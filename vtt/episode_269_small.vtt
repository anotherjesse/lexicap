00:00.000 --> 00:10.520
 The following is a conversation with Lee Cronin, a chemist from the University of Glasgow who's one of the most fascinating, brilliant, out of the box thinking scientists have ever spoken to.

00:11.480 --> 00:26.400
 This episode was recorded more than two weeks ago. So the war in Ukraine is not mentioned. I have been spending a lot of time each day talking to people in Ukraine and Russia. I have family, friends, colleagues and loved ones in both countries.

00:26.400 --> 00:40.400
 I will try to release a solo episode on this war, but I've been failing to find the words that make sense of it, for myself and others. So I may not. I ask for your understanding no matter which path I take.

00:41.400 --> 00:51.400
 Most of my time is spent trying to help as much as I can privately. I'm talking to people who are suffering, who are angry, afraid.

00:51.400 --> 01:06.400
 When I returned to this conversation with Lee, I couldn't help but smile. He's a beautiful, brilliant and hilarious human being. He's basically a human manifestation of the mad scientist Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty.

01:06.400 --> 01:29.400
 I thought about quitting this podcast for a time, but for now at least I'll keep going. I love people too much. You the listener. I meet folks on the street or when I run. You say a few kind words about the podcast and we talk about life, the small things and the big things. All of it gives me hope.

01:29.400 --> 01:43.400
 People are just amazing. You are amazing. I ask for your support, wisdom and patience as I keep going with this silly little podcast, including through some difficult conversations.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.400
 And hopefully many fascinating and fun ones too.

01:49.400 --> 02:01.400
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Lee Cronin.

02:02.400 --> 02:08.400
 How do you think life originated on Earth and what insights does that give us about life?

02:08.400 --> 02:18.400
 If we go back to the origin of Earth and you think about maybe 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 billion years ago, planet was quite hot. There was a limited number of minerals.

02:19.400 --> 02:27.400
 There was some carbon, some water. And I think that maybe it's a really simple set of chemistry that we really don't understand.

02:27.400 --> 02:39.400
 So that means you've got a finite number of elements that are going to react very simply with one another and out of that mess comes a cell. So literally sand turns into cells and it seems to happen quick.

02:40.400 --> 02:49.400
 So what I think I can say with some degree of I think not certainty but curiosity, genuine curiosity is that life happened fast.

02:49.400 --> 02:57.400
 Yeah. So when we say fast, this is a pretty surprising fact and maybe you can actually correct me and elaborate.

02:58.400 --> 03:05.400
 But it seems like most like 70 or 80% of the time that Earth has been around has been life on it, like some very significant percentage.

03:06.400 --> 03:13.400
 So when you say fast, like the slow part is from single cell or from bacteria to some more complicated organisms.

03:13.400 --> 03:22.400
 It seems like most of the time that Earth has been around, it's been single cell or like very basic organisms like a couple of billion years.

03:23.400 --> 03:32.400
 But yeah, you're right. That's really, I recently kind of revisited our history and saw this and I was just looking at the timeline.

03:32.400 --> 03:42.400
 Wait a minute, like how did life just spring up so quickly, like really quickly? That makes me think that it really wanted to like put another way.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
 It's very easy for life to spring.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.400
 Yeah, I agree. I think it's much more inevitable.

03:48.400 --> 03:56.400
 And I think I try to kind of not provoke but try and push chemists to think about because chemists are essential to this problem, right?

03:56.400 --> 04:01.400
 Understanding the origin of life on Earth at least because we're made of chemistry.

04:02.400 --> 04:11.400
 But I wonder if the origin of life on a planet also, the emergence of life on the planet is as common as the formation of a star.

04:12.400 --> 04:20.400
 And if you start framing it in that way, it allows you to then look at the universe slightly differently because, and we can get into this I think in quite some detail.

04:20.400 --> 04:28.400
 But I think to come back to your question, I have little idea of how life got started, but I know it was simple.

04:29.400 --> 04:45.400
 And I know that the process of selection had to occur before the biology was established so that selection built the framework from which life kind of grew in complexity and capability and functionality and autonomy.

04:45.400 --> 04:50.400
 And I think these are all really important words that we can unpack over the next while.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
 Can you say all the words again?

04:53.400 --> 04:59.400
 So you said selection, so natural selection, the original A B testing.

05:00.400 --> 05:08.400
 And then complexity and then the degree of autonomy and sophistication because I think that people misunderstand what life is.

05:08.400 --> 05:18.400
 Some people say that life is a cell and some people that say that life is a virus or life is a, you know, an on off switch.

05:19.400 --> 05:27.400
 I don't think it's that life is the universe developing a memory and the laws of physics and the way, well, there are no laws of physics.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.400
 Physics is just memory free stuff.

05:30.400 --> 05:37.400
 So there's only a finite number of ways you can arrange the fundamental particles to do the things.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.400
 Life is the universe developing a memory.

05:43.400 --> 05:49.400
 So it's like sewing a piece of art slowly and then you can look back at it.

05:50.400 --> 05:55.400
 So there's a stickiness to life.

05:55.400 --> 06:03.400
 It's like universe doing stuff and when you say memory, it's like there's a stickiness to a bunch of the stuff it's building together.

06:04.400 --> 06:12.400
 So like you can in a stable way trace back the complexity and that tells a coherent story.

06:13.400 --> 06:13.400
 Yeah.

06:14.400 --> 06:14.400
 Okay.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.400
 That's, by the way, very poetic and beautiful.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.400
 Life is the universe developing a memory.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.400
 Okay.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.400
 And then there's autonomy.

06:25.400 --> 06:31.400
 You said complexity we'll talk about, but it's a really interesting idea that selection preceded biology.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.400
 Yeah, I think.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.400
 So what, first of all, what is chemistry?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.400
 Like the sand still count as chemistry?

06:40.400 --> 06:40.400
 Sure.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.400
 I mean, as a chemist, the card carrying chemist, if I'm allowed a card, I don't know.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.400
 I don't know what I am most days.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.400
 What is the card made of?

06:47.400 --> 06:50.400
 What's the chemical composition of the card?

06:51.400 --> 06:52.400
 So what is chemistry?

06:53.400 --> 06:56.400
 Well, chemistry is the thing that happens when you bring electrons together and you form bonds.

06:57.400 --> 07:05.400
 So bonds, I say to people when they talk about life elsewhere and I just say, well, there's bonds, there's hope because bonds allow you to get heterogeneity.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.400
 They allow you to record those memories or at least on earth.

07:09.400 --> 07:18.400
 Or at least on earth, you could imagine, you know, a Stanislaw Lemtripe world where you might have life emerging or intelligence emerging before life.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.400
 That may be something like Solaris or something.

07:22.400 --> 07:36.400
 But, you know, to get to selection, if atoms can combine and form bonds, those bonds, those atoms can bond to different elements and those molecules will have different identities and interact with each other differently.

07:36.400 --> 07:43.400
 And then you can start to have some degree of causation or interaction and then selection and then existence.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.400
 And then you go up the kind of the path of complexity.

07:49.400 --> 08:00.400
 And so at least on earth, as we know it, there is a sufficient pool of available chemicals to start searching that combinatorial space or bonds.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.400
 So, okay, this is a really interesting question.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
 Let's lay it out.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.400
 So, bonds, almost like cards.

08:08.400 --> 08:13.400
 We say there's bonds, there is life, there's intelligence, there's consciousness.

08:14.400 --> 08:25.400
 And what you just made me realize is those can emerge or let's put bonds aside, those can emerge in any order.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.400
 That's really brilliant.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.400
 So, intelligence can come before life.

08:31.400 --> 08:40.400
 It's like, panpsychists believe that consciousness, I guess, comes before life and before intelligence.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.400
 So, consciousness permeates all matter.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.400
 It's some kind of fabric of reality.

08:46.400 --> 08:54.400
 So, within this framework, you can kind of arrange everything, but you need to have the bonds that precedes everything else.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.400
 Oh, and the other thing is selection.

08:56.400 --> 09:05.400
 So, the mechanism of selection, that could proceed, couldn't that proceed bonds to whatever the hell selection is?

09:06.400 --> 09:08.400
 So, I would say that there is an elegant order to it.

09:09.400 --> 09:19.400
 Bonds allow selection, allows the emergence of life, allows the emergence of multicellularity and then more information processing, building state machines all the way up.

09:19.400 --> 09:27.400
 However, you could imagine a situation if you had, I don't know, a neutron star or a sun or what, a ferromagnetic loops interacting with one another.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.400
 And these oscillators building state machines and these state machines reading something out in the environment.

09:33.400 --> 09:41.400
 Over time, these state machines would be able to literally record what happened in the past and sense what's going on in the present and imagine the future.

09:41.400 --> 09:48.400
 However, I don't think it's ever going to be within a human comprehension, that type of life.

09:49.400 --> 09:57.400
 I wouldn't count it out because, you know, whenever you, I know in science, whenever I say something's impossible, I then wake up the next day and say, you know, that's actually wrong.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.400
 I mean, there are some limits, of course.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.400
 I don't see myself traveling fast and light anytime soon.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.400
 Eric Weinstein says that's possible, so he will say you're wrong.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.400
 Sure, but I'm an experimentalist as well.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.400
 So one of my, I have two superpowers.

10:11.400 --> 10:21.400
 My stupidity, and I don't mean that as a, you know, I'm like absolutely completely witness, but I mean my ability to kind of just start again and ask the question and then do it with an experiment.

10:22.400 --> 10:29.400
 I always wanted to be a theoretician growing up, but I just didn't have the, just didn't have the intellectual capability, but I was able to think of experiments in my head.

10:29.400 --> 10:38.400
 I could then do in my lab or in the, you know, when I was a child outside and then those experiments in my head and then outside reinforced one another.

10:39.400 --> 10:43.400
 So I think that's a very good way of kind of grounding the science, right?

10:44.400 --> 10:48.400
 Well, that's the nice way to think about theoreticians is they're just people who run experiments in their head.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.400
 I mean, that's exactly what Einstein did, right?

10:51.400 --> 10:57.400
 But you're also capable of doing that in the head, in your head, inside your head and in the real world and the connection between the two.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.400
 The connection between the two is when you first discovered your superpower stupidity.

11:02.400 --> 11:02.400
 I like it.

11:03.400 --> 11:03.400
 Okay.

11:04.400 --> 11:04.400
 What's the second superpower?

11:05.400 --> 11:05.400
 Your accent?

11:06.400 --> 11:07.400
 Or is that?

11:08.400 --> 11:09.400
 Well, I don't know.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.400
 I am genuinely curious.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.400
 So I have a, you know, like everybody, ego problems, but my curiosity is bigger than my ego.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.400
 So as long as that happens, I can, I can.

11:20.400 --> 11:20.400
 That's awesome.

11:21.400 --> 11:21.400
 That is so powerful.

11:21.400 --> 11:26.400
 You're just dropping some powerful lines of curiosity is bigger than ego.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.400
 That's something I have to think about because you always struggle about the role of ego in life.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.400
 And that's, that's so nice to think about.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.400
 Don't think about the size of ego, the absolute size of ego.

11:39.400 --> 11:43.400
 Think about the relative size of ego to the other, the other horses pulling at you.

11:43.400 --> 11:50.400
 And if the curiosity one is bigger than ego will do just fine and make you fun to talk to.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.400
 Anyway, so those are the two superpowers.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.400
 How do those connect to natural selection or selection and bonds?

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
 And I forgot already life and consciousness.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.400
 So we're going back to selection in the universe and origin of life on earth.

12:03.400 --> 12:08.400
 I mean, selection is a, I'm convinced that selection is a force in the universe.

12:08.400 --> 12:20.400
 So not mean not a fundamental force, but a, but a directing, but it is a directing force because existence, although existence appears to be the default, the existence of what?

12:21.400 --> 12:27.400
 Why does, we can get to this later, I think, but it's amazing that, that discrete things exist.

12:28.400 --> 12:33.400
 And, you know, you see this cup, it's not the, you know, sexiest cup in the world, but it's pretty functional.

12:33.400 --> 12:38.400
 This cup, the complexity of this cup isn't just in the object.

12:39.400 --> 12:45.400
 It is literally the lineage of people making cups and recognizing that, seeing that in their head, making an abstraction of a cup and then making a different one.

12:46.400 --> 12:51.400
 So I wonder how many billions of cups have, you know, come before this one.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
 And that's a process of selection and existence.

12:54.400 --> 12:59.400
 And the only reason the cup is still uses quite useful like the handle, you know, it's convenient so I don't die and keep hydration.

12:59.400 --> 13:05.400
 And so I think we are missing something fundamental in the universe about selection.

13:06.400 --> 13:10.400
 And I think what biology is, is a, is a selection amplifier.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.400
 And that the, this is where autonomy comes in.

13:14.400 --> 13:22.400
 And actually I think that how humanity is going to humans and, and autonomous robots or whatever we're going to call them in the future, we'll, we'll supercharge that even further.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.400
 So selection is happening in the universe.

13:25.400 --> 13:33.400
 But if you look in the asteroid belt selection, if objects are being kicked in and out the asteroid belt, those trajectories are quite complex.

13:34.400 --> 13:38.400
 You don't really look at that as productive selection because it's not doing anything to improve its function.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.400
 But is it the asteroid belt has existed for some time.

13:43.400 --> 13:51.400
 So there is some selection going on, but the functionalities is somewhat limited on earth at the formation of earth.

13:51.400 --> 13:58.400
 Interaction of chemicals and molecules in the environment gave selection and then things could happen.

13:59.400 --> 14:06.400
 Because you could think about in chemistry, we can have an infinite number of reactions happen, but they don't all have, all the reactions are allowed to happen, don't happen.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.400
 Why? Because they're energy barriers.

14:09.400 --> 14:18.400
 So there must be some things called catalysts out there or there are bits of minerals that when two molecules get together on that mineral, it lowers the energy barrier for the reaction.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.400
 And so the reaction is promoted.

14:21.400 --> 14:27.400
 So suddenly you get one reaction over another series of possibilities occurring that makes a particular molecule.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.400
 And this keeps happening in steps.

14:30.400 --> 14:40.400
 And before you know it, these almost these waves as discrete reactions work together and you start to build a machinery that is run by existence.

14:40.400 --> 14:54.400
 So as you go forward in time, the fact of the molecules, the bonds are getting, there are more bonds in a molecule, there's more function, there's more capability for this molecule to interact with other molecules to redirect them.

14:55.400 --> 15:03.400
 It's like a series of little, and I don't want to use this term too much, but it's almost thinking about the simplest von Neumann constructor.

15:04.400 --> 15:08.400
 That's the simplest molecule that could build a more complicated molecule to build a more complicated molecule.

15:08.400 --> 15:17.400
 And before you know it, when that more complicated molecule can act on the causal chain that's produced itself and change it, suddenly you start to get towards some kind of autonomy.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.400
 And that's where life I think emerges in earnest.

15:20.400 --> 15:42.400
 Every single word in the past few paragraphs, let's break those apart. Who's von Neumann, what's the constructor, the closing of the loop that you're talking about, the molecule that starts becoming, I think you said like the smallest von Neumann constructor, the smallest, the minimal.

15:42.400 --> 15:50.400
 So what do all those things mean and what are we supposed to imagine when we think about the smallest von Neumann constructor?

15:51.400 --> 16:04.400
 So John von Neumann is a real hero, actually, not just me, but many people, I think, computer science and physics. He was an incredible intellect who probably solved a lot of the problems that we're working on today and just forgot to write them down.

16:04.400 --> 16:14.400
 And I'm not sure if it's John von Neumann or Johnny as I think his friends called him, but I think he was Hungarian mathematician, came to the US.

16:15.400 --> 16:26.400
 And basically he was involved in the Manhattan Project and developing computation and came up with all sorts of ideas and I think it was one of the first people to come up with cellular automata.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.400
 Really? I didn't know this little fact.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.400
 I think so.

16:31.400 --> 16:36.400
 Well, anyway, if he didn't come up with it, he probably did come up with it and didn't write it down.

16:37.400 --> 16:43.400
 There was a couple of people did at the same time and then Conway obviously took it on and then Wolfram loves CAs, there is his fabric of the universe.

16:44.400 --> 16:55.400
 And what I think he imagined was that he wasn't satisfied and this may be incorrect recollection, so a lot of what I say is going to be kind of just way out of my...

16:55.400 --> 17:01.400
 You're just part of the universe creating its memory, designing...

17:02.400 --> 17:03.400
 Exactly, rewriting history.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.400
 Exactly, imperfectly.

17:06.400 --> 17:16.400
 But what I mean is I think he liked this idea of thinking about how could a Turing machine literally build itself without a Turing machine, right?

17:17.400 --> 17:18.400
 It's like literally how did state machines emerge?

17:18.400 --> 17:27.400
 And I think that von Neumann constructors, he wanted to conceive of a minimal thing, autonomous, that could build itself.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.400
 And what would those rules look like in the world?

17:30.400 --> 17:32.400
 And that's what a von Neumann kind of constructor looked like.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.400
 Like it's a minimal hypothetical object that could build itself, self replicate.

17:36.400 --> 17:54.400
 And I'm really fascinated by that because I think that although it's probably not exactly what happened, it's a nice model because as chemists, if we could go back to the origin of life and think about what is a minimal machine that can get structured randomly?

17:54.400 --> 18:05.400
 So like with no prime mover, with no architect, it assembles through just existence.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
 So random stuff bumping in together and you make this first molecule.

18:08.400 --> 18:16.400
 So you have molecule A and molecule A interacts with another random molecule B and they get together and they realize by working together they can make more of themselves.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.400
 But then they realize they can mutate so they can make AB prime.

18:20.400 --> 18:37.400
 So AB prime is different to AB and then AB prime can then act back where A and B are being created and slightly nudge that causal chain and make AB prime more evolvable or learn more.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.400
 So that's the closing the loop part.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.400
 Closing the loop part.

18:42.400 --> 18:46.400
 It feels like the mutation part is not that difficult.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.400
 It feels like the difficult part is just creating a copy of yourself at step one.

18:51.400 --> 19:03.400
 That seems like one of the greatest inventions in the history of the universe is the first molecule that figured out, holy shit, I can create a copy of myself.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
 How hard is that?

19:07.400 --> 19:08.400
 I think it's really, really easy.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.400
 Okay, I did not expect that.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.400
 I think it's really, really easy.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.400
 Well, let's take a step back.

19:14.400 --> 19:18.400
 I think replicating molecules are rare.

19:19.400 --> 19:23.400
 But if you say, you know, I think I was saying on, I probably got into trouble on Twitter though.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
 There's about more than 18 mils of water in there.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.400
 So one mole of water, 6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.400
 That's about the number of stars in the universe, I think of the order.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.400
 So there's three universe worth.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.400
 Somebody corrected you on Twitter.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.400
 I'm always being corrected.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.400
 But there's a lot of molecules in the water.

19:44.400 --> 19:56.400
 So although it's for you and me really hard to conceive of, if existence is not the default for a long period of time, because what happens is the molecules get degraded.

19:57.400 --> 20:01.400
 So much of the possibilities in the universe are just broken back into atoms.

20:02.400 --> 20:06.400
 So you have this kind of destruction of the molecules for our chemical reactions.

20:06.400 --> 20:15.400
 So you only need one or two molecules to become good at copying themselves for them suddenly to then take resources in the pool and start to grow.

20:16.400 --> 20:21.400
 And so then replication actually over time, when you have bonds, I think is much simpler and much easier.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.400
 And I even found this in my lab years ago.

20:25.400 --> 20:32.400
 I had one of the reasons I started doing inorganic chemistry and making rust, making a bit of rust based on a thing called molybdenum.

20:32.400 --> 20:37.400
 Molybdenum oxide is this molybdenum oxide, very simple.

20:38.400 --> 20:49.400
 But when you add acid to it and some electrons, they make these molecules, you just cannot possibly imagine would be constructed big gigantic wheels of 154 molybdenum atoms in a wheel.

20:50.400 --> 20:54.400
 Or I cost a dodecahedron 132 molybdenum atoms all in the same pot.

20:55.400 --> 21:00.400
 And I realized when I, and I just finished experiments two years ago, I've just published a couple of papers on this.

21:00.400 --> 21:09.400
 That there actually, there is a random small molecule with 12 atoms in it that can form randomly, but it happens to template its own production.

21:10.400 --> 21:16.400
 And then by chance, it templates the ring, just an accident, just like just an absolute accident.

21:17.400 --> 21:21.400
 And that ring also helps make the small 12 mer.

21:21.400 --> 21:33.400
 And so you have what's called an auto catalytic set where A makes B and B helps make A and vice versa, and you then make this loop.

21:34.400 --> 21:42.400
 So it's a bit like these, they all work in synergy to make this chain of events that grow.

21:42.400 --> 21:53.400
 And it doesn't take a very sophisticated model to show that if you have these objects are competing and then collaborating to help one another build, they just grow out of the mess.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.400
 And although they seem improbable, they are improbable.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.400
 In fact, impossible in one step.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.400
 There's multiple steps.

22:03.400 --> 22:10.400
 This is when the blind people look at the blind watchmaker argument and talk about how could a watch something spontaneously emerge.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.400
 Well, it doesn't.

22:12.400 --> 22:17.400
 It's a lineage of watches and cruder devices that are bootstrapped onto one another.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.400
 Right.

22:20.400 --> 22:34.400
 So it's very improbable, but once you get that little discovery, like with the wheel and fire, it just explodes in, because it's so successful, it explodes.

22:34.400 --> 22:45.400
 This is basically selection. So this templating mechanism that allows you to have a little blueprint for yourself, how you go through different procedures to build copies of yourself.

22:45.400 --> 23:01.400
 So in chemistry somehow, it's possible to imagine that that kind of thing is easy to spring up in more complex organisms. It feels like a different thing and much more complicated.

23:02.400 --> 23:06.400
 We're having multiple abstractions of the birds and the bees conversation here.

23:06.400 --> 23:14.400
 But with human, sorry, with complex organisms, it feels like difficult to have reproduction to...

23:15.400 --> 23:18.400
 That's going to get clipped out. I'm going to make fun of that.

23:20.400 --> 23:30.400
 It's difficult to develop this idea of making copies of yourself or no, because that seems like a magical idea for life to...

23:30.400 --> 23:46.400
 Wow. That feels like very necessary for what selection is, for what evolution is, but then if selection precedes all of this, then maybe these are just like echoes of the selecting mechanism at different scales.

23:47.400 --> 23:51.400
 Yeah, that's exactly it. So selection is the default in the universe, if you want to.

23:51.400 --> 24:00.400
 And what happens is that life, the solution that life has got on Earth, life on Earth, biology on Earth, is unique to Earth.

24:01.400 --> 24:14.400
 We can talk about that. And that was really hard fought for, but that is a solution that works on Earth, the ribosome, the fundamental machine that is responsible for every cell on Earth,

24:14.400 --> 24:23.400
 of wherever it is in the thick kingdom of life. That is an incredibly complex object, but it was evolved over time and it wasn't involved in a vacuum.

24:24.400 --> 24:35.400
 And I think that once we understand that selection can occur without the ribosome, but what the ribosome does, it's a phase transition in replication.

24:35.400 --> 24:43.400
 And I think that that and also technology that is probably much easier to get to than we think.

24:44.400 --> 24:51.400
 Why do you put the ribosome as the central part of living organisms on Earth?

24:52.400 --> 24:56.400
 It basically is a combination of two different polymer systems, so RNA and peptides.

24:56.400 --> 25:06.400
 So the RNA world, if you like, gets transmitted and builds proteins and the proteins are responsible for all the catalysis, the majority of the catalysis goes on the cell.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.400
 No ribosome, no proteins, no decoding, no evolution.

25:11.400 --> 25:20.400
 So the ribosome is looking at the action. You don't put like the RNA itself as the critical thing, like information, you put action as the most important thing.

25:20.400 --> 25:28.400
 Yeah, I think the actual molecules that we have in biology right now entirely contingent on the history of life on Earth, there are so many possible solutions.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.400
 And this is where chemistry gets itself into, origin of life chemistry gets itself into a bit of a trap.

25:33.400 --> 25:38.400
 Yeah, let me interrupt you there. You've tweeted, you're going to get, I'm going to set your tweets like it's Shakespeare.

25:39.400 --> 25:45.400
 Okay. It's surprising you haven't gotten canceled on Twitter yet. Your brilliance once again saves you.

25:45.400 --> 25:50.400
 I'm just kidding. You like to have a little bit of fun on Twitter.

25:51.400 --> 25:55.400
 You've tweeted that quote, origin of life research is a scam.

25:56.400 --> 26:04.400
 So if this is Shakespeare, can we analyze this word? Why is the origin of life research a scam? Aren't you kind of doing origin of life research?

26:04.400 --> 26:15.400
 Okay, it was tongue in cheek, but yeah, I think, and I meant it as tongue in cheek. I'm not doing the origin of life research. I'm trying to make artificial life.

26:16.400 --> 26:22.400
 I also want to bound the likelihood of the origin of life on Earth, but more importantly, to find origin of life elsewhere.

26:23.400 --> 26:30.400
 But let me directly address the tweet. There are many, many good chemists out there doing origin of life research, but I want to nudge them.

26:30.400 --> 26:37.400
 And I think they're brilliant. There's no question. The chemistry they are doing, their motivation is great.

26:38.400 --> 26:53.400
 So what I meant by that tweet is saying that maybe they're making assumptions about saying if only I could make this particular type of molecule, say this RNA molecule or this phosphodiester or this other molecule,

26:53.400 --> 27:01.400
 it's going to somehow unlock the origin of life. And I think that origin of life has been looking at this for a very long time.

27:02.400 --> 27:15.400
 And whilst I think it's brilliant to work out how you can get to those molecules, I think that chemistry and chemists doing origin of life could be nudged into doing something even more profound.

27:15.400 --> 27:26.400
 And so the argument I'm making, it's a bit like right now, let's say, I don't know, the first Tesla that makes its way to, I don't know, into a new country in the world.

27:27.400 --> 27:31.400
 Let's say there's a country X that has never had a Tesla before and they get the Tesla.

27:32.400 --> 27:39.400
 And what they do is they take the Tesla apart and say, we want to find the origin of cars in the universe and say, okay, how did this form?

27:39.400 --> 27:45.400
 And how did this form? And they just randomly keep making till they make the door, they make the wheel, they make the steering column and all this stuff.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.400
 And they say, oh, that's the root. That's the way cars emerge on Earth.

27:50.400 --> 27:55.400
 But actually, we know that there's a causal chain of cars going right back to Henry Ford and the horse and carriage.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.400
 And before that, maybe, you know, people were using wheels.

27:59.400 --> 28:09.400
 And I think that obsession with the identities that we see in biology right now are giving us a false sense of security about what we're looking for.

28:10.400 --> 28:21.400
 And I think the origin of life chemistry is in danger of not making the progress that it deserves because the chemists are doing this.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.400
 The field is exploding right now.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.400
 There's amazing people out there, young and old doing this.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.400
 And there's deservedly so more money going in.

28:30.400 --> 28:34.400
 You know, I used to complain, there's more money being spent searching for the Higgs boson that we know exists in the origin of life.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.400
 You know, why is that?

28:37.400 --> 28:38.400
 We understand the origin of life.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.400
 We're going to actually work out what life is.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.400
 We're going to be at a bound, the likelihood of finding life elsewhere in the universe.

28:45.400 --> 28:50.400
 And most important for us, we are going to know or have a good idea what the future of humanity looks like.

28:50.400 --> 28:56.400
 You know, we need to understand that although we're precious, we're not the only life forms in the universe.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.400
 Well, that's my very strong impression.

28:59.400 --> 28:59.400
 I have no data for that.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.400
 It's just right now a belief.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.400
 And I want to turn that belief into a more than a belief by experimentation.

29:07.400 --> 29:16.400
 But coming back to the scam, the scam is if we just make this RNA, we've got this, you know, this fluke event, we know how that's simple.

29:16.400 --> 29:21.400
 Let's make this phosphodiester or let's make ATP or ATP, we've got that part nailed.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.400
 Let's now make this other molecule, another molecule.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.400
 And how many molecules are going to be enough?

29:26.400 --> 29:42.400
 And then the reason I say this is when you go back to Craig Venter, when he invented his life form, Cyndia, this micro, this minimal plasmid, is a myoplasma, something I don't know the name of it.

29:42.400 --> 29:46.400
 But he made this wonderful cell and said, I've invented life.

29:47.400 --> 29:48.400
 Not quite.

29:49.400 --> 29:56.400
 He facsimilied the genome from this entity and made it in the lab or the DNA, but he didn't make the cell.

29:57.400 --> 30:01.400
 He had to take an existing cell that has a causal chain going all the way back to Luca.

30:02.400 --> 30:08.400
 And he showed when he took out the gene, the genes and put in his genes, synthesized, the cell could boot up.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.400
 But it's remarkable that he could not make a cell from scratch.

30:12.400 --> 30:22.400
 And even now today, synthetic biologists cannot make a cell from scratch because there's some contingent information embodied outside the genome in the cell.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.400
 And that is just incredible.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.400
 So there's lots of layers to the scam.

30:27.400 --> 30:36.400
 Well, let me then ask the question, how can we create life in a lab from scratch?

30:37.400 --> 30:41.400
 What have been the most promising attempts at creating life in the lab from scratch?

30:42.400 --> 30:43.400
 Has anyone actually been able to do it?

30:44.400 --> 30:47.400
 Do you think anyone will be able to do it in the near future if they haven't already?

30:49.400 --> 30:54.400
 Yeah, I think that nobody has made life in the lab from scratch.

30:54.400 --> 30:57.400
 Lots of people would argue that they have made progress.

30:58.400 --> 31:03.400
 I think the synthesis of a synthetic genome milestone in human achievement, brilliant.

31:04.400 --> 31:14.400
 Can we just walk back and say, what would you say from your perspective, one of the world experts in exactly this area, what does it mean to create life from scratch?

31:14.400 --> 31:23.400
 Or if you sit back, whether you do it or somebody else does it, it's like, damn, this is, we just created life.

31:24.400 --> 31:34.400
 Well, I can tell you what I would expect, I would like to be able to do is to go from sand to cells in my lab.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.400
 Can you explain what sand is?

31:39.400 --> 31:40.400
 Just inorganic stuff.

31:40.400 --> 31:49.400
 Like basically just so sand, it's just silicon oxide with some other ions in it, maybe some inorganic carbon, some carbonates.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.400
 Just basically clearly dead stuff that you could just grind rocks into sand.

31:55.400 --> 32:05.400
 And it would be what, in a kind of vacuum, so they could remove anything else that could possibly be like a shadow of life that can assist in the chemical.

32:06.400 --> 32:06.400
 You could do that.

32:06.400 --> 32:13.400
 You could insist and say, look, I'm going to take, not just inorganic, I want some more, I want to cheat and have some organic, but I want inorganic organic.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.400
 And I'll explain the play on words in a moment.

32:16.400 --> 32:34.400
 So I would like to basically put into a world, say a completely, you know, a synthetic world, if you like, a closed world, put some inorganic materials and just literally add some energy in some form, be it lightning or heat, UV light, and run this thing in cycles.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.400
 Over time, and let it solve the search problem.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.400
 So I see the origin of life as a search problem in chemical space.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.400
 And then I would wait, literally wait for a life form to crawl out of the test tube.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.400
 That's a joke I tell my group.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.400
 Literally wait for a very, don't worry, it's going to be very feeble.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.400
 It's not going to take over the world.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.400
 You know, there's ways of ethically containing it.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.400
 Famous last words.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.400
 Indeed, indeed, indeed.

32:59.400 --> 33:03.400
 You know, this is being recorded, right?

33:04.400 --> 33:08.400
 It will not make you look good once it crawls out of the lab and destroys all human civilization.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.400
 But there is a very good things you can do to prevent that.

33:13.400 --> 33:22.400
 For instance, if you put stuff in your world, which isn't earth abundant, so let's say we make life based on molybdenum and it escapes, it would die immediately because there's not enough molybdenum in the environment.

33:22.400 --> 33:45.400
 So we can do responsible life or as I fantasize with my research group on our away day that would go in, I think it's actually morally, if we don't find, until humanity finds life in the universe, this is going on the tangent, it's our moral obligation to make origin of life bombs, identify dead planets and bomb them with our origin of life machines and make them alive.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.400
 I think it is our moral obligation to do that.

33:48.400 --> 33:53.400
 Some people might argue with me about that, but I think that we need more life in the universe.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.400
 And then we kind of forget we did it and then come back.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.400
 So where did you come from?

34:02.400 --> 34:03.400
 But coming back to what I'd expect.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.400
 Father, are you back?

34:06.400 --> 34:08.400
 I think this is once again a Rick and Morty episode.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.400
 Definitely all Rick and Morty all the way down.

34:11.400 --> 34:28.400
 So I imagine we have this pristine experiment and everything is sanitized and we put in inorganic materials and we have cycles, whether they're night cycles, up, down, whatever, and we look for evidence of replication and evolution over time.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.400
 And that's what the experiment should be.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.400
 Now, are there people doing this in the world right now?

34:33.400 --> 34:35.400
 There are a couple of, there's some really good groups doing this.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.400
 There's some really interesting scientists doing this around the world.

34:38.400 --> 34:50.400
 They're kind of perhaps too much associated with the scam and so they're using molecules that are already invented by biology.

34:51.400 --> 34:56.400
 So there's a bit of replication built in, but I still think the work they're doing is amazing.

34:57.400 --> 35:05.400
 But I would like people to be a bit freer and say, let's just basically shake a load of sand in a box and wait for life to come out because that's what happened on Earth.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.400
 And so that we have to understand that.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.400
 Now, how would I know I've been successful?

35:10.400 --> 35:19.400
 Well, because I'm not obsessing with what molecules are in life now, I would wager a vast quantity of money.

35:20.400 --> 35:26.400
 I'm not very rich, so just be a few dollars, but for me, the solution space will be different.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.400
 So the genetic material will be not RNA.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.400
 The proteins will not be what we think.

35:32.400 --> 35:49.400
 The solutions will be just completely different and it might be very feeble because that's the other thing we should be able to show fairly robustly that even if I did make or someone did make a new life form in the lab, it would be so poor that it's not going to leap out.

35:49.400 --> 36:03.400
 It is the fear about making a lethal life form in a lab from scratch is similar to us imagining that we're going to make the terminator at Boston Dynamics tomorrow.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.400
 And the problem is we don't communicate that properly.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.400
 I know you explain this very well.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.400
 There is not the AI catastrophic coming.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.400
 We're very far away from that.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.400
 That doesn't mean we should ignore it.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.400
 Same with the origin of life catastrophic, it's not coming anytime soon.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.400
 We should ignore it, but we shouldn't let that fear stop us from doing those experiments.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.400
 But this is a much, much longer discussion because there's a lot of details there.

36:30.400 --> 36:36.400
 I would say there is potential for catastrophic events to happen in much dumber ways.

36:36.400 --> 36:47.400
 In AI space, there's a lot of ways to create social networks that are creating a kind of accelerated set of events that we might not be able to control.

36:48.400 --> 37:02.400
 The social network, the virality in the digital space can create mass movements of ideas that can then, if times are tough, create military conflict and all those kinds of things.

37:02.400 --> 37:08.400
 But that's not super intelligent AI that's an interesting at scale application of AI.

37:09.400 --> 37:16.400
 If you look at viruses, viruses are pretty dumb, but at scale, their application is pretty detrimental.

37:16.400 --> 37:38.400
 Origin of life, much like all of the kind of virology, the very contentious word of gain of function research and virology, research on viruses, messing with them genetically, that can create a lot of problems if not done well.

37:38.400 --> 37:58.400
 So we have to be very cautious. So there's a kind of whenever you're ultra cautious about stuff in AI or in virology and biology, it borders on cynicism, I would say, where it's like everything we do is going to turn out to be destructive and terrible.

37:59.400 --> 38:05.400
 So I'm just going to sit here and do nothing. Okay, that's a possible solution except for the fact that somebody's going to do it.

38:05.400 --> 38:27.400
 It's science and technology progresses. So we have to do it in an ethical way in a good way, considering in a transparent way in an open way, considering all the possible positive trajectories that could be taken and making sure as much as possible that we walk those trajectories.

38:27.400 --> 38:35.400
 So yeah, I don't think Terminator is coming, but a totally unexpected version of Terminator maybe around the corner.

38:36.400 --> 38:50.400
 Yeah, it might be here already. Yeah. So I agree with that. And so going back to the origin of life discussion, I think that in synthetic biology right now, we have to be very careful about how we edit genomes and edit synthetic biology to do things.

38:50.400 --> 38:58.400
 So that's kind of, that's where things might go wrong in the same way as, you know, Twitter turning ourselves into kind of strange scale effects.

38:59.400 --> 39:05.400
 I would love origin of life research or artificial life research to get to the point where we have those worries.

39:06.400 --> 39:12.400
 Because that's why I think we're just so far away from that. We are just, you know, right now, I think there are two really important angles.

39:12.400 --> 39:21.400
 There is the origin of life people, researchers who are faithfully working on this and trying to make those molecules, the scam molecules I talked about.

39:22.400 --> 39:30.400
 And then there are people on the creationist side is saying, look, the fact you can't make these molecules and you can't make a cell means that evolution isn't true and all this other stuff.

39:31.400 --> 39:37.400
 Gotcha. Yeah. And so, and I find that really frustrating because actually the origin of life researchers are all working in good faith, right?

39:37.400 --> 39:46.400
 Yes. And so what I'm trying to do is give origin of life research a little bit more of an open context.

39:47.400 --> 39:51.400
 And one of the things I think is important, I really want to make a new life form in my lifetime.

39:52.400 --> 40:05.400
 I really want to prove that life is a general phenomena, a bit like gravity in the universe, because I think that's going to be really important for humanities, global psychological state, meaning going forward.

40:05.400 --> 40:25.400
 That's beautifully put. So one, it will help us understand ourselves. So that's useful for science. But two, it gives us a kind of hope, if not an awe at all the huge amounts of alien civilizations that are out there.

40:25.400 --> 40:37.400
 If you can build life and understand just how easy it is to build life, then that's just as good, if not much better than discovering life on another planet.

40:37.400 --> 40:54.400
 Yeah. It's, I mean, it's cheaper. It's much cheaper and much easier and probably much more conclusive because once you're able to create life, like you said, it's a search problem that there's probably a lot of different ways to do it.

40:55.400 --> 41:01.400
 So once you create the, once you find the first solution, you probably have all the right methodology for finding all kinds of other solutions.

41:01.400 --> 41:09.400
 Yeah. And wouldn't it be great if we could find a solution? I mean, it's probably a bit late for, I mean, I worry about climate change, but I'm not that worried about climate change.

41:10.400 --> 41:17.400
 And I think one day you could think about, could we engineer a new type of life form that could basically, and I don't want to do this.

41:18.400 --> 41:24.400
 So I don't think we should do this necessarily, but it's a good thought experiment that would perhaps take CO2 out of the atmosphere or an intermediate life form.

41:24.400 --> 41:36.400
 So it's not quite alive. It's almost like an add on that we can, with a time dependent add on, you could give to say cyanobacteria in the ocean or to maybe to wheat.

41:37.400 --> 41:43.400
 So right, we're just going to fix a bit more CO2 and we're going to work out how much we need to fix to basically save the climate.

41:44.400 --> 41:48.400
 And we're going to use evolutionary principles to basically get there.

41:48.400 --> 41:55.400
 What worries me is that biology has had a few billion years to find a solution for CO2 fixation, hasn't really done.

41:56.400 --> 42:01.400
 It's not, the solution isn't brilliant for our needs, but biology wasn't thinking about our needs. Biology was thinking about biology's needs.

42:02.400 --> 42:10.400
 But I think if we can do, as you say, make life in the lab, then suddenly we don't need to go to everywhere and conclusively prove it.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.400
 I think we make life in the lab. We look at the extent of life in the solar system.

42:13.400 --> 42:20.400
 How far did Earth life get? Probably world martians, probably life got going on Mars, the chemistry on Mars, seeded Earth.

42:21.400 --> 42:24.400
 That might have been a legitimate way to kind of truncate the surface.

42:25.400 --> 42:31.400
 But in the outer solar system, we might have completely different life forms on Enceladus, on Europa and Titan.

42:32.400 --> 42:32.400
 And that would be a cool thing because...

42:33.400 --> 42:35.400
 Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

42:35.400 --> 42:44.400
 Did you just say that you think, in terms of likelihood, life started on Mars, statistically speaking, life started on Mars and seeded Earth?

42:45.400 --> 42:52.400
 It could be possible because Mars was habitable for the type of life that we have right now, type of chemistry before Earth.

42:53.400 --> 42:56.400
 So it seems to me that Mars got searching doing chemistry.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.400
 It started way before.

42:59.400 --> 43:06.400
 Yeah, and so they had a few more replicators and some other stuff, and if those replicators got ejected from Mars and landed on Earth,

43:07.400 --> 43:09.400
 and Earth would be like, I don't need to start again.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.400
 Thanks for that, and then it just carries on.

43:13.400 --> 43:23.400
 So I think we will find evidence of life on Mars, either life we put there by mistake, contamination, or actually life, the earliest remnants of life.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.400
 And that would be really exciting. It's a really good reason to go there.

43:26.400 --> 43:32.400
 But I think it's more unlikely because of the gravitational situation in the solar system if we find life in the outer solar system.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.400
 Titan and all that, that would be its own thing.

43:36.400 --> 43:37.400
 Wow, that would be so cool.

43:38.400 --> 43:42.400
 If we go to Mars and we find life that looks a hell of a lot similar to Earth life,

43:43.400 --> 43:48.400
 and then we go to Titan and all those weird moons with the ices and the volcanoes and all that kind of stuff,

43:49.400 --> 43:54.400
 and then we find there something that looks, I don't know, way weirder.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.400
 Some other, some non RNA type of situation.

43:58.400 --> 44:00.400
 Almost life, like in the prebiotic chemical space.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.400
 And I think there are four types of exoplanets we can go look for, right?

44:04.400 --> 44:07.400
 Because when JWST goes up and touch wood, it goes up and everything's fine.

44:08.400 --> 44:12.400
 When we look at a star, statistically, most stars have planets around them.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.400
 What type of planet are they? Are they going to be dead?

44:15.400 --> 44:19.400
 Are they going to be just a prebiotic origin of life coming?

44:20.400 --> 44:21.400
 So are they going to be technological?

44:21.400 --> 44:24.400
 Are they going to be technological? So we have intelligence on them.

44:25.400 --> 44:26.400
 And will they have died?

44:27.400 --> 44:29.400
 So, you know, from, you know, had life on them.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.400
 Those are the four states of the world.

44:32.400 --> 44:35.400
 And so, and suddenly it's a bit like I want to classify planets the way we classify stars.

44:36.400 --> 44:37.400
 Yeah.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.400
 And I think that in terms of rather than having this, oh, we've found, we found methane.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.400
 There's evidence of life. We found oxygen. That's the evidence of life.

44:44.400 --> 44:50.400
 We found whatever molecule marker and start to then frame things a little bit more.

44:51.400 --> 44:55.400
 As those four states, which by the way, you're just saying four, but there could be if

44:56.400 --> 45:01.400
 before the dead, there could be other states that we humans can even conceive of.

45:02.400 --> 45:05.400
 Yeah, just prebiotic, almost alive, you know, got the possibility to come alive.

45:06.400 --> 45:07.400
 I think.

45:08.400 --> 45:11.400
 But there could be a post technological, like whatever we think of as technology,

45:11.400 --> 45:19.400
 that could be like pre conscious, like where we all meld into one super intelligent

45:20.400 --> 45:23.400
 conscious or some weird thing that naturally happens over time.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.400
 Yeah, I mean, I think that all bets.

45:27.400 --> 45:28.400
 The metaverse.

45:29.400 --> 45:34.400
 We join into a virtual metaverse and start creating, which is kind of an interesting idea,

45:34.400 --> 45:41.400
 almost arbitrary number of copies of each other much more quickly to what can mess with different ideas in mind.

45:42.400 --> 45:47.400
 Like I can create a thousand copies of Lex, like every possible version of Lex.

45:48.400 --> 45:52.400
 And then just see like, and then I just have them like argue with each other and like until,

45:53.400 --> 45:55.400
 like in the space of ideas and see who wins out.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.400
 How could that possibly go wrong?

45:57.400 --> 46:03.400
 But anyway, but there's, especially in this digital space where you could start exploring with AI's mix,

46:04.400 --> 46:06.400
 then you could start engineering arbitrary intelligences.

46:07.400 --> 46:14.400
 You can start playing in the space of ideas, which might move us into a world that looks very different than a biological world.

46:15.400 --> 46:20.400
 Our current world, the technology is still very much tied to our biology.

46:21.400 --> 46:23.400
 We might move past that completely.

46:24.400 --> 46:25.400
 We definitely will.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.400
 Definitely, because that could be another phase then.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.400
 But I did say technological, so I think I agree with you.

46:31.400 --> 46:32.400
 Let's get this right.

46:33.400 --> 46:35.400
 Dead world, no prospect of life.

46:36.400 --> 46:40.400
 Prebiotic world, life emerging, living and technological.

46:41.400 --> 46:44.400
 And the dead one, you probably won't be able to tell between the dead never been alive and the dead one,

46:45.400 --> 46:47.400
 maybe lots of artifacts and maybe there's five.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.400
 There's probably not more than five.

46:49.400 --> 46:55.400
 And I think the technological one could have life on it still, but it might just have exceeded.

46:56.400 --> 47:03.400
 Because one way that life might survive on Earth is if we can work out how to deal with the real climate change that comes when the sun expands.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.400
 It might be a way to survive that.

47:09.400 --> 47:14.400
 But yeah, I think that we need to start thinking statistically when it comes to looking for life in the universe.

47:14.400 --> 47:25.400
 Let me ask you then sort of statistically how many alien civilizations are out there in those four phases that you're talking about.

47:26.400 --> 47:37.400
 When you look up the stars and you're sipping on some wine and talking to other people with British accents about something intelligent and intellectual, I'm sure.

47:37.400 --> 47:44.400
 Do you think there's a lot of alien civilizations looking back at us and wondering the same?

47:45.400 --> 47:51.400
 My romantic view of the universe is really taking loans from my logical self.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.400
 So what I'm saying is I have no idea.

47:55.400 --> 48:03.400
 But having said that, there is no reason to suppose that life is as hard as we first thought it was.

48:03.400 --> 48:15.400
 And so if we just take Earth as a marker, and if I think that life is a much more general phenomena than just our biology, then I think the universe is full of life.

48:16.400 --> 48:21.400
 And the reason for the Fermi paradox is not that they're not out there.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.400
 It's just that we can't interact with the other life forms because they're so different.

48:25.400 --> 48:32.400
 And I'm not saying that they're necessarily like, hasn't depicted in a rival or other.

48:33.400 --> 48:39.400
 I'm just saying that perhaps there are very few universal facts in the universe.

48:40.400 --> 48:46.400
 And maybe our technologies are quite divergent.

48:47.400 --> 48:51.400
 And so I think that it's very hard to know how we're going to interact with alien life.

48:51.400 --> 48:54.400
 You think there's a lot of kinds of life that's possible. I guess that was the intuition.

48:55.400 --> 49:19.400
 You provided that the way biology itself, but even this particular kind of biology that we have on Earth, is something that is just one sample of nearly infinite number of other possible complex autonomous self replicating type of things that could be possible.

49:19.400 --> 49:26.400
 And so we're almost unable to see the alternative versions of us.

49:27.400 --> 49:32.400
 I mean, we'll still be able to detect them. We'll still be able to interact with them.

49:33.400 --> 49:41.400
 We'll still be able to, what exactly is lost in translation? Why can't we see them? Why can't we talk to them?

49:41.400 --> 50:03.400
 Because I too have a sense, you put it way more poetically, but it seems both statistically and sort of romantically, it feels like the universe should be teaming with life, like super intelligent life.

50:03.400 --> 50:21.400
 And I just, I sit there and the Fermi paradox is felt very distinctly by me when I look up at the stars, because it's the same way I feel when I'm driving through New Jersey and listening to Bruce Springsteen and feel quite sad.

50:21.400 --> 50:32.400
 It's like Lucy K talks about pulling off to the side of the road and just weeping a little bit. I'm almost like wondering like, hey, why, why aren't you talking to us?

50:33.400 --> 50:36.400
 You know, it feels lonely. It feels lonely because it feels like they're out there.

50:37.400 --> 50:49.400
 I think that there are a number of answers to that. I think the Fermi paradox is perhaps based on the assumption that if life did emerge in the universe, it would be similar to our life and there's only one solution.

50:49.400 --> 50:59.400
 And I think that what we've got to start to do is go out and look for selection detection rather than an evolution detection rather than life detection.

51:00.400 --> 51:08.400
 And I think that once we start to do that, we might start to see really interesting things. And we haven't been doing this for very long.

51:09.400 --> 51:13.400
 And we are living in an expanding universe and that makes the problem a little bit harder.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.400
 Everybody's always leaving.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.400
 Distance wise.

51:19.400 --> 51:26.400
 I'm very optimistic that we will, well, I don't know, there are two movies that came out within six months of one another.

51:27.400 --> 51:34.400
 Ad Astra and Cosmos. Ad Astra, the very expensive blockbuster with Brad Pitt in it and saying there is no life.

51:35.400 --> 51:43.400
 Life on Earth has more pressures than Cosmos, which is a UK production which basically aliens came and visited Earth one day and they were discovered in the UK.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.400
 It was quite, it's a fun film.

51:47.400 --> 52:00.400
 But I really loved those two films and at the same time, at the time those films were coming out, I was working on a paper, a life detection paper and it was so hard to publish this paper.

52:00.400 --> 52:13.400
 And it was almost as, I got so depressed trying to get this science out there that I felt the depression of the film in Ad Astra like life, there's no life elsewhere in the universe.

52:14.400 --> 52:23.400
 But I'm incredibly optimistic that I think we will find life in the universe, firm evidence of life and it will have to start on Earth, making life on Earth and surprising us.

52:24.400 --> 52:27.400
 We have to surprise ourselves and make non biological life on Earth.

52:27.400 --> 52:34.400
 And then people say, well, you made this life on Earth, therefore, you're part of the causal chain of that and that might be true.

52:35.400 --> 52:54.400
 But if I can show how I'm able to do it with very little cheating or very little information inputs, just creating like a model planet, some description and watching life emerge, then I think that we will be even to persuade even the hardest critic that it's possible.

52:54.400 --> 53:00.400
 Now, with regards to the Fermi paradox, I think that we might crush that with the JWST.

53:01.400 --> 53:14.400
 It's basically, if I recall correctly, the mirror is about 10 times the size of the Hubble, that we're going to be able to do spectroscopy, look at colors of exoplanets, I think, not brilliantly, but we'll be able to start to classify them.

53:14.400 --> 53:32.400
 And we'll start to get a real fit feel for what's going on in the universe on these exoplanets because it's only in the last few decades, I think, maybe even last decade that we even came to recognize that exoplanets even are common.

53:32.400 --> 53:45.400
 And I think that that gives us a lot of optimism that life is going to be out there. But I think we have to start framing, we have to start preparing the fact that biology is only one solution.

53:46.400 --> 53:53.400
 I can tell you with confidence that biology on Earth does not exist anywhere else in the universe. We are absolutely unique.

53:53.400 --> 54:06.400
 Well, okay, I love the confidence, but where does that confidence come from? Chemistry, how many options does chemistry really have?

54:07.400 --> 54:15.400
 Many, that's the point. And the thing is, this is where the origin of life scam comes in, is that people don't count the numbers.

54:15.400 --> 54:28.400
 So if biology, as you find on Earth, is common everywhere, then there's something really weird going on that basically written in the quantum mechanics, there's some kind of these bonds must form over these bonds and this catalyst must form over this catalyst when they're all quite equal.

54:29.400 --> 54:37.400
 Life is contingent. The origin of life on Earth was contingent upon the chemistry available at the origin of life on Earth.

54:37.400 --> 54:53.400
 So that means if we want to find other lifelike worlds, we look for the same kind of rocky world, we might look in the same zone as Earth and we might expect reasonably to find biological like stuff going on.

54:54.400 --> 55:01.400
 That would be a reasonable hypothesis, but it won't be the same. It can't be. It's like saying, I don't believe in magic. That's why I'm sure.

55:01.400 --> 55:10.400
 I just don't believe in magic. I believe in statistics and I can do experiments. And so I won't get the same, exactly the same sequence of events. I'll get something different.

55:11.400 --> 55:17.400
 And so there is TikTok elsewhere in the universe, but it's not the same as our TikTok, right? That's what I mean.

55:18.400 --> 55:19.400
 Which aspect of it is not the same?

55:20.400 --> 55:27.400
 Well, I just think, so what is TikTok? TikTok is a social media where people upload videos, right? Silly videos.

55:27.400 --> 55:41.400
 So I guess there might be... Well, there's humor, there's attention, there's ability to process, there's ability for intelligent organisms to collaborate on ideas and find humor and ideas and play with those ideas, make them viral memes.

55:42.400 --> 55:45.400
 Humor seems to be kind of fundamental to the human experience.

55:46.400 --> 55:53.400
 And I think that that's a really interesting question we can ask. Is humor a fundamental thing in the universe? I think maybe it will be, right?

55:53.400 --> 56:05.400
 In terms of you think about in a game theoretic sense, humor, the emergence of humor serves a role in our game engine. And so if selection is fundamental in the universe, so is humor.

56:06.400 --> 56:18.400
 Well, I actually don't know exactly what role humor serves. Maybe it's from a chemical perspective. It's like a catalyst for...

56:18.400 --> 56:24.400
 I guess it's of several purposes. One is the catalyst for spreading ideas on the internet. That's modern humor.

56:25.400 --> 56:34.400
 But humor is also a good way to deal with the difficulty of life. It's a kind of valve, release valve for suffering.

56:35.400 --> 56:46.400
 Throughout human history, life has been really hard. And for the people that I've known in my life who've lived through some really difficult things, humor is part of how they deal with that.

56:46.400 --> 56:58.400
 It's usually dark humor. But yeah, it's interesting. I don't know exactly what's the more mathematically general way to formulate what the hell is humor?

56:59.400 --> 57:13.400
 What humor does it serve? But I still... We're kind of joking here, but it's a counterintuitive idea to me to think that life elsewhere in the universe

57:13.400 --> 57:25.400
 is very different than life on Earth. And also, each instantiation of life is likely very different from each other.

57:26.400 --> 57:36.400
 Maybe there's a few clusters of similar life, but it's much more likely, to me, it's kind of a novel thought. I'm not sure what to do with it.

57:36.400 --> 57:47.400
 But you're saying that it's more common to be a weird outcast in the full spectrum of life than it is to be in some usual cluster.

57:48.400 --> 57:58.400
 So every instantiation of a kind of chemistry that results in complexity, that's autonomous and self replicating, however the hell you define life, that is going to be very different every time.

57:58.400 --> 58:12.400
 I don't know. It feels like a selection is a fundamental kind of directed force in the universe. Won't selection result in a few pockets of interesting complexities?

58:13.400 --> 58:24.400
 Yeah, if we ran Earth over again, over and over and over, you're saying it's going to come up, but there's not going to be elephants every time?

58:24.400 --> 58:35.400
 Yeah, I don't think so. I think that there will be similarities. And I think we don't know enough about how selection globally works.

58:36.400 --> 58:49.400
 But it might be that the emergence of elephants was wired into the history of Earth in some way, like the gravitational force, how evolution was going, the Cambrian explosions, blah, blah, blah, the emergence of mammals.

58:49.400 --> 59:06.400
 But I just don't know enough about the contingency, the variability. All I do know is you count the number of bits of information required to make an elephant and think about the causal chain that provides the lineage of elephants going all the way back to Luca.

59:07.400 --> 59:09.400
 There's a huge scope for divergence.

59:09.400 --> 59:28.400
 Yeah, but just like you said, with chemistry and selection, the things that result in self replicating chemistry and self replicating organisms, those are extremely unlikely, as you're saying.

59:28.400 --> 59:47.400
 But once they're successful, they multiply. So it might be a tiny subset of all things that are possible in the universe, chemically speaking, it might be a very tiny subset is actually successful at creating elephants, or elephant like, or slash human like creatures.

59:48.400 --> 59:52.400
 Well, there's two different questions. The first one, if we were to reset Earth and to start again.

59:53.400 --> 59:54.400
 At the different phases, sorry to keep interrupting.

59:54.400 --> 1:00:05.400
 Yeah, no, if we restart Earth and start again, say we could go back to the beginning and do the experiment or have a number of Earths, how similar would biology be? I would say that there would be broad similarities.

1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:14.400
 But the emergence of mammals is not a given unless we're going to throw an asteroid at each planet each time and try and faithfully reproduce what happened.

1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:29.400
 Then there's the other thing about when you go to another Earth like planet elsewhere, maybe there's a different ratio, particular elements, maybe there's the bombardment at the beginning of the planet was quicker or longer than Earth.

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:41.400
 And I just don't have enough information that what I do know is that the complexity of the story of life on Earth gives us lots of scope for variation.

1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:50.400
 And I just don't think it's a reasonable mathematical assumption to think that the life on Earth that happened again would be same as what we have now.

1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:51.400
 Okay.

1:00:52.400 --> 1:01:01.400
 But you've also extended that to say that we might, as an explanation for the Fermi paradox, that that means we're not able to interact with them.

1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:09.400
 Or that's an explanation for why we haven't at scale heard from aliens is they're different than us.

1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:12.400
 We've only been looking for say 70, 80 years.

1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:18.400
 So I think that with the reason we have not found aliens yet is that we haven't worked out what life is.

1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:23.400
 No, but the aliens have worked that out surely.

1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:32.400
 I mean, statistically speaking, there must be a large number of aliens that are way ahead of us on this whole life question.

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:42.400
 Unless there's something about this stage of intellectual evolution that often quickly results in nuclear war and destroys itself.

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:54.400
 There's something in this process that eventually, I don't know, crystallizes the complexity and it stops, either dies or stops developing.

1:01:54.400 --> 1:02:05.400
 But most likely they already figured it out and why aren't they contacting us as some grad student somewhere wants to study a new green planet?

1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:07.400
 Maybe they have.

1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:18.400
 I mean, I don't have a coherent answer to your question other than to say that if there are other aliens out there and they're far more advanced, they might be in contact with each other.

1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:25.400
 And they might also, we might be at a point where what I'm saying quite critically is it takes two to talk, right?

1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:34.400
 So the aliens might be there, but if we don't have the ability to recognize them and talk to them, then the aliens aren't going to want to talk to us.

1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:44.400
 And I think that's a critical point and probably if that's a filter, there needs to be an ability for one to communicate with the other.

1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:47.400
 And we need to know what life is before we do that.

1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:51.400
 So we haven't qualified to even join the club to have a talk.

1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:54.400
 Well, I think they still want to teach us how to talk, right?

1:02:55.400 --> 1:03:01.400
 But my worry is that, or I think they would want to teach us how to talk like you do when you meet it.

1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:18.400
 I was going to say child, but that's a human species and you want to try to communicate with them through whatever devices you can, given what an ant is like.

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:24.400
 I worry mostly about that humans are just too close minded or don't have the right tools.

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:33.400
 I'm going to push back on this quite significantly. I would say because we don't understand what life is and because we don't understand how life emerged in the universe.

1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:37.400
 We don't understand the physics that gave rise to life yet.

1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:42.400
 Fundamental description, I'm way out of my pay grade, even further out.

1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:44.400
 But I'll say it anyway, because I think it's fun.

1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:47.400
 You don't get paid much anyway, as you said earlier.

1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:54.400
 So I would say that because we don't understand the universe yet, we do not understand how the universe spat out life.

1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:56.400
 And we don't know what life is.

1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:04.400
 And I think that until we understand that, it is going to limit our ability to even we don't qualify to talk to the aliens.

1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:11.400
 So I'm going to say that they might be there, but I'm not going to say that I believe in interdimensional aliens being present.

1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:15.400
 Yeah, but I think you're just being self critical, like we don't qualify.

1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:18.400
 I think the fact that we don't qualify qualifies us.

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:21.400
 We're interesting in our innocence.

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:28.400
 No, I'm saying that because we don't understand causal chains and the way that information is propagated in the universe.

1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:34.400
 And we don't understand what replication is yet and we don't understand how life emerged.

1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:37.400
 I think that we would not recognize aliens.

1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:45.400
 And if someone doesn't recognize you, you wouldn't go and talk to it. You don't go and talk to ants.

1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:49.400
 You don't go and talk to birds or maybe some birds you do, right? Because you can.

1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:51.400
 There's just enough cognition.

1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:57.400
 So I'm saying because we don't have enough cognitive, our cognitive abilities are not yet where they need to be.

1:04:58.400 --> 1:04:59.400
 We probably haven't been communicating with them.

1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:03.400
 So you don't agree with the dating strategy of playing hard to get?

1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:06.400
 Because us humans, that seems to attract us.

1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:10.400
 We're in a species that's fine, but I think we don't actually have abstraction.

1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:19.400
 No, actually, I think in this talk, in this conversation, you've helped me crystallize something that I think has been troubling me for a long time with the thermi paradox.

1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:29.400
 I'm pretty sure that a reasonable avenue is to say that you would not go and talk to your cat about calculus, right?

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:31.400
 But I was so petty.

1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:33.400
 Sure, but I'm not talking about petting a cat.

1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:40.400
 The analogy is that the aliens are not going to talk to us because we, and I'm using calculus as an analogy for abstraction.

1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:49.400
 Because we lack the layer, the fundamental layer of understanding what life is and what the universe is in our reality.

1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:58.400
 It would be so counterproductive interacting with intelligent alien species that it would cause more angst for human race.

1:05:58.400 --> 1:06:00.400
 But they don't care.

1:06:01.400 --> 1:06:02.400
 Okay, they got to be self interested.

1:06:03.400 --> 1:06:06.400
 So they'll probably, they more care about, is it interesting for them?

1:06:07.400 --> 1:06:16.400
 Maybe they, I mean, surely there's a way to pet the cat in this analogy.

1:06:17.400 --> 1:06:26.400
 Because even if we lack complete understanding, it must be a very frustrating experience for other kinds of intelligences to communicate with us.

1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:28.400
 Still, there must be a way to interact with us.

1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:35.400
 Well, like perturb the system in interesting ways to see what these creatures do.

1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:37.400
 We might actually find the answer.

1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:46.400
 I mean, again, out of my pay grade in, in a simulation of Earth or say, let's say a simulation where we allow an intelligent AI to emerge, right?

1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:55.400
 And that, and that AI, we then give it the objective is to be curious, interact with other intelligence in its universe.

1:06:56.400 --> 1:07:01.400
 And then we might find the, the parameters required for that AI to work.

1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:10.400
 And I think you'll find if the AI will not talk to other AI's that don't share the ability to abstract the level of the AI, because it's just a cat.

1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:14.400
 And would you, are you going to travel 20 light years to go and pet a cat?

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:21.400
 So not because of the inability to do so, but because of like boredom is it, it's more interested.

1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:31.400
 It will start talking to, it will spend most, it will spend a majority of its time talking to other AI systems that can at least someone understand.

1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:32.400
 It's much more fun.

1:07:33.400 --> 1:07:34.400
 It's a bit like, do we know that plants are conscious?

1:07:35.400 --> 1:07:37.400
 Well, plants unconscious in the way we typically think, but we don't talk to them.

1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:38.400
 They could be, right?

1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:40.400
 Yeah, but there's a lot of people on Earth who like gardening.

1:07:41.400 --> 1:07:42.400
 There's always going to be a weird.

1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:43.400
 They're not talking, they're just gardening.

1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:48.400
 Okay. Well, you're not romantic enough to see gardening as a way of communication between humans and plants.

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:49.400
 Oh, okay. You've got me there.

1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:54.400
 But there's ways, there's always going to be the people who are curious.

1:07:55.400 --> 1:07:57.400
 Jane Goodall, who lives with the chimps, right?

1:07:58.400 --> 1:08:05.400
 There's always going to be curious intelligence species that visit the weird Earth planet and try to interact.

1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:11.400
 I mean, it's a, yeah, I think it's a super cool idea that you're expressing.

1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:22.400
 I just kind of have a sense, maybe it's a hope that there's always going to be a desire to interact, even with those that don't, can't possibly understand the depth of what you understand.

1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:28.400
 So I'm with you, so I want to be as positive as you that the aliens do exist and we will interact with them.

1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:34.400
 What I'm trying to do is to give you a reasonable hypothesis why we haven't yet.

1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:38.400
 And also something to strive for to be able to do that.

1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:45.400
 I mean, I, you know, there is the other view that the universe is just too big and life is just too rare.

1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:54.400
 But I want to come up with an alternative explanation, which I think is reasonable and not being philosophically and scientifically thought out,

1:08:54.400 --> 1:09:04.400
 which is this, if you can't actually communicate with the object, the person, the thing competently, you don't even know it's there, then there's no point yet.

1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:10.400
 See, I disagree with that, but I'm totally aligned with your hopeful vision, which is like, we need to understand the origin of life.

1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:12.400
 It will help us engineer life.

1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:20.400
 It will help us engineer intelligent life through perhaps on the computer side through simulation and explore all the ways that life emerges.

1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:29.400
 And that will allow us to, I think the fundamental reason we don't see overwhelming amounts of life is I actually believe aliens.

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:34.400
 Of course, these are all just kind of open minded beliefs.

1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:43.400
 It's difficult to know for sure about any of this, but I think there's a lot of alien civilizations which are actively communicating with us and we're too dumb.

1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:46.400
 We don't have the right tools to see it.

1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:48.400
 That's what I'm saying.

1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:56.400
 No, but maybe I misinterpreted you, but I interpreted you just say they kind of tried a few times and they're like, oh God.

1:09:57.400 --> 1:09:57.400
 No, no, no.

1:09:58.400 --> 1:09:59.400
 What I'm saying is we, so this goes two ways.

1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:01.400
 Yeah, I agree with you.

1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:05.400
 There could be information out there, but just put in such a way that we just don't understand it yet.

1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:06.400
 Right.

1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:08.400
 So sorry if I didn't make that clear.

1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:14.400
 I mean, it's not just, I don't think we, I think we qualify as soon as we can decode their signal.

1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:15.400
 Right.

1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:17.400
 So when you say qualify, gotta got it.

1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:19.400
 So you mean we're just not smart enough.

1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:20.400
 The word qualify will stop me off.

1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:22.400
 So we're not smart enough to do it.

1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:24.400
 But we just need to get smarter.

1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:30.400
 And there's a lot of people who believe, let me get your opinion on this, about UFO sightings.

1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:40.400
 So sightings of weird phenomena that, you know, what does UFO mean?

1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:49.400
 It means it's a flying object and it's not identified clearly at the time of sighting.

1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:51.400
 That's what UFO means.

1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:55.400
 So it could be a physics phenomena, it could be ball lightning, it could be all kinds of fascinating.

1:10:56.400 --> 1:11:05.400
 I was always fascinated with ball lightning as a, like the fact that there could be physical phenomena in this world that are observable by the human eye.

1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:13.400
 Of course, all physical phenomena generally are fascinating that are, that really smart people can't explain.

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:17.400
 I love that because it's like, wait a minute, especially if you can replicate it.

1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:19.400
 It's like, wait a minute, how does this happen?

1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:25.400
 That's like the precursor to giant discoveries in chemistry and biology and physics and so on.

1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:28.400
 But it sucks when those events are super rare, right?

1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:34.400
 Like leg ball lightning, so that's out there.

1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:41.400
 And then, of course, that phenomena could have other interpretations that don't have to do with the physics and chemistry, the biology of Earth.

1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:54.400
 It could have to do with more extraterrestrial explanations that, in large part, thanks to Hollywood and movies and all those kinds of things, captivates the imaginations of millions of people.

1:11:54.400 --> 1:12:04.400
 But just because it's science fiction that captivates the imagination of people doesn't mean that some of those sightings, all it takes is one.

1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:16.400
 One of those sightings is actually a sign that it's extraterrestrial intelligence, that it's an object that's not of this particular world.

1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:18.400
 Do you think there's a chance that that's the case?

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:21.400
 What do you make, especially the pilot sightings, what do you make of those?

1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:34.400
 So, I agree there's a chance, there's always a chance, any good scientist would have to, or observationist would have to, you know, I want to see if aliens exist, come to Earth.

1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:42.400
 What I know about the universe is I think it's unlikely right now that there are aliens visiting us, but not impossible.

1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:52.400
 I think the release is the dramatization that's been happening politically saying we're going to release all this information, this classified information.

1:12:53.400 --> 1:13:00.400
 I was kind of disappointed because it was just very poor material.

1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:11.400
 And right now, the ability to capture high resolution video, everybody is carrying around with them an incredible video device now.

1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:17.400
 And we haven't got more compelling data.

1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:26.400
 And so that we've just seen grainy pictures, a lot of hearsay, instrument kind of malfunctions and whatnot.

1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:32.400
 And so I think on balance, I think it's extremely unlikely, but I think something really interesting is happening.

1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:41.400
 And also during the pandemic, right, we've all been locked down, we all want to have, we want to, our imaginations are, you know, running riot.

1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:48.400
 And I think that the, I don't think that the information out there is convinced me there are any, anything interesting on the UFO side.

1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:59.400
 But what it has made me very interested in about is how humanity is opening up its mind to ponder aliens and the mystery of our universe.

1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:05.400
 And so I don't want to dissuade people from having those thoughts and say, you're stupid and look at that, it's clearly incorrect.

1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:07.400
 That's not right. That's not fair.

1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:15.400
 What I would say is that I lack sufficient data, replicated observations to make me go, oh, I'm going to take this seriously.

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:20.400
 But I'm really interested by the fact that there is this great deal of interest.

1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:32.400
 And I think that it drives me to maybe want to make an artificial life form even more and to help NASA and the Air Force and whoever go and look for things even more.

1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:35.400
 Because I think humanity wants to know what's out there.

1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:37.400
 There's this yearning, isn't there?

1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:47.400
 Yeah, but I see, I almost, depending on the day, I sometimes agree with you, but with the thing you just said.

1:14:48.400 --> 1:15:04.400
 But one of the disappointing things to me about the sightings, I still hold the belief that a nonzero number of them is an indication of something very interesting.

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:12.400
 So I don't side with the people who say everything can be explained with like sensor artifacts kind of thing.

1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:16.400
 Yeah, I agree with you. I didn't say that either. I would say I just don't have enough data.

1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:22.400
 But the thing I want to push back on is the statement that everybody has a high definition camera.

1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:31.400
 One of the disappointing things to me about the report that the government released, but in general, having worked with government, having worked with people all over,

1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:45.400
 is how incompetent we are, like if you look at the response to the pandemic, how incompetent we are in the face of great challenges without great leadership,

1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:51.400
 how incompetent we are in the face of the great mysteries before us without great leadership.

1:15:51.400 --> 1:16:00.400
 And I just think it's actually the fact that there's a lot of high definition cameras is not enough to capture the full richness of weird,

1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:07.400
 of the mysterious phenomenon out there, of which extraterrestrial intelligence visiting Earth could be one.

1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:14.400
 I don't think we have, I don't think everybody having a smartphone in their pocket is enough.

1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:22.400
 I think that allows for TikTok videos. I don't think it allows for the capture of even interesting relatively rare human events.

1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:29.400
 That's not that common. It's rare to have been the right moment in the right time to be able to capture the thing.

1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:36.400
 I agree. I agree. Let me rephrase what I think on this. I haven't seen enough information. I haven't really actively sought it out.

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:43.400
 I must admit, but I'm with you in that I love the idea of anomaly detection in chemistry in particular.

1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:50.400
 I want to make anomalies, sorry, or not necessarily make anomalies. I want to understand an anomaly.

1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:55.400
 Let me give you two from chemistry, which are really quite interesting.

1:16:55.400 --> 1:17:07.400
 Flaugiston going way back where people said this is thing called Flaugiston and for ages, the alchemists got really this kind of the fire is the thing.

1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:12.400
 That's one and we determined that Flaugiston wasn't what we thought it is.

1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:20.400
 Let's go to physics, the ether. The ethers are a hard one because I think actually the ether might exist and I'll tell you what I think the ether is later.

1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:24.400
 Can you explain ether?

1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:33.400
 The light traveling through the ether in the vacuum, there is some thing that we call the ether that basically mediates the movement of light.

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:38.400
 Then the other one is cold fusion, which is more of a…

1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:49.400
 A few years ago, people observed that when they did some electrochemistry, when they were splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, that you got more energy out than you put in.

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:53.400
 People got excited and they thought that this was a nuclear reaction.

1:17:54.400 --> 1:17:59.400
 In the end, it was kind of discredited because you didn't detect neutrons and all that stuff.

1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:05.400
 I'm pretty sure, I'm a chemist, I'm telling you this on your podcast, but why not?

1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:10.400
 I'm pretty sure there's interesting electrochemical phenomena that's not completely bottomed out yet, that there is something there.

1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:14.400
 However, we lack the technology and the experimental design.

1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:21.400
 All I'm saying in your response about aliens is that we lack the experimental design to really capture these anomalies.

1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:26.400
 We are encircling the planet with many more detection systems.

1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:28.400
 We've got satellites everywhere.

1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:37.400
 I do hope that we are going to discover more anomalies and remember that the solar system isn't just static in space, it's moving through the universe.

1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:39.400
 There's just more and more chance.

1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:49.400
 I'm not one with Avi Loeb, he's generating all sorts of kind of a cult, I would say, with this, but I'm not against him.

1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:55.400
 I think there is a finite chance, if there are aliens in the universe, that we're going to happen upon them because we're moving through the universe.

1:18:55.400 --> 1:18:58.400
 What's the nature of the following that Avi Loeb has?

1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:03.400
 He's doubling down more and more and more and say there are aliens, interdimensional aliens and everything else, right?

1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:09.400
 He's gone from space junk accelerating out of to interdimensional stuff in a very short space of time.

1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:11.400
 I see.

1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:12.400
 He's obviously bored.

1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:17.400
 Or he wants to tap into the psyche and understand.

1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:27.400
 He's playfully kind of trying to interact with society and his peers to say, stop saying it's not possible, which I agree with, we shouldn't do that.

1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:34.400
 But we should frame it statistically in the same way we should frame everything as good scientists, statistically.

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:46.400
 Yeah, good scientists. Recently, the idea of good scientists is, I take it quite skeptically.

1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:51.400
 I've been listening to a lot of scientists tell me about what is good science.

1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:55.400
 That makes me sad because you've been interviewed, what I would consider a lot of really good scientists.

1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:57.400
 No, that's true.

1:19:57.400 --> 1:20:04.400
 But that's exactly right and most of the people I talk to are incredible human beings, but there's a humility that's required.

1:20:05.400 --> 1:20:08.400
 Science cannot be dogmatism.

1:20:09.400 --> 1:20:10.400
 Sure, I agree.

1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:15.400
 Authority, a PhD does not give you authority.

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:19.400
 A lifelong pursuit of a particular task does not give you authority.

1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:25.400
 You're just as lost and clues as everybody else, but you're more curious and more stubborn.

1:20:25.400 --> 1:20:28.400
 So that's a nice quality to have.

1:20:29.400 --> 1:20:49.400
 But overall, just using the word science and statistics can often, as you know, kind of become a catalyst for dismissing new ideas out of the box ideas, wild ideas, all that kind of stuff.

1:20:49.400 --> 1:21:03.400
 Well, yes and no, I think that some people find me extremely annoying in science because I'm basically quite rude and disruptive.

1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:07.400
 Not in a rude, you know, some people say they're ugly or stupid or anything like that.

1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:11.400
 I just say, you know, you're wrong.

1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:13.400
 Or why do you think this?

1:21:13.400 --> 1:21:21.400
 And something, a gift I got given by society when I was very young because I was in the learning difficulties class at school was I was told I was stupid.

1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:26.400
 And so I know I know I'm stupid, but I always wanted to be smart, right?

1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:31.400
 I remember going to school going, maybe today they're going to tell me I'm not as stupid as I was yesterday.

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:33.400
 And it was always disappointed, always.

1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:38.400
 And so when I went into academia and everyone says, you're wrong, I was like, join the queue.

1:21:38.400 --> 1:21:42.400
 Because it allowed me to walk through the, you know, the wall.

1:21:43.400 --> 1:21:50.400
 So I think that people like to always imagine science as a bit like living in a Japanese house, paper walls, everyone sits in their paper in their room.

1:21:51.400 --> 1:21:56.400
 And I annoy people because I walk straight through the wall, not because why should I be a chemist and not a mathematician?

1:21:57.400 --> 1:21:59.400
 Why should I be a mathematician and not computer scientist?

1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:06.400
 Because if the problem requires us to walk through those walls, but I like walking through the walls.

1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:11.400
 But then I have to put up, you know, I have to do good science.

1:22:12.400 --> 1:22:19.400
 I have to win the people in those rooms across by good science, by taking their criticisms and addressing them head on.

1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:21.400
 And I think we must do that.

1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:24.400
 And I think that I try and do that in my own way.

1:22:25.400 --> 1:22:27.400
 And I kind of love walking through the walls.

1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:33.400
 And it gives me, it's difficult for me personally, it's quite painful.

1:22:33.400 --> 1:22:38.400
 But it always leads to a deeper understanding of the people I'm with.

1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:42.400
 In particular, you know, the arguments I have with all sorts of interesting minds.

1:22:43.400 --> 1:22:47.400
 Because I want to solve the problem or I want to understand more about why I exist.

1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:51.400
 You know, that's it really.

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:55.400
 And I think we have to not dismiss science on that basis.

1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:57.400
 I think we can work with science.

1:22:57.400 --> 1:23:09.400
 No, science is beautiful, but humans with egos and all those kinds of things can sometimes misuse good things like social justice.

1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:19.400
 Like all ideas were all aspired to misuse these beautiful ideas to manipulate people to all those kinds of things.

1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:26.400
 And there's assholes in every space and walk of life, including science.

1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:29.400
 And those are no good, but yes, you're right.

1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:33.400
 The scientific method has proven to be quite useful.

1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:44.400
 That said, for difficult questions, for difficult explanations for rare phenomena, you have to walk cautiously.

1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:55.400
 Because the scientific method, when you totally don't understand something and it's rare and you can't replicate it, doesn't quite apply.

1:23:56.400 --> 1:23:57.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:23:58.400 --> 1:23:58.400
 I agree with you.

1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:02.400
 The challenge is to not dismiss the anomaly because you can't replicate it.

1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:04.400
 I mean, we can talk about this.

1:24:05.400 --> 1:24:07.400
 This is something I realized when we were developing assembly theory.

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:18.400
 People think the track they're on is so dogmatic, but there is this thing that they see but they don't see.

1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:21.400
 And it takes a bit of time and you just have to keep reframing it.

1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:24.400
 And my approach is to say, well, why can't this be right?

1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:28.400
 Why must we accept that RNA is the only way into life?

1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:30.400
 I mean, who said?

1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:36.400
 Does RNA have a special class of information that's encoded in the universe?

1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:37.400
 No, of course it doesn't.

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:42.400
 You know, RNA is not a special molecule in the space of all the other molecules.

1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:50.400
 But it's so elegant and simple and it works so well for the evolutionary process that we kind of use that as an intuition to explain that that must be the only way to have life.

1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:51.400
 Sure.

1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:54.400
 But you mentioned assembly theory.

1:24:55.400 --> 1:24:55.400
 Well, first, let me pause.

1:24:56.400 --> 1:24:56.400
 Bathroom break needed?

1:24:57.400 --> 1:24:58.400
 Yeah, let's take two minutes.

1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:06.400
 We took a quick break and offline you mentioned to me that you have a lab in your home.

1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:14.400
 And then I said that you're basically Rick from Rick and Morty, which is something I've been thinking this whole conversation.

1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:22.400
 And then you say that there's a glowing pickle that you used something involving cold plasma, I believe.

1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:25.400
 I don't know, but can you explain the glowing pickle situation?

1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:36.400
 And is there many arbitrarily many versions of you in alternate dimensions that you're aware of?

1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:52.400
 I tried to make an electrochemical memory at home using a pickle and the only way I could get any traction with it was actually by plugging it into a very high voltage alternating current and then putting in a couple of electrodes.

1:25:52.400 --> 1:25:54.400
 But my kids weren't impressed.

1:25:55.400 --> 1:25:58.400
 They're not impressed with anything I do, any experiments I do at home, I think it's quite funny.

1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:00.400
 But you connected that pickle to some electrode.

1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:04.400
 240 volts AC and then had a couple of electrodes on it.

1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:08.400
 So what happens is a pickle, this is a classic thing you do.

1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:14.400
 I mean, I shouldn't pranks you do, you put a pickle into the mains and just will leave it, run away and leave it.

1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:22.400
 And what happens is it starts to decompose, heats up and then explodes because the water turns to steam and it just violently explodes.

1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:28.400
 But I wondered if I could cause the iron, sodium potassium ions in the pickle to migrate had been in a jar, right?

1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:30.400
 In a brine.

1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:36.400
 That was not my best experiment, so I've been far better experiments in my lab at home.

1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:45.400
 At that time was a failed experiment, but you never know, every experiment is a successful experiment if you stick with it long enough.

1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:50.400
 I mean, I got kicked out of my own lab by my research team many years ago and for good reason.

1:26:51.400 --> 1:26:53.400
 I mean, my team is brilliant and I used to go in and just break things.

1:26:54.400 --> 1:27:00.400
 So what I do do at home is I have a kind of electronics workshop and I prototype experiments there.

1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:05.400
 Then I try and suggest to my team sometimes, maybe we can try this thing.

1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:09.400
 And they would just say, oh, wow, that's not going to work because of this.

1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:14.400
 And I say, aha, but actually I've tried and here's some code and here's some hard work and we have a go.

1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:18.400
 So I'm doing that less and less now as I get even more busy.

1:27:19.400 --> 1:27:23.400
 But that's quite fun because then they feel that we're in the experiment together.

1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:33.400
 You do, in fact, brilliantly, just like Rick from Rick and Morty, connect up chemistry with computation.

1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:46.400
 So when we say chemistry, we don't mean the simulation of chemistry or modeling of chemistry.

1:27:46.400 --> 1:27:52.400
 We mean chemistry in the physical space as well as in the digital space, which is fascinating.

1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:54.400
 We'll talk about that.

1:27:55.400 --> 1:28:00.400
 But first you mentioned assembly theory, so we'll stick on theory in these big ideas.

1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:02.400
 I would say revolutionary ideas.

1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:06.400
 There's an intersection between mathematics and philosophy.

1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:08.400
 What is assembly theory?

1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:14.400
 And generally speaking, how would we recognize life if we saw it?

1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:16.400
 So assembly theory is a theory.

1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:24.400
 It goes back a few years now and my struggle for maybe almost 10 years when I was going to origin of life conferences and artificial life conferences,

1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:31.400
 where I thought that everybody was dancing around the problem of what life is and what it does.

1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:34.400
 But I'll tell you about what assembly theory is because I think it's easier.

1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:39.400
 So assembly theory literally says if you take an object, any given object,

1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:47.400
 and you are able to break that object into parts very gently, so just maybe let's say take a piece of very intricate Chinese porcelain,

1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:53.400
 and you tap it just with a hammer or the nail at some point, and it will fragment into many parts.

1:28:54.400 --> 1:29:00.400
 And if that object is able to fragment into many, and you count those parts, the different parts, so they're unsymmetrical.

1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:08.400
 Assembly theory says the larger the number of parts, unsymmetrical parts that object has,

1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:13.400
 the more likely it is that object has been created by an evolutionary or information process,

1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:20.400
 especially if that object is not one off, you've got an abundance of them.

1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:22.400
 And that's really important.

1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:29.400
 What I'm literally saying about the abundance, if you have a one off object and you break it into parts,

1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:38.400
 and it has lots of parts, you'd say, well, that could be incredibly intricate and complex, but it could be just random.

1:29:39.400 --> 1:29:43.400
 And I was troubled with this for years because I saw in reality that assembly theory works.

1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:50.400
 But when I talked to very good computational complexity computation lists, algorithmic complexity people,

1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:54.400
 they said, you haven't really done this properly, you haven't thought about it.

1:29:55.400 --> 1:29:56.400
 This is the random problem.

1:29:57.400 --> 1:30:04.400
 And so I kept working this up because I invented an assembly theory in chemistry, first of all, with molecules.

1:30:05.400 --> 1:30:10.400
 And so the thought experiment was, how complex does a molecule need to be when I find it,

1:30:11.400 --> 1:30:14.400
 that it couldn't possibly have risen by chance probabilistically.

1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:19.400
 And if I found this molecule able to detect enough quantities in the same object, like a machine, like a mass spectrometer.

1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:23.400
 So typically in a mass spectrometer, you weigh the molecules in electric field,

1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:27.400
 you probably have to have on the order of 10,000 identical molecules to get a signal.

1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:31.400
 So 10,000 identical molecules that are complex.

1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:35.400
 What is the chance of them occurring by chance?

1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:37.400
 Well, we can do the math.

1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:43.400
 Let's take a molecule like Strychnine or Strychnine is a good molecule actually to take.

1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:46.400
 Or Viagra is a good molecule.

1:30:47.400 --> 1:30:48.400
 I made jokes about Viagra because it's a complex molecule.

1:30:49.400 --> 1:30:53.400
 And one of my friends said, yeah, if we find Viagra on Mars in detectable quantities, we know something is up.

1:30:54.400 --> 1:30:59.400
 But anyway, it's a complex molecule.

1:31:00.400 --> 1:31:05.400
 So what you do is you take this molecule in the mass spectrometer and you hit it with some electrons or in electric field and it breaks apart.

1:31:05.400 --> 1:31:12.400
 And if the larger than the larger the number of different parts, you know, when it starts to get refresh old,

1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:16.400
 my idea was that that molecule could not be created by chance, probabilistically.

1:31:17.400 --> 1:31:22.400
 So that was where assembly thought theory was born in an experiment in a mass spec experiment.

1:31:23.400 --> 1:31:29.400
 And I was thinking about this because NASA sending the mass spectrometers to Mars to Titan is going to send them to Europa.

1:31:30.400 --> 1:31:32.400
 There's going to be a nuclear powered mass spectrometer going to Titan.

1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:34.400
 I mean, this is the coolest experiment ever.

1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:42.400
 They're not only sending a drone that's going to fly around Titan, it's going to be powered by a nuclear slug, a nuclear battery.

1:31:43.400 --> 1:31:44.400
 And it's going to have a mass spectrometer on it.

1:31:45.400 --> 1:31:46.400
 Is this already launched?

1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:50.400
 No, it's Dragonfly and it's going to be launched in a few years.

1:31:51.400 --> 1:31:52.400
 I think it got pushed a year because of the pandemic.

1:31:53.400 --> 1:31:54.400
 So I think it's real.

1:31:54.400 --> 1:32:09.400
 Dragonfly, nuclear Dragonfly is going to fly the Titan and collect data about the composition of the various chemicals on Titan.

1:32:10.400 --> 1:32:11.400
 Yeah, I'm trying to convince NASA.

1:32:12.400 --> 1:32:16.400
 I don't know if I'll be able to convince the Dragonfly team that they should apply this approach,

1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:19.400
 but they will get data and depending on how good their mass spectrometer is.

1:32:19.400 --> 1:32:23.400
 But I had this thought experiment anyway, and I did this thought experiment.

1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:25.400
 And for me, it seemed to work.

1:32:26.400 --> 1:32:29.400
 I turned the thought experiment into an algorithm in assembly theory.

1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:35.400
 And I basically, assembly theory, if I take, let's just make it generic and let's just take the word abracadabra.

1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:42.400
 So can I, if you find the word, so if you have a book with lots of words in it and you find abracadabra one off,

1:32:43.400 --> 1:32:47.400
 and there's a wrap book that's been written by, in a random way, you know, set of monkeys in a room.

1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:48.400
 Yeah, and typewriters.

1:32:49.400 --> 1:32:51.400
 And you're on typewriters and you find one off abracadabra, no big deal.

1:32:52.400 --> 1:32:56.400
 But if you find lots of recurrences of abracadabra, well, that means something weird is going on.

1:32:57.400 --> 1:32:59.400
 But let's think about the assembly number of abracadabra.

1:33:00.400 --> 1:33:04.400
 So abracadabra has a, you know, has a number of letters in it, you can break it down.

1:33:05.400 --> 1:33:06.400
 So you just cut the letters up.

1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:11.400
 But when you actually reassemble abracadabra, the minimum number of weights of organizing those letters.

1:33:12.400 --> 1:33:15.400
 So you'd have an A, a B, you know, and keep going up.

1:33:15.400 --> 1:33:22.400
 There's just the, you can, when you cut abracadabra up into parts, you can put it together again in seven steps.

1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:24.400
 So what does that mean?

1:33:25.400 --> 1:33:29.400
 That means if you basically don't read, you're allowed to reuse things you make in a chain at the beginning.

1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:33.400
 That's the memory of the universe, the process that makes abracadabra.

1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:41.400
 And because that causal chain, you can then get to abracadabra quicker than the number of letters for having to specify only in seven.

1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:51.400
 So if you take that to a molecule and you cut the molecule up into parts and you can on the causal chain and you basically start with the atoms and then bonds.

1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:57.400
 And then you randomly add on those parts to make the A, make the B, make the, and keep going all the way up.

1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:03.400
 I found that literally assembly theory allows me to say how compressed a molecule is.

1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:05.400
 So when there's some information in there.

1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:11.400
 And I realized the assembly theory isn't just confined to molecular space.

1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:14.400
 It can apply to anything, but let me finish the molecular argument.

1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:17.400
 So what I did is I had this theory.

1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:21.400
 I was one of my students, we wrote an algorithm.

1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:26.400
 We basically took 20 million molecules from the database and we just calculate their assembly number.

1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:28.400
 And that's the index.

1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:38.400
 Like basically if I take a molecule and I cut it up into bonds, what is the minimum number of steps I need to take to reform that molecule from atoms.

1:34:39.400 --> 1:34:42.400
 So reusability of previously formed things is somehow fundamental.

1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:43.400
 Exactly.

1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:45.400
 It's like a memory in the universe.

1:34:46.400 --> 1:34:47.400
 I'm making lots of leaps here.

1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:48.400
 It's kind of weird.

1:34:49.400 --> 1:34:52.400
 I'm saying, right, there's a process that can form the A and the B and the C, let's say.

1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:58.400
 And then because we've formed A and B before, we can use A and B again with no extra cost except one unit.

1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:01.400
 So that's the kind of the chain of events.

1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:10.400
 And that's how you think about memory here when you say the universe, when you talk about the universe or life is the universe creating memory.

1:35:11.400 --> 1:35:11.400
 Exactly.

1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:17.400
 So we went through chemical space and we looked at the assembly numbers and we were able to classify it.

1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:25.400
 So, okay, let's test it. Let's go. So we're able to take a whole bunch of molecules and assign an assembly index to them.

1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:26.400
 Okay.

1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:31.400
 And it's just a function of the number of bonds in the molecule and how much symmetry.

1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:37.400
 So literally assembly theory is a measure of how little symmetry a molecule has.

1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:43.400
 So the more asymmetry, the more information, the more weird it is like a Jackson Pollock or some description.

1:35:43.400 --> 1:35:48.400
 So I then went and did a load of experiments and I basically took those molecules.

1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:53.400
 I cut them up in the mass spec and measured the number of peaks without any knowledge of the molecule.

1:35:54.400 --> 1:36:02.400
 And we found the assembly number than the, there was a almost, not quite a one to one correlation, but almost because not all bonds are equal to have different energies.

1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:11.400
 I then did this using two other spectroscopic techniques, NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance, which uses radio frequency to basically jangle the molecules and get a signature out.

1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:16.400
 And they also used infrared and infrared and NMR almost gave us a one to one correlation.

1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:18.400
 So what am I saying?

1:36:19.400 --> 1:36:30.400
 I'm saying by taking a molecule and doing either infrared or NMR or mass spec, I can work out how many parts there are in that molecule and then put it on a scale.

1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:46.400
 And what we did in the next part of the work is we took molecules randomly from the environment, from outer space, from all around Earth, from the sea, from Antarctica and from fossils and so on.

1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:50.400
 And even NASA, because they didn't believe us, blinded some samples.

1:36:50.400 --> 1:37:01.400
 And then we found that all these samples that came from biology produced molecules that had a very high assembly number above a threshold of about 15.

1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:07.400
 So basically, all the other stuff that came from my ebiotic origin was low.

1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:09.400
 There was no complexity there.

1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:19.400
 So we suddenly realized that on Earth, at least there is a cutoff that natural phenomena cannot produce molecules that need more than 15 steps to make them.

1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:26.400
 So I realized that this is a way to make a scale of life, a scale of technology as well.

1:37:27.400 --> 1:37:32.400
 And literally, you could just go sniffing for molecules off Earth on Titan, on Mars.

1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:42.400
 And when you find a molecule in the mass spectrometer that gives you more than 15 parts, you'll know pretty much for sure that it had to be produced by evolution.

1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:59.400
 And this allowed me to come up with a general definition of life based on assembly theory to say that if I find an object that has a large number of parts, say an iPhone or Boeing 747 or any complex object and I can find it in abundance and cut it up,

1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:04.400
 I can tell you whether that has been produced by an informational process or not.

1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:06.400
 And that's what assembly theory kind of does.

1:38:07.400 --> 1:38:08.400
 But it goes a bit further.

1:38:09.400 --> 1:38:13.400
 I then realized that this isn't just about life, it's about causation.

1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:16.400
 So actually, it tells you about where there's a causal structure.

1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:22.400
 So now I can look at objects in the universe, say that again, there's a cup and say, right, I'm going to look at how many independent parts it has.

1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:24.400
 So that's the assembly number.

1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:30.400
 I'll then look at the abundance, how many cups are two on this table, maybe there's a few more, you got stashed away.

1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:41.400
 So assembly is a function of the complexity of the object times the number of copy numbers of that object or a function of the copy number normalized.

1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:44.400
 So I realized there's a new quantity in the universe.

1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:47.400
 You have energy, entropy and assembly.

1:38:47.400 --> 1:38:53.400
 So assembly, the way we should think about that is how much reusability there is.

1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:58.400
 Reusability is like, can you play devil's advocate to this?

1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:08.400
 So could this just be a nice tertiary signal for living organisms?

1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:16.400
 Like some kind of distant signal that's, yeah, this is a nice property, but it's not capturing something fundamental.

1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:21.400
 Or do you think reusability is something fundamental to life in complex organisms?

1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:27.400
 I think reusability is fundamental in the universe, not just for life in complex organisms, it's about causation.

1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:35.400
 So I think assembly tells you, if you find objects, because you can do this with trajectories as well, if you think about it,

1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:42.400
 the fact there are objects in the universe on Earth is weird.

1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:46.400
 You think about it, we should just have a commentary explosion of stuff.

1:39:47.400 --> 1:39:52.400
 The fact that not everything exists is really weird.

1:39:52.400 --> 1:40:07.400
 As I'm looking at two mugs and two water bottles, and the things that exist are similar and multiply in copies.

1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:15.400
 So I would say that assembly allows you to do something that statistical mechanics and people looking at entropy have got stuck with for a while.

1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:17.400
 So I'm making, it's pretty bold.

1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:20.400
 I mean, I'm writing a paper with Sarah Walker on this at the moment.

1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:29.400
 And we're realizing, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves because I think that there's lots of ways where this is, you know, it's a really interesting idea.

1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:34.400
 It works for molecules, and it appears to work for any objects produced by causation.

1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:38.400
 Because you can take a motor car, you can look at the assembly of the motor car, look at a book, look at the assembly of the book.

1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:42.400
 Assembly theory tells you there's a way of compressing and reusing.

1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:47.400
 And so when people, I talk to information theorists, they say, oh, this is just logical death.

1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:51.400
 I say it is like logical death, but it's experimentally measurable.

1:40:52.400 --> 1:40:54.400
 They say, oh, it's a bit like comagolor of complexity.

1:40:55.400 --> 1:40:56.400
 I say, but it's computable.

1:40:57.400 --> 1:41:01.400
 And now, okay, it's not infinitely computable gets MP hard very quickly, right?

1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:04.400
 It's very hard problem when you could get, but it's a computable enough.

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:11.400
 You could tractable enough to be able to tell the difference between a molecule that's been formed by the random background and by causation.

1:41:11.400 --> 1:41:19.400
 And I think that that's really interesting because until now, there's no way of measuring complexity objectively.

1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:28.400
 Complexity has required algorithmic comparisons and programs and human beings to label things.

1:41:29.400 --> 1:41:30.400
 Assembly is label free.

1:41:31.400 --> 1:41:32.400
 Well, not entirely.

1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:34.400
 We can talk about what that means in a minute.

1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:40.400
 Okay, my brain has been broken a couple of times here.

1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:42.400
 I'm sorry, I explained it really badly.

1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:44.400
 No, it was very well explained.

1:41:45.400 --> 1:41:47.400
 It was just fascinating and it's up.

1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:51.400
 My brain is broken into pieces and I'm trying to assemble it.

1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:53.400
 So, NP hard.

1:41:54.400 --> 1:42:02.400
 So, when you have a molecule, you're trying to figure out, okay, if we were to reuse parts of this molecule,

1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:10.400
 which parts can we reuse as an optimization problem and be hard?

1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:16.400
 To figure out the minimum amount of reused components that will create this molecule.

1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:22.400
 And it becomes difficult when you start to look at a huge, huge molecules arbitrarily large.

1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:24.400
 Because I'm also mapping this.

1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:27.400
 Can I think about this in complexity generally?

1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:37.400
 Like looking at a cellular automata system and saying, can this be used as a measure of complexity for an arbitrarily complicated system?

1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:39.400
 Yeah, I think it can.

1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:40.400
 It can.

1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:43.400
 And I think that the question is in what's the benefit?

1:42:44.400 --> 1:42:48.400
 Because there's plenty of, I mean, in computer science and mathematics and in physics,

1:42:49.400 --> 1:42:51.400
 people have been really seriously studying complexity for a long time.

1:42:52.400 --> 1:42:55.400
 And I think there's really interesting problems of where we coarse grade.

1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:56.400
 And we lose information.

1:42:57.400 --> 1:42:58.400
 And all assembly theory does really.

1:42:59.400 --> 1:43:01.400
 Assembly theory just explains weak emergence.

1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:07.400
 And so, what assembly theory says, look, going from the atoms that interact,

1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:09.400
 those first replicators that build one another.

1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:15.400
 Assembly at the minimal level just tells you evidence that there's been replication and selection.

1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:20.400
 And I think the more selected something is, the higher the assembly.

1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:25.400
 And so, we were able to start to know how to look for selection in the universe.

1:43:26.400 --> 1:43:31.400
 If you go to the moon, there's nothing a very high assembly on the moon except the human artifacts we've left there.

1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:34.400
 So, again, let's go back to the sandbox.

1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:38.400
 In assembly theory says, if all the sand grains could stick together,

1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:41.400
 that's the infinite combinatorial explosion in the universe.

1:43:42.400 --> 1:43:43.400
 That should be the default.

1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:44.400
 We don't have that.

1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:50.400
 Now, let's assemble sand grains together and do them in every possible way.

1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:55.400
 So, we have a series of minimal operations that can move the sand together.

1:43:56.400 --> 1:43:57.400
 But all that doesn't exist either.

1:43:58.400 --> 1:43:59.400
 Now, because we have specific memory where we say,

1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:04.400
 well, we're going to put three sand grains in a line or four and make a cross or a triangle or something unsymmetrical.

1:44:05.400 --> 1:44:07.400
 And once we've made the triangle and the unsymmetrical thing, we remember that.

1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:09.400
 We can use it again because on that causal chain.

1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:14.400
 So, what assembly theory allows you to do is go to the actual object that you find in space.

1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:18.400
 And actually, the way you get there is by disassembling it.

1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:22.400
 So, assembly theory works by disassembling objects.

1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:26.400
 You have an understanding of the steps to create them.

1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:30.400
 And it works for molecules beautifully because you just break bonds.

1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:32.400
 But like you said, assembly hard is very difficult.

1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:35.400
 It's a difficult problem to figure out how to break them apart.

1:44:35.400 --> 1:44:40.400
 For molecules, it's easy. If you just keep low enough in molecular weight space, it's good enough.

1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:42.400
 So, it's a complete theory.

1:44:43.400 --> 1:44:45.400
 When we start to think about objects, we can start to assign,

1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:48.400
 we can start to think about things at different levels, different atoms.

1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:50.400
 What do you assign as your atom?

1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:56.400
 So, in a molecule, the atom, this is really confusing because word atom, I mean smallest breakable part.

1:44:57.400 --> 1:45:01.400
 So, in a molecule, the atom is the bond because you break bonds, not atoms, right?

1:45:01.400 --> 1:45:06.400
 So, in a car, the atom might be, I don't know, a small amount of iron,

1:45:07.400 --> 1:45:12.400
 or the smallest reusable part, a rivet, a piece of plastic or something.

1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:14.400
 So, you've got to be really careful.

1:45:15.400 --> 1:45:17.400
 In a micro process, the atoms might be transistors.

1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:23.400
 And so, the amount of assembly is a function.

1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:26.400
 You have to look at the atom level.

1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:28.400
 Where are your parts? What are you counting?

1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:30.400
 That's one of the things you get to choose.

1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:33.400
 At what scale is the atom? What is the minimal thing?

1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:36.400
 I mean, there's a huge amount of tradeoffs.

1:45:37.400 --> 1:45:40.400
 When you approach a system and try to analyze, like if you approach Earth,

1:45:41.400 --> 1:45:43.400
 you're an alien civilization, try to study Earth,

1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:47.400
 what is the atom for trying to measure the complexity of life?

1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:49.400
 Are humans the atoms?

1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:52.400
 I would say to start with, you just use molecules.

1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:57.400
 I can say for sure, if there are molecules of sufficient complexity on Earth,

1:45:58.400 --> 1:45:59.400
 then I know that life has made them.

1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:01.400
 And you can go further and show technology.

1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:05.400
 There are molecules that exist on Earth that are not possible even by biology.

1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:08.400
 You needed technology and you needed micro processes to get there.

1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:10.400
 So, that's really cool.

1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:18.400
 And there's a correlation between the coolness of that and assembly number, whatever the measure.

1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:20.400
 What would you call the measure?

1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:21.400
 Assembly index.

1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:25.400
 So, there are three kind of fundamental kind of labels we have.

1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:27.400
 So, there's the quantity of assembly.

1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:31.400
 So, if you have a box, let's just have a box of molecules.

1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:33.400
 So, I'm going to have my box.

1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:35.400
 We count the number of identical molecules,

1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:39.400
 and then we chop each molecule up in an individual molecule class

1:46:40.400 --> 1:46:41.400
 and calculate assembly number.

1:46:42.400 --> 1:46:48.400
 So, basically, you then have a function that sums over all the molecules for each assembly,

1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:49.400
 and then you divide through.

1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:53.400
 So, you make it divide through by the number of molecules.

1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:55.400
 So, that's the assembly index for the box?

1:46:56.400 --> 1:46:58.400
 So, that will tell you the amount of assembly in the box.

1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:01.400
 So, basically, the assembly equation we come up with is like, basically,

1:47:02.400 --> 1:47:06.400
 the sum of e to the power of the assembly index for molecule i

1:47:07.400 --> 1:47:10.400
 times the number of copies of the molecule i, and then you normalize.

1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:12.400
 So, you sum them all up and then normalize.

1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:15.400
 So, some boxes are going to be more assembled than others.

1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:17.400
 Yeah, that's what they tell me.

1:47:18.400 --> 1:47:20.400
 So, if you were to look at me as a box, say I'm a box,

1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:26.400
 and my assemble my parts in terms of like, how do you know what's my assembly index?

1:47:27.400 --> 1:47:28.400
 So, be gentle.

1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:30.400
 So, let's just, we'll talk about the molecules in you.

1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:33.400
 So, let's just take a pile of sand the same way as you,

1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:39.400
 and I would take you and just cut up all the molecules.

1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:43.400
 I mean, and look at the number of copies and assembly number.

1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:47.400
 So, in sand, let's say, there's probably going to be nothing more than assembly number two or three,

1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:51.400
 but there might be trillions and trillions of sand grains.

1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:55.400
 In your body, there might be, the assembly number is going to be higher,

1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:00.400
 but there might not be quite as many copies because the molecular weight is higher.

1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:02.400
 So, you do want to average it out.

1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:04.400
 You do average it.

1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:06.400
 I'm not defined by the most impressive.

1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:08.400
 No, no, you're an average in your volume.

1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:10.400
 I mean, we're just working this out.

1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:14.400
 But what's really cool is that you're going to have a really high assembly.

1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:16.400
 The sand will have a very low assembly.

1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:18.400
 Your causal power is much higher.

1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:20.400
 You get to make decisions.

1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:22.400
 You're alive, you're aspiring.

1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:25.400
 Assembly says something about causal power in the universe.

1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:32.400
 And that's not supposed to exist because physicists don't accept that causation exists at the bottom.

1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:36.400
 So, I understand at the chemical level why the assembly is causation.

1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:38.400
 Why is it causation?

1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:39.400
 Because it's capturing the memory.

1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:41.400
 Exactly.

1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:44.400
 It's capturing memory, but there's not an action to it.

1:48:45.400 --> 1:48:50.400
 So, I'm trying to see how it leads to life.

1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:52.400
 Well, it's what life does.

1:48:53.400 --> 1:48:54.400
 So, I think we don't know.

1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:56.400
 It's a good question.

1:48:57.400 --> 1:48:59.400
 What is life versus what does life do?

1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:03.400
 Yeah, so this is the definition of life, the only definition we need.

1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:05.400
 What's the assembly?

1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:13.400
 In other words, life is able to create objects in abundance that are so complex.

1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:19.400
 The semi number is so high, they can't possibly form in an environment where there's just random interactions.

1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:23.400
 So, suddenly you can put life on a scale.

1:49:24.400 --> 1:49:27.400
 And then life doesn't exist, actually, in that case.

1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:29.400
 It's just how evolved you are.

1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:43.400
 And you as an object, because you have incredible causal power, you can go and launch rockets or build cars or create drugs.

1:49:44.400 --> 1:49:45.400
 You can do so many things.

1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:51.400
 You can build stuff, build more artifacts that show that you have had causal power.

1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:54.400
 And that causal power is kind of a lineage.

1:49:54.400 --> 1:50:04.400
 And I think that over time, I mean, realizing that physics as a discipline has a number of problems associated with it.

1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:17.400
 Well, me as a chemist is kind of interesting that assembly theory, and I'm really, you know, I want to maintain some credibility in the physics side, but I have to push them because physics is a really good discipline.

1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:21.400
 Physics is about reducing the belief system.

1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:26.400
 But they're down to some things in their belief system, which is kind of really makes me kind of grumpy.

1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:31.400
 Number one is requiring order at the beginning of the universe magically, we don't need that.

1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:33.400
 The second is the second law.

1:50:34.400 --> 1:50:35.400
 Well, we don't actually need that.

1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:38.400
 This is blasphemous.

1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:41.400
 In a minute, I'll recover my career in a second.

1:50:42.400 --> 1:50:47.400
 Although I think the only good thing about being the religious chair means I think there has to be an act of parliament to fire me.

1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:50.400
 Yeah.

1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:55.400
 But you can always go to least Twitter and protest.

1:50:56.400 --> 1:51:01.400
 And I think the third thing is that, so we've got, you know, we've got the order at the beginning.

1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:02.400
 Second law.

1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:06.400
 The second law, and the fact that causation is emergent, right?

1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:08.400
 And that time is emergent.

1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:10.400
 John Carroll just turned off this program.

1:51:11.400 --> 1:51:13.400
 I think he believes that it's emergent.

1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:15.400
 So causation is not emergent.

1:51:15.400 --> 1:51:16.400
 That's clearly incorrect.

1:51:17.400 --> 1:51:19.400
 Because we wouldn't exist otherwise.

1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:22.400
 So physicists have kind of got confused about time.

1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:24.400
 Time is a real thing.

1:51:25.400 --> 1:51:33.400
 Well, I mean, so look, I'm very happy with the current description of the universe as physics give me because I can do a lot of stuff, right?

1:51:34.400 --> 1:51:35.400
 I can go to the moon with Newtonian physics, I think.

1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:40.400
 And I can understand the orbit of Mercury with relativity.

1:51:41.400 --> 1:51:43.400
 And I can build transistors with quantum mechanics, right?

1:51:43.400 --> 1:51:44.400
 And I can do all this stuff.

1:51:45.400 --> 1:51:46.400
 So I'm not saying the physics is wrong.

1:51:47.400 --> 1:51:52.400
 I'm just saying, if we say that time is fundamental, i.e. time is nonnegotiable, there's a global clock.

1:51:53.400 --> 1:52:02.400
 I don't need to, I don't need to require that there's order been magically made in the past because that asymmetry is built into the way the universe is.

1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:12.400
 So if time is fundamental, I mean, you've been referring to this kind of an interesting formulation that is memory.

1:52:13.400 --> 1:52:13.400
 Yeah.

1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:19.400
 So time, time is hard to like put a finger on like what the hell are we talking about?

1:52:19.400 --> 1:52:35.400
 Well, it's just the direction, but memory is a construction, especially when you have like, think about these local pockets of complexity, these nonzero assembly index entities that's being constructed and they remember.

1:52:36.400 --> 1:52:37.400
 Never forget molecules.

1:52:38.400 --> 1:52:40.400
 But remember, the thing is, I invented assembly theory.

1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:42.400
 I'll tell you how I invented it.

1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:48.400
 When I was a kid, I mean, the thing is I keep making fun of myself to my search group.

1:52:49.400 --> 1:52:50.400
 I've only ever had one idea.

1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:53.400
 I keep exploring that idea over the 40 years or so since I had that idea.

1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:56.400
 Well, aren't you the idea that the universe had?

1:52:57.400 --> 1:52:58.400
 So it's very kind of hierarchical.

1:52:59.400 --> 1:53:00.400
 Anyway, go ahead, I'm sorry.

1:53:01.400 --> 1:53:02.400
 That's very poetic.

1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:09.400
 So I think I came up with assembly theory the following idea when I was a kid, I was obsessed about survival kits.

1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:13.400
 What is the minimum stuff I would need to basically replicate my reality?

1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:17.400
 And I love computers and I love technology or what technology was going to become.

1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:21.400
 So I imagined that I would have basically this really big truck full of stuff.

1:53:22.400 --> 1:53:24.400
 And I thought, well, can I delete some of that stuff out?

1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:26.400
 Can I have a blueprint?

1:53:27.400 --> 1:53:31.400
 And then in the end, I kept making this, making it smaller and got to maybe a half a truck into a suitcase.

1:53:32.400 --> 1:53:33.400
 And then I went, okay, screw it.

1:53:34.400 --> 1:53:36.400
 I want to carry my entire technology in my pocket.

1:53:36.400 --> 1:53:41.400
 How do I do it? And I'm not like going to launch into Steve Jobby and, you know, I play.

1:53:42.400 --> 1:53:44.400
 I came up with a matchbox survival kit.

1:53:45.400 --> 1:53:55.400
 In that matchbox survival kit, I would have the minimum stuff that would allow me to interact the environment to build my shelter, to build a fishing rod, to build a water purification system.

1:53:56.400 --> 1:54:03.400
 And it's kind of like, so what did I use in my box to assemble in the environment, to assemble, to assemble, to assemble.

1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:07.400
 And I realized I could make a causal chain in my survival kit.

1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:11.400
 So I guess that's probably why I've been obsessed with assembly theory for so long.

1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:16.400
 And I was just pre configured to find it somewhere.

1:54:17.400 --> 1:54:29.400
 And when I saw it in molecules, I realized that the causal structure that we say emerges and the physics kind of gets really stuck because they're saying that time, you can go backwards in time.

1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:34.400
 I mean, how do we let physicists get away with the notion that we can go back in time and meet ourselves?

1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:41.400
 I mean, that's clearly a very hard thing to allow.

1:54:42.400 --> 1:54:48.400
 Physicists would not let other sciences get away with that kind of heresy, right?

1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:50.400
 So why are physicists allowed to get away with it?

1:54:51.400 --> 1:54:57.400
 So first of all, to push back, to play devil's advocate, you are clearly married to the idea of memory.

1:54:57.400 --> 1:55:12.400
 You see in this, again, from Rick and Morty way, you have these deep dreams of the universe that is writing the story through its memories, through its chemical compounds that are just building on top of each other.

1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:15.400
 And they find useful components that can reuse.

1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:23.400
 And then their reused components create systems that themselves are then reused and all in this way construct things.

1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:31.400
 But when you think of that as memory, it seems like quite sad that you can walk that back.

1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:37.400
 But at the same time, it feels like that memory, you can walk in both directions on that memory in terms of time.

1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:41.400
 You could walk in both directions, but I don't think that that makes any sense.

1:55:41.400 --> 1:55:54.400
 Because the problem that I have with time being reversible is that, I mean, I'm just a, you know, I'm a dumb experimental chemist, right?

1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:57.400
 So I love burning stuff, burning stuff and building stuff.

1:55:58.400 --> 1:56:04.400
 But when I think of reversible phenomena, I imagine in my head, I have to actually manufacture some time.

1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:07.400
 I have to borrow time from the universe to do that.

1:56:07.400 --> 1:56:13.400
 I can't, when anyone says, let's imagine that we can go back in time or reversibility, you can't do that.

1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:16.400
 You can't step out of time. Time is nonnegotiable. It's happening.

1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:23.400
 No, but see, you're assuming that time is fundamental, which most of us do when we go day to day.

1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:28.400
 But it takes a leap of wild imagination to think that time is emergent.

1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:30.400
 No, time is not emergent.

1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:35.400
 Yeah, I mean, this is an argument we can have, but I believe I can come up with an experiment.

1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:38.400
 An experiment that proves that time cannot possibly be emergent.

1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:49.400
 An experiment that shows how assembly theory kind of is the way that the universe produces selection and that selection gives rise to life.

1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:58.400
 And also to say, well, hang on, we could allow ourselves to have a theory that requires us to have these statements to be possible.

1:56:58.400 --> 1:57:08.400
 Like we need to have order in the past or we can have used the past hypothesis, which is order in the past as well.

1:57:09.400 --> 1:57:15.400
 And we have to have an arrow of time. We have to require the entropy increases.

1:57:16.400 --> 1:57:22.400
 And then we can say, look, the universe is completely closed and there's no novelty or that novelty is predetermined.

1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:31.400
 What I'm saying is very, very important that time is fundamental, which means if you think about it, the universe becomes more and more novel each step.

1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:34.400
 It generates as more states and next step than it was before.

1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:36.400
 That means bigger search.

1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:41.400
 So what I'm saying is that the universe wasn't capable of consciousness at day one.

1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:44.400
 Actually, because you didn't have enough states.

1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:47.400
 But today the universe is complex.

1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:53.400
 So it's like, all right, all right, hold on a second. Now we've pissed off the pants like it's two. Okay.

1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:56.400
 No, there's brilliant. Sorry.

1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:05.400
 A part of me is just joking having fun with this thing, but because you're saying a lot of brilliant stuff and I'm trying to slow it down before my brain explodes.

1:58:06.400 --> 1:58:09.400
 Because I want to break apart some of the fascinating things you're saying.

1:58:09.400 --> 1:58:17.400
 So novelty, novelty is increasing in the universe because the number of states is increasing. What do you mean by states?

1:58:18.400 --> 1:58:21.400
 So I think the physicists almost got everything right. I can't fault them at all.

1:58:22.400 --> 1:58:27.400
 I just think there's a little bit of dog. I'm just trying to play devil's advocate. I'm very happy to be entirely wrong on this, right?

1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:29.400
 I'm not right on many things at all.

1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:38.400
 But if I can make less assumptions about the universe with this, then potentially that's a more powerful way of looking at things.

1:58:39.400 --> 1:58:42.400
 If you think of time as fundamental, you can make less assumptions overall.

1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:43.400
 Exactly.

1:58:44.400 --> 1:58:51.400
 If time is fundamental, I don't need to add on a magical second law because the second law comes out of the fact the universe is actually there's more states available.

1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:57.400
 I mean, we might even be able to do weird things like dark energy in the universe might actually just be time, right?

1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:05.400
 Yeah, but then you have to still have to explain why time is fundamental because I can give you one explanation that's simpler than time and say God.

1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:08.400
 You know, just because it's simple doesn't mean it's...

1:59:09.400 --> 1:59:14.400
 But you still have to explain God and you still have to explain time. Why is it fundamental?

1:59:15.400 --> 1:59:18.400
 So let's just say existence is default, which means time is the default.

1:59:19.400 --> 1:59:22.400
 How did you go from the existence to the thought the time is the default?

1:59:23.400 --> 1:59:24.400
 Well, we exist, right?

1:59:24.400 --> 1:59:26.400
 So let's just be very...

1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:28.400
 We're yet to talk about what exists means.

1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:29.400
 All right, let's go all the way back.

1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:30.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:59:31.400 --> 1:59:33.400
 I think it's very poetic and beautiful what you're weaving into this.

1:59:34.400 --> 1:59:46.400
 I don't think this conversation is even about the assembly, which is fascinating and we'll keep mentioning it as something index and this idea that I don't think is necessarily connected to time.

1:59:47.400 --> 1:59:48.400
 Oh, I think it is deeply connected.

1:59:49.400 --> 1:59:50.400
 I can't explain it yet.

1:59:50.400 --> 1:59:58.400
 You don't think everything you've said about assembly theory and assembly index can still be correct even if time is emergent.

1:59:59.400 --> 2:00:01.400
 Yeah, right now, assembly theory appears to work.

2:00:02.400 --> 2:00:07.400
 I appear to be able to measure objects of high assembly in a mass spectrum and look at their abundance and all that's fine, right?

2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:12.400
 If nothing else, it's a nice way of looking at how molecules can compress things.

2:00:14.400 --> 2:00:18.400
 Now, am I saying that a time has to be fundamental or not emergent for assembly theory to work?

2:00:18.400 --> 2:00:25.400
 No, I think I'm saying that the universe, it appears that the universe has many different ways of using time.

2:00:26.400 --> 2:00:27.400
 You could have three different types of time.

2:00:28.400 --> 2:00:30.400
 You could just have time that's the way I would think of it.

2:00:31.400 --> 2:00:33.400
 If you want to hold on to emergent time, I think that's fine.

2:00:34.400 --> 2:00:34.400
 Let's do that for a second.

2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:38.400
 Hold on to emergent time and the universe is just doing its thing.

2:00:39.400 --> 2:00:42.400
 Then assembly time only exists when the universe starts to write memories through bonds.

2:00:42.400 --> 2:00:54.400
 Let's just say there's rocks running around, when the bond happens and selection starts, suddenly the universe is remembering cause and in the past.

2:00:55.400 --> 2:00:56.400
 Those structures will have effects in the future.

2:00:57.400 --> 2:01:01.400
 Suddenly a new type of time emerges at that point which has a direction.

2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:07.400
 I think Sean Carroll at this point might even turn the podcast back on and go, okay, I can deal with that, that's fine.

2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:14.400
 But I'm just basically trying to condense the conversation and say, hey, let's just have time fundamental and see how that screws with people's minds.

2:01:15.400 --> 2:01:16.400
 You're triggering people by saying fundamental.

2:01:17.400 --> 2:01:18.400
 Why not?

2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:21.400
 Let's say, I'm walking through the wall.

2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:27.400
 Why should I grow up in a world where time, I don't go back in time.

2:01:28.400 --> 2:01:29.400
 I don't meet myself in the past.

2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:32.400
 There are no aliens coming from the future.

2:01:32.400 --> 2:01:47.400
 That's like saying we're talking about biology or evolutionary psychology and you're saying, okay, let's just assume that clothing is fundamental.

2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:49.400
 People wearing clothes is fundamental.

2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:51.400
 It's like, no, no, no, wait a minute.

2:01:52.400 --> 2:01:56.400
 I think you're getting in a lot of trouble if you assume time is fundamental.

2:01:57.400 --> 2:01:58.400
 Why?

2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:00.400
 Give me one reason why I'm getting into trouble with time being fundamental.

2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:07.400
 Because you might not understand the origins of this memory that might be deeper.

2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:20.400
 That could be a thing that's explaining the construction of these higher complexities better than just saying it's a search.

2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:31.400
 It's chemicals doing a search for reusable structures that they can then use as bricks to build the house.

2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:33.400
 Okay, so I accept that.

2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:44.400
 So let's go back a second because I wanted to drop the time bomb at this part because I think we can carry on discussing it for many, many, many, many days, many months.

2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:49.400
 But I'm happy to accept that it might be wrong.

2:02:50.400 --> 2:03:01.400
 But what I would like to do is imagine a universe where time is fundamental and time is emergent and ask, let's just then talk about causation because physicists require that causation.

2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:03.400
 So this is where I'm going to go.

2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:07.400
 Causation emerges and it doesn't exist at the micro scale.

2:03:08.400 --> 2:03:12.400
 Well, that clearly is wrong because if causation has to emerge at the macro scale, life cannot emerge.

2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:14.400
 So how does life emerge?

2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:18.400
 Life requires molecules to bump into each other, produce replicators.

2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:20.400
 Those replicators need to produce polymers.

2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:23.400
 There needs to be cause and effect at the molecular level.

2:03:24.400 --> 2:03:28.400
 There needs to be in a girdic, non a girdic to an a girdic transition at some point.

2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:36.400
 And those replicators have material consequence in the universe.

2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:41.400
 Physicists just say, oh, you know what, I'm going to have a bunch of particles in the box.

2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:48.400
 I'm going to think about it in a Newtonian way, in a quantum way, and I'll add on a narrow time so I can label things.

2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:51.400
 And causation will happen magically later.

2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:53.400
 Well, how? Explain causation.

2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:55.400
 And they can't.

2:03:56.400 --> 2:04:04.400
 The only way I can reconcile causation is having a fundamental time because this allows me to have a deterministic universe that creates novelty.

2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:07.400
 And there's so many things to unpack here.

2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:09.400
 But let's go back to the point.

2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:12.400
 You said, can assembly theory work with immersion time?

2:04:13.400 --> 2:04:23.400
 Sure it can, but it doesn't give me a deep satisfaction about how causation and assembly gives rise to these objects that move through time and space.

2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:25.400
 And again, what am I saying?

2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:32.400
 To bring it back, I can say without fear, you know, take this water bottle and look at this water bottle and look at the features on it.

2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:34.400
 There's writing, you've got a load of them.

2:04:35.400 --> 2:04:38.400
 I know that causal structures gave rise to this.

2:04:39.400 --> 2:04:40.400
 In fact, I'm not looking at just one water bottle here.

2:04:41.400 --> 2:04:43.400
 I'm looking at every water bottle that's ever been conceived of by humanity.

2:04:44.400 --> 2:04:46.400
 This here is a special object.

2:04:47.400 --> 2:04:48.400
 In fact, Leibniz knew this.

2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:52.400
 Leibniz, who was at the same time of Newton, he kind of got stuck.

2:04:53.400 --> 2:04:55.400
 I think Leibniz actually invented assembly theory.

2:04:55.400 --> 2:05:01.400
 He gave soul, the soul that you see in objects wasn't the mystical soul, it is assembly.

2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:07.400
 It is a fact there's been a history of objects related and without the object in the past, this object wouldn't exist.

2:05:08.400 --> 2:05:14.400
 There is a lineage and there is conserved structures, causal structures have given rise to those.

2:05:16.400 --> 2:05:17.400
 Fair enough.

2:05:18.400 --> 2:05:22.400
 And you're saying it's just a simpler view with time is fundamental.

2:05:22.400 --> 2:05:25.400
 And it shakes the physicist's cage a bit, right?

2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:27.400
 But I think that...

2:05:28.400 --> 2:05:31.400
 I just enjoy the fact that physicists are in cages.

2:05:32.400 --> 2:05:37.400
 I would say that Leigh Smolin, I don't want to speak for Leigh.

2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:39.400
 I'm talking to Leigh about this.

2:05:40.400 --> 2:05:44.400
 Leigh also is an agreement that time has to be fundamental, but I think he goes further.

2:05:45.400 --> 2:05:48.400
 Even in space, I don't think you can go back to the same place in space.

2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:51.400
 I've been to Austin a few times now, this is my...

2:05:52.400 --> 2:05:53.400
 I think third time I've been to Austin.

2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:55.400
 Is Austin in the same place? No.

2:05:56.400 --> 2:05:57.400
 The solar system is moving through space.

2:05:59.400 --> 2:06:00.400
 I'm not going back in the same space.

2:06:01.400 --> 2:06:02.400
 Locally I am.

2:06:03.400 --> 2:06:05.400
 Every event in the universe is unique.

2:06:07.400 --> 2:06:08.400
 In space.

2:06:09.400 --> 2:06:10.400
 And time.

2:06:11.400 --> 2:06:12.400
 Doesn't mean we can't go back though.

2:06:12.400 --> 2:06:19.400
 I mean, let's just rest this conversation, which was beautiful,

2:06:20.400 --> 2:06:24.400
 with a quote from the Rolling Stones that you can't always get what you want,

2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:26.400
 which is you want time to be fundamental.

2:06:27.400 --> 2:06:30.400
 But if you try, you'll get what you need, which is assembly theory.

2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:33.400
 Okay, let me ask you about...

2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:35.400
 Continue talking about complexity.

2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:42.400
 And to clarify with this beautiful theory of yours that you're developing,

2:06:43.400 --> 2:06:47.400
 and I'm sure we'll continue developing both in the lab and in theory.

2:06:48.400 --> 2:06:51.400
 Yeah, it can't be said enough.

2:06:52.400 --> 2:06:54.400
 Just the ideas you're playing with in your head,

2:06:55.400 --> 2:06:57.400
 and we've been talking about are just beautiful.

2:06:58.400 --> 2:07:00.400
 So if we talk about complexity a little bit more generally,

2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:04.400
 maybe in an admiring romantic way,

2:07:05.400 --> 2:07:07.400
 how does complexity emerge from simple rules?

2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:09.400
 The why, the how?

2:07:10.400 --> 2:07:13.400
 Okay, the nice algorithm of assembly is there.

2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:16.400
 I would say that the problem I have right now is,

2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:18.400
 I mean, you're right, we can, about time as well.

2:07:19.400 --> 2:07:21.400
 The problem is I have this hammer called assembly,

2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:23.400
 and everything I see is a nail.

2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:26.400
 So now let's just apply it to all sorts of things.

2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:29.400
 We take the Bernard instability, the Bernard instability is,

2:07:30.400 --> 2:07:32.400
 you have oil, if you heat up oil,

2:07:33.400 --> 2:07:35.400
 let's say on a frying pan, when you get convection,

2:07:36.400 --> 2:07:37.400
 you get honeycomb patterns.

2:07:38.400 --> 2:07:39.400
 Take the formation of snowflakes, right?

2:07:40.400 --> 2:07:44.400
 Take the emergence of a tropical storm,

2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:46.400
 or the storm on Jupiter.

2:07:47.400 --> 2:07:49.400
 When people say, let's talk about complexity in general,

2:07:50.400 --> 2:07:53.400
 what they're saying is, let's take this collection of objects

2:07:53.400 --> 2:07:55.400
 that are correlated in some way,

2:07:56.400 --> 2:07:59.400
 and try and work out how many moving parts

2:08:00.400 --> 2:08:01.400
 or how this exists.

2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:04.400
 So what people have been doing for a very long time

2:08:05.400 --> 2:08:07.400
 is taking complexity and counting what they've lost,

2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:09.400
 calculating the entropy.

2:08:10.400 --> 2:08:12.400
 And the reason why I'm pushing very hard on assembly

2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:14.400
 is entropy tells you how much you've lost.

2:08:15.400 --> 2:08:17.400
 It doesn't tell you the microstates are gone.

2:08:18.400 --> 2:08:20.400
 But if you embrace the bottom up of the assembly,

2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:22.400
 the bottom up of the assembly, those states,

2:08:23.400 --> 2:08:25.400
 and you then understand the causal chain

2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:27.400
 that gives rise to the emergence.

2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:30.400
 So what I think assembly will help us do

2:08:31.400 --> 2:08:33.400
 is understand weak emergence, at the very least,

2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:38.400
 and maybe allow us to crack open complexity in a new way.

2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:41.400
 And I've been fascinated with complexity theory

2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:43.400
 for many years.

2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:47.400
 As soon as I learned of the Mandelbrot set

2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:51.400
 and I could just type it up in my computer and run it

2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:54.400
 and just show it and see it unfold,

2:08:55.400 --> 2:08:59.400
 it was just this mathematical reality

2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:01.400
 that existed in front of me.

2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:03.400
 I just found incredible.

2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:06.400
 But then I realized that actually we were cheating.

2:09:07.400 --> 2:09:09.400
 We're putting in the boundary conditions all the time.

2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:11.400
 We're putting in information.

2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:15.400
 And so when people talk to me about the complexity of things,

2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:17.400
 I say, but relative what? How do you measure them?

2:09:18.400 --> 2:09:20.400
 So my attempt, my small attempt,

2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:22.400
 naive attempt,

2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:25.400
 because there's many greater minds than mine on the planet right now

2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:27.400
 thinking about this properly

2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:29.400
 and you've had some of them on the podcast, right?

2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:31.400
 They're just absolutely fantastic.

2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:34.400
 But I'm wondering if we might be able to reformat

2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:40.400
 the way we would explore algorithmic complexity using assembly.

2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:44.400
 What's the minimum number of constraints we need

2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:46.400
 in our system for this to unfold?

2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:48.400
 So whether it's like, you know,

2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:51.400
 if you take some particles and put them in a box

2:09:52.400 --> 2:09:53.400
 at a certain box size,

2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:55.400
 you get quasi crystallinity coming out, right?

2:09:56.400 --> 2:09:59.400
 But that quite that emergence, it's not magic.

2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:02.400
 It must come from the boundary conditions you put in.

2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:05.400
 So all I'm saying is a lot of the complexity that we see

2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:09.400
 that we see is a direct read of the constraints we put in,

2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:11.400
 but we just don't understand.

2:10:12.400 --> 2:10:14.400
 So as I said earlier to the poor origin of life chemists,

2:10:15.400 --> 2:10:16.400
 you know, origin of life is a scam.

2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:19.400
 I would say lots of complexity calculation theories,

2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:22.400
 a bit of a scam, because we put the constraints in,

2:10:23.400 --> 2:10:24.400
 but we don't count them correctly.

2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:26.400
 And I'm wondering if...

2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:28.400
 Oh, you're thinking and starting to drop.

2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:30.400
 As assembly theory,

2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:32.400
 assembly index is a way to count the constraints.

2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:34.400
 Yes, that's it. That's all it is.

2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:37.400
 So assembly theory doesn't lower any of the importance

2:10:38.400 --> 2:10:39.400
 of complexity theory,

2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:41.400
 but it allows us to go across domains

2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:43.400
 and start to compare things,

2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:45.400
 compare the complexity of a molecule,

2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:47.400
 of a microprocessor,

2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:49.400
 of the texture of writing,

2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:51.400
 of the music you may compose.

2:10:53.400 --> 2:10:54.400
 You've tweeted, quote,

2:10:55.400 --> 2:10:57.400
 assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood

2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:00.400
 we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom.

2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:03.400
 So we've applied assembly theory to sell your automata

2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:05.400
 in life and chemistry.

2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:08.400
 What does Nietzsche have to do with assembly theory?

2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:11.400
 Oh, that gets me into free will and everything.

2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:13.400
 So let me say that again,

2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:15.400
 assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood

2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:18.400
 we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom.

2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:20.400
 Limited freedom, I suppose,

2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:23.400
 is referring to the fact that there's constraints.

2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:25.400
 Yeah.

2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:27.400
 Or what is radical freedom?

2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:29.400
 What is radical freedom? What is freedom?

2:11:30.400 --> 2:11:32.400
 So Sartre was like believed in absolute freedom

2:11:33.400 --> 2:11:35.400
 and that he could do whatever he wanted

2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:37.400
 in his imagination.

2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:40.400
 And Nietzsche understood that his freedom

2:11:41.400 --> 2:11:42.400
 was somewhat more limited.

2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:45.400
 And it kind of takes me back to this computer game

2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:47.400
 that I played when I was 10.

2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:49.400
 So I think it's called Dragon's Lair.

2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:51.400
 Okay.

2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:53.400
 Do you know Dragon's Lair?

2:11:54.400 --> 2:11:55.400
 I think I know Dragon's Lair.

2:11:55.400 --> 2:11:56.400
 Dragon's Lair has been conned, right?

2:11:57.400 --> 2:11:58.400
 Dragon's Lair, when you play the game,

2:11:59.400 --> 2:12:00.400
 you're lucky that you grew up in a basically

2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:02.400
 procedurally generated world.

2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:04.400
 That was RPG a little bit.

2:12:05.400 --> 2:12:06.400
 No, it's like, is it turn based play?

2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:08.400
 Was it? No.

2:12:09.400 --> 2:12:10.400
 It was a role playing game, but really good graphics

2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:12.400
 and one of the first laser discs.

2:12:13.400 --> 2:12:14.400
 And when you actually flick the stick,

2:12:15.400 --> 2:12:16.400
 it's like it was like a graphical adventure game

2:12:17.400 --> 2:12:18.400
 with animation.

2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:20.400
 And when I played this game, I really,

2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:22.400
 you could get through the game in 12 minutes

2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:24.400
 and you knew what you were doing from not making mistakes.

2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:26.400
 You just play the disc, play the disc, play the disc.

2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:28.400
 So it was just about timing

2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:30.400
 and actually it was a complete fraud

2:12:31.400 --> 2:12:32.400
 because all the animation has been pre recorded on the disc.

2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:34.400
 Yeah.

2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:36.400
 It's like the black mirror, the first interactive

2:12:37.400 --> 2:12:38.400
 where they had all the, you know, several million

2:12:39.400 --> 2:12:41.400
 kind of permutations of the movie

2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:43.400
 that you could select on Netflix.

2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:45.400
 I've forgotten the name of it.

2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:47.400
 So this was exactly that in the laser disc.

2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:50.400
 You basically go left, go right, fight the yoga,

2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:51.400
 slay the dragon.

2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:53.400
 And when you flick the joystick at the right time,

2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:55.400
 it just goes to the next animation to play.

2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:57.400
 It's not really generating it.

2:12:58.400 --> 2:12:59.400
 And I played that game and I knew I was being had.

2:13:01.400 --> 2:13:02.400
 Oh, okay.

2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:04.400
 So to you,

2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:06.400
 dragging there is the first time you realize

2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:08.400
 that free will is an illusion.

2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:10.400
 Yeah.

2:13:11.400 --> 2:13:13.400
 And why does assembly theory

2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:15.400
 give you hints about free will,

2:13:16.400 --> 2:13:17.400
 whether it's an illusion or not?

2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:19.400
 Yeah.

2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:20.400
 I do think I have some will.

2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:22.400
 And I think I am an agent and I think I can interact

2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:24.400
 and I can play around with my,

2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:26.400
 with the models I have of the world

2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:28.400
 and the cost functions, right?

2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:30.400
 And I can hack my own cost functions,

2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:32.400
 which means I have a little bit of free will.

2:13:33.400 --> 2:13:34.400
 But as much as I want to do stuff in the universe,

2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:36.400
 I don't think I could suddenly say,

2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:38.400
 I mean, actually this is ridiculous

2:13:39.400 --> 2:13:40.400
 because now I say I could try and do it, right?

2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:42.400
 It's like I'm suddenly give up everything

2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:44.400
 and become a rapper tomorrow, right?

2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:46.400
 Maybe I could try that,

2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:48.400
 but I don't have sufficient agency

2:13:49.400 --> 2:13:50.400
 to make that necessarily happen.

2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:52.400
 I'm on a trajectory.

2:13:53.400 --> 2:13:54.400
 So when in Dragon's layer,

2:13:55.400 --> 2:13:56.400
 I know that I have some trajectories

2:13:57.400 --> 2:13:58.400
 that I can play with,

2:13:59.400 --> 2:14:00.400
 where Sartre realized he thought

2:14:01.400 --> 2:14:02.400
 that he had no assembly, no memory.

2:14:03.400 --> 2:14:04.400
 He could just leap across and do everything.

2:14:05.400 --> 2:14:06.400
 And Nietzsche said,

2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:08.400
 okay, I realize I don't have full freedom,

2:14:09.400 --> 2:14:10.400
 but I have some freedom.

2:14:11.400 --> 2:14:12.400
 And assembly theory basically says that,

2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:14.400
 it says, if you have these constraints in your past,

2:14:14.400 --> 2:14:15.400
 limit what you were able to do in the future,

2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:18.400
 but you can use them to do amazing things.

2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:20.400
 Let's say I'm a poppy plant

2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:22.400
 and I'm creating some opiates.

2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:25.400
 The opiates are really interesting molecules.

2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:27.400
 I mean, they're obviously great for medicine,

2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:29.400
 great problems in society,

2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:32.400
 but let's imagine we fast forward a billion years.

2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:36.400
 What will the opioids look like in a billion years?

2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:38.400
 Well, we can guess because we can see

2:14:39.400 --> 2:14:40.400
 how those proteins will evolve

2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:42.400
 and we can see how the secondary metabolites

2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:43.400
 will change.

2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:45.400
 But they can't go radical.

2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:47.400
 They can't suddenly become,

2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:49.400
 I don't know, like a molecule that you find

2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:51.400
 in an OLED in a display.

2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:54.400
 They will be limited by their causal chain

2:14:55.400 --> 2:14:56.400
 that produced them.

2:14:57.400 --> 2:14:58.400
 And that's what I'm getting at, saying,

2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:02.400
 we are unpredictably predictable

2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:06.400
 or predictably unpredictable within a constraint

2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:08.400
 on the trajectory we're on.

2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:10.400
 Yeah, so the predictably part is the constraints

2:15:10.400 --> 2:15:11.400
 of the trajectory.

2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:13.400
 And the unpredictable part is the part

2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:15.400
 that you still haven't really clarified

2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:18.400
 the origin of the little bit of freedom.

2:15:19.400 --> 2:15:20.400
 Yeah.

2:15:21.400 --> 2:15:22.400
 So you're just arguing,

2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:24.400
 you're basically saying that radical freedom

2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:26.400
 is impossible.

2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:28.400
 You're really operating in a world of constraints

2:15:29.400 --> 2:15:30.400
 that are constrained by the memory

2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:32.400
 of the trajectory of the chemistry

2:15:33.400 --> 2:15:34.400
 that led to who you are.

2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:37.400
 But even just a tiny bit of freedom,

2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:43.400
 even if everything, if everywhere you are in cages,

2:15:44.400 --> 2:15:47.400
 if you can move around in that cage a little bit,

2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:49.400
 you're free.

2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:51.400
 I agree.

2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:53.400
 And so the question is in assembly theory,

2:15:54.400 --> 2:15:55.400
 if we're thinking about free will,

2:15:56.400 --> 2:15:58.400
 where does the little bit of freedom come from?

2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:00.400
 What is the I?

2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:02.400
 They can decide to be a rapper.

2:16:03.400 --> 2:16:05.400
 What, why, what is that?

2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:06.400
 What is that?

2:16:07.400 --> 2:16:09.400
 That's a cute little trick we've convinced each other of.

2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:12.400
 So we can do fun tricks at parties

2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:14.400
 or is there something fundamental

2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:17.400
 that allows us to feel free, to be free?

2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:19.400
 I think that that's the question

2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:21.400
 that I want to answer.

2:16:22.400 --> 2:16:23.400
 I know you want to answer it.

2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:25.400
 And I think it's so profound.

2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:27.400
 Let me have a go at it.

2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:29.400
 I would say that I don't take the stance of Sam Harris

2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:31.400
 because I think Sam Harris,

2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:33.400
 when he said the way he says it is almost,

2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:34.400
 it's really interesting.

2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:36.400
 I'd love to talk to him about it.

2:16:37.400 --> 2:16:38.400
 Sam Harris almost thinks himself out of existence.

2:16:39.400 --> 2:16:40.400
 Do you know what I mean?

2:16:41.400 --> 2:16:42.400
 Yeah, well, I mean,

2:16:43.400 --> 2:16:44.400
 he has different views on consciousness versus free will.

2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:46.400
 I think he saves himself with consciousness.

2:16:47.400 --> 2:16:49.400
 He thinks himself out of existence with free will.

2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:51.400
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2:16:52.400 --> 2:16:53.400
 So that means there's no point, right?

2:16:54.400 --> 2:16:55.400
 He's a leaf floating on a river.

2:16:56.400 --> 2:16:57.400
 Yeah.

2:16:58.400 --> 2:16:59.400
 I think that he,

2:17:00.400 --> 2:17:01.400
 I don't know, I'd love to ask him

2:17:01.400 --> 2:17:02.400
 whether he really believes that

2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:04.400
 and then we could play some games.

2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:06.400
 No, no, I then would say,

2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:08.400
 I'll get him to play a game of cards with me

2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:10.400
 and I'll work out the conditions on which he says no.

2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:12.400
 And then I'll get him to the conditions he says yes,

2:17:13.400 --> 2:17:14.400
 and then I'll trap him in his logical inconsistency

2:17:15.400 --> 2:17:16.400
 with that argument.

2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:18.400
 Because at some point,

2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:20.400
 at some point when he loses enough money

2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:22.400
 or the prospect of losing enough money,

2:17:23.400 --> 2:17:25.400
 there's a way of basically mapping out a series of,

2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:28.400
 so what will is about,

2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:30.400
 let's not call it free will,

2:17:31.400 --> 2:17:33.400
 what will is about is to have a series of decisions

2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:35.400
 equally weighted in front of you

2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:38.400
 and those decisions aren't necessarily energy minimization.

2:17:39.400 --> 2:17:42.400
 Those decisions are a function of the model

2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:44.400
 you've made in your mind, in your simulation

2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:47.400
 and the way you've interacted in reality

2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:50.400
 and also other interactions

2:17:51.400 --> 2:17:52.400
 you're having with other individuals

2:17:53.400 --> 2:17:54.400
 and happenstance.

2:17:54.400 --> 2:17:59.400
 And I think that there's a little bit of delay in time.

2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:02.400
 So I think what you're able to do is

2:18:03.400 --> 2:18:05.400
 say, well, I'm going to do the counterfactual.

2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:07.400
 I've done all of them

2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:09.400
 and I'm going to go this way

2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:11.400
 and you probably don't know why.

2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:13.400
 I think free will is actually very complex interaction

2:18:14.400 --> 2:18:15.400
 between your unconscious

2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:17.400
 and your conscious brain.

2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:19.400
 And I think the reason why we're arguing about it

2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:21.400
 is so interesting

2:18:21.400 --> 2:18:26.400
 and some people outsource their free will

2:18:27.400 --> 2:18:28.400
 to their unconscious brain

2:18:29.400 --> 2:18:30.400
 and some people try and overthink

2:18:31.400 --> 2:18:32.400
 the free will in the conscious brain.

2:18:33.400 --> 2:18:34.400
 I would say that Sam Harris has realized

2:18:35.400 --> 2:18:36.400
 his conscious brain doesn't have free will

2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:38.400
 but his unconscious brain does.

2:18:39.400 --> 2:18:40.400
 That's my guess, right?

2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:42.400
 And that he can't have access to the unconscious brain.

2:18:43.400 --> 2:18:44.400
 Yeah, and that's kind of annoying.

2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:46.400
 So he's going through meditation

2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:48.400
 come to acceptance with that fact.

2:18:48.400 --> 2:18:50.400
 It's just maybe okay.

2:18:51.400 --> 2:18:52.400
 But I do think that I have

2:18:53.400 --> 2:18:54.400
 the ability to make decisions

2:18:55.400 --> 2:18:56.400
 and I like my decisions.

2:18:57.400 --> 2:18:58.400
 In fact, there's an argument I have

2:18:59.400 --> 2:19:00.400
 with some people that

2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:02.400
 some days I feel I have no free will

2:19:03.400 --> 2:19:04.400
 and it's just an illusion

2:19:05.400 --> 2:19:06.400
 and it makes me more radical if you like.

2:19:07.400 --> 2:19:11.400
 I get to explore more of the state space

2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:13.400
 and I'm going to try and affect the world now.

2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:15.400
 I'm really going to ask the question

2:19:15.400 --> 2:19:17.400
 maybe I dare not ask or dare not

2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:19.400
 or do the thing I dare not do.

2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:21.400
 And that allows me to kind of explore more.

2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:24.400
 It's funny that if you truly accept

2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:26.400
 that there's no free will

2:19:28.400 --> 2:19:29.400
 that is a kind of radical freedom.

2:19:31.400 --> 2:19:34.400
 It's funny, but you're because

2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:36.400
 the little bit of the illusion

2:19:37.400 --> 2:19:38.400
 in under that framework

2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:40.400
 that you have that you can make choices

2:19:40.400 --> 2:19:44.400
 if choice is just an illusion of psychology

2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:46.400
 you can do whatever the hell you want.

2:19:47.400 --> 2:19:48.400
 But we don't, do we?

2:19:49.400 --> 2:19:50.400
 But because you don't truly accept

2:19:51.400 --> 2:19:56.400
 that you think that there's a choice

2:19:57.400 --> 2:19:59.400
 which is why you don't just do whatever

2:20:00.400 --> 2:20:01.400
 the hell you want.

2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:03.400
 You feel like there's some responsibility

2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:05.400
 for making the wrong choice

2:20:06.400 --> 2:20:07.400
 which is why you don't do it.

2:20:07.400 --> 2:20:09.400
 It's just already been made.

2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:11.400
 Then you can go,

2:20:12.400 --> 2:20:13.400
 I don't know what is the most radical thing.

2:20:16.400 --> 2:20:17.400
 I mean, but I don't,

2:20:18.400 --> 2:20:19.400
 I wonder what,

2:20:20.400 --> 2:20:21.400
 what am I preventing myself from doing

2:20:22.400 --> 2:20:23.400
 that I would really want to do?

2:20:24.400 --> 2:20:25.400
 Probably like humor stuff.

2:20:26.400 --> 2:20:27.400
 Like I would,

2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:29.400
 I would love to,

2:20:30.400 --> 2:20:31.400
 if I could like save a game,

2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:33.400
 do the thing,

2:20:34.400 --> 2:20:35.400
 and then reload it later,

2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:36.400
 it probably would be humor.

2:20:37.400 --> 2:20:39.400
 Just to do something like super hilarious.

2:20:42.400 --> 2:20:43.400
 That's super embarrassing.

2:20:44.400 --> 2:20:45.400
 And then just go,

2:20:46.400 --> 2:20:47.400
 I mean, it's basically just fun.

2:20:48.400 --> 2:20:49.400
 I would add more fun to the world.

2:20:50.400 --> 2:20:51.400
 I mean, I sometimes do that.

2:20:52.400 --> 2:20:53.400
 You know, I sometimes,

2:20:54.400 --> 2:20:55.400
 I try and mess up my reality in unusual ways

2:20:56.400 --> 2:20:57.400
 by just doing things because I'm bored,

2:20:58.400 --> 2:20:59.400
 but not bored.

2:21:00.400 --> 2:21:01.400
 I'm not expressing this very well.

2:21:02.400 --> 2:21:03.400
 I think that this is a really interesting problem

2:21:03.400 --> 2:21:04.400
 as the hard sciences don't really understand

2:21:05.400 --> 2:21:06.400
 that they are responsible for because

2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:08.400
 the question about how life emerged

2:21:09.400 --> 2:21:10.400
 and how intelligence emerges

2:21:11.400 --> 2:21:12.400
 and consciousness and free will,

2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:14.400
 they're all ultimately boiling down

2:21:15.400 --> 2:21:16.400
 to some of the same mechanics, I think.

2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:18.400
 My feeling is that they are

2:21:19.400 --> 2:21:20.400
 the same problem again and again and again.

2:21:21.400 --> 2:21:22.400
 The transition from a,

2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:24.400
 you know, a boring world

2:21:25.400 --> 2:21:26.400
 or a world in which there is no selection.

2:21:27.400 --> 2:21:28.400
 So I wonder if free will has something

2:21:29.400 --> 2:21:30.400
 to do with selection and models

2:21:30.400 --> 2:21:32.400
 and also the models you're generating in the brain

2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:34.400
 and also your, the amount of memory,

2:21:35.400 --> 2:21:36.400
 the working memory have available

2:21:37.400 --> 2:21:38.400
 any one time to generate counterfactuals.

2:21:39.400 --> 2:21:40.400
 Oh, that's fascinating.

2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:42.400
 So like the decision making process

2:21:43.400 --> 2:21:44.400
 is a kind of selection

2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:46.400
 and that could be just another,

2:21:47.400 --> 2:21:48.400
 yet another manifestation

2:21:49.400 --> 2:21:50.400
 of the selection mechanism

2:21:51.400 --> 2:21:52.400
 that's pervasive throughout the universe.

2:21:53.400 --> 2:21:54.400
 Okay.

2:21:55.400 --> 2:21:56.400
 That's fascinating to think about.

2:21:57.400 --> 2:21:58.400
 Yeah.

2:21:58.400 --> 2:21:59.400
 And I think that that is just yet

2:22:00.400 --> 2:22:01.400
 another example of selection.

2:22:02.400 --> 2:22:03.400
 Yeah.

2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:05.400
 And in the universe that's intrinsically open,

2:22:06.400 --> 2:22:07.400
 you want to do that because you generate novelty.

2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:09.400
 You mentioned something about

2:22:10.400 --> 2:22:11.400
 do cellular automata exist

2:22:12.400 --> 2:22:13.400
 outside the human mind

2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:15.400
 in our little offline conversation.

2:22:16.400 --> 2:22:17.400
 Why is that an interesting question?

2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:20.400
 So cellular automata, complexity,

2:22:22.400 --> 2:22:23.400
 what's the relationship between

2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:25.400
 complexity in the human mind

2:22:25.400 --> 2:22:27.400
 and trees falling in the forest?

2:22:28.400 --> 2:22:29.400
 Infrastructure.

2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:31.400
 So the CA, so when John Von Neumann

2:22:32.400 --> 2:22:33.400
 and Conway and Feynman were doing CA,

2:22:34.400 --> 2:22:35.400
 they were doing on paper.

2:22:36.400 --> 2:22:37.400
 CA is cellular automata.

2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:39.400
 Yeah, just drawing them on paper.

2:22:40.400 --> 2:22:41.400
 How awesome is that,

2:22:42.400 --> 2:22:43.400
 that they were doing cellular automata on paper?

2:22:44.400 --> 2:22:45.400
 Yeah.

2:22:46.400 --> 2:22:47.400
 And then they were doing a computer

2:22:48.400 --> 2:22:49.400
 that takes forever to print out anything

2:22:50.400 --> 2:22:51.400
 and program.

2:22:52.400 --> 2:22:53.400
 Sure.

2:22:53.400 --> 2:22:54.400
 I don't understand how amazing it is

2:22:55.400 --> 2:22:56.400
 to just play with cellular automata

2:22:57.400 --> 2:22:58.400
 arbitrarily changing the rules

2:22:59.400 --> 2:23:00.400
 as you want to the initial conditions

2:23:01.400 --> 2:23:03.400
 and see the beautiful patterns emerge,

2:23:04.400 --> 2:23:05.400
 sing with fractals, all of that.

2:23:06.400 --> 2:23:07.400
 You've just given me a brilliant idea.

2:23:08.400 --> 2:23:09.400
 I wonder if there's a TikTok account

2:23:10.400 --> 2:23:11.400
 that's just dedicated to putting out CA rules

2:23:12.400 --> 2:23:13.400
 and if it isn't, we should make one.

2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:15.400
 100%.

2:23:16.400 --> 2:23:17.400
 And that will get millions of views.

2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:19.400
 Millions, yes.

2:23:20.400 --> 2:23:21.400
 No, it'll get dozens.

2:23:21.400 --> 2:23:22.400
 So look, I kind of...

2:23:23.400 --> 2:23:24.400
 CA, I love CA's.

2:23:28.400 --> 2:23:29.400
 Yeah, no, I just...

2:23:30.400 --> 2:23:31.400
 We just have to make one.

2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:33.400
 I actually, a few years ago,

2:23:34.400 --> 2:23:35.400
 I made some robots that talked to each other,

2:23:36.400 --> 2:23:38.400
 chemical robots that played the game of Hex,

2:23:39.400 --> 2:23:40.400
 invented by John Nash,

2:23:41.400 --> 2:23:42.400
 by doing chemistry and they communicated

2:23:43.400 --> 2:23:45.400
 by Twitter, which experiments they were doing.

2:23:46.400 --> 2:23:48.400
 And they had a lookup table of experiments.

2:23:48.400 --> 2:23:50.400
 And robot one said, I'm doing experiment 10.

2:23:51.400 --> 2:23:52.400
 The other robot said, OK, I'll do experiment one then.

2:23:53.400 --> 2:23:54.400
 And they communicated...

2:23:55.400 --> 2:23:56.400
 By Twitter and then...

2:23:57.400 --> 2:23:58.400
 Publicly or DMs?

2:23:59.400 --> 2:24:00.400
 Can you maybe quickly explain what the game of Hex is?

2:24:01.400 --> 2:24:03.400
 Yeah, so it's basically a hexagonal board

2:24:04.400 --> 2:24:05.400
 and you try and basically,

2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:07.400
 you color each element on the board at each hexagon

2:24:08.400 --> 2:24:09.400
 and you try and get from one side to the other

2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:11.400
 and the other one tries to block you.

2:24:12.400 --> 2:24:13.400
 How are they connected?

2:24:14.400 --> 2:24:15.400
 So what are the robots?

2:24:15.400 --> 2:24:17.400
 Chemical... Yeah, let's go back.

2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:19.400
 So the two robots.

2:24:20.400 --> 2:24:21.400
 Each robot was doing dichemistry.

2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:23.400
 So making RGB, red, green, blue, red, green, blue, red, green, blue.

2:24:24.400 --> 2:24:25.400
 And they could just choose from experiments

2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:27.400
 to do red, green, blue.

2:24:28.400 --> 2:24:29.400
 Initially, I said to my group,

2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:31.400
 we need to make two chemical robots that play chess.

2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:33.400
 And my group were like, that's too hard.

2:24:34.400 --> 2:24:35.400
 No, go away.

2:24:36.400 --> 2:24:37.400
 But anyway, so we had the robot.

2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:40.400
 By the way, if people listening to this

2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:42.400
 should probably know that Lee Cronin

2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:44.400
 is an amazing group of brilliant people.

2:24:45.400 --> 2:24:46.400
 He's exceptionally well published.

2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:48.400
 He's written a huge number of amazing papers.

2:24:49.400 --> 2:24:50.400
 Whenever he calls himself stupid

2:24:51.400 --> 2:24:52.400
 and is a sign of humility

2:24:53.400 --> 2:24:54.400
 and I deeply respect that and appreciate it.

2:24:55.400 --> 2:24:56.400
 So people listening to this should know

2:24:57.400 --> 2:24:58.400
 this is a world class scientist

2:24:59.400 --> 2:25:00.400
 who doesn't take himself seriously,

2:25:01.400 --> 2:25:02.400
 which I really appreciate and love.

2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:04.400
 Anywho, talking about serious science,

2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:06.400
 we're back to you,

2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:08.400
 you know,

2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:10.400
 you know,

2:25:10.400 --> 2:25:11.400
 serious science.

2:25:12.400 --> 2:25:14.400
 We're back to your group rejecting

2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:17.400
 your idea of chemical robots playing chess

2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:20.400
 via dyes.

2:25:22.400 --> 2:25:23.400
 So you went to a simpler game of hacks.

2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:25.400
 Okay, so what else?

2:25:26.400 --> 2:25:27.400
 The team that did it were brilliant.

2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:30.400
 I think they still have PTSD from doing it

2:25:31.400 --> 2:25:32.400
 because I said this is a workshop.

2:25:33.400 --> 2:25:35.400
 What I'd often do is I have about 60 people in my team.

2:25:36.400 --> 2:25:37.400
 And occasionally before lockdown,

2:25:37.400 --> 2:25:39.400
 I would say, I'm a bit bored.

2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:41.400
 We're going to have a workshop on something.

2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:43.400
 Who wants to come?

2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:45.400
 And then basically about 20 people turn up to my office

2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:47.400
 and I say, we're going to do this mad thing.

2:25:48.400 --> 2:25:49.400
 And then it would just self organize.

2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:51.400
 And some of them would say, no, I'm not doing this.

2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:53.400
 And then you get left with the happy dozen.

2:25:54.400 --> 2:25:55.400
 And what we did is we built this robot

2:25:56.400 --> 2:25:57.400
 and doing dye chemistry is really easy.

2:25:58.400 --> 2:25:59.400
 You can just take two molecules, react them together

2:26:00.400 --> 2:26:01.400
 and change color.

2:26:02.400 --> 2:26:03.400
 And what I wanted to do is have a palette

2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:05.400
 of different molecules.

2:26:05.400 --> 2:26:06.400
 I wanted to have a palette of different colors.

2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:08.400
 So you got two robots.

2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:10.400
 And I went, wouldn't it be cool if the robots

2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:13.400
 basically shared the same list of reactions to do.

2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:15.400
 And they said, oh, and because of,

2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:18.400
 then you could do a kind of multi core chemistry.

2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:20.400
 Like they weren't, so you could have two chemical reactions

2:26:21.400 --> 2:26:22.400
 going on at once.

2:26:23.400 --> 2:26:24.400
 And they could basically outsource the problem.

2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:26.400
 But they're sharing the same tape.

2:26:27.400 --> 2:26:28.400
 Exactly.

2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:30.400
 So robot one would say, I'm going to do experiment one

2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:32.400
 and the other robot says, I'll do experiment 100.

2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:34.400
 But I wanted to make it. That's brilliant, by the way.

2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:36.400
 That is genius.

2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:38.400
 Well, I wanted to make it groovier.

2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:40.400
 And I said, look, let's have them competing

2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:42.400
 to make, so playing a game of Hex.

2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:45.400
 And so when the robot does an experiment

2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:47.400
 and the more blue the dye,

2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:50.400
 the more it gets the higher chance it gets

2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:52.400
 to make the move it wants on the Hex board.

2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:54.400
 So if it gets a red color,

2:26:55.400 --> 2:26:56.400
 it gets down weighted in the other robot.

2:26:57.400 --> 2:26:58.400
 And so what the robots could do

2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:00.400
 is they play each player move

2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:01.400
 and because the fitness function

2:27:02.400 --> 2:27:03.400
 or the optimization function

2:27:04.400 --> 2:27:05.400
 was to make the color blue,

2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:08.400
 they started to invent reactions

2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:10.400
 we weren't on the list.

2:27:11.400 --> 2:27:12.400
 And they did this by not cleaning

2:27:13.400 --> 2:27:14.400
 because we made cleaning optional.

2:27:15.400 --> 2:27:16.400
 So when one robot realized

2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:18.400
 if it didn't clean its pipes,

2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:20.400
 it could get blue more quickly.

2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:22.400
 And the other robot realized that,

2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:24.400
 so it was like getting dirty as well.

2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:26.400
 I didn't tell the consequences of super intelligence.

2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:28.400
 Okay.

2:27:28.400 --> 2:27:29.400
 And we were communicating through Twitter though.

2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:31.400
 They were doing it through Twitter

2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:33.400
 and Twitter bland them a couple of times.

2:27:34.400 --> 2:27:35.400
 I said, come on, you've got a couple of robots

2:27:36.400 --> 2:27:37.400
 doing chemistry. It's really cool.

2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:39.400
 Stop banning them.

2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:41.400
 But in the end they had,

2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:43.400
 we had to take them off Twitter

2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:45.400
 and they just communicated via a server

2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:47.400
 because it was just, there were people saying,

2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:49.400
 you can still find at cronin lab one

2:27:50.400 --> 2:27:51.400
 and cronin lab two on Twitter.

2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:53.400
 And it was like make move, wait,

2:27:54.400 --> 2:27:55.400
 you know, mix A and B, wait 10 seconds,

2:27:55.400 --> 2:27:57.400
 they were compelling that you would have

2:27:58.400 --> 2:27:59.400
 a chemical entity

2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:01.400
 that's communicating with the world.

2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:03.400
 That was one of the things I want to do

2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:05.400
 in my origin of life reaction, right,

2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:07.400
 is basically have a,

2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:09.400
 have a reactor

2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:11.400
 that's basically just randomly enumerating

2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:13.400
 through chemical space and have some kind of cycle

2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:16.400
 and then read out what the molecules

2:28:17.400 --> 2:28:18.400
 reading out using a mass spectrometer

2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:20.400
 and then convert that to text

2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:22.400
 and publish it on Twitter

2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:24.400
 and then wait until it says I'm alive.

2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:26.400
 I reckon that would get,

2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:28.400
 I reckon that that Twitter account

2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:30.400
 will get a lot of followers.

2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:32.400
 And I'm still trying to convince my group

2:28:33.400 --> 2:28:34.400
 that we should just make an origin of life

2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:36.400
 Twitter account where it's going

2:28:37.400 --> 2:28:38.400
 and it's like, hello, testing.

2:28:39.400 --> 2:28:40.400
 I'm here.

2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:42.400
 Well, I'll share it. I like it.

2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:44.400
 I particularly enjoy this idea

2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:47.400
 of a non human entity communicating

2:28:48.400 --> 2:28:49.400
 with the world via a human designed

2:28:49.400 --> 2:28:51.400
 quite a, quite a beautiful idea.

2:28:55.400 --> 2:28:56.400
 How we were talking about

2:28:58.400 --> 2:28:59.400
 CAs existing outside the human mind.

2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:01.400
 Yeah. So I really admire Stephen Wolfram.

2:29:02.400 --> 2:29:03.400
 I think he was a genius, clearly

2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:05.400
 a genius and trapped in is actually

2:29:06.400 --> 2:29:07.400
 is like a problem with being so smart

2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:09.400
 if you get trapped in your own,

2:29:10.400 --> 2:29:11.400
 you know, mind, right?

2:29:12.400 --> 2:29:13.400
 And I've, I tried to actually,

2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:15.400
 I tried to convince Stephen that

2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:17.400
 Sembry theory wasn't nonsense.

2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:18.400
 I was a little bit sad by that.

2:29:19.400 --> 2:29:20.400
 So nonsense applied, even if we applied

2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:22.400
 to the simple construct of a

2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:24.400
 one dimensional cellular automata, for example.

2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:26.400
 Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, actually,

2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:28.400
 maybe I'm doing myself a bit too down.

2:29:29.400 --> 2:29:30.400
 It was just as a theory was coming through

2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:32.400
 and I didn't really know how to explain it.

2:29:33.400 --> 2:29:34.400
 But we are going to use assembly

2:29:35.400 --> 2:29:36.400
 theory and CAs instead of automata.

2:29:37.400 --> 2:29:38.400
 But I wanted to,

2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:40.400
 what I was really curious about

2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:42.400
 is why people are Marvel.

2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:44.400
 I mean, you marvel at CAs and they're

2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:46.400
 like, you know, I said, well, hang on,

2:29:47.400 --> 2:29:48.400
 that complexity is baked in because

2:29:49.400 --> 2:29:50.400
 if you play the game of life in a CA,

2:29:51.400 --> 2:29:52.400
 you have to run it on a computer.

2:29:53.400 --> 2:29:54.400
 You have to have a,

2:29:55.400 --> 2:29:56.400
 you have to do a number of operations

2:29:57.400 --> 2:29:58.400
 and put in the boundary conditions.

2:29:59.400 --> 2:30:00.400
 So is it surprising that you get this

2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:02.400
 structure out?

2:30:03.400 --> 2:30:04.400
 Is it manufactured by the boundary

2:30:05.400 --> 2:30:06.400
 conditions?

2:30:07.400 --> 2:30:08.400
 And it is interesting because I think

2:30:09.400 --> 2:30:10.400
 a cellular automata running them

2:30:11.400 --> 2:30:12.400
 is teaching me something about

2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:13.400
 what real numbers are and aren't.

2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:15.400
 And I haven't quite got there yet.

2:30:16.400 --> 2:30:17.400
 I was playing on the aeroplane coming

2:30:18.400 --> 2:30:19.400
 over and just realized I have no idea

2:30:20.400 --> 2:30:21.400
 what real numbers are really.

2:30:22.400 --> 2:30:23.400
 And I was like, well, I do actually

2:30:24.400 --> 2:30:25.400
 have some notion of what real numbers

2:30:26.400 --> 2:30:27.400
 are.

2:30:28.400 --> 2:30:29.400
 And I think thinking about real numbers

2:30:30.400 --> 2:30:31.400
 as functions rather than numbers

2:30:32.400 --> 2:30:33.400
 is more appropriate.

2:30:34.400 --> 2:30:35.400
 And then if you then apply that to CAs

2:30:36.400 --> 2:30:37.400
 and you're saying, well, actually,

2:30:38.400 --> 2:30:39.400
 why am I seeing this complexity

2:30:39.400 --> 2:30:40.400
 here?

2:30:41.400 --> 2:30:42.400
 Is it, you know, is it,

2:30:43.400 --> 2:30:44.400
 is it, you've got this deterministic

2:30:45.400 --> 2:30:46.400
 system and yet you get this incredible

2:30:47.400 --> 2:30:48.400
 structure coming out?

2:30:49.400 --> 2:30:50.400
 Well, isn't that what you'd get with

2:30:51.400 --> 2:30:52.400
 any real number as you,

2:30:53.400 --> 2:30:54.400
 as you apply it as a function

2:30:55.400 --> 2:30:56.400
 and you're trying to read it out to

2:30:57.400 --> 2:30:58.400
 an arbitrary position?

2:30:59.400 --> 2:31:00.400
 And I wonder if CAs are just helping

2:31:01.400 --> 2:31:02.400
 me, well, my misunderstanding is CAs

2:31:03.400 --> 2:31:04.400
 might be helping me understand them

2:31:05.400 --> 2:31:06.400
 in terms of real numbers.

2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:10.400
 But the devil's in the function.

2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:12.400
 Like, which is the function that's

2:31:13.400 --> 2:31:15.400
 generating your real number?

2:31:16.400 --> 2:31:19.400
 Like, it seems like it's very important

2:31:20.400 --> 2:31:21.400
 the specific algorithm that function

2:31:22.400 --> 2:31:23.400
 because some lead to something

2:31:24.400 --> 2:31:25.400
 super trivial, some lead to something

2:31:26.400 --> 2:31:27.400
 that's all chaotic and some lead to

2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:30.400
 things that are just walk that

2:31:31.400 --> 2:31:32.400
 fine line of complexity

2:31:33.400 --> 2:31:34.400
 and structure.

2:31:34.400 --> 2:31:35.400
 I think we agree.

2:31:36.400 --> 2:31:37.400
 So let's take it back a second.

2:31:38.400 --> 2:31:39.400
 So take the logistic map or something,

2:31:40.400 --> 2:31:41.400
 logistic equation where you have this

2:31:42.400 --> 2:31:43.400
 equation, which is,

2:31:44.400 --> 2:31:45.400
 you don't, you don't know what's going

2:31:46.400 --> 2:31:47.400
 to happen to M plus one, but once

2:31:48.400 --> 2:31:49.400
 you've done M plus one, you know,

2:31:50.400 --> 2:31:51.400
 full time, you can't predict it.

2:31:52.400 --> 2:31:53.400
 For me, CAs and logistic equation

2:31:54.400 --> 2:31:55.400
 feel similar.

2:31:56.400 --> 2:31:57.400
 And I think what's incredibly

2:31:58.400 --> 2:31:59.400
 interesting and I share your

2:32:01.400 --> 2:32:02.400
 kind of wonder at running a CA,

2:32:02.400 --> 2:32:04.400
 but also I'm saying, well, what is it

2:32:05.400 --> 2:32:06.400
 about the boundary conditions and the

2:32:07.400 --> 2:32:08.400
 way I'm running that calculation?

2:32:09.400 --> 2:32:10.400
 So in my group, with my team, we

2:32:11.400 --> 2:32:12.400
 actually made a chemical CA.

2:32:13.400 --> 2:32:14.400
 We made Game of Life.

2:32:15.400 --> 2:32:16.400
 We actually made a physical grid.

2:32:17.400 --> 2:32:18.400
 I haven't been able to publish this

2:32:19.400 --> 2:32:20.400
 paper. It's been trapped in purgatory

2:32:21.400 --> 2:32:22.400
 for a long time.

2:32:23.400 --> 2:32:24.400
 You wrote up a paper how to do a

2:32:25.400 --> 2:32:26.400
 chemical formulation of the game of

2:32:27.400 --> 2:32:28.400
 life.

2:32:29.400 --> 2:32:30.400
 We made a chemical computer and

2:32:30.400 --> 2:32:31.400
 we got on and off.

2:32:32.400 --> 2:32:33.400
 We have little stirrer bars and we

2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:35.400
 have little gates and we actually

2:32:36.400 --> 2:32:37.400
 played Conway's Game of Life in

2:32:38.400 --> 2:32:39.400
 there and we got structures in that.

2:32:40.400 --> 2:32:41.400
 We got structures in that game

2:32:42.400 --> 2:32:43.400
 from the chemistry that you wouldn't

2:32:44.400 --> 2:32:45.400
 expect from the actual CA.

2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:47.400
 So that's kind of cool in that.

2:32:48.400 --> 2:32:49.400
 Because they're they're interacting

2:32:50.400 --> 2:32:51.400
 outside of the cell somewhere.

2:32:52.400 --> 2:32:53.400
 So what's happening is you're getting

2:32:54.400 --> 2:32:55.400
 annoyed. So the thing is that you've

2:32:56.400 --> 2:32:57.400
 got this BZ reaction and it gives

2:32:57.400 --> 2:32:59.400
 you also a wake and those wakes

2:33:00.400 --> 2:33:01.400
 constructively interfere or in

2:33:02.400 --> 2:33:03.400
 such a non trivial way that

2:33:05.400 --> 2:33:06.400
 that's non deterministic.

2:33:07.400 --> 2:33:08.400
 And the non determinism in

2:33:09.400 --> 2:33:11.400
 the system gives very rich

2:33:12.400 --> 2:33:13.400
 dynamics. And I was wondering if I

2:33:14.400 --> 2:33:15.400
 could physically make a chemical

2:33:16.400 --> 2:33:17.400
 computer with this CA that

2:33:18.400 --> 2:33:19.400
 gives me something different.

2:33:20.400 --> 2:33:22.400
 I can't get in a silicon

2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:25.400
 representation of a CA where

2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:26.400
 all the states are clean because

2:33:27.400 --> 2:33:28.400
 you don't have the noise trailing

2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:30.400
 into the next round.

2:33:31.400 --> 2:33:32.400
 You just have the state.

2:33:33.400 --> 2:33:34.400
 So the paper in particular.

2:33:35.400 --> 2:33:36.400
 So that's just a beautiful idea to

2:33:37.400 --> 2:33:38.400
 use a chemical computer to construct

2:33:39.400 --> 2:33:40.400
 the cellular automa and the famous

2:33:41.400 --> 2:33:42.400
 one of Game of Life.

2:33:43.400 --> 2:33:44.400
 But it's also interesting.

2:33:45.400 --> 2:33:46.400
 It's a really interesting scientific

2:33:47.400 --> 2:33:48.400
 question of whether some kind of

2:33:49.400 --> 2:33:50.400
 random perturbations or some source

2:33:51.400 --> 2:33:52.400
 of randomness can

2:33:52.400 --> 2:33:53.400
 have a

2:33:54.400 --> 2:33:55.400
 significant

2:33:56.400 --> 2:33:58.400
 constructive effect on the

2:33:59.400 --> 2:34:00.400
 complexity of the system.

2:34:01.400 --> 2:34:02.400
 And indeed, I mean, whether it's

2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:04.400
 random or just non deterministic

2:34:05.400 --> 2:34:06.400
 and can we bake in that non

2:34:07.400 --> 2:34:08.400
 determinism at the beginning, you

2:34:09.400 --> 2:34:10.400
 know, I wonder what what is the

2:34:11.400 --> 2:34:12.400
 I'm trying to think about what is

2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:14.400
 the encoding space encoding space

2:34:15.400 --> 2:34:16.400
 is pretty big. We have

2:34:17.400 --> 2:34:18.400
 49 star so 49 cells

2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:20.400
 49 chem bits

2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:21.400
 are all connected to one another

2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:23.400
 and like an analog computer

2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:25.400
 but being read out discreetly as

2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:27.400
 the BZ reaction.

2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:29.400
 So just to say the BZ reaction is

2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:31.400
 a chemical oscillator.

2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:33.400
 And what happened in each cell is

2:34:34.400 --> 2:34:35.400
 it goes between red and blue.

2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:37.400
 So two Russians discovered it.

2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:39.400
 I think Beluzov first proposed it

2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:41.400
 and everyone said you're crazy.

2:34:42.400 --> 2:34:43.400
 It breaks a second law and

2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:45.400
 Zabasinski said no, it doesn't

2:34:46.400 --> 2:34:47.400
 break the second law.

2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:49.400
 There's a lot of chemistry hidden

2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:51.400
 in the Russian literature actually

2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:53.400
 because Russians just wrote it

2:34:54.400 --> 2:34:55.400
 in Russian. They didn't publish it

2:34:56.400 --> 2:34:57.400
 in English speaking journals.

2:34:58.400 --> 2:34:59.400
 It's sad and it's great

2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:01.400
 that it's there.

2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:03.400
 It's not lost. I'm sure we will

2:35:04.400 --> 2:35:05.400
 find a way of translating it

2:35:06.400 --> 2:35:07.400
 properly.

2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:09.400
 Silver lining slash greater sadness

2:35:10.400 --> 2:35:11.400
 of all of this is there's probably

2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:13.400
 ideas in English speaking.

2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:15.400
 Like there's ideas in certain

2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:16.400
 languages that if

2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:18.400
 discovered by other disciplines

2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:20.400
 would crack open some of the

2:35:21.400 --> 2:35:22.400
 biggest mysteries in those

2:35:22.400 --> 2:35:23.400
 disciplines.

2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:25.400
 Like computer science for example

2:35:26.400 --> 2:35:28.400
 is trying to solve

2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:30.400
 problems like nobody else has

2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:32.400
 ever tried to solve problems.

2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:34.400
 As if it's not already been all

2:35:35.400 --> 2:35:36.400
 addressed in cognitive science

2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:38.400
 and psychology and mathematics

2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:40.400
 and physics and just

2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:42.400
 whatever you want to economics

2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:44.400
 but if you look into that literature

2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:46.400
 you may be able to discover some

2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:48.400
 beautiful ideas.

2:35:49.400 --> 2:35:50.400
 Obviously Russian is

2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:52.400
 an interesting case of that

2:35:53.400 --> 2:35:54.400
 because there's a loss in

2:35:55.400 --> 2:35:56.400
 translation but you said there's

2:35:57.400 --> 2:35:58.400
 a source of fuel, a source of

2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:00.400
 energy.

2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:02.400
 Yeah, so the BZ reaction you

2:36:03.400 --> 2:36:04.400
 have an acid in there called

2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:06.400
 melonic acid and what happens

2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:08.400
 is it's basically like a battery

2:36:09.400 --> 2:36:10.400
 that powers it and it loses CO2

2:36:10.400 --> 2:36:11.400
 so it's just a chemical reaction.

2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:13.400
 What that means we have to do is

2:36:14.400 --> 2:36:15.400
 continuously feed or we just

2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:17.400
 keep the BZ reaction going in a

2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:19.400
 long enough time so it's

2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:21.400
 like it's reversible in time.

2:36:23.400 --> 2:36:24.400
 But only like.

2:36:25.400 --> 2:36:26.400
 But it's fascinating.

2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:28.400
 I mean the team that did it I'm

2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:30.400
 really proud of their persistence.

2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:32.400
 We made a chemical computer.

2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:34.400
 It can solve little problems.

2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:36.400
 It can solve travelling salesman

2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:38.400
 problems actually.

2:36:38.400 --> 2:36:39.400
 It's not any faster than the

2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:41.400
 computer.

2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:43.400
 Is there something you could do?

2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:45.400
 Maybe.

2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:47.400
 I think we can come up with a way

2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:49.400
 of solving problems.

2:36:50.400 --> 2:36:51.400
 Also really complex hard ones

2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:54.400
 because it's an analog computer

2:36:55.400 --> 2:36:56.400
 and we can

2:36:57.400 --> 2:36:58.400
 it can energy minimise really

2:36:59.400 --> 2:37:00.400
 quickly.

2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:02.400
 It doesn't have to basically go

2:37:03.400 --> 2:37:04.400
 through every element in the matrix

2:37:05.400 --> 2:37:06.400
 like flip it.

2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:07.400
 We can do Monte Carlo

2:37:08.400 --> 2:37:09.400
 by just shaking the box.

2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:11.400
 It's literally a box shaker.

2:37:12.400 --> 2:37:13.400
 You don't actually have to encode

2:37:14.400 --> 2:37:15.400
 the shaking of the box in a

2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:17.400
 silicon memory and then just shuffle

2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:19.400
 everything around.

2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:21.400
 It's analog, it's natural so

2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:23.400
 it's an organic computer.

2:37:24.400 --> 2:37:25.400
 So I was playing around with this

2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:27.400
 and I was kind of annoying some of

2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:29.400
 my colleagues and wondering if we

2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:31.400
 could get to chemical supremacy

2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:33.400
 like quantum supremacy.

2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:35.400
 How big the grid has to be

2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:37.400
 so we can actually start to solve

2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:39.400
 problems faster than a silicon

2:37:40.400 --> 2:37:41.400
 computer.

2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:43.400
 But I'm not willing to state how

2:37:44.400 --> 2:37:45.400
 that is yet because I'm probably

2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:47.400
 wrong.

2:37:48.400 --> 2:37:49.400
 It's not any top secret thing.

2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:51.400
 I think I can make a chemical

2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:53.400
 computer that can solve

2:37:54.400 --> 2:37:55.400
 optimization problems faster than

2:37:56.400 --> 2:37:57.400
 the silicon computer.

2:37:58.400 --> 2:37:59.400
 That's fascinating.

2:38:00.400 --> 2:38:01.400
 But then you're unsure how big

2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:02.400
 exactly a big box is hard to shake

2:38:03.400 --> 2:38:04.400
 and basically a bit sloppy.

2:38:05.400 --> 2:38:06.400
 Did we answer the question

2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:08.400
 about do cellular time

2:38:09.400 --> 2:38:10.400
 exist outside the mind?

2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:12.400
 We didn't, but I would

2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:14.400
 posit that they don't.

2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:16.400
 But I think minds can...

2:38:17.400 --> 2:38:18.400
 Well, so the mind is fundamental.

2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:20.400
 What's the...

2:38:21.400 --> 2:38:22.400
 Well, I mean, sorry, let's go

2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:24.400
 back. So as a physical phenomena,

2:38:25.400 --> 2:38:26.400
 do CAs exist in physical reality?

2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:28.400
 Right?

2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:30.400
 I would say they probably don't

2:38:30.400 --> 2:38:31.400
 exist outside the human mind,

2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:33.400
 but now we've constructed them.

2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:34.400
 They exist in computer memories.

2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:35.400
 They exist in my lab.

2:38:36.400 --> 2:38:37.400
 They exist on paper.

2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:39.400
 So they emerge from the human mind.

2:38:40.400 --> 2:38:41.400
 I'm just interested in because

2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:43.400
 Stephen Wolfram likes CAs.

2:38:44.400 --> 2:38:45.400
 A lot of people like CAs and likes

2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:47.400
 to think of them as minimal

2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:49.400
 computational elements.

2:38:50.400 --> 2:38:51.400
 I'm just saying, well, do they

2:38:52.400 --> 2:38:53.400
 exist in reality or are they a

2:38:54.400 --> 2:38:55.400
 representation of a simple machine

2:38:56.400 --> 2:38:57.400
 that's just very elegant to

2:38:58.400 --> 2:38:59.400
 implement?

2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:00.400
 I mean, it's...

2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:02.400
 There's initial conditions.

2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:04.400
 There's a memory in the system.

2:39:05.400 --> 2:39:06.400
 There are simple rules that

2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:08.400
 dictate the evolution of the system.

2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:10.400
 So what exists?

2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:12.400
 The idea, the rules, the...

2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:14.400
 Yeah, people are using CAs as

2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:16.400
 models for things in reality

2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:18.400
 to say, hey, look,

2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:20.400
 you can do this thing in a CAs.

2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:23.400
 When I see this, I'm saying,

2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:25.400
 oh, that's cool, but what does

2:39:26.400 --> 2:39:27.400
 that tell me about reality?

2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:28.400
 Oh, I see.

2:39:29.400 --> 2:39:30.400
 It's a mathematical object.

2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:31.400
 So for people who don't know

2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:33.400
 cellular automata, there's

2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:35.400
 usually a grid where there's

2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:37.400
 one dimensional, two dimensional

2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:39.400
 or three dimensional and it evolves

2:39:40.400 --> 2:39:41.400
 by simple local rules like you die

2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:43.400
 or are born if the neighbors

2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:45.400
 are alive or dead.

2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:47.400
 It turns out if you have

2:39:51.400 --> 2:39:52.400
 with certain kinds of initial

2:39:53.400 --> 2:39:54.400
 conditions and with certain kinds

2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:56.400
 that create arbitrarily complex

2:39:57.400 --> 2:39:58.400
 and beautiful systems.

2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:00.400
 And to me, whether

2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:03.400
 drugs are involved or not,

2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:05.400
 I can sit back for hours

2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:08.400
 and enjoy the mystery

2:40:09.400 --> 2:40:10.400
 of it, how such complexity

2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:12.400
 can emerge.

2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:14.400
 It gives me almost like...

2:40:15.400 --> 2:40:16.400
 People talk about religious

2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:18.400
 experiences.

2:40:19.400 --> 2:40:20.400
 It gives me a sense that you

2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:22.400
 get to have a glimpse

2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:23.400
 at the

2:40:24.400 --> 2:40:25.400
 origin of this whole thing.

2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:27.400
 Whatever is creating

2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:29.400
 this complexity

2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:31.400
 from such simplicity

2:40:33.400 --> 2:40:34.400
 is the very thing that brought

2:40:35.400 --> 2:40:36.400
 my mind to life.

2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:38.400
 That's me, the human,

2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:41.400
 our human civilization.

2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:43.400
 And yes,

2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:46.400
 those constructs are pretty trivial.

2:40:48.400 --> 2:40:49.400
 I mean, that's part of their magic

2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:51.400
 is even in this trivial

2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:53.400
 framework,

2:40:54.400 --> 2:40:55.400
 you could see the emergence

2:40:56.400 --> 2:40:57.400
 or especially in this trivial

2:40:58.400 --> 2:40:59.400
 framework, you could see the

2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:01.400
 emergence of complexity from

2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:03.400
 simplicity.

2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:05.400
 I guess what Lee, you're saying

2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:07.400
 is that this is not,

2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:10.400
 this is highly unlike

2:41:11.400 --> 2:41:12.400
 systems we see in the physical

2:41:13.400 --> 2:41:14.400
 world, even though they probably

2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:16.400
 carry some of the same magic

2:41:16.400 --> 2:41:18.400
 mechanistically.

2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:20.400
 I mean, I'm saying that the

2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:22.400
 operating system that a CA has

2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:24.400
 to exist on is quite complex.

2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:26.400
 Right.

2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:28.400
 And so I wonder if you're getting

2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:30.400
 the complexity out of the CA from

2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:32.400
 the boundary conditions, the

2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:34.400
 operating system, the underlying

2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:36.400
 digital computer.

2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:38.400
 Oh, wow.

2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:40.400
 Those are some strong words

2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:42.400
 against CA's then.

2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:44.400
 I mean, I'm in love with CA's

2:41:44.400 --> 2:41:45.400
 and I think they are incredible

2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:47.400
 to get to that richness.

2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:49.400
 You have to iterate billions of

2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:51.400
 times and you need a display

2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:53.400
 and you need a math co processor

2:41:54.400 --> 2:41:55.400
 and you need a von Neumann

2:41:56.400 --> 2:41:57.400
 machine based on a Turing

2:41:58.400 --> 2:41:59.400
 machine with digital error

2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:01.400
 correction and states.

2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:03.400
 Wow.

2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:05.400
 To think that for the simplicity

2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:07.400
 of a grid, you're basically

2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:09.400
 saying a grid is not simple.

2:42:10.400 --> 2:42:11.400
 Yeah.

2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:13.400
 To bring a grid to life.

2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:15.400
 Yeah.

2:42:16.400 --> 2:42:17.400
 Then what is simple?

2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:19.400
 That's all I wanted to say.

2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:21.400
 I agree with you with a wonder of

2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:23.400
 CA's, I just think, but remember

2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:25.400
 we take so much for granted what

2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:27.400
 the CA is resting on because von

2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:29.400
 Neumann and Feynman weren't

2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:31.400
 showing weren't seeing these

2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:33.400
 elaborate structures.

2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:35.400
 They could not get that far.

2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:37.400
 Yeah, but that's the limitation

2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:39.400
 of their mind.

2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:40.400
 The question is whether the

2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:42.400
 essential elements of the cellular

2:42:43.400 --> 2:42:45.400
 automata is

2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:48.400
 present without

2:42:49.400 --> 2:42:50.400
 all the complexities required to

2:42:51.400 --> 2:42:52.400
 build a computer.

2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:54.400
 The reason I find it incredible

2:42:55.400 --> 2:42:57.400
 is that my intuition is yes.

2:42:58.400 --> 2:42:59.400
 It might look different.

2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:01.400
 There might not be a grid

2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:04.400
 like structure, but

2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:06.400
 local interactions operating under

2:43:06.400 --> 2:43:08.400
 simple rules and resulting in

2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:10.400
 multi hierarchical complex

2:43:11.400 --> 2:43:12.400
 structures feels like a thing

2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:14.400
 that doesn't require a computer.

2:43:15.400 --> 2:43:16.400
 I agree.

2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:18.400
 But coming back to von Neumann

2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:20.400
 and Feynman and Wolfram,

2:43:21.400 --> 2:43:22.400
 their minds, the non trivial

2:43:23.400 --> 2:43:24.400
 minds to create those architectures

2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:26.400
 and do it and to put on those

2:43:27.400 --> 2:43:28.400
 state transitions.

2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:30.400
 And I think that's something that's

2:43:31.400 --> 2:43:32.400
 really incredibly interesting

2:43:33.400 --> 2:43:34.400
 that

2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:36.400
 is understanding how the human

2:43:37.400 --> 2:43:38.400
 mind builds those state transition

2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:40.400
 machines.

2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:42.400
 I could see how deeply in love with

2:43:43.400 --> 2:43:44.400
 the idea of memory you are.

2:43:45.400 --> 2:43:46.400
 So it's like how much of

2:43:47.400 --> 2:43:48.400
 E equals MC squared

2:43:50.400 --> 2:43:52.400
 is more than an equation.

2:43:53.400 --> 2:43:55.400
 It has Albert Einstein in it.

2:43:56.400 --> 2:43:57.400
 Like you're saying like you can't

2:43:58.400 --> 2:43:59.400
 just say this is a

2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:02.400
 like the equations of physics

2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:03.400
 are a really good

2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:05.400
 simple capture

2:44:06.400 --> 2:44:07.400
 of a physical phenomena.

2:44:08.400 --> 2:44:09.400
 It is also has the member

2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:11.400
 that equation has the memory of

2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:13.400
 the humans.

2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:15.400
 Absolutely.

2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:17.400
 Absolutely. Yeah.

2:44:18.400 --> 2:44:19.400
 But I don't I don't know if

2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:21.400
 you're implying this.

2:44:22.400 --> 2:44:23.400
 I don't that's a beautiful

2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:25.400
 idea, but I don't know if

2:44:26.400 --> 2:44:27.400
 I'm comfortable with that

2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:29.400
 sort of diminishing the power

2:44:29.400 --> 2:44:30.400
 of that equation.

2:44:31.400 --> 2:44:32.400
 No, no, it enhances it on the

2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:33.400
 shoulders.

2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:35.400
 I think it enhances it is not

2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:37.400
 that equation is a minimal

2:44:38.400 --> 2:44:39.400
 compressed representation of

2:44:40.400 --> 2:44:41.400
 reality. Right.

2:44:42.400 --> 2:44:43.400
 We can use machine learning or

2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:45.400
 or Max Tecmark's AI Feynman to

2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:47.400
 find lots of solutions for

2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:49.400
 gravity. But isn't it wonderful

2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:51.400
 that the laws that we do find

2:44:52.400 --> 2:44:53.400
 are the maximally compressed

2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:55.400
 representations.

2:44:56.400 --> 2:44:57.400
 Yeah. But that representation

2:44:57.400 --> 2:44:58.400
 but then you can now give it as

2:44:59.400 --> 2:45:00.400
 a gift for free.

2:45:00.400 --> 2:45:01.400
 Yeah. Yeah.

2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:03.400
 Now I started to go for a lot

2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:04.400
 of pain together, but it's low

2:45:04.400 --> 2:45:05.400
 memory. So I say that physics

2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:07.400
 and chemistry and biology are

2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:08.400
 the same discipline.

2:45:08.400 --> 2:45:09.400
 They're just physics.

2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:11.400
 Laws in physics.

2:45:11.400 --> 2:45:12.400
 There's no such thing as a law

2:45:12.400 --> 2:45:13.400
 in physics. It's just low memory

2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:15.400
 stuff.

2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:16.400
 Because you've got low memory

2:45:16.400 --> 2:45:17.400
 stuff, you can things reoccur

2:45:18.400 --> 2:45:19.400
 quickly.

2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:20.400
 As you get building more memory,

2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:22.400
 you get to chemistry so things

2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:23.400
 become more contingent.

2:45:23.400 --> 2:45:24.400
 When you get to biology, more

2:45:25.400 --> 2:45:26.400
 contingent still and then

2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:27.400
 technology.

2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:28.400
 So the more memory you need, the

2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:30.400
 more of your laws are local.

2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:32.400
 That's all I'm saying is that

2:45:33.400 --> 2:45:34.400
 the less memory, the more the

2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:35.400
 laws are universal because they're

2:45:35.400 --> 2:45:36.400
 not laws. They are just low

2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:37.400
 memory states.

2:45:39.400 --> 2:45:41.400
 We have to talk about

2:45:42.400 --> 2:45:43.400
 a thing you've kind of mentioned

2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:44.400
 already a bunch of times, but

2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:46.400
 doing computation

2:45:47.400 --> 2:45:49.400
 through chemistry, chemical

2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:50.400
 based computation.

2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:52.400
 I've seen you and

2:45:52.400 --> 2:45:53.400
 referred to it as

2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:55.400
 in a sexy title of

2:45:56.400 --> 2:45:57.400
 camp

2:45:58.400 --> 2:45:59.400
 mutation.

2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:00.400
 So what is

2:46:01.400 --> 2:46:02.400
 computation and what is

2:46:02.400 --> 2:46:03.400
 chemical based

2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:05.400
 computation?

2:46:05.400 --> 2:46:06.400
 Okay, so

2:46:06.400 --> 2:46:07.400
 computation is a name

2:46:08.400 --> 2:46:09.400
 I gave to the process of

2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:12.400
 building a state machine to make

2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:13.400
 any molecule physically in the

2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:14.400
 lab.

2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:15.400
 And so as a

2:46:16.400 --> 2:46:17.400
 chemist, chemists make

2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:18.400
 molecules by hand.

2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:20.400
 And

2:46:21.400 --> 2:46:22.400
 they're quite hard.

2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:23.400
 They can chemists have a lot of

2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:25.400
 tacit knowledge, a lot of

2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:26.400
 ambiguity.

2:46:26.400 --> 2:46:27.400
 It's not possible to go

2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:29.400
 uniform me to literature and

2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:30.400
 read a recipe to make a

2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:32.400
 molecule and then go

2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:33.400
 and make it in the lab

2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:35.400
 every time.

2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:36.400
 Some recipes are better than

2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:38.400
 others, but they all assume

2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:40.400
 some

2:46:41.400 --> 2:46:42.400
 knowledge.

2:46:42.400 --> 2:46:43.400
 And it's not universal what

2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:44.400
 that is.

2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:46.400
 Like so it's carried from

2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:48.400
 from human to human.

2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:49.400
 Yeah.

2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:50.400
 Some of that implicit knowledge

2:46:50.400 --> 2:46:51.400
 and you're saying can we remove

2:46:51.400 --> 2:46:52.400
 the human from the picture?

2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:54.400
 Can we like a program?

2:46:54.400 --> 2:46:55.400
 Okay.

2:46:55.400 --> 2:46:56.400
 What by the way, what is a

2:46:56.400 --> 2:46:57.400
 state machine?

2:46:58.400 --> 2:47:00.400
 So a state machine is a

2:47:00.400 --> 2:47:01.400
 I suppose a

2:47:02.400 --> 2:47:04.400
 a object, either abstract

2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:06.400
 or mechanical where you can do

2:47:06.400 --> 2:47:07.400
 you can

2:47:08.400 --> 2:47:09.400
 do a unit operation on it and

2:47:09.400 --> 2:47:10.400
 flick it from one state to

2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:11.400
 another.

2:47:11.400 --> 2:47:12.400
 So a turn style would be a good

2:47:12.400 --> 2:47:14.400
 example of a state machine.

2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:16.400
 There's some kinds of states

2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:17.400
 and some kind of transitions

2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:19.400
 between states and it's

2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:20.400
 and it's

2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:23.400
 very formal in nature in

2:47:23.400 --> 2:47:24.400
 terms of like it's precise.

2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:25.400
 Yes.

2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:27.400
 Mathematically, precisely

2:47:27.400 --> 2:47:29.400
 describe a state machine.

2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:30.400
 So I mean, you know, a very

2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:31.400
 simple Boolean

2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:34.400
 gates are a very good way

2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:36.400
 of building kind of logic based

2:47:36.400 --> 2:47:37.400
 state machines.

2:47:38.400 --> 2:47:39.400
 Obviously a Turing machine,

2:47:39.400 --> 2:47:41.400
 the concept of a Turing machine

2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:42.400
 where you have a tape and a

2:47:42.400 --> 2:47:44.400
 reed head and a series of

2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:46.400
 rules in a table and you would

2:47:46.400 --> 2:47:48.400
 basically look at what's on the

2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:50.400
 tape and if you're shifting the

2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:51.400
 tape from left to right and if

2:47:51.400 --> 2:47:53.400
 you see a zero or one, you

2:47:53.400 --> 2:47:54.400
 look in your lookup table and

2:47:54.400 --> 2:47:55.400
 say, right, I've seen a zero and

2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:56.400
 a one.

2:47:57.400 --> 2:47:58.400
 I then do

2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:01.400
 and then respond to that.

2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:03.400
 So in the turn style would be

2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:04.400
 is there a human being pushing

2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:06.400
 the turn style in

2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:08.400
 direction clockwise?

2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:10.400
 If yes, I will open

2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:11.400
 and let them go.

2:48:11.400 --> 2:48:12.400
 If it's anticlockwise, no.

2:48:12.400 --> 2:48:13.400
 So yes.

2:48:13.400 --> 2:48:14.400
 So a state machine has some

2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:15.400
 labels and a transition

2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:17.400
 transition diagram.

2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:19.400
 So you're looking to

2:48:19.400 --> 2:48:21.400
 come up with a chemical

2:48:21.400 --> 2:48:23.400
 computer to form state machines

2:48:23.400 --> 2:48:25.400
 to create molecules

2:48:25.400 --> 2:48:27.400
 or what's

2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:29.400
 the chicken and the egg?

2:48:29.400 --> 2:48:30.400
 So computation is not a chemical

2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:31.400
 computer because we talked a few

2:48:31.400 --> 2:48:33.400
 minutes about actually doing

2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:34.400
 computations with chemicals.

2:48:34.400 --> 2:48:36.400
 What I'm now saying is I want to

2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:38.400
 use state machines to transform

2:48:38.400 --> 2:48:40.400
 chemicals and so.

2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:41.400
 So build chemicals

2:48:41.400 --> 2:48:42.400
 programmatically.

2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:43.400
 Yeah.

2:48:43.400 --> 2:48:44.400
 I mean, I get in trouble saying

2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:45.400
 this.

2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:46.400
 I said to my group, I shouldn't

2:48:46.400 --> 2:48:48.400
 say it because if I said, look,

2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:49.400
 we should make the crack bot in

2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:50.400
 the crack robot.

2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:52.400
 The robot that makes crack bot.

2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:54.400
 Oh, crack bot.

2:48:54.400 --> 2:48:56.400
 The robot that makes crack.

2:48:56.400 --> 2:48:57.400
 But maybe we should scrub this

2:48:57.400 --> 2:48:58.400
 from.

2:48:58.400 --> 2:48:59.400
 Or

2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:02.400
 or well, so maybe you can

2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:04.400
 educate me on breaking bad

2:49:04.400 --> 2:49:05.400
 with like math.

2:49:05.400 --> 2:49:06.400
 Yeah.

2:49:06.400 --> 2:49:07.400
 So in breaking bad, you want to

2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:09.400
 make you want to make

2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:11.400
 basically some kind of mix of

2:49:11.400 --> 2:49:14.400
 X machina and breaking bad.

2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:15.400
 No, I don't.

2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:16.400
 I don't record.

2:49:16.400 --> 2:49:17.400
 I don't.

2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:18.400
 But you don't.

2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:19.400
 I said, that's what I'm going to

2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:20.400
 do.

2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:23.400
 Once you release the papers.

2:49:23.400 --> 2:49:25.400
 But I shave my head

2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:27.400
 and I'm going to

2:49:27.400 --> 2:49:28.400
 live a life of crime.

2:49:28.400 --> 2:49:29.400
 Anyway, I'm sorry.

2:49:29.400 --> 2:49:30.400
 No, no.

2:49:30.400 --> 2:49:31.400
 So, so yeah, let's get back to

2:49:31.400 --> 2:49:33.400
 so indeed it is about making

2:49:33.400 --> 2:49:35.400
 drugs, but importantly, making

2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:37.400
 important drugs.

2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:39.400
 All drugs matter.

2:49:39.400 --> 2:49:40.400
 Yeah.

2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:41.400
 But let's go.

2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:42.400
 Let's go back.

2:49:42.400 --> 2:49:43.400
 So the basic thesis is chemistry

2:49:43.400 --> 2:49:45.400
 is very analog.

2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:48.400
 There is no state machine.

2:49:48.400 --> 2:49:50.400
 And I wandered into the

2:49:50.400 --> 2:49:52.400
 through the paper walls in the

2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:53.400
 in the Japanese house a few years

2:49:53.400 --> 2:49:55.400
 ago and said, OK, hey, organic

2:49:55.400 --> 2:49:56.400
 chemist, why are you why are you

2:49:56.400 --> 2:49:57.400
 doing this analog?

2:49:57.400 --> 2:49:59.400
 They said, well, chemistry is

2:49:59.400 --> 2:50:00.400
 really hard.

2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:01.400
 You can't automate it.

2:50:01.400 --> 2:50:02.400
 It's impossible.

2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:04.400
 I said, but is it impossible?

2:50:04.400 --> 2:50:05.400
 I said, yeah.

2:50:05.400 --> 2:50:06.400
 And they said, you know, I got

2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:07.400
 the impression they're saying

2:50:07.400 --> 2:50:08.400
 it's magic.

2:50:08.400 --> 2:50:10.400
 And so when people tell me things

2:50:10.400 --> 2:50:12.400
 are magic, it's like, no, no,

2:50:12.400 --> 2:50:13.400
 they can't be magic.

2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:14.400
 Right.

2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:15.400
 So let's break this down.

2:50:15.400 --> 2:50:17.400
 And so what I did is I went to

2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:19.400
 my my group one day about

2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:20.400
 about eight years ago and said,

2:50:20.400 --> 2:50:21.400
 hey, guys, I've written this new

2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:23.400
 programming language for you.

2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:25.400
 And so everything is clear.

2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:26.400
 And, you know, you have to, you're

2:50:26.400 --> 2:50:28.400
 not allowed to just wander around

2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:29.400
 the lab willy nilly.

2:50:29.400 --> 2:50:30.400
 You have to pick up things in

2:50:30.400 --> 2:50:31.400
 order, go to the balance of the

2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:33.400
 right time and all this stuff.

2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:34.400
 And they looked at me as if I

2:50:34.400 --> 2:50:35.400
 was insane and basically kicked

2:50:35.400 --> 2:50:36.400
 me out of the lab and said, no,

2:50:36.400 --> 2:50:37.400
 don't do that.

2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:38.400
 We're not doing that.

2:50:38.400 --> 2:50:39.400
 And I said, OK, so I went back

2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:41.400
 the next day and said,

2:50:41.400 --> 2:50:43.400
 I'm going to find some money so

2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:45.400
 we can make cool robots do

2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:46.400
 chemical reactions.

2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:47.400
 And everyone went, that's cool.

2:50:47.400 --> 2:50:48.400
 Yeah.

2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:50.400
 And so in that process,

2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:52.400
 the first to try to convert the

2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:54.400
 humans to become robots and next

2:50:54.400 --> 2:50:55.400
 you could you agree you might as

2:50:55.400 --> 2:50:56.400
 well just create the robots.

2:50:56.400 --> 2:50:57.400
 Yes.

2:50:57.400 --> 2:50:58.400
 But so in that, in that the

2:50:58.400 --> 2:50:59.400
 formalization process.

2:50:59.400 --> 2:51:00.400
 Yeah.

2:51:00.400 --> 2:51:01.400
 So what I did is said, look,

2:51:01.400 --> 2:51:02.400
 chemical to make a molecule,

2:51:02.400 --> 2:51:03.400
 you need to do four things

2:51:03.400 --> 2:51:04.400
 abstractly.

2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:05.400
 I want to make a chemical

2:51:05.400 --> 2:51:06.400
 Turing machine because a Turing

2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:08.400
 machine, you think about this,

2:51:08.400 --> 2:51:09.400
 imagine a Turing machine.

2:51:09.400 --> 2:51:10.400
 Turing machine is the ultimate

2:51:10.400 --> 2:51:13.400
 abstraction of a computation

2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:16.400
 because it's been shown by Turing

2:51:16.400 --> 2:51:18.400
 and others that basically a

2:51:18.400 --> 2:51:19.400
 universal Turing machine should

2:51:19.400 --> 2:51:21.400
 be able to do all computations

2:51:21.400 --> 2:51:22.400
 that you can imagine.

2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:24.400
 It's like, wow, why don't I think

2:51:24.400 --> 2:51:25.400
 of a Turing machine for chemistry?

2:51:25.400 --> 2:51:27.400
 Let's think of a magic robot that

2:51:27.400 --> 2:51:28.400
 can make any molecule.

2:51:28.400 --> 2:51:30.400
 Let's think about that for a

2:51:30.400 --> 2:51:31.400
 second.

2:51:31.400 --> 2:51:32.400
 OK, great.

2:51:32.400 --> 2:51:33.400
 How do we then implement it?

2:51:33.400 --> 2:51:34.400
 And I think it's right.

2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:35.400
 So what is the abstraction?

2:51:35.400 --> 2:51:37.400
 So to make any molecule,

2:51:37.400 --> 2:51:38.400
 you have to do a reaction.

2:51:38.400 --> 2:51:39.400
 So you have to put reagents

2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:40.400
 together.

2:51:40.400 --> 2:51:42.400
 Do a reaction in a flask,

2:51:42.400 --> 2:51:43.400
 typically.

2:51:43.400 --> 2:51:44.400
 Then after the reaction,

2:51:44.400 --> 2:51:45.400
 you have to stop the reactions.

2:51:45.400 --> 2:51:47.400
 You do what's called a workup.

2:51:47.400 --> 2:51:48.400
 So whatever.

2:51:48.400 --> 2:51:49.400
 Call it down.

2:51:49.400 --> 2:51:50.400
 Add some liquid to it.

2:51:50.400 --> 2:51:51.400
 Extract.

2:51:51.400 --> 2:51:52.400
 So then after you do a workup,

2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:53.400
 you separate.

2:51:53.400 --> 2:51:54.400
 So you then remove the molecules,

2:51:54.400 --> 2:51:55.400
 separate them all out.

2:51:55.400 --> 2:51:57.400
 And then the final step is purification.

2:51:57.400 --> 2:51:59.400
 So reaction, workup,

2:51:59.400 --> 2:52:01.400
 separate, purify.

2:52:01.400 --> 2:52:03.400
 So this is basically exactly

2:52:03.400 --> 2:52:05.400
 like a Turing machine

2:52:05.400 --> 2:52:06.400
 where you have your tape,

2:52:06.400 --> 2:52:07.400
 you have your tape head,

2:52:07.400 --> 2:52:09.400
 you have some rules,

2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:10.400
 and then you run it.

2:52:10.400 --> 2:52:11.400
 So I thought, cool.

2:52:11.400 --> 2:52:12.400
 I went to all the chemists

2:52:12.400 --> 2:52:13.400
 and said, look,

2:52:13.400 --> 2:52:15.400
 chemistry isn't that hard.

2:52:15.400 --> 2:52:17.400
 Reaction, workup,

2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:18.400
 separation, purification.

2:52:18.400 --> 2:52:20.400
 Do that in cycles forever

2:52:20.400 --> 2:52:22.400
 for any molecule or the chemistry.

2:52:22.400 --> 2:52:23.400
 Done.

2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:24.400
 And they said,

2:52:24.400 --> 2:52:26.400
 chemistry is that hard.

2:52:26.400 --> 2:52:28.400
 I said, but just in principle.

2:52:28.400 --> 2:52:30.400
 And I got a few very enlightened people

2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:31.400
 to say, yeah, OK, in principle,

2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:33.400
 but it ain't going to work.

2:52:33.400 --> 2:52:36.400
 And this was in about 2013, 2014.

2:52:36.400 --> 2:52:38.400
 And I found myself going to

2:52:38.400 --> 2:52:39.400
 an architecture conference

2:52:39.400 --> 2:52:40.400
 almost by accident.

2:52:40.400 --> 2:52:42.400
 It's like, why am I at this random

2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:44.400
 conference on architecture?

2:52:44.400 --> 2:52:46.400
 And that was because I published a paper

2:52:46.400 --> 2:52:47.400
 on inorganic architecture.

2:52:47.400 --> 2:52:49.400
 And they said, come to architecture conference.

2:52:49.400 --> 2:52:50.400
 But the inorganic architecture

2:52:50.400 --> 2:52:51.400
 was about nano architecture.

2:52:51.400 --> 2:52:52.400
 It's not.

2:52:52.400 --> 2:52:53.400
 And I went, OK.

2:52:53.400 --> 2:52:54.400
 And then I found these guys at the conference,

2:52:54.400 --> 2:52:57.400
 3D printing ping pong balls and shapes.

2:52:57.400 --> 2:52:58.400
 And this is through it.

2:52:58.400 --> 2:52:59.400
 3D printing was cool.

2:52:59.400 --> 2:53:00.400
 And I was like, this is ridiculous.

2:53:00.400 --> 2:53:01.400
 Why are you 3D printing ping pong balls?

2:53:01.400 --> 2:53:03.400
 And I gave them a whole load of abuse,

2:53:03.400 --> 2:53:05.400
 like I normally do when I first meet people,

2:53:05.400 --> 2:53:07.400
 how to win friends and influence people.

2:53:07.400 --> 2:53:09.400
 And then I was like, oh, my God,

2:53:09.400 --> 2:53:10.400
 you guys are geniuses.

2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:12.400
 And so I got from, they were a bit confused

2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:13.400
 because I was calling them idiots

2:53:13.400 --> 2:53:14.400
 and then calling them geniuses.

2:53:14.400 --> 2:53:16.400
 It's like, will you come to my lab

2:53:16.400 --> 2:53:18.400
 and we're going to build a robot to do chemistry

2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:19.400
 with a 3D printer?

2:53:19.400 --> 2:53:20.400
 And I said, oh, that's cool.

2:53:20.400 --> 2:53:21.400
 All right.

2:53:21.400 --> 2:53:22.400
 So I had them come to the lab

2:53:22.400 --> 2:53:24.400
 and we started to 3D print test tubes.

2:53:24.400 --> 2:53:27.400
 So you imagine, you know, 3D print a bottle

2:53:27.400 --> 2:53:30.400
 and then used the same gantry to basically,

2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:34.400
 rather than to squirt out plastic out of a nozzle,

2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:36.400
 a little syringe and jump chemicals in.

2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:37.400
 So we had the 3D printer

2:53:37.400 --> 2:53:39.400
 because simultaneously print the test tube

2:53:39.400 --> 2:53:41.400
 and then put chemicals into the test tube.

2:53:41.400 --> 2:53:42.400
 And then...

2:53:42.400 --> 2:53:44.400
 Well, it says really end to end.

2:53:44.400 --> 2:53:45.400
 Yeah.

2:53:45.400 --> 2:53:46.400
 And I was like, that'll be cool

2:53:46.400 --> 2:53:47.400
 because they've got G code to do it all.

2:53:47.400 --> 2:53:48.400
 I was like, that's cool.

2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:49.400
 So I got my group doing this

2:53:49.400 --> 2:53:50.400
 and I developed it a bit

2:53:50.400 --> 2:53:54.400
 and I realized that we could take those unit operations

2:53:54.400 --> 2:53:56.400
 and we built a whole bunch of pumps and valves.

2:53:56.400 --> 2:54:00.400
 And I realized that I could basically take the literature

2:54:00.400 --> 2:54:05.400
 and I made the first version of the computer in 2016, 17.

2:54:05.400 --> 2:54:07.400
 I made some architectural decisions.

2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:09.400
 So I designed the pumps and valves in my group.

2:54:09.400 --> 2:54:10.400
 I did all the electronics in my group.

2:54:10.400 --> 2:54:11.400
 They were brilliant.

2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:15.400
 I cannot pay tribute to my group enough in doing this.

2:54:15.400 --> 2:54:16.400
 They were just brilliant.

2:54:16.400 --> 2:54:18.400
 And there were some poor souls there that said,

2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:21.400
 Lee, why are you making this design electronics?

2:54:21.400 --> 2:54:23.400
 I'm like, well, because I don't understand it.

2:54:23.400 --> 2:54:25.400
 They're like, so you're making this design stuff

2:54:25.400 --> 2:54:26.400
 because you don't understand.

2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:27.400
 It's like, yeah, it's like,

2:54:27.400 --> 2:54:29.400
 but can we not just buy some?

2:54:29.400 --> 2:54:30.400
 I said, well, we can,

2:54:30.400 --> 2:54:32.400
 but then I don't understand how to, you know,

2:54:32.400 --> 2:54:34.400
 what bus they're going to use

2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:35.400
 and there's serial ports and all this stuff.

2:54:35.400 --> 2:54:37.400
 I just wanted, and I made,

2:54:37.400 --> 2:54:40.400
 I came up with the decision to design a bunch of pumps and valves

2:54:40.400 --> 2:54:42.400
 and use power over ethernet.

2:54:42.400 --> 2:54:45.400
 So I got one cable for power and data, plug them all in,

2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:47.400
 plug them all into a router.

2:54:47.400 --> 2:54:50.400
 And then I made the state machine

2:54:50.400 --> 2:54:53.400
 and there was a couple of cool things I did.

2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:55.400
 Oh, they did actually.

2:54:55.400 --> 2:54:56.400
 We got the abstraction.

2:54:56.400 --> 2:55:02.400
 So reaction, workup separation, purification.

2:55:02.400 --> 2:55:05.400
 And then I made the decision to do it in batch.

2:55:05.400 --> 2:55:07.400
 Now it's in batch.

2:55:07.400 --> 2:55:10.400
 All chemistry had been digitized before, apparently,

2:55:10.400 --> 2:55:11.400
 once it's been done,

2:55:11.400 --> 2:55:13.400
 but everyone had been doing it in flow

2:55:13.400 --> 2:55:16.400
 and flow is continuous and there are infinities everywhere

2:55:16.400 --> 2:55:17.400
 and you have to just,

2:55:17.400 --> 2:55:20.400
 and I realized that I could actually make a state machine

2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:24.400
 where I basically put stuff in the reactor,

2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:26.400
 turn it from one state to another state,

2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:28.400
 stop it and just read it out.

2:55:28.400 --> 2:55:30.400
 And okay, and I was kind of bitching

2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:31.400
 at electrical engineers saying,

2:55:31.400 --> 2:55:32.400
 you have it easy.

2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:34.400
 You don't have to clean out the electrons.

2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:36.400
 Electrons don't leave a big mess.

2:55:36.400 --> 2:55:37.400
 They leave some EM waste.

2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:39.400
 But in my state machine, I built in cleaning.

2:55:39.400 --> 2:55:41.400
 So it's like we do all the operation

2:55:41.400 --> 2:55:43.400
 and then it cleans the backbone and then can do it again.

2:55:43.400 --> 2:55:44.400
 That's fascinating.

2:55:44.400 --> 2:55:47.400
 So what we managed to do over a couple of years

2:55:47.400 --> 2:55:50.400
 is develop the hardware, develop the state machine,

2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:52.400
 and we encoded three molecules.

2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:54.400
 The first three, we did nitole, sleeping drug,

2:55:54.400 --> 2:55:56.400
 refinimide, anti seizure, and Viagra.

2:55:56.400 --> 2:55:59.400
 And I could make jokes on the paper.

2:55:59.400 --> 2:56:01.400
 It's a hard problem, blah, blah, blah.

2:56:01.400 --> 2:56:03.400
 Yeah, that's very good.

2:56:03.400 --> 2:56:05.400
 And then in the next one, what we did is said,

2:56:05.400 --> 2:56:07.400
 okay, my poor organic chemist said,

2:56:07.400 --> 2:56:10.400
 look, Lee, we've worked with you this long.

2:56:10.400 --> 2:56:12.400
 We've made a robot that looks like

2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:14.400
 is going to take our jobs away

2:56:14.400 --> 2:56:17.400
 and not just take our jobs away,

2:56:17.400 --> 2:56:18.400
 what we love in the lab,

2:56:18.400 --> 2:56:20.400
 but now we have to become programmers,

2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:21.400
 but we're not even good programmers.

2:56:21.400 --> 2:56:24.400
 We just have to spend ages writing lines of code

2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:27.400
 that are boring and it's not as elegant.

2:56:27.400 --> 2:56:28.400
 I went, you're right.

2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:32.400
 So then, but I knew because I had this abstraction

2:56:32.400 --> 2:56:34.400
 and I knew that there was language,

2:56:34.400 --> 2:56:36.400
 I could suddenly develop a state machine

2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:37.400
 that would interpret the language

2:56:37.400 --> 2:56:39.400
 which was lossy and ambiguous

2:56:39.400 --> 2:56:41.400
 and populate my abstraction.

2:56:41.400 --> 2:56:43.400
 So I built a chemical programming language

2:56:43.400 --> 2:56:46.400
 that is actually going to be recursively enumerable.

2:56:46.400 --> 2:56:48.400
 It's going to be a Turing complete language, actually,

2:56:48.400 --> 2:56:49.400
 which is kind of cool,

2:56:49.400 --> 2:56:51.400
 which means it's for me verifiable.

2:56:51.400 --> 2:56:54.400
 So where we are now is we can now

2:56:54.400 --> 2:56:56.400
 read the literature using a bit of natural language processing.

2:56:56.400 --> 2:56:57.400
 It's not the best.

2:56:57.400 --> 2:56:59.400
 Many other groups have done better job,

2:56:59.400 --> 2:57:01.400
 but we can use that language reading

2:57:01.400 --> 2:57:03.400
 to populate the state machine

2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:05.400
 and basically add, subtract.

2:57:05.400 --> 2:57:08.400
 We've got about a number of primitives

2:57:08.400 --> 2:57:11.400
 that we, you know,

2:57:11.400 --> 2:57:14.400
 basically program loops that we dovetail together

2:57:14.400 --> 2:57:15.400
 and we can make any molecule with it.

2:57:15.400 --> 2:57:16.400
 Okay.

2:57:16.400 --> 2:57:18.400
 So that's the kind of program synthesis.

2:57:18.400 --> 2:57:20.400
 So you start at, like, literally,

2:57:20.400 --> 2:57:22.400
 you're talking about like a paper,

2:57:22.400 --> 2:57:25.400
 like a scientific paper that's being read

2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:27.400
 to natural language processing,

2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:31.400
 extracting some kind of details

2:57:31.400 --> 2:57:33.400
 about chemical reactions

2:57:33.400 --> 2:57:38.400
 and the chemical molecules and compounds involved.

2:57:38.400 --> 2:57:44.400
 And then that's, that in GPT terms

2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:47.400
 serves as a prompt for the program synthesis

2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:49.400
 that's kind of trivial right now.

2:57:49.400 --> 2:57:51.400
 There you have a bunch of different like for loops and so on

2:57:51.400 --> 2:57:55.400
 that creates a program in this chemical language

2:57:55.400 --> 2:57:59.400
 that can then be interpreted by the chemical computer,

2:57:59.400 --> 2:58:01.400
 the computer.

2:58:01.400 --> 2:58:02.400
 Yeah, computer.

2:58:02.400 --> 2:58:03.400
 Yeah.

2:58:05.400 --> 2:58:07.400
 Everything sounds better in your British accent,

2:58:07.400 --> 2:58:09.400
 but I love it.

2:58:09.400 --> 2:58:12.400
 So the, into the computer and that's able to then

2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:16.400
 basically be a 3D printer for these, for molecules.

2:58:16.400 --> 2:58:18.400
 Yeah, I wouldn't call it a 3D printer.

2:58:18.400 --> 2:58:20.400
 I would call it a universal chemical reaction system

2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:22.400
 because 3D printing gives the wrong impression,

2:58:22.400 --> 2:58:24.400
 but yeah, and it purifies.

2:58:24.400 --> 2:58:27.400
 And the nice thing is that that code now that we call it,

2:58:27.400 --> 2:58:32.400
 the QIDL code is really interesting

2:58:32.400 --> 2:58:35.400
 because now, so computation, what is computation?

2:58:35.400 --> 2:58:40.400
 Computation is what computing is to mathematics, I think.

2:58:40.400 --> 2:58:44.400
 Computation is the process of taking chemical code

2:58:44.400 --> 2:58:47.400
 and some input reagents and making the same molecule,

2:58:47.400 --> 2:58:51.400
 making the molecule reproducibly every time without fail.

2:58:51.400 --> 2:58:53.400
 What is computation?

2:58:53.400 --> 2:58:57.400
 It's the process of using a program to take some input conditions

2:58:57.400 --> 2:59:00.400
 and give you an output, same every time.

2:59:00.400 --> 2:59:02.400
 Right, reliably.

2:59:02.400 --> 2:59:05.400
 So the problem is, now maybe you can push back

2:59:05.400 --> 2:59:07.400
 and correct me on this.

2:59:07.400 --> 2:59:09.400
 So I know biology is messy.

2:59:09.400 --> 2:59:12.400
 My question is how messy is chemistry?

2:59:12.400 --> 2:59:15.400
 So if we use the analogy of a computer,

2:59:15.400 --> 2:59:21.400
 it's easier to make computation in a computer very precise.

2:59:21.400 --> 2:59:23.400
 It's repeatable.

2:59:23.400 --> 2:59:26.400
 It makes errors almost never.

2:59:26.400 --> 2:59:29.400
 It does the exact same way over and over and over and over.

2:59:29.400 --> 2:59:30.400
 What about chemistry?

2:59:30.400 --> 2:59:32.400
 Is there messiness in the whole thing?

2:59:32.400 --> 2:59:34.400
 Can that be somehow leveraged?

2:59:34.400 --> 2:59:36.400
 Can that be controlled?

2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:38.400
 Do we want to remove it from the system?

2:59:38.400 --> 2:59:40.400
 Oh, yes and no.

2:59:40.400 --> 2:59:46.400
 There is messiness because chemistry is like you're doing reactions

2:59:46.400 --> 2:59:49.400
 on billions of molecules and they don't always work,

2:59:49.400 --> 2:59:51.400
 but you've got purification there.

2:59:51.400 --> 2:59:55.400
 And so what we found is at the beginning, everyone said it can't work.

2:59:55.400 --> 2:59:56.400
 It's going to be too messy.

2:59:56.400 --> 2:59:57.400
 It will just fail.

2:59:57.400 --> 3:00:00.400
 And I said, but you managed to get chemistry to work in the lab.

3:00:00.400 --> 3:00:01.400
 Are you magic?

3:00:01.400 --> 3:00:02.400
 Are you doing something?

3:00:02.400 --> 3:00:07.400
 So I would say, now go back to the first ever computer or the ENIAC.

3:00:07.400 --> 3:00:12.400
 Five million soldered joints, 400,000 valves exploding all the time.

3:00:12.400 --> 3:00:13.400
 Was that?

3:00:13.400 --> 3:00:16.400
 Would you have gone, okay, that's messy.

3:00:16.400 --> 3:00:20.400
 So we've got the, have we got the equivalent of the ENIAC in my lab?

3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:23.400
 We've got 15 computers in the lab now.

3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:24.400
 And they, are they unreliable?

3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:29.400
 Yeah, they fall apart here and there, but are they getting better really quickly?

3:00:29.400 --> 3:00:30.400
 Yeah.

3:00:30.400 --> 3:00:32.400
 Are they now able to reliably make more?

3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:34.400
 Are we at the point in the lab where there are some molecules

3:00:34.400 --> 3:00:38.400
 we would rather make on the computer than have a human being make?

3:00:38.400 --> 3:00:39.400
 Yeah.

3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:45.400
 We've just done, we've just made a anti influenza molecule and some antivirals,

3:00:45.400 --> 3:00:51.400
 six steps on the computer that would take a human being about one week to make

3:00:51.400 --> 3:00:56.400
 arbidol of continuous labor and all they do now is load up the reagents, press go button

3:00:56.400 --> 3:00:58.400
 and just go away and drink coffee.

3:00:58.400 --> 3:00:59.400
 Wow.

3:00:59.400 --> 3:01:03.400
 So this, I mean, and this is, you're saying this computer is just the early days.

3:01:03.400 --> 3:01:07.400
 And so like some of the criticism just have to do with the early days.

3:01:07.400 --> 3:01:14.400
 And yes, I would say there's something like this is quite impossible.

3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:17.400
 So the fact that you're doing this is incredible.

3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:20.400
 Not impossible, of course, but extremely difficult.

3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:22.400
 It did seem really difficult.

3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:24.400
 And I do keep pinching myself when I go in the lab.

3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:25.400
 I was like, is it working?

3:01:25.400 --> 3:01:26.400
 Like, yep.

3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:28.400
 And it's not, you know, it does clog.

3:01:28.400 --> 3:01:30.400
 It does stop.

3:01:30.400 --> 3:01:31.400
 You got to clean.

3:01:31.400 --> 3:01:32.400
 This is great.

3:01:32.400 --> 3:01:37.400
 You know, but it's getting more reliable because I made some, we just made design

3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:40.400
 decisions and said, we are not going to abandon the abstraction.

3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:41.400
 Think about it.

3:01:41.400 --> 3:01:47.400
 If the Von Neumann implementation was abandoned, I mean, think about what we do to

3:01:47.400 --> 3:01:53.400
 semiconductors to really constrain them to what we do to silicon in a fab lab.

3:01:53.400 --> 3:01:55.400
 We take computation for granted.

3:01:55.400 --> 3:01:57.400
 Silicon is not in its natural state.

3:01:57.400 --> 3:01:59.400
 We are doping the hell out of it.

3:01:59.400 --> 3:02:01.400
 It's incredible what they're able to accomplish.

3:02:01.400 --> 3:02:03.400
 They've achieved that reliability at the scale they do.

3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:07.400
 Like you said, that's after Moore's law what we have now.

3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:13.400
 And where we, you know, how it started, you know, now we're here.

3:02:13.400 --> 3:02:14.400
 So think about it now.

3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:15.400
 We started at the bottom.

3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:16.400
 Now we're here.

3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:17.400
 We only have 20 million molecules.

3:02:17.400 --> 3:02:19.400
 Well, say 20 million molecules in one database.

3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:23.400
 Maybe a few hundred million in all the pharmaceutical companies.

3:02:23.400 --> 3:02:27.400
 And those few hundred million molecules are responsible for all the drugs that we've

3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:31.400
 had in humanity except, you know, biologics for the last 50 years.

3:02:31.400 --> 3:02:36.400
 Now imagine what happens when a drug goes out of print, goes out of prints because

3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:39.400
 there's only a finite number of manufacturing facilities in the world that make these drugs.

3:02:39.400 --> 3:02:40.400
 Is that a print?

3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:41.400
 Yeah.

3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:42.400
 This is a printing press.

3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:43.400
 For chemistry.

3:02:43.400 --> 3:02:44.400
 Yeah.

3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:49.400
 And not only that, we can protect the KIDL so we can stop bad actors doing it.

3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:50.400
 We can encrypt them.

3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:51.400
 And we can give people life.

3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:54.400
 Yeah, that's the name of the programing language.

3:02:54.400 --> 3:02:58.400
 The KIDL is the name of the programming language and the code we give the chemicals.

3:02:58.400 --> 3:03:04.400
 So Kai, as in, you know, just for, it's like a, it's actually like an XML format, but

3:03:04.400 --> 3:03:11.400
 I've now taken it from script to a fully expressible programming language so we can do dynamics

3:03:11.400 --> 3:03:13.400
 and there's four loops in there and conditional statements.

3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:14.400
 Right.

3:03:14.400 --> 3:03:19.400
 But the structure, it started out as a, like a, like an XML thing.

3:03:19.400 --> 3:03:20.400
 Yeah.

3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:22.400
 And now we also, the chemist doesn't need to program in KIDL.

3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:27.000
 They can just go to the software and type in add A to B, reflux, do what they would normally

3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:30.400
 do and you just convert it to KIDL and they have a linter to check it.

3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:36.900
 So how do you, you know, not with ASCII, but because it's a Greek letter, how do you go

3:03:36.900 --> 3:03:39.900
 with, how do you spell it?

3:03:39.900 --> 3:03:42.400
 Just using the English alphabet.

3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:43.400
 We just, XDL?

3:03:43.400 --> 3:03:45.400
 XDL or we use, we put in Kai.

3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:50.120
 And it was named by one of my students and I, one of my postdocs many years ago and I

3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:54.600
 quite liked it, it's like, it's important, I think, when the team are contributing to

3:03:54.600 --> 3:03:59.400
 such big ideas, because there are ideas as well, it's, I try not to just rename, I didn't

3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:06.520
 call it Cronin or anything that because they keep saying, you know, is a, is a, the chemistry

3:04:06.520 --> 3:04:09.680
 when they're putting stuff in the computer, one of my students said, we are asking now,

3:04:09.680 --> 3:04:10.680
 is it Cronin complete?

3:04:10.680 --> 3:04:11.680
 And I was like, what does that mean?

3:04:11.680 --> 3:04:14.200
 And I said, well, can we make it on the damn machine?

3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:18.600
 And I was like, oh, is that a compliment or a, or a majority of it?

3:04:18.600 --> 3:04:21.600
 And I was like, well, it might be better.

3:04:21.600 --> 3:04:22.600
 Yeah.

3:04:22.600 --> 3:04:27.680
 So you tweeted, quote, why does chemistry need a universal programming language?

3:04:27.680 --> 3:04:29.760
 Question mark.

3:04:29.760 --> 3:04:37.240
 For all the reasons you can think of, reliability, interoperability, collaboration, remove ambiguity,

3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:43.800
 lower cost, increase safety, open up discovery, molecular customization, and publication

3:04:43.800 --> 3:04:52.240
 of executable chemical code, which is fascinating, by the way, just publish code.

3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:58.160
 And can you maybe elaborate a little bit more about this KDL?

3:04:58.160 --> 3:05:01.440
 What does the universal language of chemistry look like?

3:05:01.440 --> 3:05:04.920
 A Cronin complete language?

3:05:04.920 --> 3:05:07.520
 It's a Turing complete language, really.

3:05:07.520 --> 3:05:15.640
 But so what it has, it has a series of operators in it, like add, heat, stir.

3:05:15.640 --> 3:05:18.040
 So there's a bunch of just unit operations.

3:05:18.040 --> 3:05:22.920
 And all it is really is just, it's, with chemical engineers, when I talked about this, that you've

3:05:22.920 --> 3:05:25.840
 just read, you've just, you've just rediscovered chemical engineering.

3:05:25.840 --> 3:05:27.640
 And I said, well, yeah, I know.

3:05:27.640 --> 3:05:30.040
 I said, well, that's, you know, that's trivial.

3:05:30.040 --> 3:05:32.960
 I said, well, well, not really, well, yes, it is trivial.

3:05:32.960 --> 3:05:33.960
 That's why it's good.

3:05:33.960 --> 3:05:37.960
 Because not only have we rediscovered chemical engineering, we've made it implementable on

3:05:37.960 --> 3:05:40.840
 the universal hardware that doesn't cost very much money.

3:05:40.840 --> 3:05:46.240
 And so the KDL has a series of statements, like define the reactor.

3:05:46.240 --> 3:05:52.400
 So defines the reagents, so they're all labels, so you assign them.

3:05:52.400 --> 3:05:58.000
 And what I also implemented at the beginning is, because I give all the hardware IP address,

3:05:58.000 --> 3:05:59.600
 you put it on a graph.

3:05:59.600 --> 3:06:05.880
 And so what it does is like the graph is equivalent to the, the processor firmware, the processor

3:06:05.880 --> 3:06:06.880
 code.

3:06:06.880 --> 3:06:11.080
 So when you take your KDL and you go to run it on your computer, you can run it on any

3:06:11.080 --> 3:06:14.080
 compatible hardware in any configuration, says, what's your, what's your graph look

3:06:14.080 --> 3:06:15.080
 like?

3:06:15.080 --> 3:06:19.120
 As long as I can solve the problem on the graph with these unit operations, you have the resources

3:06:19.120 --> 3:06:20.120
 available.

3:06:20.120 --> 3:06:21.120
 It can compile.

3:06:21.120 --> 3:06:22.120
 Chem piles.

3:06:22.120 --> 3:06:27.000
 We can carry on for years.

3:06:27.000 --> 3:06:29.920
 But it is really, it's a compilation.

3:06:29.920 --> 3:06:35.280
 And what it now does is it says, okay, the problem we have before is it was possible

3:06:35.280 --> 3:06:39.440
 to do robotics for chemistry, but the robots were really expensive.

3:06:39.440 --> 3:06:40.440
 They were unique.

3:06:40.440 --> 3:06:42.880
 They were vendor locked.

3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:46.680
 And what I want to do is to make sure that every chemist in the world can get access

3:06:46.680 --> 3:06:51.840
 to machinery like this at virtually no cost because it makes it safer.

3:06:51.840 --> 3:06:53.760
 It makes it more reliable.

3:06:53.760 --> 3:06:57.080
 And then if you go to the literature and you find a molecule that could potentially cure

3:06:57.080 --> 3:07:01.440
 cancer, and let's say the molecule that could potentially cure cancer takes you three years

3:07:01.440 --> 3:07:03.600
 to repeat.

3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:10.040
 And maybe a student finishes their PhD in the time and they never get it back.

3:07:10.040 --> 3:07:14.120
 So it's really hard to, to kind of get all the way to that molecule and it limits the

3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:16.480
 ability of humanity to build on it.

3:07:16.480 --> 3:07:22.240
 If they just download the code and can execute it, it turns, I would say the electronic laboratory

3:07:22.240 --> 3:07:28.400
 notebook in chemistry is a data cemetery because no one will ever reproduce it.

3:07:28.400 --> 3:07:31.960
 But now the data cemetery is a Jupiter notebook and you can just execute it.

3:07:31.960 --> 3:07:33.640
 A notebook and people can play with it.

3:07:33.640 --> 3:07:37.920
 The access to it, the magnitude is increased.

3:07:37.920 --> 3:07:43.880
 We'll talk about the, so as with all technologies, I think there's way more exciting possibilities,

3:07:43.880 --> 3:07:47.560
 but they're also terrifying possibilities and we'll talk about all of them.

3:07:47.560 --> 3:07:51.480
 But let me just kind of linger on the machine learning side of this.

3:07:51.480 --> 3:07:57.400
 So you're describing programming, but it's a language, I don't know if you've heard

3:07:57.400 --> 3:07:59.480
 about Open AI Codex, which is a...

3:07:59.480 --> 3:08:01.480
 Yeah, I'm playing with it.

3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:06.200
 Of course you are.

3:08:06.200 --> 3:08:08.080
 You really are Rick from Rick and Morty.

3:08:08.080 --> 3:08:09.080
 This is great.

3:08:09.080 --> 3:08:10.080
 Okay.

3:08:10.080 --> 3:08:12.080
 Except philosophically deep.

3:08:12.080 --> 3:08:15.080
 I mean, he is, I guess, kind of philosophically deep too.

3:08:15.080 --> 3:08:21.460
 So for people who don't know GPT, GPT3, it's a language model that can do natural language

3:08:21.460 --> 3:08:22.460
 generation.

3:08:22.460 --> 3:08:27.600
 So you can give it a prompt and it can complete the rest of it, but it turns out that that

3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:35.800
 kind of prompt, it's not just complete the rest of it, it's generating like novel sounding

3:08:35.800 --> 3:08:40.760
 text and then you can apply that to generation of other kinds of stuff.

3:08:40.760 --> 3:08:47.800
 So these kinds of transformer based language models are really good at forming, at forming

3:08:47.800 --> 3:08:54.520
 deep representations of a particular space, like a medium, like language.

3:08:54.520 --> 3:08:58.560
 So you can then apply it to a specific subset of language like programming.

3:08:58.560 --> 3:09:03.520
 So you can have it learn the representation of the Python programming language and use

3:09:03.520 --> 3:09:10.560
 it to then generate syntactically and semantically correct programs.

3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:14.840
 So you can start to make progress on one of the hardest problems in computer science,

3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:16.120
 which is program synthesis.

3:09:16.120 --> 3:09:19.800
 How do you write programs that accomplish different tasks?

3:09:19.800 --> 3:09:29.040
 So what OpenAI Codex does is it generates those programs based on a prompt of some kind.

3:09:29.040 --> 3:09:30.840
 Usually you can do a natural language prompt.

3:09:30.840 --> 3:09:36.720
 So basically, as you do when you program, you write some comment, which serves the basic

3:09:36.720 --> 3:09:40.880
 documentation of the inputs and the outputs and the function of the particular set of

3:09:40.880 --> 3:09:43.560
 coding and it's able to generate that.

3:09:43.560 --> 3:09:51.320
 So here being is you can generate programs using machine learning, using neural networks.

3:09:51.320 --> 3:09:57.200
 Those programs operate on the boring old computer.

3:09:57.200 --> 3:10:01.840
 Can you generate programs that operate, this guy be a clever version of programs for this,

3:10:01.840 --> 3:10:05.880
 but can you write programs that operate on a computer?

3:10:05.880 --> 3:10:06.880
 Yep.

3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:08.680
 There's actually software out there right now.

3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:10.680
 We can go and do it.

3:10:10.680 --> 3:10:11.680
 Really?

3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:12.680
 Yeah.

3:10:12.680 --> 3:10:21.680
 It's rule based, but we have what we've done, inspired by Codex actually, is over the summer

3:10:21.680 --> 3:10:23.680
 I ran a little workshop.

3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:28.160
 Some of my groups thought this inspired idea that we should get a load of students and

3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:36.000
 ask them to manually collect data, to label chemical procedures into QIDL.

3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:41.200
 And we have a thing called synthreader, so there's a bunch of people doing this right

3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:47.480
 now, but they're doing it without abstraction and because we have an abstraction that's

3:10:47.480 --> 3:10:55.640
 implementable in the hardware, we've developed basically a chemical analog of Codex.

3:10:55.640 --> 3:10:59.960
 We say abstraction in the hardware, what do you mean?

3:10:59.960 --> 3:11:04.640
 So right now, a lot of people doing machine learning and reading chemistry and just saying,

3:11:04.640 --> 3:11:09.520
 oh, you've got these operations, ad shake, whatever he, but because they don't have a

3:11:09.520 --> 3:11:14.680
 uniform, I mean, it's a couple of groups doing it, competitors actually, and they're good,

3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:20.560
 very good, but they can't run that code automatically.

3:11:20.560 --> 3:11:30.080
 They are losing meaning and the really important thing that you have to do is generate context.

3:11:30.080 --> 3:11:36.080
 And so what we've learned to do with our abstraction is make sure we can pull the context out of

3:11:36.080 --> 3:11:37.080
 the text.

3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:43.080
 So can we take a chemical procedure and read it and generate our executable code?

3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:44.080
 Yes.

3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:47.920
 What's the hardest part about that whole pipeline from the initial text interpreting the initial

3:11:47.920 --> 3:11:54.320
 text of a paper, extracting the meaningful context and the meaningful chemical information

3:11:54.320 --> 3:12:00.760
 to then generating the program, to then running that program in the hardware?

3:12:00.760 --> 3:12:05.920
 What's the hardest part about that pipeline as we look towards a universal Turing computer?

3:12:05.920 --> 3:12:16.440
 So the hardest thing with the pipeline is that the software, the model gets confused

3:12:16.440 --> 3:12:18.360
 between some meanings, right?

3:12:18.360 --> 3:12:24.040
 So if chemists are very good at inventing words that aren't broken down, so I would,

3:12:24.040 --> 3:12:28.320
 the classic word that you would use for boiling something is called reflux.

3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:33.280
 So reflux is you would have a solvent in the round bottom flask, at reflux it would be

3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:39.040
 being going up the reflux condenser and coming down, but that term reflux to reflux could

3:12:39.040 --> 3:12:46.040
 be changed, you know, to people often make up words, new words, and then the software

3:12:46.040 --> 3:12:47.440
 can fall over.

3:12:47.440 --> 3:12:52.680
 But what we've been able to do is a bit like in Python, or any programming language, is

3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:55.200
 identify when things aren't matched.

3:12:55.200 --> 3:12:58.400
 So you present the code and you say this isn't matched, you may want to think about this

3:12:58.400 --> 3:13:02.720
 and then the user goes and says, oh, I mean reflux and just ticks a box and collects it.

3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:12.760
 So what the codex or the chemics does in this case is it suggests the first go and then

3:13:12.760 --> 3:13:14.160
 the chemist goes in and corrects it.

3:13:14.160 --> 3:13:20.720
 And I really want the chemist to correct it, because it's not safe, I believe, for to allow

3:13:20.720 --> 3:13:25.240
 AI to just read literature and generate code at this stage.

3:13:25.240 --> 3:13:33.680
 Because now you're having actual, by the way, chemics, nice, nice name.

3:13:33.680 --> 3:13:42.080
 So you are unlike, which is fascinating, we live in a fascinating moment in human history.

3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:52.080
 But yes, you're literally connecting AI to some physical and like it's building something

3:13:52.080 --> 3:13:53.560
 in the physical realm.

3:13:53.560 --> 3:13:54.560
 Yeah.

3:13:54.560 --> 3:14:02.040
 It's building in the space of chemistry that operates sort of invisibly.

3:14:02.040 --> 3:14:03.040
 Yeah.

3:14:03.040 --> 3:14:04.040
 Yeah.

3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:05.600
 I would say that's right.

3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:09.160
 And it's really important to understand those labeling schemes, right?

3:14:09.160 --> 3:14:13.640
 And one of the things I was never, I was always worried about the beginning that the abstraction

3:14:13.640 --> 3:14:15.560
 was going to fall over.

3:14:15.560 --> 3:14:18.320
 And the way we did it was just by brute force to start with.

3:14:18.320 --> 3:14:20.520
 We just kept reading the literature and saying, is there anything new?

3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:22.000
 Can we add a new rule in?

3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:25.600
 And actually, our QIDL language expand exploded.

3:14:25.600 --> 3:14:28.240
 There was so many extra things we had to keep adding.

3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:32.800
 And then I realized the primitives still were maintained and I could break them down again.

3:14:32.800 --> 3:14:35.000
 So we get it's pretty good.

3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:38.400
 I mean, there are problems, there are problems of, you know, interpreting any big sentence

3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:40.800
 and turning it into an actionable code.

3:14:40.800 --> 3:14:44.160
 And the codex is not without its problems, you can, you can crash it quite easily, right?

3:14:44.160 --> 3:14:45.680
 You can generate nonsense.

3:14:45.680 --> 3:14:47.600
 But boy, it's interesting.

3:14:47.600 --> 3:14:54.240
 I would love to learn to program now using codex, right, just hacking around, right?

3:14:54.240 --> 3:15:00.040
 And I wonder if chemists in the future will learn to do chemistry by just hacking around

3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:02.320
 with the system, writing in different things.

3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:06.400
 Because the key thing that we're doing with the chemistry is that where a lot of mathematical

3:15:06.400 --> 3:15:13.080
 chemistry went wrong is people, and I think Wolfram does this in Mathematica, he assumes

3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:17.640
 that chemistry is a reaction where atom A or molecule A reacts with molecule B to give

3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:20.840
 molecule C, that's not what chemistry is.

3:15:20.840 --> 3:15:27.920
 Chemistry is take, take some molecule, take a liquid or a solid, mix it up and heat it

3:15:27.920 --> 3:15:29.520
 and then extract it.

3:15:29.520 --> 3:15:35.520
 So the programming language is actually with respect to the process operations.

3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:41.440
 And if you flick in process space, not in chemical graph space, you unlock everything

3:15:41.440 --> 3:15:45.240
 because there's only a finite number of processes you need to do in chemistry.

3:15:45.240 --> 3:15:47.360
 And that, and that's reassuring.

3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:51.760
 And so, so we're in the middle of it, it's really exciting.

3:15:51.760 --> 3:15:54.960
 It's not, you know, the be all on the end or, and there is, I can say, errors that can

3:15:54.960 --> 3:15:59.320
 creep in one day, we might be able to do it without human interaction, you simulate it

3:15:59.320 --> 3:16:04.120
 and you'll know enough about the simulation that will it, the, you know, I'm the lab won't

3:16:04.120 --> 3:16:05.120
 catch fire.

3:16:05.120 --> 3:16:08.960
 But there are so many safety issues right now that we've got to really be very careful,

3:16:08.960 --> 3:16:13.000
 you know, protecting the user, protecting the environment, protecting misuse.

3:16:13.000 --> 3:16:16.880
 I mean, there's lots to discuss if you want to go down that route, because it's very,

3:16:16.880 --> 3:16:17.880
 very interesting.

3:16:17.880 --> 3:16:25.360
 You don't want Novachox being made or, or explosives being made or, or recreational drugs

3:16:25.360 --> 3:16:26.360
 being made.

3:16:26.360 --> 3:16:31.400
 But how do you stop a molecular biologist making a drug that's going to be important

3:16:31.400 --> 3:16:38.400
 for them looking at their, you know, particular assay on a bad actor trying to make methamphetamine?

3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:42.120
 I saw how you looked at me when you said, bad actor, but that's exactly what I'm going

3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:43.120
 to do.

3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:45.280
 I'm trying to get the details of this so I can be first.

3:16:45.280 --> 3:16:46.280
 Oh, don't worry.

3:16:46.280 --> 3:16:48.280
 We can protect you from yourself.

3:16:48.280 --> 3:16:49.280
 Okay.

3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:54.240
 I'm not sure that's true, but that statement gives me hope.

3:16:54.240 --> 3:17:02.120
 Does this ultimately excite you about the future or does it terrify you?

3:17:02.120 --> 3:17:07.240
 So let's, we mentioned that time is fundamental.

3:17:07.240 --> 3:17:14.440
 It seems like you're at the cutting edge of progress that will have to happen, that will

3:17:14.440 --> 3:17:18.920
 happen, that there's no stopping it.

3:17:18.920 --> 3:17:24.820
 And I, as we've been talking about, I see obviously a huge number of exciting possibilities.

3:17:24.820 --> 3:17:31.440
 So whenever you automate these kinds of things, just the world opens up.

3:17:31.440 --> 3:17:38.800
 It's like programming itself and the computer, a regular computer has created innumerable

3:17:38.800 --> 3:17:39.800
 applications.

3:17:39.800 --> 3:17:45.240
 It made the world better in so many dimensions and it created, of course, a lot of negative

3:17:45.240 --> 3:17:50.800
 things that we, for some reason, like the focus on using that very technology to tweet

3:17:50.800 --> 3:17:52.560
 about it.

3:17:52.560 --> 3:17:57.720
 But I think it made a much better world, but it created a lot of new dangers.

3:17:57.720 --> 3:18:08.400
 So maybe you can speak to when you have, when you kind of stand at the end of the road for

3:18:08.400 --> 3:18:15.760
 building a really solid, reliable, universal computer, what are the possibilities that

3:18:15.760 --> 3:18:16.760
 are positive?

3:18:16.760 --> 3:18:18.280
 What are the possibilities that are negative?

3:18:18.280 --> 3:18:20.720
 How can we minimize the chance of the negative?

3:18:20.720 --> 3:18:21.720
 Yeah.

3:18:21.720 --> 3:18:22.720
 That's a really good question.

3:18:22.720 --> 3:18:29.240
 But there's so many positive things from drug discovery, from supply chain stress, for

3:18:29.240 --> 3:18:32.720
 basically enabling chemists to basically build more productive in the lab, right?

3:18:32.720 --> 3:18:35.440
 Where the computer's not going to replace the chemist.

3:18:35.440 --> 3:18:37.480
 There's going to be a Moore's law of molecules, right?

3:18:37.480 --> 3:18:41.160
 There's going to be so many more molecules we can design, so many more diseases we can

3:18:41.160 --> 3:18:42.160
 cure.

3:18:42.160 --> 3:18:46.040
 So chemists in the lab, as researchers, that's better for science, so they can build a bunch

3:18:46.040 --> 3:18:50.400
 of, like they could do science at a much more accelerated pace.

3:18:50.400 --> 3:18:54.200
 So it's not just the development of drugs, it's actually like doing the basic understanding

3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:55.200
 of the science of drugs.

3:18:55.200 --> 3:18:58.960
 And the personalization, the cost of drugs right now, we're all living longer.

3:18:58.960 --> 3:19:02.400
 We're all having more and more, we know more about our genomic development.

3:19:02.400 --> 3:19:07.200
 We know about our, you know, our predetermination, and we might be able to, one dream I've got

3:19:07.200 --> 3:19:12.400
 is like, imagine, you know, you can work at your genome assistant tells you you're going

3:19:12.400 --> 3:19:17.560
 to get cancer in seven years time, and you have your personal computer that cooks up

3:19:17.560 --> 3:19:20.680
 the right molecule just for you to cure it, right?

3:19:20.680 --> 3:19:22.520
 That's a really positive idea.

3:19:22.520 --> 3:19:28.960
 The other thing is, is when drugs, so right now, I think it is absolutely outrageous that

3:19:28.960 --> 3:19:33.240
 not all of humanity has access to medicine.

3:19:33.240 --> 3:19:36.680
 And I think the computer might be able to change that fundamentally because it's will

3:19:36.680 --> 3:19:39.000
 disrupt the way things are manufactured.

3:19:39.000 --> 3:19:42.000
 So let's stop thinking about manufacturing in different factories.

3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:48.560
 Let's say that computers, clinical grade computers or drug grade computers will be in facilities

3:19:48.560 --> 3:19:54.080
 all around the world, and they can make things on demand as a function of the cost.

3:19:54.080 --> 3:19:57.600
 You know, maybe people won't be able to afford the latest and greatest patent, but maybe

3:19:57.600 --> 3:20:03.960
 they'll be able to get the next best thing and will basically democratize, make available

3:20:03.960 --> 3:20:09.640
 drugs to everybody that they need, you know, and you know, there's lots of really interesting

3:20:09.640 --> 3:20:10.640
 things there.

3:20:10.640 --> 3:20:12.480
 So I think that's going to happen.

3:20:12.480 --> 3:20:17.200
 I think that now let's take the negative.

3:20:17.200 --> 3:20:21.400
 Before we do that, let's imagine what happened to go back to a really tragic accident a few

3:20:21.400 --> 3:20:22.400
 years ago.

3:20:22.400 --> 3:20:27.040
 Well, not an accident, an act of murder by that pilot on the, I think it was Eurowings

3:20:27.040 --> 3:20:28.040
 or Swisswings.

3:20:28.040 --> 3:20:31.800
 But what he did is, the plane took off.

3:20:31.800 --> 3:20:35.840
 He waited till his pilot went to the toilet, he was a copilot, he locked the door and then

3:20:35.840 --> 3:20:44.280
 set the autopilot above the Alps, he set the altimeter or the descend height to zero.

3:20:44.280 --> 3:20:48.200
 So the computer just took the plane into the Alps.

3:20:48.200 --> 3:20:53.560
 Now, I mean, that was such a tragedy that obviously the guy was mentally ill, but it

3:20:53.560 --> 3:20:56.680
 wasn't just a tragedy for him, it was for all the people on board.

3:20:56.680 --> 3:21:03.120
 But what if, and I was inspired by this and I'm thinking, what can I do to do, to anticipate

3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:08.480
 problems like this in the computer, had the software, and I'm sure Boeing and Airbus will

3:21:08.480 --> 3:21:12.720
 be thinking, oh, maybe I can give the computer a bit more situational awareness.

3:21:12.720 --> 3:21:16.560
 So whenever one, some tries to drop the height of the plane and it knows it's above the

3:21:16.560 --> 3:21:20.600
 Alps or just say, oh no, computer says no, we're not letting you do that.

3:21:20.600 --> 3:21:23.840
 Of course he would have been out of find another way, maybe fly it until it runs out of fuel

3:21:23.840 --> 3:21:24.840
 or something.

3:21:24.840 --> 3:21:29.640
 But you know, keep anticipating all the large number of trajectories that can go negative,

3:21:29.640 --> 3:21:36.600
 all those kinds of running into the Alps and try to at least make it easy for the engineers

3:21:36.600 --> 3:21:38.800
 to build systems that are protecting us there.

3:21:38.800 --> 3:21:39.800
 Yeah.

3:21:39.800 --> 3:21:43.080
 And let's just think, what are in the computer world right now with KIDLs?

3:21:43.080 --> 3:21:45.080
 Let's just not think about what I'm doing right now.

3:21:45.080 --> 3:21:47.280
 What I'm doing right now is it's completely open, right?

3:21:47.280 --> 3:21:50.400
 Everyone's going to know KIDLs and be playing with them, making them more easier and easier

3:21:50.400 --> 3:21:51.400
 and easier.

3:21:51.400 --> 3:21:58.360
 But what we're going to start to do, it makes sense to encrypt the KIDLs in such a way you

3:21:58.360 --> 3:22:02.960
 will, let's say you work for a pharmaceutical company and you have a license to make a given

3:22:02.960 --> 3:22:03.960
 molecule.

3:22:03.960 --> 3:22:07.920
 Well, you get issued with a license by the FDA or your local authority and they'll say,

3:22:07.920 --> 3:22:09.200
 right, your license to do it.

3:22:09.200 --> 3:22:12.040
 Here it is, it's encrypted and the KIDL gets run.

3:22:12.040 --> 3:22:14.840
 So you have a license for that instance of use.

3:22:14.840 --> 3:22:15.840
 Easy to do.

3:22:15.840 --> 3:22:17.760
 Computer science has already solved the problem.

3:22:17.760 --> 3:22:23.080
 So the fact that we all trust online banking, right, the right now, then we can secure it.

3:22:23.080 --> 3:22:27.000
 I'm 100% sure we can secure the computer.

3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:32.760
 Because of the way we have a many, you know, it's like the same mapping problem that you,

3:22:32.760 --> 3:22:36.800
 to actually reverse engineer a KIDL will be as hard as reverse engineering the encryption

3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:44.520
 key, you know, brute force, it will be cheaper to just actually buy the regulated medicine.

3:22:44.520 --> 3:22:49.280
 And actually people aren't going to want to then make their own fake pharmaceuticals

3:22:49.280 --> 3:22:51.520
 because it'll be so cheap to do it.

3:22:51.520 --> 3:22:53.800
 We'll drop the cost of access to drugs.

3:22:53.800 --> 3:22:55.360
 Now what will happen?

3:22:55.360 --> 3:22:56.360
 Recreational drugs.

3:22:56.360 --> 3:22:59.240
 People will start saying, well, I want access to recreational drugs.

3:22:59.240 --> 3:23:04.040
 Well, it's going to be up to, it's going to accelerate that social discussion that's

3:23:04.040 --> 3:23:07.120
 happening in the US and Canada and the UK everywhere, right?

3:23:07.120 --> 3:23:10.520
 Because cost goes down, access goes up.

3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:15.480
 Given cannabis, THC, to some people have got epilepsy, these literally forgive the term

3:23:15.480 --> 3:23:20.440
 and no brainer because these poor people go from seizures like every day to maybe seizures

3:23:20.440 --> 3:23:22.080
 just once every few months.

3:23:22.080 --> 3:23:27.480
 So that's an interesting idea to try to minimize the chance that it can get into like the hands

3:23:27.480 --> 3:23:33.200
 of individuals like terrorists or people that want to do harm.

3:23:33.200 --> 3:23:39.240
 Now with that kind of thing, you're putting a lot of power in the hands of governments,

3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:40.560
 in the hands of institutions.

3:23:40.560 --> 3:23:46.840
 And so then emerge the kind of natural criticism you might have of governments that can sometimes

3:23:46.840 --> 3:23:54.880
 use these for ill, use them as weapons of war, not weapons, not tools of betterment.

3:23:54.880 --> 3:24:01.680
 So and sometimes not just war against other nations, but war against its own people as

3:24:01.680 --> 3:24:03.440
 it has been done throughout history.

3:24:03.440 --> 3:24:08.160
 Well, I'm thinking, so there's another way of doing it, a decentralized peer to peer

3:24:08.160 --> 3:24:13.160
 version where, and what you have to do, I'm not saying you should adopt a blockchain,

3:24:13.160 --> 3:24:16.400
 but there is a way of maybe taking Kyde L's and put them in blockchain.

3:24:16.400 --> 3:24:17.400
 That is an idea.

3:24:17.400 --> 3:24:21.160
 Let's just say the way we do it in my lab right now is we go to the literature, we take

3:24:21.160 --> 3:24:27.160
 a recipe to make a molecule, convert that to Kyde L and diligently make it in the robot

3:24:27.160 --> 3:24:29.160
 and validate it.

3:24:29.160 --> 3:24:34.240
 So I would call mining, proof of work, proof of synthesis, right?

3:24:34.240 --> 3:24:35.240
 Proof of synthesis.

3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:39.400
 Yeah, but this is cool because suddenly when you actually synthesize it, you can get the

3:24:39.400 --> 3:24:42.840
 analytical data, but there's also a fingerprint in there of the impurities that get carried

3:24:42.840 --> 3:24:46.600
 across because you can never make one something 100% pure.

3:24:46.600 --> 3:24:49.440
 That fingerprint will allow you to secure your Kyde L.

3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:51.560
 So what you do is encrypt those two things.

3:24:51.560 --> 3:24:57.080
 So suddenly you can have people out there mining and what you could do perhaps is do

3:24:57.080 --> 3:25:01.840
 the type of thing that we need to basically look at the way that contact tracing should

3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:05.600
 have been done in COVID where people are given the information.

3:25:05.600 --> 3:25:08.160
 So you've just been in contact with someone COVID.

3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:12.360
 You choose, I'm not telling you to stay at home, you choose, right?

3:25:12.360 --> 3:25:17.480
 And now if we could imagine a similar thing, like you have got access to these chemicals,

3:25:17.480 --> 3:25:22.080
 they will have these effects, you choose and publicize it, or maybe it's out somewhere.

3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:23.080
 I don't know.

3:25:23.080 --> 3:25:25.400
 I'm not a policymaker on this.

3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:31.240
 And my job here is to not just make the technology possible, but to have it as open as a discussion

3:25:31.240 --> 3:25:37.040
 as possible with people to say, hey, can we stop childhood mortality with this technology?

3:25:37.040 --> 3:25:42.600
 And do those benefits outweigh the one off where people might use it for terrorism or

3:25:42.600 --> 3:25:45.280
 people might use it for recreational drugs?

3:25:45.280 --> 3:25:49.760
 Chemify, which is the name of the entity that will make this happen, I think we have some

3:25:49.760 --> 3:25:54.680
 social responsibilities as an entity to make sure that we're not enabling people to manufacture

3:25:54.680 --> 3:25:56.880
 personal drugs, weapons at will.

3:25:56.880 --> 3:26:00.720
 And what we have to do is have a discussion with society, with the people that invest

3:26:00.720 --> 3:26:04.600
 in this, with people that are going to pay for this, to say, well, do you want to live

3:26:04.600 --> 3:26:07.800
 longer, and do you want to be healthier?

3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:09.680
 And are you willing to accept some of the risks?

3:26:09.680 --> 3:26:11.880
 And I think that's a discussion to have.

3:26:11.880 --> 3:26:16.160
 So by the way, when you say personal drugs, do you mean the illegal ones?

3:26:16.160 --> 3:26:22.320
 Or do you have a concern of just putting the manufacturer of any kind of legal drugs in

3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:29.240
 the hands of regular people because they might like dose matters, they might take way too

3:26:29.240 --> 3:26:30.240
 much?

3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:35.880
 And I would say, to be honest, the chances of computers being, well, should always never,

3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:39.600
 so the fact I can now say this means it's totally going to come true, right?

3:26:39.600 --> 3:26:41.080
 I'm going to do it.

3:26:41.080 --> 3:26:45.800
 I cannot imagine that computers will be in people's houses anytime soon, but they might

3:26:45.800 --> 3:26:53.040
 be at the local pharmacy, and if you've got a drug manufacturing facility in every town,

3:26:53.040 --> 3:26:56.160
 then you just go and they give you a prescription and they do it in such a way they format it

3:26:56.160 --> 3:26:59.440
 so that you don't have to take 10 pills every day.

3:26:59.440 --> 3:27:05.000
 You get one manufactured for you that has all the materials you need and the right distribution.

3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:06.000
 Got it.

3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:09.880
 But you mentioned recreation drugs and the reason I mentioned it because I know people

3:27:09.880 --> 3:27:12.080
 are going to speak up on this.

3:27:12.080 --> 3:27:17.360
 If the drug is legal, there's to me no reason why you can't manufacture it.

3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:18.360
 I mean, for recreation.

3:27:18.360 --> 3:27:19.360
 Yeah.

3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:20.360
 I mean, you can do it right now.

3:27:20.360 --> 3:27:22.560
 What do you have against the fund Lee?

3:27:22.560 --> 3:27:29.400
 I have, so I mean, I'm a chemistry professor in a university who's an entrepreneur as well.

3:27:29.400 --> 3:27:33.280
 I just think I need to be as responsible as I can in the discussion.

3:27:33.280 --> 3:27:34.280
 Sure.

3:27:34.280 --> 3:27:35.280
 Not sure, sure.

3:27:35.280 --> 3:27:40.160
 But I know, so let me be the one that says like, there's nothing, because you have said

3:27:40.160 --> 3:27:44.320
 recreational drugs and like terrorism in the same sentence.

3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:51.680
 I think let's make sure we draw a line that there's real dangers to the world of terrorists

3:27:51.680 --> 3:27:56.080
 of biowarfare, and then there's a little bit of weed.

3:27:56.080 --> 3:28:02.520
 So I have, I mean, I, I think it's up to the society to, to tell his governments what

3:28:02.520 --> 3:28:04.840
 it wants, what's acceptable, right?

3:28:04.840 --> 3:28:11.800
 And if it becomes, let's say that THC's become, you know, heavily acceptable and that you

3:28:11.800 --> 3:28:13.000
 can modify them.

3:28:13.000 --> 3:28:15.680
 So let's say there's, let's say it's like blood type.

3:28:15.680 --> 3:28:20.440
 There's a particular type of THC that you tolerate better than I do.

3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:21.440
 Then why not?

3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:23.080
 Why not have a machine that makes the one you like?

3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:24.080
 Yeah.

3:28:24.080 --> 3:28:25.080
 And then, and why not?

3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:26.080
 Brownie.

3:28:26.080 --> 3:28:29.720
 And I think that that's fine.

3:28:29.720 --> 3:28:33.760
 But I'm, you know, we're so far away from that, I can barely get the thing to work in

3:28:33.760 --> 3:28:34.760
 the lab, right?

3:28:34.760 --> 3:28:36.920
 And I mean, it's reliability and all this other stuff.

3:28:36.920 --> 3:28:42.000
 But what I think is going to happen in the short term, it's going to turbocharge molecular

3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:45.640
 discovery, reliability, and that will change the world.

3:28:45.640 --> 3:28:47.080
 That's super exciting.

3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:52.000
 You have a draft of a paper titled, autonomous intelligent exploration, discovery and optimization

3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:53.960
 of nanomaterials.

3:28:53.960 --> 3:28:58.960
 So we are talking about automating engineering of nanomaterials.

3:28:58.960 --> 3:29:01.440
 How hard is this problem?

3:29:01.440 --> 3:29:07.200
 And as we continue down this thread of the positives and the worrisome, what are the

3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:12.240
 things we should be excited about, and what are the things we should be terrified about

3:29:12.240 --> 3:29:18.160
 and how do we minimize the chance of the, of the terrifying consequences?

3:29:18.160 --> 3:29:21.480
 So in this robot, the robot does all the heavy lifting.

3:29:21.480 --> 3:29:24.440
 So the robot basically is an embodied AI.

3:29:24.440 --> 3:29:30.000
 I really, I really like AI is in, in a domain specific way.

3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:35.440
 One of the, as you should say at this point, there was an attempt in the 60s, Joshua Leddenberg

3:29:35.440 --> 3:29:40.840
 and some really important people did this that made an AI to try and guess if organic

3:29:40.840 --> 3:29:43.560
 molecules in a mass spectrometer were alien or not.

3:29:43.560 --> 3:29:44.560
 Yes.

3:29:44.560 --> 3:29:47.160
 And they, they failed because they didn't have assembly theory.

3:29:47.160 --> 3:29:48.160
 I see.

3:29:48.160 --> 3:29:53.360
 And when I, and I, wait, what does assembly theory give you about alien versus human life?

3:29:53.360 --> 3:29:56.560
 Well, no, it just, they, it tells you about unknown, the degree of unknowns.

3:29:56.560 --> 3:29:57.560
 You can fingerprint stuff.

3:29:57.560 --> 3:30:02.520
 They weren't looking at, they were trying to basically just look at the corpus of complex

3:30:02.520 --> 3:30:04.160
 organic molecules.

3:30:04.160 --> 3:30:07.440
 So I, when I was a bit down about assembly theory, because I couldn't, couldn't convince

3:30:07.440 --> 3:30:14.480
 referees and couldn't convince computational people interested in computational complexity.

3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:18.680
 I was really quite depressed about it and I mean, I've been working with, with Sarah

3:30:18.680 --> 3:30:23.240
 Walker's team and I think she, you know, I think she also invented in assembly theory

3:30:23.240 --> 3:30:25.320
 is somewhere we can talk about it later.

3:30:25.320 --> 3:30:32.800
 When I found the AI, not working for the Dendral project, I suddenly realized I wasn't

3:30:32.800 --> 3:30:34.920
 it totally insane.

3:30:34.920 --> 3:30:37.320
 Coming back to this nano robot.

3:30:37.320 --> 3:30:42.920
 So what it does is basically like a computer, but now what it does is it squirts a liquid

3:30:42.920 --> 3:30:50.600
 with gold in it in a test tube and it adds some reducing agents, those electrons to make

3:30:50.600 --> 3:30:53.320
 the gold turn into a nanoparticle.

3:30:53.320 --> 3:30:56.880
 Now when gold becomes a nanoparticle, it gets a characteristic color, a plasmon.

3:30:56.880 --> 3:31:01.320
 So it's a bit like if you look at the sheen on the gold wedding ring or gold bar or something,

3:31:01.320 --> 3:31:05.920
 there's, there's the ways of conducting electrons basically reflect light.

3:31:05.920 --> 3:31:10.440
 What we did is we randomly squirt the gold, the gold particle and the reducing agent in

3:31:10.440 --> 3:31:13.600
 and we measure the UV, we measure the color.

3:31:13.600 --> 3:31:16.960
 And so what we do is we've got the robot has a mind.

3:31:16.960 --> 3:31:23.880
 So it has a mind where in a simulation, it randomly generates nanoparticles and the plasmon,

3:31:23.880 --> 3:31:27.440
 the color that comes out randomly generate imagines in its head.

3:31:27.440 --> 3:31:30.480
 It then with the others, that's the imaginary side of the robot and the physical side of

3:31:30.480 --> 3:31:36.360
 the robot, it squirts in the chemicals and looks at the color and it uses a genetic algorithm

3:31:36.360 --> 3:31:43.880
 and a map elite actually on it and it goes around in cycles and refines the color to

3:31:43.880 --> 3:31:45.480
 the objective.

3:31:45.480 --> 3:31:46.800
 Now we use two different points.

3:31:46.800 --> 3:31:51.160
 We have an exploration and optimization, they're two different.

3:31:51.160 --> 3:31:55.560
 So the exploration just says, just do random stuff and see how many different things you

3:31:55.560 --> 3:31:56.560
 can get.

3:31:56.560 --> 3:32:00.280
 And when you get different things, try and optimize and make the peak sharper, sharper,

3:32:00.280 --> 3:32:01.280
 sharper.

3:32:01.280 --> 3:32:06.200
 And what it does after a number of cycles is it physically takes a sample of the optimized

3:32:06.200 --> 3:32:12.640
 nanomaterial, resets all the round bottom flasks, cleans them, and puts the seed, physical

3:32:12.640 --> 3:32:14.040
 seed back in.

3:32:14.040 --> 3:32:20.520
 And what this robot is able to do is search a space of 10 to the 23 possible reactions

3:32:20.520 --> 3:32:24.240
 in just a thousand experiments in three days.

3:32:24.240 --> 3:32:28.440
 And it makes five generations of nanoparticles which get nicer and nicer in terms of shape

3:32:28.440 --> 3:32:30.240
 and color and definition.

3:32:30.240 --> 3:32:34.080
 And then at the end, it outputs a Kydeo code that could then be...

3:32:34.080 --> 3:32:39.840
 Wow, it's doing the search for programs in the physical space.

3:32:39.840 --> 3:32:46.280
 So it's doing a kind of reinforcement learning with the exploration and the optimization.

3:32:46.280 --> 3:32:49.720
 And that Kydeo will work on any computer or any qualified hardware.

3:32:49.720 --> 3:32:51.640
 So now that's it.

3:32:51.640 --> 3:32:58.120
 Now that's a general piece of code that can replicate somewhat, maybe perfectly what

3:32:58.120 --> 3:32:59.120
 it created.

3:32:59.120 --> 3:33:00.120
 That's amazing.

3:33:00.120 --> 3:33:01.120
 That's incredible.

3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:02.240
 But the nanoparticles themselves are dumb.

3:33:02.240 --> 3:33:06.880
 The robot has all the thinking, so we don't try and imply any self replication or try

3:33:06.880 --> 3:33:11.600
 and get the particles to make themselves, although it would be cool to try.

3:33:11.600 --> 3:33:13.600
 So well, there you go.

3:33:13.600 --> 3:33:17.960
 That those are famous last words for the end of human civilization would be cool to try.

3:33:17.960 --> 3:33:25.560
 So is it possible to create molecules that start approaching this question that we started

3:33:25.560 --> 3:33:32.440
 this conversation, which is the origin of life, to start to create molecules that have

3:33:32.440 --> 3:33:34.200
 lifelike qualities.

3:33:34.200 --> 3:33:40.200
 So have the replication, have like complex, start to create complex organisms.

3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:41.960
 So we have done this with the oxides.

3:33:41.960 --> 3:33:46.000
 I talked about earlier, they've lived in the oxides and the rings and the bulls.

3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:52.040
 And the problem is that what they do, they autocatalytically enhance one another.

3:33:52.040 --> 3:33:58.920
 So they would, I guess you would call it self replication, but because there's limited

3:33:58.920 --> 3:34:02.800
 function and mutation, they're pretty dumb.

3:34:02.800 --> 3:34:04.720
 So don't do very much.

3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:13.400
 So I think the prospect of us being able to engineer a nanomaterial life form in the short

3:34:13.400 --> 3:34:17.440
 term, like I said earlier, my aim is to do this, of course, I mean, I'm, you know, on

3:34:17.440 --> 3:34:18.440
 one hand, I'm saying it's impossible.

3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:19.600
 On the other hand, I'm saying I'm doing it.

3:34:19.600 --> 3:34:20.600
 So which is it, Lee?

3:34:20.600 --> 3:34:25.040
 It's like, well, I think we can do it, but only in the robot.

3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:27.760
 So the causal chain that's going to allow it is in the robot.

3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:32.360
 These particles, if they do start to self replicate, the system's going to be so fragile that

3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:36.000
 I don't think anything dangerous will come out.

3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:41.600
 It doesn't mean we shouldn't treat them as potentially, you know, I mean, I don't want

3:34:41.600 --> 3:34:45.280
 to scare people like gain of function, we're going to produce stuff that comes out.

3:34:45.280 --> 3:34:53.440
 Our number one kill switch is that we always try to search a space of objects that don't

3:34:53.440 --> 3:34:55.880
 exist in the environment.

3:34:55.880 --> 3:34:58.640
 So even if something got out, it just would die immediately.

3:34:58.640 --> 3:35:02.240
 It's like making a silicon life form or something or, you know,

3:35:02.240 --> 3:35:06.480
 Which is the opposite of oftentimes gain of function research just focused on like, how

3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:11.800
 do you get a dangerous thing to be closer to something that works with humans?

3:35:11.800 --> 3:35:12.800
 Yeah.

3:35:12.800 --> 3:35:13.800
 So have it jump to humans.

3:35:13.800 --> 3:35:21.560
 That's the one, that's the one good mode to operate on is always try to operate on chemical

3:35:21.560 --> 3:35:25.600
 entities that are very different than the, the kind of chemical environment that humans

3:35:25.600 --> 3:35:26.600
 operate in.

3:35:26.600 --> 3:35:27.600
 Yeah.

3:35:27.600 --> 3:35:33.360
 And also, I mean, I'll say something dramatic, which may not be, may not be true.

3:35:33.360 --> 3:35:35.320
 So I should be careful.

3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:42.960
 If let's say we did discover a new living system that it was made out of a shadow biosphere

3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:45.440
 and we just released it in the environment, who cares?

3:35:45.440 --> 3:35:47.240
 It's going to use different stuff.

3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:49.240
 It'll just live.

3:35:49.240 --> 3:35:50.240
 Just live.

3:35:50.240 --> 3:35:51.240
 Yeah.

3:35:51.240 --> 3:35:56.840
 I, I found one of my biggest fantasies is actually is like a planet that's basically half in

3:35:56.840 --> 3:35:57.840
 the sun.

3:35:57.840 --> 3:35:58.840
 It doesn't rotate, right?

3:35:58.840 --> 3:36:03.960
 And, and you have two different origins of life on that planet and they don't share

3:36:03.960 --> 3:36:04.960
 the same chemistry.

3:36:04.960 --> 3:36:05.960
 Yeah.

3:36:05.960 --> 3:36:08.960
 And then the only way time they recognize each other is when they become intelligent.

3:36:08.960 --> 3:36:10.840
 They go, well, what's that moving?

3:36:10.840 --> 3:36:11.840
 Yeah.

3:36:11.840 --> 3:36:14.640
 So they, they co evolved and that's fascinating.

3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:19.680
 I mean, so one fascinating thing to do is exactly what you were saying, which is a life

3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:29.800
 bomb, which is like try to focus on atmospheres or chemical conditions of other planets and

3:36:29.800 --> 3:36:40.720
 try within this kind of exploration optimization system, try to discover life forms that can

3:36:40.720 --> 3:36:45.320
 work in those conditions and then you send those life forms over there and see what kind

3:36:45.320 --> 3:36:46.440
 of stuff they build up.

3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:52.320
 Like you can do like a large scale, it's kind of a safe physical environment to do large

3:36:52.320 --> 3:36:53.320
 scale experiments.

3:36:53.320 --> 3:36:54.320
 It's another planet.

3:36:54.320 --> 3:36:55.320
 Yeah.

3:36:55.320 --> 3:36:57.200
 So look, I'm going to say something quite contentious.

3:36:57.200 --> 3:36:58.960
 I mean, Elon wants to go to Mars.

3:36:58.960 --> 3:37:03.080
 I think it's brilliant wants to go to Mars, but I would counter that and say, is Elon

3:37:03.080 --> 3:37:08.200
 just obsessed with getting humanity off Earth or what about just technology?

3:37:08.200 --> 3:37:09.360
 So we do technology.

3:37:09.360 --> 3:37:12.960
 So, so Elon, I don't need to take a computer to Mars because he needs to manufacture drugs

3:37:12.960 --> 3:37:14.160
 right on demand, right?

3:37:14.160 --> 3:37:17.240
 Cause you zero cost payload and all that stuff is just code.

3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:22.040
 Or what we do is we actually say, hang on, it's quite hard for humans to survive on

3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:23.040
 Mars.

3:37:23.040 --> 3:37:27.160
 Why don't we write a series of origin life algorithms where we put our, embed our culture

3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:28.160
 in it, right?

3:37:28.160 --> 3:37:29.840
 It's a very Ridley spot, Prometheus, right?

3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:30.840
 Yeah.

3:37:30.840 --> 3:37:37.400
 Which is a terrible film by the way, but anyway, and dump it on Mars and just terraform Mars.

3:37:37.400 --> 3:37:42.760
 And what we do is we evolve life on Mars that is suited to life on Mars rather than brute

3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:44.760
 forcing human life on Mars.

3:37:44.760 --> 3:37:48.680
 So one of the questions is, you know, what, what is human culture?

3:37:48.680 --> 3:37:50.360
 What are the things you encode?

3:37:50.360 --> 3:37:51.360
 Some of it is knowledge.

3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:52.920
 Some of it is information.

3:37:52.920 --> 3:37:58.280
 But the thing that Elon talks about and the thing I think about, I think you think about

3:37:58.280 --> 3:38:06.960
 as well as some of the more unique aspects of human nature of what makes us human, which

3:38:06.960 --> 3:38:09.840
 is our particular kind of consciousness.

3:38:09.840 --> 3:38:12.800
 So he talks about the flame of human consciousness.

3:38:12.800 --> 3:38:13.800
 Yeah.

3:38:13.800 --> 3:38:22.320
 That's one of the questions is, can we instill consciousness into other beings?

3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:28.520
 Because that's a sad thought that whatever this thing inside our minds that hopes and

3:38:28.520 --> 3:38:33.400
 dreams and fears and loves can all die.

3:38:33.400 --> 3:38:34.400
 Yeah.

3:38:34.400 --> 3:38:37.480
 But I think you already know the answer to that question.

3:38:37.480 --> 3:38:40.240
 I have a robot lawn mower at home.

3:38:40.240 --> 3:38:42.480
 My kids call it CC call cutter.

3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:44.800
 It's a robot mow.

3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:48.800
 And it, the way it works, it has an electric field around the perimeter and it just tell

3:38:48.800 --> 3:38:54.440
 it the area and it goes out and goes from its base station, just mows a bit, gets to

3:38:54.440 --> 3:38:59.160
 the perimeter, detects perimeter, then chooses a random angle, rotates around and goes on.

3:38:59.160 --> 3:39:00.160
 Yeah.

3:39:00.160 --> 3:39:02.120
 But my kids call it cool cutter.

3:39:02.120 --> 3:39:03.120
 It's a she.

3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:04.120
 I don't know why it's a she.

3:39:04.120 --> 3:39:05.440
 They just, they were, they were like quite young.

3:39:05.440 --> 3:39:08.360
 They called it, I don't want to be sexist there.

3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:11.920
 It could be a he, but they liked.

3:39:11.920 --> 3:39:13.160
 They gendered the lawn mower.

3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:14.160
 They gendered the lawn mower.

3:39:14.160 --> 3:39:15.160
 Okay.

3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:16.160
 Yeah.

3:39:16.160 --> 3:39:17.160
 Why not?

3:39:17.160 --> 3:39:22.760
 Well, if you apply integrated information theory to lawn mower, lawn mower is conscious.

3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:27.720
 Now information, integrated information theory is that people say it's a flawed way of measuring

3:39:27.720 --> 3:39:29.040
 consciousness, but I don't think it is.

3:39:29.040 --> 3:39:33.800
 I think assembly theory actually measures consciousness in the same way.

3:39:33.800 --> 3:39:39.360
 Consciousness is something that has generated over a population of objects of humans.

3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:41.160
 Consciousness didn't suddenly spring in.

3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:43.280
 Our consciousness is evolved together, right?

3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:47.120
 The fact we're here and the robots we leave behind, they all have some of that.

3:39:47.120 --> 3:39:48.920
 So we won't lose it all.

3:39:48.920 --> 3:39:52.680
 Sure, consciousness requires that we have many models being generated.

3:39:52.680 --> 3:39:54.960
 It's not just one domain specific AI, right?

3:39:54.960 --> 3:39:59.120
 I think the way it creates consciousness, I'm going to say unashainably the best way

3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:04.440
 to make a consciousness is in a chemical system because you just have access to many more

3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:05.440
 states.

3:40:05.440 --> 3:40:09.120
 And the problem right now, we're making silicon consciousness because you just don't have

3:40:09.120 --> 3:40:10.960
 enough states.

3:40:10.960 --> 3:40:14.920
 So there are more possible states, or sorry, there are more possible configurations possible

3:40:14.920 --> 3:40:18.040
 in your brain than there are atoms in the universe.

3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:20.520
 And you can switch between them.

3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:22.200
 You can't do that on a Core i10.

3:40:22.200 --> 3:40:26.960
 It's got 10 billion, 12 billion, 14 billion transistors, but you can't reconfigure them

3:40:26.960 --> 3:40:27.960
 as dynamically.

3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:34.360
 Well, you've shared this intuition a few times already that the larger number of states

3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:41.280
 somehow correlates to greater possibility of life, but it's also possible the constraints

3:40:41.280 --> 3:40:42.600
 are essential here.

3:40:42.600 --> 3:40:43.600
 Yeah.

3:40:43.600 --> 3:40:48.720
 I mean, but coming back to the, you worry that something's lost, I agree.

3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:56.600
 But I think that, you know, we will get to an AGI, but I wonder if it's not, it can't

3:40:56.600 --> 3:41:00.920
 be separate from human, it can't be separate from human consciousness because the causal

3:41:00.920 --> 3:41:03.120
 chain that produced it came from humans.

3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:09.720
 So what I kind of try and suggest heavily to people worry about the existential threat

3:41:09.720 --> 3:41:15.000
 of AI saying, I mean, you put it much more elegantly earlier, like we should worry about

3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:21.160
 algorithms on dumb algorithms written by human beings on Twitter, driving us insane, right?

3:41:21.160 --> 3:41:22.880
 And doing acting in odd ways.

3:41:22.880 --> 3:41:23.880
 Yeah.

3:41:23.880 --> 3:41:24.880
 I think intelligence.

3:41:24.880 --> 3:41:32.560
 This is what I have been in eloquent in trying to describe it partially because I try not

3:41:32.560 --> 3:41:37.160
 to think too deeply through this stuff because then you become a philosopher, I still aspire

3:41:37.160 --> 3:41:46.960
 to actually building a bunch of stuff, but my sense is superintelligence leads to deep

3:41:46.960 --> 3:41:48.800
 integration into human society.

3:41:48.800 --> 3:41:55.600
 So like intelligence is strongly correlated, like intelligence, the way we conceive of

3:41:55.600 --> 3:42:05.520
 intelligence materializes as a thing that becomes a fun entity to have at a party with

3:42:05.520 --> 3:42:06.520
 humans.

3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:12.000
 I feel like it's a mix of wit, intelligence, humor, like intelligence, like knowledge,

3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:18.520
 ability to do reasoning and so on, but also humor, emotional intelligence, ability to

3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:28.360
 love, to dream, to share those dreams, to play the game of human civilization, the push

3:42:28.360 --> 3:42:31.520
 and pull, the whole dance of it, the whole dance of life.

3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:38.080
 And I think that kind of superintelligent being is not the thing that worries me.

3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:41.200
 I think that ultimately will enrich life.

3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:46.440
 It's again, the dumb algorithms, the dumb algorithms that scale in the hands of people

3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:52.000
 that are too, don't study history, that don't study human psychology and human nature, just

3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:57.120
 applying too broadly for selfish near term interests.

3:42:57.120 --> 3:42:58.120
 That's the biggest danger.

3:42:58.120 --> 3:42:59.120
 Yeah.

3:42:59.120 --> 3:43:00.640
 I think it's not a new danger, right?

3:43:00.640 --> 3:43:01.480
 Right.

3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:07.400
 We now know how I should use Twitter and how I shouldn't use Twitter, right?

3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:09.480
 I like to provoke people into thinking.

3:43:09.480 --> 3:43:11.560
 I don't want to provoke people into outrage.

3:43:11.560 --> 3:43:12.560
 It's not fun.

3:43:12.560 --> 3:43:14.760
 It's not a good thing for humans to do, right?

3:43:14.760 --> 3:43:19.320
 And I think that when you get people into outrage, they take sides and taking sides is

3:43:19.320 --> 3:43:20.320
 really bad.

3:43:20.320 --> 3:43:24.680
 But I think that we're all beginning to see this and I think that actually I'm very optimistic

3:43:24.680 --> 3:43:32.320
 about how things will evolve because I wonder how much productivity has Twitter and social

3:43:32.320 --> 3:43:37.600
 media taken out of humanity because how many now, I mean, so the good thing about Twitter

3:43:37.600 --> 3:43:41.880
 is it gives power, so it gives voice to minorities, right?

3:43:41.880 --> 3:43:44.360
 And that's good in some degree.

3:43:44.360 --> 3:43:53.240
 But I wonder how much voice does it give to all sorts of other problems that don't need

3:43:53.240 --> 3:43:54.240
 this emerge?

3:43:54.240 --> 3:44:00.080
 By the way, when you say minorities, I think, or at least if I were to agree with you, what

3:44:00.080 --> 3:44:09.520
 I would say is minorities broadly defined in these small groups of people that it magnifies

3:44:09.520 --> 3:44:13.000
 the concerns of the small versus the big.

3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:18.480
 That is good to some degree, but I think, I mean, I have to be careful because I think

3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:23.360
 I have a very, I mean, I think that the world isn't that broken, right?

3:44:23.360 --> 3:44:25.040
 I think the world is pretty cool place.

3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:26.920
 I think academia is really great.

3:44:26.920 --> 3:44:33.440
 I think climate change presents a really interesting problem for humanity that we will solve.

3:44:33.440 --> 3:44:37.600
 I like how you said it's a pretty cool problem for civilization.

3:44:37.600 --> 3:44:38.600
 It's a big one.

3:44:38.600 --> 3:44:39.600
 What is the budget?

3:44:39.600 --> 3:44:40.600
 I want to...

3:44:40.600 --> 3:44:45.960
 There's a bunch of really, really big problems that if solved can significantly improve the

3:44:45.960 --> 3:44:47.680
 quality of life or large...

3:44:47.680 --> 3:44:52.360
 That ultimately is what we're trying to do, improve like how awesome life is for the maximum

3:44:52.360 --> 3:44:53.360
 number of people.

3:44:53.360 --> 3:44:54.360
 Yeah.

3:44:54.360 --> 3:44:59.320
 And I think that the coming back to consciousness, I don't think the universe is doomed to heat

3:44:59.320 --> 3:45:00.320
 death, right?

3:45:00.320 --> 3:45:01.560
 It's one of the optimists.

3:45:01.560 --> 3:45:04.840
 That's why I want to kind of nudge you into thinking that time is fundamental because

3:45:04.840 --> 3:45:09.720
 if time is fundamental, then suddenly, you don't have to give it back.

3:45:09.720 --> 3:45:13.240
 The universe just constructs stuff, you know, and what we see around us in our construction,

3:45:13.240 --> 3:45:16.160
 I know everyone's worried about how fragile civilization is.

3:45:16.160 --> 3:45:22.240
 I mean, look at the fundamentals, we're good until the sun expands, right?

3:45:22.240 --> 3:45:23.920
 We've got quite a lot of resource on earth.

3:45:23.920 --> 3:45:26.080
 We're trying to be quite cooperative.

3:45:26.080 --> 3:45:31.960
 Humans are nice to each other when they're not under enormous stress.

3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:36.600
 But coming back to the consciousness thing, are we going to send human beings to Mars

3:45:36.600 --> 3:45:41.760
 or conscious robots to Mars or are we going to send some hybrid?

3:45:41.760 --> 3:45:43.280
 And I don't know the answer to that question right now.

3:45:43.280 --> 3:45:46.480
 I guess, you know, Elon's going to have a pretty good going there.

3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:53.560
 I'm not sure whether I have my doubts, but I'm not qualified, you know, I'm sure people

3:45:53.560 --> 3:45:59.440
 have their doubts that computation works, but I've got it working and I, you know.

3:45:59.440 --> 3:46:07.320
 And most of the cool technologies we have today and take for granted, like the airplane,

3:46:07.320 --> 3:46:13.080
 aforementioned airplane, were things that people doubted, like majority of people doubted

3:46:13.080 --> 3:46:16.200
 before they came to life and they come to life.

3:46:16.200 --> 3:46:20.960
 And speaking of hybrid AI and humans, it's fascinating to think about all the different

3:46:20.960 --> 3:46:25.080
 ways that hybridization, that merger can happen.

3:46:25.080 --> 3:46:28.840
 I mean, we have, currently have a smartphone, so there's already a hybrid, but there's

3:46:28.840 --> 3:46:34.520
 all kinds of ways that hybrid happens, how we and other technology play together, like

3:46:34.520 --> 3:46:40.880
 a computer, how that changes the fabric of human civilization is like wide open.

3:46:40.880 --> 3:46:41.880
 Who knows?

3:46:41.880 --> 3:46:54.360
 Who knows, if you remove cancer, if you remove major diseases from humanity, there's going

3:46:54.360 --> 3:46:57.440
 to be a bunch of consequences we're not anticipating.

3:46:57.440 --> 3:47:04.280
 Many of them positive, but many of them negative, many of them, most of them, at least I hope,

3:47:04.280 --> 3:47:08.960
 are weird and wonderful and fun in ways that are totally unexpected.

3:47:08.960 --> 3:47:14.080
 And we sitting on a porch with a bottle of Jack Daniels and a rock, we'll see kids these

3:47:14.080 --> 3:47:17.240
 days don't appreciate how hard we had it back in the day.

3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:25.200
 I got to ask you, speaking of nudging, you and Yosha Bach nudge each other on Twitter

3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:29.600
 quite a bit in wonderful intellectual debates.

3:47:29.600 --> 3:47:33.680
 And of course, for people who don't know, Yosha Bach, he's been on the podcast a couple

3:47:33.680 --> 3:47:41.000
 of times, he tweeted, or he tweeted, Yosha Bach, everyone should follow him as well.

3:47:41.000 --> 3:47:46.000
 You should definitely follow Mr. Lee Cronin, Dr. Lee Cronin.

3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:51.440
 He tweeted, dinner with Lee Cronin, we discussed that while we can translate every working

3:47:51.440 --> 3:47:56.680
 model of existence into a Turing machine, the structure of the universe might be given

3:47:56.680 --> 3:48:03.200
 by wakes of nonexistence in a pattern generated by all possible automata, which exists by

3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:05.920
 default.

3:48:05.920 --> 3:48:10.000
 And then he followed on saying face to face is the best.

3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:12.280
 So the dinner was face to face.

3:48:12.280 --> 3:48:19.720
 What is Yosha talking about in wakes, quote, wakes of nonexistence in a pattern generated

3:48:19.720 --> 3:48:25.600
 by all possible automata, which exists by default.

3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:29.880
 So automata exists by default, apparently.

3:48:29.880 --> 3:48:35.120
 And then there's wakes of nonexistence, what the hell is nonexistence in the universe?

3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:42.800
 That's a top, that's, and also in another conversation, you tweeted, it's state machines

3:48:42.800 --> 3:48:47.920
 all the way down, which presumably is the origin story of this discussion.

3:48:47.920 --> 3:48:56.600
 And then Yosha said, again, nudging, nudging, nudging slash trolling, Yosha said, you've

3:48:56.600 --> 3:49:02.240
 seen the light, welcome friend, many foundational physicists effectively believe in some form

3:49:02.240 --> 3:49:07.320
 of hypercomputation, Lee is coming around to this idea.

3:49:07.320 --> 3:49:10.520
 And then you said, I think there are notable differences.

3:49:10.520 --> 3:49:13.640
 First I think the universe does not have to be a computer.

3:49:13.640 --> 3:49:18.520
 Second, I want to understand how the universe emerges, constructors that build computers.

3:49:18.520 --> 3:49:24.600
 And third, is that there is something below church Turing.

3:49:24.600 --> 3:49:31.040
 Okay, what the heck is this dinner conversation about?

3:49:31.040 --> 3:49:34.760
 Maybe put another way, maybe zooming out a little bit.

3:49:34.760 --> 3:49:41.520
 Are there interesting agreements or disagreements between Ewan and Joshua Bach that can elucidate

3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:43.880
 some of the other topics we've been talking about?

3:49:43.880 --> 3:49:44.880
 Yeah.

3:49:44.880 --> 3:49:52.640
 So Yash has an incredible mind and he has, he's so well read and uses language really

3:49:52.640 --> 3:49:54.880
 elegantly, it bamboozles me at times.

3:49:54.880 --> 3:50:02.520
 So I'm, so often I'm using, I'm describing concepts in a way that I built from the ground

3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:03.520
 up.

3:50:03.520 --> 3:50:05.200
 And so we misunderstand each other a lot.

3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:08.400
 And he's floating in the clouds, is that what you're saying?

3:50:08.400 --> 3:50:11.680
 Something like, not quite, but I think so, there's concept of a Turing machine.

3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:18.120
 So a Turing machine, Turing machines, I would argue, and I think this is not the Turing

3:50:18.120 --> 3:50:21.520
 machine, the universe is not a Turing machine.

3:50:21.520 --> 3:50:23.400
 Technology is not even a Turing machine, right?

3:50:23.400 --> 3:50:27.080
 And because Turing machines don't evolve, right, there's a, there is this problem that

3:50:27.080 --> 3:50:31.040
 people see Turing machines everywhere, but is an interest in the universe gave rise to

3:50:31.040 --> 3:50:35.120
 biology that gave rise to intelligence that gave rise to Alan Turing, who invented the

3:50:35.120 --> 3:50:40.720
 abstraction of the Turing machine and allowed us to digitize.

3:50:40.720 --> 3:50:45.400
 And so I've been looking for the mystery at the origin of life, the origin of intelligence

3:50:45.400 --> 3:50:46.480
 and the origin of this.

3:50:46.480 --> 3:50:51.320
 And I, when I discussed with Yasha, I think Yasha, he was saying, well, the universe of

3:50:51.320 --> 3:50:55.160
 course, the universe is a Turing machine, of course, there's a, there's a hyper computer

3:50:55.160 --> 3:50:56.160
 there.

3:50:56.160 --> 3:51:01.240
 And I think we got kind of trapped in our words and terms, because of course, it's possible

3:51:01.240 --> 3:51:04.280
 for a Turing machine or computers to exist in the universe.

3:51:04.280 --> 3:51:05.280
 We have them.

3:51:05.280 --> 3:51:09.960
 But what I'm trying to understand is, where did the transition of continuous to discreet

3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:10.960
 occur?

3:51:10.960 --> 3:51:18.240
 And I've been, and this is because of my, my general foolishness of understanding the

3:51:18.240 --> 3:51:19.680
 continuous.

3:51:19.680 --> 3:51:27.040
 And I guess what I'm trying to say is, there were constructors before there were abstractors.

3:51:27.040 --> 3:51:31.640
 Because how did the universe abstract itself into existence?

3:51:31.640 --> 3:51:35.360
 And it goes back to earlier saying, could the universe of intelligence have come first?

3:51:35.360 --> 3:51:36.360
 What's a constructor?

3:51:36.360 --> 3:51:37.360
 What's an abstractor?

3:51:37.360 --> 3:51:43.920
 So the abstractor is the ability of say, of Alan Turing and Goodall and very, and, and

3:51:43.920 --> 3:51:50.880
 church to, to think about the mathematical universe and to label things.

3:51:50.880 --> 3:51:57.000
 And then from those labels to come up with a set of axioms with those labels and to basically

3:51:57.000 --> 3:52:01.520
 understand the universe mathematically and say, okay, I can label things, but where did

3:52:01.520 --> 3:52:03.280
 the labeler come from?

3:52:03.280 --> 3:52:05.080
 Where is the prime labeler?

3:52:05.080 --> 3:52:14.400
 Even if the universe is not a Turing computer, does that negate the possibility that a Turing

3:52:14.400 --> 3:52:16.360
 computer can simulate the universe?

3:52:16.360 --> 3:52:22.720
 Like just because the abstraction was formed at a later time, does that mean that abstraction,

3:52:22.720 --> 3:52:25.360
 this is to our cellular automata conversation.

3:52:25.360 --> 3:52:29.320
 You were taking away some of the magic from the cellular automata because very intelligent

3:52:29.320 --> 3:52:32.440
 biological systems came up with that cellular automata.

3:52:32.440 --> 3:52:36.320
 So this is where the existence is the default, right, is it does the fact that we exist and

3:52:36.320 --> 3:52:38.160
 we can come up with a Turing machine.

3:52:38.160 --> 3:52:42.080
 Does that mean the universe has to be a Turing machine as well?

3:52:42.080 --> 3:52:44.200
 But can it be a Turing machine though?

3:52:44.200 --> 3:52:47.080
 That's a, there has to be in a canopy.

3:52:47.080 --> 3:52:48.080
 Can it be?

3:52:48.080 --> 3:52:49.080
 Sure.

3:52:49.080 --> 3:52:50.880
 Um, I don't know.

3:52:50.880 --> 3:52:57.240
 I don't understand if it has to be or not, can it be, but can the universe have Turing

3:52:57.240 --> 3:52:58.240
 machines in it?

3:52:58.240 --> 3:52:59.240
 Sure.

3:52:59.240 --> 3:53:01.000
 They do exist now.

3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:07.520
 I'm wondering though, maybe, and this is, this is Ren, if things get really hairy, is

3:53:07.520 --> 3:53:12.800
 I think the universe maybe in the past did not have the computational power that it has

3:53:12.800 --> 3:53:18.000
 now.

3:53:18.000 --> 3:53:27.200
 This is almost like a law of physics kind of it's, so the computational power is not,

3:53:27.200 --> 3:53:28.600
 you can get some free lunch.

3:53:28.600 --> 3:53:29.600
 Yeah.

3:53:29.600 --> 3:53:33.440
 But the fact that we now, we sit here in this period in time and we can imagine all these

3:53:33.440 --> 3:53:36.200
 robots and all these machines and we built them.

3:53:36.200 --> 3:53:39.680
 And so we can easily imagine going back in time that the universe was capable of having

3:53:39.680 --> 3:53:42.040
 them, but I don't think it can.

3:53:42.040 --> 3:53:45.400
 So the universe may have been a lot dumber computationally.

3:53:45.400 --> 3:53:48.880
 And I think that's why I don't want to go back to the time discussion, but I think it

3:53:48.880 --> 3:53:50.800
 has some relationship with it.

3:53:50.800 --> 3:53:54.520
 The universe is basically smarter now than it used to be and it's going to continue getting

3:53:54.520 --> 3:54:01.520
 smarter over time because of novelty generation and the ability to create objects within objects

3:54:01.520 --> 3:54:02.520
 within objects.

3:54:02.520 --> 3:54:07.880
 You know, there's a, perhaps it's grounded in physics, there's intuition of conservation

3:54:07.880 --> 3:54:13.840
 that stuff is conserved like, like you're not, you've always had all everything, you're

3:54:13.840 --> 3:54:18.680
 just rearranging books on the bookshelf through time.

3:54:18.680 --> 3:54:21.840
 So you're saying like new books are being written.

3:54:21.840 --> 3:54:23.120
 Which laws you want to break?

3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:27.560
 The origin of the origin of the Big Bang, you had to break the second law because we

3:54:27.560 --> 3:54:28.560
 got order for free.

3:54:28.560 --> 3:54:29.560
 Yeah.

3:54:29.560 --> 3:54:32.720
 Well, what I'm telling you now is that the energy isn't conserved in the universe.

3:54:32.720 --> 3:54:34.600
 Oh, it's the second law.

3:54:34.600 --> 3:54:35.600
 Okay.

3:54:35.600 --> 3:54:36.600
 I got you.

3:54:36.600 --> 3:54:38.120
 So because, but not in a mad way.

3:54:38.120 --> 3:54:39.120
 Okay.

3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:47.120
 So computation potentially is not conserved, which is a fascinating idea.

3:54:47.120 --> 3:54:50.920
 Intelligence is not conserved.

3:54:50.920 --> 3:54:54.640
 Intelligence is not conserved.

3:54:54.640 --> 3:55:01.200
 I suppose that's deeply connected to time being fundamental.

3:55:01.200 --> 3:55:06.560
 The natural consequence of that is if time is fundamental and the universe is inflating

3:55:06.560 --> 3:55:12.200
 in time, if you like, then there are one or two conservation laws that we need to have

3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:14.360
 a look at.

3:55:14.360 --> 3:55:17.800
 And I wonder if that means the total energy of the universe is actually increasing over

3:55:17.800 --> 3:55:25.800
 time, and this may be completely ludicrous, but we do have all this dark energy that we

3:55:25.800 --> 3:55:29.560
 have some anomalies, let's say, dark matter and dark energy.

3:55:29.560 --> 3:55:35.880
 If we don't add them in, galaxies, so dark matter, I think doesn't hold, you need to

3:55:35.880 --> 3:55:39.000
 hold the galaxies together and there's some other observational issues.

3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:42.280
 Could dark energy just be time?

3:55:42.280 --> 3:55:50.200
 Also figuring out what dark energy is might give us some deep clues about this.

3:55:50.200 --> 3:55:53.240
 Not just time, but the consequences of time.

3:55:53.240 --> 3:55:57.320
 So it could be that, I mean, I'm not saying there's perpetual motions allowed in this

3:55:57.320 --> 3:56:03.400
 free lunch, but I'm saying if the universe is intrinsically asymmetric, and it appears

3:56:03.400 --> 3:56:11.280
 to be, and it's generating novelty, and it appears to, couldn't that just be a mechanistically

3:56:11.280 --> 3:56:13.680
 how reality works?

3:56:13.680 --> 3:56:20.800
 And therefore, I don't really like this idea that the, so I want to live in a deterministic

3:56:20.800 --> 3:56:28.720
 universe that is undetermined, right, the only way I can do that is if time is fundamental.

3:56:28.720 --> 3:56:32.000
 Because otherwise, it's all the rest of us just, it's just sleight of hand, because

3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:37.360
 the physicists will say, yes, everything's deterministic, Newton is Newtonian mechanics

3:56:37.360 --> 3:56:42.560
 is deterministic, quantum mechanics is deterministic, let's take the ever ready in view.

3:56:42.560 --> 3:56:46.600
 And then basically we can just draw out this massive universe branching, but it closes

3:56:46.600 --> 3:56:48.120
 again and we get it all back.

3:56:48.120 --> 3:56:52.040
 And don't worry, you're feeling a free will is effective.

3:56:52.040 --> 3:56:55.640
 But what the physicists are actually saying is the entire future is mapped out.

3:56:55.640 --> 3:57:00.520
 And that is clearly problematical.

3:57:00.520 --> 3:57:07.640
 And clearly, because that's not so clear, it's just problematic.

3:57:07.640 --> 3:57:12.920
 Well, yeah, yeah, so it's, because that maybe is just the way it is, it's problematic to

3:57:12.920 --> 3:57:15.000
 you, a creature along the timeline.

3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:18.600
 I want to reduce the number of beliefs I need to understand the universe.

3:57:18.600 --> 3:57:24.360
 So if time is fundamental, I don't need to have magic order at the beginning, and I don't

3:57:24.360 --> 3:57:25.720
 need a second law.

3:57:25.720 --> 3:57:28.920
 But you do need the magical belief that time is fundamental.

3:57:28.920 --> 3:57:34.120
 I need the, I need the observation that I'm seeing to be just the cow it is all the way

3:57:34.120 --> 3:57:35.120
 down.

3:57:35.120 --> 3:57:40.880
 But the earth also looks flat, if you, if you agree with your observation.

3:57:40.880 --> 3:57:43.400
 So we can't necessarily trust our observation.

3:57:43.400 --> 3:57:47.040
 I know the earth isn't flat because I can send a satellite into space like a fly.

3:57:47.040 --> 3:57:50.600
 No, but now you see, now you're using the tools, the science and the technology.

3:57:50.600 --> 3:57:55.080
 But I'm using, but I'm saying I'm going to do experiments that start to show.

3:57:55.080 --> 3:57:57.480
 I mean, I, I think that it's worth.

3:57:57.480 --> 3:58:03.280
 So if you can't, so if I cannot do an experiment or a thought experiment that it will test

3:58:03.280 --> 3:58:07.840
 this assumption, then the assumption is without merit really in the end.

3:58:07.840 --> 3:58:09.840
 You know, that's, it's fine.

3:58:09.840 --> 3:58:15.920
 So that's a beautiful idea you hold yourself to that's, that's a, that's given that you

3:58:15.920 --> 3:58:18.840
 think deeply in a philosophical way.

3:58:18.840 --> 3:58:23.320
 You think about some of these really important issues and you have theoretical frameworks

3:58:23.320 --> 3:58:30.840
 like assembly theory, it's really nice that you're always grounded with experiment.

3:58:30.840 --> 3:58:33.440
 That's, that's so refreshing.

3:58:33.440 --> 3:58:35.480
 That's so beautifully refreshing.

3:58:35.480 --> 3:58:42.360
 Now that we're holding you to the grounded in experiment to the harsh truth of reality.

3:58:42.360 --> 3:58:45.480
 Let me ask the big, the big ridiculous question.

3:58:45.480 --> 3:58:47.560
 What is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:58:47.560 --> 3:58:49.120
 What's the meaning of life?

3:58:49.120 --> 3:58:52.280
 Why this time is fundamental.

3:58:52.280 --> 3:58:59.640
 It's marching forward and along this long timeline come along a bunch of descendants

3:58:59.640 --> 3:59:07.640
 of apes that have come up with cellular automata and computers and now computers.

3:59:07.640 --> 3:59:09.760
 Why?

3:59:09.760 --> 3:59:11.840
 I have so many different answers to this question.

3:59:11.840 --> 3:59:16.520
 It depends on, on what day I would say that given the way of the conversation we had today,

3:59:16.520 --> 3:59:19.880
 I'd say the meaning, well, we make our own meaning.

3:59:19.880 --> 3:59:21.040
 I think that's fine.

3:59:21.040 --> 3:59:27.160
 But I think the universe wants to explore every possible configuration that this allows

3:59:27.160 --> 3:59:28.720
 us to explore.

3:59:28.720 --> 3:59:33.160
 And this goes back to the kind of question that you're asking about, Yasha and the existence

3:59:33.160 --> 3:59:35.280
 and non existence of things, right?

3:59:35.280 --> 3:59:40.360
 So if the universe is a Turing machine that's churning through a load of states and you

3:59:40.360 --> 3:59:45.360
 think about combinatorial theory before assembly theory, so everything is possible.

3:59:45.360 --> 3:59:51.200
 What Yasha and I were saying is, well, not everything is possible, we don't see the combinatorial

3:59:51.200 --> 3:59:52.200
 explosion.

3:59:52.200 --> 3:59:54.000
 We see something else.

3:59:54.000 --> 3:59:57.800
 And what we see is evidence of memory.

3:59:57.800 --> 4:00:02.960
 So there's, there clearly seems to be some interference between the combinatorial explosion

4:00:02.960 --> 4:00:06.200
 of things and what the universe allows.

4:00:06.200 --> 4:00:10.720
 And it's like this kind of constructive, destructive interference.

4:00:10.720 --> 4:00:18.480
 So maybe the universe is not just about it is assembling objects in space and time.

4:00:18.480 --> 4:00:23.880
 And those objects are able to search more space and time and the universe is just infinitely

4:00:23.880 --> 4:00:24.880
 creative.

4:00:24.880 --> 4:00:29.400
 And I guess I'm searching for why the universe is infinitely creative is infinitely creative.

4:00:29.400 --> 4:00:34.920
 And maybe the meaning is just simply to make as many objects create as many things as possible.

4:00:34.920 --> 4:00:39.080
 And I see a future of the universe that doesn't result in the heat there for the universe.

4:00:39.080 --> 4:00:44.840
 This is going to extract every ounce of creativity it can out of it because that's what we see

4:00:44.840 --> 4:00:45.840
 on Earth, right?

4:00:45.840 --> 4:00:51.880
 And if you think that almost like intelligence is not conserved that maybe creativity isn't

4:00:51.880 --> 4:00:52.880
 either.

4:00:52.880 --> 4:00:57.160
 Maybe like it's an infinite well.

4:00:57.160 --> 4:01:00.560
 So like creativity is ultimately tied to novelty.

4:01:00.560 --> 4:01:06.640
 You're coming up with cool new configurations of things and maybe I just can continue indefinitely.

4:01:06.640 --> 4:01:13.760
 And this human species that was created along the way is probably just one method like that's

4:01:13.760 --> 4:01:19.720
 able to ask the universe about itself is just one way to explore creativity.

4:01:19.720 --> 4:01:22.800
 Maybe there's other meta levels on top of that.

4:01:22.800 --> 4:01:27.880
 Like obviously as a collective intelligence will create organisms, maybe there'll be organisms

4:01:27.880 --> 4:01:37.520
 that ask themselves questions about themselves in a deeper, bigger picture way that we humans

4:01:37.520 --> 4:01:38.520
 do.

4:01:38.520 --> 4:01:42.760
 First to ask questions about the humans and then construct some kind of hybrid systems

4:01:42.760 --> 4:01:45.360
 that ask themselves about the collective aspect.

4:01:45.360 --> 4:01:49.160
 Just like some weird stacking that we can't even imagine yet.

4:01:49.160 --> 4:01:52.880
 And that stacking, I mean, I've discussed this stacking a lot with Sarah Walker who's

4:01:52.880 --> 4:01:57.760
 a professor of physics and astrobiology at ASU.

4:01:57.760 --> 4:02:03.240
 And we argue about how creative the universe is going to be and is it just deterministic

4:02:03.240 --> 4:02:09.240
 at all that because I think she's more of a free will thinker and I'm of a less free

4:02:09.240 --> 4:02:10.240
 will thinker.

4:02:10.240 --> 4:02:14.780
 But I think we're beginning to converge and understanding that because there's simply

4:02:14.780 --> 4:02:19.360
 a missing understanding right now that we don't understand how the universe, we don't

4:02:19.360 --> 4:02:23.560
 know what rules the universe has to allow the universe to contemplate itself.

4:02:23.560 --> 4:02:28.400
 So asking the meaning of it before we even know what those rules are is premature.

4:02:28.400 --> 4:02:32.200
 But my guess is that it's not meaningless and it isn't just about that.

4:02:32.200 --> 4:02:34.120
 And there are three levels of meanings.

4:02:34.120 --> 4:02:35.960
 Obviously the universe wants us to do stuff.

4:02:35.960 --> 4:02:36.960
 We're interacting with each other.

4:02:36.960 --> 4:02:41.320
 So we create meaning in our own society and our own interactions with humanity.

4:02:41.320 --> 4:02:44.600
 But I do think there is something else going on.

4:02:44.600 --> 4:02:50.160
 But because reality is so weird, we're just scratching at that.

4:02:50.160 --> 4:02:53.080
 And I think that we have to make the experiments better.

4:02:53.080 --> 4:02:59.280
 And we have to perhaps join across not just for the computation lists and what I tried

4:02:59.280 --> 4:03:01.280
 to do with Yasha is meet him halfway.

4:03:01.280 --> 4:03:03.320
 So what happens if I become a computation list?

4:03:03.320 --> 4:03:04.320
 What do I gain?

4:03:04.320 --> 4:03:08.280
 A lot, it turns out, because I can make Turing machines in the universe.

4:03:08.280 --> 4:03:12.160
 Because on the one hand, I'm making computers which are state machines inspired by Turing.

4:03:12.160 --> 4:03:14.680
 On the other hand, I'm saying they can't exist.

4:03:14.680 --> 4:03:17.000
 Well clearly, I can't have my cake and eat it.

4:03:17.000 --> 4:03:19.080
 So there's something weird going on there.

4:03:19.080 --> 4:03:23.120
 So then did the universe have to make a continuous to discrete transition or is the universe

4:03:23.120 --> 4:03:24.120
 just discrete?

4:03:24.120 --> 4:03:25.120
 It's probably just discrete.

4:03:25.120 --> 4:03:31.120
 So if it's just discrete, then there are, I will then give Yasha his Turing like property

4:03:31.120 --> 4:03:32.120
 in the universe.

4:03:32.120 --> 4:03:35.480
 But maybe there's something else below it, which is the constructor that constructs the

4:03:35.480 --> 4:03:36.480
 Turing machine.

4:03:36.480 --> 4:03:43.560
 That then constructs, it's a bit like you generate a computing system that then is able

4:03:43.560 --> 4:03:48.680
 to build an abstraction that then recognizes it can make a generalizable abstraction because

4:03:48.680 --> 4:03:55.280
 human beings with mathematics have been able to go on and build physical computers, if

4:03:55.280 --> 4:03:57.160
 that makes any sense.

4:03:57.160 --> 4:03:58.080
 And I think that's the meaning.

4:03:58.080 --> 4:04:04.880
 I think that's, as far as we can, the meaning will be further elucidated with further experiments.

4:04:04.880 --> 4:04:13.480
 Well, you mentioned Sarah, I think you and Sarah Walker are just these fascinating human

4:04:13.480 --> 4:04:14.480
 beings.

4:04:14.480 --> 4:04:20.200
 I'm really fortunate to have the opportunity to be in your presence to study your work,

4:04:20.200 --> 4:04:22.200
 to follow along with your work.

4:04:22.200 --> 4:04:23.840
 I'm a big fan.

4:04:23.840 --> 4:04:29.640
 Like I told you offline, I hope we get a chance to talk again with perhaps just the two of

4:04:29.640 --> 4:04:35.280
 us, but also with Sarah, that's a fascinating dynamic for people who haven't heard.

4:04:35.280 --> 4:04:39.840
 I suppose on Clubhouse is where I heard you guys talk, but you have an incredible dynamic

4:04:39.840 --> 4:04:43.280
 and I also can't wait to hear you and Yosha talk.

4:04:43.280 --> 4:04:51.680
 So I think if there's some point in this predetermined or yet to be determined future

4:04:51.680 --> 4:04:57.840
 where the three of us, you and Sarah or the four of us with Yosha could meet and talk

4:04:57.840 --> 4:05:03.600
 would be a beautiful future and I look forward to most futures, but I look forward to that

4:05:03.600 --> 4:05:04.600
 one in particular.

4:05:04.600 --> 4:05:08.480
 Lee, thank you so much for spending your valuable time with me today.

4:05:08.480 --> 4:05:10.840
 Thanks Lex, it's been a pleasure.

4:05:10.840 --> 4:05:13.640
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lee Cronin.

 And now let me leave you with some words from the mad scientist Rick Sanchez of Rick and

4:05:22.880 --> 4:05:32.880
 Morty fame, to live is to risk it all, otherwise you're just an inner chunk of randomly assembled

4:05:32.880 --> 4:05:39.200
 molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.

4:05:39.200 --> 4:05:55.280
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
