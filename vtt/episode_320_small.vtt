00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
 The lesson I would want everyone to take from the story of the First World War

00:07.360 --> 00:18.160
 is that human life is not cheap, that all of the warring powers thought that just by throwing

00:19.200 --> 00:25.840
 more men and more material at the front, they would solve their political problems with military

00:25.840 --> 00:33.520
 force. And at the end of the day, in 1918, one side did win that, but it didn't actually solve

00:33.520 --> 00:38.080
 any of those political problems. You said that World War I gave birth to the surveillance state in

00:38.080 --> 00:46.000
 the U.S. Can you explain? The following is a conversation with Christopher Cappuzola,

00:46.000 --> 00:52.960
 a historian at MIT specializing in the history of politics and war, in modern American history,

00:52.960 --> 00:57.840
 especially about the role of World War I in defining the trajectory of the United States

00:57.840 --> 01:04.640
 and our human civilization in the 20th and 21st centuries. This is the Lux Friedman podcast

01:04.640 --> 01:09.280
 to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

01:09.280 --> 01:15.520
 here's Christopher Cappuzola. Let's start with a big and difficult question. How did World War I

01:15.520 --> 01:22.720
 start? On the one hand, World War I started because of a series of events in the summer of 1914,

01:22.720 --> 01:28.720
 that brought the major powers of Europe into conflict with one another. But I actually think

01:28.720 --> 01:37.200
 it's more useful to say that World War I started at least a generation earlier when rising powers,

01:37.200 --> 01:42.720
 particularly Germany, started devoting more and more of their resources toward military

01:42.720 --> 01:48.320
 affairs and naval affairs. This sets off an arms race in Europe. It sets off a rivalry

01:48.320 --> 01:55.360
 over the colonial world and who will control the resources in Africa and Asia. And so by the time

01:55.360 --> 02:01.200
 you get to the summer of 1914, in a lot of ways, I say the war has already begun. And this is just

02:01.200 --> 02:08.080
 the match that lights the flame. So the capacity for war was brewing within the leaders and within

02:08.080 --> 02:15.920
 the populace. They started accepting slowly through the culture propagated this idea that

02:15.920 --> 02:23.840
 we can go to war. It's a good idea to go to war. It's a good idea to expand and dominate others,

02:23.840 --> 02:29.280
 that kind of thing. Maybe not put in those clear terms, but just the sense that military action

02:29.280 --> 02:37.200
 is the way that nations operate at the global scale. Yes, yes and. So yes, there's a sense that

02:37.200 --> 02:43.920
 the military can be the solution to political conflict in Europe itself. And the and is that war

02:43.920 --> 02:50.640
 and military conflict are already happening, right? That there's war, particularly in Africa,

02:50.640 --> 02:57.920
 in North Africa, in the Middle East, Balkans. Conflict is already underway. And the European

02:57.920 --> 03:02.640
 powers haven't faced off against each other. They've usually faced off against, in asymmetrical

03:02.640 --> 03:08.800
 conflict, against much less powerful states. But in some ways, that war is already underway.

03:08.800 --> 03:16.080
 Right. So do you think it was inevitable? Because World War One is brought up as a case study where

03:16.080 --> 03:24.320
 it seems like a few accidental leaders and a few accidental events or one accidental event led

03:24.320 --> 03:29.200
 to the war. And if you change that one little thing, it could have avoided the war. Your sense is

03:30.240 --> 03:35.120
 the the the drums of war have been beating for quite a while and it would have happened

03:35.120 --> 03:40.160
 almost no matter what or very likely to have happened. Yes, historians never like to say

03:40.160 --> 03:44.880
 things are inevitable. And certainly, you know, there were people who could have chosen a different

03:44.880 --> 03:51.920
 path, both in the short term and the long term. But fundamentally, there were irreconcilable

03:51.920 --> 03:59.360
 conflicts in the system of empires in the world in 1914. I can't see, you know, it didn't have to

03:59.360 --> 04:04.080
 be this war, but it had it probably had to be a war. So there was the German Empire,

04:04.080 --> 04:12.240
 the Austro Hungarian Empire, there's France and Great Britain, US, the USP called that empire at

04:12.240 --> 04:20.080
 that moment yet. When do you graduate to empire status? Well, certainly after after 1898, with

04:20.080 --> 04:24.080
 the acquisition of the former territories of the Spanish Empire, you know, the United States has

04:24.080 --> 04:31.040
 formal colonial possessions. And it has sort of mindsets of rule and military acquisition that

04:31.040 --> 04:36.720
 would define empire in a kind of more informal sense. So you would say you would put the blame

04:38.320 --> 04:43.680
 or the responsibility of starting World War One into the hands of the German Empire

04:43.680 --> 04:51.360
 and Kaiser Wilhelm II? You know, that's a really tough call to make. And, you know,

04:51.360 --> 04:57.280
 that deciding that is going to keep historians in business for the next 200 years. I think

04:57.280 --> 05:04.320
 there are people who would lay all of the blame on the Germans, right? And, you know,

05:04.320 --> 05:10.560
 who would point toward a generation of arms buildup, you know, alliances that Germany made

05:10.560 --> 05:18.160
 and promises that they made to their allies in the Balkans to the Austro Hungarians. And so,

05:18.160 --> 05:23.840
 yes, there's an awful lot of responsibility there. There has been a trend lately to say,

05:23.840 --> 05:30.400
 no, it's no one's fault, right? That, you know, that all of the various powers literally were

05:30.400 --> 05:36.640
 sleepwalking into the war, right? They backed into it inadvertently. I think that lets everyone a

05:36.640 --> 05:42.720
 little too much off the hook, right? And so I think in between is, you know, I would put the blame

05:42.720 --> 05:49.200
 on the system of empires itself, on the system. But in that system, the actor that sort of carries

05:49.200 --> 05:56.400
 the most responsibility is definitely Imperial Germany. So the leader of Austro Hungarian

05:56.400 --> 06:06.640
 Empire, Franz Jose I, his nephew is Archduke Franz Ferdinand. He was assassinated. And so that

06:07.200 --> 06:15.520
 didn't have to lead to a war. And then the leader of the German Empire, Kaiser Wilhelm II,

06:15.520 --> 06:27.520
 and pressured sort of started talking trash and boiling the water that ultimately resulted in

06:27.520 --> 06:33.280
 the explosion, plus all the other players. So what can you describe the dynamics of how that

06:33.280 --> 06:38.080
 unrolled? Well, US, what's the role of US? What's the role of France? What's the role of Great

06:38.080 --> 06:45.040
 Britain, Germany and Austro Hungarian Empire? Yeah, over the course of about four weeks, right?

06:45.040 --> 06:52.320
 Following the assassination of the Archduke in Sarajevo, it sort of triggers a series of

06:53.120 --> 07:00.160
 political conflicts and ultimately ultimatums, sort of demanding sort of that one or other

07:00.160 --> 07:06.880
 power sort of stand down in response to the demands of either, you know, Britain, France, or in

07:06.880 --> 07:14.160
 turn, Germany or Russia, at the same time that those alliances kind of trigger automatic responses

07:14.160 --> 07:20.560
 from the other side. And so it escalates. And once that escalation is combined with the call up of

07:20.560 --> 07:27.360
 military troops, then none of those powers wants to be sort of the last one to kind of get ready

07:27.360 --> 07:33.680
 for conflict. So even throughout it, they think they are getting ready in a defensive maneuver.

07:34.640 --> 07:40.400
 And if they think if there is conflict, well, it might be a skirmish, it might be, you know,

07:40.400 --> 07:47.040
 sort of a standoff. It could be solved with diplomacy later, because diplomacy is failing now.

07:47.840 --> 07:53.920
 That turns out not to be the case. Diplomacy fails. It's not a skirmish. It becomes a massive war.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.760
 And the Americans are watching all of this from the sidelines. They have very little

07:57.760 --> 08:03.440
 influence over what happens that summer. How does it go from a skirmish between a few nations

08:04.080 --> 08:08.320
 to a global war? Is there a place where there's a phase transition?

08:08.320 --> 08:13.440
 Yeah, I think the phase transition is over the course of the fall of 1914,

08:14.320 --> 08:19.760
 when the Germans make an initial sort of bold move into France. In many ways,

08:19.760 --> 08:28.080
 they're fighting the last war, the Franco Prussian War of 1870. And they really do sort of, you know,

08:28.080 --> 08:34.880
 kind of want to have a quick sort of lightning strike in some ways against France to kind of

08:34.880 --> 08:41.440
 bring the war to a speedy conclusion. France turns out to be able to fight back more effectively

08:41.440 --> 08:50.000
 than the Germans expected. And then the battle lines sort of harden. And then behind that,

08:51.600 --> 08:55.840
 the French and the Germans, as well as the British on the side of the French,

08:56.400 --> 09:02.160
 start digging in, literally, right, and digging trenches, trenches that at first are, you know,

09:02.160 --> 09:08.800
 three feet deep to, you know, to avoid shelling from artillery, then become six feet, ten feet

09:08.800 --> 09:14.320
 deep, you know, two miles wide, that include telegraph wires that include whole hospitals

09:14.320 --> 09:20.720
 in the back. And then at that point, you know, the front is locked in place. And the only way

09:20.720 --> 09:27.440
 to break that is sort of basically dialing the war up to 11, right, sort of massive numbers of troops,

09:27.440 --> 09:32.720
 massive efforts, none of which work, right? And so the war is stuck in this. But that's the,

09:33.280 --> 09:35.120
 that's the phase transition right there.

09:36.480 --> 09:42.240
 What were the machines of war in that case? You mentioned trenches. What were the guns used?

09:43.360 --> 09:48.320
 What was the size of guns? What are we talking about? What did Germany start

09:49.120 --> 09:54.480
 accumulating that led up to this war? One of the things that we see immediately

09:54.480 --> 10:03.520
 is the industrial revolution of the previous 30 or 40 years brought to bear on warfare, right?

10:03.520 --> 10:09.760
 And so you see sort of machine guns, you see artillery, you know, these are the kind of the

10:09.760 --> 10:15.920
 key weapons of war on both sides, right? The vast majority of battlefield casualties are from

10:15.920 --> 10:22.160
 artillery shelling from one side to another, not, you know, sort of rifle or even sort of,

10:22.160 --> 10:29.360
 you know, machine gun kind of attacks. In some ways, the weapons of war are human beings, right?

10:29.360 --> 10:35.760
 You know, tens of thousands of them poured over the top in these sort of waves to kind of try to

10:35.760 --> 10:41.600
 break through the enemy lines. And it would work for a little while, you know, but holding the

10:41.600 --> 10:47.600
 territory that had been gained often proved to be even more demanding than gaining it. And so often,

10:47.600 --> 10:52.480
 you know, each side would retreat back into the trenches and wait for another day.

10:52.480 --> 11:01.840
 And how did Russia, how did Britain, how did France get pulled into the war? I suppose the

11:01.840 --> 11:08.480
 France one is the easy one. But what is the order of events here? How it becomes a global war?

11:08.480 --> 11:17.120
 Yeah. So Britain, France and Russia are at this time, and they're an alliance. And so the conflicts,

11:17.120 --> 11:22.800
 you know, in the summer of 1914 that lead sort of to the declarations of war happened sort of one

11:22.800 --> 11:29.760
 after another, right, in August, in late August of 1914. And all three powers essentially come in at

11:29.760 --> 11:37.360
 the same time, because they have promised to do so through a series of alliances conducted secretly

11:37.360 --> 11:43.920
 in the years before 1914 that committed them to defend one another. Germany, Austria, Hungary,

11:43.920 --> 11:49.760
 and the Ottoman Empire have their own sort of set of secret agreements that also commit them

11:49.760 --> 11:55.760
 to defend one another. And what this does is it sort of brings them all into conflict at

11:55.760 --> 12:01.360
 the exact same moment. They're also, for many of these countries, bringing not just their national

12:01.360 --> 12:07.200
 armies, but also their empires into the conflict, right? So Britain and France, of course, have,

12:07.200 --> 12:12.800
 you know, enormous sort of global empires that begin mobilizing soldiers as well as raw materials.

12:12.800 --> 12:18.480
 Germany has, you know, less of an overseas empire. Russia and the Ottoman Empire, of course, have

12:18.480 --> 12:23.360
 their own sort of hinterland, you know, within the empire. And very soon, you know, sort of all

12:23.360 --> 12:28.400
 of the warring powers are bringing the entire world into the conflict.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.320
 Did they have a sense of how deadly the war is? I mean, this is another

12:33.440 --> 12:35.920
 scale of death and destruction.

12:35.920 --> 12:42.800
 At the beginning, no, but very quickly. The scale of the devastation of these sort of massive,

12:42.800 --> 12:49.600
 over the top attacks on trenches is apparent to the military officers, and it very quickly becomes

12:49.600 --> 12:54.560
 apparent even at home. You know, there is, of course, censorship of the battlefields and,

12:54.560 --> 13:00.240
 you know, specific details don't reach people. But, you know, for civilians and in any of the

13:00.240 --> 13:07.360
 warring powers, they know fairly soon how destructive the war is. And to me, that's always been a real

13:07.360 --> 13:13.680
 sort of puzzle, right? So that by the time the United States comes to decide whether to join

13:13.680 --> 13:19.280
 the war in 1917, they know exactly what they're getting into, right? They're not backing into

13:19.280 --> 13:24.800
 the war in the ways that the European powers did. You know, they've seen the devastation,

13:24.800 --> 13:30.640
 they've seen photographs, they've seen injured soldiers, and they make that choice anyway.

13:30.640 --> 13:39.680
 When you say they, do you mean the leaders or the people? Did the death and destruction reach

13:39.680 --> 13:45.520
 the minds of the American people by that time? Yes, absolutely. You know, we don't,

13:45.520 --> 13:52.160
 in 1917, have the mass media that we have now, but there are images in newspapers,

13:52.160 --> 13:58.080
 there are newsreels that play at the movie theaters. And of course, some of it is sanitized,

13:58.080 --> 14:04.960
 but that combined with press accounts, often really quite descriptive press accounts,

14:04.960 --> 14:10.400
 gory accounts, reached, you know, anyone who cared to read them, you know, certainly plenty

14:10.400 --> 14:15.520
 of people didn't follow the news, felt it was far away. But most Americans who cared about the news

14:15.520 --> 14:19.680
 knew how devastating this war was. Yeah, there's something that happens

14:19.680 --> 14:25.760
 that I recently visited Ukraine for a few weeks. There's something that happens

14:26.880 --> 14:33.200
 with the human mind as you get away from the actual front where the bullets are flying,

14:33.840 --> 14:40.720
 like literally one kilometer away, you start to not feel the war. You'll hear an explosion,

14:40.720 --> 14:45.920
 you'll see an explosion, you start to like get it assimilated to it, or you start to get used to it.

14:45.920 --> 14:51.840
 And then when you get as far away from like currently what is Kiev, you start to, you know,

14:51.840 --> 14:57.520
 the war is going on, everybody around you is fighting in that war, but it's still somehow

14:57.520 --> 15:04.240
 distant. And I think with the United States, with the ocean between, even if you have the stories

15:04.240 --> 15:12.080
 everywhere, it still is somehow distant, like the way a movie is, maybe, yeah, like a movie or a video

15:12.080 --> 15:17.680
 game, it's somewhere else, even if your loved ones are going or you are going to fight.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.880
 Yeah, that is absolutely the case. And in some ways, that's true even for the home fronts in

15:22.880 --> 15:29.280
 Europe, except for the areas where in Belgium and France where the war is right there in your

15:29.280 --> 15:35.440
 backyard. For other people, yeah, there's a distance. And soldiers, of course, feel this very

15:35.440 --> 15:42.160
 strongly when they, European soldiers, when they're able to go home on leave, often, you know, deeply

15:42.160 --> 15:48.400
 present what they see as the luxury that civilians are living in during the war.

15:49.360 --> 15:55.120
 So how did US enter the war? Who was the president? What was the dynamics involved?

15:55.760 --> 15:59.120
 And could it have stayed out?

15:59.120 --> 16:06.000
 To answer your last question first, yes, that the United States could have stayed out of the

16:06.000 --> 16:14.560
 First World War as a military power. The United States could not have ignored the war completely.

16:14.560 --> 16:22.800
 It shaped everything. It shaped trade. It shaped goods and services, agriculture, whether there

16:22.800 --> 16:27.680
 was a crop coming, whether there were immigrants coming across the Atlantic to work in American

16:27.680 --> 16:34.720
 factories. So the US can't ignore the war. But the US makes a choice in 1917 to enter the war

16:35.360 --> 16:44.000
 by declaring war on Germany and Austria. And in that sense, this is a war of choice,

16:44.000 --> 16:50.880
 but it's kicked off by a series of events. So President Woodrow Wilson has been president

16:50.880 --> 16:57.440
 through this entire period of time. He has just run in the 1916 presidential election

16:57.440 --> 17:04.800
 on a campaign to keep the United States out of war. But then in early 1917, the Germans,

17:04.800 --> 17:11.840
 in some ways, sort of twist the Americans arms. The Germans sort of high command comes to understand

17:11.840 --> 17:19.360
 that they're stuck. They're stuck in this trench warfare. They need a big breakthrough.

17:19.360 --> 17:26.400
 Their one big chance is to sort of break the blockade, to push through that the British

17:26.400 --> 17:33.680
 have imposed on them, to break the breakthrough against France. And so they do. And along with

17:33.680 --> 17:39.520
 this, they start sinking ships on the Atlantic, including American ships. The Germans know full

17:39.520 --> 17:45.200
 well this will draw the United States into war. But the Germans look at the United States at this

17:45.200 --> 17:51.760
 moment, a relatively small army, a relatively small navy, a country that, at least on paper,

17:51.760 --> 17:58.720
 is deeply divided about whether to join the war. And so they say, let's do it. They're not going

17:58.720 --> 18:06.400
 to get any American soldiers there in time. It was a gamble, but I think probably that

18:06.400 --> 18:12.960
 their best chance, they took that gamble, they lost. In part because French resistance was strong,

18:13.520 --> 18:18.080
 in part because Americans mobilized much faster and in much greater numbers than the

18:18.080 --> 18:22.160
 Germans thought they would. So the American people were divided. The American people were

18:22.160 --> 18:28.800
 absolutely divided about whether to enter this war. From 1914 to 1917, there is a searing debate

18:29.760 --> 18:35.040
 across the political spectrum. It doesn't break down easily on party lines about whether it was in

18:35.040 --> 18:42.320
 the US interest to do this, whether American troops should be sent abroad, whether Americans

18:42.320 --> 18:50.240
 would end up just being cannon fodder for the European empires. Eventually, as American ships

18:50.240 --> 18:56.160
 are sunk, first in the Lusitania in 1915, then in much greater numbers in 1917,

18:57.280 --> 19:02.720
 the tide starts to turn and Americans feel that our response is necessary. And the actual

19:02.720 --> 19:07.920
 declaration of war in Congress is pretty lopsided, but it's not unanimous by any means.

19:07.920 --> 19:14.480
 Lopsided towards entering the war. Yeah. Well, that's really interesting

19:15.840 --> 19:23.840
 because there's echoes of that in later wars where Congress seems to, nobody wants to be

19:23.840 --> 19:31.280
 the guy that says no to war for some reason. Once you sense that in terms of sorry, in terms of

19:31.280 --> 19:36.720
 politicians, because then you appear weak, but I wonder if that was always the case.

19:36.720 --> 19:44.880
 So, you make the case that World War I is largely responsible for defining what it means to be an

19:44.880 --> 19:50.800
 American citizen. So, in which way does it define the American citizen?

19:51.680 --> 19:56.880
 When you think about citizenship, what it means is two things. First of all, what are your rights

19:56.880 --> 20:03.040
 and obligations? What is the legal citizenship that you have as a citizen of the United States

20:03.040 --> 20:08.800
 or any other state? And the second is a more amorphous definition of what does it mean to

20:08.800 --> 20:16.480
 belong, to be part of America, to feel American, to love it or hate it or be willing to die for it.

20:17.600 --> 20:23.360
 And both of those things really are crystal clear in terms of their importance during the war.

20:24.240 --> 20:31.600
 So, both of those things are on the table, being a citizen who is a citizen who isn't matters.

20:31.600 --> 20:36.720
 So, people who had never carried passports or anything before suddenly have to,

20:37.680 --> 20:42.880
 but also what it means to be an American, to feel like it, to be part of this project,

20:42.880 --> 20:46.720
 is also kind of being defined and enforced during World War I.

20:46.720 --> 20:54.800
 So, project is a funny way to put a global war. So, can you tell the story? Perhaps that's a good

20:54.800 --> 21:03.280
 example of it, of the James Montgomery Flags 1916 poster that reads, I want you.

21:03.280 --> 21:08.480
 Right. A lot of people know this poster, I think, and it's original form or it's

21:08.480 --> 21:13.120
 memeified form, I don't know, but we know this poster and we don't know where it came from,

21:13.120 --> 21:18.960
 or most Americans, I think, me included, didn't know where it came from and it actually comes from

21:18.960 --> 21:27.200
 1916. Does this poster represent the birth of something new in America, which is a

21:29.520 --> 21:36.400
 commodification or, I don't know, that propaganda machine that says what it means to be an American

21:37.280 --> 21:43.760
 is somebody that fights for their country? Yeah. So, the image, it's, in fact, I think one of the

21:43.760 --> 21:49.760
 most recognizable images, not only in the United States, but in the entire world, and you can

21:49.760 --> 21:56.320
 bring it almost anywhere on earth in 2022 and people will know what it refers to. And so,

21:56.320 --> 22:02.560
 this is an image that circulated first as a magazine cover, later as a recruitment poster,

22:03.440 --> 22:08.400
 where the figure is Uncle Sam, sort of pointing at the viewer with his finger, sort of pointing

22:08.400 --> 22:15.360
 and saying, I want you. And the I Want You is a recruitment tool to join the U.S. Army.

22:16.080 --> 22:22.960
 And this image really kind of starts as a kind of, like I said, a magazine cover in 1916

22:22.960 --> 22:28.480
 by the artist James Montgomery Flag. It initially appears under the heading, what are you doing

22:28.480 --> 22:35.360
 for preparedness, meaning to prepare in case war comes to the United States. At that point in 1916,

22:35.360 --> 22:45.040
 we're still neutron. In 1917, it's turned into a U.S. Army recruiting poster. And then it reappears

22:45.040 --> 22:51.520
 in World War II, reappears generations after, like you said, it's now gets remixed, memified.

22:51.520 --> 22:59.520
 It's all over the place. I think, for me, it's a turning point. It's a sort of window into American

22:59.520 --> 23:06.160
 culture at a crucial moment in our history, where the federal government is now embarking on a war

23:06.160 --> 23:13.280
 overseas that's going to make enormous demands on its citizens. And at the same time, where sort of

23:13.280 --> 23:19.200
 technologies of mass production and mass media, and what we would probably call propaganda,

23:20.000 --> 23:24.480
 are being sort of mobilized for the first time in this new kind of way.

23:24.480 --> 23:29.440
 Right. Well, in some sense, it's a fair to say that the empire is born.

23:31.040 --> 23:36.160
 The expanding empire is born from the Noam Chomsky perspective kind of empire

23:37.040 --> 23:41.120
 that seeks to have military influence elsewhere in the world.

23:42.800 --> 23:47.760
 Yes. But I think as historians, we need to be at least as interested in what happens to the people

23:47.760 --> 23:53.360
 who are getting pointed to by Uncle Sam, right, rather than just the one, you know, whether he's

23:53.360 --> 23:59.040
 pointing at us. So yes, he's asking us to do that, but how do we respond?

23:59.760 --> 24:06.080
 And the people responded. So the people are ultimately the machines of history,

24:06.720 --> 24:11.920
 the mechanisms of history. It's not that Uncle Sam can only do so much if the people aren't

24:11.920 --> 24:17.040
 willing to step up. Absolutely. And the American people responded for sure, but they didn't build

24:17.040 --> 24:24.160
 what Uncle Sam asked them to do in that poster. And I think that's kind of a crucial aspect that

24:25.600 --> 24:31.200
 there never would have been sort of global US power without the response that begins in World War

24:31.200 --> 24:37.120
 I. What was the Selective Service Act of 1917? So one of the very first things that Uncle Sam

24:37.120 --> 24:44.080
 wants you to do is to register for selective service for the draft. And the laws passed very

24:44.080 --> 24:51.840
 soon after the US enters the war. It's sort of demanding that all men, first between 21 and 30,

24:51.840 --> 24:59.040
 then between 18 and 45, register for the draft. And they'll be selected by a government agency,

24:59.040 --> 25:02.080
 by a volunteer organization. So it's a requirement to sign up.

25:02.080 --> 25:06.880
 It is a legal requirement to register. Of course, not everyone who registers is selected.

25:06.880 --> 25:13.600
 But over the course of the war, 24 million men register, almost four million serve in some

25:13.600 --> 25:18.320
 fashion. What was the response? What was the feeling amongst the American people to have

25:18.320 --> 25:26.240
 to sign up to the Selective Service Act? Well, have to register. This is a bigger turning point

25:26.240 --> 25:31.840
 than we might think. In some ways, this is a tougher demand of the American public than

25:31.840 --> 25:36.640
 entering the war. It's one thing to declare war on Germany. It's another thing to go down

25:36.640 --> 25:43.120
 to your local post office and fill out the forms that allow your own government to send you there

25:43.120 --> 25:47.920
 to fight. And this is especially important at a time when the federal government doesn't

25:48.480 --> 25:54.240
 really have any other way to find you unless you actually go and register yourself.

25:55.280 --> 26:00.160
 And so ordinary people are participating in the building of this war machine,

26:00.160 --> 26:07.440
 but at least a half a million of them don't and simply never fill out the forms, move from one

26:07.440 --> 26:13.440
 town to another. But you said 20 million did? 20 something? Yeah, about 24 million register,

26:13.440 --> 26:16.800
 at least 500,000. Is it surprising to you that that many registered

26:17.840 --> 26:23.920
 since the country was divided? It is. And that's what I tried to dig in to figure out how did you

26:23.920 --> 26:29.600
 get 24 million people to register for the draft? And it's certainly not coming from the top down.

26:30.880 --> 26:37.920
 There may be 100 agents in what's now called the FBI. It's certainly not being enforced

26:37.920 --> 26:42.880
 from Washington. It's being enforced through the eyes of everyday neighbors,

26:43.840 --> 26:48.800
 through community surveillance, all kinds of ways. Oh, so there was like a pressure?

26:48.800 --> 26:55.440
 There's a lot of pressure. Interesting. So there's not a significant like antiwar

26:56.400 --> 27:00.880
 movement as you would see maybe later with Vietnam and things like this?

27:01.600 --> 27:08.560
 There was a significant movement before 1917, but it becomes very hard to keep up an organized

27:08.560 --> 27:12.560
 antiwar movement after that, particularly when the government starts shutting down protests.

27:12.560 --> 27:20.960
 So as the Selective Service Act of 1917 runs up against some of the freedoms,

27:20.960 --> 27:29.040
 some of the rights that are defined in our founding documents, what was that clash like?

27:29.040 --> 27:34.240
 What was sacrificed? What freedoms and rights were sacrificed in this process?

27:35.200 --> 27:41.280
 I mean, I think on some of the fundamental right is liberty, right? That conscription

27:41.280 --> 27:50.000
 sort of demands sacrifice on the behalf of some, notionally, for the protection of all.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.520
 So even if you're against the war, you're forced to fight?

27:53.520 --> 28:00.560
 Yes. And there were small provisions for conscientious objectors, solely those who had

28:00.560 --> 28:07.600
 religious objections to all war, not political objections to this war. And so several thousand

28:07.600 --> 28:13.760
 were able to take those provisions. But even then, they faced social sanction, they faced

28:13.760 --> 28:20.640
 ridicule, some of them faced intimidation. So those liberty interests, both individual freedom,

28:20.640 --> 28:23.360
 religious freedom, those are some of the first things to go.

28:25.280 --> 28:32.480
 So what about freedom of speech? Was the silencing of the press, of the voices,

28:32.480 --> 28:34.160
 of the different people that were object?

28:34.160 --> 28:39.120
 Yes, absolutely. And so very soon after the Selective Service Act is passed,

28:39.120 --> 28:43.840
 then you get the Espionage Act, which of course is back in the news in 2022.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.120
 What's the Espionage Act?

28:45.120 --> 28:49.440
 The Espionage Act is a sort of omnibus bill. It contains about 10 or different provisions,

28:49.440 --> 28:55.920
 very few of which have to do with espionage. But one key provision basically makes it illegal

28:55.920 --> 29:03.040
 to say or do anything that would interfere with military recruitment. And that provision is used

29:03.040 --> 29:09.920
 to shut down radical publications, to shut down German language publications. And this really

29:09.920 --> 29:12.720
 has a chilling impact on speech during the war.

29:14.080 --> 29:20.640
 Could you put into words what it means to be an American citizen that is in part sparked by

29:20.640 --> 29:28.800
 World War I? So what does that mean? Somebody that should be willing to sacrifice

29:28.800 --> 29:38.640
 certain freedoms to fight for their country. Somebody that's willing to fight the spread

29:38.640 --> 29:46.400
 freedom elsewhere in the world, spread the American ideals. Does that begin to tell the story

29:46.400 --> 29:52.720
 what it means to be an American? I think what we see is a change. So citizenship

29:52.720 --> 30:02.720
 during World War I now includes the obligation to defend the country, to serve, and to if asked

30:02.720 --> 30:10.800
 to die for it. And we certainly see that. And I think we see the close linkage of military

30:10.800 --> 30:17.360
 service and US citizenship coming out of this time period. But when you start making lots of

30:17.360 --> 30:23.280
 demands on people to fulfill obligations, in turn, they're going to start demanding rights. And we

30:23.280 --> 30:29.120
 start to see not necessarily during the war, but after more demands for free speech protections,

30:29.120 --> 30:35.440
 more demands for equality, for marginalized groups. And so obligations and rights are

30:35.440 --> 30:41.920
 sort of developing in a dynamic relationship. Oh, it's almost like an overreach of power sparked

30:41.920 --> 30:51.440
 a sense like, oh, crap, we can't trust centralized power to drag us into a war we need to be able to.

30:51.440 --> 30:55.360
 So there's the birth of that tension between the government and the people.

30:56.080 --> 31:01.360
 It's a rebirth of it. Of course, that tension is always there. But in its modern form,

31:01.360 --> 31:06.000
 I think it comes from this point. Reintensification of it. So you said that

31:06.000 --> 31:10.160
 World War I gave birth to the surveillance state in the US. Can you explain?

31:10.160 --> 31:19.040
 Yeah. So the Espionage Act sort of empowers federal organizations to watch other Americans.

31:19.040 --> 31:25.680
 They are particularly interested in anyone who is obstructing the draft, anyone who is trying to

31:25.680 --> 31:32.640
 kind of organize labor or strikes or radical movements, and anyone who might have sympathy

31:32.640 --> 31:38.560
 for Germany, which basically means all German Americans come under surveillance. Initially,

31:38.560 --> 31:46.240
 this is a very small scale. But soon, every government agency gets involved from the Treasury

31:46.240 --> 31:51.440
 Department's Secret Service to the Post Office, which is sort of breeding mail to the Justice

31:51.440 --> 31:58.720
 Department, which mobilizes 200,000 volunteers. It's a really significant enterprise. Much of

31:58.720 --> 32:04.320
 it goes away after the war. But of all the things that go away, this core of the surveillance state

32:04.320 --> 32:13.920
 is the thing that persists most fully. Is this also a place where the size of government starts

32:13.920 --> 32:19.600
 to grow in these different organizations? Or maybe it creates a momentum for growth of government?

32:19.600 --> 32:28.160
 Oh, it's exponential growth. Over the course of the war, by almost any metric you use,

32:28.160 --> 32:32.640
 the size of the federal budget, the number of federal employees, the number of soldiers in

32:32.640 --> 32:37.920
 the standing army, all of those things skyrocket during the war. They go down after the war,

32:37.920 --> 32:44.640
 but they never go down to what they were before. And probably gave a momentum for growth over time.

32:44.640 --> 32:52.880
 Yes, absolutely. Did World War I give birth to the military industrial complex in the United States?

32:52.880 --> 33:02.800
 So war profiteering, expanding of the war machine in order to financially benefit

33:02.800 --> 33:09.040
 a lot of parties involved. So I guess I would maybe break that into two parts.

33:11.600 --> 33:18.400
 On the one hand, yes, there is war profiteering. There are investigations of it

33:18.400 --> 33:25.280
 in the years after the war. There's a widespread concern that the profit motive had played too

33:25.280 --> 33:32.080
 much of a part in the war. And that's definitely the case. But I think when you try to think of this

33:32.080 --> 33:39.520
 term military industrial complex, it's best to think of it as at what point does the one side

33:39.520 --> 33:47.200
 lock in the other, that military choices are shaped by industry objectives and vice versa.

33:47.200 --> 33:53.040
 And I don't think that that was fully locked into place during World War I. I think that's

33:53.040 --> 33:59.840
 really a Cold War phenomenon when the United States is on this intense footing for two generations

33:59.840 --> 34:05.520
 in a row. So industrial is really important there. There is companies. So before then,

34:07.120 --> 34:13.920
 weapons of war were created, were funded directly by the government. Who was manufacturing the

34:13.920 --> 34:20.240
 weapons of war? They were generally manufactured by private industry. There were, of course,

34:21.360 --> 34:26.560
 arsenals, sort of 19th century iterations where the government would produce its own weapons,

34:26.560 --> 34:32.560
 partly to make sure that they got what they wanted. But most of the weapons of war for all

34:32.560 --> 34:37.760
 of the European powers and the United States are produced by private industry. So why do you say

34:37.760 --> 34:43.680
 that in military industrial complex didn't start then? What was the important thing that happened

34:43.680 --> 34:51.760
 in the Cold War? I think one way to think about it is the Cold War is a point at which it switches

34:51.760 --> 34:58.320
 from being a dial to a ratchet. So during World War I, the relationship between the military and

34:58.320 --> 35:07.520
 industry dials up fast and high and stays that way, and it dials back down. Whereas during

35:07.520 --> 35:12.400
 the Cold War, sort of the relationship between the two often looks more like a ratchet. It goes

35:12.400 --> 35:19.120
 up. It comes unstoppable. It goes up again. In the way that you start, I think, the way the

35:19.120 --> 35:27.760
 military industrial complex is often involved, discussed is as a system that is unstoppable.

35:28.960 --> 35:37.920
 Like it expands. It almost, I mean, if you take a very cynical view, it creates war

35:37.920 --> 35:45.840
 so that it can make money. It doesn't just find places where it can help through military conflict.

35:45.840 --> 35:52.800
 It creates tensions that directly or indirectly lead to military conflict that it can then fuel

35:52.800 --> 36:02.000
 and make money from. That is certainly one of the concerns of both people who are critical of the

36:02.000 --> 36:09.120
 First World War and then also of Dwight Eisenhower when he's president and in his farewell address,

36:09.120 --> 36:14.560
 where he introduces the term military industrial complex. Some of it is about the profit motive,

36:14.560 --> 36:21.360
 but some of it is a fear that Eisenhower had that no one had an interest in stopping this,

36:22.160 --> 36:27.920
 and that no one had a voice in stopping it, and that the ordinary American could really do nothing

36:27.920 --> 36:32.480
 to dial things down.

36:32.480 --> 36:39.840
 Is it strange to you that we don't often hear that kind of speech today with Eisenhower

36:39.840 --> 36:45.680
 speaking about the military industrial complex? For example, we'll have people criticizing

36:45.680 --> 36:54.560
 the spending on war efforts, but they're not discussing the machinery of the military

36:54.560 --> 37:02.320
 industrial complex like the basic way that human nature works. They'll get ourselves trapped in

37:02.320 --> 37:09.360
 this thing. They're saying there's better things to spend money on versus describing a very seemingly

37:09.360 --> 37:18.080
 natural process of when you build weapons of war that's going to lead to more war. It pulls you in

37:18.080 --> 37:26.160
 somehow. Yeah, I would say throughout the Cold War and even after the end of it,

37:26.720 --> 37:34.480
 there has not been a sustained conversation in the United States about our defense establishment,

37:35.280 --> 37:45.920
 what we really need, and what serves our interest, and to what extent other things like

37:45.920 --> 37:53.520
 market forces, profit motives, belong in that conversation. What's interesting is that in

37:53.520 --> 37:59.600
 the generation after the First World War, that conversation was on the table through a series

37:59.600 --> 38:05.680
 of investigations in the US, the Nye Committee in Britain, a Royal Commission, journalistic

38:05.680 --> 38:11.920
 exposés. This would have been just talked about constantly in the years between about 1930 and

38:11.920 --> 38:17.760
 1936, as people were starting to worry that storm clouds were gathering in Europe again.

38:19.040 --> 38:27.040
 Yeah, but it almost seems like those folks get pushed to the fringes. You're made an activist

38:28.640 --> 38:37.600
 versus a thinking leader. Those discussions are often marginalized, framed as conspiracy theory,

38:37.600 --> 38:45.920
 et cetera. I think it's important to realize that in the generation after World War I,

38:45.920 --> 38:54.000
 this was a serious civic conversation. It led to investigations of defense finance. It led to

38:54.000 --> 39:00.960
 experiments in Britain and France and public finance of war material. I think those conversations

39:00.960 --> 39:08.880
 need to be reconvened now in the 21st century. Is there any parallels between World War I

39:08.880 --> 39:20.000
 and the war in Ukraine? The reason I bring it up is because you mentioned there was a hunger

39:20.000 --> 39:27.040
 for war, a capacity for war that was already established, and the different parties were

39:27.040 --> 39:35.520
 just boiling the tensions. There's a case made that America had a role to play, NATO had a role

39:35.520 --> 39:43.200
 to play in the current war in Ukraine. Is there some truth to that when you think about it in

39:43.200 --> 39:50.480
 the context of World War I? Or is it purely about the specific parties involved, which is Russia

39:50.480 --> 39:59.680
 and Ukraine? I think it's very easy to draw parallels between World War I and the war in Ukraine,

40:01.920 --> 40:10.560
 but I don't think they really work. The First World War in some ways is generated by

40:10.560 --> 40:20.400
 a fundamental conflict in the European system of empires, in the global system of empires.

40:21.520 --> 40:27.040
 In many ways, if there's a parallel, the war in Ukraine is the parallel to some of the conflicts

40:27.040 --> 40:40.960
 in the Mediterranean and the Balkans in 1911 to 1913 that then later there was a much greater

40:40.960 --> 40:49.520
 conflict. If there's any lessons to be learned for how not to let World War III look like World

40:49.520 --> 40:57.760
 War I, it would be to make sure that systems aren't locked into place, that escalate wars out of

40:57.760 --> 41:05.840
 people's expectations. That's what I was implying, that this is the early stages of World War III,

41:06.560 --> 41:14.320
 that in the same way that several wolves are licking their chops or whatever the expression is,

41:14.320 --> 41:22.240
 because they're creating tension, they're creating military conflict with a kind of unstoppable

41:22.240 --> 41:31.760
 imperative for a global war. Many people that are looking at this are really worried about that.

41:31.760 --> 41:40.000
 Now, the forcing function to stop this war is that there's several nuclear powers involved,

41:40.000 --> 41:47.440
 which has at least for now worked to stop full on global war, but I'm not sure that's going to be

41:47.440 --> 41:56.000
 the case. In fact, what is one of the surprising things to me in Ukraine is that still in the 21st

41:56.000 --> 42:03.280
 century, we can go to something that involves nuclear powers, not directly yet, but awfully

42:03.280 --> 42:12.160
 close to directly, go to a hot war. Do you worry about that, that there's a kind of

42:12.960 --> 42:20.080
 descent into a World War I type of scenario? Yes. That keeps me up at night and I think it

42:20.080 --> 42:30.960
 should keep the citizens of both the United States and Russia up at night. Again, it gets

42:30.960 --> 42:40.640
 back to what I was saying in the summer of 1914. Even then, things that looked like a march toward

42:40.640 --> 42:49.520
 war could have been different. I think it's important for leaders of both countries and of

42:49.520 --> 42:56.160
 all of the related countries, of Ukraine, of the various NATO powers, to really imagine

42:56.160 --> 43:05.600
 off ramps and to imagine alternatives and to make them possible, whether it's through diplomacy,

43:05.600 --> 43:14.000
 whether it's through other formats. I think that that's the only way to prevent greater

43:14.000 --> 43:19.120
 escalation. What's the difference between World War I and the Civil War? In terms of how they

43:19.120 --> 43:26.320
 defined what it means to be an American, but also the American citizen's relationship with the war,

43:27.760 --> 43:32.160
 what the leaders were doing, is there interesting differences and similarities?

43:34.400 --> 43:38.320
 Besides the fact that everybody seems to have forgot about World War I in the United States

43:38.320 --> 43:46.800
 and everyone still remembers Civil War. I mean, it's true. The American Civil War

43:46.800 --> 43:52.560
 defines American identity in some ways, along with the Revolution and the Second World War,

43:53.520 --> 44:01.760
 more so than any other conflict. It's a fundamentally different war. It's one because it

44:01.760 --> 44:10.640
 is a civil war, because of secession, because of the Confederacy. This is a conflict happening

44:10.640 --> 44:17.280
 on the territory of the United States between Americans. The dynamics are really quite different.

44:19.360 --> 44:23.520
 The leaders, particularly Lincoln, have a different relationship to the home front,

44:23.520 --> 44:30.160
 to civilians than, say, Wilson or Roosevelt have in World War I and II.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.960
 Also, the way you would tell the story of the Civil War,

44:33.600 --> 44:36.080
 perhaps similar to the way we tell the story of World War II,

44:36.080 --> 44:41.760
 there's like a reason to actually fight the war. The way we tell the stories we're fighting for

44:41.760 --> 44:50.960
 this idea that all men are created equal, that the war is over slavery in part. Perhaps that's a

44:52.800 --> 44:57.440
 drastic oversimplification of what the war was actually about in the moment, like how do you

44:57.440 --> 45:05.760
 get pulled into an actual war versus a hot discussion. And the same with World War II,

45:05.760 --> 45:15.120
 people kind of frame the narrative that it was against evil, Hitler being evil. I think the key

45:15.120 --> 45:21.760
 part of that is probably the Holocaust, is how you can formulate Hitler's being evil. If there's no

45:21.760 --> 45:28.320
 Holocaust, perhaps there's a case to be made that we wouldn't see World War II as such, quote,

45:28.320 --> 45:33.840
 unquote, good war, that there's an atrocity that had to happen to make it really,

45:33.840 --> 45:40.240
 to be able to tell a clear narrative of why we get into this war. Perhaps such a narrative doesn't

45:40.240 --> 45:46.480
 exist for World War I. And so it doesn't stay in the American mind. We tried to sweep it under

45:46.480 --> 45:55.760
 the rug, given though overall 16 million people died. So to you, the difference is in the fact

45:55.760 --> 46:03.600
 that you're fighting for ideas and fighting on the homeland. But in terms of people's participation,

46:05.360 --> 46:09.840
 you know, fighting for your country, was there similarities there?

46:10.960 --> 46:17.360
 Yeah. I mean, I think, I mean, the Civil War in both the north and the south,

46:17.360 --> 46:23.760
 troops are raised overwhelmingly through volunteer recruitment. There is a draft in both the north

46:23.760 --> 46:32.800
 and the south, but you know, it's not significant. Only 8% of Confederate soldiers came in through

46:32.800 --> 46:43.120
 conscription. And so in fact, you know, the mobilization for volunteers often organized locally

46:43.120 --> 46:49.520
 around individual communities or states creates sort of multiple identities and levels of loyalty

46:49.520 --> 46:54.000
 where people both in the north and the south have loyalty both to their state regiments,

46:54.800 --> 47:00.960
 to their sort of community militias as well to the country. They are fighting over the country,

47:00.960 --> 47:07.280
 right, over the United States. And so the Union and the Confederacy have conflicting and ultimately

47:07.280 --> 47:16.400
 irreconcilable visions of that. But that sort of nationalism that comes out of the Union after

47:16.400 --> 47:20.960
 the victory and the war is a kind of crucial force shaping America ever since.

47:21.440 --> 47:26.160
 So what was the neutrality period? Why did US stay out of the war for so long? Like what was

47:26.160 --> 47:35.920
 going on in that interesting, like what made Woodrow Wilson change his mind? What was the

47:35.920 --> 47:43.840
 interesting dynamic there? I always say that the United States entered the war in April of 1917,

47:43.840 --> 47:49.840
 but Americans entered it right away, right? They entered it, you know, some of them actually went

47:49.840 --> 47:58.400
 and volunteered and fought almost exclusively on the side of Britain and France. At least 50,000

47:58.400 --> 48:05.280
 joined the Canadian army or the British army and serve. Millions volunteer, they sent humanitarian

48:05.280 --> 48:11.520
 aid. I think in many ways, modern war creates modern humanitarianism. And we can see that

48:11.520 --> 48:17.200
 in the neutrality period. And even if they wanted the United States to stay out of the war,

48:17.760 --> 48:22.640
 a lot of Americans get involved in it by thinking about it, caring about it, arguing about it.

48:24.000 --> 48:29.600
 And, you know, at the same time, they're worried that British propaganda is shaping their news

48:29.600 --> 48:36.640
 system. They are worried that German espionage is undermining them. They're worried that both

48:36.640 --> 48:41.440
 Britain and Germany are trying to interfere in American elections and American news cycles.

48:42.880 --> 48:47.920
 And at the same time, a revolution is breaking out in Mexico, right? So there are sort of,

48:47.920 --> 48:52.160
 you know, concerns about what's happening in the Western Hemisphere as well as what's happening in

48:52.160 --> 49:02.480
 Europe. So World War I was supposed to be the war to end all wars, and it didn't. How did World

49:02.480 --> 49:10.560
 War I pave the way to World War II? Every nation probably has their own story in this trajectory

49:10.560 --> 49:17.760
 towards World War II. How did Europe allow World War II to happen? How did the Soviet Union, Russia

49:19.120 --> 49:24.160
 allow World War II to happen? And how did America allow World War II to happen in Japan?

49:24.160 --> 49:29.280
 Yeah, you're right. The answer is different for each country, right? That in some ways,

49:29.280 --> 49:35.840
 in Germany, the culture of defeat and the experience of defeat at the end of World War I

49:35.840 --> 49:45.280
 leads to a culture of resentment, recrimination, finger pointing, blame that makes German politics

49:45.280 --> 49:50.720
 very ugly, as one person puts it, brutalizes German politics.

49:51.680 --> 49:56.160
 It places resentment at the core of the populace and its politics.

49:56.160 --> 50:02.880
 Yeah. And so in some ways, that lays the groundwork for the kind of politics of resentment and hate

50:02.880 --> 50:09.440
 that comes from the Nazis. For the United States, in some ways, the failure to win the peace

50:11.520 --> 50:18.720
 sets up the possibility for the next war, right? That the United States, through Wilson,

50:18.720 --> 50:24.880
 is sort of crafting a new international order in order that this will be the war to end all wars.

50:24.880 --> 50:30.720
 But because the United States failed to join the League of Nations, you see the United States

50:30.720 --> 50:36.560
 really sort of on the hook for another generation. In Asia, the story is more complicated, right?

50:36.560 --> 50:42.480
 And I think it's worth bearing that in mind that World War II is a two front war. It starts in Asia

50:42.480 --> 50:49.600
 for its own reasons. World War I is transformative for Japan. It is a time of massive economic

50:49.600 --> 50:57.040
 expansion. A lot of that sort of economic wealth is poured into sort of greater industrialization

50:57.040 --> 51:04.240
 and militarization. And so when the military wing in Japanese politics takes over in the 1930s,

51:04.240 --> 51:08.560
 there are in some ways flexing muscles that come out of the First World War.

51:09.440 --> 51:12.800
 Can you talk about the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles?

51:12.800 --> 51:23.760
 What's interesting about that dynamic there of the parties involved of how could have been

51:23.760 --> 51:28.160
 done differently to avoid the resentment? Is there, or again, is it inevitable?

51:30.160 --> 51:38.080
 So the war ends and very soon, even before the war is over, the United States in particular

51:38.080 --> 51:43.760
 is trying to shape the peace, right? And the United States is the central actor at the Paris

51:43.760 --> 51:50.320
 Peace Conference in 1919. Woodrow Wilson is there. He's presiding, and he knows that he calls the

51:50.320 --> 51:59.120
 shots. So he was respected? He was respected, but resentfully in some ways by the European powers,

51:59.120 --> 52:04.400
 Britain and France and Italy, to a lesser extent, who felt that they had sacrificed more.

52:04.400 --> 52:11.440
 They had two goals. They wanted to shape the imperial system in order to make sure that

52:11.440 --> 52:16.560
 their kind of fundamental economic structures wouldn't change. And they also wanted to

52:17.680 --> 52:24.960
 weaken Germany as much as possible so that Germany couldn't rise again. What this leads to is a

52:24.960 --> 52:31.120
 peace treaty that maintains some of the fundamental conflicts of the imperial system

52:31.120 --> 52:38.720
 and makes, bankrupts Germany, starves Germany and kind of feeds this politics of resentment

52:38.720 --> 52:44.880
 that make it impossible for Germany to kind of participate in a European order.

52:46.240 --> 52:54.160
 So people like historian Neil Ferguson, for example, make the case that if Britain stayed out of World War

52:54.160 --> 53:01.840
 I, we would have avoided this whole mess and we would potentially even avoid World War II. There's

53:01.840 --> 53:08.160
 kind of counterfactual history. Do you think it's possible to make the case for that? That there was

53:10.080 --> 53:15.200
 a moment, especially in that case, staying out of the war for Britain, that the escalation to a

53:15.200 --> 53:21.680
 global war could have been avoided, and one that ultimately ends in a deep global resentment. So

53:21.680 --> 53:28.080
 where Germany is resentful not just of France or particular nations, but is resentful of the entire,

53:29.200 --> 53:34.160
 I don't know how you define it, the West or something like this in the entire global world.

53:36.320 --> 53:47.280
 I wish it were that easy. And I think it's useful to think in counterfactuals,

53:47.280 --> 53:55.920
 you know, what if, and if you believe as historians do in causation, then if that one thing causes

53:55.920 --> 54:00.560
 another, then you also have to believe in counterfactuals, right, that if something hadn't

54:00.560 --> 54:07.840
 happened, then maybe that wouldn't, you know, that would have worked differently. But I think all the

54:07.840 --> 54:14.800
 things that led to World War I are multi causal and nuance. And this is what historians do. We make

54:14.800 --> 54:19.520
 things more complicated. And so, you know, there was no one thing that could have, you know,

54:21.040 --> 54:27.680
 that could have turned the tide of history, you know, and, you know, oh, if only Hitler had gotten

54:27.680 --> 54:34.240
 into art school, or if only Fidel Castro had gotten into the major leagues, you know, those are

54:34.240 --> 54:39.120
 interesting thought experiments, but few, few events in history, I think are that contingent.

54:39.120 --> 54:46.400
 Well, if there's an example of somebody who's a charismatic leader that seems to have a really

54:48.560 --> 54:56.880
 disproportionate amount of influence on the tide of history. So, you know, if you look at Stalin,

54:56.880 --> 55:04.000
 you could imagine that many other people could have stepped into that role. And the same goes for

55:04.000 --> 55:11.360
 many of the other presidents through, or even Mao. It seems that there's a singular nature to Hitler,

55:11.360 --> 55:17.600
 that you could play the counterfactual, that if there was no Hitler, you may have not had World

55:17.600 --> 55:25.200
 War II. He, better than many leaders in history, was able to channel the resentment of the populace

55:26.240 --> 55:33.760
 into a very aggressive expansion of the military and I would say skillful deceit of the

55:33.760 --> 55:41.840
 entire world in terms of his plans and was able to effectively start the war. So, is it possible that,

55:43.920 --> 55:49.280
 I mean, could Hitler have been stopped? Could we have avoided if he just got into art school?

55:49.280 --> 55:55.600
 Right. Or again, do you feel like there's a current of events that was unstoppable?

55:55.600 --> 56:01.120
 I mean, part of what you're talking about is, is Hitler the individual as a sort of charismatic

56:01.120 --> 56:08.320
 leader who's able to mobilize the nation. And part of it is Hitlerism, right? His own sort of

56:08.320 --> 56:15.440
 individual ability to play, for example, play off his subordinates against one another to set up a

56:15.440 --> 56:22.400
 system of that nature that in some ways escalates violence, including the violence that leads to

56:22.400 --> 56:29.680
 the Holocaust. And some of it is also Hitlerism as a leader cult. And we see this in many other

56:29.680 --> 56:36.160
 sort of, you know, things where a political movement surrounds one particular individual

56:36.160 --> 56:43.600
 who may or may not be replaceable. So, yes, the World War II we got would have been completely

56:43.600 --> 56:52.160
 different if a different sort of faction had risen to power in Germany. But Europe, you know,

56:52.160 --> 56:58.160
 depression era Europe was so unstable and democracies collapsed throughout Western Europe over the

56:58.160 --> 57:03.760
 course of the 1930s, you know, whether they had charismatic totalitarian leaders or not.

57:05.280 --> 57:10.640
 Have you actually read one book I just recently finished? I'd love to get your opinion

57:11.360 --> 57:17.040
 from a historian perspective. There's a book called Blitzed Drugs in the Third Reich by Norman Oler.

57:17.040 --> 57:27.840
 It makes a case that drugs played a very large myth, essentially, played a very large role in

57:27.840 --> 57:35.120
 World War II. There's a lot of criticism of this book saying that it's kind of to what you're saying.

57:35.680 --> 57:41.200
 It takes this one little variable and makes it like this explains everything. So everything

57:41.200 --> 57:47.920
 about Hitler, everything about the Blitzkrieg, everything about the military, the way, the strategy,

57:47.920 --> 57:52.000
 the decisions could be explained through drugs or at least implies that kind of thing.

57:54.160 --> 57:58.880
 And the interesting thing about this book because Hitler and Nazi Germany is one of the most sort

57:58.880 --> 58:05.120
 of written about periods of human history. And this was not drugs were almost entirely not written

58:05.120 --> 58:11.520
 about in this context. So here along this semi historian, because I don't think he's even a

58:11.520 --> 58:18.240
 historian. He's a lot of his work is fiction. Hopefully I'm saying that correctly. So he tells

58:18.240 --> 58:23.680
 a really, that's one of the criticisms. He tells a very compelling story that drugs were at the center

58:23.680 --> 58:33.920
 of this period and also of the man of Hitler. What are your sort of feelings and thoughts about

58:35.520 --> 58:39.920
 if you've gotten a chance to read this book, but I'm sure there's books like it that tell

58:39.920 --> 58:46.480
 an interesting perspective, singular perspective on a war? Yeah, I mean, I have read it. And I

58:46.480 --> 58:51.040
 also had this sort of eye opening experience that a lot of historians did. And they're like,

58:51.040 --> 59:00.320
 why didn't we think about this? And I think whether the author older is sort of not a

59:00.320 --> 59:05.280
 trained academic historian, but the joy of history is you don't have to be one to write good history.

59:05.280 --> 59:14.800
 And I don't think anyone sort of criticizes him for that. I like the book as a window into the

59:14.800 --> 59:24.560
 Third Reich. Of course, drugs don't explain all of it, but it helps us see the people who supported

59:24.560 --> 59:33.840
 Hitler, the ways in which it was that mind altering and performance altering drugs were used to kind

59:33.840 --> 59:42.960
 of keep soldiers on the battlefield, the ways in which I think that we don't fully understand

59:42.960 --> 59:50.240
 the extent to which the Third Reich is held together with duct tape from a pretty early phase

59:50.240 --> 59:58.000
 by like 1940 or 41 even. It's all smoke and mirrors. And I think that wartime propaganda,

59:58.000 --> 1:00:03.200
 both Germans trying to say, we're winning everything and America trying to mobilize

1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:10.480
 and the other allies to mobilize against Germany, described a more formidable enemy than it really

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:17.920
 was by 1941 and 42. Yeah, I mean, I could see both cases. One is that duct tape doesn't make the man,

1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:25.360
 but also as an engineer, I'm a huge fan of duct tape because it does seem to solve a lot of problems.

1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:34.320
 And I do worry that this perspective that the book presents about drugs is somehow to the mind

1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:41.360
 really compelling because it's almost like the mind or at least my mind searches for an answer.

1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:46.960
 How could this have happened? And it's nice to have a clean explanation. And drugs is one

1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:52.080
 popular one when people talk about steroids and sports. The moment you introduce the topic of

1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:58.640
 steroids, somehow the mind wants to explain all success in the context was because this person

1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:06.800
 was on steroids, Lance Armstrong. Well, it's like it's a very sticky idea. Certain ideas,

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:11.760
 certain explanations are very sticky. And I think that's really dangerous because then you lose the

1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:16.960
 full context. And also in the case of drugs, it removes the responsibility from the person,

1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:26.160
 both for the military genius and the evil. And I think it's a very dangerous thing to do.

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:29.920
 Because something about the mind, maybe it's just mine, it's sticky to this. Well,

1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:36.400
 drugs explain it. If the drugs didn't happen, then it will be very different. It worries me

1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:43.760
 how compelling it is of an explanation. So that's why it's maybe better to think of it as a window

1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:48.880
 into the third rank than an explanation of it. But it's also a nice exploration of Hitler the

1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:55.120
 man. For some reason, discussing his habits, especially later in the war, his practices with

1:01:55.120 --> 1:02:02.560
 drugs gives you a window into the person. It reminds you that this is a human being,

1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:09.760
 like a human being that gets emotional in the morning, gets thoughtful in the morning, hopeful,

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:18.480
 sad, depressed, angry, like a story of emotions of the human being. Somehow we construct a,

1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:24.320
 which is a pretty dangerous thing to do, we construct an evil monster out of Hitler when in

1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:28.800
 reality, he's a human being like all of us. I think the lesson there is the soldier instant

1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:37.600
 lesson, which is all of us to some degree are capable of evil. Or maybe if you want to make

1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:44.400
 a less powerful statement, many of our leaders are capable of evil, that this Hitler is not

1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:51.040
 truly singular in history. That yeah, when the resentment of the populace matches the right

1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:57.600
 charismatic leader, it's easy to make the kind of not easy, but it's possible to frequently make

1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:06.160
 the kind of initiation of military conflict that happened in World War II. By the way,

1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:15.120
 because you said not a trained historian, one of the most compelling and, I don't know, entertaining

1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:20.160
 and fascinating exploration of World War I comes from Dan Collins. I don't know if you've

1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:27.760
 gotten a chance to listen to his sort of podcast form telling of the blueprint for Armageddon,

1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:32.480
 which is the telling of World War I. What do you think about Dan Collins? You yourself,

1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:38.560
 as a historian who has studied, who has written about World War I, do you enjoy that kind of

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:45.520
 telling of history? Absolutely. And I think, again, you know, you don't need a PhD in history to be

1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:50.800
 a historian. Does every historian agree with that? He gets quite a bit of criticism from historians.

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:58.160
 We like to argue with each other and stick with each other, but the one thing I have no patience

1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:07.520
 for is when we pull rank on each other. I think we depend on, if you're a historian in a university

1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:13.360
 with degrees and research materials, you depend on the work of people in some local community,

1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:20.080
 like recording oral history, saving documents. And history is a social science, but it's also

1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:26.880
 a storytelling art. And history books are the ones you find on the shelves and bookstores

1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:34.080
 that people read for fun. And you can appreciate both the knowledge production as well as the

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:40.400
 storytelling. And when you get a good oral storyteller like Dan Carlin, there's a reason

1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:45.680
 that thousands and hundreds of thousands of people tune in. Yeah, but he definitely suffers

1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:51.120
 from anxiety about getting things corrected. It's very difficult. Well, our first job is to

1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:58.880
 get the facts correct and then to tell the story off of those. The facts are so fuzzy. So it's,

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:06.160
 I mean, you have the probably my favorite telling of World War II is William Shire's

1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:12.560
 Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, and or at least not telling of Nazi Germany. And that

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:21.120
 goes to primary sources a lot, which is like, I suppose that's the honest way to do it.

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:26.880
 But it's tough. It's really tough to write that way, to really go to primary sources

1:05:28.720 --> 1:05:31.520
 always. And I think the one of the things that Dan tries to do,

1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:40.720
 which is also really tough to do, perhaps easier in oral history, is try to make you feel what it

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:48.880
 was like to be there, which I think he does by trying to tell the story of like individual soldiers.

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:56.640
 Do you find that telling like individual citizens, do you find that kind of telling of

1:05:56.640 --> 1:06:05.440
 history compelling? Yeah, I mean, I think we need historical imagination. And I think

1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:10.560
 historical imagination teaches something very valuable, which is humility,

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:19.200
 to realize that there are other people who've lived on this planet, and they organized their

1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:28.240
 lives differently, and they made it through just fine too. And I think that that kind of

1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:35.600
 meeting other people from the past can be actually a very useful skill for meeting

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:40.560
 people unlike you in the present. Unlike you, but also like you. I think both are

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:48.240
 humbling, one realizing that they lived in a different space and time, but two realizing that

1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:53.760
 if you were placed in that space and time, you might have done all the same things,

1:06:53.760 --> 1:07:00.720
 whether it's the brave good thing or the evil thing. Yeah, absolutely. And you get also a sense

1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:08.480
 of possibility. There's this famous line that those who do not learn history are condemned to

1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:14.400
 repeat it. But I think the other half is true as well, which is those who do not learn history

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:19.360
 don't get the chance to repeat it. We're not the first people on this planet to face

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:26.000
 any certain kinds of problems. Other people have lived through worlds like this one before.

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:30.480
 It's like when you fall in love as a teenager for the first time, and then there's a breakup,

1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:38.080
 you think it's the greatest tragedy that has ever happened in the world. You're the first person.

1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:45.440
 And even though like Romeo and Juliet and so on had had this issue, you're the first person that

1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:52.400
 truly feels the catastrophic heartbreak of that experience. It's good to be reminded that no,

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:58.320
 the human condition is what it is. We have lived through it at the individual and the societal

1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:06.000
 scale. Let me ask you about nationalism, which I think is at the core of I want you poster.

1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:12.880
 Is nationalism destructive or empowering to a nation? And we can use different

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:19.440
 words like patriotism, which is in many ways synonymous to nationalism. But in recent history,

1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:27.040
 perhaps because of the Nazis, has slowly parted ways that somehow nationalism is when patriotism

1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:36.000
 and patriotism have gone bad or something like this. Yeah, they're different. Patriotism is

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:43.200
 in some ways best thought of as an emotion and a feeling of love of country, literally.

1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:50.080
 And in some ways that's a necessary condition to participate in nationalism.

1:08:50.080 --> 1:09:00.480
 You know, whether to me, I think nationalism is crucial in a world organized around nation

1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:07.120
 states. And you have to sort of believe that you are engaged in a common project together.

1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:13.680
 Right. And so, you know, in the contemporary United States, you know, in some ways that that

1:09:13.680 --> 1:09:18.880
 question is actually on the table in ways that it hasn't been in the past. But you have to believe

1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:22.160
 that you're engaged in a common project that you have something in common

1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:29.200
 with the person with whom you share this nation and that you would sacrifice for them,

1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:33.600
 whether it's by paying taxes for them or, you know, we're going to war to defend them.

1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:40.480
 That's a vision of, you know, what we might call civic nationalism. That's the good version.

1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:48.160
 The question is whether you could have that without having exclusionary nationalism, you know,

1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:53.680
 hating the other, right, fearing the other, saying, yeah, you're part of this nation

1:09:54.480 --> 1:10:01.040
 against all others. And I think there's a long tradition in America of a very inclusive

1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:10.320
 nationalism that is open, inclusive, welcoming, and, you know, new people to this shared project.

1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:17.280
 That's something to be defended. Exclusionary nationalism is based on, you know, ethnic

1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:21.600
 hatreds and others that we see throughout the world. And those are things to be afraid of.

1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:28.960
 But there is a kind of narrative in the United States that a nationalism that includes the big

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:35.760
 umbrella of democratic nations, nations that strive for freedom, and everybody else is against,

1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:41.440
 is against freedom and against human nature. And it just so happens that it's a half and half split

1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:48.640
 across the world. So that's imperialism. That feels like it beats the drum of war.

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.320
 Yeah. And I mean, I don't want to paint too rosy a picture. And certainly, you know, the United

1:10:54.320 --> 1:11:00.800
 States as a nation has often found it easier to define ourselves against something than to

1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:09.760
 clarify exactly what we're for. Yeah. Yeah. The Cold War, China today.

1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:14.880
 That's not only the United States, I suppose that's human nature.

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:21.920
 It's we need a competitor. It's almost like maybe the success of human civilization requires

1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:31.840
 figuring out how to construct competitors that don't result in global war.

1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:40.800
 Yes, or figuring out how to turn enemies into rivals and competitors. There's a real difference.

1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:46.400
 You know, you can you, you know, you compete with competitors, you, you fight with enemies.

1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:52.560
 Yeah. With competitors as a respect, maybe even a love underlying the competition.

1:11:55.680 --> 1:11:59.360
 What lessons, what are the biggest lessons you take away from World War One?

1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:05.360
 Maybe we talked about several, but you know, you look back at the 20th century, what

1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:14.000
 as a historian, what do you learn about human nature, about human civilization,

1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:28.480
 about history from looking at this war? I think the lesson I would want everyone to take from

1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:39.760
 the story of the First World War is that human life is not cheap, that all of the warring powers

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:47.440
 thought that just by throwing more men and more material at the front, they would solve their

1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:55.360
 political problems with military force. And at the end of the day in 1918, one side did win that,

1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:59.280
 but it didn't actually solve any of those political problems.

1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:05.280
 And in the end, the regular people paid the price of their lives?

1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:10.720
 Yes, they did. And people who, people who had been told that their lives were cheap,

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:18.400
 remembered that, right? And it sort of, you know, reshapes mass politics for the rest of

1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:25.120
 the 20th century, both in Europe and around the world. Yeah, the, yeah, the cost of a death of a

1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:31.360
 single soldier is not just, or a single civilian is not just the cost of that single life. It's

1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:38.720
 the resentment that the anger, the hate that reverberates throughout. One of the things I saw

1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:47.440
 in Ukraine is the birth of a scale of generational hate, not towards administrations or leaders,

1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:54.240
 but towards entire peoples. And that hate, I mean, overnight that hate is created,

1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:57.440
 and it takes perhaps decades for that hate to dissipate.

1:13:57.440 --> 1:14:03.520
 It takes decades, and it takes, it takes collective effort to build institutions that

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:08.400
 divert that, that hate into, into other places.

1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:17.200
 One of the biggest things I thought was not part of the calculus in when the United States invaded

1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:27.760
 Afghanistan and Iraq is the creation of hate. When you, when you drop a bomb, even if it hits

1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:34.960
 military targets, even if it kills soldiers, which in that case, it didn't. There's a very

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:45.280
 large amount of civilians. What does that do to the, you know, like, how many years, minutes,

1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:50.240
 hours, months, and years of hate do you create with a single bomb? You drop and they calculate

1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:57.440
 that literally in the Pentagon have a chart. How many people will hate us? How many people

1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:02.240
 does it take to some science here? How many people does it take when you have a million people that

1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:12.240
 hate you? How many of them will become terrorists? How many of them will do something to the nation

1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:17.120
 you love and care about, which is the United States, will do something that will be very costly?

1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:23.840
 I feel like there was not a plot and a chart. It was more about short term effects.

1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:30.880
 Yes. It's again, it's the idea of using military force to solve political problems.

1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:35.200
 And I think there's a squandering of, of goodwill that people have around the world

1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:40.560
 toward the United States. You know, that's a respect for, you know, for its economy,

1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:46.080
 for its consumer products and so forth. And I think that's, that's been lost a lot of that.

1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:51.200
 Do you think leaders can stop war? I have perhaps a romantic notion, perhaps,

1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:55.760
 because I do these podcasts in person and so on, that leaders that get in a room together and can

1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:02.880
 talk, they can stop war. I mean, that's the power of a leader, especially one with a,

1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:13.280
 in an authoritarian regime, that they can, through camaraderie, alleviate some of the

1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:20.320
 emotions associated with the ego. Yes. Leaders can stop war if they get into the room

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:29.520
 when they understand from the masses in their countries that war is something that they want

1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:34.480
 stopped. So the people ultimately have a really big say.

1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:40.960
 They do. You know, that it was mass movements by people in the United States for the nuclear

1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:48.800
 freeze in Russia pushing for openness that brought, for example, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:55.040
 to Reykjavik to sort of debate, you know, and eventually sort of put caps on nuclear weapons.

1:16:55.040 --> 1:17:00.160
 You know, those two people did, you know, made choices in the room that made that possible,

1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:06.800
 but they were both being pushed and knew they were being pushed by their people.

1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:13.520
 Boy, that's a tough one. It puts a lot of responsibility on the German people, for example.

1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:22.640
 In both wars, we fans of history tend to conceive of history as a meeting of leaders.

1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:27.760
 We think of Chamberlain. We think of Churchill and the importance of them in the Second World War.

1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:31.760
 We think about Hitler and Stalin and think that if certain conversations happened,

1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:39.040
 the war could have been avoided. You tell the story of how many times Hitler and Nazi

1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:44.000
 Germany's military might was not sufficient. They could have been easily stopped.

1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:52.480
 And the pacifists, the people who believed Hitler or foolish enough to believe Hitler

1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:56.640
 didn't act properly. And if the leaders just woke up to that idea,

1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:04.560
 in fact, Churchill is a kind of representation of that. But in your conception here,

1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:08.000
 it's possible that Churchill was also a representation of the British people,

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:17.200
 even though seemingly unpopular. That force was... They gave birth to somebody like Churchill,

1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:21.680
 who said, we'll never surrender, right? She'll fight in the beaches.

1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:31.520
 I think World War II Britain is a good example of that. It is clearly a dynamic leader who has

1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:40.080
 his pulse on what the people want and demand and are willing to do. And it's a dynamic art of

1:18:40.080 --> 1:18:46.080
 leading that and shaping those wants at the same time as knowing that you're bound by them.

1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:51.920
 Well, then if we can see your history in this way, let me ask you about our presidents.

1:18:53.040 --> 1:19:01.040
 You are taking on the impossibly difficult task of teaching a course in a couple of years here,

1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:04.880
 or in one year, called the history of American presidential elections.

1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:10.400
 So if the people are in part responsible for leaders,

1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:18.800
 how can we explain what is going on in America that we have the leaders that we do today?

1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:24.720
 So if we think about the elections of the past several cycles,

1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:32.480
 I guess let me ask, are we a divided nation? Are we more of a divided nation that were in the past?

1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:37.680
 What do you understand about the American citizen in the beginning of this century

1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:41.120
 from the leaders we have elected?

1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:51.760
 Yes, obviously, we are a divided country in our rhetoric, in our day to day politics.

1:19:51.760 --> 1:20:01.600
 But we are nowhere near as divided as we have been in other periods in our history.

1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:06.480
 The most obvious, of course, being the American Civil War 150 years ago.

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:16.640
 And the distinction is not just that we haven't come to blows, but that we are fundamentally

1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:27.680
 one society, one economy, and deeply integrated as a nation, both domestically and on the world stage

1:20:27.680 --> 1:20:33.200
 in ways that look nothing like the United States in 1861.

1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:43.840
 Will political rhetoric continue to be extreme? Of course, but we are not as divided as people

1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:54.640
 think we are. Well, then if you actually look throughout human history, does it always get

1:20:54.640 --> 1:20:59.920
 so outside of the people that do the elections get as contentious as they've recently been?

1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:04.720
 So there's a kind of perception that has been very close and there's

1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:10.560
 a lot of accusations and a lot of tensions. It's very heated. It's almost fueling the machine

1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:18.480
 of division. Has that often been the case? It has. It hasn't. I mean, I do think right now

1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:25.520
 is different. And there it's worth distinguishing, are there deep social or economic divisions,

1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:30.160
 which I don't actually think that there are, versus partisanship in particular,

1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:35.760
 sort of the rivalry between the two parties. And it's very clear that we are in an era of

1:21:35.760 --> 1:21:41.120
 what political scientists call hyperpartisanship, and that the two parties have taken

1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:47.920
 fundamentally different positions and moved further apart from one another.

1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:56.800
 And that is what I think people talk about when they say our country is divided. So the country

1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:03.200
 may not be divided even if our politics are highly partisan. That is a divergence from

1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:08.880
 other time periods in our history. So I wonder if this kind of political partisanship

1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:20.480
 is actually an illusion of division. I sometimes feel like we mostly all agree on some basic

1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:28.960
 fundamentals. And the things that people allegedly disagree on are really blown out of proportion.

1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:33.920
 And there's like a media machine, and the politicians really want you to pick a blue side

1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:40.640
 and a red side. And because of that, somehow, I mean, families break up over Thanksgiving dinner

1:22:40.640 --> 1:22:47.520
 about who they voted for. There's a really strong pressure to be the red or blue. And I wonder if

1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:53.920
 that's a feature or a bug, whether this is just part of the mechanism of democracy that we want to,

1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:59.360
 even if there's not a real thing to be divided over, we need to construct it such that you can

1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:07.120
 always have a tension of ideas in order to make progress, to figure out how to progress as a nation.

1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:13.600
 I think we're figuring that out in real time. On the one hand, it's easy to say that it's a

1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:21.920
 feature of a political system that has two parties. And the United States is in some ways

1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:28.960
 unique in not being a parliamentary democracy. And so in some ways, you would think that would

1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:37.520
 be the feature that is causing partisanship and to reach these heights. That said, we can even

1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:45.680
 see in parliamentary systems all around the world that the same kinds of rhetorics of

1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:53.600
 irreconcilable division, politics of emotion are proliferating around the world. Some of that,

1:23:54.320 --> 1:24:03.360
 as you say, I think is not as real as it appears on television, on social media, and other formats.

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:09.760
 So I don't know that other countries that are experiencing political conflict,

1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:18.720
 I'm not sure that they're deeply divided either. So I've had the fortune of being intellectually

1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:26.400
 active through the George Bush versus Al Gore election, then the Obama and just every election

1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:33.760
 since. And it seems like a large percentage of those elections, there's been a claim that the

1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:42.880
 elections were rigged, that there is some conspiracy, corruption, malevolence on the other side.

1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:50.800
 I distinctly remember when Donald Trump won in 2016, a lot of people I know said that election

1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:58.800
 was rigged. And there's different explanations, including Russian influence. And then in 2020,

1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:04.960
 I was just running in Austin, along the river. And somebody said like, oh, huge fan

1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:09.840
 of the podcast. And they said, like, what do you think of this is just not right? What's

1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:18.160
 happening in this country? That the 2020 election was obviously rigged from their perspective in

1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:27.040
 electing Joe Biden versus Donald Trump. Do you think there's a case to be made for and against

1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:32.880
 each claim in the full context of history of our elections being rigged?

1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:43.280
 I think the American election system is fundamentally sound and reliable.

1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:55.600
 And I think that the evidence is clear for that, regardless of which election you're looking at

1:25:55.600 --> 1:26:01.600
 in some ways, whether you look at a presidential election or even a local county election for

1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:11.520
 dog catcher or something, that the amount of time and resources and precision that go into

1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:21.440
 voter registration, vote counting, certification processes are crucial to democratic institutions.

1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:28.640
 I think when someone says rigged, regardless of which side of the political spectrum they're

1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:38.880
 coming from, they're looking for an answer. They're looking for that one answer for what is, in fact,

1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:48.480
 a complex system. So on the left, when they say rigged, they may be pointing to a wide range

1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:58.480
 of ways in which they think that the system is tilted through gerrymandering,

1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:05.920
 misrepresentation through the electoral college. On the right, when people say rigged, they may

1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:16.640
 be concerned about voter security, about ways in which the mainstream media may control

1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:28.160
 messages, and in which, in both cases, the feeling is it's articulated as my vote didn't get counted

1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:37.200
 right. But the deeper concern is my vote doesn't count. My voice isn't being heard.

1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:41.920
 So no, I don't think the elections are rigged.

1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:48.240
 So let me push back. There's a comfort to the story that they're not rigged,

1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:55.920
 and a lot of us like to live in comfort. So people who articulate conspiracy theories say,

1:27:55.920 --> 1:28:01.440
 sure, it's nice to be comfortable, but here's the reality. And the thing they articulate is

1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:06.720
 there's incentives in close elections, which we seem to have not stop close elections.

1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:13.440
 There's so many financial interests. There's so many powerful people. Surely you can construct,

1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:17.920
 not just with the media, and all the ways you describe both on the left and the right,

1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:24.880
 the elections could be rigged, but literally, actually, in a fully illegal way,

1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:31.840
 manipulate the results of votes. Surely there's incentive to do that.

1:28:31.840 --> 1:28:39.760
 And I don't think that's a totally ridiculous argument, because it's like, all right, well,

1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:47.920
 I mean, it actually lands to the question, which is a hard question for me to ask,

1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:55.280
 as an optimist, of how many malevolent people out there and how many malevolent people are

1:28:55.280 --> 1:29:05.440
 required to rig an election? What is the phase transition for a system to become from corruption

1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:12.320
 light to high level of corruption, such that you could do things like rig elections,

1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:19.360
 which is what happens quite a lot in many nations in the world even today?

1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:24.480
 So yes, there is interference in elections, and there has been in American history,

1:29:24.480 --> 1:29:31.440
 and we can go all the way back into the 18th century. You don't have to go back to Texas in

1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:39.200
 the 1960s at an LBJ to find examples of direct interference in the outcome of elections,

1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:45.920
 and there are incentives to do that. Those incentives will only feel more existential

1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:55.120
 as hyperpartisanship makes people think that the outcome of the elections are a matter of

1:29:55.680 --> 1:30:05.680
 black and white or life and death. And you will see people organizing every way they can

1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:13.680
 to shape elections. We saw this in the 1850s, when settlers, pro and anti slavery, flooded into

1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:21.360
 Kansas to try to determine the outcome of an election. We see this in the reconstruction

1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:28.240
 period, when the Ku Klux Klan shows up to block the doors for black voters in the south.

1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:39.840
 This history is not new, it's there. I think the reason why I think that the system is sound

1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:46.160
 is not, or the reason, when I say I believe that the election system is fundamentally sound,

1:30:47.040 --> 1:30:54.640
 it's not, I'm not trying to be reassuring or encourage complacency. I'm saying this is

1:30:54.640 --> 1:31:03.280
 something that we need to do and to work on. So the current electoral mechanisms are sufficiently

1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:08.960
 robust, even if there is corruption, even if there is rigging, they're like the force that

1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:14.720
 corrects itself, self corrects and ensures that nobody gets out of line is much stronger than

1:31:14.720 --> 1:31:19.200
 the other incentives, which are like the corrupting incentives. And that's the thing I

1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:24.320
 talked about corrupt, you know, visiting Ukraine talking about corruption,

1:31:24.960 --> 1:31:30.880
 where a lot of people talk about corruption as being a symptom, not if the system allows

1:31:32.560 --> 1:31:37.920
 creates the incentives for there to be corruption, humans will always go for corruption.

1:31:37.920 --> 1:31:42.080
 That's just you have to assume that the power of the United States is that it constructed

1:31:42.080 --> 1:31:47.200
 systems that prevent you from being corrupted scale, at least I mean, depends what you believe,

1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:53.280
 but most of us, if you believe in this country, you have to, you believe in the in the self

1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:59.760
 correcting mechanisms of corruption, that even if that desire is in the human heart,

1:31:59.760 --> 1:32:09.200
 the system resist it prevents it. That's your current belief. Yes, as of today,

1:32:09.840 --> 1:32:18.480
 but I do, you know, I do think that those, you know, that will require oversight by institutions,

1:32:18.480 --> 1:32:23.600
 ideally ones that are insulated as much as possible from partisan politics, which is very

1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:31.920
 difficult right now. And it will require the demands of the American people that they want

1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:39.680
 these elections to be fair and secure. And that means, you know, that means being willing

1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:43.760
 to lose them, you know, regardless of which party you're in favor of.

1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:48.320
 So what do you think about the power of the media to create partisanship? I'm really worried

1:32:48.320 --> 1:32:55.680
 that there's a huge incentive, speaking of incentives to divide the country in the media

1:32:55.680 --> 1:32:59.520
 and the politicians, I'm not sure where it originates, but it feels like it's the media.

1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:04.560
 Maybe it's a very cynical perspective on journalism, but it seems like if we're

1:33:04.560 --> 1:33:09.600
 angry and divided as evenly as possible, you're going to maximize the number of clicks.

1:33:10.160 --> 1:33:13.600
 So it's almost like the media wants to elect people that are going to be the most

1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:26.160
 divisive maximizing. And the worry I have is they are not beyond either feeding or,

1:33:26.160 --> 1:33:32.160
 if you want to be very cynical, manufacturing narratives that lead that division, like the

1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:37.040
 narrative of an election being rigged. Because if you convinced half the populace that the

1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:42.080
 election was completely rigged, that's a really good way to get a lot of clicks.

1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:48.240
 And like the very cynical view is I don't know if the media machine

1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:57.600
 will stop the destruction of our democracy in service of getting more clicks.

1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:05.920
 It may destroy our entire democracy just to get more clicks, just because the fire as the thing

1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:14.240
 burns down will get clicks. Am I putting too much blame on the media here, the machine of it?

1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:20.080
 You're diagnosing the incentive structure. You're depicting that with 100% accuracy.

1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:29.120
 But I think history teaches that you might be giving the media too much causal power.

1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:35.680
 That the American people are smarter than the media that they consume.

1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:44.960
 Even today, we know that. Even people who consume just Fox or just MSNBC

1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:54.000
 know what they're consuming. And so I don't think that media will be the solution.

1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:01.520
 And I certainly don't think that returning to a media structure of the mid 20th century with

1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:08.800
 three news channels that all tell us one story, that's no golden age that we're trying to get back

1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:16.960
 to for sure. Well, there is a novel thing in human history, which is Twitter and social media and so

1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:22.400
 on. So we're trying to find our footing as a nation to figure out how to think about

1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:33.280
 politics, how to maintain our basic freedoms, our sense of democracy, of our interaction

1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:38.320
 with government, and so on on this new media, where medium of social media.

1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:44.480
 Do you think Twitter, how do you think Twitter changed things? Do you think Twitter is good

1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:50.400
 for democracy? Do you think it has changed what it means to be an American citizen?

1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:58.320
 Or is it just the same old media mechanism? It has not changed what it means to be an American

1:35:58.320 --> 1:36:10.480
 citizen. It may have changed the day to day sound of being and the experience of it. It's

1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:21.440
 got noisier, it got louder, and it got more decentered. I think Twitter, it's paradoxical. On the

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:28.720
 one hand, it is a fundamentally democratic platform. And in some ways it democratizes

1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:36.560
 institutions that had gatekeepers and authority figures for a very long time. But on the other

1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:42.080
 hand, it's not a democratic institution at all. It's a for profit corporation and it

1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:50.640
 operates under those principles. And so, that said, it's an institution of American and global life

1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:58.800
 that the people of the United States have the authority to regulate or reshape

1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:03.440
 as they see fit, both that and other major media players.

1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:08.160
 So, one of the most dramatic decisions that illustrate both sides of what you're saying

1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:13.440
 is when Twitter decided to ban, I think permanently, the president of the United

1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:21.040
 States, Donald Trump, off of Twitter. Can you make the case that that was a good idea and make

1:37:21.040 --> 1:37:24.800
 the case that that was a bad idea? Can you see both perspective on this?

1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:32.880
 Yes. I think, I mean, the simple fact of the matter is Twitter is a platform. It has rules

1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:39.520
 of service. Twitter concluded that President Trump had violated the terms of service and

1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:48.800
 blocked them. And if you have rules, you have to enforce them. Did it have consequences?

1:37:49.840 --> 1:38:02.080
 It had direct and predictable consequences of creating a sense among millions of Americans

1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:09.440
 that Twitter had taken aside in politics or confirming their belief that it had done so.

1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:15.040
 Will it have unintended consequences? This is where the historian can come in and say,

1:38:15.040 --> 1:38:23.200
 yes, there's always unintended consequences. And we don't know what it would mean for political

1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:34.720
 figures to be excluded from various media platforms under these notions of that they

1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:41.600
 had violated terms of service, et cetera. So, I guess we'll see as I would like.

1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:47.600
 Well, to me, so I'm generally against censorship, but to take Twitter's perspective,

1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:55.520
 it's unclear to me, in terms of unintended consequences, whether censoring a human being

1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:03.120
 from being part of your platform is going to decrease or increase the amount of hate in the

1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:11.040
 world. So, as a strong case to be made that banning somebody like Donald Trump increases the amount

1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:19.600
 of resentment among people and a very large number of people that support him or even love him

1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:23.440
 or even see him as a great president, one of the greatest this country has had.

1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:31.280
 And so, if you completely suppress his voice, you're going to intensify the support that he has

1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:38.000
 from just the regular support for another human being who ran for president to somebody that

1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:43.920
 becomes an almost heroic figure for that set of people. Now, the flip side is,

1:39:45.120 --> 1:39:52.480
 removing a person from a platform like Donald Trump might lessen the megaphone of that particular

1:39:52.480 --> 1:40:01.440
 person, might actually level the democratic notion that everybody has a voice. So, basically,

1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:10.000
 removing the loud extremes is helpful for giving the center the calm, the thoughtful voices more

1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:16.000
 power. And so, in that sense, that teaches a lesson that don't be crazy in any one direction.

1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:25.680
 Don't go full, don't go Lenin, don't go Hitler, don't like you have to stay in the middle. There's

1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:30.480
 divisions in the middle, there's discussions in the middle, but stay in the middle. That's sort of

1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:40.160
 the steelman in the case for censoring. But boy is censorship a slippery slope. And also,

1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:47.040
 boy is Twitter becoming a thing that's more than just a company. It seems like it's a medium of

1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:56.720
 communication that we use for information, for knowledge, for wisdom even. During the period

1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:03.440
 of COVID, we used it to gain an understanding of what the hell's going on. What should we do?

1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:07.920
 What's the state of the art science? Science fundamentally transformed during the time of

1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:12.640
 COVID because you have no time for the full review cycle that science usually goes through.

1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:18.560
 And some of the best sources of information for me, from the conspiracy theory to the

1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:25.120
 best doctors was Twitter. The data, the stats, all that kind of stuff. And that feels like more

1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:30.960
 than a company. And then Twitter and YouTube in different places took a really strong stance on

1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:38.320
 COVID, which is the lazy stance in my opinion, which is we're going to listen to whatever CDC

1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:45.040
 or the institutions have said. But the reality is you're an institution of your own now. You're

1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:54.800
 kind of the press. There's a really difficult position. It's a really, really difficult

1:41:54.800 --> 1:42:00.640
 position to take. But I wish they have stepped up and take on the full responsibility and the

1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:13.760
 pain of fighting for the freedom of speech. Yes, they need to do that. But I'm struck by

1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:20.800
 some of the things that you said, ways in which Twitter has the power to shape the conversation.

1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:28.800
 And I don't think in a democratic society, democratic polities should seed that power

1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:37.920
 to for profit companies. Do you agree that it's possible that Twitter has that power currently?

1:42:37.920 --> 1:42:42.160
 Do you sense that it has the power? Is that my sense is Twitter has the power to start wars,

1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:48.880
 like tweets have the power to start wars, to change the direction of elections?

1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:58.480
 Maybe in the sense in the ways in which a wave has the power to wash away sand. It's still the

1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:06.480
 medium. It's not in itself an actor. It's how actors use the platform, which requires us to

1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:10.560
 scrutinize the structure of the platform and access to it. Unfortunately, it's not maybe

1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:18.880
 as similar to the wave. It's not just a medium. It's a medium plus. It's a medium that enables

1:43:18.880 --> 1:43:26.400
 virality, that benefits from virality of engagement. And that means singular voices

1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:36.480
 can have a disproportionate impact. Not even voices, singular ideas, dramatic ideas can have

1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:42.560
 a disproportionate impact. And so that actually threatens, it's almost like, I don't know what

1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:49.040
 the equivalent is in nature, but it's a wave that can grow exponentially because of the intensity

1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:55.920
 of the initial intensity of the wave. I don't know how to describe this as a dynamical system,

1:43:55.920 --> 1:44:04.560
 but it feels like there is a responsibility there not to accelerate voices just because

1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:08.720
 they get a lot of engagement. You have to have a proportional representation of that voice.

1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:14.800
 But you're saying that a strong democracy should be robust to that.

1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:21.280
 A strong democracy can and should and will be. I think the other thing a historian will tell

1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:30.640
 you about Twitter is that this too shall pass. But I do think the structures of the platform,

1:44:30.640 --> 1:44:39.920
 of the algorithm, of this and other major players are eligible for scrutiny by democratic

1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:46.320
 institutions. So in preparing to teach the course, the history of American presidential

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:53.440
 elections leading up to the 2024 elections, so one of the lessons of history is this too shall pass.

1:44:53.440 --> 1:44:59.120
 So don't make everything about, this is going to either save or destroy our nation. That seems

1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:07.040
 to be the message of every single election as I'm doing Trump hands. Do you think Donald Trump,

1:45:07.040 --> 1:45:13.200
 what do you think about the 2024 election? Do you think Donald Trump runs? Do you think the

1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:23.680
 tension will grow or was that a singular moment? Do you think you'll be like AOC versus Trump or

1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:29.120
 whoever, whatever the most drama maximizing thing or will things stabilize?

1:45:30.880 --> 1:45:35.360
 I think historians don't like to predict the future, but I can predict this one,

1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:42.160
 that it will not be a calm and stabilized election. I think as of the time that we're

1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:48.960
 talking in 2022, there are too many open questions, particularly about whether Joe Biden will run for

1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:58.640
 reelection. He says he will, but the jury I think is out on that. I can't predict whether

1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:09.120
 Donald Trump will run for election or not. I think we do know that President Trump doesn't

1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:17.200
 like to start things he can't win. And if the polling data suggests that he's not a credible

1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:25.120
 candidate, he might be reluctant to enter the race and might find more appealing the kind of

1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:30.160
 sideline kingmaker role that he's been crafting since he left the White House.

1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:38.320
 I think there are plenty of people who are dreaming that there's some sort of centrist candidate,

1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:47.520
 that whether it's a conservative Democrat or a liberal Republican who will save us from all of

1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:53.120
 this, either within the party or in a third party run, I don't think that's likely.

1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:56.640
 Why aren't we getting them? Why don't you think it's likely? What's the explanation?

1:46:56.640 --> 1:46:59.280
 This seems to be a general hunger for a person like this.

1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:06.160
 You would, but the system sorts it out, that the primary systems and the party candidate

1:47:06.160 --> 1:47:12.880
 selection systems will favor sort of more partisan views, more conservative Republicans,

1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:17.040
 more liberal Democrats as the kind of center candidates.

1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:26.960
 It seems like the system prefers mediocre executive leaders, mediocre partisan leaders.

1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:32.000
 If I take a cynical look, but maybe I'm romanticizing the leaders of the past,

1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:36.160
 and maybe I'm just remembering the great leaders of the past.

1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:40.160
 Yeah, I can assure you there's plenty of mediocre partisans in the 19th century.

1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:42.320
 Okay. And the 20th.

1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:52.720
 Well, let me ask you about platforming. Do you think Donald, it's the Twitter question,

1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:56.640
 but I was torn about whether to talk to Donald Trump on this podcast.

1:47:57.200 --> 1:47:59.200
 As a historian, what would you advise?

1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:13.440
 I think, this is a difficult question for historians who want to make sure that they

1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:19.120
 know what Americans are thinking and talking about four centuries later.

1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:25.440
 So one of the things that, at least my understanding, is that when President Trump

1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:32.640
 was banned from Twitter, his account was also deleted. And that is one of the most valuable

1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:38.400
 sources that historians will use to understand that the era and parts of it were sort of

1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:44.560
 archived and reconstructed. But in that sense, I think that that is also a real

1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:52.960
 loss to the historical record. I mean, I think that your podcast shows you'll talk to anyone.

1:48:52.960 --> 1:49:01.280
 So I'm here, right? So I'm not in the business of saying, don't talk to me.

1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:04.400
 That's one of the difficult things when I think about Hitler. I think

1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:10.960
 Hitler, Stalin, I don't know if World War I quite has the same intensity of

1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:18.640
 controversial leaders. But one of the sad things from a historian perspective is how

1:49:18.640 --> 1:49:26.880
 few interviews Hitler has given or Stalin has given. And that's such a difficult thing because

1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:33.200
 it's obvious that talking to Donald Trump, that talking to Xi Jinping, talking to Putin,

1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:40.640
 is really valuable from a historical perspective to understand. But then you think about the

1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:46.240
 momentary impact of such a conversation and you think, well, depending on how the conversation

1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:56.560
 goes, you could steer or flame, what is it, feed the flame of war or conflict or

1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:04.160
 abuses of power and things like this. And that's, I think, the tension between the journalist and

1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:11.520
 the historian. Because when journalists interview dictators, for example, one of the things that

1:50:11.520 --> 1:50:23.280
 strikes me is they're often very critical of the dictator. They're basically attacking them in

1:50:23.280 --> 1:50:28.720
 front of their face as opposed to trying to understand. Because what I perceive they're

1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:33.920
 doing is they're signaling to the other journalists that they're on the right side of history kind

1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:39.760
 of thing. But that's not very productive. And it's also why the dictators and leaders often

1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:44.160
 don't do those interviews. It's not productive to understanding who the human being is. To

1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:51.040
 understand, you have to empathize. Because few people, I think, few leaders do something

1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:56.080
 from a place of malevolence. I think they really do think they're doing good.

1:50:57.360 --> 1:51:01.520
 And not even for themselves, not even for selfish reasons, I think they're doing great for the,

1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:08.400
 they're doing the right thing for their country or for whoever the group they're leading. And to

1:51:08.400 --> 1:51:14.400
 understand that you have to, and by the way, a large percent of the country often supports them.

1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:22.160
 I bet if you legitimately poll people in North Korea, they will believe that their leader is

1:51:22.160 --> 1:51:29.520
 doing the right thing for their country. And so to understand that, you have to empathize. So that's

1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:34.480
 the tension of the journalist, I think, and the historian, because obviously the historian doesn't

1:51:34.480 --> 1:51:41.840
 care. They care, obviously, deeply. But they know that history requires deep understanding

1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:46.880
 of the human being in the full context. Yeah, it's a tough decision to make.

1:51:46.880 --> 1:51:54.000
 Yeah. Well, I think it's both for journalists and historians, the challenge is not to be too close

1:51:54.000 --> 1:52:03.680
 to your subject and not to be overly influenced and used by them. When you're talking to a living

1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:12.320
 subject, which historians do too, it's a matter of making sure that you triangulate their story

1:52:12.320 --> 1:52:19.600
 with the rest of the record. And that may paint a different picture of the person than,

1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:27.280
 and will prevent you as a journalist or a historian from just telling someone else's story.

1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:34.320
 And historians also have the benefit of going back 30, 40 years and finding all the other

1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:43.120
 stories and figuring out, playing two truths and a lie, which parts are accurate, which are not.

1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:47.760
 And journalists do that work in a day to day basis. But historians, we get a little more

1:52:47.760 --> 1:52:52.800
 time to think about what we're doing. Well, I personally also think it's deeply

1:52:52.800 --> 1:53:02.240
 disrespectful to the populace, to people to censor and ignore a person that's supported

1:53:02.240 --> 1:53:13.360
 by a very large number of people. I personally feel like you owe the citizens of this country

1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:18.560
 a deep empathy and understanding of the leaders they support,

1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:24.560
 even if you disagree with what they say. I mean, that's the, to me, I'm much more worried about

1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:31.680
 the resentment of the censorship. That it's, to having a good conversation with Donald Trump

1:53:31.680 --> 1:53:39.120
 is ultimately valuable. Because he, I think, especially in this case, I agree with you that

1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:46.160
 Donald Trump is not a singular person. He represents a set of feelings that a large number of people

1:53:46.160 --> 1:53:50.880
 have. And whatever those feelings are, you can try to figure out by talking to people,

1:53:50.880 --> 1:53:56.960
 but also talking to the man and then seeing the interplay there. What does this really

1:53:56.960 --> 1:54:04.400
 represent in this period in history, in this slice of the world? Yeah, ultimately understanding,

1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:11.520
 I think, leads to compassion and love and unity, which is how this whole thing progresses. The

1:54:11.520 --> 1:54:18.400
 tension between the different sides is useful to have a good conversation, but ultimately

1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:22.640
 coming up with the right answer and progressing towards that answer is how you make progress.

1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:29.040
 Do you think a pure democracy can work? So we have this representative of democracy

1:54:29.520 --> 1:54:35.120
 with these contentious elections and so on. When we start a civilization on Mars,

1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:40.560
 which becomes more and more realistic technologically, we can have a more direct access to be able to

1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:46.800
 vote on issues and vote for ideas. Do you think it can work? I don't think we have to go to Mars

1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:53.520
 to do it, right? I think the answer is not to flip a switch and turn on something called pure

1:54:53.520 --> 1:55:02.240
 democracy. When people are not ready for it, when they're ready for it, when they're ready to

1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:08.800
 vote, when people are not ready for it, when their incentive structures are not structured for it,

1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:15.520
 but you can experiment with more democratic forms of governance one after another, right?

1:55:15.520 --> 1:55:24.560
 Whether it's experimenting with technology to find new ways of getting greater rates

1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:32.640
 of participation in democracy, I think that we see some experiments in sort of more complicated

1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:39.440
 systems of voting that in fact might actually be more reflective of people's choices than simply

1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:44.480
 picking one candidate, right? Sort of rank choice voting or runoffs, other kinds of things.

1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:51.600
 I think that we can think more creatively about something like participatory budgeting, right?

1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:59.360
 In which we put all this money into the government and then we should, as a people,

1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:04.480
 there are more democratic ways of how we spend it. I think the most urgent in some

1:56:04.480 --> 1:56:09.600
 level is a more democratic form of foreign policymaking, right? That foreign policymaking,

1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:17.600
 decision making about the military, about foreign policy is very ways insulated from popular

1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:27.760
 participation in modern American history. Technology is not going to solve this. It's

1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:34.080
 a combination of technology and human creativity, but I think we can start heading that direction.

1:56:35.040 --> 1:56:37.520
 Whether we get there before we get to Mars, I don't know.

1:56:38.400 --> 1:56:43.920
 What interesting lessons and thoughts, if you look at the fundamentals of the history of American

1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:53.760
 elections, do you hope to reveal when you try to teach the class? How would those fundamentals be

1:56:53.760 --> 1:57:02.720
 met by the students that receive that wisdom? What do you think about this dance, especially

1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:08.480
 such an interesting idea? I hope you do go through with this kind of idea. Look at the history

1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:18.800
 while the next one is happening. Yes. I think it's worth remembering that the students who are

1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:26.080
 typical American student who's in college right now has lived their entire life after

1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:33.120
 the election of 2000 and Bush v. Gore. And after 911 probably.

1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:42.480
 And after all of these things. And so on the one hand, they take partisanship and

1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:54.640
 contentious elections for granted. They don't, I think, share some vision that things used to

1:57:54.640 --> 1:58:00.640
 be different. They don't remember a world that had lots of moderate Democrats and liberal

1:58:00.640 --> 1:58:09.600
 Republicans running around in it. But in some ways, it's a way of looking back into the past

1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:18.960
 to find other ways of organizing our politics. It's also a way of reassuring students that we

1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:26.640
 have been through contentious and even violent elections before in our history. And that people

1:58:26.640 --> 1:58:33.040
 have defended the right to vote. People have risked their lives to vote. I think they will

1:58:33.040 --> 1:58:43.200
 understand that as well. And maybe knowledge of history here can help deescalate the emotions

1:58:43.200 --> 1:58:50.560
 you might feel about one candidate or another. And from a place of calmness, you can more easily

1:58:50.560 --> 1:59:03.440
 arrive at wisdom. That's my hope. Just as a brief aside, you wrote the book Bound by War

1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:11.040
 that describes a century of war in the Pacific. So looking at this slice of geography

1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:18.320
 and power, so most crucially through the partnership between the United States and the

1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:25.040
 Philippines, can you tell some aspect of the story that is often perhaps not considered when you

1:59:25.040 --> 1:59:32.800
 start to look more at the geopolitics of Europe and Soviet Union and the United States? How did

1:59:32.800 --> 1:59:42.160
 the war in the Pacific define the 20th century? Yeah, I came to this book Bound by War from a sense

1:59:42.160 --> 1:59:50.960
 that our stories were too lopsided toward Europe. That American history, when viewed from the Pacific,

1:59:51.680 --> 1:59:59.680
 specifically in the 20th century, helps us understand American power in some new ways. Not

1:59:59.680 --> 2:00:07.520
 only American projection of power into Asia, but also the ways in which American power affected

2:00:07.520 --> 2:00:15.680
 people in Asia, either in places like the Philippines where the United States had a colony

2:00:15.680 --> 2:00:20.800
 for almost 50 years, or Asian Americans, people who had migrated over their descendants in the

2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:26.960
 United States. And those linkages between the United States and Asia, particularly the US

2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:31.600
 Philippine connection, I think were something that needed to be traced across the 20th century,

2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:38.400
 because it's a way, a new way of seeing American power from a different angle. You see it in that

2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:44.800
 way. What are some aspects that define America from when you take the perspective of the Pacific?

2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:55.760
 What military conflict and the asymmetry of power there? I start in 1898 with the US invasion of

2:00:55.760 --> 2:01:03.120
 the Philippines. It's a conquest and annexation. And I think in many ways this is a defining conflict

2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:08.640
 of the 20th century that's often completely overlooked. We're described, I think incorrectly,

2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:15.920
 as merely a war with Spain, that the war in the Philippines is our first extended overseas conflict,

2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:21.520
 our first conflict in what would come to be called the developing world or third world.

2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:28.080
 It's a form of counterinsurgency. This is the US Army learning lessons that are then

2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:33.360
 repeated again in the Second World War in Korea, Vietnam, and even after 911.

2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:36.400
 Is the Philippines our friends or enemies in this history?

2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:43.040
 Well, that's the interesting part. The book focuses in particular on Filipinos who fight

2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:48.640
 with the Americans who fought in the US Army and Navy over the course of the 20th century.

2:01:48.640 --> 2:01:53.920
 And they are in a fundamentally ironic position. They are from the Philippines and they're fighting

2:01:53.920 --> 2:02:01.920
 for the United States, which is the colonial power occupying their country. And I think that irony

2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:08.400
 persists. So if you look at polling data where they ask people all around the world, do you

2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:15.200
 think positively or negatively about the United States? That the highest responses are from the

2:02:15.200 --> 2:02:20.880
 Philippines. Filipinos view the United States more favorably than people from any other country in

2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:27.040
 the world, including America. They think more favorably of Americans than Americans do.

2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:32.320
 And so sort of unpacking that irony is part of what I'm trying to get at in the book.

2:02:32.320 --> 2:02:37.600
 What was the people power revolution and what lessons can we learn from it? You kind of assign

2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:46.720
 an important, a large value to it in terms of what we can learn for the American project.

2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:54.560
 Yeah. So in 1986, the president of the Philippines, Bernard Marcos, is overthrown by a popular

2:02:54.560 --> 2:03:01.120
 revolution known as people power in the wake of a contested and probably almost certainly rigged

2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:11.600
 election that sort of confirms his rule. When that is overturned through sort of mass movements

2:03:11.600 --> 2:03:18.960
 in the Philippines, it's also sort of confirmed in many ways by the reluctance of the United States

2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:24.800
 to intervene to prop up a Cold War ally. Bernard Marcos had supported American policy throughout

2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:30.880
 his administration. The Reagan administration, Ronald Reagan's president at the time, basically chooses

2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:38.320
 not to support him. That's a personally wrenching decision for Reagan himself. But he's being

2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:45.120
 shaped in many ways by the emerging voices of neoconservative political foreign policy voices,

2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:50.640
 in particular, Paul Wolfowitz and the State Department and others who see sort of movements

2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:56.560
 for democracy and democratization that then kind of take fire in the late 20th century in Latin

2:03:56.560 --> 2:04:03.840
 America, in South Korea, in Eastern Europe, and all around the world until it hits the

2:04:03.840 --> 2:04:14.080
 wall in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. What's that wall? What do you mean by it hits the wall?

2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:23.680
 So there are global movements for democratization, for opening up throughout the world, starting

2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:29.200
 in the 1980s. And obviously, they continue in Eastern Europe with the fall of the Berlin Wall

2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:39.360
 in 1989. I say it hits the wall in China with the protests in Tiananmen Square that are blocked

2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:46.000
 and that are crushed and I think represent a real sort of turning point in the history of

2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:49.840
 democratic institutions on a global scale in the late 20th century.

2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:56.000
 So there's some places where the fight for freedom will work and some places not.

2:04:56.720 --> 2:05:03.920
 And that's the kind of lesson from the 20th to take forward to the 21st century.

2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:11.200
 No, I think the lesson is maybe one that we talked about earlier, that there's this dynamic

2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:18.320
 dance between leaders, whether totalitarian leaders or leaders of democratic movements

2:05:18.320 --> 2:05:24.400
 and the people that they're leading. And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

2:05:24.400 --> 2:05:29.200
 Let me ask a big ridiculous question because we talked about sort of presidential elections.

2:05:30.240 --> 2:05:34.560
 Now, this is objectively, definitively, you have to answer one person who's the greatest

2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:38.880
 president in American history. Oh, that's easy. Yeah. Abraham Lincoln.

2:05:38.880 --> 2:05:48.800
 Is that easy, not George Washington? Washington had the statesman qualities he

2:05:48.800 --> 2:05:54.560
 understood his power as the first president. Also a relinquished power.

2:05:54.560 --> 2:06:04.080
 He was willing to relinquish power. But Lincoln has the combination of personal leadership,

2:06:04.080 --> 2:06:14.240
 a fundamental moral character, and just the ability to fight the fight of politics,

2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:19.040
 to play the game of it, to get where he's going, to play the short game and the long game,

2:06:20.080 --> 2:06:30.000
 to work with his enemies, to block them when he had to. And he gets the United States through

2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:33.520
 the Civil War. So you've got to give them some credit for that. And it's pretty good at making

2:06:33.520 --> 2:06:40.960
 speeches. Obviously, it helps that he's a remarkable speaker and able to convey those

2:06:40.960 --> 2:06:48.080
 kinds of visions. But he is first and foremost a politician and probably the best one we have.

2:06:48.800 --> 2:06:55.600
 Both getting elected and at ruling. In some ways, better at the doing than at the getting

2:06:55.600 --> 2:07:05.840
 elected. The election of 1860 is just a hot mess that could have worked out many different ways.

2:07:06.400 --> 2:07:12.160
 And even the election of 1864, when we have a presidential election in the middle of a civil

2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:21.280
 war, it was not a foregone conclusion that Lincoln would be reelected. So both times he's not a

2:07:21.280 --> 2:07:27.600
 master campaigner by any means, but he was a master politician as a governor.

2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:35.760
 Do we have leaders like that today? So one perspective is like leaders aren't

2:07:36.320 --> 2:07:41.200
 ain't what they used to be. And another perspective is, well, we always romanticize stuff that

2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:45.360
 happens in the past. We forget the flaws and remember the great moments.

2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:55.200
 Yeah, both of those things are true. On the one hand, we are not surrounded by people of

2:07:55.200 --> 2:08:02.640
 Lincoln's caliber right now. That feels like the case. And I think we can say that with some

2:08:02.640 --> 2:08:13.840
 certainty. But I always like to point to President Harry Truman, who left office with some truly abysmal

2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:23.600
 presidential ratings, was dismissed throughout his presidency as unqualified, as not knowing what

2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:30.720
 he was doing, etc. And then turns out, with hindsight, we know that he was better at the job

2:08:30.720 --> 2:08:36.000
 than anyone understood. Better at getting elected. You remember that sign, do we defeat Truman?

2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:42.960
 He showed them. And better at holding power and better at sort of kind of building the kind

2:08:42.960 --> 2:08:50.160
 of institutions that long after he was gone, demonstrated that he won the long game.

2:08:50.960 --> 2:08:58.880
 And some of that is the victors do write the story. And I ask myself very much,

2:08:58.880 --> 2:09:06.000
 how will history remember Volodymyr Zelensky? It's not obvious. And how will history remember

2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:16.320
 Putin? That too is not obvious. Because it depends on how the role, the geopolitics,

2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:23.280
 the how the nations, how the history of these nations unravel, unfold rather. So

2:09:24.080 --> 2:09:31.040
 it's very interesting to think about. And the same is true for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Obama,

2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:42.000
 George Bush, Bill Clinton, and so on. I think it's probably an unanswerable question of which

2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:47.120
 of the presidents will be remembered as a great president from this time. You can make all kinds

2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:52.240
 of cases for all kinds of people and they do, but it's unclear. It's fascinating to think about

2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:57.840
 when the robots finally take over what which of the humans they will appreciate the most.

2:09:57.840 --> 2:10:09.040
 Let me ask for advice. Do you have advice for young folks as they, because you mentioned the

2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:14.480
 folks you're teaching, they don't even, they don't know what it's like to have waited on the internet

2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:20.000
 for the thing to load up for every single web page is suffering. They don't know what it's

2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:27.280
 like to not have the internet and have a dial phone that goes and then the joy of getting

2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:32.640
 angry at somebody and hanging up with a physical phone. They don't know any of that. So for those

2:10:32.640 --> 2:10:37.760
 young folks that look at the contentious elections, they look at our contentious world,

2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:44.000
 our divided world, what advice would you give them of how to have a career they can be proud of?

2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:48.640
 Let's say they're in college or in high school and how to have a life they can be proud of.

2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:55.920
 Oh man, that's a big question. Yeah, I've never given a graduation speech.

2:10:55.920 --> 2:11:00.480
 This is like warm up. Let's look for like raw materials before you write it.

2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:11.440
 If I did, I think I would advise students that history teaches that you should be

2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:19.280
 more optimistic than your current surroundings suggest, right? And I think it would be very

2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:25.440
 easy as a young person today to think there's nothing I can do about this politics. There's

2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:30.720
 nothing I can say to this person on the other side of the aisle. There's nothing I can do about

2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:39.760
 the planet, et cetera, and just sort of give up. And I think history teaches that

2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:47.680
 we don't know who the winners and losers are in the long run, but we know that the people who

2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:53.040
 give up are always the losers, right? So don't give into cynicism or apathy.

2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:55.600
 Yeah. Optimism paves the way.

2:11:56.320 --> 2:12:03.120
 Yeah, because human beings are deeply resilient and creative, even under far more difficult

2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:11.360
 circumstances than we face right now. Let me ask a question that you wouldn't even dare cover in

2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:18.080
 your graduation commencement speech. What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?

2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:24.720
 This whole project that history studies and analyzes as if there's a point to the whole

2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:34.000
 thing. What is the point? All the wars, all the presidents, all the struggles to discover what

2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:40.880
 it means to be human or reach for a higher ideal. Why? Why do you think we're here?

2:12:40.880 --> 2:12:52.000
 Yeah. I think this is where there is often a handoff from the historian to the clergy.

2:12:55.360 --> 2:13:01.840
 But in the end, there's less distance between the two than you think,

2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:09.360
 that if you think about some of the kind of answers to that question, what is the meaning

2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:17.520
 of life that are given from religious traditions? Often they have a fundamentally historical

2:13:17.520 --> 2:13:26.800
 core. It's about unifying the past and the present in some other non earthly dimension.

2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:35.520
 So I think there is that. I think even for people who don't have religious belief,

2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:45.360
 there's a way in which history is about the shared human condition. And I think historians aspire

2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:55.600
 to telling all of that story. We drill down on the miseries of war and depressions and so forth,

2:13:55.600 --> 2:14:03.920
 but the story is not complete without blueberries and butterflies and all the rest

2:14:03.920 --> 2:14:10.960
 that go with it. So both the humbling and the inspiring

2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:18.080
 aspect that you get by looking back at human history that we're in this together.

2:14:20.400 --> 2:14:24.560
 Christopher, this is a huge honor and it's an amazing conversation. Thank you for taking us

2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:31.600
 back to a war that not often discussed, but in many ways defined the 20th century and the

2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:36.960
 century we are in today, which is the first world war, the war that was supposed to end

2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:43.520
 all wars, but instead defined the future wars and defines our struggle to try to avoid world war

2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:49.200
 three. So it's a huge honor to talk with me today. This is amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you.

2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:54.800
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Christopher Capuzola. To support this podcast,

2:14:54.800 --> 2:14:59.920
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you some words from Woodrow

2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:09.040
 Wilson in 1917 about world war one that haunted the rest of the 20th century. This is a war to

2:15:09.040 --> 2:15:17.680
 end all wars. George Santana, a Spanish American philosopher, responded to this quote in 1922 by

2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:30.800
 saying, only the dead have seen the end of war. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
