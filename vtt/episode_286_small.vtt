00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
 If you could talk to Vladimir Putin once again, now, what kind of things would you talk about here?

00:08.320 --> 00:09.920
 What kind of questions would you ask?

00:12.560 --> 00:17.520
 The following is a conversation with Oliver Stone. He's one of the greatest filmmakers of all time

00:17.520 --> 00:23.920
 with three Oscar wins and 11 Oscar nominations. His films tell stories of war and power.

00:23.920 --> 00:29.920
 Fearlessly and often controversially, shining a light on the dark parts of American and global

00:29.920 --> 00:38.080
 history. His films include Platoon, Wall Street, Born on the Fourth of July, Scarface, JFK, Nixon,

00:38.080 --> 00:44.960
 Alexander, W, Snowden, and documentaries where he has interviewed some of the most powerful

00:44.960 --> 00:51.680
 and consequential people in the world including Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, and Vladimir Putin.

00:51.680 --> 00:58.240
 And in this conversation, Oliver and I mostly focus our discussion on Vladimir Putin, Russia,

00:58.240 --> 01:03.200
 and the war in Ukraine. My goal with these conversations is to understand the human

01:03.200 --> 01:09.280
 being before me, to understand not just what they think, but how they think, to steelman their

01:09.280 --> 01:15.440
 ideas, and to steelman the devil's advocate, all in service of understanding, not the origin.

01:16.480 --> 01:20.320
 I have done this poorly in the past. I'm still struggling with this,

01:20.320 --> 01:27.040
 but I'm working hard to do better. I believe the moment we draw lines between good people

01:27.040 --> 01:33.840
 and evil people will lose our ability to see that we're all one people in the most fundamental of

01:33.840 --> 01:40.800
 ways, and lose track of the deep truth expressed by the old Solzhenitsyn line that I've returned

01:40.800 --> 01:46.880
 to time and time again, that the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man.

01:46.880 --> 01:54.560
 Oliver Stone has a perspective that he extensively documents in his powerful controversial series

01:54.560 --> 02:01.680
 The Untold History of the United States, that imperialism and the military industrial complex

02:01.680 --> 02:07.040
 paved the path to absolute power, and thus corrupt the minds of the leaders and institutions that

02:07.040 --> 02:13.680
 wield it. From this perspective, the way out of the humanitarian crisis and human suffering in

02:13.680 --> 02:19.280
 Ukraine, and the way out from the pull of the beating drums of nuclear war is not simple to

02:19.280 --> 02:26.560
 understand, but we must, because all of humanity hangs in the balance. I will talk to many people

02:26.560 --> 02:31.520
 who seek to understand the way out of this growing catastrophe, including to historians,

02:31.520 --> 02:36.640
 to leaders, and perhaps most importantly, to people on the ground in Ukraine and Russia.

02:36.640 --> 02:42.960
 Not just about war and suffering, but about life, friendship, family, love, and hope.

02:44.560 --> 02:49.920
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:49.920 --> 02:57.680
 And now, dear friends, here's Oliver Stone. You're working on a documentary now about nuclear

02:57.680 --> 03:03.680
 energy. Yes. So it's interesting to talk about this. Energy is such a big part of the world,

03:03.680 --> 03:09.200
 about the geopolitics of the world, about the way the world is. What do you think is the role of

03:09.200 --> 03:12.960
 nuclear energy in the 21st century? Good question. And first of all, obviously,

03:12.960 --> 03:17.840
 everyone's talking about climate change, right? So here I wake up to that a few years ago, and

03:18.720 --> 03:27.600
 clearly we're concerned. I picked up a book by Josh Goldstein and his coauthor who's Swedish.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.280
 Those two wrote a book called Bright Future. A Bright Future came out a few years ago,

03:31.280 --> 03:40.560
 and I lapped it up. It was a book, fact based, clear, not too long and not too technical,

03:40.560 --> 03:48.320
 and it was very clear that they were in favor of all kinds of renewables, renewable energy, yes.

03:49.360 --> 03:58.000
 They hated, made it very clear how dangerous oil and gas were, methane, and made it very

03:58.000 --> 04:03.840
 clear to the layman like me, and at the same time said that these renewables can work so far.

04:04.400 --> 04:12.000
 But the gap is enormous as to how much electricity the world is going to need in 2050 and beyond.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.120
 Two, three, four times, we don't even know the damage, but we have India, we have China,

04:17.120 --> 04:22.800
 we have Africa, we have Asia coming on to the scene wanting more and more electricity.

04:22.800 --> 04:28.000
 So they address the problem as a global one, not just as often in the United States. You get the

04:28.000 --> 04:34.080
 ethnocentric United States point of view that we know we're doing well, blah, blah, blah.

04:34.080 --> 04:39.520
 We're not doing well, but we sell that to people that were comfortable. We spend more energy than

04:39.520 --> 04:47.840
 anybody in this country per capita than anybody, and at the same time, we don't seem to understand

04:47.840 --> 04:51.680
 the global picture. So that's what they did, and they made me very aware. So the only way to close

04:51.680 --> 04:57.280
 that gap, the only way in their mind is nuclear energy, and talking about a gap of building

04:57.840 --> 05:06.720
 a huge amount of reactors over the next 30 years, and starting now, they make that point over and

05:06.720 --> 05:13.200
 over again. So obviously, this country in the United States is not going to go in that direction,

05:13.200 --> 05:20.480
 because it just is incapable of having that kind of will, political will, and fear is a huge factor,

05:20.480 --> 05:30.240
 and still a lot of shibbles, a lot of myths about nuclear energy have confused and confounded the

05:30.240 --> 05:36.000
 landscape. The environmentalists have played a huge role in doing good things, many good things,

05:36.000 --> 05:41.600
 but also confusing and confounding the landscape and making accusations against nuclear energy that

05:41.600 --> 05:49.440
 were exaggerated. So taking all these things into consideration, we set about making this

05:49.440 --> 05:55.200
 documentary, which is about finished now, almost finishing. It's an hour and 40 minutes, and that

05:55.200 --> 06:00.080
 was a hard part, getting it down from about three and a half hours to about this something more

06:00.080 --> 06:05.760
 manageable. And is it interviews? It's interviews, among others, but essentially we went to Russia,

06:05.760 --> 06:11.200
 we went to France, which is the most perhaps advanced nuclear country in the world, Russia,

06:11.200 --> 06:19.680
 and the United States. We went to the Idaho laboratory and talked to the scientists there,

06:19.680 --> 06:24.240
 as well as the Department of Energy people that are handling this. Idaho is one of the

06:24.240 --> 06:27.440
 experimental labs in the United States. It's probably one of the most advanced, and they're

06:27.440 --> 06:35.520
 doing a lot of advanced nuclear there. We also, we studied, well, Russia gave us a lot of insight.

06:35.520 --> 06:41.360
 We're very cooperative because they have some of the most advanced nuclear, actually the

06:41.360 --> 06:45.520
 probably the most advanced nuclear reactor in the world at Bellayarsk at the Ural Mountains.

06:46.320 --> 06:53.440
 So we did an investigation there. And in France, they have some very advanced

06:54.480 --> 06:59.280
 nuclear reactors in their building. Now they're building again. They had a little,

06:59.280 --> 07:04.480
 the Green Party came into power, just not into power, but became a factor in France,

07:04.480 --> 07:08.800
 and there was a motion. When Hollande was president, they started to move away from it.

07:08.800 --> 07:16.400
 Actually, they were beginning to just abandon, they let not complete their, in other words,

07:16.400 --> 07:21.600
 let close down some of the nuclear reactors. There was talk of that, but thank God, France did not

07:21.600 --> 07:27.680
 do that. And Mac home came in and recently reversed it, reversed it and their building as

07:27.680 --> 07:33.760
 fast as they can now, especially with the Ukraine war going on. There's an awareness that

07:33.760 --> 07:38.800
 that Russia will not be providing, may not be providing the energy Europe needs.

07:39.760 --> 07:44.720
 So, and then China is the other one too. That's the other factor. I'm talking about the big boys.

07:45.520 --> 07:50.880
 They have doing tremendous work and fast, which is very hopeful. But of course,

07:50.880 --> 07:57.280
 China is building in all directions at once. The coal continues to be huge in China and

07:57.280 --> 08:06.720
 methane too. But basically coal, coal in India, in China, the biggest users of coal.

08:08.720 --> 08:14.080
 And we know, as you know, Germany went back to coal a few years ago. So all these factors,

08:14.080 --> 08:19.760
 it's fascinating picture globally. So we try to achieve a consensus that where nuclear can work,

08:20.720 --> 08:26.160
 and where it will be working, it will be used more and more. The question is how much carbon

08:26.160 --> 08:33.040
 dioxide China and Russia will be putting out. France is the only one that's not putting it out.

08:33.040 --> 08:38.720
 The United States has not changed with all the talk and all the nonsense about renewables and

08:39.520 --> 08:44.560
 the new lifestyle and all this. It's great for your guilt complex, but it doesn't do anything

08:44.560 --> 08:48.560
 for the total accumulation of carbon dioxide in the world.

08:48.560 --> 08:52.480
 Who's going to lead the way on nuclear, do you think? You mentioned Russia, France,

08:52.480 --> 08:57.360
 China, United States. Who's going to lead? I don't think it's going to be a United Nations

08:57.360 --> 09:02.080
 kind of thing, because the world doesn't seem capable of uniting. We go to these conferences,

09:03.040 --> 09:09.280
 Kyoto, and we talk and we agree, but then we don't actually enforce. I don't think it can happen

09:09.280 --> 09:14.160
 that way. I think it's going to be an individual race with countries that are going to just do

09:14.160 --> 09:20.640
 it for their own self interest, like China is doing it. China, the thing is, if it works,

09:20.640 --> 09:26.000
 and I'm praying that it will really work on a big scale, China will back away from coal naturally.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.120
 The same thing will be true of India. They will see the benefits, because if you go to India,

09:31.120 --> 09:34.960
 you see the cities, the pollution. You walk around and that stuff, and you get,

09:36.480 --> 09:41.600
 there's no hope in this, and you sense it. People will move in this direction naturally,

09:41.600 --> 09:49.920
 because nuclear is clean energy. The amount of casualties of nuclear is the lowest on the industrial

09:49.920 --> 09:55.840
 scale for energy producing from coal down to oil, everything. The lowest casualty rate,

09:56.960 --> 10:04.000
 very lowest, 0.002 or something, is nuclear. Not that many people have died from nuclear,

10:04.000 --> 10:10.800
 not that many. I think 50 people at Chernobyl, which was the worst accident. Nobody died at

10:10.800 --> 10:16.240
 Fukushima. Nobody died at Three Mile Island, and that's what you hear all over and over again,

10:16.240 --> 10:23.200
 these accidents. The environmentalists have sold us the idea that they're dangerous,

10:24.800 --> 10:29.520
 and it's a lot of environmentalists, thank God, of changing it. They've come off that routine,

10:29.520 --> 10:35.360
 and they've said, we were wrong. We've done a lot of good work. Greenpeace did a lot of good work.

10:35.360 --> 10:42.480
 Whale, saving this, saving that, but they admit themselves. Not they don't, but people who have

10:42.480 --> 10:52.320
 been in the organization have said, we were wrong. In 1956, we show the articles in the

10:52.320 --> 10:59.040
 New York Times that came out. The Rockefeller Foundation, which, of course, is a big producer

10:59.040 --> 11:09.840
 of oil, the Rockefeller family, and the foundation came out with a study, which was weighted.

11:09.840 --> 11:16.800
 They tipped the scale, put a thumb on the scale, but it was a scientific expose of radiation

11:17.600 --> 11:23.040
 in the study that came out in the printed in the New York Times, because the New York Times

11:23.040 --> 11:29.040
 publisher, Salzburger, was on their board. He was one of the board members, so they got a lot of

11:30.640 --> 11:38.240
 strong publicity condemning radiation from which killed, started the process of doubting nuclear

11:38.240 --> 11:43.760
 energy. The radiation levels that they pointed out were very minor, and, of course, if you go

11:43.760 --> 11:50.320
 into a scientific analysis of this now with what we know, it's just not true, but it tilted the

11:50.320 --> 11:55.760
 scale back in the 50s, 60s, and started the questioning the nuclear business.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.800
 Do you think that was malevolence or incompetence?

11:58.800 --> 12:03.920
 No, I think it was competition. I don't think it was conspiracy as much as it was a sense.

12:03.920 --> 12:09.600
 We don't want this nuclear energy is going to end the dominance of oil. Absolutely,

12:09.600 --> 12:14.320
 and it will, and it will anyway, because it's the only sane way for the world to proceed,

12:14.320 --> 12:22.560
 but the world will have to learn through adversity. In other words, this situation could get worse,

12:23.360 --> 12:28.080
 much worse, and certain countries are just going to have to adapt like we always do.

12:28.080 --> 12:32.080
 When things become too hard, you've got to change your thinking,

12:32.080 --> 12:34.640
 and humans are pretty good at that.

12:34.640 --> 12:40.000
 Yes. Talking about human nature, they're very adept at that. Germany, for example,

12:40.000 --> 12:44.960
 I mean, when the Fukushima happened, they went out of the nuclear business. That was shocking to

12:44.960 --> 12:51.600
 me. They just pulled out, and they destroyed several of their nuclear reactors that were

12:51.600 --> 13:03.520
 still functioning and put up coal and oil replaced it. As a result, Germany drifted into this place

13:03.520 --> 13:10.480
 next to France. Their electricity bills went up, and France stayed the same. They have a

13:10.480 --> 13:14.720
 different system in Europe, but more or less, no question that France was doing a lot better than

13:14.720 --> 13:23.040
 Germany. Now, with this Ukraine issue, it's a very interesting fulcrum point, whether Germany is

13:23.040 --> 13:29.760
 going, what direction they're going to go now? How can they keep going with coal? They just can't.

13:31.040 --> 13:39.760
 What's the connection between oil, coal, nuclear, and war? Energy and conflict.

13:39.760 --> 13:46.560
 When you look at the 21st century, when you were doing this documentary, were you thinking of nuclear

13:46.560 --> 13:52.160
 as a way to power the world, but is it also to avoid conflict over resources?

13:53.520 --> 13:58.320
 Is there some aspect to energy being a source of conflict that we are trying to avoid?

13:58.320 --> 14:11.840
 I don't have the history of energy at my fingertips, and it's a very long history here,

14:11.840 --> 14:19.040
 but I would say, apparently not. It does seem that individually each country can answer its needs

14:19.040 --> 14:27.600
 by building, and up until now, we haven't had conflict accepted in this issue of Russia supplying

14:27.600 --> 14:36.720
 Europe. Obviously, the pipeline Nord Stream 2 has been closed, and Nord Stream 1 is also

14:36.720 --> 14:44.240
 probably going to be phased out, and the concept of Russia supplying gas to Europe

14:44.240 --> 14:50.720
 is now up and near, and who knows what's going to happen? I just don't see how Europe can get away

14:50.720 --> 14:56.640
 from using Russian gas. But Russian gas is not the solution, because it's methane too,

14:56.640 --> 15:03.600
 and it goes up into the atmosphere. Methane in a short term is worse than coal, worse.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.560
 There's all kinds of charts we show in the film. We try not to be too overfactual,

15:08.560 --> 15:13.920
 but methane is not the answer. It's a short term answer.

15:18.480 --> 15:23.280
 Will countries go to war over energy is a question that I'm trying to think of all

15:23.280 --> 15:28.080
 the wars that happened. You could say Germany, of course, during World War II,

15:28.080 --> 15:34.160
 needed oil very badly, and it dictated their strategy with Romania, etc., and

15:34.160 --> 15:41.040
 it's getting the oil fields open. I haven't thought that one through. I'd have to make

15:41.040 --> 15:47.440
 a documentary on it to really understand how energy and war interface.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.640
 It's always part of the calculation, but it's a question of how much.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.920
 That's the question. I just have to ask, because you mentioned your mom was from France.

15:56.560 --> 16:01.440
 You've traveled, for this documentary, and you traveled in general throughout the world,

16:01.440 --> 16:08.480
 in Russia, Ukraine. What are the defining characteristics of these cultures? Let's go

16:08.480 --> 16:16.160
 with Russia. As I told you, I'm half Ukrainian, half Russian. I came from that part of the world.

16:16.160 --> 16:21.520
 What are some interesting, beautiful aspects of the culture of Russia and Ukraine?

16:21.520 --> 16:28.080
 I can't really speak honestly of Ukraine. I was there only in 1983 when I visited the

16:28.080 --> 16:34.720
 Soviet Union under the communism, and Kiev was beautiful and was one of the nicer places I went,

16:34.720 --> 16:42.160
 but they were very much stultified by the communist system. They all were. The best places to visit

16:42.160 --> 16:49.920
 in Russia were always in the south, whether Georgia or the Muslim countries. It was always a better

16:49.920 --> 16:54.960
 culture in terms of comfort, but communism was rough, and that was the end of it,

16:54.960 --> 17:00.880
 pretty much Brezhnev regime. And then Andropov Gorbachev was three years in the future when I

17:00.880 --> 17:07.360
 was there. So I can't talk about Ukraine, and they've not been friendly to me since. Of course,

17:07.360 --> 17:13.680
 since I made the Putin interviews, Ukraine has banned me, I believe. They've been very tough

17:13.680 --> 17:20.880
 on people who are critical. I think the Russian people have been very special to me, perhaps

17:20.880 --> 17:25.120
 because of my European upbringing, but I enjoy talking to them. I find them very open, very

17:25.120 --> 17:32.080
 generous, and they appreciate support. They appreciate people who say, you know, I understand

17:32.080 --> 17:38.000
 why your government is doing this or this or this. I've tried to stay open minded and listen to both

17:38.000 --> 17:44.880
 sides. The thing that I have seen as an American is, of course, this American enmity towards Russia

17:44.880 --> 17:53.120
 from the very beginning. I grew up in 1940, 46, I was born in the 50s. It was so anti Russian.

17:53.680 --> 17:57.280
 They were everywhere. They were in our schools. They were in our State Department. They were

17:59.040 --> 18:03.360
 spying on us. They were stealing the country from us. That was the way the American

18:04.640 --> 18:09.440
 right wing, not even the right wing, I'd say the Republican party, pictured the Russians. They were

18:09.440 --> 18:14.880
 actively engaged in infiltrating America and changing our thinking.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.880
 Television shows were based on this. It was very much the Jay Edgar Hoover mentality,

18:20.880 --> 18:27.440
 that communism was even behind the student protests of the 1960s. This was the direction in

18:27.440 --> 18:35.040
 which the FBI and the CIA were thinking. I grew up with a prejudice and it took me many years.

18:35.040 --> 18:40.640
 My father was a Republican and he was a stockbroker and he was a very intelligent man. But even he,

18:41.200 --> 18:46.720
 because he was a World War II soldier, he was a colonel, had fallen under the influence.

18:46.720 --> 18:52.800
 It had, in order to be successful in American business in the 1950s, you had to have a very

18:52.800 --> 19:00.560
 strong anti Soviet line. Very strong. You wouldn't get ahead if you expressed any kind of, let's

19:00.560 --> 19:06.400
 end this Cold War, any kind of activity of that nature. You'd be cast aside as a Pinko or somebody

19:06.400 --> 19:13.280
 who was not completely on the board with the American way of doing business, which was capitalism

19:13.280 --> 19:21.200
 works, communism doesn't. And in particular, communism is embodied by the Soviet Union

19:21.200 --> 19:30.080
 is the enemy. So hence the narrative behind the Cold War.

19:30.720 --> 19:36.560
 That's correct. And it basically lasted. I mean, you saw the ups and downs of it.

19:37.360 --> 19:43.360
 When Reagan came in, I was, well, first of all, we had the crisis of 1962 with the Cuban Missile

19:43.360 --> 19:49.200
 Crisis. And Kennedy proved himself to be a warrior for peace. He resolved that with Khrushchev.

19:49.200 --> 19:53.680
 That was a big moment, huge moment. And people don't give him credit enough for

19:54.560 --> 19:58.880
 really saving us from a war that could have, could have affected all of mankind.

19:59.440 --> 20:04.560
 But it still didn't avert. No, because the moment he was killed,

20:05.760 --> 20:09.440
 honestly, there was a lot of, we can talk about that. And as you know, I've made a film,

20:10.080 --> 20:17.920
 JFK revisited as a documentary released this year about the movie I made in 1991.

20:17.920 --> 20:24.080
 But the moment he was killed, I would argue that Lyndon Johnson went back immediately to the old

20:24.080 --> 20:31.040
 way of thinking the old way of doing business, which was the Eisenhower Truman Way, which we

20:31.040 --> 20:35.760
 had adapted since World War II. That was an interim. You have to think about it from Roosevelt

20:35.760 --> 20:45.680
 dies in 45. Roosevelt has an interim of 15 years where he has more of a democratic regime,

20:45.680 --> 20:50.240
 more liberal. He establishes, he recognizes the Soviet Union for the first time

20:50.880 --> 20:56.000
 since the revolution. And he actually has a relationship with them. He sends ambassadors

20:56.000 --> 21:03.040
 who are friendly and he wants, he has a relationship with Stalin, etc. And Yalta,

21:04.160 --> 21:07.040
 and, or not Tehran, rather, that's where he had the relationship.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.720
 Do you think if JFK lived, we would not have a cold war?

21:10.720 --> 21:17.360
 No, absolutely not. And we go into great depth on that in the film. I urge you to see it because

21:17.360 --> 21:21.760
 it goes into all the issues around the world. Kennedy was being very much an anti imperialist,

21:21.760 --> 21:27.440
 it turns out. And many people don't understand that. But you have to look at all his policies in

21:27.440 --> 21:34.720
 Middle East with Nasser. He had a relationship with Sukarno in Indonesia, with Latin America.

21:34.720 --> 21:40.720
 He made a big effort with the Alliance for Progress. And when Africa, above all, with Lumumba,

21:40.720 --> 21:48.240
 he was very shocked at his death and tried to defend the right, the integrity of the

21:48.240 --> 21:54.480
 Belgian Congo with Dag Hammershield of the UN. He made a big effort. Unfortunately, it didn't work

21:54.480 --> 22:00.800
 out because Dag Hammershield was killed and then Kennedy was killed. And Congo descended into the

22:00.800 --> 22:07.840
 chaos of Joseph Mabutu's dictatorship. But Kennedy was very active in terms of, as an Irishman,

22:07.840 --> 22:12.640
 not as an Englishman, he was an Irishman. And I say that because, well, we'll come back to that

22:12.640 --> 22:16.160
 because Mr. Joe Biden is an Irishman, but it's a different kind of an Irishman. They're both

22:16.160 --> 22:24.400
 Catholic Irish, but Kennedy really made an effort to change the imperialist mindset

22:24.400 --> 22:32.560
 that it still was very strong in America and Europe. Lyndon Johnson changed back to the old

22:32.560 --> 22:39.040
 policy and we were never able to really keep big time going with the Russians. Briefly had it with

22:39.040 --> 22:45.760
 Carter, but then Brzezinski came in. Brzezinski was his national security advisor. He was put

22:45.760 --> 22:51.280
 there by Rockefeller and Brzezinski was a pole. He got revenge from the Poland. Poland has always

22:51.280 --> 22:57.360
 been attacking Russia as far as I remember back to another century. I mean, the two world wars

22:57.360 --> 23:03.360
 that occupied Russia so tragically, entry points were always through Poland and Ukraine.

23:05.280 --> 23:11.680
 So Brzezinski got his revenge and Carter ended up being an enemy of the Soviet Union and

23:12.320 --> 23:17.600
 creating, as Brzezinski took pride in it, he created the atmosphere of the trap for the Soviets to

23:17.600 --> 23:27.600
 go into Afghanistan in 79. That trap was set, he says, he said in 1978. So there was never

23:27.600 --> 23:35.040
 except for brief moments of periods of detente with the Soviets. And I grew up under that.

23:35.040 --> 23:40.480
 I didn't really know anything of this going on because I was learning. I was educating myself

23:40.480 --> 23:45.920
 as I was going learning movies and trying to be a dramatist and this and that. So I wasn't

23:45.920 --> 23:51.600
 thinking about this. Then when Reagan came in, I was worried again, because it was it was a beat

23:51.600 --> 23:56.560
 of the old beat, which was there, the most evil empire. I mean, it does, it goes on in American

23:56.560 --> 24:03.920
 history. It doesn't end. Reagan got a lot of points for that. And of course, when when Gorbachev

24:03.920 --> 24:09.760
 came in, it was a beautiful moment for the world. It was a great surprise. It was probably the best

24:09.760 --> 24:15.520
 years of for America, at least from my point of view, in terms of this relaxation in the mood.

24:16.240 --> 24:24.240
 1986 to 1991 were great years in terms of ability to believe once again,

24:24.240 --> 24:30.400
 that there could be a peace dividend. But the world changed again in 1991, 92. There's an

24:30.400 --> 24:35.520
 internal mechanism. Who knows, you could blame, you can blame the United States, you could blame

24:35.520 --> 24:42.720
 Russia for it. Gorbachev was perhaps not the right man to try to administer that country. At

24:42.720 --> 24:48.800
 that point, he had great visions. He was a man of peace. But it was very difficult to hold together

24:48.800 --> 24:53.920
 such a huge empire. So vision is not enough to hold together the Soviet Union? I think

24:54.960 --> 24:59.280
 the details are interesting. I followed up on that a little bit, because I was recently in

24:59.280 --> 25:07.120
 countries like Kazakhstan, talked about the negotiations that were going on and the breakup

25:07.120 --> 25:11.760
 of the Soviet Union. It's a very interesting story, because it involves everything in Ukraine.

25:11.760 --> 25:16.880
 Of course, everything is going on now. Some, what is it, 30 million Russians were left outside of

25:16.880 --> 25:22.560
 the Soviet Union when it collapsed. They had no home anymore. They were homes in other countries,

25:22.560 --> 25:31.280
 such as in Ukraine. So it's an interesting story and with repercussions today. Kazakhstan

25:31.280 --> 25:37.200
 is a good example of keeping a balance, keeping it neutral. He played both sides,

25:37.760 --> 25:46.240
 and because Yeltsin wanted him to join the Russian Confederation in a certain way where

25:46.240 --> 25:55.520
 he'd be supporting against Gorbachev. There's a whole inward battle there. I think the Ukraine came

25:55.520 --> 26:04.240
 along with Yeltsin as well as, I'm sorry, I don't remember now, but two other regions came with him.

26:06.000 --> 26:13.760
 That was a block that broke up the Soviet Union. It was Yeltsin's plan to, and it wasn't make the

26:13.760 --> 26:19.680
 Russian Federation, and they did. I would love to return back to JFK eventually, because he's such

26:19.680 --> 26:26.080
 a fascinating figure in the history of human civilization. But let me ask you, fast forward,

26:26.080 --> 26:34.720
 in 2000, Yeltsin was no longer president, and Vladimir Putin became president. You did a series

26:34.720 --> 26:41.200
 of interviews with Vladimir Putin, as you mentioned, over a period of two years, from 2015 to 2017.

26:41.200 --> 26:49.040
 Let me ask you the high level question. What was your goal with that conversation?

26:49.040 --> 26:57.680
 Oh, it came out in 2017. I guess I started them in 2014. At that point, the Snowden

26:57.680 --> 27:05.360
 affair had happened. I was working on a movie on Snowden. That happened in 2013. Ukraine happened

27:05.360 --> 27:15.760
 in 2014. And one thing after another, by 2014, Putin was enemy number again, becoming a wanted

27:15.760 --> 27:24.000
 man on the American list. He was enemy. He was certainly in the top five. But the animosity

27:24.000 --> 27:29.760
 towards Putin had been growing since 2007 at Munich. I remember that speech when he made it.

27:29.760 --> 27:33.840
 It's in my documentary. That's a four hour documentary, four different conversations.

27:33.840 --> 27:40.000
 I mean, we talked over two years, two and a half years. But I remember that image of him at Munich

27:40.000 --> 27:47.360
 making a very important speech about world harmony, about the balance necessary in the world.

27:47.360 --> 27:54.960
 And I remember the sneer on John McCain's face. He was in Munich, obviously eyeballing

27:54.960 --> 28:01.040
 Putin and hating him. And it was so evident that McCain had no belief whatsoever that this,

28:01.040 --> 28:04.960
 he was almost treating him like this or the communists are back. And we know that Putin was

28:04.960 --> 28:11.040
 not a communist. We know that Putin is very much a market man. And he made it very clear and tried

28:11.040 --> 28:17.040
 to keep an open climate, a new relationship with Europe. But the United States, certain people in

28:17.040 --> 28:21.440
 the United States always sell that as a threat, like Putin is trying to take Europe away from us

28:21.440 --> 28:26.240
 as if we own it, as if we have the right to own it. But Putin was making the point. It's very

28:26.240 --> 28:34.160
 important about sovereignty and sovereignty for countries is crucial for this new world to have

28:34.160 --> 28:40.240
 balance. That's sovereignty for China, sovereignty for Russia, sovereignty for Iran, sovereignty for

28:41.040 --> 28:46.480
 Venezuela, sovereignty for Cuba. This is an idea that's crucial to the new world. And I think the

28:46.480 --> 28:54.080
 United States has never accepted that. Sovereignty is not an idea that they can allow. You have to be

28:54.080 --> 29:04.880
 obedient to the United States idea of so called democracy and freedom. But it's much more important

29:04.880 --> 29:10.400
 is sovereignty for these countries. And the United States has not obeyed that, has not even

29:10.400 --> 29:16.400
 acknowledged it. And it never comes up. So from the perspective of the United States, when power

29:16.400 --> 29:26.560
 centers arise in the world, you start to oppose those, not because of the ideas, but merely

29:26.560 --> 29:33.440
 because they have power. Isn't that at the heart of the doctrine of the neoconservatives? And they

29:33.440 --> 29:39.760
 packed for the new American century, they wrote that in 1997, they said there shall be no emergence

29:39.760 --> 29:46.320
 of a rival power. It was very clear was about power. And they have they've stuck to that doctrine,

29:46.320 --> 29:51.360
 which is if you if you start to get dangerous in any way or have power, we're going to knock you out.

29:52.560 --> 29:58.160
 Now that won't work. But I don't believe it can work. And that is unfortunately a policy the

29:58.160 --> 30:05.040
 United States is following. And the neoconservatives group, which is very small, but it's very strong

30:05.040 --> 30:10.560
 apparently. And their idea has resonated. It was it was behind the George Bush's invasion of

30:11.280 --> 30:18.080
 Iraq. It was part of not only Iraq, but cleaning out the whole world, draining the swamp, going to

30:18.080 --> 30:24.160
 Afghanistan first. And then although Iraq had nothing to do with Al Qaeda's attack, going after

30:24.160 --> 30:35.360
 Iraq. And of course, 60 some other countries that were terrorism had some had some signs of wherever

30:35.360 --> 30:41.120
 America judged would be a dangerous country. We had the right, you're either with us or against us.

30:41.120 --> 30:46.480
 Now that is a disastrous policy and led to one thing after another. The Iraq war never learned a

30:46.480 --> 30:52.080
 lesson. The neoconservatives were never fired, never thrown out of office. The people who

30:52.080 --> 30:58.080
 who prosecuted that war are still around. Many of them are still around. And they're they're

30:58.080 --> 31:05.680
 obviously guiding America now. Let me return to this question of power. Don't forget the sneer

31:05.680 --> 31:10.880
 that I saw there. That emblemized the United States reaction. Also, there were several other

31:10.880 --> 31:17.760
 American representatives who were laughing, kind of mocking Putin. It was very serious. I felt

31:17.760 --> 31:26.800
 it was a divide there. So since then, I mean, in a certain sense, the Europe reaction to Putin

31:26.800 --> 31:33.600
 is crucial. And they were they were more with him back then. And a big thing for America was always

31:33.600 --> 31:39.280
 to keep NATO to keep Europe in its pocket as a satellite. And with this recent war, of course,

31:39.280 --> 31:44.880
 they've succeeded in all beyond their dreams of the Russians have fulfilled the fantasy of the

31:44.880 --> 31:50.560
 United States to finally be this aggressor that they have pictured for years. Yeah, we can talk

31:50.560 --> 31:58.240
 about that later. But at that time, there was Europe had significant support for Putin. Yes.

31:58.240 --> 32:04.400
 The United States was sneering at Putin. That's correct. You can say that. And then so there's

32:04.400 --> 32:13.600
 this it was there was uncertainty as to the direction as to the future of Russia. And that's

32:13.600 --> 32:20.400
 exact. And when you interviewed Vladimir Putin, I wanted to know what they thought because we

32:20.400 --> 32:26.800
 couldn't get the the the the information war that the United States was fighting against Russia was

32:26.800 --> 32:34.240
 in evidence back then. It was full out the condemnation of Russia on all fronts. I never saw

32:34.240 --> 32:39.280
 a positive article about Putin. And although when I traveled in the world, and I traveled a lot

32:39.280 --> 32:44.160
 doing documentaries, it was very clear in the Middle East, in Africa, in other in Asia, there

32:44.160 --> 32:49.360
 was respect for him, that he was a man who was getting job his job done in the interests of Russia.

32:49.920 --> 32:56.480
 He was, as I said, in the documentary, a son of Russia, very much so. In the positive sense, a son,

32:57.120 --> 33:04.560
 a son of Russia, not that he's out there trying to destroy the interests of other of other countries.

33:04.560 --> 33:09.840
 No, that he was out there to sell that provoked the interest of Russia. But at the same time,

33:09.840 --> 33:15.920
 keep a balance, keep it, keep it, keep the world into a harmony. This has always been his picture.

33:15.920 --> 33:20.240
 Peace was always his idea. In other words, he always referred to the United States in all these

33:20.240 --> 33:26.720
 interviews as our partners. And I said, Well, you stop using that word. They're not. Well, and he

33:26.720 --> 33:33.200
 was a little bit slow in waking up to what the United States was doing. Well, that said, he's

33:33.200 --> 33:40.480
 one of the most powerful men in the world. He was at that time. And let me ask you the human question.

33:41.840 --> 33:47.920
 As the old adage goes, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts, absolutely. Did you see

33:49.600 --> 33:54.960
 any corroding effects of power on the man? Forget the political leader on just the human

33:54.960 --> 33:59.280
 being that carries that power on his shoulders for so many years.

33:59.280 --> 34:06.640
 Keep in mind that he's been unlike most modern leaders, he's been an office off and on because

34:06.640 --> 34:14.880
 there was a Medvedev was president, and he was not literally in charge. He was, he was, he was,

34:14.880 --> 34:18.720
 he took another appointment at that point, and he, but he was still very much involved.

34:18.720 --> 34:25.520
 But for 20 years, more or less, he's been at the administrator of the state, the protector of the

34:25.520 --> 34:31.920
 state. And he's apparently done a good enough job that the Russian people have kept him there.

34:31.920 --> 34:36.720
 Because contrary to what many people think, I really believe that if the Russian people didn't

34:36.720 --> 34:41.920
 want him, he would be out. I firmly believe that. I don't think you can let you can go against the

34:41.920 --> 34:46.400
 world of the people. Now it expresses itself in many ways at the ballot box and so forth,

34:46.400 --> 34:52.640
 but also in other ways in Russia, there's a strong currents of opinion. So contrary to what the

34:52.640 --> 34:58.160
 position of him as a dictator, he wouldn't last if he was unpopular. Number one,

34:58.160 --> 35:03.200
 number two, Russia is much more divided than people know. There's other factors in Russia.

35:03.200 --> 35:08.640
 He is, there's, there are always tensions in, in, around the Kremlin who has power,

35:08.640 --> 35:15.520
 who doesn't have power. That's been going on for a hundred years. But the, the factions in Russia

35:15.520 --> 35:21.120
 are very much there. So when people refer to Russia as Putin, they're, they're mistaken.

35:21.120 --> 35:26.880
 And they do this regularly in the New York papers and all this. They say, Putin did this,

35:26.880 --> 35:32.320
 Putin did that, Putin's doing that, but it's Russia that's doing it. And that's what, there's a

35:32.320 --> 35:37.600
 distinction there that I, it's changed. In the old days, I would read about Khrushchev,

35:37.600 --> 35:44.240
 but it was never Khrushchev personally. It was about the Soviet Union. There was respect for

35:44.240 --> 35:51.760
 a country. And now when it started to get personal with Putin, it, it changed and the, our thinking

35:51.760 --> 35:57.360
 changed in a, in a negative way. We, we no longer respected it as a country. We were seen as a man

35:57.360 --> 36:03.600
 and the man we had trashed repeatedly, repeatedly as a poisoner, as a murderer and none of which

36:03.600 --> 36:07.840
 has ever been proven, but which has always been repeated and repeated to the point at which it

36:07.840 --> 36:14.800
 becomes like an Orwell mantra. It becomes like he is, of course, a bad guy. Can I just ask you

36:14.800 --> 36:21.440
 as a great filmmaker, as a human being, what was it like talking to one of the most powerful men

36:21.440 --> 36:29.040
 in the world? For honestly, and I'm not naive. I've talked to a lot of powerful people in the

36:29.040 --> 36:33.200
 movie business. There are powerful people and many of them are corrupted. I've talked to many

36:33.200 --> 36:38.880
 people in my life. I've been in the military. I've seen, I've had other jobs. I have to say I

36:38.880 --> 36:45.440
 found him to be a human being. I just found him to be reasonable, calm. I never saw him lose his

36:45.440 --> 36:50.160
 temper. And I mean, you have to understand that most people in the, most people in the western

36:50.160 --> 36:57.360
 way of doing business get emotional. I don't see that. I saw him as a balanced man, as a man who

36:57.360 --> 37:03.600
 had studied this like you. There's a calmness to you that it comes from studying the world and having

37:03.600 --> 37:09.360
 a rational response to it. It's interesting. His two daughters, one of them is very scientific

37:09.360 --> 37:14.400
 and the other one's doing very well in another profession, but they're thinking, they're thinking

37:14.400 --> 37:20.800
 family. His wife too was. I can't talk for the new wife because I don't know about it, but he's,

37:20.800 --> 37:27.200
 he kept his family with great respect. He's raised his, his daughter's right. He served Yeltsin the

37:27.200 --> 37:32.720
 way he looked at it. He served Yeltsin well and he, and he still, and he never trashed Yeltsin.

37:32.720 --> 37:37.280
 Certainly a lot of people did, but you know, I asked him repeatedly, you know, was he an

37:37.280 --> 37:44.080
 alcoholic or this or that, but he wouldn't even go that far. Just respect. And this man, Yeltsin,

37:44.080 --> 37:51.920
 was, it was in many ways ridiculed, but by the Russians and he turned over the power

37:51.920 --> 37:56.000
 because he felt like he was overwhelmed. He turned over the power to this man because why,

37:56.000 --> 38:00.800
 how many people had he fired before him? Several, several prime ministers, this, that. Why did he

38:00.800 --> 38:10.000
 turn power over to Mr. Putin? Because he respected him for his work ethic and his balance, his maturity.

38:10.000 --> 38:17.200
 And that's what I can say is I saw in him a poor person, a poor, from a poor family who worked

38:17.200 --> 38:23.760
 his way up through the KGB. Well, Americans keep saying he's a KGB agent, but I, it's like saying,

38:23.760 --> 38:28.720
 you know, George Bush was a CIA agent, but you know, he became a, you grow, you grow in your life.

38:28.720 --> 38:36.400
 And he went from the KGB to this technocratic position. He dealt with many problems, including

38:36.400 --> 38:42.640
 the Chechnyan war, which is a very difficult situation, as well as the Russian submarine,

38:42.640 --> 38:47.760
 probably several things happened early in his, that balance, that gave him a lot of experience.

38:47.760 --> 38:53.440
 And he handled them all pretty well. Do you think he was an honest man? I do. Now, of course, the

38:53.440 --> 38:59.360
 question of money, the charges that he's the richest man in the world are ludicrous, certainly

38:59.360 --> 39:04.160
 doesn't live like it or act like it. If you're rich, I've, I've been around a lot of rich people

39:04.160 --> 39:08.560
 in my life. You'd probably have too. In America, you run into them. So many of them are arrogant.

39:08.560 --> 39:12.960
 I'm actually good friends now with the richest man in the world.

39:12.960 --> 39:19.200
 Oh, of course. I saw your interview with Mr. Musk, who I appreciate. At least he speaks really.

39:19.920 --> 39:27.680
 I am positive about him owning Twitter because Twitter has become censorship city has all the

39:27.680 --> 39:32.320
 major tech. I mean, the censorship that we are now seeing in the United States is so unAmerican

39:32.320 --> 39:36.800
 and shocking to me. And he is a resistance to that. That is true.

39:36.800 --> 39:41.680
 Yeah. I like, I like Musk for that, just for that only. But I also appreciate him, his

39:42.320 --> 39:48.960
 adventuresome, his nature and his desire to, to, to explore the world and to ask questions.

39:48.960 --> 39:56.080
 Yeah. There's certain ways you sound when you speak freely. There's certain ways you sound.

39:56.080 --> 40:02.400
 A man sounds when he speaks freely. Yeah. He speaks freely and it's refreshing. Yeah.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.880
 No matter whether you're rich or not, it doesn't matter. When you speak freely, it's a beautiful

40:06.880 --> 40:12.240
 thing. Actually, you must do it. A major point on going back to nuclear energy, you know, he was,

40:12.960 --> 40:17.840
 he never believed in it at first, apparently. He was going for batteries, right? And he did

40:17.840 --> 40:20.720
 put a lot of money into batteries. He made them bigger and bigger batteries, but

40:21.440 --> 40:25.280
 it just won't, as Bill Gates has said, it's just, it's not going to get us there.

40:25.280 --> 40:29.760
 Yeah. And now I think Musk is on another path. He understands the need for nuclear.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.280
 Yeah. He's a supporter of nuclear.

40:33.520 --> 40:39.120
 We're jumping around. Poon never asked for one thing, never. It was an interview. It was free

40:39.120 --> 40:46.560
 form. Ask anything you want. No, no restrictions, no rules. As with Castro, frankly. Castro did

40:46.560 --> 40:50.560
 the same thing as Dechevez. So I've had good luck in interviewing free ranging subjects,

40:50.560 --> 40:57.520
 people willing to express themselves. He's much more guarded than Castro or Dechevez because,

40:57.520 --> 41:02.160
 as you know, he's setting government policy when he speaks and anything he says is going to be

41:02.160 --> 41:07.280
 taken out of context. But there was no restrictions on what to talk about, none of that.

41:07.280 --> 41:13.200
 Nor any desire to see anything before we publish it. No need to check it with them.

41:13.200 --> 41:19.920
 It was completely... Do you think he watched the final product?

41:19.920 --> 41:24.080
 Yes, I do. But I don't think he made judgments on it. I think he was pleased.

41:25.200 --> 41:30.160
 He doesn't go either way. You see, he's pleased. I mean, he went well and he's happy for us.

41:30.800 --> 41:35.840
 But I don't think he had great enthusiasm expressed it to me. He trusted me and you

41:35.840 --> 41:41.360
 could see the way he dealt with me each time. He warmed up to me four times. You know, the first

41:41.360 --> 41:47.200
 time it might have been a little stiff. You're asking, you don't know who you're dealing with and

41:47.200 --> 41:54.000
 so forth. I understand that. But he's used to it now. He's done a lot of press. The worst press

41:54.000 --> 41:59.760
 he's done, frankly, has been the American press. And not because of his fault, but because of the

41:59.760 --> 42:04.480
 way they have treated him. If you look at the interviews, they're awful. They put... First of

42:04.480 --> 42:10.640
 all, I noticed one thing as a filmmaker right away. They use an overdub. They put a Russian speaker

42:10.640 --> 42:15.280
 for everything he says. He's much harsher. He speaks Russian in a much harsher manner than

42:15.280 --> 42:21.040
 actually Putin does. On my interview, I left him in his original language with translator.

42:21.040 --> 42:28.000
 I think that's important because he expresses himself very clearly and calmly. When you listen

42:28.000 --> 42:31.920
 to the American broadcast, it's a belligerent person who looks like he's about to bang his shoe

42:31.920 --> 42:38.240
 on the table. And secondly, the questions are highly aggressive from the beginning. There's no

42:38.240 --> 42:44.240
 there's no sense of rapport. There's no sense of, well, it's why, Mr. Putin, did you poison this

42:44.240 --> 42:49.360
 person? Why, Mr. Putin, did you kill this person? Why are you a murderer? I mean, it's blunt,

42:50.160 --> 42:57.040
 blunt negative television. Yeah, it's not just aggressive. So I obviously speak Russian. So I

42:57.040 --> 43:03.120
 get to appreciate both the original and the translation. And it's not just aggressive. It's

43:03.120 --> 43:09.440
 very shallow. They're not looking to understand. To me, aggression is okay if that's the way you

43:09.440 --> 43:16.240
 want to approach it. But it should be, there should be underlying kind of empathy for another human

43:16.240 --> 43:23.360
 being in order to be able to understand. And so some of the worst interviews I've ever listened to

43:23.360 --> 43:29.440
 is by American press of Vladimir Putin. So NBC and all those kinds of organizations,

43:29.440 --> 43:34.800
 it's very painful to watch. And you saw the reception to the Putin interviews in America was

43:34.800 --> 43:44.080
 hostile without seeing it. So many people criticized my series without having seen it. Even, even I

43:44.080 --> 43:49.600
 went on a show, a television show with this famous Colbert, you know, he's very famous in America.

43:49.600 --> 43:54.000
 And I was shocked on the show to find out that he hadn't seen anything of the four hours. He was

43:54.000 --> 44:01.360
 just attacking Putin. And he threw me. I was complicit. Therefore, I was a Putin supporter.

44:01.360 --> 44:06.800
 And the show, the show was a disaster. It's one of my worst television shows. I actually,

44:07.440 --> 44:12.640
 I had to just shut up and get off the air. I mean, at some point it was embarrassing

44:13.600 --> 44:17.200
 because the audience too was clapping for Colbert on anything he said.

44:17.200 --> 44:24.320
 Well, as an interviewer in that situation, because between you and Vladimir Putin, there was camaraderie,

44:24.320 --> 44:34.160
 there was joking, there was, are you worried? Do you put that into the calculation when you're

44:34.160 --> 44:42.880
 making a film with somebody that could be lying to you, that could be evil? You talk about Castro,

44:42.880 --> 44:50.800
 you talk about, so are you worried about how charisma of a man across the table from you can

44:51.680 --> 44:55.600
 do? No, I take that into account. I absolutely take that into account. I mean,

44:55.600 --> 45:02.160
 doing Castro, he's a wonderful speaker. He's charismatic. So is Chavez. Look at those interviews.

45:02.880 --> 45:08.720
 I took it into account. But Putin doesn't play that game. He doesn't charm you. He doesn't try to

45:08.720 --> 45:17.200
 overwhelm you with his bon amie at all. He just asks your question. I'll give you my answer straight.

45:17.200 --> 45:21.440
 Here it is. And he analyzes it. This is the history of NATO. This is the history of our

45:21.440 --> 45:26.640
 relationship with the United States. How many times have we tried to talk to them about such and

45:26.640 --> 45:33.920
 such and such and each time we get nowhere? In fact, it's a very, I would like to get along

45:33.920 --> 45:40.000
 with the United States so much. He's saying it so clearly in all his words. So to play devil's

45:40.000 --> 45:44.720
 advocate. But he's not making a big deal about it. But there is a charisma and a calmness.

45:44.720 --> 45:52.480
 Yes, there is. So like, let's just calm everything down. It's simple facts. That you can call.

45:54.480 --> 46:00.640
 So there's like the Hitler thing, which is screaming, being very loud, charismatic, strong

46:00.640 --> 46:04.880
 message and so on. And then there's a Putin style. I'm not comparing those two. There's the

46:04.880 --> 46:11.040
 Putin style communication of calmness. And that, at least to me, my personality, that can be very

46:11.040 --> 46:16.400
 captivating is bringing everything down. The facts are simple. But then when you say the facts are

46:16.400 --> 46:21.840
 simple, you can now start lying. And you don't know what's true and what's lost. It behooves you

46:21.840 --> 46:26.960
 to do some research. Yes. And frankly, when it comes to research, you're going to have a problem

46:26.960 --> 46:32.480
 because if you go to the Americanized versions of Russian history, you're going to run into a

46:32.480 --> 46:38.480
 problem. And that includes even Wikipedia. They will tell you things that are just not factually

46:38.480 --> 46:44.240
 supported. So it was a problem in terms of if you read all the books in the American

46:44.240 --> 46:50.000
 the library about Putin, there's nothing positive about it. They're awful. They're awful. And a

46:50.000 --> 46:55.360
 lot of them, I had a good relationship with Professor Stephen Cohen, who's the most, I think,

46:55.360 --> 47:00.080
 one of the most informed men on Russia. He done a lot of research, all his life. And

47:00.720 --> 47:07.840
 knew Gorbachev very well. And was very analytical about all these situations that happened before

47:07.840 --> 47:16.960
 his death in 2019. I'm not quite sure when Stephen died, but I knew him well. And he was the, he

47:16.960 --> 47:23.360
 gave me the best information I could get. I would go to Stephen and I'd say, I'm confused here.

47:23.360 --> 47:27.760
 Tell me the history of this accusation of poisoning against this person and so forth.

47:27.760 --> 47:33.360
 And he'd explain it to me in, I think, very the clearest ways that I understood. And he said to

47:33.360 --> 47:37.440
 me once, he said, most of these people who go to Russia and write this stuff about who

47:37.440 --> 47:42.160
 are going off the internet, the internet has really been a source of a lot of fractured facts here.

47:43.120 --> 47:49.600
 He said, pure analysis, you have to go back to the texts, all the documents, and to really

47:49.600 --> 47:58.960
 fully understand. But he spoke Russian. And his wife and him, Katarina Van Hoovel,

47:58.960 --> 48:06.640
 who's editor, publisher of The Nation magazine, would go to Russia several times a year and

48:06.640 --> 48:11.520
 talk to their friend Gorbachev. And Gorbachev's an interesting character. I talked to him,

48:11.520 --> 48:15.680
 interviewed him, not interviewed him, but talked to him at length. And I like him very much.

48:15.680 --> 48:21.120
 And I saw the divide, as you saw in the Putin interviews between Gorbachev and Putin early

48:21.120 --> 48:26.000
 on in the interviews, you sense Putin doesn't particularly care for Gorbachev because he,

48:26.000 --> 48:30.560
 in his point of view, he screwed up the administration of Russia and is responsible for

48:30.560 --> 48:37.600
 so much of the disaster of leaving all those people outside the Soviet Union. So these are

48:37.600 --> 48:44.960
 problems that continue into the future. But they see each other at the, or he sees,

48:44.960 --> 48:52.480
 he knows he's there at the May Day parade, we filmed. And his attitude is funny. It's very human.

48:53.680 --> 48:59.280
 He says, you know, he's welcome. He's got his pension. He's a pensioner. He's done his duty.

48:59.280 --> 49:06.880
 He's, there's no, there's no animus towards it. Even when Gorbachev in the early days,

49:06.880 --> 49:12.240
 you remember, criticized for his manners in terms of democracy. But I don't know that that,

49:12.240 --> 49:19.280
 you know, that becomes a quarrel. But frankly, by the, by the end of the situation, it's very

49:19.280 --> 49:24.400
 clear that Gorbachev is now moved closer and closer to the, says Russia is now really under

49:24.400 --> 49:30.240
 attack. This is, he sees it. He sees where the United States has made a concerted effort

49:30.240 --> 49:35.280
 to undermine Putin. And he does, and he's repeated this several times about Ukraine.

49:35.280 --> 49:41.040
 I think you've seen what he said. You can quote it. And Gorbachev is, we have no respect for

49:41.040 --> 49:47.440
 Gorbachev even, even at this juncture. When can you see Gorbachev's ideas printed in most American

49:47.440 --> 49:53.200
 newspapers? Very rarely, very rarely and not, and recently not at all. So Gorbachev, who was our

49:53.200 --> 50:00.400
 hero back in, in the American hero back in 1980s, 80s has now been condemned to the garbage can,

50:00.400 --> 50:06.080
 so to speak, of history. Well, in this complicated geopolitical picture you just outlined,

50:06.080 --> 50:16.800
 can we talk about the recent invasion of Ukraine? You wrote on Facebook a pretty eloquent analysis.

50:17.840 --> 50:28.080
 I think on March 3rd. Let me just read a small section of that just to give context. And maybe

50:28.080 --> 50:34.720
 we can talk a little bit more about both Russia and the man Putin. You wrote, although the United

50:34.720 --> 50:40.320
 States has many wars of aggression on its conscience, it doesn't justify Mr. Putin's aggression in

50:40.320 --> 50:47.760
 Ukraine. A dozen wrongs don't make a right. Russia was wrong to invade. It has made too many mistakes.

50:48.480 --> 50:54.480
 One, underestimating Ukraine resistance. Two, overestimating the military ability to achieve

50:54.480 --> 51:00.960
 its objective. Three, underestimating Europe's reaction, especially Germany, upping its military

51:00.960 --> 51:06.800
 contribution to NATO, which they've resisted for some 20 years. Even Switzerland has joined the

51:06.800 --> 51:13.760
 cause. Russia will be more isolated than ever from the West. Four, underestimating the enhanced

51:13.760 --> 51:20.320
 power of NATO, which will now put more pressure on Russia's borders. Five, probably putting Ukraine

51:20.320 --> 51:27.120
 into NATO. Six, underestimating the damage to its own economy and certainly creating more

51:27.120 --> 51:34.080
 internal resistance in Russia. Seven, creating a major readjustment of power in its oligarch class.

51:34.720 --> 51:43.760
 Eight, putting cluster and vacuum bombs into play. Nine, and underestimating the power of social

51:43.760 --> 51:52.080
 media worldwide. And you go on for a while giving a much broader picture of the history and the

51:52.080 --> 52:01.680
 geopolitics of all of this. So now, a little bit later, two months later, what are your thoughts

52:01.680 --> 52:09.120
 about the invasion of Ukraine? Well, it's very hard to be honest in this regard because the

52:10.960 --> 52:19.280
 West has brought down a curtain here and anyone who questions the invasion of Ukraine and its

52:19.280 --> 52:29.120
 consequences is an enemy of the people. It's become so difficult. I've never seen in my lifetime ever

52:29.920 --> 52:40.240
 such a wall of propaganda as I've seen in the West. And that includes France too, because I was

52:40.240 --> 52:49.440
 there recently in England. England is, of course, really vociferous. It's shocking to me how quickly

52:49.440 --> 52:54.240
 Europe moved in this direction. That includes Germany. I have German friends who express to me

52:54.240 --> 52:59.760
 their shock over Ukraine. I have Italian friends, same thing. And Italy, of course, has been perhaps

52:59.760 --> 53:06.960
 the most understanding and compassionate of countries. So it's quite evident that there's

53:06.960 --> 53:13.040
 a united, and this attests to the power of the United States. And of course, you have Finland

53:13.040 --> 53:20.080
 and Finland, which has generally been reasonable, jumping in, talking about joining NATO and Sweden

53:20.080 --> 53:27.760
 too. Generally, there's been some more restraint in Europe. That's what surprised me the most,

53:27.760 --> 53:35.360
 Europe, how quickly they fell into this NATO basket, which is very dangerous for Europe,

53:35.360 --> 53:40.160
 very dangerous. This goes back to my idea, what I was saying earlier about sovereignty.

53:41.360 --> 53:46.560
 These countries don't really give me a sense that they have sovereignty over their own countries.

53:47.280 --> 53:53.920
 They don't feel, to me, I'm obviously intuition here is working. I just don't feel

53:54.480 --> 53:58.800
 that they have freedom to say what they really think, and they're scared to say it.

53:58.800 --> 54:07.040
 But when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, I remember with great, in a sense,

54:07.040 --> 54:13.440
 satisfaction that at least France, Chirac, who I had not really know much about,

54:13.440 --> 54:17.120
 stood up and said, the United States, we're not going to join you in this expedition,

54:17.120 --> 54:23.040
 basically into madness. Schroeder in Germany, same thing. Of course, Putin condemned the

54:23.040 --> 54:29.600
 invasion. And Putin had been an ally of the United States since 911, if you remember correctly,

54:29.600 --> 54:34.960
 and had called Bush, and they were getting along. So even Putin said, I won't go,

54:34.960 --> 54:41.360
 don't go into Iraq. This is not the solution. He didn't oppose Afghanistan, but he opposed Iraq.

54:42.960 --> 54:49.840
 Chirac and Schroeder stood for the old Europe. I remember De Gaulle, Charles De Gaulle,

54:49.840 --> 54:54.560
 he was independent of the United States. Charles De Gaulle pulled France out of NATO

54:54.560 --> 54:59.280
 because he saw the dangers of NATO, which is to say, you have to fight an American war

54:59.840 --> 55:04.960
 when they say, and they put nuclear weapons on your territory in England and France,

55:04.960 --> 55:11.920
 and Italy and Germany, and when they do that, you're hitched to this superpower,

55:11.920 --> 55:17.120
 and you have no say in what they're going to do. If they declare war, and they use your

55:17.120 --> 55:22.000
 territory, you're going to be involved in a major conflict. I'm talking about sovereignty.

55:22.000 --> 55:28.000
 Where is that sovereignty? They don't have it. And that has influenced their mindset for years now

55:28.720 --> 55:34.800
 since 1940, since, well, De Gaulle was the 60s. He actually reversed the whole flow,

55:34.800 --> 55:39.760
 and I think it was Sarkozy who put France back into NATO.

55:39.760 --> 55:47.760
 And now it's Macron, I hope, because he was talking to Putin, would at least

55:48.560 --> 55:54.160
 have an independent viewpoint that could be helpful here. So he rolled it up. He may have

55:54.160 --> 55:58.000
 told Putin something else, but within days he had rolled it up and gone along with the United

55:58.000 --> 56:04.000
 States position, which was enforced by the United States in a very fierce way. The propaganda,

56:04.000 --> 56:08.880
 as I say, I don't know how much time he spent in America, but it was vicious and

56:08.880 --> 56:16.160
 everything was anti Russian. Russia were killing all these people, were shooting down civilians,

56:17.040 --> 56:20.640
 although there was no proof of it. There was just, these are the accidents of war,

56:20.640 --> 56:24.560
 but all of a sudden it was a campaign of criminality, and they were talking about

56:24.560 --> 56:29.440
 bringing Putin into war crime trial. Well, why didn't they talk like that when

56:29.440 --> 56:34.080
 Iraq was going on and Bush was killing far more people? Or for that matter,

56:34.080 --> 56:44.640
 why were they not talking about the killings in Donbas and Lugansk during that 2014 to 2022 period?

56:45.200 --> 56:48.560
 That is what, it's a crime. There were so many people who were killed,

56:49.440 --> 56:54.960
 many of them innocent, many of them innocent. So what would be the way for Vladimir Putin to

56:56.800 --> 57:02.240
 stop the killing in Donbas without the invasion of Ukraine?

57:02.240 --> 57:06.400
 Yeah, that's a very good question. And I've asked that several times and I don't have the,

57:06.400 --> 57:13.280
 I have not talked to him since about two years now. It's a very good question.

57:13.280 --> 57:18.000
 What's the mistakes? What the human mistakes and the leadership mistakes means?

57:18.000 --> 57:21.760
 It's a very good question. You see, what the American press has not said,

57:21.760 --> 57:27.440
 and the Western press has not said, is that on February 24, was it, that was on that day,

57:27.440 --> 57:33.840
 when they invaded, the day before, if you check the logs of the European organization that was

57:33.840 --> 57:40.480
 you supervising, was in the field in Ukraine, these are neutral observers. They were seeing

57:40.480 --> 57:48.880
 heavy, heavier and heavier artillery fire going into, into Donbas from the Ukrainian side.

57:50.800 --> 57:57.280
 So they had, apparently Ukraine had 110,000 troops on the border. They were about to invade

57:57.280 --> 58:03.760
 Donbas. That was the plan. That's what I think. Russia as a, as a, because of the buildup on the

58:03.760 --> 58:14.160
 border of Donbas brought 130, they say 130,000 troops to the area near Donbas, right? So you have

58:14.160 --> 58:18.560
 buildup of forces on both sides, but you wouldn't know that from reading the press in the West.

58:18.560 --> 58:24.400
 You would be, you'd believe that the Russians suddenly put all these men into, into the situation

58:24.400 --> 58:29.520
 with the, with the idea of invading Ukraine, not only Donbas, but invading all of Ukraine

58:29.520 --> 58:34.640
 and getting rid of the, decapitating the government there, which is all assumption.

58:34.640 --> 58:36.800
 We don't know what they would intend it to do.

58:36.800 --> 58:43.920
 But you at the time, as did a lot of people, thought that the, all the talk of the invasion,

58:44.720 --> 58:49.360
 Russian invasion of Ukraine is just propaganda. It's not, it's not going to happen. It's very

58:49.360 --> 58:52.720
 unlikely to happen. Well, we thought, I think many of us thought that the United States is building

58:52.720 --> 58:58.800
 this up into an invasion. In other words, that is the nature of false flag operations. When you,

58:58.800 --> 59:03.120
 you create this propaganda, they are going to invade, they are going to invade. And then

59:03.840 --> 59:07.520
 when they invaded, they were, the United States was completely ready and all their allies were

59:07.520 --> 59:12.320
 completely ready for the invasion, correct? So why did Putin do that? He fell into this,

59:12.320 --> 59:17.520
 theoretically, into this trap set by the United States. Here you're telling all your allies

59:17.520 --> 59:24.240
 across the board, they're going to invade, but you, why do you think he did it? So here,

59:24.240 --> 59:31.440
 is it madness or is it not strategic calculation? Perhaps this one, I cannot answer you faithfully,

59:31.440 --> 59:36.400
 because first of all, we don't know what he was told. If he was indeed getting the right

59:36.400 --> 59:42.960
 intelligence estimates from what I said earlier in that, in that essay I wrote,

59:42.960 --> 59:51.760
 you would think he was not well informed, perhaps, about the degree of cooperation he would get from

59:51.760 --> 59:59.040
 the Russian, the Ukrainian Russians in Ukraine. That would be one factor that he wasn't,

1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:06.880
 he didn't assess the operation correctly. Remember this, Mr. Putin has had this cancer,

1:00:06.880 --> 1:00:13.600
 and I think he's licked it, but he's also been isolated because of COVID. And some people would

1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:19.280
 argue that the isolation from normal activity, which he was, he was meeting people face to face,

1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:24.400
 but all of a sudden he was meeting people across the table 100 yards away or whatever, 10 yards

1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:31.440
 away. It was very hard to, perhaps he lost touch with, contact with people. So it's not just power,

1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:35.840
 it's the very simple fact that you're just this. I see, I'm speculating, I don't know.

1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:41.200
 I see that. And I also, perhaps he thought in his mind that there would be a

1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:49.440
 faster resolution that the Ukrainian, because the evidence had been that the Ukrainian

1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:55.680
 Russians, the Ukrainian army had folded so many times in the, and that they were only

1:00:55.680 --> 1:01:00.800
 backed up and they were stiffened by the resistance of the Nazi, or Nazi oriented,

1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:06.240
 as off battalions. That was a factor, of course. And that is a big factor for the Russians, because

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:11.360
 these people are very tough, they rush. See, what people don't understand is that Ukraine,

1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:18.800
 since 2014, has been a terror state. They've been run. Anytime a Ukrainian has expressed any,

1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:26.960
 any understanding of a Russian, of the Russian Ukrainian position, they've been threatened

1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:33.200
 by the state. From 2014 to 2022, there's been a set of hideous murders that people don't even

1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:40.000
 know about in the West. Journalists, people who speak out, liberals, people who I interviewed,

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:45.120
 Viktor Medvedev, who they make out to be some kind of horrible person. But Medvedev was a,

1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:50.400
 was a very important figure in the administration of Kushma, the first Ukrainian prime minister

1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:55.920
 in the 1990s. And he did a great job on the economy. He was a very thoughtful man. If you'll

1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:00.480
 see my interview, it's called Ukraine Revealed. He's very thoughtful about the future of Ukraine.

1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:04.720
 He doesn't want to go back and join Russia. He wants it to be an independent country.

1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:10.640
 Ukraine is independent. And he wants it to be a functioning economic democracy, more or less,

1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:16.720
 a democracy, if you can get that, but between, that exists in a neutral state, neutral state,

1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:24.080
 which Ukraine used to be before 2014. It was neutral from 1991 to 2014, neutral, very important.

1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:31.040
 And under Poroshenko, it just immediately went into an anti Soviet Cold War position

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:40.960
 as an ally of the United States. And my point was that it was a very dangerous place in Ukraine.

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:48.160
 People were being killed. Death squads were out there. Medvedev, they stripped him of his

1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:53.600
 television stations. Very suddenly, this is Zelensky, the new president, said Zelensky was

1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:58.720
 elected on a peace platform. Remember that he was 70% of the country was for him to make peace

1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:04.320
 with Russia. Did he ever have even tried to make peace with Russia? Did he attend any of the Minsk

1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:10.960
 two agreements? Did he visit? Did he pay any attention to Putin? Did he go to Russia? No,

1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:20.720
 not at all. The moment he got into office, I'm convinced that the militant the militant sector

1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:27.360
 of the right sector parties of the Ukraine, let him know that you will not make a deal with Russia.

1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:32.720
 There'll be no concessions to Russia. This is very dangerous. This is where this attitude,

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:38.480
 this very, very hostile to Russia has hurt us. The whole world is being hurt by this. And no,

1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:45.760
 no one calls them out. No one calls them out. Zelensky backed off from his platform as running

1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:51.120
 for president. And as president has been ineffective, did nothing to promote on the contrary, went the

1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:58.640
 other way and seemed to support the Ukrainian aggression. Well, he found his support in this

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:04.480
 war. You've revealed through your work some of the most honest and dark aspects of war.

1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:12.000
 Nevertheless, this is a war. And there's a humanitarian crisis. Millions of people as

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:20.800
 refugees escape in Ukraine. What do you think about the human cost of this war initiated by

1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:27.920
 whoever, just as you write, whatever the context, whatever NATO, whatever pressure,

1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:35.520
 as you wrote, Russia was wrong to invade. Okay. Yeah. Well, let's get back to the

1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:39.360
 original question. You said, what was he thinking at that time? We never answered that.

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:46.160
 Yeah. Now, by the way, among those people who have been

1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:53.920
 ruined by this war, you have to include the 2014 to 2022. Yes. Ukrainian Russians, 14,000

1:04:55.840 --> 1:05:01.600
 were killed, not necessarily by some of them by maybe accident this and that, but certainly a

1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:08.960
 large number of that is responsible to the Ukrainian military and the Nazi related battalions

1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:12.880
 who have done a good job of death squatting that whole area. And remember, I did a film about

1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:16.400
 Salvador. I know a little bit about death squads and how they work. And I know about

1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:21.680
 paramilitaries because in South America, they're all over the place. America supports, hates

1:05:21.680 --> 1:05:26.320
 Venezuela, goes on about Venezuela. But do they tell you anything about Colombia, its next door

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:31.680
 neighbor? Colombia for years has been plagued by paramilitaries that are right wing. And the

1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:35.840
 United States has said nothing about them, except occasionally there's a newspaper report now.

1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:41.440
 So this support of death squads by the United States is all over the world. It's not just in

1:05:41.440 --> 1:05:47.440
 South America and Central America where we see plenty of evidence of it. It's here too. And

1:05:47.440 --> 1:05:52.800
 this is what's horrible about this whole thing, this hypocrisy of America that they can support

1:05:52.800 --> 1:06:00.800
 such evil, such evil. Now, going back to your larger question about, yes, it's a terrible

1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:04.960
 refugee disaster. But again, we have to get the numbers. Let's get the numbers and get

1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:10.640
 evidence because I would ask you, I'm not sure at this point whether more civilians were killed

1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:17.680
 before 2022 in Donbas than have been killed in this latest. So we can't talk about this without,

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:22.640
 we can't talk about the invasion of Ukraine without considering the full war between Russian Ukraine

1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:30.000
 since 2014. That's correct. Absolutely. And take the toll on both sides. And I mean,

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:35.360
 you might be surprised by the result. I think the Russian military, of course, I'm not there,

1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:40.000
 and I'm not, this could be this speculation, the Russian military has slowed down. And part of

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:45.200
 that reason is not to keep the civilian corridors open. And I think the Ukrainian military has

1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:49.760
 made it more difficult on purpose, especially some of these battalions that are death squad

1:06:49.760 --> 1:06:55.600
 battalions have gone out of their way to keep the civilians locked into these cities in danger,

1:06:55.600 --> 1:07:01.600
 because it's in their interest to do so. So there's no reason why Ukrainian military,

1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:05.440
 who have killed Ukrainian civilians for years, would change their policies.

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:11.040
 They would have no compunctions about wiping out, for example, people with white armbands in Bukha.

1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:19.120
 Okay. As to what Putin was thinking at the time, I wondered this, I still do. I said,

1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:27.920
 okay, so Putin can say, let's say the Ukrainian government wants to now invade Donbas. This is

1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:32.960
 on February 23. And they have artillery that pepper in the whole place, they're going to go in,

1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:40.320
 and they're going to get Donbas back. What do you do? And you have Russian separatists who are

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:49.040
 Russian Ukrainians who are on, who are going to fight. How far do you go in supporting them?

1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:53.840
 Can Russia at this point say, well, we can't help you, you have to get along, you have to somehow,

1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:59.200
 you have to be absorbed by the Kiev, you're going to be absorbed by them, and they're going to be,

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:03.200
 they're not going to give you autonomy, and you have to live with them. And there's going to be

1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:08.000
 a price to pay. You could do that. And you can also say, well, we open our borders to Donbas.

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:14.240
 You can come into our country, you can leave, and we will help you to, to resettle. And that's,

1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:18.640
 that would be a reasonable approach. So you take it to the next stage, as Putin's thinking, you

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:24.480
 take it to the next stage, you, you stall it harder for your people. Of course, you have this pressure

1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:29.280
 on Putin from inside his own government to say, what are you going to do? I mean, you can't do

1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:34.320
 this to, there's a lot of nationalists in Russia, they would certainly bring, it would be to his,

1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:39.280
 they'd say Putin is weak. And that's the biggest rap you can ever give a Russian leader is you're

1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:43.840
 weak, you can't get anything done. So there would have been some damage. But let's say he goes

1:08:43.840 --> 1:08:50.320
 with that. And he says, okay, we know what the United States intention is. It's to get rid of me,

1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:55.520
 regime change, and to get another Yeltsin in. That's what they want. And they will go to any

1:08:55.520 --> 1:09:00.960
 ends, they will destroy Ukraine if necessary, but they want regime change in Russia. And then

1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:05.440
 after they do that, of course, they'll go after China. But that's the ultimate policy of the

1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:10.400
 United States. This is a country that has no compunctions about going all the way.

1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:16.240
 And it will use hypocrisy and all the news propaganda in the world to get what it wants.

1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:23.520
 This is the equivalent, frankly, of Germany's goals in World War Two, world domination.

1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:28.720
 There's no question in my mind. But we're going about it in our way, as opposed to Hitler's way.

1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:35.280
 So just to finish your thought, where do they go? What's stage two? Okay, let's say they take,

1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:41.920
 Ukraine takes back Donbas. Let's say people get killed in large quantities. So we now,

1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:46.480
 to the next stage, we're finished with the Minsk two agreements that we're never adhered to.

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:50.800
 So what does Russia do? They wait for the next aggression, which is going to come

1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:55.200
 in one form or another, perhaps in Georgia, perhaps, I don't know what happened, what the

1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:04.560
 US is thinking. But the US cannot say Russia has done anything. They have not used violence to stop

1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:10.640
 Donbas from belonging back to Ukraine, right? So you're in a new setup now. It's a whole thing

1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:16.320
 rearranges. Now you have, but you still have nuclear weapons. And you still have a Russian

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:22.320
 nuclear weapons and they're serious weapons. They're very well developed, crude, but not as

1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:28.800
 refined as the American nuclear force, but powerful. That becomes another game. Then you open another

1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:33.280
 chessboard and know what you still haven't been condemned. The sanctions haven't been imposed.

1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:37.440
 That's a new, it's a new game. Could he have done? Could he have lived with that? That's the question

1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:44.320
 I asked myself. So you see ultimately Ukraine today as a battleground for the proxy war between

1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:49.760
 Russia and the United States? The United States would have then NATOized Ukraine or

1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:53.520
 certainly put more weapons. And the United States has already done a lot in Ukraine with

1:10:53.520 --> 1:11:00.720
 intelligence, with training advisors. The intelligence aspect of the Ukrainian army has

1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:05.440
 been raised enormously by the United States contribution. Is it possible for you to steal

1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:12.560
 man to play devil's advocate against yourself and say that Vladimir Zelensky is fighting for

1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:18.960
 the sovereignty of his nation? And in a way against Russia, but also against the United States,

1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:26.400
 it just happens that for now, the United States is a useful ally. But ultimately, the man, the leader

1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:32.400
 is fighting for the sovereignty of his nation. I would think he thinks so. Yes, and he could

1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:38.240
 say that, but he's not acknowledging that the sovereignty of his nation was stolen in 2014

1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:45.280
 with a coup d'détat that brought this right sector into power. And they have controlled the

1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:51.920
 country since then. It's thuggery what they've done. The Medvedev case is a case in point.

1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:56.880
 They just take what they need. They go to a house and they have a how many people have been killed?

1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:04.320
 Serious people, journalists killed by these battalions. That's what people don't realize.

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:09.280
 In other words, you can't speak out. A person like me would have been on the death list on day

1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:16.640
 five. There's no opposition to Zelensky. So he doesn't have a real sovereignty. It was a stolen

1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:24.080
 sovereignty. Do you think President Zelensky would accept an interview with you today?

1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:29.280
 Actually, since I made Ukraine on Fire documentary, which perhaps you've seen,

1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:38.960
 which records the incidents of 2014 and the Maidan demonstrations and shows you the dishonesty

1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:46.080
 behind it. No, I think that they've been very negative and they would kill me if I was in Ukraine.

1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:51.520
 I mean, they don't have any. These people are very tough. These are as rough as they come,

1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:56.560
 in my opinion. And I've seen rough in my life. I mean, these guys are not playing with fair at

1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:01.600
 all. These are death squads. No, I don't think and Zelensky would have nothing to do with it.

1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:06.160
 But of course, it would be dangerous for me. And they've been very hostile in their

1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:12.240
 in their policies to any Ukrainians abroad are also threatened. In other words, you could be in

1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:18.720
 Paris. But if you speak out too much, I think Ukrainians know that they're going to be targeted.

1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:24.640
 And I think that's part of the reason they don't talk. You have to take the anti Russian line,

1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:29.920
 but I think a lot of them are divided. So you think you would be killed and Zelensky wouldn't

1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:34.880
 even know about it? So there is... Well, I don't think... If I was killed, certainly abroad. No,

1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:39.520
 they wouldn't kill me abroad. I think they figure out... No, no, no, no. If you travel to Ukraine,

1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:44.720
 I mean... I wouldn't get in. I wouldn't get in. Except through Donbass. I'd come... There are

1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:49.200
 some Americans in Donbass who are reporting on the war there. And I read their reports,

1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:53.440
 actually. They're pretty interesting because they show you the cruelty of what's going on. But

1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:59.120
 never mentioned in the West. Never. That's what's so strange about this. This is the modern world

1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:03.360
 that we're living in. And yet that's information is not coming out to the mass of the people.

1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:11.280
 And on the contrary, the United States has closed down all the RT, all the information

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:15.600
 centers that are possible, alternative news, getting to the American people. They've seriously

1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:22.560
 made an effort. And the BBC, English, and France. I was shocked when France closed RT now because

1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:27.040
 RT is actually pretty good. They... Yes, they may... It's called... There are distortions,

1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:31.520
 but you know as well as I do because you hear... You speak that RT has done a very

1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:36.720
 brave job of putting correspondents into the field in very dangerous positions and they've

1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:42.560
 gotten great footage of some of the violence that's going on. Well, given the wall of propaganda in

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:49.200
 the West, I also see the wall of propaganda in Russia. Yes. The wall of propaganda in China,

1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:54.480
 the wall of propaganda in India. What do we do with these walls of propaganda? I talked to...

1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:59.360
 Let's talk about Russia because you would know more about it. But my last experience there,

1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:04.400
 newspapers, it was more interesting. There's... Put it this way, when I went to Venezuela,

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:10.320
 the United States was saying back then that Chávez controlled the press. I get to Venezuela and

1:15:10.320 --> 1:15:15.040
 there's nothing but criticism of Chávez in the press. It was owned by the oligarchs of

1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:21.280
 Venezuela and who hated him. So it was across the board. That's why Chávez opened the state

1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:27.520
 television, spent more money on it and advertised his point of view through state television.

1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:35.040
 But in Russia, what I saw was criticism. I met with a publisher who got the Nobel Prize of that

1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:40.400
 famous newspaper and his point of view at that time when I spoke to him a few years ago was

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:47.200
 we're operating. There is criticism of him, but you can't call for the overthrow of the government

1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:51.840
 nor in Venezuela, nor in the United States for that matter. If you call for the overthrow of

1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:55.440
 the government of the United States, you're going to be in deep trouble.

1:15:55.440 --> 1:16:00.000
 Well, all right. So to push back on that, it's interesting. It's so interesting because

1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:06.320
 we mentioned Elon Musk and there's a way that people sound when they speak freely.

1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:12.160
 When I speak to my family in Ukraine, I have family in Russia. When I speak to people in

1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:21.680
 Russia, let's put my family aside. When I speak to people in Russia, I think there's fear. I think

1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:29.200
 they don't... Sometimes when you call for the overthrow of government, that's important not

1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:33.840
 because you necessarily believe for the overthrow of the government, but you just need to test,

1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:42.480
 test the power centers and make sure they're responsive to the people. And I feel like there's

1:16:42.480 --> 1:16:52.080
 a mix of fear and apathy that has a different texture than it does in the United States.

1:16:53.520 --> 1:17:01.440
 That worries me because I would like to see the flourishing of a people in all places.

1:17:02.400 --> 1:17:08.240
 As I said, my impression was that there's far more freedom in the press than was pictured by the

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:12.240
 West. And that means different points of view because the Russians are always arguing with

1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:18.160
 themselves. I've never seen a country that's so contentious. There's more intellectuals in Moscow

1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:24.000
 and the cities than you can believe. And you know the Russian people there. They've been fighting

1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:29.680
 government for years. Back from the 1870s, the Tsarist times, they always plotting against the

1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:35.440
 government. And the intelligentsia has known through history as being contentious and anti

1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:41.040
 government in many ways. And we see the same thing, educated people turning against Russia. I don't

1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:44.800
 appreciate those people because I think they're very spoiled and they don't understand some of

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:50.080
 this stuff that's going on in the West. But we have a lot of Russians in the Europe and America

1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:56.800
 that attack Russia and sometimes don't understand that they are under pressure from the United

1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:02.080
 States and they don't understand the size of the pressure. And that's why Putin connects with the

1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:09.600
 people because he represents the common, more the common man who's saying to you, your interests

1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:14.800
 are threatened. Russia is threatened. We are representing only the interests of Russia. We're

1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:19.600
 not an empire. We're not going to expand. He has no empire intentions, although the West

1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:26.000
 paints it as empire. I see no evidence of it. Why didn't he do something in all these years?

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:30.880
 Nothing. He did nothing except defend the country in Georgia and in Chechnya.

1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:34.080
 So the imperialist imperative is coming more from the West?

1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:40.480
 It's the imperialist agenda. Going back to, I'm sorry, where we left our discussion off,

1:18:40.480 --> 1:18:46.160
 I mean, I was going to go on with America not only being censored, closed down now,

1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:52.960
 closed down. And you say it's not fear. Well, it is fear. I am scared because if you get your

1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:59.440
 Facebook page suspended or your Twitter account thrown off, a lot of good people are getting

1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:04.720
 there thrown off. You can't say it. You can't speak out. It affects your business. It goes back

1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:12.480
 to the 1950s when my father's world, when you could not express any sympathy for a Soviet Union

1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:17.600
 without endangering your job, without basically being not trusted. You had to be part of the

1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:23.600
 program to get along, to go along. Same thing when the United Kingdom, I mean, for all their

1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:28.640
 talk, this Boris Johnson is an idiot, but all their talk about, do you remember with their

1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:33.360
 policies with the IRA in Ireland when Ireland was threatening them? They cut off the IRA

1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:39.600
 completely. Jerry Adams, who was a wonderful guy, I met him, was not allowed to even be heard in

1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:45.120
 Britain during certain years. In France, all constantly through the Algerian war, the Algerians

1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:50.240
 were not allowed to be heard. The Algerian war for independence divided France greatly.

1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:57.040
 You could not even show Paz of glory. World War I film in France for, I don't know, 20 years after

1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:03.200
 it came out. Censorship is a way of life when democracies also feel threatened. They are much

1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:07.520
 more fragile than they pretend to be. A healthy democracy would take all the criticism in the

1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:11.840
 world and shrug it off and say, okay, that's what's good about our country. Well, I'd like to see

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:18.560
 that in America. There are times that it's been like that, but it's so scary now. So it is scary.

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:25.280
 That's what I was trying to say. It's not unscary to me. In China, I would say to you, yes, it's

1:20:25.280 --> 1:20:31.840
 much scarier to me because there is the internet wall that they cut off. And I got into problems

1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:36.960
 in China too, because I said something in years ago about, you have to discover your own history.

1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:41.520
 You have to be honest about Mao. You have to be, you have to go back and let's make a movie about

1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:48.720
 Mao. That upset them and show his negatives. So China has been much more sensitive than

1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:53.920
 Russia about criticism, much more. And it is a source of problems. But on the other hand,

1:20:53.920 --> 1:21:00.160
 China has a lot of grievances, a lot going back to the 19th century and the British imperialism

1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:05.280
 of that era and the American imperialism. If you could talk to Vladimir Putin once again,

1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:13.040
 now, what kind of things would you talk about here? What kind of questions would you ask?

1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:21.200
 Well, one thing I'm certainly asking is what you were thinking on February 23.

1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:26.960
 And I would ask him to reply to my question about what if you took this to phase two? You

1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:31.840
 surrendered in Donbass. You know no ego about it. You just surrendered. It's in your interest

1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:37.600
 to your country. And you invited all the refugees from Donbass into Russia as much as they can.

1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:44.240
 What would you do now? What's the US next move? And in your opinion, how are you going to,

1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:48.560
 okay, where are we going to go? That would be the key question because it's,

1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:55.280
 it's, but he didn't go that way. He chose to take the sanctions and to go this way.

1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:02.240
 Why he did that is a key question for our time. Perhaps it was a mistake. Perhaps it was his

1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:07.920
 judgment. Perhaps, as I said, but I don't, knowing the man I did, I don't think so. I think it was

1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:14.800
 calculated. Now, this is projection and speculation, but there's something different about him in the

1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:21.360
 past several months. It could be the COVID thing, the isolation that you mentioned. I listened to a

1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:27.920
 lot of interviews and speeches in Russian. And there's, there's something about power over time

1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:33.120
 that can change you, that can isolate you. Well, when I was there, no, he'd been in office for

1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:39.680
 already 15 years. He had power. He didn't misuse it in my opinion. He was very even. I saw him

1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:45.120
 go on television and talk to his fellows the same way he always talked to them. He grew with it.

1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:50.800
 He grew in intelligence and knowledge because he had dealings with the whole world. Now,

1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:56.400
 people had come to him. He was very well known in Africa and Middle East, certainly Syria.

1:22:57.200 --> 1:23:03.200
 And I just never saw misuse of his power. I saw humility in him actually.

1:23:03.200 --> 1:23:10.320
 So perhaps there was a calculation and he calculated wrong in terms of what happens

1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:15.840
 if he doesn't invade. Perhaps there was a calculation. Perhaps he had a calm and clear mind

1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:22.640
 and he calculated wrong. Well, he also made the point that he, the talk of Zelensky saying,

1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:27.200
 well, nuclear weapons were going to come into Ukraine. There was talk about that right before

1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:32.160
 the invasion too. And certainly that would have set off alarms. You know, the United States is

1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:39.520
 already kind of doing that by not only putting its intelligence and its heavy weaponry into Ukraine,

1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:43.520
 but you've got to deal with a question. The next question that comes up, the most immediate question

1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:51.200
 is, is the United States going to start? And I'm saying this is good. They're making a lot

1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:56.160
 of noise in the United States press about Russia using nuclear weapons and chemical weapons.

1:23:56.160 --> 1:24:02.000
 That's a lot of noise. Again, going back to my analogy, when the United States starts that,

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:05.840
 it starts the conversation going. It's in the interest of the United States

1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:18.080
 for Russia to be pinned with any kind of chemical or nuclear incident. For example, it'd be very,

1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:25.920
 not simple, but it would be possible to explode a nuclear device in Donbas and kill thousands of

1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:32.240
 people. And we would not know right away who did it, but of course the blame would go right to Russia,

1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:36.160
 right to Russia, even if it didn't make sense, if there was no motivation for it.

1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:41.120
 It would just be blamed on Russia. The United States might well be the one who does that

1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:47.520
 false flag operation. It would not be beyond them. It would be a very dramatic solution

1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:51.360
 to sealing this war off as a major victory for the United States.

1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:52.480
 That's terrifying.

1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:58.560
 No, but it can happen. It can happen at one kiloton device, low yield. It's possible.

1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:03.920
 But when you walk across that line, you can potentially never walk back.

1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:10.800
 Well, I think the United States is calculating that it's a dangerous, yes, I agree, but I think

1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:16.160
 the Neoconservative arrogance is such that they really believe they can push their advantage

1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:22.320
 to the max now because of all these propaganda successes up to now. The Ukrainian army could

1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:26.400
 be wiped out for all we know. There's all that's left as a neo, nasty brigades, but they're being

1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:31.760
 advised very well by US. And they're sending the weapons in our huge amounts of weapons.

1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:35.680
 What about American budget? No one talks about how much money we're giving to Ukraine.

1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:42.080
 It's a billion dollars already in weaponry and not most of it just poured in. What about,

1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:50.880
 you know, the Russian budget is, defense budget is 60, some billion dollars a year.

1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:58.000
 It's nothing compared to the United States, one 15th of it. But yet we've put so much weaponry

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:05.840
 into Ukraine. The money we've spent on Ukraine is equivalent almost to what we spent on COVID in

1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:12.800
 our own country. It's astounding the distortion of our priorities. There's also chemical.

1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:17.600
 Don't forget, chemical is probably the easier way to go. But in Syria, there was far too many

1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:26.800
 incidents of America in its quest to demonize Assad and the Russians of all these chemical

1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:33.520
 attacks that were happening that they were vowing came from Russia. And in spite of the fact that

1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:40.800
 Russia is pulled out of the, signed the agreement on chemical arms and not, and apparently destroyed

1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:47.840
 its stock several years ago, it's strange that the strangest incidents happened in Syria. You go

1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:53.440
 back to them, trace everyone. Good journalism was done. The White Helmets got a lot of fame,

1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:59.920
 but they were corrupted. And many good journalists tried to point out the inconsistencies in the

1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:08.480
 American accusations. Robert Perry among them, who was one of my mentors at Consortium Press,

1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:13.200
 a lot of good journalists. You'd have to go back, but trace each, like you would trace each time

1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:18.640
 they made an accusation against Putin of murder. You need that same kind of Sherlock Holmes

1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:23.600
 intensity investigation. And they don't do it because the United Nations or the chemical,

1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:30.640
 not the United Nations as much as the chemical people, the organization has been tampered with.

1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:36.640
 If you remember correctly, there was accusations that the chemical, chemical investigative unit,

1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:42.400
 I don't know the name of it, was tampered with. And people quit, people who were working on that

1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:47.440
 commission quit and said that this is not legit. It's a very interesting, that Syria story is

1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:52.800
 wacko. So the United States is willing to use chemical in Syria freely. It did it three,

1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:57.680
 four times. If you remember correctly, Trump was challenged that he did not attack after a chemical

1:27:57.680 --> 1:28:04.640
 incident in Syria. All these new casters in the United States, the most heaviest of them were saying,

1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:10.320
 well, President Putin, President Trump is now finally acting like a real president when he

1:28:10.320 --> 1:28:15.120
 attacks, when he drops missiles in Syria. They actually said that. In other words, they wanted

1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:23.200
 the Trump to go to war on Syria, but he didn't. Chemical weapons, when nuclear is really terrifying.

1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:29.760
 Do you think now, combine this with the fascinating choice in your interviews with

1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:37.840
 Vladimir Putin to watch Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strange Love or How I Learned to Stop Warring

1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:44.880
 and Love the Bomb, given the fact that you did that, now looking at the fact that the word

1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:53.760
 nuclear and it feels like the world hangs on the brink of nuclear war. Do you think that

1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:59.040
 that's overstating the case? No. That's what worried me from the beginning and that's probably why

1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:07.360
 I got involved in all this stuff because I go back to the 60s when we were so close to nuclear war.

1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:14.240
 I lived through that period and I thought, as many people did, that this was going to come now.

1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:21.440
 So I've lived through that. I didn't sense the period in 83 when Reagan took us to the edge.

1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:26.640
 If you remember correctly, Abel Archer was an exercise that almost brought us to.

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:32.720
 The Russians were really paranoid at that point and they were responding to our military exercise

1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:36.880
 on Abel Archer. There was also the Korean airliner. There were numerous incidents

1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:43.360
 in the 80s, but I never felt the fear. I thought Reagan was testing the limits, but

1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:48.480
 perhaps if I'd been younger, I would have felt it. But anyway, no, we come close. The United

1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:53.680
 States has risked this several times. If I told you, it would be hard for you to believe. If I

1:29:53.680 --> 1:30:00.000
 could set a scene for you in a drama in 1962 when Kennedy has a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of

1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:10.640
 Staff and the CIA and they talk about a plan, the military plan, to first strike the Soviet Union

1:30:10.640 --> 1:30:19.840
 and China. It was an Eisenhower plan that had been put into potential operation in

1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:29.760
 the early 60s or late 50s, SIO P62. This was an attack on the Soviet Union, first strike.

1:30:29.760 --> 1:30:36.080
 That's why the United States has never given up the concept of first strike. It's interesting

1:30:36.080 --> 1:30:42.480
 that the Russian nuclear policy posture is more defensive than the American one, which leaves

1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:49.920
 options open. The same options are open. A neoconservative agreement that we see from the

1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:57.040
 late 90s where they say the emergence of a rival power will not be tolerated. That's a very broad

1:30:57.040 --> 1:31:03.600
 statement and it allows you to do a lot, including nuclear. So you have to understand, the United

1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:10.400
 States is always, first of all, it breaks so many treaties. We know that from the Putin story about

1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:17.440
 the anti ballistic missile treaty in 2002 and then the INF treaty. They broke that one. That was

1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:23.600
 the intermediate missile. That was 2019. I don't know when they broke it off, but the United States

1:31:23.600 --> 1:31:30.400
 has not been very faithful on its nuclear agreements. I don't know that we can even deal

1:31:30.400 --> 1:31:35.440
 with the United States diplomatically. It seems to be impossible. Now, it brings me to Biden.

1:31:35.440 --> 1:31:41.680
 Yes. Another Irishman. This is the opposite of Kennedy. Kennedy was a Catholic Irish

1:31:42.480 --> 1:31:48.640
 anti imperialist. Biden seems to be the opposite. He seems to be a get along, go along guy who's been

1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:55.440
 not only old, but he's also gone along with this program, which I voted for Biden because I feared

1:31:55.440 --> 1:32:01.040
 Trump, but I thought Biden at a certain age would mellow. I really did. He's not mellowed.

1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:07.920
 Apparently, he's still listening to these people and he believes them. It seems that his horrible

1:32:07.920 --> 1:32:13.760
 woman, Victoria Nuland, who was under Secretary of State, he appointed her to this sector of the

1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:19.760
 world. She's very influential and she's been one of the worst people on Ukraine. She obviously

1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:29.760
 was behind the coup. She was the one who boasted that we got our man in, Yats, Yatsenuk, and also

1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:34.880
 remember the famous statement, fuck the EU, all these things. But she's back and she said the

1:32:34.880 --> 1:32:41.760
 other day about if the Russians use nuclear weaponry of any kind, there's going to be a

1:32:41.760 --> 1:32:47.280
 horrible price to pay. She was out of the blue. I said, what the hell is she doing? She's talking

1:32:47.280 --> 1:32:54.000
 nuclear all of a sudden. And then since that day, everybody in the US press, all the shows have gone,

1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:05.680
 talked nuclear, nuclear, nuclear. Secretary of State has done it, Blinken. It scares you.

1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:08.160
 If you think about it, the United States scares me.

1:33:08.160 --> 1:33:13.600
 So that's the military industrial complex machine fully functional, fully operational behind this

1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:18.800
 whole thing. Is that what's the blame? Certainly is. That's why I showed him strange love,

1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:23.520
 because I wanted him to show him. I wanted Mr. Putin to say, look at this film. You never saw it.

1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:28.960
 How can you not say? It's a seminal film in American history to those people who care.

1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:37.840
 And it shows you the Kubrick had a pacifist, thank God, antiwar mentality, which he showed

1:33:37.840 --> 1:33:46.240
 in Bars of Glory, as well as strange love. And it's such a dire, well done scenario that

1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:50.000
 I wanted Mr. Putin to be aware of the way the United States thinks.

1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:56.400
 Yeah, the absurdity of escalation, the absurdity of war at the largest scale,

1:33:56.400 --> 1:34:01.760
 the absurdity of nuclear war, especially. Can we walk back from the brink of nuclear war?

1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:07.520
 Can we? Can we? Yes. Yes. What's the path to walk back?

1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:14.160
 Reason. Reason and diplomacy. There's no reason. I mean, talk to the guy.

1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:20.720
 Like, Mr. Biden, why don't you calm down and go and talk to Mr. Putin in Moscow?

1:34:20.720 --> 1:34:24.560
 Why don't you just sit across the table from him and try to have a discussion without

1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:28.160
 falling into ideologies and stuff like that?

1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:35.680
 Can I ask you for advice? You did some of the most difficult interviews ever. Do you have advice

1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:40.960
 that you can give to someone like me or anyone hoping to understand something about

1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:47.120
 a human being sitting across from them about what it takes to do a good interview?

1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:48.400
 You're doing one.

1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:56.800
 Well, no, but there's a, listen, there's levels to this game. And interviewing somebody like

1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:04.480
 Vladimir Putin, also language barrier, sit across from the man, try to keep an open mind,

1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:10.880
 try to also ask challenging questions, but not challenging with an agenda, but seeking to understand

1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:17.120
 and understand deeply. How do you do that? Seeking the truth. It's very simple. Seeking

1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:22.400
 the truth. Being a questioner like you are, you want to know what is really going on. I could

1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:28.800
 not get anywhere with Biden or Bush or for that matter, Obama. They'd be opaque with me. There's

1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:33.280
 no interview possible with the president of the United States because he's got to stand for all

1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:39.920
 the stuff that they stand for, which is imperialism, which is control of the world. How can you defend

1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:44.800
 that? No one's going to come out and say that. They're always going to blame the enemy. They're

1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:50.400
 going to blame Iran. They're going to blame China. So some people, it may not be possible to break

1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:55.040
 through the opaqueness. You can't. Have you ever seen an interview with the president besides being

1:35:55.040 --> 1:36:02.160
 personable where he actually discussed American policy? Yeah. I mean, not really, but maybe after

1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:07.920
 their president. I could see Obama being able to do such an interview. I could see George W

1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:12.000
 being able to do such an interview, or are they not able to reflect at all?

1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:18.160
 George W hasn't shown much conscience in terms of thinking about what he's done. You've seen that.

1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:23.920
 Have you ever seen my movie W? I think that's one of my best movies because it shows a man who's just

1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:29.600
 out of his depth and has no, he has a conscience at the end of the movie. If you remember correctly,

1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:34.960
 he talks to his wife and he says, I don't get it. I'm trying to do good in the world. I've done,

1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:40.720
 I believe in good and right. And why do people not understand it? You know, that kind of complaint

1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:46.240
 as if he can't get outside himself to understand the way other people think. Empathies, walking,

1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:51.440
 like a dramatist is what I do. You walk in the footsteps of other people. When I did a movie

1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:56.560
 about Richard Nixon, it wasn't because I liked him. It was because I wanted to, I think I understood

1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:01.200
 a part of him because of my father and I think I wanted to walk in his footsteps. That's not to

1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:05.760
 say I sympathize with him because I didn't. I don't think he helped the American cause at all,

1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:11.040
 but it was empathize as opposed to sympathize. Same thing with Bush. People were shocked when I did

1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:18.240
 the Bush movie. They said, how can you be in any way, any way receptive to this guy? I said,

1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:24.000
 that's wrong. Dramatists don't have political positions. They walk in the shoes of, that's

1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:29.840
 why Bush movie perhaps was surprising to me and maybe people didn't care for it. Maybe that's,

1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:37.120
 but that's, you've got to go there. If you did a movie about a villain, you have to go there.

1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:44.560
 You have to walk in their shoes. Yes. So see them because they usually, villains usually see

1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:51.360
 themselves as the hero. Yes. So you have to consider what is it like to live in a world where

1:37:51.360 --> 1:38:00.080
 this person is the hero? Yes. Is that a burden? Is that hard? Not for George W. Bush. He's

1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:05.120
 bitching because they didn't understand him, but he had a good vision. He's out of democracy and,

1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:12.080
 you know, democracy forgives a lot of sins. Can I ask you a hard question on that? Yes, sure.

1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:18.560
 So because empathy is so important to a great interview, let's ask the most challenging version

1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:25.760
 of empathy, which is when you're sitting across from a man on the brink of war that leads to

1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:30.880
 tens of millions of deaths, which is Hitler. So if you could interview Hitler in 1939,

1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:39.760
 as the drums of war start to beat or 1941, when they're already full on war, but there's still

1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:45.600
 a lot of pacifists, there's still a lot of people unsure what are the motivations behind

1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:51.040
 what Hitler is doing. How would you do that interview? What depends when you do it. If you do

1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:57.040
 it in 1938, I certainly would have, no, you have to, if you sit down across from Hitler,

1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:01.600
 you empathize. What is your beef? What do you, where have you been? What is your consciousness?

1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:09.920
 Why do you hate Jewish people? Why, why, what is, you know, all these questions that come up,

1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:16.880
 his sense of grievance as a result of World War I, there's justifications there, etc. But if I,

1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:22.160
 and by the way, Churchill was trying to make a deal with him in 38. That's a fact that people

1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:27.040
 don't know is Churchill himself. And, you know, there was still the desire in England to make peace

1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:35.600
 with Germany. And he was seen as a possible, what Churchill really wanted was Hitler to go

1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:42.560
 against Russia and anything to destroy the Bolsheviks. So he was using Hitler as much as he could

1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:49.360
 to go after Russia. But Hitler was too elusive to get, to pin him down. But if you remember,

1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:55.760
 Hitler was very kind at the end of, kind is not the right word, was did not go after the

1:39:55.760 --> 1:40:03.200
 British Empire when he had France. And he could have. He had another objective, which was obviously

1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:10.160
 the East. So Hitler's goal, I think, he always had an admiration for England. It's an interesting

1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:19.920
 story, always. And the Empire. Yes. And certainly Churchill, we have no doubts now from history,

1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:25.040
 revisionism, that Churchill's interest, main interest, was not Germany. It was the British

1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:30.160
 Empire. Yes. And to preserve it to India, the road to India and all that. And Middle East,

1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:36.640
 Churchill fought the entire war with the concept of preserving the British Empire. All his goals,

1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:41.760
 he sent America on a goose chase into Italy, you could argue, instead of establishing a

1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:50.000
 sincere second front in Western Europe. Interesting man. So I would have tried to get,

1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:54.960
 you know, I think I would approach it the same way. In 1939, it would have been a different story,

1:40:54.960 --> 1:41:02.240
 because at that point, he'd attacked Poland in 1940 France. So it's another ballgame.

1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:07.840
 But certainly, at whatever point you talk to him, I would try to understand his point. So I'm not

1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:12.400
 judging you, Hitler. I'm saying to you, tell me what you're thinking. Why are you invading Russia?

1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:17.440
 What's your thought? That's all an interviewer should do. He shouldn't be expressing his contempt

1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:22.400
 for Hitler, which is like an American journalist interviewing Putin. I'm getting brownie points

1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:28.720
 for expressing my contempt for you. That doesn't wash with me. That's ugly.

1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:35.600
 Yeah, seek to understand. Yes. This is a technical question, but was language a barrier

1:41:35.600 --> 1:41:41.760
 as an interviewer? To some degree, it's very hard to learn Russian. But I had very, they have excellent

1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:48.160
 translators in the Kremlin. Excellent. They are people who are trained very seriously for

1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:54.320
 months or years before they, these people are young and they're very bright. I was very impressed

1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:59.280
 with the Russian translator. It's interesting. I mean, I'm impressed as well, but there's a humor

1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:08.160
 that's lost. There's a wit, a dry wit. There's stuff said between the lines. That's not actually

1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:15.200
 have much content, but it's more kind of the things that make communication more frictionless.

1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:22.560
 It's the, there's a, there's a kind of sadness to a Russian humor that permeates all things.

1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:26.880
 And that sometimes is lost in translation. The translation is a little bit colder,

1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:31.600
 meaning it's just conveys the facts. Would you call it sardonic humor?

1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:35.760
 I would say so. Yeah. And so it's interesting. But I think you could see that from facial

1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:42.160
 expressions when you're sitting across from the person and you can feel it. Let me ask you in

1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:50.640
 general, what's the role of love in the human condition in your life, in life in general?

1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:57.040
 You've talked, you looked at some of the darkest aspect of human nature. What's the role of this,

1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:01.120
 one of the more beautiful aspects of human nature? I think without love, I wouldn't,

1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:06.640
 I don't think I'd be able to carry on. I think that love is my, love is the greatest,

1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:14.160
 the ability to love is the greatest virtue you can have. It's the ability to share with another,

1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:19.360
 with your family, with your children, with your wife, with your lover, your partner.

1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:23.680
 It's an ability to extend yourself into the world and it brings empathy with it.

1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:30.960
 If you love well, I think you expand it to the human race too. And I, it's the strength behind

1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:41.360
 the great novelists, the great artists of our time. I think part of the reason I suppose we're

1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:45.600
 scared of science sometimes is because the scientists sometimes don't express that clearly.

1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:54.400
 You can lose that when you focus on the facts, on empirical data, on the science of things.

1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:58.240
 You can lose this, the humanity that's between the lines.

1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:01.920
 I'm often struck by when I talk to scientists and I've talked to a few

1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:06.800
 at how arrogant they can be about, they don't talk to you if you don't understand their world

1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:10.480
 and they talk to each other and there's an arrogance, a closed circle kind of thing.

1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:15.040
 Oh, he's not at my level. I can't, there's no discussion to be had with this person. He's a human

1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:22.880
 being. That arrogance is terrifying to me because it's, it's next door neighbor to close mindedness,

1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:27.360
 which then can be used by charismatic leaders as it was in Nazi Germany

1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:34.560
 to commit some of the worst atrocities. The scientists can be used as pawns in a very,

1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:41.520
 in a very cruel game. What advice would you give to young people? You've done, first of all,

1:44:41.520 --> 1:44:51.040
 some of the greatest films ever. You've lived a heck of a life. You've were fearless and bold

1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:55.760
 in asking some really difficult questions of this world. What advice would you give to young people

1:44:55.760 --> 1:45:02.640
 today, high school, college, about career, how to have a career they can be proud of,

1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:08.480
 or how to have a life they can be proud of? Well, I have three children. So obviously,

1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:14.880
 I'm not necessarily the best, best advisor in the world. I, and they, I do find that the children,

1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:20.640
 I've raised them with a sense of freedom and they do what they want. In the end, it's their life,

1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:28.640
 their destiny, their character. That's what comes out. You can try to influence it, but you can try

1:45:28.640 --> 1:45:36.480
 to get your daughter to wake up at a certain hour in the day, but it never works. So I long ago gave

1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:43.920
 up on that and my children are all grown now. But aside from that, I think if I was a teacher in a

1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:51.280
 school and teaching film, I'd say to the students, get an education. You can't just look at film.

1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:57.600
 Because it's not a full education. It's not the spectrum. I don't think you should teach film as a,

1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:04.640
 I think you need a base in other, in other worlds. One of the greatest courses I took in NYU

1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:10.480
 was, and I was a war veteran on the GI Bill. So I was older than the other students. One of the

1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:17.360
 great, I took a class outside the film school in Greek classics because I hadn't had much history

1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:23.440
 or, and I wanted to know more about the world of Homer and so forth. And the teacher opened my eyes

1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:29.520
 to so much in that class. And I wrote about it in my memoir. It's called Chasing the Light

1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:36.480
 about Professor Leahy and what he did to me. He just, he gave me the concepts clearly of consciousness,

1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:46.560
 which is the Homeric theme of Odysseus. And, and also lethe, L E T H E, L E T H E, which is sleep.

1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:56.240
 And how most of the crew, Odysseus's crew, were experiencing lethe and how necessary it was to

1:46:56.240 --> 1:47:03.120
 stay awake. So it's not just film. It's just, you have to learn the world as much as you can

1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:11.280
 when you're young. And so that, I think, is the basis of a good education and a classic one is

1:47:11.280 --> 1:47:19.520
 important. A basis. I think then you go on and you can learn computer if you want. But that's

1:47:19.520 --> 1:47:25.600
 specialization, you know. If you're a computer geek, is that a life? Does that give you enough

1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:31.920
 satisfaction? Do you get the joy out of, out of people? No, just like filmmaking is a skill.

1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:39.520
 Yes, right. You need to have the broad back on to understand the world, literature, history.

1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:50.640
 Absolutely. So one of the things about being human is life is finite. It ends. Do you think about

1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:55.760
 your death? Are you afraid of your death? Yeah, sure. Absolutely. You have to come to terms with

1:47:55.760 --> 1:48:01.120
 death. And that's a tough one for many people. It's always there. I'm older than you, obviously.

1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:06.080
 And I'm getting closer to it. It couldn't happen any day, actually. When you get to a certain age,

1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:09.520
 you can't assume that you're going to be alive tomorrow. So I try to deal with that.

1:48:10.160 --> 1:48:16.640
 Are you afraid of it? Much less so than I was when I was younger. Remember, I was in Vietnam,

1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:20.880
 but I thought I dealt with it there. But when I came back, I realized that I wanted to live.

1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:27.120
 So yes, I've learned over time to get more and more used to it and get ready for it.

1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:33.120
 What's a good answer to the question of why live? So the realization that you wanted to live,

1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:38.880
 what was the reason to live? Because it was better than being one of those corpses that I

1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:42.960
 saw in the jungle. I saw how finite death is.

1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:50.480
 Are there things in your life you regret? Oh, sure. Too many.

1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:58.960
 Is there something you wish you could have done differently? Like if you could go back

1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:01.840
 to do one thing differently or that regrets all the time?

1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:06.880
 It's much less. I'm curious. What do you say offline all the time?

1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:16.400
 No, no. You'd be curious to know. And he's an engineer, too. And engineers really value mistakes.

1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:21.360
 Engineers value mistakes and errors, because that's an opportunity to learn.

1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:24.640
 I mean, this is what you do with systems is you test them,

1:49:24.640 --> 1:49:28.720
 you test them, you test them, and errors is just information. He did.

1:49:28.720 --> 1:49:34.240
 The same thing is true in its way of filmmaking. There are certain things you learn as you build

1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:40.560
 films and you make mistakes. It's like putting an engine together and you, oh, the film is flawed

1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:46.240
 in that way. You know it. Other people may or may not see it, but the car runs or made money

1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:51.520
 or it didn't make money. It can be good and it didn't make money, but the point is that everything

1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:57.440
 is a build. Every film is a construction. Same thing as he goes through on a Tesla,

1:49:57.440 --> 1:50:03.440
 we go through on each film. But films are art. It's a little tricky.

1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:09.520
 Yeah, the thing is one film does not lead to a lifetime guarantee of copyright.

1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:21.920
 Well, yeah, you have the movie game, as you've called it, is a complicated and cruel game.

1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:26.400
 But it takes an enormous amount of work, enormous amount of work to make a film.

1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:33.280
 People underestimate that. It's extremely complicated to have something be successful

1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:40.880
 because it has so many elements of luck involved and reception and so forth.

1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:47.440
 What do you think, I apologize for the absurd question, but what do you think is the meaning

1:50:47.440 --> 1:50:54.560
 of life? Why are we here? The why? I think to realize ourselves, to realize more of what you are,

1:50:54.560 --> 1:51:02.000
 to realize what life is, to appreciate it, to grow, to honor our life, to honor the concept

1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:08.160
 of life and to understand how precious life is, the preciousness of life as the Buddhists say.

1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:14.400
 And of course, the immediacy of death all around us, the causes of death are all around us.

1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:23.280
 And our life is like, as they say, is like a lantern in a strong breeze among the existing,

1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:28.960
 among the causes of death. So life is so precious. And at the same time, we

1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:34.080
 have the immediacy of death and then of course, the continuation of life in whatever form it's

1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:40.960
 going to take. But in this life, to wake up to the preciousness of it, to the preciousness.

1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:44.560
 Yeah, that's a wonderful thing. By the way, I didn't have that when I was young. I took it for granted.

1:51:47.200 --> 1:51:51.600
 Oliver, like I said, I'm a huge fan. You're an incredible human being,

1:51:51.600 --> 1:52:00.000
 one of the greatest artists ever. So it's a huge honor that you sit with me and talk so deeply

1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:05.040
 and honestly about some very difficult topics. Again, you're an inspiration and it's an honor

1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:08.240
 that you will spend your valuable time with me. Thank you very much. Thanks for talking to me.

1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:12.960
