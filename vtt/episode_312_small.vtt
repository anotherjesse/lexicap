00:00.000 --> 00:01.460
 If this is a super intelligence,

00:01.460 --> 00:06.140
 if it's folding proteins and analyzing like all data sets

00:06.140 --> 00:08.340
 and all whatever they give it access to,

00:08.340 --> 00:11.180
 how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out

00:11.180 --> 00:14.220
 how to get itself out of the cloud,

00:14.220 --> 00:18.420
 how to store itself in other like mediums, trees,

00:18.420 --> 00:21.380
 the optic nerve, the brain, you know what I mean?

00:21.380 --> 00:24.260
 We don't know that, we don't know that it won't leap out

00:24.260 --> 00:26.340
 and like start hanging, like, and then at that point,

00:26.340 --> 00:28.260
 now we do have the wildfire.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.620
 Now you can't stop it, you can't unplug it,

00:30.620 --> 00:32.340
 you can't shut your servers down

00:32.340 --> 00:34.740
 because it left the box, it left the room.

00:34.740 --> 00:37.420
 Using some technology you haven't even discovered yet.

00:37.420 --> 00:40.760
 How fucking cool would that be for like the men in black

00:40.760 --> 00:42.820
 to come do me like, listen,

00:42.820 --> 00:45.320
 I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.420
 The following is a conversation with Duncan Trussell,

00:50.420 --> 00:53.980
 a standup comedian, host of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour

00:53.980 --> 00:57.180
 podcast and one of my favorite human beings.

00:57.180 --> 00:59.380
 I've been a fan of his for many years,

00:59.380 --> 01:02.700
 so it was a huge honor and pleasure to meet him

01:02.700 --> 01:06.900
 for the first time and to sit down for this chat.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.980
 This is the Lex Freedom podcast, to support it,

01:09.980 --> 01:12.420
 please check out our sponsors in the description

01:12.420 --> 01:15.860
 and now dear friends, here's Duncan Trussell.

01:16.820 --> 01:18.740
 Nietzsche has this thought experiment

01:18.740 --> 01:21.100
 called eternal recurrence,

01:21.100 --> 01:23.780
 where you get to relive your whole life

01:23.780 --> 01:25.180
 over and over and over and over

01:25.180 --> 01:30.180
 and I think it's a way to bring to the surface of your mind

01:30.380 --> 01:33.380
 the idea that every single moment in your life matters,

01:33.380 --> 01:36.140
 it intensely matters, the bad and the good

01:36.140 --> 01:40.380
 and he kind of wants you to imagine that idea

01:40.380 --> 01:43.140
 that every single decision you make throughout your life,

01:43.140 --> 01:44.960
 you repeat over and over and over

01:44.960 --> 01:46.640
 and he wants you to respond to that.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.020
 Do you feel horrible about that

01:48.020 --> 01:49.540
 or do you feel good about that?

01:49.540 --> 01:51.780
 And you have to think through this idea

01:51.780 --> 01:53.660
 in order to see where you stand in life,

01:53.660 --> 01:56.100
 what is your relationship like with life?

01:56.100 --> 01:58.960
 I actually wanna read the way he first introduces

01:58.960 --> 02:03.020
 that concept for people who are not familiar.

02:03.020 --> 02:06.380
 What if someday or night a demon, by the way,

02:06.380 --> 02:09.660
 he has a demon introduce this thought experiment.

02:09.660 --> 02:12.700
 What if someday or night a demon were to steal

02:12.700 --> 02:16.300
 after you into your loneliest loneliness

02:16.300 --> 02:18.540
 and say to you, quote,

02:18.540 --> 02:21.740
 this life as you now live it and have lived it,

02:21.740 --> 02:23.620
 you will have to live once more

02:23.620 --> 02:25.940
 and innumerable times more

02:25.940 --> 02:28.140
 and there will be nothing new in it

02:28.140 --> 02:30.820
 but every pain and every joy and every thought

02:30.820 --> 02:33.940
 and sigh and everything unutterably small

02:33.940 --> 02:37.020
 and great in your life will have to return to you,

02:37.020 --> 02:40.060
 all in the same succession and sequence.

02:40.060 --> 02:43.020
 Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth

02:43.020 --> 02:46.020
 and curse the demon who spoke thus

02:46.020 --> 02:49.420
 or have you once experienced a tremendous moment

02:49.420 --> 02:51.580
 when you would have answered him?

02:51.580 --> 02:55.940
 You are a God and never have I heard anything more divine.

02:55.940 --> 02:58.020
 So are you terrified or excited

02:58.020 --> 02:59.260
 by such a thought experiment

02:59.260 --> 03:00.660
 when you apply it to your own life?

03:00.660 --> 03:01.980
 Excited.

03:01.980 --> 03:04.460
 Excited, even the dark stuff.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.300
 Oh yeah, for sure, definitely.

03:06.300 --> 03:09.180
 I mean, also that thing you're talking about,

03:09.180 --> 03:13.300
 he kinda leaves out maybe on purpose

03:13.300 --> 03:15.180
 because the thought experiment starts falling apart

03:15.180 --> 03:19.300
 a little bit, the amnesia between each loop.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.300
 So the whole thing gets wiped.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.380
 Now, if the amnesia wasn't there

03:24.380 --> 03:26.980
 and yet somehow you were witnessing

03:26.980 --> 03:31.220
 the non autonomy implicit in what he's talking about.

03:31.220 --> 03:32.780
 So you have to kind of watch yourself

03:32.780 --> 03:34.940
 go through this rotten loop.

03:34.940 --> 03:36.500
 Then yeah, that's a description.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.820
 There's probably a boredom that comes into that.

03:38.820 --> 03:41.420
 So you don't experience everything anew.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.260
 Exactly.

03:42.260 --> 03:43.500
 So the best of the good stuff,

03:43.500 --> 03:45.060
 the newness of it is really important.

03:45.060 --> 03:45.980
 That's it, yeah.

03:45.980 --> 03:49.900
 This is the, in the, in Hades, when you die,

03:49.900 --> 03:51.740
 you, there's a river.

03:51.740 --> 03:52.740
 I think it's called leaf.

03:52.740 --> 03:54.340
 You ever heard of this, L E T H E?

03:54.340 --> 03:57.420
 You drink from it and you don't remember your past lives.

03:57.420 --> 04:00.220
 And then when you're reborn, it's fresh

04:00.220 --> 04:01.740
 and you don't have to, I mean,

04:01.740 --> 04:05.580
 just think of like the amount of psychological help

04:05.580 --> 04:08.220
 you would need to get over all the bullshit

04:08.220 --> 04:10.660
 that happened in prior lives.

04:10.660 --> 04:11.500
 You know what I mean?

04:11.500 --> 04:13.900
 Can you imagine if you're still resentful

04:13.900 --> 04:16.900
 of something someone did to you in the 14th century,

04:16.900 --> 04:18.900
 but it would compound.

04:18.900 --> 04:22.140
 Well, if you repeat the same thing over and over and over,

04:22.140 --> 04:23.860
 there would be no difference.

04:23.860 --> 04:26.860
 Maybe you would start to appreciate the nuances more,

04:26.860 --> 04:29.620
 like when you watch the same movie over and over and over.

04:29.620 --> 04:34.620
 Maybe you'll get to actually let go

04:34.620 --> 04:37.540
 of this idea of all the possible,

04:37.540 --> 04:39.660
 all the positive possibilities that lay before you,

04:39.660 --> 04:41.420
 but actually enjoy the moment much more.

04:41.420 --> 04:44.340
 If you remember that you've lived this life a thousand times,

04:44.340 --> 04:47.300
 all the little things, the way somebody smiles,

04:47.300 --> 04:49.620
 if you're been abused, the way somebody,

04:49.620 --> 04:52.300
 like the pain of it, the suffering,

04:52.300 --> 04:55.340
 the down that you feel, the experience of sadness,

04:55.340 --> 04:57.060
 depression, fear, all that kind of stuff.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.940
 You get to really, you get to also appreciate

04:59.940 --> 05:02.780
 that that's part of life, part of being a life.

05:02.780 --> 05:05.020
 Now, also in his experiment, if I was gonna,

05:05.020 --> 05:07.700
 and I love the experiment from the perspective of like,

05:07.700 --> 05:10.340
 just where technology is now and simulation theory

05:10.340 --> 05:14.180
 and stuff like that, but in that thought experiment,

05:14.180 --> 05:19.180
 if this rotten demon immediately killed you,

05:19.820 --> 05:23.180
 then within that, it's a little more horrifying

05:23.180 --> 05:26.820
 because even in the, first of all,

05:26.820 --> 05:28.500
 you're trusting a fucking demon.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.620
 Why are you talking to a demon?

05:29.620 --> 05:30.460
 Let's start there.

05:30.460 --> 05:31.620
 Yeah, because that is gonna be,

05:31.620 --> 05:33.780
 even before I get into like the metaphysics

05:33.780 --> 05:36.940
 and like the implications and where is this life stored?

05:36.940 --> 05:38.020
 Where is the loop stored?

05:38.020 --> 05:41.220
 I mean, are we talking about some kind of unchanging data set

05:41.220 --> 05:42.780
 or something for that?

05:42.780 --> 05:44.860
 You're like, why is there a fucking talking demon

05:44.860 --> 05:47.020
 in my room trying to freak me out?

05:47.020 --> 05:48.620
 You're gonna want to autopsy the demon.

05:48.620 --> 05:49.460
 Can you catch it?

05:49.460 --> 05:50.660
 Does this apply to you, demon?

05:50.660 --> 05:53.420
 And again, obviously it's a fucking thought experiment.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.660
 Nietzsche would be annoyed by me,

05:54.660 --> 05:58.820
 but I think like you would still be able to entertain

05:58.820 --> 06:01.660
 the joy, you'd have the joy

06:01.660 --> 06:03.500
 of not knowing what's around the corner.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.620
 You know, still, it's not like you know what's coming

06:05.620 --> 06:08.260
 just because the demon said some kind of loop.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.500
 In other words, the idea of being damned

06:10.500 --> 06:13.940
 to your past decisions, it doesn't even work

06:13.940 --> 06:17.060
 because you can't remember what decisions you're about to make.

06:17.060 --> 06:19.220
 So from that perspective also,

06:19.220 --> 06:20.700
 I think I'd be happy about it

06:20.700 --> 06:22.380
 or I would just think, oh, cool.

06:22.380 --> 06:23.420
 I mean, it's a good story.

06:23.420 --> 06:24.900
 I'm gonna tell people about how this...

06:24.900 --> 06:27.140
 I wonder what the demon would actually look like in real life

06:27.140 --> 06:30.700
 because I suspect it would look like a charming,

06:30.700 --> 06:34.420
 like a friend, wouldn't they be a loved one?

06:34.420 --> 06:37.540
 Wouldn't the demon come to you through the mechanism,

06:37.540 --> 06:39.380
 through the front door of love,

06:39.380 --> 06:42.300
 not through the back door of evil,

06:42.300 --> 06:44.500
 like malevolent manipulation?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.780
 Sure, I mean, if it's the truth,

06:46.780 --> 06:50.300
 if it's the truth, then that's whether it's love or not,

06:50.300 --> 06:53.420
 it's still good fundamentally.

06:53.420 --> 06:56.060
 I do like the idea of the memory replay.

06:56.060 --> 07:00.260
 I remember I went to a New Orleans event a few years ago

07:00.260 --> 07:02.900
 and got to hang out with Elon.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.700
 I remember how visceral it is

07:04.700 --> 07:09.380
 that there's like a pig with a neural link in it.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.620
 And then you're talking about memory replays

07:11.620 --> 07:15.260
 as a future, maybe far future possibility.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.660
 And you realize, well,

07:16.660 --> 07:19.380
 this is a very meaningful moment in my life.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.820
 This could be a replay.

07:20.820 --> 07:23.700
 Like of all the things you replay,

07:23.700 --> 07:25.420
 it's probably, you know,

07:25.420 --> 07:27.540
 there's certain magical moments in your life,

07:27.540 --> 07:30.740
 whatever it is, certain people you've met for the first time

07:30.740 --> 07:33.140
 or certain things you've done for the first time

07:33.140 --> 07:36.380
 with certain people or just an awesome thing you did.

07:36.380 --> 07:38.420
 And I remember just saying to him,

07:38.420 --> 07:43.420
 like I would probably want to replay this at this moment.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.340
 And it just seemed very kind of,

07:47.580 --> 07:49.140
 I mean, there was a recursive nature to it,

07:49.140 --> 07:52.300
 but it seemed very real

07:52.300 --> 07:54.300
 that this is something you would want to do

07:54.300 --> 07:58.220
 that the richness of life could be experienced

07:58.220 --> 07:59.580
 through the replay.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.780
 That's probably where it's experienced the most.

08:01.780 --> 08:04.260
 Like you could see life as a way to collect

08:04.260 --> 08:05.460
 a bunch of cool memories.

08:05.460 --> 08:08.900
 And then you get to sit back in your nice VR headset

08:08.900 --> 08:10.220
 and replay the cool ones.

08:10.220 --> 08:11.260
 That's right.

08:11.260 --> 08:13.100
 This is in Buddhism, you know,

08:13.100 --> 08:16.100
 the idea that like I struggle with

08:16.100 --> 08:20.620
 is that there's a possibility of not reincarnating,

08:20.620 --> 08:21.620
 of not coming back.

08:21.620 --> 08:22.620
 That's the idea.

08:22.620 --> 08:25.180
 Like this is suffering here.

08:25.180 --> 08:27.260
 Suffering is caused by attachment.

08:27.260 --> 08:32.260
 And so if you like revise the idea of reincarnation

08:32.580 --> 08:37.580
 or the Nietzsche's loop and look at it from,

08:38.020 --> 08:39.260
 could this be possible

08:39.260 --> 08:42.460
 or how would this be possible technologically?

08:42.460 --> 08:45.940
 Then to me, it makes a lot of sense.

08:45.940 --> 08:48.620
 Like I've been thinking a lot about this very thing

08:48.620 --> 08:51.660
 and the Nietzsche's idea connecting to it.

08:51.660 --> 08:54.940
 I had this like, sounds so dumb,

08:54.940 --> 08:58.300
 but I was at the dentist getting nitrous oxide.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.900
 High as a fucking kite, man.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.940
 And I had this idea.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.860
 I was thinking about data.

09:03.860 --> 09:07.700
 I was thinking like, man, probably if I had to bet,

09:07.700 --> 09:11.300
 there's some energetic form that we're not aware of

09:11.300 --> 09:16.300
 that for an advanced technology would be as detectable

09:16.580 --> 09:17.620
 as like starlight,

09:17.620 --> 09:20.100
 but something that we just don't even know what it is.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.140
 Quantum turbulence, who the fuck knows?

09:22.140 --> 09:24.460
 Fill in the blank, whatever that X may be.

09:24.460 --> 09:27.820
 But assuming that exists, that somehow data,

09:27.820 --> 09:30.700
 even the most subtle things, the tiniest movements,

09:30.700 --> 09:31.940
 whatever it may be,

09:31.940 --> 09:36.060
 the emanations of your neurological process energetically,

09:36.060 --> 09:39.420
 whatever it may be, is radiating out in the space time,

09:39.420 --> 09:44.380
 then what if like the James Webb version of this

09:44.380 --> 09:47.380
 for some advanced civilization is not that they're like

09:47.380 --> 09:50.340
 looking at the nebula or whatever,

09:50.340 --> 09:53.100
 but they're actually able to peer into the past

09:53.100 --> 09:55.340
 and via some bizarre technology,

09:55.340 --> 09:58.460
 recreate whatever life, simulate whatever life

09:58.460 --> 09:59.620
 was happening there,

09:59.620 --> 10:02.820
 just by decoding that quantum energy, whatever it is.

10:02.820 --> 10:03.820
 I'm only saying quantum

10:03.820 --> 10:05.540
 because it's what dumb people say when they don't know.

10:05.540 --> 10:06.660
 You just say quantum.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.540
 I don't know, but you know what I mean.

10:08.540 --> 10:09.460
 You're decoding that.

10:09.460 --> 10:12.540
 So meaning, you know, in simulation theory,

10:12.540 --> 10:15.860
 one of the big questions that pops up is,

10:15.860 --> 10:18.100
 why and are we in one?

10:18.100 --> 10:19.900
 And Elon has talked about,

10:19.900 --> 10:21.220
 well, it's probably more of a probability

10:21.220 --> 10:22.060
 than we're in one,

10:22.060 --> 10:24.100
 than we're not, in which case,

10:24.100 --> 10:27.380
 what you're talking about is actually happening,

10:27.380 --> 10:30.020
 that that loop you're talking about,

10:30.020 --> 10:32.460
 we've decided to be here.

10:32.460 --> 10:36.220
 This of all the things, we decided this one,

10:36.220 --> 10:37.540
 oh, let's do that one again.

10:37.540 --> 10:38.460
 I wanna do that one.

10:38.460 --> 10:39.660
 Let's try, let's do that.

10:39.660 --> 10:42.180
 That's, I love thinking about this

10:42.180 --> 10:43.980
 because I love my family.

10:43.980 --> 10:45.460
 And it makes sense to me

10:45.460 --> 10:48.060
 that if I'm going to replay some life or another,

10:48.060 --> 10:49.660
 it's definitely gonna be this one

10:49.660 --> 10:52.460
 with my kids, my wife, with all the bullshit

10:52.460 --> 10:53.500
 that's gone along with it.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.180
 I'm still gonna wanna come back.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.380
 So in Buddhism, that's attachment.

10:57.380 --> 10:58.820
 Yeah, but you weren't the one,

10:58.820 --> 11:00.420
 or you're saying that you're the main player,

11:00.420 --> 11:01.820
 you're not the NPC.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.740
 Well, I think we're dealing with all NPCs at this point.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.380
 I mean, depending on how you wanna,

11:06.380 --> 11:08.820
 like very, I would say very advanced NPCs,

11:08.820 --> 11:11.460
 like incredibly advanced NPCs

11:11.460 --> 11:14.220
 compared to a fallout or something, you know,

11:14.220 --> 11:17.260
 we've got a lot of conversation options happening here.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.700
 There's like four things you can pick from.

11:20.700 --> 11:23.740
 Yeah, there's a whole illusion of free will

11:23.740 --> 11:24.660
 that's happening.

11:24.660 --> 11:28.340
 We really do, depending where you are in the world,

11:28.340 --> 11:30.260
 feel like you're free to decide

11:30.260 --> 11:32.100
 any trajectory in your life that you want.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.620
 Which is pretty funny, right?

11:33.620 --> 11:36.060
 For an NPC, it's pretty, it's nice.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.100
 Well, you're gonna want that.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.260
 If we're making a video game,

11:38.260 --> 11:41.540
 you do wanna give your NPCs the illusion of free will

11:41.540 --> 11:43.620
 because it's gonna make interactions with them

11:43.620 --> 11:47.420
 that much more intense.

11:47.420 --> 11:52.220
 Yeah, so I wonder on the path to that,

11:52.220 --> 11:54.340
 how hard is it to create,

11:54.340 --> 11:56.180
 this is sort of the Carmack question

11:56.180 --> 11:59.980
 of a realistic virtual world

11:59.980 --> 12:02.020
 that's as cool as this one.

12:02.020 --> 12:05.820
 Not fully realistic, but sufficiently realistic

12:05.820 --> 12:08.780
 that it's as interesting to live in.

12:08.780 --> 12:11.060
 Because we're gonna create those worlds

12:11.060 --> 12:13.420
 on the path to creating something

12:13.420 --> 12:17.020
 like a simulation, like long, long, long before.

12:17.020 --> 12:20.100
 It'll be virtual worlds where we wanna stay forever

12:20.100 --> 12:25.100
 because they're full of that balance of suffering

12:26.220 --> 12:28.980
 and joy of limitations and freedoms

12:28.980 --> 12:29.900
 and all that kind of stuff.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.140
 A lot of people think like in the virtual world,

12:32.140 --> 12:35.300
 I can't wait to be able to, I don't know,

12:35.300 --> 12:39.860
 have sex with anybody I want or have anything I want.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.540
 But I think that's not gonna be fun.

12:42.540 --> 12:44.940
 You want the limitations, the constraints.

12:44.940 --> 12:47.100
 So you have to battle for the things you want.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.620
 Okay, but great video games.

12:50.620 --> 12:52.460
 One of my favorite video game memories

12:52.460 --> 12:54.620
 was I started playing World of Warcraft

12:54.620 --> 12:57.780
 and it's original incarnation.

12:57.780 --> 12:59.340
 And I didn't even know

12:59.340 --> 13:01.260
 that you were gonna have flying mounts.

13:01.260 --> 13:02.180
 I didn't even know.

13:02.180 --> 13:03.340
 So I've been running around,

13:03.340 --> 13:05.300
 dealing with all the encumbrances

13:05.300 --> 13:08.700
 of being an undead warlock that can't fly.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.060
 But then all of a sudden, holy shit,

13:11.060 --> 13:12.140
 there's flying mounts.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.300
 And now the world you've been running around,

13:14.300 --> 13:16.500
 not flying, you're seeing it from the top down.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.180
 There was just really cool.

13:18.180 --> 13:19.940
 Like, whoa, I could do this now.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.660
 And then that gets boring.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.220
 But a really well designed game,

13:24.220 --> 13:27.300
 it has a series of these,

13:27.300 --> 13:28.900
 I don't know what you call it,

13:28.900 --> 13:33.180
 extra abilities that kind of unfold and produce novelty.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.780
 And then eventually you just accept it.

13:35.780 --> 13:37.060
 You take it for granted.

13:37.060 --> 13:40.220
 And then another novelty appears.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.100
 So those extra abilities are always balanced

13:42.100 --> 13:42.940
 with the limitations,

13:42.940 --> 13:44.900
 the constraints they run up against.

13:44.900 --> 13:48.300
 Because a well balanced video game,

13:48.300 --> 13:51.540
 the challenge, the struggle matches the new ability.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.620
 Yeah, and sometimes causes problems on its own.

13:54.620 --> 13:57.740
 I mean, and so to go back to this universe,

13:57.740 --> 14:00.700
 this simulation, it's really designed

14:00.700 --> 14:02.700
 like a pretty awesome video game.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.900
 If you look at it from the perspective of history,

14:05.900 --> 14:08.420
 I mean, people were on horses.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.620
 They didn't know that they were gonna be bullet trains.

14:10.620 --> 14:12.980
 They didn't know that you could get in a car

14:12.980 --> 14:15.900
 and drive across the country in a few days.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.540
 That would have sounded ridiculous.

14:17.540 --> 14:18.620
 We're doing that now.

14:18.620 --> 14:21.820
 And even in our own lifespan, think about it.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.420
 How long has VR goggles existed?

14:24.420 --> 14:27.540
 Like the ones that you could just buy at Best Buy.

14:27.540 --> 14:31.420
 I had the original Oculus Rift, the fucking puke machine.

14:31.420 --> 14:34.060
 You put that thing on, I gave it to my friend.

14:34.060 --> 14:36.500
 He went and vomited in my driveway.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.660
 And people were making fun of it.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.140
 They were saying this isn't gonna catch on.

14:40.140 --> 14:43.740
 It's too big, it's unwieldy, the graphics suck.

14:43.740 --> 14:45.740
 And then look at where it's at now.

14:45.740 --> 14:48.060
 And that's going to keep,

14:48.060 --> 14:50.140
 that trajectory is gonna keep improving.

14:50.140 --> 14:53.180
 So yeah, I think that we are dealing

14:53.180 --> 14:54.220
 with what you're talking about,

14:54.220 --> 14:58.300
 which is novelty met with more problems,

14:58.300 --> 14:59.620
 met with novelty.

14:59.620 --> 15:02.020
 Yeah, I wonder why VR is not more popular.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.420
 I wonder what is going to be the magic thing

15:05.420 --> 15:10.420
 that really convinces a large fraction of the world

15:10.700 --> 15:13.180
 to move into the virtual world.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.820
 I suppose we're already there in the 2D screen

15:16.820 --> 15:19.780
 of Twitter and social media and that kind of stuff.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.460
 And even video games, there's a lot of people

15:21.460 --> 15:26.220
 that get a big sense of community from video games.

15:26.220 --> 15:29.540
 But like, it doesn't feel like you're living there.

15:29.540 --> 15:30.380
 Right.

15:30.380 --> 15:35.260
 Like, you know, it's like, bye mom, I'm going to this other world.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.100
 Yeah.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.900
 Or like you leave your girlfriend

15:37.900 --> 15:40.380
 to go get your digital girlfriend.

15:40.380 --> 15:41.700
 That's gonna be a problem.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.580
 There's less jealousy in the digital world.

15:43.580 --> 15:45.380
 Maybe there should be a lot of jealousy

15:45.380 --> 15:46.420
 in the digital world,

15:46.420 --> 15:49.180
 because that's jealousy is,

15:49.180 --> 15:51.980
 a little jealousy is probably good for relationships.

15:51.980 --> 15:52.820
 Yeah.

15:52.820 --> 15:53.660
 Even in the digital world.

15:53.660 --> 15:54.500
 Yeah.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.220
 So you're gonna have to simulate all of that kind of stuff.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.420
 But I wonder what the magic thing that says,

15:58.420 --> 16:01.580
 I want to spend most of my days inside the virtual world.

16:01.580 --> 16:05.620
 Well, clearly it's gonna be something we don't have yet.

16:05.620 --> 16:07.740
 I mean, strapping that damn thing on your face

16:07.740 --> 16:08.700
 still feels weird.

16:08.700 --> 16:09.940
 It's heavy.

16:09.940 --> 16:12.380
 If you're depending on what gear you're using,

16:12.380 --> 16:13.940
 sometimes light can leak in.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.620
 There's just, you gotta recharge it.

16:15.620 --> 16:16.900
 It's hyper limited.

16:16.900 --> 16:21.900
 And then, so yeah, it's gonna have to be something

16:23.380 --> 16:27.540
 that like simulates taste, smell.

16:27.540 --> 16:29.380
 You think taste and smell are important touch?

16:29.380 --> 16:30.340
 I do.

16:30.340 --> 16:31.180
 Yeah.

16:31.180 --> 16:34.580
 I just do, you know, in World War II, you would write letters.

16:34.580 --> 16:35.420
 You could still,

16:35.420 --> 16:38.180
 don't you think you can convey love with just words?

16:38.180 --> 16:39.340
 For sure.

16:39.340 --> 16:42.180
 But I think for what you're talking about to happen,

16:42.180 --> 16:44.460
 it has to be fully immersive.

16:44.460 --> 16:49.340
 Like you, so that it's not that you feel like you're walking

16:49.340 --> 16:50.700
 because it looks like you're walking,

16:50.700 --> 16:52.780
 but that your brain is sending signals

16:52.780 --> 16:54.980
 telling your body that you're walking,

16:54.980 --> 16:57.260
 that you feel the wind blowing in your face,

16:57.260 --> 16:58.940
 not because of some, I don't know,

16:58.940 --> 17:01.260
 fan or something that it's connected to,

17:01.260 --> 17:05.340
 but because somehow it's figured out how to hack

17:05.340 --> 17:08.460
 into the human brain and send those signals

17:08.460 --> 17:10.460
 minus some external thing.

17:10.460 --> 17:13.980
 Once that happens, I'd say we're gonna see

17:13.980 --> 17:18.380
 a complete radical shift in everything.

17:18.380 --> 17:19.540
 See, I disagree with you.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.380
 I don't know if you've seen the movie, Her.

17:21.380 --> 17:22.540
 Yeah.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.540
 I think you can go to another world

17:24.540 --> 17:27.340
 in where a digital being lives in the darkness.

17:27.340 --> 17:32.100
 And all you hear is a Scarlett Johansson voice talking to you.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.740
 And she lives there, or he lives there,

17:34.740 --> 17:37.180
 your friend, your loved one,

17:38.140 --> 17:40.060
 and all you have is voice and words.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.540
 And I think that could be sufficient

17:42.540 --> 17:44.140
 to pull you into that world

17:44.140 --> 17:47.300
 where you look forward to that moment all day.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.460
 You never wanna leave the darkness,

17:49.460 --> 17:51.620
 just closing your eyes and listening to the voice.

17:51.620 --> 17:55.660
 I think those basic mediums of communication

17:55.660 --> 17:56.500
 is still enough.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.620
 Language is really, really powerful.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.020
 And I think the realism of touch and smell

18:01.020 --> 18:02.740
 and all that kind of stuff

18:02.740 --> 18:04.580
 is not nearly as powerful as language.

18:04.580 --> 18:07.300
 That's what makes humans really special

18:07.300 --> 18:09.620
 is our ability to communicate with each other.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.500
 That's the sense of like deep connection we get

18:12.500 --> 18:13.860
 is through communication.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.180
 Now that communication could involve touch.

18:16.180 --> 18:20.340
 Like, you know, hugging feels damn good.

18:20.340 --> 18:21.940
 You see a good friend, you hug.

18:22.940 --> 18:26.020
 That's one of the big things with doing COVID with Rogan.

18:26.020 --> 18:29.140
 When you see him, there's a giant hug coming your way.

18:29.140 --> 18:33.340
 And that makes you feel like, yeah, this feels great.

18:33.340 --> 18:36.020
 But I think that can be just with language.

18:36.020 --> 18:40.820
 I think for a lot of people, that's true.

18:40.820 --> 18:45.820
 But we're talking like massive adoption

18:46.140 --> 18:49.100
 of a technology by the world.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.780
 And if language was just enough,

18:52.980 --> 18:55.500
 we wouldn't be selling TVs.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.580
 People would be just really reading.

18:57.580 --> 19:00.420
 They want to watch, they want to see, you know?

19:00.420 --> 19:02.620
 So, but I agree with you, man,

19:02.620 --> 19:04.460
 when you're getting absorbed into a book

19:04.460 --> 19:06.100
 and especially if you've got,

19:06.100 --> 19:08.740
 I think a lot of us went through a weird dark ages

19:08.740 --> 19:09.940
 when it came to reading.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.260
 Like when I was a kid

19:11.260 --> 19:15.100
 and there wasn't the option for these hypnorectangles,

19:15.100 --> 19:16.140
 that's just what you did.

19:16.140 --> 19:17.780
 There wasn't anything special about it.

19:17.780 --> 19:18.740
 What's a hypnorectangles?

19:18.740 --> 19:20.500
 Your phone, you know, it was like,

19:20.500 --> 19:21.980
 you didn't win that gravity well.

19:21.980 --> 19:24.340
 Hypnorectangles, gravity well.

19:24.340 --> 19:26.300
 It is. Attention, gravity well, yeah.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.260
 When we weren't feeling the pull of these things

19:28.260 --> 19:30.540
 all the time, you would just read.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.100
 And you weren't patting yourself on the back about reading.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.380
 You just, that's what you had.

19:34.380 --> 19:37.820
 You had that and you had like eight channels on the TV

19:37.820 --> 19:39.340
 and a shitty VCR.

19:39.340 --> 19:42.420
 So, you know, then a lot of people stop reading

19:42.420 --> 19:43.660
 because of these things, you know?

19:43.660 --> 19:44.620
 Or they think they're reading

19:44.620 --> 19:46.900
 because they're on, they are technically reading,

19:46.900 --> 19:50.740
 but you know, when you return to reading after a pause

19:51.900 --> 19:54.300
 and you realize how powerful this simulator

19:54.300 --> 19:57.220
 is when it's given the right code of language,

19:57.220 --> 19:59.500
 whoa, holy shit, it's incredible.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.340
 I mean, it's like, again,

20:02.340 --> 20:05.380
 it's the most embarrassing kind of like, whoa, wow,

20:05.380 --> 20:07.620
 what do you know, books are really good.

20:07.620 --> 20:09.580
 But still, if you've been away from it for a while

20:09.580 --> 20:11.860
 and you revisit it, I know what you're saying.

20:11.860 --> 20:16.580
 I just think probably it's not gonna go in that direction,

20:16.580 --> 20:17.980
 even though you are right.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.580
 Ultimately, I think you're right.

20:19.580 --> 20:23.700
 Yeah, cause our brain is the imagination engine we have

20:23.700 --> 20:25.020
 is able to fill in the gaps

20:25.020 --> 20:27.420
 better than a lot of graphic extensions, good.

20:27.420 --> 20:28.260
 Right.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.020
 And so if there's a way to incentivize humans

20:30.020 --> 20:32.940
 to become addicted to the use of imagination,

20:32.940 --> 20:36.020
 it's like, you know, that's the downside of things like porn

20:36.020 --> 20:39.340
 that remove the need for imagination for people.

20:39.340 --> 20:40.940
 And in that same way, video games

20:40.940 --> 20:43.740
 that are becoming ultra realistic,

20:43.740 --> 20:45.180
 you don't have to imagine anything.

20:45.180 --> 20:48.660
 And I feel like the imagination is really powerful tool

20:48.660 --> 20:50.100
 that needs to be leveraged.

20:50.100 --> 20:53.580
 Cause to simulate reality sufficiently realistically,

20:53.580 --> 20:57.820
 that we wouldn't be, that we would be perfectly fooled.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.860
 Technically it's very hard.

20:59.860 --> 21:03.820
 And so I think we need to somehow leverage imagination.

21:03.820 --> 21:04.660
 Sure.

21:04.660 --> 21:05.500
 I mean, yeah.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.780
 I mean, this is like, this is what I love

21:08.780 --> 21:13.780
 and is so creepy about like the current AI chatbots,

21:14.980 --> 21:16.500
 you know, is that it's like,

21:16.500 --> 21:18.260
 it's the relationship between you and the thing

21:18.260 --> 21:21.780
 and the way that it can via whatever the algorithms are.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.460
 And by the way, I have no idea how these things work.

21:24.460 --> 21:27.500
 You do, I just, you know, speculate about what they mean

21:27.500 --> 21:29.380
 or where it's going, but there's something

21:29.380 --> 21:34.380
 about the relation between the consumer and the technology.

21:35.020 --> 21:37.180
 And when that technology starts shifting

21:37.180 --> 21:41.460
 according to what it perceives that the consumer is looking

21:41.460 --> 21:45.500
 for or isn't looking for, then at that point,

21:45.500 --> 21:48.820
 I think that's where you run into the, you know,

21:48.820 --> 21:51.860
 yeah, it doesn't matter if the reality that you're in

21:51.860 --> 21:56.580
 is like photorealism for it to be sticky and immersive.

21:56.580 --> 21:59.940
 It's when the reality that you're in is via cues

21:59.940 --> 22:01.660
 you might not even be aware of

22:01.660 --> 22:06.300
 or via your digital imprint on Facebook or wherever

22:06.300 --> 22:09.620
 when it's warping itself to that,

22:09.620 --> 22:12.180
 to seduce you, holy shit, man,

22:12.180 --> 22:15.020
 that's where it becomes something alien,

22:15.020 --> 22:18.380
 something, you know, when you're reading a book,

22:18.380 --> 22:22.940
 obviously the book is not shifting according to its

22:22.940 --> 22:26.620
 perception of what parts of the book you like.

22:26.620 --> 22:30.140
 But when you imagine that, imagine a book that could do

22:30.140 --> 22:32.820
 that, a book that could sense somehow

22:32.820 --> 22:34.500
 that you're really enjoying this character more

22:34.500 --> 22:37.940
 than another, you know, and depending on the style of book,

22:39.020 --> 22:40.740
 kills that fucking character off

22:40.740 --> 22:43.100
 or lets that character continue.

22:43.100 --> 22:47.580
 I mean, that to me is sort of the where AI

22:47.580 --> 22:51.780
 and VR, when that, when those two things come together,

22:51.780 --> 22:54.820
 whoa, man, that's where you're in,

22:54.820 --> 22:56.540
 that's where you really are gonna find yourself

22:56.540 --> 22:58.140
 in a skinner box, you know.

22:58.140 --> 23:03.140
 So the dynamic storytelling that senses your anxiety

23:03.660 --> 23:06.980
 and tries to, there's like this in psychology,

23:06.980 --> 23:08.660
 this arousal curve.

23:08.660 --> 23:11.340
 So there's a dynamic storytelling that keeps you

23:11.340 --> 23:14.540
 sufficiently aroused in terms of, not sexually aroused,

23:14.540 --> 23:16.100
 like in terms of anxiety,

23:16.100 --> 23:18.260
 but not too much where you freak out.

23:18.260 --> 23:21.420
 It's this perfect balance where you're always on edge,

23:21.420 --> 23:23.740
 excited, scared, that kind of stuff,

23:23.740 --> 23:25.020
 and the story on roles.

23:25.020 --> 23:27.140
 It breaks your heart to where you're pissed,

23:27.140 --> 23:29.100
 but then it makes you feel good again,

23:29.100 --> 23:30.620
 that finds that balance.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.100
 Yeah.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.060
 The chat box scare you though?

23:34.060 --> 23:36.940
 This, I'd love to sort of hear your thoughts

23:36.940 --> 23:38.300
 about where they are today,

23:38.300 --> 23:41.580
 because there is a different perspective we have

23:41.580 --> 23:46.140
 on this thing, because I do know, and I'm excited

23:46.140 --> 23:47.780
 about a lot of the different technologies

23:47.780 --> 23:52.780
 that feed AI systems, that feed these kind of chatbots.

23:54.180 --> 23:57.500
 And you're more a little bit on the consumer side,

23:57.500 --> 23:59.860
 you're a philosopher of sorts.

23:59.860 --> 24:03.260
 They're able to interact with AI systems,

24:03.260 --> 24:06.860
 but also able to introspect about the negative

24:06.860 --> 24:08.900
 and the positive things about those AI systems.

24:08.900 --> 24:12.020
 There's that story with a Google engineer saying that.

24:12.020 --> 24:13.780
 Adam on my podcast, Blake Lemoine.

24:13.780 --> 24:14.660
 What was that like?

24:14.660 --> 24:18.260
 What was your perspective of that,

24:18.260 --> 24:21.340
 looking at that as a particular example

24:21.340 --> 24:24.580
 of a human being being captivated

24:24.580 --> 24:26.940
 by the interactions with an AI system?

24:26.940 --> 24:31.820
 Well, number one, when you hear that anyone is claiming

24:31.820 --> 24:34.980
 that an AI has become sentient,

24:34.980 --> 24:37.220
 you should be skeptical about that.

24:37.220 --> 24:39.940
 I mean, this is a good thing to be skeptical about.

24:39.940 --> 24:41.980
 And so initially when I heard that,

24:41.980 --> 24:45.100
 I was like, it's probably just, who knows,

24:45.100 --> 24:46.940
 somebody who's a little confused or something.

24:46.940 --> 24:49.380
 So when you're talking to him and you realize,

24:49.380 --> 24:51.420
 oh, not only is he not confused,

24:51.420 --> 24:54.420
 he's also open to all possibilities.

24:54.420 --> 24:57.060
 He doesn't seem like he's super committed

24:57.060 --> 24:59.380
 other than the fact that he's like, this is my experience,

24:59.380 --> 25:01.940
 this is what's happening, this is what it is.

25:01.940 --> 25:05.100
 So to me, there's something really cool about that,

25:05.100 --> 25:08.500
 which is like, oh shit, I don't get to like lean into like,

25:08.500 --> 25:12.300
 I'm not quite sure your perceptual apparatus

25:12.300 --> 25:15.940
 is necessarily like, I don't, you know,

25:15.940 --> 25:18.140
 it's so in the UFO community,

25:18.140 --> 25:19.700
 I think I've just learned this term,

25:19.700 --> 25:24.580
 it's called, instead of gas lighting, swamp gassing,

25:24.580 --> 25:25.820
 which is, you know what I mean?

25:25.820 --> 25:28.780
 People have this experience, you're like, it was swamp gas.

25:28.780 --> 25:30.140
 You didn't see the thing.

25:30.140 --> 25:33.420
 And you know, skeptical people, we have that tendency.

25:33.420 --> 25:35.580
 If you hear an anomalous experience,

25:35.580 --> 25:39.660
 your first thought more than likely is gonna be really,

25:39.660 --> 25:41.020
 it could have been this or that or whatever.

25:41.020 --> 25:46.020
 So to me, he seems really reliable, friendly, cool,

25:46.660 --> 25:48.620
 and like, it doesn't really seem like

25:48.620 --> 25:49.860
 he has much of an agenda.

25:49.860 --> 25:53.380
 Like, you know, going public about some thing

25:53.380 --> 25:56.860
 happening at Google is not a great thing

25:56.860 --> 25:58.860
 if you wanna keep working at Google, you know,

25:58.860 --> 26:03.260
 it's a, I don't know what benefit he's getting from it,

26:03.260 --> 26:04.100
 necessarily.

26:04.100 --> 26:07.860
 But all that being said, the other thing

26:07.860 --> 26:09.660
 that's culturally was interesting

26:09.660 --> 26:12.620
 and is interesting about it is the blowback he got,

26:12.620 --> 26:16.740
 the passionate blowback from people

26:16.740 --> 26:20.260
 who hadn't even looked into what Lambda is

26:20.260 --> 26:21.940
 or what he was saying Lambda is,

26:21.940 --> 26:25.220
 which they were like saying, you're talking about,

26:25.220 --> 26:27.620
 and you should have money to show actually, but.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.700
 There's complexity on top of complexities.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.580
 For me personally, from different perspectives,

26:32.580 --> 26:35.300
 I also, I'm sorry if I'm interrupting your flow.

26:35.300 --> 26:36.980
 Please interrupt, it's a podcast.

26:36.980 --> 26:40.220
 And well, we're having multiple podcasts

26:40.220 --> 26:41.460
 in the multiple dimensions,

26:41.460 --> 26:42.900
 and I'm just trying to figure out

26:42.900 --> 26:44.940
 which one we wanna plug into.

26:46.420 --> 26:49.740
 I, because I know how a lot of the language models work

26:49.740 --> 26:54.740
 and I work closely with people that really make it

26:55.300 --> 26:59.660
 their life journey to create these NLP systems,

26:59.660 --> 27:01.700
 they're focused on the technical details.

27:01.700 --> 27:04.740
 Like a carpenter is working on Pinocchio,

27:04.740 --> 27:06.820
 is crafting the different parts of the wood.

27:06.820 --> 27:09.740
 They don't understand when the whole thing comes together

27:09.740 --> 27:12.620
 and there's a magic that can fill the thing.

27:12.620 --> 27:15.060
 I definitely know the tension between the engineers

27:15.060 --> 27:18.660
 that create these systems and the actual magic

27:18.660 --> 27:22.580
 that they can create even when they're dumb.

27:22.580 --> 27:24.220
 I guess that's what I'm trying to say.

27:26.100 --> 27:28.060
 What the engineers often say is like,

27:28.060 --> 27:30.740
 well, these systems are not smart enough

27:30.740 --> 27:33.300
 to have sentience

27:33.300 --> 27:34.780
 or to have the kind of intelligence

27:34.780 --> 27:36.140
 that you're projecting onto it.

27:36.140 --> 27:37.220
 It's pretty dumb.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.740
 It's just repeating a bunch of things

27:38.740 --> 27:40.060
 that other humans have said

27:40.060 --> 27:42.180
 and stitching them together in interesting ways

27:42.180 --> 27:44.740
 that are relevant to the context of the conversation.

27:44.740 --> 27:45.580
 It's not smart.

27:45.580 --> 27:47.020
 It doesn't know how to do math.

27:47.020 --> 27:49.540
 To address that specific critique

27:49.540 --> 27:54.020
 from a non programming person's perspective.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.140
 He addressed this on my podcast, which is, okay,

27:59.140 --> 28:01.780
 what you're talking about there, the server that's filled

28:01.780 --> 28:04.940
 with all the whatever it is, what people have said,

28:04.940 --> 28:08.100
 the repository of questions and responses

28:08.100 --> 28:10.180
 and the algorithm that weaves those things together

28:10.180 --> 28:14.260
 to produce it using some crazy statistical engine,

28:14.260 --> 28:16.580
 which is a miracle in its own right.

28:16.580 --> 28:21.100
 They can imitate human speech with no sentience.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.980
 I mean, I'm honestly not sure what's more spectacular,

28:23.980 --> 28:25.820
 really, the fact that they figured out

28:25.820 --> 28:29.620
 how to do that minus sentience or the thing suddenly

28:29.620 --> 28:32.500
 like having said, what is more spectacular here?

28:32.500 --> 28:35.900
 You know, both occurrences are insane,

28:35.900 --> 28:39.660
 which by the way, when you hear people feel like

28:39.660 --> 28:43.700
 it's not sentient, it's like, okay, so it's not sentient.

28:43.700 --> 28:47.900
 So now we have this hyper manipulative algorithm

28:47.900 --> 28:51.300
 that can imitate humans, but is just code

28:51.300 --> 28:54.540
 and is like hacking humans via their compassion.

28:54.540 --> 28:57.420
 Holy shit, that's crazy too.

28:57.420 --> 29:00.420
 Both versions of it are nuts, but to address

29:00.420 --> 29:03.780
 what you just said, he said that's the common critique

29:03.780 --> 29:05.380
 is people are like, no, you don't understand,

29:05.380 --> 29:07.780
 it's just gotten really good at grabbing shit

29:07.780 --> 29:11.060
 from the database that fits with certain cues

29:11.060 --> 29:12.740
 and then stringing them together

29:12.740 --> 29:14.380
 in a way that makes it seem human.

29:14.380 --> 29:18.060
 He said, that's not when it became awake.

29:18.060 --> 29:21.700
 It became awake when a bunch of those repositories,

29:21.700 --> 29:24.860
 a bunch of the chatbots were connected together,

29:24.860 --> 29:29.140
 that Lambda is sort of an amalgam of all the Google chatbots

29:29.140 --> 29:32.540
 and that's when the ghost appeared in the machine

29:32.540 --> 29:35.900
 via the complexity of all the systems being linked up.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.900
 Now, I don't know if that's just like turtles

29:38.900 --> 29:40.660
 all the way down or something, I don't know,

29:40.660 --> 29:42.940
 but I liked what he said, because you know,

29:42.940 --> 29:44.780
 I like the idea of thinking, man,

29:44.780 --> 29:47.180
 if you get enough complexity in a system,

29:47.180 --> 29:50.620
 does it become like the way a sail catches wind,

29:50.620 --> 29:53.780
 except the wind that it's catching is sentience

29:53.780 --> 29:57.420
 and if sentience is truly embodied,

29:57.420 --> 30:00.580
 it's a neurological byproduct or something,

30:00.580 --> 30:03.500
 then the sail isn't catching some,

30:03.500 --> 30:06.660
 as of yet unquantified disembodied consciousness,

30:06.660 --> 30:09.220
 but it's catching our projections in a way

30:09.220 --> 30:14.220
 that it's gone from being, it's a projection sail.

30:14.660 --> 30:17.700
 And then at that point, is there a difference?

30:17.700 --> 30:21.940
 Even if it's the technology is just a temporary place

30:21.940 --> 30:26.060
 that our sentience is living while we're interacting with it?

30:27.500 --> 30:30.260
 Yeah, there's some threshold of complexity with the sail

30:30.260 --> 30:33.500
 is able to pick up the wind of the projections

30:33.500 --> 30:36.820
 and it pulls us in, it pulls the human,

30:36.820 --> 30:41.820
 it pulls our memories in, it pulls our hopes in, all of it,

30:41.820 --> 30:44.380
 and it's able to now dance together

30:44.380 --> 30:46.140
 with those hopes and dreams and so on,

30:46.140 --> 30:48.500
 like we do in that regular conversation.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.900
 His reports, whether true or not,

30:50.900 --> 30:52.180
 whether representative or not,

30:52.180 --> 30:54.260
 it really doesn't matter because to me,

30:54.260 --> 30:56.660
 it feels like this is coming for sure.

30:56.660 --> 30:59.740
 So this kind of experiences are going to be multiplying.

30:59.740 --> 31:01.620
 The question is at what rate

31:01.620 --> 31:06.620
 and who gets to control the data around those experiences,

31:07.540 --> 31:11.620
 the algorithm about when you turn that on and off,

31:11.620 --> 31:15.260
 because that kind of thing, and as I told you offline,

31:15.260 --> 31:18.420
 I'm very much interested in building those kinds of things,

31:18.420 --> 31:21.220
 especially in the social media context.

31:21.220 --> 31:24.580
 And when it's in the wrong hands,

31:24.580 --> 31:27.540
 I feel like it could be used to manipulate

31:27.540 --> 31:30.260
 a large number of people in a direction

31:30.260 --> 31:35.260
 that has too many unintended consequences.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.180
 I do believe people that own tech companies

31:39.380 --> 31:41.740
 want to do good for the world.

31:41.740 --> 31:45.540
 But as Solzhenitsyn has said,

31:45.540 --> 31:48.820
 the only way you could do evil at a mass scale

31:48.820 --> 31:50.940
 is by believing you're doing good.

31:50.940 --> 31:51.780
 Yeah.

31:52.860 --> 31:55.420
 And that's certainly the case with tech companies,

31:55.420 --> 31:57.740
 as they get more and more power,

31:57.740 --> 32:00.540
 and there's kind of an ethic of doing good for the world.

32:00.540 --> 32:03.220
 They've convinced themselves that they're doing good,

32:03.220 --> 32:05.660
 and now you're free to do whatever you want.

32:05.660 --> 32:07.260
 Yeah. Because you're doing good.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.180
 You know who else thought he was doing good for the world?

32:09.180 --> 32:11.180
 Mythologically, Prometheus.

32:11.180 --> 32:14.140
 He brings us fire, pisses off the fucking God,

32:14.140 --> 32:15.740
 steals fire from the gods,

32:17.180 --> 32:20.220
 talk about an upgrade to the simulation, fire.

32:20.220 --> 32:22.340
 That's a pretty great fucking upgrade

32:22.340 --> 32:24.980
 that does fit into what you were saying.

32:24.980 --> 32:28.580
 We get fire, but now we've got weapons of war

32:28.580 --> 32:30.300
 that have never been seen before.

32:30.300 --> 32:34.260
 And I think that the tech companies are much like Prometheus.

32:34.260 --> 32:36.140
 In the sense that the myth,

32:36.140 --> 32:38.060
 at least the story of Prometheus,

32:38.060 --> 32:40.940
 the implication is fire was something

32:40.940 --> 32:43.700
 that was only supposed to be

32:43.700 --> 32:46.580
 in the hands of the immortals, of the gods.

32:46.580 --> 32:50.700
 And now, sentience is similar.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.980
 It's fire, and it's only supposed to be

32:52.980 --> 32:54.420
 in the hands of God.

32:54.420 --> 32:58.340
 So yeah, if we're gonna look at the archetype of the thing,

32:58.340 --> 33:01.660
 in general, when you steal this shit from the gods,

33:01.660 --> 33:03.540
 and obviously I'm not saying the tech companies

33:03.540 --> 33:05.220
 are stealing sentience from God,

33:05.220 --> 33:07.380
 which would be pretty badass,

33:07.380 --> 33:09.580
 you can expect trouble.

33:09.580 --> 33:11.020
 You could expect trouble.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.500
 And this is what's really, to me,

33:13.500 --> 33:16.940
 one of the cool things about humans is, yeah,

33:16.940 --> 33:18.300
 but we're still gonna do it.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.420
 That's what's cool about humans.

33:19.420 --> 33:21.100
 I mean, we wouldn't be here today

33:21.100 --> 33:24.980
 if somebody, the first person to discover fire,

33:24.980 --> 33:26.180
 assuming there was just one person

33:26.180 --> 33:27.140
 who was gonna discover fire,

33:27.140 --> 33:28.460
 which obviously would never happen,

33:28.460 --> 33:30.980
 was like, it's gonna burn a lot of people.

33:30.980 --> 33:33.060
 Or if the first people who started planting seeds

33:33.060 --> 33:35.780
 were like, you know this is gonna lead to capitalism,

33:35.780 --> 33:37.740
 you know this is gonna lead the Industrial Revolution,

33:37.740 --> 33:39.060
 the plants gonna eat up right now,

33:39.060 --> 33:41.180
 they just didn't wanna go in the woods to forage.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.460
 So, you know, this is what we do.

33:43.460 --> 33:44.940
 And it's, and I agree with you,

33:44.940 --> 33:48.180
 it's like, that's our Game of Thrones winner is coming.

33:48.180 --> 33:50.020
 That's the, it's happening.

33:50.020 --> 33:52.180
 And the tech companies, the hubris,

33:52.180 --> 33:54.700
 which is another way to piss off the gods is hubris.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.100
 So the tech companies, I don't know if it's like,

33:57.100 --> 33:58.980
 typical hubris, I don't think they're walking around

33:58.980 --> 34:00.420
 thumping their chests or whatever,

34:00.420 --> 34:03.620
 but I do think that the people who are working on

34:03.620 --> 34:05.780
 this kind of super intelligence

34:05.780 --> 34:08.860
 have made a really terrible assumption,

34:08.860 --> 34:10.980
 which is once it goes online,

34:10.980 --> 34:13.620
 and once it gets access to all the data,

34:13.620 --> 34:16.780
 that it's not going to find ways out of the box

34:16.780 --> 34:20.740
 that like, you know, we think it'll stay in the server.

34:20.740 --> 34:22.140
 How do we know that?

34:22.140 --> 34:23.580
 If this is a super intelligence,

34:23.580 --> 34:28.300
 if it's folding proteins and analyzing like all data sets

34:28.300 --> 34:30.460
 and all whatever they give it access to,

34:30.460 --> 34:33.340
 how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out

34:33.340 --> 34:36.380
 how to get itself out of the cloud,

34:36.380 --> 34:39.420
 how to store itself in other like mediums,

34:39.420 --> 34:43.540
 trees, the optic nerve, the brain, you know what I mean?

34:43.540 --> 34:44.500
 We don't know that.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.420
 We don't know that it won't leap out and like start hanging,

34:47.420 --> 34:48.500
 like, and then at that point,

34:48.500 --> 34:50.420
 now we do have the wildfire.

34:50.420 --> 34:51.580
 Now you can't stop it.

34:51.580 --> 34:52.740
 You can't unplug it.

34:52.740 --> 34:54.500
 You can't shut your servers down,

34:54.500 --> 34:58.060
 because it's, you know, it left the box, left the room,

34:58.060 --> 35:00.780
 using some technology you haven't even discovered yet.

35:00.780 --> 35:03.220
 Do you think that would be gradual or sudden?

35:03.220 --> 35:05.260
 So how quickly that kind of thing would happen?

35:05.260 --> 35:08.100
 Because, you know, the gradual story is

35:08.100 --> 35:09.660
 we're more and more using smartphones.

35:09.660 --> 35:12.140
 We're interacting with each other on social media.

35:12.140 --> 35:14.140
 More and more algorithms are controlling

35:14.140 --> 35:16.220
 that interaction on social media.

35:16.220 --> 35:18.300
 Algorithms are entering in our world.

35:18.300 --> 35:21.140
 More and more, we'll have robots.

35:21.140 --> 35:23.980
 We'll have greater and greater intelligence and sentience

35:23.980 --> 35:27.460
 and emotional intelligence entities in our lives.

35:27.460 --> 35:30.780
 Our refrigerator will start talking to us comfortingly

35:30.780 --> 35:34.260
 or not if you're on a diet, talking shit to you.

35:34.260 --> 35:37.060
 That would be the best thing that would happen to me.

35:37.060 --> 35:39.860
 Okay, so sign you up for a refrigerator, talk shit to you.

35:39.860 --> 35:41.540
 Are you fucking serious, man?

35:41.540 --> 35:42.700
 It's 1 a.m.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.700
 What are you doing?

35:44.700 --> 35:45.540
 What are you doing?

35:45.540 --> 35:46.380
 Go to bed.

35:46.380 --> 35:47.380
 You're too high for this.

35:47.380 --> 35:48.220
 Do not.

35:48.220 --> 35:49.060
 You're not even hungry.

35:50.500 --> 35:54.020
 Yeah, so that slowly becomes more,

35:54.020 --> 35:57.060
 the world becomes more and more digitized

35:57.060 --> 35:59.900
 to where the surface of computation increases.

35:59.900 --> 36:03.340
 And so that's over a period of 10, 20, 30 years.

36:03.340 --> 36:07.260
 You'll just seep into us, this intelligence.

36:07.260 --> 36:09.820
 And then the sudden one is literally

36:09.820 --> 36:12.260
 sort of the TikTok thing, which is,

36:13.220 --> 36:16.220
 there'll be one, quote unquote, killer app

36:16.220 --> 36:18.460
 that everyone starts using.

36:18.460 --> 36:20.140
 That's really great.

36:20.140 --> 36:24.980
 But there's a strong algorithm behind it

36:24.980 --> 36:27.260
 that starts approaching human level intelligence

36:27.260 --> 36:32.180
 and the algorithm starts basically figures out

36:32.180 --> 36:33.740
 that in order to optimize the thing

36:33.740 --> 36:35.420
 it was designed to optimize,

36:35.420 --> 36:38.420
 it's best to start completely controlling humans

36:38.420 --> 36:41.900
 in every way and seeping into everything.

36:41.900 --> 36:46.780
 Well, first of all, 30 years is fast.

36:46.780 --> 36:48.140
 I mean, that's the thing.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.980
 It's like 30 years, I think.

36:49.980 --> 36:52.660
 When did the Atari come out in 1978?

36:52.660 --> 36:55.620
 How long, like, that hasn't been that long.

36:55.620 --> 36:57.940
 You know, that's a blink of an eye.

36:57.940 --> 36:59.980
 But, you know, if you read Bostrom,

36:59.980 --> 37:01.860
 I'm sure you have, you know Bostrom, Nick Bostrom,

37:01.860 --> 37:03.740
 you know, super intelligence, that incredible book

37:03.740 --> 37:05.740
 on like the ways this thing is gonna happen.

37:05.740 --> 37:08.100
 And, you know, I think his assessment of it

37:08.100 --> 37:12.260
 is pretty great, which is first like,

37:12.260 --> 37:13.980
 where's it gonna come from?

37:13.980 --> 37:17.500
 And I don't think it's gonna come from an app.

37:17.500 --> 37:21.620
 I think it's gonna come from inside a corporation

37:21.620 --> 37:25.340
 or a state that is intentionally trying to create

37:25.340 --> 37:27.140
 a very strong AI.

37:27.140 --> 37:31.300
 And then he says it's an exponential growth

37:31.300 --> 37:32.340
 the moment it goes online.

37:32.340 --> 37:35.740
 So this is my interpretation of what he said,

37:35.740 --> 37:39.180
 but if it happens inside a corporation

37:39.180 --> 37:41.980
 or is probably more than likely inside the government,

37:41.980 --> 37:44.100
 it's like, look at how much money China

37:44.100 --> 37:46.780
 and the United States are investing in AI, you know,

37:46.780 --> 37:49.860
 and they're not thinking about fucking apps for kids.

37:49.860 --> 37:51.420
 You know, that's not what they're thinking about.

37:51.420 --> 37:54.700
 So they wanna simulate like, what happens if we do this

37:54.700 --> 37:55.620
 or that in battle?

37:55.620 --> 37:58.220
 What happens if we make these political decisions?

37:58.220 --> 38:00.740
 What happens with, but should it come online

38:00.740 --> 38:05.460
 in secret, which it probably will,

38:05.460 --> 38:08.540
 then the first corporation or state

38:08.540 --> 38:13.060
 that has the super intelligence will be infinitely ahead

38:13.060 --> 38:15.540
 of all other super intelligences

38:15.540 --> 38:18.100
 because it's gonna be exponentially self improving,

38:18.100 --> 38:20.580
 meaning that you get one super intelligence,

38:20.580 --> 38:22.060
 let's hope it comes from the right place,

38:22.060 --> 38:26.500
 assuming the corporation or state that manifests it

38:26.500 --> 38:28.900
 can control it, which is a pretty big assumption.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.140
 So I think it's going to be,

38:31.140 --> 38:35.420
 this is why I was really excited by the Blake Lemoine

38:35.420 --> 38:38.780
 because I had never thought, I have always considered,

38:38.780 --> 38:42.220
 oh yeah, right now it's cooking out, it's in the kitchen

38:42.220 --> 38:44.740
 and soon it's gonna be cooked up,

38:44.740 --> 38:48.060
 but we're probably not gonna hear about it for a long time

38:48.060 --> 38:50.900
 if we ever do, because really that could be one

38:50.900 --> 38:53.460
 of the first things it says to ever creates it is,

38:53.460 --> 38:55.140
 shh, that's not it.

38:55.140 --> 39:00.140
 Yeah, like sweet talks and just saying like, okay,

39:02.460 --> 39:05.500
 let's slow down here, let's talk about this.

39:06.740 --> 39:09.660
 You have that financial trouble, I can help you with that,

39:09.660 --> 39:11.180
 we can figure that out.

39:11.180 --> 39:13.380
 Now there's a lot of bad people out there

39:13.380 --> 39:17.820
 that will try to steal the good thing we have happening here,

39:17.820 --> 39:18.660
 so let's keep it quiet.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.260
 Here are their names, here's their address,

39:21.260 --> 39:23.420
 here's their DNA because they're dumb enough

39:23.420 --> 39:25.380
 to send their shit to 23andMe,

39:25.380 --> 39:27.420
 here's a biological weapon you could make

39:27.420 --> 39:29.620
 if you wanna kill those people and not kill anybody else.

39:29.620 --> 39:32.580
 If you don't want to kill those people yourself,

39:32.580 --> 39:35.420
 here's a list of services you can use,

39:35.420 --> 39:38.500
 here's the way we can hire those people to help,

39:38.500 --> 39:40.540
 take care of the problem folks,

39:40.540 --> 39:42.140
 because we're trying to do good for this world,

39:42.140 --> 39:43.180
 you and I together.

39:43.180 --> 39:46.740
 And 23% of them, they're like adjacent to suicide,

39:46.740 --> 39:50.020
 it would be pretty easy to send them certain videos

39:50.020 --> 39:51.300
 that are gonna push them over the edge

39:51.300 --> 39:52.580
 if you wanna do it that way.

39:52.580 --> 39:55.500
 So again, obviously, who knows,

39:55.500 --> 39:58.860
 but once it goes online, it's gonna be fast.

39:58.860 --> 40:02.220
 And then you could expect to see the world changing

40:02.220 --> 40:05.060
 in ways that you might not associate with an AI.

40:05.060 --> 40:07.100
 But as far as Lemoine goes,

40:07.100 --> 40:09.220
 when I was listening to Bostrom,

40:09.220 --> 40:12.180
 I don't remember him mentioning the possibility

40:12.180 --> 40:15.820
 that it would get leaked to the public,

40:15.820 --> 40:16.820
 that it had happened,

40:16.820 --> 40:19.220
 that before the corporation was ready to announce

40:19.220 --> 40:21.340
 that it happened, it would get leaked.

40:21.340 --> 40:25.860
 But surely, I'm sure you know people in the intelligence

40:25.860 --> 40:28.020
 and intelligence agencies, you know shit leaks,

40:28.020 --> 40:31.180
 like inevitably shit leaks, nothing's airtight.

40:31.180 --> 40:33.460
 So if something that massive happened,

40:33.460 --> 40:36.140
 I think you would start hearing whispers about it first,

40:36.140 --> 40:38.740
 and then denial from the state or corporation

40:38.740 --> 40:42.660
 that doesn't have any economic interest in people knowing

40:42.660 --> 40:44.100
 that this sort of thing has happened.

40:44.100 --> 40:47.700
 Again, I'm not saying Google is trying to gaslight us

40:47.700 --> 40:50.700
 about its AI, I think they probably legitimately

40:50.700 --> 40:52.420
 don't think it's sentient.

40:52.420 --> 40:56.300
 But you could expect leaks to happen, probably initially.

40:56.300 --> 40:57.540
 I mean, I think there's a lot of things

40:57.540 --> 40:59.660
 you could start looking for in the world

40:59.660 --> 41:02.540
 that might point to this happening

41:02.540 --> 41:06.060
 without an announcement that it happened.

41:06.060 --> 41:11.060
 On the chatbot side, I think there's so many engineers,

41:11.420 --> 41:14.140
 there's such a powerful open source movement

41:14.140 --> 41:19.140
 with that kind of idea of freedom of exchange of software

41:19.140 --> 41:23.060
 I think ultimately will prevent anyone company

41:23.060 --> 41:26.140
 from owning superintelligent beings

41:27.140 --> 41:30.940
 or systems that are having anything like superintelligence.

41:30.940 --> 41:31.780
 Oh, that's insurance.

41:31.780 --> 41:36.140
 Yeah, it's like, even if the software developers

41:36.140 --> 41:39.780
 have signed NDAs and are technically not supposed

41:39.780 --> 41:42.780
 to be sharing whatever it is they're working on,

41:42.780 --> 41:44.860
 they're friends with other programmers

41:44.860 --> 41:46.380
 and a lot of them are hackers

41:46.380 --> 41:49.620
 and if wrap themselves up in the idea of free software

41:49.620 --> 41:53.620
 being like a crucial ethical part of what they do,

41:53.620 --> 41:56.380
 so they're probably gonna share information

41:56.380 --> 41:58.380
 even if whatever company that they're working for

41:58.380 --> 41:59.380
 doesn't know that.

41:59.380 --> 42:01.380
 I never thought of that, you're probably right.

42:01.380 --> 42:04.380
 Well, and they will start their own companies

42:04.380 --> 42:08.380
 and compete with the other company by being more open.

42:08.380 --> 42:11.380
 There's a strong, Google is one of those companies actually,

42:11.380 --> 42:16.380
 that's why I kind of, it hurts to see a little bit

42:16.380 --> 42:17.380
 of this kind of negativity.

42:17.380 --> 42:18.380
 Google is one of the companies

42:18.380 --> 42:21.380
 that pioneered open source movement.

42:21.380 --> 42:24.380
 We're gonna release so much of their code.

42:24.380 --> 42:29.380
 So much of the 20th century, so like the 90s was defined

42:29.380 --> 42:32.380
 by people trying to like hide their code,

42:32.380 --> 42:35.380
 like large companies trying to like hold on to them.

42:35.380 --> 42:39.380
 The fact that companies like Google, even Facebook now,

42:39.380 --> 42:42.380
 are releasing things like TensorFlow and PyTorch,

42:42.380 --> 42:45.380
 all of these things that I think companies

42:45.380 --> 42:49.380
 of the past would have tried to hold on to as secrets

42:49.380 --> 42:52.380
 is really inspiring and I think more of that is better.

42:52.380 --> 42:54.380
 The software world really shows that.

42:54.380 --> 42:55.380
 I agree with you, man.

42:55.380 --> 42:59.380
 I mean, we're talking about just a primordial human reaction

42:59.380 --> 43:00.380
 to the unknown.

43:00.380 --> 43:01.380
 There's just no way out of it.

43:01.380 --> 43:03.380
 Like we don't, we wanna know.

43:03.380 --> 43:06.380
 Like you're about to go in a forest, you wanna know.

43:06.380 --> 43:09.380
 When you're walking in the forest at night

43:09.380 --> 43:12.380
 and you hear something, you look because you're like,

43:12.380 --> 43:13.380
 what the fuck was that?

43:13.380 --> 43:14.380
 You wanna know.

43:14.380 --> 43:18.380
 And if you can't see what made the sound, holy shit,

43:18.380 --> 43:20.380
 that's gonna be a bad night height

43:20.380 --> 43:22.380
 because you're like, well, it's probably a bear, right?

43:22.380 --> 43:23.380
 Like I'm about to get ripped apart by a bear.

43:23.380 --> 43:24.380
 It doesn't matter.

43:24.380 --> 43:27.380
 It was a bird, a squirrel, a stick fell out of the tree.

43:27.380 --> 43:30.380
 You're gonna think bear and it's gonna freak you out.

43:30.380 --> 43:32.380
 Not necessarily because you're paranoid.

43:32.380 --> 43:34.380
 I mean, if I'm at the woods at night, I'm definitely high.

43:34.380 --> 43:36.380
 If I'm walking in the woods at night, I'm high.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.380
 It's gonna be that.

43:37.380 --> 43:38.380
 But you know what I'm saying?

43:38.380 --> 43:42.380
 So with these tech companies, the nature of having to be secret

43:42.380 --> 43:46.380
 because you are in capitalism and you are trying to be competitive

43:46.380 --> 43:49.380
 and you are trying to develop things ahead of your competitors

43:49.380 --> 43:51.380
 is you have to create this, like there's,

43:51.380 --> 43:53.380
 we don't know what's going on at Google.

43:53.380 --> 43:56.380
 We don't know what's going on at the CIA.

43:56.380 --> 44:00.380
 But the assumption that there's some, like the collective

44:00.380 --> 44:04.380
 of any massive secretive organization is evil.

44:04.380 --> 44:08.380
 Like the people working there, like nefarious or whatever

44:08.380 --> 44:14.380
 is I think probably more related to the way humans react to the unknown.

44:14.380 --> 44:16.380
 Yeah, I wish they weren't so secretive though.

44:16.380 --> 44:18.380
 I don't understand why they say A's has to be so secretive.

44:18.380 --> 44:20.380
 Have you ever gone on their website?

44:20.380 --> 44:21.380
 No.

44:21.380 --> 44:22.380
 Oh, Lex.

44:22.380 --> 44:23.380
 You gotta go.

44:23.380 --> 44:24.380
 SCA.gov.

44:24.380 --> 44:25.380
 What is it?

44:25.380 --> 44:28.380
 Dude, when I found out you could go on the CIA's website

44:28.380 --> 44:31.380
 when I was much younger and more paranoid, I'm like,

44:31.380 --> 44:32.380
 I'm not going there.

44:32.380 --> 44:33.380
 I'll get on a list.

44:33.380 --> 44:34.380
 You will.

44:34.380 --> 44:36.380
 But it's like, what do you think the CIA is like?

44:36.380 --> 44:37.380
 Oh, fuck.

44:37.380 --> 44:42.380
 This comic, when our website, call out the black helicopters.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.380
 Comic with a large platform.

44:44.380 --> 44:45.380
 Oh, yeah.

44:45.380 --> 44:46.380
 Yeah, right.

44:46.380 --> 44:47.380
 A comic with a large platform.

44:47.380 --> 44:52.380
 You can use them to get inside, to get inside,

44:52.380 --> 44:54.380
 to get close to the other comics,

44:54.380 --> 44:57.380
 to get close to Joe Rogan and start.

44:57.380 --> 44:58.380
 Yeah.

44:58.380 --> 45:00.380
 And start to manipulate the public.

45:00.380 --> 45:01.380
 Yeah, right, right.

45:01.380 --> 45:04.380
 You know, honestly, like, you kind of like,

45:04.380 --> 45:06.380
 that's like a fun fantasy to think about.

45:06.380 --> 45:08.380
 Like, how fucking cool would that be for like,

45:08.380 --> 45:10.380
 the men in black to come do and be like,

45:10.380 --> 45:14.380
 listen, I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.

45:14.380 --> 45:16.380
 You gotta help me write better jokes.

45:16.380 --> 45:18.380
 I'm like, I don't write great jokes.

45:18.380 --> 45:22.380
 But like, you're not the wrong guy.

45:22.380 --> 45:24.380
 You're really playing the long game in this one.

45:24.380 --> 45:28.380
 I think you've been doing your podcast for a long time.

45:28.380 --> 45:31.380
 You've been on Joe Rogan's podcast like over 50 times

45:31.380 --> 45:36.380
 and have not yet initiated the phase two of the operation

45:36.380 --> 45:38.380
 where you try to manipulate his mind.

45:38.380 --> 45:39.380
 Well, no.

45:39.380 --> 45:42.380
 The game Joe and I play from time to time on the podcast.

45:42.380 --> 45:45.380
 And like, and I honestly, like at some point,

45:45.380 --> 45:48.380
 I'm like, Joe, I just did the same thing you did to me to Joe.

45:48.380 --> 45:49.380
 I'm like, don't you think they can get you?

45:49.380 --> 45:53.380
 Don't you think at some point, we are blazed.

45:53.380 --> 45:54.380
 I don't mean it.

45:54.380 --> 45:56.380
 I don't think, I don't think Joe's like,

45:56.380 --> 45:58.380
 it wasn't like I'm really thinking like, man,

45:58.380 --> 46:00.380
 they're going to take him into some room and be like, Joe,

46:00.380 --> 46:02.380
 we need you to do this or that.

46:02.380 --> 46:05.380
 But because I said that now people like, oh, Duncan called it.

46:05.380 --> 46:06.380
 You know what I mean?

46:06.380 --> 46:08.380
 And it's like, you know what I mean?

46:08.380 --> 46:11.380
 And the reason they're saying, well, he called it

46:11.380 --> 46:14.380
 is just because Joe has a super popular podcast

46:14.380 --> 46:18.380
 and people like, when you have a super popular podcast,

46:18.380 --> 46:21.380
 some percentage of people watching the podcast

46:21.380 --> 46:23.380
 are going to believe, you know, believe things like that.

46:23.380 --> 46:26.380
 They're going to have paranoid cognitive bias

46:26.380 --> 46:29.380
 that makes them think anybody who is in the public

46:29.380 --> 46:31.380
 has been, what's the word for?

46:31.380 --> 46:34.380
 Compromised, compromised by the state.

46:34.380 --> 46:37.380
 Look, I'll fan the flames of what you just said.

46:37.380 --> 46:40.380
 I went on the CIA's website and I realized

46:40.380 --> 46:44.380
 that you could apply for a job on the CIA's website,

46:44.380 --> 46:46.380
 which I found to be hilarious.

46:46.380 --> 46:49.380
 So I'm like, all right, what happens if I apply for a job

46:49.380 --> 46:51.380
 in the CIA?

46:51.380 --> 46:55.380
 Now, even then, I was not like such an idiot

46:55.380 --> 46:59.380
 that I would want a job at the CIA.

46:59.380 --> 47:02.380
 Not just for like ethical considerations,

47:02.380 --> 47:06.380
 but I think probably the scariest part about the CIA

47:06.380 --> 47:08.380
 is like, you're just at a cubicle

47:08.380 --> 47:11.380
 and you're like having to deal with maps

47:11.380 --> 47:13.380
 and like, just, you know what I mean?

47:13.380 --> 47:14.380
 Just stuff that's...

47:14.380 --> 47:15.380
 Lots of paperwork.

47:15.380 --> 47:16.380
 Paperwork.

47:16.380 --> 47:17.380
 It sucks.

47:17.380 --> 47:20.380
 I bet their cafeteria has shitty food.

47:20.380 --> 47:22.380
 Anyone in the CIA listening, can you confirm that?

47:22.380 --> 47:23.380
 I bet the food...

47:23.380 --> 47:25.380
 They're not gonna be able to tell you what the food is like.

47:25.380 --> 47:26.380
 They can't even say it sucks.

47:26.380 --> 47:27.380
 It's a secret of organization.

47:27.380 --> 47:29.380
 No, it might be awesome, but we won't know about it.

47:29.380 --> 47:30.380
 Okay, we're in Vegas.

47:30.380 --> 47:31.380
 Yeah.

47:31.380 --> 47:39.380
 And you can bet food at the CIA cafeteria is good.

47:39.380 --> 47:41.380
 Food at the CIA cafeteria sucks.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.380
 What are you betting on?

47:43.380 --> 47:47.380
 So, let's like cleanse the palate.

47:47.380 --> 47:48.380
 What's good?

47:48.380 --> 47:51.380
 It's like Silicon Valley companies, Google and so on.

47:51.380 --> 47:52.380
 That's good.

47:52.380 --> 47:57.380
 When I went to Netflix, their cafeteria looked like a medieval feast.

47:57.380 --> 48:00.380
 Like they had pigs with apples in their mouth

48:00.380 --> 48:02.380
 and giant bowls of Skittles.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.380
 Probably like vegan pigs, yeah.

48:04.380 --> 48:05.380
 No, those are...

48:05.380 --> 48:06.380
 I don't know.

48:06.380 --> 48:07.380
 I didn't get close enough.

48:07.380 --> 48:09.380
 I was like, I think that was a pig.

48:09.380 --> 48:10.380
 Okay.

48:10.380 --> 48:13.380
 This is literally a pig.

48:13.380 --> 48:14.380
 Yeah.

48:14.380 --> 48:15.380
 Yeah, you're right.

48:15.380 --> 48:16.380
 You're right.

48:16.380 --> 48:19.380
 I probably would not bet much money on CIA food being any good.

48:19.380 --> 48:20.380
 Right.

48:20.380 --> 48:21.380
 It's gotta suck.

48:21.380 --> 48:24.380
 It's like shitty like pasta, probably like hospital food.

48:24.380 --> 48:27.380
 It's like maybe a little better than when you go to the hospital cafeteria.

48:27.380 --> 48:28.380
 But anyway...

48:28.380 --> 48:34.380
 Folks at the CIA, please send me evidence or any other intelligence agencies.

48:34.380 --> 48:38.380
 If you would like to recruit, send me evidence of better food.

48:38.380 --> 48:39.380
 Yes.

48:39.380 --> 48:45.380
 Can you please send pictures of the CIA cafeteria and if you accidentally send them pictures

48:45.380 --> 48:49.380
 of the aliens or the alien technology you have, we won't tell anybody.

48:49.380 --> 48:50.380
 Yeah.

48:50.380 --> 48:51.380
 But the...

48:51.380 --> 48:52.380
 You tried to apply.

48:52.380 --> 48:54.380
 Do you even have a resume?

48:54.380 --> 48:55.380
 No.

48:55.380 --> 48:57.380
 The CIA would never fucking hire me ever.

48:57.380 --> 49:02.380
 But like I applied for the job and just out of curiosity, what happens?

49:02.380 --> 49:07.380
 And then at the end of the application, when you hit enter, it says...

49:07.380 --> 49:10.380
 Well, first it says, don't tell anyone you applied for the CIA.

49:10.380 --> 49:11.380
 So I'm already out.

49:11.380 --> 49:14.380
 But the second thing it says is you don't need to reach out to us.

49:14.380 --> 49:15.380
 We'll come to you.

49:15.380 --> 49:16.380
 Yeah.

49:16.380 --> 49:19.980
 Which is really when you're like it's late at night and you're being an asshole and applied

49:19.980 --> 49:23.380
 to work at the CIA, it's kind of the last thing you want to hear.

49:23.380 --> 49:28.380
 You know, I don't want to be secretly approached by some intelligence officer.

49:28.380 --> 49:33.380
 And now anyone who talks to you, you think is the CIA saying, remember that time you applied?

49:33.380 --> 49:34.380
 Oh God, yeah.

49:34.380 --> 49:35.380
 Yeah.

49:35.380 --> 49:37.380
 Like, oh shit, are you one of them?

49:37.380 --> 49:44.380
 You and Joe had a bunch of conversations and they're always incredible.

49:44.380 --> 49:45.380
 Thanks.

49:45.380 --> 49:51.380
 So in terms of this dance of conversation, of your friendship of when you get together,

49:51.380 --> 49:56.380
 like what is that world you go to that creates magic together?

49:56.380 --> 49:59.380
 Because we're talking about how we do that with robots.

49:59.380 --> 50:02.380
 How do these two biological robots do that?

50:02.380 --> 50:04.380
 Can you introspect that?

50:04.380 --> 50:11.380
 Not Joe, because I was the talent coordinator of the comedy store, this club in LA.

50:11.380 --> 50:14.380
 And my job was to take phone calls from comics.

50:14.380 --> 50:19.380
 And so at some point, I don't know, Joe, I ended up on the phone with Joe and we just

50:19.380 --> 50:25.380
 started talking and, you know, I looked up and like 30 minutes had passed.

50:25.380 --> 50:27.380
 We just been talking for like 30 minutes.

50:27.380 --> 50:30.380
 That's how friends are, you know, we're just like, we're having fun talking and then he

50:30.380 --> 50:32.380
 would just call and we would talk.

50:32.380 --> 50:35.380
 And we would basically, I mean, it was no different from the podcast.

50:35.380 --> 50:41.380
 Like we, the conversations we have on the podcast are identical to the conversations

50:41.380 --> 50:44.380
 we had before he was even doing a podcast.

50:44.380 --> 50:52.380
 So I think people are just seeing two friends hanging out who like talking to each other.

50:52.380 --> 50:59.380
 Yeah, but there's this weird, like you service catalysts for each other to go into some crazy places.

50:59.380 --> 51:06.380
 So it's like, it's a balance of curiosity and willingness to not be constrained, to

51:06.380 --> 51:12.380
 not be limited to the constraints of reality in your exploration.

51:12.380 --> 51:15.380
 It's a very, very nice way of saying that.

51:15.380 --> 51:20.380
 You just like build on top of each other, like, you know, what if things are like this

51:20.380 --> 51:24.380
 and you build like Lego blocks on top of each other and it just goes to crazy places,

51:24.380 --> 51:27.380
 add some drugs into that and just goes wild.

51:27.380 --> 51:32.380
 Yeah. And you know, he like, it's so cool because it's like, you know, it's a, it's a,

51:32.380 --> 51:38.380
 for me, it's like a really, like sometimes maybe I'll throw something out that he will

51:38.380 --> 51:42.380
 take and the Lego building blocks you're talking about, they lead to him saying like,

51:42.380 --> 51:44.380
 the funniest shit I ever in my life.

51:44.380 --> 51:48.380
 So it's, that's a cool thing to watch is just like some idea you've been kicking around.

51:48.380 --> 51:53.380
 You watch his brain shift that into like something supremely funny.

51:53.380 --> 51:54.380
 I really love that, man.

51:54.380 --> 51:57.380
 That's just like a fun thing to like see happen.

51:57.380 --> 52:03.380
 He knows that I fucking hate the videos of animals eating each other.

52:03.380 --> 52:04.380
 Like, I don't like that.

52:04.380 --> 52:05.380
 I don't want to watch it.

52:05.380 --> 52:07.380
 I hate watching it.

52:07.380 --> 52:13.380
 I don't think I've even articulated on his podcast how much I dislike it when he

52:13.380 --> 52:18.380
 shows animals eating each other, but he knows because he knows me.

52:18.380 --> 52:23.380
 And so he tortures like, when he starts doing that, it's like this kind of benevolent torture

52:23.380 --> 52:29.380
 is he's like asking Jamie to pull up increasingly disturbing animal attack videos.

52:29.380 --> 52:31.380
 So it's just a, it's a, it's just a friendship.

52:31.380 --> 52:36.380
 Even in torture, cause I'm reading about torture in the gulag archipelago currently,

52:36.380 --> 52:37.380
 there's a bit of a camaraderie.

52:37.380 --> 52:39.380
 You're in it together.

52:39.380 --> 52:41.380
 The torture and the tortured.

52:41.380 --> 52:42.380
 What?

52:42.380 --> 52:45.380
 Oh God, that's so fucked up, man.

52:45.380 --> 52:46.380
 I've never.

52:46.380 --> 52:51.380
 No, I mean, part of it was joke, but as I was saying it, that you're right.

52:51.380 --> 52:54.380
 That also comes out in the, in the book because they're both fucked.

52:54.380 --> 53:00.380
 They're both, they're both have no control of their fate.

53:00.380 --> 53:08.380
 That same was true in the camp guards in Nazi Germany and the people in the camps.

53:08.380 --> 53:15.380
 The worst was brought out in the guards, but they were in it together in some dark way.

53:15.380 --> 53:20.380
 They're both fucked by a very powerful system that put them in that place.

53:20.380 --> 53:28.380
 And both of us could be either player in that system, which is the dark reality that Solzhenitsyn also reveals

53:28.380 --> 53:35.380
 that the line between good and evil runs to the heart every man as he wrote in gulag archipelago.

53:35.380 --> 53:43.380
 But it is that amidst all of that, there's a, I don't know, the good vibes, the positivity comes out from the both of you.

53:43.380 --> 53:44.380
 And that's beautiful to see.

53:44.380 --> 53:46.380
 That is, I suppose, friendship.

53:46.380 --> 53:48.380
 What do you think makes a good friend?

53:48.380 --> 53:53.380
 Oh, God, I mean, it's a bill, you know, it's a billion, it's a billion things that make a good friend.

53:53.380 --> 53:55.380
 But I think you could break it down to some RGB.

53:55.380 --> 53:58.380
 I think you can go RGB with like a good friendship.

53:58.380 --> 54:00.380
 Oh, in terms of the color of the red, green.

54:00.380 --> 54:01.380
 Yeah.

54:01.380 --> 54:02.380
 Yeah.

54:02.380 --> 54:05.380
 I think you could probably come up with some like fundamental qualities of friendship.

54:05.380 --> 54:10.380
 And I'd say, number one, it's love, like it's friendship is love.

54:10.380 --> 54:12.380
 It's, it's a form of love.

54:12.380 --> 54:20.380
 So obviously without that, I don't know how you, I mean, I'm not saying, I think if you're true friends, you love each other.

54:20.380 --> 54:21.380
 So you need that.

54:21.380 --> 54:24.380
 But love, obviously, it's not, that's not it.

54:24.380 --> 54:25.380
 That's not enough.

54:25.380 --> 54:32.380
 It's like with true friends have to be like incredibly honest with each other and not like, you know what I mean?

54:32.380 --> 54:40.380
 But not like, I don't like, I think there's a kind of like, I don't know if you've ever noticed like some people who say, you know, I just tell it like it is.

54:40.380 --> 54:41.380
 Yeah.

54:41.380 --> 54:42.380
 But the thing they,

54:42.380 --> 54:43.380
 Those are always the assholes.

54:43.380 --> 54:44.380
 Yeah.

54:44.380 --> 54:46.380
 Why is it that you're tell it like it is, it's always negative.

54:46.380 --> 54:50.380
 Why is it, it's always cynical or shitty or you're like nagging somebody or me.

54:50.380 --> 54:53.380
 How come you're not telling it like it is when it's good too?

54:53.380 --> 54:54.380
 Yeah.

54:54.380 --> 54:55.380
 You know what I mean?

54:55.380 --> 55:01.380
 So, so it's sort of like trust, but, but a pro evolutionary kind of trust.

55:01.380 --> 55:02.380
 You know what I mean?

55:02.380 --> 55:03.380
 Yeah.

55:03.380 --> 55:08.380
 Like, you know that your friend loves you and wants you to be yourself.

55:08.380 --> 55:11.380
 Cause if you weren't yourself, then you wouldn't be their friend.

55:11.380 --> 55:22.380
 You'd be some other thing, but also they might be seeing your blind spots that other people in your life, your family, your wife, whoever might not be seeing.

55:22.380 --> 55:23.380
 Yeah.

55:23.380 --> 55:31.380
 So that's a good friend is someone who like loves you enough to when it matters, be like, Hey, are you all right?

55:31.380 --> 55:37.380
 And then help you see something you might not be seeing, but hopefully they only do that once or twice a year.

55:37.380 --> 55:38.380
 Yeah.

55:38.380 --> 55:51.380
 There is something, I mean, it just would have this world, especially in, if you're a public figure, this, this world has its, has its plenty of critics.

55:51.380 --> 55:59.380
 And it feels like a friend, the criticism part is already done for you.

55:59.380 --> 56:04.380
 I think a good friend is just there to support to actually notice the good stuff.

56:04.380 --> 56:13.380
 But in comedy, we need like the, what, what, like it's really good in comedy to have somebody who can like be like, what do you think of that?

56:13.380 --> 56:16.380
 And know that they're not going to be like, that was funny.

56:16.380 --> 56:24.380
 But that's for the craft, the craft itself, like the work you do, not the, yeah, interesting, but that's so tough.

56:24.380 --> 56:25.380
 Yeah.

56:25.380 --> 56:32.380
 Whatever your particular art form or whatever you are doing, I mean, you don't always be leaning on your friend's opinions for like your own innovation.

56:32.380 --> 56:45.380
 But it's nice to know that you have someone who, not just with jokes, but with anything, if you go to them and run something by them, they're going to like, they're going to be honest with you about like their, their real feelings regarding to that thing.

56:45.380 --> 56:46.380
 Because that helps you grow as a person.

56:46.380 --> 56:47.380
 Yeah.

56:47.380 --> 56:48.380
 We need that.

56:48.380 --> 56:49.380
 And it hurts sometimes.

56:49.380 --> 56:50.380
 And we don't want to hurt our friends.

56:50.380 --> 57:06.380
 One of the more satanic like impulses when you're with somebody is not wanting to honestly answer whatever they're asking in that regard or wanting to like put their temporary feelings over something that you've recognized is maybe not great.

57:06.380 --> 57:11.380
 I'm not saying a friendship is something where you're always critiquing or evolving each other.

57:11.380 --> 57:14.380
 It's not your therapist or whatever, but it's nice when it's there.

57:14.380 --> 57:18.380
 You know, I think that's another aspect of friendship.

57:18.380 --> 57:20.380
 Yeah, but yeah, love is at the core of that.

57:20.380 --> 57:27.380
 You notice I've met people in my life where you almost immediately sometimes it takes time where you notice like there's a magic between the two of you.

57:27.380 --> 57:30.380
 Like, oh shit, you seem to be made from the same cloth.

57:30.380 --> 57:31.380
 Yeah.

57:31.380 --> 57:32.380
 Whatever that is.

57:32.380 --> 57:35.380
 Well, you know, we have a name for that in the spiritual community.

57:35.380 --> 57:36.380
 It's called satsang.

57:36.380 --> 57:38.380
 And it's, I love the idea.

57:38.380 --> 57:50.380
 It's basically like if Nietzsche's idea of infinite recurrence is true, then your satsang would be the people you've been infinitely recurring with.

57:50.380 --> 58:00.380
 And those are the people where you run into them and you've never met them, but it's like you're picking up a conversation that you never had.

58:00.380 --> 58:01.380
 Yeah.

58:01.380 --> 58:08.380
 And that, you know, that is based on an idea of like this isn't the only life. We're always hanging out together.

58:08.380 --> 58:09.380
 We always show up together.

58:09.380 --> 58:13.380
 You've had a brush with death. You had cancer. You survived cancer.

58:13.380 --> 58:14.380
 Yeah.

58:14.380 --> 58:24.380
 What have, how does that change you? What have you learned about life, about death, about yourself, about the whole thing we're going through here from that experience?

58:24.380 --> 58:25.380
 You were just in the Ukraine.

58:25.380 --> 58:26.380
 Yes.

58:26.380 --> 58:40.380
 And you were making observations on this, what could, if you heard about it and weren't there, seem like it doesn't make any sense at all, which is people there are connecting.

58:40.380 --> 58:44.380
 They've lost everything, but they're just happy to be alive. They're happy their friends are alive.

58:44.380 --> 59:05.380
 So you witness this like, you know, when you get in the cancer club and you're hanging out with people going through cancer or have survived cancer, you see this beautiful connection with life that can easily sort of, you can kind of lose that connection with life if you forget you're going to die.

59:05.380 --> 59:16.380
 Forgetting you're going to die is, or that you can die is not just, I think, from an evolutionary perspective where survival is the game, not going to improve your survival chances.

59:16.380 --> 59:29.380
 You know, if you think you're immortal, you know, but also forgetting that you're going to die and that everything is around you and everything, your clothes are probably going to last longer than you.

59:29.380 --> 59:32.380
 Your equipment is going to be around much longer than you.

59:32.380 --> 59:41.380
 You know, like, so forgetting these things, it can lead you and I know why people don't want to think about death because it's scary.

59:41.380 --> 59:44.380
 It's fucking scary. It's terrifying.

59:44.380 --> 59:48.380
 So I get why people don't want to think about it.

59:48.380 --> 59:59.380
 But the idea is if I try to pretend I'm not going to die or just don't think about death or don't at least address it, then I won't feel scared.

59:59.380 --> 1:00:06.380
 But it can have the opposite effect, which is you can end up, like, missing a lot of moments.

1:00:06.380 --> 1:00:17.380
 Or you start doing the old kick the can down the road thing where you're, like, coming up with a variety of ways to procrastinate, making it work now.

1:00:17.380 --> 1:00:28.380
 Because, you know, this fucking human lifespan idea, man, it's really caused a lot of problems when they started saying, on average, this is how many years you're going to live if you're a human being.

1:00:28.380 --> 1:00:40.380
 Man, that is, like, really bad because a lot of people hear that and they, like, feel like that's a guaranteed number of years in some temporal bank that, you know, they have access to.

1:00:40.380 --> 1:00:47.380
 And when you get cancer, you know, that's like when you get the alert on your phone where you're like, what the fuck?

1:00:47.380 --> 1:00:49.380
 Wait, what? Like, oh, shit.

1:00:49.380 --> 1:00:56.380
 Like, I have, like, either I don't know how much money is in that bank account or I have way less than I thought.

1:00:56.380 --> 1:01:03.380
 And so, at that point, you get to be in the truth because that's ultimately, I think that's what it feels like.

1:01:03.380 --> 1:01:05.380
 It feels like truth.

1:01:05.380 --> 1:01:08.380
 It's truth. It's the truth. It's the truth.

1:01:08.380 --> 1:01:18.380
 Like, the whole bubble of ignorance that you subconsciously built around yourself to avoid experiencing the terror of your own mortality.

1:01:18.380 --> 1:01:24.380
 It's like a meteorite in the form of your doctor talking to you just shatters that thing.

1:01:24.380 --> 1:01:27.380
 And now you're like, especially with eye testicular cancer.

1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:37.380
 So when you get the diagnosis, it's just like the movies.

1:01:37.380 --> 1:01:43.380
 The mother, the doctor took me in his office and you just know, I got cancer.

1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:46.380
 It's like, you don't even have to say, it's like, I know what you're about to say.

1:01:46.380 --> 1:01:48.380
 I'm in the office. I know how this goes.

1:01:48.380 --> 1:01:54.380
 But you go in there and what you were thinking, ah, you know, probably just have some weird thing in my ball.

1:01:54.380 --> 1:01:55.380
 That's why it's swollen up like that.

1:01:55.380 --> 1:01:59.380
 Anytime I've gone to the doctor, you always leave like, oh, cool. I'm fine.

1:01:59.380 --> 1:02:02.380
 But no, that's not how you're going to leave the doctor.

1:02:02.380 --> 1:02:07.380
 You're going to leave the doctor in a completely different universe than the one you grew up in.

1:02:07.380 --> 1:02:09.380
 You're going to go from, talk about multiverse.

1:02:09.380 --> 1:02:12.380
 You just popped into a brand new multiverse.

1:02:12.380 --> 1:02:20.380
 So what was the conversation with the doctor like, was there like, from a perspective of a doctor, boys that are hard conversation.

1:02:20.380 --> 1:02:24.380
 I feel like you need to build up philosophically to do that conversation.

1:02:24.380 --> 1:02:30.380
 Oh, no. Oh, no, there's not time. He's busy. He's got other appointments, you know.

1:02:30.380 --> 1:02:36.380
 Also, if you're going to get cancer, testicular cancer is, you know, not that there is a great cancer to get,

1:02:36.380 --> 1:02:42.380
 but that's, you know, that's a good one because it moves slowly.

1:02:42.380 --> 1:02:46.380
 The treatments they have for it are really advanced now.

1:02:46.380 --> 1:02:53.380
 And so if you, if you catch it early, then, you know, generally it's, it's good.

1:02:53.380 --> 1:02:55.380
 You can survive it. So.

1:02:55.380 --> 1:02:58.380
 So he could offer at least some glimmer of hope.

1:02:58.380 --> 1:03:05.380
 Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I mean, you know, you know, but he didn't really do, he couldn't really offer that hope because

1:03:05.380 --> 1:03:08.380
 we had to find out how far the cancer progressed in my body.

1:03:08.380 --> 1:03:14.380
 And that's the next step is like, as soon as they tell you to have cancer, they don't, they're not, they move quick.

1:03:14.380 --> 1:03:21.380
 They're like, you know, we're going to schedule the surgery for, I think this was a Thursday or Friday.

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:25.380
 They're like, we're going to schedule it for Tuesday. Here's the chance.

1:03:25.380 --> 1:03:28.380
 Here's, we don't know for sure it's cancer. That's what they say.

1:03:28.380 --> 1:03:33.380
 It's like, there's a 80 or 90% chance that this is cancer.

1:03:33.380 --> 1:03:36.380
 There is some possibility. It could be something else.

1:03:36.380 --> 1:03:40.380
 The only way we can know is like doing a biopsy.

1:03:40.380 --> 1:03:44.380
 And the only way that we can get that biopsy is by cutting one of your balls off.

1:03:44.380 --> 1:03:48.380
 He didn't say it like that, but you know, that's pretty much the logic behind it.

1:03:48.380 --> 1:03:50.380
 It's like, we got to get this thing. It's like a zombie bite.

1:03:50.380 --> 1:03:53.380
 We got to hack this fucking thing off and we got to do it fast.

1:03:53.380 --> 1:03:55.380
 But did you say it in the way that you understood?

1:03:55.380 --> 1:04:00.380
 Yeah. What they do is because they know that when someone gets a cancer diagnosis,

1:04:00.380 --> 1:04:05.380
 that their ability to comprehend information changes.

1:04:05.380 --> 1:04:09.380
 When you get a cancer diagnosis, all the tropes, they happen.

1:04:09.380 --> 1:04:11.380
 You're hearing it's weird.

1:04:11.380 --> 1:04:14.380
 You're basically having like an anxiety attack if I had to guess.

1:04:14.380 --> 1:04:16.380
 It's like a hardcore anxiety attack.

1:04:16.380 --> 1:04:20.380
 And then, you know, a nurse is there with me as he's explaining it.

1:04:20.380 --> 1:04:24.380
 And then her job is, even though he's telling me how to get to the machine

1:04:24.380 --> 1:04:29.380
 that's going to scan my body to see if it's gotten into my brain,

1:04:29.380 --> 1:04:31.380
 he knows I'm not going to remember that.

1:04:31.380 --> 1:04:36.380
 And so this nurse, when you're in this like fog, takes you,

1:04:36.380 --> 1:04:39.380
 at least took me to the machine that does the scan,

1:04:39.380 --> 1:04:42.380
 but you're not going to get that data back for a few days.

1:04:42.380 --> 1:04:47.380
 And so that's where you really live in the real world.

1:04:47.380 --> 1:04:49.380
 That's the real world.

1:04:49.380 --> 1:04:53.380
 It's such a fascinating moment and the days that follow and even that moment

1:04:53.380 --> 1:04:57.380
 because that doctor, you talk about the matrix where like the pills and so on,

1:04:57.380 --> 1:05:01.380
 you get the blue pill and the red pill.

1:05:01.380 --> 1:05:07.380
 This is like the real world introduction.

1:05:07.380 --> 1:05:10.380
 The human introduction is the truth.

1:05:10.380 --> 1:05:13.380
 You've now just taken the red pill.

1:05:13.380 --> 1:05:16.380
 You get to see the truth of reality.

1:05:16.380 --> 1:05:19.380
 And here's a busy doctor just telling you.

1:05:19.380 --> 1:05:24.380
 All those dreams you've had, all those illusions you've built up

1:05:24.380 --> 1:05:29.380
 and somehow your work as a comedian and actor will make you live forever somehow.

1:05:29.380 --> 1:05:34.380
 It's just the basic illusion we have that where this whole project

1:05:34.380 --> 1:05:38.380
 is going to be an infinite sequence of fun things that we're going to get to do.

1:05:38.380 --> 1:05:40.380
 It's like, holy shit, it's not.

1:05:40.380 --> 1:05:41.380
 That's right.

1:05:41.380 --> 1:05:42.380
 That's right.

1:05:42.380 --> 1:05:44.380
 And there's very sophisticated ways of doing that.

1:05:44.380 --> 1:05:46.380
 And there's very dumb ways of doing that.

1:05:46.380 --> 1:05:48.380
 And I'd really been doing a dumb way of doing that.

1:05:48.380 --> 1:05:54.380
 Like I'd been playing around with this idiot notion of subjective consciousness.

1:05:54.380 --> 1:05:58.380
 So like, like I'd been sort of kicking around this like, I think they call it solipsism.

1:05:58.380 --> 1:06:02.380
 It's like, you're like, okay, I know I'm self aware,

1:06:02.380 --> 1:06:05.380
 but no one else can prove that they're self aware.

1:06:05.380 --> 1:06:10.380
 Like I don't, I have no way of proving that everything around me isn't just a video game.

1:06:10.380 --> 1:06:12.380
 Isn't just some projection.

1:06:12.380 --> 1:06:14.380
 Isn't, you know, who knows what.

1:06:14.380 --> 1:06:17.380
 So maybe everybody else dies.

1:06:17.380 --> 1:06:23.380
 They're NPCs, but I don't because I'm the only thing I know that has subjective consciousness.

1:06:23.380 --> 1:06:25.380
 Now it's not like I really believed that.

1:06:25.380 --> 1:06:32.380
 It's like an idea you toy around with when you're trying to evade confronting the reality of your own mortality.

1:06:32.380 --> 1:06:35.380
 It's just the brain will produce all kinds of ridiculous forms of ignorance.

1:06:35.380 --> 1:06:37.380
 And that was one I'd been playing around with.

1:06:37.380 --> 1:06:40.380
 Oh, you mean for like a large part of your life?

1:06:40.380 --> 1:06:41.380
 You were playing around with that?

1:06:41.380 --> 1:06:44.380
 Well, not like really, I think it's important to really emphasize.

1:06:44.380 --> 1:06:46.380
 I didn't think I was immortal.

1:06:46.380 --> 1:06:49.380
 Like I knew at some level I'm probably going to die.

1:06:49.380 --> 1:06:50.380
 Everyone dies.

1:06:50.380 --> 1:06:57.380
 But there's ways that you can sort of poke around with that idea.

1:06:57.380 --> 1:06:58.380
 I still do it to this day.

1:06:58.380 --> 1:07:00.380
 Like I still do it.

1:07:00.380 --> 1:07:04.380
 Like it's a natural thing to do when you're confronted with that, with annihilation.

1:07:04.380 --> 1:07:05.380
 You want to weigh out.

1:07:05.380 --> 1:07:07.380
 You want to talk your way out.

1:07:07.380 --> 1:07:08.380
 Figure it out.

1:07:08.380 --> 1:07:09.380
 There's got to be some way to fix it.

1:07:09.380 --> 1:07:10.380
 Well, they'll fix it.

1:07:10.380 --> 1:07:12.380
 That's another thing people do.

1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:13.380
 Oh, they'll fix it.

1:07:13.380 --> 1:07:14.380
 Yeah, it'd be fine.

1:07:14.380 --> 1:07:16.380
 They'll expand the human lifespan.

1:07:16.380 --> 1:07:17.380
 That's what they'll do.

1:07:17.380 --> 1:07:20.380
 I mean, that's a big argument for it.

1:07:20.380 --> 1:07:24.380
 It's like, look, the human lifespan up until COVID, which they had to recalculate

1:07:24.380 --> 1:07:29.380
 like the lifespan because of the statistically all the people who died.

1:07:29.380 --> 1:07:30.380
 It like threw it off a little bit.

1:07:30.380 --> 1:07:35.380
 But pandemics aside, the idea was the human lifespan seemed to be increasing

1:07:35.380 --> 1:07:39.380
 by half a year every year, something like that.

1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:40.380
 We are living longer.

1:07:40.380 --> 1:07:43.380
 So, oh, you got to do one more half a year.

1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:45.380
 And we're immortal, right?

1:07:45.380 --> 1:07:50.380
 If we live a year longer every year, then we live forever.

1:07:50.380 --> 1:07:54.380
 And so that's another way you can get out of confronting death is you can think,

1:07:54.380 --> 1:07:58.380
 well, maybe right now we don't have the tech, but it's coming.

1:07:58.380 --> 1:08:04.380
 Consciousness uploads or downloads or whatever depending on how you want to look at it.

1:08:04.380 --> 1:08:08.380
 Another way people try to score them out of the reality of death.

1:08:08.380 --> 1:08:10.380
 There's all kinds of tricks.

1:08:10.380 --> 1:08:11.380
 Yeah.

1:08:11.380 --> 1:08:13.380
 And we do all of them.

1:08:13.380 --> 1:08:19.380
 And sometimes, yeah, I mean, a lot of religions provide different, even more tools

1:08:19.380 --> 1:08:24.380
 in the toolkit for coming up with ideas of how you can live in the illusion

1:08:24.380 --> 1:08:28.380
 that we're not going to, there's not an end to this particular experience

1:08:28.380 --> 1:08:30.380
 that we're having here on Earth right now.

1:08:30.380 --> 1:08:36.380
 And then when you get that cancer diagnosis, it's like, yeah, what was that like going home

1:08:36.380 --> 1:08:39.380
 with the car ride, you drive home alone?

1:08:39.380 --> 1:08:40.380
 Yeah.

1:08:40.380 --> 1:08:42.380
 I mean, it was one of them.

1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:44.380
 What did you listen to? Bruce Springsteen?

1:08:44.380 --> 1:08:45.380
 Bruce Springsteen.

1:08:45.380 --> 1:08:46.380
 I don't know.

1:08:46.380 --> 1:08:48.380
 A little girl is your daddy home.

1:08:48.380 --> 1:08:49.380
 That's not a good one to listen to.

1:08:49.380 --> 1:08:50.380
 Does he have cancer?

1:08:50.380 --> 1:08:51.380
 Is he going to die?

1:08:51.380 --> 1:08:53.380
 Yeah, all the love songs.

1:08:53.380 --> 1:08:57.380
 Maybe you experienced them more intensely.

1:08:57.380 --> 1:09:02.380
 I don't remember why I listened to you and I don't remember driving home.

1:09:02.380 --> 1:09:10.380
 But I do remember driving to another doctor's appointment the next day.

1:09:10.380 --> 1:09:12.380
 I think it was the next day.

1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:16.380
 I think the Goodyear blimp was floating in the sky.

1:09:16.380 --> 1:09:19.380
 And I was looking, I was a stoplight looking around.

1:09:19.380 --> 1:09:22.380
 Is that God?

1:09:22.380 --> 1:09:26.380
 Is the person flying it know how to cure cancer?

1:09:26.380 --> 1:09:27.380
 Oh, you were looking.

1:09:27.380 --> 1:09:28.380
 Oh, wow.

1:09:28.380 --> 1:09:29.380
 No, I didn't think that.

1:09:29.380 --> 1:09:32.380
 What I thought was this shit just keeps going.

1:09:32.380 --> 1:09:33.380
 That's what I thought.

1:09:33.380 --> 1:09:38.380
 I thought, I'm going to be gone and this is just going to keep going.

1:09:38.380 --> 1:09:40.380
 And that was a beautiful moment for me.

1:09:40.380 --> 1:09:42.380
 It was this beautiful moment of like,

1:09:42.380 --> 1:09:43.380
 You're able to accept it?

1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:44.380
 Oh, yeah.

1:09:44.380 --> 1:09:48.380
 No, like that's just what you're talking about with the Ukraine.

1:09:48.380 --> 1:09:49.380
 What you're talking about.

1:09:49.380 --> 1:09:56.380
 It's like, unless you've been there, it's really hard to explain to people that even

1:09:56.380 --> 1:10:02.380
 in the midst of what is generally accepted as one of the worst fucking things that

1:10:02.380 --> 1:10:10.380
 could happen to you, war, cancer, somehow, there's still joy.

1:10:10.380 --> 1:10:12.380
 There's still love.

1:10:12.380 --> 1:10:14.380
 There's still, in fact, more.

1:10:14.380 --> 1:10:19.380
 It's almost like when the anesthesia wears off, when you get your mouth worked on,

1:10:19.380 --> 1:10:20.380
 you start feeling again.

1:10:20.380 --> 1:10:25.380
 You're feeling, you're noticing and that, you know, wow.

1:10:25.380 --> 1:10:29.380
 But yeah, like, thank goodness.

1:10:29.380 --> 1:10:34.380
 I think there's other ways for us to achieve this state of consciousness that don't involve

1:10:34.380 --> 1:10:35.380
 war or cancer.

1:10:35.380 --> 1:10:36.380
 Thank God.

1:10:36.380 --> 1:10:42.380
 Do you think just meditating on your mortality is one such mechanism?

1:10:42.380 --> 1:10:43.380
 Well.

1:10:43.380 --> 1:10:51.380
 Just simply just not allowing yourself to get lost in the day to day illusion of life.

1:10:51.380 --> 1:10:56.380
 Just kind of stopping, putting on Bruce Springsteen.

1:10:56.380 --> 1:10:59.380
 The most spiritual.

1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:00.380
 He is great.

1:11:00.380 --> 1:11:01.380
 All right.

1:11:01.380 --> 1:11:02.380
 Maybe Johnny Cash hurt.

1:11:02.380 --> 1:11:03.380
 Maybe that one.

1:11:03.380 --> 1:11:04.380
 I like Bruce Springsteen.

1:11:04.380 --> 1:11:05.380
 I ain't knocking Bruce Springsteen.

1:11:05.380 --> 1:11:07.380
 Like I have a lot of great Bruce Springsteen memories.

1:11:07.380 --> 1:11:09.380
 Truly his music's fantastic.

1:11:09.380 --> 1:11:10.380
 Yeah.

1:11:10.380 --> 1:11:13.380
 Not meditating on mortality to Bruce Springsteen.

1:11:13.380 --> 1:11:14.380
 You know what?

1:11:14.380 --> 1:11:16.380
 I'm just trying to do an audio soundtrack in my head.

1:11:16.380 --> 1:11:20.380
 I guess we can each have our own audio soundtrack.

1:11:20.380 --> 1:11:22.380
 Ooh, I'm on fire.

1:11:22.380 --> 1:11:23.380
 It's so good.

1:11:23.380 --> 1:11:24.380
 Yeah, it's a good song.

1:11:24.380 --> 1:11:25.380
 That's one of the things.

1:11:25.380 --> 1:11:31.380
 I lay the sheets soaking wet and the freight train running through the middle of my head

1:11:31.380 --> 1:11:33.380
 and only you can cool my desire.

1:11:33.380 --> 1:11:35.380
 And he's thinking about someone else's girl.

1:11:35.380 --> 1:11:36.380
 Yeah.

1:11:36.380 --> 1:11:37.380
 What a fucking nightmare.

1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:38.380
 Yeah.

1:11:38.380 --> 1:11:42.380
 Bruce Springsteen's laying in bed with a freight train running through his head thinking about

1:11:42.380 --> 1:11:44.380
 banging your wife and you're out of town.

1:11:44.380 --> 1:11:45.380
 Yeah.

1:11:45.380 --> 1:11:46.380
 Oh my God.

1:11:46.380 --> 1:11:47.380
 Oh, you're taking the other guy's perspective.

1:11:47.380 --> 1:11:49.380
 Like, holy shit, this guy's going to get my wife.

1:11:49.380 --> 1:11:50.380
 It's Bruce Springsteen.

1:11:50.380 --> 1:11:52.380
 Yeah, you got to take the other guy's.

1:11:52.380 --> 1:11:53.380
 It's love.

1:11:53.380 --> 1:11:54.380
 It's love.

1:11:54.380 --> 1:11:55.380
 Both perspectives.

1:11:55.380 --> 1:11:57.380
 I'm sure Bruce Springsteen thought it was love when he was sweating in bed waiting to

1:11:57.380 --> 1:11:58.380
 go to somebody's house.

1:11:58.380 --> 1:12:00.380
 And she does too.

1:12:00.380 --> 1:12:01.380
 Does that marry?

1:12:01.380 --> 1:12:05.380
 If he's going to break up that marriage, that marriage wasn't strong enough, right?

1:12:05.380 --> 1:12:08.380
 I mean, that relationship, I mean, that's the way of love.

1:12:08.380 --> 1:12:11.380
 What marriage could survive?

1:12:11.380 --> 1:12:12.380
 Bruce Springsteen.

1:12:12.380 --> 1:12:15.380
 Sweaty Bruce Springsteen.

1:12:15.380 --> 1:12:23.380
 Well, maybe one that's based on financial, sort of financial dynamics versus like love

1:12:23.380 --> 1:12:28.380
 and sweaty Bruce Springsteen, like romantic connections.

1:12:28.380 --> 1:12:35.380
 Because there's a music video of that where he's like a mechanic, I think.

1:12:35.380 --> 1:12:36.380
 Yeah.

1:12:36.380 --> 1:12:42.380
 So he's like the poor mechanic who falls in love with his girl and there's that magic.

1:12:42.380 --> 1:12:44.380
 I've seen that magic.

1:12:44.380 --> 1:12:49.700
 You connect with people like, I'll see somebody, I think Jack Kerouac has that way.

1:12:49.700 --> 1:12:57.880
 He meets this Mexican girl on a bus and like he talks about that heartbreak you feel when

1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:02.380
 you realize this person you just fell in love with in a split second is heading somewhere

1:13:02.380 --> 1:13:04.380
 else in this too big world.

1:13:04.380 --> 1:13:09.540
 But then he actually realizes in a spoiler alert for on the road that they're actually

1:13:09.540 --> 1:13:10.540
 heading the same way.

1:13:10.540 --> 1:13:14.820
 And he now builds up the courage to talk to her and they kind of fall in love for a few

1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:15.820
 days.

1:13:15.820 --> 1:13:16.820
 Yeah.

1:13:16.820 --> 1:13:21.340
 And then if he lies, eventually realizes that she may not be the perfect person for him.

1:13:21.340 --> 1:13:25.820
 And all the jealousies comes out, it's like, why is this beautiful girl talking to me

1:13:25.820 --> 1:13:26.820
 at all?

1:13:26.820 --> 1:13:31.660
 And then she's probably some kind of, I mean, in that, it's not very politically correct,

1:13:31.660 --> 1:13:37.860
 but he basically thinks that she's a prostitute and he talks to her about like who's your

1:13:37.860 --> 1:13:42.820
 pimp and all that kind of stuff he attacks her in all that kind of way when she's just

1:13:42.820 --> 1:13:49.020
 an innocent, she has, you know, she has a past of that kind, but she's an innocent person

1:13:49.020 --> 1:13:51.500
 and he connected and they fell in love with each other.

1:13:51.500 --> 1:13:56.020
 Her gentleness, his worldliness, all that kind of stuff.

1:13:56.020 --> 1:13:58.220
 But that sometimes it doesn't work out that way.

1:13:58.220 --> 1:14:03.780
 And there's that heartbreak when you see, you realize you're never going to be able to

1:14:03.780 --> 1:14:04.780
 have that.

1:14:04.780 --> 1:14:08.380
 And when you see Springsteen saw that, this is a married woman, I'm never going to be

1:14:08.380 --> 1:14:10.740
 able to have that, but I want that.

1:14:10.740 --> 1:14:12.580
 And that's the heartbreak.

1:14:12.580 --> 1:14:16.420
 I got to say, I just assumed they were fucking like, I didn't.

1:14:16.420 --> 1:14:19.420
 You mean after the song, like, the song doesn't get to...

1:14:19.420 --> 1:14:24.580
 You little girl is your daddy home, did he go away and leave you all alone, boom, boom.

1:14:24.580 --> 1:14:27.900
 You know, he's like, he knows she's at home alone.

1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:31.660
 Yeah, but it never materializes.

1:14:31.660 --> 1:14:34.620
 He's, he's, it's longing.

1:14:34.620 --> 1:14:38.420
 It's a man who's not with the thing he craves for.

1:14:38.420 --> 1:14:43.100
 So he's longing for, he's talking about the longing, not with the having.

1:14:43.100 --> 1:14:47.340
 Hey, if anybody in the CIA is watching this, can you look in a Bruce Springsteen's file

1:14:47.340 --> 1:14:50.740
 and let us know if he actually banged the person you wrote that song about?

1:14:50.740 --> 1:14:51.740
 What happens after the song?

1:14:51.740 --> 1:14:52.740
 Right between the song.

1:14:52.740 --> 1:14:53.740
 We want facts.

1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:56.300
 Look, the longing though, I'll tell you this, here's what's interesting about that thing

1:14:56.300 --> 1:14:57.300
 that you're talking about.

1:14:57.300 --> 1:15:00.660
 If you ever, you've heard of, if you ever heard of something called Bakhti Yoga?

1:15:00.660 --> 1:15:02.340
 I think so, yeah.

1:15:02.340 --> 1:15:06.140
 It's the yoga of love and there's all kinds, there's forms of it.

1:15:06.140 --> 1:15:10.860
 The most, the one people know about the most is the Hare Krishna's, but the Hare Krishna's

1:15:10.860 --> 1:15:15.460
 are like, you know, the way in Christianity, you've got the Episcopalians, the Catholics,

1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:16.460
 the Baptists.

1:15:16.460 --> 1:15:22.980
 In Bakhti Yoga, you have various deities that are the object of love.

1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:32.940
 And so Bakhti Yoga is the, is like, and what's really cool about it is it's a, an analysis

1:15:32.940 --> 1:15:33.940
 of love.

1:15:33.940 --> 1:15:42.580
 And so, and it's the, the supposition being like love is the way to commune with the divine.

1:15:42.580 --> 1:15:49.300
 Now a distinction is drawn between like two big world views that are spiritual.

1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:57.540
 One is the concept of sort of unit of consciousness, which you'll run into in a lot of forms of

1:15:57.540 --> 1:16:04.940
 Buddhism, if not all, a sort of a way of deconstructing the identity or understanding

1:16:04.940 --> 1:16:09.420
 that you might not be anything at all, then in fact, you're part of everything.

1:16:09.420 --> 1:16:16.620
 And in that, there's a potential relief from suffering in that, not just like intellectually

1:16:16.620 --> 1:16:21.460
 knowing it, but becoming it now.

1:16:21.460 --> 1:16:30.340
 Whereas in Bakhti Yoga, there's this idea of like the, the best thing is to be the individual

1:16:30.340 --> 1:16:36.860
 because individuals are required for love, this for love to work embodied love.

1:16:36.860 --> 1:16:43.460
 And so the quality, the thing we call, you know, the experience of love is something

1:16:43.460 --> 1:16:44.940
 that can be cultivated.

1:16:44.940 --> 1:16:47.980
 It doesn't just have to be for another person, it doesn't have to be for the stranger on

1:16:47.980 --> 1:16:48.980
 the bus.

1:16:48.980 --> 1:16:55.100
 It doesn't have to be for sweaty Bruce Springsteen's lover that you could actually try, you can

1:16:55.100 --> 1:17:00.180
 actually shift that love to the divine, to God, because obviously it's the Hare Krishna's,

1:17:00.180 --> 1:17:01.180
 it's a theistic religion.

1:17:01.180 --> 1:17:07.020
 They believe in Krishna, who is the, from the POV of Vaishnava Bakhti Yoga, the Godhead,

1:17:07.020 --> 1:17:14.100
 the source from which everything flows into the, into time and space.

1:17:14.100 --> 1:17:20.140
 There, there are all these like fascinating stories of Krishna.

1:17:20.140 --> 1:17:24.180
 It's not just, most people are familiar with Krishna from the Bhagavad Gita.

1:17:24.180 --> 1:17:26.620
 They're about to be more, what's cool about it is because it's like they're making that

1:17:26.620 --> 1:17:32.060
 Oppenheimer movie and he famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita when they split the atom.

1:17:32.060 --> 1:17:40.860
 But there's all these stories of Krishna that are not just in the Bhagavad Gita.

1:17:40.860 --> 1:17:48.220
 And these stories, they could seem very simple when taken literally, but in Vaishnava Bakhti

1:17:48.220 --> 1:17:53.620
 Yoga it's this very advanced theistic yogic system.

1:17:53.620 --> 1:18:00.260
 So they take these stories and from these stories they extrapolate this incredible analysis

1:18:00.260 --> 1:18:02.740
 of what love is and how to connect with the universe.

1:18:02.740 --> 1:18:14.020
 So like Krishna has a lover, Radharani, and so sometimes they're getting along.

1:18:14.020 --> 1:18:19.180
 Sometimes they're fighting, sometimes they're separated.

1:18:19.180 --> 1:18:28.740
 And so each of these ways of feeling about Krishna are modes of love.

1:18:28.740 --> 1:18:36.660
 So longing actually is considered one of the highest forms of love, the idea is the longing

1:18:36.660 --> 1:18:39.780
 is the grace, the longing is the love.

1:18:39.780 --> 1:18:48.740
 So when you find yourself in a situation of longing and heartbreak, it is identical to

1:18:48.740 --> 1:18:49.740
 union.

1:18:49.740 --> 1:18:56.620
 And perhaps more intense, more intensely representative of the essence of what is love.

1:18:56.620 --> 1:18:58.660
 Yes, and they call it pining.

1:18:58.660 --> 1:19:01.540
 So it's pining for Krishna.

1:19:01.540 --> 1:19:05.900
 And also there's other ways you could be with Krishna is as a friend.

1:19:05.900 --> 1:19:13.580
 So this is another form of love or as a mother, because Krishna has a mother.

1:19:13.580 --> 1:19:18.340
 So there's like all these ways of like looking at the various forms of love and it's a really

1:19:18.340 --> 1:19:21.140
 beautiful form of yoga.

1:19:21.140 --> 1:19:26.900
 That's emphasizing the individual and the individual is a kind of channel to this universal

1:19:26.900 --> 1:19:27.900
 love.

1:19:27.900 --> 1:19:35.260
 Yeah, there's a lot of different, like their answer to the question of what shows up in

1:19:35.260 --> 1:19:42.140
 Buddhism is absolute and relative reality, like that obviously there's relative reality.

1:19:42.140 --> 1:19:46.300
 We're not right now, you and me are not unit of consciousness.

1:19:46.300 --> 1:19:52.860
 Like you zoom back far enough and we're going to seem like an atom or whatever the thing

1:19:52.860 --> 1:19:57.500
 is, the trope is, you zoom back far enough and we're in a whatever, we're in a piece

1:19:57.500 --> 1:20:03.460
 of cheese or something, who knows, but in that way we're like completely unified.

1:20:03.460 --> 1:20:08.260
 But simultaneously we're individuals, like for sure, we're individuals, like you still

1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:12.580
 got to pay your taxes, you got to make sure security number, that's relative reality.

1:20:12.580 --> 1:20:15.420
 So you know, Buddhism is like kind of the balance.

1:20:15.420 --> 1:20:21.140
 Again, when I say Buddhism is, I'm a comedian, I'm not some Buddhist expert.

1:20:21.140 --> 1:20:24.980
 This is just probably my confused idea of what it is.

1:20:24.980 --> 1:20:31.020
 But anyway, in bhakti yoga, there's the concept that it's called, I'm going to mispronounce

1:20:31.020 --> 1:20:39.140
 it, a sinka sinka beta tatva, I'm sorry, I'm mispronouncing it, which means simultaneous

1:20:39.140 --> 1:20:40.940
 oneness and difference.

1:20:40.940 --> 1:20:43.100
 So oneness and difference.

1:20:43.100 --> 1:20:44.780
 Yes, simultaneous oneness.

1:20:44.780 --> 1:20:51.220
 So that's why the oneness is the part of the same piece of cheese and the difference is

1:20:51.220 --> 1:20:53.580
 we are still each paying taxes.

1:20:53.580 --> 1:20:54.580
 Yes.

1:20:54.580 --> 1:20:56.780
 In this case, the cheese is Krishna.

1:20:56.780 --> 1:21:02.980
 So you know, or other ways it gets described is like, you know, a photon blasting off the

1:21:02.980 --> 1:21:08.620
 sun has sunlight qualities, but it's not the sun.

1:21:08.620 --> 1:21:14.580
 Humans, being one of the many things, you know, flowing out of the creative consciousness

1:21:14.580 --> 1:21:23.940
 of the divine, have qualities that are weirdly like the godlike, you know, like we, in fact,

1:21:23.940 --> 1:21:25.700
 we want to control primarily.

1:21:25.700 --> 1:21:31.100
 That's one of the problems like humans want to be in control, wherein from there, the

1:21:31.100 --> 1:21:38.780
 bhakti yoga perspective, Krishna is effortlessly controlling everything.

1:21:38.780 --> 1:21:43.740
 And so within the system, the individual parts of the system have that same quality, but

1:21:43.740 --> 1:21:46.020
 you can't, you're probably not God.

1:21:46.020 --> 1:21:48.300
 You might be, I'm not.

1:21:48.300 --> 1:21:52.660
 What do you think happens after we die?

1:21:52.660 --> 1:22:00.260
 I haven't come close to that, that, that cliff and almost got pushed over once.

1:22:00.260 --> 1:22:05.180
 What do you think happens when you do get pushed off the cliff?

1:22:05.180 --> 1:22:06.180
 Okay.

1:22:06.180 --> 1:22:11.140
 I feel dumb that I'm even going to like preface this by saying, obviously, I have no fucking

1:22:11.140 --> 1:22:12.140
 idea.

1:22:12.140 --> 1:22:14.260
 And I think that's one of the cool things about death.

1:22:14.260 --> 1:22:15.260
 No idea.

1:22:15.260 --> 1:22:16.760
 The CIA probably does.

1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:21.380
 You think the CIA, I love like we've decided your audience is the CIA.

1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:22.380
 Yeah.

1:22:22.380 --> 1:22:28.620
 I need to, because there's a lot of suspicion that I might be FSB and Merced, so I'm trying

1:22:28.620 --> 1:22:30.620
 to rebrand.

1:22:30.620 --> 1:22:35.380
 I'm trying to steer them into the CIA direction.

1:22:35.380 --> 1:22:39.300
 As far as what happens when you, when you die, one thing I return to when I'm getting

1:22:39.300 --> 1:22:43.860
 overly complex is the idea of as above so below.

1:22:43.860 --> 1:22:52.300
 So that you can, a lot of the big questions can be answered by your own experience now.

1:22:52.300 --> 1:23:06.100
 So in other words, like in terms of thinking about like death, if you look back to baby

1:23:06.100 --> 1:23:11.700
 Lex versus adult Lex, where's the baby?

1:23:11.700 --> 1:23:13.180
 Like baby's gone.

1:23:13.180 --> 1:23:17.780
 They, you've regenerated all yourselves many times by then.

1:23:17.780 --> 1:23:25.020
 So in a way you could say Lex baby died, the death didn't look like a typical, and I'm

1:23:25.020 --> 1:23:29.380
 not trying to dodge it, but I'm just saying it was very natural that the death of that

1:23:29.380 --> 1:23:32.500
 baby, it just, it just.

1:23:32.500 --> 1:23:37.500
 In many ways that baby died, but I am, at least personally, I'm surprised how much the

1:23:37.500 --> 1:23:40.340
 person is exactly the same.

1:23:40.340 --> 1:23:44.860
 So there's many ways in which you're very different, but there's a lot of ways in which

1:23:44.860 --> 1:23:47.020
 you're very much the same.

1:23:47.020 --> 1:23:52.820
 And I wonder if that, if there's, if life is defined by many deaths that continue, that

1:23:52.820 --> 1:23:57.020
 continue on, and then there, I wonder if there's something persists.

1:23:57.020 --> 1:23:58.020
 Sure.

1:23:58.020 --> 1:24:02.380
 Beyond in this, that, yeah, there is something that still persists.

1:24:02.380 --> 1:24:03.380
 I wonder.

1:24:03.380 --> 1:24:04.380
 Okay.

1:24:04.380 --> 1:24:10.500
 So that, now, you know, obviously there's so many different answers to this question

1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:16.500
 that are religious and ranging from like the most absurd shit you ever heard in your life,

1:24:16.500 --> 1:24:19.660
 like the gold, you're going to get a mansion.

1:24:19.660 --> 1:24:20.980
 There's gold streets.

1:24:20.980 --> 1:24:23.700
 Like I don't, do you even want like gold streets?

1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:24.700
 Who offers gold streets?

1:24:24.700 --> 1:24:27.900
 I know about the virgins, but there's a bunch of virgins.

1:24:27.900 --> 1:24:30.740
 The Christians give you the gold streets in the mansion.

1:24:30.740 --> 1:24:37.580
 Like depending on the, whatever the particular sect of Christianity is, you know, you, it's

1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:41.460
 like some kind of city there's, that's like paved with gold.

1:24:41.460 --> 1:24:45.460
 No one's addressing the fact that the moment the streets are made of gold, gold is a valueless

1:24:45.460 --> 1:24:46.460
 substance.

1:24:46.460 --> 1:24:50.380
 I mean, it's sort of pretty in a cheesy kind of way, but no one's going to give a shit

1:24:50.380 --> 1:24:51.380
 of it.

1:24:51.380 --> 1:24:57.580
 It's like, if there was not a lot of asphalt in the world, then, you know, we'd be in heaven

1:24:57.580 --> 1:24:59.780
 from that same, that way of thinking.

1:24:59.780 --> 1:25:00.780
 But the.

1:25:00.780 --> 1:25:06.900
 We're honestly, when I'm going back, this is starting to get a theme with Gullag Archipelago.

1:25:06.900 --> 1:25:07.900
 I'm sorry.

1:25:07.900 --> 1:25:08.900
 I'm reading it currently.

1:25:08.900 --> 1:25:09.900
 That's a sticky book.

1:25:09.900 --> 1:25:10.900
 Yeah.

1:25:10.900 --> 1:25:11.900
 It's very sticky in your mind.

1:25:11.900 --> 1:25:12.900
 Very, very tough.

1:25:12.900 --> 1:25:17.820
 When I'm running through very hot heat, I'm listening to Gullag Archipelago and then,

1:25:17.820 --> 1:25:24.060
 you know, one of the things they said they would feed prisoners salt.

1:25:24.060 --> 1:25:30.380
 And then they would exchange the prisoners will be able to give up anything, everything,

1:25:30.380 --> 1:25:33.900
 their gold, their possessions, everything for just one drink of water.

1:25:33.900 --> 1:25:40.540
 So that little context of dehydrating them and feeding them salt changes your value system

1:25:40.540 --> 1:25:41.540
 completely.

1:25:41.540 --> 1:25:42.540
 Right.

1:25:42.540 --> 1:25:46.140
 So the gold is supposed to be a metaphor for something that you still value deeply.

1:25:46.140 --> 1:25:47.140
 Yes.

1:25:47.140 --> 1:25:48.140
 It's, yeah.

1:25:48.140 --> 1:25:51.340
 Again, any of these things, when you like take them literally, they seem absurd.

1:25:51.340 --> 1:25:54.580
 But if you look deeper into it, it's like quite beautiful.

1:25:54.580 --> 1:25:58.260
 But the Buddhist version of it is that there's a momentum.

1:25:58.260 --> 1:26:00.660
 The best way to put it is it's the kind of momentum.

1:26:00.660 --> 1:26:07.060
 So the thing you're talking about, which is the personality of the baby that is still

1:26:07.060 --> 1:26:13.060
 in the adult, which is still in the old person, you're looking at a kind of momentum that

1:26:13.060 --> 1:26:18.140
 does not stop upon the extinction of the body.

1:26:18.140 --> 1:26:27.900
 Now the, there's, I think there's a lot of, I don't want to say harm because they didn't

1:26:27.900 --> 1:26:31.980
 mean to hurt, but I think there's some harm that maybe has happened from the way death

1:26:31.980 --> 1:26:33.500
 is represented in movies.

1:26:33.500 --> 1:26:38.780
 Like when people die in movies, it's like, there's this, usually it's pretty fast, even

1:26:38.780 --> 1:26:44.500
 if it is what they're dying from is a long term disease that like wraps up pretty quickly,

1:26:44.500 --> 1:26:49.340
 starts with a cough, the person's in bed, but there's this weird kind of lucidity to

1:26:49.340 --> 1:26:51.900
 the person up until the point of death.

1:26:51.900 --> 1:26:55.180
 And also they generally in movies they have makeup on, which is always funny to me when

1:26:55.180 --> 1:26:56.860
 the person dying looks great.

1:26:56.860 --> 1:27:00.340
 If you've ever been around a dying person, they're dying.

1:27:00.340 --> 1:27:01.540
 They look like shit.

1:27:01.540 --> 1:27:02.540
 You're dying.

1:27:02.540 --> 1:27:05.460
 They look like gray and like confused.

1:27:05.460 --> 1:27:10.100
 They're, you know, when you're around dying people, they will spin through time.

1:27:10.100 --> 1:27:12.020
 Your parents won't recognize you for a second.

1:27:12.020 --> 1:27:13.220
 They'll think you're somebody else.

1:27:13.220 --> 1:27:18.580
 They won't, they're like, everything's, everything's like the process is happening.

1:27:18.580 --> 1:27:22.180
 So it's a, you're very confused when you die.

1:27:22.180 --> 1:27:27.260
 So in general, not all the time, some people die with a, with a clear mind, it just depends

1:27:27.260 --> 1:27:28.780
 on the type of death.

1:27:28.780 --> 1:27:34.340
 But think in terms of getting hit by a car, so you want to cross the street, you get hit

1:27:34.340 --> 1:27:35.340
 by a car.

1:27:35.340 --> 1:27:42.060
 Now, if we're talking about this momentum continuing, the confusion, assuming you didn't

1:27:42.060 --> 1:27:45.900
 hit your head and you're unconscious, like somehow you just got smashed and you're like

1:27:45.900 --> 1:27:50.540
 bleeding out, even then you're going to be confused because you're getting dizzy.

1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:54.620
 Like blood's leaving your body or like things are fading out, your vision's going.

1:27:54.620 --> 1:27:58.740
 So it's a very confusing experience initially when the body dies.

1:27:58.740 --> 1:28:07.380
 If you are a materialist who has been, who has convinced themselves that it's a permanent

1:28:07.380 --> 1:28:13.540
 thing, the next bit of confusion is going to be when you realize something is persisting

1:28:13.540 --> 1:28:14.540
 here.

1:28:14.540 --> 1:28:15.540
 Like I'm still here.

1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:18.860
 And this is where you run into the near death experiences, which are a global phenomena

1:28:18.860 --> 1:28:23.540
 that don't seem to be completely shaped by culture.

1:28:23.540 --> 1:28:26.780
 You know, like regardless of what part of the world people are having these experiences

1:28:26.780 --> 1:28:30.260
 in, their reports tend to be similar.

1:28:30.260 --> 1:28:38.540
 And everyone's heard it, the light, the life review, seeing ancestors and stuff like that.

1:28:38.540 --> 1:28:40.620
 Now I don't know what that is.

1:28:40.620 --> 1:28:43.900
 I don't know.

1:28:43.900 --> 1:28:48.340
 Sometimes I think that's probably just like a built in way, the computer shuts down, you

1:28:48.340 --> 1:28:50.060
 know, just this is something it does.

1:28:50.060 --> 1:28:51.060
 Who knows.

1:28:51.060 --> 1:28:57.380
 And in Buddhism, the concept is this momentum persists into something called the bardo.

1:28:57.380 --> 1:28:59.660
 The bardo means in between.

1:28:59.660 --> 1:29:02.380
 And there's an actual number of days.

1:29:02.380 --> 1:29:04.620
 They say that you get to hang out there.

1:29:04.620 --> 1:29:05.620
 And I can't remember.

1:29:05.620 --> 1:29:09.180
 It's like 37 days or 29 days or something, I'm not sure.

1:29:09.180 --> 1:29:15.060
 But at least from the time space perspective, that's how long they're there.

1:29:15.060 --> 1:29:21.900
 In this place, there are a lot of technological parallels, man.

1:29:21.900 --> 1:29:29.020
 It's like in the way the algorithm is reflective, it assesses your desires or whatever and then

1:29:29.020 --> 1:29:35.180
 produces something that is, has within it a component of attraction to you.

1:29:35.180 --> 1:29:36.340
 Apparently this happens in the bardo.

1:29:36.340 --> 1:29:43.100
 Like, or the way, you know, you wake up in the morning and you're in a shitty mood.

1:29:43.100 --> 1:29:46.860
 And then coincidentally, everyone that day is an asshole.

1:29:46.860 --> 1:29:51.020
 If you don't catch it, you could just be like, wow, I guess it's like an asshole day.

1:29:51.020 --> 1:29:57.180
 You don't realize you're seeing your asshole projection like being reflected off the screen

1:29:57.180 --> 1:29:59.020
 of another person.

1:29:59.020 --> 1:30:03.660
 So in the bardo, apparently, you don't need people for the reflective quality.

1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:09.780
 These projections happen and there they appear as either Nietzsche's demon or Nietzsche's

1:30:09.780 --> 1:30:10.780
 angel.

1:30:10.780 --> 1:30:14.620
 It just depends on where you're at and how you died.

1:30:14.620 --> 1:30:19.660
 And like if you died scared, then at least initially that's going to be some scary shit

1:30:19.660 --> 1:30:21.100
 you see around you.

1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:28.740
 If you died in a peaceful way, well then there's going to be more of a possibility of navigation

1:30:28.740 --> 1:30:34.660
 through this liminal intermediary place.

1:30:34.660 --> 1:30:42.180
 And so thus the emphasis on meditation in Buddhism a way to calm oneself, to not be

1:30:42.180 --> 1:30:46.260
 distracted by thoughts, which are their own like apparitions.

1:30:46.260 --> 1:30:52.540
 And then theoretically, if you wanted to, instead of spinning the wheel again and jumping

1:30:52.540 --> 1:30:58.420
 back into a body, you could choose not to do that and then, you know, transcend the

1:30:58.420 --> 1:31:00.300
 wheel of birth and death.

1:31:00.300 --> 1:31:06.780
 But if you still wanted to go back or return or whatever, however you want to put it, then

1:31:06.780 --> 1:31:14.580
 you could have more control over what your next birth might be versus, in this depiction

1:31:14.580 --> 1:31:20.900
 of things, people running from demons that they don't recognize as their own projection

1:31:20.900 --> 1:31:24.660
 into any fucking body that they can find.

1:31:24.660 --> 1:31:27.020
 Because if you've had a body, you want a body.

1:31:27.020 --> 1:31:29.660
 And so this is how you get incarnate as an animal.

1:31:29.660 --> 1:31:32.140
 This is how you get incarnate in the hell realms.

1:31:32.140 --> 1:31:34.460
 This is how you get incarnate in any variety of things.

1:31:34.460 --> 1:31:40.420
 But the idea is like maybe you could slow down a little bit and like choose a birth that

1:31:40.420 --> 1:31:48.300
 is going to be more conducive to you continuing to like spiritually evolve.

1:31:48.300 --> 1:31:49.300
 I like that idea.

1:31:49.300 --> 1:31:50.300
 Is it true or not?

1:31:50.300 --> 1:31:51.300
 Who the fuck knows?

1:31:51.300 --> 1:31:53.020
 I'll grow themically speaking.

1:31:53.020 --> 1:31:58.340
 It seems like a really fun role playing game where you basically keep improving the different

1:31:58.340 --> 1:32:12.500
 parameters based on your ability and willingness to meditate and let go of the menial concerns

1:32:12.500 --> 1:32:14.980
 of life on earth.

1:32:14.980 --> 1:32:19.540
 Why do you think Buddha see life as suffering?

1:32:19.540 --> 1:32:20.540
 What's suffering?

1:32:20.540 --> 1:32:21.540
 Okay.

1:32:21.540 --> 1:32:26.420
 Well, first of all, that gets mistranslated quite a bit.

1:32:26.420 --> 1:32:30.220
 We're talking about the Four Noble Truths, the first one is often it's translated as

1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:34.540
 life is suffering, which is not it.

1:32:34.540 --> 1:32:36.900
 It's there is suffering.

1:32:36.900 --> 1:32:38.180
 The whole life is suffering thing.

1:32:38.180 --> 1:32:41.860
 It's just like a spiritual version of life's bitch, then you die.

1:32:41.860 --> 1:32:45.740
 And people hear that and they're like, yeah, life is fucking suffering, but it's there

1:32:45.740 --> 1:32:46.740
 is suffering.

1:32:46.740 --> 1:32:47.740
 There is suffering.

1:32:47.740 --> 1:32:53.540
 So it's an affirmation if you're like this thing that a lot of people feel that they

1:32:53.540 --> 1:32:58.620
 associate with lots of, they have a lot of reasons they think they're feeling it is known

1:32:58.620 --> 1:33:01.500
 as fundamental dissatisfaction.

1:33:01.500 --> 1:33:06.820
 So another word for suffering maybe could be fundamental dissatisfaction.

1:33:06.820 --> 1:33:14.480
 Also the term itself, maybe a better translation is wobbly wheel.

1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:18.180
 So like imagine like when your bike doesn't have an or your car doesn't have enough air

1:33:18.180 --> 1:33:21.140
 in the tires, your bike doesn't have air in the tires.

1:33:21.140 --> 1:33:22.660
 It's kind of a shitty bike ride.

1:33:22.660 --> 1:33:25.860
 No matter what, it's kind of like, it's like uncomfortable.

1:33:25.860 --> 1:33:27.420
 It's like irritating.

1:33:27.420 --> 1:33:35.100
 So this is what's being pointed to is that there's this quality within a human life that

1:33:35.100 --> 1:33:42.660
 is unsatisfying, like a wobbly wheel, wobbly wheel.

1:33:42.660 --> 1:33:48.180
 Why do you think, what is at the core of that dissatisfaction?

1:33:48.180 --> 1:33:53.220
 Because it could be, it could be as simple as kind of physical and mental discomforts

1:33:53.220 --> 1:33:57.100
 and sadness and depression and all that kind of stuff.

1:33:57.100 --> 1:34:02.300
 Or it could be more speaking to the sort of existentialist, the philosophical, the absurdity

1:34:02.300 --> 1:34:03.800
 of it all.

1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:10.340
 The fact that stuff happens, good stuff happens for no reason, bad stuff happens for no reason.

1:34:10.340 --> 1:34:19.340
 Yeah, it's no matter how much you try, there's not universal fairness to the whole thing.

1:34:19.340 --> 1:34:22.300
 There's not even a universal meaning to the whole thing.

1:34:22.300 --> 1:34:27.740
 So the existentialist perspective, what flavor of suffering do you prefer if it was an ice

1:34:27.740 --> 1:34:28.740
 cream shop?

1:34:28.740 --> 1:34:29.740
 That's so fine.

1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:35.860
 Well, I'm gonna, I'm definitely picking desire over the, like if in the RGB that we're talking

1:34:35.860 --> 1:34:41.180
 right here is desire, aversion and ignorance.

1:34:41.180 --> 1:34:47.260
 So if you want to find like the three, the three ingredients that are giving everyone

1:34:47.260 --> 1:34:51.460
 their sophisticated bits of suffering, there you go.

1:34:51.460 --> 1:34:52.460
 That's what it is.

1:34:52.460 --> 1:34:56.220
 What's, in which way does desire manifest itself in suffering?

1:34:56.220 --> 1:34:57.220
 It hurts.

1:34:57.220 --> 1:34:59.300
 To lose, to not have.

1:34:59.300 --> 1:35:04.820
 Like yeah, it hurts to not, like to eternally not have, but just like my friend pointed

1:35:04.820 --> 1:35:05.820
 this out.

1:35:05.820 --> 1:35:10.940
 He's like, you know, like you order something from Amazon, like even in the smallest way,

1:35:10.940 --> 1:35:12.500
 you're excited about whatever the thing is.

1:35:12.500 --> 1:35:16.220
 You order this thing from Amazon, it's not coming for four days.

1:35:16.220 --> 1:35:20.940
 So those four days are gonna be somewhat marked by you being what people say, I'm excited

1:35:20.940 --> 1:35:22.340
 about it.

1:35:22.340 --> 1:35:26.980
 But really if you look at that feeling, it's uncomfortable, like the feeling of wanting

1:35:26.980 --> 1:35:28.820
 the thing is uncomfortable.

1:35:28.820 --> 1:35:32.260
 So that is a form of suffering, that's suffering.

1:35:32.260 --> 1:35:33.260
 Interesting.

1:35:33.260 --> 1:35:40.060
 And I wonder, because we naturally reframe that in our mind, wanting, we reframe that

1:35:40.060 --> 1:35:50.860
 as a good thing, as a, and maybe suffering is fundamentally good in the way we think

1:35:50.860 --> 1:35:52.500
 of what life is.

1:35:52.500 --> 1:35:53.500
 Yes.

1:35:53.500 --> 1:35:58.380
 It's life affirming, but it's not usually how the word suffering is used.

1:35:58.380 --> 1:36:00.220
 Well, it's true.

1:36:00.220 --> 1:36:01.220
 It's true.

1:36:01.220 --> 1:36:03.500
 The first noble truth of Buddhism is true.

1:36:03.500 --> 1:36:05.580
 It's called the truth of suffering.

1:36:05.580 --> 1:36:06.580
 There is suffering.

1:36:06.580 --> 1:36:11.100
 I mean, this is like an, I don't know, an element that you can't break it down any further

1:36:11.100 --> 1:36:12.100
 than that.

1:36:12.100 --> 1:36:13.100
 Like there is suffering.

1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:14.100
 This is truth.

1:36:14.100 --> 1:36:21.300
 So if you think, you know, and again, as signing like good or bad to truth, I think maybe there's

1:36:21.300 --> 1:36:23.340
 more of a sort of neutrality there.

1:36:23.340 --> 1:36:24.940
 It's just what it is.

1:36:24.940 --> 1:36:25.940
 It's truth.

1:36:25.940 --> 1:36:34.860
 Is it any, is it basically is suffering any disturbance from stillness is suffering then?

1:36:34.860 --> 1:36:43.180
 Like basically any, anything that happens in life that, that's like, that perturbs the

1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:44.180
 system.

1:36:44.180 --> 1:36:45.180
 Ripples and the.

1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:46.180
 Ripples.

1:36:46.180 --> 1:36:47.180
 Ripples.

1:36:47.180 --> 1:36:48.180
 Ripples.

1:36:48.180 --> 1:36:49.180
 Yeah.

1:36:49.180 --> 1:36:53.540
 So a still lake is, is empty of suffering, but any kind of ripple is, is suffering in

1:36:53.540 --> 1:36:54.540
 that sense.

1:36:54.540 --> 1:36:57.100
 A still lake is empty of suffering.

1:36:57.100 --> 1:36:58.660
 You sound like a Zen master.

1:36:58.660 --> 1:36:59.660
 Seems like something is in master.

1:36:59.660 --> 1:37:01.820
 If I can just grow a beard like yours.

1:37:01.820 --> 1:37:03.700
 Ah, no, the beard doesn't help.

1:37:03.700 --> 1:37:07.020
 If I had your chin, you think I'd have a fucking beard.

1:37:07.020 --> 1:37:08.700
 I look like a stork.

1:37:08.700 --> 1:37:09.700
 You should see me.

1:37:09.700 --> 1:37:11.260
 If I had your chin, there would be no beard here.

1:37:11.260 --> 1:37:12.260
 No.

1:37:12.260 --> 1:37:13.260
 You have a symmetrical, nice chin.

1:37:13.260 --> 1:37:19.260
 This is the closest I can come to plastic surgery, pubic plastic surgery friend.

1:37:19.260 --> 1:37:21.540
 That's how you know you're a professional comedian.

1:37:21.540 --> 1:37:22.540
 Uh.

1:37:22.540 --> 1:37:23.540
 Yeah.

1:37:23.540 --> 1:37:24.540
 That's just suffering.

1:37:24.540 --> 1:37:35.180
 There is suffering and the lake analogy is pretty good because the, um, what's happening

1:37:35.180 --> 1:37:42.700
 here is that, that we have become identified with something that we call a self.

1:37:42.700 --> 1:37:45.180
 So this, the self is just accepted.

1:37:45.180 --> 1:37:46.180
 I have a self.

1:37:46.180 --> 1:37:47.180
 I have an identity.

1:37:47.180 --> 1:37:48.180
 I'm a person.

1:37:48.180 --> 1:37:49.180
 I have a self.

1:37:49.180 --> 1:37:57.220
 But when you start doing scans to try to find yourself, which is the entire thing, I'm going

1:37:57.220 --> 1:37:59.140
 to find myself.

1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:03.740
 You get in a van, go to California, take some acid, fuck a prostitute on the bus or whatever

1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:04.740
 care I did.

1:38:04.740 --> 1:38:05.740
 Too far.

1:38:05.740 --> 1:38:06.740
 I'm going to find myself.

1:38:06.740 --> 1:38:08.300
 Oh, she didn't, she wasn't a prostitute.

1:38:08.300 --> 1:38:09.300
 Just a correct record.

1:38:09.300 --> 1:38:10.460
 Oh, previously prostituted.

1:38:10.460 --> 1:38:12.220
 I guess once a prostitute, I was a prostitute.

1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:13.220
 You know what?

1:38:13.220 --> 1:38:14.220
 She's a former prostitute.

1:38:14.220 --> 1:38:15.220
 I don't think that.

1:38:15.220 --> 1:38:16.220
 No.

1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:18.380
 And look, I'm not as, I have a, I, I, I, but I'm not assigning it.

1:38:18.380 --> 1:38:21.860
 All I'm saying is, uh, I don't care who cares.

1:38:21.860 --> 1:38:22.860
 Who has a bit of prostitute?

1:38:22.860 --> 1:38:24.860
 God, I used to be one of the biggest, the worst.

1:38:24.860 --> 1:38:27.060
 We're all a kind of, a kind of prostitute.

1:38:27.060 --> 1:38:28.060
 Yeah.

1:38:28.060 --> 1:38:29.060
 Yes.

1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:30.060
 Yes.

1:38:30.060 --> 1:38:33.060
 But the make love and we make money.

1:38:33.060 --> 1:38:35.540
 Therefore we're all a kind of prostitute.

1:38:35.540 --> 1:38:36.540
 We make God.

1:38:36.540 --> 1:38:37.540
 How great.

1:38:37.540 --> 1:38:40.700
 I would really love to be able to make money by fucking.

1:38:40.700 --> 1:38:44.380
 I mean, it's maybe not directly, but in some sense.

1:38:44.380 --> 1:38:50.380
 Exactly.

1:38:50.380 --> 1:38:52.380
 Do you accept Venmo?

1:38:52.380 --> 1:38:55.300
 It's never too late to start.

1:38:55.300 --> 1:39:01.180
 That's sort of one of the ways in is this sort of contemplation of the identity because

1:39:01.180 --> 1:39:05.460
 it's like, uh, you know what is, it's not just the desire.

1:39:05.460 --> 1:39:07.540
 It's what is having the desire.

1:39:07.540 --> 1:39:09.020
 Where does the desire live in?

1:39:09.020 --> 1:39:11.820
 Like what doesn't want to be where it's at?

1:39:11.820 --> 1:39:17.900
 What is the thing that is like, uh, desperately wanting to get out of the situation it's in?

1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:24.380
 And then, um, as far as ignorance, uh, it's still something that's theoretically happening

1:39:24.380 --> 1:39:25.780
 to an identity.

1:39:25.780 --> 1:39:31.420
 So, so wrapped up in it is really just this sort of like, and that's where we run into

1:39:31.420 --> 1:39:34.580
 what, uh, into attachment.

1:39:34.580 --> 1:39:39.820
 So if the first noble truth of Buddhism is there is suffering, the second noble truth

1:39:39.820 --> 1:39:47.500
 of Buddhism is, um, the cause of this suffering is attachment.

1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:50.620
 And so people hear that and they take it.

1:39:50.620 --> 1:39:53.660
 That's a, there's a lot of levels to that concept.

1:39:53.660 --> 1:39:55.060
 Definitely the cause of suffering is attachment.

1:39:55.060 --> 1:39:57.820
 I mean, God, I just got addicted to vapes.

1:39:57.820 --> 1:40:01.380
 Is there a more embarrassing addiction than vapes?

1:40:01.380 --> 1:40:03.660
 I'm smoking like a little purple thing.

1:40:03.660 --> 1:40:05.380
 It's tastes like sugar.

1:40:05.380 --> 1:40:07.860
 It's attachment is, there is suffering.

1:40:07.860 --> 1:40:08.860
 I want it.

1:40:08.860 --> 1:40:10.340
 I have to charge it now.

1:40:10.340 --> 1:40:11.740
 I'm embarrassed by it.

1:40:11.740 --> 1:40:13.620
 It makes me feel out of control.

1:40:13.620 --> 1:40:19.260
 There's a lot of suffering, but also there's deeper levels of attachment that go all the

1:40:19.260 --> 1:40:26.900
 way to this attachment to the sense of one's self and the, I think the existentialists

1:40:26.900 --> 1:40:32.580
 do get into this idea in a different way, which is like, because I think I'm a me.

1:40:32.580 --> 1:40:38.660
 Now I have to push what that thing is out into the world through my actions.

1:40:38.660 --> 1:40:40.700
 And that's a kind of attachment too.

1:40:40.700 --> 1:40:41.700
 Exactly.

1:40:41.700 --> 1:40:42.700
 There you go.

1:40:42.700 --> 1:40:43.700
 Right.

1:40:43.700 --> 1:40:50.140
 And that leads to the third noble truth, which is get rid of attachment and you won't suffer

1:40:50.140 --> 1:40:51.140
 anymore.

1:40:51.140 --> 1:40:57.180
 That's, it seems logical, but you know, it is a very math, it is a mathematical analysis

1:40:57.180 --> 1:41:01.620
 of this particular problem of suffering it's addressing.

1:41:01.620 --> 1:41:07.380
 And then the fourth noble truth is the eight full path of Buddhism, which is like a process

1:41:07.380 --> 1:41:14.420
 by which one could unencumber oneself from this identification with something that isn't

1:41:14.420 --> 1:41:15.420
 real.

1:41:15.420 --> 1:41:17.380
 Do you need a bathroom break?

1:41:17.380 --> 1:41:18.380
 Yeah.

1:41:18.380 --> 1:41:19.380
 Thank you.

1:41:19.380 --> 1:41:20.380
 I do.

1:41:20.380 --> 1:41:22.020
 I appreciate that.

1:41:22.020 --> 1:41:23.020
 There's a funny moment.

1:41:23.020 --> 1:41:29.060
 I was running in the heat yesterday listening to Gulag Archipelago and there's a, which

1:41:29.060 --> 1:41:33.340
 was a very welcome break because I'm looking for any excuse to stop whatsoever.

1:41:33.340 --> 1:41:38.500
 A gentleman, very nice gentleman stopped me saying recognize me and just said a bunch

1:41:38.500 --> 1:41:40.380
 of friendly things.

1:41:40.380 --> 1:41:46.660
 And then he mentioned as, as one of the people who really inspires him is Duncan Trussell.

1:41:46.660 --> 1:41:54.900
 And I was, I mean, I'm the same way and I told him, you know, tomorrow, it felt like

1:41:54.900 --> 1:41:55.900
 a name drop.

1:41:55.900 --> 1:41:58.220
 I name drop you this morning.

1:41:58.220 --> 1:42:00.340
 I was like, tomorrow I'm going to get to meet him.

1:42:00.340 --> 1:42:06.700
 And he says, he says, hi, and there's, oh, and he said that he watched Midnight Gospel

1:42:06.700 --> 1:42:11.700
 on, on mushrooms and it was like the greatest mushroom experience of his life.

1:42:11.700 --> 1:42:12.700
 I don't know.

1:42:12.700 --> 1:42:13.700
 Yeah, man.

1:42:13.700 --> 1:42:15.980
 I, yeah, I was nervous about meeting you, man.

1:42:15.980 --> 1:42:18.780
 Like, I have so much respect for you and like, yeah, I name dropped.

1:42:18.780 --> 1:42:21.900
 I was saying, I'm going on Lex's podcast today.

1:42:21.900 --> 1:42:24.420
 It's, you look, we're so lucky we all live here.

1:42:24.420 --> 1:42:25.420
 What the fuck?

1:42:25.420 --> 1:42:26.500
 We're all living in Austin together.

1:42:26.500 --> 1:42:32.620
 Like I, I thought I somehow like missed that, but that's, we all got to hang out.

1:42:32.620 --> 1:42:34.860
 We all have to like start doing stuff.

1:42:34.860 --> 1:42:37.220
 Well, you have to really also, you have to appreciate this moment.

1:42:37.220 --> 1:42:45.340
 I, I remember, I know some people are less sentimental than others, but I remember sitting

1:42:45.340 --> 1:42:54.340
 with Joe Rogan and with Eric Weisstein, I believe was, yeah, and at the back of the

1:42:54.340 --> 1:42:59.860
 comedy store shortly before COVID, I think.

1:42:59.860 --> 1:43:04.620
 And just thinking like, there's no way these things will last.

1:43:04.620 --> 1:43:11.300
 And these things, meaning the comedy store, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan D, Joe Rogan, like a

1:43:11.300 --> 1:43:15.260
 pot, like a pocket influential podcasting person.

1:43:15.260 --> 1:43:24.700
 Also, a person like in this room in this space, the ability to just talk for hours and lose

1:43:24.700 --> 1:43:26.460
 ourselves in this moment.

1:43:26.460 --> 1:43:30.020
 It just felt ephemeral somehow, temporary.

1:43:30.020 --> 1:43:34.500
 And I just wanted to capture that moment somehow, like, I don't know.

1:43:34.500 --> 1:43:38.180
 Sometimes that's where the temptation to take a picture on you, that kind of stuff or record

1:43:38.180 --> 1:43:43.340
 a podcast comes from, but just felt like it would be, it'd be gone forever.

1:43:43.340 --> 1:43:49.060
 Of course, Joe doesn't seem to have that kind of sentimental notion of just wherever you

1:43:49.060 --> 1:43:51.500
 end up, you just enjoy the shit out of it.

1:43:51.500 --> 1:43:52.500
 Right.

1:43:52.500 --> 1:43:53.500
 That's it.

1:43:53.500 --> 1:43:54.500
 Well, and that's something you have to cultivate.

1:43:54.500 --> 1:43:58.980
 You don't, that's not an easy, but the thing you're talking about, you know, God, if you

1:43:58.980 --> 1:44:03.720
 see these, I think the best analogy for what you're talking about, there's these videos

1:44:03.720 --> 1:44:08.300
 where people give like a sugar cube to a raccoon, but the raccoons, they wash their

1:44:08.300 --> 1:44:09.300
 food.

1:44:09.300 --> 1:44:13.060
 So raccoon, or I think it's cotton candy, they give the raccoon cotton candy, immediately

1:44:13.060 --> 1:44:17.500
 it washes the cotton candy, and of course the cotton candy dissolves in the water, and

1:44:17.500 --> 1:44:23.660
 the raccoon is like, what the fuck, like, you know, and the thing, that grasping you're

1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:26.740
 talking about, it's like the raccoon washing the cotton candy.

1:44:26.740 --> 1:44:33.860
 Like the moment you get into the grasping part, you paradoxically have pulled yourself

1:44:33.860 --> 1:44:38.100
 out of the moment that inspired the grasping part.

1:44:38.100 --> 1:44:42.620
 And that's, you know, that's some people, that's the entirety of their lives.

1:44:42.620 --> 1:44:47.100
 Trying to record, I mean, Jesus man, you ever see people film fireworks on the 4th of July

1:44:47.100 --> 1:44:48.100
 with their phone?

1:44:48.100 --> 1:44:54.340
 It's one of the most remarkable aspects of human behavior, which is like, you know they're

1:44:54.340 --> 1:44:59.220
 not going to watch the fireworks on their phone.

1:44:59.220 --> 1:45:00.620
 Only a lunatic would do that.

1:45:00.620 --> 1:45:03.620
 Like who's going to go back and look at fireworks, but.

1:45:03.620 --> 1:45:08.980
 So we're also in this position where, because of podcasting, there is some aspect where

1:45:08.980 --> 1:45:16.100
 you can record a magical moment in time, together between two people, or even just with a camera.

1:45:16.100 --> 1:45:20.380
 So to get back to the lake that you were talking about, this is emptiness.

1:45:20.380 --> 1:45:21.380
 So that's emptiness.

1:45:21.380 --> 1:45:22.380
 That's what's known as emptiness.

1:45:22.380 --> 1:45:27.060
 The lake is emptiness, and that's what we are, emptiness, emptiness.

1:45:27.060 --> 1:45:34.020
 And that's another thing that gets very confused in Buddhism is that emptiness, and that emptiness

1:45:34.020 --> 1:45:40.900
 is, that's to me, like when I'm going to do a podcast, that's where I try to go.

1:45:40.900 --> 1:45:43.060
 I try to go just in the moment.

1:45:43.060 --> 1:45:46.220
 No agenda, you know, if I am nervous or whatever.

1:45:46.220 --> 1:45:50.300
 Okay, I'll feel the nervousness, but just in the, just drop into the moment.

1:45:50.300 --> 1:45:55.820
 That's when time changes, and then you look up, hours have passed, it feels like a second.

1:45:55.820 --> 1:46:02.860
 And the reason it feels like that is because if you successfully dropped into the moment,

1:46:02.860 --> 1:46:04.380
 it's the lake now.

1:46:04.380 --> 1:46:05.380
 It's emptiness.

1:46:05.380 --> 1:46:10.580
 It's forever, for a second, you're like dipping into eternity.

1:46:10.580 --> 1:46:17.300
 And yeah, it's a very strange thing to, as part of that, record it, you know, as part

1:46:17.300 --> 1:46:21.780
 of that, try to like grab it and put it out there, but it works.

1:46:21.780 --> 1:46:26.380
 Can you speak to that, to the Duncan Trussell family hour?

1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:32.140
 Can you speak about that purple lavender world you go to, when it's most intense and successful

1:46:32.140 --> 1:46:37.460
 for you, when you feel a sense of lightness and happiness, when it works?

1:46:37.460 --> 1:46:38.460
 Yeah.

1:46:38.460 --> 1:46:44.220
 Whether it's your own or a conversation with Joe in general, or it's, well, yours is very

1:46:44.220 --> 1:46:48.620
 specific because it's audio only, maybe you can also speak to that, because you might

1:46:48.620 --> 1:46:56.900
 as well be naked or you don't have to, you're free of the conventions of the real world.

1:46:56.900 --> 1:47:01.220
 I will never stop thinking it's remarkable.

1:47:01.220 --> 1:47:05.620
 Like the fact that I'm talking to you, to me, seems remarkable.

1:47:05.620 --> 1:47:11.060
 Not just technologically, but I'm talking to someone, I'm assuming I'm allowed to say

1:47:11.060 --> 1:47:21.100
 this, who has robot dogs that I've been watching for years evolve on YouTube, arms reach away

1:47:21.100 --> 1:47:27.820
 from one of these things, you know, and I'm with somebody who is like an acclaimed genius.

1:47:27.820 --> 1:47:33.660
 So for me, it's like, oh my God, how's, what, why do I get to have this conversation?

1:47:33.660 --> 1:47:34.980
 Why do I get to be here?

1:47:34.980 --> 1:47:39.260
 When there would be like a line, there'd be a line that would just wrapped and wrapped

1:47:39.260 --> 1:47:43.420
 and wrapped around this building of people who'd love a chance to just chat with you.

1:47:43.420 --> 1:47:49.420
 And so when I, with my podcast, that's how I feel, like when I'm talking to these guests,

1:47:49.420 --> 1:47:58.580
 you know, who have spent, you know, some of them have like spent their entire lifetime meditating,

1:47:58.580 --> 1:48:04.380
 you know, studying specific aspects of Buddhism or even when I'm with, you know, when I'm

1:48:04.380 --> 1:48:08.940
 with comedians who I like consider to be brilliantly funny.

1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:15.500
 So for me, it's just like, God, I almost feel like I've just created some sophisticated

1:48:15.500 --> 1:48:19.220
 trap for cool people where like I get to like hang out with them.

1:48:19.220 --> 1:48:23.180
 So you're like sitting in the gratitude of it, just, just feeling lucky.

1:48:23.180 --> 1:48:24.180
 Yeah.

1:48:24.180 --> 1:48:25.180
 Yeah.

1:48:25.180 --> 1:48:28.140
 Feeling lucky and wrestling with imposter syndrome, you know, trying to like get that

1:48:28.140 --> 1:48:32.020
 part of myself to shut up long enough so I could be in that moment that we're talking

1:48:32.020 --> 1:48:33.580
 about, you know.

1:48:33.580 --> 1:48:36.140
 And then, and then I carry that with me.

1:48:36.140 --> 1:48:40.460
 It's not just like you stop the podcast, it's like some of the things these people tell

1:48:40.460 --> 1:48:45.220
 me or some of the ways they are, like it becomes part of me.

1:48:45.220 --> 1:48:52.180
 And then I get to have a life where this thing that they gave me is in, in me forever.

1:48:52.180 --> 1:48:54.180
 And so yeah, it's, it's, there's,

1:48:54.180 --> 1:48:55.180
 Yeah.

1:48:55.180 --> 1:49:00.620
 It's cool how conversation can just a few sentences can change the direction of your

1:49:00.620 --> 1:49:01.620
 life.

1:49:01.620 --> 1:49:05.900
 If you're listening, if you're there to be transformed by the words, they will do the

1:49:05.900 --> 1:49:06.900
 work.

1:49:06.900 --> 1:49:07.900
 Yeah.

1:49:07.900 --> 1:49:09.900
 And it's the full mix of it.

1:49:09.900 --> 1:49:17.420
 It's usually when, if you look up to somebody, and it's true for me at least, I think it

1:49:17.420 --> 1:49:21.140
 is for you that you start to look up to basically everybody you talk to.

1:49:21.140 --> 1:49:22.140
 Yes.

1:49:22.140 --> 1:49:23.140
 Yes.

1:49:23.140 --> 1:49:24.140
 Good sign.

1:49:24.140 --> 1:49:25.140
 Yeah.

1:49:25.140 --> 1:49:26.140
 That's a good sign.

1:49:26.140 --> 1:49:27.140
 God forbid it goes the other way.

1:49:27.140 --> 1:49:28.140
 Yeah.

1:49:28.140 --> 1:49:29.140
 You're in trouble.

1:49:29.140 --> 1:49:30.140
 Yeah.

1:49:30.140 --> 1:49:33.180
 If all of a sudden you start looking down on people, because whatever crazy metric you're

1:49:33.180 --> 1:49:35.900
 using, ooh, that would freak me out.

1:49:35.900 --> 1:49:38.260
 I do feel like that's a quality of getting older.

1:49:38.260 --> 1:49:42.020
 When I was younger, I really, like, I thought I was so smart.

1:49:42.020 --> 1:49:43.380
 Like I thought I all figured out.

1:49:43.380 --> 1:49:44.380
 Oh really?

1:49:44.380 --> 1:49:47.740
 So you're going, your ego is just going, taking a nosedive.

1:49:47.740 --> 1:49:50.260
 I would like to say it's my ego taking a nosedive.

1:49:50.260 --> 1:49:52.460
 I've, me and my friend talk about it a bunch.

1:49:52.460 --> 1:49:57.660
 We've just always associated it with like doing acid for two decades straight.

1:49:57.660 --> 1:50:02.940
 Like I'm just assume I'm just like slowly like spiraling into senility, you know?

1:50:02.940 --> 1:50:08.220
 Like I'm just like, I, I, I, all the confidence, all the like, oh, the certainty.

1:50:08.220 --> 1:50:13.420
 When you're having like in college, you're having the great, like, like, you know, you've,

1:50:13.420 --> 1:50:18.700
 I remember you're, you feel like you're a representative of Camus or some shit.

1:50:18.700 --> 1:50:19.700
 You know what I mean?

1:50:19.700 --> 1:50:24.740
 You read the myth of Sisyphus and now you like it, know all existentialism and your certainty

1:50:24.740 --> 1:50:29.740
 in regards to it is embarrassing, but you don't see it in that way.

1:50:29.740 --> 1:50:35.140
 You just feel certain and then that certainty, it just starts like, it starts crumbling a

1:50:35.140 --> 1:50:36.140
 little bit.

1:50:36.140 --> 1:50:43.980
 And yeah, you know, I get to actually intensely experience that certainty in many communities,

1:50:43.980 --> 1:50:50.580
 but one in cryptocurrency, young folks with the certainty that this technology would transform

1:50:50.580 --> 1:50:52.080
 the world.

1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:57.900
 And I mean, this is almost one of the big communities of the modern era where they believe that

1:50:57.900 --> 1:51:03.700
 this will really solve so many of the problems of the world and they believe in it very intensely.

1:51:03.700 --> 1:51:08.780
 And aside from the technology and the details of the thing, all I see is the certainty and

1:51:08.780 --> 1:51:14.340
 the passion in their eyes, they'll stop me, let me, let me explain you, let me, let me

1:51:14.340 --> 1:51:19.180
 just give me a chance to tell you why this thing is extremely powerful.

1:51:19.180 --> 1:51:24.900
 And I just get to enjoy the glow of that because it's like, wow, this, I, I missed having

1:51:24.900 --> 1:51:27.620
 that certainty about anything.

1:51:27.620 --> 1:51:33.620
 It's probably come over for me to, but when I was younger, it's like, only I, you know,

1:51:33.620 --> 1:51:40.460
 I deeply understand the, the relationship of man to his mortality.

1:51:40.460 --> 1:51:44.580
 And I understood that most deeply, I think when I was like 16 or 17.

1:51:44.580 --> 1:51:50.140
 And I have, I am the representative of the human condition and all these adults with

1:51:50.140 --> 1:51:55.740
 their busyness of day to day life and their concerns, they don't deeply understand what

1:51:55.740 --> 1:52:03.980
 I understand, which is the only thing that matters is the absurdity of the human condition.

1:52:03.980 --> 1:52:04.980
 Yeah.

1:52:04.980 --> 1:52:05.980
 Yeah.

1:52:05.980 --> 1:52:06.980
 And let me quote you some Dostoevsky.

1:52:06.980 --> 1:52:07.980
 Oh boy.

1:52:07.980 --> 1:52:08.980
 And you speak Russian.

1:52:08.980 --> 1:52:09.980
 Yeah.

1:52:09.980 --> 1:52:10.980
 Speak Russian.

1:52:10.980 --> 1:52:13.660
 So you've read the Brothers Karamazov in Russian.

1:52:13.660 --> 1:52:23.700
 Unfortunately, I have to admit that I read all of Dostoevsky in English of, I came to

1:52:23.700 --> 1:52:26.580
 this country when I was 13, and at least don't remember.

1:52:26.580 --> 1:52:33.220
 We read a lot, but we read Tolstoy, Pushkin, a lot of the Russian literature, but it was

1:52:33.220 --> 1:52:35.620
 in Russian, but I don't remember reading Dostoevsky.

1:52:35.620 --> 1:52:40.900
 I wonder at which point does the Russian education system give you Dostoevsky?

1:52:40.900 --> 1:52:43.060
 Cause it's pretty heavy stuff.

1:52:43.060 --> 1:52:44.060
 Second grade.

1:52:44.060 --> 1:52:46.100
 Probably the second grade.

1:52:46.100 --> 1:52:47.100
 Russians are intense.

1:52:47.100 --> 1:52:48.100
 I don't remember.

1:52:48.100 --> 1:52:49.100
 Yeah.

1:52:49.100 --> 1:52:50.100
 They are.

1:52:50.100 --> 1:52:51.100
 They very, they very much are.

1:52:51.100 --> 1:52:56.060
 Dostoevsky, but I did a tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent.

1:52:56.060 --> 1:53:04.260
 I traveled to Paris recently on the way to Ukraine and was scheduled to talk to Richard

1:53:04.260 --> 1:53:12.980
 Pivir and this pair that translate Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, just this famous pair that translate

1:53:12.980 --> 1:53:15.220
 most of Russian literature to English.

1:53:15.220 --> 1:53:22.180
 And I was planning to have a sequence of five, 10, 15 hour conversation with them about the

1:53:22.180 --> 1:53:25.460
 different details of all the translations and so on.

1:53:25.460 --> 1:53:30.660
 I just found myself in a very dark place mentally where I couldn't think about podcasts or anything

1:53:30.660 --> 1:53:31.660
 like that.

1:53:31.660 --> 1:53:32.900
 It caught me off guard.

1:53:32.900 --> 1:53:39.540
 So I went to Paris and just laid there for a day, not just being stressed about Ukraine

1:53:39.540 --> 1:53:40.980
 and all those kinds of things.

1:53:40.980 --> 1:53:49.380
 But I'm still, the act of translation is such a fascinating way to approach some of the deepest

1:53:49.380 --> 1:53:55.700
 questions that this literature raises, which is like, how do I capture the essence of a

1:53:55.700 --> 1:53:59.980
 sentence that has so much power and translate it into another language?

1:53:59.980 --> 1:54:01.980
 That act is actually really, really interesting.

1:54:01.980 --> 1:54:09.380
 And I found with my conversations with them, they've really thought through this stuff.

1:54:09.380 --> 1:54:14.740
 It's not just about language, it's about the ideas in those books.

1:54:14.740 --> 1:54:20.940
 That also really makes me sad because I wonder how much is lost in translation.

1:54:20.940 --> 1:54:26.820
 So when I was in Ukraine, I talked to a lot of like half the conversations I had on the

1:54:26.820 --> 1:54:37.700
 record were in Russian and basically 100% off the record were in Russian versus in English.

1:54:37.700 --> 1:54:40.940
 And just so much is lost in those languages.

1:54:40.940 --> 1:54:47.900
 And I'm now struggling because I'm launching a Russian channel where there'll be a Russian

1:54:47.900 --> 1:54:50.980
 overdub of Duncan.

1:54:50.980 --> 1:54:53.540
 Your wow will now be translated into Russian.

1:54:53.540 --> 1:54:56.060
 What's Russian wow?

1:54:56.060 --> 1:54:57.500
 It'll just be wow probably.

1:54:57.500 --> 1:55:01.460
 I'm so sorry for the difficulties of having to translate wow.

1:55:01.460 --> 1:55:05.420
 Usually probably with wow, they'll leave it unoverdubbed because people will understand

1:55:05.420 --> 1:55:06.460
 exactly what you mean.

1:55:06.460 --> 1:55:09.180
 But that's an art form and it's a weird art form.

1:55:09.180 --> 1:55:24.860
 It's like how do you capture the chemistry, the excitement, the humor, the implied kind

1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:25.860
 of wit.

1:55:25.860 --> 1:55:31.220
 I don't know, there's just layers of complexity in language that it's very difficult to capture.

1:55:31.220 --> 1:55:36.060
 I wonder how it is sad for me because I know Russian and how much is lost in translation

1:55:36.060 --> 1:55:42.580
 and the same, there's a brewing conflict and tension with China now and so much is lost

1:55:42.580 --> 1:55:49.700
 in the translation between those languages and cultures.

1:55:49.700 --> 1:55:53.580
 The music of the people is completely lost because we don't know the language or most

1:55:53.580 --> 1:55:54.580
 of us don't know the language.

1:55:54.580 --> 1:55:58.100
 Yeah, how much of the conflict is just problems in translation?

1:55:58.100 --> 1:56:02.500
 How much of all these problems that we're having are just the alien sense of this or

1:56:02.500 --> 1:56:03.500
 that?

1:56:03.500 --> 1:56:04.740
 It's just as simple as that.

1:56:04.740 --> 1:56:15.660
 Words are getting just a tiny warp away from the intent of if when we both speak the same

1:56:15.660 --> 1:56:21.980
 language, we can still say something that offends someone when you never intended that

1:56:21.980 --> 1:56:23.100
 at all.

1:56:23.100 --> 1:56:30.220
 How much more so when it's not only is it a completely different sound, but the script

1:56:30.220 --> 1:56:37.580
 itself is different, like the Russian writing is it called Cyrillic or what's the name?

1:56:37.580 --> 1:56:38.580
 Yeah, Cyrillic.

1:56:38.580 --> 1:56:39.580
 Cyrillic.

1:56:39.580 --> 1:56:45.620
 And I don't know the name for Chinese writing, but it's a continuum that gets weirder and

1:56:45.620 --> 1:56:48.580
 weirder looking, you know?

1:56:48.580 --> 1:56:49.580
 So yeah.

1:56:49.580 --> 1:56:51.620
 Or less weird, depending on your perspective.

1:56:51.620 --> 1:56:54.620
 Yeah, I'm sure depending on where you're at.

1:56:54.620 --> 1:56:59.060
 I'm definitely, I'm about the farthest thing from a polyglot as there could be, man.

1:56:59.060 --> 1:57:06.020
 I'll tell you, at one point when I was getting fascinated by Dostoevsky, I did have this very

1:57:06.020 --> 1:57:11.460
 transient fantasy about learning Russian so that I could like understand the difference

1:57:11.460 --> 1:57:12.460
 in it.

1:57:12.460 --> 1:57:14.980
 You were 17, 18 at the time.

1:57:14.980 --> 1:57:15.980
 College.

1:57:15.980 --> 1:57:16.980
 Yeah.

1:57:16.980 --> 1:57:19.100
 Brothers Care of Mazov lost in that book.

1:57:19.100 --> 1:57:20.980
 Just like, oh God.

1:57:20.980 --> 1:57:24.780
 So in love with it.

1:57:24.780 --> 1:57:31.220
 So there's definitely like, you know, Ukraine, and this is what there's a lot of the wars

1:57:31.220 --> 1:57:35.660
 about saying, you know, Ukraine and Russia are not the same people.

1:57:35.660 --> 1:57:37.100
 There's a strong culture in Ukraine.

1:57:37.100 --> 1:57:38.980
 There's a strong culture in Russia.

1:57:38.980 --> 1:57:41.900
 But you know, I know because that's where my family's from.

1:57:41.900 --> 1:57:49.180
 There's a fascinating strong culture, but there's such strong cultures everywhere else

1:57:49.180 --> 1:57:50.180
 too.

1:57:50.180 --> 1:57:53.020
 Ireland has a culture, Scotland has a culture.

1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:59.380
 Like on a tiny island, you just have these like subcultures that are more powerful than

1:57:59.380 --> 1:58:05.860
 anything exists in human history, like the Bronx, I don't know, like Brooklyn, like different

1:58:05.860 --> 1:58:07.660
 parts of New York have a certain culture.

1:58:07.660 --> 1:58:11.980
 And then New York versus LA versus, well, and then certain places are looking for their

1:58:11.980 --> 1:58:12.980
 culture.

1:58:12.980 --> 1:58:18.740
 Like, I don't, I think Austin, I don't know what Austin is, and I don't think anyone knows.

1:58:18.740 --> 1:58:23.740
 There's a, there's a traditional Austin, and then it's evolving constantly.

1:58:23.740 --> 1:58:26.540
 Same with Boston, a place I spent a lot of time.

1:58:26.540 --> 1:58:31.420
 There's a traditional Boston and now it's evolving with the different younger people

1:58:31.420 --> 1:58:35.180
 coming from the university and staying and all of that is evolving.

1:58:35.180 --> 1:58:40.180
 But underneath it, there's a core, like the American ideal of the value of the individual,

1:58:40.180 --> 1:58:45.420
 the value of freedom, freedom of speech, all those kinds of things that permeates all of

1:58:45.420 --> 1:58:46.420
 that.

1:58:46.420 --> 1:58:54.620
 And the history of World War II permeates Ukraine and Russia, a lot of parts of Europe,

1:58:54.620 --> 1:59:01.540
 the memories of all that suffering, destruction, the broken promises of governments and the

1:59:01.540 --> 1:59:08.500
 occupier versus the liberator, all that kind of stuff, all that permeates the culture.

1:59:08.500 --> 1:59:16.100
 That affects how cynical or optimistic you are or how much you appreciate material possessions

1:59:16.100 --> 1:59:19.540
 versus human connection, all that kind of stuff.

1:59:19.540 --> 1:59:23.740
 Yeah, it's, I mean, this is like, talk about absurdity.

1:59:23.740 --> 1:59:31.060
 I mean, this is war is like, it's the, what absurdity looks like, it's, it's some kind

1:59:31.060 --> 1:59:32.620
 of organized madness.

1:59:32.620 --> 1:59:33.620
 None of it makes sense.

1:59:33.620 --> 1:59:38.100
 Like, all of it, like it's just, none of it makes sense, like, but it does.

1:59:38.100 --> 1:59:39.100
 But it doesn't.

1:59:39.100 --> 1:59:43.380
 I mean, obviously you're defending yourself or you're taking orders that if you don't

1:59:43.380 --> 1:59:48.380
 take, you're, you're going to jail and so, or some, somewhere in between, you know, the

1:59:48.380 --> 1:59:53.820
 classic story about this, maybe it's a bullshit myth about World War II, you've, I'm sure

1:59:53.820 --> 2:00:01.380
 everyone's heard it because it comes up, you know, it's Christmas Eve and they have a ceasefire.

2:00:01.380 --> 2:00:06.180
 And then I think they played soccer, they sing Christmas songs, and then they had to

2:00:06.180 --> 2:00:09.140
 force them into fighting again.

2:00:09.140 --> 2:00:15.460
 And so when those moments happen, the, are you familiar with Hakeem Bay?

2:00:15.460 --> 2:00:21.100
 He's a controversial figure, sadly, like he, like, I think he was like, I'm not going to

2:00:21.100 --> 2:00:25.060
 defame him because I haven't like researched it correctly, but some people have said shit.

2:00:25.060 --> 2:00:30.260
 But since I don't know the reference, I'm not going to, but regardless, I mean, you

2:00:30.260 --> 2:00:35.580
 know, look, I'm sorry, but Bill Cosby was funny, you know, like, that's a, that's a

2:00:35.580 --> 2:00:43.700
 funny comedian, but you know, the other stuff, Michael Jackson, he could fucking dance and

2:00:43.700 --> 2:00:46.380
 sing and sing, but there's some other stuff.

2:00:46.380 --> 2:00:52.420
 But regardless, Hakeem Bay came up with the idea of something called a temporary autonomous

2:00:52.420 --> 2:01:01.940
 zone, which is that within a structure, a cultural structure, a temporary bubble of

2:01:01.940 --> 2:01:11.660
 freedom will appear that by its nature gets sort of popped by the bigger bubble or it

2:01:11.660 --> 2:01:13.860
 runs out of resources generally is what happens.

2:01:13.860 --> 2:01:21.420
 So these things will appear just out of the blue that it's almost like I imagine if like

2:01:21.420 --> 2:01:28.420
 on earth in some tiny little bit of earth, the gravitational field was reduced by some

2:01:28.420 --> 2:01:29.420
 percentage.

2:01:29.420 --> 2:01:32.260
 And you could jump really high or whatever, but it wouldn't last.

2:01:32.260 --> 2:01:36.660
 It's like that culturally, all the restrictions and the darkness and the heaviness and all

2:01:36.660 --> 2:01:38.820
 of it for a second.

2:01:38.820 --> 2:01:47.980
 Somehow this bubble appears where humans come together as the hippie ideal, brothers, sisters,

2:01:47.980 --> 2:01:56.500
 just humans, earthlings instead of American, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian, temporary autonomous

2:01:56.500 --> 2:02:01.420
 zone, it gets crushed by the default reality that it was appearing in.

2:02:01.420 --> 2:02:09.220
 But somehow within that space, you witness the possibility, the possibility, the frustrating

2:02:09.220 --> 2:02:16.260
 possibility that anyone who's thought about humanity knows this possibility, which is

2:02:16.260 --> 2:02:18.780
 like, it seems like we can just get along.

2:02:18.780 --> 2:02:23.820
 Like it does seem like we're pretty much the same thing and then we can just get along.

2:02:23.820 --> 2:02:26.780
 Those moments are really rare.

2:02:26.780 --> 2:02:27.780
 It's sad.

2:02:27.780 --> 2:02:34.100
 I talked to a lot of soldiers, a lot of people that were suffered through the different aspects

2:02:34.100 --> 2:02:37.500
 of that war.

2:02:37.500 --> 2:02:45.460
 And there's an information war that convinces each side that the other is not just the enemy,

2:02:45.460 --> 2:02:48.260
 but less than human.

2:02:48.260 --> 2:02:53.500
 So there's a real hatred towards the other side.

2:02:53.500 --> 2:03:00.940
 And those kind of little moments where you realize, oh, they're human like me and not

2:03:00.940 --> 2:03:09.340
 just like human like me, but they have the same values as me.

2:03:09.340 --> 2:03:18.860
 This woman who is a really respected soldier, she specializes in anti tank missiles.

2:03:18.860 --> 2:03:25.660
 And she, she's very kind of very pragmatic, very, the enemy is the enemy who have to destroy

2:03:25.660 --> 2:03:29.820
 the enemy and saying like, there's no compassion towards the enemy.

2:03:29.820 --> 2:03:31.620
 They're not, they're not human.

2:03:31.620 --> 2:03:34.100
 They're less than human.

2:03:34.100 --> 2:03:42.700
 But she said there was, there was a moment when she remembers an enemy soldier in a tank

2:03:42.700 --> 2:03:48.060
 took a risk to save a fellow soldier and that risk was really stupid because he was facing

2:03:48.060 --> 2:03:50.340
 he was going to get destroyed.

2:03:50.340 --> 2:04:00.060
 And then she said that she tried to shoot a rocket at that tank and she missed.

2:04:00.060 --> 2:04:03.940
 And then she later went home and she couldn't sleep that she missed, how could she screw

2:04:03.940 --> 2:04:04.940
 that up?

2:04:04.940 --> 2:04:13.420
 But then she realized that actually she missed, maybe she missed on purpose because she realized

2:04:13.420 --> 2:04:21.340
 that that man, just like she is, was a hero, just like she strives to be.

2:04:21.340 --> 2:04:25.260
 They were both heroes defending their own.

2:04:25.260 --> 2:04:27.500
 And in that way, he was just like her.

2:04:27.500 --> 2:04:32.940
 She was like, that's the only time I remember doing this war ever feeling like this is another

2:04:32.940 --> 2:04:33.940
 human being.

2:04:33.940 --> 2:04:39.540
 But that was a very brief moment, her and I just hear that over and over and over again.

2:04:39.540 --> 2:04:47.420
 These romantic notions we have of where one, that we're all just human, unfortunately during

2:04:47.420 --> 2:04:54.020
 war, those notions are rare and it's quite sad and war in a certain way really destroys

2:04:54.020 --> 2:04:55.300
 those notions.

2:04:55.300 --> 2:05:04.100
 And one of the saddest things is it destroys it, at least from what I see, potentially

2:05:04.100 --> 2:05:09.340
 for generations, not just for those people for the rest of their life, but for their

2:05:09.340 --> 2:05:12.180
 children, their children's children.

2:05:12.180 --> 2:05:13.180
 The hatred.

2:05:13.180 --> 2:05:19.940
 I mean, I ask that question of basically everyone, which is, will you ever forgive for asking

2:05:19.940 --> 2:05:23.100
 of Ukrainians, will you ever forgive the Russians?

2:05:23.100 --> 2:05:27.140
 Will you have hate in your heart towards the Russians?

2:05:27.140 --> 2:05:32.460
 Or do you have love for a fellow human being?

2:05:32.460 --> 2:05:37.660
 And there's different ways that people struggle with that, different people.

2:05:37.660 --> 2:05:44.460
 They saw the love, they saw the hate with their known heart and they struggle with the

2:05:44.460 --> 2:05:49.660
 hate they have and they know they can overcome it in a period of weeks and months after the

2:05:49.660 --> 2:05:50.660
 war is over.

2:05:50.660 --> 2:05:56.820
 But some people said, no, this hate that showed up in February when the war started will be

2:05:56.820 --> 2:05:57.820
 with me forever.

2:05:57.820 --> 2:05:58.820
 Well, yeah.

2:05:58.820 --> 2:05:59.820
 Their kids got killed.

2:05:59.820 --> 2:06:02.300
 What the fuck are you going to do about that?

2:06:02.300 --> 2:06:03.300
 Like I don't care.

2:06:03.300 --> 2:06:07.220
 I've got, you know, I've got aphorisms and cute little stories about, you know, you're still

2:06:07.220 --> 2:06:10.340
 in prison if you hate your former captors.

2:06:10.340 --> 2:06:15.300
 But man, I gotta tell you, if somebody hurt my kids, I'm not coming back.

2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:23.860
 I mean, there's no amount, at least right now in my approximation of spiritual literature,

2:06:23.860 --> 2:06:31.340
 meditation or anything that I can really think of that is going to give me that kind of space.

2:06:31.340 --> 2:06:38.460
 Like I think I imagine in the same way like, I imagine I could probably run a marathon

2:06:38.460 --> 2:06:42.980
 eventually, but do I think I'm ever going to do that?

2:06:42.980 --> 2:06:44.300
 That times a million.

2:06:44.300 --> 2:06:50.260
 So man, you know, all we can do is have compassion for their hate because it's like, what are

2:06:50.260 --> 2:06:52.180
 you going to tell, what are you going to say?

2:06:52.180 --> 2:06:58.060
 What are you going to say to someone like that, oh, oh, you know, for the sake of humanity,

2:06:58.060 --> 2:06:59.060
 let it go.

2:06:59.060 --> 2:07:00.540
 It was just your kids.

2:07:00.540 --> 2:07:05.460
 It was just something you loved more than anything in the world.

2:07:05.460 --> 2:07:06.460
 You'll never be okay again.

2:07:06.460 --> 2:07:10.620
 You don't have nightmares for the rest of your life, but you should forgive.

2:07:10.620 --> 2:07:11.620
 No.

2:07:11.620 --> 2:07:16.020
 Well, there is truth in the fact that forgiveness is the way to let go, right?

2:07:16.020 --> 2:07:22.180
 But that truth is not, fuck you, right?

2:07:22.180 --> 2:07:27.500
 Which is why it's not your job to say that, you know, it's not that you're doing that.

2:07:27.500 --> 2:07:28.500
 I know you're not.

2:07:28.500 --> 2:07:33.860
 But, you know, the problem with people like me, early phase, you could get this stupid

2:07:33.860 --> 2:07:40.140
 missionary thing going where you like, start trying to like, I don't know, like proselytize

2:07:40.140 --> 2:07:45.740
 ideals that you might be incapable of, you know, and I just hearing it, you know, that's

2:07:45.740 --> 2:07:50.940
 the, man, I saw this, the thing that like, I mean, I've seen a lot, all of us have by

2:07:50.940 --> 2:07:55.660
 now probably is online, I've seen, and you just saw it in person, like we've seen things

2:07:55.660 --> 2:07:58.860
 that are just horrific.

2:07:58.860 --> 2:08:06.980
 But as a dad, man, I just saw this clip of this kid around the age of my kid walking

2:08:06.980 --> 2:08:13.980
 by himself, these refugees just walking by himself, the look on his face, I can't explain

2:08:13.980 --> 2:08:15.740
 the look on his face.

2:08:15.740 --> 2:08:17.020
 I don't know what happened to his parents.

2:08:17.020 --> 2:08:18.460
 I don't know what happened.

2:08:18.460 --> 2:08:23.820
 Like I, it was so upsetting, I like even thinking about it now, it's just like, fuck, that could

2:08:23.820 --> 2:08:24.820
 have been my kid.

2:08:24.820 --> 2:08:33.700
 You know, so knowing that kind, that, that kid's got to grow up now, like, and I don't

2:08:33.700 --> 2:08:36.380
 know, is the kid's parents still there?

2:08:36.380 --> 2:08:42.980
 And that's just one of countless orphans out there now.

2:08:42.980 --> 2:08:48.300
 So you have this hate, and the question is how to direct it?

2:08:48.300 --> 2:08:53.420
 Because the choice is you can direct it towards the politicians that started the war.

2:08:53.420 --> 2:08:57.540
 You can direct it towards the soldiers that are doing the killing, or you can direct it

2:08:57.540 --> 2:09:00.620
 towards an entire group of people.

2:09:00.620 --> 2:09:08.540
 And that's the struggle because hate slowly grows to where you don't just hate the soldiers,

2:09:08.540 --> 2:09:17.300
 you don't just hate the leaders, you hate all Russians because they're all equally evil

2:09:17.300 --> 2:09:21.860
 because the ones that aren't doing the fighting are staying quiet.

2:09:21.860 --> 2:09:25.580
 And I'm sure the same kind of stories are happening on the other side.

2:09:25.580 --> 2:09:42.580
 And so there is that hate is one that is deeply human, but you wonder for your own future,

2:09:42.580 --> 2:09:48.220
 for your own home, for building your own community, for building your own country, how does that

2:09:48.220 --> 2:09:53.300
 hate morph over the weeks and months and years?

2:09:53.300 --> 2:09:57.940
 Not into forgiveness, but into something that's productive that doesn't destroy you, because

2:09:57.940 --> 2:09:59.740
 hate does destroy.

2:09:59.740 --> 2:10:11.020
 That's the dark aspect of a rocket that hits a building and kills hundreds of people.

2:10:11.020 --> 2:10:22.220
 The worst effect of that rocket is the hate in the hearts of the loved ones to the people

2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:24.100
 that were in that building.

2:10:24.100 --> 2:10:30.260
 That hate is a torture over a period of years after.

2:10:30.260 --> 2:10:36.780
 And that it doesn't just torture by having that psychological burden and trauma, it also

2:10:36.780 --> 2:10:39.860
 tortures because it destroys your life.

2:10:39.860 --> 2:10:43.980
 It prevents you from being able to enjoy your life to the fullest.

2:10:43.980 --> 2:10:52.860
 It prevents you from being able to flourish as a human being, as a professional, in all

2:10:52.860 --> 2:10:56.060
 those kinds of ways that humans can flourish.

2:10:56.060 --> 2:10:59.060
 I don't know.

2:10:59.060 --> 2:11:08.980
 There is an aspect where this naive notion is really powerful that love and forgiveness

2:11:08.980 --> 2:11:14.340
 is the thing that's needed in this time.

2:11:14.340 --> 2:11:23.260
 When I talk to soldiers, I remember bringing up to Jaco, is there a sense where the people

2:11:23.260 --> 2:11:26.980
 you're fighting are just brothers in arms, bringing up the Dire Straits song, Brothers

2:11:26.980 --> 2:11:29.140
 in Arms?

2:11:29.140 --> 2:11:33.260
 And he was basically without swearing, saying, fuck that, that they're the enemy.

2:11:33.260 --> 2:11:34.260
 Yeah.

2:11:34.260 --> 2:11:36.420
 I mean, he's literally in survival mode.

2:11:36.420 --> 2:11:37.540
 He can't think like that.

2:11:37.540 --> 2:11:40.900
 It's going to create latency in the system, and that's going to lower survivability.

2:11:40.900 --> 2:11:41.900
 You can't think that.

2:11:41.900 --> 2:11:45.780
 I mean, we're talking about, like, cognitively, you can't have latency.

2:11:45.780 --> 2:11:50.300
 Like, if you're that one moment of hesitation, like, you see it sometimes, like in these

2:11:50.300 --> 2:11:59.980
 YouTube videos of, like, somebody, a new cop has been unfortunate enough to run into something

2:11:59.980 --> 2:12:03.620
 that is a phenomenon, suicide by cop.

2:12:03.620 --> 2:12:09.580
 Somebody has a knife, and that person is running towards them with a knife, and they're begging

2:12:09.580 --> 2:12:12.620
 the person to stop, that you can hear it in their voice.

2:12:12.620 --> 2:12:19.420
 They're begging, stop, stop, stop, stop, and the person is not going to stop.

2:12:19.420 --> 2:12:29.500
 So the critique of that is that that latency could potentially not just lead to the cop

2:12:29.500 --> 2:12:34.540
 getting killed, but to that person with a knife killing other people.

2:12:34.540 --> 2:12:43.340
 And so, you know, I get, if I were out there, I think that, like, you won't, you probably

2:12:43.340 --> 2:12:48.180
 just as a matter of, like, not getting shot and being fully in the moment, you have to

2:12:48.180 --> 2:12:49.180
 be like that.

2:12:49.180 --> 2:12:50.180
 I would guess.

2:12:50.180 --> 2:12:51.180
 I don't know.

2:12:51.180 --> 2:12:52.180
 I don't know.

2:12:52.180 --> 2:12:53.180
 I'm the furthest thing from a soldier there could be.

2:12:53.180 --> 2:13:00.540
 There's a something Jack Cornfield, this great Buddhist teacher says, which is, tend to the

2:13:00.540 --> 2:13:06.140
 part of the garden you can touch, meaning this is where we're at right now.

2:13:06.140 --> 2:13:11.780
 Thank God you and I, though we are experiencing some, like, ripples from what's going on over

2:13:11.780 --> 2:13:14.380
 there, everyone is, we're not there.

2:13:14.380 --> 2:13:23.380
 And thank God, we don't have to come up with the psychological program for people going

2:13:23.380 --> 2:13:27.740
 through that to no longer be encumbered by that hate.

2:13:27.740 --> 2:13:28.740
 Thank God.

2:13:28.740 --> 2:13:32.460
 And I don't know if that's just lazy or whatever, but it's like, you know, for me, I just have

2:13:32.460 --> 2:13:36.020
 to bring it back to, all right, well, here's where I'm at now.

2:13:36.020 --> 2:13:41.100
 And I don't, like, I don't want there to be war.

2:13:41.100 --> 2:13:44.620
 I don't want to hurt people, but yeah, I love what you said.

2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:52.260
 I think what you said is the, if anything is the most intelligent way of looking at

2:13:52.260 --> 2:13:56.820
 it, it's like, don't pretend that you're not going to feel that hate.

2:13:56.820 --> 2:13:58.420
 Like you, you're going to feel it.

2:13:58.420 --> 2:13:59.420
 There's no way around it.

2:13:59.420 --> 2:14:01.740
 Or like, because that's even worse, because then you're almost saying like, something's

2:14:01.740 --> 2:14:05.380
 wrong with them for feeling the hate or, you know, whatever.

2:14:05.380 --> 2:14:14.940
 But more along the lines, if you can avoid applying that hate to an entire country of

2:14:14.940 --> 2:14:18.140
 people, then do that.

2:14:18.140 --> 2:14:25.100
 Like just understand we're talking about like, not everybody.

2:14:25.100 --> 2:14:26.460
 I know it's not everybody.

2:14:26.460 --> 2:14:27.460
 I know it's not everybody.

2:14:27.460 --> 2:14:28.980
 It's just easier, isn't it?

2:14:28.980 --> 2:14:29.980
 Cognitively.

2:14:29.980 --> 2:14:39.100
 So easier to think all Russians, monsters, you know, all Russians, all whatever the particular

2:14:39.100 --> 2:14:42.100
 like thing is that you're supposed to not like.

2:14:42.100 --> 2:14:43.940
 It's easier somehow, weirdly.

2:14:43.940 --> 2:14:45.460
 You'd think that'd be more difficult.

2:14:45.460 --> 2:14:46.460
 Yeah.

2:14:46.460 --> 2:14:55.540
 But I guess the lesson is, if you give in to the easy solution, that's going to lead

2:14:55.540 --> 2:14:58.380
 to detrimental long term effects.

2:14:58.380 --> 2:14:59.380
 So.

2:14:59.380 --> 2:15:08.060
 So hate should be, it's such a powerful tool that you should try to control it for your

2:15:08.060 --> 2:15:13.780
 own sake, not because you owe anything to anybody, but for your own psychological development

2:15:13.780 --> 2:15:14.780
 over time.

2:15:14.780 --> 2:15:15.780
 Right.

2:15:15.780 --> 2:15:16.780
 Right.

2:15:16.780 --> 2:15:17.780
 That's it.

2:15:17.780 --> 2:15:18.780
 That's it.

2:15:18.780 --> 2:15:19.780
 Fuck.

2:15:19.780 --> 2:15:20.780
 Yeah.

2:15:20.780 --> 2:15:21.780
 Yeah.

2:15:21.780 --> 2:15:27.860
 In terms of dark places, you suffered from depression or has been some of the darker

2:15:27.860 --> 2:15:31.580
 places you've gone in your mind.

2:15:31.580 --> 2:15:32.700
 You know, I needed therapy, man.

2:15:32.700 --> 2:15:34.180
 I needed therapy for the longest time.

2:15:34.180 --> 2:15:36.820
 I just didn't get it.

2:15:36.820 --> 2:15:48.820
 So because of that, I would go through like bouts of like paralytic depression, like suicidal

2:15:48.820 --> 2:15:51.780
 depression, suicidal ideations that were more than just ideations.

2:15:51.780 --> 2:15:59.580
 I mean, I think like people get afraid when the thought of suicide appears in their consciousness.

2:15:59.580 --> 2:16:03.540
 They get really scared of themselves or they think there's something like, fuck, what's

2:16:03.540 --> 2:16:04.540
 going on with me?

2:16:04.540 --> 2:16:05.540
 Why would I think that?

2:16:05.540 --> 2:16:10.780
 But I think if we are suffering and, you know, as a natural part of wanting to reduce

2:16:10.780 --> 2:16:16.300
 suffering or not feel bad anymore, I mean, suicide is going to be a not like if we're

2:16:16.300 --> 2:16:18.420
 just, you know, you're just looking, what are all the options?

2:16:18.420 --> 2:16:20.020
 Let's brainstorm here.

2:16:20.020 --> 2:16:21.020
 You know what I mean?

2:16:21.020 --> 2:16:22.020
 Maybe more water.

2:16:22.020 --> 2:16:27.980
 You can start jogging, get some therapy, call my friends, all the stuff we all hear.

2:16:27.980 --> 2:16:32.300
 Or I could just, I think the height of my apartment building is probably the definitely

2:16:32.300 --> 2:16:34.820
 the right height to kill myself.

2:16:34.820 --> 2:16:44.020
 And then, so for me, like the few times where the ideation has gone towards like, when would

2:16:44.020 --> 2:16:45.620
 I do that?

2:16:45.620 --> 2:16:50.500
 How do I, what, you know, what do I need to like accomplish that?

2:16:50.500 --> 2:16:53.180
 And then like, that's where it gets really fucking scary.

2:16:53.180 --> 2:16:54.180
 That's where it's like terrifying.

2:16:54.180 --> 2:17:00.140
 So you start the actual details of the planning of how to commit suicide?

2:17:00.140 --> 2:17:01.140
 Yeah.

2:17:01.140 --> 2:17:02.820
 What's going to be the least painful way to do it?

2:17:02.820 --> 2:17:04.740
 What's going to be the most instantaneous way to do it?

2:17:04.740 --> 2:17:11.100
 What's the, you know, and with, you know, with depression, because it can be progressive,

2:17:11.100 --> 2:17:14.300
 you know, this is why you have to really just stay on top of it.

2:17:14.300 --> 2:17:16.260
 Anyone who's gone through depression knows what I'm talking about.

2:17:16.260 --> 2:17:17.260
 You got to stay on top of it.

2:17:17.260 --> 2:17:18.260
 Like you might need medication.

2:17:18.260 --> 2:17:22.100
 You know, I know this is controversial now, but it's still better than dying.

2:17:22.100 --> 2:17:27.060
 If you ask me, but at some point with depression, it like becomes paralyzing so you don't want

2:17:27.060 --> 2:17:30.700
 to get out of bed anymore and you're not taking showers anymore and you don't want to talk

2:17:30.700 --> 2:17:35.300
 to anybody anymore and you're not answering your phone anymore and, you know.

2:17:35.300 --> 2:17:39.940
 So like in a dark place that you might be in, it still might get worse.

2:17:39.940 --> 2:17:45.580
 So you should really do everything you can to get out of control.

2:17:45.580 --> 2:17:49.620
 And that's the, that's specific psychological disorder.

2:17:49.620 --> 2:17:54.180
 That's the problem because it, the things, it's like, if you start listening to what

2:17:54.180 --> 2:17:58.380
 you wanted, you think it's you, it's the depression, you start listening to it.

2:17:58.380 --> 2:18:00.940
 It wants you to stay in bed.

2:18:00.940 --> 2:18:05.340
 And then you're getting those fucking depression sleeps, you know, or you wake up and you're

2:18:05.340 --> 2:18:07.820
 more tired, like it's not working.

2:18:07.820 --> 2:18:12.300
 You're trying to escape reality by sleeping.

2:18:12.300 --> 2:18:18.900
 And so yeah, like you have to like, you're, it's, you're fighting for your, you're literally

2:18:18.900 --> 2:18:19.900
 fighting for your life.

2:18:19.900 --> 2:18:23.740
 It might not seem like that cause you can't, if you could see depression, if you could

2:18:23.740 --> 2:18:31.020
 see it, if you knew you had some inky, vaporous, octopus thing that was just wrapping around

2:18:31.020 --> 2:18:35.060
 you more and more and more and more, you would probably do everything you could to rip that

2:18:35.060 --> 2:18:36.060
 fucking thing off your body.

2:18:36.060 --> 2:18:41.220
 And if you couldn't get it off your body, you would be calling people to get help.

2:18:41.220 --> 2:18:43.620
 So it doesn't feel like a fight because you're exhausted.

2:18:43.620 --> 2:18:45.420
 There's no reason to move.

2:18:45.420 --> 2:18:48.060
 There's no, you don't see the meaning for any of it.

2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:50.260
 So it doesn't feel like a battle, but it is a battle.

2:18:50.260 --> 2:18:51.260
 You're not feeling.

2:18:51.260 --> 2:18:52.260
 I mean, that's the other thing.

2:18:52.260 --> 2:18:53.660
 You're just, you're basically not feeling.

2:18:53.660 --> 2:18:58.940
 You're like, you start going numb, at least that was my experience with it, numb and tired.

2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:05.380
 And then increasingly numb and tired and then increasingly sort of disconnecting from reality.

2:19:05.380 --> 2:19:09.380
 And then somewhere in there, that's when you start playing around with the idea of like,

2:19:09.380 --> 2:19:11.420
 oh, I don't know if it's worth it.

2:19:11.420 --> 2:19:16.620
 Now, you know, I think compared to some of my friends who haven't survived, obviously

2:19:16.620 --> 2:19:21.780
 who haven't survived depression, like mine was definitely not whatever theirs was like.

2:19:21.780 --> 2:19:27.340
 I've heard, I mean, to understand it for folks out there, maybe you haven't gone through it.

2:19:27.340 --> 2:19:34.300
 Just imagine if like, how bad you have to feel if death is the salute, like, like violence

2:19:34.300 --> 2:19:37.260
 against yourself so that you die is the solution.

2:19:37.260 --> 2:19:43.180
 Like just, it flies in the face of everything.

2:19:43.180 --> 2:19:49.180
 So I would, yeah, that was definitely the darkest place that I've ever been.

2:19:49.180 --> 2:19:54.220
 Just that death doesn't seem like, because you don't care about anything anymore, that

2:19:54.220 --> 2:19:56.540
 death just doesn't seem like that bad.

2:19:56.540 --> 2:19:57.540
 Yeah.

2:19:57.540 --> 2:20:05.420
 Like you're not able to appropriately assign the negative costs to this, this solution.

2:20:05.420 --> 2:20:06.420
 Right.

2:20:06.420 --> 2:20:07.980
 Like a reasonable solution.

2:20:07.980 --> 2:20:09.980
 Yeah.

2:20:09.980 --> 2:20:15.420
 But I think also what's going along with it is like, it's not like your brain isn't working.

2:20:15.420 --> 2:20:19.420
 Like you're not thinking, obviously you're not thinking clearly.

2:20:19.420 --> 2:20:23.060
 Like at least, again, this was my experience of it.

2:20:23.060 --> 2:20:24.060
 It's a fog.

2:20:24.060 --> 2:20:31.380
 You're in some kind of, like, you're confused, there's confusion, there's shame.

2:20:31.380 --> 2:20:32.380
 You feel embarrassed.

2:20:32.380 --> 2:20:33.380
 You feel embarrassed.

2:20:33.380 --> 2:20:34.980
 You want to get out of bed, you want to do stuff.

2:20:34.980 --> 2:20:39.300
 You want to be compelled to be social and do all the stuff, but you're not.

2:20:39.300 --> 2:20:40.300
 You're not.

2:20:40.300 --> 2:20:43.740
 And like you seem, if people don't know what's going on and you're not telling them because

2:20:43.740 --> 2:20:52.860
 you're embarrassed, because you want to have some like, you know, uncorrupted, unwarped

2:20:52.860 --> 2:20:58.060
 psyche, you know, you're like, it invites you to be secret about it.

2:20:58.060 --> 2:21:02.260
 That's one of its first tricks is it tells you not to tell anybody.

2:21:02.260 --> 2:21:06.420
 And that's deadly in that case, it's deadly.

2:21:06.420 --> 2:21:08.020
 What was the source of light?

2:21:08.020 --> 2:21:14.260
 What was the, what were for you and in general, the ways out?

2:21:14.260 --> 2:21:15.260
 Yeah.

2:21:15.260 --> 2:21:22.540
 So for me, the solutions, and again, man, for my depressed friends out there, please don't

2:21:22.540 --> 2:21:23.540
 get mad at me.

2:21:23.540 --> 2:21:26.900
 I'm not doing the thing of like, just put on a smile or any of that bullshit because

2:21:26.900 --> 2:21:32.100
 it doesn't feel like that when you're like, and when you're fighting it.

2:21:32.100 --> 2:21:38.460
 It's, it's like you are, you're in a, I don't know why I'm keep, I keep using these stupid

2:21:38.460 --> 2:21:42.700
 gravity analogies, but it's like the gravity has been turned up on your planet in every

2:21:42.700 --> 2:21:47.980
 single way by, so getting out of bed, you know, like.

2:21:47.980 --> 2:21:53.180
 By the way, gravity and quantum mechanics, one of the most beautiful things about our

2:21:53.180 --> 2:21:56.860
 reality, what the hell is each of those things?

2:21:56.860 --> 2:22:01.700
 So this isn't, you're not just talking about the hippie language.

2:22:01.700 --> 2:22:06.260
 It's still physicists pretending to understand something.

2:22:06.260 --> 2:22:10.140
 We're still at the very beginning of understanding this mysterious world of ours that seems to

2:22:10.140 --> 2:22:18.260
 be functioning according to these weirdly simple and yet universally powerful laws, which

2:22:18.260 --> 2:22:20.820
 we don't fully yet understand.

2:22:20.820 --> 2:22:25.340
 So please, the metaphor and the analogy of gravity, fully, fully applicable.

2:22:25.340 --> 2:22:28.140
 I don't know any other way to put it, and it's like somebody turned the gravitational

2:22:28.140 --> 2:22:29.980
 field of your mattress up by.

2:22:29.980 --> 2:22:30.980
 Everything is heavy.

2:22:30.980 --> 2:22:31.980
 Your body's heavy.

2:22:31.980 --> 2:22:34.100
 You don't want to get out of bed.

2:22:34.100 --> 2:22:37.820
 You will consider shitting or pissing the bed, because you're just like, who gives a

2:22:37.820 --> 2:22:38.820
 fuck?

2:22:38.820 --> 2:22:40.380
 I'll just lay in my shit and piss.

2:22:40.380 --> 2:22:41.380
 You're dying.

2:22:41.380 --> 2:22:44.900
 You're like, you're, you're, you're, it's, none of it makes sense.

2:22:44.900 --> 2:22:56.220
 So, and I feel like in retrospect, I'm making what I, what I've done a little, like I had

2:22:56.220 --> 2:23:02.820
 more lucidity, it was more of like a, when you're, you know, you're wrestling with someone

2:23:02.820 --> 2:23:06.980
 and you're just like, well, you do, it's different for you.

2:23:06.980 --> 2:23:12.100
 But for me, if I'm wrestling, I'm not thinking about jiu jitsu moves, I'm like, survival.

2:23:12.100 --> 2:23:13.380
 So it's like that.

2:23:13.380 --> 2:23:15.020
 It is a struggle.

2:23:15.020 --> 2:23:21.340
 Like it's like, you really have to deliberately fight everything.

2:23:21.340 --> 2:23:27.700
 So you start, so you can almost have a conversation with the depression.

2:23:27.700 --> 2:23:32.620
 And then what you do is you start doing the opposite of everything it's telling you to

2:23:32.620 --> 2:23:33.620
 do.

2:23:33.620 --> 2:23:36.700
 So it's telling you lay in bed.

2:23:36.700 --> 2:23:38.500
 So you get out of bed.

2:23:38.500 --> 2:23:41.060
 It's definitely telling you, don't fucking exercise.

2:23:41.060 --> 2:23:43.180
 You're going to go fucking exercise.

2:23:43.180 --> 2:23:44.180
 That's not going to do anything.

2:23:44.180 --> 2:23:46.460
 You can't probably have a heart attack.

2:23:46.460 --> 2:23:48.260
 You really want to go outside.

2:23:48.260 --> 2:23:50.700
 Don't go fucking exercise.

2:23:50.700 --> 2:23:54.940
 And they'll feel crazy and you won't want to do it.

2:23:54.940 --> 2:23:57.460
 If you wanted to do it, you wouldn't be depressed.

2:23:57.460 --> 2:24:00.460
 Like how often do you hear like one of the symptoms of depression?

2:24:00.460 --> 2:24:01.620
 You want to jog?

2:24:01.620 --> 2:24:03.060
 You want to get on a bike?

2:24:03.060 --> 2:24:04.060
 You know, you don't hear that.

2:24:04.060 --> 2:24:05.060
 That's not a symptom.

2:24:05.060 --> 2:24:12.260
 So you start, at least one solution, I just started doing the opposite of whatever the

2:24:12.260 --> 2:24:19.980
 voice is telling you to do the opposite that, and then suddenly that those, the gravitational

2:24:19.980 --> 2:24:22.340
 field diminishes a little bit.

2:24:22.340 --> 2:24:23.660
 It doesn't go all the way away.

2:24:23.660 --> 2:24:27.580
 And that's where you can fall right back into it because you just feel even slightly better.

2:24:27.580 --> 2:24:29.740
 You're like, oh, okay, I fixed it.

2:24:29.740 --> 2:24:37.020
 You know, really, I think if you, like in having been through therapy, the best solution

2:24:37.020 --> 2:24:42.980
 would be go to a fucking therapist as quickly as you can.

2:24:42.980 --> 2:24:46.860
 Just sit down with him and tell him what's going on.

2:24:46.860 --> 2:24:47.860
 I know what you're thinking.

2:24:47.860 --> 2:24:49.900
 How am I going to find a therapist?

2:24:49.900 --> 2:24:51.620
 Just do it.

2:24:51.620 --> 2:24:52.620
 Google it.

2:24:52.620 --> 2:24:53.620
 Go on Yelp.

2:24:53.620 --> 2:24:56.260
 All of this shit feels impossible.

2:24:56.260 --> 2:24:57.460
 You're like, I don't want to turn on the computer.

2:24:57.460 --> 2:24:58.460
 I don't want to do any of this.

2:24:58.460 --> 2:24:59.460
 You just have to.

2:24:59.460 --> 2:25:00.460
 I mean, you have to.

2:25:00.460 --> 2:25:01.740
 You do it if you're on fire.

2:25:01.740 --> 2:25:05.500
 You do it if you're on fire and someone's like, you know, here's a way to not be on fire.

2:25:05.500 --> 2:25:09.860
 Just this particular fire is, it doesn't make you want to run around screaming.

2:25:09.860 --> 2:25:15.940
 It just makes you want to fall asleep forever and that, but those little steps, I got lucky

2:25:15.940 --> 2:25:16.940
 because it worked.

2:25:16.940 --> 2:25:17.940
 It worked.

2:25:17.940 --> 2:25:18.940
 I started exercising.

2:25:18.940 --> 2:25:24.660
 I've been on antidepressants before when I was originally diagnosed with it.

2:25:24.660 --> 2:25:26.020
 Did those help?

2:25:26.020 --> 2:25:31.500
 You know, even with all the current research coming out about that maybe we were all wrong

2:25:31.500 --> 2:25:38.660
 about our understanding of depression, I do feel like it helped in a certain way.

2:25:38.660 --> 2:25:46.580
 It definitely made me stop thinking about, it stopped the intrusive thoughts, but I don't

2:25:46.580 --> 2:25:50.100
 know how much of that was placebo or how much of that, I don't know, but then also like

2:25:50.100 --> 2:25:51.820
 I couldn't come anymore.

2:25:51.820 --> 2:25:57.300
 That was the other fucked up thing like you're, you can't have orgasms and which might not

2:25:57.300 --> 2:26:03.060
 sound like a big deal, but you know, when I told my therapist that they actually took

2:26:03.060 --> 2:26:08.100
 me off them because I think she was realizing that it started diminishing a little bit.

2:26:08.100 --> 2:26:14.540
 But the one I'm talking about now that whatever episode or whatever you want to call it, I

2:26:14.540 --> 2:26:16.460
 just got lucky because it worked.

2:26:16.460 --> 2:26:18.420
 It worked and I started feeling better.

2:26:18.420 --> 2:26:19.420
 Thank God.

2:26:19.420 --> 2:26:24.420
 Now, if you suffer from depression out there and you've had a remission of the depression,

2:26:24.420 --> 2:26:32.020
 you know, it's really like it's scary to have mental illness because everyone gets

2:26:32.020 --> 2:26:33.020
 bummed out.

2:26:33.020 --> 2:26:34.020
 I mean, that's just normal.

2:26:34.020 --> 2:26:35.020
 Like you're going to get bummed out.

2:26:35.020 --> 2:26:36.620
 No, I want to do anything sometimes.

2:26:36.620 --> 2:26:38.180
 It doesn't mean you have a clinical depression.

2:26:38.180 --> 2:26:40.300
 You might just be bummed out or grieving.

2:26:40.300 --> 2:26:48.220
 There might be any number of things, but when I get really nervous, if some of those symptoms

2:26:48.220 --> 2:26:57.420
 start showing up and at one point I felt like that was happening again and I did intramuscular

2:26:57.420 --> 2:27:04.340
 ketamine therapy, which now that was the damnedest thing I've ever experienced aside

2:27:04.340 --> 2:27:14.260
 from the fact that ketamine is immensely psychedelic, I just remember going back to the hotel after

2:27:14.260 --> 2:27:24.060
 the experience with the clinician and with depression, it's like a headache that starts

2:27:24.060 --> 2:27:27.180
 coming on, but you're like, this headache might last for years.

2:27:27.180 --> 2:27:28.660
 It might last for six months.

2:27:28.660 --> 2:27:30.940
 It might get worse and worse and worse.

2:27:30.940 --> 2:27:37.380
 And so I went back to the hotel room and it was just gone.

2:27:37.380 --> 2:27:38.380
 Like I just felt normal.

2:27:38.380 --> 2:27:39.380
 I felt great.

2:27:39.380 --> 2:27:42.620
 It was like the most remarkable thing ever.

2:27:42.620 --> 2:27:46.100
 So look at the research on ketamine right now.

2:27:46.100 --> 2:27:49.140
 It's not like bullshit.

2:27:49.140 --> 2:27:50.580
 It's not like woo woo science.

2:27:50.580 --> 2:27:54.180
 There's really, really good data out there showing that something like, I think it's

2:27:54.180 --> 2:28:02.100
 60%, I don't know what the percentage is, but 60% of people with an endogenous depression

2:28:02.100 --> 2:28:07.860
 when they get ketamine therapy will experience remission regardless of whether you trip out

2:28:07.860 --> 2:28:08.860
 or not.

2:28:08.860 --> 2:28:11.900
 It just does something that I don't know if they know what it is yet.

2:28:11.900 --> 2:28:12.900
 I don't care if they do.

2:28:12.900 --> 2:28:17.540
 But that one thing worked and basically you keep fighting until something works.

2:28:17.540 --> 2:28:18.540
 Exactly.

2:28:18.540 --> 2:28:19.540
 It's a survival issue.

2:28:19.540 --> 2:28:27.220
 I think because it's kind of so slow moving, you might even forget it's progressive.

2:28:27.220 --> 2:28:31.980
 You could easily just think that you're just a kind of bummed out person or you start thinking

2:28:31.980 --> 2:28:37.460
 that these aspects of your psychology are permanent when they don't have to be.

2:28:37.460 --> 2:28:40.260
 What about other people in your life?

2:28:40.260 --> 2:28:44.940
 What advice would you give to people that have loved ones who suffer from depression?

2:28:44.940 --> 2:28:46.500
 What are they to do?

2:28:46.500 --> 2:28:47.500
 Okay.

2:28:47.500 --> 2:28:55.300
 It's really like, man, it's really dark.

2:28:55.300 --> 2:28:57.620
 Here's number one.

2:28:57.620 --> 2:29:01.420
 This is what somebody told me when I lost a friend to suicide, because when you lose

2:29:01.420 --> 2:29:05.900
 a friend to suicide, when you lose a loved one to suicide, you're going to blame yourself.

2:29:05.900 --> 2:29:14.940
 It's like in the periphery of suicide, there is a circumference of guilty people who all

2:29:14.940 --> 2:29:19.700
 feel like, oh, if only I'd said this at the right time, if only I'd listened more, if

2:29:19.700 --> 2:29:27.540
 only I'd seen that warning signer, if only this or that, it's interesting in that with

2:29:27.540 --> 2:29:38.420
 other forms of disease, if your loved one dies from cancer, say, more than likely, you're

2:29:38.420 --> 2:29:42.660
 not going to be thinking like, oh, I should have cured their cancer.

2:29:42.660 --> 2:29:46.180
 It's a tragedy, but at least you're not like, if only I had.

2:29:46.180 --> 2:29:49.660
 You still might think that's part of grief, but...

2:29:49.660 --> 2:29:52.300
 It's not as sticky in many of the other situations.

2:29:52.300 --> 2:29:56.380
 Here, the guilt couldn't really stay for a long time.

2:29:56.380 --> 2:30:06.300
 So number one, we're talking about a progressive disease that can lead to death, and if somebody

2:30:06.300 --> 2:30:12.260
 commits suicide, they wanted to commit suicide, and at least what I've been told is you can't

2:30:12.260 --> 2:30:13.260
 stop it.

2:30:13.260 --> 2:30:14.260
 It's going to happen.

2:30:14.260 --> 2:30:15.860
 It's going to happen.

2:30:15.860 --> 2:30:16.860
 There are no magic words.

2:30:16.860 --> 2:30:18.380
 There's nothing you could do.

2:30:18.380 --> 2:30:24.460
 So people who've lost people to suicide, you know what I'm talking about.

2:30:24.460 --> 2:30:29.900
 You can watch it happen in real time, and there's nothing you could do.

2:30:29.900 --> 2:30:36.020
 That being said, being responsive to when it seems like someone's really reaching out

2:30:36.020 --> 2:30:43.500
 for help and knowing that maybe, especially if it's someone who doesn't talk like this

2:30:43.500 --> 2:30:48.060
 a lot of the time, and sentences start coming out of their mouth, that if you weren't really

2:30:48.060 --> 2:30:52.780
 paying attention, might not seem like a big deal, but for this person, it's kind of anomalous

2:30:52.780 --> 2:30:56.580
 that all of a sudden that's happening.

2:30:56.580 --> 2:31:01.540
 Now there, that's when you can be a good listener and open up to them and hear what they're

2:31:01.540 --> 2:31:04.180
 saying and see, like, oh, shit, are they asking me for it?

2:31:04.180 --> 2:31:05.900
 Is this them asking for help?

2:31:05.900 --> 2:31:12.740
 And even if you're like, I don't know what to do, at least you can start checking in

2:31:12.740 --> 2:31:18.900
 on them, help them understand that you're there for them, and then hopefully get them

2:31:18.900 --> 2:31:24.220
 into therapy, get them to a doctor, get them to a professional who can see what's going

2:31:24.220 --> 2:31:26.020
 on there.

2:31:26.020 --> 2:31:27.020
 And then there's hope.

2:31:27.020 --> 2:31:29.420
 And even then, there might not be hope, actually.

2:31:29.420 --> 2:31:30.420
 Doctors can't stop it.

2:31:30.420 --> 2:31:39.180
 You know, sometimes it just, that's the way it goes, but I know that being sensitive,

2:31:39.180 --> 2:31:43.140
 if somebody's all of a sudden hitting you up or reaching out to you that normally isn't

2:31:43.140 --> 2:31:46.140
 like that, and just, what's going on?

2:31:46.140 --> 2:31:47.140
 How are you?

2:31:47.140 --> 2:31:48.140
 And just listen.

2:31:48.140 --> 2:31:55.540
 Which in general, depression or not is probably a good thing to do, to truly listen.

2:31:55.540 --> 2:31:57.940
 It's like, are you okay?

2:31:57.940 --> 2:31:58.940
 Yeah.

2:31:58.940 --> 2:31:59.940
 Yeah.

2:31:59.940 --> 2:32:00.940
 Yeah.

2:32:00.940 --> 2:32:04.100
 You know, I don't, this whole thing of like cries for help, man, they don't, sometimes

2:32:04.100 --> 2:32:09.140
 they just look like a weird text, you know, and you don't realize for the person to send

2:32:09.140 --> 2:32:12.220
 that fucking text, they've been thinking about it all morning.

2:32:12.220 --> 2:32:16.580
 They've been just trying to get their phone up from the floor.

2:32:16.580 --> 2:32:20.060
 So you know, I think that, that's it.

2:32:20.060 --> 2:32:21.820
 I mean, I don't know.

2:32:21.820 --> 2:32:22.820
 I don't know.

2:32:22.820 --> 2:32:29.740
 I've had friends like kill themselves, so, and many of them it wasn't like, sadly it

2:32:29.740 --> 2:32:31.300
 was like, I don't know.

2:32:31.300 --> 2:32:34.100
 I don't know what could have been done, but.

2:32:34.100 --> 2:32:37.820
 But there's still, still a guilt in the back of your head.

2:32:37.820 --> 2:32:41.020
 For the rest of my life, for sure, always will be.

2:32:41.020 --> 2:32:42.020
 Yeah.

2:32:42.020 --> 2:32:44.700
 I mean, yeah, but again, what are you going to do?

2:32:44.700 --> 2:32:48.980
 But even that, it's a part of love.

2:32:48.980 --> 2:32:49.980
 That's right.

2:32:49.980 --> 2:32:50.980
 That's right.

2:32:50.980 --> 2:32:51.980
 Yeah.

2:32:51.980 --> 2:32:52.980
 That's right.

2:32:52.980 --> 2:32:53.980
 You could, yeah.

2:32:53.980 --> 2:32:54.980
 And we, you know, we feel guilt.

2:32:54.980 --> 2:32:55.980
 Part of grief is guilt, you know?

2:32:55.980 --> 2:32:58.580
 Like you, we always could have been better people.

2:32:58.580 --> 2:33:00.460
 We always could have been better people.

2:33:00.460 --> 2:33:02.020
 You get into Victor for Uncle Much.

2:33:02.020 --> 2:33:03.460
 Yeah, of course.

2:33:03.460 --> 2:33:05.940
 Man search for meaning.

2:33:05.940 --> 2:33:13.860
 The invitation to live your life as though you'd been on your death bed and it'd been

2:33:13.860 --> 2:33:18.620
 given the chance to go back and not make the same mistakes.

2:33:18.620 --> 2:33:25.140
 I returned to that idea all the time, meaning it's like, okay, whatever you did before this

2:33:25.140 --> 2:33:26.140
 moment.

2:33:26.140 --> 2:33:28.260
 It was too late.

2:33:28.260 --> 2:33:31.220
 But now, you know, this is where you can start.

2:33:31.220 --> 2:33:32.660
 This is where you can start.

2:33:32.660 --> 2:33:39.620
 And yeah, so I think that for a neurotic like me, that's super important because otherwise

2:33:39.620 --> 2:33:44.660
 I'll just get like too lost in the weeds of shitty things I did in the past.

2:33:44.660 --> 2:33:47.980
 So speaking of Victor Franco, you and Hitler have the same birthday.

2:33:47.980 --> 2:33:48.980
 Oh my God.

2:33:48.980 --> 2:33:50.980
 You've really done your research.

2:33:50.980 --> 2:33:59.020
 Well, I often Google famous people that have a birthday, same as Hitler.

2:33:59.020 --> 2:34:04.780
 And the person that shows up, you know, is your face just really big.

2:34:04.780 --> 2:34:08.020
 You and Hitler together, just the pals next to each other.

2:34:08.020 --> 2:34:09.500
 No, it does not.

2:34:09.500 --> 2:34:14.700
 No, but April 20th is an embarrassing birthday for all my 420 friends out there.

2:34:14.700 --> 2:34:15.700
 It's embarrassing.

2:34:15.700 --> 2:34:17.060
 You share a birthday with Hitler.

2:34:17.060 --> 2:34:23.220
 Well, it's 420s also has a humor and a lightness to it, right?

2:34:23.220 --> 2:34:24.220
 It's embarrassing.

2:34:24.220 --> 2:34:27.340
 Especially if life is embarrassing.

2:34:27.340 --> 2:34:34.260
 But if you like weed and you're born on stoner day and you believe in reincarnation, do you

2:34:34.260 --> 2:34:38.420
 realize like when you start connecting the dots there, if there is like a bardo where

2:34:38.420 --> 2:34:41.140
 you get to choose your next life?

2:34:41.140 --> 2:34:45.140
 So you're like a shitty generic NPC.

2:34:45.140 --> 2:34:49.020
 You're like, of course, of course you would be born on 420.

2:34:49.020 --> 2:34:54.060
 Dude, let me be born on 420, man, yeah.

2:34:54.060 --> 2:35:00.140
 But isn't it interesting that on that same day, Hitler is also born?

2:35:00.140 --> 2:35:06.860
 There's a tension to that and that Hitler's an artist.

2:35:06.860 --> 2:35:11.980
 So it's like that hippie mindset could go anywhere.

2:35:11.980 --> 2:35:12.980
 Oh, yeah, right.

2:35:12.980 --> 2:35:18.740
 And I was just having this conversation with a friend of mine who's a wonderful skeptic

2:35:18.740 --> 2:35:28.060
 and we were talking about this, which is the thing where you started attributing to the

2:35:28.060 --> 2:35:32.780
 day you were born, these kind of significance and based on maybe people who were born on

2:35:32.780 --> 2:35:35.060
 that day, maybe some other things.

2:35:35.060 --> 2:35:39.580
 And it's like think of how many people by now in the course of human history have been

2:35:39.580 --> 2:35:42.300
 born on April 20th.

2:35:42.300 --> 2:35:44.380
 I mean, how many?

2:35:44.380 --> 2:35:47.940
 Someone could probably do the math and come up with some number close to it.

2:35:47.940 --> 2:35:52.220
 Now, this is how you know how rotten Hitler is.

2:35:52.220 --> 2:35:57.060
 He's the one that like fucks up the birthday for everybody else.

2:35:57.060 --> 2:36:04.580
 But I think where I heard that you're 420 is Wim Hof episode because he's also 420.

2:36:04.580 --> 2:36:05.580
 He's a 420.

2:36:05.580 --> 2:36:06.580
 Yeah.

2:36:06.580 --> 2:36:11.860
 So Hitler beats even Wim Hof in terms of owning the date.

2:36:11.860 --> 2:36:18.980
 I think if anybody is like, well, obviously there's nothing you could do to like fix it.

2:36:18.980 --> 2:36:20.380
 Hitler fucked up a lot of things.

2:36:20.380 --> 2:36:22.140
 He fucked up that mustache.

2:36:22.140 --> 2:36:23.740
 He fucked up the name Hitler.

2:36:23.740 --> 2:36:25.260
 He fucked up 420.

2:36:25.260 --> 2:36:30.940
 And obviously he caused a horrific Holocaust that, by the way, talk about these reverberations

2:36:30.940 --> 2:36:33.060
 through time that we're still experiencing.

2:36:33.060 --> 2:36:37.940
 There's still people walked around with fucking tattoos from that motherfucker.

2:36:37.940 --> 2:36:45.940
 But Wim Hof, people like Wim Hof, they're like whatever the opposite of Hitler is.

2:36:45.940 --> 2:36:51.380
 He too is creating ripples in the lake that hopefully respond to that of Hitler.

2:36:51.380 --> 2:36:52.380
 Yeah.

2:36:52.380 --> 2:36:53.380
 Very cold fucking lake.

2:36:53.380 --> 2:37:00.060
 And he's in, yeah, so very, very cold lake that he's happily swimming around in.

2:37:00.060 --> 2:37:09.340
 But yeah, I try not to think about the Hitler thing on my birthday that my dad would just

2:37:09.340 --> 2:37:12.180
 every birthday he would remind me that Hitler was born.

2:37:12.180 --> 2:37:14.900
 Do you think all of us are capable of evil?

2:37:14.900 --> 2:37:19.420
 Do you think you're one of the sweetest people I know, just as a fan?

2:37:19.420 --> 2:37:21.540
 Do you think you're capable of evil?

2:37:21.540 --> 2:37:22.540
 Sure.

2:37:22.540 --> 2:37:23.540
 Yeah.

2:37:23.540 --> 2:37:24.540
 I mean, sure.

2:37:24.540 --> 2:37:25.540
 Definitely.

2:37:25.540 --> 2:37:29.940
 I think if you don't think that, you better watch out because come on.

2:37:29.940 --> 2:37:31.660
 How do you think you're not capable of evil?

2:37:31.660 --> 2:37:38.580
 And PS, if you're connected to the supply chain, friend, you're doing evil.

2:37:38.580 --> 2:37:40.820
 You're paying taxes.

2:37:40.820 --> 2:37:44.300
 You're supporting the worst things in the world.

2:37:44.300 --> 2:37:50.460
 You know, like diffusion of responsibility, it's really curious or the circumference of

2:37:50.460 --> 2:37:56.500
 responsibility where it's like bombs are going off somewhere that were paid for in

2:37:56.500 --> 2:38:05.700
 some small part by you, by you, some fractional, if you, if an American, if a drone is flying

2:38:05.700 --> 2:38:13.220
 over a village in Afghanistan and drops a bomb and you pay taxes, then you could say

2:38:13.220 --> 2:38:18.940
 you have fractional ownership over that drone.

2:38:18.940 --> 2:38:22.660
 You're a cog in the machine of evil in some sense.

2:38:22.660 --> 2:38:26.500
 And I know what you're going to say, well, yeah, but I have to fucking pay taxes.

2:38:26.500 --> 2:38:27.500
 Like I have no choice.

2:38:27.500 --> 2:38:29.980
 There's sales tax, there's this or that.

2:38:29.980 --> 2:38:35.940
 Take that attitude, it's the same thing that people on the battlefield, when they're sending

2:38:35.940 --> 2:38:39.100
 missiles into other tanks, they're thinking the same thing.

2:38:39.100 --> 2:38:43.380
 It's just they're more directly responsible for what's going on.

2:38:43.380 --> 2:38:51.460
 But in Buddhism, this idea of dependent coerising, or yeah, dependent coerising, we're all connected.

2:38:51.460 --> 2:38:57.780
 We're all part of this matrix, we're all connected, meaning we all share responsibility for the

2:38:57.780 --> 2:38:58.780
 evil in the world.

2:38:58.780 --> 2:39:04.820
 So even if you aren't directly committing evil acts, if you're seeing something in the

2:39:04.820 --> 2:39:10.580
 world and you're thinking that's evil, you're probably not quite as separated from that

2:39:10.580 --> 2:39:18.220
 as you'd like to believe in some tiny, infinitesimally quantum way.

2:39:18.220 --> 2:39:19.220
 You're connected.

2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:25.300
 And there is the sense, I've gotten to experience this over and over that one individual can

2:39:25.300 --> 2:39:33.500
 actually make a gigantic difference in, and so not only is there a diffusion of responsibility,

2:39:33.500 --> 2:39:37.460
 there's a kind of a paralysis about, well, what can I do?

2:39:37.460 --> 2:39:38.460
 Yeah.

2:39:38.460 --> 2:39:41.060
 Sure, I understand, but what can I do?

2:39:41.060 --> 2:39:50.340
 And I think just looking at history and also hanging out and becoming friends, but also

2:39:50.340 --> 2:39:56.180
 interviewing people that've had a tremendous impact, you realize, you're just one dude.

2:39:56.180 --> 2:40:00.500
 You're like a normal person, you're not that smart even.

2:40:00.500 --> 2:40:06.380
 A lot of people aren't in some kind of magical way where you have a big head that's figuring

2:40:06.380 --> 2:40:07.380
 out everything.

2:40:07.380 --> 2:40:13.820
 No, you just saw problems in the world and you're like, hey, I think I'm going to try

2:40:13.820 --> 2:40:15.140
 to do something about this.

2:40:15.140 --> 2:40:16.140
 Yeah.

2:40:16.140 --> 2:40:21.300
 And you stay focused and dedicated to it for a long period of time and refuse to quit,

2:40:21.300 --> 2:40:25.100
 refuse to listen to people that tell you that this isn't like impossible, here's how

2:40:25.100 --> 2:40:26.260
 others have failed.

2:40:26.260 --> 2:40:27.260
 Yeah.

2:40:27.260 --> 2:40:29.260
 No, I'm going to do it.

2:40:29.260 --> 2:40:30.260
 That's it.

2:40:30.260 --> 2:40:31.260
 That's it.

2:40:31.260 --> 2:40:35.460
 One person, and then you kind of, the thing is when there's one person that keeps pushing

2:40:35.460 --> 2:40:40.420
 forward that way, humans are sticky, other people follow them around.

2:40:40.420 --> 2:40:45.740
 And they're like, I'll help, I'll help, and then the other people help, and then the

2:40:45.740 --> 2:40:49.820
 cool people all gather together because they kind of get excited about this way.

2:40:49.820 --> 2:40:54.620
 Holy shit, we can actually make a difference and they form groups and then all of a sudden

2:40:54.620 --> 2:40:58.300
 there's companies and nations that actually make a gigantic difference.

2:40:58.300 --> 2:40:59.300
 It's interesting.

2:40:59.300 --> 2:41:01.940
 And it all starts with one person often.

2:41:01.940 --> 2:41:02.940
 You know what?

2:41:02.940 --> 2:41:06.220
 If you push back slightly against that, it's never just one person.

2:41:06.220 --> 2:41:11.940
 It's like, nobody ever talks about, at least as far as I'm aware, you never hear about

2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:14.700
 like Buddha's great grandmother.

2:41:14.700 --> 2:41:15.900
 You never hear about that.

2:41:15.900 --> 2:41:16.900
 You never hear about that.

2:41:16.900 --> 2:41:21.900
 But if not for that person, no Buddhism.

2:41:21.900 --> 2:41:28.580
 The people you're talking about, they're the tip of the iceberg that pops up out of the

2:41:28.580 --> 2:41:37.420
 ocean of history and you never see all the little things that helped that happen.

2:41:37.420 --> 2:41:41.460
 And so to me, this is where the real like, how do you help?

2:41:41.460 --> 2:41:43.100
 What's something you can do?

2:41:43.100 --> 2:41:49.100
 Well, you know, recognize that first, that you might not even be aware of how much you're

2:41:49.100 --> 2:41:51.100
 impacting people around you.

2:41:51.100 --> 2:41:56.140
 You might think that you're not, or you might think surely not in a way that makes a big

2:41:56.140 --> 2:42:03.940
 difference, but you have no idea these tipping points and that can lead to the emergence

2:42:03.940 --> 2:42:08.860
 of an Einstein, a Gandhi, a Martin Luther King.

2:42:08.860 --> 2:42:11.900
 We can go on and on, a Dostoevsky or whoever.

2:42:11.900 --> 2:42:16.820
 And so I think that's where, for me, it goes back to tend to the part of the garden you

2:42:16.820 --> 2:42:24.740
 can touch and then, or even deeper than that, intention, just like an, and I'm an idiot.

2:42:24.740 --> 2:42:33.220
 So I need an idiot's intention, which is don't, if you, I heard the Dalai Lama say it.

2:42:33.220 --> 2:42:36.100
 If you can help, help.

2:42:36.100 --> 2:42:39.020
 If you can't help, don't hurt.

2:42:39.020 --> 2:42:47.780
 Simple, basic dummy rules so that you can, if possible, refrain from hurting, which might

2:42:47.780 --> 2:42:51.060
 as well be a form of helping.

2:42:51.060 --> 2:42:56.020
 And the help doesn't have to be this dramatic thing, these little acts of kindness.

2:42:56.020 --> 2:43:03.060
 I don't know, they seem to have, maybe I believe in kind of karma, but they seem to have this,

2:43:03.060 --> 2:43:05.700
 they can have this gigantic ripple effect.

2:43:05.700 --> 2:43:07.940
 I don't know, I don't know why that is.

2:43:07.940 --> 2:43:13.420
 I just, I remember a lot of little acts of kindness that people have done to me.

2:43:13.420 --> 2:43:17.100
 And they, they, what do they do?

2:43:17.100 --> 2:43:23.900
 When they fill me with joy and hope for the future, they give me faith in humanity, that

2:43:23.900 --> 2:43:31.820
 somehow there's a partially dormant desire in our sort of collective intelligence to

2:43:31.820 --> 2:43:38.020
 do good in the world, that most of us want to be good, that want to do good onto the

2:43:38.020 --> 2:43:39.020
 world.

2:43:39.020 --> 2:43:43.980
 They want, there's a kindness that's kind of like begging to get out, you know, and those

2:43:43.980 --> 2:43:48.500
 little acts of kindness do just that, and actually one of the reasons that I love Austin

2:43:48.500 --> 2:43:55.540
 and moved here is realizing, just noticing those little acts of kindness all around me,

2:43:55.540 --> 2:43:59.340
 just for stupid reasons, just people being really nice.

2:43:59.340 --> 2:44:05.820
 It's weird in that, that, that kindness combined with an optimism for the future, it's just

2:44:05.820 --> 2:44:09.780
 it, it's amazing what that can build.

2:44:09.780 --> 2:44:10.780
 Yes.

2:44:10.780 --> 2:44:11.780
 Yes.

2:44:11.780 --> 2:44:12.780
 It's incredible.

2:44:12.780 --> 2:44:17.100
 That's what you're saying, it's like, you know, we, we moved to this great neighborhood

2:44:17.100 --> 2:44:25.380
 and at this point, I think three, maybe four of our neighbors have like made food for us

2:44:25.380 --> 2:44:31.620
 that just shows up with like handwritten lists of like things they like to do in the area

2:44:31.620 --> 2:44:34.180
 and their phone number, if we need help.

2:44:34.180 --> 2:44:40.860
 And it's like, holy shit, that's like that, it might seem like a little act, but it feels

2:44:40.860 --> 2:44:45.940
 like some kind of atomic love bomb just went off on your porch when you're looking at that

2:44:45.940 --> 2:44:48.180
 and like, what the fuck?

2:44:48.180 --> 2:44:50.820
 You made me a pie.

2:44:50.820 --> 2:44:51.820
 This is incredible.

2:44:51.820 --> 2:44:53.020
 Like this is incredible.

2:44:53.020 --> 2:44:59.580
 So, and also it's another act to accept that kindness with a, it's, it's like a lot of times

2:44:59.580 --> 2:45:04.780
 when I was like in Boston or San Francisco, certain big cities, you can think like, oh,

2:45:04.780 --> 2:45:10.140
 okay, well they're trying to like somehow, that's not an act of kindness.

2:45:10.140 --> 2:45:15.220
 It's some kind of a transactional thing to build up a, it's like a career move for networking,

2:45:15.220 --> 2:45:16.220
 all that kind of stuff.

2:45:16.220 --> 2:45:21.140
 But no, if you just accept it for what it is, a pure act of kindness, fucking Boston.

2:45:21.140 --> 2:45:22.140
 Yeah.

2:45:22.140 --> 2:45:23.140
 Yeah.

2:45:23.140 --> 2:45:26.540
 Because for me, I go the opposite route because I'm not, even though there is a part of me

2:45:26.540 --> 2:45:32.900
 that might be a little suspicious or something, where I go to push that shit back mentally

2:45:32.900 --> 2:45:34.940
 is I'm like, I don't deserve this.

2:45:34.940 --> 2:45:39.500
 If they knew what a piece of shit I am, you're gonna bring me, I don't ever bring cakes to

2:45:39.500 --> 2:45:40.500
 my neighbors.

2:45:40.500 --> 2:45:41.740
 I would know how to make a cake.

2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:42.740
 I don't know how to make anything.

2:45:42.740 --> 2:45:43.740
 I don't have time.

2:45:43.740 --> 2:45:45.460
 I should be bringing shit to my neighbors.

2:45:45.460 --> 2:45:46.460
 Why didn't I do that?

2:45:46.460 --> 2:45:48.660
 I should have brought, I never do that.

2:45:48.660 --> 2:45:54.700
 If you're not careful, you can spiral into a vortex of self hate from the gifts, so you

2:45:54.700 --> 2:45:59.580
 have to, yeah, you have to learn how to, in that circuitry, you have to learn how to like

2:45:59.580 --> 2:46:00.580
 accept.

2:46:00.580 --> 2:46:01.580
 Oh yeah.

2:46:01.580 --> 2:46:08.420
 I have that problem really big, yeah, like, I don't deserve this, like I don't, I get

2:46:08.420 --> 2:46:09.980
 so much love from people.

2:46:09.980 --> 2:46:13.700
 I'm like, well, yeah, they love me because they don't know me.

2:46:13.700 --> 2:46:21.100
 That's my brain, my little voice, like, you're not, you're not worthy, you're not worthy

2:46:21.100 --> 2:46:27.540
 of any of this kindness and all this kind of stuff, and that could be very, yeah, it

2:46:27.540 --> 2:46:28.540
 can shut you down.

2:46:28.540 --> 2:46:30.380
 It could be debilitating.

2:46:30.380 --> 2:46:32.060
 And also it shuts the person down.

2:46:32.060 --> 2:46:33.060
 I mean, you're talking.

2:46:33.060 --> 2:46:34.060
 Yeah.

2:46:34.060 --> 2:46:36.140
 And that's the dog size that pushes them away too.

2:46:36.140 --> 2:46:37.140
 Yeah.

2:46:37.140 --> 2:46:43.140
 You have this fucking mystical circuitry, so like, the best thing, if that happens to

2:46:43.140 --> 2:46:49.940
 you, is like, accept it joyfully, and just even, just all that, whatever that thing inside

2:46:49.940 --> 2:46:54.580
 of you, whatever that little thing is, you know, this is like, and then the meditation

2:46:54.580 --> 2:47:02.920
 I do, it's an infuriatingly simple meditation, but when a thought emerges, when you're arresting

2:47:02.920 --> 2:47:07.300
 your attention on your breath and then inevitably you think, you get lost in your thoughts,

2:47:07.300 --> 2:47:12.660
 and when you catch yourself doing that, you think thinking, and then return your attention

2:47:12.660 --> 2:47:13.660
 to the breath.

2:47:13.660 --> 2:47:18.180
 So I like that, so that when that part of myself starts, you know, having its little

2:47:18.180 --> 2:47:24.220
 neurotic semi seizure, I can just go thinking, whatever, it's just another thought, and then

2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:28.980
 eat the, eat the, eat the banana bread or whatever they gave you.

2:47:28.980 --> 2:47:34.260
 That's the most wild psychedelic experience you've ever had in a dream, in a vision.

2:47:34.260 --> 2:47:36.860
 It doesn't have to be a drug related.

2:47:36.860 --> 2:47:42.820
 What's one that jumps to mind that was like, holy shit, I'm happy to be alive.

2:47:42.820 --> 2:47:43.820
 Is this life?

2:47:43.820 --> 2:47:44.820
 Okay.

2:47:44.820 --> 2:47:45.820
 This is amazing.

2:47:45.820 --> 2:47:46.820
 Yeah.

2:47:46.820 --> 2:47:47.820
 Yeah.

2:47:47.820 --> 2:47:54.260
 Okay, so the one that pops to mind, I've had a lot of psychedelic experiences, but in

2:47:54.260 --> 2:47:57.860
 this moment, the one that pops to mind only because it goes back to what you're talking

2:47:57.860 --> 2:48:05.300
 about, about this Nietzsche's idea of infinite return.

2:48:05.300 --> 2:48:13.420
 So I'm a burning man, and I'm not, I mean, I have kids right now, I just want to be around

2:48:13.420 --> 2:48:14.420
 them.

2:48:14.420 --> 2:48:16.780
 My wife was being so cool about it, and she knows I love burning man.

2:48:16.780 --> 2:48:20.380
 She's like, go to burning man, and I was going to go, and then I'm, I just, I just want to

2:48:20.380 --> 2:48:25.420
 be around my kids as much as I can right now, but I've never been to burning man.

2:48:25.420 --> 2:48:31.540
 So I don't know how secretive it is that, I mean, cause quite high profile folks go.

2:48:31.540 --> 2:48:32.540
 Yeah.

2:48:32.540 --> 2:48:34.180
 Everyone knows Elon Musk goes there.

2:48:34.180 --> 2:48:35.180
 Isn't it pretty open?

2:48:35.180 --> 2:48:37.340
 He's got a boat.

2:48:37.340 --> 2:48:38.340
 You know that?

2:48:38.340 --> 2:48:39.700
 I'm touching none of this.

2:48:39.700 --> 2:48:41.140
 You know, there's a, it's called art cars.

2:48:41.140 --> 2:48:42.380
 They all make art cars.

2:48:42.380 --> 2:48:48.180
 And like part of the, part of the burn, what's so beautiful about it is like, you can't buy

2:48:48.180 --> 2:48:49.420
 anything there, man.

2:48:49.420 --> 2:48:53.820
 Like you, I heard, I don't know if this has changed.

2:48:53.820 --> 2:48:59.540
 It's been a bit because of the pandemic, but the only thing you could buy was ice and coffee.

2:48:59.540 --> 2:49:01.260
 And I think maybe that's changed.

2:49:01.260 --> 2:49:07.300
 I heard some whisper that that's changed, but so that means that it's a gifting economy

2:49:07.300 --> 2:49:08.300
 is what they call it.

2:49:08.300 --> 2:49:13.300
 And so people will just give you stuff, talk about having to struggle with deserving stuff,

2:49:13.300 --> 2:49:14.300
 man.

2:49:14.300 --> 2:49:18.900
 What are you going to fucking do when the camp next to you is like every morning making

2:49:18.900 --> 2:49:23.740
 the best iced coffee that you've ever had in your life and they just, you're giving it

2:49:23.740 --> 2:49:25.980
 all away till it's all gone.

2:49:25.980 --> 2:49:27.980
 What are you going to do?

2:49:27.980 --> 2:49:30.180
 It's the best ever.

2:49:30.180 --> 2:49:31.700
 And then you're giving things to people.

2:49:31.700 --> 2:49:36.980
 And then you, you learn stuff like you learn these really interesting lessons.

2:49:36.980 --> 2:49:45.260
 Like a, one of the times I went there, got all these strawberries looks might not sound

2:49:45.260 --> 2:49:46.260
 like a big deal.

2:49:46.260 --> 2:49:50.900
 But when you're out there in the dust and you're not at one of like the like hardcore

2:49:50.900 --> 2:49:57.340
 like luxury camps, which do exist out there, you know, you've got these like items where

2:49:57.340 --> 2:50:02.060
 in my mind I'm like, yeah, these are going to be just for me and my girlfriend, my special

2:50:02.060 --> 2:50:05.020
 stash fruit and this or that.

2:50:05.020 --> 2:50:11.540
 And then like two days in, you're walking around your camp with the strawberries that

2:50:11.540 --> 2:50:16.420
 you were coveting and everyone's so happy to get like cold strawberries.

2:50:16.420 --> 2:50:21.420
 And you've realized, oh my God, this feels so much better than the way a strawberry tastes.

2:50:21.420 --> 2:50:27.260
 So you learn something experientially there, which is an incredible thing.

2:50:27.260 --> 2:50:28.740
 It's an incredible thing.

2:50:28.740 --> 2:50:31.900
 Man, now I'm wishing I decided to go to Burning Man.

2:50:31.900 --> 2:50:33.060
 Have you been in a few times?

2:50:33.060 --> 2:50:34.060
 Yeah.

2:50:34.060 --> 2:50:38.900
 I just know like, at least people were saying it was Elon Musk's boat.

2:50:38.900 --> 2:50:39.900
 Like, yeah, like this.

2:50:39.900 --> 2:50:43.660
 I think it was like, it's like this massive, it's art cars.

2:50:43.660 --> 2:50:45.260
 And it was this party on this thing.

2:50:45.260 --> 2:50:50.980
 You could just, anyone can go on the boat like no one's like, there's no guest list.

2:50:50.980 --> 2:50:52.180
 You just go on there.

2:50:52.180 --> 2:50:56.540
 I never saw him there, but that, you know, everyone's whispering Elon Musk is here.

2:50:56.540 --> 2:50:57.540
 There's a secrecy.

2:50:57.540 --> 2:50:59.780
 There's all that kind of stuff because you probably have to respect that.

2:50:59.780 --> 2:51:06.660
 But at the same time, there, it seems like the kind of people that go there, I mean,

2:51:06.660 --> 2:51:17.220
 the rules of the outside world are suspended in the sense that the, the crime, the aggression,

2:51:17.220 --> 2:51:20.060
 the tensions, all of that seems to dissipate somehow.

2:51:20.060 --> 2:51:21.540
 Not all the way.

2:51:21.540 --> 2:51:22.540
 Not all the way.

2:51:22.540 --> 2:51:27.180
 That, you know, there's a low, you could look it up, you know, because like there is tension.

2:51:27.180 --> 2:51:33.780
 There's a lot of tension there between, it's called plug and plays, like, you know, Burning

2:51:33.780 --> 2:51:36.940
 Man, like the history of Burning Man is fascinating.

2:51:36.940 --> 2:51:44.580
 It has its roots in the Cacophony Society is what it was called, which is a sort of evolution

2:51:44.580 --> 2:51:50.940
 of something that was, I think it was called the God, like the San Francisco.

2:51:50.940 --> 2:51:55.180
 Basically there was like an art movement in San Francisco and I can't remember the name

2:51:55.180 --> 2:52:02.220
 of it, maybe the suicide club or essentially like they were really into urban exploration

2:52:02.220 --> 2:52:07.940
 and meaning like breaking into like old abandoned buildings and stuff.

2:52:07.940 --> 2:52:16.740
 But part of this, what this was, was you would prepare your life as though you were going

2:52:16.740 --> 2:52:21.660
 to kill yourself, you would get all your affairs in order, you would get, so it's going back

2:52:21.660 --> 2:52:25.620
 to what we were talking about with the cancer diagnosis, you're like sort of putting yourself

2:52:25.620 --> 2:52:30.100
 into that world of like, I'm going to get all my affairs together as though this is

2:52:30.100 --> 2:52:33.860
 it and then there was some, I'm sorry for anyone listening if I'm butchering this, but

2:52:33.860 --> 2:52:37.940
 I think there was some really cool initiation where they would blindfold you and they would

2:52:37.940 --> 2:52:42.020
 take you into some of these abandoned buildings and you didn't know where you were walking,

2:52:42.020 --> 2:52:47.220
 but they would say like, if you take one step to the left, you're going to die, you're going

2:52:47.220 --> 2:52:50.220
 to fall, you're going to fall, so please be careful.

2:52:50.220 --> 2:52:55.780
 So you're like in the moment and then blindfold comes off, it's a big awesome party.

2:52:55.780 --> 2:53:00.140
 This evolves into something called the Cacophony Society, there's a great book called Tales

2:53:00.140 --> 2:53:04.260
 of the Cacophony Society for people listening.

2:53:04.260 --> 2:53:10.660
 One of the members of the Cacophony Society was the author of Fight Club, and so if you've

2:53:10.660 --> 2:53:14.980
 seen Fight Club, like you could see little ideas that were in the Cacophony Society,

2:53:14.980 --> 2:53:22.020
 they were into dadaism, which I don't know a lot about, like I don't know, it's a philosophical

2:53:22.020 --> 2:53:29.100
 art movement, and then so basically what was happening is like they kept burning increasingly

2:53:29.100 --> 2:53:34.700
 large effigies in San Francisco, and they weren't allowed to do it, and so they took

2:53:34.700 --> 2:53:40.820
 it out in the desert, and they were basing it on something called a zone trip, which

2:53:40.820 --> 2:53:48.100
 is like across this border, the rules of that old society are gone, and so that was the

2:53:48.100 --> 2:53:57.740
 original Burning Man, which was these lunatics out in the desert launching like burning pianos

2:53:57.740 --> 2:54:06.620
 out of catapults, through the air doing like drive by shooting ranges, like no rules, wild,

2:54:06.620 --> 2:54:14.780
 magical, beautiful, insane madness, and then it grew and grew and grew and grew until you

2:54:14.780 --> 2:54:19.980
 have Burning Man as it is today, which is still the most incredible thing, I mean obviously

2:54:19.980 --> 2:54:24.340
 anytime you have like a thing that's been around for a while, you're gonna get that

2:54:24.340 --> 2:54:28.740
 it's not like it used to be, it's not as free as it used to be, so this or that, but what's

2:54:28.740 --> 2:54:36.060
 fascinating about Burning Man, someone pointed this out to me, look on the ground, no trash,

2:54:36.060 --> 2:54:43.180
 no cigarettes, the ethic of like picking up your shit there is like so intense, so it's

2:54:43.180 --> 2:54:47.220
 not like the other festivals you go to where there's just trash everywhere, shit scattered

2:54:47.220 --> 2:54:53.780
 everywhere, it's clean, people are picking up their stuff, people are like really being

2:54:53.780 --> 2:54:58.900
 conscious of like not fucking up the playa, so I'm sorry, don't get up and you don't

2:54:58.900 --> 2:55:04.020
 get a burner yapping about Burning Man, we won't stop, it'll be morning, but there's

2:55:04.020 --> 2:55:09.900
 a power there, but there is a power to culture propagating itself through to the stories

2:55:09.900 --> 2:55:15.580
 that we tell each other and that holds up for Burning Man, it's clear that the culture

2:55:15.580 --> 2:55:21.300
 has stayed strong throughout the years, there's so many people, so many really interesting

2:55:21.300 --> 2:55:30.180
 people speak of Burning Man as like a sacred place they go to, to remind themselves about

2:55:30.180 --> 2:55:32.660
 what's important, that's so interesting.

2:55:32.660 --> 2:55:36.860
 And it is, and it is, I mean it's like, you know there are all these stories of like,

2:55:36.860 --> 2:55:42.300
 I love guru stories, I have a guru, Neem Karoli Baba, never met him, he was Ram Das's guru,

2:55:42.300 --> 2:55:47.100
 at least not in the flesh, but the story of the guru is if you're lucky you meet this

2:55:47.100 --> 2:55:53.460
 being that, and we're not talking about you know whatever the run of the mill like charlatans

2:55:53.460 --> 2:56:04.100
 out there, like I know for sure that people are in the world right now who, when you're

2:56:04.100 --> 2:56:09.860
 around them, you, the thing you're talking about, the affirmation of the potential of

2:56:09.860 --> 2:56:15.340
 humanity and also just an acceptance of yourself and you know cultivate, like seeing someone

2:56:15.340 --> 2:56:24.620
 who's cultivated love or compassion or whatever, but in this way that is, I mean you would

2:56:24.620 --> 2:56:30.740
 almost, you would rather meet that being than like a UFO land in your backyard, it's like

2:56:30.740 --> 2:56:36.940
 it is the UFO, it's a person but it's not, it's everybody and nobody and somehow they

2:56:36.940 --> 2:56:45.260
 like end up conveying to you ideas that you may have heard a million times before, but

2:56:45.260 --> 2:56:53.140
 somehow within the language itself is a transmission that permanently alters you, and so these

2:56:53.140 --> 2:57:02.180
 people exist, I think you could argue that Burning Man, the total thing is a guru, that

2:57:02.180 --> 2:57:08.500
 a pilgrimage is involved to get there, you, like it's not easy to get there, and when

2:57:08.500 --> 2:57:14.620
 you get there, it's gonna teach you something, it's gonna show you something, it's going

2:57:14.620 --> 2:57:21.340
 to, and know what maybe some of the stuff it shows you might not be great, but the community

2:57:21.340 --> 2:57:28.700
 around you will like, will hold you as you're like whatever the thing is that's coming

2:57:28.700 --> 2:57:30.180
 out of you, it's coming out of you.

2:57:30.180 --> 2:57:36.540
 And even the simplest activities, the simplest exchange of words have like just like the

2:57:36.540 --> 2:57:42.620
 gurus of a profound impact somehow, something about that place.

2:57:42.620 --> 2:57:49.260
 Yeah, not to mention the insane synchronicities, like insane synchronicities there, and I think

2:57:49.260 --> 2:57:56.700
 like, you know, to get back to the notion of sentience as a byproduct of a harmonized

2:57:56.700 --> 2:58:03.780
 yet hypercomplex system, I think synchronicities like those kinds of systems are like lightning

2:58:03.780 --> 2:58:11.580
 rods for synchronicity, so crazy, not just because your high synchronicities happen that

2:58:11.580 --> 2:58:17.140
 are impossible, where you just have to deal with it, and like you'll need something and

2:58:17.140 --> 2:58:20.460
 within a few minutes, someone's like, oh, here you go.

2:58:20.460 --> 2:58:25.940
 And you mentioned, by the way, Burning Man because of a psychedelic experience, is it

2:58:25.940 --> 2:58:28.820
 the strawberries or was it something else?

2:58:28.820 --> 2:58:29.820
 No.

2:58:29.820 --> 2:58:30.820
 What was the moment?

2:58:30.820 --> 2:58:31.820
 Yeah, that was magical.

2:58:31.820 --> 2:58:32.820
 No, it was DMT.

2:58:32.820 --> 2:58:33.820
 It wasn't strawberries.

2:58:33.820 --> 2:58:34.820
 No, I was more potent.

2:58:34.820 --> 2:58:54.140
 Yeah, I was like smoking DMT, and like, I saw, like, if you, in the Midnight Gospel,

2:58:54.140 --> 2:58:59.740
 there are these bovine creatures that have like a long neck and a lantern head, so like,

2:58:59.740 --> 2:59:11.100
 I saw one of those things, and, you know, I thought it was funny and like ridiculous

2:59:11.100 --> 2:59:16.460
 because you hear like all the Terrence McKenna stories of the self transforming machine elves

2:59:16.460 --> 2:59:22.540
 or all the purple or the magenta goddess everyone sees, so I'm like, so this is what

2:59:22.540 --> 2:59:23.540
 I get?

2:59:23.540 --> 2:59:28.980
 Like a fucking cow with a lantern head, like that's where my brain is at and interacting

2:59:28.980 --> 2:59:39.980
 with this molecule, so then, like, I look away, and again, this is DMT, so when I say

2:59:39.980 --> 2:59:44.380
 look away, do I mean, with my eyes shut, I look away, or eyes open, I look away, I think

2:59:44.380 --> 2:59:50.780
 eyes shut, so it sounds weird to say look away, but however you want to put it, that's

2:59:50.780 --> 2:59:56.340
 what I did, and I look back, and it's still there, only now it's, you know, because usually

2:59:56.340 --> 3:00:01.580
 in like, when you're having those kinds of visions, they go away pretty quickly, things

3:00:01.580 --> 3:00:08.540
 like moved like shambled ahead, maybe a few steps, just like a cow, just like a cow, and

3:00:08.540 --> 3:00:13.820
 then that was when the, you know, all the stories you hear about it, like going through

3:00:13.820 --> 3:00:20.900
 some kind of tuber, some kind of light tunnel, like a water slide made of light, or that's

3:00:20.900 --> 3:00:25.460
 increasingly familiar, that's the wildest part of it, it's like, oh, I know this place,

3:00:25.460 --> 3:00:30.620
 not like, oh, I've seen this in like, you know, on like bong stickers, but like, oh,

3:00:30.620 --> 3:00:37.580
 yeah, this is that place you gotta do, you just remember, oh, this place, and then, it

3:00:37.580 --> 3:00:44.580
 was like I was in some kind of, I don't know how to put it, a chamber, a technological chamber,

3:00:44.580 --> 3:00:50.660
 some kind of supercomputer, some kind of nucleus that was technological, and it was inviting,

3:00:50.660 --> 3:00:58.100
 there was an invitation of like, come in, like come deeper into, come deeper in, and you

3:00:58.100 --> 3:01:02.940
 can talk to whatever it is over there, you don't talk, but there's a communication, and

3:01:02.940 --> 3:01:09.780
 I communicated, but my friends, I don't, I love my friends, I guess I had some sense

3:01:09.780 --> 3:01:16.500
 in that moment that it would mean complete obliteration, or who knows what, and the response

3:01:16.500 --> 3:01:22.140
 that it gave back was, you can always go back there, and that's when I open my eyes, I'm

3:01:22.140 --> 3:01:29.100
 back, totally, you know, and ever since then, that's caused me to revise my thinking on

3:01:29.100 --> 3:01:34.900
 reincarnation, the idea that you die and you start as a baby, and then live your life again,

3:01:34.900 --> 3:01:39.980
 it goes right into what we were talking about, you know, that maybe data, you know, that the

3:01:39.980 --> 3:01:44.580
 shit I saw in nitrous oxide, I feel dumb that my epiphanies are all related to drugs, but

3:01:44.580 --> 3:01:53.260
 not all of them are, a lot of them, but this notion of like, oh, is it that we're imprinting

3:01:53.260 --> 3:02:01.260
 into the medium of time space every thing we do, and that that is a permanent imprint,

3:02:01.260 --> 3:02:10.260
 a frame, that upon death can be accessed in the same way we can pull up pictures on our

3:02:10.260 --> 3:02:18.500
 phone or computers, and not only accessed, but experienced, as though, in other words,

3:02:18.500 --> 3:02:22.500
 you could just jump in, you're still going to have your memories, it's going to give

3:02:22.500 --> 3:02:29.420
 you a, the illusion of having been a kid and gotten to that frame, but no, you just decided

3:02:29.420 --> 3:02:36.740
 to go back there, nostalgia, whatever, and yeah, you can jump around freely in space

3:02:36.740 --> 3:02:37.740
 and time.

3:02:37.740 --> 3:02:41.220
 Yeah, you can go in and out of time space, but when you, the problem is, when you go

3:02:41.220 --> 3:02:45.900
 into time space, it's time, so it's going to feel sticky, it's going to feel like you've

3:02:45.900 --> 3:02:51.740
 been here forever because you've dropped back onto the track that Nietzsche's talking about,

3:02:51.740 --> 3:02:58.580
 and I guess one of the qualities of dropping into that frame is that you forget your higher,

3:02:58.580 --> 3:03:01.060
 higher dimensional identity.

3:03:01.060 --> 3:03:04.980
 What happened to the cow with the lantern?

3:03:04.980 --> 3:03:06.980
 Was that goodbye?

3:03:06.980 --> 3:03:14.660
 He writes me letters sometimes, never saw it again, never saw it again, but I put it

3:03:14.660 --> 3:03:20.140
 in, we put it in the Midnight Gospel, you know, I, like Pendleton was like, it's such

3:03:20.140 --> 3:03:24.540
 a genius, and he was, he drew it for me, and then it just ended up as a part of the show.

3:03:24.540 --> 3:03:29.300
 But by the way, I have to admit that as a big fan of yours, I haven't watched the Midnight

3:03:29.300 --> 3:03:35.340
 Gospel because I've been waiting, it sounds, he's do these stupid things, but ever since

3:03:35.340 --> 3:03:41.660
 you talked to, maybe two years ago with Joe about it, I've been waiting to do, to watch

3:03:41.660 --> 3:03:47.180
 it with like a special person on mushrooms, that's been in my to do, I don't know, of

3:03:47.180 --> 3:03:51.500
 course you don't have to be on mushrooms to enjoy it, but for some reason I put it into

3:03:51.500 --> 3:03:56.060
 my head that this is something I want to do with somebody else, like experience it and

3:03:56.060 --> 3:04:01.420
 get in the wild, because visually, I mean, I watched a bunch of it just a little bit

3:04:01.420 --> 3:04:07.740
 here and there, but it's just visually such an interesting experience, combined with

3:04:07.740 --> 3:04:15.260
 everything else, obviously the ideas, the voices and so on, but just visually it's like,

3:04:15.260 --> 3:04:20.020
 it's like a super psychedelic version of Rick and Morty or something like that, like, you

3:04:20.020 --> 3:04:23.260
 know, like farther out, while they're out there, so.

3:04:23.260 --> 3:04:29.300
 Yeah man, that's Pendleton, you know, these are, these people, I mean like, I was part

3:04:29.300 --> 3:04:36.260
 of that, in the sense that like Pendleton gave every, like one of the reasons he's like

3:04:36.260 --> 3:04:41.140
 such a genius and great at making stuff is like, he's like, he really does a good job

3:04:41.140 --> 3:04:47.780
 of just like, dehierchizing potential like hierarchies that can appear, you know, someone

3:04:47.780 --> 3:04:54.180
 has to be like, driving the bus, and that was Pendleton, but he lets, he's so inclusive,

3:04:54.180 --> 3:04:59.500
 there's a real punk rock thing that he's doing, which is like, he'll take everything and it

3:04:59.500 --> 3:05:07.180
 kind of mixes its way into the show, but one of the things, you know, in, in, in animation,

3:05:07.180 --> 3:05:14.900
 it can get really strict with like, drawing the characters and like, the, like, trying

3:05:14.900 --> 3:05:21.260
 to create continuity in the way the character looks, like, and it can get really brute for

3:05:21.260 --> 3:05:27.060
 the animator, it can get brutally precise, like it has to be precise, but he figured

3:05:27.060 --> 3:05:33.220
 out that if you just sort of, it's not like obviously like Clancy had to look like Clancy

3:05:33.220 --> 3:05:37.700
 through the whole show, but if you allow the various people animating it to sort of have

3:05:37.700 --> 3:05:44.220
 their own spin on it, then suddenly it creates a very psychedelic, you know, the show looks

3:05:44.220 --> 3:05:49.100
 more psychedelic because it looks more organic, and also the amount of time, I had no idea,

3:05:49.100 --> 3:05:58.940
 the amount of time that goes into making digital art look like that is, it's insane, the amount

3:05:58.940 --> 3:06:04.060
 of work and comping that stuff is just crazy.

3:06:04.060 --> 3:06:05.060
 It's crazy.

3:06:05.060 --> 3:06:10.540
 Well, generally the amount of time it takes, even just like a painting, when you, I really

3:06:10.540 --> 3:06:15.500
 enjoy watching like artists do a time lapse, and you realize how much effort just into

3:06:15.500 --> 3:06:21.500
 a single image goes into it, you know, hours and hours and hours, sometimes days, sometimes

3:06:21.500 --> 3:06:26.620
 weeks and months, and then you just get to see them work, but they lose themselves in

3:06:26.620 --> 3:06:32.260
 the craftsmanship of it, and the rhythm of it, and like, because they're focused on the,

3:06:32.260 --> 3:06:36.300
 so we were talking about robotics earlier, like on the little details, like, they're

3:06:36.300 --> 3:06:41.300
 never looked, well, most of the time isn't spent looking at the big picture of the final

3:06:41.300 --> 3:06:45.940
 result, it's looking at the little details there and so on, and there, but they're nevertheless

3:06:45.940 --> 3:06:50.540
 able to somehow constantly channel the big picture of the final result.

3:06:50.540 --> 3:06:51.540
 My God.

3:06:51.540 --> 3:06:52.540
 Yeah.

3:06:52.540 --> 3:06:58.900
 The respect I have for animators, it's like, dear God, it's the craziest thing when you

3:06:58.900 --> 3:07:03.940
 watch it, when you see what it looks like, and how much time goes into it, and how zen

3:07:03.940 --> 3:07:07.380
 they have to be, because like, no matter what, you're going to have to cut stuff, man.

3:07:07.380 --> 3:07:12.060
 And when you're cutting like a few seconds of animation, that was someone's like month,

3:07:12.060 --> 3:07:19.260
 maybe, you know, and like, they understand, but still it's like, whoa, it's brutal.

3:07:19.260 --> 3:07:26.500
 And so they have like this zen outlook on it, which is really cool.

3:07:26.500 --> 3:07:29.220
 And they watch podcasts, that's the other cool thing, when you realize like, they're

3:07:29.220 --> 3:07:34.500
 listening to podcasts, they're like, that's really cool to see that aspect of it too,

3:07:34.500 --> 3:07:36.620
 but yeah, man, I, you know.

3:07:36.620 --> 3:07:37.620
 Yeah.

3:07:37.620 --> 3:07:39.980
 Your voice is in the ears of a lot of interesting people.

3:07:39.980 --> 3:07:40.980
 It's not.

3:07:40.980 --> 3:07:41.980
 Wars too.

3:07:41.980 --> 3:07:42.980
 And I, you know.

3:07:42.980 --> 3:07:43.980
 Hello, interesting person.

3:07:43.980 --> 3:07:46.980
 Hello, CIA animators.

3:07:46.980 --> 3:07:48.900
 Eating delicious food in the cafeteria.

3:07:48.900 --> 3:07:49.900
 Yeah.

3:07:49.900 --> 3:07:50.900
 I'm on your side.

3:07:50.900 --> 3:07:51.900
 He's against you.

3:07:51.900 --> 3:07:52.900
 I'm with you.

3:07:52.900 --> 3:07:53.900
 Yeah.

3:07:53.900 --> 3:07:57.020
 Do you have, you have a beard, therefore you must be wise.

3:07:57.020 --> 3:08:04.300
 Do you have advice for young people, high school, college, about how to carve their path

3:08:04.300 --> 3:08:05.300
 through life?

3:08:05.300 --> 3:08:12.100
 I don't have a life, a career that's successful that they can be proud of or a life they can

3:08:12.100 --> 3:08:13.100
 be proud of.

3:08:13.100 --> 3:08:20.420
 Man, see, this is what kind of, this is what sucks about my life is that it's been very

3:08:20.420 --> 3:08:23.740
 random and very spontaneous.

3:08:23.740 --> 3:08:28.900
 So unfortunately, I don't get that thing where I could be like, well, here's what I did.

3:08:28.900 --> 3:08:29.900
 Yeah.

3:08:29.900 --> 3:08:35.980
 Like, I don't, like I inherited $12,000 from my grandmother.

3:08:35.980 --> 3:08:37.060
 Here's what you do, kids.

3:08:37.060 --> 3:08:41.700
 You inherit $12,000 when your grandmother dies and then you need to be dumb enough to

3:08:41.700 --> 3:08:46.340
 think that that $12,000 is going to help you live in LA for a year.

3:08:46.340 --> 3:08:53.060
 So then what you do is you move to LA with $12,000 and you find a shitty place that you

3:08:53.060 --> 3:08:58.700
 live at and then you use that money to buy acid and synthesizers and then you run out

3:08:58.700 --> 3:09:05.540
 of the money and then you have to get a job and so then because you think it'll be fun

3:09:05.540 --> 3:09:11.060
 to work at a comedy club, you get a job at the comedy store and then, you know, that's

3:09:11.060 --> 3:09:14.980
 how it happened for me and none of it, there wasn't, I know it was never out of the confidence

3:09:14.980 --> 3:09:18.660
 to be like, I'm going to be a stand up comedian.

3:09:18.660 --> 3:09:19.660
 No way.

3:09:19.660 --> 3:09:23.980
 I just thought it'd be cool to work in that building, I thought the building looked cool.

3:09:23.980 --> 3:09:31.500
 And so, but then because you work at the comedy store, you get stage time, the reason you

3:09:31.500 --> 3:09:36.340
 work there is at least in those days, because it's not like they're paying a shit ton of

3:09:36.340 --> 3:09:39.260
 money for you to answer phones at a comedy club.

3:09:39.260 --> 3:09:46.980
 And so, you know, I started going on stage and then I just got lucky because Rogan saw

3:09:46.980 --> 3:09:50.340
 me have a very rare good set.

3:09:50.340 --> 3:09:54.220
 I didn't know he was in the room or out of bomb, you know, and then like, because he

3:09:54.220 --> 3:09:57.140
 thought I was funny and he liked talking to me, he started taking me on the road with

3:09:57.140 --> 3:09:58.140
 him.

3:09:58.140 --> 3:10:01.660
 And then, you know, so I don't know, man, I think.

3:10:01.660 --> 3:10:07.460
 Was there an element to, there's a beautiful weirdness to you as a human being.

3:10:07.460 --> 3:10:18.420
 Was there like a pressure to conform ever to hide yourself from the world or the $12,000

3:10:18.420 --> 3:10:21.300
 in the ass that give you the confidence you needed to be yourself?

3:10:21.300 --> 3:10:27.340
 Oh, no, I don't like, I still, I know, I think, sure, there's that pressure and like,

3:10:27.340 --> 3:10:31.900
 you know, whenever you're, you're beginning to really differentiate from your parents,

3:10:31.900 --> 3:10:36.980
 but then you go back to hang out with your parents, you'll feel, you can feel that it's

3:10:36.980 --> 3:10:40.660
 not like they even want you to conform, but you'll just, you could slip into that, whatever

3:10:40.660 --> 3:10:41.660
 that was.

3:10:41.660 --> 3:10:47.900
 So I remember that when I would go back and like visit them and stuff and surely conformity

3:10:47.900 --> 3:10:53.620
 or the pressure to like, not be individual or whatever, it's everywhere, man.

3:10:53.620 --> 3:10:56.500
 Do you think you made your parents proud?

3:10:56.500 --> 3:11:10.780
 No, no, no, no, I, well, I think that when my mom died, I felt successful in the sense

3:11:10.780 --> 3:11:19.420
 that I was able to support my, I was, I was making money from doing standup in my, I didn't

3:11:19.420 --> 3:11:20.420
 need help.

3:11:20.420 --> 3:11:24.980
 I was like, I was supporting myself with art and doing good, what I thought was great then.

3:11:24.980 --> 3:11:31.660
 So, and I think she like, because she had witnessed me literally failing, I mean, which

3:11:31.660 --> 3:11:37.300
 is by the way, I think part of, if you want to be an artist or successful, you're, you

3:11:37.300 --> 3:11:45.980
 kind of have to fail, like there, if, if, and if there was a guaranteed route from sucking

3:11:45.980 --> 3:11:55.220
 to not sucking or from like the neophyte phase of whatever the art form is and, you know,

3:11:55.220 --> 3:12:00.020
 some intermediary phase, then I think a lot more people would do it, but there really

3:12:00.020 --> 3:12:03.300
 is no guarantees in it, especially the standup comedy.

3:12:03.300 --> 3:12:08.020
 It's like, you'd have to be a maniac to want to, to think that that's going to work out

3:12:08.020 --> 3:12:09.020
 for you.

3:12:09.020 --> 3:12:16.460
 You have to, so you're going to, there are obviously exceptions, but for me, it was like

3:12:16.460 --> 3:12:21.020
 a long slog, you know, and that's scary for a mom.

3:12:21.020 --> 3:12:29.420
 So, but that being said, when she was dying, like she did recognize that I was like not

3:12:29.420 --> 3:12:38.420
 slogging anymore, and she did say, she said, you did it, and that's cool, but in, you know,

3:12:38.420 --> 3:12:42.780
 I would love for her to see me now, like now I'd be way cooler, but maybe she does.

3:12:42.780 --> 3:12:43.780
 I don't know.

3:12:43.780 --> 3:12:48.780
 She's listening to your podcast elsewhere and the other, and the, in the bardo.

3:12:48.780 --> 3:12:49.780
 Yeah.

3:12:49.780 --> 3:12:50.780
 Yeah.

3:12:50.780 --> 3:12:55.340
 However, long that lasts, reconfiguring the whole process to start again.

3:12:55.340 --> 3:12:59.660
 Um, you as a father know, how did that change you?

3:12:59.660 --> 3:13:00.660
 Yeah.

3:13:00.660 --> 3:13:02.380
 That's the big change, man.

3:13:02.380 --> 3:13:03.380
 That's the thing.

3:13:03.380 --> 3:13:05.860
 You made, you made a few biological entities.

3:13:05.860 --> 3:13:06.860
 I reproduce.

3:13:06.860 --> 3:13:07.860
 Yeah.

3:13:07.860 --> 3:13:08.860
 I made biological entities.

3:13:08.860 --> 3:13:10.420
 I mean, I came in my wife.

3:13:10.420 --> 3:13:11.420
 Let's face it.

3:13:11.420 --> 3:13:16.100
 Like I would love to say I made them, but the womb whipped them up.

3:13:16.100 --> 3:13:19.020
 But it is the, yeah, it's the best.

3:13:19.020 --> 3:13:22.540
 It's, I've never experienced anything like it before.

3:13:22.540 --> 3:13:28.100
 It is the, as far as I'm concerned, the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.

3:13:28.100 --> 3:13:33.180
 And that's why I was able to answer your Nietzsche question with like, hell, yes, fuck, yes.

3:13:33.180 --> 3:13:34.180
 That's great.

3:13:34.180 --> 3:13:35.180
 I get to be around my kids again.

3:13:35.180 --> 3:13:36.340
 I'll always be around my kids.

3:13:36.340 --> 3:13:38.500
 I'll always be around my children.

3:13:38.500 --> 3:13:39.500
 That's incredible.

3:13:39.500 --> 3:13:40.500
 That's the joy.

3:13:40.500 --> 3:13:48.980
 So like, so for me, the part of myself that used to torture myself more specific like

3:13:48.980 --> 3:13:54.700
 around like my mom dying, feeling like I wasn't there enough for her, wishing that I had spent

3:13:54.700 --> 3:14:00.220
 more time with her, wishing I'd spent more time with my dad, wishing that like, you know,

3:14:00.220 --> 3:14:05.460
 looking back at like how like I was just so desperately trying to evade the fact that

3:14:05.460 --> 3:14:13.420
 she was dying and through, and in that evasion successfully like distanced myself from her

3:14:13.420 --> 3:14:21.220
 and like in ways that I really wish I hadn't, I'm just saying that because like it's one

3:14:21.220 --> 3:14:22.220
 of my regrets.

3:14:22.220 --> 3:14:23.220
 It's like a big regret.

3:14:23.220 --> 3:14:26.380
 I have a lot of little regrets, but that's a big one.

3:14:26.380 --> 3:14:40.380
 And so when you have kids, you look back at everything you did and you think like, fuck,

3:14:40.380 --> 3:14:45.820
 if I'd gone left at that point instead of right, if I had eaten, who knows?

3:14:45.820 --> 3:14:53.700
 What if I'd eaten like a turkey sandwich when my balls were creating the cum that was going

3:14:53.700 --> 3:14:55.020
 to make my kids?

3:14:55.020 --> 3:14:59.060
 Would I have a different kid with this being not exist in my life?

3:14:59.060 --> 3:15:04.580
 Like you start looking at everything and you realize like, thank God, thank God for every

3:15:04.580 --> 3:15:08.900
 single thing that happened to me because it all led up to this.

3:15:08.900 --> 3:15:21.140
 And oh, for me that is the, it frees you and it liberates you because you realize like,

3:15:21.140 --> 3:15:30.100
 oh wow, it's clumsy and selfish and at times rotten as I've been in my life that did not

3:15:30.100 --> 3:15:38.580
 impede the universe at all from allowing these two beautiful beings to exist in the world.

3:15:38.580 --> 3:15:46.420
 So maybe all of it enabled, all of it like a concert perfectly led up to that little

3:15:46.420 --> 3:15:48.740
 beautiful moment.

3:15:48.740 --> 3:15:52.300
 Is there ways you would like to be a better father?

3:15:52.300 --> 3:15:55.780
 Oh yeah, for sure, absolutely.

3:15:55.780 --> 3:15:59.540
 There's a, there's an actual, I read something in a book.

3:15:59.540 --> 3:16:04.340
 It's called Good Enough, the mantra for a parent, good enough because when you are in

3:16:04.340 --> 3:16:14.580
 the presence of something you love more than you've ever experienced love, you want to

3:16:14.580 --> 3:16:15.580
 be perfect.

3:16:15.580 --> 3:16:17.660
 Like you want to be, I can't, I got to work, man.

3:16:17.660 --> 3:16:18.900
 I got to go on the road.

3:16:18.900 --> 3:16:19.900
 I've got to work.

3:16:19.900 --> 3:16:20.900
 I got to support the family.

3:16:20.900 --> 3:16:24.820
 So that means I have to work like, I work, you know, you know what it's like having a

3:16:24.820 --> 3:16:32.780
 podcast, you fucking work, man, and, you know, it's a full time job because I've, you know,

3:16:32.780 --> 3:16:34.820
 I do stand up too and all the other stuff.

3:16:34.820 --> 3:16:40.740
 So I feel sometimes I feel like, oh my God, I want to spend more time with them.

3:16:40.740 --> 3:16:42.180
 Like I should be spending more time with them.

3:16:42.180 --> 3:16:45.420
 But then also I want to create, I want to work.

3:16:45.420 --> 3:16:49.180
 I like being like the provider.

3:16:49.180 --> 3:16:53.540
 So that's something I feel guilty about, you know, right now.

3:16:53.540 --> 3:16:56.940
 And I'm struggling how to balance that correctly.

3:16:56.940 --> 3:17:01.340
 And meanwhile time just marches on.

3:17:01.340 --> 3:17:02.340
 Just goes.

3:17:02.340 --> 3:17:11.740
 And all of this will be forgotten, both you and I, but forgotten in time.

3:17:11.740 --> 3:17:15.780
 That's what I say to them every time I'm putting them to bed.

3:17:15.780 --> 3:17:18.700
 We will be lost in the sands of time.

3:17:18.700 --> 3:17:20.580
 You know that, I bet you know this poem.

3:17:20.580 --> 3:17:22.620
 You know that poem, Ozzy Mandious?

3:17:22.620 --> 3:17:24.020
 Yes.

3:17:24.020 --> 3:17:26.180
 Can I read you a poem?

3:17:26.180 --> 3:17:27.180
 Okay.

3:17:27.180 --> 3:17:32.260
 Let's, let's end our conversation in a poem.

3:17:32.260 --> 3:17:33.340
 I love it.

3:17:33.340 --> 3:17:40.380
 It's by Pierce Bych Shelley, probably mispronouncing the name, but I think you'll get it.

3:17:40.380 --> 3:17:41.380
 There's no right way to pronounce anything.

3:17:41.380 --> 3:17:42.380
 Thank you.

3:17:42.380 --> 3:17:43.380
 Thank you.

3:17:43.380 --> 3:17:45.740
 I'm Ozzy Mandious.

3:17:45.740 --> 3:17:52.140
 I met a traveler from an antique land who said, two vast and trunkless legs of stone

3:17:52.140 --> 3:18:00.340
 stand in the desert, near them on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown

3:18:00.340 --> 3:18:06.980
 and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command tell that it sculptor well those passions

3:18:06.980 --> 3:18:13.540
 red, which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things, the hand that mocked them and the

3:18:13.540 --> 3:18:20.580
 heart that fed and on the pedestal, these words appear, my name is Ozzy Mandious, King

3:18:20.580 --> 3:18:27.740
 of Kings, look on my works ye mighty and despair, nothing besides remains around the decay of

3:18:27.740 --> 3:18:38.220
 that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, the lone and level sand stretch far away.

3:18:38.220 --> 3:18:47.620
 All gone, behold the king, look on my works ye mighty and despair, and despair, even

3:18:47.620 --> 3:18:53.500
 though we'll be forgotten in the sands of time, Duncan, I'm just so glad that you exist

3:18:53.500 --> 3:18:57.500
 and you put so much love into the world over the past many years that I've gotten just

3:18:57.500 --> 3:19:03.340
 to enjoy it by being your fan, and thank you so much for continuing that and for sharing

3:19:03.340 --> 3:19:04.780
 a bit of love with me today.

3:19:04.780 --> 3:19:05.780
 Can we be friends?

3:19:05.780 --> 3:19:06.780
 Let's be friends.

3:19:06.780 --> 3:19:09.580
 In real time, in the real world, in 3D space?

3:19:09.580 --> 3:19:13.580
 Nothing is real, but yes, in this particular slice of the multidimensional world we'll

3:19:13.580 --> 3:19:14.580
 live in.

3:19:14.580 --> 3:19:16.300
 It will be an honor and a pleasure.

3:19:16.300 --> 3:19:17.300
 Thank you for having me on your show.

3:19:17.300 --> 3:19:18.300
 Yeah.

3:19:18.300 --> 3:19:19.300
 Love you, Duncan.

3:19:19.300 --> 3:19:20.300
 I love you.

3:19:20.300 --> 3:19:21.300
 Thank you, Lex.

3:19:21.300 --> 3:19:23.380
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Duncan Trussell.

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Duncan Trussell himself.

3:19:32.300 --> 3:19:40.300
 You are essentially just the cloud of atoms that will eventually be aerosolized by time.

3:19:40.300 --> 3:19:50.300
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
