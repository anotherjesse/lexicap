 The following is a conversation with Rick Doblin, founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary

00:06.040 --> 00:09.840
 Association for Psychedelic Studies, MAPS.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.120
 He is one of the seminal figures in both the cultural history and the cutting edge science

00:14.120 --> 00:15.120
 of psychedelics.

00:15.120 --> 00:20.940
 He was there, along with the biggest characters, throughout this fascinating history of psychedelics,

00:20.940 --> 00:23.840
 and he is here to tell the story.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.800
 Quick mention of our sponsors, TheraGun, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and A.Sleep.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.600
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:32.600 --> 00:38.120
 As a side note, let me say that exploring the places the human mind can go can help

00:38.120 --> 00:43.760
 us understand where it comes from, how it works, and how to engineer mental journeys,

00:43.760 --> 00:49.320
 whether that's through life experiences, chemical substances, brain computer interfaces,

00:49.320 --> 00:52.200
 or interactions with artificial intelligence systems.

00:52.200 --> 00:57.760
 On a personal level, I think the dissolution of the ego for stretches of time is a powerful

00:57.760 --> 01:00.000
 tool for understanding yourself.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.480
 A lot of things can do this, including jiu jitsu, literature, meditation, but psychedelics

01:05.480 --> 01:11.680
 is definitely, or at least arguably, one of the most powerful, from psilocybin to DMT.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.640
 I'm excited that people like Rick are leading the scientific research that reveals the efficacy

01:16.640 --> 01:22.440
 and the safety of these substances, so that their proper dosage and usage protocols can

01:22.440 --> 01:29.880
 be understood, and people like me can safely and effectively use them, not just for recreation,

01:29.880 --> 01:33.720
 but for rigorous exploration of my own mind.

01:33.720 --> 01:40.040
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Rick Doblin.

01:40.040 --> 01:47.360
 Could you give an introduction to psychedelics, like a big, bold, whirlwind overview?

01:47.360 --> 01:49.040
 What are psychedelics?

01:49.040 --> 01:54.880
 What are the kinds of psychedelics out there in whatever way you think is meaningful?

01:54.880 --> 01:56.880
 All right.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.920
 When I started MAAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, it was

02:00.920 --> 02:06.040
 very important for me that psychedelic be in the name, and the way in which the original

02:06.040 --> 02:11.280
 meaning of psychedelic is mind manifesting.

02:11.280 --> 02:18.760
 It was created by Humphrey Osmond in dialogue with Alotus Huxley.

02:18.760 --> 02:26.800
 Psychedelic means mind manifesting, and so we interpret that very broadly to mean dreams

02:26.800 --> 02:27.880
 or psychedelic.

02:27.880 --> 02:32.840
 Anything that brings things to the surface, the holotropic breathwork, hyperventilation

02:32.840 --> 02:34.520
 is psychedelic.

02:34.520 --> 02:39.360
 Most people think psychedelic is only about certain chemical substances, either natural

02:39.360 --> 02:43.440
 or synthetic, but we've got a much broader view of that.

02:43.440 --> 02:48.280
 Meditation can be psychedelic in some ways, but our primary focus is on the drugs, is

02:48.280 --> 02:57.200
 on the medicines, or some people might call them spiritual tools or sacraments.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.840
 There's two general categories of those.

03:00.840 --> 03:06.640
 One are what are called the classic psychedelics, and those are the ego dissolving, sort of

03:06.640 --> 03:10.280
 merged into unitive states.

03:10.280 --> 03:18.240
 Those are like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, ayahuasca, ibogaine, DMT, things like that.

03:18.240 --> 03:23.400
 And then there's MDMA, which some people even argue is not a psychedelic, they'll say it's

03:23.400 --> 03:28.040
 an empathogen or an intactogen, it's about touching within or empathy.

03:28.040 --> 03:35.800
 It doesn't do the same kind of ego dissolution that the classic psychedelics do, but it brings

03:35.800 --> 03:44.280
 material to the surface, and it changes the way we process information.

03:44.280 --> 03:50.520
 And so I think you can quibble about whether it's certainly not a classic psychedelic,

03:50.520 --> 03:52.720
 but I think MDMA is also a psychedelic.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.200
 Marijuana, I would say, is a psychedelic.

03:56.200 --> 04:00.560
 Marijuana is closer to the classic psychedelics than it is to MDMA.

04:00.560 --> 04:05.840
 One point I like to make is dreams, because then everybody can relate to that.

04:05.840 --> 04:06.840
 Dreams are psychedelic.

04:06.840 --> 04:14.880
 They bring emotions, feelings, ideas, concepts, in symbolic form a lot of times, or just in

04:14.880 --> 04:16.480
 raw emotions to the surface.

04:16.480 --> 04:22.160
 So when people hear the word psychedelic, often they are frightened by it.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.400
 It's about loss of control.

04:25.400 --> 04:32.040
 And it is, to an extent, loss of conscious control, particularly with the classic psychedelics.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.640
 And we know with dreams that we can have frightening dreams, nightmares.

04:35.640 --> 04:42.200
 But I think that anchoring the concept of psychedelic in dreams is really helpful for

04:42.200 --> 04:47.000
 people to know that it's kind of a natural state, and that there are other ways that

04:47.000 --> 04:52.560
 you can catalyze it than by going to sleep, and that for thousands of years, substances

04:52.560 --> 04:53.840
 have been used in that way.

04:53.840 --> 04:58.640
 So you mentioned this idea of bringing something to the surface, which is really interesting.

04:58.640 --> 05:05.280
 So can you maybe elaborate the surface and what is there in the depths of things, and

05:05.280 --> 05:09.560
 how does ego dissolution fit into that?

05:09.560 --> 05:16.320
 Well, Aldous Huxley talked about the brain as a reducing valve, that we have an enormous

05:16.320 --> 05:18.200
 amount of information.

05:18.200 --> 05:23.360
 So right now there's an air conditioning sound in the background, but that's not crucial

05:23.360 --> 05:27.680
 to what you and I are doing, talking to each other, so we kind of tune that out.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.920
 There's all sorts of sights and sounds.

05:29.920 --> 05:40.240
 There's incoming information in all the different sense modalities, and we have to figure out

05:40.240 --> 05:42.120
 what's important to us.

05:42.120 --> 05:52.040
 And so the mind, in a way, focuses a lot on what are our core needs, and we filter all

05:52.040 --> 05:56.080
 the incoming information that we get towards focusing on what our core needs, and we can

05:56.080 --> 06:02.560
 even get to Abraham Maslow and the hierarchy of needs about survival needs, belonging needs,

06:02.560 --> 06:04.840
 esteem needs, gone.

06:04.840 --> 06:16.760
 So I think what I mean by bringing things to the surface is that we tend to not focus

06:16.760 --> 06:24.760
 on a lot of things that are coming, but we also push away things that are difficult emotionally,

06:24.760 --> 06:26.800
 difficult cognitively.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.600
 We all know that we're on this very short trajectory from birth to death, but we're

06:30.600 --> 06:38.560
 not constantly thinking about dying, although that can actually be helpful to focus us on

06:38.560 --> 06:41.440
 what's really important.

06:41.440 --> 06:47.680
 Traumas are often suppressed, conflicts.

06:47.680 --> 06:54.800
 We see in America and around the world a kind of rise of irrationality, where people push

06:54.800 --> 07:00.800
 away their logic in order for their emotional tribal needs to be met.

07:00.800 --> 07:06.360
 A lot of people are suffering from early childhood traumas of a different kind, or abandonment

07:06.360 --> 07:08.160
 issues or anything.

07:08.160 --> 07:14.120
 So we tend to focus on just what we need to survive and what we need for work and esteem.

07:14.120 --> 07:22.160
 And so psychedelics, by dissolving this ego control or by, with MDMA, kind of strengthening

07:22.160 --> 07:28.960
 our sense of self and our sense of self acceptance, we can bring in other information that have

07:28.960 --> 07:32.520
 previously been too complicated or too painful.

07:32.520 --> 07:36.600
 You don't think of psychedelics as conjuring up something new.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.640
 It is more revealing something that is already there.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.680
 I think that's a very crucial thing.

07:41.680 --> 07:52.600
 So yes, Sasha Shilgen, who is sort of the godfather of MDMA, he sort of rediscovered

07:52.600 --> 07:57.640
 it and brought it back into use.

07:57.640 --> 08:02.440
 He talked about his first experience was with mescaline, his first psychedelic experience

08:02.440 --> 08:06.120
 was with mescaline, and he had a tremendous experience.

08:06.120 --> 08:12.400
 But what he said about it was he was having a human experience that the mescaline was

08:12.400 --> 08:17.880
 helping him access rather than he was having a mescaline experience.

08:17.880 --> 08:21.680
 So that it's not like you pop a pill and you always have the same kind of experiences

08:21.680 --> 08:24.840
 everybody else, that the experience is not contained in the pill.

08:24.840 --> 08:29.840
 The pill opens you up and you have an experience of yourself.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.800
 Sometimes these are experiences that we've never consciously had.

08:32.800 --> 08:39.240
 But we can say right now that we know that our body below the level of our conscious

08:39.240 --> 08:47.680
 awareness has all these self healing mechanisms, and we don't modulate them to a large extent

08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
 by conscious control.

08:48.680 --> 08:52.560
 I mean, eventually we are learning more about the mind body and we learn about the placebo

08:52.560 --> 08:58.040
 effect, how what we think is the case, but I think that there's experiences that are

08:58.040 --> 09:03.160
 below our level of conscious awareness, particularly once we're adults, that are more of these

09:03.160 --> 09:07.680
 unit of mystical experiences, sense of connection, you know, I think kids are like this a lot.

09:07.680 --> 09:13.120
 We kind of come from the void, you could say, and you're born and you have a different

09:13.120 --> 09:15.000
 way of processing information.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.640
 One interesting point about that has to do with ketamine, which has been approved as

09:20.640 --> 09:22.680
 ketamine for depression.

09:22.680 --> 09:30.520
 But it's used for anesthesia and roughly one tenth the anesthetic dose is a psychedelic

09:30.520 --> 09:32.040
 dose.

09:32.040 --> 09:36.560
 And when it's used in anesthesia, there's what's called the emergent phenomena.

09:36.560 --> 09:42.400
 So this is you get enough ketamine for you can be operated on, you're not in pain, you're

09:42.400 --> 09:46.680
 not really there, your ego's knocked out, but you can still breathe.

09:46.680 --> 09:52.680
 But as the operations get over and then people metabolize the ketamine, there's a process

09:52.680 --> 09:54.360
 that they call the emergent phenomena.

09:54.360 --> 10:00.120
 It's like as you're emerging from this tranquilized state, and that's where you pass through the

10:00.120 --> 10:03.800
 psychedelic phase and they don't prepare people for that.

10:03.800 --> 10:09.320
 And what we see is that a lot of adults have difficult times with that.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.400
 But children don't seem to have those problems.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.000
 Children are a little bit more already in this kind of state.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.280
 And so ketamine is used quite frequently in children now for anesthesia.

10:22.280 --> 10:27.720
 So all of that is to say to your question that I think the psychedelics reveal things

10:27.720 --> 10:30.280
 that are within us.

10:30.280 --> 10:35.120
 Some things that are how we process information back when we were children.

10:35.120 --> 10:41.560
 Other things that we've never thought of before that are sort of baked into our consciousness.

10:41.560 --> 10:50.560
 You know, there's one drug five MEO DMT, it's this toxin from a sonoran toad that many

10:50.560 --> 10:54.160
 people consider it to be the most powerful of all the psychedelics.

10:54.160 --> 10:57.840
 And it kind of knocks the ego structures completely out of it.

10:57.840 --> 11:03.160
 And we experience something different, but it's something I think that's always within

11:03.160 --> 11:04.160
 us.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.160
 It's a deeper layer.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.400
 So we knock out some of the higher cognitive functions and then we experience things in

11:08.400 --> 11:09.400
 a different way.

11:09.400 --> 11:14.840
 So my sense is that these are human experiences that the psychedelics bring us to.

11:14.840 --> 11:19.040
 Yeah, it's really profound, but and that's a DMT is a really interesting example.

11:19.040 --> 11:24.120
 So Terence Piquena has talked about these machine elves, right?

11:24.120 --> 11:30.400
 And there's this, I think from the people I've heard speak about the experience, there's

11:30.400 --> 11:38.200
 a sense that you are traveling elsewhere to meet entities, whether they're elves or not.

11:38.200 --> 11:42.760
 So in your sense, you're not traveling elsewhere.

11:42.760 --> 11:48.520
 You're just revealing something that's within and maybe it's a particular mechanism of revealing

11:48.520 --> 11:50.000
 what's already within.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
 Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
 And I knew Terence.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.560
 I spent a lot of time talking with Terence and I do not ascribe to a lot of things that

11:57.560 --> 11:58.560
 he was saying.

11:58.560 --> 12:03.320
 He was tremendous entertainer and I think he did a lot of really good things and focused

12:03.320 --> 12:10.160
 us on the power of psychedelics, but I think I've never seen these quote machine elves.

12:10.160 --> 12:17.320
 I think culture is more determinative of what people experience under psychedelics, your

12:17.320 --> 12:22.240
 preconceptions than we give it credit for.

12:22.240 --> 12:29.320
 And so I think there's a lot of priming that you could say that people receive by stories

12:29.320 --> 12:38.040
 from their culture with ayahuasca, it's about jaguars and Amazonian animals.

12:38.040 --> 12:47.120
 So I think these machine elves are this construct of Terence that other people do see.

12:47.120 --> 12:53.680
 There's actually some people that are very interested in doing a study and they're well

12:53.680 --> 13:01.920
 funded and moving toward it to keep people on an IV infusion of DMT for them specifically

13:01.920 --> 13:07.120
 to see do they contact machine elves or aliens and what kind of information do they bring

13:07.120 --> 13:14.440
 back from these other selves, other places or other entities.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.840
 One question is who are we?

13:16.840 --> 13:20.560
 Are we connected to everything in the universe?

13:20.560 --> 13:27.200
 We certainly know in many cases you talk about waves or particles, the quantum approach.

13:27.200 --> 13:36.680
 So I don't interpret experiences that we have of some entity that's somehow or other deep

13:36.680 --> 13:39.600
 in our consciousness that's not us.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.720
 It's a part of who we are.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.800
 So I tend to interpret it in that way.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.600
 The question is how big are we?

13:46.600 --> 13:47.600
 Yeah.

13:47.600 --> 13:56.200
 I mean, that's how many ideas are within us that can be revealed by changing the perspective.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.280
 You mentioned physics.

13:59.280 --> 14:07.240
 What physicists, especially mathematical physicists or mathematicians do is they reveal truths

14:07.240 --> 14:15.680
 by taking a slightly different perspective on a problem that reveals the simplicity of

14:15.680 --> 14:17.360
 how it actually works.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.920
 In totally new ways.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.320
 That's what Einstein did.

14:21.320 --> 14:26.880
 Every progress in physics and certainly every progress in mathematics requires you to take

14:26.880 --> 14:32.640
 a different perspective and then perhaps that's exactly what psychedelics are doing.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.960
 It's not that they're contacting aliens that are elsewhere.

14:36.960 --> 14:42.080
 It may be revealing the connection between us and other living life forms or actually

14:42.080 --> 14:49.480
 might be revealing a totally new perspective on what life is or what consciousness is and

14:49.480 --> 14:54.400
 giving us a glimpse at that even though our cognitive capabilities are limited into fully

14:54.400 --> 14:55.920
 grasped and understand it.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.240
 So it's just giving us an inkling of that somehow.

14:58.240 --> 15:03.960
 And it seems perhaps a little ridiculous, not from a scientific perspective in the sense

15:03.960 --> 15:09.960
 that we don't have a good physics of life or physics of intelligence or physics of consciousness,

15:09.960 --> 15:16.840
 but getting a glimpse of that is giving us a little bit of maybe an intuition of which

15:16.840 --> 15:21.320
 way to head to build such a physics.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.320
 Yeah.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.320
 Yeah.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.320
 I think so.

15:24.320 --> 15:31.040
 I think that there's this other concept I guess I would like to talk about briefly, this

15:31.040 --> 15:37.040
 Jungian collective unconscious, this idea that somehow or other everything that has

15:37.040 --> 15:46.760
 ever happened is still accessible, maybe not with as much data or as much resolution, but

15:46.760 --> 15:55.800
 that there's wave resonances so that I do believe that we can have experiences as part

15:55.800 --> 16:01.880
 of this human collective unconscious that we're not from our own life.

16:01.880 --> 16:10.760
 And that we can, like the holographic realities, that there is a way to gather information

16:10.760 --> 16:18.280
 that can be accurate about other times and places through depth investigations of our

16:18.280 --> 16:20.200
 own consciousness.

16:20.200 --> 16:26.040
 But I think what I tend to believe is that it's because there's emotional resonances

16:26.040 --> 16:35.940
 between where we're at now in this life and other kind of experiences that people have

16:35.940 --> 16:37.440
 had before.

16:37.440 --> 16:42.500
 And we always hear about everybody who talks about past life, they're always kings and

16:42.500 --> 16:44.840
 queens.

16:44.840 --> 16:49.160
 So I think that's again, you filter things, what you want to be true.

16:49.160 --> 16:55.760
 But I do think that there is a way to access information beyond what we've taken in in

16:55.760 --> 16:59.800
 our own temporal existence through our own five senses.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.000
 In some ways, I really find that compelling the notion that that information is already

17:03.000 --> 17:09.840
 there and you're simply just moving the attention of your mind to different parts of that.

17:09.840 --> 17:10.840
 Yeah.

17:10.840 --> 17:12.240
 I mean, we have that with the radio.

17:12.240 --> 17:17.800
 I mean, you know, you've got a frequency, you turn all this information, you could actually

17:17.800 --> 17:21.920
 say right now, in the space between us, we have the whole world's knowledge that's up

17:21.920 --> 17:22.920
 on the internet.

17:22.920 --> 17:23.920
 Yeah.

17:23.920 --> 17:24.920
 It's right here.

17:24.920 --> 17:25.920
 We don't see it.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.920
 We just have to tune in.

17:28.920 --> 17:34.520
 What are the interesting differences, would you say, between the various psychedelics

17:34.520 --> 17:35.520
 that you mentioned?

17:35.520 --> 17:42.800
 Ayahuasca DMT, Acid LSD, marijuana, mescaline, PCP, psilocybin, MDMA.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.920
 You mentioned a few of them that are really interesting.

17:44.920 --> 17:49.560
 We'll talk about scientifically some of the different studies that have been conducted

17:49.560 --> 17:52.640
 on each, but sort of at a high level.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.320
 What are some interesting differences?

17:54.320 --> 17:59.880
 Well, one of the big ones that people make a big deal of that I think is completely misplaced

17:59.880 --> 18:03.200
 is summer from nature, summer from the lab.

18:03.200 --> 18:07.000
 So there's this kind of like romantic thought that if it's from nature, it's good.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.920
 If it's from the lab, it's somehow tainted by humanity.

18:10.920 --> 18:15.720
 And you know, therefore, some people are like all four plants psychedelics.

18:15.720 --> 18:22.960
 We see the policy changes that have been happening in a couple cities, Cambridge, Somerville,

18:22.960 --> 18:27.400
 quite not far from where we're at now where they decriminalize plant medicines.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.760
 So they call it decriminalizing nature.

18:30.760 --> 18:40.400
 So I think that there is, from my perspective, certain things from nature are poison, certain

18:40.400 --> 18:47.800
 things from the lab are spiritual, even if they don't show up in nature like LSD.

18:47.800 --> 18:51.600
 Now there is something LSD is lysergic acid diethylamide.

18:51.600 --> 18:56.360
 There is lysergic acid amide, LSA, which comes from morning glory seeds.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.480
 So it's very similar.

18:59.480 --> 19:04.880
 But at the same time, I'd say I don't buy into that distinction that there's some fundamental

19:04.880 --> 19:05.880
 preference.

19:05.880 --> 19:10.400
 One of the things that Terence McKenna, since we talked about him, he talked about how if

19:10.400 --> 19:12.680
 it's from nature, it's good.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.280
 And if it's not, you know, we should be suspect.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.680
 Of course, he had a lot of great LSD experiences.

19:18.680 --> 19:24.920
 But actually, Terence, in 1984, we were at Esselin with a bunch of other people.

19:24.920 --> 19:29.080
 This was before the crackdown on MDMA.

19:29.080 --> 19:33.000
 And this was some of the underground therapists and the above ground researchers who were

19:33.000 --> 19:37.800
 trying to talk about how to protect MDMA from this eventual crackdown.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.080
 And Terence was like, forget about it.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.760
 You know, it's from the lab.

19:41.760 --> 19:42.760
 You know, it's dangerous.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.280
 We have thousands of years of history, all these other things.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.840
 And you know, what do we know about MDMA and blah, blah, blah.

19:48.840 --> 19:57.400
 And I was like, Terence, you're so unscientific, full of shit, another way to say it is.

19:57.400 --> 20:02.080
 And I just said, you know, we need a study of the safety of MDMA.

20:02.080 --> 20:07.360
 And so then Dick Price, who started Esselin, I said, I'll put a thousand, Dick Price, he'd

20:07.360 --> 20:08.360
 put a thousand.

20:08.360 --> 20:13.240
 So Terence was actually the catalyst for the first study with MDMA.

20:13.240 --> 20:16.920
 Just because he was so frustrating about how plants are okay and, you know, if it's from

20:16.920 --> 20:18.800
 the lab, it's bad.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.640
 So that's one distinction.

20:20.640 --> 20:27.720
 The other distinction is this sense of classic psychedelics versus things like MDMA.

20:27.720 --> 20:31.080
 So to what extent do they dissolve the ego?

20:31.080 --> 20:36.680
 And you could say to what extent do they cause visions of the 5HT2A serotonin receptor

20:36.680 --> 20:45.560
 subtype, which is responsible for a lot of that, where these drugs are activating.

20:45.560 --> 20:51.200
 Now masculine of all the psychedelics, chemically, it's the most similar to MDMA.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.080
 It's a phenethylamine, which is MDMA.

20:54.080 --> 21:00.440
 So in the 50s, there was the 53, I think it was, the Army Chemical Warfare Service wanted

21:00.440 --> 21:05.800
 to look at drugs for interrogations, mind control, nonlethal incapacitance.

21:05.800 --> 21:11.040
 They did a study in eight substances.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.800
 These were now toxicity studies in animals.

21:13.800 --> 21:17.560
 And on the one side was methamphetamine, on the other was mescaline, and MDMA was in

21:17.560 --> 21:20.040
 the middle chemically.

21:20.040 --> 21:27.560
 So mescaline of these psychedelics tends to have a warmth that MDMA has.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.520
 It's not as ego dissolving quite as some of the others.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.000
 I mean, it's the main active ingredient in paodi.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.040
 It is very psychedelic, very visual.

21:37.040 --> 21:41.400
 Another distinction with these different drugs is how long they last.

21:41.400 --> 21:45.160
 And a lot of that has to do with the route of administration.

21:45.160 --> 21:53.080
 So for example, if you smoke DMT, it takes 10, 15 minutes and you're within seconds,

21:53.080 --> 21:55.080
 you're off in another world.

21:55.080 --> 21:59.720
 Similarly 5MEO DMT, very rapid.

21:59.720 --> 22:06.560
 When you take DMT in the form of ayahuasca, where it's mixed with another substance that

22:06.560 --> 22:11.440
 makes it so that it's orally active, then it's a couple hours.

22:11.440 --> 22:16.760
 So LSD is 8, 10, 12 hours sometimes.

22:16.760 --> 22:20.920
 So lacybin is more like five or six hours or four to six hours.

22:20.920 --> 22:23.880
 MDMA is similar.

22:23.880 --> 22:28.600
 It's one reason why in our research, we give an initial dose of MDMA and then two hours

22:28.600 --> 22:33.680
 later, we give half the initial amount to extend the plateau because we want it to last

22:33.680 --> 22:38.360
 longer for people to be in this therapeutic state.

22:38.360 --> 22:42.600
 So that's another distinction is how long these drugs last.

22:42.600 --> 22:47.920
 Another distinction is which of them come from a religious context, have a religion

22:47.920 --> 22:49.400
 built around them.

22:49.400 --> 22:54.960
 We have this sense that some people are saying that 5MEO DMT and the Sonoran Toad that they

22:54.960 --> 22:58.720
 have this long history of indigenous use, but they don't.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.720
 That's all modern.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.160
 It's made up and it's kind of a new approach.

23:02.160 --> 23:09.600
 However, there was thousands of years of use of psilocybin mushrooms in religious contexts.

23:09.600 --> 23:20.040
 From 1600 BC to 396 AD, the world's longest mystery ceremonies, the Ellucinian Mysteries,

23:20.040 --> 23:23.600
 sort of the heart of Greek culture, the heart of Western culture, that was a psychedelic

23:23.600 --> 23:30.760
 potion called Kikian that seems like it's very much like an LSD like substance, air

23:30.760 --> 23:37.040
 got on grain, and LSD comes from air got.

23:37.040 --> 23:41.360
 So I think that there are a lot of ways to look at these different substances.

23:41.360 --> 23:47.720
 Another distinction is which one of them are being researched right now in scientific

23:47.720 --> 23:50.240
 contexts and which are not.

23:50.240 --> 23:54.080
 And because of the rise of all these for profit companies and everybody's looking for what

23:54.080 --> 24:01.080
 they can patent, what they can claim, the land grab, more and more there are companies

24:01.080 --> 24:04.480
 looking at every different kind of psychedelics.

24:04.480 --> 24:09.480
 The ones that are most important that are not being researched, Mescaline, but now there's

24:09.480 --> 24:17.360
 a company to do Mescaline, Journey Co Lab, Ibogaine, which is crucial for opiate addiction.

24:17.360 --> 24:23.800
 There's a new company, a branch of this company, a tie that's going to be looking at Ibogaine.

24:23.800 --> 24:30.000
 So I'd say the rise of the for profit companies is making it so that there's just going to

24:30.000 --> 24:36.480
 be an enormous amount of investigations into all these different psychedelics.

24:36.480 --> 24:41.400
 But what we're going to see is the development of new psychedelics that we don't know anything

24:41.400 --> 24:45.640
 about that have not existed yet, because a lot of these for profit companies are going

24:45.640 --> 24:51.920
 to want to invent and patent and have composition of matter patents on new molecules.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.840
 So I think we'll see a lot of that happening too.

24:53.840 --> 24:54.840
 That's really fast.

24:54.840 --> 24:59.040
 I mean, there's a lot of doors you've opened and we're going to walk through all of them,

24:59.040 --> 25:00.560
 including the research and so on.

25:00.560 --> 25:08.760
 But on this one little tangent of the future of psychedelics, so engineering new psychedelics,

25:08.760 --> 25:14.520
 can you comment on maybe the chemistry and the biology of how psychedelics work and where

25:14.520 --> 25:21.760
 is the space of possible engineering of psychedelics and what kind of things might they unlock

25:21.760 --> 25:31.360
 in terms of the possible places our mind would be able to go and the effects of that of improving

25:31.360 --> 25:38.320
 health, but maybe at the basic level of chemistry and the space of what could be engineered?

25:38.320 --> 25:42.560
 Well, I'll get to exactly what you said.

25:42.560 --> 25:49.320
 But you reminded me of a talk I heard by Buckminster Fuller shortly before he died.

25:49.320 --> 25:58.080
 And what he talked about is how technology was making things ever smaller, that we are

25:58.080 --> 26:02.960
 able to pack more and more information into smaller and smaller spaces and that we're

26:02.960 --> 26:08.400
 developing technologies of communications with people we now know the internet and things

26:08.400 --> 26:09.400
 like that.

26:09.400 --> 26:16.640
 And he said this, that he thought the eventual evolution of this sort of research would move

26:16.640 --> 26:20.360
 from this miniaturization to telepathy.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.360
 Yeah.

26:21.360 --> 26:27.920
 And I was like a shocking thing for somebody like scientific like that to say that.

26:27.920 --> 26:34.160
 So will we unlock those parts where I talked about the collective unconscious?

26:34.160 --> 26:39.380
 Will we be able to more consciously explore those areas?

26:39.380 --> 26:42.200
 So I think that that's a possibility.

26:42.200 --> 26:50.120
 There was Stan Groff, who's the world's leading LSD researcher and has been my mentor, his

26:50.120 --> 26:51.840
 wife Brigida.

26:51.840 --> 26:59.480
 They were talking about stories that they had heard about MDMA that people take.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.880
 And then on top of that, they do 5MEO DMT.

27:02.880 --> 27:10.840
 And so you get this ego dissolution, but underneath it, you have this sense of ego, sort of sense

27:10.840 --> 27:15.360
 of self, of safety, of self acceptance, kind of grounds it.

27:15.360 --> 27:19.320
 So Stan was like, that's the future of psychiatry.

27:19.320 --> 27:23.920
 That you can watch without the terror of the ego dissolution, the sense that you're losing

27:23.920 --> 27:28.720
 your mind or you're going crazy or you're dying or, you know, that you have this grounded

27:28.720 --> 27:33.920
 sense of safety while you're dissolving your normal sense of how you see things.

27:33.920 --> 27:39.600
 And being able to engineer in a fine tuned way that exact experience, maybe fine tuned

27:39.600 --> 27:47.120
 to the person as opposed to sort of this manual potion that's through experiment.

27:47.120 --> 27:51.040
 Although I don't know about fine tuning things to the person in the sense that we believe

27:51.040 --> 27:55.160
 there's this inner healer, this kind of inner healing intelligence.

27:55.160 --> 27:58.080
 We talked about it, the body repairs itself.

27:58.080 --> 28:06.160
 So I think we more need to create safety for people and then what emerges will be customized

28:06.160 --> 28:09.240
 to what they need to be looking at from this inner healing intelligence.

28:09.240 --> 28:17.520
 At the same time, we will move to, you know, we hear so much about the new approaches to

28:17.520 --> 28:23.320
 oncology where, you know, you do a genetic analysis of different kind of tumors and

28:23.320 --> 28:27.960
 then you have certain kind of chemotherapy agents and you do like personalized chemotherapy.

28:27.960 --> 28:33.160
 I think we will have more like personalized psychedelic therapy, but it'll be more like

28:33.160 --> 28:37.560
 a sequence of different drugs that people go through over an extended period of time.

28:37.560 --> 28:41.840
 And then you kind of customize what's next and sometimes you'll combine different drugs

28:41.840 --> 28:48.840
 together like this five MEO DMT and MDMA or a lot of times people do LSD MDMA combinations

28:48.840 --> 28:53.280
 or psilocybin MDMA combinations.

28:53.280 --> 29:01.520
 Therapy and, you know, it's not my strength, I'm more into clinical applications and policy,

29:01.520 --> 29:06.200
 but I can say that from what I've learned from reading from others and research done

29:06.200 --> 29:12.680
 by others that, you know, different psychedelics have an impact on different neurotransmitters,

29:12.680 --> 29:16.520
 different other parts of energies in the brain.

29:16.520 --> 29:24.440
 The default mode network is what's considered to be like our sense of self, you know, and

29:24.440 --> 29:28.400
 it's this, it's part of the brain that sort of is what I described before, scanning the

29:28.400 --> 29:35.760
 world and filtering information for what's really important to us and both focusing us

29:35.760 --> 29:40.760
 on things and also helping us to ignore a lot of things.

29:40.760 --> 29:46.440
 And the classic psychedelics all weaken the energy in this default mode system and therefore

29:46.440 --> 29:50.240
 you get this flood of information that you're not normally paying attention to.

29:50.240 --> 29:55.760
 And then you start seeing in more creative waves or more connected, you actually move

29:55.760 --> 30:02.720
 to beyond the verbal kind of thinking into sort of symbolic thinking a lot of times.

30:02.720 --> 30:06.760
 And that's where you sometimes get these mystical sense of connection, how it's all one and

30:06.760 --> 30:15.680
 you get the sense also of how big the universe is and how small each one of us is.

30:15.680 --> 30:21.280
 So there's a lot of work that Sasha Shilgen and Albert Hoffman who invented LSD and first

30:21.280 --> 30:25.120
 synthesized psilocybin on what they call structure activity relationships.

30:25.120 --> 30:31.080
 What is the structural molecule and then how do you predict what that new molecule that

30:31.080 --> 30:35.960
 never existed before is going to do once you actually take it.

30:35.960 --> 30:43.200
 And you can get close, but you never really know until you actually take the drug.

30:43.200 --> 30:51.160
 And the way that Sasha ran his experiments is that he would take the drugs himself first

30:51.160 --> 30:56.080
 in low doses and he would sort of step up the doses to have more experiences.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.880
 If he thought it was valuable, he'd share it with his wife Anne.

30:59.880 --> 31:03.680
 But then what they would do is if they both thought it was valuable, they had a group

31:03.680 --> 31:08.460
 of 12 people that they were with for many, many years and they would distribute these

31:08.460 --> 31:13.680
 new drugs to these 12 people and they would get the different perspectives.

31:13.680 --> 31:17.400
 And he thought that 12 was like a minimum number because we're so unique how each of

31:17.400 --> 31:18.920
 us see things.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.080
 But then you kind of get a little bit of a consensus on how a lot of people are going

31:22.080 --> 31:23.080
 to see it.

31:23.080 --> 31:27.320
 And then if that 12 people were positive about it, then they would turn it over to Leo Zeph

31:27.320 --> 31:31.240
 who we called the secret chief, the leader of the underground psychedelic therapy movement

31:31.240 --> 31:34.960
 and then he would start exploring it in therapy.

31:34.960 --> 31:41.240
 So there's still a lot of mysteries as far as structure activity relationships and it's

31:41.240 --> 31:45.440
 not going to be the case that people go into the lab and they tinker with molecules and

31:45.440 --> 31:48.960
 they know exactly what they're going to get.

31:48.960 --> 31:55.240
 And a lot of it has to do with not so much chemistry as morphology, you could say the

31:55.240 --> 31:59.600
 shape of the molecule and how does that interact with receptor sites.

31:59.600 --> 32:03.480
 And so we're getting better at modeling all of that.

32:03.480 --> 32:09.080
 And how does that interaction relate to the morphing of the human experience and deeply

32:09.080 --> 32:13.280
 understanding that perhaps there's no equations yet for that kind of thing.

32:13.280 --> 32:17.360
 You really have to build up intuition by experiencing it.

32:17.360 --> 32:22.920
 And over time, the sort of subjective self report like trying to build an understanding

32:22.920 --> 32:24.720
 of the effects of the different chemistries.

32:24.720 --> 32:25.720
 Yeah.

32:25.720 --> 32:26.720
 Yeah.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.320
 You can have approximate ideas, but to know exactly.

32:29.320 --> 32:37.400
 So when I first tried MDMA, which was 1982, and this was after I had done lots of LSD

32:37.400 --> 32:46.560
 and mescaline and mushrooms, I was shocked at how different it was than these other substances

32:46.560 --> 32:49.360
 and yet how profound it was.

32:49.360 --> 32:54.480
 So are there a whole new kind of categories of classes of drugs that we're not aware of

32:54.480 --> 33:04.360
 that would be not so much this like eco dissolution or emotional, well, what MDMA does is reduces

33:04.360 --> 33:08.320
 activity in the amygdala, the fear processing part of the brain.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.400
 So it's not just chemistry, but it routes energy throughout the brain in a different

33:12.400 --> 33:13.400
 way.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.960
 It increases activity in the prefrontal cortex.

33:15.960 --> 33:20.600
 So you think more logically though, that I think has an enormous impact on the effect

33:20.600 --> 33:22.680
 of MDMA.

33:22.680 --> 33:26.840
 The other thing it does is it increases connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus.

33:26.840 --> 33:32.960
 So it helps facilitate processing of things into long term memory.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.520
 And with PTSD, trauma is like never in the past.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.640
 It's always about to happen.

33:36.640 --> 33:43.800
 So will we one time develop drugs that would even be specific to certain kind of memories?

33:43.800 --> 33:50.320
 We're working with a woman, Rachel Yehuda, who is at the Bronx VA.

33:50.320 --> 33:55.380
 And she's done some studies that are with the epigenetics of trauma.

33:55.380 --> 33:59.040
 So she's worked with Holocaust survivors and their children.

33:59.040 --> 34:05.800
 And she has identified epigenetic mechanisms by which trauma is passed from generation

34:05.800 --> 34:12.000
 to the generations, sort of like set points for anxiety, fear, certain things like that.

34:12.000 --> 34:18.800
 But the question is, can you actually transmit memories from one generation to the next?

34:18.800 --> 34:27.960
 Now this is not DNA changes, which happen over a very long period of time and evolutionary

34:27.960 --> 34:28.960
 scale.

34:28.960 --> 34:34.160
 But within one lifetime, within some experiences, your epigenetics, what turns on the genes

34:34.160 --> 34:37.280
 or turns off certain genes, that can be impacted.

34:37.280 --> 34:42.480
 And that's what we know now can be transmitted from generation to generation, either by the

34:42.480 --> 34:45.920
 father or the mother through the sperm or the egg.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.840
 So it's pretty remarkable.

34:48.840 --> 34:55.120
 So what Rachel's going to try to do is MDMA research for PTSD and look at these epigenetic

34:55.120 --> 35:00.400
 markers before and after and see if they change as a consequence of therapy.

35:00.400 --> 35:07.360
 So will we develop one day certain kind of chemicals that will be able to bring certain

35:07.360 --> 35:10.680
 kind of memories to the surface?

35:10.680 --> 35:12.760
 That's not inconceivable.

35:12.760 --> 35:17.680
 The epigenetic angle is fascinating that there will be these epigenetic perturbations that

35:17.680 --> 35:22.960
 lead to memories living from one generation to the other.

35:22.960 --> 35:30.840
 And then bringing those memories to the surface and using that as signal to understand what

35:30.840 --> 35:34.720
 exactly the psychedelics bring to the surface and not.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.720
 Yeah.

35:35.720 --> 35:38.200
 Now the other portion of that though is culture.

35:38.200 --> 35:42.960
 I mean, culture is where we store all these memories and in the stories that we get passed

35:42.960 --> 35:43.960
 out.

35:43.960 --> 35:49.480
 Especially with a lot of shared, you talked about the Holocaust or World War II, where

35:49.480 --> 35:56.760
 it is deeply ingrained in the culture, the impact of those events and sort of an aggregate,

35:56.760 --> 36:01.680
 the different perspectives on that particular event create a set of stories that you can

36:01.680 --> 36:03.320
 plug into.

36:03.320 --> 36:09.080
 And they kind of resonate with some aspect of you that creates a memory that's connected

36:09.080 --> 36:13.440
 to, like when I think about World War II and the Holocaust, I think about my own family.

36:13.440 --> 36:19.120
 But in some sense, it's also resonating with stories of many others.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.160
 So it's like somehow the two echo each other.

36:22.160 --> 36:25.520
 And I'm just providing my own little flavor on top.

36:25.520 --> 36:29.400
 The meat of the stories are probably those that are shared with others.

36:29.400 --> 36:35.720
 Just plugging into the collective unconscious, that's really fascinating, really plugging

36:35.720 --> 36:47.200
 into precisely plugging into particular memories as a way to deal with trauma and PTSD, that

36:47.200 --> 36:48.200
 kind of thing.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.200
 Yeah.

36:49.200 --> 36:54.160
 I'll just add that the most important dream of my life ever was of a Holocaust survivor

36:54.160 --> 37:03.440
 telling me that he was miraculously saved from death, and he knew that he was saved

37:03.440 --> 37:06.600
 for a particular purpose, but he never knew what that purpose was.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.720
 So in the dream, I'm seeing him on his deathbed.

37:09.720 --> 37:13.760
 And then he shows me whatever happened to him during the Holocaust.

37:13.760 --> 37:19.000
 And then we're back in the room on his deathbed, and he says, well, I know what my purpose

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
 was now.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.480
 And I'm like, oh, great.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.480
 What was it?

37:22.480 --> 37:26.360
 I was just to tell you to be a psychedelic therapist and to study psychedelics and bring

37:26.360 --> 37:28.640
 back psychedelic research.

37:28.640 --> 37:31.960
 And I thought to myself, I've already decided to do this.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.080
 You can lay this on me.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.160
 I can say yes, and then you can die in peace.

37:35.160 --> 37:38.280
 And then he died in front of my eyes in the dream.

37:38.280 --> 37:45.840
 So I think that that kind of cultural transmission that I got from when I was really young then

37:45.840 --> 37:55.080
 manifested in this dream, and that was this story about how people can be incredibly vicious

37:55.080 --> 37:59.000
 and can be very motivated by irrational factors.

37:59.000 --> 38:07.800
 And so I just feel that this kind of multigenerational transmission of this story of the irrational

38:07.800 --> 38:15.560
 being a murderous factor and something I needed to respond to was deeply ingrained.

38:15.560 --> 38:22.240
 And I would say my guess is more culturally than this epigenetic mechanism.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.240
 Yes.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.240
 Yeah.

38:24.240 --> 38:31.680
 But your sense is that whatever stimulated a certain part of human nature in World War

38:31.680 --> 38:38.840
 II, especially in Nazi Germany, but also in Stalinist Soviet Union, still is within

38:38.840 --> 38:40.360
 us, within all of us.

38:40.360 --> 38:47.520
 Just like what we're saying, we embody quite a lot of things.

38:47.520 --> 38:56.360
 And one of those is whatever the capacity for evil seems to be one of those things.

38:56.360 --> 38:57.360
 Yeah.

38:57.360 --> 39:03.480
 There's a quote from Carl Jung from just a few years before he died.

39:03.480 --> 39:10.280
 What he says, and I'll just paraphrase it, is that we need to understand psychology.

39:10.280 --> 39:18.440
 We need to understand who man is, that the greatest danger to us is man.

39:18.440 --> 39:23.920
 There are no other dangers, really, that impact our species.

39:23.920 --> 39:29.160
 And then he goes on to say that we are the source of all coming evil.

39:29.160 --> 39:34.160
 Now, this was 15 years or so after World War II.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.160
 But yeah.

39:35.160 --> 39:39.440
 And I'd say one of the most important psychedelic experiences of my life was a DMT experience.

39:39.440 --> 39:45.080
 So Terrence was there, Ralph Metzner, Andy Weill, a few others.

39:45.080 --> 39:51.040
 And we were sitting around at Estlin smoking DMT.

39:51.040 --> 39:57.720
 And under the influence of DMT, which now this was the first time I've ever smoked DMT,

39:57.720 --> 40:04.280
 I had this super rapid fraction of a second, like dissolving of everything that I, well,

40:04.280 --> 40:08.320
 first off, I saw a horizontal line, then I saw a vertical line, then it turned into

40:08.320 --> 40:11.560
 a color red, then it was red, then it turned into cubes.

40:11.560 --> 40:16.280
 Then it turned into like an MC Escher kind of like, I don't know, you know, didn't make

40:16.280 --> 40:17.280
 logical sense.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.920
 And then I was gone.

40:18.920 --> 40:26.080
 And then it was just this period of 5, 10 minutes of just feeling part of this enormous

40:26.080 --> 40:32.720
 wave of billions of years of evolution and how I had this sense that in my innermost sense

40:32.720 --> 40:38.640
 of who I am uniquely individually, this inner voice that's talking to me, that I didn't

40:38.640 --> 40:43.600
 develop English, that it's like a gift to me from millions of people.

40:43.600 --> 40:49.200
 So that even in my most innermost sense, it's not just me.

40:49.200 --> 40:53.880
 It's the product of everything that came before me, I'm part of this bigger system.

40:53.880 --> 40:57.800
 And then I just thought, wow, just how many billions of years does it take to reach this

40:57.800 --> 41:01.160
 point of self awareness and all this and it was glorious, beautiful.

41:01.160 --> 41:07.040
 And then I had this thought, and this is where this kind of intellectual honesty, I guess

41:07.040 --> 41:10.120
 you could say, I just thought, well, if I'm part of everything and everything's part of

41:10.120 --> 41:15.240
 me, then it's not just the good parts that Hitler's part of me too.

41:15.240 --> 41:20.520
 And that was just this shock, like a stone sunk, you know, and I just was very moody

41:20.520 --> 41:23.040
 for the whole next day.

41:23.040 --> 41:27.920
 But it was that acknowledgement that each of us carries these potentials and what we

41:27.920 --> 41:33.520
 activate is what matters, but what our potential are is the whole full range of things.

41:33.520 --> 41:39.440
 I don't know if you can comment about the DMT trip itself and what it's like starting

41:39.440 --> 41:46.960
 from the very basic geometric shapes and then launching yourself into the context of the

41:46.960 --> 41:52.520
 enormity of space and time and human history.

41:52.520 --> 42:01.160
 Is there anything else to be said about that kind of visually or physically or emotionally

42:01.160 --> 42:07.280
 about that journey, what it's like, that brief journey that reveals so much?

42:07.280 --> 42:10.200
 Well, I was with a group of people.

42:10.200 --> 42:15.920
 The way we were doing it was, you know, each of us would smoke DMT, have 10, 15 minutes

42:15.920 --> 42:20.040
 experience while we closed our eyes and everybody else was just chatting and then the person

42:20.040 --> 42:24.640
 who did the DMT would come back and tell their story of what happened.

42:24.640 --> 42:27.760
 And then we'd think about it for a bit and then pass the pipe to the next person.

42:27.760 --> 42:32.480
 And so this was like a whole evening, you know, and even the sorry to interrupt, even

42:32.480 --> 42:35.960
 the conversations themselves then is part of the experience.

42:35.960 --> 42:36.960
 Exactly.

42:36.960 --> 42:37.960
 Yes.

42:37.960 --> 42:38.960
 Yes.

42:38.960 --> 42:39.960
 Because it's also what you bring back.

42:39.960 --> 42:40.960
 Right.

42:40.960 --> 42:43.600
 I mean, I think that's particularly for therapy, you know, it's not so much about what the

42:43.600 --> 42:48.840
 experience is, but it's what you bring back and what do you integrate.

42:48.840 --> 42:54.840
 And then also, how do you learn how to do these things on your own without the drugs?

42:54.840 --> 42:58.400
 There is this way, because we're saying it's sort of a core human experience.

42:58.400 --> 43:02.000
 The drug is the mediator, but can we do this on our own?

43:02.000 --> 43:07.600
 And once you've seen it and felt it, then you have a little bit better sense to recreate

43:07.600 --> 43:08.600
 it on your own.

43:08.600 --> 43:13.200
 Although, you know, I've had dreams where I've been doing LSD and tripping.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.600
 I was just incredible.

43:14.600 --> 43:19.880
 And it was, I was tripping in my dreams, but I had not taken LSD.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.120
 So there's this way in which we do that.

43:22.120 --> 43:27.720
 So I would say that from the DMT experience, the sense of safety, that's what I was trying

43:27.720 --> 43:32.440
 to get at with this, the group of us and this group of friends trying to do this common exploration

43:32.440 --> 43:40.400
 that if you have this sense of safety, you're incredibly vulnerable because you are giving

43:40.400 --> 43:44.800
 up your awareness really of what's happening around you.

43:44.800 --> 43:55.400
 I think there's, what we're finding is that in our psychedelic research for PTSD and what

43:55.400 --> 44:01.400
 we see with the vaccines, that even African Americans are reluctant to volunteer for vaccines

44:01.400 --> 44:07.040
 because they haven't had that sense of safety from the medical establishment.

44:07.040 --> 44:10.600
 They don't volunteer for psychedelic therapy even as much.

44:10.600 --> 44:16.720
 So the overlay has to be this sense of safety as you become vulnerable and looking inside.

44:16.720 --> 44:22.840
 You're not, I was just actually told about how there's a lot of work being done inside

44:22.840 --> 44:25.840
 prisons to teach mindfulness.

44:25.840 --> 44:34.080
 And you know, so one of the, Charlene who's my assistant is trying to do work on helping

44:34.080 --> 44:39.640
 people in prison with trauma, potentially one day with MDMA or meditation or mindfulness.

44:39.640 --> 44:45.160
 But one of the exercises was teaching people to, okay, here's how you deal with stress.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.800
 Just close your eyes and deep breathe.

44:46.800 --> 44:50.960
 And what Charlene was saying is people don't close their eyes in prison.

44:50.960 --> 44:52.400
 You don't feel safe to do that.

44:52.400 --> 44:59.840
 So all that is just to say is that the context is the most important factor.

44:59.840 --> 45:06.960
 So while I'll talk about the DMT experience, the context was this supportive sense of safety

45:06.960 --> 45:13.320
 that I could be completely vulnerable and out of any kind of control women, I think,

45:13.320 --> 45:20.880
 you know, often are less safe in this way than men because of all the sexual assaults.

45:20.880 --> 45:28.680
 But what it can do by taking the ego orientation offline to some extent, it opens you up to

45:28.680 --> 45:33.800
 much more and to make a bigger point of that.

45:33.800 --> 45:38.320
 We could say that it's very similar to the Copernican revolution.

45:38.320 --> 45:42.040
 And you know, people thought that the earth was the center of the universe.

45:42.040 --> 45:47.440
 And you know, the inquisition murdered people that questioned that.

45:47.440 --> 45:48.720
 Father Bruno burned at the stake.

45:48.720 --> 45:54.200
 Actually, one of the things he said, I think that's worth all these years later saying

45:54.200 --> 46:01.920
 is that when the inquisition sensed him to burn at the stake for espousing this idea

46:01.920 --> 46:07.640
 that the earth was not really the center of the universe, he said to the inquisition,

46:07.640 --> 46:15.640
 he said, your fear in sentencing me is greater than my fear in being sentenced, that their

46:15.640 --> 46:22.120
 worldview was so rigid that they had to wipe out anybody that would question it.

46:22.120 --> 46:30.080
 And so this idea of psychedelics displacing our ego is the center of the universe.

46:30.080 --> 46:35.480
 And to realize that we are just rotating around something much bigger than our individual

46:35.480 --> 46:41.560
 life, you know, our ego is designed almost to protect this body while we're alive.

46:41.560 --> 46:45.320
 And you can understand all the good reasons why that is.

46:45.320 --> 46:48.720
 But it also disconnects us from this bigger reality.

46:48.720 --> 46:54.200
 And so the psychedelics, DMT, by knocking this sort of ego orientation or the default

46:54.200 --> 47:00.640
 mode network offline, you open up to the bigger sweeps of history.

47:00.640 --> 47:06.360
 So in that place of safety and vulnerability, in that fascinating group of people, when

47:06.360 --> 47:09.960
 their ego was dissolved in this way, did they have similar experiences?

47:09.960 --> 47:12.640
 Is there different places that their minds went?

47:12.640 --> 47:13.640
 Yeah.

47:13.640 --> 47:19.960
 So once I had this kind of shattering experience that Hitler's part of me, you know, no one

47:19.960 --> 47:21.880
 else in the group had that.

47:21.880 --> 47:26.960
 Probably a lot of them have maybe had that before or they realized that they're not just,

47:26.960 --> 47:32.120
 you know, the good, the white hat, good people and that they're all good and they're, you

47:32.120 --> 47:36.400
 know, got to fight against the bad people, you know, so, you know, people will go in

47:36.400 --> 47:37.400
 different places.

47:37.400 --> 47:40.840
 And not only that, if you do it again, you'll go into a different place than you went to

47:40.840 --> 47:45.040
 the first time, unless you have not resolved the issue.

47:45.040 --> 47:49.720
 So I had a sequence of LSD trips that were very difficult, but it was like coming to

47:49.720 --> 47:57.640
 the same sort of conundrum, the same challenge that I was unable to overcome this idea of

47:57.640 --> 48:03.400
 letting go and really fully dissolving, letting the ego fully go.

48:03.400 --> 48:07.200
 And I would have this sequence of trips over a couple months where I would reach this point

48:07.200 --> 48:11.960
 where I was too scared to move forward and I would just be holding on.

48:11.960 --> 48:15.640
 So there are repeated themes sometimes.

48:15.640 --> 48:20.360
 What Stan Groff has said, which I find very beautiful, is that the full expression of

48:20.360 --> 48:25.360
 an emotion is the funeral pyre of that emotion.

48:25.360 --> 48:31.920
 And what that means is if you can fully let in something, then the essence of life has

48:31.920 --> 48:37.200
 changed is that it moves on, that everything's in motion, and if you can fully experience

48:37.200 --> 48:41.800
 it, even if it's a sense that you're going to be trapped in eternity in this hellish

48:41.800 --> 48:46.040
 state, if you surrender to that, that's the way out.

48:46.040 --> 48:52.400
 You know, this full experience of something is this funeral pyre of that emotion.

48:52.400 --> 48:57.120
 And so that runs against a lot of what modern psychiatry is doing too, which is to suppress

48:57.120 --> 49:04.120
 symptoms and to, instead of supporting people to kind of explore these insecurities so that

49:04.120 --> 49:09.160
 then they can contain them and then they can move on.

49:09.160 --> 49:13.880
 So yeah, resistance is not a way to make progress.

49:13.880 --> 49:16.360
 Right, right.

49:16.360 --> 49:22.400
 Although in one of the reasons why we do the supplemental dose during the MDMA or why there's

49:22.400 --> 49:28.760
 advantages in a 10 hour LSD experience is that you have a lot of opportunities to come

49:28.760 --> 49:33.600
 up against this resistance that may be too difficult to deal with, and then you kind

49:33.600 --> 49:37.120
 of push it aside, and then a couple hours later you come back to it or you come back

49:37.120 --> 49:38.120
 to it.

49:38.120 --> 49:40.680
 Press news every once in a while if you're not ready.

49:40.680 --> 49:41.680
 It's hard to do that.

49:41.680 --> 49:45.520
 I think with MDMA, you can negotiate.

49:45.520 --> 49:50.280
 That's I think a part of its safety in a sense, you can have this like, oh, I should be talking

49:50.280 --> 49:53.800
 about this, but we're not feeling this, but it's too much for me now.

49:53.800 --> 49:54.800
 You can push it away.

49:54.800 --> 49:59.520
 But with the classics psychedelics, this kind of membrane between the conscious and

49:59.520 --> 50:05.280
 the unconscious, that once you take the drug and it weakens this membrane and things are

50:05.280 --> 50:11.360
 coming up, it's very difficult to negotiate with it.

50:11.360 --> 50:18.280
 The key to successful classics psychedelic trips is surrender.

50:18.280 --> 50:23.440
 You've talked about that you first began to reconsider the negative health myths around

50:23.440 --> 50:28.200
 psychedelics when you learned that the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was written

50:28.200 --> 50:32.800
 by Ken Keezy when he was in part under the influence of LSD.

50:32.800 --> 50:40.840
 So how do you think LSD helped him, Ken Keezy, in writing that incredible book?

50:40.840 --> 50:45.160
 There's a process that's called semantic priming.

50:45.160 --> 50:49.800
 And so what that means is that I say night, you say day.

50:49.800 --> 50:56.920
 There's kind of normal patterns of you say one word, what kind of words come to you next.

50:56.920 --> 51:02.320
 And so they've done some research, meaning scientists have done some research where you

51:02.320 --> 51:07.640
 give people a psychedelic and then you do this semantic priming.

51:07.640 --> 51:13.400
 And what you find is they have a wider range of associations than they normally would when

51:13.400 --> 51:15.880
 they're not under psychedelics.

51:15.880 --> 51:25.000
 So I think for Ken Keezy, he was able with psychedelics to get like a deeper kind of

51:25.000 --> 51:31.880
 emotional connection to some of these states of mind that people were in this mental institution

51:31.880 --> 51:38.160
 and that he could explore them more in depth and more eloquently.

51:38.160 --> 51:44.840
 And also one of the things he talked about was the fog machine was how people's minds

51:44.840 --> 51:49.840
 were sort of clouded by the people that ran the institution and the fog machine would

51:49.840 --> 51:50.840
 be coming in.

51:50.840 --> 51:59.280
 So I think the imagery and the metaphors that he used a lot in the book could come to him

51:59.280 --> 52:01.480
 during LSD experiences.

52:01.480 --> 52:10.760
 And then now he wasn't doing very, when you're writing, you have to be literate, you have

52:10.760 --> 52:13.480
 to be able to write.

52:13.480 --> 52:17.800
 So it would be more like beginning and ends of LSD trips instead of at the peak.

52:17.800 --> 52:23.120
 But I think you would get a lot of these, the feeling tones or the images, the metaphors

52:23.120 --> 52:28.840
 I think he would get, these extent, also LSD lasts so long, you can get these extended

52:28.840 --> 52:34.240
 focus and you can really elaborate on images.

52:34.240 --> 52:40.360
 And so much of psychedelic experiences are poetic and metaphorical.

52:40.360 --> 52:49.640
 I mean, you can take veterans who've never read a book of poetry in their lives.

52:49.640 --> 52:54.720
 And under the influence of MDMA, just what they describe, the imagery and the way they

52:54.720 --> 53:00.640
 describe their experiences, metaphorical, poetic, it's incredible.

53:00.640 --> 53:09.600
 And so I think that Ken Keezy was able to channel what LSD did to his mind in a way

53:09.600 --> 53:15.360
 that most people couldn't do, that he did because he was trying to write this novel

53:15.360 --> 53:17.240
 and because he was so brilliant.

53:17.240 --> 53:27.680
 Yeah, I mean, we'll talk about psychedelics and treating in bringing some of trauma to

53:27.680 --> 53:29.800
 the surface and dealing with all those kinds of things.

53:29.800 --> 53:36.600
 But there's something also to the opening up of creativity for whether it's for writing

53:36.600 --> 53:43.800
 purposes or for in my world, for engineering, for invention, innovation and invention itself

53:43.800 --> 53:47.760
 is a deeply creative process.

53:47.760 --> 53:55.200
 And it's fascinating to think with the aid of psychedelics, what kind of ideas can be

53:55.200 --> 53:56.680
 brought to life?

53:56.680 --> 54:00.960
 Yeah, well, we have the whole phenomena of a lot of the people in Silicon Valley and

54:00.960 --> 54:06.040
 else microdosing psychedelics in order to have a little touch more of this creative

54:06.040 --> 54:07.520
 approach to things.

54:07.520 --> 54:12.800
 I would love it to see if it was, that's more like Terence McCann territory, correct me

54:12.800 --> 54:17.240
 if I'm wrong, but I would love to sort of more scientific to where there will be the

54:17.240 --> 54:26.120
 rigor of saying how to do it effectively, how to sort of understand sort of not just

54:26.120 --> 54:36.800
 almost to take the full journey of creative exploration and to do it for prolonged periods

54:36.800 --> 54:44.920
 of time, you know, for years, you know, lifelong kind of part of your life of how it empowers

54:44.920 --> 54:45.920
 creativity.

54:45.920 --> 54:54.760
 I think, of course, you start with helping people deal with trauma.

54:54.760 --> 55:01.160
 And then the next step is people who have moved past their trauma and are trying to

55:01.160 --> 55:04.520
 do something, create something special in their life.

55:04.520 --> 55:07.120
 How can then psychedelics empower that?

55:07.120 --> 55:13.840
 Yeah, now that also just to not shy away from anything controversial, that has that gets

55:13.840 --> 55:19.440
 us to this idea of psychedelics for vision quest, particularly for younger people.

55:19.440 --> 55:23.720
 You know, when you're sort of moving into this adulting kind of phase and you have to

55:23.720 --> 55:27.640
 figure out what are you going to do with your life?

55:27.640 --> 55:28.880
 There's so many options.

55:28.880 --> 55:33.360
 A lot of people, of course, feel constrained that they have very few options.

55:33.360 --> 55:40.680
 But I think this idea of psychedelics as a way to help you find your calling or find

55:40.680 --> 55:45.960
 your vision or find your unique leverage point, I think we'll see that more and more as our

55:45.960 --> 55:49.920
 culture evolves and gets healthier around the use of psychedelics.

55:49.920 --> 55:55.160
 So it's both the science having the rigor of understanding how to do it safely and the

55:55.160 --> 56:03.480
 culture catching up to the fact that this is both safe and like very useful.

56:03.480 --> 56:08.040
 Yeah, although I would question this idea of safety.

56:08.040 --> 56:13.200
 So we can understand physiological risks and we can minimize them.

56:13.200 --> 56:17.840
 And I think there's very minimal physiological risks from the classic psychedelics, virtually

56:17.840 --> 56:24.400
 none were for even MDMA under safe conditions.

56:24.400 --> 56:31.320
 Psychological risks are harder to address, but we can do that through the sense of safety

56:31.320 --> 56:33.120
 and support.

56:33.120 --> 56:39.960
 But I think there's a level of risk there that we shouldn't overlook.

56:39.960 --> 56:45.080
 And so, you know, to make a drug into a medicine, what we have to do is prove to the satisfaction

56:45.080 --> 56:50.520
 of the FDA and other regulatory agencies that things are safe and efficacious.

56:50.520 --> 56:56.920
 But even though they use those words, proving safety and safe and efficacious, it's in relationship

56:56.920 --> 57:01.840
 to the disease that you're trying to treat and you accept a certain amount of risk.

57:01.840 --> 57:06.880
 So it's the risk benefit ratio rather than pure safety.

57:06.880 --> 57:10.440
 Yeah, absolutely.

57:10.440 --> 57:18.840
 Let me ask you about Ken Keezy a little bit longer because he was also part of Project

57:18.840 --> 57:19.840
 MKUltra.

57:19.840 --> 57:20.840
 Yeah.

57:20.840 --> 57:21.840
 Yeah.

57:21.840 --> 57:27.200
 What was Project MKUltra and what lessons we should take away from it?

57:27.200 --> 57:33.720
 Well, MKUltra was a program by the CIA.

57:33.720 --> 57:40.160
 What they were looking at was, can you take these drugs, these psychedelic drugs and weaponize

57:40.160 --> 57:48.480
 them in different ways for interrogation, for true serums, for exposing somebody before

57:48.480 --> 57:52.600
 they give a big talk to something like LSD and then they, you know, can't talk or make

57:52.600 --> 57:58.400
 a fool of themselves or can you spray LSD over the battlefield and have everybody tripping

57:58.400 --> 58:03.480
 and drop their weapons and then you just walk up and, you know, nobody dies and you've won,

58:03.480 --> 58:04.480
 you know, the battle.

58:04.480 --> 58:05.480
 So...

58:05.480 --> 58:06.480
 It's a fascinating concept.

58:06.480 --> 58:11.920
 Yeah, they call it nonlethal incapacitance and I think that's how it's...

58:11.920 --> 58:16.320
 One way to win a war is to enforce peace.

58:16.320 --> 58:19.120
 To get everybody not caring about the war, but yes.

58:19.120 --> 58:22.800
 Well, I think Gandhi said something even better, which is that the true way to win a war is

58:22.800 --> 58:24.640
 to turn your enemy into your friend.

58:24.640 --> 58:27.680
 Yes, that's a beautiful way to put it.

58:27.680 --> 58:32.080
 But MKUltra was really nefarious and it was part of our military and it was done in secret

58:32.080 --> 58:36.040
 and they would dose people against their will.

58:36.040 --> 58:43.760
 I mean, one of the most infamous things was that they had a house of prostitution in San

58:43.760 --> 58:49.160
 Francisco and they would have one way mirrors all the stuff and then they would just dose

58:49.160 --> 58:54.080
 people with LSD, you know, they would have the prostitutes dose these guys with LSD and

58:54.080 --> 58:59.200
 observe what they would do and how they would act and the CIA actually for a while was dosing

58:59.200 --> 59:06.680
 each other secretly and then there's a famous case of this fellow Olsen that either jumped

59:06.680 --> 59:12.760
 out of a window or was pushed, he might have been killed, he was a CIA guy and they gave

59:12.760 --> 59:18.280
 him LSD and then they're trying to see, can they break him down and get him to tell secrets

59:18.280 --> 59:21.840
 and I think he felt uncomfortable with what happened to him while he was under the influence

59:21.840 --> 59:28.480
 of LSD and whether he was pushed or not, I don't know if we'll ever know.

59:28.480 --> 59:41.160
 But MKUltra was violating people's human rights, it was done in secret and the irony

59:41.160 --> 59:48.320
 of it is that Ken Kesey is one of the people, one of the main early people that got LSD

59:48.320 --> 59:53.320
 in this context and then he was one of the main people that helped inspire the hippies

59:53.320 --> 59:57.120
 to use psychedelics to oppose the Vietnam War.

59:57.120 --> 1:00:03.560
 So I think the CIA kind of in many cases, things get out of their control, what they

1:00:03.560 --> 1:00:08.520
 think they can do and it turned into be a disaster for them.

1:00:08.520 --> 1:00:12.400
 I think there was some thought that some of the people at the CIA had is that if you can

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:16.680
 turn people inside, take drugs and they just focus on their internal experience, they're

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:22.120
 not going to be involved politically, it's a way to sort of take people offline and what

1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:25.760
 I don't think they countered on is that when you're offline and you have these unit of

1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:31.120
 spiritual experiences and you realize how we're all connected, then why do you want to go

1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:39.120
 out and kill these Vietnamese and put one dictator over another dictator, dictators on both sides

1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:42.840
 in North Vietnam and South Vietnam, why are we doing that?

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:51.080
 So MKUltra has a very disreputable, we're learning more and more about what they did

1:00:51.080 --> 1:00:55.400
 and one of the unintended consequences was Ken Kesey and not only that, but then the

1:00:55.400 --> 1:01:02.440
 Grateful Dead who began at the acid tests that Kesey was helping to organize and out

1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:09.120
 of that emerged, you could say, just this incredible psychedelic culture and you look

1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:18.360
 at the bands that began in the 60s and which ones have really survived to this day and

1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:22.960
 the Grateful Dead has survived longer than most any other band, I mean some of them have

1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:27.480
 died and all, but it was like the tightness, the sort of telepathy we talked about before

1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:32.880
 that they could just get so tuned in to each other and each other's energies and they could

1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:39.200
 do improvisations and they could do this incredible work that I think the sustainability

1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:46.600
 of the Grateful Dead as a group was a testament to the power of the LSD experiences and that

1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:50.560
 might have never happened if not for MKUltra.

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:59.400
 But can we talk about darkness a little bit, so Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber was allegedly

1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:05.200
 part of the MKUltra studies while at Harvard, do you think this is true?

1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:09.480
 Do you think it had an impact on him psychologically, intellectually, and so on?

1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:12.240
 I do think it's true and I do think it had an impact.

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:19.160
 So we talked before about are these drugs somehow rather producing a certain kind of

1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:23.160
 drug experience or do they bring out what's within?

1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:28.400
 So we have this experience on the one hand Kinkisi and he sort of took positive things

1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:30.080
 out of this.

1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:38.760
 On the other hand, we can get this opposition to the modern world to technology and to the

1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:45.520
 point of creating bombs to try to go after it so that the experience is not in the drug,

1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:50.760
 it's this interaction between the drug, the person, the context.

1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:59.760
 And so we can heal people with psychedelics or people can be driven crazy with psychedelics.

1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:02.080
 It depends again on the context.

1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:05.680
 And so I think it's both these things can be true.

1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:11.240
 And I think it was really good that you kind of highlighted this, that there is this polarities

1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:13.400
 and that it's not in the drug.

1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:19.040
 It's in the other factors and it's who they were beforehand and then how you use that experience.

1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:24.320
 So all that's to say is if we put LSD in the water and everybody were to get it, it doesn't

1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:28.560
 mean that all of a sudden everybody's going to have a mystical experience and then that's

1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:32.960
 all we need to do and humanity is spiritualized or end war and all of this.

1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:41.960
 It's not about the drug and that actually is why for me, we've also talked about engineering

1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:45.720
 new psychedelics and all the people that are going to be trying for profit companies

1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:48.120
 to develop and patent new psychedelics.

1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:55.880
 For me, the most important challenge is new cultural contexts that can create legality,

1:03:55.880 --> 1:04:00.400
 safety, support for the existing psychedelics that we already have.

1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:07.320
 I mean, we have so much incredible tools in these existing psychedelics that it's more

1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:13.640
 about creating context for them to be used in safe medical or personal growth or recreational

1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:15.480
 even with harm reduction, all these different ways.

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:19.920
 That's more important to me than finding some new molecule that's somewhat similar, somewhat

1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:22.640
 different, but it can be patented.

1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:24.560
 So it's the social context.

1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:30.000
 So I do believe that Ted Kaczynski was part of MKALTRA and I think it affected him in

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:37.280
 a negative way and that's a cautionary tale that it's not in the drug, it's in the context.

1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:47.080
 The context of person, still it feels like if viewed from a therapy perspective, perhaps

1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:53.880
 there was a way to use psychedelics to help Ted Kaczynski find a path out of the darkness.

1:04:53.880 --> 1:05:02.640
 I think so and I think that this is where I think MDMA comes in in a way that MDMA is,

1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:08.080
 he felt very isolated and very much out of society in some ways.

1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:13.520
 MDMA stimulates oxytocin, which we haven't mentioned, which is the hormone of nursing

1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:15.760
 mothers of love and connection.

1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:21.680
 It provides a lot of this sense of self acceptance and safety and wanting to be in relationship.

1:05:21.680 --> 1:05:25.000
 There's Gul Dolan is a neuroscientist at Hopkins.

1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:31.520
 She's given octopuses, MDMA, they're solitary creatures except mating season, which is not

1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:35.720
 very often, but you give them MDMA and they become more interested in hanging out with

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:39.640
 other octopuses.

1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:45.360
 For people that have had difficult psychedelic experiences, MDMA helps them integrate them.

1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:50.720
 We've worked with people that had a difficult LSD experience 40 years before and are still

1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:55.720
 able to get back to that under the influence of MDMA and work out some of the conflicts

1:05:55.720 --> 1:06:01.400
 that they weren't able to resolve all those decades before.

1:06:01.400 --> 1:06:07.920
 I think that psychedelics could have been helpful in a different context for Ted Kazinksi,

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:14.240
 but the other big part of it is that people have to be willing to cooperate with the experience.

1:06:14.240 --> 1:06:16.600
 We talked about resistance.

1:06:16.600 --> 1:06:19.080
 People can resist these things.

1:06:19.080 --> 1:06:23.080
 The saying is you can bring a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:27.680
 This is about how people have to be willing to go to these spaces.

1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:33.960
 The essence of our therapeutic approach is that we help people to heal themselves, that

1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:37.160
 we are not giving them the healing.

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:43.160
 It's a flip on the power dynamics that existed, you would say, in the 50s and 60s.

1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:48.800
 My dad was a doctor and the doctors were gods and whatever they said was right.

1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:54.800
 We no longer, of course, believe that, but for a while, psychoanalysis with Freud, that

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:58.320
 they gave the interpretation to the patient, the patient couldn't help themselves, but

1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:03.000
 they would do the free associations and then psychoanalysts would see these conflicts and

1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:07.120
 would be the one that does the healing, would give this interpretation and that would open

1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:08.440
 things up.

1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:13.280
 I think it's this idea of empowering people to heal themselves.

1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:19.360
 If Ted Kazinksi had been in a therapeutic setting with psychedelics and if they'd had

1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:25.920
 something like MDMA available or MDA, which was popular during the 60s, which is a more

1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:31.880
 like MDMA LSD combination, the outcomes might have been different.

1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:35.760
 Let's take a step into the world of studies.

1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:43.520
 Timothy Leary, who was he and what were the most important ideas you've learned from him?

1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:49.560
 I did have the opportunity to get to know him personally and to spend some time with

1:07:49.560 --> 1:07:50.560
 him.

1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:58.760
 Timothy Leary, well, let's start with Nixon saying he's the most dangerous man in America.

1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:02.120
 That's a good place to start.

1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:03.560
 Why did Nixon say that?

1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:11.880
 It's because of this turn on, tune in, drop out.

1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:18.960
 Timothy Leary was just an incredible advocate for think for yourself, question authority.

1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:20.120
 Those were things he said all the time.

1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:21.480
 Think for yourself, question authority.

1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:23.120
 He was a rebel.

1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:25.520
 He was kicked out of West Point.

1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:34.720
 He was a psychologist who was at Harvard for three years from 60 to 63.

1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:42.760
 Before he got to Harvard, he had an experience with mushrooms in Mexico.

1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:46.760
 He said he learned more in that experience than he'd had in his entire academic career

1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:49.760
 before then about how the human mind works.

1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:56.840
 He came to Harvard wanting to do research into psychedelics.

1:08:56.840 --> 1:09:02.520
 He did some very important studies, both of which, well, one was called the Good Friday

1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:08.840
 Experiment, which was whether psychedelics in religiously inclined people taking psilocybin

1:09:08.840 --> 1:09:13.200
 in a religious setting, whether it could produce a mystical experience that took place at Marsh

1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:15.480
 Chapel at the Boston University.

1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:19.960
 Because it's a little bit subjective, or you could say entirely subjective, what people

1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:23.160
 describe happens to them.

1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:26.920
 He wanted to do another study, which would be a more objective measure, and that was

1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:28.800
 called the Concord Prison Experiment.

1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:34.920
 That was the thought, if you can give people psilocybin, mystical sense of connection type

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:39.800
 experiences while they're in prison, when they get out, they'll be more pro social and

1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:43.800
 they'll have reduced recidivism.

1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:44.800
 Tim did that.

1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:49.360
 He also did the naturalistic studies of giving loads of people psilocybin and writing down

1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:52.840
 what their experiences were, the range of experiences.

1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:59.120
 Later on, in his time at Harvard, they started doing LSD.

1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:05.280
 LSD is more cerebral, longer lasting, not as reassuring in a way as psilocybin.

1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:10.840
 Sometimes he used to say that if they'd never got into LSD, they'd still be at Harvard with

1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:12.840
 the psilocybin.

1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:19.800
 He was a great American psychologist, but then he got tired of the psychology game, you

1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:22.200
 could say, or he would say that.

1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:30.640
 He got more and more interested in cultural change and various musicians and artists and

1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:34.080
 all sorts of people started coming to him for the psychedelic experience that they are

1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:36.400
 in a way, for creativity, for other things.

1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:45.280
 He started hanging out with all sorts of famous people or creative people and he stopped going

1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:56.640
 to classes a lot and Ram Dass, Richard Alpert had given LSD to a student that Ram Dass

1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:02.600
 was courageous enough to admit that he had sexual interest in.

1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:04.520
 They weren't supposed to give it undergraduates.

1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:08.960
 That was about the only time that they ever did it and psychedelics just getting more

1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:13.520
 and more controversial even in the early 60s, eventually got kicked out of Harvard and then

1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:23.720
 he became a cultural icon for the counterculture and was hounded by the police and Nixon and

1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:25.120
 spent a lot of time in jail.

1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:28.360
 He's an incredible person.

1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:36.120
 One thing that Ram Dass said is that Richard Albert Ram Dass said, I'm a rascal but Leary

1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:37.120
 is a scoundrel.

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:40.280
 What's the distinction?

1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:47.040
 A scoundrel is like in good fun, a scoundrel is like you can't quite trust them, I think.

1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:49.960
 Yeah, it's a spectrum of sorts.

1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:57.520
 Yeah, I think that Leary was someone who a little bit got addicted to media attention.

1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:04.640
 But I think that overall he gets blamed a lot for the backlash against the 60s, the shutdown

1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:05.680
 of psychedelic research.

1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:10.160
 I think that he is unfairly blamed for a lot of that.

1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:16.640
 I think when you look back at the 60s, the common narrative is that it was because psychedelics

1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:18.000
 going wrong.

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.840
 People took psychedelics, they weren't prepared, they had emotional breakdowns, they went psychotic,

1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:27.040
 they killed themselves, they did this or that, different problems of people taking psychedelics

1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:33.480
 in context that they didn't feel fairly safe in or just they weren't prepared or they didn't

1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:35.160
 know how much they were taking or all this.

1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:41.360
 So the backlash was because psychedelics going wrong, but I think the real reason, well,

1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:42.600
 that did happen.

1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:48.000
 I think the real reason is psychedelics going right and people having this sense of connection

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:54.440
 and then the opposite of what the CIA was hoping that it would turn people inward and

1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:59.320
 take them away from political struggles, it actually motivated people.

1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:05.040
 Once you actually have these psychedelic experiences, your attitude towards death changes also.

1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:10.320
 This idea of death becoming an intrinsic part of life, it's a natural cycle.

1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:12.160
 It's not so much.

1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:19.520
 So I think people realize that while there's this billions of years of evolution, infinity,

1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:23.040
 whatever that means in terms of time, that we're here for a very limited time and they

1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:27.240
 end up wanting to use their time well, they have a lessened fear of death and they want

1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:31.280
 to build this paradise on earth here now instead of later.

1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:37.280
 So a lot of people really did get motivated to challenge the Vietnam War to work on the

1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:42.400
 environmental movement, civil rights movement, women's rights movement, anti militarism.

1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:46.440
 And it was that challenge to the status quo that caused the backlash.

1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:53.000
 So Leary is someone who in 1990, we had a, now maps, I started in 86.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:58.440
 So in 1990, we had this conference to raise money out in California and Leary was there

1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:02.080
 and Ram Dass was there and Ralph Metzner was there and Nandi Wao was there and Terrence

1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:04.920
 McKenna was there and Dennis McKenna was there and all these.

1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:11.760
 But there was one point where Tim was speaking and afterwards I was asking him some questions

1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:17.640
 and I said, do you have any advice for us on how to work with the government and how

1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:19.720
 to bring these psychedelics forward?

1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:20.720
 That's what we're trying to do.

1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:22.760
 I've got this nonprofit for it.

1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:24.080
 We're trying to do this research.

1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:29.440
 What is your advice on how to bring this forward and how to work with the government?

1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:33.080
 And he said, fuck the government.

1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:39.600
 He said, I am so far past asking for permission for anything, but I'm glad that you're doing

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:40.840
 it.

1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:44.400
 And then he held up my hand like, you know, like passing the torch.

1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:45.400
 Wow.

1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:49.000
 So it was, and that's one of my favorite photographs of me and Tim where he's sort of like, but

1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:50.640
 it was the after this, fuck the government.

1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:55.520
 And I'm so far past asking for permission for anything, but I'm glad that you are now.

1:14:55.520 --> 1:15:00.040
 I did followups to the Good Friday experiment and I did followups 25 year followup to the

1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:06.080
 Good Friday experiment, about a 34 year followup to the Concord Prison experiment.

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:10.200
 What I discovered in some ways I would say is the key to the sixties, what I just told

1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:14.120
 you, but in the followup to the Good Friday experiment that I did in the eighties for

1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:18.640
 my undergraduate thesis at New College in Sarasota, Florida.

1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:21.000
 I eventually found 19 out of the 20 people.

1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.880
 It was just, it was, that was an enormous challenge because their names were all lost

1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:29.360
 and just took forever, years and years and years to find them all.

1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:34.400
 But I discovered that those people that had the psilocybin experience in the midst of 25

1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:39.640
 years later with Nancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan, and if there ever were there a social pressure

1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:44.320
 to disavow the validity of the psychedelic experience, that was then.

1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:51.680
 And instead they affirmed it, that they thought with all of this years of hindsight now looking

1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:55.080
 back, they thought it was a valid mystical experience.

1:15:55.080 --> 1:16:04.240
 But I discovered that one of the persons who had the psilocybin had this experience during

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:09.160
 the Good Friday service that Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister.

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:13.360
 He was Martin Luther King's mentor and Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister at Boston

1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:16.400
 at Marsh Chapel.

1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:20.720
 Martin Luther King got his PhD at Boston University.

1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:24.480
 And Howard Thurman had spent time with Gandhi.

1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:29.480
 And so he was really kind of this hidden person behind the civil rights movement about nonviolence

1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:31.320
 as their strategy.

1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:34.560
 But he was interested in the political implications of the mystical experience.

1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:37.720
 So he permitted this experiment to take place.

1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:42.920
 And there were 20 Divinity students from Andorra Newton in the basement and 10 experimenters,

1:16:42.920 --> 1:16:47.880
 all the people on religion and psychology, like Houston Smith and Maltrys and Clark and

1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:52.080
 Leary and Rom Desmond and others were there as a support part of it.

1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:54.720
 And the sermon was like three hours later.

1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:59.280
 We actually have a three hours long, we actually have the original sermon from the Good Friday

1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:02.440
 experiment from Howard Thurman up on our website.

1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:03.440
 It's incredible.

1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:06.320
 But part of it was tell people there's a man on the cross.

1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:11.160
 And this one person sort of heard that and he thought, okay, I got to do that.

1:17:11.160 --> 1:17:15.320
 And Howard Thurman was such a dynamic speaker and he said, I got to tell people there's

1:17:15.320 --> 1:17:16.960
 a man on the cross.

1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:20.680
 And so he said, what am I doing here in this basement chapel listening to the service?

1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:22.200
 I got to go tell people there's a man on the cross.

1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:25.320
 So he went, they thought he was just going to the bathroom, but he ran out the door.

1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:31.720
 He's running down Commonwealth Avenue and Houston Smith and Tim Leary go after him.

1:17:31.720 --> 1:17:36.200
 And he had thought that since he should tell somebody, he should tell the president.

1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:38.400
 Like why not?

1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:42.400
 And then he realized, well, the president's in Washington, you know, here in Boston, I'll

1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:44.360
 just tell the president of the university.

1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:49.280
 So anyways, running down the street and Leary and Houston Smith go after him and he doesn't

1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:50.280
 want to go back inside.

1:17:50.280 --> 1:17:51.280
 They finally get him.

1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:53.680
 He's not hit by a car.

1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:57.480
 But they end up giving him a shot of Thorazine.

1:17:57.480 --> 1:17:58.480
 What's Thorazine?

1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:06.800
 Thorazine is like a major anti psychotic drug, it's a horrible drug, but it knocks people

1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:08.760
 out, tranquilizes them.

1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:11.080
 We would never do that today.

1:18:11.080 --> 1:18:14.360
 We don't abort a difficult experience like that.

1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:15.720
 But in any case, they hid that.

1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:20.120
 That was not part of the write up of this experiment.

1:18:20.120 --> 1:18:25.280
 So what they did is, in a sense, a little bit exaggerated the benefits, it later became

1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:29.320
 out three years later after the experiment or four years in Time Magazine, it said everybody

1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:31.720
 that got psilocybin had a mystical experience.

1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:37.880
 It wasn't true, not everybody, eight out of the 10 did, but not all 10, not this guy.

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:41.040
 And they minimized the risks.

1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:42.040
 So there was a bit of that.

1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:47.000
 I think Tim was reckless in that way, was underplayed the risks and over promised the

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:48.520
 benefits.

1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:55.720
 And then the Concord Prison experiment, it turned out that Tim had fudged the data completely

1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:58.000
 and it wasn't really successful.

1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:02.280
 So I faulted him for that, but the outside world was doing the opposite.

1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:06.200
 It was exaggerating the risks and blocking research.

1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:12.360
 So he felt justified to fudge the data because the outside world was fudging in a sense,

1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:14.520
 the response to the...

1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:16.280
 Yeah, exactly.

1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:21.920
 So that presents a very nice context.

1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:28.560
 Not the government, but I'm glad that somebody is fighting the good fight from within and

1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:33.080
 doing it the right way, which is where you are.

1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:41.440
 So the 80s, let me ask, what is MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic

1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:46.520
 Studies, and what is its mission throughout the years, throughout the decades?

1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:47.520
 Yeah.

1:19:47.520 --> 1:19:49.960
 So MAPS is a nonprofit organization.

1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:53.880
 I created it as a nonprofit pharmaceutical company.

1:19:53.880 --> 1:20:01.680
 I created it in 86 after DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, criminalized MDMA in 1985.

1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:06.000
 And that was after they started trying to do that in 1984.

1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:12.360
 And as I mentioned, this Terence McKenna's motivating us to do this safety study.

1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:17.880
 So we did that in preparation for this eventual crackdown because MDMA was called Adam, used

1:20:17.880 --> 1:20:22.640
 as a therapy drug, but it was also beginning to be sold as ecstasy as a party drug.

1:20:22.640 --> 1:20:25.720
 And that was taking place in public settings and bars.

1:20:25.720 --> 1:20:29.200
 And so it was inevitable that the crackdown would happen.

1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:35.560
 And so I had a nonprofit connected to Buckminster Fuller, Earth Metabolic Design Lab, that

1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:41.280
 we used to support this lawsuit against the DEA to block them from criminalizing MDMA.

1:20:41.280 --> 1:20:45.160
 We were winning in the court of public opinion and winning in the court.

1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:49.760
 The DEA freaked out and the emergency scheduled MDMA in 85.

1:20:49.760 --> 1:20:53.600
 The handwriting was on the wall that they were not going to permit the therapeutic use

1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:56.520
 to continue because it gets in the way of the narrative of the drug war.

1:20:56.520 --> 1:20:58.480
 And these are terrible drugs.

1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:04.920
 So in 86 is when I started MAPS as a nonprofit pharma because the strategy that I realized

1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:13.240
 is that Americans are open to medicines, you know, that tools to ease suffering.

1:21:13.240 --> 1:21:17.440
 That was the opening wedge, the opening door to changing attitudes.

1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:22.160
 And it would be through science, I would say that my religion is more science than anything

1:21:22.160 --> 1:21:23.160
 else.

1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:24.160
 Yes.

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:31.920
 And, you know, culture and religion are metaphorical, but often too much, they become literal, but

1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:36.720
 I felt that through science, through medicine, there would be a way to bring these drugs

1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:38.080
 back to the surface.

1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:42.400
 And the mission was always this mass mental health.

1:21:42.400 --> 1:21:46.640
 This idea that what we need is to spiritualize humanity.

1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:52.320
 Einstein said the splitting of the atom has changed everything except our mode of thinking.

1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:59.200
 And hence we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe, which shall be required if mankind is to survive

1:21:59.200 --> 1:22:02.480
 as a whole new mode of thinking.

1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:06.960
 So what is that new mode of thinking?

1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:14.120
 My presumption is that it's more of this mystical sense of thinking that we're all connected.

1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:17.560
 And then if we realize that we're all connected, we're not going to blow up the world.

1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:22.520
 So a lot of people say that, you know, if we could just give LSD all to the world leaders,

1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:26.000
 that would be, you know, then they'd have these spiritual experiences, the world would

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:27.000
 be better.

1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:30.680
 But actually I had a ketamine experience the day after that DMT experience I described

1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:32.240
 with the inner Hitler.

1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:37.240
 This ketamine experience was, I was above and behind Hitler as he was giving a speech

1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:40.360
 like in the Nuremberg rallies kind of thing.

1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:42.360
 And I was trying to think, how do I get into his head?

1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:45.080
 How do I undo what he wants to do?

1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:47.320
 How can we deal with him?

1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:51.600
 And I realized this whole new thing about the Heil Hitler salute and, you know, he

1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:55.800
 would like push energy out and then everybody would do the salute back to him.

1:22:55.800 --> 1:22:59.160
 And so it's like the one to the many and the many to the one giving all these people giving

1:22:59.160 --> 1:23:03.440
 away their power and then how it would just sort of ratchet up in intensity, like these

1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:05.320
 vibrations.

1:23:05.320 --> 1:23:07.520
 And I realized there's no way to get into his head.

1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:11.040
 This idea we've talked about before about, you have to be willing.

1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:16.520
 So what that sort of helped me understand is that the strategy has to be mass mental

1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:17.520
 health.

1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:18.520
 It's not about changing a few leaders.

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:23.960
 We need to change the mass of humanity to this new mode of thinking, this new spiritual

1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:24.960
 way.

1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:30.800
 The maps was a nonprofit pharmaceutical company focused on psychedelics.

1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:32.440
 Big Pharma wasn't doing this work.

1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:33.960
 Government wasn't funding it.

1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:37.200
 So the only source of funds I thought would be through nonprofit donations.

1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:40.080
 And that's been true up until just a couple of years ago now that we have the rise of

1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:45.080
 these for profits, but that's because we've cleared out the regulatory obstacles.

1:23:45.080 --> 1:23:49.400
 We've got more scientific data about the benefits funded through philanthropy.

1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:53.920
 We've changed public opinion and there's a lot less zeal for the drug war.

1:23:53.920 --> 1:23:55.320
 So all of those things have changed.

1:23:55.320 --> 1:24:00.120
 But at the time it was mass mental health was the goal, two tracks.

1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:01.600
 One was drug development.

1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:03.880
 The other was drug policy reform.

1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:08.720
 So then it's not just available to people to have a clinical diagnosis, but people who

1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:13.920
 are personal growth or, you know, they should have access to it as well.

1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:20.640
 I did not know at the time that no drug had ever been made into a medicine by a nonprofit.

1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:22.320
 That was really good.

1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:23.320
 I didn't know that.

1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:26.160
 It might have been a little bit more daunted.

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:28.480
 And actually that didn't happen for 13 more years.

1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:31.040
 It happened in 1999.

1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:37.200
 And that was the abortion pill, RU46, that was approved in Europe, but it controversial.

1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:39.480
 No pharmaceutical company would take it.

1:24:39.480 --> 1:24:43.680
 And it was John D. Rockefeller III through the Population Council with the major donor

1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:49.480
 being Warren Buffett and the Rockefellers and the Buffetts and some of the Pritzkers

1:24:49.480 --> 1:24:52.480
 were involved in funding this.

1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:54.440
 So that was the first nonprofit.

1:24:54.440 --> 1:25:03.520
 But the maps was designed as from the very beginning, not academic research into psychedelics,

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:04.520
 but drug development.

1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:06.400
 And that's a fundamental distinction.

1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:11.640
 And that's why I think we're years ahead now of everybody else in terms of making a psychedelic

1:25:11.640 --> 1:25:14.040
 assisted therapy into a medicine.

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:18.160
 Because our goal from the very beginning was not knowledge, not academic research.

1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:19.160
 It was practical.

1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:20.160
 It was drug development.

1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:22.520
 How do we create new social structures?

1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:25.240
 How do we create legal access to these things?

1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:32.000
 Now in December of 2014, we created the Maps Public Benefit Corporation.

1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:41.760
 So Maps is a nonprofit, but in our 35 years, we've raised about $110 million in donations.

1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:46.960
 What I didn't know when I started Maps, and it took me quite a few years, I didn't even

1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:54.400
 know this till about eight, nine years ago, was that in 1984, Ronald Reagan had signed

1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:58.920
 a bill to create incentives for developing drugs that were off patent.

1:25:58.920 --> 1:26:02.200
 So MDMA was invented by Merck in 1912.

1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:03.840
 It's in the public domain.

1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:07.840
 These incentives are called data exclusivity, which means that if you make a drug into a

1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:13.520
 medicine that does no patent protection, nobody can use your data for a period of time to

1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:17.480
 market a generic, and that will effectively be, well, it's five years.

1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:23.000
 You do pediatric studies, you get six months extension, and we are being required if we

1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:26.600
 succeed in adults to work with adolescents with PTSD.

1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:30.880
 It blocks a generic competitor from applying for, until that five and a half years is over,

1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:33.160
 takes FDA at least six months to review.

1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:38.920
 So more or less six years of data exclusivity, 10 years in Europe is data exclusivity.

1:26:38.920 --> 1:26:44.120
 So the story then became to the donors that you're not going to have to give us money

1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:51.280
 forever because we can make money selling MDMA, but we want to do two revolutionary things,

1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:52.280
 you could say.

1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:56.520
 One is psychedelic assisted psychotherapy, but the other is marketing drugs.

1:26:56.520 --> 1:27:01.680
 When you market it with the profit maximization motive, we end up in the extreme getting the

1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:06.640
 distortions that we have in America, where we have the most expensive healthcare system

1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:11.080
 in the world per capita, but our outcomes are down like 40 or 50 among the countries,

1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:12.080
 our average outcomes.

1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:17.520
 We don't have third of the people or so don't have insurance, and it's just very inequitable.

1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:23.680
 So what we're trying to do is show a different way to market drugs, and it's a modification

1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:29.640
 of capitalism is called the benefit corporation, where you maximize public benefit, not profit.

1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:31.440
 You still make a profit.

1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:36.800
 So selling MDMA for a profit is not something we could keep inside the nonprofit because

1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:39.640
 it's taxable, it's a business.

1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:45.240
 So we've created the maps public benefit corporation, which is 100% owned by the nonprofit.

1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:49.600
 So we have a nonprofit that owns a pharma company.

1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:54.640
 And the mission of that pharma company is to maximize not profit but maximize benefit

1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:55.640
 for society.

1:27:55.640 --> 1:27:56.640
 Yeah.

1:27:56.640 --> 1:27:57.640
 Yeah.

1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:01.240
 Although there still will be profits and the profits that we're going to make are going

1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:06.360
 to be used towards the mission of maps, which is again, is this mass mental health and ending

1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:08.200
 the drug war.

1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:13.680
 And in fact, we've hired the Boston Consulting Group to help us plot our commercialization

1:28:13.680 --> 1:28:15.520
 strategy.

1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:20.040
 And so there is some suggestions based, there's so many different assumptions in this, the

1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:25.200
 number of therapists that we train, the price that we set for the MDMA, whether insurance

1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:27.600
 companies will cover it.

1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:32.280
 But there's the possibility of somewhere in the range of three quarters of a billion dollars

1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:39.560
 in profits during this period of data exclusivity, just from the US.

1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:43.040
 And we're talking about the, trying to do this research around the world as well.

1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:45.120
 So that's what the benefit corporation is.

1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:47.640
 The benefit corporation is our pharmaceutical arm.

1:28:47.640 --> 1:28:53.160
 We're about 130 people now, somewhere in that fluctuates, but a one third of them are in

1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:54.160
 the nonprofit.

1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:57.880
 We do harm reduction, psychedelic harm reduction.

1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:05.240
 We help create programs for people with difficult psychedelic experiences at Burning Man, at

1:29:05.240 --> 1:29:07.480
 festivals all over the world, even in cities.

1:29:07.480 --> 1:29:13.520
 We're now negotiating with the police, the city of Denver, because Denver has made the

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:16.480
 mushrooms the lowest enforcement priority.

1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:19.000
 We organ is past the organ psilocybin initiative.

1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:23.080
 So in those areas where maybe more people are going to gravitate to do psychedelics,

1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:27.640
 we want there to be harm reduction so that we don't have bad stories coming out that

1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:29.200
 would change that.

1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:31.080
 So maps does the psychedelic harm reduction.

1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:32.580
 We do public education.

1:29:32.580 --> 1:29:33.580
 We do a lot of it.

1:29:33.580 --> 1:29:35.080
 That's what you and I are doing right now.

1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:37.080
 We're doing that now.

1:29:37.080 --> 1:29:40.400
 So but also research towards.

1:29:40.400 --> 1:29:43.080
 Well the research now is done in the benefit corp.

1:29:43.080 --> 1:29:44.080
 In the benefit corp.

1:29:44.080 --> 1:29:45.080
 Yeah.

1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:48.520
 So what happens is people donate to maps, get a tax deduction, maps transfers the money,

1:29:48.520 --> 1:29:51.320
 or you could say invests in the benefit corp.

1:29:51.320 --> 1:29:56.240
 The benefit corp will do the research and then maps is the sponsor, but then we will

1:29:56.240 --> 1:29:58.480
 license the sale of MD made to the benefit corp.

1:29:58.480 --> 1:29:59.480
 So.

1:29:59.480 --> 1:30:00.480
 Got it.

1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:03.840
 But the research are done with an eye towards creating something that has a big impact versus

1:30:03.840 --> 1:30:05.880
 just research for knowledge sake.

1:30:05.880 --> 1:30:06.880
 Yeah.

1:30:06.880 --> 1:30:07.880
 Yeah.

1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:12.400
 Because I'm interested in political change.

1:30:12.400 --> 1:30:18.440
 You can, the other part of it and which is that the brain is the most complex thing we

1:30:18.440 --> 1:30:22.400
 know in the, in the universe, it's going to, it's endless.

1:30:22.400 --> 1:30:26.160
 I mean, when are we going to really like this idea of will we figure out telepathy?

1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:29.120
 Will we figure out tapping into the clock of unconscious?

1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:31.000
 What is the extensive of our brain?

1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:32.400
 You know, how does the brain actually work?

1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:33.760
 Do you ask chemistry questions?

1:30:33.760 --> 1:30:38.080
 You know, so if it's just the pursuit of knowledge, that is an endless thing.

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:39.600
 And how does that end the drug war?

1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:41.280
 How does that help people directly?

1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:46.240
 So that's why we're focused on drug development more than mechanism of action.

1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:53.040
 Before I ask you about one, but several really exciting studies, let me ask sort of a personal

1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:54.920
 question for me.

1:30:54.920 --> 1:31:05.400
 So if I wanted to get psychedelics from the Maps Public Benefit Corporation and explore

1:31:05.400 --> 1:31:10.960
 my own mind, how do I get to do that and when?

1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:12.280
 You won't be able to.

1:31:12.280 --> 1:31:13.280
 You'll never be able to.

1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:14.280
 This is very unfortunate.

1:31:14.280 --> 1:31:20.320
 But the reason is because the Benefit Corp is designed as a pharmaceutical company.

1:31:20.320 --> 1:31:23.920
 So we can only work on clinical indication.

1:31:23.920 --> 1:31:27.280
 So let's say you come to me and you just say, oh, I'm really depressed.

1:31:27.280 --> 1:31:32.800
 Can I get MDMA to overcome my depression or overcome my PTSD?

1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:35.960
 You know, we'll have to do research in those indications.

1:31:35.960 --> 1:31:38.320
 And by when you say me, you mean like a doctor.

1:31:38.320 --> 1:31:43.520
 So this would be prescribed in theory by doctors or this would go through a doctor and a prescription.

1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:44.520
 Okay.

1:31:44.520 --> 1:31:46.560
 Let me ask another question.

1:31:46.560 --> 1:31:47.760
 To further answer that.

1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:51.320
 So that's where the drug policy arm comes in, the drug policy reform.

1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:56.720
 So you should be able to get access to psychedelics for your own personal growth.

1:31:56.720 --> 1:31:59.320
 But that's not medicine.

1:31:59.320 --> 1:32:05.520
 So that's why we need to medicalize, to have things covered by insurance, to change people's

1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:07.600
 attitudes, the public attitudes.

1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:12.160
 And then we get this subsequent drug policy reform.

1:32:12.160 --> 1:32:14.840
 And we're talking about it in terms of licensed legalization.

1:32:14.840 --> 1:32:19.440
 So my view is you should get a license to do psychedelics, you get a little education

1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:21.960
 stuff and then you should be able to buy it and do it on your own.

1:32:21.960 --> 1:32:24.280
 So let me rephrase the question in more specifically.

1:32:24.280 --> 1:32:30.360
 So when can I, if I happen to have ailments of some kind where the doctor decides that

1:32:30.360 --> 1:32:32.160
 psychedelics could help?

1:32:32.160 --> 1:32:37.440
 When would you be a loose estimate for you of when a doctor will be able to prescribe

1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:43.920
 to me something from MAP's public benefit code, and then when for my personal growth

1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:46.480
 and creativity, would I be able to get something?

1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:50.800
 So like just looking out, this isn't like guaranteed, but like your vision, your hope

1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:56.160
 for, yeah, for psychedelics in society.

1:32:56.160 --> 1:33:02.560
 Well the end of 2023, so two and a half years from now, we anticipate FDA approval for the

1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:06.480
 prescription use of MDMA for PTSD.

1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:13.640
 Because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine, there is what's called off label

1:33:13.640 --> 1:33:14.880
 prescription.

1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:16.960
 What that means, the label is what it's approved for.

1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:20.480
 So the label says, this is approved for PTSD.

1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:24.760
 But let's say you come in anything else, social anxiety or whatever, you can go to the doctor,

1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:28.640
 they can give it to you, it might not be covered by insurance, they have to be a little bit

1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:30.760
 careful about malpractice.

1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:35.000
 But I think the end of 2023 is when you will be able to do that.

1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:41.480
 Now there's actually another program very limited called expanded access, which is compassionate

1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:47.120
 use, which means that, and we have approval for 50 people for compassionate use right

1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:49.160
 now, we think that'll grow.

1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:51.480
 So that's going to open up in about two months.

1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:55.680
 And so those are people with PTSD, they have to be treatment resistant, nothing has worked

1:33:55.680 --> 1:34:02.040
 for them, and they can access MDMA while we're doing the phase three studies.

1:34:02.040 --> 1:34:03.880
 But they have to pay for it themselves.

1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:08.720
 We're not the sponsor has to pay for all the research, but expanded access, because there's

1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:13.040
 no control group, everybody gets the MDMA, people can pay for it themselves.

1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:15.560
 And we think that'll start in a couple of months.

1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:17.880
 But it's very limited, it's limited to certain cities.

1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:23.960
 There's also a program called write to try, which is passed through Congress.

1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:30.000
 It's similar to this idea of compassionate use, but it cuts the FDA out of it and patients

1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:35.880
 can negotiate directly with pharma companies to get access to their drugs.

1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:40.800
 That's starting to happen, I think in Canada now they're letting people have compassionate

1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:45.960
 access to psilocybin for life threatening illness, because there has been studies with

1:34:45.960 --> 1:34:49.840
 psilocybin for cancer patients and others with life threatening illness.

1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:54.720
 As far as your question about when will you be able to access this for personal growth

1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:56.840
 outside of medicine?

1:34:56.840 --> 1:35:01.120
 I'll take that to mean fully legally, where you can just go buy pure drugs somewhere,

1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:02.360
 when will that happen?

1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:09.480
 We already are starting to see the decriminalization in certain areas of plants, psychedelics.

1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:15.400
 And we see overall drug decrym, like that passed in Oregon, so that any drug is now,

1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:21.080
 it's not legal, you can't really fully set up clinics to offer it to people or there's

1:35:21.080 --> 1:35:24.360
 no legal supply like that, but it's decriminalized.

1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:29.520
 So my sense of things is based a lot on watching what happened with medical marijuana and marijuana

1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:30.520
 legalization.

1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:34.720
 So we're sitting here in Massachusetts where marijuana is legal, but what happened first

1:35:34.720 --> 1:35:36.460
 was medical marijuana.

1:35:36.460 --> 1:35:43.440
 So what we see is that medicalization by demonstrating that under certain contexts,

1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:49.480
 the risks are much less than the benefits, and then there are benefits.

1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:53.800
 And then people hear stories about people that had gotten better, and then that changes

1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:57.640
 their minds, and then eventually that builds up to, why are we throwing people in jail

1:35:57.640 --> 1:35:58.640
 for this?

1:35:58.640 --> 1:35:59.640
 Because the culture, yeah.

1:35:59.640 --> 1:36:00.640
 Yeah.

1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:07.200
 So I think that what we're going to have 2023 is MDMA approved by the FDA, chances are.

1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:10.120
 psilocybin will be a year or two after that.

1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:13.760
 Then what we're going to need is a decade of psychedelic clinics that are going to roll

1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:20.160
 out across America, also other countries as well, thousands of these psychedelic clinics.

1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:26.400
 We already have hundreds of ketamine clinics that are a ketamine for depression.

1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:29.560
 More and more people are realizing that ketamine, when it's used with therapy, it's better

1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:31.720
 than when it's not.

1:36:31.720 --> 1:36:34.240
 But the therapists want to be psychedelic therapists.

1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:36.800
 They don't want to be a ketamine therapist or an MDMA therapist.

1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:38.520
 So those will be cross trained.

1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:42.320
 So we will have a decade of these thousands of psychedelic clinics and all these stories

1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:48.520
 of people getting better in 2035 is when I think that we will move to licensed legalization,

1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:53.320
 which is when you will have the option of just going somewhere.

1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:59.160
 Once you've done this educational stuff, potentially, I also think it would be better to have the

1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:04.480
 opportunity for people to go for free, paid for by tax money to these clinics.

1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:08.240
 And you have your first experience with psychedelics under supervision.

1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:13.120
 And you know what you're getting into, you've, you know, to ask the questionnaire what the

1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:15.880
 risks are with the drugs, then you get your license.

1:37:15.880 --> 1:37:18.160
 So 2035 is when I think that'll happen.

1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:20.760
 And the clinics will be sites of these initiations.

1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:21.760
 Yes.

1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:23.080
 And so it'll be a safe environment.

1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:27.720
 Just like you said, all the things that are actually maximize the likelihood of a pleasant

1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:30.400
 experience and all those kinds of things.

1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:33.000
 It is a frustratingly slow process.

1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:40.160
 And the FDA being part of that process is very frustrating that, of course, there's benefits,

1:37:40.160 --> 1:37:43.880
 but boy, well, I wish it could move a lot faster.

1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:44.880
 Yeah.

1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:53.040
 The thing that I've learned from being a parent is that when you have little kids, it seems

1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:55.480
 like they'll be with you forever.

1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:59.560
 But then when they grow up and they go to college and they leave, do you look back and

1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:02.080
 like, where did that 20 years go?

1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:03.080
 Yeah.

1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:08.120
 You know, so we're still dealing with the legacy of the civil war and slavery in America.

1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:11.640
 So actually a 20 year plan is not that long.

1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:19.240
 So while we say it's frustratingly slow, and it is, you know, I mean, it's 50 years

1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:21.560
 since the psychedelic 60s.

1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:29.160
 And, you know, right now it's, you know, it's 36 years since MDMA was criminalized.

1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:33.880
 And you think about all those people that committed suicide from PTSD or from anything

1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:39.960
 else, and all those people that could have been helped if the DEA had accepted the administrative

1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:43.600
 law judge recommendation at MDMA stay in schedule three.

1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:45.440
 It's tremendously sad.

1:38:45.440 --> 1:38:50.000
 At the same time, culture evolves slowly, you know, you read the Bible or you read all

1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:53.400
 this stuff, we're not that different from people thousands of years ago.

1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:58.840
 So how are we going to really evolve enough over the next couple of decades so we don't

1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:01.720
 destroy the planet and don't kill each other?

1:39:01.720 --> 1:39:05.440
 That's why I think psychedelics have an important role to play.

1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:07.920
 That's why I've devoted my life to psychedelics.

1:39:07.920 --> 1:39:13.880
 And it is frustratingly slow, and what I said to myself is our whole effort has not been

1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:14.880
 fast enough.

1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:18.800
 Can we talk a little bit about PTSD and MDMA?

1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:26.640
 There's this fascinating paper, came out on a fascinating study that you're a part of.

1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:28.280
 That's a phase three study.

1:39:28.280 --> 1:39:29.640
 Can you describe what the study is?

1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:31.520
 Can you describe what phase three means?

1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:37.880
 Can you describe what the findings are and why it's, in fact, so important and impact

1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:38.880
 for?

1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:43.640
 Yeah, this study came out May 10th in nature medicine, so one of the highest impact factors

1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:46.280
 in medicine, journals, it was tremendous.

1:39:46.280 --> 1:39:52.600
 So to make a drug and do a medicine, the first thing you need to do is what are called non

1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:57.360
 clinical or preclinical studies, meaning safety established in animals.

1:39:57.360 --> 1:39:58.600
 What does the drug do?

1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:00.160
 What are the side effects in animals?

1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:01.320
 Where do you see the risks?

1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:05.840
 And then you negotiate with FDA to do phase one studies.

1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:11.040
 And phase one studies are where you move from animals to humans, and those are more safety

1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:16.520
 studies and trying to describe what the drug does so that you can determine if there is

1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:19.520
 potential medical value there.

1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:29.480
 Certain drugs like cancer drugs are so toxic that you don't have phase one studies in healthy

1:40:29.480 --> 1:40:30.480
 volunteers.

1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:36.120
 That's like phase one slash two, where you bring in the patients, but you still are doing

1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:40.160
 sort of dose response safety studies, but you use patients.

1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:43.320
 But most phase one studies are healthy volunteers.

1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:48.920
 Phase two are where you start bringing in the patients and you start experimenting with

1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:49.920
 various different things.

1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:53.680
 The purpose of phase two is really just to design phase three.

1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:58.640
 Now again, I'm sort of putting out of the picture in another area is mechanism of action.

1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:00.280
 How do these drugs work?

1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:06.120
 Phase two, you're trying to figure out what they do, who your patient population is.

1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:07.120
 What are the risks?

1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:08.120
 Who do you include?

1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:09.360
 Who do you exclude?

1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:10.360
 What are the doses?

1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:11.920
 What is your treatment?

1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:14.960
 What are your measures?

1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:19.600
 In our case, it was how do you do a double blind study?

1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:21.760
 That was a big part of phase two.

1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:24.320
 That's a big challenge for psychedelic drugs.

1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:29.000
 Any kind of drugs that have a real strong effect, how do you do a double blind study?

1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:34.360
 Triple blind study to interrupt would mean that the patient should know, should not be

1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:37.640
 aware whether it's placebo or not.

1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:38.640
 And the research.

1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:40.640
 And the research is not aware.

1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:44.240
 And so for that lack of awareness, when the effect is really strong, it's very difficult

1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:46.880
 to do on both the research and the patient side.

1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:47.880
 Yes.

1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:50.640
 And sometimes they talk about triple blind.

1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:55.480
 So the other part is the raters that evaluate the symptoms and before and after.

1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:57.080
 So you ideally want triple blind.

1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:02.720
 You want the patients, the researchers and the evaluators of the outcomes and all of

1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:07.400
 them not to know what the drug, whether it was drug or placebo, and that's to reduce

1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:09.600
 experiment or bias.

1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:13.440
 So and then, then you move to phase three.

1:42:13.440 --> 1:42:17.960
 Once you've figured out how to design the phase three studies and phase three are the

1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:24.080
 large scaled multi site placebo controlled double blind studies where you must prove

1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:30.040
 safety and efficacy in order to get permission to market the drug.

1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:36.160
 Now for us, when we started maps in 86, as I said, it was one year after the criminalization

1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:43.160
 of MDMA in 85, we had five different protocols that were rejected by the FDA for studying

1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:44.280
 with MDMA.

1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:47.080
 And these were all various phase one studies.

1:42:47.080 --> 1:42:52.040
 They came from Harvard, from UC San Francisco, from the University of Arizona and Albuquerque

1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:59.600
 New Mexico all over, and they were all rejected 1992, six years after we started, we got the

1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:03.320
 first permission for phase one.

1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:06.040
 And that took us through much of the nineties.

1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:11.000
 Again, things are slow because we have to raise the money through donations.

1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:16.440
 And then in 1999 is when we started to work with PTSD.

1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:26.200
 And that then took us till November 29, 2016, which is when we had the end of phase two

1:43:26.200 --> 1:43:27.560
 meeting with FDA.

1:43:27.560 --> 1:43:33.520
 So it took 30 years from the start of maps to the end of phase two meeting with FDA.

1:43:33.520 --> 1:43:40.600
 And what we had discovered during phase two was several different key points.

1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:47.040
 The drugs that are available right now for PTSD, the SSRIs, Zoloft and Paxil, that have

1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:51.840
 been approved by FDA and regulators in Europe as well, the European Medicines Agency for

1:43:51.840 --> 1:44:00.240
 PTSD, they work better in women than in men, and they failed in combat related PTSD.

1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:05.480
 So what we learned is that MDMA assisted therapy works just as well in men or women, and it

1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:07.960
 works in combat related PTSD.

1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:10.800
 It works in regardless of the cause of PTSD.

1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:16.480
 We also discovered that even though there are stories that people take MDMA at raves

1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:20.120
 and they dance all night and they overheat and they get hypothermia and they die from

1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:25.920
 overheating, which is true and can happen from pure MDMA, or that sometimes people have

1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:32.040
 heard about needing to cool down and so they drink water and then while they're dancing

1:44:32.040 --> 1:44:35.880
 all night and then they drink too much water and then they dilute their blood and they

1:44:35.880 --> 1:44:38.000
 die from hyponitremia.

1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:42.920
 So there are risks of MDMA, but we discovered that in a therapeutic setting, we can control

1:44:42.920 --> 1:44:46.080
 all those risks, no thing don't happen at all.

1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:50.920
 So we discovered safety, we could demonstrate safety.

1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:57.200
 We also figured out that our measure, the CAHPS, the clinician administered PTSD scale,

1:44:57.200 --> 1:45:01.120
 that it's the gold standard all over the world for measuring PTSD symptoms.

1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:03.800
 It's what the FDA and the EMA require.

1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:09.240
 We discovered that it was a good measure for us and that we could show changes in that.

1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:14.920
 The other big thing that we learned is that, and we haven't mentioned this yet, but the

1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:20.080
 work in the 50s and 60s with LSD and psilocybin and the modern research over the last 20 years

1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:24.600
 with psilocybin and classic psychedelics has demonstrated that there's a link between

1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:29.600
 this mystical experience, this unit of mystical experience and therapeutic outcomes for the

1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:36.600
 treatment of addiction, for working with people's life threatening illnesses, for OCD, for obsessive

1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:41.680
 compulsive disorder, that there's with the classic psychedelics, both in the 50 years

1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:46.560
 ago and then the research now has been that there's a link between the depth of the mystical

1:45:46.560 --> 1:45:49.520
 experience and therapeutic outcome.

1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:55.040
 What we discovered is that that's not the case for MDMA, that people do score fairly

1:45:55.040 --> 1:45:59.960
 high on the scales of mystical experience, not as high as they do with the classic psychedelics,

1:45:59.960 --> 1:46:06.000
 but they do score pretty high on average and a significant number of them have over the

1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:09.280
 cutoff for what would be considered a full mystical experience.

1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:13.760
 So enough to say that we could look at a correlation and we didn't find any.

1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:20.160
 The other thing that we discovered, and this was more humbling, I would say for me personally,

1:46:20.160 --> 1:46:25.600
 is that my dissertation at the Kennedy School, a big part of it was on the regulation of

1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:28.040
 the medical use of psychedelics in marijuana.

1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:32.520
 Big part of my dissertation was how to do the double blind study and I thought I'd solve

1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:38.160
 the problem and I persuaded my dissertation committee that I'd solve the problem and the

1:46:38.160 --> 1:46:44.800
 solution was therapy with low dose MDMA versus therapy with full dose MDMA and everybody

1:46:44.800 --> 1:46:49.320
 knows that they're going to get MDMA, most of these people have never done it before,

1:46:49.320 --> 1:46:55.640
 they'll be confused about is it full dose or low dose and then the challenge is to pick

1:46:55.640 --> 1:47:01.200
 a dose that's high enough so that there is this confusion, but not so high that it's

1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:04.920
 so therapeutic that we can't tell the difference between the groups.

1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:12.160
 So we studied zero, meaning inactive placebo, 25 milligrams, 30 milligrams, 40 milligrams,

1:47:12.160 --> 1:47:18.280
 50 milligrams, 75 milligrams, 100 milligrams, 125 and 150.

1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:24.200
 What we discovered is that my dissertation was wrong and that there is no good solution

1:47:24.200 --> 1:47:27.720
 to the double blind problem.

1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:35.880
 What we found is that, two hour surprise actually, was that 75 milligrams was an effective dose.

1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:41.120
 We didn't think that, I mean, the normal dose is like, full dose is like 125 milligrams,

1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:46.660
 something like that, but 75 milligrams was an effective dose and we discovered that the

1:47:46.660 --> 1:47:54.800
 lower doses, so I was half right, you could say, the doses of 25, 30, 40, 50, they could

1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:59.560
 produce enough confusion that you could say that they were successful at blinding, not

1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:06.080
 perfectly, but enough confusion so that people, therapists couldn't know for sure so that

1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:09.920
 there was this reduction of bias, you could say.

1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:18.720
 But what we discovered, again, to our surprise, was that the low doses made people uncomfortable.

1:48:18.720 --> 1:48:26.160
 They stimulated them, but they didn't reduce the fear and so people still got better with

1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:31.920
 the therapy with low dose MDMA, but if we gave them therapy with inactive placebo, they

1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:37.520
 did even better than if we gave them therapy with low dose MDMA.

1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:43.680
 So we call it an anti therapeutic effect, I don't mean to imply that they got worse,

1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:48.520
 but it made people uncomfortable, people didn't like it, but we would still help them make

1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:50.000
 some progress.

1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:55.360
 So we had the blinding, but what it meant by reducing the effect of therapy with inactive

1:48:55.360 --> 1:49:01.260
 placebo is that it would make it easier for us to find a difference between the two groups.

1:49:01.260 --> 1:49:07.400
 And so the real question is, if you can do it with therapy, why bother add a drug?

1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:12.080
 So we went to the FDA and so this was what we discovered during phase two.

1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:17.880
 We went to the FDA at this end of phase two meeting and we said, we can give you blinding,

1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:22.120
 but it will make it easier for us to find a difference between the two groups.

1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:27.680
 And so we suggest that we do therapy with inactive placebo versus therapy with full

1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:29.640
 dose MDMA.

1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:34.560
 That will cause a problem because most people will be able to tell what they've got.

1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:39.960
 But Tom Lawfarin, a doctor who used to be head of psychiatry products at FDA is our

1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:41.760
 main advisor.

1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:47.520
 So the first thing he said is that the double blind fails in practice a lot, even with SSRIs

1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:51.400
 because there's certain side effects that you have with these drugs and the doctors

1:49:51.400 --> 1:49:55.880
 who are doing these research when you're reporting your side effects, they can say, oh, that's

1:49:55.880 --> 1:49:58.400
 probably you got the active drug instead of the placebo.

1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:04.680
 So the double blind is in theory is terrific, but in practice, it doesn't always work quite

1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:05.960
 as well.

1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:11.400
 And so what Tom said is that there are two main approaches that they think are important

1:50:11.400 --> 1:50:13.320
 to reduce bias.

1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:15.400
 The first one is easy to do.

1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:17.920
 It's called random assignment.

1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:24.320
 So sometimes there are studies where you'll treat a bunch of people with something and

1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:26.800
 some fraction of them will get better and some won't.

1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:30.400
 And then you say, okay, all those who didn't get better, who volunteers to get this new

1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:31.920
 treatment?

1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:33.280
 And then you give them the new treatment.

1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:36.120
 But the people that volunteer are more likely to want to get better.

1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:39.720
 They're not representative sample of everybody that has the disease.

1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:44.920
 So when you have random assignment, everybody is similarly motivated and has meets the same

1:50:44.920 --> 1:50:47.360
 inclusion exclusion criteria.

1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:50.520
 So that's what we told, of course, we need random assignment.

1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:58.680
 The other part was when the bias double blind doesn't work as well, then the system of independent

1:50:58.680 --> 1:51:03.040
 raters is especially important of how you do that.

1:51:03.040 --> 1:51:10.440
 So we have over a pool of raters, over 20 of them, and we do this monthly interrater

1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:15.800
 reliability tests to make sure that they, you know, evaluate this so that they're given

1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:20.200
 a videotape of a PTSD patient and then they're supposed to rate them according to their

1:51:20.200 --> 1:51:21.200
 symptoms.

1:51:21.200 --> 1:51:26.120
 And then we sort of make sure that we've got this calibrated raider pool.

1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:30.480
 And it's all done by Zoom, by telemedicine, and they're randomly assigned to the next

1:51:30.480 --> 1:51:32.720
 person that needs a rating.

1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:34.120
 So you said 20 raters.

1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:35.120
 Yeah.

1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:36.120
 So we've got like 20 raters.

1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:43.200
 And what we want to do is make it so that each raider sees each patient only once, maybe

1:51:43.200 --> 1:51:47.240
 twice, but not tracking them through the study.

1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:51.200
 So that guides to reduce the bias in the raters, that they don't know where this person is

1:51:51.200 --> 1:51:55.280
 in the study.

1:51:55.280 --> 1:52:01.640
 And so there's a fellow, Bob Temple, who's like the old wise man at the FDA, he's been

1:52:01.640 --> 1:52:03.760
 there since 1972.

1:52:03.760 --> 1:52:07.240
 He was in charge of the Office of Science Policy and they brought him into the final

1:52:07.240 --> 1:52:11.960
 meeting of this process where we are trying to design phase three.

1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:18.320
 So once FDA said, yes, you can go to phase three, that was November 29th, 2016, we then

1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:23.360
 negotiated for eight months on the design of phase three and all of the other information

1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:26.800
 is just fascinating is going to need this process of design.

1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:32.840
 Oh, it was, you know, to the extent that I have any artistic creativity, it's in protocol

1:52:32.840 --> 1:52:33.840
 design.

1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:35.840
 I really love that.

1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:36.920
 You enjoy this process.

1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:37.920
 I love it.

1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:41.920
 I love it because it's always tradeoffs and it's, um, yeah, it's, you know, and then

1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:46.440
 I acknowledge, you know, that, that we are all biased and so how do you, there's something

1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:53.320
 beautiful about the scientific process designed to get you to the truth, um, especially when

1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:57.280
 that scientific process is trying to get to the truth of the human organism, which is

1:52:57.280 --> 1:52:58.280
 so complicated.

1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:04.600
 So it's very difficult to, uh, to dissect, to, to, to get the, the, the strong effects.

1:53:04.600 --> 1:53:11.400
 And when you're analyzing, when you have like raters, they're, they're watching a video.

1:53:11.400 --> 1:53:15.160
 So just removing subjectivity from that is very, very challenging.

1:53:15.160 --> 1:53:16.160
 Yeah.

1:53:16.160 --> 1:53:18.920
 Very, very much so.

1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:24.160
 And so we came to this agreement with FDA though, that, that we would, um, use this,

1:53:24.160 --> 1:53:31.360
 uh, independent radar pool and, um, and so we learned in phase two again that the double

1:53:31.360 --> 1:53:35.640
 blind, there was no solution to the double blind problem and, and both the FDA and the

1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:41.000
 European medicines agency in the end agreed that the best design was therapy with inactive

1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:45.680
 placebo versus therapy with full dose MDMA, accepting the fact that most people will be

1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:50.480
 able to tell what, whether they got nothing or they got full dose MDMA.

1:53:50.480 --> 1:53:55.960
 Most therapists will be able to tell the difference, but, um, that makes a harder test for us to

1:53:55.960 --> 1:54:00.320
 show a difference between the two groups because we're giving them inactive placebo and not

1:54:00.320 --> 1:54:04.080
 the anti therapeutic effect of low dose MDMA.

1:54:04.080 --> 1:54:10.480
 So once we started phase three, so then we were able to start, um, in 2018 phase three

1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:16.760
 and the paper in nature medicine that just came out was the results of our first phase

1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:18.280
 three study.

1:54:18.280 --> 1:54:22.840
 We came to agreement with FDA that we would do two phase three studies.

1:54:22.840 --> 1:54:26.160
 Each would have 100 persons in them.

1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:33.400
 And what the FDA said to us is that they thought that we could prove efficacy with smaller numbers

1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:36.520
 than they wanted to see for safety.

1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:41.480
 The reason they said that is it in phase two, we had a large effect size.

1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:47.160
 So from a statistical point of view, the bigger of an effect that you're looking for, the

1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:51.480
 fewer number of people you need to get statistical significance.

1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:56.640
 When you're trying to find small differences, you need large numbers of people to sort of

1:54:56.640 --> 1:54:58.680
 work out the noise.

1:54:58.680 --> 1:55:05.400
 Um, so we were, we came to agreement on two 100 person phase three studies.

1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:09.880
 And the idea is that it's very possible that the, the first part, the first study would

1:55:09.880 --> 1:55:13.000
 show the efficacy because the effect is so strong.

1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:14.000
 Yeah.

1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:15.000
 Yeah.

1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:16.520
 And the second, but, but also safety as well.

1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:21.320
 So, so, you know, one of the things we also realized when you work with a highly stigmatized

1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:28.520
 drug in the midst of still, you know, the drug war and prohibition that we need to highly

1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:35.040
 sympathetic subjects and we need to make the best case we can, which means we need to work

1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:38.520
 with the hardest cases so that this is really needed.

1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:40.960
 And so we end up enrolling people.

1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:45.160
 The first study was chronic severe PTSD.

1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:51.200
 And unlike many studies of PTSD, we enroll people that have previously attempted suicide.

1:55:51.200 --> 1:55:56.640
 So we have multiple people that have tried to kill themselves that we felt like, um,

1:55:56.640 --> 1:55:58.560
 if we were to exclude them, what are we doing that?

1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:00.640
 Those are the people that need it the most.

1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:09.360
 So we came to this agreement with FDA, we're going to work with chronic severe PTSD patients,

1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:11.920
 including those that attempted suicide.

1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:15.080
 And we would do these two 100 person studies.

1:56:15.080 --> 1:56:19.880
 And we also negotiated what's called an interim analysis.

1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:28.800
 So what that means is that when the study is underway and often big, big studies, they

1:56:28.800 --> 1:56:33.080
 have this kind of interim analysis where what you do is, and for us, we negotiate when we

1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:40.080
 had 60% or 60 people had reached the primary outcome measure and all hundred had been enrolled.

1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:42.280
 Then we would take a look at the data.

1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:51.480
 And if the statistical analysis that we did was, um, showing, you know, based on a certain

1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:56.240
 effect size that we chose based on what we saw in phase two, the interim analysis is

1:56:56.240 --> 1:56:59.320
 for what's called sample size re estimation.

1:56:59.320 --> 1:57:02.320
 So what it means is if the results aren't as good as you thought they would, you can

1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:07.840
 add more people and then you'll get statistical significance.

1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:11.560
 It means that your effect isn't as strong as you thought it'll be harder to get insurance

1:57:11.560 --> 1:57:17.520
 to cover it, but FDA will still approve it because FDA also believes that these are group

1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:18.880
 averages.

1:57:18.880 --> 1:57:22.560
 There may be some people that will later figure out, respond better than others.

1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:27.280
 So they'll approve it if it's statistically significant, even if it has a low effect size.

1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:30.240
 The SSRIs have low effect size.

1:57:30.240 --> 1:57:36.080
 So we did the, um, interim analysis in March of 2020.

1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:41.940
 And what we discovered to our delight was that, um, we did not need to add any subjects.

1:57:41.940 --> 1:57:43.100
 That's all we were told.

1:57:43.100 --> 1:57:45.880
 We weren't told like, what is the results?

1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:49.960
 We were just told all we were going to get is a number zero or you need to add X numbers

1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:53.400
 of people to the study to get statistical significance.

1:57:53.400 --> 1:57:58.520
 That's right around the time that COVID hit and lockdowns happened and we ended up negotiating

1:57:58.520 --> 1:58:04.920
 with FDA that we would end the study with 90 people instead of a hundred.

1:58:04.920 --> 1:58:06.760
 It took a while for us to end up doing that.

1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:10.880
 So the paper that we just published is on the results of 90 people.

1:58:10.880 --> 1:58:17.180
 I think it was 46 in the MDMA group, 44 in the placebo group.

1:58:17.180 --> 1:58:23.360
 And what we discovered was that the study worked better than we had even hoped.

1:58:23.360 --> 1:58:29.280
 So the first thing is that you look at statistical significance, you have to get.05, which basically

1:58:29.280 --> 1:58:33.640
 means a nickel out of a dollar, one in 20 chance that the difference between the two

1:58:33.640 --> 1:58:38.280
 groups is due to some random factor rather than to your intervention.

1:58:38.280 --> 1:58:44.840
 And in this case, the, the placebo group gets therapy and then with inactive placebo and

1:58:44.840 --> 1:58:49.240
 then the group gets MDMA with active placebo.

1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:52.320
 So you have to get.05.

1:58:52.320 --> 1:58:58.360
 There's another measure that the FDA uses sometimes called robust, which means one in

1:58:58.360 --> 1:59:01.640
 a thousand instead of one in 20, one in a thousand.

1:59:01.640 --> 1:59:10.200
 And if you get a robust results,.001 and you meet some other criteria, they might agree

1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:15.320
 to approve the drug on the basis of just one phase three study instead of two.

1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:19.760
 Because when you think about it, a one in 20 chance for your first second phase three

1:59:19.760 --> 1:59:24.160
 study, a one in 20 chance for your second phase three study, you multiply that together,

1:59:24.160 --> 1:59:31.120
 it's one in 400,.025.

1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:32.760
 That's pretty good.

1:59:32.760 --> 1:59:41.400
 So robust,.001 is even better than two independent phase three studies each at.05.

1:59:41.400 --> 1:59:45.840
 What we ended up getting was one in 10,000,.001.

1:59:45.840 --> 1:59:46.840
 Outrageous.

1:59:46.840 --> 1:59:47.840
 Yeah.

1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:49.680
 You know, incredibly.

1:59:49.680 --> 1:59:54.760
 So that's a measure of both the difference between the two groups and the variability.

1:59:54.760 --> 2:00:00.440
 And so what it meant is that we had minimal variability that most people who got to MDMA

2:00:00.440 --> 2:00:03.640
 got quite a large amount of benefit from it.

2:00:03.640 --> 2:00:07.080
 And most people who got to placebo were more or less in the same range as well.

2:00:07.080 --> 2:00:09.280
 That's really exciting, by the way.

2:00:09.280 --> 2:00:16.600
 I mean, I suppose it's exciting from a perspective of approval by the FDA.

2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:22.480
 Maybe perhaps that's the way you're seeing it, but it's also exciting because it has

2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:25.080
 a chance to help people that are truly suffering.

2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:26.080
 Yeah.

2:00:26.080 --> 2:00:32.240
 Well, if we can get one in 10,000 in the first phase three study, chances are we can get

2:00:32.240 --> 2:00:34.520
 one in 20 in the second.

2:00:34.520 --> 2:00:39.840
 So it's really going to be about safety for us in the second phase three study.

2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:47.560
 Now you can have a large p value, a large significance, but you could have an effect

2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:49.760
 that's not very significant.

2:00:49.760 --> 2:00:51.160
 It's not clinically significant.

2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:55.720
 You can have statistical significance without clinical significance.

2:00:55.720 --> 2:00:59.320
 And as I said, the more people you get in the study, you can find smaller and smaller

2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:02.080
 differences between two groups.

2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:07.400
 Now we showed that we had a very large effect size.

2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:10.400
 So effect size is based on...

2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:11.560
 That scale you mentioned?

2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:17.360
 Well, the scale of the effect size is based on standard deviations.

2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:22.200
 So an effect size of one means that your results are one standard deviation away from

2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:23.480
 the norm.

2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:26.400
 That's considered very large.

2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:33.680
 The SSRIs, because they were like 0.3, 0.4 effect size, that's considered small effect

2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:34.680
 size.

2:01:34.680 --> 2:01:41.560
 Medium is starting to be around 0.6 and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes.

2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:45.720
 We had what's called placebo subtracted effect size.

2:01:45.720 --> 2:01:47.200
 There's two different ways to look at it.

2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:52.080
 Placebo subtracted means you kind of look at the difference between your two groups.

2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:56.320
 And what that is for us, since one group had therapy and one had therapy plus MDMA, the

2:01:56.320 --> 2:02:02.280
 placebo subtracted effect size is basically the effect of just the MDMA, because you've

2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:03.680
 kind of washed out the therapy.

2:02:03.680 --> 2:02:05.360
 That was 0.91.

2:02:05.360 --> 2:02:08.680
 So we had a large effect size, which is different.

2:02:08.680 --> 2:02:09.680
 Wow.

2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:13.280
 Over, so 0.91 over just the therapy, so over the placebo.

2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:14.280
 Yeah.

2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:15.280
 Wow.

2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:21.760
 Now, when we do the within group, meaning the group that just got the MDMA plus therapy,

2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:25.440
 look at their baseline and their outcomes, that's another way to look at it.

2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:28.360
 And that's what's going to actually happen in practice, because people are going to get

2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:31.120
 MDMA plus therapy.

2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:38.320
 That's 2.1 effect size, two standard deviations away from the norm is enormous effect size.

2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:45.000
 The other part is that we had no effect by site, which is very important.

2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:50.920
 So we had 15 sites, two in Israel, two in Canada, 11 throughout the United States.

2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:53.480
 The FDA looks at, is there a site effect?

2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:57.160
 Because what that might mean is, maybe you've got all your patients, or most of your patients

2:02:57.160 --> 2:03:02.240
 going to this one site, which is these highly experienced therapists, and they're hippies

2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:06.920
 from way back, and they're super experienced with psychedelics, and they're getting great

2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:09.320
 results, but nobody else gets good results.

2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:15.000
 So we had no effect by site, which means that we've been able to train all these new therapists.

2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:20.440
 We had about 80 therapists working at all these 15 sites.

2:03:20.440 --> 2:03:27.080
 We also discovered that there's a group that's considered to be very difficult to treat, which

2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:30.040
 is called the dissociative subtype.

2:03:30.040 --> 2:03:38.200
 So when people are traumatized, one of the ways to psychologically survive that is you

2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:39.200
 dissociate.

2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:41.200
 It's like you're not there.

2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:45.440
 When you do that, though, it's hard to come back, because when you come back, then you

2:03:45.440 --> 2:03:47.600
 get all these painful memories and fearful.

2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:54.200
 And so the extreme of that is called dissociative identity disorder, kind of like schizophrenia,

2:03:54.200 --> 2:03:56.560
 almost dissociative identity.

2:03:56.560 --> 2:04:02.240
 So we let people in who are on the dissociative subtype, and those are considered to be the

2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:08.160
 hardest to treat, because the theory is that you need to be eco intact, as I said, the

2:04:08.160 --> 2:04:12.280
 mystical experience is not correlated with therapeutic outcomes, and you need to be talking

2:04:12.280 --> 2:04:16.800
 about what traumatized you and working through that and expressing it, letting it out, not

2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:18.200
 just keeping it in.

2:04:18.200 --> 2:04:24.440
 So the dissociative subtype seems like it's harder for them to get back into the event

2:04:24.440 --> 2:04:26.440
 because they're so dissociated.

2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:31.560
 What we showed is that those people did even better on average than everybody else.

2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:33.280
 So that MDMA is integrative.

2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:39.160
 It helps people who are so separate that they make even more rapid progress.

2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:43.440
 So it's almost like the MDMA made it more difficult for them to dissociate?

2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:44.440
 Yes.

2:04:44.440 --> 2:04:47.040
 Or you could say it made it easier for them to remember.

2:04:47.040 --> 2:04:48.040
 Yes.

2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:49.040
 Exactly.

2:04:49.040 --> 2:04:50.040
 To reverse the dissociation.

2:04:50.040 --> 2:04:51.040
 Yeah.

2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:54.720
 And we find that MDMA enhances memory for the trauma.

2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:59.720
 So that you can have these unconscious memories or memories that you cannot remember or that

2:04:59.720 --> 2:05:02.760
 you've suppressed so much, but they distort your view.

2:05:02.760 --> 2:05:07.640
 Your filter of the world is distorted by these fearful memories that the world can't be trusted.

2:05:07.640 --> 2:05:08.640
 People can't be trusted.

2:05:08.640 --> 2:05:10.160
 It's always about to happen.

2:05:10.160 --> 2:05:15.440
 So we find that MDMA increases memory for the trauma, but by reducing the fear, then

2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:17.000
 the memories can come to the surface.

2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:21.640
 Then you can process them, let out the emotions, cry, scream, shake, whatever.

2:05:21.640 --> 2:05:27.760
 And then through this MDMA effect on the amygdala and the hippocampus, it helps you store these

2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:31.440
 memories into long term storage so that they're not always about to happen.

2:05:31.440 --> 2:05:32.720
 They're in the past.

2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:35.440
 They're part of your story, but they're not the whole story.

2:05:35.440 --> 2:05:38.720
 So we discovered that the dissociative subtype works better.

2:05:38.720 --> 2:05:42.920
 Now none of this would be enough unless safety.

2:05:42.920 --> 2:05:48.160
 So from a safety perspective, what we discovered is that there was one woman in the study that

2:05:48.160 --> 2:05:52.160
 attempted to kill herself twice during the study.

2:05:52.160 --> 2:05:59.000
 There was another woman that was so worried that she might kill herself, that the therapy

2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:02.960
 brought these things to the surface that she's been pushing away, that she checked herself

2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:06.840
 into a hospital in order to avoid self harm.

2:06:06.840 --> 2:06:11.880
 At the end of the study, what we learned is both of them were in the placebo group.

2:06:11.880 --> 2:06:17.080
 We didn't have anybody in the MDMA group attempt to kill themselves.

2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:25.800
 So the MDMA is really helpful for giving people a sense of hope and that they can somehow

2:06:25.800 --> 2:06:27.080
 process this.

2:06:27.080 --> 2:06:31.720
 Now, it's not to say that nobody will ever commit suicide, and that's our big concern

2:06:31.720 --> 2:06:34.280
 in the second phase three study.

2:06:34.280 --> 2:06:37.000
 As I said, it's more going to be about safety than about efficacy.

2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:42.560
 We think we'll get the efficacy, but we're very concerned about safety.

2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:47.280
 Because we had problems in the first phase three study of somebody trying to kill herself

2:06:47.280 --> 2:06:53.000
 twice in the placebo group, it's the background for having PTSD.

2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:57.320
 So there'd have to be a disproportionate number of people in the MDMA group try to kill themselves

2:06:57.320 --> 2:07:01.840
 or succeed in killing themselves then in the placebo group for the FDA to say, oh, this

2:07:01.840 --> 2:07:04.560
 MDMA, it's too dangerous.

2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:06.000
 We don't think that's going to happen.

2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:13.280
 So the other findings are that from safety is that the side effects are transitory.

2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:14.280
 They're minor.

2:07:14.280 --> 2:07:20.840
 They're sweating or jaw clenching, or slight temperature increase, and everybody that's

2:07:20.840 --> 2:07:24.120
 been to a rave knows about taking ecstasy.

2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:27.880
 There are some side effects, but they're minor, they're transitory.

2:07:27.880 --> 2:07:34.240
 And there has been this massive problem of, during the 80s, the 90s, NIDA, the National

2:07:34.240 --> 2:07:37.880
 Medicine and Drug Abuse, was trying to say that MDMA was neurotoxic.

2:07:37.880 --> 2:07:41.320
 And that you take it and it's going to cause nerve terminal degeneration.

2:07:41.320 --> 2:07:43.040
 It's going to be major brain damage.

2:07:43.040 --> 2:07:45.520
 It's going to be significant functional consequences.

2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:50.200
 And back then they were saying that MDMA is too dangerous, it should never even be researched.

2:07:50.200 --> 2:07:54.280
 Nobody should even get it once because it's poison and brain damage.

2:07:54.280 --> 2:07:56.600
 Well, we no longer believe that.

2:07:56.600 --> 2:07:57.600
 That was exaggerated.

2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:00.880
 That was in service of the drug war.

2:08:00.880 --> 2:08:06.800
 But we've done in phase two neurocognitive tests before and after in two of our different

2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:09.920
 sites and showed no decline in cognitive functioning.

2:08:09.920 --> 2:08:16.840
 So we don't think that there's any neurotoxicity happening and the doses that we use, there's

2:08:16.840 --> 2:08:20.560
 no obvious functional consequences, people are getting better.

2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:25.480
 The other thing that we've learned in phase two and that we still have to learn from this

2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:26.480
 study.

2:08:26.480 --> 2:08:29.440
 And that is that is the durability of the effect.

2:08:29.440 --> 2:08:35.320
 We showed that 32% of the people that got the therapy without MDMA at two months after

2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:41.000
 the last experimental session no longer had PTSD, just with the therapy, which is phenomenal

2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:48.320
 because these are on average 14 years PTSD, one third had PTSD over 20 years.

2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:54.200
 And just with the therapy, 32% no longer had PTSD at the two months.

2:08:54.200 --> 2:09:02.400
 However, those people that got MDMA was 67% no longer had PTSD, more than twice as good.

2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:07.800
 In phase two and in phase three, we're also going to do the 12 month follow up.

2:09:07.800 --> 2:09:09.440
 That's not for the FDA.

2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:10.880
 That's not for approvability.

2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:15.400
 That's more for insurance companies because this is expensive, a lot of therapy time.

2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:20.200
 If it fades, if it's great results initially, but then it fades after six months, what's

2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:22.280
 the point?

2:09:22.280 --> 2:09:29.080
 And what we showed in phase two is that people keep getting better.

2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:33.640
 At the two month follow up, they're doing pretty well, but at the 12 month follow up,

2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:35.080
 they're even better.

2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:39.240
 So it's durable, people have learned how to process trauma, they keep getting better.

2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:42.720
 So we've not reached that point in this phase three study where everybody's got their one

2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:43.720
 year follow up.

2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:47.400
 But we have also done three and a half year follow ups to some of the groups that were

2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:52.800
 in phase two and showed that it was durable and we're doing a long, long term follow up

2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:57.760
 now to everybody, to many of the people in phase two, some of them treated 15 years ago.

2:09:57.760 --> 2:10:00.120
 So that's all more for the insurance companies.

2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:05.440
 So basically what we found in the paper that we just published is that it was highly efficacious,

2:10:05.440 --> 2:10:11.600
 highly significant, no effect by sight, works in the hardest cases and the safety record

2:10:11.600 --> 2:10:12.600
 was great.

2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:18.640
 That's an incredible success and that's really exciting, especially given that the people

2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:24.520
 who've committed, who attempted to commit suicide were led into the study and so these

2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:30.120
 are, these are people who are truly suffering.

2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:38.320
 I mean, that, that's incredibly exciting and I mean, just to speak to the frustration

2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:45.720
 why things can't move faster, but, but for what it is, it's incredibly exciting.

2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:51.480
 Is there other studies of this nature that you foresee enabling that same kind of positive

2:10:51.480 --> 2:10:57.040
 impact, whether it's MDMA for other things like treating addiction or maybe it's psilocybin

2:10:57.040 --> 2:10:59.480
 for, for other conditions?

2:10:59.480 --> 2:11:01.160
 Is there something else that's promising?

2:11:01.160 --> 2:11:02.160
 Yeah.

2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:09.040
 I think that what we've discovered, I don't think is unique to MDMA.

2:11:09.040 --> 2:11:15.040
 So it's MDMA assisted psychotherapy, MDMA is ideal for PTSD.

2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:19.200
 You know, it maybe it won't work as well for OCD or other things, you know, it was very

2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:23.880
 strategic why we chose MDMA and why we chose PTSD.

2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:29.160
 But I don't think that the results that we've got are so unique to MDMA assisted therapy.

2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:34.640
 I think that psilocybin assisted therapy is going to be great for people with life threatening

2:11:34.640 --> 2:11:38.040
 illnesses, cancer, you know, we're anxious about dying.

2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:41.000
 It's looks like it's really good in the treatment of addiction.

2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:48.280
 Again, these are in combination with sort of the psilocybin tobacco was cognitive behavioral

2:11:48.280 --> 2:11:51.440
 therapy with psilocybin.

2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:55.600
 I think that it's going to be a little bit more difficult psilocybin for depression.

2:11:55.600 --> 2:11:58.040
 I don't know if it'll be quite as good.

2:11:58.040 --> 2:12:02.000
 You know, there are some biological aspects sometimes to depression.

2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.840
 But I think that they'll be really good results for psilocybin for depression.

2:12:04.840 --> 2:12:06.040
 I think it'll be approved.

2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:09.040
 It's considered a breakthrough therapy by the FDA.

2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:14.680
 Ibogaine is phenomenal for opiate addiction, helping people go through withdrawal and then

2:12:14.680 --> 2:12:21.280
 giving them this chance to deal with the material that they've that drives them for addiction.

2:12:21.280 --> 2:12:26.600
 There was Ben Sessa, Dr. Ben Sessa in England did MDMA for alcohol use disorder.

2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:27.840
 And that was really great.

2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:28.840
 The results he got.

2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:33.600
 And it's, it's the case that he ended up basically treating people for trauma.

2:12:33.600 --> 2:12:39.680
 It's the trauma that people run the emotional challenges that people run from into quieting

2:12:39.680 --> 2:12:43.080
 that pain through drug addiction or alcoholism.

2:12:43.080 --> 2:12:44.920
 So trauma is behind a lot of addiction.

2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:52.120
 I think that we are going to see a revolution in psychiatry and that there will be a lot

2:12:52.120 --> 2:13:00.440
 of conditions that have left a lot of people still suffering that psychedelic assisted

2:13:00.440 --> 2:13:03.120
 therapy, different psychedelics, different approaches.

2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:08.240
 But I think that we will see a lot of hope for psychiatry and psychotherapy and that

2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:13.480
 psychedelics would be a big part of changing the practice of psychiatry and psychotherapy.

2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:14.480
 Yeah.

2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:15.840
 This is really, to me, fascinating.

2:13:15.840 --> 2:13:21.360
 So I actually, when I was younger for the longest time, I wanted to be a psychiatrist.

2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:27.760
 So I was excited by psychotherapy, but then I perhaps incorrectly, maybe you can correct

2:13:27.760 --> 2:13:32.960
 me, but became more and more cynical because it felt like it was more about prescribing

2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:34.520
 drugs than psychotherapy.

2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:35.520
 I'm not going to correct you.

2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:40.160
 That's, I mean, right now, it's like there is a crisis in psychiatry that there are

2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:45.760
 so many psychiatrists that are so fed up because they have been pharmaceuticalized.

2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:47.400
 They meet people for 15 minutes.

2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:49.280
 They adjust their medications.

2:13:49.280 --> 2:13:51.000
 This is the way they make the most money.

2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:52.000
 Yeah.

2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000
 But they've lost the art of talking to people.

2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:55.000
 Yes.

2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:56.000
 It's true.

2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:02.840
 And that's why we see that so many young psychiatric residents are so thrilled by psychedelics

2:14:02.840 --> 2:14:07.120
 that they really want to get back to treating people as individuals, not just the bunch

2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:08.120
 of chemicals.

2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:09.120
 Yeah.

2:14:09.120 --> 2:14:10.120
 That's truly fascinating.

2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:15.880
 Because the reason it was appealing to me, it was a way to study the human mind and to

2:14:15.880 --> 2:14:26.360
 see ways through talking that you can make people feel better, make people better, make

2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:28.400
 people suffer less.

2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:30.880
 And that was really exciting at the time.

2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:35.840
 I ended up then going to AI because then I can understand the mind from that angle.

2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:44.000
 But it's exciting that that could be also, revolutionized the field of psychotherapy.

2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:50.960
 Take it from its back to its origins to where a psychiatrist would be a scholar of the mind.

2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:51.960
 Yeah.

2:14:51.960 --> 2:14:56.560
 Well, Freud talked about dreams as the royal road to the unconscious.

2:14:56.560 --> 2:15:01.040
 And there was a lot of, you really spent a lot of time with people.

2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:07.760
 Now, right before he died in his last book, Freud wrote something, and again, this will

2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:14.640
 be a rough paraphrase, but he said that in the future, we may learn about the energies

2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:20.360
 of the brain, and there'll be ways with chemicals to influence that that will help the therapeutic

2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:21.360
 process.

2:15:21.360 --> 2:15:22.360
 Yeah.

2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:27.840
 So you could say he was ahead of his time.

2:15:27.840 --> 2:15:28.840
 Yeah.

2:15:28.840 --> 2:15:35.840
 This study paints a fascinating picture of a future where first for medical applications,

2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:42.680
 but then also in general psychedelics of various forms could be used by the broader society.

2:15:42.680 --> 2:15:50.160
 Forgive the perhaps ridiculous question, but if much of society, including our politicians,

2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:59.120
 are taking psychedelics and dissolving their ego and going through this whole process,

2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:04.560
 how do you think the world may look different in 20, 30, 50 years?

2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:13.000
 Okay, so I said that I think licensed legalization happens in 2035.

2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:22.200
 And I think by 2050, we will have enough people, hopefully, spiritualized.

2:16:22.200 --> 2:16:29.080
 We're also talking about, we hear so much in terms of climate change about net zero

2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:30.080
 carbon.

2:16:30.080 --> 2:16:33.160
 So our goal is net zero trauma.

2:16:33.160 --> 2:16:36.440
 When do we have a world with net zero trauma?

2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:39.680
 Right now, we have two sites in Israel.

2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:45.600
 So we help a few people, but the recent war with Gaza has traumatized millions of people

2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:46.960
 on both sides.

2:16:46.960 --> 2:16:52.200
 So we are a long way away from net zero trauma.

2:16:52.200 --> 2:16:56.320
 But that's the hope, and that's, I think, possible.

2:16:56.320 --> 2:17:05.920
 I think humanity as a whole is like lemmings heading over a cliff with climate change and

2:17:05.920 --> 2:17:12.760
 with the nuclear proliferation and just the religious hatreds and the more the retreat

2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:17.720
 to authoritarianism and fundamentalism and tribalism.

2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:22.760
 So I think that there's a very good chance, though, that psychedelics used wisely.

2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:26.720
 So it's not just makes psychedelics legal and everybody takes them, and as you talked

2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:31.360
 about Ted Kaczynski, it's the context that people take it in.

2:17:31.360 --> 2:17:38.840
 But I think that there's a reasonable chance that enough people can sort of, you could

2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:48.840
 say, clean their filters to see people as more similar to them than different, not to

2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:50.520
 label them as the enemy.

2:17:50.520 --> 2:17:59.200
 Stan Grof, again, had this beautiful phrase about transparent to the transcendent.

2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:02.640
 So for our ego, can we be transparent to the transcendent?

2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:08.600
 Because can the filter that we look through the world at be cleaned to, you could say,

2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:10.600
 cleansing the doors of perception?

2:18:10.600 --> 2:18:17.880
 Can it be cleaned to the point where we can see the humanity and everybody and see that

2:18:17.880 --> 2:18:21.800
 one way to say this is that can we get to the point where religions are seen as like

2:18:21.800 --> 2:18:28.520
 languages where we all have this need to communicate, there's thousands of different languages.

2:18:28.520 --> 2:18:32.280
 We don't say that this language is fundamentally better than this language.

2:18:32.280 --> 2:18:33.920
 This language is the only right language.

2:18:33.920 --> 2:18:38.520
 Everybody must speak English and Russian is bad or German is bad.

2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:42.080
 Maybe we'll get to that point that religions are like that, that they're different cultural

2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:47.200
 backgrounds, different symbol systems, different saints and heroes and messiahs and all this.

2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:52.480
 But that, you know, yeah, Jesus is the Son of God, but so is everybody.

2:18:52.480 --> 2:18:56.000
 Or you know, the Jews are the chosen people, but so is everybody.

2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:57.560
 So can we get there?

2:18:57.560 --> 2:19:04.120
 I think that we can and I think that we need to to survive the challenges that we're facing.

2:19:04.120 --> 2:19:12.320
 And the hope is that by bringing psychedelics as tools forward and trying to bring the context

2:19:12.320 --> 2:19:19.560
 around them to be one of responsibility rather than just profit maximization and just get

2:19:19.560 --> 2:19:25.320
 as many people to do them from all these for profit companies, you know, can we, and then

2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:29.400
 also drug policy reform and embed knowledge in the society, can we get to honest drug

2:19:29.400 --> 2:19:37.680
 education, you know, dare the drug awareness resistance education, you know, is fundamentally

2:19:37.680 --> 2:19:38.680
 twisted.

2:19:38.680 --> 2:19:42.880
 I mean, but it's the program that's using a lot of schools now.

2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:47.920
 So can we get honest drug education, pure drugs, harm reduction and knowledge about

2:19:47.920 --> 2:19:55.280
 therapeutic uses and on the one hand, and more of these thousands of psychedelic clinics.

2:19:55.280 --> 2:19:59.280
 I'm hopeful and that that's our goal.

2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:06.080
 But in this landscape of pharma companies, they make a lot of money.

2:20:06.080 --> 2:20:11.640
 Some people are worried about the impact of those, you know, of big pharma on the landscape

2:20:11.640 --> 2:20:12.840
 of human trauma.

2:20:12.840 --> 2:20:13.840
 Yeah.

2:20:13.840 --> 2:20:14.840
 Yeah.

2:20:14.840 --> 2:20:20.240
 So there's, of course, some companies could do good, but that's not inherent.

2:20:20.240 --> 2:20:26.680
 Like many of these companies are not optimizing for good, they're optimizing for profit.

2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:27.680
 Exactly.

2:20:27.680 --> 2:20:28.680
 Exactly.

2:20:28.680 --> 2:20:32.000
 Does this rise of for profit pharma companies worry you?

2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:33.760
 How do you navigate it?

2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:40.600
 Do we still have for profit companies that basically do what MAPS does, which is like

2:20:40.600 --> 2:20:42.920
 fight the good fight for the benefit of humanity?

2:20:42.920 --> 2:20:48.560
 Like what, like how do we proceed in this, in landscape work where drugs can make a lot

2:20:48.560 --> 2:20:49.560
 of money?

2:20:49.560 --> 2:20:55.960
 Well, I am concerned overall, I think the rise of the for profit companies, we have

2:20:55.960 --> 2:21:04.640
 to realize is a sign of success, that we have overcome the regulatory prohibitions, we've

2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:09.880
 overcome a lot of the public attitudes that are against it, we've demonstrated some success.

2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:14.080
 So the rise of the for profit companies are a sign of the progress that we've made.

2:21:14.080 --> 2:21:19.880
 On the other hand, turning things over to profit maximizing companies, the big concern

2:21:19.880 --> 2:21:26.120
 is that they're going to try to minimize the amount of therapy and make it so the cost

2:21:26.120 --> 2:21:30.080
 is less so insurance companies are more likely to cover it and then that they just sell the

2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:32.200
 most drugs.

2:21:32.200 --> 2:21:36.960
 The other thing we've seen as an example of this is S ketamine by Johnson & Johnson

2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:40.760
 for depression and it's done by a profit maximizing company.

2:21:40.760 --> 2:21:45.000
 They don't know anything about psychedelic psychotherapy or psychotherapy at all.

2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:50.520
 And so they've gotten approval for S ketamine on the basis of it's just a pharmacological

2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:55.040
 treatment and it's not delivered with therapy.

2:21:55.040 --> 2:21:59.920
 The results fade pretty quickly so you need to get more ketamine.

2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:04.840
 And so it's designed in a way to maximize the profits for the pharmaceutical company

2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:07.920
 but it doesn't maximize patient outcomes.

2:22:07.920 --> 2:22:12.000
 What we're seeing though in these various clinics that are being set up is that a lot

2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:17.740
 of people are realizing that it works better with therapy.

2:22:17.740 --> 2:22:22.840
 And so the clinics are run by people that are therapists so that when they provide therapy

2:22:22.840 --> 2:22:26.800
 they're making more money and then you need less ketamine.

2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:33.400
 Also ketamine itself, S ketamine is a isomer of ketamine that's been patented for depression

2:22:33.400 --> 2:22:38.640
 and they sell it for hundreds of dollars but ketamine itself is one of the world's essential

2:22:38.640 --> 2:22:39.640
 medicines.

2:22:39.640 --> 2:22:42.640
 It's been a rough patent, it's been around for a long time, it was the main battlefield

2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:47.480
 anesthetic in Vietnam and it's only a few bucks because it's generic.

2:22:47.480 --> 2:22:51.960
 So a lot of the ketamine clinics are saying, great, thank you Johnson and Johnson, you've

2:22:51.960 --> 2:22:55.680
 helped demonstrate that ketamine is good for depression but we're not going to buy it from

2:22:55.680 --> 2:22:56.680
 you.

2:22:56.680 --> 2:23:00.760
 We're going to buy it for a few bucks and we're going to add therapy to it.

2:23:00.760 --> 2:23:05.120
 Now there's a bunch of ketamine mills you could say that are just prescribing the ketamine

2:23:05.120 --> 2:23:07.260
 and people are making a lot of money there.

2:23:07.260 --> 2:23:09.400
 So I am worried about that.

2:23:09.400 --> 2:23:16.280
 I think the best thing that we can do is create an alternative narrative, a different kind

2:23:16.280 --> 2:23:17.280
 of example.

2:23:17.280 --> 2:23:18.280
 We can lead by example.

2:23:18.280 --> 2:23:23.680
 We can't make for profit companies into benefit corporations unless they want to do that.

2:23:23.680 --> 2:23:28.640
 We can't make them to really maximize patient outcomes.

2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:35.400
 But if we create an example of something that's different, the hope is that people gravitate

2:23:35.400 --> 2:23:41.400
 towards that and some of the other companies, like even now we have Exxon and other oil

2:23:41.400 --> 2:23:46.000
 companies saying, oh, we're big into alternative energy and we're...

2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:51.000
 And that starts with companies that show an example that then communicates to the public

2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:56.320
 that this is something exciting and then they demand the same of Exxon and so on.

2:23:56.320 --> 2:24:02.120
 The public demands it and you could say the same thing for the public demanding the big

2:24:02.120 --> 2:24:11.280
 pharma to optimize for benefit versus optimize for profit and maybe giving power to the therapists,

2:24:11.280 --> 2:24:16.400
 more power to the therapists, more power to the doctors that ultimately want...

2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:25.440
 I think incentives are interesting, but I think doctors ultimately care more because

2:24:25.440 --> 2:24:27.460
 they're in direct contact with humans.

2:24:27.460 --> 2:24:29.160
 They want to make people better.

2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:33.760
 It's not sure they want to make money, but they ultimately want to make people feel better

2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:38.600
 because they get to look at people and it's so joyful to make people feel better at the

2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:39.600
 end of the day.

2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:47.880
 So giving more power to them is also perhaps one of the ways that you then incentivize

2:24:47.880 --> 2:24:53.000
 the pharma companies that are trying to do good because the doctors will choose those

2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:54.000
 companies.

2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:55.000
 Yeah.

2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.400
 Now, the other part of this is drug policy reform.

2:24:57.400 --> 2:25:04.000
 So that if we make it so that you can buy MDMA for 10 or 20 bucks on your own and we've

2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:10.600
 trained people on, here's our therapeutic method, here is our ways for peer support,

2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:15.160
 then people have an alternative from buying it from the pharma companies.

2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:23.160
 So most of the for profit companies have come to this conclusion that drug policy reform

2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:25.600
 is bad for their business model.

2:25:25.600 --> 2:25:31.040
 I think they're making a fundamental mistake and I think the reason is that the more that

2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:36.040
 we destigmatize this, the more that we sensitize people to this is an approach.

2:25:36.040 --> 2:25:40.880
 Even when people can get it on their own and do it with their friends or do it with themselves,

2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:44.840
 there's going to be even more people that say, oh my God, I've got real serious issues.

2:25:44.840 --> 2:25:51.200
 I would rather go to trained professionals covered by insurance and I think it'll increase

2:25:51.200 --> 2:25:52.920
 the business.

2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:56.400
 But most of the for profit companies don't see it that way.

2:25:56.400 --> 2:26:02.320
 And so as a non profit that owns a benefit corp, we're not trying to maximize sales

2:26:02.320 --> 2:26:09.640
 or profits, but I do believe that drug policy reform creates this alternative access point

2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:15.840
 for people and that will help keep the for profits in check to some extent as well.

2:26:15.840 --> 2:26:17.520
 I love it.

2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:26.080
 Is there, let's put on your wise visionary hat and ask, when you look to young folks,

2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:31.880
 is there advice you can give the young people today, whether in high score college, about

2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:34.800
 career, about life?

2:26:34.800 --> 2:26:39.120
 You've lived quite a nonlinear and fascinating life yourself.

2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:44.000
 Is there advice you can give either on career or more generally on life?

2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:52.600
 Well, I would say what people often hear is that, you know, we're not actually here for

2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:56.440
 that long a period of time.

2:26:56.440 --> 2:27:03.200
 And so to the, and the world is on fire and whether humanity survives is not clear and

2:27:03.200 --> 2:27:08.560
 whether how many species are we going to kill before we figure out not to do that.

2:27:08.560 --> 2:27:18.120
 So I would advise you to really try to develop a combination of what do you need in terms

2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:26.160
 of income for your own survival, but what does the world need in terms of help to make

2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:27.880
 the world better?

2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:33.040
 And you know, Howard Thurman, who he talked about who ran the Good Friday experiment,

2:27:33.040 --> 2:27:36.320
 the minister there, he said, he's got a famous quote attributed to him.

2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:40.160
 He says, and this is exactly it to young people.

2:27:40.160 --> 2:27:45.360
 He said, you know, there's nothing particular that you should do, but find what makes you

2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:52.480
 come alive because what the world needs is people that have come alive and are passionate.

2:27:52.480 --> 2:28:04.240
 So I would say that be aware of this trap that you need vast resources that you need

2:28:04.240 --> 2:28:11.120
 all this stuff, you know, I keep thinking of the super wealthy people in first class

2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:16.200
 on the Titanic, you know, as the Titanic is sinking, you know, their money is not going

2:28:16.200 --> 2:28:17.200
 to help them.

2:28:17.200 --> 2:28:21.600
 The earth is like Titanic, you know, we're sinking, we're destroying the planet, destroying

2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:22.600
 the environment.

2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:29.600
 So you need a certain amount of money to be comfortable, to not be at that edge of survival.

2:28:29.600 --> 2:28:32.760
 Because once you're at that edge of survival, it's hard to think about anything else.

2:28:32.760 --> 2:28:40.080
 And I'd say to young people, to the extent that you're able to do this, and again, student

2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:47.760
 debt and all this kind of stuff is a big problem there too, but really just try to find this

2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:50.480
 combination of what the world needs and what you need.

2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:56.920
 The other thing to say to young people is life is a lot shorter than you think.

2:28:56.920 --> 2:29:00.520
 That and a 20 year plan is not really that long.

2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:06.760
 So if it takes you 20 years to get into position to do what you want to do, go for it, you

2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:09.040
 know, have long term plans.

2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:15.560
 The other part that was so important for me to keep doing what I've been doing, basically,

2:29:15.560 --> 2:29:21.800
 now it's 49 years that I've sort of been devoting my life on psychedelics since I was 18.

2:29:21.800 --> 2:29:23.600
 When I started, I didn't think it would ever work.

2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:28.000
 I just thought this is the only idea I have in this crazy world, you know, this is what

2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:33.200
 I want to work on, luckily I had support from my family that took care of my survival needs.

2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:34.880
 So I could do that.

2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:41.720
 But I realized that if my happiness was dependent upon accomplishments, that I might never be

2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:50.240
 happy, that I was able to reframe happiness in terms of effort, you know, so if I'm trying

2:29:50.240 --> 2:29:56.840
 hard to get stuff to be better, whether it's better or not, I can be happy at the end of

2:29:56.840 --> 2:29:58.760
 each day, I tried.

2:29:58.760 --> 2:30:03.960
 And so I think you try to separate out the goals that you have and your happiness to

2:30:03.960 --> 2:30:07.040
 whether you're trying hard.

2:30:07.040 --> 2:30:13.080
 The other thing I would say is that everybody has this humanity within them.

2:30:13.080 --> 2:30:19.480
 So be very careful about dividing the world into us and them.

2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:27.600
 You know, and try to, so one of the things that I've done that has taken a long time

2:30:27.600 --> 2:30:31.000
 because, you know, I feel like, you know, drugs are illegal.

2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:35.120
 I always felt like, you know, the police were the predator and I'm the prey.

2:30:35.120 --> 2:30:36.120
 Yes.

2:30:36.120 --> 2:30:40.160
 You know, but now we're working with the police and the police have tremendous trauma from

2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:41.160
 the work that they do.

2:30:41.160 --> 2:30:45.440
 We have one police officer who is now going, he's a full time police officer.

2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:50.520
 He's also a psychotherapist and he's going through our training program to learn how

2:30:50.520 --> 2:30:54.240
 to give MDMA therapy to other police officers.

2:30:54.240 --> 2:30:58.800
 And I met his police chief a couple of times, he got permission from his police chief to

2:30:58.800 --> 2:31:03.680
 go to the second part of our training program, which is where we give MDMA to therapists

2:31:03.680 --> 2:31:06.440
 who volunteer as a patient.

2:31:06.440 --> 2:31:11.600
 So we have just a couple of weeks ago dosed the police with MDMA.

2:31:11.600 --> 2:31:17.200
 And so I think this idea of those people that are on the, quote, other side, try to see

2:31:17.200 --> 2:31:21.960
 through that to their humanity, to what their pains and suffering, what their struggles

2:31:21.960 --> 2:31:25.320
 are to the extent that you can.

2:31:25.320 --> 2:31:28.880
 And that, I think, and build long term relationships.

2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:32.720
 You never know what's going to come around 20 years from now.

2:31:32.720 --> 2:31:36.600
 So you help some people try to keep these relationships going 20 years from now, something

2:31:36.600 --> 2:31:48.840
 could, could come and, and also be persistent, you know, yeah, I think that's, that's been

2:31:48.840 --> 2:31:49.840
 the key to success.

2:31:49.840 --> 2:31:54.280
 I mean, once the FDA or DEA figured out we're not going anywhere, they're going to have

2:31:54.280 --> 2:31:57.800
 to deal with us, then we started to get some progress.

2:31:57.800 --> 2:32:02.360
 It's a mix of patience and stubbornness that gets things done.

2:32:02.360 --> 2:32:08.920
 Is there something you've figured out through your journey with psychedelics about some

2:32:08.920 --> 2:32:12.040
 of the big why questions about life?

2:32:12.040 --> 2:32:18.440
 Like, like what the heck's the value of love?

2:32:18.440 --> 2:32:22.080
 Why does it suck so much that we die?

2:32:22.080 --> 2:32:27.300
 And for some of us, maybe it's the Russian and me, but it's quite terrifying the notion

2:32:27.300 --> 2:32:33.160
 of it, or the biggest why question of them all, which is what's the meaning of it all?

2:32:33.160 --> 2:32:40.240
 Well, yeah, what I've discovered is that we don't need answers to those questions.

2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:48.280
 You know, that the fact that we can feel happy, you know, that we can love, that we can have

2:32:48.280 --> 2:32:54.840
 moments of happiness, that's enough, you know, figuring out these big questions, you can

2:32:54.840 --> 2:32:59.240
 get lost in that, and we all can come up with our answers.

2:32:59.240 --> 2:33:03.040
 What's the meaning of life, why is there life, why is there consciousness?

2:33:03.040 --> 2:33:06.320
 But I don't know that we need those answers.

2:33:06.320 --> 2:33:14.280
 What we know is that we're social creatures, that other people can make us happy by certain

2:33:14.280 --> 2:33:17.840
 things, we can make other people happy, that one life is enough.

2:33:17.840 --> 2:33:22.880
 So this other part about why is it so tragic that we die.

2:33:22.880 --> 2:33:25.480
 I don't think it's tragic that we die.

2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:32.680
 So first off, if you believe in this collective unconscious, but we have an impact that lasts.

2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:39.480
 But I think that, for me at least, I've been of the view that we should be grateful for

2:33:39.480 --> 2:33:46.000
 death, that death makes life precious, that if we had an infinite amount of time, you

2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:50.440
 know, I mean, I'm a bit of a procrastinator about stuff, particularly things that are

2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:54.280
 really, you know, hard to do, and you just, you know, you just don't do it.

2:33:54.280 --> 2:33:57.080
 And then like, where'd the day go, I was going to do this.

2:33:57.080 --> 2:34:03.520
 So if we had infinite life, we never died, you know, would life be precious?

2:34:03.520 --> 2:34:04.520
 Would we do anything?

2:34:04.520 --> 2:34:05.520
 I don't think so.

2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:12.840
 So my parents gave, you know, every Jewish New Year, they would make their New Year's

2:34:12.840 --> 2:34:14.360
 card.

2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:16.400
 And one of the quotes was fantastic.

2:34:16.400 --> 2:34:21.960
 It was just, we have to make up for the brevity of life with the intensity of life.

2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:25.080
 Oh man, that is good.

2:34:25.080 --> 2:34:30.680
 Well, the end makes things precious, death makes life precious.

2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:34.800
 The end of this conversation makes it precious.

2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:38.120
 And which is a great way to end, Rick.

2:34:38.120 --> 2:34:40.680
 I wanted to talk to you for a long time.

2:34:40.680 --> 2:34:43.240
 I share, you were very excited about the study.

2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:45.760
 I can now understand exactly why.

2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:46.960
 This is really promising.

2:34:46.960 --> 2:34:47.960
 This is really exciting.

2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:53.840
 Gives me hope about the future, even if it doesn't come fast enough.

2:34:53.840 --> 2:34:56.720
 But like you said, have to be patient and stubborn.

2:34:56.720 --> 2:34:59.880
 Thank you so much for wasting all your valuable time with me today.

2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:01.960
 It's truly an honor to meet you and talk to you.

2:35:01.960 --> 2:35:02.960
 Not at waste at all.

2:35:02.960 --> 2:35:06.960
 I really appreciate it this time together.

2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:09.400
 Thank you for listening to this conversation with Rick Doblin.

2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:14.720
 And thank you to Theragun, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and ASleep.

2:35:14.720 --> 2:35:18.000
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:21.800
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Terence McKenna.

2:35:21.800 --> 2:35:23.160
 Nature loves courage.

2:35:23.160 --> 2:35:27.880
 You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible

2:35:27.880 --> 2:35:29.560
 obstacles.

2:35:29.560 --> 2:35:33.200
 Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under.

2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:34.720
 It will lift you up.

2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:36.120
 This is the trick.

2:35:36.120 --> 2:35:41.360
 This is what all the teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the

2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:44.680
 alchemical gold, this is what they understood.

2:35:44.680 --> 2:35:47.520
 This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.

2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:49.320
 This is how magic is done.

2:35:49.320 --> 2:35:54.680
 By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering that it's a featherbed.

2:35:54.680 --> 2:36:15.080
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
