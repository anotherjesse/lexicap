00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
 The following is a conversation with Tyler Cohen, an economist at George Mason University

00:04.960 --> 00:11.520
 and cocreator of an amazing economics blog called Marginal Revolution. Author of many books,

00:11.520 --> 00:17.200
 including The Great Stagnation, Average is Over, and his most recent Big Business,

00:17.200 --> 00:22.480
 a love letter to an American antihero. He's truly a polymath in his work,

00:22.480 --> 00:28.480
 including his love for food, which makes his amazing podcast called Conversations with Tyler

00:28.480 --> 00:34.480
 really fun to listen to. Quick mention of our sponsors, Linode, ExpressVPN,

00:35.040 --> 00:40.160
 Simply Safe, and Public Goods. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:40.880 --> 00:47.600
 As a side note, given Tyler's culinary explorations, let me say that one of the things that makes me

00:47.600 --> 00:54.320
 sad about my love hate relationship with food is that while I've found a simple diet, playing

00:54.320 --> 00:59.680
 meat and veggies that makes me happy in day to day life, I sometimes wish I had the mental

00:59.680 --> 01:04.640
 ability to moderate consumption of food so that I could truly enjoy meals that go way outside of

01:04.640 --> 01:10.880
 that diet. I've seen my mom, for example, enjoy a single piece of chocolate, and yet if I were to

01:10.880 --> 01:16.240
 eat one piece of chocolate, the odds are high that I would end up eating the whole box. This is

01:16.240 --> 01:22.160
 definitely something I would like to fix because some of the amazing artistry in this world happens

01:22.160 --> 01:28.000
 in the kitchen, and some of the richest human experiences happen over a unique meal. I recently

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
 was eating cheeseburgers with Joe Rogan and John Donahar late at night in Austin, talking about

01:34.000 --> 01:41.600
 jiu jitsu in life, and I was distinctly aware of the magic of that experience, magic made possible

01:41.600 --> 01:47.840
 by the incredibly delicious cheeseburgers. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my

01:47.840 --> 01:55.760
 conversation with Tyler Cohen. Would you say economics is more art or science or philosophy

01:55.760 --> 02:01.920
 or even magic? What is it? Economics is interesting because it's all of the above. To start with

02:01.920 --> 02:07.120
 magic, the notion that you can make some change and simply everyone's better off, that is a kind

02:07.120 --> 02:13.120
 of modern magic that has replaced old style magic. It's an art in the sense that the models are not

02:13.120 --> 02:18.400
 very exact. It's a science in the sense that occasionally propositions are falsified,

02:18.400 --> 02:23.360
 or a few basic things we know, and however trivial they may sound if you don't know them,

02:23.360 --> 02:29.200
 you're out of luck. So all of the above. But from my outsider's perspective, economics

02:29.840 --> 02:37.920
 is sometimes able to formulate very simple, almost like E equals MC squared, general models of how

02:37.920 --> 02:46.320
 our human society will function when you do a certain thing. But it seems impossible or almost

02:46.320 --> 02:52.240
 way too optimistic to think that a single formula or just a set of simple principles can describe

02:53.760 --> 02:58.080
 behavior of billions of human beings with all the complexity that we have involved.

02:58.880 --> 03:06.640
 Do you have a sense there's a hope for economics to have those kinds of physics level descriptions

03:06.640 --> 03:11.360
 and models of the world, or is it just our desperate attempts as humans to make sense of it even though

03:11.360 --> 03:19.840
 it's more desperate than rigorous and serious and actually predictable, like a physics type science?

03:20.400 --> 03:25.600
 I don't think economics will ever be very predictive. It's most useful for helping you

03:25.600 --> 03:31.040
 ask better questions. You look at something like game theory. Well, game theory never predicted

03:31.040 --> 03:36.960
 USA and USSR would have a war, would not have a war. But trying to think through the logic

03:36.960 --> 03:41.200
 of strategic conflict, if you know game theory, it's just a much more interesting discussion.

03:42.320 --> 03:48.320
 Are you surprised that we, speaking of Soviet Union and United States and speaking of game

03:48.320 --> 03:51.920
 theory, are you surprised that we haven't destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons yet,

03:51.920 --> 03:57.440
 like that simple formulation of mutually assured destruction? That's a good example

03:57.440 --> 04:03.840
 of an explanation that perhaps allows us to ask better questions, but it seems to have actually

04:03.840 --> 04:10.640
 described the reality of why we haven't destroyed ourselves with these ultra powerful weapons.

04:10.640 --> 04:16.160
 Are you surprised? Do you think the game theory explanation is at all accurate there?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.840
 I think we will destroy each other with those weapons.

04:19.840 --> 04:20.480
 Eventually?

04:20.480 --> 04:26.480
 Eventually. Look, it's a very low probability event. So I'm not surprised it hasn't happened yet.

04:26.480 --> 04:31.760
 I'm a little surprised it came as close as it did. Your general thinking, realizing it might

04:31.760 --> 04:36.160
 have just been a flock of birds or it wasn't a first strike attack from the USA, we got very

04:36.160 --> 04:41.200
 lucky on that one. But if you just keep on running the clock on a low probability event,

04:42.080 --> 04:48.240
 it will happen. And it may not be USA and China, USA and Russia, whatever. It could be the Saudis

04:48.240 --> 04:51.440
 and Turkey. And it might not be nuclear weapons. It might be some other destruction.

04:51.440 --> 04:57.600
 Bio weapons. But it simply will happen, is my view. And I've argued at best we have seven or

04:57.600 --> 05:01.920
 eight hundred years and that's being generous. At worst, how long we got?

05:02.880 --> 05:08.160
 Well, maybe it's asking for a friend, a rival process, right? So tiny probability could come

05:08.160 --> 05:16.400
 anytime, probably not in your lifetime. But the chance presumably increases. The cheaper

05:16.400 --> 05:23.040
 weapons of mass destruction are. So the Poisson process description doesn't take in consideration

05:23.040 --> 05:28.800
 the game theoretic aspect. So another way to consider is repeated games, iterative games.

05:29.680 --> 05:36.640
 So is there something about our human nature that allows us to fight against probability,

05:37.200 --> 05:43.680
 reduce like the closer we get to trouble, the more we're able to figure out how to avoid trouble.

05:43.680 --> 05:49.200
 The same thing is for when you take exams or you go ahead and take classes, the closer you

05:49.200 --> 05:53.520
 or paper deadlines, the closer you get to a deadline, the better you start to perform and

05:53.520 --> 05:58.560
 get your shit together and actually get stuff done. I'm really not so negative on human nature.

05:58.560 --> 06:03.760
 And as an economist, I very much see the gains from cooperation. But if you just ask,

06:03.760 --> 06:08.400
 are there outliers in history, like was there a Hitler? For instance, obviously. And again,

06:08.400 --> 06:13.920
 you let the clock tick another Hitler with nuclear weapons, doesn't per se care about

06:13.920 --> 06:18.960
 his own destruction, it will happen. So your sense is fundamentally people are good.

06:20.240 --> 06:24.720
 A trembling hand equilibrium is what we would call it. Trumbling hand equilibrium.

06:25.360 --> 06:32.240
 That the basic logic is for cooperation, which is mostly what we've seen, even between enemies.

06:32.240 --> 06:36.640
 But every now and then, someone does something crazy and you don't know how to react to it.

06:36.640 --> 06:40.880
 And you can't always beat Hitler. Sometimes Hitler drags you down.

06:41.520 --> 06:48.400
 To push back is it possible that the crazier the person, the less likely they are.

06:49.600 --> 06:56.880
 And in a way where we're safe, meaning like, this is the kind of proposition I've had. I had

06:56.880 --> 07:03.840
 the discussion with my dad as a physicist about this, where he thinks that if you have a graph,

07:03.840 --> 07:11.280
 like evil people can't also be geniuses. So this is his defense why evil people will not get control

07:11.280 --> 07:18.080
 of nuclear weapons, because to be truly evil. But evil meaning, sort of, you can argue that

07:18.080 --> 07:23.680
 not even the evil of Hitler we're talking about, because Hitler had a kind of view of Germany

07:23.680 --> 07:29.040
 and all those kinds of, there's like, he probably diluted himself and the people around him to think

07:29.040 --> 07:33.840
 that he's actually doing good for the world, similar with Stalin and so on. By evil, I mean,

07:33.840 --> 07:38.880
 more like almost like terrorists to where they want to destroy themselves and the world.

07:38.880 --> 07:45.440
 Like those people will never be able to be actually skilled enough to do, to deliver that kind of

07:45.440 --> 07:53.600
 mass scale destruction. So the hope is that it's very unlikely that the kind of evil that would

07:53.600 --> 08:00.640
 lead to extinctions of humans or mass destruction is so unlikely that we're able to last way longer

08:00.640 --> 08:02.880
 than some 100, 800 years.

08:02.880 --> 08:08.720
 I agree. It's very unlikely in that sense. I accept the argument, but that's why you need to let the

08:08.720 --> 08:14.160
 clock tick. It's also the best argument for bureaucracy. To negotiate a bureaucracy, it

08:14.160 --> 08:19.040
 actually selects against pure evil, because you need to build alliances. So bureaucracy in that

08:19.040 --> 08:24.960
 regard is great. It keeps out the worst apples. But look, put it this way. Could you imagine 35

08:24.960 --> 08:32.480
 years from now, the Osama bin Laden of the future has nukes or very bad bio weapons? It seems to me

08:32.480 --> 08:39.680
 you can. And Osama was pretty evil and actually even he failed, right? But nonetheless, that's

08:39.680 --> 08:42.240
 what the 700 or 800 years is there for.

08:42.240 --> 08:48.160
 And it might be destructive technology that don't have such a high cost of production or

08:48.160 --> 08:53.280
 production or such a high learning curve, like cyber attacks or artificial intelligence,

08:53.280 --> 08:55.680
 all those kinds of things. So yeah.

08:55.680 --> 09:00.560
 I mean, let me ask you a question. Let's say you could as an active will by spending a million

09:00.560 --> 09:06.880
 dollars obliterate any city on earth and everyone in it dies and you'll get caught and you'll be

09:06.880 --> 09:12.240
 sentenced to death, but you can make it happen just by willing it. How many months does it take

09:12.240 --> 09:13.840
 before that happens?

09:13.840 --> 09:19.520
 So the obvious answer is like very soon. There's probably a good answer for that because you

09:19.520 --> 09:22.640
 can consider how many millionaires there are, how many you can look at that, right?

09:22.640 --> 09:23.520
 Right.

09:23.520 --> 09:30.880
 I have a sense that there's just people that have a million dollars. I mean, there's a certain

09:30.880 --> 09:39.600
 amount, but have a million dollars have other interests that will outweigh the interest of

09:39.600 --> 09:46.480
 destroying the entire city. Maybe that's a hope.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.560
 It's why we should be nice to the wealthy too, right?

09:51.200 --> 09:57.040
 Yeah. All that trash talking is Bill Gates. We should stop that because that doesn't inspire

09:57.040 --> 09:59.840
 the other future Bill Gates is to be nice to the world.

10:00.960 --> 10:06.560
 That's true. But your sense is the cheaper he gets to destroy the world, the more likely he becomes.

10:06.560 --> 10:11.200
 Now, when I say destroy the world, there's a trick in there. I don't think literally every

10:11.200 --> 10:16.960
 human will die, but it would set back civilization by an extraordinary degree. It's then just

10:16.960 --> 10:22.560
 hard to predict what comes next. But a catastrophe where everyone dies, that probably has to be

10:22.560 --> 10:28.720
 something more like an asteroid or supernova. And those are purely exogenous for the time being,

10:28.720 --> 10:29.600
 at least.

10:29.600 --> 10:34.560
 So I immigrated to this country. I was born in the Soviet Union in Russia.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.240
 Which one?

10:36.240 --> 10:41.440
 Again, it's an important question. You were born in the Soviet Union, right?

10:41.440 --> 10:46.480
 Yes, I was born in the Soviet Union. The rest is details, but I grew up in Moscow, Russia.

10:47.360 --> 10:53.920
 But I came to this country, and this country even back there, but it's always symbolized to me

10:53.920 --> 11:01.680
 a place of opportunity where everybody could build the most incredible things, especially

11:01.680 --> 11:07.920
 in the engineering side of things. Just invent and build and scale and have a huge impact on the

11:07.920 --> 11:13.760
 world. And that's been, to me, that's my version of the American ideal, the American dream.

11:15.360 --> 11:23.760
 Do you think the American dream is still there? What do you think of that notion in itself,

11:23.760 --> 11:28.080
 from an economics perspective, from a human perspective, is it still alive?

11:28.080 --> 11:30.720
 And how do you think about it, the American dream?

11:30.720 --> 11:36.400
 The American dream is mostly still there. If you look at which groups are the highest earners,

11:37.280 --> 11:43.280
 it is individuals from India and individuals from Iran, which is a fairly new development,

11:43.280 --> 11:49.120
 great for them, not necessarily easy. Both you could call persons of color, may have faced

11:49.120 --> 11:54.800
 discrimination, also on the grounds of religion, yet they've done it. That's amazing. It says

11:54.800 --> 11:59.600
 great things about America. Now, if you look at native born Americans, the story is trickier.

11:59.600 --> 12:06.400
 People think intergenerational mobility has declined a lot recently, but it has not

12:06.400 --> 12:11.760
 for native born Americans. For about, I think, 40 years, it's been fairly constant,

12:11.760 --> 12:18.640
 which is sort of good. But compared to much earlier times, it was much higher in the past.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.440
 I'm not sure we can replicate that because, look, go to the beginning of the 20th century,

12:23.440 --> 12:29.120
 very few Americans finish high school or even have much wealth. There's not much credentialism,

12:29.120 --> 12:34.400
 there aren't that many credentials. So there's more upward mobility across the generations than

12:34.400 --> 12:39.440
 today. And it's a good thing that we had it. I'm not sure we should blame the modern world

12:40.160 --> 12:46.880
 for not being able to reproduce that. But look, the general issue of who gets into Harvard or

12:46.880 --> 12:52.320
 Cornell, is there an injustice? Should we fix that? Is there too little opportunity for the

12:52.320 --> 12:58.000
 bottoms, say, half of Americans? Absolutely. It's a disgrace how this country has evolved in that

12:58.000 --> 13:03.840
 way. And in that sense, the American dream is clearly ailing. But it has had problems from

13:03.840 --> 13:08.480
 the beginning for blacks, for women, for many other groups. I mean, isn't that the whole

13:08.480 --> 13:15.200
 challenge of opportunity and freedom is that it's hard and the difficulty of how hard it is to move

13:15.200 --> 13:21.840
 up in society is unequal often? And that's the injustice of society. But the whole point of

13:21.840 --> 13:29.680
 that freedom is that over time, it becomes better and better. You start to fix the leaks,

13:30.240 --> 13:36.640
 the issues, and it keeps progressing in that kind of way. But ultimately, there's always the

13:36.640 --> 13:41.680
 opportunity, even if it's harder, there's the opportunity to create something truly special,

13:41.680 --> 13:48.480
 to move up, to be president, to be a leader in whatever the industry that you're passionate about.

13:48.480 --> 13:54.400
 To have it, we each have podcasts in English. The value of joining that American English

13:54.400 --> 13:59.520
 language network is much higher today than it was 30 years ago, mostly because of the internet.

14:00.160 --> 14:06.480
 So that makes immigration returns themselves skewed. So going to the US, Canada, or the UK,

14:07.120 --> 14:11.200
 I think has become much more valuable in relative terms than, say, going to France,

14:11.200 --> 14:13.600
 which is still a pretty well off, very nice country.

14:13.600 --> 14:21.680
 If you had gone to France, your chance of having a globally known podcast would be much smaller.

14:21.680 --> 14:28.480
 Yeah, this is the interesting thing about how much intellectual influence the United States has.

14:28.480 --> 14:33.440
 I don't know if it's connected to what we're discussing here, the freedom and the opportunity

14:33.440 --> 14:40.400
 of the American dream. Or does it make any sense to you that we have so much impact on the rest

14:40.400 --> 14:48.880
 of the world in terms of ideas? Is it just simply because the English is the primary language of

14:48.880 --> 14:54.160
 the world? Or is there something fundamental to the United States that drives the development

14:54.160 --> 15:04.320
 of ideas? It's almost like what's cool, what's entertaining, what's meme culture, the internet

15:04.320 --> 15:12.080
 culture, the philosophers, the intellectuals, the podcasts, the movies, music, all that stuff,

15:12.080 --> 15:16.480
 driving culture. There's something above and beyond language in the United States.

15:16.480 --> 15:21.520
 It's a sense of entertainment, really mattering how to connect with your audience, being direct

15:21.520 --> 15:27.840
 and getting to the point, how humor is integrated even with science that is pretty

15:28.960 --> 15:32.560
 strongly represented here, much more say than on the European continent.

15:32.560 --> 15:37.120
 Britain has its own version of this, which it does very well. And not surprisingly,

15:37.120 --> 15:42.400
 they're hugely influential in music, comedy, most of the other areas you mentioned. Canada,

15:42.400 --> 15:47.680
 yes, but their best talent tends to come here. But you could say it's like a broader North American

15:47.680 --> 15:55.520
 thing and give them their fair share of credit. What about science? There's a sense higher education

15:55.520 --> 15:59.760
 is really strong, research is really strong in the United States, but it just feels like

15:59.760 --> 16:05.760
 culturally speaking, when we zoom out, scientists aren't very cool here.

16:07.360 --> 16:14.080
 Most people wouldn't be able to name basically a single scientist. Maybe they would say Einstein

16:14.080 --> 16:18.640
 and Neil deGrasse Tyson, maybe. And Neil deGrasse Tyson isn't exactly a scientist,

16:18.640 --> 16:28.160
 he's a science communicator. So there's not the same kind of admiration of science and innovators

16:28.160 --> 16:34.400
 as there is of athletes or actors, actresses, musicians.

16:34.960 --> 16:40.080
 Well, you can become a celebrity scientist if you want to, may or may not be best for science.

16:40.080 --> 16:45.760
 And we have Spock from Star Trek, who is still a big deal. But look at it this way,

16:45.760 --> 16:50.800
 which country is most comfortable with any egalitarian rewards for scientists,

16:50.800 --> 16:55.360
 whether it's fame or money? And I still think it's here. Some of that's just the tax rate.

16:55.360 --> 16:59.520
 Some of it is a lot of America is set up for rich people to live really well.

17:00.160 --> 17:05.280
 And again, that's going to attract a lot of top talent. And you ask the two best vaccines. I

17:05.280 --> 17:11.520
 know the Pfizer vaccine is sorted from Germany, sorted from Turkey, but it's nonetheless being

17:11.520 --> 17:17.840
 distributed through the United States, Moderna, an ethnic Armenian immigrant through Lebanon,

17:17.840 --> 17:22.800
 first to Canada, then down here to Boston, Cambridge area. Those are incredible vaccines,

17:22.800 --> 17:27.760
 and US nailed it. Yeah. Well, that's more almost like the,

17:28.720 --> 17:33.920
 I don't know what you would call it, engineering the sort of scaling. That's what US is really good

17:33.920 --> 17:38.480
 as, not just inventing of ideas, but taking an idea and actually building the thing and

17:38.480 --> 17:44.720
 scaling it and being able to distribute it at scale. I think some people would have attributed

17:44.720 --> 17:53.520
 that to the general word of capitalism. I don't know if you would. Sure. What in your views are

17:53.520 --> 18:00.480
 the pros and cons of capitalism as it's implemented in America? I don't know if you would say

18:00.480 --> 18:05.600
 capitalism has really existed in America, but to the extent that it does. People use the word

18:05.600 --> 18:11.520
 capitalism in so many different ways. What is capitalism? The literal meaning is private

18:11.520 --> 18:17.600
 ownership of capital goods, which I favor in most areas, but no, I don't think the private sector

18:17.600 --> 18:24.240
 should own our F16s or military assets. Government owned water utilities seem to work as well as

18:24.240 --> 18:31.520
 privately owned water utilities, but with all those qualifications put to the side, business,

18:32.720 --> 18:37.920
 for the most part, innovates better than government. It is oriented toward consumer services.

18:37.920 --> 18:43.520
 The biggest businesses tend to pay the highest wages. Business is great at getting things done.

18:43.520 --> 18:49.040
 USA is fundamentally a nation of business, and that makes us a nation of opportunity,

18:49.040 --> 18:57.600
 so I am indeed mostly a fan, subject to numerous caveats. What's a con? What are some negative

18:57.600 --> 19:04.560
 downsides of capitalism in your view or some things that we should be concerned about maybe for

19:04.560 --> 19:11.520
 long term impacts of capitalism? Capitalism takes a different form in each country. I would say in

19:11.520 --> 19:17.840
 the United States, our weird blend of whatever you want to call it, has had an enduring racial

19:17.840 --> 19:24.080
 problem from the beginning, has been a force of taking away land from Native Americans and

19:24.080 --> 19:33.760
 oppressing them pretty much from the beginning. It has done very well by immigrants for the most part.

19:34.880 --> 19:41.040
 We revel in chimpaterian creative destruction more, so we don't just prop up national champions

19:41.040 --> 19:46.480
 forever, and there is a precariousness to life for some people here that is less so,

19:46.480 --> 19:51.840
 say, in Germany or the Netherlands. We have weaker communities in some regards than,

19:51.840 --> 19:56.560
 say, Northwestern Europe often would. That has pluses and minuses. I think it makes us

19:56.560 --> 20:01.680
 more creative. It's a better country in which to be a weirdo than, say, Germany or Denmark,

20:02.240 --> 20:07.440
 but there is truly, whether from the government or from your private community, there is less

20:07.440 --> 20:14.320
 social security in some fundamental sense. On the point of weirdo, that's kind of a beautiful

20:14.320 --> 20:23.520
 little statement. What is that? That seems to be, you could think of a guy like Elon Musk

20:23.520 --> 20:28.400
 and say that he's a weirdo. Is that the sense in which you're using weirdo outside of the norm,

20:29.200 --> 20:35.760
 breaking conventions? Absolutely. Here, that is either acceptable or even admired or to be a

20:35.760 --> 20:41.840
 loner. Since so many people are outsiders, and that where all immigrants are selecting for people

20:41.840 --> 20:46.320
 who left something behind, were willing to leave behind their families, were willing to undergo

20:46.320 --> 20:53.760
 a certain brutality of switch in their lives, makes us a nation of weirdos, and weirdos are

20:53.760 --> 21:01.440
 creative. Denmark is not a nation of weirdos. It's a wonderful place, great for them. Ideally,

21:01.440 --> 21:05.520
 you want part of the world to be fully weirdos and innovating, and the other part of the world

21:05.520 --> 21:12.480
 to be a little kind of chicken shit, risk averse, and enjoy the benefits of innovation, and to give

21:12.480 --> 21:18.560
 people these smooth lives in six weeks off and free ride. Everyone's like, oh, American way versus

21:18.560 --> 21:23.520
 European way, but basically they're compliments. Yeah, that's fascinating. I used to have this

21:23.520 --> 21:29.360
 conversation with my parents when I was growing up, and just others from the immigrant kind of

21:29.360 --> 21:36.320
 flow, and they used this term, especially in Russian, is to criticize something I was doing,

21:36.320 --> 21:43.120
 that would suggest normal people don't do this. I used to be really offended by that,

21:44.400 --> 21:54.560
 but as I got older, I realized that that's a kind of compliment, because in the same kind of,

21:54.560 --> 22:01.040
 I would say, way that you're saying that is the American ideal, because if you want to do

22:01.040 --> 22:07.040
 anything special or interesting, you don't want to be doing in one particular avenue what normal

22:07.040 --> 22:14.640
 people do, because that won't be interesting. The Russians, I think, fit in very well here,

22:14.640 --> 22:18.880
 because the ones who come are weirdos, and there's a very different Russian weirdo tradition,

22:18.880 --> 22:26.160
 like Alyosha, or Perlman, the mathematician. They're weirdos, and they have their own

22:26.160 --> 22:32.240
 different kind of status in Soviet Union, Russia, wherever. When Russians come to America,

22:32.240 --> 22:36.880
 they stay pretty Russian, but it seems to me, a week later, they've somehow adjusted,

22:37.840 --> 22:42.400
 and the ways in which they might want to be grumpier than Americans, not smile, think the

22:42.400 --> 22:46.720
 people who smile are idiots. They can do that. No one takes that away from them.

22:46.720 --> 22:53.920
 Yeah. Yeah. What are you on the tiny tangent? I'd love to hear a few thoughts about Grisha Perlman

22:54.880 --> 23:00.800
 turning down the Fields Medal. Is that something you admire? Does that make sense to you that somebody,

23:02.080 --> 23:06.240
 we have the structure of Nobel Prizes, of these huge awards, of the reputations,

23:06.240 --> 23:12.960
 the hierarchy of everyone saying, applauding how special you are, and here's a person who was

23:12.960 --> 23:16.720
 doing one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of mathematics. It doesn't want

23:16.720 --> 23:21.120
 the stupid prize and doesn't want recognition, doesn't want to do interviews, it doesn't want to be

23:21.120 --> 23:27.920
 famous. What do you make of that? It's great. Look, prizes are corrupting. After scientists win

23:27.920 --> 23:32.960
 Nobel Prizes, they tend to become less productive. Now, statistically, it's hard to sort out the

23:32.960 --> 23:36.800
 different effects. There's a Russian toward the mean. Does the prize make you too busy? It's a

23:36.800 --> 23:43.440
 little tricky, but there's not enough Nobel Prizes either to gather enough data. Right. But I've

23:43.440 --> 23:48.240
 known a lot of Nobel Prize winners, and it is my sense they become less productive. They repeat

23:48.240 --> 23:53.280
 more of their older messages, which may be highly socially valuable. But if someone wants to turn

23:53.280 --> 23:59.520
 their back on that and keep on working, which I assume is what he's doing, that's awesome. I mean,

23:59.520 --> 24:04.160
 we should respect that. It's like he wins a bigger prize, our extreme respect.

24:04.160 --> 24:14.160
 Yeah. Well, Grisha, if you're listening, you need to talk to you soon. Okay. I've been trying to

24:14.160 --> 24:20.720
 get ahold of them. Okay. Back to capitalism. I got to ask you, just competition in general in

24:20.720 --> 24:28.000
 this world of weirdos. Is competition good for the world? This kind of seems to be one of the

24:28.000 --> 24:33.600
 fundamental engines of capitalism. Do you see it as ultimately constructive or destructive for the

24:33.600 --> 24:40.720
 world? What really matters is how good your legal framework is. So competition within nature for food

24:40.720 --> 24:45.200
 leads to bloody conflict all the time. The animal world is quite unpleasant, to say the least.

24:46.240 --> 24:52.640
 If you have something like the rule of law and clearly defined property rights, which are

24:52.640 --> 24:59.200
 within reason, justly allocated, competition probably is going to work very well. But it's

24:59.200 --> 25:05.440
 not an unalloyed good thing at all. It can be highly destructive, military competition, which

25:05.440 --> 25:11.200
 actually is itself sometimes good, but it's not good per se. What aspects of life do you think

25:11.200 --> 25:17.440
 we should protect from competition? You said like the rule of law, is there some things we

25:17.440 --> 25:23.120
 should keep away from competition? Well, the fight for territory most of all. The violence,

25:23.120 --> 25:27.120
 anything that involves actual physical violence. Right. And it's not that I think the current

25:27.120 --> 25:33.280
 borders are just, I mean, go talk to Hungarians, Romanians, Serbians, Bosnians, they'll talk

25:33.280 --> 25:38.960
 your ear off. And some of them are probably right. But at the end of the day, we have some kind of

25:38.960 --> 25:45.360
 international order. And I would rather be more or less stick with it. If Catalonians want to

25:45.360 --> 25:51.040
 leave, they keep up with it, let them go. But what about a space of healthcare? This is where

25:51.040 --> 25:58.640
 you get into a tension of between capitalism and I don't want to use socialism, but those kinds

25:58.640 --> 26:04.720
 of policies, they're less free market. I think in this country, healthcare should be much more

26:04.720 --> 26:10.320
 competitive. So you go to hospitals, doctors, they don't treat you like a customer. They treat you

26:10.320 --> 26:15.920
 like an idiot or like a child or someone with third party payment. And it's a pretty humiliating

26:15.920 --> 26:24.160
 experience often. Yeah. Do you think free market in general is possible? Like a pure free market?

26:25.040 --> 26:31.200
 And is that a good goal to strive for? I don't think the term pure free market is well defined

26:31.200 --> 26:36.320
 because you need a legal order. The legal order has to make decisions on what is intellectual

26:36.320 --> 26:42.240
 property more important than ever. There's no benchmark that represents the pure free market

26:42.240 --> 26:48.400
 way of doing things. What will penalties be? How much do we put into law enforcement? No simple

26:48.400 --> 26:52.800
 answers, but just saying free market doesn't pin down what you're going to do on those all

26:52.800 --> 26:59.760
 important questions. So free market is an economics idea. So it's not possible for free

26:59.760 --> 27:04.960
 market to generate the rules. They're like emergent, like self governing. It generates a lot of them

27:04.960 --> 27:09.920
 right through private norms, through trade associations. International trade is mostly done

27:09.920 --> 27:16.720
 privately and by norms. So it's certainly possible. But at the end of the day, I think you need

27:16.720 --> 27:23.280
 governments to draw very clear lines to prevent it from turning into mafia run systems.

27:24.000 --> 27:30.560
 You know, I've been hanging out with other group of weirdos lately, Michael Malis,

27:30.560 --> 27:41.440
 who espouses to be an anarchist anarchism, which is like, I think intellectually, just a fascinating

27:41.440 --> 27:48.640
 set of ideas where, you know, taking free market to the full extreme of basically saying there

27:48.640 --> 27:57.680
 should be no, no government. What is it? Oversight, I guess. And then everything should be fully

27:57.680 --> 28:00.560
 like all the agreements, all the collectives you form should be

28:02.240 --> 28:07.760
 voluntary, not based on the geographic land you were born on and so on. Do you think

28:08.480 --> 28:14.240
 that's just a giant mess? Like, do you think it's possible for an anarchist society to work where

28:14.240 --> 28:21.840
 it's, you know, in a fully distributed way, people agree with each other, not just on financial

28:21.840 --> 28:29.680
 transactions, but, you know, on their personal security, on sort of military type of stuff,

28:30.800 --> 28:35.520
 on health care, on education, all those kinds of things. And where does it break down?

28:35.520 --> 28:39.920
 Well, I wouldn't press a button to say get rid of our current constitution, which I view is pretty

28:39.920 --> 28:45.760
 good and quite wise. But I think the deeper point is that all societies are in some regards

28:45.760 --> 28:50.800
 anarchistic. And we should take the anarchist seriously. So globally, there's a kind of anarchy

28:50.800 --> 28:58.400
 across borders, even within federalistic systems. They're typically complex. There's not a clear

28:58.400 --> 29:05.120
 transitivity necessarily of who has the final say over what. Just the state vis a vis its people.

29:05.120 --> 29:12.000
 There's not, per se, a final arbitrator in that regard. So you want a good anarchy rather than

29:12.000 --> 29:16.800
 a bad anarchy. You want to squish your anarchy into the right corners. And I don't think there's a

29:16.800 --> 29:22.640
 theoretical answer how to do it. But you start with a country like, is it working well enough now?

29:23.440 --> 29:28.400
 This country, you'd say mostly, you'd certainly want to make a lot of improvements. And that's

29:28.400 --> 29:32.480
 why I don't want to press that get rid of the constitution button. But to just dump on the

29:32.480 --> 29:37.840
 anarchists is to miss the point. Always try to learn from any opinion, you know, and what in it

29:37.840 --> 29:45.680
 is true? I'm just like marveling at the poetry of saying that we should squish our anarchy into

29:45.680 --> 29:51.600
 the right corners. I love it. Okay, I gotta ask, I've been talking with,

29:53.760 --> 29:58.320
 since we're doing a whirlwind introduction to all of economics, I've been talking to a few

29:58.320 --> 30:05.600
 objectivists recently. And just, you know, I ran comes up as a, as a person, as a philosopher,

30:05.600 --> 30:10.160
 throughout many conversations, a lot of people really despise her. A lot of people really love

30:10.160 --> 30:16.160
 her. It's always weird to me when somebody arouses a philosophy or a human being arouses that much

30:16.160 --> 30:22.640
 emotion in either direction. Does she make, do you understand, first of all, that level of emotion?

30:22.640 --> 30:28.000
 And what are your thoughts about Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism? Is it useful at all

30:28.880 --> 30:36.000
 to think about this kind of formulation of rational self interest, if I could put it in those words,

30:36.000 --> 30:45.600
 or, I guess, more negatively, the selfishness, or she would put, I guess, the virtue of selfishness?

30:46.320 --> 30:50.720
 Ayn Rand was the big influence on me growing up. The book that really mattered for me was

30:50.720 --> 30:57.200
 capitalism, the unknown ideal, the notion that wealth creates opportunity and good lives,

30:57.200 --> 31:02.640
 and wealth is something we ought to valorize and give very high status. It's one of her key ideas.

31:02.640 --> 31:07.600
 I think it's completely correct. I think she has the most profound and articulate statement of that

31:07.600 --> 31:14.320
 idea. That said, as a philosopher, I disagree with her on most things. And I did, even like as a boy

31:14.320 --> 31:19.280
 when I was reading her, I read Plato before Ayn Rand. And in a Socratic dialogue, there's all

31:19.280 --> 31:23.920
 these different points of view being thrown around. And whomever it is you agree with,

31:23.920 --> 31:29.200
 you understand the wisdom is coming together at the different points of view. And she doesn't

31:29.200 --> 31:35.280
 have that. So altruism can be wonderful in my view. Humans are not actually that rational.

31:35.280 --> 31:40.960
 Self interest is often poorly defined. To pound the table and say existence exists.

31:40.960 --> 31:45.600
 I wouldn't say I disagree, but I'm not sure that it's a very meaningful statement.

31:46.320 --> 31:50.720
 I think the secret to Ayn Rand is that she was Russian. I'd love to have her on my podcast

31:50.720 --> 31:56.000
 if she was still alive. I'd only ask her about Russia, which she mostly never talked about

31:56.000 --> 32:01.520
 after writing We the Living. And she is much more Russian than she seems at first,

32:01.520 --> 32:06.480
 even like purging people from the objectivist circles. It's like how Russians, especially

32:06.480 --> 32:11.040
 female Russians, so often purge their friends. It's weird, all the parallels.

32:11.040 --> 32:19.040
 So you're saying, so yes, assuming she's still not around. But if she is and she comes into

32:19.040 --> 32:26.480
 your podcast, can you dig into that a little bit? Do you mean her personal demons around

32:27.200 --> 32:32.720
 the social and economic Russia of the time when she escaped?

32:32.720 --> 32:37.280
 The traumas she suffered there. What she really likes in the music and literature and why.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.480
 Music and literature.

32:38.480 --> 32:42.720
 And getting deeply into that, her view of relations between the sexes and Russia,

32:42.720 --> 32:48.480
 how it differs from America, why she still carries through the old Russian vision in her

32:48.480 --> 32:54.080
 fiction, this extreme sexual dimorphism, but with also very strong women. To me,

32:54.080 --> 32:59.040
 as a uniquely, at least Eastern European vision, mostly Russian, I would say.

33:00.240 --> 33:05.040
 And that's in her. That's her actual real philosophy, not this table bounding existence

33:05.040 --> 33:11.120
 exists. And that's not talked about enough. She's a Russian philosopher or Soviet,

33:11.120 --> 33:12.320
 whatever you want to call it.

33:12.320 --> 33:16.720
 And if she wasn't so certain, she could have been a Dostoyevsky where it's not

33:16.720 --> 33:23.200
 not that that certainty is almost the thing that brings over the adoration of millions,

33:23.200 --> 33:25.120
 but also the hatred of millions.

33:25.120 --> 33:28.160
 You became a cult figure in a somewhat Russian like manner.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.240
 Yeah. Yeah.

33:30.240 --> 33:37.040
 It is. It is what it is. But I love the idea that again, you're just dropping bombs that are poetic,

33:37.040 --> 33:42.400
 that the wisdom is in the coming together of ideas. It's kind of interesting to think that

33:42.400 --> 33:51.280
 that no one human possesses wisdom. No one idea is the wisdom, that the coming together is the

33:51.280 --> 33:52.080
 wisdom.

33:52.080 --> 33:57.440
 Like in my view, Boswell's life of Johnson, 18th century British biography. It's in essence

33:57.440 --> 34:02.480
 a coauthored work, Boswell and Johnson. It's one of the greatest philosophy books ever,

34:02.480 --> 34:07.840
 though it is commonly regarded as a biography. John Stuart Mill, who in a sense was coauthoring

34:07.840 --> 34:12.960
 with Harriet Teller, a better philosopher than is realized, though he's rated very,

34:12.960 --> 34:19.760
 very highly. Plato slash Socrates, a lot of the greatest works are in a kind of dialogue form,

34:19.760 --> 34:25.920
 Kurtis Faust, would be another example. It's very much a dialogue. And yes, it's drama,

34:25.920 --> 34:30.160
 but it's also philosophy, Shakespeare, maybe the wisest thinker of them all.

34:30.160 --> 34:37.600
 In your book, Big Business, speaking of Iron Rand, Big Business, a love letter to an American

34:37.600 --> 34:43.920
 antihero, you make the case for the benefit that large businesses bring to society. Can you explain?

34:45.040 --> 34:50.000
 If you look at, say, the pandemic, which has been a catastrophic event, right, for many reasons,

34:51.040 --> 34:58.160
 but who is it that saved us? So Amazon has done remarkably well. They upped their delivery game

34:58.160 --> 35:02.960
 more or less overnight with very few hitches. I've ordered hundreds of Amazon packages,

35:03.600 --> 35:09.360
 direct delivery food, whether it's DoorDash or Uber Eats or using Whole Foods through Amazon

35:09.360 --> 35:15.680
 shipping. Again, it's gone remarkably well. Switching over our entire higher educational system,

35:15.680 --> 35:21.040
 basically within two weeks to Zoom. Zoom did it. I mean, I've had a Zoom outage,

35:21.040 --> 35:27.440
 but their performance rate has been remarkably high. So if you just look at resources, competence,

35:27.440 --> 35:33.760
 incentives, who's been the star performers, the NBA even, just canceling the season as early as

35:33.760 --> 35:38.720
 they did, sending a message like, hey, people, this is real. And then pulling off the bubble.

35:39.360 --> 35:43.920
 It's not a single found case of COVID and having all the testing set up in advance.

35:44.960 --> 35:50.560
 Big Business has done very well lately. And throughout the broader course of American history,

35:50.560 --> 36:00.000
 in my view, has mostly been a hero. Can we engage in a therapy session? I'm often troubled by

36:00.720 --> 36:07.440
 the negativity towards big business. And I wonder if you could help figure out how

36:08.400 --> 36:15.200
 we've removed that or maybe first psychoanalyze it and then how we remove it. It feels like

36:15.200 --> 36:25.120
 once we've gotten Wi Fi on flights, on airplane flights, people start complaining about how

36:25.120 --> 36:30.560
 shady the connection is, right? They take it for granted immediately. And then start complaining

36:30.560 --> 36:39.760
 about little details. Another example that's closer to, especially as an aspiring entrepreneur is

36:39.760 --> 36:46.880
 closer to the things I'm thinking about is Jack Dorsey with Twitter. To me, Twitter has enabled

36:46.880 --> 36:52.640
 an incredible platform of communication. And yet the biggest thing that people talk about

36:53.360 --> 37:01.600
 is not how incredible this platform is. They essentially use the platform to complain about

37:01.600 --> 37:07.360
 the censorship of a few individuals, as opposed to how amazing it is. Now, you should also,

37:07.360 --> 37:12.480
 you should talk about how shady the Wi Fi is and how censorship or the removal of Donald Trump from

37:12.480 --> 37:18.560
 the platform is a bad thing. But it feels like we don't talk about the positive impacts at scale

37:18.560 --> 37:22.960
 of these technologies. Can you explain why and is there a way to fix it?

37:23.760 --> 37:29.200
 I don't know if we can fix it. I think we are beings of high neuroticism, for the most part,

37:29.200 --> 37:34.640
 as a personality trait. Not everyone, but most people. And as a compliment to that,

37:34.640 --> 37:39.520
 if someone says 10 nice things about you and one insult, you're more bothered by the insult than

37:39.520 --> 37:44.480
 you're pleased by the nice things, especially if the insult is somewhat true. So you have these

37:45.120 --> 37:49.520
 media, these vehicles, Twitter is one you mentioned, where there's all kinds of messages

37:49.520 --> 37:54.160
 going back and forth. And you're really bugged by the messages you don't like. Most people are

37:54.160 --> 38:00.720
 neurotic to begin with. It's not only taken out on big business to be clear. So Congress catches

38:00.720 --> 38:07.280
 a lot of grief and some of it they deserve, yes. Religion is not attacked the same way,

38:07.280 --> 38:13.840
 but religiosity is declining. If you poll people, the military still polls quite well,

38:14.400 --> 38:18.480
 but people are very disillusioned with many things. And the Martin Gury thesis,

38:18.480 --> 38:22.720
 that because of the internet, you just see more of things. And the more you see of something,

38:22.720 --> 38:26.640
 whether it's good, bad, or in between, the more you will find to complain about,

38:26.640 --> 38:32.800
 I suspect is the fundamental mechanism here. I mean, look at Clubhouse, right? To me,

38:32.800 --> 38:37.280
 it's a great service, may or may not be like my thing, but gives people this opportunity.

38:37.280 --> 38:41.680
 No one makes you go on it. And all these media articles like, oh, is Clubhouse going to wreck

38:41.680 --> 38:45.920
 things? Are they going to break things? New York Times is complaining. Of course,

38:45.920 --> 38:50.720
 it's their competitor as well. I'm like, give these people a chance, talk it up.

38:50.720 --> 38:55.520
 You may or may not like it. Let's praise the people who are getting something done,

38:55.520 --> 39:02.720
 very Einrandian point. As an economic thinker, as a writer, as a podcaster, what do you think about

39:02.720 --> 39:10.640
 Clubhouse? What do you think about? Okay, let me just throw my feeling about it. I used to use

39:10.640 --> 39:15.920
 Discord, which is another service where people use voice. So the only thing you do is just hear

39:15.920 --> 39:22.640
 each other. There's no face. You just see a little icon. That's the essential element of

39:22.640 --> 39:28.640
 Clubhouse. And there's an intimacy to voice only communication that's hard. That didn't make sense

39:28.640 --> 39:33.760
 to me, but it was just what it is, which feels like something that won't last for some reason.

39:33.760 --> 39:41.520
 Maybe it's the cynical view. But what's your sense about the intimacy of what's happening

39:41.520 --> 39:46.640
 right now with Clubhouse? I've greatly enjoyed what I've done, but I'm not sure it's for me

39:46.640 --> 39:53.440
 in the long run for two reasons. First, if you compare it to doing a podcast, podcasting has

39:53.440 --> 40:00.320
 greater reach than Clubhouse. So I would rather put time into my podcast, but then also my core

40:01.600 --> 40:08.080
 asset, so to speak, is I'm a very fast reader. So audio per se is not necessarily to my advantage.

40:08.080 --> 40:13.440
 I don't speak or listen faster than other people. In fact, I'm a slower listener because I like 1.0,

40:13.440 --> 40:18.720
 not 1.5x. So I should spend less time on audio and more time reading and writing.

40:18.720 --> 40:28.480
 Yeah. It's interesting because you mentioned podcasts and audiobooks. The podcasts are recorded,

40:28.480 --> 40:34.800
 and so I can skip things. I can skip commercials or I can skip parts where it's like, this part is

40:34.800 --> 40:42.080
 boring. With live conversations, especially when there's a magic to the fact when you have a lot

40:42.080 --> 40:48.240
 of people participating in that conversation, but some people are like, this topic, they're going

40:48.240 --> 40:53.840
 into this thing and you can't skip it or you can't fast forward, you can't go 1.5x or 2x,

40:53.840 --> 40:59.600
 you can't speed it up. Nevertheless, there's a tension between that. So that's the productivity

40:59.600 --> 41:05.680
 aspect with the actual magic of live communication where anything can happen where

41:05.680 --> 41:13.120
 Elon Musk can ask the CEO of Robinhood, Vlad, about, hey, somebody holding a gun to your head,

41:13.120 --> 41:18.480
 there's something shady going on, the magic of that. That's also my criticism of there's been

41:18.480 --> 41:26.800
 a recent conversation with Bill Gates that he won a platform and had a regular interview on the

41:26.800 --> 41:34.480
 platform without allowing the possibility of the magic of the chaos. So I'm not exactly sure.

41:34.480 --> 41:38.880
 It's probably not the right platform for you and for many other people who are exceptionally

41:38.880 --> 41:43.520
 productive in other places, but there's still nevertheless a magic to the chaos that could

41:43.520 --> 41:49.920
 be created with live conversation that gives me pause. Maybe what it's perfect for is the tribute.

41:49.920 --> 41:53.840
 So they had an episode recently that I didn't hear, but I heard it was wonderful.

41:53.840 --> 41:59.280
 It was anecdotes about Steve Jobs. That you can't do one to one, right? And you don't want control.

41:59.280 --> 42:04.480
 You want different people appearing and stepping up and saying their bit. And Clubhouse is

42:05.280 --> 42:11.920
 110% perfect for that, the tribute. I love that, the tribute. But there's also the possibility,

42:12.480 --> 42:17.440
 I think there was a time when somebody arranged a conversation with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates

42:17.440 --> 42:27.040
 on stage. I remember that happen a long time ago. And it was very formal. It could have

42:27.040 --> 42:31.600
 probably gone better, but it was still magical to have these people that obviously had a bunch

42:31.600 --> 42:38.640
 of tension throughout their history. It's so frictionless to have two major figures

42:39.360 --> 42:43.680
 in world history just jump on on a Clubhouse stage. Putin and Elon Musk.

42:43.680 --> 42:49.440
 Putin and Elon Musk. And that's exactly it. So there's a language barrier there. There's also

42:49.440 --> 42:56.080
 the problem that in particular, Biden would have a similar problem. It's like,

42:56.080 --> 43:01.440
 they're just not into a new technology. So it's very hard to catch the Kremlin up to,

43:01.440 --> 43:06.080
 first of all, Twitter, but to catch them up to Clubhouse, you have to have the,

43:07.120 --> 43:10.720
 Elon Musk has a sense of the internet, the humor, the memes and all that kind of stuff

43:10.720 --> 43:17.280
 that you have to have in order to use a new app and figure out the timing, the beat. What is

43:17.280 --> 43:23.600
 this thing about? So that's the challenge there. But that's exactly it. That magic of have two

43:23.600 --> 43:31.040
 big personalities just show up. And I wonder if it's just the temporary thing that we're going

43:31.040 --> 43:37.280
 through with the pandemic where people are just lonely and they're seeking for that human connection

43:37.280 --> 43:42.320
 that we usually get elsewhere through our work, but they'll stay lonely in my opinion.

43:42.320 --> 43:48.720
 You think so? I do. So it is a pandemic thing, but I think it will persist. And the idea of

43:48.720 --> 43:54.240
 wanting to be connected to more of the world, Clubhouse will still offer that. And all the mental

43:54.240 --> 43:59.920
 health issues out there, a lot of people have broken ties and they will still be lonely post

43:59.920 --> 44:09.680
 vaccines. Yeah, I, from an artificial intelligence perspective, have a sense that there is like a

44:09.680 --> 44:14.160
 deep loneliness in the world that all of us are really lonely. Like we don't even acknowledge

44:14.160 --> 44:19.280
 it. Even people in happy relationships, it feels like there's like an iceberg of loneliness in all

44:19.280 --> 44:26.080
 of us, like seeking to be understood, like deeply understood, understanding us like having somebody

44:26.800 --> 44:32.480
 with whom you can have a deep interaction enough to where you can, they can help you to

44:32.480 --> 44:38.240
 understand yourself. And they also understand you. Like I have a sense that artificial intelligence

44:38.240 --> 44:45.120
 systems can provide that as well. But humans, I think, crave that from other humans in ways that

44:45.120 --> 44:49.280
 we perhaps don't acknowledge. And I have a hope that technology will enable that more and more.

44:49.280 --> 44:54.800
 Like Clubhouse is an example that allows that. Our touring bot is going to outcompete Clubhouse.

44:54.800 --> 45:00.000
 Like why not sort of program your own session? You'll just talk into your device and say,

45:00.000 --> 45:03.760
 here's the kind of conversation I want and it will create the characters for you.

45:03.760 --> 45:08.880
 And it may not be as good as Elon and Vladimir Putin, but he'll be better than ordinary Clubhouse.

45:09.520 --> 45:12.720
 Yeah. And one of the things that's missing, it's not just conversation,

45:13.600 --> 45:19.760
 it's memory. So long term memory is what current AI systems don't have is sharing

45:19.760 --> 45:26.160
 an experience together. Forget the words. It's like sharing the highs and the lows of life together.

45:26.160 --> 45:31.760
 And the systems around us remembering that, remembering we've been through that. Like that's

45:31.760 --> 45:36.960
 the thing that creates really close relationships is going through some shit. Like go struggle.

45:37.520 --> 45:42.640
 If you've survived together, there's something really difficult that bonds you with other humans.

45:42.640 --> 45:45.120
 And this is related to immigration in the American dream.

45:46.320 --> 45:51.040
 In what way? The people who have come to this country, however weird and different they may be,

45:51.680 --> 45:54.960
 they or their ancestors at some point probably have shared this thing.

45:54.960 --> 46:01.600
 Right. U.S. is not going to split up. It may get more screwed up as a country,

46:02.160 --> 46:06.240
 but Texas and California are not going to break off. I mean, they're big enough

46:06.240 --> 46:08.720
 where they could do it, but it's just never going to happen.

46:08.720 --> 46:13.920
 We've been through too much together. That's a hopeful message.

46:13.920 --> 46:18.080
 Do you think, some people have talked to Eric Weinstein, you've talked to Eric Weinstein.

46:18.080 --> 46:27.520
 He has a sense that growth, the entirety of the American system is based on the assumption

46:27.520 --> 46:31.360
 that we're going to grow forever. The economy is going to grow forever. Do you think

46:33.760 --> 46:36.880
 economic growth will continue indefinitely or will we stagnate?

46:38.160 --> 46:44.720
 I've long been in agreement with Eric Peter Thiel, Robert Gordon, and others that growth has slowed

46:44.720 --> 46:51.520
 down. I argued that in my book, The Great Stagnation, appropriately titled, but the last two years,

46:51.520 --> 46:56.240
 I've become much more optimistic. I've seen a lot of breakthroughs in green energy and battery

46:56.240 --> 47:04.160
 technology. mRNA vaccines and medicine is a big deal already. It will repair our GDP and save

47:04.160 --> 47:10.560
 millions of lives around the world. There's an anti malaria vaccine that's now in stage three trial.

47:10.560 --> 47:18.160
 It probably works. CRISPR to defeat sickle cell anemia. Space, area after area after area,

47:18.160 --> 47:22.800
 there's suddenly this surge of breakthroughs. I would say many of them rooted in superior

47:22.800 --> 47:27.680
 computation and ultimately Moore's law and access to those computational abilities.

47:28.400 --> 47:33.920
 I'm much more optimistic than, say, the last time I spoke to Eric. He moves all the time

47:33.920 --> 47:38.400
 in his views. I don't know where he's at now. He hasn't gained. That's really interesting.

47:38.400 --> 47:46.720
 So your little drop of optimism comes from, there might be a fundamental shift in the kind

47:46.720 --> 47:51.920
 of things that computation has unlocked for us in terms of, it could be a wellspring of

47:51.920 --> 47:59.600
 innovation that enables growth for a long time to come. Eric has not quite connected to the

47:59.600 --> 48:04.160
 computation aspect yet to where it could be a wellspring of innovation.

48:04.160 --> 48:07.600
 But you're very close to it in your own work. I don't have to tell you that.

48:07.600 --> 48:11.200
 The work you're doing would not have been possible not very long ago.

48:11.200 --> 48:16.080
 But the question is, how much does that work enable continued growth for decades to come?

48:16.080 --> 48:21.440
 For all their problems, some version of driverless vehicles will be a thing. I'm not sure when,

48:21.440 --> 48:26.640
 you know, much better than I do, maybe only partially, but that too will be a big deal.

48:26.640 --> 48:34.400
 Well, one of the open questions that the Peter Thiel School area of ideas is how much can be

48:34.400 --> 48:40.560
 converted to technology? How many parts of our lives can technology integrate and then innovate?

48:40.560 --> 48:47.760
 Like, can it replace healthcare? Can it replace legal system? Can it replace government? Not

48:47.760 --> 48:58.720
 replace, but make it digital and thereby enable computation to improve it. That's the open question

48:58.720 --> 49:04.640
 because many aspects of our lives are still not really that digitized.

49:05.920 --> 49:10.800
 There was a New York Times symposium in April, which is not long ago, and they asked the so

49:10.800 --> 49:16.560
 called experts, when are we going to get vaccines? And the most optimistic answer was in four years.

49:17.520 --> 49:23.120
 And obviously, we beat that by a long mile. So I think people still haven't woken up. You

49:23.120 --> 49:29.040
 mentioned my tiny drop of optimism, but it's a big drop of optimism. Is it a waterfall yet? I mean,

49:29.040 --> 49:34.320
 is it just... Well, here's my pessimism. Whenever there are major new technologies,

49:34.320 --> 49:39.840
 they also tend to be used for violence directly or indirectly. Radio, Hitler, not that he hit people

49:39.840 --> 49:45.920
 over the head with radios, but it enabled the rise of various dictators. So the new technologies

49:45.920 --> 49:51.520
 now, whatever exactly they may be, they're going to cause a lot of trouble. And that's my pessimism,

49:51.520 --> 49:55.760
 not that I think they're all going to slow to a trickle. When was the stagnation book?

49:56.720 --> 50:04.000
 2011. 2011. Yes. It was the first of these stagnation books, in fact. It's very interesting.

50:04.960 --> 50:10.560
 But even then, I said, this is temporary. And I was predicting it would be gone in about 20 years

50:10.560 --> 50:16.880
 time. I'm not sure that's exactly the right prediction, like 2030, but I think we're actually

50:16.880 --> 50:21.840
 going to beat that. So you think the United States might still be on top of the world for the

50:21.840 --> 50:28.320
 rest of the century in terms of its economic growth, impact on the world, scientific innovation,

50:28.320 --> 50:33.040
 all those kinds of things? That's too long to predict, but I'm bullish on America in general.

50:34.960 --> 50:40.400
 Got it. Speaking of being bullish on America, the opposite of that is...

50:40.400 --> 50:46.640
 We talked about capitalism, we talked about Iran and her Russian roots.

50:48.080 --> 50:58.080
 What do you think about communism? Why doesn't it work? Is it the implementation?

50:58.080 --> 51:04.240
 Is there anything about its ideas that you find compelling, or is it just a fundamentally flawed

51:04.240 --> 51:10.000
 system? Well, communism is like capitalism. The words mean many things to different people.

51:10.640 --> 51:15.600
 You could argue my life as a tenured professor comes closer to communism than anything the human

51:15.600 --> 51:20.800
 race has seen. And I would argue it works pretty well. But look, if you mean the Soviet Union,

51:21.600 --> 51:27.760
 it devolved pretty quickly to a kind of decentralized set of incentives that were

51:27.760 --> 51:34.400
 destructive rather than value maximizing. It wasn't even central planning, much less communism. So

51:34.400 --> 51:38.960
 Paul Craig Roberts and Poignet were correct in their descriptions of the Soviet system.

51:39.520 --> 51:45.360
 Think of it as weird mixes of barter and malfunctioning incentives, and being very good at a whole

51:45.360 --> 51:51.120
 bunch of things, but in terms of progress, innovation, and consumer goods, it really being

51:51.120 --> 51:58.320
 quite a failure. And now I wouldn't call that communism, but that's what I think of the system

51:58.320 --> 52:06.480
 the Soviets had. And it required an ever increasing pile of lies that both alienated people but

52:06.480 --> 52:12.640
 created an elite that by the end of the thing, no longer believed in the system itself, or even

52:12.640 --> 52:17.120
 thought they were doing better by being crooks than by just moving to Switzerland and being

52:17.120 --> 52:21.440
 an upper middle class individual. Like you would have a higher standard of living by Gorbachev's

52:21.440 --> 52:26.560
 time, not Gorbachev, but if you're number 30 in the hierarchy, you're better off as a middle class

52:26.560 --> 52:32.800
 person in Switzerland. And that, of course, did not prove sustainable. And so what is it? A momentum

52:32.800 --> 52:36.800
 of bureaucracy or something like that? It just builds up when you lose control of the original

52:36.800 --> 52:41.840
 vision. And that naturally happens. It's just people. And you can't use normal profit and loss

52:41.840 --> 52:48.080
 in price incentives. So you get all prices, or most prices set too low, shortages everywhere,

52:48.080 --> 52:55.200
 people trade favors, you have this culture of bartered bribes, sexual favors, or family friends.

52:55.200 --> 52:59.760
 And you get more and more of that. And you over time lose more and more of the information and

52:59.760 --> 53:06.560
 the prices and quantities and practices and norms you had. And that slowly decays. And then by the

53:06.560 --> 53:13.280
 end, no one is believing in it. That would be my take. But again, you're the expert here, the

53:13.280 --> 53:21.280
 Russian scholar. Well, perhaps no more an expert than Ayn Rand. It's more personal than it is

53:21.280 --> 53:33.840
 scholarly or historic. So Stalin held power for 30 years. Vladimir Putin has held power for 21

53:33.840 --> 53:39.280
 years. Well, you could argue he took a little break. But not much. He was still holding power,

53:39.280 --> 53:46.000
 I think. And it's still possible now with the new constitution that he could hold power from

53:46.000 --> 53:52.560
 longer than Stalin 30, longer than 30 years. What do you think about the man, the state of affairs

53:52.560 --> 53:59.280
 in Russia? In general, the system they have there, is there something interesting to use

53:59.280 --> 54:04.640
 in economists as a human being about Russia? Everything is interesting. I mean, he would be

54:04.640 --> 54:11.760
 part of my take. As you know, the Russian economy starting what, 1999, 2000, has really quite a

54:11.760 --> 54:18.960
 few years of super excellent growth. And Putin is still riding on that. It more or less coincides

54:18.960 --> 54:25.600
 with his rise as the truly focal figure on the scene. Since then, pretty recently, they've had

54:25.600 --> 54:32.320
 a bunch of years of negative four to five percent growth in a row, which is terrible. The economy

54:32.320 --> 54:39.200
 is way too dependent on fossil fuels. But the structural problem is this. You need a concordance

54:39.200 --> 54:45.280
 across economic power, social power, political power. They don't have to be allocated identically,

54:45.280 --> 54:51.680
 but they have to be allocated consistently. And the Russian system under Putin from almost the

54:51.680 --> 54:58.320
 beginning has never been able to have that, that ultimately, his incentives are to steer the system

54:58.320 --> 55:04.640
 where the economic power is in a small number of hands in a non diversified way. The system won't

55:04.640 --> 55:11.680
 deliver sustainable gains and living standards anymore, ever the way it's set up now, that with

55:11.680 --> 55:18.000
 fossil fuel prices go up, they'll have some good years for sure. And that is really quite structural

55:18.000 --> 55:23.840
 what has gone wrong. And then on top of that, you can have an opinion of Putin, but you've got to

55:23.840 --> 55:29.120
 start with those structural problems. And that's why it's just not going to work. But he had all

55:29.120 --> 55:34.400
 those good years in the beginning. So the number of Russians, say who live here or in Russia,

55:34.400 --> 55:38.480
 who love Putin and it's sincere, they're not just afraid of being dragged away.

55:39.120 --> 55:40.480
 Like that's a real phenomenon.

55:40.480 --> 55:48.240
 Yeah. I'm really torn on Putin's approval rating, real approval rating. It seems to be very high.

55:48.880 --> 55:56.560
 And I'm torn in whether that has to do with the fact that there is control of the press

55:58.000 --> 56:05.040
 or if it's, which is the people I talk to who are in Russia family and so on, a genuine love of

56:05.040 --> 56:10.800
 Putin appreciation of what Putin has done and is going to do with Russia. And a lot of that would

56:10.800 --> 56:16.720
 go away if the press were freer, I think. Yes. Well, Singapore realizes this. Anyone discussed by

56:16.720 --> 56:22.480
 the press, no matter who they are, people in Singapore have done a great job. Yes. But if

56:22.480 --> 56:26.960
 you're discussed by the press, you don't look good. Take company executives are learning this, right?

56:26.960 --> 56:32.800
 It's just like a rule. So in that sense, I think the rating is artificially high, but I don't,

56:32.800 --> 56:39.360
 by any means, think it's all insincere. But that high popularity I view as bearish for Russia,

56:39.360 --> 56:42.320
 I would feel better about the country if people were more pissed off at him.

56:43.040 --> 56:47.040
 Yeah, that's right. It's nice to see free speech, even if it's full of hate.

56:49.600 --> 56:55.520
 I am also troubled on the scientific side and entrepreneurial side. It seems difficult to

56:55.520 --> 57:04.480
 be an entrepreneur in Russia. It's not even in terms of rules. It's just culturally that people

57:04.480 --> 57:14.400
 I speak to, it's not easy to build a business. No, it's not easy to even dream of building a

57:14.400 --> 57:19.280
 business in Russia. That's just not part of the culture, part of the conversation. It's almost

57:19.280 --> 57:26.000
 like the conversation is, if you want to be the next Bill Gates or Elon Musk or Steve Jobs or

57:26.000 --> 57:35.360
 whatever, you come to America. That's the sense they have. History matters. Is history just structural

57:35.360 --> 57:41.040
 problems of today? I mean, it's all the same thing. So a history of hostility to commerce, which of

57:41.040 --> 57:48.960
 course, the old USSR is gone, but a lot of the attitudes remain, a lot of the corruption remains.

57:48.960 --> 57:53.120
 You have this legacy distribution of wealth from the auctioning off of the assets,

57:53.120 --> 57:58.960
 which is not conducive to some kind of broadly egalitarian democracy. So you have these small

57:58.960 --> 58:04.400
 number of power points that try to control information and wealth, and not really so keen

58:04.400 --> 58:09.600
 to encourage the others who ultimately would pull the balance of political power away from the very

58:09.600 --> 58:15.360
 wealthy and from Putin, and they support that culture and the return of interest in Orthodox

58:15.360 --> 58:20.560
 church and all that. It's all part of the same piece, I think, because the old Orthodox church

58:20.560 --> 58:25.520
 is not that pro commerce, you'd have to say, but it's traditionalist. It's pro family. Those are

58:25.520 --> 58:31.440
 safer ideas. And then there's such a great safety valve, the most ambitious, smartest people, like

58:31.440 --> 58:36.960
 they probably will learn English. They can look like they belong in all sorts of other countries

58:36.960 --> 58:41.520
 that can show up and blend in. Super talented. They've probably had an excellent education,

58:41.520 --> 58:47.120
 especially if they're from one of the two major cities, but even if not so, even from Siberia,

58:47.120 --> 58:52.160
 and they go off, they leave, they're not a source of opposition. And that keeps the whole thing

58:52.160 --> 59:00.480
 up and running for another generation. Yeah. What do you make of the other big player, China?

59:01.360 --> 59:10.640
 They seem to have a very different messed up, but also functioning system. They seem to be much

59:10.640 --> 59:16.800
 better at encouraging entrepreneurs. They're choosing winners, but what do you make of the

59:16.800 --> 59:23.680
 entire Chinese system? Why does it work as well as it does currently? What are your concerns about

59:23.680 --> 59:34.160
 it? And what are its threats to the United States or possible? You said wisdom isn't when two ideas

59:34.160 --> 59:39.520
 come together. Is there some possible benefits of these kinds of ideas coming together?

59:39.520 --> 59:45.840
 It's amazing what China has done, but I would say to put it in perspective, if you compare them

59:45.840 --> 59:50.480
 to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, they've still done much worse,

59:51.840 --> 59:58.080
 not even close. And that's both living standards, or I hesitate to cite democracy as

59:58.640 --> 1:00:03.200
 an unalloyed good in and of itself, but there's more freedom in all those other places by a lot.

1:00:03.200 --> 1:00:09.600
 China has all these problems of history, but they've managed, as actually the Soviets did in

1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:14.880
 the middle of the 20th century, one of the two great mass migrations from the countryside to

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:21.200
 cities, which boosts productivity enormously, and will sustain totalitarian systems, but they

1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:28.960
 move from a totalitarian system to an oligarchy, where the CCP is actually at least for a while,

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:34.400
 hey, have been really good at governing, have made a lot of very good decisions. You have to admit

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:42.480
 that. I don't know how long that streak will continue. With one person so much now holding

1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:49.120
 authority in a more extreme manner, the selection pressures for the next generation of high level

1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:54.560
 CCP members probably become much worse. You have this general problem of the state owned

1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:59.520
 enterprise is losing relative productivity compared to the private sector. Well, we're going to kind

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:06.480
 of hold Jack Ma on this island, and he can only issue like weird hello statements. It kind of

1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:14.640
 smells bad to me. I don't feel that it's about to crash, but I don't see them supplanting America

1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:20.720
 as like the world's number one country. I think they will muddle through and have very serious

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:25.440
 problems, but there's enough talent there they will muddle through. Is there ideas from China or

1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:30.320
 from anywhere in general of large scale role of government that you find might be useful?

1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:37.440
 Andrew Yang recently ran on a platform, UBI, Universal Basic Income. Is there

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:50.000
 some interesting ideas of large scale government welfare programs at scale that you find interesting?

1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:57.680
 Well, keep in mind, the current version of the Chinese Communist Party post Mao dismantled

1:01:57.680 --> 1:02:02.160
 what was called the iron rice ball. It took apart the healthcare protections,

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:07.920
 a lot of the welfare system, a lot of the guaranteed jobs. So the economic rise of China coincided

1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:15.840
 with the weakening of welfare. I'm not saying that's causal per se, but people think of China

1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:20.720
 as having a government that takes care of everyone's very far from the truth and buy a lot of metrics.

1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:25.680
 I don't mean control over people's lives. I don't mean speech, but buy a lot of metrics.

1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:30.560
 Economically, we have a lot more government than they do. So what one means here by like

1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:36.080
 government, private control, I don't think you can just add up the numbers and get a simple answer.

1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:42.480
 They've been fantastic at building infrastructure in cities in ways that will attract people from

1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:48.080
 the countryside. And furthermore, they more or less enforce a meritocracy in this sense.

1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:53.920
 Like if you're a kid, if you're a rich guy, you'll get unfair privilege. That's unfair,

1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:58.880
 but systems can afford that. If you are smart and from the countryside and your parents have nothing,

1:02:58.880 --> 1:03:04.480
 you will be elevated and sent to a very good school, graduate school because of the exam system.

1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:09.520
 And they do that, and they mean that very consistently. It's like the Soviets had a

1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:14.880
 version of that, like for chess and romantic piano, not for everything, but where they had it.

1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:18.000
 Like, again, they were tremendous, right? Yeah, exactly.

1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:24.400
 Chinese have it in so many areas, a genuine meritocracy in this one way that moves people

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:30.320
 from the rural to the big city. And that's a big boost of productivity for so amount of time.

1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:34.560
 And when they get there, they're taken seriously. Jack Ma was riding a bicycle teaching English

1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:42.240
 in his late 20s. He was a poor guy. Not a society of credentialism. Or in America,

1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:47.840
 it's way too much a credentialist society. As we were talking about, even with the Nobel Prize.

1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:52.320
 But what do you think about these large government programs like UBI?

1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:58.240
 The one version of UBI that makes the most sense to me is the Mitt Romney version, UBI for kids.

1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:03.520
 Like kids are vulnerable. If their parents screw up, you shouldn't blame the kid or make the kid

1:04:03.520 --> 1:04:10.960
 suffer. I believe in something like UBI for kids, maybe just cash. But if you don't have kids,

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:18.240
 even with AI, my sense is, at least in the world we know, you should be able to find a way to adjust.

1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:25.600
 You might have to move to North Dakota to work next to fracking, say.

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:34.080
 But look, before the pandemic, the two most robot intensive societies, Japan and the US,

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:40.000
 US at least for manufacturing, were at full employment. So maybe there's some far off day

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:45.040
 where there's literally no work. John Lennon and Imagine, it's piped everywhere.

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:51.440
 And then we might revisit the question. But for now, we had rising wages

1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:57.680
 in the Trump years and full employment. You don't see automation as a threat that

1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:01.760
 fundamentally shakes our society. It's a threat in the following sense.

1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:07.040
 The new technologies are harder to work with for many people, and that's a social problem.

1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:12.560
 But I'm not sure a universal basic income is the right answer to that very real problem.

1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:20.240
 Well, that's also, I like the UBI for kids. It's also your definition or the line, the

1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:26.240
 threshold for what is vulnerable and what is basic human nature. Going back to Russia, life is

1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:34.880
 suffering. That struggle is a part of life. And perhaps sort of changing, maybe what defines

1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:40.480
 the 21st century is having multiple careers and adjusting and learning and evolving.

1:05:40.480 --> 1:05:48.080
 And some of the technology in terms of, you know, some of the technology we see,

1:05:48.080 --> 1:05:58.080
 like the internet, allows us to make those pivots easier, allows later life education

1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:03.120
 possible, it makes it possible. I don't know. And your earlier point about loneliness being

1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:08.880
 this fundamental human problem, which I would agree with strongly, UBI, if it's at a high level,

1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:12.560
 will make that worse. I mean, say UBI were higher enough, you could just sit at home.

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:19.120
 People are not going to be happy. They don't actually want that. And we've relearned that

1:06:19.120 --> 1:06:26.160
 in the pandemic. Yeah, the flip side, the hope with UBI is you have a little bit more freedom

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:32.560
 to find the thing that alleviates your loneliness. That's the idea. So it's kind of an open question.

1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:40.640
 If I give you a million dollars, or a billion dollars, will you pursue the thing you love?

1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:47.440
 Will you be more motivated to find the thing you love, to do the thing you love? Or will you be

1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:54.160
 lazy and lose yourself in the sort of daily activities that don't actually bring you joy,

1:06:54.800 --> 1:07:00.880
 but, you know, pacify you in some kind of way where you just let the day slip by?

1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:05.440
 That's an open question. A lot of the great creators did not have huge cushions,

1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:11.040
 whether it was Mozart or James Brown or the great painters in history. They had to work

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:16.800
 pretty hard. And if you look at heirs to great fortunes, maybe I'm forgetting someone, but

1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:23.440
 it's hard to think of any who have creatively been important as novelists or they might have

1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:29.920
 continued to run the family business. But Van Gogh was not heirs, not heir to a great family fortune.

1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:38.320
 It's sad that cushions get in the way of progress. It's the same point about prizes,

1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:41.680
 right? Yeah, inheriting too much money is like winning a prize.

1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:48.480
 We mentioned Eric Weinstein. I know you agree on a bunch of things. Is there some beautiful,

1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:52.960
 fascinating insights for disagreement that you have? Does he have to be resolved with him?

1:07:53.920 --> 1:07:59.520
 Is there some ideas that you guys battle it out on? Is it the stagnation question that you've

1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:06.880
 mentioned? That's one of them, but here's at least two others. But I would stress Eric is

1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:11.760
 always evolving. So I'm just talking about a time slice, Eric, right? I don't know where he's at

1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:16.320
 right now. Like I heard him on Clubhouse three nights ago, but that was three nights ago.

1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:22.640
 But I think he's far too pessimistic about the impact of immigration on US science.

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:29.200
 He thinks it has displaced US scientists, which I think that is partly true. I just think we've

1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:35.600
 gotten better talent. I'm like, bring it on, double down, and look at Kurt Eco, who basically came

1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:41.600
 up with mRNA vaccines. She was from Hungary and was ridiculed and mocked. She couldn't get her

1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:48.240
 papers published. She stuck at it. An American might not have been so stubborn because we have

1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:53.520
 these cushions. So Eric is all worried, like mathematicians coming in, they're discouraging

1:08:53.520 --> 1:09:00.240
 native US citizens from doing math. I'm like, bring in the best people. If we all end up

1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:06.000
 in other avocations, absolutely fine by me. Does it trouble you that we kick them out

1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:12.400
 after they get a degree often? I would give anyone with a plausible graduate degree a green card,

1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:18.880
 universally. Yeah. I agree with that. It makes no sense. It makes so strange that the best people

1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:23.760
 that come here suffer here, create awesome stuff here. Then when we kick them out, it doesn't make

1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:29.840
 any sense. Here's another view I have. I call it open borders for Belarus. Now, Russia is a big

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:38.240
 country. I would gladly increase the Russian quota by 3x, 4x, 5x. Not 20%, but a big boost.

1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:45.760
 But Belarus, a small country, they're poor and they have decent education

1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:51.920
 and a lot of talent there. Why can't we just open the door and convert a Belarus passport

1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:55.920
 to a green card? Open borders for Belarus. It's my new campaign slogan.

1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:00.000
 Are you running for president in 2024? Well, writings are welcome.

1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:04.080
 What's the second thing you disagree with, Eric?

1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:14.000
 Trade. Again, I'm not sure where he's at now, but he is suspicious of trade in a way that I am not.

1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:18.800
 I do understand what's called the China shock has been a big problem for the US

1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:22.960
 middle class. I fully accept that. I think most of that is behind us.

1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:28.800
 National security issues aside, I think free trade is very much a good thing.

1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:34.240
 Eric, I'm not sure he'll say it's not a good thing, but he won't say it is a good thing.

1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:42.080
 Eric, free trade. But look, on things like vaccines, I don't believe in free trade.

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:45.440
 Why? You want vaccine production in your own country.

1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:49.040
 Look at the EU. They have enough money. No one will send them vaccines.

1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:54.560
 What's different about vaccines? There's some things you want to prioritize the

1:10:54.560 --> 1:11:01.120
 citizenry on. You could argue it would be cheaper to produce all US manufactured vaccines in India.

1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:07.200
 They have the technologies, obviously lower wages, but look, there's talk in India right

1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:12.160
 now of cutting off the export of vaccines. If you outsource your vaccine production, you're not

1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:17.920
 sure the other country will respect the norm of free trade. You need to keep some vaccine

1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:25.440
 production in your country. It's an exception to free trade, not to the logic a bunch of things

1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:32.000
 the Navy uses. You can't buy those components from China. That's insane. But look, it would

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:38.560
 be cheaper to do so, right? Yeah. Let me completely shift topics on something that's fascinating.

1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:42.560
 It's all the same topic, but great. Everything is interesting.

1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:55.280
 What do you think about what the hell is money? The recent excitement around cryptocurrency

1:11:55.280 --> 1:12:05.120
 that brings to the forefront, the philosophical discussion of the nature of money. Are you

1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:09.440
 bullish on cryptocurrency? Are you excited about it? What does it make you think about

1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:15.360
 how the nature of money is changing? No one knows what money is. Probably no one ever knew.

1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:20.720
 Go back to medieval times, bills of exchange. Were they money? Maybe it's just a semantic

1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:26.240
 debate. Gold, silver, what about copper coins? What about metals that were considered legal tender

1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:33.360
 but not always circulating? What about credit? Being confused about money is the natural state

1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:37.680
 of affairs for human beings. If there's more of that, I'd say that's probably a good thing.

1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:44.480
 Crypto, per se, I think Bitcoin has taken over a lot of the space held by gold.

1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:51.120
 That, to me, seems sustainable. I'm not short Bitcoin. I don't have some

1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:56.560
 view that the price has to be different than the current price, but I know it changes every moment.

1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:04.640
 I am deeply uncertain about the less of crypto, which seems connected to ultimate visions of

1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:12.000
 using it for transactions in ways where I'm not sure whether it be prediction markets or DeFi.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:18.240
 I'm not sure the retail demand really is there once it is regulated like everything else is.

1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:25.520
 I would say I'm 4060 optimistic on those forms of crypto. That is, I think it's somewhat more

1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:31.040
 likely they fail than succeed, but I take them very seriously. We're talking about it becoming

1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:34.720
 one of the main currencies in the world. That's what we're discussing. That I don't think will

1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:42.800
 happen. The reality is that Bitcoin used to be in the single digits of a dollar and now has

1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:49.360
 crossed $50,000 for a single Bitcoin. Do you think it's possible it reaches something like a million

1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:55.200
 dollars? I don't think we have a good theory of the value of Bitcoin. If people decide it's worth

1:13:55.200 --> 1:14:00.000
 a million dollars, it's worth a million dollars. Isn't that money? Like you said, isn't the ultimate

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:05.120
 state of money confusion, however beautifully you put it? It's like valuing an Andy Warhol painting.

1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:10.480
 When Warhol started off, probably those things had no value, the early sketches of shoes.

1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:17.440
 Now a good Warhol could be worth over $50 million. That's an incredible rate of price appreciation.

1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:22.560
 Bitcoin is seeing a similar trajectory. I don't pretend to know where it will stop,

1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:27.440
 but it's about trying to figure out what did people think of Andy Warhol. He could be out of

1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:34.960
 fashion in a century, maybe yes, maybe no, but you don't think about Warhols as money.

1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:40.480
 They perform some money like functions. You can even use them as collateral

1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:48.240
 for deals between gangs, but they're not basically money nor is Bitcoin. The transactions velocity

1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:52.320
 of Bitcoin I would think is likely to fall, if anything. You don't think there will be some

1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:59.120
 kind of phase shift, will it become adopted, become mainstream for one of the main mechanisms

1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:04.640
 of transactions? Bitcoin, no. Ether has some chance at that. I would bet against it,

1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:11.600
 but I wouldn't give you a definitive no. Bitcoin is too costly. It may be fine to hold it like

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:18.720
 gold, but gold is also costly. You have smart people trying to make, say, Ether much more

1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:25.360
 effective as a currency than Bitcoin, and there's certainly a decent chance they will succeed.

1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:30.880
 Yeah, there's a lot of innovation. It was smart contracts with NFTs as well. There's a lot of

1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:36.960
 interesting innovations that are plugging into the human psyche somehow, just like money does.

1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:45.200
 Money seems to be this viral thing, our ideas of money. If the idea is strong enough,

1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:49.680
 it seems to be able to take hold. There's network effects that just take over.

1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:58.560
 I particularly see that with, I'd love to get your comment on Dogecoin, which is basically by

1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:04.960
 a single human being Elon Musk has been created. It's like these celebrities can have a huge ripple

1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:12.720
 effect on the impact of money. Is it possible that in the 21st century, people like Elon Musk

1:16:12.720 --> 1:16:21.520
 and celebrities, Donald Trump, the Rock, whoever else, can actually define the currencies that

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:25.680
 we use? Can Dogecoin be kind of the primary currency of the world?

1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:31.840
 I think of it as like baseball cards. Right now, every baseball player has a baseball card.

1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:36.320
 The players who are stars, their cards can end up worth a fair amount of money.

1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:43.520
 That's stable. We've had it for many decades. The player defines the card. They sign a contract

1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:50.000
 with Tops or whatever company. Could you imagine celebrities, baseball players, LeBron James,

1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.520
 having their own currencies instead of cards? Absolutely. You're somewhat seeing that right

1:16:55.520 --> 1:17:01.440
 now, as you mentioned, artists with these unique works on the blockchain. But I'm not sure those

1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:06.640
 are macroeconomically important. If it's just a new class of collectibles that people have fun with,

1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:13.280
 again, I say bring it on. But whether there are use cases beyond that that challenge fiat

1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:20.640
 monies, which actually work very well. Yesterday, I sent money to a family in Ethiopia that I

1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:24.160
 helped support. In less than 24 hours, they got that money.

1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:31.680
 Digitally, yes. No, not digitally, through my bank. My primitive dinosaur bank, BB&T,

1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:37.920
 Mid Atlantic Bank, had quartered in North Carolina, charted by the Fed, regulated by the FDAC and

1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:46.080
 the OCC. Now, you could say, well, the exchange rate was not so great. I don't see crypto as

1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:50.000
 close to beating that once you take into account all of the last mile problems.

1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:55.920
 Fiat currency works really well. People are not sitting around bitching about it. And when you

1:17:55.920 --> 1:17:59.920
 talk to crypto people, the number who have to postulate some out of the blue hyperinflation,

1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:05.840
 where there's no evidence for that whatsoever, that's Denise assigned, they're not thinking clearly

1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:08.880
 about how hard they have to work to outcompete fiat currency.

1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:15.120
 There's a bunch of different technologies that are really exciting that don't want to address

1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:20.400
 how difficult it is to outcompete the current accepted alternative. So for example, autonomous

1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:28.960
 vehicles, a lot of people are really excited, but it's not trivial to outcompete Uber on the cost

1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:34.640
 and the effectiveness and the user experience and all those kinds of, sorry, Uber driven by humans.

1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:42.400
 And it's not, that's taken for granted, I think, that look, wouldn't it be amazing how amazing

1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:46.800
 would the world look when the cars are driving themselves fully? It's going to drive the cost

1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:51.280
 down, you can remove the cost of drivers, all those kinds of things. But when you actually get

1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:55.760
 down to it and have to build a business around it, it's actually very difficult to do. And I guess

1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:02.400
 you're saying your sense is similar competition is facing cryptocurrency. You have to actually

1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:12.800
 present a killer app reason to switch from fiat currency to Ethereum or whatever.

1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:17.600
 And the Biden people are going to regulate crypto and they're going to do it soon. So something like

1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:23.760
 DeFi, I fully get why that is cheaper or for some can be cheaper than other ways of conducting

1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:29.280
 financial intermediation. But some of that is regulatory arbitrage. It will not be allowed

1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:35.280
 to go on forever for better or worse. I would rather see it given greater tolerance. But the

1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:40.560
 point is banking lobby is strong. The government will only let it run so far. There'll be capital

1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:45.120
 requirements, reporting requirements imposed, and it will lose a lot of those advantages.

1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:52.320
 What do you make of Wall Street bets? Another thing that recently happened that shook the world

1:19:52.320 --> 1:19:59.200
 and at least me from the outside of perspective, make me question what I do and don't understand

1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:06.640
 about economics, which is a large number of individuals getting together on the internet

1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:12.240
 and having a large scale impact on the markets. If you tell a group of people and coordinate

1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:15.840
 them through the internet, we're going to play a fun game that might cost you money,

1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:19.440
 but you're going to make the headlines and there's a chance you'll screw over some billionaires

1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:24.560
 and hedge funds. Enough people will play that game. That game might continue, but I don't

1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:30.560
 think it's of macroeconomic importance. The price of those stocks in the medium term

1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:36.080
 will end up wherever it ought to be. These are little outliers from a macroeconomics

1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:45.920
 perspective. These are not signals of shifting power, like from centralized power to distributed

1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:50.080
 power. These aren't some fundamental changes in the way our economy works.

1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:53.920
 I think of it as a new brand of eSports, maybe more fun than the old brand,

1:20:55.040 --> 1:21:00.000
 which is fine. It's like push the anarchy into the corners where you want it. It doesn't

1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:06.560
 bother me, but I think people are seeing it as more fun amount than it is. It's a new eSport,

1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:12.560
 more fun for many, but more expensive than the old eSports. Like chess is a new eSport,

1:21:12.560 --> 1:21:18.880
 super cheap. Not as fun as sending hedge funds to their doom, but what would you expect?

1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:24.800
 The poacher that I love it. Okay. But macroeconomically, it's not fundamental.

1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:30.000
 Okay. I was going to say, I hope you're right because I'm uncomfortable with the chaos of the

1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:37.920
 masses that's creates. I think that chaos is somewhat real to be clear, but it will matter

1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:47.200
 through other channels, not through manipulating GameStop or AMC. So you're seeing the real

1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:52.400
 macro phenomenon. When people see a real macro phenomenon, they tend to make every micro story

1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:56.960
 fit the narrative. And this micro story, like it fits the narrative, but it doesn't mean its

1:21:56.960 --> 1:22:02.320
 importance fits the narrative. That's how I would kind of dissect the mistake I think people are

1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:08.960
 making. Then the macro phenomenon, there are there, do you mean... Everyone's weird now.

1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:13.520
 The internet either allows us to be weirder or makes us weirder. I'm not sure what's

1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:18.240
 the right way to put it. Maybe a mix of both. You're probably right that it allows us to be

1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:25.520
 weirder because this connects our previous conversation. Does America allow us to be

1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:31.440
 weirder or does it make us weirder? Like say we're weird and somewhat neurotic to begin with.

1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:36.880
 But the only messages we get are Dwight D. Eisenhower and I Love Lucy and Network TV.

1:22:37.440 --> 1:22:42.480
 Like that's going to keep us within certain bounds in good and bad ways. That's obviously

1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:48.080
 totally gone. And the internet, you can connect to not just QAnon, but all sorts of things. Many

1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:55.200
 of them just fantastic, right? But in good and bad ways, it makes us weirder. So that maybe is

1:22:55.200 --> 1:22:59.440
 troubling, right? Like if someone's worried about that, I would at least say they should

1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:06.160
 give it deep serious thought. And then it has a whole lot of ebbs and flows, micro realizations

1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:11.520
 of the weirdness that don't actually matter. So like chess players today, they play a lot

1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:16.880
 more weird openings than they did 20 years ago. Like it reflects the same thing. Because you

1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:22.640
 can research any weird opening on the internet. But like, does that matter? Probably not. So a

1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:27.120
 lot of the things we see are just like the weird chess openings. And to figure out which are like

1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:31.760
 the weird chess openings and which are fundamental to the new and growing weirdness. Like that's

1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:37.120
 what a hedge fund investor type should be trying to do. I just think no one knows yet. It's like

1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:41.600
 this itself, this fun weird guessing game, which we're partly engaging in right now.

1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:49.440
 Exactly. And I mean, as Eric talks about on the science side of things, I mean, I said like at

1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:54.880
 MIT, especially in the machine learning field, there's a natural institutional resistance to

1:23:54.880 --> 1:24:00.800
 the weird. It's very, as they talk about, it's difficult to hire weird faculty, for example.

1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:07.520
 Correct. You want to hire, you want to hire and give tenure to people that are safe, not weird.

1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:11.840
 And that's one of the concerns is like, it seems like the weird people are the ones that push the

1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:17.680
 science forward usually. Right. And so like, how do you, how do you balance it to, it's not obvious.

1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:23.280
 Because another area where Eric and I disagree, as I interpret him, he thinks academia is totally

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:29.520
 bankrupt. And I think it's only partially bankrupt. How do we fix it? Because I'm with

1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:35.360
 you. I'm bullish on academia. You need up and coming schools that end up better than where

1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:41.120
 they started off. And MIT was once one of them. Now they're not in every area. In some areas,

1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:45.120
 they have become the problem. You Chicago, you wouldn't call it up and coming,

1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:49.440
 but it's still different. And that's great. Let's hope they manage to keep it that way.

1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:57.040
 The biggest problem to me is the rank absurd conformism at kind of second tier schools,

1:24:57.040 --> 1:25:02.480
 maybe in the top 40, but not in the top dozen, that are just trying to be like a junior MIT,

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:07.600
 but it's mediocre and copycat. And they're the most dogmatic enforcers of weirdness that like

1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:12.640
 Harvard is more open than those second tier schools. And those second tier schools are

1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:16.720
 pretty good, typically, right? Yeah. But the mediocrity is enforced there.

1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:22.960
 Correct. Very strictly. And the homogenization pressure is trying to climb their rankings by

1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:27.680
 another three places and be a little closer to MIT though you'll never touch them. That to me is

1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:33.360
 very harmful. And you'd rather they be more like Chicago, more like Caltech, or the older Caltech

1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:39.760
 all the more like pick some model, be weird in it. You might fail. That's socially better.

1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:48.240
 Yeah. But so the problem with MIT, for example, is the mediocrity is really enforced on the

1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:53.440
 junior faculty. Yeah. So the people that are allowed to be weird, or actually they just don't

1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:57.680
 even ask for permissions anymore, are more senior faculty. And that's good, of course,

1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:06.160
 but you want the weird young people. I find to this podcast, I like talking to tech people

1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:11.040
 and I find the young faculty to be really boring. They are. They're the most boring of faculty.

1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:18.800
 Their work is interesting technically, technically, but just the passion. They are dredges.

1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:26.560
 And some of them sneak by. Like you have like the young version of Max Tegmark who

1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:34.160
 knows how to play the role of boring and fitting in. And then on the side, he does the weird shit.

1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:40.800
 But they're not, they're far and few in between, which I'd love to figure out a way to shake up

1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:46.080
 the system because. If you look at MIT's Broad Institute, right, in biomedical, it's been a

1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:52.640
 huge hit. Yeah. I'm not privy to their internal doings, but I suspect they support weird more

1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:56.960
 than the formal departments do at the junior level. Yes, that's probably true. Yeah, I don't know

1:26:56.960 --> 1:27:04.480
 what whatever they're doing is working, but it needs to figure it out because I think the best

1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:11.520
 ideas still do come from the, so forget my apologies, but for the humanity side of things,

1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:16.880
 I don't know anything, Bob, but the engineering and the science side, I think there's so many

1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:20.640
 amazing ideas that are still coming from universities. It's not true that you don't

1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:24.960
 know anything about the humanities. You're doing the humanities right now. We're talking about

1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:30.480
 people. There are no numbers put on a blackboard, right? There's no hypothesis testing per se. No,

1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:36.080
 yeah. You have however many subscribers to your podcast, all listening to you on the humanities,

1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:41.360
 every whatever your frequency is. But I'm not in the department of the humanities. That's why

1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:47.280
 it's innovative. They have very different conversations. There's the number of emails I get

1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:56.240
 about, listen, I really deeply respect diversity and the full scope of what diversity means and

1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:00.080
 also the more narrow scope of different races and genders and so on. It's a really important

1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:05.840
 topic, but there's a disproportionate number of emails I'm getting about meetings and discussions

1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:11.680
 and that just kind of overwhelming. I don't get enough emails from people like a meeting about

1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:21.680
 why are all your ideas bad? For example, let me call out MIT. Why don't we do more? Why don't we

1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:27.120
 kick Stanford's ass or Google's ass more importantly in deep learning and machine learning and AI

1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:33.440
 research? What CCL for example used to be a laboratory is a laboratory for artificial

1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:43.600
 intelligence research. Why is that not the beacon of greatness in artificial intelligence?

1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:48.960
 Let's have those meetings as well. Diversity talk has oddly become this new mechanism for

1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:54.880
 enforcing conformity. Yes, exactly. Right. So it's almost like this conformity mechanism finds

1:28:54.880 --> 1:29:01.920
 the hot new topic to use to enforce further conformity. Exactly. Boy, I still hope I'm

1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:06.880
 made optimistic. The humanities have innovated through podcasts, including yours and mine.

1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:13.680
 And they're alive and well. All the bad talk you hear about the humanities in universities,

1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:17.520
 there's been this huge end run of innovation on the internet and it's amazing.

1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:23.040
 You're right. I never thought, I mean, this is humanities. This podcast.

1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:25.920
 It's like I've been speaking prose all one's life and didn't know it, right?

1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:33.280
 Yeah. I am actually part of the humanities department at MIT now. I did not realize this

1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:37.520
 and I will fully embrace it from this moment on. Look, you have this thing, the media lab.

1:29:37.520 --> 1:29:41.680
 I'm sure you know about it. Done some excellent things, done a lot of very bogus things,

1:29:42.320 --> 1:29:46.800
 but you're out competing them. You're blowing them out of the water. Yeah. Like you are them.

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:51.600
 Yeah. I mean, I'm talking to those folks and they're trying to figure it out. I mean,

1:29:51.600 --> 1:29:58.880
 they had their issues with Jeff Epstein and so on, but outside of that, there's a, I actually

1:29:58.880 --> 1:30:06.480
 gone through a shift with this particular podcast, for example, where at first it was seen as one,

1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:12.800
 very first it was seen as a distraction. Second, it was a source of like almost like a kind of

1:30:12.800 --> 1:30:18.160
 jealousy, like the same kind of jealousy you feel when junior faculty outshines the senior faculty.

1:30:18.160 --> 1:30:23.680
 Of course. And now it's more like, oh, okay, this is a thing. We should do more of that.

1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:29.440
 We should embrace this guy. We should embrace this thing. So there's a sense that podcasting

1:30:29.440 --> 1:30:34.880
 and whatever this is, and it's just not the podcasting, will drive some innovation within

1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:39.840
 MIT, within different universities. There's a sense that things are changing. It's just that

1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:47.680
 university is lagged behind. And my hope is that they catch up quickly. They innovate in

1:30:47.680 --> 1:30:52.800
 some way that goes along with the innovations of the internet. I think the internet will

1:30:52.800 --> 1:30:58.080
 outrace them for a long time, maybe forever. Well, I mean, but it's okay if they're, as long as they

1:30:58.080 --> 1:31:02.640
 keep them. Yeah. And we're both in universities. So we have multiple hats on here, as we're speaking.

1:31:02.640 --> 1:31:08.320
 So we can complain about the university, but that's like complaining about the podcasting, right?

1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:16.320
 Yeah. We be them. But speaking on the weird, you've, in the best sense of the word weird,

1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:21.280
 you've written about and made the case that we should take UFO sightings more seriously.

1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:32.960
 So that's one of the things that I've been inundated with, sort of the excitement and the

1:31:32.960 --> 1:31:40.000
 passion that people have for the possibility of extraterrestrial life, of life out there in

1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.160
 the universe. I've always felt this excitement of just looking up at the stars and wondering what

1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:51.680
 the hell's out there. But there's people that have more like, more grounded excitement and

1:31:51.680 --> 1:31:58.640
 passion of actually interacting with the, with aliens on this here, our planet. What's the case

1:31:59.600 --> 1:32:04.800
 they, from your perspective for taking these sightings more seriously?

1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:13.840
 The data from the Navy to me seem quite serious. I don't pretend that I have the technical

1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:20.480
 abilities to judge it as data, but there are numerous senators at the very highest of levels,

1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:25.280
 former heads of CIA. Brennan, I talked to him, did an interview with him.

1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:29.680
 I asked him, what's up with these? What do you think it is? He basically said that was the

1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:34.320
 single most likely explanation was of alien origin. Now you don't have to agree with him.

1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:39.600
 But look, if you know how government works, these senators or Hillary Clinton, for that matter,

1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:44.880
 or Brennan, they sat down, they were briefed by their smartest people and they said, hey,

1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:50.160
 what's going on here? And everyone around the table, I believe is telling them, we don't know.

1:32:51.120 --> 1:32:57.920
 And that is sociological data. I take very seriously, I have not seen a debunking of the

1:32:57.920 --> 1:33:03.680
 technical data, which is eyewitness reports and images and radar. Again, at a technical level,

1:33:03.680 --> 1:33:10.800
 I feel quite uncertain on that turf, but evaluating the testimony of witnesses, it seems to me it's

1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:18.400
 now at a threshold where one ought to take it seriously. One of the problems with UFO sightings

1:33:18.400 --> 1:33:24.240
 is that because of people with good equipment, don't take it seriously. It's such a taboo topic

1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:31.040
 that you have just like really shitty equipment collecting data. And so you have the blurry,

1:33:31.040 --> 1:33:34.800
 bigfoot kind of situation where you have just bad video and all those kinds of things.

1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:44.240
 As opposed to, I mean, there's a bunch of people, Avi Lo from Harvard talking about Amua Mua,

1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:53.440
 it's just like people with the equipment to do the data collection don't want to help out.

1:33:53.440 --> 1:34:00.240
 And that creates a kind of divide where the scientists ignore that this is happening and

1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:04.880
 there's the masses of people who are curious about it. And then there's the government that's

1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:12.080
 full of secrets that's leaking some confusion. And it creates distrust in the government,

1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:17.520
 it creates distrust in science. And it prevents the scientists from being able to explore some

1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:24.560
 cool topics, some exciting possibilities that they should be, be curious kids like Avi talks about.

1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:29.600
 Even if it has nothing to do with aliens, whatever the answer is, it has to be something

1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:32.960
 fascinating. We already know everything's interesting, but this is fascinating.

1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:39.360
 But look, that all said, I suspect they're not of alien origin. And let's let me tell you my

1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:45.280
 reason. The people who are all gung ho, they do a kind of reasoning in reverse or argument from

1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:51.520
 elimination. They figure out a bunch of things that can't be like, is it a Russian advanced vehicle?

1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:56.480
 No, probably pretty good arguments there. Is it a Chinese advanced vehicle? No.

1:34:57.200 --> 1:35:03.440
 Is it people like from the Earth's future coming back in time? No. And they go through a few others,

1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:06.880
 they have some really good no arguments, and they're like, well, what we've got left is aliens.

1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:13.520
 This argument from elimination, I don't actually find that persuasive. You can talk yourself into

1:35:13.520 --> 1:35:18.080
 a lot of mistaken ideas that way. Yeah. The positive evidence that it's aliens

1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:23.280
 is still quite weak. The positive evidence that it's a puzzle is quite huge.

1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:28.320
 And whatever the solutions to the puzzle is, it might be fascinating.

1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:32.480
 And it's going to be so weird or fascinating, or maybe even trivial, but that's weird in its own

1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:38.640
 way, that we can't set up by elimination all the things that might be able to be.

1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:44.000
 Yeah. And just like you said, the debunking that I've seen of these kinds of things are

1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:52.160
 less explorations and solutions to the puzzle and more a kind of half hearted dismissal.

1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:58.080
 And Avi, as you mentioned to him on your podcast with him, he's been attacked an awful lot.

1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:02.880
 And when I hear the idea carrier attacked, I get very suspicious of the critics.

1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:07.120
 Yeah. If he's wrong, just tell me why. Yeah.

1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:13.920
 Like my ears are open. I don't have a set view on Oumuamua. I know I can't judge Avi's

1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:18.960
 arguments. He can't convince me in that sense. I'm too stupid to understand how good his argument

1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:27.920
 may or may not be. And like you said, ultimately, in the argument, in the meeting of that debate

1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:32.560
 is where we find the wisdom, like dismissing it. That's one of the things that troubles me.

1:36:32.560 --> 1:36:35.440
 There's a bunch of people like Nietzsche sometimes dismissed this way.

1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:41.680
 Ayn Rand is sometimes dismissed this way. Oh, here we go. Like there's as opposed to arguing

1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:48.880
 against her ideas, dismissing it outright. And that's not productive at all. She may be wrong

1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:54.480
 in a lot of things, but like laying out some arguments, even if they're basic human arguments,

1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:58.480
 that's where we arrive at the wisdom. I love that.

1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:06.640
 Is there something deeper to be said about our trust in institutions and governments and so on

1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:13.040
 that has to do with UFOs? That there's a kind of suspicion that the US government and governments

1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:16.960
 in general are hiding stuff from us when you talk about UFOs?

1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:22.800
 This is my view on that. If we declassified everything, I think we would find a lot more

1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:28.160
 evidence all pointing toward the same puzzle. There aren't some alien men being held underground.

1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:33.520
 There's not some secret file that lays out whatever is happening. I think the real lesson

1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:40.240
 about government is government cannot bring itself to any new belief on this matter of any

1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:45.760
 kind. And it's a kind of funny inertia. Government is deeply puzzled. They're more puzzled than

1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:51.120
 they want to admit to us, which like, I'm okay with that actually. They shouldn't just be out

1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:56.320
 panicking people in the streets. But at the end of the day, it's a bit like approving the AstraZeneca

1:37:56.320 --> 1:38:01.920
 vaccine, which does work and they haven't approved it. When are they going to do it? When is our

1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:09.120
 government actually, if only internally, going to take this more than just seriously, but take

1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:15.280
 it truly seriously? And I just don't know if we have that capability kind of mentally to sound

1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:22.880
 like Eric Weinstein for another moment. To stay on the same topic, although on the surface shifting

1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:30.640
 completely, because it is all the same topic, you have written and studied art. What do you think we

1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:37.040
 humans long to create art? Human society in general and just the human mind?

1:38:37.840 --> 1:38:42.640
 Well, most of us don't really long to create art, right? I would start with that point.

1:38:43.680 --> 1:38:49.760
 You think so? You think that's a unique weirdness of some particular humans?

1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:57.280
 I think, I don't know, 10% of humans, roughly, which is a lot. But it is somewhat weird. I don't

1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:03.360
 aspire to create art. You could say, writing nonfiction, there's something art like about it,

1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:12.160
 but it's a different urge, I would say. So why do some people have it? I think human brains are

1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:17.600
 very different. It's a different notion of working through a problem, like you and I

1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:23.520
 enjoy working through analytic problems. For me, economics for UAI and other areas or your

1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:31.040
 humanity's podcast, but that's fun. For that problem to be visual and linked to physical

1:39:31.040 --> 1:39:38.640
 materials and putting those on a canvas, to me, it's not a huge leap. But I really don't want to

1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:49.040
 do it. If you paid me 500 bucks to spend an hour painting, I don't know. Is that worth it? Maybe,

1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:55.920
 but I'm happy when that hour's over. And would not be proud or happy with the results?

1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:59.040
 It would suck. I don't think I would do it, actually.

1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:06.640
 Do you think you're suppressing some deep... Absolutely not. Now, when I was young, I played

1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:10.640
 the guitar as you played the guitar, and that I greatly enjoyed, although I was never good.

1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:16.160
 But it helped me appreciate music much, much more. Well, this is the question. Okay, so from the

1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:22.560
 perspective of the observer and appreciator of art, you said good. Is there such a concept as good

1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:28.160
 in art? There's clearly a concept of bad. My guitar playing fit that concept.

1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:33.120
 Okay. But I wasn't trying to be good. I wanted to learn how to chords work,

1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:38.560
 how does a jazz improvisation work, how is blues different, classical guitar,

1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:42.240
 sort of physically, how do you make those sounds? Yes. And I did learn those things,

1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:46.320
 and you can't learn everything about them, but you couldn't learn a lot about them without ever

1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:49.760
 being good or even trying to be that good. But I could play all the notes.

1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:56.880
 So from the observer perspective, what do you... I apologize for the absurd question,

1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:02.320
 but what do you use the most beautiful and maybe a moving piece of art you've encountered in your

1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:09.680
 life? It's not an absurd question at all. And I think about this quite a bit. I would say

1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:16.720
 the two winners by a clear margin are both by Michelangelo. It's the Pieta in the Vatican

1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:25.200
 and the David statue in Florence. Why? Historical context or just purity, the creation itself?

1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:28.960
 I don't think you can view it apart from historical context and being in Florence

1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:34.400
 or in the Vatican. You're already primed for a lot, right? You can't pull that out.

1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:42.000
 But just technically, how they express the emotion of human form, I do honestly intellectually think

1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:47.280
 they're the two greatest artworks for doing that. That's not all that art does. Not all art is about

1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:54.160
 the human form, but they are phenomenal. And I think critical opinion, not that everyone agrees,

1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:59.280
 but my view is not considered a crazy one within the broader court of critical opinion. Now,

1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:05.680
 in painting, I think the most I was ever blown away was to see Vermeer's artwork. It's called

1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:12.080
 the Art of Painting and it's in Vienna in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. And I saw that, I think

1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:18.960
 I was 23. It just stunned me because I'd seen reproductions, but live in front of you and

1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:25.760
 huge, a completely different artwork. And again, Vienna primed. Yes. And I was living abroad for

1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:30.720
 the first time in Vienna itself, the city and so on. Now, unlike the Michelangeloes, that is not my

1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:36.160
 current favorite painting, but that would be like historically the one I would pick. What do you make

1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:43.280
 in the context of those choices? What do you make of modern art? And I apologize if I'm not using

1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:51.760
 the correct terminology, but art that maybe is goes another level of weird outside of the art

1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:56.800
 that you've kind of mentioned and breaks all the conventions and rules and so on and becomes

1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:03.760
 something else entirely that doesn't make sense in the same way that David might.

1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:08.320
 I think a lot of it is phenomenal. And I would say the single biggest mistake that really smart

1:43:08.320 --> 1:43:14.720
 people make is to think contemporary art or music, for that matter, is just a load of junk

1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:19.760
 or rubbish. It's just like a kind of mathematics they haven't learned yet. It's really hard to learn.

1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:26.320
 Maybe some people can never learn it. But there's a very large community of super smart, well

1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:30.960
 educated people who spend their lives with it, who love it. Those are genuine pleasures. They

1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:35.120
 understand it. They talk about it with the common language. And to think that somehow

1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:40.240
 they're all frauds, it just isn't true. Like one doesn't have to like it oneself, just like

1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:45.680
 love house may or may not be your thing. But it is amazing. And for me personally, highly rewarding.

1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:50.800
 And if someone doesn't get it, I do kind of have the conceited response of thinking like in that

1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:56.720
 area, I'm just smarter than you are. Yeah. So the interesting thing is as with most,

1:43:56.720 --> 1:44:01.520
 we get back to Eric Weinstein again. Yes. Who is in general smarter than I am. This I get.

1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:06.080
 But when it comes to contemporary artistic creations, I'm smarter than he is.

1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:10.080
 So he's not a fan of contemporary art. I don't want to speak for him.

1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:17.520
 I've heard him say derogatory things about some of it. Doesn't mean he doesn't love some other

1:44:17.520 --> 1:44:23.600
 parts of it. So I wonder if there's just a higher learning curve, a steeper learning curve for

1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:29.440
 contemporary art, meaning like it takes more work to appreciate the stories, the context from which

1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:36.160
 you're like thinking about this work. It feels like in order to appreciate the art, contemporary,

1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:40.400
 certain pieces of contemporary art, you have to know the story better behind the art.

1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:45.280
 I think that's true for many people, but I think it's a funny shape distribution

1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:49.360
 because there's a whole other set of people, sometimes just small children,

1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:53.600
 and they get abstract art more easily. You show them Vermeer or Rembrandt,

1:44:53.600 --> 1:45:00.640
 they don't get it. But just like a wall of color, they're in love with it. So

1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:05.600
 I don't think I know the full story. Again, some strange kind of distribution. The entry barriers

1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:09.040
 are super high or super low, but not that often in between.

1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:15.440
 But you were challenged saying that there's a lot to be explored in contemporary art.

1:45:15.440 --> 1:45:19.840
 It's just you need to learn.

1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:24.640
 Yeah, it's one of the most profound bodies of human thought out there, and it's part of the

1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:31.120
 humanities. And yes, there are people who also don't like podcasts, right? And that's fine.

1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:37.840
 He's also been a scholar of food. We're just going through the entirety of the human experience

1:45:37.840 --> 1:45:46.000
 today on this humanities podcast. Another absurd question, say this conversation is the last thing

1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:50.640
 you ever do in your life. We're in the suit, would murder you at the end of the conversation.

1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:55.440
 So this is your last day on earth, but I would offer you a last meal. What would that meal

1:45:56.400 --> 1:46:00.640
 contain? We can also travel to other parts of the world. Well, we have to travel because

1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:04.880
 my preferred last meal here, I probably had like two nights ago.

1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:11.360
 Which is what? Can you describe or not? The best restaurant around here is called Mama Chang's,

1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:18.320
 and it's in Fairfax, and it's food from Wuhan, actually. And they take pandemic safety seriously,

1:46:18.320 --> 1:46:24.640
 in addition to the food being very good. But this is what I would do. I would fly to Hermosillo

1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:31.120
 in northern Mexico, which is some of the best food in Mexico, but I sadly only had two days there.

1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:38.080
 So somewhere like Oaxaca, Puebla, I think they have food just as good, or some people would

1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:44.240
 say better, but I've spent a lot of time in those places. Wait, is it possible the scarcity of time

1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:48.720
 contributed to the richness of the experience? Of course, but the point is that scarcity still

1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:55.520
 holds. So I want one more dose of the food from Hermosillo. Can we describe what the food is?

1:46:55.520 --> 1:46:59.680
 It's the one kind of Mexican food that at least nominally is just like the Mexican food you get

1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:05.680
 in the US. So there are burritos, there's fajitas. It doesn't taste at all like our stuff. But again,

1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:11.040
 nominally, it's the part of Mexican food that made it into the US, was then transformed.

1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:16.160
 Yes. But it's in a way the most familiar. But for that reason, it's the most radical,

1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:20.480
 because you have to rethink all these things you know, and they're way better in Hermosillo.

1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:25.280
 Hardly any tourists go there. Like there's nothing to see in Hermosillo. Nothing to do

1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:30.640
 other than eat. It's not ruined by any outsiders. It's this longstanding tradition,

1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:37.280
 dirt cheap. And the thing to do there is just sweet talk a taxi driver into first taking you

1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:43.120
 seriously and then trusting you enough to know that you trust him to bring you to the very best

1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:53.680
 like food stands. So where's the magic of that nominally similar entity of the burrito? Where's

1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:58.560
 the magic come from? Is it the taxi ride? Is it the whole experience? Or is there something

1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:03.840
 actually in the food? Well, you can break the food down part by part. So if you think of the beef,

1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:09.840
 the beef there will be dry aged just out in the air in a way the FDA here would never permit.

1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:15.680
 Like they dry age it till it turns green, but it is phenomenal. The quality of the chilies.

1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:21.520
 So here, there's only a small number of kinds of chilies you can get. In most parts of Mexico,

1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:25.200
 there's quite a large number of chilies you can get. They're different, they're fresher,

1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:33.680
 but it's just like a different thing, the chilies. The wheat used, so this is wheat territory,

1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:39.840
 not corn territory, which is itself interesting. The wheat is more diverse and more complex. Here,

1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:44.400
 it's more homogenized, obviously cheaper, more efficient, but there it is better.

1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:51.840
 Nonpasteurized cheeses are legal in all parts of Mexico, and they can be white and gooey and

1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:56.560
 amazing in a way that here, again, it's just against the law. You could legalize them. The

1:48:56.560 --> 1:49:00.720
 demand wouldn't be that great. There's a black market in these cheeses that Latino groceries

1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:05.280
 are around here, but you just can't get that much of it. So the cheese, the meat, the wheat,

1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:12.960
 all different in significant ways, the chilies. I don't think the onions really matter much.

1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:18.560
 Garlic, I don't know. I wouldn't put much stock in that, but that's a lot of the core food,

1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:24.160
 and then it's cooked much better, and everything's super fresh. The food chain is not relying on

1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:30.240
 refrigeration, and this is one thing Russia and US have in common. We were early pioneers in food

1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:35.360
 refrigeration, and that made a lot of our foods worse quite early, and it took us a long time to

1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:42.320
 dig out of that because big countries, right? You've had an extensive rail system in Russia,

1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:49.200
 USSR, a long time, which makes it easier to freeze and then ship. What about the actual cooking,

1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:56.400
 the chef? Is there an artistry to the simple? Of course. I hesitate to call the burrito simple,

1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:02.640
 but... And there's no brain drain out of cooking. So if you're in the United States and you're very

1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:07.360
 talented, I'm not saying there aren't talented chefs. Of course there are, but there's so many

1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:12.560
 other things to pull people away. But in Mexico, there's so much talent going into food, as there

1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:19.440
 is in China, which would be another candidate for last meal questions, or India. Well, India.

1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:25.280
 That's not even get started. Unbelievable. There's a million things we could talk about here,

1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:30.880
 but you've written about Jiro, dreams of sushi. It's just a really clean, good example that people

1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:41.360
 are aware of mastery in the art of the simple in food. What do you make of that obsessive pursuit

1:50:41.360 --> 1:50:47.680
 of perfection in creating simple food? Sushi is about perfection, but it's a bit like the Beatles

1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:52.880
 White album, which people think is simple and not overproduced. It's in a funny way their most

1:50:52.880 --> 1:50:58.080
 overproduced album, but it's produced just perfectly. It sounds simple. It's really hard to

1:50:58.080 --> 1:51:02.960
 produce music to the point where it's going to sound so simple and not sound like sludge,

1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:07.520
 like let it be album. There's some great songs, but a lot of it sounds like sludge,

1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:12.800
 one after 909. That's sludge. I dig a pony. It's sludge. Like it's a bit interesting.

1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:18.000
 It's not that good. It doesn't sound that good. White album, like the best half, like Dear Prudence,

1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:24.320
 sounds perfect. Sounds simple. Cry baby cry. It's not simple. Back in the USSR. Super complex.

1:51:24.320 --> 1:51:30.480
 So sushi is like that. It's because it's so incredibly not simple, starting with the rice.

1:51:31.440 --> 1:51:35.840
 You try to refine it to make it appear super simple, and that's the most complex thing of all.

1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:44.480
 So do you admire, I mean, we're not talking about days, weeks, months. We're talking about

1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:50.160
 years, generations of doing the same thing over and over and over again. Do you admire that kind

1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:56.400
 of sticking to the, does that, you know, we talked about our admiration of the weird. That doesn't

1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:05.120
 feel weird. That seems like discipline and dedication to like a stoic minimalism or something like that.

1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:09.920
 I'm happy they do it, but I actually feel bad about it. I feel they're sacrificial victims to me,

1:52:10.720 --> 1:52:16.720
 which I benefit from. But don't you ever think like, gee, you're a great master sushi chef.

1:52:16.720 --> 1:52:22.720
 Wouldn't you be happier if you did something else? Doesn't seem to happen.

1:52:23.280 --> 1:52:28.320
 That might be something that a weird mind, maybe it is weird people, and maybe they're

1:52:28.320 --> 1:52:33.600
 really enjoying it, but like to learn how to pack rice for 10 years before they let you do

1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:39.120
 anything else. It's like these Indian, you know, Sarod players, they just spent five years tapping

1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:46.080
 at rhythms before they're allowed to touch their instruments. Well, actually, to defend that,

1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:51.840
 it's kind of like graduate school, right? Well, I think graduate school, perhaps I,

1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:58.080
 graduate school is full of like every single day is full surprises, I would say.

1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:05.040
 I did martial arts for a long time, I do martial arts, and I've always loved kind of the Russian

1:53:05.040 --> 1:53:11.760
 way of drilling is doing the same technique. I don't know if this applies in intellectual or

1:53:11.760 --> 1:53:17.440
 academic disciplines where you can do the same thing over and over and over again, thousands

1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:24.800
 and thousands and thousands of times. What I've discovered through that process is you get to

1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:30.640
 start to appreciate the tiniest of details and find the beauty in them. People who go to like

1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:36.720
 monasteries to meditate, talk about this, is when you just sit in silence and don't do anything,

1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:42.720
 you start to appreciate how much complexity and beauty there is in just the movement of a finger.

1:53:42.720 --> 1:53:48.720
 Like you can spend the whole day joyously thinking about how fun it is to move a finger.

1:53:50.720 --> 1:53:56.240
 And then you can almost become your full weird self about the tiniest details of life.

1:53:56.240 --> 1:54:00.640
 The thing you've got to wonder, like, is there a free lunch in there? Are the rest of us moving

1:54:00.640 --> 1:54:06.320
 around too much? Yeah, exactly. They sure feel like they found a free lunch,

1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:12.000
 that people meditate, they're onto something. I tend to think it's like artists that some

1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:16.560
 percent of people are like that, but most are not. And for most of us, there's no free lunch.

1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:20.320
 Like my free lunch is to move around a lot in search of lunch, in fact.

1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:29.840
 Well, with all the food talk, you made me hungry. What books, three or so books, if you can come,

1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:35.280
 if any, come to mind, technical fiction philosophical, would you recommend? Had a big impact

1:54:35.280 --> 1:54:39.680
 on you, or you just drew some insights from throughout your life?

1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:45.600
 Well, two of them we've already discussed. One is Plato's Dialogues, which I started reading

1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:51.680
 when I was like 13. Another is Ein Rand, Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal. But I would say

1:54:52.320 --> 1:54:57.760
 the Friedrich Hayek essay, The Use of Knowledge in Society, which is about how decentralized

1:54:57.760 --> 1:55:03.120
 mechanisms can work, also why they might go wrong. And that's where you start to understand

1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:07.920
 the price system, capitalism. And that was in a book called Individualism and Economic Order,

1:55:07.920 --> 1:55:11.920
 but it was just a few essays in that book. Those are maybe the three I would say.

1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:13.920
 Can you elaborate a little bit on the...

1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:19.200
 Say the price of copper goes up, right, because there's a problem with the copper mine in Chile

1:55:19.200 --> 1:55:24.080
 or Bolivia. So the price of copper goes up all around the world. People are led to economize

1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:29.280
 copper, to look for substitutes for copper, to change their production processes, to change

1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:35.760
 the goods and services they buy, to build homes a different way. And this one event creates this

1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:42.480
 one tiny change in information. It gets into your AI work very directly. And how much complexity

1:55:42.480 --> 1:55:48.800
 that one change engenders in a meaningful, coherent way. How the different pieces of the

1:55:48.800 --> 1:55:56.240
 price system fit together. Hayek really laid out very clearly. And it's like an AI problem.

1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:01.360
 And how well, not for everything, but for many things, we solve that AI problem. I learned,

1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:04.000
 I was, I think, 13, maybe 14 when I read Hayek.

1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:06.640
 The distributed nature of things there.

1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:10.480
 And it's like your work on human attention, like how much can we take in?

1:56:10.480 --> 1:56:10.800
 Yes.

1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:16.880
 Very often, not that much. And how many of the advances of modern civilization you need to

1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:21.200
 understand as a response to that constraint? I got that also from Hayek.

1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:22.480
 What's the title of the book again?

1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:27.520
 It's reprinted in a lot of books at this point. But back then, the book was called

1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:34.400
 Individualism and Economic Order. But the essays online, Hayek, Use of Knowledge in Society,

1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:38.400
 there are open access versions of it through Google. And you don't need the whole book.

1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:39.920
 So it's a very good book.

1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:47.760
 Again, one of those profound looking over the ocean, maybe sitting on a porch,

1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:54.880
 maybe with a drink of some kind. And a young kid comes by and asks you for advice.

1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:59.040
 What advice would you give to a drink? That's my advice. I'm serious.

1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:10.800
 So, okay, after that, what advice would you give to a young person today as they take on life,

1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:18.240
 whether a career in academia in general, or just a life which is probably more important than career?

1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:23.920
 Most good advice is context specific. But here are my two generic pieces of advice.

1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:30.000
 First, get a mentor. Both career, but anything you want to learn. Say you want to learn about

1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:35.760
 contemporary art. People write me this. What book should I read? It's probably not going to

1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:39.920
 work that way. You need a mentor. Yes, you should read some books on it. But you want a mentor to

1:57:39.920 --> 1:57:44.960
 help you frame them, take you around to some art, talk about it with you. So get as many mentors as

1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:53.120
 you can in the things you want to learn and then cast you a quick tangent on that, presumably a

1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:59.120
 good mentor. Of course. Is there begging the question in there? It's complicated, right?

1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:02.480
 What is complicated? Is there a lot of damage to be done from a bad mentor?

1:58:03.200 --> 1:58:06.960
 I don't think that much because it's very easy to drop mentors. And in fact, it's quite hard to

1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:14.080
 maintain them. Good mentors tend to be busy. Bad mentors tend to be busy. And you can try on mentors

1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:17.680
 and maybe they're not good for you, but you still, there's a good chance you'll learn something.

1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:24.160
 Like I had a mentor. I was an undergrad. He was a Stalinist. He edited the book called The Essential

1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:29.520
 Stalin. Brilliant guy. I learned a tremendous amount from him. Was he like as a Stalinist,

1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:37.280
 a good mentor for me? Fanifiak? Well, no. But for a year, it was tremendous. Yeah.

1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:41.600
 He introduced me like to, you know, Soviet and Eastern European science fiction,

1:58:41.600 --> 1:58:45.280
 because he was a Marxist. Like that's what I took from him, among other things.

1:58:45.280 --> 1:58:52.560
 Any advice on finding a good mentor? Daniel Kahneman has, somebody just popped us to mind

1:58:52.560 --> 1:58:56.880
 as somebody who was able to find exceptionally good collaborators throughout his life.

1:58:56.880 --> 1:59:00.800
 There's not many bright minds that find collaborators. They often,

1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:08.640
 which I ultimately see what a mentor is. Yeah. Method to it. Be interesting, be direct and try.

1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:14.240
 It's not like a perfect formula, but it's amazing how many people don't even do those things.

1:59:14.240 --> 1:59:20.000
 Be interesting, be direct and try. Like what you want from a better known person,

1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:25.680
 I would just say be very direct with them. Yeah. Beautiful. What's the second piece of advice?

1:59:25.680 --> 1:59:32.240
 Build small groups of peers. They don't have to be your age, but very often they'll be your age,

1:59:32.240 --> 1:59:36.080
 especially if you're younger, with broadly similar interests, but there can be different

1:59:36.080 --> 1:59:42.240
 points of view. People you hang out with, which can include in a WhatsApp group online. And like

1:59:42.240 --> 1:59:46.720
 every day or almost every day, they're talking about the thing you care about, trying to solve

1:59:46.720 --> 1:59:51.680
 problems in that thing. And that's your small group and you really like them and they like you

1:59:51.680 --> 1:59:56.240
 and you care what you think about each other. And you have this common interest. That's for

1:59:56.240 --> 2:00:21.920
 human connection or that's for development of ideas. It's both. They're not that different.
