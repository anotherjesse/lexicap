00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
 There's no reason to think that the ocean ends just beyond your horizon.

00:03.760 --> 00:09.360
 And likewise, there's no reason to think that the aftermath of our big bang

00:09.360 --> 00:12.600
 ends just at the boundary of what we can see.

00:12.600 --> 00:18.200
 Indeed, there are quite strong arguments that it probably goes on about 100 times further.

00:18.200 --> 00:24.040
 And it may even go on so much further that all combinatorials are replicated.

00:24.040 --> 00:30.400
 And there's another set of people like us sitting in a room like this.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.800
 The following is a conversation with Lord Martin Rees,

00:33.800 --> 00:37.480
 emeritus professor of cosmology and astrophysics at Cambridge University

00:37.480 --> 00:42.680
 and cofounder of the Center for the Study of Existential Risk.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.680
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.080
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.440
 And now, dear friends, here's Martin Rees.

00:52.440 --> 00:57.160
 In your 2020 Scientific American article, you write that, quote,

00:57.160 --> 01:02.200
 today we know that the universe is far bigger and stranger than anyone suspected.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.360
 So what do you think are the strangest, maybe the most beautiful,

01:06.360 --> 01:11.240
 or maybe even the most terrifying things lurking out there in the cosmos?

01:11.240 --> 01:17.000
 Well, of course, we're still groping for any detail understanding of the remote parts of the universe.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.600
 But of course, what we've learned in the last few decades is really two things.

01:22.600 --> 01:29.000
 First, we've understood that the universe had an origin about 13.8 billion years ago

01:29.000 --> 01:34.920
 in a so called Big Bang, a hot 10 states whose very beginnings are still shrouded in mystery.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.440
 And also, we've learned more about the extreme things in it,

01:38.440 --> 01:42.840
 black holes, neutron stars, explosions of various kinds.

01:42.840 --> 01:49.960
 And one of the most potentially exciting discoveries in the last 20 years, mainly in the last 10,

01:49.960 --> 01:56.840
 has been the realization that most of the stars in the sky are orbited by retinas of planets,

01:56.840 --> 02:01.480
 just as the sun is orbited by the Earth and the other familiar planets.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.680
 And this, of course, makes the night sky farmer interesting.

02:04.680 --> 02:09.080
 What you see up there aren't just points of light, but they're planetary systems.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.800
 And that raises the question, could there be life out there?

02:11.800 --> 02:15.880
 And so that is an exciting problem for the 21st century.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.480
 So when you see all those lights out there, you immediately imagine

02:19.480 --> 02:23.800
 all the planetary worlds that are around them.

02:23.800 --> 02:27.160
 And they potentially have all kinds of different lives,

02:28.200 --> 02:31.240
 living organisms, life forms, or different histories.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.280
 That we don't know at all.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.440
 We know that these planets are there.

02:34.440 --> 02:41.480
 We know that they have masses and orbits, rather like the planets of our solar system.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.680
 But we don't know at all if there's any life on any of them.

02:44.680 --> 02:48.840
 I mean, it's entirely logically possible that life is unique to this Earth.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.200
 Doesn't exist anywhere.

02:50.200 --> 02:55.720
 On the other hand, it could be that the origin of life is something which happens routinely,

02:55.720 --> 03:00.200
 given conditions like the young Earth, in which case there could be literally billions

03:00.200 --> 03:04.200
 of places in our galaxy where some sort of biosphere has evolved.

03:04.200 --> 03:09.720
 And settling where the truth lies between those two extremes

03:09.720 --> 03:11.800
 is a challenge for the coming decades.

03:12.760 --> 03:18.920
 So certainly we're either lucky to be here or very, very, very lucky to be here.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.760
 I guess that's the difference.

03:22.600 --> 03:27.240
 Where do you fall, your own estimate, your own guess on this question?

03:27.240 --> 03:29.240
 Are we alone in the universe, do you think?

03:29.800 --> 03:33.480
 I think we foolish to give any firm estimate because we just don't know.

03:34.040 --> 03:39.400
 And that's just an example of how we are depending on greater observations

03:39.400 --> 03:42.360
 and also, incidentally, in the case of life.

03:42.360 --> 03:48.120
 We've got to take account of the fact that, as I always say to my scientific colleagues,

03:48.120 --> 03:51.480
 biology is a much harder subject than physics.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.800
 And most of the universe, as we know about, could be understood by physics.

03:56.440 --> 04:02.120
 But we've got to remember that even the smallest living organism, an insect,

04:02.120 --> 04:05.720
 is far more complicated with layer on layer complexity

04:05.720 --> 04:09.880
 than the most complicated star or galaxy.

04:10.440 --> 04:14.120
 You know, that's the funny thing about physics and biology.

04:14.680 --> 04:18.760
 The dream of physicists in the 20th century and maybe this century

04:18.760 --> 04:21.080
 is to discover the theory of everything.

04:22.040 --> 04:29.080
 And there's a sense that once you discover that theory, you will understand everything.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.120
 If we unlock the mysteries of how the universe works,

04:32.120 --> 04:36.440
 would you be able to understand how life emerges

04:36.440 --> 04:39.720
 from that fabric of the universe that we understand?

04:39.720 --> 04:42.520
 I think the phrase theory of everything is very misleading

04:43.080 --> 04:50.680
 because it's used to describe a theory which unifies the three laws of microphysics,

04:51.240 --> 04:54.520
 electricity, magnetism, and weak interaction with gravity.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.600
 So it's an important step forward for particle physicists.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.600
 But the lack of such a theory doesn't hold up any other scientists.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.160
 Anyone doing biology or most of physics is not held up at all

05:07.160 --> 05:09.560
 through not understanding subnuclear physics.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.280
 They're held up because they're dealing with things that are very complicated.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.880
 And that's especially true of anything biological.

05:15.880 --> 05:20.600
 So what's holding up biologists is not a lack of the so called theory of everything.

05:20.600 --> 05:25.160
 It's the inability to understand things which are very complicated.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.640
 What do you think we'll understand first?

05:27.640 --> 05:32.360
 How the universe works or how the human body works deeply?

05:32.360 --> 05:34.840
 Like from a fundamental, deep level?

05:34.840 --> 05:37.560
 Well, I think, and perhaps we can come back to it later,

05:37.560 --> 05:43.880
 that there are only limited prospects of ever being able to understand

05:43.880 --> 05:48.040
 with unedged human brains the most fundamental theories

05:48.040 --> 05:50.440
 linking together all the forces of nature.

05:50.440 --> 05:53.000
 I think that may be a limitation of the human brains.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.480
 But I also think that we can, perhaps aided by computer simulations,

05:59.480 --> 06:03.880
 understand a bit more of the complexity of nature.

06:03.880 --> 06:10.600
 But even understanding a simple organism from the atom up is very, very difficult.

06:10.600 --> 06:16.520
 And I think extreme reductionists have a very misleading perception.

06:16.520 --> 06:21.240
 They tend to think that in a sense we are all solutions to Freudian's equation.

06:21.240 --> 06:25.480
 But that isn't the way we'll ever understand anything.

06:25.480 --> 06:30.200
 It may be true that we are reductionists in a sense if we believe

06:30.200 --> 06:34.680
 that that's the case, we don't believe in any special life force in living things.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.440
 But nonetheless, no one thinks that we can understand a living thing

06:38.440 --> 06:40.920
 by solving Freudian's equation.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.640
 To take an example which isn't as complicated,

06:43.640 --> 06:47.560
 lots of people study the flow of fluids like water.

06:47.560 --> 06:51.320
 Why waves break, why flows go turbulent, things like that.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.920
 This is a serious branch of applied mathematics and engineering.

06:54.920 --> 07:01.160
 And in doing this, you have concepts of viscosity, turbulence, and things like that.

07:01.160 --> 07:05.720
 Now, you can understand quite a lot about how water behaves

07:05.720 --> 07:09.400
 and how waves break in terms of those concepts.

07:09.400 --> 07:14.280
 But the fact that any breaking wave is a solution

07:14.280 --> 07:18.760
 of Freudian's equation for tens of 30 particles,

07:18.760 --> 07:21.640
 even if you could solve that, which you clearly can't,

07:21.640 --> 07:23.480
 would not give you any insight.

07:23.480 --> 07:29.160
 So the important thing is that every science has its own irreducible concepts

07:29.160 --> 07:32.360
 in which you get the best explanation.

07:32.360 --> 07:38.360
 So it may be in chemistry, things like balance, in biology,

07:38.360 --> 07:41.400
 concepts in cell biology,

07:41.400 --> 07:46.120
 and in ecology, there are concepts like imprinting, et cetera.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.320
 And in psychology, there are other concepts.

07:49.320 --> 07:54.120
 So in a sense, the sciences are like a tall building

07:54.120 --> 07:57.800
 where you have basic physics most fundamental,

07:57.800 --> 08:02.840
 then the rest of physics, then chemistry, then cell biology, et cetera,

08:02.840 --> 08:06.840
 all the way up to the, I guess, economists and the penthouse and all that.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.280
 We have that.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.800
 And that's true in a sense, but it's not true

08:11.800 --> 08:18.200
 that it's like a building in that it's made unstable by an unstable base,

08:18.200 --> 08:22.200
 because if you're a chemist, biologist, or an economist,

08:22.200 --> 08:24.600
 you're facing challenging problems,

08:24.600 --> 08:29.800
 but they're not made any worse by uncertainty about subnuclear physics.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.920
 And at every level, just because you understand the rules of the game

08:34.920 --> 08:38.360
 or have some understanding of the rules of the game

08:38.360 --> 08:44.200
 doesn't mean you know what kind of beautiful things that game creates.

08:44.200 --> 08:49.640
 Right. So if you're interested in birds and how they fly,

08:49.640 --> 08:55.480
 then things like imprinting the baby on the mother and all that

08:55.480 --> 09:00.120
 and things like that are what you need to understand.

09:00.120 --> 09:04.920
 You couldn't even, in principle, solve this vertical equation,

09:04.920 --> 09:08.600
 how an albatross wanders for thousands of miles to the southern ocean

09:08.600 --> 09:11.560
 and comes back and then coughs up food for its young.

09:11.560 --> 09:16.280
 That's something we can understand in a sense and predict the behavior,

09:16.280 --> 09:19.720
 but it's not because we can solve it on the atomic scale.

09:19.720 --> 09:23.960
 You mentioned that there might be some fundamental limitation to the human brain

09:23.960 --> 09:29.000
 that limits our ability to understand something that we can't understand.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.600
 To understand some aspect of how the universe works, that's really interesting.

09:33.400 --> 09:38.680
 That's sad, actually, to the degree it's true, it's sad.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.960
 So what do you mean by that?

09:39.960 --> 09:45.080
 I would simply say that just as a monkey can't understand quantum theory

09:45.080 --> 09:49.160
 or even Newtonian physics, there's no particular reason

09:49.160 --> 09:52.440
 why the human brain should evolve to be well matched

09:52.440 --> 09:54.680
 to understanding a deepest aspect of reality.

09:54.680 --> 10:00.360
 And I suspect that there may be aspects that we are not even aware of

10:00.360 --> 10:05.160
 and couldn't really fully comprehend, but as an intermediate step towards that,

10:05.720 --> 10:08.360
 one thing which I think is very interesting possibility

10:08.360 --> 10:10.520
 is the extent to which AI can help us.

10:11.080 --> 10:16.040
 I mean, I think if we take the example of so called theories of everything,

10:16.040 --> 10:22.280
 one of which is string theory, string theory involves very complicated geometry

10:22.280 --> 10:24.920
 and structures in 10 dimensions.

10:25.800 --> 10:35.080
 And it's certainly, in my view, on the cards that the physics of 10 dimensions,

10:36.520 --> 10:41.720
 very complicated geometry, may be too hard for a human being to work through,

10:42.440 --> 10:50.120
 but could be worked through by an AI with the advantage of the huge processing power,

10:50.120 --> 10:55.000
 which enables them to learn world championship chess within a few hours just by watching games.

10:55.000 --> 11:02.120
 So there's every reason to expect that these machines could help us to solve these problems.

11:02.120 --> 11:07.080
 And of course, if that's the way we came to understand where the string theory was right,

11:07.080 --> 11:12.440
 it should be in a sense frustrating because you wouldn't get the sort of ah ha insight,

11:12.440 --> 11:14.840
 which is the greatest satisfaction doing science.

11:14.840 --> 11:21.160
 But on the other hand, if a machine churns away a 10 dimensional geometry,

11:21.160 --> 11:26.360
 figuring out all the possible origamis and wound up in extra dimensions,

11:26.360 --> 11:31.800
 if it comes out at the end, spews out the correct mass of the electron,

11:31.800 --> 11:34.760
 the fact that there are three kinds of neutrinos, something like that,

11:34.760 --> 11:36.840
 you would know that there was some truth in the theory.

11:37.560 --> 11:41.560
 And so we may have a theory which we come to trust because it does predict

11:41.560 --> 11:45.480
 it does protect things that we can observe and check,

11:45.480 --> 11:50.840
 but we may never really understand the full workings of it to the extent that we do more or less

11:51.480 --> 11:57.880
 understand how most phenomena can be explained in a fundamental way.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.560
 Of course, in the case of quantum theory,

11:59.560 --> 12:02.760
 many people would say, understand if there's still some mystery,

12:02.760 --> 12:04.760
 you don't quite understand why it works.

12:04.760 --> 12:08.360
 But there could be deeper mysteries when we get to these unified theories,

12:08.360 --> 12:13.560
 where there's a big gap between what a computer can print out for us at the end

12:14.120 --> 12:17.320
 and what we can actually grasp and think through in our heads.

12:17.880 --> 12:22.200
 Yeah, it's interesting that the idea that there could be things a computer could tell us that

12:22.200 --> 12:29.000
 is true. And maybe it can even help us understand why it's true a little bit.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.360
 But ultimately, it's still a long journey to really deeply understand the whys of it.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.160
 Yes, and that's the limitation of our brain.

12:37.160 --> 12:40.840
 Well, we can try to sneak up to it in different ways,

12:40.840 --> 12:42.520
 given the limitations of our brain.

12:42.520 --> 12:47.400
 Have you, I've gotten a chance to spend the day at DeepMind, Dr. Dennis Lasabas.

12:47.400 --> 12:52.360
 His big dream is to apply AI to the questions of science,

12:52.360 --> 12:54.120
 certainly to the questions of physics.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.800
 Have you gotten a chance to interact with them?

12:55.800 --> 12:59.560
 Well, I've known quite well. He's one of my heroes, certainly.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.200
 I'm sure he would say the same.

13:02.200 --> 13:06.200
 And I remember the first time I met him, he said that he was like me.

13:06.200 --> 13:10.040
 He wants to understand the universe, but he thought the best thing to do

13:10.040 --> 13:11.960
 was to try and develop AI.

13:11.960 --> 13:15.720
 And then with the help of AI, he'd stand more chance of understanding the universe.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.400
 And I think he's right about that.

13:18.040 --> 13:26.680
 And of course, although we're familiar with the way his computers play go and chess,

13:27.880 --> 13:30.040
 he's already made contributions to science through

13:31.240 --> 13:34.840
 understanding protein folding better than the best human chemists.

13:34.840 --> 13:41.880
 And so already he's on the path to showing ways in which computers have the power to learn

13:41.880 --> 13:46.120
 and do things by having a bit to analyze enormous samples in a short time

13:46.760 --> 13:48.520
 to do better than humans.

13:48.520 --> 13:51.640
 And so I think he would resonate for what I just said,

13:51.640 --> 13:55.320
 that it may be that in these other fundamental questions,

13:55.320 --> 13:57.320
 the computers will play a crucial role.

13:58.120 --> 14:02.120
 Yeah. And they're also doing quantum mechanical simulation of electrons.

14:02.120 --> 14:07.800
 They're doing control of high temperature plasmus fusion reactors.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.480
 Yes. That's a new thing, which is very interesting.

14:09.480 --> 14:14.680
 They can suppress the instabilities in these tokamaks better than any other way.

14:14.680 --> 14:14.920
 Yeah.

14:14.920 --> 14:24.120
 And it's just the march of progress by AIs and science is making big strides.

14:24.120 --> 14:28.280
 Do you think an AI system will win a Nobel Prize in the century?

14:28.280 --> 14:28.840
 What do you think?

14:28.840 --> 14:33.560
 And does that make you sad?

14:33.560 --> 14:36.840
 If I can digress and push in a plug for my next book,

14:36.840 --> 14:40.520
 it has a chapter saying why Nobel Prizes do more harm than good.

14:41.160 --> 14:45.640
 So on a quite separate subject, I think Nobel Prizes do greatly

14:45.640 --> 14:49.160
 damage to the percept of the way science is done.

14:49.160 --> 14:53.800
 Of course, if you ask who or what deserves the credit for any scientific discovery,

14:53.800 --> 14:55.640
 it may be often someone who has an idea,

14:55.640 --> 14:59.000
 a team of people who work a big experiment, etc.

14:59.640 --> 15:05.800
 And of course, it's the quality of the equipment, which is crucial.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.600
 And certainly in the subjects I do in astronomy,

15:09.400 --> 15:16.360
 the huge advances we've had come not from us being more intelligent than Aristotle was,

15:16.360 --> 15:23.080
 but through us having far, far better data from powerful telescopes on the ground and in space.

15:23.080 --> 15:29.880
 And also, incidentally, we've benefited hugely in astronomy from computer simulations,

15:29.880 --> 15:37.000
 because if you are a subatomic physicist, then of course you crash together

15:37.000 --> 15:41.800
 the particles in the big accelerator like the one at CERN and see what happens.

15:41.800 --> 15:47.560
 But I can't crash together two galaxies or two stars and see what happens.

15:47.560 --> 15:53.640
 But in the virtual world of a computer, one can do simulations like that.

15:53.640 --> 16:02.360
 And the power of computers is such that these simulations can yield a phenomena and insights

16:02.360 --> 16:05.000
 which we wouldn't have guessed beforehand.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.800
 And the way we can feel by making progress and trying to understand

16:09.800 --> 16:13.480
 some of these phenomena, why galaxies have the size and shape they do and all that,

16:13.480 --> 16:18.760
 is because we can do simulations tweaking different initial conditions

16:18.760 --> 16:22.600
 and seeing which gives the best fit to what we actually observe.

16:22.600 --> 16:27.960
 And so that's a way in which we've made progress in using computers.

16:27.960 --> 16:31.960
 And incidentally, we also now need them to analyze data,

16:31.960 --> 16:36.120
 because one thinks of astronomy as being traditionally a rather data poor subjects,

16:36.120 --> 16:43.880
 but the European satellite called Gaia has just put online the speeds and colors

16:43.880 --> 16:47.400
 and properties of nearly two billion stars in the Milky Way,

16:48.040 --> 16:50.600
 and which we can do fantastic analyses of.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.440
 And that of course could not be done at all without just the number of crushing capacitors

16:54.440 --> 16:54.920
 computers.

16:54.920 --> 17:00.600
 And the new methods of machine learning actually love raw data,

17:00.600 --> 17:04.760
 the kind that astronomy provides, organized structured raw data.

17:04.760 --> 17:08.280
 Well, indeed, because the reason they really have a benefit over us

17:08.280 --> 17:11.560
 is that they can learn and think so much faster.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.920
 That's how they can learn to play chess and go.

17:14.920 --> 17:18.680
 That's how they can learn to diagnose lung cancer better than a radiologist,

17:19.240 --> 17:23.400
 because they can look at 100,000 scans in a few days,

17:23.400 --> 17:27.480
 whereas no human radiologist sees that many in lifetime.

17:28.280 --> 17:32.200
 Well, there's still a magic to the human intelligence,

17:32.200 --> 17:35.640
 to the intuition, to the common sense reasoning.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.640
 Well, we hope so for now.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.520
 What is the new book that you mentioned?

17:40.520 --> 17:43.560
 The book is called If Science is to Save Us.

17:43.560 --> 17:50.200
 It's coming out in September, and it's on the big challenges of science,

17:52.600 --> 17:57.800
 climate, dealing with biosafety and dealing with cyber safety,

17:57.800 --> 18:03.640
 and also it's got chapters on the way science is organized in a universe,

18:03.640 --> 18:12.280
 it's an academy, et cetera, and the ethics of science and the education and the limits.

18:13.320 --> 18:18.120
 Well, let me actually just stroll around the beautiful and the strange of the universe.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.840
 Over 20 years ago, you hypothesized that we would solve the mystery of dark matter by now.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.960
 So, unfortunately, we didn't quite yet.

18:30.280 --> 18:35.160
 First, what is dark matter and why has it been so tough to figure out?

18:35.160 --> 18:39.560
 Well, I mean, we learned that galaxies and other large scale structures,

18:40.200 --> 18:49.160
 which are moving around but prevent them flying apart by gravity, would be flying apart

18:49.160 --> 18:54.360
 if they only contain the stuff we see, if everything in them was shining,

18:55.080 --> 19:02.680
 and to understand how galaxies formed and why they do remain confined the same size.

19:03.400 --> 19:09.640
 One has to infer that there's about five times as much stuff producing gravitational forces

19:10.360 --> 19:15.880
 than the total amount of stuff in the gas and stars that we see, and that stuff is called dark

19:15.880 --> 19:21.720
 matter. That's like this leading name, it's not dark, it's just transparent, et cetera.

19:21.720 --> 19:30.040
 And the most likely interpretation is that it's a swarm of microscopic particles

19:30.840 --> 19:35.480
 which have no electric charge and the very small cross sections were hitting each other

19:35.480 --> 19:40.920
 and hitting anything else. So, they swarm around and we can detect their collective effects.

19:40.920 --> 19:46.600
 And when we do computer simulations of how galaxies form and evolve and how they emerge

19:46.600 --> 19:55.880
 from the Big Bang, then we get a nice consistent picture if we put in five times as much mass

19:55.880 --> 20:02.680
 in the form of these mysterious dark particles. And, for instance, it works better if we think

20:02.680 --> 20:06.600
 they're not interacting particles than if we think they're a gas which would have shock waves

20:06.600 --> 20:10.360
 and things. So, we know something about the properties of these, but we don't know what they

20:10.360 --> 20:18.440
 are. And the disappointment compared to my guess 20 years ago is that particles answering this

20:18.440 --> 20:23.000
 description have not yet been found. It was thought that the big accelerator, the Large

20:23.000 --> 20:28.440
 Handler Collider at CERN, which is the world's biggest, might have found a new class of particles

20:28.440 --> 20:35.320
 which would have been the obvious candidates. And it hasn't. And some people say, well,

20:35.320 --> 20:41.000
 doc matter can't be there, etc. But what I would argue is that there's a huge amount of parameter

20:41.000 --> 20:46.760
 space that hasn't been explored. There are other kinds of particles called axions which behave

20:46.760 --> 20:54.600
 slightly differently, which are good candidates. And there's a factor of 10 powers of 10 between

20:54.600 --> 21:02.120
 the heaviest particles that could be created by the Large Hadron Collider and the heaviest particles

21:02.120 --> 21:07.160
 which on theoretical grounds could exist without turning into black holes. So, there's a huge amount

21:07.160 --> 21:14.040
 of possible particles which could be out there as remnants of the Big Bang, but which we wouldn't

21:14.040 --> 21:19.240
 be able to detect so easily. So, the fact that we've got new constraints on what the doc matter

21:19.240 --> 21:25.400
 could be doesn't diminish my belief that it's there in the form of particles because we've only

21:25.400 --> 21:33.000
 explored a small fraction of parameter space. So, there's this search. You're literally, upon

21:33.000 --> 21:39.560
 unintended, are searching in the dark here in this giant parameter space of possible particles.

21:39.560 --> 21:44.920
 You're searching for, I mean, there could be all kinds of particles. There could be. And

21:44.920 --> 21:48.680
 there's some which may be very, very hard to detect. But I think we can hope for

21:48.680 --> 21:55.320
 some new theoretical ideas because one point which perhaps you'd like to discuss more is about the

21:55.320 --> 22:02.280
 very early stage of the Big Bang. And the situation now is that we have an outline picture for how the

22:02.280 --> 22:09.800
 universe has evolved from the time when it was expanding in just a nanosecond right up to the

22:09.800 --> 22:19.080
 present. And we could do that because after nanosecond, the physics of the material is in the same

22:19.080 --> 22:25.800
 range that we can test in the lab. After a nanosecond, the particles move around like those in the

22:25.800 --> 22:31.240
 large heterocollider. If you wait for one second, they're rather like in the centers of the hotter

22:31.240 --> 22:37.320
 stars and nuclear actions, please, hydrogen, helium, etc., which fit the data. So, we can with

22:37.320 --> 22:42.040
 confidence extrapolate back to when the universe was a nanosecond old. Indeed, I think we can do

22:42.040 --> 22:46.840
 it with as much confidence as anything a geologist tells you about the early history of the earth.

22:46.840 --> 22:55.080
 And that's huge progress in the last 50 years. But any progress puts in sharper focus new mysteries.

22:55.080 --> 23:01.640
 And of course, the new mysteries in this context are why is the universe expanding the way it is?

23:01.640 --> 23:08.920
 Why does it contain this mixture of atoms and dark matter and radiation? And why does it have

23:08.920 --> 23:14.120
 the properties which allow galaxies to form, being fairly smooth but not completely smooth?

23:14.120 --> 23:20.360
 And the answer to those questions are generally believed to lie in a much, much earlier stage

23:20.360 --> 23:26.760
 of the universe when conditions were much more extreme and therefore far beyond the stage where

23:26.760 --> 23:32.680
 we had the foot holding experiments, very theoretical. And so, we don't have a convincing theory. We

23:32.680 --> 23:37.960
 just have ideas until we have something like string theory or some other clues to the ultra

23:37.960 --> 23:44.520
 early universe that's going to remain speculative. So, there's a big gap. And to say how big the

23:44.520 --> 23:52.200
 gap is, if we take the observable universe, a bit more than 10 billion light years, then

23:52.200 --> 23:58.920
 when the universe was a nanosecond old, that would have been squeezed down to the size of our solar

23:58.920 --> 24:07.240
 system or compressed into that volume. But the times we're talking about when the key properties

24:07.240 --> 24:13.320
 of the universe were first imprinted were times when that entire universe was squeezed down to

24:13.320 --> 24:19.720
 the size of a tennis ball or baseball, if you prefer, and it emerged from something microscopic.

24:19.720 --> 24:25.800
 So, it's a huge extrapolation and it's not surprising that since it's so far from our

24:25.800 --> 24:30.360
 experimental range of detectability, we are still groping for ideas.

24:31.400 --> 24:38.840
 But you think first theory will reach into that place and then experiment will perhaps one day

24:38.840 --> 24:45.400
 catch up? Well, I think in a sense it's a combination. I think what we hope for is that

24:45.400 --> 24:53.960
 there'll be a theory which applies to the early universe, but which also has consequences which

24:53.960 --> 25:01.880
 we can test in our present day universe, like discovering my new treatise exists or things

25:01.880 --> 25:07.320
 like that. And that's the thing which, as I mentioned, we may perhaps need a bit of AI to

25:07.320 --> 25:14.040
 help us to calculate. But I think the hope would be that we will have a theory which

25:14.040 --> 25:19.560
 applies under the very, very extreme early stages of the universe, which gains credibility and

25:19.560 --> 25:25.240
 gains confidence because it also manages to account for otherwise unexplained features of

25:26.040 --> 25:29.480
 the no energy world and what people call a standard model of particle physics,

25:30.040 --> 25:34.200
 where there are lots of undetermined numbers. So, it may help with that.

25:35.080 --> 25:39.400
 So, we're dancing between physics and philosophy a little bit, but what do you think

25:39.400 --> 25:46.840
 happened before the Big Bang? So, this seems, this feels like something that's out of the

25:46.840 --> 25:52.440
 reach of science. It's out of the reach of present science because science develops and

25:52.440 --> 25:58.200
 as the front is advanced, then new problems come into focus that couldn't be postulated before.

25:58.200 --> 26:03.960
 I mean, if I think of my own career, when I was a student, the evidence for the Big Bang

26:03.960 --> 26:10.200
 was pretty weak, whereas now it's extremely strong. But we are now thinking about the

26:11.320 --> 26:18.120
 reason why the universe is the way it is and all that. So, I would put all these things we've

26:18.120 --> 26:24.600
 just mentioned in the category of speculative science and identity of bifurcation between that

26:24.600 --> 26:30.920
 and philosophy. But of course, to answer your question, if we do want to understand the very

26:30.920 --> 26:37.240
 early universe, then we've got to realize that it may involve even more counterintuitive concepts

26:37.880 --> 26:44.920
 than quantum theory does, because it's a condition even further away from everyday world

26:44.920 --> 26:52.040
 than quantum theory is and remember our lives, our brains evolved and haven't changed much since

26:52.040 --> 26:58.440
 our ancestors roamed the African savannah and looked at the everyday world. And it's rather

26:58.440 --> 27:02.680
 amazing that we've been able to make some sense of the quantum micro world and of the cosmos.

27:02.680 --> 27:07.320
 But there may be some things which are beyond us and certainly, as we implied,

27:07.320 --> 27:12.840
 there are things that we don't yet understand at all. And of course, one concept we might have

27:12.840 --> 27:20.040
 to jettison is the idea of three dimensions of space and time just ticking away. There are

27:20.040 --> 27:27.400
 lots of ideas. I mean, I think Stephen Hawking had an idea that talking about what's what hasn't

27:27.400 --> 27:31.880
 before the Big Bang, it's like asking what happens if you go north from the North Pole,

27:31.880 --> 27:37.480
 you know, it somehow closes off. That's just one idea. I don't like that idea, but that's a possible

27:37.480 --> 27:45.800
 one. And so we just don't know what happened at the very beginning of the Big Bang, were there

27:45.800 --> 27:54.360
 many Big Bangs rather than one, etc. And those are issues which we may be able to get some

27:54.360 --> 28:05.160
 foothold on from some new theory. But even then, we won't be able to directly test the theories.

28:05.160 --> 28:11.320
 But I think it's a heresy to think you have to be able to test every prediction of a theory.

28:11.320 --> 28:17.880
 Let me give another example. We take seriously what Einstein's theory says about the inside of

28:17.880 --> 28:24.040
 black holes, even though we can't observe them, because that theory has been vindicated in many

28:24.040 --> 28:29.160
 other places in cosmology and black holes, gravitational waves and all those things.

28:29.960 --> 28:36.840
 Likewise, if we had a theory which explains some things about the early history of our Big Bang

28:36.840 --> 28:44.360
 and the present universe, then we would take seriously the inference if it predicted many

28:44.360 --> 28:49.320
 Big Bangs, not one, even though we can't predict the other ones. So the example is that we can

28:49.320 --> 28:56.120
 take seriously a prediction if it's the consequence of a theory that we believe on other grounds.

28:56.120 --> 29:01.720
 We don't need to be able to detect another Big Bang in order to take it seriously.

29:01.720 --> 29:09.880
 It may not be a proof, but it's a good indication that this is the direction where the truth lies.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.040
 Yeah, if the theory is getting confidence in other ways.

29:12.040 --> 29:17.800
 Yes. Where do you sense? Do you think there's other universes besides our own?

29:17.800 --> 29:24.920
 There are well defined theories which make assumptions about the physics at the relevant

29:24.920 --> 29:31.320
 time. And this time, incidentally, is 10 to the power minus 36 seconds or earlier than that.

29:31.320 --> 29:38.200
 So this tiny sliver of time. And there are some theories, famous one due to Andre Linday,

29:39.000 --> 29:45.400
 the Russian cosmologist now at Stanford called eternal inflation, which did predict

29:45.400 --> 29:53.320
 an eternal production of new Big Bangs, as it were. And that's based on specific assumptions

29:53.320 --> 29:58.440
 about the physics. But those assumptions, of course, are just hypotheses which aren't vindicated.

29:58.440 --> 30:05.480
 But there are other theories which only predict one Big Bang. So I think we should be open minded

30:05.480 --> 30:10.680
 and not dogmatic about these options until we do understand the relevant physics.

30:10.680 --> 30:17.000
 But there are these different scenarios of very different ideas about this. But I think all of

30:17.000 --> 30:23.640
 them have the feature that physical reality is a lot more extensive than what we can see

30:23.640 --> 30:29.240
 through our telescope. I think even most conservator astronomers would say that because we can see out

30:29.880 --> 30:36.360
 with our telescopes to a sort of horizon, which is about, depending on how you measure it,

30:36.360 --> 30:42.680
 when maybe 15 billion light years away or something like that. But that horizon of our observations

30:43.320 --> 30:48.280
 is no more physical reality than the horizon around you, if you're in the ocean.

30:49.480 --> 30:55.400
 And looking out at your horizon, there's no reason to think that the ocean ends just beyond your

30:55.400 --> 31:01.000
 horizon. And likewise, there's no reason to think that the aftermath of our Big Bang

31:01.000 --> 31:06.920
 ends just at the boundary of what we can see. Indeed, there are quite strong arguments

31:07.720 --> 31:12.600
 that it probably goes on about 100 times further. It may even go on so much further

31:13.240 --> 31:20.280
 that all combinatorials are replicated. And there's another set of people like us sitting in a room

31:20.280 --> 31:26.120
 like this. Every possible combination of... Yeah, that could happen. That's not logically

31:26.120 --> 31:34.760
 impossible. But I think many people would accept that it does go on and contain probably a million

31:34.760 --> 31:40.200
 times as much stuff as what we can see within the horizon. The reason for that, incidentally,

31:40.200 --> 31:44.040
 is that if we look as far as we can in one direction and in the opposite direction,

31:44.920 --> 31:50.360
 then the conditions don't differ by more than one part in 100,000. So that means that if we're

31:50.360 --> 31:56.280
 apart of some finite structure, the gradient across the part we can see is very small. And so

31:56.280 --> 32:01.560
 that suggests that it probably does go on a lot further. And the best estimates say it must go

32:01.560 --> 32:09.880
 on at least 20 times further. Is that exciting or terrifying to you? Just the spans of it all,

32:09.880 --> 32:17.320
 the wide, everything that lies beyond the horizon. That example doesn't even hold for Earth. So it

32:17.320 --> 32:23.240
 goes way, way farther. And on top of that, just to take your metaphor further on the ocean,

32:24.280 --> 32:28.600
 while we're on top of this ocean, not only can we now see beyond the horizon,

32:29.240 --> 32:36.280
 we also don't know much about the depth of the ocean, nor the actual mechanism of observation

32:36.280 --> 32:41.000
 that's in our head. Yes. No, I think the Ruggles and the Housers is on those points you make.

32:41.000 --> 32:51.000
 Yes. But I think even the solar system is pretty vast by human standards. And so I don't think

32:51.880 --> 33:00.040
 the perception of this utterly vast cosmos need have any deeper impact on us than just

33:00.040 --> 33:04.040
 realizing that we are very small on the scale of the external world.

33:04.040 --> 33:13.160
 Yeah. It's humbling, though. It's humbling in depending where your ego is. It's humbling.

33:13.160 --> 33:17.720
 Well, if you start off very unhumble, indeed, it may make a difference. But most of us,

33:17.720 --> 33:22.760
 I don't think it makes much difference. And, well, there's a more general question, of course,

33:22.760 --> 33:33.640
 about whether the human race as such is something which is very special, or if, on the other hand,

33:34.440 --> 33:42.120
 it's just one of many such species elsewhere in the universe, or indeed existing at different

33:42.120 --> 33:50.120
 times in our universe. To me, it feels almost obvious that the universe should be full of alien

33:50.120 --> 34:01.240
 life, perhaps dead alien civilizations, but just the vastness of space. And it just feels wrong

34:01.960 --> 34:05.960
 to think of Earth as somehow special. It sure as heck doesn't look that special.

34:06.840 --> 34:13.240
 The more we learn, the less special it seems. Well, I mean, I don't agree with that as far as

34:13.240 --> 34:18.840
 life is concerned. Because remember that we don't understand how life began here on Earth.

34:18.840 --> 34:23.400
 And we don't understand, although we know there are any evolutions from simple life

34:23.400 --> 34:30.120
 to complex life, we don't understand what caused the transition between complex chemistry

34:30.120 --> 34:36.040
 and the first replicating metabolizing entity we call alive. That's a mystery.

34:36.920 --> 34:44.200
 And serious physicists and chemists are now thinking about it, but we don't know.

34:44.200 --> 34:51.480
 So we therefore can't say, was it a rare fluke which would not have happened anywhere else,

34:51.480 --> 34:57.240
 or was it something which involves a process that would have happened in any other

34:57.240 --> 35:02.680
 planet where conditions were like they were on the young Earth? So we can't say that now.

35:03.800 --> 35:10.120
 I think many of us would indeed bet that probably some kind of life exists elsewhere.

35:10.120 --> 35:16.120
 But even if you accept that, then there are many contingencies going from simple life to

35:17.400 --> 35:23.800
 present day life. And some biologists like Stephen Jay Gould thought that if you rerun

35:23.800 --> 35:27.880
 evolution, you'd end up with something quite different, and maybe not with an intelligent

35:27.880 --> 35:34.840
 species. So the contingencies in evolution may militate against the emergence of intelligence,

35:34.840 --> 35:39.640
 even if life gets started in lots of places. So I think these are still completely open questions.

35:39.640 --> 35:44.280
 And that's why it's such an exciting time now that we are starting to be able to address these.

35:44.280 --> 35:50.120
 I mean, I mentioned the fact that the origin of life is a question that we may be able to

35:50.120 --> 35:55.480
 understand. And serious people are working on it. It's usually put in the sort of too difficult

35:55.480 --> 35:59.160
 box. Everyone knew it was important, but they didn't know how to tackle it or what experiments

35:59.160 --> 36:05.480
 to do. But it's not like that now. And that's partly because of cleverer experiments. But I

36:05.480 --> 36:11.640
 think most importantly, because we are aware that we can look for life in other places,

36:12.200 --> 36:19.080
 other places in our solar system, and of course, on the exoplanets around other stars. And within

36:19.080 --> 36:25.880
 10 or 20 years, I think two things could happen, which will be really, really important. We might,

36:25.880 --> 36:33.000
 with the next big telescope, be able to image some of the Earth like planets around other stars.

36:34.040 --> 36:40.360
 Image, like get a picture. Well, actually, let me caveat that. It takes 50 years to get a resolved

36:40.360 --> 36:47.080
 image, but to actually detect the light. Because now, of course, these exoplanets are detected by

36:47.080 --> 36:52.760
 their effects on the parent star. They either cause their parent star to dim slightly when they

36:52.760 --> 36:58.520
 transit across in front of it. And so we see the dips, or their gravitational pull makes

36:58.520 --> 37:05.240
 the star wobble a bit. So most of the 5,000 plus planets that have been found around other stars,

37:05.240 --> 37:09.320
 they've been found indirectly by their effect in one of those two ways on the parent star.

37:09.320 --> 37:14.040
 You could still do a pretty good job of estimating size, all those kinds of things.

37:14.040 --> 37:20.840
 The size and the mass, you can estimate. But detecting the actual light

37:20.840 --> 37:25.480
 from one of these exoplanets hasn't really been done yet, except in one or two very

37:26.680 --> 37:29.800
 bright, big planets. Maybe like James Webb Telescope would be.

37:29.800 --> 37:35.080
 Well, James Webb may do this, but even better will be the European ground based telescope

37:36.040 --> 37:41.560
 called, on the magic of the Extremilars Telescope, which has a 39 meter diameter mirror.

37:41.560 --> 37:48.600
 39 meters is the equivalent of Jesus Glass. And that will collect enough light from

37:48.600 --> 37:56.120
 one of these exoplanets around the nearby star to be able to separate out its light

37:56.680 --> 38:01.560
 from that of the star, which is a million times brighter, and get the spectrum of the planet

38:02.120 --> 38:07.560
 and see if it's got oxygen or chlorophyll and things in it. So that will come.

38:07.560 --> 38:15.400
 James Webb may make some steps there. But I think we can look forward to learning quite a bit

38:15.400 --> 38:21.640
 in the next 20 years, because I like to say, supposing that we're aliens looking at the solar

38:21.640 --> 38:28.120
 system, then they'd see the Sun as an ordinary star, they'd see the Earth as in Carl Sager's

38:28.120 --> 38:34.280
 nice phrase, a pale blue dot. I'm very close in the sky to its star, our Sun, and much,

38:34.280 --> 38:40.920
 much, much fainter. But if they could observe that dot, they could learn quite a bit. They could

38:40.920 --> 38:46.680
 perhaps get the spectrum of the light and find the atmosphere. They'd find the shade of blue

38:46.680 --> 38:51.800
 was slightly different, depending on whether the Pacific Ocean or the land mass of Asia was

38:51.800 --> 38:56.680
 facing them, so they could infer the length of the day and the ocean and continents,

38:56.680 --> 39:01.720
 and maybe something about the seasons and the climate. And that's the kind of

39:03.560 --> 39:08.760
 calculation under inference we might be able to draw within the next 10 or 20 years

39:08.760 --> 39:16.520
 about other exoplanets. And evidence of some sort of biosphere on one of them would, of course,

39:16.520 --> 39:22.120
 be crucial, and it would rule out the still logical possibilities that life is unique.

39:22.120 --> 39:26.120
 But there's another way in which this may happen in the next 20 years. People think there could be

39:26.120 --> 39:33.400
 something swimming under the ice of Europa and then Celadus and probes are being sent to maybe

39:33.400 --> 39:38.440
 not quite go under the ice, but detect the spray coming out to see if there's evidence for

39:38.440 --> 39:45.400
 organics in that. And if we found any evidence for an origin of life that happened

39:46.520 --> 39:50.600
 in either of those places, that would immediately be important, because if

39:51.480 --> 39:57.480
 life has originated twice independently in one planetary system, the solar system,

39:57.480 --> 40:01.560
 that would tell us straight away it wasn't a rare accident and must have happened

40:01.560 --> 40:08.040
 billions of times in the galaxy. At the moment, we can't rule out it being unique. And incidentally,

40:08.040 --> 40:11.880
 if we found life on Mars, then that would still be ambiguous because

40:12.840 --> 40:18.200
 people have realized that this early life could have got from Mars to Earth or vice versa on

40:18.200 --> 40:24.440
 meteorites. So if you found life on Mars, then some skeptics could still say if it was a single

40:24.440 --> 40:32.120
 origin. But I think Europe is far enough. That's far enough away. That's why that would be especially.

40:32.120 --> 40:38.280
 It's always the skeptics that ruin a good party. But we need them, of course.

40:38.280 --> 40:44.280
 We need them at the party. We need some skeptics at the party. But boy, would that be so exciting

40:44.280 --> 40:50.280
 to find life on one of the moons, because it means that life is everywhere.

40:50.840 --> 40:57.240
 That'll just be any kind of vegetation or life. The question of the aliens of science fiction

40:57.240 --> 41:04.680
 is a different matter. Intelligent aliens. But if you have a good indication that there's life

41:04.680 --> 41:14.200
 elsewhere in the solar system, that means life is everywhere. I don't know if that's terrifying

41:14.200 --> 41:21.240
 or what that is, because if life is everywhere, why is intelligent life not everywhere? You've

41:21.240 --> 41:28.440
 talked about that most likely alien civilizations, if they are out there, they would likely be far

41:28.440 --> 41:38.280
 ahead of us, the ones that would actually communicate with us. And that, again, one of those things

41:38.280 --> 41:43.640
 that is both exciting and terrifying. You've mentioned that they're likely not to be of biological

41:43.640 --> 41:50.840
 nature. Well, I think that's important. Of course, again, it's a speculation, but in speculating about

41:51.800 --> 41:59.160
 intelligent life. And I take the search seriously. In fact, I chair the committee that the Russian

41:59.160 --> 42:05.240
 American investor Yuri Milner supports looking for intelligent life. He's putting $10 million

42:05.880 --> 42:11.160
 a year into better equipment and getting time on telescopes to do this. And so I think it's

42:11.160 --> 42:17.400
 worthwhile, even though I don't hold my breath for success. It's very exciting. But that does

42:18.040 --> 42:24.600
 lead me to wonder what might be detected. And I think, well, we don't know. We've got to be

42:24.600 --> 42:28.840
 mindful about anything. We've no idea what it will be. And so any anomalous objects,

42:28.840 --> 42:34.040
 or even some strange shiny objects in the solar system or anything, we've got to keep our eyes

42:34.040 --> 42:44.040
 open for. But I think if we ask what about a planet like the Earth where evolution had taken

42:44.040 --> 42:50.840
 more of the same track, then as you say, it wouldn't be synchronized. If it had lagged behind,

42:50.840 --> 42:57.880
 then of course, it would not have got to advanced life. But it may have had a head start. It may

42:57.880 --> 43:05.000
 have formed on a planet around an older star. But then let's ask what we would see. It's taken

43:05.000 --> 43:09.960
 nearly four billion years from the first life to us. And we've now got this technological

43:09.960 --> 43:20.760
 civilization, which could make itself detectable to any alien life, aliens out there. But I think

43:20.760 --> 43:27.720
 most people would say that this civilization of flesh and blood creatures in the collective

43:27.720 --> 43:34.120
 civilization may not last more than a few hundred years more. I think that the bad people may,

43:34.120 --> 43:40.920
 some people would say it will kill itself off. But I'm more optimistic. And I would say

43:41.560 --> 43:48.840
 that what we're going to have in future is no longer the slow Darwinian selection,

43:48.840 --> 43:56.520
 but we're going to have what I call secular intelligence design, which will be humans designing

43:58.760 --> 44:06.280
 their progeny to be better adapted to where they are. And if they go to Mars or somewhere,

44:06.280 --> 44:13.160
 they're badly adapted, they want to adapt a lot. And so they will adapt. But there may be some

44:13.160 --> 44:19.160
 limits to what could be done with flesh and blood. And so they may become largely electronic,

44:20.840 --> 44:25.080
 download their brains and be electronic entities. And if they're electronic,

44:26.520 --> 44:33.800
 then what's important is that they're near immortal. And also, they won't necessarily want to be on a

44:33.800 --> 44:39.080
 planet with an atmosphere or gravity. They may go off into the blue yonder. And if they're near

44:39.080 --> 44:48.040
 immortal, they won't be daunted by interstellar travel taking a long time. And so if we looked

44:48.040 --> 44:55.080
 at what would happen on the earth in the next millions of years, then there may be these

44:55.080 --> 45:00.200
 electronic entities which have been sent out and are now far away from the earth,

45:00.760 --> 45:08.280
 but still sort of burping away in some fashion to be detected. And so this therefore leads me to

45:08.280 --> 45:15.400
 think that if there was another planet which had evolved like the earth and was ahead of us,

45:16.840 --> 45:20.680
 it wouldn't be synchronized. So we wouldn't see a flesh and blood civilization,

45:20.680 --> 45:27.400
 but we would see these electronic progeny as it were. And then this raises another question,

45:27.400 --> 45:35.240
 because there's the famous argument against there being lots of aliens out there, which is that they

45:35.240 --> 45:43.000
 would come and invade us and eat us or something like that. That's a common idea, which is fairly

45:43.000 --> 45:50.200
 is attributed to have been the first to say. And I think there's a escape clause to that because

45:50.200 --> 45:58.600
 these entities would be evolved by second intelligence design, designed by their predecessors

45:58.600 --> 46:07.320
 and then designed by us. Whereas Darwinian selection requires two things. It requires

46:07.320 --> 46:15.640
 aggression and intelligence. This future intel design may favor intelligence because that's

46:15.640 --> 46:21.640
 what they were designed for, but it may not favor aggression. And so these future entities, they

46:21.640 --> 46:29.960
 may be sitting deep thoughts, thinking deep thoughts and not being a tall expansionist. So

46:29.960 --> 46:36.600
 they could be out there. And we can't refute their existence in the way the Fermi paradox is

46:36.600 --> 46:41.960
 supposed to refute their existence because these would not be aggressive or expansionist.

46:41.960 --> 46:47.560
 Well, maybe evolution requires competition, not aggression. And I wonder if competition can take

46:47.560 --> 46:53.720
 forms that are non expansionary. So you can still have fun competing in the space of ideas,

46:54.440 --> 47:03.880
 which may be primarily philosophical, perhaps, in a way, right. It's an intellectual exercise

47:03.880 --> 47:12.440
 versus a sort of violent exercise. So what does this civilization on Mars look like? So do you

47:12.440 --> 47:18.440
 think we would more and more, you know, maybe start with some genetic modification and then

47:18.440 --> 47:25.080
 move to basically cyborgs, increasing integration of electronic systems, computational systems

47:25.080 --> 47:31.400
 into our bodies and brains? This is a theme of my other new book out this year, which is called

47:31.400 --> 47:38.600
 The End of Astronauts and co co written with my own friend and colleague from Berkeley,

47:38.600 --> 47:45.880
 Don Goldsmith. And it's really about the role of human spaceflight versus sort of robotic

47:45.880 --> 47:54.520
 spaceflight. And just to summarize what it says, it argues that the practical case for sending

47:54.520 --> 48:00.840
 humans into space is getting weaker all the time as robots get better and more capable.

48:01.560 --> 48:07.080
 Robots 50 years ago couldn't do anything very much. But now they could assemble big structures on

48:07.080 --> 48:16.280
 space or in space or on the moon, and they could probably do exploration. Well, present ones on

48:16.280 --> 48:24.040
 Mars can't actually do the geology, but future AI will be able to do the geology and already they

48:24.040 --> 48:31.480
 can dig on Mars. And so if you want to do exploration of Mars, and of course, even more of

48:31.480 --> 48:38.120
 Enceladus or Europa where you could never send humans, we depend on robots. And they're far,

48:38.120 --> 48:44.200
 far cheaper because to send a human to Mars requires feeding them for 200 days on the journey

48:44.200 --> 48:49.480
 there and bringing them back and neither of those are necessary for robots. So the practical case

48:50.040 --> 48:55.720
 for humans is getting very, very weak. And if humans go, it's only as an adventure, really.

48:55.720 --> 49:06.120
 And so the line in our book is that human spaceflight should not be pursued by NASA or public

49:06.120 --> 49:14.280
 funding agencies because it has no practical purpose, but also because it's especially

49:14.280 --> 49:21.400
 expensive if they do it because they would have to be risk averse in launching civilians into space.

49:21.400 --> 49:30.120
 I can illustrate that by noting that the shuttle was launched 135 times and it had two spectacular

49:30.120 --> 49:38.200
 failures, which each killed the seven people in the crew. And it had been mistakenly presented as

49:38.200 --> 49:43.640
 safe for civilians. And there was a woman's school teacher killed in one of them. It was a big

49:43.640 --> 49:51.800
 national trauma and they tried to make it safer still. But if you launch into space just the

49:51.800 --> 49:56.840
 kind of people prepared to accept that sort of risk, and of course test pilots and people who go

49:56.840 --> 50:04.360
 hang gliding and go to the South Pole, etc., are prepared to accept a 2% risk at least for a big

50:04.360 --> 50:12.120
 challenge, then of course you do it more cheaply. And that's why I think human spaceflight should

50:12.120 --> 50:20.920
 be left to the billionaires and their sponsors because then the taxpayers aren't paying and they

50:20.920 --> 50:29.160
 can launch simply those people who are prepared to accept high risks, space adventure, not space

50:29.160 --> 50:39.160
 tourism. And we should cheer them on. And as regards where they would go, then low earth orbit,

50:39.160 --> 50:45.880
 I suspect, can be done quite cheaply in the future. But going to Mars, which is very, very expensive

50:45.880 --> 50:55.080
 and dangerous for humans, the only people who would go would be these adventurers, maybe on one way

50:55.080 --> 51:00.360
 trip like some of the early polar explorers and Magellan and people like that, and we would cheer

51:00.360 --> 51:08.200
 them on. And I expect and I very much hope that by the end of the century there will be a small

51:08.200 --> 51:17.320
 community of such people on Mars living far less comfortably than at the South Pole or the bottom

51:17.320 --> 51:24.040
 of the ocean or the top of Everest, but they will be there and they won't have a return ticket,

51:24.600 --> 51:32.600
 but they'll be there. Incidentally, I think it's a dangerous illusion to think, as Elon Musk has

51:32.600 --> 51:40.040
 said, that we can have mass emigration from the earth to Mars to escape the earth's problems.

51:41.400 --> 51:46.200
 It's a dangerous illusion because it's far easier to deal with climate change on earth

51:47.000 --> 51:52.520
 than to terraform Mars to make it properly habitable to humans. So there's no planet

51:52.520 --> 51:57.160
 beef or ordinary risk of earth people. But for these crazy adventurers, then you can imagine

51:57.160 --> 52:04.600
 that they would be trying to live on Mars as great pioneers. And by the end of the century,

52:05.240 --> 52:11.240
 then there will be huge advances compared to the present in two things. First in understanding

52:11.240 --> 52:19.240
 genetics, so is to genetically redesign one's offspring. And secondly, to use cyborg techniques

52:19.240 --> 52:27.880
 to implant something in our brain or indeed think about downloading, etc. And those techniques will,

52:27.880 --> 52:33.800
 one hopes, be heavily regulated on earth, on potentials and ethical grounds. And of course,

52:33.800 --> 52:37.720
 we are pretty well adapted to the earth, so we don't have the incentive to do these things in

52:37.720 --> 52:46.680
 the way they were there. So our argument is that it'll be those crazy pioneers on Mars

52:46.680 --> 52:53.080
 using all these scientific advances, which would be controlled here, away from the regulators,

52:53.080 --> 53:00.760
 they will transition into a new post human species. And so if they do that, and if they

53:01.720 --> 53:06.920
 transition into something which is electronic, eventually, because there may be some limits

53:06.920 --> 53:13.960
 to the capacity of flesh and blood brains, anyway, then those electronic entities may not

53:13.960 --> 53:19.400
 want to stay on a planet like Mars, they may want to go go away. And so they'll be the precursors

53:19.400 --> 53:26.680
 of the future evolution of life and intelligence coming from the earth. And of course, there's

53:26.680 --> 53:33.160
 one point which perhaps astronomers are more aware of than most people. Most people are aware

53:33.160 --> 53:38.760
 that we are the outcome of four billion years of evolution. Most of them, nonetheless, probably

53:38.760 --> 53:47.080
 think that we humans are somehow the culmination, the top of the tree. But yes, no astronomers

53:47.080 --> 53:53.000
 can believe that because astronomers know that the earth is four and a half billion years old.

53:54.280 --> 53:59.560
 The sun has been shiny for that length of time, but the sun has got six billion years more to go

54:00.120 --> 54:04.280
 before it flares up and engulfs the inner planet. So the sun is less than halfway through its life.

54:04.280 --> 54:11.960
 And the expanding universe goes on far longer still, maybe forever. And I like to quote Woody Allen,

54:11.960 --> 54:18.840
 who said eternally is very long, especially towards the end. So we shouldn't think of ourselves as

54:18.840 --> 54:26.840
 maybe even a halfway stage in the emergence of cosmic complexity. And so these entities who are

54:26.840 --> 54:32.760
 post curses, they will go beyond the solar system. And of course, even if there's nothing else out

54:32.760 --> 54:40.600
 there already, then they could populate the rest of the galaxy. And maybe eventually meet the others

54:40.600 --> 54:48.520
 who are out there expanding as well, expanding and populating with expanded capacity for life

54:48.520 --> 54:55.480
 and intelligence, all those kinds of things. Well, they might, but again, all better off.

54:55.480 --> 55:03.000
 Because I can't conceive what they'd be like. They won't be green men and women with eyes on

55:03.000 --> 55:08.200
 stalks. They'd be something quite different. We just don't know. But there isn't anything

55:08.200 --> 55:12.520
 to question, actually, which comes up when I've sometimes spoken to audiences about this topic,

55:12.520 --> 55:17.720
 but the question of consciousness and self awareness. Because going back to philosophical

55:17.720 --> 55:26.680
 questions, whether an electronic robot would be a zombie, or would it be conscious and self aware?

55:27.320 --> 55:35.480
 And I think there's no way of answering this empirically. And some people think that consciousness

55:35.480 --> 55:39.960
 and self awareness is an emergent property in any sufficiently complicated networks that they

55:39.960 --> 55:45.000
 would be. Others say, well, maybe it's something special to the flesh and blood that we're made

55:45.000 --> 55:52.920
 of. We don't know. And in a sense, this may not matter to the way things behave, because they

55:52.920 --> 55:59.400
 could be zombies and still behave as though they were intelligent. But I remember after

55:59.400 --> 56:07.000
 one of my talks, someone came up and said, wouldn't it be sad if these future entities,

56:07.000 --> 56:11.720
 which were the main television universe, had no self awareness? So there was nothing

56:11.720 --> 56:17.880
 which could appreciate the wonder and mystery of the universe, and the beauty of the universe,

56:17.880 --> 56:25.480
 in the way that we do. And so it does perhaps affect one's perspective of whether you welcome

56:25.480 --> 56:31.320
 or deplore this possible future scenario, depending on whether you think the future

56:31.320 --> 56:37.240
 post human entities are conscious and have an aesthetic sense, or whether they're just zombies.

56:37.240 --> 56:46.120
 And of course, you have to be humble to realize that self awareness may not be the highest form

56:46.120 --> 56:53.880
 of being, that humans have a very strong ego and a very strong sense of identity,

56:54.520 --> 57:00.760
 like personal identity connected to this particular brain. It's not so obvious to me that that is

57:00.760 --> 57:10.760
 somehow the highest achievement of a life form, that maybe this kind of collective would be.

57:10.760 --> 57:16.120
 It's possible that, well, I think from an alien perspective, when you look at earth,

57:17.240 --> 57:24.120
 it's not so obvious to me that individual humans are the atoms of intelligence. It could be the

57:24.120 --> 57:28.760
 entire organism together, the collective intelligence. And so we humans think of ourselves

57:28.760 --> 57:33.720
 as individuals, we dress up, we wear ties and suits, and we'll give each other prizes. But in

57:33.720 --> 57:40.600
 reality, the intelligence, the things we create that are beautiful emerges from our interaction

57:40.600 --> 57:45.560
 with each other. And that may be where the intelligence is, ideas jumping from one person

57:45.560 --> 57:53.400
 to another over generations. Yes, but we have experiences where we can appreciate beauty and

57:53.400 --> 58:01.560
 wonder and all that. And a zombie may not have those experiences. Yeah, or it may have a very

58:01.560 --> 58:06.840
 different, they have a very black and white harsh description of like a philosophical zombie,

58:06.840 --> 58:10.040
 a zombie, that could be just a very different way to experience.

58:10.040 --> 58:24.360
 And, you know, in terms of the explorers that colonize Mars, I mean, there's several things

58:24.360 --> 58:29.560
 I want to mention. One, it's just at a high level to me, that's one of the most inspiring

58:29.560 --> 58:35.240
 things humans can do is reach out into the unknown. That's in the space of ideas,

58:35.240 --> 58:41.880
 in the space of science, but also the explorers. And that inspires people here on Earth more.

58:43.080 --> 58:48.040
 I mean, it did in their, you know, when going to the moon or going out to space in the 20th

58:48.040 --> 58:56.200
 century, that inspired a generation of scientists. I think that also could be used to inspire a

58:56.200 --> 59:02.040
 generation of new scientists in the 21st century by reaching out towards Mars. So in that sense,

59:02.040 --> 59:06.600
 I think what Elon Musk and others are doing is actually quite inspiring. It's not,

59:07.720 --> 59:14.760
 it's not a recreational thing. It's actually has a deep humanitarian purpose of really inspiring

59:14.760 --> 59:21.080
 the world. And then on the other one, to push back on your thought, you know, I don't think Elon says

59:23.080 --> 59:30.040
 we want to escape Earth's problems. It's more that we should allocate some small percentage

59:30.040 --> 59:38.200
 of resources to have a backup plan. And because you yourself have spoken about and written about

59:38.920 --> 59:46.280
 all the ways we clever humans can destroy ourselves. And I'm not sure it does seem,

59:46.280 --> 59:54.040
 when you look at the long arc of human history, it seems almost obvious that we need to become

59:54.040 --> 1:00:01.240
 multi planetary species over a period. If we are to survive many centuries, it seems that

1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:07.880
 as we get clever and clever with the ways we can destroy ourselves, Earth is going to become less

1:00:07.880 --> 1:00:17.000
 than less safe. So in that sense, this is one of the things, you know, people talk about climate

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:22.200
 change, and then we need to respond to climate change. And that's a long term investment we need

1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:28.280
 to make. But it's not really long term, it's a span of decades. I think what Elon is doing is

1:00:28.280 --> 1:00:34.680
 a really long term investment. We should be working on multi planetary colonization now,

1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:40.280
 if we were to have it ready five centuries from now. And so taking those early steps.

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.440
 And then also, there's something happens when you're caught when you

1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:51.240
 go into the unknown and do this really difficult thing, you discover something very new,

1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:55.880
 you discover something about robotics or materials engineering, or nutrition,

1:00:55.880 --> 1:01:01.160
 or neuroscience or human relations or political systems that actually work well with humans.

1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:08.280
 You discover all those things. And so it's a worthy effort to go out there and try to become

1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:14.520
 cyborgs. Yeah, no, I agree with that. I think the only different point I'd make is that

1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:22.920
 this is going to be very expensive, if it's done in a risk averse way. And that's why I think we

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:30.200
 should be grateful to the billionaires, if they're going to sort of foster these opportunities

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:35.480
 for thrill seeking risk takers who we can all admire.

1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:39.000
 Yeah. By the way, I should push back on the billionaires, because there's sometimes a

1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:43.000
 negative connotation to the word billionaire. It's not a billionaire, it's a company versus

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:49.320
 government, because governments are billionaires and trillionaires. It's not the wealth, it's the

1:01:49.320 --> 1:02:01.000
 capitalist imperative, which I think deserves a lot more praise than people are giving it.

1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:07.640
 I'm troubled by the sort of criticism like it's billionaires playing with toys for their own

1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:15.400
 pleasure. I think what some of these companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are doing is some

1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:22.120
 of the most inspiring engineering and even scientific work ever done in human history.

1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:28.200
 No, I agree. I think the people who've made the greatest wealth are people who've really been

1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:32.440
 mega benefactors. I mean, I think some of them, some of them.

1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:38.920
 Yes, some of them, but those who've founded Google and all that and even Amazon,

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:44.600
 they're beneficiaries. They're in a quite different category, in my view,

1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:51.720
 from those who just shuffle around money or crypto coins and things like that.

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:54.760
 But now you're really talking trash.

1:02:54.760 --> 1:03:01.960
 Yes, but I think if they use their money in these ways, that's fine, but I think it's

1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:06.040
 true that the far more money is owned by us collectively as taxpayers, but I think the

1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:15.000
 fact is that in a democracy, there'd be big resistance to exposing human beings to very high

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:21.160
 risks, if in a sense we share responsibility for it. That's the reason I think we've done much

1:03:21.160 --> 1:03:26.040
 more cheaply by these private funders. That's an interesting hypothesis,

1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:33.800
 but I have to push back. I don't know if it's obvious why NASA spends so much money and takes

1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:40.280
 such a long time to develop the things it was doing. Before Elon Musk came along,

1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:46.760
 because I would love to live in a world where government actually uses taxpayer money to get

1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:51.400
 some of the best engineers and scientists in the world and actually work across governments,

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:56.760
 Russia, China, United States, the European Union together to do some of these big projects,

1:03:56.760 --> 1:04:03.880
 it's strange that Elon is able to do this much cheaper, much faster. It could have to be

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:13.960
 due with risk aversion, you're right. I think it's that is that he had all the whole assembly

1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:18.840
 within this one building as it were rather than depending on a supply chain, but I think it's

1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:25.560
 also that he had a Silicon Valley culture and had younger people, whereas the big aerospace

1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:31.240
 companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, they had people who were left over from the Apollo program

1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:39.080
 in some cases, and so they weren't quite so lively. Indeed, quite apart from the controversial issues

1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:46.520
 of the future of human spaceflight, in terms of the next generation of big rockets, then the one

1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:53.480
 that Musk is going to launch for the first time this year, the huge one, is going to be far,

1:04:53.480 --> 1:05:00.760
 far cheaper than the one that NASA's been working on at the same time, and that's because it will

1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:09.160
 have a reusable first stage, and it's going to be great. It can launch over 100 tons into Earth orbit,

1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:14.280
 and it's going to be make it feasible to do things that I used to think were crazy,

1:05:14.280 --> 1:05:20.520
 like having solar energy from space. There's no longer so crazy if you can do that, and also

1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:31.000
 for science, because its nose cone could contain within it something as big as the entire unfurled

1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:37.480
 James Webb telescope mirror, and therefore you can have a big telescope much more cheaply if you

1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:43.480
 can launch it all in one piece, and so it's going to be hugely beneficial to science and to any

1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:49.240
 practical use of space to have these cheaper rockets that are far more completely reusable

1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:56.280
 than it was NASA had, so I think Musk's are a tremendous service to space exploration and

1:05:56.280 --> 1:06:03.160
 the whole space technology through these rockets, certainly. Plus, it's some big sexy rocket,

1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:07.640
 it's just great engineering. Of course, yeah. It's like looking at a beautiful big bridge

1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:12.920
 that humans are capable, us descendants of apes are capable to do something so majestic.

1:06:12.920 --> 1:06:17.880
 Yes, and also the way they land coming down this bar, that's amazing. It's both controls,

1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:25.240
 engineering, it's increasing intelligence in these rockets, but also great propulsion

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:32.120
 engineering materials, entrepreneurship, and it just inspires so many people.

1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:33.400
 No, I'm entirely with you on that.

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:40.680
 So would it be exciting to you to see a human being step foot on Mars in your lifetime?

1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:47.640
 Yes, I think it's unlikely in my lifetime since I'm so ancient, but I think this century is going

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:53.080
 to happen and I think that will indeed be exciting and I hope there will be a small

1:06:53.080 --> 1:07:00.040
 community by the end of a century. But as I say, I think they may go with one way tickets or

1:07:00.040 --> 1:07:08.280
 accepting the risk of no return. So they've got to be people like that and I still think it's going

1:07:08.280 --> 1:07:15.160
 to be hard to persuade the public to send people when you say straight out that they may never

1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:23.480
 come back. But of course the Apollo astronauts, they took a high risk and in fact in my previous

1:07:23.480 --> 1:07:30.680
 book I quote the speech that's been written for Nixon to be read out if Neil Armstrong got stuck

1:07:30.680 --> 1:07:39.480
 on the moon. And it was written by one of his advisors and very eloquent speech about

1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:47.240
 how they have come to a noble end, etc. But of course there was a genuine risk at that time.

1:07:48.680 --> 1:07:58.760
 But that may have been accepted, but clearly the crashes of the shuttle were not acceptable to the

1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:04.520
 American public even when they were told that this was only a 2% risk given how often they

1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:12.200
 launched it. And so that's what leads me to think that it's got to be left to the kind of

1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:19.240
 people who are prepared to take these risks. And I think of a mega adventure was a guy called

1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:25.640
 Steve Fossa, who was an aviator, did all kinds of crazy things, you know, and then a guy who fell

1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:33.320
 supersonicly with the parachute from very high altitude. All these people, we all share them on.

1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:39.800
 They extend the bounds of humanity. But I don't think the public will be so happy to fund them.

1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:45.240
 I mean, I disagree with that. I think if we change the narrative, we should change the story.

1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:45.720
 You think so?

1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:51.320
 I think there's a lot of people, because the public is happy to fund

1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:58.040
 folks in other domains that take bold, giant risks. First of all, military, for example.

1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:04.040
 Military, obviously, yes. I think this is in the name of science, especially if it's

1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:10.200
 sold correctly, I sure as hell would go up there with a risk. I would take a 40% chance risk of

1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:18.360
 death for something that's... I might want to be even older than them now, but then I would go.

1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:23.240
 I guess what I'm trying to communicate is there's a lot of people on earth that's the nice feature,

1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:27.640
 and I'm sure there's going to be a significant percentage or some percentage of people that

1:09:27.640 --> 1:09:37.320
 are... They take on the risk for the adventure. I particularly love that risk of adventure when

1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:42.200
 taking on inspires people, and just the ripple effect that has across the generation, especially

1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:53.560
 among the young minds, is perhaps immeasurable. But you're thinking that sending humans should

1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:58.920
 be something we do less and less, sending humans to space, that it should be primarily an effort...

1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:04.360
 The work of space exploration should be done primarily by robots.

1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:10.280
 Well, I think it can be done much more cheaply, obviously, on Mars, and no one's thinking of

1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:18.280
 sending humans to Enceladus or Europa, the outer planets. And the point is we'll have much better

1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:28.200
 robots, because let's take an example. You've seen the pictures of the moons of Saturn and the picture

1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:38.120
 of Pluto and the comet taken by probes and Cassini spent 13 years going around Saturn and its moons

1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:43.400
 after a seven year voyage. And those are all based on 1990s technology. And if you think of how

1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:49.240
 smartphones have advanced in 20 years since then, just think how much better one could do, instrumenting

1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:55.000
 some very small sophisticated probe that could send dozens of them to explore the outer planets.

1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:59.160
 And that's the way to do that, because no one thinks you could send humans that far.

1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:07.000
 And I would apply the same argument to Mars. And if you want to assemble big structures like,

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:11.560
 for instance, radio astronomers would like to have a big radio telescope on the far side of

1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:20.920
 the moon, so it's away from the Earth's background artificial radio waves. And that could be done

1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:30.200
 by assembling, using robots without people. So on the moon and on Mars, I think everything that's

1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:37.800
 useful can be done by machines much more cheaply than by humans. Do you know the movie 2001,

1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:43.400
 A Space Odyssey? Of course, yes. But you must be too young to have seen that when it came out,

1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:48.040
 obviously. I remember seeing it when it came out. You saw it when it came out.

1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:57.160
 Yeah, yeah, 50 years ago. 60, when was it? 60? In the 60s? Yeah, it's still classic.

1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:05.480
 It's still probably, for me, the greatest AI movie ever made. Yes, yes, I agree. One of the great

1:12:05.480 --> 1:12:11.480
 space movies ever made. So let me ask you a philosophical question since we're talking

1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:19.160
 about robots exploring space. Do you think how 9000 is good or bad? So for people who haven't

1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:30.120
 watched, this computer system makes a decision to basically prioritize the mission that the ship is

1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:37.400
 on over the humans that are part of the mission. Do you think how is good or evil?

1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:43.080
 If you ask me, probably in that context, it was probably good. But I think you're raising

1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:50.680
 what is, of course, very much an active issue in everyday life about the extent to which we should

1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:58.680
 entrust any important decision to a machine. And there again, I'm very worried because I think

1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:07.800
 if you are recommended for an operation or not given parole from prison, or even denied credit

1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:14.680
 by your bank, you feel you should be entitled to an explanation. It's not enough to be told that the

1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:21.560
 machine has a more reliable record on the whole than humans have of making these decisions. You

1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:27.240
 think you should be given reasons you could understand. And that's why I think the presence

1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:37.880
 of subtle trends to take away the humans and leave us in the hands of decisions that we can't contest

1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:44.520
 is a very dangerous one. I think we've got to be very careful of the extent to which AI,

1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:48.920
 which can handle lots of information, actually makes the decisions without oversight. And I think

1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:58.840
 we can use them as a supplement, but to take the case of radiology and cancer. I mean,

1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:07.960
 it's true that the radiologist hasn't seen as many x ways of cancer lungs as the machine.

1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:12.440
 So the machine can certainly help, but you want the human to make the final decision. And I think

1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:20.360
 that's true in most of these instances. But if we turn a bit to the short term concerns with robotics,

1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:27.560
 I think the big worry, of course, is the effect it has on people's self respect and their labor

1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:36.760
 market. And I think my solution will be that we should arrange to tax more heavily the big

1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:45.960
 international conglomerates, which use the robots and use that tax to fund

1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:55.400
 decently paid dignified posts of the kind where being a human being is important. Above all,

1:14:55.400 --> 1:15:00.760
 carers for old people, teachers, assistants for young, gardeners in public parks and things like

1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:07.320
 that. And if the people who are now working in mind numbing jobs in Amazon warehouses

1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:17.240
 or in telephone call centers are automated, but those same people are given jobs where being a

1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:24.600
 human is an asset, then that's a plus plus situation. And so that's the way I think that we

1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:33.640
 should benefit from these technologies, take over the mind numbing jobs and use machines to

1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:42.120
 make them more efficient, but enable the people so displaced to do jobs where we do want human

1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:47.960
 being. I mean, most people when they're old, the rich people, if they have the choice,

1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:52.440
 they want human carers and all that, don't they? They may want robots to help with some things,

1:15:52.440 --> 1:16:00.840
 MC to bedpans and things like that, but they want real people. And certainly in this country,

1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:07.560
 I think even worse in America, the care of old people is completely inadequate and it needs

1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:12.280
 just more human beings to help them cope with everyday life and look after them when they're

1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:20.200
 sick. And so that seems to me the way in which the money raised in tax from these big companies

1:16:20.200 --> 1:16:25.320
 should be deployed. So that's in the short term. But if you actually just look, the fact is where

1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:33.320
 we are today to long term future in 100 years, it does seem that there is some significant chance

1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:41.880
 that the human species is coming to an end in its pure biological form. There's going to be

1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:48.760
 greater and greater integration to genetic modification than cyborg type of creatures.

1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:52.920
 And so you have to think, all right, well, we're going to have to get from here to there.

1:16:53.720 --> 1:16:59.720
 And that process is going to be painful. And that, you know, how there's so many different

1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:05.320
 trajectories that take us from one place to another, it does seem that we need to deeply respect

1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:14.680
 humaneness and humanity, basic human rights, human welfare, like happiness and all that kind

1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:19.560
 of stuff. No, absolutely. And that's why I think we ought to try and slow down the application of

1:17:19.560 --> 1:17:25.160
 these human enhancement techniques and cyborg techniques for humans for just that reason.

1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:33.560
 I mean, that's why I want to lead into the people on Mars. Let them do it. But there are people too.

1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:39.560
 Okay. People on Mars are people too. I tend to, you know, but they are very poorly adapted to

1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:46.760
 where they are. That's why they need modification, whereas we're adapted to the earth quite well.

1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:52.200
 So we don't need these modifications. We're happy to be humans living in the environment

1:17:52.200 --> 1:17:57.000
 where our ancestors lived. So we don't have the same motive. So I think there's a difference.

1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:04.200
 But I agree, we don't want drastic changes probably in our lifestyle. And that indeed is a worry

1:18:04.200 --> 1:18:09.480
 because some things are changing so fast. But I think I'd like to inject a note of caution.

1:18:10.680 --> 1:18:16.600
 If you think of the way programs in one technology goes, it goes in a sort of

1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:23.640
 spurt. It goes up very fast and then it levels off. Let me give you two examples of one we've

1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:30.200
 had already, a human space flight at the time of the Apollo program. It was only 12 years after

1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:37.560
 Sputnik 1. I was alive then and I thought it would only be 10 or 20 years further before

1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:44.360
 the Earth would pretend Mars. But as we know, for reasons we could all understand, that was,

1:18:44.360 --> 1:18:51.240
 and still remains the high point of human space exploration. And that's because it was funded for

1:18:52.120 --> 1:18:57.560
 reason to superpower rivalry at huge public expense. But let me give you another case,

1:18:57.560 --> 1:19:06.040
 civil aviation. If you think of the change between 1919 when that was Alcock and Brown's

1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:12.280
 first transatlantic fight to 1979, the first flight to the jumbo jet was a big change.

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:17.880
 It's more than 50 years since 1969. And we still have jumbo jets more or less the same. So that's

1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:25.000
 an example of something which developed fast and to take another analogy, we've had huge

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:31.960
 developments in mobile phones. But I suspect the iPhone 24 may not be too different from

1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:40.920
 the iPhone 13. They develop, but then they saturate and then maybe some new innovation

1:19:40.920 --> 1:19:48.120
 takes over in stimulating economic growth. Yeah, so it's that we have to be cautious about being

1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:55.560
 too optimistic. And we have to be cautious about being too cynical. I think that is well, optimistic

1:19:55.560 --> 1:20:00.440
 is begging the question. I mean, do we want this very rough a change? Right. So first of all,

1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:05.640
 there's some degree to which technological advancement is something is a force that can't

1:20:05.640 --> 1:20:11.640
 be stopped. And so the question is about directing it versus stopping it or slowing it can be sort

1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:17.960
 of slot to slow what they human spaceflight that could be have been footprints on Mars if and if

1:20:17.960 --> 1:20:25.480
 America gone on spending 4% of the federal budget on the project after. Yes, by the reason. So it's

1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:32.840
 very good reasons, but and we could we could have had supersonic flight, but Concorde came

1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:40.600
 and went during the 50 years. But the reason it didn't progress is not because we realize it's not

1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:47.720
 good for human society. The reason it didn't progress is because it couldn't make sort of from

1:20:47.720 --> 1:20:53.640
 a capitalist perspective, it couldn't make there was no short term or long term way for it to make

1:20:53.640 --> 1:21:01.800
 money. So for me, but that's the same as saying it's local for society. I don't think everything

1:21:01.800 --> 1:21:06.280
 that makes money is good for society and everything that doesn't make money is bad for society,

1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:11.880
 right? That's a that's a difficult, that's a difficult thing we're always contending with

1:21:11.880 --> 1:21:17.240
 when we look at social networks. It's not obvious even though they make a tremendous amount of money

1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:21.880
 that they're good for society, especially how they're currently implemented with the advertisement

1:21:21.880 --> 1:21:28.200
 and engagement maximization. So that's the constant struggle of you know, I agree with you

1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:35.240
 that many innovations are damaging. Yes. Yes. Well, but I would have thought that supersonic

1:21:35.240 --> 1:21:42.360
 flight was something that would benefit only a tiny elite, huge expense and environmental damage.

1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:45.880
 That was obviously something which they're very glad not to have in my opinion.

1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:52.280
 Yeah. But perhaps there was a way to do it where it could benefit the general populace. If you were

1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:57.400
 to think about airplanes, wouldn't you think that in the early days, airplanes would have been seen

1:21:57.400 --> 1:22:04.600
 as something that can surely only benefit 1% at most of the population as opposed to a much

1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:10.200
 larger percentage. There's another aspect of capitalist system that's able to drive down

1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:15.720
 costs once you get the thing kind of going. So, you know, we get together maybe with taxpayer

1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:21.160
 money and get the thing going at first. And once it gets going, companies step up and drive down

1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:27.160
 the cost and actually make it so that blue collar folks can actually start using this. Yeah. Sometimes

1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:34.680
 that does happen. That's good. Yeah. So, that's again the double S sword of human civilization

1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:41.080
 that some technology hurts us, some benefits us and we don't know ahead of time. We could just

1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:47.720
 do our best. There's a gap between what could be done and what we can actually decide to do.

1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:55.160
 Yes. In the term, you could push forward some developments faster than we do.

1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:59.800
 Let me ask you, in your book on the future prospects for humanity,

1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:05.960
 you imagine a time machine that allows you to send a tweet length message to scientists in the past

1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:12.360
 like the Newton. Yes. What tweet would you send? It's an interesting thought experiment. What

1:23:12.360 --> 1:23:17.640
 message would you send to Newton about what we know today? Well, I think he'd love to know

1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:23.640
 that there were planets around all the stars. He'd like to know that that would really blows

1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:28.200
 mind. He'd like to know that everything was made of atoms. He'd like to know that if he looked a

1:23:28.200 --> 1:23:37.560
 bit more carefully through his prisms and looked at light not just from the sun, but from some

1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:43.800
 flames, he might get the idea that different substances emitted light of different colors

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:50.120
 and he might have been twigged to discover some things that had to wait 200, 300 years.

1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:57.000
 Could have given him those clues, I think. It's fascinating to think, to look back

1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:03.160
 at how little he understood, people at that time understood about our world.

1:24:05.080 --> 1:24:10.520
 Yes. And certainly about the cosmos, because of course, well, if we think about astronomy,

1:24:10.520 --> 1:24:22.360
 then until about 1850, astronomy was a matter of the positions of how the stars and the planets

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:28.120
 moved around. Of course, that goes back a long way, but Newton understood why the planets moved

1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:36.280
 around in ellipses. But he didn't understand why the solar system was all in a plane, what we

1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:42.600
 call the ecliptic. And he didn't understand it. He didn't know what until the mid 19th century

1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:47.000
 what the stars are made of. We thought we made it some fifth essence, not earth, earth,

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:53.960
 and water like everything else. And it was only after 1850 when people did use prisms

1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:59.800
 more precisely to get spectra that they realized that the sun was made of the same

1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:07.480
 stuff as the earth, and indeed the stars were. And it wasn't until 1930 that people

1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:14.040
 knew about nuclear energy and knew what kept the sun shining for so long. So it was quite late

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:19.240
 that some of these key ideas came in, which would have completely transformed Newton's views,

1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:25.800
 and of course, the entire scale of the galaxy and the rest of the universe.

1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:30.840
 Just imagine what he would have thought about the Big Bang, or even just general relativity.

1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:41.320
 Him and Einstein talking for a couple of weeks. Would he be able to make sense of spacetime

1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:47.160
 and the curvature of spacetime? Well, I think given a quick course, I mean, he was sort of,

1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:55.560
 if one looks back, he was really a unique intellect in a way. And he said that he

1:25:56.280 --> 1:26:01.720
 thought better than everyone else by thinking on things continually and thinking very deep

1:26:01.720 --> 1:26:07.560
 thoughts. And so he was an utterly remarkable intellect, obviously. But of course, scientists

1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:11.160
 aren't all like that. I think it's one thing that's interesting to me, having spent a life

1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:20.520
 amongst scientists is what a variety of mindsets and mental styles they have. And well, just to

1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:31.160
 contrast Newton and Darwin, Darwin said, and he's probably correct, that he thought he just had

1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:38.760
 as much sort of a common sense and reasoning power as he had with his lawyer. And that's probably

1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:45.080
 true because his ability was to sort of connect data and think through things deeply. That's

1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:50.600
 a quite different kind of thinking from what was involved in Newton or someone doing abstract

1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:57.880
 mathematics. I think in the 20th century, the coolest, well, there's the theory, but

1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:08.360
 from an astronomy perspective, black holes is one of the most fascinating entities to have been

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:12.280
 through theory and through experiment to have emerged from.

1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:19.080
 Obviously, I agree. It's an amazing story that, well, of course, what's interesting is Einstein's

1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:24.840
 reaction because, as you know, we now accept this is one of the most remarkable predictions of

1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:31.720
 Einstein's theory. He never took it seriously, even believed it. Although it was a consequence of

1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:38.280
 a series of his equations, which someone discovered just a year off his theory, Swordsfield,

1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:46.600
 but he never took it seriously and others did. But then, of course, well, this is something

1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:50.280
 that I've been involved in, actually finding evidence for black holes. And that's come in

1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:56.840
 the last 50 years. And so now there's pretty compelling evidence that they exist as the

1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:04.680
 remnants of stars or big ones in the center of galaxies. And we understand what's going on.

1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:12.360
 We have ideas vaguely on how they form. And, of course, gravitation waves have been detected.

1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:14.280
 And that's an amazing piece of technology.

1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:18.280
 LIGO is one of the most incredible engineering efforts of all time.

1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:23.480
 That's an example where the engineers deserve the most of the credit because the precision is,

1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:29.000
 as they said, it's like measuring the thickness of a hair at the distance of Alpha Centauri.

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:30.360
 Yeah, it's incredible.

1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:31.480
 Tens of miles 21.

1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:36.280
 So maybe actually, if we step back, what are black holes? What do we humans understand about

1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:39.640
 black holes? And what's still unknown?

1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:47.160
 Einstein's theory, extended by people like Roger Penrose, tells us that black holes are,

1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:54.120
 in a sense, one of the simple things, basically, because they are solutions to Einstein's equations.

1:28:54.920 --> 1:29:02.120
 And the thing that was shown in the 1960s by Roger Penrose in particular, and by a few other people,

1:29:02.120 --> 1:29:09.240
 was that a black hole, when it forms and settles down, is defined just by two quantities. It's

1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:14.680
 mass and it's spin. So they're actually based standardized objects. It's amazing that objects

1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:22.120
 as standardized as that can be so big and can lurk in the vessel solar system. And so that's

1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:28.360
 the situation for a ready formed black hole. But the way they form, obviously, is very messy and

1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:36.920
 complicated. And one of the things that I've worked on a lot is what the phenomena are,

1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:41.640
 which are best attributed to black holes and what may lead to them and all that.

1:29:41.640 --> 1:29:47.720
 Which, can you explain to that? So what are the different phenomena that lead to a black hole?

1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:49.880
 Let's talk about it. This is so cool.

1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:59.240
 Okay. Well, I mean, I think one thing that only became understood really in the 1950s, I suppose,

1:29:59.240 --> 1:30:07.160
 and beyond was how stars evolve differently depending on how heavy they are. This is the sun

1:30:07.160 --> 1:30:13.640
 burns hydrogen to helium. And then when it's run out of that, it contracts to be a white dwarf.

1:30:13.640 --> 1:30:18.120
 And we know how long that will take, say about 10 billion years altogether for its lifetime.

1:30:18.680 --> 1:30:24.520
 But big stars burn up their fuel more quickly and more interestingly, because when they've

1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:29.800
 turned hydrogen to helium, they then get even hotter. So they confuse helium into carbon

1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:36.200
 and go up the periodic table. And then they eventually explode when they have an energy crisis

1:30:36.200 --> 1:30:41.080
 and they blow out that process material, which as a digression is crucially important because

1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:49.240
 all the atoms inside our bodies were synthesized inside a star, a star that lived and died more

1:30:49.240 --> 1:30:55.000
 than 5 billion years ago before our services informed. And so we each have inside us atoms made

1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:59.240
 in thousands of different stars all over the Milky Way. And that's an amazing idea. And my

1:30:59.240 --> 1:31:04.600
 predecessor Fred Hoyle in 1946 was the first person to suggest that idea. And that's been

1:31:04.600 --> 1:31:11.640
 borne out. That's a wonderful idea. So that's how massive stars explode. And they leave behind

1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:18.760
 something which is very exotic and of two kinds. One possibility is a neutron star.

1:31:18.760 --> 1:31:25.400
 And these were first discovered in 1967, 68. These are stars a bit heavier than the sun,

1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:32.680
 which are compressed to an amazing density. So the whole mass of more than the sun's mass

1:31:32.680 --> 1:31:40.600
 is in something about 10 miles across. So they're extraordinarily dense. They're exotic physics.

1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:50.040
 And they've been studied in immense detail. And they've been real laboratories because the good

1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:54.760
 thing about astronomy, apart from exploring what's out there, is to use the fact that the

1:31:54.760 --> 1:31:59.480
 cosmos has provided us with a lab with far more extreme conditions than we could ever

1:31:59.480 --> 1:32:03.880
 simulate. And so we learn lots of basic physics from looking at these objects. And that's been

1:32:03.880 --> 1:32:10.200
 true of neutron stars. But for black holes, that's even more true because the bigger stars,

1:32:10.920 --> 1:32:16.840
 when they collapse, they leave something behind in the center, which is too big to be a stable white

1:32:16.840 --> 1:32:22.440
 two or four neutron star becomes a black hole. And we know that there are lots of black holes weighing

1:32:22.440 --> 1:32:30.760
 about 10 or up to 50 times as much as the sun, which are the remnants of stars. They were detected

1:32:30.760 --> 1:32:37.400
 first 50 years ago, when a black hole was orbiting around another star and grabbing

1:32:37.400 --> 1:32:43.800
 material from the other star, which swirled into it and gave us X ray. So the X rays astronomers

1:32:43.800 --> 1:32:53.000
 found these objects orbiting around an ordinary star and emitting X ray radiation very intensely,

1:32:53.640 --> 1:32:58.680
 varying out of a short time scale. So something very small and dense was giving that radiation.

1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:03.000
 That was the first evidence for black holes. But then the other thing that's happened was

1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:08.680
 realizing that there was a different class of monster black holes in the center of galaxies.

1:33:08.680 --> 1:33:13.640
 And these are a response for what's called quasars, which is when

1:33:14.840 --> 1:33:19.880
 something in the center of a galaxy is grabbing some fuel and outshines all the

1:33:20.760 --> 1:33:26.680
 100 billion stars or so in the rest of the galaxy. A giant beam of light. And in many

1:33:26.680 --> 1:33:33.320
 cases, it should be, it should be. Is that that's gotta be the most epic thing the universe produces

1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:40.600
 quasars? Well, it's a debate about the most epic, but quasars maybe or maybe gamma ray bursts or

1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:45.880
 something. But they are remarkable. And they were a mystery for a long time. And they're

1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:50.600
 one of the things I worked on in my younger days. So even though they're so bright, they're still

1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:56.280
 a mystery. And I wouldn't say they're a little mystery now. I think we do understand basically

1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:03.000
 what's going on. How were quasars discovered? Well, they were discovered when astronomers

1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:08.440
 found things that looked like stars and they were small enough to be a point like and not resolved

1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:18.600
 by a telescope, but outshone an entire galaxy. Yeah. And that's suspicious. Yes. But then they

1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:27.080
 realized that what they were, they were object which you now know are black holes. And they were

1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:33.800
 black holes were capturing gas. And that gas was getting very hot. But it was producing

1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.040
 far more energy than all the stars added together. And it was the energy of the

1:34:41.560 --> 1:34:46.840
 black hole that was lighting up all the gas in the galaxy. So you've got a spectrum of it.

1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:55.240
 So this was something which was realized from 1970s onwards. And as you say, the other thing

1:34:55.240 --> 1:35:01.480
 we've learned is that they often do produce these jets squirting out, which could be detected in

1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:09.320
 in all wave bands. So there's now a picture black hole generating jets like the center of most

1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:17.080
 galaxies. Do we know? Do we have a sense if every galaxy has one of these big, big boys?

1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:23.800
 Well, most galaxies have big black holes. They vary in size. The one in our galactic center.

1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:31.800
 Do we know much about ours? We do, yes. We know it weighs about as much as four million

1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:38.440
 suns, which is less than some, it's a several billion other galaxies. And but we know this

1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:45.080
 the one in our galactic center isn't very bright or conspicuous. And that's because not much is

1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:50.440
 falling into it at the moment. If a black hole is isolated, then of course it doesn't radiate. It only

1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:57.480
 all that radiates is gas swirling into it, which is very hot or has magnetic fields.

1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:01.800
 It's only radiating the thing it's murdering or consuming or however you put it.

1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:06.600
 Yeah, that's right. And so it's thought that our galaxy may have been bright,

1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:13.720
 bright at some time in the past. But now, and that's when the black hole formed or grew. But

1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:22.440
 now it's not catching very much gas. And so it's rather it's rather faint and detected indirectly

1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:27.560
 and by fairly weak radio emission. And so I think the answer to your question is that

1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:34.920
 we suspect that most galaxies have a black hole in them. So that means that some stays in their

1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:40.840
 lives, or maybe one or more stages, they went through a phase of being like a quasar where

1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:47.320
 that black hole captured gas and became very, very bright. But for the rest of the lives,

1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:52.280
 the black holes are fairly quiescent because there's not much gas falling into them.

1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:58.680
 And so this universe of ours sprinkled a bunch of galaxies and giant black holes with

1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:08.440
 like very large number of stars orbiting these black holes and then planets orbiting.

1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:13.640
 And that's right. And just this beautiful universe of ours. So what happens when galaxies collide,

1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:19.160
 when these two big black holes collide? Is that? Yes. Well, what would happen is that well,

1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:24.360
 and I should say that this is going to happen near us one day, but not for four billion years,

1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:28.200
 because the Andromeda galaxy, which is the biggest scan of the galaxy,

1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:35.000
 is going to be the biggest scan of the galaxy. And it's going to be the biggest scan of the galaxy.

1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:40.600
 Four billion years, because the Andromeda galaxy, which is the biggest galaxy near to us, which is

1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:47.160
 about three million light years away, which is a big disk galaxy with a black hole in its hub,

1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:54.280
 rather like our Milky Way. And that's in falling towards us because they're both in a

1:37:54.280 --> 1:38:00.440
 common gravitational potential well. And that will collide with our galaxy in about four billion

1:38:00.440 --> 1:38:05.880
 years. But it'll be maybe it'll be a lesser collision and more of a dance because it'll be

1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:11.000
 like a swirling situation. Well, it's a swirling, but eventually there'll be a merger. They'll

1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:17.320
 go through each other and then merge. In fact, the nice move is to be made of this computer

1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:27.080
 simulations and it'll go through. And then there's a black hole in the sense of Andromeda and our

1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:36.120
 galaxy. And the black holes will settle towards the center. Then they will orbit around each other

1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:41.000
 very fast and then they will eventually merge. And that will produce a big burst of gravitational

1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:47.400
 waves, a very big burst. That an alien civilization with a LIGO like detector will be able to detect.

1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:53.720
 Yes. Well, in fact, we can detect these with their lower frequencies than the

1:38:53.720 --> 1:39:00.840
 ways that have been detected by LIGO. So there's a space interferometer which can detect these.

1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:06.280
 It's about one cycle per hour rather than about a hundred cycles per second. Yes.

1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:12.440
 It's the ones that are detected. But that will happen. But thinking back to what will happen

1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:20.120
 in four billion years to any of our descendants, they'll be okay because the two disk galaxies

1:39:20.120 --> 1:39:26.760
 will merge. It'll end up as a sort of amorphous elliptical galaxy. But the stars won't be much

1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:32.760
 closer together than they are now. It'll still be just twice as many stars in the structure,

1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:40.120
 almost as big. And so the chance of another star colliding with our sun would still be very small.

1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:45.080
 Yeah. Because there's actually a lot of space between stars and planets.

1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:49.240
 Yes. The chance of a star getting close enough to affect our solar systems orbit

1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:53.480
 is small and it won't change that very much. So you can be reassured.

1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:57.720
 A heck of a starry sky though. What would that look like?

1:39:57.720 --> 1:39:59.960
 Well, it won't make much difference even to that actually. It'll just be...

1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:05.560
 Wouldn't that look kind of beautiful when you're swirling or because it's swirling so slow?

1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:09.880
 Yeah, they're far away. So it'll be twice as many stars in the sky.

1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:12.360
 Yeah. But the pattern changes.

1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:17.240
 The pattern will change a bit and there won't be the Milky Way because the Milky Way

1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:23.320
 across the sky is because we are looking in the disc of our galaxy. And you lose that.

1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:30.120
 Because the disc will be so disrupted. And it'll be also the spherical distribution.

1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:34.920
 And of course, many galaxies are like that. And that's probably because they have been through

1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:39.960
 mergers of this kind. If we survive four billion years, we would likely be able to survive beyond

1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:48.360
 that. What's the other thing on the horizon for humans in terms of the sun burning out,

1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:54.280
 all those kinds of interesting cosmological threats to our civilization?

1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:58.920
 Well, I think on the cosmological time scale, because it won't be humans because

1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:05.400
 even the evolution has got no faster than Darwinian. And I would argue it will be faster than

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:11.720
 Darwinian in the future. Then we're thinking about six billion years before the sun dies.

1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:17.320
 So any entities watching the death of the sun, if they're still around, maybe it's different

1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:23.560
 much as we are from slime mold or something. And far more different still if they become

1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:28.680
 electronic. So on that time scale, we just can't predict anything. But I think going back to

1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:38.280
 the human time scale, then we've talked about whether there'll be people on Mars by the end of

1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:45.240
 a century. And even in these long perspectives, then indeed, this century is very special,

1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:51.000
 because it may see the transition between purely flesh and blood entities to those which are

1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:59.240
 sort of cyborgs. And that'll be an important transition in biology and complexity in this

1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:03.480
 century. But of course, the other importance, and this has been the theme of a couple of my older

1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:10.920
 books, is that this is the first century where one species, namely our species, has the future of

1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:19.240
 the planet in his hands. And that's because of two types of concerns. One is that there are more

1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:25.320
 of us where more demanding of energy and resources. And therefore we are for the first time,

1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:34.280
 changing the whole planet through climate change, loss of biodiversity and all those issues.

1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:38.040
 This has never happened in the past, because having enough humans have been much in power.

1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:45.000
 So this is an effect that's obviously is high on everyone's agenda now, and rightly so, because

1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:53.000
 we've got to ensure that we leave a heritage that isn't eroded or damaged to future generations.

1:42:53.720 --> 1:43:01.240
 And so that's one class of threats. But there's another thing that worries me, perhaps more than

1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:09.240
 many people seem to worry. And that's the threat of misuse of technology. And so this is particularly

1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:19.640
 because technologies empower even small groups of malevolent people or indeed, even careless people

1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:29.160
 to create some effect which could cascade globally. And to take an example, a dangerous

1:43:29.160 --> 1:43:39.720
 pathogen or pandemic. I mean, my worst nightmare is that there could be some small group that can

1:43:39.720 --> 1:43:46.680
 engineer a virus to make it more virulent or more transmissible than a natural virus. This is so

1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:51.160
 called gain of function experiments which were done on the flu virus 10 years ago and can be

1:43:51.160 --> 1:44:00.360
 done for others. And of course, we now know from COVID 19 that our world is so interconnected

1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:06.440
 that a disaster in one part of the world can't be confined to that part and we spread globally.

1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:12.840
 So it's possible for a few dissidents with expertise in biotech could create a global

1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:20.600
 catastrophe of that kind. And also, I think we need to worry about very large scale disruption by

1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:28.600
 cyber attacks. In fact, I quote in one of my books, a 2012 report from the American Pentagon

1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:37.080
 about the possibility of a state level cyber attack on the electricity grid in eastern United

1:44:37.080 --> 1:44:43.320
 States, which is it could happen. And it says at the end of this chapter that this would

1:44:43.320 --> 1:44:49.160
 merit a nuclear response. This is pretty scary possibility. That was 10 years ago. And I think

1:44:49.160 --> 1:44:55.720
 now what would have needed a state actor then could be done perhaps by a small group empowered

1:44:55.720 --> 1:45:04.840
 by AI. And so there's obviously been an arms race between the cyber criminals and the cyber

1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:10.440
 security people, not clear which side is winning. But the main point is that as we become more

1:45:10.440 --> 1:45:20.680
 dependent on more integrated systems, then we get more vulnerable. And as we have the knowledge,

1:45:21.240 --> 1:45:27.400
 then the misuse of that knowledge becomes more and more of a threat. And I say bio and cyber

1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:37.240
 are the two biggest concerns. And if we depend too much on AI and complex systems, then just

1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:43.080
 breakdowns, it may be that they break down. And even if it's an innocent breakdown, then it may be

1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:48.360
 pretty hard to mend it and just think how much worse the pandemic would have been if we'd lost

1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:53.480
 the internet in the middle of it. Because we depended more than ever for communication,

1:45:53.480 --> 1:45:59.800
 everything else on the internet and zooms and all that. And if that had broken down,

1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:05.240
 that would have made things far worse. And those are the kinds of threats that we I think need to

1:46:05.240 --> 1:46:12.280
 be more energized and politicians need to be more energized to minimize. And one of the things I've

1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:18.920
 been doing the last year, through being a member of our part of our parliament is sort of a, I

1:46:18.920 --> 1:46:24.760
 have to instigate a committee to think more on better preparedness for extreme technological

1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:31.400
 risks and things like that. So they're a big concern in my mind that we've got to make sure that we

1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:41.560
 can benefit from these advances but safely because the stakes are getting higher and the benefits

1:46:41.560 --> 1:46:47.160
 are getting great, as we know, huge benefits from computers, but also huge downsides as well.

1:46:47.720 --> 1:46:55.320
 And one of the things this war in Ukraine has shown, one of the most terrifying things outside

1:46:55.320 --> 1:47:06.520
 of the humanitarian crisis is that at least for me, I realized that the human capacity to initiate

1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:14.280
 nuclear war is greater than I thought. I thought the lessons of the past have been learned.

1:47:15.240 --> 1:47:21.560
 It seems that we hang on the brink of nuclear war with this conflict like every single day

1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:32.440
 where just one mistake or bad actor or the actual leaders of the particular nations launching a

1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:39.640
 nuclear strike and all hell breaks loose. So then adding to that picture cyber attacks and so on,

1:47:39.640 --> 1:47:45.400
 they can lead to confusion and chaos. And then out of that confusion,

1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:58.120
 calculations are made such that a nuclear weapon is launched and then you're talking about,

1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:07.480
 I mean, direct probably 60, 70% of humans on earth are dead instantly. And then the rest,

1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:14.840
 I mean, it's basically 99% of the human population is wiped out in the period of five years.

1:48:14.840 --> 1:48:19.560
 Well, it may not be that bad, but it will be a devastation for civilization, of course.

1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:24.040
 And of course, it will be quite right that this could happen very quickly because of

1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:34.600
 information coming in and there's hardly enough time for human collected and careful thought.

1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:39.560
 And there have been recorded cases of false alarms. There's everywhere,

1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:46.600
 where there have been suspected attacks from the other side and fortunately,

1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:51.240
 they've been realized to be false alarms, but this could happen. And there's a new

1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:55.800
 class of threats actually, which in our center in Cambridge, people are thinking about,

1:48:55.800 --> 1:49:06.120
 which is that the commander control system of the nuclear weapons and the submarine fleets and all

1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:12.920
 that is now more automated and could be subject to cyber attacks. And that's a new threat,

1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:22.280
 which didn't exist 30 years ago. And so I think, indeed, it's really a sort of scary world, I think.

1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:30.520
 And it's because things happen faster and human beings aren't in such direct and immediate control,

1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:36.520
 because so much is delegated to machines. And also because the world is so much more interconnected,

1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:45.000
 then some local event can cascade globally in a way it never could in the past and much faster.

1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:54.600
 Yeah, it's a double H sword because the interconnectedness brings a higher quality

1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:59.800
 of life across a lot of metrics. Yeah, it can do, but of course, there again,

1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:03.800
 I mean, if you think of supply chains where we get stuff from around the world,

1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:09.720
 then one lesson we've learned is that there's a trade off between resilience and efficiency and

1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:17.960
 it's resilient to have an inventory in stock and to depend on local supplies, whereas it's more

1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:26.920
 efficient to have long supply chains. But the risk there is that a break in one link in one chain

1:50:28.120 --> 1:50:33.160
 can screw up car production. And this has already happened in the pandemic. So there's a trade off.

1:50:33.160 --> 1:50:36.760
 And there are the examples. I mean, for instance, the other thing we learned was that

1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:43.480
 it may be efficient to have 95% of your hospital intensive care beds occupied all the time,

1:50:44.040 --> 1:50:49.560
 which has been the UK situation, where to do what the Germans do and always keep 20% of them free

1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:56.520
 for an emergency is really a sensible precaution. And so I think we've probably learned a lot of

1:50:56.520 --> 1:51:03.560
 lessons from COVID 19 and they would include rebalancing the trade off between resilience

1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:12.040
 and efficiency. Boy, the fact that COVID 19, a pandemic that could have been a lot, a lot worse,

1:51:12.760 --> 1:51:18.600
 brought the world to its knees anyway. It could be far worse in terms of its fatality rate or

1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:24.840
 something. Fatality rate, yeah. So the fact that that, I mean, it revealed so many flaws in our

1:51:24.840 --> 1:51:35.160
 human institutions. Yeah, yeah. Yes. And I think I'm rather pessimistic because I do worry about

1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:45.400
 the bad actor or the small group who can produce catastrophe. And if you imagine someone with

1:51:45.400 --> 1:51:50.360
 access to the kind of equipment that's available in university labs or industrial labs, and they

1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:58.040
 could create some dangerous pathogen, then even one such person is too many. And how can we stop

1:51:58.040 --> 1:52:04.120
 that? Because it's true that you can have regulations. I mean, academies are having meetings,

1:52:04.120 --> 1:52:10.600
 et cetera, about how to regulate these new biological experiments, et cetera, make them safe.

1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:18.200
 But even if you have all these regulations, then enforcing regulations is pretty hopeless. We can't

1:52:18.200 --> 1:52:24.840
 enforce the tax laws globally. We can't enforce the drug laws globally. And so similarly, we can't

1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:31.640
 readily enforce the laws against people doing these dangerous experiments, even if all the

1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:38.840
 governments say they should be prohibited. And so my line on this is that all nations are going to

1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:46.280
 face a big trade off between three things we value, freedom, security, and privacy.

1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:54.760
 And I think different nations will make that choice differently. The Chinese would give up

1:52:54.760 --> 1:53:06.520
 privacy and have more security, if not more liberty. But I think in our countries, I think we're

1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:10.360
 going to have to give up more privacy in the same way.

1:53:10.360 --> 1:53:17.560
 That's a really interesting trade off. But there's also something about human nature here, where

1:53:18.200 --> 1:53:24.120
 I personally believe that all humans are capable of good and evil. And there's some aspect to which

1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:34.760
 we can fight this by encouraging people, incentivizing people towards the better angels of their nature.

1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:42.920
 So in order for a small group of people to create, to engineer deadly pathogens, you have to have people

1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:51.000
 that for whatever trajectory took them in life wanting to do that kind of thing. And if we can

1:53:51.800 --> 1:54:00.600
 aggressively work on a world that sort of sees the beauty in everybody and encourages

1:54:00.600 --> 1:54:05.080
 the flourishing of everybody in terms of mental health, in terms of meaning, in terms of all those

1:54:05.080 --> 1:54:13.720
 kinds of things, that's one way to fight the development of weapons that can lead to atrocities.

1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:18.680
 Yes. And I completely agree with that and to reduce the reason why people feel embittered.

1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:24.840
 Yes. But of course, we've got a long way to go to do that, because if you look at the present world,

1:54:24.840 --> 1:54:32.840
 nearly everyone in Africa has reason to feel embittered, because their economic development

1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:38.840
 is lagging behind most of the rest of the world. And the prospects of getting out of the poverty trap

1:54:38.840 --> 1:54:45.080
 is rather bleak, especially if the population grows. Because for instance, they can't develop

1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:50.280
 like the Eastern Tigers by cheap manufacturing, because robots are taking that over, so that they

1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:58.040
 will naturally feel embittered by the inequality. And of course, what we need to have is some sort

1:54:58.040 --> 1:55:04.280
 of mega version of the Marshall Plan that helped Europe in the post World War II era

1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:10.280
 to enable Africa to develop. That will be not just an altruistic thing for Europe to do,

1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:18.360
 but in our interest. Because otherwise, those in Africa will feel massively disaffected.

1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:25.000
 And indeed, it's a manifestation of the excessive inequalities, the fact that the

1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.880
 2000 richest people in the world have enough money to double the income of the bottom billion.

1:55:30.600 --> 1:55:38.680
 And that's an indictment of the ethics of the world. And this is where my friend Stephen

1:55:38.680 --> 1:55:44.040
 Pinker and I have had some contact. We wrote joint articles on bio threats and all that.

1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:51.160
 But he writes these books being very optimistic about quoting figures about how

1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:56.520
 life expectancy has gone up, infant mortality has gone down,

1:55:56.520 --> 1:55:59.240
 literacy has gone up, and all those things. And he's quite right about that.

1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:02.040
 And so he says the world's getting better.

1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:05.320
 Do you disagree with your friends, Stephen Pinker?

1:56:06.280 --> 1:56:12.760
 Well, I mean, I agree with those facts. But I think he misses out parts of the picture,

1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:20.680
 because there's a new class of threats which hang over us now, which didn't hang over us in the past.

1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:25.880
 And I would also question whether we have collectively improved our ethics at all,

1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:30.680
 because let's think back to the Middle Ages. It's true that, as Pinker says,

1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:35.960
 the average person was in a more miserable state than they are today on average.

1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:43.720
 For all the reasons he quantifies, that's fine. But in the Middle Ages, there wasn't very much

1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:50.600
 that could have been done to improve people's lot in life because of lack of knowledge and lack

1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:56.440
 of science, etc. So the gap between the way the world was, which is pretty miserable,

1:56:56.440 --> 1:57:01.000
 and the way the world could have been, which wasn't all that much better, was fairly narrow.

1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:05.880
 Whereas now, the gap between the way the world is and the way the world could be

1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:16.120
 is far, far wider. And therefore, I think we are ethically more at fault in allowing this gap

1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:22.200
 to get wider than it was in medieval times. And so I would very much question and dispute

1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:27.000
 the idea that we are ethically in advance of our predecessors.

1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:34.520
 That's a lot of interesting hypotheses in there. It's a fascinating question of how much

1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:39.640
 is the size of that gap between the way the world is and the way the world could be

1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:45.000
 is a reflection of our ethics, or maybe sometimes it's just a reflection of a very large number of

1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:51.800
 people. Maybe it's a technical challenge too. It's not just one of our political systems.

1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:57.160
 Political systems. And we're trying to figure this thing out. There's a 20th century

1:57:57.880 --> 1:58:03.880
 tried this thing that sounded really good on paper of collective communism type of things,

1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:07.400
 and it turned out at least the way it was done there,

1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:13.400
 that leads to atrocities and the suffering and the murder of tens of millions of people.

1:58:13.400 --> 1:58:18.600
 Okay, so that didn't work. Let's try democracy. And that seems to have a lot of flaws,

1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:22.600
 but it seems to be the best thing we've got so far. So we're trying to figure this out

1:58:22.600 --> 1:58:28.120
 as our technologies become more and more powerful, have the capacity to do a lot of good to the world,

1:58:28.120 --> 1:58:33.400
 but also unfortunately have the capacity to destroy the entirety of the human civilization.

1:58:33.400 --> 1:58:41.720
 I think it's social media generally, which makes it harder to get a sort of moderate consensus,

1:58:41.720 --> 1:58:47.720
 because in the old days when people got their news filtered through responsible journalists

1:58:47.720 --> 1:58:54.440
 in this country, the BBC and the main newspapers, et cetera, they would muffle the crazy extremes.

1:58:54.440 --> 1:59:00.120
 Whereas now, of course, they're on the internet, and if you click on them, you get to the war

1:59:00.120 --> 1:59:05.800
 extreme. And so I think we are seeing a sort of dangerous polarization, which I think is going

1:59:05.800 --> 1:59:10.280
 to make all countries harder to govern. And that's something which I'm pessimistic about.

1:59:10.280 --> 1:59:15.320
 So to push back, it is true that brilliant people like you highlighting the limitations

1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:22.440
 of social media is making them realize the stakes and the failings of social media companies,

1:59:22.440 --> 1:59:26.520
 but at the same time, they're revealing the division. It's not like they're creating it,

1:59:26.520 --> 1:59:34.520
 they're revealing it in part. And so that puts a lot of, that puts the responsibility into the

1:59:34.520 --> 1:59:39.880
 hands of social media and the opportunity in the hands of social media to alleviate some of that

1:59:39.880 --> 1:59:47.480
 division. So it could in the long arc of human history result, so bringing some of those divisions

1:59:47.480 --> 1:59:53.880
 and the anger and the hatred to the surface, so that we can talk about it. And as opposed to

1:59:53.880 --> 1:59:57.800
 disproportionately promoting it, actually just surfacing it so we can get over it.

1:59:57.800 --> 2:00:02.600
 Well, you're assuming that the fat cats are more public spirited than the politicians.

2:00:02.600 --> 2:00:03.720
 And I'm not sure about that.

2:00:03.720 --> 2:00:10.520
 Yeah. I think there's a lot of money to be made in being publicly spirited. I think there's a

2:00:10.520 --> 2:00:15.800
 lot of money to be made in increasing the amount of love in the world, despite the sort of public

2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:22.520
 perception that all the social media companies heads are interested in doing is making money.

2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:30.280
 I think that may be true, but I just personally believe people being happy

2:00:30.280 --> 2:00:39.000
 is a hell of a good business model. And so making as many people happy, helping them flourish in a

2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:46.120
 long term way, that's a good way to make money. Well, I think guilt and shame are good motives

2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:52.600
 to make you behave better in future. That's my experience. From maybe in the political

2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:58.360
 perspective of certainness in this case. But it does make sense now that we can destroy ourselves

2:00:58.360 --> 2:01:04.840
 with nuclear weapons, with engineered pandemics and so on, that the aliens would show up.

2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:16.760
 That if I was the, had a leadership position, maybe as a scientist or otherwise in an alien

2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:23.480
 civilization, and I would come upon Earth, I would try to watch from a distance,

2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:33.320
 do not interfere. And I would start interfering when these life forms start becoming quite,

2:01:33.880 --> 2:01:39.960
 have the capacity to be destructive. And so, I mean, it is an interesting question when people

2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:44.360
 talk about UFO sightings and all those kinds of things that at least...

2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:46.600
 These are benign aliens you're thinking of.

2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:56.360
 Benign, yes. I mean, benign, almost curious, almost partially, as with all curiosity,

2:01:56.360 --> 2:02:01.160
 partially selfish to try to observe, is there something interesting about this particular

2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:07.080
 evolutionary system? Because I'm sure even to aliens, Earth is a curiosity.

2:02:07.080 --> 2:02:11.240
 Yeah. Well, it's in a very special stage, you know what I mean?

2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:12.680
 It's special. It's special. Perhaps a very short...

2:02:12.680 --> 2:02:17.720
 This century is very special among the 45 million centuries the Earth experienced already.

2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:23.400
 So, it is a very special time where they should be specially interested. But I think going back

2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:31.960
 to the politics, the other problem is getting people who have short term concerns to care about

2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:39.000
 the long term. By the long term, I now mean just looking 30 years or so ahead. I know people who've

2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:44.280
 been scientific advisors to governments and things, and they may make these points.

2:02:44.280 --> 2:02:48.120
 But of course, they don't have much traction because, as we know very well,

2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:52.760
 any politician has an urgent agenda of very worrying things to deal with. And so,

2:02:53.640 --> 2:03:01.000
 they aren't going to prioritize these issues which are longer term and less immediate and

2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:04.360
 don't just concern their constituents if they concern distant parts of the world.

2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:15.000
 And so, I think what we have to do is to enlist charismatic individuals

2:03:15.880 --> 2:03:20.680
 to convert the public. Because if the politicians know the public care about something,

2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:30.600
 climate change is an example, then they will make decisions which take cognizance of that.

2:03:30.600 --> 2:03:39.320
 And I think for that to happen, then we do need some public individuals who are respected by

2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:46.840
 everyone and to have a high profile. And in the climate context, I would say that I've mentioned

2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:52.680
 four very disparate people who've had such a big effect in the last few years. One is Pope Francis,

2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:57.480
 the other is David Attenborough, the other is Bill Gates, and the other is Greater Taunberg.

2:03:57.480 --> 2:04:03.720
 And those four people have certainly had a big shift in public opinion and

2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:09.320
 even changed the rhetoric of business, although how deep that is, I don't know.

2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:20.120
 But politicians can't let these issues drop down off the agenda if there's a public clamor.

2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:23.080
 And it needs people like that to keep the public clamor going.

2:04:23.080 --> 2:04:28.280
 To push back a little bit, so those four are very interesting and I have deep respect for them.

2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:34.120
 They have, except David Attenborough, David Attenborough is really, I mean, everybody loves him.

2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:41.080
 I mean, I can't say anything. But Bill Gates and Greta, they also create a lot of division.

2:04:41.080 --> 2:04:41.960
 Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.

2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:47.080
 And this is a big problem. So it's not just charismatic. I put that responsibility actually

2:04:47.080 --> 2:04:53.240
 on the scientific community. And the populace too, yeah. And the politicians. So we need

2:04:54.360 --> 2:05:01.000
 the charismatic leaders. And they're rare. When you look at human history,

2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:04.040
 those are the ones that make a difference. Those are the ones that

2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:16.280
 not the ride, they inspire the populace to think long term. The JFK, we'll go to the

2:05:16.280 --> 2:05:22.120
 moon in this decade now because it's easy, but because it is hard. There's no discussion about

2:05:25.320 --> 2:05:31.560
 short term political gains or any of that kind of stuff in the vision of going to the moon,

2:05:32.360 --> 2:05:39.240
 or going to Mars, or taking on gigantic projects, or taking on world hunger, or taking on climate

2:05:39.240 --> 2:05:46.280
 change, or the education system, all those things that require long term, significant investment

2:05:46.280 --> 2:05:51.240
 that requires. But it's hard to find those people. And incidentally, I think another problem,

2:05:52.120 --> 2:06:00.360
 which is a downside of social media is that of younger people, I know the number who would

2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:07.160
 contemplate a political career has gone down because of the pressures on them and their family

2:06:07.160 --> 2:06:14.120
 from social media. It's a hell of a job now. And so I think we are all losers because the

2:06:14.120 --> 2:06:24.200
 quality of people who choose that path is really dropping. And as we see by the quality of those

2:06:24.200 --> 2:06:29.960
 who are in these compositions. That said, I think the silver lining there is the quality of the

2:06:29.960 --> 2:06:38.760
 competition actually is inspiring because it shows to you that there's a dire need of leaders,

2:06:38.760 --> 2:06:43.320
 which I think would be inspiring to young people to step into the fold. I mean, great leaders

2:06:43.320 --> 2:06:50.520
 are not afraid of a little bit of fire on social media. So if you have a 20 year old kid now,

2:06:50.520 --> 2:06:57.240
 a 25 year old kid is seeing how the world responded to the pandemic, seeing the geopolitical

2:06:57.240 --> 2:07:02.120
 division over the war in Ukraine, seeing the brewing war between the West and China,

2:07:02.680 --> 2:07:08.840
 we need great leaders. And there's a hunger for them. And the time will come when they step up.

2:07:11.080 --> 2:07:16.040
 I believe that. But also to add to your list of four, he doesn't get enough credit. I've been

2:07:16.040 --> 2:07:20.680
 defending him in this conversation. Elon Musk in terms of the fight and climate change.

2:07:20.680 --> 2:07:25.880
 But he also has led to a lot of division, but we need more. David Edinburgh.

2:07:25.880 --> 2:07:32.920
 Yeah, no, I mean, I'm definitely, I mean, I've heard him described as a 21st century Brunel

2:07:32.920 --> 2:07:39.720
 for his innovation. And that's true. But whether he's an ethical inspiration, I don't know.

2:07:39.720 --> 2:07:47.800
 Yeah, he has a lot of fun on Twitter. Well, let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat.

2:07:47.800 --> 2:07:57.000
 What advice would you give to young people today? Maybe they're teenagers in high school, maybe

2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:05.400
 early college. What advice would you give to a career or have a life they can be proud of?

2:08:05.400 --> 2:08:14.680
 Yes. Well, I'd be very different, really, about offering any wisdom. But I think they should

2:08:14.680 --> 2:08:26.760
 they should realize that the choices they make at that time are important. And from the experience

2:08:26.760 --> 2:08:33.400
 of I've had with many friends, many people don't realize that opportunities are open until it's too

2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:38.600
 late. They somehow think that some opportunities are only open to a few privileged people. And

2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:48.760
 they don't even try. And that they could succeed. But if I focus on people working in some professor

2:08:48.760 --> 2:08:56.040
 I know about like science, I would say, pick an area to work in, where new things are happening,

2:08:57.320 --> 2:09:02.360
 where you can do something that the old guys never had a chance to think about.

2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:09.240
 Don't go into a field that's fairly stagnant, because then there's not much to do, or you'll be

2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:13.240
 trying to tackle the problems that the old guys got stuck on. And so I think in science,

2:09:14.360 --> 2:09:20.440
 I can give people good advice that they should pick a subject where there are exciting new

2:09:20.440 --> 2:09:25.720
 developments. And also, of course, something which suits their style, because even when in

2:09:25.720 --> 2:09:30.040
 science, which is just one profession, there's a big range of style between the sort of

2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:35.160
 solitary thinker that a person does field work, the person who works in a big team, etc. And

2:09:35.160 --> 2:09:42.680
 whether you like computing or mathematical thought, etc. So pick some subject that suits your style

2:09:42.680 --> 2:09:48.360
 and where things are happening fast. And be prepared to be flexible. That's what I'd say,

2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:53.320
 really. Keep your eyes open for the opportunity throughout, like you said. Go to a new field,

2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:57.560
 go to a field where new cool stuff is happening. Just keep your eyes open. Yes, that's

2:09:57.560 --> 2:10:03.000
 patitudinous. But I think most of us, and I include myself in this, didn't realize these

2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:12.280
 sorts of things are too late. Yeah, I think this applies way beyond science. What do you make of

2:10:12.280 --> 2:10:17.800
 this finiteness of our life? Do you think about death? Do you think about mortality?

2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:22.600
 Do you think about your mortality? And are you afraid of death? Well, I mean, I'm not afraid,

2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:29.640
 because I think I'm lucky. I feel lucky to have laughed as long as I have. And to have been

2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:36.760
 fairly lucky in my life in many respects compared to most people. So I feel very fortunate.

2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:45.720
 This reminds me of this current emphasis on living much longer than these so called

2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:53.720
 Altos laboratories, which have been set up by billionaires. There's one in San Francisco,

2:10:53.720 --> 2:11:02.760
 one in La Jolla, I think, and one in Cambridge. And they're funded by these guys who,

2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:07.160
 when young, wanted to be rich. And now they're rich, they want to be young again. They won't

2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:13.800
 find that quite so easy. And do we want this? I don't know if there was some elite that was able

2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:20.200
 to do much longer than others. That would be a really fundamental kind of inequality. And I think

2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:29.400
 if it happened to everyone, then that might be an improvement. It's not so obvious. But I think

2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:39.240
 for my part, I think to have lived as long as most people and had a fortunate life is all I can

2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:47.560
 expect and a lot to be grateful for. Those are all past issues. Well, I am incredibly honored

2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:53.480
 that you sit down with me today. I thank you so much for life of exploring some of the deepest

2:11:53.480 --> 2:11:59.080
 mysteries of our universe and of our humanity and thinking about our future with existential

2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:05.240
 risks that are before us. It's a huge honor, Martin, that you sit with me. And I've really

2:12:05.240 --> 2:12:09.880
 enjoyed it. Well, thank you, Lex. I thought we couldn't go on for as long as this, but we could

2:12:09.880 --> 2:12:15.960
 have gone on much longer. Exactly. Thank you so much. Thank you for listening to this conversation

2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:21.160
 with Martin Rees. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And

2:12:21.160 --> 2:12:26.760
 now let me leave you with some words for Martin Rees himself. I'd like to widen people's awareness

2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:33.720
 of the tremendous time span lying ahead for our planet and for life itself. Most educated people

2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:39.000
 are aware that we're the outcome of nearly four billion years of Darwinian selection,

2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:46.920
 but many tend to think that humans are somehow the culmination. Our sun, however,

2:12:46.920 --> 2:12:52.840
 is less than halfway through its lifespan. It will not be humans who watch the sun's demise

2:12:52.840 --> 2:13:00.120
 six billion years from now. Any creatures that then exist will be as different from us as we are

2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:16.040
 from bacteria or amoeba. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
