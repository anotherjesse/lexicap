00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 The following is a conversation with Commander David Fraver, who was a Navy

00:04.000 --> 00:09.840
 pilot for 18 years and commander of the Strike Fighter Squadron 41, also known as

00:09.840 --> 00:15.200
 the Black Aces, a squadron of 12 airplanes consisting of several hundred people.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.760
 He's also famously one of the people who with his own eyes

00:19.760 --> 00:26.720
 saw and chased a UFO, an identified flying object in 2004

00:26.720 --> 00:31.840
 that is referred to as the tic tac and the incident more formally referred to as

00:31.840 --> 00:38.400
 the USS Nimitz UFO incident. His story corroborated by several other pilots

00:38.400 --> 00:43.120
 from my perspective as a curious scientist and an open minded human being

00:43.120 --> 00:48.160
 is the most credible sighting of a UFO in history, at least that I'm aware of.

00:49.120 --> 00:55.120
 He's a humble, fascinating, and fun human being to talk to. I put out a call for questions

00:55.120 --> 00:58.960
 on Reddit and many other places and tried to ask as many of the questions that

00:58.960 --> 01:03.680
 people posted as I could. And overall I really enjoyed this conversation

01:03.680 --> 01:08.240
 and I'm sure if the world wants us to and if there's more questions to be had

01:08.240 --> 01:13.120
 we'll talk on this podcast again. Quick summary of the sponsors, Athletic Greens,

01:23.120 --> 01:29.040
 the world of UFOs and UAPs, unidentified aerial phenomena, and aliens in general,

01:29.040 --> 01:34.000
 is foreign to me because of the high ratio of outlandish conspiracy theorists

01:34.000 --> 01:40.400
 to actual hard evidence. I'm a scientist first and foremost but an open minded one,

01:40.400 --> 01:44.720
 often looking and thinking outside the box. I'm often disheartened by the closed

01:44.720 --> 01:50.240
 mindedness of the scientific community. And in equal part, I'm disheartened by

01:50.240 --> 01:54.480
 the lack of rigor and basic scientific inquiry and study on the part of the

01:54.480 --> 01:59.440
 conspiracy theorists. I believe there's a line somewhere between the two extremes

01:59.440 --> 02:05.520
 that, more inquisitive minds should walk. I think we humans know very little

02:05.520 --> 02:10.400
 about our world, what's up there among the stars, and the nature of reality,

02:10.400 --> 02:15.760
 and the nature of our very own minds. The path to understanding can only be

02:15.760 --> 02:21.280
 walked humbly. The very idea that there is a possibility that David witnessed a

02:21.280 --> 02:26.800
 piece of technology, whether human made or alien made, that moved in the way did,

02:26.800 --> 02:31.600
 should be inspiring to every scientist and engineer on this earth. There may be

02:31.600 --> 02:36.000
 propulsion and energy systems yet to be discovered that, once understood and

02:36.000 --> 02:41.840
 mastered, will put distant galaxies within reach of us human beings. Paradigm shifts

02:41.840 --> 02:47.120
 in science and leaps in understanding can only happen, I think, if we open our

02:47.120 --> 02:52.240
 eyes and allow ourselves to dream, to think from first principles, and remove

02:52.240 --> 02:56.160
 the constraints and innovation placed on us by the scientific conventions and

02:56.160 --> 03:00.960
 assumptions of prior generations. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on

 This show is brought to you by Athletic Greens, the all in one daily drink to

03:35.280 --> 03:39.280
 support health and performance. I drink it every day to make sure I'm not

03:39.280 --> 03:44.080
 missing any of the nutrition I need. Now, let me take a hard left turn and

03:44.080 --> 03:48.000
 talk about fasting. I fast often, sometimes intermittent

03:48.000 --> 03:52.800
 fasting of 16 hours and then an eight hour eating period of two meals,

03:52.800 --> 03:56.880
 sometimes 24 hours, that's one dinner to the next.

03:56.880 --> 04:01.440
 I've been even considering doing a 48 or 72 hour fast that some people I look up

04:01.440 --> 04:05.920
 to have done. People who have done it tell me that outside of weight loss and

04:05.920 --> 04:10.160
 the different health benefits, it's a chance to meditate on the finiteness of

04:10.160 --> 04:13.600
 life. Not eating somehow is a reminder that

04:13.600 --> 04:17.280
 we're immortal, that every day is precious. I certainly

04:17.280 --> 04:22.240
 experienced this with a 24 hour fast and I think it goes even deeper for the

04:22.240 --> 04:28.080
 48, 72 and even week long fasts. Anyway, I always break my fast with

04:28.080 --> 04:31.760

 You probably know there's a show called The Office that I fell in love with first

04:56.640 --> 05:00.560
 with the British version with Ricky Gervais and then the American version

05:00.560 --> 05:03.920
 with Steve Carell. ExpressVPN lets you pretend your

05:03.920 --> 05:08.080
 location is somewhere else, choosing from nearly 100 different countries

05:08.080 --> 05:11.600

05:11.600 --> 05:16.720
 Office and other countries. Also, it protects you when you do shady

05:16.720 --> 05:19.280
 things on the internet that you shouldn't be doing.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.200
 Like checking the website of this very podcast that for some reason

05:23.200 --> 05:27.040
 was not available in Russia for a long time, not sure if it still is,

05:27.040 --> 05:30.960
 but if it isn't, you can use ExpressVPN to access it.

05:30.960 --> 05:36.480
 I think of ExpressVPN like a pirate ship and regular VPN free life as a boring

05:36.480 --> 05:39.200
 cruise from one place to another with no

05:39.200 --> 05:42.960

 you can communicate by text anytime and schedule weekly audio and video

06:13.760 --> 06:17.280
 sessions. Now, hard left turn, let me talk about

06:17.280 --> 06:20.320
 Desert Islands. Whatever you think of it, I love the movie

06:20.320 --> 06:24.240
 Cast Away with Tom Hanks and the idea of spending time on an island

06:24.240 --> 06:29.360
 alone with potentially no hope. The natural question is, if I could, what

06:29.360 --> 06:33.280
 would I bring to this island? The answer is complicated, but let me pick

06:33.280 --> 06:36.240
 one thing, the first thing that popped into my

06:36.240 --> 06:39.760
 crazy mind, which is the Introduction to Algorithms book,

06:39.760 --> 06:44.720
 also called CLRS for the first letters of the last name of its four authors.

06:44.720 --> 06:49.280
 I find algorithms beautiful, like a little toolbox for a simple world inside

06:49.280 --> 06:52.320
 computers, when the real world outside is an

06:52.320 --> 06:56.080
 impossible, chaotic mess. I would love pondering the

06:56.080 --> 06:59.920
 puzzles in that book for months, far away from human civilization.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.760

07:07.680 --> 07:11.920
 And now, finally, here's my conversation with David

07:11.920 --> 07:17.840
 Fravor. You're a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapon School.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.200
 Yeah, I am. But are known as Top Gun.

07:21.200 --> 07:26.080
 Let me ask the most ridiculous question, how realistic is the movie Top Gun?

07:26.080 --> 07:29.600
 So it's funny, we used to joke and a friend of mine who was a Top Gun

07:29.600 --> 07:32.480
 instructor said this, there's two things in the

07:32.480 --> 07:36.080
 in the original Top Gun that are true, that are very realistic.

07:36.080 --> 07:40.320
 One, there is a place called Top Gun, and number two is

07:40.320 --> 07:45.680
 they do fly airplanes there. Other than that, you know, I went through

07:45.680 --> 07:50.720
 in 97, class 497. There's actually a log of every single

07:50.720 --> 07:53.520
 person that's went through, kind of like a SEAL training.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.400
 You know, there's a list. So people, because there's a lot of posers out there,

07:56.400 --> 08:00.160
 I was a Navy SEAL. No, you weren't. Well, I went to Top Gun. You can actually go to

08:00.160 --> 08:02.880
 Top Gun. And matter of fact, just to get a Top Gun patch,

08:02.880 --> 08:06.880
 the real patch, you have to have gone there.

08:06.880 --> 08:11.360
 So a lot of the patches you see running around are not real. There's

08:11.360 --> 08:14.720
 the real ones are controlled, the people that make them

08:14.720 --> 08:17.680
 honor that. And when you go in, they look up your name.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.920
 If you want to get one, they look up your name, you just tell them, they go,

08:19.920 --> 08:22.720
 okay, here, no solemnty. If you are not on the list,

08:22.720 --> 08:27.040
 you ain't getting no patch. Because it is, it's a pretty big deal

08:27.040 --> 08:32.240
 to go through. But it's, for me, probably one of the best experiences of

08:32.240 --> 08:36.000
 flying, because everyone there is extremely competent.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.360
 It's very, very challenging, but it's what we all signed up to do.

08:41.360 --> 08:46.880
 So it's, it's just the entire group that is, when you want to be that,

08:46.880 --> 08:51.520
 you know, that level, you know, where you go, everyone really cares. And everyone

08:51.520 --> 08:55.200
 really wants to be good. Is it competitive? Like, was it in the

08:55.200 --> 08:58.320
 movie? No, it's, when you go through, it's, you

08:58.320 --> 09:02.000
 know, it's, if anything, it's more of the students, you know, and then there's the

09:02.000 --> 09:04.560
 instructor side. And the instructor sides are really, you know,

09:04.560 --> 09:07.680
 they're guys that you know, they just chose to stay up and

09:07.680 --> 09:12.000
 fall in. And it's extremely difficult job,

09:12.000 --> 09:18.160
 because they have, they have a very small tolerance for

09:18.160 --> 09:22.720
 not being good. So they're brief, the guys, when they give a lecture. So

09:22.720 --> 09:25.600
 let's just say there's a fighter employment lecture, which is one of the

09:25.600 --> 09:29.840
 hardest ones. It takes about two days to give the fighter employment lecture.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.120
 The guy who gives the lecture goes through multiple, they call them murder

09:33.120 --> 09:36.000
 boards, where he's scrutinized by his peers and he practices.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.280
 By the time they actually stand in front of a class,

09:39.280 --> 09:43.280
 they pretty much have their 250 PowerPoint slides memorized,

09:43.280 --> 09:46.480
 and they don't even turn around. They just click and they know them in order.

09:46.480 --> 09:50.560
 And they repeat the same thing over. It's, and it's standardized.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.280
 So they are extremely, extremely standardized when you go through the

09:53.280 --> 09:56.240
 school. And there's a reason for that, because what they're doing is they're

09:56.240 --> 09:58.720
 training. So when you come out of Top Gun, you're

09:58.720 --> 10:01.120
 called a strike fighter, weapons and tactics instructor.

10:01.120 --> 10:06.560
 Okay, so your SFTI. When you come out of that, your job is to go usually to one

10:06.560 --> 10:09.840
 of the weapons schools on the east or west coast and train the fleet squadrons,

10:09.840 --> 10:13.280
 and then you visit the squadrons and train and do upgrade rides and all that.

10:13.280 --> 10:18.800
 So there's a, there's a reason that they're extremely particular

10:18.800 --> 10:21.840
 when you go through the course. It's, it is literally one of the best things.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.560
 And it's not, it's not a rank based thing, because think, oh, Navy,

10:24.560 --> 10:31.120
 you can come in as a, you know, like an 04 Lieutenant Commander. The lieutenants,

10:31.120 --> 10:34.240
 the hierarchy, well, it used to be, I don't know how it is exactly today,

10:34.240 --> 10:39.120
 but I imagine it's the same. The hierarchy is actually based on seniority at the school,

10:39.120 --> 10:42.400
 not necessarily rank. So when the tactical decisions are made,

10:42.400 --> 10:46.720
 which are based on fact and trying things out in the Fallon ranges,

10:48.160 --> 10:52.240
 they set the top X number of folks that have been there seniority wise.

10:52.240 --> 10:57.040
 And I mean, time wise are the ones that actually make the decision. And when the door,

10:57.040 --> 11:00.400
 you may not agree, but when the door opens and everyone comes out

11:01.280 --> 11:06.880
 from the staff, they all speak the same language. It's, and it has to be that way,

11:06.880 --> 11:10.160
 which is why the school has been so effective since it was founded.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.920
 So it's just a, it's an incredible group of individuals.

11:13.920 --> 11:19.760
 So there's a bar of excellence that, that the instructors demand.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.400
 Oh, very much so. And they're held to it. So it's not a, hey, I'm now an instructor,

11:24.400 --> 11:29.760
 so I can do what I want. There is a standard and they have to live up to that standard.

11:29.760 --> 11:35.600
 They have to, and I mean, every moment of every day. So if they go someplace, if they go from

11:35.600 --> 11:38.800
 Fallon and they come down and do, they're called site visits where they come down and they'll come

11:38.800 --> 11:41.920
 to LeMore, California, which is where the West Coast Fighter Wing is at for the Navy.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.680
 And they go around and start flying sorties with the fleet squadrons

11:45.680 --> 11:50.960
 to kind of pass on some of that knowledge. That's that same high level of standard. It's,

11:50.960 --> 11:55.760
 they can't just drop your guard because you wear the top gun patch and people know that.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.280
 And they wear light blue shirts. So it's pretty easy to identify them when they're out there.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.000
 And, you know, and then everyone else who's been through the school,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.600
 including them, have the patch on their sleeve. So there's a standard that's expected when you

12:05.600 --> 12:10.000
 come out of there. So you were a Navy pilot for 18 years. Yes.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.960
 Can you briefly tell the story of your career as a pilot?

12:14.960 --> 12:21.280
 Yeah. So, you know, first I was enlisted. I was a Marine. And then

12:22.400 --> 12:28.080
 the Marines actually sent me, recommended me to go to the Naval Academy. So it's always better

12:28.080 --> 12:32.320
 to be lucky than good. But I got to go to the Naval Academy and I finished. And I've had that

12:32.320 --> 12:38.240
 dream to fly. So when I got selected, they've always dreamed of flying. Yeah. Since 1969,

12:38.240 --> 12:43.200
 when I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon, I was, at that point, I asked my mom,

12:43.200 --> 12:47.440
 I remember watching it. I was just prior to being five. And I said,

12:48.800 --> 12:53.040
 wow, yeah, it's so cool, mom. And she said, well, you know, they were all pilots.

12:53.040 --> 12:57.760
 And then at that point, it was like, I'm going to be a pilot. And if you knew me growing up,

12:57.760 --> 13:03.200
 because I was a little bit of a delinquent, people are just like, yeah, right. I used to joke,

13:03.200 --> 13:07.920
 I'm going to fly, I'm going to fly jets, I'm going to drop bombs. Then, and if people that knew me

13:07.920 --> 13:12.080
 when I was a kid, they'd be like, yeah, and they'd be like, not a chance. And then when I did,

13:12.080 --> 13:16.720
 I actually had a, this is a funny story and I'll get to it and I'll finish my career. But

13:16.720 --> 13:22.080
 I was at my cousin's wedding and we all grew up in the same neighborhood. We kind of,

13:22.080 --> 13:26.160
 they had Italian side of the family. That's how we grew up. So it was my house right down the

13:26.160 --> 13:30.000
 street. It was my cousin Chad and right around the corner is my cousin Ray and my aunts and uncles

13:30.000 --> 13:33.440
 and stuff. The guy two doors down from my, and I was a paper boy in the neighborhood. So they

13:33.440 --> 13:38.800
 all knew me. And I went to my cousin's wedding and he, and Mr. Race looks at me and he says,

13:38.800 --> 13:44.800
 David Fravor, I go, Mr. Race, how you doing? He goes, you fly jets, top gun and all that. I go,

13:44.800 --> 13:52.080
 yes, sir. He goes, man, I figured you'd be in jail by now. And it was kind of a, to me, it was a

13:52.080 --> 13:56.400
 little bit of a badge of honor going on. And I kind of overcame that. But what do you attribute that

13:56.400 --> 14:01.760
 to? So you, I've heard you before and just now I'll say that it's better to be, it's better to

14:01.760 --> 14:11.440
 be lucky than good. And you talk modestly about, about just being lucky. But if you were to describe

14:11.440 --> 14:19.440
 your trajectory, maybe in a way of advice, like retrospectively, how'd you pull it off to be

14:19.440 --> 14:27.440
 like, to be truly a special person? The easiest way is one never, never take no. Don't let anyone

14:27.440 --> 14:33.200
 put you down and say, you can't do it. Or those, I mean, I knew, I knew what I was capable of inside,

14:33.200 --> 14:37.440
 you know, and if I really believe if you want something and you want to do something, then you,

14:37.440 --> 14:43.760
 you can achieve it. Not in all cases, like if I loved basketball, and I really wanted to be in

14:43.760 --> 14:48.800
 the NBA, there's a realism that says, I'm five foot eight, and I got like a really short vertical

14:48.800 --> 14:51.680
 leap. And I'm really not that good at basketball. It's probably not ever going to happen, no matter

14:51.680 --> 14:57.520
 how hard I try and practice. It's just the way it is. Or for me to be in the NFL, I'm not fast,

14:58.160 --> 15:05.280
 you know, I'm not that big. It's just physically, I'm incapable of doing that. But there's things

15:05.280 --> 15:11.680
 that don't really tie to a true physical ability as far as size and strength, but it's, it's mental.

15:12.400 --> 15:16.160
 And I'm not saying you have to be a genius and super smart to be a fighter pilot. As a matter

15:16.160 --> 15:22.800
 of fact, you don't. It really comes down to the ability to think very quickly. 80% solution is

15:22.800 --> 15:28.000
 typically good enough because if you overthink it, you're behind. And then in an air to air fight,

15:28.000 --> 15:32.160
 that's what happens. People try and overthink it. And before you know it, because it's happening so

15:32.160 --> 15:37.520
 fast, you don't have, you can't get to the nth degree, you know, six decimal places. 80% solution

15:37.520 --> 15:41.600
 is good enough. You build up a really strong gut for the 80% solution. Just yeah, I'm a big believer

15:41.600 --> 15:46.960
 in the 80% solution. I love that. If you get 80% you can go and then you can always adjust,

15:46.960 --> 15:51.600
 which is exactly what, like if you're fighting in BFM, the 80% solution is, it's like a chess

15:51.600 --> 15:56.240
 game, but it's a really, really fast chess game where you go, I'm doing this. And then I know

15:56.240 --> 16:01.920
 that if I do a maneuver, if he's going to counter it correctly, he should do A. If he doesn't do

16:01.920 --> 16:08.720
 A, he does some degree less like BCD. And then I know how bad his, his error is. And then I

16:08.720 --> 16:12.560
 capitalize. So my, my, I don't have to be perfect. You know, I don't have to go, I need to go to

16:12.560 --> 16:17.680
 47 degrees, nose high. If I just kind of get above 40, then I'm good and I can watch how he reacts

16:17.680 --> 16:22.720
 and then I can adjust for that. And you, and you continually work that problem and you chip away,

16:22.720 --> 16:26.400
 because if you start neutral, you're just basically chipping away and gaining advantage,

16:26.400 --> 16:31.600
 advantage, advantage. So eventually, you know, and if you're really, you know, fighting, you know,

16:31.600 --> 16:35.760
 just guns only rear quarter where you got to get behind the guy, kind of World War II dogfighting

16:35.760 --> 16:43.040
 type stuff, then it's, it's literally, it's a, it's a very, very fast chess game that happens at,

16:43.680 --> 16:50.400
 you know, 400 knots, 300 knots depends. So to get to be one of the rear individuals that are able

16:50.400 --> 16:58.080
 to do that, he just had the dream and didn't take no for an answer. Well, you know, you know, part

16:58.080 --> 17:05.600
 of it is family, you know, my dad was, I used to call him a fire ready aim guy, you know, he'd smack

17:05.600 --> 17:12.560
 me and then ask me what I did wrong. Back then, you know, I joke and people look, because, you

17:12.560 --> 17:16.000
 know, at times it was kind of tough, you know, because he can be pretty demanding, but on the

17:16.000 --> 17:21.760
 other side, you know, I probably needed to be rained in a little bit at times. But then everyone

17:21.760 --> 17:27.520
 else, my family, you know, my mom was really awesome when I was a kid. My, my grandfather,

17:27.520 --> 17:34.960
 who is a big, big part of it, my mom's dad, who he taught me a lot. And you have a question

17:34.960 --> 17:41.280
 there that we'll talk about him, but huge, huge influence, very, very positive. And a lot of

17:41.280 --> 17:48.800
 the stuff that I do today and decisions are based on things that he taught me. And, you know, I

17:48.800 --> 17:55.040
 figured, you know, it was the first funeral I ever went to, and it was about three miles long and

17:55.040 --> 18:00.320
 the church was overfilling and people were out. He was a beer delivery guy, dead serious. And you

18:00.320 --> 18:06.880
 go, someone asked who died the Pope. So a lot of people loved him. So back to, back to my career.

18:06.880 --> 18:11.760
 Yeah. First question, because I'm getting down at rabbit hole. No, I, when I was at the, I was

18:11.760 --> 18:15.360
 going to, I was going to stay in the Marines. I really wanted to go, man, I love the Corps. I

18:15.360 --> 18:20.560
 think it's of all services. It's that one, everything is in a ball and they're very, very

18:20.560 --> 18:27.200
 professional and it was a great, great organization to join. But I went out to the Nimitz on my

18:28.240 --> 18:32.000
 freshman cruise. After your freshman year at the Naval Academy, you go out on a ship and you,

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
 you're an enlisted person. You get to experience that half when I was enlisted. So it's fine with

18:36.000 --> 18:41.360
 me. Because it comes up a lot. You mind saying what the Nimitz is, what a ship is. Yeah. So

18:41.360 --> 18:47.120
 Nimitz is an aircraft carrier. So it's four and a half acres of sovereign U.S. territory that floats

18:47.120 --> 18:52.640
 around the U.S. oceans. Does it have weapons on it? The air wing is really the weapons.

18:52.640 --> 18:58.640
 It does have defensive weapons, but for the most part it's a giant moving airport is what it is.

18:58.640 --> 19:04.560
 So I was out there watching the airplanes land and take off. And I'm like, oh, and the squadrons

19:04.560 --> 19:10.560
 that were out there, one of the squadrons was a VF 41 and F 14 squadron, VF 84 and F 14 squadron,

19:10.560 --> 19:14.880
 and then a couple of A6 squadrons. And we actually ended up part pairing up and hanging out with some

19:14.880 --> 19:20.560
 of the A6 pilots and BNs. So it was really a neat experience. And I said, I want to do that.

19:20.560 --> 19:25.520
 And the way to do it was to not, to go in the Navy because there are marine squadrons that go out

19:25.520 --> 19:29.520
 to the aircraft carriers, but most of them are land based, you know, to support the Marines,

19:29.520 --> 19:34.080
 because they're that, that unit, that whole unit, you know, the Marine Corps is at one surface as

19:34.080 --> 19:42.000
 at all. And so when I graduated and I got to, you know, I worked hard through primary and that's

19:42.000 --> 19:46.160
 where, you know, I knew Missy. We were in, actually went through together, Missy Cummings.

19:46.720 --> 19:51.120
 We went through primary together. And then I went to Kingsville. We all selected the same time.

19:51.120 --> 19:56.000
 I went to Kingsville. There was another guy, Scott Weedemire, the three of us. So I went to

19:56.000 --> 20:01.520
 Kingsville, Scott went to Beaville and Missy went to Meridian. So the three of us that we had all

20:01.520 --> 20:06.160
 went through, we got, we selected out of primary together, we all ended up going jets. And that's,

20:06.160 --> 20:11.200
 that's how, besides from school, I knew her at school too. The long story I got done, got winged,

20:11.200 --> 20:15.120
 it took me two years to the day from the time I graduated the Naval Academy until I got my wings.

20:15.840 --> 20:22.800
 And through some luck, I ended up getting A6s on the West Coast, which is a side by side

20:22.800 --> 20:26.480
 bomber. So it's a pilot on the left seat and the Bombardier navigators on the right seat. It was

20:26.480 --> 20:33.040
 built in the 60s. It is all weather and it flies low at night. It's got a terrain mapping radar.

20:33.040 --> 20:38.720
 How many, I guess, is that a good term to use fighter jets as a broad category for,

20:38.720 --> 20:43.120
 for the public? Yeah, that's fine. How many fighter jets are side by side like that?

20:43.120 --> 20:48.640
 That was, in the Navy, that was the only one. The Air Force, the F111 was a side by side,

20:48.640 --> 20:52.480
 but the Navy, it was the A6. And then there's the EA6B, which is a derivative of

20:53.040 --> 20:58.000
 that. Now that those are all gone. The EA6Bs just went away a few years ago. And now the E18G

20:58.000 --> 21:04.720
 Growler is the replacement for the EA6B. There was never a replacement for the A6 that I flew.

21:04.720 --> 21:10.880
 It really became the F18, which the A6 could go quite a bit further distance wise by fuel.

21:11.840 --> 21:18.800
 Then the Hornet. The Hornet is the F18. Is there usually two people in the plane, but they're

21:18.800 --> 21:24.560
 usually like in front and behind? In the modern two seaters, yes. But most of the tactical

21:24.560 --> 21:28.320
 airplanes in the world today are single seat. Single seat is just one person. One person.

21:28.320 --> 21:32.960
 With the exception of, I'll probably, someone will yell at me, but really with the exception of

21:32.960 --> 21:39.360
 the F15E Strike Eagle and the F18F Super Hornet, which is the F is a two seater. And the G is also

21:39.360 --> 21:43.520
 a two seater, but it's more of an electronic attack by, say, full up fighter bomber.

21:44.240 --> 21:51.760
 So most of the time that you've flown in your, like I said, 18 year career, was a two seater?

21:51.760 --> 21:56.720
 That was about half and half. So I started off an A6 was a two seater. Then I went to single seat

21:56.720 --> 22:06.800
 F18s and I flew those all the way up until 2000 and let me think, 2001 to the end of 2001.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.880
 And then I shifted over and started flying the Super Hornets and I've flown both of those,

22:10.880 --> 22:17.840
 the E's and the S, but I deployed when I had command of VFA 41. I had the two seat. They were F squadron.

22:17.840 --> 22:27.040
 So you eventually ended up commanding the, the strike fighter squadron 41. I love the, the name,

22:27.040 --> 22:35.520
 the black aces. What, is there some parts of that journey that are amazing parts of it that are tough

22:35.520 --> 22:41.360
 that kind of stand out? To me, it was, one, it was a huge honor. And I got to serve with,

22:42.080 --> 22:46.400
 you know, I got pulled up because the guy, the people that are exos, because we fleet up,

22:46.400 --> 22:50.480
 you go from the number two guy to the number one guy. So the exo becomes the CEO. So the

22:50.480 --> 22:57.360
 executive officer becomes the commanding officer. So I had worked with, now soon to be Vice Admiral

22:57.360 --> 23:03.360
 Weitzel, was the, he was commander Weitzel at the time was the exo. And he really wanted,

23:03.360 --> 23:08.320
 because he knew there was a little bit of a problem when the Super Hornets came into LeMore.

23:08.320 --> 23:16.720
 LeMore had been a single seat fighter community since the forever. And now all of a sudden you've

23:16.720 --> 23:21.760
 got the F18F coming in, which has the weapon systems operators in the back that are not pilots,

23:21.760 --> 23:27.280
 they're weapon systems operators. And there's a difference. And Kenny is a weapon systems operator.

23:27.280 --> 23:34.000
 And Kenny knew because of my A6 background that I have a switch that I can go one seat, two seat,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.240
 one seat, two seat. Because when you fly two seat, there's a lot of stuff that the pilot will

23:38.240 --> 23:43.760
 offload and take the advantage of the weapon systems operator. And it's not that one plus

23:43.760 --> 23:48.400
 one equals two in that environment, because it really, there's a huge amount of capabilities

23:48.400 --> 23:53.200
 that the single seat has and the autonomy that comes for the ability to make decisions quickly

23:53.200 --> 23:59.120
 and how well the airplane flies. But it does, it does equal more than one. And I would say

23:59.120 --> 24:05.760
 that one plus one with two people as well is a minimum of 1.5. Because you've got an extra head,

24:05.760 --> 24:10.320
 you've got extra eyes, you've got someone that can monitor systems, the airplanes can do two

24:10.320 --> 24:13.920
 things at once. I mean, there's an incredible amount of capability that we add when we do that.

24:14.560 --> 24:19.440
 Can we just pause on that? Just for me, from like a human factors perspective and also an AI

24:19.440 --> 24:26.880
 perspective, what's, how difficult, so there's like, when there's two people, there's also a

24:26.880 --> 24:33.840
 third person that's the AI part, the some level of automation, like autopilot, maybe that's correct,

24:33.840 --> 24:40.080
 maybe you can kind of talk about the psychology of like, you said, making decisions really quick,

24:40.080 --> 24:48.800
 80%. How do you deal with another brain working with you? And then also the automation, is there

24:48.800 --> 24:54.480
 interesting interplay that you get to learn? And also as that changed throughout your career,

24:54.480 --> 24:58.720
 I imagine it got, it gotten better in terms of the automation, or perhaps not?

24:59.440 --> 25:04.000
 Well, I can tell you, so let's start. No, this is good. This is good. And this is,

25:04.720 --> 25:08.080
 I'm enjoying this because now we actually get to talk about something other than a tic tac. So

25:09.520 --> 25:14.960
 let's start with the A6. The A6 was really an analog airplane that was built in the 60s.

25:15.680 --> 25:20.880
 All right. And there's been studies done on the crew coordination, which is the interaction

25:20.880 --> 25:26.480
 between the pilot and the bombardier navigator. So we would fly low at night in the mountains.

25:26.480 --> 25:30.400
 So I was stationed up in Whidbey Island, Washington. So you've got the Cascades and

25:31.200 --> 25:36.240
 incredible amount of time. And we would get in the simulators because unlike, normally people

25:36.240 --> 25:40.960
 think terrain following, and there's the radars, the 111, the B1 has a system like this, but it'll,

25:40.960 --> 25:44.240
 the radar can see and it'll fly, it basically flies a straight line. So it goes up and over

25:44.240 --> 25:48.240
 mountains and back down and up and over mountains where the A6 was really manual.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.640
 So you do this low level routes where you're going to, you're going to fly in the mountains at night,

25:52.640 --> 25:58.000
 you're going to be at, you know, 500 to 1,000 feet above the ground, ripping through like fog

25:58.000 --> 26:02.240
 layers, because you don't need to see outside. You're, you're literally flying a little TV screen

26:02.240 --> 26:06.320
 and a radar. What are you looking at most of the time? So just as a screen? It's this really

26:06.320 --> 26:11.440
 primitive. If you look at it now, what we did, you'd think, wow, that was crazy, but it was really

26:11.440 --> 26:17.040
 fun. So is it similar to like the FLIR stuff? Is that, are you? No, this thing is totally

26:17.040 --> 26:21.280
 radar based. Now the airplane had a FLIR ball, it's a target recognition and multi sensor,

26:21.280 --> 26:27.120
 it was called a tram. So you're looking at like basically like dots of hard objects?

26:27.120 --> 26:31.920
 No, actually what it is is the, the bomb of your navigator had a radar and he was getting raw feet

26:31.920 --> 26:36.880
 off of a pulse radar in front. Okay. So it's just basically mapping the mountain. So if you look at

26:36.880 --> 26:40.400
 a mountain on a radar and you're coming up on it, the front side is going to be, it's going to give

26:40.400 --> 26:44.720
 you a really bright return. And then the backside, it's just going to be a giant shadow because you

26:44.720 --> 26:49.840
 can't see on the other side. So the bombardier navigators would do that and they would have

26:49.840 --> 26:53.440
 charts and they could shade their charts knowing that, hey, if we turn a little bit left here,

26:53.440 --> 26:56.720
 we can get in this valley, we can sneak up this valley and then go around the backside of the

26:56.720 --> 27:01.520
 mountain, which is what the airplane would do. And sorry to interrupt, I'm going to just keep

27:01.520 --> 27:07.680
 asking dumb questions, I apologize. But the pilot, can you at a high level say what the pilot does

27:07.680 --> 27:14.240
 versus the bombardier? Yes. So you're actually just controlled. I'm flying the jet. I have the

27:14.240 --> 27:21.760
 throttles, the stick and I have a, it's about a probably a four inch or six inch wide by maybe

27:23.120 --> 27:27.920
 four inches, five inches high. It looks like it's literally a CRT. That's how old it is.

27:27.920 --> 27:32.480
 A CRT screen and what it would do, what the radar would do is the, the, the bombardier

27:32.480 --> 27:36.160
 navigator is looking at his radar and he's looking at about 12 and a half miles in front of the

27:36.160 --> 27:40.160
 airplane. So he has the range really scoped down because the radar can see a lot further.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.440
 He's looking at about 12 and a half miles when we're in the terrain mode where we're

27:43.440 --> 27:47.680
 dodging mountains and stuff. And what the pilot has is there's, they're called range bins and

27:47.680 --> 27:53.520
 there's eight of them. So the very far range bin is the 12 and a half mile, you know, and

27:54.160 --> 27:58.640
 the closest range bin, it's a thing and it'll be like between like a half a mile and

27:59.760 --> 28:02.800
 a quarter mile to three quarters of a mile. And the next one might be three quarters of a

28:02.800 --> 28:07.760
 mile to two miles. And then it just keeps going out like that. So if there's a mountain in front,

28:07.760 --> 28:12.560
 let's say we're on a flat plane and there's a mountain out in the distance at 15 miles,

28:12.560 --> 28:16.960
 and we, we're just driving right at it. So when we get to the point where it hits 12 and a

28:16.960 --> 28:22.320
 half miles where the radar is going to see it on his scope, my 12, my range bin for that would

28:22.320 --> 28:27.040
 pop up and it would show like a big bump, like a mountain. And then as I got closer to it,

28:27.040 --> 28:31.520
 the next range bin would pop up and show it. And I could see that that bump was moving towards me.

28:32.080 --> 28:36.320
 And then if I turned a little bit, you know, to go over here, I'd see the mountain go over to

28:36.320 --> 28:41.840
 the right hand side and I could do that. But it wasn't like a video game. It was, it's literally

28:41.840 --> 28:48.320
 like, if you think of the original Atari's. Yeah. But you build up, I imagine that you start to get

28:49.040 --> 28:55.600
 a really deep sense of like the actual three, three D environment based on that little Atari.

28:56.400 --> 29:00.240
 You're exactly right. And you have to, you have to train. So there's been studies.

29:00.240 --> 29:04.400
 As a matter of fact, a lot of the basis and people probably argue with me, but it's true.

29:04.400 --> 29:08.640
 There were studies done watching a six crews in our simulators, we call it the WIST,

29:08.640 --> 29:12.960
 the Weapon Systems Trainer. And it was not even a motion, it just kind of sat there and

29:12.960 --> 29:16.480
 you just, you could fly these things and they had trained that they would inject into the system.

29:17.440 --> 29:24.960
 But the crew coordination, so you get, so my first fleet, Bombardier Navigator, who I'll name him,

29:24.960 --> 29:33.520
 his name is Crusado, he's works at Apple, pretty high up, MIT grad. I think computer engineering,

29:33.520 --> 29:40.320
 he's scary smart. So Chris could really work. As a matter of fact, all the guys that flew us,

29:40.320 --> 29:43.680
 so there's another guy, Matt, who also worked at Apple, who's now at SAP, we did our first

29:43.680 --> 29:47.520
 night traps together. The bond between us, I mean, it's one of those things that you just,

29:47.520 --> 29:50.560
 you're never going to forget, but Chris and I, when we started flying together and we were

29:50.560 --> 29:58.560
 actually the most junior crew in the squadron, we'd spent a lot of time training and Chris was

29:58.560 --> 30:04.080
 amazing at how he could work the system. One, because he was extremely brilliant and he had

30:04.080 --> 30:07.600
 that inquisitive mind of, oh, we could do all these different things and there's all these

30:07.600 --> 30:14.240
 degradation modes. But we spent a lot of time to see how good we could actually get because,

30:14.240 --> 30:20.400
 and it's, you almost talk in partial. So as the BN is looking at his radar scope, Chris would say,

30:21.360 --> 30:25.760
 I've got rising terrain, that's just what they say, showing rising terrain at 12 miles. And I'd

30:25.760 --> 30:30.480
 see the little bump and I'd say, got it. This is going to go to your question on the autonomy and

30:30.480 --> 30:36.240
 how you work with two heads. Yes. So when you first get together, the interaction, it's almost

30:36.240 --> 30:43.120
 like you have to rehearse it, you have to know, and you talk in full senses. The more and more

30:43.120 --> 30:51.680
 we fly together, Chris could go, I'm showing, and he'd get like rising out. And before he finished,

30:51.680 --> 30:57.360
 I'd say, I've got it. So you end up starting to talk in partials because I have to trust him

30:58.720 --> 31:03.600
 like, I mean, I had, there can be no, I can have no doubt that he knows how to do his job.

31:04.320 --> 31:08.160
 Because I'm literally looking at this little scope that's not giving me this continuous

31:08.160 --> 31:11.520
 picture of that mountain moving. Remember the mountains here, and then it's going to pop up

31:11.520 --> 31:15.600
 here. And then it's going to pop up here because there's gaps in the coverage on how the system

31:15.600 --> 31:20.480
 was set up. Remember, it's an analog system to where he is telling me, like, I can't see all

31:20.480 --> 31:24.400
 the way to the left, and he's got a wider scope on the radar, but my screen doesn't show that.

31:25.440 --> 31:30.880
 So he's telling me, start a left turn, or start a hard turn, you know, and we would do that. So

31:30.880 --> 31:35.840
 my trust is all happening quick, very quick. Well, you're doing, we would typically fly between

31:35.840 --> 31:45.120
 420 and 480 knots of ground speed. Well, for 27 miles a minute. Okay. Or between seven and eight

31:45.120 --> 31:49.680
 miles a minute is what you're flying at night. I mean, I broke out of clouds. I mean, I remember

31:49.680 --> 31:55.600
 him and I flying. We were on its IR, it's called an IR route, an instrument route that's low.

31:55.600 --> 32:00.160
 They're all around the country. There's IR 344 that we used to fly, which would coast in off of

32:00.160 --> 32:03.520
 Oregon. You'd fly from the land, you go out over the ocean, turn around, and then you could practice

32:03.520 --> 32:10.320
 actually coming in on a coastline. And we were flying, and we ended up in the clouds. Keep in

32:10.320 --> 32:13.680
 mind, we're between 500 and 1,000 feet in the mountains, and we're in the clouds. Like, you

32:13.680 --> 32:17.040
 can't see anything. And it had to turn off our red lights that flash, you know, they're called

32:17.040 --> 32:21.440
 the anti collision lights because it was reflecting off the clouds and it starts to bother you.

32:21.440 --> 32:26.640
 It just gets annoying. So I turned it off and we were flying, we're flying, we're flying, we

32:26.640 --> 32:32.320
 break out of that coastal marine layer and we break out. And it's a decent night. And this is

32:32.320 --> 32:35.520
 right by Mount St. Helens. This is kind of where we're coming in. So we're coming in from the east

32:35.520 --> 32:39.120
 and we're just north of Mount St. Helens is where the route goes. And you look up, you know,

32:39.120 --> 32:41.760
 because you can kind of see the silhouette of this mountain that's right next to you,

32:41.760 --> 32:45.840
 but you're flying along here just like, you know, you got to trust. And you can see houses,

32:45.840 --> 32:49.280
 you can see the lights that are above you. We're literally below people's houses flying down these

32:49.280 --> 32:54.320
 valleys and stuff. So just incredible experience. So when you take that and then you move into

32:54.320 --> 32:58.960
 an F18F. So now we're into modern technology that was actually built in this century

33:01.280 --> 33:05.040
 in your flying. So now, you know, the WIZO is behind us and we're not doing those night low

33:05.040 --> 33:11.440
 levels, but that same type of crew coordination that has to happen because what you're doing is

33:11.440 --> 33:15.280
 you're sharing the load. So most of the communications that go out of the airplane,

33:15.280 --> 33:18.640
 the WIZO does all the talking. He's got actually, he uses his feet. That's the

33:18.640 --> 33:23.440
 weapon systems operator in the back of an F18F. So he's going to run, well,

33:23.440 --> 33:28.560
 the radar kind of runs itself now, but we have a situational awareness display and it's linked

33:28.560 --> 33:31.920
 to all the other airplanes. Just a curiosity, what's the situational awareness display?

33:31.920 --> 33:36.720
 Because that term comes up a lot. Think of it as a God's eye view. So if you have a,

33:36.720 --> 33:41.360
 the back of the Super Hornet has, well, the Block 2s has about an 8x10 display for the WIZOs

33:41.360 --> 33:46.400
 that they can look at. The pilot is smaller. It's down between us. It's a 6x6 between his legs

33:46.400 --> 33:51.440
 and they're, they're getting ready to redesign that Boeing is, but when you look, it'd be like

33:51.440 --> 33:55.840
 if you put your airplane and you're looking down. So all the stuff, like if your radar seeing bad

33:55.840 --> 33:58.880
 guys out in front of you, it'd be like looking down, going, oh, I'm right here and now there's

33:58.880 --> 34:03.840
 bad guys out here and my wingman is over here and it shows everything. It's just like, it gives you,

34:03.840 --> 34:08.160
 you can look at that display and go, oh, I can see where everything's at. I can see if one guy's

34:08.160 --> 34:12.240
 trying to target another guy, it shows you all this. It's an incredible amount of knowledge that

34:12.240 --> 34:19.600
 comes up for the crews to maintain the overall picture of what's going on.

34:19.600 --> 34:20.800
 The big picture sense of what's going on.

34:20.800 --> 34:26.160
 Because it's happening so fast and this is with that autonomy piece. This is the third brain.

34:26.160 --> 34:30.240
 So we're all looking at it and the third brain is doing fusion. It's pulling stuff together,

34:30.240 --> 34:33.520
 going, oh, this is all this guy. This is this guy. This is this guy. It's sending it out through

34:33.520 --> 34:36.480
 the link. So all the airplanes are talking to each other through this digital network,

34:36.480 --> 34:41.120
 you know, that we don't even see. It just says that airplane says, hey, I'm over here and it

34:41.120 --> 34:46.320
 tells us and we go, oh, he's right there. And then we can go, his airplane says, oh, I'm looking at

34:46.320 --> 34:50.320
 this airplane, this bad guy and it shows us. Oh, he's over there and he's looking at this guy.

34:50.320 --> 34:56.880
 I mean, it's an incredible amount of visual intake because your eye, you can hear a lot,

34:56.880 --> 35:00.240
 but when you look down at stuff itself, you know, you can sell the picture really quick.

35:00.240 --> 35:07.040
 The third brain is doing the sensor fusion, the integration of the different sensors and

35:07.040 --> 35:12.400
 gives you a big picture view. What about the control? Like, is there, and I apologize if this

35:12.400 --> 35:18.640
 is a dumb question, but, you know, people use the high level term of autopilot. How much is there,

35:20.000 --> 35:25.680
 let's use a loose term of AI. How much automation is there? How much AI is there in helping you

35:25.680 --> 35:30.480
 control the airplane? The AI piece would be more of a control loop because of the digital flight

35:30.480 --> 35:36.400
 controls. So the airplane actually, they had to make the airplane easier to fly. And when I say

35:36.400 --> 35:40.960
 easy, it's relative because people go, I can do it because I did it on FlightSim. Real life is a

35:40.960 --> 35:45.440
 lot different. In FlightSim, you have no apparent fear of death. You'll do things in the simulator

35:45.440 --> 35:51.600
 that you would never do in real life. But the autonomy in the airplane to allow you to manage,

35:51.600 --> 35:55.920
 I mean, because you think about it, you've got a radar that's feeding you data. You've got a

35:55.920 --> 36:00.160
 targeting pod that's feeding you data. All that stuff is hooked to your head because you've got

36:00.160 --> 36:04.640
 a joint helmet mounting queuing system on that basically maps the magnetic field in the cockpit

36:04.640 --> 36:08.880
 so it can tell where your head's at looking. So if I turn my head to the right, the radar will

36:08.880 --> 36:12.320
 actually look to the right. The targeting flare will look to the right. And oh, by the way,

36:12.880 --> 36:16.880
 the backseater has a helmet on too, so he can look to the left and he can do things. So depending

36:16.880 --> 36:22.240
 on what sensor he's controlling, so if he's got control of the targeting pod and he looks left,

36:22.240 --> 36:27.200
 the targeting pod looks left. But if I have something where I want to lock a guy up that I

36:27.200 --> 36:30.320
 don't see that maybe the radar didn't see, but I can get over and now point the radar,

36:30.320 --> 36:33.600
 you know, get the, because it's a phase array radar, now it doesn't really scan.

36:34.640 --> 36:40.880
 There's all kinds of cool stuff that technology brings because if you just,

36:40.880 --> 36:44.560
 if you went back 30 years and said, hey, or 40 years ago and said, hey, we're going to have

36:44.560 --> 36:47.840
 this helmet and you're going to be able to slew everything to your head. And I don't mean a

36:47.840 --> 36:52.160
 mechanical setup, but I mean literally you're just going to map magnetic resonance and go, oh,

36:52.160 --> 36:58.480
 look, and, and I can, I can literally slew my sensors this fast and then mash a button and

36:58.480 --> 37:03.760
 transfer, you know, high quality coordinates from a system into a joint, you know, a JDAM,

37:03.760 --> 37:08.560
 which is a joint direct attack munition that is the GPS bombs that you see all the time and then

37:08.560 --> 37:15.040
 let that thing fly and I'm, I'm solving this problem in seconds, vice minutes or hey, I got it,

37:15.040 --> 37:18.400
 we're going to have to menstruate coordinates and you know, you bring back the data and then

37:18.400 --> 37:22.480
 they do all the targeting for it and then they send another group out to get it. Instead of all that,

37:22.480 --> 37:28.000
 now it's that fast. So there's a, okay, I mean, we probably don't have enough time to talk about

37:28.000 --> 37:33.120
 the beautiful fusion of minds that happens when two people are flying, controlling the plane.

37:33.120 --> 37:38.960
 But at a high level, this is a really interesting question for people who don't know what they're

37:38.960 --> 37:47.120
 talking about like me, which is what is the difference between a human being and an AI system?

37:47.120 --> 37:54.000
 Like what can, what is the ceiling of a current AI technology for controlling the plane? Like,

37:54.000 --> 38:00.320
 how much does the human contribute? Is it possible to have automated flight, for example,

38:00.320 --> 38:08.560
 like what is the hardest part about flying that a human does expertly that an AI system cannot

38:09.280 --> 38:15.200
 in warfare situations, in, in flying fighter jet line?

38:15.200 --> 38:22.400
 So I would say AI systems are usually black and white. When you write the algorithm for an AI system,

38:23.200 --> 38:27.760
 it's, it's, it's, it's really, it's basically you're taking thought and turning it into a

38:27.760 --> 38:32.560
 giant math problem is really what you're doing. Right? So you've got this logical math problem.

38:32.560 --> 38:36.960
 Math problems are, there's, there's, there's a line it says I can or I can't. And it's a,

38:36.960 --> 38:43.120
 it's a very finite line, you know, but you can go up to the line where a human, we all have gray

38:43.120 --> 38:50.640
 areas where we go, maybe I'll try it. So humans can operate within that gray. So if you took,

38:50.640 --> 38:54.080
 if you take an airplane and say, and I'll just take a Hornet for a while, a Super Hornet,

38:54.080 --> 38:58.800
 it doesn't matter any airplane, and you go, here is the flight performance model of the airplane.

38:58.800 --> 39:05.120
 So if you know an, an EM diagram is the energy. So it basically says the airplane can fly as slow

39:05.120 --> 39:09.840
 as this, it can go as fast as this, it can pull this many Gs force of gravity, you know, so one,

39:09.840 --> 39:14.320
 two, three, four, five, six, seven. And then based on the airfoil design and everything else and how

39:14.320 --> 39:18.720
 it can pull, here's how it's going to fly, you know, because it's really physics based.

39:19.360 --> 39:24.000
 Well, if you, depending on how you write the AI, but typically AI, you don't want the airplane

39:24.000 --> 39:28.560
 to leave controlled flight, right? You want to maintain it so that it is flying in a controlled

39:28.560 --> 39:34.800
 envelope where there are times, and you can go back to World War One, where people intentionally

39:34.800 --> 39:39.840
 departed the airplane from controlled flight in order to obtain an advantage, which is that's

39:39.840 --> 39:44.640
 where the human goes, can I do this? I know it's outside of where I would normally go,

39:45.440 --> 39:50.480
 but I can do that. So you can do some crazy things now, especially since the flight control logic

39:50.480 --> 39:57.920
 in modern airplanes with digital flight controls, they're extremely forgiving. So you can literally,

39:59.120 --> 40:03.520
 I've done things in Super Hornets that literally even as a pilot inside the airplane, you're just

40:03.520 --> 40:09.200
 like, wow, I cannot believe it just did that. Like it'll flop ends, which defies most logic. And I

40:09.200 --> 40:13.360
 guess, you know, in a way you could probably program it, but I still think that when you get to the

40:13.360 --> 40:22.480
 edges that may or may not give you an advantage, there are things that a human will do that AI

40:22.480 --> 40:28.720
 won't. And I don't think we've got to the point because how do you map illogical solutions? You

40:28.720 --> 40:33.920
 know, most AI is logical. It's based on some type of premise. When you write the algorithm to control

40:33.920 --> 40:41.040
 it, there's bounds. Yeah, there's this giant mess. Like you said, the difference between the

40:41.040 --> 40:48.240
 simulator in real life also gets at that somehow, that there is somehow the fear of death, all of that

40:48.880 --> 40:55.200
 beautiful mess comes into play. Like, is there a comment you can make on commercial flight,

40:55.200 --> 41:02.880
 like with Sally landing that plane famously versus the simulator, all of those discussions,

41:02.880 --> 41:07.920
 is there some? Well, it's very, it's very similar to what I was talking about earlier with the A6.

41:07.920 --> 41:14.080
 So one is when you're flying with a crew, there's standardization. So you got to remember when

41:14.080 --> 41:18.480
 Sully flew when his first officer, that's the co pilot showed up, you know, the first time they

41:18.480 --> 41:22.640
 met. And this happens all the time in the commercial world. You know, there's six, seven

41:22.640 --> 41:26.320
 thousand pilots at United Airlines, you know, your chance of flying with the same guy all the time is

41:26.320 --> 41:31.440
 slim and none. We're in the Navy, we were crewed. So I had a primary and a secondary

41:31.440 --> 41:38.160
 whizzo that flew with me for months. Oh, yeah, for like all of the deployment. So because you want

41:38.160 --> 41:44.640
 to use trust and all of those things, it increases the capability airplane. It's not to say we can't

41:44.640 --> 41:50.720
 swap out. But for true effectiveness, especially in very complex missions like a forward air

41:50.720 --> 41:54.640
 controller, we're in the air actually controlling ground assets and supporting ground troops.

41:54.640 --> 42:04.240
 If you're in a high threat area, which is crazy busy, you have to be melded when you do that. You

42:04.240 --> 42:09.680
 have to have trained to do that job. Otherwise, you're going to be ineffective. So when you get to

42:09.680 --> 42:16.080
 the commercial world, and I've got tons of friends that fly commercial, there is a standardization.

42:16.080 --> 42:19.760
 Like we know that at this point, I'm going to put this switch, you're going to do that. And

42:19.760 --> 42:24.000
 everyone, they know their rules. Captain's going to do this, first officer's going to do this.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.400
 He breaks out. So in Sully's case, when they take the birds and they know they've got a problem,

42:28.400 --> 42:32.400
 and if you've listened to the cockpit recordings of him, the two of them talking,

42:33.040 --> 42:36.480
 you got to remember, they're talking to each other when you hear the full tapes, but they're

42:36.480 --> 42:42.000
 also talking to the air traffic controllers in the New York area. And it's like, we got a bird

42:42.000 --> 42:45.600
 strike and the first officer already knows, hey, silence the alarm. They silenced the alarm. The

42:45.600 --> 42:49.600
 first officer is pulling out the book. He's going through the procedures while Sully's actually

42:49.600 --> 42:53.120
 flying the airplane, knowing that they've lost their motors. And you got to think of his decision

42:53.120 --> 42:57.440
 process, like they're trying to get him to go into an airport in New Jersey. And he realizes,

42:57.440 --> 43:00.960
 not happening, we're going to put this thing. And he made a decision soon enough

43:00.960 --> 43:04.000
 so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane that he was going to put this thing

43:04.000 --> 43:09.200
 in the Hudson River. And he did it flawlessly. I mean, every single person walked away from that

43:09.760 --> 43:12.800
 wreck. The only thing that didn't survive was the airplane, you know, and it got fished out of

43:12.800 --> 43:17.760
 the Hudson. But what is it about those human decisions he had to make? Is that something

43:17.760 --> 43:23.600
 you put into words? Or is that just deep down some instinct that you develop as a pilot over

43:23.600 --> 43:28.880
 time? It's when we, when you train, you know, an aviation is a self cleaning oven. So if you

43:28.880 --> 43:34.400
 make bad decisions, you're, and the list is long and distinguished of those who have died by making

43:34.400 --> 43:40.880
 bad decisions. Oh man. So when you look at what he did or the way we train, because the commercial

43:40.880 --> 43:46.480
 industry and the Navy and the Air Force for all that, we have what's called, we have emergency

43:46.480 --> 43:50.880
 procedures that we have to know. Like the engines on fire, the first three steps, you just have to

43:50.880 --> 43:55.840
 know what they are, right? So they know the airline, same type, you know, they go, Hey,

43:55.840 --> 43:59.280
 I know this is they pull the book out because the airplanes are designed, they're built to have some

43:59.280 --> 44:03.840
 time. But there's a point where you have to make a decision and you can't second guess it. So when

44:03.840 --> 44:08.320
 he decided, I'm putting this in the Hudson River, he couldn't all of a sudden halfway through it go,

44:08.320 --> 44:13.040
 Well, maybe I can get over to that airport. He looked, he made a quick assessment. This is that

44:13.040 --> 44:18.160
 80% solution where you go, these are not, you know, it's kind of like a multiple choice test

44:18.160 --> 44:22.240
 when you go, Oh my God, I don't really know the answer. But I know A and D are wrong. Yeah.

44:22.240 --> 44:28.000
 Gone. So the Jersey airport and going back to LaGuardia, gone. Yeah. So what's my next option?

44:28.000 --> 44:32.800
 Well, the Hudson River is there. That's probably looking pretty good. Or what is my other one?

44:32.800 --> 44:37.360
 Can I get a restart on the motors? And then if I can get a restart, now can I take it someplace

44:37.360 --> 44:43.200
 else? He had to make really, really fast decisions. And then once they as a, they go that 80%

44:43.200 --> 44:46.880
 solution, you realize, all right, I'm going into the Hudson, there's the 80%, get the book out,

44:46.880 --> 44:49.200
 let's see if we can get an air start because if you listen to the tapes are trying to get it

44:49.200 --> 44:54.960
 air started, the closer he gets to the water, the more he's going, I'm ditching the airplane.

44:54.960 --> 45:00.320
 So the original decision to this is my best option right now. This is where I'm going.

45:00.960 --> 45:04.960
 And you start eliminating anything that could possibly change the events,

45:04.960 --> 45:09.360
 which they tried to do. And then he gets to that last minute says, we're going in the water,

45:09.360 --> 45:12.240
 they changed the plan, they secure the airplane, they do exactly what they're

45:12.240 --> 45:16.400
 doing. And he does that basically flawless landing on the Hudson. But you got to remember

45:17.840 --> 45:22.640
 every, it's every six months for commercial, they go back and they do research in the airplane

45:22.640 --> 45:28.160
 in the simulator, were they trained to the airplane being broken, you just lost a motor,

45:28.160 --> 45:33.680
 you just lost another motor. So they go through this extensive training, you know, and all these,

45:33.680 --> 45:37.440
 and it's, you know, we used to refer to it in the Navy as the pain cave where you're going to get

45:37.440 --> 45:41.600
 in, because you know, that when you get in for your check ride in a simulator that the airplane

45:41.600 --> 45:45.520
 is going to break, you're going to lose hydro and it's sometimes they're a problem like, oh,

45:45.520 --> 45:48.880
 I just lost this hydraulic system, but I'm having an issue on the other motor. Well,

45:48.880 --> 45:52.880
 if I shut down this motor, I've got a hydraulic, you know, because there's two hydraulic systems,

45:52.880 --> 45:57.520
 one on each motor. Well, if I've got an issue with the left motor hydraulic system and my right

45:57.520 --> 46:01.680
 motor is starting to give me indications, do I want to shut the right motor down because that's

46:01.680 --> 46:06.080
 going to kill my hydraulic system, that's good. And now I'm flying on a good motor with a bad

46:06.080 --> 46:09.600
 hydraulic system and with a hydraulic airplane won't fly. So they, it's a really, they're

46:09.600 --> 46:13.280
 challenging problems that you have to think through in real time. And of course, the weather's

46:13.280 --> 46:18.160
 never good. It's always dark. It's always crappy. You're going to break out. I mean, it's just,

46:18.160 --> 46:24.320
 all this stuff gets compiled on top of you and it's intended to increase the level of stress,

46:24.320 --> 46:30.160
 because when things happen, like in Sully's case, we like to joke, it's going to stem power,

46:30.160 --> 46:33.680
 you know, where the functional part of your brain shuts down and you are literally on

46:33.680 --> 46:38.640
 instinct like an animal. Well, if you've trained so much that that is the instinctive reaction

46:38.640 --> 46:43.280
 that you're going to have, when the main part of your, your, your cognitive ability start to shut

46:43.280 --> 46:48.560
 down, you're, you're running that instinct is ingrained so much into you that you know exactly

46:48.560 --> 46:55.920
 what to do. And that's literally how it happens. So there's no, how do I put it, fear of death?

46:55.920 --> 47:02.640
 Like in Sully's case, do you think he was at all ever thinking about the fact if his decision is

47:02.640 --> 47:06.880
 wrong, a lot of people are going to die? You know, I can't speak for him, but I would say

47:07.600 --> 47:13.360
 there was so much going on at the cockpit in that time. His, his mindset was probably,

47:14.320 --> 47:19.120
 I can do this. I'm trained. I'm going to do the procedures. I've practiced this before. I've done

47:19.120 --> 47:23.200
 these things. And I, you know, I'm assuming that in his mindset, because I never thought about

47:23.200 --> 47:26.640
 when things were really bad, you know, if you're having problems with the airplane that, you know,

47:26.640 --> 47:30.640
 that I was going to moor, you know, and, and plant it into the ground. It was always, you know,

47:30.640 --> 47:36.160
 maybe it's an ego thing where you think I can do this. I mean. So you never, have you experienced

47:36.160 --> 47:45.920
 fear during flight? Like, I mean, one, one way, we just offline mentioned Mike Tyson. I mean,

47:45.920 --> 47:54.560
 he talked about like, uh, as he's, uh, walking up to the ring, he's like, he starts out basically

47:54.560 --> 48:01.520
 in fear and, uh, yeah, worried about how things are going to go. I mean, it's purely to put in

48:01.520 --> 48:06.800
 towards his fear, but as he gets closer and closer to the ring is the confidence grows and grows until

48:07.440 --> 48:15.520
 the ego basically takes over to where you think there's no way anybody could, uh, defeat me.

48:15.520 --> 48:21.280
 So like that's, that's his experience of overcoming fear. But do you, uh, did you

48:21.280 --> 48:25.360
 experience any kind of thing like that? Or is that, or do you just go to the part of the brain

48:25.360 --> 48:29.840
 that goes to the training and then you just go to the instinctual 80% solution?

48:30.640 --> 48:35.520
 I wouldn't say I was never afraid. I think that would be, I can't, I couldn't tell you that

48:35.520 --> 48:40.640
 anyone I know that wasn't afraid at one time. And for most of us, especially Navy carrier pilots,

48:40.640 --> 48:45.440
 it's just, it's, it's usually, especially when you're new and you got to go out and it's night

48:45.440 --> 48:49.920
 time and there's no moon and the weather sucks and the decks moving, you know, the, the ship's

48:49.920 --> 48:54.240
 going up and down because it will scare the ever living shit out of you. Can I say that?

48:55.040 --> 48:58.160
 You definitely say that. So it's about landing and take off that.

48:58.160 --> 49:02.400
 That is if you, even the, they used to wire people up. They did it during Vietnam,

49:02.400 --> 49:05.680
 you know, guys that go flying missions, you know, when they were flying low and crazy stuff was

49:05.680 --> 49:11.120
 going on and people were getting shot down a lot. The highest, the highest anxiety and

49:11.120 --> 49:13.600
 heart rates were coming back to land on board an aircraft carrier.

49:13.600 --> 49:19.280
 How hard is it to land on that? It seems impossible. Like for, for a civilian, I guess,

49:19.280 --> 49:22.960
 like me, just seems crazy that a human can do that.

49:22.960 --> 49:28.560
 The problem with night is, and there's different degrees of night, just like day. I mean,

49:28.560 --> 49:31.600
 there's the clear full moon night, you know, where it's like, whoo.

49:31.600 --> 49:37.680
 You know, this is not that bad, but you got to remember at night, I think everyone can associate

49:37.680 --> 49:43.040
 with you're driving in your car and it's just a, it's, it's an overcast, dark night and you're on

49:43.040 --> 49:49.520
 a country road with no side lights. Most people have a tendency to slow down just by nature of,

49:49.520 --> 49:52.960
 oh my God, because you, what you'll do is you'll out drive your headlights because it is so dark,

49:53.600 --> 49:56.560
 you know, and you can get outside a, you get outside a city and get up in New Hampshire,

49:56.560 --> 50:01.360
 especially when the roads are curving, you know, and the lines probably aren't that good.

50:02.240 --> 50:07.920
 It's, you know, now take that and multiply it by like a million because you have no depth perception.

50:09.680 --> 50:13.760
 What you think is fixed, the runway is actually moving.

50:14.640 --> 50:16.080
 Up and down and left to the right.

50:16.080 --> 50:21.760
 Yeah. Oh, and when it's really bad, you can actually see it move. And we have two systems,

50:21.760 --> 50:27.440
 you know, there was a, there's an automatic system that's actually, it stabilizes with

50:27.440 --> 50:33.200
 the inertials on the ship. And then there's the ILS. Now, civilian pilots will tell you that ILS

50:33.200 --> 50:37.040
 is a precision approach, which gives you azimuth and glide slope, you know, you come down, it's

50:37.040 --> 50:41.920
 like a plus on the carrier. It's not, it's really just a beam that goes out and it's considered

50:41.920 --> 50:46.880
 a nonprecision approach. It's not stabilized at all that. And I've been where you can actually

50:46.880 --> 50:50.640
 watch the needle and the, and the, the tack and needle will move. There's all kinds of stuff moving

50:50.640 --> 50:55.520
 because the, the base that it's all sitting on is doing this. And ships don't just go up and down.

50:55.520 --> 50:59.760
 They, they, they do this. So the bow goes up and down in the tail, like you normally see a ship.

50:59.760 --> 51:04.160
 And then there's, so that's pitch. And then it has roll. So it's doing this. And then it has

51:04.160 --> 51:08.400
 heave. So the whole boat is going up and down while it's pitching and rolling. And you're gonna

51:08.400 --> 51:17.040
 land on that. So, and it's, I mean, I remember landing us, I was with Chris Sado and Chris and

51:17.040 --> 51:21.120
 I, we were off the USS Ranger, which is now decommissioned. It's sitting, getting turned into

51:21.120 --> 51:26.080
 razor blades. We're flying the old A6 and we come in and it was off of San Diego and it was just

51:26.080 --> 51:30.480
 ugly night because San Diego always has a marine layer that is about 1200 feet. It was lower than

51:30.480 --> 51:34.320
 that that night. And it was pouring down rain. It was an El Nino year and there's thunderstorms

51:34.320 --> 51:38.800
 all around. It was just the craziest night I've ever seen out of San Diego. And I remember landing

51:39.600 --> 51:44.160
 and your adrenaline is so high that you're shaking. I mean, you literally can't stop.

51:44.160 --> 51:48.160
 And we had spun around out of the landing area and we parked, we call it the six pack. So it's

51:48.160 --> 51:51.200
 right in front of the island. So if you've seen aircraft carrier of the island and the number

51:51.200 --> 51:54.720
 of the ship on it, we're sitting right in front of that and we're looking at the landing area.

51:54.720 --> 52:01.280
 So it's like, you get front row seats to the concert. And, and this, this, this EA6B comes in,

52:02.000 --> 52:06.080
 you know, ugly pass, he ends up catching a one wire, which is the first one you never want to

52:06.080 --> 52:09.920
 catch the first one. It means you're not really high above the back of the ship when you landed.

52:09.920 --> 52:17.040
 And it comes in and the exhaust on any A6 or an A6 actually points kind of down and it blows and it's

52:17.040 --> 52:20.720
 blowing all the standing water on the aircraft. That's how hard it's raining. And you literally

52:20.720 --> 52:24.400
 could not see across. I mean, I could see the front of my airplane, his airplane, and then it

52:24.400 --> 52:29.600
 was just white because of the water being blown off the deck. And I'm shaking and I, I'll never

52:29.600 --> 52:33.520
 forget. I looked over at Chris and I said, Oh my God, I go, Hey, dude, man, 10,000 foot runway

52:33.520 --> 52:38.000
 looks really good right now. And I go, and I'm shaking my hands like this. And I said,

52:38.000 --> 52:41.760
 I'm not even, this is, I'm not faking this dude. I know that's literally, I cannot stop shaking.

52:42.320 --> 52:47.680
 I said, that scared the Evelyn out of me. Yeah. But you, but it scares you afterwards.

52:49.200 --> 52:52.560
 You don't, during it, you're not, I'm not, you don't have time to think about that. You're doing

52:52.560 --> 52:58.240
 it. You got to do as we, you know, kind of the quote from Tom Hanks and what's that, the girl's

52:58.240 --> 53:03.200
 baseball movie where he goes, there's no crying in baseball. Well, that's our joke. There's no

53:03.200 --> 53:06.800
 crying in naval aviation. I said, you can fly around and cry all you want at night. But,

53:06.800 --> 53:10.960
 but you know, there's only one pilot in those airplanes and you got to land it. So you cry

53:10.960 --> 53:15.200
 all you want, wipe the tears away, you know, put on your big kid pants and it's, it's time to,

53:15.200 --> 53:19.840
 it's time to, you know, man up and land the, land the jet. Sorry for the romantic question,

53:19.840 --> 53:27.440
 but going back to the, the kid that dreamed to fly, what's it like to fly an airplane?

53:28.320 --> 53:35.840
 What it looks incredible as a human, like a descendant of eight, I sit here on land and

53:35.840 --> 53:40.000
 look up at you guys. It seems incredibly human being can do that.

53:40.960 --> 53:43.600
 You know, people ask, you know, I'll be sitting around with my friends and they're like,

53:43.600 --> 53:50.400
 well, as I said, the greatest job on the planet. I said, you know, it's, it's an office with a

53:50.400 --> 53:58.000
 view because you're sitting in a glass. You can do, you know, it's like roller coasters,

53:58.000 --> 54:01.440
 you go, oh, it does all these cool stuff. So we take people flying every once in a while.

54:01.440 --> 54:04.640
 And it's like, oh, yeah, I like roller coaster. Like, oh, no, take any roller coaster,

54:04.640 --> 54:10.080
 coolest roller coaster you've ever been on and multiply it by a thousand. I said, it's an experience,

54:10.640 --> 54:15.600
 you know, to put your body under, you know, you know, the jets rated at seven and a half,

54:15.600 --> 54:20.880
 but it'll pull up to 8.1 before it overstresses depends on fuel weight. So, I mean, you routinely

54:20.880 --> 54:26.720
 get up there towards eight Gs. To be able to do that to your body, I mean, it takes a toll,

54:26.720 --> 54:32.320
 like I can't really turn my head real good anymore and stuff like that. But would I trade it? I mean,

54:32.320 --> 54:36.320
 it was a childhood dream. And how many people get to do that? You know, professional, I want to be

54:36.320 --> 54:40.720
 an NFL, you know, and you end up to the NFL, which is a very small percentage with, well,

54:40.720 --> 54:46.880
 I want to fly jets and, and to fly, you know, at the time when I was flying the Super Hornets that

54:46.880 --> 54:50.320
 we had on our squadron were brand new, like literally right out of the factory, I'd come off

54:50.320 --> 54:54.560
 our first Super Hornet cruise, we had went to the Boeing factory in St. Louis where they were

54:54.560 --> 54:58.000
 building my new jets that I was going to get and actually signed the inside of one of the wings

54:58.800 --> 55:01.760
 while they were putting it together. So I'm meeting the people that are putting the jet

55:01.760 --> 55:05.600
 together that's going to get delivered to me in a couple of months that I'm going to fly. So

55:07.120 --> 55:14.000
 just, I mean, the whole of it is incredible. I'll tell you what, when I left, when I decided to

55:14.000 --> 55:21.440
 walk away. Yeah, do you miss it? I told myself I wouldn't. I promised myself that, you know,

55:21.440 --> 55:26.800
 once you get through your O5 command, you're flying really starts to tag to come down. You know,

55:26.800 --> 55:31.280
 even if you and you're an airplane commander, which is we call them CAG, carrier group commander,

55:32.720 --> 55:36.880
 you're not flying as much as like the normal pilots, nor should you be. I mean, there's young

55:36.880 --> 55:40.800
 people that are coming up and it's training your relief because that's the next generation. So

55:40.800 --> 55:46.400
 like currently, I have friends of mine that we serve together, their kids are flying Super

55:46.400 --> 55:51.520
 Hornets, right? So to me, that's really neat because I watched them when they were little.

55:51.520 --> 55:56.880
 Yeah. And now, you know, one of them who was good friends, I won't get his last name, but Joey,

55:57.920 --> 56:03.520
 who lived down the street from us, was a top gun instructor. And I'm like, hey, Joey's a top gun.

56:04.240 --> 56:08.080
 You know, and I'm like, that's cool. Because, you know, I went there and I knew him, he would come

56:08.080 --> 56:12.720
 down to my house. And now to see these kids that are, because typically military breeds military,

56:12.720 --> 56:17.440
 you know, because the kids grew up in it. I mean, the only reason that my son is not doing it is

56:17.440 --> 56:23.360
 he's colorblind. So it disqualifies you for being a pilot, being a seal, because he'd talked about

56:23.360 --> 56:28.320
 doing that because he's an incredible swimmer and he likes doing that stuff and water polo player.

56:29.040 --> 56:34.800
 But he's, you know, both of my kids are, well, my daughter is a doctor and my son's in his third

56:34.800 --> 56:41.120
 year or so. But there's a, I suppose, I mean, from my perspective, a bittersweet handover

56:42.000 --> 56:47.040
 of this incredible experience of flying to the younger generation. So you don't, you told

56:47.040 --> 56:50.160
 yourself you're not going to miss it. You miss it?

56:51.040 --> 56:55.600
 There are days I do. When I hear jets, like if I'm around a base or a jet flies over,

56:56.560 --> 57:01.760
 but I have all the memory. So I can look at it and go, it can't go on forever. You know,

57:02.960 --> 57:06.000
 Tom Brady can't play football. There's going to come a time where he has to stop.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.600
 I know, he seems to have done it for a long time.

57:08.160 --> 57:11.600
 But, you know, typically when you look at ego, I had the opportunity,

57:11.600 --> 57:18.400
 and I think as automation moves on, especially with AI, that, you know, when will, when will

57:18.400 --> 57:23.440
 the last manfighter be built? You know, and that's that big question. You know, we just did F35.

57:23.440 --> 57:28.880
 It's over budget. It's seven years late. There's all kinds of issues when we try and do it.

57:28.880 --> 57:32.960
 And then you look at some of the new stuff that's coming out that the Air Force is working on with

57:32.960 --> 57:40.560
 smaller, cheaper, a treatable platforms that you can go, oh, we can, because if you don't put a man

57:40.560 --> 57:45.760
 in the box or a person, because there's a lot of incredibly talented women that do this too.

57:46.960 --> 57:52.000
 So I'll just say that as person. Yeah. So we say man and he, we mean both men and women,

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
 because offline you've told me about a lot of incredible women that flown. So it's,

57:56.000 --> 58:02.320
 I had, I had three, three female, actually four, one of them didn't fly anymore. She actually lives

58:02.320 --> 58:06.880
 right around here. She, she's, she ended up going into aircraft maintenance when she couldn't fly

58:06.880 --> 58:14.640
 anymore. One of the girls who everyone knows is incredibly, she's one of the most gifted people

58:14.640 --> 58:18.720
 I've ever met in my life. She is the vice president of Amazon Air. You can see her on TV or named

58:18.720 --> 58:25.840
 Sarah. Incredible. And then I had a page who ended up taking command. She got out of fighters and

58:25.840 --> 58:30.960
 went into other platforms. And she was a commanding officer. And then the other one is a,

58:30.960 --> 58:37.600
 a, teaches leadership and she is all three of them, actually all four of the women that were

58:37.600 --> 58:40.720
 direct. I'm home not forgetting. I don't think I'm forgetting someone.

58:41.840 --> 58:46.320
 Incredibly, incredibly talented and a great addition to the ready room. So anyone who gets

58:46.320 --> 58:50.000
 into the, oh, you know, women can't do it. That's all total horse crap. Hey, you know,

58:50.000 --> 58:54.400
 we can talk about the original integration and stuff, which was not done well by the military

58:54.400 --> 59:00.800
 nor the Navy. So women can fly as good as the guys. Yeah. You can't tell if you pass another

59:00.800 --> 59:05.440
 airplane, you can't tell if there's a man or a woman in it. It really comes down to stick and

59:05.440 --> 59:12.560
 throttle the ability to extrapolate where the vehicle is going to be, where the airplane would

59:12.560 --> 59:16.640
 be. If you're fighting another one, you have to be able to think fast. Anyone has those characteristics

59:17.200 --> 59:20.800
 can do it. And then I think most important besides that, there has to be a desire.

59:20.800 --> 59:25.840
 Yeah. And I'm not saying that everyone, if you took, because we used to track. So when I ran,

59:25.840 --> 59:29.760
 we call it the RAG, it's the replacement air group. It's where, so the, the Super Hornet

59:29.760 --> 59:33.840
 Training Squadron, there's two of them. There's one on the East Coast, 106. And there's one on the

59:33.840 --> 59:39.040
 West Coast, which is VFA 122. 122 is the first one. So I ended up going there and I ended up

59:39.040 --> 59:44.400
 being the operations officer and training officer. Okay. So we tracked the last hundred students.

59:45.520 --> 59:49.200
 Right. So everyone goes, ah, it's funny to hear students talk because, oh, he's awesome.

59:49.200 --> 59:54.320
 He's great. If you took the hundred, there's three at the top of the list that are just

59:54.320 --> 59:58.640
 naturally gifted aviators. They're well, well, well above average. It's like the person in

59:58.640 --> 1:00:04.080
 a math class that sits down in complex math and they just get it. You know, at the bottom,

1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:07.920
 there's the three at the bottom that are going to struggle and there's a good chance they won't

1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:12.400
 get out. And if they do get out, they're going to have to work really hard to just maintain

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:16.960
 kind of average. Sometimes it's just the way your mind works. Not everyone is good at everything.

1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:23.280
 If you took the 94 of them in the middle, they're within one mean deviation of, you know, it's there.

1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:27.920
 They're all, you know, it's a, the bell curve doesn't look real good. It's just a big hump and it

1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:33.440
 comes back down and everyone's right there within one mean deviation. And then you have the outliers

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:36.240
 usually not on the high side because they're going to get through, but the outliers on the

1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:41.280
 low side that don't make it through. So for the most part, the Navy does a really good job as

1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:45.120
 does the Air Force of screening. So now what they do, when I went, you just showed up and

1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:51.040
 you started. Now what you do is you actually go fly a Piper Warriors low wing to see, can you,

1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:55.840
 are you adaptable to this? And there's an evaluation that goes through. And then if you

1:00:55.840 --> 1:00:59.760
 hit a certain mark, then you're good to go. And then they put you into primary. It's kind of like a,

1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:04.320
 it's like a precheck, you know, like the preset, the pre SAT to go, Hey, how am I going to do on

1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:09.760
 the SAT? It's, it's very similar to that, but it's more of a hand skill. Can you adapt? Because

1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:14.160
 although we live in three dimensions, like this table is not, you know, we, this is, you know,

1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:19.200
 this is all has depth with all that. We're, it's really relative to aviation. We are two

1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:25.280
 dimensional, very two dimensional. Can you explain that? So our perception is actually

1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:32.080
 more limited than the, than that of an aviator. Very much. And here's why. So we look at, let's

1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:35.760
 look at a tall building. Let's look at one World Trade Center in New York, because that's the,

1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:41.360
 everyone knows what it looks like, big tall building. That's what maybe 1800 feet tall,

1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:45.840
 even the Burj El Dubai, which is like what 20, some hundred feet tall, it's not that big.

1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:52.000
 So a super hornet to do what a split S is, which is I'm flying, I'm just going to roll the airplane

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:56.880
 upside down. And then I'm going to do basically a C, the letter C, I'm going to go in the top and

1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:01.200
 out the bottom. So, and I'm just getting basically a vertical displacement of the airplane. So I'm

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:06.960
 going from high to low. It's very, very tight. And it doesn't in about roughly about 2,500 feet.

1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:12.080
 Give or take a little. So you go, that is, that is a really tight vertical turn.

1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:18.000
 For example, the A6 in order to do that was about 9,000 feet. And we look at a building

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:23.200
 that's 2,000 feet high and think that is tall. Right. All right. So in aviation sense, when

1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:27.920
 you're starting to do vertical displacement maneuvers going from 35,000 feet down to 20,000

1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:32.320
 feet in a matter of seconds and maneuvering the airplane, because the human brain thinks

1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:37.120
 we really are, we like to be flat. I see what you mean. We think 2D. So if I'm fighting,

1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:41.440
 how you really get an advantage when you're fighting another airplane is to work in the

1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:45.920
 vertical because most people will do like one move in the vertical and then they want to start

1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:49.120
 to flatten out because that's where we're comfortable. Yeah. So they're profound. Do

1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:55.440
 you still think in like stacks of 2D layers or no? Or do you, do you truly start to think in

1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:04.880
 that third dimension like the rich 3D world of like a fighting? Like do you start to actually be able

1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:11.120
 to really experience the 3D nature? You do because you have to project where you're going to be. So

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:14.960
 you have to know the performance of the airplane knowing that, hey, if I do this maneuver that

1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:19.840
 I'm going to go, it's kind of like when I, when I talk about when we were chasing the Tic Tac.

1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:23.440
 So the Tic Tac's coming up and I'm at about, you know, and I've been doing this for

1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:28.800
 at the time 16 years. So I'm looking and I'm going, hey, I'm here, he's there on the other side of

1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:31.920
 the circle. I'm going to do a vertical displacement. I'm going to go like this. I'm going to cut

1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:35.600
 across the circle and I'm not going to him. I'm going out in front of him. I'm going over here

1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:38.320
 because I know that by the time I get through this maneuver, that's where he's going to be. And

1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:43.200
 I'm trying to, you know, basically join up on him. But I also had to look at it to go,

1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:46.160
 do I have enough altitude to do this? Because what I didn't, if we're here and I do this,

1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:49.680
 I'm going to end up over here and he's going to be above me. And then, you know, I have to get

1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:54.960
 that energy back to get up to him. And when you're doing a max performance, it's a trade. So you have

1:03:56.240 --> 1:03:59.760
 this, this is really important when you're, when you're fighting airplanes and you're really

1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:04.880
 max performing. So when you go to an air show and you see the air demo, he's literally playing

1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:08.800
 with it. He's got a finite amount of energy, right? He can add some with the motors and stuff,

1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:13.440
 but you're, what you're really doing is it's a trade off and you can trade off kinetic energy,

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:18.320
 speed for altitude, which gives you potential energy. The other piece is, is I can trade some

1:04:18.320 --> 1:04:23.440
 of that kinetic energy for performance. Because I know if I do a nice easy turn, the airplane will

1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:28.640
 make it at what doesn't bleed energy. But I know if I do a real tight, that 2,500 foot split s,

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:33.040
 that it's going to cost me energy. So if I enter the split s at 200 knots and I do it right,

1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:37.680
 I'm going to come out at the bottom at probably 200 knots. Although I lost 2,500 feet of potential

1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:43.920
 energy, I converted that to that to kinetic and that kinetic was transitioned and bled off the wings

1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:49.360
 in order for me to get that high performance turn. And you have to constantly evaluate where you're

1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:53.840
 at and it's your overall energy package. So you can have a guy that's behind you that looks like

1:04:53.840 --> 1:04:59.280
 he's going to kill you, but if this jet is at 400 knots and this jet is at 110 knots, this jet's

1:04:59.280 --> 1:05:04.400
 just going to pull away, drive around and kill him in about 30 seconds, right? It's, it's overall

1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:08.720
 energy package. And that's that you got to be constantly evaluating where you're at. And this

1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:12.720
 is that 80% solution. Can I afford to do this or not? Yes, no. And you have literally a split second

1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:18.960
 to make the decision. The most incredible dance of human decision making is just incredible.

1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:23.680
 I know a million people want me to talk about Tic Tac and I definitely will, but let me ask the

1:05:23.680 --> 1:05:32.560
 one last ridiculous subjective question. What's the greatest plane ever made in history?

1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:39.920
 You don't get to like. From pure speed, I would say SR 71. I think it's an engineering marvel

1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:44.800
 that was actually developed in the 50s by Kelly Johnson, you know, Skunkworks for what that was

1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:49.680
 able to do. And then when you get into history of it, you know how they actually built the CIA

1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:54.960
 actually made like six companies in order to buy the titanium from Russia to bring it back and

1:05:54.960 --> 1:06:00.160
 build an airplane out of titanium that we would fly over Russia. To me, that's, it's an incredible

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:05.040
 engineering marvel. I think that like the X 15, you know, by the way, that's, that's sorry, sorry

1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:12.640
 to interrupt this, SR 71 still holds the, the speed record for any plane as far as I can

1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:17.280
 understand. Yeah, what's funny when you get into it is it's, remember, fast is relative.

1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:24.640
 When I say that, I mean, so if you're going 3000 miles an hour, 100 feet above the ground,

1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:29.920
 you're going 3000 miles an hour through, you know, that's how fast you're going.

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:33.600
 When you get up to altitude, there's an indicated airspeed and there's a, you know,

1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:38.880
 your ground speed. So your indicated airspeed is really how fast the air is going past your airplane.

1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:45.840
 Well, the air is so thin up there, you may only be showing like 300 knots, but at 300 knots,

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:50.640
 you're really doing 2500 miles an hour over the ground. So, you know, like, we would take the

1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:55.280
 airplanes up to 50,000 feet when we had to do full, the maintenance check flights on them.

1:06:55.280 --> 1:06:59.760
 So when you're doing 200, you know, and you know, some odd knots, you're, it's actually slow for

1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:03.760
 the airplane. It's, you know, you're getting, you know, it's kind of like, it's not, you know,

1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:07.760
 there's maneuvering speeds. You know that if I hit a certain speed and a super hornet that I have

1:07:07.760 --> 1:07:12.400
 the full capability of the airfoil. If I'm below that speed, I'm going to stall the airfoil before

1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:18.080
 I get to the maximum G. Okay. So when you look at something like that, you go, well, is it really

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:23.760
 going fast? And when you look at an SR 71 that's flying upwards of, you know, 70 plus thousand

1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:28.720
 feet, the air is so thin, you know, just like the X 15, you can get to a much higher speed,

1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:32.400
 but the relative speed of the air going over you is actually relatively low.

1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:35.280
 So the stresses on the airframe are not like they would be if you were down low.

1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:39.920
 But because you're going fast to get enough air over your pedostatic system to show that

1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:45.680
 you're going 300 knots, you're, you're screaming. I mean, the fastest I ever got was I was with the,

1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:50.240
 well, soon to be vice admiral white. So we had taken a check flight and,

1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:56.320
 and I got it up to 1.78. I got a super hornet up to Mach 1.78. And it was,

1:07:56.320 --> 1:07:59.120
 and we were just right by Pebble Beach too. And then it...

1:07:59.120 --> 1:08:03.680
 What's that feel like? When you get that fast, it started, to me, it got a little bit weird

1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:09.120
 because you realize in your brain, and I did, that there's no out. If something happens, I

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:13.040
 can't eject. The ejection would kill me. Isn't that kind of liberating in a way?

1:08:14.720 --> 1:08:18.880
 Or maybe not. You always want to push the limit. You know, it's like, how fast, I could have got

1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:22.720
 going faster. It was, it was literally still accelerating when I stopped, but I had, it was

1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:28.160
 fuel limited and space limited because I, you know, I'm off the coast of California,

1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:32.480
 Big Sur, and I'm going and I can see Pebble Beach out in the distance, you know, the whole Monterey

1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:39.200
 Peninsula. And you're doing almost 18 miles a minute. I mean, you're screaming. I mean,

1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:42.480
 that's, and then you have to turn, well, the airplane didn't have anything on it. It was

1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:46.560
 a slipped off super hornet. So it was basically just the airplane, no pylons, no pods, no nothing.

1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:50.240
 And then we had to get it turned around because we got to go to the exit point for the area.

1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:55.280
 And I'm trying to get it down below to subsonic. And there's a bunch of things that are disabled,

1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:58.480
 like the speed brakes that normally we pop out when you're going that fast. They don't,

1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:02.000
 because the super hornet really doesn't have speed brakes. It deforms the flight controls.

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:07.840
 They don't function. So you really, you're trying to maneuver. And when you're going that fast,

1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:16.080
 you can't turn because a 7G turn at 1.5 Mach is a pretty big turn. So it's just, it's crazy.

1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:21.360
 It's incredible that a human can do this. And a human can engineer that, the system,

1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:27.760
 which allows another human to control that system. It's, to me, it's, I think it's just,

1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:32.320
 it's, it's one, it's a great experience. Was it sad to see the SR71 go? I think it was during

1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:38.560
 your career. I mean, do you guys romanticize the different planes? We would see it flying when I

1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:44.240
 was flying Hornets because we, West Coast flies in, it's called R2508, which is, covers the

1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:49.600
 Navy China Lake area and Edwards. It's a huge area. It's, it's actually, I think the, we had a guy

1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:52.640
 from Switzerland come out because they were, they had Hornets and he's like, this is bigger in our

1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:57.760
 whole country because it's a pretty big area in California that you fly. But you would see the

1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:02.320
 SR71s, they had a loop because NASA was flying them out of Palmdale and they would take off and

1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:06.160
 they'd go up towards Washington state and Montana and they do a loop. And so you'd see them coming

1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:10.080
 back down. They descend out of, you know, above 60,000. You'd see them, you'd, they get contrails,

1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:13.600
 you know, the white lines behind airplanes. They'd come down and hit the tanker and then they'd go

1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:20.080
 back up. So it was cool to be able to see them in my lifetime flying. But, you know, I think with

1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:28.080
 money, age, the advent of satellites, you know, because they're everywhere now. I mean,

1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:32.880
 you've got commercial companies putting satellites up. How much of that need was really there?

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:36.000
 Because you got to remember when those things started in the 50s, Sputnik wasn't flying around.

1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:39.840
 You know, it was, it was the U2 and the SR71 that were out there doing that work.

1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:45.440
 So at the time it was needed, it was at the, if you think about it really, it was an incredible

1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:50.720
 feat of aviation for that time. I mean, literally we have yet to pass that. And you also asked,

1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:53.680
 well, is there a need to pass that? I go, I don't know, we got stuff in space. So

1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:58.560
 do we need to make an airplane that goes that fast? I think the next one is you get into the

1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:01.680
 hypersonics where you don't have to put a person in, it does all kinds of crazy stuff.

1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:04.080
 You know, the work with automation, all that kind of stuff. Yeah.

1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:11.600
 So one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is you happen to be one of, at least in my view,

1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:19.840
 one of the most credible witnesses in history of somebody who's witnessed a UFO, literally,

1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:27.920
 an identified flying object. And not only witnessed, but got to, how do you put it like

1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:34.720
 chase it essentially? Chase it. Chase it. So let me just lay out, I think it's easier than you

1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:40.880
 telling the story, maybe me and my dumb simpleton ways trying to explain the stories I understand

1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:50.720
 it. And then maybe you can correct me. So on November 10th, 2004, the USS Princeton,

1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:56.960
 which is one of the carriers. That's a cruiser. It's a cruiser. So you can't land on a.

1:11:56.960 --> 1:12:01.120
 No, helicopter has a helicopter pad on the back. Got you. So it has weapons on it. Okay,

1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:05.920
 got you. It shoots the missiles up, but it has a nice radar just incredible spy one system,

1:12:05.920 --> 1:12:12.400
 phased array, four panels. So it looks in quadrants. Perfect. So they started noticing

1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:18.400
 on November 10th that there is a few objects flying around at 28,000 feet with speed of,

1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:24.240
 what I guess is considered a low speed of 120 miles an hour. I don't know what that's in knots,

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:30.880
 but on the coast of California. So, and they kept detecting these objects for just about a week.

1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:38.720
 Then comes in like your part of the story, which is on November 14th,

1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:50.080
 from the, I guess it's from the USS Nimitz. You flew and witnessed a 40 foot long white

1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:55.600
 tic tac shaped object with no wings, flying in ways you've never thought possible.

1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:02.320
 And in some interview somewhere, you said, I think it was not from this world. So there's

1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:09.520
 a mysterious aspect to this object, to this entire situation. There's videos involved, the

1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:20.400
 video of a flare forward looking infrared receiver, as also the visible lights, you can switch

1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:28.720
 as a TV mode. So that gives you visible light and then as an IR mode. And chat Underwood recorded

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:33.440
 that video. So, and those are the videos that were released by the Pentagon later, one of the

1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:42.720
 three videos, the two other videos go fast and gimbal were recorded in 2000, something 14 or

1:13:42.720 --> 1:13:51.840
 15 on the east coast of the United States. They had different kinds of objects, but they're weird

1:13:51.840 --> 1:14:00.240
 in the same kind of way in terms of at least the videos and the experiences that people have described

1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:08.640
 or similar in the degree of weirdness. But the differences is actually on the east coast of

1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:15.520
 2014 case, very few people have spoken about it. And even in your situation, very few people have

1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:22.320
 spoken about it. So there's a mystery to it. But it's in some sense, this is a quite simple story

1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:31.200
 without much resolution to the mystery. And it's fascinating. And there's a lot of opinions,

1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:37.200
 there's division of opinions, because it's a mysterious, I mean, it's truly is a UFO in

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:48.160
 the sense that you AP, what is it, I unidentified aerial phenomena. So can you maybe correct me

1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:53.360
 on any of the things that got wrong, elaborate on some key things and describe that experience in

1:14:53.360 --> 1:15:01.760
 general? So here's what I know. So yeah, we went out on our mission to go train. And they canceled

1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:06.240
 the mission. And they sent us on, there's all kinds of rumors out here. There's all kinds of,

1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:11.360
 after this has come out. So originally, it was the four of us. There's two jets, two people in each

1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:19.200
 jet, their F18Fs. Okay. There is no video from our event. It was all four sets of eyeballs staring

1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:23.520
 at this thing. And then when we came back and told it, when Chad and his pilot took off,

1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:27.360
 that's when Chad got the video of it. And we're like, that's it. That's exactly, that's it.

1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:32.720
 So when you say eyeballs, you mean literally your eyes are seeing a thing.

1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:36.240
 Yeah. So as we're flying out, we get, we get vectored, they come up and tell us,

1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:39.520
 hey, we're going to cancel training. This is a USS Princeton. So this is the Seages cruiser.

1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:47.760
 So we're talking to one controller who is like, Hey, sir, first you ask what ordinance we have

1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:50.960
 on board. And I laugh because we don't carry live ordinance and training typically, because

1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:54.880
 bad shit stuff happens. Usually someone forgets to put a switch on and then the missile comes off

1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:59.600
 and hits a good airplane and it's not good. So we had what's called a catam 9, which is really

1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:03.760
 just a blue two with the aim night seeker on the front of it, which is an IR missile.

1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:07.760
 So there's only two ways to get it off. You can beat it off of the sledgehammer,

1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:11.760
 you can take this thing and you put a wrench in it and unlocks the lugs and pulls the lugs back

1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:16.480
 in that holding on when it really fires the impulse from the engine actually throws the lugs

1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:21.760
 forward and breaks that release and it comes off down the rail. That's how it works. So they said,

1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:27.840
 Hey, well, we have real world tasking. So as we're going out, my wingman, the other pilot,

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:33.600
 she maneuvers the airplane to the left hand side of me. So she's kind of stepped up like this.

1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:38.960
 And I'll use your mic box to start. So as we're going out, their calling ranges are called bra calls,

1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:44.240
 bearing range and altitude. And they're telling us, Hey, it's at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40 miles

1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:50.000
 and 30 miles. So they're saying, Hey, two, seven, zero, 30, 20,000. That's all they say. So we got

1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.520
 our radars and we had to, we had to mechanically scan radars at the time, APG 73. Good piece of

1:16:55.520 --> 1:17:01.760
 gear, APG 79 new ones way better. But anyway, and I apologize if I interrupt the story. Hopefully

1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:06.720
 it's useful. But they're telling you a location of a thing that you should look at. Yep. They're

1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:10.000
 telling us they have a contact on their radar. They don't know what it is. They just have a blip.

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.760
 They have a little blip. Well, they've been watching these things. And what he told me is

1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:16.240
 they had been looking at these things as we're driving. I said, sir, we've been tracking these

1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:20.080
 things for about two weeks. That's we had been at sea for two weeks. Because this is the first time

1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:22.400
 we've had planes airborne. We want you to go see what these are.

1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:26.720
 Gotcha. So they kind of interrupt the mission to say, check it out.

1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:32.640
 That's exactly it. So we start driving out there. And as we get down to, he's going, you know,

1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:36.800
 20 miles, 15 miles, 10 miles. And then you get to a point where they call merge plot,

1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:41.440
 which means we are inside of the resolution cell of the radar, because radars don't see everything.

1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:47.280
 So they have a range and they have an azimuth resolution, right? So, and it's basically think

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:51.760
 of a little cube. So they can, and the whole sky is made of all these little cubes. And they're

1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:56.000
 looking. So if you're inside a cube with something and you're both inside the same little cube,

1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:01.200
 then the radar can only see one thing. Does that make sense? So they call merge plot. Well,

1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:05.760
 when we say merge plot to us, it means he's right around something's around you, get your head out.

1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:09.600
 So we're not looking at radar scopes anymore and the wizards, the wizards can look, but everyone,

1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:13.520
 it's heads out. When they say merge plot, you're done looking at your displays inside,

1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:18.880
 you're doing this and you're trying to find it. So as we look out to the right and you look high

1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:22.480
 and low, because he could be anywhere from the surface all the way up. Now, keep in mind, the

1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:27.760
 ship is like probably 60 miles away. So it can't see the surface and you can do your standard

1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:33.040
 radar horizon calculation and go, hey, it's the thing is 40 feet off the water, the panel.

1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:37.840
 Can he really see, you know, there are radars that can see around the curve, but let's just say that

1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:44.640
 it can't at this time. So you go, is it, you know, where is it at? So as we're looking around,

1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:50.560
 we see, you know, this is a, it's a clear day. There's no clouds and there's no white caps.

1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:56.640
 It's just a calm, it's actually a perfect day. If you owned a sailboat, it was that five to 10

1:18:56.640 --> 1:18:59.760
 knots of wind and you just want to kind of go out there and you're not going to get beat up and

1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:02.720
 have white water come out. It was the perfect day to own a sailboat.

1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:07.040
 How many miles out do you see like seven, like you see just, it's a clear day.

1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:10.480
 That's 50. It's unrestricted visibility. You can see literally all the way to the horizon. It's

1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:14.960
 just clear. It's nothing. And we're basically off the coast. If you look at a map and you go

1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:21.120
 San Diego and then inside of Mexico, we're kind of in between that. And we're probably about, by

1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:26.960
 the time this all hits, we're priced, I don't know, 80, 100, I don't know, but somewhere out,

1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:29.120
 it's pretty far off the coast. Perfect visibility.

1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:32.800
 But from 20,000 feet, you'd be amazed. You can do the calculation. You can see stuff,

1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:36.880
 you know, you'll see land 50 miles away. You can see, you know, and when you're looking at

1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:40.400
 a continent, it's really easy to see you're not looking at an island. I mean, you're looking

1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:44.320
 at Mexico. And you can see on the white caps in the water, if there is any.

1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:49.680
 Oh yeah, they're easy. Yeah. For us, we look at it because we know if it's natural wind or,

1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:52.960
 so if it's a really white cap windy day, then the ship's just kind of barely be moving when

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:57.200
 we land on it. It makes it actually easier. If the ship has to move or it's got a big weight,

1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:00.800
 because it has to make its own wind when we land, which is the day that it was this day,

1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:04.960
 you go, oh, okay. And it creates what's called, we call it the verbal, but when the air flows

1:20:04.960 --> 1:20:09.440
 across the flight deck, it drops behind the ship, you know? And then it kicks back up.

1:20:09.440 --> 1:20:12.320
 So when you're coming board the land, it's going to make you go up a little bit and then you're

1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:19.440
 going to fall and you got to anticipate that to stand glidesome. So we're pretty conscious of

1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:23.920
 what's going on out there with the waves and the wind. So there's no waves, there's no wind,

1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:30.320
 there's no white caps, and we look down and we see white water. So if you put a piece of land,

1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:34.960
 a sea mount below the surface, like, you know, even 20 feet below the surface that's big enough,

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:39.760
 as the waves come in, you know, waves have height and length. When they come in, that's what happens

1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:44.080
 on the shore. When a wave comes in, it hits and then it starts to collapse and it pushes the wave

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:48.560
 height up because it can't go anymore and then it breaks over the top. And that's where you get the

1:20:48.560 --> 1:20:53.200
 white. So what happens is at sea, when you get a sea mount, you'll see stuff come in, the wave

1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:58.880
 will crash and you'll get white water. You can go out when it's high tide and any one of the coast,

1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:02.880
 you can go out here off of Boston and go, hey, at low tide, I can see those rocks. And at high

1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:05.760
 tide, I can't see the rocks are covered, but there'll be white water around those rocks. You'll

1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:09.120
 be able to tell there's something underneath the surface. Does that make sense? Yep. So that's

1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:12.960
 what it was. We see, we don't see an object because there's all kinds of, oh, they saw this,

1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:17.200
 they saw another craft below the way. We didn't see anything below the water. We just saw white

1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:21.520
 water. But the white water, and I like to shape it, you can say it was a cross. I say it's about

1:21:21.520 --> 1:21:27.360
 the size of a 737. So it looks like if you took a 737, put it about 15, 20 feet below the water,

1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:30.560
 so the wave is breaking over the top and you're going to get white water where the plane is at,

1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:36.080
 you'd see this kind of shape. So it looks like a cross. So as we're looking down off the right

1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:41.360
 side, the back seater in the airplane, Jim, says, this is that talking in partials again,

1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:45.520
 he says, hey, Skipper, do you, and that's about what he gets out of his mouth. And I go, what the

1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:50.080
 hell is that? Do you see that essentially is what he's saying? So we see the white water,

1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:53.360
 and that's what draws our eyes down there. Otherwise, we'd have never seen it. So we see

1:21:53.360 --> 1:21:56.240
 this white water. I would have loved to see the look on your face when you see that.

1:21:56.240 --> 1:22:00.800
 And then we see this little white tic tac because we're about 20,000 feet above it,

1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:05.680
 and it's doing, it's going basically north, south, and then east, west, north, and it's abrupt. It's

1:22:05.680 --> 1:22:10.960
 very abrupt. So it's not like a helicopter. If a helicopter's going sideways and it goes

1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:14.640
 once, it's going sideways, left and right, what it'll do is it'll go, it's got a speed,

1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:18.480
 it slows down because there's inertia and it stops and then it goes back the other way.

1:22:18.480 --> 1:22:20.880
 This thing's not. It's like left, right, left, right with no...

1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:26.880
 So moving in ways that doesn't, doesn't feel intuitive to you at all of the things you've

1:22:26.880 --> 1:22:32.240
 seen in the past. So as a pilot, the first thing you think is it's a helicopter, right?

1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:35.840
 So you go, oh, what is it? Because when we see it, it's moving. We're like, oh, helicopter.

1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:39.280
 So the first thing you look forward to see if it's a helicopter when they're doing that,

1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:43.600
 because usually when they get down there towards that 50 feet, you'll get rotor wash.

1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:47.040
 You see it in the movies when the helicopter's by the water, it kicks, the water comes up the

1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:50.720
 sides because the downdraft, you know, like a thunderstorm will do that, it pushes the

1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:55.600
 air down and then it has to come up the sides. So you see it and you go, well, there's no,

1:22:55.600 --> 1:23:00.080
 there's no rotor wash. What is that thing? So by this time we're driving around. So as we're,

1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:03.280
 if we were at the six o clock, we're driving around towards that nine o clock position and

1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:06.720
 we're just watching this thing. And it's just, it's still pointed north south and it's going

1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:10.480
 left, right. And it's kind of moving around the object. And if it had, if I had to say it

1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:14.800
 biased itself, it was biased towards the bottom half. So if you've got the east west and then

1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:18.640
 the north south kind of across, it's hanging out on the southern thing that's hanging out.

1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:21.760
 It's just kind of moving around up down left and it's crossing over it. It's going up. It's just

1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:28.320
 kind of, so now we're like, what the hell is that? So then I go, hey, I'm going to go check it out.

1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:32.880
 And the other pilot says, I'm going to stay up here. And I said, yeah, stay up high. Cause now

1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:38.640
 we get, we get a different perspective. So she's up here and I'm down here as I'm descending.

1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:44.480
 She can watch cause right now all I'm watching is the tic tac. She can watch me and the tic tac.

1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:47.760
 So she gets a God's eye view of everything that's going on, which is really important.

1:23:47.760 --> 1:23:52.560
 You can hear people say it's high cover, whatever. She's watching me, which is,

1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:57.120
 it's perfect as the story goes on. Cause it gives us two perspectives, you know,

1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:01.440
 of a perspective that's about 8,000 feet above us when that thing disappears. And they don't,

1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:04.880
 you know, cause if it's just like, oh, I lost it. And they go, no, it's over to the right.

1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:09.200
 We can still see it. We all lost it at the same time. So as we come down, we get to about 12

1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:13.360
 o clock and I'm descending and it's an easy descent. I'm doing about 300 knots, which is a

1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:17.200
 really good airspeed for the airplane for maneuvering. Cause I have, I have everything

1:24:17.200 --> 1:24:22.480
 available to me at that speed. So I'm coming down and as I get to 12 o clock as the tic

1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:27.360
 tics do this, it literally, it's like, it's aware of us and it just goes and it kind of points

1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:31.280
 out towards the West and starts coming up. So now it's obviously knows that we're there,

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:35.520
 whatever this thing is, it knows that we're there. So as we drive around, it's coming up and I'm

1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:38.160
 just coming down and we're just, I'm just watching it. Now you gotta remember this whole thing is

1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:42.400
 like, this is like five minutes. This is not like a, we saw it and it was gone or, oh, I saw

1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:48.400
 lights in the sky and they were gone. We watched this thing on a crystal clear day with four

1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:52.960
 trained observers. Watch this thing fly around. So we're like, okay. So I get over to the eight o

1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:56.960
 clock position and I'm a little, I'm a couple thousand feet above it and it's about, so I'm

1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:01.600
 probably at about 15 K. I think it is. I think that's my story is about 15. It's just estimating.

1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:08.320
 So you can see it's really easy descent because. So what's 15 K 15,000 feet. I thought it was 8,000.

1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:14.720
 The other plane ends up about, so they're still at about 20,000 feet. So they're

1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:18.800
 driving around. And I'm descending, they're staying up there. So I'm kind of doing this as

1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:23.520
 they drive around. Okay. So I'm looking at this thing and it's about the two o clock position.

1:25:23.520 --> 1:25:27.040
 We're about the eight o clock position and I'm like, oh, I've got, I've got enough altitudes.

1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:30.160
 I'm going to, I'm going to cut across the circle. I tell the guy in my back seat,

1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:33.760
 dude, I'm going to, I'm going to do this. He's like, go for it, skip because I was a skipper.

1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:40.000
 So I cut across the bottom. So I'm kind of almost coming out co altitude as this thing's

1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:45.600
 coming out. I'm going to meet it and I'm driving and I get to pry. It's, I'm probably about a half

1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:49.120
 mile away, which you think, well, a half mile is pretty far. Half mile in aviation isn't,

1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:53.360
 it's nothing. That's, I mean, you can tell there's a pilot in an airplane. You can see all kinds of

1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:57.840
 stuff at a half mile. You can see pretty good detail. So I'm like, right there and it's coming

1:25:57.840 --> 1:26:01.360
 across my nose. So now I'm basically pointing back towards East. So I'm cutting across because

1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:04.720
 I'm going to the three o clock position. It's at two o clock and I'm going to meet it at three o

1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:09.600
 clock. So as I do this, it goes, it just accelerates and disappears. So it's, this happens at

1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:14.000
 around, estimating about 12,000 feet. So they're at 20. So they've got about 8,000 foot of altitude

1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.200
 above us when this happens. And it just, is it crosses our nose? It just, it accelerates in

1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:23.200
 literally in less than, you know, probably less than a half second. It's just goes, and it's gone.

1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:29.920
 And so we're like, and I had the first thing is, dude, do you guys see it? The other plane's like,

1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:34.080
 it's gone. We don't, we have no idea where it's at. So we kind of spin around real quick. I go,

1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:38.000
 let's see what's down here. And I turn around, we're looking for the white water and we can't,

1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:42.800
 the white water's gone. There's nothing. It's literally all blue. So now you go. And I remember

1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:47.440
 telling the guy in my back seat, I go, dude, I'm, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty weirded

1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:52.480
 out because this is, I mean, you know, I had, at the time, like 30 some hundred hours of flying,

1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:58.480
 I'd been doing it for 18 years. It's nothing like anything you've seen. No, no. So as we turn, we go,

1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:02.880
 well, let's just go back, you know, because now I got to put on my real hat, which we have to train

1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:07.600
 because we're getting ready to deploy to, you know, overseas. So we got to get our training done. So

1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:11.280
 that's my mindset, especially as a CO, because I got to get, I get it training out of the flight

1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:16.160
 time because I'm responsible to do that. So, hey, let's go back. And the guy who's going to be the

1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:20.960
 bad guys is the CO, the Marine Squadron. And so Cheeks is at the other, he's listening to all this

1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:24.800
 happen, you know, because he's just like, because he, they, when he first went out, they were going

1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:29.520
 to do him, but the little Hornets, the legacy Hornets, the F18Cs don't have as much gas as the

1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:33.760
 Super Hornets. So he had launched first and they were going to do him. And then when they knew we

1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:39.120
 were off the deck, they just told him, hey, go to your cap point down south. And we're going to send,

1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:44.720
 we'll pass this off to the Super Hornets. What's the cap point? That's where we hold. So it's called

1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:49.040
 a combat air patrol point. So we're just going to hold at one end. He's going to hold at the other end.

1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:54.000
 It's kind of like, hey, you guys are going to, it's a football field. We're going to sit on one

1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.960
 goal line. He's going to sit on the other goal line. And when they say go, we're going to run at

1:27:56.960 --> 1:28:00.400
 each other and try and do something in the middle of the field and then go back to our set reset

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:05.440
 points. Okay. So you're talking to him. He's listening to the all. He's just listening. We

1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:08.400
 don't talk to him at all. He's just listening. He just dials up because they know that we all

1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:12.400
 know the frequencies. So he's listening to what's going on because he's like, because they canceled

1:28:12.400 --> 1:28:15.040
 training. So what else is he going to do? He's just going to hang out there and do circles while

1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:18.560
 he's waiting for him and his wingman. So they just, they're listening to all this go on.

1:28:18.560 --> 1:28:23.280
 And then at this point, you move on. Yeah, we come back up to train. We go back as we're flying back,

1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:28.560
 the controller, because we're talking to the kid on the Princeton, they're called OSs,

1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:32.720
 they're operation specialists. They're the ones that run the radars. And we're talking to him

1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:36.240
 and he's like, Hey, sir, you're not going to believe this, but that thing is at your cap.

1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:41.120
 It showed back up and just popped up. This is like 60 miles away. It just reappears. We're like,

1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:46.320
 Oh, okay. So we got the radars out. We're looking for it. We get out there. We never see it. We

1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:51.120
 never see it again. We do what we need to do. We come back to the ship. Of course, now we're like,

1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:54.560
 Oh, this is going to be, you know, I told him, I told him, I go, dude, you know, we're going to catch

1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:58.480
 we're going to catch shit for this. When we get back to the ship, words going to get out and we're

1:28:58.480 --> 1:29:03.280
 just going to catch maximum shit. And we did. And it's kind of that joking. You know, so the

1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:07.040
 ship plays movies. We have movies on the boat and they do 12 hours of movies. So they repeat

1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:10.320
 because there's a day check and a night check. So the same movies in the morning and night plays.

1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:14.800
 So you never get to ever get to watch a whole movie on the boat, which drives my wife crazy

1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:18.160
 because I'll watch stuff on TV that way too. I'll be like, Oh, here I've seen this and I'll jump

1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:21.760
 into a movie in the middle and then I'll pick it up later and I'll see the beginning and I'll put

1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:27.600
 it all together because that's how we have to do it because we're so busy. Well, the movies became

1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:34.880
 and I was met in black aliens, Independence Day. Definitely going to catch some shit.

1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:41.440
 Oh, we did. But let me just ask some dumb questions. So just taking because it's

1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:49.200
 whatever, whatever the heck you saw, whatever the heck happened, it's, you know, one of the most

1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:59.040
 fascinating things, events in recent history. So whatever it was, it's interesting to talk about

1:29:59.040 --> 1:30:02.560
 at different kinds of angles. There's no good answers, but it's interesting to ask some dumb

1:30:02.560 --> 1:30:09.280
 questions here. So first of all, you mentioned, see, you saw it at some point, X, Y, and then

1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:14.720
 somebody in the Princeton said, you're not going to believe this, sir. It's at your cap point.

1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:18.080
 Now that's a different place. How the heck did it know what your cap point is?

1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:23.200
 That's a good question. That's the one of you, no one, you know, we don't tell it. We don't

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:27.840
 broadcast it. We have a waypoint in the system. But I don't know, maybe it knew where we were

1:30:27.840 --> 1:30:33.200
 going because we use the same one day after day after day. But it obviously knew. But you never

1:30:33.200 --> 1:30:37.200
 saw it there. Never saw it there. Chad, when he took off, when he got the video, we landed,

1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:41.600
 we told them, hey, look, we just, we just chased this thing. They're like, what? I go,

1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:46.640
 chased it. And they're like, well, I go, dude, and I go, and I told him, I said, dude, get video.

1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:51.360
 And he goes, so, and that's how he is. He's like, oh, I'm going to go. And he was, he was determined

1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:55.760
 that he was going to find this thing. So when you look at his video, and this is the stuff that

1:30:55.760 --> 1:31:00.160
 isn't out that they don't see because not all the, all you see is the FLIR tape. That's the

1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:04.880
 targeting pod, the forward looking infrared receiver. I'll probably overlay the video.

1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:10.560
 When he goes out, it's, you know, what he's looking at on his displays is he has basically

1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:16.000
 two radar displays up. He has azimuth and range on the right one, and he has azimuth and elevation

1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:20.720
 on the left one. So this is called the ASL display. And this is called, this is basically the PPI,

1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:25.360
 which is the, you're at the bottom of it. You're at the bottom of the square. It's really taken

1:31:25.360 --> 1:31:30.080
 this, it's taken a cone because a radar really looks left and right from a point and it squares

1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:35.120
 it out. So the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us because they do this, they square

1:31:35.120 --> 1:31:39.280
 it off. So, so he goes out. And when he first sees it, he gets a radar return on it because

1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:42.720
 when he's not trying to lock it, so the radar's just throwing energy out and getting it, you know,

1:31:42.720 --> 1:31:46.320
 it's a Doppler radar. So when it's in search mode, that's all it's doing. It's going,

1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:49.920
 hell, I can see you. I can see you. And it's looking for return. So he gets a return. So he

1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:53.200
 wants to see what it is because all you get is a little green square unless it builds a track

1:31:53.200 --> 1:31:56.960
 file on it. But a little green square is just sitting there. It's not moving because it's,

1:31:56.960 --> 1:32:02.240
 it's sitting in one spot in space. He locks it up when he goes to lock it up. Now he's putting

1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:06.400
 a bunch of energy on it. But he's telling the radar, stare down that line of sight and whatever's

1:32:06.400 --> 1:32:10.720
 there, I want you to grab it and build a track file on it, which will tell us how high it is,

1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:16.480
 how fast it is and the direction that it's going. Okay. The radar smart enough that when the signal

1:32:16.480 --> 1:32:21.520
 comes back, if it's been messed with, it will tell you, it'll give you indications that I'm being jammed.

1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:25.920
 So that's all it is. As you send the signal out, something, it manipulates the signal either in

1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:29.840
 range and velocity or whatever, and it sends it back. And the radar was smart enough to go,

1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:34.720
 that is not a return that I'm expecting. Something's messing with me. I'm being jammed.

1:32:34.720 --> 1:32:38.720
 And it shows you and it puts strobes up, it gives these lines on the radar and it does some

1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:43.440
 stuff. So you can, well, it does, it goes full into it. It's being jammed at about every mode

1:32:43.440 --> 1:32:47.440
 you can possibly see because everything comes up and the, this aspect gets along. It's all kinds

1:32:47.440 --> 1:32:51.600
 of, I don't want to get into details, but you can tell it's being jammed. So as you said on

1:32:51.600 --> 1:32:55.920
 Rogan, by the way, that jamming is an active war. Active jamming isn't, when you actively jam

1:32:55.920 --> 1:32:59.680
 another platform, yes, it's technically an active war. Feels like you should be freaking out at this

1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:05.600
 point. I mean, so, well, he does it. And then in the back seat, so they don't have a stick and throttle,

1:33:05.600 --> 1:33:09.360
 they have what their sidestick controller, so they can control all the sensors and they can

1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:14.320
 just toggle around and do stuff. So he can, he has the ability to just move one switch real

1:33:14.320 --> 1:33:18.560
 quick and it will go from that azimuth elevation on the radar to the targeting pod. Well, as soon

1:33:18.560 --> 1:33:23.040
 as he commanded the radar to look at that target, the targeting pod goes, oh, what's over there?

1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:26.160
 And it'll stare because it goes down the line of sight because all the systems are hooked together.

1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:31.440
 You can decouple them, but they're going to automatically couple up. So when he castles over,

1:33:31.440 --> 1:33:35.600
 he, it's a switch, it looks like a castle switch was a castle. So when he moves that thing to the

1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:39.040
 left and he swaps the displays out and he says, instead of looking at the radar, I want to look

1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:42.960
 at the targeting pod. He sees it on the targeting pod because the targeting pod is already looking

1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:47.520
 there. And now he's on a passive track because he's not literally sending any energy out. He's

1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:53.600
 just receiving IR energy from the tic tac. And then the system itself will track the pixels

1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:56.640
 and the contrast differences. It depends on what mode you're in. So it says, oh,

1:33:56.640 --> 1:33:59.040
 and that's what those little bars you see in the video where the bars come up left and right.

1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:05.680
 I was doing some vision based tracking. That's exactly what it is. So, and then he goes through

1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:10.320
 changes, zooms, changes the mode. He goes through all the modes. So there's a narrow,

1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:15.600
 medium and wide. So wide is far away, medium and then narrow. And then there's the TV mode.

1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:24.240
 And he goes from IR mode to the TV mode. The cool thing with the TV mode is narrow IR mode

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:28.400
 is only medium TV mode. So you can actually get closer with narrow TV mode. It's got a

1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:33.120
 better zoom capability when you go into TV mode. So he goes through all those things.

1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:35.520
 And that's when you see it going from a black background to a white background.

1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:38.880
 Trying to figure out what the heck is this? Well, yeah. And he wants to get as much data

1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:42.240
 as he can on it based on the different modes instead of just staring at it going. What is that

1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:50.080
 thing? So the video has been out. It actually was on YouTube for years before the government

1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:58.640
 released it. It was leaked 2007. No, I got the guy that was in my backseat sent me an email

1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:04.880
 and I had retired. So this is about, no, because I was working, I was working down in San Diego.

1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:13.920
 So this is about 2008, early 2009. He sends me a link to Strangeland.com,

1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:20.720
 which is not suitable for work. Oh, yeah, it's top notch. And he says, hey, I can remember the

1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:26.800
 email. Hey, Skip, does this look familiar? And I look at, I'm like, how the hell did that get

1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:34.320
 on Strangeland.com? So next thing you know, it ends up on YouTube, which was cool because you

1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:39.840
 can send a YouTube link to someone. You don't send Strangeland.com to someone because you don't

1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:47.440
 know what you're going to get. It's like Googling kittens. So it ends up there somehow. So it gets

1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:52.000
 on YouTube, which was cool because I would go out with my friends and we'd be drinking and they

1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.960
 go, dude, what's the coolest thing you ever saw flying? It's kind of like you were asking what

1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:58.560
 it's like. And I go, oh, dude, I chased a UFO and they're like, get out. And I'm like, no,

1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:03.360
 serious. So this is literally how it happened. So I was sitting with my friend, Matt. So Matt

1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:08.240
 and I did our, he was the guy in my right seat of the A6 when I did my very first night trap,

1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:13.280
 right? And we were friends to this day, right? Because when you do stuff like people like that,

1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:17.120
 you know, you had to have faith in him. He had to have faith in me. You know,

1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:22.880
 they become like your brother. And these are guys that literally, you know, I don't talk to

1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:28.560
 them on a regular basis like Chris who works at Apple. If Chris called me up tomorrow and said,

1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:32.320
 dude, I need help. I need this. I'd be like, all right, let's figure this out and let's do it

1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:37.280
 because they're like family. You do it. And most Navy guys, we don't, we don't send letters to

1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:41.040
 each other weekly. You know, I have friends that could, I haven't talked to in 10 years that they

1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:46.480
 showed up on my door, you know, pop a bottle of wine, grab a beer, shoot the shit, take about

1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:50.400
 first 10 minutes to catch up. And then it's, it's like old times and it's, it's amazing how fast

1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:55.760
 it's happened. So incredible. So I'm out to dinner with Matt. And I'm telling him this story and

1:36:55.760 --> 1:37:03.280
 he's like, get out of here. So he goes back and he tells our friend Paco. Paco has fightersweep.com.

1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:11.120
 It's a blog site. So Paco's obsessed. Like he is way into UFOs. So Paco calls me up. He says,

1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:14.240
 dude, I was talking to Maddie. That's what we call him. He goes, I was talking to Maddie.

1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:20.480
 He goes, dude, you got to tell me this story. So I'm like, all right, so I spend a chunk of time.

1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:26.160
 And so he calls me one day and I'm like, I get a voicemail. Hey, give me a call. So I call him up

1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:29.840
 and he answers the phone, but I can hear people in the background and I go, hey,

1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:32.480
 dude, what's going on? He goes, hang on, hang on. I got to put you on speakerphone. I go,

1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:35.280
 what are you putting me on speakerphone? He goes, you got to tell the story. I'm having a dinner party.

1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:39.440
 You got to tell the story. So he's literally having a dinner party with his cell phone in

1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:43.680
 the middle of the table as I tell a tic tac story. So he calls me up again. He says, hey,

1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:49.600
 I got this blog and he just writes about fighter stuff like he wrote about that we call him the

1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:53.920
 shit hot break. That's a guy that when you land on a carrier comes and turns and gets ready to land

1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:59.440
 really fast like breaks it off right at the back of the ship. And one of the guys when we were

1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:03.040
 junior officers on the USS Ranger, one of the apartment heads, the other squadron is a guy,

1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:07.680
 Nasty. And Nasty was notorious for coming in in a Tomcat and cranking off the shit hot break.

1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:13.280
 Right. So he literally wrote a thing about the shit hot break with Nasty and there's another guy

1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:20.560
 or MAV was our, one of our landing signals officers for the air wing. It's just, it's a good

1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:24.960
 article on how this was and how, you know, it kind of forms you in naval aviation. It's kind of

1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:28.480
 being part of the club. So he's like, I got to write about this thing. I'm like, what do you

1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:31.920
 guys, I got to write about it. I go, all right. I go, because at first I would say no. I'm like,

1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:35.920
 dude, I don't want this out. They're just. You haven't really before then talked about it much.

1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:41.040
 My wife didn't even really know the whole story. Why? Just as a comment, is it just because you

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:47.360
 caught some? No. It was just, I'll tell you what, three days we had the incident for about two days.

1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:51.920
 They played the goofy movies. There's a comic on the back of the air wing schedule that they would

1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:56.320
 put. It was like, first one was a far side and the second one was me and the guy in my back seat

1:38:56.320 --> 1:38:59.760
 and it was men in black, but it had our names, you know, protecting, protecting the Nimitz

1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:06.000
 battle group type stuff. It's just funny shit like that. So to me, it wasn't that big of a deal.

1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:09.440
 It was like, okay, that's weird. We're never going to know what it was. I want to get out

1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:13.120
 because this is important because there's all kinds of rumors. There's a group of folks that

1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:23.680
 no one ever came out in suits to talk to us. Nobody looking like me. No. Came out on a.

1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:28.640
 No. No one came out on a helicopter. No one came out on an airplane. You know, you get,

1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:33.920
 oh, I was told to turn over this classified. What's funny is all the COs and several of them are

1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:39.840
 still in the Navy. There's one that is a, I think he just finished up. He was a captain of an aircraft

1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:44.800
 carrier, you know, so he'll end up making Admiral and all that stuff. Those guys are all my friends.

1:39:44.800 --> 1:39:50.960
 I talk to them daily. Just to clarify, so just for people who don't know, there's a story

1:39:50.960 --> 1:40:00.240
 that both on the Nimitz and the Princeton folks in a helicopter landed, they showed up, they took

1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:06.400
 the data, quote, unquote, so all the sort of recordings associated with this incident,

1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:13.280
 and they took it and presumably deleted it. There's a kind of story to that. And then

1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:19.280
 from what I've seen, you said that you believe just like we were talking about offline,

1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:24.720
 the jokes spread faster than or just rumors spread faster than anything on these ships

1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:31.520
 that it might have been a joke that started and. Well, they did. So here's the joke. Yeah.

1:40:31.520 --> 1:40:38.080
 So they had come down, right? We had the tapes and they were Chad's tapes. So we use those tapes

1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:42.080
 over and over again. You know, they're consumable. But remember, I have a budget as a squadron,

1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:45.440
 so I have a budget. So I have to buy those tapes. I have to, all that stuff that we use,

1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:49.520
 I'm accountable for. And the tapes are actually classified secret because of the data that's

1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:57.200
 on them. So we had the tapes. So the intelligence guys, the intel officers came down from what's

1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:03.760
 called Civic, CVIC, which is Carrier Intel Center, came down and said, hey, we need the tapes. These

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:10.320
 guys are going to come and get them. So we're like, oh, whatever. So we hand them the tapes.

1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:16.080
 And then someone, because I have, you know, you know, people shortly after they came and got the

1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:19.600
 tapes, someone came to me and said, you know, they're, they're messing with you. They're playing a

1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:25.520
 joke. So I said, oh, let's see how well that goes because, you know, I'm a CEO and they're not.

1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:31.040
 And so I went down to Civic and it was a, I think he was a Lieutenant or Lieutenant JG. So he's

1:41:31.040 --> 1:41:36.720
 way junior to me. And I said, hey, I want my tapes back and that he looks at me and I go,

1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:40.720
 I know you guys are pulling my leg. I know you, there's no one came out and I go, and you have

1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:45.600
 about 30 seconds to get me my tapes before I start tearing this place apart. That's literally what I

1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:50.560
 told him. And I said, and if your boss has an issue, he can come and see me because it's not

1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:55.520
 going to go well. I said, because it's bullshit and I need those tapes. Then he literally walked

1:41:55.520 --> 1:41:58.560
 right over to a filing cabinet and opened it up. They weren't to say if he opened up a filing

1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:02.720
 cabinet and pulled him out and handed him to me. I said, and I basically said a few things to him,

1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:08.480
 like, don't ever fuck with me again. And I left. I had the tapes. So this, no one came out. There's

1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:14.320
 no flying going on when all this is happening. And I took the tapes back and then I copied the tapes.

1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:19.840
 So I took two brand new eight mil tapes and I copied the sections that I want. So there's a

1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:24.000
 rumor too that, oh, the original FLIR video is 10 minutes long and there's some, one of these

1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:28.080
 pediosters is saying, I saw it. That's total crap. The original video is about a minute, 30 seconds

1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:35.280
 long. What you see on the release video is the entire video. So you have mentioned, I apologize

1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:41.360
 if I say stupid things, please correct me, but you have mentioned that, like on Rogan, I think,

1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:46.960
 that you watched it on, you know, on a bigger screen. It felt like it was higher definition.

1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:55.280
 So let me ask the question, is there a higher definition version do you think of the FLIR

1:42:55.280 --> 1:43:00.400
 video that would give us more pixels and more information, presumably because of the

1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:05.680
 I would doubt it because I don't know where the stuff that the government released. I don't

1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:09.120
 know where they got. Okay. So the stuff that was on Strangeland and YouTube, you know, someone

1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:13.760
 pulled off of a secret. It looks like a rack. You know, there's tape machines in there and it gets

1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:16.800
 converted to digital and stored on a hard drive and they pulled it off that hard drive and they

1:43:16.800 --> 1:43:23.840
 put it on YouTube. No, it's just like, you know, anytime even a digital media, the more you copy

1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:28.080
 digital media, there's some quality that gets it degrades. So this, you don't know how many times

1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:31.440
 this has been copied. So we were looking at the videos I've seen are right off the original.

1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:35.120
 They're high eight tapes. It's basically pulled off the back of the display. So it's not filmed

1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:39.280
 with cameras. It's literally a digital feed that's pulled off the back and put onto a high eight tape.

1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:43.520
 That's how the recorders work. Now it's actually digital to digital. It's not even on tapes anymore.

1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:46.880
 They said it's a digital recording system, but we were still in that process of slowing up because

1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:51.840
 originally we had little cameras here that shine. So if the light hit, it would wash out the displays.

1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:56.800
 So this is, it's a pretty good feed. When you put it on, so we're, instead of looking at it

1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:01.760
 on your tiny little computer monitor or whatever, I'm looking at it on a like a 19 inch because

1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:05.440
 it was still normal TVs back there. We had just put flat screens in the ready room that I had bought

1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:13.680
 so we could watch movies. So because a nice huge 19 inch screen is maybe 20. It was nice.

1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:20.720
 Wow, that's huge. Gigantic. I can get for like 50 bucks and get like 60 inches.

1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:27.600
 This is 2005. So you look at this big thing and you could see, so when you get to the TV mode,

1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:30.400
 when I say there's little things coming out of the bottom of it, you could see those.

1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:33.520
 It was very clear. But in terms of the actual

1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:40.400
 visual on the tic tac, was it, did you get much more information from the higher, from the clear

1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:44.480
 little things out of the bottom? We didn't see the bottom of information. So when you see it,

1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:48.320
 because he's coming almost co altitude with it, you can see the bottom of it. It looks like little,

1:44:48.320 --> 1:44:51.280
 you know, like if you look at a session, there's little antennas hanging out of the bottom,

1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:54.480
 kind of like that. There's two little things out of the bottom. There's nothing on the top.

1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:59.440
 There was no plume, no IR, no, no visible propulsions, even heat signature,

1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:03.440
 you know, it's all that stuff. And then the other thing that people didn't see is they didn't see

1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:09.440
 the radar display, which that really raises a classification love, especially to see what

1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:14.240
 the radar does when it's being jammed. You know, and I matter of fact, when they did the unofficial

1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:21.680
 official investigation in about 2000, and let me think about 2009, I had gotten a call on

1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:28.480
 my cell phone from a guy who government employee and said, Hey, he told me who he was, he's still

1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:34.640
 in the government. I'm friends with him. And he said, Hey, we're going to investigate your tic

1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:41.040
 tac thing. This is literally five years later. Yeah, five years later. And I said, Okay, whatever.

1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:44.240
 And he did a pretty good job. I caught the unofficial official report because

1:45:46.560 --> 1:45:51.760
 it was really never official. It wasn't. But I'll give you the history of why I say that and why

1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:57.120
 it never came out in FOIA requests. So he does the report, he sent me the report. And all he said

1:45:57.120 --> 1:46:01.760
 is, Hey, I'm going to send you this report, please don't distribute this report. I said, Okay,

1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:06.880
 the report is now out because Harry Reid got it to George Knapp. And they were good enough to

1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:11.200
 redact it. There's a few versions of it unredacted. And I'm very protective of the other people that

1:46:11.200 --> 1:46:16.560
 were involved in this. So Jim has talked, but he's off the grid. He doesn't talk to anyone now.

1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:22.000
 The pilot of his airplane, she has come out on unidentified, but they don't release her name,

1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:25.360
 although people are starting to do it. And she's had weird shit happen around her house. She's got

1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:31.120
 kids. You know, so I'm very protective of her. And I've told people like Jeremy and George, if I

1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:34.800
 know that the names ever came from you, I will never talk to you again about this. And Jeremy's

1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:39.360
 been really good about it. And so is George. And then, but George, George knew the names were

1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:45.680
 because he had, he got the report from Senator Reid. And then the other crew. So the pilot of

1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:52.960
 the airplane that took the video that Chad was in, if you talk to that individual, they really

1:46:52.960 --> 1:46:56.160
 don't have the recollection, they were just out flying that day. And it wasn't a big deal.

1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:01.680
 So it's, it's you, you need to protect, because not everyone wants people knocking,

1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:05.680
 I don't want people knocking on my door. And, you know, and there's rumors all you talk to

1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:10.720
 everyone. I think you're about the 23rd person that I've talked to total. And that includes,

1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:15.440
 you know, the newspapers and stuff. And I've been selective because there's so much. I mean, if,

1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:20.960
 if I turned down like, I turned down Russian TV, I can give you her name when we're done here.

1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:24.480
 But she, she called, she not only called me, she called my wife, she called my daughter,

1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:28.960
 she called my son and she called my son in law because they're persistent. So I'm, I'm pretty

1:47:28.960 --> 1:47:32.960
 protect, I'm very particular. I mean, the reason I'm talking to you is because I knew we would

1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:36.000
 have a conversation that wasn't based just on the tic tac and the incident, but we could actually

1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:40.960
 talk about some of the science and some of the theoretical to get into, to get more people

1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:47.680
 involved to go, because I think there's, you know, and when you talk to, you know, Lou Elizondo or

1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:53.280
 Chris Mellon, you know, the group at TTSA, you know, the, that whole thing was, that's to the

1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:59.760
 stars Academy. That's the Tom DeLong group that got started. So, and you go, well, you know,

1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:04.320
 because I think Tom has caught a lot of crap for this, but he's actually, when you talk to him,

1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:08.720
 he's, he's, he's very smart. And I ask him, how'd you get into this? And he goes, oh,

1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:12.880
 when I was traveling around with Blink 182, he goes, you read a lot of books when you're laying

1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:18.400
 in a van as you're driving to your next gig before you make it big. And he goes, and he read, he

1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:21.280
 was reading books and he read one of them on UFOs. I'm trying to think the title, that's one of the

1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:27.040
 big ones that's out there, real popular. And so he started just, he started asking more and through

1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:33.120
 his fame with Blink 182 in the band, he got more and more connected. You know, if you talk to Chris

1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:38.400
 Mellon, who is an Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, and he's part of the Mellon, you

1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:45.120
 know, dynasty, you know, from Carnegie Mellon type, very, very smart. He knows, he, he, he definitely

1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:50.320
 knows how the government works because he worked there. And so when I went down to DC to talk to

1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:56.960
 people, he's one of the first people I'll go to. When I did Tucker Carlson about a month ago,

1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:03.600
 a month and a half ago, I asked, he texted me. I texted him, Tom, Lou, to go, hey,

1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:07.120
 because they were like, you got to do it. Because I turned, I had turned Tucker down a

1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:13.840
 couple of times before and his, his producer had called me and I'm like, all right, I'll do it.

1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:16.000
 Because those guys are like, you got to, you got to do this for us.

1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:23.040
 So from my perspective, just to give you some context. So to me, there seems to be some stigma.

1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:26.880
 So I come from the scientific community and I really appreciate you talking to me today.

1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:35.200
 And I think the people who listen to this include, you know, fellow faculty at MIT and major

1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:41.440
 universities. And it feels like there's some stigma to the subject from, from the scientific

1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:46.640
 community. A lot of people, especially when they hear your story are like, wow, this is really

1:49:46.640 --> 1:49:54.400
 interesting. But you don't even know, one, you're afraid to talk about it. And two, you don't know

1:49:54.400 --> 1:50:01.760
 what the next steps are. Like how can we seriously try to think about what you saw, how to think about

1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:10.960
 how we further look for things like it, how we develop systems and plans for how in the future

1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:19.520
 we can immediately collect a lot more data and try to react properly, you know, try to communicate,

1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:27.040
 try to interpret this in the best way possible from a scientific perspective. And I just would

1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:34.800
 love to remove stigma from this subject. Well, I think that's the first step. We have done in

1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:40.960
 this country an absolutely terrible job with these things. So you go, and I joke, you know, go back

1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:46.000
 to Roswell. So the first reports that came out of Roswell was we have this crash flying saucer.

1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:50.480
 That's literally what came out. And then magically the next day, it's a weather balloon and they're

1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:54.480
 showing your pieces of mylar. And you go, well, that doesn't look like what they showed us yesterday.

1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:58.240
 Then you get into Project Blue Book, you know, so there's that whole series about Project Blue

1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:01.920
 Book. But the bottom line of Project Blue Book is it really did two things. It investigated

1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:07.120
 sightings and it did everything it could to debunk and disprove to the point where it actually went

1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:13.600
 to discredit, you know, to make you look. So there's always been this, this, I don't know if you'd

1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:17.760
 call it an aura around it or a mystique about UFOs that if you're talking about them, they're nuts.

1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:24.400
 With ours, because I'm not a UFO guy. I'm not a junkie. If you ask me, do I believe

1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:30.640
 that there's life outside of Earth, I would say you probably have a better chance of winning

1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:36.160
 the Mega Ball Lottery than we're the only planet that has life on it in the universe.

1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:41.120
 It's just the odds are against it. If you're, if you do just do the math, you have to accept,

1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:45.360
 because if there only has to be one other planet that has life on it,

1:51:45.360 --> 1:51:50.480
 and then I win and you lose. And the more and more science has shown that there's habitable

1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:55.440
 planets out there, that yeah, everything we've learned so far, and we know very little, but

1:51:55.440 --> 1:52:02.480
 everything we've learned so far about the planets out there, exoplanets, Earth like planets,

1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:07.840
 it seems that it's very likely that there's life out there. Intelligent life is another topic,

1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:13.600
 but life. Well, we, we as humans, you know, and even more as Americans, we have this hubris about

1:52:13.600 --> 1:52:20.560
 us that says, we are it. And you go, not so much. Maybe we're not so intelligent.

1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:26.080
 Because we are, it's just how we learn. So, you know, our main mode of transportation and what

1:52:26.080 --> 1:52:30.240
 people figured out, you know, years ago was the internal combustion engine, which led us to jet

1:52:30.240 --> 1:52:36.000
 engines and solid rocket fuel. What if you're in another planet where you didn't, you figured out

1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:41.920
 the ability to create a gravity field or you used, you know, because electromagnetics are

1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:45.520
 becoming bigger and bigger and bigger, you know, catapults on ships were steam powered,

1:52:45.520 --> 1:52:49.920
 and the new Gerald Ford is electromagnetic. Roller coaster used to use a chain to get you

1:52:49.920 --> 1:52:53.840
 the top of the hill. Now you, they shoot you with electromagnetics and you're going. So,

1:52:53.840 --> 1:52:58.160
 there's a whole new realm of propulsion that, you know, sometimes it's our ability to develop

1:52:58.160 --> 1:53:03.120
 the technology to support theory. You know, we are just now proving, you know, recently

1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:07.760
 theories that Einstein had where people actually joked about them. And now we actually have the

1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:12.800
 technology to prove that gravity can bend light. You know, we have proven that. So, you look at

1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:16.560
 that way and you go, well, does that mean that, you know, 70 years ago, Einstein was wrong or

1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:20.880
 eight years ago, Einstein was wrong? Or do you go, we just didn't have the ability to look that deep

1:53:20.880 --> 1:53:24.800
 into space to actually find something that we could, to actually measure and, you know, and

1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:28.400
 I've seen this. And that's just a hundred years and the kind of things that can happen in a few

1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:32.640
 centuries. Look at what we've done in the last 20 years. Yeah, it's crazy. Let me direct, because

1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:36.080
 it's such an interesting topic from a career perspective, from a science perspective.

1:53:38.160 --> 1:53:44.560
 You're, I mean, you've spoke, you've been brave in, you know, telling your story, not some dramatic

1:53:44.560 --> 1:53:51.840
 thing, but just telling the things you've seen. Did it encounter, did it impact your career?

1:53:52.880 --> 1:53:58.800
 Is that why more people haven't come out? Like you've mentioned, Roswell, like, how,

1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:06.320
 what advice do you give to people, to the community, to me as a scientist, for ways to go

1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:14.000
 forward about this topic and still have a, you know, not to being put in a bin in society,

1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:18.960
 that he's a loon or she's a loon or that person? Mine is to get away from the little green men,

1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:25.760
 divorce the two little green men. And, you know, I've talked to Lou Elizondo about this,

1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:28.960
 you know, and the group that they're working with, which is incredible. I mean, they've got

1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:33.680
 Steve Justice, who used to run Skunk Works, where they built, you know, projects.

1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:36.400
 Now, Lou Elizondo, which you mentioned, was a program director.

1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:41.840
 He ran the ATIP program at the Pentagon. And ATIP was a program that was tasked with investigating

1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:48.720
 any kind of UFOs, UAPs. So what's funny is the unofficial official report that I joke about,

1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:52.800
 the guy who wrote the unofficial official report was actually an original member of ATIP.

1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:58.160
 And the original stuff that ATIP did was FOIA exempt. And people go, how do you know that?

1:54:58.160 --> 1:55:01.040
 I go, because I stood there with the memo in my hand that said these are,

1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:07.280
 it literally, I watched the DOD memo that said it and it was signed. So he was one. So that's

1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:10.720
 why the, that's why I caught the unofficial official report. It was never, it was never

1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:14.240
 releasable. Cause people go, well, I put in a FOIA request and I didn't get that. I go,

1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:17.760
 well, just cause you put in a FOIA request and get it. I go, because how much, how much time

1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:20.800
 do you think that guy's going to spend to get you the information that you requested if you can't

1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:26.160
 find it? I actually got called by the Navy. I had a commander and a Navy call me about,

1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:31.360
 right before the article came out in the New York Times. It was, this was starting to come back.

1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:34.880
 And she had called me cause there's been, there was a FOIA request for stuff about the Nimitz

1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:39.280
 incident. And I said, do you know of anything she called me? She goes, do you know of anything

1:55:39.280 --> 1:55:43.760
 else besides the, the situation reports that come off the ship? And you know, and you got to

1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:47.760
 remember when the situation report comes off the ship, that's like third hand. So we tell someone,

1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:52.480
 they tell someone, that person has to write it up. So there's all kinds of inaccuracies in it.

1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:56.720
 But then there's the unofficial official report that's actually pretty well written. There's

1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:01.040
 some errors in it, but it was, you know, I didn't help write it. I just did it. And he did a really

1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:08.000
 good job of researching it and figuring out who's who in the zoo and the players. So she called me

1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:11.040
 and said, is there anything out there? And I said, officially out there, she said, yes,

1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:15.120
 I said, I don't know of anything. I knew of the unofficial official report, which is that one.

1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:18.320
 But I'm not, you know, if you don't know about it, I'm not going to tell you because that's not

1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:25.120
 my job. And nor did I care. I mean, did in that whole situation, you mentioned Lou, I mean,

1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:30.720
 did you think about your impact to your career? Like just to get back to the question, do you

1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:38.320
 think others, other pilots, other thing, other people like in the Roosevelt are thinking about

1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:42.160
 this kind of thing? Why aren't they talking about this? Why are people afraid to talk about this?

1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:47.600
 Well, honestly, the military and the press, there's a distrust. I'll just tell you that right now.

1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:52.800
 We typically don't like talking to the press because if I talk to you, you know, especially

1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:57.520
 when I do even the TV shows, you know, because I've been on a couple of shows, when you look at it,

1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:02.000
 you know, they come to my house and they film me for two hours. And then what you see on the screen

1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:06.320
 is five minutes. Well, and the, and the other thing with the press, let me give you my perspective

1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:14.560
 from autonomous vehicles is the clipping happens. Yes. But also the incompetence. Let me just call

1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:25.120
 out journals. They're not thinking. I mean, so here's the thing. I've, I have a PhD and I've taken

1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:32.880
 painfully too many classes from like physics, math, and I also have a deep curiosity about the world.

1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:37.280
 I read a lot. That seems to be missing with journalism. So you're talking to a person who

1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:42.640
 is not going to push the story forward in an interesting way, not the story, but the actual

1:57:42.640 --> 1:57:49.520
 investigation of perhaps one of the most amazing things that humans have witnessed in history.

1:57:49.520 --> 1:57:55.440
 Like you, it might have been nothing. Who knows what you witnessed might have been from a sort of

1:57:55.440 --> 1:58:00.800
 debunking perspective, might have been some kind of trick of mind. If you and others have hallucinated

1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:10.640
 something, it could be some simple explanation, but possibly it was something not of this world.

1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:16.560
 And to not do justice to this story from a scientific perspective,

1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:23.760
 it seems at best negligence. And so yeah, that's true for journalists. That's true for other

1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:29.600
 scientists. It's just a human nature. Yeah. If we, if we can't, if we see something that we can't

1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:35.920
 explain, then sometimes if you just, eh, maybe it's just me and you let it go away and you

1:58:35.920 --> 1:58:40.240
 don't think about it, you know, maybe it'll just, you know, it's, it's, you ignore it.

1:58:41.600 --> 1:58:44.880
 The other side is the inquisitive mind that says, well, what was that? And I want to,

1:58:44.880 --> 1:58:50.160
 I want to dig more into it. You know, and if you, you, you look at it or you're going against the

1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:55.920
 norm, um, you can get ostracized, you know, and if you look at, you know, Einstein's the perfect

1:58:55.920 --> 1:59:00.000
 example. I mean, when he started coming up with some of his theories, some of the top physicists

1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:05.040
 in the world were like, dude, you're, you're a nut job. And he's, he's literally proving them,

1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:10.400
 but he didn't have, you know, he proved them in theory, but he didn't have the means to actually

1:59:10.400 --> 1:59:16.160
 do the experiment to prove his theory. There's a great book that I recommend people read called

1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:23.280
 Proving Einstein Right by Jim Gates that, uh, talks about like the hard work that people try to do

1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:30.560
 years after, uh, to try to experimentally validate the predictions that Einstein made with, uh,

1:59:30.560 --> 1:59:36.000
 with his theories. It's fascinating. But yes, at the time it's kind of crazy. What are you saying?

1:59:36.720 --> 1:59:40.000
 Yeah. If you look at it back at the time, don't we, we look at it now and go, well,

1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:44.560
 the guy was a walking genius and he was, but if you go back in time when he was doing it,

1:59:44.560 --> 1:59:49.360
 it was like, what are you talking about? You know, and, but one of the challenges is

1:59:50.320 --> 1:59:56.080
 your eye witness, one of the challenges is you're essentially an eye witness account.

1:59:56.080 --> 2:00:02.800
 Like we don't have good data. We have very limited data of, um, of the incident that you've

2:00:02.800 --> 2:00:08.880
 experienced. So let me kind of dig in. Let me just ask some questions of, um, maybe to see if

2:00:08.880 --> 2:00:15.200
 there's just to paint more and more of the picture. One, you kind of mentioned the tic tac shape.

2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:21.520
 Let's break apart two situations. One is the video. Let's look at the actual eye account,

2:00:21.520 --> 2:00:26.880
 the, the eye witness account that you saw with your own eyes. What's the, what can you say about

2:00:26.880 --> 2:00:31.600
 the shape of the thing? Is there interesting aspects outside of the tic tac? Like, is there any

2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:41.920
 appendages? Is there, um, some texture to it that no smooth white tic tac, you know, we don't,

2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:50.080
 you don't see, there's no, no wings, no visible propulsion, no windows, no probes that we could

2:00:50.080 --> 2:00:53.920
 see. We don't notice, like I said, we don't see the little things on the bottom of it until we

2:00:53.920 --> 2:01:00.160
 see the video in the TV mode when it zoomed in right before it's shortly, you kind of seem to

2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:05.600
 zoom in. You don't see it typically on the YouTube stuff that's out there. Um, but remember,

2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:10.080
 we're looking at the original tape. So there's not, there's basically no degradation.

2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:12.400
 But when you saw with your eyes, there's no kind of appendages.

2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:13.360
 No, none.

2:01:13.360 --> 2:01:18.480
 What about like somebody asked, a lot of people asked you questions. So, uh, I appreciate you

2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:23.840
 spending your time here. Let me ask some of them. Uh, did you, I mean, you chased it. So,

2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:30.560
 when you flew close to it, relatively speaking, was there, did you feel any wake, like any,

2:01:31.360 --> 2:01:36.160
 did you feel it in any way in terms of your interaction, like aerodynamically?

2:01:36.160 --> 2:01:43.840
 No, nothing, nothing. So, uh, another aspect of it, there's an interesting thing you've developed

2:01:43.840 --> 2:01:53.520
 to feel for, for objects in the air. Did you feel like it was surprised by your arrival or did it,

2:01:54.400 --> 2:01:59.040
 let me ask a few questions around it. So did you, did it feel like the thing was surprised?

2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:06.080
 Did it feel like it wanted to be seen almost to show off its capability?

2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:14.960
 Did, uh, and did, what did it feel like relative to if you were doing a, um, uh, an air fight

2:02:14.960 --> 2:02:19.440
 against, uh, sort of like a, I don't know, a foreign jet?

2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:25.840
 So one, I think it, I think it knew we were there when we showed up. It's just, it's me.

2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:30.160
 It's kind of like an animal. If you've ever been around deer in a field, you know, the deer will

2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:33.680
 look up and if it sees you and you're on the other side of the field, it'll actually go,

2:02:33.680 --> 2:02:36.800
 no threat and it'll start eating, you know, they don't put their tail up. As you move closer to

2:02:36.800 --> 2:02:41.120
 the deer, then it goes, oh, it's there and I'm going to react or I'm going to move. So as we

2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:47.520
 were up high and it's down doing whatever it was doing, um, you know, which I don't know,

2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:50.160
 someone asked, what do you think? I don't know, maybe it was communicating with something. I

2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:54.160
 joked on good morning America. Maybe it's like talking to the whales, kind of like Star Trek,

2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:59.040
 you know, and actually use that clip. It was kind of funny, but yeah, we're a little human

2:02:59.040 --> 2:03:04.240
 centric. We think like it would, it'd show up to talk to us, but maybe he's talking to the dolphins.

2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:07.760
 Yeah, whatever, you know, because it was hanging around that whitewater and I don't know if it

2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:10.560
 was, or something there was a seamount. We just didn't find it again. I don't know.

2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:16.320
 But once we started to descend and it actually reoriented its, its longitudinal axis and it

2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:19.520
 started mirroring us coming up and it was obviously where we were there and it was really

2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:24.240
 coming up just, you know, you figure I'm at 20 and it's coming up and it ends up getting up to 12,

2:03:24.240 --> 2:03:29.520
 12, where I cut across the circle. I think it was very aware that we were there because it

2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:36.400
 interacted. We call it a two circle fight when you're fighting another airplane. But, you know,

2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:42.080
 were we afraid? I don't think so. I mean, and to me, it was more curious.

2:03:42.640 --> 2:03:46.400
 You know, the curiosity overcomes any fear that you would have. And I always felt, to be honest,

2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:52.560
 if I was inside the airplane, especially as long as much time as I'd spent inside the airplane,

2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:59.440
 flying and doing stuff, I felt totally, it was like a safe zone. I mean, I felt totally comfortable

2:03:59.440 --> 2:04:03.200
 inside the airplane as most, you can't, if you're in the airplane and you feel scared,

2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:07.280
 it's not the job for you. You have to feel that because the airplane is part of you now.

2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:11.840
 You know, I am inside. I have the stick. I have the throttles. I've got my wisdom in the back

2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:18.800
 seat. He's running all the displays. We are a team. We're in the state of the art airplane,

2:04:18.800 --> 2:04:23.840
 you know, brand new. You feel pretty good. And then you get something that, you know,

2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:28.480
 can climb from the surface up and then accelerate like it did, like it was like no big deal.

2:04:28.480 --> 2:04:32.080
 You know, for an airplane, if you just put me from a standstill, let's just say slow flight,

2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:37.600
 just get me at 100 knots above the water. And for me to, you can't just start to climb. I'd

2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:40.880
 have to lower the nose. I'd have to accelerate. And then I'd have to start coming up and

2:04:42.640 --> 2:04:45.200
 this thing just like, just did it like it was like no big deal.

2:04:45.200 --> 2:04:52.000
 Yeah. You mentioned that like kind of your reaction to it was it like it's something

2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:57.680
 that you would love to fly almost. So this object, just the curiosity you experience is like,

2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:04.800
 like what it almost like, what the heck is that piece of technology and I want to fly it?

2:05:04.800 --> 2:05:11.520
 Like what made you feel like it's something that you could fly? Do you think it's something

2:05:11.520 --> 2:05:17.520
 that a human could fly? Like in terms of interpreting what you saw as a piece of technology,

2:05:17.520 --> 2:05:25.520
 because another perspective on it is it was not that the thing under the water was the key thing.

2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:31.760
 And what you were seeing is some kind of projection or something that like,

2:05:31.760 --> 2:05:33.680
 I don't think it was a projection. I think it was a real object.

2:05:33.680 --> 2:05:37.440
 It was an physical hard object that you could be fly.

2:05:37.440 --> 2:05:42.640
 Oh yeah. Yeah. I think all four of us will say the same thing. This was not because you go,

2:05:43.200 --> 2:05:48.480
 okay, let's just go on. It's a light projection. Well, if we were both sitting next to each

2:05:48.480 --> 2:05:52.160
 other, we were just looking at it from the exact same angle and all that. And I go, okay,

2:05:52.160 --> 2:05:56.720
 there's the in theory you could have that. But with an 8,000 foot altitude difference flying,

2:05:56.720 --> 2:06:00.480
 you know, and there, you know, she's probably not directly above me. She's kind of hanging out,

2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:04.800
 watching this whole thing happen. You know, you're getting two different perspectives from two

2:06:04.800 --> 2:06:09.600
 different altitudes over a clear blue. You know, if you've ever been at sea, and I don't mean like

2:06:09.600 --> 2:06:13.360
 coast, I mean, like when you get out at sea, the ocean is the bluest. It's incredible.

2:06:15.280 --> 2:06:20.560
 You know, you got a bright white object over a deep blue ocean. You got pretty high contrast.

2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:28.080
 And for this thing just to disappear, it's wasn't I'm telling you, I would, I mean, I know we

2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:34.640
 we all have the same recollection of what happened. You know, there's some details because it's so

2:06:34.640 --> 2:06:38.640
 long ago. But for the most part, we know what we saw. And we all came back and looked at each

2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:43.680
 other like, what the hell was that? What if I mean, do you think about the thing under the water?

2:06:43.680 --> 2:06:48.320
 That's not often talked about. If there's something under the water, couldn't have been something

2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:55.120
 gigantic? It could be what like, do you ever see this big ship? That's why as a person,

2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:59.120
 so I love like swimming out into the ocean by miles and Olympic swimmers, like,

2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:04.080
 I love that feeling, but I'm also terrified when I swim because the abyss, it could anything could

2:07:04.080 --> 2:07:11.200
 be under there. I like, there's not enough focus on that, perhaps because there's no visibility.

2:07:11.200 --> 2:07:15.920
 But is it, is there anything interesting to say about the possibility that was anything

2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:19.920
 underneath there? Could be. I mean, think about it, if you're going to hide on this planet,

2:07:19.920 --> 2:07:26.480
 where's, what's the least explored spot on the planet? Two thirds of it's the ocean.

2:07:29.680 --> 2:07:35.520
 There's literally, I mean, come on, the Malaysia airplane, the 777, it was the 777 that crashed,

2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:38.720
 you know, they turned, they didn't go where they're supposed to and they just disappeared and

2:07:38.720 --> 2:07:42.720
 they've been searching for it and they found pieces of it. But you would think there's large

2:07:42.720 --> 2:07:46.800
 objects that, you know, when that thing hit the water, depending on how it broke up, there's big

2:07:46.800 --> 2:07:50.000
 pieces that would be, you'd find something, they haven't found anything except what floated.

2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:54.480
 So to hide something underwater, I think would be easy.

2:07:54.480 --> 2:07:59.760
 So, okay, let's go a little bit in speculation land, but it's the best, it's the best we can do,

2:07:59.760 --> 2:08:06.800
 which is the basic question of what do you think was it? So if you had to put money on it,

2:08:07.680 --> 2:08:15.200
 is it like advanced human creative technology? Is it alien technology? Is it an unknown physical

2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:19.840
 phenomena? You know, like ball lightning, for example, there's a lot of fascinating things

2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:26.400
 we probably just don't really understand. Is it, like I said, some perception cognition that led

2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:31.440
 you some kind of hallucination that made you to misinterpret the things you were seeing?

2:08:31.440 --> 2:08:35.040
 Let me put those things on the table. Or is it misinterpretation of some

2:08:35.840 --> 2:08:40.800
 known physical phenomena like an ice cloud or something like that? What do you think it was?

2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:44.160
 No, it's definitely, I don't think it's an ice cloud because ice clouds don't fly around.

2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:45.040
 Yep.

2:08:45.040 --> 2:08:51.120
 And react to you. Do I think it was a light? I'd say no, because of the aspects and what we looked

2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:54.480
 and watched it do. I'd say no. What do you mean by light?

2:08:54.480 --> 2:08:59.760
 Like a light ball, you know, some type of perception, you know, there's their experience,

2:08:59.760 --> 2:09:03.760
 like plasma, you can do plasma and you can go, I can see it, but it's really not,

2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:09.440
 you know, it's plasma. I don't think so. You would see distortions, I think, as it moved.

2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:14.640
 Maybe not. I mean, I'm not a theoretical physicist and some, you know, I'm not an MIT.

2:09:16.160 --> 2:09:21.920
 I would say, no, I mean, it looked from all my experience and I had quite a bit of it when

2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:28.400
 this happened. No, I think it was a hard object. It was aware that we were there.

2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:33.440
 It reacted exactly like if I was another airplane and I had to come up and do something exactly

2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:38.400
 what I would do. You know, it mirrored me. It wasn't aggressive. You know, there's taco.

2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:43.360
 It flopped behind us. It was never offensive on us. It never did that. It just mirrored us.

2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:47.360
 So as we're coming out, it's just like, you know, you're kind of, you know,

2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:51.120
 you said you do martial arts, you know, or wrestling, you know, you see people out on the,

2:09:52.480 --> 2:09:55.440
 when they get into the ring, especially with collegiate wrestling, because my roommate in

2:09:55.440 --> 2:10:00.320
 college was a collegiate wrestler. So I de facto became a wrestler because he beat me up every

2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:06.000
 night and we joke. I talked to him literally probably three, four times a week. But, you know,

2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:09.040
 you see wrestlers when they get out, they kind of, you're kind of feeling each other as you walk

2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:12.960
 on boxers do the same thing. It was doing that same thing. It's like, what's going on as it comes

2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:16.800
 around, as it comes around. And then it was like, Hey, we're going to get here. And when I got too

2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:22.000
 close to it, you know, it decided I'm out of here. And then it did something that we've never seen.

2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:25.120
 The other question is, what if I didn't cut across the circle? What if I just kept going

2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:29.120
 around a circle? We just keep going. I could have just watched it. I mean, my one regret out of the

2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:33.600
 whole thing is we have a camera in our helmet and the joint helmet. There's a little camera,

2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:37.280
 but we never use it because it's nauseating to watch because you've ever put a GoPro on someone's

2:10:37.280 --> 2:10:41.200
 head where they're looking around like this all the time, it'll, it'll nauseate you. So we never

2:10:41.200 --> 2:10:44.960
 turn that on and all, you know, it's the one thing I didn't do is reach down and hit the switch.

2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:48.800
 You know, and then we didn't go back and because our tapes didn't have anything because we didn't

2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:54.800
 get it on radar because I tried to lock it up because I can move the radar with my head, but I

2:10:54.800 --> 2:11:01.920
 couldn't, it wouldn't lock the radar would lock and so. So then the question is, and this is unanswerable,

2:11:01.920 --> 2:11:08.320
 but let's try to get some hints at it. Do you think it's human, like advanced human created

2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:17.200
 technology that's simply top secret that we're just not aware of? Or is it not something not of this

2:11:17.200 --> 2:11:26.320
 world? So you, if you to ask me in 2004, I just said, I don't know. If you ask me now, so we're

2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:35.040
 coming up on 16 years ago for a technology like that, you know, and let's assume that it didn't

2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:41.760
 have a conventional propulsion system in it because I don't think it did. I would like to think that

2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:45.600
 if we had a technology that would advance mankind leaps and bounds from what we normally do,

2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:51.440
 then it would start coming out. But to hide something like that for 16 years, you know, and I

2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:55.440
 understand, you know, and I don't speak for the United States government and I never will speak

2:11:55.440 --> 2:11:58.640
 for the United States government, but I understand how some of that stuff works for classification

2:11:58.640 --> 2:12:03.600
 levels and why we classify stuff. You know, is it detrimental to national defense? But there's a

2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:07.840
 point where you have to look and go, if we had a technology like this that could literally change the

2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:15.680
 way mankind travels, how we get things into space, our ability to do things, you know, you talk about,

2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:19.200
 you know, are we going to go to Mars? Well, if you have something that has the ability to go,

2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:22.640
 because remember, these things were coming down when the cruise retracted from above 80,000 feet,

2:12:22.640 --> 2:12:26.640
 which is space, and they would come down and they would come straight down, they'd hang out at like

2:12:26.640 --> 2:12:30.560
 20,000 feet, and then three or four hours later, they'd go back up. We don't have anything that

2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:36.000
 can come down, hang out in once, you know, and I'm talking, hold out in a spot. Well, we all know

2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:39.520
 there's winds, they're not drifting like a balloon, they're just sitting there. And then they would

2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:44.800
 go back up and they tracked up to the, when I talked to the controller, he's like, we've seen up to 10

2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:49.520
 of these things. There's other guys and it was raining and all this other, let's just say they

2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:56.800
 tracked a groups of these things coming down, hanging out and going up. So it's not just propulsion

2:12:56.800 --> 2:13:02.240
 and the way it moves, it's also fuel. It's everything. So the whole, the whole of it indicates

2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:10.560
 of a kind of technology that's highly advanced, but you don't think in your sense that you actually

2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:17.520
 don't know, but you know more than a lot of people in your sense, the top secret military

2:13:17.520 --> 2:13:20.720
 technology, if we think about Skunk Works, if we think about like that,

2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:24.320
 cannot be more than 15 years ahead.

2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:31.360
 I would say for a leap like that, and a perfect example in modern times is the 117,

2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:35.680
 because now a lot of the data on the 117 is out, like it was developed at this time.

2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:39.760
 It flew for this long before it was actually acknowledged by the United States government.

2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:40.560
 What's the 117?

2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:44.400
 That's the stealth fighter, the original stealth fighter, not the B2, but the stealth fighter.

2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:49.680
 So if you look at that, you know, yeah, you can, I think you can hide things for a while,

2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:57.120
 but I think a technology, a leap, I mean, this is not a, hey, we developed this and we're kind

2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:03.120
 of pushing the edge of technology. This is a giant leap in technology. And the other one is,

2:14:03.120 --> 2:14:08.320
 do we have the basis to do that? Because usually when you have a technology like that,

2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:14.240
 universities, especially the one you're working at, MIT, a lot of the leading edge stuff is

2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:18.160
 coming out of the top tier universities. You know, so you've got MIT, you've got Caltech,

2:14:18.160 --> 2:14:23.440
 you've got Stanford, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, I'm just naming schools,

2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:29.200
 Naval Postgraduate School is another one. There's usually indicators, there's papers of, hey,

2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:34.880
 this is where we're going. I don't think there's a whole bunch of papers on developing a gravity

2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:40.480
 based propulsion system that literally I've got an object because how do you, how much power would it

2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:46.320
 cost to create a gravity field of your own that could actually be strong enough to counter

2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:51.680
 the giant orb that we live on? So by the way, you mentioned gravity based. That's kind of like the

2:14:51.680 --> 2:15:00.240
 hypothesizing that people do in terms of propulsion, like what kind of propulsion would have to be

2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:04.960
 involved in order to result in that kind of movement. To me, all the gravity discussions just

2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:12.480
 seems insane from a physics perspective. But of course, it would seem insane until it's not.

2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:15.360
 But because remember, we only know what we know.

2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:21.280
 Yeah. And which is very little. And as someone has to think out of the box to go,

2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:29.680
 is this possible at all? Yeah. Well, okay, so this, so you're saying that if you had to bet money,

2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:36.800
 all your money, it will be something that's alien technology. So it's not human created

2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:40.560
 technology. Well, I don't like to get into little green men, but I would say that I don't,

2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:42.560
 I don't think we've developed it. I don't have to be little green men, right?

2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:46.240
 I don't think we've developed it. I just, you know, because the other one, someone asked me,

2:15:46.240 --> 2:15:49.600
 they said, what if there wasn't, maybe it was just a drone, maybe it was a UAV

2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:55.520
 that got sent here from someplace else. I mean, we've got stuff out there flying around.

2:15:55.520 --> 2:16:02.080
 So I don't, I don't know. I mean, I'd like to sit around and talk to some of the

2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:05.520
 giant brains that think this stuff up. I was supposed to be on a podcast with one of them.

2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:13.840
 Which topic? Which, you mean the drones for? Just space travel, technology,

2:16:13.840 --> 2:16:16.640
 because if you look at where we're going, you know, because everyone talks about Mars.

2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:20.560
 Are you okay? And, you know, we're, hey, are we going to be able to colonize, you know,

2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:23.200
 and I know Elon is big into that. Yeah, what do you think about,

2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:28.880
 what do you think about Elon, SpaceX, NASA? We put humans back up, back up there.

2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:35.440
 My theory, so it's funny because I know one of the guys that was, he was one of the original

2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:41.440
 employees at SpaceX. He's a friend of mine and I won't say his name, but he knows Elon. He knows

2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:46.160
 Elon and he actually worked on the entire Falcon 1 project. He's one of the lead guys on that.

2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:49.600
 So he's got some great, as a matter of fact, there's a movie, there's a book coming out

2:16:49.600 --> 2:16:53.360
 that comes out in about a year on this, the original, the first years of space, first six

2:16:53.360 --> 2:16:56.800
 years of SpaceX, you know, and he's named in the book, you know, and they're supposed to make

2:16:56.800 --> 2:17:03.200
 a movie on it. So I'm like, hey, who's going to play it? But what he's done, to me, it changed the

2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:08.320
 game and here's why. Because I said, you know, in, I think it was 62 when Eisenhower warned of the

2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:13.520
 industrial defense complex, you know, which it has become everything he warned us of,

2:17:13.520 --> 2:17:20.400
 you know, it has become. And it's really driven by, there's the big three in defense, which is

2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:26.240
 really Northrop, Lockheed, and Boeing. Those are the big, those are your bigs. And Raytheon's kind

2:17:26.240 --> 2:17:31.200
 of right, like a subset of that, but Raytheon's pretty big too. But in U.S. defense, those are

2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:34.400
 the big guys, right? That's actually where a lot of military guys go and they retire, they

2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:40.880
 go do stuff like that. So when you look at that and you go in the way government contracting

2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:45.840
 is working and how we charge and, you know, why things cost so much. And then you go, you got

2:17:45.840 --> 2:17:51.360
 Elon, who's got an ego, you know, and he doesn't like to do things certain way. And I've talked

2:17:51.360 --> 2:17:55.200
 to the guy that worked there on, you know, because the government likes to have oversight of contracts

2:17:55.200 --> 2:17:58.880
 where he was like, no, just tell me what you want. I'll build it and I'll give you a bill when it's

2:17:58.880 --> 2:18:04.080
 done. And then if I do it for half the price, I make a ton of money because he's money driven guy,

2:18:04.080 --> 2:18:10.560
 which I like capitalism at its best. So now you look at the two things. So you got the space

2:18:10.560 --> 2:18:17.440
 X, which is the dragon capsule, right? And then you've got Boeing. So Elon did what Boeing is

2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:24.000
 contracted to do in less time for half the money. And oh, by the way, because he can reuse the

2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:27.680
 boosters because they come back and land and you don't have to like Morton Thycall, we've

2:18:27.680 --> 2:18:30.960
 reused them on the space shuttle, but they had to take them all apart and do a bunch of stuff

2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:34.480
 because they landed in saltwater and then you had to put them all back together where Elon gets

2:18:34.480 --> 2:18:38.400
 them down because I was joking with this guy. I go, what do they do? Do they like re rehaul,

2:18:38.400 --> 2:18:41.120
 you know, overhaul me because no, actually they clean them up and they can use them again. They're

2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:46.800
 reusable systems. Incredible leap in technology that no one thought of, but here's a private company.

2:18:46.800 --> 2:18:50.640
 So being able to put people on and the capsule and the space suits, I mean, it's literally like

2:18:50.640 --> 2:18:57.040
 sci fi when you watch when they went up. So I'm a huge fan of what he and his company have been

2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:01.680
 able to do because, you know, the fact that we were paying huge amounts of money to the Russian

2:19:01.680 --> 2:19:04.800
 government, you know, and oh, by the way, if you didn't know, because I have some friends that are

2:19:04.800 --> 2:19:11.760
 astronauts, they all have to learn Russian, right? And they have to do, it's what level five where

2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:15.680
 the test is a phone call where they call you up and they, you know, because they would go,

2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:20.800
 so I went to the pinning and two friends of mine. The one actually had a mission date,

2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:24.960
 the one got one later. So it's cool when you're watching your friends doing a space walk, you

2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:28.000
 know, because I would pull up because if I knew it was going on, I'd pull up the NASA thing. I was

2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:32.640
 in a meeting one day and I've got NASA on and makers out there floating around, you know,

2:19:32.640 --> 2:19:36.000
 doing his stuff. And I saw one, he's in the space station while they're doing a space walk. So it's

2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:39.120
 kind of cool when you go, oh, yeah, I know that dude, he's up there in space, floating around.

2:19:40.560 --> 2:19:48.000
 So when you look at what those, they're capable of doing and then you go, what Elon is bringing to

2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:56.720
 the fact that now it's back in America, it's actually, to me, it's cost effective for us to

2:19:56.720 --> 2:20:02.080
 be able to do more stuff. I think it opens the door to, do we go back to the moon? Is there a

2:20:02.080 --> 2:20:05.280
 reason to go back to the moon? Personally, I think if we're going to, if they're really going to go,

2:20:05.280 --> 2:20:09.120
 you know, in years from now, go to Mars, I think that the moon is the stepping stone to go back

2:20:09.120 --> 2:20:13.920
 to start proving some of the technology to go, hey, we can build this, we can get on the moon,

2:20:13.920 --> 2:20:21.120
 and now we can get back off the moon because we did this on a less than a compact computer in the

2:20:21.120 --> 2:20:25.520
 60s, which is the whole reason that I flew because I'm obsessed. Matter of fact, I have the giant

2:20:25.520 --> 2:20:32.560
 Lego Apollo at home and the Lander and I have one that my dad built me in 1969, right after that.

2:20:33.520 --> 2:20:37.680
 And Neil Armstrong's an Ohio boy and so am I. Matter of fact, I have a picture of him in a

2:20:37.680 --> 2:20:41.440
 car in Wapa Caneta, Ohio at the parade after he walked on the moon because his parents didn't

2:20:41.440 --> 2:20:46.560
 live far from my aunt and uncle in Wapa Caneta and they were out at the parade. So I've been obsessed

2:20:46.560 --> 2:20:52.480
 with this since I was a child. Do you hope to, do you think, do you hope that you'll go out to

2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:59.440
 the space one day? Me, if I had the opportunity, I'd go in a second, you know, I am not. Because

2:20:59.440 --> 2:21:05.760
 I mean, that's one of the hopes of the commercial spaceflight is that, you know, like people like,

2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:11.040
 I mean, it would be a tourism, but you certainly wouldn't want to, in terms of, you're not kind

2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:15.680
 of a civilian, right? I mean, in a sense that you're just a normal person, you're not a fighter

2:21:15.680 --> 2:21:21.760
 jet pilot currently, but it seems like if we send a civilian up there would be somebody like you

2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:26.400
 in the next like 20 years. I'd be, you know, if Elon wants to throw me all those things,

2:21:26.400 --> 2:21:29.360
 I'd be all over it. I don't know what my wife would say, but you know, sometimes you gotta,

2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:32.800
 gotta get your kicks while you're alive. I'd love to hear that discussion with your wife.

2:21:32.800 --> 2:21:38.480
 Listen, there's the pros and cons. She's, she's, I mean, I've known her since high school. So she,

2:21:38.480 --> 2:21:42.240
 yeah, she knows how I am, you know, most people that know me are like, yeah, you're pretty much

2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:46.080
 the same person you were in high school. You know, I was a class clown and I still am that way.

2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:52.960
 Okay. So, let me ask you this question about, so I'm talking to Elon again soon. I'm curious

2:21:52.960 --> 2:22:02.320
 to get your perspective on it. If I wanted to talk to him about Tic Tac, about these weird

2:22:02.320 --> 2:22:08.720
 out there propulsion ideas, which are obviously just like you said, if there's something to it,

2:22:08.720 --> 2:22:14.240
 if it can be investigated somehow, it would be extremely useful for us to understand in the

2:22:14.240 --> 2:22:20.560
 effort of developing propulsion systems that can get us cheaply to out the space. What,

2:22:21.200 --> 2:22:25.840
 what should Elon think about this stuff? What should he do? What should people like him?

2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:31.600
 I think people need to open their aperture up and stay off of, take the next step and go,

2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:38.160
 you know, we are tied to fuels and either solid rocket or liquid or whatever we do,

2:22:38.160 --> 2:22:42.080
 but it's a thrust generated where we rapidly expand gas to create thrust,

2:22:42.080 --> 2:22:47.040
 which is really in layman's terms, you know, we can get into what, but that's what it does.

2:22:48.560 --> 2:22:55.840
 If you have something that you can contain that is a fuel source that would last a significant

2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:00.400
 amount of time, you know, those rocket boosters go and when they're done, they're done. There's

2:23:00.400 --> 2:23:04.240
 enough to get them back down. That's it. There's not a huge, you know, not coming back and go,

2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:08.080
 oh, I still got three quarters of a tank. Let's bolt them on and do it again. His system is not

2:23:08.080 --> 2:23:14.240
 doing that. But, you know, the way, the way contracting, especially in the government,

2:23:14.240 --> 2:23:18.080
 the government has tons of money, but you got to remember the government has to justify how

2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:22.000
 they spend our tax dollars for the most part. There's times where they can hide money in the

2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:26.080
 budget to get stuff done. But then when you look at, and I'm just going to throw a few out there,

2:23:26.080 --> 2:23:33.200
 but if you look at what Amazon, you know, does with Bezos and you've got Elon,

2:23:33.200 --> 2:23:39.520
 there's some, there's some big money out there. I mean, you're talking, you know, Bezos alone

2:23:39.520 --> 2:23:46.160
 could buy companies like big companies, Apple's another one. These companies had huge, huge

2:23:46.160 --> 2:23:51.440
 amounts of money and then just go over to the Gates Foundation and they've got gazillions

2:23:51.440 --> 2:23:55.840
 and gazillions of dollars. We've got universities. There's so much money out there. If we really

2:23:55.840 --> 2:24:01.120
 wanted to do it, aside from what the government wants to do, because we do live in a free society,

2:24:01.120 --> 2:24:09.040
 I think there's enough to go, how do we do this? And because when you work outside of what the

2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:13.680
 government would want to do, we're not working on this necessarily for the United States,

2:24:13.680 --> 2:24:18.640
 although I am a huge giant. I would never, yeah, I am an American.

2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:21.680
 You're talking to somebody born in the Soviet Union. I can't believe you agreed to this.

2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:32.080
 But I haven't killed me yet. Yeah, well, you're here. And you've been here for a while.

2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:36.240
 No, I'm joking. I'm an American citizen. I'm actually pretty much American.

2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:39.680
 But see, when you do that, so you look at, let's just look at American universities.

2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:43.520
 Yes. So there's some brilliant minds and we'll just use MIT because you worked down there.

2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:47.440
 There's some brilliant minds, but there's a huge chunk of those brilliant minds that are not American

2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:51.440
 citizens. So if you want to get into government stuff and you are not an American citizen,

2:24:51.440 --> 2:24:56.880
 it gets really, really, really hard. But if I take money like Bezos money, Elon money,

2:24:57.520 --> 2:25:02.560
 and let's just say they want to work together, they can split it up 50, 50, the two of them,

2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:06.960
 when the technology gets developed. But now I'm not constrained by who has to do the work.

2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:09.840
 I just want to make sure that I try and keep it in the United States because

2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:13.920
 technology is technology. And if it gets developed and gets over to where

2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:18.880
 a country gets ahold of it and then just basically uses it for their own because

2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:23.520
 you save them all the research time, you don't want to do that. But if we can get to the point

2:25:23.520 --> 2:25:27.680
 where we do it on the International Space Station, we realize that space was too expensive

2:25:27.680 --> 2:25:31.520
 for one country to do alone. So we made the International Space Station and we have

2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:37.360
 conglomerate. It's the one thing that the Russians in the US actually work together on.

2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:42.640
 Think about it. That's it. We work together on space because we realize it's way too expensive

2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:46.800
 for us to do alone and effective. So we've got this thing that's been out there floating around

2:25:46.800 --> 2:25:50.080
 for God now. What is it? Like 20 years that things been up there floating around? So it's

2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:54.960
 getting old. We're going to have to replace parts and do stuff. But if we can pool the money together

2:25:54.960 --> 2:25:58.880
 and come up with something that would literally change mankind and change travel and allow us to

2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:04.080
 actually do a more effective thing of exploring. Because if you develop that technology, you don't

2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:09.200
 even have to send a man person. If you can develop a technology that's so with our automation and

2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:14.960
 where we're progressing and our computing power to send something out that's not just floating

2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:20.240
 around when it can react a lot quicker. Something that could actually go down to the surface and

2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:23.680
 come back up. So right now everything we get out of Mars, it goes down there and then it just sends

2:26:23.680 --> 2:26:27.520
 data back. Get an analyzer. But if I've got a technology that can go up there really quick,

2:26:27.520 --> 2:26:30.800
 I'm not worried about man, I don't have life support systems and all that. But it can go down,

2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:35.120
 it can go, it can cruise around, it can hover above, it can take samples, and it can actually

2:26:35.120 --> 2:26:40.800
 take Martian soil and then bring it back. So we can analyze it here. That's a game changer.

2:26:40.800 --> 2:26:47.040
 It's a complete game changer because it opens up all the planets. Exactly. So in the sense that

2:26:47.040 --> 2:26:53.760
 the Tic Tac is a symbol. So whatever you think, even from a debunking perspective,

2:26:53.760 --> 2:27:01.120
 there's a nonzero probability that it's alien technology. And in that sense, it serves as a

2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:10.080
 beacon of hope and a reason to, like you said, widen the aperture and to invest big amounts of

2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:20.240
 money into thinking outside the box. Like it's almost a hope to say we can do better propulsion.

2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:27.040
 We can overcome physics in an order of magnitude better way. And it's worthwhile to try.

2:27:27.040 --> 2:27:30.160
 I think, and I don't think the money, if you look at a big picture with the amount of money,

2:27:30.160 --> 2:27:34.000
 some of that's out there floating around these private companies, you know, I think if you said,

2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:37.680
 hey, I've got, let's just say a hundred million dollars, which really a hundred million dollars

2:27:37.680 --> 2:27:41.920
 relative to Bezos has got what, a hundred and some billion dollars in that word. So if he said,

2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:46.960
 hey, a hundred million dollars, you drop a hundred million dollars and I go, and I'm going to put a,

2:27:46.960 --> 2:27:50.480
 you know, like the government will send a broad area announcement out that says, hey,

2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:55.200
 we're looking for this technology or a DARPA program. But what if I just said, hey, who's to

2:27:55.200 --> 2:28:00.000
 stop Bezos and Elon from doing that on their own to say, hey, I want to go pool universities because

2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:03.520
 they have fewer restrictions because it's not tax dollars. They don't have the checks and bounds.

2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:08.000
 They can do whatever they want. So they're money. Oh, I'm sorry about that. To go, hey,

2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:12.400
 I'm going to put this out and I'm going to get the best physicists that are working at CERN,

2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:17.120
 that are at MIT, that are at Caltech at the schools I mentioned. And oh, by the way,

2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:21.440
 a few of these guys are propulsion experts. And I'm going to basically, I'm going to fund you guys

2:28:21.440 --> 2:28:26.560
 for 10 years. So you get 10 million dollars a year and I'm going to give you your salaries and

2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:29.600
 we're going to do that or whatever the amount works. So let's cut it down to five so we can pay

2:28:29.600 --> 2:28:34.880
 you well, right? To do the research. But oh, by the way, the research is, it's not classified,

2:28:34.880 --> 2:28:39.360
 but it's controlled. So we're not going to publicly just put this out in journals. But if we make a

2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:44.560
 leap that we think would advance because although those, let's say there's 10 of them, those 10

2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:49.120
 scientists come up with something and they put out a paper, there might be another number 11

2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:54.080
 at another university that reads that paper and says, hey, I kind of had this idea. And now you

2:28:54.080 --> 2:29:00.320
 can get a thought pool that pushes us in and gets us out of the mindset because we have a tendency to

2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:07.120
 we evolve the stuff that we create. But it's like I was joking because I know a ton of guys with

2:29:07.120 --> 2:29:12.240
 PhDs and girls. And I said, but you know, how much when a person gets a PhD in like engineering,

2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:16.080
 how much new math is really being done? I said, there's a handful of people in the world that

2:29:16.080 --> 2:29:21.440
 are really doing, I'm talking, I'm talking Stephen Hawkins type brilliance that is going,

2:29:21.440 --> 2:29:27.840
 I'm really doing something that's totally different. That's a big dramatic thing now going on in

2:29:27.840 --> 2:29:32.960
 physics that everybody's just, everybody's converged towards this local minima or local

2:29:32.960 --> 2:29:37.440
 maximum, whatever you think about it. And it's, it's again, same as with the Tic Tac,

2:29:38.160 --> 2:29:44.800
 thinking outside the box is not, is not accepted. And it probably should be.

2:29:44.800 --> 2:29:49.120
 But it's hard because if you go back, go back to Einstein, back to the original,

2:29:49.120 --> 2:29:56.880
 he was the, he was out of the box. He did not think that he did not thought out of the box and

2:29:56.880 --> 2:30:02.800
 came up with some of his theories. Where would we be? Okay, we're jumping around a little bit.

2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:09.920
 So we talked a little bit about Elon and Mars and space, but let's let me jump back to a few

2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:15.760
 questions that folks had. I have to kind of bring up some debunking stuff, because I think not the

2:30:15.760 --> 2:30:22.800
 actual idea, not the actual facts of the debunking, but the nature of the true believers versus the

2:30:22.800 --> 2:30:28.320
 debunkers hurts my heart a little bit because people are just talking past each other. But let

2:30:28.320 --> 2:30:36.000
 me kind of bring it up. Mick West, I've just recently started to pay attention just in preparing to

2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:40.480
 talk to you about this world. And Mick West is one of the better known people who kind of makes a

2:30:40.480 --> 2:30:49.360
 career out of trying to debunk sort of he's a, his natural approach to all situations is that of a

2:30:49.360 --> 2:30:54.160
 skeptic. I think it's, it's very useful and powerful, especially for me coming from a scientific

2:30:54.160 --> 2:31:00.480
 perspective to take the approach he does. It's valuable. And I think no matter what, I think

2:31:00.480 --> 2:31:06.880
 there's, I hope that people quote unquote true believers are a little bit more open minded to

2:31:06.880 --> 2:31:13.120
 the work of Mick West. I think it's quite useful and brilliant work. So let me ask, he has a bunch

2:31:13.120 --> 2:31:18.640
 of videos, a bunch of ideas where he kind of suggests possible other explanations of the

2:31:18.640 --> 2:31:27.040
 things that were out there. He has some explanations of the things that you've seen in with the

2:31:27.040 --> 2:31:34.480
 tic tac, like with your own eyes, like he says that it's possible that you miscalculated the size

2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:39.120
 and the distance of the thing and so on when you were flying on. I don't fight that as a,

2:31:39.120 --> 2:31:43.600
 I mean, maybe you can comment on that. Let me do it right now. Sure. So because that comes up,

2:31:43.600 --> 2:31:50.640
 like how did you know it was about 40 feet long? I go, okay, so 16 years flying against other

2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:55.680
 airplanes, know what stuff looks like, you know, I've looked down on things. So if I know, I know,

2:31:55.680 --> 2:32:01.200
 here's the known things. I know when we saw the tic tac, I was at 20,000 feet ish right around there.

2:32:01.200 --> 2:32:05.680
 So when I look down, I know what a hornet looks like looking down on them because I've done it

2:32:05.680 --> 2:32:10.160
 for all those years. I mean, I got a good idea. So that's why I said 40 feet because it's about

2:32:10.160 --> 2:32:15.360
 hornet size. So and as I go around, you get to the point where you have to be able to judge

2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:21.760
 distance when we fly out of experience and you can tell if something small or big, you know,

2:32:23.360 --> 2:32:27.840
 so I would argue the fact of, you know, pure experience, there's, you know,

2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:31.440
 you know, professional observers, which is what we're actually trained to do.

2:32:33.520 --> 2:32:37.920
 And having done it for so long, no, it was, and everyone came back with the same thing.

2:32:37.920 --> 2:32:41.600
 They're like, yeah, it's about size of hornet. From a human factors perspective,

2:32:42.320 --> 2:32:50.080
 how often in your experience of those 16 years, do you find that I, what you see

2:32:50.720 --> 2:32:55.920
 is the incorrect state of things. So like, how often do you make mistakes with vision?

2:32:55.920 --> 2:33:02.400
 You actually, you make vision issues a lot because you're, and the sad part is your brain

2:33:02.400 --> 2:33:07.600
 believes what your eyes see. We are actually trained to do the opposite of that, especially

2:33:07.600 --> 2:33:13.840
 when you instrument fly, because your brain and eyes can tell you one thing, but you got to trust

2:33:13.840 --> 2:33:21.680
 your instruments. Let's go back to landing at night. So your eyes assume that the runway and

2:33:21.680 --> 2:33:27.200
 your brain assumes that the runway is fixed, but you know that the runway is moving. So if I try

2:33:27.200 --> 2:33:32.560
 and do stuff visually, I would, you die every time. Well, not every time, but you die close to

2:33:32.560 --> 2:33:36.720
 every time trying to land on a boat. So we actually use instruments with your counter

2:33:36.720 --> 2:33:40.320
 to your brain. So, and there's actually all kinds of things that we go through in training.

2:33:40.880 --> 2:33:44.800
 They have this thing, I think they still use it. It's called the MSD,

2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:51.920
 multi spatial disorientation device, or the spin and puke. It looks like a giant

2:33:51.920 --> 2:33:55.040
 carousel and you're in these little modules. And when you get out, you think the thing goes

2:33:55.040 --> 2:34:00.080
 really fast and they can, you can make yourself think that I'm descending or climbing, but you're

2:34:00.080 --> 2:34:04.320
 actually only going around in circles at a very slow rate as fast as a human can talk. But as they

2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:09.040
 spin you around in the little sub thing and slow it down and speed it up, your body does this and

2:34:09.040 --> 2:34:13.600
 you, you know, and then by visuals of showing you like they can spin it sideways to the outside

2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:17.600
 wall, but they can show like lines that are, they can make the line stand still because they're

2:34:17.600 --> 2:34:20.480
 moving the same velocity. They can move in the other way and you'll think you're screaming.

2:34:20.480 --> 2:34:26.000
 You see it in amusement parks all the time. You do all that because it gives you a sense of

2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:30.080
 the A, but you're really not doing, you're sitting there. So we get trained on all that stuff. So if

2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:33.760
 you, if you want to look at it and go, well, you're, you're disoriented or this I'd be like,

2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:38.000
 I'd argue going, no, I'm not because, you know, when I'm flying the airplane, even as I'm looking

2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:43.600
 at the tic tac, I've got a heads up display that tells me what my airplane's doing. So I've got, I

2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:47.360
 know what I'm doing. I can look outside. I've got a sense of what I'm doing, but I'm also looking

2:34:47.360 --> 2:34:52.080
 inside to cross check of what I'm seeing is in reality what I'm doing. You actually, your brain

2:34:52.080 --> 2:34:57.440
 gotten good at combining almost adding extra sensory information. You have to, you have like

2:34:57.440 --> 2:35:02.400
 supervision. So you're combining what you're seeing and adjusting what the sensors, what you call

2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:08.560
 an instruments are giving you. And that, that in turn is a loop that adjusts the perception system

2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:13.040
 that like, that it, that adjusts your brain's interpretation of what you're seeing.

2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:17.840
 You'd be amazed at how good. So here's, here's another example. So if we go out over the water,

2:35:17.840 --> 2:35:22.000
 so there's no land in sight and we're going to fight. So when we fight, you know,

2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:28.640
 two airplanes, we're going to dog fight as an instructor and I was for most of my time,

2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:35.440
 you have to come back and you have to recreate it. So we call it drawing arrows. So you have to

2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:40.640
 recreate that stuff. So you get pretty good at going, you know, like, I would take off and say,

2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:46.640
 right, we're starting heading due East. And I know where the sun is at, because in the short

2:35:46.640 --> 2:35:49.200
 couple of minutes that we're going to fight, the sun's really not going to move much. It's going

2:35:49.200 --> 2:35:55.200
 to be in a relative zone. I know that the sun is at, you know, let's just say 195 degrees,

2:35:55.200 --> 2:35:59.920
 right? So I'm starting going East and it's actually be down off my right hand side.

2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:03.280
 So now I know as I'm fighting, because in the water, you don't have any reference like, oh,

2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:07.040
 I passed land, I passed land. No, you don't. And you can't use clouds because clouds do move,

2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:09.760
 but you got to come back because you go, here's where I started. And then you,

2:36:09.760 --> 2:36:15.520
 when, as soon as you end, you go, all right, I ended heading 355. And then you recreate the

2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:19.520
 turns and the amount of turns and use the sun relative. So you can create this entire

2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:24.160
 battle that went on with arrows so that you can come back and debrief the guy that you were teaching

2:36:24.160 --> 2:36:29.600
 on exactly what happened. And you get really, really good at that. So when you come up and go,

2:36:29.600 --> 2:36:32.640
 well, Dave, how do you know you were at six o clock? And you went around and he came up here,

2:36:32.640 --> 2:36:38.560
 I go, because I'm trained to do all that. And I take all the notes, why I'm flying, you can do

2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:42.880
 it. But usually it's, you memorize it all and you get done. And then you read, as soon as you're

2:36:42.880 --> 2:36:45.360
 done, you knock it off, you look at the other airplane, you get sent and you start writing

2:36:45.360 --> 2:36:49.360
 all your notes down. Yeah. And you're writing it really fast on your cart and you go out with a

2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:52.160
 stack of cards and you stick the new one on your knee board card. So you're ready to go. And here's

2:36:52.160 --> 2:37:00.400
 the next setup. It's kind of, it's in some way similar to what like at the highest level chess

2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:09.840
 players do. I mean, you're, I mean, they, they, they recap the games, but the, the richness

2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:15.680
 of the representation that they use in remembering like how the games evolved. It's not like,

2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:21.680
 it's much richer than the actual moves. It's like these, a bunch of patterns that are hard to put

2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:27.840
 into words, like, like all the richness of thinking they have about the way they game

2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:34.160
 evolved. It's more like instinctual from years and years of experience. So they try to put it

2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:39.200
 into words, but they really can't. It's, it's just. I understand that. It's because for us,

2:37:39.200 --> 2:37:43.600
 if we don't come back with anything, then there's no learning to be had. Cause the whole thing is

2:37:43.600 --> 2:37:48.560
 the debrief when we get back and we talk about, that's really where they're learning is. And it's

2:37:48.560 --> 2:37:52.560
 the same thing. If you want to go back to chess, you know, when you start off, you try and learn

2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:56.000
 because you're remembering what you're doing. If you play against someone, I'm always a big place,

2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:59.840
 play with someone better than you. That's how you learn. If you're constantly beating people,

2:37:59.840 --> 2:38:03.600
 you're not learning anything. You're just learning that they're not good and you're better. When you,

2:38:03.600 --> 2:38:09.600
 when you challenge yourself against someone that is going to, is better than you, you learn. So I

2:38:09.600 --> 2:38:14.880
 learned how to fight an airplane with, he's actually one of my best friends. We'll call him

2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:20.000
 Tom. I won't give his call sign because I don't, he wasn't. So Tom took me out and taught me how

2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:25.360
 to fight because Tom had just left Top Gun. He was the, the, the training officer at Top Gun,

2:38:25.360 --> 2:38:30.960
 which so that's the guy, the training officers, the main guy at Top Gun. So Tom was the training

2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:35.360
 officer at Top Gun. So Tom, when I learned, cause I had come out of A six and we really don't fight

2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:39.680
 because it was a bomber. So I get in F 18s and I want to learn how to fight because it's a whole

2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:44.480
 other side of the mission. It's the F and F fighter attack. The F A 18 is fighter attack. So I had

2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:48.800
 to learn how to fight. So now I got one of the best fighter pilots in the world who's going to teach

2:38:48.800 --> 2:38:54.320
 me how to do it. And he did. And I would do something and then he would go, I'd get to a

2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:58.080
 situation where I had never been and then I would go, well, I'm going to do this. And then he would

2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:03.120
 destroy me and he would come back and go, here's why you don't do that. And then I would take that

2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:08.000
 knowledge and I would put it in my little basket of tricks and over time, cause you don't, no one

2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:13.360
 walks out into that world. I don't care how gifted of an aviator and go, I am the man or the woman.

2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:19.920
 I am it. No, it's a learning process. And so over all those years, you've gotten good. So I mean,

2:39:21.760 --> 2:39:28.160
 so what are the chances that your eyes betrays you when you saw the tic tac?

2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:40.080
 The tic tac low zero. Well, I mean, I'm not zero. So 90, I am 99.9%. So 0.1%. My eyes deceive me.

2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:44.880
 But remember, if it deceived me, it had to deceive the other four people. So the percentage is even

2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:50.400
 lower. Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't find that particular debunking case that you said, but I'm glad you

2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:58.160
 put it. You, you said those words out loud. So for me, from my perspective, coming into this world

2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:05.360
 and looking at it, I'm a little bit more skeptical. So your eye account, I think is the most fascinating

2:40:05.360 --> 2:40:13.120
 story. And that I think that's inspiring to me and should be inspiring to a lot of scientists out

2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:19.040
 there. It's on so many levels, just like we said, on the engineering level, that maybe there's

2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:26.560
 propulsion systems where we can actually build that can do some crazy, amazing stuff. So it's

2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:32.080
 at the very least intriguing and at the best inspiring. I just want to say that. But on the

2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:44.800
 video side, it's like, it's the videos for the FLIR video, the GoFast and the Gimbal video,

2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:53.520
 they are only interesting to me, to me in the context of your story. Like without that, they're

2:40:53.520 --> 2:41:01.600
 kind of low resolution. It's like, it's easier to build a debunking story to be skeptical. So

2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:05.840
 that's just where I'm coming from. Maybe you can convince me otherwise. But so to bring up

2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:12.640
 Mick West one more time, he looks at the FLIR video and he says that one of the most amazing

2:41:12.640 --> 2:41:22.480
 parts of the FLIR video where people haven't seen it is at the end of it, the tic tac

2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:32.080
 flies or appears to fly very quickly to the left off the screen off the screen. And what Mick West

2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:41.680
 says is that it, you know, Mick West, probably others that the way to explain that is the tracking

2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:49.600
 system. Like we said, this vision based tracking simply loses the like the object, the tracking

2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:57.040
 loses it. And so it simply allows the object to float off screen because it's no longer tracking

2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:06.400
 it. So I find that at least a plausible explanation of that video. Looking at your face, you do not.

2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:15.760
 So can you maybe comment to that debunking aspect? Sure, I will. So it's funny how people can

2:42:15.760 --> 2:42:19.920
 extrapolate stuff who've never operated the system. No, for sure. And that's like me going,

2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:25.200
 because I'm a big Formula One fan, you know, that's like me going, oh my god, Lewis, what were you

2:42:25.200 --> 2:42:28.240
 doing? You could have done this with the car and you'd have won the race. You know, and Lewis

2:42:28.240 --> 2:42:32.320
 Hamilton right now is defending world champion two times. He's four times, four or five times world

2:42:32.320 --> 2:42:37.520
 champion. But that would be pretty stupid of me to try and tell Lewis Hamilton how to drive a car.

2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:44.720
 As a matter of fact, anyone driving a Formula One car. So I can't tell you how many times I've

2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:48.960
 watched. You gotta remember when we looked at this thing, when Chad came back with the video,

2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:52.160
 we sat there and watched it. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I watched it off the original

2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:58.320
 tapes going, all right, all right, let's look at this. Because you can look and see where the

2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:01.600
 airplane's going. You can see if it's looking left or right. And if you actually watch all that

2:43:01.600 --> 2:43:06.160
 stuff, it doesn't do that. It actually, when the vehicle starts to move, the bars, the tracking

2:43:06.160 --> 2:43:09.440
 gate starts to open up and the people at Raytheon could probably add to this because they built

2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:15.600
 the pod. The tracking gate will start to open up. But the thing, when it leaves so fast off the

2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:19.440
 screen, the pod can't move fast enough, it has gimbal rates on how fast that thing can move

2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:23.920
 around. Because there's another theory that, oh, the pod's looking forward. When the pod passes

2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:27.200
 underneath the airplane, so if I'm looking at you and you pass underneath me as it does this,

2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:33.040
 the ball will actually flip around to kind of finish off. And it swaps ends because it has,

2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:38.800
 you know, it's a gimbal. It can't just, it's not free floating. But there's a theory on one of

2:43:38.800 --> 2:43:42.080
 them, oh, it's here and it flipped over. It doesn't do that when it's looking out in front. It stays

2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:47.840
 like this. So yet another debunker who doesn't know this. So, you know, and Mick has had several

2:43:47.840 --> 2:43:53.680
 theories on some of the other videos, like one of them, the GoFats as a bird and Jeremy Corbell

2:43:53.680 --> 2:43:59.760
 actually did a nice job of saying, no, it's not because he's on black hot. So the white object

2:43:59.760 --> 2:44:04.720
 is actually colder than the ocean. That's fine. Well, birds aren't colder than the ocean. They'd

2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:13.200
 be dead. So the gimbal video to comment on the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation,

2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:20.800
 the apparent rotation of the object that is something that is not possible to do with systems

2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:30.320
 that we know of. And Mick West suggests that a flare like reflections or whatever can explain.

2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:34.720
 No, because what Mick West doesn't see is so when they take, because I've talked to the,

2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:40.800
 one of them actually I work with. So I know him, I know I talk to him all the time. So,

2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:46.000
 and it's his best friend actually shot the video, one of his best friends for the

2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:49.440
 gimbal video, the gimbal video, both of them, the GoFats and the gimbal were shot by the same

2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:54.880
 person. Yeah. Okay. So, and they were in each other's wedding. So that's how well they know each

2:44:54.880 --> 2:45:01.280
 other. Okay. So what you don't see is so the airplanes, they're flying still super hornets,

2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:05.440
 but they have the APG 79, which is the new phased array radar that's made by Raytheon,

2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:11.280
 things incredible. Okay. It doesn't, usually if it's, if it's out there and it sees it, it's real.

2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:14.160
 So at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing stuff and then they

2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:17.280
 actually threw one of the targeting pods out there. Well, the targeting pod, there's heat

2:45:17.280 --> 2:45:21.040
 signature and you go, Hey, dot heat signature, something's there. It's real. It's not,

2:45:21.040 --> 2:45:25.760
 you're not picking up some extraneous things. So what you see in the gimbal video of the thing

2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:28.640
 and it rotates and you go, Holy shit, look at that thing. It's just sitting there and it's in

2:45:28.640 --> 2:45:32.960
 the wind and it's going against the wind. Why it's doing this, you know, someone goes, Oh,

2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:36.160
 it's an airplane. No, if an airplane does this, it's eventually going to start to change aspect

2:45:36.160 --> 2:45:39.840
 because it's in a turn. This thing doesn't change aspect. It just rotates. It's just rotating.

2:45:39.840 --> 2:45:44.560
 Right. The other thing that you see when you talk to them is, so they're on their radar,

2:45:44.560 --> 2:45:50.480
 there's an object that they identify as their number one priority or their launch and steering.

2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:54.800
 So when they designate that, that's where the targeting pods going to look. That's what you

2:45:54.800 --> 2:45:59.440
 get in the gimbal video. There's five other, I think it's five. They're kind of in a V, you know,

2:45:59.440 --> 2:46:03.600
 like a geese would fly that are out in front of it and they're actually coming, they're out in

2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:07.520
 front of it and they actually turn on the radar and go the other way while they're filming the

2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:16.400
 gimbal video, which I know Ryan has come out and talked about it. But when you see it, you go,

2:46:17.040 --> 2:46:20.960
 you know, if you take it in context because you go, Oh, it's just the video. Well, if you take

2:46:20.960 --> 2:46:24.560
 the video with a radar going, no, there's actually other things out there because there's at least

2:46:24.560 --> 2:46:30.080
 60 people that have seen these things on radar off the vacapes. It was, it actually became,

2:46:31.040 --> 2:46:34.400
 I called a buddy of mine who was running the wing at the time, the fighter wing.

2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:36.960
 I said, dude, what are you guys doing about this? He goes, well, we got to note him out,

2:46:36.960 --> 2:46:41.520
 which is a notice to airmen, which means there's these objects out there in the warning area.

2:46:41.520 --> 2:46:44.880
 So anyone can, you can fly a Cessna through the warning area. It's all the warning area tells

2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:48.240
 you is that there's high military traffic and training out here. It's probably best not to be

2:46:48.240 --> 2:46:53.600
 here, but there's nothing that prohibits you from going in there. So these things have the right

2:46:53.600 --> 2:46:57.600
 wherever they're from or whatever they are, you know, cause people are like, oh, they're balloons.

2:46:57.600 --> 2:47:02.800
 Well, balloons float. Balloons don't sit in 70 knots of wind and stay in the same location.

2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:06.880
 They had an airplane because there was two, there's the gimbal thing. That's a pretty big object.

2:47:07.920 --> 2:47:11.280
 There's also, they talk about, it looks like a cube that's inside of a sphere.

2:47:11.280 --> 2:47:15.840
 A translucent sphere. What the hell is that? And they almost hit one.

2:47:15.840 --> 2:47:19.360
 It's almost hit them. So that's another, that's one of the biggest,

2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:26.240
 another biggest account is like almost hit a plane, something that appeared to be a cube in a

2:47:26.240 --> 2:47:33.760
 translucent sphere. What do you make of that? Again, you know, what, what, I mean, that, that's,

2:47:33.760 --> 2:47:38.400
 that's the most dangerous. You're right. The biggest frustration is when you do that and you go,

2:47:38.400 --> 2:47:43.280
 okay, so this thing passed between two airplanes and it was, I think it was like 100 feet or

2:47:43.280 --> 2:47:46.560
 something like that of the airplane and almost hit it. So what they do is they come back and go,

2:47:46.560 --> 2:47:50.880
 hey, I had a near midair. What'd you have a near midair with? Now this floating beach ball with

2:47:50.880 --> 2:47:56.320
 this cube inside of it and you go, huh? So they send out a no tam again and they, they do a,

2:47:56.320 --> 2:48:00.000
 what's called a hazard report that says, hey, there's these objects out there. We almost hit one

2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:05.760
 here and that gets sent off to the Naval Safety Center. What was done? I mean, what are you going

2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:10.720
 to do? Can you catch one, go out with a giant net and try and bag one? You don't know because

2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:14.000
 they've seen them. They've picked them up like hovering on radar and then all of a sudden they're

2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:18.480
 traveling at really high rates of speed. So, you know, what are you going to do?

2:48:18.480 --> 2:48:22.240
 Well, and that, let me ask this because this is what people kind of think about.

2:48:24.560 --> 2:48:31.520
 After you witnessed Tic Tac and after this, these incidents, as far as we know, with the gimbal and

2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:41.600
 the Go Fast, it seems like people in the military did not, did not react like what, like did not

2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:48.560
 freak out. It almost like was like a mundane event. How do you explain that? Why didn't the people on

2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:55.200
 the ship not, the higher ups, why wasn't there a big freak out? Or as some people suggest,

2:48:55.200 --> 2:49:00.400
 the higher ups knew about it all along and just were not letting everyone know that there's some

2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:08.320
 kind of secret military, you know, like tests almost. So let's talk about, so let's say you've

2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:13.920
 got this cool new toy. You call it a cool new toy. You typically don't take your cool new toy out

2:49:13.920 --> 2:49:18.400
 into an area where the cool new toy could get damaged or what if the airplane would have actually

2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:22.800
 hit your cool new toy and you got two people that are ejecting or dead and you got a, you know,

2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:28.560
 $80 million airplane that's now in the bottom of the Atlantic. You know, tests are normally done

2:49:28.560 --> 2:49:33.280
 in controlled environments. It's like any test, a lab test or whatever. When you take things out

2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:38.080
 into the real world, you know, you're still going to test it in an area where something goes wrong.

2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:43.440
 So when they started and we'll go back to Elon, so my friend that worked there, they had a rocket

2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:49.120
 go off. They were out in quadruple and when the rocket went up, a fuel line ruptured in the rocket

2:49:49.120 --> 2:49:53.360
 and it ran out of fuel before it got all the way up and it came falling back down. Well,

2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:58.320
 when you're out on an atoll in the Pacific, if it's going up above you, the worst case is going

2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:02.240
 to land on you. So you're worried about where else is it going to land and it actually crashed

2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:08.320
 next to the atoll and, you know, Elon wasn't happy and threw this guy under the bus. So

2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:13.760
 that's a test environment because you don't know what's going to happen. So because someone said,

2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:16.880
 well, when we chase the TicTac, well, it could have been some secret government thing. Well,

2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:21.360
 secret government things typically just don't come out and test to where there's unknowing

2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:27.200
 pilots. We can't control a lot of things. You're exactly right. So you go, you know, it's, you

2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:32.400
 know, it's not the Dr. Evil scientist that's going to throw shit out there to get, there's

2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:37.680
 reasons that we do it because a lot of stuff, especially when you get to, there's, there's,

2:50:37.680 --> 2:50:42.880
 you build something in theory, you model it, you go, hey, this is, it looks like it's going to work,

2:50:42.880 --> 2:50:49.120
 you get funding, you build it, you test it some more, you bench test it, you know, you, like an

2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:53.200
 airplane with digital flight controls before it even leaves the ground, they've got things over

2:50:53.200 --> 2:50:57.920
 the pedostatic system that are changing the, what the airplane thinks is the airspeed talking to it,

2:50:57.920 --> 2:51:02.960
 and it's probably up on jacks so the gear up. So it doesn't, it thinks it's flying. It doesn't know.

2:51:02.960 --> 2:51:06.880
 It's sitting on jack stands and they're just changing the pressure on the pedostatic system

2:51:06.880 --> 2:51:10.720
 so they can actually make the flight controls move and they can get all the data back to go,

2:51:10.720 --> 2:51:14.400
 hey, it looks like it's going to work. And then there's wind, there's a bunch of stuff that they

2:51:14.400 --> 2:51:18.560
 do. That's a control environment which you can do the testing. Yeah. Throwing shit out in the middle

2:51:18.560 --> 2:51:26.000
 of where people are doing exercises is the most preposterous thing that I've heard. Is it possible?

2:51:26.720 --> 2:51:33.280
 Yes. Is it more really, is it, is it, is it, it's more likely, it's more likely they're not doing

2:51:33.280 --> 2:51:38.960
 that. Yeah. Then the other, the other side of that question is why do you think people on the

2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:44.880
 Nimitz and in the US government in general not freak out more at the incredible thing that you've

2:51:44.880 --> 2:51:49.840
 seen? Freak out in the positive way, freak out in the negative way. Like what are the Russians

2:51:49.840 --> 2:51:58.320
 up to again? Or, or more like what is this? Like more turmoil. So if you were to put a Chinese flag

2:51:58.320 --> 2:52:01.680
 on the side of it or a Russian flag on the side of it and I said, yeah, it had a big Russian flag

2:52:01.680 --> 2:52:06.080
 on the side of it, dude, then it would have got a lot of attention. It would have went high order.

2:52:06.080 --> 2:52:10.320
 Yeah. Right. If it was, you don't have to say Russia or China. Just say, if there was another

2:52:10.320 --> 2:52:15.920
 country's emblem on the side of this thing that we saw and said, oh, it belonged to them, then

2:52:15.920 --> 2:52:20.400
 it's a big deal. So here's what's going on. So we're literally in the middle of workups and it

2:52:20.400 --> 2:52:24.160
 was a joint workup. Normally they, we go out for a month, go come back, do stuff, go out for a month.

2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:27.920
 This was a two month at sea period where we actually had to beg for them to let us when the

2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:31.520
 ship pulled in at Thanksgiving so we could run home up to the Central Valley, have Thanksgiving

2:52:31.520 --> 2:52:37.840
 with our family and then run back down and do this. Okay. So, you know, and I had just taken over,

2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:44.720
 I had had the squadron for a month. Right. So I'm a brand new CEO. I'm the most junior guy on the,

2:52:44.720 --> 2:52:49.280
 as far as a commanding officer goes for time in the Navy. And actually at the time,

2:52:49.280 --> 2:52:55.120
 I think it was the most junior CEO for O5 command in the Navy. Right. So you go, okay,

2:52:55.120 --> 2:53:00.480
 so I'm out here. I got my squadron. I'm running it. I see this thing. You know, we catch shit for it.

2:53:00.480 --> 2:53:05.440
 I have a squadron to run. I have the, the, the, the tic tac was over here. And although an extra

2:53:05.440 --> 2:53:13.520
 ordinary event, I have 17 aircrew and 300 sailors that I'm responsible for. Right. Their wellbeing,

2:53:13.520 --> 2:53:17.760
 making sure they're fed, making sure they're happy, they're birthing, you know, and I'm working with

2:53:17.760 --> 2:53:23.040
 my master chief and I'm working with my exo snap. And, and we're going through all this stuff.

2:53:23.680 --> 2:53:29.360
 I don't have a lot of time to worry about the tic tac. Yeah. If people need to talk to me,

2:53:29.360 --> 2:53:33.600
 so you got to remember, you got the captain of the ship, you got the airplane commander,

2:53:33.600 --> 2:53:38.480
 and you got the admiral, those are the top three. And you got the CEO of the, the Princeton, who is

2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:42.480
 a major command guy. And that's really your big major command. And then everything else is you

2:53:42.480 --> 2:53:46.080
 got all the squadrons, which are O5 command, and you got the small boys that are out there,

2:53:46.080 --> 2:53:51.280
 which is O5 command. So in the hierarchy, as far as rank and responsibility of what's going on,

2:53:52.160 --> 2:53:56.880
 I'm pretty much in the top 20 with all my peers. And then I've got obviously the captain,

2:53:57.680 --> 2:54:01.920
 in the admiral, right. And then he's got some post command guys on his staff that we were

2:54:01.920 --> 2:54:07.520
 friends with. You're responsible for a lot of things. Yes. Oh yeah. This schedule. Yeah.

2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:13.600
 There's missions. You have to do a lot, get the job done. And there's no time for silly things.

2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:18.400
 That's exactly right. So, and we're the, we're the integration, you know, when a, when a battle

2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:23.120
 group deploys, especially when you go to the Middle East for what we were doing, the air power is

2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:28.160
 the key. It's we take our airport with us, we can park it anywhere we want, and we can do what we

2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:32.960
 need to do. So we're kind of key players. So when you get the theory that, oh, all these men in

2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:36.880
 suits showed up. So the captain of the ship never said anything to me, the admiral never saying

2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:40.640
 to me, the people on his staff that I was friends with never saying to me, the other COs that I

2:54:40.640 --> 2:54:44.320
 talked to you on a daily basis never said anything to me. And no one ever came and talked to me,

2:54:44.320 --> 2:54:48.400
 and I'm the guy that chased it. So in all the theories and all the debunkers and all the stories,

2:54:48.400 --> 2:54:50.960
 because I don't know if people think they're going to get rich on this, because I made a big

2:54:50.960 --> 2:54:55.360
 donut on this. I can tell you what I got paid for. I got paid to go out and spend 21 hours of my day

2:54:55.360 --> 2:54:59.360
 going to LA and do a five minute talk for someone. And I'm like, and it wasn't for the talk because

2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:04.160
 I'll talk for free because you're not paying me. I said, I said, and then I got paid to go to the

2:55:04.160 --> 2:55:08.960
 McMinnville Fest because they, my wife and I got to go because it was just look like fun because

2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:13.280
 the whole town gets involved. And it's the only time I've ever spoken publicly in front of a

2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:17.200
 large audience about this because it was just, you know, it was fun. And I got asked and Jeremy

2:55:17.200 --> 2:55:22.080
 and George Nappen went the year before. So I went with Bob Lazar. So I got to hang out with Bob and

2:55:22.080 --> 2:55:26.880
 his wife and his wife and my wife. And, you know, we all hung out kind of, you know, talking not

2:55:26.880 --> 2:55:31.600
 about UFO stuff, but just getting to know each other as people because, you know, Bob's like me,

2:55:32.480 --> 2:55:35.920
 the stuff that he talks about is not the center of his life. If anything, it ruined his life.

2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:41.760
 Yeah. You know, he's just a really, really smart guy that's just like the rest of us trying to get

2:55:41.760 --> 2:55:46.480
 through life. Yeah. That's nevertheless, I mean, that was one of the sad things reading

2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:56.160
 Louis Elizondo's resignation note from his, he was a program director at the ATIP program.

2:55:58.960 --> 2:56:05.120
 One of the sad things is that he mentioned that, you know, people in government just don't take

2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:11.600
 this seriously as a threat, like UFOs as a threat. Like you said, if it doesn't have a Russian label

2:56:11.600 --> 2:56:18.720
 on it, it's a, it's a sad thing to think about that, that we have such a busy schedule that the

2:56:18.720 --> 2:56:26.080
 anomaly, it doesn't, is a distraction that we don't want to deal with. And it kind of just

2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:33.360
 fades into history. Like literally, it's kind of sad to think that if aliens showed up,

2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:43.760
 like, and it just didn't, because they're not like, when aliens show up, they're not going to

2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:50.640
 be a thing that's on the schedule. And if they don't start killing people, they just kind of show up

2:56:50.640 --> 2:57:00.160
 in some very nonchalant, peaceful way, briefly, people would be like, that's, that's, that's,

2:57:00.160 --> 2:57:04.000
 I don't have time for this. That's so sad. That's so sad.

2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:08.960
 It's like anywhere in the world. So, you know, go back, let's go back way back,

2:57:08.960 --> 2:57:13.520
 way back in the time machine, you know, there were people kind of scattered around the globe,

2:57:13.520 --> 2:57:20.080
 you know, in Europe's a perfect example. Why does France speak French? And then right next to them,

2:57:20.080 --> 2:57:25.200
 Spanish, you know, Spain speaks Spanish, and then you'd kind of jump over in Germans or German and

2:57:25.840 --> 2:57:29.120
 the Polish people, everyone speaks a different language, because if you look at the way the

2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:34.720
 train kind of subdivided the original people that were there, you know, thousands of years ago,

2:57:34.720 --> 2:57:39.920
 they speak differently, right? You'd be like the US, but see, the US is different. We all speak

2:57:39.920 --> 2:57:44.320
 English, because what happened? We came over and we started on the East Coast, and we migrated

2:57:44.320 --> 2:57:48.480
 West. We won't get into the, you know, what happened. And, you know, because the Native Americans

2:57:48.480 --> 2:57:53.440
 all spoke different languages. You know, it's that same type of thing. So, but anytime we have a

2:57:53.440 --> 2:57:58.000
 tendency to show up, you're, you're actually, you think about, you're an alien. If I go to a

2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:03.200
 different area, if I just, you know, go back 500 years where, you know, or a thousand years where

2:58:03.200 --> 2:58:06.800
 travel, we weren't traveling across oceans at the time. We're, well, we don't think we were. The

2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:12.000
 Vikings probably were, because we had limited, you know, we had to have supplies and the boats

2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:15.040
 weren't as big. We had to build them by hand. We didn't have power tools and all that stuff. So,

2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:20.080
 you know, if you show up someplace, like when the conquistadors from Spain came over into South

2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:25.520
 America and you've got, you know, the natives, you're actually an alien, you know, and then you

2:58:25.520 --> 2:58:30.960
 look at what typically happens when aliens show up in, in a human alien world, you know, and when

2:58:30.960 --> 2:58:38.800
 I say alien, I mean, you are not from that area. The other, we, we take what we want. And that's

2:58:38.800 --> 2:58:44.800
 what happened. I mean, we literally defuncted civilizations because that's how we are. You

2:58:44.800 --> 2:58:51.200
 know, humans are, we're an interesting group. So, you go, now what, what if something is from

2:58:51.200 --> 2:58:56.000
 someplace else? Just, let's just, let's just go off the grid and go ask, let's say there are

2:58:56.000 --> 2:58:59.840
 little green men. What are their intent? Guy, Lou asked me this when we were talking to Lou

2:58:59.840 --> 2:59:03.680
 Elizondo and he said, what do you think they were here for? I said, I don't know. He goes, what,

2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:07.200
 I go, oh, they were observing. They'd come down, they'd hang out and he goes, well, what if they

2:59:07.200 --> 2:59:12.000
 were prepping the battlefield? What if they were observing to figure out what we do? And you go,

2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:16.240
 that's interesting. The other theory is maybe there's a more advanced civilization out here and

2:59:16.240 --> 2:59:21.440
 they just check in on us because the threat to an advanced civilization is when a civilization

2:59:21.440 --> 2:59:26.720
 that's inferior to them actually develops enough and fast enough to become equal or above,

2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:31.200
 because now these, they become the threatened type. So, you watch us grow until we start getting too

2:59:31.200 --> 2:59:34.560
 much. You know, it's kind of like you go, well, because they always have a tendency to hang out

2:59:34.560 --> 2:59:38.720
 around nuclear, right? And you go, well, you know, they're, if this is an advanced civilization,

2:59:38.720 --> 2:59:42.160
 I'm going to go science fiction kind of comical. They come down and watch us and go, look at the,

2:59:42.160 --> 2:59:47.520
 the crazy upright monkeys now have developed the atom bomb. Let's hope they don't destroy

2:59:47.520 --> 2:59:51.840
 themselves. Yeah. If I was an alien civilization, I would start paying attention with the atom bomb.

2:59:51.840 --> 2:59:59.520
 That's why the, I mean, there's certainly an uptick of what is it, UFO sightings since,

3:00:00.480 --> 3:00:08.880
 since the nuclear. Since the nuclear. Yeah. That's, you go, hmm. Let me ask a little bit

3:00:08.880 --> 3:00:16.480
 out there question. Maybe it's speculation, but maybe touching on Roswell. Do you think it's

3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:29.120
 possible that there is out of this world aircraft or beings that are in the possession of one of

3:00:29.120 --> 3:00:35.440
 the governments on this earth, like the US government? Is it possible? So the one perspective

3:00:35.440 --> 3:00:41.920
 of that, if it's possible, is it possible to keep a secret like that? I would say this,

3:00:41.920 --> 3:00:46.640
 I think it's very, it's highly possible. Because if you go, if you just look at all the sightings

3:00:46.640 --> 3:00:50.560
 and let's go, just look at Project Bluebook, go, it was what, you have to forget how many

3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:54.640
 thousands of sightings and there's a percentage, it's like 10 or 15% of them, they still can't

3:00:54.640 --> 3:00:58.080
 explain. Like our tic tac is one of them. The, you know, they basically, the government has

3:00:58.080 --> 3:01:03.200
 come out and said, we don't know what that was. Okay. So, so if you go, okay, of that 15% that

3:01:03.200 --> 3:01:07.520
 we don't know and all these thousands are still that 15% makes up a pretty big number,

3:01:07.520 --> 3:01:12.800
 what are the chances that not one of them crashed somewhere on the globe and was recovered?

3:01:13.520 --> 3:01:19.200
 And I don't care if it's an intact system or you got pieces of it of a metal that we can't explain

3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:28.320
 or some, some biological matter, to say the least. It could be intact or it couldn't, but

3:01:28.320 --> 3:01:32.640
 the, the odds of that now are starting to go down that, you know, that could never happen. And I'm

3:01:32.640 --> 3:01:37.200
 not talking just the United States. I'm talking the globally. So is there a chance that a foreign

3:01:37.200 --> 3:01:41.680
 government actually possesses or our government or someone in the, in the world on the globe of

3:01:41.680 --> 3:01:47.040
 the seven plus billion people has something that is not from this world. And I'm not talking

3:01:47.040 --> 3:01:53.680
 to meteor, but something that was manufactured in some way that allowed transport or observation.

3:01:53.680 --> 3:01:57.280
 Could be a drone, could be a foreign drone, you know, like Voyager flies around and does all

3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:02.320
 that stuff. And we got stuff that just went past Pluto that's out in the Kuiper Belt. You know,

3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:05.520
 there's, there's stuff out there floating around. And what about ours? It's going to crash into

3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:11.360
 Jupiter eventually or whatever, because we've had stuff crash into planets. So if that's the case,

3:02:11.360 --> 3:02:15.040
 you would think something is out there that we have something that we can't explain. And,

3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:20.160
 and according to Lou, there's stuff that we can't explain. You know, and I would assume that Lou,

3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:26.320
 who ran ATIP has, has seen stuff that he can't openly talk about because, you know, because I

3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:30.880
 had a clearance. When you have a clearance, you were, you sign your name, you're bound to that.

3:02:30.880 --> 3:02:35.440
 And to me, that's an important oath that you hold to, you know, and this is kind of where,

3:02:36.480 --> 3:02:41.680
 you know, people have issues with Bob. So if, you know, and I leave it to you to determine if you

3:02:41.680 --> 3:02:46.960
 believe Bob or not, I'll tell you, Bob is a straightforward, very sane, normal, super smart

3:02:46.960 --> 3:02:51.680
 guy. Bob was our, yeah. Yes. There is the other side that says, well, should he have come out

3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:56.720
 and talked, you know, to those who will clearance who, you know, are true to the government, you

3:02:56.720 --> 3:03:01.840
 would say he should have never spoke. He, he was under an oath to not say anything, but he did.

3:03:02.480 --> 3:03:08.000
 If you ask Bob, why did you say something? His, his answer was, I understand there's an oath,

3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:13.200
 but I felt that the technology could benefit all of mankind and it shouldn't be locked away.

3:03:13.760 --> 3:03:16.560
 And I'll leave it, if you believe Bob, that's, that's kind of what Bob says.

3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:24.480
 And that, that's such a interesting key point. If there is aircraft, a technology that's in the

3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:31.440
 possession of the, say the US government, should they make that publicly known? This is this note

3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:37.280
 in question. This is the question of like, do we release stuff that can potentially change the

3:03:37.280 --> 3:03:44.720
 nature of human civilization? Like the, the way we, the way we think about our place in the world,

3:03:44.720 --> 3:03:53.360
 also the, if that technology is potentially useful for military applications, the nature of

3:03:53.360 --> 3:03:58.320
 military conflict, should we release that information or not? If you were the government?

3:03:58.320 --> 3:04:03.360
 So here, well, here's exactly how. So for, for classified information, the government is the

3:04:03.360 --> 3:04:09.200
 people that classify it. So I can't go, I can't look at something and go, oh my God, this avion

3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:12.720
 bottle is now top secret. I can't, I don't have the authority, the ability or anyone to do that.

3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:16.160
 That, that's up to the government. And I agree with that because I worked for the government

3:04:16.160 --> 3:04:24.800
 for 24 years in my life. So I understand that. But now you go, there's reason stuff is classified.

3:04:24.800 --> 3:04:30.400
 Okay. And it has to do with, sometimes information is classified by how it was obtained.

3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:36.080
 It's just like the mob. If I have a spy and I'm a mobster and you're the counter mobster,

3:04:36.080 --> 3:04:40.640
 but I have a guy on the inside that's feeding me information, I can't do it. And a perfect example

3:04:40.640 --> 3:04:45.360
 is if you've ever seen the, it's the Tom Cruise movie, what is it, Air America or whatever,

3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:50.720
 but he, he plays the guy in Louisiana who was hauling drugs for Pablo Escobar. And he ended

3:04:50.720 --> 3:04:55.200
 up getting a cargo plane and the government, the CIA was kind of funding him to do stuff.

3:04:55.760 --> 3:04:58.800
 That's how he got hooked up with Pablo, but they put cameras on his airplane. And when

3:04:58.800 --> 3:05:02.960
 Reagan had come out and said, here's pictures, we have proof that they're running these drugs,

3:05:02.960 --> 3:05:06.480
 it didn't take Pablo long to figure out those pictures were taken from inside of the plane

3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:10.240
 of this guy he had been working with. And that guy ends up dead. Does that make sense?

3:05:10.240 --> 3:05:15.440
 So you classify to protect the source, you classify to protect the technology,

3:05:15.440 --> 3:05:19.760
 because if the technology would get out, it could be grave damage or there's levels,

3:05:19.760 --> 3:05:23.680
 depending on if it's a secret or top secret. There are levels of damage that can be done

3:05:23.680 --> 3:05:28.160
 to the US government and our well being as a country. And we owe it to this because we're

3:05:28.160 --> 3:05:32.880
 all Americans. You know, to me, no matter what some people will say, even into this country,

3:05:32.880 --> 3:05:36.800
 this is the greatest country on the planet. This is the only country that you have the

3:05:36.800 --> 3:05:41.040
 ability to do what you want to do. It's just don't be lazy. And I have stories of people

3:05:41.040 --> 3:05:47.280
 that came over here and started with nothing. And they're, they're living the American dream.

3:05:47.280 --> 3:05:52.720
 And they'll tell you, and they didn't get it because of, you know, like you, you came over here

3:05:52.720 --> 3:05:58.960
 from Russia, you get no minority status or anything else, you get, you're a white,

3:05:58.960 --> 3:06:04.720
 Anglo Saxton Protestant, whatever your religion, but you come over here. I kind of knew that from

3:06:04.720 --> 3:06:11.680
 the last one. But you come over here, you basically have made yourself. You're educated,

3:06:11.680 --> 3:06:16.720
 you're working at literally the top research university in the world, to be honest.

3:06:17.600 --> 3:06:23.360
 I can do whatever the hell I can create with a bit of, with a lot of hard work, I can do quite

3:06:23.920 --> 3:06:32.000
 And no one gave it to you. So I mean, and I, I'm a believer that like, I mean, we are a community.

3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:38.160
 So like, there is a social aspect to it, but the freedom and the American dream is a real thing.

3:06:38.160 --> 3:06:44.160
 And this is this, I, you know, I joke about being Russian, but I, I'm an American and this is,

3:06:44.160 --> 3:06:49.040
 I do believe the greatest country on earth. So there's a reason the nationalist pride,

3:06:50.400 --> 3:06:57.840
 the pride in your nation is a powerful thing. And around that, this secrecy holds value.

3:06:57.840 --> 3:07:07.600
 But to me, alien technology is bigger than that. I mean, it's, it's not so much a threat as a,

3:07:08.240 --> 3:07:14.880
 you're holding back something that could inspire the world, like a human knowledge.

3:07:14.880 --> 3:07:19.200
 So let's talk in theory. So I'm going to go back to Bob, because I've talked to Bob.

3:07:19.200 --> 3:07:27.120
 So Bob is a propulsion guy. Right. Right. Bob has a bicycle with a rocket motor. He built the rocket car,

3:07:27.760 --> 3:07:31.840
 you know, so he did that. So if you are trying to figure out a propulsion system,

3:07:33.200 --> 3:07:39.680
 let's just say this is, I'm just talking, this is Dave's theory. I am, I own, I have,

3:07:39.680 --> 3:07:45.120
 I have custody of this thing from a technology that I don't understand. And I know it's a

3:07:45.120 --> 3:07:50.240
 propulsion system. So now I got to figure it out. Right. So who are you going to go to?

3:07:51.040 --> 3:07:56.160
 Right. You go find someone. So you go, wait, here's a guy who at the time was working at

3:07:56.160 --> 3:08:01.120
 Los Alamos, which they have proven, who is big into propulsion. He designs all this. He builds a

3:08:01.120 --> 3:08:07.520
 shit in his garage. Hey, he's super smart. Why don't we bring him in? So you hire him on a

3:08:07.520 --> 3:08:10.560
 contract and you go, Hey, we're going to brief you into a program and he goes and works on

3:08:10.560 --> 3:08:14.080
 wherever he says he worked. You know, that's not important, but you get access to the technology

3:08:14.080 --> 3:08:18.400
 to try and figure it out. And then you go, well, you know, Bob comes out and says, you know,

3:08:18.400 --> 3:08:22.240
 I, we're figuring out these things, but there's a part where our technology isn't advanced enough

3:08:22.240 --> 3:08:27.760
 for us to figure the whole thing out. So then, you know, and let's just say Bob doesn't come out

3:08:27.760 --> 3:08:33.680
 and tell anyone, he works on it until he gets to the point where he's stagnated. He's at a,

3:08:33.680 --> 3:08:36.800
 he's at a wall. You go, I can't do it. So sometimes the best thing is to bring in a

3:08:36.800 --> 3:08:40.080
 fresh mind. So you go find someone else who's in a propulsion, you bring him in, they work,

3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:43.840
 they can't figure it out, or they get to the point where kind of back to the Einstein theory

3:08:43.840 --> 3:08:46.880
 where, Hey, I've got all these theories on how it works, but we don't have the technology. We

3:08:46.880 --> 3:08:50.480
 haven't advanced enough to actually do what we need to do. We still have to advance technology

3:08:50.480 --> 3:08:55.440
 more. So then what do you do? You shelf it. You go, Hey, good projects over and the contract,

3:08:55.440 --> 3:09:01.040
 you shelf it, and you wait another 10 years. And you wait another 10 years until technology and

3:09:01.040 --> 3:09:06.000
 our abilities and our research advances more. And then you go find new people to bring in that

3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:09.200
 are experts in that field and go, Hey, we want you to work on this thing. And here's what we

3:09:09.200 --> 3:09:14.720
 know about it so far. Or you don't tell them anything. Cause you, cause remember, if you were,

3:09:14.720 --> 3:09:18.320
 if you reveal someone else's research, you can taint their beliefs, they'll start to sway in

3:09:18.320 --> 3:09:21.840
 that direction. So you go, I'm not going to tell you anything. I'm going to give you this thing.

3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:25.920
 And now you tell me what you think. And as they progress, if they get stuck on a problem that

3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:29.120
 may be Bob and someone else solved earlier, you can go, Hey, what about this? You don't have to

3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:32.720
 tell them where it came from. What about this? And now they can leapfrog and they get another

3:09:32.720 --> 3:09:38.240
 two steps closer to the final answer. And then we get stuck by our evolution of technology.

3:09:38.240 --> 3:09:42.560
 Do you shelve it again? Do you think that's the right way to do it? Because it's heartbreaking.

3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:50.880
 Listen, I love government, but we just had this discussion about Elon and so on. The alternative

3:09:50.880 --> 3:09:58.080
 approach is to release this to the world and say there's a mystery here. And then the Elon's of

3:09:58.080 --> 3:10:02.080
 the world that Jeff Bezos, we talked about money, but it's also not just money. It's like

3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:09.120
 this engine that's within, we talked about the American dream to say, I'm going to be the one

3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:15.840
 that cracks this mystery open. And like that's within a lot of us. And like money aside, people

3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:20.960
 in their garage just will. But you're thinking like a scientist. Now let me shift to, let me

3:10:20.960 --> 3:10:26.400
 think like a country. So we have country A, B and C. And you can look at the nuclear arms race. So

3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:31.840
 we know that Germany was really close. We know that Russia was getting pretty close. We just won

3:10:31.840 --> 3:10:36.640
 the race and we were the first ones with it. And still to this day. And Germany could have won.

3:10:36.640 --> 3:10:41.280
 They could have won. They could have won, but someone was smart enough to not finish the equation

3:10:41.280 --> 3:10:45.520
 when they knew they had the answer is literally what it comes down to. Someone was smart enough

3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:52.000
 to realize that that got into the hands of the Nazis, that it would be the end. And that's

3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:57.120
 a tough call to do that knowing that you have the answer and you can't solve the problem because

3:10:57.120 --> 3:10:59.840
 it will go into the wrong hand. And that's kind of the fear when you look at this, you go,

3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:06.720
 okay, so if we do this, if we put it out there, we've got this technology. If we don't work on it,

3:11:06.720 --> 3:11:09.760
 kind of international space station, like we're all going to work on it together,

3:11:10.400 --> 3:11:15.840
 you know, like Antarctica is really supposed to be treaty free for many weapons or anything

3:11:15.840 --> 3:11:19.280
 more. We've got the international thing down there. We're all going to work together. If you

3:11:19.280 --> 3:11:24.800
 did it in the confines of that and you could control the flow in and out, because what you

3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:28.480
 don't want is the someone stealing information and getting it back to where, and countries

3:11:28.480 --> 3:11:32.080
 are notorious to do this. Hey, we're doing it internationally, but we're secretly doing it

3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:37.200
 ourselves to see who can come up with the solution first. That's the problem, because we have this

3:11:37.200 --> 3:11:43.600
 inherent thing of power and technology like that is power. It would literally change the game of the

3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:49.520
 way the world operates. And from not just a transportation or mankind, but from a military

3:11:49.520 --> 3:11:59.120
 aspect, it's got huge, huge. Yeah, so beautifully presented. And I feel like there's a tension

3:11:59.120 --> 3:12:04.400
 between those two places, the scientists view of the world and the national security view of the

3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:12.320
 world. Let me get to this kind of interesting point, which is a lot of conspiracy theorists kind

3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:17.920
 of paint a picture of government as an exceptionally, as a hierarchical system that's exceptionally

3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:24.720
 competent and good at hiding secrets. And then, I mean, I tend to not subscribe to almost any

3:12:24.720 --> 3:12:33.600
 conspiracy theory to the degree at least that the conspiracy theorists do, but there does seem to be,

3:12:33.600 --> 3:12:39.840
 and I tend to think of government as unfortunately incompetent, at least the bureaucracy,

3:12:41.120 --> 3:12:46.000
 it seems that the communication like the three videos that were released and just the way

3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:54.400
 of DOD in general talks about the things we've been talking about, it's just confused. There's

3:12:54.400 --> 3:13:02.240
 contradictory. It's not inspiring. It's, it's suspicious. It's just not even the way they

3:13:02.240 --> 3:13:08.880
 released the videos, you know, the tic tac, if presented correctly, could just inspire a generation

3:13:08.880 --> 3:13:17.280
 of scientists. It's like, you know, us going to the moon, it's inspiring. I mean, it's incredible,

3:13:18.320 --> 3:13:23.680
 and the way it was released, it was suspicious. It was like low resolution video on a crappy website,

3:13:24.640 --> 3:13:31.760
 like with some crappy documents. And I mean, why, I don't know how to ask this question, but can

3:13:31.760 --> 3:13:37.280
 government do better? Why are they doing it this way in terms of communicating the things they do

3:13:37.280 --> 3:13:42.240
 know to the public? Because I don't think they know how. Especially in this topic, it's been

3:13:42.240 --> 3:13:47.600
 hidden for so many years. And I don't think, because I don't buy off on the conspiracy stuff,

3:13:48.160 --> 3:13:51.760
 I just think that, you know, when it comes in, like I said, you know, the government has a right

3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:56.720
 to classify stuff, they classify everything because they don't know. You have something,

3:13:56.720 --> 3:14:00.560
 you don't know what it is, you don't know. So we just go, well, it must be top secret,

3:14:00.560 --> 3:14:03.840
 and let's put it in a vault. You know, it's kind of like the Indiana Jones where they take the

3:14:03.840 --> 3:14:09.120
 Ark and they put it in the, it's in the giant army warehouse. You know, we don't even know what we

3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:15.840
 have. So, but I also believe that, you know, and I'll say this openly, I don't think that the American

3:14:15.840 --> 3:14:20.480
 people need to know everything. I think there's a reason that stuff is classified for the protection

3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:27.600
 of this country. And I totally believe in that. So, you know, I was joking with Joe when he was

3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:32.880
 talking about the Storm Area 51 stuff. Yeah, that's probably the worst idea you could possibly have

3:14:32.880 --> 3:14:38.400
 is to just storm a military installation. It's just stupid. There are reasons, there are reasons

3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:43.760
 that we have things that we don't just let out to the public because if we do, as soon as you do,

3:14:43.760 --> 3:14:48.800
 let someone know that you have something, they immediately try to counter it. And perfect example,

3:14:50.160 --> 3:14:56.000
 the US in the 60s developed a bomber. It was a Mach 3 compression lift bomber called the XB70.

3:14:56.560 --> 3:15:02.240
 Okay, there was three of them built, three of them ever built. It was a like 60,000 foot high,

3:15:02.240 --> 3:15:06.080
 you know, Mach 3, maybe it was an incredible airplane when you see it. And there's actually

3:15:06.080 --> 3:15:10.000
 the last one remaining is in Dayton, Ohio at the museum. You know, it would go, the wingtips

3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:16.400
 would fold on, it looks like a Concorde, but it's way faster. When that got out that we were

3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:22.960
 developing it, the Soviet Union developed the MiG 25, literally a high altitude interceptor to

3:15:22.960 --> 3:15:32.560
 counter that bomber. And they built an entire fleet of MiG 25s, right? We built three XB70s

3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:38.800
 and we scrapped the program, right? Because now you go, well, it's, the technology is cool, we

3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:42.000
 proved it, but now it becomes obsolete. So it's not even worth building a whole fleet of these

3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:46.320
 things. You know, it's constant, it's a chess game. We do something, they do something, we do

3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:49.520
 something, they do something, and it's, we do something, and then they counter it. They got

3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:53.920
 to, it's, you got to figure out how to defeat it. So you go, oh, we'll build something. So the more

3:15:53.920 --> 3:15:59.760
 we keep quiet, especially from a defense standpoint, the better. We actually, I personally, I think we

3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:04.960
 talk too much. And I think the military and the DoD is starting to see that, you know, we're too

3:16:04.960 --> 3:16:09.600
 open, you know, you announce, hey, we're building this because there's a budget line and we live

3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:16.720
 in a free society. But you don't have to release all the specs. And you don't have to put everything

3:16:16.720 --> 3:16:22.560
 in open source. But that's a problem when we go to the universities. If we want to go do work with

3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:26.640
 MIT, and you want to partner with MIT and your defense company, and you want to partner, you

3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:30.880
 know, you guys have a rule that if you create it, then it can be open source because the university

3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:36.320
 owns it. And we are an institution of learning, where the defense side might go, we don't, we

3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:39.360
 don't really want that published in a paper in Scientific America.

3:16:39.360 --> 3:16:46.960
 It's so hard to break it. I talked to CTO of Lockheed, Kiko Jackson, and just, just concords. The

3:16:46.960 --> 3:16:54.320
 some of the best, if not the best engineering and science, but engineering really ever is done

3:16:55.040 --> 3:17:00.880
 in secrecy. And it sucks, because it's so inspiring, and they can't talk about it.

3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:04.720
 It is, but some of it's due to funding. The US government has deep pockets.

3:17:05.440 --> 3:17:08.720
 You know, some of this new technology that you developed for an open source and lesson,

3:17:08.720 --> 3:17:13.600
 this goes back to the original conversation. We now, there's enough money in the private sector

3:17:13.600 --> 3:17:20.480
 that individuals control. Bezos, I'm not talking Amazon. I'm talking Jeff Bezos.

3:17:20.480 --> 3:17:21.280
 It's single individual.

3:17:21.280 --> 3:17:25.920
 It's worth over $100 billion. He has the ability to do stuff. I'll tell you what,

3:17:25.920 --> 3:17:32.160
 the Gates Foundation, with between Bill Gates and his wife and Warren Buffett and some of the

3:17:32.160 --> 3:17:38.240
 other money, because I think Bezos's ex wife actually donated a huge chunk of her half into

3:17:38.240 --> 3:17:42.080
 the Gates Foundation. So, I mean, what's the Gates Foundation worth these days?

3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:46.800
 You know, if, and these are guys, you know, brilliant, brilliant. I mean, some of the

3:17:46.800 --> 3:17:50.320
 greatest minds that we have to go, what are they doing? Because they have the ability,

3:17:50.320 --> 3:17:53.600
 it's a nonprofit. They can go, hey, I want to fund this. I want to fund this research.

3:17:53.600 --> 3:17:55.840
 They can look beyond the conflict between nations.

3:17:55.840 --> 3:17:59.920
 You can look beyond the conflict of having to have, you know, classification. You could do

3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:06.240
 what you want. You know, it's just like, you know, we classify how to do, you know, the whole

3:18:06.240 --> 3:18:12.080
 nuclear, you know, how to create a critical mass, right? But there's really smart high school kids

3:18:12.080 --> 3:18:15.040
 that have figured it out mathematically and they do their science projects and then the government

3:18:15.040 --> 3:18:17.920
 comes in and says, hey, we got to classify your government because we just don't want this out

3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:22.640
 in the public domain, which I understand. But they never stopped them from free thought and

3:18:22.640 --> 3:18:27.600
 developing that. It's just, we really don't want this out there. Okay, so I understand that.

3:18:27.600 --> 3:18:32.320
 I totally understand that. But if they, you know, if Bill and Melinda want to do this and go, hey,

3:18:32.320 --> 3:18:35.440
 we want to do this and they're going to work with Bezos and they're going to work with Elon and we're

3:18:35.440 --> 3:18:40.400
 going to, you think about it, there's a significant amount of money that could be available to R&D

3:18:40.400 --> 3:18:44.160
 and I'm not talking just science like this. I'm talking medical research and all this.

3:18:44.720 --> 3:18:49.280
 But then you go, well, who gets it? Because now you're competing against the companies that actually

3:18:49.280 --> 3:18:55.200
 do it. And you go, is that, well, are they the greatest minds? I'd say, you know, we have a tendency

3:18:55.200 --> 3:19:00.480
 to go, these are the best that we have. And I'd say, well, no, that's the best that we know we have.

3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:03.840
 But there's probably people out there that don't want to work. There's brilliant minds that don't

3:19:03.840 --> 3:19:07.600
 want to do anything with the fence because they just disagree with what it does. So they go do

3:19:07.600 --> 3:19:12.960
 another path. They could do something else. And in the sense that the Elon's of the world that

3:19:12.960 --> 3:19:21.680
 Jeff Bezos actually, in a certain sense, much better than DOD at finding the brilliant weird

3:19:21.680 --> 3:19:25.920
 minds out there. Because they're not tied to the government. So when you work a government contract,

3:19:26.640 --> 3:19:30.880
 the government writes, they tell you what they want and then they work with you on the requirements

3:19:30.880 --> 3:19:35.680
 and they usually have an end in mean, you know, they have an idea that this is what I want it to be

3:19:36.560 --> 3:19:43.840
 where if you go to like SpaceX, where, you know, they come up with, why don't we just

3:19:43.840 --> 3:19:48.000
 land these things on a pad and reuse them? Yeah. Well, if the government scientists,

3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:51.040
 if you're on a government contract says, no, that's not the requirements, we're not paying for that,

3:19:51.040 --> 3:19:55.360
 we want you to do this, you're kind of controlled. Or when Elon does it, his company,

3:19:55.360 --> 3:19:59.360
 they can do whatever the hell they want to do because they have no bounds. The only bounds they

3:19:59.360 --> 3:20:02.960
 have is the liability if it doesn't work and it lands on something. So what do you do? You go out

3:20:02.960 --> 3:20:06.480
 to Quadrillion and you test it. And if it crashes and it lands in the ocean, hey, we cleaned it up,

3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:11.920
 no big deal, we lost some money, but we'll move on. It's, you know, money makes the world go

3:20:11.920 --> 3:20:15.600
 around contrary to what everyone thinks. But, you know, there's a lot of money that's sitting

3:20:15.600 --> 3:20:19.840
 around that you can do a lot of really cool stuff with. And I don't know. I mean, I'll guarantee

3:20:19.840 --> 3:20:25.520
 that, what is it, Blue Origin? Isn't that Amazon? You know, that they're doing some cool stuff because

3:20:25.520 --> 3:20:30.640
 they have funny. And I joke with the guy I know that worked at SpaceX and he was funny because

3:20:30.640 --> 3:20:37.600
 they were building the first test thing and they were limited and Elon found this like 400 acre

3:20:37.600 --> 3:20:43.440
 thing, I think it's about 400 acres down by Waco, Texas. And he's like, I go, how he goes, he goes,

3:20:43.440 --> 3:20:47.920
 dude, I worked, he goes, I worked with, he goes, because he's done government contract. He goes,

3:20:47.920 --> 3:20:51.680
 there's government contract and then there's working at SpaceX with Elon money. And that's

3:20:51.680 --> 3:20:55.840
 what he refers to it as is Elon money where it was like, don't I'll throw them and he would throw

3:20:55.840 --> 3:21:00.160
 the money at it and make it happen. And it's, I'm talking this fast. I mean, he talks about,

3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:03.680
 he has a great story about this. I mean, this is Elon, but this is how fast you can do in the

3:21:03.680 --> 3:21:08.880
 private sector vice the government where there's the bureaucracy is they had a company that was a,

3:21:08.880 --> 3:21:14.000
 basically a tool and dye machine shop that did a lot of their high precision parts for the rockets.

3:21:15.360 --> 3:21:19.360
 They had went to the guy, but he had contracts with other companies. And when the economy was down,

3:21:19.360 --> 3:21:23.920
 the guy was actually looking at going out of business. So the guy, I know, he's telling me the

3:21:23.920 --> 3:21:27.360
 story. He was talking to the guy, he had to go over there and get something. And he's like, holy

3:21:27.360 --> 3:21:32.000
 shit, he goes, hang on. So he calls up on the phone, SpaceX. He says, Hey, is Elon there?

3:21:32.000 --> 3:21:36.800
 Can you get him in the boardroom? We'll be there in 20 minutes. So he grabs this guy who's literally

3:21:36.800 --> 3:21:42.320
 going to fold his company. They go over to SpaceX and I may be getting some of this wrong if people

3:21:42.320 --> 3:21:47.360
 are going to fact check me, but this is pretty close. They go in the boardroom and he said literally

3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:54.080
 within like, you know, an hour or two, Elon has bought the guy's company. That guy is now a senior

3:21:54.080 --> 3:22:00.080
 VP running his company. And they're going to pull all the stuff into the SpaceX thing so they can

3:22:00.080 --> 3:22:04.960
 actually build the parts and they can still contract out to make the money outside. And it

3:22:04.960 --> 3:22:09.600
 happened like that fast. And it's not just money. It's because I've seen, I've witnessed it too

3:22:09.600 --> 3:22:17.600
 with Elon. I think it's whatever the, whatever the forces of capitalism that allow a person like

3:22:17.600 --> 3:22:23.520
 Elon Musk to rise to the top. But like, because I've also worked for DARPA, like for research,

3:22:23.520 --> 3:22:30.000
 for in terms of a source of funding, I, there's a weight of bureaucracy when I was working,

3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:34.480
 like being funded by DARPA. And with Elon, like I was literally in the presence of like

3:22:34.480 --> 3:22:40.960
 anything is possible, cutting across all the bullshit of paperwork of the way things were done

3:22:40.960 --> 3:22:46.720
 in the past of the bureaucracy, the rules, the constraints, the, all of that stuff, just you

3:22:46.720 --> 3:22:50.720
 can cut across immediately. How much money and time do you waste dealing with the bureaucracy

3:22:50.720 --> 3:22:55.360
 when you could actually be doing real work? That's the difference. This is why, honestly,

3:22:55.360 --> 3:23:00.240
 when I went back to the industrial defense complex that we were warned about, when you look at it

3:23:00.240 --> 3:23:05.040
 and go, SpaceX can do something for half the price ahead of schedule that would Boeing were

3:23:05.040 --> 3:23:10.720
 paying Boeing. And you go, Oh, well, this just came out. And you go, well, then why are we even

3:23:10.720 --> 3:23:15.520
 dealing with this side when we can deal with this side? Because you've got a fully automated capsule

3:23:15.520 --> 3:23:20.320
 that has a manual mode that they got to fly around in. It worked like a champ. It went up,

3:23:20.320 --> 3:23:26.400
 it hung out, it came back, it splashed down. It worked perfectly. You know, we're going to dust

3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:31.280
 it off. And oh, by the way, unlike the Apollo capsules that were used and put to museums,

3:23:32.240 --> 3:23:35.360
 they're going to reuse that dragon capsule. It came down, they're going to dust it off,

3:23:35.360 --> 3:23:40.320
 put a new coat of paint on it, slap it on top of another rocket and away it goes. Holy cow.

3:23:40.320 --> 3:23:44.400
 It's amazing. It's a shift. It's a complete shift in mentality. And for us as taxpayers,

3:23:44.400 --> 3:23:49.920
 we can explore at half the cost. Yeah. It's exciting, especially given putting the tic tac in

3:23:49.920 --> 3:23:57.360
 context, like then the sky or it's limitless the possibilities we could do with this kind of mechanism.

3:23:57.360 --> 3:24:00.000
 I think it's exciting. Yeah. Super exciting. I think we live in an exciting time right now,

3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:04.240
 besides everything that's messed up in the world right now. Well, this is a hopeful,

3:24:04.240 --> 3:24:09.840
 like there's so much conflict going on, so much tension. That's to me, space exploration at the

3:24:09.840 --> 3:24:16.400
 moment is a reason to get up in the morning and have a hope for the future to look up to the sky.

3:24:16.400 --> 3:24:22.000
 And we're humans. We can solve so many. We can solve all of this.

3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:24.320
 I was talking about when I was doing the Tucker thing and I said,

3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:28.880
 is this would be great? Because when the government had come out a month ago and said,

3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:33.040
 hey, this does exist. We're doing this. And oh, we're going to release more stuff.

3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:37.920
 And I was texting like Lou and Chris Mellon and those guys before I went on because they

3:24:37.920 --> 3:24:42.880
 had called me up to be on Tucker's show and I'm like, hey, I go, this would be great. Just come

3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:49.200
 out with this. Find the relic of a spaceship. Like pull out the Roswell wreckage if you have it.

3:24:49.200 --> 3:24:54.000
 Pull out the Roswell wreckage into it. God, it would be so nice to not have to deal with

3:24:54.800 --> 3:24:59.040
 the riots in the cities. And I mean, I know it's an election year and all that, but

3:24:59.040 --> 3:25:02.960
 God, it would be something, it would be refreshing to not have to turn on my TV and see

3:25:02.960 --> 3:25:07.280
 everything that is just depressing in the world. To begin with, holy cow, we actually do have this

3:25:07.280 --> 3:25:08.880
 and we're working on this technology.

3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:14.000
 They imagine if there is a Roswell aircraft and they pull it out, imagine the innovation

3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:18.080
 that happens in the next 10 to 20 years without any more information than that.

3:25:19.200 --> 3:25:22.640
 Just the, the innovation that happens, the look on, you know, Musk's face,

3:25:22.640 --> 3:25:25.600
 look on Jeff Bezos's face and all the brilliant engineers.

3:25:25.600 --> 3:25:28.320
 It would change the game. It would change the game completely.

3:25:28.320 --> 3:25:32.560
 Let me ask the big question. I apologize for the absurd romantic nature of it.

3:25:32.560 --> 3:25:40.000
 But outside, I mean, one of the things, the fact that you've laid your eyes on a UFO,

3:25:41.600 --> 3:25:45.200
 probably open your eyes to the possibility that some of the other sightings,

3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:50.480
 there, there could be other sightings that have legitimacy to them.

3:25:50.480 --> 3:25:55.920
 What do you, is the outside of your own sighting is the most interesting

3:25:56.880 --> 3:26:01.440
 sighting or UFO related event in history?

3:26:01.440 --> 3:26:02.640
 Oh, I think there's several.

3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:08.160
 What is it? Ramachan Forest in England, the U.S. guys that saw stuff and actually got

3:26:08.160 --> 3:26:12.400
 radiation burns. One guy was medically disabled, but they weren't going to give it.

3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:16.880
 And he had to help from Jim McCain. His office helped get the guys,

3:26:17.920 --> 3:26:20.800
 disability reestablished. I think that's a big one.

3:26:22.560 --> 3:26:25.920
 I think there's people out there that have seen stuff and I'm talking credible

3:26:26.640 --> 3:26:30.560
 because there's, you got to remember, there's a huge chunk of the sightings that get

3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:36.000
 disproven. They're actually explainable. You know, you had sent me the question,

3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:37.760
 the Phoenix lights.

3:26:37.760 --> 3:26:38.480
 Phoenix lights.

3:26:38.480 --> 3:26:39.440
 I think there's...

3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:42.080
 What's that? So I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with some of these.

3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:48.160
 I'm not either. You want a funny story on that. So I was at a conference and said,

3:26:48.160 --> 3:26:51.040
 hopefully he doesn't watch this and get offended. But we had this,

3:26:52.400 --> 3:26:57.280
 this, it was, I call it speed dating. So there was a table, about eight people at a table.

3:26:57.280 --> 3:27:00.160
 And we would go sit at the table and they could ask us questions and then after 10

3:27:00.160 --> 3:27:04.000
 minutes, we moved to the next table. So I was speed dating all these people that are really

3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:08.720
 into this. It was kind of funny, but I'd sat down and it's always funny because some people will

3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:12.560
 try and dominate it, but you know, you have to kind of push the dominators away so that,

3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:17.200
 you know, if you're quiet and introverted, you can ask your question too. So we got into this

3:27:17.200 --> 3:27:20.240
 and the guy starts naming all these, well, what about this? What about the Phoenix lights?

3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:23.040
 I'm like, I don't know about the Phoenix lights. What about this event? I don't know about that.

3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:28.240
 He goes, he looks at me and he goes, well, you're not a UFO guy. I go, no, I'm not,

3:27:28.240 --> 3:27:32.480
 but I chased one. So I'm an expert. Have you? And you could see him get deflated because I'm

3:27:32.480 --> 3:27:36.960
 kind of a smart ass like that. Yeah. I mean, the first hand experience from a credible,

3:27:36.960 --> 3:27:41.280
 in some sense, these sightings have to do both with the evidence and the human.

3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:46.320
 Well, I think part of that is to us, that that's a credibility piece because the four of us that

3:27:46.320 --> 3:27:50.560
 actually saw it plus, you know, the other two that were in the airplane that shot the video,

3:27:50.560 --> 3:27:56.720
 none of us are UFO obsessed people. So when we come out and say, because to me, it's just in,

3:27:56.720 --> 3:28:01.920
 it's five minutes of my life. I did a lot of really cool, I've had a really kind of neat

3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:12.080
 things I've been able to do. But when you look at it and go, we don't, to me, it wasn't, it's not

3:28:12.080 --> 3:28:17.840
 the pinnacle of my life. You know, to other people that they live in the UFO world and it's like they,

3:28:17.840 --> 3:28:21.040
 you know, if you talk to people, they'll go that are really into it, who've never seen one.

3:28:21.040 --> 3:28:28.800
 And it kills them that they didn't see one. When here we are because, and what's unique with ours,

3:28:28.800 --> 3:28:32.720
 which kind of adds that level is it wasn't, we just didn't see it. It wasn't like, oh,

3:28:32.720 --> 3:28:36.880
 look, something in the sky and it was weird. We actually engaged with it. You know, it was,

3:28:36.880 --> 3:28:41.360
 yeah, that was an engaged five minute thing. And there's other stories from other countries,

3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:46.640
 like there's a story in the back when the Soviet Union existed, that they actually

3:28:46.640 --> 3:28:50.960
 would chase these things and one of them shot at some, you know, it shot it because they said shoot

3:28:50.960 --> 3:28:54.960
 at it and it shot it and then it got shot down. And then they said, don't ever shoot at them again

3:28:54.960 --> 3:28:58.480
 and don't chase them. Just you can observe them, but don't go after them because obviously they

3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:02.960
 have firepower that we can't control because if you can make something float around and jam radars

3:29:02.960 --> 3:29:09.600
 at will and do whatever you want, you know, modern terrestrial weapons are probably not very useful.

3:29:09.600 --> 3:29:12.400
 You know, you can go to Independence Day, they had that force field around, oh, we got a,

3:29:12.400 --> 3:29:16.000
 we got it. Now you got a cyber warfare, you got to take the bug down, you got to take the warfare.

3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:20.080
 So now we can actually inhibit some type of damage. So there's a, I mean, you mentioned

3:29:20.080 --> 3:29:27.120
 the Phoenix lights. This is somebody on, I think Reddit said, ask him any thoughts on mass UFO

3:29:27.120 --> 3:29:31.920
 sightings like the Phoenix lights. So the interesting thing, like you said with the tic tac is that

3:29:31.920 --> 3:29:36.560
 multiple people laid their eyes on this. What are your thoughts about the Phoenix lights or

3:29:36.560 --> 3:29:41.360
 many people? So here's a deal with massive sightings. So the Phoenix lights is unexplainable,

3:29:41.360 --> 3:29:46.240
 although I know the Air Force had said something about it was an A10 drop and flares. I don't think so.

3:29:46.240 --> 3:29:50.720
 Flares don't burn that long. They just come out and they, you know, they detract and they go away.

3:29:51.360 --> 3:29:55.440
 Although on the other hand, there's, you know, because clouds can do things. So I lived in

3:29:55.440 --> 3:30:01.040
 Central California for 18 years and you would get, oh my God, what was that in the sky? And it was

3:30:01.040 --> 3:30:05.280
 really Vandenberg shooting a missile off. You know, they were doing ICBM tests at one time where they

3:30:05.280 --> 3:30:10.080
 shoot from Vandenberg and they fly across, then they go land in the atoll at Kwajalein, you know,

3:30:10.080 --> 3:30:13.680
 and then they can check the displacement, the accuracy and all that stuff, you know, stuff

3:30:13.680 --> 3:30:18.480
 that we do because we're super power. But when you see them go up, you know, especially if you've

3:30:18.480 --> 3:30:21.920
 ever watched a rocket really launch on a clear night, it'll have the stream to glow and you can

3:30:21.920 --> 3:30:26.080
 tell it's a rocket. But if you don't look up until later, when it starts to get to the outer edge of

3:30:26.080 --> 3:30:31.040
 the atmosphere where the plume coming out of the engine is not constrained, but you can watch this

3:30:31.040 --> 3:30:34.960
 on TV when even the SpaceX ones go up, it's nice and narrow, narrow, narrow. And then it hits a

3:30:34.960 --> 3:30:38.240
 point where it really starts to go up and it starts to come to the sides because there's,

3:30:38.240 --> 3:30:43.040
 you know, the forces aren't holding that all into one unique thing. And it looks really odd.

3:30:43.040 --> 3:30:47.760
 And then it'll go off because it burns out and then you could stay separate. And then you see

3:30:47.760 --> 3:30:52.640
 the next one go off and then it's gone. And people don't understand it because they didn't

3:30:52.640 --> 3:30:55.760
 watch it from launch because we used to sit in our driveway and, you know, Vandenberg is,

3:30:55.760 --> 3:30:58.400
 it was a three hour drive, but you could sit and watch it go, you knew in there and launch

3:30:58.400 --> 3:31:03.360
 and at night you'd watch. You'd watch and it's really cool. If you don't see anything, what you

3:31:03.360 --> 3:31:07.440
 see is the weird clouds from the exhaust plume, you know, what's left, the residue that's sitting

3:31:07.440 --> 3:31:11.520
 in the atmosphere and the wind starts blowing us. You get these really kind of weird shapes in the

3:31:11.520 --> 3:31:16.000
 sky. You know, that's part, but when you go to Phoenix lights and you go, hey, you know, when

3:31:16.000 --> 3:31:19.520
 1,000 people see some, you're going to discredit all 1,000 people, or you're going to try and

3:31:19.520 --> 3:31:24.480
 explain it away with something else, you know, the, you know, the big, it's a weather balloon,

3:31:25.120 --> 3:31:30.480
 you know, it's a weather balloon. Again, just like the tic tac, I think is just inspiring

3:31:30.480 --> 3:31:37.600
 for the limitless nature of the science. I think you're, I think more is going to come out. I think

3:31:38.720 --> 3:31:41.360
 some of the stuff that the, the Two The Stars folks have done.

3:31:42.480 --> 3:31:46.640
 So there's a Two The Stars Academy. What are your thoughts about them? Are they?

3:31:46.640 --> 3:31:52.560
 I talk to them quite a bit. I am not a part of Two The Stars Academy. I, you know, but, you know,

3:31:52.560 --> 3:31:57.440
 like I talked to Lou, I just was texting him before this. Yeah. So he, they're, what's their

3:31:57.440 --> 3:32:02.080
 mission? What's their hope? What's their, what's their, when they started, their mission was to

3:32:03.120 --> 3:32:07.920
 try and don't look at this as little green men, but let's look at this as a technology

3:32:08.640 --> 3:32:13.760
 and let's try and almost reverse engineer and figure out how these things operate and how can

3:32:13.760 --> 3:32:18.320
 we explain this from using our knowledge, you know, physics based knowledge to go, how would

3:32:18.320 --> 3:32:23.520
 something like this operate? That's really their bottom line was to try and use and then couple

3:32:23.520 --> 3:32:30.560
 that with, because they've got the series unidentified, couple that with television to get

3:32:30.560 --> 3:32:36.000
 the word out. So you're actually putting something instead of, because everyone has a theory, you

3:32:36.000 --> 3:32:41.040
 know, ancient aliens covers all kinds of theories, you know, it's kind of off of, oh my God. And,

3:32:41.040 --> 3:32:45.600
 and I've seen the stuff and I've seen stuff that I've said taken out of context on shows that I

3:32:45.600 --> 3:32:50.960
 did not talk to. So there's all that because you can take a clip and go, oh, it's this, it's that,

3:32:50.960 --> 3:32:55.200
 you know, and if I know about stuff like it, you can't technically use my likeness unless I tell

3:32:55.200 --> 3:32:58.800
 you you can. So if I haven't signed something, you can't do it. There was a guy who put something

3:32:58.800 --> 3:33:01.840
 out and I was in it and I told him, you can take it down and you can talk to the lawyers because

3:33:01.840 --> 3:33:06.320
 I'm not, I'm not supporting you. So they use it to tell some kind of narrative that doesn't,

3:33:06.320 --> 3:33:10.000
 it's not connected to reality. Because let's face it, if you're making TV shows, there's two

3:33:10.000 --> 3:33:14.880
 reasons to do it. One, you want to get word out or two, you want to make money or three both.

3:33:14.880 --> 3:33:19.840
 And so usually it's, I would say the, the make money is probably the biggest thing to put a TV

3:33:19.840 --> 3:33:25.200
 show out. And the, the mission of the, to the Starz Academy is to not do that. This is, is to

3:33:25.200 --> 3:33:30.240
 try to get some. When I, when they started and I talked to them because I've talked to Tom and I've

3:33:30.240 --> 3:33:38.160
 talked to Lou and those are the two main players, it was to basically demystify the fact and get rid

3:33:38.160 --> 3:33:43.600
 of the, the stigma that's tied to UFOs and let's look at it from a science base and then use TV

3:33:43.600 --> 3:33:47.360
 to get the word out on the progress. And they've done some pretty cool things. I mean, you know,

3:33:47.360 --> 3:33:52.480
 they've, the, the Italian government gave them all kinds of files that had been, you know, property

3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:57.760
 of their government. They got a bunch from, it might have been Argentina gave them all kinds of

3:33:57.760 --> 3:34:02.640
 stuff. Like here's all our records. What can you do with it to try and now pull from country based

3:34:02.640 --> 3:34:07.440
 to a more global based research, which is what you were talking about. And then using independent

3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:11.760
 scientists that are not tied to a government, I mean any government, but just using independent

3:34:11.760 --> 3:34:15.680
 research agencies to start looking at some of the metallurgy because you go, oh, I found this,

3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:19.280
 we had this piece of metal. What is it? And some of the stuff has been explained. They've got some

3:34:19.280 --> 3:34:24.160
 objects, artifacts that have not been explained. And that's slowly coming out, you know, and I think

3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:28.160
 and your hope is the US government will release some of the government is the government, the

3:34:28.160 --> 3:34:32.720
 US government came out a month ago and said, you, we have, we have, we have material that we cannot

3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:38.240
 explain the origin. They have said that they just haven't released the records from the Roswell

3:34:38.240 --> 3:34:43.440
 thing, which I keep joking about. I'm like, huh, it's 70 some years old. I mean, I let it out.

3:34:43.440 --> 3:34:49.440
 I think you put it beautifully that in this time, that will be a heck of an inspiring,

3:34:49.440 --> 3:34:54.480
 hopeful thing to see. Like people don't just to distract. Yeah. The division is,

3:34:55.120 --> 3:34:59.600
 I mean, nothing will unite us humans descendants of chimps.

3:35:02.080 --> 3:35:07.360
 Like the idea that there's life out there. Oh, it would literally change. Because I said this

3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:10.480
 a while ago, I forget, I think I was at the London sometimes had called me and I said,

3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:14.640
 you know, personally, I think this is a global issue. It's not. If there is stuff coming down,

3:35:14.640 --> 3:35:17.200
 which we're pretty sure there is, there's enough stuff that we can't explain.

3:35:18.240 --> 3:35:21.680
 If there is stuff coming down, then this is not a country based thing. And it's not about

3:35:21.680 --> 3:35:25.600
 technology. And it's not about who's going to win the next war, because you don't know what they're

3:35:25.600 --> 3:35:33.600
 doing. So you got really a couple of theories. One, you've got ET or close encounters. And the

3:35:33.600 --> 3:35:39.360
 other extreme is you've got independence day. Are you going to prepare and bet on ET and close

3:35:39.360 --> 3:35:44.080
 encounters? Or do you actually try and do stuff in case it is independence day, you actually have

3:35:44.080 --> 3:35:49.360
 a game plan. And when you get into independence day, that scenario, you know, and I don't like

3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:55.920
 going too much into sci fi, but let's just say in theory that that becomes a reality. It's not a US,

3:35:55.920 --> 3:36:04.000
 Russia, China, England, France, Spain, name any country in any continent, it becomes a global

3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:09.600
 issue. And the only way you can deny it, just like Americans, we all, you know, we're divided.

3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:13.600
 We spend that way forever. So if you think we won't get through this, we'll get through it because

3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:18.640
 we've had times just like this before. Until Nazi Germany pops up. But if Nazi Germany pops up,

3:36:18.640 --> 3:36:21.760
 or someone flies two airplanes into the World Trade Center, and then all of a sudden we're

3:36:21.760 --> 3:36:28.000
 all like United, we all also have very, very short memories. Yes, we do. Exactly. It's when you

3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:36.320
 look and go, well, we can do this. And you go, no, no, if you think that everyone on the planet is

3:36:36.320 --> 3:36:42.800
 good, you need to stop taking the drugs that you're taking. You know, we said this, there were people

3:36:42.800 --> 3:36:48.000
 during the rise of Hitler. No, no, it's okay. And no, no, it's okay. We're not going to do,

3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:53.760
 we're not going to stop. No, no, it's okay. No, no, it's okay. And you got to think the only thing

3:36:53.760 --> 3:37:01.600
 that stopped Hitler was his ego by going into Russia. If he just stuck with the path with Stalin

3:37:01.600 --> 3:37:05.840
 and not went to the east and had to fight, and it was really the Russian winner that crushed him,

3:37:06.720 --> 3:37:11.760
 and he would have put all his high troops to the other side, there would have been a totally

3:37:11.760 --> 3:37:15.680
 different outcome. The man in the iron, the man in the high tower or whatever, it's a Netflix show

3:37:15.680 --> 3:37:21.200
 where Nazi actually wins it. And you look, you know, we didn't know everything that was going on,

3:37:21.200 --> 3:37:25.440
 especially the atrocities with the concentration camps and what he was doing to the Jews.

3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:29.520
 I mean, it's, you look at that going, if you really want to see evil, and then there's the

3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:33.680
 whole side of what Stalin did, because he actually exterminated more people than Hitler did,

3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:39.840
 but that never gets the press. And the thing is, we forget this, we forget this history

3:37:40.640 --> 3:37:45.360
 in our conflicts today, we forget that there is the nature of evil, we forget that there's real

3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:53.760
 evil in the world. And the thing to fight that evil is to be united, to be both, it's like this

3:37:53.760 --> 3:38:00.480
 interesting line, like you talked about Joe Rogan, of being both like kind to each other,

3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:08.640
 compassionate, empathetic, but also being like strong and a bad motherfucker when you need to,

3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:14.960
 to make sure that you, that like, there's a balance between kindness and force that

3:38:14.960 --> 3:38:20.240
 is you use force when force is necessary, but you don't have to walk around like Billy badass

3:38:20.240 --> 3:38:24.480
 all the time. I mean, some of the toughest people that I grew up with that literally could kick the

3:38:24.480 --> 3:38:28.880
 shit out of whoever came near them. They never got in fights because one, even people that didn't

3:38:28.880 --> 3:38:33.600
 know them because they were actually nice guys, you know, they were, they're just good dudes.

3:38:34.160 --> 3:38:39.120
 But you know, if you cross them, like I had a friend of mine, he was, he's a nationally ranked

3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:46.640
 wrestler. It went to, went to Naval Academy with me. He's a very, very good friend of mine. And he

3:38:46.640 --> 3:38:52.160
 is, when you meet him, and he wrestled at 190 pounds, and he did not lose a match his senior

3:38:52.160 --> 3:38:55.840
 year until he went to nationals, he just had a bad day. He actually lost to a guy he had pummeled

3:38:55.840 --> 3:39:00.720
 the shit out of. And he would cross, it was funny, we joke about it, even with him, because when you

3:39:00.720 --> 3:39:04.960
 meet him, he's like the nicest like local, hey, hey, dude, you know, hey, how you doing? He's super

3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:11.360
 nice. And he would cross that ring on a wrestling mat. As soon as he crossed that ring, it was like

3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:16.880
 a totally different person. And he would go out there and just destroy people. I mean, physically

3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:22.480
 destroy, like put a hurt on. And he would get done, and he's like super humble, and they'd raise

3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:26.720
 his hand, and he would, he'd have this blank expression, they'd raise his hand, and he'd walk

3:39:26.720 --> 3:39:30.720
 off and as soon as he crossed the line, he'd, he'd look up and swung, hey, hi guys, how you doing?

3:39:30.720 --> 3:39:34.160
 Like he literally just went and could rip someone's arms off. But as soon as he crossed the line,

3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:38.400
 he was a totally different person. He's like, and he's that way today. He wouldn't even tell you

3:39:38.400 --> 3:39:44.640
 he's a wrestler. Yeah. That's kind of a symbol of the best of America. That's what America is.

3:39:44.640 --> 3:39:50.560
 Oh, he's. That wrestler. He's a. He crossed the line, you're, you're, you can be hard, but when,

3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:56.720
 once you're off the mat, you're just a kind human being. Yeah. I know you're super humble,

3:39:56.720 --> 3:40:04.640
 uh, saying it's better to be lucky than good, but your story is inspiring.

3:40:05.920 --> 3:40:10.880
 That's the entire trajectory of having a dream of accomplishing that dream,

3:40:10.880 --> 3:40:18.240
 of having one hell of a career. What advice would you give to a young person to a young

3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:23.760
 version of yourself today that listens to this and is inspired that wants to fly

3:40:23.760 --> 3:40:30.000
 or wants to go to space and wants to build the rocket? Is there advice you could give them

3:40:30.800 --> 3:40:35.200
 about life, about career, about anything? Yeah. Yeah. Um,

3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:44.000
 first let me start with, uh, and you had a question on inspirational people. So my grandfather,

3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:50.320
 I had mentioned him earlier, huge funeral, a beer delivery guy, um, was delivering beer in

3:40:50.320 --> 3:40:54.960
 the 60s riots where the guys, the black in the black neighborhoods where, you know, white people

3:40:54.960 --> 3:40:58.480
 didn't go. And my grandfather was just silly and he was one of the first ones in his family

3:40:58.480 --> 3:41:02.480
 born in the United States. So my great grandmother and I had aunts and uncles that I knew growing up

3:41:02.480 --> 3:41:09.360
 that actually came over on the boat. Um, huge, huge guy and just the nicest, friendliest would

3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:14.160
 give you the shirt off his back, obviously proven by his funeral. And I'm talking at his funeral,

3:41:14.160 --> 3:41:20.160
 the head of the Black Panthers was at his funeral in Toledo, Ohio. The mafia guys were at his funeral

3:41:20.160 --> 3:41:26.320
 in Toledo, Ohio. Uh, I mean, it was literally a mix of, of, of who's who. And, uh, he had told me

3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:29.760
 once, you know, because when you're little, you start looking and, and I grew up basically,

3:41:30.400 --> 3:41:33.760
 I was probably middle class, lower middle class. My dad was a fireman there. You're not rich.

3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:36.880
 He's working for the city. It was a paycheck to paycheck living is how I grew up.

3:41:38.080 --> 3:41:40.880
 And I was talking to my grandfather one day and he said something to me and this is,

3:41:40.880 --> 3:41:44.480
 this is literally how I run my life. He said, it was about money because you'd see, you know,

3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:47.760
 back in the day, if you saw someone in a Mercedes, that was rare. You know, they weren't

3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:50.960
 everywhere. You know, people didn't, you couldn't lease the car. He actually bought a car and

3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:56.720
 usually bought a car with cash. Um, so it was a totally different than we are now. And he said,

3:41:56.720 --> 3:42:00.960
 he goes, you know, David, he goes, they're no better than you and you're no better than anyone

3:42:00.960 --> 3:42:04.640
 else. He goes, you got to remember that. He goes, everyone's different. He goes, treat everyone

3:42:04.640 --> 3:42:09.200
 with the respect and dignity that they deserve. He goes, and if they're poor, if they're homeless,

3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:14.480
 he goes, it doesn't make them a bad person. It just, that's, that's who they chose to be. And

3:42:14.480 --> 3:42:19.040
 you make choices in your life, but never ever look down on someone because, you know, there will

3:42:19.040 --> 3:42:22.640
 always be someone that will look down on you and you should never ever do that. And I kept that

3:42:22.640 --> 3:42:29.600
 close to me. He was huge influences, my mom's dad, just a big, big influence in my life and the way I

3:42:29.600 --> 3:42:36.080
 carried myself. Um, and he was one that would say, you know, you can be anything you want to be,

3:42:36.080 --> 3:42:40.800
 you know, he grew up dirt poor, you know, and the fact that he had bought a house and took

3:42:40.800 --> 3:42:44.800
 good care of my grandmother and did stuff like that, you know, to him, that was a success.

3:42:45.440 --> 3:42:49.680
 And to me, it was always, you know, trying to better and move on. And he was the one,

3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:54.800
 you know, my parents were a big part of this too, was instilling that that anything is possible. So

3:42:54.800 --> 3:43:00.320
 when I'm four years and 11 months old in 1969, you know, and I'm watching Neil Armstrong walk on

3:43:00.320 --> 3:43:04.160
 the moon and I'm asking my mom and she says, well, they were all military pilots. And, you know, we

3:43:04.160 --> 3:43:08.560
 had an international guard that at the time was flying F 100. So I'm dating myself. Um,

3:43:08.560 --> 3:43:12.320
 and I was just fascinated with flight. And I just looked at that going, that's really what I want

3:43:12.320 --> 3:43:15.920
 to do. And I never lost sight of that. There was always, I could do this or do that. And

3:43:15.920 --> 3:43:20.080
 when I was going to go to college before I enlisted in the Marine Corps, I was accepted into natural

3:43:20.080 --> 3:43:24.720
 resources at Ohio State. And I'm like, ah, if I can't fly, I'll go be a forest ranger because I

3:43:24.720 --> 3:43:28.320
 wanted to hang out in one of those towers in Colorado and look for fires because that's just,

3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:32.560
 I like that stuff. You know, it was that or be an oceanographer because I was fascinated with

3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:36.160
 Jacques Cousteau. And actually that's my degree, my undergrad degree is Jacques Cousteau. So

3:43:36.160 --> 3:43:40.640
 influences are Neil Armstrong and Jacques Cousteau. I have an oceanography degree,

3:43:40.640 --> 3:43:46.640
 I got an MBA from the University of Houston, Goku's got to mention them. And so you're looking,

3:43:46.640 --> 3:43:50.320
 people go, what are you going to do with that? And I said, you know, I got an oceanography

3:43:50.320 --> 3:43:53.360
 degree because I got, well, I'm going to sail on the ocean. So at least if the ship sinks,

3:43:53.360 --> 3:43:56.640
 I'll know where I'm at. And that was a kind of a running joke. And then.

3:43:57.200 --> 3:44:02.080
 And then those, so these passions and underneath it is the, is the belief that

3:44:02.080 --> 3:44:06.480
 you can be anything you want to. You can. You know, I told my kids this, you know,

3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:10.240
 when they were young, you know, it was tough, especially for my son. So when Nate was about

3:44:10.240 --> 3:44:14.800
 five, six years, we knew Nate was colorblind. You know, my, my wife's brothers are both

3:44:14.800 --> 3:44:18.560
 colorblind. It's really color deprived, color to blind you see black and white. He can't tell,

3:44:18.560 --> 3:44:22.880
 he has issues with greens, reds, browns. It's funny if you're ever around someone like that.

3:44:22.880 --> 3:44:25.440
 Because I'll go, I'll go, what are you looking at? He goes right over there by the red thing. I'm

3:44:25.440 --> 3:44:29.200
 like, what are you looking at? I go this, I like, he had a hat on one day. I go, which one are you

3:44:29.200 --> 3:44:32.000
 going to get? He had a hat in his hand. It was green. He goes, I'm going to get the green one.

3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:34.800
 I go, oh, this one right here. He goes, no, the one on my head. I go, Nate, that one's brown.

3:44:34.800 --> 3:44:38.880
 He's like, leave me alone, dad. He got the brown hat because to him, it looked green.

3:44:40.160 --> 3:44:43.120
 So he couldn't fly. He came and he said, I go, what do you want to do, Nate? You know,

3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:45.680
 you're talking to your kids and you know, what do you want to do? He goes, I want to be a pilot.

3:44:45.680 --> 3:44:48.720
 Now, now I got to tell him, because he's looking at me because I'm a pilot,

3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:53.840
 do you can't be a pilot? He's like, why can't I be a pilot? I said, because you, you got eye issues.

3:44:53.840 --> 3:44:58.960
 You know, so you got to redirect. And the other one was because I had to, I stopped flying. I was

3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:04.160
 42 years old and I was like, and it was my childhood dream. So it's like a pro athlete. I know exactly

3:45:04.160 --> 3:45:09.600
 what it feels like when, you know, Brett Favre has to walk away from the NFL when you still can do it.

3:45:09.600 --> 3:45:12.720
 Good choice of quarterback, by the way, the greatest of all time, but whatever.

3:45:12.720 --> 3:45:17.680
 So you do, when you look at it and you go, I understand what those guys feel like when you

3:45:17.680 --> 3:45:20.320
 have to walk away from something that you love and you think you can still do it.

3:45:20.320 --> 3:45:25.920
 So I told them, I said, look, I was talking to both of my kids and I said, you know,

3:45:26.800 --> 3:45:32.080
 find something that you want to do, that you love to do, and that you can do your whole life.

3:45:33.440 --> 3:45:38.800
 And you should be able to do good things for other people. You want to be able to help other people.

3:45:39.600 --> 3:45:44.800
 That's what I said. So both of my kids, and there's no one in my family, both of my children,

3:45:44.800 --> 3:45:49.120
 one of them is, my daughter is a doctor doing residency in internal medicine right now.

3:45:49.120 --> 3:45:55.120
 And my son is in his third year and they're both going to be doctors. And so I look at it as, you

3:45:55.120 --> 3:45:58.960
 know, people go, oh, you got two doctors. I don't care. I told my kids, if you want to be a garbage

3:45:58.960 --> 3:46:03.840
 man or you want to dig ditches, I don't care. Just be the best ditch digger that you can be.

3:46:04.400 --> 3:46:08.880
 I said, and be happy doing it. Because what you also find is that we are in this big pursuit of

3:46:08.880 --> 3:46:11.760
 money, money, money, money, money, money, money. That's what makes the world go round.

3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:15.200
 But what you realize, and I'll go back to my grandfather, who didn't have a lot of money,

3:46:15.200 --> 3:46:18.720
 and he was probably one of the most happy people on life. And unfortunately,

3:46:18.720 --> 3:46:23.840
 he died at 65. He had a massive heart attack because he didn't tell that he kind of knew

3:46:23.840 --> 3:46:28.640
 it was happening. And he just made the choice to do it. It was devastating to the entire family.

3:46:29.840 --> 3:46:34.000
 But he didn't have a lot of money. But I'll tell you what, I know a lot of rich people who have

3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:38.480
 funerals and there's nobody at them. And my grandfather, who's a beer delivery guy, had,

3:46:40.320 --> 3:46:44.400
 it literally, it was like three miles long. It was crazy. Yeah. Who died the Pope? That was

3:46:44.400 --> 3:46:49.600
 because he's a Catholic. He's Italian. He goes, who died the Pope? And I go and ask my grandfather.

3:46:49.600 --> 3:46:54.560
 And then the next funeral I went to was my aunt, his sister. And it was like, 30 people. And I

3:46:54.560 --> 3:47:00.480
 looked at my mother and I said, where's everybody at? She goes, oh, no, this is normal. This is

3:47:00.480 --> 3:47:08.320
 what a normal funeral looks like. So for young kids, bottom line, one, be nice. Kindness will get

3:47:08.320 --> 3:47:13.520
 you, I'm a big believer in karma. Kindness will get you a long way in the world. It's easy.

3:47:13.520 --> 3:47:19.600
 It's easy to be nice. It doesn't cost you anything. I said, and get rid of the hate.

3:47:19.600 --> 3:47:24.080
 And number two is follow your dreams because everyone is capable of everything. And there's

3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:29.360
 a self realism. If you really have trouble with math, getting a PhD in applied math,

3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:33.920
 it's probably not something you're going to be able to do. But understand yourself what your

3:47:33.920 --> 3:47:37.520
 own capabilities are and you know inside your heart. Don't let anyone ever tell you what you

3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:43.600
 can and can't do. You have to determine that yourself and go for it. And you can do anything.

3:47:43.600 --> 3:47:48.080
 It's just, it's a great, the world's incredible. It really is.

3:47:48.080 --> 3:47:53.120
 Let me ask the last big ridiculous question. So you've lived

3:47:54.640 --> 3:48:02.160
 much of your life, your career is kind of at the edge of life and death. So let me ask kind of

3:48:02.160 --> 3:48:10.560
 several different ways, the same kind of question. One, do you, have you pondered your mortality,

3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:20.480
 the finiteness of it? And the bigger question to ask even in the context of your tic tac encounter

3:48:21.280 --> 3:48:27.200
 is what do you think is the meaning of this thing we got going on here, the meaning of life, human

3:48:27.200 --> 3:48:35.120
 life in this sense? So let me start with, have I pondered my own mortality? Yes, quite often.

3:48:36.640 --> 3:48:41.680
 And I don't get into my religious beliefs or what I am, but I will tell you that I do believe in God.

3:48:42.400 --> 3:48:45.520
 I've just seen too many things in the world that I can't explain.

3:48:46.400 --> 3:48:50.000
 And some people will explain it by subconscious. So I'll give you a story and this kind of puts

3:48:50.000 --> 3:48:54.640
 in the thing of, do I fear death? So I had a good friend of mine that I used to fly with.

3:48:54.640 --> 3:49:00.240
 We were stationed in Japan together and Japan had this incinerator that put all kinds of dioxins.

3:49:00.240 --> 3:49:04.320
 So there's a real high cancer rate for those that served on the base in Natsuki, Japan.

3:49:07.440 --> 3:49:13.360
 Him and his wife had one son and their son passed away just before his 18th birthday of cancer.

3:49:14.560 --> 3:49:20.240
 And I was hanging out with, I'll call him John, and I was hanging out with John. We were in oil

3:49:20.240 --> 3:49:24.880
 and gas. He had come to the same company and we were doing an event together. And he was opening

3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:29.120
 up to me because we were actually the demo pilots. We do the demonstration for air shows and stuff.

3:49:29.840 --> 3:49:37.200
 And him and I were sitting there talking and he was giving me the whole story and how he had

3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:41.760
 really changed his look on life that we're only here for a finite time and that we're all going

3:49:41.760 --> 3:49:47.440
 to die. Well, unfortunately, after all that, when it was really going, him and his wife had moved to

3:49:47.440 --> 3:49:51.760
 a location that would fit there close to the water where they could do stuff. And I won't say

3:49:51.760 --> 3:49:57.120
 where. And he was doing what he loved to do and he got diagnosed with throat cancer.

3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:05.440
 And I was talking to him, it was probably about maybe two months before he died.

3:50:08.160 --> 3:50:14.880
 And I said, dude, you're sad. I mean, this is your friend. And I'm kind of really bummed out.

3:50:14.880 --> 3:50:19.440
 And this is the guy, this is the guy that's dying of cancer. And here's what he tells me. He says,

3:50:20.080 --> 3:50:26.000
 Dave, dude, we're all going to die. He goes, but I have to look at it. I have to make the

3:50:26.000 --> 3:50:31.680
 best of the time that I have. And I said, I understand that. And he goes, with the exception

3:50:32.400 --> 3:50:40.320
 of not being with my wife, who he loved dearly, he goes, I'm okay with dying. I've had a really good

3:50:40.320 --> 3:50:49.280
 life. And about, because actually the original announcement when he finally passed away,

3:50:49.280 --> 3:50:52.720
 Buddy of mine called me because I don't do Facebook and his wife had put it on Facebook

3:50:52.720 --> 3:50:58.720
 that he had passed. And about the day before he died, for some reason, I was thinking about him.

3:51:00.080 --> 3:51:05.680
 And I had a dream where I think it was a dream or an altered reality, you can get into whatever.

3:51:05.680 --> 3:51:14.400
 But he was there. It was just him and I. And I was really sad in the dream. I was actually crying,

3:51:14.400 --> 3:51:18.240
 and he was there. And he was actually in his uniform. He was in his whites because he was a

3:51:18.240 --> 3:51:22.800
 Navy. And we were just talking and he looked at me and he said, and this isn't my dream. He's like,

3:51:22.800 --> 3:51:28.480
 Dave, it's all going to be okay. And this is like, and this is a vivid conversation I have.

3:51:28.480 --> 3:51:33.440
 There's people are going to think I'm weird about this, but I know what my dream was. And

3:51:33.440 --> 3:51:38.080
 then maybe it's my subconscious creating the dream. But in reality, to me, this was real,

3:51:38.080 --> 3:51:43.600
 that it was put there for a reason. And he basically explained everything. It's okay.

3:51:43.600 --> 3:51:47.920
 I'm going to be fine. My wife is fine. He goes, this is what's meant to be.

3:51:49.120 --> 3:51:53.360
 But in the bottom line was make use of every day that you have because you don't know.

3:51:54.240 --> 3:51:56.640
 And literally two days later, I find out that he passed.

3:51:56.640 --> 3:52:03.920
 But ultimately, he accepted the finiteness of it.

3:52:03.920 --> 3:52:08.960
 He did. Well, you have to. And it's like I talk about money and job position and this and that.

3:52:08.960 --> 3:52:11.840
 And I said, you can get in any, you can go to a company. Just remember,

3:52:11.840 --> 3:52:15.360
 when you want to be a VP of a company, you sell your soul to the company. You have to.

3:52:16.160 --> 3:52:19.440
 I said, if you look, I joke with people at work. And I said,

3:52:19.440 --> 3:52:22.320
 I said, when you ever think that you're important or this guy has that, I said,

3:52:22.320 --> 3:52:26.880
 when you're sitting on 93 or 95, 128 and you're sitting in traffic and we're stopped,

3:52:26.880 --> 3:52:29.680
 which doesn't happen right now because of COVID. But normally it's stopped. It's

3:52:29.680 --> 3:52:32.880
 bumper to bumper in your sitting here, like I was coming down here by the gas tank.

3:52:34.800 --> 3:52:38.080
 When you're sitting there, look left and look right, you know, and there can be a

3:52:38.080 --> 3:52:43.120
 Lamborghini or an S550 Mercedes. And on the other side, there could be some piece of crap car.

3:52:44.560 --> 3:52:48.560
 We're all sitting on the same freeway at the same time trying to do the same thing,

3:52:48.560 --> 3:52:52.880
 which is just get home so we can be with our family. Because the most important thing that we

3:52:52.880 --> 3:52:58.400
 have, it ain't money. It ain't our job. It's not our position. I go, because when it's all said

3:52:58.400 --> 3:53:03.840
 and done, you could be, you know, you can be with the exception of the presidents of the United

3:53:03.840 --> 3:53:10.160
 States. I mean, name the vice presidents. Most people can't. And eventually they're going to die.

3:53:10.160 --> 3:53:14.400
 Or eventually you're going to see a statue of a guy from the 1700s in the Boston area and you're

3:53:14.400 --> 3:53:18.960
 going to call, I don't even know who that guy was. Did he impact my life? He probably did. But

3:53:18.960 --> 3:53:24.400
 eventually people forget. You realize what's important now. And the one thing that you have

3:53:25.280 --> 3:53:30.720
 is your family and your close friends. And that's it. You can take all the money or everything

3:53:30.720 --> 3:53:34.720
 else. If you're down on your luck, you know, who is going to be at we eyes as a joke? Who are your

3:53:34.720 --> 3:53:38.640
 true friends? It's the person while there's, there's a once that I won't say, but you know,

3:53:38.640 --> 3:53:42.960
 hey, you're broke down on a road in the middle of nowhere and it's three o clock in the morning.

3:53:42.960 --> 3:53:46.000
 Who are you going to call is going to get in their car without complaining and come and get you.

3:53:46.720 --> 3:53:53.200
 And that's life. Those are the people you love. It's, it's, it's the people you truly care about.

3:53:53.200 --> 3:53:57.120
 And contrary to, I have, you know, oh my God, I got 6,000 Facebook friends.

3:53:57.760 --> 3:54:01.680
 You got about that many real friends that you can count on. And that's it.

3:54:01.680 --> 3:54:05.280
 Everything else doesn't matter. No, it doesn't matter. It doesn't mean you don't be nice. I mean,

3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:08.640
 I have, there's acquaintance friends that I'll do anything for and then come to my house and

3:54:08.640 --> 3:54:13.360
 stuff. But then there's the people that, you know, you know, like my cousins who are like my brothers

3:54:13.360 --> 3:54:21.360
 that, you know, at a moment's notice, you know, when, when my uncle passed away at a young age,

3:54:21.360 --> 3:54:25.920
 you know, who lived literally right down the street from me and my cousin Chad, and I got

3:54:25.920 --> 3:54:29.920
 two boys, there's 14 of us, but there's only two boys. There's three of us together. And we all

3:54:29.920 --> 3:54:34.720
 grew up in the same neighborhood, same schools, play football together, all that. I said, if one

3:54:34.720 --> 3:54:39.120
 of those, if Ray or Chad ever needs me, if something happens, like when my uncle died, it wasn't,

3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:43.280
 it wasn't an issue if I'm coming home. It's I'm booking the ticket. I don't give a shit what

3:54:43.280 --> 3:54:50.320
 it costs because I will be there to be there with you. And then those two guys and my college

3:54:50.320 --> 3:54:58.320
 roommate is another one that I'm very, very close with, you know, if there's, I have a handful

3:54:58.320 --> 3:55:02.720
 of people that, you know, I will drop literally everything, even if my wife would be pissed at

3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:07.760
 me at times. She's like, seriously, I got to do it. And now she knows, and it's the same thing

3:55:07.760 --> 3:55:12.000
 with her. I mean, she knows that there are certain people in her life that if they really need her

3:55:12.000 --> 3:55:20.400
 and she has to go, she would go and I would let her go. So given all that, I'm honored that you

3:55:20.400 --> 3:55:25.920
 would come here and talk to me and take the time. Dave, it was one of the best conversations I've

3:55:25.920 --> 3:55:30.960
 ever had. Thank you so much. It's a pretty long one. It's probably sets the record for the longest

3:55:30.960 --> 3:55:37.280
 one. So I, I mean, I'm a loss of words. One of my favorite conversations. Thank you so much for

3:55:37.280 --> 3:55:42.640
