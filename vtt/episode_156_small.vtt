00:35.680 --> 00:40.560
 As a side note, let me say that I will continue talking to scientists, engineers, historians,

00:40.560 --> 00:46.560
 mathematicians, and so on, but I will also talk to the people who Jack Kerouac called

00:46.560 --> 00:52.160
 the Mad Ones in his book On the Road, that is one of my favorite books.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.160
 He wrote,

00:53.160 --> 00:59.040
 The only people for me are the Mad Ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad

00:59.040 --> 01:04.600
 to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say

01:04.600 --> 01:12.040
 a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, like fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like

01:12.040 --> 01:18.120
 spiders across the stars, and in the middle you see the blue center light pop and everybody

01:18.120 --> 01:20.680
 goes.

01:20.680 --> 01:25.960
 Some of these conversations will be a bit of a gamble, in that I have no idea how they

01:25.960 --> 01:31.240
 will turn out, but I'm willing to risk it for a chance at a bit of an adventure, and

01:31.240 --> 01:37.040
 I'm happy and honored that Tim this time wanted to take a chance as well.

 And now, here's my conversation with Tim Dillon.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.600
 What would you like your tombstone to read?

01:54.600 --> 01:58.840
 It's a good way to summarize the essence of a human being.

01:58.840 --> 02:07.480
 I would like it to say this has not been paid for, and I want my living relatives to struggle

02:07.480 --> 02:11.320
 to pay for it, and I think I would like them to be hounded every day.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.840
 I would like people to call and go, listen, we don't want to ever excavate a body, but

02:14.840 --> 02:18.760
 we will, because this has not been paid for.

02:18.760 --> 02:24.800
 I love the idea of leaving the world, like debt, leaving the world in lots of debt that

02:24.800 --> 02:27.080
 other people have to deal with.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.760
 And I know people that have done that, I know people that have been in families where that's

02:30.760 --> 02:38.200
 happened where someone has to sit and just curse the sky, because they don't have a physical

02:38.200 --> 02:43.400
 person anymore to be angry at, but they still have to deal with the decisions that person

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
 made.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.880
 It's deeply tragic, but that's always struck me as very funny.

02:46.880 --> 02:52.160
 Well, it's the kind of immortality, the debt, because if the debt lasts for a long time,

02:52.160 --> 02:57.120
 the anger lasts for a long time, and then you are now immortal in the minds of many.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.480
 You arouse emotion in the minds of many.

02:59.480 --> 03:07.280
 My mother's best friend in the town I grew up in, her husband shot himself in the driveway.

03:07.280 --> 03:12.760
 And my mother's friend never got a chance to just grieve, because he owed so much money,

03:12.760 --> 03:15.400
 she would come over and go, I hate him.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.560
 I fucking hate him.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.120
 And it was just such an interesting thing to see somebody who, and her kids ended up getting

03:21.120 --> 03:25.840
 angry at her for that, because they didn't understand why she would hate a guy who was

03:25.840 --> 03:31.280
 clearly suffering, but she goes, he took the selfish way out, he fucked us.

03:31.280 --> 03:37.960
 And it was always interesting for me to just remember that you can leave Earth and still

03:37.960 --> 03:41.960
 be a problem.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.560
 It's kind of a special person, so that's, I think, what I'd like my tombstone to read.

03:45.560 --> 03:49.480
 Yeah, there's a show called Louie with Lucy Cannon, if you watched it.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.640
 I'm aware of it.

03:50.640 --> 03:55.880
 There's this moment, I think, where an old guy is talking to Louie about the best part

03:55.880 --> 04:05.200
 about love is after you break up, and it's remembering the good times and feeling that

04:05.200 --> 04:07.240
 loss, the pain of that loss.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.480
 The worst part about love is when you no longer feel that pain.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.480
 Interesting.

04:11.480 --> 04:17.560
 The pain of losing somebody lasts longer, is more intense than lasts longer than the

04:17.560 --> 04:18.680
 actual love.

04:18.680 --> 04:23.400
 So his argument was like, the pain is what love really is.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.400
 Wow.

04:24.400 --> 04:30.600
 In the same way that anger, your tombstone would arouse is, would last longer.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.400
 And that's deeply like a human thing.

04:33.400 --> 04:38.600
 Like, why do we attach happiness to the way we should remember others?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.520
 It could be just anger.

04:40.520 --> 04:47.040
 I know so many people who will have deeply complicated feelings when, you know, I did

04:47.040 --> 04:50.800
 drugs for many years, so, and I spent time with some wild people.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.400
 And their parents were also wild people.

04:53.400 --> 04:59.960
 And some of their parents have done crazy things to them, and, you know, have created

04:59.960 --> 05:06.760
 situations that were not productive for child rearing.

05:06.760 --> 05:11.800
 And so I know that when those people die, it's going to be a very mixed bag, like there's

05:11.800 --> 05:17.320
 going to be a lot of complex emotions like, hey, we loved that guy, but also when we

05:17.320 --> 05:25.960
 look back, he was a horrible father, a horrible husband, but he was fun.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.920
 And we don't put enough stock in that, but there will be a push and pull.

05:28.920 --> 05:33.200
 And I'll be the one kind of bringing up like, hey, he was a lot of fun.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.800
 He was a lot, remember when he stuck us, you know, one of the things, this particular

05:37.800 --> 05:42.040
 person I'm talking about, we were at a bar, me and my friend were there, we were having

05:42.040 --> 05:46.880
 dinner, and his father, who was, you know, an alcoholic, you know, a guy that would

05:46.880 --> 05:51.560
 go out every night and didn't work, you know, refused to work, would lie and say he was

05:51.560 --> 05:53.440
 going to work and then go to a bar.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.000
 I mean, just a fun person.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
 And we were sitting at this bar restaurant, and the bartender, we see his father walk

06:02.000 --> 06:07.560
 up to the bartender and say, pointed us, pointed our table and go and put the thumbs up and

06:07.560 --> 06:09.040
 the bartender nodded.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.760
 And then the father walked over to our table and he said, listen, I just want to let you

06:11.760 --> 06:13.760
 know, I just bought you dinner.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.440
 And I looked at his son, I said, he's a pretty good guy.

06:17.440 --> 06:21.120
 And then he climbed over the little fence down to the water and got his little boat.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.760
 It was a little cigarette boat, and he just drove away.

06:23.760 --> 06:28.960
 And in about an hour later, we went, we said, I think that guy took care of the bill, but

06:28.960 --> 06:30.560
 she said, well, go talk to the bartender.

06:30.560 --> 06:34.600
 So we just walked to the bartender and he goes, he handed us a bill and the bill was

06:34.600 --> 06:36.520
 for like a thousand dollars.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.440
 And we said, wait a minute, what the hell's going on?

06:38.440 --> 06:42.080
 And he goes, the guy that left an hour ago said, you were going to take care of his bill.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.400
 He's been drinking here all week.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.120
 And we go, what are you talking about?

06:46.120 --> 06:50.560
 And he goes, remember, he pointed at you, he put the thumbs up and you guys waved.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
 You remember that?

06:51.560 --> 06:56.280
 And the guy, and we went, yeah, and I just looked at my friend and I went, you know,

06:56.280 --> 07:00.160
 your dad is just, we're going to remember him for all kinds of reasons.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.640
 But to you, he was fun.

07:01.640 --> 07:02.640
 He was a lot of fun.

07:02.640 --> 07:03.640
 He wasn't my dad.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.640
 But I spent a lot of time with him.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.640
 I was in two boating accidents with him.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.000
 You know, two boating accidents.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.320
 Alcohol involved, drugs involved.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.920
 Yes, he was usually alcohol was involved when he left his house.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.920
 And when he was at home as well.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.360
 But I was in two boating accidents.

07:17.360 --> 07:21.840
 And do you know how fun someone has to be to get in a second boating accident?

07:21.840 --> 07:28.560
 Do you know what a good time someone has to be to get in a boat with them after you've

07:28.560 --> 07:30.880
 already gotten in one wreck?

07:30.880 --> 07:31.880
 Never get fooled again.

07:31.880 --> 07:32.880
 What was that line?

07:32.880 --> 07:34.360
 George Bush, never get fooled again.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.360
 Right.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.360
 Yes.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.800
 So if you're getting fooled again, you know, there's a reason for it, but he was, he was

07:38.800 --> 07:39.800
 a fun guy.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.800
 He did have a death wish.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.520
 The second boating accident, he grabbed me and said, you can't hang out with me anymore.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.520
 And I said, why?

07:44.520 --> 07:45.520
 He goes, I'm trying to kill myself.

07:45.520 --> 07:51.160
 And I was like, oh, and then I understood that like, oh, the fun under the fun lived

07:51.160 --> 07:57.600
 a very destructive person who not only was destructive, but wanted to die.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.960
 So speaking of fun people that want to die, I don't know if you're, we can go hunter as

08:01.960 --> 08:06.360
 Thompson, but Charles Bukowski, I don't know if you're aware of the guy.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.360
 I'm aware of him.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
 Sure.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.360
 I've read some of his stuff.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.600
 So his tombstone says, I just wanted to ask you a question about it.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.560
 His tombstone says, don't try.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.800
 Interesting.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.920
 What do you think about that advice as a way to approach life?

08:19.920 --> 08:24.960
 I think for many people, it's a good, good advice because the people that are going to

08:24.960 --> 08:29.480
 try will do anyway, and the people that need to be told, there's a whole cottage industry

08:29.480 --> 08:37.920
 now of motivational speakers and life coaches and gurus that tell people that they all have

08:37.920 --> 08:45.400
 to own their own business and be their own boss and be a disruptor and get into industries.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.640
 That's incredibly unrealistic for most people.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.400
 Most people are not suited for that.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.120
 And the Gary V's of the world that tell everybody that they should just hustle and grind and

08:54.120 --> 08:55.120
 hustle and grind.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.400
 They're very light on the specifics of what they should actually do.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.400
 Yeah.

08:58.400 --> 09:02.080
 I think a lot of people, that's not horrible advice to give to a lot of people.

09:02.080 --> 09:07.840
 I think my generation got horrible advice from our parents, from our teachers, and that

09:07.840 --> 09:12.280
 advice was follow your dreams, and that was it, by the way.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.560
 There was no like, what are your dreams?

09:14.560 --> 09:15.760
 Are they realistic?

09:15.760 --> 09:17.360
 What happens when they don't work out?

09:17.360 --> 09:18.880
 Will your dreams make you happy?

09:18.880 --> 09:20.880
 Are your dreams real?

09:20.880 --> 09:22.720
 Do they exist on earth?

09:22.720 --> 09:27.240
 When you follow your dreams, you can be anything you want to be.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.240
 Horrible advice.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.240
 Yeah.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.240
 Horrible advice.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.800
 Worst advice you could ever give a generation of people.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.800
 Really.

09:32.800 --> 09:33.800
 Truly.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.120
 I mean, think about it.

09:35.120 --> 09:39.600
 If you were talking to somebody and you were trying to make them succeed, are there any

09:39.600 --> 09:44.480
 two worst pieces of advice to give them then?

09:44.480 --> 09:48.840
 Follow your dreams and you can be anything you want to be.

09:48.840 --> 09:53.200
 Those to me are the two most destructive pieces of information I've ever heard.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.840
 So let me push back because...

09:54.840 --> 09:55.840
 Oh, that's fair.

09:55.840 --> 09:56.840
 This is...

09:56.840 --> 09:57.840
 Many people do.

09:57.840 --> 10:01.880
 So yeah, this is like a rigorous journalistic interview.

10:01.880 --> 10:05.560
 Larry King, by the way, passed away today, so I'm taking over the...

10:05.560 --> 10:06.560
 It's very sad.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.560
 I'm carrying the...

10:07.560 --> 10:08.560
 Very sad.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.560
 R.I.P. King.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.560
 Yeah.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.560
 What was I even going to say?

10:11.560 --> 10:18.800
 Oh, let me push back on the follow your dream thing is I come from an immigrant family where

10:18.800 --> 10:26.120
 I was always working extremely hard at stuff, like in a stupid way.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.120
 There's something about me that loves hitting my head against the wall over and over and

10:29.120 --> 10:32.520
 over until either my head breaks or the wall breaks.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.280
 Just like I love that dedication for no purpose whatsoever.

10:36.280 --> 10:40.120
 It's like the mouse that's stuck in a cage or whatever.

10:40.120 --> 10:47.440
 And everybody always told me, my family, the people around me, the sort of the epitome

10:47.440 --> 10:54.760
 of what I could achieve is to be kind of a stable job, the old lawyer, doctor.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.800
 In my case, it's like scientists and so on.

10:57.800 --> 11:06.520
 But I had these dreams at this fire about love robots and that nobody ever gave me permission

11:06.520 --> 11:08.320
 to pursue those dreams.

11:08.320 --> 11:12.160
 I know you're supposed to grab it yourself, nobody's supposed to give you permission,

11:12.160 --> 11:19.040
 but there's something about just people saying, fuck what everyone else thinks, like giving

11:19.040 --> 11:23.840
 you permission, a parent or somebody like that saying, do your own thing, go become

11:23.840 --> 11:28.640
 an actor, go become like, do the crazy thing you're not supposed to do, an artist, go build

11:28.640 --> 11:32.160
 a company, quit school, all that kind of stuff.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.400
 Yes, sure.

11:33.400 --> 11:38.680
 That's to push back against the follow your dreams as bad advice.

11:38.680 --> 11:46.320
 In mass, if you were to look at statistically how few people that works out for, let's be

11:46.320 --> 11:47.320
 very honest.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.320
 This is very true, yeah.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.320
 Be very honest.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.200
 So I mean, yeah, if you're going to go be an actor, hey, I was broke for 10 years before

11:52.200 --> 11:55.800
 I was making money as a comedian, I get it.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.800
 I didn't need Gary Vaynerchuk to tell me to follow my thing, right?

11:59.800 --> 12:06.840
 And here's the other thing, I was kind of funny and a lot of things were in my favor of being

12:06.840 --> 12:07.840
 a comedian.

12:07.840 --> 12:12.040
 I had this kind of crazy fucked up life, I had a lot of stories, I had exhausted, I

12:12.040 --> 12:16.960
 was willing to fail, I had failed before, I was broke, I didn't care about being broke,

12:16.960 --> 12:23.240
 I knew how to be broke, I was shameless to a degree, I would get on a stage night after

12:23.240 --> 12:29.120
 night and be laughed at, I had a high threshold for being embarrassed, I had a high threshold

12:29.120 --> 12:31.880
 for people thinking that I was scumbag, right?

12:31.880 --> 12:35.240
 And showing up at family parties and being like, yeah, I still really don't have a job

12:35.240 --> 12:41.200
 and I'm just, I work at comedy clubs, kind of, and I get booked when I can.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.920
 And I was suited for it.

12:44.920 --> 12:52.800
 There's this idea that people can just roam around the world injecting themselves into

12:52.800 --> 12:58.240
 other things they have no aptitude for at all and will that happen?

12:58.240 --> 13:03.120
 A small percentage of people might be able to do that, but the vast majority of people

13:03.120 --> 13:08.560
 have something they might key into that they're meant to do, like you loved robots, you loved

13:08.560 --> 13:12.920
 technology, and you found a place in that world where you thrive.

13:12.920 --> 13:16.240
 But I think many people, a lot of people love robots, right?

13:16.240 --> 13:18.360
 So a lot of people think everything you do is interesting.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.400
 I think your shit is fascinating.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.520
 I watch you or podcast and I think it's very interesting.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.320
 I have no place in your world.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.320
 You know what I mean?

13:27.320 --> 13:28.920
 I have no place in that world.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.960
 I don't like remedial math.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.360
 I don't like community college math.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.440
 I think it's a waste of my time.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.440
 What do you think about a robot?

13:38.440 --> 13:40.600
 Would you ever buy a robot for your home?

13:40.600 --> 13:41.840
 Yes.

13:41.840 --> 13:42.840
 What will it do?

13:42.840 --> 13:44.720
 I'll be a companion, a friend.

13:44.720 --> 13:45.720
 Oh, yeah.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.640
 I mean, I would like to start replacing friends and family with robots immediately.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.640
 Okay.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.640
 I mean, truly, truly.

13:50.640 --> 13:56.720
 I mean, I'm not even kidding, like, I would like to have a Thanksgiving with four robots.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.200
 I'm dead serious.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.160
 Well, are they into QAnon?

14:00.160 --> 14:05.920
 Like, are the robots, when do the robots start going crazy?

14:05.920 --> 14:06.920
 That's my question.

14:06.920 --> 14:11.000
 It's like, how long do the robots live with me before they are also a problem and I got

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
 to replace them?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.520
 You know what I mean?

14:13.520 --> 14:14.960
 You're going to indoctrinate the robot.

14:14.960 --> 14:15.960
 Yeah.

14:15.960 --> 14:19.040
 The robot's going to call me like my aunt doesn't talk about coronavirus for an hour every

14:19.040 --> 14:23.120
 morning and tell me everyone in America who's died of coronavirus.

14:23.120 --> 14:31.280
 One of the things I enjoy in life is how terrified people like you, a huge fan, by the way, get

14:31.280 --> 14:32.280
 a robot.

14:32.280 --> 14:39.840
 Well, I am concerned about AI like completely getting rid of the need for human beings because

14:39.840 --> 14:45.680
 human beings, I mean, you go out in the street and you go, so few of these people are necessary.

14:45.680 --> 14:51.120
 Even now, even now you look at people and you go, they're hanging on by a thread, right?

14:51.120 --> 14:55.320
 And you can just imagine how many jobs are going to get replaced, how many industries

14:55.320 --> 15:01.600
 are going to be completely remade with AI and the pace of change worries me a little bit

15:01.600 --> 15:07.600
 because we do a very bad job in this country of mitigation when we have problems.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
 We don't do a great job.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.200
 We did not do a great job with COVID, right?

15:11.200 --> 15:12.200
 We don't do a good job.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.280
 It's just something we don't do well.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.920
 We kind of, we're good in booms and busts.

15:15.920 --> 15:19.520
 We're good when it's good and we're actually, we kind of know how to kind of like, hey,

15:19.520 --> 15:20.520
 we're bottomed out.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.520
 We're like a gambling addict in this country.

15:23.520 --> 15:27.640
 We know what it feels like to be outside of an OTB at 9 AM drinking coffee and smoking

15:27.640 --> 15:31.800
 cigarettes going, I'm going to build it back and we know what it's like to win.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.760
 But anything in between, it seems not that great.

15:35.760 --> 15:41.840
 So to me, it feels like, are we going to be able to help people that are displaced and

15:41.840 --> 15:47.760
 that have their jobs taken by, I mean, do you not fear sort of a world where you have

15:47.760 --> 15:53.720
 a lot of artificial intelligence replacing workers and then what happens?

15:53.720 --> 15:56.240
 There's a lot of fears around artificial intelligence.

15:56.240 --> 15:59.640
 One of them is, yes, displacement of jobs, workers.

15:59.640 --> 16:07.720
 That's technology in general, that's just any kind of new innovations, displaced jobs.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.360
 I'm less worried about that.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.920
 I'm more worried about other impacts of artificial intelligence.

16:12.920 --> 16:17.960
 For example, the nature of our discourse, the effects of algorithms on the way we communicate

16:17.960 --> 16:23.240
 with each other, the spread of information, what that information looks like, the creation

16:23.240 --> 16:24.960
 of silos, all that kind of stuff.

16:24.960 --> 16:33.080
 I think that would just make worse the effects that the displacement of jobs has.

16:33.080 --> 16:38.720
 I think ultimately, I have a hope that technology creates more opportunities than it destroys.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.600
 I hope so too.

16:40.600 --> 16:50.160
 In that sense, AI to me is an exciting possibility, but the challenges this world presents will

16:50.160 --> 16:56.040
 create divisions, will create chaos and so on, so I'm more focused on the way we deal

16:56.040 --> 17:00.920
 as a society with that chaos, the way we talk to each other, creating the platform that's

17:00.920 --> 17:01.920
 healthy for that.

17:01.920 --> 17:08.760
 Now, as a comedian, creator, whatever you want to call it, people that put out content,

17:08.760 --> 17:11.440
 the gatekeepers are now algorithmic.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.520
 They are almost AI ready.

17:13.520 --> 17:21.960
 If you are a person that puts out YouTube videos, podcasts, whatever you're doing, it

17:21.960 --> 17:27.480
 used to be a guy in the back of the room with a cigar saying, I like you or get him out

17:27.480 --> 17:28.480
 of here.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.520
 Now, it's an algorithm you barely understand.

17:31.520 --> 17:35.600
 I've talked to people at YouTube, but I don't know if they understand the algorithm.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.600
 They don't.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.600
 They don't.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.600
 This is fascinating.

17:38.600 --> 17:42.240
 Because I speak to people at YouTube and I go, hey, man, what's going on here?

17:42.240 --> 17:46.600
 One of my episode titles of my podcast was called Knife Fight in Malibu.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.120
 It was about real estate.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.840
 And it was because of Realtor in Malibu.

17:50.840 --> 17:54.640
 I was trying to get a summer rental, which I can't really afford, but I don't think that's

17:54.640 --> 17:55.640
 a huge problem.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.760
 I follow my dreams.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.840
 So I called a Realtor and she said, listen, she goes, I don't know what the government

18:00.840 --> 18:04.560
 is saying, but she goes, it's a real knife fight out here, an old grizzled woman, real

18:04.560 --> 18:09.480
 Realtor canned skin, sick at the mouth, driving a Porsche, you know, it's a real knife fight

18:09.480 --> 18:10.480
 out here.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.600
 You know, her entire life had become real estate.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.000
 Her soul had been hollowed out.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
 Her kids hate her.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.800
 You know, no one's made her come in years, but it's just, she just loves heated kitchen

18:18.800 --> 18:20.320
 floors and fuses.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.320
 Fun.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.200
 She's a demon from hell and we need them.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.200
 Truly.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.200
 We're getting rid of them.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.360
 It's not good.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.120
 And she goes, it's a real knife fight out here.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.120
 So we put that in the episode title.

18:30.120 --> 18:33.560
 And of course, I guess some algorithm thought that we were showing like people stabbing

18:33.560 --> 18:37.800
 each other in a Wendy's and we got like demonetized.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.800
 Did we get demonetized?

18:38.800 --> 18:44.360
 We lost a lot of views because we were kicked out of whatever out like we're just kicked

18:44.360 --> 18:45.360
 out.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.360
 And I was asking YouTube about it.

18:46.360 --> 18:50.520
 They were kind of understanding it, but even the people that work there didn't truly seem

18:50.520 --> 18:51.920
 to understand the algorithm.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.400
 So can you explain to me how that works where they barely know what's going on?

18:55.400 --> 19:00.720
 No, they do not understand the full dynamics of the, the monster or the amazing thing that

19:00.720 --> 19:01.720
 they've created.

19:01.720 --> 19:06.000
 That's the amount of content that's being created is larger than anyone understands.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
 Right.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
 Like this is huge.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
 They can't deal with it.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.240
 The teams aren't large enough to deal with it.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.240
 There's like special cases.

19:13.240 --> 19:17.120
 So if you fall into the category of special cases, we can maybe talk about that like a

19:17.120 --> 19:21.600
 Donald Trump where you like actually have meetings about what to do with this particular

19:21.600 --> 19:22.600
 account.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.920
 But everything outside of that is all algorithms.

19:24.920 --> 19:31.120
 They get reported by people and they get like, if enough people report a particular video,

19:31.120 --> 19:36.840
 a particular tweet, it rises up to where humans look over it.

19:36.840 --> 19:45.600
 But the initial step of the reporting and the rising up to the human supervision is

19:45.600 --> 19:46.600
 done by algorithm.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.600
 And they don't understand the dynamics of that because we're talking about billions

19:49.600 --> 19:50.600
 of tweets.

19:50.600 --> 19:58.400
 We're talking about hundreds of thousands of hours of video uploaded every day.

19:58.400 --> 20:08.520
 Now the hilarity of it is that most of the YouTube algorithm is based on the title.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.520
 That's crazy.

20:09.520 --> 20:13.280
 And the description is a small contribution in terms of filtering, in terms of the knife

20:13.280 --> 20:15.080
 fight situation.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.160
 And that's all they can do.

20:17.160 --> 20:22.520
 They don't have algorithms at all that are able to process the content of the video.

20:22.520 --> 20:29.080
 So they try to also infer information based on if you're watching all of these QAnon videos

20:29.080 --> 20:35.760
 or something like that or Flat Earth videos and you also watch, are really excitedly watching

20:35.760 --> 20:39.600
 the whole knife fight in Malibu video.

20:39.600 --> 20:47.160
 That says that increases the chance that the knife fight is a dangerous video for society

20:47.160 --> 20:48.160
 or something like that.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.160
 Interesting.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.160
 Wow.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.160
 Based on their contribution.

20:51.160 --> 20:55.440
 Yeah, because I watch QAnon and Flat Earth videos to ridicule them.

20:55.440 --> 20:56.440
 Right.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.440
 You know what I mean?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.640
 I watch these videos and I make fun of them on my show.

20:59.640 --> 21:00.640
 Yeah.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.480
 But what's interesting is if I then go watch something else, I'm increasing the likelihood

21:04.480 --> 21:07.880
 that that video is going to get looked at as potentially subversive or dangerous.

21:07.880 --> 21:08.880
 Exactly.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.880
 That's what.

21:09.880 --> 21:14.320
 So they make decisions about who you are, who you are as a human being as a watcher,

21:14.320 --> 21:18.080
 the visual user based on the clusters of videos you're in.

21:18.080 --> 21:23.560
 But those clusters are not manually determined, they're automatically clustered.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.720
 So weird.

21:24.720 --> 21:29.520
 We have titles where they got upset about it, I don't even understand.

21:29.520 --> 21:34.120
 We had a title that was so innocuous in my opinion and the title of the episode was called

21:34.120 --> 21:42.640
 Bomb Disney World and I was asking people to consider bombing Disney World and YouTube

21:42.640 --> 21:44.160
 got angry at that.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.720
 So you don't know why.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.720
 You can never understand.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.080
 You could have said Disney World is the bomb.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.080
 Right.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.080
 Right.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.080
 It's just rearranging.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.080
 That's what it probably meant.

21:53.080 --> 21:58.600
 I wasn't saying to do it, but I was saying let's start thinking about plans to do it.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.880
 Not let's do it, but let's get in the mind.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.760
 Let's change the conversation.

22:03.760 --> 22:06.480
 I think it's very interesting because as a comedian, you don't want to live in that

22:06.480 --> 22:09.600
 world of worrying about algorithms, you don't want to worry about the platforming and shadow

22:09.600 --> 22:10.600
 banning.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.360
 I mean, all these conversations that I've had with other comedians about shadow banning,

22:13.360 --> 22:14.360
 I mean, it's hilarious.

22:14.360 --> 22:15.360
 We all call each other.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.800
 I think I'm being shadow banned.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.320
 Are you being shadow banned?

22:18.320 --> 22:23.440
 And nobody knew what that word was a month ago, a year ago, but everyone now is convinced

22:23.440 --> 22:27.120
 that everything they do that isn't succeeding is being shadow banned.

22:27.120 --> 22:34.200
 So it's this new paranoia, this algorithmic paranoia now that we all kind of have because

22:34.200 --> 22:41.480
 there are genuine instances of people being taken out of an algorithm, rightly or wrongly,

22:41.480 --> 22:42.920
 however you want to believe.

22:42.920 --> 22:47.600
 But then there are also things that just don't perform as well for a myriad of reasons.

22:47.600 --> 22:52.160
 And then we're all saying like, well, they're against me, they're shutting me down and you

22:52.160 --> 22:55.280
 don't know if that's true or not.

22:55.280 --> 23:00.000
 What do you think about this moment in history, which was really troubling to me?

23:00.000 --> 23:09.600
 We could talk about several troubling aspects, but one is Amazon removing Parler from AWS.

23:09.600 --> 23:13.840
 To me, that was the most clearly troubling.

23:13.840 --> 23:21.400
 It felt like it created a more dangerous world when the infrastructure on which you have

23:21.400 --> 23:29.040
 competing medium of communications now puts its finger on the scale, now influences who

23:29.040 --> 23:30.960
 wins and who loses.

23:30.960 --> 23:31.960
 Absolutely.

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
 You're right.

23:32.960 --> 23:37.760
 And what you're always told is like, if you don't like Twitter, create your own service.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.200
 Or if you don't like something, you can do your own thing.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.840
 Or if you are...

23:42.840 --> 23:47.440
 And basically, because you have to be in business with one of five companies, I think it's like

23:47.440 --> 23:51.480
 Amazon, Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter, whatever.

23:51.480 --> 23:55.440
 Amazon puts everything on the cloud, Google and YouTube.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.560
 It's all basically the SEO and the advertising and you get to get your name out there.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.400
 You don't want to be buried.

24:00.400 --> 24:04.080
 Because you have to do business with it, it's a cartel of these companies, you understand

24:04.080 --> 24:08.040
 it better than anybody, that you are prevented, truly.

24:08.040 --> 24:12.280
 And I think whatever you think about Parler, whatever you think about what people are saying

24:12.280 --> 24:19.160
 on Parler, whatever you think about Alex Jones, whatever you thought about Millenianopolis,

24:19.160 --> 24:25.600
 the state has an interest in and has always had an interest in crushing dissent.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.080
 This is what the state has done.

24:27.080 --> 24:34.640
 This is how they retain the power they have by eliminating dissent where they can.

24:34.640 --> 24:39.400
 Now because you don't have three broadcast networks anymore and a handful of newspapers

24:39.400 --> 24:47.160
 that were all run, by the way, by people that had been either compromised or happily going

24:47.160 --> 24:53.680
 with the program and you have this wild west of the internet, people like me, people that

24:53.680 --> 24:59.480
 make, I make funny content that I hope is funny, but a lot of it is wild and crazy.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.000
 I say a lot of wild and crazy things.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
 They're very funny.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.120
 I say a lot of wild and crazy things about powerful people.

25:06.120 --> 25:09.560
 You mock the powerful in there by bringing them down a notch.

25:09.560 --> 25:16.600
 We'll probably talk about it, but humor is one of the tools to balance the powers in

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
 society.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.600
 Well, sure.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.680
 And to make people feel better about things and to whatever the case may be.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.360
 That's my goal is to kind of like, hey, people have had a shitty day.

25:25.360 --> 25:29.360
 If this video or podcast makes you laugh, that's great.

25:29.360 --> 25:33.200
 I think that it won't ever, it was never going to stop at Alex Jones.

25:33.200 --> 25:37.640
 Not that I think he should have been taking off everything the way he was, but this keeps

25:37.640 --> 25:42.760
 going until we have sanitized all of social media.

25:42.760 --> 25:47.080
 And what they really wanted to be is what Instagram is kind of becoming, which is a

25:47.080 --> 25:52.320
 marketplace of you could just go and buy sneakers, go buy a sweatshirt, go buy jeans,

25:52.320 --> 25:54.040
 go buy this, go buy that.

25:54.040 --> 25:58.720
 And the idea of the free exchange of information seems to be the old internet and it seems

25:58.720 --> 26:04.400
 the new internet seems to be hyper and I'm a capitalist, but this seems to be like hyper

26:04.400 --> 26:09.600
 capitalist in the sense of like, they only want you consuming things and they don't want

26:09.600 --> 26:12.200
 you thinking too much.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.520
 And that seems to be where it's heading.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.760
 I've even seen that with Instagram where it's like everything on Instagram is not like buy

26:16.760 --> 26:17.760
 a sweatshirt.

26:17.760 --> 26:18.760
 Yeah.

26:18.760 --> 26:25.640
 And I'm like, all right, man, hey, man, if I want a sweatshirt, I'll get it, relax.

26:25.640 --> 26:35.840
 Just every ad seems to be encouraging consumption, but very few things seem geared towards, hey,

26:35.840 --> 26:39.800
 let's have a dialogue or let's, and not that Instagram is ever great for that, but if everything

26:39.800 --> 26:44.400
 is geared now towards content on Instagram, a lot of it seems geared towards shopping.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.000
 See, I don't know, that's an interesting point.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.320
 I don't know if the consumerism that capitalism leads to is necessarily gets in the way of

26:52.320 --> 26:53.800
 nuanced conversation.

26:53.800 --> 26:59.560
 I feel like you could still sell Tim Dillon sweatshirts and have a difficult nuanced conversation

26:59.560 --> 27:05.120
 or mock the current president, the previous president, mock the powerful, all that kind

27:05.120 --> 27:06.120
 of stuff.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.120
 Yeah, we try.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.120
 We try to balance that.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.120
 Do you have sweatshirts?

27:09.120 --> 27:10.120
 We do.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.520
 Are they on sale now, fake business?

27:12.520 --> 27:16.440
 We do fake business sweatshirt with the Enron logo fake business because I like, I do fake

27:16.440 --> 27:17.440
 business all the time.

27:17.440 --> 27:21.080
 It would be nice if you talk about Alex Jones, if you plug the sweatshirt during that conversation.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.080
 Yeah, we'll do that.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.080
 Absolutely.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.080
 Yeah.

27:24.080 --> 27:30.840
 But what I tend to worry about with, I see social media and technology existing to flatten

27:30.840 --> 27:32.360
 society.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.560
 It makes people very boring.

27:34.560 --> 27:38.920
 All of the experiences kids have right now are online.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.640
 Many of their closest friendships are online.

27:40.640 --> 27:42.960
 Their first relationships are online.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.800
 The culture is very homogenous.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.120
 And that's, I think it's eliminating characters.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.800
 It's eliminating interesting people.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.320
 It's making people into AI.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.320
 All of their tastes.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.320
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:54.320 --> 27:55.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:55.320 --> 27:56.320
 That's right.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.320
 Charles Bukowski as well.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.320
 Let's not get crazy.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.320
 It's not there yet.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.320
 Right?

28:00.320 --> 28:03.920
 I mean, the $75,000 dog is not doing anything.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.880
 So we're not there yet.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.280
 Listen, I get why you like AI so much.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.440
 I hate people too.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
 And I'm very amenable to AI.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.880
 And I agree with you.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.760
 Listen, I think the future, we got to get everyone out of here.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.760
 I'm with you on that.

28:16.760 --> 28:17.760
 So don't think I'm...

28:17.760 --> 28:18.760
 I love people.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.880
 He's manipulating my mind and my...

28:20.880 --> 28:25.320
 That's why the flash of light in your eyes when you talked about that dog was so much

28:25.320 --> 28:27.200
 more than any person.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.200
 And I get it, by the way.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.200
 You're right.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.200
 I love people, but if we...

28:30.200 --> 28:31.200
 They're not excited.

28:31.200 --> 28:35.880
 If it could just use robots to kill most of them, I think that would be good for society.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.240
 I'm with that too.

28:37.240 --> 28:40.920
 But I think that social media flattens people.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.760
 Flattening the personalities of characters.

28:42.760 --> 28:43.760
 The personalities of people, man.

28:43.760 --> 28:44.760
 And it's just...

28:44.760 --> 28:45.760
 When's the last time...

28:45.760 --> 28:52.320
 I like the idea of somebody showing up to high school with a backpack and taking out

28:52.320 --> 28:56.720
 an old CD and being like, hey, man, here's this band you've never heard of that I love

28:56.720 --> 28:57.720
 or whatever.

28:57.720 --> 28:58.720
 You got to get into this.

28:58.720 --> 28:59.720
 And I'm like...

28:59.720 --> 29:00.720
 When I talk to...

29:00.720 --> 29:02.520
 I have friends that have younger brothers and everything.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.680
 And I know that the dominant culture was always dominant.

29:04.680 --> 29:05.680
 I'm not an idiot.

29:05.680 --> 29:11.960
 But I feel like it's harder to be unique and original now because so much of what's promoted

29:11.960 --> 29:17.760
 is just this way to kind of corral people into believing and thinking a certain set

29:17.760 --> 29:20.920
 of ideals that's constantly shifting and evolving.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.440
 And people are just caught up in that.

29:23.440 --> 29:27.200
 And to me, it gets very boring very quickly.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.000
 I hate being bored.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
 That's what it is.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.240
 I don't know what to do with that because at the same time, podcasts are really popular,

29:33.240 --> 29:38.480
 long form podcasts are really popular and people are hungry for those kinds of conversations.

29:38.480 --> 29:44.000
 There's a lot of dangerous ideas, quote, unquote, flowing, being spread around through

29:44.000 --> 29:46.560
 podcasts, meaning just like debates.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.560
 Correct.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.160
 You know, so that's still popular.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.560
 So I don't know what to...

29:50.560 --> 29:51.560
 I agree with you.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.560
 That gives me hope, I guess.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.560
 I hope so too.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.880
 And like I said, I look at the negative a lot because that's what I usually make fun

29:56.880 --> 30:00.080
 of, but there's a lot of positive stuff happening too.

30:00.080 --> 30:04.720
 Let's talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

30:04.720 --> 30:09.040
 So you've gotten a chance to talk to him while you were on the Joe Rogan experience.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.520
 I've been on Alex's show.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.520
 I've talked...

30:11.520 --> 30:12.880
 I've had Alex on my show.

30:12.880 --> 30:18.120
 I've talked to Alex for three hours in front of, I guess it was maybe like 15 million people,

30:18.120 --> 30:19.120
 right, on Joe's show.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.640
 It was a really wild conversation.

30:20.640 --> 30:26.120
 I think it was one of the coolest moments in broadcasting that clearly that I've ever

30:26.120 --> 30:27.120
 been a part of.

30:27.120 --> 30:31.280
 But I think it goes in the lexicon of like, these are big podcasts.

30:31.280 --> 30:35.200
 I think it's one of the biggest podcasts a week before the election, Alex Jones.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.560
 I'm really grateful that Joe gave me the opportunity to be there.

30:38.560 --> 30:41.440
 And it was just an amazing conversation to watch.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.560
 What was the shirt you wore, Jillian Mackle?

30:43.560 --> 30:44.560
 Free Just Lane.

30:44.560 --> 30:48.800
 It was a fun joke that no one in tech got because we all know how funny they are.

30:48.800 --> 30:55.240
 But the tech writers, which is mainly blue haired people whose goal in life is to find

30:55.240 --> 30:57.480
 things to give them orgasms with, you know...

30:57.480 --> 31:01.000
 If you want to dye your hair blue, it's your choice, I respect it.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.800
 But is it your choice?

31:02.800 --> 31:05.720
 But at the end of the day, it's like, you know, all the tech writers, like a lot of people

31:05.720 --> 31:06.720
 just...

31:06.720 --> 31:07.720
 And I'm not...

31:07.720 --> 31:08.720
 I'm just maligning tech unfairly.

31:08.720 --> 31:12.760
 But a lot of people that sense as a humor, we're like, he's advocating for human traffic.

31:12.760 --> 31:16.640
 I'm like, it's clearly a joke because we're coming off the believe all women.

31:16.640 --> 31:17.880
 We're coming off that.

31:17.880 --> 31:22.880
 It's very funny to just say, Free Just Lane, hey man, believe all women, like it's just...

31:22.880 --> 31:28.680
 Our politics and our public sphere is so schizophrenic right now that when you point that out, people

31:28.680 --> 31:31.840
 are going to be angry with you, but that was a fun shirt to wear.

31:31.840 --> 31:38.160
 But on Alex, you know, I was one of the people that found him really entertaining that the

31:38.160 --> 31:45.080
 same kind of thing as Bakowski, these kinds of personalities that are wild, crazy, full

31:45.080 --> 31:49.360
 of ideas, they don't have to be grounded in truth at all, or they can be grounded in

31:49.360 --> 31:51.360
 truth a little bit.

31:51.360 --> 31:55.760
 He's just playing with ideas, like a jazz musician, screaming sometimes.

31:55.760 --> 32:01.240
 Obviously, he has some demons, sometimes he's super angry for no reason whatsoever.

32:01.240 --> 32:04.800
 It's some weird thing that he's constructed in his own head.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.320
 Sometimes he's super loving and peaceful, especially lately that I've heard him.

32:08.320 --> 32:12.680
 I don't know if you've seen with him with Michael Malice where he's doing a, like Malice

32:12.680 --> 32:18.160
 was doing, like, well, telling Alex Jones, I love you, Alex, you know, just this loving

32:18.160 --> 32:21.040
 kindness, softness and kindness underneath it all.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.640
 I don't know what to make of any of it.

32:22.640 --> 32:27.420
 And then there's this huge number of people that tell me that Alex Jones is dangerous

32:27.420 --> 32:28.920
 for society.

32:28.920 --> 32:29.920
 Right.

32:29.920 --> 32:30.920
 So what do you do with that?

32:30.920 --> 32:32.400
 Do you think he's dangerous for society?

32:32.400 --> 32:37.920
 Do you think he is one of the sort of entertaining personalities of our time that shouldn't be

32:37.920 --> 32:39.720
 suppressed or somewhere in between?

32:39.720 --> 32:43.840
 I don't think that Alex, per se, is dangerous for society.

32:43.840 --> 32:50.200
 I think the greater danger for society comes, again, from stifling all dissent, right?

32:50.200 --> 32:56.360
 All like anybody with a voice that uses it, that critiques the government and putting

32:56.360 --> 33:01.120
 all of those people in a category and getting rid of them is incredibly dangerous to me.

33:01.120 --> 33:06.640
 More so, I think the biggest problem that Alex has ever had was when he questioned the

33:06.640 --> 33:08.360
 Sandy Hook shooting.

33:08.360 --> 33:13.320
 And that really was, because it really is this identifiable incident that you can look

33:13.320 --> 33:17.760
 at where it did get away from him and a lot of his fans who, the people that are attracted

33:17.760 --> 33:22.000
 to conspiracy stuff, and I have some of those fans, some of them are really smart people,

33:22.000 --> 33:23.480
 some of them are mentally unwell.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.760
 A lot of them happen to be mentally unwell.

33:25.760 --> 33:29.560
 So when you have a fan base of people where some of them are mentally unwell and you are

33:29.560 --> 33:34.240
 questioning, you know, tragic events, okay?

33:34.240 --> 33:35.240
 And Alex was right about Epstein.

33:35.240 --> 33:38.440
 He was right about a lot of things and he's got no credit for that.

33:38.440 --> 33:42.880
 And I understand that this, sometimes when you write about 10 things and you're wrong

33:42.880 --> 33:48.960
 about something and the thing you're wrong about is so offensive to people, you're never

33:48.960 --> 33:51.960
 going to get any credit for being right, even though you were right more than when you

33:51.960 --> 33:52.960
 were wrong.

33:52.960 --> 33:58.560
 The problem was a lot of his fans who were crazy stalked, harassed these families and

33:58.560 --> 34:02.680
 accused them of being actors and accused them of like faking their children's death.

34:02.680 --> 34:06.320
 It was this horrific experience.

34:06.320 --> 34:15.480
 Alex is tired of that and how much he inspired that by what he did on his show, I don't know

34:15.480 --> 34:20.680
 because I haven't watched hours and hours of that particular thing, like with the whole

34:20.680 --> 34:22.680
 Sandy Hook thing.

34:22.680 --> 34:24.680
 If you listen to him, he says, I really covered it.

34:24.680 --> 34:26.560
 I kind of covered it and moved on.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.200
 Other people go, no, he spent a long time on it.

34:29.200 --> 34:33.560
 But that's the real danger of going into that territory over and over again.

34:33.560 --> 34:37.600
 Everything is a false flag or everything's fake.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.520
 I think Alex has actually been kind of reasonable.

34:39.520 --> 34:45.120
 He's resisted a lot of the politics of racial resentment on the alt right, for example.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.280
 He's resisted that.

34:46.280 --> 34:51.320
 He's resisted the anti Semitic currents of a lot of that politics.

34:51.320 --> 34:56.320
 He's resisted a lot of the virulently anti trans or anti gay stuff.

34:56.320 --> 35:00.800
 Now, he does dip his toe into the water of the culture wars, of course he does.

35:00.800 --> 35:07.240
 But I've never really seen him, or that could be wrong about this, embrace white nationalism

35:07.240 --> 35:08.480
 or identitarianism.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.400
 I've never seen him really go anti Semitic.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.400
 I've never seen him take that route.

35:12.400 --> 35:16.600
 When I grew up, and I would turn him on every now and then, he was talking about NAFTA, the

35:16.600 --> 35:22.840
 WTO, he's talking about 911, he was talking about the world trade organizations and a

35:22.840 --> 35:27.080
 lot of these big conferences, whether it was the Bilderberg group, whether it was Bohemian

35:27.080 --> 35:30.760
 Grove, which he infiltrated, and he was talking about, hey, here are the most powerful

35:30.760 --> 35:32.880
 people in the world, and here's what they're doing.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.320
 And here's how it affects you.

35:34.320 --> 35:38.000
 And that was interesting to me, because no one else was really talking about it, except

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
 Alex Jones.

35:39.000 --> 35:45.320
 Occasionally, Art Bell on WABC, you'd listen to him at night, right?

35:45.320 --> 35:50.160
 I think Alex became very controversial when he decided to back Donald Trump.

35:50.160 --> 35:54.520
 And then he has a considerable following and a considerable audience that he was then able

35:54.520 --> 36:00.360
 to marshal in the direction of supporting Donald Trump.

36:00.360 --> 36:05.600
 That was when the spotlight, because then he was talking to Trump, Trump did his show.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.360
 Alex Jones just got bigger, right?

36:07.360 --> 36:08.360
 And he blew up.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.360
 That's the term, right?

36:09.360 --> 36:10.360
 He blew up.

36:10.360 --> 36:14.640
 Like, he had the good, he put out the good HBO special, whatever you want to call it.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.120
 He has a hit song.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.120
 He blew up.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.280
 And then people started looking at the things that he was associated with.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.120
 The Sandy Hook thing is a blemish on his record.

36:22.120 --> 36:26.000
 I do believe he regrets it, but again, I do see the point of the families who are like,

36:26.000 --> 36:27.680
 dude, fuck this guy forever.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.520
 This is the worst thing I ever went through.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.000
 It's a very tough...

36:32.000 --> 36:35.640
 I understand the people that say that.

36:35.640 --> 36:40.280
 I understand and I understand the people that go, when you coordinate, when you have tech

36:40.280 --> 36:44.240
 companies that act in a coordinated manner to just get rid of someone, they don't have

36:44.240 --> 36:50.040
 any way to defend themselves, it's a little terrifying when you think about that power

36:50.040 --> 36:53.520
 being abused and how wouldn't it be?

36:53.520 --> 36:57.080
 Do you think he should have not have been banned from all these platforms?

36:57.080 --> 36:58.360
 I don't think...

36:58.360 --> 37:03.160
 I do think that if you are a private company, right, I do think, and this is where you run

37:03.160 --> 37:08.040
 into this problem, I don't know if these tech companies were government utilities, would

37:08.040 --> 37:10.960
 that decrease people's likelihood of being banned?

37:10.960 --> 37:12.920
 I don't know, right?

37:12.920 --> 37:19.720
 So I understand the benefit of them being treated like public utilities and people thinking

37:19.720 --> 37:21.880
 they have the right to a Twitter.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.760
 I've never...

37:23.760 --> 37:25.320
 I don't know, I have very little confidence.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.360
 I mean, the government is trying to roll out a vaccine in California and we vaccinated

37:28.360 --> 37:32.760
 like five people, I mean, in terms of what we need to do in the state, right?

37:32.760 --> 37:38.120
 So maybe if it was a government utility, I do think someone like Alex...

37:38.120 --> 37:40.760
 There should be some process.

37:40.760 --> 37:44.360
 So if you're going to get rid of someone, they should have a way to defend themselves.

37:44.360 --> 37:53.600
 There should be more democratic process that you can go through than just being unilaterally

37:53.600 --> 37:54.600
 taken off something.

37:54.600 --> 37:58.840
 But like, then you run into the, you're like, am I going to say that everyone deserves...

37:58.840 --> 38:02.440
 No, if you're threatening or harassing people or threatening to kill them, publishing their

38:02.440 --> 38:03.440
 private information.

38:03.440 --> 38:07.720
 If you're committing crimes on these platforms, obviously the people that own these platforms

38:07.720 --> 38:10.560
 are going to be like, we're not going to allow this to happen.

38:10.560 --> 38:14.360
 So I understand that there is a line, right?

38:14.360 --> 38:15.360
 There is some...

38:15.360 --> 38:19.240
 Like people that say there's no line aren't really thinking, like there is a line.

38:19.240 --> 38:20.240
 I just...

38:20.240 --> 38:25.080
 That line seems to be moving all the time and it seems to be a very hard thing to police.

38:25.080 --> 38:28.360
 But I don't think you can remove a guy off everything.

38:28.360 --> 38:31.600
 And then also bank accounts won't give him debit cards or credit cards.

38:31.600 --> 38:35.320
 I don't know if you talked to him about that, but like, you know, there were financial institutions

38:35.320 --> 38:38.080
 that were refusing to let him park his money there.

38:38.080 --> 38:44.320
 So I mean, it really does get pretty terrifying pretty quickly.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.760
 Probably without any transparency from those companies.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.760
 See, right?

38:47.760 --> 38:54.000
 It feels like there should be a process of just having for him to defend himself or...

38:54.000 --> 38:59.320
 I think there needs to be a process for people to defend themselves.

38:59.320 --> 39:03.440
 Every day I wake up and I go, is something I said in a video going to get taken out of

39:03.440 --> 39:08.200
 context, is somebody going to get angry, is somebody going to be, you know, I say wild

39:08.200 --> 39:09.320
 stuff because that's what makes me laugh.

39:09.320 --> 39:12.320
 That's what makes my friends laugh and that's what makes my audience laugh.

39:12.320 --> 39:18.800
 So I never, ever, people, you know, whatever political side you come down on, I think if

39:18.800 --> 39:26.280
 you make your living speaking, it's always interesting to me if you are pro to the platform.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.520
 That's odd.

39:27.520 --> 39:35.040
 It's interesting to consider kind of a jury context to where, you know, there's transparency

39:35.040 --> 39:42.120
 about why you're a video about bombing a Disney world might be taken down, like it gets taken

39:42.120 --> 39:47.960
 down and then there is, it's almost like creating a little court case, a mini court case and

39:47.960 --> 39:53.760
 not in the legal sense, but in the public sphere and then people should be able to have,

39:53.760 --> 39:58.600
 you know, you pick representatives of our current society and have a discussion about

39:58.600 --> 40:00.840
 that and make a real vote.

40:00.840 --> 40:04.840
 You know, just have, like, jury to lock themselves up in a discussion.

40:04.840 --> 40:08.240
 That kind of process might be necessary.

40:08.240 --> 40:13.400
 Right now what happens is Twitter is completely, first of all, they're just mostly not aware

40:13.400 --> 40:14.880
 of everything they're doing.

40:14.880 --> 40:19.200
 There's too much stuff, but the stuff they're aware about, they make the decision and close

40:19.200 --> 40:26.240
 doors, the meetings and without any transparency to the rest of the company actually, but also

40:26.240 --> 40:29.600
 transparency to the rest of the world.

40:29.600 --> 40:36.280
 And so, and then all they say is we're doing, we're making decisions because the people,

40:36.280 --> 40:37.880
 they use things like violence.

40:37.880 --> 40:40.040
 So violence equals bad.

40:40.040 --> 40:44.720
 And if this person is quote unquote inciting violence, therefore that gives us enough reason

40:44.720 --> 40:48.840
 to ban them without any kind of process, it's, I mean, it's interesting.

40:48.840 --> 40:54.720
 And I'm torn in the whole thing if it was indeed, there's no transparency about it,

40:54.720 --> 41:01.680
 but if Parler was indeed inciting violence, like if there was brewing of violence, potential

41:01.680 --> 41:09.320
 violence where, you know, thousands of people might die because of some kind of riot, like

41:09.320 --> 41:17.440
 this is a scary thing about mob, about when a lot of people get together or good people,

41:17.440 --> 41:23.760
 like legitimately good people that love this country, that don't see enemies yet around

41:23.760 --> 41:24.760
 them.

41:24.760 --> 41:30.080
 But if they get excited together and there's guns involved, and then some cop gets nervous

41:30.080 --> 41:34.440
 and shoots one person, another person shoots the cop, and then there's a lot of shooting

41:34.440 --> 41:35.440
 involved.

41:35.440 --> 41:39.800
 And then it goes from five people dying in the Capitol to thousands of people dying in

41:39.800 --> 41:40.800
 the Capitol.

41:40.800 --> 41:46.640
 Well, in fairness to defend the people at the Capitol, they didn't shoot the cop.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.000
 They bludgeoned him to death with a fire extinguisher.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
 Yes.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.880
 So I do, I do want to just kind of put that out as a, as a defense of them.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.960
 Listen, I'm sure there was some wild shit going on on Parler.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.560
 And I think the problem, here's the problem, right?

42:00.560 --> 42:05.280
 There's a lot of people that just want to go on these sites and say they want to kill

42:05.280 --> 42:06.280
 everyone.

42:06.280 --> 42:07.280
 Yeah.

42:07.280 --> 42:11.760
 And the problem is, you know, at what point do you shut them all down?

42:11.760 --> 42:15.720
 Like I think a lot of people are just living in a world where they're powerless.

42:15.720 --> 42:17.560
 They don't have any political power.

42:17.560 --> 42:19.440
 They don't have any economic power, right?

42:19.440 --> 42:21.160
 They can't throw their money around.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.640
 They don't have healthcare.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.120
 Their job security isn't great.

42:26.120 --> 42:31.840
 They might be living in a community that doesn't have the resources they would like it to have.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.120
 They're not happy and thrilled.

42:34.120 --> 42:37.880
 And then they have these sites where they can go on and just say, man, I'd like to fucking

42:37.880 --> 42:44.040
 burn it all down and distinguishing a guy blowing off steam and saying wild stuff from

42:44.040 --> 42:48.360
 a genuine threat is a very hard thing to do.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.360
 You know?

42:49.360 --> 42:52.800
 Like I've threatened to kill, I got banned from Airbnb.

42:52.800 --> 42:58.040
 I threatened to kill the people that banned me comedically.

42:58.040 --> 42:59.040
 Yeah.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.040
 Comedically.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.040
 This is a joke.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.040
 I'm not going to kill you.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.040
 Yeah.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.760
 This is a joke because I'm blowing off steam and I'm angry.

43:04.760 --> 43:08.960
 Do you know how many people that my parents, like my dad's like, I'm going to fucking kill

43:08.960 --> 43:11.040
 this guy and my mom's like, I'm going to fucking kill.

43:11.040 --> 43:12.040
 Yeah.

43:12.040 --> 43:16.440
 I'm going to fucking kill each other, but it's, but none of it ever happened.

43:16.440 --> 43:22.760
 But we should be, I think you have to create a space for people to threaten to overthrow

43:22.760 --> 43:23.760
 the government.

43:23.760 --> 43:24.760
 Yeah.

43:24.760 --> 43:26.360
 As long as they don't violently do it.

43:26.360 --> 43:27.360
 Yeah.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.360
 I mean, does that make any sense?

43:28.360 --> 43:32.640
 Like, I mean, as long as they're not going to go hurt innocent people, what are you going

43:32.640 --> 43:33.640
 to do?

43:33.640 --> 43:36.120
 Like there's so many people out there that she's, that's why a lot of these things like,

43:36.120 --> 43:39.960
 you know, 4chan, these sites, a lot of people going on there, they just want to say the

43:39.960 --> 43:45.400
 most fucked up shit because they, it's the thing that gives them, they can laugh or they

43:45.400 --> 43:46.400
 can release steam.

43:46.400 --> 43:49.080
 And it's, it is immature, it is stupid.

43:49.080 --> 43:50.240
 It's not productive.

43:50.240 --> 43:55.360
 It's not, you know, but at the end of the day, if you're not going to give people health

43:55.360 --> 43:58.040
 insurance, you got to give them something.

43:58.040 --> 44:02.240
 It's like when someone in this country dies that everyone disagrees with, right?

44:02.240 --> 44:06.360
 Political figure, media figure, a lot of people dance on their grave online and then

44:06.360 --> 44:10.640
 everyone, people goes, and the other side will always do it, like if a conservative

44:10.640 --> 44:15.640
 dies and everyone goes, great, conservatives goes, and this is grotesque that you, and

44:15.640 --> 44:20.800
 then when RBG dies, they all have parties and the conservatives go, great.

44:20.800 --> 44:25.480
 You have to let people in this country enjoy the deaths of their enemies.

44:25.480 --> 44:26.480
 Yeah.

44:26.480 --> 44:29.120
 You do it because they don't have much else.

44:29.120 --> 44:34.920
 Again, if you gave them other things, you might say, guy, you can go get any operation.

44:34.920 --> 44:37.120
 Why don't you stop?

44:37.120 --> 44:44.680
 But if they're working for shit wages and you haven't figured out a way to treat them,

44:44.680 --> 44:52.200
 treat their cancer diagnosis, and they don't like, I mean, life, you know, you got to derive

44:52.200 --> 44:54.360
 pleasure from something, right?

44:54.360 --> 45:02.040
 It's an interesting point that anger is a good valve, like to, if your life is suffering,

45:02.040 --> 45:07.160
 that there's something very powerful about anger, but I still have hope that it doesn't

45:07.160 --> 45:08.160
 have to be.

45:08.160 --> 45:14.200
 I mean, that kind of channeling into anger that then becomes hate led us into a lot of

45:14.200 --> 45:20.720
 troubles in human history, so you have to be careful in powering people too much in

45:20.720 --> 45:28.320
 that anger, especially, I think, Mike, I think I understand why people are nervous about

45:28.320 --> 45:36.120
 Parler, about Twitter and so on, because all that shit talking about violence was now paired

45:36.120 --> 45:40.080
 with let's get together at this location.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.160
 This was a new thing.

45:42.160 --> 45:48.240
 It's not just being on whatever platform, talking shit, it's saying, we're going to

45:48.240 --> 45:52.440
 in physical space meet, and then everybody got, all these platforms got nervous.

45:52.440 --> 45:58.120
 Well, what happens when all these shit talkers, all these angry people that are just letting

45:58.120 --> 46:04.600
 off steam meet in the physical space, and there was probably overreach, almost definitely

46:04.600 --> 46:07.200
 overreach, but I can understand why they were nervous.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.200
 I agree.

46:08.200 --> 46:11.480
 There doesn't seem to be, and this is when Trump got elected, and when you have whatever

46:11.480 --> 46:12.480
 you have, right?

46:12.480 --> 46:15.440
 Whether you have riots in Portland and Seattle, where you have the Antifa people doing crazy

46:15.440 --> 46:21.960
 things, you have the people storming the Capitol, there never seems to be a ton of an examination

46:21.960 --> 46:27.240
 of why these ideas are becoming popular, why are people so angry, what is leading people

46:27.240 --> 46:28.240
 to this?

46:28.240 --> 46:29.240
 Yes.

46:29.240 --> 46:30.240
 Why are we here?

46:30.240 --> 46:35.360
 What about their lives is to the point where they need to show up at these places, and

46:35.360 --> 46:38.920
 obviously there's going to be people on the fringe, they'll always be the mentally unwell,

46:38.920 --> 46:43.720
 they'll always be people that want to destroy society, but when you look at how popular,

46:43.720 --> 46:50.480
 large, long discredited things, whether it's fascism, totalitarian communism, all of these

46:50.480 --> 46:53.400
 things are like, why are they back?

46:53.400 --> 46:58.760
 Why are they back in a big way, and why are people so fed up with the status quo that

46:58.760 --> 47:09.000
 they're finding solace in the most extreme discredited theories of how to run and operate

47:09.000 --> 47:11.760
 societies, theories that have led to deaths of a lot of people.

47:11.760 --> 47:20.240
 So to me, I'm like, if those people at the Capitol, yes, if they were going to work,

47:20.240 --> 47:27.940
 if they were able to go out and drink at Chili's, if they were able to get a fucking

47:27.940 --> 47:34.560
 checkup, if their job paid a little bit better, and I'm not saying that this is all the reason.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.960
 I'm sure that there's a lot of people there that are doing quite well, and they're still

47:37.960 --> 47:45.000
 nuts, but the anger and the rage that's boiling to the surface of this society, does it come

47:45.000 --> 47:52.920
 from the fact that across the board, people in very different areas, and with very different

47:52.920 --> 47:57.960
 political beliefs, feel like they are being fucked over, and there's nothing they can

47:57.960 --> 47:59.840
 do about it.

47:59.840 --> 48:05.400
 That's what the baseline to me, they look at the people that run the country and run

48:05.400 --> 48:09.920
 the world, whether they're tech titans, the guys that you talk to, or whether they're

48:09.920 --> 48:16.400
 people that run the government, whether they're people that run large banks, large media companies,

48:16.400 --> 48:21.840
 the people that have created this kind of infrastructure that everyone lives in, these

48:21.840 --> 48:28.520
 people are incredibly powerless, and when you push people to that point, logically, sadly,

48:28.520 --> 48:33.360
 and unfortunately, the next thing does seem to be violence.

48:33.360 --> 48:40.680
 Yet the thing that troubles me a lot is you said nobody's asking why these beliefs are

48:40.680 --> 48:49.960
 out there, but sometimes it's not even acknowledged that people are hurting, people are angry,

48:49.960 --> 48:54.560
 just even acknowledging that all the conspiracy theories that are out there, acknowledging

48:54.560 --> 49:00.000
 that they're out there, and then people are thinking about it and talking about it, just

49:00.000 --> 49:04.640
 because otherwise, so it's not acknowledged in this nuanced way, what happens is you say,

49:04.640 --> 49:12.440
 okay, 70 million people are white supremacists, it's just throwing a kind of blanket statement,

49:12.440 --> 49:20.720
 and of course, that gets them angrier, and more makes them feel more powerless, and that

49:20.720 --> 49:28.240
 ultimately, that's what's been painful for me to see is that there's not an acknowledgement

49:28.240 --> 49:38.080
 that most people are good, and there's circumstances where it's just you're pissed off because you

49:38.080 --> 49:39.080
 were powerless.

49:39.080 --> 49:44.840
 You could fall in with a bad crowd, that's the thing, you can just fall in, and it doesn't

49:44.840 --> 49:52.040
 mean that there's not blame, obviously, you have agency, you're a person, but the idea

49:52.040 --> 49:56.200
 that you could be rehabilitated, you could do something stupid, or you could fall into

49:56.200 --> 50:00.480
 a group of people that are, and then in a few years, you could go, what the fuck was

50:00.480 --> 50:01.480
 I doing?

50:01.480 --> 50:05.760
 I'm an ex drug addict, I know what it's like to go from being one thing to being another

50:05.760 --> 50:06.760
 thing, right?

50:06.760 --> 50:10.160
 I'm still a drug addict, if I were to use drugs right now or drink, I would still be

50:10.160 --> 50:11.160
 addicted to them, right?

50:11.160 --> 50:14.640
 I mean, it's not something that I can ever change about myself, but I know what it's

50:14.640 --> 50:19.480
 like to go from one thing to another thing, so when you look at racism, or whatever is

50:19.480 --> 50:24.840
 them, homophobia, misogyny, whatever you're looking at, antisemitism, and you go, that's

50:24.840 --> 50:29.200
 a fixed condition where nobody's ever going to be able to change, nobody's ever going

50:29.200 --> 50:34.640
 to be able to be rehabilitated, nobody's ever going to be able to reimagine themselves

50:34.640 --> 50:39.400
 in a different way, to me, you're just, you're throwing away someone and you're making them

50:39.400 --> 50:44.360
 feel helpless and worthless, and that's going to lead to antisocial behavior that spills

50:44.360 --> 50:46.000
 out into the violence.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
 We don't have a very redemptive society, right?

50:49.000 --> 50:52.800
 That's a huge factor, we don't have a redemptive society.

50:52.800 --> 50:58.960
 That's why I like O.J. Simpson, because O.J. Simpson, yes, he did a bad thing supposedly,

50:58.960 --> 51:04.040
 but he's very kind now on Twitter and he makes very nice points about how we all have to

51:04.040 --> 51:07.520
 get involved in the political process and he's on golf courses and I like watching people

51:07.520 --> 51:12.120
 golf, I don't do it, but I like watching them do it, and he's like an elder statesman because

51:12.120 --> 51:19.440
 I remember him from the naked gun, and I choose to forgive him for whatever happened there,

51:19.440 --> 51:25.400
 which I don't know, but I choose to forgive him really for, I mean, obviously, what they

51:25.400 --> 51:31.720
 say is he cut his wife's head off, but I can look past that and redeem him because he's

51:31.720 --> 51:37.680
 very stable on Twitter and he's a good, I see all these people going crazy on Twitter,

51:37.680 --> 51:43.160
 and I'm like, maybe, O.J. has lived a full life, and I think there's a benefit to that.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.360
 There's a benefit to kind of living a full life.

51:45.360 --> 51:48.920
 Yeah, how many of us have not at least tried to murder somebody?

51:48.920 --> 51:57.120
 100% listen, O.J.'s had the highs and the lows, but he did it on his terms, and there's

51:57.120 --> 51:58.120
 a real...

51:58.120 --> 51:59.520
 It's like a Frank Sinatra song.

51:59.520 --> 52:00.520
 Yeah, he did it my way.

52:00.520 --> 52:04.320
 I mean, there's a benefit to that, and he seems like a very well adjusted person now,

52:04.320 --> 52:09.480
 so I mean, I don't know, how is that a fact, but it is a fact, and that's an uncomfortable

52:09.480 --> 52:10.480
 fact.

52:10.480 --> 52:16.360
 Well, that's a strong case of forgiveness in one of the more extreme cases, I suppose,

52:16.360 --> 52:18.920
 but yeah, there's not a process of forgiveness.

52:18.920 --> 52:23.160
 It seems that people just take a single event from your, sometimes a single statement from

52:23.160 --> 52:31.240
 your past and use that as a categorical like capture of the essence of this particular

52:31.240 --> 52:32.240
 human being.

52:32.240 --> 52:38.360
 So, murder might be a thing that you should get a time out for a little while.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.360
 Murder is bad.

52:39.360 --> 52:43.000
 Murder, and let's just say that.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
 Murder is not good.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.600
 I'm glad you make this definitive statement.

52:46.600 --> 52:53.480
 OJ is an interesting cat because you're like, he's very stable on Twitter.

52:53.480 --> 52:56.040
 He's very like, he's like, let's take a look at it, guys.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.520
 Like we need more of his energy.

52:57.520 --> 52:58.520
 That's what I'm trying to say.

52:58.520 --> 52:59.520
 Yeah.

52:59.520 --> 53:00.600
 I know like, yes, it was bad.

53:00.600 --> 53:03.280
 He killed the woman in the waiter.

53:03.280 --> 53:04.280
 Was not for that.

53:04.280 --> 53:05.280
 Yeah.

53:05.280 --> 53:09.640
 I wish he didn't do that, but the OJ Sims trial was such a fun thing.

53:09.640 --> 53:10.640
 Yeah.

53:10.640 --> 53:12.080
 And like you said, we need more fun people in society.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.080
 Well, you might.

53:13.080 --> 53:17.640
 You know, fun people, you've, your politics have been all over the place.

53:17.640 --> 53:18.800
 I hope so.

53:18.800 --> 53:19.800
 I hope so.

53:19.800 --> 53:24.080
 I mean, imagine not, imagine someone whose politics weren't all over the place.

53:24.080 --> 53:25.080
 It would seem odd.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.080
 Right.

53:26.080 --> 53:30.440
 Like in the 10 years that I've been politically conscious, just because I'm 35 and 21, no,

53:30.440 --> 53:34.480
 I've probably been conscious for over two decades, but like Democrats have become Republicans

53:34.480 --> 53:36.440
 or Republicans become Democrats.

53:36.440 --> 53:40.120
 I remember when Ann Coulter said, we need to defend the George W. Bush when he said,

53:40.120 --> 53:44.280
 we need to go out and Christianize or, you know, modernize the Arab world and we need

53:44.280 --> 53:45.840
 to democratize the Arab world.

53:45.840 --> 53:50.840
 And then Ann Coulter backed Donald Trump and all the right wing in America believed in

53:50.840 --> 53:52.000
 nation building.

53:52.000 --> 53:58.680
 They believed in going out and democratizing areas that might breed radical terrorists,

53:58.680 --> 54:04.680
 whether it was Iraq or wherever you were going, toppling regimes and instituting new democratic

54:04.680 --> 54:05.800
 norms in those countries.

54:05.800 --> 54:08.160
 That was a right wing point of view when I grew up.

54:08.160 --> 54:13.760
 When the right wing switched to, we are going to be isolationists, we're going to take care

54:13.760 --> 54:18.360
 of America first and foremost, we're not going to go into other countries.

54:18.360 --> 54:22.960
 And then the Democrats, who when I grew up were doves and the right wing people were

54:22.960 --> 54:27.760
 more hawkish and the Democrats were like, the military solutions aren't the way.

54:27.760 --> 54:32.400
 We need to have multilateral diplomatic coalitions to solve all the problems.

54:32.400 --> 54:37.400
 Now, you know, Rachel Maddow is like, let's nuke Russia every night on MSNBC.

54:37.400 --> 54:42.080
 The Democrats are like, we need, we need strong presence in Syria.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.440
 We need a strong presence.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.720
 We need to counter Putin all over the globe.

54:45.720 --> 54:48.200
 We need to get, so they are more hawkish on things.

54:48.200 --> 54:55.120
 So literally I have watched two political parties literally flip and it's crazy to watch.

54:55.120 --> 55:01.040
 And in some sense, I've watched that as well because I, when I first saw Barack Obama,

55:01.040 --> 55:03.480
 I admired that he was against the war.

55:03.480 --> 55:11.360
 This is whatever, maybe before he was a senator, he spoke out against the Iraq war.

55:11.360 --> 55:19.360
 And then he, you know, it doesn't feel like, it feels like his administration was more

55:19.360 --> 55:27.320
 hawkish than dovish in a sense with all the drone attacks, with the sort of inability

55:27.320 --> 55:33.440
 to pull back, or at least en masse, efficiently pull back from all the military involvement

55:33.440 --> 55:35.320
 they'll have all over the world.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.320
 And just the language.

55:36.320 --> 55:39.160
 What I think is interesting about that, what's interesting about Obama, because it's a very

55:39.160 --> 55:44.440
 interesting study, is that presidents are controlled in very different ways, right?

55:44.440 --> 55:50.080
 You know, presidents can be controlled by different factors, power factions within Washington.

55:50.080 --> 55:54.840
 And, you know, I think one of the reasons that Obama was maybe, you know, in a very

55:54.840 --> 55:59.800
 close relationship with John Brennan, he was a CIA director, and Obama was very close with

55:59.800 --> 56:06.960
 John Brennan, and Obama was very, you know, you know, I think malleable to the extent

56:06.960 --> 56:10.960
 that, you know, the CIA, and I've had CIA agents on my show, John Kiriakou, a guy who

56:10.960 --> 56:15.720
 went to jail for exposing torture, was saying that, like, you know, you get into the Oval

56:15.720 --> 56:18.920
 Office, all of a sudden you're having that presidential daily briefing every day, and

56:18.920 --> 56:22.920
 the intelligence people come in and they go, listen, man, I mean, there's going to be a

56:22.920 --> 56:27.360
 terrorist attack on your watch if you don't do X, Y, and Z. They go, we have, you know,

56:27.360 --> 56:30.760
 they call it, like, blue book information, which is five levels above top secret, and

56:30.760 --> 56:36.680
 they go, like, hey, man, a guy in Iran at a cafe said he's blowing everything up next

56:36.680 --> 56:39.000
 week, and you know, I mean, it's the same thing as parlor, you don't know if it's true

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
 or not.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.800
 But now the president's making a decision on usually a lot of uncorroborated intelligence

56:44.800 --> 56:49.520
 that goes into a presentation for the president, where you're just terrified every day and

56:49.520 --> 56:51.640
 you don't want a terrorist attack on your watch.

56:51.640 --> 56:54.120
 Now, so why are they getting all this information?

56:54.120 --> 56:58.960
 Because a lot of the people in Washington have an interest in perpetual constant ongoing

56:58.960 --> 57:02.800
 warfare, and there's a lot of financial gain to be had from that.

57:02.800 --> 57:07.360
 So they're sneaking their information into the presentations that are going to the president,

57:07.360 --> 57:11.800
 and then the president is now behaving and going, fuck, I don't want a bomb going off.

57:11.800 --> 57:13.720
 We got to do what we got to do.

57:13.720 --> 57:19.440
 And whatever version of that happens, that is really kind of what is happening, whereas

57:19.440 --> 57:25.680
 the presidents are being controlled by forces that are outside of the political sphere,

57:25.680 --> 57:27.360
 but very much still in it.

57:27.360 --> 57:28.360
 And they have a lot of power.

57:28.360 --> 57:29.360
 That's where the deep state is.

57:29.360 --> 57:33.560
 You know, Trump, there's a lot of ridiculing Trump of the deep state doesn't exist, but

57:33.560 --> 57:34.560
 absolutely exists.

57:34.560 --> 57:36.840
 There's been books about it written by liberal journalists.

57:36.840 --> 57:45.160
 The deep state is only a term for unelected largely power factions in Washington DC that

57:45.160 --> 57:47.960
 outlive any presidential administration.

57:47.960 --> 57:50.320
 These are people that might work at the State Department.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.800
 They might work at the Defense Department.

57:52.800 --> 57:57.960
 These are people that are not always working officially in any government capacity.

57:57.960 --> 58:00.000
 They might be private companies.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.840
 They might be military contractors.

58:02.840 --> 58:06.440
 They might be people of Boeing or Raytheon or General Dynamics.

58:06.440 --> 58:11.960
 And they constitute a group of people that Trump kind of called the swamp.

58:11.960 --> 58:17.720
 But Trump had really no interest in draining the swamp, but he articulated these things.

58:17.720 --> 58:18.720
 And this is what it is.

58:18.720 --> 58:24.920
 You have a lot of interested parties that have budgets that they want, big budgets.

58:24.920 --> 58:29.440
 Everybody wants a budget in Washington, whether you know what it is, they want money.

58:29.440 --> 58:31.720
 And these are the people who really control.

58:31.720 --> 58:36.400
 So this idea that the president is the BLM doll has got to be smashed, which is why the

58:36.400 --> 58:39.400
 horse race model of politics and being like, is it right wing?

58:39.400 --> 58:40.400
 Is it left wing?

58:40.400 --> 58:43.680
 Is it what team am I on and what color am I wearing?

58:43.680 --> 58:44.840
 It's very simplistic.

58:44.840 --> 58:47.320
 But the reality is this is an empire.

58:47.320 --> 58:49.240
 It's past its peak.

58:49.240 --> 58:50.240
 We're in trouble.

58:50.240 --> 58:51.240
 The United States is an empire.

58:51.240 --> 58:52.240
 It's past its peak.

58:52.240 --> 58:53.240
 Yeah.

58:53.240 --> 58:55.320
 I mean, that's just, you could prove that case in court.

58:55.320 --> 59:01.680
 Well, let's go to court right now, but I do love the more complex idea that there's

59:01.680 --> 59:07.280
 just human beings who crave power and seek ways to attain that power through different

59:07.280 --> 59:08.280
 ways.

59:08.280 --> 59:16.040
 If you have Barack Obama or George Bush or Donald Trump, there's different attack vectors.

59:16.040 --> 59:20.320
 Different ways to attain that power, and then you can use that to leverage and it probably

59:20.320 --> 59:25.920
 doesn't have to be just in Washington, D.C. There's people who crave power for all over

59:25.920 --> 59:26.920
 the world.

59:26.920 --> 59:27.920
 Of course.

59:27.920 --> 59:30.920
 Not in, but where we are now in Los Angeles, these people are all good.

59:30.920 --> 59:31.920
 LA.

59:31.920 --> 59:32.920
 The studio, exactly.

59:32.920 --> 59:38.760
 The people that I, from what I understand, they treat everyone fairly and they're nice.

59:38.760 --> 59:43.720
 But I think he sees the bad guys, but out here in LA, everyone's lovely.

59:43.720 --> 59:50.280
 So amidst this fun exploration in your mind through the political landscape that you've

59:50.280 --> 59:57.240
 done over the past couple of decades that you've been conscious politically, where does Donald

59:57.240 --> 59:59.880
 Trump fit into this picture for you?

59:59.880 --> 1:00:01.720
 Great question.

1:00:01.720 --> 1:00:04.120
 Well, he didn't, right?

1:00:04.120 --> 1:00:08.040
 Because we didn't, he wasn't political until four years ago.

1:00:08.040 --> 1:00:12.280
 He got political very quickly before, I mean, he was firing off crazy tweets about where

1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:18.120
 Obama was born or whatever, but he was, he got into politics very quickly and then he

1:00:18.120 --> 1:00:19.120
 became the president.

1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:24.240
 So it was like, I knew him as Donald Trump, this crazy New York City character, the host

1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:25.240
 of The Apprentice.

1:00:25.240 --> 1:00:27.480
 I didn't think much about him.

1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:31.600
 He was just constant, just as constant figures.

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:33.040
 I don't think much about Warren Buffet.

1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:38.360
 I know Trump's like, he's married to a new showgirl all the time and he's always opening

1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:40.920
 another casino and he's on TV.

1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:41.920
 Wait, Warren Buffet, really?

1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:42.920
 No, Trump.

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:43.920
 Oh, Trump.

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:44.920
 Warren Buffet is the opposite, right?

1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:48.760
 Warren Buffet has been married for a million years, lives in a little house in Omaha.

1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:52.040
 But these are the, that's what I associate Trump, like I don't think about Warren Buffet.

1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:53.560
 I don't think about these people.

1:00:53.560 --> 1:01:01.480
 They're just guys that I've known forever that have like a, you associate certain things

1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:02.480
 with them, right?

1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:07.440
 And Trump, we always associate with kind of Folger, Garrish, New Money, Billionaire,

1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:12.840
 married a lot, you know, casinos, Miss Universe pageants, but again, you know, but it makes

1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:20.200
 perfect sense that he really was able to become president at the moment where we were about

1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:22.800
 to have Hillary Clinton versus Jeb Bush.

1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:27.600
 And I think Americans felt like this is now the oligarchy is spinning right in our face.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:32.520
 You're not even making it feel like there's an appearance of democracy.

1:01:32.520 --> 1:01:37.280
 We have two crime families vowing for control of the country every four years.

1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:42.800
 And then there was this rogue kind of upstart guy that was really about himself, you know,

1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:46.000
 Trump doesn't really care that much about the, I mean, really was summarized perfectly

1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.760
 when he left and he just said, Hey, have a good life.

1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:50.800
 That's what he said before he got on Andrews Air Force Base.

1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:51.800
 Have a good life.

1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:54.000
 If you watch this speech, he goes, Hey, have a good life.

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:58.240
 That's what he really feel like, Hey, have a good life.

1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:04.360
 I'm, I'm going to get on a plane right now and fly to a castle I own in, uh, Marlago

1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:10.320
 in Florida and really, I'm not going to think too much about you people outside of how I

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:12.360
 can get more attention in the future.

1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:15.020
 Can I ask you like a therapy questions?

1:02:15.020 --> 1:02:21.680
 What is your favorite and least favorite quality of Donald Trump?

1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:28.840
 So my least favorite quality of Donald Trump, I think, because there's, there's a few of

1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:35.120
 them, uh, his lack of empathy, complete and total lack of empathy.

1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:39.240
 I don't feel that he cares about human beings on any level.

1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:43.000
 And I feel like that's maybe it should be a requirement, right?

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.080
 I mean, I don't think he cares.

1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:46.400
 I think it's obvious that he doesn't care.

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:50.680
 I mean, he sent, you know, basically saying like they're in there, Mike Pence is in there.

1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:54.520
 He knows that his people are going to get, try to get into a Capitol.

1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:56.840
 I mean, those motherfuckers are not going to have jobs.

1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:00.000
 They're going to go to federal prison and he doesn't care.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:01.000
 He doesn't care.

1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.760
 As long as they're storming the Capitol to prove the point that he thinks he won the

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:08.200
 election, he has no concern for these people.

1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:11.320
 His followers, he leads them lamps to the slaughter, right?

1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:13.680
 So that, that's, that's not a respectable call.

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:18.680
 My favorite quality of Donald Trump is his willingness to call bullshit.

1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:20.240
 So his willingness to call bullshit out.

1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:22.440
 He doesn't play the game.

1:03:22.440 --> 1:03:25.960
 He will, you know, when people say about Putin, Putin kills people, he goes, we kill a lot

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:26.960
 of people here too.

1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:32.720
 Like he's, he's willing and able to break the fourth wall and say things that no politician

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:33.720
 has ever said.

1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:40.160
 He's willing to call out hypocrisy, you know, of course not his own, but the media, the

1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:43.280
 members of the political establishment, that's a laudable quality.

1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:45.440
 It's an entertaining quality, right?

1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:46.440
 We all like it.

1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:49.760
 I love to, I'm like, this guy's saying something that a lot of people want said.

1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:50.760
 Yeah.

1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:53.560
 That being said, it's coupled with no real work or action.

1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:54.560
 Right.

1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:59.040
 So it's not coupled with anything behind it that he just wants to, when we did an episode

1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:01.600
 of my podcast once where it's like, essentially he's like criticizing the deep state.

1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:02.920
 He wants a deeper state.

1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:03.920
 Yeah.

1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:04.920
 He wants a deeper state.

1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:07.760
 Like he hired his daughter and her husband.

1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:11.600
 I mean, this is not a guy that's interested in transparency and openness.

1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:17.040
 He's a guy that would just prefer, he wants to run the mafia state.

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:22.800
 But he shakes up the norms of social discourse, political discourse, and that people are just

1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:23.800
 hungry for that.

1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:24.800
 Yes.

1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:29.160
 But he got banned from Twitter, from all the different platforms.

1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:33.320
 Do you think, is there an argument to be made for and against banning?

1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:35.680
 There's always arguments to be made for everything.

1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:38.280
 A permanent ban seems to be an overreaction to me.

1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:39.760
 He's the president of the United States.

1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:43.000
 It also rearranges the power, like whether you like him or hate him, love him or hate

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.920
 him, he was the president.

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:48.880
 We've elevated Twitter is now more powerful than the president.

1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:52.880
 It's like, do you want that to be longterm the salute that the reality, like now Jack

1:04:52.880 --> 1:04:56.680
 at Twitter is more powerful than the president of the United States?

1:04:56.680 --> 1:05:00.040
 Is that a good paradigm going forward?

1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:01.040
 I don't know.

1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:05.000
 I'm not, listen, maybe give him a little time out for a few days.

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:10.320
 I think a time out, a little spanking, certainly, but I don't know if a permanent ban across

1:05:10.320 --> 1:05:13.040
 the board on every social media, I mean, they banned them on Grindr.

1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:15.040
 I mean, this is how hilarious it is.

1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:17.560
 I mean, they banned them across the board on everything.

1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:21.560
 I don't think he could get an Airbnb net, neither can I, but like, I don't think he

1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:22.560
 can do anything.

1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:26.280
 Again, I just, I look back and there's so many people, I have very smart, intelligent

1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:27.760
 friends that go, yeah, but who cares?

1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:28.760
 Yeah, but he's bad.

1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:29.760
 Yeah, but blah, blah, blah, blah.

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.320
 Yeah, but I don't like Milo Yiannopoulos.

1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:32.840
 Yeah, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:35.360
 And I'm like, you have such faith.

1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:40.640
 You have such faith that it's always going to be the people you disliked that are banned.

1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:43.640
 It's always going to be the, it's never going to be you, man.

1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:45.320
 You have so much faith in the government.

1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:48.200
 You have so much faith in tech oligarchs you've never met.

1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:52.480
 You have so much faith in the security state that they're going to always make the right

1:05:52.480 --> 1:05:56.920
 decisions and they're not going to penalize people that shouldn't be penalized.

1:05:56.920 --> 1:06:01.640
 To me, I'm like, wow, I've never had that much faith in any human being ever, including

1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:02.640
 myself.

1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:03.640
 I wouldn't want that power.

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:05.760
 I would start deplatforming people that I hate.

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:08.320
 I would deplatform my aunt, you know what I mean?

1:06:08.320 --> 1:06:10.480
 I would deplatform everyone I know.

1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:15.960
 I mean, so that it's such an insane power to give somebody who gets heard, who gets

1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:16.960
 to speak.

1:06:16.960 --> 1:06:20.000
 Yeah, I'm worried about the effect it has on people like you actually.

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.000
 I agree.

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:27.360
 Of being like, everybody's a little more nervous in what they say.

1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:28.360
 Correct.

1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:29.360
 And that has a big problem.

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:30.360
 Yes.

1:06:30.360 --> 1:06:33.720
 Because then you're just like long term, unmasked like we're talking about.

1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:37.160
 It has an effect where people just become more bland.

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:38.160
 Yeah.

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:43.320
 Self censorship, anxiety, all of these things go into it.

1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:44.320
 We try to fight it.

1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:45.320
 I try to fight it.

1:06:45.320 --> 1:06:49.640
 I think I got to still do what makes me laugh and what makes me laugh is often fucked up.

1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:53.240
 And it's often, you know, it's not always fucked up in a way that, you know, it's going

1:06:53.240 --> 1:06:54.240
 to get me thrown off something.

1:06:54.240 --> 1:07:00.480
 But like, I think pushing certain buttons is funny to me, so I got to keep doing that.

1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:03.160
 Part of the problem is that so many of the lines are blurred, right?

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:08.000
 So you have comedians that are commentators and commentators that are comedians and politicians

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.880
 that feel, so it's like, it's harder to the defense of like, hey, I'm a comedian, leave

1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:11.880
 me alone.

1:07:11.880 --> 1:07:12.880
 Right.

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:16.640
 That defense becomes harder when like, all of these lines are blurring, everybody's kind

1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:18.320
 of everything now.

1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:22.200
 So like, people say to me, you should run for office and they're serious and I'm like,

1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:23.200
 you're crazy.

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:24.200
 But they're serious.

1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:29.400
 Like, so the blurring of everything means that people aren't in their lanes as much.

1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:35.080
 And that you go, well, this guy is dangerous because he's not just making a joke.

1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:38.920
 He's doing something else and he's using humor and I'm like, I'm really not.

1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:40.440
 I'm really just trying to make a joke.

1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:41.440
 That's all.

1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:42.440
 That's really what I'm trying to do.

1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:48.160
 But I do think that because of the flattening, there's a lot of people out there that go,

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:52.800
 they take aim at humor because they go, humor is where bad ideas can kind of, you know,

1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:54.800
 start and flourish.

1:07:54.800 --> 1:08:02.040
 To put some responsibility on you, don't you think humor is a way to, that you are the

1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:05.920
 modern like Jordan Peterson style intellectual.

1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:11.840
 The humor is actually a tool of changing the zeitgeist, changing the social norms.

1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:12.840
 But it also cannot be.

1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:14.440
 I don't think it's any one thing.

1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:17.600
 And I think there's a lot of pressure for a comedian.

1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:18.960
 You can be funny and right.

1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:21.120
 You can be funny and wrong.

1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:25.680
 If your goal is to be right, you might end up being right and not funny.

1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:27.880
 So the reality is funny has to come first.

1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:33.440
 There are brilliant people that have been funny and correct according to people, right?

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:38.680
 But at the end of the day, people that put way too much faith in what comedy is, most

1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:43.680
 of what comedy is, is people showing up to strip malls and telling jokes for an hour

1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:46.920
 while people eat chicken fingers and they all get drunk and they laugh and they feel

1:08:46.920 --> 1:08:48.960
 a little bit better about their lives.

1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:50.640
 That's really the majority of comedy.

1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:54.760
 Then there's like 10 famous people that are really famous that do a version of that in

1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:55.920
 an arena.

1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:59.720
 But the amount of cultural power they have has always been greatly exaggerated.

1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:04.440
 My uncles loved George Carlin, who was anti military industrial complex, anti this, anti

1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:05.440
 that.

1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:07.080
 And then they would go vote for Ronald Reagan.

1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:08.080
 They didn't care.

1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:12.680
 It doesn't, it doesn't really, it doesn't, it's not as powerful as you think.

1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:14.040
 I wish it was.

1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:15.320
 It feels good.

1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:18.520
 It feels good for me to say, I am the new thing.

1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:19.520
 It really isn't.

1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:20.760
 It truly isn't.

1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:24.600
 No one is, comedians are the people that get on stage and say, we're fucked up.

1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:26.200
 We're, we're, we're drug addicts.

1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:27.200
 We're sex addicts.

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:28.200
 We're fat.

1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:29.200
 We're gross.

1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:30.200
 We can't manage our money.

1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:31.200
 We can't stop eating.

1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:33.160
 We can't stop fucking doing horrible things.

1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:34.160
 We're liars.

1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:35.160
 We're narcissists.

1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:36.160
 We're scumbags.

1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:37.840
 We're the people that get out and say that.

1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:42.400
 Only a psychopath would look at us and go, show me the way.

1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:43.640
 Like it's not.

1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:44.640
 I disagree with you.

1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:46.920
 Well, then I'm, then I'm a psychopath.

1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:51.720
 Well, and that's, that's, I mean, I don't think, I don't think, no pushback here.

1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:59.760
 It's, it's another issue, but one I don't because I mean, I understand you using this

1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:03.120
 as a psychological tool for yourself to give yourself freedom.

1:10:03.120 --> 1:10:04.120
 Yes.

1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:09.200
 But the reality is you are one of the rare comedians like a George Carlin who is besides

1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:10.200
 being funny.

1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:11.200
 Yeah.

1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:14.040
 When I hear things like that, I'm like, okay, you're being very sweet, but like, I agree.

1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:15.040
 I understand what you're saying.

1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:17.000
 I do stuff that makes, hopefully makes you think.

1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000
 Yeah.

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.000
 I hope that's what good comedy is.

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:26.520
 I think I try to do that, but I also would hate to feel shackled to the idea of that.

1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:31.320
 I had to make a point and that point had to be correct.

1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:34.920
 I think the best comedy makes fun of everything, makes fun of both sides.

1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:38.400
 And then there's a deeper truth about human, humanity revealed.

1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:42.240
 But then what happens is people take that deeper truth and go, let's politicize it.

1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:43.240
 But what does he mean?

1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:44.240
 Is it the right or the left?

1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:48.480
 And I'm like, I'm doing something that I think speaks to hopefully people on both sides

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:51.600
 for everybody because I'm making fun of people on the left and the right and in the center

1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:53.560
 and people that don't care and people that do care.

1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:55.640
 And I'm trying to figure out a way to do it.

1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:58.680
 But then immediately, anything of value in this culture right now is like, how do we

1:10:58.680 --> 1:10:59.840
 politicize it?

1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:01.040
 How do we put it in a box?

1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:05.920
 So yes, I think comedy could produce a lot of inherently valuable things, reflective,

1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:07.400
 thoughtful things.

1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:12.040
 But then immediately, can it be put in this box where all of those things can be used

1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:13.040
 politically?

1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:14.040
 No.

1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:17.320
 And like when they say like comedy is a great way to speak truth to power.

1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:23.840
 It is, but I don't know how much it changes things.

1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:28.440
 I don't know how much a joke can dethrone a king.

1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:34.280
 I know the idea is nice, but let's look at the practical applications.

1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:40.800
 I mean, we had brilliant comics, Bill Hicks, George Carlin, Richard Price.

1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:46.080
 We had people talk about so many problems in society, illustrate them, put a spotlight

1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:47.600
 on them.

1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:48.600
 And we still have them.

1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:50.640
 They're worse now than they've ever been.

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:51.640
 That's not true.

1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:53.040
 I think the society is better.

1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:58.840
 So to push back in my perspective, it's very possible that those voices were the exact

1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:06.320
 reason we have the world today, which I do believe is actually, I mean, on the boring

1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:12.240
 old measures of what makes a good world, which is the amount of violence in the world, the

1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:17.000
 amount of opportunity that all those kinds of measures, even happiness, all of those

1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.080
 things measured, things have been improving.

1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:23.960
 Stephen Picker gets a lot of shit for this, but he's really good at articulating how the

1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:26.560
 data says pretty clearly that the world is getting better.

1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:32.360
 And it's arguable that the freedoms we do enjoy currently are thanks to the comedic

1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:34.800
 voices or the people who mock.

1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:39.800
 So to me, it's possible that humor is the very thing that saves the world.

1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:44.120
 humor is the very thing that keeps is the balance of power in the world.

1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:48.000
 But I think a lot of the things that those guys criticized, whether it was militarism

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:53.640
 or the elites, the lying, the corruption, the bribery, that's still going on.

1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:54.840
 And it's always going to go on, right?

1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:56.440
 Because that's the nature of human beings.

1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:00.960
 We call it out, we point it out, but we don't have a plan to change.

1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:03.160
 It's not really our job.

1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:07.960
 And I think that too much now is like, well, comedians should have a, like, I don't tell

1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:09.640
 people who to vote for.

1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:13.160
 But the idea that comedians went and told people who to vote for is like to me is crazy.

1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:18.520
 I understand like people have strong opinions, but like, I believe I have a job and my job

1:13:18.520 --> 1:13:22.360
 is to make you laugh or whatever, maybe make you think, but like, my job is not to tell

1:13:22.360 --> 1:13:23.360
 you to vote for me.

1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:24.360
 It's absurd.

1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:29.760
 But see the thing you do by the comedy, like on your Twitter, that people should definitely

1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:30.760
 follow.

1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:31.760
 Yeah, I believe that.

1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:32.760
 That's Jim J. Dillon.

1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:33.760
 I agree with you.

1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:38.640
 Oh, on the, on this point of, I agree with you that people should follow you.

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:39.640
 Yeah.

1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:46.960
 You, you give me, you give me freedom to think on my own, meaning like you're shaking things

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:51.800
 up to where I'm, I don't feel constrained about what I can think about.

1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:52.960
 And that's awesome.

1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:54.460
 And that, thank you.

1:13:54.460 --> 1:13:56.320
 So you're not telling me what to think.

1:13:56.320 --> 1:13:57.640
 You're giving me the freedom to think.

1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:03.280
 That's what great comedy does is, you know, I don't, I don't often agree with George

1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:09.640
 Carlin, like he can get pretty political sometimes, but, you know, just the ability to do that.

1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:10.640
 So rare.

1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:11.640
 Podcasts do that too.

1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:16.520
 Now, like certain people that can really just challenge you to, even when you disagree

1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:19.520
 with them to sort of be like, Oh, it's okay to think about this kind of stuff.

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:20.520
 Yeah.

1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:21.520
 And I appreciate that because that's awesome.

1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:23.020
 And I mean, that, that's great.

1:14:23.020 --> 1:14:25.280
 And a guy like you who's a brilliant guy, that's great.

1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:30.720
 If I'm giving you the license to think, then man, the world is completely fucked, but

1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:31.720
 I'm happy about that.

1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:32.720
 Yeah.

1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:40.920
 Speaking about the world being completely fucked, Alex Jones turned on QAnon, I know

1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:41.920
 almost nothing.

1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:42.920
 It's a very tough match.

1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:43.920
 They had a rough marriage.

1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:44.920
 They fought it.

1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:46.720
 They fought it out for years.

1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:51.560
 And eventually we just knew someone was going to leave someone who was tried to leave him

1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:52.560
 a few months ago.

1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:53.560
 Oh, so.

1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:54.560
 Yeah.

1:14:54.560 --> 1:14:55.560
 He was staying at someone else's house.

1:14:55.560 --> 1:14:57.400
 The car wasn't in the driveway.

1:14:57.400 --> 1:14:58.400
 Yeah.

1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:02.680
 Well, the thing about QAnon that makes it a lot of fun is it's kind of a making of

1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:04.400
 it up as you go along.

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:06.160
 I'm a drug addict, right?

1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:09.240
 So often my lies aren't planned.

1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:10.240
 They're in the moment.

1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:11.240
 A lot of what I do on the podcast.

1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:12.240
 A lot, you know, it's all in the moment.

1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:14.920
 I have an idea of what I want to talk about and I rant and I go.

1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:19.240
 And I've been like stoned and I show up at home and my parents are like, what's going

1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:20.240
 on?

1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:21.240
 There was $50 on the mantle.

1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:22.240
 Now it's not there.

1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:28.680
 And I'm like, well, and I got to make something up on the spot, right?

1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:31.320
 I've been, you know, are you drinking again?

1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:32.320
 No.

1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:33.520
 I'm not.

1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:35.880
 And then you got to have a, well, you were gone for two days.

1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:36.880
 No one knows where you were.

1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:38.040
 And somebody said, you left your car.

1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:42.560
 Well, I was, well, this is, I was at a sales conference and I left my car.

1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:43.560
 I flew to Phoenix.

1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:45.120
 Like I understand what that is.

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:50.480
 QAnon is an ever evolving conspiracy theory where the events are happening in the past,

1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:51.720
 in the present and in the future.

1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:52.720
 It's kind of hilarious.

1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:56.000
 Every conspiracy theory is like Kennedy, something like that, that there's a lot of truth in

1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:57.520
 that or all truth.

1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:00.960
 But at the end of the day, it's like you're looking back from 30,000 feet analyzing little

1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:02.520
 things that have already happened.

1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:08.600
 QAnon's like, so I think Alex is kind of like a little tired of the constant evolving nature

1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:11.200
 of that conspiracy theory.

1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:14.160
 So he's not a fan of like the jazz that is QAnon.

1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:16.000
 So they're not, because they're improvising constantly.

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:17.000
 They're improvising.

1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:20.560
 Alex is like, Hey man, I was on board a little bit, but at the end of the day, it's getting

1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:23.040
 a little annoying because it can turn on you.

1:16:23.040 --> 1:16:24.440
 Eventually you become part of the conspiracy.

1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:25.440
 Right.

1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:26.680
 Alex is controlled opposition.

1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:28.560
 That's what they'll say.

1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:31.600
 Eventually you, because QAnon just eats things.

1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:33.320
 So it's a conspiracy that just eats things.

1:16:33.320 --> 1:16:37.000
 The minute you start to say, Hey man, maybe that's not, it'll just eats you and go, well,

1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:38.520
 you're in on it.

1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:39.520
 Everyone's in on it.

1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:40.520
 Everyone's a satanic pedophile.

1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:41.520
 Everybody.

1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:43.840
 Everyone that questions it is eating children.

1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:46.920
 And you go, wait a minute, that seems illogical.

1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:48.360
 And but now there's not enough children.

1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:49.360
 Now there's not enough.

1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:55.600
 And I think QAnon's over now, unfortunately, because for these people, but I think fortunately

1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:57.600
 for them, they're going to have to find a new hobby.

1:16:57.600 --> 1:17:01.000
 But I think it's over now because even the best QAnon people now are starting to go,

1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.840
 Hey man, this might not be going down the way we thought.

1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:08.120
 But they've literally gone as far as to say that like Biden and Trump switched faces.

1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:10.640
 Trump's actually still the president except Biden's.

1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:13.880
 You have to be a real moron now.

1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:16.520
 You got to be real stupid now.

1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:17.520
 It's at the end.

1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:21.360
 Like when it was cool, like when the Epstein stuff happened, QAnon was like, it was party

1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:23.040
 at Q.

1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:27.200
 And then when the Hunter Biden laptop stuff started to happen, they were like, dancing.

1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:28.720
 It's time.

1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:32.240
 And then Biden wins.

1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:34.800
 And they're like, wait, whoa.

1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:36.480
 And it's just like, it's the day after the party.

1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:40.080
 QAnon, if you ever went to a party in high school or college, QAnon right now is the

1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:41.080
 day after the party.

1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:45.320
 You wake up, it's 12 noon, the sun is hitting you in the face, you're hungover, there's

1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:48.480
 a stench of disgusting beer and cigarettes all over the house.

1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:50.800
 You're like, what the fuck happened here?

1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:53.960
 I got to get out of here and get a bacon egg and cheese.

1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:55.120
 That's what QAnon is.

1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:58.760
 They got to sober up, get out of that house, get a bacon egg and cheese and go, man, we

1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:00.880
 were fucking whacked.

1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:02.040
 We were high, dude.

1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:06.560
 I thought Nancy Pelosi was eating children for four years and that Donald Trump was going

1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:08.400
 to put her in Guantanamo Bay.

1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:09.400
 Wow.

1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:13.560
 That was, because I mean, it's interesting that people had to do that after the 60s.

1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:17.400
 They were like, yeah, I just did a bunch of ass and I lived in a ranch in Malibu and

1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:20.080
 fucked everyone I ever saw.

1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:22.440
 And they're like, I thought that was the way the world was going to go.

1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:27.680
 And I followed some shaman guy, some guru who just wanted to fuck me and 10 other people

1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:29.040
 that were living there.

1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:30.560
 And we did that for three years.

1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:33.760
 Apparently, we never created the utopia we thought we were going to have.

1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:37.360
 And now I'm back working here at all state insurance.

1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:39.160
 And we have great policies.

1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:42.160
 And we'd love you to come in the office so we can break them down for you.

1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:43.640
 It all ends, folks.

1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:45.880
 All the love, all the bullshit ends.

1:18:45.880 --> 1:18:46.880
 But it's fun.

1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:47.880
 They had so much fun.

1:18:47.880 --> 1:18:53.360
 QAnon was hard to get mad at because they were, this was all they had.

1:18:53.360 --> 1:18:54.360
 Yeah.

1:18:54.360 --> 1:18:56.880
 And they were, they were quite good at it.

1:18:56.880 --> 1:18:57.880
 And they were good at it.

1:18:57.880 --> 1:19:01.520
 And they, and, and, and, and it was a lot of desperate people, but they were also rich

1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:02.520
 idiots.

1:19:02.520 --> 1:19:04.680
 There's also like dumb rich people.

1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:09.400
 And you, those are like the saddest people in Q because it's like they should, they

1:19:09.400 --> 1:19:11.520
 have the resources to do other things.

1:19:11.520 --> 1:19:14.520
 But they just love Q. They're like, I'm just into this.

1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:17.960
 And I'm like, you're rich.

1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:18.960
 Go do something.

1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:19.960
 How curious are you?

1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:20.960
 Go to the Amazon.

1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:21.960
 Go bird.

1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:22.960
 Why?

1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:23.960
 I don't know.

1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:26.960
 But they're, you know, so it's sad, but they're like done now.

1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:28.760
 I mean, they're, they're, oh, it's over.

1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:32.120
 Oh, so you think this is the, I think everything's ending.

1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:36.200
 My whole thing is that Trump's out, QAnon's over, the quarantine is going to end.

1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:40.360
 Everything's going to go back to something that's more recognizable.

1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:42.240
 I think that.

1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:44.800
 Are you optimistic about the 2021 and what?

1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:50.840
 Two degree, in certain aspects, I have optimism and then I have, I have short term optimism

1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:55.160
 and long term pessimism, meaning that I think in the short term, things can get better.

1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:58.800
 I think long term, because there's so many forces that are out of our control that are

1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:03.520
 revolving in ways I barely understand that are carving up society, it's going to be very

1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:08.160
 tough long term to be completely optimistic, like, Hey, it's going to be great.

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:09.560
 It's going to be good forever.

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:13.200
 But short term, I think, yeah, this quarantine will end, things will get better, the economy

1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:18.840
 will get a little better, the constant Trump craziness will die down a little bit.

1:20:18.840 --> 1:20:19.840
 That's my hope.

1:20:19.840 --> 1:20:24.480
 And people can go back to focusing on things that matter, which is, you know, the things

1:20:24.480 --> 1:20:26.080
 that are near you and close to you.

1:20:26.080 --> 1:20:27.520
 Yeah, the humans around you.

1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:32.360
 Humans around you, not Nancy Pelosi, I have my, I have uncles that talk about Nancy Pelosi.

1:20:32.360 --> 1:20:34.960
 I'm like, you've never met her, you'll never meet her.

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:35.960
 Shut up.

1:20:35.960 --> 1:20:42.880
 And I have a belief that this kind of local love and kindness that you naturally can have

1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:49.280
 for human beings that you actually know, can be expanded at scale through the social networks

1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:54.600
 that we use, that we build, that Twitter is currently failing at that miserably.

1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:55.600
 That would be great.

1:20:55.600 --> 1:21:00.360
 But that's if we were able to increase the love through the social networks, that would

1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:01.360
 be great.

1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:03.520
 It feels very hard to.

1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:05.020
 It's a worthy challenge.

1:21:05.020 --> 1:21:10.480
 You've tweeted, one of the underreported reasons conspiracy theories take hold is because

1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:13.400
 some of them are true.

1:21:13.400 --> 1:21:22.000
 What conspiracy theories do you believe that are sort of important for people to think

1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.880
 about, would you say?

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:30.520
 Kennedy was not killed by a lone gunman with no connections to any other situation, government,

1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:31.520
 you know.

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:39.160
 I believe that JFK was removed from office by a group of people that had very different

1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:40.160
 interests.

1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:42.280
 That's the question of like deep state.

1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:48.560
 So these are powerful people that are able now to dictate through basically the threat

1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:53.560
 of violence, what the presidents, the surface powerful people in our society.

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:54.560
 Yeah.

1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:59.680
 I mean, again, I'm not, I want another investigation into 9 11, not because I think George Bush

1:21:59.680 --> 1:22:03.920
 pressed a button and made 9 11 happened, but because we invaded the country of Iraq.

1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:09.200
 And then we, you know, 15 out of 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.

1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:13.000
 There was tons of stuff in the 9 11 import that didn't make sense to anybody.

1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:16.160
 There's tons of stuff about that day that I feel like we just don't know.

1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:17.160
 Yeah.

1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:18.660
 That's sorry to interrupt.

1:22:18.660 --> 1:22:24.520
 That's when I, my little aunt life touched upon conspiracy theory world and first learned

1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:25.520
 about Alex Jones.

1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:26.520
 Right.

1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:32.960
 When 9 11 happened, it was very frustrating to me how poorly the reporting and the transparency

1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:37.520
 around what exactly happened, who knew what, all that kind of a basic information that

1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:45.160
 you would hope the government would release, reveal and use as like a lesson for how we

1:22:45.160 --> 1:22:46.160
 prevent this.

1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:50.840
 Instead, it felt like a lot of stuff was being hidden in order to manipulate some kind of

1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:52.920
 machine that leads us to war.

1:22:52.920 --> 1:22:53.920
 Yeah.

1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:54.920
 That's fair to say.

1:22:54.920 --> 1:22:55.920
 Yeah.

1:22:55.920 --> 1:22:57.360
 I feel like we've gotten the full story.

1:22:57.360 --> 1:22:58.360
 I don't know what the full story is.

1:22:58.360 --> 1:22:59.360
 I can't.

1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:02.440
 I don't know what it is, but I don't feel like we've gotten the full story.

1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:03.440
 Yeah.

1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:06.520
 There are, there are groups of powerful pedophiles, right?

1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:08.840
 Whether they're in the Catholic church or they're in the government or wherever they

1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:11.280
 are, they are able to cover things up that they do.

1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:15.240
 They're able to silence people that try to out them in terms of like, you know, disrupt

1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:16.240
 their operations.

1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:17.240
 That's true.

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:18.760
 QAnon has nuggets of truth.

1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:20.360
 It just went crazy.

1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:26.040
 Any conspiracy theory that involves the Knights Templar and also Chrissy Teigen is probably

1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:27.040
 wrong.

1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:28.040
 You know?

1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:29.040
 What's the Knights Templar?

1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:33.640
 Well, it's just this group of knights back in the day, you know, it's that, you just

1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:36.880
 suppose these secret meanings and like in every conspiracy, they talk about like, you

1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:41.720
 know, if you go deep enough, it's like the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians, you know,

1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:44.880
 all of these secret groups throughout history, the Illuminati, the…

1:23:44.880 --> 1:23:46.880
 Oh, and there's a thread that connects all of it, some public Chrissy Teigen.

1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:47.880
 Oh, yeah.

1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:48.880
 It connects it all to David Spade.

1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:50.480
 I mean, it's a little much.

1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:53.280
 Well, how do you, if you're David Spade, defend yourself, by the way.

1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:56.720
 You ignore it because it's hilarious and I know David Spade, it's like Hollywood's

1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:57.720
 kind of boring.

1:23:57.720 --> 1:23:58.720
 Yes.

1:23:58.720 --> 1:23:59.720
 There are sex orgies.

1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:00.720
 I'm not invited.

1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:01.720
 I'm sure there's shit going on.

1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:02.720
 Kids do get abused.

1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:03.720
 Women get abused.

1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:04.720
 I'll invite you to one.

1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:05.720
 Please.

1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:06.720
 If you want.

1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:07.720
 We got the $75,000 dog.

1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:08.720
 And then we'll get one.

1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:13.120
 But, you know, I, you know, me and David Spade, we go out to sushi restaurants, like, and

1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:15.680
 you sit there and you listen to people complain.

1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:17.080
 That's what a lot of it is.

1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:22.280
 What a lot of Hollywood is, is deeply sad tragedy that people don't understand that

1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:26.080
 it's some of it is nefarious and dark and there are problems and there are real power

1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:27.080
 brokers here.

1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:29.360
 It's a dark town, 100%.

1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:30.360
 But they did it.

1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:34.840
 Everybody that lives here is in some wide ranging, vast conspiracy, isn't true.

1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:41.640
 It ignores how humdrum, boring, deeply sad most people's lives are in Hollywood and it

1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:44.800
 ignores how sad fame is in general.

1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:46.240
 Fame's a sad thing.

1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:49.440
 Not always, but a lot of times it's a sad thing.

1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:50.440
 It's fleeting.

1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:51.440
 It's ephemeral.

1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:52.520
 It doesn't last.

1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:55.640
 It separates you from other people.

1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:56.640
 It's isolating.

1:24:56.640 --> 1:24:59.760
 It can be traumatic, depending on what's going on.

1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:01.680
 Obviously, it's better than the alternative.

1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:05.240
 If you're trying to be famous, it's better to be famous than not famous, right?

1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:06.760
 I'll say that.

1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:09.320
 But it's a mixed bag to a degree.

1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:11.720
 There are things about it that aren't great.

1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:16.120
 And Hollywood has a deep undercurrent of sadness of people that have not realized their dreams

1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:18.920
 and people that have realized them.

1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:21.280
 Both of those people.

1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:24.800
 The people that win Olympic gold medals can sometimes suffer from depression.

1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:25.800
 Correct.

1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:26.800
 They've lost.

1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:29.000
 Well, somebody said, and I forget who said it, it's a great quote.

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:30.000
 It's not mine.

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000
 I think it's from a book.

1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:32.000
 It might be from a TV show.

1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.800
 Sometimes they quote something and they're like, that's from like, Charlotte's Web.

1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:36.600
 I'm like, oh.

1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:39.240
 The two worst things are, oh, I think it's from the movie Limitless.

1:25:39.240 --> 1:25:40.320
 I'm like an idiot.

1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:42.520
 But anyway, thanks for having me on.

1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:44.520
 Tomorrow, you've done some genius.

1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:46.720
 I wish this.

1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:47.720
 It's from the movie.

1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:51.480
 And I think he says, the worst two worst things in the world are not, oh, you know, it's not

1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:52.480
 from Limitless.

1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:57.960
 I think it's from the movie where Nicholas Cage sold weapons.

1:25:57.960 --> 1:25:59.360
 It was called Lord of War.

1:25:59.360 --> 1:26:00.360
 It's a little better than Limitless.

1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:01.360
 Anyway.

1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:02.360
 That's a good movie.

1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:03.360
 It's a great movie.

1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:05.440
 He said, the two worst things in the world are not getting what you want and getting

1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:06.440
 it.

1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:10.520
 So the undercurrents of sadness that run through Hollywood are there are two rivers that converge

1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:14.600
 and there are people that just never had it and people that have it and go, now what?

1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:15.600
 And so it's a sad place.

1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:16.600
 It's tragic place.

1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:17.600
 And there's a lot of, it's boring.

1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:20.680
 That's what people don't realize is like, it's actually kind of boring.

1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:22.080
 Well, life is kind of boring.

1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:23.080
 Life is kind of boring.

1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:26.560
 But there's also like, you know, so I think QAnon's this way to make a lot of it seem

1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:27.560
 like it's super exciting.

1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:28.560
 It's super exciting.

1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:31.640
 And listen, I don't want to diminish the experiences of people who've been abused because there

1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:33.320
 is a lot of horror here.

1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:37.040
 But the whole QAnon thing was like, everybody in everything is doing.

1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:38.040
 And that's not true.

1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:44.240
 But see the, just to link on that a little bit is Bill Gates, the conspiracy theories

1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:51.960
 around Bill Gates bother me because this is me dumb naive Lex thinks that Bill Gates did

1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:53.440
 a lot of good for this world.

1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:54.440
 Sure.

1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:58.960
 First by creating a company that empowered personal computers.

1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:04.800
 And second by donating a ton of money for like treating malaria in Africa and all those

1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:06.600
 kinds of things.

1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:09.680
 And there's these huge amounts of conspiracies.

1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:15.600
 I think based on like just replies to whenever Bill Gates does anything.

1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:22.280
 Like to me, the top replies should be about how inspiring that guy is to donate so much

1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:23.280
 money.

1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:24.280
 Well, I think, I think that.

1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:25.280
 And so sorry too.

1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:32.120
 And the thing I'm struggling with is if I'm Bill Gates, like, how do you behave differently?

1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:36.520
 How do you show people that you're, if you're not, I don't know, doing creepy stuff

1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:38.040
 that they're saying he's doing.

1:27:38.040 --> 1:27:42.320
 Well, I think part of it is that he's done some really good stuff, right?

1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:43.320
 He's an innovative guy.

1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:47.320
 He's on the vanguard of a lot of things, but he's also the antichrist.

1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:51.480
 And I think that that is, you know, they're not mutually exclusive.

1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:56.040
 He is the prince of darkness as well as some, no, here's my view of Bill Gates.

1:27:56.040 --> 1:27:58.840
 He's a Batman villain billionaire, meaning that he's not a villain, but he's got all

1:27:58.840 --> 1:27:59.840
 this money, right?

1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:00.840
 Here's the thing.

1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:01.840
 And I love mosque and all these guys.

1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:02.840
 I know you love these guys.

1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:05.600
 Listen, when you have the kind of money that these guys have and you have the vision that

1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:08.320
 they have and they want society to look a certain way.

1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:10.440
 And a lot of them are doing great things.

1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:13.120
 People, they need to get better at the pushback.

1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:17.000
 They need to get a little better when somebody says, Hey man, what's going on over there?

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.240
 Bill Gates needs to be a little better at going, here's what?

1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:21.240
 Yeah.

1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:23.720
 Because, you know, Bill Gates has the money.

1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:27.400
 You know, I think he, he wants, he wanted to shoot a missile of dust at the atmosphere

1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:28.760
 to help global warming.

1:28:28.760 --> 1:28:31.320
 And a lot of scientists were like, Hey man, that might not be the way to do it.

1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:34.160
 But no one in history, like so few people in history have had the resources to even

1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:37.680
 have that thought that if you have the resources to have that thought, and you have designs

1:28:37.680 --> 1:28:42.480
 on the way you want society to look, whether it's public health policy, vaccinations, whatever,

1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:46.720
 you have to get a little better at dealing with legitimate critiques.

1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:49.760
 And obviously you're not defending yourself against people that say you're the anti Christ,

1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:51.720
 but like you need to get a little better.

1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:56.760
 And I feel like Bill Gates and some of those people at that level are like, Oh, PR is kind

1:28:56.760 --> 1:28:58.760
 of like, you know, they're terrible at it.

1:28:58.760 --> 1:28:59.760
 They're terrible at it.

1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:00.760
 They're terrible at it.

1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:01.760
 Him and Zuckerberg are really bad at it.

1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:02.760
 Zuckerberg's horrible at it.

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:06.680
 And he seems especially bad at public.

1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:07.680
 Yeah.

1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:14.680
 And it makes me feel so bad because the problem of being a billionaire is you lose touch

1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:15.680
 with reality.

1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:21.320
 If you're not careful, I think Elon is good at at least so far maintaining touch with

1:29:21.320 --> 1:29:22.320
 reality.

1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:27.280
 No, if you look at the name of his child, you can clearly see, Liz, I do like him and

1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:30.560
 I do think what he's done with Tesla, you know, my producer is a Tesla and he never

1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:34.880
 shuts up about it and most people that have Teslas never shut up about them and they thought

1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:37.280
 they think they're part of the development team at SpaceX.

1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:43.080
 And I liked that he's created a world where people can get excited about a $37,000 car

1:29:43.080 --> 1:29:46.600
 and never shut the fuck up about it to the point where I have to threaten people with

1:29:46.600 --> 1:29:50.560
 physical violence to get them to stop telling me about that their car drives itself.

1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:51.560
 Oh, you should get a Tesla.

1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:56.000
 Maybe have a few less drinks and a few fewer Vicodin and you can drive yourself.

1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:57.000
 Have you thought about getting a Tesla?

1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:58.000
 I've never thought about it.

1:29:58.000 --> 1:29:59.000
 I don't like them.

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:00.000
 They're minimalist.

1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:01.000
 I don't like them.

1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:02.000
 I want more.

1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:03.000
 I want more.

1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:04.000
 Get the Cybertruck.

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:05.000
 I want to stay.

1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:06.000
 I'm just being a trolling you.

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:09.000
 My guy, my producer wants a Cybertruck.

1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:14.600
 I want a stagecoach, old school stagecoach, horse thief shit.

1:30:14.600 --> 1:30:16.880
 It's going back to that.

1:30:16.880 --> 1:30:18.280
 I live in an area with a lot of horses.

1:30:18.280 --> 1:30:20.440
 It's going back to like whipping a horse.

1:30:20.440 --> 1:30:25.680
 I want an animal to shriek while I go by.

1:30:25.680 --> 1:30:27.600
 You want more suffering in the world, not less.

1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:28.800
 Oh, I think we need it.

1:30:28.800 --> 1:30:33.720
 OK, but I just don't like that billionaire is a bad word.

1:30:33.720 --> 1:30:34.720
 And it's not.

1:30:34.720 --> 1:30:35.720
 Sure.

1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:36.720
 Not every billionaire is a pedophile.

1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:37.720
 I know.

1:30:37.720 --> 1:30:42.120
 But the problem is a lot of like, it's just, you know, Epstein was very smart at like just

1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:45.160
 getting people at that house and taking photos of them.

1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:47.480
 Nobody knew what they were doing, but it's like it was one of those things where it's

1:30:47.480 --> 1:30:49.360
 like, Epstein was the most social guy ever.

1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:54.840
 Like every photo, he's like, hey, it's like everyone that's ever done anything in the

1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:57.400
 world has been at that fucking island.

1:30:57.400 --> 1:30:59.600
 Every human being is like in a photo.

1:30:59.600 --> 1:31:00.600
 It's just weird.

1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:01.600
 Like I'm in like it's funny.

1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:02.600
 Me and my friends get together.

1:31:02.600 --> 1:31:03.600
 We don't ever take photos, right?

1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:04.600
 Yeah.

1:31:04.600 --> 1:31:09.120
 Like last night, a few people, I was on my birthday yesterday, I'm 17, and my my friends

1:31:09.120 --> 1:31:11.760
 came over and we're just eating dinner, right?

1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:12.760
 And we had a fun night.

1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:14.920
 Just four people that are over, nobody, right?

1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:18.280
 Nobody ever thought like, let's let's, hey, I want to remember it.

1:31:18.280 --> 1:31:19.600
 Let's take photos.

1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:25.800
 I'm 36, but everything Epstein did, there's just photos of everybody.

1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:26.800
 It's interesting.

1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:29.000
 Do you think Jeff Epstein killed himself?

1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:35.400
 No, I think he was killed by that guy that that that that guy that they put in his cell,

1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:38.120
 that lunatic, who was that big muscled guy.

1:31:38.120 --> 1:31:41.600
 I think he was just, he did it for money, kept his mouth shut.

1:31:41.600 --> 1:31:44.160
 Money from whom do you think?

1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:47.280
 Massad, MI6, CIA, all three.

1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:50.200
 So there's a lot of pressure from a lot of different powerful people.

1:31:50.200 --> 1:31:52.200
 Probably Massad, CIA more.

1:31:52.200 --> 1:31:57.960
 I mean, it seems very clear that he was working inside of a honeypot intelligence operation.

1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:01.240
 Just Lane Maxwell's father was an Israeli super spy.

1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:04.720
 Just Lane Maxwell's working for Israeli intelligence, it would be odd to think.

1:32:04.720 --> 1:32:09.080
 And of course, the CIA knows about everything that Israeli intelligence is doing with Americans.

1:32:09.080 --> 1:32:14.080
 So I would think that it's a very cozy relationship with those two intelligence agencies.

1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:17.320
 And I think if you ran it by anyone, I think if you ran it by French intelligence, they'd

1:32:17.320 --> 1:32:19.520
 go, yeah, no, get, get here.

1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:22.840
 I don't think there's any intelligence service in the world whose job is to protect the

1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:27.240
 powerful people that live in their countries that was against him getting whacked.

1:32:27.240 --> 1:32:31.400
 But do you think it's possible that he is just an evil person who is after manipulating

1:32:31.400 --> 1:32:33.440
 people and also was a pedophile?

1:32:33.440 --> 1:32:34.440
 No, no.

1:32:34.440 --> 1:32:35.440
 So there's a bigger thing.

1:32:35.440 --> 1:32:36.440
 Absolutely.

1:32:36.440 --> 1:32:38.080
 No factual that there's a bigger thing.

1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:39.080
 Evil people don't get handed.

1:32:39.080 --> 1:32:40.840
 Those are your facts, Tim Dillon.

1:32:40.840 --> 1:32:42.680
 No, there's the facts of the case.

1:32:42.680 --> 1:32:44.400
 You don't get handed a 65.

1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:49.480
 Show me another evil guy who was handed a $65 million dollar place by Les Maw.

1:32:49.480 --> 1:32:50.640
 That's Wexner.

1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:57.160
 Show me another evil guy that got that type of handshake deal where he was basically let

1:32:57.160 --> 1:33:03.480
 off without anything after a judge had made a very sweetheart deal for him after he was

1:33:03.480 --> 1:33:06.400
 accused of molesting a 14 year old.

1:33:06.400 --> 1:33:11.000
 Show me another evil guy that doesn't have that kind of backing, that has those type

1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:13.840
 of friends, those connections, those type of properties.

1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:17.000
 Show me multiple passports all over the world.

1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:20.520
 You show me a guy without anyone backing him that's doing it.

1:33:20.520 --> 1:33:21.520
 Why did they?

1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:26.120
 So you think he's just an evil guy who is doing this for whom it's his own just chits

1:33:26.120 --> 1:33:27.120
 and giggles.

1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:28.520
 He's just getting off on it.

1:33:28.520 --> 1:33:29.520
 Human nature, yeah.

1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:30.520
 Human nature, huh?

1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:31.520
 It's human nature.

1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:33.520
 $70 million dollar limestone match.

1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:34.520
 I'm visibly mocked.

1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:35.520
 Yeah.

1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:36.520
 Is it human nature?

1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:37.520
 And it's...

1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:38.760
 I don't think it's human nature.

1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:39.760
 I think it's...

1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:43.520
 I think they manipulated human nature, but I think they did it.

1:33:43.520 --> 1:33:44.520
 I think just lame...

1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:48.960
 I think Epstein was really just a functionary and I think just lame was kind of a pimp and

1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:54.400
 Epstein was kind of a guy that made the money okay and hid money and things like that and

1:33:54.400 --> 1:33:56.120
 worked for a lot of powerful people.

1:33:56.120 --> 1:34:00.040
 I don't believe in lone pedophiles anymore.

1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:01.040
 I don't even believe that.

1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:03.960
 If you're a pedophile, you're like in a group.

1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:04.960
 You know what I mean?

1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:05.960
 Whoa.

1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:11.320
 I'm not even going there, but staying on just lame.

1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:13.200
 So you believe there's some power in her.

1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:14.840
 What do you think happens to her?

1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:15.840
 No.

1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:16.840
 What are the differences?

1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:17.840
 Great question.

1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:23.000
 I mean, I don't know what'll happen to her, but I imagine she'll get some type of deal,

1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:27.720
 closed door thing years from now when people don't really care about the case and she'll

1:34:27.720 --> 1:34:31.280
 serve some time in a very lax thing or she'll be killed.

1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:36.160
 I mean, again, it's like if she was doing what she was doing, which is I believe a fact

1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:43.160
 that she was compromising powerful people so that they could be blackmailed by the intelligence

1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:51.400
 services of the US and Israel, probably, I don't see how she wasn't doing that.

1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:52.400
 Someone's black.

1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:55.360
 Someone's using the photos and the tapes, right?

1:34:55.360 --> 1:34:57.880
 Someone's using that against these people.

1:34:57.880 --> 1:34:59.440
 Someone wants to control these people.

1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:01.000
 Well, who and why?

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.000
 That's the real question.

1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:07.840
 And I think the real question is you want to exert control over congressmen and senators

1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:13.200
 and presidents because they have the power to make decisions to affect about the CIA

1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:16.080
 just works for a lot of very wealthy people.

1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:20.960
 That's what the CIA, so how the CIA started, right, was lawyers, bankers, they're protecting

1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:26.280
 financial interests of multinational corporations all over the world, overthrowing democratically

1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:30.160
 elected governments, going in and doing subterfuge campaigns, encouraging terror.

1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:31.840
 They were doing all kinds of crazy stuff.

1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:33.280
 I don't see why that would change.

1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:38.320
 I think that's who they still represent and I think those people want certain policies

1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:42.840
 and certain people pushed forward and I think those people are controlled and I think one

1:35:42.840 --> 1:35:49.440
 of the ways to control people is their sexual problems and that's the way they did it.

1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:54.480
 I wish there was a way to, because everything you just said now is...

1:35:54.480 --> 1:35:57.160
 Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?

1:35:57.160 --> 1:35:59.760
 I'm being indoctrinated on air.

1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:06.800
 You think there's just a fun, random guy who just wanted to make home movies to presidents?

1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:11.800
 Well, you think I'm just some random guy, I'm just trying to sell myself as somebody

1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:14.200
 who is friendly with the American audience.

1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:20.480
 I believe you are backed by people that want people to be more comfortable with robot dogs.

1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:21.480
 I believe that.

1:36:21.480 --> 1:36:23.520
 I believe you're pushed to be the happy face of AI.

1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:26.960
 Which is why I will take the happy face out.

1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:30.760
 No editing, Joe Rogan's rule, no editing.

1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:31.760
 This is live.

1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:35.880
 No, I mean, I wish there was a way for some of the conspiracy theories to prove that that's

1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:37.760
 not the case.

1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:39.800
 The CIA is...

1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:45.880
 There is some possibility in my mind that institutions like the CIA and different kind

1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:54.880
 of organizations are driven less by organized malevolence and more by just incompetence.

1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:56.680
 Just bureaucracy being incompetent.

1:36:56.680 --> 1:37:01.920
 I think that argument gets less and less persuasive when you look at all the things they've been

1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:04.520
 able to do.

1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:09.120
 It's very certain, just like you said, that there's a bunch of them that have done...

1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:14.240
 There's some conspiracy theories that are dramatic and true.

1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:19.320
 The question is, I wish there was a way to prove that some of them are not.

1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:23.360
 It's very difficult because so much is shrouded in mystery.

1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:27.800
 One of the things I'm bothered by is when people accuse other athletes of using steroids,

1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:33.360
 for example, and it's just, yes, a lot of people use steroids, but it sucks that people just

1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:35.600
 don't believe you.

1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:40.480
 There's some incredible athletes that look shredded, that look just incredible performers,

1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:46.280
 and everybody just says that they're on steroids, they're kind of assumed.

1:37:46.280 --> 1:37:50.560
 People accuse me all the time of being on performance enhancing drugs and steroids.

1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:58.960
 It is hard, but what I remind them is it's my appearance as a result of dedication,

1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:02.080
 but it's hard work, diet, exercise, dedication.

1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:03.960
 Are you on keto?

1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:05.320
 I'm on keto.

1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:06.840
 I'm doing a version of keto.

1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:07.840
 You're keto, right?

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:08.840
 Yeah.

1:38:08.840 --> 1:38:12.360
 I'm doing a version of keto right now with bread, and it's...

1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:13.360
 Do you see what I mean?

1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:14.880
 You carb up in order to build.

1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:16.120
 It's keto with sugar.

1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:18.360
 It's called keto plus sugar.

1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:21.120
 It's a good diet for...

1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:25.520
 I grew up in the 90s when nobody ever lost weight, sadly, because every diet was like,

1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:28.280
 you can eat what you want, just be accountable.

1:38:28.280 --> 1:38:30.080
 No one even knew what that meant.

1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:33.600
 So it would be like my mother being like, if you have chocolate chip pancakes, have

1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.800
 a glass of water.

1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:37.920
 Just take a walk around the block.

1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:41.040
 You go to McDonald's three times a day, just walk around the block.

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:44.600
 It's what my parents used to say, my mother would be like, just walk around the block.

1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:45.600
 You're fine.

1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:50.120
 I'm going to have a cigarette, walk 20 steps, walk 20 steps back.

1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:51.520
 It's exercise.

1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:54.440
 So there's too many conspiracies out there.

1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:55.440
 A lot of them aren't true.

1:38:55.440 --> 1:39:00.080
 A lot of them are bitter, angry people trying to justify their own impotence, not being

1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:03.240
 able to do anything in life, and they're like, the people that have done something in life,

1:39:03.240 --> 1:39:04.240
 they're all nefarious.

1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:05.240
 It's all...

1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:06.240
 The cards just act against me.

1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:08.720
 That's 100% true, 100%.

1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:15.440
 It attracts usually people that have not figured out a way to succeed, or haven't succeeded

1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:18.040
 on the level that they want to.

1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:26.680
 But that also being true, there is a fair amount of fuckery going on and provable, and

1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:34.640
 we just have to, I think, separate, know that these things are often inflated or not true,

1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:36.160
 but know that sometimes they are true.

1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:38.040
 Otherwise, it wouldn't exist.

1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:44.720
 If there was nothing to JFK, if there was nothing to 911, if people felt like they were

1:39:44.720 --> 1:39:48.000
 being dealt with honestly, this wouldn't exist.

1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.560
 This exists because there are real questions that people have that don't get answered for

1:39:52.560 --> 1:39:57.840
 whatever reason, and then the vacuum of the refusal to answer those questions, that information

1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:03.000
 vacuum, is filled with people like Alex Jones, who are curious, and sometimes they're right,

1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:07.000
 and sometimes they're horribly wrong, and sometimes they're all over the place.

1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:10.680
 They're good storytellers, and people love stories, and then when there's an absence

1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:11.680
 of actual...

1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:14.800
 Alex is a uniquely American person, very interesting.

1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:16.120
 I don't know how many countries...

1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:18.200
 How many people make a living as a conspiracy theorist?

1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:20.120
 A good living in other countries.

1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:21.120
 It's very rare.

1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:22.680
 I mean, it's very interesting.

1:40:22.680 --> 1:40:23.680
 He became...

1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:27.600
 I know people that knew him when he was a kid, because I go to Austin and perform a lot.

1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:31.040
 He was a guy that would take a bullhorn and yell at cops because he thought Dewey checkpoints

1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:32.040
 were unconstitutional.

1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:34.080
 That's what he was doing in college.

1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:35.080
 He just went through...

1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:36.080
 He was hated by the right.

1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:37.240
 He was hated by the Bush people.

1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:38.600
 He was hated by the...

1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:44.520
 When he went from being this guy that was considered a leftist even, even though he's

1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:51.160
 never a leftist, he was considered this enemy of mainstream conservatism.

1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:52.160
 He was not...

1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:56.120
 He considered a guy that wasn't a patriot, wasn't this, wasn't that?

1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:57.120
 He just...

1:40:57.120 --> 1:40:58.120
 Wow!

1:40:58.120 --> 1:41:02.640
 He whines, and whines, and ends up just being this confidant of a Republican president, very

1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:06.480
 divisive Republican president, and he becomes this populist and everything like that.

1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:08.120
 It's really wild to watch that.

1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:12.480
 I mean, I do think he should retire eventually, just so we could get some, I don't know.

1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:14.840
 It seems like it's a lot to keep doing.

1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:20.040
 Well, I hope this world allows for Alex Jones to continue having a voice, because just like

1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:28.600
 you said, he used the word fun, but really he shakes up the norms of our discourse.

1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:29.600
 I do too.

1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:30.600
 I do too.

1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:31.600
 I do think we need to put more value.

1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:32.600
 I think entertainment...

1:41:32.600 --> 1:41:36.720
 We do need to say that there are people that should be allowed to have a voice for entertainment

1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:37.720
 purposes.

1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:38.720
 Right.

1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:39.720
 And that's part...

1:41:39.720 --> 1:41:44.040
 And that's part of what Donald Trump, now that he's not the president, come on.

1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:45.240
 Let the guy...

1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:46.240
 Let him talk.

1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:48.840
 Who do you think is the best comedian of all time?

1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:51.400
 Oh, that's a great question.

1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:53.040
 Greatest of all time.

1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:57.280
 You mentioned Carlin, your uncle's like in Carlin.

1:41:57.280 --> 1:42:01.080
 Well, Carlin is great.

1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:08.960
 Carlin is really hard to argue with, but Chappelle is also really great.

1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:11.000
 Louis C.K. is really great.

1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.400
 I don't know that there's what Joan Rivers is great.

1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:16.480
 No, you smile at that.

1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:18.240
 She's a beast of a comic.

1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:19.720
 I'm not aware of her standup, actually.

1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:20.720
 She's a beast of a comic.

1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:23.320
 Ask Rogue and ask any of them.

1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:24.320
 Keneson's great.

1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:29.160
 So what makes a great comic, do you think, in the history of comedy?

1:42:29.160 --> 1:42:36.240
 Said something at the moment in a way, found a way to communicate with people in the funniest

1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:44.200
 possible way at that moment and illustrated larger truths about life in what they did.

1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:50.520
 And I think that guys like Louis and Chappelle and Pryor and Keneson and Hicks, people like

1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:53.200
 Joan Rivers have done that.

1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:57.800
 And even modern people, people like Maria Bamford is an amazing comedian.

1:42:57.800 --> 1:43:03.240
 It's just a different style of comedy per se, but she's an amazing comedian.

1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:05.400
 Cat Williams is an amazing comedian.

1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:06.400
 He really is.

1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:07.400
 Does he have any...

1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:11.200
 Well, see, the one of the things you've kind of mentioned, the comedies you mentioned,

1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:15.360
 they were kind of fearless in saying the difficult thing that needs to be said is Cat

1:43:15.360 --> 1:43:16.360
 Williams is more...

1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:20.520
 I don't remember his comedy, but I think it's just more wild out there.

1:43:20.520 --> 1:43:22.640
 Well, to an extent that you can watch it, he's got stuff.

1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:23.640
 He talks about stuff.

1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:24.920
 He talks about race brilliantly.

1:43:24.920 --> 1:43:26.520
 He talks about America brilliantly.

1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:28.440
 No, I think there's a lot of stuff there.

1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:29.440
 Of course, Chris Rock.

1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:30.440
 Of course, of course.

1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:31.440
 It's so hard.

1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:32.440
 You can't really pick one.

1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:33.440
 You just got to...

1:43:33.440 --> 1:43:37.360
 There's a class of people that throughout this history of this business, which is not

1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:38.360
 that long of a history.

1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:45.040
 It's pretty much within the last century that have been really influential.

1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:47.320
 Sometimes it's style, the way they deliver things.

1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:52.200
 Sometimes it's substance of what they're saying or sometimes it's just a style of what they're

1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:53.200
 saying.

1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:55.200
 I mean, and we're only talking about standup comedians, right?

1:43:55.200 --> 1:43:56.680
 So there's a million great comedians.

1:43:56.680 --> 1:44:00.480
 I mean, if we're going to talk about Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler and Chris Farley,

1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:01.840
 I mean, these are brilliant.

1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:06.320
 And those guys are bigger influences on comedy, I think, than standups, really, truly.

1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:09.600
 So there's so many brilliant people in the business.

1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:12.440
 Who was for you influential, just the early on?

1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:15.960
 Picks was influential because I'd watch Bill Hicks and I'd be like, this guy's saying crazy

1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:18.720
 shit on stage and this is the only way he can get away with it.

1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:20.240
 His business is so funny.

1:44:20.240 --> 1:44:24.720
 And he was calling out the military industrial complex and he was talking about the First

1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:25.720
 Gulf War.

1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:27.280
 I remember he said a joke that I heard.

1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:28.280
 It made me sit up straight.

1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:31.240
 He goes, he goes, he was in Canada and he said, we had a war in the States.

1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:33.200
 He was talking about the First Gulf War.

1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:39.140
 And he said, I was in the unenviable position of being for the war, but against the troops.

1:44:39.140 --> 1:44:40.640
 And to me, I love that joke.

1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:41.640
 It was so funny to me.

1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:46.760
 And I was like, oh, you can't get away with that anywhere other than standing on a stage.

1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:48.880
 You couldn't ever say that in an office, really.

1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:50.880
 And this was before like it was like PC.

1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:55.520
 And there's that the other thing I always knew the comedians had to say shit and have

1:44:55.520 --> 1:44:58.960
 it be funny enough that you couldn't get away with it in polite society.

1:44:58.960 --> 1:44:59.960
 That was the whole point.

1:44:59.960 --> 1:45:02.400
 That was why it was a dark theater or a dark nightclub.

1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:04.120
 That's when people had a few drinks.

1:45:04.120 --> 1:45:05.240
 That's what the art form was.

1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:09.920
 And that's why, so a guy like that was influential because I started watching him.

1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:13.280
 And of course, like, you know, I loved SNL when I was a kid and I would watch Chris Farley

1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:18.000
 and I would watch, you know, people like even John Belushi going back in the day, but I'd

1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:21.080
 watch Adam Sandler and Will Farrell and all these guys.

1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:23.280
 I mean, there's so many funny people.

1:45:23.280 --> 1:45:24.880
 But Bill Hicks was kind of funny.

1:45:24.880 --> 1:45:28.720
 And then Patrice O Neal was like probably my favorite comedian who's made me laugh more

1:45:28.720 --> 1:45:31.160
 than anybody else.

1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:35.760
 I think it was you actually that maybe on your podcast, we're talking about Patrice

1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:40.120
 O Neal and that he was actually vicious to others.

1:45:40.120 --> 1:45:43.760
 I think he was a little mean to other people, but he was very good to people that he liked.

1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:47.120
 I guess I think he was like not, I mean, he wasn't and I'd never met him.

1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:51.600
 I have no inside info, but from what I've heard, he was like, no nonsense guy, right?

1:45:51.600 --> 1:45:53.280
 He just said what he wanted to say.

1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:58.360
 But I think in terms of comedians, I don't know of anyone funnier than Patrice O Neal

1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:03.120
 who said in modern times that said more about our society than him.

1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:06.000
 I mean, he was just a brilliantly funny guy on the radio.

1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:07.800
 He was funny on his specials.

1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:09.400
 He was funny everywhere.

1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:10.400
 He was funny.

1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:14.560
 And there's something else to be said about the whole medium of comedians doing podcasts.

1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:15.560
 Yeah.

1:46:15.560 --> 1:46:20.280
 I think it's a, it unlocks a weird special new thing that changed everything.

1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:22.840
 I mean, Rogan started with that.

1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:25.320
 You're doing that.

1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:29.840
 I think that's a whole nother form of like stand ups.

1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:37.320
 The ones that have a lot to say, almost like we get to witness the process of the creation

1:46:37.320 --> 1:46:44.040
 of the jokes in a way or the mind, the sort of the evolution of the mind behind the jokes.

1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:47.640
 Which is comedians relate to social media.

1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:52.240
 Comedians, comedies, it's a performance based medium.

1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:56.080
 So it's about getting up and doing it, getting up in a club, getting up in a theater, getting

1:46:56.080 --> 1:46:59.080
 up in a bar, getting up wherever you can get up.

1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:03.200
 And comedy for years was about performance.

1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:06.760
 And then on the higher end, it was about movies and TV shows.

1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:09.640
 But we were very slow to get on YouTube.

1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:12.040
 We were very slow to adapt to technology.

1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:16.600
 We were very slow to monetize anything we did on the internet.

1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:22.600
 So podcasting was a way for comics and funny people to kind of get into that space, start

1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:23.760
 earning money.

1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:27.200
 And now, because of the pandemic, it's really become essential.

1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:28.200
 And it helps you.

1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:32.760
 And even without the pandemic, it was where people, it was how you were building a fanbase.

1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:36.800
 And that's like, you know, but comics were very reticent to embrace social media at all

1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:39.960
 because they thought it was cheap and they didn't like it.

1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:42.400
 And they thought the people on it were idiots and were unfunny.

1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:45.760
 And it was just a blatant, you know, whatever it was, whether it was a money grab or it

1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:49.920
 was just too commercial and in the sense where they're like, hey, look at me.

1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:52.960
 Like it was just goofy, right?

1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:59.160
 And then comics, I think, got displaced because all the YouTubers came in and all the social

1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:00.480
 media stars came in.

1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:05.400
 And they really knocked comics off because now people are much more like, if you ask

1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:08.520
 anyone under 30 who their favorite comedian is, they say, David Dobrik.

1:48:08.520 --> 1:48:09.840
 And there's nothing wrong with that.

1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:16.880
 David's a funny guy, but like what you, you know, I'm not especially to me a ton, but

1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:17.880
 that's okay.

1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:19.760
 I don't, you know, but he makes people laugh.

1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:21.760
 So he's funny.

1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:24.880
 But he's what people, you know, that's a comedian now.

1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:31.880
 So comics got beat by other people coming into a digital space before they did laying

1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:35.120
 the groundwork and taking it over.

1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:38.560
 And now comics are just trying to stay alive.

1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:41.480
 And even my podcast, which is people really like it.

1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:42.480
 Thank God.

1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:43.480
 And I love doing it.

1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:44.480
 The Tim Dillon Show.

1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:47.240
 Well, thank you.

1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:48.640
 I was late.

1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:52.320
 You know, I mean, I was, I just, you know, I've been podcasting for a long time, but

1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:54.760
 really dedicating myself and putting the resources behind it.

1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:55.760
 I was late to it.

1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:59.400
 Like I was like, Hey, I'm, I'm telling jokes on stage, which is great, but I should have

1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:03.480
 been allocating more time to building an infrastructure online and I wasn't doing it.

1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:04.880
 And a lot of comics weren't doing it.

1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:06.720
 Funny comics weren't doing it.

1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:08.720
 It should be doing it.

1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:12.240
 And I think when the pandemic ends, a lot of comics will just keep doing live standup.

1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:15.240
 But I will keep, obviously I'm going to go back on the road and do live standup, but

1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:17.640
 I will keep doing this podcast and building digitally too.

1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:19.280
 But you're also exploring ideas.

1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:22.160
 You're doing like short videos and so on.

1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:27.280
 You're trying to look for different mediums of how to be funny everywhere.

1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:28.280
 I want to be funny everywhere.

1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:29.520
 I love making things too.

1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:34.720
 My producer, Ben Avery is like a brilliant editor and comedic mind, even though he's

1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:36.320
 not a standup.

1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:39.280
 He's able to, he understands funny, he understands what makes me funny.

1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:43.480
 We're able to make these really, I mean, some of those videos, they're just brilliant little

1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:47.640
 videos, even though they're tiny little videos, they're fucking as funny as anything.

1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:52.960
 And it's not me, it's me working with somebody else to make something really great.

1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:55.640
 And if, and, and it's that relationship that's very important.

1:49:55.640 --> 1:50:00.560
 Well, in some sense, the, the medium of a short video is a challenge, just like the

1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:04.680
 medium of a short tweet of how to say something.

1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:09.920
 I mean, whatever the flavor is of what's in your heart, what's in your mind, how to

1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:15.760
 say it, whether it's the goal is funny or something, or just an expressing idea.

1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:20.400
 I think it's the whole thing that's important to us is that it's an extension of really

1:50:20.400 --> 1:50:22.440
 like an extension of your friendship in a way.

1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:24.600
 Like are you guys laughing at it?

1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:28.000
 Are you guys making each other laugh about this idea?

1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:31.720
 And if that's the case, other people are going to laugh at it, you know?

1:50:31.720 --> 1:50:35.360
 I think so much of the old medium was like, everything was top down.

1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:36.360
 Okay.

1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:37.360
 Pitch me this idea.

1:50:37.360 --> 1:50:38.680
 I pitch it to the showrunner.

1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:39.920
 They pitch it to the network.

1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:44.120
 They pitch it to this, to that, to that, you know, standards and practices, sales, and

1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:45.560
 you know, we got to go through everything.

1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:51.360
 Now it's just like, are me and a few buddies or even just one buddy laughing at this idea?

1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:52.800
 Does it captivate us?

1:50:52.800 --> 1:50:55.160
 And do we see it visually?

1:50:55.160 --> 1:51:01.400
 And also a great line from Roseanne, a guy, not Roseanne, but a guy that worked on Roseanne.

1:51:01.400 --> 1:51:06.000
 The old Roseanne, the great one, he said, is it funny with the sound off?

1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:07.000
 Right.

1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.000
 That's what we try to do.

1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:09.000
 That's brilliant.

1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:10.000
 Is it funny with the sound off?

1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:15.200
 When you see me and the dumb things or me and the Meghan McCain or me and the thing,

1:51:15.200 --> 1:51:16.200
 is it funny with the sound off?

1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:18.720
 And if it's funny with the sound off, you have a good starting point.

1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:19.720
 That's hilarious.

1:51:19.720 --> 1:51:24.640
 Because you, I would say you're one of the people, because most people are not funny

1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:28.960
 with the sound or most comedians, like you will fail is another example that there's

1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:34.280
 something about when I click on one of your videos, it's funny, just like the first thing

1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:35.280
 I see.

1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:36.280
 Yeah.

1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:37.280
 Just your face.

1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:38.280
 Well, thank you.

1:51:38.280 --> 1:51:39.280
 That's very sweet.

1:51:39.280 --> 1:51:40.280
 But I mean, thank God.

1:51:40.280 --> 1:51:41.680
 I mean, that's what we try to do, right?

1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:42.680
 We're trying to be funny.

1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:43.680
 Yeah.

1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:44.680
 So we're trying to be funny.

1:51:44.680 --> 1:51:47.240
 Can we talk about love a little bit?

1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:48.240
 Sure.

1:51:48.240 --> 1:51:53.400
 So you came out of the closet as being gay when you were 25.

1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:54.400
 Yeah.

1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:55.400
 It was late.

1:51:55.400 --> 1:51:56.400
 Very late.

1:51:56.400 --> 1:51:57.400
 Very late.

1:51:57.400 --> 1:51:59.280
 And what were your standards?

1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:00.640
 During and after.

1:52:00.640 --> 1:52:04.020
 How has your view on love evolved?

1:52:04.020 --> 1:52:05.020
 Interesting.

1:52:05.020 --> 1:52:12.200
 It's so hard to say, because I would, I would like to make a very Disney Fide statement

1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:15.820
 about that you can't be in love secretively.

1:52:15.820 --> 1:52:16.820
 You should be honest.

1:52:16.820 --> 1:52:17.920
 Love should all be about honesty.

1:52:17.920 --> 1:52:19.920
 But that's not true, right?

1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:25.880
 There's people that are in love that are lying to everyone else, but they're deeply in love.

1:52:25.880 --> 1:52:31.040
 I would love to say something like honesty is an ingredient for love, but I don't know.

1:52:31.040 --> 1:52:35.840
 Maybe honesty with each other, but I think there's a lot of people in the world that

1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:37.080
 aren't honest.

1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:39.000
 My view on love is super important.

1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:44.920
 I think that a lot of society in America is all about love.

1:52:44.920 --> 1:52:54.680
 We don't tend to focus on other things in terms of friendship or sustainability of that

1:52:54.680 --> 1:53:00.640
 because I know a lot of people in relationships where it's like, I don't know, they love

1:53:00.640 --> 1:53:08.440
 each other, but it's also a rock solid couple because they're very compatible in many other

1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:09.440
 ways.

1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:10.440
 Right.

1:53:10.440 --> 1:53:11.440
 They're friends.

1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:14.040
 I see friendship and love as the same thing.

1:53:14.040 --> 1:53:16.200
 There's this part of it that are, right?

1:53:16.200 --> 1:53:24.640
 I look at it as like, there needs to be more than just that amazing chemistry or physical

1:53:24.640 --> 1:53:28.560
 attraction that is this chemical thing that happens.

1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:33.440
 There should be like some underlying, I mean, again, that's from what I, that's what I've

1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:37.400
 observed as really long lasting successful relationships.

1:53:37.400 --> 1:53:47.560
 Well, is there something about coming out that you took away that you remember as profound

1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:48.560
 and siphoned?

1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:49.560
 Yes.

1:53:49.560 --> 1:53:55.120
 And I, it wasn't society, it was me, so there were kids that were out in my high school

1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:58.640
 that I waited years later to do it.

1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:00.600
 That was no one's fault but my own.

1:54:00.600 --> 1:54:06.040
 So I was taking a cowardly way out and a lot of people, so I could blame society or like,

1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:11.000
 oh, I lived in a conservative area and I grew up in, you should take responsibility for

1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:12.000
 your own decisions.

1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.520
 And if you're being cowardly, admit that you're being cowardly.

1:54:14.520 --> 1:54:18.680
 So that's what I took out of it is that it's not society's fault that you chose to be

1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:19.680
 a coward.

1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:21.200
 Society will never be perfect.

1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:25.200
 You have to be honest when you're ready to be honest or however you want to be honest,

1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:30.040
 but it's not somebody, too much now is it's everyone else's fault that you didn't take,

1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:31.640
 make a hard choice or a hard decision.

1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:33.840
 So that's kind of what I took out of it.

1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:39.640
 So now in retrospect, you see yourself as, or being afraid, do you, do you think at the

1:54:39.640 --> 1:54:40.640
 time?

1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:45.080
 Well, I wanted people to like me, which is the, which is the disease of humanity, right?

1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:48.720
 The disease that we want to be liked and what happens is if you want people to like you

1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:51.960
 and love you even, you want people to feel comfortable with you.

1:54:51.960 --> 1:54:54.200
 And those were people like your family?

1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:55.200
 Friends more.

1:54:55.200 --> 1:54:59.560
 My family I would always, you know, could always throw in the street, but I'm kidding.

1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:04.920
 I mean, but I am not, but my friends, my circle of friends, which I were my family at the

1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:09.240
 time when you're senior, when you're 10th, 11th grade in high school, your, your friends

1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:10.240
 are your family.

1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:11.240
 You know what I mean?

1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:14.000
 Like that's your, so you don't want to do anything that puts you on the outside of

1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:15.360
 the circle.

1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:20.960
 So thinking back to that fear, is there things you're afraid of now that you're not doing,

1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:21.960
 you're afraid to do?

1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:24.000
 I'm afraid of all kinds of things.

1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:30.800
 I'm afraid of not being good at my job, not being funny, letting people down, not putting

1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:36.040
 out products that are good, you know, whether it's the podcast every week or stand up or

1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:37.040
 the videos.

1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:40.240
 Like I'm afraid of like, there's a ton of people that really enjoy what we do.

1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:44.520
 So when you're in that position, you're nervous that you're going to start doing things that

1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:45.520
 they don't like.

1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:49.000
 So the new things you want to do, the evolution you want to do, you want to make sure you're

1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.160
 evolving in the right way.

1:55:50.160 --> 1:55:53.440
 You know, you want to make sure that you're doing things that are consistent with why

1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:54.600
 people liked you.

1:55:54.600 --> 1:55:59.800
 But also you don't want to put yourself in a box and limit what you can be going forward.

1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:04.880
 So like I had a talk with the CEO of NBC Universal once, I was doing some internal sketch for

1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:09.920
 them and I was playing like a cab driver and he was a, and he's not the current CEO, but

1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:10.920
 he's a former CEO.

1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:14.360
 And I said to him, what's the hardest part of running a corporation of this size?

1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:17.160
 And he said something very interesting.

1:56:17.160 --> 1:56:22.720
 He said, the hardest part is maximizing the current profit model of what you have at the

1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.520
 same time, getting ready, getting ready, getting the company ready for where it's going to

1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:27.920
 be in five years.

1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:29.840
 He said, those are often at odds.

1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:30.960
 And that's the toughest thing.

1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:34.440
 He goes, because I could just bang out everything I got to do right now and we're going to make

1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:38.320
 a lot of money doing this, but am I devoting enough resources into digital so that in five

1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:42.200
 years when that's where everything lives, are we competitive in that space?

1:56:42.200 --> 1:56:46.160
 So as funny as I am now, hopefully to people and a lot of the things that I want to do

1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:51.160
 now, I'm going, what am I, what groundwork am I not laying for three to five years down

1:56:51.160 --> 1:56:57.800
 the road so that I can be adapting to the trends that are important then in terms of

1:56:57.800 --> 1:57:03.880
 not so much comedic trends, but like the technological trends, like what is the, what

1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:04.880
 is it?

1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:06.440
 You know, I should have done podcasting earlier.

1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:09.120
 What should I, should I have a bigger presence on TikTok?

1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:10.120
 Should I have a bigger presence here?

1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:11.120
 Should I have a visitor?

1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:12.120
 Or should I be on Twitch?

1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:13.120
 Should I be doing this?

1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:14.120
 Should I be doing that?

1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:17.480
 What am I not doing that I should be doing that I'll regret not doing?

1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:21.400
 And those are, those are the conversations I think I have in my own head all the time.

1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:26.120
 And I guess there's parallels to coming out as gay or just parallels in like career paths

1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:28.080
 you're taking all that.

1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:29.680
 That's ultimately just fear.

1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:30.680
 It's fear.

1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:31.680
 Yeah.

1:57:31.680 --> 1:57:35.760
 It's the fear of, you know, the best thing that happened in my career was that I came

1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:41.720
 to LA, I didn't have an idea of what was going to happen.

1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:49.040
 I met somebody who was really committed to making funny things that we just wanted to

1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:50.120
 be funny.

1:57:50.120 --> 1:57:51.280
 No one would let us be funny.

1:57:51.280 --> 1:57:53.880
 We didn't have Comedy Central letting us be funny.

1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:54.880
 We didn't have HBO.

1:57:54.880 --> 1:57:55.880
 We didn't have Netflix.

1:57:55.880 --> 1:58:00.320
 We just had a garage and a phone in the beginning and then a camera and then a thing.

1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:01.960
 And we just wanted to be funny.

1:58:01.960 --> 1:58:05.720
 And that was the greatest risk really I took because I was like, well, I don't know what

1:58:05.720 --> 1:58:08.720
 else is going to happen right now, but I just want to be funny.

1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:09.720
 And funny saved my life.

1:58:09.720 --> 1:58:10.720
 Right?

1:58:10.720 --> 1:58:11.720
 I mean, funny got me out of drugs.

1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:13.080
 Funny probably got me out of the closet.

1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:16.840
 Funny was the thing that I was able to do that made everything okay in my own head.

1:58:16.840 --> 1:58:19.120
 So I was like, as long as I'm being funny, something good will happen.

1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:22.600
 So we did that and then something really cool happened that we were able to do a lot of

1:58:22.600 --> 1:58:23.600
 cool things.

1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:25.720
 But, you know, that's what it is.

1:58:25.720 --> 1:58:29.600
 It's fear that keeps you from being the better version of yourself.

1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:35.200
 Your mom, I mean, you have so many complicated, fascinating parts of your story.

1:58:35.200 --> 1:58:36.200
 Thank you.

1:58:36.200 --> 1:58:43.640
 Your mom, as you were growing up suffered from out to illness, yes, schizophrenia.

1:58:43.640 --> 1:58:46.920
 Can you tell her story and how that relationship has changed over the years?

1:58:46.920 --> 1:58:47.920
 Yeah.

1:58:47.920 --> 1:58:51.400
 Well, she was always eccentric and always, you know, the terms for schizophrenia in

1:58:51.400 --> 1:58:56.320
 an Irish Catholic household where we didn't talk about anything were eccentric, fun.

1:58:56.320 --> 1:58:57.320
 She's fun.

1:58:57.320 --> 1:58:59.520
 There's a theme to this conversation.

1:58:59.520 --> 1:59:00.520
 Unpredictable.

1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:08.880
 She's a live wire, any of the words you would use to describe somebody who is a fucking lunatic,

1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:11.520
 but you wouldn't say that.

1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:19.040
 She started experiencing symptoms probably early on in her life, but she also, like,

1:59:19.040 --> 1:59:24.800
 I think, started really manifesting them when I was in my mid teens.

1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:29.600
 So like 14, 13, 14 area.

1:59:29.600 --> 1:59:33.720
 And she got really, really bad and then I think she was institutionalized about 10 years

1:59:33.720 --> 1:59:36.160
 ago, a little over 10 years ago.

1:59:36.160 --> 1:59:37.760
 And she could really no longer live on her own.

1:59:37.760 --> 1:59:39.560
 She was unable to go to work.

1:59:39.560 --> 1:59:40.560
 She was unable to function.

1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:42.040
 So I visit her when I can.

1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:43.040
 Obviously, I'm not in New York.

1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:44.600
 Whenever I go to New York, I visit her.

1:59:44.600 --> 1:59:47.080
 She's aware of what I do, my career and everything like that.

1:59:47.080 --> 1:59:50.840
 You know, she has good days and bad days, but, you know, mental illness is a thing that's

1:59:50.840 --> 1:59:51.840
 very tough.

1:59:51.840 --> 1:59:53.440
 We don't talk about it as a society.

1:59:53.440 --> 1:59:57.280
 People with mental problems don't get that much attention.

1:59:57.280 --> 2:00:03.000
 We tend to think that they did something wrong or that they deserve it or that they are,

2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:07.240
 you know, to be ignored and we don't devote a lot of resources into it, which is unfortunate

2:00:07.240 --> 2:00:11.400
 because then you have the junk gurus come in and go like, let's diagnose your mental

2:00:11.400 --> 2:00:12.400
 illness off Instagram.

2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:14.480
 And it's like, that's not the move.

2:00:14.480 --> 2:00:15.480
 Yeah.

2:00:15.480 --> 2:00:17.480
 Do you love her?

2:00:17.480 --> 2:00:18.480
 I do.

2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:19.480
 I do.

2:00:19.480 --> 2:00:24.360
 I love her, but I also remember her that isn't her now.

2:00:24.360 --> 2:00:30.360
 And when someone has mental illness that's severe, you make peace with their death before

2:00:30.360 --> 2:00:40.960
 they die because the part of them that you love and remember a lot of cases is not evident

2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:41.960
 or obvious.

2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:48.600
 Now, my mother's still a loving person that I love, but the fun, her ability to be present

2:00:48.600 --> 2:00:55.320
 in the moment and to not, you know, that is lost with the progression of illness so that

2:00:55.320 --> 2:00:56.480
 you still love her.

2:00:56.480 --> 2:01:00.440
 And I mean, again, you know, your parents, you know, the time horizons you have with

2:01:00.440 --> 2:01:01.880
 your parents are unknown.

2:01:01.880 --> 2:01:02.880
 People don't know.

2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:05.320
 You could, you know, I have friends that their parents were in their lives for their entire

2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:06.320
 life.

2:01:06.320 --> 2:01:09.280
 And I have friends whose parents were in their life, but my mother was a very, she knew what

2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:10.680
 I was when I was a little kid.

2:01:10.680 --> 2:01:11.680
 I was an actor.

2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:14.480
 When I was like six to 12, my mother knew that I was a performer.

2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:16.480
 She knew what I was and what I'd ultimately do.

2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:17.680
 She recognized that in me.

2:01:17.680 --> 2:01:19.320
 When I said to her, I want to audition for shows.

2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:20.320
 I want to be on stage.

2:01:20.320 --> 2:01:21.320
 I want to be on this.

2:01:21.320 --> 2:01:22.320
 I want to do this.

2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:26.080
 She let me do it because she knew who I was and she didn't want to get in the way of me

2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:30.760
 being a human being, a fully realized person at six.

2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:36.280
 So that's probably the best thing a parent can do for a kid is let them be who they are.

2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:37.880
 And my mother did that.

2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:40.760
 So that, I mean, that's good.

2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:42.880
 We ate too much fast food.

2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:44.640
 There were negatives, but she did let me be.

2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:47.040
 Well, that's why you want to throw them out into the street.

2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:48.040
 Sometimes.

2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:59.720
 But coming, coming to accept the mortality of her, I guess identity as you remember it

2:01:59.720 --> 2:02:04.360
 from childhood, do you ponder your own mortality?

2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:06.080
 Are you afraid of death?

2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:07.080
 I'm afraid of death.

2:02:07.080 --> 2:02:10.000
 I don't like the idea of death, but I know what's happening.

2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.360
 You know, I know it's going to happen eventually.

2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:14.160
 I don't think about it.

2:02:14.160 --> 2:02:17.000
 I think about, I want to do some good stuff that people can look back at.

2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:18.000
 And I think I'm proud.

2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.720
 I'm proud of the show where if people look back at the show, I don't know how comedy

2:02:20.720 --> 2:02:21.720
 ages or whatever.

2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:24.840
 But like, I think I put out a lot of stuff and I want to continue to put out stuff and

2:02:24.840 --> 2:02:28.200
 I want to put out a few specials that people can look back at and go, oh, this guy was

2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:30.440
 really funny in this really crazy.

2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:34.000
 You know, he lived in the latter part of this century when all this shit was going on and

2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:40.840
 he kind of made fun of it and he did something to make people's lives a little better just

2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:43.600
 by having, you know, a few laughs, you know?

2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:50.000
 Well, do you think about, this is something like in the podcast context, do you think

2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:56.120
 you'll have just one or two or three shows out of thousands maybe that are like the truly

2:02:56.120 --> 2:02:57.120
 special ones?

2:02:57.120 --> 2:02:58.120
 That's probably the case.

2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:00.680
 Or do you think it's an entirety of the body of work?

2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:05.280
 I think people will take 10 minute clips from all different shows and put them together

2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:06.280
 in this highlight.

2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:07.280
 Yeah.

2:03:07.280 --> 2:03:10.840
 Like a highlight reel of just like these are like the best things that he's ever done

2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:13.560
 or the best rants he's ever had, the best things, whatever.

2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:18.840
 So the legacy would be that this was an important voice in a very weird time.

2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:21.560
 I would hope that that's part of it.

2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:27.160
 And I hope that I continue to be, you know, you say important, I say funny, but hopefully

2:03:27.160 --> 2:03:28.560
 I continue to be a voice.

2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:32.560
 And that's what I think when I think about death, I think about like, what did people

2:03:32.560 --> 2:03:33.560
 come on earth to do?

2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:39.440
 And I think I came, I think my main purpose on this planet other than to experience whatever

2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:44.960
 love or, you know, worthiness or whatever is to make, to entertain people and there's

2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:50.040
 a lot of people in comedy right now that are not entertainers and that's really the problem.

2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:54.320
 But and they got into comedy sort of the way that, you know, you can walk into the wrong

2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:58.480
 store in a mall and then not realize you're in the wrong store and try on a bunch of clothes

2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:01.040
 and then go, fuck, I wasted my whole afternoon.

2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:04.480
 But I think I've always kind of been an entertainer and that's what I want to do.

2:04:04.480 --> 2:04:09.240
 There's unfortunately, sadly, a lot of people that look up to you, there you go.

2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:13.160
 That is a horrible thing, but life is a nightmare.

2:04:13.160 --> 2:04:14.520
 Yeah.

2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:20.520
 If you were to give them advice, young folks, people in college, maybe even high school,

2:04:20.520 --> 2:04:25.640
 but people in their 20s about what to do with their life, whether it's career, whether it's

2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:28.200
 just life in general, what would you say?

2:04:28.200 --> 2:04:35.760
 Ignore everyone, make a few good friends, truly have honest conversations with yourself

2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:42.880
 about your, when do you feel the most alive?

2:04:42.880 --> 2:04:44.640
 Figure that out.

2:04:44.640 --> 2:04:48.760
 When and how do you feel the most alive?

2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:50.480
 Figure that out.

2:04:50.480 --> 2:04:56.440
 Try to figure out a job or a career that can replicate that feeling.

2:04:56.440 --> 2:04:57.600
 Don't listen to anyone.

2:04:57.600 --> 2:04:59.000
 Don't listen to your parents.

2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:01.320
 Don't listen to the gurus on the internet.

2:05:01.320 --> 2:05:02.720
 Don't listen to me.

2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:04.360
 Don't listen to anyone.

2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:07.600
 Figure out where you feel the most alive.

2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:09.800
 Where do you feel excited?

2:05:09.800 --> 2:05:11.800
 Where does your pulse quicken?

2:05:11.800 --> 2:05:13.920
 What do you feel matters?

2:05:13.920 --> 2:05:17.440
 When you're in a situation, do you feel like it matters?

2:05:17.440 --> 2:05:18.920
 What situation was that?

2:05:18.920 --> 2:05:20.760
 What got you excited?

2:05:20.760 --> 2:05:26.120
 What thing did you walk into where you looked around and were taken back and you're like,

2:05:26.120 --> 2:05:27.280
 wow, this is amazing.

2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:29.120
 I'm filled with awe.

2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:35.760
 If you can figure out a life where you can excite yourself, you might not use drugs or

2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:41.160
 alcohol or a sex addiction or gambling or irresponsibility.

2:05:41.160 --> 2:05:47.120
 You might not have to get your fucking kicks in very destructive places if you can get

2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:49.600
 them in a productive place.

2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:57.120
 You had a pretty weaving life that's full of mistakes and so on.

2:05:57.120 --> 2:05:59.800
 Any mistakes?

2:05:59.800 --> 2:06:02.400
 Is our mistakes a bug or a feature?

2:06:02.400 --> 2:06:06.040
 Do you recommend embrace the mistakes and make a bunch of them?

2:06:06.040 --> 2:06:08.680
 It depends what they are.

2:06:08.680 --> 2:06:09.880
 You've had the full spectrum.

2:06:09.880 --> 2:06:13.520
 I've had a lot, but a lot of mine could have sunk me.

2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:19.000
 They sound like fun when I talk about them, but they actually could have sunk me.

2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:22.680
 They were all part of what made me funny, but I don't know.

2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:27.920
 I would never tell anyone else to just light their life on fire and hope it all works out

2:06:27.920 --> 2:06:28.920
 on the other end.

2:06:28.920 --> 2:06:31.080
 It would be pretty irresponsible.

2:06:31.080 --> 2:06:40.320
 But hey, at the end of the day, it's like, you're going to... I think one of my themes

2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:41.800
 is that there's too much.

2:06:41.800 --> 2:06:42.800
 We give the power.

2:06:42.800 --> 2:06:49.400
 We think we have to... The power of choice has been elevated in our society to an unhealthy

2:06:49.400 --> 2:06:50.400
 degree.

2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:56.080
 I think you could get really good at something, but you're born with a certain aptitude.

2:06:56.080 --> 2:06:59.680
 It might be to be a dealmaker, might be to be an athlete, it might be to be an artist,

2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:03.400
 it might be to be a romantic, just fall in and out of love, in and out of love, in and

2:07:03.400 --> 2:07:04.400
 out of love.

2:07:04.400 --> 2:07:08.800
 It might be to be a world traveler, but whatever you are, I think you are.

2:07:08.800 --> 2:07:12.760
 I think that there's something about you that makes you something, and if you can figure

2:07:12.760 --> 2:07:16.640
 it out and then refine... You're not going to be good at it, per se, but if you're an

2:07:16.640 --> 2:07:20.680
 athlete, it might not mean that you're going to be a great athlete in the history, but

2:07:20.680 --> 2:07:24.840
 it might mean you're the best coach anyone's ever had, or you're the person that builds

2:07:24.840 --> 2:07:27.520
 a local scene for young athletes or whatever.

2:07:27.520 --> 2:07:31.560
 If you are a really good dealmaker, it doesn't mean you're going to be Warren Buffett, but

2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:37.200
 it might mean you're somebody who enjoys making deals all the time and things like that.

2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:40.920
 If you're an entertainer, it might mean that you are an entertainer.

2:07:40.920 --> 2:07:45.400
 It might mean that you are in the world of entertainment because you love it so much

2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:50.520
 that if you lack the skill set to really pursue it on a degree, you just want to be... There's

2:07:50.520 --> 2:07:55.840
 a thing inside of you that makes you what you are.

2:07:55.840 --> 2:07:58.600
 I look at certain people and I go, you were born to be that thing.

2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:01.200
 The whole purpose is to find it.

2:08:01.200 --> 2:08:06.040
 I was a juror on a murder trial in Long Island, and the woman who's the DA, I'm like, you

2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:07.320
 were born to do this.

2:08:07.320 --> 2:08:12.160
 You were born to put murderers away, and this guy killed the mother of his children.

2:08:12.160 --> 2:08:15.640
 That means a bad guy, but I was like, you are really good at what you do.

2:08:15.640 --> 2:08:20.560
 She has a strong belief in whatever her moral code is and what her justice and ethics are,

2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:22.120
 and she wants to communicate that to people.

2:08:22.120 --> 2:08:25.760
 She was very good at doing what she did.

2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:26.960
 I don't know the facts of the case.

2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:27.960
 I didn't really listen.

2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:32.400
 He seemed guilty, so I just voted guilty, but I didn't really listen to her, but I heard

2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:35.440
 the shape of her mouth was very bovine, like a cow.

2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:38.880
 It conferred a certain level of expertise that I enjoyed.

2:08:38.880 --> 2:08:43.800
 Well, it's funny, you could see you're half joking.

2:08:43.800 --> 2:08:47.920
 You can often see that people just, they found their place.

2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:48.920
 They found their role.

2:08:48.920 --> 2:08:49.920
 They found their thing.

2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:52.480
 They found their thing, and that's kind of the purpose of life.

2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:59.720
 Once you are in a place that seems sticky, like the place that seems right, this is one

2:08:59.720 --> 2:09:03.440
 of the problems with the generation that you're speaking to is there's always a feeling like

2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:08.480
 I should keep exploring, keep exploring, but it's okay to stay in a place that you found

2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:09.480
 that works.

2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:10.480
 Yeah.

2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:14.360
 And listen, sometimes the best place you'll find is when people are like, when did you

2:09:14.360 --> 2:09:16.000
 feel really excited and alive?

2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:17.600
 It's like doing nothing.

2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:18.600
 Right.

2:09:18.600 --> 2:09:19.600
 Yeah.

2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:20.600
 You know?

2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:21.600
 That's the other thing.

2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:24.000
 It's like some people are going to be like, I feel really excited and alive, and I'm laying

2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:28.520
 in my backyard in a hammock, and I just wanted the simplest life and not have to do much,

2:09:28.520 --> 2:09:32.480
 and I don't like doing anything, and I love laying around and going, wow, this guy looks

2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:33.480
 good today.

2:09:33.480 --> 2:09:36.400
 Bill Gates goes, this guy looks good today, let's shoot a missile into it.

2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:37.400
 He wants to do shit.

2:09:37.400 --> 2:09:38.400
 Right?

2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:42.280
 So it's like in between that and nothing is you can find something.

2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:48.640
 But in that process, for you personally, I mean, for me and for others, I think there's

2:09:48.640 --> 2:09:49.640
 a struggle.

2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:53.440
 When you look in the, when Tim Dillon looks in the mirror, do you love yourself or do

2:09:53.440 --> 2:09:54.440
 you hate yourself?

2:09:54.440 --> 2:10:00.320
 Well, a lot of times I think I'm in me shumer, so I'm confused.

2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:01.920
 I'm a detente with myself all the time.

2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:03.520
 I don't love myself or hate myself.

2:10:03.520 --> 2:10:09.560
 Things have a very bad problem where you can't just fall in love with yourself and you can't

2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:10.720
 hate yourself.

2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:12.840
 Both of them lead you to a negative place.

2:10:12.840 --> 2:10:14.720
 You try to stay kind of even keel.

2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:18.840
 I don't go like, hey, man, you put out a video, I got all these views, things are great, you

2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:22.360
 sold a bunch of tickets, let's fucking go out, like maybe let's say, hey, man, let's

2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:25.160
 have that drink that you've been waiting for for 11 years.

2:10:25.160 --> 2:10:28.720
 And I don't look at myself and go, you ate a burger yesterday, you're a piece of shit,

2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:33.240
 you're horrible, you'll never get into the shape you want.

2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:35.320
 I try not to get too low or too high.

2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:38.520
 Both of them are not good for my particular mind.

2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:45.520
 Okay, I got to ask, we were kind of spoke about 2021 and you being potentially hopeful.

2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:50.040
 Hopeful short term, cynical long term.

2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:54.080
 So let me ask, I forgot to ask, are you moving to Austin?

2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:58.920
 I don't know, I mean, I don't think so immediately, you know, I love Joe, I love what he's trying

2:10:58.920 --> 2:10:59.920
 to do down there.

2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:04.360
 I'm appreciative of everything that he's done for not only me, but for comedy in general.

2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:08.640
 And I think as things happen in Austin and unfold is such a political answer.

2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:11.440
 But as things unfold, I will consider it more and more.

2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:14.520
 But I mean, I think I got into the year in LA.

2:11:14.520 --> 2:11:19.640
 So you've spoken so nicely about this magical place that is Los Angeles.

2:11:19.640 --> 2:11:22.520
 LA is very funny.

2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:24.440
 You think there's a place for comedy in LA?

2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:25.440
 Oh yeah.

2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:27.480
 The Los Bia Place for Comedy in LA.

2:11:27.480 --> 2:11:29.600
 So it's going to be a place for comedy in New York.

2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:33.800
 I mean, the question is how thriving of a comedy scene is Austin going to be.

2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:38.640
 And the Joe can probably make it one, but as of right now it isn't.

2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:40.000
 So that would be him doing that.

2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:44.640
 But the question is a lot of people escaping Los Angeles, but I know better about New York.

2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:46.680
 There's a lot of really brilliant people.

2:11:46.680 --> 2:11:47.680
 Let them go.

2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:48.680
 There's other people.

2:11:48.680 --> 2:11:49.680
 This is the thing.

2:11:49.680 --> 2:11:50.680
 It's like, this is the fear thing.

2:11:50.680 --> 2:11:53.120
 It's like, no, but all the brilliant people are leaving.

2:11:53.120 --> 2:11:56.600
 There'll be other people and they'll fill their shoes the way that they've done throughout

2:11:56.600 --> 2:11:57.840
 history.

2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:01.200
 And I think that New York and LA, listen, maybe in five or 10 years, they're not the

2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:02.200
 two cities.

2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:08.040
 It would be real rough in five years when this pandemic's over for people in Australia

2:12:08.040 --> 2:12:12.640
 to go, dude, you got to go to America and you got to visit Charleston and Austin.

2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:13.640
 Yeah.

2:12:13.640 --> 2:12:14.640
 Stop.

2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:15.640
 Let's be adults here.

2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:16.640
 Let's be adults.

2:12:16.640 --> 2:12:18.640
 It's still going to be New York and LA for a while.

2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:27.440
 LA is an absolute hellscape, but I don't think you're going to replace California with another

2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:28.440
 place.

2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:31.680
 And also, everyone's going to make decisions now because we're literally in the midst of

2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:33.640
 a pandemic we've never had before.

2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:35.880
 We've never had this before.

2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:37.920
 Joe loved California up until the pandemic.

2:12:37.920 --> 2:12:39.240
 He had problems with it.

2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:40.720
 Like we all have problems with it.

2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:42.360
 There's a lot of benefits to being here.

2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:47.200
 I think a lot of us made pretty bad decisions in 2020 because we were all locked up and

2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:49.160
 stuck with our own thoughts.

2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:54.920
 But so it's funny there's parallels because I don't necessarily, you know, I'm obviously

2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:59.120
 a fan of comedy, but I don't care where comics move.

2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:03.560
 But there's a parallel move that's happening instead of decisions which do influence my

2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:07.800
 decision making, which is where to start a business that's tech centered.

2:13:07.800 --> 2:13:12.440
 And that's more about the San Francisco Silicon Valley.

2:13:12.440 --> 2:13:15.360
 And there is a lot of people leaving there.

2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:16.880
 And they're going to Austin.

2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:22.360
 Well, Austin, there's a, I think, there's a bunch of different places, Phoenix.

2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:23.360
 There's Denver.

2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:26.720
 Austin will probably be a massive tech hub.

2:13:26.720 --> 2:13:27.720
 Elon's there.

2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:32.040
 It seems like it's all, everything about Austin says that it's going to be a massive tech

2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:33.040
 hub.

2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:35.640
 I just don't know if that means it'll be a massive comedy hub.

2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:36.640
 It might.

2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:38.480
 I don't know if those two can actually coexist.

2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:39.480
 It's interesting.

2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:40.480
 Yeah.

2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:43.840
 I don't, I think, you know, comedy suffered in New York and LA when everyone got super

2:13:43.840 --> 2:13:44.840
 rich.

2:13:44.840 --> 2:13:47.200
 Like, you know, it just wasn't as cool.

2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:48.640
 It's still much more fun on the road.

2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:53.320
 It's still more fun to perform for people that want and need to laugh in strip malls

2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:58.520
 than it is to perform for hedge fund managers and with their dates and, you know, Instagram

2:13:58.520 --> 2:13:59.520
 models in LA.

2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:00.520
 It's just what it is.

2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:01.760
 Comedy on the road is much more fun.

2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:06.880
 So maybe in the spirit of that, Austin becomes, but, you know, you know, Austin is just colonized

2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:10.680
 by tech bros and stuff like, yeah, I mean, sure, sure, it'll be fun and it'll be great.

2:14:10.680 --> 2:14:13.840
 I think Joe's made LA a scene.

2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:16.760
 So if anyone's going to make Austin a scene, it's Joe.

2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:22.840
 Yeah, and I like the, on the Elon side, which is what I'm much more familiar with, the promise

2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:27.280
 of the possibility of what that could become because there's a lot of problems in Silicon

2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:28.280
 Valley.

2:14:28.280 --> 2:14:32.640
 And of course, it might be naive to think that just because it's like the grass is greener

2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:37.200
 thing, which is just because the place where you come from has a lot of problems.

2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:39.160
 It doesn't mean you can just create a new place.

2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:40.160
 It's not going to have those.

2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:41.160
 Yeah.

2:14:41.160 --> 2:14:42.160
 There's homelessness in Austin.

2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:43.160
 There are problems in Austin.

2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:48.520
 I think that with, by the way, with the influx of very rich people to an area, sometimes

2:14:48.520 --> 2:14:52.200
 that helps things, but sometimes it just makes things more polarizing and it's spot puts

2:14:52.200 --> 2:14:55.280
 a spotlight on those problems and makes those problems even bigger, right?

2:14:55.280 --> 2:14:59.160
 So I mean, I don't know that it's necessarily, it's hard to predict.

2:14:59.160 --> 2:15:01.160
 I just know the LA right now is funny.

2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:04.360
 It's funny that there's 15 year old tech talkers making millions of dollars dancing

2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:06.480
 in a house while the world burns.

2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:07.480
 That is very funny.

2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:10.840
 Well, it's for your, for it, for your style of humor.

2:15:10.840 --> 2:15:11.840
 Yes.

2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:12.840
 The absurdity of the world.

2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:13.840
 It is.

2:15:13.840 --> 2:15:17.720
 No one cares about Hollywood starlets and actresses and actors and everyone goes, hey, fuck you.

2:15:17.720 --> 2:15:22.120
 Even though they've won three Academy Awards, they're all being replaced by just mediocre

2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:23.960
 dancer 15 year olds.

2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:28.640
 I mean, it's like there's something hilarious about this city and it will burn in hell, but

2:15:28.640 --> 2:15:29.720
 so will everything.

2:15:29.720 --> 2:15:31.120
 So what are we talking about?

2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:32.120
 Yeah.

2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:37.840
 Eventually the sun will die out and we will all be gone unless we colonize outside of

2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:39.080
 our solar system.

2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:45.240
 But, you know, I stand, I just sit here, you know, I'm struggling with this because Boston,

2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:50.840
 I'm currently at MIT, Boston doesn't feel like the right place to start a business in

2:15:50.840 --> 2:15:52.800
 the tech sector.

2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:56.800
 And so I'm choosing, I'm looking at San Francisco the way it is, and I'm looking at Austin.

2:15:56.800 --> 2:15:58.400
 Oh, Austin up clearly.

2:15:58.400 --> 2:16:06.520
 So it seems clear, but it's such a difficult thing to, to predict what a place will look

2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:08.960
 like in 10 years and 15 years and 20 years.

2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:12.160
 And it's so hard to predict if you'll like it or not until you're there.

2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:15.200
 And you know, this is speaking to risk.

2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:18.320
 There's not really a good reason for me to move anywhere.

2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:21.400
 There's not a good reason to do anything in life.

2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:26.480
 Part of me wants to just fucking do it and whatever and see what happens.

2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:27.480
 You like Boston.

2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:31.200
 You like other things about Boston besides the tech thing.

2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:32.200
 You like MIT.

2:16:32.200 --> 2:16:33.200
 MIT, that's the problem.

2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:35.360
 And but you like, you like like the food in Boston.

2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:36.360
 Do you eat food?

2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:39.720
 I haven't been, I haven't eaten food or been outside for years.

2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:44.160
 And I mean that, that's probably the better version, but you're keto forever.

2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:46.000
 You've been keto for a long time.

2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:47.000
 Yeah.

2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:54.640
 Keto fasting for a long time, 15 years fasting, eating once or twice a day.

2:16:54.640 --> 2:16:55.640
 I haven't.

2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:57.480
 But no sugar ever.

2:16:57.480 --> 2:17:05.480
 No like, no sugar and no pasta ever, no bread ever, no pasta, no bread, no, except like,

2:17:05.480 --> 2:17:10.320
 so you could kind of live anywhere because like going out is such a big part of what

2:17:10.320 --> 2:17:13.480
 city you live in and like, you like the food there, do you like the restaurants, can you

2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:14.480
 meet people, whatever.

2:17:14.480 --> 2:17:18.800
 But it's like, you really can just kind of, yeah, so not married, no kids, right?

2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:19.800
 You have freedom.

2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:20.800
 I'm me too.

2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:21.800
 I have freedom.

2:17:21.800 --> 2:17:22.800
 Yeah.

2:17:22.800 --> 2:17:25.120
 And that's, we have the curse of too many choices.

2:17:25.120 --> 2:17:26.120
 Right.

2:17:26.120 --> 2:17:27.120
 That's the thing.

2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:28.120
 We have too many choices.

2:17:28.120 --> 2:17:30.880
 We don't have somebody else going, what about like, we don't have to justify our decisions

2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:31.880
 to anyone.

2:17:31.880 --> 2:17:32.880
 Yeah.

2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:34.640
 So we can just kind of like let our minds run wild.

2:17:34.640 --> 2:17:41.000
 So you just got to hone the instinct of just what feels right and just fucking do it and

2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:42.000
 that's it.

2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:43.000
 I think Austin would show down there and Elon down there.

2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:46.480
 Austin seems like a real no brainer move for you.

2:17:46.480 --> 2:17:47.480
 To try.

2:17:47.480 --> 2:17:48.480
 To try.

2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:49.480
 Why the hell not?

2:17:49.480 --> 2:17:50.480
 Why not?

2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:51.480
 Why not?

2:17:51.480 --> 2:17:52.480
 And then I think I should go to MIT.

2:17:52.480 --> 2:17:58.480
 Like, I mean, I mean, I think I should give those nerds a piece of my mind and you should

2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:04.160
 go to, I was in an Uber pool once with a kid from MIT and I was eating this thing from

2:18:04.160 --> 2:18:05.160
 Bova's Bakery.

2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:06.160
 I forget what it was.

2:18:06.160 --> 2:18:08.720
 It was like, it's so good.

2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:09.720
 I don't know.

2:18:09.720 --> 2:18:10.720
 You don't know Bova's Bakery, right?

2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:11.720
 Yeah.

2:18:11.720 --> 2:18:12.720
 It's a boss.

2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:13.720
 It's famous.

2:18:13.720 --> 2:18:15.120
 I was eating a thing and I was like covered in chocolate and this kid, like this little

2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:19.640
 nerd, like this little like, you know, USB drive with feet was just staring at me and

2:18:19.640 --> 2:18:22.880
 they just dropped them off at MIT and he like scurried away.

2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:27.000
 But that's a big school that doesn't the NSA recruit out of there heavy like MIT places

2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:28.000
 like that?

2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:30.720
 I can't, I can't speak to that.

2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:36.800
 But what, this is the ridiculous question I sometimes ask myself when I'm alone.

2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:37.960
 What is the meaning of life?

2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:43.360
 Do you think about the big existential kind of, why the hell we're here?

2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:46.440
 It's a cosmic kind of joke kind of in a weird way, right?

2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:52.440
 I mean, Joe said it the other day on maybe it was you saying that like, he was just like,

2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:55.440
 you know, by the time you figure out what it is, you're out of here.

2:18:55.440 --> 2:18:58.400
 You know, it's kind of interesting or you even start to figure out what it is you're

2:18:58.400 --> 2:18:59.400
 out of here.

2:18:59.400 --> 2:19:00.840
 It's like, that's kind of funny.

2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:08.240
 It's like, you don't get enough time to truly, I think the meaning of life is just like,

2:19:08.240 --> 2:19:12.160
 at the end of the day, do you feel it was time well spent?

2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:13.960
 Was it time well spent?

2:19:13.960 --> 2:19:16.600
 That's, that's really what it is.

2:19:16.600 --> 2:19:21.400
 If you look back, do you go, hey, it was time well spent, like a pretty good ride.

2:19:21.400 --> 2:19:22.400
 It was pretty good ride.

2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:29.040
 I did, I did, I did a lot, I did a lot of things I doing what you say is a part of

2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:30.600
 it, I think.

2:19:30.600 --> 2:19:34.480
 If you say you're going to do something, maybe doing it.

2:19:34.480 --> 2:19:40.160
 That seems to be extrapolating the meaning of life question to like, you know, what did

2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:41.160
 you come here to do?

2:19:41.160 --> 2:19:45.200
 I think it goes down deep of like, who are you and what do you want and, you know, what

2:19:45.200 --> 2:19:47.520
 are you suited to do and what?

2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:53.120
 It does seem that like the people who are most enlightened that I've ever met or read

2:19:53.120 --> 2:19:58.520
 books by, they ultimately land on humor, like they don't take shit seriously.

2:19:58.520 --> 2:20:03.840
 They embrace the absurdity of it all and just kind of laugh at, laugh at it in this kind

2:20:03.840 --> 2:20:04.840
 of simple way.

2:20:04.840 --> 2:20:11.400
 So this seemed like humor is like one of the fundamental truths of the scene that we're

2:20:11.400 --> 2:20:12.400
 in.

2:20:12.400 --> 2:20:13.400
 And somehow.

2:20:13.400 --> 2:20:14.400
 It's love.

2:20:14.400 --> 2:20:15.400
 It's love.

2:20:15.400 --> 2:20:16.400
 Humor.

2:20:16.400 --> 2:20:17.400
 Humor can be love, right?

2:20:17.400 --> 2:20:22.160
 People laughing that that sound is kind of like, Carolyn Knapp who wrote a book called

2:20:22.160 --> 2:20:28.160
 Drinking a Love Story, which is a really good book about not drinking.

2:20:28.160 --> 2:20:29.720
 Drinking and then not drinking.

2:20:29.720 --> 2:20:35.400
 And she said that you could understand things as love, that I think one of the last lines

2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:40.440
 in the thing is like, people talking about their experiences in life, that could be love.

2:20:40.440 --> 2:20:41.800
 Like, you know, laughter is love.

2:20:41.800 --> 2:20:46.640
 Like I feel like love and finding it wherever you could find it is why we're here.

2:20:46.640 --> 2:20:48.280
 That's that connection.

2:20:48.280 --> 2:20:55.960
 And laughter can be love and, you know, figuring out, you know, something that makes life better

2:20:55.960 --> 2:21:01.160
 for a lot of people can be love, you know, whether it's a vaccine or a technological

2:21:01.160 --> 2:21:06.440
 advancement or whatever, like, you know, all of those things I think can be that feeling.

2:21:06.440 --> 2:21:07.920
 And I think that's what's important.

2:21:07.920 --> 2:21:11.320
 It connects you to a larger frequency, you know?

2:21:11.320 --> 2:21:13.440
 I don't think there's a better way to end it, Tim.

2:21:13.440 --> 2:21:15.720
 I hope you're one of the voices.

2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:20.160
 I truly believe that your legacy would be one of the most important voices of our time because

2:21:20.160 --> 2:21:27.880
 you're fearless and challenging all the absurdity of the nonsense that of our social and political

2:21:27.880 --> 2:21:28.880
 discourse.

2:21:28.880 --> 2:21:30.160
 I hope you keep doing it.

2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:31.160
 I'm a fan.

2:21:31.160 --> 2:21:32.960
 I'm still a bit starstruck, so.

2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:33.960
 Oh, stop it.

2:21:33.960 --> 2:21:42.360
 Listen, I was your intellectual capacity, enjoying anything I do, only underscores how truly fucked

2:21:42.360 --> 2:21:43.360
 we are.

2:21:43.360 --> 2:21:46.840
 But thank you very much.
