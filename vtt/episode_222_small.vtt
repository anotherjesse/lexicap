00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
 The following is a conversation with Jay McClelland,

00:03.400 --> 00:05.400
 a cognitive scientist at Stanford

00:05.400 --> 00:07.000
 and one of the seminal figures

00:07.000 --> 00:09.560
 in the history of artificial intelligence

00:09.560 --> 00:12.320
 and specifically neural networks.

00:12.320 --> 00:15.920
 Having written the parallel distributed processing book

00:15.920 --> 00:17.560
 with David Romel Hart,

00:17.560 --> 00:21.680
 who coauthored the back propagation paper with Jeff Hinton.

00:21.680 --> 00:24.440
 In their collaborations, they've paved the way

00:24.440 --> 00:26.160
 for many of the ideas at the center

00:26.160 --> 00:29.440
 of the neural network based machine learning revolution

00:29.440 --> 00:32.040
 of the past 15 years.

 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

00:38.840 --> 00:42.320
 and here is my conversation with Jay McClelland.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.480
 You are one of the seminal figures

00:45.480 --> 00:47.400
 in the history of neural networks.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.840
 At the intersection of cognitive psychology

00:49.840 --> 00:51.720
 and computer science,

00:51.720 --> 00:54.240
 what do you has over the decades emerged

00:54.240 --> 00:57.480
 as the most beautiful aspect about neural networks,

00:57.480 --> 00:59.520
 both artificial and biological?

01:00.920 --> 01:03.800
 The fundamental thing I think about with neural networks

01:03.800 --> 01:08.800
 is how they allow us to link biology

01:10.120 --> 01:13.600
 with the mysteries of thought.

01:13.600 --> 01:18.600
 And when I was first entering the field,

01:19.280 --> 01:23.040
 myself in the late 60s, early 70s,

01:23.040 --> 01:28.040
 cognitive psychology had just become a field.

01:29.560 --> 01:33.400
 There was a book published in 67 called Cognitive Psychology.

01:36.080 --> 01:41.080
 And the author said that the study of the nervous system

01:42.040 --> 01:44.520
 was only of peripheral interest.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.120
 It wasn't gonna tell us anything about the mind.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.920
 And I didn't agree with that.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.920
 I always felt, oh, look, I'm a physical being.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.320
 From dust to dust, ashes to ashes,

02:02.320 --> 02:04.840
 and somehow I emerged from that.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.960
 So that's really interesting.

02:07.960 --> 02:11.680
 So there was a sense with cognitive psychology

02:11.680 --> 02:16.560
 that in understanding the sort of neuronal structure

02:16.560 --> 02:20.000
 of things, you're not going to be able to understand the mind.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.680
 And then your sense is if we study these neural networks,

02:23.680 --> 02:25.880
 we might be able to get at least very close

02:25.880 --> 02:28.200
 to understanding the fundamentals of the human mind.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.280
 Yeah.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.560
 I used to think, or I used to talk about the idea

02:32.560 --> 02:35.240
 of awakening from the Cartesian dream.

02:36.600 --> 02:41.600
 So Descartes thought about these things, right?

02:41.680 --> 02:46.240
 He was walking in the gardens of Versailles one day

02:46.240 --> 02:48.000
 and he stepped on a stone.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
 And a statue moved, and he walked a little further.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.880
 He stepped on another stone and another statue moved.

02:55.880 --> 02:59.280
 And he like, why did the statue move

02:59.280 --> 03:00.520
 when I stepped on the stone?

03:00.520 --> 03:02.840
 And he went and talked to the gardeners

03:02.840 --> 03:05.800
 and he found out that they had a hydraulic system

03:06.760 --> 03:10.600
 that allowed the physical contact with the stone

03:10.600 --> 03:12.760
 to cause water to flow in various directions,

03:12.760 --> 03:14.760
 which caused water to flow into the statue

03:14.760 --> 03:15.840
 and move the statue.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.840
 And he used this as the beginnings of a theory

03:22.840 --> 03:26.480
 about how animals act.

03:28.280 --> 03:33.280
 And he had this notion that these little fibers

03:33.360 --> 03:36.440
 that people had identified that weren't carrying the blood,

03:37.440 --> 03:39.920
 you know, were these little hydraulic tubes

03:39.920 --> 03:42.160
 that if you touch something that would be pressure

03:42.160 --> 03:43.720
 and it would send a signal of pressure

03:43.720 --> 03:47.960
 to the other parts of the system and that would cause action.

03:49.200 --> 03:54.200
 So he had a mechanistic theory of animal behavior.

03:54.240 --> 03:59.040
 And he thought that the human had this animal body,

04:00.080 --> 04:05.080
 but that some divine something else had to have come down

04:05.080 --> 04:09.080
 and been placed in him to give him the ability to think.

04:09.080 --> 04:14.080
 Right, so the physical world includes the body in action,

04:14.400 --> 04:18.080
 but it doesn't include thought according to Descartes, right?

04:18.080 --> 04:21.560
 And so the study of physiology at that time

04:21.560 --> 04:25.040
 was the study of sensory systems and motor systems

04:25.040 --> 04:28.800
 and things that you could directly measure

04:28.800 --> 04:31.920
 when you stimulated neurons and stuff like that.

04:31.920 --> 04:36.920
 And the study of cognition was something that, you know,

04:36.920 --> 04:40.640
 was tied in with abstract computer algorithms

04:40.640 --> 04:41.880
 and things like that.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.600
 But when I was an undergraduate,

04:44.600 --> 04:48.240
 I learned about the physiological mechanisms.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.800
 And so when I'm studying cognitive psychology

04:50.800 --> 04:53.320
 as a first year PhD student, I'm saying,

04:53.320 --> 04:55.840
 wait a minute, the whole thing is biological.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.200
 You had that intuition right away.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.480
 That seemed obvious to you.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.560
 Yeah, yeah.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.000
 Isn't that magical though,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.760
 that from just the little bit of biology can emerge

05:07.760 --> 05:10.440
 the full beauty of the human experience?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.760
 Why is that so obvious to you?

05:12.760 --> 05:16.760
 Well, obvious and not obvious at the same time.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.000
 And I think about Darwin in this context too,

05:20.000 --> 05:24.600
 because Darwin knew very early on

05:24.600 --> 05:28.840
 that none of the ideas that anybody had ever offered

05:28.840 --> 05:30.840
 gave him a sense of understanding

05:30.840 --> 05:34.160
 how evolution could have worked.

05:36.040 --> 05:40.120
 But he wanted to figure out how it could have worked.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.120
 That was his goal.

05:42.120 --> 05:47.120
 And he spent a lot of time working on this idea

05:48.080 --> 05:50.880
 and coming, you know, reading about things

05:50.880 --> 05:53.120
 that gave him hints and thinking they were interesting,

05:53.120 --> 05:56.360
 but not knowing why and drawing more and more pictures

05:56.360 --> 05:58.680
 of different birds that differ slightly from each other

05:58.680 --> 05:59.600
 and so on, you know.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.520
 And then he figured it out.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.960
 But after he figured it out, he had nightmares about it.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.000
 He would dream about the complexity of the eye

06:10.000 --> 06:12.720
 and the arguments that people had given

06:12.720 --> 06:16.200
 about how ridiculous it was to imagine

06:16.200 --> 06:20.480
 that that could have ever emerged from some sort of,

06:20.480 --> 06:24.680
 you know, unguided process,

06:24.680 --> 06:29.840
 that it hadn't been the product of design.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.000
 So he didn't publish for a long time,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.440
 in part because he was scared of his own ideas.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.360
 He didn't think they could probably possibly be true.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.360
 Yeah.

06:40.960 --> 06:45.680
 But then, you know, by the time the 20th century

06:45.680 --> 06:49.840
 rolls around, we all, you know,

06:49.840 --> 06:54.440
 we understand that many people understand

06:54.440 --> 06:57.960
 or believe that evolution produced, you know,

06:57.960 --> 07:02.120
 the entire range of animals that there are.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.040
 And, you know, Descartes's idea starts

07:06.040 --> 07:08.240
 to seem a little wonky after a while, right?

07:08.240 --> 07:09.480
 Like, well, wait a minute.

07:11.240 --> 07:15.400
 There's the apes and the chimpanzees and the bonobos

07:15.400 --> 07:18.400
 and, you know, like, they're pretty smart in some ways,

07:18.400 --> 07:19.360
 you know, so what?

07:20.600 --> 07:22.040
 Oh, you know, somebody comes up,

07:22.040 --> 07:23.720
 oh, there's a certain part of the brain

07:23.720 --> 07:24.560
 that's still different.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.720
 They don't, you know, there's no hippocampus

07:26.720 --> 07:28.760
 in the monkey brain.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.160
 It's only in the human brain.

07:31.160 --> 07:34.280
 Huxley had to do a surgery in front of many, many people

07:34.280 --> 07:36.280
 in the late 19th century to show to them

07:36.280 --> 07:40.360
 there's actually a hippocampus in the chimpanzees brain,

07:40.360 --> 07:42.000
 you know?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.840
 So their continuity of the species

07:45.840 --> 07:49.680
 is another element that, you know,

07:49.680 --> 07:54.400
 contributes to this sort of, you know,

07:55.680 --> 08:00.680
 idea that we are ourselves a total product of nature.

08:01.920 --> 08:06.920
 And that, to me, is the magic and the mystery how.

08:06.960 --> 08:11.880
 How nature could actually, you know,

08:11.880 --> 08:16.880
 give rise to organisms that have the capabilities

08:16.880 --> 08:18.440
 that we have.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.440
 So it's interesting because even the idea of evolution

08:21.440 --> 08:25.440
 is hard for me to keep all together in my mind.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.440
 So because we think of a human timescale,

08:28.440 --> 08:30.800
 it's hard to imagine that, like,

08:30.800 --> 08:34.480
 the development of the human eye will give me nightmares, too.

08:34.480 --> 08:38.120
 Because you have to think across many, many, many generations.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.880
 And it's very tempting to think about, kind of,

08:40.880 --> 08:43.040
 a growth of a complicated object.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.880
 And it's like, how is it possible for that to happen?

08:45.880 --> 08:50.080
 Is it possible for that such a thing to be built?

08:50.080 --> 08:53.240
 Because also, me, from a robotics engineering perspective,

08:53.240 --> 08:55.320
 it's very hard to build these systems.

08:55.320 --> 08:58.600
 How can, through an undirected process,

08:58.600 --> 09:00.960
 can a complex thing be designed?

09:00.960 --> 09:03.440
 It seems not, it seems wrong.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.640
 Yeah, so that's absolutely right.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.680
 And, you know, a slightly different career path

09:08.680 --> 09:10.600
 that would have been equally interesting to me

09:10.600 --> 09:15.880
 would have been to actually study the process

09:15.880 --> 09:21.400
 of embryological development flowing on

09:21.400 --> 09:28.800
 into brain development and the exquisite, sort of,

09:28.800 --> 09:32.320
 laying down of pathways and so on that occurs in the brain.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.720
 And I know the slightest bit about that is not my field,

09:35.720 --> 09:43.800
 but there are, you know, fascinating aspects

09:43.800 --> 09:47.600
 to this process that eventually result

09:47.600 --> 09:53.960
 in the, you know, the complexity of various brains.

09:53.960 --> 10:00.600
 At least, you know, one thing we're in the field,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.480
 I think people have felt for a long time.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.920
 And in the study of vision, the continuity

10:05.920 --> 10:08.480
 between humans and nonhuman animals

10:08.480 --> 10:12.520
 has been second nature for a lot longer.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.360
 I was having, I had this conversation

10:15.360 --> 10:17.480
 with somebody who's a vision scientist,

10:17.480 --> 10:19.880
 and you're saying, oh, we don't have any problem with this.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.440
 You know, the monkey's visual system

10:21.440 --> 10:26.280
 and the human visual system, extremely similar,

10:26.280 --> 10:29.720
 up to certain levels, of course, they diverge after a while.

10:29.720 --> 10:35.560
 But the first, the visual pathway from the eye to the brain

10:35.560 --> 10:43.360
 and the first few layers of cortex or cortical areas,

10:43.360 --> 10:49.200
 I guess, one would say, are extremely similar.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.600
 Yeah, so on the cognition side is where the leap seems

10:52.600 --> 10:55.040
 to happen with humans, that it does seem

10:55.040 --> 10:56.680
 to work kind of special.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.520
 And that's a really interesting question

10:58.520 --> 11:00.320
 when thinking about alien life,

11:00.320 --> 11:03.120
 or if there's other intelligent alien civilizations

11:03.120 --> 11:06.040
 out there, is how special is this leap?

11:06.040 --> 11:09.320
 So one special thing seems to be the origin of life itself.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.880
 However you define that, there's a gray area.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.840
 And the other leap, this is very biased perspective

11:14.840 --> 11:19.760
 of a human, is the origin of intelligence.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.080
 And again, from an engineer perspective,

11:22.080 --> 11:24.440
 it's a difficult question to ask.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.000
 An important one is how difficult does that leap?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.080
 How special were humans?

11:30.080 --> 11:32.360
 Did a monolith come down?

11:32.360 --> 11:33.720
 Did aliens bring down a monolith?

11:33.720 --> 11:38.120
 And some apes had to touch a monolith to get it?

11:38.120 --> 11:41.640
 It's a lot like Descartes's idea, right?

11:41.640 --> 11:46.640
 Exactly, but it just seems one heck of a leap

11:46.640 --> 11:48.520
 to get to this level of intelligence.

11:48.520 --> 12:00.640
 Yeah, and so Chomsky argued that some genetic fluke occurred

12:00.640 --> 12:02.320
 100,000 years ago.

12:02.320 --> 12:07.120
 And just happened that some human,

12:07.120 --> 12:13.040
 some hominin predecessor of current humans

12:13.040 --> 12:20.360
 had this one genetic tweak that resulted in language.

12:20.360 --> 12:28.440
 And language then provided this special thing that

12:28.440 --> 12:30.920
 separates us from all other animals.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.440
 I think there's a lot of truth to the value and importance

12:39.440 --> 12:43.440
 of language, but I think it comes along

12:43.440 --> 12:49.000
 with the evolution of a lot of other related things related

12:49.000 --> 12:54.120
 to sociality and mutual engagement with others

12:54.120 --> 13:01.480
 and establishment of, I don't know,

13:01.480 --> 13:07.080
 rich mechanisms for organizing and understanding

13:07.080 --> 13:12.960
 of the world, which language then plugs into.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.600
 Right, so language is a tool that

13:16.600 --> 13:19.040
 allows you to do this kind of collective intelligence.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.560
 And whatever is at the core of the thing

13:21.560 --> 13:23.800
 that allows for this collective intelligence

13:23.800 --> 13:25.320
 is the main thing.

13:25.320 --> 13:29.240
 And it's interesting to think about that one fluke,

13:29.240 --> 13:34.840
 one mutation could lead to the first crack opening

13:34.840 --> 13:37.880
 of the door to human intelligence.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.200
 Like all it takes is one.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.520
 Like evolution just kind of opens the door a little bit

13:41.520 --> 13:45.880
 and then time and selection takes care of the rest.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.160
 You know, there's so many fascinating aspects

13:48.160 --> 13:49.120
 to these kinds of things.

13:49.120 --> 13:54.160
 So we think of evolution as continuous, right?

13:54.160 --> 13:58.680
 We think, oh, yes, OK, over 500 million years,

13:58.680 --> 14:04.840
 there could have been this relatively continuous changes.

14:04.840 --> 14:13.120
 And but that's not what anthropologists, evolutionary

14:13.120 --> 14:15.600
 biologists found from the fossil record.

14:15.600 --> 14:24.440
 They found hundreds of millions of years of stasis.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.040
 And then suddenly a change occurs.

14:27.040 --> 14:31.600
 Well, suddenly on that scale is a million years or something.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.920
 But or even 10 million years.

14:33.920 --> 14:38.880
 But the concept of punctuated equilibrium

14:38.880 --> 14:44.160
 was a very important concept in evolutionary biology

14:44.160 --> 14:53.840
 and that also feels somehow right about the stages

14:53.840 --> 14:55.200
 of our mental abilities.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.200
 We seem to have a certain kind of mindset at a certain age.

14:59.200 --> 15:04.240
 And then at another age, we look at that four year old

15:04.240 --> 15:07.200
 and say, oh, my god, how could they have thought that way?

15:07.200 --> 15:10.120
 So Piaget was known for this kind of stage theory

15:10.120 --> 15:11.560
 of child development, right?

15:11.560 --> 15:14.760
 And you look at it closely and suddenly those stages

15:14.760 --> 15:17.160
 are so discreet and transitions.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.360
 But the difference between the four year old and the seven

15:19.360 --> 15:20.840
 year old is profound.

15:20.840 --> 15:24.280
 And that's another thing that's always interested me

15:24.280 --> 15:28.200
 is how we, something happens over the course

15:28.200 --> 15:31.280
 of several years of experience where at some point we

15:31.280 --> 15:34.920
 reach the point where something like an insight

15:34.920 --> 15:38.240
 or a transition or a new stage of development occurs.

15:38.240 --> 15:45.240
 And these kinds of things can be understood

15:45.240 --> 15:47.600
 in complex systems research.

15:47.600 --> 15:55.840
 And so evolutionary biology, developmental biology,

15:55.840 --> 15:57.760
 cognitive development are all things

15:57.760 --> 16:00.000
 that have been approached in this kind of way.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.160
 Yeah.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.920
 Just like you said, I find both fascinating

16:03.920 --> 16:07.160
 those early years of human life, but also

16:07.160 --> 16:13.120
 the early minutes, days of the embryonic development

16:13.120 --> 16:17.440
 to how from embryos you get the brain.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.840
 That development, again, from an engineer perspective

16:20.840 --> 16:22.000
 is fascinating.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.360
 So the early, when you deploy the brain to the human world

16:27.360 --> 16:29.320
 and it gets to explore that world and learn,

16:29.320 --> 16:30.440
 that's fascinating.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.320
 But just like the assembly of the mechanism

16:33.320 --> 16:36.640
 that is capable of learning, that's amazing.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.600
 The stuff they're doing with brain organoids

16:39.600 --> 16:42.600
 where you can build many brains and study

16:42.600 --> 16:48.240
 that self assembly of a mechanism from the DNA material,

16:48.240 --> 16:51.720
 that's like, what the heck?

16:51.720 --> 16:55.240
 You have literally biological programs

16:55.240 --> 17:00.520
 that just generate a system, this mushy thing that's

17:00.520 --> 17:05.600
 able to be robust and learn in a very unpredictable world

17:05.600 --> 17:08.280
 and learn seemingly arbitrary things.

17:08.280 --> 17:11.960
 Or a very large number of things

17:11.960 --> 17:14.080
 that enable survival.

17:14.080 --> 17:15.040
 Yeah.

17:15.040 --> 17:19.880
 Ultimately, that is a very important part

17:19.880 --> 17:22.280
 of the whole process of understanding

17:22.280 --> 17:27.720
 this sort of emergence of mind from brain kind of thing.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.760
 And the whole thing seems to be pretty continuous.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.520
 So let me step back to neural networks

17:32.520 --> 17:35.160
 for another brief minute.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.880
 You wrote parallel distributed processing books

17:37.880 --> 17:42.080
 that explored ideas of neural networks in the 1980s

17:42.080 --> 17:43.160
 together with a few folks.

17:43.160 --> 17:47.160
 But the books you wrote with David Romelhardt,

17:47.160 --> 17:50.840
 who is the first author on the back propagation paper,

17:50.840 --> 17:52.400
 which you have Hinton.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
 So these are just some figures at the time

17:54.400 --> 17:57.000
 that we're thinking about these big ideas.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.320
 What are some memorable moments of discovery

18:00.320 --> 18:04.560
 and beautiful ideas from those early days?

18:04.560 --> 18:12.000
 I'm going to start sort of with my own process in the mid

18:12.000 --> 18:18.840
 70s and then into the late 70s when I met Jeff Hinton

18:18.840 --> 18:21.640
 and he came to San Diego.

18:21.640 --> 18:28.960
 And we were all together in my time in graduate schools.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.280
 I've already described to you.

18:30.280 --> 18:33.360
 I had this sort of feeling of, OK,

18:33.360 --> 18:35.640
 I'm really interested in human cognition.

18:35.640 --> 18:40.160
 But this disembodied sort of way of thinking about it

18:40.160 --> 18:44.560
 that I'm getting from the current mode of thought about it

18:44.560 --> 18:47.200
 isn't working fully for me.

18:47.200 --> 18:53.680
 And when I got my assistant professorship, I went to UCSD

18:53.680 --> 18:58.560
 and that was in 1974.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.920
 Something amazing had just happened.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.600
 Dave Rommelhardt had written a book together

19:03.600 --> 19:06.240
 with another man named Don Norman.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.960
 And the book was called Explorations in Cognition.

19:09.960 --> 19:14.800
 And it was a series of chapters exploring

19:14.800 --> 19:17.800
 interesting questions about cognition,

19:17.800 --> 19:22.880
 but in a completely sort of abstract, nonbiological kind

19:22.880 --> 19:23.400
 of way.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.440
 And I'm saying, gee, this is amazing.

19:25.440 --> 19:29.000
 I'm coming to this community where people can get together

19:29.000 --> 19:35.120
 and feel like they've collectively exploring ideas.

19:35.120 --> 19:39.880
 And it was a book that had a lot of, I don't know,

19:39.880 --> 19:41.000
 lightness to it.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.240
 And Don Norman, who was the more senior figure

19:47.240 --> 19:51.240
 to Rommelhardt at that time, who led that project,

19:51.240 --> 19:55.880
 always created this spirit of playful exploration of ideas.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.320
 And so I'm like, wow, this is great.

19:58.320 --> 20:07.560
 But I was also still trying to get from the neurons

20:07.560 --> 20:10.440
 to the cognition.

20:10.440 --> 20:15.720
 And I realized at one point, I got this opportunity

20:15.720 --> 20:18.760
 to go to a conference where I heard a talk by a man named

20:18.760 --> 20:22.560
 James Anderson, who was an engineer,

20:22.560 --> 20:26.000
 but by then a professor in a psychology department

20:26.000 --> 20:33.240
 who had used linear algebra to create neural network models

20:33.240 --> 20:37.520
 of perception and categorization and memory.

20:37.520 --> 20:41.160
 And I just blew me out of the water

20:41.160 --> 20:47.920
 that one could create a model that was simulating neurons,

20:47.920 --> 20:56.720
 not just kind of engaged in a stepwise algorithmic process

20:56.720 --> 20:58.560
 that was construed abstractly.

20:58.560 --> 21:03.560
 But it was simulating remembering and recalling

21:03.560 --> 21:07.960
 and recognizing the prior occurrence of a stimulus

21:07.960 --> 21:08.960
 or something like that.

21:08.960 --> 21:13.480
 So for me, this was a bridge between the mind and the brain.

21:13.480 --> 21:20.480
 And I remember I was walking cross campus one day in 1977.

21:20.480 --> 21:25.000
 And I almost felt like St. Paul on the road to Damascus.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.040
 I said to myself, you know, if I think about the mind,

21:30.040 --> 21:32.760
 in terms of a neural network, it will help me answer.

21:32.760 --> 21:36.040
 The question is about the mind that I'm trying to answer.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.760
 And that really excited me.

21:38.760 --> 21:45.040
 So I think that a lot of people were becoming excited about that.

21:45.040 --> 21:50.000
 And one of those people was Jim Anderson, who I had mentioned.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.120
 Another one was Steve Grossberg, who

21:52.120 --> 21:58.720
 had been writing about neural networks since the 60s.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.720
 And Jeff Hinton was yet another.

22:00.720 --> 22:08.760
 And his PhD dissertation showed up in an applicant pool

22:08.760 --> 22:11.720
 to a postdoctoral training program

22:11.720 --> 22:16.200
 that Dave and Don, the two men I mentioned before,

22:16.200 --> 22:19.320
 Rommelhardt and Norman, were administering.

22:19.320 --> 22:23.200
 And Rommelhardt got really excited about Hinton's PhD

22:23.200 --> 22:26.160
 dissertation.

22:26.160 --> 22:31.600
 And so Hinton was one of the first people who came and joined

22:31.600 --> 22:35.520
 this group of postdoctoral scholars that

22:35.520 --> 22:39.360
 was funded by this wonderful grant that they got.

22:39.360 --> 22:44.080
 Another one who is also well known in neural network circles

22:44.080 --> 22:45.680
 is Paul Smolensky.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.960
 He was another one of that group.

22:47.960 --> 22:55.960
 Anyway, Jeff and Jim Anderson organized a conference

22:55.960 --> 22:59.520
 at UCSD where we were.

22:59.520 --> 23:04.560
 And it was called Parallel Models of Associative Memory.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.360
 And it brought all the people together

23:06.360 --> 23:11.800
 who had been thinking about these kinds of ideas in 1979 or 1980.

23:11.800 --> 23:18.800
 And this began to kind of really resonate

23:18.800 --> 23:23.200
 with some of Rommelhardt's own thinking,

23:23.200 --> 23:27.800
 some of his reasons for wanting something other than the kinds

23:27.800 --> 23:30.080
 of computation he'd been doing so far.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.000
 So let me talk about Rommelhardt now for a minute,

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
 OK, with that context.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.600
 Well, let me also just pause because you

23:34.600 --> 23:37.640
 said so many interesting things before we go to Rommelhardt.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.960
 So first of all, for people who are not familiar,

23:40.960 --> 23:43.120
 neural networks are at the core of the machine learning,

23:43.120 --> 23:45.280
 deep learning revolution of today.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.560
 Jeffrey Hinton that we mentioned is one of the figures

23:48.560 --> 23:50.400
 that were important in the history,

23:50.400 --> 23:53.080
 like yourself, in the development of these neural networks

23:53.080 --> 23:54.880
 or artificial neural networks that are then

23:54.880 --> 23:56.960
 used for the machine learning application.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.320
 Like I mentioned, the back propagation paper

23:59.320 --> 24:02.840
 is one of the optimization mechanisms by which

24:02.840 --> 24:05.840
 these networks can learn.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.520
 And the word parallel is really interesting.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.960
 So it's almost like synonymous from a computational

24:12.960 --> 24:15.280
 perspective with how you thought at the time

24:15.280 --> 24:19.360
 about neural networks as parallel computation.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.040
 Would that be fair to say?

24:21.040 --> 24:25.600
 Well, yeah, the word parallel in this

24:25.600 --> 24:30.160
 comes from the idea that each neuron is

24:30.160 --> 24:33.520
 an independent computational unit, right?

24:33.520 --> 24:36.400
 It gathers data from other neurons.

24:36.400 --> 24:39.320
 It integrates it in a certain way,

24:39.320 --> 24:40.920
 and then it produces a result.

24:40.920 --> 24:44.880
 And it's a very simple little computational unit.

24:44.880 --> 24:50.920
 But it's autonomous in the sense that it does its thing,

24:50.920 --> 24:53.160
 right, it's in a biological medium

24:53.160 --> 24:57.320
 where it's getting nutrients and various chemicals

24:57.320 --> 25:00.320
 from that medium.

25:00.320 --> 25:05.840
 But you can think of it as almost like a little computer

25:05.840 --> 25:07.960
 in and of itself.

25:07.960 --> 25:13.240
 So the idea is that each, our brains have, oh, look,

25:13.240 --> 25:19.280
 100 or hundreds, almost a billion of these little neurons,

25:19.280 --> 25:24.400
 right, and they're all capable of doing their work

25:24.400 --> 25:25.600
 at the same time.

25:25.600 --> 25:29.920
 So it's like, instead of just a single central processor

25:29.920 --> 25:36.720
 that's engaged in chug one step after another,

25:36.720 --> 25:41.120
 we have a billion of these little computational units

25:41.120 --> 25:42.560
 working at the same time.

25:42.560 --> 25:45.880
 So at the time that's, I don't know, maybe you can comment,

25:45.880 --> 25:50.680
 it seems to me, even still to me, quite a revolutionary way

25:50.680 --> 25:53.640
 to think about computation relative

25:53.640 --> 25:56.680
 to the development of theoretical computer science

25:56.680 --> 25:58.840
 alongside of that, where it's very much

25:58.840 --> 26:00.480
 like sequential computer.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.280
 You're analyzing algorithms that are

26:02.280 --> 26:04.400
 running on a single computer.

26:04.400 --> 26:08.320
 You're saying, wait a minute, why don't we

26:08.320 --> 26:11.400
 take a really dumb, very simple computer

26:11.400 --> 26:14.440
 and just have a lot of them interconnected together?

26:14.440 --> 26:16.600
 And they're all operating in their own little world

26:16.600 --> 26:18.600
 and they're communicating with each other

26:18.600 --> 26:21.000
 and thinking of computation in that way.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.560
 And from that kind of computation,

26:24.560 --> 26:28.600
 trying to understand how things like certain characteristics

26:28.600 --> 26:31.400
 of the human mind can emerge, that's

26:31.400 --> 26:36.040
 quite a revolutionary way of thinking, I would say.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.560
 Well, yes, I agree with you.

26:37.560 --> 26:48.000
 And there's still this sort of sense of not

26:48.000 --> 26:54.400
 sort of knowing how we kind of get all the way there, I think.

26:54.400 --> 26:58.720
 And this very much remains at the core of the questions

26:58.720 --> 27:01.880
 that everybody's asking about the capabilities of deep learning

27:01.880 --> 27:03.000
 and all these kinds of things.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.040
 But if I could just play this out a little bit,

27:08.040 --> 27:13.600
 a convolutional neural network or a CNN, which many people

27:13.600 --> 27:19.840
 may have heard of, is a set of, you

27:19.840 --> 27:25.680
 could think of it biologically as a set of collections

27:25.680 --> 27:28.080
 of neurons.

27:28.080 --> 27:33.680
 Each collection has maybe 10,000 neurons in it.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.760
 But there's many layers, right?

27:35.760 --> 27:39.040
 Some of these things are hundreds or even 1,000 layers

27:39.040 --> 27:43.680
 deep, but others are closer to the biological brain

27:43.680 --> 27:45.920
 and maybe they're like 20 layers deep or something

27:45.920 --> 27:47.040
 like that.

27:47.040 --> 27:52.960
 So within each layer, we have thousands of neurons

27:52.960 --> 27:54.440
 or tens of thousands, maybe.

27:54.440 --> 27:59.480
 Well, in the brain, we probably have millions in each layer,

27:59.480 --> 28:02.640
 but we're getting sort of similar in a certain way, right?

28:06.000 --> 28:09.280
 And then we think, OK, at the bottom level,

28:09.280 --> 28:12.120
 there's an array of things that are like the photoreceptors.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.520
 In the eye, they respond to the amount of light

28:15.520 --> 28:20.000
 of a certain wavelength at a certain location on the pixel

28:20.000 --> 28:21.200
 array.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.640
 So that's like the biological eye,

28:24.640 --> 28:27.320
 and then there's several further stages going up,

28:27.320 --> 28:30.600
 layers of these neuron like units.

28:30.600 --> 28:36.720
 And you go from that raw input, array of pixels,

28:36.720 --> 28:40.840
 to a classification, you've actually

28:40.840 --> 28:44.160
 built a system that could do the same kind of thing

28:44.160 --> 28:46.760
 that you and I do when we open our eyes and we look around

28:46.760 --> 28:49.760
 and we see there's a cup, there's a cell phone,

28:49.760 --> 28:52.200
 there's a water bottle.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.960
 And these systems are doing that now, right?

28:54.960 --> 29:00.400
 So they are, in terms of the parallel idea

29:00.400 --> 29:02.240
 that we were talking about before,

29:02.240 --> 29:05.560
 they are doing this massively parallel computation

29:05.560 --> 29:09.880
 in the sense that each of the neurons in each of those layers

29:09.880 --> 29:16.080
 is thought of as computing its little bit of something

29:16.080 --> 29:19.680
 about the input simultaneously with all the other ones

29:19.680 --> 29:21.960
 in the same layer.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.080
 We get to the point of abstracting that away

29:24.080 --> 29:27.120
 and thinking, oh, it's just one whole vector that's

29:27.120 --> 29:30.440
 being computed, one activation pattern that's

29:30.440 --> 29:32.000
 computed in a single step.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.280
 And that abstraction is useful, but it's still

29:37.280 --> 29:41.320
 that parallel and distributed processing, right?

29:41.320 --> 29:43.800
 Each one of these guys is just contributing a tiny bit

29:43.800 --> 29:45.080
 to that whole thing.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.720
 And that's the excitement that you felt

29:46.720 --> 29:49.800
 that from these simple things, you

29:49.800 --> 29:53.880
 can emerge when you add these level of abstractions on it.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.040
 You can start getting all the beautiful things

29:56.040 --> 29:58.200
 that we think about as cognition.

29:58.200 --> 30:01.160
 And so, OK, so you have this conference.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.560
 I forgot the name already, but it's

30:02.560 --> 30:04.440
 parallel and something associative of memory

30:04.440 --> 30:08.640
 and so on, very exciting, technical and exciting title.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.720
 And you started talking about Dave Romerhardt.

30:11.720 --> 30:15.120
 So who is this person that was so,

30:15.120 --> 30:17.240
 you've spoken very highly of him.

30:17.240 --> 30:21.720
 Can you tell me about him, his ideas, his mind,

30:21.720 --> 30:24.920
 who he was as a human being, as a scientist?

30:24.920 --> 30:31.720
 So Dave came from a little tiny town in Western South Dakota.

30:31.720 --> 30:35.840
 And his mother was the librarian,

30:35.840 --> 30:38.360
 and his father was the editor of the newspaper.

30:38.360 --> 30:43.360
 And I know one of his brothers pretty well.

30:43.360 --> 30:48.360
 They grew up, there were four brothers,

30:48.360 --> 30:54.360
 and they grew up together, and their father

30:54.360 --> 30:57.360
 encouraged them to compete with each other a lot.

30:57.360 --> 31:02.360
 They competed in sports, and they competed in mind games.

31:02.360 --> 31:06.360
 I don't know, things like Sudoku and chess

31:06.360 --> 31:08.360
 and various things like that.

31:08.360 --> 31:16.360
 And Dave was a standout undergraduate.

31:16.360 --> 31:21.360
 He went at a younger age than most people do to college

31:21.360 --> 31:24.360
 at the University of South Dakota and majored in mathematics.

31:24.360 --> 31:29.360
 And I don't know how he got interested in psychology,

31:29.360 --> 31:34.360
 but he applied to the mathematical psychology program

31:34.360 --> 31:37.360
 at Stanford and was accepted as a PhD student

31:37.360 --> 31:40.360
 to study mathematical psychology at Stanford.

31:40.360 --> 31:46.360
 So mathematical psychology is the use of mathematics

31:46.360 --> 31:50.360
 to model mental processes.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.360
 So something that I think these days

31:52.360 --> 31:55.360
 might be called cognitive modeling, that whole space?

31:55.360 --> 32:02.360
 Yeah, it's mathematical in the sense that you say

32:02.360 --> 32:05.360
 if this is true and that is true,

32:05.360 --> 32:08.360
 then I can derive that this should follow.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.360
 And so you say, these are my stipulations

32:10.360 --> 32:12.360
 about the fundamental principles,

32:12.360 --> 32:15.360
 and this is my prediction about behavior,

32:15.360 --> 32:17.360
 and it's all done with equations.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.360
 It's not done with a computer simulation.

32:20.360 --> 32:23.360
 You solve the equation and that tells you

32:23.360 --> 32:27.360
 what the probability that the subject will be correct

32:27.360 --> 32:29.360
 on the seventh trial of the experiment is

32:29.360 --> 32:31.360
 or something like that.

32:31.360 --> 32:37.360
 It's a use of mathematics to descriptively characterize

32:37.360 --> 32:40.360
 aspects of behavior.

32:40.360 --> 32:43.360
 And Stanford at that time was the place

32:43.360 --> 32:48.360
 where there were several really, really strong

32:48.360 --> 32:51.360
 mathematical thinkers who were also connected

32:51.360 --> 32:53.360
 with three or four others around the country

32:53.360 --> 32:59.360
 who brought a lot of really exciting ideas onto the table.

32:59.360 --> 33:03.360
 And it was a very, very prestigious part

33:03.360 --> 33:05.360
 of the field of psychology at that time.

33:05.360 --> 33:08.360
 So Rommelhardt comes into this.

33:08.360 --> 33:13.360
 He was a very strong student within that program.

33:13.360 --> 33:19.360
 And he got this job at this brand new university

33:19.360 --> 33:24.360
 in San Diego in 1967 where he's one of the first

33:24.360 --> 33:30.360
 assistant professors in the Department of Psychology at UCSD.

33:30.360 --> 33:37.360
 So I got there in 74, seven years later,

33:37.360 --> 33:44.360
 and Rommelhardt at that time was still doing

33:44.360 --> 33:48.360
 mathematical modeling.

33:48.360 --> 33:53.360
 But he had gotten interested in cognition.

33:53.360 --> 33:59.360
 He had gotten interested in understanding.

33:59.360 --> 34:04.360
 And understanding, I think, remains.

34:04.360 --> 34:08.360
 What does it mean to understand anyway?

34:08.360 --> 34:11.360
 It's an interesting sort of curious,

34:11.360 --> 34:15.360
 like how would we know if we really understood something?

34:15.360 --> 34:19.360
 But he was interested in building machines

34:19.360 --> 34:22.360
 that would hear a couple of sentences

34:22.360 --> 34:24.360
 right about what was going on.

34:24.360 --> 34:30.360
 So for example, one of his favorite things at that time was

34:30.360 --> 34:34.360
 Margie was sitting on the front step when she heard

34:34.360 --> 34:38.360
 the familiar jingle of the good humor man.

34:38.360 --> 34:42.360
 She remembered her birthday money and ran into the house.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.360
 What is Margie doing?

34:44.360 --> 34:47.360
 Why?

34:47.360 --> 34:50.360
 Well, there's a couple of ideas you could have,

34:50.360 --> 34:54.360
 but the most natural one is that the good humor man

34:54.360 --> 34:55.360
 brings ice cream.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.360
 She likes ice cream.

34:57.360 --> 35:00.360
 She knows she needs money to buy ice cream,

35:00.360 --> 35:02.360
 so she's going to run into the house and get her money

35:02.360 --> 35:04.360
 so she can buy herself an ice cream.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.360
 It's a huge amount of inference that has to happen

35:06.360 --> 35:09.360
 to get those things to link up with each other.

35:09.360 --> 35:13.360
 And he was interested in how the hell that could happen.

35:13.360 --> 35:21.360
 And he was trying to build good old fashioned A.I. style models

35:21.360 --> 35:32.360
 of representation of language and content of things like has money.

35:32.360 --> 35:35.360
 So like a lot of like formal logic and like knowledge bases,

35:35.360 --> 35:36.360
 like that kind of stuff.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.360
 Yeah.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.360
 So he was integrating that with his thinking about cognition.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.360
 Yes.

35:41.360 --> 35:45.360
 With his cognition, how can they mechanistically be applied

35:45.360 --> 35:49.360
 to build these knowledge, like to actually build something

35:49.360 --> 35:52.360
 that looks like a web of knowledge,

35:52.360 --> 35:56.360
 and thereby from there emerges something like understanding.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.360
 Yeah.

35:57.360 --> 35:58.360
 What the heck that is.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.360
 Yeah.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.360
 He was grappling.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.360
 This was something that they grappled with at the end of that book

36:03.360 --> 36:06.360
 that I was describing, Explorations in Cognition.

36:06.360 --> 36:11.360
 But he was realizing that the paradigm of good old fashioned A.I.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.360
 wasn't giving him the answers to these questions.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.360
 Yeah.

36:15.360 --> 36:18.360
 And by the way, that's called good old fashioned A.I. now.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.360
 It was called that at the time.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.360
 Well, it was.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.360
 It was beginning to be called that.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.360
 Because it was from the 60s.

36:24.360 --> 36:25.360
 Yeah.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.360
 Yeah.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.360
 By the late 70s, it was kind of old fashioned.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.360
 It hadn't really panned out, you know.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.360
 And people were beginning to recognize that.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.360
 And Rommelhardt was, you know, like, yeah,

36:36.360 --> 36:39.360
 he was part of the recognition that this wasn't all working.

36:39.360 --> 36:50.360
 Anyway, so he started thinking in terms of the idea that we needed systems

36:50.360 --> 36:55.360
 that allowed us to integrate multiple simultaneous constraints

36:55.360 --> 36:59.360
 in a way that would be mutually influencing each other.

36:59.360 --> 37:07.360
 So he wrote a paper that just really, first time I read it, I said,

37:07.360 --> 37:11.360
 oh, well, you know, yeah, but is this important?

37:11.360 --> 37:14.360
 But after a while, it just got under my skin.

37:14.360 --> 37:18.360
 And it was called an interactive model of reading.

37:18.360 --> 37:30.360
 And in this paper, he laid out the idea that every aspect of our interpretation

37:30.360 --> 37:41.360
 of what's coming off the page when we read at every level of analysis you can think of

37:41.360 --> 37:45.360
 actually depends on all the other levels of analysis.

37:45.360 --> 37:54.360
 So what are the actual pixels making up each letter?

37:54.360 --> 38:00.360
 And what do those pixels signify about which letters they are?

38:00.360 --> 38:05.360
 And what are those letters tell us about what words are there?

38:05.360 --> 38:12.360
 And what are those words tell us about what ideas the author is trying to convey

38:12.360 --> 38:24.360
 and so he had this model where we have these little tiny elements

38:24.360 --> 38:29.360
 that represent each of the pixels of each of the letters

38:29.360 --> 38:32.360
 and then other ones that represent the line segments in them

38:32.360 --> 38:36.360
 and other ones that represent the letters and other ones that represent the words.

38:36.360 --> 38:42.360
 And at that time, his idea was there's this set of experts.

38:42.360 --> 38:48.360
 There's an expert about how to construct a line out of pixels

38:48.360 --> 38:53.360
 and another expert about how which sets of lines go together to make which letters

38:53.360 --> 38:56.360
 and another one about which letters go together to make bench words

38:56.360 --> 38:59.360
 and another one about what the meanings of the words are

38:59.360 --> 39:04.360
 and another one about how the meanings fit together and things like that.

39:04.360 --> 39:12.360
 All these experts are looking at this data and they're updating hypotheses at other levels.

39:12.360 --> 39:15.360
 So the word expert can tell the letter expert,

39:15.360 --> 39:20.360
 oh, I think there should be a T there because I think there should be a word the here

39:20.360 --> 39:23.360
 and the bottom up sort of feature to letter expert could say,

39:23.360 --> 39:28.360
 I think there should be a T there too and if they agree, then you see a T, right?

39:28.360 --> 39:32.360
 And so there's a top down bottom up interactive process

39:32.360 --> 39:34.360
 but it's going on at all layers simultaneously.

39:34.360 --> 39:38.360
 So everything can filter all the way down from the top as well as all the way up from the bottom

39:38.360 --> 39:44.360
 and it's a completely interactive, bidirectional, parallel distributed process.

39:44.360 --> 39:48.360
 That is somehow because of the abstractions is hierarchical.

39:48.360 --> 39:54.360
 So there's different layers of responsibilities, different levels of responsibilities.

39:54.360 --> 39:58.360
 First of all, it's fascinating to think about it in this kind of mechanistic way.

39:58.360 --> 40:04.360
 So not thinking purely from the structure of a neural network or something like a neural network

40:04.360 --> 40:11.360
 but thinking about these little guys that work on letters and then the letters come words and words become sentences

40:11.360 --> 40:21.360
 and that's a very interesting hypothesis that from that kind of hierarchical structure can emerge understanding.

40:21.360 --> 40:28.360
 But the thing is though, I want to just sort of relate this to earlier part of the conversation.

40:28.360 --> 40:34.360
 When Ronald Hart was first thinking about it, there were these experts on the side,

40:34.360 --> 40:39.360
 one for the features and one for the letters and one for how the letters make the words and so on

40:39.360 --> 40:46.360
 and they would each be working sort of evaluating various propositions about, you know,

40:46.360 --> 40:52.360
 is this combination of features here going to be one that looks like the letter T and so on?

40:52.360 --> 40:59.360
 And what he realized kind of after reading Hinton's dissertation

40:59.360 --> 41:06.360
 and hearing about Jim Anderson's linear algebra based neural network models

41:06.360 --> 41:12.360
 that I was telling you about before was that he could replace those experts with neuron like processing units

41:12.360 --> 41:16.360
 which just would have their connection weights that would do this job.

41:16.360 --> 41:22.360
 So what ended up happening was that Ronald Hart and I got together

41:22.360 --> 41:28.360
 and we created a model called the Interactive Activation Model of Letter Perception

41:28.360 --> 41:41.360
 which takes these little pixel level inputs, constructs line segment features, letters and words

41:41.360 --> 41:45.360
 but now we built it out of a set of neuron like processing units

41:45.360 --> 41:49.360
 that are just connected to each other with connection weights.

41:49.360 --> 41:55.360
 So the unit for the word time has a connection to the unit for the letter T in the first position

41:55.360 --> 41:59.360
 and the letter I in the second position, so on.

41:59.360 --> 42:05.360
 And because these connections are bidirectional,

42:05.360 --> 42:09.360
 if you have prior knowledge that it might be the word time that starts to prime

42:09.360 --> 42:14.360
 the letters and the features and if you don't then it has to start bottom up

42:14.360 --> 42:19.360
 but the directionality just depends on where the information comes in first

42:19.360 --> 42:23.360
 and if you have context together with features at the same time

42:23.360 --> 42:27.360
 they can convergently result in an emergent perception

42:27.360 --> 42:35.360
 and that was the piece of work that we did together

42:35.360 --> 42:44.360
 that sort of got us both completely convinced that this neural network way of thinking

42:44.360 --> 42:50.360
 was going to be able to actually address the questions that we were interested in as cognitive cycles.

42:50.360 --> 42:54.360
 So the algorithmic side, the optimization side, those are all details.

42:54.360 --> 42:59.360
 When you first start the idea that you can get far with this kind of way of thinking,

42:59.360 --> 43:01.360
 that in itself is a profound idea.

43:01.360 --> 43:07.360
 So do you like the term connectionism to describe this kind of set of ideas?

43:07.360 --> 43:09.360
 I think it's useful.

43:09.360 --> 43:17.360
 It highlights the notion that the knowledge that the system exploits

43:17.360 --> 43:21.360
 is in the connections between the units.

43:21.360 --> 43:27.360
 There isn't a separate dictionary, there's just the connections between the units.

43:27.360 --> 43:32.360
 So I already sort of laid that on the table with the connections

43:32.360 --> 43:36.360
 from the letter units to the unit for the word time.

43:36.360 --> 43:39.360
 The unit for the word time isn't a unit for the word time

43:39.360 --> 43:45.360
 for any other reason than it's got the connections to the letters that make up the word time.

43:45.360 --> 43:49.360
 Those are the units on the input that excite it when it's excited

43:49.360 --> 43:57.360
 that it in a sense represents in the system that there's support for the hypothesis

43:57.360 --> 44:01.360
 that the word time is present in the input.

44:01.360 --> 44:08.360
 But it's not, the word time isn't written anywhere inside the model.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.360
 It's only written there in the picture we drew of the model

44:11.360 --> 44:14.360
 to say that's the unit for the word time.

44:14.360 --> 44:20.360
 And if somebody wants to tell me, well, how do you spell that word?

44:20.360 --> 44:27.360
 You have to use the connections from that out to then get those letters, for example.

44:27.360 --> 44:31.360
 That's such a counterintuitive idea.

44:31.360 --> 44:35.360
 Where humans want to think in this logic way.

44:35.360 --> 44:41.360
 This idea of connectionism, it's weird.

44:41.360 --> 44:43.360
 It's weird that this is how it all works.

44:43.360 --> 44:44.360
 Yeah.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.360
 But let's go back to that CNN, right?

44:46.360 --> 44:51.360
 That CNN with all those layers of neuron like processing units that we were talking about before.

44:51.360 --> 44:55.360
 It's going to come out and say, this is a cat, that's a dog.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.360
 But it has no idea why it said that.

44:57.360 --> 45:02.360
 It's just got all these connections between all these layers of neurons.

45:02.360 --> 45:07.360
 From the very first layer to the, whatever these layers are,

45:07.360 --> 45:13.360
 they just get numbered after a while because they somehow further in you go,

45:13.360 --> 45:21.360
 the more abstract the features are, but it's a graded and continuous sort of process of abstraction anyway.

45:21.360 --> 45:28.360
 And it goes from very local, very specific to much more sort of global,

45:28.360 --> 45:33.360
 but it's still another sort of pattern of activation over an array of units.

45:33.360 --> 45:37.360
 And then at the output side, it says it's cat or it's a dog.

45:37.360 --> 45:47.360
 And when I open my eyes and say, oh, that's Lex or, oh, there's my own dog.

45:47.360 --> 45:52.360
 And I recognize my dog, which is a member of the same species as many other dogs.

45:52.360 --> 45:57.360
 But I know this one because of some slightly unique characteristics.

45:57.360 --> 46:02.360
 I don't know how to describe what it is that makes me know that I'm looking at Lex

46:02.360 --> 46:04.360
 or at my particular dog.

46:04.360 --> 46:07.360
 Or even that I'm looking at a particular brand of car.

46:07.360 --> 46:12.360
 I can say a few words about it, but I wrote you a paragraph about the car.

46:12.360 --> 46:16.360
 You would have trouble figuring out which car is he talking about.

46:16.360 --> 46:21.360
 So the idea that we have propositional knowledge of what it is

46:21.360 --> 46:28.360
 that allows us to recognize that this is an actual instance of this particular natural kind

46:28.360 --> 46:36.360
 has always been something that it never worked.

46:36.360 --> 46:41.360
 You couldn't ever write down a set of propositions for visual recognition.

46:41.360 --> 46:46.360
 And so in that space, it's sort of always seemed very natural

46:46.360 --> 46:56.360
 that something more implicit, you don't have access to what the details of the computation were in between.

46:56.360 --> 46:58.360
 You just get the result.

46:58.360 --> 47:01.360
 So that's the other part of connectionism.

47:01.360 --> 47:04.360
 You don't read the contents of the connections.

47:04.360 --> 47:09.360
 The connections only cause outputs to occur based on inputs.

47:09.360 --> 47:16.360
 For us, that final layer or some particular layer is very important.

47:16.360 --> 47:22.360
 The one that tells us that it's our dog or it's a cat or a dog.

47:22.360 --> 47:28.360
 But each layer is probably equally as important in the grand scheme of things.

47:28.360 --> 47:33.360
 There's no reason why the cat versus dog is more important than the lower level activations.

47:33.360 --> 47:34.360
 It doesn't really matter.

47:34.360 --> 47:38.360
 I mean, all of it is just this beautiful stacking on top of each other.

47:38.360 --> 47:40.360
 And we humans live in this particular layer.

47:40.360 --> 47:49.360
 For us, it's useful to survive, to use those cat versus dog, predator versus prey, all those kinds of things.

47:49.360 --> 47:52.360
 It's fascinating that it's all contained.

47:52.360 --> 47:55.360
 But then you then ask the history of artificial intelligence.

47:55.360 --> 48:05.360
 You ask, are we able to introspect and convert the very things that allow us to tell the difference to cat and dog into logic, into formal logic.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.360
 That's been the dream.

48:06.360 --> 48:10.360
 I would say that's still part of the dream of symbolic AI.

48:10.360 --> 48:19.360
 And I've recently talked to Doug Lennett, who created Psych.

48:19.360 --> 48:28.360
 And that's a project that lasted for many decades and still carries a sort of dream in it.

48:28.360 --> 48:30.360
 We still don't know the answer.

48:30.360 --> 48:34.360
 It seems like connectionism is really powerful.

48:34.360 --> 48:38.360
 But it also seems like there's this building of knowledge.

48:38.360 --> 48:41.360
 And so how do we, how do you square those two?

48:41.360 --> 48:52.360
 Like, do you think the connections can contain the depth of human knowledge and the depth of what Dave Rommelhardt was thinking about of understanding?

48:52.360 --> 48:55.360
 Well, that remains the $64 question.

48:55.360 --> 48:57.360
 And I...

48:57.360 --> 48:59.360
 With inflation that number is higher.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.360
 Okay, $64 is the housing dollar.

49:01.360 --> 49:07.360
 Maybe it's a $64 billion question now.

49:07.360 --> 49:23.360
 You know, I think that from the emergent side, which, you know, I placed myself on.

49:23.360 --> 49:29.360
 So I used to sometimes tell people I was a radical, eliminative connectionist.

49:29.360 --> 49:39.360
 Because I didn't want them to think that I wanted to build like anything into the machine.

49:39.360 --> 49:55.360
 But I don't like the word eliminative anymore because it makes it seem like it's wrong to think that there is this emergent level of understanding.

49:55.360 --> 49:59.360
 And I disagree with that.

49:59.360 --> 50:09.360
 So I think, you know, I would call myself an a radical emergentist connectionist rather than a eliminative connectionist, right?

50:09.360 --> 50:20.360
 Because I want to acknowledge that these higher level kinds of aspects of our cognition are real.

50:20.360 --> 50:28.360
 But they don't exist as such.

50:28.360 --> 50:36.360
 And there was an example that Doug Hofstetter used to use that I thought was helpful in this respect.

50:36.360 --> 50:51.360
 Just the idea that we could think about sand dunes as entities and talk about like how many there are even.

50:51.360 --> 50:56.360
 But we also know that a sand dune is a very fluid thing.

50:56.360 --> 51:10.360
 It's a pile of sand that is capable of moving around under the wind and, you know, reforming itself in somewhat different ways.

51:10.360 --> 51:22.360
 And if we think about our thoughts as like sand dunes as being things that, you know, emerge from just the way all the lower level elements sort of work together

51:22.360 --> 51:29.360
 and are constrained by external forces, then we can say, yes, they exist as such.

51:29.360 --> 51:47.360
 But they also, you know, we shouldn't treat them as completely monolithic entities that we can understand without understanding sort of all of the stuff that allows them to change in the ways that they do.

51:47.360 --> 51:52.360
 And that's where I think the connectionist feeds into the cognitive.

51:52.360 --> 52:08.360
 It's like, okay, so if the substrate is parallel distributed connectionist, then it doesn't mean that the contents of thought isn't, you know, like abstract and symbolic.

52:08.360 --> 52:15.360
 But it's more fluid, maybe, than it's easier to capture with a set of logical expressions.

52:15.360 --> 52:23.360
 Yeah, that's a heck of a sort of thing to put at the top of a resume, radical emergentist connectionist.

52:23.360 --> 52:34.360
 So there is, just like you said, a beautiful dance between that, between the machinery of intelligence, like the neural network side of it, and the stuff that emerges.

52:34.360 --> 52:50.360
 I mean, the stuff that emerges seems to be, I don't know, I don't know what that is, that it seems like maybe all of reality is emergent.

52:50.360 --> 53:10.360
 But what I think about, this is made most distinctly rich to me when I look at cellular phenomena, look at game of life, that from very, very simple things, very rich, complex things emerge that start looking very quickly like organisms,

53:10.360 --> 53:21.360
 that you forget how the actual thing operates, they start looking like they're moving around, they're eating each other, some of them are generating offspring, you forget very quickly.

53:21.360 --> 53:32.360
 And it seems like maybe it's something about the human mind that wants to operate in some layer of the emergent and forget about the mechanism of how that emergent happens.

53:32.360 --> 53:48.360
 But just like you are in your radicalness, also it seems like unfair to eliminate the magic of that emergent, like eliminate the fact that that emergent is real.

53:48.360 --> 54:02.360
 Yeah, no, I agree. That's why I got rid of eliminative, because it seemed like that was trying to say that it's all completely like...

54:02.360 --> 54:04.360
 An illusion of some kind, that's not...

54:04.360 --> 54:26.360
 Who knows whether there aren't some illusory characteristics there. And I think that philosophically, many people have confronted that possibility over time, but it's still important to accept it as magic.

54:26.360 --> 54:44.360
 So I think of Fellini and this context, I think of others who have appreciated the role of magic, of actual trickery in creating illusions that move us.

54:44.360 --> 54:58.360
 And Plato was onto this too, it's like somehow or other these shadows give rise to something much deeper than that.

54:58.360 --> 55:06.360
 So we won't try to figure out what it is, we'll just accept it as given that that occurs.

55:06.360 --> 55:08.360
 But he was still onto the magic of it.

55:08.360 --> 55:16.360
 Yeah, we won't try to really, really deep understand how it works, we'll just enjoy the fact that it's kind of fun.

55:16.360 --> 55:28.360
 Okay, but you worked closely with Dave over on my heart, he passed away as a human being, what do you remember about him? Do you miss the guy?

55:28.360 --> 55:38.360
 Absolutely. He passed away 15ish years ago now.

55:38.360 --> 55:59.360
 And his demise was actually one of the most poignant and relevant tragedies relevant to our conversation.

55:59.360 --> 56:14.360
 He started to undergo a progressive neurological condition that isn't fully understood.

56:14.360 --> 56:33.360
 That is to say his particular course isn't fully understood because brain scans weren't done at certain stages and no autopsy was done or anything like that, the wishes of the family.

56:33.360 --> 56:59.360
 So we don't know as much about the underlying pathology as we might, but I had begun to get interested in this neurological condition that might have been the very one that he was succumbing to as my own efforts to understand another aspect of this mystery that we've been discussing.

56:59.360 --> 57:04.360
 While he was beginning to get progressively more and more affected.

57:04.360 --> 57:09.360
 So I'm going to talk about the disorder and not about Rommelhardt for a second, okay?

57:09.360 --> 57:17.360
 The disorder is something my colleagues and collaborators have chosen to call semantic dementia.

57:17.360 --> 57:44.360
 So it's a specific form of loss of mind related to meaning, semantic dementia, and it's progressive in the sense that the patient loses the ability to appreciate the meaning of the experiences that they have.

57:44.360 --> 57:56.360
 Either from touch, from sight, from sound, from language, they, I hear sounds, but I don't know what they mean kind of thing.

57:56.360 --> 58:21.360
 So as this illness progresses, it starts with the patient being unable to differentiate like similar breeds of dog or remember the lower frequency unfamiliar categories that they used to be able to remember.

58:21.360 --> 58:46.360
 But as it progresses, it becomes more and more striking and the patient loses the ability to recognize things like pigs and goats and sheep and calls all middle sized animals dogs and all can't recognize rabbits and rodents anymore.

58:46.360 --> 58:53.360
 They call all the little ones cats and they can't recognize hippopotamuses and cows anymore.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.360
 They call them all horses, you know.

58:55.360 --> 59:07.360
 So there was this one patient who went through this progression where at a certain point, any four legged animal, he would call it either a horse or a dog or a cat.

59:07.360 --> 59:10.360
 And if it was big, he would tend to call it a horse.

59:10.360 --> 59:16.360
 If it was small, he'd tend to call it a cat, middle sized ones he called dogs.

59:16.360 --> 59:19.360
 This is just a part of the syndrome though.

59:19.360 --> 59:25.360
 The patient loses the ability to relate concepts to each other.

59:25.360 --> 59:34.360
 So my collaborator in this work, Carolyn Patterson, developed a test called the pyramids and palm trees test.

59:34.360 --> 59:40.360
 So you give the patient a picture of pyramids and they have a choice.

59:40.360 --> 59:42.360
 Which goes with the pyramids?

59:42.360 --> 59:45.360
 Palm trees or pine trees?

59:45.360 --> 59:59.360
 And, you know, she showed that this wasn't just a matter of language because the patient's loss of disability shows up whether you present the material with words or with pictures.

59:59.360 --> 1:00:05.360
 The pictures, they can't put the pictures together with each other properly anymore.

1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:07.360
 They can't relate the pictures to the words either.

1:00:07.360 --> 1:00:15.360
 They can't do word picture matching, but they've lost the conceptual grounding from either modality of input.

1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:19.360
 And so that's why it's called semantic dementia.

1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:22.360
 The very semantics is disintegrating.

1:00:22.360 --> 1:00:33.360
 And we understand this in terms of our idea that distributed representation, a pattern of activation represents the concepts, really similar ones.

1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:38.360
 As you degrade them, they start being, you lose the differences.

1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:44.360
 And then, so the difference between the dog and the goat sort of is no longer part of the pattern anymore.

1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:49.360
 And since dog is really familiar, that's the thing that remains.

1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:52.360
 And we understand that in the way the models work and learn.

1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:57.360
 But Rommelhardt underwent this condition.

1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:02.360
 So on the one hand, it's a fascinating aspect of parallel distributed processing to be.

1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:11.360
 And it reveals this sort of texture of distributed representation in a very nice way, I've always felt.

1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:18.360
 But at the same time, it was extremely poignant because this is exactly the condition that Rommelhardt was undergoing.

1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:43.360
 And there was a period of time when he was this man who had been the most focused, goal directed, competitive, thoughtful person who was willing to work for years to solve a hard problem.

1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:48.360
 He starts to disappear.

1:01:48.360 --> 1:02:04.360
 And there was a period of time when it was like hard for any of us to really appreciate that he was sort of, in some sense, not fully there anymore.

1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:14.360
 Do you know if he was able to introspect the solution of the understanding mind?

1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:19.360
 I mean, this is one of the big scientists that thinks about this.

1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:24.360
 Was he able to look at himself and understand the fading mind?

1:02:24.360 --> 1:02:40.360
 You know, we can contrast Hawking and Rommelhardt in this way, and I like to do that to honor Rommelhardt because I think Rommelhardt is sort of like the Hawking of cognitive science to me in some ways.

1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:46.360
 Both of them suffered from a degenerative condition.

1:02:46.360 --> 1:03:05.360
 In Hawking's case, it affected the motor system. In Rommelhardt's case, it's affecting the semantics and not just the pure object semantics, but maybe the self semantics as well.

1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:07.360
 And we don't understand that.

1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:09.360
 Concepts broadly.

1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:18.360
 So I would say he didn't, and this was part of what from the outside was a profound tragedy.

1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:33.360
 But on the other hand, at a some level, he sort of did because, you know, there was a period of time when he finally was realized that he had really become profoundly impaired.

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:40.360
 It's clearly a biological condition, and he wasn't, you know, it wasn't just like he was distracted that day or something like that.

1:03:40.360 --> 1:04:01.360
 So he retired, you know, from his professorship at Stanford, and he became, he lived with his brother for a couple of years, and then he moved into a facility for people with cognitive impairments.

1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:06.360
 One that, you know, many elderly people end up in when they have cognitive impairments.

1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:12.360
 And I would spend time with him during that period.

1:04:12.360 --> 1:04:16.360
 This was like in the late 90s, around 2000 even.

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:25.360
 And, you know, I would, we would go bowling, and he could still bowl.

1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:34.360
 And after bowling, I took him to lunch, and I said, where would you like to go?

1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:35.360
 You want to go to Wendy's?

1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:36.360
 And he said, nah.

1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:38.360
 And I said, okay, well, where do you want to go?

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:40.360
 And he just pointed.

1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:41.360
 He said, turn here, you know.

1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:47.360
 And so he still had a certain amount of spatial cognition, and he could get me to the restaurant.

1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:55.360
 And then when we got to the restaurant, I said, what do you want to order?

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:59.360
 And he couldn't come up with any of the words, but he knew where on the menu the thing was that he wanted.

1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:07.360
 So, you know, and he couldn't say what it was, but he knew that that's what he wanted to eat.

1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:17.360
 And so, you know, it's like it isn't monolithic at all.

1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:23.360
 Our cognition is, you know, first of all, graded in certain kinds of ways, but also multipartite.

1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:36.360
 There's many elements to it, and things, certain sort of partial competencies still exist in the absence of other aspects of these competencies.

1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:49.360
 So, this is what always fascinated me about what used to be called cognitive neuropsychology, you know, the effects of brain damage on cognition.

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:53.360
 But in particular, this gradual disintegration part.

1:05:53.360 --> 1:06:03.360
 You know, I'm a big believer that the loss of a human being that you value is as powerful as, you know, first falling in love with that human being.

1:06:03.360 --> 1:06:06.360
 I think it's all a celebration of the human being.

1:06:06.360 --> 1:06:10.360
 So, the disintegration itself too is a celebration in a way.

1:06:10.360 --> 1:06:12.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:06:12.360 --> 1:06:22.360
 And, but just to say something more about the scientist and the back propagation idea that you mentioned.

1:06:22.360 --> 1:06:34.360
 So, in 1982, Hinton had been there as a postdoc and organized that conference.

1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:41.360
 He'd actually gone away and gotten an assistant professorship, and then there was this opportunity to bring him back.

1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:47.360
 So, Jeff Hinton was back on a sabbatical in San Diego.

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:52.360
 And Rommelhardt and I had decided we wanted to do this.

1:06:52.360 --> 1:07:01.360
 You know, we thought it was really exciting and are the papers on the interactive activation model that I was telling you about had just been published.

1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:07.360
 And we both sort of saw huge potential for this work and Jeff was there.

1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:18.360
 And so, the three of us started a research group, which we called the PDP Research Group, and several other people came.

1:07:18.360 --> 1:07:24.360
 Francis Crick, who was at the Salk Institute, heard about it from Jeff.

1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:31.360
 And because Jeff was known among Brits to be brilliant and Francis was well connected with his British friends.

1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:33.360
 So, Francis Crick came.

1:07:33.360 --> 1:07:35.360
 It's a heck of a group of people.

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:40.360
 And Paul Spolensky was one of the other postdocs.

1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:45.360
 He was still there as a postdoc and a few other people.

1:07:45.360 --> 1:08:06.360
 But anyway, Jeff talked to us about learning and how we should think about how, you know, learning occurs in a neural network.

1:08:06.360 --> 1:08:26.360
 And he said, the problem with the way you guys have been approaching this is that you've been looking for inspiration from biology to tell you what the rules should be for how the synapses should change the strengths of their connections, how the connections should form.

1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:30.360
 He said, that's the wrong way to go about it.

1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:44.360
 What you should do is you should think in terms of how you can adjust connection weights to solve a problem.

1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:54.360
 So, you define your problem and then you figure out how the adjustment of the connection weights will solve the problem.

1:08:54.360 --> 1:09:04.360
 And Rommelhardt heard that and said to himself, okay, so I'm going to start thinking about it that way.

1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:14.360
 I'm going to essentially imagine that I have some objective function, some goal of the computation.

1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:27.360
 I want my machine to correctly classify all of these images and I can score that I can measure how well they're doing on each image and I get some measure of error or loss.

1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:41.360
 It's typically called in deep learning and I'm going to figure out how to adjust the connection weights so as to minimize my loss or reduce the error.

1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:53.360
 And that's called gradient descent and engineers were already familiar with the concept of gradient descent.

1:09:53.360 --> 1:10:08.360
 And in fact, there was an algorithm called the Delta Rule that had been invented by a professor in the engineering, the electrical engineering department at Stanford.

1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:13.360
 So, Bernie Widrow and a collaborator named Hoff, I don't never met him.

1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:30.360
 Anyway, so gradient descent in continuous neural networks with multiple neuron like processing units was already understood for a single layer of connection weights.

1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:33.360
 We have some inputs over a set of neurons.

1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:41.360
 In the output to produce a certain pattern, we can define the difference between our target and what the neural network is producing.

1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:45.360
 And we can figure out how to change the connection weights to reduce that error.

1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:59.360
 So what Meromohard did was to generalize that so as to be able to change the connections from earlier layers of units to the ones at a hidden layer between the input and the output.

1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:08.360
 And so he first called the algorithm the generalized Delta Rule because it's just an extension of the gradient descent idea.

1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:15.360
 And interestingly enough, Hinton was thinking that this wasn't going to work very well.

1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:25.360
 So Hinton had his own alternative algorithm at the time based on the concept of the Bolsa machine that he was pursuing.

1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:31.360
 The paper on the Bolsa machine came out in, learning in, Bolsa machines came out in 1985.

1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:38.360
 But it turned out that back prop worked better than the Bolsa machine learning algorithm.

1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:45.360
 So this generalized Delta algorithm ended up being called back propagation, as you say, back prop.

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:55.360
 And probably that name is opaque to me, but what does that mean?

1:11:55.360 --> 1:12:03.360
 What it meant was that in order to figure out what the changes you needed to make to the connections from the input to the hidden layer,

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:20.360
 you had to back propagate the error signals from the output layer through the connections from the hidden layer to the output to get the signals that would be the error signals for the hidden layer.

1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:22.360
 And that's how Rommelhardt formulated it.

1:12:22.360 --> 1:12:25.360
 It was like, well, we know what the error signals are at the output layer.

1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:32.360
 Let's see if we can get a signal at the hidden layer that tells each hidden unit what its error signal is essentially.

1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:43.360
 So it's back propagating through the connections from the hidden to the output to get the signals to tell the hidden units how to change their weights from the input.

1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:47.360
 And that's why it's called back prop.

1:12:47.360 --> 1:13:04.360
 Yeah, but so it came from Hinton having introduced the concept of define your objective function, figure out how to take the derivative so that you can adjust the connection so that they make progress towards your goal.

1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:12.360
 So stop thinking about biology for a second and let's start to think about optimization and computation a little bit more.

1:13:12.360 --> 1:13:24.360
 So what about Jeff Hinton, what you've gotten a chance to work with him in that little, the set of people involved there is quite incredible.

1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:32.360
 The small set of people under the PDP flag, it's just given the amount of impact those ideas have had over the years.

1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:34.360
 It's kind of incredible to think about.

1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:52.360
 But, you know, just like you said, like yourself, Jeffrey Hinton is seen as one of the, not just like a seminal figure in AI, but just a brilliant person, just like the horsepower of the mind is pretty high up there for him because he's just a great thinker.

1:13:52.360 --> 1:14:09.360
 So what kind of ideas have you learned from him? Have you influenced each other on? Have you debated over what stands out to you in the full space of ideas here at the intersection of computation and cognition?

1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:18.360
 Well, so Jeff has said many things to me that had a profound impact on my thinking.

1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:27.360
 And he's written several articles which were way ahead of their time.

1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:38.360
 He had two papers in 1981 just to give one example.

1:14:38.360 --> 1:15:02.360
 One of which was essentially the idea of Transformers and another of which was a early paper on semantic cognition which inspired him and Rommelhardt and me throughout the 80s.

1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:17.360
 And, you know, still I think sort of grounds my own thinking about the semantic aspects of cognition.

1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:40.360
 He also, in a small paper that was never published that he wrote in 1977, you know, before he actually arrived at UCSD or maybe a couple years even before that, I don't know, when he was a PhD student, he described how a neural network could do recursive computation.

1:15:40.360 --> 1:16:04.360
 And it was a very clever idea that he's continued to explore over time, which was sort of the idea that when you call a subroutine, you need to save the state that you had when you called it so you can get back to where you were when you're finished with the subroutine.

1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:14.360
 And the idea was that you would save the state of the calling routine by making fast changes to connection weights.

1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:33.360
 And then when you finished with the subroutine call, those fast changes in the connection weights would allow you to go back to where you had been before and reinstate the previous context so that you could continue on with the top level of the computation.

1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:35.360
 Anyway, that was part of the idea.

1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:52.360
 And I always thought, okay, that's really, you know, he just, he had extremely creative ideas that were quite a lot ahead of his time and many of them in the 1970s and early 1980s.

1:16:52.360 --> 1:17:13.360
 So another thing about Jeff Hinton's way of thinking, which has profoundly influenced my effort to understand human mathematical cognition, is that he doesn't write too many equations.

1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:22.360
 And people tell stories like, oh, in the Hinton lab meetings, you don't get up at the board and write equations like you do in everybody else's machine learning lab.

1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:24.360
 What you do is you draw a picture.

1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:48.360
 And, you know, he explains aspects of the way deep learning works by putting his hands together and showing you the shape of a ravine and using that as a geometrical metaphor for what's happening as this gradient descent process.

1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:54.360
 You're coming down the wall of a ravine, if you take too big a jump, you're going to jump to the other side.

1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:59.360
 And so that's why we have to turn down the learning rate, for example.

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:28.360
 And it speaks to me of the fundamentally intuitive character of deep insight, together with a commitment to really understanding in a way that's absolutely ultimately explicit and clear.

1:18:28.360 --> 1:18:31.360
 But also intuitive.

1:18:31.360 --> 1:18:33.360
 Yeah, there's certain people like that.

1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:40.360
 He's an example, some kind of weird mix of visual and intuitive and all those kinds of things.

1:18:40.360 --> 1:18:44.360
 Feynman is another example, different style of thinking, but very unique.

1:18:44.360 --> 1:18:53.360
 And when you're around those people, for me in the engineering realm, there's a guy named Jim Keller, who's a chip designer engineer.

1:18:53.360 --> 1:18:58.360
 Every time I talk to him, it doesn't matter what we're talking about.

1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:05.360
 Just having experienced that unique way of thinking transforms you and makes your work much better.

1:19:05.360 --> 1:19:07.360
 And that's the magic.

1:19:07.360 --> 1:19:12.360
 You look at Daniel Kahneman, you look at the great collaborations throughout the history of science.

1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:14.360
 That's the magic of that.

1:19:14.360 --> 1:19:22.360
 It's not always the exact ideas that you talk about, but it's the process of generating those ideas, being around that, spending time with that human being.

1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:30.360
 You can come up with some brilliant work, especially when it's cross disciplinary as it was a little bit in your case with Jeff.

1:19:30.360 --> 1:19:32.360
 Yeah.

1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:38.360
 Jeff is a descendant of the Logician Bull.

1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:43.360
 He comes from a long line of English academics.

1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:57.360
 And together with the deeply intuitive thinking ability that he has, he also has, it's been clear.

1:19:57.360 --> 1:20:06.360
 He's described this to me, and I think he's mentioned it from time to time in other interviews that he's had with people.

1:20:06.360 --> 1:20:22.360
 He's wanted to be able to think of himself as contributing to the understanding of reasoning itself, not just human reasoning.

1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:25.360
 Bull is about logic.

1:20:25.360 --> 1:20:31.360
 It's about what can we conclude from what else and how do we formalize that?

1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:48.360
 And as a computer scientist, logician, philosopher, you know, the goal is to understand how we derive truths from other, from givens and things like this.

1:20:48.360 --> 1:21:12.360
 And the work that Jeff was doing in the early to mid 80s on something called the Bolton machine was his way of connecting with that Boolean tradition and bringing it into the more continuous probabilistic graded constraint satisfaction realm.

1:21:12.360 --> 1:21:27.360
 And it was beautiful, a set of ideas linked with theoretical physics as well as with logic.

1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:50.360
 And it's always been, I mean, I've always been inspired by the Bolton machine too. It's like, well, if the neurons are probabilistic rather than, you know, deterministic in their computations, then, you know, that maybe this somehow is part of the serendipity or, you know,

1:21:50.360 --> 1:22:01.360
 adventitiousness of the moment of insight, right? It might not have occurred at that particular instant. It might be sort of partially the result of a stochastic process.

1:22:01.360 --> 1:22:08.360
 And that too is part of the magic of the emergence of some of these things.

1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:23.360
 You're right with the Boolean lineage and the dream of computer science is somehow, I mean, I certainly think of humans this way, that humans are one particular manifestation of intelligence, that there's something bigger going on.

1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:31.360
 And you're trying to, you're hoping to figure that out. The mechanisms of intelligence, the mechanisms of cognition are much bigger than just humans.

1:22:31.360 --> 1:23:00.360
 So I think of, I started using the phrase computational intelligence at some point as to characterize the field that I thought, you know, people like Jeff Hinton and many of the people I know at DeepMind are working in and where I feel like I'm, you know,

1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:10.360
 I'm a kind of a human oriented computational intelligence researcher in that I'm actually kind of interested in the human solution.

1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:38.360
 But at the same time, I feel like that's where a huge amount of the excitement of deep learning actually lies is in the idea that, you know, we may be able to even go beyond what we can achieve with our own nervous systems when we build computational intelligence

1:23:38.360 --> 1:23:46.360
 as that are, you know, not limited in the ways that we are by our own biology.

1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:55.360
 Perhaps allowing us to scale the very mechanisms of human intelligence just increases power through scale.

1:23:55.360 --> 1:24:11.360
 Yes. And I think that that, you know, obviously that's the, that's being played out massively at Google Brain, at OpenAI and to some extent at DeepMind as well.

1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:27.360
 I guess I shouldn't say to some extent, but just the massive scale of the computations that are used to succeed at games like Go or to solve the protein folding problems that they've been solving and so on.

1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:32.360
 Still not as many synapses and neurons as the human brain.

1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:41.360
 So we still got, we're still beating them on that, we humans are beating the AIs, but they're catching up pretty quickly.

1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:46.360
 You write about modeling of mathematical cognition.

1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:49.360
 So let me first ask about mathematics in general.

1:24:49.360 --> 1:25:00.360
 There's a paper titled Parallel Distributed Processing Approach to Mathematical Cognition, where in the introduction, there's some beautiful discussion of mathematics.

1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:16.360
 And you referenced there Tristan Needham, who criticizes a narrow form of view of mathematics by liking the studying of mathematics as symbol manipulation to studying music without ever hearing a note.

1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:20.360
 So from that perspective, what do you think is mathematics?

1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:23.360
 What is this world of mathematics like?

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:47.360
 Well, I think of mathematics as the set of tools for exploring idealized worlds that often turn out to be extremely relevant to the real world, but need not.

1:25:47.360 --> 1:26:09.360
 But there are worlds in which objects exist with idealized properties and in which the relationships among them can be characterized with precision.

1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:22.360
 So as to allow the implications of certain facts to then allow you to derive other facts with certainty.

1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:51.360
 So if you have two triangles and you know that there is an angle in the first one that has the same measure as an angle in the second one, and you know that the length of the sides adjacent to that angle in each of the two triangles,

1:26:51.360 --> 1:27:03.360
 the corresponding sides adjacent to that angle are also have the same measure, then you can then conclude that the triangles are congruent.

1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:06.360
 That is to say, they have all of their properties in common.

1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:12.360
 And that is something about triangles.

1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:16.360
 It's not a matter of formulas.

1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:18.360
 These are idealized objects.

1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:36.360
 In fact, you know, we built bridges out of triangles and we understand how to measure the height of something we can't climb by extending these ideas about triangles a little further.

1:27:36.360 --> 1:28:00.360
 And you know, all of the ability to get a tiny speck of matter launched from the planet Earth to intersect with some tiny, tiny little body way out and way beyond Pluto somewhere.

1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:08.360
 Exactly a predicted time and date is something that depends on these ideas, right?

1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:22.360
 And it's actually happening in the real physical world that these ideas make contact with it in those kinds of instances.

1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:51.360
 And so, but you know, there are these idealized objects, these triangles or these distances or these points, whatever they are, that allow for this set of tools to be created that then gives human beings the incredible leverage that they didn't have without these concepts.

1:28:51.360 --> 1:29:06.360
 And I think this is actually already true when we think about just, you know, the natural numbers.

1:29:06.360 --> 1:29:23.360
 I always like to include zero, so I'm going to say the non negative integers, but that's that's a place where some people prefer not to include zero, but we like zero here, natural numbers, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and so on.

1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:43.360
 And, and, you know, because they give you the ability to be exact about, like, how many sheep you have, like, you know, I sent you out this morning, there were 23 sheep, you came back with only 22.

1:29:43.360 --> 1:29:44.360
 What happened, right?

1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:47.360
 The fundamental problem of physics, how many sheep you have.

1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:57.360
 It's a fundamental problem of life, of human society that you damn well better bring back the same number of sheep as you started with.

1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:10.360
 And, you know, it allows commerce, it allows contracts, it allows the establishment of records and so on to have systems that allow these things to be notated.

1:30:10.360 --> 1:30:30.360
 But they, they have an inherent aboutness to them, that's one, at the, one at the same time sort of abstract and idealized and generalizable while at the other, on the other hand, potentially very, very grounded and concrete.

1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:57.360
 And one of the things that makes for the incredible achievements of the human mind is the fact that humans invented these idealized systems that leverage the power of human thought in such a way as to allow all this kind of thing to happen.

1:30:57.360 --> 1:31:26.360
 And so that's what mathematics to me is the development of systems for thinking about the properties and relations among sets of idealized objects and, you know, the mathematical notation system that we unfortunately focus way too much on.

1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:36.360
 Is just our way of expressing propositions about these properties.

1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:37.360
 Right.

1:31:37.360 --> 1:31:48.360
 It's just, just like we're talking with Chomsky in language, it's the thing we've invented for the communication of those ideas, they're not necessarily the deep representation of those ideas.

1:31:48.360 --> 1:31:49.360
 Yeah.

1:31:49.360 --> 1:31:58.360
 What, what's a, what's a good way to model such powerful mathematical reasoning, would you say?

1:31:58.360 --> 1:32:02.360
 What are some ideas you have for capturing this in a model?

1:32:02.360 --> 1:32:27.360
 The insights that human mathematicians have had is a combination of the kind of the intuitive kind of connectionist like knowledge that makes it so that something is just like obviously true.

1:32:27.360 --> 1:32:45.360
 So that you don't have to think about why it's true, that then makes it possible to then take the next step and ponder and reason and figure out something that you previously didn't have that intuition about.

1:32:45.360 --> 1:33:02.360
 It then ultimately becomes a part of the intuition that the next generation of mathematical thinkers have to ground their own thinking on so that they can extend the ideas even further.

1:33:02.360 --> 1:33:20.360
 I came across this quotation from Henri Poincaré while I was walking in the, in the woods with my wife in a state park in Northern California late last summer.

1:33:20.360 --> 1:33:32.360
 And what it said on the bench was, it is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover.

1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:59.360
 And so what, for me, the essence of the, of the project is to understand how to bring the intuitive connectionist resources to bear on letting the intuitive discovery arise, you know, from engagement in thinking with this formal system.

1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:22.360
 So I think of, you know, the ability of somebody like Hinton or Newton or Einstein or Rommelhardt or Poincaré to Archimedes, this is another example, right?

1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:50.360
 Because suddenly a flash of insight occurs. It's, it's like the constellation of all of these simultaneous constraints that somehow or other causes the mind to settle into a novel state that it never did before and, and give rise to a new idea that, you know, then you could say,

1:34:50.360 --> 1:35:01.360
 okay, well, now how can I prove this? You know, how do I write down the steps of that theorem that, that allow me to make it rigorous and certain?

1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:30.360
 And so I feel like the, the kinds of things that we're beginning to see deep learning systems do of their own accord kind of gives me this feeling of, of, I don't know, hope or encouragement that ultimately,

1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:56.360
 it'll all happen. So in particular, as many people now have become really interested in thinking about, you know, neural networks that have been trained with massive amounts of text can be given a prompt and they can then

1:35:56.360 --> 1:36:20.360
 sort of generate some really interesting, fanciful creative story from that prompt. And there's, there's kind of like a sense that they've somehow synthesized something like novel out of the, you know, all of the particulars of all

1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:35.360
 of the billions and billions of experiences that went into the training data that, that gives rise to something like this sort of intuitive sense of what would be a fun and interesting little story to tell or something like that.

1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:54.360
 And just sort of wells up out of the, out of the letting the thing play out its own imagining of what somebody might say, given this prompt as a, as an input to, to get it to, to start to generate its own thoughts.

1:36:54.360 --> 1:37:02.360
 And, and to me, that, that sort of represents the potential of capturing this, the intuitive side of this.

1:37:02.360 --> 1:37:18.360
 And there's other examples. I don't know if you will find them as captivating as, you know, on the deep mind side with Alpha zero. If you study chess, the kind of solutions that has come up in terms of chess, it is, it, there's novel ideas there.

1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:45.360
 It's very, like there's brilliant moments of insight and the mechanism they use, if you think of search as, as maybe more towards good old fashioned AI and then there's the connectionist network that has the intuition of looking at a board, looking at a set of patterns and saying how good is this set of positions and the next few positions, how good are those.

1:37:45.360 --> 1:37:48.360
 And that's it. That's just an intuition.

1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:49.360
 Yeah.

1:37:49.360 --> 1:38:00.360
 Grandmasters have this and understanding positionally, tactically, how good the situation is, how, how can it be improved without doing this full, like deep search.

1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:15.360
 And then maybe doing a little bit of what human chess players call calculation, which is the search, taking a particular set of steps down the line to see how they unroll. But there, there is moments of genius in those systems too.

1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:26.360
 So that's another hopeful illustration that from neural networks can emerge this novel creation of an idea.

1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:46.360
 Yes. And I think that, you know, I think Demis Sabus is, you know, he's spoken about those things. He, I heard him describe a move that was made in one of the go matches against Lisa Dahl in this very, in a very similar way.

1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:57.360
 And it caused me to become really excited to kind of collaborate with some of those guys at deep mind.

1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:25.360
 So I think, though, that what, what I like to really emphasize here is one part of what I like to emphasize about mathematical cognition, at least, is that philosophers and logicians going back three or even a little more than 3000 years ago,

1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:44.360
 began to develop these formal systems and gradually the whole idea about thinking formally got constructed.

1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:58.360
 And, you know, it's preceded Euclid, certainly present in the work of Thales and others. And I'm not the world's leading expert in all the details of that history.

1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:27.360
 But Euclid's elements were the kind of the touchpoint of a coherent document that sort of laid out this idea of an actual formal system within which these objects were characterized and the system of inference that

1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:52.360
 allowed new truths to be derived from others was sort of like established as a paradigm. And what, what I find interesting is the idea that the ability to become a person who is capable of thinking

1:40:52.360 --> 1:41:13.360
 in this abstract formal way is, you know, a result of the same kind of immersion in, in experience, thinking in that way that, you know, we now begin to think of our understanding of languages being right.

1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:30.360
 So we immerse ourselves in, in a particular language, in a particular world of objects and their relationships. And we learn to talk about that. And we develop intuitive understanding of the real world in a similar way.

1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:53.360
 We can think that what academia has created for us, what, you know, those early philosophers and their academies and Athens and Alexandria and others, other places allowed was the development of these schools of thought,

1:41:53.360 --> 1:42:16.360
 modes of thought that, that then become deeply ingrained. And, you know, it becomes what it is that makes it so that somebody like Jerry Fodor would think that systematic thought is the essential characteristic of the human mind as

1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:28.360
 opposed to a derived and an acquired characteristic that results from acculturation in a certain mode that's been invented by humans.

1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:48.360
 Would you say it's more fundamental than like language? If we start dancing, if we bring Chomsky back into the conversation? First of all, is it unfair to draw a line between mathematical cognition and language linguistic cognition?

1:42:48.360 --> 1:43:07.360
 I think that's a very interesting question. And I think it's one of the ones that I'm actually very interested in right now. But I think the answer is, in important ways, it is important to draw that line.

1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:17.360
 But then to come back and look at it again and see some of the subtleties and interesting aspects of the difference.

1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:44.360
 So, if we think about Chomsky himself, he was born into an academic family. His father was a professor of rabbinical studies at a small rabbinical college in Philadelphia.

1:43:44.360 --> 1:44:09.360
 And he was deeply inculturated in a culture of thought and reason and brought to the effort to understand natural language this profound engagement with these formal systems.

1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:27.360
 And I think that there was tremendous power in that and that Chomsky had some amazing insights into the structure of natural language.

1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:43.360
 But that, and I'm going to use the word but there, the actual intuitive knowledge of these things only goes so far and does not go as far as it does in people like Chomsky himself.

1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:54.360
 And this was something that was discovered in the PhD dissertation of Lila Gleitman, who was actually trained in the same linguistics department with Chomsky.

1:44:54.360 --> 1:45:21.360
 But what Lila discovered was that the intuitions that linguists had about even the meaning of a phrase, not just about its grammar, but about what they thought a phrase must mean, were very different from the intuitions of an ordinary person

1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:34.360
 who wasn't a formally trained thinker. And well, it recently has become much more salient. I happen to have learned about this when I myself was a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania.

1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:40.360
 But I never knew how to put it together with all of my other thinking about these things.

1:45:40.360 --> 1:46:08.360
 So I actually currently have the hypothesis that formally trained linguists and other formally trained academics, whether it be linguistics, philosophy, cognitive science, computer science, machine learning, mathematics,

1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:35.360
 have a mode of engagement with experience that is intuitively deeply structured to be more organized around the systematicity and ability to be conformant with the principles of a system

1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:42.360
 than is actually true of the natural human mind without that immersion.

1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:53.360
 That's fascinating. So the different fields and approaches with which you start to study the mind actually take you away from the natural operation of the mind.

1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:59.360
 So it makes it very difficult for you to be somebody who introspects.

1:46:59.360 --> 1:47:25.360
 And this is where things about human belief and so called knowledge that we consider private, not our business to manipulate in others.

1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:37.360
 We are not entitled to tell somebody else what to believe about certain kinds of things.

1:47:37.360 --> 1:47:51.360
 What are those beliefs? Well, they are the product of this sort of immersion and enculturation. That is what I believe.

1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:57.360
 And that's limiting. It's something to be aware of.

1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:03.360
 Does that limit you from having a good model of cognition?

1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:05.360
 It can.

1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:22.360
 So when you look at mathematical linguistics, what is that line then? So is Chomsky unable to sneak up to the full picture of cognition? Are you, when you're focusing on mathematical thinking, are you also unable to do so?

1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:45.360
 I think you're right. I think that's a great way of characterizing it. And I also think that it's related to the concept of beginner's mind and another concept called the expert blind spot.

1:48:45.360 --> 1:49:03.360
 So the expert blind spot is much more prosaic seeming than this point that you were just making. But it's something that plagues experts when they try to communicate their understanding to non experts.

1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:23.360
 And that is that things are self evident to them that they can't begin to even think about how they could explain it to somebody else.

1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:34.360
 Because it like, well, it's just like so patently obvious that it must be true.

1:49:34.360 --> 1:50:03.360
 You know, like when Kronecker said, God made the natural numbers, all else is the work of man, he was expressing that intuition that somehow or other, the basic fundamentals of discrete quantities being countable and innumerable and indefinite.

1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:22.360
 You know, indefinite in number was not something that had to be discovered, but he was wrong. It turns out that many cognitive scientists agreed with him for a time.

1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:43.360
 There was a long period of time where the natural numbers were considered to be part of the innate endowment of core knowledge or to use the kind of phrases that Spelke and Kerry used to talk about what they believe are the innate primitives of the human mind.

1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:57.360
 And they no longer believe that. It's actually been more or less accepted by almost everyone that the natural numbers are actually a cultural construction.

1:50:57.360 --> 1:51:05.360
 And it's so interesting to go back and sort of like study those few people who still exist who, you know, who don't have those systems.

1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:21.360
 So this is just an example to me and where, you know, a certain mode of thinking about language itself or a certain mode of thinking about geometry and those kinds of relations.

1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:26.360
 So it becomes so second nature that you don't know what it is that you need to teach.

1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:35.360
 And in fact, we don't really teach it all that explicitly anyway.

1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:45.360
 And it's, you know, you take a math class, the professor sort of teaches it to you the way they understand it.

1:51:45.360 --> 1:51:57.360
 Some of the students in the class sort of like, you know, they get it, they start to get the way of thinking and they can actually do the problems that get put on the homework that the professor thinks are interesting and challenging ones.

1:51:57.360 --> 1:52:05.360
 But most of the students who don't kind of engage as deeply don't ever get, you know.

1:52:05.360 --> 1:52:17.360
 And we think, oh, that man must be brilliant. He must have this special insight, but I, you know, he must have some, you know, biological sort of bit that's different, right?

1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:21.360
 That makes him so that he or she could have that insight.

1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:47.360
 But I'm, although I don't want to dismiss biological individual differences completely, I find it much more interesting to think about the possibility that, you know, it was that difference in the dinner table conversation at the Chomsky House when he was growing up that made it so that he had that cast of mind.

1:52:47.360 --> 1:53:06.360
 Yeah, and there's, there's a few topics we talked about that kind of interconnect because I wonder the better I get at certain things, we humans, the deeper we understand something, what are you starting to then miss about the rest of the world?

1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:25.360
 We talked about David and his degenerative mind. And, you know, when you look in the mirror and wonder how different am I, am I cognitively from the man I was a month ago, from the man I was a year ago?

1:53:25.360 --> 1:53:40.360
 Like what, you know, if I can, having thought about language of Chomsky for, for 10, 20 years, what am I no longer able to see? What is in my blind spot and how big is that?

1:53:40.360 --> 1:53:55.360
 And then to somehow be able to leap back out of your deep, like, structure that you've formed for yourself about thinking about the world, leap back and look at the big picture again, or jump out of your current way of thinking.

1:53:55.360 --> 1:54:15.360
 And to be able to introspect, like, what are the limitations of your mind? Are, how is your mind less powerful than it used to be or more powerful or different, powerful in different ways? So that seems to be a difficult thing to do because we're living, we're looking at the world through the lens of our mind, right?

1:54:15.360 --> 1:54:21.360
 To step outside and introspect is difficult, but it seems necessary if you want to make progress.

1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:47.360
 You know, one of the threads of psychological research that's always been very, I don't know, important to me to be aware of is the idea that our explanations of our own behavior aren't necessarily

1:54:47.360 --> 1:55:04.360
 actually part of the causal process that caused that behavior to occur, or even valid observations of the set of constraints that led to the outcome.

1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:18.360
 But they are post hoc rationalizations that we can give based on information at our disposal about what might have contributed to the result that we came to when asked.

1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:38.360
 And so this is an idea that was introduced in a very important paper by Nisbet and Wilson about, you know, the limits on our ability to be aware of the factors that cause us to make the choices that we make.

1:55:38.360 --> 1:56:04.360
 And, you know, I think it's something that we really ought to be much more cognizant of in general as human beings is that our own insight into exactly why we hold the beliefs that we do and we hold the attitudes and make the choices

1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:15.360
 and feel the feelings that we do is not something that we totally control or totally observe.

1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:36.360
 And it's subject to, you know, our culturally transmitted understanding of what it is that is the mode that we give to explain these things when asked to do so as much as it is about anything else.

1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:48.360
 And so even our ability to introspect and think we have access to our own thoughts is a product of culture and belief, you know, practice.

1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:53.360
 So let me ask you the big question of advice.

1:56:53.360 --> 1:57:03.360
 So you've lived an incredible life in terms of the ideas you've put out into the world in terms of the trajectory you've taken through your career through your life.

1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:19.360
 What advice would you give to young people today in high school and college about how to have a career or how to have a life they can be proud of?

1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:35.360
 Finding the thing that you are intrinsically motivated to engage with and then celebrating that discovery is what it's all about.

1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:51.360
 When I was in college, I struggled with that. I had thought I wanted to be a psychiatrist because I think I was interested in human psychology in high school.

1:57:51.360 --> 1:58:03.360
 And at that time, the only sort of information I had that had anything to do with the psyche was, you know, Freud and Eric Frome and sort of popular psychiatry kinds of things.

1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:08.360
 And so, well, they were psychiatrists, right? So I had to be a psychiatrist.

1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:21.360
 And that meant I had to go to medical school and I got to college and I find myself taking, you know, the first semester of a three quarter physics class and it was mechanics.

1:58:21.360 --> 1:58:28.360
 And this was so far from what it was I was interested in, but it was also too early in the morning in the winter court semester.

1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:50.360
 So I never made it to the physics class. But I wanted about the rest of my freshman year and most of my sophomore year until I found myself in the midst of this situation where around me there was this big revolution happening.

1:58:50.360 --> 1:59:00.360
 I was at Columbia University in 1968 and the Vietnam War is going on. Columbia is building a gym in Morningside Heights, which is part of Harlem.

1:59:00.360 --> 1:59:08.360
 And people are thinking, oh, the big bad rich guys are stealing the parkland that belongs to the people of Harlem.

1:59:08.360 --> 1:59:17.360
 And, you know, they're part of the military industrial complex, which is enslaving us and sending us all off to war in Vietnam.

1:59:17.360 --> 1:59:30.360
 And so there was a big revolution that involved a confluence of black activism and, you know, SDS and social justice and the whole university blew up and got shut down.

1:59:30.360 --> 1:59:39.360
 And I got a chance to sort of think about why people were behaving the way they were in this context.

1:59:39.360 --> 1:59:58.360
 And, you know, I happen to have taken mathematical statistics, I happen to have been taking psychology that quarter and just psych one and somehow things in that space all ran together in my mind and got me really excited about asking questions about why people,

1:59:58.360 --> 2:00:08.360
 what made certain people go into the buildings and not others and things like that. And so suddenly I had a path forward and I had just been wandering around aimlessly.

2:00:08.360 --> 2:00:28.360
 And at the different points in my career, you know, when I think, okay, well, should I take this class or should I just read that book about some idea that I want to understand better, you know,

2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:39.360
 or should I pursue the thing that excites me and interests me or should I, you know, meet some requirement, you know, that's, I always did the latter.

2:00:39.360 --> 2:00:48.360
 So I ended up, my professors in psychology were, thought I was great, they wanted me to go to graduate school.

2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:58.360
 They, they nominated me for Phi Beta Kappa, and I went to the Phi Beta Kappa ceremony and this guy came up and said, oh, are you Magnar Summa?

2:00:58.360 --> 2:01:08.360
 I wasn't even getting honors based on my grades, they just happened to have thought I was interested enough in ideas to belong to Phi Beta Kappa.

2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:22.360
 So, I mean, would it be fair to say you kind of stumbled around a little bit through accidents of too early morning of classes in physics and so on until you discovered intrinsic motivation, as you mentioned.

2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:28.360
 And then that's it, it hooked you and then you celebrate the fact that this happens to human beings.

2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:36.360
 Yeah, like, and what is it that made what I did intrinsically motivating to me?

2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:40.360
 Well, that's interesting and I don't know all the answers to it.

2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:53.360
 And I don't think I want to, I want anybody to think that you should be sort of in any way, I don't know, sanctimonious or anything about it.

2:01:53.360 --> 2:02:00.360
 You know, it's like, I really enjoyed doing statistical analysis of data.

2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:11.360
 I really enjoyed running my own experiment, which was what I got a chance to do in the psychology department that chemistry and physics had never.

2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:20.360
 I never imagined that mere mortals would ever do an experiment in those sciences, except one that was in the textbook that you were told to do in lab class.

2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:33.360
 But in psychology, we were already like, even when I was taking psych one, it turned out we had our own rat and we got to, after two set experiments, we got to, okay, do something you think of, you know, with your rat.

2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:45.360
 You know, so it's the opportunity to do it myself and to bring together a certain set of things that engaged me intrinsically.

2:02:45.360 --> 2:02:58.360
 And I think it has something to do with why certain people turn out to be, you know, profoundly amazing musical geniuses, right?

2:02:58.360 --> 2:03:04.360
 They get immersed in it at an early enough point and it just sort of gets into the fabric.

2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:20.360
 So my little brother had intrinsic motivation for music as we witnessed when he discovered how to put records on the phonograph when he was like 13 months old and recognize which one he wanted to play,

2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:31.360
 not because he could read the labels, but because he could sort of see which ones had which scratches, which were the different, you know, oh, that's rapid espanol and that's, you know.

2:03:31.360 --> 2:03:34.360
 And he enjoyed that, that connected with him somehow.

2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:47.360
 Yeah, and there was something that it fed into and you're extremely lucky if you have that and if you can nurture it and can let it grow and let it be an important part of your life.

2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:54.360
 Yeah, those are the two things is like, be attentive enough to feel it when it comes.

2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:56.360
 Like this is something special.

2:03:56.360 --> 2:04:07.360
 I mean, I don't know, for example, I really like tabular data, like Excel sheets, like it brings me a deep joy.

2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:09.360
 I don't know how useful that is for anything.

2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:12.360
 Well, that's part of what I've talked to you.

2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:13.360
 Exactly.

2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:20.360
 So there's like a million, not a million, but there's a lot of things like that for me and you have to hear that for yourself.

2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:33.360
 And be like, realize this is really joyful, but then the other part that you're mentioning, which is the nurture is take time and stay with it, stay with it a while and see where that takes you in life.

2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:45.360
 Yeah, and I think the motivational engagement results in the immersion that then creates the opportunity to obtain the expertise.

2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:49.360
 So, you know, we could call it the Mozart effect, right?

2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:59.360
 I mean, when I think about Mozart, I think about, you know, the person who was born as the fourth member of the family's drink quartet, right?

2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:05.360
 And they handed him the violin when he was six weeks old.

2:05:05.360 --> 2:05:15.360
 All right, start playing, you know, it's like, and so the level of immersion there was amazingly profound.

2:05:15.360 --> 2:05:28.360
 But hopefully he also had, you know, something, maybe this is where the more sort of the genetic part comes in.

2:05:28.360 --> 2:05:38.360
 Sometimes I think, you know, something in him resonated to the music so that the synergy of the combination of that was so powerful.

2:05:38.360 --> 2:05:53.360
 So that's what I really consider to be the most artifact. It's sort of the synergy of something with experience that then results in the unique flowering of a particular, you know, mind.

2:05:53.360 --> 2:05:59.360
 So I know my siblings and I are all very different from each other.

2:05:59.360 --> 2:06:02.360
 We've all gone in our own different directions.

2:06:02.360 --> 2:06:06.360
 And, you know, I mentioned my younger brother who was very musical.

2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:12.360
 I had my other younger brother was like this amazing like intuitive engineer.

2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:28.360
 And my sister, one of my sisters was passionate about, you know, water conservation well before it was, you know, such a huge, important issue that it is today.

2:06:28.360 --> 2:06:50.360
 So we all sort of somehow find a different thing. And I don't mean to say it isn't tied in with something about us biologically, but it's also when that happens where you can find that then, you know, you can do your thing and you can be excited about it.

2:06:50.360 --> 2:06:58.360
 So people can be excited about fitting people on bicycles as well as excited about making neural networks achieve insights into human cognition, right?

2:06:58.360 --> 2:07:10.360
 Yeah, like for me personally, I've always been excited about love and friendship between humans and just like the actual experience of it.

2:07:10.360 --> 2:07:16.360
 Since I was a child, just observing people around me and also been excited about robots.

2:07:16.360 --> 2:07:22.360
 And there's something in me that thinks I really would love to explore how those two things combine.

2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:28.360
 It doesn't make any sense. A lot of it is also timing just to think of your own career and your own life.

2:07:28.360 --> 2:07:35.360
 You found yourself in certain pieces, places that happened to involve some of the greatest thinkers of our time.

2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:48.360
 And so it just worked out that like you guys developed those ideas and there may be a lot of other people similar to you and they were brilliant and they never found that right connection in place to where the ideas could flourish.

2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:56.360
 So it's timing, it's place, it's people and ultimately the whole ride, you know, it's undirected.

2:07:56.360 --> 2:08:13.360
 Can I ask you about something you mentioned in terms of psychiatry when you were younger? Because I had a similar experience of reading Freud and Carl Jung and just, you know, those kind of popular psychiatry ideas.

2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:26.360
 And that was a dream for me early on in high school to like, I hope to understand the human mind by, somehow psychiatry felt like the right discipline for that.

2:08:26.360 --> 2:08:36.360
 Does that make you sad that psychiatry is not the mechanism by which you are able to explore the human mind?

2:08:36.360 --> 2:08:56.360
 For me, I was a little bit disillusioned because of how much prescription medication and biochemistry is involved in the discipline of psychiatry as opposed to the dream of the Freud like use the mechanisms of language to explore the human mind.

2:08:56.360 --> 2:09:06.360
 So that was a little disappointing. And that's why I kind of went to computer science and thinking like, maybe you can explore the human mind by trying to build the thing.

2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:25.360
 Yes, I wasn't exposed to the sort of the biomedical slash pharmacological aspects of psychiatry at that point because I didn't, I dropped out of that whole idea of premed that I never even found out about that until much later.

2:09:25.360 --> 2:09:37.360
 But you're absolutely right. So I was actually a member of the National Advisory Mental Health Council.

2:09:37.360 --> 2:09:44.360
 That is to say the board of scientists who advised the director of the National Institute of Mental Health.

2:09:44.360 --> 2:10:06.360
 And that was around the year 2000. And in fact, at that time, the man who came in as the new director, I had been on this board for a year when he came in said, okay, schizophrenia is a biological illness.

2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:17.360
 It's a lot like cancer. We've made huge strides in curing cancer. And that's what we're going to do with schizophrenia. We're going to find the medications that are going to cure this disease.

2:10:17.360 --> 2:10:29.360
 And we're not going to listen to anybody's grandmother anymore. And good old behavioral psychology is not something we're going to support any further.

2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:47.360
 And he completely alienated me from the Institute and from all of its prior policies, which had been much more holistic, I think, really at some level.

2:10:47.360 --> 2:11:06.360
 And the other people on the board were like psychiatrists, very biological psychiatrists. It didn't pan out, right? That nothing has changed in our ability to help people with mental illness.

2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:14.360
 And so 20 years later, that particular path was a dead end, as far as I can tell.

2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:21.360
 Well, there's some aspect to and started to romanticize the whole philosophical conversation about the human mind.

2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:37.360
 But to me, psychiatrists for a time held the flag of where the deep thinkers in the same way that physicists are the deep thinkers about the nature of reality, psychiatrists are the deep thinkers about the nature of the human mind.

2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:49.360
 And I think that flag has been taken from them and carried by people like you. It's more in the cognitive psychology, especially when you have a foot in the computational view of the world.

2:11:49.360 --> 2:12:02.360
 Because you can both build it. You can intuit about the functioning of the mind by building little models and be able to say mathematical things and then deploying those models, especially in computers, to say, does this actually work?

2:12:02.360 --> 2:12:17.360
 They do little experiments. And then some combination of neuroscience, where you're starting to actually be able to observe, do certain experience on human beings and observe how the brain is actually functioning.

2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:30.360
 And there, using intuition, you can start being the philosopher, like Richard Feynman is the philosopher, a cognitive psychologist can become the philosopher, and psychiatrists become much more like doctors.

2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:41.360
 They're like very medical. They help people with medication, biochemistry and so on. But they are no longer the book writers and the philosophers, which of course I admire.

2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:51.360
 I admire the Richard Feynman ability to do great low level mathematics and physics and the high level philosophy.

2:12:51.360 --> 2:13:06.360
 Yeah. I think it was from and young more than Freud that was sort of initially kind of like made me feel like, oh, this is really amazing and interesting and I want to explore it further.

2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:20.360
 I actually, when I got to college and I lost that thread, I found more of it in sociology and literature than I did in any place else.

2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:27.360
 So I took quite a lot of both of those disciplines as an undergraduate.

2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:46.360
 And, you know, I was actually deeply ambivalent about the psychology because I was doing experiments after the initial flurry of interest in why people would occupy buildings during an insurrection and consider, you know,

2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:51.360
 that be sort of like so over committed to their beliefs.

2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:56.360
 But I ended up in the psychology laboratory running experiments on pigeons.

2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:13.360
 And so I had these profound sort of like dissonance between, okay, the kinds of issues that would be explored when I was thinking about what I read about in modern British literature

2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:17.360
 versus what I could study with my pigeons in the laboratory.

2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:22.360
 That got resolved when I went to graduate school and I discovered cognitive psychology.

2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:42.360
 And so for me, that was the path out of this sort of like extremely sort of ambivalent divergence between the interest in the human condition and the desire to do, you know, actual mechanistically oriented thinking about it.

2:14:42.360 --> 2:15:03.360
 And I think we've come a long way in that regard and that you're absolutely right that nowadays this is something that's accessible to people through the pathway in through computer science or the pathway in through neuroscience.

2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:18.360
 You know, you can get derailed in neuroscience down to the bottom of the system where you might find the cures of various conditions, but you don't get a chance to think about the higher level stuff.

2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:30.360
 So it's in the systems and cognitive neuroscience and computational intelligence miasma up there at the top that I think these opportunities are most are richest right now.

2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:38.360
 And so yes, I am indeed blessed by having had the opportunity to fall into that space.

2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:49.360
 So you mentioned the human condition, speaking of which you happen to be a human being who's unfortunately not immortal.

2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:54.360
 That seems to be a fundamental part of the human condition that this right ends.

2:15:54.360 --> 2:16:04.360
 Do you think about the fact that you're going to die one day? Are you afraid of death?

2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:14.360
 I would say that I am not as much afraid of death as I am of degeneration.

2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:27.360
 And I say that in part for reasons of having, you know, seen some tragic degenerative situations unfold.

2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:45.360
 It's exciting when you can continue to participate and feel like you're near the place where the wave is breaking on the shore.

2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:58.360
 If you like, you know, and I think about, you know, my own future potential.

2:16:58.360 --> 2:17:13.360
 If I were to undergo a begin to suffer from dementia, Alzheimer's disease or semantic dementia or some other condition, you know, I would sort of gradually lose the thread of that ability.

2:17:13.360 --> 2:17:32.360
 And so one can live on for several, for a decade after, you know, sort of having to retire because one no longer has these kinds of abilities to engage.

2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:35.360
 And I think that's the thing that I fear the most.

2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:46.360
 The losing of that, like the breaking of the way, the flourishing of the mind where you could have these ideas and they're swimming around, you're able to play with them.

2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:57.360
 Yeah, and collaborate with other people who, you know, are themselves really helping to push these ideas forward.

2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:00.360
 What about the edge of the cliff?

2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:05.360
 The end, I mean, the mystery of it.

2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:27.360
 The migrated sort of conception of mind and, you know, sort of continuous sort of way of thinking about most things makes it so that, to me, the discreteness of that transition is less apparent than it seems to be to most people.

2:18:27.360 --> 2:18:31.360
 I see, I see, yeah.

2:18:31.360 --> 2:18:50.360
 Yeah, I wonder, so I don't know if you know the work of Ernest Becker and so on, I wonder what role mortality and our ability to be cognizant of it and anticipate it and perhaps be afraid of it, what role that plays in our reasoning of the world.

2:18:50.360 --> 2:18:56.360
 I think that it can be motivating to people to think they have a limited period left.

2:18:56.360 --> 2:19:21.360
 I think in my own case, you know, it's like seven or eight years ago now that I was sitting around doing experiments on decision making that were satisfying in a certain way because I could really get closure on what, whether the model fit the data perfectly or not.

2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:30.360
 And I could see how one could test, you know, the predictions in monkeys as well as humans and really see what the neurons were doing.

2:19:30.360 --> 2:19:37.360
 But I just realized, hey, wait a minute, you know, I may only have about 10 or 15 years left here.

2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:46.360
 And I don't feel like I'm getting towards the answers to the really interesting questions while I'm doing this particular level of work.

2:19:46.360 --> 2:19:50.360
 And that's when I said to myself, okay,

2:19:50.360 --> 2:19:55.360
 let's pick something that's hard, you know.

2:19:55.360 --> 2:19:58.360
 So that's when I started working on mathematical cognition.

2:19:58.360 --> 2:20:06.360
 And I think it was more in terms of, well, I got 15 more years, possibly of useful life left.

2:20:06.360 --> 2:20:09.360
 Let's imagine that it's only 10.

2:20:09.360 --> 2:20:13.360
 I'm actually getting close to the end of that now, maybe three or four more years.

2:20:13.360 --> 2:20:21.360
 But I'm beginning to feel like, well, I probably have another five after that. So, okay, I'll give myself another six or eight.

2:20:21.360 --> 2:20:23.360
 But a deadline is looming.

2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:25.360
 It's not going to go on forever.

2:20:25.360 --> 2:20:34.360
 And so, yeah, I got to keep thinking about the questions that I think are the interesting and important ones for sure.

2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:37.360
 What do you hope your legacy is?

2:20:37.360 --> 2:20:42.360
 You've done some incredible work in your life as a man, as a scientist.

2:20:42.360 --> 2:20:51.360
 When the aliens and the human civilization is long gone and the aliens are reading the encyclopedia about the human species.

2:20:51.360 --> 2:20:55.360
 What do you hope is the paragraph written about you?

2:20:55.360 --> 2:21:22.360
 I would want it to sort of highlight a couple things that I was, you know, able to see one path that was more exciting to me

2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:28.360
 than the one that seemed already to be there for a cognitive psychologist, you know.

2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:35.360
 But not for any super special reason other than that I'd had the right context prior to that,

2:21:35.360 --> 2:21:39.360
 but that I had gone ahead and followed that lead, you know.

2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:56.360
 And I forget the exact wording, but I said in this preface that the joy of science is the moment in which, you know,

2:21:56.360 --> 2:22:15.360
 a partially formed thought in the mind of one person gets crystallized a little better in the discourse and becomes the foundation of some exciting concrete piece of actual scientific progress.

2:22:15.360 --> 2:22:21.360
 And I feel like that, you know, moment happened when Rommelhardt and I were doing the interactive activation model.

2:22:21.360 --> 2:22:31.360
 And when Rommelhardt heard Hinton talk about gradient descent and having the objective function to guide the learning process.

2:22:31.360 --> 2:22:42.360
 And it happened a lot in that period and I sort of seek that kind of thing in my collaborations with my students, right?

2:22:42.360 --> 2:23:00.360
 So, you know, the idea that this is a person who contributed to science by finding exciting collaborative opportunities to engage with other people through is something that I certainly hope is part of the paragraph.

2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:12.360
 And like you said, taking a step maybe in directions that are non obvious. So, it's the old Robert Frost road less taken.

2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:22.360
 So, maybe because you said like this incomplete initial idea, that step you take is a little bit off the beaten path.

2:23:22.360 --> 2:23:35.360
 If I could just say one more thing here. This was something that really contributed to energizing me in a way that I feel it would be useful to share.

2:23:35.360 --> 2:23:44.360
 My PhD dissertation project was completely empirical experimental project.

2:23:44.360 --> 2:23:53.360
 And I wrote a paper based on the two main experiments that were the core of my dissertation and I submitted it to a journal.

2:23:53.360 --> 2:24:11.360
 And at the end of the paper, I had a little section where I laid out my, the beginnings of my theory about what I thought was going on that would explain the data that I had collected.

2:24:11.360 --> 2:24:16.360
 And I had submitted the paper to the Journal of Experimental Psychology.

2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:24.360
 So, I got back a letter from the editor saying, thank you very much. These are great experiments and we'd love to publish them in the journal.

2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:32.360
 But what we'd like you to do is to leave the theorizing to the theorists and take that part out of the paper.

2:24:32.360 --> 2:24:45.360
 And so I did, I took that part out of the paper. But, you know, I almost found myself labeled as a non theorist, right, by this.

2:24:45.360 --> 2:24:53.360
 And I could have like succumbed to that and said, okay, well, I guess my job is to just go on and do experiments, right?

2:24:53.360 --> 2:25:08.360
 But that's not what I wanted to do. And so when I got to my assistant professorship, although I continued to do experiments because I knew I had to get some papers out,

2:25:08.360 --> 2:25:21.360
 I also, at the end of my first year, submitted my first article to Psychological Review, which was the theoretical journal where I took that section and elaborated it and wrote it up and submitted it to them.

2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:28.360
 And they didn't accept that either. But they said, oh, this is interesting. You should keep thinking about it this time.

2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:38.360
 And then that was what got me going to think, okay, you know, so it's not a superhuman thing to contribute to the development of theory.

2:25:38.360 --> 2:25:44.360
 You know, you don't have to be, you can do it as a mere mortal.

2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:52.360
 And the broader, I think, lessons don't succumb to the labels of a particular viewer.

2:25:52.360 --> 2:25:55.360
 Or anybody labeling you, right?

2:25:55.360 --> 2:26:05.360
 Exactly. I mean, that, yeah, exactly. And especially as you become successful, your labels get assigned to you for that, you're successful for that thing.

2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:09.360
 Yeah, I'm a connectionist or a cognitive scientist and not a neuroscientist.

2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:19.360
 And then you can completely, that's just, that's the stories of the past. You're today a new person that can completely revolutionize in totally new areas.

2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:23.360
 So don't let those labels hold you back.

2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:27.360
 Well, let me ask the big question.

2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:36.360
 When you look into, you said it started with Columbia trying to observe these humans and they're doing weird stuff and you want to know why are they doing this stuff.

2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:44.360
 So zoom out even bigger at the 100 plus billion people who've ever lived on earth.

2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:51.360
 Why do you think we're all doing what we're doing? What do you think is the meaning of it all? The big why question?

2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:58.360
 We seem to be very busy doing a bunch of stuff and we seem to be kind of directed towards somewhere.

2:26:58.360 --> 2:27:02.360
 But why?

2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:17.360
 Well, I myself think that we make meaning for ourselves and that we find inspiration in the meaning that other people have made in the past.

2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:43.360
 And the great religious thinkers of the first millennium BC and few that came in the early part of the second millennium laid down some important foundations for us.

2:27:43.360 --> 2:28:03.360
 But I do believe that we are an emergent result of a process that happened naturally without guidance and that meaning is what we make of it

2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:29.360
 and that the creation of efforts to reify meaning in like religious traditions and so on is just a part of the expression of that goal that we have to, you know, not find out what the meaning is but to make it ourselves.

2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:56.360
 And so to me, it's something that's very personal. It's very individual. It's like meaning will come for you through the particular combination of synergistic elements that are your fabric and your experience and your context

2:28:56.360 --> 2:29:09.360
 and you know, you should, it's all made in a certain kind of a local context though, right?

2:29:09.360 --> 2:29:35.360
 And what, here I am at UCSD with this brilliant man, Rommelhart, who's having, you know, these doubts about symbolic artificial intelligence that resonate with my desire to see it grounded in the biology and let's make the most of that, you know.

2:29:35.360 --> 2:29:58.360
 Yeah. And so, and so from that, like little pocket, there's some kind of peculiar little emergent process that then, which is basically each one of us, each one of us humans is a kind of, you know, you think cells and they come together and it's an emergent process that then tells fancy stories about itself.

2:29:58.360 --> 2:30:19.360
 And then gets, just like you said, just enjoys the beauty of the stories we tell about ourselves. It's an emergent process that lives for a time, is defined by its local pocket and context in time and space and then tells pretty stories and we write those stories down and then we celebrate how nice the stories are.

2:30:19.360 --> 2:30:33.360
 And then it continues because we build stories on top of each other and eventually we'll colonize hopefully other planets, other solar systems, other galaxies and we'll tell even better stories.

2:30:33.360 --> 2:30:56.360
 But it all starts here on Earth. Jay, you're speaking of peculiar emergent processes that lived one heck of a story. You're one of the great scientists of cognitive science, of psychology, of computation.

2:30:56.360 --> 2:31:06.360
 It's a huge honor you would talk to me today that you spend your very valuable time. I really enjoy talking with you and thank you for all the work you've done. I can't wait to see what you do next.

2:31:06.360 --> 2:31:23.360
 Well, thank you so much. And I, you know, this has been an amazing opportunity for me to let ideas that I've never fully expressed before come out because you ask such a wide range of, you know, the deeper questions that we've all been thinking about for so long.

2:31:23.360 --> 2:31:24.360
 So thank you very much for that.

2:31:24.360 --> 2:31:26.360
 Thank you.

2:31:54.360 --> 2:31:59.360
 Thank you.
