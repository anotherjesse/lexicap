00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
 The following is a conversation with Michael Minna, his second time on the podcast.

00:04.800 --> 00:10.240
 He's a professor at Harvard doing research on infectious disease and immunology.

00:10.960 --> 00:17.840
 In my view, the most powerful, doable, and obvious solution to COVID 19 from the very beginning

00:17.840 --> 00:23.600
 is rapid at home testing. This is what Michael has been talking about and writing about since

00:23.600 --> 00:29.200
 the beginning of the pandemic. The accuracy of these tests is high for the task of detecting

00:29.200 --> 00:34.720
 contagiousness, which is what matters. Hundreds of millions can be manufactured quickly and

00:34.720 --> 00:40.640
 relatively cheaply. Privacy and individual freedoms are preserved. I believe that if you

00:40.640 --> 00:46.480
 give people the power of information, information about whether they are contagious or not,

00:46.480 --> 00:52.080
 they will do the right thing at scale, all while respecting their freedom and minimizing

00:52.080 --> 00:56.800
 the destructive effects of the pandemic on our health and our economy.

00:56.800 --> 01:02.800
 This solution was obvious in May of 2020. It was obvious when Michael and I spoke the first

01:02.800 --> 01:10.000
 time a year ago and it is obvious today. We talk about why it has not yet been done and how we can

01:10.000 --> 01:16.400
 still do it. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:16.400 --> 01:21.120
 in the description. And now, here's my conversation with Michael Minna.

01:21.120 --> 01:29.200
 Michael Minna. We spoke a year ago about rapid at home testing and I think you think it should

01:29.200 --> 01:35.520
 have been, still should be a big part of the solution to COVID. So, let's recap. Where do

01:35.520 --> 01:44.080
 things stand today in terms of rapid at home testing? Well, it's certainly something that

01:44.080 --> 01:52.480
 you're right. I do think we should have them today. We've now had almost 20 months of living in

01:52.480 --> 01:58.720
 anxiety, uncertainty, being afraid for our health, for our family's health, for our friends,

01:59.280 --> 02:04.560
 shutdowns, economic instability. Everything has been uncertain because of this virus.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.680
 And then there's this little test. And it's the first time for many people that they are

02:09.680 --> 02:14.880
 they're using it and they're feeling empowered. They're feeling like they can control their little

02:14.880 --> 02:22.000
 slice of this pandemic. So, as these tests have come out and more and more and more Americans

02:22.000 --> 02:27.200
 have had an opportunity to go and buy them from CVS or Walgreens or wherever they're at,

02:28.720 --> 02:35.200
 I think that it's really shifting the tenor of the discussion. For a long time, all of 2020,

02:35.200 --> 02:42.880
 it was like I often felt like it was me and a few other people against the world. These tests

02:42.880 --> 02:47.600
 should be public health tools. These tests are infectiousness indicators. They shouldn't be

02:47.600 --> 02:54.320
 compared to PCR. All of these different things we could of course go through and recap what the

02:54.320 --> 03:01.120
 benefits and the metrics are that we should be looking at. But the point is last year and most

03:01.120 --> 03:07.040
 of this year was about educating scientists, educating public health leaders, educating

03:07.040 --> 03:14.320
 physicians to get them to understand that there is a different reason to test in a pandemic than

03:14.320 --> 03:19.040
 purely diagnostics and transmission blockade and severing transmission chains is a big one.

03:19.040 --> 03:23.520
 So, now I think we're at a point where people are now understanding and they're understanding

03:23.520 --> 03:27.360
 because they are feeling it. They're holding it and they're doing it and they're seeing they're

03:27.360 --> 03:33.360
 feeling the delight of seeing a negative and saying, I feel more comfortable. It's not perfect,

03:33.360 --> 03:40.240
 but it's pretty darn close to perfect to allowing me to go and see my mom without mistakenly

03:40.240 --> 03:46.080
 infecting her or whatever the story might be. And now that that's happening, I think

03:46.800 --> 03:52.880
 all of a sudden we're seeing a massive change politically for these tests. Biden just came

03:52.880 --> 03:57.760
 out the COVID 19 action plan the other day and one of the main pillars of it was testing and in

03:57.760 --> 04:06.080
 particular bringing rapid tests, scaling them up. So, on that front, I think finally there is

04:06.080 --> 04:11.920
 success. People are actually understanding and I haven't stopped beating this drum for far too

04:11.920 --> 04:18.960
 long and I like hate rapid tests now. So, maybe it's good to step back. Would you say most Americans

04:18.960 --> 04:24.320
 have not taken a rapid at home test? Absolutely. Most have definitely not taken a rapid test.

04:24.320 --> 04:30.480
 So, like many of them probably don't know. They kind of probably say testing, they have like

04:30.480 --> 04:37.600
 memories of testing, like PCR testing, they have to go into somewhere and they have to like a swab

04:37.600 --> 04:42.880
 deep in their nose and that's the experience. Or maybe if you have to travel like Canada or

04:42.880 --> 04:48.160
 something like that, you have to get tested, that kind of stuff. So, what are rapid at home tests?

04:48.160 --> 04:55.920
 Yeah. So, the rapid at home tests are, I like to call them paper strip tests, simple. They're

04:55.920 --> 05:01.280
 simple tests that, I wish I brought some today, but I didn't. They're simple tests that

05:03.280 --> 05:08.720
 you swab at the moment, most of them use a swab that you just swab the front of your nose. So,

05:08.720 --> 05:15.600
 it's not one of the deep swabs that goes into your brain. And so, it's not very uncomfortable.

05:15.600 --> 05:22.720
 It's just like picking your nose if you all, and you put that swab in. You put that swab into

05:23.520 --> 05:30.320
 a little tube and the tube has some liquid in it and then you put a few drops of that liquid

05:30.320 --> 05:36.400
 onto a paper strip or you drop the paper strip into the tube just like one of those indicators

05:36.400 --> 05:42.160
 for the pool. And if you just like a pregnancy test, then if you get two lines, you're positive,

05:42.160 --> 05:47.680
 one line, you're negative. It's super simple. It takes 30 seconds once you know how to do it of

05:47.680 --> 05:54.880
 hands on time and you wait around 10 minutes and then you read the result. They are extraordinarily

05:54.880 --> 06:03.840
 effective to answer one question, am I infectious? And that is the public health question that we

06:03.840 --> 06:11.040
 need to answer and consistently ask during this pandemic. Are you infectious? Am I infectious?

06:11.040 --> 06:17.440
 Because it's only when we know that we're infectious that we can be empowered to not mistakenly infect

06:17.440 --> 06:25.920
 others. The PCR test is a little different. And we can go into the pros and cons, but

06:27.360 --> 06:35.440
 one of the major differences is that a PCR test gets a lot of people talking about the PCR test

06:35.440 --> 06:44.480
 say it's much more sensitive. And at an analytical level, it is. It can detect one molecule instead

06:44.480 --> 06:52.720
 of 100,000. But for public health, we don't want a test that can detect one molecule. In fact,

06:52.720 --> 06:59.040
 that has created a net negative for public health. We just want to know, am I infectious? And to know

06:59.040 --> 07:06.320
 that question, to know if I'm infectious, I only need a test that is going to be positive if I have

07:06.320 --> 07:12.000
 a high viral load, like a million. And when the virus grows so fast, it will grow from zero to

07:12.000 --> 07:17.600
 a billion in a day. So you don't really need, even on the front end of an infection, you don't need

07:17.600 --> 07:23.520
 better sensitivity if the tradeoff is that you don't get the result for one, two, or three days.

07:23.520 --> 07:29.360
 You absolutely want a rapid result that can tell you, yes, you're infectious, you're transmitting

07:29.360 --> 07:35.840
 to others right now. And I'm going to give you the result right now. So it is a much more effective

07:35.840 --> 07:41.520
 tool, because it's fast, because it's accessible, we can use them in the home. And there's some

07:41.520 --> 07:45.840
 issues with using them at home, we can talk a little bit about what those issues are, like

07:45.840 --> 07:50.320
 reporting and how do you is everything on the honor system, if you have a test that you're

07:50.320 --> 07:57.280
 taking at home and you use it to go to work. But they can be accessible. PCR has to go into a lab.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.760
 It takes a lot of time for somebody to get a PCR test. They either have to go online and order it,

08:01.760 --> 08:06.160
 it takes the next day for it to come back. They swab themself, they ship it out the next day,

08:06.160 --> 08:11.520
 and then they get a result two days later. That's four days minimum for the most part. And

08:12.400 --> 08:16.080
 at that point, you're not even infectious, even if you did happen to be infectious when you first

08:16.080 --> 08:21.440
 ordered the test. So it's really of the speed of these tests and the accessibility and distribution

08:21.440 --> 08:26.000
 of them that makes them so immensely powerful. So you have this like amazing graphic you tweeted.

08:26.640 --> 08:33.120
 It's exactly what you're saying, which is a rapid antigen test answers the question,

08:33.120 --> 08:38.320
 am I currently infectious? And you have, I think, a comparison of three different, sorry, seven

08:38.320 --> 08:45.360
 different tests based on the viral load. And based on the viral load across these different tests,

08:45.360 --> 08:51.520
 you look at the likelihood of infectiousness. So what is this graphic show? We can overlay that

08:51.520 --> 08:56.960
 for people. I think it's just really nice and really clear. Yeah. So what that's showing is that

08:57.520 --> 09:02.480
 we can never ask what's the sensitivity of a test and just let that be the answer. That's what

09:02.480 --> 09:09.040
 the FDA does currently. And that question doesn't mean anything. We have to say, what is the sensitivity

09:09.040 --> 09:14.800
 of the test to detect what? And so we can have different viral loads, for example, we can have,

09:15.760 --> 09:22.160
 you can have a viral load of one, or you can have a viral load of a trillion. And a PCR test will

09:22.720 --> 09:29.440
 tell you that you are positive, regardless of whether it's one or a trillion. Now, so we can't

09:29.440 --> 09:34.560
 ask the question, how sensitive is a rapid test compared to PCR? Because that covers the whole

09:34.560 --> 09:40.000
 gamut. What we really want to say is how sensitive is the rapid test to detect me if I am infectious?

09:40.640 --> 09:48.640
 And that gets to about 97% or so sensitive. If the question is, how likely is it to detect me

09:48.640 --> 09:53.440
 if I'm a super spreader? That's a really important one to be able to detect. They're all about 100%

09:53.440 --> 09:57.840
 sensitive. So if you have extraordinarily high viral loads to the point where you might be a

09:57.840 --> 10:03.120
 super spreader, these simple rapid tests will essentially always catch you and tell you you're

10:03.120 --> 10:09.600
 positive. And then as you go down the line, if you're no longer infectious at all, then these

10:09.600 --> 10:16.800
 rapid tests might have a 0% sensitivity compared to PCR. But that's actually a good thing. The FDA

10:16.800 --> 10:21.200
 and others look at it as though it's a bad thing, because they average it all together and say, oh,

10:21.840 --> 10:28.480
 this is only a 40% sensitive test compared to PCR. But that's not the right way to look at it. You

10:28.480 --> 10:32.400
 want to say, well, out of all of the samples, how many of them were not transmissible? How many were

10:32.400 --> 10:37.760
 mid, moderate, high, extremely high super spreader? And you should at the very least create a weighted

10:37.760 --> 10:43.360
 average based on transmissibility potential. We don't do that. And that's why nobody in America

10:43.360 --> 10:50.160
 has these tests because that's why they're very rare, because we have slowed down their authorization

10:50.160 --> 10:56.080
 because of that misunderstanding that they don't have to be 80% or 90% sensitive compared to any

10:56.080 --> 11:03.840
 time PCR positivity. They need to be 80 or 90% or more if you're infectious. And for that question,

11:03.840 --> 11:09.440
 they're like 95 up to 100% sensitive when you're most infectious. So we have a lot of

11:09.440 --> 11:15.440
 viral particles in you. So that's what it means. When you say viral load, that means you're going

11:15.440 --> 11:21.120
 to be very infectious. The more you have, the more infectious you are. And this test is basically

11:21.120 --> 11:30.000
 very good at detecting when you're very infectious. Why don't we have a rapid at home test? So you

11:30.000 --> 11:35.600
 said there's a bit of confusion. FDA is involved. You've talked about, you continue to talk about

11:36.800 --> 11:41.760
 that these at home tests are classified as, I guess, medical devices.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.560
 That's right.

11:42.560 --> 11:46.080
 And so because of that FDA is looking at them differently,

11:46.080 --> 11:53.760
 then they probably should be looked at. So what's the problem here? Can you sort of explain what

11:53.760 --> 11:59.440
 does it mean to be a medical device? Why is that an issue? Where's the FDA messing up?

11:59.440 --> 12:05.600
 When we declare something as a medical device and we evaluate it as a medical device, then it makes

12:05.600 --> 12:11.600
 sense that the comparison, if you're trying to get a new one onto the market, that the comparison

12:11.600 --> 12:17.920
 that the comparison would be against a gold standard medical device for that purpose. So PCR

12:18.800 --> 12:26.640
 is currently the gold standard or at least in the eyes of the FDA. The PCR test is the gold standard

12:27.920 --> 12:34.640
 medical device. And as a physician, that's because it's so sensitive. As a physician,

12:34.640 --> 12:39.600
 I have one patient in front of me at a time. And that patient comes to me and I don't have

12:39.600 --> 12:47.600
 to care about the 99.999% of people in the world who are not in front of me. I only care about that

12:47.600 --> 12:52.240
 one patient. And so when I get a sample from that patient and that patient saying, Doc,

12:53.040 --> 12:56.480
 you know, I don't feel well, I haven't been feeling well for the last few weeks. Do you think this

12:56.480 --> 13:04.800
 is COVID? Well, for that question, I want to have the absolute best sensitivity test, regardless of

13:04.800 --> 13:09.360
 what it means for transmissibility, because my patient isn't sitting in my office saying, Doc,

13:09.360 --> 13:14.400
 do you think I'm infectious? They're saying, Doc, do you think I have recently been or am

13:14.400 --> 13:20.320
 infected? And these are totally different things. One is medicine. And if the patient's

13:20.320 --> 13:24.400
 infected, you know, the time isn't of the essence because they're sitting there in my office. I

13:24.400 --> 13:29.680
 can say, look, I'm sorry, you're not feeling well. Let's get a PCR test on you. We'll be able to tell

13:29.680 --> 13:36.560
 you if you have any evidence that there has been recently an infection inside of you. And you'll

13:36.560 --> 13:42.320
 get the result in a couple of days. And it might be expensive and so insurance is going to pay for

13:42.320 --> 13:47.120
 it. And you're just one person. And so I don't really care how many resources it takes to get

13:47.120 --> 13:53.120
 you this answer. On the other hand, there's rapid, there's public health testing and public health

13:53.120 --> 13:59.520
 testing is it has to account for all of the people you're not seeing as well as the person you're

13:59.520 --> 14:05.840
 testing at the moment. So accessibility becomes a central theme. Frequency of tests, it has to

14:05.840 --> 14:10.000
 account for all the days that you're not sitting there in front of your doctor's office getting

14:10.000 --> 14:15.280
 a test as well as the one you are. So it has to say how frequently what if you're infected tomorrow,

14:15.280 --> 14:20.880
 but you're at the doctor's office today getting a negative COVID test. That PCR test at the doctor's

14:20.880 --> 14:26.160
 office today is going to do nothing to let you know that you get exposed and infected tomorrow.

14:26.160 --> 14:33.680
 The only way to know that is to be testing yourself frequently. So and the reason it matters is that

14:33.680 --> 14:40.960
 these tests can be accessible if we are okay with saying the real purpose of a public health test is

14:40.960 --> 14:45.920
 to answer the question, am I infectious? The reason we want to answer that is if you're infectious,

14:45.920 --> 14:53.600
 that's when you isolate. We actually don't want to isolate positive PCR positive individuals

14:53.600 --> 15:00.160
 who are no longer infectious. That's bad public health practice. If I haven't been infectious for

15:00.160 --> 15:05.120
 three weeks, I don't want to have somebody tell me that I need to go and isolate for 10 days just

15:05.120 --> 15:11.200
 because I happened to use a PCR test today, three weeks after I was infectious. And furthermore,

15:11.200 --> 15:17.040
 I definitely don't want the public health agency to come and round up all the people I was with

15:17.040 --> 15:22.000
 last night and say you guys have to quarantine for 14 days because you were with Michael who

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
 wasn't infectious yesterday. It's nonsensical to do that.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.440
 And it's a huge disincentive to actually get tested.

15:29.440 --> 15:33.840
 That's exactly right. Huge disincentive to get tested. People, if it's too sensitive,

15:33.840 --> 15:39.440
 especially with flights, things like that, we shouldn't be stopping people from taking a flight

15:39.440 --> 15:45.840
 if they haven't been infectious for 60 days. And to be clear, people are only infectious for,

15:45.840 --> 15:52.400
 I don't know, somewhere between three and seven days, but can be positive on a PCR test for 30 to

15:52.400 --> 15:59.280
 70 days. So I mean, it's potentially a tenfold difference in terms of how long your PCR positive

15:59.280 --> 16:05.280
 versus how long you're infectious. So we don't want to be taking people during those 30 to 70 days

16:05.280 --> 16:09.760
 and saying you need to isolate just because you go and get a swab or you can't go on your trip

16:09.760 --> 16:17.840
 just because you had COVID last month. That's not good use of a test. So the reason we don't

16:17.840 --> 16:25.520
 have these tools right now is because when we evaluate an antirapid test as a medical device,

16:26.080 --> 16:32.960
 the FDA says, well, this has to achieve the properties that we expect from a medical device,

16:32.960 --> 16:38.160
 which again, doesn't have to take time into account, doesn't really have to take cost or

16:38.160 --> 16:43.520
 resources or scalability or access into account. It only takes sensitivity and specificity to

16:43.520 --> 16:53.440
 catch molecules. And so just by definition, I mean, it is a mathematical fact that if you

16:53.440 --> 16:58.400
 have a perfect public health test for COVID, which means that it would be 100% sensitive

16:59.040 --> 17:05.920
 and 100% specific for contagious people or for the infectious stage of an infection,

17:05.920 --> 17:15.520
 then it literally can't. It is an impossibility for that test to achieve an 80% sensitivity

17:15.520 --> 17:21.040
 at a population level against a medical device, which is what the FDA asks for. And that's because

17:21.760 --> 17:28.240
 you're only infectious for maybe 20%. So theoretically, it should only have a 20%

17:28.240 --> 17:34.800
 sensitivity against the PCR while still being a perfect medical, a perfect public health test.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.720
 And the test is answering the question, am I infectious? That's what you're testing for,

17:38.720 --> 17:42.720
 not for the exact counting of the viron particles in your system.

17:42.720 --> 17:51.680
 That's exactly right. Okay, so why are we still here? So have you had conversations with folks?

17:51.680 --> 17:57.840
 You said that there's a bunch of leaders that are kind of starting to wake up to this idea,

17:57.840 --> 18:04.560
 but why is this taking so long? Why don't we still have hundreds of millions of at home tests?

18:06.320 --> 18:12.480
 The reason it's taking long, I think, is because every agency and government

18:13.280 --> 18:20.720
 is generally deferential to the FDA. And in this context, I would argue that government

18:20.720 --> 18:27.280
 hasn't been particularly creative. So for example, last year, when Trump was still president,

18:27.280 --> 18:32.800
 I would, or in the transition, I recall talking to the White House a number of times and saying,

18:33.760 --> 18:37.760
 here's a plan to give us our lives back. I think that was actually the title of the Atlantic

18:37.760 --> 18:45.200
 article. And this plan can stop shutdowns, it can stop outbreaks, it can allow society to

18:45.200 --> 18:51.920
 keep running and could have prevented the outbreaks of last winter and fall and saved hundreds of

18:51.920 --> 18:57.760
 thousands of lives. So when I bring that to the White House or to the government, the federal

18:57.760 --> 19:03.760
 government, whoever it might be, and I say, here's a plan, this would work. They say, what I get back

19:03.760 --> 19:09.360
 is this sounds really interesting, Michael. It looks like it checks out, but there's one problem.

19:09.360 --> 19:14.080
 We don't have the test. There's no scale. And that's kind of where it all dropped. It's like this

19:14.080 --> 19:20.880
 defeatist attitude of like, oh, don't have the test, so we can't act on it. But now it's really

19:20.880 --> 19:25.200
 changing. Well, and so that's really where things have been. And so nobody's paid attention. It's

19:25.200 --> 19:30.240
 always been this like esoteric thing that, yeah, maybe one day we'll get around to it. But really,

19:30.240 --> 19:36.080
 it's not that important. And the pandemic's going away. But this was like 100% predictable,

19:36.080 --> 19:40.000
 everything that's happening today. We predicted it last year. It's not,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.960
 it's isn't like rocket science or anything. The variants and all those kinds of things.

19:43.680 --> 19:50.160
 So the FDA, we can start to understand why, but also one question I want to ask,

19:50.160 --> 19:55.280
 is it possible to go around the FDA? Yeah. So why has the FDA not changed?

19:57.520 --> 20:04.160
 And why has nobody tried to push the FDA to change? Like, I think what the real reason is the FDA

20:05.440 --> 20:10.640
 has one job around these tests. And it is to authorize them as medical devices. They haven't

20:10.640 --> 20:16.720
 been charged with doing anything else. So in their eyes, they're doing exactly what they're

20:16.720 --> 20:22.720
 supposed to do. They're evaluating these tests as medical devices and they're telling company

20:22.720 --> 20:28.320
 after company after company, sorry, you don't make the cut. And the only way to make the cut is really

20:28.320 --> 20:34.320
 to kind of skew your clinical trials to favor the rapid test being positive, which isn't really

20:34.320 --> 20:40.480
 good practice. We shouldn't be trying to skew clinical trials. But that's kind of what's happened.

20:40.480 --> 20:47.440
 It's been forced upon the companies to do that. And so I think the FDA truly believes from the

20:47.440 --> 20:52.560
 bottom of their heart that they are doing the right thing here. And I would argue that to an

20:52.560 --> 20:58.720
 extent they are. I've been pretty hard on the FDA, but maybe the issue is a higher level issue.

20:58.720 --> 21:04.000
 Like the Inveacher Diagnostics Division is they get applications and they evaluate them. And the

21:04.000 --> 21:09.680
 applications are for medical claims. That's, however, because there's been a misunderstanding

21:09.680 --> 21:16.560
 of these tests and the companies only know to apply for these as medical claims because there is no,

21:17.120 --> 21:23.920
 there's nothing else in this country to apply for except a medical claim. So we don't have a public

21:23.920 --> 21:30.000
 health pathway to evaluate a test and authorize a test. It doesn't exist. We have defunded and

21:30.000 --> 21:35.280
 devalued public health for so long that we literally don't have a language for it. We don't

21:35.280 --> 21:40.960
 have laws, a language, words. Is it called a public health test? Is it called something else?

21:40.960 --> 21:45.760
 I call it a public health test because I'm trying to create a new definition here.

21:46.480 --> 21:53.040
 But that's why nobody's acted because everyone says, well, there's no other pathway. So the FDA

21:53.040 --> 21:58.080
 Invitro Medical Diagnostics Division is the only pathway. So what I am trying to do

21:58.080 --> 22:08.720
 is to say, look, the FDA very clearly states that they do not authorize or review public health

22:08.720 --> 22:18.000
 tools and they don't authorize or review public health tests for COVID. So what I want the president

22:18.000 --> 22:24.880
 of the United States to do is to utilize executive powers and take an executive action that can

22:24.880 --> 22:32.640
 simply state one line. One line could potentially change all of this. And it's a pretty obvious

22:32.640 --> 22:40.720
 and simple line. And it is that any tools used for public health testing during this public

22:40.720 --> 22:48.160
 health emergency will be designated as public health tools. It's obvious. It's public health

22:48.160 --> 22:52.160
 emergency. It's a tool used for public health that should be designated as a public health tool.

22:52.160 --> 22:59.200
 If we can do that, if we can get that language out there so that that's the president's decision,

22:59.920 --> 23:06.240
 then all of a sudden the FDA is off the hook. They're not trying to cram a square peg through a

23:06.240 --> 23:12.720
 round hole. They can say, look, the antigen tests are not on us anymore, at least if they're going

23:12.720 --> 23:19.040
 to be used for public health, like when you test a thousand people at a time or test a school

23:19.040 --> 23:24.400
 classroom if they've been exposed, this is public health. And so then the CDC could take it over.

23:25.040 --> 23:30.880
 The CDC could say, okay, what are the metrics we are interested in? And they could say,

23:30.880 --> 23:34.800
 we're interested in a test that can catch you if you're infectious. So you want high viral

23:34.800 --> 23:41.040
 load detection. That's fast. That's scalable. And hey, if your test has been used in Europe for

23:41.040 --> 23:48.000
 months and has performed extremely well, then we'll give you a certificate by right immediately.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.840
 And that could actually get hundreds of millions of additional tests into the United States tomorrow.

23:55.040 --> 23:59.440
 So you need some kind of classification from an FDA or from somebody to call it a public

23:59.440 --> 24:04.480
 health tool in order for it to be manufactured? Is it possible to just go around all of this

24:04.480 --> 24:12.160
 and just for somebody to manufacture at scale tests? Well, if you did that and you just called

24:12.160 --> 24:18.400
 them, you put a claim on them that called them public health tools, the FDA has a very

24:19.200 --> 24:23.040
 weird view of this. And they will tell you that it's illegal, that it's a crime.

24:24.800 --> 24:29.200
 Is there a way to say like Elon Musk did with the flamethrower? It's not a flamethrower.

24:31.600 --> 24:35.120
 Believe me, I've tried to think of all the different approaches.

24:36.240 --> 24:40.400
 You know, there's weird, there's like, there's major inconsistencies here. So it's not like

24:40.400 --> 24:43.760
 we don't have a precedent for a public health test even during this pandemic.

24:44.800 --> 24:50.880
 There is a very strong precedent pooled testing. We have companies like Ginkgo,

24:50.880 --> 24:57.280
 right, based out here in Cambridge, that are, you know, working with 100 different labs around

24:57.280 --> 25:00.960
 the country. So that might mean like not a ton of quality control over those labs

25:02.000 --> 25:06.320
 doing. I mean, I don't want to say that they don't. I'm just saying the reality is if you're

25:06.320 --> 25:11.920
 working with that many labs, it's hard to say. They're running pooled testing of millions and

25:11.920 --> 25:20.480
 millions and millions of kids. So here you have a company that's testing in each pool five to

25:20.480 --> 25:26.480
 25 kids at a time, millions of kids in a pretty distributed way across the country in all these

25:26.480 --> 25:33.040
 different labs. And the FDA doesn't care at all. You don't need an EUA. It doesn't need a regulatory

25:33.040 --> 25:39.040
 authority. It's collection on site. It's getting shipped to a lab. There's no oversight of it.

25:40.160 --> 25:45.520
 So why does that have no oversight but a rapid test for the exact same purpose?

25:46.320 --> 25:51.280
 You're just giving people immediate results instead of two day delayed pooled PCR results.

25:51.280 --> 25:56.880
 So it's a much more effective tool. Why is the rapid test used for the same purpose,

25:56.880 --> 26:04.000
 not designated as a public health tool, but requiring FDA authorization? It's a ridiculous

26:04.000 --> 26:11.440
 reason. And it's because the FDA says that if a test, and this is actually CMS that says this

26:11.440 --> 26:19.680
 in the FDA adopts it, if a test alters your behavior, if you get a single result and it's

26:19.680 --> 26:27.280
 going to alter your behavior, then that is a medical device. But the thing that I find

26:27.280 --> 26:32.800
 ridiculous is like, okay, but you can give a pooled test that alters 25 people's behavior at once.

26:33.840 --> 26:38.800
 And that's not falling like that's more risky. One person turns positive in the pool and 25

26:38.800 --> 26:45.840
 people have to be quarantined. And how do they evaluate the accuracy? So for people who don't

26:45.840 --> 26:53.680
 know a pooled test is you're testing a small fraction of the people. And if one of them is

26:53.680 --> 26:58.560
 positive, then you basically say, we have to retest everybody in the pool. Or like you.

26:58.560 --> 27:03.440
 Yeah. So you take, let's say you have a school and each classroom, you might have 20 kids each

27:03.440 --> 27:09.120
 swab their nose in a classroom. And all those swabs go into a single tube. And then you rinse that

27:09.120 --> 27:15.040
 tube out with some saline and you run a PCR test on that tube of 25 samples or 20 samples.

27:15.040 --> 27:22.080
 And so if that tube turns positive in the PCR test, then all 20 or 25 of those students

27:23.120 --> 27:29.120
 are now having to quarantine. And if there's no positive, then all 20 or 25 students are

27:30.080 --> 27:37.840
 interpreting that their result is negative. So it really is a ridiculous decision by the FDA to

27:37.840 --> 27:43.920
 say that if the test itself only tests one sample at a time, it's medicine because it will tell

27:43.920 --> 27:48.880
 one person at a time if you're positive or if you're negative. But if you do it as a pool and you

27:50.320 --> 27:56.080
 tell 25 people that your pool was negative, then that's somehow different. That's public

27:56.080 --> 28:00.880
 health, not medicine. It doesn't make, there's no logic there. Was it just personalities and

28:00.880 --> 28:06.720
 accidents of history or something like that? For example, you talk about the public health tools

28:06.720 --> 28:12.880
 and CDC, you look at masks. So masks were decided to somehow be an effective tool

28:12.880 --> 28:21.120
 to help with the pandemic. So I'm sure the evidence that was used there was probably not as strong

28:21.120 --> 28:27.440
 as the evidence supporting antigen rapid tests. I was very much reading a lot of research on masks.

28:27.440 --> 28:32.480
 It's tricky. It's really tricky to show how well they stopped the transmission of a virus,

28:32.480 --> 28:37.360
 especially when you don't fully understand how the virus is transmitted or the viral load required,

28:37.360 --> 28:42.000
 all that kind of stuff. But then the CDC pretty quickly decided masks or whatever,

28:42.000 --> 28:47.360
 there's some oscillations back and forth. But then they quickly decided, all everybody decided

28:47.360 --> 28:53.840
 masks is a good tool. So masks being decided a good tool and then rapid antigen tests,

28:53.840 --> 28:58.960
 not a good tool. Is that just like certain personalities who didn't speak up in a meeting

28:58.960 --> 29:03.120
 or who did speak up in a meeting? Is it just like a weird roll of the dice or is there a

29:03.120 --> 29:09.840
 better explanation? I think it's somewhat of a roll of the dice, but I also think it's that testing.

29:09.840 --> 29:20.880
 So doctors don't pretend to really understand much about fluid dynamics and how well masks

29:20.880 --> 29:27.840
 are working. That's way out of their realm. Doctors do believe that they understand all

29:27.840 --> 29:38.960
 aspects of the tests. And so the greatest barriers to rapid tests being brought to market or being

29:38.960 --> 29:46.320
 rolled out heavily and supported as public health tools, the greatest barriers came from physicians

29:46.320 --> 29:54.960
 saying, hell no, we can't use a test that's not as sensitive as a PCR. And look at what happens

29:54.960 --> 30:01.120
 if you use this antigen test and not a PCR test, you get people who are showing a positive on a

30:01.120 --> 30:09.040
 PCR negative on an antigen. And they just assume that that was a false negative on the antigen. For

30:09.040 --> 30:14.880
 public health, I would call it a false positive on the PCR test. But this type of thinking

30:16.160 --> 30:20.640
 literally does not exist in medicine. And I think the biggest problem here is that we

30:21.440 --> 30:29.600
 placed physicians in decision making power. We have, when this pandemic hit, everyone called up

30:29.600 --> 30:35.520
 clinical laboratory folks and microbiologists and physicians to ask, well, what kind of test

30:35.520 --> 30:42.080
 should we use that kind of thing? And there is no training in medical school for this kind of

30:42.080 --> 30:48.720
 public health work. Like you have to optimize on the right qualities of a test that have nothing

30:48.720 --> 30:54.960
 to do with medicine. And then sometimes, if not frequently, they're actually at odds. And I'll

30:54.960 --> 31:00.480
 give an example why the physicians, you could see why the physicians would have been against it from

31:00.480 --> 31:09.760
 their perspective. And they say, if a physician is a TSA agent at the airport, a TSA agent,

31:09.760 --> 31:15.360
 their role at any given time, and the role they think that the instruments need to play is,

31:15.360 --> 31:20.240
 I want you to scan the bag as well as possible. This is the only bag that I'm interested in at

31:20.240 --> 31:27.280
 the moment. And this is my lane. This is my bag. I want to make sure that my instrument's doing.

31:27.280 --> 31:31.280
 I don't want the crappy instrument in my lane. I want to make sure that I'm doing everything I can.

31:31.280 --> 31:37.360
 But what those TSA agents don't have to worry about is, well, how many other instruments are

31:37.360 --> 31:42.240
 there in this airport? Is anyone getting through the lines here without going through security?

31:42.240 --> 31:46.000
 The average TSA agent doesn't have to worry about that. They literally have one job to do.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.760
 And it's pay attention to this lane. If there's a big gap in the security line and people are

31:51.760 --> 31:56.560
 flowing through without going through security, that's not on the TSA agent. That's not a big

31:56.560 --> 32:04.640
 systematic problem of the system. And we can't expect that TSA agent to have ever even thought

32:04.640 --> 32:10.720
 about that. That's not on them. They were trained to look at the bag. And that's like physicians.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.880
 And I, you know, probably some physicians will hear this and feel like I'm insulting it. I don't

32:14.880 --> 32:19.840
 mean to be likening, you know, the two professions and or anything like that. What the point is,

32:19.840 --> 32:27.680
 is that a physician has one duty, do no harm to this patient. Time is an of the essence, scale

32:27.680 --> 32:34.240
 how many tests can my hospital perform in a day? How many tests can my county or country perform

32:34.240 --> 32:41.440
 in a day? That's not a physician's training to think like that at all. And so what has happened

32:41.440 --> 32:46.480
 is doctors got on board early and said, oh, hell no, we've seen these antigen tests before. They're

32:46.480 --> 32:51.440
 not particularly sensitive compared to PCR. And early in the pandemic, there was like pissing

32:51.440 --> 32:59.040
 matches between labs who had the most sensitive PCR. And it just distracted everything. It really,

32:59.040 --> 33:05.120
 I was trying to say pretty early, like, we don't need sensitivity. We just need frequency. We just

33:05.120 --> 33:10.400
 need scale. We need to think differently because our only goal if we're doing frequent routine

33:10.400 --> 33:15.600
 testing of asymptomatic people is not medicine. It's to say, do you need to isolate now? And if

33:15.600 --> 33:20.880
 you have a PCR test, that's taking three days to return. And you're like, if I was currently

33:20.880 --> 33:26.080
 spreading virus before I walked in here, and you handed me, this actually happened to me today

33:26.080 --> 33:30.960
 when I walked into Harvard. Today was my first day back into Harvard since February of 2020.

33:30.960 --> 33:39.600
 I go in, I scan my badge, and they hand me a PCR tube. And they say, return this by noon or

33:39.600 --> 33:45.280
 something before your work day is done. And I'm looking at it, I'm like, what is this going to

33:45.280 --> 33:50.800
 do? What if I'm super spreader right now? You're giving me free reign to walk around, and in fact,

33:50.800 --> 33:55.280
 everyone in the school, and you're going to give me my result to tell me I did it.

33:55.280 --> 34:00.000
 The result to tell me I did that in two days from now, it doesn't really make sense.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.280
 So who is supposed to be, so it's understandable that doctors kind of feel that way. Just like you

34:05.280 --> 34:13.440
 said, do no harm. Who is supposed to care about public health? Is it the FDA? Is there some other

34:13.440 --> 34:20.000
 organization yet to be created? Is it like, just like with the military, the reason we have civilian

34:20.000 --> 34:26.880
 leadership when you talk about war, is it the president that's supposed to do override FDA,

34:26.880 --> 34:32.320
 override doctors, override, and basically politicians in representing the people in the

34:32.320 --> 34:38.720
 state of emergency make big public health decisions? Who is supposed to do it besides you on Twitter?

34:39.760 --> 34:46.080
 It's like, most people really thinking about solutions to COVID will mention you or will

34:46.080 --> 34:54.480
 mention this idea of rapid at home testing, and you watch that happening, this discussion that

34:54.480 --> 34:59.440
 this is an obvious part of the solution, and the solution is not happening. So who is supposed to

34:59.440 --> 35:06.160
 implement this idea? I think the CDC that it should start there. Override the FDA? Well,

35:06.160 --> 35:09.680
 I don't even think it needs to override it. And that's why I think these should just be

35:09.680 --> 35:16.400
 designated as a different tool so that the companies, it's not overriding. It's just saying, look, this

35:16.400 --> 35:21.600
 isn't even, this isn't in your jurisdiction to the FDA. This is just a public health tool. But

35:21.600 --> 35:27.920
 the problem is the Centers for Medicaid Medicare Services designates any tool just like FDA,

35:27.920 --> 35:32.640
 they designate these as medical devices purely because they could change somebody's behavior

35:32.640 --> 35:39.360
 based on the result of one test. So to change that at this point, unless you can get CMS buy in,

35:39.360 --> 35:46.240
 you know, we don't have, there is no designation as a public health tool. But the president can just

35:46.240 --> 35:53.520
 say, these are public health tools. These are not to be regulated as medical devices if their goal

35:53.520 --> 35:59.120
 is not medicine, but public health. And if he does it, he does have the authority to do that as

35:59.120 --> 36:07.360
 president and to say, I'm asking the CDC to certify these tests or authorize them for use in the

36:07.360 --> 36:12.480
 United States. And, you know, he has to say something like that. He can't come out and say, these are

36:12.480 --> 36:18.320
 public health tools have free reign. Just, you know, any companies start, start shipping them in

36:18.320 --> 36:24.080
 the U.S. because that would create pandemonia and we'd have a lot of bad tests. But there's a lot of

36:24.080 --> 36:30.320
 really good tests out there. We just are taking like six to 12 months to run trials. They're

36:30.320 --> 36:37.120
 failing because they can't keep up with PCR. And if the president were to do this, then the CDC

36:37.120 --> 36:43.040
 could take it over and they could say, okay, it's on us. We're going to decide, the UK actually did

36:43.040 --> 36:49.040
 this. They, early on, they said, okay, they laid out a very clear regimen. They said, this is how

36:49.040 --> 36:55.520
 we are going to evaluate rapid antigen tests because they're public health tools. They did it in a,

36:55.520 --> 37:00.960
 in a domain that was outside of their normal medical diagnostic regulatory agencies. And they,

37:00.960 --> 37:07.360
 they literally just had very fast screening to say, what are the best tests? They went through

37:07.920 --> 37:11.520
 a huge number of different tests and they said, okay, these are the, this is the rank order of

37:11.520 --> 37:17.280
 which tests are good, which are bad, which are scalable, which are not. And they were able to

37:17.280 --> 37:22.800
 start deploying them in weeks, not years. So I think the CDC really needs to take charge. The

37:22.800 --> 37:30.160
 problem is when it comes to like law, if everyone currently perceives this as like fully within the

37:30.160 --> 37:37.680
 domain of the FDA, and they've never heard of such a public health test idea enabling, but the FDA

37:37.680 --> 37:43.760
 itself has created the idea by saying, we don't regulate public health tools. So the word is out

37:43.760 --> 37:49.760
 there. The FDA has said, we don't regulate them. So that gives the president an opportunity to say,

37:49.760 --> 37:56.640
 okay, these are those, you know, these are public health tools by definition. And, and I do think

37:56.640 --> 38:00.960
 that this is a kind of a crisis. And it's a crisis of testing, but it's also a crisis of like,

38:01.760 --> 38:04.800
 really, we're going to go through this whole pandemic and never figure this thing out.

38:05.520 --> 38:11.200
 That's just really sad. And if we get through this and don't figure out how to evaluate a damn

38:11.200 --> 38:20.000
 rapid test. So how do vaccines play with this? So one of the things that when people discuss

38:20.000 --> 38:27.120
 solutions to COVID, there's a sense that once you have a vaccine, COVID is solved. So how does that

38:27.120 --> 38:33.600
 interplay? Like, why do we still need tests if we have vaccines? Yeah, I am. I actually wrote an

38:33.600 --> 38:39.600
 op ed in New York Times or Wall Street Journal or something that was titled, Why We Still Need

38:39.600 --> 38:48.400
 Rapid Test With Vaccines. And the real reason is because we have evaluated our vaccines based

38:48.400 --> 38:53.600
 on their ability to stop disease. In fact, most of the trials didn't evaluate them based on their

38:53.600 --> 39:00.000
 ability to stop transmission. They didn't even evaluate that at all, no less put it as one of

39:00.000 --> 39:07.280
 the metrics for authorization. And with a virus like this, it would be a bit naive to think that

39:07.280 --> 39:14.720
 it's really going to stop transmission well. I think a lot of excitement happened right after

39:14.720 --> 39:19.280
 the first clinical trials. And I'm sure we were talking about it when I was last year, I would

39:19.280 --> 39:25.040
 imagine, given the timing. But those first clinical trials came out and everyone jumped for joy that

39:25.040 --> 39:30.480
 these things were going to be the end to this pandemic. But we had really short sighted vision

39:30.480 --> 39:37.280
 there by not recognizing two main features. One is that they might not stop transmission.

39:38.160 --> 39:42.720
 Another, I guess three, another is that new variants might come around that will break

39:42.720 --> 39:50.560
 through the vaccine protective immunity. And the third is that we were measuring the efficacy of

39:50.560 --> 39:55.840
 these vaccines during the peak of their performance in the first few months after people got vaccinated.

39:56.640 --> 40:01.040
 And that gives a skewed view of just how effective these are going to be long term. So what happened

40:01.760 --> 40:06.960
 with the vaccines is that everyone got very comfortable, including the CDC saying,

40:06.960 --> 40:13.520
 if you've been vaccinated, this is the end of the pandemic for you. And let's keep it up. But then

40:13.520 --> 40:18.480
 Delta comes along, and waning immunity comes along. And both of these things compound exactly

40:18.480 --> 40:26.080
 as anticipated to get breakthrough cases. And unfortunately, what we're seeing now is the CDC

40:26.080 --> 40:32.880
 and the administration went so all in on saying that breakthrough cases are rare, that transmission

40:32.880 --> 40:37.440
 doesn't really happen if you're vaccinated without great data, especially with Delta,

40:38.080 --> 40:44.000
 that once people started seeing breakthrough cases, they started interpreting that as a

40:44.000 --> 40:47.680
 failure of the vaccine. The vaccines are still working to keep people out of the hospital

40:48.400 --> 40:55.600
 for the most part. But they're not working to stop transmission. And if our goal is to stop

40:55.600 --> 41:00.960
 transmission, which until we decide as a society that we have different goals,

41:00.960 --> 41:06.400
 like we're okay with people getting ill and letting transmission go because we don't want to worry

41:06.400 --> 41:10.720
 about it anymore, we're not there yet. So until we decide we're not going to stop transmission,

41:10.720 --> 41:17.200
 we need other avenues besides the vaccine because it's not doing it. It also means that herd immunity

41:17.200 --> 41:22.480
 isn't going to happen. And unfortunately, as long as we keep letting spread happen in the context

41:22.480 --> 41:28.720
 of vaccinated people, we're kind of giving this virus a boot camp of exactly what it needs to

41:28.720 --> 41:35.280
 do and mutate to get around our vaccine derived antibodies. And that makes me very nervous. So

41:35.280 --> 41:41.040
 the more we can do to stop spread in the unvaccinated, in the elderly vaccinated and in

41:41.040 --> 41:46.400
 other people, the better. We just should be focusing on that.

41:46.400 --> 41:51.520
 So in your eyes, the solution would look like this. You would make enough tests where every

41:51.520 --> 41:57.280
 single person will get tested every single day? I think that that would be, I don't want to do

41:57.280 --> 42:01.920
 that actually. I want to do a variation on that. I think what we should do is have a

42:01.920 --> 42:10.160
 dynamical testing program. It doesn't have to be complicated. It's every household has a box

42:10.160 --> 42:16.080
 of tests and they're covered. And if you haven't seen any cases in your community for a long time,

42:16.080 --> 42:20.800
 stop testing. Do wastewater testing to see if there's any RNA coming back.

42:22.080 --> 42:26.000
 If you start to see RNA in the wastewater that represents the virus and you're still wanting

42:26.000 --> 42:31.440
 to stop outbreaks, you say, hey, you know, those tests that are in your cupboards, households in

42:31.440 --> 42:36.400
 this county, what is in each household or each person in each household use one test per week?

42:37.440 --> 42:44.560
 And can you, sorry to just pause on that idea. That's really cool. The wastewater testing,

42:44.560 --> 42:49.840
 that's the thing. So you can get a sense of how prevalent the virus is in a particular

42:49.840 --> 42:56.720
 community by testing the wastewater. That's exactly right. And so the viral load associated, the viral

42:56.720 --> 43:02.960
 load that you can find in the community represents the prevalence of the virus in the community,

43:02.960 --> 43:10.400
 which is really quite nice. That's a nice way to paint like a map of the intensity of the virus.

43:12.400 --> 43:19.360
 When it goes above a certain level, you can start doing much higher frequency testing perhaps

43:19.360 --> 43:23.920
 in each household. That's right. So I don't want people to be in testing purgatory. Like,

43:23.920 --> 43:29.760
 that's not what I want. I just want us to get through this pandemic. And so we can monitor

43:29.760 --> 43:34.960
 the wastewater or any other methods. We can monitor the hospitals and the clinics. And

43:34.960 --> 43:38.800
 if somebody does come in with COVID like symptoms and then a few other people come in, you realize,

43:38.800 --> 43:44.240
 okay, we got spread happening in our community. Send out a text message, put it on the news,

43:44.240 --> 43:49.840
 put in the newspaper, whatever you need to do, tell people, tell families, use your test. And if

43:49.840 --> 43:54.640
 the cases get worse, because you're just doing it once a week, that's not going to stop transmission,

43:54.640 --> 44:00.640
 but it's going to enable you to identify where outbreaks are happening. If you start to find

44:00.640 --> 44:06.000
 outbreaks in pockets, then the rule is simply, okay, let's squash the outbreak real fast. So

44:06.000 --> 44:10.560
 everyone in that area and certain zip code or whatever it might be, test every two days,

44:10.560 --> 44:17.440
 you know, for seven days, or every day for seven days, and you'll get rid of the outbreak. We can

44:17.440 --> 44:24.640
 do that. And if you've now gone again, you know, a week or two with no cases identified, stopped

44:24.640 --> 44:30.160
 testing again. That's the nice thing that everything changes when people have the test in their home.

44:30.720 --> 44:37.120
 It becomes dynamic. It can become easy. Send a text message, take your test today. If some people

44:37.120 --> 44:42.880
 don't do it, that's fine. The only goal is to get R below one and you stop the outbreak.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.960
 People think it has to be near perfect. I always hear people say,

44:48.080 --> 44:54.240
 oh, what if somebody doesn't use it? Or what if somebody lies? Well, you have 98% of people

44:54.240 --> 44:59.920
 testing, or even 50%, that's a whole lot better. And, you know, another big difference that people,

44:59.920 --> 45:05.440
 I think, oftentimes have a problem wrapping their head around, especially to an extent,

45:05.440 --> 45:10.800
 and physicians who are used to really, like who are used to different kinds of metrics is that

45:12.000 --> 45:17.840
 all we have to do to completely stop an outbreak from spreading in a community is to get, for every

45:17.840 --> 45:25.520
 hundred infected people, to get them to go on an infect 95. Most people would say, oh my god,

45:25.520 --> 45:30.160
 that's a horrible, you know, that's a horrible program. You're still letting 100 people go and

45:30.160 --> 45:37.840
 infect 95 people. But for a virus like this, that's a massive public health win. If you can get 100

45:37.840 --> 45:42.640
 people to infect 90, most people, doctors, I would say, like a lot of people would say that

45:42.640 --> 45:48.960
 sounds like a failure, to be honest. But if you do that for multiple days in a row, then in a

45:48.960 --> 45:53.920
 couple of weeks, you've gone from a big outbreak to a very, very small outbreak. And on the other

45:53.920 --> 45:59.520
 hand, if you don't do that, if you allow 100 people to just infect 140 people, because you're

45:59.520 --> 46:04.880
 not doing the testing, then instead of having 20 people at the end of those four weeks with the

46:04.880 --> 46:11.680
 testing, you literally would have 600. There's massive differences here. And all the only goal

46:11.680 --> 46:16.640
 then is to get R below one, have 100 people infect less than 100, and you stop the outbreaks and

46:16.640 --> 46:21.840
 everyone stays safe. From everything you've seen, how cheap can these things get from like in the

46:21.840 --> 46:27.360
 past year, in terms of the developments you've seen with the various test manufacturers, how

46:27.360 --> 46:30.720
 cheap can it be to make a test, to manufacture a test?

46:30.720 --> 46:36.880
 So there's the manufacturing process. That could be 50 cents, maybe less. It's hard to get,

46:36.880 --> 46:40.640
 it's hard to really have eyeballs inside these companies in terms of where they're producing

46:40.640 --> 46:46.640
 them in China and Taiwan, a number of other places. Some of them are produced here in the

46:46.640 --> 46:51.680
 United States too, but 50 cents, say, is a very, very reasonable, generous number for how much it

46:51.680 --> 46:57.600
 costs per test. You look at a place with high market competition that has actually authorized

46:57.600 --> 47:03.120
 a lot of these tests, like Germany. Germany has 60, 70, some different companies of high quality

47:03.120 --> 47:09.120
 rapid tests authorized. You can go there and buy it for 80 cents. That's, and they're still making

47:09.120 --> 47:17.600
 profit. So it's extremely cheap. Market competition can drive these tests way down in terms of cost.

47:17.600 --> 47:24.400
 I think one of the most important features of a rapid test program is what do you do with the

47:24.400 --> 47:31.680
 result? Is it going to be used for you to gain entry to school or work? Is it going to be reported

47:31.680 --> 47:37.600
 to the public health agencies? All of these, the primary mode should be just get people test,

47:37.600 --> 47:41.280
 but really if you're going to be using it for a workplace thing, like what Biden is now saying,

47:41.280 --> 47:45.760
 vaccinator test, which is going to lead to a crisis if we don't fix this soon because we're

47:45.760 --> 47:51.200
 going to massive demand for testing in the next couple of weeks. But when he says that, that's

47:51.200 --> 47:55.920
 essentially saying, okay, companies need to make sure that their people are testing. So are you

47:55.920 --> 48:02.560
 going to base it on the honor system? I would say you probably would not base testing on the honor

48:02.560 --> 48:08.560
 system if it's like to take somebody who would otherwise be quarantined from in school. And so

48:08.560 --> 48:12.960
 you can go to school as long as your test is negative. So test to stay program is a big thing

48:12.960 --> 48:18.880
 that I've been pushing for and others have businesses bringing people into work who need to

48:18.880 --> 48:24.240
 test. They need to have verification, but they don't want to like set up nursing stations in

48:24.240 --> 48:28.720
 their lobbies or in the school parking lot or whatever, like everyone's tired of that. We need

48:28.720 --> 48:34.880
 to bring the test into the home, but that means we need the technology to enable it. And so I was

48:34.880 --> 48:40.960
 at a conference recently, do you know Mike Milken? Milken Institute, he's a very wealthy

48:40.960 --> 48:45.520
 billionaire, but he's done a lot of philanthropy and he hosts a conference to raise money for

48:45.520 --> 48:51.040
 prostate cancer research. I was at this conference recently, Francis Collins and a number of other

48:51.040 --> 48:57.600
 people were there. And every morning, we all had to test in the morning, which I thought was a

48:57.600 --> 49:04.480
 great idea, obviously, before we walked into that conference. But you didn't have to test there. And

49:04.480 --> 49:09.680
 they didn't base it on the honor system. Every morning, I scanned a QR code, I scanned a QR

49:09.680 --> 49:17.360
 code on the box and eMed, which is a service that provides test verification, popped up with a

49:17.360 --> 49:23.840
 proctor right on my phone or on my computer and said, okay, let's go through your tests. And they

49:23.840 --> 49:28.560
 watch you, they videotape you using the test. So it's all recorded. It's all a reportable type of

49:28.560 --> 49:35.120
 test. And at the end of it, just from your home, you don't actually see the proctor, but they're

49:35.120 --> 49:40.720
 just verifying that you actually do it. They verify the test, they verify the test results with you.

49:41.600 --> 49:47.040
 And at the end of it, you've then gotten from your couch or from your car, wherever you are,

49:47.040 --> 49:53.840
 an actual verified laboratory report that can be considered proof that you yourself use the test

49:53.840 --> 49:59.680
 and you yourself got a negative. So the tools are out here, if we want to use them at scale. And

49:59.680 --> 50:06.640
 in fact, the CDC uses eMed now to enable people to come back into the United States through an

50:06.640 --> 50:10.240
 antigen test. So before you get on your flight, you're sitting in the airport in Heathrow or

50:10.240 --> 50:16.480
 wherever you are, you can get on your computer, use your eMed test, and you get the negative and

50:16.480 --> 50:21.040
 that and CDC will accept that TSA will accept you to come back into the US with a rapid antigen

50:21.040 --> 50:25.600
 test that you did without anyone else watching, except for this proctor on your phone. Super

50:25.600 --> 50:31.600
 simple. How much private information is being collected? So like this, you know, people have

50:32.480 --> 50:38.640
 in the United States, the American way they have a hesitancy on the overreach of government

50:39.520 --> 50:48.320
 in things like vaccine passports, like using any mechanism, any mechanism of verification

50:48.320 --> 50:54.400
 that's controlled by government can lead to overreach by said government. So there's a concern

50:54.400 --> 51:01.920
 of that. Do you see there a way of achieving testing that's verified, but does not violate

51:01.920 --> 51:09.920
 people's privacy or sense of freedom? Absolutely. I think so. The way that right now in the United

51:09.920 --> 51:16.640
 States, they're requesting that these tests get that the results get delivered to public health

51:16.640 --> 51:22.960
 agencies. But I've long held that while that's ideal, it should never be the thing that holds

51:22.960 --> 51:29.920
 up somebody being allowed to know their own status. But if you are going to work and you have to let

51:29.920 --> 51:34.400
 your boss or your manager, whomever know that you were negative that day, or if you're going to

51:34.400 --> 51:43.200
 school, I think it's going to be hard to maintain complete privacy in that situation because they

51:43.200 --> 51:48.960
 need to know your name. But sure, I mean, could you cut off the public health reporting? Yes,

51:48.960 --> 51:54.480
 you could. But I worry, I mean, can you opt out? Maybe you could opt out. That should be a feature.

51:54.480 --> 52:00.640
 I want to opt out of the public health reporting because for whatever reason, otherwise, I'm not

52:00.640 --> 52:04.880
 going to do the test. But that means that, okay, then you're not going to go to work. So right now,

52:04.880 --> 52:10.960
 there's this serious tension. And I am very uncomfortable with the idea that we force anyone

52:10.960 --> 52:17.120
 to do anything. But there is a tension between these two things for sure. And how do you balance

52:17.120 --> 52:23.600
 that during a public health emergency? I think first and foremost, let people, everyone has a

52:23.600 --> 52:29.280
 right to know their status. The fact that we have made it hard for people to know their status on

52:29.280 --> 52:39.760
 their terms, I think is a travesty. I mean, it's just so terrible that we have prioritized us knowing

52:39.760 --> 52:43.680
 at the expense of you. Essentially, what public health has long said during this pandemic is,

52:43.680 --> 52:50.880
 if I'm public health, if I can't know, then you can't know your status. That's not the right way

52:50.880 --> 52:55.920
 to look at public health. We need to engage the public. And if some of them don't want to participate

52:55.920 --> 53:01.680
 in the public health part but want to know their status, by default, they are participating in

53:01.680 --> 53:04.720
 public health, whether they know it or not, because they're not going to go get their mom

53:04.720 --> 53:10.320
 sick by mistake. At least most people wouldn't. And then also, you can create systems where

53:10.320 --> 53:19.440
 you can, individuals can form relationships based on their status without ever reporting it

53:19.440 --> 53:27.520
 to a centralized place. So you can go to, I don't know, a local business owner might require that

53:27.520 --> 53:35.840
 you show that you're negative. But that doesn't require reporting it. There might be basically

53:35.840 --> 53:42.480
 like an ID that's only in possession. You are the only person in possession of that. So you

53:42.480 --> 53:48.080
 literally show it. Here's a test I took, it's negative. And nobody else knows about that test.

53:48.080 --> 53:53.840
 So that could very well be done, even through a company like EMAID. I think, and I might be wrong

53:53.840 --> 54:00.320
 here, I believe that they take the test result. And because they are considered a clear waived

54:00.320 --> 54:07.120
 laboratory, like a digital laboratory, they report their results by law out to the public

54:07.120 --> 54:11.360
 health agencies. But let's say there was something a little different. Let's say you are verifying

54:11.360 --> 54:15.520
 an over the counter test. And it doesn't have to be a clear wave because it's over the counter.

54:15.520 --> 54:21.440
 Then you're not bound by clear rules. And you could create the same service, but that just

54:21.440 --> 54:26.800
 doesn't report out to the public health agencies. It gives people the option to opt in or out of

54:26.800 --> 54:34.720
 public health reporting. And I know that public health people get a little queasy when I talk about

54:34.720 --> 54:40.240
 this. But as a public health person myself, like, yes, of course, I would prefer that the data be

54:40.240 --> 54:45.440
 available to evaluate to know where the cases are. But first and foremost, I want to make sure that

54:45.440 --> 54:52.640
 the people using the test are going to use the test. And if that means that they're not reporting,

54:52.640 --> 54:56.320
 and that that's the only way that they will use it is if it's not reported, then that's better

54:56.320 --> 55:05.120
 than no test. Especially given that the central to the vaccine hesitancy is a distrust of authority

55:05.120 --> 55:11.600
 and the distrust of government. So you're asking, you're asking people to get tested

55:12.640 --> 55:21.520
 and report their status to a centralized authority when they're clearly do not trust that authority.

55:21.520 --> 55:27.600
 It doesn't make any sense. It seems like a perfect solution to let people who are hesitant on the

55:27.600 --> 55:34.160
 vaccine to get their own status and have full control of that information and opt in, provide

55:34.160 --> 55:38.480
 that information if they wish to, but they have the full control of it and have the freedom to do

55:38.480 --> 55:43.680
 that information what they want. I fully agree with that. I really do. I think we can have the

55:43.680 --> 55:49.600
 verified services and we could have the privacy if you want. If you need to go into a restaurant

55:49.600 --> 55:54.640
 and there's a rule that you have to be a negative test, have it on your phone and only your phone.

55:54.640 --> 55:59.040
 And it's okay. Like email emails you the the lab report. You have it. You can say,

55:59.040 --> 56:04.400
 look, that's my name. I use it this morning. Negative. And in that case, you'd want something

56:04.400 --> 56:10.320
 that just is there and is not going anywhere else. And I think that those services, like I think they

56:10.320 --> 56:17.120
 can exist. And it's a struggle because for those companies, they don't want to fall out of favor

56:17.120 --> 56:24.320
 with the CDC or with the FDA. And so this is a big problem in our marketplace in general by having

56:26.240 --> 56:33.040
 private companies who want to be the public health agents of this pandemic.

56:33.840 --> 56:38.160
 We lose a lot of control because the companies ultimately have to do what's going to make them

56:38.160 --> 56:43.200
 money so they survive and keep performing the service. It's really just such a hard

56:43.200 --> 56:49.280
 problem. And this is why last time I was here, I'm guessing I was probably really pushing for the

56:49.280 --> 56:54.880
 government to be producing these tests. I think I would have still been pushing for that. You know,

56:54.880 --> 56:59.120
 at this point, I've decided, okay, government's clearly not going to do that. I've been thinking

56:59.120 --> 57:06.800
 I really want Elon Musk to produce the tests. Like, I really am sort of serious that these tests

57:06.800 --> 57:10.960
 are simple to make, but we've been using like machines to make them that have been around for a

57:10.960 --> 57:17.920
 long time. Scale is an issue right now kind of. Really, it's the EUA process and getting the

57:17.920 --> 57:22.080
 companies to be allowed to market in the US. That's the issue. But let's just say scale is the

57:22.080 --> 57:28.800
 issue and one company wants to make 20 million tests a day. These aren't that hard. We should

57:28.800 --> 57:33.040
 be able to do that. We just need a faster machine, a better machine and a quicker one.

57:33.040 --> 57:37.360
 And there's a few folks, like you mentioned, know how to solve that problem. I've had a lot of

57:37.360 --> 57:42.960
 discussion with Tesla folks and with people that used to work at Tesla like Jim Keller

57:42.960 --> 57:47.280
 about how to make stuff much cheaper, much better. That's basically what Tesla is world

57:47.280 --> 57:54.800
 class at. And it's like, okay, does this thing have to cost $1,000? No, it can cost $10.

57:54.800 --> 58:00.000
 Right. And let's figure out how to manufacture it. Those folks are like the best in the world

58:00.000 --> 58:09.680
 at doing that. Okay, but what about this Biden action plan? So it sounds like the guy agrees

58:09.680 --> 58:17.680
 with you, vaccinate or test. So I think given that choice, a lot of people go with test in America

58:17.680 --> 58:24.960
 because there's like a division it seems like. So what is this just politics? Is this just words

58:24.960 --> 58:29.200
 or do you think this is actually going to lead to something? And maybe can you explain what the

58:29.200 --> 58:37.200
 action plan is? So there's a number of pillars to the action plan. The two that I've been most

58:37.200 --> 58:41.120
 focused on, I mean, some of them are we want to get everyone vaccinated, all these things. And

58:41.920 --> 58:49.280
 one pillar is saying any company in the United States that has more than a hundred employees

58:51.440 --> 58:57.520
 is now required to ensure that any unvaccinated individuals in their workforce

58:57.520 --> 59:07.040
 test weekly. Another pillar is that the president is going to reduce the cost of PCR tests

59:08.320 --> 59:18.000
 by 35%, which is pretty moderate reduction, and is going to reduce the cost of antigen tests

59:18.000 --> 59:24.480
 and scale them up and make 280 million tests and put $2 billion into it.

59:24.480 --> 59:30.080
 So those are the two that I found most intriguing for the kind of mission that I've been on,

59:30.080 --> 59:34.800
 which is to just educate people around, hey, we have really, really powerful public health

59:34.800 --> 59:44.800
 tools we have yet to deploy. The issue at hand though is that now that the president has said

59:44.800 --> 59:51.600
 vaccinate or test, there's a problem inherent in that. It's essentially to coerce people around

59:51.600 --> 59:56.080
 vaccinated to get vaccinated because vaccinator test doesn't make sense when the vaccinated

59:56.080 --> 1:00:00.000
 people can transmit the virus just fine. It should be vaccinate and test.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:05.440
 Exactly. The problem that I have with that vaccinate or test idea is it's great if you

1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:11.280
 want to use it as a coercive effort to get people vaccinated. Like I'm not going to

1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:17.840
 wade into that argument. Do I agree with it or not? I'm just not going to even put my word under.

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:25.280
 I disagree with it. Let me say I disagree as opposed to doing great science communication,

1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:31.600
 this weird people talking down to the populace as if they're children trying to trick them.

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:39.920
 Here, have some candy. Everyone with common sense. Somebody told me I was having a conversation.

1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:43.120
 Like if the government is going to give you money to take the vaccine,

1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:49.680
 people that were already hesitant about the vaccine are not going to trust whatever the

1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:54.080
 heck you're doing. So don't trick people into taking the vaccine. Be honest and communicate

1:00:54.960 --> 1:01:01.040
 transparently everything that's known about the vaccine. Communicate the data. Inspire people with

1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:09.920
 transparency and like real communication of all the uncertainty around it and all the

1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:15.840
 difficult decisions of risk and all those kinds of things as opposed to trying to trick them like

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:23.280
 children into taking the vaccine anyway. Yes. Okay. Well, I didn't have to say this. There we go.

1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:29.200
 But you're saying it should not be like vaccinate or test. That tradeoff doesn't make sense.

1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:37.040
 Exactly. By saying vaccinate or test is absolutely confusing because it implies,

1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:40.880
 for anyone who's thinking about it, it is implying. And I've seen this because I have

1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:45.760
 business leaders call me Fortune 500 business leaders who call me and say, what do I do?

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:51.360
 Like I have 8,000 employees. Where am I going to get my tests? And a lot of people are saying

1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:55.920
 they're calling this a pandemic of the unvaccinated. These types of divisive,

1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:02.160
 this divisive language doesn't help. This isn't a pandemic of the unvaccinated. This is a pandemic

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:08.880
 of a fucking virus. Don't ever put it on the unvaccinated who frankly are just scared.

1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:14.320
 They don't know who to trust. And we haven't given them a lot of reason to trust public health to

1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:21.680
 be frank. So I agree. Now that you've opened the door, I'll just say my piece. Absolutely,

1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:28.080
 we need to be the most honest we can with all of this. This is confusing language to say

1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:35.520
 vaccine or test. We need to be very upfront and say, look, vaccines aren't stopping transmission

1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:40.400
 very well. Unfortunately, this is the world we have. We have Delta. We're going to have new

1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:48.560
 mutants. We have a vaccine that wanes somewhat over time. This is biology. I'm sorry. This is

1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:54.560
 just what it is. And then we say, but the vaccines are really protective for your personal health.

1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:57.760
 They're going to keep you out of the hospital. This is what you should care about as an

1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:04.000
 individual. And as a population, we need to figure out, okay, we have to stop transmission if that's

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.960
 our goal. So we should use the tools that are going to stop transmission if that's our goal

1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:14.240
 and saying vaccinate or test. If our goal is to actually stop transmission, that's confusing because

1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:19.920
 vaccines are not stopping it. There may be mildly lowering the risk of transmission.

1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:25.200
 So I'm just not a fan of that language. I think we should be being very, very clear,

1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:29.840
 like you said, and upfront about what are the limitations of the test, of the vaccine

1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:35.680
 and of the test. And we should be very clear that it can only help. The American public

1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:43.360
 in aggregate is extremely intelligent. They will figure out when you say that vaccine breakthrough

1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:48.640
 cases are rare, and then they start seeing story after story of whole parties of people

1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:53.440
 who are vaccinated have outbreaks. And everyone knows more people now who are having breakthrough

1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:58.080
 cases than they knew who had regular cases before the vaccine. People start to wonder,

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.120
 well, this is weird. They say that the vaccines are working and breakthrough cases are rare.

1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:07.680
 Maybe the whole vaccine program is failing entirely. And so it ends up shooting ourselves

1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:13.920
 in the foot if we try to create false expectations because we think it's going to be beneficial

1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:19.040
 for one thing when it's not for the other. And so to get back to the action plan,

1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:25.920
 sure, vaccinate or test, I think, and the increase in rapid tests,

1:04:25.920 --> 1:04:31.360
 I do think it was a bold move. I think it, I would say that it was the most prominent

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:37.600
 sort of display, encouraging display of the fact that rapid tests are indeed

1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:45.280
 effective public health tools. My real concern now with is that 280 million tests, that's like

1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:50.880
 less than one per person per year in the United States. So that's not the way that he said and

1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:55.200
 delivered it. And what most people think of when they hear the word 280 million, you don't usually

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:59.680
 put a lot of thought into what does that number mean? It sounds a big number. Most people are

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:04.160
 now going to be expecting that these tests are actually going to be staying in stock on the

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:10.880
 shelves at CVS and Walgreens and Amazon or whatever. So that's crisis number one is like,

1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:15.840
 now the expectation is set for having rapid tests, but they're not going to scale that well. We

1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:20.880
 won't have them. And then there's vaccinate or test. And that's going to bring millions and

1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:25.200
 millions of people who are not currently testing to have to start testing. So that's going to

1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:31.040
 overwhelm our PCR labs. And it's going to create five day delays again with PCR, if not longer,

1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:37.440
 because we'll have backlogs. And so the only real solution to this is to just scale up the tests

1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:42.000
 that are actually scalable. And that's the simple rapid test. And it's not even to scale them up

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:47.840
 through production and manufacturing here. It's to open the doors that the companies that already

1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:52.800
 exist here and can scale are allowed to do it. And to bring in the international market that some

1:05:52.800 --> 1:05:58.880
 of the biggest diagnostic companies in the world are not selling their millions and millions of

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:04.800
 tests in the billions of tests in the United States, because I don't want to play the game that

1:06:04.800 --> 1:06:10.960
 the FDA is currently requiring of them. So we have an opportunity. And I am very encouraged that

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:14.720
 the president actually did put these into the action plan. And I do want to say for the record

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:23.200
 that I'm supportive of it in principle. But I think now we actually are in a in like a

1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:27.200
 the timer has been set, and we have to deal with the crisis before it happens. Otherwise,

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:32.640
 there could be some real political points taken off. You know, I do worry that the president,

1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:36.480
 if he doesn't pull through with this and really make the tests available and we end up getting

1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:41.920
 into this other test crisis this fall, there could be political consequences to that. And the reason

1:06:41.920 --> 1:06:47.040
 is like these rapid tests are so personal, they become emotional almost. They're so they give

1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:52.000
 people that empowerment that I was talking about earlier. And when people can't get that,

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:57.840
 because the shelves are out of stock, they actually feel frustrated. And then that converts into like

1:06:57.840 --> 1:07:04.560
 anger, like in the blame. And so I do think that we have to be really smart about making a policy

1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:09.520
 like this and then ensuring that we can carry through with what the average American is actually

1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:16.560
 expecting. And speaking of politics, one of the great things about testing, maybe you can correct

1:07:16.560 --> 1:07:22.880
 me, but for my sense, it's one of the only solutions to COVID that has not yet been politicized.

1:07:22.880 --> 1:07:30.000
 So masks and vaccines, whether you like it or not, have been heavily politicized where there's

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:40.800
 literally a red, blue split on the use of those or like proud use, effective use of those tools.

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:46.560
 And it seems like everybody I talked to about testing, everybody's on board, red or blue.

1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:53.280
 Red or blue? They are, which is why I am particularly concerned about the vaccinate or test policy.

1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:56.640
 Right. Because all of a sudden, we just politicized it. We just

1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:03.280
 brought it with this thing that was fully bipartisan, really bipartisan. I mean, I've

1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:10.160
 talked to the fully, the really right side of Congress and the super liberal side of Congress,

1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:16.960
 the Senate, the same politicians, governors everywhere in this country have asked me for

1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:22.400
 support around these rapid tests because it just, you can have it reported or not. You can have it

1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:27.680
 in the home, in the privacy of your own home or not, or you do it at school. These tools are just

1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:33.600
 so powerful to identify infectious people. They didn't have to be politicized. They still don't.

1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:37.040
 I don't think that the action plan went so far that it's going to politicize them, but

1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:43.840
 I do think already it's starting to conjure up emotion saying, well, now I have to get tested.

1:08:43.840 --> 1:08:50.720
 The have to part, right. And that is where we go wrong. I have to get tested or vaccinated.

1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:59.520
 Screw that. I am independent, whatever. And I do worry that this thing that was purely

1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:04.000
 bipartisan, that we could have just scaled up months ago, people would have, we could have

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.040
 delivered it to every household, didn't even have to ask people to request to just delivered packages

1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:15.920
 to every home in America by now easily. If we were smart about it, we could have done it.

1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:20.960
 The most unpleasant thing about COVID is the uncertainty. And that's what leads to fear on

1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:30.400
 both the vaccine hesitant. It's the uncertainty about the vaccine and people who are have taken

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:36.160
 the vaccine, the uncertainty around like, am I in danger walking around? Can I go? Can I walk

1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:42.800
 down the hall like this fear of the world around you? And I think testing allows you to remove

1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:48.560
 a lot of that uncertainty. Like you gain back confidence that you can operate in this world

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:54.320
 and not get infected. And you become like a nicer person. I find myself every time I get tested,

1:09:54.320 --> 1:10:00.800
 become a nicer person to others because I know I'm not putting people in danger.

1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:07.760
 It's a heavy burden to carry to worry. Am I infectious? Like I was out last night,

1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:12.880
 but I do want to go see my mom today. Am I infectious? I don't know. And this has created

1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:23.360
 massive anxiety. I completely agree that it's a relieving feeling. And it's an amazing feeling

1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:28.560
 to be in a room. And I did this in the middle of the pandemic when everyone was supposed to be wearing

1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:35.440
 a mask indoors at everyone rapid tests. And I said, everyone should rapid test before you

1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:43.040
 walk into this room. And it was a wonderful experiment because everyone was just so relaxed.

1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:51.280
 The alternative is nobody tests and everyone wears a mask. You have a mask that maybe gives you

1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:58.880
 20% maybe protection during if you're all in the same room together, if that. Or you have a rapid

1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:04.480
 test program or everyone rapid test before and that gives you like 95% to 100% protection,

1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:10.560
 not 100% but close. And all of a sudden that allows everyone to take a big sigh and be like,

1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:15.520
 wow, this is the first time I've seen people without masks indoors in a long time. And I feel

1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:20.480
 pretty good in restaurants. Like restaurants are scary right now because you just don't know who

1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:27.920
 might be infectious and nobody's masked. And wouldn't it be great to just go into a restaurant

1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:35.280
 where you know that everyone just tested negative that day, just really reduces anxiety. It makes

1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:40.800
 individuals feel empowered. And I mean, at the end of the day, COVID and our response to COVID

1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:47.920
 it's truly an information problem. Why do we quarantine anyone? Why did we ever close anything

1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:52.320
 down? We didn't close things down because everyone is positive. We closed things down because we

1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:58.880
 didn't know if anyone was positive. We quarantine a whole classroom of kids, not because they're

1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:03.040
 all positive, but because we don't know if one of them are positive. And so we just quarantine

1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:08.080
 everyone when there's a positive in the case in the in the classroom like one day, we'll then ask

1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:14.160
 the whole classroom not to come to school for 10 days. That's not a biological problem. That's

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:20.560
 an information problem. And the crazy thing is we have the tool to solve that information problem.

1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:25.680
 It's literally our eyes on the virus. It's how we see this virus. And if everyone glowed green,

1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:29.920
 when they were infectious, we would have never had to close down anyone, any society, and we

1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:33.280
 would have never had the outbreaks because we would have been able to stay away from the green

1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:38.240
 people. You know, and yeah, I like what you said the quarantine is an information problem. That's

1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:44.160
 absolutely right. What is there something you can say to what people can do like listening to this

1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:51.280
 individuals? Do you just complain like loudly like why can't we do this? Can you speak with

1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:59.840
 your money somehow? What can people do to help? God, it's amazing to think you're asking me this

1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:05.680
 question. And this video will go out to, you know, the web and all the people that watch you. And

1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:11.680
 last year, in July, maybe something like that, June, I forget exactly when it was, I was on

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:17.680
 TWIV this week in virology. Shout out to TWIV. Those guys are awesome. They are awesome. I love

1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:23.360
 TWIV. And they asked me the exact same question towards the end. They said, this makes so much

1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:28.320
 sense. You know, why wouldn't we do this? What can people do? And so he said, oh, you know, just

1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:34.000
 send me an email like write to me. I'm sure you could find my email somewhere online and get in

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:40.080
 touch and I will, you know, and we can try to figure out how to make something happen. Yeah,

1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:45.760
 that was a bad idea. Very smart. Wait, too many emails. I didn't, I feel bad because I didn't

1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:50.560
 end up getting back to anyone because I just got inundated. But it did lead to the development

1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:57.600
 of rapidtest.org where we did automate the process of writing letters to congressional members and

1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:04.720
 elected representatives. So that helps. Fast forward to today. What can, what can people do?

1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:12.960
 I honestly don't know. Like what can the average person at this point do? We have tried everything.

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:18.800
 The FDA is immutable on this. They will not change and we shouldn't ask them to change because they

1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:23.440
 have decided that this is how they regulate medical devices and they're going to stick to it. So what

1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:31.440
 we need to do, and maybe this is something to do, is get, if you know people who have sway over

1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:37.920
 politicians, lobbyists, whatever it might be, let people know to request that the president, literally

1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:47.920
 the president of the United States, uses executive powers to just do something as simple as designating

1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:53.520
 these powerful public health tools as public health tools. Allow the CDC and the NIH or

1:14:53.520 --> 1:15:00.320
 whomever it must be or academic centers of excellence designated by the CDC to evaluate

1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:05.840
 the tests in a very fast fashion with the appropriate metrics that these tests need to

1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:11.600
 achieve for public health. And within two days, we can have 10 new tests authorized.

1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:16.800
 You know, this doesn't have to be a six to 12 month endeavor. This could be a two date endeavor.

1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:22.800
 We actually did it. I judged the rapid test X prize and it went great. We actually got

1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:29.440
 incredible metrics about how well does each test work and no clinical trials, you know, just

1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:33.600
 a couple days worth of work in the lab and boom. And if we actually systematized it would be an

1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:40.720
 hour or so in the lab. It was so simple. So I don't know. I mean, I don't know how to really

1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:46.960
 impact change. I've thankfully, you know, I have a platform and I've been able to start talking with

1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:53.520
 people who are very close to the president and the White House. And I do think that some change

1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:59.280
 is finally happening because the silver bullet of the vaccine has not panned out to be the silver

1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:05.360
 bullet. So now we got to, now I think we're moving from a country that was a vaccine only approach

1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:11.200
 to finally recognizing at the highest levels that there's other tools. Do you think it's possible

1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:16.960
 to reopen fully without solving the testing problem completely? Like, do you think this

1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:25.360
 vaccine approach will get us to reopen fully? I do. Yeah, I think over time though. I mean,

1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:31.520
 if we, a lot of people ask me like, what's, what's like happening? Like, what's the end game here?

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:40.800
 Like, where does this end? And it's actually not a mystery. The end game is we will grow out of this

1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:49.840
 virus. And by that, I mean, you and I, and most people who are watching this are adults, right?

1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:55.760
 Adults don't like to get infected with a virus for the very first time as adults.

1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:02.240
 Babies are okay with it. And so what we have to do to understand how we're getting out of this virus

1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:08.240
 is to look at babies like at newborns and say, okay, how does a baby get out of their high risk

1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:15.360
 time period? They get exposed. They get exposed multiple times or vaccinated, of course. And

1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:19.760
 eventually they get exposed enough that they build up this nice cushion of immunity that's

1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:24.400
 sufficiently diverse that they can battle whatever gets thrown at them because they've seen it already.

1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:30.960
 But one exposure doesn't do it. I mean, over the course of the first few years of life,

1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:34.960
 kids get exposed to coronavirus tons of times, lots of different viruses they get.

1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:40.720
 So unfortunately, what's happening with us, why this is so bad for us is that as we're adults,

1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:45.360
 we don't regenerate tissue very well. We have like overabundant inflammatory response. We have

1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:50.640
 all these problems that when we get an infection for the first time, it sucks. It harms us. It

1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:56.480
 causes us problems. But over time, just like a baby, we're going to start building up our immunity

1:17:56.480 --> 1:18:02.640
 through vaccines and exposures. I hate to say it, but tons of people are getting exposed to Delta

1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:10.480
 right now who don't know it, tons. And if you're vaccinated, you don't know it, is my point there.

1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:16.240
 And at the end of the day, this is actually, I do not want this to be misconstrued as like

1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:22.320
 saying, go get infected. But the fact that people are getting infected will add to our level of

1:18:22.320 --> 1:18:27.520
 protection later on. And so... Yeah, but the question is how long that whole process takes?

1:18:27.520 --> 1:18:34.160
 I think my guess is probably by the end of next year, early 2023, we will probably start

1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:39.040
 looking at this as though it is not a particularly dangerous virus for most people. The elderly,

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:42.880
 though, will still be, but that's because their immunity... Variants and stuff.

1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:48.000
 Well, that's the... I've heard other people say this statement. You just said a year ago about

1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:54.640
 this spring, right? Well, that probably was not wise. Well, I mean, it's because the intuition is

1:18:54.640 --> 1:19:00.080
 like, okay, now that there's a vaccine, you're either going to take the vaccine or get infected,

1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:06.400
 and then it'll be herd immunity over. It'll be very quick. So that's the intuition. But

1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:15.040
 it seems like that's not happening. It seems like work in this constant state of fear mongering for

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:23.360
 different reasons. It's almost like the virus got deeply integrated, not into just our biology,

1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:31.280
 but in the game of politics and in the fear mongering around the news, because the virus

1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:38.400
 now started being together with the vaccine and the masks, and it started getting integrated into

1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:46.000
 the division that's so effective at monetizing social media, for example. And so it's like,

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:52.160
 all right, so how do you get out of that? Because you can always kind of present certain kinds of

1:19:52.160 --> 1:20:00.480
 numbers about a number of cases or how full hospitals are and start making claims about

1:20:00.480 --> 1:20:05.760
 that we're still, this is as bad as it's ever been, those kinds of statements. And so I'm not

1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:11.920
 sure exactly what the way out is, except the same way out as it was originally, which is testing.

1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:18.320
 It's information. It's information. Yeah. And I think we can do that. We can keep

1:20:18.320 --> 1:20:22.720
 outbreaks suppressed with testing, because it's information. Like people keep thinking of tests

1:20:22.720 --> 1:20:26.960
 as big medical things. They're not. They're information. It can allow us to control things,

1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:34.160
 just like we drive down a road and we look at the cars and we don't hit other cars because

1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:38.960
 we have the information that they're in the lane next to us, and they're moving over. That's just

1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:45.280
 information. Like you said, glow green. The problem, the virus, you don't see. You're walking around

1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:54.960
 and everybody is a potential infectious creature. And so if you see the world as a potential for

1:20:54.960 --> 1:20:59.040
 infection, you're going to be terrified of that. That's exactly right. And that is what has happened.

1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:04.960
 And that's why I've been pushing so hard for these tests, because they can allow people,

1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:08.800
 if you use them at a community level, you can have enough people know that they're positive.

1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:13.200
 Enough people are good people that they won't go out and infect others. And the other great

1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:19.120
 thing about them is, again, a 10 day isolation period, especially for a vaccinated person,

1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:25.760
 but in either case, is also an information problem. We don't have to isolate for 10 days if we're

1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:30.640
 infected. What if we're only infectious for two, especially for vaccinated? Why are we telling

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:36.800
 people the only reason the CDC ever and the WHO ever suggested a 10 day isolation or a 14 day

1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:41.920
 quarantine is because we didn't know when people stopped being infectious. There's actually some

1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:47.040
 people stay infectious for 14 days. It's rare, but there's a lot of people who stay infectious for

1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:51.760
 like four. And that's a whole nother week that we're asking people to isolate. People would

1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:57.200
 probably be much more likely to comply if they only have to isolate as long as they wake up each

1:21:57.200 --> 1:22:01.280
 morning and see two lines, because you're actually seeing it for your own two eyes. You're being

1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:06.240
 empowered to make your own decision. You're not being told you need to isolate for 10 days and

1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:09.920
 you're sitting there thinking, oh, I feel fine. I don't know why, you know, there's a lot of

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:15.840
 asymptomatic spread. But if you see the two lines every day, then you actually get to,

1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:21.120
 you're doing a little experiment for yourself to prove to yourself, today I'm still infectious.

1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:25.200
 Let's hope it's tomorrow. Come on immune system, you can do this, you know. And then you get to

1:22:25.200 --> 1:22:30.960
 day four and boom, you start being negative. That's a much more tolerable thing because you are,

1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:37.600
 you are being able to make that decision based on true data that is empowering you. And it really

1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:44.320
 does change, changes everything, like because it's all fear and, and empowerment and these

1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:49.520
 are empowering devices. Well, I wanted to have this conversation with you because obviously

1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:53.520
 it's a great solution. Let's keep talking about it. People who listen to this should,

1:22:55.120 --> 1:23:02.000
 I guess, pressure local politicians, federal, national. Right articles, right articles with

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:08.480
 the title like Dear POTUS. Yeah. You know, please designate these as public health tools or just

1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:13.200
 start talking about in the media, talk it, talk about social media anywhere. Testing is a public

1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:19.360
 health good. Testing is a public health good. We all, like it should not be considered a medical

1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:26.720
 device. I shouldn't have to pay to keep you safe. Like testing should generally be free for that

1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:32.160
 matter, like subsidized by the government. These tools exist. They, we should all, and I think

1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:38.240
 that the more people that generate noise to just say a public health test is a public health tool,

1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:46.640
 you know, period. Like you can't even argue with it. Yeah. I think if you talk about it enough,

1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:51.280
 then certain people that have even a bigger platform like Elon Musk, Sundar Prachai,

1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:59.840
 those folks that have power to really do like large scale manufacture and also influence

1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:04.960
 governments will pay attention. And that's the hope and not people talk about it.

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:10.640
 I think business leaders like business leaders obviously have so much power here. Yeah. And

1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:14.720
 you know, they, they pay the lobbyists who, you know, make things happen. Like let's be honest,

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:18.400
 there's people who pull levers that are not the politicians themselves. And I do think

1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:23.440
 business leaders have so much to gain from these tools to keep their businesses safe,

1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:27.680
 to not have to quarantine and lock down. And I hope that all of them hear this message to say,

1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:32.320
 let's, let's ask the president or the people around the president to

1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:39.200
 to designate these as public health tools, change the system. And if you can't change every aspect

1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:43.200
 of the system, then figure out how to change the system enough so that you're doing everything

1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:48.880
 in a safe way that is not endangering anyone, but it is only protective. Yeah.

1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:57.120
 You mentioned last time that you spent time as a Buddhist monk. We like didn't spend much time

1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:00.800
 talking about it. I just would love to talk to you about it a little bit more.

1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:08.800
 Or maybe as a by way of advice, how do you recommend people can integrate meditation

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:16.960
 into their lives? Or how does one meditate? I think for me, meditation was

1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:27.200
 really an active effort, which sounds weird, because most people think of meditation as like

1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:35.840
 they lack the absence of activity. But just like anything, meditation is, it requires exercise.

1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:42.800
 In this case, it requires exercise and quieting your mind. And the whole, well,

1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:49.440
 there's a lot of different reasons people meditate. Most people watching this podcast or this show,

1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:53.360
 what is this called? I don't know. Is this a interview? I'm not even recording this,

1:25:53.360 --> 1:26:01.680
 just you and I talking. It is, most people are meditating to bring

1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:06.800
 some balance and bring some sanity to their life and just be able to control their feelings and

1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:14.640
 emotions a little bit more. And for that purpose, I think the best way to what meditation is,

1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:18.880
 if you can call it what you will, it's just getting some alone time, some time to think

1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:25.840
 or not think. Whatever and it looks different for each person. For me, it's a very active

1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:32.800
 effort to try to quiet my mind with the explicit intent to detach from things,

1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:39.520
 from lots of things. And it's actually, it sounds weird in our culture here to talk about

1:26:39.520 --> 1:26:46.240
 detachment as a goal. Detachment from loved ones, detachment from objects is kind of easy

1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:50.560
 to reconcile. People understand that, yeah, I don't want to be too attached to my car or whatever.

1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:54.800
 But detachment from a loved one is like a very hard thing because we want to do the

1:26:54.800 --> 1:27:02.400
 opposite usually. We want to love a loved one. But in a lot of Buddhist thought, it is those

1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:10.160
 attachments that keep people in this cycle of rebirth. Now, I don't personally believe in

1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:19.600
 rebirth in the way that, in a Buddhist sense, in that you actually get born multiple times.

1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:29.200
 I think my personal feeling is we die and we're vanished. That's just me. But I still

1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:37.360
 really found meditation to be extraordinarily powerful to feel control over a whole different

1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:43.520
 part of my body that I never thought that it could be controlled, your mind. You close your eyes

1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:51.040
 and most of us immediately start seeing blotches and we start thinking about things.

1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:56.320
 And it's an amazing feeling to start getting to the point where you can actually

1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:03.680
 actually quiet your mind and close your mind down so that you can just

1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:12.320
 have peace, silence of your mind for a long period of time. And I loved it. But it's kind of a

1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:16.880
 dangerous slope because you can kind of get caught up in it and really start going from,

1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:22.000
 okay, I'm trying to quiet my mind to almost being like addicted to quieting your mind. And it was a

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:29.440
 very active exercise every day, 15 hours a day to just practice quieting my mind. And eventually,

1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:36.320
 I could. And in Buddhism, there's a whole lot of stages that you go through to once you hit that

1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:42.160
 point where you can quiet your mind, then there's like other psychological things that happen. And

1:28:42.160 --> 1:28:49.440
 eventually, the end goal for a Buddhist monk who's spending their life meditating in the forest

1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:57.360
 is to achieve nirvana, is to have an absence of any attachment to the point where you're not even

1:28:57.360 --> 1:29:05.520
 attached to your own foot or your own leg. You can cut it off. So you don't even have an attachment

1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:11.440
 to self, like to ego, to conscious. Do you feel like a conscious being or no? Like the goal?

1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:18.320
 Well, I never attained it. But you know, I didn't really. So the goal is you have to first look at

1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:23.840
 it through the eyes of samsara, which is the cycle of rebirth, which is suffering. It's a cycle of

1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:28.400
 suffering. It's a cycle of suffering is how it's viewed. And the idea is like, if I really love

1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:35.840
 this hat, and then the hat gets lost, I'm sad. So that makes me suffer. And if I hate this hat,

1:29:35.840 --> 1:29:41.200
 and I see it, then it makes me sad or mad. And that, you know, is an emotion. But if I have,

1:29:41.200 --> 1:29:46.000
 if I'm completely ambivalent about that hat, I don't care what's there, I don't care if it gets

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:53.200
 lost, if it's shredded, then that invokes no emotional rise out of me, good or bad. And so

1:29:53.200 --> 1:29:58.640
 the idea is to find the balance there where you are so detached from everything that you're not

1:29:58.640 --> 1:30:05.520
 getting a rise negative or positive. And, you know, this is really, it's really such a distinct

1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:14.880
 thing in a relative to our normal lives here in America, where we live for rises, you know,

1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:19.920
 you want happiness and joy. And then you also, you know, nobody wants sadness, but like,

1:30:19.920 --> 1:30:25.040
 when you come out of sadness, you feel happy. Either way, it averages out, right? And if it

1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:29.280
 doesn't average out, then you're, you know, you're in a bad spot, like that would be

1:30:29.920 --> 1:30:33.360
 things like major depressive disorder where you're truly not averaging out. But if you're

1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:37.520
 living a pretty happy life, that's why there's no right or wrong. You can go up and down and

1:30:37.520 --> 1:30:42.560
 you average out, or you can just go that straight line. So this is not necessarily

1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:50.640
 the, the Buddhist ideal is somehow obviously the ideal you should strive for. But the actual

1:30:50.640 --> 1:30:55.360
 actual exercise of meditation that they, the Buddhist monks use seems like,

1:30:57.920 --> 1:31:06.560
 seems like a great tool for becoming aware of your own mind. And that seems to be important for

1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:14.400
 appreciating life. There's some, some kind of experiencing life on a deeper level.

1:31:15.520 --> 1:31:21.680
 I, I think so. I mean, that's my, my personal opinion is yes. And that I think it,

1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:29.760
 I don't meditate anymore. Back in the capitalist Western world where there's meetings and

1:31:29.760 --> 1:31:35.760
 that's right. I mean, I stopped after I, I was a monk and then the tsunami hit and I lived in

1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:41.920
 a refugee camp and I was, that was the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004. And it just really,

1:31:44.480 --> 1:31:47.280
 it was really interesting and it's really long because they wanted me, I asked, well,

1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:55.200
 what can I do to help? It was, it was a horrible, horrible, you know, hell on earth experience

1:31:55.200 --> 1:32:01.440
 in many ways. But when I said, what can I do to help? The answer was, well, you could meditate.

1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:05.440
 Like that's how, you know, be, keep, keep doing what you're doing. Like that's how you,

1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:10.000
 that's how we can get good karma. And to me, coming from like Western roots,

1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:15.520
 I just couldn't deal with that. I just said that doesn't make sense to me. Why would I just sit

1:32:15.520 --> 1:32:21.600
 and meditate when there's so much devastation happening here? And so I kind of stopped meditating

1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:28.560
 then and then never really recovered from that time in the refugee camp. But I do feel like I

1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:34.240
 understand or like I am aware of, of a part of me that most people never get the privilege

1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:41.600
 to be aware of. And that is a pretty profound and it's a, it's a profound feeling, I think,

1:32:41.600 --> 1:32:46.640
 or just awareness to say, I do have the capacity, if I ever need to go back to that, I have the

1:32:46.640 --> 1:32:53.040
 capacity to do that. And I do use it. I mean, I don't use it a lot, but I use it when I really

1:32:53.040 --> 1:33:02.720
 need to, to try to like settle, to settle myself to, to actually calm myself, whether it's pain,

1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:09.280
 physical or emotional pain, like it is possible to make those things go away. But it just like

1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:17.440
 anything it takes training. Have you, if you take yourself back to that place you were, you know,

1:33:17.440 --> 1:33:24.000
 Sam Harris talks about that through his meditation practice, he's able to escape the sense of free

1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:32.960
 will and the sense of agency. You can get away from that. Hey, do you ever think about consciousness

1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:39.760
 and free will when, when you were meditating? Like, did you get some deep insight about the nature

1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:46.240
 of consciousness that you were somehow able to escape it through meditation or no?

1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:54.080
 I looked at it in a much more utilitarian way, I think, and the sensation like minimizing

1:33:54.080 --> 1:33:58.240
 amount of thoughts in your mind and then beginning to really appreciate the sensation.

1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:04.960
 Yeah. You weren't writing a book on the free will. Right. And I mean, maybe if I kept at it,

1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:09.520
 you know, there's a good chance that if the tsunami didn't happen, I might still be sitting

1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:14.400
 there on the top of that mountain. Those anomalies, you see pain, you see, especially

1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:19.760
 if you see cruelty and you're supposed to meditate through that, that doesn't,

1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:26.880
 there's something in the human spirit that pushes us to want to help. If you see somebody who's

1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:34.000
 suffering to react to that seems like to help them as opposed to care less through meditation,

1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:36.960
 don't become attached to the suffering of others.

1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:43.440
 Exactly. I mean, that's, I do think that that's, you know, and they're two totally valid ways to

1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:50.320
 live life. Yeah. They are generally, I think they're ingrained in us pretty early in society.

1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:52.720
 Right. And it's hard to escape. Yeah.

1:34:52.720 --> 1:35:00.720
 What about just in general becoming detached from possessions like minimalism in not having many

1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:10.240
 things? So the capitalist world kind of pushes you towards having possessions and deriving joy

1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:16.480
 from more and more and better possessions. Have you, have you returned back to the joys of that

1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:24.400
 world or do you find yourself enjoying the minimalist life? A little of both, I think.

1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:30.720
 I really don't like, I find things to be a burden, to be a massive burden.

1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:37.440
 Yeah. And, and to me, when you have a burden like that, you know, even if it's just knowing that

1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:44.080
 there's like boxes in your basement of stuff, you know, whatever it might be, it makes it hard to

1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:52.880
 focus. And so I personally like, I mean, my ideal, like if I had a, my house, for example,

1:35:52.880 --> 1:36:01.280
 would be to have like nothing on anything. And, and that to me is like peaceful. Some people find

1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:07.760
 that to be not peaceful. For me, it's like, I love the, and I, to have the idea that

1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:15.200
 if needed, I could like pack up and move and not worry about anything. Do I actually have that in

1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:22.480
 reality? No, we're about to have a baby. You know, there's, but it's like, it's our, I already see

1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:26.560
 it, it's like stressful. There's like boxes of stuff showing up at the house, like bottles and

1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:34.720
 clothes and all these little hats and whatnot. And I do, I do have to like sometimes go into my

1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:44.240
 meditation to just, just say like, this is okay. You know, like, it's, it's okay to have all of this

1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:51.360
 stuff. It's not permanent, you know, and, but I do think that it's easy to get lost in it all.

1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:55.280
 And it's important to remember, given all that, like people who buy houses,

1:36:56.320 --> 1:37:02.080
 you know, buy a home and buy a house and make a home out of it. And you start a family, it's easy

1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:09.120
 to forget that even though you have all these responsibilities, you're still free. And like

1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:15.040
 freedom takes work and it takes remembering, it takes meditation on it, but you're free.

1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:19.760
 You're, you're born free, you live free. I mean, depends, of course, which country, but in the

1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:28.240
 United States, even with all the possessions, even with all the burdens of sort of credit and

1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:35.200
 owing money and all those kinds of things, you can scale everything down and you're free. But

1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:41.680
 ultimately, the people you love, you love each other, it doesn't take much money to be happy

1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:48.240
 together. And for me, I personally value that freedom of having the freedom to always pursue

1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:55.600
 your happiness as opposed to being burdened by material possessions that, you know, yeah,

1:37:55.600 --> 1:38:00.000
 that basically limits your ability to be happy because you're always paying off stuff. You're

1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.320
 always catching, you know, trying to match the neighbors that are always a little bit richer,

1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:09.520
 that kind of pursuit. I think that pursuit is wonderful for innovation and for building

1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:15.760
 cooler, better things. But on an individual level, I think you have to remember that first of all,

1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:20.880
 life is finite. And second of all, like your goal is not to get a bigger house. Your goal is to be

1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:30.880
 just content and happy in the moment. I completely agree with that. So in looking at our failure at

1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:41.440
 scale to engineer, to manufacture, to deploy tests, how do you feel about our prospect

1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:51.360
 of human civilization? Are you optimistic? So this pandemic, it is what it is. It hurt a lot of

1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:58.560
 people, both it took lives, but it also hurt a lot of businesses and a lot of people economically.

1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:05.600
 But they're very likely to be a much worse pandemic down the line. There might be other

1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:12.240
 threats to human civilization. Are you nevertheless optimistic? Oh, I don't think I'm optimistic

1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:18.880
 about it at all. What are you most worried about? It's one of those things that's so existential

1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:25.680
 that I don't worry about it. But I do think, I mean, let's, in the United States, for example,

1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:30.480
 so you asked about the human civilization, but let's talk about like an American society for a

1:39:30.480 --> 1:39:38.240
 moment. I do think that we're probably seeing the end of a really interesting experiment,

1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:43.360
 like the American experiment, and we're seeing its limitations. We're probably going to become

1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:48.800
 another blip, like another one, another power that's in the history books that rose and collapsed.

1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:55.600
 Probably that's where we'll go. In terms of civilization, I think we're demonstrating a

1:39:55.600 --> 1:40:02.960
 pretty significant inability to recognize the danger we're in, whether that's the pandemic

1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:12.160
 or whether that's climate change. I think it's extraordinary that we are not taking these things

1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:20.640
 seriously, and we're not acting with the urgency. And I mean, in some ways, climate change truly

1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:27.680
 makes this pandemic look like child's play, in terms of the destruction it has the potential to

1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:33.280
 wreak. I tend to think if you just look at the progress of human history, that the people

1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:43.040
 who do good in the world outpower the people that do bad in the world. So we kind of,

1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:49.120
 there's something about our minds that likes to focus on the negative, on the destructive,

1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:54.880
 because we're afraid of it. It's also, for some reason, more fun to watch destruction.

1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:06.160
 But it seems like the people who build, who create solutions, who innovate, and who just put

1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:13.760
 both on the emotional level, so love out there, and on the actual engineering level,

1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:19.040
 tools that make for higher quality of life, I think those win out, if you look at human history.

1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:25.360
 But the question is whether the negative stuff can sometimes peak to the level where everybody's

1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:31.200
 just destroyed. But as long as that doesn't happen, I tend to believe that there would be

1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:37.520
 like a gradual, with some noise, a gradual improvement of quality of life in human civilization.

1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:42.400
 I do think so, to a certain extent. But it's what you said, like,

1:41:42.400 --> 1:41:48.000
 unless there's like some significant peak of bad. And the problem with bad

1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:56.560
 is that it can happen like that. Good, you can't build a society overnight, but you sure can kill

1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:05.280
 one. I just think about food crises, and instability, and just, I don't know. But I do hope that,

1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:12.640
 I mean, I completely agree. I think we can engineer our way to a healthier, better world.

1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:19.280
 Like, I truly do. My concern is that the people who are doing that, until very recently,

1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:27.360
 don't generally rule the world. Now, of course, we're seeing non elected leaders and, you know,

1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:36.560
 people who run massive corporations, essentially, having as much or really more power than elected

1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:42.320
 leaders, or than kings and queens and such. So how they choose to wield that power, you know,

1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:51.200
 is an interesting choice. And I do hope that you're right in that, over time, fear will drive

1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:56.880
 companies to produce a better product or whatever, you know, something like over time, it's just like

1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:03.840
 predator prey models. You get so bad, or so everything gets so revved up, that all of a sudden

1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:09.840
 something cracks, and they say, okay, I do want an electric car, or whatever. And that takes some

1:43:09.840 --> 1:43:14.480
 combination of innovation, letting people know that these electric cars exist. It's kind of a

1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:20.320
 rapid test, too. You get to finally feel it and see it, have an electric car, and then all of a

1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:24.160
 sudden, things change. And everyone says, oh, this is so bad. And actually, I'm doing good for the

1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:30.640
 world, relatively speaking. And, you know, I guess that's the paradigm shift. Yeah. It becomes,

1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:38.560
 for lack of a better word, viral positivity does. And I mean, I believe that ultimately that that

1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:45.680
 wins out. Because I think there's much more power to be gained. So I think most people want to do

1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:55.040
 good. And if you want to wield power, you want to channel people's desire to do good. And I think

1:43:55.040 --> 1:44:01.760
 over time, that's exactly what people will do. But yeah, this, I mean, both on the natural side,

1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:05.760
 the pandemic, you know, there's still biology at play, there's still viruses out there.

1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:12.320
 There's accidents, there's nuclear weapons, there's unintended consequences of tools with

1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:17.680
 this on the nanotechnology side or the artificial intelligence side. Then there's the natural

1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:24.480
 things like meteors and all that that kind of stuff. And the climate change, all of that.

1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:31.920
 But I tend to think we humans are a clever bunch. And when there's a deadline, a real deadline,

1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:38.400
 or real threat before us, we kind of step up. I don't know. But maybe you have to believe that

1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:47.920
 until the very end. Yeah, that's right. It'll, I mean, we'll have to see, I guess, you know,

1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:56.240
 neither. Well, ideally, we won't be alive to see that. Well, no, Michael, I'm glad we talk again,

1:44:56.240 --> 1:45:05.760
 because this has been such a difficult time that feels like there's no solutions. And it's so

1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:12.080
 refreshing to hear that there's a solution to COVID. And there's an engineering solution on

1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:17.360
 the individual level, something people can do on the government level, something people can do

1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:23.280
 on the global level, something people can do, we should be doing rapid testing at scale. It's

1:45:23.280 --> 1:45:32.480
 obvious. It's amazing that you still are, you know, telling that story, pushing that message

1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:39.040
 bravely, boldly, I really, really appreciate the work you're doing. And I will do in my small way,

1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:45.760
 the same, to try to help out and everybody else should too, until we get hundreds of millions

1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:51.600
 of tests in people's hands. It's an obvious solution we should have had a long time ago. And

1:45:54.480 --> 1:46:00.000
 I like solutions, not problems. And this is obviously a solution. So thank you for presenting

1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:06.240
 it to the world. And thank you for talking about it. It's something that I can't not do. If it

1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:11.840
 saves one person's life, then it was worth the two years of lobbying for this, you know, and so

1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:17.120
 let's hope we see a change. Thanks for talking to me. Absolutely.

1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:22.720

1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:36.640
 Lord Byron. Always laugh when you can. It is cheap medicine. Thank you for listening and hope to see

1:46:36.640 --> 1:46:59.200
 you next time.
