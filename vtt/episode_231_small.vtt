00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
 The following is a conversation with Alex Gladstein,

00:03.280 --> 00:06.240
 Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation

00:06.240 --> 00:08.400
 and the Oslo Freedom Forum.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.880
 In recent times, Alex has focused on how cryptocurrency

00:11.880 --> 00:13.800
 and especially Bitcoin can be a tool

00:13.800 --> 00:17.880
 for empowering democracy and several liberties in the world,

00:17.880 --> 00:20.040
 most crucially, parts of the world

00:20.040 --> 00:23.560
 that are living under authoritarian regimes.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.000
 As a side note, let me say that I have been learning a lot

00:27.000 --> 00:30.520
 about the ways in which money can be used to amass power

00:30.520 --> 00:33.360
 and in the same way, the decentralization of money

00:33.360 --> 00:36.960
 can be used to resist the corrupting nature of this power.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.920
 Alex and I do not agree on everything,

00:39.920 --> 00:42.640
 but we strive for the same betterment of humanity.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.240
 He's sensitive to the suffering in the world

00:45.240 --> 00:48.160
 and is dedicating his life to finding solutions

00:48.160 --> 00:49.920
 that lessen that suffering.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.440
 Whether Bitcoin is one such solution, I don't know,

00:53.440 --> 00:55.200
 but I think it has a chance

00:55.200 --> 00:58.560
 and that means it is worth exploring deeply.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.240
 I'm staying in this path of learning patiently

01:01.240 --> 01:03.680
 and with as little ego as possible.

01:03.680 --> 01:07.160
 I hope you come along with me on this journey as well.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.280
 This is Alex Friedman podcast.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.400
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:11.400 --> 01:12.960
 in the description.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.640
 We recorded this conversation a while ago

01:15.640 --> 01:17.560
 and I thought I lost the audio

01:17.560 --> 01:20.560
 and was really disappointed with myself

01:20.560 --> 01:22.280
 for messing this thing up,

01:22.280 --> 01:27.280
 but luckily last week I found it and so rescued

01:27.360 --> 01:30.360
 from out of the abyss of nonexistence.

01:30.360 --> 01:33.600
 Here's my conversation with Alex Glasting.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.880
 What are some universal human rights

01:36.880 --> 01:38.960
 that you believe all people should have?

01:39.880 --> 01:44.600
 So free speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of belief,

01:44.600 --> 01:46.760
 freedoms to participate in your government,

01:46.760 --> 01:48.360
 the freedom to have privacy,

01:48.360 --> 01:51.080
 the freedom to own things, property rights,

01:51.080 --> 01:54.480
 these are all basic fundamental negative rights,

01:54.480 --> 01:55.720
 what we call them.

01:55.720 --> 01:59.000
 These are the basic fundamental human freedoms.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.480
 What does negative rights mean?

02:02.280 --> 02:04.880
 Negative rights are liberties

02:04.880 --> 02:07.200
 and positive rights are entitlements.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.800
 So after World War II when the UN came together,

02:10.800 --> 02:13.360
 it was largely compromised between the Communist Soviet Union

02:13.360 --> 02:16.040
 and the Free United States, right?

02:16.040 --> 02:18.840
 So the US had on its side

02:18.840 --> 02:21.240
 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights,

02:21.240 --> 02:23.480
 a bunch of liberties essentially,

02:23.480 --> 02:26.000
 things like free speech, freedom of association,

02:26.000 --> 02:27.280
 freedom of assembly.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.720
 The Soviets wanted entitlements like the right to work,

02:30.720 --> 02:32.680
 the right to have housing, the right to water,

02:32.680 --> 02:34.120
 the right to a vacation.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.800
 So you actually read the UN Declaration for Human Rights,

02:36.800 --> 02:40.440
 it's a negotiation between the Soviets and the Americans.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.040
 Later, there was another document in the 70s

02:43.040 --> 02:44.960
 released called the International Covenant

02:44.960 --> 02:46.760
 on Civil and Political Rights

02:46.760 --> 02:50.760
 and this is what H.R.F. uses as its sort of like load star,

02:50.760 --> 02:51.960
 its founding document.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.440
 And this is like essentially an international agreement

02:54.440 --> 02:56.280
 on the negative rights.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.360
 Those are the things we choose to focus on

02:58.360 --> 03:02.040
 because essentially authoritarian regimes can commit fraud

03:02.040 --> 03:04.280
 and claim they're giving the positive rights,

03:04.280 --> 03:08.200
 the entitlements without having any of the negative liberties

03:08.200 --> 03:09.040
 and they can do that

03:09.040 --> 03:10.920
 because they don't have any like free speech

03:10.920 --> 03:11.880
 or press freedom.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.560
 When you take people's basic fundamental freedoms away,

03:15.560 --> 03:17.880
 it's quite easy to make like a Potemkin village

03:17.880 --> 03:20.000
 and pretend that there's the entitlements

03:20.000 --> 03:22.360
 and that we have good healthcare

03:22.360 --> 03:24.760
 and it's the same sort of thing

03:24.760 --> 03:26.840
 that authoritarians have done for decades,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.840
 Cuba and Venezuela and the Soviet Union.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.160
 Do you think it's possible for authoritarian regimes

03:32.160 --> 03:35.640
 to manipulate, to kind of lie about the negative rights

03:35.640 --> 03:39.400
 as well by saying that the people have free speech,

03:39.400 --> 03:41.680
 the people have the freedom to afford assembly

03:41.680 --> 03:42.960
 and all those kinds of things.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.200
 Can't you still manipulate the idea

03:46.200 --> 03:49.200
 that citizenry still has those rights?

03:49.200 --> 03:52.720
 The opposition leader of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim,

03:52.720 --> 03:57.480
 he once told me the funny joke that in my country,

03:57.480 --> 03:58.440
 we have freedom of speech,

03:58.440 --> 04:00.520
 we don't have freedom after speech.

04:00.520 --> 04:04.240
 So yeah, they can absolutely manipulate whatever they want

04:04.240 --> 04:07.440
 but I've done research into socioeconomic data

04:07.440 --> 04:10.280
 and I guess what I'm telling you is that authoritarian regimes

04:10.280 --> 04:13.640
 which make up 53% of the world's population

04:13.640 --> 04:18.440
 across 95 countries, about 4.3 billion people,

04:18.440 --> 04:20.400
 those who live under those regimes

04:20.400 --> 04:23.520
 are subject to massive fraud

04:23.520 --> 04:26.600
 when it comes to things like literacy rates,

04:26.600 --> 04:30.360
 life expectancy, any sort of socioeconomic data,

04:30.360 --> 04:32.520
 economic growth, they can do this

04:32.520 --> 04:34.720
 because there's no free press.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.760
 So for us at the Human Rights Foundation

04:36.760 --> 04:38.520
 and for people like me,

04:38.520 --> 04:41.360
 we believe that the negative rights, the liberties,

04:41.360 --> 04:43.280
 the things that are in, for example,

04:43.280 --> 04:45.240
 the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution,

04:45.240 --> 04:46.560
 these things are the table

04:46.560 --> 04:48.040
 and then we can build on top of that,

04:48.040 --> 04:50.560
 we can build the rest of our societies on top of that.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.840
 The freest countries in the world

04:51.840 --> 04:54.160
 have both the negative liberties

04:54.160 --> 04:56.640
 and the entitlements like Norway, for example,

04:56.640 --> 04:59.720
 but there's a big difference between Norway and North Korea.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.480
 In North Korea, they only claim to have the entitlements

05:02.480 --> 05:05.000
 and they definitely don't have the liberties.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.240
 Do you think there's one right

05:06.240 --> 05:07.560
 that's more important than others?

05:07.560 --> 05:09.960
 You kind of suggested the freedom of the press,

05:09.960 --> 05:11.920
 maybe freedom of speech,

05:11.920 --> 05:13.600
 that if you take that away,

05:13.600 --> 05:15.720
 all the other ones kind of collapse along

05:15.720 --> 05:17.320
 with like from a ripple effect.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.760
 Is there something fundamental

05:18.760 --> 05:21.920
 that you like to focus your attention on

05:21.920 --> 05:25.200
 to defend, to protect, to make sure it's there?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.960
 Yeah, I think free speech is probably

05:26.960 --> 05:27.800
 the most fundamental.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.080
 It's probably why the founders

05:29.080 --> 05:31.280
 chose to make it into the First Amendment.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.640
 A lot of things are downstream from there.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.720
 Property rights are also very, very important.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.680
 Obviously, we've seen the toll

05:39.680 --> 05:44.160
 of violent redistributionism in over the last 100 years,

05:44.160 --> 05:47.880
 whether it was Lenin or Stalin or Mao

05:47.880 --> 05:50.520
 or other regimes and everywhere from Ethiopia

05:50.520 --> 05:54.600
 to colonialists everywhere to North Korea.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.760
 It's not a pretty legacy.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.440
 Is free speech clear to you as a concept?

06:00.440 --> 06:01.960
 There's been quite a few debates,

06:01.960 --> 06:04.240
 especially in the digital age.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.320
 What it means to violate freedom of speech.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.160
 There's been a lot of new like novel mechanisms

06:10.160 --> 06:12.440
 for people to communicate with each other,

06:12.440 --> 06:14.280
 especially on social networks.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.960
 And it seems that unclear

06:16.960 --> 06:18.880
 because a lot of times those are managed

06:18.880 --> 06:20.640
 by private companies.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.120
 It's unclear how much protection

06:23.120 --> 06:26.720
 do the citizens have to have when they're communicating.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.400
 A lot of people are being censored

06:28.400 --> 06:30.160
 on these social platforms.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.800
 Some people, even presidents,

06:31.800 --> 06:35.360
 get removed from those social platforms.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.840
 Have you thought about freedom of speech

06:37.840 --> 06:40.560
 in the United States, but in the world?

06:42.560 --> 06:47.440
 As it's implemented in the 21st century,

06:47.440 --> 06:50.360
 given the internet and all those kinds of things?

06:50.360 --> 06:54.960
 There is a Soviet dissident named Natan Sharansky,

06:54.960 --> 06:59.880
 who survived the regime.

06:59.880 --> 07:03.040
 And he wrote a book in which his thesis

07:03.040 --> 07:06.120
 was essentially the way that you can define a free society

07:06.120 --> 07:08.560
 through something called the town square test.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.160
 Can you go to a public space where you live

07:11.160 --> 07:13.800
 and criticize your ruler loudly

07:13.800 --> 07:15.920
 without fear of retribution?

07:15.920 --> 07:18.280
 If you can do that, you have free speech.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.400
 I think that's a pretty good litmus test.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.880
 Most people in this world cannot do that.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.560
 If you live in Havana, if you live in Moscow,

07:24.560 --> 07:27.160
 if you live in Beijing, you cannot do that.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.640
 And that's not a free society.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.800
 In Austin, Texas, in Boston, Massachusetts,

07:32.800 --> 07:36.880
 in London, in Santiago, Chile, and Tokyo, Japan,

07:36.880 --> 07:38.880
 in many democracies, you can do that.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.880
 And I think that that's a really helpful basic sort

07:40.880 --> 07:42.640
 of litmus test.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.000
 Does the content of the criticism matter?

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
 Can it be complete lies, meaning conspiracy theories

07:52.000 --> 07:56.600
 that involve claiming that the leader is, let's say,

07:56.600 --> 08:02.160
 a lizard slash pedophile slash...

08:02.160 --> 08:04.800
 I'm not saying that those are lies, look into it,

08:04.800 --> 08:08.680
 but they're very unlikely phenomena.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.480
 So does that matter?

08:10.480 --> 08:13.800
 I think it ends poorly when the state tries

08:13.800 --> 08:15.960
 to restrict speech.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.720
 I think that's kind of how I would define censorship.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.640
 I think censorship and deplatforming

08:20.640 --> 08:22.480
 are two different things.

08:22.480 --> 08:26.920
 Private companies, you know, they get to make up their own rules

08:26.920 --> 08:29.280
 about what's allowed on their platforms.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.600
 And I think that's very different from a government with guns

08:31.600 --> 08:35.640
 and an army restricting the speech of its citizens

08:35.640 --> 08:37.000
 with threats of violence.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.920
 These things are different for me.

08:38.920 --> 08:42.480
 That violence is a fundamental difference.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.440
 I don't know, I've gotten a chance to have dinner

08:45.440 --> 08:51.240
 with Alex Jones, and I've talked to him a few times offline.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.760
 And I understand why people are so off put by him,

08:55.760 --> 08:58.360
 but it does bother me that he's universally removed

08:58.360 --> 09:00.160
 from every platform.

09:00.160 --> 09:05.960
 It feels like there's many more evil people, bad people,

09:05.960 --> 09:10.960
 compared to Alex Jones, who still are given a voice

09:10.960 --> 09:12.640
 on these platforms.

09:12.640 --> 09:17.040
 And so I'm uncomfortable with the universality

09:17.040 --> 09:22.400
 of the application of the censorship by these platforms.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.360
 But on the flip side, you're right, there's not a violence,

09:25.360 --> 09:27.800
 there's not tanks, there's not guns

09:27.800 --> 09:29.480
 behind that censorship.

09:29.480 --> 09:30.960
 Yeah, it's a bit of a generalization,

09:30.960 --> 09:34.360
 but Alex Jones would be in prison or dead

09:34.360 --> 09:39.280
 if he were in North Korea or in Cuba or in Russia or in China.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.240
 The authorities would not tolerate him to do what he did.

09:42.240 --> 09:45.120
 And here, he can kind of do what he wants.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.480
 He's encountering some resistance in the marketplace

09:47.480 --> 09:51.760
 of ideas, large organizations, corporations,

09:51.760 --> 09:55.840
 and a lot of public sentiment in different parts

09:55.840 --> 09:58.600
 of our country don't like him.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.960
 They're doing their best to drown out his voice.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.800
 But that's very different from a violent threat

10:03.800 --> 10:05.280
 of censorship from the state.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.440
 And that's what we study.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.240
 That's what I study.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.520
 What is the state doing?

10:09.520 --> 10:11.560
 That's paramount for me.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.200
 Yeah, and that's true, because in the marketplace of ideas,

10:14.200 --> 10:15.840
 there could be a company that springs up,

10:15.840 --> 10:17.880
 that gives Alex Jones a platform,

10:17.880 --> 10:20.400
 and the United States is not going

10:20.400 --> 10:23.360
 to prevent those companies from functioning.

10:23.360 --> 10:28.360
 Of course, from a technology perspective,

10:28.360 --> 10:32.040
 there is AWS removing Parler from the platform.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.880
 It gets a little weird as you get closer and closer

10:35.880 --> 10:38.120
 to the compute infrastructure, because then you get closer

10:38.120 --> 10:39.200
 and closer to the state.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.360
 Actually, the more you get to the infrastructure

10:43.360 --> 10:45.240
 that's usually managed by the state,

10:45.240 --> 10:48.360
 the closer it gets to the control of the state.

10:48.360 --> 10:51.640
 I would argue AWS is pretty damn close to infrastructure

10:51.640 --> 10:53.720
 that's kind of controlled by the state.

10:53.720 --> 10:59.000
 If you especially look at other nations, China, Russia,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.800
 there's, I don't know who runs the compute infrastructure

11:02.800 --> 11:04.560
 for Russia and China, but I bet the state

11:04.560 --> 11:07.200
 has complete oversight over that.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.560
 And so that level of compute infrastructure

11:10.560 --> 11:14.680
 having control about which social networks can

11:14.680 --> 11:17.240
 and cannot operate is very uncomfortable to me,

11:17.240 --> 11:20.440
 but you're right, I think it's good to focus

11:20.440 --> 11:22.840
 on the obvious violations of these principles

11:22.840 --> 11:25.240
 as opposed to the gray areas.

11:25.240 --> 11:27.200
 Of course, the gray areas are fascinating.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.520
 You mentioned HRF, Human Rights Foundation.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.760
 What is it?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.320
 What is its mission?

11:34.320 --> 11:38.160
 Yeah, so I've been working for HRF since 2007.

11:38.160 --> 11:43.160
 We are a charity, a nonprofit, a 501c3 based in New York,

11:44.360 --> 11:48.760
 and our mission is to promote and protect individual rights

11:48.760 --> 11:52.400
 and freedoms in authoritarian societies around the world.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.760
 So again, we define about 95 countries as authoritarian,

11:55.760 --> 11:57.840
 meaning it's either a one party state

11:57.840 --> 12:01.840
 or opposition politicians are outlawed or persecuted.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.920
 There's no real free speech.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.000
 There's no press freedom.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.600
 There's no independent judiciary.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.320
 There really aren't checks and balances

12:07.320 --> 12:10.400
 and even trying to create like a human rights organization

12:10.400 --> 12:13.840
 or like an environmental group would be illegal.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.560
 And the majority of the world's population

12:15.560 --> 12:16.480
 lives in that environment.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.320
 That's very important.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.600
 You said 53%, 4.3 billion people.

12:20.600 --> 12:25.160
 And I saw you outlined a lot of different sources

12:25.160 --> 12:27.520
 of suffering in the world.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.400
 And then you sort of put people

12:29.400 --> 12:32.520
 living under authoritarian governments

12:32.520 --> 12:34.240
 as like more than all of them.

12:34.240 --> 12:38.520
 I forget all the examples you provided, but then.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.360
 Sure.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.880
 Yeah, maybe you can mention if you remember.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.320
 The number of people who are refugees,

12:43.320 --> 12:45.520
 the number of people who suffer from natural disasters,

12:45.520 --> 12:47.760
 the number of people who live under abject poverty,

12:47.760 --> 12:49.640
 the number of people who don't have access

12:49.640 --> 12:51.920
 to clean drinking water, all of these are dwarfed

12:51.920 --> 12:54.880
 by the number of people who live under authoritarianism.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.840
 And yet it's not something that we talk about a lot

12:57.840 --> 12:59.600
 because people are mercantilist

12:59.600 --> 13:02.400
 and the powers that be are happy to sacrifice

13:02.400 --> 13:04.880
 freedoms and privacy for money.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.480
 We live in a profit seeking world.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.640
 To get an evidence of this,

13:08.640 --> 13:10.440
 take a look at the list of sponsors

13:10.440 --> 13:13.520
 of the upcoming Olympics in China

13:13.520 --> 13:15.440
 where the CCP is currently committing genocide

13:15.440 --> 13:17.040
 against the weaker population

13:17.040 --> 13:18.600
 or look at the number of people

13:18.600 --> 13:21.320
 and the famous investors who went to Saudi Arabia

13:21.320 --> 13:23.880
 a couple of months ago for the Davos in the desert.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.680
 I mean, Ray Dalio was there, all kinds of people were there.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.000
 And at least they were invited

13:28.000 --> 13:29.600
 and they said they were gonna go.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.800
 And this is a government that at the time

13:32.800 --> 13:35.320
 was torturing a female activist

13:35.320 --> 13:37.000
 who just wanted to drive a car.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.240
 This is a government that had murdered Jamal Khashoggi

13:40.240 --> 13:44.200
 in a brutal fashion just a couple of years earlier.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.320
 So, I mean, at the end of the day,

13:45.320 --> 13:47.320
 when it comes down to brass tacks,

13:47.320 --> 13:50.280
 I mean, the powers that be,

13:50.280 --> 13:53.760
 even the free countries are led by people

13:53.760 --> 13:56.960
 who are very, very happy to sacrifice

13:56.960 --> 13:58.520
 all these pretty words about human rights

13:58.520 --> 14:01.160
 when it comes down to profits, unfortunately.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.840
 So, do you think capitalism,

14:02.840 --> 14:04.920
 that's maybe one of the flaws of capitalism,

14:04.920 --> 14:09.520
 is it turns a blind eye to injustices against human nature,

14:09.520 --> 14:11.440
 against the human rights?

14:11.440 --> 14:15.040
 Like it turns a blind eye to authoritarian governments?

14:15.040 --> 14:16.960
 Look, I think that at the end of the day,

14:16.960 --> 14:21.960
 like free trade is actually really good.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
 And you can just look at France and Germany

14:24.600 --> 14:27.360
 as an example of how like a capitalist structure

14:27.360 --> 14:28.400
 would develop.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.160
 If you have two capitalist actors,

14:30.160 --> 14:31.520
 they're very unlikely to fight each other.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.400
 There's very unlikely to be violence, right?

14:33.400 --> 14:36.840
 These are two countries which basically murdered

14:36.840 --> 14:39.360
 some large percentage of each other's male population

14:39.360 --> 14:42.120
 three times in a hundred years in three different wars, right?

14:42.120 --> 14:44.520
 And now today, war is like unthinkable.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.480
 And a lot of that is because of increased collaboration,

14:47.480 --> 14:48.720
 increased trade.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.480
 So, when you have two capitalist actors,

14:51.480 --> 14:54.600
 they act in a very productive way with each other.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.640
 But as soon as you introduce an authoritarian actor,

14:57.640 --> 14:59.680
 all bets are off.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.800
 So, I think what you have is a conflict

15:01.800 --> 15:05.520
 between capitalist actors and authoritarian actors.

15:05.520 --> 15:09.440
 And at the end of the day, people need to, yes,

15:09.440 --> 15:11.960
 have more than just capitalist intentions.

15:13.440 --> 15:16.400
 In the geopolitical level I'm talking about,

15:16.400 --> 15:19.080
 they need to actually take a stand for principles.

15:19.080 --> 15:23.000
 Otherwise, you have athletes and businesses

15:23.000 --> 15:25.920
 and governments that are all too happy to do business

15:25.920 --> 15:28.480
 with the Chinese Communist Party, for example, right now.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.720
 I think that there is a little more

15:29.720 --> 15:34.120
 than just kind of the pure profit, yes.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.160
 You mentioned what are the signs

15:37.160 --> 15:40.560
 that the state is an authoritarian state.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.480
 How do you know if you're living in an authoritarian state

15:44.480 --> 15:46.120
 or when you study another nation

15:46.120 --> 15:48.000
 and analyze the behavior of another nation,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.760
 how do you know that's an authoritarian state?

15:51.760 --> 15:54.560
 Is it as simple as them having a dictator?

15:54.560 --> 15:56.320
 Is it as simple as them as declaring

15:56.320 --> 15:57.520
 that they don't have a democracy

15:57.520 --> 15:59.120
 or is there something more subtle?

15:59.120 --> 16:01.240
 There's a couple of good litmus tests.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.560
 One is actually, can you have a gay pride parade?

16:03.560 --> 16:05.360
 That's a good...

16:05.360 --> 16:07.120
 Serious, it actually lines up perfectly.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.960
 It doesn't matter what religion the dictatorship is.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.120
 They don't like minorities and they love to scapegoat,

16:13.120 --> 16:15.920
 whether it's gays or religious minorities, et cetera.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.120
 So, it lines up pretty well.

16:17.120 --> 16:17.960
 That's really interesting.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.440
 If you cannot have a gay pride parade in your country,

16:20.440 --> 16:22.480
 because you're fearful that you're gonna get

16:22.480 --> 16:23.960
 the crap kicked out of you,

16:23.960 --> 16:25.960
 probably live in an authoritarian regime.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.440
 I'm sure that it's not just about some kind of homophobia.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.280
 Why is that?

16:32.280 --> 16:33.120
 That's really interesting.

16:33.120 --> 16:33.960
 It's scapegoating.

16:33.960 --> 16:34.960
 That's right, I'm going through.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.240
 So, the scapegoats, minorities.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.960
 There's another, you create another group and then you...

16:40.960 --> 16:43.720
 Yeah, Uganda is a great example of this,

16:43.720 --> 16:46.720
 but so is Saudi Arabia, so is China.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.360
 I mean, so is Cuba.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.800
 I mean, these are all regimes which demonize

16:50.800 --> 16:53.000
 the LGBT communities.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.520
 It's interesting because maybe you can correct me,

16:56.520 --> 16:59.320
 but from my very distant outside of perspective,

17:04.120 --> 17:07.080
 the way that certain authoritarian governments

17:07.080 --> 17:10.160
 speak about gay people,

17:10.160 --> 17:12.360
 is it's almost like, what is it?

17:13.720 --> 17:16.920
 We don't have gay people in our country kind of idea,

17:16.920 --> 17:20.120
 as opposed to scapegoating, which is like...

17:21.080 --> 17:23.800
 Well, denial is the most powerful form of demonization.

17:23.800 --> 17:27.000
 I mean, this is what the Iranian dictatorship does.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.480
 A few years ago, when Ahmed Ahmadjad,

17:29.480 --> 17:31.440
 who was then sort of the de facto leader,

17:31.440 --> 17:32.800
 he came to Columbia University

17:32.800 --> 17:35.120
 and he tried to give speech, which you can look up

17:35.120 --> 17:37.720
 and he tried to claim that there were no gays in Iran.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.800
 And that's the most powerful form of demonization

17:39.800 --> 17:42.160
 is trying to just wipe out your outer existence.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.000
 There's other good litmus tests too.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
 You know, for example, you can think about comedy.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.920
 Can you make money making fun of your government

17:51.920 --> 17:53.280
 on television?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.880
 If you cannot, you live in a dictatorship most likely.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.520
 I mean, it's shocking to people that I work with

17:58.520 --> 18:00.800
 who live in dictatorships when I tell them

18:00.800 --> 18:04.400
 that not only are comedians able to safely make fun

18:04.400 --> 18:07.240
 of our government, but they get paid very well to do so.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.160
 That's a hallmark of a free society.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.720
 So that's another good litmus test.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.920
 Hear that, Tim Dillon, you should go to North Korea,

18:13.920 --> 18:14.760
 check it out.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.680
 Yeah, and look, there are tons of flaws with democracies.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.000
 These are really good tests, by the way.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.280
 The United States is a deeply flawed country in many ways.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.040
 Our prison system is a disaster.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.880
 There's, you know, a horrible war on drugs.

18:26.880 --> 18:30.800
 We committed a grievous crime, in my opinion,

18:30.800 --> 18:31.720
 by invading Iraq.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.880
 Like, we did a lot of problematic things,

18:34.880 --> 18:38.520
 but our core architecture is still an open society.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.560
 The people who criticized the US the most,

18:41.560 --> 18:43.960
 usually live within it.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.320
 And if they were to move to a different country

18:47.320 --> 18:49.800
 and try to use that criticism against their new rulers,

18:49.800 --> 18:51.560
 they wouldn't fare so well.

18:51.560 --> 18:55.000
 So whether it's Chomsky or whomever,

18:55.000 --> 18:56.960
 if they were to go to Cuba and live in Cuba

18:56.960 --> 18:59.560
 and try to criticize Cuba like they do America,

18:59.560 --> 19:01.120
 it wouldn't last very long.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.360
 So I think what's important to distinguish

19:03.360 --> 19:06.160
 between open societies and closed ones,

19:06.160 --> 19:09.080
 or like free societies and authoritarian regimes,

19:09.080 --> 19:12.000
 it doesn't mean that your government's gonna be good

19:12.000 --> 19:13.240
 all the time.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.760
 What it means is that the citizens

19:14.760 --> 19:16.800
 have a way to push for reform,

19:16.800 --> 19:18.800
 have a way to hold the rulers accountable.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.880
 So even if you don't like what the US government does,

19:21.880 --> 19:24.920
 whether it was under Biden or Trump or Obama or Bush,

19:24.920 --> 19:26.960
 we can rotate them through voting.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.440
 And we have an independent Supreme Court

19:29.440 --> 19:30.720
 that rotates over time.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.920
 And we have people that we can elect

19:32.920 --> 19:34.720
 directly to serve our interests.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.680
 And then there's like a free press,

19:36.680 --> 19:37.880
 and there's lobbyists,

19:37.880 --> 19:40.120
 and all kinds of people that jostle for power.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.240
 So there's a separation of powers.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.640
 And I like to think about a free society

19:44.640 --> 19:48.080
 really as like at the bottom of the foundation

19:48.080 --> 19:50.600
 of the pyramid really would be free speech.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.360
 And then you would have civil society,

19:52.360 --> 19:55.040
 like for example, human rights organizations,

19:55.040 --> 19:57.640
 environmental groups, stamp collectors, athletes,

19:57.640 --> 19:59.120
 any groups that come together,

19:59.120 --> 20:01.600
 beyond the government's sort of strict instruction.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.600
 And then on top of that,

20:02.600 --> 20:04.800
 at the third level, you have separation of powers.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.760
 Again, what I'm describing.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.160
 So authoritarian regimes don't really have

20:08.160 --> 20:10.160
 any of these layers to them, right?

20:10.160 --> 20:13.160
 And then at the top, then you put elections.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.240
 But the elections are meaningless

20:14.240 --> 20:15.960
 if you don't have the foundation below.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.520
 Every dictator gets elected.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.160
 Kim Jong Un gets elected.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.200
 He's the only person on the ballot.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.720
 Every dictator from Hitler to Chavez,

20:23.720 --> 20:24.880
 they all got elected.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.520
 Elections on their own mean literally nothing.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.640
 You have to have these other layers beneath

20:29.640 --> 20:31.720
 to actually be an open and free society.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.160
 I think it was very important for people to understand.

20:34.160 --> 20:38.640
 Although Hitler in an interesting way at a certain point

20:38.640 --> 20:40.720
 just said, I'm going to be a ruler forever,

20:40.720 --> 20:41.880
 which is interesting.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.960
 There's an important switch that happens when you,

20:44.960 --> 20:47.000
 as opposed to having a facade of elections,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.680
 you just put that aside and saying basically,

20:49.680 --> 20:50.960
 like we're not even doing this.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.680
 Yeah, there's like a ladder that you climb the election

20:53.680 --> 20:54.800
 and you pull the ladder up

20:54.800 --> 20:56.320
 and then no one else can climb up.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.560
 This sadly happened in Egypt and it was quite predictable.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.760
 After Mubarak was ousted after the Arab Spring,

21:02.760 --> 21:05.920
 Morsi came in and it looked like,

21:05.920 --> 21:07.360
 the Muslim Brotherhood was not really

21:07.360 --> 21:09.640
 going to be very democratic,

21:09.640 --> 21:10.480
 but it didn't really matter

21:10.480 --> 21:11.760
 because then the military came back

21:11.760 --> 21:14.200
 and now we have Sisi who's even worse than Mubarak.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.560
 So a lot of times in these regimes, unfortunately,

21:17.560 --> 21:18.680
 it's very difficult for people

21:18.680 --> 21:21.000
 to build that democratic society afterwards.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.040
 Some people have told me that when you live

21:24.040 --> 21:25.960
 in a totalitarian or authoritarian regime,

21:25.960 --> 21:27.440
 it's kind of like a political desert.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.640
 What grows in the desert?

21:28.640 --> 21:30.360
 Scorpions and cacti, right?

21:30.360 --> 21:32.960
 So basically people with very extreme views

21:32.960 --> 21:35.160
 because you as an authoritarian ruler,

21:35.160 --> 21:36.840
 your best method for control

21:36.840 --> 21:38.480
 is to get rid of the moderates.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.600
 You have to crush the moderates, that's very important.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.800
 You wanna have the only opposition to be extremists.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.440
 That way when you go and have negotiations

21:45.440 --> 21:46.560
 with the United States,

21:46.560 --> 21:48.600
 you can kind of hold up the terrorists or whomever,

21:48.600 --> 21:51.280
 the extremists and say, it's either us or them, right?

21:51.280 --> 21:52.960
 And then the realists who run the US government

21:52.960 --> 21:53.960
 are gonna choose you.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.320
 And that's why, one of the reasons why the US government

21:56.320 --> 21:58.520
 has supported so many dictators around the world

21:58.520 --> 22:00.600
 over the last few decades.

22:00.600 --> 22:04.600
 Do you think authoritarian systems emerge naturally?

22:04.600 --> 22:06.840
 Like that's the natural state of things.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.200
 If you take, if you incorporate what human nature is,

22:10.200 --> 22:13.280
 well, is there always going to be corrupt people

22:13.280 --> 22:14.440
 the rest of the top?

22:14.440 --> 22:17.800
 And we almost have to construct systems

22:17.800 --> 22:21.520
 that protect us against ourselves kind of thing.

22:21.520 --> 22:26.520
 Another way to ask that is what kind of systems protect

22:26.520 --> 22:29.600
 us from our own human nature?

22:30.680 --> 22:34.440
 We started with authoritarianism or autocracy, right?

22:34.440 --> 22:38.040
 Ruled by one or a small group oligarchy.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.680
 And all humans lived under this structure

22:40.680 --> 22:45.000
 for the virtual bulk of all human existence.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.160
 Only until pretty recently did we start having

22:47.160 --> 22:49.080
 actual democracy.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.400
 The idea that we should be ruled by rules,

22:51.400 --> 22:53.240
 not by rulers, very powerful.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.280
 Invented in many places across the world,

22:56.280 --> 22:58.880
 Western Africa had this idea.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.960
 And so did the ancient Greeks.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.640
 And they started to implement it.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.000
 Although, as most know, we didn't have full democracy

23:05.000 --> 23:06.400
 for a long, long time.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.000
 Cause it was only property owners or only men,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.400
 only people of a certain race.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.400
 But this idea that we can like,

23:13.400 --> 23:17.200
 rotate our rulers and that we could be ruled by rules

23:17.200 --> 23:18.320
 is extremely powerful.

23:18.320 --> 23:22.360
 And it really like, for me, the ideas behind this,

23:22.360 --> 23:25.440
 I think unlocked a lot of the industrial revolution,

23:25.440 --> 23:27.120
 these small personal freedoms that were allowed

23:27.120 --> 23:28.560
 in some countries, but not others.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.760
 And they unlocked a lot of the scientific innovation

23:30.760 --> 23:32.520
 over the last few hundred years.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.920
 And to me, there's like a really straight line

23:34.920 --> 23:37.920
 between like scientific inquiry, free speech, freedoms,

23:37.920 --> 23:40.760
 and then more prosperity and more effectiveness

23:40.760 --> 23:42.760
 as a civilization.

23:42.760 --> 23:47.080
 So I think that democracy, you know, ruled by the people

23:47.080 --> 23:51.120
 is definitely an upgrade from autocracy or oligarchy,

23:51.120 --> 23:52.880
 you know, which would be ruled by one

23:52.880 --> 23:55.360
 or ruled by a small group.

23:55.360 --> 23:58.360
 And I think that the democratic revolution

23:58.360 --> 24:00.800
 has been an incredible thing for our world.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.440
 And it's, you know, you can do half class full,

24:03.440 --> 24:04.600
 half class empty.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.400
 The half class full is that almost half the world

24:06.400 --> 24:07.560
 lives under democracy.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.400
 Like that's an incredible achievement.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.640
 But just under half.

24:12.640 --> 24:13.640
 Yeah, just under half.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.440
 But that's billions of people.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.800
 It is billions of people.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.560
 And if you look at the progress of things,

24:20.560 --> 24:22.400
 it's getting better and better and better.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.120
 I mean, if you, you know.

24:24.120 --> 24:28.040
 Yeah, we're a little bit of a stalemate here.

24:28.040 --> 24:32.520
 Democracy is really blossomed between World War II

24:32.520 --> 24:35.760
 and the year 2000, especially in the 80s and 90s.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.920
 You had an incredible wave of fall, you know,

24:39.920 --> 24:42.080
 where many, many authoritarian regimes fell

24:42.080 --> 24:44.000
 and were replaced by democracies.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
 I think around 2015, the acceleration kind of came to a stand.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.280
 It came to a standstill a little bit.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.400
 There's some good news in some countries

24:54.400 --> 24:56.800
 and there's bad news in others.

24:56.800 --> 25:00.000
 Like in the last 10 years, you've had, for example,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.640
 the Philippines has gone backwards.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.480
 Thailand has gone backwards.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.880
 Bangladesh has gone backwards.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.080
 Turkey has gone backwards.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.400
 That's like a half billion people right there.

25:09.400 --> 25:13.560
 So you've had some positives, like, you know,

25:13.560 --> 25:16.920
 there was positive movement forward in Armenia, Malaysia,

25:16.920 --> 25:18.760
 some other countries.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.960
 But we're kind of at its stalemate right now.

25:20.960 --> 25:25.840
 And what most people fear about where we are right now,

25:25.840 --> 25:29.160
 who I respect, is what is the digital transformation

25:29.160 --> 25:32.440
 of the world due to this like progressive democracy

25:32.440 --> 25:34.080
 or of open societies.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.760
 And that's what concerns me the most.

25:36.760 --> 25:37.600
 Oh, interesting.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.960
 So I've, and we'll talk about one of the most fascinating

25:40.960 --> 25:43.440
 technologies, which is Bitcoin, how it can help.

25:43.440 --> 25:47.080
 But I have a sense that technology,

25:47.080 --> 25:51.360
 like most technological innovations will give power

25:51.360 --> 25:56.360
 to the individuals, will fight authoritarian governments

25:57.720 --> 26:00.320
 as opposed to give more power to authoritarian governments.

26:00.320 --> 26:04.440
 But your sense is there's ways to give for technology

26:04.440 --> 26:08.880
 to be utilized as a tool for the abuse of the citizenry.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.360
 I've seen both.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.640
 In my work at ATREF, I started by helping to put together

26:13.640 --> 26:16.280
 backpacks with foreign information that we sent

26:16.280 --> 26:18.520
 to the Cuban underground library movement.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.640
 So in Cuba, to own a book at the time,

26:21.640 --> 26:23.480
 you had to have the government's permission.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.800
 There was very little internet penetration.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.360
 So we would send in movies,

26:28.360 --> 26:30.320
 V for Vendetta dubbed into Spanish,

26:30.320 --> 26:32.920
 and people would sit inside their homes

26:32.920 --> 26:33.960
 and they'd watch it.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.800
 And they would answer questions with each other

26:35.800 --> 26:36.840
 and it was very powerful.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.760
 And then after that, I worked with people inside North Korea.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.160
 We would send in flash drives.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.760
 We have this program called Flash Drives for Freedom.

26:42.760 --> 26:46.640
 We've sent over 100,000 flash drives in our work

26:46.640 --> 26:49.480
 into North Korea, a country of about 25 million people.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.320
 That's a lot.

26:50.320 --> 26:52.960
 It's a big difference that's many, many millions of hours

26:52.960 --> 26:55.120
 of films, books, movies, et cetera.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.280
 So I've seen the power that technology can have

26:57.280 --> 27:00.920
 where in the 60s and 70s, to get,

27:00.920 --> 27:02.280
 to break an information blockade,

27:02.280 --> 27:05.320
 you had to send in crates of books into a communist country.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.840
 So now all of a sudden, you can send the entire contents

27:07.840 --> 27:10.280
 of what was once the Library of Alexandria

27:10.280 --> 27:12.000
 on something the size of your thumbnail.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.120
 Like that's remarkable.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.520
 So obviously I've seen the positives of technology.

27:15.520 --> 27:17.120
 We'll certainly get into Bitcoin.

27:17.120 --> 27:20.840
 But I'm very concerned about essentially big data analysis,

27:20.840 --> 27:23.440
 like what people call AI or general,

27:23.440 --> 27:26.680
 specific kinds of AI, like very concerning.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.400
 I think these are very authoritarian.

27:28.400 --> 27:32.040
 I mean, it's very hard to make a case that AI

27:32.040 --> 27:33.640
 is going to be good for human rights.

27:33.640 --> 27:35.720
 Very difficult, in my opinion.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.080
 It may be good for health.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.360
 It may be good for our efforts to protect the planet.

27:40.360 --> 27:43.040
 It may be good for a lot of scientific things.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.120
 I find it very hard to believe

27:44.120 --> 27:45.760
 it'll be good for civil liberties.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.640
 Oh, that's fun.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.560
 This is fun, because I disagree.

27:49.480 --> 27:50.480
 Give me your examples.

27:51.560 --> 27:54.000
 I'm serious, what AI applications

27:54.000 --> 27:55.480
 will improve civil liberties?

27:55.480 --> 27:58.840
 I thought you meant examples of stuff

27:58.840 --> 28:00.160
 that's already out there.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.040
 Because I can give you examples that, for example,

28:03.040 --> 28:04.880
 the kind of things that I would like to work on,

28:04.880 --> 28:07.640
 but also the kind of things that I'm hoping to see,

28:07.640 --> 28:12.640
 which is AI could be used by centralized powers,

28:13.240 --> 28:16.240
 by governments, by big organizations,

28:16.240 --> 28:18.760
 like Facebook and Twitter and so on,

28:18.760 --> 28:21.840
 to collect data about people.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.480
 Right.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.760
 But I believe there's a huge hunger among people

28:28.600 --> 28:31.320
 to have control over their own data.

28:31.320 --> 28:35.360
 So instead, you can have AI that's distributed,

28:35.360 --> 28:39.160
 or people have complete ownership of their little AI systems.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.880
 So the kind of stuff that I would like to build

28:41.880 --> 28:45.040
 or like to see it to be built is,

28:45.040 --> 28:47.440
 you could think of it as personal assistance,

28:47.440 --> 28:51.320
 or AI that's owned by you,

28:51.320 --> 28:53.280
 and you get to give it out.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.560
 You have complete control over all of your data.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.080
 You have complete control over everything

28:58.080 --> 29:01.760
 that's learnable about your day to day experiences

29:01.760 --> 29:06.760
 that could be useful in the market of goods and ideas

29:07.160 --> 29:08.160
 and all those kinds of things.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.240
 So it has to do with,

29:10.240 --> 29:13.040
 so I know you talk about surveillance,

29:13.040 --> 29:14.560
 which is very interesting.

29:14.560 --> 29:17.560
 It's who gets to have control of the data.

29:17.560 --> 29:21.000
 And I think, I believe there's a lot of hunger

29:22.280 --> 29:27.280
 among regular people to have control over their data,

29:27.960 --> 29:31.360
 such that if you wanna create a business,

29:31.360 --> 29:33.240
 you have a lot of money to be made

29:33.240 --> 29:35.080
 from a capitalist perspective

29:35.080 --> 29:38.600
 by providing products that let people control their data,

29:38.600 --> 29:40.720
 or you have no control.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.320
 Sounds like to me you're describing encryption,

29:43.320 --> 29:45.600
 or at least the ability to encrypt,

29:45.600 --> 29:49.840
 the ability to use digital keys to secure your property.

29:49.840 --> 29:54.480
 And that to me is a very powerful individual force

29:54.480 --> 29:56.440
 for individual rights, very powerful.

29:56.440 --> 29:58.400
 And it's what animates Bitcoin ultimately,

29:58.400 --> 30:00.120
 which we'll get into.

30:00.120 --> 30:03.920
 But for me, at least the way I look at it today in 2021,

30:03.920 --> 30:07.080
 the threat from big data analysis

30:07.080 --> 30:10.320
 used by governments and authoritarian regimes is terrifying.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.520
 I mean, to actually see what the Chinese Communist Party

30:12.520 --> 30:15.720
 is doing where they have hundreds of millions of cameras

30:15.720 --> 30:17.200
 overseeing society,

30:17.200 --> 30:20.520
 cameras that can tell who's a Uyghur and who's a Han,

30:20.520 --> 30:22.080
 that to me is terrifying.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.320
 And everything is sorted instantly.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.880
 There are supercomputers that are built

30:26.880 --> 30:30.400
 in a rumqi, in Xinjiang, for this explicit purpose.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.640
 And it allows the government to quickly sort

30:33.640 --> 30:35.760
 and basically commit genocide a lot faster.

30:35.760 --> 30:36.960
 And it's really scary.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.640
 So I do agree, and I've seen personally

30:39.640 --> 30:43.760
 how powerful technology can be as a force for freedom.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.960
 But I'm very, very worried about big data analysis

30:46.960 --> 30:48.120
 in the hands of governments.

30:48.120 --> 30:48.960
 See, that's funny,

30:48.960 --> 30:52.640
 because I tend to see governments as ultimately incompetent

30:52.640 --> 30:53.840
 in the space of technology

30:53.840 --> 30:56.400
 to where they will always be lagging behind.

30:56.400 --> 31:00.080
 So you look at what the Chinese surveillance systems are doing.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.960
 I believe when, once it started getting bad enough,

31:03.960 --> 31:08.960
 that like technologies would be created to resist that.

31:09.040 --> 31:12.160
 So to mess with it from the hacker community,

31:12.160 --> 31:14.760
 but also from the individual community.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.480
 So surveillance is actually very difficult

31:16.480 --> 31:20.280
 from a centralized perspective to detect,

31:20.280 --> 31:22.360
 to collect data about you, to detect everything you are,

31:22.360 --> 31:24.760
 because you can spoof a lot of that information.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.920
 So I believe you can put power in the hands of the citizens

31:27.920 --> 31:31.000
 to sort of feed the government fake data,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.200
 to confuse it at a mass scale

31:33.200 --> 31:36.680
 to where it'll make their surveillance less effective.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.680
 But okay, that could be very sort of hopeful.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.240
 Yeah, I mean, the practical application in Xinjiang,

31:42.240 --> 31:44.600
 which is a territory the size of Alaska,

31:44.600 --> 31:46.600
 where a large percentage of the population

31:46.600 --> 31:48.840
 has been put into prison camps.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.040
 The current issue of the New Yorker

31:50.040 --> 31:52.480
 has an absolutely harrowing essay

31:52.480 --> 31:55.200
 that tells the story of one such woman

31:55.200 --> 31:59.840
 who in I believe 2017 got sucked into one of these camps

31:59.840 --> 32:03.200
 and it took her a year or more to get out.

32:03.200 --> 32:08.040
 And she's talking about how in each home in Xinjiang,

32:08.040 --> 32:10.600
 each home has a QR code on it that the police can scan

32:10.600 --> 32:13.320
 and get like a quick instant download of who lives there.

32:13.320 --> 32:16.440
 Each car has like a scannable code.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.320
 Every single person has their DNA taken

32:20.320 --> 32:24.120
 and the DNA is being sifted through and analyzed by algorithms.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.520
 So this is like the Chinese government's laboratory

32:26.520 --> 32:29.720
 for how can we use technology to oppress?

32:29.720 --> 32:31.240
 It's like sort of like digital Leninism.

32:31.240 --> 32:35.680
 And that to me is one of the biggest risks in our world today

32:35.680 --> 32:37.280
 and it's not talked about enough.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.120
 That's interesting.

32:38.120 --> 32:42.400
 So technology basically enables the automation of oppression.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.240
 Absolutely.

32:44.440 --> 32:48.400
 But to define technology, big data analysis

32:48.400 --> 32:51.680
 and maybe specific AI, et cetera, does,

32:51.680 --> 32:53.800
 but encryption allows us to fight back.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.040
 It's very important people understand

32:55.040 --> 32:56.440
 we have tools to fight back.

32:57.880 --> 33:02.160
 Big brother can only grow if it can feed on your data.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.560
 If it can't get your data, it can't grow.

33:04.560 --> 33:08.720
 So you have to willingly give up stuff to the cloud

33:08.720 --> 33:10.160
 for this monster to grow.

33:10.160 --> 33:13.760
 We can like make the monster hungry and shrink it

33:13.760 --> 33:15.040
 if we give it less data.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.400
 And I think that's where I would agree with you

33:16.400 --> 33:18.880
 in terms of like wanting to empower people to be able

33:18.880 --> 33:22.520
 to do stuff on their own terms in a sovereign way.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.120
 And yeah, maybe you're kind of thinking

33:25.120 --> 33:27.200
 like the personal assistant who helps out Tony Stark

33:27.200 --> 33:28.360
 or something like that.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.800
 And that's, yeah, as long as there's no back doors

33:30.800 --> 33:32.640
 and that's a sovereign thing that you've popped up

33:32.640 --> 33:35.960
 and created and you have the keys to, absolutely.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.920
 But practically speaking, if we're talking

33:38.920 --> 33:43.080
 about the world today as is, we need to be concerned

33:43.080 --> 33:44.680
 about the way that authoritarian regimes

33:44.680 --> 33:47.320
 are using big data analysis and they're gonna buy

33:47.320 --> 33:48.720
 this software and this equipment

33:48.720 --> 33:50.880
 from the Chinese government, they're already doing it.

33:50.880 --> 33:53.360
 Street level surveillance has already been purchased

33:53.360 --> 33:54.960
 by governments everywhere from Latin America

33:54.960 --> 33:58.040
 to Sub Saharan Africa to the heart of Europe.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.800
 There's been huge scandals in Britain

33:59.800 --> 34:02.520
 over their purchase of Chinese surveillance technology.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.200
 Part of the Chinese government's Belt and Road campaign

34:06.200 --> 34:09.320
 which is basically to build the infrastructure

34:09.320 --> 34:11.560
 of this century and to be in control of it

34:11.560 --> 34:14.880
 is this part of that idea is to ship out

34:14.880 --> 34:17.640
 and install surveillance technology,

34:17.640 --> 34:20.360
 both at the telecom level and at the surveillance level

34:20.360 --> 34:22.360
 across dozens of countries around the world

34:22.360 --> 34:24.000
 and have that back door.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
 There's this national security law in China

34:26.000 --> 34:28.360
 which states that companies that are Chinese

34:28.360 --> 34:32.000
 which are abroad are mandated to send data back to Beijing.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.240
 So they are building this huge global surveillance state.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.320
 And again, not talked about enough.

34:37.320 --> 34:40.040
 You should go Google and research the Belt and Road.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.280
 And it's very important that we confront this.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.720
 Yeah, I'm really glad you're talking about it

34:45.720 --> 34:48.280
 because it's probably important to understand.

34:48.280 --> 34:52.720
 I'm also hopeful that as people get educated

34:52.720 --> 34:57.560
 about how much their data when collected, unencrypted,

34:57.560 --> 35:01.080
 but in general can be used to harm them.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.880
 I mean, it's almost like an education.

35:02.880 --> 35:07.880
 I feel like if you know, it's a double edged sword

35:07.880 --> 35:10.000
 because I feel like people become fearful too easily

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
 and that actually has a very negative effect

35:12.000 --> 35:13.760
 on the quality of life.

35:13.760 --> 35:15.880
 In some sense, you want to have tools

35:15.880 --> 35:18.360
 that allow you to live freely as opposed to live in fear.

35:18.360 --> 35:21.600
 If you live in fear, that's not a good way to live.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.520
 So it's a balance.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.480
 It's a free society versus a fierce society.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.320
 Yeah, fierce society.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.680
 And look, people are, it's all about the trade offs

35:28.680 --> 35:29.720
 you make in your daily life.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.400
 Like living more privately with more freedom

35:32.400 --> 35:34.840
 is less convenient.

35:34.840 --> 35:38.720
 You trade freedom and privacy for convenience

35:38.720 --> 35:40.520
 and comfort and speed.

35:40.520 --> 35:41.360
 Absolutely.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.680
 It's an engineering decision and everything that you do.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.480
 In the West, in advanced democracies,

35:48.480 --> 35:52.920
 we have not necessarily personally seen

35:52.920 --> 35:53.920
 the results of that trade off

35:53.920 --> 35:56.320
 because we live in these free societies

35:56.320 --> 35:58.520
 that have these checks and balances and freedoms.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.640
 But as soon as you step into an authoritarian state

36:00.640 --> 36:02.040
 and you make those trade offs,

36:02.040 --> 36:04.720
 your life immediately becomes more real.

36:04.720 --> 36:05.840
 More restrictive.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.960
 And what people are worried about is that

36:07.960 --> 36:12.960
 even in advanced economies, market democracies, et cetera,

36:13.280 --> 36:16.080
 the people are worried that they might not survive

36:16.080 --> 36:19.520
 the great social digital transformation.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.000
 Look at what the NSA is capable of doing.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.560
 I mean, for now, it's not that big of a problem

36:26.560 --> 36:28.960
 because we still have free speech,

36:28.960 --> 36:31.720
 but it's deeply concerning what Snowden revealed.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.960
 And it's a nice reminder

36:33.960 --> 36:36.920
 that we need to be focused on privacy and encryption

36:36.920 --> 36:39.800
 and on helping users become more sovereign,

36:39.800 --> 36:41.360
 regardless of where you live.

36:41.360 --> 36:44.000
 It's kind of like a crutch to live in a free society.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.320
 It's almost like a free lunch in a way.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.280
 You're not gonna be sent to a prison camp

36:49.280 --> 36:51.920
 because of the color of your skin or your beliefs

36:51.920 --> 36:54.080
 or what you say about the government.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.440
 And you're very lucky.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.520
 Again, most people do live in a society

36:57.520 --> 37:00.320
 where you can be persecuted for those things.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.600
 And I feel like, especially in America, we forget that.

37:03.600 --> 37:07.960
 We're distanced from that really strong reality, you know?

37:07.960 --> 37:11.120
 On the topic of Snowden and the NSA,

37:11.120 --> 37:12.960
 what should we be thinking about?

37:12.960 --> 37:15.160
 Because that feels like already an outdated set

37:15.160 --> 37:17.520
 of conversations because of the information

37:17.520 --> 37:19.440
 we've gotten from the past.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.440
 It feels like everything's gotten quiet now

37:21.440 --> 37:23.360
 in terms of how much we actually know about the...

37:23.360 --> 37:25.000
 Hugely important.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
 I think the two lessons from Snowden are, A,

37:28.000 --> 37:31.080
 the Patriot Act and the War on Terror and mass surveillance

37:31.080 --> 37:34.960
 are not necessary for our democracy and for our freedoms.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.240
 This was a false choice.

37:37.240 --> 37:40.240
 We never had to sacrifice them to be safer.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.680
 And we've seen that.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.160
 Government has spent hundreds and hundreds

37:43.160 --> 37:45.640
 of millions of dollars on these surveillance programs

37:45.640 --> 37:46.800
 that you can read about,

37:46.800 --> 37:48.720
 have amounted to very little,

37:48.720 --> 37:50.400
 except for tremendous bureaucratic waste

37:50.400 --> 37:53.440
 and erosion of our freedoms.

37:54.280 --> 37:57.280
 But at the same time, we need to practice more privacy.

37:57.280 --> 38:00.480
 And the dramatic increase in the usage of signal,

38:00.480 --> 38:03.920
 for example, has been really, really great to see.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.960
 It's fantastic that tens of millions of people

38:05.960 --> 38:08.360
 are downloading signal and using it.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.880
 You should try to be onboarding more and more

38:10.880 --> 38:13.520
 of your conversations onto signal, for example,

38:13.520 --> 38:16.240
 where governments can't see what you're saying.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.840
 Maybe they can see the metadata.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.480
 Maybe they can see that you sent,

38:19.480 --> 38:21.240
 your phone number sent a message

38:21.240 --> 38:23.560
 to someone else's phone number at this time,

38:23.560 --> 38:25.080
 but they can't see what's inside.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.600
 So using encryption in your life is very, very important.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.120
 That's a good starting point.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.800
 I would say that's kind of step A.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.360
 The ideas of democracy,

38:34.360 --> 38:36.400
 the ideas of the balance of power,

38:38.520 --> 38:40.400
 the, all the ideas that we were talking

38:40.400 --> 38:44.240
 about the constructs were inventions.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.520
 I wonder if there's other inventions

38:46.520 --> 38:50.120
 that will allow us to sort of not engage,

38:50.120 --> 38:53.760
 not give governments or any centralized institutions

38:53.760 --> 38:55.480
 so much power.

38:55.480 --> 38:59.160
 Like why do citizens have to use signal?

38:59.160 --> 39:00.760
 Why, because that's an effort.

39:00.760 --> 39:01.600
 You have to be,

39:01.600 --> 39:03.920
 because you have to understand exactly why.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.200
 So that's a nice little solution

39:05.200 --> 39:06.480
 for a particular set of problems,

39:06.480 --> 39:08.480
 but there's a million other ways that data,

39:08.480 --> 39:11.600
 I'm sure, is being collected constantly.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.360
 If we don't create a system

39:14.360 --> 39:18.800
 that prevents the establishments of these centralized powers,

39:18.800 --> 39:20.840
 then we'll always have this problem.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.080
 Yeah, I think we can keep it simple

39:22.080 --> 39:23.760
 for the purposes of this conversation.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.960
 You have politics, information and money.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.840
 Those are the three things I would encourage us to focus on.

39:28.840 --> 39:32.200
 In politics, yes, someone invented democracy.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.360
 I mean, whether it was the Greeks,

39:34.360 --> 39:36.640
 the West Africans or many others around the world,

39:36.640 --> 39:38.400
 around the same time invented this idea

39:38.400 --> 39:41.680
 that we should be ruled by rules and not by rulers, right?

39:42.800 --> 39:45.400
 And that has evolved dramatically, right?

39:45.400 --> 39:46.920
 And now you, and then you have information.

39:46.920 --> 39:49.800
 Information also used to be highly centralized, right?

39:49.800 --> 39:52.240
 You know, think about how rich you had to be

39:52.240 --> 39:54.720
 to gain access to a library before the printing press

39:54.720 --> 39:56.960
 or how much money you had to have

39:56.960 --> 39:59.800
 or how close to the king or the feudal lord

39:59.800 --> 40:02.600
 you had to be to be able to have that ability.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.880
 But now, the majority of the world,

40:05.880 --> 40:08.000
 billions of people have access to all information

40:08.000 --> 40:09.600
 in their pocket and they can set up an account

40:09.600 --> 40:11.480
 on social media and get their word out.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.360
 So not only politics,

40:13.360 --> 40:17.120
 but information has been dramatically decentralized.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.840
 And I would say that encrypted messaging

40:19.840 --> 40:22.840
 is kind of a corollary to that second innovation

40:22.840 --> 40:26.080
 and as much as now people are like more effortlessly,

40:26.080 --> 40:29.600
 like signal is a lot easier to use than PGP, for example,

40:29.600 --> 40:32.000
 they're more easily able to practice privacy

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
 when it comes to having private messages globally.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.280
 These are all good things and we need to keep pushing.

40:38.280 --> 40:40.280
 And I think money is like,

40:40.280 --> 40:42.560
 honestly, maybe the most important piece.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.440
 And that's why I spent so much time thinking about Bitcoin.

40:45.440 --> 40:50.440
 Okay, so politics, information, money, let's talk about money.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.160
 What is money and why is it important

40:54.160 --> 40:57.480
 to think about in the context of human rights?

40:58.520 --> 41:03.520
 I have witnessed money be peripheralized.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.720
 It has taken a backseat in the human rights conversation.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.000
 The idea of currency, who makes the money,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.040
 who makes the rules, who issues it,

41:12.040 --> 41:14.760
 who sets the interest rates, all these things.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.160
 It is not on the menu of human rights activists.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.760
 If you just do like a systematic study

41:18.760 --> 41:20.120
 of like the human rights discourse

41:20.120 --> 41:23.520
 over the last several decades, money is not there.

41:23.520 --> 41:25.080
 It's also not really taught in schools.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.960
 Like children don't really learn about money,

41:26.960 --> 41:28.040
 where does it come from?

41:28.040 --> 41:31.960
 It's kind of hidden from a lot of our discourse.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.160
 Only really when I got into Bitcoin

41:35.160 --> 41:37.920
 did I start learning more about money.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.560
 I spent 10 years at the Human Rights Foundation

41:40.560 --> 41:43.120
 and we did all kinds of programs around the world.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.680
 We convened Oslo Freedom Forums in different places

41:45.680 --> 41:47.840
 and I got to meet hundreds of dissidents.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.160
 And very rarely did they ever speak about currency

41:50.160 --> 41:53.760
 or bank accounts or moving money from one place to another.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.640
 But when I started asking them,

41:55.640 --> 41:58.360
 they always had amazing stories about money, always.

41:58.360 --> 41:59.800
 I mean, my friend Ivan Moire,

41:59.800 --> 42:03.160
 who started the this flag movement in Zimbabwe,

42:03.160 --> 42:05.360
 which ended up toppling Robert Mugabe.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.200
 When I asked him to come to San Francisco

42:07.200 --> 42:10.360
 to give a talk about hyperinflation, which he lived through,

42:10.360 --> 42:12.760
 he said, no one's ever asked me to do that before.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.560
 But I'll come and he came, this was about three years ago.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.200
 And the first thing he did when he got on the stage

42:17.200 --> 42:19.640
 is he opened up a shirt and he brought on a necklace

42:19.640 --> 42:21.920
 that had the 1980s Zimbabwean dollar on it.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.280
 And he said, we in the activist community wear this

42:25.280 --> 42:27.120
 as a symbol of where our country used to be

42:27.120 --> 42:29.160
 because the Zimbabwean dollar used to be worth

42:29.160 --> 42:30.200
 two British pounds.

42:30.200 --> 42:33.640
 And then of course, over the next two and a half decades

42:33.640 --> 42:37.040
 of economic mismanagement and corruption by Mugabe,

42:37.040 --> 42:38.560
 it got inflated out of existence, right?

42:38.560 --> 42:41.880
 You've seen those like $100 trillion Zimbabwean notes.

42:41.880 --> 42:44.040
 So he had to live through that, which was terrible

42:44.040 --> 42:47.440
 and crushing, but he is an expert on money.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.920
 If you actually talk to human rights activists about money,

42:49.920 --> 42:51.800
 they know a lot about money.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.200
 They're just not usually asked to talk about it.

42:54.200 --> 42:59.200
 So for me, when I study money or look at money,

42:59.600 --> 43:01.120
 it's really about control.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.280
 Who's creating it and how much does the population know

43:04.280 --> 43:06.480
 about the creation of that money?

43:06.480 --> 43:09.360
 And when it comes to Bitcoin, it's really the people's money.

43:09.360 --> 43:12.480
 Like there is no shadowy force in charge of it.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.960
 We all know the rules.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.600
 We all know how it's gonna get minted

43:15.600 --> 43:17.280
 and how it's gonna get printed.

43:17.280 --> 43:20.400
 And that information is out there for everybody to see.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.300
 And there's no special group of rules

43:22.300 --> 43:25.520
 for one group of people or another group.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.200
 A billionaire and a refugee are the same

43:28.200 --> 43:30.000
 in the eyes of the protocol.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.140
 This is a rather revolutionary concept.

43:33.140 --> 43:35.880
 And in the same way that democracy allowed us

43:35.880 --> 43:38.880
 to decentralize politics and have checks and balances.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.360
 And in the same way that the internet

43:40.360 --> 43:41.880
 is this culmination of technologies

43:41.880 --> 43:44.680
 that allowed us to decentralize information,

43:44.680 --> 43:47.000
 access to and control over it.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.800
 Bitcoin, decentralizes money.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.920
 I mean, no longer, again, is there one group of people

43:52.920 --> 43:54.840
 who can just change it arbitrarily.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.920
 We're all in the same playing field.

43:56.920 --> 43:59.320
 And I think that that is a tremendous innovation.

44:01.080 --> 44:03.760
 You know, from one perspective, money and inflation,

44:03.760 --> 44:08.040
 hyperinflation is a kind of symptom of corruption

44:08.040 --> 44:10.360
 as opposed to the core of the corruption.

44:11.560 --> 44:15.440
 And at the flip side, in terms of resisting the corruption,

44:15.440 --> 44:19.260
 resisting the abuse of human rights,

44:20.320 --> 44:24.800
 it's interesting to think that fighting inflation

44:24.800 --> 44:29.800
 or fighting the mismanagement of the money supply

44:32.300 --> 44:34.960
 is a way to fight back authoritarianism

44:34.960 --> 44:39.960
 or to fight authoritarianism. And that's an interesting

44:39.980 --> 44:42.520
 concept that I think was introduced to me

44:42.520 --> 44:45.040
 by just plugging myself intellectually

44:45.040 --> 44:46.160
 into the Bitcoin community,

44:46.160 --> 44:48.560
 but also just cryptocurrency in general.

44:48.560 --> 44:53.560
 It's to like, it's not that money is a symptom.

44:54.800 --> 44:57.920
 You know, money is a tool to fight back too.

44:58.760 --> 45:00.160
 Absolutely.

45:00.160 --> 45:04.080
 So in what way can Bitcoin be used

45:04.080 --> 45:09.080
 to fight authoritarianism, not just in the United States,

45:10.320 --> 45:13.640
 but all of those 53% that you're referring to,

45:13.640 --> 45:15.360
 how can Bitcoin help?

45:15.360 --> 45:17.520
 So we talked about authoritarianism

45:17.520 --> 45:20.240
 and we talked about the surveillance state.

45:20.240 --> 45:23.560
 To me, Bitcoin has two kind of key mechanisms

45:23.560 --> 45:24.960
 through which it can help us.

45:25.900 --> 45:29.160
 Number one, it's a sovereign savings account.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.400
 It's debasement proof,

45:30.400 --> 45:32.040
 meaning the government cannot print more

45:32.040 --> 45:33.720
 whenever they want.

45:33.720 --> 45:35.960
 This is very, very different from fiat currency,

45:35.960 --> 45:38.520
 which by its very name, its very nature,

45:38.520 --> 45:41.840
 can be issued on sort of demand by the rulers.

45:41.840 --> 45:44.520
 And while I live in a country where the rulers

45:44.520 --> 45:47.440
 do a reasonable job managing the money,

45:47.440 --> 45:48.800
 most people aren't so lucky.

45:48.800 --> 45:52.320
 So only 13% of humans in the world live in a country

45:52.320 --> 45:54.640
 that's a liberal democracy with property rights

45:54.640 --> 45:57.040
 and has what we call a reserve currency,

45:57.040 --> 45:58.960
 meaning a currency so stable and desirable

45:58.960 --> 46:00.400
 that other countries save in it

46:00.400 --> 46:02.120
 at the central bank level.

46:02.120 --> 46:06.080
 You basically have the US, the UK, Australia,

46:06.080 --> 46:09.000
 Switzerland, the Euro, and Canada.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.640
 I mean, those are like reserve currencies

46:10.640 --> 46:11.880
 and these are liberal democracies

46:11.880 --> 46:13.160
 where people have reasonable guarantees

46:13.160 --> 46:14.280
 over property rights.

46:14.280 --> 46:17.800
 Everybody else either lives under like a weaker currency

46:17.800 --> 46:19.440
 or an authoritarian regime.

46:19.440 --> 46:21.320
 That's 87% of the world's population,

46:21.320 --> 46:22.720
 almost 7 billion people.

46:22.720 --> 46:26.120
 So for them, a sovereign savings account

46:26.120 --> 46:26.960
 that's permissionless,

46:26.960 --> 46:28.920
 meaning you don't have to have ID to use it,

46:28.920 --> 46:30.200
 is a big, big deal.

46:30.200 --> 46:31.440
 And a lot of people talk about

46:31.440 --> 46:34.400
 in Bobway or Venezuela has some like isolated cases.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.960
 Oh, well, you know, hyperinflation only happens

46:36.960 --> 46:39.120
 in those two countries.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.680
 I actually did some research into this

46:40.680 --> 46:45.280
 and there's about one point over, you know,

46:45.280 --> 46:46.880
 close to 1.3 billion people

46:46.880 --> 46:49.160
 who live under double or triple digit inflation.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.200
 This is not an isolated instance.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.760
 We're talking huge countries.

46:52.760 --> 46:55.960
 Nigeria, 200 million people, 15% inflation.

46:55.960 --> 46:59.400
 Turkey, 15% inflation for 100 million people.

46:59.400 --> 47:04.000
 Argentina, 40% inflation for a country of 45 million people.

47:04.000 --> 47:04.880
 So you can go down the list.

47:04.880 --> 47:06.560
 There's about 35 countries

47:06.560 --> 47:09.680
 where like people's earnings, their wages

47:09.680 --> 47:12.200
 are literally disappearing in front of their eyes

47:12.200 --> 47:14.040
 over a matter of weeks or months

47:14.040 --> 47:17.240
 against things like the dollar, gold, real estate, right?

47:17.240 --> 47:19.480
 So this is a huge issue.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.200
 It absolutely is a human rights issue for me.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.240
 I mean, when it comes to your time and energy,

47:23.240 --> 47:26.280
 having control over that or having it stolen from you,

47:26.280 --> 47:27.840
 I think this is pretty clear.

47:27.840 --> 47:31.440
 And Bitcoin is like an immediate low cost,

47:31.440 --> 47:34.000
 easily accessible solution for people.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.160
 And I've learned this not from my own assumptions

47:37.160 --> 47:40.800
 but by talking to people, by interviewing dozens of people,

47:40.800 --> 47:42.640
 whether it's in Sudan,

47:42.640 --> 47:45.680
 which currently has triple digit inflation,

47:45.680 --> 47:48.800
 or people who've escaped from Syria

47:48.800 --> 47:51.480
 who have used Bitcoin to get their wealth out of the country

47:51.480 --> 47:54.560
 and then also to make payments back to people inside

47:54.560 --> 47:56.200
 or Venezuela or elsewhere.

47:56.200 --> 47:58.280
 It's very, very powerful.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.400
 I think some very small percentage of people

48:00.400 --> 48:02.640
 have used, have owned Bitcoin.

48:02.640 --> 48:05.240
 So it's something like 1% of the world.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.040
 Whatever the number is, the small...

48:07.040 --> 48:09.320
 Call it 2% for the purposes of our account.

48:09.320 --> 48:12.200
 About a little under 200 million people.

48:12.200 --> 48:13.120
 Wow, yeah.

48:14.120 --> 48:15.040
 At most, right now.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.920
 So if we look at Zimbabwe, Sudan, if we look at...

48:17.920 --> 48:19.800
 Small percentages of people.

48:19.800 --> 48:22.280
 Do you think the technology is mature enough?

48:22.280 --> 48:23.680
 Because it's not just about the idea,

48:23.680 --> 48:25.640
 it's also about the implementation of it.

48:25.640 --> 48:29.560
 Like, you know, Bitcoin, for the most part,

48:29.560 --> 48:32.840
 requires access to the internet.

48:32.840 --> 48:33.680
 Yeah.

48:33.680 --> 48:38.680
 And what do you think about accessibility of this technology

48:39.880 --> 48:41.880
 now as a method of activism

48:41.880 --> 48:43.360
 in the worst parts of the world?

48:43.360 --> 48:45.400
 We often think like all the conversations we've had

48:45.400 --> 48:48.240
 about Bitcoin is essentially middle class,

48:48.240 --> 48:51.080
 like wealthy people relative to the rest of the world.

48:51.080 --> 48:53.400
 They're kind of talking with sort of investment

48:53.400 --> 48:55.880
 and high concept ideas.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.280
 Then there's also the people in the world who are suffering,

48:58.280 --> 49:01.000
 who are living through hyperinflation.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.400
 They may not have a computer access to the internet.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.920
 Like, how do you think Bitcoin can help there?

49:05.920 --> 49:08.960
 Yeah, so again, we have one clear use case,

49:08.960 --> 49:10.640
 which is a sovereign savings account

49:10.640 --> 49:12.000
 that you can control, right?

49:12.000 --> 49:15.120
 The other use case is an unstoppable payments network.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.360
 This is very important for people

49:16.360 --> 49:18.520
 who live behind, for example, sanctions.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.720
 Like the US basically weaponizes the dollar

49:21.720 --> 49:24.200
 and it like sanctions different countries.

49:24.200 --> 49:26.960
 And instead of sanctioning like a handful of rulers,

49:26.960 --> 49:28.360
 for example, which I would support,

49:28.360 --> 49:30.680
 this is like a Magnitsky or smart sanctions.

49:30.680 --> 49:31.680
 Sometimes we'll just say,

49:31.680 --> 49:33.080
 we're just gonna shut off this whole country.

49:33.080 --> 49:33.920
 So then people suffer.

49:33.920 --> 49:34.760
 And then people suffer.

49:34.760 --> 49:35.960
 Cuba or Iran are good examples.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.560
 Average people suffer, right?

49:37.560 --> 49:40.040
 So people in those two countries I just mentioned,

49:40.040 --> 49:41.800
 Cuba, Iran or even Palestine,

49:41.800 --> 49:45.440
 which is also sort of like blockaded by the Israelis.

49:45.440 --> 49:48.600
 So you have Cuba, Iran, Palestine are three good examples

49:48.600 --> 49:50.840
 where people inside all three of those countries now

49:50.840 --> 49:53.640
 are using Bitcoin to do commerce, do their business,

49:53.640 --> 49:55.120
 send money back and forth to their families.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.280
 So the sanctions resistant.

49:56.280 --> 49:57.600
 Sanctions resistant.

49:57.600 --> 49:59.800
 It does not get stopped by sanctions, right?

50:00.840 --> 50:03.960
 And also it's, again, remittances are extortionate.

50:03.960 --> 50:08.400
 I mean, the average remittance costs as a high fee

50:08.400 --> 50:09.520
 take several days.

50:09.520 --> 50:11.840
 If your family is in Ghana or something like that

50:11.840 --> 50:13.560
 or Nigeria and you live in the United States,

50:13.560 --> 50:16.000
 it can take time to use Western Union.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.600
 Sometimes, oh, it gets paused, it gets lost,

50:18.600 --> 50:20.720
 there's issues, you have to deal with customer service.

50:20.720 --> 50:21.560
 Screw that.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.960
 I mean, you know, the person has a cell phone

50:23.960 --> 50:25.920
 which increasingly is the case.

50:25.920 --> 50:27.480
 I mean, by the end of next year,

50:28.880 --> 50:30.840
 more than five or six billion people,

50:30.840 --> 50:31.840
 depending on different estimates,

50:31.840 --> 50:35.640
 will have smartphones basically by the end of 2022.

50:35.640 --> 50:38.240
 We're talking like the vast majority of humans

50:38.240 --> 50:40.000
 will have access to smartphones.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.320
 They can all have sovereign Bitcoin wallets.

50:42.320 --> 50:46.200
 And there's even ways to access Bitcoin without the internet.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.760
 But I mean, we can get into that.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.440
 There's like hardware wallets and so on.

50:50.440 --> 50:54.080
 What do you mean by sovereign Bitcoin wallet?

50:55.360 --> 50:58.240
 You know, most users today are using Bitcoin

50:58.240 --> 51:00.240
 in a custodial manner.

51:00.240 --> 51:03.280
 So this is kind of like having a bank account

51:03.280 --> 51:07.200
 where you have a deposit account at a bank, right?

51:07.200 --> 51:08.600
 So you have a claim, right?

51:08.600 --> 51:10.760
 You go to the bank and they have some of your money

51:10.760 --> 51:12.000
 and you take it out, right?

51:12.000 --> 51:13.240
 Used with an ATM.

51:13.240 --> 51:17.960
 So what I would call non custodial Bitcoin use

51:17.960 --> 51:20.920
 would be similar to withdrawing cash from an ATM.

51:20.920 --> 51:23.040
 You have it, it's a bear instrument, okay?

51:23.040 --> 51:25.360
 So when I, it's what's called a bear instrument.

51:25.360 --> 51:26.480
 I know, I apologize.

51:26.480 --> 51:28.040
 I'm outside of this community just selling smartphones.

51:28.040 --> 51:28.880
 No, no, it's, yeah.

51:28.880 --> 51:30.920
 So like a bear instrument would be like a bar of gold

51:30.920 --> 51:35.160
 or a bank note or Bitcoin that you control,

51:35.160 --> 51:37.240
 meaning you have the seed phrase, right?

51:37.240 --> 51:40.960
 Which for the listeners essentially is 12 to 24

51:40.960 --> 51:42.760
 English words that you write down on a piece of paper.

51:42.760 --> 51:46.200
 That's your like password to get into your Bitcoin account.

51:46.200 --> 51:49.400
 And that gives you that bear instrument quality, right?

51:49.400 --> 51:53.480
 But unfortunately, most users still use Bitcoin

51:53.480 --> 51:56.320
 in a custodial way, meaning they buy it on Coinbase

51:56.320 --> 51:58.400
 or Square or something like that.

51:58.400 --> 52:00.400
 You would put into the.

52:00.400 --> 52:01.240
 Custodial.

52:01.240 --> 52:03.840
 Into the custodial category like a bank, yeah.

52:03.840 --> 52:06.280
 And look, the good news is you can withdraw

52:06.280 --> 52:07.440
 to your own control.

52:07.440 --> 52:08.960
 And in the Bitcoin community,

52:08.960 --> 52:11.200
 we try to teach this idea that it's not your keys,

52:11.200 --> 52:13.760
 not your coins, in the same way that if you deposit

52:13.760 --> 52:15.680
 your money at the bank, you might not get it back.

52:15.680 --> 52:19.640
 I mean, it's low likelihood, but it's very possible.

52:19.640 --> 52:20.560
 Same thing in Bitcoin.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.080
 Like if you wanna get the full experience,

52:22.080 --> 52:24.320
 you wanna actually custody your own Bitcoin.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.920
 And you wanna put it whether it's on an open source

52:26.920 --> 52:29.240
 software wallet, like the blue wallet is a good one

52:29.240 --> 52:31.760
 for people to check out or a hardware wallet

52:31.760 --> 52:33.600
 like cold card, for example.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.600
 There's different ways to do this.

52:35.600 --> 52:38.000
 But essentially like around the world,

52:38.000 --> 52:39.560
 people are innovating.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.920
 Like don't think so low of your fellow man.

52:41.920 --> 52:42.760
 You know what I mean?

52:42.760 --> 52:44.640
 Like people are able to figure this out.

52:44.640 --> 52:46.360
 You know, I get a lot of flack from people saying,

52:46.360 --> 52:47.840
 oh, Bitcoin's so hard to use.

52:47.840 --> 52:49.440
 I've read this article in New York Times saying

52:49.440 --> 52:51.840
 this guy in Silicon Valley lost all of his Bitcoin.

52:51.840 --> 52:54.280
 That's cause he was a moron and didn't care about it.

52:54.280 --> 52:55.640
 This guy lost all this Bitcoin

52:55.640 --> 52:57.800
 because it wasn't worth much 10 years ago.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.480
 And he, you know, he forgot the password.

52:59.480 --> 53:01.600
 But if you're like receiving your remittance

53:01.600 --> 53:04.280
 from a family member, you're not gonna lose the password.

53:04.280 --> 53:05.120
 Right?

53:05.120 --> 53:06.720
 And you trust in the basic intelligence of people

53:06.720 --> 53:09.680
 to figure this out and to innovate and so on

53:09.680 --> 53:10.840
 and figure out.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.640
 We're watching it, man.

53:12.640 --> 53:15.760
 Yeah, you know, I'm, it's kind of funny that

53:15.760 --> 53:19.720
 but people in the United States are not very savvy with money.

53:19.720 --> 53:21.520
 It's exactly the way you're describing.

53:21.520 --> 53:24.560
 It's like when you have very little money,

53:24.560 --> 53:26.880
 you're going to be savvy with money.

53:26.880 --> 53:30.400
 You're going to understand exactly the mechanisms that work

53:30.400 --> 53:33.040
 that are resistant to the corruption that's around you.

53:33.040 --> 53:36.840
 I mean, I remember sort of growing up in the Soviet Union,

53:38.160 --> 53:40.960
 the general bureaucracy and the corruption

53:40.960 --> 53:42.040
 of everything around you.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.960
 You figure out ways around that.

53:43.960 --> 53:46.880
 You figure out ways how to function within that kind of system

53:46.880 --> 53:50.200
 to survive under inflation, under hyperinflation,

53:50.200 --> 53:54.160
 under all like basically being unable to trust any kind of,

53:54.160 --> 53:56.120
 even the police force and all those kinds of things.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.200
 You figure it out.

53:57.200 --> 54:00.480
 And in that same way, perhaps Bitcoin could be

54:00.480 --> 54:05.160
 all the different ways to store and gain Bitcoin.

54:05.160 --> 54:08.120
 These mechanisms could be something that's figured out

54:08.120 --> 54:09.800
 in the third world as opposed to in the United States.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.800
 Oh, I mean, I would say the capital of Bitcoin

54:11.800 --> 54:14.600
 could easily be Lagos and not San Francisco

54:14.600 --> 54:16.960
 in terms of users, in terms of people using it.

54:16.960 --> 54:20.080
 And again, the two use cases as a savings account

54:20.080 --> 54:22.000
 and as an unstoppable payment rail.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.880
 These are the two ones that you should really think about.

54:23.880 --> 54:25.520
 This is how people are using it today.

54:25.520 --> 54:29.640
 Now, when it comes to could it possibly be adopted

54:29.640 --> 54:32.640
 by like a sufficient majority of the population?

54:32.640 --> 54:33.480
 I say yes.

54:33.480 --> 54:36.280
 And it's very similar to the way the mobile phone spread.

54:36.280 --> 54:39.800
 At the beginning, the cell phone was only for rich people.

54:39.800 --> 54:40.800
 It was only for the elite.

54:40.800 --> 54:42.480
 It was huge. It didn't work very well.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.600
 The interface sucked. It was clunky.

54:44.600 --> 54:48.240
 Over time, it got smaller and smaller and cheaper and cheaper

54:48.240 --> 54:49.760
 and easier to use and easier to use.

54:49.760 --> 54:52.000
 And today, everyone benefits.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.800
 So you're gonna watch a similar technology upgrade process

54:54.800 --> 54:55.640
 with Bitcoin.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.360
 Already in the last 10 years,

54:57.360 --> 54:59.480
 Bitcoin has gotten so much easier to use.

54:59.480 --> 55:02.480
 I mean, there are now mobile wallets that are so slick.

55:02.480 --> 55:06.400
 There's one called MoonMUUN Wallet from a team in Argentina.

55:06.400 --> 55:07.960
 And these guys created it

55:07.960 --> 55:09.880
 because they saw their own currency

55:09.880 --> 55:12.680
 devalued like three times in the last 20 years.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.880
 And they've had a hell of a time trying to get their money back

55:14.880 --> 55:16.320
 and forth from different countries.

55:16.320 --> 55:19.040
 So they were like, let's make this easy for people.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.960
 Again, you know, this is the people's money.

55:21.960 --> 55:24.000
 This is something that cannot be controlled

55:24.000 --> 55:25.880
 by governments or corporations.

55:25.880 --> 55:27.800
 And that makes it very powerful.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.880
 And I think it's actually quite exciting

55:29.880 --> 55:31.880
 to be here in the adoption phase.

55:31.880 --> 55:32.920
 In the early days.

55:32.920 --> 55:34.440
 Yeah, man. This is the early days.

55:34.440 --> 55:36.840
 And you also mentioned that sort of Bitcoin

55:36.840 --> 55:40.040
 is the mechanism of a peaceful revolution.

55:40.040 --> 55:44.040
 So it's a way to resist authoritarianism

55:44.040 --> 55:45.120
 in a peaceful way.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.200
 It's ultimately, you know,

55:47.200 --> 55:52.200
 you mentioned sort of politics, information, and money.

55:53.400 --> 55:55.640
 It seems like in the space of money,

55:55.640 --> 55:57.760
 this is one of the peaceful mechanisms.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.760
 It's a way to opt out.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.800
 You can opt out peacefully from the system.

56:03.680 --> 56:05.000
 And yeah, it's beautiful.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.360
 It's beautiful.

56:06.360 --> 56:08.480
 So Bitcoin is currently, by far,

56:08.480 --> 56:12.320
 the most popular sort of dominant cryptocurrency.

56:12.320 --> 56:15.240
 That said, and I look forward to your letters,

56:15.240 --> 56:17.520
 Bitcoin Maximilists.

56:17.520 --> 56:19.840
 That said, you know, Internet Explorer

56:19.840 --> 56:23.960
 was the most popular browser for quite a long time.

56:23.960 --> 56:26.560
 And then other browsers came along

56:26.560 --> 56:30.920
 that outcompeted it like Chrome, Firefox,

56:30.920 --> 56:34.040
 People's Checkout Brave, it's a great browser.

56:34.040 --> 56:36.080
 I think it's my favorite browser at this point.

56:36.080 --> 56:37.800
 Anyway, so why Bitcoin?

56:37.800 --> 56:39.560
 Why not another cryptocurrency?

56:39.560 --> 56:43.400
 If you look in the next 10, 20, 50, 100 years,

56:43.400 --> 56:46.320
 do you think it's possible for another cryptocurrency

56:46.320 --> 56:49.640
 like Ethereum or something that it's not even here yet

56:49.640 --> 56:52.240
 to overtake Bitcoin as a mechanism?

56:53.120 --> 56:57.120
 When you say overtake, what do you mean?

56:57.120 --> 56:58.240
 What do you mean overtake?

56:58.240 --> 56:59.120
 Do you mean number of users?

56:59.120 --> 57:01.360
 Do you mean a price per coin?

57:01.360 --> 57:02.840
 Yeah, the number of users,

57:02.840 --> 57:05.240
 because we're talking about 1%, 2%.

57:05.240 --> 57:10.240
 And if we are serious about this being in the space of money

57:11.760 --> 57:16.760
 as a way to give individuals power,

57:17.040 --> 57:20.320
 fight the centralized powers that use the money system

57:20.320 --> 57:24.680
 and so on, how do we get from 2% to 50%, right?

57:24.680 --> 57:28.000
 To 60% to 80%.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
 That jump, is it obvious to you, not obvious,

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
 but do you think Bitcoin is the way to get from 2% to 50%

57:38.120 --> 57:40.840
 or are there going to be other cryptocurrencies

57:40.840 --> 57:43.080
 that may emerge that get us to 50%?

57:43.080 --> 57:45.240
 No, I mean, Bitcoin is the innovation.

57:45.240 --> 57:48.360
 The innovation is in having the decentralized mint.

57:48.360 --> 57:50.880
 No one can change the monetary policy.

57:50.880 --> 57:52.960
 Everything else is downstream from there.

57:52.960 --> 57:55.320
 In Bitcoin, the mean would be 21 million.

57:55.320 --> 57:57.560
 There's never gonna be any more than 21 million.

57:57.560 --> 58:01.440
 Every other cryptocurrency either has an inflationary policy.

58:01.440 --> 58:03.520
 I mean, there's gonna continue to be more and more of it

58:03.520 --> 58:06.640
 over time or its monetary policy can be changed

58:06.640 --> 58:08.080
 by a small group of people.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.920
 This is vividly on display in Ethereum,

58:09.920 --> 58:11.360
 which is like the second largest

58:11.360 --> 58:14.040
 and second most robust cryptocurrency, right?

58:14.040 --> 58:17.240
 I've talked to senior Ethereum engineers

58:17.240 --> 58:19.480
 over the last couple of weeks trying to figure out

58:19.480 --> 58:21.960
 what is the monetary policy of Ethereum?

58:21.960 --> 58:23.120
 No one can tell me.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.360
 No one knows how much ETH is gonna be minted

58:25.360 --> 58:29.960
 in 2022 and 2023 after they shift to proof of stake.

58:29.960 --> 58:33.200
 I've seen estimates that range from 100,000 to 2 million.

58:33.200 --> 58:34.040
 So at the end of the day,

58:34.040 --> 58:35.720
 you're gonna be trusting a small group of people

58:35.720 --> 58:36.960
 to make those decisions.

58:36.960 --> 58:39.240
 That is what we are escaping with Bitcoin.

58:39.240 --> 58:41.400
 So all these other cryptocurrencies,

58:41.400 --> 58:43.040
 they might have their use cases.

58:43.040 --> 58:44.640
 Virtually all of them are not.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.040
 It's very important for people to know

58:46.040 --> 58:48.520
 that if you take like the 4,500 cryptocurrencies

58:48.520 --> 58:52.760
 on CoinMarketCap, almost all of them are scams straight up.

58:52.760 --> 58:55.760
 Even the ones that have like noble intentions,

58:55.760 --> 58:59.560
 I just don't think are gonna add that much value ultimately.

58:59.560 --> 59:02.200
 I think Bitcoin to me is the innovation

59:02.200 --> 59:05.280
 and that's because it has a monetary policy

59:05.280 --> 59:08.360
 and an issuance schedule that cannot be changed.

59:08.360 --> 59:09.640
 And that's what gets me so excited about it.

59:09.640 --> 59:11.400
 I mean, that's why it's such an important tool

59:11.400 --> 59:12.280
 for human rights.

59:12.280 --> 59:13.480
 Yeah, it's interesting

59:13.480 --> 59:15.280
 because when you grow from 2%,

59:15.280 --> 59:18.440
 when you grow in the number of people using it

59:18.440 --> 59:20.000
 at the scale they're using it,

59:21.880 --> 59:25.440
 it's going to need to be resistant to governments

59:25.440 --> 59:27.560
 and institutions messing with it.

59:27.560 --> 59:32.160
 So it's interesting to see what kind of cryptocurrency

59:32.160 --> 59:33.360
 would be resistant to that.

59:33.360 --> 59:35.920
 Obviously, Dogecoin is gonna win.

59:35.920 --> 59:36.760
 Let's be honest.

59:38.240 --> 59:41.360
 Well, I mean, look, the number two cryptocurrency

59:41.360 --> 59:44.000
 in the world, probably by like how useful it is

59:44.000 --> 59:47.440
 to people is Tether, which is totally centralized,

59:47.440 --> 59:48.960
 has blacklists.

59:48.960 --> 59:52.440
 So I'm not saying there won't be like new digital assets

59:52.440 --> 59:55.640
 that are lumped into this category that have usage,

59:55.640 --> 59:59.240
 but it's not the same innovation as Bitcoin.

59:59.240 --> 1:00:01.280
 It's just sort of building on this idea

1:00:01.280 --> 1:00:03.400
 of like a euro dollar maybe, like a dollar

1:00:03.400 --> 1:00:05.560
 that is minted outside of the control

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.240
 of the US Federal Reserve, right?

1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:08.080
 It would be a euro dollar.

1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:09.600
 So stablecoins are kind of like euro dollars

1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:11.840
 just minted by private actors in a way, right?

1:00:11.840 --> 1:00:13.200
 But they're still tied to the dollar.

1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:14.680
 They're pegged to the dollar.

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:16.320
 They're not escaping the system.

1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:18.160
 Escaping the system is Bitcoin.

1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:20.480
 We aren't reliant on the dollar.

1:00:20.480 --> 1:00:24.160
 We have our own full store value,

1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:26.520
 meaning of exchange, unit of account eventually.

1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:29.480
 And the Bitcoin world will be denominated

1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:30.520
 in different terms.

1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:32.680
 And I think everything else will be tied to it.

1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:33.720
 I really do.

1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:37.720
 It does feel currently like Bitcoin is like pirates

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:38.640
 or something like that.

1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:40.440
 And there's still like the central banks

1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:43.880
 that are like the main navies of the different nations.

1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:44.720
 Yeah.

1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:46.360
 It's just, if you talk about scale.

1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:47.960
 So there's going to be a moment

1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:50.920
 if Bitcoin continues to grow in its impact.

1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:53.360
 When governments are going to seriously contend

1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:55.760
 with what do we do with this?

1:00:56.680 --> 1:00:58.400
 Do you think about those moments?

1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:02.000
 Is Bitcoin, is the cryptocurrency world in general

1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:07.000
 going to be able to withstand the serious legal pushback

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:09.080
 from countries, from nations,

1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:11.560
 especially authoritarian nations?

1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:13.120
 Yeah. So it's been interesting.

1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:16.600
 It's been 12 years, more than 12 years

1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:19.280
 since Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin.

1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:21.400
 And they haven't been able to stop it.

1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:22.600
 They have tried.

1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:23.600
 They have tried a lot.

1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:25.560
 I wrote a long essay for Quillat on this.

1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:28.760
 Like why haven't governments been able to stop Bitcoin?

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:30.080
 And my thesis is essentially

1:01:30.080 --> 1:01:33.080
 that there's been like this mix of different kind of technical,

1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:36.760
 social and economic and political incentives

1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:39.200
 and disincentives that make it very difficult.

1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:42.400
 And I think to me the best way to think about it

1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:44.240
 is that Bitcoin is like a Trojan horse.

1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:47.800
 So just to actually tell that story just a little bit

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:48.760
 because I think it's important

1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:52.480
 to understand the classical mythology tale,

1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:53.800
 I find this very interesting.

1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:54.640
 Of the actual Trojan horse?

1:01:54.640 --> 1:01:55.600
 Of the actual Trojan horse, yeah,

1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:59.040
 which was told in the Aeneid actually by Virgil, right?

1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:00.920
 And the idea was the Greeks had been like

1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:03.520
 trying to take the city of Troy for like a decade

1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:06.360
 at these like impregnable walls and they couldn't do it.

1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:08.520
 And Ulysses and the rest of the Greek army were like,

1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:10.000
 we don't know what to do.

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.880
 So Minerva, the God of strategy and war,

1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:15.920
 kind of like they get this idea from her, I guess,

1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:18.480
 to actually try to use subterfuge and trickery

1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:20.160
 to take over the city.

1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:22.400
 So the idea is, and this was sort of hatched

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:25.480
 by Ulysses to put this horse together

1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:27.360
 that would kind of be like a gift.

1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:31.040
 So the idea was the Greeks just like pretended to leave.

1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:34.720
 They deserted, they left behind one soldier and this horse.

1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:36.200
 And the Trojans looked at it and they were like,

1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:37.480
 what's going on here?

1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:39.600
 And they brought in the soldier and the soldier's like,

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:41.400
 look, they left, they're so sorry

1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:43.520
 for all of the desecration and blood spill.

1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:44.560
 This is their gift to you.

1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:46.960
 It's honoring Minerva.

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:50.080
 It's like this trophy for you guys.

1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:54.120
 And there were actually people inside Troy, Cassandra,

1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:56.440
 a prophet, as well as Lao Kuan, who was like a priest,

1:02:56.440 --> 1:02:58.120
 who said, no, no, no, this is obviously a trick.

1:02:58.120 --> 1:02:59.880
 This is obviously a trick.

1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:01.840
 But they were like dispatched and ignored

1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:04.400
 because the horse was like, it was just like so badass.

1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:07.400
 So the Trojans were like bringing it in the city.

1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:08.840
 So they brought it in themselves.

1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:10.320
 No blood spilled at all, right?

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:11.680
 In the middle of the night, of course,

1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:13.280
 what you realize is the horse was packed

1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:15.240
 with Greek soldiers and they come out and they let the army in,

1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:16.800
 which was like hiding behind an island.

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:21.600
 So this idea that something could be so attractive

1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:23.480
 that you really can't say no, even if you know

1:03:23.480 --> 1:03:26.080
 what's inside of it, is it played in Bitcoin.

1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:29.520
 So like in Bitcoin has this number go up technology, right?

1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:33.720
 It is what we call it in sort of shorthand, NGU, right?

1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:36.200
 But what people don't realize is that NGU

1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:37.600
 is like the Trojan horse.

1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:41.080
 Inside the Trojan horse is FGU, Freedom Go Up Technology.

1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:44.680
 So dictators and rogue regimes and corporations

1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:48.440
 are gonna buy, mine, tax, accumulate this thing

1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:50.560
 because it's the best performing financial asset

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:51.400
 in the world.

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:55.000
 What they don't realize or they're gonna have to ignore

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.720
 is that they're also aiding and abetting

1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:59.080
 this freedom technology, which allows individuals

1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:01.960
 to be sovereign and eventually erodes their power.

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:04.400
 There's no question that rogue regimes and bad actors

1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:06.720
 have already used and will continue to use Bitcoin.

1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:08.400
 The thing is when you think about a North Korea

1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:11.560
 or a Venezuela and that government instructs

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:14.240
 some of its bureaucrats and cronies and officials

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:18.000
 to start stealing Bitcoin or accumulating it or whatever

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.240
 for short term gain to get around sanctions

1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:22.440
 and use it to buy dollars or something like that, right?

1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:24.000
 Which they can't get normally.

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:24.840
 Well, guess what?

1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:26.440
 All those people who the regime has instructed

1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:28.280
 to like figure this thing out and use it,

1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:29.520
 they're all gonna realize, oh my God,

1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:31.240
 this is money the government doesn't control

1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:33.200
 and it's gonna spread like a virus, okay?

1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:35.840
 So this is like the idea of the Trojan horse allegory.

1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:38.280
 I think it's so important and powerful with Bitcoin.

1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:41.400
 All the people talking about Bitcoin today on TV,

1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:43.320
 they don't care about freedom or privacy.

1:04:43.320 --> 1:04:44.960
 They just care about number go up.

1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:47.120
 But what they don't realize is what's concealed within.

1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:49.960
 And that's very, very powerful to me.

1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:52.400
 So the people talking about Bitcoin on TV

1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:53.960
 are maybe investor types?

1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:57.080
 Yeah, professional investors, corporations,

1:04:57.080 --> 1:04:58.200
 and soon governments.

1:04:58.200 --> 1:05:01.000
 I mean, you just had today, this morning on CNBC,

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:04.640
 the leader, the Republican leader

1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:06.720
 of the House of Representatives, a congressman,

1:05:06.720 --> 1:05:09.360
 saying like we need to be pro Bitcoin as a country.

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:12.240
 And the other day, Peter Thiel had a very interesting comment

1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:14.800
 where he was basically like, let's not fall behind China

1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:15.840
 in this race.

1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:19.840
 So you have influential people in our government

1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:22.760
 like sort of posturing for this like, you know,

1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:25.040
 Bitcoin race that's gonna happen in the next 10 years.

1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:26.200
 You're gonna see this.

1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:29.000
 Countries are gonna compete to stack Bitcoin.

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:29.840
 Absolutely.

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:33.280
 So you believe the thing that's shiny and sexy

1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:36.360
 like the Trojan horse is the number go up?

1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:38.080
 It's too hard to ignore.

1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:43.080
 And to define that a little further is meaningless.

1:05:43.400 --> 1:05:45.600
 It does seem like the more people get excited

1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:48.200
 and start using Bitcoin, the more its value grows.

1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:49.200
 So it's just a good.

1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:50.040
 Feedback loop.

1:05:50.040 --> 1:05:51.200
 Yeah, it's a feedback loop.

1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:53.280
 And then the reason you're excited about it,

1:05:53.280 --> 1:05:56.320
 especially is the FG.

1:05:56.320 --> 1:05:57.480
 Yeah, freedom go up.

1:05:57.480 --> 1:06:01.200
 Freedom go up, which is it ultimately gives power

1:06:01.200 --> 1:06:04.000
 to the individuals to decentralize the entire system.

1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:06.840
 Yeah, I mean, like when Tesla stacks Bitcoin,

1:06:06.840 --> 1:06:08.520
 they're just doing that as self interest.

1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:11.080
 They think it's gonna be a good inflation hedge, fine.

1:06:11.080 --> 1:06:13.040
 But what they maybe don't care about,

1:06:13.040 --> 1:06:14.720
 don't realize or they don't need to care.

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:17.960
 I mean, Bitcoin's power is that like co opts people

1:06:17.960 --> 1:06:19.440
 into promoting a freedom tool,

1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:20.520
 even if they don't care about

1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:22.720
 or even if they hate freedom, it doesn't matter.

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:25.560
 So when Tesla stacks Bitcoin and the price goes up

1:06:25.560 --> 1:06:26.840
 and more interest goes up

1:06:26.840 --> 1:06:29.480
 and more people around the world are like, wow, Bitcoin,

1:06:29.480 --> 1:06:31.080
 then more people get involved.

1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:33.760
 Again, more adoption, more price, more developers,

1:06:33.760 --> 1:06:36.400
 better user interface, more privacy tools,

1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:38.040
 more mining, more network security.

1:06:38.040 --> 1:06:39.760
 It's just this like positive feedback loop

1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:40.920
 that continues to grow

1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:43.560
 and it will grow intensely in the next decade

1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:45.120
 as we go through the adoption cycle.

1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:47.120
 And the reason why I'm so excited about this

1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:48.120
 is the human rights world,

1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:50.560
 again, to get back to our previous conversation,

1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:54.520
 is very hard to find people who have the empathy

1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:57.040
 or the altruism to actually make a difference abroad

1:06:57.040 --> 1:06:59.920
 in places like China or Saudi Arabia or North Korea.

1:06:59.920 --> 1:07:01.880
 People are very quick to just like,

1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:04.600
 they'll just quickly toss off the pretty words

1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:05.960
 that they care about human rights.

1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:07.680
 As soon as profits come into play.

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:09.880
 So there's no alignment of incentives, right?

1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:11.320
 The reason why Bitcoin is so powerful

1:07:11.320 --> 1:07:13.040
 is that it aligns the incentives.

1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:15.880
 All of a sudden, they can be as greedy as they want.

1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:18.360
 They are being forced to promote a freedom tool.

1:07:18.360 --> 1:07:19.520
 This I've never seen before

1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:21.640
 and it gives me a lot of like excitement.

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:22.880
 It's very refreshing

1:07:22.880 --> 1:07:25.400
 because we've been laboring in the human rights space

1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:26.680
 and you have to like raise money

1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:28.240
 and it's all like nonprofit work

1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:29.440
 and you're like begging for people

1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:30.840
 to make a difference for you.

1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:33.400
 Here you have this like incredible asset

1:07:33.400 --> 1:07:35.840
 which people will accumulate out of self preservation,

1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:37.160
 self interest and greed.

1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:40.400
 And yet it will strengthen the power of the individual.

1:07:40.400 --> 1:07:42.480
 That is what we need to fight, big brother.

1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:43.720
 That's what we need to fight.

1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:45.800
 Like what I'm scared is happening in China.

1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:48.000
 Like this growing authoritarian state

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.280
 which is powered by big data analysis.

1:07:50.280 --> 1:07:52.000
 This is our way to fight back.

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:56.640
 And it runs on this like really interesting engine again

1:07:56.640 --> 1:07:59.360
 that like takes advantage of our base nature as humans.

1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:01.640
 And I know that it sounds terrible for me to say this

1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:05.400
 but I mean, ultimately we are self interested

1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:08.360
 and it is hard to get people to care about others

1:08:08.360 --> 1:08:10.160
 living a thousand miles away.

1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:13.960
 You know, we are kind of localized in our empathy.

1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:16.760
 Speaking as someone who works to help people

1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:19.160
 who live in like a hundred different countries.

1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:21.360
 It's very difficult to get Americans to care about

1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:23.240
 what's happening in Belarus or in Kashmir.

1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:24.280
 It just is.

1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:25.720
 But guess what?

1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:27.320
 They're gonna definitely care about Bitcoin

1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:29.840
 because they wanna see their net worth go up.

1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:31.920
 They wanna do better for their family, et cetera.

1:08:31.920 --> 1:08:33.680
 They're gonna get into this thing

1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:36.160
 and it's really gonna like make that powerful tool

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:37.800
 for everyone else who's using it.

1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:42.240
 So this interplay dynamic is fascinating to me.

1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:47.200
 Yeah, I have to, I'm somebody who doesn't like

1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:49.440
 their corrupting effects of greed.

1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:53.200
 But it is also human nature.

1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:54.040
 Yeah, I don't like it either

1:08:54.040 --> 1:08:55.880
 but we have to be realists.

1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:57.320
 You have to acknowledge it

1:08:57.320 --> 1:09:00.560
 and then maybe use it for your advantage.

1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:02.080
 And it's not just Bitcoin itself.

1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:04.280
 Like exchanges today are adopting something

1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:05.480
 called Lightning Network,

1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:07.880
 which is a way to scale Bitcoin on a second layer.

1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:09.080
 Much like we had gold bars,

1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:10.520
 which we scaled with paper money

1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:12.200
 and then we had Visa credit cards,

1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:14.760
 which were a way of scaling the paper notes.

1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:16.440
 Bitcoin scales through Lightning Network.

1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:20.200
 It's a private instant globally final settlement network.

1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:22.440
 It's something you all should check out.

1:09:22.440 --> 1:09:24.360
 It's very, very interesting.

1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:25.960
 The exchanges aren't adopting Lightning

1:09:25.960 --> 1:09:27.760
 for its privacy benefits.

1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:29.800
 Like Lightning operates off the chain,

1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:31.640
 meaning surveillance companies can't see,

1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:33.240
 they can't do chain analysis on Lightning

1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:35.200
 because it's on an onion routed second layer

1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:38.640
 kind of that works kind of like the tour project.

1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:40.960
 The exchanges don't care about privacy.

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:43.120
 They're doing it because it reduces fees.

1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:45.040
 Lightning is cheaper and faster.

1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:47.000
 So again, we have this really interesting alignment

1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:48.840
 of incentives where like the freedom tech

1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:50.720
 is being promoted by people who don't,

1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:52.920
 I don't, it doesn't matter what their incentives are.

1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:55.360
 I could care less if they were altruistic or not.

1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:56.560
 And I think this is,

1:09:56.560 --> 1:09:58.720
 and you're gonna maybe see this even in the future.

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:01.600
 There's more things coming in Bitcoin down the pike.

1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:04.320
 Lightning was enabled by an upgrade called Segwit, right?

1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:05.560
 Which took place a few years ago,

1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:08.320
 which was the culmination of the block size conflict.

1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:09.480
 There's another thing coming up

1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:11.360
 called cross input signature aggregation,

1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:15.480
 which may, if it takes effect in the next few years,

1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:18.640
 it may compel exchanges to collaboratively spend

1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:20.000
 all their Bitcoin together in a way

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.200
 that really protects our privacy and fights surveillance,

1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:25.200
 but they're not gonna do it for moral reasons.

1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:26.720
 They're gonna do it because it's gonna save them money

1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:28.280
 and improve their bottom line.

1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:29.680
 Can you speak to that kind of collaborative

1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:31.840
 so that you can have multiple parties

1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:33.240
 in a single transaction kind of thing?

1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:36.440
 Yeah, like, you can do that today, absolutely.

1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:38.200
 It's called the coin join, for example.

1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:40.320
 But right now it's more expensive to coin join at Bitcoin.

1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:42.240
 You have to pay a premium for your privacy.

1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:43.640
 This would flip that on its head

1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:46.200
 and it would basically say, if you have one transaction,

1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:48.560
 hey, pile them all in, have as many parties as you want.

1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:49.520
 The more parties you get in,

1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:51.760
 the cheaper it's gonna be per party, okay?

1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:53.640
 And that's not possible in Bitcoin today,

1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:55.120
 but it might be in the future.

1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:58.400
 But again, the beauty in Bitcoin are these like,

1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:00.680
 these ways that it just aligns human incentives

1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:04.280
 and it aligns our like most base desires and needs

1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:07.840
 and realities with like freedom and privacy.

1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:09.600
 And that I've never seen before.

1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:12.200
 And then that's why I think it's so interesting.

1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:15.320
 So something that, like somebody like Eric Weiss,

1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:16.720
 I actually spoke to this,

1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:19.880
 the idea of blockchain in general.

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:24.840
 From like a 10,000 foot view,

1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:26.960
 the blockchain is a centralized place

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:28.160
 to keep the record of everything

1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:29.180
 that ever happened.

1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:33.040
 And does that concern you?

1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:35.600
 From a privacy perspective, from a control perspective,

1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:38.920
 even though it's managed, especially,

1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:42.240
 given the low frequency of transactions for Bitcoin,

1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:47.240
 you can have a lot of small computers across the globe

1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:50.800
 contain the entirety set of transactions,

1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:52.360
 all of those kinds of features.

1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:54.640
 Does that concern you that there's one place

1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:57.520
 where everything is made public

1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:00.160
 in terms of everything that ever happened?

1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:02.280
 No, and I'll give you two reasons.

1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:05.040
 Number one, the Bitcoin blockchain

1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:07.200
 is ultimately a settlement layer.

1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:10.480
 It's kind of like something like Fedwire in the United States.

1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:13.920
 It's a way for like institutions to settle with each other.

1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:17.200
 That's what I think it's gonna be like in 20, 30 years from now.

1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:18.880
 The average person's never gonna touch

1:12:18.880 --> 1:12:20.800
 the Bitcoin blockchain probably.

1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:22.480
 They're gonna use things like Lightning

1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:24.920
 or unfortunately they may use Bitcoin banks,

1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:26.320
 but they'll either use custodians

1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:29.520
 or they'll use second layer non custodial solutions

1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:30.360
 to interact.

1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:32.240
 The main chain's gonna get very expensive.

1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:34.800
 It's gonna be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars

1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:37.800
 or even more if the dollar starts to weaken

1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:39.760
 to make a transaction on the main chain.

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:43.240
 And that will be reserved for like very large transactions

1:12:43.240 --> 1:12:45.600
 or transactions that need final, final settlement,

1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:46.640
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:53.040
 And I think that that's fine and that's okay.

1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:56.440
 And it's very important that that ledger,

1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:00.280
 that settlement layer be kept by thousands of people

1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:01.240
 around the world.

1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:03.120
 The Bitcoin blockchain is not centralized.

1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:04.680
 It is decentralized.

1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:06.840
 It is run by people like me who run a node at home.

1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:08.160
 I run a personal server.

1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:09.720
 I run the Bitcoin blockchain.

1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:10.560
 No one else.

1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:11.480
 You run it.

1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:12.320
 That person runs it.

1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:13.440
 There's no one in charge.

1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:14.640
 Well, you have a full node?

1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:16.360
 Yeah, I run a full node.

1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:17.200
 It's great.

1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:18.040
 I mean, it's pretty easy, man.

1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:20.160
 You run it and that way you can be sovereign

1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:21.920
 over all of your usage, right?

1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:23.720
 And you can run it on a Raspberry Pi

1:13:23.720 --> 1:13:25.960
 with less than 150 bucks of equipment.

1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:27.560
 And that's so important because again,

1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:30.400
 there is no Amazon web service vulnerability here.

1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:31.240
 That is a problem.

1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:32.080
 And I agree with you.

1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:33.320
 We're trending in a bad direction.

1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:35.840
 We're like, the government could just turn off

1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:37.760
 a big important website or a news source.

1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:38.840
 Well, they can't turn off Bitcoin

1:13:38.840 --> 1:13:40.200
 because it doesn't live on AWS.

1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:41.120
 It lives with us.

1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:42.000
 We are Bitcoin.

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.160
 And I think that that's very, very powerful.

1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:48.520
 And then you can have something like a lightning network

1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:52.560
 where you can escape some of the constraints of the blockchain

1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:54.760
 depending on your needs of the privacy

1:13:54.760 --> 1:13:56.000
 and all those kinds of things.

1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:57.320
 Everything's an engineering trade off.

1:13:57.320 --> 1:13:59.240
 But yeah, you can trade off some of the assurances

1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:02.320
 of the base layer to go into lightning, for example.

1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:04.480
 And there you can get more speed and more privacy.

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:06.880
 And the things that Bitcoin lacks,

1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:09.040
 speed and privacy, for example,

1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:10.560
 you can get on these second layers.

1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:12.520
 So there's all kinds of cool engineering things

1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:14.440
 that people are coming up with.

1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:17.840
 But I also would just say anyone who says the blockchain,

1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:19.640
 like that's a red flag for that person

1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:21.120
 doesn't really know what they're talking about.

1:14:21.120 --> 1:14:25.040
 Like Satoshi didn't use the blockchain in the white paper.

1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:26.920
 Blockchain was a marketing term

1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:30.200
 that people came up with later to try and do this thing

1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:32.960
 that was kind of like it peaked in 2015

1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:35.200
 and it continues to be an issue today

1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:37.520
 of it's blockchain not Bitcoin.

1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:41.120
 And that was like a very corporate kind of social attack

1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:44.240
 on Bitcoin to say we could take this like ledger part

1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:46.240
 of this radical thing that's for criminals

1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:47.320
 and all these bad people.

1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:48.960
 But we could take one part of it out

1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:50.200
 and we could bring it over here

1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:52.880
 and we could make it safe for everybody.

1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:54.760
 The real McCoy's Bitcoin,

1:14:54.760 --> 1:14:57.000
 I mean Satoshi referred to it as a time chain.

1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.360
 I mean really what they're talking about

1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:00.840
 is just these like blocks that are connected chronologically

1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:02.000
 of transactions.

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.520
 It's really not that exciting.

1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:06.760
 The exciting part of Bitcoin is the proof of work,

1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:09.440
 where the transaction processing is done by mining

1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:11.800
 and by energy and by real world expenditures

1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:15.440
 instead of like some central ledger.

1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:18.320
 And when you remove the blockchain from Bitcoin,

1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:22.560
 it's not very, to me it's just not that interesting.

1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:24.840
 I don't know, to me the blockchain and time chain

1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:27.920
 whatever as it philosophically is a pretty beautiful idea.

1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:29.560
 I mean, it's pretty simple,

1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:33.720
 but nevertheless it's beautiful from a big database person.

1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:36.080
 It's an interesting way to store information

1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:39.360
 that especially that's totally publicly accessible.

1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:43.440
 It's, I know that to Bitcoin proof of work

1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:44.760
 is the fundamental idea.

1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:45.600
 Yes.

1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:48.640
 But to cryptocurrency and digital money in general

1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:51.200
 and to money, the blockchain is a really interesting idea

1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:52.040
 to me.

1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:55.320
 The way I think about it is it's kind of, you know, physics.

1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:58.760
 And I like that there's a place that you can rely on

1:15:58.760 --> 1:16:00.560
 that's very difficult to mess with.

1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:03.840
 But it's not though, like it's outside of maybe Ethereum.

1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:06.160
 Every other blockchain is easy to mess with.

1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:09.120
 So you're saying that proof of work is what makes it

1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:10.280
 hard to mess with. Absolutely.

1:16:10.280 --> 1:16:12.000
 Proof of work is the key.

1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:14.080
 And Ethereum is about to leave proof of work.

1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:16.920
 So it's about to go to proof of stake,

1:16:16.920 --> 1:16:18.760
 which is literally the existing system

1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:20.120
 where a small group of people get to decide

1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:21.160
 the monetary policy.

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:23.840
 Yeah, reputation has a lot of value there

1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:25.880
 and that you could be, it could be manipulated.

1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:26.720
 I may sound brutal,

1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:28.960
 but I'm coming at it from a political science perspective.

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:31.800
 For me, it's all about freedom versus dictatorship.

1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:33.840
 And that's why I find it so compelling

1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:36.960
 that regardless of how much power or might

1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:38.720
 or how many armies you have,

1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:40.840
 you can't change the rules of Bitcoin.

1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:43.880
 If you're wrong about Bitcoin,

1:16:43.880 --> 1:16:45.440
 what would that look like?

1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:50.440
 What kind of thing that in 10, 20 years,

1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:53.280
 that you, you're not wrong.

1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:54.680
 Right, it doesn't pan out.

1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:57.040
 It doesn't pan out, but other things

1:16:57.040 --> 1:16:58.320
 that actually make you feel good

1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:01.160
 about all the hard work you've done do pan out.

1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:04.440
 Something you haven't expected, what might that be?

1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:06.800
 Well, as we've talked about my career started

1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:09.240
 in human rights and in promoting individual freedom

1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:10.720
 and fighting authoritarianism,

1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:12.920
 that fight will continue on,

1:17:12.920 --> 1:17:15.200
 no matter what happens with Bitcoin.

1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:17.480
 I think it would be a massive failure

1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:20.520
 and a tragedy if this project like didn't work.

1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:21.360
 The Bitcoin project?

1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:22.840
 Yes, if the Bitcoin project didn't work,

1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:24.360
 we would, it would, honestly,

1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:26.920
 it's one of the only things that gives me hope

1:17:26.920 --> 1:17:28.680
 because it is an effective way to push back

1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:31.520
 against the creeping centralized control.

1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:34.080
 If, for whatever reason, and I can't really see,

1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:35.120
 one of the reasons I'm so into it

1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:37.400
 is I can't really see how it's not gonna work.

1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:41.280
 Again, I think the Trojan horse allegory is too powerful.

1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:43.720
 These big centralized actors are gonna be too greedy

1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:46.000
 and they're gonna want some as opposed to banning it.

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:47.880
 It's way easier for them to buy it than to ban it.

1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:49.320
 I think that's just what's gonna happen.

1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:51.760
 But if, for whatever reason it failed,

1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:53.000
 I would have very little hope left

1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.280
 because really, I mean, the Chinese model

1:17:55.280 --> 1:17:58.680
 of like centralizing all of your data and controlling it,

1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:02.480
 I mean, ultimately is a very, very powerful

1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:03.840
 sort of like arch force.

1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:06.520
 And I would be concerned that that would be

1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:09.320
 all of our sort of destiny.

1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:11.920
 I do have to sort of push back at a style of communication

1:18:11.920 --> 1:18:13.840
 and you're not doing it today.

1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:15.640
 You're being exceptionally eloquent

1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:17.320
 in arguing these ideas.

1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:22.160
 But me, especially just from studying history

1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:23.920
 and being very skeptical from growing up

1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:28.920
 in the Soviet Union, I'm very skeptical

1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:31.240
 and cautious when I see a community of people

1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:34.760
 being very sure of an idea.

1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:36.360
 Doesn't matter what that idea is.

1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:40.000
 And there's a huge amount of certainty around Bitcoin.

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:41.480
 Part of it is an important feature

1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:43.440
 because it's number go up.

1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:47.440
 So far.

1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:50.560
 Number go up is a really important part of the mechanism

1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:55.560
 to make sure that it grows and impact network effects

1:18:55.800 --> 1:18:57.800
 because it's really important to get excited

1:18:57.800 --> 1:18:59.160
 about idea for it to take hold

1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:01.320
 that's the way human nature works and so on.

1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:06.320
 But I also get even something that you mentioned

1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:11.960
 that others may not, if you mentioned blockchain,

1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:16.840
 you're sensitive to the attacks that have been mounted

1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:18.400
 where the word blockchain have been used.

1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:19.360
 People have been fooled.

1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:22.120
 I mean, like in people in the humanitarian sector

1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:23.160
 have been fooled into thinking

1:19:23.160 --> 1:19:24.840
 that some centralized blockchain project

1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:27.360
 is gonna help some refugee all collapsed.

1:19:27.360 --> 1:19:29.920
 There's a huge, it makes me sad

1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:31.600
 that there's a huge number of scams.

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:33.280
 Like, you know what makes me really sad?

1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:35.480
 Then just a tiny little tangent.

1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:37.040
 There's been recently,

1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:38.680
 I guess with the growing platform or something,

1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:41.920
 there's been a bunch of fake Lex Friedman accounts.

1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:42.920
 Yeah.

1:19:42.920 --> 1:19:44.200
 They must have a million.

1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:47.320
 But not only do they do stupid stuff,

1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:49.480
 but they've been messaging people.

1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:51.840
 Oh, to get the Bitcoin and stuff like that, totally.

1:19:51.840 --> 1:19:54.960
 And people write to me and they're saying like.

1:19:54.960 --> 1:19:56.300
 It's tough, man.

1:19:56.300 --> 1:19:57.880
 I think it gets people.

1:19:57.880 --> 1:19:59.280
 I think they click on stuff.

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:01.000
 I think they were not sure.

1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:03.680
 And it makes me think like,

1:20:04.880 --> 1:20:07.360
 people are gullible or not gullible,

1:20:07.360 --> 1:20:11.080
 but like they're just like I am,

1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:12.840
 which is they're like hopeful about the world.

1:20:12.840 --> 1:20:14.200
 They're optimistic about the world.

1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:16.480
 They're almost naive about the evil that's out there.

1:20:16.480 --> 1:20:17.680
 This is what goes wrong with Bitcoin.

1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:18.520
 And I've seen it.

1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:21.120
 People fall for these like,

1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:22.560
 I mean, like in these different countries,

1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:25.040
 I'm trying to like talk to different people about Bitcoin.

1:20:25.040 --> 1:20:27.360
 And like the amount of like MLM schemes,

1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:29.960
 pyramid schemes, Ponzi schemes,

1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:31.240
 they're just so many of them.

1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:34.040
 And there's plenty here too, but like in Zimbabwe,

1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:36.320
 I was talking to this guy who is a reporter

1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:39.840
 who studies the FX like the foreign currency exchange markets.

1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:41.240
 He's just saying one of the main reasons

1:20:41.240 --> 1:20:42.800
 people don't want to get into Bitcoin

1:20:42.800 --> 1:20:44.320
 is because they've been scammed so hard

1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:45.640
 by all these other things.

1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:47.840
 So I would say that that's one way it could go wrong

1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:51.880
 is that like people just continue to be like afraid of it

1:20:51.880 --> 1:20:54.440
 because of things that are like that in the past.

1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:56.480
 Well, it's not just the volatility.

1:20:56.480 --> 1:20:59.200
 It's just the, you know, yeah.

1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:00.760
 If you think it's a pyramid scheme,

1:21:00.760 --> 1:21:02.600
 you're not going to want to get involved.

1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:04.520
 And in some sense,

1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:08.400
 if I were to speak to the Bitcoin Maximus community,

1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:10.360
 it's to maybe ease up on the certainty

1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:13.040
 because that gives me the signal that it's a scam,

1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:13.960
 to be honest.

1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:16.080
 So whenever somebody,

1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:18.320
 whenever there's a lot of people being

1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:23.080
 cultishly excited about something,

1:21:23.080 --> 1:21:24.640
 I start being very skeptical.

1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:27.000
 It's like, you know, I used to like Green Day

1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.200
 before they became really popular.

1:21:29.200 --> 1:21:31.200
 And then the moment they became really popular,

1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:32.040
 I'm like, I don't know.

1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:33.800
 Instead of wearing mascara as I got it,

1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:35.120
 I don't like them anymore.

1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:40.120
 So I got, I'm very skeptical about evangelists of an idea

1:21:40.280 --> 1:21:42.040
 because I think Bitcoin on its own

1:21:42.040 --> 1:21:44.160
 is just a powerful idea that stands.

1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:46.360
 But I also understand that in a world

1:21:46.360 --> 1:21:48.080
 of a lot of competing ideas

1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:50.480
 where there's a lot of scams

1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:53.160
 and a lot of money to be made through those scams

1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:55.840
 that you have to be innovative

1:21:55.840 --> 1:21:57.360
 in the kind of mechanisms you use

1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:00.880
 to break through the scam, the auction of scams.

1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:02.400
 I took this personality test

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:05.280
 and I'm a 99 skepticism.

1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:07.160
 So I was first, sadly,

1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:10.320
 because I was first introduced to Bitcoin in 2013.

1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:12.040
 And I was like, eh, whatever.

1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:15.320
 And it took me four years to actually get into it

1:22:15.320 --> 1:22:16.280
 to go down the rap hole.

1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:17.960
 I didn't really start to grasp it

1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:20.760
 and start getting excited about it until 2017.

1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:24.920
 So I was regrettably very, very skeptical for a long time.

1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:26.640
 And I just thought it was like whatever.

1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:28.240
 So I appreciate that.

1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:30.280
 And you should be skeptical.

1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:33.000
 But ultimately, you gotta believe in things like,

1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:34.000
 I believe in democracy.

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:35.080
 I believe it's good for people.

1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:36.680
 I believe it's better than tyranny.

1:22:36.680 --> 1:22:37.600
 I believe in the internet.

1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:39.960
 I know that we've had issues with centralization

1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:41.800
 of the internet, but I still believe it's better

1:22:41.800 --> 1:22:44.520
 to be connected than to have bridges between us.

1:22:44.520 --> 1:22:45.560
 And I believe in Bitcoin.

1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:49.480
 And to me, it's like a very similar progressive force

1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:50.760
 that we're encountering.

1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:53.960
 But yeah, be skeptical.

1:22:53.960 --> 1:22:57.960
 Nothing will befall you that's bad

1:22:57.960 --> 1:22:59.680
 if you're cautious and skeptical.

1:22:59.680 --> 1:23:02.880
 That's a good mentality to have.

1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:05.280
 One thing we haven't talked about,

1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:07.960
 all the violations of the human rights

1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:11.760
 that authoritarian regimes do,

1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:15.280
 there's not a positive.

1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:18.680
 But you mentioned that nationalism is a drug.

1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:19.640
 Yeah.

1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:22.840
 There's something beautiful about loving your country,

1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:26.960
 having pride in your country, loving the,

1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:30.200
 there's a feeling of belonging.

1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:32.200
 It could be country, it could be tribe,

1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:35.040
 it could be family, that's really powerful.

1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:37.400
 And that speaks to human nature as well.

1:23:37.400 --> 1:23:40.720
 And that can sometimes overpower everything else.

1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:41.560
 Patriotism.

1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:42.800
 Patriotism.

1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:47.000
 And sometimes it can be seen when you study history,

1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:51.880
 when you look at Stalinist, the Soviet Union,

1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:54.960
 or you can even look at Hitler and Nazi Germany,

1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:58.520
 we tend to paint patriotism in a negative light.

1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:00.600
 And then maybe when we look at the United States,

1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:01.800
 but even here in the United States,

1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:06.440
 people often paint patriotism in a bad light.

1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:08.280
 Every time I say, I love America,

1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:12.160
 so as an immigrant, I love this country.

1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:15.040
 It's funny how that's taken as a political statement

1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:20.040
 that people on the right have been more active

1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:22.840
 in saying that they love the country

1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:27.040
 and people on the left have not sort of,

1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:28.760
 it's almost become a weird slogan

1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:31.880
 as opposed to a statement of just love.

1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:35.040
 And I understand that patriotism can be a slippery slope

1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:37.320
 into letting your government,

1:24:37.320 --> 1:24:38.600
 I mean, it's exactly what you're saying,

1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:42.320
 the value of freedom of speech is you hold your government

1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:45.280
 to account for all the ways they mess up.

1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:46.280
 I mean, look, you have patriotism

1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:47.560
 and then you have jingoism, right?

1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:49.840
 It's very important when we stay on the patriotic side.

1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:52.480
 Like as an American, I'm very patriotic in terms of,

1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:55.080
 I love the values that this country was founded on

1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:56.520
 if you read the Bill of Rights.

1:24:56.520 --> 1:24:58.360
 And I love the fact that it was just flexible enough

1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:00.560
 that we were able to change it to grant

1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:03.520
 or at least to try to grant all people the same rights.

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:05.240
 It was not the original plan of the founders, right?

1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:06.480
 It had to be changed.

1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:08.880
 But since then, we've remained,

1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:13.880
 those laws have remained and they're very good.

1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:16.280
 And I'm very proud of that.

1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:19.440
 What I'm not proud of is the jingoistic part of our country

1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:21.600
 where we invade other countries and bomb other countries

1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:23.440
 and not proud of our prison system.

1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:25.240
 I think it's a huge stain on our nation.

1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:26.520
 I'm not proud of a lot of things.

1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:27.880
 So I think you can be patriotic,

1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:30.720
 but you can be critical of your country.

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:32.720
 And that's important.

1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:34.960
 I feel like the jingoistic thing is the thing

1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:36.520
 that we need to watch out for.

1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:39.240
 That's just my own personal take.

1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:42.520
 Out of all the projects that the Human Rights Foundation

1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:45.480
 works on, what's the most important one to you right now?

1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:47.880
 Like that's been occupying your mind?

1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:50.040
 Yeah, I just read again this New Yorker piece

1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:51.800
 that just came out that you should read.

1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:53.200
 It's called Ghost Walls.

1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:57.360
 And it's the story of how the Chinese Communist Party

1:25:57.360 --> 1:25:58.920
 is committing genocide right now,

1:25:58.920 --> 1:26:01.680
 just like other regimes did and the Turks did

1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:04.360
 to the Armenians and the Nazis did to the Jews.

1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:05.960
 And it's happening again right now.

1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:07.040
 We said never again.

1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:08.800
 And that's just not true.

1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:09.760
 We're letting it happen.

1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:11.960
 And again, with the business stuff,

1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:16.000
 like air B&B is like a sponsor of the Olympics, like what?

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.520
 At the individual level, at a business level,

1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:21.800
 how does somebody like me, who's just one little aunt,

1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:24.400
 how does somebody like Elon Musk,

1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:28.800
 who's in charge of 10,000 aunts, fight it?

1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:31.880
 Like how do we push back?

1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:34.160
 A great blueprint is the fight

1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:35.960
 against the South African apartheid.

1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:39.080
 So we did a few events down in Johannesburg.

1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:41.640
 And I've had the pleasure of being able to go

1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:43.600
 to the apartheid museum several times.

1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:45.240
 And it really does a good job of chronicling

1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:46.080
 how they were able to do it.

1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:47.120
 It took a while.

1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:47.960
 There's no doubt.

1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:50.320
 But the way it was done was good.

1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:54.040
 Peaceful action from abroad was very important.

1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:55.600
 So there was like the Sullivan principles.

1:26:55.600 --> 1:26:58.880
 So like you can peacefully protest

1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:02.240
 as a company, particular regimes.

1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:03.840
 And it's very effective.

1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:05.480
 And not just corporations,

1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:08.120
 but like the Olympics is a great example.

1:27:08.120 --> 1:27:09.960
 Like Chinese government should not be able

1:27:09.960 --> 1:27:10.800
 to host the Olympics.

1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:12.040
 The IOC should say no,

1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:14.200
 not until you close down those prison camps.

1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:16.560
 This is a perfect, peaceful way to push back.

1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:17.680
 No one gets hurt.

1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:20.480
 Same thing when we had the Korean Olympics a few years ago.

1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:21.680
 North Korea should not have been allowed

1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:24.680
 any sort of symbolistic kind of hosting rights there.

1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:26.840
 They have prison camps, gulags that we can see

1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:28.800
 from outer space, very clearly.

1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:32.320
 And their regime is the cruelest one on the planet, probably.

1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:34.080
 Why were they able to sit and cheer

1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:37.360
 and get to sort of cohost those at the Olympics?

1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:38.360
 This is spineless.

1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:40.440
 Like the IOC, the Olympics,

1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:43.280
 and major corporations should stand up,

1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:44.720
 especially in the cultural sector

1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:46.000
 where you don't lose anything.

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:49.160
 Like, you know, or you shouldn't have to lose anything.

1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:50.320
 So I think if we look at the way

1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:54.480
 that we forced the apartheid regime out,

1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:57.400
 this international solidarity of musicians, athletes,

1:27:57.400 --> 1:27:59.760
 performers, celebrities is very, very powerful.

1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:02.600
 Unfortunately, today's celebrities are doing the opposite.

1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:04.320
 We just, you know, have this press release

1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:06.080
 go out yesterday about Acon.

1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:08.480
 And he's off whitewashing the crimes

1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:10.520
 of the dictator of Uganda

1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:13.440
 and trying to build a future city there with him.

1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:15.480
 You know, if this was the 1980s,

1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:18.040
 Acon would be raising his fist and saying,

1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:20.120
 we need to, you know, fight the apartheid regime.

1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:21.600
 How do we get back to that?

1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:22.880
 You know, we need to think about that.

1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:25.440
 We have to figure out how to harness celebrities,

1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:27.320
 influencers, and companies,

1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:30.000
 and get them to actually stand up for something for once.

1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:31.440
 I mean, that's something we've lost.

1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:33.840
 We've really had a spine against that.

1:28:34.720 --> 1:28:37.240
 And, you know, we've lost it, you know?

1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:39.240
 And you lose things, you lose them forever.

1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:40.280
 Look at Tibet.

1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:42.560
 Tibet was a big cause for people in the 90s.

1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:44.320
 Used to go to colleges and kids would have

1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:46.040
 the Tibetan flags all over the dorm rooms.

1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:49.560
 It was like, Radiohead would have Tibet on the stage

1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:52.600
 and everybody wanted, you know, free Tibet was a big thing.

1:28:52.600 --> 1:28:53.440
 Well, guess what?

1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:55.240
 Like, we've lost it for some reason.

1:28:55.240 --> 1:28:57.800
 It's not a thing anymore and Tibet has been totally colonized,

1:28:57.800 --> 1:28:58.640
 you know?

1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:01.840
 So I think it's important that we find a way to unlock

1:29:01.840 --> 1:29:05.160
 an interest of in the celebrity classes

1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:08.520
 among athletes, singers, presidents, you know,

1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:11.360
 we need to find a way to punish these people.

1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:15.320
 It's surprising cause we've become more and more connected

1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:17.880
 so we can communicate more effectively at a large scale.

1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:22.560
 And yet we seem to be worse and worse at real activism.

1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:25.320
 It seems like the outrage that's overtaken

1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:28.000
 the communication channels has been very US focused

1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:31.080
 and often more about outrage

1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:34.280
 and less about productive activism.

1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:35.120
 I'm very jaded.

1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:37.680
 I mean, it's very difficult to do these things

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:39.000
 at scale effectively.

1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:40.880
 I do not believe we will be successful

1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:43.440
 in boycotting the Chinese Olympics.

1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:44.720
 We weren't in 2008.

1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:46.800
 I don't think, they're much more evil now

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:49.360
 and I don't think we're gonna be able to do it this time.

1:29:49.360 --> 1:29:51.760
 And again, to go back to the Bitcoin piece,

1:29:51.760 --> 1:29:54.160
 that's why I'm like very interested in this thing

1:29:54.160 --> 1:29:55.960
 because it doesn't require my altruism.

1:29:55.960 --> 1:29:57.360
 It doesn't require some famous singer

1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:00.480
 or some corporation to sacrifice anything.

1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:02.360
 They're literally just gonna follow

1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:04.720
 their own profit seeking self interested motives

1:30:04.720 --> 1:30:06.720
 and they're gonna end up making a stronger

1:30:06.720 --> 1:30:08.640
 human rights tool for other people.

1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:09.840
 Freedom go up.

1:30:09.840 --> 1:30:11.680
 FGU man.

1:30:11.680 --> 1:30:15.240
 Do you think we're, it's kind of a dark question

1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:17.880
 but do you think we're headed towards a war with China,

1:30:17.880 --> 1:30:19.600
 the United States versus China?

1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:20.880
 I hope not.

1:30:20.880 --> 1:30:21.720
 I hope not.

1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:24.720
 In the cyberspace and potentially even a hot war.

1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:26.920
 I think there's too many people with too much money

1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:30.320
 to be lost to go to a hot war on both sides.

1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:32.080
 But eventually we're just gonna,

1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:33.200
 someone's gonna have to stand up.

1:30:33.200 --> 1:30:34.800
 I mean, the subjugation of Hong Kong

1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:36.440
 and the genocide of the Uyghurs

1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:38.120
 and the colonization of Tibet.

1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:39.880
 I mean, Taiwan is the next big thing.

1:30:39.880 --> 1:30:41.840
 I mean, Xi Jinping has made it very clear.

1:30:41.840 --> 1:30:45.080
 You know, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan.

1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:47.720
 So we're gonna have to stand up for Taiwan

1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:49.080
 for different reasons.

1:30:49.080 --> 1:30:51.400
 Both for moral reasons, but also for semiconductor reasons.

1:30:51.400 --> 1:30:53.760
 We need TSMC to be on our side,

1:30:53.760 --> 1:30:55.960
 to not have China take over TSMC.

1:30:55.960 --> 1:30:57.760
 So there's different reasons

1:30:57.760 --> 1:31:00.200
 why we're gonna have to protect Taiwan.

1:31:00.200 --> 1:31:01.960
 And you just hope it's not a hot war.

1:31:01.960 --> 1:31:03.800
 I mean, at this point.

1:31:03.800 --> 1:31:06.600
 Well, but also from inside the governments of China

1:31:06.600 --> 1:31:10.040
 and Russia as well, but China I guess is the powerhouse here.

1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:12.600
 How do these governments get reformed?

1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:14.880
 Is there a hope for them to become democracies,

1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:18.320
 like true democracies, represented democracies

1:31:18.320 --> 1:31:21.040
 and sort of reformed them

1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:26.040
 to be ethical players on the world stage?

1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:27.960
 No empire lasts forever.

1:31:27.960 --> 1:31:30.400
 And it's impossible to predict when these regimes fall.

1:31:30.400 --> 1:31:32.760
 I mean, no one thought the Soviet Union

1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:33.920
 was gonna fall when it fell.

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:38.320
 Like if you study the news and the scholarship of the era,

1:31:38.320 --> 1:31:40.640
 no one knew that the Tunisian government

1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:43.600
 was gonna fall after Muhammad Bozizi lit himself on fire.

1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:46.320
 No one predicted that that would become

1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:49.560
 what we now know as the Arab Spring, right?

1:31:49.560 --> 1:31:52.000
 These things are impossible to predict.

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.040
 And one day the Chinese regime fall.

1:31:54.040 --> 1:31:56.680
 I just, we don't know when.

1:31:56.680 --> 1:31:59.400
 Yes, but and there's quite a few folks

1:31:59.400 --> 1:32:02.560
 who talk about the fall of the American empire.

1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:04.480
 And it also concerns me

1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:06.320
 that we don't know when that might fall.

1:32:06.320 --> 1:32:10.040
 You assume me as a very excited naive American.

1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:11.960
 I'm very excited by this project

1:32:11.960 --> 1:32:15.640
 that I think is the beacon of hope in the world still.

1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:20.640
 But that's probably how you feel before it's the end.

1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:24.680
 It's a...

1:32:24.680 --> 1:32:25.520
 Yeah, the party.

1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:26.340
 You wanna leave the party

1:32:26.340 --> 1:32:28.440
 before it starts to deteriorate.

1:32:28.440 --> 1:32:31.040
 I think America could continue to have

1:32:31.040 --> 1:32:34.480
 like a major, major leadership role for a long, long time.

1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:36.560
 I think certain things we do will become

1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:37.640
 maybe no longer possible

1:32:37.640 --> 1:32:40.040
 in terms of the way we intimidate people on the world stage

1:32:40.040 --> 1:32:43.600
 and especially the way we use our currency as a weapon.

1:32:43.600 --> 1:32:45.800
 I think that that's going to decline over time

1:32:45.800 --> 1:32:48.640
 as we become more of a multipolar world.

1:32:48.640 --> 1:32:50.800
 But I do still believe in America

1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:53.480
 and the values that we're founded on despite all the warts.

1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:56.920
 I do believe in us and I would prefer us absolutely

1:32:56.920 --> 1:32:59.880
 to be the most prominent of the multipolar world

1:32:59.880 --> 1:33:02.240
 vis a vis a regime like Russia or China.

1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:03.680
 Absolutely, there's no question.

1:33:03.680 --> 1:33:05.960
 So we've been talking about states and nations.

1:33:05.960 --> 1:33:09.000
 But can we just briefly talk about Facebook and Twitter

1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:11.680
 and companies that have a huge impact on the world as well.

1:33:11.680 --> 1:33:12.720
 And actually one of the things

1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:15.000
 that make America a great nation is

1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:18.120
 it is the place from which these great companies

1:33:18.120 --> 1:33:18.960
 have sprung up.

1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:22.560
 Is there, from a human rights perspective,

1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:24.800
 is there something that bothers you about Facebook,

1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:26.280
 about these large companies?

1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:29.000
 Is there something we need to fix,

1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:33.520
 something we need to be upset about,

1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:38.520
 fight back on, reform, do some sort of real activism about?

1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:42.480
 I'm very concerned about social media platforms

1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:43.560
 and companies.

1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:45.320
 It almost feels like we're losing the golden age

1:33:45.320 --> 1:33:47.600
 of the internet when we could go online

1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:50.400
 and interact with each other and share

1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:52.360
 and not be worried about censorship.

1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:54.160
 It feels like that was a golden age,

1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:57.000
 like in the late 90s, the 2000s.

1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:59.720
 And now everything is becoming very politicized.

1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:02.080
 And I'm not sure that there's a solution.

1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:05.360
 Like I don't think there's a button we can press to fix it.

1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:08.080
 I'm kind of afraid that this is sort of

1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:12.640
 just what happens when societies digitize.

1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:16.120
 Like I think that certain opinions

1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:19.760
 just become demonized in the sort of,

1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:23.360
 in the room, in the social room

1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:25.480
 that we have on the internet.

1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:28.640
 And I don't know if there's a magical solution there.

1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:31.600
 I do know that there's technological solutions

1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:35.000
 that will allow us to continue to communicate

1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:37.400
 and for creators to reach their audiences

1:34:37.400 --> 1:34:38.840
 without censorship.

1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:41.040
 And that's very exciting.

1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:43.480
 Like right now you could be deplatformed

1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:48.480
 from like whether it's a Patreon or YouTube or whatever.

1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:52.120
 And your bank account can be closed down, right?

1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:55.600
 There are emerging ways that Adam Curry,

1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:57.280
 like the Podfather and a bunch of other people

1:34:57.280 --> 1:34:58.760
 are experimenting with,

1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:01.400
 where you can essentially have your audio podcast

1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:04.920
 across a whole bunch of different platforms.

1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:06.920
 So it's censorship resistant.

1:35:06.920 --> 1:35:10.440
 And then your audience can pay you over lightning

1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:11.520
 in streaming money.

1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:13.720
 Like they can stream you money as they listen.

1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:16.000
 So you're removing the whole advertising piece.

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.320
 You don't need to do advertising anymore.

1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:23.320
 You have this direct relationship with your audience.

1:35:24.800 --> 1:35:27.200
 And this is possible with something like lightning

1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:30.320
 where you can do streaming money that's censorship resistant.

1:35:30.320 --> 1:35:33.720
 And a lot of the people who are building a lightning network,

1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:37.600
 for example, Elizabeth Stark, who started Lightning Labs

1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:40.880
 and has done within her company,

1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:42.640
 the people that work with her

1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:45.240
 have built a huge part of the lightning infrastructure.

1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:48.120
 What animates her is this idea of like,

1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:50.760
 again, artists and creators being able to have

1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:53.960
 that direct ability to reach out

1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:57.120
 and have that peer to peer relationship with their audience.

1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:58.960
 And I'm excited for that.

1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:00.720
 And I do think that's coming,

1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:04.000
 but I am very worried that the golden age

1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:07.080
 of like centralized social media platforms

1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:08.520
 is kind of behind us.

1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:10.080
 And I'm not sure how to fix that.

1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:11.960
 I don't know if that's like a fixable problem.

1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:12.800
 Interesting.

1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:15.640
 I have a hope that it's a fixable problem.

1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:19.520
 I think it's fixable because there's demand for it to be fixed.

1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:20.960
 That's the way I think about it.

1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:22.600
 Well, is Twitter that bad right now?

1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:25.600
 Like, I mean, it's fixable in as much as you can do a verification.

1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:27.600
 So you can give a blue check to someone

1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:29.640
 and then that person is like more credible

1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:31.560
 and they go to the top of the comments.

1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:33.000
 And there's like tweaks you can do.

1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:34.760
 You can continue to improve it,

1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:36.720
 but it's not going to fix the fact that like,

1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:39.480
 Twitter can decide to kick off the president

1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:41.960
 and like a lot of people are going to be upset by that, you know?

1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:45.200
 Like there's ways you can improve the UX over time

1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:46.720
 and they continue to do so.

1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:50.480
 Like Clubhouse is a lot of fun, great phenomenon.

1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:51.880
 So is Twitter's basis.

1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:53.520
 So they continue to iterate,

1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:56.240
 but the censorship to platforming piece,

1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:57.760
 I'm not sure is fixable

1:36:57.760 --> 1:36:59.880
 because if you, I mean, you watch the US government haul

1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:03.880
 these people haul Zuckerberg and Dorsey and whatever

1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:07.080
 in front of Congress, they want more censorship.

1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:11.560
 I mean, our elected leaders want more censorship, right?

1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:16.240
 See, I just believe censorship is a really harsh word.

1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:18.120
 I believe it's possible to create technologies

1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:20.760
 where it's not Twitter doing the censorship,

1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:24.800
 but it's individuals doing their own selection

1:37:24.800 --> 1:37:26.800
 of what they want and don't want to see.

1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:30.160
 So for example, if you get sick and tired of Donald Trump

1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:33.080
 and whatever he says, or you love Donald Trump,

1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:35.400
 you get to select yourself.

1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:39.520
 Like you get to have more control over what you consume.

1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:41.560
 Twitter tries to do that a little bit,

1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:43.240
 but they obviously fail,

1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:48.240
 where ideas infiltrate our view that we,

1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:52.640
 that like misinformation spreads really fast

1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:54.800
 and conspiracy theories spread really fast

1:37:54.800 --> 1:37:57.760
 to where the immune system that Twitter has created

1:37:57.760 --> 1:38:02.280
 to try to censor conspiracy theories and misinformation

1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:07.280
 is overfiring and you're now censoring too many people.

1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:11.880
 So that, it's exactly the same intuition as you said before.

1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:14.600
 If the state is doing it, in this case,

1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:16.520
 Twitter is kind of the state,

1:38:16.520 --> 1:38:18.560
 it's not going to work out well.

1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:20.920
 But if you give power to the individuals

1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:24.120
 to do this sort of the, not even censorship,

1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:28.760
 but incentivization and deaccentivization

1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:33.760
 of great thoughtful content and terrible low effort content,

1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:38.840
 then I feel like that's going to create a system

1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:41.400
 where there's going to be a much more open discourse

1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:44.240
 of ideas, dangerous ideas, difficult ideas,

1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:48.280
 controversial ideas, and people in a decentralized way

1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:50.440
 will be able to use their own intelligence

1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:53.440
 to select content, to share content, spread content.

1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:55.480
 Let's keep it simple.

1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:58.640
 Let's look at one example, Twitter and Jack Dorsey.

1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:00.440
 And I think it's quite clear

1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:02.840
 that what he believes is the solution

1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:04.680
 is as you're kind of hinting at

1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:09.080
 a more kind of like regionalized system,

1:39:09.080 --> 1:39:12.480
 which is not have one, or we call federated system, right?

1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:13.920
 Which does not just have like one company

1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:16.560
 in charge of everything, but there's an open protocol.

1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:18.760
 And then there's like different instances, right?

1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:21.880
 So Twitter make, you know, Jack's dream for Twitter

1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:24.080
 is that Twitter is this open protocol

1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:25.720
 that the Russian government can use

1:39:25.720 --> 1:39:26.880
 and the Chinese government can use

1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:28.040
 and the Iranian government can use

1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:29.080
 and the American government can use.

1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:31.400
 And then Twitter as a company is going to use too.

1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:32.880
 And you as the customer decide

1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:35.080
 which implementation you want to join.

1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:36.480
 And there's going to be different censorship

1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:39.760
 on each instance or each federation,

1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:43.480
 but the protocol itself would be like untouchable.

1:39:43.480 --> 1:39:45.920
 This is kind of like the idea behind the internet, right?

1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:48.080
 There's like different parts of the internet

1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:50.960
 that are censored, but like at the very bottom

1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:53.080
 of the very bottom of the backbone of it,

1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:56.440
 it's like this globally connected,

1:39:56.440 --> 1:39:58.800
 relatively unstoppable thing, right?

1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:00.400
 So I think that's a pretty good vision.

1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:01.640
 And Twitter's working towards that

1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:04.080
 with the blue sky initiative.

1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:06.480
 We'll see, I'm a little skeptical that it like works out

1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:08.920
 because I've used, I use mastodon for example.

1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:13.160
 Mastodon is an example of a federated social media.

1:40:13.160 --> 1:40:15.200
 Now it's ruled by a benevolent,

1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:17.760
 each instance is ruled by a benevolent dictator.

1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:20.440
 It's just like I happen to like this one, so I know.

1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:24.200
 So rather than trust one dictator, Twitter,

1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:27.040
 you could choose which dictator do you want to trust?

1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:28.720
 And that's kind of the federated model.

1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:30.800
 And maybe we had that way, but you lose things.

1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:33.520
 When it's federated, you lose the UX,

1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:35.960
 you lose the slickness and the feel

1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:38.720
 and all the millions of dollars they spend on developers.

1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:41.240
 Like mastodon is like not anywhere close to

1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:43.200
 as nice to use as Twitter.

1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:45.440
 So I feel like it's again, it's this trade off

1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:47.360
 that we make with everything where it's convenience,

1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:50.040
 comfort, speed versus privacy and freedom, right?

1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:52.360
 It's very hard to have something that gives you both.

1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:53.200
 I don't know.

1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:55.320
 I think, yeah, it is a trade off.

1:40:55.320 --> 1:40:56.320
 Have you used one of these things

1:40:56.320 --> 1:40:57.160
 that you feel like is good?

1:40:57.160 --> 1:40:57.980
 I have not.

1:40:57.980 --> 1:40:58.820
 The federator.

1:40:58.820 --> 1:41:00.720
 They're not, they're not, but the federator,

1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:03.160
 I don't think it's a good,

1:41:03.160 --> 1:41:05.840
 I think it requires genius, it requires skill,

1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:08.680
 it requires great design to come up with a way to,

1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:12.720
 there's a Pareto front here.

1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:15.880
 There's a right way to hit that trade off.

1:41:15.880 --> 1:41:19.680
 And I honestly think there's the UX,

1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:23.640
 the experience should be centralized,

1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:26.200
 should be designed by the company.

1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:30.080
 But the data and like a lot of stuff

1:41:30.080 --> 1:41:33.120
 that could be used to violate your basic rights

1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:34.520
 should be owned by the individual.

1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:36.800
 And I think there's a way to decouple those,

1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:41.800
 like create an incredible experience to where you go there

1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:46.160
 and you enjoy the market where you can share your data

1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:49.080
 and have complete control over it and always have,

1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:51.800
 I mean, there's a lot of basic UX ideas.

1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:53.880
 Like just as an example,

1:41:53.880 --> 1:41:58.680
 I think there should always be in everything you design

1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:00.360
 a one button that's always there

1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:03.760
 that says, forget I ever existed.

1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:06.440
 Delete everything you know about me.

1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:09.840
 And maybe it's one button that you click

1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:11.600
 and it asks, are you sure?

1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:13.400
 And you have to be able to say yes.

1:42:13.400 --> 1:42:15.600
 Like that's a feature that's fundamental

1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:17.840
 to a good social network, I believe.

1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:20.680
 Like currently social networks,

1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:23.400
 first of all, most of them don't allow you to do that.

1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:25.840
 They don't make it transparent how much data they had,

1:42:25.840 --> 1:42:27.040
 who they shared it with.

1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:29.160
 And they also make it exceptionally difficult

1:42:29.160 --> 1:42:30.280
 to delete accounts.

1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:33.240
 So like that's a very basic starting point.

1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:38.120
 But that having that button means that you have control

1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:39.880
 but that's step one of the control.

1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:42.640
 There's a transparency of knowing exactly

1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:45.760
 when what data is being shared about you,

1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:48.440
 how much data is already being recorded about you.

1:42:48.440 --> 1:42:50.040
 All that is transparency.

1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:53.800
 And I believe that's a really good business model

1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:56.040
 because when there's transparency and control,

1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:59.040
 people would be willing to give over a lot more data

1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:01.640
 as long as they know what they're given over,

1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:03.800
 as long as they know what they can delete.

1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:06.320
 Yeah, I guess maybe you're more optimistic

1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:07.640
 about people caring.

1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:10.960
 I feel like not so few people actually care

1:43:10.960 --> 1:43:12.400
 about their privacy and freedom.

1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:15.280
 I've just watched everybody give it up, you know?

1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:16.560
 But we'll see.

1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:18.800
 I guess just to bookend that,

1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:19.720
 I think we're at this moment

1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:21.440
 where obviously the centralized platforms

1:43:21.440 --> 1:43:23.360
 are just so much easier and better to use

1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:27.000
 and to strike it out and adventure out

1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:30.240
 and use like a federated instance

1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:31.520
 or something even like Keybase,

1:43:31.520 --> 1:43:33.080
 which is kind of like a cool encrypted way

1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:35.320
 to like have group chats.

1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:37.760
 It just requires like a lot of your time

1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:39.480
 and a lot of people don't have that time.

1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:40.480
 But I will say one thing,

1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:42.000
 like I do think there is this future

1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:46.320
 where we do go into more of this like try,

1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:49.720
 it's called a tribal model or like tribes,

1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:52.000
 which is this social environment

1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:57.000
 being built on top of lightning by an app called Sphinx.

1:43:57.360 --> 1:43:58.680
 And the idea is like kind of like,

1:43:58.680 --> 1:44:00.120
 it's like a decentralized Slack,

1:44:00.120 --> 1:44:02.080
 like you have your Slack instance,

1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:04.000
 which has like a bunch of people in the community

1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.400
 and you have different ways to message each other

1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:07.400
 and it's all encrypted.

1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:10.240
 And then it has like plugins for like things like Jitsi

1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:11.120
 instead of Zoom.

1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:14.600
 So like an open source encrypted video messenger,

1:44:14.600 --> 1:44:17.320
 it has ways to like plug in the content you wanna get

1:44:17.320 --> 1:44:21.520
 from like different platforms that you follow

1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:23.080
 like podcasts, things like that.

1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:25.400
 And again, it allows you to pay those people directly

1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:27.560
 in a censorship resistant private way.

1:44:27.560 --> 1:44:29.640
 So it's really nice to connect to the lightning network.

1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:30.480
 Yeah.

1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:31.320
 So it's all sort of built on lightning

1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:33.640
 but the idea you can think about it is like,

1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:36.840
 you're slowly starting to build up the idea of a WeChat

1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:38.520
 but with freedom principles.

1:44:38.520 --> 1:44:40.720
 Cause right now WeChat's like the king of convenience

1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:42.640
 and comfort, but of course it's feeding all that data

1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:44.760
 to the big brother and the surveillance state.

1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:47.080
 And then we have like our own versions over here

1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:50.120
 in America that are not quite as convenient or amazing,

1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:53.360
 but like we give up slightly less privacy and freedom.

1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:55.920
 But this thing has a lot of promising features to it.

1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:56.840
 It's worth checking out.

1:44:56.840 --> 1:44:58.120
 It's very like early days.

1:44:58.120 --> 1:45:00.400
 Like it feels like, I mean, I was pretty young

1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:03.320
 but it feels like the 90s in the internet.

1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:06.600
 Like it has that feeling where you know it's rough

1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:08.960
 around the edges, but you can feel the magic.

1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:09.920
 It's pretty cool.

1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:13.000
 I'm very much like with Steve Jobs on this.

1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:16.160
 I think the founding principles are exceptionally important

1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:17.320
 but at the end of the day,

1:45:17.320 --> 1:45:22.320
 the design of how sleek it is, how easy it is to use.

1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:26.760
 And that's not just like pretty icing on the cake.

1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:30.080
 That is, the icing is the cake.

1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:32.120
 Because like how easy it is to use,

1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:34.280
 how natural it is, it's the Trojan horse thing.

1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:37.880
 Like you don't get, it has to be pretty and shiny.

1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:41.760
 It has to fundamentally connect to the basics of human nature

1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:45.560
 which is what is pleasant to use, what feels good to use.

1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:48.960
 You have to trick people into eating a broccoli.

1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:51.640
 You have to put like a delicious whatever on it.

1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:54.000
 Well again, PTP is the kind of paint to use, right?

1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:55.040
 If you want privacy.

1:45:55.040 --> 1:45:56.440
 Yeah, so signals are not great.

1:45:56.440 --> 1:45:57.280
 It's way better.

1:45:57.280 --> 1:45:59.760
 I mean, and it's way better than it was five years ago.

1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:02.720
 And it's not quite as good as like,

1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:04.080
 not quite as seamless, right?

1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:07.520
 It's like a WhatsApp yet, but it's almost there.

1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:08.920
 And they were able to do it.

1:46:08.920 --> 1:46:12.800
 And you're gonna see that with Bitcoin wallets as well.

1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:14.200
 I mean, they're almost there.

1:46:14.200 --> 1:46:17.520
 They're like, if you use like a moon wallet is like,

1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:19.560
 I mean, it's so cool looking and it's so seamless

1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:21.160
 and they've spent so many hours thinking

1:46:21.160 --> 1:46:23.840
 about your experience, we are getting there.

1:46:23.840 --> 1:46:25.880
 Whereas 10 years ago is like impossible to use.

1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:27.640
 One of the things that Signal doesn't have,

1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:32.640
 and I believe these kinds of applications need to have

1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:35.520
 is like a, I hate the term, but killer app,

1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:40.160
 which is like a dumb, but very viral

1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:42.440
 and popular reason to switch.

1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:45.800
 It, I didn't see exactly, I mean, I've been using Signal,

1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:50.800
 but I haven't seen a, you know, a big reason to.

1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:52.640
 Well, you're on it, man.

1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:53.480
 To switch.

1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:54.320
 I mean, the reason.

1:46:54.320 --> 1:46:55.800
 No, but I haven't switched everything to it.

1:46:55.800 --> 1:46:57.040
 You know what I mean, like a.

1:46:57.040 --> 1:47:00.240
 Yeah, the Exodus to Signal was in January.

1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:04.320
 They had a huge user surge for two main reasons.

1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:06.800
 One, hilariously enough, of course, was Elon tweeted,

1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:09.320
 like you should use Signal, right?

1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:10.680
 Which is not insignificant.

1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:13.160
 And then the other one was that like WhatsApp

1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:14.960
 changed kind of some of its terms of service

1:47:14.960 --> 1:47:17.240
 and like, you know, announced to all of its users

1:47:17.240 --> 1:47:20.040
 in this little pop up that it was going to be sort of

1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:21.720
 like changing the way I handled your data.

1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:23.120
 That spooked a lot of people.

1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:25.520
 So these two things really combined

1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:28.720
 and tens of millions of people in the following weeks

1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:30.640
 between January and February joined Signal.

1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:33.840
 It's like, it really has had it stay in the sun.

1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:36.640
 And they are like frantically trying to keep up with it.

1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:41.120
 Like, and it's really nice to see that this encrypted

1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:44.480
 messaging service, which prioritizes your privacy

1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:48.360
 in a way that, you know, the government, again,

1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:50.480
 may know like the metadata, but doesn't know exactly

1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:53.000
 what you're saying unless they can get your hands on your phone.

1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.120
 I think that's very, very powerful.

1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:55.520
 So it can be done.

1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:57.440
 I don't want to be too jaded here.

1:47:57.440 --> 1:47:58.360
 I think it can be done.

1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:02.240
 Yeah, I think I think we can fight back and I think we can make

1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:04.560
 it continue to make the digital communications tools

1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:09.120
 and platforms in a way that really benefits us.

1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:12.600
 Yeah, I'm not sure, but I'm hopeful as well.

1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:16.840
 I'm hopeful that if you look at the trend of technologies,

1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:19.560
 they ultimately are ones that respect privacy,

1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:23.640
 respect security and basic human rights.

1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:25.840
 I mean, that's at least the hope.

1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:28.480
 So Gary Kasparov, I'm Russian.

1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:30.880
 He means a lot to me on a personal level.

1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:34.320
 He is the chairman of Human Rights Foundation.

1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:37.000
 What does Gary have to do with anything?

1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:39.200
 What's your relationship like with him?

1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:40.800
 Do you like chess?

1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:45.040
 What are his specific focuses and ideas around the HRF?

1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:47.400
 Can you just speak to it in general?

1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:50.040
 Yeah, so our chairman at the Human Rights Foundation

1:48:50.040 --> 1:48:53.960
 was Voslov Havel, who of course was like

1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:57.160
 the famous Czech democracy activist,

1:48:57.160 --> 1:48:59.760
 who helped lead the Velvet Revolution

1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:03.640
 and then ended up becoming the first democratically elected

1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:07.880
 leader of the Czech Republic after the Soviet Union fell.

1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:10.400
 He passed away in 2011.

1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:14.120
 And it was very difficult to find a replacement

1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:16.360
 because who can fill Havel's shoes, you know?

1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:19.080
 But if one could, it would be Gary, right?

1:49:19.080 --> 1:49:21.400
 So we really tried to get Gary to join

1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:22.560
 and thankfully he agreed.

1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:25.360
 And we've had an amazing relationship with Gary

1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:26.200
 over the years.

1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:29.040
 I mean, he's been relentless in his pursuit of freedom.

1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:30.520
 I mean, he could have retired

1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:32.560
 and taken his career in a different direction

1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:34.040
 and he could be hanging out with Putin

1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:36.440
 and have a pleasure yacht and all kinds of stuff.

1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.680
 But he decided to risk it.

1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:41.320
 And if you actually study, like the times

1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:43.680
 when he was running for president in Russia,

1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:46.160
 Amash Gessen followed him around in The Man Without a Face.

1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:48.320
 It's a great book about Putin.

1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:50.360
 There's a fabulous chapter

1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:52.520
 where she's following around Gary when he's campaigning.

1:49:52.520 --> 1:49:54.720
 And I mean, he risked a lot.

1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:56.240
 I mean, he can't go back to Russia anymore.

1:49:56.240 --> 1:49:58.080
 He gave up his country.

1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:01.120
 He's given up a huge amount to be able to speak his mind

1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:03.880
 and to have this dream, this beautiful vision

1:50:03.880 --> 1:50:05.240
 of a free and democratic Russia.

1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:06.600
 He really believes in it.

1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:07.640
 It's been a great experience.

1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:09.520
 I work very closely with Gary.

1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:11.080
 We talk a lot.

1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:13.280
 We do different things around the world together.

1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:15.480
 He's come out to a lot of events

1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:18.040
 in different cities around the world.

1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:19.560
 And he's been a very active chairman.

1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:20.880
 This isn't some figurehead.

1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:23.480
 He's very involved and it's really, really great.

1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:26.480
 I mean, everything he's involved with is,

1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:28.920
 you know, as one journalist who attends our events says

1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:30.280
 when he walks in the room, you know,

1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:33.600
 the average IQ of the room goes up pretty significantly.

1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:36.520
 I'm not a big chess person, unfortunately.

1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:38.280
 So I have not been able to connect with him on that.

1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:40.000
 But I think he probably would prefer it that way.

1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:41.320
 You know, all he gets is people

1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:43.400
 who want to talk to him about chess, you know?

1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:46.040
 So here we can talk about kind of human rights strategy

1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:48.080
 and like how to, you know,

1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:50.840
 improve our fight against dictators.

1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:53.800
 But he really, you know, has that moral clarity

1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:57.400
 that I really appreciate, so.

1:50:57.400 --> 1:51:00.200
 Yeah, he has a lot of fascinating ideas

1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:02.120
 about artificial intelligence as well.

1:51:02.120 --> 1:51:02.960
 Absolutely.

1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:07.960
 He's opened my eyes a little bit to the state of Russia today

1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:14.280
 because I've read most books on Putin in the English language

1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:16.760
 in sort of trying to understand things.

1:51:17.760 --> 1:51:21.440
 And I try to look at it from a historical perspective,

1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:24.680
 like almost like we're living 100 years from now

1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:28.200
 and I look at Putin as a important figure

1:51:28.200 --> 1:51:30.160
 in the history of human civilization

1:51:30.160 --> 1:51:31.720
 and study it in that way.

1:51:32.920 --> 1:51:34.600
 I think the way Gary looks at it,

1:51:34.600 --> 1:51:37.440
 he probably doesn't appreciate me looking at the way I do.

1:51:37.440 --> 1:51:42.440
 But the way he looks at it is we can still change

1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:48.160
 the direction of Russia and we individual human beings

1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:52.000
 and we communities and we nations can take actions,

1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:55.160
 have policies that can change the direction of Russia.

1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:58.640
 To me, I take a sort of going to the library,

1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:01.920
 passive view of studying fascinating aspects of Russia.

1:52:01.920 --> 1:52:05.680
 To me, Russia means like most of my family suffered

1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:09.640
 through the Soviet Union and I see beauty in suffering,

1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:12.640
 the poetry, the music, the stories.

1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:16.120
 And just there's so much love that emerged from the pain

1:52:16.120 --> 1:52:18.680
 that I just enjoyed the music of that.

1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:23.680
 But to Gary and to many activists that I speak to,

1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:28.720
 they love not just the Russia of the past.

1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:32.240
 They have a vision and a hope for Russia of the future

1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:35.080
 and they criticize me a little bit

1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:38.080
 for being a little bit too scholarly about the past

1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:40.880
 and ignoring the future and there's something to that.

1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:45.640
 So he opens my eyes to look to the future of Russia.

1:52:45.640 --> 1:52:48.960
 Gary and a handful of other Russian activists

1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:51.880
 that we work closely with, including Vladimir Karamurza,

1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:54.160
 who again, I mean, it's just incredibly heroic.

1:52:54.160 --> 1:52:56.640
 The man has survived two poisonings by Putin.

1:52:57.520 --> 1:52:59.120
 They like to say that, you know,

1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:02.920
 Russians will bring democracy to Russia on their own terms.

1:53:02.920 --> 1:53:04.160
 They don't need our help.

1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:07.040
 This is what Vladimir especially says.

1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:10.000
 But what he does say is that we should stop propping up Putin.

1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:13.440
 Like that's kind of his, stop kind of legitimizing him.

1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:15.120
 That's kind of his argument.

1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:17.440
 He's like, we don't need your foreign interference.

1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:18.400
 We don't need your ideas.

1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:19.760
 We don't need your help.

1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:20.880
 We can do it on our own,

1:53:20.880 --> 1:53:24.320
 but please stop propping up our illegitimate ruler.

1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:26.240
 That's kind of like his point of view,

1:53:26.240 --> 1:53:30.320
 which I think is interesting and fair.

1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:35.040
 Yeah, let me just say on one unrelated comment,

1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:37.920
 some people criticize me and others

1:53:37.920 --> 1:53:40.640
 like Joe Rogan for giving people a platform.

1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:46.080
 I think it's some cases that's applicable,

1:53:46.080 --> 1:53:51.000
 but I think in most cases, knowledge is power.

1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:54.000
 And there's no such thing as giving a platform.

1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.680
 The conversation just shines a light

1:53:56.680 --> 1:53:58.640
 as long as you shine the light well.

1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:02.040
 And as long as in shining the light

1:54:02.040 --> 1:54:03.360
 and having the conversation,

1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:05.880
 you reveal something fundamental

1:54:05.880 --> 1:54:08.600
 about the state of things, about the people,

1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:11.920
 whether that's Putin or some of the other controversial figures

1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:16.080
 that have come up in possible future conversations.

1:54:16.080 --> 1:54:20.080
 So I don't like this kind of platforming idea.

1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:22.240
 I think conversations save us.

1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:24.240
 They don't destroy us.

1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:26.560
 Yeah, I mean, that's journalism though.

1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:29.400
 I mean, that's very different from advocacy

1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:33.000
 or strategic thinking about what to do with Russia.

1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:35.240
 Absolutely, yeah, we should interview everybody

1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:37.960
 and everybody should know exactly what they're thinking.

1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:41.000
 Yeah, but journalism to me has become a dirty word

1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:46.200
 because it's done so poorly by so many people that...

1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:51.240
 You know, I listen to sometimes certain programs

1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:54.880
 like, I don't know, like Meet the Press

1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:58.000
 and the Fox Sunday program, just certain things,

1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.840
 just to tune in and see what different news medias

1:55:01.840 --> 1:55:02.840
 are paying attention to.

1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:07.480
 And the kind of interviews they do is like five minutes at most,

1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:08.800
 but usually it's like one minute.

1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:13.200
 It's these quick clip things and it's very gotcha

1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:16.160
 and they're looking for ways to sort of grab

1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:17.560
 almost that misstatement.

1:55:17.560 --> 1:55:19.840
 They want to catch you off guard.

1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:23.800
 They want to ask the quote, like the harsh question,

1:55:23.800 --> 1:55:27.360
 but without any of the dance of conversation

1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:29.040
 that reveals the truth.

1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:33.600
 You know, you can't just get to the truth by asking it.

1:55:33.600 --> 1:55:36.360
 You have to sneak up on it.

1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:38.760
 And I think that's an art form.

1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:42.400
 And I think that art form involves long form conversation.

1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:44.760
 Like I'm a huge believer in just,

1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:46.360
 I guess that's what's called, I don't know,

1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:47.960
 in depth journal or whatever,

1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:51.120
 like where you spend months or years on a story.

1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:54.320
 And in that same way, I think of long form conversation

1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:57.880
 is like you spend many hours and you spend months and years

1:55:57.880 --> 1:55:59.440
 preparing for those many hours,

1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:04.360
 but like it's not this like short form trying to get

1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:07.240
 the most controversial little tidbit of a story out.

1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:10.680
 And unfortunately, the funding mechanisms behind journalism

1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:14.080
 are such that they are incentivized clickbait journalism

1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:18.600
 versus like in depth long form digging for the truth.

1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:20.280
 I have a conflicted relationship with journalism

1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:23.040
 because to me, press freedom is so core.

1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:26.040
 And independent journalists around the world are so brave,

1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:28.760
 especially in countries like Russia or China, et cetera.

1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:33.480
 And really good journalism is still something I absolutely,

1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:34.760
 I love and I enjoy.

1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:36.960
 Like this, especially like to say again,

1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:38.840
 this New Yorker piece on what's happening to the Uyghurs

1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:40.640
 is incredibly well reported.

1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:42.960
 However, on the other hand,

1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:46.720
 you have in this sort of clickbait journalism

1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:48.200
 that's all about sensationalism

1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:49.800
 and that gets used as a tool.

1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:53.880
 I mean, whether it be against things like privacy

1:56:53.880 --> 1:56:54.920
 or Bitcoin or whatever,

1:56:54.920 --> 1:56:57.480
 you have like people who sensationalize

1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:00.600
 and it gets used in the service of the surveillance state,

1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:02.200
 the war on terror, whatever.

1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:03.800
 You know, it's a difficult,

1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:05.960
 but you know, I think journalism is essential

1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:07.120
 to a free society,

1:57:08.160 --> 1:57:11.160
 but it can sometimes be,

1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:13.240
 it can wear my patients thin sometimes.

1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:16.720
 Like, to be honest, it's been a huge burden on me personally,

1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:18.920
 if I were to just turn this into a therapy session

1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:20.160
 for a brief moment.

1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:22.400
 When I look at people, when I interact with people,

1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:24.920
 I'd like to see the best in them.

1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:28.840
 And the burden that weighs heavy on me

1:57:28.840 --> 1:57:30.720
 is sometimes people I talk to me

1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:34.000
 may not be good people.

1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:34.840
 And I don't,

1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:39.080
 I'd love to, I believe everybody has good in them.

1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:41.320
 And I try to focus on that.

1:57:41.320 --> 1:57:43.400
 The burden that weighs on me

1:57:43.400 --> 1:57:47.000
 is sometimes that there may be conversations

1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:48.680
 where that's irresponsible.

1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:53.680
 Where I have to also call people out.

1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:55.560
 I have to do enough of the hard lifting

1:57:55.560 --> 1:57:58.040
 and the hard work of knowing exactly

1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:01.560
 what are the bad things that that person has done.

1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:05.280
 And I also have the responsibility to call them out on it.

1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:07.960
 And that's for me personally, just an unpleasant feeling.

1:58:07.960 --> 1:58:10.120
 That's what we're speaking to journalism.

1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:12.920
 Like, I think journalists are too much focused

1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:16.920
 on the bad things a person has done,

1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:21.720
 and not enough on the digging into the full complexity

1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:25.280
 of the human being behind all the things that have been done.

1:58:25.280 --> 1:58:29.400
 But at the same time, I can't have a conversation

1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:31.840
 with Hitler and...

1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:33.680
 Not ask about the prison camps.

1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:34.600
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:36.200
 Yeah, no, so from the human rights perspective,

1:58:36.200 --> 1:58:37.840
 one of our programs is we like,

1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:41.920
 we try to go after people who do like PR for dictators.

1:58:41.920 --> 1:58:45.280
 So like, and a lot of people do,

1:58:45.280 --> 1:58:47.040
 like PR firms in Washington get hired

1:58:47.040 --> 1:58:48.200
 by all these dictators.

1:58:49.560 --> 1:58:51.680
 And they make a lot of money to make them look good.

1:58:51.680 --> 1:58:53.800
 It's called whitewashing or putting lipstick on a pig

1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:55.400
 or whatever you want to do.

1:58:55.400 --> 1:58:57.560
 Astroturfing is like the fake social media accounts

1:58:57.560 --> 1:58:59.880
 to make it seem like you're popular.

1:58:59.880 --> 1:59:01.280
 But whitewashing is a huge issue.

1:59:01.280 --> 1:59:06.280
 So I think it's completely fair to interview like dictators

1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:07.520
 and stuff like that.

1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:09.240
 Amunpour does a pretty good job.

1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:10.680
 She's really good.

1:59:10.680 --> 1:59:13.920
 She makes sure that there's no messing around.

1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:16.560
 I mean, her interviews of Mussolini recently,

1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:18.440
 the Ugandan dictator was very good.

1:59:18.440 --> 1:59:20.000
 I mean, she's basically like, well,

1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.640
 like, why are you rigging another election?

1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:24.040
 Please tell us, you know?

1:59:24.040 --> 1:59:26.000
 And she's fearless and she's good.

1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:27.840
 And that can be a helpful thing to have

1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:30.000
 on YouTube as a resource.

1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:35.000
 But it's quite clear when it descends into a PR session.

1:59:35.320 --> 1:59:37.440
 And you just have to be like very careful about it.

1:59:37.440 --> 1:59:41.520
 Like Asma al Asad, the wife of the butcher in Syria,

1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:43.520
 you know, was like profiled by Vogue.

1:59:43.520 --> 1:59:45.560
 And it was this whole rows in the desert things,

1:59:45.560 --> 1:59:46.680
 a bunch of nonsense.

1:59:46.680 --> 1:59:50.320
 Terrible, terrible, terrible, total propaganda.

1:59:50.320 --> 1:59:54.960
 But a like honest interview where you're asking

1:59:54.960 --> 1:59:58.680
 about all the tough questions, very important.

1:59:58.680 --> 2:00:01.040
 So I think it's just a matter of like content.

2:00:01.040 --> 2:00:03.840
 Is there a good resource to study whitewashing?

2:00:03.840 --> 2:00:07.360
 Like to know what manipulative PR looks like?

2:00:07.360 --> 2:00:10.880
 I think you just, if you've researched the topic,

2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:13.280
 you should know it inside you because it would be,

2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:15.560
 is there anything you're afraid to ask?

2:00:15.560 --> 2:00:17.960
 That would make sure you're asking all the questions.

2:00:17.960 --> 2:00:19.960
 As long as you're asking all the questions that you have,

2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:20.960
 you're good.

2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:23.240
 But if there's something you're afraid to ask,

2:00:23.240 --> 2:00:25.880
 then maybe you're self censoring, right?

2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:26.720
 That's a good way.

2:00:26.720 --> 2:00:29.000
 It takes us back to that like,

2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:31.760
 what is it that litmus test about?

2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:33.760
 Is your country a lot to have a gay pride parade?

2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:34.600
 Yeah.

2:00:34.600 --> 2:00:35.920
 Yeah.

2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:38.760
 So there's like obvious things that might be on your mind

2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:39.960
 that you just want to ask.

2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:41.960
 And you shouldn't, you shouldn't run from them.

2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:43.520
 As long as you feel like you're a free person

2:00:43.520 --> 2:00:46.080
 when you're interviewing, I think you're good.

2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:47.840
 That's beautifully put.

2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:52.440
 Are there books, technical fiction, philosophical,

2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:56.400
 that had an impact on your life that you recommend?

2:00:56.400 --> 2:00:59.960
 Or even resources like blogs, films?

2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:03.160
 I have four books I'll briefly mention.

2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:05.720
 Number one is The Fear.

2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:07.760
 The Fear had a deep impact on me.

2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:09.480
 The Fear was written by Peter Godwin.

2:01:09.480 --> 2:01:12.520
 It's about the systematic dismantling of Zimbabwe

2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:14.040
 under Robert Mugabe.

2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:15.160
 Peter Zimbabwin.

2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:17.440
 And it is a riveting book.

2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:18.640
 I think everyone should read it

2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:21.520
 because it helps you understand what it's like to go through,

2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:24.440
 not just authoritarianism, but also hyperinflation.

2:01:24.440 --> 2:01:26.920
 And I mean, really, you know, at the end of the day,

2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:30.280
 what The Fear describes is how Mugabe took this country

2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:33.680
 in the 1980s and he actually brought it back in time

2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:36.440
 to the 1920s in terms of infrastructure,

2:01:36.440 --> 2:01:38.520
 literacy rates, health rates, all these things.

2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:40.480
 He stole so much from the people.

2:01:40.480 --> 2:01:44.280
 And it's a heartbreaking book, but it's a very important book.

2:01:44.280 --> 2:01:49.240
 And it's a way to do excellent, excellent journalism.

2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:51.080
 So The Fear is a good one.

2:01:51.080 --> 2:01:52.640
 And it's a personal story?

2:01:52.640 --> 2:01:53.840
 Absolutely, yeah.

2:01:53.840 --> 2:01:57.000
 Because he was, it's part of his whole family story

2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:00.360
 and he's in there, he's interviewing people personally.

2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:02.280
 So I would say that one.

2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:03.880
 Is it also connected and starting to interrupt?

2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:06.360
 Is it from the inflation perspective?

2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:09.880
 Is it a good study of hyperinflation and the effects?

2:02:09.880 --> 2:02:16.760
 Does Bitcoin at all come as a discussion of money?

2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:19.960
 Does that come into the, or is it purely the experience

2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:22.320
 of inflation as almost a symptom of an authoritarian government?

2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:23.400
 A little bit, a little bit.

2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:24.400
 I would say it's not deep.

2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:26.720
 I have another book on that, which I'll recommend in a second.

2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:32.000
 But I would just say that it's a very powerfully written book

2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:36.880
 about how society can basically deteriorate

2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:39.440
 and how you can lose everything.

2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:41.280
 The second book is, I just mentioned it,

2:02:41.280 --> 2:02:43.640
 but The Man Without a Face by Masha Gessen.

2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:46.040
 Incredible book about modern Russia and Putin.

2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:47.600
 Just a masterpiece.

2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:48.560
 So that one is.

2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:50.800
 Could be one of your favorite books about Putin and Russia?

2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:51.760
 That one's the best.

2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:53.400
 I mean, she's just so fearless.

2:02:53.400 --> 2:02:54.000
 Incredible.

2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.680
 She interviews Putin in the book at the end.

2:02:56.680 --> 2:02:59.000
 It's really good.

2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:02.920
 Third one is a fiction book called The Mandibles,

2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:04.760
 written by Lionel Shriver.

2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:06.160
 This one's good, it's a good gift book.

2:03:06.160 --> 2:03:07.960
 It's funny, it's dark, it's witty.

2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:12.000
 But it's about the United States losing its status

2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.880
 as the reserve currency and going into hyperinflation.

2:03:14.880 --> 2:03:17.000
 And what's interesting is that the characters in the book

2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:19.200
 map where we are today.

2:03:19.200 --> 2:03:20.560
 The book itself is about the late,

2:03:20.560 --> 2:03:22.440
 I think it's the late 2020s.

2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:24.440
 And we have a populist president who

2:03:24.440 --> 2:03:27.760
 decides to announce that the United States is basically

2:03:27.760 --> 2:03:28.920
 going to default on its debts.

2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:31.920
 And the rest of the world comes up with a new currency.

2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:33.440
 And everybody switches to that one.

2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:36.000
 And the dollar overnight becomes worthless.

2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:39.520
 And all these economists are saying, no, it's fine.

2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:41.560
 Inflation won't be a problem.

2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:44.960
 And there's this one character who's an economist.

2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:47.160
 And he's basically, he gets to the point

2:03:47.160 --> 2:03:50.160
 where he's living as a refugee in Prospect Park in Brooklyn.

2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:52.280
 And he's still saying everything's fine.

2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:54.080
 So it's dry, it's witty.

2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:57.000
 But it's also about the surveillance state.

2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:59.280
 It's about centralization of power.

2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:00.240
 It's really good.

2:04:00.240 --> 2:04:03.640
 So The Mandibles, I would highly recommend.

2:04:03.640 --> 2:04:06.520
 So those three books, and then on the topic of Bitcoin,

2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:07.760
 because we talked about it a lot,

2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:09.920
 I would just say that my portal into Bitcoin

2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:13.040
 was The Internet of Money by Andreas Antonopoulos.

2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:13.640
 Oh, wow.

2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:16.240
 And I did it by audiobook.

2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:19.080
 And I just think this is an important one for people

2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:23.200
 to start with, because he goes through all the main concepts,

2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:27.120
 whether it be proof of work or how the network functions.

2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:29.960
 But he does it in a way that's extremely engaging

2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:31.480
 and really fascinating.

2:04:31.480 --> 2:04:34.440
 And it really just sparked my curiosity.

2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:37.080
 Is it discussed in the technical sides

2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:38.120
 or also the philosophical?

2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:40.440
 Because a lot of people mention the Bitcoin standard

2:04:40.440 --> 2:04:43.440
 as the philosophical entry into the whole Bitcoin world.

2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:44.800
 Very different from the Bitcoin standard.

2:04:44.800 --> 2:04:47.560
 It's more for the average person.

2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:49.080
 It's not a history book.

2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:50.760
 It's a collection of his talks that he gave

2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:52.400
 over two or three years.

2:04:52.400 --> 2:04:54.040
 It's not very technical.

2:04:54.040 --> 2:04:56.480
 It's very approachable.

2:04:56.480 --> 2:04:57.760
 And some of it might be dated now,

2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:00.240
 because it's like 2015, 2016.

2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:01.520
 But I mean.

2:05:01.520 --> 2:05:03.320
 It's great to hear a shout out for Andreas,

2:05:03.320 --> 2:05:06.400
 because he seems to be one of the seminal figures

2:05:06.400 --> 2:05:10.240
 to make Bitcoin ideas accessible.

2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:11.400
 Oh, Andreas is the goat.

2:05:11.400 --> 2:05:12.440
 He's the goat.

2:05:12.440 --> 2:05:13.440
 Andreas is the goat.

2:05:13.440 --> 2:05:14.200
 Andreas is the goat.

2:05:14.200 --> 2:05:15.480
 I know a lot of people have issues

2:05:15.480 --> 2:05:18.720
 with some of his more recent work, but Andreas is the goat.

2:05:18.720 --> 2:05:19.800
 He's the reason I'm in Bitcoin.

2:05:19.800 --> 2:05:21.560
 I mean, he's the reason I'm in Bitcoin.

2:05:21.560 --> 2:05:22.920
 That's fascinating.

2:05:22.920 --> 2:05:27.760
 And it's funny to watch the Bitcoin Maximus immune system

2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:30.280
 also attacking him.

2:05:30.280 --> 2:05:33.600
 And this whole feedback mechanism is working together.

2:05:33.600 --> 2:05:34.440
 It's fascinating.

2:05:34.440 --> 2:05:36.440
 Well, I probably consider myself a maximalist,

2:05:36.440 --> 2:05:38.520
 but I really like Andreas.

2:05:38.520 --> 2:05:40.200
 So I think there's room for nuance.

2:05:40.200 --> 2:05:42.120
 There's room for nuance in this world.

2:05:42.120 --> 2:05:43.840
 I'm glad to hear that.

2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:46.560
 If people are fascinated by your work,

2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:51.040
 what is the way to get more of Alex?

2:05:51.040 --> 2:05:54.720
 So two years ago, I came together with seven other people

2:05:54.720 --> 2:05:55.560
 from around the world.

2:05:55.560 --> 2:05:57.440
 And we wrote a book in a book sprint.

2:05:57.440 --> 2:05:58.520
 We lived in a house for four days.

2:05:58.520 --> 2:05:59.640
 We wrote a book together.

2:05:59.640 --> 2:06:00.320
 It was really cool.

2:06:00.320 --> 2:06:02.840
 It's like a design sprint, but we did it in book format.

2:06:02.840 --> 2:06:07.560
 And my coauthors are from Nigeria, Venezuela,

2:06:07.560 --> 2:06:10.800
 the Philippines from former Soviet Union from all over.

2:06:10.800 --> 2:06:12.320
 And it's called The Little Bitcoin Book.

2:06:12.320 --> 2:06:14.560
 And I'm still proud of it.

2:06:14.560 --> 2:06:15.480
 It's 100 pages.

2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:17.440
 It's something you give to somebody who knows nothing

2:06:17.440 --> 2:06:18.480
 about the topic.

2:06:18.480 --> 2:06:20.000
 And it's not a technical book.

2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:23.960
 It's about the sort of social political aspect of it.

2:06:23.960 --> 2:06:26.280
 Like, why is it important for you, for your finances,

2:06:26.280 --> 2:06:28.920
 for your freedom, for your future?

2:06:28.920 --> 2:06:32.720
 And we've translated it into a lot of languages by now.

2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:35.520
 I think English, Spanish, and Portuguese are for sale.

2:06:35.520 --> 2:06:38.360
 And LittleBitcoinBook.com, you go buy it.

2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:42.760
 But we've made it as a free PDF in Mandarin, Hindi,

2:06:42.760 --> 2:06:47.800
 Punjab, Korean, Uyghur, which I was really excited about,

2:06:47.800 --> 2:06:49.360
 Arabic, Farsi.

2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:50.880
 And I mean, it spreads, man.

2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:52.120
 It's been really, really cool.

2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:54.520
 So I'm proud of that.

2:06:54.520 --> 2:06:58.680
 I also made a video that did very well for Reason magazine

2:06:58.680 --> 2:07:00.560
 called Why Is Bitcoin Protecting Human Rights

2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:01.640
 Around the World?

2:07:01.640 --> 2:07:02.520
 It's five minutes.

2:07:02.520 --> 2:07:04.840
 And I feel like I tried to boil everything

2:07:04.840 --> 2:07:08.880
 that I want to tell you into this five minute video.

2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:10.440
 So there's that.

2:07:10.440 --> 2:07:11.480
 Would recommend that.

2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:15.640
 And then if you're interested in the why

2:07:15.640 --> 2:07:17.840
 have governments not stopped it, which I think

2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:20.120
 is really intriguing, that I wrote this long essay

2:07:20.120 --> 2:07:25.000
 in Quillette in February called Why Haven't Governments

2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:26.040
 Banned Bitcoin?

2:07:26.040 --> 2:07:28.680
 And maybe that'll be a helpful guide to some folks.

2:07:28.680 --> 2:07:30.440
 Is it speaking to the Trojan Horse idea

2:07:30.440 --> 2:07:32.880
 that there's something enticing about it?

2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:34.720
 Yeah, at the end, it does get into that.

2:07:34.720 --> 2:07:37.080
 But it really also just kind of goes through, technically, why

2:07:37.080 --> 2:07:39.000
 is it hard to do a 51% attack?

2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:42.080
 Like, if a government wanted to, could it really

2:07:42.080 --> 2:07:43.360
 get all that equipment?

2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:44.680
 There's a semiconductor shortage.

2:07:44.680 --> 2:07:45.800
 Like, it can't.

2:07:45.800 --> 2:07:49.160
 There's certain things that stop governments from doing it.

2:07:49.160 --> 2:07:51.800
 And same thing with this idea of a 60102,

2:07:51.800 --> 2:07:56.920
 which would be based on the idea of the executive order 6102,

2:07:56.920 --> 2:07:59.760
 which is from 1933 when FDR made holding gold

2:07:59.760 --> 2:08:01.120
 illegal in the United States.

2:08:01.120 --> 2:08:03.880
 The idea is that banks would go around now with governments

2:08:03.880 --> 2:08:05.600
 and try to steal everybody's Bitcoin.

2:08:05.600 --> 2:08:08.440
 Well, in Bitcoin, we have a practice

2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:11.520
 called Proof of Keys Day every January 3,

2:08:11.520 --> 2:08:14.160
 which is coinciding with the launch of the Bitcoin blockchain,

2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:16.320
 where we all withdraw our keys from exchanges

2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:17.760
 and we'd be sovereign users.

2:08:17.760 --> 2:08:20.280
 What we are doing is we are preparing for a 6102 attack,

2:08:20.280 --> 2:08:22.240
 which will one day probably come, right?

2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:26.640
 So the essay just goes through all of the possible attacks.

2:08:26.640 --> 2:08:28.480
 And it runs through the ones that happened,

2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:29.800
 like the Chinese and Indian governments,

2:08:29.800 --> 2:08:31.400
 the two largest governments in the world,

2:08:31.400 --> 2:08:34.560
 both tried to attack Bitcoin by banning their citizens

2:08:34.560 --> 2:08:36.400
 from exchanging fiat for Bitcoin.

2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:37.160
 It didn't work.

2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:38.480
 Interest instead exploded.

2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:42.560
 It's like the Barbara Streisand effect, where

2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:46.360
 by making something public and saying, you shouldn't do X,

2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:50.920
 it actually increases attention about X a lot more, right?

2:08:50.920 --> 2:08:53.560
 So I think there's a lot of interesting game theory

2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:54.680
 there that people would enjoy.

2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:58.120
 Do you think, are you seriously concerned

2:08:58.120 --> 2:09:01.640
 about this kind of thing where the idea is a sovereignty

2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:06.040
 and that Bitcoin espouses would actually one day be tested?

2:09:06.040 --> 2:09:09.080
 Do you have a legitimate concern?

2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:12.280
 Because you said one day very well might.

2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:15.080
 Do you think it might go down?

2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:18.400
 First of all, Bitcoin has been attacked, again, many times.

2:09:18.400 --> 2:09:22.280
 And we talk about the, you spoke about this with Nick Carter

2:09:22.280 --> 2:09:26.120
 on your show, the sort of protocol wars or conflict

2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:26.840
 or whatever, right?

2:09:26.840 --> 2:09:29.640
 And Bitcoin almost died a whole bunch of times during that

2:09:29.640 --> 2:09:30.800
 and ended up surviving.

2:09:30.800 --> 2:09:31.360
 Oh, wow.

2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:32.880
 I didn't know how bad the blockchain was.

2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:34.600
 Oh, it got really bad.

2:09:34.600 --> 2:09:38.080
 It was sort of a very existential threat.

2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:39.680
 And Bitcoin survived.

2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:42.520
 And that's why I'm so intrigued by it,

2:09:42.520 --> 2:09:46.440
 is that it basically survived an attack

2:09:46.440 --> 2:09:48.200
 in an environment several years ago

2:09:48.200 --> 2:09:50.960
 when Bitcoin was much more vulnerable than it is today.

2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:53.080
 It survived an attack by a conglomeration

2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:55.960
 of Chinese billionaires, Silicon Valley corporations,

2:09:55.960 --> 2:09:59.360
 and a ton of people who owned the majority of the hash rate

2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:00.920
 and all this infrastructure.

2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:03.080
 They had 83% of all the hash rate,

2:10:03.080 --> 2:10:04.720
 and they couldn't get what they wanted.

2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:06.080
 And that was so intriguing to me.

2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:08.320
 Like, why didn't it, why didn't it get killed?

2:10:08.320 --> 2:10:10.640
 So as Nick said, I think you should read

2:10:10.640 --> 2:10:12.920
 The Block Size War, which is a book

2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:14.960
 that you can get on Amazon by Jonathan Beer.

2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:17.320
 Really good, kind of like, really important

2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:20.720
 to understand the scaling conflict

2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:24.280
 and the different visions of what Bitcoin should be.

2:10:24.280 --> 2:10:25.920
 And again, people like me believe

2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:28.640
 it should be a freedom tool, not like a payments technology

2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:29.720
 for retail.

2:10:29.720 --> 2:10:32.240
 And I'm glad it worked out the way it did,

2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:34.040
 because it almost didn't.

2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:38.280
 Do you think humans civilization will destroy itself?

2:10:38.280 --> 2:10:42.800
 So if we think about all the threats facing

2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:45.920
 human civilization, nuclear war,

2:10:45.920 --> 2:10:48.800
 natural or engineer pandemics,

2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:51.920
 you know, we talk about human rights violations.

2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:55.360
 We talk about authoritarian governments

2:10:56.480 --> 2:10:58.480
 taking control of the money supply.

2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:01.080
 But do you have great, grander concerns

2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:02.960
 for the future of human civilization?

2:11:04.040 --> 2:11:05.400
 Do you have hope for us becoming

2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:08.520
 a multi planetary species? Yeah, I mean,

2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:11.600
 I guess long term we'd want to decentralize, right?

2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:12.920
 We don't want a single point of failure.

2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:14.120
 In the physical space.

2:11:14.120 --> 2:11:16.560
 The Earth is a single point of failure.

2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:18.600
 But no, I mean, you look at all this kind of like

2:11:18.600 --> 2:11:22.160
 space fiction and I mean, who would want to live on Mars,

2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:23.720
 man? It's like a freaking desert.

2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:24.920
 I mean, the Earth is so beautiful.

2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:27.040
 I hope we can save it, you know?

2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:28.480
 It's just so gorgeous.

2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:30.120
 When you look at the Earth compared to any other

2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:32.560
 like exoplanet or whatever you look at it,

2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:34.360
 I mean, the Earth is so spectacular

2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:36.200
 and wondrous and singular.

2:11:36.200 --> 2:11:39.560
 I think we've got to do everything we can to save it here.

2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:40.400
 That's funny.

2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:43.680
 I mean, I sure a lot of people would have said that

2:11:43.680 --> 2:11:47.520
 about Europe before the explorers ventured out

2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:51.440
 Columbus and the rest on to the unknown.

2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:54.560
 The thing about human nature is that we are explorers too.

2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:55.400
 We are.

2:11:55.400 --> 2:11:58.440
 Some small fraction of us are insane enough

2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:01.840
 to explore in the most dangerous grounds.

2:12:01.840 --> 2:12:03.800
 And I'm pretty sure there's quite a few people

2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:06.760
 that would love to take the first step on Mars,

2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:10.400
 the first few steps on Mars in the harshest of environments,

2:12:10.400 --> 2:12:14.000
 even when the odds of survival extremely low.

2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:17.600
 And I'm thankful for those people because I sit back

2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:19.800
 and drink my vodka back here on Earth

2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:23.480
 and enjoy good friendships because I think ultimately

2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:27.680
 that step to Mars is going to be a first step

2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:32.520
 into a multi, into exploring and colonizing

2:12:32.520 --> 2:12:33.960
 the rest of the galaxy.

2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:36.000
 Mars might be a harsh environment,

2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:41.000
 but maybe space is not like other planets,

2:12:41.240 --> 2:12:44.400
 other exoplanets, but also forget planets,

2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:48.280
 just creating colonies that float about in space.

2:12:48.280 --> 2:12:50.760
 There's exciting technologies that were yet to be discovered,

2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:52.760
 yet to be engineered and built

2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:55.520
 that I think require that first painful step.

2:12:55.520 --> 2:12:58.080
 Like, yeah, the journey of a thousand miles

2:12:58.080 --> 2:12:59.080
 starts with one step.

2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:00.760
 I think Mars is that first step.

2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:04.360
 Yeah, no, I was born the day before the Challenger blew up

2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:07.600
 and it was always so tragic for me to look back on that

2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:10.120
 because that really altered our arc

2:13:10.120 --> 2:13:11.640
 in terms of space exploration.

2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:14.080
 If that had not happened, we'd be in a very different arc

2:13:14.080 --> 2:13:17.520
 and I do respect and admire people pushing for exploration,

2:13:17.520 --> 2:13:20.320
 but at the same time, I just want to recognize

2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:23.120
 that we know how unique Earth is

2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:27.800
 and I do think we got to do everything we can to protect it.

2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:31.600
 But I think you avoid answering the question

2:13:31.600 --> 2:13:33.760
 if we're going to destroy ourselves.

2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:38.040
 Oh, yeah, I guess if we do not, okay, fine.

2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:40.440
 If we do not decentralize properly

2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:45.440
 out into different physical spaces, probably, I guess, yeah.

2:13:45.720 --> 2:13:47.840
 And then, I mean, do you have concerns

2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:49.160
 that are immediately facing you?

2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:53.840
 So not in terms of the injustices on the world,

2:13:53.840 --> 2:13:55.160
 but nuclear war?

2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:57.160
 Yeah, look, I'm a lot more concerned

2:13:57.160 --> 2:13:58.800
 about what's happening right now.

2:13:58.800 --> 2:14:01.720
 Like, what is destroying ourselves?

2:14:01.720 --> 2:14:03.920
 If you were to go and see what's happening

2:14:03.920 --> 2:14:07.440
 in Xinjiang or North Korea right now or Eritrea,

2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:10.320
 that is destroying ourselves and it's already happened.

2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:13.120
 So I guess that's why I said, yes.

2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:14.760
 I mean, if you don't decentralize

2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:18.360
 and power is completely under one person,

2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:20.680
 life is destroyed as we know it.

2:14:20.680 --> 2:14:23.960
 And you don't have to go into science fiction

2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:28.160
 to know what a totalitarian hellscape dystopia is.

2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:29.720
 There's several that exist already.

2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:33.080
 And, you know, let's try to like help those people

2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:36.160
 at the same time as we're trying to like push out into space

2:14:36.160 --> 2:14:38.040
 would be my like counter, I guess.

2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:39.160
 Yeah, I agree with you.

2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:41.240
 In my mind, just sort of destruction

2:14:41.240 --> 2:14:43.120
 and suffering are next door neighbors.

2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:46.160
 So we don't need to destroy all of human civilization

2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:50.280
 if much a large fraction of it lives in conditions

2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:51.720
 that we would equate to suffering.

2:14:51.720 --> 2:14:54.120
 That's not a good world.

2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:58.080
 Is there advice that you would give

2:14:58.080 --> 2:15:01.320
 to young people today about life, about career,

2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:05.040
 about how they can help a world where 53%

2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:09.360
 are living under authoritarian governments,

2:15:09.360 --> 2:15:12.280
 but in general, a world that's full of injustice

2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:13.920
 but also full of opportunity?

2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:17.000
 Just thinking about my own upbringing,

2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:18.520
 I went to a public school here

2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:21.440
 and we never learned about money.

2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:23.240
 It was never part of our curriculum.

2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:27.720
 Even personal finances was not part of our curriculum.

2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:29.000
 You could take like an optional course

2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:31.000
 to learn about like business or something.

2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:34.280
 And I think that that would be really valuable

2:15:34.280 --> 2:15:36.840
 as a young person or as a teenager

2:15:36.840 --> 2:15:40.640
 to start incorporating into your children's lives

2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:43.120
 is like a curiosity about what is money.

2:15:43.120 --> 2:15:44.480
 I think it would be very healthy

2:15:44.480 --> 2:15:47.320
 regardless of what path that takes them down

2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:48.960
 because we don't think about it enough

2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:51.360
 either from an administrative sort of personal finance thing

2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:55.680
 about like responsibility or more fundamentally

2:15:55.680 --> 2:15:57.440
 like what is it and who creates it,

2:15:57.440 --> 2:15:58.800
 where did it come from?

2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:00.200
 Both of those things are very important.

2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:01.800
 So my advice to a young person would be

2:16:01.800 --> 2:16:03.560
 to get to the point where you feel like

2:16:03.560 --> 2:16:06.160
 you can answer the question, what is money?

2:16:07.480 --> 2:16:10.000
 So you ultimately see money as a kind of power

2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:13.560
 and freedom and a mechanism of suffering.

2:16:13.560 --> 2:16:15.360
 It's so core to everything.

2:16:15.360 --> 2:16:17.800
 The United States, whether you wanna call it

2:16:17.800 --> 2:16:20.880
 the tax amount or conna, the empire, the hyper power,

2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:22.840
 whatever you wanna call this moment in time

2:16:22.840 --> 2:16:24.240
 where the US is dominant around the world,

2:16:24.240 --> 2:16:28.200
 it is because of the fact that we have this petrodollar system

2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:31.320
 where we are able to force the Saudis

2:16:31.320 --> 2:16:36.080
 and other oil producing nations to sell their oil in dollars.

2:16:36.080 --> 2:16:39.920
 That is really inescapable, inseparable from our power.

2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:42.240
 And that's very rarely talked about.

2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:44.040
 And it's very important to understand.

2:16:44.040 --> 2:16:46.200
 So yeah, young people can start thinking

2:16:46.200 --> 2:16:48.040
 about that stuff, it'd be good.

2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:50.320
 I remember being, it sounds silly to say,

2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:52.760
 but I remember being really uncomfortable

2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:55.440
 that I was dependent on my parents

2:16:55.440 --> 2:16:58.800
 at a young age for financial.

2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:01.400
 You need to be 18 to have a bank account or whatever.

2:17:01.400 --> 2:17:03.440
 One of the people that we supported at Ahraf

2:17:03.440 --> 2:17:05.560
 through our, we do software development funding

2:17:05.560 --> 2:17:07.800
 for people in Bitcoin, open source projects.

2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:10.800
 And one of the guys we funded is this very young,

2:17:10.800 --> 2:17:13.280
 smart sort of prodigy, he's like 17.

2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:14.600
 But one of the reasons he got into Bitcoin

2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:16.640
 was because he wanted to have control of his money

2:17:16.640 --> 2:17:18.080
 when he was like 14.

2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:21.400
 I mean, if you think in history, people who invented

2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:24.680
 all kinds of incredible contributions to science or math,

2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:27.480
 I mean, a lot of them did it before they were 15.

2:17:27.480 --> 2:17:30.400
 So think about that maturity that is capable

2:17:30.400 --> 2:17:31.560
 and possible in many people.

2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:34.320
 Like I've participated in some of the years ago,

2:17:34.320 --> 2:17:36.840
 some of the sort of selection processes

2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:38.960
 for like the Teal Fellowship, which is like really amazing.

2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:41.280
 Like these people who are 14, 15, 16,

2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:42.240
 who don't need to go to college.

2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:44.360
 They're already like so smart, they can figure it out.

2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:46.320
 But they wouldn't be allowed to have a bank account, right?

2:17:46.320 --> 2:17:48.440
 So, hey, I think that's kind of cool.

2:17:48.440 --> 2:17:50.000
 Like now you have a permissionless money.

2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:51.400
 You can open up yourself

2:17:51.400 --> 2:17:53.920
 without permission from your parents, that's kind of cool.

2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:55.160
 Yeah, that's fascinating to me.

2:17:55.160 --> 2:18:00.160
 I feel like I would have loved my parents more.

2:18:01.480 --> 2:18:03.000
 Have you had a little more separation?

2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:06.160
 If I had freedom to fully realize myself

2:18:06.160 --> 2:18:08.400
 because I felt like I was a little bit trapped,

2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:11.520
 but I don't know, it's not explicit, right?

2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:15.440
 It's a little bit, it's like a subtle push

2:18:15.440 --> 2:18:17.440
 that you're somehow dependent on them.

2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:19.000
 I mean, part of that is like,

2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:22.120
 I think it actually very much has to do

2:18:22.120 --> 2:18:24.320
 not talking about money, like what does it take

2:18:24.320 --> 2:18:26.560
 to operate as an individual entity in this world?

2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:28.840
 Like knowing that when you're 10 years old,

2:18:28.840 --> 2:18:30.960
 knowing that when you're very young,

2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:35.960
 so that you've, then you see how amazing it is

2:18:35.960 --> 2:18:40.080
 to have the support of your parents until you're 18.

2:18:40.080 --> 2:18:41.520
 Like have that freedom,

2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:46.520
 have the freedom to appreciate the value your parents bring

2:18:47.360 --> 2:18:51.640
 and at the same time, the freedom to leave

2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:56.120
 in some capacity to carve your own path.

2:18:56.120 --> 2:18:59.720
 I mean, just all of that, I think for weirdos like me,

2:18:59.720 --> 2:19:03.000
 especially, because I was a very non traditional path

2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:06.160
 that I think it would be very empowering

2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:08.000
 and certainly it would be empowering in the third world.

2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:10.240
 Not just weirdos like you, yeah, I was gonna mention

2:19:10.240 --> 2:19:13.440
 one of the people I got who taught me about Bitcoin.

2:19:13.440 --> 2:19:14.600
 Her name is Roya Mahbub.

2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:17.240
 She's an Afghan technology CEO.

2:19:17.240 --> 2:19:20.760
 And in 2013, she started paying her employees in Bitcoin

2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:23.800
 because they were not allowed to open bank accounts.

2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:24.760
 The women that worked for her,

2:19:24.760 --> 2:19:27.120
 she started the country's first female,

2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:29.240
 like all female software company.

2:19:29.240 --> 2:19:31.440
 And if they brought cash home,

2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:33.000
 they're like husbands or uncles or brothers

2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:33.840
 would steal it from them.

2:19:33.840 --> 2:19:36.880
 There's like a power patriarchal dominance thing going on.

2:19:36.880 --> 2:19:40.200
 But they had phones and she was able to pay them in Bitcoin

2:19:40.200 --> 2:19:42.640
 and no one knew and it gave them that power.

2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:44.280
 And that's always stuck in my mind

2:19:44.280 --> 2:19:47.280
 as a very interesting effect of this kind of thing,

2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:48.280
 of permissionless money,

2:19:48.280 --> 2:19:50.320
 like that it can be an empowerment tool.

2:19:50.320 --> 2:19:52.040
 So absolutely.

2:19:52.040 --> 2:19:53.800
 So in your own personal life,

2:19:53.800 --> 2:19:58.800
 where did the deep concern for the suffering

2:20:00.240 --> 2:20:02.160
 in the world come from?

2:20:02.160 --> 2:20:03.700
 Where was that born?

2:20:04.760 --> 2:20:07.000
 I was gonna be an engineer actually.

2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:09.400
 And then in 2003, we invaded Iraq

2:20:09.400 --> 2:20:12.600
 and I got very interested in why we did that as a nation.

2:20:12.600 --> 2:20:15.200
 And I switched to my focus of study

2:20:15.200 --> 2:20:16.960
 to like international relations

2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:19.040
 and that's how I kind of went down

2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:22.080
 the kind of political science democracy rabbit hole

2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:24.800
 and ended up getting a job at the Human Rights Foundation.

2:20:24.800 --> 2:20:27.520
 So that I'm a very much a child of like 9 11

2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:28.480
 and the Iraq war.

2:20:28.480 --> 2:20:32.400
 Those are the two really formative events for me personally.

2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:33.680
 Can you break that apart a little bit?

2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:38.680
 Like what illusion about this world was broken apart

2:20:40.800 --> 2:20:43.120
 by the invasion of Iraq?

2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:45.080
 Well, I think first of all,

2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:48.120
 9 11 just shifted the world dynamics completely

2:20:48.120 --> 2:20:50.840
 from a focus on big power politics

2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:52.240
 between the US, Russia and China

2:20:52.240 --> 2:20:55.000
 to this new threat of Islamic terror.

2:20:56.200 --> 2:20:58.320
 And a lot of it we learned later,

2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:00.080
 a lot of the things we did were manufactured,

2:21:00.080 --> 2:21:03.320
 choreographed like there were no WMDs in Iraq.

2:21:03.320 --> 2:21:05.640
 Like the reason our rulers said we needed to invade

2:21:05.640 --> 2:21:07.720
 and destroy this country was a lie.

2:21:07.720 --> 2:21:10.760
 And that I think has really been forgotten.

2:21:10.760 --> 2:21:13.400
 Like I think a lot of like the Zoomers like today

2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:15.640
 don't really know a lot about that time period.

2:21:15.640 --> 2:21:16.880
 I mean, it was pretty crazy.

2:21:16.880 --> 2:21:20.160
 Unanimously, I mean, Democrat, Republican,

2:21:20.160 --> 2:21:23.840
 like Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, like and the Republicans,

2:21:23.840 --> 2:21:25.640
 everybody wanted to invade this country.

2:21:25.640 --> 2:21:26.960
 And it was very, it's very,

2:21:28.880 --> 2:21:30.000
 it's a confusing time.

2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:32.600
 There's a really good book by Ian McEwen called Saturday,

2:21:32.600 --> 2:21:35.760
 a fiction book that takes place during I think 2003.

2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:39.120
 And it's one day in the life of the doctor in London.

2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:41.200
 It's really good though to revisit this time

2:21:41.200 --> 2:21:44.760
 because he has two characters in the book,

2:21:44.760 --> 2:21:46.040
 one of whom is very pro war

2:21:46.040 --> 2:21:47.640
 and one of them is very against war.

2:21:47.640 --> 2:21:49.920
 Basically he, the father himself is pro war

2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:52.040
 and his son is against it and they have all these debates.

2:21:52.040 --> 2:21:54.160
 And it's nice to go back to revisit at that time

2:21:54.160 --> 2:21:55.880
 was it's really crazy.

2:21:55.880 --> 2:21:58.480
 And it really showed you that like the media

2:21:58.480 --> 2:22:01.720
 could be captured into like helping promote this idea

2:22:01.720 --> 2:22:03.720
 of like invading another country.

2:22:03.720 --> 2:22:05.920
 So I was very curious about why we did it

2:22:05.920 --> 2:22:07.720
 and like who was pulling the strings

2:22:07.720 --> 2:22:09.920
 and what are the reasons that we went.

2:22:09.920 --> 2:22:12.200
 And what's really interesting is that like,

2:22:12.200 --> 2:22:13.400
 I took all these courses on it

2:22:13.400 --> 2:22:15.760
 and interviewed all these decision makers,

2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:17.600
 whether they were like neocons or whatever,

2:22:17.600 --> 2:22:19.320
 different people who were involved.

2:22:19.320 --> 2:22:22.520
 And the whole like dollar reserve currency thing,

2:22:22.520 --> 2:22:24.400
 like really never came up until like,

2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:26.680
 I learned about it more recently because of Bitcoin.

2:22:26.680 --> 2:22:28.520
 Like, and today when I look back,

2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:29.520
 it seems kind of obvious

2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:31.040
 that the reason we invaded Iraq

2:22:31.040 --> 2:22:35.080
 was because Saddam Hussein wanted to sell oil and euros.

2:22:35.080 --> 2:22:36.160
 This seems really obvious

2:22:36.160 --> 2:22:38.480
 when you go back and look at the chronology of it.

2:22:38.480 --> 2:22:39.480
 And we were like, no,

2:22:39.480 --> 2:22:41.800
 we actually don't want you to sell dollars and euros

2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:43.480
 because that would threaten the dollar.

2:22:43.480 --> 2:22:45.360
 So we're gonna invade you and then you're not gonna do it

2:22:45.360 --> 2:22:47.400
 and then no one else is gonna like sell the dollars and euros

2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:49.000
 you just oil and euros, right?

2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:51.720
 I guess you could say the same thing about Gaddafi,

2:22:51.720 --> 2:22:55.680
 but we as a nation have very much protected

2:22:55.680 --> 2:22:57.720
 our reserve currency, let's put it that way.

2:22:57.720 --> 2:22:58.880
 Yeah, that's actually one of the things

2:22:58.880 --> 2:23:01.080
 that Bitcoin community has motivated me to do

2:23:01.080 --> 2:23:04.680
 is to look back to the histories that I have studied myself

2:23:04.680 --> 2:23:07.240
 from just even the two world wars,

2:23:07.240 --> 2:23:08.880
 the history of the 20th century

2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:13.120
 from a perspective of the monetary system of money.

2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:14.600
 And it's interesting.

2:23:14.600 --> 2:23:16.320
 It's interesting to look at human history

2:23:16.320 --> 2:23:17.480
 in the context of money.

2:23:17.480 --> 2:23:19.920
 Can't we be patriotic and be pro America,

2:23:19.920 --> 2:23:21.840
 but like not want the petro dollar?

2:23:21.840 --> 2:23:24.000
 Like I should be proud of my country.

2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:26.120
 Why do we need to be propping up the Saudis?

2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:29.560
 Why do we need to be threatening to invade other countries

2:23:29.560 --> 2:23:31.640
 if they sell their oil for a different currency?

2:23:31.640 --> 2:23:33.800
 I think we can be just as powerful as we are today

2:23:33.800 --> 2:23:36.040
 if not more powerful in a Bitcoin world.

2:23:36.040 --> 2:23:37.520
 If you think about the infrastructure,

2:23:37.520 --> 2:23:38.920
 Americans are building all the innovations

2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:40.560
 we're building, all the wealth we have,

2:23:40.560 --> 2:23:42.840
 I think we'll be fine, better than fine.

2:23:42.840 --> 2:23:45.760
 And we won't have these horrible negative externalities.

2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:49.800
 It's really an optimistic vision for the future.

2:23:49.800 --> 2:23:51.880
 I thought we learned the lesson of 9 11

2:23:51.880 --> 2:23:56.600
 and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, but maybe...

2:23:56.600 --> 2:23:57.720
 We're believing in, you know,

2:23:57.720 --> 2:24:01.040
 Biden announced we're leaving Afghanistan this year, 20 years.

2:24:01.040 --> 2:24:02.360
 For what?

2:24:02.360 --> 2:24:03.720
 The Taliban are going to take over again.

2:24:03.720 --> 2:24:05.640
 I mean, that's like at least a good,

2:24:05.640 --> 2:24:08.320
 this is the longest war, right?

2:24:08.320 --> 2:24:09.640
 The forever wars.

2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:11.960
 I feel like the past 20 years or whatever,

2:24:11.960 --> 2:24:15.560
 it is 18 years, 19 years.

2:24:16.600 --> 2:24:19.880
 We've been very skeptical about invading other countries

2:24:19.880 --> 2:24:23.800
 about, we've been skeptical

2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:26.800
 about military intervention in other nations.

2:24:28.400 --> 2:24:30.320
 Well, our leaders certainly haven't.

2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:32.800
 We're like seven active wars right now.

2:24:32.800 --> 2:24:35.000
 And neither the Russians and the Chinese,

2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.920
 everybody's starting to invade everybody else.

2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:40.120
 I mean, so yes, but I meant to a degree

2:24:40.120 --> 2:24:42.200
 that I was worried about like conflicts

2:24:42.200 --> 2:24:46.440
 with the hot conflicts with Iran, with North Korea,

2:24:46.440 --> 2:24:47.440
 those kinds of things.

2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:48.280
 Sure.

2:24:48.280 --> 2:24:53.280
 There was not as much war mongering as I was afraid about,

2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:55.840
 but yes, you're absolutely right.

2:24:55.840 --> 2:24:59.360
 We're still, there's a big presence by the United States

2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:01.920
 and other nations and across the world,

2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:05.000
 that's military, the military industrial complex

2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:10.000
 is a thing that has huge detrimental ripple effects

2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:14.120
 throughout the entirety of our governments.

2:25:14.120 --> 2:25:15.080
 Yeah, so the big question is,

2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:18.920
 how do we prevent the rise of this like authoritarian

2:25:20.240 --> 2:25:23.800
 surveillance state in China, while at the same time,

2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:26.040
 kind of diffusing the military industrial complex

2:25:26.040 --> 2:25:26.960
 on our side?

2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:29.720
 That to me is like the biggest challenge of our time.

2:25:29.720 --> 2:25:32.360
 I don't have the answer, but we should keep digging.

2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:36.560
 Yeah, I believe there's a technological innovations.

2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:38.160
 You're suggesting that perhaps one

2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:40.880
 of the technological innovations like is Bitcoin.

2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:42.160
 Bitcoin's a big part of it, yeah.

2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:44.480
 On the money side, I think the information side,

2:25:44.480 --> 2:25:48.240
 there's innovations that are open, that's possible.

2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:51.440
 And the political side, I'm the most skeptical about.

2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:54.360
 I just feel like there's without hot wars

2:25:54.360 --> 2:25:57.280
 that we don't seem to make any kind of progress.

2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:01.080
 Bureaucracy's just grow, corruption and greed grow

2:26:01.080 --> 2:26:05.680
 and human nature does not do well in the political arena.

2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:09.400
 So I hope technology can outpace

2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:11.080
 the darker sides of human nature.

2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:14.840
 So you're busy fighting the demons,

2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:16.200
 the darkness that's out there,

2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:19.080
 but looking in the mirror, you're a finite being.

2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:22.160
 Unfortunately, this ride ends for you pretty soon.

2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:28.440
 Do you ever ask yourself about the meaning middle

2:26:28.440 --> 2:26:32.480
 of why the hell is descendants of apes

2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:34.120
 are even on this thing,

2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:36.840
 striving so hard to make a better world for ourselves?

2:26:36.840 --> 2:26:39.240
 I don't often zoom out that much.

2:26:39.240 --> 2:26:41.840
 I feel like my day job is pretty interesting.

2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:45.120
 It keeps me very engaged with all the stuff

2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:47.120
 we've been talking about.

2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:51.240
 As far as the meaning of life though,

2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:56.240
 it seems quite clear that we do have the possibility

2:26:56.440 --> 2:27:01.440
 as a species to create the beautiful communities

2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:04.040
 and constructs and to share an exploration

2:27:04.040 --> 2:27:09.040
 of the world together that is often marred by cold realities

2:27:10.440 --> 2:27:11.640
 that we've discussed,

2:27:11.640 --> 2:27:16.640
 but I do feel like in a way that the meaning of life

2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:20.440
 is that pursuit, of course, biologically

2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:22.840
 is the spread of our species, right?

2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:27.840
 But also to pursue knowledge and science and innovation

2:27:28.040 --> 2:27:30.640
 and freedom most importantly.

2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:34.040
 I think freedom has to guide us or else we end up

2:27:34.040 --> 2:27:35.240
 with prison camps.

2:27:35.240 --> 2:27:36.640
 If we don't let freedom guide us,

2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:38.040
 we end up with the prison camps.

2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:40.040
 So we need to have scientific innovation

2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:43.240
 and adventurism and colonization of the stars,

2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:45.840
 but without the slavery and without the prison camps.

2:27:45.840 --> 2:27:47.240
 I think that's so key.

2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:50.640
 There's something about the creation of beauty

2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:52.440
 that seems fundamental to human nature

2:27:52.440 --> 2:27:57.440
 and what seems beautiful is these communities

2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:01.440
 that don't have suffering, they don't have injustice.

2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:05.440
 And we have some kind of inner sense of what is injustice.

2:28:05.440 --> 2:28:07.240
 I don't know, like some of the human rights

2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:08.440
 that you've mentioned earlier,

2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:12.440
 they're just philosophical constructs,

2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:16.440
 but there also seem to be somehow deeply in us too.

2:28:16.440 --> 2:28:20.440
 We have a sense of what is right and what is wrong.

2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:23.440
 It's not just a kind of illusion

2:28:23.440 --> 2:28:27.440
 that we've all agreed on.

2:28:27.440 --> 2:28:31.440
 Yeah, like arbitrary power, torture, executions.

2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:32.440
 We know these things are wrong.

2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:34.440
 I mean, we know they're wrong.

2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:36.440
 We don't have to read a book to know that.

2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:41.440
 But you do need to, people can get brainwashed.

2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:43.440
 I mean, you talk to people who've grown up in North Korea

2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:45.440
 that they don't know any better.

2:28:45.440 --> 2:28:48.440
 Like they don't know what's going on in the outside world.

2:28:48.440 --> 2:28:50.440
 So they've never experienced anything differently.

2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:54.440
 So that's why, look, technology can play a big role here

2:28:54.440 --> 2:28:56.440
 in terms of the meaning of it all.

2:28:56.440 --> 2:28:58.440
 It can really help emancipate, liberate people,

2:28:58.440 --> 2:29:01.440
 at least so that they can make their own choices about what to do.

2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:03.440
 At least so that we're on a level playing field.

2:29:03.440 --> 2:29:06.440
 So technologies like the internet and Bitcoin,

2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:09.440
 they can at least give you the option

2:29:09.440 --> 2:29:12.440
 to do things your own way on your own terms.

2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:15.440
 And then from there, we'll see.

2:29:15.440 --> 2:29:18.440
 I think it's important that we have design choices

2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:22.440
 where we can have a little more say

2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:25.440
 and not everything be preprogrammed for us.

2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:27.440
 That would be very disappointing.

2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:31.440
 So, I mean, the open web and encryption in Bitcoin,

2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:35.440
 these are things that help prevent social engineering

2:29:35.440 --> 2:29:39.440
 and that promote more freedom and more possibilities, honestly,

2:29:39.440 --> 2:29:41.440
 and more entrepreneurship and more creativity

2:29:41.440 --> 2:29:43.440
 and more scientific inquiry.

2:29:43.440 --> 2:29:45.440
 I mean, think about the people who tried to shut down

2:29:45.440 --> 2:29:48.440
 scientific inquiry 500, 600 years ago or whatever

2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:50.440
 that were trying to say,

2:29:50.440 --> 2:29:53.440
 the earth was the center of everything

2:29:53.440 --> 2:29:55.440
 and they were wrong.

2:29:55.440 --> 2:29:58.440
 And then all these conservative religious types throughout history

2:29:58.440 --> 2:30:02.440
 have always said that there's no value in science

2:30:02.440 --> 2:30:04.440
 and there's no value in technology

2:30:04.440 --> 2:30:06.440
 and they've been wrong the whole time.

2:30:06.440 --> 2:30:09.440
 So let's continue pushing here. Let's continue pushing.

2:30:09.440 --> 2:30:12.440
 It's kind of scary to me sometimes, humbling, beautiful,

2:30:12.440 --> 2:30:16.440
 but also scary to think of, you mentioned North Korea,

2:30:16.440 --> 2:30:19.440
 people are kind of living in ignorance.

2:30:19.440 --> 2:30:22.440
 It's scary to me to think about how much ignorance there is

2:30:22.440 --> 2:30:25.440
 in the world today, like how little I know personally

2:30:25.440 --> 2:30:29.440
 or us as a human civilization knows there's yet to be discovered.

2:30:29.440 --> 2:30:32.440
 Well, there's a difference between laziness and ignorance, right?

2:30:32.440 --> 2:30:37.440
 So, I would be lazy if I didn't take advantage of the internet, right?

2:30:37.440 --> 2:30:39.440
 Someone in North Korea doesn't have the option.

2:30:39.440 --> 2:30:40.440
 They don't have the option.

2:30:40.440 --> 2:30:42.440
 There's literally no way for them to access the internet.

2:30:42.440 --> 2:30:46.440
 So there's kind of like social laziness

2:30:46.440 --> 2:30:48.440
 that philosophers have warned about forever,

2:30:48.440 --> 2:30:51.440
 that we basically become sheep, okay?

2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:55.440
 And then there's actual like brainwashing and censorship

2:30:55.440 --> 2:30:58.440
 that's possible, like by closing off your population

2:30:58.440 --> 2:31:00.440
 and keeping them off like the internet, right?

2:31:00.440 --> 2:31:03.440
 So I think these are two very different concepts.

2:31:03.440 --> 2:31:05.440
 Absolutely. But I also mean just like,

2:31:05.440 --> 2:31:08.440
 not even laziness, but cognitive limitations

2:31:08.440 --> 2:31:11.440
 and just historical scientific limitations.

2:31:11.440 --> 2:31:16.440
 Like, you know, we're a very young species.

2:31:16.440 --> 2:31:18.440
 Like all of the exciting stuff we've been talking about

2:31:18.440 --> 2:31:21.440
 have happened on the scale of decades, maybe centuries.

2:31:21.440 --> 2:31:22.440
 It's very, we're very young

2:31:22.440 --> 2:31:24.440
 and all the cool stuff we've come up with.

2:31:24.440 --> 2:31:27.440
 And it's just humbling to think about how little we know.

2:31:27.440 --> 2:31:30.440
 But you're right that, you know,

2:31:30.440 --> 2:31:33.440
 ultimately having the freedom to keep exploring,

2:31:33.440 --> 2:31:35.440
 keep venturing out.

2:31:35.440 --> 2:31:38.440
 Even if we later discovered that a lot of the stuff

2:31:38.440 --> 2:31:43.440
 we've been doing now is ethically horrible.

2:31:43.440 --> 2:31:47.440
 If you think about animals or I think about robots a lot,

2:31:47.440 --> 2:31:52.440
 the kind of things we might be doing to other consciousnesses

2:31:52.440 --> 2:31:54.440
 that are here on earth might be,

2:31:54.440 --> 2:31:56.440
 we might see as atrocities later on,

2:31:56.440 --> 2:31:58.440
 but ultimately you have to have the freedom

2:31:58.440 --> 2:32:00.440
 to explore those kinds of ideas.

2:32:00.440 --> 2:32:02.440
 And without that freedom,

2:32:02.440 --> 2:32:05.440
 you don't even get the chance to be lazy.

2:32:05.440 --> 2:32:08.440
 Yeah, I mean, look, don't be a sheep.

2:32:08.440 --> 2:32:09.440
 It's easy to be a sheep.

2:32:09.440 --> 2:32:10.440
 No offense to sheep.

2:32:10.440 --> 2:32:12.440
 And there's some practical things, man.

2:32:12.440 --> 2:32:14.440
 Get on signal, start encrypting your messages.

2:32:14.440 --> 2:32:17.440
 Take control over your privacy.

2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:20.440
 The media doesn't want you to, but check out Bitcoin.

2:32:20.440 --> 2:32:22.440
 You can be your own bank.

2:32:22.440 --> 2:32:23.440
 You can transact with people around the world

2:32:23.440 --> 2:32:25.440
 and no one can stop you.

2:32:25.440 --> 2:32:28.440
 This can put a stop to a lot of arbitrary power

2:32:28.440 --> 2:32:31.440
 and a lot of human rights violations.

2:32:31.440 --> 2:32:33.440
 You know, don't use WeChat.

2:32:33.440 --> 2:32:35.440
 Question more.

2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:38.440
 You know, research what's happening in Xinjiang.

2:32:38.440 --> 2:32:40.440
 I mean, learn about what's happening

2:32:40.440 --> 2:32:42.440
 in the genocide in that country.

2:32:42.440 --> 2:32:44.440
 And let's think about how we can build our societies

2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:46.440
 so that we never have that kind of power

2:32:46.440 --> 2:32:48.440
 concentration ever again.

2:32:48.440 --> 2:32:50.440
 Each of us can make a difference.

2:32:50.440 --> 2:32:52.440
 Alex, it's a huge honor to talk to you.

2:32:52.440 --> 2:32:53.440
 I've been a fan of your work.

2:32:53.440 --> 2:32:55.440
 A lot of people spoke really highly of you

2:32:55.440 --> 2:32:58.440
 as one of the beacons of hope for our human souls.

2:32:58.440 --> 2:33:01.440
 So I'm really glad we got a chance to talk.

2:33:01.440 --> 2:33:03.440
 Thank you for wasting all this time with me today.

2:33:03.440 --> 2:33:05.440
 It's been an honor. Thanks, man. A lot of fun.

2:33:05.440 --> 2:33:07.440
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:33:07.440 --> 2:33:09.440
 with Alex Glastin.

 And now let me leave you with some words from Alice Walker.

2:33:18.440 --> 2:33:21.440
 The most common way people give up their power

2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:24.440
 is by thinking they don't have any.

2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:28.440
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
