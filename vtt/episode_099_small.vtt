00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
 The following is a conversation with Carl Friston, one of the greatest neuroscientists in history,

00:06.960 --> 00:13.520
 cited over 245,000 times, known for many influential ideas in brain imaging,

00:13.520 --> 00:18.160
 neuroscience, and theoretical neurobiology, including especially

00:18.160 --> 00:22.960
 the fascinating idea of the free energy principle for action and perception.

00:22.960 --> 00:31.680
 Carl's mix of humor, brilliance, and kindness to me are inspiring and captivating. This was a

00:31.680 --> 00:38.000
 huge honor and a pleasure. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe

 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. When you get it,

01:03.920 --> 01:09.920
 use code LEX Podcast. Cash App lets you send money to friends by Bitcoin and invest in the

01:09.920 --> 01:16.080
 stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App allows you to send and receive money digitally,

01:16.080 --> 01:21.920
 let me mention a surprising fact related to physical money. Of all the currency in the world,

01:21.920 --> 01:29.200
 roughly 8% of it is actual physical money. The other 92% of money only exists digitally.

01:29.840 --> 01:35.600
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play, and use the code LEX Podcast,

01:35.600 --> 01:41.360
 you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 the first, an organization that is helping to

01:41.360 --> 01:46.960
 advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now, here's my

01:46.960 --> 01:53.520
 conversation with Carl Friston. How much of the human brain do we understand from

01:54.320 --> 02:01.520
 the low level of neuronal communication to the functional level to the highest level,

02:01.520 --> 02:07.200
 maybe the psychiatric disorder level? Well, we're certainly in a better position than we were last

02:07.200 --> 02:14.240
 century. How far we've got to go, I think, is almost an answerable question. So you'd have to

02:14.240 --> 02:21.680
 set the parameters, what constitutes understanding, what level of understanding do you want.

02:21.680 --> 02:30.880
 I think we've made enormous progress in terms of broad brush principles, whether that affords a

02:30.880 --> 02:35.840
 detailed cartography of the functional anatomy of the brain and what it does, and write down to

02:35.840 --> 02:41.280
 the microcircuitry and the neurons, that's probably out of reach at the present time.

02:42.080 --> 02:47.280
 So the cartography, so mapping the brain. Do you think mapping of the brain,

02:47.280 --> 02:54.480
 the detailed, perfect imaging of it, does that get us closer to understanding of the mind

02:55.120 --> 03:00.640
 of the brain? So how far does it get us if we have that perfect cartography of the brain?

03:00.640 --> 03:07.360
 I think there are lower bounds on that. It's a really interesting question. It would determine

03:07.360 --> 03:13.440
 this sort of scientific career you'd pursue if you believe that knowing every dendritic connection,

03:14.000 --> 03:20.080
 every sort of microscopic synaptic structure, right down to the molecular level, was going to

03:20.080 --> 03:25.600
 give you the right kind of information to understand the computational anatomy. Then you'd

03:25.600 --> 03:32.640
 choose to be a microscopist and you would study little cubic millimeters of brain for the rest

03:32.640 --> 03:40.080
 of your life. If on the other hand you were interested in holistic functions and a sort

03:40.080 --> 03:44.640
 of functional anatomy of the sort that a neuropsychologist would understand, you'd study

03:44.640 --> 03:50.480
 brain lesions and strokes, just looking at the whole person. So again, it comes back to at what

03:50.480 --> 03:58.880
 level do you want understanding. I think there are principled reasons not to go too far. If you

03:58.880 --> 04:08.160
 commit to a view of the brain as a machine that's performing a form of inference and representing

04:08.160 --> 04:21.440
 things, that level of understanding is necessarily cast in terms of probability densities and ensemble

04:21.440 --> 04:28.240
 densities, distributions. What that tells you is that you don't really want to look at the atoms

04:28.240 --> 04:33.520
 to understand the thermodynamics of probabilistic descriptions for how the brain works.

04:33.520 --> 04:41.840
 So I personally wouldn't look at the molecules or indeed the single neurons in the same way if I

04:41.840 --> 04:47.680
 wanted to understand the thermodynamics of some nonequilibrium steady state of a gas or an active

04:47.680 --> 04:55.280
 material. I wouldn't spend my life looking at the individual molecules that constitute that ensemble.

04:55.280 --> 05:00.480
 I'd look at that collective behavior. On the other hand, if you go to coarse grain, you're going to

05:00.480 --> 05:07.200
 miss some basic canonical principles of connectivity and architectures. I'm thinking here

05:08.640 --> 05:15.120
 this bit colloquial, but there's current excitement about high field magnetic resonance imaging at

05:15.120 --> 05:20.960
 7 Tesla. Why? Well, it gives us for the first time the opportunity to look at the brain in action

05:21.680 --> 05:27.520
 at the level of a few millimeters that distinguish between different layers of the cortex that may

05:27.520 --> 05:35.280
 be very important in terms of evincing generic principles of canonical microcircuitry that

05:35.280 --> 05:40.560
 are replicated throughout the brain that may tell us something fundamental about message passing in

05:40.560 --> 05:47.520
 the brain and these density dynamics or neuronal ensemble population dynamics that underwrite

05:47.520 --> 05:52.720
 our brain function. So somewhere between a millimeter and a meter.

05:52.720 --> 06:00.000
 Yeah. Lingering for a bit on the big questions, if you allow me. What to use the most beautiful

06:00.000 --> 06:06.640
 or surprising characteristic of the human brain? I think it's hierarchical and recursive aspect,

06:06.640 --> 06:12.880
 it's recurrent aspect. Of the structure or of the actual representation or power of the brain?

06:12.880 --> 06:18.640
 Well, I think one speaks to the other. I was actually answering in a delminded way from the

06:18.640 --> 06:24.080
 point of view of purely its anatomy and its structural aspects. I mean, there are many

06:24.080 --> 06:30.960
 marvelous organs in the body. Let's take your liver, for example. Without it, you wouldn't

06:30.960 --> 06:37.360
 be around for very long and it does some beautiful and delicate biochemistry and homeostasis and

06:38.880 --> 06:45.040
 evolved with a finesse that would easily parallel the brain, but it doesn't have a beautiful anatomy.

06:45.040 --> 06:49.120
 It has a simple anatomy, which is attractive in a minimalist sense, but it doesn't have that

06:49.120 --> 06:55.280
 crafted structure of sparse connectivity and that recurrence and that specialization

06:55.280 --> 06:59.360
 that the brain has. So you said a lot of interesting terms here. So the recurrence,

06:59.360 --> 07:07.120
 the sparsity, but you also started by saying hierarchical. So I've never thought of our

07:07.120 --> 07:15.920
 brain as hierarchical. I always thought it's just like a giant, interconnected mess where

07:15.920 --> 07:21.680
 it's very difficult to figure anything out. But in what sense do you see the brain as hierarchical?

07:21.680 --> 07:29.280
 Well, I see it. It's not a magic soup. Of course, it's what I used to think when I was

07:29.280 --> 07:37.600
 before I studied medicine and the like. So a lot of those terms imply each other.

07:38.640 --> 07:44.880
 So hierarchies, if you just think about the nature of a hierarchy, how would you actually

07:44.880 --> 07:51.040
 build one? And what you would have to do is basically carefully remove the right connections

07:51.040 --> 07:58.160
 that destroy the completely connected soups that you might have in mind. So a hierarchy is

07:58.160 --> 08:02.880
 in and of itself defined by a sparse and particular connectivity structure.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.120
 And I'm not committing to any particular form of hierarchy.

08:08.320 --> 08:13.360
 But your sense says there is some. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. In virtue of the fact that there is a

08:13.360 --> 08:20.080
 sparsity of connectivity, not necessarily of a qualitative sort, but certainly of a quantitative

08:20.080 --> 08:30.000
 sort. So it is demonstrably so that the further apart two parts of the brain are, the less likely

08:30.000 --> 08:36.480
 that they are to be wired to possess axonal processes, neuronal processes that directly

08:37.360 --> 08:42.000
 communicate one message or messages from one part of that brain to the other part of the brain.

08:42.560 --> 08:49.520
 So we know there's a sparse connectivity. And furthermore, on the basis of anatomical

08:49.520 --> 09:00.000
 connectivity and tracer studies, we know that that has that sparsity underwrites a hierarchical

09:00.000 --> 09:07.680
 and very structured sort of connectivity that might be best understood like a little bit like

09:07.680 --> 09:16.080
 an onion. There is a concentric, sometimes referred to as centripetal by people like

09:16.080 --> 09:22.640
 Marcel Mesulam, hierarchical organisation to the brain. So you can think of the brain as in a rough

09:22.640 --> 09:31.920
 sense like an onion and all the sensory information and all the afferent outgoing messages that supply

09:31.920 --> 09:38.320
 commands to your muscles or to your secretory organs come from the surface. So there's a massive

09:38.320 --> 09:44.640
 exchange interface with the world out there on the surface. And then underneath, there's a little

09:44.640 --> 09:51.360
 layer that sits and looks at the exchange on the surface. And then underneath that, there's a layer

09:51.360 --> 09:57.120
 right the way down to the very centre through the deepest part of the onion. That's what I mean by

09:57.120 --> 10:04.720
 a hierarchical organisation. There's a discernible structure defined by the sparsity of connections

10:04.720 --> 10:11.040
 that lends the architecture, a hierarchical structure that tells one a lot about the kinds

10:11.040 --> 10:16.240
 of representations and messages. So going back to your earlier question, is this about the

10:16.240 --> 10:23.120
 representational capacity? Or is it about the anatomy? Well, one underwrites the other.

10:24.480 --> 10:31.200
 If one simply thinks of the brain as a message passing machine, a process that is in the service

10:31.200 --> 10:39.920
 of doing something, then the circuitry and the connectivity that shape that message passing

10:39.920 --> 10:46.160
 also dictate its function. So you've done a lot of amazing work in a lot of directions.

10:46.800 --> 10:52.720
 So let's look at one aspect of that, of looking into the brain and trying to study this onion

10:52.720 --> 10:59.680
 structure. What can we learn about the brain by imaging it? Which is one way to sort of look

10:59.680 --> 11:06.240
 at the anatomy of it, broadly speaking. What are the methods of imaging, but even bigger? What can

11:06.240 --> 11:17.600
 we learn about it? Right. So well, most human neuroimaging that you might see in science journals

11:19.200 --> 11:25.680
 that speaks to the way the brain works, measures brain activity over time. So that's the first

11:25.680 --> 11:32.240
 thing to say that we're effectively looking at fluctuations in neuronal responses,

11:32.240 --> 11:40.960
 usually in response to some sensory input or some instruction, some task. Not necessarily,

11:40.960 --> 11:46.560
 there's a lot of interest in just looking at the brain in terms of resting state and dodgeness or

11:46.560 --> 11:53.360
 intrinsic activity. But crucially, at every point, looking at these fluctuations either induced or

11:53.360 --> 12:02.480
 intrinsic in the neural activity and understanding them at two levels. So normally, people would

12:02.480 --> 12:08.880
 recourse to two principles of brain organization that are complementary. One, functional specialization

12:08.880 --> 12:15.120
 or segregation. So what does that mean? It simply means that there are certain parts of the brain

12:15.680 --> 12:21.680
 that may be specialized for certain kinds of processing, for example, visual motion. Our

12:21.680 --> 12:29.440
 ability to recognize or to perceive movement in the visual world. And furthermore, that

12:29.440 --> 12:35.280
 specialized processing may be spatially or anatomically segregated, leading to functional

12:35.280 --> 12:41.520
 segregation, which means that if I were to compare your brain activity during a period of

12:42.720 --> 12:49.840
 viewing a static image, and then compare that to the responses of fluctuations in the brain

12:49.840 --> 12:58.720
 when you were exposed to a moving image, so a flying bird, we would expect to see restricted,

12:58.720 --> 13:04.720
 segregated differences in activity. And those are basically the hotspots that you see in the

13:04.720 --> 13:10.880
 in statistical parametric maps that test for the significance of the responses that are circumscribed.

13:10.880 --> 13:18.720
 So now, basically, we're talking about some people of perhaps unkindly called a neo cartography.

13:18.720 --> 13:25.520
 This is a phrenology augmented by modern day neuroimaging, basically finding

13:26.800 --> 13:33.200
 blobs or bumps on the brain that do this or do that. I'm trying to understand the cartography

13:33.200 --> 13:42.000
 of that functional specialization. So how much is there such a beautiful sort of ideal to strive

13:42.000 --> 13:49.120
 for? We humans scientists would like this to hope that there's a beautiful structure to this,

13:49.120 --> 13:52.880
 whereas, like you said, there are segregated regions that are responsible for the different

13:52.880 --> 13:58.720
 function. How much hope is there to find such regions in terms of looking at the progress

13:59.440 --> 14:04.720
 of studying the brain? Oh, I think enormous progress has been made in the past 20 or 30 years.

14:04.720 --> 14:14.240
 So this is beyond incremental. At the advent of brain imaging, the very notion of functional

14:14.240 --> 14:21.600
 segregation was just a hypothesis based upon a century, if not more, of careful neuropsychology,

14:21.600 --> 14:28.720
 looking at people who had lost via insult or traumatic brain injury, particular parts of

14:28.720 --> 14:32.800
 the brain, and then saying, well, they can't do this or they can't do that. For example,

14:32.800 --> 14:38.080
 losing the visual cortex and not being able to see or usually losing particular parts of the

14:38.640 --> 14:45.760
 visual cortex or regions known as V5 or the middle temporal region,

14:46.880 --> 14:52.960
 MT, and noticing that they selectively could not see moving things. And so that created the

14:54.480 --> 15:00.880
 hypothesis that perhaps movement processing, visual movement processing, was located in

15:00.880 --> 15:06.720
 this functionally segregated area. And you could then go and put invasive electrodes in animal

15:06.720 --> 15:13.280
 models and say, yes, indeed, we can excite activity here, we can form receptive fields that

15:13.280 --> 15:18.000
 are sensitive to or defined in terms of visual motion. But at no point could you exclude the

15:18.000 --> 15:22.960
 possibility that everywhere else in the brain was also very interested in visual motion.

15:22.960 --> 15:28.000
 By the way, I apologize to Interoppa's a tiny little tangent. He said animal models

15:28.000 --> 15:34.800
 are just out of curiosity from your perspective. How different is the human brain versus the

15:34.800 --> 15:38.800
 other animals in terms of our ability to study the brain?

15:38.800 --> 15:45.600
 Well, clearly, the further away you go from a human brain, the greater the differences,

15:45.600 --> 15:51.600
 but not as remarkable as you might think. So people will choose their level of

15:52.240 --> 15:57.200
 approximation to the human brain, depending upon the kinds of questions that they want to answer.

15:57.200 --> 16:02.720
 So if you're talking about canonical principles of microcircuitry, it might be perfectly okay

16:02.720 --> 16:08.800
 to look at a mouse, indeed, you could even look at flies, worms. If on the other hand,

16:08.800 --> 16:14.960
 you wanted to look at the finer details of organization of visual cortex and V1, V2,

16:14.960 --> 16:19.520
 these are designated patches of cortex that may do different things, indeed do.

16:20.480 --> 16:25.600
 You probably want to use a primate that looked a little bit more like a human,

16:25.600 --> 16:32.880
 because there are lots of ethical issues in terms of the use of nonhuman primates to

16:34.000 --> 16:40.960
 transfer questions about human anatomy. But I think most people assume that most of the

16:40.960 --> 16:52.400
 important principles are conserved in a continuous way, right from worms right through to you and me.

16:52.400 --> 16:59.840
 So now returning to this, so that was the early, the ideas of studying the functional

16:59.840 --> 17:04.480
 regions of the brain by, if there's some damage to it to try to infer that there's

17:05.120 --> 17:08.960
 that part of the brain might be somewhat responsible for this type of function.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.880
 So what, where does that lead us? What are the next steps beyond that?

17:12.880 --> 17:18.240
 Right, well, this actually is a reverse a bit, come back to your sort of notion that the brain

17:18.240 --> 17:24.560
 is a magic zoo, but that was actually a very prominent idea at one point to notions such as

17:25.200 --> 17:33.920
 Lashley's law of mass action inherited from the observation that for certain animals,

17:33.920 --> 17:38.480
 if you just took out spoonfuls of the brain, it didn't matter where you took these spoonfuls

17:38.480 --> 17:43.760
 out, they always show the same kinds of deficits. So, you know, it was very difficult to infer

17:43.760 --> 17:50.560
 functional specialization pure on the basis of lesion deficit studies. But once we had the

17:50.560 --> 17:55.120
 opportunity to look at the brain lighting up in its, it's literally it's sort of excitement,

17:55.120 --> 18:03.840
 neuronal excitement. When looking at this versus that, one was able to say, yes, indeed, these

18:03.840 --> 18:09.040
 functionally specialized responses are very restricted and they're here or they're over there.

18:09.040 --> 18:16.320
 If I do this, then this part of the brain lights up. And that became doable in the early 90s.

18:17.200 --> 18:21.360
 In fact, you know, shortly before with the advent of positron emission tomography,

18:21.360 --> 18:27.920
 and then functional magnetic resonance imaging came along in the early 90s. And since that time,

18:27.920 --> 18:36.400
 there has been an explosion of discovery, refinement, confirmation. You know, there are

18:36.400 --> 18:40.800
 people who believe that it's all in the anatomy. If you understand the anatomy, then you understand

18:40.800 --> 18:47.600
 the function at some level. And many, many hypotheses were predicated on a deep understanding

18:47.600 --> 18:52.240
 of the anatomy and the connectivity. But they were all confirmed and taken much further

18:53.680 --> 18:57.920
 with neuroimaging. So that's what I meant by we've made an enormous amount of progress

18:57.920 --> 19:06.880
 in this century, indeed, and in relation to the previous century by looking at these

19:06.880 --> 19:12.560
 functionally selective responses. But that wasn't the whole story. So there's this sort of near

19:12.560 --> 19:17.920
 phrenology, but finding bumps and hops spots in the brain that did this or that. The bigger

19:17.920 --> 19:26.800
 question was, of course, the functional integration, how all of these regionally specific responses

19:26.800 --> 19:32.720
 were orchestrated, how they were distributed, how did they relate to distributed processing and,

19:32.720 --> 19:40.240
 indeed, representations in the brain. So then you turn to the more challenging issue of the

19:40.240 --> 19:46.080
 integration of the connectivity. And then we come back to this beautiful sparse, recurrent,

19:46.080 --> 19:53.200
 hierarchical connectivity that seems characteristic of the brain and probably not many other organs.

19:53.200 --> 19:59.840
 And, but nevertheless, we come back to this challenge of trying to figure out how everything

19:59.840 --> 20:05.200
 is integrated. But what's your feeling? What's the general consensus? Have we moved away from

20:05.200 --> 20:12.480
 the magic soup view of the brain? So there is a deep structure to it. And then maybe

20:13.520 --> 20:17.920
 a further question, you said some people believe that the structure is most of it,

20:17.920 --> 20:22.400
 that you could really get at the core of the function by just deeply understanding the structure.

20:22.400 --> 20:28.080
 Where do you sit on that? Do you? I think it's got some mileage to it. Yes. Yeah.

20:28.080 --> 20:34.640
 So it's a worthy pursuit of going, of studying through imaging and all the different methods

20:34.640 --> 20:40.880
 to actually study the structure. No, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, I'm just noting you were accusing

20:40.880 --> 20:44.560
 me of using lots of long words. And then you introduced one there, which is deep, which is

20:44.560 --> 20:52.560
 interesting. Because deep is the sort of millennial equivalent of hierarchical. So if you put deep

20:52.560 --> 20:58.720
 in front of anything, not only are you very millennial and very trending, but you're also

20:58.720 --> 21:05.120
 implying a hierarchical architecture. So it is a depth, which is for me the beautiful thing.

21:05.120 --> 21:10.960
 That's right. The word deep kind of, yeah, exactly. It implies hierarchy. I didn't even think about

21:10.960 --> 21:18.640
 that. That indeed the implicit meaning of the word deep is a hierarchy. Yeah. Yeah. So deep

21:18.640 --> 21:25.600
 inside the onion is the center of your soul. Let's see. Beautifully put. Maybe briefly, if you

21:25.600 --> 21:32.320
 can paint a picture of the kind of methods of neuroimaging, maybe the history, which you were

21:32.320 --> 21:37.760
 a part of from statistical parametric mapping. I mean, just what's out there that's interesting

21:37.760 --> 21:43.760
 for people maybe outside the field to understand of what are the actual methodologies of looking

21:43.760 --> 21:48.560
 inside the human brain? Right. Well, you can answer that question from two perspectives. Basically,

21:48.560 --> 21:54.800
 it's the modality. What kind of signal are you measuring? And they can range from,

21:55.760 --> 22:02.000
 let's limit ourselves to sort of imaging based noninvasive techniques. So you've essentially

22:02.000 --> 22:06.560
 got brain scanners. And brain scanners can either measure the structural attributes,

22:06.560 --> 22:10.240
 the amount of water, the amount of fat or the amount of iron in different parts of the brain.

22:10.240 --> 22:15.600
 And you can make lots of inferences about the structure of the organ of the sort that you

22:15.600 --> 22:22.320
 might abduce from an x ray, but a very nuanced x ray that is looking at this kind of property

22:22.320 --> 22:28.720
 and that kind of property. So looking at the anatomy noninvasively is would be the first

22:28.720 --> 22:34.880
 sort of neuroimaging that people might want to employ. Then you move on to the kinds of measurements

22:34.880 --> 22:42.880
 that reflect dynamic function. The most prevalent of those fall into two camps, you've got these

22:43.760 --> 22:52.400
 metabolic sometimes hemodynamic blood related signals. So these metabolic and or hemodynamic

22:52.400 --> 23:03.360
 signals are basically proxies for elevated activity and message passing and neuronal dynamics,

23:03.360 --> 23:08.160
 in particular parts of the brain. Characteristically though, the time constants of these

23:09.040 --> 23:15.200
 hemodynamic or metabolic responses to neural activity are much longer than the neural activity

23:15.200 --> 23:21.760
 itself. And this is referring, forgive me for the dumb questions, but this would be referring to

23:22.320 --> 23:27.200
 blood like the flow of blood. Absolutely. So there's a ton of, it seems like there's a ton

23:27.200 --> 23:33.920
 of blood vessels in the brain. So what's the interaction between the flow of blood and the

23:33.920 --> 23:42.080
 function of the neurons? Is there an interplay there? And that interplay accounts for several

23:42.080 --> 23:48.480
 careers of world renowned scientists. Yes, absolutely. So this is known as neurovascular

23:48.480 --> 23:53.360
 coupling is exactly what you said. It's how does the neural activity, the neural infrastructure,

23:53.360 --> 24:00.160
 the actual message passing that we think underlies our capacity to perceive and act?

24:01.120 --> 24:09.760
 How is that coupled to the vascular responses that supply the energy for that neural processing?

24:09.760 --> 24:15.840
 So there's a delicate web of large vessels, arteries and veins, that gets progressively

24:15.840 --> 24:22.240
 finer and finer in detail until it perfuses at a microscopic level, the machinery where

24:22.240 --> 24:26.160
 little neurons lie. So coming back to this sort of onion perspective,

24:27.200 --> 24:32.320
 we were talking before using the onion as a metaphor for a deep hierarchical structure,

24:32.320 --> 24:38.960
 but also I think it's just anatomical, anatomically quite a useful metaphor. All the action,

24:38.960 --> 24:42.960
 all the heavy lifting in terms of neural computation is done on the surface of the brain.

24:42.960 --> 24:52.800
 And then the interior of the brain is constituted by fatty wires, essentially external processes

24:52.800 --> 24:59.040
 that are enshrouded by myelin sheaths. And these give the, when you dissect them, they look fatty

24:59.040 --> 25:04.560
 and white. And so it's called white matter, as opposed to the actual neuro pill, which does the

25:04.560 --> 25:09.520
 computation constituted largely by neurons. And that's known as gray matter. So the gray matter

25:09.520 --> 25:17.920
 is a surface or a skin that sits on top of this big ball, now we are talking magic soup, but it's

25:18.560 --> 25:22.960
 big ball of connections like spaghetti, very carefully structured with sparse connectivity

25:22.960 --> 25:28.160
 that preserves this deep hierarchical structure. But all the action takes place on the surface,

25:28.160 --> 25:38.400
 on the cortex of the onion. And that means that you have to supply the right amount of blood flow,

25:38.400 --> 25:45.520
 the right amount of nutrient, which is rapidly absorbed and used by neural cells that don't

25:45.520 --> 25:52.400
 have the same capacity that your leg muscles would have to basically spend their energy budget and

25:52.400 --> 25:59.280
 then claim it back later. So one peculiar thing about cerebral metabolism, brain metabolism,

25:59.840 --> 26:04.080
 is it really needs to be driven in the moment, which means you basically have to turn on the taps.

26:04.080 --> 26:11.840
 So if there's lots of neural activity in one part of the brain, a little patch of a few millimeters,

26:12.400 --> 26:18.480
 even less possibly, you really do have to water that piece of the garden now and quickly. And

26:18.480 --> 26:23.200
 that by quickly, I mean within a couple of seconds. So that contains a lot of that.

26:24.160 --> 26:31.280
 Hence the imaging could tell you a story of what's happening. Absolutely. But it is slightly

26:31.280 --> 26:37.760
 compromised in terms of the resolution. So the deployment of these little micro vessels that

26:37.760 --> 26:45.200
 water the garden to enable the activity to the neural activity to play out. The spatial resolution

26:45.200 --> 26:51.200
 is in order of a few millimeters. And crucially, the temporal resolution is the order of a few

26:51.200 --> 26:57.360
 seconds. So you can't get right down and dirty into the actual spatial and temporal scale of

26:57.360 --> 27:01.920
 neural activity in and of itself. To do that, you'd have to turn to the other big imaging

27:01.920 --> 27:07.600
 modality, which is the recording of electromagnetic signals as they're generated in real time.

27:07.600 --> 27:12.880
 So here the temporal bandwidth, if you like, or the low limit on the temporal resolution

27:12.880 --> 27:18.400
 is incredibly small. You're talking about, you know, Nala seconds, milliseconds. And then you

27:18.400 --> 27:29.600
 can get into the phasic fast responses that is in of itself the neural activity and start to

27:30.320 --> 27:36.240
 see the succession or cascade of hierarchical recurrent message passing evoked by a particular

27:36.240 --> 27:42.720
 stimulus. But the problem is you're looking at electromagnetic signals that have passed through

27:42.720 --> 27:50.640
 an enormous amount of magic soup or spaghetti of collectivity and through the scalp and the skull.

27:50.640 --> 27:54.800
 And it's become spatially very diffuse. It's very difficult to know where you are.

27:54.800 --> 28:00.880
 So you've got this sort of catch 22. You can either use an imaging modality. It tells you

28:00.880 --> 28:06.800
 within millimeters, which part of the brain is activated, we don't know when. Or you've got these

28:06.800 --> 28:17.200
 electromagnetic EEG MEG setups that tell you to within a few milliseconds when something has

28:17.200 --> 28:24.640
 responded, be aware. So you've got these two complementary measures, either indirect via

28:24.640 --> 28:31.200
 the blood flow or direct via the electromagnetic signals caused by neural activity. These are

28:31.200 --> 28:37.440
 the two big imaging devices. And then the second level of responding to your question, what are

28:37.440 --> 28:45.040
 the, you know, from the outside, what are the big ways of using this technology? So once you've

28:45.040 --> 28:51.040
 chosen the kind of neuroimaging they want to use to answer your set questions, and sometimes it would

28:51.040 --> 28:59.840
 have to be both. Then you've got a whole raft of analyses, time series analyses, usually that you

28:59.840 --> 29:06.880
 can bring to bear in order to answer your questions or address your hypotheses about those data.

29:06.880 --> 29:10.880
 And interestingly, they've both fallen to the same two camps we're talking about before,

29:10.880 --> 29:17.040
 you know, this dialectic between specialization and integration, differentiation and integration.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.080
 So it's the cartography, the blobology analyses.

29:20.720 --> 29:24.640
 I apologize. I probably shouldn't interrupt so much, but just heard a fun word.

29:24.640 --> 29:32.000
 The blobology. It's a neologism, which means the study of blobs.

29:34.320 --> 29:39.440
 Are you being woody and humorous? Or is there an actual, does the word blobology ever appear

29:39.440 --> 29:44.960
 in a textbook somewhere? It would appear in a popular book. It would not appear in a worthy

29:46.560 --> 29:53.920
 specialist journal. But it's the fond word for the study of literally little blobs on

29:53.920 --> 29:59.520
 brain maps showing activations. So the kind of thing that you'd see in the newspapers on

30:00.720 --> 30:08.480
 ABC or BBC reporting the latest finding from brain imaging. Interestingly, though, the maths

30:08.480 --> 30:16.880
 involved in that stream of analysis does actually call upon the mathematics of blobs.

30:16.880 --> 30:25.600
 So seriously, they're actually called Euler characteristics and they have a lot of fancy

30:25.600 --> 30:26.800
 names in mathematics.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.560
 We'll talk about it, but your ideas in free energy principle, I mean,

30:30.560 --> 30:37.920
 there's a echoes of blobs there when you consider sort of entities, so mathematically speaking.

30:37.920 --> 30:44.400
 Yes, absolutely. Well, circumscribed, well defined. You entities of,

30:44.400 --> 30:50.320
 well, from the free energy point of view, entities of anything, but from the point of view of

30:51.440 --> 30:58.640
 the analysis, the cartography of the brain. These are the entities that constitute the

30:58.640 --> 31:04.400
 evidence for this functional segregation. You have segregated this function in this blob,

31:04.400 --> 31:10.800
 and it is not outside of the blob. And that's basically the, if you were a map maker of America

31:10.800 --> 31:17.520
 and you did not know its structure, the first thing you're doing constituting or creating a map

31:17.520 --> 31:23.040
 would be to identify the cities, for example, or the mountains or the rivers. All of these

31:23.040 --> 31:30.560
 uniquely spatially localizable features, possibly topological features, have to be placed somewhere

31:30.560 --> 31:35.920
 because that requires a mathematics of identifying what does a city look like on the satellite image

31:35.920 --> 31:41.680
 or what does a river look like or what does a mountain look like. What would it, what data

31:41.680 --> 31:48.960
 features would it, would evidence that particular top, that particular thing that you wanted to

31:48.960 --> 31:54.800
 put on the map. And they normally are characterized in terms of literally these blobs or these sort of,

31:55.600 --> 32:02.800
 now the way of looking at this is that a certain statistical measure of the degree of activation

32:02.800 --> 32:09.520
 crosses a threshold and in crossing that threshold in the spatially restricted part of the brain,

32:09.520 --> 32:14.640
 it creates a blob. And that's basically what statistical parametric mapping does. It's basically

32:16.000 --> 32:23.280
 mathematically finessed blobology. Okay, so those, you kind of describe these two methodologies for

32:23.920 --> 32:28.960
 one is temporally noisy, one is spatially noisy, and you kind of have to play and figure out what

32:28.960 --> 32:34.800
 can be useful. It'd be great if you can sort of comment, I got a chance recently to spend a day

32:34.800 --> 32:40.480
 at a company called Neuralink that uses brain computer interfaces. And their dream is to,

32:42.000 --> 32:47.680
 well, there's a bunch of sort of dreams, but one of them is to understand the brain by sort of,

32:49.120 --> 32:54.400
 you know, getting in there past the so called sort of factory while getting in there and be

32:54.400 --> 32:59.920
 able to listen, communicate both directions. What are your thoughts about this, the future of this

32:59.920 --> 33:07.280
 kind of technology of brain computer interfaces to be able to now have a, have a window or direct

33:07.280 --> 33:11.360
 contact within the brain to be able to measure some of the signals to be able to send signals to

33:11.360 --> 33:18.080
 understand some of the functionality of the brain. I'm bivalent. My sense is ambivalent. So it's a

33:18.080 --> 33:23.760
 mixture of good and bad. And I acknowledge that freely. So the good bits, if you just look at

33:23.760 --> 33:32.960
 the legacy of that kind of reciprocal but invasive brain stimulation, I didn't paint a complete picture

33:32.960 --> 33:36.960
 when I was talking about some of the ways we understand the brain prior to neuroimaging.

33:36.960 --> 33:42.720
 It wasn't just lesion deficit studies. Some of the early work, in fact, literally 100 yards from

33:42.720 --> 33:49.840
 where we're sitting at the Institute of Neurology was done by stimulating the brain of, say, dogs

33:49.840 --> 33:58.320
 and looking at how they responded with their muscles or with their salivation. And imputing

33:58.320 --> 34:05.200
 what that part of the brain must be doing that if I stimulate it and I vote this kind of response,

34:05.840 --> 34:09.760
 then that tells me quite a lot about the functional specialization. So there's a long

34:09.760 --> 34:16.000
 history of brain stimulation, which continues to enjoy a lot of attention nowadays.

34:16.000 --> 34:23.440
 Oh, yes, absolutely. Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease is now a standard treatment

34:23.440 --> 34:30.400
 and also a wonderful vehicle to try and understand the neuronal dynamics underlie movement disorders

34:30.400 --> 34:38.800
 like Parkinson's disease. Even interest in magnetic stimulation, stimulating the magnetic

34:38.800 --> 34:44.000
 fields and will it work in people who are depressed, for example? Quite a crude level

34:44.000 --> 34:50.160
 of understanding what you're doing. But there is historical evidence that these kinds of

34:50.160 --> 34:57.280
 brute thought interventions do change things. A little bit like banging the TV when the valves

34:57.280 --> 35:04.960
 aren't working properly, but it still works. So there is a long history. Brain computer

35:04.960 --> 35:12.240
 interfacing or BCI, I think is a beautiful example of that. It's sort of carved out its own

35:12.240 --> 35:18.400
 niche and its own aspirations and there have been enormous advances within limits.

35:20.640 --> 35:28.320
 Advances in terms of our ability to understand how the brain, the embodied brain,

35:29.760 --> 35:36.480
 engages with the world. I'm thinking here of sensory substitution, the augmenting our sensory

35:36.480 --> 35:44.400
 capacities by giving ourselves extra ways of sensing and sampling the world, ranging from

35:44.400 --> 35:50.240
 sort of trying to replace lost visual signals through to giving people completely new signals.

35:54.480 --> 35:58.960
 One of the, I think, most engaging examples of this is equipping people with a sense of

35:58.960 --> 36:05.280
 magnetic fields. So you can actually give them magnetic sensors that enable them to feel,

36:05.280 --> 36:12.080
 should we say, tactile pressure around their tummy, where they are in relation to the magnetic

36:12.080 --> 36:18.400
 field of the earth. And after a few weeks, they take it for granted, they integrate it,

36:18.400 --> 36:24.000
 they embody this, simulate this new sensory information into the way that they literally

36:24.000 --> 36:30.400
 feel their world, but now equipped with this sense of magnetic direction. So that tells you

36:30.400 --> 36:39.680
 something about the brain's plastic potential to remodel and its plastic capacity to suddenly

36:40.320 --> 36:49.040
 try to explain the sensory data at hand by augmenting the sensory sphere and the kinds of

36:49.040 --> 36:56.080
 things that you can measure. Clearly, that's purely for entertainment and understanding the

36:56.080 --> 37:04.240
 other nature and the power of our brains. I would imagine that most BCI is pitched at solving

37:05.280 --> 37:13.360
 clinical and human problems such as locked in syndrome, such as paraplegia, or replacing lost

37:14.480 --> 37:23.360
 sensory capacities like blindness and deafness. So then we come to the more negative part of my

37:23.360 --> 37:31.360
 ambivalence, the other side of it. So I don't want to be deflationary because

37:31.360 --> 37:37.200
 much of my deflationary comments are probably large out of ignorance than anything else. But

37:39.120 --> 37:44.560
 generally speaking, the bandwidth and the bit rates that you get from

37:45.600 --> 37:50.720
 brain computer interfaces as we currently know them, we're talking about bits per second.

37:50.720 --> 37:58.480
 So that would be like me only being able to communicate with any world or with you using very,

37:59.600 --> 38:14.560
 very, very slow Morse code. And it is not even within an order of magnitude near what we actually

38:14.560 --> 38:23.520
 need for an inactive realization of what people aspire to when they think about sort of curing

38:23.520 --> 38:31.600
 people with paraplegia or replacing sight, despite heroic efforts. So one has to ask,

38:31.600 --> 38:43.440
 is there a lower bound on the kinds of recurrent information exchange between a brain and some

38:43.440 --> 38:52.080
 augmented or artificial interface? And then we come back to, interestingly, what I was talking

38:52.080 --> 38:59.200
 about before, which is if you're talking about function in terms of inference, and I presume

38:59.200 --> 39:04.000
 we'll get to that later on in terms of the free energy principle, then the moment there may be

39:04.000 --> 39:08.640
 fundamental reasons to assume that is the case, we're talking about ensemble activity, we're

39:08.640 --> 39:19.440
 talking about basically, for example, let's paint the challenge facing brain computer

39:19.440 --> 39:26.960
 interfacing in terms of controlling another system that is highly and deeply structured,

39:26.960 --> 39:34.320
 very relevant to our lives, very nonlinear, that rests upon the kind of non equilibrium

39:34.320 --> 39:41.200
 steady states and dynamics that the brain does, the weather. So good example, yeah.

39:41.200 --> 39:48.240
 Imagine you had some very aggressive satellites that could produce signals that could perturb

39:48.240 --> 39:54.320
 some little parts of the of the weather system. And then what you're asking now is,

39:55.040 --> 40:00.400
 can I meaningfully get into the weather and change it meaningfully and make the weather

40:00.400 --> 40:07.600
 respond in a way that I want it to, you're talking about chaos control on a scale, which is almost

40:07.600 --> 40:16.160
 unimaginable. So there may be fundamental reasons why BCI, as you might read about it in a science

40:16.160 --> 40:26.880
 fiction novel, aspirational BCI may never actually work in the sense that to really be integrated

40:26.880 --> 40:35.040
 and be part of the system is a requirement that requires you to have evolved with that system.

40:38.000 --> 40:46.640
 You have to be part of a very delicately structured, deeply structured dynamic ensemble

40:46.640 --> 40:53.600
 activity that is not like rewiring a broken computer or plugging in a peripheral interface

40:53.600 --> 40:59.600
 adapter. It is much more like getting into the weather patterns or a come back to your magic

40:59.600 --> 41:07.040
 soup is getting into the active matter and meaningfully relate that to the outside world.

41:07.040 --> 41:12.400
 So I think there are enormous challenges there. So I think the example of the weather is a brilliant

41:12.400 --> 41:17.280
 one. And I think you paint a really interesting picture. And it wasn't as negative as I thought.

41:17.280 --> 41:21.920
 It's essentially saying that it's it might be incredibly challenging, including the low bound

41:21.920 --> 41:28.560
 of the bandwidth and so on. So just to full disclosure, I come from the machine learning world.

41:28.560 --> 41:34.400
 So my natural thought is the hardest part is the engineering challenge of controlling the

41:34.400 --> 41:39.760
 weather, of getting those satellites up and running and so on. And once they are, then the rest

41:39.760 --> 41:47.520
 is fundamentally the same approaches that allow you to win in the game of go will allow you to

41:47.520 --> 41:53.600
 potentially play in this soup in this chaos. So I have I have a hope that sort of machine

41:53.600 --> 42:04.080
 learning methods will will help us play in this soup. But perhaps you're right that it is a biology

42:04.080 --> 42:12.080
 in the brain is just an incredible, incredible system that may be almost impossible to get in.

42:12.080 --> 42:20.240
 But for me, what seems impossible is is the incredible mess of blood vessels that you also

42:20.240 --> 42:26.080
 described without, you know, we also value the brain. You can't make any mistakes. You can't

42:26.080 --> 42:32.160
 damage things. So to me, that engineering challenge seems nearly impossible. One of the things I was

42:32.160 --> 42:40.400
 really impressed by at Neuralink is just just talking to brilliant neurosurgeons and the roboticists

42:40.400 --> 42:47.600
 that made me realize that even though it seems impossible, if anyone can do it, it's some of

42:47.600 --> 42:54.240
 these world class engineers that are trying to take it on. So so I think the conclusion of our

42:54.240 --> 43:01.600
 discussion here is of this part is basically that the problem is really hard, but hopefully not

43:01.600 --> 43:11.040
 impossible. Absolutely. So if it's okay, let's start with the basics. So you've also formulated a

43:11.040 --> 43:16.640
 fascinating principle, the free energy principle. Can we maybe start at the basics and what is

43:17.280 --> 43:21.920
 the free energy principle? Well, in fact, the free energy principle

43:21.920 --> 43:33.520
 inherits a lot from the building of these data analytic approaches to these very high dimensional

43:33.520 --> 43:38.080
 time series you get get from the brain. So I think it's interesting to acknowledge that. And in

43:38.080 --> 43:43.680
 particular, the analysis tools that try to address the other side, which is the functional

43:43.680 --> 43:51.920
 integrations and the connectivity analysis. On the one hand, but I should also acknowledge it

43:51.920 --> 44:01.200
 inherits an awful lot from machine learning as well. So the free energy principle is just a

44:01.200 --> 44:10.160
 formal statement that the existential imperatives are any system that manages to survive in a

44:10.160 --> 44:21.120
 changing world is can be cast as an inference problem, in the sense that you can interpret

44:21.120 --> 44:28.000
 the probability of existing as the evidence that you exist. And if you can write down that problem

44:28.000 --> 44:33.200
 of existence as a statistical problem, then you can use all the maths that has been developed

44:33.200 --> 44:43.200
 for inference to understand and characterize the ensemble dynamics that must be in play in the

44:43.200 --> 44:49.760
 service of that inference. So technically, what that means is you can always interpret anything

44:49.760 --> 44:59.360
 that exists in virtue of being separate from the environment in which it exists as trying to

44:59.360 --> 45:05.760
 minimize variational free energy. And if you're from the machine learning community, you will

45:05.760 --> 45:13.040
 know that as a negative evidence lower bound or a negative elbow, which is the same as saying

45:13.040 --> 45:20.000
 you're trying to maximize or it will look as if all your dynamics are trying to maximize the

45:20.960 --> 45:26.720
 complement of that which is the marginal likelihood or the evidence for your own existence. So that's

45:26.720 --> 45:34.000
 basically the free energy principle. But to even take a sort of a small step backwards,

45:34.000 --> 45:41.280
 you said the existential imperative. There's a lot of beautiful poetic words here, but to put

45:41.280 --> 45:50.240
 it crudely, it's a fascinating idea of basically just of trying to describe if you're looking at a

45:50.240 --> 45:56.240
 blob, how do you know this thing is alive? What does it mean to be alive? What does it mean to

45:56.240 --> 46:01.520
 be to exist? And so you can look at the brain, you can look at parts of the brain or you this is

46:01.520 --> 46:08.560
 just a general principle that applies to almost any system. That's just a fascinating sort of

46:08.560 --> 46:14.160
 philosophically at every level question and a methodology to try to answer that question.

46:14.160 --> 46:22.240
 What does it mean to be alive? Yes. So that's a huge endeavor and it's nice that there's at least

46:22.240 --> 46:27.600
 some from some perspective a clean answer. So maybe can you talk about that optimization

46:28.800 --> 46:35.440
 view of it? So what's trying to be minimized to maximize a system that's alive? What is it trying

46:35.440 --> 46:43.680
 to minimize? Right, you've made a big move there. First of all, it's good to make big moves.

46:43.680 --> 46:53.760
 But you've assumed that the things, the thing exists in a state that could be living or non

46:53.760 --> 47:00.720
 living. So I may ask you, what licenses you to say that something exists? That's why I use the

47:00.720 --> 47:07.920
 word existential. It's beyond living, it's just existence. So if you drill down onto the definition

47:07.920 --> 47:16.960
 of things that exist, then they have certain properties. If you borrow the maths from non

47:16.960 --> 47:27.600
 equilibrium steady state physics that enable you to interpret their existence in terms of this

47:27.600 --> 47:35.040
 optimization procedure. So it's good you introduce the word optimization. So what the free energy

47:35.040 --> 47:45.280
 principle in its sort of most ambitious but also most deflationary and simplest says is that if

47:45.280 --> 47:58.560
 something exists, then it must buy the mathematics of non equilibrium steady state exhibit properties

47:58.560 --> 48:05.120
 that make it look as if it is optimizing a particular quantity. And it turns out that particular

48:05.120 --> 48:11.280
 quantity happens to be exactly the same as the evidence lower bound in machine learning,

48:11.280 --> 48:19.280
 or Bayesian model evidence in Bayesian statistics, or I can list a whole other list of ways of

48:19.280 --> 48:29.200
 understanding this key quantity, which is abound on surprises, self information, if you

48:29.760 --> 48:34.560
 know information theory, there are a number of different perspectives on this quantity.

48:34.560 --> 48:41.680
 It's just basically the log probability of being in a particular state. I'm telling this story

48:41.680 --> 48:49.200
 as an honest attempt to answer your question. And I'm answering it as if I was pretending

48:49.200 --> 48:56.720
 to be a physicist who was trying to understand the fundamentals of non equilibrium steady state.

48:57.840 --> 49:03.120
 And I shouldn't really be doing that because the last time I was taught physics, I was in my 20s.

49:03.680 --> 49:07.040
 What kind of systems when you think about the free energy principle, what kind of systems

49:07.040 --> 49:10.720
 are you imagining as a sort of more specific kind of case study?

49:10.720 --> 49:21.920
 Yeah, I'm imagining a range of systems, but at its simplest, a single celled organism

49:23.360 --> 49:30.400
 that can be identified from its eco niche or its environment. So at its simplest,

49:30.400 --> 49:37.280
 that's basically what I always imagined in my head. And you may ask, well, how on earth

49:37.280 --> 49:46.560
 can you even elaborate questions about the existence of a single drop of oil, for example?

49:48.240 --> 49:54.800
 But there are deep questions there. Why doesn't the thing, the interface between the drop of oil

49:55.360 --> 50:02.240
 that contains an interior and the thing that is not the drop of oil, which is the solvent in

50:02.240 --> 50:09.120
 which it is immersed? How does that interface persist over time? Why doesn't the oil just dissolve

50:09.120 --> 50:18.560
 into solvent? So what's special properties of the exchange between the surface of the oil drop

50:18.560 --> 50:23.840
 and the external states in which it's immersed? If you're a physicist, say it would be the heat

50:23.840 --> 50:29.360
 path. You've got a physical system, an ensemble again, we're talking about density dynamics,

50:29.360 --> 50:36.480
 ensemble dynamics, an ensemble of atoms or molecules immersed in the heat path. But the

50:36.480 --> 50:41.200
 question is, how did the heat path get there? And why is it not dissolved?

50:41.200 --> 50:46.400
 How's it maintaining itself? Exactly. What actions is it? I mean, it's such a fascinating idea of a

50:46.400 --> 50:52.160
 drop of oil and I guess it would dissolve in water. It wouldn't dissolve in water. So what?

50:52.160 --> 50:57.120
 Precisely. So why not? So why not? Why not? And how do you mathematically describe it? I mean,

50:57.120 --> 51:06.080
 it's such a beautiful idea and also the idea of where does the drop of oil end and where does it

51:06.080 --> 51:12.480
 begin? Right. So I mean, you're asking deep questions, deep in a non millennial sense here.

51:16.320 --> 51:23.200
 But what you can do, so this is a deflationary part of it. Can I just qualify my answer by

51:23.200 --> 51:26.640
 saying that normally when I'm asked this question, I answer from the point of view of a psychologist

51:26.640 --> 51:31.120
 when we talk about predictive processing and predictive coding and the brain as an inference

51:31.120 --> 51:35.360
 machine. But you have asked me from that perspective, I'm answering from the point of view of a

51:35.360 --> 51:44.480
 physicist. So the question is not so much why, but if it exists, what properties must it display?

51:44.480 --> 51:48.320
 So that's the deflationary part of the free energy principle. The free energy principle

51:48.320 --> 51:56.480
 does not supply an answer as to why. It's saying, if something exists, then it must display these

51:56.480 --> 52:04.080
 properties. That's the thing that's on offer. And it so happens that these properties, it must

52:04.080 --> 52:13.360
 display are actually intriguing and have this inferential gloss, this sort of self evidencing

52:13.360 --> 52:20.640
 gloss that inherits on the fact that the very preservation of the boundary between the oil

52:20.640 --> 52:27.040
 drop and the not oil drop requires an optimization of a particular function or a functional

52:28.160 --> 52:34.320
 that defines the presence of the existence of this oil drop, which is why I started with

52:34.320 --> 52:40.800
 existential imperatives. It is a necessary condition for existence that this must occur,

52:40.800 --> 52:47.600
 because the boundary basically defines the thing that's existing. So it is that self assembly

52:47.600 --> 52:58.400
 aspect that you were hinting at in biology, sometimes known as auto poesis in computational

52:58.400 --> 53:06.160
 chemistry with self assembly. What does it look like? Sorry, how would you describe things that

53:06.160 --> 53:14.640
 configure themselves out of nothing? The way they clearly demarcate themselves from the states or the

53:14.640 --> 53:22.160
 soup in which they are immersed. So from the point of view of computational chemistry, for example,

53:22.160 --> 53:27.040
 you would just understand that as a configuration of a macromolecule to minimize its free energy,

53:27.040 --> 53:31.520
 its thermodynamic free energy. It's exactly the same principle that we've been talking about,

53:31.520 --> 53:38.240
 that thermodynamic free energy is just the negative elbow. It's the same mathematical construct.

53:38.240 --> 53:45.120
 So the very emergence of existence, of structure, of form that can be distinguished from the environment

53:45.120 --> 53:56.480
 or the thing that is not the thing necessitates the existence of an objective function that it

53:56.480 --> 54:02.320
 looks as if it is minimizing. It's finding a free energy minima. And so just to clarify,

54:02.320 --> 54:09.680
 I'm trying to wrap my head around, so the free energy principle says that if something exists,

54:09.680 --> 54:18.880
 these are the properties it should display. So what that means is we can't just go into a soup

54:19.600 --> 54:24.880
 and there's no mechanism. A free energy principle doesn't give us a mechanism to find the things

54:24.880 --> 54:35.120
 that exist. Is that what's implying is being applied that you can use it to reason, to think about

54:36.000 --> 54:40.160
 study a particular system and say, does this exhibit these qualities?

54:41.760 --> 54:46.880
 That's an excellent question. But to answer that, I'd have to return to your previous question

54:46.880 --> 54:49.600
 about what's the difference between living and nonliving things.

54:49.600 --> 54:58.000
 Yes, actually, sorry. So yeah, maybe we can go there. You drew a line, and forgive me for

54:58.000 --> 55:02.960
 the stupid questions, but you drew a line between living and existing. Is there an

55:03.600 --> 55:15.680
 interesting distinction? I think there is. So things do exist, grains of sand, rocks on the

55:15.680 --> 55:25.120
 moon, trees, you. So all of these things can be separated from the environment in which

55:25.120 --> 55:30.960
 they are immersed. And therefore, they must at some level be optimizing their free energy,

55:32.160 --> 55:38.160
 taking this sort of model evidence interpretation of this quantity that basically means they're

55:38.160 --> 55:44.480
 self evidencing. Another nice little twist of phrase here is that you are your own existence

55:44.480 --> 55:51.120
 proof. And statistically speaking, which I don't think I said that, somebody did, but I love that

55:51.120 --> 55:57.760
 phrase. You are your own existence proof. Yeah. So it's so existential, isn't it?

55:59.040 --> 56:05.440
 I'm going to have to think about that for a few days. That's a beautiful line.

56:06.000 --> 56:11.200
 So the step through to answer your question about what's it good for,

56:11.200 --> 56:19.600
 well, we go along the following lines. First of all, you have to define what it means to exist,

56:19.600 --> 56:24.960
 which down as you've rightly pointed out, you have to define what probabilistic properties

56:24.960 --> 56:31.040
 must the states of something possess so that it has so it knows where it finishes. And then you

56:31.040 --> 56:37.600
 write down that down in terms of statistical independence is again sparsity. Again, it's not

56:37.600 --> 56:41.680
 what's connected or what's correlated or what depends upon what it's what's not

56:42.800 --> 56:49.680
 correlated and what doesn't depend upon something. Again, it comes down to the deep structures,

56:49.680 --> 56:54.880
 not in this instance hierarchical, but the certainly the structures that emerge from removing

56:54.880 --> 57:01.440
 connectivity and dependency. And in this instance, basically being able to identify the surface of

57:01.440 --> 57:09.200
 the oil drop from the water in which it is immersed. And when you do that, you start to realise, well,

57:09.200 --> 57:15.520
 there are actually four kinds of states in any given universe that contains anything,

57:15.520 --> 57:20.720
 the things that are internal to the surface, the things that are external to the surface and

57:20.720 --> 57:25.440
 the surface in and of itself, which is why I use a metaphor, a little single celled organism that

57:25.440 --> 57:32.000
 has an interior and exterior and then the surface of the cell. And that's mathematically a Markov

57:32.000 --> 57:36.720
 blanket. Just to pause, I'm in awe of this concept that there's the stuff outside the surface stuff

57:36.720 --> 57:42.720
 inside the surface and the surface itself, the Markov blanket. It's just the most beautiful

57:42.720 --> 57:48.720
 kind of notion about trying to explore what it means to exist, mathematically. I apologize,

57:48.720 --> 57:57.040
 this is the beautiful idea. I came out of California. I changed my mind. I take it all back. So

57:58.720 --> 58:01.280
 you were just talking about the surface, about the Markov blanket.

58:01.280 --> 58:05.920
 So this surface or this blanket, these blanket states that are the

58:05.920 --> 58:20.800
 because they are now defined in relation to these dependencies and what different states internal

58:20.800 --> 58:26.640
 or blanket or external states can, which ones can influence each other and which cannot influence

58:26.640 --> 58:33.440
 each other, you can now apply standard results that you would find in non equilibrium physics

58:33.440 --> 58:42.000
 or steady state or thermodynamics or hydrodynamics, usually out of equilibrium solutions and apply

58:42.000 --> 58:48.080
 them to this partition. And what it looks like is if all the normal, normal gradient flows that

58:48.080 --> 58:56.560
 you would associate with any non equilibrium system, apply in such a way that two part of the

58:56.560 --> 59:03.760
 Markov blanket and the internal states seem to be hill climbing or doing a gradient descent on

59:03.760 --> 59:12.080
 the same quantity. And that means that you can now describe the very existence of this oil drop.

59:12.960 --> 59:19.760
 You can write down the existence of this oil drop in terms of flows, dynamics, equations of motion

59:19.760 --> 59:27.040
 where the blanket states or part of them, we call them active states and the internal states

59:28.000 --> 59:35.280
 now seem to be and must be trying to look as if they're minimizing the same function,

59:35.280 --> 59:40.080
 which is a lot of probability of occupying these states. The interesting thing is that

59:42.400 --> 59:45.680
 what would they be called if you were trying to describe these things? So

59:45.680 --> 59:52.400
 what we're talking about are internal states, external states and blanket states. Now let's

59:52.400 --> 59:58.400
 carve the blanket states into two sensory states and active states. Operationally, it has to be

59:58.400 --> 1:00:05.360
 the case that in order for this carving up into different sets of states to exist, the active

1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:10.480
 states, the Markov blanket cannot be influenced by the external states. And we already know

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:15.040
 that the internal states can't be influenced by the external states because the blanket separates

1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:20.000
 them. So what does that mean? Well, it means the active states, the internal states are now

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:26.800
 jointly not influenced by external states. They only have autonomous dynamics. So now you've got

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:34.800
 a picture of an oil drop that has autonomy. It has autonomous states. It has autonomous states

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:39.280
 in the sense that there must be some parts of the surface of the oil drop that are not influenced

1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:44.720
 by the external states and all the interior. And together, those two states endow even a

1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:52.320
 little oil drop with autonomous states that look as if they are optimizing their variational free

1:00:52.320 --> 1:01:01.760
 energy or their negative elbow, their model evidence. And that would be an interesting

1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:06.400
 intellectual exercise. And you could say you could even go into the realms of panpsychism,

1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:11.760
 that everything that exists is implicitly making inferences on self evidencing.

1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:19.120
 Now, we make the next move. But what about living things? I mean, so let me ask you,

1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:26.240
 what's the difference between an oil drop and a little tadpole or a little lava or plankton?

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:32.720
 The picture was just painted of an oil drop. Just immediately, in a matter of minutes,

1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:38.960
 took me into the world of panpsychism, where you just convinced me, made me feel like an

1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:45.440
 oil drop is a living, certainly an autonomous system, but almost a living system. So it has

1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:51.840
 a sensor capabilities and acting capabilities and it maintains something. So what is the

1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:57.280
 difference between that and something that we traditionally think of as a living system?

1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:05.680
 That it could die? Or it can't, I mean, yeah, mortality? I'm not exactly sure. I'm not sure

1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:11.280
 what the right answer there is, because it can move, like movement seems like an essential

1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:16.320
 element to being able to act in the environment, but the oil drop is doing that. So I don't know.

1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:21.920
 Is it? The oil drop will be moved, but does it in and of itself move autonomously?

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:29.520
 Well, the surface is performing actions that maintain its structure.

1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:35.360
 Yeah, you're being too clever. I had in mind a passive little oil drop that's sitting there.

1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:39.120
 Yeah. At the bottom of the top of a glass of water.

1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:40.400
 Sure, I guess.

1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:45.040
 What I'm trying to say is you're absolutely right. You've nailed it. It's movement.

1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:48.480
 So where does that movement come from? If it comes from the inside,

1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:51.680
 then then you've got, I think, something that's living.

1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:54.480
 What do you mean from the inside?

1:02:54.480 --> 1:03:00.960
 What I mean is that the internal states that can influence the active states,

1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:05.040
 where the active states can influence, but they're not influenced by the external states,

1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:10.320
 can cause movement. So there are two types of oil drops, if you like.

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:20.240
 There are oil drops where the internal states are so random that they average themselves away,

1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:25.280
 and the thing cannot balance on average when you do the averaging move.

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:30.960
 So a nice example of that would be the sun. The sun certainly has internal states.

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:35.680
 There's lots of intrinsic autonomous activity going on, but because it's not coordinated,

1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:39.600
 because it doesn't have the deep in the millennial sense, a hierarchical structure that the brain

1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:48.000
 does, there is no overall mode or pattern or organization that expresses itself on the surface

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:55.440
 that allows it to actually swim. It can certainly have a very active surface, but on mass at the

1:03:55.440 --> 1:04:02.080
 scale of the actual surface of the sun, the average position of that surface cannot in itself move,

1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:08.400
 because the internal dynamics are more like a hot gas. They are literally like a hot gas,

1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:12.800
 whereas your internal dynamics are much more structured and deeply structured,

1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:17.440
 and now you can express on your mark of, on your active states with your muscles and

1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:22.880
 your secretory organs, your autonomic nervous system, and its effectors.

1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:28.160
 You can actually move, and that's all you can do. And that's something which, you know,

1:04:28.160 --> 1:04:33.280
 if you haven't thought of it like this before, I think it's nice to just realize there is no other

1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:40.320
 way that you can change the universe other than simply moving. Whether that moving is

1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:47.440
 articulating my, with my voice box, or walking around, or squeezing juices out of my secretory

1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:54.720
 organs, there's only one way you can change the universe. It's moving. And the fact that you do

1:04:54.720 --> 1:05:04.800
 so non randomly makes you alive. Yeah. So it's that non randomness. And that would be manifested,

1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:11.840
 we realize in terms of essentially swimming, essentially moving, changing one shape, a morphogenesis

1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:18.160
 that is dynamic, and possibly adaptive. So that that's what I was trying to get up between the

1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:22.880
 difference from the oil drop and the little tadpole, that the tadpole is moving around.

1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:28.400
 Its active states are actually changing the external states. And there's now a cycle,

1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:34.960
 an action perception cycle, if you like, a recurrent dynamic that's going on that depends upon this

1:05:34.960 --> 1:05:46.960
 deeply structured autonomous behavior that rests upon internal dynamics that are not only

1:05:47.600 --> 1:05:56.080
 modeling, the data impressed upon their surface or the blanket states, but they are actively

1:05:56.080 --> 1:06:02.240
 resampling those data by moving, they're moving towards chemical gradients and chemotaxis.

1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:11.280
 So they've gone beyond just being good little models of the kind of world they live in. For

1:06:11.280 --> 1:06:18.960
 example, an oil droplet could, in a panpsychic sense, be construed as a little being that has

1:06:18.960 --> 1:06:26.080
 now perfectly inferred. It's a passive non living oil drop living in a bowl of water. No problem.

1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:32.960
 But to now equip that oil drop with the ability to go out and test that hypothesis about different

1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:37.520
 states of beings, so you can actually push its surface over there, over there, and test for

1:06:37.520 --> 1:06:44.000
 chemical gradients, or then you start to move to much more lifelike form. This is all fun,

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:49.200
 theoretically interesting, but it actually is quite important in terms of reflecting what I

1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:57.360
 have seen since the turn of the millennium, which is this move towards an inactive and embodied

1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:05.360
 understanding of intelligence. And you say you're from machine learning. So what that means,

1:07:07.040 --> 1:07:14.960
 the central importance of movement, I think has yet to really hit machine learning. It certainly

1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:22.480
 has now diffused itself throughout robotics. And perhaps you could say certain problems in

1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:27.760
 active vision where you actually have to move the camera to sample this and that. But machine

1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:34.160
 learning of the data mining deep learning sort simply hasn't contended with this issue. What

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:39.280
 it's done instead of dealing with the movement problem and the active sampling of data, it's

1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:43.040
 just said, we don't need to worry about we can see all the data because we've got big data.

1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:51.840
 So we need to ignore movement. So that, for me, is an important omission in current machine

1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:57.120
 learning. The current machine learning is much more like the oil drop. Yes. But an oil drop that

1:07:57.120 --> 1:08:04.560
 enjoys exposure to nearly all the data it will ever need to be exposed to, as opposed to the

1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:11.200
 tapels swimming out to find the right data. For example, it likes food. That's a good hypothesis.

1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:17.120
 Let's test it out. Let's go and move and ingest food, for example, and see what that is that

1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:22.560
 evidence that I'm the kind of thing that likes this kind of food. So the next natural question,

1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:27.440
 and forgive this question, but if we think of sort of even artificial intelligence systems,

1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:37.280
 which has just painted a beautiful picture of existence and life. So do you ascribe,

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:46.400
 but do you find within this framework a possibility of defining consciousness or exploring the idea

1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:57.600
 of consciousness, like what self awareness and expanded to consciousness? How can we start

1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:00.240
 to think about consciousness within this framework? Is it possible?

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:06.240
 Well, I think it's possible to think about it, whether you'll get anywhere. It's another question.

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:13.520
 And again, I'm not sure that I'm licensed to answer that question. I think you'd have to

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:17.680
 speak to a qualified philosopher to get a definitive answer there. But certainly,

1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:24.800
 there's a lot of interest in using not just these ideas, but related ideas from information theory

1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:33.120
 to try and tie down the maths and the calculus and the geometry of consciousness,

1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:41.520
 either in terms of sort of a minimal consciousness, even less than a minimal

1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:50.880
 selfhood. And what I'm talking about is the ability effectively to plan, to have agency.

1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:59.040
 So you could argue that a virus does have a form of agency in virtue of the way that it selectively

1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:08.640
 finds hosts and cells to live in and moves around. But you wouldn't endow it with the capacity to think

1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:16.720
 about planning and moving in a purposeful way where it countens as the future. Whereas you might

1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:24.640
 an ant, you might think an ant's not quite as unconscious as a virus. It certainly seems to

1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:31.760
 have a purpose. It talks to its friends on route during its foraging. It has a different kind of

1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:38.000
 autonomy, which is biotic, but beyond a virus.

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:44.160
 So there's something about, so there's some line that has to do with the complexity of planning

1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:52.560
 that may contain an answer. I mean, it would be beautiful if we can find a line beyond which

1:10:52.560 --> 1:11:00.720
 we can say a being is conscious. These are wonderful lines that we've drawn with existence,

1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:07.680
 life and consciousness. It will be very nice. One little wrinkle there, and this is something

1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:11.520
 I've only learned in the past few months, is the philosophical notion of vagueness.

1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:17.680
 So you're saying it would be wonderful to draw a line. I had always assumed that that line at some

1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:24.720
 point would be drawn until about four months ago, and the philosopher taught me about vagueness.

1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:29.520
 So I don't know if you've come across this, but it's a technical concept and I think most

1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:36.080
 revealingly illustrated with at what point does a pile of sand become a pile?

1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:43.360
 Is it one grain, two grains, three grains or four grains? So at what point would you draw

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:51.920
 the line between being a pile of sand and a collection of grains of sand? In the same way,

1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:56.560
 is it right to ask, where would I draw the line between conscious and unconscious?

1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:01.280
 And it might be a vague concept. Having said that, I agree with you entirely.

1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:08.560
 So systems that have the ability to plan. So just technically what that means is

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:17.760
 your inferential self evidencing by which I simply mean the dynamics, literally the

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:23.920
 thermodynamics and gradient flows that underwrite the preservation of your oil droplet like form

1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:34.080
 are described as an optimization of log Bayesian model evidence, your elbow.

1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:44.560
 That self evidencing must be evidence for a model of what's causing the sensory impressions on the

1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:51.040
 sensory part of your surface or your Markov blanket. If that model is capable of planning,

1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:56.560
 it must include a model of the future consequences of your active states or your action just planning.

1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:00.400
 So we're now in the game of planning as inference. Now notice what we've made though.

1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:05.840
 We've made quite a big move away from big data and machine learning because again,

1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:11.440
 it's the consequences of moving. It's the consequences of selecting those data or those

1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:18.320
 data or looking over there. And that tells you immediately that even to be a contender for

1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:29.120
 a conscious artifact or a strong AI or general, then you've got to have movement in the game.

1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:34.560
 And furthermore, you've got to have a generative model of the sort you might find in say a variation

1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:41.680
 autoencoder that is thinking about the future conditioned upon different courses of action.

1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:45.200
 Now that brings a number of things to the table, which which now you start to think,

1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:49.040
 well, those have got all the right ingredients to talk about consciousness. I've now got to

1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:54.160
 select among a number of different courses of action into the future as part of planning.

1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:59.600
 I've now got free will. The act of selecting this course of action or that policy or that

1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:07.920
 policy or that action suddenly makes me into an inference machine, a self evidencing artifact

1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:14.160
 that now looks as if it's selecting amongst different alternative ways forward as I actively

1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:19.840
 swim here or swim there or look over here, look over there. So I think you've now got to a situation

1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:25.680
 if there is planning in the mix, you're now getting much closer to that line if that line

1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:31.760
 wherever to exist. I don't think it gets you quite as far as self aware, though. I think

1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:37.680
 and then you're you have to I think grapple with the question.

1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:45.040
 How would formally write down a calculus or a maths of self awareness? I don't think it's

1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:52.720
 impossible to do. But I think you would be pressure on you to actually commit to a formal

1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:59.440
 definition of what you mean by self awareness. I think most people that I know would probably

1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:08.320
 say that a goldfish, a pet fish was not self aware. They would probably argue about their

1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:13.360
 favorite cat, but would be quite happy to say that their mum was self aware.

1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:21.680
 But that might very well connect to some level of complexity with planning. It seems like

1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:26.320
 self awareness is essential for complex planning.

1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:29.200
 Yeah. Do you want to take that further? I think you're absolutely right.

1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:36.240
 Again, the line is unclear, but it seems like integrating yourself into the world,

1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:42.080
 into your planning, is essential for constructing complex plans.

1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:42.400
 Yes.

1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:49.120
 So mathematically describing that in the same elegant way as you have with the free energy

1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:51.040
 principle might be difficult.

1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:57.040
 Well, yes and no. I don't think that perhaps we should just, can we just go back? That's

1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:02.960
 a very important answer you gave. And I think if I just unpacked it, you'd see the truisms

1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:10.640
 that you've just exposed for us. But let me, sorry, I'm mindful that I didn't answer your

1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:14.560
 question before. What's the free energy principle good for? Is it just a pretty

1:16:14.560 --> 1:16:19.840
 theoretical exercise to explain nonequilibrium in steady states? Yes, it is. It does nothing

1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:25.200
 more for you than that. It can be regarded, it's going to sound very arrogant, but it is of the

1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:31.600
 sort of theory of natural selection or a hypothesis of natural selection.

1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:40.560
 Beautiful, undeniably true, but tells you absolutely nothing about why you have legs

1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:46.000
 and eyes. It tells you nothing about the actual phenotype and it wouldn't allow you to build

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:53.440
 something. So the free energy principle by itself is as vacuous as most

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:57.760
 tautological theories. And by tautological, of course, I'm talking to the theory of

1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:02.880
 natural survival of the fittest. What's the fittest survival? Why are the cycles the fitter?

1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:09.040
 It discorrected circles. In a sense, the free energy principle has that same deflationary

1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:18.480
 tautology under the hood. It's a characteristic of things that exist. Why do they exist? Because

1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:22.240
 they minimise their free energy. Why do they minimise their free energy? Because they exist.

1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:28.480
 And you just keep on going round and round and round. But the practical thing which you

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:36.320
 don't get from natural selection, but you could say has now manifest in things like differential

1:17:36.320 --> 1:17:41.760
 evolution or genetic algorithms and MCMC, for example, in machine learning. The practical

1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:49.200
 thing you can get is if it looks as if things that exist are trying to have density dynamics

1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:54.480
 and look as though they're optimising a variational free energy. And a variational free energy has

1:17:54.480 --> 1:18:00.560
 to be a functional of a generative model, probabilistic description of causes and

1:18:00.560 --> 1:18:05.520
 consequences, causes out there, consequences in the sensorium on the sensory parts of the

1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:10.320
 Markov Planckin. Then it should, in theory, impossible to write down the generative model,

1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:16.400
 work out the gradients, and then cause it to autonomously self evidence. So you should be

1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:21.760
 able to write down oil droplets. You should be able to create artefacts where you have supplied

1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:28.560
 the objective function that supplies the gradients that supplies the self organising dynamics to

1:18:28.560 --> 1:18:34.080
 non equilibrium steady state. So there is actually a practical application, the free energy principle,

1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:40.400
 when you can write down your required evidence in terms of, well, when you can write down the

1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:46.640
 generative model, that is the thing that has the evidence, the probability of these sensory data

1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:54.240
 or this data, given that given that model is effectively the thing that the elbow of the

1:18:54.240 --> 1:19:00.160
 variational free energy bounds or approximates. That means that you can actually write down the

1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:06.880
 model. And the kind of thing that you want to engineer the kind of AGI artificial general

1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:19.680
 intelligence that you want to manifest probabilistically. And then you engineer a robot and a computer

1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:26.000
 to perform a gradient descent on that objective function. So it does have a practical implication.

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:31.920
 Now, why am I wittering on about that? It did seem relevant to, yes. So what kinds of, so the

1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:37.040
 answer to, would it be easy or would it be hard? Well, mathematically, it's easy. I've just told

1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:45.280
 you all you need to do is write down your perfect artefact probabilistically in the form of a

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:49.760
 probabilistic generative model, a probability distribution over the causes and consequences

1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:57.920
 of the world in which this thing is immersed. And then you just engineer a computer and a robot

1:19:57.920 --> 1:20:03.680
 to form a gradient descent on that objective function. No problem. But of course, the big

1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:07.920
 problem is writing down the generative model. So that's where the heavy lifting comes in.

1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:14.080
 So it's the form and the structure of that generative model, which basically defines the

1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:19.520
 artefact that you will create or indeed the kind of artefact that has self awareness.

1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:24.640
 So that's where all the hard work comes in very much like natural selection doesn't tell you in

1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:29.840
 the slightest why you have eyes. So you have to drill down on the actual phenotype, the actual

1:20:29.840 --> 1:20:38.960
 generative model. So with that in mind, what did you tell me that tells me immediately the kinds

1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:44.240
 of generative models I would have to write down in order to have self awareness? What you said to me

1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:52.160
 was I have to have a model that is effectively fit for purpose for this kind of world in which I

1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:59.040
 operate. And if I now make the observation that this kind of world is effectively largely populated

1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:07.200
 by other things like me, i.e. you, then it makes enormous sense that if I can develop a hypothesis

1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:15.280
 that we are similar kinds of creatures, in fact, the same kind of creature, but I am me and you

1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:22.720
 are you, then it becomes again mandated to have a sense of self. So if I live in a world

1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:28.400
 that is constituted by things like me, basically a social world or community,

1:21:29.440 --> 1:21:34.560
 then it becomes necessary now for me to infer that it's me talking and not you talking. I wouldn't

1:21:34.560 --> 1:21:40.320
 need that if it was on Mars by myself or if I was in the jungle as a feral child. If there was

1:21:40.320 --> 1:21:48.080
 nothing like me around, there would be no need to have an inference that a hypothesis, oh yes,

1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:52.960
 it is me that is experiencing or causing these sounds and it is not you. It's only when there's

1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:59.840
 ambiguity in play induced by the fact that there are others in that world. So I think that the

1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:07.520
 special thing about self aware artifacts is that they have learned to or they have acquired,

1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:14.160
 or at least not equipped with, possibly by evolution, generative models that allow for the

1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:18.720
 fat. There are lots of copies of things like them around and therefore they have to work out it's

1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:25.520
 you and not me. That's brilliant. I've never thought of that. I never thought of that,

1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:33.600
 that the purpose of the really usefulness of consciousness or self awareness in the context

1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:39.440
 of planning existing in the world is so you can operate with other things like you. It doesn't

1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:44.080
 have to necessarily be human, it could be other kind of similar creatures. Absolutely. Well,

1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:49.760
 we view a lot of our attributes into our pets, don't we? Or we try to make our robots humanoid.

1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:54.560
 And I think there's a deep reason for that, that it's just much easier to read the world

1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:58.640
 if you can make the simplifying assumption that basically you're me and it's just your turn to

1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:05.440
 talk. I mean, when we talk about planning, when you talk specifically about planning, the highest

1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:10.080
 if like manifestation or realization of that planning is what we're doing now. I mean,

1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:16.000
 the human condition doesn't get any higher than this talking about the philosophy of existence

1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:24.480
 and the conversation. But in that conversation, there is a beautiful art of turn taking

1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:29.440
 and mutual inference, theory of mind. I have to know when you want to listen,

1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:32.320
 I have to know when you want to interrupt, I have to make sure that you're online,

1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:36.960
 I have to have a model in my head of your model in your head. That's the highest,

1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:40.640
 the most sophisticated form of generative model, where the generative model actually has a

1:23:40.640 --> 1:23:45.040
 generative model, somebody else's generative model. And I think that and what we are doing now

1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:52.240
 evinces the kinds of generative models that would support self awareness. Because without that,

1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:59.760
 we'd both be talking over each other, or we'd be singing together in a choir. That's not a

1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:04.800
 brilliant analogy for what I'm trying to say, but we wouldn't have this discourse.

1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:11.760
 Yeah, the dance of it. Yeah, that's right. You get to have as I interrupt. I mean, that's

1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:17.920
 beautifully put. I'll re listen to this conversation many times. There's so much

1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:25.520
 poetry in this and mathematics. Let me ask the silliest or perhaps the biggest question

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:34.480
 as a last kind of question. We've talked about living in existence and the objective function

1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:40.800
 under which these objects would operate. What do you think is the objective function of our

1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:48.720
 existence? What's the meaning of life? What do you think is the for you perhaps, the purpose, the

1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:56.880
 source of fulfillment, the source of meaning for your existence as one blob in the soup?

1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:04.480
 I'm tempted to answer that again as a physicist. Free energy, I expect consequent upon my behavior.

1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:09.520
 So technically, we can get a really interesting conversation about

1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:14.720
 what that comprises in terms of searching for information, resolving uncertainty about the

1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:20.880
 kind of thing that I am. But I suspect that you want a slightly more personal and fun answer.

1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:30.800
 But which is can be consistent with that. And I think it's reassuringly simple and

1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:39.040
 harps back to what you were taught as a child, that you have certain beliefs about the kind of

1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:45.680
 creature and the kind of person you are. And all that self evidencing means, all that minimizing

1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:52.640
 variational free energy in an inactive and embodied way means is fulfilling the beliefs

1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:58.960
 about what kind of thing you are. And of course, we're all given those scripts, those narratives

1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:06.080
 very early age, usually in the former bedtime stories or fairy stories that I'm a princess

1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:11.760
 and I'm going to make a beast who's going to transform. The narratives are all around you

1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:19.440
 from your parents to the friends, to the society feeds these stories. And then your objective

1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:26.080
 function is to fulfill. Exactly. That narrative that has been encultured by your immediate family,

1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:30.720
 but as you say also, the sort of the culture in which you grew up. And you create for yourself.

1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:36.960
 I mean, again, because of this active inference, this inactive aspect of self evidencing, you know,

1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:43.920
 not only am I modeling my environment, my economy, my my external states out there,

1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:48.800
 but I'm actively changing them all the time. And external states are doing the same back,

1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:54.720
 we're doing it together. So there's a synchrony that means that I'm creating my own culture

1:26:54.720 --> 1:27:01.600
 over different timescales. So the question now is for me being very selfish, what scripts were I

1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:08.480
 given? It basically was a mixture between Einstein and shark homes. So I smoke as heavily as possible,

1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:20.320
 try to avoid too much interpersonal contact. Yeah, enjoy the fantasy that you're a popular

1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:25.040
 scientist who's going to make a difference in a slightly quirky way. So that's what I grew up on.

1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:32.640
 My father was an engineer and loved science and he loved, you know, sort of things like Sir Arthur

1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:39.840
 Edwards, Space, Time and Gravitation, which was the first understandable version of general

1:27:39.840 --> 1:27:46.720
 relativity. And so all the fairy stories I was told as I was growing up were all about these

1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:53.280
 characters. I'm keeping the hobbit out of this because that was quite fit my narrative. There's

1:27:53.280 --> 1:28:00.640
 a journey of exploration, I suppose, of sorts. So yeah, I've just grown up to be what I imagine

1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:07.760
 a mild mannered Sherlock Holmes slash Albert Einstein would would do in my shoes.

1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:12.240
 And you did it elegantly and beautifully. Carl was a huge honor talking today. It was fun.

1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:17.120
