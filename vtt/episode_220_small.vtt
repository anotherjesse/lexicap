00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
 The following is a conversation with Nils Jorgensen, a New York firefighter for over 21 years who was

00:06.880 --> 00:14.320
 there at Ground Zero on September 11, 2001. He was forced to retire because of the leukemia he

00:14.320 --> 00:21.440
 contracted from cleaning up Ground Zero. This podcast tells his story and the story of other

00:21.440 --> 00:26.880
 great men and women who were there that day. Some of the stories we talk about are part of a new

00:26.880 --> 00:35.440
 limited podcast series that Nils hosts called 20 for 20 with 20 episodes for the 20 years since 9

00:35.440 --> 00:42.400
 11. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. As a side note,

00:42.400 --> 00:49.520
 please allow me to say a few words about the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. I was

00:49.520 --> 00:54.800
 in downtown Chicago on that day, lost in the mundane busyness of an early Tuesday morning.

00:54.800 --> 01:02.720
 At that time, I was already fascinated by human nature, the best and the worst of it, exploring it

01:02.720 --> 01:08.480
 through the study of history and literature. In the years before, as a young boy growing up in

01:08.480 --> 01:15.600
 Russia, I saw chaos, uncertainty and desperation in the Soviet Union of the 1990s, wrapping up a

01:15.600 --> 01:21.600
 century of war and suffering. But after coming to America for me, there was a sense of hope,

01:21.600 --> 01:28.560
 like all of it was behind us, a bad dream to be forgotten as we enter into the new century.

01:29.760 --> 01:34.400
 On 9 11, when I saw the news of the second plane hitting the towers,

01:34.400 --> 01:41.760
 my sense of hope had changed. I understood that the 21st century, like the century before, would

01:41.760 --> 01:50.000
 too have its tragedies, its evil doers, its wars and its suffering. And unlike the history books,

01:50.000 --> 01:57.280
 these stories will involve all of us. They will involve me, in however small and insignificant

01:57.280 --> 02:04.800
 a role, but one that nevertheless carries the responsibility to help. I became an American

02:04.800 --> 02:11.840
 that day, a citizen of the world. I felt the common humanity in all of us. I felt the unity

02:11.840 --> 02:16.480
 and the love and the days that followed. And I think most of the world shared in this feeling

02:16.480 --> 02:23.360
 that we are all in this together. Evil cannot defeat the human spirit. There were many heroes

02:23.360 --> 02:30.400
 sung and unsung on that day and in the years after. Often politicians fail to rightfully honor

02:30.400 --> 02:36.560
 the service and sacrifice of these heroes. There is much I could say about that. But I don't want

02:36.560 --> 02:43.200
 to waste my words on the failures of weak leaders. Instead, I want to say thank you to the men and

02:43.200 --> 02:49.040
 women who rushed to ground zero to help, who put on a uniform to serve, who make me proud to be an

02:49.040 --> 02:56.320
 American and a human being and give me hope about the future of our civilization here on a small

02:56.320 --> 03:04.000
 spinning rock that despite the long odds keeps kindling the fire of human consciousness and love.

03:05.280 --> 03:10.880
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Niels Jorgensen.

03:10.880 --> 03:17.680
 Take me through the day of September 11th, 2001. As you experienced it, as you lived it.

03:20.080 --> 03:26.640
 September 11th, 2001. It was a bright, beautiful, sunny Tuesday morning. It was a late summer.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.800
 There's a lot of folks who go to the beaches in New Jersey called the short summer. Everybody's left

03:32.800 --> 03:39.360
 there for Labor Day, but it's still beautiful enough to enjoy the weather. I left my house about

03:39.360 --> 03:47.600
 6.30 in the morning and my four and a half year old daughter said to me, daddy, which truck are you

03:47.600 --> 03:54.080
 driving today? The fire truck, the oil truck, or the Boer's head truck? Because I had three jobs

03:54.080 --> 04:01.120
 at the time. Most New York City firefighters and police officers, EMS, we don't make the most

04:01.120 --> 04:06.480
 amount of money. So in order to live in that city, you have to hustle. And my wife stayed at home

04:06.480 --> 04:12.560
 raising the children. So my daughter said, oh, she used to be safe because you're on the oil

04:12.560 --> 04:17.280
 truck. I told her I was going on an oil truck that day. So she says you should be safe today,

04:17.280 --> 04:22.240
 daddy. So I left and worked for this great company on the North Shore, Staten Island,

04:22.240 --> 04:28.160
 Quinlan Fuel. Very nice people. It treated me very well. And it was my first day back, actually,

04:28.160 --> 04:33.200
 for the winter season. I usually get laid off a couple of months in the summer because things,

04:33.200 --> 04:39.040
 you know, too hot to need oil. So I took the truck, started my route that day and

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
 clean hit the tower. So initially, I'm like, oh, it's probably some silly Learjet pilot.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.120
 And he veered off track to get a better picture for a client. And he hit the building, probably hit a,

04:52.320 --> 04:57.200
 you know, bad turbulence, gust of wind. It's very windy down in that area of Manhattan.

04:57.200 --> 05:03.280
 So that was my first thought. Can we pause there for a second? So 6.30 a.m., you wake up,

05:03.280 --> 05:10.800
 you leave, and then the plane hits at 8.45, 8.50. 8.45 a.m. Just interesting how you

05:10.800 --> 05:18.080
 phrase it. So how did you hear that a plane hit something? I'm a big news radio guy,

05:18.800 --> 05:23.360
 news guy, a bit of a buff. I've been that way since I was a kid. And I had the news radio on

05:23.360 --> 05:31.120
 the local New York radio station. And as I was driving the truck, I heard, you know,

05:31.120 --> 05:36.400
 a emergency report. This just in aircraft is just struck the World Trade Center.

05:37.200 --> 05:42.800
 And where Quinlands is located, it's on the north rim of Staten Island, which is right on New York

05:42.800 --> 05:48.880
 Harbor. And you could see Statue of Liberty, you know, a mile or two away in your distance,

05:48.880 --> 05:54.560
 and then past that is the towers. So I just literally stopped the truck and looked out,

05:54.560 --> 05:59.280
 and I saw the smoke. So there was smoke. Oh, it was dark, black smoke. It was just, yeah,

05:59.280 --> 06:05.680
 I mean, it was burning fully at that point. And did you have fear of what the hell happened?

06:06.800 --> 06:13.120
 I was initially scared for anybody involved. I realized, I said, there's gonna be lots of

06:13.120 --> 06:19.440
 fatalities, obviously, depending on the size of the aircraft. And, you know, the business day

06:19.440 --> 06:24.240
 there had started probably at 8830. So those buildings should have been packed at that moment.

06:24.240 --> 06:31.040
 So that was a thought across my mind. But from our being responder perspective,

06:31.040 --> 06:37.360
 if you're off duty, normally you do not go to a scene. They don't want you to because of

06:37.360 --> 06:44.640
 accountability and safety. The on duty platoon will handle it. And if it's something very horrific,

06:44.640 --> 06:50.240
 then they will have something called a recall, which is any police firefighter or EMS personnel is

06:50.240 --> 06:57.520
 obligated to go to their command immediately, check in with, you know, their command to get

06:57.520 --> 07:04.720
 their gear and standby and await orders for deployment, or to remain in that command for

07:04.720 --> 07:09.360
 your routine duties. How often throughout history have there been recalls?

07:09.360 --> 07:17.040
 I believe the one prior to that was like in the 1968 riots, possibly, and then maybe in the 70s,

07:17.040 --> 07:22.400
 there was another blackout in riots. And I remember my dad talking about it. And he actually always said,

07:23.120 --> 07:29.760
 just remember, if something bad's going down, don't just rush in, you will wait the recall.

07:29.760 --> 07:36.160
 Or at the very least, if there isn't a recall, you get to your firehouse. And because if you show up

07:36.160 --> 07:42.640
 somewhere, there's a good chance that no one knows you're there. And now you, in your well intended

07:44.320 --> 07:49.840
 movements, you get lost or trapped or no one's looking for you. So that's the whole thing with,

07:49.840 --> 07:55.200
 you know, checking in. And now you're with a squad or, you know, a group of guys and

07:55.200 --> 08:00.320
 everyone knows, you know, hey, there's nails, there's Lex, okay, they're on, you know, this team.

08:01.920 --> 08:07.280
 So I said, all right, they're not going to need us. It's probably going to be a fifth alarm. And,

08:07.280 --> 08:12.480
 you know, there'll be 250 firefighters there to handle it. It's going to be a bad day for those

08:12.480 --> 08:19.600
 guys. But, you know, our guys take on some heavy stuff and they'll be fine. A few minutes later,

08:19.600 --> 08:26.400
 the second plane hit and I knew immediately, I'm like, okay, we're under attack. So I just flew

08:26.400 --> 08:32.960
 the truck back in. I told my boss, I have to go. He understood. He knew something was way wrong.

08:32.960 --> 08:39.760
 And I just was flying. At the time, I actually had a yellow Volkswagen Beetle, kind of a goofy car

08:39.760 --> 08:43.760
 to be driving, but I loved it. So for people who are just listening, you're kind of a big guy.

08:43.760 --> 08:48.320
 Well, yeah, I could, I definitely need to lose about 50 pounds. No, I don't mean in that way,

08:48.320 --> 08:52.720
 your frame, big hands. As my beloved friend, Bobby Adams would say to me,

08:53.920 --> 08:58.960
 I was driving around in a clown wagon and he also says I have a waving, waving hairdo, waving bye

08:58.960 --> 09:04.800
 bye. So thanks, Bobby. Good luck. But yeah, he's a great friend. Yeah, so I took the Volkswagen

09:04.800 --> 09:09.600
 and I flew in and I was heading over to the Verrazano Bridge and hit the Brooklyn Queens Expressway.

09:11.600 --> 09:17.120
 And my phone rang and my wife normally doesn't curse or raise a voice and she was yelling at me

09:17.120 --> 09:21.600
 and she said, don't go in there, go to your firehouse. Well, first she asked, well, she knew

09:21.600 --> 09:27.200
 I was on the way, but she just wanted to know where. And I said, I'm on, I'm on the curve,

09:27.200 --> 09:32.080
 which is 65th Street on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway called Dead Man's Curve. We, we

09:32.080 --> 09:38.000
 actually used to do a lot of car wrecks up there. And I was hitting that curve pretty fast. And then

09:38.000 --> 09:42.320
 right around the curve is the exit to the firehouse. And I had to decide, well, am I driving

09:42.320 --> 09:47.920
 right in to the battery tunnel to the city? Or am I going to the firehouse? And then I said,

09:47.920 --> 09:54.320
 but I have no gear. I, I'm going to be ineffective. How do I show up with no gear, no protection,

09:54.320 --> 10:00.560
 no, you know, so she said, do what your dad would follow the recall, go to the firehouse.

10:00.560 --> 10:05.440
 And I said, hung up the phones. I love you. Gotta go. And I did. I went to the firehouse

10:05.440 --> 10:11.440
 and I'm glad to listen to her. I had my father ringing in my ears. My dad, beautiful guy,

10:11.440 --> 10:18.880
 he's 82, 34 years in New York City Fire Department. He, he came down and end stage

10:18.880 --> 10:31.680
 on Hudson's Lymphoma. He's 38 back in going on 39 1978. And this guy, he, he's my hero. He,

10:33.520 --> 10:37.120
 he was going to die. They sent him home. They said, you, there's really not much we can do.

10:37.120 --> 10:44.240
 Go get your affairs. And he says, the doc, I have three young kids and, and she called him

10:44.240 --> 10:50.640
 a couple hours later. She said, I got in touch with Sloan Kettering and they have a new, new drug.

10:50.640 --> 10:57.440
 We want you to be a test pilot. And he said, hey doc, I'm a, he's got a heavy Brooklyn accent.

10:57.440 --> 11:04.720
 I'm a fireman. I'm a fireman. I'm not a pilot. And so she said, no, no, we want you to try this

11:04.720 --> 11:09.600
 drug out. And it's, it's, if it works, we may have some success. But if not, he says, yeah,

11:09.600 --> 11:18.800
 I'm going to die. So let's do it. So every, every two weeks for four years, he, he'd go for treatment.

11:18.800 --> 11:25.360
 But he was assigned to a desk job after that, after the, the cancer tumor removal and, you know,

11:25.360 --> 11:30.080
 the heavy treatments. And he'd get up every morning, four o clock in the morning, and he'd,

11:30.080 --> 11:37.040
 he'd walk down to the train station in Staten Island, take the train. And then he'd take the ferry,

11:37.040 --> 11:42.000
 of course, to Harbor, and he'd get off looking at the towers. And then he'd take a subway into

11:42.000 --> 11:48.800
 Brooklyn. And on every other Thursday, he'd leave at noon and do the same exact reverse route. And

11:48.800 --> 11:56.880
 he'd get to the cancer center. And my mom would meet him and he'd get his infusion. And within two

11:56.880 --> 12:04.560
 hours, he'd be violently ill for a few days, really badly ill. And I just remember, you know,

12:04.560 --> 12:10.160
 he's 10 years, I was 10 years old. And he just had to have the room darkened out. And he,

12:10.160 --> 12:15.280
 he'd be so sick. And I just go in and wipe the vomit from his face, just try to give him a

12:15.280 --> 12:23.120
 little water, but he couldn't take it down because he'd throw it up. And maybe on Saturday,

12:23.120 --> 12:28.320
 he'd start coming around a little bit, drink down a little bit of tea. And on Sunday morning,

12:28.320 --> 12:34.800
 he put his robe on and he'd go down. Mom would make him black coffee and toast. He'd sit up,

12:35.440 --> 12:39.760
 watch the news, watch the game. And then Monday morning, he'd go back to work. He did that for

12:39.760 --> 12:48.400
 four years. And he's 82. And he's still here. You said that your dad's a man of a few words,

12:48.400 --> 12:54.400
 but when he talks, they're profound. So what, what words were ringing in your ear when you were

12:54.400 --> 12:59.920
 driving? I just always remember him saying, kid, they give the recall, you go to the firehouse.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.960
 You don't go where you think you should. You go to the firehouse, you follow your orders.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.760
 So do the smart thing, do your job. Yes, sir. And every time we hang up the phone,

13:09.760 --> 13:15.600
 it's fireman talk. He'd say, I love you, keep low. My dad couldn't tell me he loved me until

13:15.600 --> 13:22.640
 I told him when I first got on a fire department, I was 22. And my dad grew up in a tough household.

13:22.640 --> 13:28.720
 My granddad was a good man, but a tormented man. He, he was sent away from home at 12 years old.

13:30.240 --> 13:36.480
 He was from Denmark and I'm named after him, grandpa Nels. And I think his demons

13:37.440 --> 13:43.440
 took up a large part of his life, his anger, his, whatever it was, his fear. We got the sense that

13:43.440 --> 13:49.840
 maybe when he was a child, he was an apprentice baker living with strangers working for them.

13:49.840 --> 13:54.640
 And we, we think maybe he was abused and that's why he took it out on my, my dad and my grandma,

13:54.640 --> 14:02.640
 my aunts, but they, they made it up to each other at the end of my granddad's life. My granddad turned

14:02.640 --> 14:08.000
 out to be the best grandfather ever. He, I think he tried to heal and heal everyone by his change

14:08.000 --> 14:14.640
 of behavior. So he's proof that you can change, you can improve if you work on it. But I know

14:14.640 --> 14:19.440
 I'm going off track here, but, but you're a man enough in your, you say in your 20s to tell your

14:19.440 --> 14:27.360
 dad, yeah, I got on a job. He said, I had a go kid. I was the tour, we called tour duty.

14:27.360 --> 14:32.480
 I said, oh, that was great. It was great. I love it. And he goes, we just remember you keep low,

14:32.480 --> 14:38.720
 you always keep low and keep low means you stay down below the flames, you know, for room flashes

14:38.720 --> 14:42.720
 over and it's, it's burning you. If you stay up high, you're going to get burned badly. But if

14:42.720 --> 14:49.200
 you get down on your belly and you crawl, you'll get out. So he'd always say that when you hang

14:49.200 --> 14:54.800
 up the phone. And I said, well, I love you pop. And he says, oh, well, thanks kid. I said, well,

14:54.800 --> 15:00.560
 you can say it too. And, uh, Oh, nice. He pressured and he did and he said it. And now every time we

15:00.560 --> 15:06.240
 talk, he says it. So, you know, um, you know, they talk about masculinity and whatnot. And

15:06.240 --> 15:11.920
 my dad is one of those tough, tough guys with a soft edge. And that's, that's how he brought me up.

15:13.440 --> 15:18.800
 You know, to be a protector. I hate bullies. I was bullied really badly as a kid. And

15:20.000 --> 15:25.600
 I really hated it. And, and now I find myself sometimes throwing myself into situations to

15:25.600 --> 15:32.640
 protect people that are being, you know, violated and hurt. And, uh, I just can't walk away from it.

15:32.640 --> 15:37.360
 But that's my dad. My dad, uh, was that, you know, just a great guy. But anyway, yeah.

15:37.360 --> 15:41.280
 You still listen to, therefore see you, you probably want to rush right to the,

15:42.240 --> 15:46.560
 to the towers, but you went. Yeah. So anyway, I got, I did, I listened to him. I listened to

15:46.560 --> 15:50.080
 my wife and went to the firehouse. And it was really strange. It was eerie because, um,

15:50.080 --> 15:56.560
 um, the computer dispatch system was, was still beeping, um, which meant it, it sent the dispatch

15:56.560 --> 16:01.920
 and the truck received it. Later on, 14, my, my truck company received it and they left,

16:01.920 --> 16:07.920
 they were gone. So there was this beautiful old building built in the 1880s with a spiral staircase,

16:08.560 --> 16:14.640
 just a narrow old brick garage and it was empty. And I just heard the computer chirping

16:14.640 --> 16:20.160
 and I looked down on a ticket and I said, a lot of 114 respond, the Vessie and West World Trade

16:20.160 --> 16:26.000
 Center aircraft into building. And I said, Oh God, I just hope they're not on a death ride

16:26.000 --> 16:32.880
 because this, this now was two towers and, uh, they were burning. They were free burning. And,

16:32.880 --> 16:38.480
 and I knew this was really, really bad. And, uh, I got on the phone and I called commands right

16:38.480 --> 16:42.800
 away. I called the 40th battalion and I, you know, chief's chief's aide just said, look,

16:42.800 --> 16:47.680
 you know, get 12 guys, sign them in to the journal. There's a journal of daily events,

16:47.680 --> 16:51.680
 every, everything that takes place in the firehouse 24 seven has to be logged.

16:53.360 --> 16:59.040
 And I logged myself as coming in, reporting for, reporting for duty. Um, and as the guys came in,

16:59.040 --> 17:05.120
 I logged them in and then, uh, one of our lieutenants took command. We grabbed up a bunch of gear

17:05.120 --> 17:11.840
 and they basically told us get 12 guys, get a city bus and get down to the battery,

17:11.840 --> 17:15.920
 the battery tunnel. They, they said it would probably be closed. There was threats. It was

17:15.920 --> 17:24.320
 going to be blown up to get to the Brooklyn bridge. And, uh, so we did, we got a city bus. We flagged

17:24.320 --> 17:28.880
 it down and the bus driver said, I'm sorry, I can't give you the bus. I will drive you. And he took

17:28.880 --> 17:35.440
 us and we stopped an engine 201, which is just about a quarter mile down the road from us. Uh,

17:35.440 --> 17:42.320
 that's our affiliated engine company and my, uh, my, my childhood best friend here, Johnny,

17:42.320 --> 17:49.040
 shard was, he was assigned there and he was on shift and, uh, then they went through the tunnel

17:51.200 --> 17:56.480
 and, uh, we picked up those guys, the off duty guys from 201. And then we kept going down

17:56.480 --> 18:02.160
 Fort Davion. We picked up two 39s crew and then we hightailed it down the bridge and, um,

18:02.160 --> 18:08.000
 there's a lot of traffic. There's a lot of people fleeing coming over the bridge and waves. So it

18:08.000 --> 18:16.480
 affected, uh, the inbound. What was the mood like? Um, it was somber because just prior to get on the

18:16.480 --> 18:24.800
 bus, the, uh, first tower went down. So we, we, we figured that I heard 114, uh, my lieutenant,

18:24.800 --> 18:33.280
 Dennis Oberg, I heard him on the radio and he, uh, he said 114 Manhattan, we're on your frequency.

18:33.280 --> 18:38.240
 What's, you know, what do you need us? And they said, uh, Tally Ho, which is our nickname,

18:38.240 --> 18:43.200
 Tally Ho responding to Vessie and West to the command post and, uh, receive your orders.

18:44.000 --> 18:52.880
 And I heard Dennis Tally Ho 10 four and, uh, Dennis, a little while after that, they were

18:52.880 --> 18:59.040
 proceeding to go into, I believe it was, I get this mixed up and I'm sorry, I should know this

18:59.040 --> 19:05.280
 right at the back of my hand, but sometimes it's just such a haze, but the second tower hit was

19:05.280 --> 19:10.240
 the first one to go down and, um, they were heading over to go in it. And all of a sudden he looked

19:10.240 --> 19:14.880
 up and he saw like what he thought to be disintegration and he turned the guys around. He said, run,

19:14.880 --> 19:21.040
 just run, don't look back, don't look up, go. They sprinted as fast as they could and, uh,

19:21.040 --> 19:26.400
 they dove under a fire truck and the guys that were sprinting behind them 40 feet away were

19:27.680 --> 19:33.280
 underneath the pile. That was 10 stories deep. They, they were killed and just further into

19:33.280 --> 19:39.200
 that pile was his rookie son who Dennis's rookie son who was working in ladder 105,

19:39.200 --> 19:44.480
 which was my first command on the department. I worked for proudly serve for three years

19:44.480 --> 19:53.520
 and just to side them was my childhood best friend, John Chard and his, uh, his crew from 201 and, uh,

19:55.920 --> 20:05.280
 they, they were all killed. And the strange irony to, um, to that is that Dennis, Dennis's son Dennis

20:05.280 --> 20:11.360
 Jr. was working underneath the, uh, under the wing of a senior man, as we say, a senior man,

20:11.360 --> 20:17.120
 is a guy with a lot of experience and he'll, uh, watch over you, make sure you don't, you don't

20:17.120 --> 20:22.080
 veer off. Like I veer off a lot of talking and, uh, you don't veer off and you get yourself hurt.

20:23.760 --> 20:28.240
 In the morning of 1993 bombing, Henry Miller was my senior man.

20:28.240 --> 20:42.240
 And I was the young guy under his wing and he protected me and toward the end of the day,

20:42.240 --> 20:49.200
 looked around and he said, kid, it's a bad day. He said, they didn't do it right. They blew it

20:49.200 --> 20:55.040
 up in the middle. If they did it in a corner, they would have dropped this building half

20:55.040 --> 20:59.920
 mile down the canal street, but don't kid yourself. They'll be back and they'll do it and they'll do

20:59.920 --> 21:06.960
 it right next time. And it's so strange and so prophetic because he was there with him. He died

21:06.960 --> 21:13.200
 with Dennis. He knew it. And like 1994, we had a training manual with a picture of the towers

21:13.200 --> 21:20.000
 with a target. And this is not, not a matter of if, but a matter of when be prepared.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.920
 And one thing it was like people knew, right? And we didn't stop it. And, uh,

21:30.240 --> 21:34.560
 so we got off the bus, but just prior to that coming over, the bridge of the second tower was

21:34.560 --> 21:39.760
 gone now. And we're just destroyed because we're like, oh, guys are there. They're all in there.

21:39.760 --> 21:45.840
 Now we've feeling like cowards because we got there late. And initially we're thinking there's

21:45.840 --> 21:50.640
 500 guys that are gone because there was a 10th, 10th alarm assignment, which means

21:52.880 --> 21:58.480
 50, 60 fire trucks, uh, five to six guys per, you know, you're looking at

21:59.920 --> 22:05.760
 at least there was even more 10th alarm plus multiple arms on top of it. It was a dispatch

22:05.760 --> 22:12.080
 basically equivalent of five to 600 firefighters who figured out they're all, they're all in there,

22:12.080 --> 22:18.400
 all gone. All the police officers, port authority police, NYPD police, court officers just up the

22:18.400 --> 22:24.960
 street from the courts, transit cops from the train tunnels. Like just, you know, we knew

22:24.960 --> 22:30.560
 everybody was going in there and, uh, now they're gone. So you, what you saw, what, what were we

22:30.560 --> 22:37.120
 looking at? What did it look like? So you saw rubble and then you knew that many, that 105

22:37.120 --> 22:43.360
 and 201, many of those guys are in the, they're dead. Yeah. And we thought 114 was in there too.

22:43.360 --> 22:47.360
 We didn't realize at that point, we didn't even realize that they had gotten under that truck.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.640
 We thought they were all gone, but yeah, it looked like, like it looked like,

22:51.600 --> 22:58.080
 it looked like a movie scene with just end of the earth destruction. It's just massive piles of

22:59.200 --> 23:05.200
 intertwined steel, what was left of the steel. And, and you know, there was no cement. It was

23:05.200 --> 23:14.080
 all just dust and it was just a burning pile of, of dust and concrete and plastic. And it was just,

23:14.080 --> 23:21.120
 everything was just pulverized and it was, it was truly hard to mentally compute that. Like it was

23:21.120 --> 23:27.360
 like what? And then there was just fighter jets, a couple of fighter jets just circling and, and

23:27.360 --> 23:33.200
 you just heard the flying by over your head. I mean, you literally see the guy banking a turn

23:33.200 --> 23:37.680
 around a Brooklyn bridge and just coming back and I'm like, Holy shoot, we're on their attack.

23:38.480 --> 23:44.320
 And we, we couldn't really get concrete intel as to what exactly we knew planes. But then we kept

23:44.320 --> 23:50.320
 hearing there was multiple devices. There was devices in a battery tunnel and there was devices

23:50.320 --> 23:55.120
 on a George Washington bridge and in the subways and it was just, it was just chaos. It was,

23:55.120 --> 23:58.880
 I mean, we kept it together obviously, because that's kind of, we try, that's what we do.

23:58.880 --> 24:06.400
 But the, the just constant barrage of different reports, it was like, Holy shoot. And then as

24:06.400 --> 24:11.120
 we were being deployed, it was a little frustrating, but they were trying to take command and send us

24:11.120 --> 24:16.800
 in groups now because they realized we have to start searching this. There's, you could hear the,

24:16.800 --> 24:21.440
 the alarms on the, on the Scott air mask, the, the packs we wear to go into the building.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.040
 It has emotional alarm. And if you stop moving for 30 seconds, it just sounds like this whining,

24:27.040 --> 24:34.320
 you know, this screaming bell, like it just keeps going and going. And you could hear multiple units

24:34.320 --> 24:39.520
 of those going off and you're like, wait a minute, there's guys with those, like, where are they?

24:40.080 --> 24:45.600
 And it's emanating from underneath the pile. And, you know, it was, it was just surreal and

24:47.280 --> 24:54.080
 truly like, like, like a war zone. You know, I mean, I was a soldier in the reserves and I never

24:54.080 --> 24:58.960
 saw a combat and I would never claim that I did. But, you know, we trained, we trained for a lot

24:58.960 --> 25:04.160
 of situations and we trained in, you know, real life atmospheres and whatnot. And this was just

25:04.160 --> 25:10.000
 beyond that by leaps and bounds. It was, it was bizarre. Did you see the towers collapse?

25:10.000 --> 25:14.640
 As we were coming over the bridge, I, the first one, we were, as we were deploying from the

25:14.640 --> 25:21.520
 firehouse, we had a television on and I started to go down and just, it was just like, and,

25:21.520 --> 25:25.680
 and, you know, we were so involved in getting gear together and getting, okay, you know,

25:25.680 --> 25:28.160
 teams set up and okay, you're going to be with these two guys. And these,

25:29.840 --> 25:34.320
 and I just yelled at the guys and they looked at me. I dropped to my knees and I started praying.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.840
 They're like, what, what the hell's wrong? I said, I couldn't even say, it's like,

25:38.880 --> 25:42.640
 14, they're in there. And they're like, what? I said, the tower's gone.

25:43.360 --> 25:49.120
 And all you saw on the TV was just this pile of dust and I guess because they didn't see it going

25:49.120 --> 25:56.160
 down, I probably thought I truly lost it. And then, then the realization came as like, wow,

25:56.160 --> 26:02.640
 the tower's down. So now it was like, wow, this is really on. So we just took off and got that boss.

26:04.800 --> 26:08.640
 So if you thought many of the guys on 114 were dead,

26:10.800 --> 26:17.040
 if you thought that, did you think you're going to die? I mean, if you're rushing into the, towards

26:17.040 --> 26:23.280
 the rubble, I, as crazy as it sounds, I never thought that the other tower would go down.

26:23.280 --> 26:28.480
 I said, okay, maybe some freak chance that one went down, but no, the other one's not going to

26:28.480 --> 26:32.720
 go. Like they're built so strong. You know, I was in those towers so many times and I mean,

26:32.720 --> 26:38.400
 I ate dinner up in the top four restaurant windows on the world and I'm saying, no, there's no way.

26:38.400 --> 26:45.040
 Like, like how the hell did this one happen? But I was having a hard time mentally processing

26:45.040 --> 26:51.440
 that the building was gone. And, and, and believe me, if, if you don't have fear in this industry

26:51.440 --> 26:56.880
 and, you know, police fire military, then you're, you're kidding yourself or you're a danger to

26:56.880 --> 27:01.760
 everyone. I don't care who it is as tough as they are to send that everybody has a certain level of

27:01.760 --> 27:07.600
 fear with doing this. And I don't care how long you do it. There's always that chance of something

27:07.600 --> 27:13.520
 going bad. And, and everyone who does it has that certain amount of fear. But at that point,

27:13.520 --> 27:19.440
 it was such a feeling of disbelief that fear wasn't even kicking in. It was just like, what the

27:19.440 --> 27:25.600
 hell just happened? And I honestly think it was almost like a shock and, and it just stayed that

27:25.600 --> 27:32.000
 whole day. So the building is before collapses is burning. It's just burning. I mean, upper floor

27:32.000 --> 27:37.920
 is just, you know, up in the 78th, up to the 80s. And then it's, you know, there's the way that the

27:37.920 --> 27:42.000
 cut was from the plane. It wasn't just straight across. It was, you know, from the 78th, then,

27:42.000 --> 27:49.040
 you know, on up to maybe the 86th. And, you know, then the jet fuel had come down and was burning

27:49.040 --> 27:55.920
 down. And there was people on the, on the ground who were doused with jet fuel that was already

27:55.920 --> 28:03.200
 burning and they were lit on fire on the ground. It was, it was just insane how vast the destruction

28:03.200 --> 28:09.120
 path was. As a firefighter, what are you supposed to do with that scale of fire?

28:09.120 --> 28:16.880
 I think the first bosses in the first chiefs, we're just going to do their best to get,

28:18.320 --> 28:25.200
 as we, we get hose lines with our whole theory is our tactics is to get water at the fire,

28:25.200 --> 28:30.640
 at the base of the fire, and get the truck company, which is the ladder company. They're the guys who

28:30.640 --> 28:36.480
 break the doors down, put ladders up this and that to get them to where the life is most expected

28:36.480 --> 28:41.600
 and get them out of there. So I think the chief's tactics at that point was, let me get multiple

28:41.600 --> 28:47.680
 engine companies. Let me get four, five, six hose lines fighting this fire, this massive fire.

28:47.680 --> 28:53.040
 And let me get 15, 20 truck companies up there, just yoking people out of there.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.520
 Yeah, but you got to go up the stair. Everything's not working.

28:55.520 --> 29:02.720
 Yeah. Guys had to walk up 80, 80, 90 hundred flights of stairs. And there's audio of, of

29:02.720 --> 29:09.120
 officers and firefighters speaking to each other on the radio channels. And unfortunately, at that

29:09.120 --> 29:14.160
 point in time, we had very, very bad communication system. We've been fighting for years to get

29:14.160 --> 29:19.840
 radios that work properly. We couldn't because it was a lot of money. We fought for years to get the

29:19.840 --> 29:25.200
 full bunker firefighting suits, which is the pants and the coat. We used to have just coats and these

29:25.200 --> 29:30.400
 roll up rubber boots and guys were burning to death. And we had to fight. And unfortunately,

29:30.400 --> 29:37.040
 we lost three guys and won vicious, vicious fire in 1994. And then they finally said,

29:37.040 --> 29:45.200
 enough's enough. Give these guys the gear. So it's a strange phenomenon in the first responder

29:45.200 --> 29:50.080
 world and in the military world. It's really one of the most important things that takes

29:50.080 --> 29:57.360
 place in society, the most pertinent organizations, and we can't get the funding we need. It's crazy.

29:57.360 --> 30:04.160
 They'll throw money at every nonsensical thing. But when it comes to gear, equipment, protective

30:04.160 --> 30:10.400
 equipment, trucks, this couldn't get it. Just all the ways you could take care of people. I saw

30:11.120 --> 30:18.880
 in since 9 11, the wars in the Middle East have cost America over $6 trillion. And the amount of

30:18.880 --> 30:26.160
 that money that was spent on the soldiers, in this case, the first responders is minimal compared

30:26.160 --> 30:34.960
 to it. Yeah. It was nothing. They closed down. I believe it's either seven or eight. In May of

30:35.760 --> 30:43.600
 2002, they closed down nine firehouses in New York City for budget reasons. We hadn't even finished

30:43.600 --> 30:50.000
 cleaning up the World Trade Center site and they slashed the budget. And still to this day,

30:50.640 --> 30:54.880
 have not reopened those firehouses. There's a million more people now living in New York City

30:54.880 --> 31:02.640
 than there were in 2001. And the fire protection is way less than it was. And it's a sin. It's

31:02.640 --> 31:12.640
 really a sin. Can I ask you a difficult question? So there's this famous photograph of a falling man.

31:13.280 --> 31:19.120
 So many people had to decide when they're above the fire or in the fire, whether to jump out of

31:19.120 --> 31:24.400
 the building or to burn to death. What do you make of that decision? What do you make of that

31:24.400 --> 31:32.560
 situation? Those people who jumped, those were acts of sheer desperation. I've been in fires

31:33.760 --> 31:39.760
 and just minor burns, but minor in situation. But I've been trapped or caught somewhat,

31:39.760 --> 31:45.760
 ended up in a burn center for nothing serious at all. But for those brief

31:46.720 --> 31:51.920
 seconds, half a minute, was, thank God, if I didn't have my fire gear on, I would have been burned

31:51.920 --> 32:00.640
 to very, very horrible level. Those people were burning alive. And they had the choice of either

32:00.640 --> 32:09.360
 to stay there and burn alive or to launch themselves. And some of them, I don't fault them,

32:09.360 --> 32:14.480
 but they had a few folks, they won't show it anymore because they say, I don't know why I

32:14.480 --> 32:20.080
 defend some people, but they had a couple of folks that took umbrellas and they took garbage bags

32:20.080 --> 32:25.120
 because they thought that it would slow down their acceleration rate to the ground and maybe,

32:25.120 --> 32:32.320
 just maybe they wouldn't be killed. And that's, to me, a true sense of desperation for humanity to

32:32.320 --> 32:39.200
 say, I'm going to die either way, but let me take my chance. And I don't know the exact number of

32:39.200 --> 32:44.880
 those folks who did that, but our first member of the fire department killed firefighter Daniel

32:44.880 --> 32:52.720
 Serf, aged 216, was struck by a jumper. And one of my dear friends was ordered to help

32:53.760 --> 33:00.400
 take him. And they knew he was passed away because he was hit by a flying missile. I mean,

33:00.400 --> 33:06.960
 120 miles an hour body lands on you. Those two bodies are now crushed. And they were ordered

33:06.960 --> 33:12.160
 to take that firefighter and bring him across the street to engine 10, ladder 10. It was literally

33:12.160 --> 33:19.840
 a firehouse, less than 100 yards from the facade of the trade center, from the trade center complex.

33:19.840 --> 33:25.200
 They literally right there. And there was plane parts that went into that firehouse,

33:25.200 --> 33:29.360
 landed into the front doors onto the roof, but the building itself was not destroyed.

33:30.080 --> 33:36.800
 So it was used as a mini command center for quite a while. So my friend was ordered to take Daniel's

33:36.800 --> 33:45.600
 body in respect and bring it over to this firehouse and give it some semblance of dignity and lay it

33:45.600 --> 33:51.680
 out on one of the bunk room, the bunks we have in the bunkhouse and just cover it with a sheet

33:51.680 --> 33:57.360
 and put a sign, please, firefighter killed, do not disturb. And then we'll get to him later,

33:57.360 --> 34:02.320
 because obviously this operation is going to go on for days. And my friend, who's such a great,

34:02.320 --> 34:08.880
 great, wonderful guy is so still to this day, filled with guilt because if they weren't taking his

34:08.880 --> 34:14.800
 body out with the respect and dignity that they did, it took a while because it's just,

34:14.800 --> 34:21.600
 it's a tough situation. His ladder company was coming over the bridge. There's a famous picture

34:22.400 --> 34:27.520
 of ladder 118. You see this tractor trailer fire truck. It's the one when the guy in the back also

34:27.520 --> 34:33.600
 drives. And it's a zoomed out shot. And you see the Brooklyn bridge and you see only the fire

34:33.600 --> 34:39.760
 truck in the middle. And you see the two burning towers in the distance. Well, his engine company

34:39.760 --> 34:45.120
 was just ahead of them on the bridge. And the only reason that engine company lived is their

34:45.120 --> 34:50.400
 initial duty assignment was to take that firefighter and bring his body over. It's like the military.

34:50.400 --> 34:55.520
 We don't leave anyone behind. These are our guys. As we some guys say, it's all about the guy right

34:55.520 --> 35:00.160
 next to you and nothing else really matters. When that guy right next to you goes down,

35:00.160 --> 35:06.640
 it stops. You get that guy to safety or if he's dead, you get him out. So in that timeframe,

35:08.240 --> 35:12.960
 that saved his life. But that's a heavy burden to carry now for the rest of your life. Because

35:12.960 --> 35:21.200
 you say, if I wasn't helping my dead friend, I'm dead. Yeah. What did it look like at ground zero?

35:21.200 --> 35:27.760
 What did it feel like? What did it smell like? You said there was a sense that it was almost

35:27.760 --> 35:34.560
 like a war zone. But can you paint the picture of how much dust is in the air? How hot is it?

35:35.120 --> 35:44.560
 How many people are there? And again, how did it feel like? It was just a scene of control chaos,

35:45.120 --> 35:49.760
 control because there was a semblance of command and we were just trying to do our jobs.

35:49.760 --> 35:56.160
 But it was such a frantic pace because we're now digging frantically, knowing that there's

35:56.160 --> 36:00.240
 life underneath this pile. And this is throughout the afternoon of that evening.

36:01.520 --> 36:09.120
 Yeah. I mean, this was nonstop, just nonstop really for days. But for my particular crew,

36:09.120 --> 36:14.400
 we literally kept going. We initially were dispatched over towards number seven, had just

36:14.400 --> 36:19.360
 gone down and we were searching the post office that was there. There was reports of people trapped.

36:20.320 --> 36:24.640
 And we painstakingly searched every single inch of that building to make sure no one was left in

36:24.640 --> 36:30.640
 there. And then we were deployed to the pile. And the pile is sort of ambiguous because there was

36:30.640 --> 36:38.640
 just such a vast, vast pile. I mean, it went for city blocks. And we were assisting in the retrieval

36:38.640 --> 36:45.040
 of two Port Authority police officers were lucky enough to survive, but they were trapped. They

36:45.040 --> 36:50.720
 were deep down into a crevasse and they had to be physically dug out and extricated. So there

36:50.720 --> 36:56.400
 was a couple of hundred, few hundred guys involved in that process of bringing in equipment, jaws

36:56.400 --> 37:02.240
 of life, airbags to lift steel, just to cut pieces of steel. It was just a huge operation.

37:02.240 --> 37:08.560
 And we were back toward the logistics end of it, shuttling in gear and bring it in stretchers,

37:08.560 --> 37:15.520
 bring it in oxygen, whatever was needed. And you were trying to climb over this jagged pile of

37:15.520 --> 37:20.080
 debris. It wasn't like you just walked a hundred feet on a street with something. You were trying

37:20.080 --> 37:24.880
 to climb over this I beam and then down into this hole and then back up that hole. I mean,

37:24.880 --> 37:32.400
 just to run one piece of equipment took a half an hour to get a hundred feet, 200 feet. Mind you,

37:32.400 --> 37:37.440
 some of these pieces of equipment are a hundred pounds, generator for a hearse tools, this massive

37:37.440 --> 37:45.120
 motor on a frame. Unstable ground. Unstable ground. Just horrible conditions. Fires were still burning

37:45.120 --> 37:51.840
 aside you beneath you. And at one point, I kind of veered off to the side and I was with this other

37:51.840 --> 37:59.840
 fireman from my father's old latter company, 172. And it was strange because we were down quite a

37:59.840 --> 38:05.760
 bit down, like 70 feet down into this ravine of debris. And he says, brother, what are you here?

38:06.720 --> 38:12.480
 And at the time it was like dust. It was like sand just falling down a pile. And it was hissing

38:12.480 --> 38:19.760
 from gas pipes and water pipes. And I said, I hear the gas lines. I hear the sand. I hear the

38:19.760 --> 38:25.760
 concrete. He goes, no, no, what else do you hear? And just the side of us was a lady's pocketbook

38:26.320 --> 38:35.280
 and a high heel shoe and someone's sneaker with nobody with it. And I said, I don't know. I don't

38:35.280 --> 38:41.920
 hear anything. He says, me neither. He goes, no one's coming out of here. And I said, no, no, no,

38:41.920 --> 38:45.600
 there's got to be someone coming out of here. I mean, there's thousands of people in here and

38:45.600 --> 38:52.800
 they're coming out. He says, brother, we would hear him calling for help. They're gone. And

38:53.600 --> 38:59.280
 I still at that point thought there was a chance. And after about the fourth day,

38:59.280 --> 39:04.160
 they just said, this is a recovery now. There's no more. There's no more life. There's no more

39:04.160 --> 39:10.560
 chance. And then that first night, we went full tilt till my crew, my specific crew of 12, 15

39:10.560 --> 39:15.920
 guys. And four in the morning, we just couldn't breathe anymore. We couldn't see. We were caked

39:15.920 --> 39:21.920
 just with, it was like if you took flour and just kept dousing yourself. And the lieutenant just said,

39:21.920 --> 39:25.840
 look guys, we're going to go back. We're going to get some medical aid. And then we'll come back

39:25.840 --> 39:35.120
 in a few hours. And we took a city bus back through the battery tunnel. And unbeknownst to us,

39:35.120 --> 39:41.280
 that morning, this off duty firefighter, Steven Siller from squad company one,

39:42.480 --> 39:48.480
 he, he raced down there with his pickup. And he couldn't go any further because the traffic was

39:48.480 --> 39:54.480
 stopped up because they had a report of a bomb. So everything was held up. And he grabbed his

39:54.480 --> 40:00.720
 fire gear and he put it on stuff weighs about 60 pounds. And he ran through the tunnel,

40:00.720 --> 40:07.280
 two and a half miles, got to the end of the tunnel. Fire truck was coming in from the other way.

40:08.000 --> 40:14.240
 He hopped on the back, got him up to West street, jumped off, tried to look for his company where

40:14.240 --> 40:22.000
 they were. And he was never seen again. He just ran through the tunnel, ran through the tunnel.

40:22.560 --> 40:27.680
 And he got there to help his team, right? It's all about the team. It's all about the guy right

40:27.680 --> 40:32.560
 next to you. And he's the tunnel to towers foundation, Steven, his, his brother Frank

40:32.560 --> 40:38.320
 decided in his name in perpetuity, he's got a fund that, that now builds a home

40:39.040 --> 40:45.360
 for every gold star family, for every seriously battle wounded warrior, for every seriously

40:45.360 --> 40:50.480
 wounded first responder or killed in a lighting duty first responder. If they had a home,

40:51.280 --> 40:54.880
 they paid a mortgage. If they didn't have a home, they give them a home.

40:54.880 --> 40:59.840
 And especially if it's, if it's a severely battle wounded, they give them a smart home

40:59.840 --> 41:06.720
 because these poor guys come home with no limbs. And so the beauty of, the beauty of Steven and

41:06.720 --> 41:13.280
 his selfless act was that he's now helped thousands and thousands of people in the tunnel to towers

41:13.280 --> 41:17.760
 is incredible. That's part of our, part of our mission is to bring awareness to these great

41:17.760 --> 41:22.240
 people at tunnel to towers, what they do, they've raised $250 million to help,

41:22.240 --> 41:29.920
 to help protect the protectors, to rescue the rescuers in, in a what's become unfortunately

41:29.920 --> 41:36.000
 a somewhat ungrateful society, but they will not forget these great guys.

41:37.040 --> 41:43.120
 So you tell Steven's story, he's one of the 20 people that you talk about in the new

41:43.760 --> 41:50.000
 iron labs 20 for 20 podcast series. If you can just linger on his story a little longer,

41:50.000 --> 41:57.920
 or what does that tell you about the human spirit that this guy, you know, the tunnel

41:57.920 --> 42:04.000
 couldn't, couldn't drive through. So he just puts on that heavy pack and runs. What do you make of that?

42:05.920 --> 42:11.280
 That shows the depth of a man's soul. He didn't have to do that. He could have turned around

42:11.280 --> 42:20.080
 and went home to his family and nobody would have shamed him. But he's one of those beautiful,

42:20.080 --> 42:28.080
 brave people that take a job. It really doesn't pay a lot of money. And you become a cop or a

42:28.080 --> 42:36.880
 firefighter or a nurse or an EMT or a medic or soldier or a Marine or airman sailor. When you

42:36.880 --> 42:43.920
 take these jobs, you don't do it for fanfare. You definitely don't do it for money. I mean,

42:43.920 --> 42:50.160
 those 13 brave souls we lost a week or two ago in Afghanistan, they're brand new soldiers and

42:50.160 --> 42:57.040
 Marines, they make $22,000 an hour, but they don't work 40 hours a week. They work 80,

42:57.040 --> 43:02.560
 they work 90 hours a week. So they make it about six bucks an hour. And you know what, they sign up

43:02.560 --> 43:10.320
 and firefighters and cops and medics and EMTs, nurses, emergency room doctors,

43:11.040 --> 43:14.640
 they don't really make a lot of money. I mean, they're starting salary right now for a New York

43:14.640 --> 43:22.000
 cop. I was a New York cop for two years first. I made $12.25 an hour back in 1989 to get shot at

43:22.960 --> 43:30.880
 during the crack wars. If you made $11 an hour with a family of four, you were entitled to

43:30.880 --> 43:39.200
 welfare back then. So I was just above the welfare level, risking my life. And these are the guys

43:39.200 --> 43:44.960
 that are getting ripped up now, right? And look, I won't get into any politics, but like,

43:46.400 --> 43:51.440
 that says something about a someone's soul that they're willing to take a job like that and get,

43:51.440 --> 43:57.520
 now get zero respect. So a guy like Steven, what that shows is the depth of that man's soul,

43:57.520 --> 44:03.360
 and courage and determination. It's hard to be selfless in this world anymore,

44:04.080 --> 44:08.560
 but I still know a lot of selfless people that just put on equipment every day,

44:08.560 --> 44:16.480
 bulletproof vests, fire, bunker gear, stethoscopes, you know, flak jackets, military helmets,

44:17.280 --> 44:23.600
 and they go in and they do it smiling. That young Marine that passed last week,

44:23.600 --> 44:29.040
 she was photographed and quoted as saying, I have my dream job, but she was holding a little

44:29.040 --> 44:36.240
 Afghani baby. And she was dead a few days later. She was so thrilled to be making $7 an hour helping

44:36.240 --> 44:42.320
 people, right? Isn't that huge? Like that to me says, that's a true sign of character right there.

44:42.320 --> 44:45.760
 And it's important for our society to elevate those people as heroes.

44:45.760 --> 44:52.800
 Let me ask you about firefighting. What do you think it means to be a great firefighter,

44:53.680 --> 44:59.760
 and a great man, a great human being in a situation like you were in in 9 11?

45:02.960 --> 45:07.760
 You know, that's, that's kind of a broad term. Like some, you know, you can go to different

45:07.760 --> 45:12.240
 firehouses and they might have a different definition of what they consider a great firefighter.

45:12.240 --> 45:18.240
 But I think in the industry as a whole, if you're willing to put

45:19.360 --> 45:25.120
 everyone else before you, especially your team, you know, as we say, there ain't no

45:25.120 --> 45:31.120
 I in team, right? It's TEAM and there's no I in there. It's all about those guys and girls next to

45:31.120 --> 45:39.120
 you. If you can do that, that makes you pretty great. You put everything else second and you

45:39.120 --> 45:45.920
 just run in and you run in with that team for strangers. You know, I've had the honor of I

45:45.920 --> 45:53.280
 spent almost 25 years of my adult life serving humanity, my country, my former city.

45:54.880 --> 45:59.600
 And the people I worked with were giants. And I don't mean that in height. I mean,

45:59.600 --> 46:05.520
 but I mean that in spirit and in soul. I saw some of the most heroic selfless acts.

46:05.520 --> 46:10.080
 And then I saw some of the behind the scenes that were so impressive. You know, we'd go to a fire

46:10.080 --> 46:16.560
 around Christmas and a family would lose everything. And even when I was a cop, same thing, you come

46:16.560 --> 46:22.560
 back either to the police precinct or the firehouse or the EMS station. And someone would put

46:22.560 --> 46:27.760
 together a collection and say, Hey guys, hey Lex, 50 bucks a man, you know, the Smiths down the

46:27.760 --> 46:31.760
 street just lost everything. We're going to go get some presents for the kids and some turkeys.

46:31.760 --> 46:38.240
 And not one of those guys questioned that. And they were making 12, 25 an hour and they still

46:38.240 --> 46:43.760
 came up with 50 bucks for that family. But see, that's the stuff the press won't show you, right?

46:43.760 --> 46:49.600
 They don't want to show that humanity, that soft edge. See, when you're a warrior, you need to have

46:49.600 --> 46:59.600
 this rough shield, this rough exterior, because if you don't, you die. But a true great firefighter

46:59.600 --> 47:06.800
 or a responder or a cop or a military personnel, they have that rough exterior with that soft on

47:06.800 --> 47:13.200
 the belly, that, you know, like that heart, right? And that's to me, the true great ones.

47:13.200 --> 47:18.720
 Some of them, they just have a hard time doing that, you know, there's no shame in showing

47:18.720 --> 47:22.560
 your soft side, you know? Well, you got your dad to say, I love you back.

47:22.560 --> 47:26.800
 No, that was huge. That took me 22 years, Lex.

47:26.800 --> 47:33.520
 So you were a firefighter for 21, almost 22 years. Why did you become a firefighter?

47:33.520 --> 47:38.880
 Oh, my dad, I mean, I was five years old when I went to his firehouse. And then there was these,

47:38.880 --> 47:43.040
 you know, at the time, they look like giants to me with mustaches. And they, you know,

47:43.680 --> 47:49.200
 and the trucks, trucks smelled like smoke and the gear smelled like smoke and the tires and,

47:49.200 --> 47:54.320
 you know, the diesel fuel. And I was like, this is, this is what I'm going to do. And then,

47:54.320 --> 47:58.560
 and then they bring you in the kitchen and they stuff you with ice cream and cake and, you know,

47:58.560 --> 48:03.760
 and then I go home to my mom, you know, shaking with a sugarcone and she's mad at my dad. But

48:03.760 --> 48:08.880
 yeah, it was just, oh, I was like, I got to do this. It was like, they were like a baseball team

48:08.880 --> 48:13.360
 in a garage with a truck and these big tools and big coats and helmets and they were just

48:13.360 --> 48:19.360
 laughing and having fun. And I'm like, yeah, man, I'm doing this. And I knew I was obsessed with it.

48:19.360 --> 48:24.320
 I mean, I was so pissed that the fireman's test came out when I was 14 and I couldn't take it. You

48:24.320 --> 48:30.800
 had to be 18. And it was done, you know, the test was graded and whatever. So my dad, you know,

48:30.800 --> 48:36.080
 now there's a copy circulating because it's old now. And he goes, yeah, yeah, this is what you're

48:36.080 --> 48:42.240
 in for. And I took it. And I, you know, did it like it was real. And I got a 99 and I was so pissed.

48:42.240 --> 48:46.960
 I said, I want to get hired. He goes, you can't, you're 14. Like, but I wanted, I just wanted

48:46.960 --> 48:53.520
 to do it so bad. And I just wanted to help people. I just wanted to be like my dad, you know, like

48:53.520 --> 48:59.280
 he'd come home smiling as tired as he was. And he fought fires in the 60s and 70s when the city was

48:59.280 --> 49:06.800
 burning. And he's still as exhausted as he was. He'd still be smiling. I wanted to smile at work.

49:06.800 --> 49:13.760
 And I used to, I got paid to laugh and joke. I got paid to cry sometimes. But man, we laughed

49:13.760 --> 49:18.640
 a lot. We really, it was the chop break. And it's just, it's just unending and it's great.

49:19.200 --> 49:23.040
 If you don't mind, can you tell me you were really kind enough to give me

49:25.040 --> 49:30.160
 one of these shirts with 114? Can you tell me the story of 114 of Tally Ho?

49:31.040 --> 49:35.840
 I wear proudly, I served eight years in that command and I didn't finish my career there.

49:37.120 --> 49:40.080
 I passed the lieutenants test. And once you do, you have to leave.

49:40.080 --> 49:47.920
 The story behind Tally Ho is back in World War II. There was this gentleman named Bad Jack

49:47.920 --> 49:54.000
 Carroll. And Jack was an airborne ranger. And my father in law was also on a department and he knew

49:54.000 --> 50:01.360
 Jack. And Jack came home, Jack jumped Normandy and stormed up through the Battle of the Bulge

50:01.360 --> 50:09.440
 in Bastogna. And he came back, greatest generation as they all did. And they got jobs. They went

50:09.440 --> 50:16.160
 right to work. And they were treated better back then, vets, right? And he got on a New York City

50:16.160 --> 50:23.840
 Fire Department and he got assigned to Ladder 114. And they first got radios back then. And when

50:23.840 --> 50:28.800
 Jack, he would drive the truck, you're up there with the officer, either the lieutenant or captain.

50:28.800 --> 50:34.320
 So the boss is off the truck, you operate the radio for them as the driver. So when they call

50:34.320 --> 50:40.240
 them and they'd say, Ladder 114, respond in the 52nd Street, 3rd Avenue, structure fire,

50:40.240 --> 50:45.280
 you're supposed to get back and say Ladder 114, 10, 4. But he refused to do that. He'd say Ladder

50:45.280 --> 50:51.200
 114, Tally Ho. Because that's what they'd yell when they jump out the plane. So all these years

50:51.200 --> 50:57.680
 later, it's stuck. And it's a little bit of a bragging right. But out of 350 engine and truck

50:57.680 --> 51:01.840
 companies in the whole New York City Fire Department, we're pretty much the only one that's

51:01.840 --> 51:06.560
 called by their nickname on the radio, not their number. So it tweaks some guys off and other

51:06.560 --> 51:13.680
 places. They may F you, Tally Ho. But it's just, yeah, it's a great, great heritage. And we're

51:13.680 --> 51:22.240
 really proud. And the shamrock was, he was Irish and a lot of the guys back then were Irish immigrants

51:22.240 --> 51:26.640
 from the area, from the neighborhood. And they would actually take the firetruck to church on

51:26.640 --> 51:31.760
 Sunday and park out front. And one guy would stay in it to hear the radio in case they got a call

51:31.760 --> 51:37.680
 So, yeah, that's the proud history. And you said that if I wear this around New York, am I getting

51:37.680 --> 51:43.600
 a little bit of... You might get a guy from the Bronx. Tally Ho, screw you. It's all that good

51:43.600 --> 51:51.680
 rivalry. We like to kid each other back and forth. Guys from Manhattan would say, yeah,

51:51.680 --> 51:55.920
 you guys are Brooklyn. Short buildings, tall stories. And they're like, yeah, but you guys

51:55.920 --> 52:03.200
 from Manhattan, tall buildings, no stories. It's all that jocular ball break and it's good stuff.

52:04.560 --> 52:10.560
 Let me ask a, I guess, a difficult question. If we just step back on the events of 911,

52:11.360 --> 52:18.880
 on the side of the people that flew into the towers, what do you take away from that day

52:18.880 --> 52:25.920
 about the nature, about human nature, about good and evil? How did that change your view of the world?

52:28.880 --> 52:36.080
 I witnessed evil firsthand. I remember later on well into that night when we were

52:36.800 --> 52:41.200
 trying to help get those police officers out. I remember looking up at the building, Century 21,

52:41.200 --> 52:47.040
 the store runs along the east side of the towers and it was still there. And, you know,

52:47.040 --> 52:53.120
 the debris had come down right almost to the edge. Century 21 is this old story department store in

52:53.120 --> 52:59.440
 New York City. And the sign was there and it was still lit up. Like some of the neon was broken.

52:59.440 --> 53:03.760
 And, but I think some of it was actually still lit up. And I just looked around and I was like,

53:04.960 --> 53:10.240
 this is, this is a war zone. Like we're at war. And, you know, we knew we were attacked. We heard

53:10.240 --> 53:15.920
 the fighter planes and, you know, back then it wasn't the extensive communication network.

53:15.920 --> 53:20.400
 And we had cell phones, but they were the old school flip phones and there was no news on them.

53:20.400 --> 53:26.640
 And so plus we didn't have a signal down there anyway. I couldn't reach my family for like 12,

53:26.640 --> 53:32.800
 13 hours. And my dad had deployed down to the ferry terminal to retrieve bodies.

53:33.840 --> 53:40.400
 He was retired, but he still went and they deployed him to go be basically the morgue

53:40.400 --> 53:45.920
 transport guys. They expected to be sending hundreds and thousands of bodies across on the

53:45.920 --> 53:51.760
 ferry. And they set up these tractor trailers as a mobile morgue. And that never happened because

53:52.640 --> 54:01.120
 there were no bodies to take. They were all buried. So it's so evil firsthand. I don't know how

54:01.120 --> 54:09.840
 someone can inflict such revenge or a vengeful act for in the name of anything in the name of

54:09.840 --> 54:14.720
 a religion and the name of a cause and the name like what the hell, you know,

54:14.720 --> 54:17.920
 were you ever able to make sense of that? Why men are able to commit such

54:17.920 --> 54:23.840
 acts of terror in the days and the years after? No, Lex, I haven't, you know,

54:25.920 --> 54:32.640
 my mom's from Ireland and I still have a lot of family there. And, you know, my great uncles,

54:32.640 --> 54:39.280
 one of them was dragged out and shot. He lived, but just based on a rumor that he was in the IRA.

54:40.400 --> 54:47.040
 And I wasn't happy to see what happened to my mom's people because they were victimized and

54:47.040 --> 54:56.640
 brutalized by England at that time. But blowing up bombs and killing innocents in the name of that,

54:56.640 --> 55:05.440
 it doesn't make it right. I couldn't justify something like that. I can see, you know,

55:05.440 --> 55:13.680
 I was a cop, I was a soldier and you never want to take life and in those jobs, but sometimes

55:13.680 --> 55:19.280
 you have to. But you don't do it with a vengeance. You don't do it with a thirst. You do it because

55:19.280 --> 55:26.080
 it's necessary for survival. When you do it out of a bloodlust, out of a thirst, out of a cause,

55:27.040 --> 55:34.960
 that's evil. There's something wrong with you. I have no, I respect life to the highest level.

55:34.960 --> 55:40.880
 I mean, I'm very, life is sacred to me. It's precious. It's beyond, it's not a commodity.

55:40.880 --> 55:49.040
 It's a gift. But to take life just so randomly, so there's something way wrong with that person

55:49.040 --> 55:55.840
 and maybe I'm a conflicted soul, but I would have no problem seeing someone like that put to death

55:55.840 --> 56:05.280
 because they do not deserve life. There's many children around this world that are being taught

56:05.280 --> 56:12.320
 to hate someone who's different than them just because the person who's allegedly teaching them

56:12.320 --> 56:19.760
 says so. I don't understand. Well, that starts with just having a basic respect and appreciation

56:19.760 --> 56:27.120
 of other human beings and that starts with empathy. And one of the reasons I love this country

56:27.120 --> 56:32.000
 while joking that I'm Russian, maybe you could say the same as you being Irish,

56:33.440 --> 56:37.840
 you're actually truly an American and that's why I consider myself very much an American.

56:37.840 --> 56:45.520
 And one of the reasons I love this country is it serves as a beacon. I still believe it serves as

56:45.520 --> 56:53.120
 a beacon of hope and that empathy and love for the rest of the world that hate is not going to get

56:53.120 --> 56:58.880
 you far. That love will get you a lot farther. And I still think sometimes it's easy to

56:58.880 --> 57:07.120
 see the press, mainstream media, you could see social networks, because you can make so much

57:07.120 --> 57:14.080
 money on division, sometimes because it makes so much money, it's easy to think like we're really

57:14.080 --> 57:19.120
 divided. I honestly don't think we are. That's just like the very surface level thing that we see

57:19.120 --> 57:25.600
 on Twitter. It's that you're 100% right. There's people out there that are maximizing off this

57:25.600 --> 57:33.360
 whole division. They want us divided. They want people angry because it sells. A lot of these

57:33.360 --> 57:39.360
 people that are in charge of certain organizations, well, they all seem to have nice cars and nice

57:39.360 --> 57:46.320
 houses and nice vacations. And they're constantly trying to convince everybody that we hate each

57:46.320 --> 57:52.320
 other. To me, I'll use a fireman analogy. It's like a little campfire. And if you just let the

57:52.320 --> 57:58.400
 embers flutter, they'll go out. But if you take a little cup of gasoline with those embers,

57:59.360 --> 58:04.720
 it'll blow right up in your face. And that's what a lot of these politicians and a lot of

58:04.720 --> 58:10.160
 these media folks are doing, because there's something in it for them. And I think it's

58:10.160 --> 58:16.080
 possible to defeat them with great leaders, with great spokespeople, with great human beings having

58:16.080 --> 58:21.840
 a voice. One of the powerful things with the internet is more and more people have a voice.

58:21.840 --> 58:28.480
 And I ultimately believe, certainly in America, but in the world, the good people outnumber

58:29.120 --> 58:34.880
 the assholes. Oh, I agree. There's days when I think the assholes are overrunning us.

58:35.600 --> 58:44.000
 But you know what? I think what the downfall of the world is, is ego and arrogance and people

58:44.000 --> 58:50.240
 that think they're better than that other guy. My parents raised me to be this way. My mom is

58:50.240 --> 58:56.320
 such a sweet, gentle soul. She's an immigrant. She came here at 16 years old. She helps everybody

58:56.320 --> 59:01.280
 but herself, right? She's just one of those people. She's sick. She's got Parkinson's.

59:01.280 --> 59:06.320
 You'd never know it. And she's still flying around her condo complex helping everybody,

59:06.320 --> 59:12.800
 because that's what she does. She loves to help people. But she's been in their shoes. She's been

59:12.800 --> 59:19.440
 poor. She's sick. Her husband was sick. She's had all sorts of suffering and loss in her life.

59:19.440 --> 59:26.320
 My granddad died when my mom was 10. And she was one of 10 children that survived out of 14.

59:27.200 --> 59:34.480
 She knows hard times, but she so appreciates the good times and the goodness of this country.

59:35.520 --> 59:40.640
 You know, the fire department and the police department and military, it taught me a lot

59:40.640 --> 59:44.880
 about empathy and trying to really feel for someone and put yourself in there.

59:44.880 --> 59:51.120
 Their situation, I remember years back, I was a much younger fireman. I probably

59:51.680 --> 59:59.200
 five years on a job. And I was sent down to the next firehouse over to fill in. We would get

59:59.200 --> 1:00:05.840
 sent around randomly when they needed an extra guy. And someone came banging on a firehouse door

1:00:06.720 --> 1:00:11.600
 and in the tenement apartment next door, they said there was an older woman that was unconscious.

1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:18.560
 So we dispatched ourselves and we ran over with a medical kit. And it was an elderly woman laying

1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:25.360
 there on the bed. And she was obviously not breathing. She was obviously in cardiac arrest

1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:32.160
 and an older gentleman that was holding her hand just inconsolably crying. And it turned out

1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:39.760
 it was her husband and they were married for 65 years. And normally we would just respectfully

1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:46.320
 ask the family members to just step aside and let us do our work. And I realized that he wouldn't

1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:53.520
 leave her side. So I kind of gave the crew a wink and they were doing CPR and what they had to.

1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:59.680
 And I just let him keep holding her hand. And I said, sir, if you could you just come over just

1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:08.160
 a little bit so we can work. And I held his hand as he held hers. And I said, sir, I said,

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:14.080
 do you have faith? And he did. And I said, would you like to pray with me for your wife?

1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:22.080
 And he said, I would like to. So we said the Lord's prayer and I just asked God to protect

1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:28.720
 her and bless her. And I think he realized that she didn't have a chance. But we still gave her

1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:35.680
 that chance and we got her in the ambulance. And maybe it was wrong to try to make it look like

1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:44.000
 we could save her. But you know, you can't really not try. But the one beautiful moment was he thanked

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:52.080
 me and he was almost okay with it at that point. Like he wasn't as upset. He wasn't as distraught

1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:57.200
 because I tried to just humanize that situation of what we were trying to do. We were trying to

1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:04.960
 do our best. But we also tried to be compassionate to his sadness. And it just, I walked away just

1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:10.560
 feeling so good, even though it was a tragic situation and she did pass that he came by to

1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:18.880
 thank us days later. And it's just heartbreaking. But it just happens many, many times throughout

1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:25.680
 the country every day. People get that opportunity as a responder to be that last bridge to the

1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:31.440
 family and the loved one. And you only get that opportunity once sometimes. And you really have

1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:36.240
 to, to me, it's like your moment to shine. You know, you could just be very, very dismissive

1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:42.400
 and very rude. Or you could be compassionate and just show, Hey, I have a mom. I have a grandma.

1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:46.800
 I have, you know, and just in your mind, pretend that that's who you're working on and that's who

1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:52.320
 you're with. So that moment of compassion, that moment of empathy, even if his brief can be the

1:02:52.320 --> 1:03:00.160
 thing that saves the person from suffering, make the difference between suffering and overcoming

1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:05.840
 in the face of tragedy. Yes. Like I felt that even though obviously his loss was still huge,

1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:11.120
 it just made it a little more bearable and, you know, tried to just take his grief down

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:16.880
 to a lower level. And it made me feel just feel really good about doing it.

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:21.040
 That's a powerful way to see the job of a first responder. Of course, you have to deal with certain

1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:26.880
 aspects of the tragedy, but it's to provide somebody with that moment of compassion.

1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:31.120
 Yeah. And, you know, I made it a little habit because sometimes with faith, it's a little bit

1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:36.880
 of a tricky subject. So every time I had someone who died, which unfortunately was many, many

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:42.000
 times, I would, I would just touch their hand and just say a little quick prayer and just say,

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:47.120
 look, you know, I hope you're moving on to a better place. I hope if you did have faith that

1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:52.320
 it's, it's, it's strong as you depart. And if you didn't have faith, I hope maybe at your last

1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:57.600
 moment that you found some and you just found some closure. So that was just my little, my little

1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:02.800
 ritual. I think I just, you know, I felt it was important that, that, that person, even though

1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:08.080
 they were strangers, just had someone there just sort of hoping for the best for them in their last

1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:20.640
 moments. You mentioned cancer. You had a rare leukemia due to all the work that you did at

1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:29.280
 ground zero. Can you maybe talk to the experience of just breathing through those days and what

1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:35.120
 that was like being unable to breathe, being overwhelmed by all of the dust in the air?

1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:44.480
 Yes. The first day, especially we, we didn't have equipment. We ran, you know, we didn't have

1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:50.720
 breathing apparatus and then we were handed little 69 cent hardware store dust mask, you know,

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:56.320
 those little thin paint masks that would just get sweated up and, you know, sticking to your face

1:04:56.320 --> 1:05:02.080
 within 30 seconds. So you would, you just, they were useless. And what, what you wound up feeling

1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:07.200
 like was that you, you swallowed a box of razor blades because there was glass and it was cement

1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:13.760
 and it was just so caustic. And I remember that night, you know, when we went back just to get

1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:19.920
 some medical relief for the few hours, we were walking up the hill to the firehouse because

1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:27.440
 they dropped us off like a block away down at engine 201s and quarters. And one of the older

1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:31.600
 firemen as we're walking up the block, we're all struggling. We're all having a hard time breathing

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:38.320
 and just, I mean, I felt like I was dying literally. It was pretty bad. And just remember the one

1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:42.240
 guy going, now we're all dead. And I said, no, no, we made it. We made it. He goes, no, you don't get

1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:48.720
 a kid. He said, we just breathed in poison after poison for, for hours. And then that went into

1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:53.360
 days and then went into months. He says, we're all dead men. This is going to take us all.

1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:59.840
 And I, I thought he was crazy. And then now years later, like starting in 0304,

1:06:00.640 --> 1:06:05.760
 guys just started coming down with these really rare and advanced cancers. And then

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:11.840
 it just, it just stopped being a coincidence with the number of guys. And they were young.

1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:17.360
 Just one, one of the first guys, John McNamara, he was 33 or 34. And he came down

1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:27.440
 colon cancer and it took him quickly in 2000. He was in 2005. And I kind of said to, you know,

1:06:27.440 --> 1:06:31.200
 friends and family, I said, I feel like I'm running through a minefield. And I wonder when

1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:36.320
 my, I'm going to step on my mind, because everybody's going to get sick. And I wasn't

1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:42.400
 feeling well from 2008 on, just, I just, I couldn't put a, I couldn't put my finger on it,

1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:51.360
 but I just wasn't right. And then in 2011, I failed my medical. My bloods, my bloods came back

1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:58.800
 horrifically wrong. And they pulled me off the truck, but they strung me out for a month. The

1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:03.680
 doctors in the fire department, one of them said my spleen was engorged because there was

1:07:03.680 --> 1:07:09.280
 probably drinking myself to death. Like as he said, most of the guys did after 9 11,

1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:14.000
 which was pretty wrong of him in stereotypical, you know, just, just to stereotype and to

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:19.920
 categorize and guy couldn't have cared less. He just, he was so crude and nasty. And then

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:26.320
 my one doctor who was my doctor on the outside, she, my blood pressure was 240 over 140. My

1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:31.920
 spleen was about to rupture. She didn't even show up for my appointment. And I went down,

1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:37.280
 passed out, the paramedics responded. She got into an argument with a paramedic because

1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:41.680
 for big ego, and basically telling him there wasn't really anything wrong. And he's looking

1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:48.000
 at my paperwork going, this guy's got leukemia. And he overwrote her. He raced me out of there

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:55.840
 down to Brooklyn Methodist. And the doctor, the charge physician, the ER physician, he says,

1:07:55.840 --> 1:08:02.000
 you're not leaving. You're in a bad way. And I said, what is it? He said, like, I need for,

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:07.200
 you know, because I need, I need a little while to figure it out. He goes, but you probably have

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:11.920
 one of a few different types of leukemia. He said, I'll drill into your hip, take your marrow and

1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:17.120
 find out. And he said, but in the meantime, we'll get the swelling on the spleen down,

1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:21.520
 like some sort of rapid medicines and whatnot, because my spleen was about to rupture.

1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:27.200
 And I had no blood platelets left, which is your clotter. So I basically would have bled

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:33.280
 to death. And I found out from my team of doctors that I had about 48 hours to live.

1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:39.360
 And that really set me off. I was infuriated because I was telling them for a long time

1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:44.720
 that I was sick. And the doctors failed you. The few doctors in the beginning failed you.

1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:54.080
 I felt very betrayed and other guys had died. And I had it out with that one doctor. I basically

1:08:54.080 --> 1:09:00.000
 told her she was fired from my case and she's pretty politically in charge person and I didn't

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:05.040
 care. I jeopardized my job for it because it was my life. And I got the sense that

1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:10.240
 she didn't really, it didn't really matter to her. She didn't have any empathy, as you say.

1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:18.080
 It was exact. So why for her, why for a few others, was there not a special care, a special

1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:23.760
 compassion for, first of all, all humans, but human beings in your position, especially a

1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:28.640
 firefighter, a first responder? You know, Alex, I think what it is in the department,

1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:34.960
 their title is just to get us back to duty as quickly as possible when we are either injured

1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:40.960
 or sick because what happens then is your replacement is now in overtime. So you're out

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:46.480
 being paid on medical leave, but then they need to replace your spot and then that costs more money.

1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:53.280
 So I think it's just behooves them to get as many personnel back and especially during the

1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:57.600
 summertime, you know, they look at it like, oh, maybe you want a few extra days off to,

1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:04.560
 you know, go to the beach. And this one doctor, he tipped his hand back as if like I was drinking

1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:09.520
 an alcohol beverage. He says, hey, busy summer, because I asked him to look at my spleen, which

1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:15.680
 was sticking out of my abdomen like a football. And I said, excuse me, sir. I said, how dare you

1:10:15.680 --> 1:10:22.480
 assume that I'm abusing alcohol because, you know, alcohol abuse sometimes will present itself as

1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:28.160
 the spleen is engorged in having an issue. So you automatically just assume that that was my

1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:34.080
 situation. Wouldn't even give me an exam. And I was horrified. I was so angry. I mean, I wanted

1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:39.920
 to punch this guy out. And I literally was screaming at him and an executive officer came in to

1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:44.720
 diffuse it and sent me to another doctor. And when I showed her my paperwork, she was horrified.

1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:50.240
 She was like, what did he say? And she said, oh, okay, go to your regular doctor tomorrow,

1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:55.840
 who was one of the department doctors. And she just, it was just an indifference. It was like,

1:10:56.400 --> 1:11:02.160
 I don't know, I was shocked at the lack of compassion. But you know what, that being said,

1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:09.600
 I'm past it. I did, you know, life moves on. The team of doctors, I ended up with a Methodist

1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:16.800
 and my subsequent oncologist, Dr. Peter Mansell, world class, just incredible human being. My

1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:21.840
 Dr. Pete is just, I love him. I just, I love him like a friend, like a big brother, like a father,

1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:28.720
 like a, my primary oncology care nurse, Mike Nunez, was just incredible human being. And,

1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:34.400
 and he knew I was frightened because I had to get two and a half years of chemo compressed

1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:41.680
 into seven days. Or I was dead. These massive bags of chemo that never stopped. And, and

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.800
 they, they burned the minute, the minute they went into your body, you felt like you were

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:52.160
 burning to death from the inside out. And Mike, when Mike came in to hook me up, he said,

1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:58.160
 look, I have to wear a hazmat suit. This stuff is so caustic that if it, if it drips, it'll burn

1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:02.880
 whatever it touches. And I was like, but Mike, you're going to put that in my body. How, how the

1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:07.360
 hell is it not going to kill me? He says, no, no, this is exactly what it's supposed to do. Trust

1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:13.520
 me. So when he prepped the IV tube to get it flowing, it spilled onto the tube and the tube

1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:18.960
 started to smoke and burn. And I, I went, I said, no effing way, Mike, you're not putting that in

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:23.760
 me. No way, no way. And he goes, listen, let me get another one. Let me start it over. And here

1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:28.480
 he is wearing a hazmat suit, looking at me and I'm going, this is, this is insane. And he goes,

1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:34.240
 he looked at me, he took my hand and he says, no, if you don't take it, you're dead. He says,

1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:39.520
 you got those three kids. I'm sorry. I have no other option. You're dead. And I said, all right,

1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:46.320
 Mike, okay. And he hooked me up. And you know what, it was, it was like, you know, if you do drink

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:51.360
 alcohol and you have like a shot or want, you know, strong, strong type spirit and you start

1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:57.840
 feeling that burn. Well, the minute he, he hit me in the vein, it just started going up my arm,

1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:04.480
 burning and then up my shoulder, across my neck, into my head, across the rest of my body,

1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:10.800
 within a minute down to my feet. And I was writhing in pain for seven days. And I was praying to die.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:17.120
 I was the seventh rescuer in six months to come down with the rarest leukemia there is. There's

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:22.880
 only 500 cases in all North America a year. And seven of us came down in six months. Two guys

1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:29.200
 died during treatment, seven responders, police fire. Two guys died in the first couple of days

1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:33.440
 of the treatment because it's so vicious. You live or your heart, your kidney, something will fail.

1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:38.400
 And I was praying and I was praying, but I wanted to die. I was in so much pain.

1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:43.760
 And I wouldn't take a pain killer because I know people with some issues and I just didn't want to

1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:50.320
 go there. And finally on the last day I gave in, I said, please, I can't do this anymore.

1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:54.320
 I was literally like jumping out of my skin and they gave me something,

1:13:55.440 --> 1:14:00.240
 but it had burned out my mind. It burned out my body. I couldn't hear. I could barely see. It was

1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:08.240
 vicious, but it worked. And my nurses especially, they just, they were so dedicated and devoted.

1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:14.480
 And I was not an easy patient because I was in a lot of pain. It was bad. And it was,

1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:20.400
 drove my friends, my family crazy. It was just, it wasn't good. But on that first night,

1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:27.120
 I had a quick vision of all these people that I loved that were dead, that died. A lot of them

1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:33.840
 in the trade center. And I saw Johnny, I saw friends I grew up with. The last one was my

1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:39.360
 mother in law who had passed six months before and she died of, she was in a coma. She had a stroke.

1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:43.600
 She had a horrible, horrible last six months of life. And she wasn't fair because

1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:48.160
 she was so religious. She went to church every day, the Val Catholic woman.

1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:55.200
 And all of a sudden I see her and she's smiling. And we used to talk a lot. It's the Irish thing,

1:14:55.200 --> 1:15:00.080
 like the gab, the gift of gab. And she's to call me a boyfriend because we'd sit and talk for

1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:05.120
 hours and talk about books and about movies and about food. And I love her. She's my friend.

1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:10.480
 And she'd say, you know, my boyfriend's here. And all of a sudden she's smiling and she says,

1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:16.160
 hi, my boyfriend. I says, nan, nan, what are you doing? She goes, he's not ready. He doesn't want

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:21.840
 you. You got to go back. Got things to do. And I'm like, no, nan, nan, it hurts so much. Please,

1:15:21.840 --> 1:15:27.120
 please take me. And she laughs. She goes, no, no, not yet. I'll see you. And she just faded away.

1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:36.000
 And one of my doctors on my team, she was, she had, she had a problem with religion. And that's

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:40.720
 okay. I understand that, you know, I'm not a, I'm not a preacher. I have a faith, but I don't

1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:46.560
 preach it. I don't push it. I just, you know, live and let live. So she sent in this shrink

1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:52.720
 to see me. And I was messed up from the chemo, but I knew what I was seeing. I knew what I was

1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:59.840
 saying. And he was, he was a Jewish gentleman. He was a rabbi also in a synagogue. And I actually

1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:05.360
 had responded in that district. And he knew 114 would run into Burl Park. Oh yeah, I see,

1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:10.080
 totally. Oh, they come down the street, you know, and he asked me to tell him the story. And I did.

1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:16.320
 And he started laughing and he scared me now. I said, dock it. Am I really crazy? He said,

1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:23.680
 no, no. He said, I believe you, my friend. He said, we, we share the same God. He goes, we,

1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:29.760
 we work in the same corporation, but in different departments. And he says, he says, you, you did

1:16:29.760 --> 1:16:33.920
 see your mother in law. He says, your faith is that strong. He said, I've had many patients

1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:39.680
 express the same sentiments. He said, so I want you to listen to her and fight and be strong.

1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:43.520
 And he said, so what else do you want to talk about? I said, well, I don't know,

1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:47.360
 doc, am I not messed up? He goes, no, no, he goes, they're paying me for an hour. It only took 20

1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:53.120
 minutes. So we watched the Yankee game together. But, but it was just again, it showed the human

1:16:53.120 --> 1:16:58.960
 condition. Here, here's these two men of two totally different faiths. And yet we shared that,

1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:07.440
 that bond of faith and he had empathy and he had sympathy. And he, he's, he saw me and many other

1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:13.600
 patients. So he just didn't assume and he, and he gave me a fair shake and I will always be grateful

1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:19.120
 to him for that. Through any of this, the, the pain you had to go through with the leukemia,

1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:24.400
 but also the, the days of 9 11 after, did your faith get challenged?

1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:31.200
 You know, like it was strange. It was times it was so angry, you know, there's that range of

1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:37.200
 emotions, the anger, the denial, the depression, the this to that. And this is the weirdest thing.

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:44.320
 It was, it was mostly, I knew my career was over. And they retired me out of the job. That, that

1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:51.120
 oct, I got sick in August and that October, they told me I was out. And by the time I was processed

1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:56.320
 and, you know, used up my, my leaves and whatever you want to say it was, I was, I was officially

1:17:56.320 --> 1:18:03.760
 retired in January of 02. And it was less than six months. And I'm there walking my dog one day,

1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:09.120
 my rescued Greyhound, who I miss. She was such a soul. God, she lived to be almost 13, Katie. And

1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:13.920
 we're walking into snow and I got the call. I was retired and I looked at her and I'm like,

1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:17.680
 Katie, what am I going to do? And she just looked up and said, we're going to go on a lot more walks,

1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:24.000
 you know. And I was so sad. And I was so sad. I was so angry because I lost my priesthood.

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:29.040
 I loved helping people. I really like, I would have done it for free. I would never tell Mayor

1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:33.680
 Bloomberg that, right? He's all about the book, right? But like, you know, honestly, I would have,

1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:37.600
 I would have been a New York City fireman. I would have paid them to do it, you know?

1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:43.760
 And I wasn't allowed anymore. That's it. You have over 20 years and you have cancer. You know,

1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:48.720
 back when my dad got sick, they'd let you hang around for 10, 12 years in an office. But not

1:18:48.720 --> 1:18:55.680
 now. Now it's all about the bottom line. And, but I was more depressed about losing a job than

1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:59.600
 almost losing my life. Like as crazy as that sounds, you know? And it just...

1:19:00.640 --> 1:19:07.360
 It was more than a job. I mean, it's a way of life. It's also as your family, your father,

1:19:07.360 --> 1:19:12.480
 your, your carrying torture, your father's... Oh, my friend. I love my friends. I love,

1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:18.080
 we work 24 hours shifts together. You cook, you clean, you break each other's jobs relentlessly.

1:19:18.080 --> 1:19:25.280
 I mean, it was, I love those guys so much. I mean, I hope that my kids and anyone that I know

1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:32.160
 and care about, I hope they can experience the bond of that brotherhood that I experienced in

1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:36.720
 my life. It was so... God, I would give anything to have it back. Just, yeah.

1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:42.160
 Can I ask you about New York? So when I have... Unfortunately, I've never lived in New York.

1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:46.880
 I visit. I've always wanted to live there for a bit. Obviously, it's a very different experience

1:19:46.880 --> 1:19:53.680
 to have really lived in New York for many, many years. But there's a few friends of mine that are

1:19:53.680 --> 1:20:01.680
 from... They got similar accent as yours. Yeah. That are a little bit saddened. Perhaps it's temporary,

1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:08.560
 but perhaps not. They don't seem to think so of what New York has become, especially with COVID.

1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:14.960
 It's losing some of the spirit of New York. Do you have that sense? Do you have a hope for

1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:21.840
 the city that has been so defining to what is America? You know, my heart's broken.

1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:27.600
 I had moved to New Jersey many years ago, but I still have a close attachment to New York.

1:20:27.600 --> 1:20:34.480
 My parents are still there. Many, many family members. And I've since now moved to Tennessee.

1:20:34.480 --> 1:20:40.160
 I needed to go somewhere quiet. I wanted to heal my fractured soul. And I'm in the middle

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:48.160
 of a beautiful farming rural area in middle Tennessee. And so they probably called me a

1:20:48.160 --> 1:20:52.480
 sellout back in New York for leaving, but it's not the same city. And it's sad.

1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:01.440
 I'll refrain from the politics and the finger pointing, but it's a mess compared to what it was.

1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:10.880
 And I did Broadway theater security for many years. And I started to see it slide with stuff that

1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:17.680
 was happening like, you know, public urination and defecation and just like, you know, tourists don't

1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:26.080
 want to see that, right? And I had an unfortunate incident two years ago. I was jumped by 14

1:21:26.080 --> 1:21:31.760
 ages coming off the subway. And they were pissed off because I was wearing an American flag hat.

1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:39.120
 And I don't know. I'm not really sure why, but it left me, I got out of it. Okay.

1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:45.840
 Okay. But I was taken back. They were literally videoing it. And the kid was just throwing

1:21:45.840 --> 1:21:49.680
 shadow punches at my face wanting to beat me up. And I finally looked him in the eyes and I was

1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:54.720
 like, oh boy, I'm a little too old for this. And body's a little broken down for chemo. And I

1:21:54.720 --> 1:22:00.240
 finally just said, all right, all right, I just had enough. I wanted to go home. Just worked a 17

1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:05.120
 hour shift as a stagehand. And I was so taken back. I was so insulted. I'm saying, you know,

1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:11.280
 I spent my life protecting this city. And now I'm getting attacked like for nothing. And I just,

1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:17.440
 I gave up and maybe I should have given it a little more time. But it's, I don't know,

1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:23.760
 it's turned into an angry place. It's turned into, I think there's a lot of people that aren't getting

1:22:23.760 --> 1:22:29.200
 the resources they need. In a sense, there's a lot of mental illness. There's a lot of homelessness.

1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:35.760
 There's a lot of violent people just roaming around the streets and it's not good. It's not safe. And

1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:41.280
 tourists are not going to come back. Even just leading up to the COVID, I had some tourists

1:22:41.280 --> 1:22:46.480
 saying to me, I won't be back. And now I can only imagine that it's just gotten exponentially worse.

1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:50.800
 But I hope there's a chance it'll swing back because it is. It's the gateway to the world.

1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:59.040
 To me, my grandfather came, you know, from Denmark. He landed in Ellis Island in the 20s. You know,

1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:02.880
 American success story, 25 bucks in his pocket, didn't speak the language,

1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:09.200
 had a sponsor family in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. And he made it. You know, he ended up dying

1:23:09.200 --> 1:23:14.640
 owning a bakery at one point and then an apartment building. And he did pretty well for himself,

1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:20.320
 for an immigrant who was poor. And my mom, my Irish mother landed in the same neighborhood,

1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:27.440
 Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 16 years old, worked as a cashier 50, 60 hours a week in the supermarket

1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:36.080
 and finished school at night, married my father to Feynman, and lived the American dream. And it

1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:42.800
 was all from New York. And my father's mom was from Irish immigrants. And they all landed in

1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:48.640
 Ellis Island. Well, my mom didn't because it was closed at that point. But there's people

1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:54.000
 breaking down the doors to come to this country, right? There's no one breaking down the doors to

1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:59.280
 leave. And this is a problem I have, but people that aren't grateful for being here. And this,

1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:05.040
 again, it's not political, just straight down the middle fastball. If you don't like it here,

1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:09.760
 I'll show you the door. I'll get you the plane ticket. I mean, would you want to live back in

1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:14.720
 Russia compared to here? Would you, you might because of family ties. But I mean, if you had no

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:19.920
 ties to Russia, or would you want to go to China right now and possibly end up in a labor camp?

1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:26.640
 There's people busting down the doors to get to this place. It's not perfect. It's got its flaws.

1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:34.240
 It's got its blemishes. But it's a damn great place. It's the best country in the world.

1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:39.760
 Yeah. And some of it, so first of all, I have hope for New York. I think that culture is very

1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:45.280
 difficult to kill. I think it will persevere. And I think ultimately the same story with New York

1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:51.920
 as with the rest of the United States. It has to do with leaders. And I'm always hopeful that great

1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:58.960
 leaders will emerge. I agree. And the kind of leadership we see now and the kind of conversations

1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:06.240
 we have now, I think has to do with prosperity and comfort. And in the face of hardship, I think

1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:12.400
 great leaders will emerge. And I just think ultimately in the long arc of history,

1:25:13.200 --> 1:25:17.360
 well leaders shouldn't become rich. They shouldn't become rich in the process, right?

1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:24.320
 You shouldn't go into political office as an alleged lunchbox kind of guy and then come out

1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:30.000
 eating at the best steakhouse in the world. I mean, that's the problem with politics, right?

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.960
 My Irish grandmother, God rest her, used to say, those politicians, they're all dirty

1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:39.920
 diapers. They're full of shit and they stink. And it's true. I don't give a crap what party they're

1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:46.080
 in. Yeah, greed and power. We had to beg these guys, beg them for federal legislation to cover

1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:50.400
 our medical bills, right? There's a gentleman, John Field from the Field Good Foundation.

1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:57.760
 This guy is a lion of a man, a general, but with a soft, big, great heart. And John,

1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:05.840
 John is a former construction worker who came to the 911 site the day after. He was one of those

1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:11.360
 guys cutting the steel with torches and craning it out of the air. One of those hard hats that just,

1:26:12.320 --> 1:26:19.920
 that never got the credit and the praise that we did as responders. And I don't mean that as a

1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:28.640
 knock to responders, right? I mean, we lost 37 poor authority police officers, 23 NYPD officers,

1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:35.440
 about a dozen emergency medical technicians and paramedics, three court officers from New York

1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:42.160
 State courts and two federal agents and I hope, and 343 New York City firefighters. We lost a ton

1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:50.640
 of responders, but the recovery workers thankfully weren't killed in that process, but there's hundreds

1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:56.000
 of them now who are dead from illnesses because they came down to recover our people and the

1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:03.920
 civilians and the poor lost souls that were killed at work that day. And John literally almost lost

1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:11.680
 his foot in a construction accident at the site, an 8,000 pound iBeam tore off half of his foot,

1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:18.080
 ended up with massive sepsis, six months in the hospital, hundreds of thousand dollars in medical

1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:23.360
 bills and then no one wanted to pay him. So here's a guy who's going to lose his house,

1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:29.200
 lose his life, lose everything. And now they never forget it started quick, right?

1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:36.160
 And he went on a mission, formed his Feel Good Foundation. His last name is Feel,

1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:44.400
 FEAL, Feel Good Foundation. And this man literally went to Washington DC with his army, as he called

1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:49.200
 it. And I was honored and blessed to be with him a couple, only a couple of times. I wish I had

1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:57.120
 dedicated some more time to it. And what it was with John is he set out on a mission to get,

1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:02.080
 and initially what he did is he got funding to take care of responders who were in that limbo,

1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:05.680
 who couldn't get their medical bills paid, who couldn't make their mortgages, who couldn't make

1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:10.800
 their car payments, who couldn't make their childcare payments. And John just took it upon

1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:15.360
 his own to get donations and take care of you while you were suffering, right? I got a call

1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:19.440
 when I got out of the hospital. You okay? You need anything? I said, who is this? It's John

1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:24.720
 Feel. I said, aren't you that construction worker? Yeah, you need anything? I'm pretty good right

1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:29.760
 now. I said, I appreciate it. Foam ring again a few weeks later. Hey, John Feel, you need anything?

1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:34.320
 I'm like, this guy's incredible. But there's people who needed stuff and he was getting it done.

1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:40.480
 And he with his army had to chase these politicians through the halls of Congress

1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:47.120
 to get funding to cover the medical bills. I was getting sued for $125,000 for my month

1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:53.760
 stay in the cancer ward. And I couldn't believe it. I said, well, wait a minute, I have insurance.

1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:58.800
 They're like, oh, no, no, this is terrorism related. We don't cover that. So usually then

1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:03.840
 workers comp will cover your own duty injury or illness. Oh, no, no, no. Leukemia is not covered

1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:09.840
 on that. We don't cover that. So then the ping pong game starts and I'm literally have people

1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:14.480
 showing up taking pictures of my kids in front of the house. And I went and grabbed the guy one

1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:19.360
 day by the collar. So who the hell are you? So I'm a private investigator. We're putting a lien

1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:24.560
 on this property due to a nonpayment of a bill. I said, okay, I understand. Do your job. Let me

1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:30.720
 bring my kids inside, take all the pictures you want. Don't step on my front lawn. And I went in

1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:38.000
 the house. I closed my room, my door, my door, my room and I cried. I said, I can't believe this.

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:44.240
 I spent my entire adult life trying to help people give of myself and I can't even get my

1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:50.000
 medical bill paid. Well, John Field got my medical bill paid. He finally got these politicians with

1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:58.240
 his team, firefighter Ray Pfeiffer, who has since died, fought with terminal cancer for nine years

1:29:58.240 --> 1:30:05.040
 in a wheelchair. Literally at the end came out of hospice to go finalize getting us this coverage.

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:11.680
 Detective Luis Alvarez, who testified days before he died in front of Congress.

1:30:11.680 --> 1:30:19.360
 And a bunch of other guys that were really, really sick and we had to shame these people into signing

1:30:19.360 --> 1:30:26.240
 on. And luckily we had John Stuart come on and literally just howling these guys and shame them

1:30:26.240 --> 1:30:34.480
 and embarrass them. And what it all stemmed from was in 2006, the first death that was determined

1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:39.600
 to be linked to 911. There was others, but the first one that was officially linked was a New

1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:44.720
 York City police detective who initially, the city said he died of advanced lung disease. His

1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:49.920
 lungs were protruding out of his body and he was on painkillers and it was so bad at the end that

1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:54.960
 the doctors said just grind them up, snort them, drink it, whatever you need to do to get instant

1:30:54.960 --> 1:31:01.040
 relief. So when they found the talcum from the pill lining in his lungs, they said, oh no, this is

1:31:01.040 --> 1:31:07.120
 opiate abuse. He didn't die of lung disease. So they said, and the mayor was quoted as saying,

1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:14.000
 he is not a hero. Well, shame on you, Mr. Mayor. He was a hero. And his father, who was a retired

1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:20.160
 police chief, married up with the Feel Good Foundation and John Stuart and Ray Pfeiffer,

1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:28.080
 Detective Alvarez. And they got us all covered. But it took so long, like it was so heartbreaking,

1:31:28.080 --> 1:31:33.200
 these people who were lining up three deep politicians, three deep to catch a picture

1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:39.280
 with a responder so they can tweet, hashtag never forget and hashtag look at me and hey,

1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:43.840
 how am I doing? All that bull crap. But they didn't know. They were nowhere to be freaking found.

1:31:43.840 --> 1:31:49.840
 I literally witnessed them hiding in cloak rooms, running down hallways away from us,

1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:54.400
 those freaking cowards. That's cowardice. Can I just linger on the John Stuart thing,

1:31:54.400 --> 1:32:01.040
 the comedian actor, John Stuart, his testimony before Congress over the benefits for 911 first

1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:07.920
 responders. I mean, there's a lot of important human beings in this story, but he has a big

1:32:07.920 --> 1:32:11.600
 voice and he spoke from the heart. What do you make of that testimony?

1:32:12.400 --> 1:32:19.680
 Oh, it was heartfelt. I mean, he spoke, look, I mean, John was a, you know,

1:32:19.680 --> 1:32:23.760
 a polarizing guy, right? There's certain things like over the years, he was cutting edge and I

1:32:23.760 --> 1:32:28.320
 might not have agreed with all of his, you know, well, you know, some stuff, some not, right? You

1:32:28.320 --> 1:32:32.240
 know, like we all, but I'll tell you, I found him as funny. I enjoyed his humor.

1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:37.680
 I would love the two of you to have a conversation. No, but again, I love a guy where you can have,

1:32:37.680 --> 1:32:40.960
 you can have a difference in opinions. That's the beautiful thing about the firehouse kitchen.

1:32:40.960 --> 1:32:45.760
 I mean, it could get raucous and now I don't know, it's a little different situation, but

1:32:46.320 --> 1:32:51.200
 maybe back in the day, some funny stuff. But yeah, John, John literally just took his talents.

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:57.360
 You would think he was speaking from the heart of a fireman or a cop or soldier or a marine or,

1:32:57.360 --> 1:33:05.440
 you know, someone who was there, but I think he especially got to know Ray so well and Ray had

1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:11.920
 this stack of mass cards from, you know, the funeral cards they give out. It looks like,

1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:18.000
 you know, a larger business card that's laminated and Ray had a stack of them he would carry around.

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:24.160
 I think it was close to a hundred cards and John saw it and he said, what's that? He says,

1:33:24.160 --> 1:33:29.440
 these are my cards. He said, for what? He says, for my brother's funerals. He was like, oh my

1:33:29.440 --> 1:33:36.560
 God, you've been to that many funerals. He goes, yeah, this is just the ones I made. Like, you

1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:45.200
 know, and John, I think was just stunned. And John actually had that stack of cards after Ray

1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:50.640
 passed and like said, look, just look at these. There's going to be more of these cards. We have

1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:57.440
 one guy a week or girl, one responder or recovery worker or someone who actually resided down there.

1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:04.640
 There's more than one a week dying. It's one a day dying on average. And on average,

1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:11.200
 two people are diagnosed with a 9.11 cancer or disease. Right now, the worst part is there's

1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:16.640
 autoimmune diseases flying off the graph and you're not covered under the legislation.

1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:21.600
 And by the grace of God, my cancer is covered. If my cancer comes back, I mean,

1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:25.840
 I'm in remission. It's technically incurable, but I've been blessed. I'm staying ahead of

1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:30.800
 this stuff going on 10 years. But if it comes back with a vengeance tomorrow and takes me,

1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:35.760
 you know, at least my wife will get my pension and be able to live her life without fear.

1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:41.440
 But my friends who are suffering from these advanced autoimmunes, their wives get nothing.

1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:49.200
 Their pension dies with them. And we're hoping that, you know, John and his army can shame these

1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:54.640
 politicians once again to have the kindness and decency to cover these autoimmunes.

1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:59.760
 You know, they're throwing a lot of money around that a lot of things lately. And

1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:05.600
 this is one that they won't. And these are lives in the balance who really need it.

1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:12.800
 And John had this strong line. They did their jobs, do yours. Talking to the politicians.

1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:21.840
 Yeah. And it's a strong wake up call that it's not about the Twitter or the social media or

1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:27.600
 all that kind of stuff. You have a job to do and you have to, it's that compassion

1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:35.280
 implemented in the form of money of helping people that were there for you when you needed help.

1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:40.880
 Well, we had a guy, I mean, I might get audited out of this one, but we had a congressman from

1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:46.560
 out west. I won't say where, but he prided himself on saying he was a retired cop. Yeah.

1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:55.040
 Busy cop. 22 years. He said no on the legislation. I witnessed a cop who was dying get out of his

1:35:55.040 --> 1:36:01.440
 wheelchair and said, Hey, brother, I got a half a million dollars in medical bills and I'm a

1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:07.120
 short timer. I got a few months to live. Who the F is going to pay him? Do the right thing. You

1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:12.560
 say you're a cop. You show me you're a cop and you sign that paper. And the guy started tearing

1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:16.960
 up the congressman and he signed it, but he had to be freaking shamed. And you know what he said?

1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:21.680
 Well, this doesn't really confront me. This is pork as far as my district is concerned. He goes,

1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:25.600
 Oh yeah. Do you know there's 10 guys from your district who came across the country to help

1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:31.680
 us that are also dying? He had no idea. He had no idea. And that's the sad part about Alex.

1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:39.440
 It's a failure in leadership. I mean, I think some people would vote for Mickey Mouse just

1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:42.960
 because if he ran, I mean, I know offense against Mickey Mouse. I'd like him. He's a good guy,

1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:52.160
 right? Allegedly. Allegedly, supposedly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But seriously, I look at some of

1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:57.680
 the leadership sometimes and go, We're in trouble. And also you lose, I think the way government is

1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:06.320
 structured is people who are senators or people who are in Congress, they start playing a game

1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:12.240
 between each other and they lose track of the connection to the people, to the basic humanity.

1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:18.080
 You forget, even when you think of yourself as a cop, you forget what are like the cops

1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:24.560
 and the other people servicing the community actually experiencing all the troubles they're

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:28.000
 going through and how they can actually be helped because you lose touch to that because you're

1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:31.840
 not actually living. You're not talking to them. You're not living among them. I mean,

1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:36.080
 that's a natural part of the system. But I think that's why character and great leadership is

1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:43.520
 important is you say you leave the game of Congress and you go back to the people. I mean,

1:37:43.520 --> 1:37:49.520
 that's what the country, you know, it's like the George Washington ideal is you're not playing

1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:54.480
 a game of power. You ultimately see yourself as somebody who's servicing this country's

1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:59.200
 service in the community and that requires talking to the people in their time of hardship.

1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:04.080
 Well, you have some people, some people serving in congressional districts don't even live in

1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:08.080
 that district. I mean, so how are they going to empathize? They're not even driving through there

1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:17.200
 on a daily basis. And, you know, again, when anything becomes lucrative from a financial

1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:24.240
 standpoint, it blurries people's vision. You have to take the potential of becoming rich out of

1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:31.760
 politics. Politics is public service. Police and fire and EMS are public service.

1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:41.280
 But cops and firemen and medics don't walk out of their career with gazillion dollar contracts

1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:45.280
 with this company and that company on that board of directors and this board of directors.

1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:50.960
 They walk out with a pension and that's it. And you have to wonder the intentions of people

1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:57.680
 getting into politics. Are they truly going into to help the human condition or are they

1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:02.640
 trying to help their own damn condition with their wallet and their pocketbook? I try to lean

1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:06.480
 toward the latter lately with what I'm seeing out there. Well, some of them are the good ones

1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:13.280
 and that's our job as a society is to elevate the good ones. That's it. And that has to do with

1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:21.200
 the ideals that we elevate. There are a number of conspiracy theories around the events of 9.11.

1:39:21.200 --> 1:39:28.080
 Do any of these hold true to you or do they just frustrate you, even anger you?

1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:38.400
 I've been asked this by a few different people in my life. This is my take on it, right? You're

1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:45.280
 a man of science and a man of education. So you. Allegedly. Allegedly, but yes, but you, you know,

1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:53.680
 you're a very, very intelligent man. And what I believe took place is this, structural steel

1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:02.640
 will fail at a sustained temperature of 1500 degrees Fahrenheit. And I don't know exactly how

1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:10.480
 long that would have to be sustained, but that's the temp, right? Diesel fuel, kerosene fuel,

1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:20.560
 kerosene based jet fuel, which was the ignition there burns at 2200 degrees Fahrenheit. So that

1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:26.400
 continued burning of that diesel, that jet fuel, but kerosene based, you know, it's all kind of

1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:33.600
 similar exceeded the temperature needed for that steel in the structural members of the

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:41.360
 Trade Center to fail. In my heart of hearts, I would hate to ever think that somebody

1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:49.920
 affiliated with our government with some sort of agenda would perpetrate that crime and that

1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:57.520
 tragic just destruction of humanity and property for some other form of gain.

1:40:57.520 --> 1:41:03.280
 Those planes were rammed into those buildings 450 miles an hour. They were loaded with thousands

1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:09.760
 and thousands of gallons of jet fuel. Number seven, Trade Center had the backup for the emergency

1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:17.520
 management system for the city. And it was an emergency generator in that complex, which had a

1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:27.360
 25,000 gallon tank of diesel fuel to continually run for weeks to keep the 911 system, the backup

1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:34.320
 system going in the case of a catastrophic event. Well, that tank in seven heated up

1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:39.760
 from the fire that was already going on from the aircraft debris coming into the building.

1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:48.240
 So once that diesel became ignited in seven, now you had enough temperature to fail that

1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:54.480
 steel in that building. So I would like to truly believe what I've learned from the minimal fire

1:41:54.480 --> 1:42:03.120
 science knowledge I have from my career, that it was just a matter of it burned too long, it burned

1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:10.160
 too long, it burned too hot, and it failed. I mean, if you look at the way it came down, it came down

1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:16.000
 as it was designed to in the God forbid event that it was to collapse, it came down pancaking

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:24.960
 upon itself. If it had failed horizontally and just sprayed out side to side, those buildings

1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:30.800
 would have dropped for a quarter, half a mile up to Canal Street. But you know, Lex, I can't...

1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:34.320
 And the destruction that could have resulted from that... Yeah, oh my gosh, it could have been so

1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:40.320
 much worse. I mean, you would have taken out every building from that point all the way up.

1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:45.120
 But in my heart, I'd like to just believe that it was just a fire that burned too long and too

1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:52.640
 hot. These planes caused structural damage upon impact in both buildings, and it was just a matter

1:42:52.640 --> 1:42:58.240
 of time. And then you think about it, you add all the plastics, all the carpeting, all of the stuff

1:42:58.240 --> 1:43:04.480
 that was burning on those floors, you add that to that fire load. I think it just had enough to

1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:11.440
 collapse it. And you were in building seven for part of that day? I was just after it came down

1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:17.200
 as well. We were aside it, and we weren't in it or next to it when it actually did come down.

1:43:17.840 --> 1:43:26.320
 But moments after we were there. And again, I would like to believe that it was just that

1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:32.880
 that fuel was going, and it just took its physics, took its course, and it failed.

1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:41.680
 So physics and science aside, it's both I would like to believe, and it's hard to imagine that

1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:47.440
 anybody would be so evil as to orchestrate parts of this from within the United States government.

1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:52.480
 That's very difficult for me to imagine. You know what though, there's people,

1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:58.640
 and I want to elaborate and won't get into it, any controversial subjects or what have you.

1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:04.160
 There's some people that don't have any problem at all perpetrating any level of evil.

1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:10.640
 People like you and I who have hearts and we have depth of soul, we couldn't imagine it,

1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:15.280
 but there's other people wouldn't even be a second thought. I mean, I've seen some horrific

1:44:15.280 --> 1:44:22.000
 incidents in my career that I go home shaking my head at night going, human beings are just,

1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:26.800
 they're not wired, right? You know, I mean, I look at animals, I love animals, I love dogs

1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:33.920
 especially, right? And I see this dog park when I train to fly airplanes now and something I wanted

1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:39.600
 to do. And there's a dog park across from the airport, and there's 60 dogs, and there's bones

1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:44.000
 flying up in the air and chew toys and sticks, and they're running around having the time of their

1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:49.680
 life, right? And they're all getting along, and they're not hurting each other, they're not violating

1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:55.760
 each other, they're not canceling each other. And I'm going, we really need to learn from these

1:44:55.760 --> 1:45:02.000
 dogs, right? And like, I just, yeah, I mean, sometimes it sounds crazy, but I think they're

1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:07.120
 better, they're better species than people. Unless they're rabid, they don't hurt on purpose,

1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:10.640
 they don't, you know, they don't cut you off in traffic and throw you the middle finger. And,

1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:17.760
 you know, just these, they just don't do these acts of humanity that sometimes are so vicious.

1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:23.760
 Why do you think these conspiracy theories, of which there's a lot, take hold?

1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:30.080
 Why do you think so many people believe some version of different conspiracy theories around

1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:36.480
 9 11? Well, you know, like many things in life, it leaves me a little conflicted. I have to say

1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:43.680
 this, I am at the point now, I don't know who to believe anymore. So I could see that lending a

1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:48.960
 hand to someone who's already a doubter going, Oh yeah, look, that's exactly that's what they're

1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:54.560
 doing. Right? I mean, you know, look at this whole virus, like, who do you believe? Like,

1:45:54.560 --> 1:45:59.600
 where to come from? You know, like, and, and, and, you know, if you plant that seed,

1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:05.200
 it's like that little campfire we were talking about earlier, right? You just toss a little gas

1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:10.400
 into those embers. You got to fire now. I also think there's a lot of people with a hell of a

1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:15.280
 lot of extra time on their hands, right? And it really bored, you know, the two are combined.

1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:19.120
 Alex, yeah, man, you know, like, look, I was a three job Charlie, right? You know,

1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:24.800
 one guy used to say to me or anything, but, but home, I go, No, I got deadlines, responsibilities.

1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:31.120
 You know, like that's, that's what it comes down to is like, I mean, look, we all, we all have our

1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:36.720
 hobbies and things we like and, you know, little nuances. And that's what makes us special. We're

1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:44.400
 unique. Every person is unique being, but I also think some people just, just, they want to cling

1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:50.800
 to something. Like we all want to feel accepted and belong to something. So all of a sudden you,

1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:54.880
 you group up with these people and you all believe this fervently like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know,

1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:59.920
 like they did it, they took it down, they took it down. And, and now you start going, yeah. And,

1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:03.840
 and I think what happens is when you're in company of people and you start telling each other the

1:47:03.840 --> 1:47:08.560
 same thing often, you freaking believe it. I mean, if you keep telling me, I got a great head of hair,

1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:12.800
 I'm going to go, you know what I do, but no, I don't. I mean, right? I got that waving bye bye

1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:17.920
 dude. But like, but you know, I think when you start hearing something often, you start believing

1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:21.840
 it, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to doubt their intelligence. I'm not going to doubt their

1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:29.840
 intentions, but I just don't see it as being plausible. I just, I, it would be too, too big

1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:35.840
 of an operation to, to, to successfully happen. I, you know, I mean, look, there's other things

1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:41.760
 that, you know, I won't say it on the interview there, but like I have my doubts with certain

1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:49.760
 things, you know, that, that. I mean, conspiracy theories take hold for a reason because some

1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:54.960
 of them are true. No, yeah. The hard thing is just to know which ones is the problem.

1:47:54.960 --> 1:47:59.760
 When you don't have facts, right? You don't know who to trust. Sometimes when you don't have facts,

1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:05.360
 when you don't have figures and you don't have science, it's hard to take someone's word on it.

1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:09.520
 You know, I had a conversation with someone a while back, right? And the guy's like,

1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:16.880
 just dedicated atheist and he thinks I'm an idiot for believing in God. And he's like,

1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:21.120
 you're one of those jerks who believes in creation. And I said, well, I do. Well,

1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:25.440
 what about the Big Bang Theory? He's going on this diatribe about the science and the

1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:29.440
 gases and the chemistry. And I'm going, dude, I barely got through high school chemistry.

1:48:29.440 --> 1:48:33.520
 Slow down. And he went on a tangent and all of a sudden I stopped. I went,

1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:40.880
 who, who created the gas and the molecules and the stuff you're talking about and the collisions?

1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:48.160
 And he was furious and stoned off. And I got him. And again, I had no facts. I had no figure.

1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:55.280
 He didn't either. But I stumped him. But sometimes when you can't show some, people need to see

1:48:55.280 --> 1:49:00.480
 something tangible. They need to see it in their hand to believe it. And that's, that's the real

1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:07.520
 hard thing about faith. I see it in action. People restore my faith. And I say to myself, well,

1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:11.760
 there can't be that many dummies in this world. If there's so many billions of us believing in

1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:18.880
 this higher power, this higher, right? And you said earlier, you believe most people are good.

1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:26.640
 And I do too. The bad outshine the good because the bad get the press. If it bleeds, it leads.

1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:32.480
 That's just, think about it. How many more damn zombie apocalypse movies can we make?

1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:37.200
 I didn't even know there was that many zombies. And it just seems like every other show is just

1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:41.440
 guys bashing each other's heads in with bats with nails in it. And it's like after a while,

1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:46.000
 it's like, oh, gosh, you got to get a new boogeyman here. You know, right? Like, but seriously, like...

1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:50.880
 But meanwhile, human civilization is getting better and better. We're just

1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:54.240
 like making Hollywood movies that just... We're getting better and better, but we're treating

1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:58.240
 each other worse and worse. You would think with all this technology and all the knowledge and all

1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:03.440
 the... It's like, what the hell is going on sometimes? I really want to see the good.

1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:09.360
 And I think maybe, maybe the level of bad that we're seeing was always existent. It's just now

1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:14.720
 everything is instantaneous news and flashes and tweets and this and this. Like, you know...

1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:20.080
 Well, with the technology we have, it's also come to the light. So you get to see all these

1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:25.840
 fights. It almost... I think that's step one of dealing with the problems, revealing it in its

1:50:25.840 --> 1:50:31.040
 full, beautiful light. Oh, yeah. How much of a bickering species we are. 50 years ago, a guy like

1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:35.520
 me who loves to talk, how the hell would I have gotten an opportunity to have someone listen to me

1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:40.960
 and have it, right? I love this. This is amazing. I think it's cool, but you didn't have that arena.

1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:46.080
 You didn't have all these things. My grandfather Nells, God rest him. He died in 1979. I mean,

1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:50.400
 that dude didn't even want to have a checking account. He would walk to each store, each the

1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:55.840
 phone company, the gas company, this company and pay the bill in person. He didn't trust the bank.

1:50:57.120 --> 1:51:02.400
 And it was like, he now ATMs this that he would be overwhelmed to be just like,

1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:08.640
 I mean, I love my dad, but to watch him on his iPad is comical, right? He calls my niece's boyfriend,

1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:13.280
 who's a tech guy, Matt, Matt, if you listen, he's the greatest. He'll have this poor guy in a form

1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:18.640
 for like hours. Like the second you're walking to see my father, my kids, hey, do me a favor,

1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:24.000
 he's straight out this bad. And it's comical because I'm looking at my dad. I'm going,

1:51:24.880 --> 1:51:30.320
 he was born when Hitler started World War II. Yeah. Wow. And I'm going, he's seen all of that.

1:51:30.320 --> 1:51:36.160
 Oh, my wife's grandmother was born in 1900 in Czechoslovakia and she died in 1998. I'm going,

1:51:36.800 --> 1:51:42.880
 holy, the stuff she saw in the span of her life, just, it's just incredible. But what troubles

1:51:42.880 --> 1:51:47.120
 me sometimes is with all of these advances and all these devices, this is what I say to my kids.

1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:58.000
 Look up from the phone and look up, right? Because we don't talk anymore. I saw a girl

1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:04.640
 literally, I shouldn't say girl, guy, whatever. I saw a person literally just about walking to an

1:52:04.640 --> 1:52:12.720
 open manhole covered texting. And I'm going, that's scary because your awareness is gone. And it's,

1:52:12.720 --> 1:52:18.880
 I've been at restaurants with groups of people and they're texting, they're texting each other to

1:52:18.880 --> 1:52:23.520
 sit on the other side of the table. I'm like, put the freaking thing down and have a conversation.

1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:28.080
 And that's the thing. We've lost the art of conversation. You know, like, like, you know,

1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:32.160
 my wife runs, she has just running jokes because there's a lot going on up there. And I'm like,

1:52:32.160 --> 1:52:36.640
 yeah, because I really, I'm inquisitive. I'm excited about life. I love to meet people. I love

1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:41.280
 to learn. And the only way you can do that is to have a conversation. The hilarious thing about

1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:45.840
 this. So you're obviously very charismatic. You got great stories. You're a great human being.

1:52:45.840 --> 1:52:49.680
 Thank you. And you're talking to a guy who spent most of his life behind a computer hiding from

1:52:49.680 --> 1:52:53.760
 people. No, no. But we're like trying to bridge this. Right. But I don't mean that as a rip,

1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:57.360
 but you, I would never know that. It's real. I would never know that because you're very engaging.

1:52:57.360 --> 1:53:02.400
 You're very like, I would not know, like you don't have any impediments to your

1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:08.000
 socially skills. You're personal. And that's, and again, I don't mean it as a knock to you.

1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:11.840
 Well, no, but this is me trying to look up from a smartphone is having these

1:53:11.840 --> 1:53:16.720
 conversations, talking to people. I think it's, it's important. I mean, some of it could be,

1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:21.840
 it's always hard to know. Some of it could be just you and I being old school,

1:53:22.800 --> 1:53:27.520
 because you grew up before the internet. Maybe there is joy and deep human connection to be

1:53:27.520 --> 1:53:32.480
 discovered inside the smartphone. We don't know, it doesn't seem that way. Because the smartphone

1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:38.560
 is so new, maybe we just haven't figured out those, those things, because there's a globalizing

1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:44.480
 aspect. There's a opportunity for you to connect with people from across the world in ways that

1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:49.840
 I have cousins in Ireland and England. I love it. I get a face time or what's happened. And

1:53:49.840 --> 1:53:54.000
 it's like, holy crap that they're, you know, three, 4,000 miles away and I'm having a conversation

1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:59.840
 now. I used to send my grandma in Ireland a letter. I adored her. She passed when I was,

1:53:59.840 --> 1:54:08.560
 was 10. And no, I'm sorry, I was 11. And I'd send her a letter, airmail, and, and, and I'd wait,

1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:14.400
 I'd wait. And about two weeks later, this, this airmail letter would come back and she called

1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:19.440
 me master Nils William Jordan. I would be so excited to open up that letter. Handwritten.

1:54:19.440 --> 1:54:24.560
 Yeah. And, and like, like, and then I'd write her another one and I just couldn't wait for letters

1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:31.440
 from Granny. And now it's like, you know, that's kind of faded away. Yeah. I still write letters,

1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:38.400
 by the way, handwritten. I do too. The way, the way this all came about was I, I wrote letters

1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:45.040
 to someone to say thank you for cancer research. I'm blessed to be alive. My cancer, right?

1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:49.200
 That's a good starting point for any story. I'm blessed to be alive. And my cancer was one

1:54:49.200 --> 1:54:56.400
 that if I got it 15 years prior to 19, excuse me, 2001, I was a dead man, right? 15, 20 years

1:54:56.400 --> 1:55:02.880
 before there was no drug to treat. I was gone, going home to see him. So there's this wonderful

1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:09.040
 gentleman that donated hundreds of millions of dollars to cancer research, Mr. David Koch.

1:55:09.040 --> 1:55:14.480
 He's since God rest his soul passed away. And he's a controversial guy, big time business titan.

1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:20.560
 And, and you know, there was, the press was just brutalizing him one day over some,

1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:26.560
 something to do with his politics. Now I'm a union guy. I'm proudly served in union,

1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:31.600
 still in a union, you know, and, and he was not, you know, most business guys don't like unions,

1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:37.040
 right? But you know, most guys like me don't like working for $3 an hour. So we like our unions,

1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:42.000
 right? And I reached out across the table, so to speak, and I sent him a hammer and letter

1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:47.200
 to thank him, to say, we may not agree on everything, but I can't thank you enough.

1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:51.600
 There's this regular dude out there who is now living his life, watching his kids grow.

1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:57.040
 Thanks to generous people like you who believe enough in cancer research, you've saved my life.

1:55:57.040 --> 1:56:02.400
 Maybe I can't see his exact dollars, but people like him. And he reached back out

1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:06.480
 and his secretary said, oh, he'd like to talk to you on the phone. I go, well, he's kind of a

1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:09.920
 busy guy. He wants to talk to me, the billionaire. And he got on the phone. He was like the greatest

1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:15.440
 guy in the world, invited me up to Sloan Kettering to dedicate a new cancer wing. It was like I was

1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:23.040
 hanging out with my dad. And, and the sweetest man, just so kind, so empathy, because he was a cancer

1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:31.600
 survivor. But now he's got the means to help people who've suffered his fate to a better place.

1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:37.040
 And he was so real. And it was so beautiful just to get to know, say, hey, you know what,

1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:43.120
 this guy is a big time guy, but yeah, he's just a regular human like you and I, you know, I'm a

1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:47.760
 guy who went to night college and I went to the army and I'm a blue collar kind of dude. And

1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:53.920
 here's this guy who went to MIT like you and he's a wildly successful billionaire, a genius. But

1:56:53.920 --> 1:57:00.640
 yet he can sit down and mix it up with me and know that I was truly grateful. And that to me was

1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:05.600
 just like one of the coolest little, you know, relationships I've ever had. It wasn't like we

1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:10.000
 were hanging out having barbecues together. But like, you know, it was just, I was so touched by

1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:17.760
 his decency. Well, the basics of the like cancer reveals, you know, it's like fundamental to the

1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:23.680
 human experience is trauma is tragedy. It's like money, who gives a shit about money, education,

1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:30.480
 all that is like, weird new inventions. You know, life is short, you suffer with the various

1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:36.080
 diseases. And that is a reminder that life is short and reminder of the basic human connection.

1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:40.320
 And that's why you can bridge that gap. Oh, yeah. All sparked by handwritten letter,

1:57:40.320 --> 1:57:44.960
 which just makes for a helpless story. And you know what, Lex? This is the commonality between

1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:51.680
 us. A guy with three jobs to a billionaire. We both had that sense of a sledgehammer to the chest.

1:57:51.680 --> 1:57:59.200
 Boom, you have cancer and you can't breathe for like 30 seconds. And then when your heart's just

1:57:59.200 --> 1:58:05.280
 about to kick off and you take a breath and you go, I'm sorry, would you say doc? You have cancer.

1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:11.360
 And it don't matter what kind. One of my, one of my best buddies, Bobby's going through right now,

1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:17.360
 prostate, and I got way too many of my buddies with cancer, right? My buddy Hugh became a vet

1:58:17.360 --> 1:58:21.600
 since his first cancer. He was a fireman. He's now veterinarian, right? He diagnosed me actually

1:58:21.600 --> 1:58:26.720
 over the phone, by the way. When they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. Well, Dr. Hugh,

1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:35.920
 he nailed it to the tee. And we talk. And the same thing that the dozen of my close friends that have

1:58:35.920 --> 1:58:43.360
 cancer, the same thing we say is the fear. So Mr. Koch and I, we shared that same sledgehammer to

1:58:43.360 --> 1:58:49.280
 the chest and that same fear. And it didn't matter how much money he had and how much I didn't.

1:58:49.280 --> 1:58:54.160
 And you know, it's just like the morning of the trade center. There was big time brokers

1:58:54.160 --> 1:59:00.000
 who went to their demise, right? Working in these firms. God rest them. And there was

1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:05.600
 dishwashers, excuse me, dishwashers up on the windows on the world restaurant on the 107th floor,

1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:11.440
 making five bucks an hour. And they died together. It didn't matter. It didn't matter if you had an

1:59:11.440 --> 1:59:17.440
 armored car loaded with bills, you were done that day. And that's, I think, where people need to

1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:23.360
 humanize each other. Just because you drive around in a nice car and you got your own jet and you

1:59:23.360 --> 1:59:28.720
 got this and you got that. Don't mean nothing. When you're going, when you're in that vulnerable

1:59:28.720 --> 1:59:36.240
 spot, you could have more money than the US reserves, Federal Reserve, or you could have

1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:43.040
 a welfare check. You're going. I learned that in a cancer ward. I had people on my ward that

1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:48.800
 died on me. I was going around as a little bit of an ambassador because I was trying to, I was

1:59:48.800 --> 1:59:55.200
 putting on a fake, I was putting on a fake like, I got this. I got this. I was so scared. But when I

1:59:55.200 --> 2:00:03.200
 got past that, that seven days of torture and the days leading up to it, I'd go around and try to

2:00:03.200 --> 2:00:08.080
 comfort the other cancer patients. I just went older, an African American gentleman. He couldn't

2:00:08.080 --> 2:00:12.640
 talk because he had such advanced throat cancer. He was my roommate for a little while, but then

2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:18.240
 he got worse. They had to put him by himself. And you couldn't understand what he was saying

2:00:18.240 --> 2:00:25.600
 because his throat was just so radiated from the radiation. But if you put your ear down to him,

2:00:25.600 --> 2:00:30.800
 you could make out what he was saying. And I'm not faulting the nurses for maybe not wanting

2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:37.440
 to do that. They're busy. They got a tongue going on. They can't spend. So if he was in need,

2:00:37.440 --> 2:00:44.640
 I'd put my ear down and I'd find out and I'd go get it for him. So when they moved me down the hall,

2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:56.080
 they asked me to come down with my IV tower. He needed me. And I knew it was bad because he just,

2:00:56.080 --> 2:01:06.880
 his look was gone. I said, sir, what do you need? And he whispered, call my sister. I'm going.

2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:13.760
 He had only one survivor in his whole life. And she was in North Carolina and he wanted her to know

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:20.800
 she couldn't get up. She was elderly. And I got the nurse and I got on the phone and I called

2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:29.200
 his sister and I said, ma'm, I explained who I was. And I said, he can't really verbalize too

2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:41.920
 well right now, but he wants to say he loves you. And I put the phone down and he told her he loved

2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:49.840
 her and he said, I'm going home. And that was it. And I hung the phone up and I said, ma'm,

2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:55.200
 I'm so sorry. I said, you know, they'll notify you and I stayed with him for a while holding his

2:01:55.200 --> 2:02:01.200
 hand and then, you know, they wanted him to rest and then I left and then I got the tap

2:02:01.200 --> 2:02:07.120
 an hour later and they said, I'm sorry he's gone. And then there was another girl and she was a

2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:14.000
 young girl from one of the areas I work, a young African American girl where I used to respond

2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:20.080
 that I didn't know her, but I knew her neighborhood and she had what I had, but they weren't sure

2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:24.720
 which one, you know, leukemias. There's an elusive beast. There's 49 of them, right? And each one

2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:30.720
 of them is like, got their own little nuances, their own specific treatments. So if they don't

2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:35.520
 know what you have, they don't know what to do for you. And she refused to let them drill into

2:02:35.520 --> 2:02:40.160
 her hip to take the marrow because it's vicious. It hurts so much. It's like someone's born into

2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:48.800
 your hip with a wood drill and it's no joke. And they asked me to try to convince her to let

2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:54.400
 them do that or she was going to die because if they couldn't figure it out, it was advancing

2:02:54.400 --> 2:03:02.880
 quickly. So I talked to her and she said, I can't, I'm too scared. I said, but are you more

2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:08.400
 scared to die? And she said, I am. I said, okay, I'll stay with you. I'll hold your hand. You

2:03:08.400 --> 2:03:13.680
 squeeze it as hard as you want. I said, if you want, they'll give you like a towel or something

2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:19.360
 to bite on or whatever. I said, but you get that pain out, but you need to do this so you can get

2:03:19.360 --> 2:03:26.080
 saved. And she said, okay. And they came in and they, this huge thick needle, they just bore it

2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:32.240
 into you and she's screaming for her life and she's squeezing my fingers so hard and so hard.

2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:36.480
 And I said, okay, hon, you keep going. You keep going. We got it. It's just 10 more seconds,

2:03:36.480 --> 2:03:43.520
 10 more seconds. They got it. They figured out her treatment and they got her on to her road

2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:56.080
 to recovery. And then I spent a long time asking God, why, why do I have cancer? Then I stopped

2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:03.360
 and I went, wait a minute. I didn't die that day with my friends. Shame on me for asking them

2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:13.680
 why I have cancer. I had 10 years after 9 11 with such great years. And I got to watch my little

2:04:13.680 --> 2:04:20.480
 girl being born when John never got to see his son. So it was all gravy after that. And I said,

2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:26.800
 but now I know why I have my cancer because I can, I can empathize with people who have it.

2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:35.360
 And I can try to be their voice when they can't talk, be their shield to try to take that pain

2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:38.480
 because I can understand, I can walk their walk.

2:04:41.360 --> 2:04:46.800
 And now I thank God for my cancer because it's made me a better human being. It's made me,

2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:51.280
 I'm not going to lie, it brought a lot of anger for a while and my family suffered it.

2:04:52.160 --> 2:04:58.480
 But I really tried to go past that and heal and part of living out in the country. It's very,

2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:06.160
 very healing for the mind and the soul. But I now thank God for the cancer because it humbled me.

2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:11.520
 I didn't really need humbling. I wasn't, I wasn't an arrogant puffed up type of person at all. But

2:05:11.520 --> 2:05:16.880
 you know, maybe I was running away at myself a little bit. I'm working on a TV show. I'm fine,

2:05:16.880 --> 2:05:22.480
 man. 30 at the time. Well, I was 42. I got sick. You know, life was cruising, man. It was great.

2:05:23.520 --> 2:05:28.320
 And then all of a sudden it was like a blowout on the highway in the middle of the night and

2:05:28.320 --> 2:05:34.320
 you were just veering off towards the guardrail. Yeah. You remembered, you reminded that you're

2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:40.800
 mortal and that's ultimately a connection to all the rest of us. Oh yeah. It's a good thing though

2:05:40.800 --> 2:05:44.000
 when you, you know, because that's a problem. I think there's a lot of people running around

2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:47.920
 and thinking they're immortal, right? You know, when you look at it, Lex, right? You look at the

2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:54.640
 heartache in a lot of segments of people. And anytime like someone that's got fame and wealth

2:05:54.640 --> 2:06:01.840
 and success and they die tragically, a lot of times it's from a substance abuse or just, you

2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:09.440
 know, just some horrible death. I used to say to myself, how the hell would someone with that

2:06:09.440 --> 2:06:14.880
 much money and that much fame and his freaking mansion and, you know, I love cars. My son and

2:06:14.880 --> 2:06:19.920
 I like just big car heads, you know, and I'm like, you know, this guy's got collection of cars and

2:06:19.920 --> 2:06:26.800
 he overdosed because he was sad. And I'm going, how the friggy you said, but then I stop and I go,

2:06:28.320 --> 2:06:33.120
 okay, because maybe he doesn't have any idea who loves him. He's got a lot of people clinging

2:06:33.120 --> 2:06:40.720
 on to him because of his success. And he just, he can't fill that void, you know? And then they

2:06:40.720 --> 2:06:46.720
 fill the void with something destructive. And I'm not bashing people that have substance abuse

2:06:46.720 --> 2:06:52.400
 problems or alcohol problems. I don't mean it that way. But what I mean is, it's just said

2:06:52.400 --> 2:06:59.280
 that their level of despair is so high. On the surface, they look like they just got everything

2:06:59.280 --> 2:07:03.120
 going on. It's all great, right? There's still humans, still guys dealing with the same. Yep,

2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:10.160
 exactly. Because they want love, right? They want love. And they can't, they can't really find it.

2:07:10.800 --> 2:07:14.560
 Well, first of all, that's true for all of us. I think we're deeply lonely and looking for love

2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:17.600
 when we find it. That's what friendship is. That's what friendship is. Absolutely.

2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:23.840
 And then that's true for whether you're super rich or super poor. It's all the same journey.

2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:28.720
 My dad said all the time, kid, you're going to end up working with hundreds of guys and, you know,

2:07:28.720 --> 2:07:32.880
 you'll love a lot of them. But he says, when it's all said and done and you're old like me,

2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:37.280
 and if you still got two or three of them that you talk to and you'll love. And I tell you what,

2:07:37.280 --> 2:07:43.920
 I mean, I have thanked the Lord more than two or three of them. And I have my six. I call it my

2:07:43.920 --> 2:07:48.240
 six. The six guys that are going to carry my coffin when I'm gone, right? Because I know this

2:07:48.240 --> 2:07:52.240
 cancer is going to come back. I know it. Like, we get multiples, right? My friend,

2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:57.200
 Nevet, just got his second. My friend, Mike said five of them. The other Mike is two.

2:07:58.640 --> 2:08:06.160
 But I wasn't ready to accept it in 2011. It was so much more to do. It was so much,

2:08:06.160 --> 2:08:10.160
 I was so scared. I'm like, wow, who's going to take care of my kids? And who, you know,

2:08:10.160 --> 2:08:14.640
 they were little things, you know, nine, 11 and 14, right? It's like, what the hell? I have two

2:08:14.640 --> 2:08:19.920
 girls and a boy between and they're beautiful kids. They're such good, good children. The adults now,

2:08:19.920 --> 2:08:25.200
 I mean, but, you know, they, my wife's a drill sergeant. She's tough. She don't mess, you know,

2:08:25.200 --> 2:08:29.920
 she's this big, but like. So you're the softie in the family. Well, you know,

2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:34.320
 it's funny because it might, my son said to me, my son's 21 now. He's a good kid, you know.

2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:41.360
 And he says to me back when he's like 12, he goes, dad, I don't want you to be offended,

2:08:41.360 --> 2:08:45.680
 but I'm really scared of mom. I'm not really that scared of you. And you know, like, I cracked up

2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:49.360
 because it's true that she's got to step, she's got to stand on like a milk crate to reach him.

2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:53.520
 Because, you know, she's tiny and he's tall, but it's true. But, you know, but she was hard

2:08:53.520 --> 2:09:02.160
 but fair, but loved. That's, see, this is the thing. You take any child, anywhere from any

2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:06.960
 background, if you love them, you nurture them, you teach them and you guide them,

2:09:06.960 --> 2:09:13.360
 you have a successful adult. And see, that's the problem in our society. It's not judgmental.

2:09:13.360 --> 2:09:21.360
 I'm not judging anyone. But we need to try harder as parents, as siblings, as friends.

2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:30.000
 But especially when we're blessed with a child, it's like, you got to put that child first. It's

2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:35.120
 like being a military person and a responder. It's not about you anymore. Now it's the team.

2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:42.320
 So that little child is now the team. And, you know, your wife or your significant other, you know,

2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:47.920
 you know, like it's not about you anymore. And see, that's the problem is people have a hard time

2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:55.280
 not making it about them. You know, like now it's really weird. My kids are 1921 and 24 and

2:09:55.280 --> 2:09:58.800
 they hardly want to hang with me because they're busy in their life. We love each other.

2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:03.600
 They're probably tired of hearing me go on and, you know, preach and whatever. But like,

2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:10.400
 but their adults, we did pretty much the crux of what we had to do to put them into adulthood.

2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:16.080
 And I look back and I go, wow, I wish I didn't work so much. And I wish, but then I say no,

2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:22.000
 but it was okay. My wife stayed home, good lessons, good, you know, just, just like.

2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:28.000
 But ultimately, like you said, it's love. It is. It's the common that love is

2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:34.640
 the most important ingredient on this earth. And that's the problem what's going on right now.

2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:39.920
 Like take politics out of it, right? Take polarizing each other against each other.

2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:45.680
 Take all that crap out of it and just airdrop a bunch of love, right? Like,

2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:51.200
 when I worked on Rescue Me, right? I love those people so much. They were such great,

2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:54.080
 we had such a great crew and they worked so hard. Your celebrity.

2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:58.880
 No, no, no, no, not at all. If I was, it didn't really, it didn't really work out so good. I

2:10:58.880 --> 2:11:04.560
 would went on to be in a stage hand that way. No, I'm not pretty, but they don't want old guys

2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:10.240
 with waving, waving by, by hairdos. But it was funny. The crew, we became really tight.

2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:17.520
 We had like shoot like 80, 90 people on a set, right? And, you know, the first few episodes,

2:11:17.520 --> 2:11:20.480
 everybody's trying to feel each other out because, you know, you work with different crews,

2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:26.160
 different people. And this is going back starting in 2004. It was a different time.

2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:35.440
 And I love to hug people because to me, a hug is a true expression of love and caring.

2:11:35.440 --> 2:11:38.640
 You may not know a person a long time, but you say, I care about you with a hug.

2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:44.800
 Can I add, can I add just a tiny tangent? This was in the midst of COVID when I was in Boston

2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:51.680
 and it was, you know, masks, like triple masks. And when I went to see Joe here,

2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:55.520
 when he was trying to convince me to move to Austin, Joe Rogan. And then the first time I

2:11:55.520 --> 2:12:00.560
 see him, he's like, ah, you motherfucking big ass hug. Yeah. And it felt so good.

2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:03.200
 People probably looked horrified. They're hugging. They're hugging.

2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:06.800
 Or it was just him. Oh, okay. I'm saying, but if you do it in public now, it's like,

2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:10.720
 it's like you committed a crime. But that expression, because I was so, you forget

2:12:11.680 --> 2:12:16.240
 how powerful that is. Oh, I got some of my buddies. I give them a huge,

2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:22.320
 huge hug and a big sloppy kiss on their cheek. And I, because I love them. These are my brothers,

2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:28.000
 you know? But on this set, I swear to God, it got to the point, and I'm not trying to whatever,

2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:32.080
 but there was people that would come up to me for the daily hug. Yeah. And I said,

2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:36.400
 what are you doing? And I said, come on, bring it in. And I give them the hug. And I said,

2:12:36.400 --> 2:12:40.800
 you don't understand. It just makes me feel so good. It makes me feel like you give a crap about

2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:46.640
 my side. I really do. I said, but it touched my heart that people were seeking me out to get

2:12:46.640 --> 2:12:50.960
 that hug to start the day. And I remember there was a guy in Manhattan, he was selling hugs for

2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:54.960
 like 50 cents. And I think he got arrested, right? It was just before COVID. But like,

2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:59.680
 I wouldn't sell them if, but now, well, now I got leukemia, I'd be kind of concerned to get into

2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:04.880
 COVID. I mean, but, but like, I, I really think we need that. We need hugging booths like in each

2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:10.480
 city or each town. Like, because there's so many people that just want to know if someone gives

2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:16.000
 a shit about them. And that's the problem. It's like, like, you know, that's what I love about

2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:21.360
 small little towns like where I am now in Tennessee. And I'm not knocking New York, I'm not knocking

2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:25.360
 big towns, but I guess it's easier to do in a smaller area because it's just not this massive

2:13:25.360 --> 2:13:30.720
 humanity. But they'll stop and check on you. Like you're out in the road and, you know, like,

2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:35.280
 I'm cutting and cleaning or whatever. Occasionally I'll roll a lawn mower or a tractor into a ditch

2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:40.640
 because I'm, you know, not a farmer too good, but it's easier to drive a fire truck in New York.

2:13:40.640 --> 2:13:45.440
 But they literally, oh, I was worried I haven't seen you. And I'm like, no, no, I'm okay. But they

2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:50.480
 literally like check on you. They're worried about you. And I'm going, people hardly know me, but

2:13:50.480 --> 2:13:58.240
 yet they're so caring. And, and that's the problem. Like this is what I love about my life. I spent

2:13:58.240 --> 2:14:03.600
 a lot of time as, especially as a young boy and a lot of time in Ireland at my grandma's farm.

2:14:04.560 --> 2:14:09.600
 And my mom comes from this tiny, tiny little village. She's out in the middle of nowhere.

2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:15.680
 And the, the child at home, she grew up and still my aunt and uncle live in it still. I just love

2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:21.040
 it there so much because everyone waves, Tennessee's similar. They wave driving by and they're like,

2:14:21.040 --> 2:14:24.480
 who the hell's that? I don't know, just wave, you know, but my cousin will point it out. Actually,

2:14:24.480 --> 2:14:28.640
 third cousin, second removed by, you know, Johnny, like, holy shoot, I'm related to everyone here.

2:14:28.640 --> 2:14:35.040
 Yeah. Right. But like, everyone stops to say hello and how are you? And I have a problem doing that

2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:39.920
 because my wife goes, people think you're crazy. Why are you talking to everybody? I said, like,

2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:44.400
 I'll literally stop someone and say, how's your day going? Like, I mean, I'll randomly on the

2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:48.640
 sidewalk, then it looks a little nuts. But like, if I'm buying a cup of coffee. Oh, that happens

2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:53.120
 here in Austin all the time. Yeah. That's why I love it here. Yeah. On the sidewalk randomly.

2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:57.120
 Yeah, no, it's just so nice. They'll say hi to me. I thought they recognized me or something.

2:14:57.120 --> 2:14:59.200
 Right. I don't give a shit who you are. They're just being nice.

2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:06.800
 Nice. I was on the road coming back, driving from my family up north down to Tennessee last week.

2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:15.920
 I stopped in a bathroom and it was closed. The girl was cleaning it, whatever. She's working

2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:19.200
 so hard, whatever. She goes, sir, she goes, if you go down the hall, there's a family restroom,

2:15:19.200 --> 2:15:24.960
 feel free to use it. You know, she didn't have to do that. And I went down and I'm old. You need a

2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:31.280
 bathroom. You need a bathroom, right? And I walked back out and I said, ma'm, I said, I want to thank

2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:36.480
 you for being here today. I says, bathroom was immaculate. It was, it was like my army bathroom

2:15:36.480 --> 2:15:42.240
 in the barracks. It was spotless, right? And I gave her $10. I said, I really like you to buy

2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:46.400
 lunch with me today. I said, you really didn't have to do me that favor. And she goes, no, sir,

2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:51.680
 I said, no, no, I said, I want, and she was like, I gave her a million bucks. And I say to my wife

2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:56.240
 now, I'm been praying to be a billionaire. She goes, that's a sin. I said, no, no, you don't

2:15:56.240 --> 2:16:00.480
 understand, right? She goes, oh, you're a mister, you know, a mister, you know, guy. I said, no,

2:16:00.480 --> 2:16:04.880
 no, no, I said, you're getting it wrong. I said, I'm praying to be like a multi gazillionaire

2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:10.320
 because I want to give it all away. We used to have a sign in ladder 114 until some other rival

2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:14.160
 truck company stole it, right? Because that's what we do. You know, you get sent to cover your

2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:18.640
 district when you're out of fire and now your stuff's missing. And the old timers had a sign that

2:16:18.640 --> 2:16:25.760
 says, I am content because if you got to ladder 114, that was considered such a great place,

2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:30.800
 such a great assignment, such great guys, you had to be vetted to get there. You couldn't just

2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:37.200
 randomly go. And it was a little exclusionary, but they wanted good guys. And I said to myself,

2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:43.760
 that's where I am in life right now. I am content, but I'm restless because I want to really do a

2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:50.560
 lot more good. It's like this podcast. I want to make sure that it's not forgotten. And I want to

2:16:50.560 --> 2:16:55.920
 make sure that these charities that are really, really helping people get recognized. But I'd

2:16:55.920 --> 2:17:01.280
 like to take it a step further, right? A friend of mine runs this foundation for young folks

2:17:01.840 --> 2:17:08.640
 suffering mental illness and in crisis. It's for someone that we love dearly. And

2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:18.560
 he's on a mission now to get therapy dogs for really, really mentally wounded warriors, right?

2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:24.960
 There's a lot of these young soldiers are having a really hard time. And now they could be out a

2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:30.160
 while. They may have come back in country two, three years ago. Now it's just starting to set in.

2:17:31.360 --> 2:17:38.160
 And there's a waiting list for thousands of therapy dogs. And he said that they can't get

2:17:38.160 --> 2:17:42.720
 enough of them quick enough. But he said, when you see the response to the way these

2:17:43.840 --> 2:17:48.880
 veterans just light up when they get these dogs, it just changes their life radically,

2:17:48.880 --> 2:17:56.240
 immediately. And I said, that's it. God, I don't know how I'm going to do it. But I want to be a

2:17:56.240 --> 2:18:01.600
 gazillionaire. And I don't want any picture, photo ops, this, that. I just want to go,

2:18:01.600 --> 2:18:05.920
 there's a dog, there's a dog, there's a dog, there's a dog. And then I want to build veterans land

2:18:05.920 --> 2:18:11.200
 for these, these vets who just need a nice clean place to live. So why don't we take these old

2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:16.640
 army bases and marine bases and Navy bases that have been shut down. They're just sitting there

2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:23.520
 rotting away. I was in the army in Alabama. My old for McClellan is three quarters vacant. It's

2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:27.040
 sitting there. They just did a documentary on it. It just looks like zombie land to go back to

2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:33.600
 zombies. So why don't we take that and renovate it and say to vets who are struggling, Hey guys,

2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:40.800
 you're going to live here. And they take the old army, you know, the places where they had all the

2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:45.920
 supplies or, you know, there's massive buildings where you could just retrofit it and make light

2:18:45.920 --> 2:18:52.080
 manufacturing within two weeks. Give these guys jobs. They live, they work, they'll take care of it.

2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:57.200
 Military guys, they teach you how to take care of stuff, right? How the hell in this country should

2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:03.600
 any vet come back home and be homeless? Because now they, now after dedicating their lives for six,

2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:10.320
 seven, 10, 12 years, five, five, six deployments making 750 an hour. And then, you know, they spend

2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:15.760
 seven years or they get a whopping 16 an hour, right? You know, they walk out making 35 grand.

2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:22.080
 And now no one gives them a job. No one gives them a chance. So very quickly they end up homeless

2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:29.920
 by no fault in their own. And I don't know how that's even possible. The people in this country

2:19:29.920 --> 2:19:36.400
 who've given the very most and they're struggling, they're hurting. That's not fair. And my whole

2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:43.280
 thing is, if I can have this dream of succeeding, so to speak, I want to try, I want to try to change

2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:47.200
 it, you know, and just, just, so that's why I'm praying to be a billionaire.

2:19:47.200 --> 2:19:53.360
 A billionaire. My Irish mother probably wouldn't agree either because you're not supposed to,

2:19:53.360 --> 2:19:58.880
 right? Well, I'm the same with you. The more, the more money you have, the more you're able to help

2:19:59.920 --> 2:20:07.040
 help people. You can put smiles on people's faces. I have to ask you, the U.S. invaded Afghanistan

2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:14.720
 in October 2001 in response to terror attacks. Now 20 years later, we still had a presence and

2:20:14.720 --> 2:20:20.560
 abruptly withdrew all troops. What do you think about this war across the world that

2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:26.800
 was sparked by this tragedy? Whenever you do something quickly without thinking it out,

2:20:26.800 --> 2:20:33.120
 thinking it through and planning, it doesn't succeed. I understand that we needed to exit.

2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:39.520
 I mean, how, how long are we going to stay over there? And we've lost over 7,000 of our young

2:20:39.520 --> 2:20:46.160
 souls over there. For sometimes people, I don't know if they're grateful for it or not, right?

2:20:46.160 --> 2:20:52.080
 I mean, I don't know. So there's the other element, I'm sorry to interrupt. One is the

2:20:52.080 --> 2:21:00.240
 financial of $6 trillion. And that money is not just money. It's, it's education. It's everything.

2:21:01.920 --> 2:21:06.320
 It's money that could have gone towards first of all, the first responders. But all the

2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:11.840
 servicemen and women of all kinds throughout this country. And then there's the other side,

2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:19.120
 which is the over 800,000 people who died in direct result of this conflict. So not just the

2:21:19.120 --> 2:21:25.040
 American side of the troops, but just people who died, those humans. And those humans,

2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:35.360
 many of them civilians, that's spreading hate, especially if you have leaders on the other

2:21:35.360 --> 2:21:40.800
 side who frame the death of those civilians in certain ways that just spreads hate throughout

2:21:40.800 --> 2:21:48.720
 the world. And so you think about this kind of 20 year saga and think, what are the ways that money

2:21:48.720 --> 2:21:55.120
 could have spent, be spent better? And what was the way that we could have spread more love in the

2:21:55.120 --> 2:22:04.320
 world versus hate? And you wonder. But then the other side, what is it? I'm not sure who says this

2:22:04.320 --> 2:22:11.840
 line, but it's something like, we sleep at night because there's a rough men out there ready to

2:22:12.720 --> 2:22:19.120
 fight for you. There is some sense in which we have to make sure that there's strength

2:22:19.120 --> 2:22:28.640
 coupled with the love, right? Otherwise, evil men will do evil onto the world. So it's a very

2:22:28.640 --> 2:22:33.760
 difficult decision. But then you look at the final picture. It's like, what have we gotten for this

2:22:33.760 --> 2:22:39.600
 six trillion dollars? What have we gotten for this 20 years? The thousands of Americans,

2:22:39.600 --> 2:22:45.520
 soldiers who died, the hundreds of thousands of civilians who have died.

2:22:49.120 --> 2:22:54.960
 You know, it's a troubling subject for me. I'm a patriot. I love this country.

2:22:55.600 --> 2:23:03.360
 I love it when my soul. And I was just about to head over to the first Iraqi war. And we went

2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:08.640
 out for desert warfare training and then it ended. I was at that time a combat medic assigned to an

2:23:08.640 --> 2:23:13.680
 armored cavalry unit. So basically tanks driving around an armored personnel carrier. When it gets

2:23:13.680 --> 2:23:21.280
 hit, then you tend to that guy, try to save his life. I didn't want to go. I may sound like a

2:23:21.280 --> 2:23:27.680
 coward. I did not want to go to war. I would have went willingly if I was sent to defend my country.

2:23:27.680 --> 2:23:37.440
 I took my oath. I didn't join the military to kill. But if necessary, I would use the analogy of

2:23:37.440 --> 2:23:43.840
 cancer. If you have a cancer and you're aware of its presence and you don't annihilate those cells

2:23:44.880 --> 2:23:49.520
 and take them out quickly, it's going to spread and it's going to kill you.

2:23:51.360 --> 2:23:57.120
 Those evil bastards that flew those airplanes, one of those airplanes had a little three year old

2:23:57.120 --> 2:24:02.960
 child in it from Ireland, where my mom's hometown. A friend of mine who since died of a heart attack

2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:09.520
 from 911 toxins, he found her shoe with human remains in it. And he thought someone was messing

2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:12.800
 with us because we didn't know there was any kids in the building. He says, boss, there's

2:24:14.320 --> 2:24:18.240
 a baby shoe and it looks like there's something in it. But there's no kids in the trade center.

2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:24.800
 I went, the plane, it's a little girl's shoe. I can never get that shoe out of my mind.

2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:32.160
 The evil bastards who perpetrated that needed to have missiles strike and rain down upon them

2:24:32.160 --> 2:24:38.320
 and annihilate them like a cancer that they are. What just fascinates me is they'll show videos

2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:42.240
 of these guys flying around and pick up trucks with 50 cows on the back. It's like, well,

2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:48.240
 wait a minute, if a camera crew can get this footage, you think all these freaking drones and

2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:57.760
 planes and radar assisted systems can't just go, good night, you're gone. So kill the cancer,

2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:03.600
 kill the cells, get rid of it, get rid of it quickly and go into remission.

2:25:03.600 --> 2:25:11.920
 Like an undeniable show of force that sends a message that gets rid of most of the

2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:18.160
 obvious centers of terrorism. And that note, that's though, because we offline mentioned

2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:25.680
 a discussion with Jaco and maybe a romanticized view and mentioning brothers in arms by

2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:31.280
 diastrates and saying, we're all brothers in arms, even when it's on the opposite side of

2:25:31.280 --> 2:25:37.120
 fighting, which is more of a vision and growing up in the Soviet Union, you saw about World War

2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:45.600
 II, that it's all just kids thrown into the kids sent to die in all sides. But then presenting

2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:57.920
 that to Jaco, who was in Iraq, he did not see as brothers in arms, which is there's his basic

2:25:57.920 --> 2:26:04.560
 statement is there's evil people and some people don't deserve the compassion. You give them a few

2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:09.760
 chances, they don't take the chances they have to go because they're spreading evil onto the world.

2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:18.080
 And so we're not, all of us deserve a chance. But the difference though, and believe me, I

2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:24.640
 Jaco, I am from a way, way minor league compared to him. I mean, this man was right there in the

2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:29.600
 firing line, but I can understand his analogy because when you think about it, those young

2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:34.000
 conscripts back in Germany and Russia and all the countries where they were being drafted,

2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:40.880
 even our guys were being drafted and thrown into this. They were, they were gallantly and and

2:26:40.880 --> 2:26:48.080
 bravely defending their country. Now, I'm sure the young Germans felt, well, hey, Hitler must be

2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:53.040
 right. Right. And young Russians felt, hey, Stalin must be right. And, you know, the young

2:26:53.760 --> 2:27:00.560
 Americans fear, hey, President Roosevelt must be right. So they were romantically, in a sense,

2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:06.560
 defending the honor of their country, of their motherland. The difference between those, so

2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:11.760
 they did have that commonality. If you and I were firing across each other from France to Germany,

2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:16.960
 or, you know, from Germany to Russia or whatever, which is these two kids who got thrown into this,

2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:23.680
 we didn't freaking ask for this. Right. But the difference with Jaco's enemy is no one was attacking

2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:29.520
 their country over there. Right. No one was taking their country over, maybe in their mind,

2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:33.680
 did they didn't want people trying to build their government this and that. I don't, I don't know,

2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:39.760
 I don't know enough about the history there to really elaborate. We didn't attack them.

2:27:41.520 --> 2:27:47.200
 And if a soldier attacks a soldier, that's an understood concept amongst warriors.

2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:52.160
 But when a soldier attacks a civilian, now you're after a different beast. And you've

2:27:52.160 --> 2:27:56.960
 written that beast off, if that makes any sense. Yeah. And the enemy, I mean,

2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:05.680
 as Jaco explains, the enemy in Iraq and just certain parts of the Middle East is essentially

2:28:06.320 --> 2:28:12.320
 terrorists who are, who don't value the lives of the civilians of their own country. They don't.

2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:19.360
 And so it becomes like this weird guerrilla warfare slash game of violence that ultimately

2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:24.640
 allows them to gain more power within their country, but they don't care if they're playing

2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:32.800
 with civilian lives as pawns. If you have a child who dies on there, on that's a civilian in their

2:28:32.800 --> 2:28:38.000
 country, that could be seen as a positive for them because they can use that to leverage for

2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:43.200
 more and more power within that country. So when you're fighting an enemy like that,

2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:48.720
 that's a vicious, that's an evil enemy. Absolutely. It's like snakes are beautiful,

2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:52.560
 but if you go pet a rattler, you're getting bit and you're getting dead, right? Yeah.

2:28:52.560 --> 2:28:57.200
 And that's what terrorists, you've got to cut the head of the snake off. And I feel, no,

2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:01.760
 don't commit our guys to me there anymore. But what we need to do is go with tech warfare.

2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:07.360
 If we have intel from drones or planes or whatever it is that so and so and so and so and so and so

2:29:07.360 --> 2:29:12.160
 are driving down in that pickup or whatever, take it out and do it again tomorrow and tomorrow

2:29:12.160 --> 2:29:16.480
 and tomorrow. And maybe they'll get, they'll get the message after a while. Oh shit, these guys

2:29:16.480 --> 2:29:21.920
 aren't messing around. Instead of throwing wave after wave of our brave warriors, brave seals,

2:29:21.920 --> 2:29:26.960
 brave, you know, special ops guys. And God bless them for what they do. I couldn't do it.

2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:35.120
 I could not have done it, but they have to be now sitting home going. What the hell?

2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:43.120
 My friends, my body, myself, like they must feel so betrayed because they passionately went over

2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:51.440
 there to cure a cancer, the cancer of terrorism. And now the cancer is back. And I hate to say it,

2:29:51.440 --> 2:29:56.160
 but I think the cancer might start running wild. We need to change our tactics up. This is just

2:29:56.160 --> 2:30:04.400
 my opinion. I can't see committing all of our guys to a continuous eternal war. But I think

2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:11.600
 what we need to do is hit surgically and hit hard at that cancer that is over there. We are never

2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:17.520
 going to rebuild that region. It's just, it's thousands of years of traditions that you're

2:30:17.520 --> 2:30:23.200
 not going to change. It's just some people are unchangeable because they don't want to.

2:30:24.400 --> 2:30:29.440
 And we have so many social problems here in our country, I think that we need to fix first.

2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:36.240
 I heard this spoken in the past by many people. It's like the garden theory. You have your garden

2:30:36.240 --> 2:30:41.120
 with a fence around it. You tend to your garden. There may be weeds on the outside of the fence,

2:30:41.120 --> 2:30:47.120
 but as long as they're not inside your garden, your garden will prosper. And I know some people

2:30:47.120 --> 2:30:52.640
 don't agree to that America first and the whole take care of our own. But it's like,

2:30:53.680 --> 2:31:00.320
 how are we going to take in more people now? And I have a human feeling for them,

2:31:01.280 --> 2:31:06.000
 but it's almost like the lifeboat theory. How many people can we take into the lifeboat before

2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:13.600
 the lifeboat itself sinks as the ship is going now? So if we can't take care of our own homeless vets

2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:21.680
 and our own homeless people, and it's just going to become worse. And it doesn't make any sense.

2:31:21.680 --> 2:31:29.680
 It's just like we need to just take a time out and I think switch our tactics a little bit.

2:31:29.680 --> 2:31:36.480
 And invest into helping people here at home. Absolutely. There's very few

2:31:36.480 --> 2:31:45.760
 as obvious of cases as the first responders in 9.11. One of the things that I really want to

2:31:45.760 --> 2:31:51.280
 kind of talk about at least a little bit, we've already talked about the amazing project that

2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:58.560
 you're doing, the 20 for 20 podcast that you host. We mentioned one story, Stephen Siller.

2:31:59.200 --> 2:32:04.320
 Is there other stories or maybe you can speak out at a high level? What are you hoping to tell?

2:32:04.320 --> 2:32:10.800
 And all these different stories that are weaved about that connect the

2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:18.320
 tragedies and the triumphs, the heroism of that day and the days and the years that followed.

2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:25.840
 You know, Lex, it seems like the common few themes, the common threads are being selfless,

2:32:26.880 --> 2:32:29.520
 helping out others even though they might be a stranger.

2:32:29.520 --> 2:32:37.280
 In acts of kindness, acts of love, and it seems to all be weaved together with faith,

2:32:37.280 --> 2:32:42.960
 they all seem to have some sort of faith. I mean, we have one gentleman, Mark Hanna,

2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:49.520
 and he's a Coptic Egyptian priest. And he's an immigrant to the United States. He was a

2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:55.040
 poor authority building engineer. And with his crew who subsequently passed away,

2:32:55.040 --> 2:33:01.280
 the crew did. He was effectively rescuing dozens of people on the upper floors. And his boss ordered

2:33:01.280 --> 2:33:08.320
 him to assist an elderly gentleman who was 89 down 78 flights of stairs to get him out.

2:33:08.320 --> 2:33:14.000
 And in stopping on the 21st floor, he figured they would just wait there for medics. He came

2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:19.760
 across Captain Patty Brown of latter company three, who told him, no, sir, you need to evacuate.

2:33:19.760 --> 2:33:24.640
 And Captain Brown picked his brain a little bit about the structure because he figured,

2:33:24.640 --> 2:33:30.000
 found out he was an engineer. Captain Patty Brown continued on to

2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:36.960
 defect rescues, and he and his crew were killed. But father, he's now, Mark was able to effectively

2:33:36.960 --> 2:33:41.840
 evacuate this gentleman. They were the two known last survivors to come out of the tower.

2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:47.680
 He now has dedicated his life to becoming a Coptic priest in St. Mary's Church in

2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:52.640
 East Brunswick, New Jersey. He did this for a total stranger. And he said he was inspired

2:33:52.640 --> 2:34:00.320
 by his bosses who died and his friends. One of his best friends was an Italian man. The other man

2:34:00.320 --> 2:34:06.320
 was a retired Navy SEAL Hispanic man. And they were part of this melting pot. And no one looked

2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:10.240
 at each other that day. What color, what race, what belief are you? They just said, hey, you're a

2:34:10.240 --> 2:34:17.440
 human in need. Let's go. And we have the story about John Field on his mission to

2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:24.320
 help the responders. We have a young lady, Mariah, whose birth father was on Flight 93.

2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:29.120
 She had not even met him. And she had this premonition that somebody in her family was killed

2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:35.600
 that day. And her adopted mom said, no, everyone's fine. Three years later, when she was legally

2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:40.480
 able to find out who her dad was, she found out that her dad, Tom, was actually on that plane

2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:47.440
 as part of the Let's Roll team. And we have a gentleman, Robert Burke, who's an actor,

2:34:48.240 --> 2:34:53.680
 sweetheart of a man. He's a gentleman. And he's a very, very popular actor in Hollywood. He was

2:34:53.680 --> 2:35:00.000
 on Rescue Me, Blue Bloods, Gossip Girls. And Bobby, my friend, as I call him, is a volunteer

2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:04.480
 fireman now. This man doesn't need to get out of bed at two o clock in the morning and help people

2:35:04.480 --> 2:35:09.600
 with a stroke or a burning garage or a burning house. But he does because he wants to. Because

2:35:09.600 --> 2:35:14.400
 his best friend was Captain Patty Brown. And his other best friend was Father Michael Judge,

2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:20.880
 who was our chaplain, who was killed literally blessing victims at the site, had just given

2:35:20.880 --> 2:35:25.840
 last rights to the firefighter I mentioned earlier, Danny, who was killed. And Father Judge was in the

2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:31.040
 lobby of the building giving a blessing, praying to God to please stop this. And he was struck by

2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:37.760
 debris and he was killed. And Bobby goes on to elaborate about Father Judge's story. Father

2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:42.000
 Judge used to walk the streets of New York City helping AIDS patients just with whatever they

2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:48.320
 needed. And he was a Franciscan friar. They wear sandals and a rope. They're just, they just live

2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:56.800
 very humble lives of, and it's just a common denominator is loving each other and helping

2:35:56.800 --> 2:36:01.760
 each other, regardless if you know the person or not. And really, when you think about it,

2:36:01.760 --> 2:36:09.200
 that's how America was made. We fought for independence. Stranger fought next to stranger

2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:16.640
 and fought tyranny because they wanted freedom. They wanted to be able to live, love,

2:36:17.840 --> 2:36:23.920
 pray, and prosper. And they fought and died alongside of strangers. And it's sort of symbolic

2:36:23.920 --> 2:36:28.720
 of what happened that day. And then strangers from around this great country just flocked in

2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:34.400
 and by the thousands to help. They didn't know who was in that pile, but they didn't care. That

2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:40.160
 was another American. And what I ultimately am trying to do involved in this beautiful project

2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:50.720
 is spread the message of doing the right thing. Look at these examples, these brave people who

2:36:50.720 --> 2:36:55.920
 didn't have to, especially the civilians, they weren't paid to run back in there and help person

2:36:55.920 --> 2:37:00.880
 after person. And they had no obligation. They could have just said, hey, man, I'm out of here

2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:08.720
 and just bolted, but they didn't. So we're just trying to say to people, let's bring back that

2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:14.960
 unity and that feeling of 912. As strange as 912 of a day it was, it was so sad because

2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:22.400
 it was the first dawn of the sun where we realized this wasn't a dream, this was real,

2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:27.840
 and it's not going away. But the beauty of it was there was thousands of people lined up along

2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:34.480
 the West Side Highway with signs and American flags. And they were from every country and every

2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:41.040
 race and every creed. And it didn't matter who they were, but they all shared one bond, love.

2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:50.400
 And they were hugging and crying and thanking rescuers. And it brought the morale so high

2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:56.400
 for a group of people that was so beaten down the day before. It just started lifting

2:37:56.400 --> 2:38:02.560
 the morale and making us realize, you know what, people really do give a crap. They really do love

2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:07.200
 each other. And now I want to be honest with you, I've been doubting that a little bit lately.

2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:12.560
 I still have these examples of it, you know, that lady who helped me last night with the phone and

2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:16.880
 just, you know, I know there's these shining little examples, but sometimes I think,

2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:23.680
 I don't know, are we running out of them? Well, I got to give you some advice. So there's two

2:38:23.680 --> 2:38:30.000
 words that were repeated often in the days and the years after 9 and 11, which is never forget.

2:38:30.560 --> 2:38:38.640
 So it might remind you to never forget about 9 and 12. I mean, those words you talked about that,

2:38:38.640 --> 2:38:44.000
 you know, there's people, what is it, college freshmen. Yeah, they weren't even born.

2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:48.400
 They weren't even born. And there's people in the 20s that were too young to remember,

2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:53.680
 to understand the events of that day. But I think what that day as you're describing means,

2:38:53.680 --> 2:38:57.680
 it's not about a terrorist attack, it's about the unity that followed.

2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:02.400
 It was tremendous, Lex. I never felt so proud. I was always proud of this country.

2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:06.480
 You know, I remember my grandparents used to walk by, I'd see a flag, I'd go here to

2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:10.160
 Star Spangled Banner and he'd tear up. And I'd say, Grant, why are you crying? He said,

2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:16.240
 I'm not crying. His tears of joy. I love this country so much. And I just remembered like

2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:22.400
 feeling that way. I felt that way 9, 10. I felt that way on 9, 11. But then on 9, 12,

2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:28.160
 I was just so proud of just the people, the way they stepped up. And I just want to try to see

2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:33.120
 if that can happen again. And I hope it's not necessary for us to have another tragedy to

2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:38.560
 bring that about. Let's do that without the tragedy. Let's just stop and say, Hey,

2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:45.280
 you know what? Let me listen to what this guy has to say. And maybe he probably won't convince me,

2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:50.880
 but maybe I'll go, well, you know, I never thought of it that way. Stop the finger pointing,

2:39:50.880 --> 2:39:56.480
 the bickering, the tantrums, the fighting. It's just not necessary. You get you nowhere.

2:39:56.480 --> 2:39:59.920
 Right? It's like, you know, I was two years old and I stomped around because I wanted to

2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:04.480
 cook you a piece of candy. I still didn't get it, right? You know, turn blue in the face and

2:40:04.480 --> 2:40:08.880
 whatever got a swat in the rear end, but it didn't get the candy. And that's what we got going on

2:40:08.880 --> 2:40:15.120
 right now. Everybody's just stomping around being a baby. Stop, just stop. We're really lucky. Look,

2:40:15.120 --> 2:40:21.360
 the country's not perfect, right? You know, but it's damn good. It gives us all these opportunities.

2:40:21.360 --> 2:40:26.320
 You know, like I said, no one's rushing out the gates to get out of here. They're freaking,

2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:31.440
 I got a cousin of mine. I love them dearly, my cousin Tony in Ireland. And he said, he's just

2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:36.240
 a little older than me. He's in his fifties. He said, man, I should have done it. I should have

2:40:36.240 --> 2:40:41.360
 went to America. My dad said, go to America. I went to England. And he went back to Ireland.

2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:45.520
 And you know, he, but he's happy in Ireland. It's just home. But he said, wow, what a place

2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:50.400
 of opportunity. And I said, it's never too late. He goes, yeah, but you know what, you get tied

2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:56.960
 down. And I understand that. I thank God my mom came here at 16. I thank God my grandpa got on

2:40:56.960 --> 2:41:03.520
 that ship. And it's 20, 27, I think, you know, and not a nickel to rub together. I thank God

2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:08.000
 they did it. Cause I don't know where else I would have ended up. There's no place else I want to be.

2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:15.200
 And I thank God that there's people like you who rushed towards ground zero to help other human

2:41:15.200 --> 2:41:21.200
 beings. And I believe that, that, that human spirit is ultimately represents the bestest

2:41:21.200 --> 2:41:26.480
 country in the best of this world. Thank you for the stories you're telling for your perseverance

2:41:26.480 --> 2:41:33.280
 in that. And thank you for welcoming me to the crew. You're very welcome. I'm proud. I'll take

2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:37.680
 you any day. You look like you could do the job just fine. I love lifting heavy things and doing

2:41:37.680 --> 2:41:44.080
 dangerous things. So I'm proud to be part, part of this country and part of the Ditalio now. Well,

2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:48.080
 you are, you are definitely an attribute to America. And we're glad you chose to come here.

2:41:48.640 --> 2:41:53.040
 You know, like it's, it's such a beautiful place. It's a beautiful melting pot. You know,

2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:56.880
 if we were all the same, it would be kind of a boring place, right? Kind of boring. It really

2:41:56.880 --> 2:42:01.200
 would, but it just, it's just such a great place. And I just want to say thanks. It's an honor.

2:42:01.920 --> 2:42:07.040
 It's an honor to have someone to let me sound off and, and it'll be even bigger honor if somebody

2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:11.520
 will listen to me and just say, Hey, you know, let me just try to do something good today. And

2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:16.880
 you know, that's, that's the tunnel to towers mantra is let us do good. And I just, you know,

2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:26.400
 I, I got a really big credit card with God, a big balance, right? I need to pay him back a lot and

2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:31.680
 I need to pay him forward. And I'm just going to spend the rest of my days trying my best. I don't

2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:36.960
 know where this is going to go, what it'll lead into, but I really would like to get those dogs

2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:42.000
 with those vets and build them that village and just keep going on from project to project to just

2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:49.360
 say when my final day comes and I'm laying there and I say, you know what, I really made the most

2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:55.040
 of that second chance God gave me way back in 2011. I mean, I hope it's 30, 40 years from now, but

2:42:55.040 --> 2:43:01.120
 even if it's 30 months from now, I've given it the best shot. So thank you, sir. I appreciate it

2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:06.480
 and wishing you blessings and success in your career. Keep up the good fight and you're always

2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:14.720
 welcome back to Texas. Well, I love it. It's great food and a little hot. Come on. We don't do so

2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:18.880
 good to Irish in the sun, you know, but. Well, the barbecue and the people are worth it.

2:43:18.880 --> 2:43:24.080
 No, they are. They're awesome. I was down here for some storm relief a few years ago. And I tell

2:43:24.080 --> 2:43:28.400
 you what, I fell in love with it. The people are great. It's a great state. And yeah, I'll

2:43:28.400 --> 2:43:32.480
 definitely, definitely be back again for sure. Thanks for talking to Daniel. Thank you, sir.

2:43:32.480 --> 2:43:37.680

2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:49.520
 some words from Franklin D. Roosevelt. Human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened

2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:57.760
 the fiber of a free people. A nation does not have to be cruel to be tough. Thank you for listening.

2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:07.760
 I hope to see you next time.
