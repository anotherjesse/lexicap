00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
 The following is a conversation with Roger Reeves, one of the most prolific drug smugglers in history.

00:06.240 --> 00:12.400
 He worked for Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa, the leaders behind the Medellin Cartel.

00:13.280 --> 00:19.200
 Roger was the employer and close friend of Barry Seal, the infamous drug smuggler who was the

00:19.200 --> 00:26.160
 main character in the movie American Made. Roger transported countless tons of cocaine and marijuana

00:26.160 --> 00:32.320
 covering six continents. He escaped prison five times, was shut down in both Mexico and Colombia,

00:32.320 --> 00:39.360
 and was tortured, nearly to death in a Mexican prison. Through all of this, his wife Mari,

00:39.360 --> 00:44.400
 the love of his life, was there with him, and when he was in prison, she waited for him.

00:45.040 --> 00:49.840
 He recently got out of prison, where for many years he worked on his memoir called Smuggler.

00:50.480 --> 00:56.080
 This podcast is an exploration of his story. Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:56.080 --> 01:03.120
 Noom, Allform, ExpressVPN, FourSigmatic, and AIDSleep. Check them out in the description

01:03.120 --> 01:08.640
 to support this podcast. Let me say a few words about Roger Reeves, Pablo Escobar, and the war on

01:08.640 --> 01:14.880
 drugs. This conversation with Roger is unlike any I've ever done. In the eyes of many, including

01:14.880 --> 01:19.680
 the law, Roger is a criminal, a bad man who has added to the suffering in the world.

01:20.320 --> 01:26.000
 But he never directly engaged or participated in the violence. Unlike his bosses, Pablo

01:26.000 --> 01:33.360
 Escobar and Jorge Ochoa. His crime was a transport of drugs. I thought about this,

01:33.360 --> 01:39.520
 and about Pablo Escobar, who was at once both a brutal murderer and a Robin Hood figure who

01:39.520 --> 01:46.000
 helped the poor and was loved by thousands, if not millions. We sometimes idolize murderers

01:46.000 --> 01:51.360
 and destroy good honest men. We give power and money to corrupt politicians and dictators that

01:51.360 --> 01:57.520
 starve and murder their own people. Given this, I think about what makes for a good man and what

01:57.520 --> 02:03.840
 makes for a bad man and who decides. Sitting across from Roger, I saw a complicated man,

02:04.480 --> 02:11.120
 but one who has kindness in his heart, a love for money and adventure, and a disdain for violence.

02:11.840 --> 02:18.000
 Again, his crime was a transport of drugs. Since 1971, the war on drugs has cost us

02:18.000 --> 02:25.280
 one trillion dollars. Marijuana legalization alone would save and make 13.7 billion dollars

02:25.920 --> 02:30.160
 that could send more than 650,000 students to public universities every year.

02:31.120 --> 02:36.400
 Then there's the human stories of the 500,000 human beings sitting in prison for drug related

02:36.400 --> 02:43.040
 offenses and the 1.1 million on probation and parole. Their life is damaged or ruined beyond

02:43.040 --> 02:48.800
 repair due to the prohibition of drugs. There's a lot more to be said about the damage done by

02:48.800 --> 02:54.400
 the war on drugs, but when reading about Roger's story and talking to him, I couldn't escape the

02:54.400 --> 02:59.920
 thought that while society wants to label him a criminal and a bad human being, there are much

02:59.920 --> 03:07.120
 worse men out there who we give a past to, even give power to, even men who hold political office

03:07.120 --> 03:13.920
 or run companies. I also think about my role as an interviewer, sitting across a man like Roger

03:13.920 --> 03:19.920
 in these interviews, in life, in many ways I continue to be myself. A person who like

03:19.920 --> 03:26.720
 Dostoyevsky's the idiot seeks the good in all people, but is hurt by it on occasion and maybe

03:26.720 --> 03:34.160
 is destroyed by it in the end. I'm not naive, but I'm also optimistic and have hope for humanity.

03:34.160 --> 03:38.800
 That's who I am and that's what these conversations are. I hope you join me

03:38.800 --> 03:45.040
 and I hope you understand that I come from a place of love. This is the Lex Friedman podcast

03:45.040 --> 03:52.320
 and here's my conversation with Roger Reeves. You are one of the most prolific drug smugglers in

03:52.320 --> 03:59.360
 history. What would you say motivated you? Money, power, the thrill or was it something else?

03:59.360 --> 04:05.440
 Money, but isn't there a point where you've had more money that you can possibly know what to do

04:05.440 --> 04:15.520
 with? Was it always more money? You know, I had plenty of money several times and I think it's

04:15.520 --> 04:21.280
 sort of like if you was in Las Vegas and you had to slot machine handle down and the gold coins

04:21.280 --> 04:26.320
 was tumbling around you and you had sweepers bagging them up, when would you let it go?

04:26.320 --> 04:32.480
 But isn't some part of that the thrill then? Oh, there was a lot of thrill, sometimes way too much.

04:33.040 --> 04:38.800
 You made certainly tens of millions of dollars probably much more. What memorable experience

04:38.800 --> 04:42.960
 did having that much money make possible for you? So there's one thing is the money

04:43.920 --> 04:49.360
 and the other thing is what that money can buy. Well, I bought everything that I could hide.

04:49.360 --> 04:58.480
 I bought seven farms. I owned the land where the city of Merino Valley, California is.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.960
 I had an option on that land. Did the planning and development of that,

05:04.240 --> 05:11.520
 the most expensive coin in the world, yachts, ships, airplanes, glower.

05:12.240 --> 05:18.960
 Did that bring you happiness? No, absolutely not. In fact, I think I'm happier now. I know I'm happier

05:18.960 --> 05:28.480
 now. So looking back, would you do it the same way all again? No way. Really, even the thrill of it?

05:28.480 --> 05:33.360
 Not even the thrill of it. It wasn't worth 33 years in prison being away from my lovely family.

05:34.800 --> 05:40.160
 So money, what about the power just being on top of the world where nobody can,

05:40.160 --> 05:50.960
 and not the governments, the police, all the big bad agencies chasing you. You could do whatever

05:50.960 --> 05:56.560
 the heck you wanted. As far as having to look over your shoulder everywhere you went and every

05:56.560 --> 06:01.280
 phone call you made, make sure that you was naked with somebody in the ocean before you talked.

06:01.280 --> 06:09.360
 It's rather uncomfortable. Yeah. I like to make phone calls the same way.

06:10.800 --> 06:17.200
 What was it like meeting and working with Pablo Escobar, the leader of the Medellin cartel?

06:18.240 --> 06:22.560
 He was just seemed like a gentleman when I met him. He was just like you and I sitting here

06:22.560 --> 06:29.280
 shook hands and I had flown one load for a fella and it didn't work out well. The fella,

06:29.280 --> 06:33.520
 I give it to, got shot and it took a while to get my money in. They didn't put as many kilos on

06:33.520 --> 06:37.920
 the plane as they're supposed to and so I wasn't going to work with them anymore and my contact

06:37.920 --> 06:45.200
 down there introduced me to Jorge Ochoa and we went up and in Bogota we went up and the gate

06:45.200 --> 06:50.720
 opened and we was escorted in. They must have been 50 men out in the yards, a hitch and rail on an

06:50.720 --> 06:57.680
 old house and we were escorted right in and they was a beautiful woman in there. I mean,

06:57.680 --> 07:04.160
 gorgeous, drop dead beautiful and she made us a cup of coffee and then was ushered in to see

07:04.160 --> 07:09.760
 Jorge Ochoa and he had 12 telephones on his desk and all of them was a different color

07:09.760 --> 07:15.280
 and he shook hands, was very friendly, spoke English and he said that each one of those

07:15.280 --> 07:20.240
 telephones represented another city in the United States. This is Chicago and this is New York.

07:20.240 --> 07:25.680
 If I ring, I knew who was calling and so we chatted a while and he asked me what type of

07:25.680 --> 07:32.320
 airplanes I had and what experience I had flying across the U.S. border and I told him he seemed

07:33.680 --> 07:39.520
 pleased with it and he called the lady in and she went next door and came Pablo Escobar and he

07:39.520 --> 07:45.680
 introduced me to Pablo Escobar and he asked the same questions again and I answered him and I said,

07:47.760 --> 07:54.480
 and I asked him how much he paid and they paid $5,000 a kilo to haul it and so I said how much

07:54.480 --> 07:59.680
 you put on the plane? It's $300,000, $500,000. That's one and a half, two and a half million

07:59.680 --> 08:04.800
 dollars for an eight hour trip. It sounded pretty good to me. And we're talking about cocaine and

08:04.800 --> 08:11.760
 we're talking about Columbia. Columbia and cocaine and Medellin cartel and Jorge Ochoa was one of the,

08:11.760 --> 08:15.600
 what would you say, founding members of the committee? Probably the brains behind the whole

08:15.600 --> 08:21.360
 thing. The brains and spoke good English. Yes. And they were nice people. Really nice people.

08:21.360 --> 08:25.600
 Were you scared? Not at all. What's wrong with your mind that you weren't scared?

08:26.400 --> 08:31.040
 Here's some of the most dangerous men in this world and you weren't scared.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.000
 Well, I knew I was going to do exactly what I said I was going to do.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.360
 Murray and the children were down there. They went down and they stayed in the hotel and five

08:37.360 --> 08:42.480
 stars treated royally on my first looting. And they just did ask security to make sure

08:42.480 --> 08:49.920
 that I wasn't a DEA agent. So I did the first looting. They can say they were hostages,

08:49.920 --> 08:55.440
 but they really weren't. It was just an insurance. So there was some integrity to the way they

08:55.440 --> 09:04.800
 operated? Completely. I mean straight up. The money was ironed and banded and just right.

09:04.800 --> 09:08.480
 And the numbers would never want anything wrong with it.

09:09.120 --> 09:15.840
 What would you attribute that honesty to? Within their own moral system and their

09:15.840 --> 09:24.320
 own set of rules, why weren't people crossing the line and shaving off the top and injecting chaos

09:24.320 --> 09:30.160
 into the system to where it would be unpredictable and people would be dishonest and greedy and

09:30.160 --> 09:34.240
 all those kinds of things. That's true. Most people are, but there's certain people at the

09:34.240 --> 09:39.360
 top of the food chain that they don't need that. And if they're completely honest,

09:40.320 --> 09:44.800
 then they don't have to think of, remember the lie they told. And plus they're just

09:44.800 --> 09:50.000
 honest to start with. They make him plenty of money. They was making as much money as I did.

09:51.440 --> 09:57.840
 I'll tell you how that came about. I understand that 10,000 people were killed every year in

09:57.840 --> 10:04.960
 Medellin, Columbia. And what they were doing, they didn't have any organization. And if one

10:04.960 --> 10:10.560
 fellow had 10 kilos and he wanted to ship to New York, he would tell his friend. And his friend

10:10.560 --> 10:14.160
 said, sure, I'll ship it. I have a pilot and I'll ship it up. And then he would look in the

10:14.160 --> 10:20.320
 newspapers. Oh, 40 kilos was busted in New Jersey. I'm so sorry. Yours got busted. Bang, bang. He's

10:20.320 --> 10:29.440
 dead. So here comes Jorge Ochoa and three Ochoa brothers and Pablo Escobar and Gacho. And they

10:29.440 --> 10:36.560
 decided that we will make an insurance company that we would charge you $10,000 to take it to your

10:36.560 --> 10:43.840
 contact in Miami. If it gets lost anywhere between the time I put it on the airplane

10:43.840 --> 10:48.480
 or the time you give it to us and the time we give it to your man, we will replace it in

10:48.480 --> 10:54.480
 Columbia for you. So there was no way anybody could lose. And I understand they got 100 tons

10:54.480 --> 11:01.920
 piled up under that insurance program. And I was right there the first day. So I had all the work

11:01.920 --> 11:06.640
 I could do. I would land in this. I said, when do you want me to come back? We waiting on you,

11:06.640 --> 11:15.040
 senor. Well, let me ask a difficult question. Some see Escobar as a brutal murderer and some see him

11:15.040 --> 11:21.360
 as maybe a Robin Hood like figure who helped the poor. How do you see the man? Both of them.

11:22.160 --> 11:26.880
 I think he started out to be honest with the help of the poor. And then they had a war down there.

11:26.880 --> 11:32.160
 And they blew up and killed his people. And the country was divided almost equally three ways.

11:32.160 --> 11:39.120
 They had the military. They were just as much into it as anybody. And then you had the

11:39.120 --> 11:44.080
 fart gorillas. They had about a third of the country. And then you had the conchers. It was

11:44.080 --> 11:49.600
 like the white farmers. And they're the ones that I was dealing with. And they were at war with one

11:49.600 --> 11:54.880
 another. And so if one of them started killing their people, I'll kill some of yours too.

11:55.680 --> 11:59.920
 So that's how it happened. And then when I heard about Pablo Escobar

11:59.920 --> 12:04.160
 blowing up that airliner and killing those women and children, I was sorry I ever shook his hand.

12:04.960 --> 12:10.640
 That's brutal murder. So you would say Escobar is not a good man?

12:10.640 --> 12:15.920
 Not at all. It's terrible. Now that looking back on it, when I met him, he was good.

12:16.720 --> 12:22.000
 Did just exactly what he said he would do. Could he be a bad man and a man you can trust?

12:23.040 --> 12:24.800
 Absolutely. You could trust him, yes.

12:24.800 --> 12:33.360
 So from your perspective, in terms of business, he was reliable. He was honest.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.600
 Had integrity. You could work with him. He felt safe.

12:38.160 --> 12:45.280
 Completely. We flew up into his ranch and we brought out motorcycles to start with.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.120
 And can you ride a motorcycle? Of course I can ride a motorcycle. So I took off

12:49.120 --> 12:53.520
 across the grass and there was a little ditch there in the front wheel dropped and that thing.

12:53.520 --> 12:58.080
 And I must have slid across that grass 20 feet before I got stopped. He almost fell

12:58.080 --> 13:03.280
 off his bike waiting because they knew what it was going to do. And then we got on horses.

13:03.280 --> 13:08.160
 And we went out there and pretended to type or round up some cows and he put a Mac 10 machine

13:08.160 --> 13:12.960
 gun pistol over my shoulder. You know how to use this? Well, I never had, but it was all right.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.960
 I think it was like, okay, you got 10 bodyguards. What do you need me for?

13:17.680 --> 13:21.840
 So that's the kind of time we laughed and talked and drove some cows over the stumps.

13:21.840 --> 13:28.160
 You said Jorge Ochoa was perhaps the brains of the Medellin Cartel.

13:30.160 --> 13:34.160
 What was he like? And why do you say he was the brains?

13:34.960 --> 13:41.760
 Well, he was a gentleman. And I suppose he shipped, you know, tell me how many more times of cocaine

13:41.760 --> 13:47.760
 than Pablo did. Just him and his brothers, you could tell by the, they had on each load,

13:47.760 --> 13:56.400
 they was in duffel bags and his big football shaped fluffy stuff made with ether. And they

13:56.400 --> 14:02.800
 would have three horns on it or a rattlesnake or four X's on each bag. You kind of got to know

14:02.800 --> 14:09.760
 in which was, which was which and they shipped a lot. So, and he was just a gentleman. I took

14:09.760 --> 14:17.440
 him to family. We went one weekend to his ranch or his, my life show place out near Barranquilla.

14:17.440 --> 14:24.560
 And oh, we, he just treated the family and his family had a, his younger brother made a bull fight

14:24.560 --> 14:33.440
 and we had skiing and little airplanes on floats on the water. It was really nice and he was really

14:33.440 --> 14:42.800
 nice. How do you make sense of the tension that a man could be a gentleman, can have integrity,

14:42.800 --> 14:48.720
 but also be a murderer? Well, murder is, is a, is a stronger word than killing.

14:49.920 --> 14:55.840
 Can you explain the, the, the line, the gray area we're talking about? I mean, I've just

14:55.840 --> 15:03.200
 talking with Jaco willing. Can we talk to a lot about killing in the context of military conflict

15:03.200 --> 15:09.280
 in the context of war? So there, there's a line between murder and killing that you can draw.

15:09.840 --> 15:14.160
 What's the line that you're referring to? It's something similar. If you, if people shooting

15:14.160 --> 15:17.840
 at you and you shoot back and kill him, I don't, that's not murder whatsoever. It's,

15:19.040 --> 15:25.760
 he's trying to get away or out of the situation. But if some woman don't pay you and you

15:25.760 --> 15:30.720
 send a hit man over to kill her and her children, that's, that's, that's murder, that's murder.

15:30.720 --> 15:35.360
 Was Jorge involved in those kinds of things? I don't think so at all. It just, I mean, he was,

15:35.360 --> 15:40.320
 he was just such a gentleman. He had a restaurant before and, and he was just smart. I understand

15:40.320 --> 15:46.160
 that the first 10 kilos he sold, he was sitting on a, on a motorcycle in the, in the sidelines in

15:46.160 --> 15:51.360
 a parking lot when the DEA come in, he's sped away. So he didn't come back to America. He was

15:51.360 --> 15:56.240
 just smart. Some people just have, are savvy. And he was such a gentleman and the whole family,

15:56.240 --> 16:01.280
 the mother and the father, the two brothers, their sister, I was there when she was kidnapped.

16:01.280 --> 16:10.400
 And finally he kidnapped our, I guess a hundred leaders of the FARC and said, all right, I mean,

16:10.400 --> 16:14.480
 she don't come back. None of these are going to come back. So they made a deal.

16:15.280 --> 16:19.520
 Is there something you can say about the power structure, the hierarchy of the median cartel

16:19.520 --> 16:25.840
 that you interacted with? Was, was it a dictatorship where Pablo ran everything?

16:25.840 --> 16:32.080
 Was there a bunch of power centers? Was it like a company with you have CEO, CTO kind of thing?

16:32.640 --> 16:35.680
 And then there's like managers and all those kinds of things. What's the,

16:36.800 --> 16:39.200
 like, how did it run from a leadership perspective?

16:40.160 --> 16:45.280
 I understand that about five of them got together and made this, I will call it an insurance

16:45.280 --> 16:52.240
 company. And now known as the Medellin Cartel. And I didn't see any difference. Each one of them

16:52.800 --> 17:00.320
 had their own business and their people from the jungle or wherever made the cocaine, gave it to

17:00.320 --> 17:06.000
 them and they shipped it. And so it didn't, it didn't seem to be any, any power play between

17:06.000 --> 17:12.880
 them at all. But my main contact was Jorge Ochoa and Pablo Escobar was right there.

17:12.880 --> 17:18.480
 And I saw plenty of stuff for him too. It's strange that they didn't betray each other

17:19.280 --> 17:27.760
 regularly. You know, greed makes men betray each other. How do you explain that? How much

17:27.760 --> 17:34.960
 betrayal did you see? I didn't see any, absolutely none. If, if they shipped his 100 kilos, he got

17:34.960 --> 17:40.720
 paid for it. If the other one shipped his, I'm sure they got paid for it. How do you explain that?

17:40.720 --> 17:46.560
 Well, there was no need to. The money was just unbelievable. You think about 500 kilos in the

17:46.560 --> 17:58.560
 plane at $50,000 a kilo at the time. And they paid $5,000 to ship it. And they made $5,000

17:59.120 --> 18:03.120
 without even touching it. They just had somebody to load it on through the airplane.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.360
 I gave it to their man in Miami. They gave it to whoever it belonged to by the,

18:07.360 --> 18:16.640
 by the marks on the duffel bags. So they was making just untold millions. Just no reason.

18:16.640 --> 18:23.760
 But greed can blind men. I, you know, it's still, it's still strange to me

18:24.480 --> 18:29.840
 that there was not more betrayal. It speaks to something else perhaps that's bigger than money.

18:29.840 --> 18:36.800
 Maybe, maybe, maybe not. But it seems like just like in the casino, like you mentioned,

18:37.920 --> 18:43.680
 we get accustomed to whatever level of money we have, we get accustomed very quickly.

18:43.680 --> 18:51.200
 Yes. And then there's a tension that's natural between human beings. And when that tension

18:51.200 --> 18:56.880
 combined with money, combined with power, combined with, like you mentioned, beautiful women

18:56.880 --> 19:05.120
 and a bit of violence, it seems that betrayal should become a place. But it's not.

19:05.120 --> 19:09.520
 It wasn't. Not at all. They said, Carlos later, I don't know if he betrayed anybody,

19:09.520 --> 19:14.000
 but he started that. He was running cocaine through the Bahamas. And he had the island.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.760
 I didn't go, I was offered to fly with a DC three with that, but I didn't like it.

19:18.480 --> 19:23.840
 So I had my route through the old wheels in Louisiana. And so I didn't want to change.

19:23.840 --> 19:28.080
 But he talked a lot. And I don't know if he betrayed, but they didn't like him.

19:29.440 --> 19:34.960
 Yeah. So as you expand, there could be tensions that lead to conflict.

19:35.520 --> 19:42.720
 Columbia was, like you said, an ultra violent place. How did you survive? Who protected you?

19:43.360 --> 19:48.960
 I was a hero. They liked me. I mean, I was just treated royally. All I did, I would come over

19:48.960 --> 19:54.000
 El Banco. There's a radio station at the Forks of the Magdalena River. I believe it was 720,

19:54.000 --> 20:00.080
 if I remember right, on the AM. And I'd fly at 10,000 feet and I'd see below me, there'd be a

20:00.080 --> 20:05.120
 Cessna. And I'd wiggle my wings and he'd wiggle his and I'd fall in behind him. And we might go

20:05.120 --> 20:13.280
 100, 200 miles, not land on some jungle strip or some banana plantation. And they'd fuel me up.

20:13.280 --> 20:19.600
 I could eat steak in the night. It was just like treated royally. And I mean, take off the next

20:19.600 --> 20:25.120
 morning, whenever I wanted to, it was just like that was protected. And I was honored guest.

20:25.840 --> 20:31.040
 It wasn't anything like in that movie, putting a gun to your head and taking your sunglasses

20:31.040 --> 20:37.040
 and betting. So one time I complained to Jorge Ochoa that the runway was pretty short

20:37.040 --> 20:40.960
 that they were using. And I went back down and it looked like Los Angeles International. They

20:40.960 --> 20:47.360
 had to bulldozers in there. Had to think 5,000 feet long. Just like the next week it was all done.

20:47.360 --> 20:53.360
 The jungle was gone and Clay put up there. And all the while, you were not afraid. You were

20:53.360 --> 20:58.560
 treated like a royalty. Yes, there I was. I was afraid when I landed in the United States.

20:58.560 --> 21:04.560
 Well, maybe let's go back to the beginning. What was the first time you all flew an airplane

21:04.560 --> 21:08.640
 with drugs on it? Tell me the story, the first time you smuggled drugs.

21:08.640 --> 21:18.880
 All right. I flew down to Jalapa Veracruz with a Cessna 182. And we landed the town. It was a

21:18.880 --> 21:23.920
 lovely town. Just an old town looked like Bible times. People, women were washing their clothes

21:23.920 --> 21:29.680
 in the streets with stone basins and the stream running through. I just was just dumbstruck.

21:29.680 --> 21:33.840
 It was just so pretty. And I went in a church, a Catholic church, and it had the stations of

21:33.840 --> 21:39.440
 the cross all carved magnificent. I had never seen that. And I come home and told Murray about

21:39.440 --> 21:44.240
 that. That just almost brought tears to my eyes. It was so beautiful. And three o clock the next

21:44.240 --> 21:48.640
 morning, I went out to the airport and taxied down to the taxiway. And there was a guard came out.

21:49.680 --> 21:54.560
 And I wanted to know what I was doing. And I pulled out. I was on the fire department

21:54.560 --> 22:00.080
 at Redondo Beach, California. So I pulled out my wallet and it was a fire department badge.

22:00.080 --> 22:06.560
 And oh, he shook my hand. We're so glad. So I taxed it on down and we loaded up about 400 pounds

22:06.560 --> 22:12.080
 in the plane. And I came on back and I was running the headwinds more than I thought.

22:12.080 --> 22:15.520
 And I landed on a little strip. You're talking about on the way back?

22:16.240 --> 22:19.120
 On the way back on the way north after we loaded up early in the morning.

22:19.680 --> 22:25.280
 And I just for only time I ever got vertigo, the mountains were coming down at a 30 or 40 degree

22:25.280 --> 22:31.120
 angle in the Milky Way was overhead. And somehow I wanted that airplane to be level with the stars.

22:31.680 --> 22:36.720
 And it got it got me. And it's a phenomenon of how vertigo is the only time I ever had it was

22:36.720 --> 22:40.960
 on that load. So anyway, the wind was on the nose of that system. I wasn't going to make it to the

22:40.960 --> 22:46.240
 dry lake where I had fuel. So I landed on a little bitty strip. There was a little house

22:46.240 --> 22:50.720
 that was caved in. And it was a little boy named Lazarus about six or seven years old.

22:50.720 --> 22:55.280
 And he was herding some goats. So we put the marijuana in that house and the man stayed with it.

22:55.280 --> 23:00.000
 So while I flew into some town and got fuel and came back and we sat down with the lunch that I

23:00.000 --> 23:03.920
 brought back and little Lazarus sat there and ate with us. And we had a good time. We loaded

23:03.920 --> 23:12.960
 him back and came home. Oh, wow. I wonder where he is now. So what was it like to fly? Maybe

23:12.960 --> 23:19.840
 describe the details of do you have to fly low? Is there details that are unique to this

23:19.840 --> 23:26.080
 experience of flying an airplane with drugs on it on board? All right. Well, one of the mistakes

23:26.080 --> 23:30.640
 that just thousands and hundreds and thousands of pilots make, they don't stop at the border

23:30.640 --> 23:36.880
 going down and get their permit. Once you get a permit to be in Mexico, you've got it for six months.

23:37.520 --> 23:41.600
 You can go anywhere, any fishing village, any little town, any little place,

23:41.600 --> 23:45.200
 show them this and you're welcome. If you don't have that, you go straight to jail.

23:46.240 --> 23:49.600
 So you go down there and you think, okay, they're going to have fuel for me to come back and so

23:49.600 --> 23:54.880
 forth. Oh, sorry, senior. That was had a rusty leak in it. We don't have any. Well, you better

23:54.880 --> 24:01.120
 be able to go to town and get it. So that's what I did. And when I was coming back for several

24:01.120 --> 24:08.720
 years, I would fly up in Mexicali and cross the border right at Calexico. Just I would act like

24:08.720 --> 24:14.240
 I was landing on the Calexico side just after dark. Then I'd zip across the border and I go to the

24:14.240 --> 24:19.440
 Salton Sea and go below sea level, a hundred and something feet, I believe 170 feet, and come on up

24:19.440 --> 24:25.840
 and go out there and palm springs and land out 29 palms in the desert and put my stuff under a

24:25.840 --> 24:30.480
 Joshua tree and fly into town and get my pickup and go on back out and get it. And that was fun.

24:31.200 --> 24:36.080
 And then it got really dangerous. They had Operation Starlight, I believe was the name of it. And

24:36.080 --> 24:40.960
 they called a lot of pilots coming across the border. So I changed it. And by that time,

24:40.960 --> 24:47.840
 I was flying bigger planes. I was flying beach 18s. And I would refuel in Mulaje on halfway down on

24:48.480 --> 24:55.280
 Baja Peninsula. And then over in the middle, 20 miles from the nearest road was a goat ranch

24:55.280 --> 25:01.040
 where they milk goats and made cheese. And I would go there and unload the load coming up out of

25:01.040 --> 25:08.560
 anywhere in southern Mexico. And I would land there and a guy named Juan would put the marijuana

25:08.560 --> 25:15.600
 under the trees and I'd fly into Mulaje and they'd wash my plane and gas it up and I'd eat lunch and

25:15.600 --> 25:19.760
 rent a room for a few hours and take a nap and shower and then go back in the afternoon and

25:19.760 --> 25:25.680
 fill up. And then I would go northwest out of there and fly 200 miles off the coast of the island of

25:25.680 --> 25:31.040
 Guadalupe. And from there, I would fly on a more northwestern heading about 300 miles out over the

25:31.040 --> 25:36.880
 Pacific. And then I would come in behind the Santa Barbara Islands down low and then I'd come up

25:36.880 --> 25:41.920
 and go out in the desert land. And I did that for the rest of the marijuana trips.

25:44.720 --> 25:50.640
 What was the hardest part about flying those routes? The hardest part was getting good marijuana.

25:52.720 --> 25:56.960
 So the hardest part isn't the flying? No, it's the flying. It's just like driving your car down.

25:56.960 --> 26:01.600
 But then I had people that would bring me on strips that were just unworthy of an airplane

26:01.600 --> 26:08.960
 like when I'd land on a highway. And in the rainy season, I would come back to land again

26:08.960 --> 26:14.080
 and the guy wouldn't think about it and he'd have like little hills on both sides and the wings

26:14.080 --> 26:19.280
 were out there. Well, the grass and the weeds would grow up and it sounded like, I mean,

26:19.280 --> 26:23.520
 it sounded like tearing the airplane apart when those wings hit and moving the grass down both

26:23.520 --> 26:28.400
 shoulders of the airplane. The weeds would grow up high in the tropics. So some of that stuff was

26:28.400 --> 26:35.280
 bad and oh, getting bad gasoline and telling me that land here in the light and knocked the wheels

26:35.280 --> 26:39.760
 off when you land. Oh, you should have landed a little further up here, senior. They ditched down.

26:41.440 --> 26:46.240
 That sort of thing. What was it like landing on a highway? And when did you have to land on a

26:46.240 --> 26:51.520
 highway? I landed on a highway most of my life, most of the times. In Mexico, first time I went

26:51.520 --> 26:58.880
 down, there was a place called Pichilingi and you had a 900 foot strip and I would fly down and I'd

26:58.880 --> 27:04.800
 carry gasoline with me and Maury and I would go to the grocery store and buy all kinds of little

27:04.800 --> 27:12.640
 goodies and candies and toys to bring to the children. And that sand strip in the bend of a

27:12.640 --> 27:17.680
 river was just too short to take off with a load. So there was a young man there named Pedro,

27:17.680 --> 27:24.240
 must have weighed much over 100, maybe 120 pounds and he'd get in a plane with me and he'd direct

27:24.240 --> 27:31.200
 me 20, 30, 40 miles away to a highway and the people, Joaquin and the people would pull out

27:31.200 --> 27:36.400
 in a two ton truck with a machine gun on it and bunch of guys with their arms with us and they'd

27:36.400 --> 27:40.160
 block the road and then another one would block it up about a mile away and I'd land right over

27:40.160 --> 27:45.120
 that truck and they'd load me up like a bucket brigade with the marijuana coming. I'd shake hands

27:45.120 --> 27:50.320
 with all of them and I'd take off right over the other trucks and sometimes maybe 20, 30, 40 cars

27:50.320 --> 27:56.400
 lined up. One time I remember a patrol car, a highway patrol car, he didn't have his lights on,

27:56.400 --> 28:02.160
 took off right over him and then when I started flying to Louisiana, the bridge over the Mississippi

28:02.160 --> 28:07.760
 River, there were several contractors that went broke and that thing was out for years and about

28:07.760 --> 28:14.320
 five miles from the river was flashing red lights in a detour and then they swamped on both sides

28:14.320 --> 28:20.160
 of it in the middle of it. We're growing up with 20 feet trees and that was like an international

28:20.160 --> 28:24.960
 runaway from anywhere in the world. So I landed on that and over and over those red lights were

28:24.960 --> 28:29.040
 just like the end of a runway and then the next morning we'd go out there and scrub the

28:29.040 --> 28:36.880
 marks off the highway where I'd landed before daylight. Wow. Let's go to somebody you've known

28:36.880 --> 28:45.600
 well, somebody who is also a drug smuggler is Barry Seal. Who is Barry Seal? How did you meet him?

28:45.600 --> 28:53.440
 Barry Seal is a friend of mine. Murray and I and the children went down in Honduras and we went up

28:54.480 --> 28:59.440
 Lake Azul, I believe it was, and we were looking at a ranch to buy. I was looking for something

28:59.440 --> 29:05.280
 in Central America where I'd have a halfway place. It was lovely. We stayed up there for some days

29:05.280 --> 29:09.760
 and our clothes got muddy and we went in the river and all kind of things. So we got to San Pedro

29:09.760 --> 29:17.760
 Sula and we was going back to New Orleans. So we went to the cleaners to get our clothes and most

29:17.760 --> 29:22.880
 all of them was in there and they got, oh, senior, they'll be ready tomorrow morning. We're not ready

29:22.880 --> 29:30.560
 now. Well, the plane leaves at nine o clock or whatever. So I told Murray for her and the children

29:30.560 --> 29:35.760
 to go into the airport because it'd be easier for one just on a standby flight. So I went to the

29:37.840 --> 29:42.160
 laundromat for the clothes and they were ready and there was a pile of them. I put them on my back

29:42.160 --> 29:46.560
 and got into taxiing. The old taxi would drive him with it and I'd give him $100 to go faster and

29:46.560 --> 29:54.560
 he just blew his horn more rapid. So we got to the airport and I jumped out and ran around on

29:54.560 --> 30:03.200
 the tarmac and here's a brand new 727 taxiing out. Oh, no. So I'm waving to the pilot and

30:03.200 --> 30:08.640
 he's a young fellow and he waves back. Then I see Murray's face in the cockpit and the nose goes down

30:08.640 --> 30:13.680
 where he puts on brakes and he laughs and he puts some stairwell out and I run for the stairwell and

30:13.680 --> 30:19.360
 he pulls it back up and goes like a hitchhiker going to pick you up and go again. Then he put it

30:19.360 --> 30:26.240
 out and I got on and the whole crowd's clapped and I'm coming on with that blow to close.

30:26.240 --> 30:31.760
 So I go way down in the middle and the plane's full and Miriam, my daughter's about nine years old

30:31.760 --> 30:36.640
 then and she was sitting in the middle and by the window was Barry Seal. Of course I didn't know it

30:36.640 --> 30:42.880
 and I sat in the middle and we took off and the wheels come up with clunk and then I got up about

30:42.880 --> 30:47.280
 5,000 feet and we had a little clink, clink and she said, what was that daddy? I said he just turned

30:47.280 --> 30:52.000
 on his autopilot and that fellow reached over and I done looked at him. I said, he looks like

30:52.000 --> 30:58.400
 CIA or FBI or something. He ain't spoke to be here. Clear blue eyes, gentlemen looking man

30:59.200 --> 31:04.480
 and he said, you fly these things? I said, I got a few hours mister. He said, I fly them to or

31:04.480 --> 31:08.640
 something other and he said, my name Barry Seal and he reached over Miriam and shook hands and we

31:08.640 --> 31:15.040
 got to talking and I thought there's no choice or seats on this. It's just open seating so

31:15.040 --> 31:21.040
 but I don't believe him one bit and he started talking about he just got out of jail that morning,

31:21.040 --> 31:28.320
 just got out of prison and I said, uh huh and he told me he'd been a pilot with

31:29.040 --> 31:35.280
 TWA and this and other and he told me what he was for and so we had a nice conversation

31:35.280 --> 31:41.200
 for a couple hours to New Orleans. I didn't believe him so he got off in front of us and

31:41.200 --> 31:47.600
 what a crowd of people to meet him. An old mother and a wife and little children hanging on to him

31:47.600 --> 31:54.560
 crying and hugging and kissing. I said, he was telling the truth. So I reached over and gave

31:54.560 --> 31:58.160
 him a little piece of paper. I had Mario to write it out with our address. I said, Barry,

31:58.160 --> 32:03.520
 I might have some work for you. What was he in jail for? He got caught with 100 kilos of cocaine

32:03.520 --> 32:10.400
 in a small plane and so he's preserved a year. And that was from Columbia? I don't know where

32:10.400 --> 32:17.440
 it comes from. He got caught in Honduras probably refueling but he'd been in prison 90 before for

32:17.440 --> 32:24.080
 bringing explosives to the Cuban Contras and he lost his job with the airlines and then later on

32:24.080 --> 32:30.320
 I found out he was ex CIA and George Bush Seniors Prodigy and had a thousand parachute jumps and

32:30.880 --> 32:37.440
 was there. He was a hot shot model. There's a million questions I want to ask here but

32:37.440 --> 32:42.640
 maybe can we linger on a little bit longer? What was your relationship with him like?

32:45.280 --> 32:53.760
 You were a drug smuggler. He's a drug smuggler. Your friends, how often do you guys talk? How

32:53.760 --> 32:59.600
 often do you work together? What was the relationship like? Well, I'll back up and finish where I

32:59.600 --> 33:04.080
 started off there. I gave him the things. Barry, I may have some work for you. I know I got some

33:04.080 --> 33:11.120
 work for you and I says I come out Santa Barbara and so I don't know. A week or two later he flew

33:11.120 --> 33:15.760
 out and went to our house and stayed with us a couple of days and I had an almost brand new

33:16.720 --> 33:21.200
 Arrow Commander 690B. That thing with turbo prop and it was hot. It was the hottest thing I'd

33:21.200 --> 33:28.160
 ever had. So I said, let's go Barry. Let's see what you can do. So I'm sorry I said that. We got

33:28.160 --> 33:34.560
 about 10,000 feet and he was like one of them blue angel pilots. He rung that thing out. That's

33:34.560 --> 33:40.560
 enough and then he did a falling leaf. It's where you cut the engines and the plane falls from side

33:40.560 --> 33:45.520
 to side. I saw Bob Hoover do that in the air show once and that's the only person I ever saw do it

33:45.520 --> 33:50.720
 and my hand was white knuckle hanging onto the seat. You shut off the engine? Yeah,

33:50.720 --> 33:56.160
 he shut off the engines and landed flying side by side like this. How do you explain that? Was he

33:56.160 --> 34:02.800
 just a wild man or was he sufficiently skilled to work? He was sufficiently skilled. Absolutely.

34:02.800 --> 34:07.360
 He knew what he was doing. I can get a plane from one spot to another and I guess I'm known

34:07.360 --> 34:15.120
 as a good pilot but that guy was an aerobatic. So anyway, he stayed with us a couple of days and

34:15.120 --> 34:20.160
 then I told him, I said, this plane needs tanking. I said, I got some work down in Columbia,

34:20.160 --> 34:25.040
 needs to come back to Louisiana and I need 2500 mile range. He said, I got somebody in

34:25.040 --> 34:29.600
 Meena, Arkansas, do that and keep them out shut. So I gave him $10,000 and he flew away

34:30.480 --> 34:36.400
 and in a few days he called me and says, come to my house in Baton Rouge. So I went out to his

34:36.400 --> 34:41.760
 house in Baton Rouge and I stayed with him for a few days and that plane was tanked. I mean beautiful

34:41.760 --> 34:50.560
 from stem to stern. I could went from Bolivia to Canada with it. So he was then I hired him to fly

34:50.560 --> 34:56.720
 and he was funny. I paid him a million dollars a trip. I paid him $2,000 a kilo so about a million

34:56.720 --> 35:02.640
 dollar trip and I didn't get paid until the people received it. They had to ship it to

35:02.640 --> 35:06.800
 Chicago and New York and then the money come back. So it was a couple of two or three weeks

35:06.800 --> 35:13.280
 pipeline. Well, I always had to pay him before he'd go again. I mean, and he belly ache. I mean,

35:13.280 --> 35:21.440
 he had my own in Rome. So one time I gave him a million dollars and I put it in a box real nice.

35:21.440 --> 35:25.120
 So how big is a box that contains a million dollars? So we're talking about $100 bills?

35:25.120 --> 35:31.040
 $100. It's not very big. You can put it in a large briefcase. It weighs exactly 10 kilos.

35:32.240 --> 35:36.080
 Each bill weighs a gram so you can weigh your money and almost get it exactly.

35:36.080 --> 35:43.680
 10, 20 something pounds is a million dollars. 22 pounds. $100 bills. But in $100 bills,

35:43.680 --> 35:50.560
 it's one ton, 2,200 pounds. We didn't even accept them. Were you the one that introduced

35:50.560 --> 35:58.640
 Barry Seale to Pablo Escobar? No. I didn't introduce him at all. And our deal was that you

35:58.640 --> 36:03.360
 don't meet my people. I mean, we just kind of crossed New York for me to fly the airplanes.

36:03.360 --> 36:09.600
 So he wanted these Panther conversions because $400,000 each with dormscope and radar. So I

36:09.600 --> 36:13.600
 don't want anything you want. What does that mean, sorry, to interrupt Panther conversions?

36:14.240 --> 36:20.160
 Panther conversion was these people called Panther. They took everything out from the

36:20.160 --> 36:25.520
 firewall and instruments and all and converted them and put QTIP propellers on them full bladed.

36:25.520 --> 36:31.680
 And you very quiet and the CIA developed those in Southeast Asia for running behind the lines.

36:31.680 --> 36:36.640
 And that's where Barry had flown the new thing. So he knew about them. So that's what he wanted

36:36.640 --> 36:41.680
 and that's what we got him. How does that connect to Pablo? And so he worked for you and you got

36:41.680 --> 36:46.720
 those upgrades? I think he flew about 30 loads for me. And then I got arrested and was about

36:47.520 --> 36:54.400
 everything in the world. Got 35 years sentence. But let me back up a little bit. Barry was our

36:54.400 --> 37:03.120
 friend. Mari and I, both friend. We should pause real quick and say Mari is your wife and we'll

37:03.120 --> 37:09.280
 hopefully she'll we'll convince her to join us in a little bit. She's the love of your life and

37:09.280 --> 37:15.280
 sort of she weaves in and out of many of these stories that you tell. Yes. She was there. She

37:15.280 --> 37:20.080
 was behind the scenes, but I kept her out of it completely. And then also you mentioned Miriam

37:20.080 --> 37:27.280
 as your daughter. Yes. Our son was a baby. And I remember we went out to the festival.

37:27.280 --> 37:32.720
 It was my favorite restaurant in Carl Gables. Oh God, it was good. And Barry knew about it.

37:32.720 --> 37:39.760
 Anyhow, we went out to dinner. So we came back and there was no rooms. So Barry was in the

37:39.760 --> 37:45.520
 night with us. So he goes to our hotel room with us. We got two big beds and the omnihotel.

37:45.520 --> 37:50.480
 And he lays over there and gets down to his striped undershorts and his T shirt. And he puts

37:50.480 --> 37:55.440
 the baby up on his belly and gives him the bottle. He says, isn't that good, Red? Oh, my, my. And he

37:55.440 --> 38:01.120
 just feeds the baby. We laugh and talk. And that's how close we were that we could all stay in the

38:01.120 --> 38:07.200
 hotel room together. And would you say he's a good man? Oh, wonderful man. A gentleman,

38:07.920 --> 38:13.440
 southern gentleman. Just looked after his mother, his family, everybody around him. Everybody love

38:13.440 --> 38:20.720
 Barry. He just had a little smile on his face always. So you got arrested and then what happened

38:20.720 --> 38:27.840
 to Barry? Well, Barry knew the people that unloaded. Of course, he sent the cars down,

38:27.840 --> 38:34.240
 all that. So he met the unloader, a guy named Lito, Louis Carlos Bustamante of Venezuelan.

38:35.120 --> 38:41.440
 So he just kept on flying. But he, I believe he had three of my airplanes at $400,000 a piece.

38:41.440 --> 38:45.680
 And they owed me some money. Well, he collected a lot of that and gave Murray the money and put

38:45.680 --> 38:50.560
 it in his safe and took her to his house and all after I got arrested and sent a lawyer in. He

38:50.560 --> 38:55.520
 got me the best lawyer in the country, Albert Krieger. He was head of the defense team for

38:55.520 --> 39:04.720
 all of America. Wonderful man. Can you tell the story of the months that led up to Barry's assassination?

39:05.680 --> 39:09.840
 What did you know? What did you sense? What did you think?

39:09.840 --> 39:14.720
 Okay, when I got out of prison, I hadn't been out long. I was eating breakfast and there was

39:14.720 --> 39:21.760
 Ronald Reagan's face right in the television. We have absolute proof that the communist Sandinista

39:21.760 --> 39:29.200
 government is in the cocaine running business. And there was that fat lady, the C126, on the runway

39:29.200 --> 39:36.240
 with the bellied in and I thought, oh, God, he had done it. So I had heard that Barry might

39:36.240 --> 39:43.680
 been working with him. So it wasn't long before with the DEA or whoever, that he is even no longer

39:43.680 --> 39:51.360
 on our side, you know. So can you clarify how you got that from the Reagan making a statement about

39:51.360 --> 39:56.960
 we've heard? Okay, there was his plane. There was Barry's plane. And okay, on the way north,

39:56.960 --> 40:02.000
 we could stop in Nicaragua and land on a military base or on a base that they used,

40:02.000 --> 40:07.360
 those crop dusters and all and refuel. And so that short and our trip would go further into

40:07.360 --> 40:11.440
 the jungle and come up and that was what Pablo Escobar and Ocho and them and they had to,

40:11.440 --> 40:19.920
 they was associates with the people in Nicaragua. So Barry was, if that plane was there, that means

40:19.920 --> 40:24.240
 Barry was feeding the DEA information. He was working with them at that time.

40:24.240 --> 40:30.480
 But let me back up a little bit. When I was flying and I told Barry, we would refuel and

40:30.480 --> 40:37.680
 train airplane, the loads in Belize where I had a spot up there. And then that's when they told

40:37.680 --> 40:44.800
 me we can refuel in Nicaragua. And then you fly all the way and Barry couldn't believe it. He says,

40:44.800 --> 40:50.480
 all right, but I wanted to land, I had a place in Louisiana for $10,000 that I could land unloading

40:50.480 --> 40:58.400
 a chair if an old one was paid off. And he said, no, no, no. I can't get caught in me in Arkansas.

40:58.400 --> 41:01.920
 I said, what do you mean? You can't get caught in me in Arkansas. You get caught anywhere.

41:02.960 --> 41:08.160
 He said, I can't, but it's going to cost you $50,000 every time my wheels touch the ground.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.960
 Why can you explain why he can't get caught in me in Arkansas?

41:12.960 --> 41:17.680
 He said he was hooked up with them at the very top. And he even said, I'm going to have dinner

41:17.680 --> 41:22.880
 with the governor tonight. That's at that time, Mr. Bill Clinton.

41:22.880 --> 41:28.480
 Undoubtedly. And it's like, did Bill Clinton, did you give him any money? And I said, no,

41:28.480 --> 41:32.560
 I never give the man any money. But it was like the money that I had that went to the Grand Cayman

41:32.560 --> 41:36.640
 Islands. And I told my lawyer, I said, I never touched that money. He said, you don't have to

41:36.640 --> 41:44.400
 fondle it to be guilty. So, I mean, there's a lot of conspiracy theories around the relationship

41:44.400 --> 41:49.440
 between Barry Steele and the Clintons. Absolutely. What evidence do we have?

41:49.440 --> 41:57.520
 What would you say from your best understanding of what was the relationship between Bill Clinton

41:57.520 --> 42:04.160
 and Barry Steele? Barry said, and he knew that he couldn't get caught in me in Arkansas. And when

42:04.160 --> 42:10.160
 that movie was going to come out, be called Mina, somebody stopped it. I mean, they stopped it dead

42:10.160 --> 42:14.640
 in the tracks for two or three years and the producer even quit. You mean the American Made

42:14.640 --> 42:20.480
 with Tom Cruise movie? It was going to be called Mina. Yes, the name it was written and produced in Mina.

42:21.600 --> 42:28.400
 And waiting on Hillary to be elected, they would not let that movie out. And that movie

42:28.400 --> 42:33.680
 would change drastically. But to push back on that, that doesn't mean there's truth there. That means

42:33.680 --> 42:41.440
 they were worried about the power of the conspiracy theory, which stuck. Exactly. I don't know.

42:41.440 --> 42:46.560
 I mean, some conspiracy theories, just because they're popular, doesn't mean they're true.

42:47.200 --> 42:52.480
 And ones that, but it also doesn't mean they're not true. And there's ones that are not very

42:52.480 --> 42:59.920
 popular, that could be true. But that one really stuck. I mean, what's your sense?

42:59.920 --> 43:04.320
 Well, I paid one and a half million dollars for Barry to land at Mina, Arkansas. So I was pretty

43:04.320 --> 43:10.720
 well assured that he couldn't get caught. And I said, well, I can't get caught in Colombia.

43:10.720 --> 43:15.600
 We can't get caught in Nicaragua. I guess we got a license. So we went for it.

43:15.600 --> 43:20.560
 So when you say I can't get caught, just to clarify, there's a sense where this is a safe

43:20.560 --> 43:26.080
 place to land. Yes, like completely safe. So you don't think he was referring to some kind of,

43:27.680 --> 43:36.000
 you know, like my grandfather who fought in World War II would talk about bullets can't hit him.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.520
 So it's almost like believing. He was taking that $50,000 and giving it to somebody.

43:41.520 --> 43:45.040
 To somebody. And Barry was honest. So he wasn't just taking it from me

43:45.040 --> 43:47.760
 because he was making a million dollars and he didn't care for the $50,000.

43:49.520 --> 43:57.280
 Man, taking the story forward, the months leading up to his assassination, what do you

43:57.280 --> 44:02.400
 understand? Why he was assassinated? Who were the players involved?

44:02.400 --> 44:10.240
 Maybe could you have stopped it? Well, I'll tell you, after I saw Reagan's

44:10.240 --> 44:15.920
 face on the television, saying we have the absolute proof, the phone rang and it was Barry.

44:15.920 --> 44:20.080
 I hadn't heard from him in a couple of years. He said, I'm coming out tonight, Roger.

44:21.680 --> 44:28.320
 And oh boy. So he came out and he said, I'll meet you in this French restaurant. I don't

44:28.320 --> 44:32.640
 even know it in Santa Barbara. And I walked in, there's about 20 or 30 people in there.

44:33.280 --> 44:40.160
 And there's all 30, 40 years old women with plastic leather skirts and men in their blue

44:40.160 --> 44:44.080
 jeans. And I looked around and Barry was at the back. He was leaned up, he'd gain weight.

44:44.960 --> 44:50.160
 And I walked up and I said, Barry, you wired. He said, no, that's what I'm not going to talk

44:50.160 --> 44:58.960
 of these DE agents. He said, every one of them. With jeans and skirts. I like it.

45:00.480 --> 45:04.240
 I said, well, Barry, I'm going to sit here and you just talk to me buddy and tell me what's on

45:04.240 --> 45:08.160
 your mind. And you sit there and he just went to talking and he told me about,

45:08.960 --> 45:16.560
 he was left holding the bag and that. What do you mean by that? Like that nobody supported him?

45:16.560 --> 45:22.320
 Well, I think it's somehow or another. He was, and I don't know this. I mean, this is just what

45:22.320 --> 45:29.440
 happened. Putting it all together that he had some CIA buddies that was pretending we're going to

45:29.440 --> 45:35.280
 supply all of our Northwood arms. And with that, you can land cocaine back here by the ton.

45:36.560 --> 45:42.240
 So he's taking his little planes and putting some AK47s and maybe ammunition or whatever

45:42.240 --> 45:49.200
 and takes it down to the Contras against the Communist Party of Nicaragua where we've been

45:49.200 --> 45:57.360
 landed and all of a North was involved in this. So when all that and so his CIA buddies was certainly

45:58.240 --> 46:03.840
 involved, we know they were. And Barry had been in the CIA earlier when he first got out of school.

46:03.840 --> 46:13.600
 So when, as I say, the shit hit the fan, they all fled and left Barry holding the bag.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.360
 The CIA and the DEA.

46:15.360 --> 46:21.440
 Yeah. Not the DEA, the CIA. The DEA wasn't in on it. The CIA was selling that cocaine,

46:21.440 --> 46:30.400
 bringing it in. And just to clarify it, what's Iran Contra scandal? What was the alleged involvement

46:30.400 --> 46:39.680
 of the CIA in using drug trade to fund things? What do you know? What do you think is true?

46:40.800 --> 46:41.680
 What should we know?

46:42.320 --> 46:48.480
 Well, I know. What I know is true that Barry was taking a small amount of arms back to Central

46:48.480 --> 46:56.480
 America and giving them to whoever Oliver North group were. Oliver North was a colonel that got

46:56.480 --> 47:00.240
 implemented and almost brought the government down. And so they said, all right, we're getting the

47:00.240 --> 47:05.760
 guns from Iran and we're taking cocaine to pay for them. And since Congress won't give us money to

47:05.760 --> 47:12.080
 fight this war, we're going to circumvent it. So that was a whole thing.

47:12.080 --> 47:20.800
 So it was a CIA's effort to circumvent the funding mechanisms of government by selling drugs?

47:20.800 --> 47:28.000
 Yes, but it was a handful of renegade CIA agents. It was Barry's friends that was making a load,

47:28.800 --> 47:34.400
 load of money, tons of it come up. If you would like to read the book, The Big White Lie,

47:34.400 --> 47:41.360
 The CIA and the Cracked Cocaine Epidemic, the CIA put, according to this, the book in

47:42.800 --> 47:46.080
 Michael Levine, I didn't remember his name last time I talked,

47:46.080 --> 47:52.960
 wrote that book and he was a head CIA agent, he was a head DEA agent that exposed this.

47:53.760 --> 47:58.160
 And the CIA tried to kill him and he says they put crack cocaine, they developed their,

47:58.160 --> 48:02.640
 their chemists developed crack and they put it in every country, every city in the United States

48:02.640 --> 48:08.480
 in one weekend. So they were bringing it up by the tons and that's for sure and Barry was bringing

48:08.480 --> 48:16.960
 it. Can I ask you a small tangent question? Do you think the public should trust the CIA

48:16.960 --> 48:23.120
 and the DEA? Do you think they're mostly good people that are carrying out a good mission?

48:23.760 --> 48:27.440
 Yes. Because this kind of makes it sound like there's renegade agents that are just

48:28.320 --> 48:33.200
 doing whatever the hell they want and with sometimes no regard for human life.

48:33.200 --> 48:38.000
 Well, that's certainly true, but that's not everybody in there. That's just, sometimes you

48:38.000 --> 48:42.880
 get a few policemen in the department that do these things. I don't believe, I believe that

48:42.880 --> 48:47.600
 our government is good. I think we've got some fools running it. I don't know how we get them

48:47.600 --> 48:53.360
 there, but I don't think I know. Okay, so what was Barry's involvement here?

48:54.320 --> 49:01.360
 So Barry leaned back in that chair and he told me that, you know, he got caught with one and a

49:01.360 --> 49:10.560
 half tons and he bailed it in the runway in Nicaragua and had cameras flashing inside and out

49:11.360 --> 49:15.200
 and he flew it back to Homestead with an agent there and he brought the agent over.

49:17.280 --> 49:21.600
 Jake Jacobson, a really nice fellow. I think he was a crop duster and we'd have got along

49:21.600 --> 49:27.040
 if we'd have been on the right side. And so we sat there and drank Chevy's Regal until I got pie

49:27.040 --> 49:32.960
 eyed and Barry told me about it. He said that he went to see Edwin Meese. He got out on bail

49:32.960 --> 49:38.880
 and he flew his lear jet up to Washington and went in to see the attorney general, Edwin Meese,

49:38.880 --> 49:43.760
 and they run him out of the office. The next day he went back and said, I have absolute proof

49:44.640 --> 49:50.560
 that the CIA is bringing tons of cocaine or they're running tons of cocaine into the United States

49:50.560 --> 49:55.200
 and Edwin Meese put him up with this agent, Jacobson, I believe it was, and they went down and

49:55.200 --> 50:01.520
 got one and a half tons and on the way back they bailed it in and Pablo Escobar and some of the

50:01.520 --> 50:07.200
 other ones in general there in Nicaragua, you can see them toting it from one plane to the other

50:07.200 --> 50:13.760
 in the book called the big, no, Kings of Cocaine. It's got a mention of me too and also the other

50:13.760 --> 50:19.520
 one has a mention of me in it. Said I'm in more files with the DEA than Noriega.

50:19.520 --> 50:28.160
 So who wanted to get rid of Barry? Who wanted to get rid of Barry more, the cartels or the CIA?

50:28.160 --> 50:36.240
 The cartel. But so Barry leaned back and he told me the story and the tears came down between his

50:36.240 --> 50:40.800
 fingers and he put his hands over his eyes and he said, I just couldn't do it, Roger. I just couldn't

50:40.800 --> 50:45.040
 do three live sentences. So I've told him everything. I went to Congress and I've testified before

50:45.040 --> 50:49.600
 Congress and he testified before Congress for all these things that he'd done and he said,

50:49.600 --> 50:55.600
 I told him all about you, but you're under my umbrella. You've got to testify with me

50:55.600 --> 51:01.440
 before grandeur in Miami. And so the guy said, you can come down, the DEA agent said, you can come

51:01.440 --> 51:08.880
 down tomorrow with Murray. First class or I'll take you down in chains. And if you don't testify

51:08.880 --> 51:13.360
 with Barry, the only place you'll ever see your wife and family again is in a federal prison

51:13.360 --> 51:19.600
 visiting room. Was that a difficult conversation? Oh, my guts was just like ice water. I can't

51:19.600 --> 51:26.640
 testify against my friends. I just can't do it. How am I going to do it? I just, I can't work with

51:26.640 --> 51:30.640
 people and he was honest with me. How am I going to testify against him? I can't spend the rest of

51:30.640 --> 51:38.000
 my life in a federal prison. What on earth, what a mess Barry, you've got me into. So is that a

51:38.000 --> 51:46.320
 kind of betrayal there? Yes, but it's still, I wish he left me out of it. I understand him getting

51:47.760 --> 51:53.200
 in such a mess that he told because if the CIA and whoever else was behind him betrayed him,

51:53.200 --> 51:57.280
 then he's going to tell everything. So I says, all right, I'll be in Miami. So Murray and I flew

51:57.280 --> 52:03.520
 down first class and I went to a lawyer, one of the biggest lawyers in Miami and I said, man,

52:03.520 --> 52:10.480
 I am in a mess. This fellow's told everything and I've got to say something, but I'm not a snitch,

52:10.480 --> 52:16.320
 man. I mean, I can, what can I do? And he said, well, being a snitch is like being pregnant. You

52:16.320 --> 52:25.680
 either are or you're not. And he says, I don't represent snitches, but if you want to fight this

52:25.680 --> 52:31.440
 case, I'll do it for $600,000. And boy, my face turned red. Well, I'm not a snitch. He said,

52:31.440 --> 52:34.320
 well, that's what you're talking about. He said, let me tell you something. If you go in there and

52:34.320 --> 52:40.560
 say one thing and sign that paper and you don't tell them everything you know, then they will

52:40.560 --> 52:47.120
 convict you of everything you've ever done and you tell them. So you can't do it. So I said,

52:47.120 --> 52:51.760
 Barry, I'm having trouble with a lawyer. Give it to, I'll go to Murray. I said, all right,

52:51.760 --> 52:56.160
 use my lawyer. And he gave me his card, the lawyer's card. So Murray and I went to the

52:56.160 --> 53:01.360
 festival restaurant that night and Barry and Debbie came in. She was dressed pretty and Barry was.

53:01.360 --> 53:05.120
 And so we was already about finished. So we had dessert together. And I said, Barry, they're

53:05.120 --> 53:09.760
 going to kill you friend. He said, no, it ain't going to kill me. So and so, such and such is

53:09.760 --> 53:14.960
 going and this and other. I said, Barry, they're going to kill you, man. Ain't no, you can't deny it.

53:15.840 --> 53:22.880
 And I didn't tell him I wasn't going to testify. So I hugged his neck. I really like,

53:22.880 --> 53:26.800
 and we fled to Brazil. I took Murray and the children went to Brazil. So you decided there,

53:26.800 --> 53:31.920
 you're not going to testify? I knew. I didn't know what I could do. I talked to a lawyer. I mean,

53:31.920 --> 53:37.760
 I just didn't, I didn't know what, what I could do, but the best in Miami said, what he told me.

53:37.760 --> 53:42.640
 So I had to go. And you went to Brazil. We went to Brazil. Did you have a conversation with anybody

53:42.640 --> 53:49.360
 at the cartel? I mean, that's such an interesting moment that tests the man's character.

53:49.360 --> 53:59.120
 To not snitch. And did you have a conversation with anybody? No. Pablo with about it?

53:59.120 --> 54:03.520
 No, not at all. So it's just understood. I just didn't, couldn't do it.

54:04.240 --> 54:09.520
 But how many men like you are there? Not many. I had all my friends testified against me. I had

54:09.520 --> 54:13.920
 11 friends and every one of them put their finger up. Roger did it. And I was facing life,

54:13.920 --> 54:17.200
 continuing to criminal enterprise. And still you couldn't do it? I just couldn't do it.

54:17.200 --> 54:22.240
 Do you ever get respect from the cartels for that, from the people in the cartel?

54:22.240 --> 54:26.000
 Oh, there was all the time I got back and stuff. They owe me money and I can't get it.

54:26.880 --> 54:30.480
 So. Well, that's about money. I just mean about human beings.

54:30.480 --> 54:36.880
 Oh, I think so. I mean, I've been back down there and I've been welcome. I have my contact and

54:37.440 --> 54:41.280
 when I was in Brazil, I was trying to get this money. They owe me three and a half million dollars.

54:41.280 --> 54:46.400
 So I called up there and he was going to pay me. Oh, I got 600,000 today and I'll get you some more

54:46.400 --> 54:51.840
 tomorrow. And then the next week I called, Hey, hey, got great news, great news. Barry Seales

54:51.840 --> 54:58.560
 been killed. So, oh no. And I went back to the hotel. We was up in northern part of Brazil.

54:59.200 --> 55:07.600
 And where was it money? Yeah. And so went back and I told Mari and Miriam and they cried and I

55:07.600 --> 55:13.280
 cried. I really cried. How is that great news from the cartel perspective? Well, now there's no case

55:13.280 --> 55:18.880
 against me and him and them. Do you know who killed them? Yes. I'll tell you about that story.

55:20.000 --> 55:26.480
 On the first load I did, I landed in a banana plantation and it was raining and it was a muddy

55:26.480 --> 55:32.080
 stripped clay and they put the 300 kilos of cocaine in it. The ugliest man you could imagine,

55:32.080 --> 55:37.200
 named Ronaldo. Got in there with a Mac 10 and he was making sure I took it to Louisiana.

55:37.200 --> 55:43.040
 So, this is many years before? Yeah, a couple of years before. So anyway, he,

55:45.120 --> 55:50.880
 we took off and the mud got up in the wheel well, so thick until the wheels wouldn't come up.

55:51.520 --> 55:55.040
 Well, I'm going 200 miles an hour instead of 300 miles while the wheel's coming down.

55:55.600 --> 56:00.640
 Well, I can't go back there. If I do, I'm going to be in the same situation until the sun dries

56:00.640 --> 56:06.800
 it out in a few days. And so, but in Belize, I had a runway that had been used for $10,000,

56:06.800 --> 56:13.120
 used to refuel. So, I told the guy, listen, we got to land in Belize to refuel. No, no, no,

56:13.120 --> 56:17.760
 he put the Mac 10 and I'll shoot you. Go ahead, fool. You're going to die too. So,

56:18.400 --> 56:25.040
 it was in a term. He wasn't just ugly, he was also angry. He was a bad, bad killer. So,

56:25.760 --> 56:32.000
 he's the one to actually kill Barry, the one that went up on the first load with me

56:32.000 --> 56:37.360
 and Ronaldo and he's doing life. So, he's just a killer. Yeah.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.760
 He's doing life in Louisiana. I wonder who, is it known, who made that decision?

56:44.480 --> 56:49.680
 The younger Ochoa brother, I understand Fabio, was the one paid for the hit.

56:50.640 --> 56:53.280
 I don't know that, but that's what I've heard and it probably sounds about right.

56:53.840 --> 57:00.000
 He's done in Jessup, Georgia, doing a long, long time. I think he's about to get out. He's been in

57:00.000 --> 57:04.480
 30 years or whatever. The movie American Made.

57:07.360 --> 57:10.000
 What do you think that movie got, right? What did it get wrong?

57:11.040 --> 57:20.480
 Almost everything wrong. It was disgustingly wrong. Okay, which parts? Can you, can you,

57:22.080 --> 57:25.920
 can you maybe elaborate? It's about Barry Seal and it just didn't even,

57:25.920 --> 57:30.880
 it was nothing. Whoever wrote it had no idea who Barry Seal was. They sat in a rocking chair

57:30.880 --> 57:38.160
 and just tried to think of what, what's some baby bashing drug dealer doing. And it's just like,

57:38.160 --> 57:42.000
 God, just, you just don't have any idea of the spirit of the man.

57:42.560 --> 57:47.440
 So, they wanted just to try to tell a fun story without actually studying the story.

57:47.440 --> 57:51.600
 They didn't know him. They just had no idea. And Barry was such a nice person,

57:51.600 --> 57:56.000
 such a really nice gentleman person. They talked to you or no? No.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.480
 The people that made the movie. And I see all these people telling about

58:00.480 --> 58:04.320
 Barry and never met him. They telling all about him. I think that's just ridiculous.

58:04.320 --> 58:09.120
 Yeah. And for one thing before his character coming out of horror houses and all that,

58:09.120 --> 58:14.240
 that was just like ugly. And then down in Columbia, putting a gun to his head,

58:14.240 --> 58:19.680
 going to take his sunglasses, and then he put $25,000 million worth of cocaine on his plane.

58:19.680 --> 58:22.400
 And then they're going to bet $100 that you don't have enough room to take off.

58:24.720 --> 58:30.560
 That's just insane. I mean, just, just the whole thing. And then he's talking to the DEA agents

58:30.560 --> 58:35.280
 when he's coming up. You don't know what frequency they own. How he's got five planes

58:35.280 --> 58:40.160
 and they all split when the DEA comes out. These are just somebody just fantasy.

58:40.960 --> 58:45.600
 But those are like, those are details of the man, details of the story. Is there some big,

58:45.600 --> 58:51.360
 profound things they missed about just this whole period about that's something that's

58:51.360 --> 58:59.120
 really important to you that was missed? Yes. They just try to sensationalize on

58:59.120 --> 59:02.400
 little things that people remember. And it's just not true. It's just,

59:02.400 --> 59:09.040
 it was just like a business deal and good people and good airplanes and good flying. And

59:09.040 --> 59:17.360
 it was like a good watch it was made. It just clicked and it just went on. And they missed

59:17.360 --> 59:21.760
 all that. They tried to make it sound like it's something very ugly. Do you think it was a story

59:21.760 --> 59:27.200
 that could have been told way better and still be a hell of a good story? Yes. Well, there's a,

59:28.240 --> 59:34.080
 there's a series called Chernobyl done by HBO. And because I have sort of family connected to

59:34.080 --> 59:40.960
 that period, you know, they did an incredible job of being historically accurate and only not

59:40.960 --> 59:46.880
 being historically accurate when it helped the story, only in those rare cases when they on purpose

59:46.880 --> 59:52.960
 left the story to, to make it easier for people to understand. But it was, it was still somehow

59:52.960 --> 59:59.280
 accurate. And even though all the actors were British actors speaking English with a British

59:59.280 --> 1:00:06.480
 accent, it was still somehow accurate. Like they captured the spirit. Yes. So it was historically

1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:11.040
 accurate and the spirit was captured. That was one of the most incredible like series I've ever

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:19.200
 seen. It convinced me that the movie was made by non Russians. It convinced me that if you

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:24.240
 really care about a story, you don't have to have been brought up in it. You don't even need to speak

1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:29.920
 the language. If you're truly a scholar of it, if you talk to a lot of people, if you learn, if you

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:35.040
 just pour your heart and soul into it, you can create something really special. And so your

1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:39.680
 son says you could do that with you, with the, with the story with this period of time. Oh,

1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:44.960
 yes. There was a, it was a story that needs to be told. It needs to be told in the correct way,

1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:52.640
 not like we're trying to bash a certain angle. Yeah. Well, if Netflix or HBO are watching this,

1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:58.400
 you need to tell the story of Roger Reeves in my opinion. There you go. This is a young picture

1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:04.640
 of you. Yeah. There you go. That's from National Geographic. Jorge Archoa, Pablo Escobar, it's you,

1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:12.960
 Roger and Barry. Yeah. Smuggler, a memoir. Yeah, I really do hope that they make a movie of this one.

1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:20.960
 There's a movie called Blow that tells the story of George Young, Boston George. Did you know George

1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:25.840
 Young? That's one way to ask it. The other is, what do you think of the movie, Blow? I didn't

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:32.880
 know George Young, but it was a wonderful movie. Absolutely. It captured it. It did. Yes, it did.

1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:37.760
 That's the way it should be. So he was a little bit before your time? Exactly the same time.

1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:43.760
 Exactly the same time. He was using stewardesses to fly the marijuana out of Manhattan Beach. And

1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:49.440
 I was on the fire department in Redondo Beach, 10 miles away, flying it up, sending it back.

1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:54.560
 Somebody was sending it back. He might have been sending it back. But he didn't have near the excitement

1:01:54.560 --> 1:02:00.880
 that I did. I was shot down twice. I escaped from five different prisons. I was tortured almost

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:05.280
 to death in the Mexican prison. So he didn't have all that fun that I had. Funding quotes. Yeah.

1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:12.880
 So yours is a heck of a fun adventure. Just to linger on a little bit. So Johnny Depp plays

1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:20.400
 George and Ray Liotta plays his father. And there's the son, father kind of scene at the end.

1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:31.200
 I don't know. It's heartbreaking. Like that scene paints a picture of a life that could have been

1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:42.720
 had if none of this wild drug smuggling happened. I don't usually, I mean, I don't, I almost, I

1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:49.680
 really never get like teary eyed in a movie. But that got me. It's almost like

1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:55.120
 confronting at the end of your life, what your life could have been with your father.

1:02:55.120 --> 1:03:02.480
 And the way he calls him, Georgie. It, like you fucked up, Georgie.

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:09.360
 Yes. I did too. I really, really did. Murray waited for me all those years and the children

1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:15.040
 raised him without me, pissed at me in prisons all over the world. It's unbelievable. It's just

1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:17.520
 nothing's worth that kind of money. Yeah.

1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:26.320
 Can you tell the story of when you were tortured nearly to death in a Mexican prison?

1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:30.720
 I sure can. And I'm smiling, but it was nothing to smile about, I can tell you.

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:37.680
 I was, I was in a poo and a gentleman came over and shook hands with me and put handcuffs on me.

1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:41.920
 And I thought, what in the world? That was not one of the nice hotels. And they put me in a,

1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:48.160
 in a jail cell and I sat there and all the trunks and the thieves and stuff kept coming in and

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:53.840
 they had a bucket near overrun. And I said, I remember like 18 people in a room about 12,

1:03:53.840 --> 1:04:00.320
 12 foot square. Oh, it was hot. And I thought, somebody's got to come get me. This, this ain't

1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:06.480
 real. I hadn't done anything. It's like, it was a pilot come to see me up in Hermosillo and he

1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:10.000
 stopped and he made a mistake and went to the international run. We instead of where he was

1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:18.000
 supposed to go. And he had my phony name in his pocket. So they got me. So they said I was a drug

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:23.680
 smoker. So after about three days, they put me back into the, into the back and it was a torture

1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:27.920
 place. And they put me in a little cell. Like, I guess it wasn't hard. It wasn't six feet. It must

1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:34.160
 been about five feet square and about 12 feet high. And it was June, the end of June. And it

1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:41.920
 was hot. I mean hot. And they left me in there for, I guess, a few days. You didn't know they,

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:48.240
 so every once while they come drag me out and first off, they put my head under water

1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:52.800
 and it had seltzer in it or some kind. And I took one whiff of that and three or four of them

1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:58.480
 couldn't hold me down. So then I learned it just before you have to breathe, tear loose like that

1:04:58.480 --> 1:05:04.560
 and they'll let you up. And that was the first treatment. And then they started beating me.

1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:09.360
 And they beat me blackjack and rubber hose until I was black and blue and yellow from the bottom

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:13.920
 of my feet to my head. What did they want from me? They wanted me to sign a confession that I was a

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:19.520
 drug smoker. And they put the papers under your, under your nose. This is all over a fuel sign.

1:05:19.520 --> 1:05:25.280
 Well, I knew if you signed, you got six years. I wasn't going to sign. I wasn't going to sign.

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:30.240
 But they didn't want you to snitch on anybody. They just wanted me to sign that paper.

1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:31.040
 And you still didn't.

1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:41.520
 About to. I ain't beating that bad. So anyhow, it's coming to the good part. So then

1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:46.000
 they come and they take me out. I'm bug naked and they bend me over and they have things to

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:49.760
 pull you. That change. Click, click, click, click, click. And they bent me over and they

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:57.520
 put butter on my bum. And they convinced to put hot chili pepper up there. And that stuff was bad.

1:05:57.520 --> 1:06:03.120
 I mean, it was red hot. And that was, that was awful.

1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:06.720
 And still, still.

1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:07.840
 Just awful.

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:08.960
 Yeah, but still you didn't.

1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:13.280
 I didn't think about it. I ain't going to. I guess if I'd have known he's going to kill me,

1:06:13.280 --> 1:06:19.600
 I wouldn't have done it. But I, but I wasn't about, you get hurt bad enough, you'll pass out. So

1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:23.760
 I didn't pass out. So I was all right. So then the last thing they did was,

1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:29.600
 they brought a dead man in there and he was wrapped, he was frozen. He was wrapped in newspaper,

1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:34.640
 little strips about a half inch wide, just like a mummy. And he was frozen and they hung him on

1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:42.160
 the wall with a meat hook. And you next son of a bitch, you next. And so he's sitting there like

1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:48.400
 this. And as he starts to thaw out, which is pretty quick, it looks like he's crying. And it

1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:53.920
 looks like he's peeing. And the papers start unraveling on him. And the formaldehyde puddles

1:06:53.920 --> 1:07:00.800
 on the floor. What a smell that rotten insides and the formaldehyde. And there was a little

1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:06.400
 space. It wasn't even a half inch high under the door. And I lay on that filthy floor of my cheek

1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:10.000
 and put my lips right up under that door and was sucking that fresh air. And I went to sleep

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:15.840
 after some time. And I knew where Walt Disney gets his ideas. I saw white pink

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:22.240
 pigs with wings on them, all kinds of stuff lying around. So when I woke up, I didn't know which

1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:27.760
 was real and which was the nightmare. It took me a minute to figure out where I was and what was

1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:35.520
 going on. How did you stay mentally strong through that time? Like what? I don't know that I did.

1:07:35.520 --> 1:07:41.680
 I was mentally strong. So I was just like I am now. Stubborn. I mean, you could be that man.

1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:47.920
 They could have killed you. Yes, they could have. So what gave you hope? Did you have hope? Yeah.

1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:51.360
 You're just a stubborn son of a bitch. I think some of both of it. And I think

1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:54.480
 they aren't going to keep you here forever. You know, you're going to get out into the

1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:58.320
 prison or they're going to let you go or something. If you sign that paper, you ain't going nowhere.

1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:06.160
 And I want to go home. I had got shot down a few weeks before that. I got shot from my

1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:12.400
 disguise. 80 bullet holes through the plane, killed a fellow on the ground, shot the leg nearly off

1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:16.240
 the man. What was this? In that little place of Peche Lingi. And they were shooting you from

1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:21.600
 the ground. Yeah, yeah. All right. A little 900 foot strip there at Peche Lingi, a poor village

1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:26.480
 with starving donkeys. And that's where they, I'd give them $17,000 for loading. And I'd go

1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:31.680
 over on the highway and load. Well, on day 13, I did a load every day for 13 days. They had a

1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:37.200
 bunch of marijuana pretty good piled up. I was going load a day. And on the day 13,

1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:43.760
 I had that little warning sign going off in my stomach. Uh oh, don't do it. But I asked this

1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:50.320
 Joaquin, oh, we had the federalist paid off nowhere he were. So I spent the night in a hammock and

1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:56.080
 walked down to the airplane just as it didn't daylight. And 10 or 12 men walked with me and

1:08:56.080 --> 1:09:00.880
 Pedro got in. I brushed my teeth in the little stream. It was about foot deep, little river

1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:06.880
 coming through there. Got in the airplane and I fired her up, bam, blah, blah. And bam,

1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:14.480
 I thought a tire blew out. I looked over and see if it was, and it still ain't dawned on me. And

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:19.520
 Pedro was yelling, police see her, police see her, Roger, police see her. Well, it dawned on me.

1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:24.960
 And I shoved it, the throttle to the firewall. And I only had. So that was a bullet?

1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:30.320
 Yeah, somebody, there's off to the side, they'd shot, they'd shot, just a warning like, get

1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:35.520
 out, stop. We're going to rob you, whatever it is. That's what they do. They're just taking the plane

1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:41.120
 and me and put me in prison, old thing. So, but I even though I had papers. So I just shoved it

1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:44.880
 to the firewall and there wasn't enough room to take off on that strip. And there's, half of it

1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:50.080
 was behind me or some of it was behind me. And so just at the end, I'm just like, I think that

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:56.160
 thing stalls at about 50 miles an hour. Just turning 50 and I just pulled it right up and

1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:01.600
 put the flaps on. And as I pulled off the ground, they opened up on both sides of me with machine

1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:07.760
 guns and they riddled that airplane. I mean, the windshield came out, I got hit three times.

1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:16.320
 Do you like your body? Yeah. And I didn't know I was hit. I mean, it was just the gasoline,

1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:21.360
 the gasoline just pouring in. The world turned yellow. I must have went into shock. So it just

1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:27.360
 stopped in slow motion. And one bullet hit the strut right by my head and it just,

1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:32.720
 parts of that bullet just went all over me. I would just look like I'd been peppered,

1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:38.320
 which would lead. And the gasoline was just pouring in. I mean, just pouring in where

1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:43.600
 they'd shot the wing up above and windshields gone. I mean, I didn't, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:49.920
 but it was just like a hail storm. So I... The airplanes, the stall or no?

1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:55.200
 I was in a stall anyway. And I didn't realize it. And I guess you wouldn't unless you trained for it.

1:10:55.200 --> 1:11:01.200
 But when you in a stall, the elevator is kind of flappy. And I didn't realize it. At the time,

1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:06.480
 I thought they had shot the elevator cable in too. So I thought, oh God. So I just reached over and

1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:11.600
 switched it off, switched it off, pulled the mixture, pulled everything. And in the river,

1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:16.880
 there was rocks about as big as this table. And they were like the turtle back all the way up until

1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:21.440
 there was a waterfall. There's quite a pretty place. And I crashed straight on to it. I thought,

1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:26.480
 if I get those rocks, and when I did the first time I hit, the wings came off and then it bounced.

1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:30.480
 And the next time the nose came out and came under the plane. And I'm sitting there, I must

1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:34.640
 have been knocked unconscious because Pedro was shaking me, come on, Roger, come on, Roger.

1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:40.080
 So I stepped out into the water. And here comes these full federales still shooting at us.

1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:45.680
 And I'm bullied that two hit the airplane. And I kept a nine millimeter browning high power,

1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:53.600
 taped to the top of the radio in case I ever needed it. So you didn't want it in the airplane.

1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:56.880
 So I just, it was just handy. You just lay in there. So I took and popped a few caps out of them.

1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:04.160
 And they ran into the rocks. So we took off running. And then I looked and Pedro's

1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:08.800
 foot nearly shot off. They'd shot him on one side of the ankle and it just blown out the other side.

1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:13.200
 And it wasn't even hardly bleeding, the shock of it. So I took my t shirt off and

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:17.680
 gripped it and tied it best I could. But you had still bullets in you. So like you could still run.

1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:23.360
 I shot the top of my toenail off. I shot across my head and my kneecap. So I would just nicked.

1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:30.000
 It was very painful later on. But right that time it was just hot. And there's a bullet

1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:36.000
 still in my foot from it, a piece of a bullet, a good sized slug. So we went on up the mountain

1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:40.720
 through the cactus and just running. Just going, I want to go down. No, no, the federales are

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:46.400
 going the easy way. Let's go this young fellow. And we came to an old donkey. She must have been 30

1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:52.480
 years old, long and way back, long hair on her. Charlotte, Charlotte. And he pitted the donkey

1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:56.880
 and we jumped on. And we rode for seven. Like an actual donkey? A donkey. They were donkeys all

1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:01.760
 over the place. I knew that one from the village. And so we rode seven miles, two of us on the

1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:08.240
 donkey with no bridle, no saddle, nothing. And we came to a little man plowing a little horse

1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:13.280
 and a little ox. Both of them spotted. The ox was, the yoke was across her back this way.

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:17.120
 And he's plowing with a little plow amongst stumps. It was like one of these people clearing a

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:21.760
 little piece of land. And he had a little house there. And so we went into his house and his wife

1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:28.080
 and his daughter, they put like cloth over my wounds and on Pedro's. It was terrible.

1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:34.640
 And they put diesel oil on it to keep the flies off. So I'm covered in diesel oil. So

1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:40.560
 the man left and he was going all day. And then about dark, he showed up about 15 or 20

1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:45.680
 horses and mule showed up in the yard, walking fast. And the doctor got out. He said, I'm Dr.

1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:50.880
 Benjamin Soso with Red Cross. And he worked on my foot and he worked on Pedro. He gave us a shot

1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:56.000
 of morphine and tetanus shots. And he said, you got to get to hospital. He said, Pedro,

1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:01.120
 die if he don't get to hospital. And he said, they were looking for American pilots and shot down.

1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:07.200
 They think he's dead. There was a lot of blood in that airplane. And so they rode, I don't know how

1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:11.360
 far we rode, but we rode miles and we'd come to a road and there was a big truck. And it was loaded

1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:17.760
 with corn in the ear. And the duck holes in that corn put us in it and covered us up. And the road

1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:22.880
 was rough. And every time we'd hit a dirt road, that corn would cover me up. They'd scratch my face

1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:28.880
 out again. When they came to the highway, we went into a house and they got me some clothes and mine

1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:34.880
 was messed up. And a white basin and they must have brought 20 jugs of water at different times.

1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:39.680
 I kept washing and washing my foot too. All the blood and the crud got off of me and put on those

1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:44.880
 clothes. And somebody went to, they said, you can't go north of Rhodes Block. They're looking for the

1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:52.320
 pilot. So you got to go south. So they found a taxi in Mazatlan. And it was a rather new taxi

1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:57.280
 and the fellow would take me to Guadalajara, which was, I don't know, seven, eight hours south.

1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:02.480
 So we got in that taxi and they propped me up with sheets and blankets and pillows in the back

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:09.600
 seat and give me these great big white paint pills. And I was quite content. Then I was shot down

1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:18.000
 in, shot down in Columbia also. What, can you tell that story? I sure can. All right. I was, I went

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:24.640
 down for Lodum, Lodum, marijuana. And we got to the place and we got there too early and the gorillas

1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:29.120
 screamed, you got to get out of here, you got to get out of here. And so we went back to the

1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:38.400
 place where we staged from and refueled. I had a beautiful DC3, carry three tons. And so while

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:46.400
 I was waiting, I ate something for lunch and I went around behind the house. We refueled a plane

1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:50.400
 up. I had to wait until late in the afternoon. They wanted me to come just at dark so the military

1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:58.000
 planes couldn't see me on their strip. So I'm leaning in the hammock asleep and I hear this

1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:04.160
 terrible roar. And I looked right up through the trees and at the ass end of two military jets

1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:09.520
 going straight up. And they do a dive over and they came back down the strip in front of that

1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:13.760
 airplane and they just tear it up with 50 caliber machine guns. They just showin out.

1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:19.520
 So I run for the airplane. I just give that guy $80,000 and he ran for the truck and all

1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:24.320
 the rest of them ran for the truck. I should have ran with my money. But I didn't. I ran

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:29.600
 for the airplane and the copilot got in and the name was Al. He got in with me and two

1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:34.240
 fellas got in the back. We had drums of fuel in there to refuel when we got down to the gorillas.

1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:41.920
 So we took off and I couldn't get the gear up because I'd taken off in such a hurry these

1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:46.560
 pins in the struts of a DC3 and with big flags on them and you have to take them up so that

1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:51.840
 the plane won't come up. So these jets swarmed on me and they tried to get me to go. They kept

1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:56.000
 telling me which way to go and the pilot would be just as close as just right over there. I could

1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:01.040
 see him. I just held up the old hippie piece. I didn't think they would shoot. I really didn't.

1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:07.920
 Nobody had shot before. So I kept flying out and I kept getting slower and slower and they

1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:13.440
 kept slowing down, down, down and the black smoke rolling and then they started shooting up under

1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:18.320
 me. Boom, boom, boom, boom with them 20 millimeter counters and then the tracers just going up.

1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:22.720
 They looked like they're curving up from me. I was and I pushed the nose over so they couldn't

1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:29.200
 get under me and later on I heard they thought I tried to ram them. So one of them went for fuel

1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:35.920
 and I kept on going and the one just tore the left wing tip up with a 50 caliber and then he

1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:40.960
 come back again and shot the tail up. He's warning me and I tell the fellow and I says,

1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:45.680
 you know, if you bring me enough water, I believe I can fly this thing. My mouth got quite dry.

1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:57.360
 So I went on and I landed on a big pasture and it was huge pasture and it was rougher than it

1:17:57.360 --> 1:18:01.760
 looked and the wings just flapped and I come to a stop and jumped out and pulled those tabs out and

1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:06.960
 threw them on the ground so I could get my gear up and I understand that during the 1980 World

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:12.560
 Series baseball game that it says American DC three has just been shot down by American jets,

1:18:12.560 --> 1:18:17.440
 by Colombian jets. You know, it's the first plane shot down on Reagan's new war on drugs

1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:22.080
 but he's up. He's up in a way, ladies and gentlemen, we'll keep you posted. So I took off again

1:18:22.080 --> 1:18:27.440
 and I went into a thunderstorm and they came close to the mountains. So I spiraled up and

1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:34.000
 every time I'd come out that jet was there boom, boom, boom and I dove back into that storm and

1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:38.880
 boom, boom, boom in there and at 20,000 feet I started icing up. So I went out one last time

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:43.280
 and he was right there waiting. He had me on the radar. So I went back in and I kicked it over and

1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:49.360
 put it into a spin and went straight down to 2,000 feet and come out under it and I was flying along

1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:56.480
 the Guadalajara River and there was a 20 feet above the water. It looked like a pasture. It was

1:18:56.480 --> 1:19:02.400
 just grass and I made several runs to tear the grass down and it looked like it felt hard.

1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:06.880
 That little DC three weighs 30,000 pounds and I put it down on the fifth run. I said,

1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:12.560
 all right, we're going to land now. So you flew like close. I put the wheels down.

1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:16.560
 Oh, you put the wheels down without landing. And just so I'm making it run.

1:19:16.560 --> 1:19:25.600
 So you're being tracked by a jet. He's just trying to, well, before that,

1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:31.920
 I'm just retelling this story how insane it is. So he's trying to shoot you down

1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:38.800
 and there's a thunderstorm that you're escaping into and then you do a spin down to what,

1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:44.480
 2,000 feet, whatever you said, like somehow escaping all of this and then you try to land on

1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:55.120
 the pasture on a giant heavy plane that carries three tons by touching down five or six times

1:19:55.120 --> 1:20:00.480
 to make a landing strip for yourself. Yeah, the grass is three or four feet.

1:20:01.520 --> 1:20:06.160
 So it looked really good after a few times. So then just before it stopped, I said, I'll take

1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:10.160
 your feet off the brakes. He said, I don't have my feet on the brakes. Well, I knew I had broken

1:20:10.160 --> 1:20:15.440
 through the crust and I put full power on, but it didn't. That old big plane just come on down

1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:21.680
 and it just did a head. As it came to a stop, it did a headstand 90 degrees to the ground.

1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:27.760
 And the engines held it up and the nose and all just crushed in right on it. We fell between

1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:32.640
 the two seats to keep from getting killed. And when it come to a stop, all that fuel was pouring

1:20:32.640 --> 1:20:36.960
 out on those hot engines and there's a escape hatch at the top. I just stepped out, took my

1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:44.160
 suitcase with me. Was there fire? No fire. Left the plane there and the two guys, it was in the

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:50.160
 back when I broke his thumb and it was with the barrels. And they had to tie gas hoses together

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:56.640
 to shimmy down to get out. Yeah. That's an incredible story. Well, let me just tell you,

1:20:56.640 --> 1:21:00.960
 they had a little bit more to it. I learned to fly with the idea of being a missionary aviation

1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:06.080
 fellowship pilot. Fly the missionaries in and out of the jungle. Well, I went 11 days through that

1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:10.480
 jungle. The rest of them went on down the road and got, went to prison. I said, I'll crawl on my

1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:15.680
 village six months in year a year, eating snakes before I'm going down the road. So I went in there

1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:21.760
 and I was 11 days in the jungle and I finally came to his place and it had airplanes. I kept

1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:25.680
 asking the Indian, don't just tie avions. I want to steal an airplane and get out of there.

1:21:26.400 --> 1:21:31.120
 And when I came to the place, I asked, what is this place? Lovely place. It looked like

1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:37.600
 Honolulu and World War II was a runway there. I said, you don't know. This is Loma Linda,

1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:42.560
 headquarters for missionary aviation fellowship for the Amazon. And they flew me out.

1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:51.920
 You escaped from prison five times? So what, what stands out to you as the most difficult

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:55.280
 or miraculous escape in the bunch?

1:21:55.280 --> 1:22:02.160
 The most black miraculous was when I was in the courtroom in Spain. I think I was,

1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:07.360
 I was on the third floor of real high and I ran across the courtroom, handcuffed, kicked the window

1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:11.680
 out and I looked down and it was above the palm trees. I thought there might be a power line

1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:16.000
 or something I could grab on as I went down. There was nothing and there was a car parked

1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:21.920
 station wagon on the side. He jumped out? I jumped out from 31 feet on top of that car

1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:26.400
 and it exploded in the street. The windshield went over three or four cars.

1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:30.160
 It looked like snow going up and I looked like Donald Duck with the thing coming

1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:31.840
 and handcuffed and I got out.

1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:33.200
 And it kept running?

1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:36.720
 Yeah, it kept running. They ran me down to and hit me in the back. I still got a dead spot.

1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:41.120
 My back where the policeman hit me with a shotgun and they brought me back.

1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:45.600
 Murray was there and he was saying, your husband is crazy. That was spectacular,

1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:50.480
 but I escaped from Lubeck, maximum security prison and I cut out of there and got out.

1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:53.280
 That was a miraculous escape. And Lubeck, Germany.

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:55.760
 What was that escape like?

1:22:56.320 --> 1:23:00.880
 I was there and it was going to extradot me back to the United States where I still had all

1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:09.440
 these charges and 25 years special parole. And I was cleaning the lawyer's vesting room

1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:16.800
 and on it was bars that looked like a piano notes or this way to make it pretty,

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:24.000
 but there was a little bit. So I got a rope from a guy where they made boats in there and I had

1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:28.800
 20 minutes. So I went in there and I wrapped it around and I put a broom handle in it that was

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:33.440
 cut off and wrapped it around until they pulled the bars together on that side and then I pulled

1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:37.920
 them together on the other side. But that only put me in inside the prison yard where the

1:23:38.800 --> 1:23:44.480
 soccer equipment was kept, but they were putting new windows on one side of the prison and they

1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:49.280
 had it scaffolded up to the fourth floor. So there was a little recess there and there was guard

1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:56.400
 towers ever 100 feet or so. I mean they were shooting kill you. So I got behind that and

1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:00.480
 climbed up holding to the bricks on one hand and the scaffolding on the other and went to the roof.

1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:04.400
 I lost my shirt and most of my clothes going through the window. I got all the skin off of me.

1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:08.800
 I thought I was going to die and I was trying to go sideways like this and finally I got a grip

1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:14.160
 and the bars let me through and took all the skin off of me. So I got up on that roof and I

1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:17.520
 asked my, and I just lay there trying to catch my breath. I didn't bring my inhaler.

1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:25.120
 With blood everywhere. Oh, I would bloody, yes. And so I got down to the end and on the end,

1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:31.760
 the reason I did it, they were putting a new wall again around the prison to make it larger.

1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:38.160
 And they had taken all the wire off above the sally port where they could join the two walls

1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:45.440
 together and I saw that when I came up. And there was a guard, a half of like a dome sticking out

1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:49.040
 of that brick building where there's a guard there with a gun and he'd kill you. And I mean,

1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:53.040
 he was made, he was surely trained to kill you. And we had some bad people in that place.

1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:58.960
 So I lay up a one floor above it and I saw a guard and his wife come with a double umbrella.

1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:04.480
 It was just pouring down the rain. And here I am without a shirt on, bloody. And he had a little

1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:08.480
 boy, she had a little boy with him under that double umbrella and I knew him and when he'd come

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:15.120
 and she started back from the sally port, I hit the top of that guard tower, bam, with both feet.

1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:18.640
 And I jumped, I guess it's three more floors. I jumped, there was a pile of sand,

1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:23.200
 like a cone where they were digging it there. And I hit that in my feet,

1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:28.640
 buried up to the knees, but I didn't fall. And I ran straight towards her. So he couldn't shoot me.

1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:34.800
 And then I went around some bushes and went downhill. And then I heard bam, bam, bam, bam,

1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:39.120
 bam, behind me. And I looked and that fool woman was in a big old car and she was knocking down

1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:45.040
 the parking meters behind me. She was trying to run over me. And I ran behind a car and she tore

1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:50.320
 the fender off of her car, trying and yelling, yeah, yeah, yeah. And a terrible evil looking face

1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:55.920
 at me screaming at me and the sirens going off in the prison. And there was a fence there,

1:25:55.920 --> 1:26:01.840
 a wall. And I jumped up on it to jump over and it had glass embedded. And I cut my hands and my arms

1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:07.840
 all up getting over that. And I hit the ground on the other side. And it was that muck where

1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:13.200
 some farmer had dug it. I dug in there and Mari had slipped me $200 into prison. And I had that in

1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:18.080
 my shoe and I lost my shoes in that muck. Anyway, I got out there and got to Holland. Really heck

1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:24.800
 of a story how I could do that. What was prison like, whether it's Germany or whether it's Australia?

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:30.720
 What were some of the darker moments in prison? The United States prisons are awful, awful,

1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:35.600
 evil places now. And just really, there's nothing nice about them. There's the guards.

1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:42.560
 In LA. And everyone I went to. It seemed like to further east, I went to Oklahoma and it was

1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:48.880
 nicer. But all of them on the West Coast, they was hatred there. And they got really stupid people

1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:56.320
 hired just incredibly. Or hatred by the guards and the inmates. Like, I speak Spanish and I walked

1:26:56.320 --> 1:27:02.800
 into the Spanish TV room and it was in your know, you can't come in here. And I walked across to

1:27:02.800 --> 1:27:09.200
 the black, hey, get out of here. White boy. It was just like, what? Man, I like all you people,

1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:12.960
 you know? Yeah. And so I walked down to the white people and said, show us your paperwork.

1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:18.800
 You can't come in here until you show your paperwork. We don't let snitches and homosexuals

1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:25.280
 and all this sort of stuff in here. So they have, so it's just like, man, I don't want to be in here.

1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:29.680
 I mean, it sounds absurd, but you're saying like the basic humanity is gone.

1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:35.600
 Completely. Completely in the guards. It was just like, come here, Reeves. And I woke up to him,

1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:39.760
 get the fuck out of my face. He sticks his chin out like for me to break his jaw.

1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:45.280
 Like, what in the world, man? I love people. And it just.

1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:53.440
 Yeah. You got this joy to you. You have a joyful nature. And it didn't seem like that broke you.

1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:58.000
 Not a bit. How did you persevere? Did you know, I didn't even think I persevered,

1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:04.800
 but I tried to enjoy my life wherever I am every day. I do. I ran every day and like I told you,

1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:10.000
 hey, why do you run so, Roger? I said, to help me suffer these fools. And I played a game of chess

1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:16.400
 every day almost of my life in there. And I read two books a week and I talked with people, storytellers,

1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:20.720
 guys were coming to tell us another story, Roger. Give us a poem. Tell us one you never told us

1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:26.720
 before. And so it was just nice. A lot of them have original boys. They picked their country music and

1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:34.560
 it was all right. Red Morgan Freeman's character in the Shawshank Redemption says the following,

1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:40.720
 these walls are funny. First, you hate them, then you get used to them. Enough time passes you get,

1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:48.800
 so you depend on them. That's institutionalized. Is there true to that? 100%. I get to see the walls,

1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:54.480
 except when I was playing on escaping. In Shawshank Redemption, he spent so many years in prison

1:28:55.440 --> 1:29:01.920
 that he almost didn't know what to do with himself once he left, once he was a free man.

1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:12.480
 That's the, you get so used to the system, the rituals, having to follow orders,

1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:18.880
 even being treated poorly, all those kinds of things that you become dependent on.

1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:26.960
 Well, down in Australia, I spent the first a little over a year in the shoe. It was like,

1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:34.640
 did you see the movie, The Silence of the Lambs? Thank you. And he said, I had five or six cars

1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:39.120
 looking at me with one way mirror. And that's whenever I thought I might never get out. I got

1:29:39.120 --> 1:29:48.160
 a life sentence. I had all this time waiting here in Germany. And so they had a computer in there,

1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:52.240
 but it didn't have a program on it. And I wrote, so I just started writing these little stories

1:29:52.240 --> 1:29:57.680
 of stuff I did in my life. And I wrote one line, and I wrote a million words with them looking

1:29:57.680 --> 1:30:01.920
 at me. So it was after a year, they let me out. It wasn't long before they put me in a place called

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:09.760
 self care. And particularly, I was in what they call the lifers pod. There was 268 men in self care

1:30:09.760 --> 1:30:18.720
 there. And it was unbelievably good that we were left alone. Basically, they were there,

1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:25.040
 the guards were certainly there, but they had their shack and we had apartments for apartments

1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:31.120
 to the building. And six men to the unit with your own door and a key to it and a kitchen,

1:30:31.120 --> 1:30:38.240
 dining room, freezer, refrigerator. And they gave you allowed you $360 a week to buy groceries.

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:45.040
 And I cooked for about 16 years and learned to cook good. And the people and other people

1:30:45.040 --> 1:30:53.520
 have their specialties. And so that was quite, it wasn't so like being in prison. It was

1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:57.840
 somewhat living with me and it was difficult, man. I had some good fights and carry on,

1:30:57.840 --> 1:31:03.520
 and you don't get along with everybody. But then whenever I came back to the United States,

1:31:03.520 --> 1:31:09.360
 I was laughing and talking. And when I got off the plane in LA, I had three marshals with me

1:31:09.360 --> 1:31:18.640
 from Australia. I was slammed up side the wall. I mean, hard, put an ankle or back zone and handcuffed

1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:25.440
 so tight that they cut my plane off, face forward, face forward, lands apart. Good gracious. And walked

1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:30.320
 me 50 steps and turned me over to the marshals and they took part of that off. That was a border

1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:38.320
 patrol that was there over my marijuana charge from 1977. I did 11 years for parole violation.

1:31:38.320 --> 1:31:43.600
 Now, they want me for more violation. And they put me in down in Los Angeles, they put me in the

1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:48.160
 marshals, put me in there, and they put me in isolation. I don't know what in the world they

1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:55.680
 got me for isolation for. I don't need anything. How long did you spend in isolation? More than

1:31:55.680 --> 1:32:02.880
 six months. So I, after three or four days, the little Judas window slide open and a man,

1:32:02.880 --> 1:32:06.880
 a nice looking man in a suit come there, hello Reeves, I want to just want to see what you look

1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:12.560
 like. I saw you in National Geographic documentary and it does me pleasure to keep you in isolation.

1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:16.960
 And he slammed the thing and I couldn't get out of there. And by law, the U.S. Parole Commission

1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:23.440
 has spoke to give you a hearing within 90 days. So Murray paid a lawyer $7,500 and he never picked

1:32:23.440 --> 1:32:30.800
 up the phone. Somebody got to him. Who's that somebody you think? Christopher Callan was his

1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:35.600
 name and I don't know who got to him, but he didn't do anything to get me out of there.

1:32:35.600 --> 1:32:41.920
 I got one 15 minute phone call a month and I couldn't get out. So then after six months, they

1:32:42.720 --> 1:32:53.680
 sent me to put me on conair, double shackled in black box on my hands, and I went to Oklahoma

1:32:53.680 --> 1:33:00.880
 and they let me out on the floor. I couldn't imagine. Then I could call after a couple of days

1:33:00.880 --> 1:33:06.160
 and they said, there was a man here from Washington give you a parole hearing. You only got here

1:33:06.160 --> 1:33:12.880
 at 3.30. So he left. He said he'd be back next year. What? I've been in now over six months.

1:33:12.880 --> 1:33:17.200
 So then there was a lovely little lady. She was a case manager or something. She said,

1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:22.640
 you can ask for parole on the record. And I said, please do. So I'll send them an email

1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:28.080
 and the next day I got my parole. 90 days later, they sent me to Terminal Island and put me in

1:33:28.080 --> 1:33:33.120
 the place there with the infallit, I guess since I'm as old as I am, 78 years old. So they put me

1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:38.560
 into people in there dying and wheelchairs and legs off and arms off and cancer. So I was in

1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:45.120
 there and I pushed the fellas around and I went come out to Chow Hall there and I went to go to

1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:50.160
 the right to get me a haircut and two Mexican guys there looped in another one between us.

1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:56.320
 And he went like, I could outrun you. And they slammed me, put me on the ground, hand cuffed

1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:02.000
 me and put me in the shoe for a week. I got out and man, they put me in a back in the place.

1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:09.280
 They treated me rough. So I got in a little more trouble and they put me back in the shoe and I

1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:14.960
 wouldn't come out. They had that, the virus was killing people. So they killed eight people in

1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:20.480
 that unit I was in. So I mean, I wouldn't even come out to take a shower. I had a little straw

1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:27.200
 that I put in the sink and I take a sock that I had and scrub myself with it with some slope

1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:30.880
 and glass of water over my head and then cleaned the floor up and put it in the toilet.

1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:34.000
 So that was your time during the coronavirus pandemic?

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.720
 I got out last April right in the middle of it and they were dying bad in there.

1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:44.080
 So I was treated worse for that last year in America than I was for the whole 20 years in

1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:50.640
 Australia, 18 years in Australia. And then you were a free man at the end of that year?

1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:54.480
 They put me out and sent me home and the parole officers couldn't even come.

1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:56.960
 They weren't working. They were just doing everything by video.

1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:02.880
 They don't have a drink. The only thing was I couldn't even have a drink of wine.

1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:10.000
 So after a year, I had to take psychiatric treatment every week. I had to go talk to the

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:15.360
 psychiatrist, psychologist. And me and her got along great. She was a good Christian woman.

1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:18.960
 We just chatted and talked and I think they said, so I had to pee in the bottle every week.

1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:23.600
 I said, I've been in 33 years. How many pissed desks do you think I've had?

1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:26.400
 Never been dirty. Only thing if yall want to clean when you come get me.

1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:34.720
 Before I talk to you about love, let me ask you a difficult question. You write in your book,

1:35:34.720 --> 1:35:41.120
 I don't consider myself much of a criminal. I don't lie, cheat or steal and I always take up

1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:49.040
 for the underdog. Violence makes me sick. Yet I know I'm an outlaw and those that break the law

1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:55.840
 must be punished. I think many people listening to this or some people listening to this will see

1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:00.560
 you as a criminal, as a bad man who increased the amount of suffering in this world.

1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:03.760
 What do you have to say to them?

1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:09.680
 I would like to tell them that they have been indoctrinated by the spin

1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:14.640
 of news and politicians and they don't know the truth of the situation.

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:17.920
 You lay the truth out there in an envelope and let me open it.

1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:24.240
 Besides something else that is false and it's staggering. The truth is that I was a tobacco

1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:33.280
 farmer and tobacco kills 500,000 people a year in America and 6 million have a debilitating

1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:42.560
 diseases because of it. Drugs, all drugs combined kill between 10 and 15,000 people a year by overdose

1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:49.200
 and 60% of those are pharmaceutical. Now then when I was a tobacco farmer, come sit on the front

1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:54.160
 pew, Mr. Reeves. Come on up here, you're a gentleman. You just joined the Masonic Lodge and you joined

1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.200
 our church and you just come on and sit down with the good people. You grow two marijuana

1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:06.240
 plants. Get out of here, you scumbag. The marijuana doesn't hurt anybody. That's the truth of it.

1:37:07.840 --> 1:37:17.920
 And so in your career, you walked amidst violence but you never participated in the violence.

1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:24.720
 I didn't even see it. It just didn't happen around me. In prison it did. I sewed people up.

1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:31.520
 They called me doc. I had dental floss and one time I had to get a blade and try to

1:37:32.320 --> 1:37:40.400
 keep them from my patient from getting again. But I just, like if I shot at those people,

1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:43.840
 I shot at them to keep them from killing me. I certainly didn't mean to kill them.

1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:50.000
 So that's just, some people are evil and they will kill you and hurt you, lie to you. I just

1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:55.760
 don't do any of that. It just makes you sick. I've seen it. When I was in the shoe, three guys

1:37:55.760 --> 1:37:59.360
 tried to kill the guy and they stabbed him so many times but they stabbed,

1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:02.560
 breaking the blood, getting out of the room and I said, you're going to kill him. You're going to

1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:07.440
 kill him and save his life. Drug him up there where the guards could see him. There's stuff like that.

1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:12.560
 I'm just not of that nature of those people. They're just evil. They're people born evil, I believe.

1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:19.280
 Yeah. It is heartbreaking to hear that the basic humanity has gone in prison

1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:24.320
 in the United States. That's heartbreaking because that basic humanity is actually the

1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:28.960
 light at the end of the tunnel. It's the thing that saves us as opposed to when it's absent. It's

1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:34.960
 the thing that destroys us. The prisons are filled, absolutely filled with people that have some

1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:41.280
 mental problems. Now, you see tent city all the way up and down here. I guarantee you,

1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:47.120
 every one of those people have mental problems. Some degree, however little it is, but they're a

1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:52.960
 little bit off. Now, then you get a DEA agent that wants to make a name for himself. He goes down

1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:56.880
 there and gets two of them, one of them to sell a little two grams of methamphetamine to the other

1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:03.360
 one and he gets a conviction. And a young prosecutor, he gets a conviction. He wants to make a judge.

1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:08.160
 And we got the judge in, where was it? I'm going to give a million, what was his name? Gilbert.

1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:13.200
 I'm going to give him in a million years before I get off the judge. You get foods like that

1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:22.160
 in charge. You're going to fill prisons up with pitiful humanity. And those are the ones. And

1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:35.120
 then the other is people over drugs. And drugs should be a health issue. You cannot police it

1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:42.000
 enough. They know the only thing that overdoses is opioids, the heroin. And if they can give it

1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:47.120
 to them, it costs about a dollar a day to give the worst addict his fix. But they'll give it

1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:52.640
 methadone, which is from a pharmaceutical company, which is just as bad. Why in the world, we tried

1:39:52.640 --> 1:40:01.200
 it all over the world in Portugal and England. And when they give the girls cleanup, no more

1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:09.600
 stolen cars. Why? Who wants to keep this forest going? They're just perpetuating it. Like, oh,

1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:16.160
 every little police place is getting all these suits and armor and machine guns. It's just like,

1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:21.440
 oh, it's such a spin. It's sad. Do you think all drugs should be legalized?

1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:27.760
 I don't know about that, but they certainly should be controlled if a person is an addict.

1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:34.400
 He should be able to go down and get his fix with somebody there to help him with a clean needle

1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:39.920
 and a glass of orange juice. It's so much cheaper than prison, so much cheaper than him stealing

1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:46.080
 cars or prostitute having to go to work. That's sad. You've lived one heck of a life.

1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:55.760
 Looking back, there's a lot of young people that listen to this, high school, college students.

1:40:55.760 --> 1:41:02.640
 What advice would you give them? How to live? How to have a successful career? How to have a good

1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:12.400
 life? How to be a good man or woman? To be a good man or woman, if I had it to do over with,

1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:16.080
 I'd just tell you what I'd have done. I would have paid attention and studied my lesson

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:23.120
 and did the best I could. In school? In school, yes, and went as far as I could have. I would

1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:27.040
 have liked to have been a doctor. I just didn't have the stickability or anybody to tell me,

1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:33.680
 hey, go over there and do that. If you can do that at a very young age, start in a trade,

1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:39.520
 learn to do something. It doesn't matter what it is. If you learn to do something good,

1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:48.080
 there is a great demand for you. I would say that in prison, the prison system should come in and

1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:56.320
 you get a thief, young fans of thief, robber, and you say, all right, we need carpenters,

1:41:56.320 --> 1:42:01.920
 we need plumbers, we need electricians, we need sheep. Sentence them to that trade,

1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:06.240
 and when you get an A plus in that, where you can go out and make you $30 or $50 an hour,

1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:12.160
 you go home. Now, you can mess around 10 years if you want to or you can do this in two. I think

1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:18.320
 that's just for the prison. But anyway, I would say that they find somebody and be true to them,

1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:24.400
 that we have, just be honest and true in your life.

1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:26.800
 You mean like relationships?

1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:34.720
 Relationships, yes. I mean, so many people, particularly our children, are from relationships

1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:40.240
 where they're not wanted, they're divorced, their father's left, they don't know who their daddy is,

1:42:40.240 --> 1:42:46.720
 they diss in foster homes, 500,000 children in foster homes in America today. And we have,

1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:53.440
 our government inadvertently is encouraging those people. My daughter is a doctor and she

1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:59.120
 delivered a couple of years ago a baby from a 10 year old child. That child, and she said,

1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:04.400
 in the visiting room is four generations, all of them on welfare. Now, we got one more and it

1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:14.720
 reminds me of Elvis Presley's song, Indighetto. So for an individual, learn a trade, become a

1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:21.440
 craftsman of sorts, and find somebody to love and who loves you. That's right. Have a family

1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:28.080
 and stick with it. Surely, you're going to get angry, you're going to get disappointed,

1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:32.320
 you're going to get all kind of stuff, but come back and make up before you go to sleep.

1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:38.800
 Well, I did half of those things. I got the first one and working on the second one,

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:44.480
 so I appreciate the advice. Well, Mari, thank you so much for joining us.

1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:52.240
 Can you tell me the story of how you do that? Well, my parents every summer would go to the

1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:58.800
 lake in Canada, and the place was called Turkey Point, which is on Lake Erie, and just have a

1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:05.760
 nice summer holiday there, water skiing, swimming, sunbathing. This was back in the 60s, and I was

1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:10.880
 sitting on the pier with a few girlfriends and telling them my story, and then all of a sudden,

1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:19.360
 I looked up and I saw this figure in the distance coming onto the pier. Now, we're all dressed in

1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:24.480
 bathing suits and swimwear. We're swimming in this, that, and the other, and here he comes,

1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:33.600
 dark trousers. In fact, they were black, white shirt and a tie, and a straw kind of a Panama hat.

1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:42.800
 And so he stood out, and so I invited him to come and sit down, and so he continued to talk,

1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:49.280
 and we just talked and talked and talked, and then later moved to the beach. And I think the next

1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:57.280
 time I saw him, he was talking to another girl, and I thought, yeah, I know. I was okay. Okay,

1:44:57.280 --> 1:45:04.160
 next. Well, about six months later, I received a letter, and it's a letter from Roger,

1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:09.760
 and then we start this lovely correspondence, and we just start writing. In those days,

1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:16.800
 you just wrote everything. And then the next summer, he was coming up again. He was on his way

1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:23.680
 to Alaska, and he says, I would like to come by and see you. And I said, well, I'll be in the same

1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:31.840
 place that I met you last year. And so when he came up this time, for some reason, Roger reached

1:45:31.840 --> 1:45:39.200
 for my hand, and I reached for his, and man, that was it. It was like love at first touch.

1:45:39.200 --> 1:45:46.880
 That was love. It was just like a silence, you know, in a, oh my gosh, and we didn't even look at

1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:51.280
 each other. It was just, oh my goodness, what happened here? And I was the type of person,

1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:56.400
 I never wanted to get married, not way, way, way down the road, never have any children,

1:45:56.400 --> 1:46:03.520
 and I wanted to see the world first, and then do all that, you know. But that was it. That was love,

1:46:03.520 --> 1:46:12.080
 and you've been together ever since. Yeah. Well, the thing is about the love that the two of you

1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:20.400
 have for each other is they had to persevere through quite a heck of a journey. So how did

1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:26.720
 Roger's drug smuggling change the nature of your love and your relationship?

1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:37.360
 Well, Lex, that remains steadfast. It endured, and since Roger's been home, I think we've rekindled

1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:43.360
 the love that we had when we first met. Yeah, what? But I think my faith,

1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:51.840
 you know, my faith, my steadfast faith, and also the fact that Roger and I communicated,

1:46:51.840 --> 1:46:57.520
 we wrote letters, you know. He never complained. I know there were the children there. He never

1:46:57.520 --> 1:47:03.600
 had mistreated me. I love this guy. And we had a lot of experiences. It was just even the life.

1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:07.440
 He's a good looking charismatic. He's pretty, you know. Yeah, and he's adventurous. He was

1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:18.720
 adventurous, you know, and would you say that again? But yes, it was just, I know, I missed

1:47:18.720 --> 1:47:26.640
 him physically, but he was just, we were just so strong in spirit, you know, and we could talk

1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:36.000
 to one another. Yeah. Well, what was it like, Roger, when you're a free man, seeing Mari for

1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:44.000
 the first time in person again? I cried for three days. Everything, I'd look at a picture of her.

1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:51.440
 I came home and there, she prepared a meal for me. And there was the old oak table that I'd

1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:59.200
 redone and the chairs, the same one, and the green placemats, and the same china that we had,

1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:04.720
 and the same silverware. And it just, just all of it just brought back the same paintings on the wall.

1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:11.360
 It was just like unbelievable. After 35 years, she had all my clothes cleaned and my shoes shining.

1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:17.280
 I put the shoes on and I walked out on the strings and the soles came on with the shirts and all fit

1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:22.640
 perfect. Everything, so it just was wonderful. And just to see her and then just to think about,

1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:29.040
 see her picture of her 50th birthday or her 60th birthday or her 70th birthday, I wasn't there.

1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:33.920
 And the picture of her and with the children, it was heartbreaking. And about the third day,

1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:41.760
 I thought, man up, I mean, you've got to. So I got over and quit the tears.

1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:48.000
 Everything was just pulsating with life. It was just unbelievable to get out of that place.

1:48:48.640 --> 1:49:00.800
 It really was. Is there, do you regret the drug smuggling that took you away from the one you love?

1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:10.320
 Oh, yes, 100%. I wouldn't have done it again if you don't think you're going to get caught.

1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:16.480
 And it's just, no, it's just, I did it for money and I had everything in the world I wanted before

1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:23.680
 I did that. So the adventure, I mean, it was one heck of an adventure for the two of you,

1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:30.400
 for the both of you. Were you able to enjoy it or was it always danger? Was it always

1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:36.560
 something that threatened your relationship, your love, your family? Are we able to enjoy the

1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:42.160
 adventure of it? You know, we'll all die. Life is short. And to live that kind of adventure.

1:49:42.720 --> 1:49:48.400
 Well, whenever I did the first loot, I got $10,000. And that was just about two years

1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:54.160
 pay on the fire department take home. And I brought that home and I put my hand over my mouth. I said,

1:49:54.160 --> 1:50:04.400
 oh, Roger, I can't believe this. Roger said, let's go have dinner. And so we went to the

1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:09.760
 restaurant that we would go to, you know, and he said, and don't you dare look on the right hand

1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:17.040
 side of the menu. He said, just order anything you want. And it was just as we were in the

1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:22.640
 restaurant, you know, it was just we were giddy about it. Yeah, I was giddy about it.

1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:29.360
 And were you afraid that, I mean, did you think about the fact that it's illegal

1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:35.200
 and Roger can end up in prison? Oh, yes. Did you guys talk about it?

1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:40.400
 Well, I just, I kind of thought I was bulletproof. I mean, they didn't catch you. I thought if they

1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:45.200
 didn't catch you, you was all right. It was hard to catch you. Hard to catch you in the air.

1:50:45.200 --> 1:50:52.000
 So you never thought hard to catch you in the air. I didn't know that if your friend told

1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:56.640
 on you five years later, you'd still go to prison. That was a problem. I didn't know that.

1:50:57.200 --> 1:51:03.600
 Did you guys ever talk about walking away? I asked Roger to walk away. And he says,

1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:11.040
 I can't Mario just now, you know, and then of course, the amount of people that he began to

1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:18.800
 support the family and the gifts and the deals, the deals. Yes, the deals. Big ones. Yes. And

1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:23.680
 then you always want to do, what do you do with the money? You know, so you want to,

1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:31.200
 I guess you clean it up or you want to invest in a, in an enterprise or in a business. Well,

1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:35.200
 it just doesn't work. They know the source of it and they take it and run.

1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:45.120
 Every one of them. Yeah. Yeah. But he was very generous, extremely generous and benevolent and.

1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:51.440
 And when I started, I would ask about, I went to a lawyer and a good, good people, a number of

1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:57.680
 people in California at that time wanted to legalize marijuana back in 1973. And I went to a

1:51:57.680 --> 1:52:01.840
 lawyer and I says, Mr. Lawyer, I put a hundred dollars on the table. What would they do if I

1:52:01.840 --> 1:52:06.960
 caught me bringing marijuana across the board? He said, if you have a criminal record, I said,

1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:13.120
 no, I've never had a speeding ticket, nothing, not even a traffic ticket. I said, he said,

1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:18.320
 you work for the fire department? I don't know. I said, yes, sir. He said, you'll get probation.

1:52:18.880 --> 1:52:24.160
 The worst you'll do is you'll get one year and you spend four, four months raking leaves on the

1:52:24.160 --> 1:52:29.200
 military base. So my mother and my father died some years before and I brought mother and baby

1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:34.240
 sister came out and I took them down to Disneyland and she said, what you doing, boy? I said, I'm

1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:38.880
 hauling pot, mom. She said, how much you making? I said, making $40,000 any day I want to go.

1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:42.720
 And she said, what do they do if they catch you? And I told her what the lawyer said,

1:52:43.440 --> 1:52:46.640
 four months at the most where it raking leaves. That's what do you think? She said,

1:52:46.640 --> 1:52:55.840
 do you need a co pilot son? Yeah, money is money. Yeah. So your relationship

1:52:57.040 --> 1:53:03.040
 persevered through some, some big challenges. Is there advice you can give about what

1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:13.840
 makes for a successful relationship? Oh, well, you know, I think the initial igniting meeting

1:53:13.840 --> 1:53:21.440
 someone, you know, that that's the love. That's it. And that that little fire just that fire just

1:53:21.440 --> 1:53:28.480
 keeps burning and burning and burning. You can't put it out, no matter what it's the love fire.

1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:34.880
 But it gets difficult. It's funny. It's funny, the love fire. So you're saying the love fires

1:53:34.880 --> 1:53:40.560
 all it takes to to persevere through the difficulty. Well, no, I well, that's a huge part of it.

1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:50.320
 And also, I contribute my my individual situation to in order to endure what the prison years is my

1:53:50.320 --> 1:53:59.600
 faith. Faith in God. Yes. And friends who were unconditionally still loved me no matter what.

1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:10.480
 Yes. So she had love around you. I did. And my children, they, you know, and that was a real

1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:21.520
 purpose to guide them and to love them and to help them become citizens. What advice would you give?

1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:26.160
 I just don't know how to do it. I do know that you have to work on a relationship.

1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:30.240
 And Maury and I has had problems. I mean, we get really good guys getting fights. Oh, yeah.

1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:37.200
 Oh, yes. But not they don't let them last long. Yeah. You know, but certainly,

1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:41.360
 well, you're so different. We're the same and yet we're so different. Yeah.

1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:47.920
 Like little stuff. Little stuff, yes. And it might be big, but I usually win her over, you know.

1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:56.560
 But anyhow, I just feel like Maury was always there. It was like she was my anchor. I was coming

1:54:56.560 --> 1:55:01.600
 home. I was always coming home to her and the children. And you can see throughout my life,

1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:07.280
 I'm working on getting there. Are you afraid for his life, by the way? Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. There

1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:13.280
 are times. Yeah. But you know, I had some, I had faith in him. He was an excellent pilot.

1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:18.560
 For example, I always said, Roger, if the ship's going down, I'm jumping in the lifeboat with you

1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:23.920
 because I know we're going to get to shore. You will save us. And so I had that, I have that faith

1:55:23.920 --> 1:55:29.120
 in him. You know, I mean, he's, he's a man, but yet he's the one you want to get into the lifeboat

1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:35.840
 with. Definitely. But then there is, you know, Pablo Escobar, one of the most dangerous humans

1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:46.160
 in history, plus the US government. Very difficult, very difficult to get away.

1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:54.160
 In terms of your faith, how has your faith helped you to be the woman you are in this

1:55:54.160 --> 1:56:02.480
 relationship in, in, in seeing love the way you see it? Well, I think my faith gives me hope.

1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:11.920
 I have lots of hope. It helps me to dwell on the good side. You know, when I ever, I meet someone

1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:19.440
 and there's some negative, I try to see why they are like that or what's the source of all that.

1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:24.800
 And I try to pull out the good. I really do. Not that I'm a goody goody,

1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:30.080
 but that's what your faith does. You know, you see them as God sees us, you know.

1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:37.360
 How has he changed over the years? Roger. Yeah. He's still the same. Actually, I like him better

1:56:37.360 --> 1:56:45.280
 now. He's a little calmer. Yeah, he looks crazy. Oh, yes. And happy to be, you know, at home or

1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:52.000
 he'll say, Mari, I am just so happy to be with you here in this condominium. I'm content because I

1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:57.520
 used to call him my homing pigeon. You know, I just have to let him fly. I couldn't, you know,

1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:05.520
 he has to fly, but he always came home. Do you think about the end of this ride,

1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:10.880
 our mortality? Do you think about your death? I do. Particularly, I'm going to have

1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:18.320
 a heart valve replacement in about seven days where I could not make it. You know,

1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:27.200
 it's a very serious operation. And I think about that very much. And I ask for peace. I just lost

1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:34.000
 my brother about 10 days ago so unexpectedly. And that really put, you know, makes you think of

1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:46.160
 your mortality. Are you afraid? Somewhat and some and yet not. Yeah. I want to live, Lex. I want to

1:57:46.160 --> 1:57:53.360
 live, you know. This life is fun. Yes. Do you think about your death, Roger? I have visions.

1:57:54.640 --> 1:58:00.800
 Visions in health can happen very, very clear, like what I have seen in the future. Scientists

1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:06.720
 might call it wormholes or in the Old Testament, they call it profits. But I see sometimes in the

1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:10.960
 future around the corner. It's clear as we're sitting right here. What's that look like?

1:58:11.520 --> 1:58:15.920
 I was on a porch and I believe I was in like Central America place. I was an old man with

1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:22.000
 khaki pants and a white shirt. And it was a chair with a wide arms and it was straight.

1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:26.960
 And there was like the beams coming out above my head and I'm on a porch. Boke and be ya.

1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:35.840
 And I come, I have out of the body experiences also. And I came out of my body just, I just

1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:42.000
 floated out of my body and went into a veil and like into a mist. And I believe that's probably

1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:47.760
 why it happened. You talk about, you talk about like it's in your past. This is your future.

1:58:47.760 --> 1:58:53.120
 This is in my future. But this is something he has seen in the past.

1:58:53.120 --> 1:58:59.600
 Yeah. No, I know, but it's funny. Just the tense you use, it happened and yet it's something

1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:06.400
 that will happen to both are true. It's just unbelievable. And I don't know how many people

1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:10.640
 have it, but I have it. Out of my body, just like, just where I could come up to you and

1:59:10.640 --> 1:59:14.960
 look and set up on the radio. I used to be at work on the railroad and I had them there.

1:59:14.960 --> 1:59:20.400
 How do you explain that? What the heck is going on in this universe that's possible?

1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:25.280
 Oh, I don't know, but certainly, certainly a phenomenon that just happened. And

1:59:26.720 --> 1:59:31.040
 there's a guy, Bill Monroe, that wrote the book on the out of the body. He tells about it.

1:59:31.040 --> 1:59:34.960
 And who was the guy that writes the Alchemist?

1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:37.360
 Pablo Coelho?

1:59:37.360 --> 1:59:41.680
 He has them also, just like that. And he tells about how it happens on him.

1:59:41.680 --> 1:59:46.880
 Might happen differently. But you certainly can come out of your body.

1:59:46.880 --> 1:59:56.720
 What do you think the meaning of this life is? Maybe from your faith, but also from just

1:59:57.760 --> 2:00:03.200
 the amazing adventure that you live through? How do you make sense of why the heck we're here?

2:00:05.280 --> 2:00:10.880
 I don't know. It's just kind of like who you are. Even when I was a child, I was like,

2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:16.880
 I'm different from other people. And just as a boy, I was.

2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:22.800
 Could you put into words how you were different or was just the feeling?

2:00:22.800 --> 2:00:28.240
 Yeah. My brother, I mean, he kept his hands clean and his shoes shined. And here I was barefooted

2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:32.640
 catching a wild hog or rafting a horse trying to get it down.

2:00:32.640 --> 2:00:35.760
 I saw pictures of you climbing a tree recently.

2:00:35.760 --> 2:00:39.040
 When I first got out of prison, always something like that.

2:00:40.560 --> 2:00:47.520
 So I don't know. It's just that and I noticed that something about me is sometimes in prison,

2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:53.600
 there'd be a knife fight. And people just, you see them rough guys that turn white from it.

2:00:55.040 --> 2:01:00.960
 I just kind of almost like smile. I mean, if they come at me, I'll turn white, you know what?

2:01:00.960 --> 2:01:06.480
 But it doesn't bother those things. That doesn't bother me. I just prison didn't bother me.

2:01:06.480 --> 2:01:10.400
 So you don't know what the heck the meaning is. You just know you're a bit different than the others.

2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:11.840
 Yeah. Might be a little bit cookie.

2:01:13.040 --> 2:01:21.200
 Well, maybe the whole point is you want to realize you want to let that madness flourish,

2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:25.600
 that uniqueness flourish. That's the whole point of life. We're all different and are

2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:29.680
 in like very interesting little ways. And the more different you are, you want to let that,

2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:33.680
 you want to let that become, you want to let it be as full as possible.

2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:36.320
 It's like a garden. You know, all the different flowers.

2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:37.440
 It's like a garden. Yeah, like a garden.

2:01:37.440 --> 2:01:40.880
 You did mention you weren't sure if there's a free will or not.

2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:47.200
 Do you think it's all predetermined? Or do you think we make out with your decisions?

2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:51.120
 I just said if it is, I hope that it. But I know that we make out decisions.

2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:52.480
 Yes, I agree.

2:01:52.480 --> 2:01:58.720
 And I know that we're spirits that are living in this flesh. That's beyond a shadow of a doubt

2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:03.120
 with me. If you walk out of your body and have out of the body experience, you will know it.

2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:06.240
 So the body is just the temporary container for something which.

2:02:06.240 --> 2:02:10.880
 The spirit lives on eternally with no beginning and no end. And that's hard to fathom.

2:02:11.440 --> 2:02:17.040
 Yeah, this is just a little shell to contain that spirit. You know, this is the way we

2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:22.160
 work on earth, you know. But yeah, I know. I'm an eternal being. So are you.

2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:28.720
 Do you think there's a why to it? Do you think there's a meaning to this life?

2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:35.920
 Well, I think the why is beyond my capability of understanding. It's someone greater than me.

2:02:35.920 --> 2:02:43.440
 I don't understand it. But it's awesome. I just know that it's awesome. And one day we will know

2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:49.200
 the answers. Once we get to that crossover to the other side, I think we will understand

2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:55.040
 clearly. It says, you know, now we see through a glass, darkly. But then when we are face to

2:02:55.040 --> 2:03:02.800
 face with God, we will understand. And until we know, let's just enjoy this beautiful life.

2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:08.800
 Yes. All we got it. And we're meant. That was my gift. I love everybody and everything.

2:03:09.680 --> 2:03:14.800
 I do. And it just, and I'm sorry if I put a stumbling block in anybody's way. I wouldn't

2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:22.720
 want to. But these are these things that I just think about. Oh, what a hypocritical world we live

2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:29.520
 in, though. Like, most anybody out there listen, okay, he's a drug dealer. And I would say most

2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:36.480
 of them are committed adultery. That's a cardinal sin. Yet they move through rocks at me for moving

2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:43.120
 marijuana cocaine across the road. Yeah. It's just if you saw the two different things, you'd say,

2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:49.600
 what a terrible difference it is. But we become conditioned with this mad society that we have.

2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:57.040
 You mentioned that your daughter, Miriam, wrote you a poem. You mind reading it?

2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:03.440
 I'd be glad to. I was doing 11 years up in Lombok Penitentiary, maximum security prison

2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:10.000
 for parole violation for possession of marijuana in 1977. They should have given me six months,

2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:14.880
 but they gave me 11 years because they wanted me for what they call silent beef. Anyhow,

2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:19.600
 while I was in that dungeon, I received a letter from my daughter, Miriam,

2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:26.720
 called Daddy's poem. A year ago, I became a poet when I wrote your birthday prose.

2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:33.280
 And here I am today, ready to give it another go. First, I would like to wish you a very happy

2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:40.560
 birthday to be and to thank you so very much for without you, I would not be me. Secondly,

2:04:40.560 --> 2:04:46.560
 I want to say that your support has been immense. It has been true, honest, loving, and free of all

2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:54.240
 pretense. Thirdly, it goes without saying your love has surpassed all my wrongs, and you always

2:04:54.240 --> 2:05:01.440
 made me smile with one of your old country songs. I can remember on Quervo, Daddy, with you holding

2:05:01.440 --> 2:05:07.280
 me in your arms as you sang Jim Reeve's songs and talked about the farm. I can see you walking

2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:12.480
 through the door from one of your travels far and wide, and the thought of you coming home, Daddy,

2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:18.000
 kept a twinkle in our eyes. I can smell you as I did when I used to climb into your bed,

2:05:18.720 --> 2:05:23.360
 and you would talk to me again about one of the adventures that you led. I can see me and

2:05:23.360 --> 2:05:29.520
 Mario asleep in one of your airplane's extraordinaire, and remembering wondering to myself

2:05:29.520 --> 2:05:35.040
 why there wasn't an available chair. I remember having to meet you and worrying that you wouldn't

2:05:35.040 --> 2:05:42.000
 be there, but you would pop from behind some counter and give us all a happy scare. You gave

2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:48.080
 us presents in Quibis King and Hotels Pleasure Galore and three dozen roses that we came through

2:05:48.080 --> 2:05:54.240
 the airport door. I can see your face in Amsterdam with the luggage carousel, and you looked like a

2:05:54.240 --> 2:05:59.920
 boy with a secret that you were just dying to tell. You taught me mathematics in the sands of far

2:05:59.920 --> 2:06:06.880
 away places, and taught me to sail, and we left without any traces. We climbed glaciers in Argentina

2:06:06.880 --> 2:06:12.960
 and saw the blue of the beautiful caves, and witnessed the majestic beauty of such a juggling

2:06:12.960 --> 2:06:19.440
 maze. I learned how to change gears on the dirt roads of Brazil. We ate hot dogs in Paraguay,

2:06:19.440 --> 2:06:25.600
 a memory we smile over still. We talked about lions, elephants, and bears on a hacienda in

2:06:25.600 --> 2:06:32.160
 Uruguay, but decided it was better if to Europe we did fly. Over the old world and all its luxury,

2:06:32.160 --> 2:06:38.160
 what a good time it was. From South America to the Krasmopolski, I think we fell in love.

2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:45.760
 The European jaunt, well, it is considered a book in itself, but it's a story about beauty and

2:06:45.760 --> 2:06:50.880
 knowledge, suspense, and worldly wealth. We went from Holland to Sweden, and we went from France

2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:57.600
 to Spain, and I promise you I have no regrets. I would definitely do it all again. I would see

2:06:57.600 --> 2:07:02.880
 the world with you anytime, sir. There's no doubt in my mind, because being by your side,

2:07:02.880 --> 2:07:10.000
 Daddy, always ensures a wild good time. So our paths took a turn, and we're back in the US of A,

2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:16.400
 but life here isn't so bad, and I'm plumb content to stay. I'm happy to be near you, although I'm

2:07:16.400 --> 2:07:22.160
 not as close as I was before, but because of your loving encouragement, I've been able to open your

2:07:22.160 --> 2:07:29.120
 doors. I'm grateful to be in school, and I'm generally happy where I am, and I even like when

2:07:29.120 --> 2:07:35.040
 you call and tell me to study for the next exam. What a life you're giving me, Daddy. It's a

2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:40.960
 tremendous and a magical gift. We already have so many stories to tell, there are far too many to

2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:47.360
 list. But I want to thank you again this day for the very big happy birthday to you, and to tell

2:07:47.360 --> 2:07:53.280
 you just a few more things that are new in my heart to be true. I love you, Daddy, with all of

2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:58.320
 your wrongs and your rights, that you're ahead of our family, and you've kept us all bound tight,

2:07:59.040 --> 2:08:04.640
 that you have an honest love in your heart for God and all mankind, and you truly do believe in

2:08:04.640 --> 2:08:10.960
 yourself when you say it will all be fine. I know you will be there to catch me if ever I

2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:17.920
 waver a slip, and I know I'd want you as captain on any sinking ship. I also know a new chapter is

2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:24.640
 written. It's almost time to move on. It's time to sail another sea and to witness a brand new dawn.

2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:29.680
 It'd be good to see you at the helm again as you point out our destination,

2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:35.680
 the laugh and dance on the upper deck while the boat glides through. It'll be good to see you on

2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:43.760
 the go as I know you like to be and to know you can open any door without any key. But while we

2:08:43.760 --> 2:08:49.840
 revel in our days together, we will know better than to hurry because as you told me many times,

2:08:49.840 --> 2:09:01.200
 life is an incredible journey. That's beautiful. Yeah. Roger, I'm really honored that you would

2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:07.440
 take the time to visit me in Texas and to sit down and talk with me. Thank you so much, Roger.

2:09:07.440 --> 2:09:12.400
 Thank you. Thank you. It was a pleasure. It's been a real pleasure. Yes. Beautiful.

2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:17.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Roger Reeves, and thank you to

2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:24.560
 Noom, Allform, ExpressVPN, FourSigmatic, and AIDSleep. Check them out in the description

2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:30.080
 to support this podcast. And now, let me leave you with some words from Pablo Escobar.

2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:47.760
 All Empires are created of blood and fire. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
