00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
 The following is a conversation with Richard Rangham,

00:03.240 --> 00:05.720
 a biological anthropologist at Harvard,

00:05.720 --> 00:08.240
 specializing in the study of primates

00:08.240 --> 00:12.200
 and the evolution of violence, sex, cooking, culture,

00:12.200 --> 00:15.160
 and other aspects of ape and human behavior

00:15.160 --> 00:18.360
 at the individual and societal level.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.960
 He began his career over four decades ago

00:20.960 --> 00:22.320
 working with Jane Goodall

00:22.320 --> 00:24.560
 and studying the behavior of chimps.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.320
 And since then, has done a lot of seminal work

00:27.320 --> 00:28.680
 on human evolution

00:28.680 --> 00:32.320
 and has proposed several theories for the roles of fire

00:32.320 --> 00:35.200
 and violence in the evolution of us,

00:35.200 --> 00:39.480
 hairless apes, otherwise known as homo sapiens.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.700
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.880
 in the description.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.960
 And now here's my conversation with Richard Rangham.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.100
 You've said that we're much less violent

00:53.100 --> 00:57.000
 than our close living relatives, the chimps.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
 Can you elaborate on this point of how violent we are

01:01.000 --> 01:04.520
 and how violent our evolutionary relatives are?

01:04.520 --> 01:06.000
 Well, I haven't said exactly

01:06.000 --> 01:07.960
 that we're less violent than chimps.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.280
 What I've said is that there are two kinds of violence.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.280
 One stems from proactive aggression

01:13.280 --> 01:15.600
 and the other stems from reactive aggression.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.840
 Proactive aggression is planned aggression.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.760
 Reactive aggression is impulsive, defensive.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.560
 It's reactive because it takes place

01:24.560 --> 01:28.000
 in seconds after the threat.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.880
 And the thing that is really striking about humans

01:30.880 --> 01:33.800
 compared to our close relatives

01:33.800 --> 01:38.800
 is the great reduction in the degree of reactive aggression.

01:40.280 --> 01:43.200
 So we are far less violent than chimps

01:43.200 --> 01:46.720
 when prompted by some relatively minor threat

01:46.720 --> 01:48.680
 within our own society.

01:48.680 --> 01:53.680
 And the way I judge that is with not super satisfactory data

01:53.680 --> 01:58.680
 but the study which is particularly striking

01:59.420 --> 02:04.420
 is one of people living as hunter gatherers

02:05.180 --> 02:09.700
 in a really upsetting kind of environment,

02:09.700 --> 02:14.700
 namely people in Australia living in a place

02:15.300 --> 02:19.180
 where they got a lot of alcohol abuse.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.420
 There's a lot of domestic violence.

02:21.420 --> 02:26.420
 It's all a sort of a society that is as bad

02:29.220 --> 02:30.500
 from the point of view of violence

02:30.500 --> 02:33.140
 as an ordinary society can get.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.940
 There's excellent data on the frequency

02:36.940 --> 02:39.180
 which people actually have physical violence

02:39.180 --> 02:40.420
 and hit each other.

02:40.420 --> 02:45.020
 And we can compare that to data from several different sites

02:45.020 --> 02:50.020
 comparing, we're looking at chimpanzee and bonobo violence

02:50.020 --> 02:53.940
 and the difference is between two and three orders

02:53.940 --> 02:57.460
 of magnitude, the frequency which chimps and bonobos

02:57.460 --> 03:00.660
 hit each other, chase each other, charge each other,

03:00.660 --> 03:05.660
 physically engage is someday between 500 and 1,000 times

03:06.300 --> 03:08.340
 higher than in humans.

03:08.340 --> 03:09.860
 So there's something just amazing about us

03:09.860 --> 03:13.540
 and this has been recognized for centuries.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.940
 Aristotle drew attention to the fact

03:15.940 --> 03:18.980
 that we behave in many ways like domesticated animals

03:18.980 --> 03:21.300
 because we're so unviolent.

03:21.300 --> 03:26.300
 But people say, well, what about the hideous engagements

03:26.780 --> 03:30.980
 of this 20th century, the First and Second World War

03:30.980 --> 03:33.620
 and much else besides.

03:33.620 --> 03:37.100
 And that is all proactive violence.

03:37.100 --> 03:42.100
 All of that is gangs of people making deliberate decisions

03:43.420 --> 03:46.020
 to go off and attack in circumstances

03:46.020 --> 03:49.580
 which ideally the attackers are going to be able

03:49.580 --> 03:52.380
 to make their kills and then get out of there.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.860
 In other words, not face confrontation.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.740
 That's the ordinary way that arm is trying to work.

03:58.740 --> 04:03.740
 And there it turns out that humans and chimpanzees

04:04.820 --> 04:07.060
 are in a very similar kind of state.

04:07.060 --> 04:10.940
 That is to say, if you look at the rate of death

04:10.940 --> 04:13.700
 from chimpanzees conducting proactive

04:13.700 --> 04:17.180
 of coalitionary violence, it's very similar

04:17.180 --> 04:20.300
 in many ways to what you see in humans.

04:20.300 --> 04:23.620
 So when not downregulated with proactive violence,

04:23.620 --> 04:25.780
 it's just this reactive violence

04:25.780 --> 04:29.180
 that is strikingly reduced in humans.

04:29.180 --> 04:33.260
 So chimpanzees also practice kind of tribal warfare.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.100
 Indeed they do, yeah.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.980
 So this was discovered first in 1974.

04:38.980 --> 04:41.020
 It was observed first in 1974,

04:41.020 --> 04:46.020
 which was about the time that the first major study

04:48.060 --> 04:51.180
 of chimpanzees in the wild by Jane Goodall

04:51.180 --> 04:55.420
 had been going for something like five years

04:55.420 --> 05:00.420
 during, of the chimpanzees being observed wherever they went.

05:02.740 --> 05:06.980
 Until then they'd been observed at a feeding station

05:06.980 --> 05:11.060
 where Jane was luring them in to be observed

05:11.060 --> 05:12.940
 by seeing bananas, which is great.

05:12.940 --> 05:15.340
 She learned a lot, but she didn't learn

05:15.340 --> 05:17.940
 what was happening at the edges of their ranges.

05:17.940 --> 05:22.500
 So five years later, it became very obvious

05:22.500 --> 05:25.660
 that there was hostile relationships between groups.

05:25.660 --> 05:30.580
 And those hostile relationships sometimes take the form

05:30.580 --> 05:32.620
 of the kind of hostile relationships

05:32.620 --> 05:33.740
 that you see in many animals,

05:33.740 --> 05:38.740
 which is a bunch of chimps in this case,

05:38.940 --> 05:43.940
 shouting at a bunch of other chimps on their borders.

05:44.980 --> 05:47.580
 But dramatically, in addition to that,

05:47.580 --> 05:49.340
 there is a second kind of interaction.

05:49.340 --> 05:54.340
 And that is when a party of chimpanzees

05:55.980 --> 06:00.980
 makes a deliberate venture to the edge of their territory

06:00.980 --> 06:05.980
 silently and then search for members of neighboring groups.

06:06.860 --> 06:10.580
 And what they're searching for is a lone individual.

06:10.580 --> 06:14.220
 So I've been with chimps when they've heard

06:14.220 --> 06:16.740
 a lone individual under these circumstances

06:16.740 --> 06:18.660
 or what they think is a lone one,

06:18.660 --> 06:21.940
 and they touch each other and look at each other

06:21.940 --> 06:25.060
 and then charge forward, very excited.

06:25.060 --> 06:30.060
 Very excited, and then while they're charging,

06:30.860 --> 06:35.500
 all of a sudden, the place where they heard a lone call

06:35.500 --> 06:37.460
 erupts with a volley of calls.

06:37.460 --> 06:40.820
 It was just one calling out of a larger party.

06:40.820 --> 06:43.460
 And our chimps put on the brakes

06:43.460 --> 06:46.660
 and scoot back for safety into their own territory.

06:46.660 --> 06:49.620
 But if in fact they do find a lone individual

06:49.620 --> 06:52.420
 and they can sneak up to them,

06:52.420 --> 06:54.980
 then they make a deliberate attack,

06:54.980 --> 06:57.540
 they're hunting, they're stalking and hunting,

06:57.540 --> 07:00.660
 and then they impose terrible damage,

07:00.660 --> 07:03.060
 which typically ends in a kill straight away,

07:03.060 --> 07:08.060
 but it might end up with the victim so damaged

07:08.300 --> 07:13.300
 that they'll crawl away and die a few days or hours later.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.380
 So that was a very dramatic discovery

07:15.380 --> 07:20.380
 because it really made people realize for the first time

07:20.500 --> 07:22.780
 that Conrad Lorenz had been wrong

07:22.780 --> 07:26.900
 when in the 1960s, in his famous book On Aggression,

07:26.900 --> 07:30.780
 he said warfare is restricted to humans,

07:30.780 --> 07:33.060
 animals do not deliberately kill each other.

07:33.060 --> 07:35.180
 Well, now we know that actually there's a bunch of animals

07:35.180 --> 07:36.420
 that deliberately kill each other,

07:36.420 --> 07:38.540
 and they always do so under essentially

07:38.540 --> 07:39.700
 the same circumstances,

07:39.700 --> 07:44.220
 which is when they feel safe doing it.

07:44.220 --> 07:46.900
 So humans feel safe doing it when they got a weapon.

07:48.180 --> 07:52.420
 Animals feel safe when they have a coalition,

07:52.420 --> 07:54.820
 a coalition that has overwhelming power

07:54.820 --> 07:56.700
 compared to the victim.

07:56.700 --> 07:59.420
 And so wolves will do that, and lions will do that,

07:59.420 --> 08:00.860
 and hyenas will do that,

08:00.860 --> 08:04.300
 and chimpanzees will do it, and humans do it too.

08:05.340 --> 08:08.460
 Can they pull themselves into something

08:08.460 --> 08:10.580
 that looks more like a symmetric war

08:10.580 --> 08:12.660
 as opposed to an asymmetric one?

08:12.660 --> 08:15.300
 So accidentally engaging on the lone individual

08:15.300 --> 08:17.220
 and getting themselves into trouble?

08:17.220 --> 08:21.380
 Are they more aggressive in avoiding these kinds of battles?

08:21.380 --> 08:24.060
 No, they're very keen to avoid those kinds of battles,

08:24.060 --> 08:27.660
 but occasionally they can make a mistake.

08:28.820 --> 08:32.340
 But so far, there have been no observations

08:32.340 --> 08:34.700
 of anything like a battle in which

08:34.700 --> 08:37.260
 both sides maintain themselves.

08:37.260 --> 08:40.260
 And I think you can very confidently say

08:40.260 --> 08:42.740
 that overwhelmingly what happens is that

08:42.740 --> 08:45.060
 if they discover that there's several individuals

08:45.060 --> 08:48.220
 on the other side, then both sides retreat.

08:48.220 --> 08:50.300
 Nobody wants to get hurt.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.020
 What they want to do is to hurt others.

08:52.020 --> 08:52.860
 Yes.

08:52.860 --> 08:56.660
 So you mentioned Jane Goodall, you've worked with her.

08:56.660 --> 08:58.140
 What was it like working with her?

08:58.140 --> 08:59.660
 What have you learned from her?

09:01.100 --> 09:04.740
 Well, she's a wonderfully independent, courageous person,

09:04.740 --> 09:09.740
 you know, who she famously began her studies

09:09.740 --> 09:14.740
 not as a qualified person in terms of education,

09:14.740 --> 09:19.740
 but qualified only by enthusiasm and considerable experience,

09:20.620 --> 09:22.940
 even in her early 20s, with nature.

09:24.740 --> 09:27.380
 So she's courageous in the sense of being able

09:27.380 --> 09:30.340
 to take on challenges.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.740
 The thing that is very impressive about her

09:32.740 --> 09:37.740
 is her total fidelity to the observations,

09:37.740 --> 09:42.740
 very unwilling to extend beyond the observations,

09:43.500 --> 09:45.500
 waiting until they mount up

09:45.500 --> 09:47.500
 and you've really got a confident picture,

09:49.140 --> 09:53.860
 and tremendous attention to individuals.

09:53.860 --> 09:57.460
 So that was an interesting problem from her point of view,

09:57.460 --> 10:02.460
 because when she got to know the chimpanzees of Gombe,

10:02.460 --> 10:05.380
 this particular community of Kazakia,

10:05.380 --> 10:08.020
 this particular community of Kazakia,

10:08.020 --> 10:09.420
 about 60 individuals.

10:10.900 --> 10:14.700
 So Gombe was in Tanzania on Lake Tanganyika.

10:14.700 --> 10:16.500
 She was there initially with her mother,

10:16.500 --> 10:20.420
 and then alone for two or three years

10:20.420 --> 10:22.620
 of really intense observation,

10:22.620 --> 10:24.820
 and then slowly joined by other people.

10:26.220 --> 10:31.220
 What she discovered was that there were obvious differences

10:31.620 --> 10:34.540
 in individual personality,

10:34.540 --> 10:35.860
 and the difficulty about that

10:35.860 --> 10:38.980
 was that when she reported this

10:38.980 --> 10:43.020
 to the largest scientific world,

10:43.020 --> 10:45.980
 initially her advisors at Cambridge,

10:47.460 --> 10:49.900
 they said, well, we don't know how to handle that,

10:49.900 --> 10:53.060
 because you've got to treat all these animals

10:53.060 --> 10:54.380
 as the same basically,

10:54.380 --> 10:59.380
 because there is no research tradition

11:00.460 --> 11:03.220
 of thinking about personalities.

11:03.220 --> 11:06.740
 Well, now, whatever it is, 60 years later,

11:07.820 --> 11:11.540
 the study of personalities is a very rich part

11:11.540 --> 11:13.220
 of the study of animal behavior.

11:14.660 --> 11:17.980
 At any rate, the important point in terms of what was she like

11:17.980 --> 11:19.220
 is that she stuck to her guns,

11:19.220 --> 11:23.340
 and she absolutely insisted that we have to show,

11:23.340 --> 11:25.260
 describe in great detail,

11:25.260 --> 11:28.380
 the differences in personality among these individuals,

11:28.380 --> 11:30.420
 and then you can leave it to the evolutionary biologist

11:30.420 --> 11:32.660
 to think about what it means.

11:32.660 --> 11:37.660
 So what is the process of observation like this like?

11:37.900 --> 11:39.260
 Observing the personality,

11:39.260 --> 11:41.580
 but also observing in a way

11:41.580 --> 11:45.580
 that's not projecting your beliefs about human nature

11:45.580 --> 11:48.820
 or animal nature onto chimps,

11:48.820 --> 11:52.580
 which is probably really tempting to project.

11:52.580 --> 11:55.980
 So your understanding of the way the human world works,

11:55.980 --> 11:59.460
 projecting that onto the chimp world.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.620
 Yes, I mean, it's particularly difficult with chimps

12:01.620 --> 12:05.220
 because chimps are so similar to humans in their behavior

12:05.220 --> 12:09.740
 that it's very easy to make those projections, as you say.

12:10.900 --> 12:14.860
 The process involves making very clear definitions

12:14.860 --> 12:16.940
 of what a behavior is.

12:18.460 --> 12:21.420
 Aggression can be defined

12:21.420 --> 12:25.620
 in terms of a forceful hit, a bite, and so on.

12:26.740 --> 12:30.340
 And writing down every time these things happen,

12:30.340 --> 12:32.700
 and then slowly totting up the numbers of times

12:32.700 --> 12:35.780
 that they happen from individual A

12:35.780 --> 12:37.860
 towards individuals B, C, D, and E,

12:39.140 --> 12:41.660
 so that you build up a very concrete picture

12:41.660 --> 12:43.820
 rather than interpreting at any point

12:43.820 --> 12:44.940
 and stopping and saying,

12:44.940 --> 12:47.420
 well, they seem to be rather aggressive.

12:48.460 --> 12:53.380
 So the formal system is that you build up a pattern

12:53.380 --> 12:57.420
 of the relationships based on a description

12:57.420 --> 12:59.540
 of the different types of interactions,

12:59.540 --> 13:02.060
 the aggressive and the friendly interactions,

13:03.140 --> 13:06.100
 and all of these are defined in concrete.

13:08.500 --> 13:12.340
 So from that, you extract a pattern of relationships,

13:12.340 --> 13:16.380
 and the relationships can be defined as

13:18.660 --> 13:22.500
 relatively friendly, relatively aggressive,

13:22.500 --> 13:25.140
 competitive based on the frequency

13:25.140 --> 13:27.500
 of these types of interactions.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.020
 And so one can talk in terms of individuals

13:31.020 --> 13:32.940
 having a relationship,

13:32.940 --> 13:35.060
 which on the scores of friendliness

13:35.060 --> 13:38.180
 is two standard deviations outside the mean.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.060
 I mean, you know, it's...

13:41.060 --> 13:44.660
 In which direction, sorry, both directions?

13:45.700 --> 13:48.020
 One, I mean, you know, that would be obviously,

13:48.020 --> 13:49.660
 the friendly ones would be the ones

13:49.660 --> 13:52.060
 who have exceptionally high rates

13:52.060 --> 13:54.460
 of spending time close to each other,

13:54.460 --> 13:56.580
 of touching each other in a gentle way,

13:56.580 --> 13:59.020
 of grooming each other,

13:59.020 --> 14:01.060
 and by the way, finding that those things

14:01.060 --> 14:03.380
 are correlated with each other.

14:03.380 --> 14:06.940
 So it's possible to define a friendship

14:06.940 --> 14:10.100
 with a capital F in a very systematic way,

14:10.100 --> 14:14.740
 and to compare that between individuals,

14:14.740 --> 14:18.740
 but also between communities of chimpanzees

14:18.740 --> 14:21.060
 and between different species.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.420
 So that, you know, we can say that in some species,

14:23.420 --> 14:26.860
 individuals have friends and others don't at all.

14:26.860 --> 14:29.660
 What about just because there's different personalities

14:29.660 --> 14:31.900
 and because they're so fascinating,

14:31.900 --> 14:33.620
 what about sort of falling in love

14:33.620 --> 14:37.220
 or forming friendships with chimps, you know?

14:37.220 --> 14:40.260
 Like really, you know,

14:40.260 --> 14:43.900
 connecting with them as an observer.

14:43.900 --> 14:46.340
 What role does that play?

14:46.340 --> 14:47.980
 Is you're tracking these individuals

14:47.980 --> 14:50.780
 that are full of life and intelligence

14:50.780 --> 14:55.620
 for long periods of time, plus as a human,

14:55.620 --> 14:58.140
 especially in those days for Jane,

14:58.140 --> 15:00.260
 she's alone observing it.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.060
 It gets lonely as a human.

15:02.060 --> 15:04.740
 I mean, probably deeply lonely as a human

15:04.740 --> 15:07.700
 being observed these other intelligent species.

15:07.700 --> 15:08.860
 It's a very reasonable question.

15:08.860 --> 15:11.580
 And of course, Jane in those early years,

15:11.580 --> 15:15.260
 I think she's willing now to talk about the fact

15:15.260 --> 15:21.420
 that she regrets to some extent how close she became.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.580
 And the problem is not just from the humans,

15:23.580 --> 15:25.420
 the problem is from the chimpanzees as well,

15:25.420 --> 15:31.580
 because they do things that are extremely affectionate,

15:31.580 --> 15:32.660
 if you like.

15:32.660 --> 15:39.660
 You know, at one point, Jane offered a ripe fruit

15:39.660 --> 15:42.260
 to a chimpanzee called David Greybeard.

15:42.260 --> 15:47.660
 David Greybeard took it and squeezed her hand,

15:47.660 --> 15:48.860
 as if to say thank you.

15:48.860 --> 15:53.500
 I think he gave it back, if I remember rightly.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.020
 No, thank you.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.340
 Right.

15:57.340 --> 16:01.740
 Oh, it's almost like thank you and returning the affection

16:01.740 --> 16:03.980
 by giving the fruit, if they did something.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.980
 You know, it was a gentle squeeze.

16:05.980 --> 16:08.100
 I mean, chimpanzees could squeeze you very hard,

16:08.100 --> 16:11.380
 as that occasionally has happened.

16:11.380 --> 16:14.620
 Some chimps are aggressive to people,

16:14.620 --> 16:16.660
 and others are friendly.

16:16.660 --> 16:18.180
 And the ones that are friendly tend

16:18.180 --> 16:20.220
 to be rather sympathetic characters,

16:20.220 --> 16:24.180
 because they might be ones who are having problems

16:24.180 --> 16:26.340
 in their own society.

16:26.340 --> 16:30.100
 So, Joe Mio in Gombe used to come and sit next to me

16:30.100 --> 16:34.420
 quite often, and he was having a hard time making it

16:34.420 --> 16:36.820
 in that society, which I can describe to you

16:36.820 --> 16:39.020
 in terms of the number of aggressive interactions,

16:39.020 --> 16:43.300
 if you want, but just to be informed about it.

16:43.300 --> 16:49.140
 So, all of this is a temptation to be very firmly resisted.

16:49.140 --> 16:52.260
 And in the community that I've been working with in Uganda

16:52.260 --> 16:56.060
 for the last 30 years, we try extremely hard to impress

16:56.060 --> 16:58.380
 on all of the research students who come with us,

16:58.380 --> 17:01.700
 that it is absolutely vital that you do not fall

17:01.700 --> 17:02.740
 into that temptation.

17:02.740 --> 17:07.020
 Now, we heard a story of one person who did reach out

17:07.020 --> 17:09.340
 and touch one of our chimps.

17:09.340 --> 17:13.220
 It's a very, very bad idea, not because the chimp

17:13.220 --> 17:18.540
 is going to do anything violent at the time,

17:18.540 --> 17:24.380
 but because if they learn that humans are as weak physically

17:24.380 --> 17:26.300
 as we are compared to them, then they

17:26.300 --> 17:28.780
 can take advantage of it, us.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.780
 And that's what happened in Gombe.

17:30.780 --> 17:35.340
 So after Jane had done the very obvious thing

17:35.340 --> 17:40.180
 when you're first engaged in this game of allowing

17:40.180 --> 17:42.780
 the infants to approach her and then tickling them

17:42.780 --> 17:47.420
 and playing with them, some of those infants

17:47.420 --> 17:50.900
 had the personality of wanting to take advantage

17:50.900 --> 17:53.340
 of that knowledge later.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.060
 And so you had an individual, Frodo,

17:56.060 --> 17:59.940
 who was violent on a regular basis towards humans

17:59.940 --> 18:01.820
 when he was an adult, and he was quite dangerous.

18:01.820 --> 18:03.060
 He could easily have killed someone.

18:03.060 --> 18:05.100
 In fact, he did kill one person.

18:05.100 --> 18:11.060
 He killed a baby that he took from a mother, a human baby

18:11.060 --> 18:15.260
 that he took off her hip when he met her on the path.

18:15.260 --> 18:20.860
 So it's a reminder that we're dealing with a species that

18:20.860 --> 18:24.500
 are rather human like in the range of emotions they have,

18:24.500 --> 18:28.660
 in the capacities they have, and even in the strength they

18:28.660 --> 18:33.140
 have, they are, in many ways, stronger than humans.

18:33.140 --> 18:37.220
 So you've got to be careful.

18:37.220 --> 18:39.980
 In the full range of friendliness and violence,

18:39.980 --> 18:44.100
 the capacity for these very human things.

18:44.100 --> 18:44.620
 Yes.

18:44.620 --> 18:47.340
 I mean, it's very obvious with violence,

18:47.340 --> 18:50.260
 as we talked about, that they will kill.

18:50.260 --> 18:53.340
 They will kill not just strangers.

18:53.340 --> 18:57.660
 They can kill other adults within their own group.

18:57.660 --> 18:59.700
 They can kill babies that are strangers.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.260
 They can kill babies in their own group.

19:01.260 --> 19:04.420
 So this is a long lived individual.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.700
 Obviously, these killings can't have very often,

19:06.700 --> 19:09.380
 because otherwise they'd all be dead.

19:09.380 --> 19:13.460
 And we're now finding that they can live to 50 or 60 years

19:13.460 --> 19:16.180
 in the wild at relatively low population density,

19:16.180 --> 19:18.620
 because they're big animals eating a rather specialized

19:18.620 --> 19:22.420
 kind of food, the ripe fruits.

19:22.420 --> 19:23.940
 So it doesn't happen all the time.

19:23.940 --> 19:28.820
 With friendliness, they are very strong to support each other.

19:28.820 --> 19:34.660
 They very much depend on their close friendships,

19:34.660 --> 19:38.940
 which they express through physical contact,

19:38.940 --> 19:41.620
 and particularly through grooming.

19:41.620 --> 19:46.140
 So grooming occurs when one individual approaches another.

19:46.140 --> 19:50.820
 I might present for grooming, a very common way of starting,

19:50.820 --> 19:53.500
 turning their back or presenting an arm or something

19:53.500 --> 19:56.020
 like that, and the other just riffles their fingers

19:56.020 --> 19:57.820
 through the hair.

19:57.820 --> 20:00.500
 And that's partly just soothing.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.340
 And it's partly looking for parasites,

20:04.340 --> 20:06.380
 but mostly it's just soothing.

20:06.380 --> 20:12.020
 And the point about this is it can go on for half an hour.

20:12.020 --> 20:15.420
 It can go on for sometimes even an hour.

20:15.420 --> 20:21.300
 So this is a major expression of interest in somebody else.

20:21.300 --> 20:26.780
 When did your interest in this one particular aspect of Chim

20:26.780 --> 20:28.900
 come to be, which is violence?

20:28.900 --> 20:32.980
 When did the study of violence in Chim's become something

20:32.980 --> 20:35.740
 you're deeply interested in?

20:35.740 --> 20:41.460
 Well, for my PhD in the early 1970s,

20:41.460 --> 20:43.980
 I was in Gombe with Jane Goodall and was

20:43.980 --> 20:46.140
 studying feeding behavior.

20:46.140 --> 20:49.060
 But during that time, we were seeing,

20:49.060 --> 20:53.740
 and I say we because there were half a dozen research students

20:53.740 --> 21:00.180
 all in her camp, we were discovering

21:00.180 --> 21:05.020
 that Chim's had this capacity for violence.

21:05.020 --> 21:07.500
 The first kill happened during that time,

21:07.500 --> 21:11.660
 which was of an infant and a neighboring group.

21:11.660 --> 21:16.060
 And we were starting to see these hunting expeditions.

21:16.060 --> 21:18.820
 And this was the start of my interest

21:18.820 --> 21:21.780
 because it was such chilling evidence

21:21.780 --> 21:28.340
 of an extraordinary similarity between Chim's and humans.

21:28.340 --> 21:32.300
 Now, at that time, we didn't know very much

21:32.300 --> 21:36.100
 about how chimpanzees and humans were related.

21:36.100 --> 21:41.460
 Chimps, gorillas, bonobos are all three big black hairy things

21:41.460 --> 21:46.860
 that live in the African forests and eat fruits and leaves

21:46.860 --> 21:50.220
 when they can't find fruits and walk on their knuckles.

21:50.220 --> 21:51.780
 And they all look rather similar to each other.

21:51.780 --> 21:54.780
 So they seem as though those three species,

21:54.780 --> 21:56.700
 chimps and gorillas and bonobos,

21:56.700 --> 21:59.380
 should all be each other's closest relatives.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.500
 And humans are something rather separate.

22:01.500 --> 22:04.660
 And so any of them would be of interest to us.

22:04.660 --> 22:08.540
 Subsequently, we learn that actually that's not true

22:08.540 --> 22:11.300
 and that there's a special relationship between humans

22:11.300 --> 22:13.340
 and chimpanzees.

22:13.340 --> 22:15.900
 But at the time, even without knowing that,

22:15.900 --> 22:20.020
 it was obvious that there was something very odd about chimpanzees

22:20.020 --> 22:25.380
 because Jane had discovered they were making tools.

22:25.380 --> 22:29.020
 She had seen that they were hunting meat.

22:29.020 --> 22:33.140
 She had seen that they were sharing the meat among each other.

22:33.140 --> 22:36.420
 She had seen that the societies were dominated politically

22:36.420 --> 22:38.620
 by males, coalitions of males.

22:38.620 --> 22:43.100
 All of these things, of course, resonate so closely with humans.

22:43.100 --> 22:47.340
 And then it turns out that in contrast

22:47.340 --> 22:50.020
 to conventional wisdom at the time,

22:50.020 --> 22:53.740
 the chimpanzees were capable of hunting and killing

22:53.740 --> 22:56.620
 members of neighboring groups.

22:56.620 --> 23:00.340
 Well, at that point, the similarities

23:00.340 --> 23:04.020
 between chimps and humans become less

23:04.020 --> 23:09.140
 a matter of sheer intellectual fascination

23:09.140 --> 23:11.500
 than something that has a really deep meaning

23:11.500 --> 23:15.580
 about our understanding of ourselves.

23:15.580 --> 23:19.700
 I mean, until then, you can cheerfully think of humans

23:19.700 --> 23:22.940
 as a species apart from the rest of nature

23:22.940 --> 23:24.740
 because we are so peculiar.

23:24.740 --> 23:28.460
 But when it turns out that, as it turns out,

23:28.460 --> 23:33.420
 one of our two closest relatives has got these features

23:33.420 --> 23:36.580
 that we share and that one of the features

23:36.580 --> 23:41.380
 is something that is the most horrendous, as well as

23:41.380 --> 23:44.580
 fascinating, aspect of human behavior,

23:44.580 --> 23:48.060
 then how can you resist just trying

23:48.060 --> 23:49.940
 to find out what's going on?

23:49.940 --> 23:51.620
 So I have to say this.

23:51.620 --> 23:54.380
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with a man,

23:54.380 --> 23:56.300
 but fans of this podcast are.

23:56.300 --> 23:58.460
 So we're talking about chimps.

23:58.460 --> 23:59.940
 We're talking about violence.

23:59.940 --> 24:04.300
 My now friend, Mr. Joe Rogan, is a big fan of those things.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.140
 I'm a big fan of these topics.

24:06.140 --> 24:10.140
 I think a lot of people are fascinated by these topics.

24:10.140 --> 24:17.540
 So as you're saying, why do we find the exploration of violence

24:17.540 --> 24:20.860
 and the relations between chimps so interesting?

24:20.860 --> 24:23.380
 What can they teach us about ourselves?

24:26.180 --> 24:29.820
 Until we had this information about chimpanzees,

24:29.820 --> 24:40.100
 it was possible to believe that the psychology behind warfare

24:40.100 --> 24:44.580
 was totally the result of some kind

24:44.580 --> 24:50.100
 of recent cultural innovation that had nothing

24:50.100 --> 24:53.260
 to do with our biology, or if you like,

24:53.260 --> 24:58.620
 that it's got something to do with sin and God and the devil

24:58.620 --> 25:00.900
 and that sort of thing.

25:00.900 --> 25:08.100
 But what the chimps tell us after we think carefully about it

25:08.100 --> 25:11.660
 is that it seems undoubtedly the case

25:11.660 --> 25:18.460
 that our evolutionary psychology has given us

25:18.460 --> 25:22.660
 the same kind of attitude towards violence

25:22.660 --> 25:26.420
 as occurred in chimpanzees.

25:26.420 --> 25:29.340
 And in both species, it has evolved

25:29.340 --> 25:32.060
 because of its evolutionary significance.

25:32.060 --> 25:36.060
 In other words, because it's been helpful to the individuals

25:36.060 --> 25:37.820
 who have practiced it.

25:37.820 --> 25:41.860
 And now we know that, as I mentioned,

25:41.860 --> 25:44.140
 other species do this as well.

25:44.140 --> 25:49.380
 In fact, wolves, which this is a really kind

25:49.380 --> 25:54.940
 of an ironical observation, Conrad Lorenz, who I mentioned,

25:54.940 --> 25:59.620
 had been the person who thought that human aggression

25:59.620 --> 26:01.980
 in the form of killing members of our own species

26:01.980 --> 26:04.100
 was unique to our species.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.580
 He was a great fan of wolves.

26:05.580 --> 26:06.980
 He studied wolves.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.900
 And in captivity, he noted that wolves

26:09.900 --> 26:15.060
 are very unlikely to harm each other in spats

26:15.060 --> 26:17.420
 among members of the same group.

26:17.420 --> 26:19.140
 What happens is that one of them will roll over

26:19.140 --> 26:22.380
 and present their neck, much as you see in a dog park nowadays.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.700
 And the other might put their jaws on the neck,

26:25.700 --> 26:27.780
 but will not bite.

26:27.780 --> 26:31.860
 OK, so now it turns out that if you study wolves in the wild,

26:31.860 --> 26:36.740
 then neighboring packs often go hunting for each other.

26:36.740 --> 26:39.300
 They are in fierce competition.

26:39.300 --> 26:43.700
 And as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves

26:43.700 --> 26:48.300
 is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.300
 So it's a really serious business.

26:51.300 --> 26:55.500
 The chimpanzees and humans fit into a larger pattern

26:55.500 --> 27:00.140
 of understanding animals in which you don't

27:00.140 --> 27:02.020
 have an instinct for violence.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.100
 What you have is an instinct, if you like,

27:05.100 --> 27:07.780
 to use violence adaptively.

27:07.780 --> 27:11.700
 And if the right circumstances come up, it'll be adaptive.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.740
 If the right circumstances don't come up, it won't be.

27:14.740 --> 27:17.940
 So some chimpanzee communities are much more

27:17.940 --> 27:20.180
 violent than others because of things

27:20.180 --> 27:25.140
 like the frequency with which a large party of males

27:25.140 --> 27:28.020
 is likely to meet a lone victim.

27:28.020 --> 27:31.860
 And that's going to depend on the local ecology.

27:31.860 --> 27:37.020
 But the overall answer to the question of what a chimps teach

27:37.020 --> 27:41.540
 us is that we have to take very seriously the notion

27:41.540 --> 27:47.780
 that in humans, the tendency to make war

27:47.780 --> 27:52.420
 is a consequence of a long term evolutionary adaptation

27:52.420 --> 27:58.380
 and not just a military ideology or some local patriarchal

27:58.380 --> 28:00.420
 phenomenon.

28:00.420 --> 28:03.020
 And of course, a reading of history,

28:03.020 --> 28:07.100
 a judicious reading of history, fits that very easily

28:07.100 --> 28:10.780
 because war is so commonplace.

28:10.780 --> 28:11.780
 It's not an accident.

28:11.780 --> 28:15.460
 So it's not a construction of human civilization.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.540
 It's deeply within us, violence.

28:17.540 --> 28:20.420
 So what's the difference between violence

28:20.420 --> 28:24.700
 on the individual level versus group?

28:24.700 --> 28:26.860
 It seems like with chimps and with wolves,

28:26.860 --> 28:32.700
 there's something about the dynamic of multiple chimps

28:32.700 --> 28:36.260
 together that increase the chance of violence.

28:36.260 --> 28:39.540
 Or is violence still fundamentally

28:39.540 --> 28:40.980
 part of the individual?

28:40.980 --> 28:45.940
 Like would an individual be as violent as they might

28:45.940 --> 28:47.940
 be as part of a group?

28:47.940 --> 28:53.220
 If we're talking about killing, then violence

28:53.220 --> 28:56.100
 in the sense of killing is very much associated

28:56.100 --> 28:59.020
 with a group.

28:59.020 --> 29:02.820
 And the reason is that individuals

29:02.820 --> 29:06.860
 don't benefit by getting into a fight in which they risk being

29:06.860 --> 29:08.700
 hurt themselves.

29:08.700 --> 29:12.660
 So it's only when you have overwhelming power

29:12.660 --> 29:16.740
 that the temptation to try and kill another victim

29:16.740 --> 29:21.620
 rises sufficiently for them to be motivated to do it.

29:21.620 --> 29:27.860
 The average number of chimpanzee males

29:27.860 --> 29:33.140
 that attack a single male in something like 50 observations

29:33.140 --> 29:35.940
 that have accumulated in the last 50 years

29:35.940 --> 29:40.220
 from various different study sites is eight.

29:40.220 --> 29:41.900
 Eight to one.

29:41.900 --> 29:46.780
 Now, sometimes it can go as low as three to one.

29:46.780 --> 29:49.420
 But that's getting risky.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.660
 But if you have eight, you can see what can happen.

29:51.660 --> 29:55.860
 I mean, basically, you have one male on one foot,

29:55.860 --> 29:58.060
 another male on another foot, another male on an arm,

29:58.060 --> 29:59.620
 another male on another arm.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.460
 Now you have an immobilized victim

30:02.460 --> 30:06.260
 with four individuals capable of just doing the damage.

30:06.260 --> 30:07.980
 And so they can then move in and tear out

30:07.980 --> 30:10.140
 his thorax and tear off his testicles

30:10.140 --> 30:12.540
 and twist an arm until it breaks.

30:12.540 --> 30:18.460
 And do this appalling damage with no weapons.

30:18.460 --> 30:23.620
 What is the way in which they prefer to commit the violence?

30:23.620 --> 30:27.780
 Is there something to be said about the actual process of it?

30:27.780 --> 30:29.340
 Is there an artistry to it?

30:29.340 --> 30:32.380
 So if you look at human warfare,

30:32.380 --> 30:34.140
 there's different parts in history

30:34.140 --> 30:37.820
 prefer different kind of approaches to violence.

30:37.820 --> 30:41.180
 It had more to do with tools, I think, on the human side.

30:41.180 --> 30:44.740
 But just the nature of violence itself,

30:44.740 --> 30:47.500
 sorry, the practice, the strategy of violence,

30:47.500 --> 30:49.100
 is it basically the same?

30:49.100 --> 30:53.420
 You improvise, you immobilize the victim,

30:53.420 --> 30:55.500
 and they just rip off different parts of their body

30:55.500 --> 30:56.780
 kind of thing.

30:56.780 --> 31:00.700
 Yeah, you have to understand that these things are happening

31:00.700 --> 31:06.140
 at high speed in thick vegetation, mostly.

31:06.140 --> 31:10.180
 So they have not been filmed carefully.

31:10.180 --> 31:13.660
 We have a few little glimpses of them

31:13.660 --> 31:16.540
 from one or two people like David Watts.

31:16.540 --> 31:17.900
 He's got some great video.

31:17.900 --> 31:21.340
 But we don't know enough to be able to say that.

31:21.340 --> 31:24.020
 It's hard for me to imagine that there are styles that

31:24.020 --> 31:28.420
 vary between communities, cultural styles.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.140
 But it is possible.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.980
 And one thing that is striking is

31:32.980 --> 31:37.300
 that the number of times that an individual victim has

31:37.300 --> 31:43.340
 been killed immediately has been higher in Kibali

31:43.340 --> 31:48.620
 forest in Uganda than in Gombe National Park in Tanzania.

31:48.620 --> 31:50.140
 It's conceivable that's just chance.

31:50.140 --> 31:51.860
 We don't have real numbers now.

31:51.860 --> 31:55.380
 But I can't remember exact numbers.

31:55.380 --> 32:00.140
 But 10 versus 15 or something.

32:00.140 --> 32:06.420
 So maybe they damage to the point of expecting a death

32:06.420 --> 32:09.140
 in one place, and they just finish it off in the other.

32:09.140 --> 32:12.060
 But most likely, that sort of difference

32:12.060 --> 32:17.100
 will be due to differences in the numbers of attackers.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.860
 You know, human beings are able to conceive

32:19.860 --> 32:23.380
 of the philosophical notion of death, of mortality.

32:23.380 --> 32:29.340
 Is there any of that for chimps when they're

32:29.340 --> 32:30.460
 thinking about violence?

32:30.460 --> 32:33.500
 Is violence, like what is the nature

32:33.500 --> 32:36.500
 of their conception of violence, do you think?

32:36.500 --> 32:41.580
 Do they realize they're taking another conscious being's life?

32:41.580 --> 32:45.940
 Or is it some kind of optimization

32:45.940 --> 32:50.500
 over the use of resources or something like that?

32:50.500 --> 32:52.380
 I don't think it's.

32:52.380 --> 32:54.220
 I can't think of any way to get an answer

32:54.220 --> 32:58.020
 to the question of what they know about that.

32:58.020 --> 33:03.220
 I think that the way to think about the motivation

33:03.220 --> 33:09.780
 is rather like the motivation in sex.

33:09.780 --> 33:14.540
 So when males are interested in having sex with a female,

33:14.540 --> 33:18.780
 whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans,

33:18.780 --> 33:21.940
 they don't think about the fact that what this is going to do

33:21.940 --> 33:24.060
 is to lead to a baby.

33:24.060 --> 33:25.180
 Mostly.

33:25.180 --> 33:25.860
 You're right.

33:25.860 --> 33:27.540
 Mostly what they're thinking about is,

33:27.540 --> 33:29.820
 I want to get my end away.

33:29.820 --> 33:34.420
 And I think that it's a similar kind of process

33:34.420 --> 33:35.700
 with the chimps.

33:35.700 --> 33:38.980
 What they are thinking about is, I

33:38.980 --> 33:41.620
 want to kill this individual.

33:41.620 --> 33:46.780
 And it's hard to imagine that taking the other individual's

33:46.780 --> 33:50.180
 perspective and thinking about what it means for them to die

33:50.180 --> 33:51.700
 is going to be an important part of that.

33:51.700 --> 33:54.180
 In fact, there's reasons to think it should not

33:54.180 --> 33:56.620
 be an important part of it because it might inhibit them.

33:56.620 --> 33:57.900
 They don't want to be inhibited.

33:57.900 --> 34:01.500
 The more efficient they are in doing this, the better.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.180
 But I think it's interesting to think

34:03.180 --> 34:04.700
 about this whole motivational question

34:04.700 --> 34:09.740
 because it does produce the sort of rather haunting thought

34:09.740 --> 34:14.580
 that there has been selection in favor of enthusiasm

34:14.580 --> 34:16.980
 about killing.

34:16.980 --> 34:24.740
 And in our relatively gentle and deliberately moral society

34:24.740 --> 34:27.940
 that we have today, it's very difficult for us

34:27.940 --> 34:32.460
 to face the thought that in all of us,

34:32.460 --> 34:38.700
 there might have been a residue and more than that,

34:38.700 --> 34:43.580
 sort of an active potential for that thought

34:43.580 --> 34:47.620
 of really enjoying killing someone else.

34:47.620 --> 34:52.580
 But I think one can sustain that thought fairly obviously

34:52.580 --> 34:57.940
 by thinking of circumstances in which it would be true

34:57.940 --> 35:04.220
 that the ordinary human male would be delighted to be part

35:04.220 --> 35:06.620
 of a group that was killing someone.

35:06.620 --> 35:10.380
 What you've got to do is to be in a position

35:10.380 --> 35:14.220
 where you're regarding the victim as dangerous

35:14.220 --> 35:17.580
 and thoroughly hostile.

35:17.580 --> 35:21.780
 But the pure enjoyment of violence.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.700
 I don't know if you know this historian, Dan Carlin.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.060
 He has a podcast.

35:26.060 --> 35:32.020
 He has an episode, three, four hour episode

35:32.020 --> 35:33.180
 that I recommend to others.

35:33.180 --> 35:34.860
 It's quite haunting.

35:34.860 --> 35:38.260
 But he takes us through an entire history.

35:38.260 --> 35:40.700
 It's called pain foetainment.

35:40.700 --> 35:47.620
 The history of humans enjoying the murder of others

35:47.620 --> 35:48.820
 in a large group.

35:48.820 --> 35:51.740
 So like public executions were part of,

35:51.740 --> 35:53.540
 long part of human history.

35:53.540 --> 35:58.980
 And there's something that for some reason humans seem

35:58.980 --> 36:03.260
 to have been drawn to just watching others die.

36:03.260 --> 36:06.740
 And he ventures to say that that may still be part of us.

36:06.740 --> 36:11.340
 For example, he said if it was possible to televise,

36:11.340 --> 36:15.300
 to stream online, for example, the execution and the murder

36:15.300 --> 36:17.940
 of somebody or even the torture of somebody,

36:17.940 --> 36:22.740
 that a very large fraction of the population

36:22.740 --> 36:24.940
 on Earth would not be able to look away.

36:24.940 --> 36:26.700
 They'd be drawn to that somehow.

36:26.700 --> 36:31.660
 That's a very dark thought that we were drawn to that.

36:31.660 --> 36:33.940
 So you think that's part of us in there somewhere.

36:33.940 --> 36:39.260
 That selection that we evolved for the enjoyment of killing

36:39.260 --> 36:46.740
 and the enjoyment of observing those in our tribe doing

36:46.740 --> 36:48.260
 the killing.

36:48.260 --> 36:48.700
 Yes.

36:48.700 --> 36:51.100
 I mean, and that word you produced at the end

36:51.100 --> 36:56.220
 is critical, I think, because it would be a little bit weird,

36:56.220 --> 37:02.020
 I think, to imagine a lot of enjoyment about people

37:02.020 --> 37:03.580
 in your own tribe being killed.

37:03.580 --> 37:04.580
 Right.

37:04.580 --> 37:07.620
 I don't think we're interested in violence for violence's sake

37:07.620 --> 37:09.820
 that much.

37:09.820 --> 37:15.340
 It's when you get these social boundaries set up.

37:15.340 --> 37:25.620
 And in today's world, happily, we kind of are already one world.

37:25.620 --> 37:29.140
 You have to dehumanise someone to get to the point

37:29.140 --> 37:34.140
 where they are really outside our recognition of a tribe

37:34.140 --> 37:37.300
 at some level, which is the whole human species.

37:37.300 --> 37:41.100
 But in ancient times, that would not have been true.

37:41.100 --> 37:44.340
 Because in ancient times, there are

37:44.340 --> 37:47.220
 lots of accounts of hunters and gatherers

37:47.220 --> 37:51.900
 in which the appearance of a stranger

37:51.900 --> 37:57.380
 would lead to an immediate response of shooting on site.

37:57.380 --> 38:00.540
 Because what was human was the people

38:00.540 --> 38:03.180
 that were in your society.

38:03.180 --> 38:06.100
 And the other things that actually looked like us

38:06.100 --> 38:10.660
 and were human in that sense were not regarded as human.

38:10.660 --> 38:13.620
 So there was a kind of automatic dehumanisation

38:13.620 --> 38:16.140
 of everybody that didn't speak our language

38:16.140 --> 38:23.300
 or hadn't already somehow become recognised as sufficiently

38:23.300 --> 38:27.780
 like us to escape the dehumanisation context.

38:27.780 --> 38:29.980
 And so hopefully the story of human history

38:29.980 --> 38:35.260
 is that we are that tribalism fades away,

38:35.260 --> 38:39.100
 that our dehumanisation, the natural desire to dehumanise

38:39.100 --> 38:42.740
 or tendency to dehumanise groups that are not

38:42.740 --> 38:45.820
 within this tribe decreases over time.

38:45.820 --> 38:49.740
 And so then the desire for violence decreases over time.

38:49.740 --> 38:52.500
 Yeah, I mean, that's the optimistic perspective.

38:52.500 --> 38:56.220
 And the great sort of concern, of course,

38:56.220 --> 39:00.340
 is that small conflicts can build up into bigger conflicts

39:00.340 --> 39:04.780
 and then dehumanisation happens and then violence is released.

39:04.780 --> 39:07.220
 As Hannah Arendt says, there currently

39:07.220 --> 39:12.260
 is no known alternative to war as a means of settling

39:12.260 --> 39:16.540
 really important conflicts.

39:16.540 --> 39:20.820
 So if we look at the big picture, what role has violence

39:20.820 --> 39:22.500
 or do you think violence has played

39:22.500 --> 39:25.020
 in the evolution of Homo sapiens?

39:25.020 --> 39:29.660
 So we are quite an intelligent, got a beautiful,

39:29.660 --> 39:34.180
 particular little branch on the evolutionary tree.

39:34.180 --> 39:38.900
 What part of that was played by our tendency to be violent?

39:38.900 --> 39:41.140
 Well, I think that violence was responsible

39:41.140 --> 39:43.500
 for creating your Homo sapiens.

39:46.340 --> 39:52.220
 And that raises the question of what Homo sapiens is.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.220
 Yes.

39:54.220 --> 39:56.220
 Yeah, exactly.

39:56.220 --> 40:05.580
 So nowadays people begin the concept of what Homo sapiens is

40:05.580 --> 40:09.460
 by thinking about features that are very obviously different

40:09.460 --> 40:12.460
 from all of the other species of Homo.

40:12.460 --> 40:18.260
 And our large brain, our very rounded cranium,

40:18.260 --> 40:21.340
 our relatively small face, these are characteristics

40:21.340 --> 40:24.780
 which are developed in a relatively modern way

40:24.780 --> 40:28.820
 by about 170,000 years ago, say, you know,

40:28.820 --> 40:31.020
 it's one of the earliest skulls in Africa

40:31.020 --> 40:33.020
 that really captures that.

40:33.020 --> 40:40.820
 But it has been argued that that is an episode

40:40.820 --> 40:46.860
 in a process that has been started substantially earlier.

40:46.860 --> 40:48.460
 And there's no doubt that that's true.

40:48.460 --> 40:51.700
 Homo sapiens is a species that has been changing

40:51.700 --> 40:56.700
 pretty continuously throughout the length of time it's there.

40:56.700 --> 40:59.700
 And it goes back to 300,000 years ago,

40:59.700 --> 41:05.300
 315, naturally, is the time, the best estimate of a date

41:05.300 --> 41:11.140
 for a series of bones from Morocco that have been dated

41:11.140 --> 41:13.420
 three or four years ago at that time

41:13.420 --> 41:17.620
 and have been characterized as earliest Homo sapiens.

41:17.620 --> 41:22.060
 Now, at that point, they are only beginning

41:22.060 --> 41:24.220
 the trend of sapienization.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.620
 And that trend consists basically

41:26.620 --> 41:32.940
 of grassanization, of making our ancestors less robust,

41:32.940 --> 41:36.780
 shorter faces, smaller teeth, smaller brow ridge,

41:36.780 --> 41:41.540
 narrower face, thinner cranium,

41:41.540 --> 41:47.860
 all these things that are associated with reduced violence.

41:47.860 --> 41:52.340
 OK, so that's saying what, that's Homo sapiens beginning.

41:52.340 --> 41:56.660
 So it began sometime 300,000 to 400,000 years ago,

41:56.660 --> 41:58.660
 because by 315,000 years ago, you've already

41:58.660 --> 42:00.100
 got something recognizable.

42:00.100 --> 42:02.060
 So you're more on that side of things

42:02.060 --> 42:03.500
 that those are this gradual process.

42:03.500 --> 42:06.100
 It's not 150,000, 170,000 years ago.

42:06.100 --> 42:11.060
 It started like 400,000 years ago, and it's just.

42:11.060 --> 42:13.140
 It started 300,000 to 400,000 years ago.

42:13.140 --> 42:16.700
 And if you look at 170,000, it's got even more like us.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.900
 And if you look at 100,000, it's got

42:19.900 --> 42:23.500
 100,000, if you look at 100,000, it's got more like us again.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.380
 And if you look at 50,000, it's more like us again.

42:25.380 --> 42:26.300
 It's all the way.

42:26.300 --> 42:29.100
 It's just getting more and more like the moderns.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.220
 So the question is, what happened between 300,000

42:31.220 --> 42:34.660
 and 400,000 years ago to produce Homo sapiens?

42:34.660 --> 42:38.060
 And I think we have a pretty good answer now.

42:38.060 --> 42:40.100
 And the answer comes from violence.

42:40.100 --> 42:44.060
 And the story begins by focusing on this question.

42:44.060 --> 42:49.060
 Why is it that in the human species,

42:49.060 --> 42:53.220
 we are unique among all primates in not having

42:53.220 --> 42:57.660
 an alpha male in any group in the sense

42:57.660 --> 43:01.900
 that what we don't have is an alpha male who personally beats

43:01.900 --> 43:05.220
 up every other male?

43:05.220 --> 43:13.580
 And the answer that has been portrayed most richly

43:13.580 --> 43:18.700
 by Christopher Boehm and whose work I've elaborated on

43:18.700 --> 43:25.940
 is that only in humans do you have a system by which

43:25.940 --> 43:31.460
 any male who tries to bully others and become the alpha

43:31.460 --> 43:34.260
 equivalent to an alpha gorilla or an alpha chimpanzee

43:34.260 --> 43:37.460
 or an alpha bonobo or an alpha baboon or anything like that,

43:37.460 --> 43:40.540
 any male who tries to do that in humans

43:40.540 --> 43:44.220
 gets taken down by a coalition of beta males.

43:46.620 --> 43:47.820
 That coalition?

43:47.820 --> 43:49.220
 Yes.

43:49.220 --> 43:52.100
 It's a really good picture of human society, yes.

43:52.100 --> 43:52.780
 I like it.

43:52.780 --> 43:53.700
 OK.

43:53.700 --> 43:55.540
 And that's the way all our societies work now.

43:55.540 --> 43:56.420
 Yes.

43:56.420 --> 43:58.620
 Because individuals try and be alpha

43:58.620 --> 43:59.980
 and then they get taken out.

43:59.980 --> 44:01.940
 Yeah, I mean, we don't usually think of ourselves

44:01.940 --> 44:06.420
 as beta males, but yes, I suppose that's what democracy is.

44:06.420 --> 44:07.620
 Exactly, yes.

44:07.620 --> 44:09.780
 Exactly.

44:09.780 --> 44:14.500
 OK, so at some point, alpha males get taken out.

44:14.500 --> 44:16.740
 Well, what alpha males are are males

44:16.740 --> 44:20.580
 who respond with high reactive violence

44:20.580 --> 44:22.700
 to any challenge to their status.

44:22.700 --> 44:25.020
 You see it all the time in primates.

44:25.020 --> 44:27.980
 Some beta male thinks he's getting strong

44:27.980 --> 44:31.620
 and maturing in wisdom and so on,

44:31.620 --> 44:35.820
 and he refuses to kowtow to the alpha male.

44:35.820 --> 44:39.300
 And the alpha male comes straight in and charges at him.

44:39.300 --> 44:42.100
 Or maybe he'll just wait for a few minutes or over

44:42.100 --> 44:46.260
 and then take an opportunity to attack him.

44:46.260 --> 44:51.260
 All of these primates have got a high tendency

44:51.260 --> 44:53.900
 for reactive aggression, and that

44:53.900 --> 44:56.340
 enables the possibility of alpha males.

44:56.340 --> 44:57.140
 We don't.

44:57.140 --> 45:00.340
 We have this great reduction, as I talked about earlier.

45:00.340 --> 45:03.940
 And the question is, when did that reduction happen?

45:03.940 --> 45:08.460
 Well, cut to the famous experiments

45:08.460 --> 45:12.820
 by the Russian biologist Dmitry Believ, who

45:12.820 --> 45:17.540
 tried domesticating wild animals.

45:17.540 --> 45:19.860
 When you domesticate wild animals,

45:19.860 --> 45:24.620
 what you're doing is reducing reactive aggression.

45:24.620 --> 45:26.740
 You are selecting those individuals

45:26.740 --> 45:31.900
 to breed who are most willing to be approached by a human

45:31.900 --> 45:34.300
 or by another member of their own species

45:34.300 --> 45:39.940
 and are least likely to erupt in a reactive aggression.

45:39.940 --> 45:42.900
 And you only have to do that for a few generations

45:42.900 --> 45:47.020
 to discover that there are changes in the skull.

45:47.020 --> 45:57.020
 And those changes consist of shorter face, smaller teeth,

45:57.020 --> 45:59.300
 reduced maleness.

45:59.300 --> 46:03.100
 The males become increasingly female like,

46:03.100 --> 46:06.300
 and reduced brain size.

46:06.300 --> 46:08.380
 Well, the changes that are characteristic

46:08.380 --> 46:11.860
 of domesticated animals in general compared to wild animals

46:11.860 --> 46:16.620
 are all found in homo sapiens compared to our early ancestors.

46:16.620 --> 46:19.860
 So it's a very strong signal that when we first

46:19.860 --> 46:21.740
 see homo sapiens, what we're seeing

46:21.740 --> 46:26.220
 is evidence of a reduction in reactive aggression.

46:26.220 --> 46:29.340
 And that suggests that what's happening with homo sapiens

46:29.340 --> 46:33.460
 is that that is the point at which there is selection

46:33.460 --> 46:35.460
 against the alpha males.

46:35.460 --> 46:39.300
 And therefore, the way in which the selection happened

46:39.300 --> 46:41.460
 would have been the way it happens today.

46:41.460 --> 46:44.180
 The beta males take them out.

46:44.180 --> 46:49.020
 So I think that homo sapiens is a species characterized

46:49.020 --> 46:53.260
 by the suppression of reactive aggression

46:53.260 --> 46:55.340
 as a kind of incidental consequence

46:55.340 --> 46:58.460
 of the suppression of the alpha male.

46:58.460 --> 47:01.780
 And the story of our species is the story

47:01.780 --> 47:06.620
 of how the beta males took charge and have

47:06.620 --> 47:11.300
 been responsible for the generation of a new kind

47:11.300 --> 47:21.140
 of human and, incidentally, for imposing on the society

47:21.140 --> 47:24.180
 a new set of values.

47:24.180 --> 47:26.700
 Because when those beta males discovered

47:26.700 --> 47:29.900
 that they could take out the previous alpha male

47:29.900 --> 47:32.180
 and continue to do so, because in every generation,

47:32.180 --> 47:34.100
 there'll always be some male who says,

47:34.100 --> 47:36.180
 maybe I'll become the alpha male.

47:36.180 --> 47:39.580
 So they just keep chopping them down.

47:39.580 --> 47:42.380
 In discovering that, they also obviously discovered

47:42.380 --> 47:46.580
 that they could kill anybody in the group, females,

47:46.580 --> 47:52.940
 young males, anybody who didn't follow their values.

47:52.940 --> 47:59.580
 And so this story is one in which the males of our species,

47:59.580 --> 48:02.980
 and these would be the breeding males,

48:02.980 --> 48:06.740
 have been able to impose their values on everybody else.

48:06.740 --> 48:08.100
 And there is two kind of values.

48:08.100 --> 48:09.620
 There's one kind of value is things

48:09.620 --> 48:13.900
 that are good for the group, like thou shalt not murder.

48:13.900 --> 48:16.060
 And the other kind of value is things

48:16.060 --> 48:21.180
 that are good for the males, such as, hey, guess what?

48:21.180 --> 48:23.420
 When good food comes in, males get it first.

48:23.420 --> 48:25.500
 Yes.

48:25.500 --> 48:28.460
 I mean, it's fascinating that that kind of set of ideals

48:28.460 --> 48:32.980
 could outcompete the others.

48:32.980 --> 48:35.340
 Do you have a sense of why?

48:35.340 --> 48:37.420
 Or maybe you can comment on Neanderthals

48:37.420 --> 48:39.180
 and all the other early humans.

48:39.180 --> 48:44.300
 Why did homo sapiens come to succeed and flourish

48:44.300 --> 48:50.540
 and all the other branches of evolution died out?

48:50.540 --> 48:51.700
 Or got murdered out?

48:51.700 --> 48:55.980
 Nowadays, when homo sapiens meet homo sapiens,

48:55.980 --> 48:59.140
 and we don't know each other initially,

48:59.140 --> 49:05.540
 then conflict breaks out, and the more militarily able group

49:05.540 --> 49:06.900
 wins.

49:06.900 --> 49:10.900
 We've seen that everywhere throughout the age of exploration

49:10.900 --> 49:14.300
 and throughout history.

49:14.300 --> 49:16.100
 So I'm rather surprised.

49:16.100 --> 49:20.420
 The conventional wisdom that you see nowadays

49:20.420 --> 49:23.620
 in contemporary anthropology is very

49:23.620 --> 49:28.260
 reluctant to point to success in warfare

49:28.260 --> 49:32.380
 as the reason why sapiens wiped out Neanderthals

49:32.380 --> 49:35.820
 within about 3,000 years of the sapiens coming

49:35.820 --> 49:39.660
 into Europe 43,000 years ago.

49:39.660 --> 49:42.180
 And people are much more inclined to say,

49:42.180 --> 49:45.100
 well, the Neanderthals were at low population density,

49:45.100 --> 49:51.500
 so they just couldn't survive the demographic sweep.

49:51.500 --> 49:55.540
 Or the disease came in, and maybe those things

49:55.540 --> 49:56.500
 might have been important.

49:56.500 --> 49:59.940
 But far and away, the most obvious possibility

49:59.940 --> 50:07.740
 is that sapiens were just powerful.

50:07.740 --> 50:10.300
 Everyone agrees they had larger groups.

50:10.300 --> 50:12.460
 They had better weapons.

50:12.460 --> 50:15.780
 They had projectile weapons, bows and arrows

50:15.780 --> 50:21.940
 to judge from the little microlyth, bits of flake,

50:21.940 --> 50:25.100
 which the Neanderthals didn't.

50:25.100 --> 50:28.940
 Nowadays, there's evidence of interbreeding,

50:28.940 --> 50:33.060
 quite extensive interbreeding between sapiens and Neanderthals,

50:33.060 --> 50:35.100
 as well as with some other groups.

50:35.100 --> 50:38.460
 And sometimes people say, well, so they loved each other.

50:38.460 --> 50:40.380
 They made love not war.

50:40.380 --> 50:42.740
 I think they made love and war.

50:42.740 --> 50:46.500
 And it wouldn't necessarily mean too loving.

50:46.500 --> 50:49.220
 I mean, if you just follow through

50:49.220 --> 50:51.660
 from typical ethnographies nowadays

50:51.660 --> 50:55.380
 of when dominant groups meet subordinate groups,

50:55.380 --> 50:57.980
 they didn't know each other, then

50:57.980 --> 51:00.980
 you can imagine that Neanderthal females would essentially

51:00.980 --> 51:07.100
 be captured and taken into sapiens groups.

51:07.100 --> 51:12.380
 Maybe you can comment on this cautiously

51:12.380 --> 51:16.340
 and eloquently, what's the role of sexual violence

51:16.340 --> 51:18.140
 in human evolution?

51:18.140 --> 51:21.460
 Because you mentioned taking Neanderthal females.

51:21.460 --> 51:23.900
 You've also mentioned that some of these rules

51:23.900 --> 51:28.780
 are defined by the male side of the society.

51:28.780 --> 51:33.060
 What's the role of sexual violence in this story?

51:33.060 --> 51:34.820
 I think you've got to distinguish between groups

51:34.820 --> 51:35.620
 and within groups.

51:35.620 --> 51:43.220
 And I think the world has been slowly waking up

51:43.220 --> 51:46.540
 over the last several decades to the fact

51:46.540 --> 51:52.660
 that sexual violence is routine in war.

51:52.660 --> 51:59.060
 And that to me says that it's just another example of power

51:59.060 --> 52:09.300
 corrupts because when frustrated, scared, elated soldiers

52:09.300 --> 52:13.780
 come upon females in a group that there's

52:13.780 --> 52:19.340
 been essential dehumanization of, then they get carried away

52:19.340 --> 52:21.860
 by opportunity.

52:21.860 --> 52:25.140
 It is not always possible to argue

52:25.140 --> 52:30.540
 that this is adaptive nowadays because you get lots and lots

52:30.540 --> 52:38.780
 of stories of women being abused to the point of being killed.

52:38.780 --> 52:41.260
 She'll be gang raped and then killed.

52:41.260 --> 52:46.180
 There's lots of terrible cases of that reported

52:46.180 --> 52:49.620
 from all sorts of different wars.

52:49.620 --> 52:54.900
 But you can see that that could build on a pattern

52:54.900 --> 52:59.860
 that would have been adaptive if happening under much less

52:59.860 --> 53:02.940
 extreme circumstances.

53:02.940 --> 53:05.860
 The war is very extreme nowadays in the sense

53:05.860 --> 53:10.220
 that you get battles in which people are sent by a military

53:10.220 --> 53:13.500
 hierarchy into a war situation in which they do not

53:13.500 --> 53:15.820
 feel what hunters and gatherers would typically

53:15.820 --> 53:18.660
 have felt, which would have been that if we attack,

53:18.660 --> 53:21.980
 we have an excellent chance of getting away with it.

53:21.980 --> 53:25.860
 Nowadays, you're sent in across the Somme or whatever it is

53:25.860 --> 53:28.700
 and there's a very high chance you will be killed.

53:28.700 --> 53:32.060
 And that's totally unnatural and a novel evolutionary

53:32.060 --> 53:34.820
 experience, I think.

53:34.820 --> 53:37.540
 Then there's sexual coercion within groups.

53:37.540 --> 53:43.300
 And so that takes various kinds of forms.

53:43.300 --> 53:45.700
 But nowadays, of course, I think people

53:45.700 --> 53:49.660
 recognize increasingly that the principal form

53:49.660 --> 53:58.420
 of sexual intimidation and rape occurs within relationships.

53:58.420 --> 54:03.420
 It's not stranger rape that is really statistically important.

54:03.420 --> 54:12.020
 There's much more what happens behind the walls of a bedroom

54:12.020 --> 54:14.900
 where people have been living for some time.

54:14.900 --> 54:20.980
 And just two thoughts and observations about this.

54:20.980 --> 54:32.380
 One is that it may seem odd that males should

54:32.380 --> 54:37.260
 think it a good idea, as it were, to impose themselves

54:37.260 --> 54:41.460
 sexually on someone with whom they have a relationship.

54:41.460 --> 54:45.940
 But what they're doing is intimidating someone

54:45.940 --> 54:50.500
 in a relationship in which the relative power in the relationship

54:50.500 --> 54:54.260
 has continuing significance for a long time.

54:54.260 --> 54:59.100
 And that power probably goes well beyond just the sexual.

54:59.100 --> 55:01.900
 It's to do with domestic relationships.

55:01.900 --> 55:06.180
 It's to do with the man getting his own way all the way.

55:06.180 --> 55:09.820
 It's power dynamics and the sexual aggression

55:09.820 --> 55:13.220
 as one of the tools to regain power, gain power,

55:13.220 --> 55:14.900
 gain more power, and that kind of thing.

55:14.900 --> 55:16.700
 Yeah, exactly.

55:16.700 --> 55:21.340
 And in that respect, it's worth noting

55:21.340 --> 55:25.700
 that although this wasn't appreciated for some time,

55:25.700 --> 55:28.340
 it's emerging that in a bunch of primates,

55:28.340 --> 55:35.020
 you have somewhat parallel kinds of sexual intimidation,

55:35.020 --> 55:37.820
 where males will target particular females,

55:37.820 --> 55:41.300
 even in a group in which the norm is for females

55:41.300 --> 55:43.460
 to mate with multiple males.

55:43.460 --> 55:45.940
 But each male will target a particular female,

55:45.940 --> 55:49.540
 and the more he is aggressive towards her,

55:49.540 --> 55:55.220
 then the more she conforms to his wishes when he wants to mate.

55:55.220 --> 55:58.860
 So a long term pattern of sexual intimidation.

55:58.860 --> 56:00.340
 So there's that aspect.

56:00.340 --> 56:02.100
 The other aspect I would just note

56:02.100 --> 56:09.140
 is that males get away with a lot compared

56:09.140 --> 56:13.420
 to females in any kind of intersexual conflict.

56:16.060 --> 56:19.860
 So the punishment, here's one example of this.

56:19.860 --> 56:23.420
 The punishment for a husband killing a wife

56:23.420 --> 56:25.540
 has always been much less than the punishment

56:25.540 --> 56:26.900
 for a wife killing a husband.

56:26.900 --> 56:32.140
 And you see similar sorts of things

56:32.140 --> 56:36.940
 in terms of the punishments for adultery and so on.

56:36.940 --> 56:44.540
 I bring this up in the context of males sexually intimidating

56:44.540 --> 56:48.940
 their partners, be it wives or whoever,

56:48.940 --> 56:55.500
 because it's a reminder that it's basically a patriarchal world

56:55.500 --> 56:59.980
 that we have come from, a patriarchal world in which

56:59.980 --> 57:05.620
 male alliances tend to support males and take advantage

57:05.620 --> 57:07.660
 of the fact that they have political power

57:07.660 --> 57:09.660
 at the expense of females.

57:09.660 --> 57:11.900
 And I would say that that all goes back

57:11.900 --> 57:14.700
 to what happened 300,000 to 400,000 years ago

57:14.700 --> 57:16.580
 when the beta males took charge

57:16.580 --> 57:19.060
 and they started imposing their own norms

57:19.060 --> 57:22.460
 on society as a whole, and they've continued to do so.

57:22.460 --> 57:24.740
 And we now look at ourselves and, you know,

57:24.740 --> 57:28.700
 Jordan Peterson says, we are not a patriarchal society.

57:28.700 --> 57:32.380
 Well, you know, it's true that the laws try and make it even

57:32.380 --> 57:35.340
 handed nowadays between males and females.

57:35.340 --> 57:38.780
 But obviously, we are patriarchal de facto,

57:38.780 --> 57:45.300
 because society still in many ways supports men

57:45.300 --> 57:47.980
 better than it supports women in these sorts of conflicts.

57:47.980 --> 57:52.220
 So beta male patriarchal, if we're

57:52.220 --> 57:55.260
 looking at the evolutionary history,

57:55.260 --> 57:58.820
 OK, is there maybe sticking on Jordan for a second,

57:58.820 --> 58:04.380
 is there, so he's a psychologist, right?

58:04.380 --> 58:08.940
 And what part of the picture do you

58:08.940 --> 58:16.340
 think he's missing in analyzing the human relations?

58:16.340 --> 58:20.100
 What needs, what does he need to understand

58:20.100 --> 58:23.020
 about our origins in violence and the way

58:23.020 --> 58:24.900
 that society has been constructed?

58:24.900 --> 58:30.100
 Oh, I don't want to go deep into his missing perspectives,

58:30.100 --> 58:33.860
 you know, but I just think that what he's

58:33.860 --> 58:37.780
 doing in that particular example is focusing

58:37.780 --> 58:41.020
 on the legalistic position.

58:41.020 --> 58:44.180
 And that's great that, you know, you

58:44.180 --> 58:48.580
 do not find formal patriarchy in the law anything

58:48.580 --> 58:53.100
 like to the extent that you could find it 100 years ago

58:53.100 --> 58:53.620
 and so on.

58:53.620 --> 58:56.020
 You know, women have got the vote now, hooray.

58:56.020 --> 58:58.620
 But it took a long time for women to get the vote.

58:58.620 --> 59:08.020
 And it remains the case that women suffer in various kinds

59:08.020 --> 59:13.700
 of ways, you know, I mean, a woman who is,

59:13.700 --> 59:17.900
 has lots of sexual partners, is treated much more rudely

59:17.900 --> 59:21.260
 than a male who has lots of sexual partners.

59:21.260 --> 59:23.100
 There are all sorts of informal ways

59:23.100 --> 59:27.180
 in which it's rougher being a woman than it does a man.

59:27.180 --> 59:32.580
 And if we look at the surface layer of the law,

59:32.580 --> 59:38.020
 we may miss the deeper human nature,

59:38.020 --> 59:41.180
 like the origins of our human nature that still operates

59:41.180 --> 59:42.620
 no matter what the law says.

59:42.620 --> 59:47.100
 Yeah, which is, you know, human nature is awkward

59:47.100 --> 59:50.940
 because it includes some unpleasant features

59:50.940 --> 59:54.140
 that when we sit back and reflect about them,

59:54.140 --> 59:57.860
 we would like them to go away.

59:57.860 --> 1:00:04.940
 But it remains the fact that men are hugely concerned

1:00:04.940 --> 1:00:11.820
 to try and have sex with at least one woman

1:00:11.820 --> 1:00:14.020
 and, you know, often lots of women.

1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:15.620
 And so women are, men are constantly

1:00:15.620 --> 1:00:18.500
 putting pressure on women in ways

1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:19.900
 that women find unpleasant.

1:00:19.900 --> 1:00:21.620
 And if men sit back and reflect about it,

1:00:21.620 --> 1:00:22.860
 they think, yeah, we shouldn't do this.

1:00:22.860 --> 1:00:26.260
 But actually, it just goes on because of human nature.

1:00:26.260 --> 1:00:30.860
 So maybe looking at particular humans in history,

1:00:30.860 --> 1:00:32.860
 let's talk about Genghis Khan.

1:00:32.860 --> 1:00:37.180
 So is this particular human who was one

1:00:37.180 --> 1:00:42.260
 of the most famous examples of large scale violence,

1:00:42.260 --> 1:00:45.780
 is he a deep representative of human nature

1:00:45.780 --> 1:00:47.940
 or is he a rare exception?

1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:53.500
 Well, I think that it's easy to imagine

1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:59.460
 that most men could have become Genghis Khan.

1:00:59.460 --> 1:01:03.140
 It's possible that he had a particular streak of psychopathy.

1:01:03.140 --> 1:01:10.780
 You know, it's striking that by the time

1:01:10.780 --> 1:01:18.420
 you become immensely powerful, then you're a willingness

1:01:18.420 --> 1:01:22.460
 to do terrible things for the interest

1:01:22.460 --> 1:01:28.300
 of yourself and your group becomes very high.

1:01:28.300 --> 1:01:36.980
 You know, Stalin, Mao Zedong, these sorts of people

1:01:36.980 --> 1:01:42.220
 have histories in which they do not show obvious psychopathy.

1:01:42.220 --> 1:01:44.140
 But by the time they are big leaders,

1:01:44.140 --> 1:01:46.100
 they are really psychopathic in the sense

1:01:46.100 --> 1:01:50.500
 that they do not follow the ordinary morality

1:01:50.500 --> 1:01:56.380
 of considering the harm that they are doing to their victims.

1:01:56.380 --> 1:02:03.340
 What kind of experiment would we need to discover

1:02:03.340 --> 1:02:06.660
 whether or not anybody could fall into this position?

1:02:06.660 --> 1:02:11.740
 I don't know, but Lord Acton's famous dictum

1:02:11.740 --> 1:02:15.380
 was power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts,

1:02:15.380 --> 1:02:16.700
 absolutely.

1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:19.060
 And then the point that people often forget

1:02:19.060 --> 1:02:20.540
 is the next sentence that he said,

1:02:20.540 --> 1:02:24.740
 which is, great men are almost always bad men.

1:02:24.740 --> 1:02:26.380
 And that is right.

1:02:26.380 --> 1:02:29.860
 It is very difficult to find a great man in history

1:02:29.860 --> 1:02:34.020
 who is not responsible for terrible things.

1:02:34.020 --> 1:02:38.860
 I think there is some aspect of it that it's not just power.

1:02:38.860 --> 1:02:43.260
 I think men who have been the most destructive

1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:50.180
 in human history are not psychopathic completely.

1:02:50.180 --> 1:02:52.940
 They have convinced themselves of an idea.

1:02:52.940 --> 1:02:55.500
 It's like the idea of psychopathic.

1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:58.180
 Stalin, for example, Hitler is a complicated one.

1:02:58.180 --> 1:03:00.420
 I think he was legitimately insane.

1:03:00.420 --> 1:03:02.980
 But I think Stalin has convinced himself

1:03:02.980 --> 1:03:05.940
 that he's doing good.

1:03:05.940 --> 1:03:08.180
 So the idea of communism is the thing

1:03:08.180 --> 1:03:10.140
 that's psychopathic in his mind.

1:03:10.140 --> 1:03:12.860
 Like a bread, you construct a worldview

1:03:12.860 --> 1:03:15.620
 in which the violence is justified,

1:03:15.620 --> 1:03:17.500
 the cruelty is justified.

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:21.420
 So in that sense, first of all, you

1:03:21.420 --> 1:03:24.380
 can construct experiments, unethical experiments

1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:25.100
 that could test this.

1:03:25.100 --> 1:03:28.980
 But in that sense, anybody else could have been

1:03:28.980 --> 1:03:30.820
 in Stalin's position.

1:03:30.820 --> 1:03:33.460
 It's the idea that could overtake

1:03:33.460 --> 1:03:35.900
 the mind of a human being.

1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:38.420
 And in so doing, justify cruel acts.

1:03:38.420 --> 1:03:42.100
 And that seems to be, at least in part, unique to humans.

1:03:42.100 --> 1:03:45.540
 It's the ability to hold ideas in our minds

1:03:45.540 --> 1:03:49.380
 and share those ideas and use those ideas

1:03:49.380 --> 1:03:53.740
 to convince ourselves that proactive violence

1:03:53.740 --> 1:03:57.420
 on a large scale is a good idea.

1:03:57.420 --> 1:03:59.100
 So that, I don't know if you have a comment.

1:03:59.100 --> 1:03:59.860
 I suppose so.

1:03:59.860 --> 1:04:04.580
 But it seems to me what really motivated Stalin

1:04:04.580 --> 1:04:12.740
 was not so much communism as the retention of power.

1:04:12.740 --> 1:04:17.900
 So once he became leader, and in the process of becoming

1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:20.900
 leader, he was absolutely desperate

1:04:20.900 --> 1:04:24.140
 to get rid of anybody who was a challenger.

1:04:24.140 --> 1:04:28.420
 He was deeply suspicious, suspicious of anybody,

1:04:28.420 --> 1:04:32.140
 even on his side, who might possibly

1:04:32.140 --> 1:04:36.020
 be showing a glimmerings of willingness to challenge him.

1:04:36.020 --> 1:04:42.940
 So when he apparently had Kirov murdered,

1:04:42.940 --> 1:04:45.340
 Kirov was a great communist.

1:04:45.340 --> 1:04:47.780
 Trotsky was a great communist.

1:04:47.780 --> 1:04:52.340
 All his rivals, and when he went into the towns

1:04:52.340 --> 1:04:55.220
 and murdered people by the tens of thousands.

1:04:55.220 --> 1:04:56.220
 They were all communists.

1:04:56.220 --> 1:04:58.700
 A lot of them were explicit communists.

1:04:58.700 --> 1:05:00.100
 That's right.

1:05:00.100 --> 1:05:05.020
 But what he was worried about was that they were rivals to him.

1:05:05.020 --> 1:05:08.860
 I suppose the thought is, I am the best person

1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:14.980
 to bring about a global embrace of communism.

1:05:14.980 --> 1:05:17.620
 And others are not.

1:05:17.620 --> 1:05:19.660
 And so we have to get rid of those others.

1:05:19.660 --> 1:05:21.660
 Well, I suspect you're being very charitable here.

1:05:21.660 --> 1:05:26.580
 But maybe you know enough about Stalin to really.

1:05:26.580 --> 1:05:27.300
 Yes.

1:05:27.300 --> 1:05:30.900
 Also, the point I'm making, I do quite a bit,

1:05:30.900 --> 1:05:34.740
 is from my understanding and sense, of course,

1:05:34.740 --> 1:05:38.660
 we can't know for sure, is he believed in communism.

1:05:38.660 --> 1:05:42.740
 This wasn't purely a game of power.

1:05:42.740 --> 1:05:46.260
 Now, he got drunk with power pretty quickly.

1:05:46.260 --> 1:05:50.620
 But he really believed for, I believe his whole life,

1:05:50.620 --> 1:05:54.060
 that communism is good for the world.

1:05:54.060 --> 1:05:59.340
 And that I don't know what role that belief plays

1:05:59.340 --> 1:06:03.780
 with the more natural human desire for power.

1:06:03.780 --> 1:06:06.140
 I don't know, but it just seems like.

1:06:06.140 --> 1:06:12.580
 As we agreed, he's killing a lot of communists on his journey.

1:06:12.580 --> 1:06:15.540
 But it's not that doesn't, that calculus doesn't work that way.

1:06:15.540 --> 1:06:18.380
 There's humans who are communists.

1:06:18.380 --> 1:06:20.860
 And then there's the idea of communism.

1:06:20.860 --> 1:06:25.700
 So for him, in his delusional worldview,

1:06:25.700 --> 1:06:30.260
 killing a few people is worth the final result

1:06:30.260 --> 1:06:32.700
 of bringing communism to the whole world.

1:06:32.700 --> 1:06:34.340
 But it was more than that again, because I mean,

1:06:34.340 --> 1:06:37.580
 he really wanted power for the Soviet Union.

1:06:37.580 --> 1:06:48.260
 And so surely the reason that he orchestrated the export of wheat

1:06:48.260 --> 1:06:53.820
 from Ukraine and in so doing was willing to lead to mass starvation

1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:55.940
 was because he wanted to sell it on the market

1:06:55.940 --> 1:07:00.820
 in order to be able to build up the power of the Soviet Union.

1:07:00.820 --> 1:07:03.500
 You know, alternative view of communism might have been,

1:07:03.500 --> 1:07:07.820
 well, you know, let's just make sure everybody survives and make sure

1:07:07.820 --> 1:07:11.900
 everybody has enough to eat and we'll all be mutually supportive

1:07:11.900 --> 1:07:13.540
 in a communal network.

1:07:13.540 --> 1:07:16.060
 But no, but he wanted the power for the country.

1:07:16.060 --> 1:07:17.260
 Well, I guess exactly.

1:07:17.260 --> 1:07:19.260
 So that it's not even communism.

1:07:19.260 --> 1:07:21.700
 The set of ideas are like Marxism or something like that.

1:07:21.700 --> 1:07:22.980
 It's the country.

1:07:22.980 --> 1:07:29.700
 I guess what I'm saying is it's not purely power for the individual.

1:07:29.700 --> 1:07:33.340
 It's power for a vision for this great nation.

1:07:33.340 --> 1:07:37.300
 The Soviet Union and similar with Hitler,

1:07:37.300 --> 1:07:42.220
 the guy believed that this is a great nation, Germany.

1:07:42.220 --> 1:07:47.380
 And like they, it's a nation that's been wronged throughout history

1:07:47.380 --> 1:07:49.860
 and needs to be righted.

1:07:49.860 --> 1:07:55.460
 And there's some dance between the individual human and the tribe.

1:07:55.460 --> 1:07:56.940
 Yes, no, absolutely.

1:07:56.940 --> 1:08:02.100
 Yes. And so just like chimpanzees, you know, we are fiercely tribal

1:08:02.100 --> 1:08:06.860
 and the tribalism resides particularly in male psychology.

1:08:06.860 --> 1:08:14.500
 And it's very scary because once you assemble a set of males

1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:22.140
 who share tribal identity, then they have power that they can exert

1:08:22.140 --> 1:08:29.060
 with very little concern about what they're doing to damage other people.

1:08:29.060 --> 1:08:33.860
 Do you think this, so Nietzschean will to power?

1:08:33.860 --> 1:08:36.060
 We talked about the corrupting nature of power.

1:08:36.060 --> 1:08:42.860
 Do you think that's a manifestation of those early origins of violence?

1:08:42.860 --> 1:08:50.060
 What's the connection of this desire for power and our proclivity for violence?

1:08:50.060 --> 1:08:54.420
 You know, what we're talking about is tribal power, right?

1:08:54.420 --> 1:08:56.860
 Power on behalf of a group.

1:08:56.860 --> 1:08:57.620
 Yes.

1:08:57.620 --> 1:09:04.460
 And yeah, that seems to me to go right back to a deep evolutionary origin

1:09:04.460 --> 1:09:10.420
 because you see essentially the same thing in a whole bunch of animals.

1:09:10.420 --> 1:09:16.660
 You know, that most of the sort of cognitively complex animals

1:09:16.660 --> 1:09:21.900
 live in social groups in which they have tribal boundaries.

1:09:21.900 --> 1:09:28.740
 And so what you see in chimpanzees is echoed in almost all of the primates.

1:09:28.740 --> 1:09:34.460
 The difference between us and chimpanzees and humans on the one hand

1:09:34.460 --> 1:09:39.220
 and other primates on the other is that we kill and they don't.

1:09:39.220 --> 1:09:43.700
 And the reason they don't is because they never meet in the context

1:09:43.700 --> 1:09:46.820
 where there are massive imbalances of power.

1:09:46.820 --> 1:09:52.540
 So two groups of baboons, you know, the study on this side and 50 on this side, fine.

1:09:52.540 --> 1:09:59.500
 Nobody's going to try and kill anybody else because the serious risks involved.

1:09:59.500 --> 1:10:02.140
 But nevertheless, they are tribal.

1:10:02.140 --> 1:10:08.100
 So, you know, they will have fairly intense intergroup interactions

1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:12.500
 in which everybody knows whose side is on, who is on whose side.

1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:21.020
 And the long term consequences of winning those battles, nonlethal battles,

1:10:21.020 --> 1:10:27.180
 is that the dominance get access to larger areas of land,

1:10:27.180 --> 1:10:40.140
 more safety and so on, with chances are better record of reproductive success subsequently.

1:10:40.140 --> 1:10:44.180
 Do you think this, from an evolutionary perspective, is a feature or a bug,

1:10:44.180 --> 1:10:50.700
 our natural sort of tendency to form tribes?

1:10:50.700 --> 1:10:52.860
 So what's a bug?

1:10:52.860 --> 1:10:57.620
 Oh, sorry, this is a computer programming analogy,

1:10:57.620 --> 1:11:03.180
 meaning like it would be more beneficial.

1:11:03.180 --> 1:11:09.140
 Is it beneficial or detrimental to form tribes from an evolutionary perspective?

1:11:09.140 --> 1:11:13.180
 Yeah, yeah, but what does it mean, what does a bug mean?

1:11:13.180 --> 1:11:15.180
 Yes, right.

1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:17.420
 Well, yeah, like where's evolution going anyway?

1:11:17.420 --> 1:11:22.460
 It's beneficial from, you know, it's beneficial in the sense that it evolved by natural selection

1:11:22.460 --> 1:11:25.380
 to benefit the individuals who did it.

1:11:25.380 --> 1:11:30.180
 But if by bug you mean something that from the point of view of the species,

1:11:30.180 --> 1:11:32.500
 it would be great if you could just wipe this out,

1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:35.980
 because the species would somehow do better as a result.

1:11:35.980 --> 1:11:40.860
 Then yes, but then you know, males are a bug.

1:11:40.860 --> 1:11:48.020
 Come on now, there's some nice things to males, speaking as a male.

1:11:48.020 --> 1:11:51.860
 The fact that there are some nice things to males doesn't mean that they're not bugs.

1:11:51.860 --> 1:11:56.300
 You know, maybe they're quite nice bugs, but it would be much better for the species as a whole

1:11:56.300 --> 1:12:02.940
 not to have to have males who impose this violence on the species as a whole.

1:12:02.940 --> 1:12:07.060
 As somebody who practiced controlled violence and doing a lot of martial arts,

1:12:07.060 --> 1:12:09.900
 yeah, it, I'm not sure.

1:12:09.900 --> 1:12:15.180
 It does seem kind of fun to have this kind of controlled violence, also sports.

1:12:15.180 --> 1:12:20.460
 Also, I mean, the question of conflict in general, I guess that's the deeper question.

1:12:20.460 --> 1:12:27.620
 Don't you think there's some value to conflict for the improvement of society for progress,

1:12:27.620 --> 1:12:30.980
 that this tension between tribes?

1:12:30.980 --> 1:12:36.500
 Isn't this like experiment, a continued experiment,

1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:40.140
 we conduct with each other and to figure out what is a better world to build?

1:12:40.140 --> 1:12:47.380
 Like you need that conflict of good ideas and bad ideas to go to war with each other.

1:12:47.380 --> 1:12:53.540
 It's like the United States with the 50 states and the, it's the laboratory of ideas.

1:12:53.540 --> 1:12:59.300
 Don't you think that is, again, feature versus bug?

1:12:59.300 --> 1:13:02.860
 This kind of conflict, when it doesn't get out of hand,

1:13:02.860 --> 1:13:07.940
 is actually ultimately progressive, productive for a better world.

1:13:07.940 --> 1:13:09.940
 Well, what do you mean by conflict?

1:13:09.940 --> 1:13:16.380
 I mean, you can have conflict in the sense of people have different ideas about the solution to a problem.

1:13:16.380 --> 1:13:23.340
 And so their ideas are in conflict, they can sit down with it and on a log and chat about it

1:13:23.340 --> 1:13:28.900
 and then decide, okay, you're right or I'm wrong or whatever.

1:13:28.900 --> 1:13:37.820
 But if my conflict, you mean a great idea to build a nuclear bomb and set that off, then no,

1:13:37.820 --> 1:13:43.420
 I don't see why it's a good idea to have all this violence.

1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:46.820
 Yeah, there's...

1:13:46.820 --> 1:13:54.980
 I wonder, it's not a good idea, but I wonder if human history would evolve the way it did without the violence.

1:13:54.980 --> 1:14:00.620
 Oh, I'm sure you're right, probably humans were not evolved in the sense that we have.

1:14:00.620 --> 1:14:10.900
 But I would hope that the course of violence in evolution will continue in the way it has.

1:14:10.900 --> 1:14:21.780
 So there's all sorts of indications that the importance of violence has been reduced over time.

1:14:21.780 --> 1:14:28.940
 And this is made famous in Stephen Pinker's book, but others have written about it too.

1:14:28.940 --> 1:14:38.340
 That the frequency of death from violence in every country you look at has been declining.

1:14:38.340 --> 1:14:39.140
 That's just great.

1:14:39.140 --> 1:14:45.940
 And so the amazing thing about this is that even when you take the death due to the First World War and the Second World War,

1:14:45.940 --> 1:14:53.980
 the 20th century appears to have been statistically, meaning rates of death per individual,

1:14:53.980 --> 1:14:59.580
 the least violent in history.

1:14:59.580 --> 1:15:05.660
 So we haven't got very far down the course to nonviolence, but I don't see why we shouldn't just carry on doing it.

1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:14.220
 I think it's ridiculous, frankly, excuse my frankness, to say that violence is a good thing.

1:15:14.220 --> 1:15:21.940
 I think that it would be a wonderful concept if we could evolve somehow to a world three thousand years from now

1:15:21.940 --> 1:15:32.460
 where violence is really regarded as simply appalling and that they look back on our time and can't believe what we were doing.

1:15:32.460 --> 1:15:40.220
 Yeah. But of course, violence takes a lot of different shapes as we start to think deeper and deeper about living beings on Earth.

1:15:40.220 --> 1:15:49.340
 For example, the violence we commit and the torture we commit to animals and then perhaps on the line as we talked offline about with robots and that kind of thing.

1:15:49.340 --> 1:15:52.620
 So there's just so many ways to commit violence to others.

1:15:52.620 --> 1:16:06.380
 And some people now talk about violence in the space of ideas, which, of course, to me, at least, is a bit of a silly notion relative to use that same V word for the space of ideas versus actual physical violence.

1:16:06.380 --> 1:16:16.660
 But it may be that long time from now, we see that even violence in the space of ideas is quite a manifestation of that same kind of violence.

1:16:16.660 --> 1:16:20.260
 And so it is interesting where this is headed.

1:16:20.260 --> 1:16:22.940
 And I think you're absolutely right.

1:16:22.940 --> 1:16:27.500
 A world, a nonviolent world does seem like a better world.

1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:36.060
 I wonder if the constraints on resources somehow make that world more and more difficult, especially as we run out of resources.

1:16:36.060 --> 1:16:38.860
 It's got to be very, very different from what we're doing nowadays.

1:16:38.860 --> 1:16:40.860
 And it's unimaginably different.

1:16:40.860 --> 1:16:43.620
 If we could imagine it, then maybe we could work towards it at the moment.

1:16:43.620 --> 1:16:45.420
 Nobody knows how to work towards it.

1:16:45.420 --> 1:16:48.620
 Well, that's kind of the stories of humans is we don't really know the future.

1:16:48.620 --> 1:16:56.980
 We're trying to try to ad hoc, kind of develop it as we go and sometimes get into trouble as to violence.

1:16:56.980 --> 1:17:11.740
 But you know, George Orwell's vision in 1984 was of two or three world powers, each so powerful that nobody could could diminish the could destroy the other.

1:17:11.740 --> 1:17:23.740
 But the notion of an evolutionarily stable relationship among heavily armed world powers just does not seem.

1:17:23.740 --> 1:17:27.260
 So it's reasonable at all.

1:17:27.260 --> 1:17:42.060
 There's to say, you know, we've we've now got 170 or 190 nations in the world dominated by a few big ones, all with arms pointing at each other.

1:17:42.060 --> 1:17:53.540
 And the notion that we could just carry on having peace talks and making sure that these arms don't get involved in some kind of massive conflagration.

1:17:53.540 --> 1:18:04.060
 It seems incredibly optimistic, some kind of major change has to happen, whereby, you know, and some people would like to see all the weapons go.

1:18:04.060 --> 1:18:10.540
 That'd be great. You know, I'm a member of that sort of group that tries to see that happen.

1:18:10.540 --> 1:18:12.980
 It's going to be very difficult to see it happen.

1:18:12.980 --> 1:18:21.740
 Another kind of concept is the nations themselves will dissolve and will become one one government.

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:30.620
 That itself is a terrifying vision because the capacity for abuse by a single world power would be so problematic.

1:18:30.620 --> 1:18:35.100
 And in addition, how do you get there without a war in the first place?

1:18:35.100 --> 1:18:41.940
 So, you know, at the moment, we have no reasonable kind of future in mind, but I'm sure it's there somewhere.

1:18:41.940 --> 1:18:43.460
 It's just that we haven't yet to find it.

1:18:43.460 --> 1:18:49.540
 And a lot of people like in the cryptocurrency space argue that you can create decentralized societies.

1:18:49.540 --> 1:19:03.820
 If you take away the power from states to define the monetary system, so they argue like if you make the monetary system such that is disjoint from the control of any one individual, any one government,

1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:10.700
 then that might be a way to form sort of ad hoc decentralized societies, they just pop up all over the place.

1:19:10.700 --> 1:19:17.860
 That's a really interesting technological solution to how to remove the overreach of power from governments.

1:19:17.860 --> 1:19:19.900
 Yes, right. Absolutely.

1:19:19.900 --> 1:19:28.540
 And it may well be that the future will emerge out of some sort of quite surprising direction like that.

1:19:28.540 --> 1:19:34.300
 Is it nevertheless surprising to you that we have not destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons?

1:19:34.300 --> 1:19:43.140
 So the mutually assured destruction that we've had for many decades from somebody who studies violence, how does that make sense to you?

1:19:43.140 --> 1:19:54.220
 Well, I mean, I'm surprised only in the sense that accidental, the fact that we have not had an accident yet has been quite remarkable.

1:19:54.220 --> 1:20:06.820
 Because all the accounts are that we've come very close to having very serious accidents where people are either side of misread intentions or apparent launches and so on.

1:20:06.820 --> 1:20:25.300
 So yes, I think it is remarkable. There is a nasty generalization that can be made that the longer that powerful states go without having wars, then the worse the war is afterwards.

1:20:25.300 --> 1:20:34.740
 And you can sort of see that that kind of makes sense because basically what's happening with these tribal groups that the nations are at the moment

1:20:34.740 --> 1:20:42.100
 is that after a big war, like the Second World War, they established new kinds of dominance relationships.

1:20:42.100 --> 1:20:58.500
 And then during the periods of peace, what happens is that the de facto dominance relationships change because some nations become poorer, some become richer, some become more militarily powerful and so on.

1:20:58.500 --> 1:21:09.460
 Generally, economy and military goes hand in hand. So right now China emerged from the war as a relatively low status state and is now high status.

1:21:09.460 --> 1:21:25.940
 So if this was chimpanzees, what would happen is that you would predict a conflict because you need to have a readjustment of the formal dominance relationships to recognize the new in practice dominance relationships recognized by the economy and the military.

1:21:25.940 --> 1:21:37.060
 So the longer that you have of a period of peace following a war, then the more these tensions of unresolved changed dominance relationships build up.

1:21:37.060 --> 1:21:46.180
 And the longer they take to occur, then the more challenging are going to be the conflicts.

1:21:46.180 --> 1:21:50.420
 That's a terrifying view because we've been out of conflict for quite a bit.

1:21:50.420 --> 1:21:50.980
 That's right.

1:21:50.980 --> 1:21:52.340
 Maybe it's building up.

1:21:52.340 --> 1:22:10.980
 So it's a scary view. But on the other hand, things have changed hugely with the advent of nuclear weapons because at least that conforms to this psychology that is very clear in other animals, which is you don't want to get into a fight if you are going to get hurt.

1:22:10.980 --> 1:22:26.340
 So that's the whole principle of mad mutual assured destruction. And it's doubtless being why powerful nations like America and Russia have not used their nuclear weapons since 1945.

1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:42.420
 So if we can overcome the problem of accidental launches, then maybe the fact of mad does fit into human psychology in a way that means that we really will resolve our tensions without using them.

1:22:42.420 --> 1:23:08.020
 But we haven't yet really faced that challenge. I mean, the Soviet Union collapsed because of the poor economy, but with China desperate to take back Taiwan and America shifting its focus on the Pacific, the potential for something going wrong is clearly very high.

1:23:08.020 --> 1:23:19.700
 So what's the hopeful case that you can make for a long term surviving and thriving human civilization given all the dangers that we face?

1:23:19.700 --> 1:23:29.940
 Well, I can't really exactly make one. I would just say that we're talking about the dangers. Obviously, the dangers are there.

1:23:29.940 --> 1:23:57.700
 But what I would think about is the notion that surprises come from all sorts of different directions. And I mean, you work in robotics and I can well imagine that there will be advances in robotics that in some way I can't even conceive will somehow undermine the motivation for conflict.

1:23:57.700 --> 1:24:15.380
 Something about, you know, by the time chips have been planted in human brains and we're all instantly sharing information in a way that we never did before, will this change the nature of human existence in such a way that these conflicts get resolved?

1:24:15.380 --> 1:24:30.740
 You can remove the conflicts, but keep some of the magic, the beauty of what it means to be human. So like still be able to enjoy life, the richness of life, the full complexity of life, because you can remove conflict by giving everybody a pill and then they go to sleep, right?

1:24:30.740 --> 1:24:40.180
 You still want life to be amazing, exciting, you know, interesting. And so that's where you have to find the balance.

1:24:40.180 --> 1:24:57.860
 Yes, I mean, it's all science fiction stuff. And so how it's going to work out totally unclear. I don't see any worry about the magic of life disappearing. I mean, first of all, you somehow get rid of males.

1:24:57.860 --> 1:25:10.900
 I think you really need to get rid of males, because males are the source of a major problem, which is the lust for power and the resulting conflict.

1:25:10.900 --> 1:25:14.980
 But you don't think the males are also a source of beauty and creation?

1:25:14.980 --> 1:25:31.700
 No, I mean, I don't have anything against males as, you know, as individuals and that sort of thing. And males have clearly done a lot. I mean, they've been incredibly exploratory and creative. And what they've done in art and music has been wonderful and that sort of thing.

1:25:31.700 --> 1:25:40.980
 On the other hand, I'm not sure there's anything particularly special. And I think that probably females could do the same thing just as well when given the chance.

1:25:40.980 --> 1:26:01.460
 Yes, including the dark stuff. I mean, a part of me is not understanding the, so there is evolutionary distinction between men and women. But I tend to believe both men and women, if you look out into the future, can be destructive, can be evil, can be greedy, can be corrupted by power.

1:26:01.460 --> 1:26:19.460
 So if you move males from the picture, which are historically connected to this evolution that we've been talking about, that women are going to fill that role quite nicely. And then it'll be just the same kind of process, not the same, but it'll be new and interesting.

1:26:19.460 --> 1:26:48.460
 There's a sense that the will to power, craving power, committing violence is somehow coupled with all the things that are beautiful about life. That if you remove conflict completely, if you remove all the evil in the world, it seems like you're not going to have a stable place for the beauty, for the goodness.

1:26:48.460 --> 1:27:09.460
 Like, there's always has to be a dragon to fight for the way, if you look at human history, now you can say, the reason I'm nervous about a sort of utopia where everything is great is every time you look through human history when utopia has been chased, you run into a lot of trouble, where again,

1:27:09.460 --> 1:27:25.460
 it sneaks into this evil, this craving for power. Now you can say that's a male problem, but I just think it's a human problem, and it's not even a human problem, it's a chimp problem too. It's life on earth problem, intelligent life on earth problem.

1:27:25.460 --> 1:27:49.460
 So like, it's better to not necessarily get rid of the sources of the darker sides of human nature, but more create mechanisms that the kindness, the goodness paradox, your book, that that is incentivized and encouraged, empowered.

1:27:49.460 --> 1:27:55.460
 Well, look, I don't think it would be utopia if you got rid of the males.

1:27:55.460 --> 1:27:57.460
 Right.

1:27:57.460 --> 1:28:08.460
 And certainly females capable of conflict. I just think it's a gamble worth taking if you could actually do it. You can certainly find females in history who done unpleasant things.

1:28:08.460 --> 1:28:21.460
 But nevertheless, you know, we have a very strong evolutionary theory which explains why males benefit more by having conflict and winning conflicts than females do.

1:28:21.460 --> 1:28:33.460
 And so if we want to talk about reducing conflict, then it would reduce it to get rid of males. Now I understand this is a fantasy.

1:28:33.460 --> 1:28:49.460
 And I think it's a fantasy that people would be able to talk about fairly soon because reproductive technology is getting to the point where it's quite likely that human females could breed without the use of males.

1:28:49.460 --> 1:29:01.460
 And so there would be a sort of potential dynamic if everybody just agreed not to have any male babies.

1:29:01.460 --> 1:29:03.460
 It's a really interesting thought experiment.

1:29:03.460 --> 1:29:13.460
 I will agree with you that if given two buttons, one is get rid of all women and the other buttons get rid of all men,

1:29:13.460 --> 1:29:20.460
 realizing that I have a stake in this choice, you're probably getting rid of all men.

1:29:20.460 --> 1:29:30.460
 If I wanted to preserve Earth and the richness of life on Earth, I would probably get rid of all men.

1:29:30.460 --> 1:29:35.460
 I don't think you have a stake in it. You're saying that because you're a man.

1:29:35.460 --> 1:29:43.460
 But I don't see why being a man should make you any more interested in having a male future for the world than a female future.

1:29:43.460 --> 1:29:47.460
 You've got just as many ancestors who were male as were female.

1:29:47.460 --> 1:29:50.460
 Well, my problem is I'll have to die.

1:29:50.460 --> 1:30:02.460
 Well, that's going to happen anyway. I prefer to die tomorrow not today. I prefer to hit the snooze button on the whole mortality thing.

1:30:02.460 --> 1:30:08.460
 But this is not suggesting that males have to die in order to make room for females.

1:30:08.460 --> 1:30:13.460
 All you have to do is just say, don't have any more males born.

1:30:13.460 --> 1:30:14.460
 Interesting.

1:30:14.460 --> 1:30:21.460
 Of course, the difficulty is that because we're tribal, some country somewhere would say, well, we're not going to do that.

1:30:21.460 --> 1:30:24.460
 And then guess what? They'd take over because they're male.

1:30:24.460 --> 1:30:28.460
 So that's why it's impossible to imagine it actually happening.

1:30:28.460 --> 1:30:34.460
 You know what? I'm going to take that and actually think about it. I don't know. I'm uncomfortable.

1:30:34.460 --> 1:30:44.460
 There's a certain kind of woke culture that I've been kind of uncomfortable with because it's not women necessarily.

1:30:44.460 --> 1:30:47.460
 There's a lot of bullying I see.

1:30:47.460 --> 1:30:53.460
 There's a lack of empathy and a lack of kindness towards others that's created by that culture.

1:30:53.460 --> 1:30:59.460
 But you're speaking about something else. You're speaking about reducing conflict in this world

1:30:59.460 --> 1:31:09.460
 and looking at the basics of our human nature and its origins in the evolution of Homo sapiens

1:31:09.460 --> 1:31:17.460
 and thinking about which kind of aspects of human nature, if we get rid of them, will make for a better world.

1:31:17.460 --> 1:31:19.460
 It's an interesting thought experiment.

1:31:19.460 --> 1:31:24.460
 But it is only a thought experiment. It's got no practical meaning right now.

1:31:24.460 --> 1:31:32.460
 And I take your point that males get a hard rap nowadays in some ways

1:31:32.460 --> 1:31:46.460
 because the balance of social power is moving against, quite rightly in a strong sense,

1:31:46.460 --> 1:31:50.460
 of course, against all the nasty things that males do.

1:31:50.460 --> 1:32:03.460
 But what people sometimes fail to remember is that life is very hard for males who don't have the power,

1:32:03.460 --> 1:32:09.460
 who don't have money, who don't have access to women.

1:32:09.460 --> 1:32:14.460
 You know, I'm sympathetic to in cells.

1:32:14.460 --> 1:32:19.460
 I'm not sympathetic to them using violence to solve their problems.

1:32:19.460 --> 1:32:35.460
 But I am very sympathetic to the fact that it's not easy simply to be told by well off feminist middle class people

1:32:35.460 --> 1:32:40.460
 that you shouldn't behave like this or you shouldn't feel like this because you do.

1:32:40.460 --> 1:32:54.460
 In general, just empathy and kindness, male or female, I believe will be the thing that builds a better world.

1:32:54.460 --> 1:32:58.460
 And that's practiced in different ways from different backgrounds.

1:32:58.460 --> 1:33:06.460
 But ultimately, you should listen to others and empathize with the experience of others and put more love out there in the world.

1:33:06.460 --> 1:33:19.460
 Now, that hopefully is the way to reduce conflict, reduce violence and reduce that whole psychological experience of being powerless in this world,

1:33:19.460 --> 1:33:22.460
 powerless to become the best version of yourself.

1:33:22.460 --> 1:33:27.460
 When no one's going to disagree with all those fine sentiments, right?

1:33:27.460 --> 1:33:34.460
 Yes, but that's an actionable thing is actually practice empathy.

1:33:34.460 --> 1:33:43.460
 Like saying that somebody should be silenced or just like this group is bad and this group is good.

1:33:43.460 --> 1:33:45.460
 I just feel like that's not empathy.

1:33:45.460 --> 1:33:52.460
 Empathy is understanding the experience of others and respecting it.

1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:56.460
 That's what a better world looks like.

1:33:56.460 --> 1:33:59.460
 That's what the reduction of conflict looks like.

1:33:59.460 --> 1:34:08.460
 It's like as opposed to saying my tribe is right, your tribe is wrong, forget the violence and nonviolence part.

1:34:08.460 --> 1:34:13.460
 That's just that act of saying my tribe is right, that tribe is wrong, removing that from the picture.

1:34:13.460 --> 1:34:15.460
 That's the way to make a better world.

1:34:15.460 --> 1:34:19.460
 That's the way to reduce the violence, I think.

1:34:19.460 --> 1:34:23.460
 Not necessarily removing the people who are causing the violence.

1:34:23.460 --> 1:34:25.460
 You have to get to the source of the problem.

1:34:25.460 --> 1:34:37.460
 I don't mean the evolutionary source, but just the mindset that creates the violence is usually just a lack of empathy for others.

1:34:37.460 --> 1:34:45.460
 Yeah, but you can't just teach that because our evolutionary psychology puts us in particular directions.

1:34:45.460 --> 1:34:58.460
 Do you think it's possible to learn through practice to resist the basics of our evolutionary psychology, the basic forces?

1:34:58.460 --> 1:35:05.460
 Yeah, lots and lots of training, lots and lots of education can do it.

1:35:05.460 --> 1:35:18.460
 The famously most peaceful society that anthropologists have recorded involves a tremendous amount of teaching, including some punishment.

1:35:18.460 --> 1:35:21.460
 It's a society in Thailand.

1:35:21.460 --> 1:35:25.460
 You have to beat it out of children to make them nice.

1:35:25.460 --> 1:35:27.460
 This is carrot and steak.

1:35:27.460 --> 1:35:41.460
 The point is that you do not find societies in which people are spontaneously showing the kinds of behaviors that we would all love them to show.

1:35:41.460 --> 1:35:43.460
 It requires work.

1:35:43.460 --> 1:35:44.460
 It requires work.

1:35:44.460 --> 1:35:47.460
 What is your book titled, Goodness Paradox?

1:35:47.460 --> 1:35:49.460
 What are the main ideas in this book?

1:35:49.460 --> 1:35:59.460
 The paradox is the fact that humans show extremes in relationship to both violence and nonviolence.

1:35:59.460 --> 1:36:10.460
 The violence is that we are one of these few animals in which we use coalitionary proactive violence to kill members of our own species.

1:36:10.460 --> 1:36:13.460
 We do it in large numbers, just like a few other species.

1:36:13.460 --> 1:36:23.460
 The nonviolence is where particularly extreme in how repressed we are in terms of reactive violence.

1:36:23.460 --> 1:36:26.460
 I told you the story of how we get there.

1:36:26.460 --> 1:36:34.460
 What's so extraordinary about it is that most animals are either high on both or relatively low on both.

1:36:34.460 --> 1:36:39.460
 So chimpanzees are high on proactive violence and reactive violence.

1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:50.460
 Bonobos are less than chimpanzees on both of those, but still hundreds of times more reactively aggressive than humans are.

1:36:50.460 --> 1:36:58.460
 What we've done is retain proactive violence being high and got reactive violence really being low.

1:36:58.460 --> 1:37:14.460
 And so we have these wonderful societies in which we're also incredibly nice to each other and tolerant and calm and can meet strangers and have no problem about leading to any kind of conflict.

1:37:14.460 --> 1:37:21.460
 At the same time as we are one of the worst killing machine species that's ever existed.

1:37:21.460 --> 1:37:29.460
 So what's so extraordinary about this is that if you look at the political philosophers of the last few hundred years,

1:37:29.460 --> 1:37:35.460
 you've got this fight famously between Thomas Hobbes and Jean Jacques Rousseau,

1:37:35.460 --> 1:37:38.460
 or literally you've got the fight between their followers.

1:37:38.460 --> 1:37:40.460
 So the followers of Hobbes say,

1:37:40.460 --> 1:37:51.460
 well, Hobbes was right because he says that we are naturally violent and you need a Leviathan, a central government or a king to be able to suppress the violence.

1:37:51.460 --> 1:37:55.460
 So we're naturally horrid and we can learn to be good.

1:37:55.460 --> 1:38:08.460
 Whereas Jean Jacques Rousseau is interpreted as saying the opposite, that we are naturally good and it's only when culture intervenes and horrid ideologies come in that we become uncivilized.

1:38:08.460 --> 1:38:16.460
 And so people have had this endless fight between are we naturally corrupt or are we naturally kind.

1:38:16.460 --> 1:38:26.460
 And that has gone on for years and it's only in the last two or three decades that anthropologists like Christopher Bohm and Bruce Naft have said,

1:38:26.460 --> 1:38:30.460
 look, you know, it's obvious what the answer is we are both of these things.

1:38:30.460 --> 1:38:34.460
 And what is so exciting now is I think we can understand why we are both.

1:38:34.460 --> 1:38:46.460
 And the answer is we come from ancestors that were elevated on proactive aggression that were hunters and killers, both of animals and of each other.

1:38:46.460 --> 1:38:52.460
 And you've got to include that as almost certain from the past.

1:38:52.460 --> 1:39:02.460
 And then now we've taken our reactive aggression and we've downregulated it and that's given us power.

1:39:02.460 --> 1:39:16.460
 It's given us power because once you get rid of the alpha male, once the beta males take over and force selection in favor of a more tolerant, less reactively aggressive individual,

1:39:16.460 --> 1:39:24.460
 the effect is that our cultures suddenly become capable of focusing on things other than conflict.

1:39:24.460 --> 1:39:33.460
 And so we have social groups in which individuals instead of constantly being on edge in the way that chimpanzees are with each other,

1:39:33.460 --> 1:39:46.460
 are able to interact in ways that enable them to share looking at a tool together or share their food together or pass ideas from one to the other,

1:39:46.460 --> 1:39:55.460
 or support each other when they're ill or whatever the issue is, cooperate in ways that make the group far more effective.

1:39:55.460 --> 1:40:06.460
 So you asked earlier, you know, what did I think about why sapiens were able to expand at the expense of Neanderthals so dramatically around 40,000 years ago?

1:40:06.460 --> 1:40:15.460
 And the answer is that whatever it was, it had something to do with the sapiens ability to cooperate.

1:40:15.460 --> 1:40:17.460
 That was what gave them bigger groups.

1:40:17.460 --> 1:40:23.460
 That's what enabled them to have a far more effective way of living.

1:40:23.460 --> 1:40:27.460
 And I suspect it was to do with the weapons and military aspects.

1:40:27.460 --> 1:40:36.460
 But even if it wasn't that, the greater cooperation that sapiens were showing would have been hugely important.

1:40:36.460 --> 1:40:47.460
 So sapiens then had groups of, you know, who knows exactly how big they were, but scores of people to judge from their remains.

1:40:47.460 --> 1:40:57.460
 Whereas Neanderthals were living in widely separated small groups of, you know, maybe as many as 15 or 20 people sometimes,

1:40:57.460 --> 1:41:03.460
 where they saw others so rarely that they were in breeding at high levels.

1:41:03.460 --> 1:41:07.460
 You know, fathers having babies with their daughters.

1:41:07.460 --> 1:41:09.460
 Very different world.

1:41:09.460 --> 1:41:10.460
 Very different world.

1:41:10.460 --> 1:41:13.460
 And that's probably what our world was like before we got sapiens.

1:41:13.460 --> 1:41:14.460
 Before we got sapiens.

1:41:14.460 --> 1:41:19.460
 And it's fascinating that there was that kind of violence against...

1:41:19.460 --> 1:41:30.460
 Once you get rid of the alpha males, you have now the freedom to have kindness amongst the beta males.

1:41:30.460 --> 1:41:34.460
 Like not kindness, but collaboration, that's the better word.

1:41:34.460 --> 1:41:35.460
 Yes.

1:41:35.460 --> 1:41:42.460
 Much more corruption, not just among the males, but among the beta males, but also among the gamma males and the females.

1:41:42.460 --> 1:41:43.460
 Yeah.

1:41:43.460 --> 1:41:47.460
 I don't know what a gamma male is, but I imagine there's a whole alphabet.

1:41:47.460 --> 1:41:54.460
 Well, I don't know about a hell of an alphabet, but I think the big layers are the married men and the unmarried men.

1:41:54.460 --> 1:41:58.460
 Because the married men had a problem with the unmarried men.

1:41:58.460 --> 1:42:02.460
 Right? I mean, you see it in ethnographies of hunters and gatherers recently.

1:42:02.460 --> 1:42:06.460
 Where the unmarried men would be given rules, such as...

1:42:06.460 --> 1:42:13.460
 I mean, a very extreme rule in Northern Australia was you cannot come to the camp for months.

1:42:13.460 --> 1:42:16.460
 You have to go away and live somewhere out in the bush.

1:42:16.460 --> 1:42:17.460
 Yes.

1:42:17.460 --> 1:42:19.460
 Because we don't want you anywhere near our wives.

1:42:19.460 --> 1:42:27.460
 And then another kind of rule is if you are in the camp, you must be in the firelight all the time.

1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:31.460
 Otherwise, we don't know what you're doing out in the dark.

1:42:31.460 --> 1:42:39.460
 You really have us to control them because the men who had lots of wives did not want those horrid bachelors sneaking around the place.

1:42:39.460 --> 1:42:41.460
 I love this.

1:42:41.460 --> 1:42:47.460
 You also wrote the book titled Catching Fire, How Cooking Made Us Human.

1:42:47.460 --> 1:42:50.460
 What's the central idea in this book?

1:42:50.460 --> 1:42:56.460
 There's some title, How Cooking Made Us Human refers not to homo sapiens, but to homo erectus.

1:42:56.460 --> 1:42:59.460
 A human there means the genus homo.

1:42:59.460 --> 1:43:08.460
 And homo erectus is the first full member of the genus homo in the sense that it looked like us,

1:43:08.460 --> 1:43:14.460
 just with a sort of slightly more robust build and a smaller brain.

1:43:14.460 --> 1:43:30.460
 And the central idea of catching fire is that it was the control of fire that was responsible for the emergence of homo erectus and therefore the genus homo,

1:43:30.460 --> 1:43:32.460
 which happened two million years ago.

1:43:32.460 --> 1:43:42.460
 And it was an evolution from a line of Australopithecines.

1:43:42.460 --> 1:43:49.460
 And Australopithecines are the creatures from whom we evolved.

1:43:49.460 --> 1:44:01.460
 They were present in Africa from something like six or seven million years ago up to actually up to one million years ago.

1:44:01.460 --> 1:44:07.460
 And then a branch led off to homo around two million years ago.

1:44:07.460 --> 1:44:13.460
 And the way to think of Australopithecines is that they were like chimpanzees standing upright.

1:44:13.460 --> 1:44:18.460
 So they were erect bipedal walkers.

1:44:18.460 --> 1:44:25.460
 They were like chimpanzees in the sense that they had brains about the size of a chimpanzee.

1:44:25.460 --> 1:44:30.460
 They were literally about the body size of a chimpanzee, a little bit smaller actually.

1:44:30.460 --> 1:44:36.460
 And they had big jaws because they were still eating raw food.

1:44:36.460 --> 1:44:39.460
 They had big teeth and big jaws.

1:44:39.460 --> 1:44:48.460
 And then around two million years ago, the line of Australopithecines, which ended with an intermediate species, a kind of missing link area,

1:44:48.460 --> 1:44:54.460
 because it is not missing, called habilis, sometimes called homo habilis,

1:44:54.460 --> 1:44:58.460
 but more properly, in my view, called Australopithecus habilis.

1:44:58.460 --> 1:45:05.460
 That gave rise to homo erectus and homo erectus, here's how different it was.

1:45:05.460 --> 1:45:18.460
 It had a smaller mouth, a smaller jaw, smaller teeth, and to judge from its ribs and pelvis, smaller gut.

1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:26.460
 In addition, it had lost what Australopithecines all had, which was adaptations for climbing in the trees.

1:45:26.460 --> 1:45:31.460
 And that meant that homo erectus must have slept on the ground.

1:45:31.460 --> 1:45:37.460
 And since it slept on the ground, it should have been able to defend itself somehow against predators.

1:45:37.460 --> 1:45:42.460
 And I can't think of any way they could have done that unless they had fire.

1:45:42.460 --> 1:45:54.460
 So there are two major clues to why it was with homo erectus that our ancestors first acquired the control of fire.

1:45:54.460 --> 1:46:04.460
 One is the fact that they were clearly not sleeping in trees in the way that chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos and all the other primates do.

1:46:04.460 --> 1:46:12.460
 And the other is that there was this striking reduction throughout the gut,

1:46:12.460 --> 1:46:18.460
 reduction in size of the mouth and the chewing apparatus and in the gut itself.

1:46:18.460 --> 1:46:34.460
 And that conforms to what we see nowadays about humans, which is that our guts are about two thirds of the size of what they would be if we at raw food to judge by the great apes.

1:46:34.460 --> 1:46:44.460
 So at some point in our evolution, we acquired the skill of cooking and skill of controlling fire.

1:46:44.460 --> 1:47:03.460
 At no time between two million years ago and the present do we see any changes in our anatomy that can, as it were, justify the enormous change that happens when you are an animal that learns to control fire.

1:47:03.460 --> 1:47:13.460
 But at two million years ago, we have exactly what you'd expect, namely the guts becoming smaller because the food is becoming softer and much more easy to digest.

1:47:13.460 --> 1:47:16.460
 So you don't have to work so hard in your body to digest it.

1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:30.460
 And as I say, a commitment to sleeping on the ground, which I think you'd be absolutely crazy to do nowadays on a moonless night in the middle of Serengeti unless you had fire.

1:47:30.460 --> 1:47:43.460
 I've slept out quite a lot in various parts of Africa in the bush and you will not catch me just lying on the ground in an area with lots of predators unless I got a fire with me.

1:47:43.460 --> 1:47:45.460
 You're going to get eaten.

1:47:45.460 --> 1:47:48.460
 You're going to get terrified and you're going to get eaten.

1:47:48.460 --> 1:48:01.460
 Okay, so there's a million questions I want to ask. So one, is it very naturally coupled the discovery of controlled fire and cooking with fire? Is that an obvious leap?

1:48:01.460 --> 1:48:10.460
 Well, here's what we know. We know that all the animals that we've tested like to eat their food cooked more than they like it raw.

1:48:10.460 --> 1:48:15.460
 So this is true for all the great apes. We've tested them.

1:48:15.460 --> 1:48:17.460
 That's fascinating, by the way.

1:48:17.460 --> 1:48:21.460
 Why is that? That's just like a property of food, I suppose.

1:48:21.460 --> 1:48:31.460
 Yes, I think what it is is that animals are always looking for any kind of way to get food that is easier to digest.

1:48:31.460 --> 1:48:42.460
 And there are various signals in the food, such as the amount of sugar there, the amount of free amino acids, because the amino acids can be tasted.

1:48:42.460 --> 1:48:47.460
 And the physical qualities of the food be particularly important, how tough the food is.

1:48:47.460 --> 1:48:53.460
 Always prefer softer food provided it feels safe, tastes safe.

1:48:53.460 --> 1:49:00.460
 And these kinds of sensory cues are all there in cooked food.

1:49:00.460 --> 1:49:08.460
 It's soft. It doesn't have so many toxins. It's not so noxious to taste, easier to chew.

1:49:08.460 --> 1:49:14.460
 And so everyone loves it spontaneously. Your dogs and your cats prefer cooked food or raw food.

1:49:14.460 --> 1:49:17.460
 Well, maybe you can say that's a consequence of domestication.

1:49:17.460 --> 1:49:25.460
 But even, you know, as I say, all of the great apes, you test naive ones and they prefer it cooked if they can.

1:49:25.460 --> 1:49:32.460
 So then obvious once you have fire, you're going to accidentally discover that food changes when you apply fire to it.

1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:37.460
 And then it's going to be the big crazy new fad.

1:49:37.460 --> 1:49:43.460
 You took the words out of my mouth. I mean, if they have fire at all and, you know, their food rolls into it,

1:49:43.460 --> 1:49:46.460
 five minutes later, it tastes better than before.

1:49:46.460 --> 1:49:52.460
 How big of an invention from an engineering perspective do you think is the discovery of fire?

1:49:52.460 --> 1:50:03.460
 Do you think for the, for Homo erectus, Homo sapiens, do you think it's the greatest invention ever?

1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:17.460
 Yeah, I think that the control of fire has been ultimately responsible for essentially how grandiose do I want to be here.

1:50:17.460 --> 1:50:25.460
 You know, the entire human story going back to Homo is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal.

1:50:25.460 --> 1:50:37.460
 And perhaps the biggest way in which it is likely to have changed us is it reduced the difficulty of making a large brain.

1:50:37.460 --> 1:50:47.460
 So, you know, the story here is that the constraints on brain size are energetic.

1:50:47.460 --> 1:50:56.460
 You and I have brains that are something like 2.5% of our body weight.

1:50:56.460 --> 1:51:03.460
 It consumes around 25% of all of our calories.

1:51:03.460 --> 1:51:05.460
 So it's disproportionate.

1:51:05.460 --> 1:51:11.460
 There are other expensive organs in our body as well, such as the heart.

1:51:11.460 --> 1:51:20.460
 And what's different about their brain is that in addition to us being able to fuel it in a way that other animals can't,

1:51:20.460 --> 1:51:28.460
 we also have reasons for wanting to have an even bigger brain, whereas we don't want an even bigger heart.

1:51:28.460 --> 1:51:30.460
 So what those reasons are is unclear.

1:51:30.460 --> 1:51:41.460
 But with regard to the costs of maintaining a brain, cooking makes it possible because it's supplying more calories.

1:51:41.460 --> 1:51:47.460
 And it is enormously reducing the amount of time that it takes to chew your food.

1:51:47.460 --> 1:51:55.460
 So if you were a gorilla and you wanted to have a bigger brain, you might say, OK, well, let's just eat some more.

1:51:55.460 --> 1:52:09.460
 But gorillas are eating for pretty much the entire day in the sense that they are eating for maybe seven or eight hours a day in some seasons.

1:52:09.460 --> 1:52:11.460
 That's just chewing.

1:52:11.460 --> 1:52:15.460
 And then they've got to sit around and digest their food because they can't just eat all the time.

1:52:15.460 --> 1:52:23.460
 They've got to take a break while the food is digested in the stomach and then passed into the gut.

1:52:23.460 --> 1:52:26.460
 So the stomach is already full.

1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:30.460
 So basically gorillas are eating about the maximum rate already.

1:52:30.460 --> 1:52:32.460
 So how does a gorilla get a bigger brain?

1:52:32.460 --> 1:52:34.460
 It doesn't.

1:52:34.460 --> 1:52:38.460
 It's actually got a smaller brain relative to his body size than chimpanzee does.

1:52:38.460 --> 1:52:43.460
 And that's the basic problem for our ancestors.

1:52:43.460 --> 1:52:45.460
 Then you come along and cook.

1:52:45.460 --> 1:52:51.460
 And all of a sudden you can get an increased amount of energy from your food.

1:52:51.460 --> 1:52:56.460
 You are spending much less energy on digesting your food.

1:52:56.460 --> 1:53:07.460
 There are 25 bodily processes or more that are involved in digesting your food, making the acid that takes the proteins apart,

1:53:07.460 --> 1:53:14.460
 maintaining the brush border where the molecules are taken across the gut wall, and so on.

1:53:14.460 --> 1:53:16.460
 That all costs.

1:53:16.460 --> 1:53:18.460
 It costs you to digest your food.

1:53:18.460 --> 1:53:20.460
 It costs less if you cook your food.

1:53:20.460 --> 1:53:23.460
 It costs you to gain in the amount of energy.

1:53:23.460 --> 1:53:29.460
 And you are reducing the amount of time from, in our case of our ancestors,

1:53:29.460 --> 1:53:36.460
 probably around 50% of the day chewing to nowadays one hour a day chewing.

1:53:36.460 --> 1:53:40.460
 So all of a sudden you've got hours a day in which to do other things,

1:53:40.460 --> 1:53:44.460
 to use those brains that you've now enabled to grow.

1:53:44.460 --> 1:53:48.460
 So with Homo erectus, you start the process of getting a bigger brain

1:53:48.460 --> 1:53:52.460
 famously throughout the whole period of the evolution of the genus Homo,

1:53:52.460 --> 1:53:56.460
 you have a steadily increasing size of brain.

1:53:56.460 --> 1:54:02.460
 Until right at the end when it actually gets smaller, but that's a different story.

1:54:02.460 --> 1:54:04.460
 Which end is this?

1:54:04.460 --> 1:54:06.460
 We're talking about Homo sapiens?

1:54:06.460 --> 1:54:11.460
 Yeah, with Homo sapiens you've got a smaller brain from,

1:54:11.460 --> 1:54:17.460
 people haven't got it exactly down, but at least 30,000 years ago it starts declining.

1:54:17.460 --> 1:54:22.460
 And so the fascinating thing about that is that all domesticated animals

1:54:22.460 --> 1:54:25.460
 have smaller brains than their wild ancestors.

1:54:30.460 --> 1:54:34.460
 The domestication is intricately connected to this brain size, you think.

1:54:34.460 --> 1:54:35.460
 Exactly.

1:54:35.460 --> 1:54:39.460
 So I think what we're seeing in humans is that same manifestation.

1:54:39.460 --> 1:54:43.460
 And then the fascinating question is why.

1:54:43.460 --> 1:54:48.460
 And the only point I would want to make about this is that there is no evidence

1:54:48.460 --> 1:54:55.460
 that in the small brain domesticates, they're losing say an average about 15% of brain size,

1:54:55.460 --> 1:54:58.460
 in the small brain domesticates compared to their wild ancestors,

1:54:58.460 --> 1:55:03.460
 there's no indication of a loss of cognitive ability.

1:55:03.460 --> 1:55:08.460
 So I think what's going on is that it's a younger brain,

1:55:08.460 --> 1:55:13.460
 it's a more pedomorphic brain looking like the juveniles of the ancestor,

1:55:13.460 --> 1:55:19.460
 but just as our kids are very smart and can learn amazing things compared to adults,

1:55:19.460 --> 1:55:25.460
 all they lack is wisdom and maturity, but in terms of sheer cognitive ability, they got it.

1:55:25.460 --> 1:55:28.460
 And I think that's the same with domesticated animals compared to their wild ancestors,

1:55:28.460 --> 1:55:36.460
 and probably therefore with Homo sapiens say 30,000 years ago compared to their ancestors.

1:55:36.460 --> 1:55:39.460
 So we have smaller brains than Neanderthals.

1:55:39.460 --> 1:55:43.460
 Size, Richard, isn't everything.

1:55:43.460 --> 1:55:44.460
 Exactly.

1:55:44.460 --> 1:55:49.460
 What's the connection between fire, cooking, and the eating of meat?

1:55:49.460 --> 1:55:56.460
 Which came first, do you think, humans starting to enjoy the eating of meat

1:55:56.460 --> 1:56:01.460
 or the invention of fire and the use of fire for cooking?

1:56:01.460 --> 1:56:04.460
 I think that fire increased the use of meat.

1:56:04.460 --> 1:56:12.460
 But the fact that chimpanzees really like to hunt and kill meat, as do bonobos,

1:56:12.460 --> 1:56:14.460
 certainly puts us in...

1:56:14.460 --> 1:56:20.460
 So those two species have a common ancestor with us going six, seven million years ago,

1:56:20.460 --> 1:56:24.460
 and it was from that common ancestor that you get the Australopithecine line.

1:56:24.460 --> 1:56:28.460
 It's very likely therefore Australopithecines were eating meat when they could get it,

1:56:28.460 --> 1:56:31.460
 which wouldn't be very often because they wouldn't be very good sprinters,

1:56:31.460 --> 1:56:34.460
 but nevertheless they would occasionally be able to get some meat

1:56:34.460 --> 1:56:36.460
 and I bet they loved it all the time.

1:56:36.460 --> 1:56:41.460
 And basically all primates like meat if they can get it, almost all of them.

1:56:41.460 --> 1:56:47.460
 But I think fire would have been very important for a couple of reasons.

1:56:47.460 --> 1:56:54.460
 One is that once you eat your food cooked, then you're saving yourself time.

1:56:54.460 --> 1:57:00.460
 By saving yourself time, you can free up

1:57:00.460 --> 1:57:07.460
 the opportunity to go and hunt more because hunting is a high risk, high gain activity.

1:57:07.460 --> 1:57:13.460
 There's every risk that you will get nothing on one particular afternoon that you go off

1:57:13.460 --> 1:57:16.460
 looking for opportunities to kill.

1:57:16.460 --> 1:57:21.460
 But it's high gain because when you do get something, you bring down a kudu,

1:57:21.460 --> 1:57:26.460
 then you've got a serious amount of meat.

1:57:26.460 --> 1:57:32.460
 What did males and females do with the time they were saving from not having to chew their food?

1:57:32.460 --> 1:57:36.460
 I think that in the case of males, it's very reasonable to think,

1:57:36.460 --> 1:57:39.460
 they spent a greatly increased amount of time hunting.

1:57:39.460 --> 1:57:44.460
 So chimpanzees, they hunt maybe two or three times a month

1:57:44.460 --> 1:57:47.460
 and the average hunt length is 20 minutes.

1:57:47.460 --> 1:57:53.460
 With humans, they're hunting maybe 20 times a month

1:57:53.460 --> 1:57:57.460
 and the average hunt length is six hours. So it's a huge difference.

1:57:57.460 --> 1:58:01.460
 And that's possible because the time was available because they were cooking.

1:58:01.460 --> 1:58:03.460
 Less chewing, more hunting.

1:58:03.460 --> 1:58:04.460
 You got it.

1:58:04.460 --> 1:58:10.460
 The other thing is that the meat is so much nicer.

1:58:10.460 --> 1:58:14.460
 So when a chimpanzee kills a monkey,

1:58:14.460 --> 1:58:17.460
 and I mean they are so excited about killing a monkey,

1:58:17.460 --> 1:58:19.460
 they are so excited about going into the hunt

1:58:19.460 --> 1:58:23.460
 and when they make the kill, then the screams everywhere

1:58:23.460 --> 1:58:28.460
 and some try to seize it and capture it and take it away from the others

1:58:28.460 --> 1:58:31.460
 and eventually the strongest one has it

1:58:31.460 --> 1:58:35.460
 and the others sit around begging and trying to get some and tear it off

1:58:35.460 --> 1:58:37.460
 and so they all love it.

1:58:37.460 --> 1:58:40.460
 There are others who he often goes to the top of a tree

1:58:40.460 --> 1:58:44.460
 in order to be able to get away from all of these beggars and scavengers

1:58:44.460 --> 1:58:50.460
 and while he's there, drops of blood or little scraps fall down to the bottom

1:58:50.460 --> 1:58:55.460
 and the junior members of society, you know, the females and young and that sort of thing,

1:58:55.460 --> 1:58:59.460
 they are racing through to find a particular leaf that's got to drop a blood on it

1:58:59.460 --> 1:59:03.460
 so they can lick it. I mean, they love it.

1:59:03.460 --> 1:59:08.460
 But it takes them a lot of time to chew it.

1:59:08.460 --> 1:59:11.460
 I mean, it's the same thing as for cooked food in general.

1:59:11.460 --> 1:59:16.460
 So they are getting meat very slowly into their bodies

1:59:16.460 --> 1:59:19.460
 and there sometimes comes a time when they just say,

1:59:19.460 --> 1:59:25.460
 I've had enough of this, I need real food and they'll drop the meat and go off and eat fruit again

1:59:25.460 --> 1:59:31.460
 because they can get fruit into their bodies so much faster than they can get meat.

1:59:31.460 --> 1:59:34.460
 So once they're cooking, that problem is solved

1:59:34.460 --> 1:59:37.460
 and they can eat the meat so just much more readily.

1:59:37.460 --> 1:59:42.460
 And I think that mediating would become important for two reasons with cooking.

1:59:42.460 --> 1:59:48.460
 So the key, not to oversimplify, but the key moments in human history

1:59:48.460 --> 1:59:55.460
 are with the Homo erectus, the discovery of fire and the use of fire for cooking

1:59:55.460 --> 2:00:02.460
 and then with Homo sapiens, the beta males killing off the alpha males

2:00:02.460 --> 2:00:07.460
 and the cooperation can exist and cooperation leads to communication and language

2:00:07.460 --> 2:00:10.460
 and ideas and sharing of ideas, that kind of thing.

2:00:10.460 --> 2:00:15.460
 Well, yes. The only thing I modify on that is that you have to ask,

2:00:15.460 --> 2:00:20.460
 how is it that the beta males were able to kill the alpha male?

2:00:20.460 --> 2:00:21.460
 Right.

2:00:21.460 --> 2:00:27.460
 And we now know that although chimpanzees do kill males within their own group sometimes,

2:00:27.460 --> 2:00:31.460
 it's not a process of killing the alpha male.

2:00:31.460 --> 2:00:36.460
 It's taking advantage of opportunity when some male gets into a bad position

2:00:36.460 --> 2:00:39.460
 but it's not a systematic ability to kill the alpha male.

2:00:39.460 --> 2:00:42.460
 And you can see why, because they don't have language.

2:00:42.460 --> 2:00:48.460
 And without language, it's very difficult to know how confident you can be

2:00:48.460 --> 2:00:53.460
 of the support of others against a particular individual within your own group.

2:00:53.460 --> 2:00:57.460
 When you're attacking someone from another group, that problem is solved.

2:00:57.460 --> 2:01:01.460
 They all hate the, you know, those guys.

2:01:01.460 --> 2:01:06.460
 But the alpha male has got alliances within his group.

2:01:06.460 --> 2:01:11.460
 Some of those allies might be willing to turn against him.

2:01:11.460 --> 2:01:15.460
 Some of them might be harboring deep feelings of resentment.

2:01:15.460 --> 2:01:17.460
 But how does anyone else know that?

2:01:17.460 --> 2:01:23.460
 So in other words, I think that you have to have some kind of language that is pretty good

2:01:23.460 --> 2:01:31.460
 to solve the problems of gaining confidence that five of you say, you know,

2:01:31.460 --> 2:01:38.460
 or some number can trust each other in this final attack.

2:01:38.460 --> 2:01:42.460
 And, you know, even nowadays it's difficult, you know.

2:01:42.460 --> 2:01:44.460
 You mentioned Stalin.

2:01:44.460 --> 2:01:48.460
 It's like, why was everybody terrified?

2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:50.460
 Any dictator that takes control?

2:01:50.460 --> 2:01:55.460
 Why is all of us as individuals terrified when you know there's millions of us?

2:01:55.460 --> 2:01:57.460
 That's right.

2:01:57.460 --> 2:02:04.460
 And so like that, we lack the language because our basic psychology of fear overtakes us.

2:02:04.460 --> 2:02:06.460
 Like, who can we talk to?

2:02:06.460 --> 2:02:08.460
 Who can we talk to and not get killed ourselves?

2:02:08.460 --> 2:02:10.460
 Exactly. That's right.

2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:16.460
 But do you have this intuition that some kind of language was developing

2:02:16.460 --> 2:02:19.460
 along with this process of beta males taking over?

2:02:19.460 --> 2:02:27.460
 Yes. Yes. I mean, once you have sufficient language to be able to have the beta males conspiring to kill the alpha male,

2:02:27.460 --> 2:02:33.460
 then you have selection in favor of cooperation and tolerance, as we spoke about.

2:02:33.460 --> 2:02:38.460
 And at that point, there will be increased ability to communicate

2:02:38.460 --> 2:02:41.460
 and the language will get richer and better and better.

2:02:41.460 --> 2:02:47.460
 So yes, absolutely. Positive feedback loop once you get the situation started.

2:02:47.460 --> 2:02:55.460
 Can you maybe comment on the full complexity and richness of the human mind through this process?

2:02:55.460 --> 2:03:05.460
 We've been casually saying cooking fire and beta males leading to cooperation.

2:03:05.460 --> 2:03:10.460
 But how does the beauty of the human mind emerge from all of this?

2:03:10.460 --> 2:03:20.460
 Is there other further steps we need to understand or is it as simple as this language emerging from taking over the alpha male and the cooperation?

2:03:20.460 --> 2:03:25.460
 Or am I also over romanticizing how amazing the human mind is?

2:03:25.460 --> 2:03:32.460
 Is it just like one small step in a long journey of evolution?

2:03:32.460 --> 2:03:49.460
 Well, if the beauty of the human mind is the ability of us all to be creative, to explore, that's one kind of beauty.

2:03:49.460 --> 2:03:56.460
 Another kind of beauty is the empathy that we can show.

2:03:56.460 --> 2:04:14.460
 And we think of that as beautiful because it is a kind of rare and special ability compared to the sort of ordinary selfishness that can commonly predominate.

2:04:14.460 --> 2:04:22.460
 I suppose we have to think of different sources for those two types.

2:04:22.460 --> 2:04:33.460
 I suppose a general answer is that there has been selection in favor of bigger brains which probably in general has been associated with increasing cognitive ability.

2:04:33.460 --> 2:04:48.460
 And as that has happened, the complexity of life has increased because people have more and more complex, highly differentiated strategies

2:04:48.460 --> 2:04:53.460
 in response to each other's more complex, highly differentiated strategies.

2:04:53.460 --> 2:04:57.460
 We get to a point where there is deception and self deception.

2:04:57.460 --> 2:05:09.460
 There is a manipulation of ideas through stories that we invent and stories that we pass on.

2:05:09.460 --> 2:05:25.460
 I guess all I'm wanting to say is that there is a world of the mind that evolves in response to these platforms that are put there.

2:05:25.460 --> 2:05:33.460
 The platform of increasing brain size and therefore cognitive ability made possible by increased energy supply.

2:05:33.460 --> 2:05:49.460
 The platform of cooperation and tolerance in a world in which there remains a lot of conflict and therefore a need to respond to the conflict and manipulate your allies appropriately.

2:05:49.460 --> 2:06:03.460
 I don't see beauty as coming totally independently of these things. I don't think there is a selection for staring into the sunset and creating poetry.

2:06:03.460 --> 2:06:16.460
 But I guess sexual selection, males wanting to impress females in different ways will lead to them wanting to show off.

2:06:16.460 --> 2:06:26.460
 Yeah, in all the different ways. So all of these are natural consequences of just coming up with strategies of how to cooperate and how to achieve certain ends.

2:06:26.460 --> 2:06:29.460
 So that's just like a natural question.

2:06:29.460 --> 2:06:33.460
 Yeah, I mean, we haven't spoken about sexual selection, but that is a really important part of it.

2:06:33.460 --> 2:06:46.460
 You know, they try to outcompete each other in normally without any physical conflict just in order to be able to be chosen by mates of the opposite sex.

2:06:46.460 --> 2:06:52.460
 And that is certainly a major source of creativity.

2:06:52.460 --> 2:06:58.460
 So you've studied chimps. You also are the other relatives, gorillas.

2:06:58.460 --> 2:07:03.460
 What do you find beautiful and fascinating about chimps, about gorillas, about humans?

2:07:03.460 --> 2:07:10.460
 Maybe you can paint the whole picture of that evolutionary, that little local pocket of the evolutionary tree.

2:07:10.460 --> 2:07:15.460
 How are we related? What is the common ancestor? What are the interesting differences?

2:07:15.460 --> 2:07:27.460
 I know I'm asking a million questions, but can you paint a map of what are chimps, gorillas and humans, like how we're related and what you find fascinating about each?

2:07:27.460 --> 2:07:45.460
 In Africa, straddling the equator, there is a strip of rainforest that relies on the combination of high temperatures and rainfall that you get around the equator.

2:07:45.460 --> 2:07:57.460
 That rainforest goes into about 22 countries. And throughout those countries, you have chimpanzees, although they've gone extinct in two of them.

2:07:57.460 --> 2:08:09.460
 In just a fraction of them, five countries, you've got gorillas where there are mountains.

2:08:09.460 --> 2:08:16.460
 And in one country, on the left bank of the Great Congo River, you have bonobos.

2:08:16.460 --> 2:08:29.460
 So in the African forest, you've got these three African apes, the only African apes, all of which are very similar in much of their way of life.

2:08:29.460 --> 2:08:40.460
 They walk on their knuckles through the forest, looking for fruit trees and eating herbs when they can't find fruits.

2:08:40.460 --> 2:08:57.460
 Gorillas represent the oldest chain. So about 10 million years ago, maybe as recently as 8 million years ago, the ancestor of gorillas broke off from the ancestor leading to chimps and bonobos and humans.

2:08:57.460 --> 2:09:21.460
 So they've probably remained very similar now to what they were then. They were probably the largest apes living in montane areas and spending more time eating just herbs, stems, not so vitally dependent on fruit.

2:09:21.460 --> 2:09:34.460
 And living in, if it was like the present, groups up to about 50 stable groups with one alpha male who was in charge.

2:09:34.460 --> 2:09:46.460
 Gorillas are wonderfully slow and inquisitive compared to chimps and bonobos.

2:09:46.460 --> 2:09:59.460
 And I had the privilege of spending a week or two with gorillas at Diane Fossey's camp before she was murdered.

2:09:59.460 --> 2:10:17.460
 And I went out with two women, Kelly and Barb, to a particular group. And there was a young female in the group called Simba. And Simba approached us and stared at the two women.

2:10:17.460 --> 2:10:30.460
 And then she came towards me and she very deliberately reached out her knuckles and touched me on the forehead.

2:10:30.460 --> 2:10:37.460
 She was watched in doing this by a young male who was quite keen on her. And he was called Digit.

2:10:37.460 --> 2:10:49.460
 And about five minutes later, Digit stood in front of us on the path and Kelly was in front of me. And then there was Barb and then there was me.

2:10:49.460 --> 2:10:55.460
 And he came charging down the path and he sidestepped around Kelly and he sidestepped around Barb.

2:10:55.460 --> 2:11:04.460
 And me, he just knocked with his arm and sent me flying about five yards into the bushes.

2:11:04.460 --> 2:11:13.460
 And I loved the way that that was a very deliberate response. And I loved the way that Simba had been so interested in me and held my eye.

2:11:13.460 --> 2:11:23.460
 Chimps and bonobos never hold your eye. But gorillas really look as though they're trying to sort of figure out, what are you thinking about?

2:11:23.460 --> 2:11:29.460
 That was a species that goes back for something like 10 million years.

2:11:29.460 --> 2:11:34.460
 In that situation, was there a game being played?

2:11:34.460 --> 2:11:40.460
 Well, I mean, I felt that Digit was telling me, I don't want you messing with Simba.

2:11:40.460 --> 2:11:43.460
 But was Simba using you?

2:11:43.460 --> 2:11:53.460
 Oh, I see. Well, that's a fun idea. I don't see why she should be using me, but you mean testing how strongly Digit was prepared to interview.

2:11:53.460 --> 2:11:59.460
 Exactly. Well, that's come straight out of a sort of adolescent to high school playbook.

2:11:59.460 --> 2:12:08.460
 No, it's nothing wrong with it for that. I never thought of that and you never know.

2:12:08.460 --> 2:12:18.460
 So this is an ancient branch of the evolutionary tree, this gorilla that led to gorillas.

2:12:18.460 --> 2:12:33.460
 So then the next thing that happened on the evolutionary tree was six or seven million years ago when you have the line between chimps and bonobos on the one hand and humans on the other splitting.

2:12:33.460 --> 2:12:46.460
 And basically what happened is that at that point, a chimplike ancestor leaves the forest, gets isolated in an area outside the forest and adapts and that becomes the Australopithecines.

2:12:46.460 --> 2:12:52.460
 And meanwhile the chimpanzees and bonobo ancestor continues in the forest.

2:12:52.460 --> 2:13:00.460
 And later what happens is that one branch of that crosses the Congo River and becomes the bonobos.

2:13:00.460 --> 2:13:04.460
 That was only about two million years ago, maybe one million years ago.

2:13:04.460 --> 2:13:12.460
 Now the chimps that remained in the forest for this time and occupied all the countries across from West to East Africa now.

2:13:12.460 --> 2:13:21.460
 Again, we assume that they're pretty similar to the ones that live nowadays, whether some variation from West to East.

2:13:21.460 --> 2:13:29.460
 And these are animals that live in social communities of between say 20 and 200.

2:13:29.460 --> 2:13:34.460
 They have a lot of them in one group, but they never come together in a single unit.

2:13:34.460 --> 2:13:45.460
 They share an area, a community territory, and that area is defended by males and within it females wander and bring up their young independently.

2:13:45.460 --> 2:13:55.460
 And the females are very scared about the possibility that males will be mean to their infants.

2:13:55.460 --> 2:14:04.460
 And in order to avoid them doing that, they do their best to mate with every single male in the group multiple times.

2:14:04.460 --> 2:14:10.460
 As if to give a memory in that male of, yeah, yeah, I reminded you, so I'm not going to be mean to your baby.

2:14:10.460 --> 2:14:12.460
 So what's wonderful about chimps?

2:14:12.460 --> 2:14:19.460
 Well, you know, as we've spoken about them, you know, they are creative and sort of amazingly human like.

2:14:19.460 --> 2:14:25.460
 But I love the sort of, you know, the quiet moments and here's one.

2:14:25.460 --> 2:14:33.460
 I've got two chimps who are grooming each other on a day when they are utterly exhausted.

2:14:33.460 --> 2:14:39.460
 They've walked 11 kilometers the day before up and down hills.

2:14:39.460 --> 2:14:45.460
 And on this particular day, all they do is they get to one tree and they eat from that tree.

2:14:45.460 --> 2:14:52.460
 And other than that, they only walk about 100 yards and they go back to sleep in the nest in which they woke up.

2:14:52.460 --> 2:14:54.460
 So they're utterly exhausted.

2:14:54.460 --> 2:14:59.460
 And they're just eating nonstop because they're trying to recover their energy.

2:14:59.460 --> 2:15:02.460
 And this is Hugh and Charlie.

2:15:02.460 --> 2:15:08.460
 And we think they're probably brothers that we never actually got the genetic evidence to prove it.

2:15:08.460 --> 2:15:22.460
 Well, I never remember now who it is, but let's say that they both come down from the tree and they're both carrying branches of the food.

2:15:22.460 --> 2:15:24.460
 They're actually seeds from these branches.

2:15:24.460 --> 2:15:33.460
 They're both engaged even in the midday sun when they want to come down and shade themselves for a bit on the ground.

2:15:33.460 --> 2:15:34.460
 They're still eating.

2:15:34.460 --> 2:15:48.460
 But then Charlie finishes his branch and he starts grooming Hugh and Hugh continues eating from his branch.

2:15:48.460 --> 2:16:00.460
 Charlie eventually gets bored of this after a few minutes and he reaches out and he lifts the branch from which Hugh is still taking seeds

2:16:00.460 --> 2:16:08.460
 and puts it over his head and puts it behind his back as far as possible away from Hugh.

2:16:08.460 --> 2:16:10.460
 Hugh doesn't do anything.

2:16:10.460 --> 2:16:14.460
 He just finishes his mouthful and then he turns to Charlie and grooms him.

2:16:14.460 --> 2:16:19.460
 So this very polite way of saying, will you groom me please has worked.

2:16:19.460 --> 2:16:32.460
 Then Hugh grooms around Charlie's back and around to the right side and then down his arm to what point where he can reach the branch again.

2:16:32.460 --> 2:16:35.460
 And then he picks up the branch and continues.

2:16:35.460 --> 2:16:36.460
 Not sure, aren't they?

2:16:36.460 --> 2:16:37.460
 Right.

2:16:37.460 --> 2:16:38.460
 Yeah.

2:16:38.460 --> 2:16:46.460
 So in other words, they have a very sort of simple little strategy, but it just shows the courtesy with which they can treat each other.

2:16:46.460 --> 2:17:01.460
 And the days I love with chimps are when you see that sort of thing or when you see mothers just lying in a sunlit patch in the forest with their babies bouncing on top of them just having a wonderful peaceful time.

2:17:01.460 --> 2:17:05.460
 And that's what most of their lives are like.

2:17:05.460 --> 2:17:16.460
 So chimpanzees are the species that kind of unites the rest of the apes because a gorilla is in many ways just a big version of a chimpanzee.

2:17:16.460 --> 2:17:22.460
 If you can sort of engineer a chimpanzee in your mind to be bigger, it basically turns into a gorilla.

2:17:22.460 --> 2:17:35.460
 And then bonobos on the left bank of the Congo River are like a domesticated form of chimpanzee, but obviously humans didn't domesticate them, so they're self domesticated.

2:17:35.460 --> 2:17:44.460
 They are less aggressive and they show all the marks of domestication that domestication animals do compared to wild animals in their bones.

2:17:44.460 --> 2:17:55.460
 So they have reduced differences between males and females in which the males are more like females, they have smaller brains, they have shorter faces, smaller teeth and smaller bodies.

2:17:55.460 --> 2:17:57.460
 All the things the domesticated animals show.

2:17:57.460 --> 2:18:05.460
 And bonobos live in this environment in a strikingly peaceful way compared to the chimpanzees.

2:18:05.460 --> 2:18:16.460
 There's no indication that they will have these aggressive kills and enough data now to show that there's a statistical difference in the frequency of which it would happen.

2:18:16.460 --> 2:18:21.460
 And bonobos are famously erotic.

2:18:21.460 --> 2:18:33.460
 The females have enlarged sexual parts which swell to a particularly large size compared to the female chimpanzees.

2:18:33.460 --> 2:18:44.460
 And the females have a lot of interactions with each other in which they excitedly rubbed their clitorises together and appeared to have orgasms.

2:18:44.460 --> 2:18:51.460
 And these occur in the context of some kind of social tension.

2:18:51.460 --> 2:19:02.460
 And they sometimes happen before, sometimes happen after the social tension, and they seem to be devices, these interactions for ensuring that everyone's friends

2:19:02.460 --> 2:19:05.460
 and reducing the chances that they're actually going to get into a fight.

2:19:05.460 --> 2:19:13.460
 So it's a kind of conflict resolution through sex or some kind of pleasurable sexual experience.

2:19:13.460 --> 2:19:16.460
 Well, it's often characterized as make love not war, that's right.

2:19:16.460 --> 2:19:18.460
 Make love not war.

2:19:18.460 --> 2:19:26.460
 Okay, you mentioned to me offline that you have a deep love for nature.

2:19:26.460 --> 2:19:37.460
 If we look at the world today, how can we ensure that the beautiful parts of nature remain a big part of our lives?

2:19:37.460 --> 2:19:45.460
 Assuming beings, in the way we think about it, in the way we also keep it around, preserve it.

2:19:45.460 --> 2:19:51.460
 You know, we keep it part of our minds and part of our world.

2:19:51.460 --> 2:20:08.460
 It's a very difficult question because every time there is a conflict between conservation of a natural habitat and allowing people to get a little bit of extra food for their babies,

2:20:08.460 --> 2:20:13.460
 then naturally the tendency is for the humans to win.

2:20:13.460 --> 2:20:21.460
 And so we have this steady erosion in the face of tremendous efforts to conserve nature.

2:20:21.460 --> 2:20:31.460
 We have a continuing steady erosion of habitats and all the species, and the numbers are always in the wrong direction.

2:20:31.460 --> 2:20:39.460
 Occasionally you get sort of wonderful little examples of something being saved, but the overall trend is clear.

2:20:39.460 --> 2:20:45.460
 And it's very difficult to see how one can ever escape that because it's not human.

2:20:45.460 --> 2:20:56.460
 Now that we are essentially a single tribe to want to save an elephant if it means killing 20 humans.

2:20:56.460 --> 2:21:14.460
 So I think the only way in which we can really conserve is if we put tremendous effort into conserving the very best representative areas of nature.

2:21:14.460 --> 2:21:18.460
 Often this will be the national parks that already exist.

2:21:18.460 --> 2:21:29.460
 And what we have to do is to make them so valuable that actually it is worth it in terms of human survival to be able to keep those sorts of places.

2:21:29.460 --> 2:21:40.460
 And that's the attitude that my colleagues and I have taken in Uganda where we want to keep the Kibali National Park alive,

2:21:40.460 --> 2:21:47.460
 which has got the largest population in chimpanzees in Uganda and it's got elephants and wonderful birds and wonderful butterflies and wonderful plants and so on.

2:21:47.460 --> 2:21:52.460
 And visitors and lots and lots of visitors.

2:21:52.460 --> 2:22:02.460
 It may be that we're going to have to have huge increases in the amount of charges that you pay for ecotourism and you need to make sure ecotourism is done right.

2:22:02.460 --> 2:22:14.460
 In other places you will keep nature there because it's useful for maintaining the climate, bringing rain.

2:22:14.460 --> 2:22:29.460
 Maybe you can in some places convince people of the sheer sort of aesthetics of keeping nature that even over the long term,

2:22:29.460 --> 2:22:40.460
 presidents whose job it is to look for the future of the country will be persuaded that you can do it for purely aesthetic reasons.

2:22:40.460 --> 2:23:02.460
 But overall, what is required is for people in the rich countries to do much more investment than they have so far in maintaining both the natural places in their own countries and in the tropics.

2:23:02.460 --> 2:23:16.460
 And if you look at Africa, the population trends are that Nigeria may become the most populous country in the world, I think, within a century.

2:23:16.460 --> 2:23:23.460
 The future of African habitats, it's clear what's going to happen in general.

2:23:23.460 --> 2:23:29.460
 There's going to be a huge conversion towards agricultural land.

2:23:29.460 --> 2:23:43.460
 I heard Ed Wilson speak years ago about the prospect of the entire globe being turned into a single human feedlot.

2:23:43.460 --> 2:23:46.460
 It's going to take a lot to avoid that.

2:23:46.460 --> 2:23:54.460
 He is out there calling for half the earth to be devoted to nature.

2:23:54.460 --> 2:24:03.460
 It's incredibly ambitious and incredibly optimistic, but unless you have really exciting goals, probably nothing will be achieved.

2:24:03.460 --> 2:24:04.460
 Yeah.

2:24:04.460 --> 2:24:14.460
 I mean, there's something to me like when I visit New York and I see Central Park and somehow constructed a situation where you preserve this park in the middle,

2:24:14.460 --> 2:24:17.460
 probably some of the most expensive land in the world.

2:24:17.460 --> 2:24:23.460
 The fact that that's possible gives me hope that you can do this kind of preservation at a global scale.

2:24:23.460 --> 2:24:35.460
 Perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons of just valuing the beauty and disrespecting our origins of having come from the earth.

2:24:35.460 --> 2:24:44.460
 We are so incredibly lucky to have chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas as our close relatives still living on the earth.

2:24:44.460 --> 2:24:54.460
 We're unlucky that we don't have Australopithecines and other species of homo, but we're still lucky to have those because they are incredibly closely related to us compared to what most animals have.

2:24:54.460 --> 2:25:03.460
 There are many animals that don't have any close relatives to them on the earth, but not only are they relatively close, but they teach us so much about ourselves.

2:25:03.460 --> 2:25:18.460
 The similarities between them and ourselves raise questions that we can then test about the extent to which our own behavioral propensities are derived from the same evolutionary stock as in those great apes.

2:25:18.460 --> 2:25:20.460
 Well, how much is that worth?

2:25:20.460 --> 2:25:29.460
 I mean, we could spend billions going to the Mars to find evidence of bacteria there, and that's fascinating too.

2:25:29.460 --> 2:25:44.460
 But we should be spending billions on this earth in order to make sure that we have, I don't know how to say it, substantial representative populations of these close relatives.

2:25:44.460 --> 2:25:46.460
 Yeah, that we can meet.

2:25:46.460 --> 2:25:57.460
 There's something like space tourism, when you go out into space and you look back down on earth, that's to a lot of people, including myself, is worth a lot.

2:25:57.460 --> 2:25:59.460
 But why is that worth a lot?

2:25:59.460 --> 2:26:12.460
 It's because it's humbling and beautiful in the same way that meeting our close evolutionary relatives is humbling and beautiful.

2:26:12.460 --> 2:26:17.460
 Just to know that this is what we come from.

2:26:17.460 --> 2:26:25.460
 This is who we are, not just for the understanding or the science of it, but just like something about just the beauty of witnessing this.

2:26:25.460 --> 2:26:35.460
 And again, it's both humbling and empowering that this place is fragile and we're damn lucky to be here.

2:26:35.460 --> 2:26:42.460
 Yes, unfortunately, the problems are incredibly difficult to solve and there is no one solver.

2:26:42.460 --> 2:26:47.460
 It has to happen from a network of potentially cooperating people.

2:26:47.460 --> 2:26:58.460
 But you're so right about it being daunting to think about what it looks like from space and I love the view that Herman Muller expressed of being able to go out from space.

2:26:58.460 --> 2:27:06.460
 And he said, the whole of life would look like a kind of rust on the planet.

2:27:06.460 --> 2:27:08.460
 Yeah, so the aliens were to visit.

2:27:08.460 --> 2:27:10.460
 I'm not sure they would notice the life.

2:27:10.460 --> 2:27:15.460
 They would probably notice the trees or ocean.

2:27:15.460 --> 2:27:17.460
 It's a kind of rust.

2:27:17.460 --> 2:27:23.460
 But let me ask the big ridiculous philosophical question of what is the meaning of this rust?

2:27:23.460 --> 2:27:25.460
 What do you think is the meaning of life on earth?

2:27:25.460 --> 2:27:30.460
 What is the meaning of our human intelligent life?

2:27:30.460 --> 2:27:40.460
 Well, I think it's very clear that we have an evolutionary story that is only getting challenged around the edges.

2:27:40.460 --> 2:27:45.460
 We have a very clear understanding of the evolution of life.

2:27:45.460 --> 2:28:09.460
 And the meaning is we are here as a consequence of materialistic processes that began in our sense with the establishment of the earth four and a half billion years ago, whatever it was, and then water and oxygen and so on.

2:28:09.460 --> 2:28:23.460
 And we are the astonishing consequence of the evolution of cells and multicellular organisms.

2:28:23.460 --> 2:28:30.460
 The word random is the wrong word to use unless you understand what it means.

2:28:30.460 --> 2:28:37.460
 It didn't happen by chance, but a lot of random events had to happen to make this possible.

2:28:37.460 --> 2:28:42.460
 And those random events, of course, are the production of appropriate mutations.

2:28:42.460 --> 2:28:49.460
 But the meaning of life is there is no meaning.

2:28:49.460 --> 2:28:54.460
 The really big mystery of life is why is there a universe?

2:28:54.460 --> 2:29:16.460
 And that's saying why propagates itself through the whole process of it, for the emergence of planets, the origins, first of all, of galaxies, of star systems, of planets, of the proteins required to construct the single cell organisms and the single cell organism becoming complex organisms,

2:29:16.460 --> 2:29:30.460
 and some of the clever fish crawling out onto the land and the whole of it, and then there's fire, some clever guy or lady invented fire, and then now here we are.

2:29:30.460 --> 2:29:37.460
 It just does seem, speaking as a human, kind of special that we're able to reflect on the whole thing.

2:29:37.460 --> 2:29:42.460
 Wonderful story, so much more interesting than the stories produced by religion.

2:29:42.460 --> 2:29:53.460
 It is beautiful, but it just seems special that us humans are able to write religions and construct stories and also do science.

2:29:53.460 --> 2:29:58.460
 That seems kind of amazing.

2:29:58.460 --> 2:30:12.460
 It seems like the universe is such that it creates beings like us that are able to investigate it.

2:30:12.460 --> 2:30:16.460
 And that's why there's this longing for why.

2:30:16.460 --> 2:30:23.460
 It's just such a beautiful little pocket of complexity created by the universe.

2:30:23.460 --> 2:30:34.460
 It seems like there should be a why, but maybe there's just an infinite number of universes, and this is the one that led to this particular set of humans.

2:30:34.460 --> 2:30:38.460
 Even without an infinite number of universes, I bet there's an infinite number of intelligent beings.

2:30:38.460 --> 2:30:40.460
 Throughout this universe.

2:30:40.460 --> 2:30:47.460
 Yeah, now that we know how many planets have the right sort of conditions, which is what, I can't remember, a lot.

2:30:47.460 --> 2:30:51.460
 It's some significant percentage of all planets.

2:30:51.460 --> 2:31:00.460
 Then there are apparently billions of planets, and things happen so quickly on Earth.

2:31:00.460 --> 2:31:09.460
 Once you've got water, then you've got life, and it did not take long for life to evolve in the big scheme of things.

2:31:09.460 --> 2:31:16.460
 And if you think, you look out there, say there's a nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations.

2:31:16.460 --> 2:31:21.460
 One dimension you can look at is the proclivity to violence they have.

2:31:21.460 --> 2:31:30.460
 And it's interesting to think what level of violence is useful for extending the life of a civilization.

2:31:30.460 --> 2:31:37.460
 So we have a particular set of violence in our history, maybe being too peaceful is a problem in the early days.

2:31:37.460 --> 2:31:41.460
 Maybe being too violent, quite obviously, is a problem.

2:31:41.460 --> 2:31:46.460
 So you look at viruses, what kind of viruses on Earth propagate and succeed.

2:31:46.460 --> 2:31:49.460
 If you're too deadly, that's a big problem.

2:31:49.460 --> 2:31:52.460
 If you're not deadly enough, that's also a problem.

2:31:52.460 --> 2:31:55.460
 So that is a fascinating exploration of...

2:31:55.460 --> 2:31:57.460
 I don't see any evidence.

2:31:57.460 --> 2:32:01.460
 There's no way you're coming from when you say that being too peaceful is a problem.

2:32:01.460 --> 2:32:12.460
 Well, because I'll say it this way, death is a way to get rid of suboptimal solutions.

2:32:12.460 --> 2:32:13.460
 So violence...

2:32:13.460 --> 2:32:15.460
 But there's lots of ways to die without violence.

2:32:15.460 --> 2:32:16.460
 Right.

2:32:16.460 --> 2:32:19.460
 To me, death in itself is violence.

2:32:19.460 --> 2:32:21.460
 And you can...

2:32:21.460 --> 2:32:26.460
 I mean, a lot of people that talk about, for example, longevity and disease and all that kind of stuff,

2:32:26.460 --> 2:32:31.460
 they see death is the way they talk about it.

2:32:31.460 --> 2:32:33.460
 And it's interesting to philosophically think of it that way.

2:32:33.460 --> 2:32:37.460
 So death is like mass murder that's happening.

2:32:37.460 --> 2:32:42.460
 And people that try to, from a biological perspective, help extend life,

2:32:42.460 --> 2:32:47.460
 they see that you're helping the most...

2:32:47.460 --> 2:32:52.460
 The biggest atrocity in the history of human civilization from their perspective

2:32:52.460 --> 2:32:59.460
 is not allocating all our resources to solving death.

2:32:59.460 --> 2:33:02.460
 Because death is a kind of violence.

2:33:02.460 --> 2:33:07.460
 It is a kind of murder that we're allowing to be committed on us by nature.

2:33:07.460 --> 2:33:14.460
 So the flip side of that is death makes way for new life, for new ideas.

2:33:14.460 --> 2:33:19.460
 Yes, but that's got nothing to do with peace versus war.

2:33:19.460 --> 2:33:24.460
 You have animals that are very, very peaceful, but they evolve just in the same way as other animals do.

2:33:24.460 --> 2:33:28.460
 They just don't do it with death caused by violence.

2:33:28.460 --> 2:33:31.460
 And violent death is premature death, surely.

2:33:31.460 --> 2:33:34.460
 I mean, I don't mind about people dying.

2:33:34.460 --> 2:33:40.460
 What I mind about is people dying in their youth.

2:33:40.460 --> 2:33:41.460
 Prematurely.

2:33:41.460 --> 2:33:44.460
 But some people would say all death is premature.

2:33:44.460 --> 2:33:46.460
 It certainly feels that way.

2:33:46.460 --> 2:33:49.460
 It's died too soon.

2:33:49.460 --> 2:33:52.460
 Anyone who's ever died died too soon.

2:33:52.460 --> 2:33:57.460
 Yeah, well, I mean, if we can become like sequoias and live for hundreds of years

2:33:57.460 --> 2:34:00.460
 or thousands of years, that would be great.

2:34:00.460 --> 2:34:02.460
 Do you ponder your own mortality?

2:34:02.460 --> 2:34:04.460
 Are you afraid of death?

2:34:04.460 --> 2:34:06.460
 I don't think I'm afraid of it.

2:34:06.460 --> 2:34:10.460
 I'm reconciled to the fact it's going to happen.

2:34:10.460 --> 2:34:13.460
 I just feel frustrated because I enjoy life.

2:34:13.460 --> 2:34:19.460
 And I don't want to leave the party.

2:34:19.460 --> 2:34:22.460
 Yeah, it's kind of a fun party.

2:34:22.460 --> 2:34:25.460
 I don't want to leave the party either.

2:34:25.460 --> 2:34:28.460
 So however we got here, we made one heck of an awesome party.

2:34:28.460 --> 2:34:30.460
 And you're right.

2:34:30.460 --> 2:34:35.460
 Having a party with a little bit less violence than it is an even more fun party.

2:34:35.460 --> 2:34:38.460
 Richard, I'm deeply honored that you spent time with me today.

2:34:38.460 --> 2:34:40.460
 Your work is amazing.

2:34:40.460 --> 2:34:45.460
 It includes some of the deepest thinking about our human history

2:34:45.460 --> 2:34:47.460
 and the nature of human civilization.

2:34:47.460 --> 2:34:50.460
 So again, thank you so much for talking today.

2:34:50.460 --> 2:34:51.460
 It's an honor.

2:34:51.460 --> 2:34:52.460
 Thanks for your great questions.

2:34:52.460 --> 2:34:54.460
 It's a really fun conversation.

2:34:54.460 --> 2:34:58.460
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Rangham.

2:35:02.460 --> 2:35:05.460
 And now let me leave you some words from Jane Goodall.

2:35:05.460 --> 2:35:09.460
 The greatest danger to our future is apathy.

2:35:09.460 --> 2:35:13.460
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
