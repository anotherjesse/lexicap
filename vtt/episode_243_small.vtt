00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
 The following is a conversation with Kevin Systrom, cofounder and longtime CEO of Instagram,

00:06.560 --> 00:11.840
 including for six years after Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. This is the Lex

00:11.840 --> 00:17.040
 Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,

00:17.600 --> 00:24.560
 here's my conversation with Kevin Systrom. At the risk of asking the Rolling Stones

00:24.560 --> 00:28.240
 to play satisfaction, let me ask you about the origin story of Instagram.

00:28.240 --> 00:34.000
 Sure. So maybe some context, you, like we were talking about offline, grew up in Massachusetts,

00:34.640 --> 00:40.720
 learned computer programming there, liked to play Doom II, worked at a vinyl record store,

00:40.720 --> 00:48.240
 then you went to Stanford, turned down Mr. Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook, went to Florence to study

00:48.240 --> 00:55.040
 photography. Those are just some random, beautiful, impossibly brief glimpses into a life. So let me

00:55.040 --> 00:59.120
 ask again, can you take me through the origin story of Instagram? Give me that context.

00:59.120 --> 01:05.360
 Yeah, you basically set it up. All right. So we have a fair amount of time. So I'll go into some

01:05.360 --> 01:12.800
 detail. But basically what I'll say is Instagram started out of a company actually called Bourbon,

01:13.360 --> 01:19.920
 and it was spelled B U R B N. And a couple of things were happening at the time. So if we zoom

01:19.920 --> 01:26.720
 back to 2010, not a lot of people remember what was happening in the dot com world then. But

01:27.360 --> 01:33.440
 check in apps were all the rage. So what's the checking out? Gawalla, Foursquare, Hot Potato.

01:34.240 --> 01:39.040
 So I'm at a place, I'm going to tell the world that I'm at this place. That's right. What's the

01:39.040 --> 01:43.280
 idea behind this kind of app, by the way? You know what, I'm going to answer that, but through

01:44.000 --> 01:49.200
 what Instagram became and why I believe Instagram replaced them. So the whole idea was to share

01:49.200 --> 01:54.240
 with the world what you were doing specifically with your friends, right? But there were all

01:54.240 --> 01:57.600
 the rage and Foursquare was getting all the press and I remember sitting around saying,

01:57.600 --> 02:01.520
 hey, I want to build something, but I don't know what I want to build. What if I built a better

02:02.320 --> 02:08.480
 version of Foursquare? And I asked myself, well, why don't I like Foursquare or how could it be

02:08.480 --> 02:16.400
 improved? And basically I sat down and I said, I think that if you have a few extra features,

02:16.400 --> 02:19.600
 it might be enough. One of which happened to be posting a photo of where you were.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.960
 There were some others. It turns out that wasn't enough. My cofounder joined. We were going to

02:24.960 --> 02:31.200
 attack Foursquare and the likes and try to build something interesting. And no one used it. No

02:31.200 --> 02:36.400
 one cared because it wasn't enough. It wasn't different enough, right? So one day we were

02:36.400 --> 02:41.520
 sitting down and we asked ourselves, okay, let's come to Jesus moment. Are we going to do this

02:41.520 --> 02:46.880
 startup? And if we're going to, we can't do what we're currently doing. We have to switch it up.

02:46.880 --> 02:52.160
 So what do people love the most? So we sat down and we wrote out three things that we thought

02:52.160 --> 02:58.080
 people uniquely loved about our products that weren't in other products. Photos happen to be the

02:58.080 --> 03:04.000
 top one. So sharing a photo of what you were doing, where you were at the moment was not something

03:04.640 --> 03:10.640
 products let you do really. Facebook was like, post an album of your vacation from two weeks ago,

03:10.640 --> 03:16.000
 right? Twitter allowed you to post a photo but their feed was primarily text and they didn't

03:16.000 --> 03:21.520
 show the photo in line. Or at least I don't think they did at the time. So even though it seems

03:21.520 --> 03:28.240
 totally stupid and obvious to us now, at the moment then, posting a photo of what you were

03:28.240 --> 03:35.120
 doing at the moment was like not a thing. So we decided to go after that because we'd noticed that

03:35.120 --> 03:39.440
 people who used our service, the one thing they happened to like the most was posting a photo.

03:39.440 --> 03:44.400
 So that was the beginning of Instagram. And yes, we went through and we added filters and

03:44.400 --> 03:48.800
 there's a bunch of stories around that. But the origin of this was that we were trying to be a

03:48.800 --> 03:54.080
 check and app, realized that no one wanted another check and app. It became a photo sharing app but

03:54.080 --> 03:58.720
 one that was much more about what you're doing and where you are. And that's why when I say I think

03:58.720 --> 04:06.400
 we've replaced check and apps, it became a check in via a photo rather than saying your location

04:06.400 --> 04:10.320
 and then optionally adding a photo. When you were thinking about what people like,

04:11.440 --> 04:16.560
 from where did you get a sense that this is what people like? You said we sat down, we wrote some

04:16.560 --> 04:23.440
 stuff down on paper. Where is that intuition that seems fundamental to the success of

04:24.800 --> 04:29.680
 an app like Instagram? Where does that idea, where does that list of three things come from?

04:30.240 --> 04:34.800
 Exactly. Only after having studied machine learning now for a couple of years,

04:34.800 --> 04:43.200
 you have understood yourself. I've started to make connections. We can go into this later.

04:43.200 --> 04:52.000
 But obviously, the connections between machine learning and the human brain I think are

04:52.000 --> 04:59.520
 stretched sometimes. At the same time, being able to back prop and being able to look at the world,

04:59.520 --> 05:06.080
 try something, figure out how you're wrong, how wrong you are, and then nudge your company in

05:06.080 --> 05:13.440
 the right direction based on how wrong you are. It's like a fascinating concept. We didn't know

05:13.440 --> 05:18.720
 we were doing it at the time but that's basically what we were doing. We put it out to call it 100

05:18.720 --> 05:26.000
 people and you would look at their data. You would say, what are they sharing? What resonates,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.840
 what doesn't resonate? We think they're going to resonate with X, but it turns out they resonate

05:29.840 --> 05:36.240
 with Y. Okay, shift the company towards Y. It turns out if you do that enough quickly enough,

05:36.240 --> 05:42.560
 you can get to a solution that has product market fit. Most companies fail because they sit there

05:42.560 --> 05:47.840
 and either their learning rate is too slow, they sit there and they're adamant that they're right

05:47.840 --> 05:53.200
 even though the data is telling them they're not right, or they're learning rates too high and

05:53.200 --> 05:58.560
 they wildly chase different ideas and they never actually sit on one where they don't groove.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.720
 And I think when we sat down and we wrote out those three ideas, what we were saying is,

06:03.280 --> 06:11.120
 what are the three possible, whether they're local or global, maxima in our world, that

06:11.120 --> 06:15.680
 users are telling us they like because they're using the product that way? It was clear people

06:15.680 --> 06:20.560
 like the photos because that was the thing they were doing. And we just said, okay, what if we

06:20.560 --> 06:26.080
 just cut out most of the other stuff and focus on that thing? And then it happened to be a

06:26.080 --> 06:32.880
 multi billion dollar business. And it's that easy, by the way. Yeah, I guess so. Well, nobody ever

06:32.880 --> 06:38.320
 writes about neural networks that miserably failed. So this particular neural network succeeded.

06:38.320 --> 06:42.880
 Oh, they fail all the time, right? Yeah. But nobody writes about... The default state is failing.

06:42.880 --> 06:50.160
 Yes. When you said the way people are using the app, is that the loss function for this

06:50.160 --> 06:55.520
 neural network or is it also self report? Do you ever ask people what they like or do you have to

06:56.640 --> 07:02.240
 track exactly what they're doing, not what they're saying? I once made a Thanksgiving dinner. Okay.

07:03.040 --> 07:10.960
 And it was for relatives and I like to cook a lot. Okay. And I worked really hard on picking the

07:10.960 --> 07:18.320
 specific dishes. And I was really proud because I had planned it out using a Gantt chart and

07:18.320 --> 07:22.320
 like it was ready on time and everything was hot. Nice. Like, I don't know if you're a big

07:22.320 --> 07:27.280
 Thanksgiving guy, but like the worst thing about Thanksgiving is when the turkey is cold and some

07:27.280 --> 07:31.120
 things are hot and something... Anyway, you got a Gantt chart. Did you actually have a chart?

07:31.120 --> 07:37.120
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Omni plan. Fairly expensive, like Gantt chart thing that I think maybe 10 people

07:37.120 --> 07:42.640
 have purchased in the world. But I'm one of them and I use it for recipe planning only around

07:42.640 --> 07:48.800
 big holidays. That's brilliant, by the way. Do people do this kind of... Over engineering?

07:48.800 --> 07:52.960
 It's not over. It's just engineering. It's planning. Thanksgiving is a complicated

07:53.840 --> 07:58.240
 set of events with some uncertainty with a lot of things going on. You should be able...

07:58.240 --> 08:01.440
 You should be planning in this way. There should be a chart. It's not over.

08:01.440 --> 08:08.000
 I mean, so what's funny is brief aside. Yes. Brilliant. I love cooking. I love food. I love

08:08.000 --> 08:14.160
 coffee. And I've spent some time with some chefs who know their stuff. And they always just take

08:14.160 --> 08:19.600
 out a piece of paper and just work backwards in rough order. Like, it's never perfect, but rough

08:19.600 --> 08:24.640
 order. It's just like, oh, that makes sense. Why not just work backwards from the end goal, right?

08:24.640 --> 08:30.080
 And put in some buffer time. And so I probably over specified it a bit using a Gantt chart. But

08:30.080 --> 08:36.080
 the fact that you can do it, it's what professional kitchens roughly do. They just don't call it a

08:36.080 --> 08:40.240
 Gantt chart. Or at least I don't think they do. Anyway, I was telling a story about Thanksgiving.

08:40.240 --> 08:47.680
 So here's the thing. I'm sitting down. We have the meal. And then I got to know Ray Dalio

08:48.320 --> 08:55.040
 fairly well over maybe the last year of Instagram. And one thing that he kept saying was like,

08:55.040 --> 09:02.320
 feedback is really hard to get honestly from people. And I sat down at... After dinner, I said,

09:02.320 --> 09:08.320
 guys, I want feedback. What was good and what was bad? Yes. And what's funny is like, literally,

09:08.320 --> 09:13.920
 everyone just said everything was great. And I personally knew I had screwed up a handful of

09:13.920 --> 09:20.720
 things. But no one would say it. And can you imagine now, not something as high stakes as

09:20.720 --> 09:25.600
 Thanksgiving dinner, okay? Thanksgiving dinner, it's not that high stakes. But you're trying to

09:25.600 --> 09:29.360
 build a product and everyone knows you left your job for it, and you're trying to build it out,

09:29.360 --> 09:34.320
 and you're trying to make something wonderful. And it's yours, right? You designed it.

09:35.440 --> 09:40.640
 Now try asking for feedback. And know that you're giving this to your friends and your family.

09:42.160 --> 09:48.640
 People have trouble giving hard feedback. People have trouble saying, I don't like this,

09:48.640 --> 09:56.480
 or this isn't great, or this is how it's failed me. In fact, you usually have two classes of people,

09:56.480 --> 10:01.360
 people who just won't say bad things. You can literally say to them, please tell me what you

10:01.360 --> 10:06.320
 hate most about this, and they won't do it. They'll try, but they won't. And then the other class

10:06.320 --> 10:13.360
 of people are just negative period about everything. And it's hard to parse out what is true and what

10:13.360 --> 10:21.040
 isn't. So my rule of thumb with this is you should always ask people. But at the end of the day,

10:21.040 --> 10:25.760
 it's amazing what data will tell you. And that's why with whatever project I work on,

10:25.760 --> 10:32.240
 even now, collecting data from the beginning on usage patterns, so engagement, how many days of

10:32.240 --> 10:36.880
 the week, do they use it? How many, I don't know, if we were to go back to Instagram, how many

10:36.880 --> 10:42.320
 impressions per day, right? Is that growing? Is that shrinking? And don't be like overly

10:43.200 --> 10:47.280
 scientific about it, right? Because maybe you have 50 beta users or something.

10:47.280 --> 10:56.800
 But what's fascinating is that data doesn't lie. People are very defensive about their time.

10:57.360 --> 11:03.840
 They'll say, oh, I'm so busy. I'm sorry. I didn't get to use the app. But I don't know.

11:03.840 --> 11:10.080
 You were posting on Instagram the whole time. So I don't know. At the end of the day, at Facebook,

11:10.080 --> 11:19.120
 there was before time spent became kind of this loaded term there. The idea that people's currency

11:19.120 --> 11:23.760
 in their lives is time. And they only have a certain amount of time to give things, whether it's

11:23.760 --> 11:29.200
 friends or family or apps or TV shows or whatever. There's no way of inventing more of it, at least

11:29.200 --> 11:38.160
 not that I know of. If they don't use it, it's because it's not great. So the moral of the story

11:38.160 --> 11:45.280
 is you can ask all you want, but you just have to look at the data. And data doesn't lie, right?

11:45.280 --> 11:54.160
 I mean, there's metrics. There's data can obscure the key insight if you're not careful. So

11:55.760 --> 12:00.160
 time spent in the app, that's one, there's so many metrics you can put at this. And they will

12:00.160 --> 12:05.280
 give you totally different insights, especially when you're trying to create something that doesn't

12:05.280 --> 12:15.760
 obviously exist yet. So, you know, measuring maybe why you left the app or measuring special

12:15.760 --> 12:21.440
 moments of happiness that will make sure you return to the app or moments of happiness that

12:21.440 --> 12:27.760
 are long lasting versus like dopamine short term, all of those things. But I think I suppose in the

12:27.760 --> 12:35.520
 beginning, you can just get away with just asking the question, which features are used a lot? Let's

12:35.520 --> 12:43.040
 do more of that. And how hard was the decision? And I mean, maybe you can tell me what Instagram

12:43.040 --> 12:48.320
 looked in the beginning, but how hard was it to make pictures the first class citizen?

12:48.320 --> 12:56.800
 That's a revolutionary idea. Like, at whatever point Instagram became this feed of photos.

12:56.800 --> 13:03.920
 That's quite brilliant. Plus, also don't know when this happened, but they're all shaped the same.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.720
 It's like, I have to tell you why that's the interesting part.

13:10.400 --> 13:17.600
 Why is that? So a couple of things. One is data data, like you're right, you can overinterpret

13:17.600 --> 13:24.320
 data. Like imagine trying to fly a plane by staring at, I don't know, a single metric like

13:24.320 --> 13:28.400
 airspeed. You don't know if you're going up or down. I mean, it correlates with up or down,

13:28.400 --> 13:33.760
 but you don't actually know. It will never help you land the plane. So don't stare at one metric.

13:33.760 --> 13:37.440
 Like it turns out you have to synthesize a bunch of metrics to know where to go.

13:38.640 --> 13:44.000
 But it doesn't lie. Like if your speed is zero, unless it's not working, right? If it's zero,

13:44.720 --> 13:49.600
 you're probably going to fall out of the sky. So generally, you look around and you have the scan

13:49.600 --> 13:57.040
 going. Yes. And you're just asking yourself, is this working or is this not working? But people

13:57.040 --> 14:05.600
 have trouble explaining how they actually feel. So it's about synthesizing both of them. So

14:05.600 --> 14:11.760
 then Instagram, right? We were talking about revolutionary moment where the feed became

14:11.760 --> 14:20.320
 square photos basically. And photos first and then square photos. Yeah. It was clear to me

14:20.320 --> 14:29.440
 that the biggest, so I believe the biggest companies are founded when enormous technical

14:29.440 --> 14:34.720
 shifts happen. And the biggest technical shift that happened right before Instagram was founded

14:34.720 --> 14:40.000
 was the advent of a phone that didn't suck, the iPhone, right? Like in retrospect, we're like,

14:40.000 --> 14:45.920
 oh my God, the first iPhone that almost had, like it wasn't that good. But compared to everything

14:45.920 --> 14:53.680
 else at the time, it was amazing. And by the way, the first phone that had an incredible camera

14:54.560 --> 15:01.120
 that could do as well as the point and shoot you might carry around was the iPhone 4. And that

15:01.120 --> 15:06.080
 was right when Instagram launched. And we looked around and we said, what will change because

15:06.080 --> 15:13.120
 everyone has a camera in their pocket? And it was so clear to me that the world of social networks

15:13.120 --> 15:19.600
 before it was based in the desktop and sitting there and having a link you could share, right?

15:20.560 --> 15:23.680
 And that wasn't going to be the case. So the question is, what would you share if you were

15:23.680 --> 15:29.760
 out and about in the world? If not only did you have a camera that fit in your pocket, but by the

15:29.760 --> 15:35.200
 way, that camera had a network attached to it that allowed you to share instantly. That seemed

15:35.200 --> 15:38.880
 revolutionary. And a bunch of people saw it at the same time. It wasn't just Instagram. There were

15:38.880 --> 15:45.280
 a bunch of competitors. The thing we did, I think, was not only, well, we focused on two things. So

15:45.280 --> 15:49.280
 we wrote down those things. We circled photos and we said, I think we should invest in this.

15:49.840 --> 15:56.480
 But then we said, what sucks about photos? One, they look like crap, right? They just, at least

15:56.480 --> 16:03.120
 back then. Now, my phone takes pretty great photos, right? Back then, they were blurry,

16:03.120 --> 16:11.120
 not so great, compressed, right? Two, it was really slow, like really slow to upload a photo.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.400
 And I'll tell a fun story about that and explain to you why they're all the same size and square as

16:16.400 --> 16:23.680
 well. And three, man, if you wanted to share a photo on different networks, you had to go to

16:23.680 --> 16:29.040
 each of the individual apps and select all of them and upload individually. And so we were like,

16:29.040 --> 16:33.920
 all right, those are the pain points. We're going to focus on that. So one, instead of, because

16:33.920 --> 16:38.240
 they weren't beautiful, we were like, why don't we lean into the fact that they're not beautiful?

16:38.240 --> 16:43.200
 And I remember studying in Florence, my photography teacher gave me this Holga camera. And I'm not

16:43.200 --> 16:46.720
 sure everyone knows what a Holga camera is, but they're these old school plastic cameras.

16:48.240 --> 16:53.920
 I think they're produced in China at the time. And I want to say the original ones,

16:53.920 --> 16:59.760
 like from the 70s or the 80s or something, they're supposed to be like $3 cameras for the every person.

16:59.760 --> 17:07.680
 They took nice medium format films, large, large negatives, but they kind of blurred the light

17:07.680 --> 17:12.800
 and they kind of like light leaked into the side. And there was this whole resurgence where people

17:12.800 --> 17:18.400
 looked at that and said, oh my God, this is a style, right? And I remember using that in Florence

17:18.400 --> 17:22.640
 and just saying, well, why don't we just like lean into the fact that these photos suck and make them

17:22.640 --> 17:28.720
 suck more, but in an artistic way. And it turns out that had product market fit. People really

17:28.720 --> 17:34.000
 like that. They were willing to share their not so great photos if they looked not so great on

17:34.000 --> 17:41.120
 purpose. The second part. That's where the filters come into the picture. So computational

17:41.120 --> 17:48.080
 modification of photos to make them look extra crappy to where it becomes art. Yeah. And I mean,

17:48.080 --> 17:52.960
 add light leaks, add like an overlay filter and make them more contrasty than they should be.

17:52.960 --> 17:59.440
 The first filter we ever produced was called X Pro 2. And I designed it while I was in this

17:59.440 --> 18:04.320
 small little bed and breakfast room in Toto Santos, Mexico. I was trying to take a break from the

18:05.200 --> 18:09.680
 bourbon days. And I remember saying to my cofounder, I just need like a week to reset.

18:10.320 --> 18:15.840
 And that was on that trip, worked on the first filter because I said, you know, I think I can

18:15.840 --> 18:22.720
 I think I can do this. And I literally iterated one by one over the RGB values in the array that

18:22.720 --> 18:29.200
 was the photo and just slightly shifted. Basically, there was a function of our function of G,

18:29.200 --> 18:35.440
 function of B that just shifted them slightly on some rocket science. And it turns out that

18:35.440 --> 18:41.360
 actually made your photo look pretty cool. It's just mapped from one color space to another color

18:41.360 --> 18:47.840
 space. It was simple, but it was really slow. I mean, if you applied a filter, I think it used

18:47.840 --> 18:52.400
 to take two or three seconds to render only eventually what I figure out how to do it on the

18:52.400 --> 18:58.720
 GPU. And I'm not even sure it was a GPU, but it was using OpenGL. But anyway, I would eventually

18:58.720 --> 19:03.040
 figure that out. And then it would be instant, but it used to be really slow. By the way,

19:03.040 --> 19:09.280
 anyone who's watching or listening, it's amazing what you can get away with in a startup,

19:09.280 --> 19:15.760
 as long as the product outcome is right for the user, like you can be slow, you can be terrible,

19:15.760 --> 19:22.080
 you can be as long as you have product market fit, people will put up with a lot. And then the

19:22.080 --> 19:27.760
 question is just about compressing, making it more performant over time so that they get that

19:27.760 --> 19:33.520
 product market fit instantly. So fascinating, because there's some things where those three

19:33.520 --> 19:39.920
 those three seconds would make or break the app. But some things you're saying not. It's hard to

19:39.920 --> 19:47.040
 know when, you know, it's what it's the problem Spotify solved, making streaming like work.

19:48.400 --> 19:54.240
 And like delays in listening to music is a huge negative, even like slight delays.

19:55.520 --> 20:00.800
 But here you're saying, I mean, how do you know when those three seconds are okay? Or you just

20:00.800 --> 20:08.960
 kind of have to try it out? Because to me, my intuition would be those three seconds would

20:08.960 --> 20:15.520
 kill the app. Like I would try to do the OpenGL thing. Right. So I wish I were that smart at the

20:15.520 --> 20:23.760
 time. I wasn't, I just knew how to do what I knew how to do, right? And I decided, okay, like, why

20:23.760 --> 20:32.080
 don't I just iterate over the values and change them? And what's interesting is that compared

20:32.080 --> 20:36.800
 to the alternatives, no one else used OpenGL. Right. So everyone else was doing that the dumb

20:36.800 --> 20:42.320
 way. And in fact, they were doing it at a high resolution. Now comes in the small resolution

20:42.320 --> 20:49.520
 that we'll talk about for a second. By choosing 512 pixels by 512 pixels, which I believe it was

20:49.520 --> 20:55.280
 at the time, we iterated over a lot fewer pixels than our competitors who were trying to do these

20:55.280 --> 21:02.320
 enormous output like images. So instead of taking 20 seconds, I mean, three seconds feels pretty good,

21:02.320 --> 21:08.320
 right? So on a relative basis, we were winning like a lot. Okay. So that's answer number one.

21:08.320 --> 21:13.600
 Answer number two is we actually focused on latency in the right places. So we did this

21:13.600 --> 21:20.720
 really wonderful thing when you uploaded. So the way it would work is, you know, you'd take your phone,

21:20.720 --> 21:26.720
 you'd take the photo, and then you'd go to the, you'd go to the edit screen, where you would

21:26.720 --> 21:32.320
 caption it. And on that caption screen, you'd start typing, you'd think, okay, like, what's a

21:32.320 --> 21:37.280
 clever caption? And I said to Mike, hey, when I worked on the Gmail team, you know what they did?

21:37.280 --> 21:42.080
 When you typed in your username or your email address, even before you've entered in your

21:42.080 --> 21:48.160
 password, like the chant probability, once you enter in your username that you're going to

21:48.160 --> 21:53.120
 actually sign in is extremely high. So when I just start loading your account in the background,

21:53.120 --> 21:59.760
 not not like sending it down to the desktop, that would be a security issue. But like,

21:59.760 --> 22:04.880
 load it into memory on the server, like get it ready, prepare it. I always thought that was so

22:04.880 --> 22:09.120
 fascinating and unintuitive. And I was like, Mike, why don't we just do that? But like,

22:09.120 --> 22:14.560
 we'll just upload the photo and like assume you're going to upload the photo. And if you don't,

22:15.200 --> 22:20.480
 forget about it, we'll delete it, right? So what ended up happening was people would caption their

22:21.280 --> 22:26.560
 photo, they'd press done or upload. And you'd see this little progress bar just go,

22:27.760 --> 22:34.800
 it was lightning fast. Okay, we were no faster than anyone else at the time. But by choosing 512

22:34.800 --> 22:40.160
 by 512 and doing in the background, it almost guaranteed that it was done by the time you

22:40.160 --> 22:47.120
 captioned. And everyone when they used it was like, how the hell is this thing so fast? But we

22:47.120 --> 22:52.080
 were slow, we just hit the slowness. It wasn't like, these things are just like it's a shelly game,

22:52.080 --> 23:00.080
 you're just hiding the latency. That that mattered to people like a lot. And I think that so you

23:00.080 --> 23:04.800
 were willing to put up with a slow filter, if it meant you could share it immediately. And of

23:04.800 --> 23:08.400
 course, we added sharing options with let which let you distribute it really quickly. That was

23:08.400 --> 23:17.520
 the third part. So latency matters, but relative to what? And then there's some like tricks,

23:17.520 --> 23:23.040
 you get around to just hiding the latency. Like, I don't know if Spotify starts downloading the

23:23.040 --> 23:29.200
 next song eagerly, I'm assuming they do. There are a bunch of ideas here that are not rocket science

23:29.200 --> 23:36.080
 that that really help. And all of that was stuff you were explicitly having a discussion about,

23:36.080 --> 23:40.240
 like those designs and argument, you were having like arguments, discussions.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.280
 I'm not sure it was arguments. I mean, I'm not sure if you've met my co founder Mike,

23:45.280 --> 23:51.120
 but he's a pretty nice guy. He's very reasonable. And we both just saw eye to eye and we're like,

23:51.120 --> 23:57.920
 yeah, just like, make this fast, early seem fast. It'll be great. I mean, honestly,

23:57.920 --> 24:05.680
 I think the most contentious thing and he would say this to initially was I was on an iPhone 3G,

24:05.680 --> 24:11.120
 so like the not so fast one, and he had a brand new iPhone 4. I was cheap. Nice.

24:12.400 --> 24:17.040
 And his fee loaded super smoothly, like when he would scroll from photo to photo,

24:18.640 --> 24:23.040
 buttery smooth, right? But on my phone, every time you got to a new photo, it was like,

24:23.040 --> 24:28.080
 kuchunk, kuchunk, allocate memory, like all this stuff, right? I was like, Mike, that's

24:28.080 --> 24:32.320
 unacceptable. And he's like, Oh, come on, man, just like upgrade your phone. Basically, you

24:32.320 --> 24:37.360
 didn't actually say that he's nicer than that. But I can tell he wished like I would just stop

24:37.360 --> 24:41.840
 being cheap and just get a new phone. But what's funny is we actually sat there working on that

24:41.840 --> 24:49.440
 little detail for a few days before launch. And that polished experience plus the fact that

24:49.440 --> 24:55.120
 uploading seemed fast for all these people who didn't have nice phones, I think meant a lot.

24:55.760 --> 25:02.720
 Because far too often you see teams focus not on performance, they focus on what's the cool

25:02.720 --> 25:08.400
 computer science problem they can solve, right? Can we scale this thing to a billion users? And

25:08.400 --> 25:15.040
 they've got like 100, right? Yeah. You talked about loss function. So I want to come back to that.

25:15.040 --> 25:20.960
 But like, the loss function is like, do you provide a great, happy, magical, whatever experience for

25:20.960 --> 25:26.320
 the consumer? And listen, if it happens to involve something complex and technical, then great.

25:26.960 --> 25:33.760
 But it turns out, I think most of the time, those experiences are just sitting there waiting to be

25:33.760 --> 25:39.680
 built with like, not that complex solutions. But everyone is just like so stuck in their

25:39.680 --> 25:43.520
 own head that they have to over engineer everything. And then they forget about the easy stuff.

25:43.520 --> 25:49.920
 I mean, also, maybe to flip the loss function there is you're trying to minimize the number of

25:49.920 --> 25:56.160
 times there's unpleasant experience, right? Like the one you mentioned where when you go to the

25:56.160 --> 26:00.880
 next photo, it freezes for a little bit. So it's almost as opposed to maximizing pleasure,

26:00.880 --> 26:07.040
 it's probably easier to minimize the number of like the friction. Yeah. And as we all know,

26:08.880 --> 26:12.000
 you just make the pleasure negative and then minimize everything. So

26:12.000 --> 26:16.240
 like we're mapping this all back to neural networks. But actually, can I say one thing on

26:16.240 --> 26:22.320
 that? Which is, I don't know a lot about machine learning, but I feel like I've tried studying a

26:22.320 --> 26:29.760
 bunch. That whole idea of reinforcement learning and planning out more than the greedy single

26:29.760 --> 26:37.440
 experience, I think is the closest you can get to like ideal product design thinking,

26:37.440 --> 26:42.720
 where you're not saying, hey, like, can we have a great experience just this one time? But like,

26:42.720 --> 26:48.560
 what is the right way to onboard someone? What series of experiences correlate most with them

26:48.560 --> 26:55.440
 hanging on long term, right? So not just saying, oh, did the photo load slowly a couple times or

26:55.440 --> 27:00.240
 did they get a great photo at the top of their feed? But like, what are the things that are going

27:00.240 --> 27:06.240
 to make this person come back over the next week, over the next month? And as a product designer,

27:06.240 --> 27:10.960
 asking yourself, okay, I want to optimize, not just minimize bad experiences in the short run,

27:10.960 --> 27:19.040
 but like, how do I get someone to engage over the next month? And I'm not going to claim that I

27:19.040 --> 27:23.040
 thought that way at all at the time, because I certainly didn't. But if I were going back and

27:23.040 --> 27:27.600
 giving myself any advice, it would be thinking, what are those, what are those second order effects

27:27.600 --> 27:34.080
 that you can create? And it turns out having your friends on the service is an enormous win. So

27:34.080 --> 27:38.560
 starting with a very small group of people that produce content that you wanted to see,

27:38.560 --> 27:44.960
 which we did, we seeded the community very well, I think, ended up mattering. And so.

27:44.960 --> 27:50.880
 Yeah, you said that community is one of the most important things. So it's from a metrics perspective,

27:50.880 --> 27:56.880
 from maybe a philosophy perspective, building a certain kind of community within the app. See,

27:56.880 --> 28:01.760
 I wasn't sure what exactly you meant by that when I've heard you say that. Maybe you can elaborate,

28:01.760 --> 28:08.800
 maybe you can elaborate. But as I understand now, it's can literally mean get your friends onto the

28:08.800 --> 28:16.880
 app. Yeah, think of it this way. You can build an amazing restaurant or bar or whatever, right?

28:17.760 --> 28:22.560
 But if you show up and you're the only one there, is it like, does it matter how good the food is?

28:23.840 --> 28:29.760
 The drinks, whatever. No, these are inherently social experiences that we were working on.

28:29.760 --> 28:36.720
 So the idea of having people there, like you needed to have that, otherwise,

28:37.520 --> 28:41.760
 it was just a filter app. But by the way, part of the genius, I'm going to say genius, even though

28:41.760 --> 28:50.240
 it wasn't really genius, was starting to be marauding as a filter app was awesome. The fact that you

28:50.240 --> 28:54.480
 could. So we talk about single player mode a lot, which is like, can you play the game alone?

28:54.480 --> 28:58.800
 And Instagram, you could totally play alone. You could filter your photos. And a lot of people would

28:58.800 --> 29:04.400
 tell me, I didn't even realize that this thing was a social network until my friends showed up.

29:04.400 --> 29:09.840
 It totally worked as a single player game. And then when your friends showed up, all of a sudden,

29:09.840 --> 29:15.440
 it was like, Oh, not only was this great alone, but now I actually have this trove of photos that

29:15.440 --> 29:21.680
 people can look at and start liking. And then I can like theirs. And so it was this bootstrap method

29:21.680 --> 29:26.640
 of how do you make the thing not suck when the restaurant is empty? Yeah, but the thing is,

29:26.640 --> 29:31.600
 when you say friends, we were not necessarily referring to friends in the physical space. So

29:31.600 --> 29:35.760
 you're not bringing your physical friends with you. You're also making new friends. So you're

29:35.760 --> 29:41.440
 finding new community. So it's not immediately obvious to me that it's like, it's almost like

29:41.440 --> 29:47.680
 building any kind of community. It was, it was both. And what we learned very early on was what

29:47.680 --> 29:51.840
 made Instagram special. And the reason why you would sign up for it versus say, just sit on

29:51.840 --> 29:56.800
 Facebook and look at your friends photos. Of course, we were live. And of course, it was

29:56.800 --> 30:01.280
 interesting to see what your friends were doing now. But the fact that you connect with people who

30:01.280 --> 30:05.920
 like took really beautiful photos in a certain style all around the world, whether they were

30:05.920 --> 30:11.600
 travelers, it was the beginning or beginning of the influencer economy is these people who became

30:11.600 --> 30:18.480
 professional Instagrammers way back when, right? But they took these amazing photos and some of

30:18.480 --> 30:24.880
 them were photographers, right? Like professionally. And all of a sudden you had this moment in the

30:24.880 --> 30:28.560
 day when you could open up this app and sure you could see what your friends were doing, but also

30:28.560 --> 30:32.880
 it was like, Oh my God, that's a beautiful, beautiful waterfall or Oh my God, I didn't realize

30:32.880 --> 30:39.280
 there was that corner of England or like really cool stuff. And the beauty about Instagram early

30:39.280 --> 30:46.480
 on was that it was international by default. You didn't have to speak English to use it, right?

30:46.480 --> 30:52.160
 Just look at the photos. Works great. We did translate. We had some pretty bad translations,

30:52.160 --> 30:58.400
 but we did translate the app. And, you know, even if our translations were pretty poor, the idea

30:58.400 --> 31:01.920
 that you could just connect with other people through their images was pretty powerful.

31:03.120 --> 31:08.160
 How much technical difficulties there with the programming, like what programming language

31:08.160 --> 31:13.360
 you were talking about, what was zero? Like maybe it was hard for us, but I mean, we,

31:15.200 --> 31:19.280
 there was nothing. The only thing that was complex about Instagram at the beginning

31:20.480 --> 31:27.040
 technically was making it scale. And we were just plain old Objective C for the client.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.680
 So it was iPhone only at first?

31:29.680 --> 31:30.800
 iPhone only, yep.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.520
 As an Android person, I'm deeply offended, but go ahead.

31:33.520 --> 31:38.960
 Come on. This was 2010. Oh, sure, sure. Sorry. Sorry. Android's gotten a lot better.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.680
 Yeah, yeah. I take it back, you're right.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.280
 If I were to do something today, I think it would be very different in terms of

31:45.280 --> 31:51.040
 launch strategy, right? Android's enormous, too. But anyway, back to that moment,

31:51.040 --> 31:59.360
 it was Objective C. And then we were Python based, which is just like, this is before Python was

31:59.360 --> 32:03.600
 really cool. Like now it's cool because it's all these machine learning libraries like support

32:03.600 --> 32:09.200
 Python and, right? Now it's super, now it's like cool to be Python. Back then it was like, oh,

32:09.200 --> 32:15.920
 Google uses Python. Like maybe you should use Python. Facebook was PHP. Like I had worked at

32:15.920 --> 32:20.880
 a small startup of some ex Googlers that used Python. So we used it and we used a framework

32:20.880 --> 32:27.520
 called Django. It still exists and people use for basically the back end. And then

32:27.520 --> 32:31.520
 you threw a couple of interesting things in there. I mean, we used Postgres, which was kind of fun.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.240
 It was a little bit like hipster database at the time, right?

32:34.240 --> 32:39.840
 MySQL. MySQL. Like everyone used MySQL. So like using Postgres was like an interesting decision,

32:39.840 --> 32:45.840
 right? But we used it because it had a bunch of geo features built in because we thought we were

32:45.840 --> 32:50.160
 going to be a check and app, remember? It's also super cool now. So you were into Python before

32:50.160 --> 32:54.960
 it was cool and you were into Postgres before it was cool. Yeah, we were basically like not only

32:54.960 --> 33:02.560
 hipster, hipster photo company, hipster tech company, right? We also adopted Redis early

33:02.560 --> 33:08.080
 and like loved it. I mean, it solved so many problems for us. And turns out that's still

33:08.080 --> 33:13.920
 pretty cool. But the programming was very easy. It was like, sign up a user, have a feed. There

33:13.920 --> 33:19.760
 was nothing, no machine learning at all, zero. Can you get some context? How many users at each

33:19.760 --> 33:25.520
 of these stages? We're talking about 100 users, a thousand users. So the stage I just described,

33:25.520 --> 33:33.440
 I mean, that technical stack lasted through probably 50 million users. I mean, seriously,

33:33.440 --> 33:40.160
 like you can get away with a lot with a pretty basic stack. Like I think a lot of startups try to

33:40.160 --> 33:44.720
 over engineer their solutions from the beginning to like really scale and you can get away with a

33:44.720 --> 33:50.000
 lot. That being said, most of the first two years of Instagram was literally just trying to make that

33:50.000 --> 33:56.800
 stack scale. And it wasn't, it was not a Python problem. It was like, literally just like, where

33:56.800 --> 34:01.600
 do we put the data? Like it's all coming in too fast. Like how do we store it? How do we make sure

34:01.600 --> 34:07.760
 to be up? How do we like, how do we make sure we're on the right size boxes that they have enough

34:07.760 --> 34:14.160
 memory? Those were the issues. But can you speak to the choices you make at that stage?

34:14.160 --> 34:19.440
 When you're growing so quickly, do you use something like somebody else's computer infrastructure?

34:20.320 --> 34:26.720
 Or do you build in house? I'm only laughing because we, when we launched, we had a single

34:27.440 --> 34:33.520
 computer that we had rented in some color space in LA, I don't remember what it was called.

34:34.480 --> 34:37.840
 Because I thought that's what you did when I worked at a company called Odio that became

34:37.840 --> 34:42.240
 Twitter. I remember visiting our space in San Francisco, you walked in, you had to wear the

34:42.240 --> 34:48.960
 ear things. It was cold and fans everywhere, right? And we had to, you know, plug one out,

34:48.960 --> 34:53.840
 replace one, and I was the intern. So I just like held things. But I thought to myself, oh,

34:53.840 --> 34:59.920
 this is how it goes. And then I remember being in a VC's office. I think it was Benchmark's office.

34:59.920 --> 35:03.600
 And I think we ran into another entrepreneur and they were like, oh, how are things going? We're

35:03.600 --> 35:09.280
 like, you know, try to scale this thing. And they were like, well, I mean, can't you just add more

35:09.280 --> 35:13.920
 instances? And I was like, what do you mean? And they're like instances on Amazon. I was like,

35:13.920 --> 35:19.680
 what are those? And it was this moment where we realized how deep in it we were, because we had

35:19.680 --> 35:26.800
 no idea that AWS existed, nor should we be using it. Anyway, that night, we went back to the office

35:26.800 --> 35:33.040
 and we got on AWS, but we did this really dumb thing. We're so sorry to people listening. But

35:33.040 --> 35:38.640
 we brought up an instance, which was our database. It's going to be a replacement for our database.

35:39.440 --> 35:44.960
 But we had it talking over the public internet to our little box in LA that was our app server.

35:44.960 --> 35:51.760
 Nice. Yeah. That's how sophisticated we were. And obviously, that was very, very slow. Didn't

35:51.760 --> 35:57.120
 work at all. I mean, it worked, but didn't work. Only like later that night did we realize we had

35:57.120 --> 36:01.520
 to have it all together. But at least like if you're listening right now and you're thinking,

36:01.520 --> 36:06.080
 you know, I have no chance, I'm going to start a stock, but I have no chance. I don't know. We

36:06.080 --> 36:10.720
 did it. We made a bunch of really dumb mistakes initially. I think the question is how quickly

36:10.720 --> 36:15.120
 do you learn that you're making a mistake? And do you do the right thing immediately right after?

36:15.120 --> 36:22.800
 So you didn't pay for those mistakes by failure. So yeah, how quickly did you fix it? I guess

36:22.800 --> 36:28.320
 there's a lot of ways to sneak up to this question of how do you scale the thing? Other startups,

36:28.320 --> 36:37.200
 if you have an idea, how do you scale the thing? Is it just AWS? And you try to write the kind of

36:37.200 --> 36:44.480
 code that's easy to spread across a large number of instances, and then the rest is just put money

36:44.480 --> 36:51.440
 into it? Basically, I would say a couple of things. First off, don't even ask the question.

36:51.440 --> 36:56.720
 Just find product market fit. Duck tape it together, right? Like if you have to. I think

36:56.720 --> 37:02.480
 there's a big caveat here, which I want to get to. But generally, all that matters is product

37:02.480 --> 37:09.120
 market fit. That's all that matters. If people like your product. Do not worry about when 50,000

37:09.120 --> 37:13.760
 people use your product because you will be happy that you have that problem when you get there.

37:13.760 --> 37:22.320
 I actually can't name many startups where they go from nothing to something overnight and they

37:22.320 --> 37:29.120
 can't figure out how to scale it. There are some, but I think nowadays it's a, when I say a solved

37:29.120 --> 37:35.440
 problem, like there are ways of solving it. The base case is typically that startups worry way

37:35.440 --> 37:39.760
 too much about scaling way too early and forget that they actually have to make something that

37:39.760 --> 37:46.880
 people like. That's the default mistake case. But what I'll say is once you start scaling,

37:46.880 --> 37:53.600
 I mean, hiring quickly, people who have seen the game before and just know how to do it, it becomes

37:55.600 --> 38:00.640
 a bit of like, yeah, just throw instances of the problem, right? But the last thing I'll say on this

38:00.640 --> 38:09.120
 that I think did save us. We were pretty rigorous about writing tests from the beginning. That helped

38:09.120 --> 38:15.200
 us move very, very quickly when we wanted to rewrite parts of the product and know that we

38:15.200 --> 38:19.920
 weren't breaking something else. Tests are one of those things where it's like, you go slow to go fast

38:20.560 --> 38:24.160
 and they suck when you have to write them because you have to figure it out and

38:25.360 --> 38:29.040
 there are always those ones that break when you don't want them to break and they're annoying and

38:29.040 --> 38:34.880
 it feels like you spend all this time. But looking back, I think that like long term optimal, even

38:34.880 --> 38:40.240
 with a team of four, it allowed us to move very, very quickly because anyone could touch any part

38:40.240 --> 38:45.840
 of the product and know that they weren't going to bring down the site, or at least in general.

38:45.840 --> 38:51.280
 At which point do you know product market fit? How many users would you say? Is it all it takes

38:51.280 --> 38:59.280
 us like 10 people or is it 1,000? Is it 50,000? I don't think it is generally a question of absolute

38:59.280 --> 39:04.080
 numbers. I think it's a question of cohorts and I think it's a question of trends. So,

39:04.080 --> 39:11.040
 you know, it depends how big your business is trying to be, right? But if I were signing up 1,000

39:11.040 --> 39:16.960
 people a week and they all retain like the retention curves for those cohorts looked good,

39:16.960 --> 39:23.360
 healthy, and even like as you started getting more people on the service, maybe those earlier cohorts

39:23.360 --> 39:26.800
 started curving up again because now there are network effects and their friends are on the

39:26.800 --> 39:34.080
 service or totally depends what type of business you're in. But I'm talking purely social, right? I

39:34.080 --> 39:39.600
 don't think it's an absolute number. I think it is a, I guess you could call it a marginal number.

39:39.600 --> 39:44.800
 So, I spent a lot of time when I worked with startups asking them like, okay, have you looked

39:44.800 --> 39:50.560
 at that cohort versus this cohort, whether it's your clients or whether it's people signing up for

39:50.560 --> 39:56.720
 the service. But a lot of people think you just have to hit some mark like 10,000 people or 50,000

39:56.720 --> 40:04.480
 people, but really 7ish billion people in the world. Most people forever will not know about your

40:04.480 --> 40:09.200
 product. There are always more people out there to sign up. It's just a question of how you turn

40:09.200 --> 40:16.800
 on the spigot. So, at that stage, early stage, yourself, but also by way of advice, should

40:16.800 --> 40:22.240
 you worry about money at all? How this thing is going to make money? Or do you just try to

40:22.240 --> 40:27.440
 find product market fit and get a lot of users to enjoy using your thing?

40:28.480 --> 40:34.960
 I think it totally depends and that's an unsatisfying answer. I was talking with a friend today who,

40:36.320 --> 40:40.720
 he was one of our earlier investors and he was saying, hey, have you been doing any angel

40:40.720 --> 40:44.800
 investing lately? I said, not really. I'm just focused on what I want to do next. And

40:44.800 --> 40:52.320
 he said the number of financings have just gone bonkers. People are throwing money everywhere

40:52.320 --> 41:01.680
 right now. And I think the question is, do you have an inkling of how you're going to make money?

41:02.720 --> 41:08.560
 Or are you really just waving your hands? I would not like to be an entrepreneur in the position

41:08.560 --> 41:14.960
 of, well, I have no idea how this will eventually make money. That's not fun.

41:16.960 --> 41:23.520
 If you are in an area like, let's say you wanted to start a social network, right? Not saying this

41:23.520 --> 41:28.160
 is a good idea, but if you did, there are only a handful of ways they've made money and really

41:28.160 --> 41:36.640
 only one way they've made money in the past and that's ads. So, if you have a service that's amenable

41:36.640 --> 41:40.800
 to that, and then I wouldn't worry too much about that because if you get to the scale,

41:40.800 --> 41:47.840
 you can hire some smart people and figure that out. I do think that it is really healthy for a

41:47.840 --> 41:53.840
 lot of startups these days, especially the ones doing enterprise software, slacks of the world,

41:53.840 --> 41:59.680
 et cetera, to be worried about money from the beginning, but mostly as a way of winning over

41:59.680 --> 42:07.360
 clients and having stickiness. Of course, you need to be worried about money, but I'm going to

42:07.360 --> 42:14.000
 also say this again, which is it's like long term profitability. If you have a roadmap to that,

42:14.000 --> 42:19.040
 then that's great. But if you're just like, I don't know, maybe never, working on this

42:19.040 --> 42:25.120
 metaverse thing, I think maybe someday, I don't know. That seems harder to me. So,

42:25.120 --> 42:30.480
 you have to be as big as Facebook to finance that bet, right? Do you think it's possible? You

42:30.480 --> 42:36.160
 said you're not saying it's necessarily a good idea to launch a social network. Do you think it's

42:36.160 --> 42:44.160
 possible today, maybe you can put yourself in those shoes, to launch a social network that

42:44.160 --> 42:51.200
 achieves the scale of a Facebook or a Twitter or an Instagram and maybe even greater scale?

42:51.200 --> 42:58.560
 Absolutely. How do you do it? Asking for a friend. Yeah, if I knew, I'd probably be doing it right

42:58.560 --> 43:04.720
 now and not sitting here. So, I mean, there's a lot of ways to ask this question. One is create a

43:04.720 --> 43:10.160
 totally new product, market fit, create a new market, create something like Instagram did,

43:10.160 --> 43:16.880
 which is like create something kind of new or literally outcompete Facebook at its own thing

43:16.880 --> 43:22.880
 or outcompete Twitter at its own thing. The only way to compete now if you want to build a large

43:22.880 --> 43:30.080
 social network is to look for the cracks, look for the openings. No one competed,

43:30.880 --> 43:35.200
 I mean, no one competed with the core business of Google. No one competed with the core business

43:35.200 --> 43:43.120
 of Microsoft. You don't go at the big guys doing exactly what they're doing. Instagram didn't win,

43:43.120 --> 43:49.840
 quote unquote, because it tried to be a visual Twitter. We spotted things that either Twitter

43:49.840 --> 43:56.640
 wasn't going to do or refused to do, images and feed for the longest time, right? Or that Facebook

43:56.640 --> 44:00.960
 wasn't doing or not paying attention to because they were mostly desktop at the time and we were

44:00.960 --> 44:08.160
 purely mobile, purely visual. Often there are opportunities sitting there. You just have to

44:08.160 --> 44:15.840
 figure out like, I think like there's a strategy book, I can't remember the name, but talk about

44:15.840 --> 44:22.160
 motes and just like the best place to play is where your competitor like literally can't pivot

44:22.160 --> 44:29.040
 because structurally they're set up not to be there. And that's where you win. And what's

44:29.040 --> 44:34.400
 fascinating is like, do you know how many people were like, images, Facebook does that, Twitter

44:34.400 --> 44:38.480
 does that. I mean, how wrong were they? Really wrong. And these are some of the smartest people

44:38.480 --> 44:44.480
 in Silicon Valley, right? But now Instagram exists for a while. How is it that Snapchat could then

44:44.480 --> 44:50.240
 exist? Makes no sense. Like plenty of people would say, well, there's Facebook, no images. Okay,

44:50.240 --> 44:55.120
 okay. I mean, Instagram, I'll give you that one. But wait, now another image based social network

44:55.120 --> 45:02.240
 is going to get really big. And then TikTok comes along. Like the prior, so you asked me,

45:02.240 --> 45:08.560
 is it possible? The only reason I'm answering yes is because my prior is that it's happened

45:08.560 --> 45:14.080
 once every, I don't know, three, four or five years consistently. And I can't imagine there's

45:14.080 --> 45:19.600
 anything structurally that would change that. So that's why I answer that way. Not because I know

45:19.600 --> 45:24.560
 how I just, when you see a pattern, you see a pattern and there's no reason to believe that's

45:24.560 --> 45:30.160
 going to stop. And it's subtle too. Because like you said, Snapchat and TikTok, they're all doing

45:30.160 --> 45:36.720
 the same space of things. But there's something fundamentally different about like a three

45:36.720 --> 45:41.600
 second video and a five second video and a 15 second video and a one minute video and a one hour

45:41.600 --> 45:47.200
 video, like fundamentally different. Fundamentally different. I mean, I think one of the reasons

45:47.200 --> 45:53.280
 Snapchat exists is because Instagram was so focused on posting great, beautiful, manicured

45:54.080 --> 45:58.960
 versions of yourself throughout time. And there was this enormous demand of like, hey,

45:58.960 --> 46:05.120
 I really like this behavior. I love using Instagram. But man, I just wish I could share

46:05.120 --> 46:10.880
 something going on in my day. Do I really have to put it on my profile? Do I really have to make

46:10.880 --> 46:16.960
 it last forever? Do I really? And that opened up a door. It created a market, right? And then

46:16.960 --> 46:22.160
 what's fascinating is Instagram had an Explorer page for the longest time. It was image driven,

46:22.160 --> 46:27.600
 right? But there's absolutely a behavior where you open up Instagram and you sit on the Explorer

46:27.600 --> 46:32.880
 page all day. That is effectively TikTok, but obviously focused on videos. And it's not like

46:32.880 --> 46:38.240
 you could just put the Explorer page in TikTok form and it works. It had to be video, it had to

46:38.240 --> 46:44.320
 have music. These are the hard parts about product development that are very hard to predict. But

46:46.000 --> 46:51.360
 they're all versions of the same thing with varying. If you line them up in a bunch of

46:51.360 --> 46:56.800
 dimensions, they're just like kind of on, they're different values of the same dimensions,

46:56.800 --> 47:02.400
 which is, I guess, easy to say in retrospect. But if I were an entrepreneur going after that area,

47:02.400 --> 47:07.520
 I'd ask myself, where's the opening? What needs to exist because TikTok exists now?

47:08.400 --> 47:15.760
 So I wonder how much things that don't yet exist and can exist is in the space of algorithms,

47:15.760 --> 47:21.520
 in the space of recommender systems, so in the space of how the feed is generated.

47:21.520 --> 47:27.760
 So we kind of talk about the actual elements of the content. That's what we've been talking,

47:27.760 --> 47:34.000
 the difference between photos, between short videos, longer videos. I wonder how much disruption

47:34.000 --> 47:39.040
 it's possible in the way the algorithms work. Because a lot of the criticism towards social

47:39.040 --> 47:45.200
 media is in the way the algorithms work currently. And it feels like, first of all, talking about

47:45.200 --> 47:55.760
 product market fit, there's certainly a hunger for social media algorithms that do something

47:55.760 --> 48:02.000
 different. I don't think anyone, everyone's complaining, this is not doing, this is hurting

48:02.000 --> 48:08.400
 me and this is hurting society. But I keep doing it because I'm addicted to it. And they say,

48:08.400 --> 48:15.600
 we want something different, but we don't know what. It feels like just different. It feels

48:15.600 --> 48:20.320
 like there's a hunger for that. But that's in the space of algorithms. I wonder if it's possible

48:20.320 --> 48:28.800
 to disrupt in that space. Absolutely. I have this thesis that the worst part about social networks

48:28.800 --> 48:37.440
 is that there is the people. It's a line that sounds funny, right? Because that's why you're

48:37.440 --> 48:44.880
 called a social network. But what does social networks actually do for you? Just think, imagine

48:44.880 --> 48:49.280
 you're an alien and you landed and someone says, hey, there's this site. It's a social network.

48:49.280 --> 48:53.040
 We're not going to tell you what it is, but what does it do? And you have to explain it to them.

48:53.040 --> 49:01.840
 Just two things. One is that people you know and have social ties with distribute updates

49:01.840 --> 49:08.000
 through whether it's photos or videos about their lives so that you don't have to physically be with

49:08.000 --> 49:12.320
 them, but you can keep in touch with them. That's one. That's like a big part of Instagram. That's

49:12.320 --> 49:19.280
 a big part of Snap. It is not part of TikTok at all. So there's another big part, which is there's

49:19.280 --> 49:24.560
 all this content out in the world that's entertaining, whether you want to watch it or you want to read

49:24.560 --> 49:33.280
 it and matchmaking between content that exists in the world and people that want that content.

49:33.280 --> 49:37.200
 It turns out to be a really big business. Search and discovery, would you?

49:37.200 --> 49:41.440
 Search and discovery. But my point is it could be video, it could be text, it could be websites,

49:41.440 --> 49:52.480
 it could be, I mean, think back to dig or stumble upon. But what did those do? They basically

49:52.480 --> 50:01.120
 distributed interesting content to you. I think the most interesting part or the future of social

50:01.120 --> 50:06.240
 networks is going to be making them less social because I think people are part of the root cause

50:06.240 --> 50:11.360
 of the problem. So for instance, often in recommender systems, we talk about two stages.

50:11.360 --> 50:16.480
 There's a candidate generation step, which is just like of our vast trove of stuff that you

50:16.480 --> 50:25.440
 might want to see. What small subset should we pick for you? Typically, that is grabbed from

50:25.440 --> 50:31.360
 things your friends have shared. Then there's a ranking step, which says, okay, now given these

50:31.360 --> 50:37.520
 100, 200 things, depends on the network, let's be really good about ranking them and generally

50:37.520 --> 50:41.760
 rank the things up higher that get the most engagement. So what's the problem with that?

50:41.760 --> 50:47.120
 Step one is we've limited everything you could possibly see to things that your friends have

50:47.120 --> 50:53.280
 chosen to share, or maybe not friends, but influencers. What things do people generally

50:53.280 --> 50:56.640
 want to share? They want to share things that are going to get likes, that are going to show up

50:56.640 --> 51:02.880
 broadly. So they tend to be more emotionally driven. They tend to be more risque or whatever.

51:02.880 --> 51:08.800
 So why do we have this problem? It's because we show people things people have decided to share

51:08.800 --> 51:14.640
 and those things self select to being the things that are most divisive. So how do you fix that?

51:15.680 --> 51:21.600
 Well, what if you just imagine for a second that why do you have to grab things from things

51:21.600 --> 51:26.560
 your friends have shared? Why not just like grab things? That's really fascinating to me.

51:26.560 --> 51:32.320
 And that's something I've been thinking a lot about. And just like, why is it that when you

51:32.320 --> 51:39.120
 log on to Twitter, you're just sitting there looking at things from accounts that you've

51:39.120 --> 51:44.640
 followed for whatever reason? And TikTok, I think, has done a wonderful job here, which is like,

51:44.640 --> 51:51.840
 you can literally be anyone. And if you produce something fascinating, it'll go viral. But like,

51:52.720 --> 51:57.040
 you don't have to be someone that anyone knows. You don't have to have built up a giant following.

51:57.040 --> 52:01.600
 You don't have to have paid for followers. You don't have to try to maintain those followers.

52:01.600 --> 52:05.920
 You literally just have to produce something interesting. That is, I think, the future

52:05.920 --> 52:11.520
 of social networking. That's the direction things will head. And I think what you'll find is,

52:11.520 --> 52:17.440
 it's far less about people manipulating distribution and far more about what is like,

52:17.440 --> 52:23.760
 is this content good? And good is obviously a vague definition that we spend hours on. But

52:25.280 --> 52:29.440
 different networks, I think, will decide different value functions to decide what is good and what

52:29.440 --> 52:33.200
 isn't good. And I think that's a fascinating direction. So that's almost like creating an

52:33.200 --> 52:40.240
 internet. I mean, that's what Google did for web pages. They did page rank search. So discovery,

52:40.240 --> 52:46.160
 you don't follow anybody on Google when you use a search engine. You just discover web pages.

52:46.160 --> 52:54.720
 And so what TikTok does is saying, let's start from scratch. Let's start a new internet and have

52:54.720 --> 53:00.720
 people discover stuff on that new internet within a particular pool of people. But what's so fascinating

53:00.720 --> 53:08.240
 about this is the field of information retrieval. I always talked about, as I was studying this stuff,

53:08.240 --> 53:12.320
 I would always use the word query and document. So I was like, why are they saying query and

53:12.320 --> 53:18.640
 document? They're literally like, if you just stop thinking about query as literally a search query,

53:18.640 --> 53:23.440
 and a query could be a person. I mean, a lot of the way, I'm not going to claim to know how Instagram

53:23.440 --> 53:30.160
 or Facebook machine learning works today. But if you want to find a match for a query,

53:30.160 --> 53:35.600
 the query is actually the attributes of the person, their age, their gender, where they're from,

53:36.640 --> 53:42.560
 maybe some kind of summarization of their interests. And that's a query. And that matches

53:42.560 --> 53:47.440
 against documents. And by the way, documents don't have to be text. They can be videos. They're

53:47.440 --> 53:51.200
 however long. I don't know what the limit is on TikTok these days. They keep changing it.

53:51.200 --> 53:55.760
 My point is just, you've got a query, which is someone in search of something that

53:55.760 --> 54:00.560
 they want to match, and you've got the document, and it doesn't have to be text, it could be anything.

54:00.560 --> 54:04.960
 And how do you match make? And that's one of these like, I mean, I've spent a lot of time

54:04.960 --> 54:10.080
 thinking about this, and I don't claim to have mastered it at all. But I think it's so fascinating

54:10.080 --> 54:16.080
 about where that will go with new social networks. See, what I'm also fascinated by is metrics that

54:16.080 --> 54:21.840
 are different than engagement. So the other thing from an alien perspective, what social networks

54:21.840 --> 54:30.560
 are doing is they, they in the short term, bring out different aspects of each human being. So

54:30.560 --> 54:40.960
 first, let me say that an algorithm or a social network for each individual can bring out the best

54:40.960 --> 54:45.520
 of that person or the worst of that person, or there's a bunch of different parts to us,

54:45.520 --> 54:52.160
 parts we're proud of, that we are, parts we're not so proud of. When we look at the big picture

54:52.160 --> 54:57.440
 of our lives, when we look back 30 days from now, am I proud that I said those things or not?

54:57.440 --> 55:03.760
 Am I proud that I felt those things? Am I proud that I experienced or read those things or thought

55:03.760 --> 55:10.080
 about those things? Just in that kind of self reflected kind of way. And so coupled with that,

55:10.080 --> 55:14.080
 I wonder if it's possible to have different metrics that are not just about engagement,

55:14.080 --> 55:21.440
 but are about long term happiness, growth of a human being, where they look back and say,

55:22.160 --> 55:28.640
 I'm a better human being for having spent 100 hours on that app. And that feels like it's

55:28.640 --> 55:34.640
 actually strongly correlated with engagement in the long term. In the short term, it may not be,

55:34.640 --> 55:39.600
 but in the long term, it's like the same kind of thing where you really fall in love with the

55:39.600 --> 55:44.560
 product. You fall in love with an iPhone, you fall in love with a car. That's what makes you fall

55:44.560 --> 55:53.520
 in love is really being proud in a self reflective way, understanding that you're a better human being

55:53.520 --> 55:59.520
 for having used the thing. And that's what great relationships are made from. It's not just like

56:00.080 --> 56:06.000
 you're hot and we like being together or something like that. It's more like I'm a better human being

56:06.000 --> 56:11.840
 because I'm with you. And that feels like a metric that could be optimized for by the algorithms.

56:12.960 --> 56:18.720
 But anytime I kind of talk about this with anybody, they seem to say, yeah, okay, that's

56:18.720 --> 56:24.000
 going to get outcompeted immediately by the engagement if it's ad driven, especially.

56:24.560 --> 56:30.080
 I just don't think so. I mean, a lot of it is just implementation.

56:30.080 --> 56:37.440
 I'll say a couple of things. One is to pull back the curtain on daily meetings inside of these

56:37.440 --> 56:44.480
 large social media companies. A lot of what management or at least the people that are

56:44.480 --> 56:49.520
 tweaking these algorithms spend their time on are trade offs. And there's these things called value

56:49.520 --> 56:55.360
 functions, which are like, okay, we can predict the probability that you'll click on this thing

56:55.360 --> 57:01.040
 or the probability that you'll share it or the probability that you will leave a comment on it

57:01.040 --> 57:09.520
 or the probability you'll dwell on it. Individual actions. And you've got this neural network that

57:09.520 --> 57:14.720
 basically has a bunch of heads at the end and all of them are between zero and one and great,

57:14.720 --> 57:20.640
 they all have values or they all have probabilities. And then in these meetings,

57:20.640 --> 57:27.760
 what they will do is say, well, how much do we value a comment versus a click versus a share

57:27.760 --> 57:33.600
 versus a, and then maybe even some downstream thing that has nothing to do with the item

57:33.600 --> 57:40.000
 there but like driving follows or something. And what typically happens is they will say,

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
 well, what are our goals for this quarter at the company? Oh, we want to drive sharing up.

57:44.000 --> 57:50.960
 Okay, well, let's turn down these metrics and turn up these metrics. And they blend them into a

57:50.960 --> 57:58.000
 single scalar with which they're trying to optimize. That is really hard. Because invariably,

57:58.000 --> 58:01.520
 you think you're solving for, I don't know, something called meaningful interactions.

58:02.560 --> 58:07.440
 This was the big Facebook pivot. And I don't actually have any internal knowledge. I wasn't

58:07.440 --> 58:14.800
 in those meetings. But at least from what we've seen over the last month or so, it seems by actually

58:14.800 --> 58:20.080
 trying to optimize for meaningful interactions. It had all these side effects of optimizing for

58:20.080 --> 58:25.360
 these other things. And I don't claim to fully understand them. But what I will say

58:26.320 --> 58:32.320
 is that tradeoffs abound. And as much as you'd like to solve for one thing, if you have a network

58:32.320 --> 58:37.120
 of over a billion people, you're going to have unintended consequences either way. And it gets

58:37.120 --> 58:43.280
 really hard. So what you're describing is effectively a value model that says, can we capture,

58:43.280 --> 58:50.000
 this is the thing that I spent a lot of time thinking about, can you capture utility in a

58:50.000 --> 58:57.040
 way that actually measures someone's happiness that isn't just a, what do they call it, a surrogate

58:57.040 --> 59:03.120
 problem where you say, well, I think the more you use the product, the happier you are. That was

59:03.120 --> 59:07.920
 always the argument at Facebook, by the way. It was like, well, people use it more so they must be

59:07.920 --> 59:12.160
 more happy. Turns out there are like a lot of things you use more that make you less happy in

59:12.160 --> 59:17.120
 the world, not talking about Facebook, just, you know, let's think about whether it's gambling or

59:17.120 --> 59:21.440
 whatever, like that you can do more of, but doesn't necessarily make you happier. So the idea that

59:21.440 --> 59:27.120
 time equals happiness, obviously, you can't map utility and time together easily. There are a

59:27.120 --> 59:31.440
 lot of edge cases. So when you look around the world and you say, well, what are all the ways

59:31.440 --> 59:36.160
 we can model utility? There's like one of the, please, if you know someone's smart doing this,

59:36.160 --> 59:42.240
 introduce me because I'm fascinated by it. And it seems really tough. But the idea that reinforcement

59:42.240 --> 59:47.600
 learning, like everyone interesting, I know, in machine learning, like I was really interested

59:47.600 --> 59:52.960
 in recommender systems and supervised learning. And the more I dug into it, I was like, oh,

59:52.960 --> 59:57.520
 literally everyone's smart is working on reinforcement learning, like literally everyone.

59:57.520 --> 1:00:00.640
 You just made people at OpenAI and DeepMind very happy, yes.

1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:05.600
 But I mean, but what's interesting is like, it's one thing to train a game. And like,

1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:11.120
 I mean, that paper that where they just took Atari and they used a ConvNet to basically

1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:17.120
 just like train simple actions, mind blowing, right? Absolutely mind blowing. But it's a game,

1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:27.440
 great. So now what if you're constructing a feed for a person, right? Like, how can you construct

1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:35.200
 that feed in such a way that optimizes for a diversity of experience, a long term happiness,

1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:40.320
 right? But that reward function, it turns out in reinforcement learning again,

1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:48.640
 as I've learned, like reward design is really hard. And I don't know, like, how do you design a

1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:53.120
 scalar reward for someone's happiness over time? I mean, do you have to measure dopamine levels?

1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:57.920
 Like, do you have to? Well, you have to have a lot of a lot more signals

1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:03.280
 from the human being currently feels like there's not enough signals coming from the human being

1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:09.280
 users of of this algorithm. So for reinforcement learning to work well, you need to have a lot

1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:13.680
 more data needs to have a lot of data. And that actually is a challenge for anyone who wants to

1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:18.560
 start something, which is you don't have a lot of data. So how do you compete? But I do think

1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:24.480
 back to your original point, rethinking the algorithm, rethinking reward functions, rethinking

1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:31.120
 utility. That's fascinating. That's cool. And I think that's an open opportunity for

1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:38.640
 our company that figures it out. I have to ask about April 2012, when Instagram,

1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:46.480
 along with its massive employee base of 13 people, was sold to Facebook for $1 billion.

1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:52.560
 What was the process like on a business level, engineering level, human level? What was that

1:01:52.560 --> 1:01:58.000
 process of selling to Facebook like? What did it feel like? So I want to provide some context,

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:02.480
 which is I worked in corporate development at Google, which not a lot of people know,

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:06.880
 but corporate development is effectively the group that buys companies, right? You sit there and

1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:11.920
 you acquire companies. And I had sat through so many of these meetings with entrepreneurs.

1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:15.280
 We actually, fun fact, we never acquired a single company when I worked in corporate

1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:22.880
 development. So I can't claim that I had a lot of experience. But I had enough experience to

1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:29.920
 understand, okay, what prices are people getting and what's the process? And as we started to grow,

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:36.400
 we were trying to keep this thing running and we were exhausted and we were 13 people. And I mean,

1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:47.440
 we were trying to think back, it's probably 27, 37 now. So young and on a relative basis, right?

1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:53.200
 And we're trying to keep the thing running. And then, you know, we go out to raise money and

1:02:54.560 --> 1:03:00.320
 we're kind of like the hot startup at the time. And I remember going into a specific VC and saying,

1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:04.240
 our terms we're looking for are, we're looking for a $500 million valuation.

1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:10.880
 And I've never seen so many jobs drop all in unison, right? And I was like,

1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:17.600
 thanked and walked out the door very kindly after. And then I got a call the next day from someone

1:03:17.600 --> 1:03:22.080
 who was connected to them and said, they said, we just want to let you know that like, it was

1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:28.560
 pretty offensive that you asked for $500 million valuation. And I can't tell if that was like,

1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:33.600
 just negotiating or what, but it's true, like no one offered us more, right? So we were,

1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:39.920
 so can you clarify the number again? We said, how many million 500 500 million 500 million. Yeah,

1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:45.600
 half a billion. Yeah. So in my mind, I'm anchored like, okay, well, literally no one's

1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:52.000
 biting at 500 million. And eventually we would get Sequoia and Greylock and others together at 500

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:59.440
 million, basically, post it was 450 pre, I think we raised $50 million. But just like no one was

1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:04.480
 used to seeing 500 million dollar companies then like, I don't know if it was because we were

1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:13.600
 just coming out of the hangover 2008 and things were still on recovery mode. But then along comes

1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:20.960
 Facebook. And after some negotiation, we've two X to the number from a half a billion to a billion.

1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:28.640
 Yeah, it seems pretty good. You know, and I think Mark and I really saw eye to eye that this

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:34.080
 thing could be big. We thought we could, their resources would help us scale it. And in a lot

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:39.280
 of ways it de risks. I mean, it's a lot of the employees lives for the rest of their lives,

1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:44.640
 including me, including Mike, right? I think I might have had like 10 grand in my bank account

1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:50.880
 at the time, right? Like, we're working hard. We had nothing. So on a relative basis, it seems

1:04:51.520 --> 1:04:56.640
 very high. And then I think the last company to exit for anywhere close to a billion was YouTube

1:04:56.640 --> 1:05:03.840
 that I could think of. And, and thus began the giant long bull run of 2012 to all the way,

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:09.680
 all the way to where we are now where I saw some stat yesterday about like how many unicorns exist

1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:16.960
 and it's absurd. But then again, never underestimate technology and like the value it can provide and

1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:23.040
 man costs have dropped and man scale has increased. And you can make businesses make a lot of money

1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:30.320
 now. But on a fundamental level, I don't know, like how do you describe the decision to sell

1:05:30.320 --> 1:05:36.400
 a company with 13 people for a billion dollars? So first of all, like how do you take a lot of

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:42.720
 guts to set a table and say 500 million or 1 billion with Mark Zuckerberg? It seems like a

1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:49.760
 very large number with 13. Like, especially like, it doesn't seem it is, they're all large, especially

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:56.720
 like you said, before the unicorn parade. I like that. I'm going to use that.

1:05:56.720 --> 1:06:01.600
 The unicorn parade. Yeah, the the you were at the head of the unicorn parade.

1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:05.360
 It's the yeah, it's a massive unicorn parade. Okay, so

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:13.600
 no, I mean, we knew we were worth, quote unquote, a lot, but we didn't, I mean, there was no market

1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:17.040
 for Instagram. I mean, it's not you couldn't marked, you couldn't mark to market this thing

1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:22.080
 in the public markets, you didn't quite understand what it would be worth or was worth at the time.

1:06:22.880 --> 1:06:26.880
 So in a market, an illiquid market where you have one buyer and one seller and you're going back

1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:33.680
 and forth. And well, I guess there were like VC firms who were willing to, you know, invest at

1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:40.480
 a certain valuation. So I don't know, you just go with your gut. And, and at the end of the day,

1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:52.000
 I would say the hardest part of it was not realizing, like when we sold, it was tough,

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:59.040
 because like literally everywhere I go, restaurants, whatever, like, for a good six months after,

1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:03.920
 it was a lot of attention on the deal, a lot of attention on the product, a lot of attention.

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:08.480
 And it was kind of miserable, right? And you're like, wait, like I made a lot of money, but like,

1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:14.880
 why is this not great? And it's because it turns out, you know, and I don't, I don't know, like

1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:18.480
 I don't really keep in touch with Mark, but I've got to assume his job right now is not exactly

1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:22.640
 the most happy job in the world. It's really tough when you're on top. And it's really tough

1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:27.520
 when you're in the limelight. So the decision itself was like, Oh, cool, this is great. How

1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:32.480
 lucky are we? Right? So okay, there's a million questions. Yeah, go first of all, first of all,

1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:41.520
 why? Why is it hard to be on top? Why did you not feel good? Like, can you dig into that? It always,

1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:50.240
 I've heard like Olympic athletes say, after they win gold, they get depressed. Is it something like

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:57.680
 that where it feels like it was kind of like a thing you were working towards? Yeah, some loose

1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:03.440
 definition of success. And this shows like feels like at least according to other startups, this

1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:09.600
 is what success looks like. And now, why don't I feel any better? I'm still human. I still have

1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:13.760
 all the same problems. Is that the nature? Or is it just like negative attention or some kind?

1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:19.200
 I think it's all of the above. But to be clear, there was a lot of happiness in terms of like,

1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:27.600
 oh, my God, this is great. Like we like won the Super Bowl of startups, right? Anyone who can get to

1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:32.880
 a liquidity event of anything meaningful feels like, wow, this is what we started out to do. Of

1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:38.800
 course, we want to create great things that people love. But like we won in a big way. But yeah,

1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:45.760
 there's this big like, Oh, if we won, what is like, what's next? I don't. So they call it that we have

1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:53.120
 a Rive syndrome, which I need to go back and look where I can quote that from. But I remember

1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:57.440
 reading about it at the time, I was like, Oh, yeah, that's that. And I remember we had a product

1:08:57.440 --> 1:09:02.800
 manager leave very early on when we got to Facebook. And he said to me, I just don't believe I can

1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:10.240
 learn anything at this company anymore. It's like it's hit its apex. We sold it great. I just don't

1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:17.120
 have anything else to learn. So from 2012, all the way to the day I left in 2018, like the amount I

1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:23.360
 learned and the humility with which I realized, Oh, we thought we won. Billion dollars is cool.

1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:27.440
 But like, there are a hundred billion dollar companies. And by the way, on top of that,

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:32.720
 we had no revenue. We had, I mean, we had a cool product, but we didn't scale it yet. And

1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:38.800
 there's so much to learn. And then competitors and how fun was it to fight Snapchat? Oh my God,

1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:44.160
 like it was like Yankees red socks. It's great. Like that's what you live for.

1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:51.200
 You know, you win some, you lose some, but the amount you can learn through that process.

1:09:52.480 --> 1:09:58.480
 What I've realized in life is that there is no and there's always someone who has more,

1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:04.800
 there's always more challenge, just at different scales. And it sounds like a little Buddhist,

1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:12.160
 but everything is super challenging, whether you're like a small business or an enormous business.

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:18.320
 I say like, choose the game you like to play, right? You've got to imagine that if you're an

1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:23.280
 amazing basketball player, you enjoy, to some extent, practicing basketball. It's got to be

1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:27.120
 something you love. It's going to suck. It's going to be hard. You're going to have injuries,

1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:30.720
 right? But you got to love it. And the same thing with Instagram, which is

1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:38.000
 we might have sold, but it was like, great, there's one Super Bowl title. Can we win five?

1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:44.560
 What else can we do? Now I imagine you didn't ask this, but okay, so I left. There's a little bit

1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:49.600
 of like, what do you do next? Right? Like, what do you, how do you top that thing? It's the wrong

1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:54.640
 question. The question is like, when you wake up every day, what is the hardest, most interesting

1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:59.200
 thing you can go work on? Because like, at the end of the day, we all turn into dirt,

1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:05.360
 doesn't matter, right? But what does matter is like, can we really enjoy this life?

1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:10.000
 Not in a hedonistic way, because that's those, it's like the reinforcement learning, learning

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:16.800
 like short term versus long term objectives. Can you wake up every day and truly enjoy what you're

1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:24.000
 doing, knowing that it's going to be painful, knowing that like, no matter what you choose,

1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:29.280
 it's going to be painful. Whether you sit on a beach or whether you manage a thousand people or

1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:35.600
 10,000, it's going to be painful. So choose something that's fun to have pain. But yes,

1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:44.320
 there was a lot of, we have arrived and it's a maturation process. You just have to go through.

1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:49.360
 So no matter how much success there is, how much money you make, you have to wake up the next day

1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:54.960
 and choose the hard life, whatever that means next. That's fun. The fun slash hard life.

1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:00.240
 Hard life, that's fun. I guess what I'm trying to say is slightly different,

1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:07.600
 which is just that no one realizes everything's going to be hard. Even chilling out is hard.

1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:10.880
 And then you just start worrying about stupid stuff. Like, I don't know, like,

1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:16.320
 did so and so forget to paint the house today? Or like, did the gardener come or whatever? Like,

1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:21.040
 or, oh, I'm so angry and my shipment of wine didn't show up and I'm sitting here on the beach

1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:25.760
 without my wine. I don't know, I'm making shit up now. But like, it turns out that even chilling

1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:30.960
 aka meditation is hard work. Yeah. And at least meditation is like productive chilling where

1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:35.440
 you're like actually training yourself to calm down and beat. But backing up for a moment,

1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:42.080
 everything's hard. You might as well be like playing the game you love to play. I just like

1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:50.400
 playing and winning. And I'm still on the, I think, the first half of life knock on wood.

1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:56.080
 And I've got a lot of years and what am I going to do? Sit around? And the other way of looking

1:12:56.080 --> 1:13:03.680
 at this, by the way, imagine you made one movie and it was great. Would you just like stop making

1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:09.520
 movies? No. Generally, you're like, wow, I really like making movies. Let's make another one. A lot

1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:13.120
 of times, by the way, the second one or the third one, not that great, but the fourth one, awesome.

1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:17.440
 And no one forgets the second or everyone forgets the second and the third one.

1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:24.320
 So there's just this constant process of like, can I produce? And is that fun? Is that exciting?

1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:29.520
 What else can I learn? So this machine learning stuff for me has been this awesome new chapter

1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:34.960
 of being like, man, that's something I didn't understand at all. And now I feel like I'm one

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:41.520
 tenth of the way there. And that feels like a big mountain to climb. So I distracted us from the

1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:45.280
 original question. No, when we'll return to the machine learning, because I'd love to explore

1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:50.960
 your interest there. But I mean, speaking of sort of challenges and hard things, is there a possible

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:59.120
 world where sitting in a room with Mark Zuckerberg, with a $1 billion deal, you turn it down?

1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:05.520
 Yeah, of course. What does that world look like? Why would you turn it down? Why did you take it?

1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:11.520
 What was the calculation that you were making? Thus enters the world of counterfactuals and

1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:17.040
 not really knowing. And if only we could run that experiment. Well, the universe exists. It's just

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:23.920
 running in parallel to our own. Yeah. It's so fascinating, right? I mean, we're talking a lot

1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:31.680
 about money. But the real question was, I'm not sure you'll believe me when I say this, but could

1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:38.240
 we strap our little company onto the side of a rocket ship and get out to a lot of people

1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:45.280
 really, really quickly with the support, with the talent of a place like Facebook? I mean,

1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:50.000
 people often ask me what I would do differently at Instagram today. And I say, well, I'd probably

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:55.360
 hire more carefully because we showed up just like before I knew it. We had like 100 people on the

1:14:55.360 --> 1:15:00.000
 team and 200, then 300. I don't know where all these people were coming from. I never had to

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:05.280
 recruit them. I never had to screen them. They were just like internal transfers, right? So it's

1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:10.640
 like relying on the Facebook hiring machine, which is quite sort of, I mean, it's an elaborate

1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:16.480
 machine. It's great, by the way. They have really talented people there. But my point is

1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:23.840
 the choice was like, take this thing, put it on the side of a rocket ship that you know is growing

1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:30.160
 very quickly. Like I had seen what had happened when Ev sold Blogger to Google, and then Google

1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:36.000
 went public. Remember, we sold before Facebook went public. There was a moment at which the

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:41.200
 stock price was $17, by the way. Facebook stock price was $17. I remember thinking, what the

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:51.920
 the fuck did I just do? Now at $320, I don't know where we are today, but like, okay. The

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:57.440
 best thing, by the way, is when the stock is down, everyone calls you dope. And then when it's up,

1:15:57.440 --> 1:16:02.400
 they also call you a dope, but just for a different reason, right? You can't win.

1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:07.760
 Less than in there somewhere. But the choice is to strap yourself to a rocket ship or to build

1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:14.720
 your own. You know, Mr. Elon built his own, literally, with a rocket ship. That's a difficult

1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:21.200
 choice because there's a world. Actually, I would say something different, which is Elon and others

1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:27.040
 decided to sell PayPal for not that much. I mean, how much was it about a billion dollars? I can't

1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:31.440
 remember. Something like that. Yeah. I mean, it was early, but it's worth a lot more now.

1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:37.200
 To then build a new rocket ship. So this is the cool part, right? If you are an entrepreneur,

1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:42.560
 and you own a controlling stake in the company, not only is it really hard to do something else

1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:49.680
 with your life, because all of the value is tied up in you as a personality attached to this company,

1:16:49.680 --> 1:16:54.960
 right? But if you sell it and you get yourself enough capital and you have enough energy,

1:16:55.680 --> 1:16:59.840
 you could do another thing or 10 other things, or in Elon's case, like a bunch of other things.

1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:06.160
 I don't know. I lost count at this point. And it might have seemed silly at the time. And sure,

1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:12.400
 like if you look back, man, PayPal is worth a lot now, right? But I don't know. Do you think Elon

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:21.280
 cares about, are we going to buy Pinterest or not? He created a massive capital that allowed

1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:25.360
 him to do what he wants to do. And that's awesome. That's more freeing than anything,

1:17:25.360 --> 1:17:29.600
 because when you are an entrepreneur attached to a company, you got to stay at that company for a

1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:34.400
 really long time. It's really hard to remove yourself. But I'm not sure how much he loved

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:40.720
 PayPal versus SpaceX and Tesla. I have a sense that you love Instagram.

1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:44.880
 Yeah, I loved enough to work for six years beyond the deal.

1:17:44.880 --> 1:17:47.360
 Which is rare, which is very rare. You chose.

1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:55.200
 But can I tell you why? There are not a lot of companies that you can be part of where

1:17:56.160 --> 1:18:00.720
 the Pope's like, I would like to sign up for your product. I'm not a religious person at all.

1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:06.960
 I'm really not. But when you go to the Vatican and you're walking among the giant columns and

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:11.280
 you're hearing the music and everything, and the Pope walks in and he wants to press the

1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:16.640
 sign up button on your product, it's a moment in life. No matter what your persuasion.

1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:24.880
 The number of doors and experiences that that opened up was incredible. The people I got to

1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:31.360
 meet, the places I got to go, I assume maybe a payments company is slightly different, right?

1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:38.400
 But that's why it was so fun. Plus, I truly believed we were building such a great product,

1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:42.880
 and I loved the game. It wasn't about money. It was about the game.

1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:51.280
 Do you think you had the guts to say no? I often think about this. How hard is it for an

1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:58.160
 entrepreneur to say no? Because the peer pressure, basically the sea of entrepreneurs in Silicon

1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:05.040
 Valley are going to tell you, this is their dream. The thing you were sitting before was a dream.

1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:13.360
 To walk away from that is really, it seems like nearly impossible. Because Instagram could,

1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:20.640
 in 10 years, you could talk about Google. You could be making self driving cars and building

1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:26.800
 rockets that go to Mars and compete with SpaceX. Totally. That's an interesting decision to say,

1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:34.720
 am I willing to risk it? The reason I also say it's an interesting decision, because

1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:41.120
 it feels like, per our previous discussion, if you're launching a social network company,

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:47.280
 there's going to be that meeting, whatever that number is, if you're successful. If you're on

1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:52.800
 this rocket ship of success, there's going to be a meeting with one of the social media social

1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:59.040
 network companies that want to buy you, whether it's Facebook or Twitter, but it could also very

1:19:59.040 --> 1:20:10.560
 well be Google who seems to have a graveyard of failed social networks. I think about that,

1:20:10.560 --> 1:20:15.040
 how difficult it is for an entrepreneur to make that decision. How many have successfully made

1:20:15.040 --> 1:20:21.120
 that decision, I guess. This is a big question. It's sad to me, to be honest, that too many make

1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:25.920
 that decision perhaps for the wrong reason. Sorry, when you say make the decision, you mean to the

1:20:25.920 --> 1:20:30.400
 affirmative. To the affirmative, yeah. You got it. Yeah. There are also companies that don't sell

1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:36.160
 and take the path and say, we're going to be independent, and then you've never heard of

1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:44.640
 that again. I remember Path was one of our competitors early on. There's a big moment

1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:49.760
 when they had, I can't remember what it was, $110 million offer from Google or something.

1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:56.480
 It might have been larger. I don't know. I remember there was this big TechCrunch article

1:20:56.480 --> 1:21:04.000
 that was like, they turned it down after talking deeply about their values and everything. I don't

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:09.040
 know the inner workings of Foursquare, but I'm certain there were many conversations over time

1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:14.880
 where there were companies that wanted Foursquare as well. Recently, what other companies,

1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:21.920
 there's Clubhouse. I don't know. Maybe people were really interested in them, too. There are

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:28.720
 plenty of moments where people say no, and we just forget that those things happen. We only

1:21:28.720 --> 1:21:36.560
 focus on the ones where they said yes and like, wow, what if they had stayed independent? I don't

1:21:36.560 --> 1:21:42.880
 know. I used to think a lot about this. Now, I just don't because I'm like, whatever. Things

1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:50.720
 have gone pretty well. I'm ready for the next game. Think about an athlete where, I don't know,

1:21:50.720 --> 1:21:55.200
 maybe they do something wrong in the World Series or whatever. I'm like, if you let it

1:21:55.200 --> 1:22:00.240
 haunt you for the rest of your career, why not just be like, I don't know, it was a game.

1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:07.360
 Next game. Next shot. If you just move to that world, at least I have a next shot, right?

1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:12.960
 No, that's beautiful. I mean, just insights. It's funny you brought up Clubhouse. It is

1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:20.560
 very true. It seems like Clubhouse is on the downward path, and it's very possible to see

1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:27.840
 a billion plus dollar deal at some stage, maybe like a year ago or half a year ago from Facebook,

1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:33.280
 from Google. I think Facebook was flirting with that idea too, and I think a lot of companies

1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:41.120
 probably were. I wish it was more public. You know what? There's not like a badass public story

1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:45.760
 about them making the decision to walk away. We just don't hear about it, and then we get to see

1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:52.160
 the results of that success or the failure more often failure. So a couple of things. One is,

1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:56.000
 I would not assume Clubhouse is down for the count at all. They're young. They have plenty

1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:02.160
 of money. They're run by really smart people. I'd give them a very fighting chance to figure it

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:05.520
 out. There are a lot of times when people call Twitter down for the count and they figure it

1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:10.640
 out, and they seem to be doing well, right? So just backing up and not knowing anything

1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:16.400
 about their internals, there's a strong chance they will figure it out and that people are just

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:19.920
 down because they like being down about companies. They like assuming that they're going to fail.

1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:23.920
 So who knows, right? But let's take the ones in the past where we know how it played out.

1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:29.200
 There are plenty of examples where people have turned down big offers and then you've just never

1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:34.000
 heard from them again. But we never focus on the companies because you just forget that those were

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:43.040
 big. But inside your psyche, I think it's easy for someone with enough money to say money doesn't

1:23:43.040 --> 1:23:50.000
 matter, which I think is bullshit. Of course, money matters to people. But at the moment,

1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:54.880
 you just can't even grasp the number of zeros that you're talking about. It just doesn't make sense,

1:23:55.600 --> 1:24:01.280
 right? So to think rationally in that moment is not something many people are equipped to do,

1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:05.840
 especially not people where I think we had founded the company a year earlier, maybe

1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:13.200
 two years earlier, like a year and a half, we were 13 people. But I will say, I still don't know

1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:17.280
 if it was the right decision because I don't have that counterfactual. I don't know that other world.

1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:24.480
 Yeah. I'm just thankful that by and large, most people love Instagram still do. By and large,

1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:31.120
 people are very happy with the time we had there. And I'm proud of what we built. So I'm cool.

1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:40.240
 Now it's next shot, right? Well, if we could just linger on this Yankees versus Red Sox,

1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:47.440
 the fun of it, the competition over, I would say, over the space of features. So there are a bunch

1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:56.000
 of features, like there's photos, there's one minute videos on Instagram, there's IGTV, there's

1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:02.480
 stories, there's reels, there's live. So that sounds like it's like a long list of too much

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:08.640
 stuff. But it's not because it feels like they're close together. But there's somehow,

1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:12.000
 like we were saying, fundamentally distinct, like each of the things I mentioned.

1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:17.760
 Maybe can you describe the philosophies, the design philosophies behind some of these,

1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:24.720
 how you were thinking about it during the historic war between Snapchat and Instagram,

1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:30.080
 or just in general, like the space of features that was discovered?

1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:37.040
 There's this great book by Clay Christensen called Competing Against Luck. It's like a terrible

1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:45.120
 title. But within it, there's effectively an expression of this thing called jobs to be done

1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:50.960
 theory. And it's unclear if he came up with it or some of his colleagues, but there are a bunch

1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:54.320
 of places you can find with people claiming to have come up with this jobs to be done theory.

1:25:54.880 --> 1:26:01.600
 But the idea is if you zoom out and you look at your product, you ask yourself,

1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:08.320
 why are people hiring your product? Imagine every product in your life is effectively an employee,

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:14.720
 your CEO of your life, and you hire products to be employees effectively. They all have roles and

1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:20.720
 jobs. Why are you hiring a product? Why do you want that product to perform something in your

1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:27.600
 life? What are the hidden reasons why you're in love with this product? Instagram was about

1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:33.360
 sharing your life with others visually, period. Why? Because you feel connected with them,

1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:43.280
 you get to show off, you get to feel good and cared about with likes. And it turns out that

1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:51.280
 that will, I think, forever define Instagram and any product that serves that job is going to do

1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:59.920
 very well. Stories, let's take it as an example, is very much serving that job. In fact, it serves

1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:04.560
 it better than the original product because when you're large and have an enormous audience,

1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:09.760
 you're worried about people seeing your stuff or you're worried about being permanent so that a

1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:15.200
 college admissions person is going to see your photo of you doing something. And so it turns out

1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:20.080
 that that is a more efficient way of performing that job than the original product was. The original

1:27:20.080 --> 1:27:25.680
 product still has its value, but at scale, these two things together work really, really well.

1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:32.720
 Now, I will claim that other parts of the product over time didn't perform that job as well. I

1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:40.400
 think IGTV probably didn't. Shopping is completely unrelated to what I just described, but in my

1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:48.720
 work, I don't know. Products that succeed are products that all share this parent node

1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:53.920
 of this job to be done that is in common, and then they're just different ways of doing it.

1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:59.520
 Apple, I think, does a great job with this. It's like managing your digital life,

1:27:59.520 --> 1:28:07.040
 and all the products just work together. They sync. It's beautiful, even if they require

1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:14.080
 silly specific chords to work, but they're all part of a system. It's when you leave that system

1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:18.400
 and you start doing something weird that people start scratching their head, and I think you are

1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:22.880
 less successful. I think one of the challenges Facebook has had throughout its life is that it

1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:28.800
 has never fully, I think, appreciated the job to be done of the main product, and what it's done is

1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:33.600
 said, ooh, there's a shiny object over there. That starps getting some traction. Let's go copy that

1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:38.720
 thing. Then they're confused why it doesn't work. Why doesn't it work? It's because the people who

1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:44.800
 show up for this don't want that. It's different. What's the purpose of Facebook? I remember I

1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:50.880
 was a very early Facebook user. The reason I was personally excited about Facebook is

1:28:52.240 --> 1:29:00.080
 because you can, first of all, use your real name. I can exist in this world. It can be formally

1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:06.400
 exist. I like anonymity for certain things, Reddit and so on, but I wanted to also exist

1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:13.520
 not anonymously so that I can connect with other friends of mine, not anonymously,

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:19.520
 and there's a reliable way to know that I'm real and they're real and that we're connecting.

1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:30.800
 I liked it for the reasons that people linked in, I guess, but not everybody is dressed up

1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:37.440
 and being super polite, more like with friends. Then it became something much bigger than that,

1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:47.760
 I suppose. There's a feed. It became a place to discover content,

1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:53.840
 to share content that's not just about connecting directly with friends. I mean,

1:29:53.840 --> 1:29:58.880
 it became something else. I don't even know what it is really. You said Instagram is a place where

1:29:58.880 --> 1:30:06.160
 you visually share your life. What is Facebook? Let's go back to the founding of Facebook and

1:30:06.160 --> 1:30:11.920
 why it worked really well initially at Harvard and then Dartmouth and Stanford. I can't remember.

1:30:11.920 --> 1:30:19.120
 Probably MIT. There were a handful of schools in that first trunche. It worked because there are

1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:24.640
 communities that exist in the world that want to transact. When I say transact, I don't mean

1:30:24.640 --> 1:30:29.520
 commercially. I just mean they want to share. They want to coordinate. They want to communicate.

1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:37.360
 They want to space for themselves. Facebook at its best, I think, is that. If actually you

1:30:37.360 --> 1:30:43.040
 look at the most popular products that Facebook has built over time, if you look at things like

1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:50.240
 groups and marketplace, groups is enormous. Groups is effectively like everyone can found

1:30:50.240 --> 1:30:56.960
 their own little Stanford or Dartmouth or MIT and find each other and share and communicate

1:30:56.960 --> 1:31:03.840
 about something that matters deeply to them. That is the core of what Facebook was built around.

1:31:03.840 --> 1:31:12.720
 I think today is where it stands most strongly. Yeah, it's brilliant. The groups, I wish groups

1:31:12.720 --> 1:31:18.400
 were done better. It feels like it's not a first class citizen. I know I may be saying something

1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:26.080
 without much knowledge, but it feels like it's bolted on while being used a lot.

1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:30.160
 It feels like there needs to be a little bit more structure in terms of discovery.

1:31:32.720 --> 1:31:38.480
 I mean, look at Reddit. Reddit is basically groups of public and open and a little bit crazy

1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:44.800
 in a good way. But there's clear product market fit for that specific use case,

1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:48.320
 and it doesn't have to be a college. It can be anything. It can be a small group, a big group.

1:31:48.320 --> 1:31:54.240
 It can be group messaging. Facebook shines, I think, when it leans into that. I think when

1:31:54.240 --> 1:32:01.520
 there are other companies that just seem exciting, and now all of a sudden the product shifts in some

1:32:01.520 --> 1:32:07.280
 fundamental way to go try to compete with that other thing, that's when I think consumers get

1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:12.960
 confused. Even if you can be successful, even if you can compete with that other company,

1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:17.680
 even if you can figure out how to bolt it on, eventually you come back and you look at the

1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:23.040
 app and you're like, I just don't know why I opened this app. There are too many things going on,

1:32:23.040 --> 1:32:26.640
 and that was always a worry. I mean, you listed all the things at Instagram, and that almost

1:32:26.640 --> 1:32:31.760
 gave me a heart attack. Way too many things, but I don't know. Entrepreneurs get bored.

1:32:31.760 --> 1:32:38.080
 They want to add things. They want it right. I don't have a good answer for it, except for that,

1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:43.120
 I think, being true to your original use case, and not even original use case, but

1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:48.480
 sorry, actually not use case, original job. There are many use cases under that job.

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:55.680
 Being true to that and being really good at it over time and morphing as needs change,

1:32:57.040 --> 1:33:04.480
 I think that's how to make a company last forever. Honestly, my main thesis about why

1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:12.720
 Facebook is in the position it is today is if they have had a series of product launches

1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:19.680
 that delighted people over time, I think they'd be in a totally different world. Just imagine

1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:24.800
 for a moment, and by the way, Apple's entering this, but Apple for so long, just product after

1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:29.280
 product, you couldn't wait for it. You stood in line for it. You talked about it. You got excited.

1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:35.280
 Amazon makes your life so easy. It's like, wow, I needed this thing, and it showed up at my door

1:33:35.280 --> 1:33:41.680
 two days later, and both of these companies, by the way, Amazon, Apple have issues. There are

1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:47.200
 labor issues, whether it's here in the US or in China. There are environmental issues.

1:33:48.160 --> 1:33:53.840
 But when's the last time you heard a large chorus being like, these companies better pay

1:33:53.840 --> 1:34:00.320
 for what they're doing on these things, right? I think Facebook's main issue today is you need

1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:06.480
 to produce a hit. If you don't produce hits, it's really hard to keep consumers on your side.

1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:11.120
 Then people just start picking on you for a variety of reasons, whether it's right or wrong.

1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:14.240
 I'm not even going to place a judgment right here and right now. I'm just going to say that

1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:20.640
 it is way better to be in a world where you are producing hits and consumers love what you're

1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:28.000
 doing because then they're on your side. I think that it's the past 10 years for Facebook has been

1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:33.360
 fairly hard on this dimension. And by hits, it doesn't necessarily mean financial hits. It feels

1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:38.640
 like to me what you're saying is something that brings joy, a product that brings joy to some

1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:44.240
 fraction of the population. Yeah. I mean, TikTok isn't just literally an algorithm.

1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:53.200
 In some ways, TikTok's content and algorithm have more sway now over the American psyche

1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:58.960
 than Facebook's algorithm. It's visual, it's video. By the way, it's not defined by who you

1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:02.960
 follow. It's defined by some magical thing that, by the way, if someone wanted to tweak to show you

1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:09.520
 a certain type of content for some reason, they could. People love it.

1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:15.040
 So as a CEO, let me ask you a question because leadership matters.

1:35:17.520 --> 1:35:22.240
 This is a complicated question. Why is Mark Zuckerberg distrusted,

1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:26.640
 disliked, and sometimes even hated by many people in public?

1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:33.760
 Right. That is a complicated question. Well, the premise, I'm not sure I agree with the premise.

1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:41.440
 And I can expand that to include even a more mysterious question for me, Bill Gates.

1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:48.480
 What is the Bill Gates version of the question? Do you think people hate Bill Gates?

1:35:48.480 --> 1:36:00.880
 No, distrust. So take away one. It's a checklist. I think Mark Zuckerberg's distrust is the primary

1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:08.400
 one, but there's also a dislike. Maybe hate is too strong a word, but just if you look at the

1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:16.080
 articles that are being written and so on, there's a dislike. It's confusing to me because

1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:22.080
 it's like the public picks certain individuals and they attach certain kinds of emotions to those

1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:29.920
 individuals. Yeah. So someone just recently said, there's a strong case that founder led

1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:36.320
 companies have this problem and that a lot of Mark's issues today come from the fact that he

1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:43.440
 is a visible founder with this story that people have watched in both a movie and they followed

1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:49.200
 along and he's this boy wonder kid who became one of the world's richest people. And he's no

1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:54.800
 longer Mark the person. He's marked this image of a person with enormous wealth and power.

1:36:55.520 --> 1:37:02.240
 And in today's world, we have issues with enormous wealth and power for a variety of reasons. One

1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:09.200
 of which is we've been stuck inside for a year and a half, two years. One of which is a lot of

1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:14.080
 people were really unhappy about not the last election, but the last, last election. And where

1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:19.760
 do you take out that anger? Who do you blame but the people in charge? That's one example or one

1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:30.080
 reason why I think a lot of people express anger, resentment or unhappiness with Mark. At the same

1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:35.360
 time, I don't know, I pointed out to that person, I was like, well, I don't know. I think a lot of

1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:41.520
 people really like Elon. Like, Elon arguably, like he kept his factory open here throughout

1:37:41.520 --> 1:37:49.760
 COVID protocols, which arguably a lot of people would be against. While saying a bunch of crazy,

1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:55.760
 offensive things on the internet, they still like basically, you know, gives the middle finger to

1:37:55.760 --> 1:38:00.880
 the SEC like on Twitter and like, I don't know. I'm like, well, there's a founder and like,

1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:10.400
 people kind of like him. So I do think that the founder and slash CEO of a company that's a social

1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:16.160
 network company is like an extra level of difficulty. If life is a video game, you just chose the

1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:20.800
 harder video game. So I mean, that's why it's interesting to ask you because you were the

1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:28.000
 founder and CEO of a social network. I challenge it because exactly. But you're one of the rare

1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:36.400
 examples, even Jack Dorsey's this light, not to the degree, but it just seems harder when you're

1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:41.600
 running a social media company. It's interesting. I never thought of Jack as just like, I think

1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:49.600
 generally, he's well respected. Yeah, I think so. I think you're right. But like, he's not loved.

1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:55.920
 Yeah. And I feel like you, I mean, to me, Twitter is an incredible thing. Yeah. Again,

1:38:55.920 --> 1:39:01.200
 can I just come back to this point, which seems oversimplistic, but like, I really do think

1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:07.200
 how a product makes someone feel they ascribe that feeling to the founder.

1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:14.640
 So, so make people feel good. So think about it. Like, let's just go with this thesis first.

1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:20.800
 Sure. I like it though. Amazon's pretty utilitarian, right? It delivers brown boxes to

1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:26.240
 your front door. Sure, you can have Alexa and you can have all these things, right? But in general,

1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:33.520
 it delivers stuff quickly to you at a reasonable price, right? I think Jeff Bezos is wonderfully

1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:38.800
 wealthy, thoughtful, smart guy, right? But like, people kind of feel that way about them. They're

1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:44.000
 like, wow, this is really big. We're impressed that this is really big. And, but he's doing the

1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:48.640
 same space stuff Elon's doing, but they don't necessarily ascribe the same sense of wonder,

1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:54.000
 right? Now, let's take Elon. And again, this is pet theory. I don't have much proof other

1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:02.000
 than my own intuition. He is literally about living the future. Mars. It's about wonder. It's

1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:05.760
 about going back to that feeling as a kid when you looked up to the stars and asked,

1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:12.800
 is there life out there? People get behind that because it's a sense of hope and excitement and

1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:19.280
 innovation. And like, you can say whatever you want, but we ascribe that emotion to that person. Now,

1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:23.920
 let's say you're on a social network and people make you kind of angry because they disagree with

1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:28.720
 you or they say something ridiculous or they're living a FOMO type life where you're like, wow,

1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:35.120
 I wish I was doing that thing. I think Instagram, if I were to think back, by and large, when I was

1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:40.960
 there was not about FOMO, was not about this influencer economy, although it certainly became

1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:46.720
 that way closer to the end. It was about the sense of wonder and happiness and beautiful things in

1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:50.880
 the world. And I don't know. I mean, like, I don't want to have a blind spot, but I don't think

1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:54.880
 anyone had a strong opinion about FOMO or the other. For the longest time, the way people

1:40:54.880 --> 1:40:59.520
 explained to me, I mean, if you want to go for toxicity, you go to Facebook or Twitter. If you

1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:04.320
 want to go to make feel good about life, you go to Instagram to enjoy, celebrate life though.

1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:08.240
 And my experience when talking to people is they gave me the benefit of the doubt because of that.

1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:12.480
 But if your experience of the product is kind of makes you angry, it's where you argue.

1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:18.000
 I mean, a big part of Jack might be that he wasn't actually the CEO for a very long time and only

1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:25.440
 became recently. So I'm not sure how much of the connection got made. But in general, I mean, if you

1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:30.960
 hate, you know, I'm just thinking about other companies that are in tech companies, if you

1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:37.200
 hate like what a company is doing or it makes you not feel happy, I don't know, like people are

1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:41.520
 really angry about Comcast or whatever. Are they even called Comcast anymore? It's like Xfinity or

1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:48.000
 something, right? They had to rebrand. They became meta, right? It's like, but my point is if it

1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:55.360
 makes you angry. That's beautiful. Yeah. But the thing is, this is me saying this, I think your

1:41:55.360 --> 1:42:04.000
 thesis is very strong and correct, has elements of correctness, but I still personally put some

1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:11.360
 blame on individuals. Of course. I think you said, Elon looking up, there's something about

1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:18.880
 childlike wander to him, like to his personality, his character, something about, I think more so

1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:24.320
 than others, where people can trust them. And there's, I don't know, Sunder Prachai is an example

1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:30.560
 of somebody who's like, there's some, it's hard to put into words, but there's something about

1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:38.320
 the human being, where he's trustworthy. Yeah. He's human in a way that connects to us. And the

1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:47.360
 same with Sajin Adela, I mean, some of these folks, something about us is drawn to them,

1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:52.960
 even when they're flawed, even like, so like your thesis really holds up for Steve Jobs,

1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:58.080
 because I think people didn't like Steve Jobs, but like he delivered products that and then they

1:42:58.080 --> 1:43:04.640
 fell in love every time. I guess you could say that the CEO, the leader is also a product.

1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:10.240
 And if they keep delivering a product that people like, by being a public and saying

1:43:10.240 --> 1:43:15.600
 things that people like, that's also a way to make people happy. But from a social network

1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:21.520
 perspective, it makes me wonder how difficult it is to explain to people why certain things

1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:32.320
 happen, like to explain machine learning, to explain why certain the woke mob effect happens,

1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:39.840
 or the certain kinds of like bullying happens, which is like, it's human nature combined with

1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:44.560
 algorithm, and it's very difficult to control for how the spread of quote unquote misinformation

1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:50.400
 happens. It's very difficult to control for that. And so you try to decelerate certain parts and

1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:55.840
 you create more problems than you solve. And anything that looks at all like censorship can

1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:01.200
 create huge amounts of problems as it's liberty slope. And then you have to inject humans to

1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:05.360
 oversee the machine learning algorithms. And anytime you inject humans into the system,

1:44:05.360 --> 1:44:09.360
 it's gonna create a huge number of problems. And I feel like it's up to the leader to communicate

1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:15.040
 that effectively to be transparent. First of all, design products that don't have those problems.

1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:19.520
 And second of all, when they have those problems, to be able to communicate with them, I guess that's

1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:27.360
 all going to when you run a social network company, your job is hard. Yeah, I will say the one element

1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:32.960
 that you haven't named that I think you're getting at is just bedside manner, which Steve Jobs,

1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:42.720
 I never worked for him, I never met him in person, had an like an uncanny ability in public to have

1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:47.520
 bedside manner. I mean, some of the best clips of Steve Jobs from like, I would say,

1:44:47.520 --> 1:44:53.440
 maybe the 80s when he's on these stage and getting questions from the audience about life for,

1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:58.960
 and he'll take this question that is like, how are you going to compete with blah? And it's super

1:44:58.960 --> 1:45:03.680
 boring. And I don't even know the name of the company. And his answer is, is if you would just

1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:08.800
 ask like your grandfather, the meaning of life. Yeah. And you sit there and you're just like,

1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:14.880
 what? Like, and there's that bedside manner. And if you lack that, or if that's just not

1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:21.920
 intuitive to you, I think that it can be a lot harder to gain the trust of people and then add

1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:28.480
 on top of that, missteps of companies, right? It's, I don't know if you have any friends from

1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:33.520
 the past where like, maybe they crossed you once or like, maybe you get back together and your

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:38.720
 friends again, but you just never really forget that thing. It's human nature not to forget.

1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:46.000
 I'm Russian. You crossed me once. We solve the problem. So my point is, there is,

1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:51.520
 humans don't forget. And if there are times in the past where they feel like they don't trust

1:45:51.520 --> 1:45:56.960
 the company or the company hasn't had their back, that is really hard to earn back,

1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:01.840
 especially if you don't have that bedside manner. And again, like, I'm not attributing this

1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:09.120
 specifically to Mark because I think a lot of companies have this issue where one, you have

1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:13.280
 to be trustworthy as a company and live by it and live by those actions. And then two,

1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:18.640
 I think you need to be able to be really relatable in a way that's very difficult if you're worth

1:46:18.640 --> 1:46:24.640
 like what these people are. It's really hard. Yeah. Jack does a pretty good job of this

1:46:24.640 --> 1:46:31.440
 by being a monk. But I also like Jack issues attention. Like he's not out there almost on

1:46:31.440 --> 1:46:36.960
 purpose. He's just working hard, doing square and right. I literally shared a desk like this

1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:42.400
 with him at Odio. I mean, this normal guy who likes painting. I remember he would leave

1:46:42.400 --> 1:46:48.640
 early on like Wednesdays or something to go to like a painting class. And he's creative. He's

1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:54.000
 thoughtful. I mean, money makes people like more creative and more thoughtful, like extreme versions

1:46:54.000 --> 1:47:00.560
 of themselves, right? And this was a long, long time ago. You mentioned that he asked you to do

1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:06.080
 some kind of JavaScript thing. We were working on some JavaScript together. That's hilarious.

1:47:06.080 --> 1:47:11.600
 Like pre Twitter, early Twitter days, you and Jack Dorsey are in a room together talking about

1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:16.480
 JavaScript, solving some kind of menial problem. Terrible problems. Yeah. I mean, not terrible,

1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:20.560
 just like boring, boring widget problem. I think it was the Odio widget we were working on at the

1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:25.760
 time. I'm surprised anyone paid me to be in the room as an intern because I didn't really provide

1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:32.480
 any value. I'm very thankful to anyone who included me back in the day. It was very helpful. So thank

1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:39.680
 you for listening. I mean, is there Odio that's a precursor to Twitter? First of all, did you have

1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:45.280
 any anticipation that this Jack Dorsey guy could be also head of a major social network?

1:47:45.280 --> 1:47:52.480
 And second, did you learn anything from the guy that like, do you think it's a coincidence that

1:47:52.480 --> 1:48:00.480
 you two were in the room together? And it's the coincidence, meaning like, why does the world play

1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:05.360
 its game in a certain way where these two founders of social networks? I don't know. It's so weird,

1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:13.360
 right? Like, I mean, it's also weird that Mark showed up, you know, in our fraternity, my sophomore

1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:20.720
 year, and we got to know each other then like long before Instagram, it's, it's a small world. But

1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:28.480
 let me tell a fun story about Jack. We're at Odio. And I don't know, I think Ev was feeling like

1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:35.840
 people weren't working hard enough or something. And I can't remember exactly what he created this

1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:42.080
 thing where every Friday, I don't know if it was every Friday, I only remember this happening once.

1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:51.120
 But he had us like a statuette. It's like of Mary. And in the bottom, it's hollow, right? And I

1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:57.440
 remember on a Friday, he decided he was going to let everyone vote for who had worked the hardest

1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:03.280
 that week. We all voted closed ballot, right? We all put in a bucket. And he tallied the votes.

1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:10.400
 And then whoever got the most votes, as I recall, got the statuette. And in the statuette was a

1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:14.480
 thousand bucks. Or as I recall, there was a thousand bucks. It might have been a hundred bucks,

1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:18.080
 but let's call it a thousand. It's more exciting that way. It felt like a thousand. It did to me

1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:22.480
 for sure. I actually got two votes. I was very happy. We were a small company, but as the intern,

1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:26.560
 I got at least two votes. So everybody knew how many votes they got individually? Yeah. Yeah. And

1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:30.960
 I think it was one of these self accountability things. Anyway, I remember Jack just getting like

1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:37.360
 the vast majority of votes from everyone. And I remember just thinking like, like, I couldn't

1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:42.640
 imagine he would become what he'd become and do what he would do. But I had a profound respect that

1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:50.880
 the new guy who I really liked worked that hard. And you could see his dedication, even that,

1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:55.920
 and that people respected him. That's the one story that I remember of him, like working with him

1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:59.920
 specifically from that summer. Can take a small tangent on that. Of course. There's kind of a

1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:06.880
 pushback in Silicon Valley a little bit against hard work. Can you speak to the sort of the

1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:12.640
 thing you admired to see the new guy working so hard, that thing? What is the value of that thing

1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:20.320
 in a company? See, this is like, just to be very frank, it drives me nuts. I saw this really funny

1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:25.040
 video on TikTok. Was it on TikTok? It was like, I'm taking a break from my mental health to work

1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:32.080
 on my career. I thought that was funny. So it's like, oh, it is kind of phrased that way the opposite

1:50:32.080 --> 1:50:43.600
 often, right? Okay, so a couple of things. I have worked so hard to do the things that I did,

1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:50.720
 like Mike and I lost years off of our lives, staying up late, figuring things out, the stress

1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:55.520
 that comes with the job. I have a lot more gray hair now than I did back then. It requires an

1:50:55.520 --> 1:51:00.480
 enormous amount of work. And most people aren't successful, right? But even the ones that do

1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:08.240
 don't skate by. I am okay if people choose not to work hard, because I don't actually think

1:51:08.240 --> 1:51:14.160
 there's anything in this world that says you have to work hard. But I do think that great

1:51:14.160 --> 1:51:18.800
 things require a lot of hard work. So there's no way you can expect to change the world without

1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:24.320
 working really hard. And by the way, even changing the world, the folks that I respect the most have

1:51:24.320 --> 1:51:33.280
 nudged the world in a slight direction, slight, very, very slight. Even if Elon accomplishes

1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:38.320
 all the things he wants to accomplish, we will have nudged the world in a slight direction.

1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:42.240
 But it requires enormous amount. There was an interview with him where he was just like,

1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:47.760
 he was interviewed, I think, at the Tesla factory, and he was like, work is really hard. This is

1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:53.600
 actually unhealthy. And I can't recall the exact, but he was visibly shaken about how hard he had

1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:57.520
 been working. And he was like, this is bad. And unfortunately, I think to have great outcomes,

1:51:57.520 --> 1:52:02.320
 you actually do need to work at three standard deviations above the mean. But there's nothing

1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:06.320
 saying that people have to go for that. See, the thing is, but what I would argue,

1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:10.320
 this is my personal opinion, is nobody has to do anything first of all. Exactly.

1:52:10.320 --> 1:52:17.600
 They certainly don't have to work hard. Exactly. But I think hard work in a company should be

1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:27.520
 admired. I do too. And you should not feel like you shouldn't feel good about yourself or not

1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:35.040
 working hard. So for example, I don't have to work out. I don't have to run. I hate running.

1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:40.640
 But I certainly don't feel good if I don't run because I know for my health, there's certain

1:52:40.640 --> 1:52:44.800
 values, I guess is what I'm trying to get. There's certain values that you have in life. It feels

1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:48.320
 like there's certain values that companies should have. And hard work is one of the things

1:52:49.840 --> 1:52:53.280
 I think that should be admired. I often ask this kind of silly question,

1:52:54.400 --> 1:53:00.720
 just to get a sense of people, like if I'm hiring and so on. I just ask if they think it's better

1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:06.320
 to work hard or work smart. It was helpful for me to get a sense of people from that.

1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:08.720
 Because you think like the right... The answer is both.

1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:10.720
 What's that? The answer is both.

1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:15.760
 The answer is both. I usually try not to give them that, but sometimes I'll say both if that's

1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:22.240
 an option. But a lot of people kind of... A surprising number will say work smart. And there

1:53:22.240 --> 1:53:30.080
 are usually people who don't know how to work smart and they're literally just lazy. Not just

1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:38.080
 that there's two effects behind that. One is laziness and the other is ego. When you're younger

1:53:38.080 --> 1:53:45.040
 and you say it's better to work smart, it means you think you know what it means to work smart

1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:51.600
 at this early stage. To me, people that say work hard or both, they have the humility to understand

1:53:51.600 --> 1:53:57.120
 like I'm going to have to work my ass off because I'm too dumb to know how to work smart. And people

1:53:57.120 --> 1:54:01.520
 who are self critical in this way in some small amount. You have to have some confidence. But

1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:06.800
 if you have humility, that means you're going to actually eventually figure out what it means to

1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:10.480
 work smart. And then to actually be successful, you should do both.

1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:14.720
 So I have a very particular take on this, which is that

1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:24.160
 no one's forcing you to do anything, all choices of consequences. So if you major in,

1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:29.280
 I don't know, theoretical literature. I don't even know if that's a major. I'm just making

1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:33.360
 something up. That's supposed to regular literature. Applied literature.

1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:40.400
 Yeah. Think about like theoretical Spanish lit from the 14th century. Like just make up your

1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:44.880
 esoteric thing. And then the number of people I went to Stanford with who get out in the world

1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:49.040
 and they're like, wait, what? I can't find a job. Like no one wants a theoretical, like

1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:53.760
 there are plenty of counter examples of people have majored in esoteric things and gone on to

1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:58.400
 be very successful. So I just want to be clear. It's not about the major, but every choice you make,

1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:05.200
 whether it's to have kids, like I love my children. It's so awesome to have two kids. And it is so

1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:10.800
 hard to work really hard and also have kids. It's really hard. And there's a reason why

1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:15.600
 certain very successful people like don't have or not successful, but people who run very, very

1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:20.000
 large companies or startups have chosen not to have kids for a while or chosen not to like

1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:25.280
 prioritize them. Everything's a choice. And like I choose to prioritize my children because like

1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:33.440
 I want to do that. So everything's a choice. Now, once you've made that choice, I think it's

1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:38.640
 important that the contract is clear, which is to say, let's imagine you were joining a new startup.

1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:44.960
 It's important that that startup communicate that like the expectation is like, we're all

1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:49.520
 working really, really hard right now. You don't have to join the startup. But like if you do,

1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:56.160
 just know like you're, it's almost as if you join, I don't know, pick your, pick your,

1:55:56.160 --> 1:56:01.440
 pick your like sports team, like let's go back to the Yankees for a second. You want to join the

1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:05.600
 Yankees, but you don't really want to work that hard. You don't really want to do batting practice

1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:12.000
 or pitching practice or whatever for your position, right? That to me is wacko. And that's actually

1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:16.640
 the world that it feels like we live in and tech sometimes where people both want to work for the

1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:22.080
 Yankees because it pays a lot, but like don't actually want to work that hard. That I don't

1:56:22.080 --> 1:56:26.720
 fully understand because if you sign up for some of these things, just sign up for it,

1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:31.600
 but it's okay if you don't want to sign up for it. There's so many wonderful careers in this world

1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:35.760
 that don't require 80 hours a week. But when I read about companies going to like four day work

1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:40.960
 weeks and stuff, I just like, I chuckle because I can't get enough done with a seven day week.

1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:45.120
 I don't know how, and people will say, oh, you're just not working smart. And it's like,

1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:49.200
 no, I work pretty smart, I think in general, like I wouldn't have gotten to this point

1:56:49.200 --> 1:56:54.480
 if I hadn't like some amount of working smart. And there is balance though. So I used to be

1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:59.040
 like a pretty big cyclist. I don't do it much anymore just because of kids and like prioritizing

1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:04.880
 other things, right? But one of the most important things to learn as a cyclist is to take a rest

1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:11.760
 day. But to me and to cyclists, like resting is a function of optimizing for the long run.

1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:17.120
 It's not like a thing that you do for its own merits. It's actually like, if you don't rest,

1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:20.720
 your muscles don't recover, and then you're just not as like, you're not training as efficiently.

1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:25.760
 You should probably, the successful people I've known in terms of athletes, they hate rest days,

1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:30.560
 but they know they have to do it for the long term. Absolutely. They think their opposition

1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:35.120
 is getting stronger and stronger. And that's the feeling, but you know, it's the right thing.

1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:39.760
 And usually you need a coach to help you. Yeah, totally. So I mean, I use this thing called

1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:44.640
 Training Peaks. And it's interesting because it actually mathematically shows like where you are

1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:50.720
 on the curve and all this stuff. But you have to, like you have to have that rest, but it's a function

1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:55.760
 of going harder for longer. Again, it's this reinforcement learning, like planning the aggregate

1:57:55.760 --> 1:57:59.440
 and the long, but a lot of people will hide behind laziness by saying that they're trying

1:57:59.440 --> 1:58:03.520
 to optimize for the long run and they're not, they're just not working very hard. But again,

1:58:03.520 --> 1:58:07.680
 you don't have to sign up for it. It's totally cool. Like I don't think less of people for like

1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:11.680
 not working super hard, just like don't sign up for things that require working super hard.

1:58:11.680 --> 1:58:16.400
 And some of that requires for the leadership to have the guts, the boldness to communicate

1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:20.640
 effectively at the very beginning. I mean, sometimes I think most of the problems arise

1:58:20.640 --> 1:58:29.600
 in the fact that the leadership is kind of hesitant to communicate this socially difficult

1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:36.320
 truth of what it takes to be at this company. And so they kind of say, hey, come with us,

1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:44.080
 there's whiff snacks, but unlimited vacation. And Ray at Bridgewater is always fascinating

1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:50.560
 because people, it's been called like a cult on the outside or cult ish. But what's fascinating is

1:58:50.560 --> 1:58:54.400
 like they just don't give on their principles. They're like, listen, this is what it's like

1:58:54.400 --> 1:58:59.920
 to work here. We record every meeting. We're brutally honest. And that's not going to feel

1:58:59.920 --> 1:59:04.640
 right to everyone. And if it doesn't feel right to you, totally cool. Just go work somewhere else.

1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:10.320
 But if you work here, you are signing up for this. And that's that's been fascinating to me

1:59:10.320 --> 1:59:16.560
 because it's honesty up front. It's a system in which you operate. And if it's not for you,

1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:22.400
 like no one's forcing you to work there, right? I actually did. So I did a conversation with him

1:59:22.400 --> 1:59:28.880
 and kind of got stuck in a funny moment, which is at the end, I asked him to give me honest

1:59:28.880 --> 1:59:35.440
 feedback of how I did on the interview. And I was like, I don't think so. He was super nice.

1:59:36.160 --> 1:59:41.840
 He asked me, he's like, well, tell me, did you accomplish what you're hoping to accomplish?

1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:49.440
 I was like, that's not, that's not, I'm asking you as an objective observer of two people talking,

1:59:49.440 --> 1:59:56.000
 how do we do today? And then he's like, well, he gave me this politician's answer. Well, I feel

1:59:56.000 --> 2:00:01.840
 like we've accomplished successful communication of ideas, which is I'd like I'd love to spread

2:00:01.840 --> 2:00:09.600
 some of the ideas in that like in principles and so on. Back to my original point, it's really hard

2:00:09.600 --> 2:00:14.880
 to get even for a dollar. It's really hard to give feedback. And one of the other things I learned

2:00:14.880 --> 2:00:22.480
 from him and just people in that world is like, man, humans really like to pretend like they've

2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:28.240
 come to that they've come to some kind of meeting of the minds, like if there's conflict, if you and

2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:34.800
 I have conflict, it's always better to meet face to face, right? Or on the phone, Slack is not great,

2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:39.040
 right? Email is not great, but face to face, what's crazy is you and I get together and we

2:00:39.040 --> 2:00:44.800
 actively try to even if we're not actually solving the conflict, we actively try to paper over the

2:00:44.800 --> 2:00:49.840
 conflict. Oh, yeah, it didn't really bother bother me that much. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you didn't mean

2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:55.280
 it. I'm sure. But like, no, in our minds, we're still there. Yeah. So this is one of the things

2:00:55.280 --> 2:01:00.720
 that as a leader, you always have to be digging, especially as you said straight to the conflict.

2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:05.120
 Yeah, as you ascend, no one wants to tell you you're crazy. No one wants to tell you your your

2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:10.800
 ideas bad. And you can you're like, Oh, I'm going to be a leader. And the idea is, well, I'm just

2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:17.120
 going to ask people, I want to tell you. So like you have to look for the markers, knowing that

2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:22.000
 literally just people aren't going to tell you along the way and be paranoid. I mean, you asked

2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:26.320
 about selling, you know, the company, I think one of the biggest differences between me and a lot of

2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:32.640
 other entrepreneurs is like, I wasn't completely confident we could do it. Like we could be alone

2:01:32.640 --> 2:01:38.320
 and and and actually be great. And if any entrepreneurs honest with you, they also feel

2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:43.200
 that way. But a lot of people are like, well, I have to be cocky and just say, I can do this on

2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:48.400
 my own. We're going to be fine. We're going to crush everyone. Some people do say that. And then

2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:55.360
 it's not right. And they and they fail. But being honest in that moment with yourself,

2:01:55.360 --> 2:02:01.920
 with those close to you. And also, you talked about the personality of leaders and who resonates

2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:11.840
 and who doesn't. It's rare that I see leaders be vulnerable, rare. And one thing I tried to do

2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:18.240
 at Instagram, at least internally, was like, say when I screwed up, and like, point out how I was

2:02:18.240 --> 2:02:24.320
 wrong about things and point out where my judgment was off. Everyone thinks they have to bat 1000.

2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:30.800
 Right? Like, that's crazy. The best quant hedge funds in the world bat 50.001%.

2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:37.840
 They just take a lot of bets, right? Renaissance. They might they might bat 51%, right? But

2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:44.640
 holy hell, like, the question isn't, are you right every single time and you have to seem invincible?

2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:51.520
 The question is, how many at bats do you get? And on average, are you, are you better on average?

2:02:52.720 --> 2:02:57.280
 Right? With enough bets and enough at bats that your aggregate can be very high.

2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:04.560
 I mean, Steve Jobs was wrong at a lot of stuff. The Newton was too early, right? Next, not quite

2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:12.160
 right. There was even a time when he said like, no one will ever want to watch a video on the iPod.

2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:17.600
 Totally wrong. But who cares if you come around and realize your mistake and fix it?

2:03:18.400 --> 2:03:22.320
 It becomes just like you said, harder and harder when your ego grows and the number of people

2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:27.920
 around you that say positive things towards you grows. And I actually think it's really valuable

2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:35.040
 that like let's manage and a counterfactual where Instagram became worth like $300 billion or something

2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:41.200
 crazy, right? I kind of like that my life is relatively normal now. When I say relatively,

2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:45.280
 you get what I mean. I'm not making a claim that I live a normal life. But like, I certainly don't

2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:51.040
 live in a world where there are like 15 Sherpas following me, like fetching me water or whatever.

2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:56.480
 Like, that's not how it works. I actually like that I have a sense of humility of like,

2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:00.400
 I may not found another thing that's nearly as big. So I have to work twice as hard.

2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:06.800
 Or I have to like learn twice as much. I have to read my, we haven't talked about machine

2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:14.240
 learning yet. But my favorite thing is all these like famous, you know, tech guys who have worked

2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:18.160
 in the industry, pontificating about the future of machine learning and how it's going to kill us

2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:23.680
 all. And like, I'm pretty sure they've never tried to build anything with machine learning

2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:29.520
 themselves. Yes. So there's a nice line between people that actually build stuff with machine,

2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:33.840
 like actually program something, or at least understand some of those fundamentals and the

2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:39.680
 people that are just saying philosophical stuff or journalists and so on. It's, it's a, it's an

2:04:39.680 --> 2:04:44.000
 interesting line to walk because the people who program are often not philosophers.

2:04:44.720 --> 2:04:48.160
 Or don't have the attention. They can't write an op ed for the Wall Street Journal like it

2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:52.720
 doesn't work. So like, it's nice to be both a little bit, like to have elements of both.

2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:58.000
 My point is the fact that I have to learn stuff from scratch or that I choose to or like,

2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:03.440
 it's humbling. Yeah. I mean, again, I have a lot of advantages. I like,

2:05:04.240 --> 2:05:13.040
 but my point is it's awesome to be back in a game where you have to fight. That is, that's fun.

2:05:13.040 --> 2:05:18.480
 So being humble, being vulnerable, it's an important aspect of a leader. And I hope it

2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:23.120
 serves me well, but like, I can't fast forward 10 years to know. I've just, that's my game plan.

2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:27.040
 Before I forget, I have to ask you one last thing on Instagram.

2:05:28.800 --> 2:05:33.840
 What do you think about the whistleblower Francis Haugen recently coming out and saying that

2:05:33.840 --> 2:05:41.120
 Facebook is aware of Instagram's harmful effect on teenage girls as per their own

2:05:41.120 --> 2:05:44.160
 internal research studies and the matter? What do you think about this

2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:50.480
 baby of yours, Instagram, being under fire now, as we've been talking about under the leadership of Facebook?

2:05:52.880 --> 2:06:02.400
 You know, I often question, where does the blame lie? Is the blame at the people that originated the

2:06:02.400 --> 2:06:10.880
 network, me, right? Is the blame at like the decision to combine the network with another

2:06:10.880 --> 2:06:19.920
 network with a certain set of values? Is the blame at how it gets run after I left? Like,

2:06:19.920 --> 2:06:27.840
 is it the driver? Is it the car? Right? Is it that someone enabled these devices in the first place

2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:36.080
 if you go to an extreme, right? Or is it the users themselves, just human nature? Is it just the way

2:06:36.080 --> 2:06:41.360
 of human nature? Sure. And the idea that we're going to find a mutually exclusive answer here

2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:46.240
 is crazy. There's not one place that's a combination of a lot of these things. And then the question

2:06:46.240 --> 2:06:53.440
 is, is it true at all? I'm not actually saying that it's not true or that it's true, but there's

2:06:53.440 --> 2:07:00.400
 always more nuance here. Do I believe that social media has an effect on young people? Well, it's

2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:04.720
 God who they use it a lot. And I bet you there are a lot of positive effects and I bet you there

2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:10.240
 are negative effects, just like any technology. And where I've come to in my thinking on this is

2:07:10.240 --> 2:07:15.600
 that I think any technology has negative side effects. The question is, as a leader, what do

2:07:15.600 --> 2:07:19.600
 you do about them? And are you actively working on them or do you just like not really believe in

2:07:19.600 --> 2:07:24.000
 them? If you're a leader that sits there and says, well, we're going to put an enormous amount of

2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:29.920
 resources against this, we're going to acknowledge when there are true criticisms, we're going to

2:07:29.920 --> 2:07:34.400
 be vulnerable and that we're not perfect. And we're going to go fix them and we're going to be held

2:07:34.400 --> 2:07:42.400
 accountable along the way. I think that people generally really respect that. But I think that

2:07:42.400 --> 2:07:46.000
 where Facebook, I think, has had issues in the past is where they say things like,

2:07:46.640 --> 2:07:50.240
 I can't remember what Mark said about misinformation during the election. There was

2:07:50.240 --> 2:07:54.720
 that famous quote where he's like, it's pretty crazy to think that Facebook had anything to

2:07:54.720 --> 2:07:58.400
 do with this election. That was something like that quote. And I don't remember what stage he was

2:07:58.400 --> 2:08:07.760
 on. But that did not age well. You have to be willing to say, well, maybe there's something

2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:13.520
 there. And wow, I want to go look into it and truly believe it in your gut. But if people look at

2:08:13.520 --> 2:08:17.920
 you and how you act and what you say and don't believe, you truly feel that way?

2:08:18.560 --> 2:08:22.720
 It's not just the words you say, but how you say them and that people believe they actually feel

2:08:22.720 --> 2:08:28.080
 the pain of having caused any suffering in the world. So to me, it's much more about your

2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:36.640
 actions and your posture post event than it is about debugging the why. I don't know this research.

2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:42.880
 It was written well after I left. Is it the algorithm? Is it the explore page? Is it the

2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:49.200
 people you might know unit connecting you to ideas that are dangerous? I really don't know.

2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:56.400
 So we'd have to have a much deeper dive to understand where the blame lies.

2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:00.560
 What's very unpleasant to me to consider now, I don't know if this is true, but

2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:06.880
 to consider the very fact that there might be some complicated games being played here.

2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:12.800
 For example, you know, as somebody, I really love psychology. And I love it enough to know

2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:18.080
 that the field is pretty broken. In the following way, it's very difficult to study human beings

2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:23.520
 well at scale. Because the questions you ask affect the results, you can you can basically

2:09:23.520 --> 2:09:28.720
 get any results you want. And so you have an internal Facebook study that asks some question

2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:33.280
 of which we don't know the full details. And there's some kind of analysis. But that's just

2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:39.840
 the one little tiny slice into some much bigger picture. And so you can have thousands of employees

2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:46.320
 at Facebook, one of them comes out and picks whatever narrative, knowing that they become famous

2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:52.560
 coupled with the other really uncomfortable thing I see in the world, which is journalists seem to

2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:57.520
 understand they get a lot of clickbait attention from saying something negative about social

2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:05.200
 networks, certain companies like they even get some, some clickbait stuff about Tesla or about,

2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:12.160
 especially when it's like, when there's a public famous CEO type of person, if they get a lot of

2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:16.880
 views on the negative, not the positive, the positive they'll get. I mean, it actually goes to

2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:21.840
 the thing you were saying before, if there's a hot sexy new product, that's great to look forward

2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:29.120
 to they get positive on that. But absent a product, it's nice to have like the CEO messing up with

2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:36.720
 some kind of way. And so couple that with the whistleblower, and with the this whole dynamic

2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:42.160
 of journalism and so on, you know, with social dilemma being really popular documentary, it's

2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:49.840
 like, all right, my concern is there's deep flaws in human nature here, in terms of things we need

2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:57.200
 to deal with, like the nature of hate, bullying, all those kinds of things. And then there's people

2:10:57.200 --> 2:11:05.680
 who are trying to use that potentially to become famous and make money off of blaming others for

2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:10.080
 causing more of the problem as opposed to helping solve the problem. So I don't know what to think.

2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:15.200
 I'm not saying this is like, I'm just uncomfortable with, I guess, not knowing what to think about

2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:20.480
 any of this. Because a bunch of folks I know that work at Facebook, on the machine learning side,

2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:25.920
 so Jan Likun, I mean, they, they're quite upset by what's happening, because there's a lot of

2:11:25.920 --> 2:11:31.520
 really brilliant good people inside Facebook, they're trying to do good. And so like, all of

2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:35.600
 this press, Jan is one of them. And he has an amazing team of machine learning researchers,

2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:41.600
 like, he's really upset with the fact that people don't seem to understand that this this is not

2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:46.400
 the portrayal does not represent the full nature of efforts that's going on on Facebook.

2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:50.800
 So I don't know what to think about that. Well, you just, I think, very

2:11:50.800 --> 2:11:56.640
 helpfully explain the nuance of the situation and why it's so hard to understand. But a couple

2:11:56.640 --> 2:12:12.720
 things. One is, I think I have been surprised at the scale with which some product manager can do

2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:19.360
 an enormous amount of harm to a very, very large company by releasing a trove of documents. Like,

2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:23.120
 I think I read a couple of them when they got published, and I haven't even spent any time

2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:27.360
 going deep. Part of it's like, I don't really feel like reliving a previous life. But

2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:35.920
 wow, like talk about challenging the idea of open culture and like what that does to

2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:43.680
 Facebook internally, if Facebook was built, like I remember, like my office, we had this,

2:12:43.680 --> 2:12:47.600
 like, no visitors rule around my office, because we always had like confidential stuff up on the

2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:52.720
 walls and never was super angry, because they're like, that goes against our culture of transparency.

2:12:52.720 --> 2:12:56.880
 And like Mark's in the fish cube or whatever they call it, the aquarium, I think they called it,

2:12:57.680 --> 2:13:03.440
 where like literally anyone could see what he was doing at any point. And I don't know. I mean,

2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:10.160
 other companies like Apple have been quiet slash lockdown, Snapchat's the same way for a reason.

2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:17.040
 And I don't know what this does to transparency on the inside of startups that value that. I think

2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:22.160
 that it's a seminal moment. And you can say, well, you should have nothing to hide, right?

2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:28.320
 But to your point, you can pick out documents that show anything, right? But I don't know. So

2:13:28.960 --> 2:13:32.160
 what happens to transparency inside of startups and the culture that

2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:38.240
 startups or companies in the future will grow? Like the startup of the future that becomes

2:13:38.240 --> 2:13:44.640
 the next Facebook will be locked down. And what does that do? Right? So that's part one. Part two.

2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:55.040
 Like, I don't think that you could design a more like well orchestrated handful of

2:13:55.040 --> 2:14:01.920
 events from the like 60 minutes to releasing the documents in the way that they were released

2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:07.520
 at the right time. That takes a lot of planning and partnership. And it seems like she has a

2:14:07.520 --> 2:14:15.360
 partner at some firm, right, that probably helped a lot with this. But man, on a personal level,

2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:22.160
 if you're her, you'd have to really believe in what you are doing, really believe in it,

2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:27.920
 because you are personally putting your ass on the line, right? Like, you've got a very large

2:14:27.920 --> 2:14:38.240
 company that doesn't like enemies, right? It takes a lot of guts. And I don't love these

2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:42.720
 conspiracy theories about like, oh, she's being financed from some person or people like, I don't

2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:48.560
 love them because that's like the easy thing to say. I think that the Occam's razor here is like

2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:56.160
 someone thought they were doing something wrong, and was like very, very courageous. And I don't

2:14:56.160 --> 2:15:01.920
 know if courageous is the word, but like, so without getting into like, is she a martyr? Is she

2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:06.800
 courageous? Is she right? Like, let's put that aside for a second. Then there are the documents

2:15:06.800 --> 2:15:12.480
 themselves. They say what they say. To your point, a lot of the things that like people have been

2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:17.280
 worried about, are already in the documents or they're already been said externally. And

2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:24.160
 I don't know. I'm just like, I'm thankful that I am focused on new things with my life.

2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:30.720
 Well, let me just say, I just think it's a really hard problem that probably Facebook and Twitter

2:15:30.720 --> 2:15:35.200
 are trying to solve. I'm actually just fascinated by how hard this problem is.

2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:41.680
 There are fundamental issues at Facebook in tone and in an approach of how product gets built and

2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:49.600
 the objective functions. And since people, organizations are not people. So yawn and fair,

2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:53.200
 right? Like, there are a lot of really great people who like literally just want to push

2:15:53.200 --> 2:15:59.040
 reinforcement learning forward. They literally just want to teach a robot to touch, feel, lift,

2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:05.600
 right? Like, they're not thinking about political misinformation, right? But there's a strong

2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:13.280
 connection between what funds that research and an enormously profitable machine that has tradeoffs.

2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:20.640
 And one cannot separate the two. You are not completely separate from the system.

2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:26.960
 So, I agree. It can feel really frustrating to feel if you're internal there, that you're working

2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:31.840
 on something completely unrelated and you feel like your group's good. I can understand that.

2:16:31.840 --> 2:16:35.200
 But there's some responsibility still. You have to acknowledge, it's like the right

2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:39.040
 value thing. You have to look in the mirror and see if there's problems and you have to fix those

2:16:39.040 --> 2:16:46.640
 problems. Yeah. You've mentioned machine learning and reinforcement quite a bit. I mean, to me,

2:16:46.640 --> 2:16:52.000
 social networks is one of the exciting places, the recommender systems where machine learning is

2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:58.000
 applied. Where else in the world, in the space of possibilities over the next 5, 10, 20 years,

2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:04.000
 do you think we're going to see impact over machine learning when you try it? On the philosophical

2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:09.040
 level, on a technical level, what do you think? Or within social networks themselves?

2:17:09.040 --> 2:17:18.640
 Well, I think the obvious answers are climate change. Think about how much fuel

2:17:19.680 --> 2:17:28.320
 or just waste there is in energy consumption today because we don't plan accordingly. Because we

2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:32.880
 take the least efficient route. The logistics and stuff, the supply chain and all that kind

2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:40.240
 of stuff. Yeah. Listen, if we're going to fight climate change, one awesome way to do it is figure

2:17:40.240 --> 2:17:47.280
 out how to optimize how we operate as a species and minimize the amount of energy we consume to

2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:53.040
 maximize whatever economic impact we want to have. Because right now, those two are very much tied

2:17:53.040 --> 2:17:58.240
 together. And I don't believe that has to be the case. There's this really interesting, you've read

2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:03.920
 it, for people who are listening. There's this really interesting paper on reinforcement learning

2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:08.960
 and energy consumption inside buildings. It's one of the seminal ones. But imagine that at

2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:16.160
 massive scale. That's super interesting. They've done resource planning for servers for peak load

2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:20.240
 using reinforcement learning. I don't know if that was at Google or somewhere else, but like,

2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:24.400
 okay, great, you do it for servers. But what if you could do it for just capacity and general

2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:29.840
 energy capacity for cities and planning for traffic. And of course, there's all the self

2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:38.880
 driving cars. And I don't know, I'm not going to pontificate crazy ideas using reinforcement

2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:43.520
 learning or machine learning. It's just so clear to me that humans don't think quickly enough.

2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:50.000
 So it's interesting to think about machine learning helping a little bit at scale. So a

2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:55.920
 little bit to a large number of people that has a huge impact. So if you optimize, it's like Google

2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:02.240
 Maps, something like that trajectory planning or what the map quest first, getting here, I looked

2:19:02.240 --> 2:19:05.680
 and it was like, here's the most energy efficient route. And I was like, I'm going to be late. I

2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:11.520
 need to take the fastest route as opposed to unrolling the map. Yeah. Yeah. Like, and that's

2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:15.440
 going to be very inefficient no matter what. I was definitely the other day, like part of the

2:19:15.440 --> 2:19:22.400
 Epsilon of Epsilon greedy with ways where like I was sent on like a weird route that I could tell

2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:29.600
 they're like, we just need to collect data of this road. Kevin's definitely going to be the

2:19:29.600 --> 2:19:35.040
 guinea pig. And great. Now we have the Julli's feel pride. Oh, going through it. I was like,

2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:39.040
 Oh, this is fun. Like now they get data about this weird shortcut. And actually I hit all the

2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:43.440
 green lights networked. I'm like, this is a problem. This is bad data. Bad data. They're just

2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:47.840
 going to imagine. I could see you slowing down and stopping at a green light just to give them

2:19:47.840 --> 2:19:52.320
 the right kind of data. But to answer your question, like I feel like that was fairly

2:19:52.320 --> 2:19:58.640
 unsatisfying and it's easy to say climate change. But what I would say is at Instagram,

2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:04.640
 everything we applied machining learning to got better for users and it got better for the company.

2:20:04.640 --> 2:20:09.200
 And I saw the power. I didn't fully understand it as an executive. And I think that's actually one

2:20:09.200 --> 2:20:14.640
 of the issues that and when I say understand, I mean the mathematics of it. Like I understand

2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:21.680
 what it does. I understand that it helps. But there are a lot of executives now that talk about it

2:20:21.680 --> 2:20:25.440
 in the way that they talk about the internet or they talked about the internet like 10 years ago,

2:20:25.440 --> 2:20:28.080
 they're like, we're going to build mobile. And you're like, what does that mean? They're like,

2:20:28.080 --> 2:20:33.760
 we're just going to do mobile. And you're like, okay. So my sense is the next generation of leaders

2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:39.440
 will have grown up having had classes in reinforcement learning, supervised learning, whatever.

2:20:40.080 --> 2:20:45.040
 And they will be able to thoughtfully apply it to their companies and the places that it is needed

2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:53.680
 most. And that's really cool. Because I mean, talk about efficiency gains. That's what excites me

2:20:53.680 --> 2:20:58.800
 the most about it. Yeah. So there's, it's interesting just to get a fundamental first principle is

2:20:58.800 --> 2:21:03.760
 understanding of certain concepts of machine learning. So supervised learning from an executive

2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:08.320
 perspective, supervised learning, you have to have a lot of humans label a lot of data.

2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:13.520
 So the question there is, okay, can we gather a large amount of data that can be labeled well?

2:21:14.240 --> 2:21:18.160
 And that's the question Tesla asked, like, can we create a data engine that keeps

2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:24.880
 sending an imperfect machine learning system out there? Whenever it fails, it gives us data back,

2:21:24.880 --> 2:21:29.600
 we label it by human and we send it back and forth to this way. Then there is a young,

2:21:29.600 --> 2:21:36.000
 the Coons excited about the self supervised learning, where you do much less human labeling.

2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:41.600
 And there's some kind of mechanism for the system to learn it by itself on the human

2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:45.280
 generated data. And then there's the reinforcement learning, which is like,

2:21:46.400 --> 2:21:54.400
 basically allowing it's applying the alpha zero technology that allow through self play

2:21:54.400 --> 2:22:00.800
 to learn how to solve the game of go and achieve incredible levels at the game of chess.

2:22:02.400 --> 2:22:06.720
 Can you formulate the problem you're trying to solve in a way that's amenable to reinforcement

2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:11.680
 learning? And can you get the right kind of signal at scale? Because you need a lot, a lot of signal.

2:22:11.680 --> 2:22:17.520
 And that's, that's kind of fascinating to see which part of a social network can you convert

2:22:17.520 --> 2:22:22.160
 into a reinforcement learning problem. The fascinating thing about reinforcement learning,

2:22:22.160 --> 2:22:34.160
 I think, is that we now have learned to apply neural networks to guess the Q function,

2:22:34.160 --> 2:22:39.840
 basically the values for any state in action. And that is fascinating because we used to just

2:22:39.840 --> 2:22:43.760
 like, I don't know, have like a linear regression like hope it worked. And that was the fanciest

2:22:43.760 --> 2:22:47.920
 version of it. But now you look at it, I'm like trying to learn this stuff. And I look at it,

2:22:47.920 --> 2:22:52.720
 I'm like, there are like 17 different acronyms of different ways you can try to apply this.

2:22:52.720 --> 2:22:57.520
 No one quite agrees. Like, what's the best? Generally, if you're trying to like build a

2:22:57.520 --> 2:23:04.400
 neural network, they're pretty well trodden ways of doing that. You use Adam, you use Reilu, you

2:23:04.400 --> 2:23:09.360
 like, there's just like general good ideas. And in reinforcement learning, I feel like the

2:23:09.360 --> 2:23:16.400
 consensus is like, it totally depends. And by the way, it's really hard to get it to converge. And

2:23:16.400 --> 2:23:21.920
 it's noisy. And it like, so there are all these really interesting ideas around building simulators.

2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:28.640
 You know, like, for instance, in self driving, right? Like, you don't want to like, actually

2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:33.360
 have someone getting in an accident to learn that an accident is bad. So you start simulating

2:23:33.360 --> 2:23:37.520
 accidents, simulating aggressive drivers or simulating crazy dogs that run into the street.

2:23:39.040 --> 2:23:44.000
 Wow, fascinating, right? Like my mind starts racing. And then the question is, okay, forget

2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:51.680
 about self driving cars, let's talk about social networks. How can you produce a better, more

2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:57.680
 thoughtful experience using these types of algorithms? And honestly, in talking to some

2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:02.880
 of the people that work at Facebook and old Instagrammers, most people are like, yeah,

2:24:02.880 --> 2:24:07.280
 we tried a lot of things, didn't quite ever make it work. And for the longest time, Facebook ads

2:24:07.280 --> 2:24:12.320
 was effectively a logistic regression. Okay, I don't know what it is now. But like, if you look at

2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:15.920
 this paper that they published back in the day, it was literally just a logistic regression.

2:24:15.920 --> 2:24:23.200
 They had a lot of money. So even at these like, extremely large scales, if we are not yet touching

2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:27.280
 what reinforcement learning can truly do, imagine what the next 10 years looks like.

2:24:27.280 --> 2:24:32.400
 Yeah. How cool is that? It's amazing. So I really like the use of reinforcement learning as part

2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:37.920
 of the simulation, for example, like, with self driving cars, it's modeling pedestrians. So

2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:44.240
 the nice thing about reinforcement learning, it can be used to learn agents within the world.

2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:48.560
 So they can learn to behave properly. Like you can teach pedestrians that,

2:24:49.200 --> 2:24:54.000
 like you don't hard code the way they behave. They learn how to behave. And that same way,

2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:58.880
 I do have a hope was that Jack Dorsey talks about healthy conversations. You talked about

2:24:59.840 --> 2:25:01.600
 meaningful interactions, I believe. Yeah.

2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:10.000
 Yeah. Like, simulating interactions. So you can learn how to manage that. It's fascinating. So

2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:16.400
 where most of your algorithm development happens in virtual worlds. And then you can really learn

2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:22.480
 how to design the interface, how you design much of aspects of the experience, in terms of the,

2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:27.040
 how you select what's shown in the feed, all those kinds of things that it feels like if you

2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:33.520
 can connect reinforcement learning to that, that's super exciting. Yep. And I think if you have a

2:25:33.520 --> 2:25:37.840
 company and leadership that believe in doing the right things and can apply this technology in the

2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:44.240
 right way, some really special stuff can happen. It is mostly likely going to be a group of people

2:25:44.240 --> 2:25:51.360
 we've never heard about, start up from scratch, right? And you asked if like new social networks

2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:57.840
 could be built. I've got to imagine they will be. And whoever starts it, it might be some kids in a

2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:03.840
 garage that took these classes from these people, you, right? Like, and they're building all of

2:26:03.840 --> 2:26:08.320
 these things with this tech at the core. So I'm trying not to be someone who just like throws

2:26:08.320 --> 2:26:15.440
 around reinforcement learning as a buzzword. I truly believe that it is the most cutting edge

2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:21.120
 in what can happen in social networks. And I also believe it's super hard. Like, it's super hard to

2:26:21.120 --> 2:26:25.360
 make it work. It's super hard to do it at scale. It's super hard to find people that truly understand

2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:31.680
 it. So I'm not going to say that like, I think it'll be applied in social networks before we have

2:26:31.680 --> 2:26:36.480
 true self driving. Let me put it that way. We could argue about this for a long time. But yes,

2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:41.360
 I agree with you. I think self driving is way harder than people realize. Oh, absolutely. Let me

2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:46.000
 ask you, in terms of that kid in the garage or those couple of kids in the garage, what advice

2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:51.360
 would you give to them if they want to start a new social network or a business? What advice would

2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:59.360
 you give to somebody with a big dream and a young startup? To me, you have to choose to do something

2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:06.800
 that even if it fails, like it was so fun, right? Like, we never started Instagram knowing it was

2:27:06.800 --> 2:27:12.640
 going to be big. We started Instagram because we loved photography. We loved social networks. I had

2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:17.520
 seen what other social networks had done. And I thought, hmm, maybe we put did a spin on this.

2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:23.120
 But like, nowhere was our fate predestined. Like, it wasn't like, it wasn't written out

2:27:23.120 --> 2:27:27.040
 anywhere that everything was going to go great. And I often think the counterfactual, like,

2:27:27.040 --> 2:27:31.120
 what if it had not gone well? I would be like, I don't know, that was fun. We raised some money.

2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:38.480
 We learned some stuff. And does it position you well for the next experience? That's the advice

2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:43.920
 that I would give to anyone wanting to start something today, which is like, does this meet with

2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:48.640
 your ultimate goals, not wealth, not fame, none of that, because all of that, by the way, is bullshit.

2:27:49.840 --> 2:27:55.520
 You can get super famous and super wealthy. And I think generally, those are not things that,

2:27:55.520 --> 2:28:01.680
 again, it's easy to say with a lot of money that somehow it's not good to have a lot of money.

2:28:01.680 --> 2:28:06.240
 It's just, I think that complicates life enormously in a way that people don't fully

2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:10.960
 comprehend. So I think it is way more interesting to shoot for, can I make something that people love

2:28:11.520 --> 2:28:16.960
 that provides value in the world that I love building, that I love working on, that I write?

2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.800
 That's what I would do if I were starting from scratch. And by the way, in some ways,

2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:27.360
 that I will do that personally, which is like, choose the thing that you get up every morning,

2:28:27.360 --> 2:28:35.760
 you're like, I love this, even when it's painful. Even when it's painful. What about a social network

2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:42.640
 specifically? If you were to imagine, put yourself in the mind, compete against myself. I can't give

2:28:42.640 --> 2:28:47.760
 out ideas. Okay, I got you. No, but it's like high level. You like focus on community. Yeah.

2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:56.560
 Yeah. I said that as a, as a half joke. In all honesty, I think these things are so hard to

2:28:56.560 --> 2:29:02.240
 build that like ideas are a dime a dozen. But you have to talk about keeping it simple.

2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:08.160
 Can I tell you, which is a liberating idea? Yes. It's three circles and they overlap.

2:29:08.160 --> 2:29:13.280
 One circle is, what do I have experience at slash what am I good at? I don't like saying

2:29:13.280 --> 2:29:18.240
 what am I good at? Because it just like seems like, what do I have experience in? Right? What

2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:22.560
 can I bring to the table? What am I excited about is the other circle? What gets it? Well,

2:29:22.560 --> 2:29:26.640
 it's just super cool, right? That I want to work on because even when this is hard,

2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:33.840
 I think it's so cool. I want to stick with it. And the last circle is like, what does the world need?

2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:38.240
 And if that circle ain't there, it doesn't matter what you work on, because there are a lot of

2:29:38.240 --> 2:29:43.840
 startups that exist that just no one needs or very small markets need. But if you want to be

2:29:43.840 --> 2:29:49.520
 successful, I think if you're like, if you're good at it, you have it, sorry, if you're good at it,

2:29:49.520 --> 2:29:52.880
 you're passionate about it and the world needs it. I mean, this sounds simple,

2:29:52.880 --> 2:29:56.240
 but not enough people sit down and just think about those circles and think,

2:29:57.040 --> 2:30:00.640
 do these things overlap? And then can I get that middle section? It's small, but can I get that

2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:07.200
 middle section? I think a lot about that personally. And then you have to be really

2:30:07.200 --> 2:30:15.920
 honest about the circle that you're good at and really honest about the circle that the world needs.

2:30:16.960 --> 2:30:23.280
 And as opposed to really honest about the passion, what do you actually love? As opposed to some

2:30:23.280 --> 2:30:26.480
 kind of dream of making money, all those kinds of stuff. I literally love doing it.

2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:31.200
 I had a former engineer who decided to start a startup and I was like, are you sure you want

2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:39.040
 to start a company versus like join something else? Because being a coach of an NBA team and playing

2:30:39.040 --> 2:30:44.480
 basketball are two very, very different things. And like not everyone fully understands the

2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:52.320
 difference. I think you can kind of do it both. And I don't know, jury's out on that one because

2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:58.000
 like they're in the middle of it now. So but it's really important to figure out what you're good

2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:04.720
 at, not be full of yourself, like truly look at your track record. What's the saying like it ain't

2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:13.600
 bragging if you could, if you can do it. But too many people are delusional and like think they're

2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:17.280
 better at things than they actually are or think there's a bigger market than there actually is.

2:31:18.480 --> 2:31:22.080
 When you confuse your passion for things with a big market, that's really scary,

2:31:23.120 --> 2:31:26.960
 right? Like just because you think it's cool doesn't mean that it's a big business opportunity.

2:31:26.960 --> 2:31:31.680
 So like what evidence do you have? Again, I'm a fairly like I'm a strict rationalist on this.

2:31:32.400 --> 2:31:37.040
 And like sometimes people don't like working with me because I'm pretty pragmatic about things.

2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:44.000
 Like I'm not, I'm not Elon. Like I don't sit and make bold proclamations about visiting Mars.

2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:48.480
 Like that's just not how I work. I'm like, okay, I want to build this really cool thing that's

2:31:48.480 --> 2:31:53.840
 fairly practical. And I think we could do it and it's in this way. And what's cool though is like

2:31:53.840 --> 2:31:59.040
 that's just my sweet spot. I'm not like, I just, I can't, I can't with a straight face talk about

2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:05.040
 the metaverse. I can't, I just, it's not me. What do you think about the Facebook renaming

2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:08.560
 itself to meta? I didn't mean that as a dig. I just literally mean like I'm fairly,

2:32:09.280 --> 2:32:13.840
 I like to live in the next five years. And like what things can I get out in a year that people

2:32:13.840 --> 2:32:20.640
 will use at scale? And so it's just, again, those circles I think are different for different

2:32:20.640 --> 2:32:25.920
 people, but it's important to realize that like market matters, you being good at it matters

2:32:25.920 --> 2:32:32.720
 and having passion for it matters. Your question, sorry. Well, on last, on this topic, in terms of

2:32:32.720 --> 2:32:44.880
 funding, is there by way of advice, was funding in your own journey helpful, unhelpful? Like,

2:32:44.880 --> 2:32:49.360
 is there a right time to get funding? Venture funding. Venture funding or anything,

2:32:49.360 --> 2:32:54.720
 borrow some money from your parents? I don't know. But like, is money getting in the way?

2:32:54.720 --> 2:32:58.960
 Does it help? Is the timing important? Is there some kind of wisdom you can

2:32:59.680 --> 2:33:02.640
 give there? Because you were exceptionally successful very quickly.

2:33:06.480 --> 2:33:10.880
 Funding helps as long as it's from the right people. That includes yourself. And I'll talk

2:33:10.880 --> 2:33:16.400
 about myself funding myself in a second, which is like, because I can fund myself doing whatever

2:33:16.400 --> 2:33:21.440
 projects I can do, I don't really have another person putting pressure on me except for myself.

2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:27.200
 And that creates strange dynamics, right? But let's talk about people getting funding from

2:33:27.200 --> 2:33:33.120
 a venture capitalist initially. We raised money from Matt Kohler at Benchmark. He's brilliant,

2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:40.960
 amazing guy, very thoughtful. And he was very helpful early on. But I have stories from entrepreneurs

2:33:40.960 --> 2:33:45.520
 where they raised money from the wrong person or the wrong firm where incentives weren't aligned.

2:33:46.640 --> 2:33:51.520
 They didn't think in the same way. And bad things happened because of that. The board

2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:56.080
 of room was always noisy. There were fights. We just never had that. Matt was great.

2:33:56.960 --> 2:34:02.480
 I think capital these days is kind of a dime a dozen, right? Like, as long as you're

2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:09.520
 fundable, it seems like there's money out there is what I'm hearing. It's really important that

2:34:09.520 --> 2:34:14.160
 you are aligned and that you think of raising money as hiring someone for your team rather than

2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:20.080
 taking money if capital is plentiful, right? It provides a certain amount of pressure

2:34:20.800 --> 2:34:25.600
 to do the right thing that I think is healthy for any startup. And it keeps you real and honest

2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:29.920
 because they don't want to lose their money. They're paid to not lose their money. The problem,

2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:36.640
 maybe I could depersonalize it, but I remember having lunch with Elon. It only happened once.

2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:42.880
 And I asked him, I was trying to figure out what it was doing after Instagram, right? And I asked

2:34:42.880 --> 2:34:46.560
 him something about angel investing. And he looked at me with a straight face and was like,

2:34:46.560 --> 2:34:52.400
 why the F would I do that? I was like, I don't know. You're connected. Seems like,

2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:59.600
 he's like, I only invest in myself. I was like, okay. Not the confidence. I was just like,

2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:06.000
 what a novel idea. It's like, yeah, if you have money, why not just put it against your bag and

2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:12.960
 like enable you're visiting Mars or something, right? Like, that's awesome. Great. But I had

2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:17.760
 never really thought of it that way. But also with that comes an interesting dynamic where

2:35:19.520 --> 2:35:25.520
 you don't actually have people who are going to lose that money telling you, hey, don't do this or

2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:30.640
 hey, you need to face this reality. So you need to create other versions of that truth teller.

2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:37.680
 And whatever I do next, that's going to be one of the interesting challenges is how do you create

2:35:37.680 --> 2:35:42.800
 that truth telling situation. And that's part of why by the way, I think someone like Jack,

2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:47.440
 when you start Square, you have money, but you still you bring on partners because I think it

2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:54.400
 creates a truth telling type environment. I'm still trying to figure this out. It's an interesting

2:35:55.680 --> 2:36:00.480
 dynamic. So you're thinking of perhaps launching some kind of venture where you're investing

2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:08.080
 in yourself. I mean, I'm 37 going on 38 next month. I have a long life to live. I'm not

2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:13.680
 definitely not going to sit on the beach, right? So I'm going to do something at some point. And

2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:20.080
 I got to imagine I will I will like help fund it, right? So the other way of thinking about this is

2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:24.320
 you could park your money in the SMP and this is bad because the SMP has done wonderfully well

2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:30.400
 the last year, right? Or you can invest in yourself. And if you're not going to invest in

2:36:30.400 --> 2:36:33.680
 yourself, you probably shouldn't do a startup. It's kind of the way of thinking about it.

2:36:35.680 --> 2:36:41.200
 And you can invest yourself in the way Elon does, which is basically go all in on this investment.

2:36:41.200 --> 2:36:45.360
 Maybe that's one way to achieve accountability is like, you're kind of screwed if you're if you

2:36:45.360 --> 2:36:53.120
 fail. Yeah, that's yeah. I personally like that. I like burning bridges behind me so that I'm

2:36:53.120 --> 2:37:01.200
 fucked if it fails. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's really important, though. One of the things I think

2:37:01.200 --> 2:37:07.600
 Mark said to me early on that sticks with me that I think is true. We were talking about people who

2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:12.400
 had left like operating roles and started doing venture or something. It was like a lot of people

2:37:12.400 --> 2:37:16.880
 convinced themselves they work really hard, like they think they work really hard and they put on

2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:22.560
 the show and in their minds, they work really hard, but they don't work very hard. There is

2:37:22.560 --> 2:37:27.440
 something about lighting a fire underneath you and burning bridges such that you can't turn back.

2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:34.880
 That I think we didn't talk about this specifically, but I think you're right. You need to have that

2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:41.840
 because there's this self delusion at a certain scale. Oh, I have so many board calls. Oh, we have

2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:46.960
 all these things to figure out. It's like, this is one of the hard parts about it being an operator.

2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:52.080
 It's like, there are so many people that have made a lot of money not operating,

2:37:52.640 --> 2:37:57.200
 but operating is just one of the hardest things on earth. It is just so effing hard.

2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:02.960
 It is stressful. It is you're dealing with real humans, not just like throwing capital in and

2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:08.960
 hoping it grows. I'm not undermining the VC mindset. I think it's a wonderful thing and needed and

2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:15.120
 so many wonderful VCs I've worked with. But yeah, like when your ass is on the line and it's your

2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:22.640
 money, it's talk to me in 10 years. We'll see how it goes. Yeah, but like you were saying,

2:38:22.640 --> 2:38:28.720
 that is a source. When you wake up in the morning and you look forward to the day full of challenges,

2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:33.200
 that's also where you can find happiness. Let me ask you about love and friendship. Sure.

2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:41.440
 What's the role in this heck of a difficult journey you have been on of love, of friendship?

2:38:41.440 --> 2:38:48.000
 What's the role of love in the human condition? Well, first things first, the woman I married,

2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:53.680
 my wife, Nicole, there's no way I could do what I do if we weren't together.

2:38:53.680 --> 2:38:57.600
 She had the filter idea. Yeah, exactly. We didn't go over that story.

2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:04.640
 Everything is a partnership, right? And to achieve great things. It's not about someone

2:39:04.640 --> 2:39:09.600
 pulling their weight in places. It's not like someone supporting you so that you could do

2:39:09.600 --> 2:39:18.800
 this other thing. It's literally like Mike and I and our partnership as cofounders is fascinating

2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:23.520
 because I don't think Instagram would have happened without that partnership. Either him

2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:30.800
 or me alone, no way. We pushed and pulled each other in a way that allowed us to build a better

2:39:30.800 --> 2:39:36.080
 thing because of it. Nicole, she pushed me to work on the filters early on. And yes,

2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:42.320
 that's exciting. It's a fun story, right? But the truth of it is being able to level with someone

2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:49.920
 about how hard the process is and have someone see you for who you are before Instagram and know

2:39:49.920 --> 2:39:54.800
 that there's a constant you throughout all of this and be able to call you when you're drifting

2:39:54.800 --> 2:40:02.480
 from that, but also support you when you're trying to stick with that. That's true friendship slash

2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:08.480
 love, whatever you want to call it. But also for someone not to care, I remember Nicole saying,

2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:12.720
 hey, I know you're going to do this Instagram thing. I guess it was bourbon at the time.

2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:18.560
 You should do it because even if it doesn't work, we can move to a smaller apartment

2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:23.440
 and it'll be fine. We'll make it work. How beautiful is that, right?

2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:28.000
 Yeah. That's almost like a superpower. It gives you permission to fail and somehow

2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:33.360
 that actually leads to success. But also, she's the least impressed about Instagram of anyone.

2:40:33.360 --> 2:40:37.680
 She's like, yeah, it's great, but I love you for you. I like that you're a decent cook.

2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:42.560
 That's beautiful. It's beautiful with the Gantt chart and thanks again,

2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:45.120
 which I still think is a brilliant, deafing idea. Thank you.

2:40:46.240 --> 2:40:52.240
 Big ridiculous question. Have you, you're old and wise at the stage,

2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:57.200
 so have you discovered meaning to this whole thing? Why the hell are we descendants of

2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:01.840
 apes here on earth? What's the meaning of it? What's the meaning of life?

2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:11.760
 I haven't. The best learning for me has been no matter what level of success you achieve,

2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:16.560
 you're still worried about similar things, maybe on a slightly different scale. You're still

2:41:16.560 --> 2:41:24.320
 concerned about the same things. You're still self conscious about the same things. Actually,

2:41:24.320 --> 2:41:30.080
 that moment going through that is what makes you believe there's got to be more machinery

2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:35.680
 to life or purpose to life. We're all chasing these materialistic things, but you start

2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:41.920
 realizing it's almost like the Truman Show when he gets the edge and he knocks against it.

2:41:41.920 --> 2:41:47.120
 It's like, what? There's this awakening that happens when you get to that edge that you

2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:52.800
 realize, oh, sure, it's great that we all chase money and fame and success,

2:41:53.520 --> 2:41:58.480
 but you hit the edge and I'm not even claiming I hit an edge like Elon's hit an edge. There's

2:41:58.480 --> 2:42:04.000
 clearly larger scales, but what's cool is you learn that it doesn't actually matter and that

2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:09.120
 there are all these other things that truly matter. That's not a case for working less hard,

2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:15.040
 that's not a case for taking it easy, that's not a case for the four day work. What that is a case

2:42:15.040 --> 2:42:21.040
 for is designing your life exactly the way you want to design it because I don't know. I think

2:42:21.040 --> 2:42:28.000
 we go around the Sun a certain number of times and then we die and then that's it. That's me.

2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:29.680
 CB – Are you afraid of that moment?

2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:39.920
 No, not at all. In fact, at least not yet. Listen, I'm like a pilot. I do crazy things and I'm like,

2:42:41.200 --> 2:42:50.560
 no, if anything, I'm like, oh, I got to choose mindfully and purposefully the thing I am doing

2:42:50.560 --> 2:42:55.680
 right now and not just fall into it because you're going to wake up one day and ask yourself,

2:42:55.680 --> 2:43:02.480
 why the hell you spent the last 10 years doing X, Y, or Z? I guess my shorter answer to this is

2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:11.520
 doing things on purpose because you choose to do them so important in life and not just floating

2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:16.000
 down the river of life, hitting branches along the way because you will hit branches,

2:43:16.960 --> 2:43:22.240
 but rather literally plotting a course and not having a 10 year plan, but just choosing every

2:43:22.240 --> 2:43:31.440
 day to opt in. I haven't figured out the meaning of life by any stretch of the imagination,

2:43:31.440 --> 2:43:35.040
 but it certainly isn't money and it certainly isn't fame and it certainly isn't travel and

2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:39.040
 it's way more of opting into the game you love playing.

2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:41.520
 CB – Every day, opting in.

2:43:41.520 --> 2:43:45.440
 CB – Just opting in. Don't let it happen. You opt in.

2:43:45.440 --> 2:43:53.280
 CB – Kevin, it's great to end on the love and the meaning of life. This is an amazing

2:43:53.280 --> 2:44:00.080
 conversation. You gave me light into some fascinating aspects of this technical world

2:44:00.080 --> 2:44:04.640
 and I can't honestly wait to see what you do next. Thank you so much.

2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:05.920
 CB – Thanks for having me.

2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:11.760
 CB – Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kevin Systrom. To support this podcast,

2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:17.440
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you some words from Kevin,

2:44:17.440 --> 2:44:25.280
 Systrom himself. Focusing on one thing and doing it really, really well can get you very far.

2:44:25.280 --> 2:44:41.760
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
