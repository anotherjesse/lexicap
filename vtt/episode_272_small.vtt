WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
 I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.

00:03.460 --> 00:05.820
 I was in Las Vegas, Nevada one day.

00:05.820 --> 00:09.360
 I had stolen the night before I had stolen 160 K out of ATMs.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.700
 Went in the next, the next morning I woke up signed on to cartersmarket.com,

00:14.700 --> 00:16.780
 which was ran by max butler, the ice man.

00:17.080 --> 00:20.280
 Um, and there's my name, us most wanted on it.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.320
 And, uh, that gets your attention.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.460
 It was my real name with us most wanted beside of it.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.960
 Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all, but then they did.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.240
 And it was talking about me being part of the secret service.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.680
 Operation angler fish, everything else.

00:36.440 --> 00:39.720
 So of course they're all, they're all like, everybody's after you like, oh, yeah,

00:40.040 --> 00:41.320
 we're going to get this son of a bitch.

00:43.680 --> 00:48.000
 The following is a conversation with Brett Johnson, a former cyber criminal who

00:48.000 --> 00:51.720
 built the first organized cyber crime community called shadow crew.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.600
 That is the precursor to today's dark net and dark net markets.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.040
 He's referred to by the United States secret service as quote, the original

01:00.040 --> 01:01.120
 internet godfather.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.640
 He has been the central figure in a cyber crime world for almost 20 years.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.360
 Placed on the U S most wanted list in 2006, before being convicted of 39 felonies

01:12.360 --> 01:17.000
 for cyber crime, escaped from prison and then eventually being locked up,

01:17.160 --> 01:22.840
 served his time and now is helping people understand and fight cyber crime.

01:22.840 --> 01:27.280
 This was a raw, honest, emotional, and real episode.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.120
 Brett has caused a lot of pain to a lot of people.

01:31.560 --> 01:38.080
 And yet his own story is full of trauma and pain and also redemption and love.

01:39.240 --> 01:43.840
 This is a good time to say that I have, and I will talk to people who have

01:43.840 --> 01:48.640
 served time in prison and perhaps people who currently are in prison.

01:48.640 --> 01:52.560
 I will try to do my best to both empathize with the person across from

01:52.560 --> 01:57.840
 me and not let them sugarcoat, explain away or dismiss the crimes they committed.

01:58.760 --> 02:02.920
 This is a tough line to walk because if you close your heart to the other person,

02:03.160 --> 02:05.880
 you'll never fully understand their mind and their story.

02:06.560 --> 02:11.240
 But if you open the heart too much, you can be manipulated to where the

02:11.240 --> 02:14.880
 conversation reveals nothing honest or real.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.120
 This requires skill and willingness to take the risk.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.200
 I don't know about the skill part, but I'd like to take the risk.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.480
 I always wear my heart on my sleeve.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.320
 If I get hurt for it, that's life.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.880
 As I've said, I want to understand what makes a person do these crimes,

02:31.920 --> 02:36.880
 the particular characteristics of their temporary or permanent madness,

02:37.440 --> 02:40.320
 their justifications, but also their humanity.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.920
 I believe each of us have the capacity to become both the criminal and the victim,

02:45.360 --> 02:47.120
 the predator and the prey.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.040
 It's up to us to avoid these paths or to find the path to redemption.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.800
 It's on each of us.

02:54.440 --> 03:01.000
 It's our responsibility and burden of being human in a complicated and dangerous world.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.080
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

03:04.120 --> 03:07.520
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description and

03:07.520 --> 03:11.080
 now, dear friends, here's Brett Johnson.

03:12.120 --> 03:18.200
 You were convicted of 39 felonies for cybercrime placed on the US Most Wanted List

03:18.200 --> 03:21.240
 in 2006, escaped from prison.

03:21.760 --> 03:25.360
 You built the first organized cybercrime community called Shadow Crew.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.480
 That is the precursor to today's dark net and dark net markets.

03:29.920 --> 03:34.760
 And for all this, the US intelligence service called you the original

03:34.760 --> 03:41.960
 internet godfather. So first question, how did your career as a cybercrime criminal begin?

03:42.200 --> 03:44.240
 My life of crime begins when I'm 10 years old.

03:44.960 --> 03:45.880
 10 years old, man.

03:45.880 --> 03:46.520
 Think about that.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.680
 I mean, you were probably playing the robots when you were 10, you know,

03:49.680 --> 03:54.160
 usually kids are doing the Lego bit, getting involved with sports, everything else.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.000
 And with me, it wasn't like that.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.040
 With me, I'm from Eastern Kentucky.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.440
 Eastern Kentucky is one of these, um,

04:01.440 --> 04:06.240
 it's like parts of Texas, parts of Louisiana, that if you're not fortunate enough,

04:06.240 --> 04:11.040
 have a job, you may be involved in a scam, hustle, fraud, whatever you want to call it, man.

04:11.040 --> 04:18.000
 I was, uh, my parents, my mom was basically the captain of the entire fraud industry.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.520
 So, uh, this is a, this is a woman that at one point, she's stealing a 108,000

04:23.520 --> 04:27.360
 pound Caterpillar D nine bulldozer, tramming it down the road, you know,

04:27.360 --> 04:31.440
 at another point, she's taking a slip and falling to a convenience store trying to sue the owner.

04:31.760 --> 04:32.880
 We had a neighbor.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.880
 She acted as a pimp for at one point.

04:34.880 --> 04:35.840
 That's my mom.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.240
 Uh, my dad, wait, wait.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.600
 The neighbor acted as a pimp.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.360
 My mom prostituted.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.360
 I mean, she, she acted as a pimp for a neighbor.

04:45.360 --> 04:50.400
 Um, her name was Debbie and, uh, my mom used to sell her out.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.440
 You know, Debbie needed money and my mom would find men for her to slip and

04:54.440 --> 04:58.600
 you know, Debbie needed money and my mom would find men for her to sleep with for cash.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.440
 And she'd take a, a part of the cash.

05:00.440 --> 05:06.840
 So Son is like, she diversified the methodologies by which she, uh, hustled.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.640
 Very bad, that entrepreneurial spirit.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.120
 Okay.

05:10.120 --> 05:14.600
 You know, we, we, we see that a lot with, with cyber criminals, you know, that,

05:14.600 --> 05:16.600
 that sense of being that entrepreneur.

05:16.600 --> 05:21.560
 So what was the motivation you think for her is that, uh, is it money?

05:21.560 --> 05:27.000
 Money is it basically the, uh, the rush of playing with the system of being able to,

05:27.000 --> 05:31.960
 um, know the rules and break the rules and get away with it.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.720
 My mom's a complex character.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.040
 She has, there's no one single motivation.

05:36.040 --> 05:39.240
 So my mom was the individual, she's still alive.

05:39.240 --> 05:43.560
 My mom was the individual who tested people.

05:43.560 --> 05:49.000
 She wanted to know how far she could abuse you and you come back and still love her.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.120
 So, and that was with every relationship she's ever had.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.920
 Um, she would cheat on the men she was involved with.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.960
 She would abuse the, uh, her children, me and Denise.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.160
 She would, uh, uh, psychological, physical.

06:01.160 --> 06:06.360
 Oh, it was mental, emotional, physical, um, everything, everything.

06:06.360 --> 06:11.720
 I mean, she, uh, she used to beat me and Denise with, uh, with belt buckles, you know, and

06:11.720 --> 06:16.760
 that ended when, uh, she was, I forgot what we had done.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.000
 It wasn't much.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.920
 I think that, uh, um, it may have been the part where she, she accused me of stealing

06:24.920 --> 06:29.160
 her marijuana, but, uh, she was hitting me and Denise.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.600
 We were living in a single wide trailer at that point.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.720
 She was hitting me and Denise.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.800
 We were, we were on the bed trying to get away from it.

06:35.800 --> 06:40.680
 And Denise kicks her through a closet is what happens.

06:40.680 --> 06:44.680
 And, uh, Denise stands up and she said, uh, you're through hitting me.

06:44.680 --> 06:49.320
 And that was the last time that mom hit us at that point, but, um,

06:49.320 --> 06:50.840
 So sorry to take us there.

06:50.840 --> 06:55.560
 You're, uh, for people who know you and people should definitely watch some of your lectures

06:55.560 --> 07:01.880
 online, you're extremely charismatic and fun and, uh, jolly and whatever word you want to use.

07:01.880 --> 07:07.080
 But, you know, if we look at that kind of life, it's, there's darkness there.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.160
 There's, uh, struggle there.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.240
 There's a lot of darkness.

07:11.240 --> 07:20.280
 So if you, if you, how did you feel if you go back to the mind of the kid you were with your mom, was,

07:20.280 --> 07:23.400
 uh, was there sadness?

07:23.400 --> 07:28.520
 Was there things like depression, self doubt, all those kinds of things?

07:28.520 --> 07:33.480
 Or did you see this crime, this chaos is ultimately exciting?

07:33.480 --> 07:37.000
 You know, I don't think, uh, back then I didn't view it as exciting.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
 Now it becomes exciting when I start being involved in cyber crime, cyber crime.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.400
 All right, but back then it was simply a means to an end was all it was.

07:45.400 --> 07:50.120
 So you take a 10 year old kid and the way I get involved in crime is like I said,

07:50.120 --> 07:51.400
 my mom was the fraudster.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
 My dad was, my dad was a good guy.

07:53.400 --> 07:58.280
 He just forgot he was this good guy and he was always, he always had these principles,

07:58.280 --> 08:02.360
 but his issue was, is he loved my mom so much.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.200
 He was scared of her leaving.

08:04.760 --> 08:09.560
 So if she wanted to do something, commit crime, cheat on him, whatever,

08:09.560 --> 08:11.560
 he would pretty much just put up with it.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.560
 Um, the, the one instant.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.560
 So, I mean, this woman used to, she used to bring men home in front of him.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.960
 Tell him that, Hey, I'm leaving you.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.160
 I don't love you anymore.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.160
 I want you to die, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.360
 This was my mom.

08:25.560 --> 08:31.160
 Um, there were two instances where the man, where he can't take it anymore.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.160
 And the first instance, I was, I guess I was seven or eight.

08:35.160 --> 08:37.560
 My sister Denise is a year younger than I am.

08:37.560 --> 08:41.560
 My dad actually files for divorce, files for divorce at that point.

08:41.560 --> 08:43.560
 My mom, um, kind of goes crazy.

08:43.560 --> 08:45.560
 Uh, my dad, I was with my dad.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.560
 My, my sister was with my mother because that's that Eastern Kentucky mentality.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.560
 You know, men stay with men, women stay with women.

08:51.560 --> 08:56.560
 So, um, he was filing for divorce.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.560
 Me and my dad, we were living in an apartment.

08:59.560 --> 09:05.560
 My mom was living with, uh, with her grandparents and with her parents bouncing back and forth between the two.

09:05.560 --> 09:07.560
 And I remember I was sleeping in the bed.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.560
 We had a single wide bed.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.560
 My dad slept on the sofa.

09:10.560 --> 09:14.560
 I woke up one night and there was some sort of ruckus in the living room.

09:14.560 --> 09:20.560
 So I wake up and I walk into the living room and my mom has a knife to my dad's throat.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.560
 And basically you're not going to steal my son from me.

09:23.560 --> 09:30.560
 My mom was this individual that when she knew she went so far, like I said, she was always this person that tested.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.560
 Well, can I do this to you and you'll still come back?

09:35.560 --> 09:45.560
 She knew she was always also this person that if she went too far, she knew it and she would always try to divert that into something else.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.560
 All right.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.560
 So she knew at that point she'd went too far.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.560
 So what does she do?

09:49.560 --> 09:59.560
 She gets up crying, goes to the bathroom and pretends to slit her wrists so that my dad Ray will respond to that, not responding.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.560
 To what she's just done to him.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.560
 That was my mom in a nutshell.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.560
 She had a history of doing this kind of stuff.

10:06.560 --> 10:13.560
 Motivations as far as fraud with her, I think with her it was she was an LPN.

10:13.560 --> 10:20.560
 She had a very good nurse, but she didn't want to work was a lot of it.

10:20.560 --> 10:24.560
 So with her, it was easier for her to commit fraud.

10:24.560 --> 10:29.560
 And when I say commit fraud, it was against businesses, against people.

10:29.560 --> 10:38.560
 I remember at one point she's buying over the counter capsules and emptying the capsules out and putting some other crap in there and selling it at a speed and people are buying it.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.560
 She did anything she could for money.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.560
 And of course, I get involved with that.

10:42.560 --> 10:52.560
 What happens is we were in Panama City at that point and my mom leaves my dad and the way she left my dad.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.560
 My great grandfather had died.

10:55.560 --> 11:02.560
 My mom tells all three of us, hey, I'm taking the kids and we're going back to Eastern Kentucky to attend the funeral.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.560
 Well, that was her leaving.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.560
 Me and Denise didn't know she didn't pack any of our clothes at all.

11:07.560 --> 11:16.560
 She stows her clothes in the trunk of the car and she leaves my dad and I don't get to see my dad again for I think five, six years or something like that.

11:16.560 --> 11:22.560
 My mom, like I said, she used to bring men home in front of my dad, he'd sit there and cry and beg her not to do it.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.560
 She'd do it anyway.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.560
 When she leaves him, she kept up that.

11:27.560 --> 11:31.560
 So we were living at my grandparents house.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.560
 My grandfather, he had converted the house.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.560
 He had raised the house up and built apartments underneath of it.

11:36.560 --> 11:44.560
 So me and my sister and my mom lived in one of the apartments underneath and that whole side of the family was just nuts.

11:44.560 --> 11:48.560
 My granddad, Paul, he would.

11:48.560 --> 11:55.560
 This is a man that he didn't want you to eat any of his food.

11:55.560 --> 11:59.560
 So there was no such thing as me and Denise going upstairs to eat.

11:59.560 --> 12:09.560
 If he found out me and Denise was taking a bath, we were allowed to bath and bathe in two inches of water one time a week because he didn't want to have to pay the water bill.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.560
 There's rules.

12:10.560 --> 12:11.560
 There are rules.

12:11.560 --> 12:17.560
 You know, if you couldn't have the TV on, when he went to bed at night, you had to have the television, the volume.

12:17.560 --> 12:26.560
 You could watch it, but without volume because if he heard it, he would, he would get up in the middle of the night and he would kick the power breaker, turn off all the power on you.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.560
 This is my, this is my, the family, right?

12:28.560 --> 12:34.560
 So my mom, she used to leave me and Denise at home for days, man, for days.

12:34.560 --> 12:40.560
 She'd go out and, you know, party and I mean, sometimes she'd take me to Denise with her.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.560
 She'd wait in the car.

12:41.560 --> 12:45.560
 Sometimes we'd wait in the living room as she went and partied and everything else.

12:45.560 --> 12:52.560
 Most of the time she left, left us at home and my entry into crime, Denise walks in one day.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.560
 She's, she's nine years old, man.

12:54.560 --> 12:59.560
 She walks in one day and she's got a pack of pork chops in her hand and looked at her and I said, where'd you get that?

12:59.560 --> 13:01.560
 And she's like, I stole it.

13:01.560 --> 13:04.560
 And, you know, it's like, show me how you did that.

13:04.560 --> 13:08.560
 So she takes me over and she shows me how she steals food, how she's stuffing it down her pants.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.560
 So we start stealing food.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.560
 I'm like, hell yeah, let's do that shit.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.560
 So start stealing food and we get to the point where we're wanting a sandwich.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.560
 Well, you can't stuff a loaf of bread down your pants.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.560
 So there was a Kmart in the shopping center.

13:20.560 --> 13:27.560
 I go over to the Kmart, get a hoodie off the, off the rack, take the tags off of it, wear it out, work just fine.

13:27.560 --> 13:33.560
 And the way you steal bread is you put the hoodie over your shoulder, stuff the loaf of bread down the sleeve and you walk out with it.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.560
 So we started doing that.

13:35.560 --> 13:36.560
 How'd you figure that out?

13:36.560 --> 13:37.560
 Just thought pattern.

13:37.560 --> 13:43.560
 So there's like, strategic thinking here.

13:43.560 --> 13:48.560
 Yeah, you know, you can't wear the hoodie and put the bread down here because you might mash the bread when you zip it up.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.560
 Yeah, we have to think through that.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560
 You got to think through it.

13:51.560 --> 13:56.560
 But you got to realize that by this point, I'm, hell, I'm already seeing what my parents are doing.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.560
 You know, I'm already seeing.

13:58.560 --> 14:03.560
 So that kind of puzzle solving was something you were already developing yourself in division because you're pretty young.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.560
 Yeah, 10 years old, pretty young.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.560
 But seeing how they act, how they respond to things.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.560
 And my mom, I guess you could call it a good thing.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.560
 They never kept any of that hidden from the kids.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.560
 You know, there was no discussions behind closed doors.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.560
 All that happened in front of everybody.

14:19.560 --> 14:29.560
 And from your young minds perspective, seeing that kind of crime, you basically, you know, a lot of us kind of grow up thinking there's rules you're not supposed to break.

14:29.560 --> 14:34.560
 If you see other humans breaking those rules, then you realize those rules are just human made.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.560
 But it gets worse than that.

14:36.560 --> 14:41.560
 I was in an environment where there were no decent people.

14:41.560 --> 14:46.560
 I didn't really meet my first decent person until I was 16 years old.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.560
 Who's that?

14:47.560 --> 14:49.560
 That was a high school teacher.

14:49.560 --> 14:53.560
 So what happens is, is, you know, we start shoplifting food.

14:53.560 --> 14:58.560
 My mom finds out that we've been stealing stuff and, you know, she joins us.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.560
 What's that?

14:59.560 --> 15:00.560
 She joins us.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.560
 Yeah, she comes in.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.560
 You know, I've got the television, I've got the Atari 2600 play the hell out of it.

15:05.560 --> 15:06.560
 Oh my God.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.560
 She starts seeing this shit.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.560
 She's like, where'd this come from?

15:08.560 --> 15:09.560
 And I'm like, well, we found it.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.560
 She's like, you need to find that Denise.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.560
 Denise stands up.

15:12.560 --> 15:13.560
 We stole it.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.560
 My mom showed me how you did that.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.560
 And she gets her mom too to join in.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.560
 And she used to run me and Denise as these little shoplifters.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.560
 We'd take, you know, we'd steal stuff for her.

15:24.560 --> 15:30.560
 We would distract security and her and my grandmother would steal stuff.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.560
 They got caught doing that.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.560
 But that's the entry into crime.

15:34.560 --> 15:40.560
 And Denise, you know, I'm adamant and I kind of mean it.

15:40.560 --> 15:48.560
 But the truth is, I say, and I do mean it that I'm responsible for my choices as an adult.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.560
 All right.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.560
 I believe that when you're a child, you can't control that.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.560
 The adults in your environment control what you do.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.560
 All right.

15:55.560 --> 15:58.560
 Once you're an adult, though, your choices are yours.

15:58.560 --> 16:10.560
 Now, that being said, there's some, you can't dismiss that childhood influencing what I did as an adult.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.560
 You can't do that.

16:11.560 --> 16:17.560
 I mean, it was kind of written on slate that, hey, this guy's going to beat this guy when he grows up.

16:17.560 --> 16:22.560
 That's like sometimes that one person you meet, that decent person can turn the tide into life.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.560
 Absolutely.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.560
 Absolutely.

16:24.560 --> 16:30.560
 And what happens is, you know, the abuse, everything continues on when I'm 15.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.560
 My dad was in Panama City, Florida.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.560
 My mom was in, you know, we were in Hazard, Kentucky.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.560
 She was dating this guy.

16:40.560 --> 16:48.560
 And my mom was this woman that the abuse would, it was crazy abuse, man.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.560
 Just crazy stuff.

16:49.560 --> 16:59.560
 She would tell me and my sister, you know, that she gave up her life for us, that she was going to leave one day and never come back, that we'd find her dead in a ditch someplace.

16:59.560 --> 17:04.560
 She'd go out and date these men and she'd come back and she'd talk about how these men were abusing her.

17:04.560 --> 17:12.560
 You know, so she'd be dating this guy and she'd come back and then she'd, you know, start talking about how he had tried to rape her.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.560
 You know, trying to get me to respond to that.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.560
 And I would respond to that.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.560
 Make no doubt, I would respond to that.

17:17.560 --> 17:23.560
 Well, what happens is, and I knew that, I don't know if I knew it was abuse at that age.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.560
 All right, but I knew things were fucked up.

17:25.560 --> 17:35.560
 And I was talking to my dad in Panama City and I really had it in my head that I was going to go down and live with my dad.

17:35.560 --> 17:40.560
 And I call my dad one day.

17:40.560 --> 17:47.560
 I was set to go to, me and my cousins were going to go see Return of the Jedi and it came out again in the theaters.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.560
 So I called my dad.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.560
 It was a Sunday.

17:49.560 --> 17:56.560
 I called my dad and he told me he had either gotten married or he was about to get married to this woman.

17:56.560 --> 18:00.560
 And basically Brett Johnson wasn't going to go down to Florida.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.560
 You know, I was going to stay in a hazard.

18:02.560 --> 18:16.560
 I had to call my dad from payphone, but the result of that was I walked into a hospital, got in an elevator, and a woman got in the elevator at the same time.

18:16.560 --> 18:20.560
 And I snapped and beat the hell out of her right there.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.560
 And I was 15.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.560
 Didn't really know what the fuck happened.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.560
 Didn't really know.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.560
 But just anger came from someone.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.560
 Yeah, yeah.

18:32.560 --> 18:39.560
 And, you know, the elevator beat the hell out of this lady.

18:39.560 --> 18:43.560
 Turned out she looked a shitload like my mom.

18:43.560 --> 18:49.560
 But the elevator doors open.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.560
 One of the security guards, I played basketball with with his son.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.560
 So he saw me immediately.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.560
 I knocked the hell out of him, took off running, made it back to the house.

18:59.560 --> 19:03.560
 Where my grand parents were, they didn't know what had happened.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.560
 So I didn't say anything.

19:06.560 --> 19:11.560
 About an hour later, Kentucky State Police, they pull up in the front yard.

19:11.560 --> 19:16.560
 And two of them get out and I'm sitting on the front porch and me and my cousins are.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.560
 And they start walking up.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.560
 Everybody starts walking out of the house.

19:19.560 --> 19:21.560
 And I'm like, I just remember saying, what do you want?

19:21.560 --> 19:22.560
 What do you want?

19:22.560 --> 19:23.560
 Well, you know what they wanted.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.560
 They wanted to arrest Brett Johnson.

19:25.560 --> 19:30.560
 And then they arrested me, I went in and I told them everything.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.560
 Spent three months in a county jail.

19:32.560 --> 19:36.560
 They didn't have juvenile facilities in that county.

19:36.560 --> 19:44.560
 So I spent three months in solitary, went to trial, pled guilty to assault the first degree.

19:44.560 --> 19:53.560
 The judge sentenced me to time served and a psychological evaluation where they sent me to Louisville, Kentucky.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.560
 Spent 30 days up there and they cut me loose.

19:55.560 --> 20:02.560
 They wanted me to have counseling after that and never went to counseling.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.560
 You know, I wanted to, but mom was like, don't need it.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.560
 So never went to counseling.

20:08.560 --> 20:15.560
 And I became this pariah in the county.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.560
 It's crazy, man.

20:16.560 --> 20:21.560
 I mean, not a day goes by that I don't think about that.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.560
 That moment in the elevator.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.560
 Yeah.

20:23.560 --> 20:28.560
 And what happens is, you know, you're 15.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.560
 Fuck man, you're 15.

20:30.560 --> 20:37.560
 So I go back to the high school that I was in and I'm this piece of shit.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.560
 So everybody, you're not the outcast.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.560
 Everybody knows.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.560
 So I moved.

20:43.560 --> 20:44.560
 We moved.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.560
 We were in Weizberg at that point.

20:46.560 --> 20:51.560
 I finished up the year there and moved to back to Perry County.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.560
 We're just where hazard is.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.560
 So we moved there and they've got three high schools there.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.560
 They've got MC Napier.

20:58.560 --> 21:02.560
 They've got hazard high school and then they've got Dills Combs High School.

21:02.560 --> 21:10.560
 So I was within, me and Denise were within half mile of MC Napier.

21:10.560 --> 21:16.560
 Show up there the first day of school and I met me and my mom and my sister were walking

21:16.560 --> 21:20.560
 into the school and the kids won't let me in.

21:20.560 --> 21:24.560
 The kids stand out there.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.560
 He's not coming in.

21:26.560 --> 21:30.560
 So my mom starts raising hell and I'm like, no, let's just go.

21:30.560 --> 21:31.560
 Let's go.

21:31.560 --> 21:35.560
 So from there, it was, we went down to the city school hazard and the principal tells

21:35.560 --> 21:38.560
 my mom Denise can come.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.560
 He can't.

21:40.560 --> 21:45.560
 So my mom was to raise hell and I'm like, no, let's just, just take me to this other

21:45.560 --> 21:46.560
 school.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.560
 So this other school was like 15 miles away.

21:48.560 --> 21:55.560
 And you know, country, country school, country high school.

21:55.560 --> 22:04.560
 So I go there and they accept me and I walked in the first day and this English teacher

22:04.560 --> 22:06.560
 names Carol Combs.

22:06.560 --> 22:10.560
 I walked in and handed her the paper.

22:10.560 --> 22:14.560
 She was my homeroom teacher and she heard this voice.

22:14.560 --> 22:24.560
 And she looks up and she was like, son, have you ever done any drama before?

22:24.560 --> 22:29.560
 I'm like, no, ma'm, but I'm interested in the academic team.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.560
 I was this quick recall guy, right?

22:31.560 --> 22:36.560
 And she's like, no, she's like drama.

22:36.560 --> 22:40.560
 I'm like, no, I'm not interested in theater.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.560
 I'm interested in academics.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.560
 I'm the head of the drama department and head of the academics department.

22:45.560 --> 22:52.560
 So the deal was, tell you what, you can get on the academics team if you start with theater

22:52.560 --> 22:53.560
 too.

22:53.560 --> 22:54.560
 And I was like, okay.

22:54.560 --> 22:58.560
 So what happens is she was the only, she was the first decent person I met in my life

22:58.560 --> 23:01.560
 and she became this kind of surrogate mother to me.

23:01.560 --> 23:09.560
 So under her tutelage, I become the one of the top academic team guys in the state.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.560
 I was captain of the team.

23:12.560 --> 23:17.560
 I was just scourge across all the counties in that part of Kentucky.

23:17.560 --> 23:25.560
 If we had a meet, it was like, Jesus Christ, that's Brett Johnson.

23:25.560 --> 23:30.560
 She used to tell people they would, the high school that I came from was Whitesburg and

23:30.560 --> 23:35.560
 the first time that Whitesburg came against us, she told me, and I was talking to her about

23:35.560 --> 23:38.560
 a year ago and she told me, she's like, Brett, she said that first meet against

23:38.560 --> 23:39.560
 Whitesburg.

23:39.560 --> 23:45.560
 She said, the captain came in, looked at you and said, oh, you've got that Johnson boy

23:45.560 --> 23:46.560
 on your team.

23:46.560 --> 23:52.560
 And she said, my response was that Johnson boy is our team.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.560
 So, but I did that.

23:54.560 --> 23:59.560
 And then with theater, I ended up my senior year.

23:59.560 --> 24:03.560
 I was one best actor and actress in the state.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.560
 Only God ever do that in the state.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.560
 So did pretty well, man.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.560
 Did pretty well.

24:08.560 --> 24:13.560
 Had scholarships coming out of high school and everything else and I'm the idiot that

24:13.560 --> 24:14.560
 turned them down.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.560
 That's a funny question.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.560
 Yeah.

24:16.560 --> 24:20.560
 You'd make a hell of a, I mean, of all the many things you could probably do, you would

24:20.560 --> 24:22.560
 make a hell of an actor.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.560
 I'm very good on stage.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.560
 I'm very good on stage.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.560
 Have you acted professionally anywhere?

24:28.560 --> 24:29.560
 Not professionally.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.560
 We've done the college circuit and stuff like that.

24:31.560 --> 24:38.560
 What happened was is, so I turned down the, turned down the scholarships, you know, scared

24:38.560 --> 24:39.560
 of leaving.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.560
 I guess that's what it was.

24:40.560 --> 24:45.560
 Starting community college and the community college there hires a new theater director

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
 out of California.

24:46.560 --> 24:50.560
 Well, he knew the guy that ran the San Jose state theater program.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.560
 Got him.

24:51.560 --> 24:52.560
 Edward Emanuel was his name.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.560
 His claim to fame.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.560
 He had written the three ninjas movie.

24:56.560 --> 24:59.560
 Remember that the three little ninja kids back in the eighties?

24:59.560 --> 25:03.560
 He had written this damn film and it had made a shitload of money.

25:03.560 --> 25:08.560
 So he invites Ed Emanuel to come down and see the play and Ed had written this civil

25:08.560 --> 25:09.560
 war piece.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.560
 So we put that on.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.560
 I was doing like, it was a multiple role thing.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.560
 I was doing like 18 different roles in the show.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.560
 So Ed sees the show and he was like, scholarship.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.560
 He said, look, he said, right now you're a big fish in a small pond.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.560
 We'll make you a big fish in a big pond.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.560
 I was like, deal.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.560
 So I took the scholarship, man.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.560
 And he was like, I'll be back in two weeks.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.560
 So he flies out two weeks later.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.560
 This guy flies back in.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.560
 He drives down to where I'm living.

25:34.560 --> 25:38.560
 I'm out shooting ball with one of my cousins and friends.

25:38.560 --> 25:43.560
 He pulls up and he gets out of the car and I was like, I'm walking over to him.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.560
 I was like, hey, man, I'll walk in.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.560
 You can meet my parents.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.560
 He's like, no, I got it.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.560
 I was like, okay.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.560
 So I keep shooting ball.

25:49.560 --> 25:54.560
 He walks in the house, stays about 15 minutes, walks out.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.560
 Why does a sheet doesn't say a word to me?

25:57.560 --> 25:59.560
 Gets in the car, leaves.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.560
 I don't hear from him again.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.560
 Had no idea what went on.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.560
 It takes me a couple of weeks.

26:05.560 --> 26:09.560
 What happened is my mom, he walks in and introduces himself.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.560
 My mom pulls a knife on the guy.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.560
 I will kill you.

26:13.560 --> 26:16.560
 You are not going to steal my goddamn son from me.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.560
 Scares the guy to death.

26:18.560 --> 26:23.560
 He bugs out and kind of broke my spirit at that point.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.560
 You know, I was like, okay.

26:26.560 --> 26:33.560
 So went into just full fledged into scams, crimes, everything else.

26:33.560 --> 26:39.560
 I had already been, when I was a minor, I'd already been kind of brought up on that side

26:39.560 --> 26:41.560
 of the family with the crimes that they were doing.

26:41.560 --> 26:48.560
 My mom was, you know, drug trafficking, the pimp stuff, illegally mining coal, charity

26:48.560 --> 26:49.560
 fraud.

26:49.560 --> 26:50.560
 Illegally mining coal.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.560
 Yeah, wild petting coal.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.560
 Can you explain that?

26:53.560 --> 26:58.560
 So to properly mine coal, you have to get a permit, all right?

26:58.560 --> 27:01.560
 Eastern Kentucky, a lot of people don't, they can't afford the permits.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.560
 You know, they can, they can get them a piece of equipment.

27:03.560 --> 27:07.560
 You know, you get a dozer or a loader or whatever you're going to get or an auger or what have

27:07.560 --> 27:08.560
 you.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.560
 So you start mining, but you don't get the permit.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.560
 So you don't have to find, do the, you don't have to pay.

27:12.560 --> 27:17.560
 Back then it was like $3,500 for a two acre permit or $5,000 for a two acre permit.

27:17.560 --> 27:21.560
 Let you strip behind the, the, the coal on that, then you have to pay for the reclamation

27:21.560 --> 27:22.560
 on top of that.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.560
 So once you uncover the pit, take the coal out.

27:25.560 --> 27:30.560
 You have to cover back up the pit, sow grass, make sure everything is environmentally friendly.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.560
 Got a silt pond, everything else at that point.

27:32.560 --> 27:36.560
 So the whole idea is you buy an acre of land or some area of land and then you can, there's

27:36.560 --> 27:38.560
 a whole process you're supposed to go through to find.

27:38.560 --> 27:39.560
 Tire process.

27:39.560 --> 27:44.560
 How many people involved in a mining, the smallest number of people required for a mining operation?

27:44.560 --> 27:46.560
 You can do it through four people.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.560
 Okay.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.560
 So you've got your loader operator, you've got your dozer operator.

27:49.560 --> 27:52.560
 You need, you can, you can farm out the trucking to someone.

27:52.560 --> 27:57.560
 If you need that or trucking company, if you need to do that, then you've got your, whoever

27:57.560 --> 27:58.560
 owns the business as well.

27:58.560 --> 28:04.560
 So very few people can run an operation like that and profit fairly well as long as you

28:04.560 --> 28:08.560
 don't have to do the reclamation, all that crap on top of it.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.560
 All right.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.560
 The reclamation gets pretty expensive.

28:10.560 --> 28:16.560
 So if you're uncovering a pit of coal, you know, a pit, so a ton of coal is basically

28:16.560 --> 28:20.560
 about 36 cubic inches is what, what a 2000 pounds of coal weighs.

28:20.560 --> 28:24.560
 If you're an Eastern Kentucky because it's that the weight of the bituminous coal and

28:24.560 --> 28:25.560
 everything.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.560
 The fact that you know this is awesome.

28:28.560 --> 28:33.560
 The fact that you know exactly the volume of a ton of coal.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.560
 I mean, you learn this shit, right?

28:35.560 --> 28:37.560
 Can you rattle this shit off?

28:37.560 --> 28:40.560
 So you uncover the pit and then you've got to sell the pit.

28:40.560 --> 28:44.560
 Well, the thing is, is that where are you going to sell the coal while you sell it to

28:44.560 --> 28:48.560
 these other coal tipples that knows that they're buying the shit illegally.

28:48.560 --> 28:53.560
 So back then a ton of coal was, that'd give you like 36 bucks per ton is what that is.

28:53.560 --> 28:56.560
 And you'd have to go out and you'd, you'd test the BTUs on it.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.560
 You'd take a sample to the lab, test the BTUs.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.560
 You'd take that into the company.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.560
 British thermal unit.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.560
 So you'd test how, what the BTU on the coal was.

29:04.560 --> 29:05.560
 How pure the coal is.

29:05.560 --> 29:06.560
 How pure the coal is.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.560
 What, what, what BTU it burns at.

29:08.560 --> 29:13.560
 And back then a good, a good BTU was around 12, nine was what you'd get.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.560
 So 12, nine coal, $36 a ton.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.560
 You'd take that sample over to the, to the coal tipple.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.560
 They'd say, okay, we'll buy this for you.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.560
 How many trucks you got or how many tons you got?

29:23.560 --> 29:24.560
 And you say, this is what we've got.

29:24.560 --> 29:28.560
 Then you'd hire the trucking company and where you get it out because, you know,

29:28.560 --> 29:33.560
 you've got the agents that are, that are looking for you by this point because the people that,

29:33.560 --> 29:37.560
 you know, you've, you've, you've bought the rights to whoever the landowner is.

29:37.560 --> 29:40.560
 You said you're going to give them, you know, $2 a ton or whatever this is.

29:40.560 --> 29:44.560
 Well, the other people there, are you paying them off or are you not?

29:44.560 --> 29:46.560
 Well, if you're not paying them off, guess what?

29:46.560 --> 29:49.560
 They know your ass is mining it illegally.

29:49.560 --> 29:50.560
 They're going to report you.

29:50.560 --> 29:53.560
 Well, all of a sudden you've got all these inspectors that are coming around

29:53.560 --> 29:55.560
 and everything that, hey, we know what you're doing.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.560
 So they're looking for you to get the pit out.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.560
 So when do you get the pit out?

29:58.560 --> 29:59.560
 Right in dead of night.

29:59.560 --> 30:03.560
 So, you know, you're loaded up two o clock in the morning, hauling this ass out is what

30:03.560 --> 30:04.560
 you're doing.

30:04.560 --> 30:05.560
 You sell it out from there.

30:05.560 --> 30:08.560
 So, and your mom ran operations like this.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.560
 Yeah.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.560
 And you said you worked the mine too when you were younger?

30:11.560 --> 30:12.560
 Yeah.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.560
 Learned how to run a loader, run a dozer, learned how to clean off a pit.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.560
 Everything like that.

30:17.560 --> 30:21.560
 So this is, this is the lifestyle you, you grow up in.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.560
 You know, you learn how to do this stuff.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.560
 And so knew how to do charity fraud as well.

30:26.560 --> 30:27.560
 Insurance fraud.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.560
 So charity fraud.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.560
 Can we, can we break down some of these are charity fraud?

30:32.560 --> 30:34.560
 It's much more romantic than what it sounds.

30:34.560 --> 30:40.560
 It was basically, it was basically standing beside the road with a sign and a bucket.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.560
 Yeah.

30:41.560 --> 30:46.560
 Taking up collections for homeless shelters, for abused women, for children, stuff like

30:46.560 --> 30:47.560
 that.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.560
 Then later on I branched off.

30:49.560 --> 30:54.560
 When I started off on my own, I would set up my own charity company and do some telemarketing

30:54.560 --> 30:56.560
 and go on by and collect checks and things like that.

30:56.560 --> 31:01.560
 You know, we're going to talk about that, but actually can we just step back and talk

31:01.560 --> 31:10.560
 about your mom, your dad, given all of that, given all the abuse, the complex ways that

31:10.560 --> 31:15.560
 she played with love, to see how far she can push you and the people around her.

31:15.560 --> 31:18.560
 And they still love her today.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.560
 Do you love her?

31:20.560 --> 31:22.560
 You know, I called my dad yesterday.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.560
 My dad, he's, he's dying now.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.560
 He's got a heart condition.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.560
 He's not going to get the operation to fix it.

31:27.560 --> 31:28.560
 So he's like, fuck it.

31:28.560 --> 31:29.560
 I'm ready to go.

31:29.560 --> 31:34.560
 I looked at him because hell, I'm 52 now and prior to 52, I'd have been like, no, you

31:34.560 --> 31:35.560
 need to do this.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.560
 But I looked at him and I was like, I understand.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.560
 I understand.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.560
 You're done.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.560
 And so he's not going to get the operation.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.560
 I was talking to him yesterday and he asked me, he's like, have you seen your mom?

31:45.560 --> 31:48.560
 And I was like, dad, I'm not talking to you for about two years.

31:48.560 --> 31:54.560
 And I told him, I was like, I love my mom, but my mom is not a good person.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.560
 She's not.

31:55.560 --> 32:00.060
 And he told me, I was talking to him on the phone yesterday and he told me that it took

32:00.060 --> 32:05.560
 him several years to really understand that, you know, he loved her too, but it takes,

32:05.560 --> 32:08.560
 when you're, when you're getting an abuse like that, especially my dad, my dad came

32:08.560 --> 32:13.560
 from a good family, everything else and, you know, upstanding family.

32:13.560 --> 32:20.400
 And I think that when you're that victim of abuse, you know, you've never seen it before.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.560
 You've never encountered it.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.560
 And then it happens.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.360
 Well, you're like that frog and water all of a sudden.

32:25.360 --> 32:30.360
 You know, you get to the point where gradually increases until how do you get out of it?

32:30.360 --> 32:32.760
 Everybody else sees what's happening, but you don't.

32:32.760 --> 32:38.320
 I grew up in that environment though, you know, so it took me a long time to come to

32:38.320 --> 32:39.320
 terms with that.

32:39.320 --> 32:43.400
 And my sister came to terms with it long before I did, you know, my sister, she, she's been

32:43.400 --> 32:47.160
 a decade without talking to my mom, like she had tried to commit suicide.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.520
 I didn't know that.

32:48.520 --> 32:55.480
 What got me so bad is she said at one point that she always thought someone was going

32:55.480 --> 32:59.720
 to come in and save us and my response and just immediate response, not even thinking

32:59.720 --> 33:00.720
 about it.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.880
 My response was, well, Denise, I knew no one ever was.

33:03.880 --> 33:11.680
 And looking at things now, I think that's the, that's where our paths diverged.

33:11.680 --> 33:15.960
 Me it was, if you want to do it, if anybody's going to take care of you, you got to take

33:15.960 --> 33:16.960
 care of yourself.

33:16.960 --> 33:17.960
 You're on your own.

33:17.960 --> 33:18.960
 You're on your own.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.320
 You know, it's up to you.

33:21.320 --> 33:26.840
 And Denise has always been that, that, that child that has expected someone to come in

33:26.840 --> 33:27.840
 and save her.

33:27.840 --> 33:31.400
 Well, and almost like it's all going to be okay.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.400
 Somebody.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.400
 Yeah.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.400
 And I knew it wasn't.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.400
 And no, no, you go.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.400
 Unless you.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.400
 Unless you make it okay.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.400
 It ain't going to be okay.

33:39.400 --> 33:46.240
 So, you know, I was, are you able to forgive her, your mom?

33:46.240 --> 33:50.240
 My boundary with my mom, the reason I've not spoken with her.

33:50.240 --> 33:55.760
 Over two years ago, I started this, this legal career of mine.

33:55.760 --> 34:02.160
 I've been the guy who has, I spent a lot of time thinking about my past and those choices

34:02.160 --> 34:04.360
 and what brought, brought those choices around.

34:04.360 --> 34:06.760
 So I'm big about taking responsibility for my actions.

34:06.760 --> 34:07.760
 I truly am.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.360
 I think it's really important you have to do that.

34:09.360 --> 34:12.680
 Well, my mom, not so much.

34:12.680 --> 34:17.360
 So I was talking to her, you know, and I, I would start saying, you know, she was,

34:17.360 --> 34:21.040
 she would start the conversation talking about, she didn't understand why Denise wouldn't

34:21.040 --> 34:22.040
 speak to her anymore.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.400
 That was one of her tropes.

34:24.400 --> 34:30.000
 So in my response, started to become, well, because you were the abuser and you spent

34:30.000 --> 34:31.200
 your life doing that to her.

34:31.200 --> 34:34.440
 So it's more healthy for her not to talk to you.

34:34.440 --> 34:40.160
 So she's still not able to see the flaws in, in her ways of the past.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.280
 No, not at all.

34:41.280 --> 34:48.040
 So my, my ultimatum to my mom was, look, when you're able to admit that you abuse the people

34:48.040 --> 34:54.880
 in your life, accept that responsibility and be able to discuss it with me, we'll have

34:54.880 --> 34:55.880
 a talk.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.700
 Other than that, I don't want to talk to you anymore.

34:58.700 --> 35:05.080
 So for the first year, it was, you know, calling, cussing my wife out, cussing me out.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.980
 You know, I don't need you out, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

35:07.980 --> 35:11.880
 And then finally it started to taper off and she's never really contacted me after that

35:11.880 --> 35:15.200
 point.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.200
 Your dad is dying.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.360
 What do you take from the way he's taken on death?

35:21.360 --> 35:23.040
 Just saying, fuck it.

35:23.040 --> 35:27.880
 You know, it's the man and what have you learned from your dad?

35:27.880 --> 35:30.280
 What do you love about your dad?

35:30.280 --> 35:35.800
 He's one of these guys that, you know, like I told him, I told my dad about the, about

35:35.800 --> 35:39.200
 the abuse and everything else and there was a point.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.320
 So you know, I told you about the elevator stuff.

35:41.320 --> 35:48.560
 But before that, man, it was, it took me 40 years to talk about that, but it also took

35:48.560 --> 35:58.960
 me 40 years to, to talk about, there was a point that my mom and dad would leave the

35:58.960 --> 36:04.720
 house and I would urinate in the floor, all right?

36:04.720 --> 36:14.160
 And there's a, like out of anger, no, no idea why, all right, but I would piss on the carpet.

36:14.160 --> 36:18.040
 Carpet business like the little Bowsky, right?

36:18.040 --> 36:20.120
 It really tied the room together.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.080
 It really tied the room together.

36:22.080 --> 36:26.640
 I was talking about that and this lady comes up to me after the, after the presentation

36:26.640 --> 36:32.000
 and she had, she had a career previous to that where she dealt with abused kids and

36:32.000 --> 36:37.320
 she told me, she's like, Brett, she's like, it's a control mechanism.

36:37.320 --> 36:42.320
 The only control you had was that and she's like, kids do that.

36:42.320 --> 36:43.640
 And I was like, so I'm not unique.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.880
 She's like, no, you're not unique in that.

36:45.880 --> 36:52.680
 So that, you know, this whole history of abuse, Denise dealt with it by drinking, by trying

36:52.680 --> 36:55.240
 to commit suicide, things like that.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.360
 And then finally she escapes.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.360
 I'm the kid that didn't.

36:57.360 --> 37:01.960
 And not only that, my wife pointed out to me that it's again, it's that Eastern Kentucky

37:01.960 --> 37:05.000
 mentality stuff, you know, the males expected to do things.

37:05.000 --> 37:12.200
 So with, with me, it was, it was almost like I stepped up to, to take part in those crimes

37:12.200 --> 37:14.800
 so that Denise didn't, didn't have to.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.720
 And she, she was able to avoid all that other than that one shoplifting stuff, Denise doesn't

37:18.720 --> 37:20.080
 break the law anymore.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.960
 She goes off to be a, she's a, she's a good parent.

37:22.960 --> 37:23.960
 She's an angry parent.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.160
 She's a good parent.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.800
 She's a teacher.

37:26.800 --> 37:27.800
 She's a good citizen overall.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.720
 I was just the guy that kept right on going with it.

37:30.720 --> 37:31.720
 kept on going.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.120
 So let me ask you about that.

37:33.120 --> 37:40.320
 So your life of cyber crime and describing some of the things you did or knew about,

37:40.320 --> 37:45.600
 you said, quote, I once stole several thousand dollars worth of coins from a family trying

37:45.600 --> 37:49.200
 to sell them to put a new roof on their home.

37:49.200 --> 37:55.360
 Another time I sent a counterfeit cashier's check to a victim and he ended up being arrested

37:55.360 --> 37:56.360
 for it.

37:56.360 --> 38:01.320
 I had to family friends, everyone I knew, I was a truly despicable person.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.560
 True.

38:02.560 --> 38:07.840
 One of my Ukrainian associates script had someone who owed him money, kidnapped and

38:07.840 --> 38:09.040
 tortured.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.680
 He posted pictures of it online.

38:11.680 --> 38:17.680
 Another member, Iceman, used to flood his enemy's email addresses with child pornography,

38:17.680 --> 38:19.960
 then called the police on them.

38:19.960 --> 38:20.960
 That's some stories.

38:20.960 --> 38:26.320
 Can you tell some of these stories that stand out to you that are particularly despicable

38:26.320 --> 38:34.520
 or representative or interesting when you look back at that, that defined your approach

38:34.520 --> 38:36.400
 and who you were at that time?

38:36.400 --> 38:41.840
 Let me say that I did not care about my victim, all right?

38:41.840 --> 38:46.000
 I cared about me is what I cared about.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.360
 It's rough to admit that, you know, that you don't give a shit what you're doing anybody

38:51.360 --> 38:52.360
 else.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.360
 You don't care about you.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.360
 But that's the truth of the matter.

38:54.360 --> 38:56.480
 I didn't care about the victims.

38:56.480 --> 39:01.560
 The lady, that was, that wasn't even at the beginning of my career as a cyber criminal.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.200
 That was right at the last of it.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.200
 Which lady?

39:04.200 --> 39:05.200
 The coin lady.

39:05.200 --> 39:10.880
 I was, by that point, Shadow Crew had made the front cover of Forbes, August of 04, October

39:10.880 --> 39:16.840
 26th of 04, Secret Service had shut us down, 33 people, arrested six countries in six hours.

39:16.840 --> 39:20.680
 I was the guy that was publicly mentioned as getting away.

39:20.680 --> 39:26.120
 What happened was is I was the guy who was, I had kind of invented this crime called tax

39:26.120 --> 39:31.160
 return identity theft and was stealing a lot of money.

39:31.160 --> 39:35.440
 I went through all my state side savings and Shadow Crew gets shut down.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.840
 I don't have any way to come in with any money.

39:37.840 --> 39:43.800
 So I start running counterfeit cashiers checks, defrauding people with that, having them send

39:43.800 --> 39:48.400
 products or bullion collections, what have you by COD, collect on delivery and I would

39:48.400 --> 39:51.160
 pay with it with a counterfeit cashiers check.

39:51.160 --> 39:54.120
 This lady was on eBay.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.200
 She had been collecting these silver coins all of her life.

39:57.200 --> 40:00.480
 You know, the US currency used to be the coins used to be silver.

40:00.480 --> 40:05.840
 So she had a whole collection of these things, like I don't know, 80, 90 pounds of this stuff.

40:05.840 --> 40:10.520
 And I'm a very good social engineer.

40:10.520 --> 40:16.080
 So convinced her that I was a legitimate person that, you know, hey, send it to COD.

40:16.080 --> 40:20.440
 You can use my FedEx account to do that, to my UPS account to do that.

40:20.440 --> 40:25.800
 I'll pay with a cashiers check, you can take it in, same as cash.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.800
 She believed that.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.520
 She was even on the ad and we talked on the phone or everything else.

40:30.520 --> 40:36.600
 She had told me that she was a single parent and it was the only money that she had to

40:36.600 --> 40:39.680
 put a roof on the house for her and her kids.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.360
 And I didn't give a damn.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.360
 I didn't give a damn.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.360
 What was more important was me at that point.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.400
 Can I ask you a question about the social engineering aspect?

40:46.400 --> 40:54.200
 So maybe specifics like the methodology, email, you said phone.

40:54.200 --> 41:01.680
 Maybe you could discuss this process from a bigger philosophical perspective of what

41:01.680 --> 41:09.960
 is it about human beings that makes impossible to be social engineer, to be victims of fraud?

41:09.960 --> 41:17.080
 So first let me say that I became a social engineer as a child, all right, because the

41:17.080 --> 41:23.720
 adults in my environment as a child, I had to know exactly what they were thinking and

41:23.720 --> 41:26.640
 be able to try to manipulate that for survival.

41:26.640 --> 41:31.440
 So I became a social engineer for survival initially, all right.

41:31.440 --> 41:35.000
 And one of the things that I've seen with a lot of cyber criminals is the exact same

41:35.000 --> 41:37.600
 thing, the really expert ones.

41:37.600 --> 41:42.280
 They become a social engineer as a child, then later on, they use those tools to victimize

41:42.280 --> 41:43.280
 others, all right.

41:43.280 --> 41:48.360
 Which is fascinating because in order to understand what others are thinking, you have to be extremely

41:48.360 --> 41:49.360
 good at empathy.

41:49.360 --> 41:55.000
 So you have to like really put yourself in the shoes of the other person, and yet in

41:55.000 --> 42:02.640
 order to do cyber crime, you have to not care about the pain that might cause them once you

42:02.640 --> 42:03.640
 manipulate them.

42:03.640 --> 42:07.200
 So you have to empathize and yet not care.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.200
 Exactly.

42:08.200 --> 42:13.960
 And I would argue that that is not a sociopath because a cyber criminal, and I was no different,

42:13.960 --> 42:16.160
 most cyber criminals justify those actions.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.920
 So the justification becomes what's important.

42:18.920 --> 42:22.760
 With me, the justification was why I did it for my family, did it for my wife, did it

42:22.760 --> 42:24.480
 for my stripper girlfriend.

42:24.480 --> 42:29.640
 So and I believe those just because I care about love a lot.

42:29.640 --> 42:40.160
 So the big picture of that is trust, how do you establish trust with a potential victim,

42:40.160 --> 42:41.160
 all right.

42:41.160 --> 42:46.240
 Now, I would argue online that that trust is established through a combination of technology,

42:46.240 --> 42:48.440
 tools, social engineering, all right.

42:48.440 --> 42:52.760
 So we trust our tech, you know, we trust our cell phones, we trust our laptops.

42:52.760 --> 42:56.200
 A lot of times we don't understand how they operate, but we trust the news that comes

42:56.200 --> 42:57.200
 across the line.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.520
 We trust the phone numbers that show up.

42:59.520 --> 43:04.360
 We trust IP addresses if we're advanced enough to look at an IP address or a domain or anything

43:04.360 --> 43:05.800
 else like that.

43:05.800 --> 43:11.760
 Criminals use tools to manipulate that, spoofed phone numbers, spoofed browser fingerprints,

43:11.760 --> 43:14.280
 whatever that may be, whatever the tool may be.

43:14.280 --> 43:16.640
 Then that lays a base level of trust.

43:16.640 --> 43:21.480
 At that point, you shoot in with the social engineering and lay whatever story that is

43:21.480 --> 43:26.480
 in order to manipulate that victim to act not out of reason, but out of a motion all

43:26.480 --> 43:27.480
 of a sudden.

43:27.480 --> 43:34.040
 This is fascinating about the way humans interact with the world, which is you're almost too

43:34.040 --> 43:35.320
 afraid to not trust the world.

43:35.320 --> 43:36.320
 You have to find a balance.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.320
 Right.

43:37.320 --> 43:42.480
 You have a lot of conspiracy theories now about distrusting institutions and thinking

43:42.480 --> 43:44.080
 like everything around us.

43:44.080 --> 43:50.680
 It's like, I've been listening to people who believe the earth is flat and that conspiracy

43:50.680 --> 43:56.600
 theory is fascinating to me because it basically says that you can't trust anybody.

43:56.600 --> 43:57.440
 Right.

43:57.440 --> 44:00.760
 That like everything you hear is a lie.

44:00.760 --> 44:05.480
 That's one, you can live that life or you can live a life where you're just naively

44:05.480 --> 44:11.640
 trusting everything and we as humans have to, because that life is full of happiness

44:11.640 --> 44:17.560
 if nobody screws you over because you meet people with the joyful heart and you get excited

44:17.560 --> 44:21.680
 and all that kind of stuff, but if you do that too much, you're going to get burned.

44:21.680 --> 44:28.720
 So you have to find some kind of balance in terms of optimizing happiness where you trust,

44:28.720 --> 44:34.360
 I mean, but verify and on the internet that becomes really tricky.

44:34.360 --> 44:37.920
 You're almost too afraid to distrust everything because you'll never get anything done on

44:37.920 --> 44:41.440
 the internet, but then if you trust too much, you can get screwed over.

44:41.440 --> 44:46.680
 And so the social engineering comes in where you're like, I'm not sure if I should trust

44:46.680 --> 44:47.800
 this.

44:47.800 --> 44:51.760
 You kind of help them build the narrative was like, it's good.

44:51.760 --> 44:52.760
 It's good.

44:52.760 --> 44:53.760
 It's good.

44:53.760 --> 44:59.360
 So in a lot of the times that social engineering is just feeding into what the victim wants

44:59.360 --> 45:00.360
 to believe.

45:00.360 --> 45:01.360
 Yeah.

45:01.360 --> 45:02.360
 All right.

45:02.360 --> 45:03.680
 It's not really coming up with a brand new story at all.

45:03.680 --> 45:07.840
 It's just knowing what that victim is, what the motivations of that victim is, feeding

45:07.840 --> 45:09.080
 into it at that point.

45:09.080 --> 45:14.800
 So you have to, again, that social engineer has to almost immediately know what's driving

45:14.800 --> 45:16.920
 that person that they're talking about.

45:16.920 --> 45:19.280
 So I'm working on a phone, talking to someone over the phone.

45:19.280 --> 45:24.000
 I have to know within seconds what I need to say, how I need to act to interact with

45:24.000 --> 45:28.240
 that customer service agent or whoever I'm talking to on the other end of the line.

45:28.240 --> 45:32.240
 So fascinating because you truly are empathizing with the other person.

45:32.240 --> 45:34.240
 What is it?

45:34.240 --> 45:41.360
 This businessman, Stephen Schwarzman, I've talked to a few times, he mentioned this

45:41.360 --> 45:49.640
 thing that the way you build deep relationships is you really kind of notice the things that

45:49.640 --> 45:56.480
 people are telling you, like what they want and what they're bothered by, what are their

45:56.480 --> 46:01.720
 big problems in their lives, because everybody's saying that all the time and most of us are

46:01.720 --> 46:02.720
 just ignoring it.

46:02.720 --> 46:03.720
 Right.

46:03.720 --> 46:07.680
 But if you take the time to listen, you know somebody at that point.

46:07.680 --> 46:08.680
 Absolutely you do.

46:08.680 --> 46:10.360
 Then you have to be able to dismiss it.

46:10.360 --> 46:15.600
 You know, you're looking for that just to see how I can manipulate that is what you're

46:15.600 --> 46:17.120
 trying to do.

46:17.120 --> 46:22.040
 So the lady was one story, another truly despicable story.

46:22.040 --> 46:25.760
 We'll get to script in a second, but another truly despicable story.

46:25.760 --> 46:30.360
 We had, we were one of the really first groups that started phishing attacks.

46:30.360 --> 46:31.600
 What's phishing?

46:31.600 --> 46:33.600
 So that is a social engineering attack.

46:33.600 --> 46:34.600
 PH, by the way.

46:34.600 --> 46:35.600
 Yeah, PH.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.880
 That's another social engineering attack.

46:36.880 --> 46:41.200
 It's sending that fake email out that looks like it's coming from a website or your financial

46:41.200 --> 46:44.400
 organization or whatever and saying, Hey, we've got a security problem.

46:44.400 --> 46:46.600
 We need you to update your account information.

46:46.600 --> 46:50.560
 Well, back then no one had ever seen a phishing attack.

46:50.560 --> 46:53.400
 So you could ask for all the information.

46:53.400 --> 46:57.440
 You were getting just complete identity profiles on a phishing email.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.440
 Nowadays you can't do that.

46:58.440 --> 47:02.200
 Nowadays you look for basically credentials because everyone is aware of phishing.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.920
 But back then it was complete information.

47:03.920 --> 47:09.640
 We had a phished out, I don't know, 200,000 eTrade accounts is what we had the login.

47:09.640 --> 47:10.640
 Login password.

47:10.640 --> 47:11.640
 Yeah.

47:11.640 --> 47:16.560
 Login password, complete, you know, social, date of birth, mother's maiden, account information,

47:16.560 --> 47:17.800
 everything else.

47:17.800 --> 47:24.200
 So we had access to those eTrade accounts, eTrade initially had no security in place.

47:24.200 --> 47:28.960
 So you could cash out the account, ACH the money out to whoever, to whatever account

47:28.960 --> 47:31.000
 you wanted to went through just fine.

47:31.000 --> 47:38.000
 Ain't I'm alive on that for four to six months, eTrade got to the, to the point where they,

47:38.000 --> 47:42.440
 you couldn't do any ACH coming out, you know, you, they locked everything down.

47:42.440 --> 47:46.440
 Well, you're still sitting on thousands of eTrade accounts.

47:46.440 --> 47:49.000
 How do you make money on that?

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
 Hmm.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.280
 That's a good question.

47:51.280 --> 47:52.280
 Yeah.

47:52.280 --> 47:56.040
 So what you do is you find some fat cat that's got his retirement, you know, invested in

47:56.040 --> 47:57.040
 blue chips.

47:57.040 --> 48:02.080
 At the same time, you find a penny stock, you open up a brand new account, buy into that

48:02.080 --> 48:07.200
 penny stock, cash the fat cat out, buy into that same penny stock, pump and dump schemes

48:07.200 --> 48:08.200
 all of a sudden.

48:08.200 --> 48:13.040
 So you're destroying people's retirement accounts for just a few thousand dollars.

48:13.040 --> 48:14.040
 Bam, bam, bam.

48:14.040 --> 48:17.280
 And of course, eTrade's response is not our problem.

48:17.280 --> 48:18.520
 It's your problem.

48:18.520 --> 48:21.680
 You shouldn't give up your password or what have you at that point.

48:21.680 --> 48:25.600
 And you still see that issue today with Zell scams and things like that.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.040
 Zell scams, Zell.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.840
 So you know, the instant payment that, that's the same kind of operation.

48:29.840 --> 48:32.640
 Same type of difference with the same kind of mechanism.

48:32.640 --> 48:35.640
 You find an easy way to exploit a system.

48:35.640 --> 48:40.320
 And typically the financial organization, not our problem, our system secure.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.320
 It's the humans.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.320
 It's their errors.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.840
 Well, not really.

48:43.840 --> 48:48.280
 You know, you've got some culpability in that and you're just trying to avoid paying

48:48.280 --> 48:50.200
 the part of the bill is what's going on.

48:50.200 --> 48:56.600
 One of the things just to stand fishing for a bit is it really makes me sad because there's

48:56.600 --> 49:02.240
 been people on all kinds of platforms like including YouTube comments, but emails too.

49:02.240 --> 49:04.720
 They figured out emails somehow.

49:04.720 --> 49:14.000
 So people are now seeing the followers of this particular podcast where fans, they're

49:14.000 --> 49:19.320
 finding them on platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube and so on.

49:19.320 --> 49:24.560
 And they are figuring out ways to get to those people by another channel, right?

49:24.560 --> 49:29.720
 Which I suppose is, it seems more authentic to those people.

49:29.720 --> 49:37.000
 So they send them an email from what looks like me and with this kind, like, like loving

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
 them.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
 The interesting thing, the email sound like something I would write.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.320
 So these aren't even at this stage, it's not even, it doesn't feel automated.

49:46.320 --> 49:52.160
 Or if it's automated, it's, there's a human in the loop that's really fine tuning to specific

49:52.160 --> 49:58.440
 or maybe I'm very predictable, but it's very loving in the way I would write that message.

49:58.440 --> 49:59.440
 So think about that.

49:59.440 --> 50:00.440
 All right.

50:00.440 --> 50:04.720
 So when fishing first comes out, you could look at the language of the text or the website

50:04.720 --> 50:08.000
 and say, yeah, if you were paying attention to that, that's so okay.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.720
 So that's not an English speaker who wrote that typically, all right.

50:11.720 --> 50:17.120
 But as, as time has went on, as, as the awareness of what a fishing attack looks like, we have

50:17.120 --> 50:21.080
 people that are sitting down now and making sure that the language is proper.

50:21.080 --> 50:22.080
 It gets worse than that though.

50:22.080 --> 50:25.960
 If you look at business email compromise, all right, so the way a business email compromise

50:25.960 --> 50:31.680
 typically works is the attacker will find a payroll person, find a CEO.

50:31.680 --> 50:36.560
 He will, he will fashion a spearfishing email, which is, that's a fishing attack that's targeting

50:36.560 --> 50:39.120
 one specific individual, all right.

50:39.120 --> 50:43.780
 So he'll fashion a spearfishing email and the way he does that is he pulls all the information

50:43.780 --> 50:49.680
 he possibly can on that person, all right, that CEO.

50:49.680 --> 50:57.400
 Maybe he'll spear that CEO just to get their login credentials to their email, just to

50:57.400 --> 51:01.360
 read the emails and he'll, he'll go in there and he'll start reading all these emails.

51:01.360 --> 51:05.840
 He'll specifically read the emails to the, to the payroll department, see what that relationship

51:05.840 --> 51:06.840
 is.

51:06.840 --> 51:07.840
 Are they talking about their kids?

51:07.840 --> 51:09.560
 Are they talking about relationships, talking about vacation?

51:09.560 --> 51:10.560
 What are they talking about?

51:10.560 --> 51:11.560
 How are they talking?

51:11.560 --> 51:12.560
 Are they friendly?

51:12.560 --> 51:13.560
 Are they sterile?

51:13.560 --> 51:14.560
 What are they doing?

51:14.560 --> 51:15.560
 All right.

51:15.560 --> 51:18.880
 So then he decides, well, I'm going to go ahead and spear fish the payroll department

51:18.880 --> 51:20.120
 as well.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.680
 So then he spear fishes them, gets those credentials.

51:22.680 --> 51:27.760
 At the same time, he creates a Unicode domain in whatever the company name is, all right.

51:27.760 --> 51:31.920
 So instead of that English alphabet I, he's got that Russian letter that looks like an

51:31.920 --> 51:38.040
 eye, but without the dot on top, all right, comes back into the email, into the payroll

51:38.040 --> 51:44.120
 email, blocks the real CEO's email, replaces that with the Unicode email that he's got

51:44.120 --> 51:50.680
 and then sends out a message using the correct language, the correct relationships, everything

51:50.680 --> 51:53.560
 else and says, Hey, you know, we're updating our account status.

51:53.560 --> 51:57.120
 I need you to send this payment instead of the over here.

51:57.120 --> 51:59.960
 They've set up a new account, send all payments over here now.

51:59.960 --> 52:04.920
 And that is business email compromise in a nutshell, all right, works great.

52:04.920 --> 52:10.240
 Probably the larger the organization, the more susceptible to that kind of attack because

52:10.240 --> 52:16.960
 there's a, like a distribution of responsibility to where you're more likely to believe that,

52:16.960 --> 52:19.000
 okay, this other person is responsible.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.360
 I'm sure they, they secured everything.

52:21.360 --> 52:22.360
 Absolutely.

52:22.360 --> 52:24.360
 I'm okay listening to this.

52:24.360 --> 52:27.720
 So that's business email compromise and it's, it, those crimes and it's one of the things

52:27.720 --> 52:29.000
 you see about cyber crimes.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
 Cyber crime is not really sophisticated.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.880
 It's not the attacks are not sophisticated.

52:32.880 --> 52:38.200
 The stat is 90% of every single attack uses a known exploit.

52:38.200 --> 52:41.200
 It's not the, it's not zero day attacks.

52:41.200 --> 52:44.560
 They're out there, but if you're a criminal waiting on a zero day to profit, you're going

52:44.560 --> 52:46.880
 to starve to death.

52:46.880 --> 52:51.520
 The meat and potatoes are that 90% known exploits.

52:51.520 --> 52:57.760
 And the rest is, well, you're saying it's a, maybe you mean it's not technically sophisticated,

52:57.760 --> 53:00.040
 but it's social engineering sophisticated.

53:00.040 --> 53:01.720
 Very sophisticated on that end.

53:01.720 --> 53:02.720
 Very sophisticated.

53:02.720 --> 53:04.480
 It's a fascinating study of.

53:04.480 --> 53:09.840
 That establishment of trust and then using that trust to defraud that victim.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.240
 That is something.

53:11.240 --> 53:16.680
 I wish obviously all of these folks are really good at hiding.

53:16.680 --> 53:21.320
 I wish you could tell their stories in the way, which is why you're fascinating is you're

53:21.320 --> 53:28.240
 able to tell these stories now cause it is studying human nature by exploiting it, but

53:28.240 --> 53:36.680
 you get to understand like our weak points are our hope, our desire to trust others.

53:36.680 --> 53:44.680
 Also sort of the, the weak points and the failures of digital systems and at scale humans have

53:44.680 --> 53:45.680
 to connect.

53:45.680 --> 53:46.680
 Right.

53:46.680 --> 53:47.680
 It's fascinating.

53:47.680 --> 53:55.000
 This is a weird question, um, asking for a friend, uh, is, is spearfishing itself illegal?

53:55.000 --> 53:56.200
 What's the legality here?

53:56.200 --> 53:57.200
 Oh, it's all illegal.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.200
 Absolutely.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.200
 It is.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.200
 Is it absolute?

54:00.200 --> 54:01.200
 So here's what, okay.

54:01.200 --> 54:03.640
 Let me, let me construct an example.

54:03.640 --> 54:12.920
 So I, if, if my friend were to spearfish like a CEO, right, and get their information and

54:12.920 --> 54:20.800
 after they get control, save their Twitter account, they tweet something loving and positive.

54:20.800 --> 54:21.800
 What's the crime?

54:21.800 --> 54:24.000
 Unauthorized access of advice.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.840
 What will be the punishment do you think?

54:27.840 --> 54:29.200
 That becomes questionable.

54:29.200 --> 54:33.040
 So, so no monetary loss or was there a monetary loss?

54:33.040 --> 54:34.040
 Probably not.

54:34.040 --> 54:35.040
 All right.

54:35.040 --> 54:38.240
 So you have to figure out who the victim is before charges are pressed.

54:38.240 --> 54:41.240
 Now the crime would be unauth, unauthorized access.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.640
 All right.

54:42.640 --> 54:48.240
 But no real victim on that, unless, you know, the, the person whose account you took over

54:48.240 --> 54:53.240
 takes, you know, exception to that, um, no monetary loss.

54:53.240 --> 54:55.360
 There's not really standard, like fines.

54:55.360 --> 54:56.360
 Probably nothing's going to happen.

54:56.360 --> 54:57.360
 Right.

54:57.360 --> 54:58.360
 Right.

54:58.360 --> 54:59.360
 Right.

54:59.360 --> 55:03.760
 So, I mean, that, that's kind of interesting because it's, it's, so when I got the ransomware,

55:03.760 --> 55:11.600
 um, when I got, uh, with the zero day attack on the QNAP mask, you know, they, they basically

55:11.600 --> 55:20.880
 say the, the, the criminal is QNAP, the company for having so many security vulnerabilities.

55:20.880 --> 55:26.480
 They're, uh, like you are the victim of QNAP's incompetence.

55:26.480 --> 55:27.960
 That's the way they kind of phrase it.

55:27.960 --> 55:30.040
 And see, I don't agree with that.

55:30.040 --> 55:32.040
 I don't agree with that at all.

55:32.040 --> 55:41.400
 So solar winds, let's, let's, so I've got 130 page class action lawsuit printed

55:41.400 --> 55:42.400
 out at the house.

55:42.400 --> 55:43.400
 I've been going through it.

55:43.400 --> 55:48.680
 That catalogs how solar winds lied for years about their vulnerabilities and they lied

55:48.680 --> 55:49.680
 to investors.

55:49.680 --> 55:54.280
 The, uh, the people who came in, the auditors would come who they would hire would, you

55:54.280 --> 55:57.920
 know, they would, uh, not pay attention to them when they said, you know, you've got

55:57.920 --> 55:58.920
 these issues.

55:58.920 --> 56:03.560
 They would say go away shit like that for years until solar winds, you know, the attacks

56:03.560 --> 56:05.120
 become apparent.

56:05.120 --> 56:13.920
 Um, my view on that is that the only person responsible for the crime are the criminals

56:13.920 --> 56:18.520
 who did the attacking, the actual criminals, not, not solar with, now does that mean the

56:18.520 --> 56:21.400
 solar winds isn't, isn't all fucked up?

56:21.400 --> 56:22.400
 They are.

56:22.400 --> 56:28.360
 And there needs to be some accounting in place, but the, the, the only individual, the only

56:28.360 --> 56:31.560
 people responsible for crime are the criminals.

56:31.560 --> 56:38.160
 And that's either online in the physical world, what have you could be, it's being an idiot

56:38.160 --> 56:46.200
 is not a crime, you know, being, being, being criminally negligent is, and I think that,

56:46.200 --> 56:51.520
 that solar winds is certainly responsible, not, not responsible, they're culpable for

56:51.520 --> 56:52.520
 what happened.

56:52.520 --> 56:55.520
 Can you actually, uh, tell folks about solar winds?

56:55.520 --> 56:56.520
 What is it?

56:56.520 --> 57:00.520
 Um, what, what, what was, what are some interesting things that you're aware of?

57:00.520 --> 57:05.640
 I mean, solar winds was very, it was, it, it provided a background, a backbone of security

57:05.640 --> 57:11.080
 for hundreds, thousands of different companies.

57:11.080 --> 57:16.040
 Um, if you looked at a lot of security companies were using solar winds, that would, that would

57:16.040 --> 57:20.560
 allow you to get a snapshot of the entire system that they were working on.

57:20.560 --> 57:28.240
 So what happens is, is you get a Russian group that comes in and they basically, they hack

57:28.240 --> 57:35.440
 into solar winds and get access to it and it allows them to view every single thing.

57:35.440 --> 57:43.200
 I mean, every single thing about every single client that solar winds had at that point.

57:43.200 --> 57:47.960
 So entire snapshots of all the IP that weren't, that was going on, all the emails, all the

57:47.960 --> 57:51.920
 communications, every single secret that was going on with those companies.

57:51.920 --> 57:56.600
 If company had software like Microsoft, it allowed them to look at the source code of

57:56.600 --> 58:02.000
 everything that was going on, I mean, it's just a complete and total nightmare, all right.

58:02.000 --> 58:09.200
 And something that you are not going to recover from, you're not, I mean, it's done at that

58:09.200 --> 58:10.200
 point.

58:10.200 --> 58:13.640
 Um, you know, there's not been a lot of news lately about it.

58:13.640 --> 58:17.960
 But the fact of the matter is, is that's the type of attack that's a catastrophic attack.

58:17.960 --> 58:24.400
 So there's a huge amount of information that was read, saved elsewhere, probably.

58:24.400 --> 58:27.280
 And so now there's people sitting on information.

58:27.280 --> 58:28.280
 Absolutely.

58:28.280 --> 58:33.960
 So think about one of the attack vectors has been Microsoft Outlook 365, things like that.

58:33.960 --> 58:37.480
 This allowed the attackers to look at the source codes of that.

58:37.480 --> 58:39.320
 So they have the source code now.

58:39.320 --> 58:43.920
 So they go through it line by line or other vulnerabilities, let's find new vulnerabilities,

58:43.920 --> 58:44.920
 new zero days.

58:44.920 --> 58:50.120
 I said zero days aren't common, but this opens up an entire new threat surface all of a sudden.

58:50.120 --> 58:52.680
 So it's a, it's a completely catastrophic attack.

58:52.680 --> 58:56.320
 So all the chips are down, everything's tallyed up, people are going to be like, yeah, we're

58:56.320 --> 58:57.320
 done.

58:57.320 --> 58:58.320
 We're done.

58:58.320 --> 58:59.320
 Yeah.

58:59.320 --> 59:00.320
 All right.

59:00.320 --> 59:04.880
 This whole computer thing, we tried it, we're walking away.

59:04.880 --> 59:05.880
 We're done.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.680
 That's terrifying.

59:07.680 --> 59:14.800
 So you're saying that there's not been obvious, uh, big negative impact from that yet.

59:14.800 --> 59:18.720
 So but like, there's been a lot of negative impact, but we're just starting, right?

59:18.720 --> 59:22.600
 So that's starting the capacity for destruction is huge here.

59:22.600 --> 59:26.680
 How much involvement from nation states do you think there is on this?

59:26.680 --> 59:29.120
 You know, it's interesting.

59:29.120 --> 59:33.320
 So you've got Iran, you've got North Korea, China, Russia, you got the big four.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.680
 You also got Brazil.

59:35.680 --> 59:40.960
 You've got all these other countries that are interested in the United States as well.

59:40.960 --> 59:44.080
 Nation states are interesting depending on who the nation state is.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.080
 All right.

59:45.080 --> 59:48.520
 So Russia is very good about working with the type of criminal I used to be, you know,

59:48.520 --> 59:52.000
 they'll enlist these guys and steal information and what have you.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.600
 And Russia will take the information they want to, and they'll basically go off and

59:55.600 --> 59:57.640
 sell whatever you want to make some money.

59:57.640 --> 1:00:03.080
 Um, China is all about IP, um, North Korea is about stealing money because they really

1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:08.480
 don't know what, what the hell else to do right now, but, uh, to North Korea is actively

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:09.480
 involved in cybercrime.

1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:10.480
 Absolutely.

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:13.400
 They've stolen a shitload of Bitcoin, everything else.

1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:14.400
 So absolutely.

1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:19.160
 They're actively involved with that, um, very, very skilled attackers, very skilled.

1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:23.640
 But even if you look at, you know, I told you that stat about 90%, all right.

1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:31.720
 So even though SolarWinds is going to be the number one attack, the, the follow up to that

1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:34.360
 is this not pedia attack that happened.

1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:39.280
 And so that was the most sophisticated attack launched by the Russian sandworm group using

1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:41.760
 all known exploits throughout.

1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:47.520
 So it's not, again, it's not, you're right in the sophistication is typically not technical

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:51.000
 sophistication, but it says social engineering sophistication.

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:56.320
 How do you get these things put together in line to attack and succeed?

1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:59.640
 But when you get access to the source code, that's where technical sophistication could

1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:01.160
 really do a lot of damage.

1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:05.360
 And that's when you find out real quick, that's what separates the men from the boys in this

1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:06.360
 game.

1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:07.360
 All right.

1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:09.600
 Because all of a sudden it's not, I don't have to worry about social engineering.

1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:16.320
 I've got source codes and I've got professionals that are looking at that and that's your ass.

1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:20.800
 Which then enables probably even more powerful social engineering methods too.

1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:28.520
 I mean, it's just cascade of, is this terrifying to you, by the way, this, that this world

1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:35.640
 that we're living in, as we put more and more of ourselves on the, the internet into the

1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:41.520
 metaverse, that there's so many more attack vectors on our wellbeing.

1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:49.160
 What's terrifying to me, I used to preach it on Shadow Crew, is the idea that the perception

1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:53.000
 of truth is more important than the truth itself.

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.520
 It doesn't matter what the facts are, it matters what I can convince you of.

1:01:57.520 --> 1:01:59.320
 That's what's terrifying to me.

1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:04.760
 So you look at deep fakes, you look at fake news, all this stuff that's going out.

1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:10.200
 That becomes truly terrifying.

1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:17.120
 Maybe there's an angle where it's freeing, if nothing is true and you can't trust anything.

1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:21.280
 But you see, we as human beings, we want to trust.

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:26.600
 We do, we need human interaction and for that human interaction, you have to have a degree

1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:27.600
 of trust.

1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:33.720
 But it's more like, you let go of an idea of absolute truth and it more becomes like

1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:36.320
 a blockchain style consensus.

1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:43.960
 So you let go of like, you know what, there's this human dream, you get this on the internet,

1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:49.000
 you get like facts, as if there's at the bottom, at the bottom, there's one turtle

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:54.800
 that's holding this like scroll that says, these are the truths of the world.

1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:59.760
 The problem is, I mean, maybe believing that is counterproductive.

1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:05.200
 Maybe human civilization is an ongoing process of consensus.

1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:10.120
 And so it's always going to be, everything is shrouded in, you can call them lies or

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:14.320
 you can call them inaccuracies or you can call them delusions.

1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:19.800
 It's constantly going to be, it's going to be a sea of lies and delusions.

1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:25.640
 But our hope is to, over time, develop bigger and bigger islands of consensus that allows

1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:27.960
 us to live a stable and happy society.

1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:30.160
 Don't call it true.

1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:36.320
 Call it a stable consensus that creates a high quality of life for the inhabitants of

1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:37.320
 the island.

1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:38.320
 I like it.

1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:39.320
 I mean, I like it.

1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:40.600
 I mean, that's, we're going to agree on this.

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:41.600
 And then don't use outlet.

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:43.480
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:48.720
 So maybe a step back, you mentioned, I'd love to talk about shadow crew.

1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:51.800
 Maybe this is the right time to actually, yeah, let's go to shadow crew because it's

1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:52.800
 such a fascinating story.

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:57.440
 So tell me the story of building shadow crew, the precursor to today's dark net and dark

1:03:57.440 --> 1:03:59.960
 net markets.

1:03:59.960 --> 1:04:03.160
 This is why you're the original Godfather.

1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:04.160
 This is it.

1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:05.160
 This is it.

1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:06.640
 So I, I get married.

1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:10.320
 I faked a car accident to get married, got the money from that.

1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:11.320
 You're romantic.

1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:12.320
 I'm romantic.

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:13.320
 It's like my dad, man.

1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:16.880
 I'm the guy that, you know, I get, from mom, I get the criminal mindset.

1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:20.080
 From dad, I get that, don't want him to leave.

1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:22.600
 So, you know, so.

1:04:22.600 --> 1:04:26.400
 To get married, what's that story?

1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:29.760
 Oh, dude, I was, how did you fall in love there?

1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:35.120
 My first girlfriend was a preacher's daughter and crazy over her dated her for five years

1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:40.640
 and she figured out pretty quickly that, well, not quickly, it took her five years to figure

1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:43.200
 out that Brett Johnson is not the man of God.

1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:50.760
 You know, I, I could, I could talk it, but you know, more of that agnostic than anything,

1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:52.480
 she breaks up with me.

1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:55.080
 So I was, I was at the community college.

1:04:55.080 --> 1:05:03.120
 We'd make one half a preacher by the best, but yeah, you know, I've got that Langston

1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:04.120
 Hughes problem.

1:05:04.120 --> 1:05:09.080
 You know, I'm looking for Jesus to show up and he just doesn't.

1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:12.000
 So I was, I was at the community college and I was, I was a straight asshole.

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:18.040
 I was arrogant, conceded everything else and I had posted an advertisement on one of the

1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:22.680
 billboards looking for an adult babysitter, hot blonde, you know, come, come visit me

1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:24.320
 in the library.

1:05:24.320 --> 1:05:26.200
 He mine shows up and he's like, Brett.

1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:29.920
 And I was like, yeah, he's like hottest girl in school right down the hall.

1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:30.920
 And I was like, serious?

1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:31.920
 He's like, yeah.

1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:33.160
 And I was like, let's go see.

1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:37.480
 So walk over and there's these two guys that are hitting on her.

1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:42.400
 So I'm, I just walk up and me and Todd, that was my buddy, walk up and I'm just sitting

1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:45.360
 there and listening and they're, you know, they're giving the spill and everything.

1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:46.680
 And she's just kind of taking it in.

1:05:46.680 --> 1:05:51.000
 Finally, I looked over and I was like, you want to get out of here.

1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.160
 And one of the guys looks at me, he's like, Hey, we're talking to her.

1:05:54.160 --> 1:05:56.000
 I was like, well, you're talking at her.

1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:57.040
 You're not talking to her.

1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:59.040
 I'm about to save her ass from you.

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:00.040
 Yeah.

1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:01.040
 This is a smooth pickup line, by the way.

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:02.240
 If I ever heard one, that's good.

1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:04.320
 You want to get out of here?

1:06:04.320 --> 1:06:11.160
 So start dating and she was the girl that screwed my brains out.

1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:13.200
 And I felt I had over heels.

1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:16.160
 We got married six months later, six months.

1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:17.280
 That's what love does.

1:06:17.280 --> 1:06:18.280
 That's what it does.

1:06:18.280 --> 1:06:22.920
 And I had, I was, she didn't know I was a crook.

1:06:22.920 --> 1:06:26.320
 She had no idea, you know, she knew I was very bright.

1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:30.600
 She knew I would do a lot of theater, stuff like that.

1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:34.400
 Got a job at, I was in hazard, there was no jobs to be had.

1:06:34.400 --> 1:06:38.560
 So I got a job in Lexington because we were going to be moving to, to UK.

1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:44.560
 Got a job in Lexington at Lexmark testing printer boards, circuit boards.

1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:50.760
 So I would leave on a Thursday night, work three 18 hour shifts at Lexmark, come back

1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:58.160
 home on Monday, got married, faked a car accident to get that, the other, the rest of the money

1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:02.240
 that I needed to, to get married.

1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:08.280
 And the, the faking on that man, I had bought a Chevy Spectrum at a car auction, gave like

1:07:08.280 --> 1:07:09.880
 500 bucks for it.

1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:15.280
 My aunt had previously defrauded USA insurance on a car accident.

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:19.000
 And she was telling me all about, she's like, look, go down to this chiropractor, make sure

1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.360
 you get the insurance where they'll pay for a rental car.

1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:22.360
 They'll pay lost wages.

1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:23.860
 And I was like, they pay lost wages?

1:07:23.860 --> 1:07:25.720
 She's like, yeah, they pay lost wages.

1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:26.720
 I was like, hmm.

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:29.160
 She's like, by the way, you work for me.

1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:30.760
 And I was like, I work for you.

1:07:30.760 --> 1:07:31.760
 So, so.

1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:36.760
 And you get to define the, with the wage and you can also define how long you are unable

1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:37.760
 to work.

1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:38.760
 Exactly.

1:07:38.760 --> 1:07:39.760
 Exactly.

1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:40.760
 And the chiropractor will sign off on any damn thing.

1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:41.760
 All right.

1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:47.000
 So, my cousin Ronnie, he figures out that I'm going, he finds out I'm going to fake this

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.720
 car accident, so he comes to me and he's like, hey, man, can I get in on that?

1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:51.520
 I was like, yeah, man, you get on that.

1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:54.120
 So this kid, he's five days younger than I am.

1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:58.440
 This kid, he goes to the dentist the day that we're faking it, has a tooth pulled, tells

1:07:58.440 --> 1:08:01.280
 the dentist not to numb it, not to stitch it.

1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:02.280
 Just pull it.

1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:07.200
 So he shows up, he shows up the day that we're driving out to fake the accident.

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:08.400
 He's got blood all over his shirt.

1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:09.960
 He's still bleeding out of the mouth and everything else.

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:10.960
 I'm like, are you okay?

1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:11.960
 And he's like, yeah, man, it's going to be good.

1:08:11.960 --> 1:08:12.960
 It's going to be good.

1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:13.960
 I'm like, okay.

1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:17.400
 My mom, by this point, I'm living with my grandparents.

1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:20.440
 My mom is up in the head of a hollow.

1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:22.040
 So we're like, we'll just do it up there.

1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:26.640
 We'll go act like we're visiting my mom on the way back out, ran over a mountain.

1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:27.640
 Okay.

1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:32.440
 So we go visit and everything, come back out that night, run over the side of the hill,

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:33.840
 me and Ronnie walk back up.

1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:36.080
 Of course, it totals the car.

1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:38.040
 Walk back to my mom's acting like we've wrecked.

1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:41.960
 She knows what time it is and everything else and follow the claims.

1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:49.440
 So that gets the money to, uh, to get married and me and my wife move from hazard to Lexington.

1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:58.200
 And I'm the kid that, uh, my crime, usually if I was a single guy, wouldn't break the

1:08:58.200 --> 1:08:59.200
 law.

1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:00.200
 What?

1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:01.200
 And I would be all right.

1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:05.000
 You know, but females involved, oh yeah, oh yeah, gotta spend the money, gotta show

1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:06.000
 them gifts.

1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.640
 Everything else was never enough to show loved in some sort of healthy way.

1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:10.640
 Always had to go overboard.

1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:13.480
 Typically it was buying some or stealing some sort of expensive crap.

1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:19.240
 So that, that was the thing, that was the way you show love is by buying expensive gifts.

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:20.240
 Right.

1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:21.240
 Or something overboard.

1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:25.520
 Back then with, with Susan initially, it was don't worry about working.

1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:26.880
 I got it.

1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:27.880
 You just worry about going to school.

1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:28.880
 She was a music major.

1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:31.720
 I was like, you just worry about going to school.

1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:33.960
 So don't worry about cooking and cleaning.

1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:34.960
 I got it.

1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:35.960
 I got it.

1:09:35.960 --> 1:09:38.800
 So not only was I this, this guy that was going overboard, but it's kind of a control

1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:39.800
 freak too.

1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:40.800
 Right.

1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:41.800
 So now I got it.

1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:42.800
 I got it.

1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:43.800
 I got it.

1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:49.040
 So here I am, you know, 60 hour a week job, 18 hour class load, cooking and cleaning,

1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:50.360
 something had to give.

1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:51.360
 I quit the job.

1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:52.360
 I couldn't do it.

1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:57.980
 Quit the job and start back in fraud and trying to hide that from her at the same time.

1:09:57.980 --> 1:10:02.640
 So it was initially telemarketing fraud started.

1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:09.000
 I was working at the first job I had was a telemarketer at a cemetery selling grave sites.

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:14.640
 And then that ended, went over to work for the Shriners Circus Shriners Hospital.

1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:18.320
 And there was a third party company that was doing all the telemarketing made really good

1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:19.840
 money doing that.

1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:25.720
 That job ended and then they pivoted over to working with Kiwanis clubs, selling food

1:10:25.720 --> 1:10:29.400
 baskets to the food banks and everything.

1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:36.840
 So I stole the phone list and started at my own Kiwanis club and would do the telemarketing,

1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:39.160
 go out twice a week and pick up checks.

1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:47.000
 Well, what happened was is I'm going out picking up checks, go knock on a door, turns out one

1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:50.920
 of the persons that I had called was a law enforcement officer.

1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:52.760
 So he was like, who are you?

1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:55.440
 I'm like, I'm with the Kiwanis club.

1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:57.560
 He's like, no, you're not.

1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:05.640
 So got arrested, spent three months in a county jail for theft by deception, got out and we

1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:11.040
 had to move from Lexington back to hazard and live with Susan's parents.

1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:19.800
 They had gotten a desktop computer HP and I started surfing around online, found eBay

1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:22.960
 and didn't really know how to make money on eBay.

1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:29.760
 About the same time, I'm committing low level frauds online and I don't really talk about

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:30.760
 that in the past.

1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:36.920
 The first time I've really talked about that, but I would pay for it with bad checks.

1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:41.080
 So some more person, so not using a platform like eBay and more.

1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:45.360
 I would find somebody that had like a stereo system on eBay, something like that and I'd

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:50.840
 pay for it with bad check and would rely on them not to chase me because they were out

1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:54.120
 of state at that point and the dollar amounts were very low.

1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:59.480
 So got the money to move to finally did those schemes enough to get the money to move back

1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:05.240
 to Lexington, got to Lexington and by this point I'm doing these, like I said, these

1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:10.320
 schemes on eBay and I'm like, there's got to be a better way to make money on eBay.

1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:11.320
 Got to be.

1:12:11.320 --> 1:12:16.840
 So didn't really know how one night I'm watching Inside Edition with Bill Riley and their

1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:18.960
 profiling Beanie Babies.

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:22.040
 So I'm sitting there watching the one they're profiling is this one called Peanut the Royal

1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:25.720
 Blue Elephant selling for $1,500 on eBay.

1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:29.040
 I'm sitting there going like, shit, I need to find me a peanut.

1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:33.680
 So my initial thought was, well, there's got to be one in one of these Hallmark stores

1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:35.560
 in Kentucky someplace.

1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:40.160
 So I skip class the next day went out around all the Hallmark stores looking for peanut.

1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:41.160
 No idiot.

1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:43.880
 He's on eBay for $1,500.

1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:51.000
 So after a few hours of that, I'm like, hmm, turns out they had a little gray Beanie Baby

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:56.200
 Elephants for $8, picked up one of those for $8, stopped by Kroger on the way home, picked

1:12:56.200 --> 1:13:00.160
 up a pack of blue, red dye, went home, tried to dye the little guy.

1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:02.800
 So that was a nightmare.

1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:04.840
 Turns out they're made out of polyester.

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:05.840
 Get them out of the bath.

1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:08.720
 Looks like they've got the mange.

1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:12.160
 And what happens is I saw, I'm trying to die the damn thing and I'm like, well, that's

1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:13.160
 not going to work.

1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:14.680
 That's just not going to work.

1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:19.360
 So I got online, found a picture of a real one posted it on eBay.

1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:25.720
 And I was like, well, what I can do is I can claim that's the one I've got.

1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:29.440
 And then maybe claim that it got messed up in the mail and work out like that.

1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:32.560
 So posted a picture of a real one online.

1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:33.800
 Woman thought I had the real thing.

1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:37.480
 She wins the bid that social engineering kicks in immediately.

1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:39.480
 I didn't want to, I didn't want to be on the defensive.

1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:41.480
 I wanted to put her on the defensive.

1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:45.640
 So as soon as she wins the bid, I send her a message, hey, we've not done any business

1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:46.640
 before.

1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:47.640
 I don't even know if I can trust you.

1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:52.920
 What I need you to do protects us both go down the US Postal Service, get two money

1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:57.600
 orders totaling $1,500, send them to me issued by the US government.

1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:00.200
 That way we're both protected.

1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:02.680
 Soon as I get the money orders, I'll send you your animal.

1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:04.800
 She believed that didn't ask any questions at all.

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:07.840
 She believed that sent me the money orders.

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:12.560
 I cashed them out, send her the creature immediately got a phone call.

1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:13.880
 I didn't order this.

1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:16.760
 My response lady, you ordered a blue elephant.

1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:20.200
 I sent you a blue fish elephant.

1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:24.040
 And she got pissed and she kept calling.

1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:28.000
 What I found out, and that's really the first lesson of cyber crime that most of these criminals,

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.240
 including self, learns.

1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:31.880
 If you delay a victim long enough, just keep putting them off.

1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:35.600
 A lot of them, they get exasperated, throw their hands in the air, walk away.

1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:37.000
 You don't hear from them.

1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.560
 And none of them, to this day, none of them complained law enforcement.

1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:42.560
 They eat it.

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:47.520
 So it's a mixture of like you were exhausted by the process.

1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:49.600
 So it's just easier to walk away.

1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:52.240
 One second, almost like an embarrassment.

1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:55.080
 So there's a whole slew of reasons, all right?

1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:56.920
 There's the exhaustion, certainly.

1:14:56.920 --> 1:14:57.960
 There's the embarrassment.

1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:01.080
 So if you figure out, if you look at it today, where does the embarrassment come from?

1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:06.600
 Well, the media, family members, we're all very good about blaming the victim for crimes.

1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:07.600
 Why would you click on the link?

1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:10.320
 Why would you send money to somebody you don't know, blah, blah, blah.

1:15:10.320 --> 1:15:12.400
 So you've got that's going on.

1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:15.880
 You've got the issue of who do you complain to?

1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:16.880
 Back then you didn't know.

1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:20.040
 Do you complain to local police because she's in another state?

1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:22.640
 So which local police do you complain to?

1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:23.640
 Do you complain to the feds?

1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:26.400
 Well, the dollar amounts aren't high enough to complain to feds.

1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:28.400
 Feds, you're going to tell you to go local.

1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:31.680
 Locals going to tell you, hey, it happened in Kentucky, complain to them.

1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:34.120
 Kentucky's going to tell you, well, shit, you're over there.

1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:35.120
 We need you to come in.

1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:41.560
 So there's this whole issue, the jurisdiction of the blame factor, everything else.

1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:46.920
 So I got away with that crime and did it under my own name at that point.

1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:51.920
 I kept going and got better at it, started to understand how to hide identities, things

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:52.920
 like that.

1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:57.400
 Started selling pirated software, pirated software led into installing modchips.

1:15:57.400 --> 1:16:01.680
 It was for the initial pirated software was a Sega Saturn PlayStation one.

1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:05.520
 Well, you had to have a modchip in those to play the pirated discs.

1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:09.000
 So I started selling and installing modchips.

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:13.040
 That led into installing modchips into cable television boxes so you could watch all the

1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:19.880
 pay per view, which in turn led into programming satellite DSS cards, those 18 inch RCA satellite

1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:24.880
 systems, pull the card out of it, program it, turns on all the channels.

1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:25.880
 Started doing that.

1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:28.560
 Can we just pause?

1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:33.920
 That is very entrepreneurial.

1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:43.400
 So just technically, so there's laws and rules that you're breaking nonstop.

1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:49.280
 So there's also legitimate ways of doing that, which is break the rules of the conventions

1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:50.280
 of the past.

1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:51.520
 That's the first principles thing.

1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:55.640
 That's what Elon Musk and his ilk do all the time.

1:16:55.640 --> 1:16:59.640
 That is guts and brilliance.

1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:07.520
 But when it's crossing the lines of the law, actually sometimes the law is outdated.

1:17:07.520 --> 1:17:12.840
 The thing is as a human being, you have to then compute the ethical damage you're doing,

1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:15.400
 like ethically the damage you're doing about other human beings.

1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:20.040
 That is fundamentally the thing that you're breaking is you're adding to the suffering

1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:24.400
 in the world in way where another and you're justifying it.

1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:29.600
 But in terms of me sort of as an engineer, that is some gutsy thinking.

1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:34.560
 That's how was and Steve Jobs thought.

1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:36.040
 That's innovation.

1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:44.840
 And maybe just think, if you can introspect your thinking process here, I like how you

1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:50.640
 remember that it's an HP, this is a totally new thing to you.

1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:53.760
 Computers is yet another domain.

1:17:53.760 --> 1:17:59.920
 How are you figuring these puzzles out, presumably mostly alone when you were thinking through

1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:01.480
 these problems?

1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:08.780
 Is there, this is a strange question to ask, but what is your thinking process?

1:18:08.780 --> 1:18:11.200
 What is your approach to solving these problems?

1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:16.640
 So the approach is, is you do something and you fuck it up and you're like, you think

1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:20.440
 back, okay, how do I fix that?

1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:26.000
 If you fix that aspect, you commit the crime again and it goes a little bit further and

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:27.000
 it screws up.

1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:28.000
 Okay.

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.000
 How do I fix that?

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.000
 What's the issue on that?

1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:31.000
 How do I fix that?

1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:34.680
 So there's not a deep design thinking like later on, it becomes that once, once you, once

1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:39.280
 you lay that groundwork of the way these schemes are working, all right, it becomes that and

1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:44.720
 you can apply that to other things in, in cyber crime as a whole, all right.

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:48.680
 But initially it's, it's basically trial and error, you know, you've got a problem.

1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:50.640
 How do you solve that problem?

1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:51.640
 All right.

1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:56.560
 So how do I, I'm committing these crimes under my name, how do I solve that?

1:18:56.560 --> 1:19:00.960
 Well, one of the first principles that we started to teach on Shadow Crew is all crimes

1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:04.280
 should begin with identity theft.

1:19:04.280 --> 1:19:07.280
 That's one of the main first principles that a lot of people to this day still don't really

1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:08.280
 get.

1:19:08.280 --> 1:19:09.280
 All right.

1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:12.300
 Why would I commit a crime under my name if I can do it under your name?

1:19:12.300 --> 1:19:15.640
 So that's, that's one of the big buffers and that takes trial and error to get to that

1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:20.240
 point where you start to understand that's the way crimes should operate if you're a

1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:21.240
 criminal.

1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:22.240
 All right.

1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:25.520
 But with me, it was, I mean, it's, it's trial and error.

1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:30.840
 It's, it's that childhood where that mindset is kind of ingrained in you, where you're,

1:19:30.840 --> 1:19:36.480
 you're looking for ways, non, let's say non traditional ways of getting around things

1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:37.800
 or getting through things.

1:19:37.800 --> 1:19:43.560
 I mean, one of the questions probably asked this later is there's also a unique aspect

1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:48.240
 to the outcome of what you were doing, which is you weren't, you know, you didn't get caught

1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:49.800
 for a very long time.

1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:50.800
 Right.

1:19:50.800 --> 1:19:52.200
 We'll talk about why that is.

1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:54.400
 And the thing is, it's so interesting.

1:19:54.400 --> 1:20:00.960
 All, all crime probably should, to be effective, should start with identity theft.

1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:01.960
 Right.

1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:05.280
 I like the identity theft because identity theft can take so many forms.

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:06.280
 Right.

1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:07.280
 Right.

1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:08.280
 So, yeah.

1:20:08.280 --> 1:20:09.280
 So Shadow Crew.

1:20:09.280 --> 1:20:13.400
 So what's, so as we're, you started with love.

1:20:13.400 --> 1:20:18.320
 So now we're, we're, you know, doing these schemes online.

1:20:18.320 --> 1:20:23.200
 I'm selling, I'm selling to these, I'm programming these satellite DSS cards and you, one of

1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:29.000
 the interesting things, and you still see that to this day is something will happen

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:32.880
 that will create an industry for criminals.

1:20:32.880 --> 1:20:33.880
 All right.

1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:38.880
 So what happened is Canada, Canadian judge rules about the same time that I'm doing these

1:20:38.880 --> 1:20:40.960
 satellite satellite cards.

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:47.680
 Canadian judge comes out and says, Hey, it's legal for my citizens to pirate those signals.

1:20:47.680 --> 1:20:52.400
 And his reasoning was, is since RCA doesn't sell the systems up here, my citizens can

1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:53.960
 pirate it.

1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:54.960
 Okay.

1:20:54.960 --> 1:20:59.760
 So what happens is overnight, about the same time PayPal comes into play.

1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:03.480
 So PayPal is coming right online at about the same time.

1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:07.960
 Overnight little cottage industry pops up in the United States, you go down the best buy

1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:12.160
 by the system for $100, take it out in the parking lot, open system up, pull it open box

1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:15.600
 up, pull the system out, pull the card out, throw the system away, program the card, ship

1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:20.280
 it's ass to Canada, $500 a pop started doing that.

1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:23.680
 Business is good, making you know, $3,000, $4,000 a week doing that.

1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:26.200
 I'm like, yeah, that's good.

1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:27.200
 Have so many orders.

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:33.840
 I can't fill all the orders and quickly think to myself, why do I need to fill any of them?

1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:34.920
 They're in Canada.

1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:35.920
 I'm down here.

1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:41.440
 You know, who are they going to complain to because I already found out people don't

1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:42.440
 complain.

1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:43.440
 All right.

1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:45.240
 They're not going to complain to anybody.

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:50.760
 So I start not, especially in Canada, and I'm, I'm, I'm having them send money.

1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:58.200
 That's when PayPal's first into play and it amazes me that everybody is using PayPal.

1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:00.480
 It's like, you don't even have to really ask.

1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:03.760
 They're like, can we pay about, yeah, you can pay all day long by PayPal and PayPal had

1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:06.040
 no clue what they were doing with security.

1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:08.440
 So it's like, okay.

1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:09.840
 So they're sending money to PayPal.

1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:15.640
 I'm having the PayPal cashed out to, uh, to bank accounts in my name at that point and

1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:20.960
 I get scared because by that point I'm still in four to $6,000 a week and I'm like, somebody's

1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:23.660
 going to be looking at money laundering.

1:22:23.660 --> 1:22:24.960
 So get it in my head.

1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:29.840
 I'm like, best thing that I can do is get a fake driver's license, open up a bank account

1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:33.040
 using that driver's license, cash out of the ATM.

1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:34.040
 Good.

1:22:34.040 --> 1:22:36.640
 No idea where to get a fake ID, not a clue.

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:40.840
 So I get online, looked around, spent a couple of weeks looking around, thought I found a

1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:41.840
 guy.

1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:46.720
 He went by the screen name of fake ID man, thought I found a guy, sent him $200, sent

1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:47.720
 him my picture.

1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:48.720
 Dude rips me off.

1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:49.720
 I'm like, what the hell?

1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:50.720
 Oh, I got played.

1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:59.400
 He had a, he had a little website set up with reviews and I'm like, oh, it's all legitimate.

1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:01.920
 He's building that trust that I talked about.

1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:11.760
 So the end result, I got pissed and there was no site that dealt with anything criminal

1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:14.080
 or really cyber crime related.

1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:18.740
 The only real avenue you had was an IRC chat session, internet relay chat.

1:23:18.740 --> 1:23:22.900
 And that, I'm sure you've been on that this, it's this rolling chat board.

1:23:22.900 --> 1:23:25.000
 You don't know who the hell you're talking to.

1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.080
 Most of them are full of shit.

1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:29.640
 You can't trust anybody and you're sitting there trying to conduct business.

1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:32.920
 So you know, if somebody claims they've got a product or service, do they have it?

1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:33.920
 Does it work?

1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:34.920
 Are they just going to rip you off?

1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:39.520
 Because in those channels, they remind us of criminal.

1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:45.240
 I kept looking around and I've happened upon a website called counterfeit library and counterfeit

1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:51.880
 library only dealt with counterfeit degrees and certificates as on a degree, no type stuff,

1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:55.480
 but they had a forum and no one was using the forum.

1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:58.360
 So I basically get on there and bitch every day.

1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:01.720
 I got ripped off, don't want to do, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:05.040
 About the same time I started doing that, two other guys show up.

1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:06.040
 One's named Mr. X.

1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:07.520
 He's out of Los Angeles.

1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:08.800
 Other guys named BL's above.

1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:13.720
 He's out of Moose Jaws, Saskatchewan and we all become buddies.

1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:18.480
 So you know, a few weeks of me bitching, a few weeks of them responding, BL's above gets

1:24:18.480 --> 1:24:20.840
 me on ICQ and he sends me a message.

1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:24.320
 He's like, I went by the screen name of Gollum at that point, Gollum Fun.

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:26.960
 And he's like, Gollum, I can make you a fake driver's license.

1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:28.720
 And I was like, well, motherfucker, do it.

1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:30.640
 And he's like, well, I'm going to charge you for it.

1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:32.440
 I'm like, yeah, you are.

1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:33.440
 He's like, I am.

1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:35.640
 I was like, no, you're not.

1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:41.120
 And he's like, look, man, he said, this business, if you're going to do this, you have to trust

1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:44.160
 people or you're going to fail.

1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:48.640
 He said, so I want to charge you $200, but I'm going to send you a driver's license.

1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:53.200
 Well, by this point, I'm friends with the people who own counterfeit library.

1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:55.720
 We're emailing, chatting, everything else.

1:24:55.720 --> 1:24:59.720
 When I tell him, I'm like, okay, I'm going to send you $200.

1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:03.480
 That way, when you rip me off, I'll have them ban you and I don't have to deal with you

1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:04.480
 anymore.

1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:05.480
 And he's like, bet.

1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:06.480
 I'm like, okay.

1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:09.880
 So I sent him $200, sent him my picture.

1:25:09.880 --> 1:25:11.840
 Two weeks later, I get a driver's license.

1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:17.560
 Name is Stephen Shwecky out of Ohio and a real guy worked at ADP payroll to this day, works

1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:22.880
 at ADP is where the guy works, got the driver's license.

1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:27.280
 And to me, at that point in time, it was the prettiest thing that I'd ever seen.

1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:29.000
 I'd never seen a fake ID before.

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:37.240
 I thought it was great, it turns out, looking back, it's like, eh, so, but it is a kind

1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:42.800
 of a strong first step in creating a fake identity.

1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:43.800
 Very strong.

1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:44.800
 Very strong.

1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:52.720
 So that was like, can I ask you just on the point he made that if you're going to be

1:25:52.720 --> 1:25:57.000
 successful in this, you should have people you trust.

1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.160
 Is he right on that?

1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:00.160
 Always absolutely right.

1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:01.160
 He's absolute.

1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:03.800
 So you have to have, this is like mob.

1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:06.840
 You have to have an inner circle that you trust.

1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:12.120
 You know, I'm sure you've probably heard me say this before.

1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:13.120
 Successful cybercrime.

1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:14.640
 All right.

1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:18.680
 There are three necessities to being successful online if you're a criminal.

1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:24.440
 Three necessities are gathering data, committing the crime, and then cashing it out.

1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:28.520
 All three of those necessities have to work in conjunction if they don't, the crime fails.

1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:34.920
 The problem, and it's a huge problem, is that one guy can't do all three things.

1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:37.360
 You know, you've got the, you've got the people who gather the data.

1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:44.560
 Basically the, the general store sells people who sell PII credit card logins, data tools.

1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:48.560
 They always sell the spoofed phone numbers and the RDPs, stuff like that.

1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:51.560
 A lot of the times those people don't know how to commit the crime, and those people

1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:54.760
 certainly don't know how to launder the money out, put cash in pocket.

1:26:54.760 --> 1:27:01.400
 So you've got, either because of a skill level, sometimes a geographic location limits what

1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:02.760
 that individual can do.

1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:03.760
 All right.

1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:08.800
 So you have to rely on people who are good in areas where you are not in order for that

1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:15.520
 crime to succeed, and that means you have to trust those people.

1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:17.840
 So what happens with Shadow Crew, all right?

1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:21.840
 So Counterfeit Library is the start, all right?

1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:24.760
 Counterfeit Library transitions over to Shadow Crew.

1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:29.680
 Right before that transition, there's a Ukrainian guy by the name of Dmitry Golubov.

1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:31.320
 He was a spammer at that point in time.

1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:36.080
 He saw what we were doing with, with Counterfeit Library, and he liked it.

1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:38.560
 He was getting all these credit card details, and this kid.

1:27:38.560 --> 1:27:40.080
 I mean, he was a kid.

1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:44.320
 This kid has an idea, and his idea was, I wonder if people would buy stolen credit

1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:45.320
 card details.

1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:47.720
 It's pretty good, uh, Ukrainian Russian accent.

1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:54.160
 So he picks up the phone, he calls his buddies, they call their buddies, they have a physical

1:27:54.160 --> 1:27:55.920
 conference in Odessa.

1:27:55.920 --> 1:28:01.480
 150 of these cyber criminals show up, and they launched this idea, they launched a website

1:28:01.480 --> 1:28:06.600
 called Carter Planet, which is the genesis of all modern credit card theft as we know

1:28:06.600 --> 1:28:07.600
 it, all right?

1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:13.040
 So, remember I mentioned those three necessities of cybercrime?

1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:17.720
 Dmitry had all the credit data in the world, and he partnered with all these other Ukrainians

1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:19.640
 who had all this data as well.

1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:24.320
 The problem was, is so much fraud had been committed on that Eastern side of Europe,

1:28:24.320 --> 1:28:26.680
 that every card had been shut down.

1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:30.720
 Even if you were a legitimate card holder, and tried to cash it out, you weren't doing

1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:32.160
 it at that point.

1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:36.400
 So again, those three necessities, gathering data, committing crime, cashing out.

1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:41.800
 Dmitry had the data, they could commit the crime, they could not put cash in pocket.

1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:44.560
 So we were running Counterfeit Library.

1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:50.160
 One day I get this message, or not a message, one day, script shows up, and he posts, just

1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:54.400
 on the general forum, he posts, hey, I've got credit card data.

1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:58.040
 Give me an address, give me a burner phone number, wait five business days, order whatever

1:28:58.040 --> 1:28:59.120
 you want to.

1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:01.400
 We had never seen anything like that.

1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:06.380
 We were a PayPal fraud and eBay fraud side is what we were, and fake driver's licenses.

1:29:06.380 --> 1:29:10.080
 So then, and we had, I guess we had two, three thousand members at that point.

1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:16.280
 So the response from the members was, that can't be real.

1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:19.800
 You've got to be law enforcement, it's got to be trying to get us arrested and everything

1:29:19.800 --> 1:29:20.800
 else.

1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:23.520
 What, let me backtrack a little bit.

1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:28.920
 So the driver's license that I had got, BL's above had an idea.

1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:34.960
 What he wanted to do, is he wanted to sell driver's licenses.

1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:36.680
 He wanted to sell social security cards.

1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:39.320
 He made a very passable social security card.

1:29:39.320 --> 1:29:40.880
 Me, I didn't, I had no skill level on that.

1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:43.000
 I knew PayPal fraud and eBay fraud.

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:47.520
 So BL's above was like, tell you what, you be the reviewer.

1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:50.880
 That way you get every product or service that comes in, they'll have to send it to

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:53.120
 you or let you have access to it.

1:29:53.120 --> 1:29:58.360
 You can learn the entire game, and because you're not selling anything, it gives you

1:29:58.360 --> 1:30:01.440
 legitimacy on the reviews, all right?

1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:02.640
 So I started out as a reviewer.

1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:05.720
 The only reviewer on counterfeit library.

1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:10.200
 So over the next year, BL's above turns out he was a pot grower.

1:30:10.200 --> 1:30:14.480
 He goes back to growing pot because he wasn't making shit selling driver's licenses.

1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:19.920
 Mr. X, about a year and a half in, he gets arrested, cashing out driver's credit card,

1:30:19.920 --> 1:30:24.340
 not credit cards, cashing out to casinos, doing some shit with that.

1:30:24.340 --> 1:30:27.720
 So I'm the only guy left standing and I'm at the top of the heap.

1:30:27.720 --> 1:30:33.960
 So, and it becomes this thing where if I review somebody, they make a lot of money.

1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:36.840
 If I don't, you don't do business here.

1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:38.760
 So script shows up saying he's got this.

1:30:38.760 --> 1:30:41.660
 I'm the only reviewer on site.

1:30:41.660 --> 1:30:44.160
 People think he's law enforcement.

1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:45.720
 First week it goes like that.

1:30:45.720 --> 1:30:48.440
 After a while I'm like, okay, I got to do something and I'm scared, man, because I'm

1:30:48.440 --> 1:30:50.640
 like, he may be law enforcement.

1:30:50.640 --> 1:30:53.160
 So I get him on ICQ and I'm like, hey, you have to be reviewed.

1:30:53.160 --> 1:30:54.840
 He's like, what the hell is that?

1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:55.840
 So I tell him what it is.

1:30:55.840 --> 1:30:56.840
 He's like, you reviewed me.

1:30:56.840 --> 1:30:58.680
 And I was like, yeah, that's the idea.

1:30:58.680 --> 1:31:04.720
 So give him a drop address, give him a burner phone number, wait five business days, and

1:31:04.720 --> 1:31:06.920
 I try to hit Dell for $5,000.

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:08.120
 The order fails.

1:31:08.120 --> 1:31:09.120
 I get back on ICQ.

1:31:09.120 --> 1:31:10.480
 Hey, man, it didn't work.

1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:11.960
 He's like, give me one more chance.

1:31:11.960 --> 1:31:15.040
 I was like, look, I'll give you one more chance, but it's your ass after that.

1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:20.240
 And he's like, one more chance, like, okay, give him another address, another phone number,

1:31:20.240 --> 1:31:26.800
 wait another five business days, hit Thompson's computer warehouse for $4,000, Dell for $5,000.

1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:29.720
 Order goes through, get the products in.

1:31:29.720 --> 1:31:36.680
 I post that review on counterfeit library and literally overnight we turn from an eBay

1:31:36.680 --> 1:31:43.480
 PayPal fraud site to a credit theft site and that becomes a lot of money really quickly

1:31:43.480 --> 1:31:44.480
 for members.

1:31:44.480 --> 1:31:47.680
 So we were doing, now it's called a CMP fraud card, not present fraud.

1:31:47.680 --> 1:31:51.400
 So you hit, you use, hit an online merchant with stolen credit card data.

1:31:51.400 --> 1:31:58.880
 Back then a fairly experienced fraudster could profit $30,000 to $40,000 a month, okay?

1:31:58.880 --> 1:32:01.960
 Just buying, you know, laptops, what have you and cashing out, you know, put them on

1:32:01.960 --> 1:32:07.120
 eBay for sale and sell them like that and 30 to 40 a month was the profit on that.

1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:08.520
 Script had a lot of buddies.

1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:13.640
 He had people like Roman Vega, these other guys that would sell not just credit card

1:32:13.640 --> 1:32:17.400
 data, but counterfeit physical credit cards as well.

1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:20.120
 We had counterfeit not stolen.

1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:25.240
 So counterfeit that must be tough to do.

1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:28.760
 So the connection must be harder than driver's license crazy.

1:32:28.760 --> 1:32:30.080
 So you know, in your back.

1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:37.240
 So what's what Boa initially had, and I became the, the United States salesperson for Boa,

1:32:37.240 --> 1:32:42.480
 but what he had was, is he was the first dumps provider in the United States.

1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:47.760
 So on the back of your credit or debit card, there's a magnetic stripe, three data tracks

1:32:47.760 --> 1:32:48.760
 on the stripe.

1:32:48.760 --> 1:32:50.640
 The first data track is a customer's name.

1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:56.120
 Second data track is the card number forward slash 16 digit algorithm outside of that.

1:32:56.120 --> 1:32:57.120
 That's important.

1:32:57.120 --> 1:32:58.640
 We'll get back to that in a few minutes.

1:32:58.640 --> 1:33:00.560
 Third data track is called indiscriminate data.

1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:01.560
 No one uses it.

1:33:01.560 --> 1:33:02.560
 All right.

1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:05.760
 So what's bought and sold is the second data track.

1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:06.760
 It's called the dump.

1:33:06.760 --> 1:33:11.920
 And the reason that's sold is when you go into a shop, you insert the card or you swipe

1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:12.920
 the card.

1:33:12.920 --> 1:33:16.640
 The only information that's sent out for verification is the second data track.

1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:17.640
 All right.

1:33:17.640 --> 1:33:19.800
 That's the processor bank for verification.

1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:24.360
 The first data track that customer's name shows up on the screen of the cashier in front

1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:25.360
 of you.

1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:30.640
 So what typically happens is, is you buy 10 of these dumps, you get 10 counterfeit cards,

1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:35.480
 encode track two on all 10 cards, track one, you create one fake driver's license.

1:33:35.480 --> 1:33:38.200
 Track one is just the name of that one fake driver's license.

1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:42.240
 That way when you go in the shop, swipe the card, track two, get sent off a verification.

1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:44.240
 Track one shows up on the screen in front of the cashier.

1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:48.880
 If you're a raspberry ID, you pull out the fake ID, everyone's an ice warm fuzzy.

1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:52.960
 You walk out with cameras, Rolex and track one could be eight.

1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:54.160
 It doesn't have to be connected.

1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:55.240
 It's not connected to track two.

1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:56.240
 Not connected at all.

1:33:56.240 --> 1:33:57.240
 All right.

1:33:57.240 --> 1:33:58.840
 That's, that's one of the big problems.

1:33:58.840 --> 1:33:59.840
 All right.

1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:00.840
 Yeah.

1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:07.680
 So script brought a host of technical people into that type of environment, all committing

1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:08.680
 credit card theft.

1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:10.240
 We had proxy providers.

1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:13.200
 We had all these people that were doing this stuff.

1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:15.640
 We start making a lot of money, a lot.

1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:21.280
 And the reason that happens is again, script did not have the ability to cash out.

1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:25.760
 So he was reduced to selling things and at the same time he's looking for, how do I make

1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:26.760
 more money?

1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:28.240
 All right.

1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:35.280
 The Ukrainians happened upon this thing called the CVV one breach or hack is what they call

1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:36.280
 it.

1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:42.440
 So what happens is, remember, I told you of track two card number forward slash 16 digit

1:34:42.440 --> 1:34:48.120
 algorithm, you got to know the algorithm to encode it so you can swipe the card or take

1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:49.120
 it to the ATM machine.

1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:50.120
 All right.

1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:51.120
 ATM.

1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:52.880
 You got to know it.

1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:54.760
 Now we were fishing data from hell.

1:34:54.760 --> 1:34:58.640
 I mean, we were, we were doing a lot of fishing, a lot.

1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:03.760
 We were getting pins, we were getting card numbers, but you can't get that algorithm.

1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:07.080
 So the Ukrainians start testing stuff.

1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:13.840
 What they found out was no bank had implemented the hash on track two.

1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:19.680
 So you take the card number forward slash any 16 digits, it would encode, take it to

1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:23.040
 the ATM, pull cash out because you got the pin.

1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:24.540
 All right.

1:35:24.540 --> 1:35:25.540
 Started doing that.

1:35:25.540 --> 1:35:28.720
 Well, wait, uh, sorry, I'm trying to understand.

1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:35.680
 So that means, so if there's no hat, are they generating random numbers or do they have valid

1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:37.160
 numbers for track two?

1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:38.360
 No numbers needed at all.

1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:41.880
 As long as just the track two was a complete track two.

1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:45.720
 So it's a valid track two that doesn't match.

1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:48.600
 So the pin is the thing that gets you in back.

1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:53.000
 So back then, all right, back then what we're talking about is you needed typically today

1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:54.360
 you need a whole track two.

1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:56.080
 You need that valid track to, all right.

1:35:56.080 --> 1:36:00.600
 You need the, you need the 16 digit card number forward slash and then whatever that

1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:02.360
 algorithm is the opposite of it.

1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:03.360
 All right.

1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:06.840
 So back then, none of the banks had implemented that algorithm.

1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:12.040
 So while the algorithm was there, you didn't need it to encode.

1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:14.040
 Interesting.

1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:15.040
 Interesting.

1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:22.640
 So you can make a lot of money, uh, with, uh, physical, uh, so much money that card not

1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:27.680
 present cards, card not present fraud, remember I told you was 30 to $40,000 a month.

1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:28.680
 All right.

1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:31.960
 That turned into $30 to $40,000 a day.

1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:32.960
 Yeah.

1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:36.840
 The Ukrainians, again, they can't cash it out.

1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:39.280
 They've got all the data on the planet, but they can't cash it out.

1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:41.480
 Those three necessities of cyber crime.

1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:46.680
 So the deal became you have to rely on the Americans tell you what, we'll give you 40%.

1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:51.160
 So you had all these cashiers that were 40% of $40,000 a day.

1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:52.320
 Yeah, we'll take that.

1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:53.520
 All right.

1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:58.000
 Send the rest of it over to by Western Union or what have you to your Ukrainian contact.

1:36:58.000 --> 1:36:59.720
 That's before cryptocurrency came into play.

1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:04.520
 Now you had a couple of forerunners with E Gold and Liberty Reserve, things like that.

1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:09.800
 But back then it starts out with Western Union, then it becomes prepaid cards, sending track

1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:12.280
 information over, loading the card up like that.

1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:16.520
 And then finally you get to E Gold, Liberty Reserve and today it's with crypto that's

1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:26.680
 that's used, um, started stealing a lot of money a lot and that got law enforcement attention.

1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:30.440
 So we started to see, I mean, just, it's a crazy story.

1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:35.880
 We started to see, uh, IPs coming in from law enforcement agencies, government agencies,

1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:38.360
 because back then they didn't know how to shield their identity either.

1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:44.680
 So you saw, you saw Secret Service, you saw DOD, you saw all these like, and you're like,

1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:45.680
 that's interesting.

1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:54.240
 And, uh, at the same time, we had, um, it was called a hack, but it wasn't a hack.

1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:58.960
 We had a guy that worked at T mobile in Los Angeles.

1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:05.080
 This is the same guy that back then published Paris Hilton's phone contact list that made

1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:07.320
 a lot of news.

1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:12.320
 Not only did he do that, but it turned out that the Los Angeles Secret Service agency

1:38:12.320 --> 1:38:14.320
 was using T mobile phones.

1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:20.440
 So he's getting text messages of the Secret Service investigating shadow crew and he posts

1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:21.880
 those damn things on shadow crew.

1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:23.840
 So I'm sitting there going head of the pile.

1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:27.120
 I'm sitting there going, this is not going to end well.

1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:28.720
 This is not going to end well.

1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:34.400
 So at the same time I had access, I started out with access to the, uh, Indiana state

1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:38.520
 sex offenders registry and I was using that to create bank accounts, a lot of money out

1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:42.040
 and I would sell the bank accounts, stuff like that.

1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:43.120
 They shut that down.

1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:48.280
 The next database I had access to was the Texas driver's license database and started

1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:52.220
 using that to create fake driver's licenses, what have you.

1:38:52.220 --> 1:38:59.200
 And then finally we happened upon the California death index, all right.

1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:00.200
 Complete information.

1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:06.040
 Mothers, maiden, socials, DOBs, all that and it's like, gotta be a use for that.

1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:09.760
 Well, you can use it to create identities all day long.

1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:17.760
 My idea was I wonder if you could take somebody that's died and then file for social security

1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:21.160
 death benefit, not death benefits, but social security benefits for that individual and

1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:23.280
 get that recurring paycheck in.

1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:26.880
 So that takes a lot of research to start seeing if you can do that.

1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:29.560
 How does the federal government know if you're dead?

1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:32.400
 Do federal indexes reference state indexes?

1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:34.920
 You got all these questions that pop up.

1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:39.320
 Well, it turns out federal indexes don't reference state indexes against the law.

1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:46.200
 So it also turns out the only way the federal government knows you're dead is prior to 1998

1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:54.040
 the family had to file a social security death benefit for that person, all right.

1:39:54.040 --> 1:39:55.040
 Prior to 1998.

1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:56.040
 Of course, most people don't.

1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:57.040
 Right.

1:39:57.040 --> 1:39:58.920
 Prior to 1998, it took the family.

1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:03.600
 After 98, the hospital can do it, funeral home can do it, or the family can do it.

1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:06.600
 So a lot more people have it filed after if they've died.

1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:10.920
 But it's still, there's a lot of people, a lot of people don't because that death benefits

1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:12.920
 only like $219.

1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:13.920
 Yeah.

1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:14.920
 Okay.

1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:15.920
 Nobody's thinking about that shit.

1:40:15.920 --> 1:40:19.200
 So I started to apply for social security benefits.

1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:20.200
 Nope.

1:40:20.200 --> 1:40:21.880
 Numbers dormant.

1:40:21.880 --> 1:40:23.880
 So they want you to come in for a physical interview.

1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:28.440
 Here I am, you know, 32, you're not going to pass as a 65 year old.

1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:29.680
 So no.

1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:37.240
 So the next idea I had was wonder if you could file income tax returns on these people.

1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:40.480
 Turns out you can all day long.

1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:42.400
 So I started doing that.

1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:46.480
 And I started to steal once I got ramped up because you test everything, you know, you're

1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:50.800
 testing and make sure you got to figure out what the deposit instrument is and everything

1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:51.800
 else.

1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:56.880
 And once you get all that lined out, I started to steal $160,000 a week, every week for 10

1:40:56.880 --> 1:40:58.680
 months out of the year.

1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:00.920
 By paying taxes.

1:41:00.920 --> 1:41:05.200
 By filing fake, uh, yeah, filing fake tax returns.

1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:10.680
 So you find a business and the way the system worked is the IRS will issue a refund on

1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:15.640
 somebody before they're able to verify that that person worked for an employer.

1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:17.160
 Still works like that today.

1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:18.160
 All right.

1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:21.680
 So, and you keep in the amounts relatively low, keep them at $3,000.

1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:23.680
 All right.

1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:24.680
 Mounts are very low.

1:41:24.680 --> 1:41:27.200
 You're still able to achieve scale because this is large index of real.

1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:31.120
 I got to where, and I was manual later on, a couple of buddies of mine went automated

1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:32.120
 with it.

1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:33.120
 Wait.

1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:34.120
 You would go and do this by hand.

1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:35.120
 So there's no code involved.

1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:36.120
 All manual.

1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:37.120
 Wow.

1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:39.560
 I'd file a return once every six minutes.

1:41:39.560 --> 1:41:42.240
 Like 10 hours a day, three days a week.

1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:46.760
 So clicking on, so to typing fast and click one return every six minutes.

1:41:46.760 --> 1:41:50.560
 That's changing IP and that's, uh, changing address, everything else will return every

1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:54.280
 six minutes for three days a week.

1:41:54.280 --> 1:42:00.860
 Fourth day I would take a road trip, plot out a map of ATMs and then the next two days

1:42:00.860 --> 1:42:02.800
 cash out, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:03.800
 All right.

1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:09.000
 Come back home, rinse and repeat, um, turns out that a backpack, I don't see anything sitting

1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:14.520
 around here, but a backpack will hold $150,000 of 20s is what it will hold.

1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:16.640
 So I put 150K in 20s in a backpack.

1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:18.200
 I had a spare bedroom.

1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:21.080
 I'd come in, toss the backpack in the bedroom.

1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:23.120
 This is very, very important information.

1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:26.720
 And the fact that you know it is, uh, is also very, first we started with the volume of

1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:33.080
 cold that weighs a ton and now a backpack holds $150,000 of 20s and then you can multiply

1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:34.680
 that by five for hundreds.

1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:35.680
 Yeah.

1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:36.680
 Uh, I like this.

1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:39.920
 It's 20s, most of the time it's 20s coming out at ATM, right?

1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:42.200
 Each 20 ways a gram.

1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:43.960
 Each 20 ways a gram.

1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:48.080
 So you can actually go by weight, which is what federal authorities do when they get

1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:49.080
 a pallet of cash.

1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:50.080
 They just weigh it.

1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:52.280
 Oh, they just, they just weigh it.

1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:55.480
 So 150K is seven and a half keys of cash.

1:42:55.480 --> 1:42:59.040
 A half feet, 15, oh, that's pretty light.

1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:00.040
 Not bad.

1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:01.040
 Not bad.

1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:02.040
 Do you get big backpack?

1:43:02.040 --> 1:43:05.040
 Do you go to run with David Goggins with it?

1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:07.040
 I like it.

1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:08.600
 The fact, you know, this is great.

1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:11.400
 So wait, uh, what, where does that come in with the backpack?

1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:13.680
 So what happens is I didn't know how to launder money.

1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:14.680
 All right.

1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:17.440
 So, you know, I'm throwing cash in the spare bedroom.

1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:21.960
 One day you open up the bedroom and you're like, gotta do something with those backpacks.

1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:26.440
 And that's when you start learning how to launder money, you know, cash based businesses, things

1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:27.440
 like that.

1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:29.480
 I had a production company, had a couple of detailing company.

1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:33.240
 I was thinking about going to the food trucks, things like that and trust us.

1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:35.440
 So can you pause on that to take a tangent there?

1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:37.760
 How does money laundering work?

1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:42.360
 I mean, at that time and what years are we talking about?

1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:49.600
 This is, uh, by the time the tax return schemes go into play, we're talking, uh, 2002, 2003

1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:51.120
 is when tax returns start.

1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:57.160
 And so what, uh, at that time and what you're aware of now, how it evolved, how does money,

1:43:57.160 --> 1:43:59.480
 money laundering work?

1:43:59.480 --> 1:44:00.760
 You know, it's not that much different.

1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:01.760
 It's really not.

1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:05.760
 And you, you get a cash based business, start laundering the money or putting the money

1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:08.200
 through that, saying the transactions are legal.

1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:13.200
 You, uh, then start depositing into bank accounts from bank accounts.

1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:20.520
 My thing was is have bank accounts in the United States, Mexico, Canada, and then finally

1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:24.080
 bounce over to Estonia was the final destination of all this stuff.

1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:30.320
 And the idea is to try to move them to so many places that by the end of the day it

1:44:30.320 --> 1:44:36.480
 looks legal and you can't trace it all if you're ever caught, which you ultimately are.

1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:40.320
 But, um, so cash based businesses, you know, when you say, sorry to interrupt the cash

1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:47.600
 based businesses, so you have money that needs to be moved to other people.

1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:52.920
 Uh, uh, so how does that work with, what's the business, providing your service and you're

1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:54.480
 giving them money?

1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:55.480
 Right.

1:44:55.480 --> 1:44:56.480
 So you, you do the Ozark thing.

1:44:56.480 --> 1:44:57.480
 If you want to do that.

1:44:57.480 --> 1:45:01.640
 So you can gamble cash out something like that, so it trips to whatever casinos you've

1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:02.640
 got.

1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:06.000
 You've got your production company or your detail company.

1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.160
 So how many cars you're cleaning today?

1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:10.160
 How many companies have you got to do that?

1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:11.160
 All right.

1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:13.960
 Uh, whatever that company is, it's got to be cash based.

1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:17.000
 Somebody's paying you in cash is what you're doing.

1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:20.600
 You have to have enough of those cash based businesses where it doesn't look funny.

1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:21.600
 All right.

1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:25.360
 Because if you're a detailed company, make a hundred thousand dollars a month, that's

1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:26.360
 a problem.

1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:27.360
 Yeah.

1:45:27.360 --> 1:45:28.360
 Okay.

1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:30.640
 So then you start depositing into that.

1:45:30.640 --> 1:45:38.120
 Well, because of the Patriot Act, a suspicious activity report, SARS came in at $2,500 instead

1:45:38.120 --> 1:45:40.480
 of the 10K that it used to be.

1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:43.480
 So all of a sudden you've got multiple bank accounts that you've got to set up.

1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:44.480
 All right.

1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:48.320
 Fortunately, what you also had is you had a bunch of prepaid debit cards that were coming

1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:49.960
 into play at the same time.

1:45:49.960 --> 1:45:55.880
 So combination of bank accounts, prepaid debits that have had ACH abilities attached to those

1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:56.880
 as well.

1:45:56.880 --> 1:45:58.480
 And you start running them all together.

1:45:58.480 --> 1:46:01.360
 Then once it's out of the United States, you don't have to worry as much.

1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:06.440
 You can start funneling that into fewer bank accounts until finally you've got the one

1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:13.040
 main account that's over at Bank LaTico and Estonia at that point is what you've got.

1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:16.480
 So a bunch of hops that end up in a place that you can't trace.

1:46:16.480 --> 1:46:19.920
 And to give you an idea, I was arrested February 8th, 2005.

1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:23.000
 My last seizure was 2010.

1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:24.400
 Got the last seizure notice.

1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:30.880
 So they got it, but it took them that long to get to it.

1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:38.000
 So how do stories like with script that come into play here where he had someone who owed

1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:40.200
 him money kidnapped and tortured?

1:46:40.200 --> 1:46:45.240
 So when does it turn darker?

1:46:45.240 --> 1:46:49.120
 It turns darker when the more money you make.

1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:54.400
 script was a kid that he was stealing enough money that he was able to buy whatever estate

1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:55.400
 he wanted to.

1:46:55.400 --> 1:46:58.120
 And he would brag about touring the countryside.

1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:01.200
 And if he saw property that he liked, he would buy it.

1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:02.560
 And that was not just a brag.

1:47:02.560 --> 1:47:03.960
 He was doing that.

1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:06.600
 So this kid is stealing a lot of money at the same time.

1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:10.060
 He's got connections politically because of his family.

1:47:10.060 --> 1:47:13.640
 He's got connections and that family's got connections with the Ukrainian mob.

1:47:13.640 --> 1:47:14.640
 All right.

1:47:14.640 --> 1:47:18.800
 So he's got these inroads and people are looking out for him and he's stealing a lot of money

1:47:18.800 --> 1:47:20.520
 at the same time.

1:47:20.520 --> 1:47:24.720
 Somebody doesn't pay him a decent amount of money.

1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:25.720
 Somebody doesn't pay him.

1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:30.800
 Now we had never with shadow crew, with Carter planet, with counterfeit library.

1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:32.760
 We were basically the geeks.

1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:33.760
 All right.

1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:37.020
 We were just the fraudsters, the social engineers.

1:47:37.020 --> 1:47:38.880
 We had never really considered violence.

1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:43.280
 The rules that I had in play were, Hey, we're not, we don't do child pornography.

1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:45.440
 We don't do counterfeit currency.

1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:46.880
 We don't do drugs.

1:47:46.880 --> 1:47:51.520
 And the only thing we ended up really obeying was the child porn stuff, except for max butler

1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:59.720
 who you mentioned earlier, um, script, someone rips the guy off and, uh, he comes online

1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:04.560
 on shadow crew at that point and he posts these pictures one day.

1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:09.320
 And I mean, it was a detailed narrative through the pictures had the guy that rammed in the

1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:14.600
 van, had the door open, rammed in, rammed in the van, had the guy tied up, had the guy

1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:22.640
 being tortured and, uh, the response was, this is what happens when you steal from me.

1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:28.520
 And that's the, that's the first time that violence came into play at that point.

1:48:28.520 --> 1:48:32.600
 That's when things got, you start realizing things are getting a little serious.

1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:34.880
 How did that make you feel?

1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:38.080
 The first response is can't be real.

1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:44.240
 He's, he's just, that's, he's just doing that, you know, he's wanting to send a message.

1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:47.760
 And you're like, no, that's real.

1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:48.760
 That's real.

1:48:48.760 --> 1:48:55.240
 And, uh, were you afraid in your own heart that you might, uh, descend to that too?

1:48:55.240 --> 1:49:01.280
 Like if you see that, or was it pretty clear to you that that's, that's a line that some

1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:05.120
 people can cross and some can't, and you're not one of those that can cross it.

1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:11.600
 You know, I gotta tell you, I, I joke with my wife, the, the joke I give, the joke I

1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:17.000
 tell my wife is, you know, if I knew some guy that had 8,000 bitcoins, I might be persuaded

1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.600
 to ask him for access to that.

1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:20.600
 And she was like, how?

1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:22.840
 And I was like, well, hammer and toes.

1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:23.840
 Yeah.

1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:32.760
 And, uh, I say that as a joke, but there's that line where you're like, I remember who

1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:34.760
 I used to be.

1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:41.280
 And if you're looking at that kind of money, I might be persuaded to do that back then.

1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:48.160
 You know, that's, that's, and I think that's what was Scripps issue is he, it was a lot

1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:49.160
 of money to him.

1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:50.160
 It's the money.

1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:53.400
 And then there's, you know, violence can also be gradual.

1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:56.440
 So over time you do a little more, a little more, a little more, a little more.

1:49:56.440 --> 1:50:00.680
 You get used to what's going on and then I get desensitized and you figure, you take

1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:06.200
 somebody like, uh, like Ross Ulbrich, the, the Silk Road guy, all right.

1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:08.440
 Ross was not a violent guy.

1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:09.440
 He was not.

1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:13.280
 You know, he was sitting on 24, 24 million in Bitcoin.

1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:19.280
 He was the only game in town and that 24 now is like, I don't know, 22, 24 billion, some

1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:20.780
 crap like that.

1:50:20.780 --> 1:50:29.200
 But, uh, he felt in danger of this guy was going to turn him in, you know, as a black

1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:30.200
 mountain and everything.

1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:35.000
 So Ross thinks he hires a couple hit men to kill the guy.

1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:36.800
 So it's, it's, it becomes that thing.

1:50:36.800 --> 1:50:42.940
 And I saw that over and over again and I'd like to say I wasn't like that, but given

1:50:42.940 --> 1:50:46.560
 the same circumstances, I would have probably done the same thing.

1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:49.240
 And also when you're, it's not just about money.

1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:50.360
 There's a lot of other forces.

1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:57.040
 Like if you're threatened, um, for your wellbeing or for your wealth or for your power, all,

1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:01.840
 all of us operate under different motivations, plus that, that online aspect for those communities

1:51:01.840 --> 1:51:06.500
 like that, if you're the head guy, you really feel like you're the parent of these guys.

1:51:06.500 --> 1:51:07.960
 So somebody's starting to threaten them.

1:51:07.960 --> 1:51:10.560
 It's like, all right, what do I need to do?

1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:11.960
 So what do you make of Silk Road?

1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:18.000
 See the, uh, shadow crew started something that today you can call dark net and dark

1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:19.000
 net markets.

1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:27.160
 So these markets that operate that trade, uh, trade things, everything from child pornography

1:51:27.160 --> 1:51:32.520
 to drugs to, um, I mean, what else?

1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:36.680
 What are the dark things that humans want to do that they don't want anyone to know about

1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:38.760
 all of those things?

1:51:38.760 --> 1:51:45.320
 Um, so can you maybe tell me, you know what, let's just even step back.

1:51:45.320 --> 1:51:46.320
 What is the dark net?

1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:47.840
 How big is it?

1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:48.840
 What happens there?

1:51:48.840 --> 1:51:52.080
 Well, let's, let's backtrack a little bit more before we get to that.

1:51:52.080 --> 1:51:53.080
 All right.

1:51:53.080 --> 1:52:02.280
 Um, what shadow crew did other than, you know, dealing in all these stolen wares, what shadow

1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:05.200
 crew did, that's really important.

1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:10.440
 Remember those three necessities that I talked about, but the important thing is, is it established

1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:13.440
 trust among criminals, all right?

1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:14.440
 Because that's a necessity.

1:52:14.440 --> 1:52:19.440
 You have to be able to trust who you're dealing with because you have to deal with somebody.

1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:20.440
 You have to.

1:52:20.440 --> 1:52:21.440
 All right.

1:52:21.440 --> 1:52:23.640
 So how do you know you're not dealing with a cop?

1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:25.640
 How do you know you're dealing with somebody that's skilled?

1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:27.640
 How do you know you're going to deal with somebody that's not going to rip you off?

1:52:27.640 --> 1:52:30.460
 You have to be able to trust that individual.

1:52:30.460 --> 1:52:33.080
 No crew provided that trust mechanism for criminals.

1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:38.200
 You had that communication channel with forums where you could reference conversations, weeks,

1:52:38.200 --> 1:52:41.440
 months old, take part, learn from those conversations.

1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:46.320
 You had vouching systems and review systems in place, escrow systems in place.

1:52:46.320 --> 1:52:50.320
 You had, you could, you know, by looking at someone's screen name, if you could trust

1:52:50.320 --> 1:52:53.440
 the individual, network with the individual, all right?

1:52:53.440 --> 1:53:01.280
 And that community of just humans provided that backbone of trust.

1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:04.200
 And that's, that's really interesting when you think about it.

1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:11.280
 You had the trust that was there, but you also had this, almost this instantaneous information

1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:16.000
 that was available about the community or about cyber crime at large, and that's, that's

1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.160
 still in play today, all right?

1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:23.560
 So when that, that was the way things were until a couple of things happened.

1:53:23.560 --> 1:53:25.680
 And one was cryptocurrency.

1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:29.000
 The other one was the tour browser, the dark web.

1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:33.600
 Now I was working with the secret service, ripping the secret service off when tour comes

1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:34.600
 into play.

1:53:34.600 --> 1:53:35.600
 All right.

1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:39.080
 So we got a, we got a memo in one day and it was talking about the tour browser and

1:53:39.080 --> 1:53:41.960
 it was like, we really need to be careful with this.

1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:43.600
 This is going to be problem.

1:53:43.600 --> 1:53:45.960
 And so we all fired up the tour browser.

1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:50.720
 And it turns out it was, this was 2005, early six.

1:53:50.720 --> 1:53:54.520
 Turns out it was completely unusable, could not use it at all, simply because no one was

1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:56.560
 using it and it was extremely slow.

1:53:56.560 --> 1:54:01.520
 So for people that don't know tour browser is the way to be completely anonymous.

1:54:01.520 --> 1:54:03.720
 As long as you properly know how to use it, right?

1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:04.720
 Huge caveat.

1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:05.720
 Yeah.

1:54:05.720 --> 1:54:06.720
 All right.

1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:08.000
 So developed by the United States Navy.

1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:09.000
 And they developed it.

1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:10.000
 I know this.

1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:11.000
 I did not.

1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:12.000
 Oh yeah.

1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:13.000
 It wasn't the hackers that.

1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:14.000
 Interesting.

1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:19.480
 To this day, the number one funder of tour military to this day.

1:54:19.480 --> 1:54:20.480
 All right.

1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:21.480
 Interesting.

1:54:21.480 --> 1:54:26.320
 I mean, the same, I guess with the internet, the, the, the origins are so developed so that

1:54:26.320 --> 1:54:30.280
 operatives could communicate with each other without being identified.

1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:31.280
 All right.

1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:33.200
 That then goes open source.

1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:38.440
 They release it, EFF comes in, start sponsoring and everything else like that.

1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:42.800
 The next idea was, well, you know, people can get around their country's firewalls, whistle

1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:44.240
 blowers can use it, things like that.

1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:49.000
 Well, someone forgot to mention that the first adoptees of tech, if you can use it to launder

1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:53.040
 money or remain anonymous are criminals.

1:54:53.040 --> 1:54:55.440
 So criminals start to use the damn thing.

1:54:55.440 --> 1:54:56.760
 All right.

1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:02.440
 So along the same time we get, well, a few years later, we get Satoshi Nakamoto pops up

1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:07.760
 with his ideas for Bitcoin and then Ross Ulbrich runs with it.

1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:10.200
 Ross Ulbrich decides he's going to start up Silk Road.

1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:15.680
 So initially the people who were using tour, which later is the dark web, people were using

1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:16.680
 tour.

1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:21.840
 We're just talking with each other, visiting websites, communicating like that.

1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:26.600
 Someone figured out, Hey man, we could host websites on this thing and they have a lot

1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:29.120
 of trouble finding the box.

1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:35.320
 So that is the advent of Silk Road all of a sudden, Ross Ulbrich has this idea that he's

1:55:35.320 --> 1:55:41.100
 going to change the world by becoming the largest drug dealer on the planet.

1:55:41.100 --> 1:55:46.640
 So he opens up the Silk Road and the only payment instrument he allows is Bitcoin.

1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:51.360
 So if those people out there are wondering why Bitcoin is going at what, 44K today?

1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:52.360
 Yeah.

1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:53.360
 Yeah.

1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:54.360
 Starts up.

1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:56.200
 By the time this is out, it could be 100,000 or 10,000.

1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:57.200
 Absolutely.

1:55:57.200 --> 1:55:58.200
 Absolutely.

1:55:58.200 --> 1:55:59.200
 Who knows?

1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:04.080
 If it's 10,000, I'm going to buy some.

1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:09.200
 Which is a hilarious statement to make because that statement would be ridiculously wrong

1:56:09.200 --> 1:56:10.280
 like five years ago.

1:56:10.280 --> 1:56:11.280
 I know.

1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:12.280
 I know.

1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:13.280
 I know.

1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:18.600
 People a hundred years from now will be laughing, wait, it was that low?

1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:24.640
 So he only accepts Bitcoin and that's of course the initial use case of crypto is no one

1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:30.880
 wants to admit it today, but the initial use case is we're going to buy a bunch of pot.

1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:33.640
 We need somebody, we need a way to pay for it.

1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:37.480
 So that's, that's what happens, Ross.

1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:43.280
 It's really interesting to me if you, if you look at motivations of cyber criminals, the

1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:46.720
 motivations are status, cash, ideology.

1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:48.080
 All right.

1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:54.720
 My guys all cash across the board, all cash, Ross is ideology.

1:56:54.720 --> 1:56:57.120
 He really believed he was going to change the world.

1:56:57.120 --> 1:56:58.120
 He really didn't.

1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:05.000
 Unfortunately, I, I actually know the guy who ran Silk Road to and have talked to the

1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.320
 kid, everything else.

1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:14.240
 And I will tell you that those, those guys who are motivated by ideology, they are a

1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:16.080
 completely different breed.

1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:17.200
 They really are.

1:57:17.200 --> 1:57:24.120
 It's not, you know, the cash guy, it's, it's, it's low hanging fruit, the, the ease of, of

1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:29.280
 it's hard to stop committing crime, but it's much easier for a cash motivated individual

1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:35.120
 to stop than it is that ideology guy, um, that Silk Road two guy, he's still got it.

1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:41.480
 You know, he's not breaking the law, but you can see it's like, he wants to, he wants to.

1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:42.840
 So it's, it's, um,

1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:49.360
 That's fascinating that I mean the worst atrocities in human history are committed with people

1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:53.280
 that operate under ideology, all the other motivations are much weaker.

1:57:53.280 --> 1:57:59.800
 But you know, you think about it with Ross, I mean, very bright guy, very bright guy,

1:57:59.800 --> 1:58:04.960
 but think about the amount of cognitive dissonance that the guy's got, that he thinks he's going

1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:09.640
 to change the world by running a drug site.

1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:13.080
 I mean, certainly, I mean, could he have changed the world?

1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:14.080
 Yeah.

1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:16.280
 Could he have done it like that?

1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:17.280
 Probably not.

1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:19.320
 Well, I get, I get steel man, those arguments.

1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:26.000
 I listen to quite a few, uh, libertarians and you can push that to anarchists and you

1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:31.200
 know, there's a lot of people that argue, um, so I actually talked to, uh, to, to faculty,

1:58:31.200 --> 1:58:35.400
 to professor Columbia, who actually argues that all drugs should be legalized and not

1:58:35.400 --> 1:58:40.800
 at a philosophical level, political level, but the fact that, um, all the negative consequences

1:58:40.800 --> 1:58:47.200
 of drugs that people talk about, uh, actually have to do with other factors in your life.

1:58:47.200 --> 1:58:48.200
 I would agree with that.

1:58:48.200 --> 1:58:53.600
 And so that's a, okay, but that's more like a argument about negative aspects of drugs.

1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:59.360
 I think the ideology comes in where it's like, well, nobody should tell you what to do.

1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:06.680
 You should be, you should have the responsibility of your own actions, like, uh, um, the government

1:59:06.680 --> 1:59:13.200
 or any other institution shouldn't be the, uh, the rule setters, the constraints for

1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:14.680
 how you live your life.

1:59:14.680 --> 1:59:20.040
 And so that, I could, I could see that argument being made and ultimately if you, uh, like

1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:25.200
 create an open market for drugs, how that could build a better society, it might break

1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:30.920
 down the outdated, the corrupt, the bureaucratic institutions, I mean, you can make, you can

1:59:30.920 --> 1:59:31.920
 make that argument.

1:59:31.920 --> 1:59:32.920
 There's an argument.

1:59:32.920 --> 1:59:33.920
 And let's be fair.

1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:34.920
 I want to be fair with it.

1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:38.320
 I mean, could, did he change the world?

1:59:38.320 --> 1:59:40.320
 We do have this whole thing called cryptocurrency.

1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:41.320
 Yeah.

1:59:41.320 --> 1:59:43.880
 In the long arc of history, perhaps, yeah.

1:59:43.880 --> 1:59:48.200
 We do have that, that's a biggie.

1:59:48.200 --> 1:59:51.720
 And that might, might have been for it to take hold in society, maybe the darker parts

1:59:51.720 --> 1:59:53.200
 of society at first.

1:59:53.200 --> 1:59:54.200
 Maybe that was necessary.

1:59:54.200 --> 1:59:55.200
 Right.

1:59:55.200 --> 2:00:00.000
 I mean, maybe we'll see how it pans out, um, shadow crew.

2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:04.680
 We had this guy, Albert Gonzalez, it's a kid's name.

2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:11.320
 We had, we were growing so big that, um, I had to start farming things out.

2:00:11.320 --> 2:00:17.360
 So the first thing I started farming, I instituted this review system, kind of establishing that

2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:21.600
 trust mechanism even further for criminals use.

2:00:21.600 --> 2:00:26.040
 We needed somebody to take care of our tech aspects of the forum.

2:00:26.040 --> 2:00:30.440
 So, um, associate of mine by the name of Kim Taylor, where we're looking for a forum

2:00:30.440 --> 2:00:31.440
 techie.

2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:34.640
 He comes to me one night and he's like, uh, founder forum techie, and I was like, who's

2:00:34.640 --> 2:00:35.640
 that?

2:00:35.640 --> 2:00:36.640
 And he's like, uh, it's this kid.

2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:37.640
 And I was like, is he good?

2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:38.640
 He's like, well, he knows the software.

2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:39.640
 And I was like, okay.

2:00:39.640 --> 2:00:43.160
 We just signed his ass on.

2:00:43.160 --> 2:00:48.640
 He went by the screen name of a Kamba Johnny was his screen name and, um, he starts selling

2:00:48.640 --> 2:00:55.600
 credit cards after a while under a screen name of Scarface and, uh, that CV one breach

2:00:55.600 --> 2:01:02.120
 where you're cashing out the track twos at ATMs, you know, $40,000 a day.

2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:10.840
 So Albert's in New Jersey one day, broad daylight and, uh, stands at an ATM for 40 minutes,

2:01:10.840 --> 2:01:16.520
 just standing there, feeding in one ATM card after another, point out cash, taking the

2:01:16.520 --> 2:01:19.360
 20s out, stuff them in that backpack.

2:01:19.360 --> 2:01:24.080
 Meanwhile, just across the street, a couple of cops just happened to be there and they

2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:28.480
 start noticing this kid just standing there.

2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:31.880
 So 40 minutes, they watched this kid 40 minutes.

2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:33.760
 Only one cop looks at the other.

2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:36.520
 Let me see what's going on there.

2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:39.320
 Walks over across the street, Albert's wearing a wig.

2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:44.240
 He's got the disguise on everything else like that, asking kid, what are you doing?

2:01:44.240 --> 2:01:46.640
 Albert falls apart.

2:01:46.640 --> 2:01:48.880
 We didn't know Albert had been arrested.

2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:51.160
 So Albert immediately goes in.

2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:55.080
 I want to work with a secret service.

2:01:55.080 --> 2:02:01.640
 At that point in time, secret service, I referred to, and I don't, I want to make sure

2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:04.840
 that I don't say, it's not like that anymore.

2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:07.240
 But back then, they were fucking idiots.

2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:08.240
 All right.

2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:09.480
 They had no clue what was going on.

2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:12.640
 So there was a competence issue that they were working through, it's one way to put

2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:13.640
 it.

2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:15.240
 That's a nice, that's a nice euphemism.

2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:19.120
 Four fucking idiots is another way to say it.

2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:21.800
 So they're just like, not aware of the digital world.

2:02:21.800 --> 2:02:22.800
 They had no clue.

2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:23.800
 No clue.

2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:27.640
 The way that Albert tells them how to catch us, because they looked at them, how do we

2:02:27.640 --> 2:02:28.640
 catch them?

2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:31.160
 And Albert's like, Albert, I'm serious.

2:02:31.160 --> 2:02:37.600
 So Albert's like, well, you could try a VPN, what's a VPN?

2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:38.600
 So he explains it to them.

2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:41.920
 They're like, that's a good idea.

2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:43.880
 So I quit shadow crew.

2:02:43.880 --> 2:02:46.200
 I was worried about all the news that was coming in and everything like that.

2:02:46.200 --> 2:02:47.840
 I'm still in 160K a week.

2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:51.400
 I didn't know Albert had been arrested.

2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:52.520
 I'm worried about being arrested.

2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:56.280
 I know the, the writing's on the wall and I'm like, I'm quitting.

2:02:56.280 --> 2:02:58.480
 Where did you see the writing?

2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:03.000
 The IPs that were coming in, the text messages about the Secret Service Investigators.

2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:04.000
 Building your building.

2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:05.000
 So the pressure's building.

2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:06.000
 It's not gonna end well.

2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:07.000
 And this is not gonna end well.

2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:09.240
 This is, this is, this is going to be bad.

2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:18.160
 So I announced my retirement of February 15th, I'm sorry, April 15th, 2004 is my retirement.

2:03:18.160 --> 2:03:20.200
 I think that's the 2004.

2:03:20.200 --> 2:03:21.440
 And I quit.

2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:22.440
 I walk away.

2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:25.040
 Well, Albert had been arrested.

2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:26.240
 They cut him loose.

2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:27.320
 No one knows he's been arrested.

2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:29.040
 He comes back into shadow crew.

2:03:29.040 --> 2:03:31.840
 I leave Kim Taylor at the same time.

2:03:31.840 --> 2:03:35.440
 He's kind of on the run, which if you want to know that story, that's a nightmare story

2:03:35.440 --> 2:03:36.960
 in and of itself.

2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:42.720
 So my second in charge, Kim Taylor, this guy, there was this guy named David.

2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:46.320
 Oh, what was his name?

2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:49.120
 He was L. Mariachi was a guy's name.

2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:50.120
 David Thomas.

2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:51.120
 David.

2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:52.120
 Yeah.

2:03:52.120 --> 2:03:53.120
 Yeah.

2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:54.120
 He was a film guy.

2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:55.120
 Scarface.

2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:56.120
 Yeah.

2:03:56.120 --> 2:04:02.560
 And his real name, David Thomas, he's on the run out of Nebraska for check fraud.

2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:06.400
 He comes to us on shadow crew telling us this sad story.

2:04:06.400 --> 2:04:09.920
 We take up a collection for this guy, send it to him.

2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:10.920
 All right.

2:04:10.920 --> 2:04:14.920
 I get him a job working with a low level Carter trying to make him some money.

2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:15.920
 All right.

2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:21.040
 L. Mariachi, Thomas does this for a few weeks, comes to me one day and he's like, man, I'm

2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:22.040
 not making any money.

2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:23.480
 I'm like, okay, let me see what I can do.

2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:27.200
 So I had a Ukrainian guy by the name of big buyer.

2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:31.600
 He, a real friend of mine and I contact him, I was like, look, man, I got a guy that wants

2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:32.600
 to do some work.

2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:33.600
 Can you help the guy out?

2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:34.600
 And he's like, I got it.

2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:35.600
 I was like, okay.

2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:41.280
 So he sends Thomas enough money to go, Thomas is in Texas at that point, sends Thomas enough

2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:47.080
 money to go from Texas to Issaquah, Washington and rent an office space.

2:04:47.080 --> 2:04:48.600
 All right.

2:04:48.600 --> 2:04:52.840
 So Thomas goes up there, rents his office space, him and his girlfriend rents an office

2:04:52.840 --> 2:04:54.680
 space.

2:04:54.680 --> 2:05:01.720
 And the plan is this big buyer is going to place an order, get products sent.

2:05:01.720 --> 2:05:06.240
 Mariachi is going to get the product listed on eBay, cash out 50 50 easy enough.

2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:07.240
 All right.

2:05:07.240 --> 2:05:09.280
 So big buyer places an order.

2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:13.400
 First order is outpost.com $18,000.

2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:18.640
 The largest order outpost.com had ever received at that point in time.

2:05:18.640 --> 2:05:19.640
 Order goes through.

2:05:19.640 --> 2:05:20.640
 It goes through.

2:05:20.640 --> 2:05:21.640
 It goes through.

2:05:21.640 --> 2:05:23.840
 All right.

2:05:23.840 --> 2:05:27.740
 Mariachi comes back, tells me, tells my second in charge, Kim Taylor, Kim Taylor at this

2:05:27.740 --> 2:05:28.740
 point.

2:05:28.740 --> 2:05:32.560
 He's I'm 33 34 Kim Taylor's 46.

2:05:32.560 --> 2:05:36.480
 He works at the tattered cover bookstore in Denver, Colorado.

2:05:36.480 --> 2:05:37.800
 That's where he works at this point.

2:05:37.800 --> 2:05:39.200
 And he fancies himself.

2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:40.200
 Jason Bourne.

2:05:40.200 --> 2:05:41.200
 All right.

2:05:41.200 --> 2:05:43.760
 He's even got one of the screen names of Jason Bourne.

2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:44.760
 So I'm like, all right.

2:05:44.760 --> 2:05:48.280
 So Mariachi's telling us how much, how much money he's making everything else.

2:05:48.280 --> 2:05:49.280
 I'm like, well, that's good.

2:05:49.280 --> 2:05:50.280
 I'm glad you're all right.

2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:53.160
 Kim contacts me. He's like, I want to go to Issaquah.

2:05:53.320 --> 2:05:55.440
 And I was like, why? And he's like, to make some money.

2:05:55.440 --> 2:05:58.320
 I'm like, you're making money. He's like, I want to go to Issaquah.

2:05:58.560 --> 2:06:02.280
 I was like, all right, go be careful. So he gets in the car.

2:06:02.920 --> 2:06:04.440
 Saturn is what he's driving.

2:06:04.440 --> 2:06:08.000
 He drives his little piece of shit Saturn all the way up to Issaquah,

2:06:08.400 --> 2:06:10.600
 gets there, you know, midnight.

2:06:10.600 --> 2:06:13.840
 They party all night long because they've never met each other.

2:06:14.200 --> 2:06:17.160
 They're just celebrating, partying, drinking, everything else like that.

2:06:17.160 --> 2:06:21.640
 Meanwhile, Big Buyer has placed another order

2:06:22.840 --> 2:06:26.160
 with Outpost.com, $17,000.

2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:32.040
 The second largest order Outpost.com had ever received at that point in time.

2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:36.440
 By this point in time, Outpost knows the first order was fraudulent.

2:06:36.440 --> 2:06:37.480
 Guess where it's going?

2:06:37.600 --> 2:06:39.880
 The exact same address the first order goes.

2:06:40.600 --> 2:06:45.360
 So Outpost picks up the phone, calls Issaquah PD, hey, we got a fraudster.

2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:49.600
 Issaquah was like, would you mind sending some empty boxes?

2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:52.680
 Outpost is like, be happy to.

2:06:53.360 --> 2:06:58.960
 So the rule was, is on credit card fraud, if you've got full account access,

2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:00.600
 you place the order.

2:07:00.840 --> 2:07:05.080
 The morning it's supposed to arrive, you sign into the bank account or the credit card account.

2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:07.960
 If you can sign in, you go pick up your product.

2:07:07.960 --> 2:07:11.160
 If you can't sign in, you go back to sleep that day.

2:07:11.160 --> 2:07:12.160
 All right.

2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:14.960
 All right, well, Big Buyer was the guy who placed the order.

2:07:15.960 --> 2:07:18.560
 Mariachi and my second in charge are partying.

2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:19.040
 All right.

2:07:19.040 --> 2:07:20.840
 So they're supposed to contact Big Buyer.

2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:22.560
 They don't.

2:07:22.960 --> 2:07:29.560
 Meanwhile, Big Buyer is raising hell, getting up with me like, hey, where are the guys?

2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:30.800
 I can't find them.

2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:32.400
 They don't need to pick up this product.

2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:34.360
 So I can't get in touch with them.

2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:36.160
 They go down to pick up the thing.

2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:39.760
 So Mariachi's got a Cadillac, old 70s Cadillac.

2:07:39.960 --> 2:07:41.160
 He's got a Cadillac.

2:07:41.160 --> 2:07:44.160
 He's got a Cadillac pulls into the complex.

2:07:44.160 --> 2:07:46.160
 Now, Mariachi's driving.

2:07:47.160 --> 2:07:49.160
 Kim Taylor's in the passenger seat.

2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:52.160
 David Thomas's girlfriend's in the backseat.

2:07:53.160 --> 2:07:58.160
 As they pull into the complex, going through the parking lot, Mariachi just happens to glance over

2:07:58.160 --> 2:08:01.160
 and he sees a van with a guy sitting sideways in the van.

2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:05.160
 And he looks at Kim Taylor and he's like, that's an undercover.

2:08:05.160 --> 2:08:11.160
 And Kim's like, ah, it's fine.

2:08:11.160 --> 2:08:14.160
 So they pull up to the office complex.

2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:17.160
 Kim's like, I'll go in and get the packages.

2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:20.160
 So he walks in, looks at the guy behind the counter.

2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:22.160
 I believe you have some packages for us.

2:08:22.160 --> 2:08:24.160
 The guy's like, one second.

2:08:24.160 --> 2:08:30.160
 So he just appears around the wall, out pops the Issaquah PD, arrest Kim.

2:08:30.160 --> 2:08:33.160
 David Thomas is in the car watching all this happen.

2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:40.160
 Bugs out and they arrest him on the interstate where he has three fake driver's licenses in his wallet

2:08:40.160 --> 2:08:42.160
 along with his real driver's license.

2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:44.160
 Another no, no, but they get him.

2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:48.160
 So David Thomas had outstanding warrants out of Nebraska.

2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:50.160
 We couldn't bond him out.

2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:52.160
 Kim Taylor didn't have any warrants.

2:08:52.160 --> 2:08:54.160
 So we bonded him out.

2:08:54.160 --> 2:08:59.160
 My third in charge kid, Seth Sanders was his name.

2:08:59.160 --> 2:09:03.160
 He bonds him out, uses his girlfriend's account to bond him out.

2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:14.160
 And I get Kim Taylor to go to Utah where another friend of mine agrees to housing him and his wife.

2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:17.160
 So I think everything's fine and all that.

2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:22.160
 About three weeks later, this guy in Utah gets me on the phone.

2:09:22.160 --> 2:09:24.160
 Hey, he's got to go.

2:09:24.160 --> 2:09:27.160
 I'm like, what's going on?

2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:33.160
 He's like, well, the only thing he's doing is popping ecstasy tablets every day, all day.

2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:35.160
 And I'm like, seriously?

2:09:35.160 --> 2:09:37.160
 He's like, yeah, I was like, okay, he's got to go.

2:09:37.160 --> 2:09:38.160
 So we kick him out of there.

2:09:38.160 --> 2:09:40.160
 By this point, I've got another crew that's coming through.

2:09:40.160 --> 2:09:44.160
 I mean, I had all these crews running had another crew that's coming through Denver,

2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:49.160
 send Kim back to Denver to partner up with these guys.

2:09:49.160 --> 2:09:51.160
 Kim gets these guys arrested.

2:09:51.160 --> 2:09:54.160
 So by this point in time, I'm exasperated.

2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:57.160
 I just want to throw my hands up in the air and walk away.

2:09:57.160 --> 2:10:00.160
 So my retirement's coming up at the same time.

2:10:00.160 --> 2:10:02.160
 So I'm like, fuck it.

2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:03.160
 I'm done.

2:10:03.160 --> 2:10:07.160
 So I tell everybody at the rest of the admins and the mods there, I'm like, this is what's going on.

2:10:07.160 --> 2:10:09.160
 You guys need to watch out for this.

2:10:09.160 --> 2:10:11.160
 We need to ban Kim, not let him back in.

2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:13.160
 Be careful what's going on.

2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:17.160
 I walk away at the same time I walk away.

2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:18.160
 Come to Johnny.

2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:20.160
 Albert Gonzalez comes back into play.

2:10:20.160 --> 2:10:22.160
 He sees everything that's going on.

2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:23.160
 He uses that to his advantage.

2:10:23.160 --> 2:10:34.160
 He starts banning everyone that's suspicious of him, sets up the VPN at the same time and says, hey, to make sure we're all secure, I need all transactions to go through this VPN.

2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:37.160
 VPNs ran by the Secret Service.

2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:38.160
 All right.

2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:44.160
 Secret Service ends up, I think they ended up cataloging like $7 million worth of transactions over the next four or five months.

2:10:44.160 --> 2:10:49.160
 Shadow Crew makes the front cover of Forbes, August 2004.

2:10:49.160 --> 2:10:52.160
 Headline, who's stealing your identity?

2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:54.160
 October 26, 2004.

2:10:54.160 --> 2:11:00.160
 United States Secret Service, arrest 33 people, six countries, six hours.

2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:08.160
 I was in Charleston, South Carolina when I saw it happen and I'm like, you're the one that got away.

2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:09.160
 I'm the one public.

2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:12.160
 There were a couple of other guys that got away that they didn't publicly mention.

2:11:12.160 --> 2:11:14.160
 One, his name was Tron.

2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:16.160
 He was in the zero.

2:11:16.160 --> 2:11:18.160
 Yeah, exactly.

2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:27.160
 But he went by the screen named Tron, he had access, almost unfettered access to Bank of America.

2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:32.160
 So what happens is they identified the guy, Secret Service is in the air to go get him.

2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:33.160
 They call the Ukrainian police.

2:11:33.160 --> 2:11:35.160
 Hey, we're coming down to arrest this guy.

2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:38.160
 Ukrainian cops are like, oh, come on down.

2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:45.160
 So as soon as they got off the phone, Ukrainian cops get in the car, go down and tell Tron, hey, they're coming to get you.

2:11:45.160 --> 2:11:51.160
 So he bugs out down to South America and they don't catch him, I think for six or seven years after that.

2:11:51.160 --> 2:11:52.160
 But caught him eventually.

2:11:52.160 --> 2:11:53.160
 Caught him eventually.

2:11:53.160 --> 2:11:55.160
 Well, let me actually ask you on this point.

2:11:55.160 --> 2:12:00.160
 You said that if you do cyber crime eventually, it's not going to end well.

2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:01.160
 It does not end well.

2:12:01.160 --> 2:12:03.160
 Why is that?

2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:09.160
 So I don't want to say that's because you're going to be arrested because honestly, very few people are arrested.

2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:15.160
 All right, but it doesn't end well because of the type of person that you become.

2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:17.160
 You quoted me earlier.

2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:21.160
 You lie to everybody around you.

2:12:21.160 --> 2:12:22.160
 You lie to yourself.

2:12:22.160 --> 2:12:23.160
 You lie to your friends.

2:12:23.160 --> 2:12:24.160
 You lie to your family.

2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:25.160
 Of course, you lie to your victims.

2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:27.160
 You don't have any friends.

2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:30.160
 You know, I went 20 years without friends.

2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:31.160
 I had associates.

2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:33.160
 I didn't have friends.

2:12:33.160 --> 2:12:35.160
 And you can't truly trust anybody.

2:12:35.160 --> 2:12:36.160
 You don't trust anybody.

2:12:36.160 --> 2:12:37.160
 You don't trust anybody.

2:12:37.160 --> 2:12:42.160
 You know, I had my wife, I was married for nine years.

2:12:42.160 --> 2:12:45.160
 I lied to her every single day of those nine years.

2:12:45.160 --> 2:12:52.160
 And it took her nine years to give up on me to realize that I was that piece of shit.

2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:55.160
 And she leaves at that point.

2:12:55.160 --> 2:12:59.160
 Then from there, I started dating a stripper and lied to her.

2:12:59.160 --> 2:13:00.160
 I thought I had friends.

2:13:00.160 --> 2:13:04.160
 I lied to all those people that I knew that thought they were my friends.

2:13:04.160 --> 2:13:07.160
 I lied to them the entire time.

2:13:07.160 --> 2:13:09.160
 You become that individual.

2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:14.160
 I don't think a lot of people really understand how bad that is.

2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:18.160
 You know, you talked about, you pointed out that woman that I ripped off.

2:13:18.160 --> 2:13:22.160
 She was trying to put a roof on her house for freaking kids, man.

2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:23.160
 You're that person.

2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:25.160
 You're that person.

2:13:25.160 --> 2:13:37.160
 You're also lying to yourself and that's not a mindset in which you can grow as a person,

2:13:37.160 --> 2:13:42.160
 find happiness, find genuine, simple human affection, which is what love is.

2:13:42.160 --> 2:13:43.160
 Yeah.

2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:46.160
 Simple, real friendship, all of those things.

2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:47.160
 Right.

2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:48.160
 So, you know, I went to prison, of course.

2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:51.160
 One of the things that, one of the most important lessons that I have, that I've learned in

2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:56.160
 prison because cyber crime, crime as a whole, if you're a criminal, it's an addiction.

2:13:56.160 --> 2:13:57.160
 All right.

2:13:57.160 --> 2:14:00.160
 If you're addicted to something, whether it be drugs, crime, gambling, what have you,

2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:05.160
 if you're addicted to something, you cannot love anything else except the addiction.

2:14:05.160 --> 2:14:07.160
 The addiction comes first.

2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:08.160
 All right.

2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:13.160
 And, you know, you pointed out some of those truly despicable things.

2:14:13.160 --> 2:14:16.160
 Script, for example, tortures that guy.

2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:20.160
 You get to the point where it's like, okay, this is the business.

2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:25.160
 And, you know, I tried to convince myself that, you know, I'm a businessman, but I'm

2:14:25.160 --> 2:14:27.160
 a good guy on the other end.

2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:28.160
 And you're not.

2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:29.160
 You're not.

2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:32.160
 So, those lies become part of it, everything else.

2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:37.160
 And, you know, it's, yeah, you get the higher ups are usually arrested.

2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:38.160
 They are.

2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:40.160
 But, you know, you've got millions of cyber criminals these days.

2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:43.160
 So, most guys are not going to be arrested.

2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:45.160
 So, you may be arrested.

2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:50.160
 You may, you may be like freaking Jonathan James.

2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:54.160
 He was a minor, a very, very talented individual, very competent.

2:14:54.160 --> 2:14:58.160
 He had, as a kid, he had broken into NASA, DOD, Pentagon.

2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:01.160
 He shut the NASA computers down for six weeks.

2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:03.160
 This is that kid.

2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:07.160
 Then he decides he wants to go into credit card theft, partners with Albert.

2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:09.160
 He's arrested with Albert.

2:15:09.160 --> 2:15:13.160
 Law enforcement, they were going to blame him.

2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:15.160
 He was the only competent individual.

2:15:15.160 --> 2:15:17.160
 So, this kid gets up one day.

2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:19.160
 He wasn't in prison yet.

2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:24.160
 He gets up one day, goes in his dad's bedroom, gets out his 45, walks in the bathroom

2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:26.160
 and blows his brains out.

2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:29.160
 You know, you've got, you've got things like that.

2:15:29.160 --> 2:15:32.160
 Or you're going to rip somebody off and you're going to end up like scripted

2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:37.160
 with that guy, the guy who hit, who ran Evolution Marketplace.

2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:40.160
 No wonder who, two people ran that guy and a girl.

2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:42.160
 No wonder who they were.

2:15:42.160 --> 2:15:46.160
 He ends up stealing about $24 million, a lot of from Ukrainian mob.

2:15:46.160 --> 2:15:50.160
 And they found him about a year later on a beach without his head and hands.

2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:53.160
 But, you know, it always goes south.

2:15:53.160 --> 2:15:58.160
 But more than anything to me, the, the negative thing is, is you really become

2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:05.160
 somebody that, I mean, just truly a despicable human being.

2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:11.160
 When you get to the point when you're, you're destroying people's retirement accounts,

2:16:11.160 --> 2:16:17.160
 you're stealing money from a woman that simply wants to do something good for her family.

2:16:17.160 --> 2:16:22.160
 When you, when you become that individual and you're okay with that, my God, man.

2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:25.160
 It got to the point, I had one guy I ripped off.

2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:27.160
 It's like for $900.

2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:31.160
 And when I first started the cyber crime stuff, it's when I was becoming competent.

2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:35.160
 And I ripped him off for like $900.

2:16:35.160 --> 2:16:40.160
 And he sent me an email and he was like,

2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:47.160
 the email said something like, I guess you needed the money and it's okay.

2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:52.160
 You know, you keep it and how I'm getting chills right now thinking about it.

2:16:52.160 --> 2:16:59.160
 It's that, where you become that individual.

2:16:59.160 --> 2:17:01.160
 Yeah.

2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:03.160
 Can I actually backtrack?

2:17:03.160 --> 2:17:05.160
 Listen, I love love.

2:17:05.160 --> 2:17:06.160
 Okay.

2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:07.160
 I do.

2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:11.160
 And there's a story that you fell in love with the stripper.

2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:13.160
 I mean, you have to tell the story.

2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:17.160
 So how did you fall in love with somebody?

2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:21.160
 Not there's anything wrong with that profession, but it's, it's, it's romantic.

2:17:21.160 --> 2:17:23.160
 It's like that true romance, by the way, great movie.

2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:25.160
 It is a great film.

2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:27.160
 It's truly a great film.

2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:31.160
 Even Brad Pitt, who makes a brief appearance is genius.

2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:33.160
 There's so much good acting there.

2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:36.160
 Anyway, so tell me that love story.

2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:41.160
 So, you know, that, like I said, I get from my dad, I get that fear of being abandoned.

2:17:41.160 --> 2:17:47.160
 You know, I lied to my wife for nine years until she leaves and I was in Charleston,

2:17:47.160 --> 2:17:48.160
 South Carolina.

2:17:48.160 --> 2:17:55.160
 And what happened was I noticed that Susan, she was not coming to bed like, you know,

2:17:55.160 --> 2:18:01.160
 she used to and she'd stay up all night long and sometimes she'd go and be gone a few hours

2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:02.160
 and everything else.

2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:03.160
 And I'm like, well, something's going on.

2:18:03.160 --> 2:18:07.160
 And I'd passed by her, her computer and she would minimize the screens and I'm like,

2:18:07.160 --> 2:18:10.160
 well, got to figure out what the hell is going on.

2:18:10.160 --> 2:18:17.160
 So put a key logger on her system as any, anybody should in a relationship.

2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:18.160
 Absolutely.

2:18:18.160 --> 2:18:19.160
 Cause you trust him.

2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:20.160
 Yeah.

2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:21.160
 Why not?

2:18:21.160 --> 2:18:23.160
 You should be tracking all their movements, all their.

2:18:23.160 --> 2:18:24.160
 Exactly.

2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:25.160
 Exactly.

2:18:25.160 --> 2:18:26.160
 Like I said, I was the control freak too.

2:18:26.160 --> 2:18:27.160
 It's romantic.

2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:30.160
 So I found out she had been cheating on me and she was.

2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:31.160
 Steve, here you go.

2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:32.160
 They had a reason.

2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:33.160
 I justified.

2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:35.160
 So I found out she was cheating on me.

2:18:35.160 --> 2:18:36.160
 She was asleep when I found it out.

2:18:36.160 --> 2:18:39.160
 And I sat there looking at it and I was like, well, shit.

2:18:39.160 --> 2:18:45.160
 So got up, walked in the bedroom, opened up the wardrobe, got a suitcase out, started

2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:47.160
 putting her clothes in it and she wakes up.

2:18:47.160 --> 2:18:48.160
 She's like, where are you going?

2:18:48.160 --> 2:18:51.160
 I'm like, I'm not, you are.

2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:55.160
 Well, my, my vibrato disappeared pretty quickly.

2:18:55.160 --> 2:19:01.160
 I took about a week of both of us crying and arguing and everything else.

2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:06.160
 And she, she finally left and I went through this depression.

2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:09.160
 I went, I was in Charleston, South Carolina.

2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:14.160
 I would just walk around the house kind of stumbling in a daze, realized I was getting

2:19:14.160 --> 2:19:20.160
 suicidal and was smart enough to do something about it and picked up the phone book.

2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:22.160
 And that's where there's always this sense of humor.

2:19:22.160 --> 2:19:23.160
 So I picked up a phone book.

2:19:23.160 --> 2:19:24.160
 I'm going through the yellow pages.

2:19:24.160 --> 2:19:27.160
 I'm like psychologist, criminal psychologist.

2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:30.160
 Cause I need that.

2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:32.160
 Called this psychologist crying to her.

2:19:32.160 --> 2:19:34.160
 I'm crying on the phone, told her everything.

2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:35.160
 I'm this criminal.

2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:36.160
 This is what's happened.

2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:37.160
 She's like, come in now.

2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:43.160
 So I go in, spill my guts and saw her for about four months and I joke about it.

2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:44.160
 It's true.

2:19:44.160 --> 2:19:49.160
 She, she was trying to get me to stop breaking the law and to go into real estate.

2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:52.160
 And I remember telling her, is there a difference?

2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:54.160
 She was like, yes, there's a difference.

2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:56.160
 So saw her for about four months.

2:19:56.160 --> 2:19:59.160
 I was, I was 34.

2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:02.160
 I didn't start drinking until I was 34.

2:20:02.160 --> 2:20:07.160
 I'd never done drugs or anything else like that because my mom was an addict as well.

2:20:07.160 --> 2:20:08.160
 So I was this guy.

2:20:08.160 --> 2:20:10.160
 I always wanted to be in control.

2:20:10.160 --> 2:20:16.160
 Didn't want to, you know, lose control of myself and had never been to strip club.

2:20:16.160 --> 2:20:19.160
 So one night I was getting lonely.

2:20:19.160 --> 2:20:21.160
 So I walked into the strip club.

2:20:21.160 --> 2:20:26.160
 Actually I was researched as strip club and it was Joe's roundup in Charleston, South

2:20:26.160 --> 2:20:27.160
 Carolina.

2:20:27.160 --> 2:20:28.160
 Joe's roundup.

2:20:28.160 --> 2:20:30.160
 Little bitty hole in the wall stuff.

2:20:30.160 --> 2:20:32.160
 I was, yeah, real classy.

2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:39.160
 So I walked in and I'm literally that guy, man, that fell in love with the first, the

2:20:39.160 --> 2:20:41.160
 first stripper that he sees.

2:20:41.160 --> 2:20:42.160
 She walks by.

2:20:42.160 --> 2:20:44.160
 I'm like that one.

2:20:44.160 --> 2:20:46.160
 So I didn't know, I didn't know the strip club game.

2:20:46.160 --> 2:20:48.160
 Again, criminal, naive as hell.

2:20:48.160 --> 2:20:52.160
 So I'm belly up at the bar, order the beer.

2:20:52.160 --> 2:20:54.160
 I'm sitting there drinking it.

2:20:54.160 --> 2:21:00.160
 She comes over to me and we start talking and she's like, would you like to get a bottle

2:21:00.160 --> 2:21:01.160
 of champagne?

2:21:01.160 --> 2:21:03.160
 I was like, does that mean going in back or what?

2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:05.160
 And she's like, well, yeah, you need to do the bottle to come back.

2:21:05.160 --> 2:21:08.160
 And I was like, sure, let's buy a bottle of champagne.

2:21:08.160 --> 2:21:10.160
 $400 bottle of Corbel.

2:21:10.160 --> 2:21:13.160
 So I'm like, all right.

2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:15.160
 So that again, that bravado disappears pretty quickly.

2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:18.160
 I get back there and we talk for two hours.

2:21:18.160 --> 2:21:23.160
 And, you know, nowadays I understand that most men who go to strip clubs, the strippers

2:21:23.160 --> 2:21:25.160
 are their therapist most of the time.

2:21:25.160 --> 2:21:26.160
 All right.

2:21:26.160 --> 2:21:27.160
 So I'm sitting there talking.

2:21:27.160 --> 2:21:28.160
 We're talking.

2:21:28.160 --> 2:21:29.160
 And of course she's sizing me up.

2:21:29.160 --> 2:21:30.160
 She's looking at the watch.

2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:32.160
 She's like, what kind of car you drive?

2:21:32.160 --> 2:21:34.160
 You know, everything else.

2:21:34.160 --> 2:21:36.160
 And I'm like telling her I'm talking.

2:21:36.160 --> 2:21:39.160
 And so at the end of the night, I'm like, really nice to meet you.

2:21:39.160 --> 2:21:41.160
 She's like, it's so nice meeting you too.

2:21:41.160 --> 2:21:43.160
 So I leave.

2:21:43.160 --> 2:21:45.160
 You guys just talked.

2:21:45.160 --> 2:21:46.160
 Just talked.

2:21:46.160 --> 2:21:48.160
 And there's no dance feeling of love and all that.

2:21:48.160 --> 2:21:49.160
 Yeah.

2:21:49.160 --> 2:21:50.160
 So just talk.

2:21:50.160 --> 2:21:51.160
 Just, you know, got along pretty good.

2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:52.160
 I'm like, I like her.

2:21:52.160 --> 2:21:54.160
 I like her.

2:21:54.160 --> 2:21:59.160
 So come back in a week later, walk in and call her over.

2:21:59.160 --> 2:22:03.160
 And I was like, look, I said, I'm not, I said, that was my first time to strip club.

2:22:03.160 --> 2:22:04.160
 I said, don't know you.

2:22:04.160 --> 2:22:05.160
 I like you.

2:22:05.160 --> 2:22:06.160
 I'd like to know you more.

2:22:06.160 --> 2:22:07.160
 Would you like to go out to dinner?

2:22:07.160 --> 2:22:09.160
 And she was like, yeah.

2:22:09.160 --> 2:22:12.160
 I was like, where would you like to go?

2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:13.160
 So she says, rude to John.

2:22:13.160 --> 2:22:15.160
 And I was like, don't know what it is.

2:22:15.160 --> 2:22:16.160
 That's where we'll go.

2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:20.160
 So I go back and I was, I had a theater buddy at that point in time because I was trying

2:22:20.160 --> 2:22:23.160
 to get my life, yeah, trying to get my life together.

2:22:23.160 --> 2:22:24.160
 JC was his name.

2:22:24.160 --> 2:22:25.160
 And I was like, I got a date.

2:22:25.160 --> 2:22:26.160
 And he's like, he got a date.

2:22:26.160 --> 2:22:28.160
 I was like, yeah, man, I got a date.

2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:30.160
 And he's like, okay, where are you going?

2:22:30.160 --> 2:22:31.160
 I was like, rude to John.

2:22:31.160 --> 2:22:34.160
 And he's like, take your wallet.

2:22:34.160 --> 2:22:35.160
 I'm like, yeah.

2:22:35.160 --> 2:22:37.160
 And he's like, take your wallet.

2:22:37.160 --> 2:22:39.160
 It's like, all right.

2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:44.160
 So we start, you know, doing the lunch and the dinner thing.

2:22:44.160 --> 2:22:47.160
 And I get to where I really like her.

2:22:47.160 --> 2:22:52.160
 I was 34, she was 23 and got along really well.

2:22:52.160 --> 2:22:56.160
 Listen, you know, had common interest in music and arts and stuff like that.

2:22:56.160 --> 2:22:58.160
 She had, I mean, it's stereotypical.

2:22:58.160 --> 2:23:04.160
 She was, she had graduated college with a degree in religious studies.

2:23:04.160 --> 2:23:05.160
 Yeah.

2:23:05.160 --> 2:23:07.160
 So I was like, all right.

2:23:07.160 --> 2:23:08.160
 So.

2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:10.160
 So yeah, you just fell in love.

2:23:10.160 --> 2:23:11.160
 Yeah.

2:23:11.160 --> 2:23:12.160
 We got along really well, really well.

2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:14.160
 So I ended up moving her in with me.

2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:23.160
 She hadn't quit her job and what was happening was she was working weekends and, you know,

2:23:23.160 --> 2:23:25.160
 the club would close at three or four.

2:23:25.160 --> 2:23:30.160
 She wouldn't come home until 10 or 11 in the morning.

2:23:30.160 --> 2:23:34.160
 And most of the time it would be a phone call saying, come and pick me up.

2:23:34.160 --> 2:23:35.160
 I can't drive home.

2:23:35.160 --> 2:23:39.160
 And then I'd never used drugs, had never been around.

2:23:39.160 --> 2:23:42.160
 My mom, Valium and pot and things like that.

2:23:42.160 --> 2:23:46.160
 But as far as interacting with her, I'd never done anything like that.

2:23:46.160 --> 2:23:49.160
 By this point of time, I'm kind of getting head over heels with her.

2:23:49.160 --> 2:23:51.160
 I've moved her in with me and everything.

2:23:51.160 --> 2:23:54.160
 And I had never, I was 34.

2:23:54.160 --> 2:23:57.160
 I'd never went through a woman's purse in my entire life.

2:23:57.160 --> 2:24:01.160
 And so she comes in, passes out.

2:24:01.160 --> 2:24:04.160
 And I'm like, I gotta know what the fuck's going on.

2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:11.160
 And went over and went through a purse, found cocaine and, you know,

2:24:11.160 --> 2:24:13.160
 straw cut off straws and all that stuff.

2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:15.160
 And I'm like, broke my heart.

2:24:15.160 --> 2:24:22.160
 I just sat there and started crying, got online and I'm the guy that can

2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:23.160
 find the information.

2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:29.160
 So I started looking for forums on strip clubs, found a forum, found that one,

2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:35.160
 found where it was talking about her, prostitute yourself to support the habit.

2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:40.160
 And that got me, man.

2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:41.160
 That got me.

2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:45.160
 It's talking about everything she was doing to do that.

2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:47.160
 And that broke your heart there.

2:24:47.160 --> 2:24:48.160
 Oh, man.

2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:49.160
 Yeah.

2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:55.160
 So I went and I didn't have the heart to tell her that I knew she was prostituting.

2:24:55.160 --> 2:24:58.160
 But I went to her and I was like, she was waking up and I was like, look,

2:24:58.160 --> 2:25:00.160
 I found this in your purse.

2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:02.160
 I can't have that.

2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:04.160
 And she's like, well, you think I'm prostituting?

2:25:04.160 --> 2:25:06.160
 And I was like, no, no, I don't think that.

2:25:06.160 --> 2:25:08.160
 I knew it, but I didn't mention it to her.

2:25:08.160 --> 2:25:12.160
 And I was like, I can't have that.

2:25:12.160 --> 2:25:13.160
 Well, I don't do that.

2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:14.160
 It's just a one time thing.

2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:15.160
 I was like, all right.

2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:20.160
 So she went back to work and continued to do it for a couple more weeks.

2:25:20.160 --> 2:25:23.160
 And then finally I was like, I can't.

2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:28.160
 So I picked her up one morning as like she was, she was, she couldn't drive home.

2:25:28.160 --> 2:25:32.160
 Before I picked her up, I'd written her a note, left it on the pillow.

2:25:32.160 --> 2:25:35.160
 So I brought her home, tucked her in the bed.

2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:41.160
 And told her I'd be back that night.

2:25:41.160 --> 2:25:43.160
 Told her she had a letter when she woke up.

2:25:43.160 --> 2:25:46.160
 I woke up and the letter was basically, you know, I love you.

2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:50.160
 If you can't stop this, don't be here when I get back.

2:25:50.160 --> 2:26:04.160
 And I went to Columbia that day, came back that night and she had quit her job.

2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:11.160
 And she quit drugs that night.

2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:13.160
 Really quit.

2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:29.160
 And I got it in my head that I needed to do whatever I needed to do to make sure she didn't go back to that.

2:26:29.160 --> 2:26:37.160
 That became, to me, because of my background, that meant spending a lot of money.

2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:42.160
 And so every night was, you know, three to $600 for dinner.

2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:49.160
 It was $1,000 shoes every week, $2,000 purse every week, all that.

2:26:49.160 --> 2:26:54.160
 I had most of my money laundered out to Estonia.

2:26:54.160 --> 2:27:02.160
 And Elizabeth, at the same time, she had, she quit.

2:27:02.160 --> 2:27:09.160
 But she didn't want me to go anywhere.

2:27:09.160 --> 2:27:12.160
 All right, she wanted me there all the time.

2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:14.160
 I guess that was that connection.

2:27:14.160 --> 2:27:17.160
 You know, I guess she was scared she might go back to something.

2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:24.160
 So Shadow Crew gets busted.

2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:26.160
 I go through basically all my U.S. funds, can't get anything from overseas.

2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:28.160
 Shadow Crew gets busted October.

2:27:28.160 --> 2:27:32.160
 I can't go into committing tax fraud because season's over.

2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:35.160
 Can't go back into credit fraud because Shadow Crew's been busted.

2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:37.160
 I don't know who to trust online.

2:27:37.160 --> 2:27:46.160
 I'm left with running counterfeit cashier's checks to get money in, trying to make it until, you know, I can start back with some other fraud.

2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:49.160
 And lying to her the entire time.

2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:51.160
 She knows about none of this.

2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:53.160
 None of it.

2:27:53.160 --> 2:27:56.160
 And she thinks I've got a shitload of money.

2:27:56.160 --> 2:27:59.160
 And she's got expensive tastes.

2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:06.160
 So, and at the same time, she couldn't be intimate.

2:28:06.160 --> 2:28:08.160
 I mean, the girl loved me.

2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:12.160
 That's the first time I've really said that.

2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:15.160
 So there's deep love there both ways.

2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:17.160
 Yeah.

2:28:17.160 --> 2:28:19.160
 Yeah.

2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:21.160
 The things we do.

2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:30.160
 So, uh, she couldn't be intimate unless she was stone cold drunk.

2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:34.160
 I mean, just shit, stones go drunk.

2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:38.160
 And I, you know, I said, I didn't mind her drinking alcohol.

2:28:38.160 --> 2:28:41.160
 I'd rather have that than cocaine.

2:28:41.160 --> 2:28:45.160
 So, uh, that was the intimacy there.

2:28:45.160 --> 2:28:57.160
 And I kept, I had this, I kept thinking if I continued to invest, that it would work out, you know, that just keep going.

2:28:57.160 --> 2:28:59.160
 She'll be all right.

2:28:59.160 --> 2:29:03.160
 We'll be all right.

2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:07.160
 And what happens is, is like I said, she thought I had money.

2:29:07.160 --> 2:29:09.160
 She thought I had money.

2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:11.160
 She wanted a couple of Tiffany engagement rings.

2:29:11.160 --> 2:29:13.160
 So I said, we can get married.

2:29:13.160 --> 2:29:16.160
 You know, I figured a marriage sure that I love her.

2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:18.160
 Sure, it's going to be all right.

2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:21.160
 So I was like, let's get married.

2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:23.160
 She's like, well, I've always wanted a Tiffany ring.

2:29:23.160 --> 2:29:26.160
 She doesn't have money by the Tiffany ring cause all my money was overseas.

2:29:26.160 --> 2:29:27.160
 So here I am.

2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:30.160
 I defraud since counterfeit cashiers.

2:29:30.160 --> 2:29:38.160
 I find a, like a three carat ring on eBay for 20 grand and pay for it with a counterfeit cashier.

2:29:38.160 --> 2:29:42.160
 Check at the same time, because she doesn't want me to leave.

2:29:42.160 --> 2:29:44.160
 She needs me there.

2:29:44.160 --> 2:29:48.160
 Typically if you're doing that type of crime, you need to be traveling.

2:29:48.160 --> 2:29:52.160
 You can't do it in one central area because you're going to be identified pretty quickly.

2:29:52.160 --> 2:29:56.160
 I knew that, but I didn't have much choice.

2:29:56.160 --> 2:30:05.160
 So start running counterfeit cashiers checks to get the money to, to live and everything and get the, get the engagement ring.

2:30:05.160 --> 2:30:12.160
 We were scheduled to be married.

2:30:12.160 --> 2:30:21.160
 Our wedding date was February 26th, 2005, February 8th, 2005.

2:30:21.160 --> 2:30:31.160
 I'm, I've got a Tiffany wedding band couple of them coming in and I get arrested in Charleston, South Carolina.

2:30:31.160 --> 2:30:36.160
 And she didn't know, I told her, I said, I've got to go pick up those rings.

2:30:36.160 --> 2:30:39.160
 She didn't, she thought I was just having them sent in.

2:30:39.160 --> 2:30:40.160
 So I had to get those rings.

2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:42.160
 I said, we'll go out to dinner after that.

2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:54.160
 And I left at like eight o clock in the morning and I was arrested at I think 1130, something like that.

2:30:54.160 --> 2:31:00.160
 Of course I wanted to call her, you know, and the FBI got me, it turns out it was, it was controlled delivery.

2:31:00.160 --> 2:31:03.160
 There were like 30 agents in the parking line.

2:31:03.160 --> 2:31:06.160
 FBI got me and Charleston PD got me within 45 minutes.

2:31:06.160 --> 2:31:09.160
 The secret service comes in, takes over that investigation.

2:31:09.160 --> 2:31:16.160
 They knew exactly who they had long about seven o clock at night.

2:31:16.160 --> 2:31:18.160
 They're like, we want to search your house.

2:31:18.160 --> 2:31:23.160
 And I was like, look, I'll sign off on the search if you let me go with you so I can see her.

2:31:23.160 --> 2:31:34.160
 And they were like, okay, so I got to see my phone at that point had like 140 calls that she, where she had been trying to call that time.

2:31:34.160 --> 2:31:35.160
 She was worried.

2:31:35.160 --> 2:31:36.160
 Yeah.

2:31:36.160 --> 2:31:40.160
 And so they load me up in hell.

2:31:40.160 --> 2:31:46.160
 I mean, you talk about 1012 cars, you know, 40 agents, everything else.

2:31:46.160 --> 2:31:47.160
 She's got a dog at that point.

2:31:47.160 --> 2:31:58.160
 I'm scared they're going to shoot the dog and it was dark and they had me walk up and they're all behind me.

2:31:58.160 --> 2:32:03.160
 I knock on the door and tell her the police are there and she needs to put the dog up.

2:32:03.160 --> 2:32:11.160
 So she does and they come in and just start ransacking them to put me in cuffs, set me down, start berating her with questions.

2:32:11.160 --> 2:32:13.160
 She had no idea what the hell was going on.

2:32:13.160 --> 2:32:16.160
 Were you able to say a word or two to help her understand?

2:32:16.160 --> 2:32:21.160
 Yeah, I was trying to tell her and at the same time, they're, they take a watch off her wrist.

2:32:21.160 --> 2:32:22.160
 They let her keep the ring.

2:32:22.160 --> 2:32:25.160
 They're telling her that I'm this guy.

2:32:25.160 --> 2:32:26.160
 What's my real name?

2:32:26.160 --> 2:32:29.160
 Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang across across the board.

2:32:29.160 --> 2:32:30.160
 So she's probably terrified.

2:32:30.160 --> 2:32:31.160
 Oh yeah.

2:32:31.160 --> 2:32:32.160
 Yeah.

2:32:32.160 --> 2:32:33.160
 Yeah.

2:32:33.160 --> 2:32:36.160
 And I tell her, I was like, look, they're going to rain me tomorrow.

2:32:36.160 --> 2:32:37.160
 Don't come.

2:32:37.160 --> 2:32:38.160
 Don't come.

2:32:38.160 --> 2:32:42.160
 I said, uh, see what's going on, but don't show up.

2:32:42.160 --> 2:32:43.160
 Of course she's there next morning.

2:32:43.160 --> 2:32:47.160
 Her, her dad and she's, she's back in the back crying.

2:32:47.160 --> 2:32:49.160
 They're reading off the charges.

2:32:49.160 --> 2:32:53.160
 I'm under $300,000 bond.

2:32:53.160 --> 2:32:55.160
 Everything else.

2:32:55.160 --> 2:32:57.160
 And that's it.

2:32:57.160 --> 2:33:00.160
 I, they throw me in a cell.

2:33:00.160 --> 2:33:09.160
 Meanwhile, more charges keep coming in, you know, and it's like 10, 12 charges a day at that point.

2:33:09.160 --> 2:33:16.160
 And I'm trying to call her to make sure she's all right and does get through.

2:33:16.160 --> 2:33:18.160
 So I spent three months in jail.

2:33:18.160 --> 2:33:21.160
 And during that three months, she visits twice.

2:33:21.160 --> 2:33:23.160
 I get like three or four phone calls to her.

2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:26.160
 Um, I was looking back.

2:33:26.160 --> 2:33:29.160
 Now I understand why, you know, back then it was like, I'm the victim.

2:33:29.160 --> 2:33:31.160
 You know, why doesn't she talk to me?

2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:36.160
 But, uh, you know, now I understand why the hell the girl let me too.

2:33:36.160 --> 2:33:38.160
 You know, she found out I was this piece of shit.

2:33:38.160 --> 2:33:48.160
 And, uh, after a week in county jail, two agents fly in from New Jersey, two secret service guys pulled me out of cell.

2:33:48.160 --> 2:33:51.160
 Looked at me and they were like, we've got your laptop.

2:33:51.160 --> 2:33:52.160
 And I was like, yeah.

2:33:52.160 --> 2:33:57.160
 And he's like, well, if you got anything on your laptop, I was like, yeah, he's like, you're going to be charged for it.

2:33:57.160 --> 2:33:58.160
 I was like, I figured.

2:33:58.160 --> 2:34:03.160
 And then he looks at me and is like, can you do anything for us?

2:34:03.160 --> 2:34:08.160
 And I told him my exact words were, look, you let me get back with Elizabeth.

2:34:08.160 --> 2:34:10.160
 I'll do whatever you want me to do.

2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:11.160
 And he looks at me.

2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:13.160
 He's like, we're going to get you out.

2:34:13.160 --> 2:34:14.160
 I was like, all right.

2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:21.160
 So they let me sit there for three months to get a taste of it and, uh, get me out.

2:34:21.160 --> 2:34:24.160
 My sister, they have the bond reduced to a thousand dollars.

2:34:24.160 --> 2:34:27.160
 My sister pays the thousand dollar bond by this point.

2:34:27.160 --> 2:34:32.160
 She's just on me and because I'm dating the stripper and, uh,

2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:35.160
 Denise bonds me out.

2:34:35.160 --> 2:34:39.160
 The person that I call immediately is Elizabeth.

2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:42.160
 I'm out and she's like, I'll be there.

2:34:42.160 --> 2:34:43.160
 Okay.

2:34:43.160 --> 2:34:47.160
 So that's like 11 o clock at night.

2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:52.160
 I'm in the parking lot of the Charleston police Charleston County jail.

2:34:52.160 --> 2:34:58.160
 Me and a Secret Service agent standing there and Elizabeth had a friend that owned a limo company.

2:34:58.160 --> 2:35:08.160
 So she pulls up in a limo, gets out, pops the trunk, gets these two plastic containers out that have my clothes in them,

2:35:08.160 --> 2:35:17.160
 drops off the pavement, comes over, hugs me, call me later, gets in the car, drives off.

2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:20.160
 I'm sitting there crying like a baby.

2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:21.160
 Agent looks at me.

2:35:21.160 --> 2:35:22.160
 Is that your fiance?

2:35:22.160 --> 2:35:23.160
 I'm like, yeah.

2:35:23.160 --> 2:35:25.160
 He's like, I am so sorry.

2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:28.160
 And I'm like, yeah.

2:35:28.160 --> 2:35:29.160
 I had to.

2:35:29.160 --> 2:35:31.160
 She sounds fascinating.

2:35:31.160 --> 2:35:34.160
 Pull up an old limo.

2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:40.160
 I had $30 to my name at that point, $30.

2:35:40.160 --> 2:35:43.160
 The agent had to pay for my hotel room that first night.

2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:47.160
 So he drops me off, had to pay for the hotel room, buy me something to eat.

2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:53.160
 Soon as he drops me off, I take that $30, walk a half mile to Walmart by prepaid debit card.

2:35:53.160 --> 2:35:55.160
 So I can start back in tax fraud.

2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:59.160
 Soon as they get back to the hotel room, call Elizabeth Beggar to come see me.

2:35:59.160 --> 2:36:05.160
 She comes to see me and we talk most of the night and convince her to give me a chance.

2:36:05.160 --> 2:36:07.160
 I tell her that everything's going to be all right.

2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:08.160
 They're going to hire me.

2:36:08.160 --> 2:36:10.160
 I'm going to be this big consultant.

2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:13.160
 Lies, lies, just so she get back with me.

2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:16.160
 And she's like, okay.

2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:20.160
 And so we move from Charleston.

2:36:20.160 --> 2:36:24.160
 The field offices in Columbia, South Carolina.

2:36:24.160 --> 2:36:27.160
 And I'm breaking the law.

2:36:27.160 --> 2:36:30.160
 Even before I start working with them, I'm breaking the law.

2:36:30.160 --> 2:36:34.160
 And so they've got me in the office, the field offices.

2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:36.160
 They got this big war room in there.

2:36:36.160 --> 2:36:38.160
 I'm on a laptop outside line.

2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:43.160
 Laptops hooked up to a 50 inch plasma monitor on the wall.

2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:48.160
 They've got a desktop sitting directly next to me outside line.

2:36:48.160 --> 2:36:54.160
 Two secret service offices, officers in the room at all times with a South Carolina law enforcement officer.

2:36:54.160 --> 2:37:04.160
 My job is four to six hours a day, surfing the web, picking up targets, intel, teaching them how cyber crime operates, everything else like that.

2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:09.160
 For the first two weeks, they are extremely diligent.

2:37:09.160 --> 2:37:12.160
 They pay attention to everything that's going on, ask questions, everything else.

2:37:12.160 --> 2:37:17.160
 But the problem is, is that that shit gets boring real quick.

2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:20.160
 Because I'm very fast online doing that.

2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:22.160
 So they're like, what the hell is he doing?

2:37:22.160 --> 2:37:25.160
 And it gets tiring looking at a guy just doing that shit.

2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:34.160
 So after two weeks, they get lazy and bored and they start watching porn instead of watching me.

2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:39.160
 At the same time, they've got a keylogger and they've got, they've got Spectre Pro and Camtasia.

2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:43.160
 Keyloggers and taking snapshots of everything that I'm doing.

2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:46.160
 Every night it goes on a DVD rom on a spindle.

2:37:46.160 --> 2:37:51.160
 So I'm like, they're not going to go through that shit.

2:37:51.160 --> 2:37:53.160
 So I'm like, fuck it.

2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:57.160
 Start breaking law from inside the Secret Service offices while they're in the room.

2:37:57.160 --> 2:38:00.160
 Why not?

2:38:00.160 --> 2:38:03.160
 That continues for 10 months.

2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:11.160
 At the same time, the relationship with Elizabeth fell apart, completely fell apart.

2:38:11.160 --> 2:38:18.160
 Do you have an understanding of why it's just because of the, her heart got broken because there was lying.

2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:19.160
 It was the trust.

2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:23.160
 She felt like she did a lot to sacrifice for the relationship.

2:38:23.160 --> 2:38:33.160
 You got a woman there that she had even said it.

2:38:33.160 --> 2:38:41.160
 She was like, she had told one of her friends we were out having dinner one night.

2:38:41.160 --> 2:38:43.160
 And this is before I got arrested.

2:38:43.160 --> 2:38:49.160
 She told one of her friends that I was the only guy that ever asked her to stop using drugs.

2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:51.160
 Yeah.

2:38:51.160 --> 2:38:52.160
 Yeah.

2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:58.160
 I mean, I have to say that that part of the story is so, it's so powerful.

2:38:58.160 --> 2:39:03.160
 And then that she chose to do it and she chose to stop.

2:39:03.160 --> 2:39:07.160
 And she told me that there was one instance.

2:39:07.160 --> 2:39:11.160
 She told me that if she didn't marry me, she'd never be married.

2:39:11.160 --> 2:39:15.160
 And as far as I know, she's never been married.

2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:18.160
 And so it started to fall apart there.

2:39:18.160 --> 2:39:19.160
 Yeah.

2:39:19.160 --> 2:39:23.160
 Because I was a piece of shit.

2:39:23.160 --> 2:39:25.160
 Still, you didn't take a step.

2:39:25.160 --> 2:39:32.160
 By the way, can I just say how just moving it is, how honest you are, but thank you.

2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:34.160
 Thank you for being that person.

2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:38.160
 But at that time, you, there's still that lying.

2:39:38.160 --> 2:39:39.160
 Oh man.

2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:40.160
 Yeah.

2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:41.160
 Yeah.

2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:42.160
 Yeah.

2:39:42.160 --> 2:39:43.160
 So it's falling apart.

2:39:43.160 --> 2:39:49.160
 She had, she wants to start going to strip clubs and I'm like, fuck it.

2:39:49.160 --> 2:39:50.160
 Why not?

2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:51.160
 We'll go.

2:39:51.160 --> 2:39:55.160
 So we start going to strip clubs and she's, you know, she'll come back and begin wasting

2:39:55.160 --> 2:39:57.160
 and we'll have sex.

2:39:57.160 --> 2:39:58.160
 What have you.

2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:09.560
 And one night she looks at me and she was like, she was like, I think it'd be funny if you

2:40:09.560 --> 2:40:12.160
 got a blow job from somebody else.

2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:16.160
 And that got me.

2:40:16.160 --> 2:40:17.160
 That got me.

2:40:17.160 --> 2:40:20.160
 I was like, to me, that was the final straw right there.

2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:25.160
 I was like, she doesn't care for me anymore or anything else like that.

2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:27.160
 We've been going to strip clubs.

2:40:27.160 --> 2:40:36.160
 So I started dating another stripper and she knew something was going on and she looks

2:40:36.160 --> 2:40:39.160
 at me one day and she's like, why don't you just tell me that it's over?

2:40:39.160 --> 2:40:41.160
 And I looked at her and I said, it's over.

2:40:41.160 --> 2:40:42.160
 We're done.

2:40:42.160 --> 2:40:49.160
 And I told her, I was like, look, I said, whatever you want, we were renting an apartment.

2:40:49.160 --> 2:40:53.160
 I was like, whatever you want in here, take it.

2:40:53.160 --> 2:41:02.160
 And I said, not only that, but I'll make sure you got money for several months.

2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:04.160
 So you're all right.

2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:09.160
 And I was like, just leave me, you know, leave my TV and leave, leave me some, some plates

2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:10.160
 and stuff.

2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:18.160
 So I go to work that day at the secret service, come back that night and she's taking everything

2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:22.160
 and left a picture of herself in the bedroom on the floor.

2:41:22.160 --> 2:41:25.160
 I'm like, okay, I guess I deserve that.

2:41:25.160 --> 2:41:30.160
 So she's got, she was cool.

2:41:30.160 --> 2:41:31.160
 She was cool.

2:41:31.160 --> 2:41:37.160
 So I'm giving her a thousand dollars like every two weeks for some shit like that.

2:41:37.160 --> 2:41:42.160
 And it gets to the point because I'm doing this tax fraud from inside the offices.

2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:47.160
 Well, the debit card companies are pinging the cards.

2:41:47.160 --> 2:41:51.160
 They start to realize that, hey, some son of a bitch is stealing money using our debit

2:41:51.160 --> 2:41:52.160
 cards.

2:41:52.160 --> 2:41:54.160
 So they start to shut down the cards before I can pull cash out.

2:41:54.160 --> 2:41:57.160
 So I start not to have the money to send to her.

2:41:57.160 --> 2:42:02.160
 And I'm like, so she calls and she's like, look, I have to have money.

2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:05.160
 And I was like, well, look, I'm doing what I can.

2:42:05.160 --> 2:42:06.160
 You promised money.

2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:10.160
 And I was like, look, if you knew what I was doing to get this money, you wouldn't be asking

2:42:10.160 --> 2:42:11.160
 that.

2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:13.160
 And she's like, I need money.

2:42:13.160 --> 2:42:16.160
 My rent's behind by a month right now.

2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:18.160
 And I'm like, your rent's behind.

2:42:18.160 --> 2:42:19.160
 She's like, yeah.

2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:23.160
 So I was like, OK, so I pick up the phone, call the rental office.

2:42:23.160 --> 2:42:28.560
 And I was like, I just want to make sure that, you know, I'm sorry, I'm behind on the rent

2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:29.560
 for this apartment number.

2:42:29.560 --> 2:42:32.160
 Oh, no, that rent's paid up three months.

2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:36.160
 It's like, OK, hang up, call Elizabeth back.

2:42:36.160 --> 2:42:38.160
 I was like, you're behind on the rent.

2:42:38.160 --> 2:42:39.160
 And she was like, yeah.

2:42:39.160 --> 2:42:41.160
 And I was like, funny.

2:42:41.160 --> 2:42:44.160
 They just said you're up on it three months and she gets quiet.

2:42:44.160 --> 2:42:47.160
 And she's like, well, you lied to me too.

2:42:47.160 --> 2:42:50.160
 And I was like, you're right.

2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:51.160
 I did.

2:42:51.160 --> 2:42:52.160
 I did that.

2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:54.160
 I was like, but look, I can't do it anymore.

2:42:54.160 --> 2:43:00.160
 And that's the last time I spoke to her right there.

2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:07.160
 What happens is I was breaking law from inside the offices.

2:43:07.160 --> 2:43:12.160
 I had a buddy that his name was Sean Mims out of Los Angeles.

2:43:12.160 --> 2:43:16.160
 I had taught him how to do tax return fraud.

2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:18.160
 I told Sean, I go missing, right?

2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:19.160
 I go missing for three months.

2:43:19.160 --> 2:43:22.160
 I told him if I ever went missing, not to contact me.

2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:24.160
 And so I go missing.

2:43:24.160 --> 2:43:26.160
 Then I show back up online.

2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:28.160
 First day he contacts.

2:43:28.160 --> 2:43:33.160
 So he becomes a target and they identify him pretty quickly at that point.

2:43:33.160 --> 2:43:38.160
 He's set to be arrested sometime in March of, of six.

2:43:38.160 --> 2:43:40.160
 That's when he's set to be arrested.

2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:43.160
 Operation Rolling Stone was the name of the operation.

2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:45.160
 Nine people were supposed to be arrested that night.

2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:49.160
 So Secret Service goes and goes and arrest this guy.

2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:53.160
 They search his apartment and don't find anything.

2:43:53.160 --> 2:43:57.160
 The apartment manager comes out and explains to him how Sean has done all kinds of work

2:43:57.160 --> 2:43:58.160
 to the apartment.

2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:04.160
 As a matter of fact, he brought in $30,000 worth of Italian tile to put in the apartment

2:44:04.160 --> 2:44:05.160
 that he's renting.

2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:10.160
 And by the way, last night, he had a U haul out here and took out a whole shitload of

2:44:10.160 --> 2:44:11.160
 stuff.

2:44:11.160 --> 2:44:15.160
 So Secret Service comes back in.

2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:18.160
 They look at me and they're like, we need you to take a polygraph.

2:44:18.160 --> 2:44:22.160
 And my answer was, I ain't taking a polygraph.

2:44:22.160 --> 2:44:24.160
 So they're like, well, we'll throw you back in jail.

2:44:24.160 --> 2:44:26.160
 If you don't, I was like, call my lawyer.

2:44:26.160 --> 2:44:27.160
 Lawyer gets me on the phone.

2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:30.160
 He's like, you don't have to take the polygraph.

2:44:30.160 --> 2:44:31.160
 I was like, good, I'm not going to.

2:44:31.160 --> 2:44:33.160
 He's like, but they will throw you back in jail.

2:44:33.160 --> 2:44:35.160
 I was like, don't want to do that.

2:44:35.160 --> 2:44:38.160
 And he's like, uh, have you done anything?

2:44:38.160 --> 2:44:40.160
 And I was like, yeah.

2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:45.160
 And he's like, well, you can try to pass the polygraph.

2:44:45.160 --> 2:44:47.160
 I'm like, okay.

2:44:47.160 --> 2:44:50.160
 So I was like, let's take the polygraph.

2:44:50.160 --> 2:44:52.160
 They asked three questions.

2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:55.160
 The questions were, uh, have you talked to anybody?

2:44:55.160 --> 2:44:58.160
 Have you, have you been on computer outside of the offices?

2:44:58.160 --> 2:45:02.160
 Have you talked to the press, which I was interviewing with a New York Times writer

2:45:02.160 --> 2:45:03.160
 the entire time?

2:45:03.160 --> 2:45:06.160
 And then have you contacted or warned anybody about investigations?

2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:09.160
 And I felt polygraph completely.

2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:11.160
 So they revoked the bond.

2:45:11.160 --> 2:45:15.160
 Take me back down to Charleston County, throw me in a jail.

2:45:15.160 --> 2:45:21.160
 Three days later, Secret Service shows back up and pulled me out of a cell.

2:45:21.160 --> 2:45:23.160
 It's Jim Ramacone and Bobby Kirby.

2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:28.160
 And they were, I mean, honestly, I, they were good men and they gave me chances

2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:33.160
 upon chances to do the right thing and I was not ready to do that.

2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:38.160
 And, uh, Jim Ramacone and Bobby's in there and Bobby, I mean, Bobby was a friend.

2:45:38.160 --> 2:45:40.160
 I mean, he truly was.

2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:48.160
 I later on, a couple of years ago, I had a chance to, uh, couple of years ago, I had a chance to, uh,

2:45:48.160 --> 2:45:55.160
 to have lunch with the man and, uh, told him I was sorry for everything I did to him

2:45:55.160 --> 2:46:01.160
 because I got him and him and another agent fired and, uh, told him I was sorry for what happened.

2:46:01.160 --> 2:46:05.160
 And, uh, he told me then he's like, we were your friends, man.

2:46:05.160 --> 2:46:07.160
 We were truly your friends.

2:46:07.160 --> 2:46:08.160
 So they were good.

2:46:08.160 --> 2:46:09.160
 They wanted to help.

2:46:09.160 --> 2:46:10.160
 Yeah.

2:46:10.160 --> 2:46:12.160
 They want, they wanted you to be a good man.

2:46:12.160 --> 2:46:13.160
 Yeah.

2:46:13.160 --> 2:46:14.160
 Yeah.

2:46:14.160 --> 2:46:19.160
 What got me to the damn bad is, uh, I told him, I was like, man, I'm trying to be a better guy.

2:46:19.160 --> 2:46:22.160
 And, uh, he's like, Brett, you always were a good guy.

2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:24.160
 He just didn't know it.

2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:26.160
 And, uh, fuck, people like that.

2:46:26.160 --> 2:46:27.160
 Yeah.

2:46:27.160 --> 2:46:29.160
 We need people like that in this world.

2:46:29.160 --> 2:46:30.160
 Yeah.

2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:32.160
 You need somebody to basically believe.

2:46:32.160 --> 2:46:33.160
 Oh, man.

2:46:33.160 --> 2:46:35.160
 That you can be a good man.

2:46:35.160 --> 2:46:37.160
 So, uh, Jim Ramacone pulls me out.

2:46:37.160 --> 2:46:39.160
 He's the second in charge, in charge of South Carolina.

2:46:39.160 --> 2:46:43.160
 He's got the Miranda waiver in front of him, right?

2:46:43.160 --> 2:46:44.160
 And he looks at me.

2:46:44.160 --> 2:46:46.160
 He's like, uh, I'm playing hard ass.

2:46:46.160 --> 2:46:49.160
 Bobby's over here looking distraught and, you know, like a hurt dog.

2:46:49.160 --> 2:46:53.160
 And Jim's like, uh, here's the way this is going to work.

2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:57.160
 You're going to tell me everything you've done the past six years, or I'm going to

2:46:57.160 --> 2:47:01.160
 make up my mission in life to fuck over you and your family.

2:47:01.160 --> 2:47:03.160
 And he said, not just this case.

2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:07.160
 Once you get out of prison, I'll hound you the rest of your life.

2:47:07.160 --> 2:47:11.160
 Then he slides the Miranda waiver over and he's like, now you want to talk?

2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:14.160
 And I looked at him and I was like, nope.

2:47:14.160 --> 2:47:20.160
 He was like, he gets up, gets all red in the face, storms out on the way out.

2:47:20.160 --> 2:47:23.160
 He's like, fuck you very much.

2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:25.160
 So I go back to the cell a week later.

2:47:25.160 --> 2:47:30.160
 I was on only under under state charges a week later, judge rules.

2:47:30.160 --> 2:47:33.160
 They revoke the bond improperly.

2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:34.160
 Wow.

2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:37.160
 Oh, reinstates the bond.

2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:41.160
 Nobody calls the secret service to tell him I walk out.

2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:42.160
 I walk out.

2:47:42.160 --> 2:47:48.160
 I was dating this stripper and I told my mom, I was like, well, if they're going to

2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:51.160
 fuck me, they're going to have to find me.

2:47:51.160 --> 2:47:53.160
 I just went on the move.

2:47:53.160 --> 2:47:54.160
 Yeah.

2:47:54.160 --> 2:47:55.160
 I called this stripper girl up.

2:47:55.160 --> 2:47:58.160
 I'd given her like 60k, some bullshit like that.

2:47:58.160 --> 2:48:01.160
 And I told her, I was like, Kim, I need some money.

2:48:01.160 --> 2:48:03.160
 And she was like, what?

2:48:03.160 --> 2:48:05.160
 I was like, look, I said, give me $1,000.

2:48:05.160 --> 2:48:08.160
 I'll give you back $3,000 in two weeks.

2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:09.160
 She was like, okay.

2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:14.160
 So I met her in Augusta, Georgia and got the thousand from her and started

2:48:14.160 --> 2:48:16.160
 driving west on I 20.

2:48:16.160 --> 2:48:18.160
 No idea where to go to anything else.

2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:20.160
 Got to Dallas.

2:48:20.160 --> 2:48:23.160
 There was a prepaid debit card supplier in Dallas.

2:48:23.160 --> 2:48:27.160
 Went in, walked in the office, convinced the guy, social engineering, convinced the

2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:31.160
 guy to give me 60 prepaid debit cards without a driver's license, without payment

2:48:31.160 --> 2:48:33.160
 anything else he did.

2:48:33.160 --> 2:48:35.160
 And that started the run.

2:48:35.160 --> 2:48:37.160
 I ended up stealing from that.

2:48:37.160 --> 2:48:39.160
 I stole like 160k profit.

2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:41.160
 Used that to buy a Jeep Cherokee.

2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:48.160
 And the idea was to steal enough money to bug out to Florianopolis, Brazil and set

2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:51.160
 up shop down there.

2:48:51.160 --> 2:48:52.160
 Do it again.

2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:53.160
 That was the dream.

2:48:53.160 --> 2:48:54.160
 That was it.

2:48:54.160 --> 2:48:55.160
 That was it.

2:48:55.160 --> 2:48:58.160
 So I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.

2:48:58.160 --> 2:49:01.160
 I was in Las Vegas, Nevada one day.

2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:05.160
 I had stolen the night before I had stolen 160k out of ATMs.

2:49:05.160 --> 2:49:07.160
 Went in the next morning.

2:49:07.160 --> 2:49:12.160
 Signed up, signed on to cartersmarket.com, which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman.

2:49:12.160 --> 2:49:14.160
 And there's my name.

2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:16.160
 US most wanted on it.

2:49:16.160 --> 2:49:19.160
 And that gets your attention.

2:49:19.160 --> 2:49:21.160
 It was my real name with US most wanted beside of it.

2:49:21.160 --> 2:49:24.160
 Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all.

2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:25.160
 But then they did.

2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:28.160
 And it was talking about me being part of the secret service.

2:49:28.160 --> 2:49:31.160
 Operation Anglerfish, everything else.

2:49:31.160 --> 2:49:36.160
 So of course they're all like everybody's after like, oh yeah, we're going to get this son of a bitch.

2:49:36.160 --> 2:49:39.160
 So I sat there looking at it and I was like, set it out loud.

2:49:39.160 --> 2:49:42.160
 I was like, well, Mr. Johnson, you've made the United States most wanted list.

2:49:42.160 --> 2:49:44.160
 What do you do now?

2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:46.160
 And I was like, I'm going to Disney world.

2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:51.160
 Literally, literally, literally said that out loud.

2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:56.160
 So loaded up the Jeep drove from Las Vegas to Orlando, Florida.

2:49:56.160 --> 2:50:01.160
 And got the two annual passes one to Disney world.

2:50:01.160 --> 2:50:05.160
 The other one to Universal Studios paid paid for a time share.

2:50:05.160 --> 2:50:09.160
 They were building these new time shares right off Universal Drive.

2:50:09.160 --> 2:50:13.160
 Building these brand new time shares paid for a time share nine months.

2:50:13.160 --> 2:50:14.160
 Cash.

2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:15.160
 I was like, we take cash.

2:50:15.160 --> 2:50:16.160
 Yeah, we take cash.

2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:18.160
 There's $12,900.

2:50:18.160 --> 2:50:19.160
 Then it wasn't furnished.

2:50:19.160 --> 2:50:23.160
 So I went down to a furniture store bought $30,000 in furniture.

2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:29.160
 They had seized a DVD collection of mine worth 30 grand, bought that back.

2:50:29.160 --> 2:50:32.160
 And proceeded to go to Disney world every day.

2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:35.160
 And that lasted about six weeks.

2:50:35.160 --> 2:50:38.160
 They used a trigger fish is what they use nowadays.

2:50:38.160 --> 2:50:42.160
 It's called a stingray to find me.

2:50:42.160 --> 2:50:48.160
 So one day I was like 1030 in the morning on Saturday, September 16 was the day 2006.

2:50:48.160 --> 2:50:51.160
 So yeah, 2006, September 16.

2:50:51.160 --> 2:50:56.160
 I was used to the builders coming around knocking, making sure everything was all right.

2:50:56.160 --> 2:51:01.160
 So I was asleep, heard this knock at the door and get up, look through the keyhole.

2:51:01.160 --> 2:51:02.160
 Nobody's there.

2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:03.160
 You know, people, nobody's there.

2:51:03.160 --> 2:51:09.160
 I was like, huh, open the door, step out into the hallway, walking down the hall is Bobby Kirby,

2:51:09.160 --> 2:51:14.160
 another South Carolina guy and a Orlando Orange County cop.

2:51:14.160 --> 2:51:16.160
 And they turn around.

2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:19.160
 They're like, hey, Brett, I'm like, hey, Bobby, how are you?

2:51:19.160 --> 2:51:20.160
 And it's like, we're good.

2:51:20.160 --> 2:51:21.160
 How are you?

2:51:21.160 --> 2:51:22.160
 And I'm like, I'm fine.

2:51:22.160 --> 2:51:23.160
 Would you like to come in?

2:51:23.160 --> 2:51:25.160
 And he was like, let's put you in cuffs first.

2:51:25.160 --> 2:51:28.160
 And I was like, that's probably a good idea.

2:51:28.160 --> 2:51:31.160
 So he was like, he walks in.

2:51:31.160 --> 2:51:32.160
 I like those guys.

2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:34.160
 He was like, have you got anything in here?

2:51:34.160 --> 2:51:37.160
 And I was like, yeah, there was $120,000 in the bedroom.

2:51:37.160 --> 2:51:38.160
 And he was like, seriously?

2:51:38.160 --> 2:51:41.160
 I was like, yeah, that an AK 47.

2:51:41.160 --> 2:51:43.160
 His face goes, why?

2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:44.160
 And he's like, you've got a rifle?

2:51:44.160 --> 2:51:47.160
 And I was like, no, I'm kidding with you.

2:51:47.160 --> 2:51:50.160
 He was like, he was like, okay.

2:51:50.160 --> 2:51:57.160
 So they throw me in jail in Orange County and they give me diesel therapy.

2:51:57.160 --> 2:52:03.160
 And diesel therapy is it took like two weeks to transport me from Orange

2:52:03.160 --> 2:52:06.160
 County, Orlando to Columbia, South Carolina.

2:52:06.160 --> 2:52:10.160
 And what happens is, is you stop at every county jail you possibly can go through

2:52:10.160 --> 2:52:13.160
 the processing, which is about six hours.

2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:17.160
 Once you get to your bunk, hey, time to transport you.

2:52:17.160 --> 2:52:19.160
 They do that on purpose.

2:52:19.160 --> 2:52:20.160
 On purpose.

2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:21.160
 On purpose.

2:52:21.160 --> 2:52:24.160
 Where is you down mentally and physically and everything?

2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:26.160
 I get to Columbia, South Carolina.

2:52:26.160 --> 2:52:31.160
 Now, while I was at Orange County, what happens is this inmate, because we were

2:52:31.160 --> 2:52:33.160
 in federal holding this inmate, he looks at me.

2:52:33.160 --> 2:52:34.160
 His name was Yeti.

2:52:34.160 --> 2:52:38.160
 And he's like, Hey man, you know, the only time you get off in federal prison is

2:52:38.160 --> 2:52:39.160
 the drug program.

2:52:39.160 --> 2:52:42.160
 I was like, well, man, I don't use drugs.

2:52:42.160 --> 2:52:44.160
 And he's like, you can find a drug problem.

2:52:44.160 --> 2:52:45.160
 Catch you.

2:52:45.160 --> 2:52:48.160
 And I was like, I can find a drug problem.

2:52:48.160 --> 2:52:52.160
 So what happens is, is every county judge, stop that on the way to Columbia.

2:52:52.160 --> 2:52:55.160
 I tell him I'm alcoholic and cocaine.

2:52:55.160 --> 2:52:59.160
 So by the time I get to Columbia, South Carolina, they've got this paper trail of

2:52:59.160 --> 2:53:03.160
 Mr. Johnson requesting help for drugs.

2:53:03.160 --> 2:53:09.160
 I had hired Strom Thurman's son as an attorney.

2:53:09.160 --> 2:53:13.160
 They make me drop him because I paid for him with illegal funds.

2:53:13.160 --> 2:53:15.160
 So they give me a public defender.

2:53:15.160 --> 2:53:19.160
 He gets a psychological evaluation ordered for me.

2:53:19.160 --> 2:53:23.160
 So psychologist comes in County jail, four hour interview about halfway through.

2:53:23.160 --> 2:53:25.160
 He looks at me as like using a type of drugs.

2:53:25.160 --> 2:53:27.160
 I was like, yeah, he's like, what do you use?

2:53:27.160 --> 2:53:29.160
 Cocaine, smoke or snort?

2:53:29.160 --> 2:53:30.160
 Snort.

2:53:30.160 --> 2:53:31.160
 How much?

2:53:31.160 --> 2:53:32.160
 An eight ball a day.

2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:33.160
 That's a lot.

2:53:33.160 --> 2:53:34.160
 Yeah.

2:53:34.160 --> 2:53:36.160
 Do you have any trouble out of that?

2:53:36.160 --> 2:53:37.160
 Yeah.

2:53:37.160 --> 2:53:39.160
 I can't get an erection.

2:53:39.160 --> 2:53:45.160
 And he looks at me and I'm looking at him like, because I had gotten that shit from

2:53:45.160 --> 2:53:46.160
 Boogie Nights.

2:53:46.160 --> 2:53:47.160
 Yeah.

2:53:47.160 --> 2:53:51.160
 So I'm like, and finally I'm like, is that right?

2:53:51.160 --> 2:53:54.160
 And he was like, it could happen.

2:53:54.160 --> 2:53:56.160
 I was like, okay.

2:53:56.160 --> 2:54:00.160
 So that makes it into my pre sentence report.

2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:05.160
 So all federal inmates, probation office and prosecutor, they do this detailed background

2:54:05.160 --> 2:54:09.160
 check to basically tell the judge how much time to give you.

2:54:09.160 --> 2:54:10.160
 All right.

2:54:10.160 --> 2:54:14.160
 So that drug bit with that interview makes it into the PSR.

2:54:14.160 --> 2:54:16.160
 So they have interview.

2:54:16.160 --> 2:54:17.160
 I mean, they have sentencing.

2:54:17.160 --> 2:54:18.160
 I had pled guilty.

2:54:18.160 --> 2:54:20.160
 They have sentencing.

2:54:20.160 --> 2:54:27.160
 The prosecutor, he stands up and this, this dude is screaming at this point and he's like,

2:54:27.160 --> 2:54:30.160
 Mr. Johnson's manipulated the secret service.

2:54:30.160 --> 2:54:31.160
 He's manipulated the prosecutor.

2:54:31.160 --> 2:54:35.160
 Then he points at the judge and he's manipulating you today, your honor.

2:54:35.160 --> 2:54:38.160
 We insist on the upper limits of the guidelines.

2:54:38.160 --> 2:54:43.160
 Well, I had been telling everybody in the jail that if they give me any more than 60

2:54:43.160 --> 2:54:45.160
 months, I am not staying.

2:54:45.160 --> 2:54:48.160
 So they were like, okay, sure.

2:54:48.160 --> 2:54:51.160
 So the judge looks at me and she's like, I agree.

2:54:51.160 --> 2:54:54.160
 I'm like, she says 75 months.

2:54:54.160 --> 2:54:59.160
 So I looked at my lawyer and I was like, can you get the drug program for me?

2:54:59.160 --> 2:55:00.160
 He's like, I don't know how I ask.

2:55:00.160 --> 2:55:02.160
 So he stands up.

2:55:02.160 --> 2:55:05.160
 Your honor, will you order the drug program for Mr. Johnson?

2:55:05.160 --> 2:55:09.160
 The judge says no, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.

2:55:09.160 --> 2:55:12.160
 So the secret service had told her, hey, he's full of shit.

2:55:12.160 --> 2:55:15.160
 So she's like, no, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.

2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:17.160
 I looked at my lawyer and I was like, what does that mean?

2:55:17.160 --> 2:55:19.160
 I was like, you're probably not going to get it.

2:55:19.160 --> 2:55:22.160
 And I was like, how soon can you get me to the camp?

2:55:22.160 --> 2:55:26.160
 And he was like, well, if you don't appeal, I can get you there pretty quick.

2:55:26.160 --> 2:55:30.160
 My exact words were, fuck the appeal, get me to the camp.

2:55:30.160 --> 2:55:32.160
 I'll take it from there.

2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:35.160
 He looks at me like I'm the biggest idiot in the world.

2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:38.160
 I get sent to, because you get a camp recommended.

2:55:38.160 --> 2:55:44.160
 I have friends, family members look for camps that don't have a fence around them.

2:55:44.160 --> 2:55:47.160
 They settle on Ashland, Kentucky.

2:55:47.160 --> 2:55:51.160
 Six weeks later, I'm at Ashland, Kentucky and pull up there.

2:55:51.160 --> 2:55:54.160
 14 foot fence, razor wire on top.

2:55:54.160 --> 2:55:57.160
 And I'm like, I don't climb fences.

2:55:57.160 --> 2:55:59.160
 So I go in.

2:55:59.160 --> 2:56:02.160
 First question I ask is, are there any jobs outside of the fence?

2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:05.160
 And he was like, guards like, well, you can work in the national forest.

2:56:05.160 --> 2:56:07.160
 And I'm like, no, I'll die out there.

2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:10.160
 He was like, well, you could do landscaping.

2:56:10.160 --> 2:56:13.160
 I'm like, I can run a weed eater.

2:56:13.160 --> 2:56:17.160
 Two days later, I walk into the landscaping office and the cop.

2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:23.160
 This is this, this genius of some of these people and institutions, the cop behind his desk.

2:56:23.160 --> 2:56:29.160
 The entire wall is a blown up photo of the compound and the outline area.

2:56:29.160 --> 2:56:33.160
 So I can literally sit there and plot where I'm going.

2:56:33.160 --> 2:56:34.160
 All right.

2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:42.160
 My dad, I hadn't spoken to that man in years and he shows up at my sentencing.

2:56:42.160 --> 2:56:48.160
 And stands up in front of the judge and he's like, your honor, I want to make sure Brett gets a good start.

2:56:48.160 --> 2:56:51.160
 He can live with me when he gets out, everything else.

2:56:51.160 --> 2:56:56.160
 Looking back, the man met that and I just thought his bullshit at the time.

2:56:56.160 --> 2:56:59.160
 So he starts to visit me in prison.

2:56:59.160 --> 2:57:04.160
 I mean, yeah, in prison, he starts to visit and about the third visit in, he looks at me.

2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:06.160
 He's like, I've been reading about you online.

2:57:06.160 --> 2:57:08.160
 I was like, yeah, he's like, yeah.

2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:10.160
 He's like, that's a lot of money you made.

2:57:10.160 --> 2:57:12.160
 I was like, yeah.

2:57:12.160 --> 2:57:18.160
 He's like, you think you can teach somebody how to do that?

2:57:18.160 --> 2:57:25.160
 And I'm like, so what I used to say, and again, it's this thing of, you know, really coming to terms with things.

2:57:25.160 --> 2:57:33.160
 What I used to say was, is I thought my dad was back in my life and he was just trying to use me.

2:57:33.160 --> 2:57:34.160
 All right.

2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:46.160
 The truth of the matter was, is that my dad hadn't really seen me except in that frame of crime, you know, being that criminal with my mom, everything else.

2:57:46.160 --> 2:57:49.160
 And I really think that's how the man was trying to communicate with me.

2:57:49.160 --> 2:57:56.160
 He wanted to connect with you in the places where you know, where you love, where you're interested in, where your addiction is essentially.

2:57:56.160 --> 2:58:01.160
 And what I did is I manipulated the man and helped him escape.

2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:06.160
 So I agreed to teach him how to do tax fraud and in return he had the only money he had to his name.

2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:08.160
 He had $4,000 cash.

2:58:08.160 --> 2:58:14.160
 So I manipulated him and he given me that and to drop me off a change of clothes, a cell phone and a driver's license.

2:58:14.160 --> 2:58:17.160
 The only driver's license he had was my driver's license, Brett Johnson.

2:58:17.160 --> 2:58:25.160
 So I was at the camp for, I don't know, six, eight weeks and the hardest worker that landscaping had ever seen.

2:58:25.160 --> 2:58:31.160
 At one point the cops got me on a mountainside with a broom sweeping off the mountain.

2:58:31.160 --> 2:58:33.160
 I'm like, yeah, we'll do that. Absolutely.

2:58:33.160 --> 2:58:35.160
 So you're building trust to the guys there.

2:58:35.160 --> 2:58:37.160
 Yeah, working my ass off.

2:58:37.160 --> 2:58:39.160
 And then six weeks I take off.

2:58:39.160 --> 2:58:43.160
 And I lasted, I think, two, three weeks, something like that.

2:58:43.160 --> 2:58:45.160
 U.S. Marshals, I made it 100.

2:58:45.160 --> 2:58:46.160
 They took off, you escaped.

2:58:46.160 --> 2:58:47.160
 Yeah, escaped, escaped.

2:58:47.160 --> 2:58:50.160
 U.S. Marshals, they're canvassing a three state area.

2:58:50.160 --> 2:58:52.160
 They found me, I think, 250 miles away.

2:58:52.160 --> 2:58:53.160
 It's like Lexington, Kentucky.

2:58:53.160 --> 2:58:57.160
 They found me in Lexington because I had to use my real driver's license.

2:58:57.160 --> 2:58:59.160
 I had a laptop.

2:58:59.160 --> 2:59:03.160
 I had prepaid debit cards and I had stolen identity information.

2:59:03.160 --> 2:59:09.160
 And kind of what the way it got me was I had dyed my hair this flaming red.

2:59:09.160 --> 2:59:10.160
 You know, I had this deep tan.

2:59:10.160 --> 2:59:12.160
 I didn't look anything like myself.

2:59:12.160 --> 2:59:18.160
 And I was at a hotel, had the curtains open, saw this guy.

2:59:18.160 --> 2:59:21.160
 I was on the laptop, saw this guy walk by.

2:59:21.160 --> 2:59:24.160
 He walks by the window and he stops.

2:59:24.160 --> 2:59:26.160
 And then he backs up.

2:59:26.160 --> 2:59:28.160
 He looks inside.

2:59:28.160 --> 2:59:30.160
 He knocks on the window.

2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:31.160
 I look up at him.

2:59:31.160 --> 2:59:32.160
 He's like, you.

2:59:32.160 --> 2:59:33.160
 I was like, me?

2:59:33.160 --> 2:59:34.160
 He's like, you.

2:59:34.160 --> 2:59:37.160
 Then he pulls out this badge and he points at it.

2:59:37.160 --> 2:59:41.160
 He's like, and then he points at the door now.

2:59:41.160 --> 2:59:42.160
 So I was like, oh, okay.

2:59:42.160 --> 2:59:44.160
 So I open up the door.

2:59:44.160 --> 2:59:47.160
 He's like, U.S. Marshals service.

2:59:47.160 --> 2:59:49.160
 So they arrest me and.

2:59:49.160 --> 2:59:50.160
 How did they track you down?

2:59:50.160 --> 2:59:51.160
 They canvassed that area.

2:59:51.160 --> 2:59:53.160
 They talked to every hotel, everything else.

2:59:53.160 --> 2:59:54.160
 I had.

2:59:54.160 --> 2:59:56.160
 So it's like a traditional like.

2:59:56.160 --> 2:59:58.160
 Traditional police work is what it was.

2:59:58.160 --> 3:00:00.160
 So it wasn't like from the internet, they kind of got something.

3:00:00.160 --> 3:00:01.160
 I don't know.

3:00:01.160 --> 3:00:02.160
 Just, just.

3:00:02.160 --> 3:00:03.160
 Good, good, good.

3:00:03.160 --> 3:00:04.160
 U.S. Marshals are outstanding.

3:00:04.160 --> 3:00:05.160
 Yeah.

3:00:05.160 --> 3:00:06.160
 Everything they do.

3:00:06.160 --> 3:00:07.160
 So they arrest me.

3:00:07.160 --> 3:00:11.160
 I go to a, I'm initially held at a county jail in Moorhead, Kentucky.

3:00:11.160 --> 3:00:12.160
 And that's bad.

3:00:12.160 --> 3:00:14.160
 That was one hell of an experience there.

3:00:14.160 --> 3:00:17.160
 But then I'm transferred after sentencing on that.

3:00:17.160 --> 3:00:18.160
 So sentencing.

3:00:18.160 --> 3:00:20.160
 Here's the weird thing.

3:00:20.160 --> 3:00:24.160
 So I spent like, I think two or three months at the county jail.

3:00:24.160 --> 3:00:26.160
 In Moorhead, Kentucky.

3:00:26.160 --> 3:00:30.160
 Get sentenced at my sentencing.

3:00:30.160 --> 3:00:33.160
 It happens so quickly after the initial.

3:00:33.160 --> 3:00:36.160
 Sentencing that they use the exact same pre sentence report.

3:00:36.160 --> 3:00:39.160
 The report that's got all that drug shit in there.

3:00:39.160 --> 3:00:41.160
 So I'm a sentencing.

3:00:41.160 --> 3:00:42.160
 Prosecutors there.

3:00:42.160 --> 3:00:44.160
 Secret services there.

3:00:44.160 --> 3:00:47.160
 Judge me and my attorney.

3:00:47.160 --> 3:00:48.160
 Prosecutor stands up.

3:00:48.160 --> 3:00:50.160
 He's like, your honor.

3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:55.160
 We would like it if you would consider that when Mr. Johnson was arrested, he had a laptop.

3:00:55.160 --> 3:00:56.160
 He had all this information with him.

3:00:56.160 --> 3:01:00.160
 Looks like he was engaged in identity theft yet again.

3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:03.160
 Judge looks at the prosecutor says, no.

3:01:03.160 --> 3:01:06.160
 Says, Hey, if you're going to charge him with it, you should have charged him with it.

3:01:06.160 --> 3:01:08.160
 I'm only considering the escape.

3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:09.160
 Then he looks at me.

3:01:09.160 --> 3:01:11.160
 And he's like, Mr. Johnson.

3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:16.160
 He said, it looks like by you keeping your mouth shut right now, you're really saving

3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:17.160
 yourself a pretty serious charge.

3:01:17.160 --> 3:01:20.160
 And then my response was, yes, your honor.

3:01:20.160 --> 3:01:22.160
 And he was like, then he opens up the pre sentence report.

3:01:22.160 --> 3:01:26.160
 And he's fingering through and he's like, it also looks like before you got involved

3:01:26.160 --> 3:01:29.160
 with all these drugs, you were a pretty good citizen.

3:01:29.160 --> 3:01:32.160
 I was like, yes, your honor.

3:01:32.160 --> 3:01:34.160
 And he's like, so here's what I'm going to do.

3:01:34.160 --> 3:01:38.160
 He said, I'm going to give him 18 months on the escape.

3:01:38.160 --> 3:01:39.160
 I was like, okay.

3:01:39.160 --> 3:01:42.160
 He said, I'm also going to give you, no, it's 15 months on the escape sound.

3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:44.160
 We'll give you 15 months on the escape.

3:01:44.160 --> 3:01:48.160
 He said, and I'm also going to order the drug program for you.

3:01:48.160 --> 3:01:51.160
 I was like, yes, your honor.

3:01:51.160 --> 3:01:59.160
 So the drug program gives you a year off and it gives you six months and halfway house.

3:01:59.160 --> 3:02:05.160
 So by escaping, I got out of prison three months earlier than what I should have gotten out.

3:02:05.160 --> 3:02:10.160
 So the original thing about drugs worked in the long.

3:02:10.160 --> 3:02:14.160
 Now the interesting thing with that, and it's the best lie I ever told.

3:02:14.160 --> 3:02:17.160
 Honestly, the best lie I ever told.

3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:20.160
 I spent eight months in solitary confinement.

3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:21.160
 Eight months.

3:02:21.160 --> 3:02:27.160
 And that's an experience because you ain't got no books for the first month or so.

3:02:27.160 --> 3:02:30.160
 Then they give you a King James Bible.

3:02:30.160 --> 3:02:31.160
 Yeah.

3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:35.160
 And then for a month, no books.

3:02:35.160 --> 3:02:39.160
 This is a pretty small and six by nine room.

3:02:39.160 --> 3:02:40.160
 Six by nine.

3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:41.160
 Yeah.

3:02:41.160 --> 3:02:42.160
 No books.

3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:43.160
 No books.

3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:44.160
 No paper.

3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:45.160
 No pen.

3:02:45.160 --> 3:02:46.160
 No pencil.

3:02:46.160 --> 3:02:47.160
 You're alone with your mind.

3:02:47.160 --> 3:02:48.160
 You got a mat, a toilet.

3:02:48.160 --> 3:02:49.160
 What's that like?

3:02:49.160 --> 3:02:52.160
 It's, you sleep as much as you can.

3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:55.160
 You're sleeping 16, 18 hours a day is what you're doing.

3:02:55.160 --> 3:03:01.160
 What about, what are you thinking about even just going back to like Elizabeth?

3:03:01.160 --> 3:03:03.160
 Oh, you go through all that.

3:03:03.160 --> 3:03:04.160
 The whole thing.

3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:05.160
 Every bit.

3:03:05.160 --> 3:03:06.160
 Your mom too.

3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:07.160
 Yeah.

3:03:07.160 --> 3:03:13.160
 You go through every single bit of that and so you're supposed to get out an hour a day.

3:03:13.160 --> 3:03:15.520
 Law says you're supposed to get out an hour a day.

3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:16.520
 That's the law.

3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:18.360
 That's not the way things actually happen.

3:03:18.360 --> 3:03:21.720
 What actually happens is, is you're lucky to get out an hour a week.

3:03:21.720 --> 3:03:25.480
 You take a shower twice a week and that's, that's it.

3:03:25.480 --> 3:03:26.800
 You got a phone call once a month.

3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:28.560
 Oh, so you don't get to see nature.

3:03:28.560 --> 3:03:29.560
 Don't see anything.

3:03:29.560 --> 3:03:31.160
 You get in solitary.

3:03:31.160 --> 3:03:32.160
 All right.

3:03:32.160 --> 3:03:34.400
 And it takes about a week.

3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:36.680
 The first week is the roughest.

3:03:36.680 --> 3:03:40.400
 You're bouncing off the walls at first week because you can't sleep, can't do anything

3:03:40.400 --> 3:03:41.400
 else.

3:03:41.400 --> 3:03:43.760
 Then you start to adapt to it after a while.

3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:46.560
 When that book does arrive, you're happy as hell to have it.

3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:51.960
 I'm well versed in the King James Bible, so you're happy to have it.

3:03:51.960 --> 3:03:56.560
 Then finally you get other books that are coming, that come in from that point.

3:03:56.560 --> 3:04:01.560
 Spent eight months at that and they sent me out to a real prison.

3:04:01.560 --> 3:04:07.440
 Big Spring, Texas, West Texas, where, have you been out there?

3:04:07.440 --> 3:04:08.440
 No.

3:04:08.440 --> 3:04:12.560
 Man, prairie dogs and tarantulas is what it is.

3:04:12.560 --> 3:04:13.560
 It got, no kidding.

3:04:13.560 --> 3:04:19.200
 It gets so hot that warnings come on the radio, radio telling you not to drive on certain

3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:21.760
 streets because they're melted.

3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:23.760
 That's that's big spring.

3:04:23.760 --> 3:04:29.200
 So if you've seen the movie from dusk till dawn, the opening scene is in Big Spring,

3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:32.640
 it's just hot, very hot.

3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:38.840
 So and that's where I find out what a real prison is and it's not ran by guards.

3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:41.880
 Prisons are ran by inmates and that's a fact.

3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:48.280
 So you're met at the door by whatever race you are is what happens.

3:04:48.280 --> 3:04:50.920
 So Big Spring is a converted Air Force compound.

3:04:50.920 --> 3:04:52.240
 It's a disciplinary prison.

3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:54.360
 So you get the bad guys are in there.

3:04:54.360 --> 3:05:02.440
 I go through processing and I'm walking up to the unit and I met at the door by a guy

3:05:02.440 --> 3:05:03.440
 named Nick Sandifer.

3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:06.480
 He's the treasurer of the Aryan Brotherhood.

3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:11.280
 And first question out of his mouth is any more white guys come in and shit.

3:05:11.280 --> 3:05:12.280
 I didn't know.

3:05:12.280 --> 3:05:13.280
 I was like, I don't know.

3:05:13.280 --> 3:05:14.280
 Four or five.

3:05:14.280 --> 3:05:17.480
 Next question is what are you in here for?

3:05:17.480 --> 3:05:19.360
 My answer was, cause I'm like, I got no worries.

3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:22.160
 My answer was computer crime, smiled at him.

3:05:22.160 --> 3:05:28.280
 And it turns out wrong thing to say because computer crime is not credit card theft or

3:05:28.280 --> 3:05:30.400
 hacking or any bullshit like that.

3:05:30.400 --> 3:05:34.280
 Computer crime in prison is child pornography.

3:05:34.280 --> 3:05:38.960
 So tell him that he looks at me like I'm a piece of shit, goes and gets his buddies.

3:05:38.960 --> 3:05:41.000
 They circle around.

3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:42.000
 What are you in here for?

3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:44.680
 I like how the Aryan Brotherhood has like lines.

3:05:44.680 --> 3:05:48.240
 They're like, oh yeah, this, this child porn.

3:05:48.240 --> 3:05:49.240
 That's it.

3:05:49.240 --> 3:05:50.240
 That's the bad guy.

3:05:50.240 --> 3:05:51.240
 They circle around.

3:05:51.240 --> 3:05:53.480
 What did you say you're in here for?

3:05:53.480 --> 3:05:55.880
 So I'm sitting there trying to explain it to them.

3:05:55.880 --> 3:05:57.320
 They're like, you know, you tell a good story.

3:05:57.320 --> 3:05:59.240
 You still said this.

3:05:59.240 --> 3:06:04.880
 Now computer crime basically really does mean usually the child pornography.

3:06:04.880 --> 3:06:05.880
 In prison.

3:06:05.880 --> 3:06:06.880
 Yeah.

3:06:06.880 --> 3:06:07.880
 Yeah.

3:06:07.880 --> 3:06:09.040
 And what you see, and that's one of the things you find out that the guys that are going

3:06:09.040 --> 3:06:14.280
 in there for child porn, they will tell them it's credit card theft.

3:06:14.280 --> 3:06:15.280
 So yeah.

3:06:15.280 --> 3:06:16.280
 Right.

3:06:16.280 --> 3:06:17.280
 They've learned.

3:06:17.280 --> 3:06:18.280
 So I'm that guy.

3:06:18.280 --> 3:06:20.880
 But you also don't, I mean, for people who are just listening to this.

3:06:20.880 --> 3:06:25.000
 You don't exactly look like a typical computer hacker.

3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:26.000
 That's true.

3:06:26.000 --> 3:06:27.000
 That's true.

3:06:27.000 --> 3:06:28.000
 That's very true.

3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:30.000
 But I don't look like the pedophile either.

3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:31.000
 That's right.

3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:32.000
 That's right.

3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:34.880
 But it's like, it doesn't make it seem like you're, I mean, I guess you're not wearing

3:06:34.880 --> 3:06:41.080
 a hoodie and you're, you're not like emo, dark, you know.

3:06:41.080 --> 3:06:46.720
 The way it actually works in prison, they won't attack you until they know.

3:06:46.720 --> 3:06:47.720
 All right.

3:06:47.720 --> 3:06:52.240
 So they have to see paperwork, which now in federal prison, you don't get transported

3:06:52.240 --> 3:06:54.340
 with paperwork because of that.

3:06:54.340 --> 3:07:00.920
 So they have to see paperwork or a guard will tell them what you're in there for.

3:07:00.920 --> 3:07:02.560
 Guards will tell who the pedophiles are.

3:07:02.560 --> 3:07:06.080
 So none of the guards told them that was anything.

3:07:06.080 --> 3:07:09.840
 So for the first month, they think I am, but they're not doing anything because they don't

3:07:09.840 --> 3:07:11.240
 know for sure.

3:07:11.240 --> 3:07:15.920
 At the end of the first month, I'd been talking to Kevin Polson over at Wired Magazine about

3:07:15.920 --> 3:07:17.740
 Max Butler.

3:07:17.740 --> 3:07:20.440
 He does an article about that shows up in Wired Magazine.

3:07:20.440 --> 3:07:24.940
 So at the end of the first month, Wired Magazine hits compound, front cover, all the story.

3:07:24.940 --> 3:07:27.280
 You would think, you would think it saved me.

3:07:27.280 --> 3:07:29.680
 So I'm reading the article really happy about it.

3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:34.160
 So what happens is, is four o clock is mail call, four o clock is a stand up count nationwide.

3:07:34.160 --> 3:07:37.200
 After four o clock is your mail call, they hand out all the mail for the day.

3:07:37.200 --> 3:07:40.360
 So the mail comes, I get the magazine, I'm reading through, I'm like, well, I'm good

3:07:40.360 --> 3:07:41.360
 to go.

3:07:41.360 --> 3:07:46.520
 Then it says Brett Johnson, secret service informant in the article.

3:07:46.520 --> 3:07:51.760
 So you're now a snitch, which is right up there with the pedophiles.

3:07:51.760 --> 3:07:56.320
 So we go to dinner after that at dinner.

3:07:56.320 --> 3:07:57.320
 You can hear it.

3:07:57.320 --> 3:07:58.320
 You can hear the chat.

3:07:58.320 --> 3:07:59.320
 We got a snitch.

3:07:59.320 --> 3:08:01.320
 I think it's that guy over there.

3:08:01.320 --> 3:08:06.120
 We got Warden next day shuts down the entire compound, calls me into his office.

3:08:06.120 --> 3:08:07.120
 They got security there.

3:08:07.120 --> 3:08:08.560
 You got the counselors there and everything else.

3:08:08.560 --> 3:08:12.600
 Warden looks at me, he's like, did you give an interview to Wired magazine?

3:08:12.600 --> 3:08:16.800
 I'm like, yeah, he's like, do you not know they will kill you in here?

3:08:16.800 --> 3:08:21.320
 I was like, he was like, he was like, do you feel safe?

3:08:21.320 --> 3:08:25.720
 Well, I know if you tell me you don't feel safe, they transport you.

3:08:25.720 --> 3:08:28.760
 Transport you means another eight months in solitary confinement.

3:08:28.760 --> 3:08:31.880
 You start to see shit in solitary after a while.

3:08:31.880 --> 3:08:33.200
 So I'm like, no, not going to do that.

3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:35.000
 So I'm like, completely safe.

3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:42.880
 He was like, look, he's like, if anybody says anything to you, immediately come to us because

3:08:42.880 --> 3:08:44.680
 they'll fucking kill you.

3:08:44.680 --> 3:08:47.160
 So they do a locker search, try to confiscate the magazines.

3:08:47.160 --> 3:08:48.160
 They can't.

3:08:48.160 --> 3:08:52.680
 The next day I walk into the unit, there's Nick Sander for laying on his bunk, magazine

3:08:52.680 --> 3:08:53.880
 wide open reading it.

3:08:53.880 --> 3:08:55.880
 I'm like, oh shit.

3:08:55.880 --> 3:08:56.880
 Walked up to him.

3:08:56.880 --> 3:08:58.400
 I was like, hey, Nick, what are you doing?

3:08:58.400 --> 3:08:59.880
 He's like, oh, doing some reading.

3:08:59.880 --> 3:09:01.320
 I was like, anything interesting.

3:09:01.320 --> 3:09:02.880
 He's like, it's getting there.

3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:07.200
 I was like, I was like, let me save you the trouble.

3:09:07.200 --> 3:09:08.520
 Take the magazine, turn it over to the page.

3:09:08.520 --> 3:09:11.000
 I was like, right there is what you're looking for.

3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:12.640
 He was like, man, I already knew.

3:09:12.640 --> 3:09:15.800
 I was like, do we have a problem?

3:09:15.800 --> 3:09:16.800
 And he looks at me.

3:09:16.800 --> 3:09:20.080
 He's like, is anyone on the compound you told on?

3:09:20.080 --> 3:09:24.800
 I was like, no, he's like, until someone gets here, you snitched on.

3:09:24.800 --> 3:09:25.800
 We're okay.

3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:28.240
 I was like, okay.

3:09:28.240 --> 3:09:32.120
 He's like, but I need you to do something for me.

3:09:32.120 --> 3:09:33.120
 All right.

3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:35.600
 So in federal prison, you got to have a job.

3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:36.600
 Everybody works.

3:09:36.600 --> 3:09:37.600
 Doesn't matter what you do, but you got to work.

3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:47.520
 I got a job in education teaching a lit class every Wednesday, 6, 8, 30 PM lit and had all

3:09:47.520 --> 3:09:51.440
 every area on the compound signs up for the lit class, had a couple of guards every now

3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:54.880
 that popped in and did we teach lit?

3:09:54.880 --> 3:09:58.880
 No, we taught fraud every Wednesday, 6, 8, 30 PM.

3:09:58.880 --> 3:10:04.720
 That's how I didn't get my ass beaten and my other job, I had two jobs with them.

3:10:04.720 --> 3:10:07.840
 The other job, you get to the point, it's weird, man.

3:10:07.840 --> 3:10:10.280
 You get to the point.

3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:14.680
 People walking off the bus, you know, immediately two groups of people, you know who the bank

3:10:14.680 --> 3:10:19.200
 robbers are immediately just by them walking off the bus, they're like, that motherfuckers

3:10:19.200 --> 3:10:23.680
 are bank robber and you know who the pedophiles are immediately.

3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:29.800
 So my job as the white guy was to approach the white pedophiles and have a conversation

3:10:29.800 --> 3:10:34.840
 and the conversation was basically, hey, don't know what you're in here for.

3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:37.320
 Don't care what you're in here for.

3:10:37.320 --> 3:10:43.220
 But if you got some sort of fucked up charge, you need to tell me.

3:10:43.220 --> 3:10:46.400
 If you tell me everything is going to be all right.

3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:49.520
 If you don't tell me, you see those guys over there?

3:10:49.520 --> 3:10:53.480
 If you start to associate with them or they start to talk to you and then they find out

3:10:53.480 --> 3:10:57.320
 you're in here on something, they're going to kill you.

3:10:57.320 --> 3:10:59.920
 And what are the things, pedophile?

3:10:59.920 --> 3:11:05.560
 Pedophile, rapist, anything that harms children, harms women, anything like that.

3:11:05.560 --> 3:11:10.680
 There are, it's like the mob, there's rules, there's an ethical code.

3:11:10.680 --> 3:11:16.840
 Even if you have the division between races on all of that, you still have these lines

3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:17.840
 drawn.

3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:20.040
 And there's hierarchy too.

3:11:20.040 --> 3:11:21.040
 Very much so.

3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:25.080
 And what that looks like in prison, depending on the, it depends on the security class that

3:11:25.080 --> 3:11:27.720
 you're in, what level prison.

3:11:27.720 --> 3:11:33.400
 But at that prison, what that looked like was you're not allowed to talk to anybody.

3:11:33.400 --> 3:11:35.560
 You're not allowed to watch television.

3:11:35.560 --> 3:11:37.360
 You can go to the library.

3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:40.880
 You don't associate with anyone except your own type.

3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:45.080
 If you do anything like this, we will kill you.

3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:49.320
 If someone wants to extort you, we will do that too.

3:11:49.320 --> 3:11:52.800
 And you won't tell on us, or we'll kill you.

3:11:52.800 --> 3:11:55.560
 So that's, that's the way that works at that point.

3:11:55.560 --> 3:12:00.000
 And everybody quickly learns this quickly, quickly.

3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:03.760
 And so typically the guys would say, I just want to do my own time.

3:12:03.760 --> 3:12:05.480
 That would be the line.

3:12:05.480 --> 3:12:09.840
 And it's like, okay, don't mess with him, all right.

3:12:09.840 --> 3:12:14.520
 Every now and then you'd have somebody lie and that would come with those types of consequences.

3:12:14.520 --> 3:12:23.120
 I got to see, while I was there, saw two people murdered, saw, went through three prison riots

3:12:23.120 --> 3:12:27.000
 and through my entire tenure in prison, saw four suicides.

3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:32.240
 The people who got killed, it was, so we had an outside, you had this track, a third of

3:12:32.240 --> 3:12:33.480
 a mile track.

3:12:33.480 --> 3:12:38.320
 You walk in counterclockwise and inside of the track, you got two handball courts.

3:12:38.320 --> 3:12:44.720
 So of an evening that happened both times, you, all of us would be walking, you know,

3:12:44.720 --> 3:12:45.720
 doing our exercises.

3:12:45.720 --> 3:12:49.560
 And at the top of the key, like a flock of birds, you'd see all the inmates start to

3:12:49.560 --> 3:12:53.000
 migrate down toward the gate.

3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:56.440
 So the first time you see that, you see that migration, you look up in the distance and

3:12:56.440 --> 3:13:01.600
 this other, that one of the inmates got another inmate down and he's just hammering his head

3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:03.840
 right into the pavement like that right there.

3:13:03.840 --> 3:13:07.560
 Well, guards don't stop that because a guard may get hurt.

3:13:07.560 --> 3:13:12.400
 So a guard is 15 minutes coming out to stop that until everything's over.

3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:15.320
 By that point, the guy doesn't have a head.

3:13:15.320 --> 3:13:17.840
 They shut the compound down and this is what happens.

3:13:17.840 --> 3:13:21.000
 So you shut the entire compound down.

3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:25.840
 They make two lines of the inmates and what happens is, the inmate walks into a room,

3:13:25.840 --> 3:13:28.880
 they shut the door behind the inmate, guard asks them two questions.

3:13:28.880 --> 3:13:30.400
 First question is, did you see anything?

3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:32.000
 The answer is no.

3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:35.680
 Second question is, if you had seen anything, would you say anything?

3:13:35.680 --> 3:13:36.840
 Answer is no.

3:13:36.840 --> 3:13:40.520
 The guard then says, get the fuck out and that's it.

3:13:40.520 --> 3:13:45.960
 Anybody that stays in any longer than that is automatically suspect.

3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:49.720
 So there was, there was one incident, I remember this Hispanic guy.

3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:56.200
 He's in there for a few minutes and everybody's like, what's going on?

3:13:56.200 --> 3:14:03.320
 So his people then call him over, explain to us what went on and it happens like that.

3:14:03.320 --> 3:14:09.080
 It's fascinating that because you talked about the network of trust in the, in the cyber

3:14:09.080 --> 3:14:18.160
 crime community and here's a network of trust in the prison crime community, trust, trust

3:14:18.160 --> 3:14:19.160
 matters.

3:14:19.160 --> 3:14:21.200
 Trust drives everything at the end of the day.

3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:27.600
 The riots that I went through, the first riot man, you're scared to death, scared to death.

3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:30.760
 You know, you've got the cops dressed up in the Ninja Turtle outfits.

3:14:30.760 --> 3:14:35.320
 You got the, the, the rubber bullets, the tear gas canisters, all that crap.

3:14:35.320 --> 3:14:39.360
 You got the inmates that are raising hell, scared to death.

3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:42.800
 The second riot, you calm down.

3:14:42.800 --> 3:14:44.760
 Second riot, you start to notice.

3:14:44.760 --> 3:14:46.320
 This is a racial riot.

3:14:46.320 --> 3:14:48.800
 This is typically in almost all ways.

3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:50.960
 It's Hispanic, South African Americans.

3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:55.680
 So you get to, you get to detect what is the motivation for the riot was reason and that

3:14:55.680 --> 3:14:56.680
 gives you some calm.

3:14:56.680 --> 3:14:57.680
 That's exactly right.

3:14:57.680 --> 3:15:00.280
 So the second riot, you start to notice this, hey man.

3:15:00.280 --> 3:15:01.280
 This ain't me.

3:15:01.280 --> 3:15:02.280
 This ain't our group.

3:15:02.280 --> 3:15:03.280
 Yeah.

3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:04.280
 Third riot.

3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:05.280
 No shit.

3:15:05.280 --> 3:15:06.280
 Third riot.

3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:07.280
 You lay in your bunk.

3:15:07.280 --> 3:15:12.040
 You let them, you let them wage war all around you and every now and then you have an inmate

3:15:12.040 --> 3:15:14.840
 that'll run up to you and they'll point to a locker and say, is that your locker?

3:15:14.840 --> 3:15:16.640
 And if you tell them, yes, they leave it alone.

3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:20.240
 If you say it's not my locker, they'll break into it and steal everything out of it and

3:15:20.240 --> 3:15:21.640
 go from there.

3:15:21.640 --> 3:15:22.920
 And that's what happens.

3:15:22.920 --> 3:15:28.040
 But so you did your time for five years, five and a half, five and a half.

3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:29.040
 You made it out.

3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:33.920
 I went through the, I told you it was a good lie that I told, I went through the residential

3:15:33.920 --> 3:15:35.420
 drug abuse program.

3:15:35.420 --> 3:15:41.400
 It's a nine month intensive therapy and the way I got to that, this counselor at Big

3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:44.920
 Spring, he, he bought this.

3:15:44.920 --> 3:15:46.920
 He wanted inmates to be educated.

3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:48.380
 He was a really good guy.

3:15:48.380 --> 3:15:49.720
 So he wanted inmates to be educated.

3:15:49.720 --> 3:15:55.120
 He got a discount on a game theory class set.

3:15:55.120 --> 3:15:58.440
 So he gets all these discs and everything and he's, he's asking, does anybody on the

3:15:58.440 --> 3:16:01.280
 compound know anything about game theory?

3:16:01.280 --> 3:16:05.040
 And somebody says, if anybody does, it'll be Brett Johnson.

3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:09.040
 So he comes up to me one day and my buggy is like, are you Brett Johnson?

3:16:09.040 --> 3:16:10.040
 I was like, yeah.

3:16:10.040 --> 3:16:12.720
 He was like, do you know anything about game theory?

3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:14.720
 And I was like, yes, I do.

3:16:14.720 --> 3:16:17.760
 So I start rattling off prisoners to lemon and everything else.

3:16:17.760 --> 3:16:20.200
 He's like, will you teach a class?

3:16:20.200 --> 3:16:21.200
 So I start teaching that.

3:16:21.200 --> 3:16:26.760
 I start teaching inmates, a public speaking and to make friends with this counselor.

3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:30.480
 So I, I get, it gets time where I'm supposed to be transferring out to this drug program

3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:36.600
 that they only had in Fort Worth and the transfers are taking like four or five months.

3:16:36.600 --> 3:16:37.600
 That's four or five months.

3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:38.600
 I could be out free.

3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:42.240
 So I walked, I went up to him one day and I was like, look, his name was Keely.

3:16:42.240 --> 3:16:43.240
 I was like, look, man.

3:16:43.240 --> 3:16:46.880
 I said, is there any way that I can get transferred out any sooner?

3:16:46.880 --> 3:16:50.240
 And he looks at me and he's like, Brett, I cannot help you.

3:16:50.240 --> 3:16:52.160
 And I was like, I appreciate that.

3:16:52.160 --> 3:16:54.000
 Thank you so much for even trying.

3:16:54.000 --> 3:16:59.240
 So he said that a week later, I'm on a bus by going to Fort Worth.

3:16:59.240 --> 3:17:00.240
 So he got to Fort Worth.

3:17:00.240 --> 3:17:01.240
 I got it.

3:17:01.240 --> 3:17:02.240
 Yeah.

3:17:02.240 --> 3:17:03.240
 I love it.

3:17:03.240 --> 3:17:07.040
 So it was a nine month program, 24 hours a day of cognitive behavioral therapy had nothing

3:17:07.040 --> 3:17:08.040
 to do with drugs.

3:17:08.040 --> 3:17:14.880
 It was all peer peer study stuff and CBT training and honestly, it's the best thing that could

3:17:14.880 --> 3:17:15.880
 ever happen.

3:17:15.880 --> 3:17:16.880
 It truly is.

3:17:16.880 --> 3:17:17.880
 That part.

3:17:17.880 --> 3:17:18.880
 What, what is it?

3:17:18.880 --> 3:17:21.720
 What was the thing that changed you as a man?

3:17:21.720 --> 3:17:24.800
 Was it the solitary confinement?

3:17:24.800 --> 3:17:25.800
 Was it the years?

3:17:25.800 --> 3:17:30.680
 Was it losing the people you loved or was it that behavioral therapy?

3:17:30.680 --> 3:17:32.080
 It's a combination, man.

3:17:32.080 --> 3:17:33.080
 It's a combination.

3:17:33.080 --> 3:17:36.560
 It was, so my sister disowns me.

3:17:36.560 --> 3:17:41.080
 The only person I had in my life, you know, I mean, me and my sister, that's it.

3:17:41.080 --> 3:17:42.080
 You know?

3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:43.080
 I mean, yeah, I loved Elizabeth.

3:17:43.080 --> 3:17:47.160
 I love my wife now, but you know, it's me and my sister.

3:17:47.160 --> 3:17:49.360
 We went through all that shit together.

3:17:49.360 --> 3:17:53.920
 So Denise disowns me, she doesn't talk to me for an entire year when all this stuff

3:17:53.920 --> 3:17:54.920
 happens.

3:17:54.920 --> 3:18:01.080
 And, uh, after I get arrested on the escape, she, uh, she ends up driving seven hours to

3:18:01.080 --> 3:18:05.080
 come see me to tell me she loves me and I don't see her again for five and a half years.

3:18:05.080 --> 3:18:06.080
 Yeah.

3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:07.080
 Yeah.

3:18:07.080 --> 3:18:08.080
 So that's, that's really the first turnaround.

3:18:08.080 --> 3:18:12.800
 Took me two and a half years in prison to accept responsibility.

3:18:12.800 --> 3:18:13.800
 Two and a half.

3:18:13.800 --> 3:18:14.800
 That was amazing that she did that.

3:18:14.800 --> 3:18:15.800
 Yeah.

3:18:15.800 --> 3:18:16.800
 She drove down.

3:18:16.800 --> 3:18:17.800
 Yeah.

3:18:17.800 --> 3:18:18.800
 She did that.

3:18:18.800 --> 3:18:19.800
 Yeah.

3:18:19.800 --> 3:18:23.320
 She, uh, saw me for 10 minutes, tell me she loves me and, uh, then I don't see her again.

3:18:23.320 --> 3:18:24.320
 Planted the seed.

3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:25.320
 Yeah.

3:18:25.320 --> 3:18:26.320
 Yeah.

3:18:26.320 --> 3:18:27.320
 Yeah.

3:18:27.320 --> 3:18:28.320
 So, uh, but yeah, you had time to think.

3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:29.320
 Yeah.

3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:30.320
 Over those years.

3:18:30.320 --> 3:18:31.320
 Yeah.

3:18:31.320 --> 3:18:32.920
 Took two and a half years to, uh, to realize that, you know, I didn't commit crime because

3:18:32.920 --> 3:18:35.320
 of stripper girlfriends or wives or family.

3:18:35.320 --> 3:18:42.480
 I committed it because I wanted to, chose to, and, um, that's the first turnaround.

3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:47.440
 Second turnaround is like the CBT training, you know, that, um, it didn't, it didn't really

3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:49.560
 hit while I was in prison.

3:18:49.560 --> 3:18:54.840
 You know, I went through it and they ingrained it in you, but until you choose to, to make

3:18:54.840 --> 3:18:56.880
 it work, it doesn't work.

3:18:56.880 --> 3:19:00.000
 So I got out in 2011, didn't want to break the law.

3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:01.000
 Did not.

3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:04.560
 And, uh, I was under three years probation, couldn't touch the computer.

3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:11.160
 I had a job offer from a Deloitte to run a cyber crime office in the UK, which that was

3:19:11.160 --> 3:19:12.160
 a no.

3:19:12.160 --> 3:19:13.160
 No, you're not moving.

3:19:13.160 --> 3:19:14.160
 And that's the computer idiot.

3:19:14.160 --> 3:19:20.200
 Oh, yeah, then, uh, had a job offer from a no before a fishing company, couldn't take

3:19:20.200 --> 3:19:21.200
 that.

3:19:21.200 --> 3:19:24.160
 I got to where I was trying to apply for fast food jobs.

3:19:24.160 --> 3:19:25.160
 That's a computer.

3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:26.160
 Can't touch that.

3:19:26.160 --> 3:19:27.160
 Okay.

3:19:27.160 --> 3:19:28.760
 Then what about a waiters position?

3:19:28.760 --> 3:19:31.160
 Well, that's a computer and access to credit cards.

3:19:31.160 --> 3:19:32.160
 Idiot.

3:19:32.160 --> 3:19:33.640
 Can't touch that either.

3:19:33.640 --> 3:19:39.240
 So literally could not get a job, could not, um, doing food stamps.

3:19:39.240 --> 3:19:42.600
 I had a roommate that, uh, penned half the rent.

3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:46.800
 They tell you when you leave prison to, uh, to get a job and something you care about

3:19:46.800 --> 3:19:47.800
 and you won't recidivate.

3:19:47.800 --> 3:19:48.800
 Couldn't get a job.

3:19:48.800 --> 3:19:57.520
 And what I had was a cat monster, the cat, that was a cat's name and, uh, I had had enough

3:19:57.520 --> 3:20:02.880
 money to feed that little guy and didn't have money to buy toilet paper for the apartment.

3:20:02.880 --> 3:20:05.320
 So, uh, there's a, I was on Panama city beach.

3:20:05.320 --> 3:20:07.400
 How long were you living like this?

3:20:07.400 --> 3:20:11.560
 It was a steady decline because remember I taught my dad how to commit tax fraud.

3:20:11.560 --> 3:20:14.480
 So he bankrolled a lot of that until he couldn't.

3:20:14.480 --> 3:20:18.300
 And then from there it's like, what the fuck do you do?

3:20:18.300 --> 3:20:21.120
 So I didn't want to go into computer crime at all.

3:20:21.120 --> 3:20:26.760
 And, um, I ended up shoplifting toilet paper, man, shoplifting toilet paper.

3:20:26.760 --> 3:20:30.780
 Just like for the basics, the basics of survival.

3:20:30.780 --> 3:20:36.080
 So about the same time I had a friend that, uh, this guy, I, I've been dating the same

3:20:36.080 --> 3:20:40.640
 type of women I had been dating, you know, these, you know, the unhealthy ones, the hot

3:20:40.640 --> 3:20:41.640
 unhealthy ones.

3:20:41.640 --> 3:20:42.640
 Yes.

3:20:42.640 --> 3:20:43.640
 Love.

3:20:43.640 --> 3:20:44.640
 Yeah.

3:20:44.640 --> 3:20:45.640
 That's how that works.

3:20:45.640 --> 3:20:46.640
 Yeah.

3:20:46.640 --> 3:20:52.400
 So I had a friend post an ad for me on plenty of fish and this woman responds, uh, my wife,

3:20:52.400 --> 3:20:56.680
 she responds and the pictures I had taken where these prison type pictures, you know,

3:20:56.680 --> 3:21:00.840
 the serious like, yeah, they were there and she sends me a message of, why aren't you

3:21:00.840 --> 3:21:01.840
 smiling?

3:21:01.840 --> 3:21:04.360
 And my response was that is my happy face.

3:21:04.360 --> 3:21:09.760
 So we start talking and, uh, we started dating.

3:21:09.760 --> 3:21:14.200
 And she ends up, she's that second saving thing, man, she, uh, I ended up moving in

3:21:14.200 --> 3:21:15.200
 with her.

3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:16.200
 I was going broke.

3:21:16.200 --> 3:21:18.360
 I was about to get kicked out of the apartment and everything else and she didn't say it,

3:21:18.360 --> 3:21:28.680
 but I think she knew it and, uh, moved in with her and I got a job and the job I got

3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:31.520
 my probation officer and let me have a cell phone.

3:21:31.520 --> 3:21:32.920
 I was going through Craig's list.

3:21:32.920 --> 3:21:35.960
 This guy was advertising for landscaping called him up.

3:21:35.960 --> 3:21:39.520
 His name was Dustin Duramus called him up and he's like, come on down.

3:21:39.520 --> 3:21:40.520
 Don't talk to me.

3:21:40.520 --> 3:21:43.920
 So he was running this business him and his brother were out of his house.

3:21:43.920 --> 3:21:46.320
 So I'm sitting there talking to him for about 20 minutes.

3:21:46.320 --> 3:21:48.080
 He looks at me and he's like, can I ask you a question?

3:21:48.080 --> 3:21:51.360
 And I was like, yeah, he's like, are you on the run or something?

3:21:51.360 --> 3:21:53.360
 So I'm like, no, why?

3:21:53.360 --> 3:21:58.120
 And he's like, well, you just don't look like the kind of guy that do this.

3:21:58.120 --> 3:21:59.920
 So I told him, I was like, this is who I am.

3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:01.320
 It's what I've done.

3:22:01.320 --> 3:22:05.960
 And, uh, he looks at me and he's like, man, I got to think about that.

3:22:05.960 --> 3:22:10.520
 So he, uh, he tells me to go on home that was a Friday, Sunday evening.

3:22:10.520 --> 3:22:17.880
 He gives me a call and he was like, Brett is like, if I hire you, will you actually work?

3:22:17.880 --> 3:22:21.680
 And I told him, I was like, Dustin, if you'll give me a job, I promise I'll work my ass off.

3:22:21.680 --> 3:22:23.800
 And he's like, show up six o clock.

3:22:23.800 --> 3:22:25.240
 I was like, all right.

3:22:25.240 --> 3:22:32.400
 So my job was to push a lawnmower 10 hours a day, five days a week for $400 a week and

3:22:32.400 --> 3:22:33.400
 busted my ass.

3:22:33.400 --> 3:22:40.800
 I hit it so hard I would, uh, I had come in of a night and pass out, wake up the next

3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:42.480
 morning and hit it again.

3:22:42.480 --> 3:22:46.360
 And, uh, it got to the point.

3:22:46.360 --> 3:22:51.480
 He ended up, uh, this dude ended up offering me to come in a partner with his business.

3:22:51.480 --> 3:22:55.040
 His brother dropped out and he, uh, by that point, I've not learned everything on the

3:22:55.040 --> 3:22:56.040
 business and everything.

3:22:56.040 --> 3:22:59.760
 And he was like, uh, you know, if you'd like to come in, I'll cut you in half.

3:22:59.760 --> 3:23:02.120
 And I was like, Dustin, I don't, I can't do it.

3:23:02.120 --> 3:23:06.000
 Cause I wasn't making any money when he didn't want to pay me anymore until, you know, he

3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:07.760
 was able to do more.

3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:13.840
 And, uh, I thought I found another job doing something else and in a speech, I say it got

3:23:13.840 --> 3:23:15.560
 cold in the grass, started to stop growing.

3:23:15.560 --> 3:23:19.720
 The truth of the matter was, is I thought I found another job, uh, guy was offering to

3:23:19.720 --> 3:23:26.880
 pay me $1,500 a week doing the, uh, sales for, uh, uh, oil rig training was what it was.

3:23:26.880 --> 3:23:35.440
 And, uh, I accepted the job, I quit working for Dustin and the guy, uh, I told him before

3:23:35.440 --> 3:23:38.400
 he even offered me a job, I told him what, you know, my criminal history, cause I was

3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:41.120
 required to do that.

3:23:41.120 --> 3:23:42.280
 So I was supposed to start work.

3:23:42.280 --> 3:23:44.760
 Well, he calls me and tells me if he can't hire me.

3:23:44.760 --> 3:23:49.040
 So I'm out of work and Dustin's already hired somebody else by that point.

3:23:49.040 --> 3:23:51.960
 So I can't go back with him.

3:23:51.960 --> 3:24:02.480
 And, uh, I'm that guy again, man, I, I, it's important for me to, uh, to show value in

3:24:02.480 --> 3:24:03.480
 a relationship.

3:24:03.480 --> 3:24:04.480
 All right.

3:24:04.480 --> 3:24:13.480
 So, uh, Michelle was on the one working and I'm like, I got to do something and, uh,

3:24:13.480 --> 3:24:14.480
 I get it in my head.

3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:17.840
 I was like, you know, if nothing else, I can just bring food in the house.

3:24:17.840 --> 3:24:21.560
 She was only making, I think she was, she was, I mean, we were headed hard, you know,

3:24:21.560 --> 3:24:25.600
 it was just her, her working and, uh, I was like, I didn't know if I could bring food

3:24:25.600 --> 3:24:33.160
 in the house and get on the dark web, get some stolen credit cards, start ordering

3:24:33.160 --> 3:24:34.160
 food.

3:24:34.160 --> 3:24:35.160
 Well, it gets worse than that.

3:24:35.160 --> 3:24:40.560
 It, uh, you know, she's got two sons there, so I'm like, well, they need clothes.

3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:44.240
 So he started stealing clothes and it continues like that.

3:24:44.240 --> 3:24:45.240
 I get arrested.

3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:48.680
 I get arrested, uh, on a food order.

3:24:48.680 --> 3:24:54.920
 And, uh, Michelle didn't know what I was doing, so she, uh, she had been to work and

3:24:54.920 --> 3:24:55.920
 she was coming back from work.

3:24:55.920 --> 3:25:00.160
 I get arrested and I'm like, uh, they let me make a phone call and I call her and I

3:25:00.160 --> 3:25:01.160
 say, come to police station.

3:25:01.160 --> 3:25:06.920
 I've been arrested and, uh, she shows up and, uh, she didn't know I'd been doing that.

3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:12.680
 My probation officer, of course, he didn't know or anything else, um, at my sentencing

3:25:12.680 --> 3:25:21.560
 for that probation officer was there, prosecutor, the judge, us marshals, Michelle and me, Michelle

3:25:21.560 --> 3:25:25.440
 stands up and she tells the judge that I'm a better dad to her kids than their actual

3:25:25.440 --> 3:25:27.240
 father is.

3:25:27.240 --> 3:25:37.200
 And, uh, but at that point I'm crying probation officer stands up and he was like, uh, we

3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:39.440
 think Mr. Johnson's a good guy.

3:25:39.440 --> 3:25:41.200
 We think this is a one time thing.

3:25:41.200 --> 3:25:44.040
 The judge says the same thing.

3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:51.800
 Judge sentences me to one year probation officer stands back up and he was like, uh, Mr. Johnson

3:25:51.800 --> 3:25:57.720
 at judge, if you can give Mr. Johnson a year and a day, he can get the good time and get

3:25:57.720 --> 3:25:59.640
 back to his family center.

3:25:59.640 --> 3:26:02.040
 So the judge amends the sentence to a year and a day.

3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:03.120
 So I served 10 months.

3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:08.400
 They sent me back to Texas and that's what I find out that, uh, Michelle didn't need

3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:10.560
 me for what I could give her.

3:26:10.560 --> 3:26:12.160
 She just wanted me for me that entire time.

3:26:12.160 --> 3:26:16.840
 She stands by me the entire time I do my 10 months, get out.

3:26:16.840 --> 3:26:20.280
 We get married after that and they kill probation.

3:26:20.280 --> 3:26:21.400
 So I can touch a computer.

3:26:21.400 --> 3:26:26.840
 They tell you, they tell you, they were like, you know, inmates, a felon, if nothing else,

3:26:26.840 --> 3:26:28.720
 he can sell cars.

3:26:28.720 --> 3:26:30.600
 Well it turns out you can't.

3:26:30.600 --> 3:26:32.720
 You can sell cars if you're a drug dealer.

3:26:32.720 --> 3:26:36.000
 If you're the guy that steals all the money and people's information, no, no, you can't

3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:38.080
 get a job selling cars.

3:26:38.080 --> 3:26:39.960
 So you can't get a job.

3:26:39.960 --> 3:26:40.960
 You're not.

3:26:40.960 --> 3:26:45.040
 And, uh, to this day, Lex, I know what my, what my triggers are.

3:26:45.040 --> 3:26:49.280
 I know what it would take to get me back into committing crime and I knew I'd go so far

3:26:49.280 --> 3:26:50.280
 at that point.

3:26:50.280 --> 3:26:53.360
 So I looked at Michelle and I was like, let me see what I can do.

3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:58.160
 Signed on to LinkedIn, reached out to this FBI super cop named Keith Malarski out of

3:26:58.160 --> 3:26:59.160
 the Pittsburgh office.

3:26:59.160 --> 3:27:05.160
 He was involved with my arrest and some associates and everything else and, uh, sent him a message

3:27:05.160 --> 3:27:07.760
 and the message was, you know, hey, I respect everything you did.

3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:09.840
 I think you did a great job.

3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:16.920
 By the way, I'd like to be legal and, uh, dude responded within two hours, two hours.

3:27:16.920 --> 3:27:21.880
 He, uh, gives me references, advice, takes me in under his wing, everything else like

3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:22.880
 that.

3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:26.000
 And from that point, man, it was the head of the identity theft council did the same

3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:27.000
 thing.

3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:32.080
 Uh, card not present group hires me to speak.

3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:37.080
 Microsoft hires me to, uh, consult with them and the Microsoft hire established enough

3:27:37.080 --> 3:27:42.480
 trust in the industry that, uh, I was all right from that point.

3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:48.840
 So now you're helping in many ways fight the very guy that you used to be.

3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:57.480
 So big picture advice, what, given that you were that guy, how do we fight cyber crime

3:27:57.480 --> 3:28:02.600
 today and in the next five years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, what advice do you have

3:28:02.600 --> 3:28:14.880
 to individuals, to companies, to governments of what, and also to, uh, Elizabeth, like

3:28:14.880 --> 3:28:24.240
 the humans, human beings that love, that live, that are friends with cyber criminals.

3:28:24.240 --> 3:28:29.800
 There's so many lessons to really be had from that.

3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:35.960
 You know, to me, the, the lesson, the, one of the big lessons to me is, is, uh, you can't

3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:41.160
 serve two masters, you know, if you're, uh, if you're that guy that is committing crime

3:28:41.160 --> 3:28:46.440
 or that person that's addicted or you're, um, you're in love with somebody that's addicted

3:28:46.440 --> 3:28:49.440
 or has that, they don't love you.

3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:50.800
 They love that addiction.

3:28:50.800 --> 3:28:51.800
 That comes first.

3:28:51.800 --> 3:28:53.200
 It's always going to come first.

3:28:53.200 --> 3:28:59.320
 So you have, you have to realize that you have to know when to, uh, kind of when to cut

3:28:59.320 --> 3:29:06.080
 somebody off, when to end something that, that knowing that they're not going to change

3:29:06.080 --> 3:29:08.640
 until they decided to change.

3:29:08.640 --> 3:29:11.840
 At the same time, you got to realize that the only reason I was able to turn my life

3:29:11.840 --> 3:29:15.840
 around is because people took that chance on me.

3:29:15.840 --> 3:29:16.840
 Yeah.

3:29:16.840 --> 3:29:19.720
 You know, that's really the only reason they believe that there's a good person in there.

3:29:19.720 --> 3:29:20.720
 Yeah.

3:29:20.720 --> 3:29:25.400
 If, if, if Malarski hadn't responded, if I hadn't had my sister, my wife, these companies

3:29:25.400 --> 3:29:30.000
 that, that initially gave me that chance, my ass would be back in prison for 20 years.

3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:32.040
 I have no doubt about that at all.

3:29:32.040 --> 3:29:33.040
 All right.

3:29:33.040 --> 3:29:38.480
 So you have to realize that, um, you know, cyber crime, a lot of companies that I talk

3:29:38.480 --> 3:29:44.840
 to, they don't really understand the, or appreciate the, uh, that networking aspect, that, that

3:29:44.840 --> 3:29:49.360
 trust aspect of how criminals establish trust with each other, how they work together.

3:29:49.360 --> 3:29:53.600
 A lot of companies think that it's a single player that's out victimizing them.

3:29:53.600 --> 3:29:58.640
 And when you really break down how cyber crime operates, that you've got a group of individuals

3:29:58.640 --> 3:30:02.120
 that are working together to hit you, but not only hit you, but they share and exchange

3:30:02.120 --> 3:30:03.120
 information freely.

3:30:03.120 --> 3:30:05.240
 You know, companies don't do that.

3:30:05.240 --> 3:30:08.560
 You've got privacy concerns, you've got competitive edge concerns, everything else.

3:30:08.560 --> 3:30:12.200
 Companies don't share information across the board like, like criminals do.

3:30:12.200 --> 3:30:13.200
 Criminals do that.

3:30:13.200 --> 3:30:14.960
 Um, you have to appreciate that.

3:30:14.960 --> 3:30:20.520
 You have to understand that, that big statistic that 90% of their tax use known exploits is

3:30:20.520 --> 3:30:23.680
 not the stuff we don't know about, it's the shit we do know about.

3:30:23.680 --> 3:30:25.080
 We're not doing anything about.

3:30:25.080 --> 3:30:29.400
 So the way to defend against cyber crime is like, there's a lot of low hanging fruit

3:30:29.400 --> 3:30:30.400
 they should fix.

3:30:30.400 --> 3:30:31.400
 A lot of that.

3:30:31.400 --> 3:30:32.400
 A lot of that.

3:30:32.400 --> 3:30:35.920
 Sort of a lot of basic stuff that's already vulnerabilities, updates, assistance, security.

3:30:35.920 --> 3:30:40.400
 Now that doesn't take care of solar winds or CNAP or anything like that.

3:30:40.400 --> 3:30:47.520
 It doesn't, but those instances, I mean, okay, that's a big instance, but I mean it is.

3:30:47.520 --> 3:30:55.800
 That in the full spectrum of, especially in the future, uh, because there's more and more

3:30:55.800 --> 3:31:00.440
 companies that are coming online, they're becoming digital and it's just more and more

3:31:00.440 --> 3:31:03.840
 and more and those vulnerabilities in terms of human nature.

3:31:03.840 --> 3:31:08.880
 So the first social engineering and the actual outdated systems, all of it, and some of it,

3:31:08.880 --> 3:31:13.640
 I guess is the, uh, I mean, you're exceptionally good at this is educating on the social engineering

3:31:13.640 --> 3:31:14.640
 side, right?

3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:17.840
 It's educating people and companies that you've got to do that.

3:31:17.840 --> 3:31:22.720
 You've got, and companies have to, you know, I made that point that they never report to

3:31:22.720 --> 3:31:23.720
 law enforcement.

3:31:23.720 --> 3:31:25.220
 That's companies and individuals.

3:31:25.220 --> 3:31:31.120
 You know, I've worked with Fortune 50 companies that will not press charges.

3:31:31.120 --> 3:31:36.760
 Instead, they'll have that insider or that criminal sign an NDA, they'll pay them off

3:31:36.760 --> 3:31:39.560
 and we won't mention the shit anymore.

3:31:39.560 --> 3:31:41.400
 You have to be, you have to press charges.

3:31:41.400 --> 3:31:42.400
 You have to report.

3:31:42.400 --> 3:31:45.720
 You have to raise the awareness of everyone in the group.

3:31:45.720 --> 3:31:49.920
 You have to be, it's that, it's that idea and I've talked about that before of understanding

3:31:49.920 --> 3:31:55.920
 your place in that cyber crime spectrum, the way a criminal will victimize you depends

3:31:55.920 --> 3:31:59.920
 on who you are and what you do as a person and as a business.

3:31:59.920 --> 3:32:02.280
 So you have to understand that design security around that.

3:32:02.280 --> 3:32:06.720
 You know, we've got 7,500 security companies out there, a whole lot of them are snake oil

3:32:06.720 --> 3:32:07.720
 salesmen.

3:32:07.720 --> 3:32:12.480
 So a lot of them, it's going to tell you that we're the one stop solution, but you're not,

3:32:12.480 --> 3:32:15.440
 you're not, you're a tool, all right?

3:32:15.440 --> 3:32:20.520
 And you may have a very good tool, but it's not the only tool that's needed to protect

3:32:20.520 --> 3:32:24.440
 against the attacks that are out there and we have to be open and honest about that kind

3:32:24.440 --> 3:32:25.440
 of stuff.

3:32:25.440 --> 3:32:26.440
 If we're not.

3:32:26.440 --> 3:32:30.280
 So I guess defending defense is not just like one tool.

3:32:30.280 --> 3:32:35.960
 It's a process of just like a diversity and just constantly educating people.

3:32:35.960 --> 3:32:36.960
 Absolutely.

3:32:36.960 --> 3:32:42.760
 The social side is constantly, because there's so many probably attack vectors in terms of

3:32:42.760 --> 3:32:43.920
 the software that you have.

3:32:43.920 --> 3:32:47.600
 If you look at it, that's that attack surface, you can't plug everything.

3:32:47.600 --> 3:32:52.400
 It's too damn large to plug everything, but you can do the best job you can possibly do,

3:32:52.400 --> 3:32:55.800
 but it takes a variety of tools to do that, all right?

3:32:55.800 --> 3:33:04.240
 The idea, and Arcos is big about that, but the idea is to take the cost of fraud to the

3:33:04.240 --> 3:33:07.920
 fraudsters so high that they basically try to pick another target.

3:33:07.920 --> 3:33:08.920
 All right.

3:33:08.920 --> 3:33:09.920
 And that's, that's the idea that you want.

3:33:09.920 --> 3:33:14.880
 You want it to be not worth the criminal's time to hit your company.

3:33:14.880 --> 3:33:16.960
 What about white hat hacking?

3:33:16.960 --> 3:33:24.720
 So like, you know, hacking for good, sort of testing systems and then giving companies

3:33:24.720 --> 3:33:27.040
 the vulnerabilities as you find them.

3:33:27.040 --> 3:33:28.240
 I think it's outstanding.

3:33:28.240 --> 3:33:29.240
 I do.

3:33:29.240 --> 3:33:31.440
 I think that I think pen testing, white hat stuff is outstanding.

3:33:31.440 --> 3:33:32.440
 I truly do.

3:33:32.440 --> 3:33:40.280
 I think that, um, that you have to, it has to be tempered with what is reality as well,

3:33:40.280 --> 3:33:41.280
 though.

3:33:41.280 --> 3:33:42.280
 All right.

3:33:42.280 --> 3:33:46.320
 You know, we've got a whole industry of, of people who try to sell RFID wallets that

3:33:46.320 --> 3:33:50.440
 I don't know of many RFID hackers out there on the criminal side, be honest with you.

3:33:50.440 --> 3:33:51.440
 Yeah.

3:33:51.440 --> 3:33:57.200
 So some of it is just like a psychological safety blanket that's not actually, uh, providing

3:33:57.200 --> 3:33:58.200
 any protection.

3:33:58.200 --> 3:34:04.680
 Yeah, by the way, you, uh, wrote on LinkedIn, uh, something about ID me.

3:34:04.680 --> 3:34:05.680
 What is it?

3:34:05.680 --> 3:34:07.160
 Well, is it a problem?

3:34:07.160 --> 3:34:08.680
 I was going down a rabbit hole.

3:34:08.680 --> 3:34:12.560
 I was wondering if you were going to mention them, you know, they, they lost, uh, I guess

3:34:12.560 --> 3:34:16.600
 I was partially responsible for them losing an $86 million contract.

3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:19.040
 What was the contract with the government?

3:34:19.040 --> 3:34:20.040
 The IRS.

3:34:20.040 --> 3:34:21.040
 Yeah.

3:34:21.040 --> 3:34:22.040
 Just the IRS.

3:34:22.040 --> 3:34:23.040
 So what is it?

3:34:23.040 --> 3:34:24.040
 So ID me is an identity.

3:34:24.040 --> 3:34:25.040
 Okay.

3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:26.040
 Backtrack.

3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:30.400
 So ID me is a marketing company that wants to say they're an identity verification company.

3:34:30.400 --> 3:34:33.400
 I just want to bring this up to see you get angry.

3:34:33.400 --> 3:34:34.400
 Okay.

3:34:34.400 --> 3:34:36.560
 My, I'll tell you what my issue is.

3:34:36.560 --> 3:34:37.560
 Yeah.

3:34:37.560 --> 3:34:38.560
 My issue is.

3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:43.040
 So it's, it's a company that's used for authentication by the IRS.

3:34:43.040 --> 3:34:44.040
 I guess.

3:34:44.040 --> 3:34:50.840
 Well, IRS Social Security Administration VA, uh, at 1.23 state unemployment offices, few

3:34:50.840 --> 3:34:51.840
 other services.

3:34:51.840 --> 3:34:59.440
 So I guess the idea is that you would be able to unlock your account or get, get, you know,

3:34:59.440 --> 3:35:04.600
 uh, authenticate yourself as a human being by, uh, using faith, your face or something

3:35:04.600 --> 3:35:05.600
 like that.

3:35:05.600 --> 3:35:06.600
 Yeah.

3:35:06.600 --> 3:35:07.600
 So private information.

3:35:07.600 --> 3:35:08.600
 They've got a, they've got a tiered system.

3:35:08.600 --> 3:35:09.600
 Yeah.

3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:13.720
 The verification they've got, uh, you can do, uh, they've got a free system, which is questionable

3:35:13.720 --> 3:35:18.040
 where you submit an ID and it's been shown several bypasses been shown.

3:35:18.040 --> 3:35:21.960
 And I don't want to talk about their security horribly bad because I want to be honest,

3:35:21.960 --> 3:35:24.720
 there are bypasses for a lot of security systems out there.

3:35:24.720 --> 3:35:25.720
 Right.

3:35:25.720 --> 3:35:26.720
 All right.

3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:34.240
 Um, the, the issue that I have with ID me is that their policies are somewhat questionable.

3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:38.840
 Um, I don't care if you're a private company that has those policies in place, but if you're

3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:44.880
 a government agency and you as a citizen are entitled to a benefit or a service of that

3:35:44.880 --> 3:35:50.400
 government agency, and then the government agency forces you to give up your complete

3:35:50.400 --> 3:35:53.560
 identity profile to a private company.

3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:59.000
 And then that private company uses that profile for marketing purposes to further profit things

3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:00.000
 like that.

3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:01.000
 I have a huge issue with that.

3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:03.800
 Um, I don't care if you're a private company that does that.

3:36:03.800 --> 3:36:07.840
 I just don't think the citizens need to be forced into doing that in order to get a benefit

3:36:07.840 --> 3:36:10.080
 or service that they're entitled to.

3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:11.840
 So that's, that's my big issue.

3:36:11.840 --> 3:36:17.520
 So that, I mean, given how much value, how much we talked about the value of identity,

3:36:17.520 --> 3:36:19.760
 you don't think that should be handed over lightly.

3:36:19.760 --> 3:36:21.640
 No, absolutely not.

3:36:21.640 --> 3:36:25.600
 And who would have thought that Brett Johnson would ever become a privacy advocate?

3:36:25.600 --> 3:36:29.000
 But here I am.

3:36:29.000 --> 3:36:38.760
 I mean, it's just, people don't understand or appreciate the value of who they are.

3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:41.400
 You know, and, and certainly you've got a host of companies.

3:36:41.400 --> 3:36:44.400
 Identity means not the only one, but you've got some of these companies that say, well,

3:36:44.400 --> 3:36:50.160
 we strip out the PII of the individual, we're just using the biometrics and the sites they're

3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:51.760
 visiting and things like that.

3:36:51.760 --> 3:36:52.880
 That's identity.

3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:57.080
 That is, you can still ping that one unique individual out of all using that information

3:36:57.080 --> 3:36:58.740
 stripping out the PII.

3:36:58.740 --> 3:37:02.080
 You can still ping who that individual is.

3:37:02.080 --> 3:37:08.480
 So having lived a life of crime for many years, I'm sure you've connected indirectly to a

3:37:08.480 --> 3:37:11.920
 large number of very dangerous people.

3:37:11.920 --> 3:37:13.080
 Directly indirectly.

3:37:13.080 --> 3:37:14.320
 Yeah.

3:37:14.320 --> 3:37:17.600
 But the network indirectly is even larger, right?

3:37:17.600 --> 3:37:18.600
 Oh yeah.

3:37:18.600 --> 3:37:19.600
 Oh yeah.

3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:25.920
 Are you, and I apologize for this question, are you ever worried for your life, for your

3:37:25.920 --> 3:37:27.120
 well being?

3:37:27.120 --> 3:37:36.200
 Like having seen a world that's really dangerous in ways that's not, that operates in the shadows.

3:37:36.200 --> 3:37:42.960
 You know, like I said, when I, when we started Shadow Crew and started that initial cyber

3:37:42.960 --> 3:37:47.920
 crime business, that world, violence wasn't there.

3:37:47.920 --> 3:37:49.080
 It came in later.

3:37:49.080 --> 3:37:53.920
 Now violence is inherent in the system to do the money, Python, but it's, it's part

3:37:53.920 --> 3:37:54.920
 of it.

3:37:54.920 --> 3:37:55.920
 Yeah.

3:37:55.920 --> 3:37:59.160
 The mob, the mafia are now part of this whole thing.

3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:00.160
 Cartels are part of it.

3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:01.160
 Yeah.

3:38:01.160 --> 3:38:06.760
 The drugs are inherently intertwined in cyber crime marketplaces because of the profit potential.

3:38:06.760 --> 3:38:09.000
 And with that comes a lot of violence as well.

3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:14.200
 The cartels already brought the violence that they're good at from the 20th century.

3:38:14.200 --> 3:38:15.200
 Absolutely.

3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:16.200
 Absolutely.

3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:17.200
 Into the technology of the 21st century.

3:38:17.200 --> 3:38:20.320
 Now, do I worry about that?

3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:26.440
 It's interesting that, that my family worries about that, all right?

3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:32.560
 I think I may be just too involved in it to, to appreciate that type of, of danger.

3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:35.080
 But my family worries about that.

3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:36.080
 They do.

3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:38.560
 Do I think it's a possibility?

3:38:38.560 --> 3:38:41.200
 I'm the guy that says what needs to be said.

3:38:41.200 --> 3:38:49.840
 I've made, I've built my trust in this industry by not being scared of calling out companies

3:38:49.840 --> 3:38:55.040
 and individuals and not being scared of targeting criminals or criminal groups.

3:38:55.040 --> 3:39:02.760
 Their honesty as a human being emotionally and intellectually is really refreshing.

3:39:02.760 --> 3:39:05.240
 It's, it's a gift and thank you.

3:39:05.240 --> 3:39:06.880
 Thank you for doing that.

3:39:06.880 --> 3:39:13.560
 Is there a device you can give to young people today about life?

3:39:13.560 --> 3:39:19.360
 You broke many rules, all the rules.

3:39:19.360 --> 3:39:21.080
 Some rules should be broken.

3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:26.360
 So if you look at somebody young today in high school and college thinking how they

3:39:26.360 --> 3:39:33.920
 can break the rules legally and live a life that's something they could be really proud

3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:36.080
 of, what would you say?

3:39:36.080 --> 3:39:39.600
 Biggest lesson I've learned.

3:39:39.600 --> 3:39:45.800
 You want your life to be one where you're helping people and not hurting people.

3:39:45.800 --> 3:39:50.880
 And that, that really hit me the first time I walked into Quantico.

3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:56.520
 You know, you see the, the brightest minds in the United States who give up a lot of

3:39:56.520 --> 3:40:02.000
 money, the opportunities of a lot of money because they believe in helping people.

3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:08.040
 Where I spent a career just hurting and harming individuals, that's, that's a hell of a lesson.

3:40:08.040 --> 3:40:12.600
 And I'm glad I'm there, but I would tell people out there, you know, it's fine to

3:40:12.600 --> 3:40:13.600
 want money.

3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:14.600
 It's fine to do that.

3:40:14.600 --> 3:40:16.520
 It's fine to test systems.

3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:19.480
 It's fine to circumvent the rules if you're not breaking the law.

3:40:19.480 --> 3:40:21.480
 It's fine to do all that.

3:40:21.480 --> 3:40:22.480
 I like doing that.

3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:23.480
 All right.

3:40:23.480 --> 3:40:26.440
 But if you've got the mindset, if you can just adhere to the mindset of helping people

3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:31.360
 and not hurting people, I think you'll be all right at the end of the day.

3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:37.640
 What gives you, again, given the dark web, given all the dangers out there, what gives

3:40:37.640 --> 3:40:40.600
 you hope about the future?

3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:45.600
 Looking into five, 10 years, 50 years, I mean hope for human civilization.

3:40:45.600 --> 3:40:54.080
 If we do, if we do all right, if we do, if we make it out of this century, what do you

3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:57.200
 think would be the reason?

3:40:57.200 --> 3:41:00.840
 What would be, well, that's a damn good question because I mean, we got a lot of bad stuff

3:41:00.840 --> 3:41:01.840
 going on.

3:41:01.840 --> 3:41:02.840
 We've got a lot of reasons.

3:41:02.840 --> 3:41:03.840
 A lot of reasons.

3:41:03.840 --> 3:41:08.000
 If I asked you the other question of how do you think human civilization will destroy

3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:10.760
 itself, I'm sure you have a lot of answers.

3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:14.760
 You know, what gives me hope is...

3:41:14.760 --> 3:41:16.520
 You see people working together.

3:41:16.520 --> 3:41:20.720
 The COVIDs have been a little bit different because I think too many people wanted to

3:41:20.720 --> 3:41:22.360
 play politics with it.

3:41:22.360 --> 3:41:27.440
 That's been the heartbreaking thing about COVID is it's in many ways pulled people apart.

3:41:27.440 --> 3:41:35.200
 Because a virus involves kind of being afraid of each other because, I mean, that was a

3:41:35.200 --> 3:41:36.200
 scary thing.

3:41:36.200 --> 3:41:40.200
 People talk about pandemics in that way, that you're afraid of other humans.

3:41:40.200 --> 3:41:41.720
 That is the most terrifying thing.

3:41:41.720 --> 3:41:44.680
 It's not the destructive nature of what it does to your body.

3:41:44.680 --> 3:41:50.280
 It's just that it pulls people apart and then you realize how fundamental that human connection

3:41:50.280 --> 3:41:51.280
 is to humans.

3:41:51.280 --> 3:41:52.280
 Absolutely.

3:41:52.280 --> 3:41:53.280
 Absolutely.

3:41:53.280 --> 3:41:59.960
 But, you know, we, as human beings, we do, when things really get bad, when things really

3:41:59.960 --> 3:42:03.720
 get bad, we do tend to respond and group together.

3:42:03.720 --> 3:42:04.720
 We do that.

3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:09.000
 When there's injustice, we see it.

3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:11.360
 We rise up.

3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:17.520
 I wake up in the morning and I watch Fox News and CNN so I can be pissed off at everyone.

3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:18.520
 All right.

3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:22.640
 The division, the outrage, they're really feeding.

3:42:22.640 --> 3:42:23.640
 They want you.

3:42:23.640 --> 3:42:25.240
 They want you to be angry.

3:42:25.240 --> 3:42:26.240
 Yeah.

3:42:26.240 --> 3:42:30.960
 That's what causes me despair and what I think that, you know, we just need to.

3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:32.760
 Elizabeth was very good.

3:42:32.760 --> 3:42:36.800
 She taught me one hell of a lesson because before I met her, I was a newshound.

3:42:36.800 --> 3:42:42.640
 It was beyond all the time, a couple of channels of it and she was the woman who didn't watch

3:42:42.640 --> 3:42:48.440
 the news at all and I didn't understand that back then, man.

3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:49.440
 But now I do.

3:42:49.440 --> 3:42:54.680
 You know, now I'm like, it's pretty smart, you know, don't need to listen to that bullshit

3:42:54.680 --> 3:42:55.680
 as it is.

3:42:55.680 --> 3:43:03.120
 That's why I love reading history books and people, you know, I just, I feel like that's

3:43:03.120 --> 3:43:07.560
 the right perspective on take on modern times, you know, how will this time be written about

3:43:07.560 --> 3:43:15.800
 in the history books and react to that, don't the daily ups and downs of the outrages, which

3:43:15.800 --> 3:43:20.480
 is getting worse and worse in terms of how quick the turnaround is in terms of the news.

3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:24.800
 I'll tell you what, I'm sitting here, I appreciate you talking to me.

3:43:24.800 --> 3:43:29.120
 I do because, you know, I'm talking about that relationship and everything.

3:43:29.120 --> 3:43:33.040
 It's really been this kind of realization for me on a lot of things.

3:43:33.040 --> 3:43:37.240
 So I really appreciate you asking those questions and everything, maybe able to talk about that.

3:43:37.240 --> 3:43:44.280
 I love it that you value, first of all, you're self aware how important love is in a human

3:43:44.280 --> 3:43:46.760
 being's life.

3:43:46.760 --> 3:43:50.520
 It can make you do some of the best and some of the worst things in this world and it's

3:43:50.520 --> 3:43:53.400
 good to think about that, it's good to think about that.

3:43:53.400 --> 3:44:00.480
 That is what makes us human is that connection and that love for each other.

3:44:00.480 --> 3:44:03.320
 What do you think is the meaning of life, this big, ridiculous question?

3:44:03.320 --> 3:44:05.240
 Why the hell, what are we all here for?

3:44:05.240 --> 3:44:07.840
 I don't think it is ridiculous, man.

3:44:07.840 --> 3:44:13.520
 To me, that meaning of life is finding out that lesson that we need to help each other.

3:44:13.520 --> 3:44:17.080
 If you talk, you ask about security, I didn't get to say that, but you know, everybody's

3:44:17.080 --> 3:44:19.600
 worried about themselves.

3:44:19.600 --> 3:44:25.640
 The way you solve that security problem is it takes everybody looking out for everyone

3:44:25.640 --> 3:44:26.640
 else.

3:44:26.640 --> 3:44:29.600
 That's how you solve that problem.

3:44:29.600 --> 3:44:34.120
 Like however you take, whatever journey you take to discovering that point.

3:44:34.120 --> 3:44:35.120
 Yeah.

3:44:35.120 --> 3:44:40.000
 I mean, with me, I've been asked a few times, do you regret anything, would you change anything?

3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:47.880
 I've done a shitload of despicable things in my life, but I'm at a point in my life

3:44:47.880 --> 3:44:52.840
 where I like who I am and I know that I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to be doing

3:44:52.840 --> 3:44:53.840
 in my life.

3:44:53.840 --> 3:44:59.520
 So when I change anything, as bad as a lot of that shit has been, I wouldn't.

3:44:59.520 --> 3:45:00.960
 I made you who you are.

3:45:00.960 --> 3:45:01.960
 Yeah.

3:45:01.960 --> 3:45:02.960
 The whole of it.

3:45:02.960 --> 3:45:06.000
 I mean, that's tried to say that, but it's true.

3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:07.000
 That's the weird thing.

3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:08.000
 It's true.

3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:09.000
 Yeah.

3:45:09.000 --> 3:45:10.000
 Yeah.

3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:13.920
 Also, you mentioned that you're thinking of launching a show.

3:45:13.920 --> 3:45:14.920
 What's it going to be called?

3:45:14.920 --> 3:45:17.800
 Because you've done a couple of podcasts, you're incredibly good at this.

3:45:17.800 --> 3:45:18.800
 It's so good at this.

3:45:18.800 --> 3:45:19.800
 I've done a couple.

3:45:19.800 --> 3:45:22.440
 I'm on a lot of podcasts and everything like that.

3:45:22.440 --> 3:45:27.960
 I had the broadcast with a friend of mine, Carice Hendrick, and that ended because of

3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:33.080
 the difference of opinion, depending on who you ask.

3:45:33.080 --> 3:45:38.600
 One of us was an asshole, and it may have been me, but then I did the Anglerfish podcast,

3:45:38.600 --> 3:45:42.600
 which I got to be honest with you, Lex, it was completely directionless and it was Brett

3:45:42.600 --> 3:45:45.160
 Johnson getting lazy.

3:45:45.160 --> 3:45:47.040
 So I ended that.

3:45:47.040 --> 3:45:50.480
 The Brett Johnson show is launching with the next.

3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:51.480
 That's the new one.

3:45:51.480 --> 3:45:53.480
 That's what the new one is called.

3:45:53.480 --> 3:45:57.040
 What do you think of doing with it?

3:45:57.040 --> 3:46:01.080
 Making a difference for one thing, but it's going to be talking about cybercrime security,

3:46:01.080 --> 3:46:06.640
 helping people, interviews, a lot of it's going to be solo.

3:46:06.640 --> 3:46:10.560
 Now I'm calling it the Brett Johnson show because it's going to handle crime, talk to

3:46:10.560 --> 3:46:13.520
 criminals and how they turn their lives around to a degree as well.

3:46:13.520 --> 3:46:15.680
 But there's some shit I want to bitch about too.

3:46:15.680 --> 3:46:16.680
 So figure it out.

3:46:16.680 --> 3:46:17.680
 I can tell you're good at this.

3:46:17.680 --> 3:46:18.680
 I'm a fan already.

3:46:18.680 --> 3:46:19.680
 I want to listen.

3:46:19.680 --> 3:46:20.680
 I want to subscribe.

3:46:20.680 --> 3:46:21.680
 You should too.

3:46:21.680 --> 3:46:22.680
 You're launching it soon.

3:46:22.680 --> 3:46:23.680
 Soon.

3:46:23.680 --> 3:46:24.680
 Next week.

3:46:24.680 --> 3:46:31.640
 So Brett, you're an incredible human being, the honesty, the love, I could just see how

3:46:31.640 --> 3:46:33.400
 much of yourself you put out there.

3:46:33.400 --> 3:46:36.840
 One of the best public speakers I've ever heard.

3:46:36.840 --> 3:46:40.320
 Definitely you should be in a Scorsese film about cybercrime.

3:46:40.320 --> 3:46:41.320
 100%.

3:46:41.320 --> 3:46:43.480
 I can tell you're a good actor.

3:46:43.480 --> 3:46:45.280
 It makes perfect sense.

3:46:45.280 --> 3:46:48.920
 Anyway, I'm deeply honored that you've spent your time with me today.

3:46:48.920 --> 3:46:49.920
 I am.

3:46:49.920 --> 3:46:50.920
 It was amazing.

3:46:50.920 --> 3:46:54.000
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brett Johnson.

3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:57.920
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:46:57.920 --> 3:47:04.560
 And now let me leave you with some words from George RR Martin from A Clash of Kings.

3:47:04.560 --> 3:47:10.520
 A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act, the good.

3:47:10.520 --> 3:47:13.680
 Each should have its own reward.

3:47:13.680 --> 3:47:25.040
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
