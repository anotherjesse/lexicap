 People whose favorite songs are their happy songs play it on their playlist about 175 times.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.640
 The people who love sad music play them about 800 times.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.280
 And they say that they feel connected to the sublime when they're listening to that music.

00:16.160 --> 00:21.760
 The longing for what you lack is the very thing that gives you what you're longing for.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.960
 So the longing is the cure.

00:22.960 --> 00:30.320
 The following is a conversation with Susan Cain, author of Quiet,

00:30.320 --> 00:33.360
 The Power of Introverts in the World That Can't Stop Talking,

00:33.920 --> 00:39.280

00:46.400 --> 00:49.920
 And now, dear friends, here's Susan Cain.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.040
 You've written on your website that, quote,

00:53.040 --> 00:57.040
 I prefer listening to talking, reading to socializing,

00:57.040 --> 00:59.360
 and cozy chats to group settings.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.640
 So I think this conversation in the podcast is going to be fun.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.760
 What's a good definition of an introvert?

01:05.760 --> 01:09.040
 Is something like those three things a good start?

01:10.080 --> 01:14.800
 It is a good start in terms of how introverts experience day to day life.

01:14.800 --> 01:20.800
 I think a good definition is one that some of your listeners will have heard many times before.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.600
 You know, the idea of where do you get your energy?

01:23.600 --> 01:27.760
 And for some people, they get their energy more from quieter settings,

01:27.760 --> 01:30.320
 and for other people, they get it more from being out there.

01:31.200 --> 01:36.240
 So a good rule of thumb is to imagine that you're at a party that you're really enjoying,

01:36.240 --> 01:38.480
 and you've been there for about two hours or so,

01:38.480 --> 01:42.080
 and it's with people you really like, and it's in your favorite place.

01:42.080 --> 01:42.960
 So it's all good.

01:42.960 --> 01:43.520
 It's all good.

01:44.880 --> 01:49.040
 An extrovert in a setting like that is going to feel charged up,

01:49.040 --> 01:51.280
 and they're going to be looking for the after party.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.840
 And an introvert, no matter how good a time they're having

01:53.840 --> 01:57.840
 and how socially skilled they are, there's this moment where you just wish

01:57.840 --> 02:00.000
 that you could teleport and be back at home.

02:00.560 --> 02:00.880
 Yeah.

02:01.520 --> 02:05.760
 And that the time before the start of the party to the time when that moment happens

02:05.760 --> 02:06.960
 is different for different people.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.480
 So like the shorter that is, the more of an inch where you are, is that that kind of thing?

02:10.480 --> 02:14.560
 The shorter the moment until you get to the place where you've got to teleport home.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.240
 Yeah, and then for extroverts, it's the opposite, right?

02:18.240 --> 02:22.880
 Like they're going to feel, you know, maybe they're working on, I don't know,

02:22.880 --> 02:27.440
 like focused on producing a memo that's really intensely interesting to them.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.240
 But if they're in that state of like solitary,

02:31.200 --> 02:33.280
 the solitary mode of really focusing,

02:33.280 --> 02:36.400
 they might get stir crazy a lot faster than an introvert would.

02:36.400 --> 02:41.840
 And so it doesn't have so much to do with what you're good at as how you get your energy.

02:42.400 --> 02:47.440
 And so for an introvert, the source of energy is what?

02:47.440 --> 02:49.600
 Silence, solitude.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.480
 And for an extrovert, it's interaction with other people.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.480
 What I'd really say is that, and this is neurobiological as well,

02:56.480 --> 03:01.040
 is that it has to do with how your nervous system reacts to stimulation.

03:01.040 --> 03:06.320
 And so for an introvert, you're feeling in a great state of equilibrium

03:06.320 --> 03:09.360
 when there are fewer inputs coming at you.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.440
 So they could be social inputs, but that's why an introvert in general would rather

03:13.440 --> 03:16.880
 like hang out with one close friend at a time as opposed to, you know,

03:16.880 --> 03:20.960
 big party full of strangers, because that's too many inputs for the nervous system.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.480
 And for an extrovert, the nervous system needs more stimulants.

03:24.480 --> 03:28.000
 So if they're not getting enough, they get that listless and sluggish feeling.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.960
 So if you're just walking through the world, like people listening to this,

03:32.960 --> 03:36.240
 but in general, how do you know if you're an introvert?

03:37.040 --> 03:42.800
 Like, how do you empirically start to determine if you are in large part an introvert?

03:43.520 --> 03:47.280
 Well, I would start by just asking that question of what happens to you,

03:47.840 --> 03:50.400
 you know, at around the two hour mark where you're having a good time.

03:50.400 --> 03:55.680
 Yeah, like, I mean imagine, but I also find, I'm curious if you have a different experience

03:55.680 --> 03:59.840
 from this, but from all the years that I've been out there talking about this topic,

03:59.840 --> 04:06.080
 I found that most people really seem to know once they're being honest with themselves.

04:06.080 --> 04:12.000
 And maybe that's the question to ask is like, if you imagine that you have a Saturday or a whole

04:12.000 --> 04:17.920
 weekend where you can spend your time exactly the way you want to with no professional obligations

04:17.920 --> 04:21.200
 and no social obligations, who would you spend it with?

04:21.200 --> 04:22.400
 How many people?

04:22.400 --> 04:23.280
 What would you be doing?

04:23.280 --> 04:27.840
 And what is that picture that you're painting start to look like?

04:27.840 --> 04:35.200
 Yeah, so there's nuance to this though, because I'm sure for extroverts to get energized by

04:35.920 --> 04:40.320
 stimulation, whether that stimulation with other people, like, it depends what that stimulation

04:40.320 --> 04:45.920
 is, right? Like, maybe you're not surrounded by the kind of people that you enjoy being around.

04:45.920 --> 04:53.520
 So, you know, maybe that has to do less with whether some characteristics is your personality,

04:53.520 --> 04:56.480
 more has to do with the fact what like what your environment is like.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.960
 That's always kind of the question.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.600
 Do you want to be alone because everybody around you is an asshole?

05:01.600 --> 05:04.720
 Or do you want to be alone because you get energized from being...

05:04.720 --> 05:07.520
 Well, I would hold the variables constant, I guess, I would say.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.720
 Keep the assholes constant and see.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.800
 And then there's the other thing you kind of observed that there's a lot of people

05:14.800 --> 05:22.160
 that will say they get energized from being alone, like people are exhausting to them or something like that.

05:22.160 --> 05:27.520
 But at the same time, when you see them at a party, they seem like the life of the party.

05:27.520 --> 05:32.720
 I know, and I hear from those people all the time, there's so many people like that.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.800
 What would you classify them as, exactly?

05:34.800 --> 05:38.720
 Is it ultimately as the source of energy, is the most important thing?

05:38.720 --> 05:41.280
 Or like, how the heck are they the life of the party?

05:41.280 --> 05:42.880
 It's a bunch of different things.

05:42.880 --> 05:50.160
 So first of all, just to say, like a big caveat to all of this is humans are just amazingly complex.

05:50.160 --> 05:54.560
 So you can't explain every individual human through these parameters,

05:54.560 --> 05:57.280
 even though I think the parameters are really valuable.

05:57.280 --> 06:02.240
 But that person at the party, it could be that they're more of an ambivert.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.640
 So they kind of are more in the middle of the spectrum.

06:04.640 --> 06:09.120
 It basically means someone who's not extremely introverted or extremely extroverted,

06:09.120 --> 06:10.240
 they're kind of in the middle.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.600
 So maybe at a party, their more extroverted side comes out.

06:13.600 --> 06:21.120
 Or it could be an introvert who's gotten really good at the skills of acting more like a pseudo extrovert.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.560
 And they pull that up at the moments that they need it.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.160
 So they've learned how to fake it.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.320
 Yeah. Oh, there's a lot of people like that.

06:28.320 --> 06:32.080
 And I know this because I think out of all the people on this planet,

06:32.080 --> 06:35.360
 you could be talking to, I've heard from the most number of those people.

06:35.360 --> 06:40.000
 Like they all come and tell me about their experience out in the world,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.960
 presenting a face that's different from what they feel.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.680
 So one of the things you talk about is, at least in the West,

06:45.680 --> 06:48.000
 we've constructed a picture of success.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.320
 And that picture is usually one of an extrovert.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.560
 Like when you imagine somebody who's a leader, who's a successful person,

06:56.560 --> 07:02.480
 that person has some of the qualities you would associate with an extrovert.

07:02.480 --> 07:07.920
 And so there's a lot of incentive for faking it.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.840
 Yeah, exactly.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.200
 If you want to be successful, you've got to be able to fake it,

07:13.200 --> 07:16.320
 to sort of hang with the rest of the team.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.680
 You have to be able to be outgoing and all those kinds of things

07:19.680 --> 07:21.920
 and not be drained by the interaction.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.720
 Yeah, but I mean, there are also a lot of introverts

07:24.720 --> 07:28.080
 who figure out ways to draw on their own strengths.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.840
 And they're incredibly connecting and successful,

07:31.840 --> 07:34.640
 and they're great leaders, and they're not actually faking it.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.000
 They're more just figuring out ways to do it their own way.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.160
 You see a lot of people like that.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.800
 Is there advice, is there lessons you can draw from that,

07:42.800 --> 07:45.760
 from just observing how you can be an introvert

07:45.760 --> 07:48.080
 and be in a leadership position?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.320
 Yeah, it's kind of like a mantra,

07:50.320 --> 07:53.120
 figuring out what your own strengths are and how to draw on them.

07:53.120 --> 07:57.760
 I think of a guy I know, Doug Conant,

07:57.760 --> 08:01.600
 who had been the CEO of Campbell's Soup for many years.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.680
 He's very introverted.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.720
 He's quite shy also by his own description.

08:06.720 --> 08:11.280
 And he really cares about people.

08:11.280 --> 08:15.840
 And so when he started at Campbell,

08:15.840 --> 08:18.320
 the employee engagement ratings of the company

08:18.320 --> 08:21.040
 were all the way at the bottom of the Fortune 500.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.360
 And by the time he stepped down, 10 years later,

08:23.360 --> 08:25.200
 they were all the way at the top.

08:25.200 --> 08:30.960
 And it wasn't that he was going out there and shmoozing people,

08:30.960 --> 08:32.160
 but he really did care.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.160
 So he would find out who were the people

08:34.160 --> 08:35.920
 who had really been contributing,

08:35.920 --> 08:40.560
 and he would write to them personal letters of thanks.

08:40.560 --> 08:45.040
 And these letters meant so much to people.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.280
 They would carry them around with them.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.680
 And during his time, the 10 years of his career

08:49.680 --> 08:51.440
 and during his time, the 10 years there,

08:51.440 --> 08:54.560
 he wrote 30,000 of those letters.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.720
 So that was his way of doing it.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.800
 That was his way of drawing on his own strengths.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.000
 And he did that together with, of course,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
 you sometimes have to go outside your comfort zone

09:04.000 --> 09:05.040
 no matter who you are.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.960
 So he was doing plenty of that too.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.480
 It's a kind of combination.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.600
 Yeah, the writing process and focusing

09:11.600 --> 09:15.200
 on the one on one interaction, I can definitely relate.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.800
 There's something deeply draining,

09:16.800 --> 09:19.440
 which concerns me about Zoom meetings,

09:19.440 --> 09:22.640
 because it's some weird brain manipulation.

09:22.640 --> 09:23.520
 Wait, say more.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.920
 Well, because you're not really engaged,

09:26.800 --> 09:30.320
 but it wears on you the same way that it does a party.

09:30.320 --> 09:35.840
 It feels like you're emptying that bucket for the introverts,

09:35.840 --> 09:38.640
 even though they're not participating at all in the meeting.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.200
 I mean, I suppose that's true for physical meetings too,

09:41.200 --> 09:43.520
 but with Zoom meetings or remote meetings,

09:43.520 --> 09:46.240
 it's so much easier to invite a larger number of people

09:46.240 --> 09:47.360
 into the meeting.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.240
 So you're draining more and more of the introvert energy.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.600
 And I'm probably extrovert too,

09:51.600 --> 09:52.800
 but the introvert, definitely.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.320
 There's, I mean, it's interesting.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.160
 I would love to understand that more

09:56.160 --> 09:58.880
 because there's more and more push towards remote work

10:00.400 --> 10:02.800
 without, I think, a deep understanding

10:02.800 --> 10:05.200
 of why these meetings are so draining on people.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.840
 I just anecdotally have heard from that.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.920
 But maybe that's because the managers,

10:09.920 --> 10:11.680
 the people who arrange the meetings,

10:11.680 --> 10:14.560
 are just not sufficiently yet aware

10:14.560 --> 10:16.160
 of the draining nature of them

10:16.160 --> 10:18.080
 so that they pull in too many people.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.520
 They schedule them too regularly,

10:19.520 --> 10:21.680
 so they need to adjust that kind of thing probably.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.680
 I think people are starting to realize,

10:23.680 --> 10:27.600
 but I would say one reason that Zoom is so draining

10:27.600 --> 10:33.040
 is because you can see your own self presentation

10:33.040 --> 10:34.640
 the whole time if you choose to.

10:35.280 --> 10:38.560
 And when you go into in person, you can't.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.960
 So you're kind of freed of thinking about that.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.560
 So it's like an extra cognitive load

10:42.560 --> 10:47.280
 that you're bearing the whole time. Oh yeah, that's brilliant.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.760
 And you might want to turn off the camera

10:49.760 --> 10:51.200
 so you can't see yourself, but then you feel like,

10:51.200 --> 10:53.040
 well, I have the ability to,

10:53.040 --> 10:54.560
 so I probably should be doing it.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.760
 And then that alone is the decision that you're making.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.080
 Yeah, there's probably studies on this now happening,

11:00.080 --> 11:01.680
 either half happen or are happening,

11:02.560 --> 11:07.760
 the effect of seeing your own face on camera

11:07.760 --> 11:09.200
 because it's reminding you that you're supposed

11:09.200 --> 11:10.400
 to be acting a certain way.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.440
 And that is especially a stressful thing.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.360
 Yeah, you can't be in the moment as much.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.160
 But I mean, for you, you make the decision

11:18.160 --> 11:21.840
 to do all your podcast interviews in person, right?

11:21.840 --> 11:22.800
 And so...

11:22.800 --> 11:25.440
 And that's even when it's very costly.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.400
 If there's any kind of chemistry

11:28.400 --> 11:31.200
 that contributes at all to the conversation,

11:31.200 --> 11:34.000
 which I think most conversations have chemistry,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.440
 even the boring work meanings, there's something there.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.320
 Because, yes, you're trying to solve a particular problem

11:40.320 --> 11:43.360
 at this particular time, but underneath it,

11:43.360 --> 11:45.360
 there's a team building that's happening.

11:45.360 --> 11:49.760
 And honestly, people also have told me about this,

11:49.760 --> 11:53.760
 why they enjoyed the Zoom meetings during the pandemic,

11:53.760 --> 11:55.360
 is like, they're lonely.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.400
 Yeah, yeah.

11:56.400 --> 12:00.400
 Like they, you know, it's annoying to have to sit

12:00.400 --> 12:03.120
 and listen to folks talk about nothing and so on.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.280
 But they tune in anyway, because it's kind of

12:07.280 --> 12:08.960
 lonely to sit there by yourself.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.320
 And that, I mean, there's a deep connection there

12:12.320 --> 12:15.440
 with other people, and that is especially true

12:15.440 --> 12:18.560
 when they're in person, which is a huge concern for me

12:18.560 --> 12:22.640
 for more and more offices from a capitalist perspective,

12:23.440 --> 12:27.040
 realizing, hey, why do we have these large office spaces?

12:27.040 --> 12:28.640
 Why do we have to get people together?

12:28.640 --> 12:31.840
 But I think in some deep sounds we do.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.480
 But then you also talk about that once we do,

12:34.480 --> 12:38.000
 we want to protect the introverts.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.080
 Like you don't want the open space, which office space,

12:42.080 --> 12:43.600
 which was a big fad for a while.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.240
 I don't know where people stand on that at this point.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.760
 Yeah, I think people are figuring it out

12:47.760 --> 12:49.360
 in a post pandemic context.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.200
 But I mean, I know what you mean.

12:52.240 --> 12:56.160
 So before I became a writer, I was a corporate lawyer

12:56.160 --> 12:57.680
 for like seven years.

12:57.680 --> 13:01.760
 And literally the only thing I miss from those years

13:01.760 --> 13:05.760
 is hanging out with people at the office.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.400
 Like, I don't know, just some of the funniest moments

13:08.400 --> 13:11.920
 I've had in my life came from being at the office

13:11.920 --> 13:14.240
 until midnight with the other people I was working with.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.760
 So I know exactly what you're talking about.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.400
 So I will say the office is there at that firm

13:18.400 --> 13:20.000
 and at most firms in those days,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.360
 everybody had their own office.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.960
 So it was like a dorm room, you know,

13:22.960 --> 13:24.160
 where it was like a long hallway

13:24.160 --> 13:26.400
 with everybody in their own little dorm room.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.520
 So you had tons of privacy, but you would also come out

13:29.520 --> 13:31.360
 and hang out with people.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.760
 You could just kind of roam whenever you want.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.280
 Yeah, yeah.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.600
 And whenever you roam, that means you're kind of open.

13:38.640 --> 13:39.600
 You're looking for trouble.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.000
 You're open for interaction.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.160
 And the extent to which you would keep your door open,

13:44.160 --> 13:46.320
 you know, was it wide open or was it half a jar

13:46.320 --> 13:48.400
 or just a little bit, those were all signals.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.200
 So is there, because you said reenergize,

13:51.200 --> 13:52.960
 is there, do you like to think,

13:52.960 --> 13:54.720
 and again, the human mind is complicated,

13:54.720 --> 13:57.040
 but do you like to think of it as like a bucket

13:57.040 --> 13:59.440
 that gets refilled for introverts

13:59.440 --> 14:03.520
 in terms of energy of social interaction

14:03.520 --> 14:06.800
 that they're able to handle?

14:07.440 --> 14:10.080
 Do you think of it like that as a bucket

14:10.080 --> 14:12.080
 that gets emptied and needs to be refilled?

14:12.080 --> 14:13.360
 I think of it, yeah, more or less,

14:13.360 --> 14:15.200
 because I use the metaphor of a battery

14:15.200 --> 14:16.720
 that gets recharged or not.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.960
 It's basically the same thing, different metaphor.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.200
 But yeah, but just to add on that,

14:21.840 --> 14:23.920
 there is a layer of complexity to that

14:23.920 --> 14:27.760
 because you could be somebody who

14:27.760 --> 14:30.960
 doesn't want the kind of social life, let's say,

14:30.960 --> 14:33.760
 where you have to be like on and presenting

14:33.760 --> 14:35.760
 and interacting with tons of people all the time,

14:35.760 --> 14:38.080
 but you'd get really lonely if you were just by yourself.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.880
 You know, so what you want is to maybe be in the company

14:40.880 --> 14:42.640
 of a couple of people you know really well.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.160
 Like for me, the pandemic was not actually that hard

14:46.160 --> 14:47.200
 for me personally.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.200
 I mean, I lost family, but I mean,

14:49.200 --> 14:51.200
 from the point of view of what we're talking about,

14:51.200 --> 14:54.000
 it wasn't that hard because I live with my husband

14:54.000 --> 14:55.200
 and my kids.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.560
 So I knew it was hard on the kids and I felt badly for them.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.880
 But for me, I was like, you know what,

15:00.880 --> 15:03.280
 I kind of, I have a lot of social life right here

15:03.280 --> 15:05.920
 in the house and I can focus and do my work.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.760
 Yeah, yeah.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.160
 That's the cool thing about the pandemic.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.520
 I think it helped people figure out

15:11.520 --> 15:13.120
 how much they love their family.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.160
 I think that's true.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.920
 And a lot of you give you a chance

15:15.920 --> 15:18.880
 to really reconnect with kids, with your kids,

15:18.880 --> 15:20.560
 like really spend time with them.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.760
 It's just fascinating to watch.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.440
 Like people actually, it did,

15:23.440 --> 15:28.160
 strengthen the family unit in an often beautiful way,

15:28.160 --> 15:32.160
 which just sucks to have to leave behind at this point.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.560
 Yeah, and I think that's part of what people are not

15:34.560 --> 15:37.840
 going to want to go back to that we need to solve for

15:37.840 --> 15:41.200
 to the extent that work becomes non remote again.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.000
 Yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.680
 I think people have just realized how precious

15:43.680 --> 15:45.040
 those aspects of their lives are.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.760
 And you know, for somebody who's in a sort of

15:47.760 --> 15:50.800
 conventional office job where you're going home

15:50.800 --> 15:53.840
 and seeing your kids for an hour before bedtime,

15:53.840 --> 15:55.760
 and that's your interaction with them,

15:55.760 --> 15:59.280
 that's kind of a ridiculous way to set things up.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.400
 Yeah, it's cool that you can get,

16:00.400 --> 16:02.720
 I think a lot of places give you the option now,

16:02.720 --> 16:03.600
 which is interesting.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.080
 You get to optimize that element of your life.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.840
 Do you take the commute and the office work

16:07.840 --> 16:09.040
 and then the social interaction there?

16:09.040 --> 16:11.520
 Or do you focus on the work at home?

16:11.520 --> 16:12.880
 It's also lonely at home,

16:12.880 --> 16:14.000
 but then you get to see your kids.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.960
 If you have kids, that's part of the optimization

16:16.960 --> 16:19.680
 is like I have some optimization.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.600
 I have some options now,

16:21.600 --> 16:23.600
 and I'm going to try to optimize

16:25.120 --> 16:30.240
 solitude, loneliness, happiness, productivity,

16:30.240 --> 16:34.800
 seeing family, seeing coworkers,

16:34.800 --> 16:36.720
 the chemistry with the team building with the coworkers

16:36.720 --> 16:40.320
 versus just the raw exchange of information

16:40.320 --> 16:41.280
 with the coworkers.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.600
 It's fascinating to see how that kind of evolves.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.480
 Yeah, and then there's the big, the third space idea

16:48.480 --> 16:52.560
 of the spaces where you're in a coworking space

16:52.560 --> 16:54.160
 or a cafe or something like that.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.600
 You've got other people around you,

16:55.600 --> 16:58.240
 but you're not exactly interacting with them,

16:58.240 --> 17:00.400
 but they're very much there.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.080
 And that's huge too.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.320
 I don't think we think about that enough.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.240
 Yeah, that energy is there.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.280
 Yeah, yeah.

17:07.280 --> 17:11.760
 I lived in Manhattan for 17 years before we had kids,

17:11.760 --> 17:15.440
 and I absolutely loved it.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.720
 I loved it, the feeling of all that energy all around you,

17:18.720 --> 17:21.040
 but you could be anonymous within it.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.160
 To me, it was perfect.

17:22.160 --> 17:22.800
 Yeah, it's beautiful.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.160
 Like I worked this morning for a few hours,

17:26.160 --> 17:28.400
 programmed for a few hours at a Starbucks.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.600
 And first of all, like wearing suits,

17:31.600 --> 17:34.800
 like Manhattan is the one place you can kind of fit into

17:34.800 --> 17:36.560
 because everyone's wearing suits.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.600
 Do you wear suits every day?

17:38.560 --> 17:39.760
 Well, these days, unfortunately,

17:39.760 --> 17:43.200
 because I get recognized, I wear usually not suits

17:43.200 --> 17:46.560
 when I'm just on my own life, but yeah, I love it.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.080
 I love the way it feels, I don't know.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.200
 And the way I think about the world when I wear a suit,

17:51.200 --> 17:54.400
 I take it seriously as if my life is going to end today.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.000
 Like this is what I would want to wear,

17:56.800 --> 17:58.560
 not for physical appearance,

17:58.560 --> 18:02.640
 but just for some reason it makes me feel like focused.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.200
 I don't know.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.960
 So even if you're not going to see anyone,

18:04.960 --> 18:06.960
 you would still put the suit on when you're doing your work?

18:06.960 --> 18:07.840
 Especially then.

18:07.840 --> 18:08.480
 Really?

18:08.480 --> 18:09.600
 Especially then, yeah.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.480
 Yeah, I really love doing that.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.800
 So it tells you seriousness of purpose,

18:14.800 --> 18:15.280
 something like that?

18:15.280 --> 18:16.080
 Yeah, yeah.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.600
 Like everything elevated now?

18:17.600 --> 18:18.480
 I don't know what it is.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.920
 I don't know what I imagine exactly,

18:19.920 --> 18:23.520
 but there's some kind of platonic form

18:23.520 --> 18:26.880
 of like a mixture of James Bond and like,

18:27.760 --> 18:28.880
 I don't know who else.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.040
 I wish a fine man would think about it

18:31.040 --> 18:32.320
 when I think about a suit.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.520
 I think of Leonard Cohen,

18:33.520 --> 18:36.880
 but he was always wearing suits, too, but you know.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.560
 Leonard Cohen is definitely one of my,

18:38.560 --> 18:41.120
 is a tragic human, is a beautiful human being.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.080
 Yeah, yeah.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.400
 Through his words, through his own private life.

18:44.400 --> 18:49.520
 Yes, I definitely would think about Leonard Cohen.

18:49.520 --> 18:53.520
 So small talk, that's another thing.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.240
 Is that part of the equation of introvert versus extrovert?

18:58.960 --> 19:00.960
 How much people enjoy small talk?

19:00.960 --> 19:04.720
 I kind of went into this whole thing thinking that it was,

19:04.720 --> 19:07.760
 but from what I've seen most people study

19:07.760 --> 19:09.600
 is that most people don't like small talk.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.720
 I think that's why people like your podcasts

19:12.720 --> 19:13.840
 because you're like,

19:13.840 --> 19:14.720
 get the small talk,

19:14.720 --> 19:17.360
 I'm going deep into it from the very beginning.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.560
 Yeah, so it's actually,

19:18.560 --> 19:21.520
 the picture you're painting is like the way you started,

19:21.520 --> 19:23.920
 like with your, with the book Quiet,

19:25.440 --> 19:26.880
 and the way you are today

19:26.880 --> 19:29.520
 is you realize the picture may be more complicated.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.160
 Yeah, everything's more complicated.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.600
 I will say with the small talk thing that

19:37.600 --> 19:39.760
 I'm curious if you have this experience,

19:39.760 --> 19:43.520
 but I find it fantastic to have a career

19:43.520 --> 19:49.040
 where I'm known for anti small talk kinds of topics

19:49.040 --> 19:51.200
 because it means that anywhere I go,

19:51.200 --> 19:53.600
 like if I show up at a conference or something like that,

19:53.600 --> 19:55.200
 no one does small talk with me.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.640
 They're like telling me about the deep truth of their lives

19:58.640 --> 20:01.600
 from the first hello, and I love that.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.320
 And in normal life, you have to like wade through a lot

20:04.320 --> 20:06.320
 before you know if people are ready to go there.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.760
 Yeah.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.800
 Do you have that experience too?

20:08.800 --> 20:11.760
 No, definitely, definitely with people that know me for sure.

20:11.760 --> 20:14.320
 But you forgot how many people feel like they know you

20:14.320 --> 20:15.920
 because of your podcasts?

20:15.920 --> 20:17.200
 Well, that's what, no, that counts.

20:17.200 --> 20:17.760
 Yeah.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.120
 Because I'm a huge fan of podcasts,

20:19.120 --> 20:23.600
 and I feel it like before I ever became friends with Joe Rogan,

20:23.600 --> 20:25.520
 I felt like I was friends with him

20:25.520 --> 20:27.280
 because I was a fan of his podcast.

20:27.280 --> 20:30.960
 And so like it was, I don't, I feel like it's a friendship.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.360
 I know it's a one way friendship with all the people

20:33.360 --> 20:34.960
 I listen to and podcast with.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.320
 And even people who are no longer with us, like writers,

20:38.320 --> 20:39.840
 I feel like I have a relationship with them.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.720
 Maybe I'm insane.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.480
 No, I totally feel that way.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.400
 That's the whole reason I became a writer.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.840
 Like I'm friends with Leonard Cohen.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.840
 Yeah.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.840
 And he's not aware of it.

20:49.840 --> 20:53.840
 No, I, but I think that's the whole reason

20:53.840 --> 20:56.960
 for writing or making music or whatever people do.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.320
 It's to be able to have those kinds of connections

21:00.320 --> 21:03.840
 that don't require how much you can do.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.160
 It doesn't require having to be in a room together

21:06.160 --> 21:07.760
 because there's only so many people

21:07.760 --> 21:10.960
 you can be in a room with in your lifetime.

21:10.960 --> 21:15.920
 The hard thing is, is unfortunately,

21:15.920 --> 21:19.600
 because I value human connection so much,

21:19.600 --> 21:22.000
 and I only have just like you mentioned,

21:22.000 --> 21:26.560
 sort of a small circle of people I'm really close with by design,

21:26.560 --> 21:30.240
 it always hurts me a lot to say goodbye to people.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.720
 Like you meet people and you can tell they're beautiful people.

21:32.720 --> 21:33.360
 They're amazing.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.360
 There's something so fascinating about them.

21:35.360 --> 21:40.080
 They're, they've had a complicated life,

21:40.080 --> 21:41.440
 like you could see in their eyes

21:41.440 --> 21:44.640
 in the way they tell their story in just a few sentences.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.840
 They've gone through some shit,

21:45.840 --> 21:48.960
 but they also found some elements of beauty.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.720
 And then you get to realize,

21:50.720 --> 21:52.880
 okay, well, there's a fascinating human here

21:52.880 --> 21:55.280
 and all you get to say is a few words here and there.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.560
 It was like a funny little joke,

21:58.560 --> 22:00.080
 maybe a dark joke here and there.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.480
 And then you just say goodbye, maybe hug it out.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.240
 And you go on your way.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.920
 So like that's a hello and a goodbye,

22:05.920 --> 22:07.360
 and your past will never cross again.

22:07.360 --> 22:12.080
 And that makes me like a sad walk away.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.720
 But I guess I wouldn't have it any other way,

22:14.720 --> 22:16.640
 I suppose, as the reality is.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.520
 In your book, you talk about that sorrow,

22:20.320 --> 22:22.320
 that sadness not being such a bad thing.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.280
 Yeah. And when you just said that,

22:25.840 --> 22:28.880
 I just thought of this one moment in my life

22:28.880 --> 22:32.400
 that I haven't thought of for 20, 30 years or something.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.080
 But it was when I was in law school

22:34.080 --> 22:38.800
 and a classmate of mine had his friend come to visit

22:38.800 --> 22:40.880
 for the weekend and the three of us hung out a lot

22:40.880 --> 22:43.760
 and we just had an amazing time.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.400
 And then this other guy,

22:46.400 --> 22:48.880
 who wasn't going to be coming back anytime soon, if at all,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.200
 sent a postcard to me.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.000
 And the only thing written on the postcard

22:54.000 --> 22:55.680
 was this quote from Oscar Wilde.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.040
 And I don't remember the exact words,

22:57.040 --> 23:00.240
 but it basically said that there's no pain as intense

23:00.240 --> 23:03.440
 as the sorrow of parting from someone

23:03.440 --> 23:04.800
 to whom you've just been introduced.

23:05.840 --> 23:06.640
 Yeah.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.320
 And there was something so intense about that.

23:09.120 --> 23:09.760
 And so true.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.440
 I think partly also,

23:11.440 --> 23:13.520
 because when you've just been introduced to somebody,

23:14.400 --> 23:18.320
 you don't yet know their difficulties.

23:18.320 --> 23:22.080
 So you're seeing the most sparkling version of them.

23:22.080 --> 23:26.400
 You're seeing like a platonic version of love and friendship.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.240
 And your imagination fills in the rest

23:28.240 --> 23:30.880
 in some beautiful way that matches perfectly

23:30.880 --> 23:32.800
 the kind of thing you're interested in.

23:32.800 --> 23:36.800
 That's how I feel about one spoon full of ice cream.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.040
 And that's why you always finished in a whole tub.

23:39.680 --> 23:40.960
 And you regret all of it.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.560
 You do say, what did you write this?

23:45.280 --> 23:46.800
 I think this is on your website

23:46.800 --> 23:48.400
 that one of the best things in the world

23:48.400 --> 23:52.000
 is that sublime moment when a writer, artist, or musician

23:52.000 --> 23:54.800
 manages to express something you've always felt,

23:54.800 --> 23:57.760
 but never articulated, or at least never quite so beautifully.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.120
 So that's the Oscar Wilde line is one line like that,

24:01.120 --> 24:06.560
 but just a line from a song or maybe a piece of art

24:06.560 --> 24:07.440
 that just grabs you.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.880
 Is there something that jumps out into memory like that for you?

24:11.600 --> 24:13.840
 I don't know if I have an exact line though.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.840
 I mean, that feeling that you just quoted

24:15.840 --> 24:17.280
 happens to me all the time.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.520
 I'm just bad at recalling exact instances.

24:19.520 --> 24:26.480
 But the writer Alain de Botton regularly makes me feel that way.

24:27.360 --> 24:31.760
 He's just this beautiful essayist and observer of human nature.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.520
 And he's just constantly expressing things

24:34.240 --> 24:37.440
 in this gorgeous way that you've experienced yourself.

24:37.440 --> 24:41.520
 And you feel like, it's just this grand act of generosity.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.880
 You feel less lonely.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.440
 You feel this deep sense of communion.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.120
 It's such an elevating experience.

24:47.120 --> 24:50.480
 Even when it's like a melancholy line.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.080
 Maybe especially when it is.

24:52.080 --> 24:52.800
 Yeah, what is that?

24:54.720 --> 24:55.280
 There's a...

24:56.720 --> 25:01.040
 So Jack Kerak on the road definitely makes me feel that way,

25:01.040 --> 25:02.480
 like every other line in there.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.600
 Forlorn rags of growing old.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.800
 You know, I never read that book.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.840
 So what was it about that book that made you feel that way?

25:10.880 --> 25:11.920
 Well, okay.

25:11.920 --> 25:17.520
 Well, and since you asked, I'm going to linger on this.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.520
 So this is stories.

25:19.520 --> 25:24.720
 He's kind of the book, the kind of defining book of the beats,

25:24.720 --> 25:25.760
 of the beat generation.

25:26.320 --> 25:30.560
 And it's basically a story of a writer who takes a road trip

25:31.440 --> 25:33.600
 across the United States a couple of times

25:34.480 --> 25:38.400
 and experiences a few close friends and a few strangers along the way.

25:38.400 --> 25:42.000
 And there's a lot of just those melancholy goodbyes along the way.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.720
 You meet all these people with interesting lives.

25:45.280 --> 25:46.800
 Some of them are defined by struggle.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.840
 Some of them are defined by drugs, drinking, women,

25:49.840 --> 25:50.800
 all that kind of stuff.

25:51.200 --> 25:54.400
 And still he just kind of dances around all of that.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.840
 And it's defined by the goodbyes and the passing of time.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.880
 So a lot of the really powerful lines are basically like...

26:02.640 --> 26:03.600
 There's one on there.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.680
 Again, I don't remember exactly, but he meets

26:05.680 --> 26:10.240
 a beautiful girl at rest stop.

26:10.880 --> 26:16.960
 And the girl is getting her or a woman is getting on a different bus

26:16.960 --> 26:17.840
 than he's getting on.

26:18.400 --> 26:26.320
 And so it's that feeling of falling in love for a second

26:26.960 --> 26:30.640
 and realizing that fate is just ripping that out.

26:30.640 --> 26:36.320
 Which is similar to this idea of it sucks to say goodbye just when you met,

26:36.320 --> 26:38.960
 but it's especially true when you fall in love just a little bit

26:38.960 --> 26:43.280
 with that stranger with all the possibilities that could lay there.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.440
 So there's a few lines of written down.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.920
 I went down this whole rabbit hole of thinking,

26:49.920 --> 26:51.360
 what are the lines that grabbed me?

26:52.320 --> 26:53.600
 A couple of lines from on the road.

26:53.600 --> 26:58.080
 So one is, what is that feeling when you're driving away from people

26:58.080 --> 27:01.760
 and they recede on the plane till you see their respects dispersing?

27:01.760 --> 27:05.120
 It's the two huge world vaulting us and it's goodbye,

27:05.120 --> 27:08.480
 but we'll lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.880
 So this is him talking about leaving a particular city.

27:11.520 --> 27:14.000
 The spoiler alert towards the end of the book,

27:14.640 --> 27:15.760
 rather the end of the book.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.760
 Line I return too often.

27:19.200 --> 27:22.720
 It's more poetry, but it's a feeling that captures the book, I would say.

27:22.720 --> 27:30.400
 The evening star must be drooping and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie,

27:30.400 --> 27:33.520
 which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth,

27:34.080 --> 27:38.160
 darkens all the rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final showroom.

27:38.720 --> 27:42.480
 And nobody, nobody knows what's going to happen to anybody

27:42.480 --> 27:44.800
 besides the forlorn rags of growing old.

27:46.320 --> 27:51.360
 And it just captures this kind of in the moment appreciation

27:51.360 --> 27:56.480
 of the beauty of the world and a sadness over the fact that time passes.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.400
 And you leave the people you love behind,

27:58.400 --> 28:02.560
 you leave the places you love behind, or at least the way they were

28:03.200 --> 28:04.640
 at the time that you really enjoyed them.

28:04.640 --> 28:08.560
 And you just leave that all that, just the sadness you feel when you,

28:08.560 --> 28:10.800
 something about it, like looking at a picture,

28:10.800 --> 28:14.240
 looking at your kids grow up, looking at old friends getting old,

28:15.040 --> 28:17.680
 something makes you realize that time passes.

28:17.680 --> 28:21.440
 And somewhere deep in there is probably a realization of your mortality.

28:21.440 --> 28:27.040
 And then it just makes you somehow first sad that everything comes to an end.

28:27.680 --> 28:34.400
 And then that's immediately followed by sort of an appreciation of the moment,

28:34.400 --> 28:36.960
 like a gratitude that you get to experience this moment.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.400
 Yeah, I know it exactly.

28:38.400 --> 28:42.480
 I mean, that's, that's the whole reason that I wrote Bitter Sweet, it's all about that.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.760
 So I know intensely what you're talking about.

28:45.760 --> 28:50.160
 And by the way, my husband loves the book, A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway,

28:50.160 --> 28:52.960
 which I also haven't read, but it talks about that same thing.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.680
 You know, groups of people traveling around together,

28:55.680 --> 28:59.120
 and the group coalesces into some magical formation,

28:59.120 --> 29:02.880
 and then one person leaves the group, and it's never going to be the same again,

29:02.880 --> 29:04.480
 and then they move on to the next one.

29:04.480 --> 29:11.040
 Yeah, I mean, I think that's the deepest essence of human nature.

29:11.040 --> 29:18.080
 The feeling of longing for some kind of state of perfect completeness, completion,

29:18.080 --> 29:20.720
 perfect love, the Garden of Eden, all of it.

29:21.440 --> 29:25.680
 And the feeling that you're never going to quite attain it,

29:25.680 --> 29:28.880
 but you get glimpses of it here and there, and that those glimpses

29:28.880 --> 29:31.120
 are some of the best things that ever happened to us.

29:31.120 --> 29:34.480
 And they're suffused with sadness because they're not the real thing,

29:34.480 --> 29:35.520
 or they're not the full thing.

29:35.520 --> 29:39.040
 They're just a glimpse, it's a glimpse of what we long for.

29:39.040 --> 29:42.080
 It's a glimpse of what we long for.

29:42.080 --> 29:48.720
 So the sadness that we might feel is always connected to the ways

29:48.720 --> 29:51.440
 in which we fall short from the perfect thing that we're...

29:52.080 --> 29:54.000
 Like, there's always the thing you're longing for,

29:55.760 --> 29:59.440
 and the sadness has to do with getting a glimpse of it,

29:59.440 --> 30:01.040
 but not quite getting a hold of it.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.960
 Yeah, yeah.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.640
 So it's always losing.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.120
 It's always losing, but it's also always that...

30:07.120 --> 30:10.640
 But it's not... That sounds really depressing, but it's not...

30:10.640 --> 30:13.040
 You know it's not depressing because you experience this all the time.

30:13.040 --> 30:18.240
 It's also... Those are the most beautiful moments, I think, life offers.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.280
 I mean, it's intense, intense beauty in those moments,

30:22.320 --> 30:25.600
 because it's getting closer to the real thing that we long for.

30:26.640 --> 30:30.480
 So what about, like, loss, losing love?

30:31.360 --> 30:35.920
 Is that also a beautiful thing?

30:35.920 --> 30:42.320
 Well, the moments you're talking about, I think it's easier to appreciate

30:42.320 --> 30:47.040
 the beauty of it all in the moment, because you're experiencing...

30:48.400 --> 30:51.840
 You're kind of experiencing the loss and the love all at the same time,

30:52.640 --> 30:54.960
 whereas if you're talking about straight up loss,

30:54.960 --> 31:00.240
 like a betrayal or a bereavement or whatever it is, that's...

31:01.280 --> 31:03.280
 It's different. It's quite overwhelming.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.520
 So losing loved one kind of thing.

31:05.520 --> 31:12.480
 Losing a loved one. I mean, I will say that the truth that I think that we can come to

31:12.480 --> 31:21.280
 after a lot of time on this earth is the idea that love exists not only in its particular forms,

31:21.280 --> 31:28.000
 so not only in the form of the one person, that one person we love or that other person we love,

31:28.000 --> 31:36.240
 but love itself is a state that we have access to, and so over time the loss of person A

31:36.240 --> 31:41.040
 can heal and you can tap into a kind of bigger river of love.

31:42.080 --> 31:48.960
 Yeah. I mean, I had this... It comes from Louis, Louis C.K. in a show. Damn, I love that line.

31:48.960 --> 31:56.320
 I mean, there's... He's talks to an older gentleman, and Louis is all, like,

31:56.320 --> 32:04.240
 is all sad about losing a loved one or getting rejected, essentially, like a breakup.

32:05.440 --> 32:09.120
 And then the older gentleman gives him advice saying...

32:11.360 --> 32:15.040
 Basically criticizes Louis for saying, why are you moping around?

32:15.040 --> 32:17.280
 Because this is the most... This is the best part.

32:17.840 --> 32:23.120
 Like losing love is the best part. The real loss is when you forget.

32:23.120 --> 32:27.920
 Like feeling shitty about having gone through a breakup

32:29.680 --> 32:34.080
 is when you most intensely appreciate what that person meant to you.

32:35.440 --> 32:42.480
 Like you most intensely feel love in some strange way by realizing that you've lost it,

32:42.480 --> 32:45.520
 by missing it, wishing... At this moment, I wish I had that.

32:46.480 --> 32:52.000
 Like that feeling, that's when you feel that love the most, the absence of it.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.880
 And so the older gentleman gives advice that that's the best part.

32:56.880 --> 32:59.840
 And if you're good with it, it can last for the longest.

33:01.280 --> 33:09.280
 It could be the most sort of prolonged experience of deep appreciation and emotion and so on.

33:09.280 --> 33:13.680
 So that's kind of a... That's a nice way to look at loss,

33:15.120 --> 33:18.480
 which is a reminder of how much somebody meant to us.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.840
 Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of truth in that.

33:23.520 --> 33:27.520
 Because, yeah, you wouldn't care so much if it weren't something that mattered to you.

33:27.520 --> 33:31.200
 So it's always a signpost to the direction you really want to go to.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.200
 That's always what it is.

33:34.640 --> 33:40.560
 Yeah, and it's interesting to see the way the mystical versions of

33:41.760 --> 33:45.360
 many of the great religions all point in this direction.

33:45.360 --> 33:50.320
 Whether you're looking at Sufism or the Kabbalah or in Christian mysticism,

33:50.320 --> 33:54.160
 you see this idea that the longing for what you lack

33:54.880 --> 33:58.240
 is the very thing that gives you what you're longing for.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.600
 So the longing is the cure.

33:59.600 --> 34:03.760
 I mean, that's the way the Sufi poet Rumi puts it, the longing is the cure.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.600
 He says, be thirsty, be as thirsty as you possibly can.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.120
 That's what you want to be.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.000
 The good stuff is the wanting, not the having.

34:12.000 --> 34:18.400
 Yeah, yeah, of course, tell it to a person I just broke up and they'll be like,

34:18.400 --> 34:19.120
 shut up, asshole.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.440
 Advice sucks.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.840
 I wish I had her and back.

34:24.640 --> 34:25.840
 Yeah, no, absolutely.

34:27.600 --> 34:31.440
 Those are the kinds of life lessons that only work when you kind of step away for a while.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.320
 They don't work in the moment of excruciation.

34:35.200 --> 34:41.920
 There is something about the fact of knowing that all humans are in that experience together

34:41.920 --> 34:45.280
 that is also incredibly uplifting.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.400
 Well, that takes time for people to realize.

34:49.520 --> 34:55.440
 Like, you know, like heartbreak in your early teenage years or something like that

34:55.440 --> 35:00.160
 could feel like this is completely the most novel and the most dramatic

35:01.920 --> 35:06.880
 pain that any human has ever felt, right, or maybe even when you're younger.

35:06.880 --> 35:12.240
 And then one of the things you realize is that everybody goes through this.

35:12.880 --> 35:16.320
 That can be an awakening to the fact that we're all in this together.

35:16.320 --> 35:19.520
 This human condition is not just a personal experience.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.440
 It's an experience we all share.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.960
 And that's a kind of love and the unity of it.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.440
 Yeah, that's a really deep kind of love.

35:27.440 --> 35:33.680
 And I feel like, you know, we're prevented from perceiving that love as,

35:33.680 --> 35:37.680
 it's actually like the most obvious kind of love and it's right there and it happens all the time.

35:37.680 --> 35:41.680
 But we're prevented from perceiving it because we're not really supposed to talk about things like that.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.160
 It's like, there's something unseemly about it.

35:44.160 --> 35:48.160
 Well, it's also in the West is this individualist society.

35:48.160 --> 35:54.880
 So, like, there's a pressure to sort of see the individual as a distinct sovereign entity

35:55.920 --> 36:02.320
 that experiences things and the unity between people is not obviously sort of

36:02.320 --> 36:05.520
 communicated or talked about or is part of the culture.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.520
 Yeah, it's not part of the culture.

36:07.520 --> 36:11.520
 And yet, you know, you see it in our behaviors because we're humans.

36:11.520 --> 36:14.320
 So, you know, why do people listen to sad music?

36:14.320 --> 36:18.320
 I mean, one reason is they're hearing expressed for them.

36:18.320 --> 36:23.520
 Like the musician is basically saying to them this thing that you have experienced.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.520
 I've experienced it too.

36:25.520 --> 36:29.360
 So have lots of other people and but they're saying it all without words and it's

36:29.360 --> 36:33.360
 transformed into something beautiful.

36:33.360 --> 36:37.360
 And there's something about that that's just incredibly elevating.

36:37.360 --> 36:43.360
 And people don't know it, but like there's one study that I have in Bittersweet that found that

36:43.360 --> 36:49.360
 people whose favorite songs are their happy songs play it on their playlists about 175 times.

36:49.360 --> 36:53.360
 The people who love sad music play them about 800 times.

36:53.360 --> 37:01.360
 And they say that they feel connected to the sublime when they're listening to that music.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.360
 What do you think that is?

37:03.360 --> 37:05.360
 So what is that?

37:05.360 --> 37:11.360
 What is it in music that connects us to the sublime through sadness?

37:11.360 --> 37:19.360
 I mean, I have a bunch of different theories like the whole reason I started writing this book

37:19.360 --> 37:23.360
 is because I kept having this reaction reliably to sad music.

37:23.360 --> 37:29.360
 And I realized that for people who I knew who are religious believers,

37:29.360 --> 37:35.360
 the way they describe their experience of God was what I was experiencing when I would hear that music.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.360
 Like all the time.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.360
 It happens over and over again.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.360
 So you wonder what that is?

37:41.360 --> 37:43.360
 Yeah.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.360
 So I started wondering what that is.

37:45.360 --> 37:51.360
 Lots of people have tried to figure out what that's all about.

37:51.360 --> 37:57.360
 And there are different theories that it's expressing, it's like a kind of catharsis for our difficult emotions

37:57.360 --> 38:03.360
 that it's, as we were saying, a sense of being in it together.

38:03.360 --> 38:09.360
 We don't react in that sort of uplifted way when you just see like a slideshow of sad faces,

38:09.360 --> 38:13.360
 which is something researchers have actually tested.

38:13.360 --> 38:17.360
 When they're seeing the slide to the sad faces, but the sad music, they're really reacting.

38:17.360 --> 38:21.360
 And also they don't really react when they're hearing music expressing other negative emotions,

38:21.360 --> 38:23.360
 like martial music or something like that.

38:23.360 --> 38:27.360
 It's just the sad music that gives people this elevated sense of wonder.

38:27.360 --> 38:33.360
 So I think it's the combination of the sadness and the beauty.

38:33.360 --> 38:38.360
 And I think it's just tapping into the essence of the human source code,

38:38.360 --> 38:42.360
 which is a kind of spiritual longing, whether we're atheists or believers.

38:42.360 --> 38:48.360
 There's this feeling of longing for a state and a place of perfect love

38:48.360 --> 38:51.360
 and perfect unity and perfect truth and all of it.

38:51.360 --> 38:55.360
 And like an acute awareness that we're not there in this world.

38:55.360 --> 39:02.360
 And in religions, we express that through the longing for Mecca or Eden or Zion.

39:02.360 --> 39:07.360
 And artistically, we express it with Dorothy longing for somewhere over the rainbow

39:07.360 --> 39:14.360
 or Harry Potter enters the story at the precise moment that he's become an orphan.

39:14.360 --> 39:19.360
 So he's now going to spend the rest of his life longing for these parents who he can never remember.

39:19.360 --> 39:24.360
 And that's, there's something about that state that's at our very core.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.360
 And I think that's why we love it so much.

39:26.360 --> 39:31.360
 Well, it could be, you know, you can have the Ernest Becker theory of denial of death

39:31.360 --> 39:38.360
 where at the core of that, the warm of the core, as Jung said, is the fear of death.

39:38.360 --> 39:46.360
 So where the longing for the perfect thing has to do with sort of becoming immortal

39:46.360 --> 39:56.360
 is reaching beyond the absurdity, the cruelty of life that all things come to an end

39:56.360 --> 40:03.360
 for no particularly good reason whatsoever, or one we can rationally explain.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.360
 I know, you know, I wonder about that all the time.

40:06.360 --> 40:11.360
 Like, I know obviously there's that idea from Becker and throughout philosophy

40:11.360 --> 40:16.360
 and the tale of Gilgamesh about the idea that the thing we're longing for most of all is immortality.

40:16.360 --> 40:20.360
 But I feel like it's not only that.

40:20.360 --> 40:30.360
 I think it's more so or also, let's say, a longing for the lions to lay down with the lambs finally,

40:30.360 --> 40:35.360
 you know, for like the fundamental calculus of the universe to just be different,

40:35.360 --> 40:38.360
 where life doesn't have to eat life in order to survive.

40:38.360 --> 40:45.360
 And yeah, just a completely different situation that immortality would not solve.

40:45.360 --> 40:52.360
 I wonder, that could be a very kind of modern thing,

40:52.360 --> 40:58.360
 because surely so much of human history is defined by violence and glorified violence

40:58.360 --> 41:03.360
 that doesn't give inklings of this lions and the lambs.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.360
 So much of...

41:06.360 --> 41:09.360
 I mean, I know all the other stuff is in the Bible too.

41:09.360 --> 41:10.360
 There's other stuff in the Bible.

41:10.360 --> 41:17.360
 And the Bible, that particular aspect doesn't necessarily reveal the fundamental motivation of human nature.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.360
 There could be deeper stuff, you know.

41:19.360 --> 41:23.360
 But yeah, that is a beautiful picture.

41:23.360 --> 41:28.360
 But is it just about humans or is it all about all of life?

41:28.360 --> 41:34.360
 And you have to think about what is the perfect world look like?

41:34.360 --> 41:37.360
 It's not just the lions and lambs laying together.

41:37.360 --> 41:41.360
 It's, you know, how many lions and how many lambs?

41:41.360 --> 41:42.360
 Right, right.

41:42.360 --> 41:49.360
 And, you know, what, having just had a few very technical conversations about Marxian economics

41:49.360 --> 41:53.360
 versus Kenzian economics versus Neoclassical economics.

41:53.360 --> 41:58.360
 What does the economic and the government system look like for the lions and the lambs that we're longing for?

41:58.360 --> 42:02.360
 So then you start to build society on top of all those things,

42:02.360 --> 42:07.360
 but you still, you return to this, what are we longing for?

42:07.360 --> 42:09.360
 And what's the role of love in that?

42:09.360 --> 42:14.360
 What's the role of that sad melancholy feeling, the feeling of loneliness?

42:14.360 --> 42:18.360
 Is the feeling of loneliness fundamental to the human condition?

42:18.360 --> 42:26.360
 Like, are we always striving to sort of channel that feeling of loneliness to connect with others?

42:26.360 --> 42:30.360
 Like, we want that feeling of loneliness, otherwise we wouldn't be connecting.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.360
 Is that fundamental?

42:32.360 --> 42:37.360
 That feeling like you're alone in this, even when you're with other people, sort of alone together.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.360
 You're born alone, you die alone.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.360
 Maybe loneliness is fundamental.

42:41.360 --> 42:44.360
 I think the longing for union is fundamental.

42:44.360 --> 42:47.360
 It's just that it looks so different for different people, you know.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.360
 Right?

42:48.360 --> 42:49.360
 Yeah.

42:49.360 --> 42:53.360
 And coming back to where we were, what we were talking about at the beginning, you know,

42:53.360 --> 42:58.360
 union looks incredibly social for a lot of people and hardly social at all for others,

42:58.360 --> 43:01.360
 but everybody needs some version of union.

43:01.360 --> 43:05.360
 Yeah, people have been telling me recently about polyamory and all those kinds of things.

43:05.360 --> 43:12.360
 Having probably grown up in a certain part of the world, I'm very, I think I'm very monogamy centric.

43:12.360 --> 43:14.360
 Not in a judgmental way, just for me.

43:14.360 --> 43:20.360
 What makes me happy is one person for my whole life, basically just dedication.

43:20.360 --> 43:21.360
 Yeah.

43:21.360 --> 43:27.360
 Because I've just seen through relationships with people and objects in my life,

43:27.360 --> 43:32.360
 the longer we stay together, the deeper the tie.

43:32.360 --> 43:36.360
 So that's just an empirical thing.

43:36.360 --> 43:40.360
 And yes, that probably is a personalized thing.

43:40.360 --> 43:41.360
 That's just true for me.

43:41.360 --> 43:43.360
 It could be very different for others.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.360
 Maybe it's connected to the introverted thing.

43:45.360 --> 43:49.360
 Maybe not.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.360
 Who knows?

43:50.360 --> 43:53.360
 Before I leave, because you mentioned songs, sad songs.

43:53.360 --> 43:55.360
 What are we talking about?

43:55.360 --> 43:59.360
 What song do you remember last crying to?

43:59.360 --> 44:00.360
 Oh, gosh.

44:00.360 --> 44:08.360
 Well, I mean, as you know, I literally dedicated my book to Leonard Cohen.

44:08.360 --> 44:10.360
 He's played such a huge role in my life.

44:10.360 --> 44:11.360
 I love him.

44:11.360 --> 44:13.360
 I love him.

44:13.360 --> 44:18.360
 I've loved him with this crazy love that I've never been able to understand for decades.

44:18.360 --> 44:21.360
 I think I understand it a little better now.

44:21.360 --> 44:24.360
 So you're better friends with him than me.

44:24.360 --> 44:30.360
 So does it make you, is it the musician or the human too?

44:30.360 --> 44:34.360
 Because the human is a tortuous soul in a way.

44:34.360 --> 44:36.360
 I'd say it's the musician.

44:36.360 --> 44:37.360
 It's the musician.

44:37.360 --> 44:38.360
 I actually was thinking about this the other day.

44:38.360 --> 44:43.360
 I mean, obviously he's not alive anymore, but I was kind of running the thought experiment.

44:43.360 --> 44:48.360
 You know, if he were alive still and I had the chance to meet him in person,

44:48.360 --> 44:50.360
 would I want to do that?

44:50.360 --> 45:00.360
 And I'm not really sure that I would because he represents for me symbolically everything.

45:00.360 --> 45:02.360
 Well, everything.

45:02.360 --> 45:04.360
 I'll end the sentence right there.

45:04.360 --> 45:06.360
 And so, and I think that's okay.

45:06.360 --> 45:11.360
 You know, I think people can express something through their art that they might or might

45:11.360 --> 45:15.360
 not express if you were just like hanging out with them and having a coffee.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.360
 And I'm happy to know him that way.

45:17.360 --> 45:23.360
 He can express himself, I'm sure, in the way that you know him as over coffee too.

45:23.360 --> 45:32.360
 It just requires like a focus of remembering of like a deep focus of connection.

45:32.360 --> 45:41.360
 That's why, like when I interact with folks, it's so draining for me because I'm putting

45:41.360 --> 45:48.360
 all my whatever weapons I got in terms of like deeply trying to understand the person in front of me

45:48.360 --> 45:56.360
 and doing that dance of human interaction, the humor, the intense kind of delving into who they are.

45:56.360 --> 46:05.360
 So, which requires like navigating around like small talk type of stuff and just like compliments and so on.

46:05.360 --> 46:11.360
 In general, like people, depending on the culture, depending on the place, they'll sometimes flower stuff with smiling

46:11.360 --> 46:13.360
 and like compliments like, oh, I love you.

46:13.360 --> 46:14.360
 This is great.

46:14.360 --> 46:20.360
 Like this, that's all great, but you want to get to the core of like, what are the demons in the closet?

46:20.360 --> 46:21.360
 Let's talk about it.

46:21.360 --> 46:24.360
 You know, and that could be exhausting.

46:24.360 --> 46:25.360
 That could be really exhausting.

46:25.360 --> 46:29.360
 So, from a Leonard Cole perspective, you get more and more famous.

46:29.360 --> 46:33.360
 It can be hard sometimes because he probably is also an introvert.

46:33.360 --> 46:39.360
 Oh, yeah, I know he was an introvert because he actually tweeted about my book when it came out.

46:39.360 --> 46:41.360
 So that was a precious moment for me.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.360
 Something that we should all be listening to the quiet.

46:43.360 --> 46:45.360
 I can't remember exactly what he said.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.360
 But yeah, yeah, no, he definitely was.

46:48.360 --> 46:56.360
 He struggled with depression, which I wonder if that's something that's also connected to introversion.

46:56.360 --> 47:02.360
 But perhaps not actually, perhaps that they're very disjoint and also connected to sensitivity and many sensitive people

47:02.360 --> 47:03.360
 or introverts.

47:03.360 --> 47:05.360
 So it's kind of like a Venn diagram.

47:05.360 --> 47:10.360
 It's about 80% of highly sensitive people are introverted, but then some are extroverts.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.360
 And then not all introverts are sensitive.

47:12.360 --> 47:16.360
 So it's complicated, but he was definitely a sensitive type.

47:16.360 --> 47:23.360
 Well, there's on top of that, you see like the percent of artists relative to the average that suffer from depression.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.360
 So creative people is very high.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.360
 It's crazy.

47:26.360 --> 47:27.360
 Yeah.

47:27.360 --> 47:31.360
 And then the number of artists and successful artists who were orphaned when they were young.

47:31.360 --> 47:33.360
 Who lost one parent or both parents.

47:33.360 --> 47:35.360
 It's like an astronomical number.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.360
 I have it in the book.

47:36.360 --> 47:38.360
 I don't remember the percentage, but huge.

47:38.360 --> 47:39.360
 And he was one of them.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.360
 He lost his father when he was nine.

47:42.360 --> 47:48.360
 And his first act of poetry was, his father made suits.

47:48.360 --> 47:51.360
 That's why I thought of him when we were talking about your suit.

47:51.360 --> 48:00.360
 And he took one of his father's bow ties and wrote a poem in his honor and buried the poem and the bow tie in the backyard.

48:00.360 --> 48:03.360
 And that was like his first creative act.

48:03.360 --> 48:06.360
 You know that song Chelsea with all number two?

48:06.360 --> 48:07.360
 Sure.

48:07.360 --> 48:09.360
 Where he met, I guess it's about Janice Joplin.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.360
 Janice Joplin.

48:10.360 --> 48:11.360
 Yeah.

48:11.360 --> 48:17.360
 What a fun, intense and cruel person she is.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.360
 Yeah.

48:18.360 --> 48:21.360
 So I guess.

48:21.360 --> 48:28.360
 Have you ever seen, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but have you ever seen his son Adam Kohn and Lana Del Ray perform that song together?

48:28.360 --> 48:29.360
 Oh, wow.

48:29.360 --> 48:30.360
 Oh, no.

48:30.360 --> 48:31.360
 It's incredible.

48:31.360 --> 48:32.360
 I have to send it to you.

48:32.360 --> 48:33.360
 Yeah.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.360
 So that for people who don't know, I don't, I mean, maybe I don't know.

48:36.360 --> 48:39.360
 It goes, I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel.

48:39.360 --> 48:42.360
 You're talking so brave and so sweet.

48:42.360 --> 48:48.360
 Giving me head on the unmade bed while the limousines wait in the street.

48:48.360 --> 48:53.360
 There's a good line in there about being ugly.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.360
 Oh yeah.

48:54.360 --> 48:56.360
 We are ugly, but we have the music.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.360
 No.

48:57.360 --> 48:59.360
 Yeah, from a guy's perspective, it was.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.360
 Okay.

49:00.360 --> 49:05.360
 Oh, you told me again, you preferred handsome men, but for me, you would make an exception.

49:05.360 --> 49:06.360
 Yeah.

49:06.360 --> 49:07.360
 So good.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.360
 So good.

49:08.360 --> 49:13.360
 Well, she continued that thread in later because I think she said that he was lousy in bed.

49:13.360 --> 49:14.360
 Oh, was that right?

49:14.360 --> 49:15.360
 Yeah.

49:15.360 --> 49:22.360
 She publicly said that, which is like, oh man, did there, just, okay, for people who don't

49:22.360 --> 49:28.360
 know, I think this is a true story about them interacting and being together for a very

49:28.360 --> 49:29.360
 brief time.

49:29.360 --> 49:34.360
 I don't know, dating, but just connecting, falling in love or in this only, in this very

49:34.360 --> 49:40.360
 particular way that I think famous musicians, poets can, can, which is like, it's impossible

49:40.360 --> 49:42.360
 for that kind of thing to last.

49:42.360 --> 49:46.360
 But they, they did for a brief moment.

49:46.360 --> 49:51.360
 There's like a sadness to it because it's so momentarily.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.360
 But it's so epic.

49:53.360 --> 49:54.360
 Yeah.

49:54.360 --> 49:58.360
 And that these two paths cross and then you just look at the, we know these famous people

49:58.360 --> 50:00.960
 and it's, it's, it's interesting to watch.

50:00.960 --> 50:01.960
 Yeah.

50:01.960 --> 50:04.440
 And you don't even have the impression that they're thinking it's going to last.

50:04.440 --> 50:08.840
 They more know that it's like a blaze of an intersection and the, you know, the limousine's

50:08.840 --> 50:11.600
 already waiting while they're in the moment, in the middle of it.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.360
 And then it's done.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.360
 Yeah.

50:14.360 --> 50:21.200
 But he's talked about how his music, he said, he said something like, some people

50:21.200 --> 50:26.200
 are more inclined to say hello with their music, but I'm rather more valedictory.

50:26.200 --> 50:27.200
 That's what he said.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.200
 What is valedictory?

50:28.200 --> 50:32.200
 Like saying goodbye, like the valedictorian's address.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.200
 Interesting.

50:33.200 --> 50:41.200
 You know, so many of his songs really are about some form of parting or goodbye or an imperfection

50:41.200 --> 50:43.200
 or something, or like the broken hallelujah.

50:43.200 --> 50:44.200
 Yeah.

50:44.200 --> 50:54.700
 But the thing that's so incredible about him is, is the way that he's taking all of that

50:54.700 --> 50:57.200
 and pointing it in the direction of transcendence.

50:57.200 --> 51:01.000
 Like it's not, it's not just pure sadness.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.400
 It's sadness and beauty.

51:02.400 --> 51:03.400
 And that's the thing.

51:03.400 --> 51:04.400
 Yeah.

51:04.400 --> 51:07.840
 There is a feeling of transcendence in a lot of the songs.

51:07.840 --> 51:10.680
 It's like sadness and transcendence, you're right.

51:10.680 --> 51:17.280
 It's a goodbye, but you're moving on to some bigger thing.

51:17.280 --> 51:23.400
 But in a sort of ethereal way, like not like a proud, arrogant way.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.400
 Yeah.

51:24.400 --> 51:28.080
 So his favorite poet was Garcia Lorca.

51:28.080 --> 51:30.080
 He actually named his daughter after him.

51:30.080 --> 51:31.760
 His daughter's name is Lorca.

51:31.760 --> 51:41.760
 And he talks about how there's some poem that Lorca had written that made him realize that

51:41.760 --> 51:46.800
 the universe itself was aching, but the ache was okay because that's the way you embrace

51:46.800 --> 51:50.000
 the sun and the moon.

51:50.000 --> 51:58.480
 And that's what I think is, that's why I think there's this whole rich vein in this bittersweet

51:58.480 --> 52:02.360
 tradition that he embodies that's like the essence of beauty.

52:02.360 --> 52:05.280
 It's the way you embrace the sun and the moon.

52:05.280 --> 52:12.880
 The song, Hallelujah, I return to that often have been me to play it, I have now a friend

52:12.880 --> 52:14.520
 who wants to sing it with me.

52:14.520 --> 52:17.280
 Are you a singer?

52:17.280 --> 52:25.240
 When somebody says they're a singer, do they have to be good?

52:25.240 --> 52:26.240
 Because then no.

52:26.240 --> 52:30.920
 But I would say yes, I was in a band for a while, I sang for a while, I was always bad,

52:30.920 --> 52:33.920
 but I enjoy it.

52:33.920 --> 52:34.920
 I enjoy it.

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
 I enjoy lyrics.

52:35.920 --> 52:36.920
 I enjoy words.

52:36.920 --> 52:37.920
 Yeah.

52:37.920 --> 52:40.720
 When sung or spoken, they capture something.

52:40.720 --> 52:47.080
 Like again, that moment, Tom Waits is a huge favorite of mine for that reason, although

52:47.080 --> 52:52.560
 he often, his lyrics are often not that simple.

52:52.560 --> 52:56.680
 I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy.

52:56.680 --> 53:03.800
 He's always playing with just like these weird word play that's especially in the English

53:03.800 --> 53:06.240
 language is trickier to do.

53:06.240 --> 53:10.720
 I'm fortunate enough to know another language, which is Russian, so I get to understand that

53:10.720 --> 53:16.080
 certain languages allow for more word play than others.

53:16.080 --> 53:23.880
 At least for that reason, I don't think has a culture of, you know what, I need to push

53:23.880 --> 53:31.680
 back on what I'm about to say, but there was no culture of word play until hip hop came

53:31.680 --> 53:32.680
 along.

53:32.680 --> 53:41.160
 So like distorting words in interesting ways for there to be a rhythm, a rhyme, and at

53:41.160 --> 53:47.480
 the same time, you're capturing some really powerful message plus humor, all of that mixed

53:47.480 --> 53:48.480
 in.

53:48.480 --> 53:51.080
 Actually, hip hop does a really good job of this, but there wasn't a tradition.

53:51.080 --> 53:54.800
 If you look at poetry in the 20th century, there wasn't really a tradition of that in

53:54.800 --> 54:00.040
 the United States, but there was in other parts of the world, in certain in Russia.

54:00.040 --> 54:01.040
 Interesting.

54:01.040 --> 54:03.880
 Empowered also, not just by the language, by the fact that you go through a world war

54:03.880 --> 54:10.360
 where tens of millions of people die, something about mass death of civilians that inspires

54:10.360 --> 54:12.480
 great literature and music and art.

54:12.480 --> 54:16.480
 Yeah, absolutely, because you start telling the real truth, I think.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.480
 Yes.

54:17.480 --> 54:21.760
 There's no more reason for small talk.

54:21.760 --> 54:22.760
 That's funny.

54:22.760 --> 54:27.560
 I always have thought that if I could choose any other medium besides writing, it would

54:27.560 --> 54:28.560
 be singing.

54:28.560 --> 54:30.560
 Are you a singer?

54:30.560 --> 54:31.560
 No.

54:31.560 --> 54:32.560
 I mean, like I'm really not.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.600
 I just love the idea of it.

54:34.600 --> 54:38.120
 But then I also think, you know, I'm fundamentally a shy person, so I think it's much better

54:38.120 --> 54:42.760
 that my medium is writing instead of singing, so it all worked out.

54:42.760 --> 54:49.040
 That said, you're also an exceptionally good public speaker, and you're not supposed to

54:49.040 --> 54:51.920
 be mathematically speaking.

54:51.920 --> 54:52.920
 Mathematically speaking.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.520
 You're not supposed to be a good public speaker.

54:54.520 --> 54:56.200
 Oh, you mean because of shyness?

54:56.200 --> 54:59.840
 Yeah, because of shyness, because of introversion, because of all those kinds of things.

54:59.840 --> 55:00.840
 Oh, yeah.

55:00.840 --> 55:03.400
 But lots of introverts are public speakers, actually.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.400
 This is one of...

55:04.400 --> 55:08.840
 I knew this from the studies, but then also when I started going out on the lecture circuit,

55:08.840 --> 55:12.640
 I realized that all my fellow speakers at all these conferences I was going to, they're

55:12.640 --> 55:17.960
 all introverts because, you know, they're all people who spent years figuring out some

55:17.960 --> 55:19.960
 idea and now they're out there talking about it.

55:19.960 --> 55:22.120
 Oh, they're in their head figuring out the idea.

55:22.120 --> 55:23.120
 Yeah.

55:23.120 --> 55:28.320
 How do you explain that the public speakers, would you say the good public speakers are

55:28.320 --> 55:29.560
 usually introverts?

55:29.560 --> 55:32.240
 No, I think there's just different styles of it.

55:32.240 --> 55:34.640
 And I think that we just have...

55:34.640 --> 55:39.760
 When we hear the word public speaker, we have a really limited idea of who that person would

55:39.760 --> 55:40.760
 be.

55:40.760 --> 55:46.000
 So, for me, I used to be very phobic about public speaking, and part of the reason for

55:46.000 --> 55:52.680
 it was because I thought that being the kind of person I was didn't equal being able to

55:52.680 --> 55:57.800
 be a good public speaker, because you're only imagining, you know, like the super kind of

55:57.800 --> 56:00.360
 out there showman.

56:00.360 --> 56:05.480
 But I think there's another style of public speaking that's more reflective and thoughtful

56:05.480 --> 56:08.480
 and conveying ideas and people like that, too.

56:08.480 --> 56:10.960
 Is there advice you can give on how to overcome that?

56:10.960 --> 56:15.080
 Like if you're a shy person, how to be a public speaker?

56:15.080 --> 56:20.440
 I can totally give that advice because I used to, before I would give a speech, is, you

56:20.440 --> 56:24.360
 know, if I had to do it in law school, if I knew like today was the day when I was going

56:24.360 --> 56:29.080
 to get called on in a law school class, I literally one time vomited on my way to class.

56:29.080 --> 56:33.160
 Like, that's how nervous I used to be.

56:33.160 --> 56:38.360
 And yeah, the way to do it is through desensitization, you know, it's like been figured out.

56:38.360 --> 56:39.920
 It's the way to overcome any fear.

56:39.920 --> 56:45.360
 You have to expose yourself to the thing you fear, but in very small doses.

56:45.360 --> 56:48.080
 So you can't start by giving the TED Talk.

56:48.080 --> 56:49.080
 You have to start.

56:49.080 --> 56:53.880
 I started by going to this class for people with public speaking anxiety, where on the

56:53.880 --> 56:59.800
 first day, all we had to do was stand up and say our name and sit down and like that's

56:59.800 --> 57:01.440
 the victory.

57:01.440 --> 57:06.720
 That's fun to watch all those people with anxiety, just okay, that's the first step

57:06.720 --> 57:08.680
 in the step, one step at a time.

57:08.680 --> 57:09.680
 Yeah.

57:09.680 --> 57:13.880
 And then like with this class, you go back the next week and, and he would have us come

57:13.880 --> 57:19.680
 to the front of the room and stand up with other people standing next to us so that you

57:19.680 --> 57:23.400
 didn't have the feeling of being all alone in the spotlight through others sharing it

57:23.400 --> 57:24.520
 with you.

57:24.520 --> 57:27.720
 And you would answer some questions about where do you grow up, you know, where do you

57:27.720 --> 57:31.680
 go to school and you declare victory and you're done.

57:31.680 --> 57:35.960
 And then little by little by little, you keep ratcheting up the exercises until you get

57:35.960 --> 57:38.000
 to the point where you can do it.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.680
 And then you start having successes and you realize, oh, you know, actually I can do this.

57:43.680 --> 57:49.200
 What about like writing versus improvising because I knew a few people, sort of the colleagues

57:49.200 --> 57:54.920
 of mine that were working on TED Talks and it feels like you're supposed to like write

57:54.920 --> 57:59.320
 the thing like way ahead of time and you practice it and they, they help you and all that kind

57:59.320 --> 58:00.320
 of stuff.

58:00.320 --> 58:05.000
 I don't think I've ever practiced the speech once in my life or lecture or any of that.

58:05.000 --> 58:10.760
 Like I know it's really good to do, but is, do you find that relief, some of your anxiety

58:10.760 --> 58:15.840
 preparing well or are you now able to do not preparing well at all?

58:15.840 --> 58:22.560
 I definitely like to prepare before, but the kind of preparation that I've done for my

58:22.560 --> 58:26.360
 TED Talks is completely different from what I've done for everything else.

58:26.360 --> 58:31.560
 Cause TED Talks are more like a theatrical event where it's like a one person show.

58:31.560 --> 58:35.440
 And of course, if you were going to go on Broadway with a monologue, you would know

58:35.440 --> 58:36.440
 every word.

58:36.440 --> 58:38.320
 So it's kind of like that.

58:38.320 --> 58:41.360
 And so I would rehearse it over and over the way you do that.

58:41.360 --> 58:45.040
 Isn't that more anxiety, knowing every single word?

58:45.040 --> 58:48.680
 It's so much anxiety because yeah, you're, you're not even so freaked out about being

58:48.680 --> 58:51.280
 on stage so much as what if I forget something?

58:51.280 --> 58:52.280
 Yeah.

58:52.280 --> 58:53.280
 Yeah.

58:53.280 --> 58:54.280
 Absolutely.

58:54.280 --> 58:58.200
 I mean, they do things like the last TED Talk I gave, I actually did forget something

58:58.200 --> 58:59.200
 halfway through.

58:59.200 --> 59:01.160
 Like I just couldn't remember the next line.

59:01.160 --> 59:08.640
 Um, and so I had to walk over, like over there where my notes and so I did that and the audience

59:08.640 --> 59:14.400
 like very kindly clapped and then I came back to the spotlight and kept going and they edit

59:14.400 --> 59:15.400
 that out.

59:15.400 --> 59:16.400
 Nice.

59:16.400 --> 59:17.400
 So there's a family remote.

59:17.400 --> 59:18.400
 It's okay.

59:18.400 --> 59:22.040
 But still, it seems really, it seems really stressful.

59:22.040 --> 59:29.320
 Like I, I'm now, I'm not sure if I'll ever publish it, but I've been, mostly it's for

59:29.320 --> 59:36.480
 personal journey, but I've been working on a series on, wait for it, Hitler and the Third

59:36.480 --> 59:41.960
 Reich sort of looking at the historical context of everything because of my family was so

59:41.960 --> 59:44.560
 much affected by that whole part of history.

59:44.560 --> 59:51.000
 So for me to rigorously, I've read a lot about Stalin and Hitler and for me to force

59:51.000 --> 59:56.160
 myself, one of the best ways to force yourself to really consider material is to have to

59:56.160 --> 59:57.160
 talk about it.

59:57.160 --> 59:58.160
 Totally.

59:58.160 --> 59:59.160
 Yeah.

59:59.160 --> 1:00:00.160
 And so that's, that's why I'm doing it.

1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:08.760
 But I'm playing with ideas of some of it, maybe like 20% is written down on paper, but

1:00:08.760 --> 1:00:12.360
 the rest of it is my thoughts in the moment.

1:00:12.360 --> 1:00:17.040
 That's a difficult balance to strike because if you write a lot, you're going to be more

1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:18.040
 precise.

1:00:18.040 --> 1:00:23.880
 You're going to be more accurate, but you're going to miss some of the deep, like honest

1:00:23.880 --> 1:00:25.480
 emotion.

1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:35.440
 The silences won't be correct or the silences between the words won't capture the depth

1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:36.440
 of feeling.

1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:41.360
 Unless, if you're somebody like me, if you're like, I guess that's what actors and actresses

1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:48.640
 have to do, like basically, even though the script is fully written, you improvise between

1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:50.320
 the word between the lines.

1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:51.320
 Yeah.

1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:52.320
 But that's a scale.

1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:54.640
 Well, it also takes so much time.

1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:57.320
 I mean, I experienced that with the TED Talks.

1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:02.040
 It's like, you get to a stage, so you're memorizing everything word for word.

1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:07.120
 And at first, in that process, it comes out in a really wooden way, the way you're saying,

1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:08.720
 like the emotion's gone.

1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:13.720
 But once you really know it, so you've internalized the words, then all the emotion comes back

1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:15.640
 and you can say them in a completely different way.

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:20.640
 And you're really speaking it from the heart, but you have to know it so well before you

1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:21.640
 can do that.

1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:25.600
 I would never recommend it because it's just like, it's so time consuming.

1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:26.600
 It's an inch.

1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:28.480
 Well, in your case, it works out beautiful.

1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:36.920
 But when it all comes together, it is a theatrical thing, it's like a musical or whatever.

1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:42.720
 I think I'm going to come out with a one man show on Broadway singing now.

1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:43.720
 I'm inspired.

1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:47.720
 No, but for real, where are you going to talk about Hitler and Stallone and everything

1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:48.720
 you're learning?

1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:49.720
 Me too.

1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:55.960
 Have you ever thought of using the medium of just speaking into a microphone but without

1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:57.840
 the video?

1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:03.400
 I'm curious about this because like I fell in love with podcasts originally before there

1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:06.000
 was ever this whole video component to it.

1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.960
 And I realized there's something so primal and magical about having someone's voice in

1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:11.960
 your ear.

1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:12.960
 Oh, yeah.

1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:16.680
 And my favorite kinds of interviews still, very few people do it this way nowadays, but

1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:21.080
 my favorite kind are when you're just talking into the microphone.

1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:25.880
 So it's not over Zoom, it's not in person, it's just you in the microphone and the other

1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:28.440
 person in the microphone and they're in your ear.

1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:30.080
 It's like the ultimate in intimacy.

1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:33.520
 Oh, you mean from the interviewer perspective, that's your favorite.

1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:38.280
 Yeah, but it would be interesting also with the kind of thing you're talking about of

1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:40.600
 just speaking, like just you and the mic.

1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:43.400
 I would love to be in person, but you can't see the person.

1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:44.400
 I wonder what that's like.

1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:47.040
 It would mean like they're all there but behind a curtain?

1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:48.520
 No, you just have your eyes closed.

1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:52.280
 You're just talking, you have your eyes closed or whatever.

1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:55.880
 Because I think you still have to get the same kind of chemistry because it's not just

1:02:55.880 --> 1:02:56.880
 the visuals.

1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:01.360
 I don't even know that because obviously I have trouble making eye contact.

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:04.840
 But I don't know if the visual stimulation is the necessary thing.

1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:09.640
 There's something about the way audio travels that captures the intimacy where some people

1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:15.160
 actually have headphones on, like Joe does this, have headphones on, that's really intimate.

1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:18.320
 Like there's something about that sound going directly into your ear.

1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:19.320
 Exactly.

1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:20.320
 Yeah.

1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:21.320
 Yeah, there is something primal there.

1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:28.600
 I've thought about it definitely as some of my favorite podcasts are like that, WTF

1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:31.720
 with Mark Maron, that's audio only.

1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:34.880
 There's a few audio only podcasts that I just love.

1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:35.880
 What is that?

1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:42.160
 I still go on Clubhouse that that was a social media platform where it's audio only and it's

1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:46.760
 so interesting that people, the interesting thing about Clubhouse in particular is people

1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:53.000
 from all walks of life can tune in and they just have, it's something you need to do some

1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:00.720
 research in terms of introversion on that one because I don't feel any of my introvert

1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:08.280
 like triggers happening because so nobody can see you is just audio and nobody is offended

1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:14.480
 if you're just sitting there quietly, just listening so you can participate whenever

1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:15.720
 you want or not.

1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:17.840
 Yeah, it's like the ultimate social freedom.

1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:18.840
 Yeah.

1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:19.840
 You can listen as much as you'd like.

1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:22.000
 You can participate if you want, but you don't have to.

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:23.000
 It's no big deal.

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000
 Yeah.

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000
 Yeah.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.120
 If I'm actually at a physical party, somebody's going to look at me and be like, why, you

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:33.840
 know, there'll be that pressure to speak, but you don't have to in that kind of audio

1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:36.240
 setting and there's that intimacy.

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:40.520
 Like you can, when it's audio only, it feels like you can reveal a lot more of yourself

1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:43.400
 in some kind of honest way.

1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:44.840
 I don't know what that is.

1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:45.840
 What is that?

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:46.840
 What is that?

1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:50.120
 I don't know, but I assume it's tapping into something really ancient.

1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:52.080
 We used to tell stories around the fire.

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:55.920
 Our whole storytelling tradition was oral originally.

1:04:55.920 --> 1:05:00.080
 So maybe it's that, but we used visual stuff, like...

1:05:00.080 --> 1:05:01.080
 That's true.

1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:02.080
 You could actually see the person.

1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:10.240
 It seems like the visual element is so fundamental to the social interaction, but there is something

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:11.800
 primal about audio.

1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:12.800
 I wonder what that is.

1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:17.440
 Still, that's why, I mean, most people listen to podcasts, I think, audio only.

1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:19.520
 They have it in their ears while they're doing stuff.

1:05:19.520 --> 1:05:20.520
 Yeah.

1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:21.520
 That's how I do it.

1:05:21.520 --> 1:05:22.520
 And then there's...

1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:23.520
 Yeah, that's how I do it too.

1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:26.840
 And that's where the friendship is formed.

1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:27.840
 It's weird.

1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:35.160
 The deep connection with other humans is formed because they're in your ear and you get to

1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:36.160
 see them grow.

1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:41.200
 You get to see them be bored, experienced, excitement and anger and fear and all those

1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:43.520
 kinds of things.

1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:45.280
 It's fascinating.

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:51.440
 The world of podcasting is fascinating because we're in this world of essentially radio,

1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:58.200
 even though we all have all this high definition content, all this TikTok style, fast stuff

1:05:58.200 --> 1:05:59.200
 and still podcasting.

1:05:59.200 --> 1:06:01.000
 I know and we still choose to do this.

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:02.000
 It's weird.

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:03.000
 It's at the end of the day.

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:06.720
 I think that's really what people want most is just to talk to each other and to know what

1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:08.000
 people really think.

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:12.480
 And podcasting of all the media that I've ever seen is the one where people come closest

1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:19.000
 to telling you the truth and to telling you the good and the bad and the bitter and the

1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:20.000
 sweet and all of it.

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.000
 Especially long form.

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.000
 There's not enough time.

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.000
 Yeah, exactly.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.160
 I had to explain this to people.

1:06:25.160 --> 1:06:32.080
 You talk to CEOs and stuff, they're starting to understand much better.

1:06:32.080 --> 1:06:37.200
 Now as a hard requirement with CEOs and stuff, it has to be three hours.

1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:45.600
 I say like this because there's something, they can't be doing marketing stuff for three

1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:46.600
 hours.

1:06:46.600 --> 1:06:47.600
 They break.

1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:48.600
 They start being human.

1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:49.600
 They start joking.

1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:50.600
 They start relaxing.

1:06:50.600 --> 1:06:54.840
 And if they can't, that also tells the kind of story, but I do that kind of torture for

1:06:54.840 --> 1:06:55.840
 CEOs only.

1:06:55.840 --> 1:06:56.840
 Anyway.

1:06:56.840 --> 1:07:02.000
 Yeah, when I was getting, my publishing house did media training with me before Bitter

1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:09.560
 Sweet came out and they were preparing me for like the five to seven minute interview

1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:10.560
 that you might have.

1:07:10.560 --> 1:07:15.920
 If you go on some quick TV thing or something like that, and God, I hate that.

1:07:15.920 --> 1:07:22.400
 It feels like you're basically having to not tell the full truth somehow because you can't

1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:24.720
 tell it in such a short amount of time.

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:25.720
 Well the other...

1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:28.400
 So to me, podcasting is just the best thing that's ever happened.

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:34.760
 The other downside of the seven minute interview is I think you could do a really good job

1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:37.960
 with that, but the dance partner has to be very good.

1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:39.960
 It's actually challenging for everybody involved.

1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:46.600
 It's much harder for everybody involved because if you can do, I can imagine like a Christopher

1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:52.960
 Hitchens type character who's just super witty, then that you could do a seven minute thing.

1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:55.360
 You can get to the core of Bitter Sweet.

1:07:55.360 --> 1:07:59.360
 You can get to the core of the book without asking those generic small talk questions because

1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:05.840
 too many people in that short form interview are just asking very generic questions.

1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:07.960
 They're doing small talk for seven minutes.

1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:13.640
 It's like, all right, you only get seven minutes, you only get one interesting question.

1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:21.720
 Go ask the weirdest, the deepest question that also energizes the other person.

1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:27.880
 It's an art form that people don't take seriously, I think seven minute thing, five minute or

1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:31.280
 even less, and then the commercials, which I...

1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:38.600
 Yeah, and I've noticed that many of the best podcasters are ones where when you're on my

1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:43.600
 side of the table, you feel like it's more of a conversation and less like an interview

1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:47.440
 where you're answering all the same questions you've answered a million times before.

1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:51.120
 It's really interesting how different the experience is.

1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:57.960
 When you write the audio thing, if you can lose yourself in that, the intimacy of that,

1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:03.840
 and you don't even remember what stupid stuff you said, because people don't give them enough

1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:07.280
 credit as...

1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:12.480
 You might not be aware, might not be a fan, but Joe Rogan is an incredible conversationalist

1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:20.640
 in that he makes you forget that anything's being recorded, that you're talking it all.

1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:29.280
 He makes you forget time, and you just enjoy yourself, and that's whatever that is.

1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:34.680
 Then you plug into that primal connection to other humans.

1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:36.480
 What's your favorite Leonard Cohen song?

1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:37.480
 Famous Blue Raincoat.

1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:38.480
 Do you know that one?

1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:39.480
 Yeah.

1:09:39.480 --> 1:09:40.480
 Maybe I'll play it.

1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:41.480
 Yeah.

1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:45.920
 For people who don't know Leonard Cohen, and this is your first introduction to him,

1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:49.640
 it's going to sound so gloomy, but it's so good.

1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:55.120
 He's got this deep, rich voice, Tori Amos covering Famous Blue Raincoat.

1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:56.120
 Yeah.

1:09:56.120 --> 1:09:57.120
 No.

1:09:57.120 --> 1:09:58.840
 We want the original.

1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:02.280
 Just like Hallelui, Jeff Buckley covered Leonard Cohen.

1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:03.280
 That was a really good one.

1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:04.280
 That was a really good one.

1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:05.280
 Yeah.

1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:09.800
 I also really like Rufus Wainwright's cover, but Famous Blue Raincoat, for people who don't

1:10:09.800 --> 1:10:17.000
 know it, it's basically about a love triangle, and it's told from the perspective of a man

1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:24.640
 whose wife has just been with another guy who is also his friend, and he's writing a

1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:29.840
 letter to that other guy, and he's reflecting on the way that all the relationships have

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:33.800
 changed in the wake of this event.

1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:36.120
 So they're still friends.

1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:42.240
 Well, he refers to him as my brother, my killer, which is such a Leonard Cohen thing to do,

1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:48.920
 because it's always like, you know, it's light and it's dark all at once.

1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:53.920
 Nothing is ever all one thing.

1:10:53.920 --> 1:11:01.920
 Yeah, I love this song.

1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:02.920
 Yeah, right?

1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:25.280
 I mean, he just speaks of it, and the fact that it's four in the morning, and it's the

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:31.960
 end of December, like those are transitional moments, you know, it's night going into day,

1:11:31.960 --> 1:11:39.840
 and it's December going into the new year, that's not an accident.

1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:43.960
 There is something about December, whatever, there's certain scenes you can paint in your

1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:44.960
 mind.

1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:52.520
 There's a poem by Charles Bocoski called Nirvana, it's a young man traveling through

1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:54.680
 the middle of nowhere in the snow.

1:11:54.680 --> 1:11:59.080
 There's something about the snow, either the rain or the snow can put you in a certain

1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:06.360
 kind of mood, they're just, what is it, James Joyce, the dead, the snow is falling, a Dublin,

1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:09.200
 yeah, it can put you in a place.

1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:15.680
 I mean, David Yadin, he's a researcher in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins, he's

1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:21.880
 a great guy, and he's done research that has found that when people are in their transitional

1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:25.800
 moments of life, you know, and it could be a career change, it could be a divorce, it

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:31.520
 could be that they're nearing the end of their life, that they very often will say those

1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:36.080
 are their most meaningful moments and their most spiritual moments, and so I feel like

1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:39.840
 that's what Leonard Cohn knows how to tap into instinctively.

1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:45.120
 The year after he died, his son, Adam Cohn, made a memorial concert for him where all

1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:51.680
 these famous musicians came to Montreal, where they had lived and performed his music, and

1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:56.160
 my husband, who's not a Leonard Cohn fan, and he's not a bittersweet type at all, but

1:12:56.160 --> 1:13:00.280
 he knows how I feel about him, he's like, you know, you should really go to that concert.

1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:06.560
 And I felt so ridiculous, the whole family went all the way to Montreal on a Monday.

1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:07.560
 On a Monday.

1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:12.240
 On a Monday, it was just like a random Monday, and we got on the plane, so like everyone's

1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:21.360
 at a school just so I can go to this concert, and I got there, and at the beginning, I was

1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:27.440
 feeling like, oh, this was all a terrible mistake because it's all these other musicians

1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:31.000
 playing this music, and I don't actually really want to hear them, like I'd rather listen

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:40.160
 to him on YouTube, and then a musician named Damian Rice came and played famous blue raincoat,

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:46.680
 and he sang it, and he did the most amazing thing at the end, the whole thing was amazing,

1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:52.360
 but then at the end, he sang this musical riff that was like, all I could say is that

1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:59.240
 it was like a musical lamentation of the ages, and the whole audience just rose silently to

1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:04.760
 its feet, and it was one of the greatest moments that I've ever had.

1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:10.400
 There's sometimes certain artists in a cover can capture in some kind of deeper way, like

1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:16.800
 carrying the thread of the power of the song, so I've been listening a lot to Johnny Cash

1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:20.560
 Hart, which is a 90's snails, Trent Reznor's song.

1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:24.520
 You talked about it on your podcast with Rick Rubin, which is when I reached out to you,

1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:28.120
 because I love that interview, and I love that song also.

1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:33.240
 Yeah, yeah, so there's that, there's the Kennedy Center Honors where they celebrate

1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:37.840
 a certain artist, they did that for Led Zeppelin, and I forgot what her name is, but the lead

1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:45.360
 singer of Hart performs there with Heaven, and it's like, if you're like, all right,

1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:49.960
 you take one of the great sort of rock songs of all time, what do you do in front of, oh,

1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:54.400
 the cool thing is you get to perform this in front of the artist while they're still

1:14:54.400 --> 1:14:59.760
 there and they're still alive, so you get to watch you sort of perform, in that case,

1:14:59.760 --> 1:15:03.680
 the President and President Obama's there, and she's just knocked it out of the park,

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:11.560
 but at the same time, without outdoing the original somehow.

1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:13.400
 Right, you're just making it your own.

1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:19.240
 You're making it your own, but not departing completely, not departing from the spirit

1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:20.400
 of the original.

1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:27.320
 It's tough because the original Hollywood by Leonard Cohen, it's just not, it's so

1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:32.080
 powerful, but it's just not as good as some of these covers.

1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:36.920
 Well I think it's the words and the melody, and then the covers take it to a different

1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:37.920
 place.

1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:45.360
 The thing that Leonard Cohen seems to do well, I don't think he did it on Hallelujah,

1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:51.920
 because he was almost being playful on Hallelujah, like I don't know, as opposed to that deep

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:59.360
 melancholy, like painful longing thing that Jeff Buckley did and others do too.

1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:04.400
 I wonder if it's because in a way, I don't think that he overedited it, but he apparently

1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:09.040
 worked on that song for years and went through gazillions of verses and checked most of them

1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:10.200
 out.

1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:15.840
 So I wonder if we're hearing his version after he's a little tired with that process.

1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:22.480
 Yeah, well that's the other thing is, maybe from a book tour, you know, it's like you

1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:27.440
 get tired of saying the same thing over and over and over and over, you forget the...

1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:30.240
 You forget like the initial, like the heart of it.

1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:36.560
 Yeah, but I actually got a chance to hang out with Dan Reynolds, who's the lead singer

1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:45.360
 of Imagine Dragons, and this is an incredible band, Super Pop, the most played band on Spotify

1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:46.360
 or something.

1:16:46.360 --> 1:16:47.360
 Is that right?

1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:50.440
 He just went through a huge Imagine Dragons phase, so we were listening to their music

1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:51.440
 a lot.

1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:56.680
 It was so surreal to be hanging out with them, and he's such a good, like very few people

1:16:56.680 --> 1:17:01.240
 I've met in my life are just as good of a human being, and that has to do with the fact

1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:02.240
 that he struggles.

1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:07.600
 He still, I think struggles, but he struggled for a long time with depression, and so out

1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:15.440
 of that pain, you see born this really good human being, this really good relationship

1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:22.560
 with his wife, like when times are good, they lean on each other for like they're deeply

1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:29.400
 grateful for those precious moments, so it's beautiful to watch, but he said that it's

1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:37.440
 really important to feel the song every time, otherwise people know, people are really good

1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:42.400
 at detecting your bullshit, you can't fake it, you really have to feel it every time,

1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:47.280
 you have to feel the emotion of it, whatever the emotion is, of the original time you wrote

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:48.280
 it.

1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:56.280
 Yeah, so it's just interesting, because I thought you could maybe fake it, but he believes

1:17:56.280 --> 1:17:59.560
 of course, and he's like, because he played in front of the gigantic crowds, and over

1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:03.480
 and over and over and over and over, he's like, no, every time you have to be there.

1:18:03.480 --> 1:18:07.880
 But there's got to be times when he's about to go out, and he's not feeling it, and he

1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:11.120
 has to figure out some way of getting himself into that heart space.

1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:16.040
 Well, that's what he's saying, you have to, otherwise you're just, that's the job, don't

1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:24.560
 take the job then, and he loves it, he says the biggest struggle in fact is the come down

1:18:24.560 --> 1:18:29.680
 from that, which is like, you have such a beautiful experience of connected with this

1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:37.600
 large number of people, sharing a song that you love, and then it's such a rush of connection,

1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:44.000
 and then you have to, you know, when you get off stage, you're now back to normal life,

1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:47.520
 and that's why a lot of musicians get into heavy drugs and all that kind of stuff, because

1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:53.480
 you're looking for that rush again, it's very tough to like, then go into this, speaking

1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:59.600
 of introvert, because he probably is an introvert, as is like, you have to find that calmness,

1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:03.640
 and how do you find the calmness when you were just playing in front of tens of thousands

1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:08.400
 of people, or hundreds of thousands, whatever that number is, that rush of connect, and

1:19:08.400 --> 1:19:12.680
 everybody, there's love in the air, and you still have to find that like inner peace and

1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:13.680
 calm.

1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:17.720
 That's interesting, because I, so I don't know if this is the introvert in me talking,

1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:24.280
 and the writer in me talking, but I don't know, like I love most the moments where let's

1:19:24.280 --> 1:19:30.240
 say I'll get a letter from a reader who will tell me what something I wrote meant to them,

1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:33.640
 and they'll talk about having had that kind of moment of, you know, the communion between

1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:37.360
 the writer and the reader, and obviously I wasn't there physically when it happened,

1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:42.280
 so I wasn't getting that kind of rush that a musician would get in a concert, but just

1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:46.480
 the knowledge of that having happened out there in the world, due to something that

1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:50.200
 I added to it, is the most amazing thing.

1:19:50.200 --> 1:19:54.720
 You love it, but imagine, imagine reading like thousands of those letters, and then

1:19:54.720 --> 1:20:01.760
 it's such a strong rush that everything else doesn't, it could be overwhelming, I guess,

1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:07.160
 but like anything else, you have to come down and find a calm place, like for example, the

1:20:07.160 --> 1:20:12.360
 danger with getting letters like that, you start taking yourself too seriously, you think

1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:18.960
 like you are a special person somehow, but that's, you really want to avoid that feeling

1:20:18.960 --> 1:20:19.960
 too.

1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:23.840
 Yeah, I don't actually experience as that much different from when I'm on the other

1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:29.120
 side of it, like if I'm the reader, and some other writer has made me feel that way, to

1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:30.120
 me it's the same thing.

1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:34.760
 Yeah, me too, yeah, it's a cool, it's a virtual hug.

1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:42.640
 I think it's like, I was just listening to something about the different Russian writers,

1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:47.760
 I was mentioning to you this academic, his name is Gary Salmorsen, and he studies Russian

1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:52.040
 literature, and he was talking about, I don't know if I'll be able to get this right, but

1:20:52.040 --> 1:20:57.440
 basically that the people misunderstand a work like Anna Karenina, and that we think

1:20:57.440 --> 1:21:05.880
 of it as telling us that you're supposed to live, you're supposed to have like his grand

1:21:05.880 --> 1:21:13.560
 tempestuous romances that might end in death or despair or whatever it is, but you should

1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:16.240
 be in it for the intensity of the emotion.

1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:23.320
 And he's saying, actually, that's exactly not what Tolstoy was saying, that actually

1:21:23.320 --> 1:21:28.960
 it was the opposite, that he was really advocating for everyday life, he was saying it's scenes

1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:32.720
 from everyday, like he was juxtaposing Anna Karenina with all these other couples who

1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:39.200
 were just living happily and quietly day by day, and that was what he believed was the

1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:40.200
 ideal.

1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:46.200
 So, as opposed to the grand rush, and as opposed to the intensity.

1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:52.560
 I wonder if he, is there a depth to the, is there a romance just at day to day?

1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:55.280
 I think there is a romance to the day to day.

1:21:55.280 --> 1:21:56.280
 Absolutely.

1:21:56.280 --> 1:22:01.280
 Don't get distracted by the dopamine rollercoaster ride of the grand romantic notions.

1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:06.720
 Yeah, and enjoy it while it's happening, because those are life experiences also, but not to

1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:08.800
 mistake those for being everything.

1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:09.800
 Where is he from?

1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:11.480
 He's a professor at Northwestern.

1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:12.480
 At Northwestern.

1:22:12.480 --> 1:22:16.400
 And apparently his lectures are like the most popular on campus.

1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:17.400
 Wow.

1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:18.400
 People love him.

1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:22.200
 Gary Saul Morrison is an American literary critic and slavist.

1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:26.840
 He's particularly known for his scholarly work on the great Russian novel lists, Leo

1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:29.360
 Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:33.040
 Morrison is Lawrence D. Professor in the arts and humanities at Northwestern University.

1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:34.040
 Yeah.

1:22:34.040 --> 1:22:35.040
 Wow.

1:22:35.040 --> 1:22:36.040
 And there's a lot of incredible work.

1:22:36.040 --> 1:22:40.080
 And then I'm sure looking through the lens of Russian literature and the romance of all

1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:42.400
 of that, he's looking at the modern world.

1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:43.400
 Yeah.

1:22:43.400 --> 1:22:44.960
 I think you should have him on your podcast.

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:51.000
 And quiet flows the vodka, or when Pushkin comes to shove the curmudgeon's guide to Russian

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:55.440
 literature and culture, this is like one of the silly books he has on the list.

1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:56.440
 Okay.

1:22:56.440 --> 1:22:57.440
 Cool.

1:22:57.440 --> 1:22:58.440
 What were you saying?

1:22:58.440 --> 1:22:59.440
 I'm sorry.

1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:00.440
 Oh, no.

1:23:00.440 --> 1:23:01.440
 I was just saying, yeah.

1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:05.280
 Like I find that when I take photos on my phone, I hardly ever take photos at the moment

1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:06.280
 you're supposed to.

1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:08.720
 Like everybody is gathered for some event.

1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:12.840
 I'll forget to take the photo, but I take a lot of like scenes from everyday life because

1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:16.000
 that's what I actually want to remember in the end.

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.000
 Yeah.

1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:18.000
 Yeah.

1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000
 I'm the same.

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:21.000
 I'm the same.

1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:26.320
 It's actually concerning because it's bad for productivity because I love everyday life

1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:27.600
 so much.

1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:30.760
 Then why do any ambitious big thing?

1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:32.000
 Your productivity is pretty good.

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.560
 I don't know that you have to worry about it.

1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:35.560
 I do.

1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:37.520
 So I want to launch a business.

1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:39.400
 You know, I have a dream outside.

1:23:39.400 --> 1:23:45.920
 This is like a fun side thing that, you know, I want to, there's been a lifelong passion.

1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:46.920
 Anyway, that's a...

1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:47.920
 I like building.

1:23:47.920 --> 1:23:51.600
 I like building stuff and I haven't been doing that as much as I would like.

1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:58.080
 That's because largely, because I like sitting in silence and enjoying the beauty that is

1:23:58.080 --> 1:24:03.280
 just nature and life and when there's people, there's people, I love people.

1:24:03.280 --> 1:24:04.280
 I love everything.

1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:08.840
 And so when you love everything, why go through hell to build a company?

1:24:08.840 --> 1:24:09.840
 Yeah.

1:24:09.840 --> 1:24:11.720
 That's a valid question.

1:24:11.720 --> 1:24:15.200
 I mean, I think you have to have a really good reason for wanting to do it.

1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:19.480
 And then your heart calls you for the certain, sometimes you look out into the mountains

1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:24.120
 and you say, for some reason I long to go there, even if it means leaving the tribe

1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:30.600
 and putting yourself in danger and doing stupid shit, that's a human imperative for

1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:31.600
 exploration.

1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:32.600
 Yeah.

1:24:32.600 --> 1:24:33.600
 Absolutely.

1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:37.120
 Like when we were talking about, you know, this idea of longing being like the source

1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:42.440
 code of humanity, I think that's also the source code of our creativity.

1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.720
 It's the same longing for Eden.

1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:49.240
 It's like you're always reaching for something that you want to get to or that you want to

1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:50.240
 build.

1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:51.240
 Yeah.

1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:53.000
 It's the best of us.

1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:02.320
 What do you think, you write about creativity and sadness, practically speaking, how should

1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:06.040
 we leverage sadness for creativity?

1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:12.240
 Is that sort of in the artist domain, in the writer's domain, in the engineering domains

1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:13.240
 and so on?

1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:17.960
 It's definitely in those domains, but it's in all domains, you know, we're all going

1:25:17.960 --> 1:25:21.160
 to face pain in this life at some point.

1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:29.280
 And we all have the ability to weather it and withstand it and live with it for a bit

1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:35.680
 and then try to transform it into something that we find beautiful, you know, and it's

1:25:35.680 --> 1:25:45.080
 very easy to notice the grandeur of like the painting hanging on the gallery wall or the

1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:49.480
 new company that's just been created, but it takes a thousand different forms, right?

1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:55.040
 You could bake a cake or like in the wake of the pandemic, we've had more people applying

1:25:55.040 --> 1:25:57.440
 to medical school and nursing school.

1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:03.040
 And after 9 11, you had people applying for jobs as firefighters and teachers.

1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:08.280
 So there's something in the human spirit that takes pain and turns it into meaning when

1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:10.080
 we're at our best.

1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:14.640
 And when we're not at our best, we deny the pain and then take it out on ourselves and

1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:15.640
 on other people.

1:26:15.640 --> 1:26:19.400
 So there's a kind of fork in the road of what to do with it.

1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:23.520
 But we know, I mean, there's all these studies that I go through in the book.

1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:31.160
 There is one where the researchers had people watch different movies, like happy movies,

1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:35.920
 sad movies, bittersweet movies, and they found when people watched Father of the Bride, just

1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:41.280
 like the ultimate bittersweet, you know, you're walking your daughter down the aisle, kind

1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:46.960
 of feeling that was, they would give them creativity tasks after watching these different

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:47.960
 movies.

1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:51.880
 And the people who had been primed for bittersweetness were the most creative, and they were like

1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:59.200
 primed to remember finality, you know, like love and finality, basically, love and impermanence.

1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:04.240
 There's something about that that's, that gets us to our most beautiful state.

1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:07.640
 I wonder if it is, I mean, there's studies like that, there's a, I don't know if you've

1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:09.840
 looked into the terror management theory.

1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:11.640
 Yeah, that's really interesting stuff.

1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:20.120
 So they, especially intensely, have you focused on not just sad, but traumatic, like death,

1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:26.520
 prime you with death and see how that changes your mind, like both like, I don't, I don't

1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:32.840
 know if those creativity studies, but they have interesting, I think a little bit tainted

1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:35.280
 by political bias, but maybe not.

1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:40.280
 I mean, psychology is a complicated field, but they, they study like who are you likely

1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:41.880
 to vote for, right?

1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:47.560
 If you're primed by existential, like by thinking about death, fear of mortality, fear of mortality.

1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:52.160
 I forget what the conclusions are, but I think they find that people become more tribalistic.

1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:53.160
 Yeah.

1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:59.200
 And like there was one study where they found that after they primed people that way, that

1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:04.800
 they would get, then give them the chance to put hot sauce on a meal that their political

1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:09.720
 opponents were going to be eating and they put way too much hot sauce on after they've

1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:12.080
 been primed to worry about death.

1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:16.120
 I think at the core were simple creatures.

1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:21.200
 So I actually, like in the book, I spent a bunch of time with people who are working

1:28:21.200 --> 1:28:26.360
 on radical life extension, you know, or the quest to live forever.

1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:29.440
 And people ask them a lot questions like, you know, the kinds of questions you were

1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:30.440
 talking about earlier.

1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:34.600
 Well, like how are you going to feed everybody and how is there going to be space for everybody?

1:28:34.600 --> 1:28:37.280
 If everyone really could live forever.

1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:41.160
 And what about conflict when we haven't intensified conflict?

1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:47.520
 And their answer to that is they point to terror management theory, you know, when they say

1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:52.160
 because it's the fear of death, they're basically saying it's the fear of death that are causing

1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:53.360
 our conflicts in the first place.

1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:58.880
 And that if we removed the fear of death, we'd have less conflict to contend with.

1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:01.400
 And that, I don't really buy that.

1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:06.080
 It's possible that that's true, but are you also, how does the expression go throwing

1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:08.640
 out the baby with the bathwater?

1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:15.880
 Are you also going to remove basically any source of meaning and happiness in the human

1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:16.880
 condition?

1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:22.160
 Like it's very possible that death is fundamental to the human condition, the finality.

1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:23.160
 Yeah.

1:29:23.160 --> 1:29:26.360
 And that's the great philosophical question.

1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:31.640
 And I went to a conference of people who are working on this and I thought that they

1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:36.240
 were going to be talking about those questions all through the conference, but the MO is

1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:41.160
 much more like, we're so happy that we're here with people who have gotten past all

1:29:41.160 --> 1:29:42.160
 those quibbles.

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:43.160
 Yeah.

1:29:43.160 --> 1:29:45.520
 You know, and we just know there's going to be meaning no matter what.

1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:52.200
 The basic assumption is, let's try to extend life indefinitely and then we'll figure out

1:29:52.200 --> 1:29:54.200
 if that's a good decision.

1:29:54.200 --> 1:29:58.960
 Or more like, we're sure it's a good decision or at least that was what I felt.

1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:07.960
 It's either we're sure it's a good decision or we're sure that it's good to believe that

1:30:07.960 --> 1:30:14.160
 it's a good decision, meaning like there's no downside to that, even if we find out it's

1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:15.160
 wrong.

1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:16.160
 But there's a kind of certainty.

1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:18.680
 Obviously, you want to extend human life.

1:30:18.680 --> 1:30:27.320
 That's the kind of assumption that always seemed, now, it could be true, but just like

1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:37.960
 the people who over focus on colonizing other planets, it feels like you neglect the beauty

1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:41.320
 and the struggle of our life here on earth.

1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:46.240
 I have sort of a same kind of criticism, whether it's thinking about Valhalla or any other

1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:56.320
 afterlife is you can have, if you're not careful, forget to make this life a great one, whatever

1:30:56.320 --> 1:30:57.800
 happens afterwards.

1:30:57.800 --> 1:30:59.120
 So yeah, definitely.

1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:02.720
 But from an engineering, from a biology, from a chemistry perspective, it's very interesting

1:31:02.720 --> 1:31:05.680
 to think how do we extend this thing?

1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:11.000
 Because it does seem then nature, the way it designed living organisms.

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:14.640
 It really wants us to die.

1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:19.600
 Because that's part of the selection mechanism, this part seems to be fundamental to evolution.

1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:24.080
 It gets people young, they need protection.

1:31:24.080 --> 1:31:28.240
 Once they're young brain, they get to explore a lot, get to figure out the world, they come

1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:34.360
 up with their own novel ideas, how to adapt and how to respond to that world.

1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:39.200
 And then it's get older and older, they get like stubborn and stuck in their ways.

1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:46.320
 So we need them to die, so we make room for a new life that's able to adapt to the changing

1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:47.320
 environment.

1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:54.240
 If the old doesn't die, then you're not, you're going to get stale and not be adaptable to

1:31:54.240 --> 1:31:55.640
 the changing environment.

1:31:55.640 --> 1:31:58.000
 But maybe it doesn't have to happen so soon.

1:31:58.000 --> 1:31:59.480
 Yeah, maybe it doesn't.

1:31:59.480 --> 1:32:05.920
 It's like pressing, listen, I'm a big fan of pressing snooze, and the alarm clock, I'm

1:32:05.920 --> 1:32:13.720
 in the same way, I'm one of the people that believe it's, or I don't definitely believe,

1:32:13.720 --> 1:32:23.600
 of course, I don't know, but I think death is a fundamental part of life.

1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:27.640
 But yeah, if I'm on my deathbed, I would share as help or snooze as many times as possible.

1:32:27.640 --> 1:32:34.840
 Yeah, I know, and it's interesting because in some ways I really, I share your instinct.

1:32:34.840 --> 1:32:39.080
 There was one scientist I spoke to at that conference, he's one of the leading advocates,

1:32:39.080 --> 1:32:45.000
 and he said, you know, that's a story that we've invented for ourselves because we have

1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.000
 no choice.

1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:50.400
 And if you really believe that you have no choice, then you're, then it's adaptive to

1:32:50.400 --> 1:32:52.960
 tell that story that death gives meaning to life.

1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:53.960
 That's a good point.

1:32:53.960 --> 1:32:57.760
 But if you really think you don't, if you really think you could triumph over it, would

1:32:57.760 --> 1:32:59.880
 you still be telling that same story?

1:32:59.880 --> 1:33:02.920
 And I've been thinking about that question ever since.

1:33:02.920 --> 1:33:06.120
 Yeah, yeah, no, they got a good point.

1:33:06.120 --> 1:33:07.120
 They got a good point.

1:33:07.120 --> 1:33:12.760
 No matter what, as an engineering and the scientific pursuits, it's a beautiful one.

1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:18.440
 In your own personal life, if you can go there, what's have been some dark places you've

1:33:18.440 --> 1:33:29.480
 gone in your own mind, grief, loss, sad moments, moments of sadness that have made you a better

1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:34.480
 writer, a better creator, a better human being?

1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:40.680
 Well, I mean, I've been through a lot of bereavement just in these last couple of years with COVID,

1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:48.040
 but even before that, I mean, there's all kinds of stuff I write about it in the book.

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:52.600
 And in some ways, I feel like I can write about those kinds of things better than I can speak

1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:53.600
 them.

1:33:53.600 --> 1:34:00.320
 There's a really complicated relationship with my mother growing up, where we had a kind

1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:06.320
 of garden of Eden during my childhood, like we were intensely, intensely close.

1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:18.760
 And my mother, because of some vulnerabilities that she had reacted with a lot of trouble

1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:26.280
 to my adolescence and to growing independent from her and starting to have different religious

1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:33.280
 views and different political views and all kinds of things.

1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:38.760
 And we had a pretty intense break that I described in the book.

1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:45.440
 And it was so intense that even though after that, we still would get together for holidays

1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:50.920
 and talk to each other on the phone and all that, there was a sense in which it was over

1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:51.920
 at that point.

1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:53.480
 The relationship was over.

1:34:53.480 --> 1:34:55.640
 The garden of Eden was no more.

1:34:55.640 --> 1:34:56.640
 Yeah.

1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:05.480
 It was like a feeling of like, yeah, I know what Eden was like, and it's not there anymore.

1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:10.600
 And I think it was all the more confusing, because if you lose someone to actual bereavement,

1:35:10.600 --> 1:35:14.720
 you go through a mourning process, and people have thought for thousands of years about

1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:19.760
 how to do that, but with something like this, there's no process because you're not even

1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:23.880
 admitting to yourself, especially when you're like in your teens and twenties, that you're

1:35:23.880 --> 1:35:28.520
 mourning something.

1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:34.280
 But it was the case that for decades, for decades, I could not answer even the simplest

1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:39.920
 question about my mother, like, where did she grow up without tears in my eyes, or more

1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:42.760
 than tears in my eyes, like embarrassing tears.

1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:48.200
 So I would just try to steer the subject in another place.

1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:51.400
 But I will say, you know, two things happened.

1:35:51.400 --> 1:35:56.880
 One is that I've spent the last six, seven years writing this book about joy and sorrow

1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:02.720
 and loss and love and all of it, and I've really come to terms with all of it.

1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:08.080
 And then the second thing that happened is my mother now has Alzheimer's.

1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:13.760
 And in her Alzheimer's, she's still actually the same person.

1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:17.560
 Like, she's forgotten most things, but she still has these conversational lanes that

1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:21.560
 you can travel down that are like the way she always was.

1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:27.880
 And the way that she was when I was a kid, which was like so incredibly loving and so

1:36:27.880 --> 1:36:34.560
 connected and so warm and sweet and funny and all of it, all the things I remembered,

1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:36.480
 like it's all come back.

1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:45.040
 And for all these decades, I had been wondering whether that Garden of Eden I remembered had

1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:50.240
 actually happened, or whether, you know, that was just like the fantasy of a child.

1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:53.560
 And you know, maybe it was always difficult and I had not seen it.

1:36:53.560 --> 1:36:59.560
 But I'm seeing her now, and I realized that it was all true, everything I remember, it

1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:00.560
 was all true.

1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:03.160
 It all happened because it's happening again.

1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:12.560
 And you returned to the Garden of Eden for a time and to childhood, it's always a question

1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:14.680
 of whether you can return to that place.

1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:15.680
 Well, I don't know.

1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:19.680
 I don't even know if I'd say I've returned because I'm a different person now and I don't

1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:20.680
 need her.

1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:21.680
 Are you sure?

1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:22.680
 Are you sure?

1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:23.680
 Yeah.

1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:24.680
 Are you sure?

1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:27.680
 You're different than the 10 year old?

1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:28.680
 Well, okay.

1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:29.680
 You feel different?

1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:34.560
 You know, I mean, I'm the same person in terms of my need for love and love of love and all

1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:35.560
 of that.

1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:41.960
 But I don't look, I'm not dependent on my mother for it the way I was then.

1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:43.800
 And that makes the experience really different.

1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:44.800
 Yeah.

1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:49.560
 When you're younger, she's a God figure.

1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:50.560
 What is that?

1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:56.040
 That the roots to parents, such a funny civilization will live and there's a depth of connection

1:37:56.040 --> 1:38:02.000
 to parents that's probably more powerful than anything else in terms of its formative effect

1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:03.160
 on who you are.

1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:04.960
 I think it's the most powerful.

1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:10.560
 And in fact, when this started happening, I got to college and I took a class in creative

1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:15.320
 writing and I tried to write a story, a fictional story, a fictionalized version of what was

1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:16.320
 happening.

1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:21.480
 And I called it the most passionate love because of what you just said.

1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:24.840
 And the teacher actually said to me, she was like, you know, you should put this story

1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:30.800
 in a drawer and not take it out again for 30 years because you're way too close to it.

1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:35.240
 So I've now finally written it 30 years later.

1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:41.000
 Yeah, you're probably still too close to it though.

1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:42.000
 I don't know though.

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:47.880
 I mean, I do think like, I think everybody goes through experiences in this life where

1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:53.880
 you're experiencing like a fundamental pain of separation and desire for a union.

1:38:53.880 --> 1:38:56.640
 And it takes so many different forms.

1:38:56.640 --> 1:38:58.680
 And this was my primal form of it.

1:38:58.680 --> 1:39:04.240
 But you know, for someone else, it's a betrayal or a bereavement or an exile from a country

1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:07.240
 of their birth or whatever it is.

1:39:07.240 --> 1:39:11.880
 And then you get to solve that puzzle for the rest of your life.

1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:19.000
 Yeah, the fact of like, I really do believe that, you know, that the original love that

1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:24.240
 we long for, like that one of the great things that you learn as you grow older is that the

1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:29.000
 love exists in some plane that's more general than the particularized form in which you

1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:30.000
 first knew it.

1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:36.560
 Yeah, I mean, that's why despite all the creepy interpretations was why even though Sigmund

1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:42.040
 Freud is probably wrong in the details, he was the first one to sort of suggest that

1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:47.800
 our experiences, I mean, he said that that was really controversial at the time when

1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:52.000
 young people, they start having sexual thoughts like at like age two or something, whatever

1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:53.440
 the hell he said.

1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:58.600
 So you develop this kind of connection to the opposite sex or whatever it did to your

1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:01.680
 mother, to your parents.

1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:08.200
 And I think while a lot of that is shown to be probably not true, what is like a deeper

1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:12.880
 truth there is your first early experiences of love or depth of connection are probably

1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:21.000
 somehow strongly formative of your conception of love and your definition of the perfect

1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.680
 thing you're reaching for for the rest of your life.

1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:25.240
 Yeah, I think that's right.

1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:28.360
 And you can really see it when you become a parent too.

1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:30.560
 You know, you can just see like there's

1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:32.760
 Don't screw it up.

1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:37.440
 You know, I have to say it like, I mean, knock on wood, I actually feel like, like we're

1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:38.440
 doing pretty well.

1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:44.160
 Like my kids are teenagers now, and I really had thought that I wasn't going to repeat

1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:45.800
 the issues that I had been through with my mom.

1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:53.600
 And I can say I really am not, um, yeah, like my mom for various reasons, just had a lot

1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:58.320
 of trouble with my independence, and I just don't feel that at all.

1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:04.640
 So yeah, there might, there might be other things you're totally blind to, I guess that's

1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:05.640
 possible.

1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:10.160
 But that's the way of parenting is you solve the problems of the past, but there's another

1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:11.160
 new one.

1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:15.000
 I guess I'll find out in 120 years, but like so far, so good.

1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:20.480
 What wisdom about parenting can you give from your own experience and from your writing?

1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:24.400
 Yeah, well, oh my God, there's a lot to say.

1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:33.720
 So on the bittersweet side of things, the wisdom that I would give is that especially

1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:42.080
 for kids who are growing up in relative comfort with everything going pretty well, they get

1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:49.280
 the idea that real life is when things are going well, and when things don't go well,

1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:54.360
 it's like a detour from the main road, as opposed to understanding that it's all the

1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:55.360
 main road.

1:41:55.360 --> 1:42:02.080
 And I tell the story in the book of this time that we went on this family vacation where

1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:08.240
 we rented a house in the countryside, and the house was next to this field where lived

1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:13.360
 two donkeys that our kids fell in love with, and they were like really little at the time,

1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:14.360
 two boys.

1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:19.120
 And they're spending all this time feeding carrots to the donkeys, and it's all beautiful.

1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:22.960
 And then comes the day where they realized that we're leaving in like two days, and they're

1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:25.040
 never going to see these donkeys again.

1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:27.440
 And they start crying themselves to sleep.

1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:32.720
 And the usual things that parents might say at a moment like that of like, maybe we'll

1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:37.800
 come back or another family will feed them, we'll feed these donkeys, none of that made

1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:39.800
 any difference.

1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:48.680
 But when we said to them, goodbye is part of life, and this feeling you're having, everybody

1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:53.040
 has it, you've had it before, you're going to have it again, you'll feel better in a

1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:58.360
 couple of days, but this is the way it's supposed to be, this is natural.

1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:03.520
 That's when they stopped crying, because I think that's when they stopped resisting.

1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:04.520
 Yeah.

1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:08.920
 Like it's one thing to feel the pain of goodbye, and it's another thing to be feeling like

1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:11.720
 this isn't supposed to be happening.

1:43:11.720 --> 1:43:16.160
 It's the resistance part of this isn't supposed to be happening that makes life really difficult.

1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:17.160
 Yeah.

1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:19.840
 As opposed to a more clear eyed view of what it really is.

1:43:19.840 --> 1:43:21.680
 This isn't supposed to be happening.

1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:24.760
 There's a show called Yellowstone, I recently started watching.

1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:25.760
 Yeah.

1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:26.760
 No, I've heard of it.

1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:30.000
 We actually started watching it, but only a few minutes and didn't get into it.

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.920
 So there's just a quick, it's not a spoiler of any kind, but there's a father taking

1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:40.120
 out the son for the first time to go hunting and to shoot their first buck.

1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:46.280
 And the son is really sad because he pulls a trigger and he took a life.

1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:51.840
 And the father says that everybody gets killed in this life.

1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:53.160
 That's the way of nature.

1:43:53.160 --> 1:43:57.280
 That's the way each one of us is going to get killed.

1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:03.000
 And it's interesting because I didn't really think of it that way because you think you

1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:10.760
 die, but he really framed it as killed because he's like, there's no such thing as dying

1:44:10.760 --> 1:44:12.160
 of old age.

1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:17.840
 That's medically, let's discuss that a bit, but basically there's something, whether it's

1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:26.120
 a truck or a bacteria, something's going to kill you in the end.

1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:32.960
 And that was an interesting way to look at it because we tend to think of humans aren't

1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:34.120
 supposed to be killed.

1:44:34.120 --> 1:44:39.120
 We think of murder as one of the things that you don't do in society.

1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:44.840
 But you know what, we do, that's a more technical discussion whether we ultimately get killed

1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:49.560
 by something in the end, but to some degree that's true, at least for most of us, that

1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:53.800
 there's something that gets us, whether it's cancer, those kinds of things.

1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:54.800
 It's interesting.

1:44:54.800 --> 1:44:59.840
 But yeah, that reframing of it's supposed to be this is the way of the world.

1:44:59.840 --> 1:45:00.840
 Yeah.

1:45:00.840 --> 1:45:01.840
 Though it's funny.

1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:05.640
 I mean, at the same time that I just wrote a whole book about the fact that this is the

1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:06.640
 way it is.

1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:11.520
 I really do believe this is the way it is and with this reality, there's an intense beauty

1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:16.080
 that comes along with it, so we have to accept the reality to get to the beauty.

1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:17.080
 I believe that.

1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:22.200
 And at the same time, there's a part of me that's just like, yeah, but give me the magic

1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:24.520
 wand to make the world different.

1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:25.520
 Yeah.

1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:26.520
 Yeah.

1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:27.520
 Yeah.

1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:28.520
 I don't know.

1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:30.040
 I don't know how much of this is a female thing too.

1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:34.120
 Like I was watching with my son, my 12 year old the other day, we were watching this show

1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:44.920
 about the battle of Thermopylae, and it was all about valor and glory on the battlefield.

1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:51.400
 And I said to him something like, gosh, don't you just wish we lived in a world where you

1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:54.920
 didn't have to do all this in order for everyone just to live their lives?

1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:58.000
 And he just looked at me completely puzzled.

1:45:58.000 --> 1:45:59.000
 Like, no.

1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:04.360
 To him, it all just seemed self evident that the world would be structured that way.

1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:09.840
 And he had the 12 year old admiration for the valor of it all.

1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:17.240
 But you wonder if that's nature or nurture.

1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:21.280
 I wonder what that world looks like.

1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:26.000
 We do live in a world where murder is seen as bad, but you look at a lot of the human

1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:27.000
 history.

1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:30.960
 I don't know if they had the same kind of conception of that.

1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:38.640
 In terms of, you have to ask what kind of murder for what purpose?

1:46:38.640 --> 1:46:41.760
 War was a way of life.

1:46:41.760 --> 1:46:42.760
 It's interesting.

1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:51.560
 It's interesting if we can imagine properly a future that is different than ours in terms

1:46:51.560 --> 1:46:53.560
 of operating under the different moral systems.

1:46:53.560 --> 1:47:01.960
 But I'd like the same with living indefinitely or living in a society with no war.

1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:04.360
 Like how fundamental is war?

1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:05.360
 How fundamental is death?

1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:08.640
 I mean, I think it's so fundamental to our source code.

1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:10.960
 I just wish that our source code were different, basically.

1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:14.960
 Well, it's people working on that, right?

1:47:14.960 --> 1:47:18.640
 There's brain computer interfaces that try to merge.

1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:24.080
 So greater and greater, we have smartphones, we're already cyborgs, but greater and greater

1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:27.000
 merger of computational power.

1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:33.600
 So literally adding source code to our original source code, there's the mushy biology that

1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:40.880
 runs source code, and then there's more cold electrical systems, and then they integrate

1:47:40.880 --> 1:47:41.880
 together.

1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:50.000
 So actually, one day, we offload the magic that is human consciousness also into the

1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.320
 machine, and then we'll get to see.

1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:58.520
 Maybe there'll be a little bit less assholeish about the whole war thing, there'd be more.

1:47:58.520 --> 1:48:05.000
 But there is, I think, even when I think about engineering human intelligence or superhuman

1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:10.200
 intelligence systems, I feel like they also need to have the yin and yang of life.

1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:15.760
 They have to be able to be afraid and to be sad and all those kinds of things.

1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:20.080
 But maybe it's because I'm a product in this particular environment.

1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:26.680
 Maybe sadness is a human, useful human invention, but not a universal one.

1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:30.840
 This is what I don't know, because this is where I come back to the, as I told you, like

1:48:30.840 --> 1:48:36.040
 the original reason that I wrote my whole book was the feeling that somehow in the expression

1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:42.000
 of sad music is what other people see when they talk about God, like there's something

1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:48.600
 so, there's like an ultimate beauty there that I don't know if we have access to without

1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:49.600
 that.

1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:50.600
 But maybe we do.

1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:55.560
 But I can say in this world, that's a great way to get access to that state.

1:48:55.560 --> 1:49:00.080
 Is it within the reach of science or deeply understand this, you think, to understand

1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:02.720
 that why you feel sad when you're listening to a song?

1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:05.680
 Or why you feel so much love when you're listening to a sad song?

1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:07.560
 Do a sad song, right?

1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:15.600
 Why the sad song opens up some kind of deep connection to something you can call divine

1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:17.520
 or something, whatever the heck that is.

1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:19.160
 Yeah, I do think.

1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:24.280
 I mean, we have like really early signs of it from the research, and I'm sure we're just

1:49:24.280 --> 1:49:27.160
 at the scratching the surface stage.

1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:32.960
 But I mean, like we know, for example, that the vagus nerve, which is so fundamental that

1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:38.880
 it governs our breathing and our digestion, our vagus nerve also activates when we see

1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:46.680
 another being in distress, there's like an instinctive impulse to want to make it stop.

1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:51.520
 And the theory is that that's an evolutionary design, because we had to be able to respond

1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:56.920
 to the cries of our infants, you know, and from that ability grows the greater ability

1:49:56.920 --> 1:49:59.920
 to respond to other people's cries too.

1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:07.040
 So that's probably just, you know, the very first step in being able to understand what

1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:08.720
 all that is.

1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:13.120
 We've already given plenty of advice, but broadly, what advice would you give to young

1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:21.760
 folks today about career, about life, whether they want to be writers, lawyers, scientists,

1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:26.520
 musicians, and artists, whatever the heck they want to be, how can they live a life

1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:28.000
 they can be proud of?

1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:29.000
 Okay.

1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:38.680
 I think you should absolutely do that thing that you're dying to do.

1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:46.480
 But you should always have a plan B, like a backup plan and a way of earning a living,

1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:53.800
 no matter what happens, because I feel like people, we have this narrative in our culture

1:50:53.800 --> 1:51:00.480
 of like that the glamorous thing is to figure out the thing you love and then risk everything

1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:02.480
 to achieve that.

1:51:02.480 --> 1:51:06.000
 But first of all, a lot of people aren't comfortable with that level of risk.

1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:11.120
 And second, when you're living with that level of risk, that's a cognitive load too.

1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:15.760
 And so you don't have the full emotion and heart to be able to focus on the thing that

1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:19.000
 you actually really love, because you're like stressed out about it.

1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:23.960
 So I'd say like get the backup plan in place and then do the thing.

1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:25.480
 My advice would be the opposite.

1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:26.480
 Okay.

1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:27.480
 Tell me why.

1:51:27.480 --> 1:51:28.480
 I'm moving the romantic.

1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:37.760
 Well, I think the best, the truth is be aware of the cost not having a plan B has, so do

1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:40.160
 it deliberately if you don't.

1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:44.760
 But I, you know, I'm with Bukowski on find what you love and let it kill you.

1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:48.200
 I think you have to actually know your personality.

1:51:48.200 --> 1:51:55.480
 I know if I have a plan B, I will not try as hard on plan A. And I would likely take

1:51:55.480 --> 1:52:03.560
 plan B because if plan A is the risky thing, I just work way much better when in the state

1:52:03.560 --> 1:52:04.560
 of desperation.

1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:05.560
 Okay.

1:52:05.560 --> 1:52:08.160
 So with my back against the wall and you have to know that about yourself.

1:52:08.160 --> 1:52:09.160
 I think that has to do with...

1:52:09.160 --> 1:52:13.280
 So I think we can refine it to say you actually have to really know yourself and how you respond

1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:15.120
 to different kinds of risks.

1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:17.560
 Like I would not do well in that kind of situation.

1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:23.160
 I'd be like up at two in the morning, worrying about it, whereas if I have some, like it

1:52:23.160 --> 1:52:27.480
 doesn't have to be paying the rent in some grand way, but if there's some basic way of

1:52:27.480 --> 1:52:31.400
 paying the rent, then my heart's free to do the thing I really love.

1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:32.400
 That's hilarious.

1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:39.400
 I, for me, the only way I'm free is when I don't know how I'm going to pay the rent.

1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:40.400
 Huh.

1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:41.400
 Yeah.

1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:48.440
 Because otherwise I'll find a way to pay the rent that's not at all a source of deep fulfillment

1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:49.440
 for me.

1:52:49.440 --> 1:52:50.440
 I see.

1:52:50.440 --> 1:52:53.840
 So it's like if you don't have like the, what's the expression?

1:52:53.840 --> 1:52:57.720
 I don't know, something like the dog at your back, then you won't actually do it.

1:52:57.720 --> 1:53:01.680
 I create real or artificial deadlines, anxiety and so on.

1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:03.720
 So yeah, you have to...

1:53:03.720 --> 1:53:04.720
 Yeah.

1:53:04.720 --> 1:53:09.840
 So really the advice is know your triggers, but we're still saying the same basic thing

1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:14.720
 of like, do the thing you really love, but just set up the rest of your life.

1:53:14.720 --> 1:53:15.720
 The strategy is the rest of your life.

1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:16.720
 Yeah.

1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:17.720
 Yeah.

1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:18.720
 Exactly.

1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:19.720
 Exactly.

1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:21.960
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

1:53:21.960 --> 1:53:25.120
 The meaning of this whole thing?

1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:31.360
 Probably has something to do with whatever we feel when we listen to a sad song.

1:53:31.360 --> 1:53:32.360
 Yeah.

1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:37.720
 I, because two things come simultaneously to my mind when you ask that question and

1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:42.800
 I've been asking it since I was four, I remember the first time I did.

1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:45.080
 The question is more important than the answer probably.

1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:46.080
 Yeah.

1:53:46.080 --> 1:53:47.080
 Just keep asking.

1:53:47.080 --> 1:53:48.080
 I don't know.

1:53:48.080 --> 1:53:51.360
 The first one is beauty and I don't know why beauty is so important, but I just know that

1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:52.360
 it is.

1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:54.920
 And impossible to define perhaps.

1:53:54.920 --> 1:53:55.920
 Is it definable?

1:53:55.920 --> 1:53:56.920
 Yeah.

1:53:56.920 --> 1:53:59.960
 Other than you know it when you see it.

1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:00.960
 I don't know.

1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:01.960
 I mean, just...

1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:08.440
 It has to do with that line that you feel something when you just see it, when you hear it.

1:54:08.440 --> 1:54:09.440
 Yeah.

1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:14.760
 You just see it and it's like, like some, it's whatever can deliver you to that mode

1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:22.760
 of transcendence where you're no longer purely in your own self and you're in something higher.

1:54:22.760 --> 1:54:30.240
 And when you're in those states of mind, you know it because you have the temporary sensation

1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:35.040
 that you could die at that moment, that the people you love could die and it will all

1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:39.640
 be okay because there's something else.

1:54:39.640 --> 1:54:40.640
 So that's my first answer.

1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:41.640
 Beauty.

1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:47.840
 And then my second answer is the need to relieve psychic pain, like other people's psychic

1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:48.840
 pain.

1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:49.840
 I don't know why.

1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:51.800
 That's just, that's just like an impulse that I have.

1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:55.360
 Psychic pain is more like, like suffering of any form.

1:54:55.360 --> 1:54:56.360
 What is that?

1:54:56.360 --> 1:54:57.360
 Yeah.

1:54:57.360 --> 1:54:58.560
 But I mean...

1:54:58.560 --> 1:54:59.560
 Is there a particular...

1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:00.560
 Yeah.

1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:08.360
 Just making the world better and less pain, less pain to go around in general.

1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:16.040
 Hence your sort of optimistic desire and longing for a world without sort of destruction, without

1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:19.040
 malevolent destruction.

1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:20.040
 Yeah.

1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:22.160
 A world where that wouldn't be necessary.

1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:23.160
 Yeah.

1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:24.160
 Exactly.

1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:25.160
 Exactly.

1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:28.080
 But yeah, like I, so I had this moment.

1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:29.080
 It wasn't so long ago.

1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:34.320
 I was doing some interview and somebody asked me, like, what are you longing for right now?

1:55:34.320 --> 1:55:39.040
 And my answer at that moment was like, you know what, I'm actually at this moment in

1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:41.560
 life where I'm not longing for anything.

1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:46.760
 I'm at this particular way station where everything is the way I want it to be.

1:55:46.760 --> 1:55:51.920
 And of course, the minute you say something like that, you know, you're going to be proven

1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:57.560
 wrong because like an hour later, I get a letter from a reader who I've been in touch

1:55:57.560 --> 1:56:03.080
 with over the years and he was telling me about like a psychic struggle that he's going

1:56:03.080 --> 1:56:04.080
 through.

1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:09.760
 And I just felt like, oh my gosh, if there were anything I could do to make it that his

1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:13.360
 life wouldn't have been such that he would be in this position in the first place, like

1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:17.480
 his struggles had to do with a long life history.

1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:22.360
 So I don't know why I feel that so intently, but I do.

1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:27.440
 Those moments when you are just at peace, there's nothing else you want, feel like that's

1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:30.360
 like a temporary repose, like a pause.

1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:32.880
 Exactly.

1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:39.000
 You bet your ass a desire follows that at some point, but you get to enjoy those little

1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:40.000
 moments.

1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:41.000
 Yeah.

1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:44.400
 And even when he asked me and I answered that way, I said, this is a way station, like

1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:49.760
 I knew it was temporary, but I didn't realize it would be disrupted like an hour later.

1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:58.520
 And that sort of to give you pushback to your, to your statement about the possibility of

1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:04.360
 you can see a beauty and basically alleviating suffering is a quote I really like from Hunter

1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:10.000
 S. Thompson that pushes back against that, which is for every moment of triumph for every

1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:17.200
 instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled, but that's a very Hunter S. Thompson.

1:57:17.200 --> 1:57:22.800
 And you know how he ended up, he's not the greatest philosopher of all times, but he's

1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:26.480
 certainly a, a beautiful, a chaotic human being.

1:57:26.480 --> 1:57:27.480
 Well, that's true.

1:57:27.480 --> 1:57:32.680
 And I will tell you that my nickname for my husband is Gonzo, kind of because of him,

1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:38.840
 you know, he invented that form of Gonzo journalism where like the, the writer is totally in

1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:42.200
 the story and my husband, like that's his personality.

1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:44.160
 He's like in everything that he does.

1:57:44.160 --> 1:57:45.160
 He's really in it.

1:57:45.160 --> 1:57:46.160
 He's really present.

1:57:46.160 --> 1:57:47.320
 He just lives that way.

1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:53.640
 So well then, so his name is Ken, but I call him Gonzo like 90% of the time.

1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:55.600
 Well then that's a beautiful way to end this season.

1:57:55.600 --> 1:57:57.240
 This is a thank you for your work.

1:57:57.240 --> 1:57:58.800
 Thank you for being who you are.

1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:04.240
 Thank you for initially at least making me feel okay about being an introvert and educating

1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:06.680
 and making the rest of us feel great about being introverts.

1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:09.040
 It's like half the world or whatever the heck it is.

1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:12.180
 It's a lot of people.

1:58:12.180 --> 1:58:13.180
 Thank you for being you.

1:58:13.180 --> 1:58:14.680
 Well, thank you for talking today.

1:58:14.680 --> 1:58:15.680
 It was awesome.

1:58:15.680 --> 1:58:16.680
 Thank you so much.

1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:18.760
 It was so great to talk to you.

1:58:18.760 --> 1:58:22.360
 And I think it was the, what I said to you when we first got connected is thank you for

1:58:22.360 --> 1:58:24.080
 your way of being in the world.

1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:27.200
 I really, really love it.

1:58:27.200 --> 1:58:30.000
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Susan Cain.

1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:33.960
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

1:58:33.960 --> 1:58:38.560
 And now let me leave you with some words from Susan Cain herself.

1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:44.800
 The highly sensitive introvert tends to be philosophical or spiritual in their orientation

1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:48.880
 rather than materialistic or hedonistic.

1:58:48.880 --> 1:58:51.040
 They dislike small talk.

1:58:51.040 --> 1:58:54.800
 They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive.

1:58:54.800 --> 1:58:59.400
 They dream vividly and can often recall their dreams the next day.

1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:04.080
 They love music, nature, art and physical beauty.

1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:11.000
 They feel exceptionally strong emotions, sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy

1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:12.920
 and fear.

1:59:12.920 --> 1:59:17.400
 These sensitive people also process information about their environments, both physical and

1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:20.760
 emotional, unusually deeply.

1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:27.120
 They tend to notice subtleties that others miss, another person's shifted mood or a light

1:59:27.120 --> 1:59:31.520
 bulb burning a touch too brightly.

1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:44.840
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
