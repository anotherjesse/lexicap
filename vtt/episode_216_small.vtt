00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
 The following is a conversation with Vincent Reconyello,

00:03.400 --> 00:08.120
 professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia.

00:08.120 --> 00:10.840
 Vincent is one of the best educators in biology

00:10.840 --> 00:12.960
 and in general that I've ever had the pleasure

00:12.960 --> 00:14.360
 of speaking with.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.320
 I highly recommend you check out his This Week

00:17.320 --> 00:21.440
 in Virology podcast and watch his introductory lectures

00:21.440 --> 00:22.520
 on YouTube.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.920
 In particular, the playlist I recommend

00:24.920 --> 00:28.680
 is called Virology Lectures 2021.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.640
 To support this podcast, please check out the sponsors

00:31.640 --> 00:33.560
 in the description.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.360
 As a side note, please allow me to say a few words

00:36.360 --> 00:38.280
 about the COVID vaccines.

00:38.280 --> 00:41.360
 Some people are scared of a virus hurting or killing

00:41.360 --> 00:43.200
 somebody they love.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.680
 Some are scared of their government betraying them,

00:46.680 --> 00:50.280
 their leaders blinded by power and greed.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.080
 I have both of these fears.

00:52.080 --> 00:57.280
 And two, I'm afraid, as FDR said, of fear itself.

00:57.280 --> 01:01.280
 Fear manifests as anger and anger leads to division

01:01.280 --> 01:03.360
 in the hands of charismatic leaders

01:03.360 --> 01:06.760
 who then manufacture truth in quotes

01:06.760 --> 01:10.320
 that maximize controversy and a sense of imminent crisis

01:10.320 --> 01:13.320
 that only they can save us from.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.080
 And though I'm sometimes mocked for this,

01:16.080 --> 01:20.680
 I still believe that love, compassion, empathy

01:20.680 --> 01:23.600
 is the way out from this vicious downward spiral

01:23.600 --> 01:25.480
 of division.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.560
 I personally took the vaccine based

01:27.560 --> 01:29.440
 on my understanding of the data,

01:29.440 --> 01:31.880
 deciding that for me, the risk of negative effects

01:31.880 --> 01:34.840
 from COVID, short term and long term,

01:34.840 --> 01:37.120
 are far worse than the negative effects

01:37.120 --> 01:39.640
 from the mRNA vaccine.

01:39.640 --> 01:44.480
 I read, I thought, I decided, for me.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.800
 But I never have and never will talk down

01:47.800 --> 01:50.120
 to people who don't take the vaccine.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.480
 I'm humble enough to know just how little I know,

01:53.480 --> 01:56.240
 how wrong I have been and will be

01:56.240 --> 01:59.000
 on many of my beliefs and ideas.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.960
 I think dogmatic certainty and division

02:01.960 --> 02:05.560
 is more destructive in the long term than any virus.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.360
 The solution for me personally, like I said,

02:08.360 --> 02:10.480
 is to choose empathy and compassion

02:10.480 --> 02:13.200
 towards all fellow human beings

02:13.200 --> 02:15.560
 no matter who they voted for.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.240
 I hope you do the same.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.680
 Read, think, and try to imagine

02:20.680 --> 02:22.880
 that what you currently think is the truth

02:22.880 --> 02:24.800
 may be totally wrong.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.520
 This mindset is one that opens you

02:26.520 --> 02:29.560
 to discovery, innovation, and wisdom.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.080
 I hope my conversation with Vincent Racken Yellow

02:33.080 --> 02:36.040
 is a useful resource for just this kind of exploration.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.960
 He doesn't talk down to people

02:37.960 --> 02:40.440
 and he's the most knowledgeable virologist

02:40.440 --> 02:42.040
 I've ever spoken to.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.000
 He has no political agenda,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.240
 no desire to mock those who disagree with him.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.680
 He just loves biology and explaining

02:49.680 --> 02:54.080
 the fundamental mechanisms of how biological systems work.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.760
 That's a great person to listen to

02:55.760 --> 02:58.040
 and learn from with an open mind.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.920
 I hope you join me in doing so

02:59.920 --> 03:02.680
 and no matter what, try to put more love

03:02.680 --> 03:03.800
 out there in the world.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.560
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

03:06.560 --> 03:10.000
 and here is my conversation with Vincent Racken Yellow.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.520
 You mentioned in one of your lectures on virology

03:14.520 --> 03:17.920
 that there are more viruses in a liter of coastal seawater

03:17.920 --> 03:19.640
 than people on earth.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.720
 In the Nature article titled,

03:23.720 --> 03:25.600
 Microbiology by Numbers,

03:25.600 --> 03:29.640
 it says there are 10 to the 31 viruses on earth.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.640
 Also it says that the rate of viral infection

03:33.640 --> 03:38.640
 in the ocean stands at 10 to the 23 infections per second.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.480
 And these infections remove 20 to 40%

03:42.480 --> 03:45.200
 of all bacterial cells each day.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.200
 There's a war going on.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.280
 Do you, what do you make of these numbers?

03:50.280 --> 03:52.400
 Why are there so many viruses?

03:52.400 --> 03:54.600
 So the numbers you're quoting,

03:54.600 --> 03:57.920
 they're in my first virology lecture, right?

03:57.920 --> 04:00.720
 Cause people don't know these numbers

04:00.720 --> 04:02.560
 and they get wow, they get wowed by them.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.200
 So I love to give them.

04:04.200 --> 04:08.680
 Sorry to interrupt, but as I was saying offline,

04:08.680 --> 04:10.880
 you have one of the best introductory lectures

04:10.880 --> 04:13.560
 on virology that I've ever seen,

04:13.560 --> 04:14.800
 introductory lectures periods.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.480
 I highly recommend people find you on YouTube and watch it.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.520
 If you're curious at all about viruses,

04:20.520 --> 04:24.960
 it, yeah, there's a lot of times throughout watching it,

04:24.960 --> 04:26.520
 I felt like, whoa.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.320
 Yeah, that's my goal is to,

04:28.320 --> 04:29.840
 and that's what my students tell me.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.280
 One student once said, every day after every lecture,

04:33.280 --> 04:36.000
 I could go home and tell my roommate something

04:36.000 --> 04:38.880
 she didn't know and blew her away.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.120
 So the number of viruses is really an amazing number.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.240
 So that number 10 to the 31 is actually

04:45.240 --> 04:48.840
 just the bacterial viruses in the ocean.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.480
 So there are viruses that infect everything on the planet,

04:51.480 --> 04:54.840
 including bacteria, there are a lot of bacteria in the ocean.

04:54.840 --> 04:58.320
 And so 10 to the 31 is from basically particle counts

04:58.320 --> 05:00.240
 of seawater all over the world.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.600
 So there are more viruses than 10 to the 31,

05:02.600 --> 05:04.280
 but just in the ocean.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.920
 And that number is so big.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.360
 First of all, the mass exceeds that of elephants

05:10.360 --> 05:12.920
 on the planet by 1,000 fold.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.920
 And if you lined up those viruses end to end,

05:15.920 --> 05:19.800
 they would go 200 million light years into space.

05:19.800 --> 05:23.080
 It's so big a number, it's amazing.

05:23.080 --> 05:27.640
 And then yes, 10 to the 20 some infections per second

05:27.640 --> 05:30.320
 of these viruses killing bacteria

05:30.320 --> 05:32.760
 and releasing all this organic matter.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.560
 And that's part of this,

05:34.560 --> 05:37.280
 what we call the biogeochemical pump,

05:37.280 --> 05:39.760
 cycling of material in the ocean,

05:39.760 --> 05:42.680
 the bacteria die, they start to sink

05:42.680 --> 05:46.440
 and then they get metabolized and converted

05:46.440 --> 05:48.240
 to compounds that are needed.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.000
 A lot of it gets released as carbon dioxide and so forth.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.880
 So these are actually really important cycles

05:52.880 --> 05:54.560
 that are catalyzed by the virus.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.400
 Well, it's so wild that nature has developed

05:56.400 --> 05:59.760
 a mechanism for mass murder of bacteria.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.920
 That's one way to look at it,

06:00.920 --> 06:02.880
 but it's just what happened, right?

06:02.880 --> 06:03.720
 It's interesting.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.480
 I mean, I wonder what the evolutionary advantage

06:06.480 --> 06:10.920
 of such fast cycling of life is.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.480
 Is it just an accident of evolution

06:13.480 --> 06:16.320
 that viruses are so numerous?

06:16.320 --> 06:20.920
 Or is it a feature, not a bug?

06:20.920 --> 06:25.440
 So the fast is, it does not all fast,

06:25.440 --> 06:26.760
 not all viruses are fast.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.840
 Some are 20 minutes per cycle,

06:28.840 --> 06:31.840
 some take weeks per cycle.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.720
 But that's just per second.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.680
 There's so many viruses in the ocean

06:36.680 --> 06:37.960
 that that's what you get per second,

06:37.960 --> 06:40.360
 no matter how fast the cycle is.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.840
 But I look at it this way.

06:42.840 --> 06:47.080
 Viruses were probably the first organic entities

06:47.080 --> 06:49.040
 to evolve on the planet.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.880
 Long ago, billions, billion years ago,

06:51.880 --> 06:56.440
 just as the earth cooled and organic molecules began to form,

06:56.440 --> 07:01.440
 I think these self, we call them self replicators.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.720
 They're just short things that today

07:03.720 --> 07:05.000
 would look like RNA,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.800
 which is the basis of many viruses, right?

07:08.800 --> 07:10.840
 They evolved and they were able to replicate.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.240
 Of course, they were just naked molecules.

07:13.240 --> 07:17.120
 They had no protection and it was just RNA based.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.840
 And that's tough because RNA is pretty fragile

07:19.840 --> 07:23.840
 in the world and it probably didn't get very big

07:23.840 --> 07:25.520
 as a consequence.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.200
 But then proteins evolved

07:28.200 --> 07:30.560
 and I'm skipping like hundreds of millions of years

07:30.560 --> 07:32.480
 of evolution, proteins evolved,

07:32.480 --> 07:36.080
 maybe without a cell, maybe with a cell.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.920
 But then to make a cell,

07:38.920 --> 07:41.440
 there probably were some RNA based cells early on,

07:41.440 --> 07:42.920
 but they were pretty simple.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.480
 But the cells that we know of today,

07:44.480 --> 07:48.040
 even bacteria and single cell eukaryotes,

07:49.040 --> 07:51.400
 they have very long DNA genomes.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.040
 And you need a lot of DNA to make a complicated cell.

07:55.040 --> 08:00.040
 And so we think at some point, the RNA became DNA

08:00.040 --> 08:04.120
 and probably one of the earliest enzymes that arose

08:04.120 --> 08:06.520
 is the enzyme that could copy that RNA into DNA,

08:06.520 --> 08:09.080
 which we now know today as reverse transcriptase,

08:09.080 --> 08:11.600
 which my former boss, David Baltimore

08:11.600 --> 08:14.200
 and Howard Timmons at CoDiscovered.

08:14.200 --> 08:19.200
 And that enzyme arose and copied RNA to DNA

08:19.440 --> 08:22.120
 and then you could build big cells with,

08:22.120 --> 08:25.080
 because DNA can be millions and millions of bases in length.

08:25.080 --> 08:30.080
 And RNA, the longest RNA we know of is 40,000 bases,

08:30.800 --> 08:32.960
 not much bigger than the SARS CoV2.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.280
 What would you say is the magic moment along that line?

08:36.280 --> 08:40.000
 I saw it was one or two billion,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.920
 maybe three billion years it took

08:43.920 --> 08:48.920
 to go from bacteria to complex organism.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.480
 Like it seems like Earth had a very long time,

08:52.480 --> 08:56.080
 like not a very long time without life,

08:56.080 --> 08:58.840
 and then a very long time with very primitive life.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.360
 Maybe I'm discriminating,

09:01.360 --> 09:03.280
 calling bacteria primitive life.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.240
 People would object to you doing that for sure.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.880
 But it seems like complex organism,

09:07.880 --> 09:11.120
 when it starts becoming something like,

09:11.120 --> 09:13.360
 I don't know what's a good, not animal like,

09:13.360 --> 09:16.960
 but more complexity than just like a single cell.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.080
 What do you think is the magic there?

09:20.080 --> 09:21.080
 What's the hardest thing?

09:21.080 --> 09:23.680
 If you were trying to engineer Earth and build life

09:23.680 --> 09:25.160
 and build the simulations,

09:25.160 --> 09:27.960
 obviously we're living in a video game, what this is.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.200
 So if you were trying to build this video,

09:29.200 --> 09:31.920
 what's the hardest part along this evolution path?

09:31.920 --> 09:36.160
 So bacteria are mostly single cells.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.600
 They do make colonies,

09:37.600 --> 09:39.240
 they get together in biofilms,

09:39.240 --> 09:41.240
 which are really important,

09:41.240 --> 09:43.920
 but they're all single bacteria in that.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.840
 And the key is making an organism

09:46.840 --> 09:49.440
 where cells do different things.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.840
 We have skin cells and eye cells and brain cells.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.400
 Bacteria never do that.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.640
 And the reason is probably energy.

09:55.640 --> 09:59.000
 Bacteria can't make enough energy to do that.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.560
 And so there was another cell existing at the time,

10:03.560 --> 10:04.400
 the archaea.

10:06.200 --> 10:10.280
 And the idea is that a bacteria went into an archaea

10:10.280 --> 10:13.240
 and became the modern day mitochondria,

10:13.240 --> 10:15.080
 the energy factory of the cell.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.560
 And that now led that cell

10:17.560 --> 10:19.960
 to develop into more and more complicated organisms

10:19.960 --> 10:20.800
 like we have today.

10:20.800 --> 10:21.880
 It was all about energy.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.600
 So the mitochondria, the energy,

10:24.600 --> 10:26.520
 the mitochondria is the magic thing.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.360
 I think so.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.520
 It's actually not my idea, it's Nick Jones.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.680
 Have you heard of Nick Jones?

10:30.680 --> 10:33.560
 He's an evolutionary biologist in the UK.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.480
 And he's done experimental work on this.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.360
 And it's his idea that the defining point was

10:40.360 --> 10:41.880
 the ability to make a lot of energy,

10:41.880 --> 10:43.160
 which a mitochondria can do.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.320
 It's basically a whole bacteria inside of a bigger cell.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.320
 And that becomes what we now call eukaryotes

10:48.320 --> 10:51.720
 and that they can get more and more complicated.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.240
 So let me bring you back to the viruses.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.400
 I wanna finish that story.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.360
 Yeah, which points of virus has come along?

10:56.360 --> 10:58.880
 So remember, we have these precellular,

10:58.880 --> 11:01.560
 they're called precellular replicons, right?

11:01.560 --> 11:05.280
 And so we have a precellular stage

11:05.280 --> 11:08.800
 where we have these self replicating molecules

11:08.800 --> 11:13.800
 and cells arise and then the self replicating molecules

11:13.800 --> 11:16.120
 invade the cells, why?

11:16.120 --> 11:18.000
 Because it's a hospitable environment.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.280
 I mean, they didn't know that.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.600
 They just went in and it turned out

11:20.600 --> 11:23.560
 it was beneficial for them, so it's stuck.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.640
 And they replicate inside the cell now

11:25.640 --> 11:27.520
 where they have pools of everything they need.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.280
 They get more and more complicated.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.920
 And then they steal proteins from the cell

11:31.920 --> 11:34.280
 to build a protective shell.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.960
 And then they can be released as virus particles

11:36.960 --> 11:39.960
 are now protected, they can move from host to host.

11:39.960 --> 11:44.320
 And because they're at the earliest stages of cellular

11:44.320 --> 11:47.680
 evolution, they can diversify to infect anything

11:47.680 --> 11:48.520
 that arises.

11:48.520 --> 11:52.360
 And that is why I think there's so many of them

11:52.360 --> 11:54.600
 and everything on the planet is infected

11:54.600 --> 11:56.120
 because the ancestor of everything

11:56.120 --> 11:57.520
 was infected many years ago.

11:57.520 --> 12:01.720
 So it's easier to steal than to build from scratch.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.800
 So like it's easier to sort of break into

12:03.800 --> 12:06.440
 somebody else's thing and steal their proteins.

12:06.440 --> 12:11.400
 Yes, my colleague Dixon de Palmier calls viruses safecrackers.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.720
 Safecrackers.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.840
 So it's just from an evolutionary perspective,

12:15.840 --> 12:20.720
 it's easier to steal because you can select.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.320
 But then you have to figure out mechanisms for stealing,

12:23.320 --> 12:25.680
 for breaking into, for cracking the safe.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.560
 Well, you don't have to figure out, it just happens, right?

12:28.560 --> 12:30.920
 Because molecules are so diverse

12:30.920 --> 12:33.360
 that a molecule gets into a cell.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.760
 And if there's a protein that sticks to it,

12:35.760 --> 12:39.400
 it's gonna stick and that gives an advantage.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.160
 There's no, you know, there's no planning,

12:41.160 --> 12:43.080
 there's no thinking about it, right?

12:43.080 --> 12:45.040
 It just happens.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.400
 Oh, we'll return to that.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.840
 What, but these numbers are crazy.

12:50.840 --> 12:55.880
 So what, as these more complex organisms evolved,

12:55.880 --> 12:58.000
 let's take us humans as an example,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.360
 should we be afraid of these high numbers?

13:01.360 --> 13:03.400
 Should we be worried that there's so many viruses

13:03.400 --> 13:04.240
 in the world?

13:04.240 --> 13:07.440
 Well, to a certain extent, I mean, they have,

13:07.440 --> 13:09.320
 it's twofold, they're good and bad, right?

13:09.320 --> 13:12.040
 Viruses are no, there's no question they can be bad.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.080
 We know that because they've infected

13:14.080 --> 13:15.480
 and cause disease throughout history.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.880
 But we're also, you and I are full of viruses

13:17.880 --> 13:20.200
 that don't hurt us at all and probably help us.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.000
 And every organism is the same.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.880
 So they are clearly beneficial as a consequence.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.880
 So I think, so every living thing on the planet

13:31.000 --> 13:33.600
 has multiple viruses infecting.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.760
 Everything you can see.

13:35.760 --> 13:39.560
 And most of them, I think we don't worry about

13:39.560 --> 13:42.120
 because they can't infect us, they're unable.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.640
 In fact, now you could actually,

13:44.640 --> 13:47.040
 you can actually take your feces and send them to a company

13:47.040 --> 13:50.000
 and they will sequence your viruses in your feces for you,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.240
 your fecal viral, right?

13:52.240 --> 13:57.240
 And the most common virus in human feces

13:57.720 --> 14:00.520
 is a plant virus that infects peppers.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.160
 It's called pepper model mosaic virus.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.040
 And that's cause people eat a lot of peppers.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.680
 And it just passes right through you.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.200
 Cabbage is full of viruses from the insects

14:09.200 --> 14:10.920
 that walk on the cabbage in the fields.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.160
 We eat them, they just pass us.

14:13.160 --> 14:16.400
 So I think most of the viruses we don't need to worry about

14:16.400 --> 14:19.520
 except when we're talking about species

14:19.520 --> 14:23.200
 that are closest to us, mammals, of course.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.560
 I think the most numerous ones are the most concerning.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.240
 They're viruses like bats, bats are 20% of mammals

14:30.240 --> 14:33.480
 and rodents are 40% of mammals.

14:33.480 --> 14:37.080
 And we humans live nearby, right?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.600
 And we know throughout history,

14:38.600 --> 14:40.080
 many viruses have come from bats

14:40.080 --> 14:41.480
 and from rodents to people.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.320
 No question about it.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.600
 So there's a proximity in terms of just living together

14:44.600 --> 14:46.240
 and a proximity genetically too.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.400
 So it's more like that a virus will jump from a bat

14:49.400 --> 14:50.240
 and a rodent.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.080
 And birds too.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.920
 Birds can give us their viruses that's happened.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.120
 Influenza viruses come from birds mainly.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.680
 So I think those are the three species,

15:00.680 --> 15:02.720
 not species, it's higher than species obviously,

15:02.720 --> 15:04.280
 but those are the three I would worry about

15:04.280 --> 15:06.000
 in terms of getting their viruses.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.560
 And we don't really know what's out there, right?

15:09.560 --> 15:12.520
 We have very little clue about what viruses.

15:12.520 --> 15:16.520
 And I've for years wanted to capture wild mice

15:16.520 --> 15:18.680
 in my backyard and see what viruses they have

15:18.680 --> 15:19.640
 because no one knows.

15:21.000 --> 15:21.840
 And it's an easy...

15:21.840 --> 15:22.680
 We can't ask them.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.160
 So you mean map, like is there a way to ask them?

15:25.160 --> 15:26.960
 No, I would have to sacrifice them

15:26.960 --> 15:29.080
 and take tissue and then bring it in the lab

15:29.080 --> 15:30.120
 and do genome sequencing.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.200
 So you can do a thorough sequencing

15:32.200 --> 15:33.840
 to determine your viruses.

15:33.840 --> 15:37.440
 Is there a sufficiently good categorization of viruses

15:37.440 --> 15:38.280
 where you'd be...

15:38.280 --> 15:40.120
 That's a very good question.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.680
 So whenever you do sequence, right?

15:42.680 --> 15:44.200
 You get some environmental sample

15:44.200 --> 15:47.160
 and you extract nucleic acid and you sequence it.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.720
 What you do is you run it past the database.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.160
 The gold standard is the GenBank database,

15:52.160 --> 15:54.400
 which is maintained here in the US.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.640
 And you see if you get any hits.

15:56.640 --> 15:57.880
 And then you can say,

15:57.880 --> 16:01.080
 ah, look, this sequence is similar to this virus.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.560
 And you can classify all the viruses you see.

16:03.560 --> 16:08.560
 The problem is 90% of your sequence is dark matter.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.120
 It doesn't hit with anything.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.480
 It's probably a lot of it is unknown viruses.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.080
 And that's gonna be hard to figure out

16:16.080 --> 16:17.640
 because someone's gonna have to go after it

16:17.640 --> 16:18.960
 and sort it through.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.600
 So yes, you can find a lot of viruses.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.960
 And the numbers you get are astounding.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.160
 You can find thousands of new viruses

16:25.160 --> 16:28.120
 just by looking in various life forms.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.360
 But there are many more that we don't pick up

16:30.360 --> 16:32.080
 because they're not in the database.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.080
 Maybe this is a good time to take a quick tangent.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.000
 What do you think about AlphaFold too?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.240
 I don't know if you've been paying attention to that.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.840
 But then my deep mind,

16:41.840 --> 16:44.160
 solving the protein folding problem.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.600
 And then also releasing,

16:46.600 --> 16:49.080
 first of all, open sourcing the code,

16:49.080 --> 16:52.200
 which is for me as a software person, I love.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.160
 And then second of all, also making like $300,000

16:56.160 --> 16:57.840
 in predictions or something like that

16:57.840 --> 17:01.480
 for different protein structures and releasing that data.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.720
 On the side of, because you're saying there's dark matter.

17:07.720 --> 17:11.440
 Is there something, first,

17:11.440 --> 17:12.960
 what are your general thoughts,

17:12.960 --> 17:15.960
 level of excitement about their work?

17:15.960 --> 17:19.440
 And second, how can that be applied to viruses?

17:19.440 --> 17:21.680
 Do you think we'll be able to explore the dark matter

17:21.680 --> 17:24.400
 of virology using machine learning?

17:24.400 --> 17:25.240
 Yeah, absolutely.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.800
 Because in all this dark sequence,

17:26.800 --> 17:29.880
 you can translate it and make a protein.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.480
 You can see what a protein looks like.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.000
 It has what we call an open reading frame, right?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.280
 A start and a stop.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.520
 And right now it's just a bunch of amino acids.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.800
 But if we could fold it,

17:39.800 --> 17:43.200
 maybe the fold would be like something we already know.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.480
 Some protein fold, which gives you a lot of clues, right?

17:46.480 --> 17:49.640
 Because there are only so many protein folds in biology.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.600
 And that dark matter is probably one of them.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.200
 So I think that's very exciting because for years,

17:55.200 --> 17:59.560
 I followed structural biologists for years.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.960
 And in the beginning,

18:01.960 --> 18:04.000
 we couldn't even solve structures of viruses.

18:04.000 --> 18:04.840
 They're too big.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.720
 We could do small molecules like myoglobin.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.400
 That was the first one done, took years to do that.

18:09.400 --> 18:13.040
 Then as computational power increased,

18:13.040 --> 18:14.720
 then they could start to do viruses.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.760
 But it took a long time.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.400
 X ray crystallography,

18:18.400 --> 18:21.520
 depending on getting crystals of the virus, right?

18:21.520 --> 18:24.440
 And now we can do cryoelectron microscopy,

18:24.440 --> 18:26.360
 which is much faster.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.640
 You could solve a spike of SARS CoV2

18:28.640 --> 18:31.400
 was solved in two months by Jason McClelland here

18:31.400 --> 18:34.840
 in Austin actually at the beginning of the pandemic.

18:34.840 --> 18:35.760
 But you're limited.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.760
 You can't do huge proteins.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.160
 You can only do moderately sized ones.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.480
 So, or actually you can do viruses,

18:45.480 --> 18:47.000
 but you can't do small proteins.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.080
 So that's speeded it up, but it's still too fast

18:50.080 --> 18:51.680
 to solve, you get a new protein,

18:51.680 --> 18:52.720
 you wanna solve its structure.

18:52.720 --> 18:53.840
 So if we could predict it,

18:53.840 --> 18:55.960
 and I know from talking to structural biologists,

18:55.960 --> 18:58.320
 this has been their holy grail from day one.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.880
 They wanna be able to take a sequence of a protein,

19:00.880 --> 19:03.320
 put it in a computer and have the structure put out

19:03.320 --> 19:05.200
 without having to do all the experiment.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.840
 So that's why this is very exciting

19:06.840 --> 19:08.560
 that you can predict it.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.800
 That mean it's not finished, obviously,

19:10.800 --> 19:11.840
 and there's more to do.

19:11.840 --> 19:12.960
 But I think it will be a day

19:12.960 --> 19:15.560
 where you could take any amino acid sequence

19:15.560 --> 19:17.320
 and predict what it's gonna look like.

19:17.320 --> 19:20.400
 See, but aren't structural biologists gonna get greedy?

19:20.400 --> 19:21.720
 So once you have that,

19:21.720 --> 19:24.040
 don't you wanna go more complicated then?

19:24.040 --> 19:25.440
 Don't you wanna go,

19:25.440 --> 19:27.640
 because that's just the first step, right?

19:27.640 --> 19:29.480
 To go from amino acid to structure,

19:29.480 --> 19:32.120
 and there's multiple protein interactions.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.400
 Like, how do you get to the virus?

19:34.400 --> 19:37.040
 Well, so that's what the ultimate goal

19:37.040 --> 19:38.240
 of getting a structure is,

19:38.240 --> 19:39.680
 that then you can do experiments

19:39.680 --> 19:42.400
 and figure out what the structure means, right?

19:42.400 --> 19:46.160
 So many, in the old days, structural biology

19:46.160 --> 19:48.160
 was a career in itself.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.000
 You worked with people who had a system

19:50.000 --> 19:51.360
 and just solved proteins for them,

19:51.360 --> 19:52.520
 and then you moved on to another one.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.200
 You didn't really do any experiments.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.200
 The other people got to do

19:55.200 --> 19:57.000
 all the interesting experiments.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
 Now, young structural biologists are multifaceted.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.640
 They solve the structure,

20:03.640 --> 20:04.480
 and then they say,

20:04.480 --> 20:06.560
 what happens if we change this amino acid?

20:06.560 --> 20:09.000
 Oh, look, it blocks binding to the receptor.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.240
 This must be the receptor binding interface.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.680
 So that's the exciting stuff,

20:12.680 --> 20:14.480
 absolutely, is doing the experiments.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.800
 I wonder if you can do some kinds of simulations

20:18.800 --> 20:23.800
 of different proteins or multi protein systems

20:24.640 --> 20:26.360
 going to war against each other.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.400
 Like, to try to figure out,

20:31.400 --> 20:34.840
 reinforcement learning is used in AlphaZero,

20:34.840 --> 20:36.960
 for example, to learn chess and go,

20:36.960 --> 20:39.200
 and that's using the self play mechanism

20:39.200 --> 20:40.960
 where the thing plays against itself.

20:40.960 --> 20:41.800
 Sure.

20:41.800 --> 20:42.760
 And learns better and better.

20:42.760 --> 20:43.840
 Whether you can,

20:43.840 --> 20:46.680
 I wonder if you can simulate almost evolution in that way

20:46.680 --> 20:49.560
 for primitive biological systems,

20:49.560 --> 20:52.600
 have them in simulation, fight each other,

20:52.600 --> 20:53.640
 and then see what comes out,

20:53.640 --> 20:55.680
 like a super dangerous virus comes out,

20:55.680 --> 20:58.480
 or super Chuck Norris type of thing

20:58.480 --> 21:00.640
 that defends against the super dangerous virus,

21:00.640 --> 21:01.840
 and it's all in simulation.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.960
 So an example would be,

21:03.960 --> 21:07.840
 we have all these variants of SARS CoV2 arising, right?

21:07.840 --> 21:12.840
 Which look to be selected by immune responses.

21:13.080 --> 21:17.280
 But we know what amino acids are changing in the spike,

21:17.280 --> 21:19.080
 and how they block antibody bonding.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.320
 You could simulate that.

21:20.320 --> 21:24.960
 You could say, what is the antibody looking at?

21:24.960 --> 21:28.040
 Where antibodies bind on proteins are called epitopes, right?

21:28.040 --> 21:30.360
 You could map them all and change them in a simulation,

21:30.360 --> 21:32.080
 one by one, and go back and forth

21:32.080 --> 21:33.760
 between the antibody and the virus.

21:33.760 --> 21:38.360
 So all these, evolution is what we call an arms race, right?

21:38.360 --> 21:41.560
 The virus changes, and then it evades the host,

21:41.560 --> 21:43.200
 and then the host can change.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.200
 The host takes longer to change though, unfortunately.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.920
 It takes geological time, but it can,

21:47.920 --> 21:49.600
 and then the virus can change,

21:49.600 --> 21:50.560
 and it can go back and forth.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.840
 And we can see evidence of this

21:52.840 --> 21:56.200
 in genome sequences of both viruses and their hosts.

21:56.200 --> 22:00.000
 And so you can take a protein in a host

22:00.000 --> 22:02.680
 that is a receptor for multiple viruses,

22:02.680 --> 22:05.680
 and you can see all the impacts of virus pressure on it,

22:05.680 --> 22:07.240
 and you could simulate that for sure.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.960
 And that's just one thing that you could do.

22:08.960 --> 22:13.640
 You could simulate changes in, say, an enzyme

22:13.640 --> 22:15.080
 that makes it resistant to a drug,

22:15.080 --> 22:17.080
 and predict all the drug resistance.

22:18.200 --> 22:21.240
 But the problem is, people like me,

22:21.240 --> 22:22.760
 the experimental virologists,

22:22.760 --> 22:24.000
 don't know how to do any of that,

22:24.000 --> 22:27.680
 so we need to collaborate with people, I guess.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.640
 All with other humans.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.440
 We do that, we do that.

22:31.440 --> 22:35.680
 But with people from a field that we're not used to,

22:35.680 --> 22:39.040
 I suppose people who, would it be AI, I suppose?

22:39.040 --> 22:40.000
 Yeah, machine learning people.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.040
 Machine learning people, and you would say,

22:42.040 --> 22:44.360
 look, this is the biological problem.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.880
 Is there a way we can use your tools to attack it?

22:46.880 --> 22:51.360
 The problem is those people are antisocial introverts

22:51.360 --> 22:55.080
 that have a place like this,

22:55.080 --> 22:57.160
 and try to hide from other people in the world.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.120
 Very difficult to find in the wild.

22:59.120 --> 23:04.120
 Okay, so outside of doing amazing, brilliant lectures online,

23:04.880 --> 23:09.880
 you host and produce five, I would say, related podcasts,

23:10.920 --> 23:14.480
 including my favorite, This Week in virology,

23:14.480 --> 23:17.080
 also This Week in parasitism,

23:17.080 --> 23:19.440
 This Week in microbiology, and so on.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.880
 So you're a good person to ask,

23:21.880 --> 23:24.680
 what are the categories of small things,

23:24.680 --> 23:28.080
 small biological things in this world that can kill you?

23:28.080 --> 23:29.600
 Kill us humans.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.080
 Let's look, you said like most viruses are friendly,

23:34.080 --> 23:36.520
 or at least not unfriendly,

23:36.520 --> 23:39.680
 but let's look at the unfriendly ones,

23:39.680 --> 23:42.200
 in viruses and bacteria and those kinds of things.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.000
 When you look at the full spectrum of things

23:44.000 --> 23:47.280
 that can kill you, can you kind of paint a brief picture?

23:47.280 --> 23:50.760
 Yeah, I think the big picture is that

23:50.760 --> 23:52.800
 the things that can kill you are a minority

23:52.800 --> 23:54.400
 of everything that's out there.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.280
 And we're talking about molecules.

23:57.280 --> 24:01.360
 So we have in us proteins that can kill us,

24:01.360 --> 24:04.600
 preons that are just, it's a protein in us.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.720
 And if it misfolds,

24:05.720 --> 24:08.720
 it makes all of its other copies misfold,

24:08.720 --> 24:11.720
 and then you die of a neurological disease.

24:11.720 --> 24:12.720
 That's pretty rare.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.520
 So there are proteins that are viruses.

24:16.520 --> 24:20.240
 And as I said, only certain ones can kill us.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.000
 But even if we get those from animals,

24:23.000 --> 24:24.480
 it's not straightforward.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.800
 If you look at SARS CoV2,

24:26.800 --> 24:29.920
 this is probably a once in a hundred year pandemic,

24:29.920 --> 24:34.800
 I would say, equivalent to 1918 in its devastation.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.600
 And in between there have been smaller pandemics

24:36.600 --> 24:39.640
 of other viruses, but it doesn't happen all that often.

24:39.640 --> 24:40.600
 So we have a lot of viruses.

24:40.600 --> 24:43.640
 We have a lot of bacteria of various sorts

24:43.640 --> 24:46.280
 that can cause infections in us.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.280
 And it's a limited number, right?

24:49.280 --> 24:52.720
 You're streptococci and staphylococci and clostridia.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.120
 We could go on and on,

24:54.120 --> 24:56.760
 but we know how to handle those as long

24:56.760 --> 24:58.320
 as we have antimicrobials.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.440
 It's just that we abuse them and we get resistance.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.160
 So that can be a problem.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.880
 Then we have fungi, not mushrooms,

25:04.880 --> 25:09.480
 but much smaller fungi that multiply the submicroscopic

25:09.480 --> 25:11.440
 or just at the microscopic level,

25:11.440 --> 25:13.960
 they can, you know, in dry climates of the US,

25:13.960 --> 25:15.200
 you can inhale their spores

25:15.200 --> 25:16.320
 and they can grow in your lung

25:16.320 --> 25:18.840
 if you're immunosuppressed and so forth.

25:18.840 --> 25:21.080
 So those are the tiny guys.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.360
 And then we have parasites,

25:22.360 --> 25:25.040
 which we do this week in parasitism,

25:25.040 --> 25:30.040
 where single cells, even worms of various sorts,

25:30.120 --> 25:33.680
 can invade you and cause all sorts of problems.

25:33.680 --> 25:37.240
 How, I was kind of terrified to listen to that podcast.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.680
 What's it like?

25:39.680 --> 25:44.680
 Well, I mean, what you learn is that you can,

25:45.240 --> 25:47.240
 you travel somewhere and you can get infected

25:47.240 --> 25:48.240
 and bring it back home.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.080
 Yes.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.640
 In the US, we do have certain kinds of parasites,

25:52.640 --> 25:55.000
 but because of our lifestyle,

25:55.000 --> 25:56.600
 we more or less have avoided them.

25:56.600 --> 26:00.440
 For example, there is a parasite called toxoplasma,

26:00.440 --> 26:03.960
 which is infected most of the world actually,

26:03.960 --> 26:06.160
 because a lot of people like to eat raw meat

26:06.160 --> 26:08.400
 and you would get it from raw meat.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.320
 And we're not as fond of that here in the US.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.320
 We like to cook our meat,

26:13.320 --> 26:16.440
 but that could be a consequence of eating raw meat.

26:16.440 --> 26:19.840
 Is that what leads to what is it called, toxoplasmosis?

26:19.840 --> 26:20.680
 Yeah.

26:20.680 --> 26:25.680
 So toxoplasmosis, it's mainly a big issue

26:26.320 --> 26:28.400
 is if you're pregnant and you get toxa,

26:28.400 --> 26:32.520
 then your fetus is gonna be very badly malformed.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.000
 It's gonna have brain defects and so forth.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.480
 And animals can get it as well.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.280
 So there are a lot of parasites of that nature,

26:41.280 --> 26:43.280
 which you often acquire by food,

26:43.280 --> 26:45.000
 eating food of different sorts.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.760
 And it usually happens elsewhere.

26:46.760 --> 26:50.840
 We just, on this week in parasitism, we do a case.

26:50.840 --> 26:54.320
 So Daniel Griffin is a resident physician.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.480
 He's a doctor, a real doctor, right?

26:56.480 --> 26:58.640
 And every month he comes up with a case.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.880
 Okay, this is a person I saw.

27:00.880 --> 27:04.960
 And last month, this young lady had traveled somewhere

27:04.960 --> 27:09.600
 and she ate raw fish.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.920
 It was somewhere Southeast Asia or something.

27:11.920 --> 27:15.880
 And she ended up with red bumps all over her skin.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.720
 And it turned out it was a parasite from the fish

27:17.720 --> 27:19.840
 that moved around in her.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.720
 And very easy to cure.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.720
 We have the right doctors and the right drugs.

27:23.720 --> 27:24.560
 You can cure all these.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.600
 What about diagnosed, like connect the red spots

27:27.600 --> 27:28.800
 to the fact that it's a parasite?

27:28.800 --> 27:31.280
 Very easy to, if you have the right diagnostics.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.120
 Now Daniel often goes to parts of the world

27:33.120 --> 27:34.560
 where they don't have diagnostics

27:34.560 --> 27:37.240
 and he has to use other mechanisms.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.320
 He may have to take a bit and look under a microscope.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.960
 And then he may not be able to get the drug

27:41.960 --> 27:43.840
 depending on where he is.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.160
 But often he sees patients who come back to the U.S.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.640
 and they get diarrhea or they have a fever.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.720
 And he said, where have you been?

27:50.720 --> 27:52.200
 And he can put two and two together.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.800
 And so we let our listeners do that

27:53.800 --> 27:55.240
 and they all send in guesses.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.840
 And it's wonderful to hear them go through this.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.160
 So there are a lot of parasites

27:59.160 --> 28:00.760
 that can get you.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.400
 You have to be careful about eating when you go overseas.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.640
 And water too?

28:04.640 --> 28:05.520
 Water as well.

28:05.520 --> 28:09.240
 And in parts of Africa, there are parasites in the lakes.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.880
 And if you go swimming, they can invade you.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.120
 And in fact, they can go into your hair follicles

28:14.120 --> 28:16.000
 and burrow in and get into your bloodstream.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
 That's exciting.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.360
 So Daniel is interesting because he's very adventurous

28:20.360 --> 28:22.840
 and he's not afraid of any of this.

28:22.840 --> 28:26.080
 So there's a famous lake in Africa, Lake Malawi,

28:26.080 --> 28:28.520
 which harbors a lot of these parasites.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.320
 And he said, oh yeah, yeah, I just make sure

28:30.320 --> 28:34.920
 I towel off vigorously when I get out and get rid of them.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.200
 And that was the name of an episode.

28:37.200 --> 28:42.200
 But food is, you know, sushi, you can get worms from sushi.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.840
 And the solution is to freeze it.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.920
 And many sushi restaurants now have liquid nitrogen.

28:49.920 --> 28:53.040
 They snap freeze their sushi and that kills all the parasites.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.440
 And a study was actually done in Japan

28:56.440 --> 28:59.280
 showing that freezing does not alter the taste of sushi

28:59.280 --> 29:01.760
 because it's up, you see a big industry there.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.280
 Wow, that's brilliant.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.480
 That's brilliant.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.760
 Yeah, I was thinking about, you know,

29:07.760 --> 29:12.000
 I'm so boring and bland that especially when I'm now

29:12.000 --> 29:14.280
 in Texas here and I've been eating quite a bit of barbecue,

29:14.280 --> 29:18.960
 I realized I really haven't explored the culinary world.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.280
 And I've been curious to travel and taste different foods.

29:22.280 --> 29:25.080
 Is there something you can say by way of advice,

29:26.200 --> 29:28.800
 you know, channeling Daniel, I guess,

29:28.800 --> 29:31.080
 if you were to travel in the world,

29:31.080 --> 29:34.600
 if eating is the thing that gets you the parasites,

29:34.600 --> 29:37.080
 what's a good advice for eating

29:37.080 --> 29:39.240
 in strange parts of the world?

29:39.240 --> 29:41.800
 Mongolia, India, China,

29:41.800 --> 29:43.880
 is there something you could say by way of advice?

29:43.880 --> 29:45.240
 I think Daniel would say,

29:45.240 --> 29:47.560
 make sure your food is cooked, right?

29:47.560 --> 29:49.080
 Cooked, but that's so boring.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.480
 Yeah, it's unfortunate.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.240
 And he would agree with you

29:52.240 --> 29:55.560
 because, you know, many vegetables are delicious.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.880
 Salads even are delicious, not cooked,

29:57.880 --> 29:59.560
 but they can have parasites in them.

29:59.560 --> 30:04.320
 Meats, fish, people like to have uncooked fish.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.080
 So if you want to be really safe and boring,

30:06.080 --> 30:07.960
 just make sure everything is cooked.

30:07.960 --> 30:12.960
 Now we have a case this week on TWIP of a young man who went,

30:13.280 --> 30:15.640
 I forgot where he went, but he stayed in a hotel.

30:15.640 --> 30:19.360
 I think he, oh, Oaxaca, Mexico, stayed in a hotel.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.760
 And he came back with diarrhea and fever.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.560
 And he said, I don't know, I stayed in the hotel,

30:26.560 --> 30:29.160
 I just ate hotel food, lots of vegetables

30:29.160 --> 30:31.920
 and fruits and probably they weren't washed

30:31.920 --> 30:34.880
 with clean water, you know, he got something from that.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.520
 The bottom line is most of these infections

30:38.520 --> 30:40.240
 with parasites can be diagnosed

30:40.240 --> 30:42.720
 and you can be treated and you'll be fine.

30:42.720 --> 30:47.560
 So if you really want to experience the cuisine,

30:47.560 --> 30:49.280
 I don't think you should worry about it.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.720
 That's what Daniel would say.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.000
 Let's return to the basics.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.880
 We can then jump around all over the place.

30:54.880 --> 30:58.760
 What are the basic principles of virology?

30:58.760 --> 31:02.200
 Maybe a good place to start is what is a virus?

31:02.200 --> 31:03.640
 That's great.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.160
 I mean, I talk in my first lecture

31:05.160 --> 31:07.520
 for 20 minutes before I get to that.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.080
 But, and I wonder if I should put it up front,

31:10.080 --> 31:12.120
 but it's kind of a boring definition.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.880
 So if you do that, first people will turn off.

31:14.880 --> 31:17.080
 So first you tell them about all the millions

31:17.080 --> 31:18.960
 and billions of viruses around.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.760
 So a virus, we have a very specific definition

31:22.760 --> 31:26.440
 because it's different from everything else on the planet.

31:26.440 --> 31:29.000
 Because first of all, it's a parasite.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.080
 It takes, a parasite means you take something

31:32.080 --> 31:33.800
 from someone else.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.200
 You know, we have human parasites

31:35.200 --> 31:36.880
 who take money from others, right?

31:36.880 --> 31:38.880
 But in biological terms,

31:38.880 --> 31:41.920
 a parasite takes something from the host

31:41.920 --> 31:44.320
 that the host would otherwise use energy

31:44.320 --> 31:46.240
 or some building block or something like that.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.560
 There's never really a symbiotic relationship

31:48.560 --> 31:50.440
 between a virus and a host.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.000
 Well, there can be.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.960
 So that's the dichotomy I think is that

31:53.960 --> 31:56.680
 we define them as parasites yet.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.760
 I just told you 20 minutes ago

31:58.760 --> 32:01.560
 that many viruses are probably beneficial.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.520
 So I think what it means is at some point

32:04.520 --> 32:06.840
 we're gonna have to change our definition, right?

32:06.840 --> 32:11.840
 Because after all definitions we make are just constructs

32:12.000 --> 32:14.160
 that make it easier for us to study

32:14.160 --> 32:16.800
 that not necessarily represent what's right.

32:16.800 --> 32:20.440
 Yeah, like Pluto was a planet at first

32:20.440 --> 32:21.680
 and now it's not a planet anymore

32:21.680 --> 32:23.360
 and a lot of people are very upset.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.720
 But it's only according to us.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.040
 There may be another race living somewhere else

32:27.040 --> 32:28.520
 who thinks it's a planet, right?

32:28.520 --> 32:30.720
 Well, maybe that's why viruses are attacking humans.

32:30.720 --> 32:31.560
 They're very angry.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.960
 They weren't calling them parasites.

32:33.960 --> 32:38.000
 So right now our definition includes parasite

32:38.000 --> 32:41.400
 because a virus cannot do anything without a cell.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.040
 If this mug were full of viruses

32:44.040 --> 32:46.360
 it would not do anything for years.

32:46.360 --> 32:49.040
 It would eventually probably lose its infectivity

32:49.040 --> 32:50.520
 but it's not gonna reproduce here.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.040
 It needs cells.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.240
 And to the first people who discovered viruses

32:54.240 --> 32:57.360
 that was astounding that they didn't just reproduce

32:57.360 --> 32:59.640
 divide on their own like bacteria.

32:59.640 --> 33:02.640
 So a virus needs to get inside of a cell,

33:02.640 --> 33:03.680
 inside the cell.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.520
 It can't just hang around on the surface.

33:05.520 --> 33:09.200
 It needs to get in in order to make more of itself.

33:09.200 --> 33:13.080
 And so we call it an obligate intracellular parasite

33:13.080 --> 33:15.040
 because it needs to get in a cell

33:15.040 --> 33:17.320
 and then it takes things from the cell

33:17.320 --> 33:20.240
 in the form of all kinds of molecules and processes

33:20.240 --> 33:23.360
 and energy and so forth to make new viruses.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.240
 Obligate means it's obligated to be inside the cell.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.080
 Absolutely.

33:27.080 --> 33:30.800
 It will not reproduce outside of the cell.

33:30.800 --> 33:35.800
 So this mug of viruses can in no way be living

33:35.880 --> 33:36.920
 in my opinion.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.160
 However, once it gets inside of a cell

33:39.160 --> 33:41.240
 now the cell is a virus infected cell.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.320
 It's alive.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.360
 So a virus in my view has two phases, right?

33:45.360 --> 33:48.200
 It's this nonliving particulate phase

33:48.200 --> 33:50.120
 that everyone is used to.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.720
 I'll send you, you need a virus for your table.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.560
 I'll send you a nice model.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.600
 I think it would look good here.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.440
 Yes, definitely.

33:56.440 --> 33:57.840
 You don't have to go with all this other stuff.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.680
 Yeah.

33:58.680 --> 33:59.520
 Well, these are all mechanical,

33:59.520 --> 34:01.240
 there's no biology here.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.480
 So you wouldn't want a virus here?

34:02.480 --> 34:04.000
 No, I'd want a virus, of course.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.880
 I'll send you one and then you can look at it.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.920
 Because now that we have the three dimensional structures

34:09.920 --> 34:12.600
 solved by structural biologists,

34:12.600 --> 34:14.760
 we take the coordinates and we put it in a 3D printer

34:14.760 --> 34:18.840
 and you can make amazing models, right, of any virus.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.520
 And so there's a huge variety of viruses.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.360
 Huge, that we know of,

34:23.360 --> 34:24.880
 which is only a fraction of what's out there.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.800
 What's the categories?

34:25.800 --> 34:27.880
 So there's RNA, there's DNA viruses.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.280
 What are those, what's DNA and RNA?

34:30.280 --> 34:35.280
 Two broad categorizations, RNA and these are genetic material.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.240
 It can be two different chemicals.

34:39.240 --> 34:43.160
 So RNA, everything else on the planet besides viruses

34:43.160 --> 34:45.320
 is all DNA based, you and I are DNA based.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.360
 Everything on the planet today is DNA based

34:47.360 --> 34:50.240
 except some viruses are RNA based.

34:50.240 --> 34:53.160
 And that's because, as I mentioned earlier,

34:53.160 --> 34:57.280
 the first life that arose on the planet was RNA based.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.520
 Yeah, so these are like old school viruses.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.640
 These are old school, we call relics, yeah.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.560
 Relics, and this has got a name,

35:04.560 --> 35:06.800
 it's called the RNA world, which I think is great.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.680
 Is it big still or are they out of the relics dying out?

35:09.680 --> 35:11.560
 Oh no, the relics in my opinion

35:11.560 --> 35:14.920
 are the most successful viruses, the RNA viruses.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.720
 And SARS CoV2 is an RNA virus.

35:16.720 --> 35:19.080
 We can talk about why they're so successful.

35:19.080 --> 35:22.760
 But you have broadly speaking viruses with RNA,

35:22.760 --> 35:24.960
 genetic information, which are relics.

35:24.960 --> 35:26.480
 Of course, they're contemporary.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.920
 They have adapted to the modern world

35:28.920 --> 35:31.160
 and the modern organisms living in it.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.280
 And then we have DNA based viruses,

35:33.280 --> 35:36.480
 which are extremely conservative and slow.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.800
 They're very successful.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.080
 Everyone has a herpes virus infection,

35:40.080 --> 35:44.520
 but they don't get the news like the RNA viruses do,

35:44.520 --> 35:46.800
 the HIV's and the influenza viruses

35:46.800 --> 35:49.080
 and the SARS coronaviruses,

35:49.080 --> 35:51.080
 they get all the press in their RNA based.

35:51.080 --> 35:54.360
 Because RNA lets you change more so than DNA.

35:54.360 --> 35:57.200
 So they evolve much faster, the RNA viruses?

35:57.200 --> 35:58.320
 Much faster.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.920
 And in fact, when I have an electron evolution,

36:01.920 --> 36:04.200
 I don't know if you've listened to that when you should,

36:04.200 --> 36:06.600
 it's really, I think it's really interesting.

36:07.760 --> 36:12.760
 RNA viruses exist at their error threshold,

36:12.760 --> 36:16.520
 which means they can't make any more mutations

36:16.520 --> 36:19.560
 when they reproduce, otherwise they're dead.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.880
 They would go extinct.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.600
 They're evolving at their error threshold.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.280
 DNA viruses are hundreds of times lower

36:26.280 --> 36:28.400
 than their error thresholds.

36:28.400 --> 36:31.120
 And we know this, we can do an experiment to find that out.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.560
 And now why that is is a good question,

36:33.560 --> 36:38.240
 but that's the reason why RNA viruses

36:38.240 --> 36:39.400
 are far more successful.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.640
 They, in fact, many more hosts

36:41.640 --> 36:44.120
 and they're very, I would say slippery,

36:44.120 --> 36:46.440
 they can change hosts really quickly

36:46.440 --> 36:49.480
 because in any animal harboring an RNA virus,

36:50.400 --> 36:52.960
 like let's say a bat in some cave somewhere,

36:52.960 --> 36:55.160
 it's not just one genome,

36:55.160 --> 36:58.640
 it's millions of different genomes of all kinds,

36:58.640 --> 37:01.280
 all within the framework of say, coronavirus,

37:01.280 --> 37:02.600
 but they're all different.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.760
 And one genome in there might just be right

37:04.760 --> 37:08.200
 for infecting a person if it ever encountered that person.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.440
 I mean, that's the thing that...

37:09.440 --> 37:12.400
 Or there could be a large number, this is a tiny fraction,

37:12.400 --> 37:15.040
 but a large number of them,

37:15.040 --> 37:18.080
 and they're all operating at the threshold of error.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.000
 That's fascinating.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
 It's like little startups, little entrepreneurs,

37:23.000 --> 37:24.040
 like a startup world.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.200
 Yes, and many of them fail.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.040
 Yeah, many of them.

37:26.040 --> 37:29.240
 And then there's the DNA viruses that are like the IBM

37:29.240 --> 37:31.800
 and the Google, the big corporations

37:31.800 --> 37:34.200
 that become conservative with the bureaucracies

37:34.200 --> 37:35.040
 and all that kind of stuff.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.720
 So they have a lot of baggage.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.760
 Yeah, it's expensive for them to reproduce.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.520
 Yeah, and they don't move quickly.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.800
 Yes, the RNA viruses are the fast moving members.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.440
 So that's what a virus is.

37:45.440 --> 37:48.880
 We call them obviously intracellular parasites.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.800
 And then I told you there's DNA and RNA,

37:50.800 --> 37:52.960
 but then let's go further.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.680
 The nucleic acid's not naked

37:56.200 --> 37:59.840
 because naked nucleic acid in the world isn't good.

37:59.840 --> 38:03.480
 I mean, it existed in the precellular world,

38:03.480 --> 38:07.120
 but there probably weren't a lot of threats to it then.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.680
 Naked nucleic acid doesn't last long in the environment.

38:09.680 --> 38:10.760
 So they're covered.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.160
 The nucleic acid is covered.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.960
 It can be covered with a protein shell,

38:13.960 --> 38:15.800
 a pure protein shell,

38:15.800 --> 38:19.280
 or it can have a membrane around it,

38:19.280 --> 38:22.360
 which would be lipids from the host cell.

38:22.360 --> 38:26.160
 So lipids, so it's fatty membrane.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.000
 Fatty membrane.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.440
 So our cells are coated with fatty membranes, right?

38:30.440 --> 38:32.480
 Our cells, the outer plasma membrane, right?

38:32.480 --> 38:33.320
 That's the same.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.320
 The viruses can be too.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.760
 So they're kind of like cells,

38:35.760 --> 38:38.600
 but without the ability to do the mitochondria stuff.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.120
 Some are, they don't have nuclei,

38:41.120 --> 38:42.760
 they don't have mitochondria,

38:42.760 --> 38:45.960
 but they do have a nucleic acid, they have a membrane,

38:45.960 --> 38:48.600
 and then of course there are spikes in the membrane

38:48.600 --> 38:51.240
 that allow them to attach to cells.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.320
 And so that completes our two different kinds.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.760
 So they all have like attachment mechanisms,

38:55.760 --> 38:59.240
 like ways to like keys into the cells.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.320
 They all have to get into cells.

39:01.320 --> 39:05.200
 There are a couple of exceptions though.

39:05.200 --> 39:10.200
 There are viruses of fungi and plants.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.880
 So let's do the fungi.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.560
 Fungi would be like yeast.

39:14.600 --> 39:18.760
 The yeast cell wall is pretty hard to get through.

39:18.760 --> 39:22.080
 So viruses typically don't attach to a yeast

39:22.080 --> 39:25.680
 and get inside, rather they just live in the yeast forever.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.720
 And they multiply as mostly nucleic acids,

39:28.720 --> 39:31.360
 and as the yeast divide, they go into the daughter cells,

39:31.360 --> 39:32.560
 and that's how they exist.

39:32.560 --> 39:35.600
 Plant viruses, also the plant cell wall

39:35.600 --> 39:37.360
 would be very hard to get across

39:37.360 --> 39:40.400
 with by binding a protein.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.840
 So plant viruses get into plants

39:42.840 --> 39:47.280
 either by pests that inject them in.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.440
 They're sucking sap out

39:48.440 --> 39:49.920
 and they inject virus at the same time,

39:49.920 --> 39:52.600
 or farmers, they have contaminated farm equipment

39:52.600 --> 39:55.800
 and they roll over the plants and introduces viruses.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.680
 So those fungi and plant viruses,

39:57.680 --> 40:00.520
 they don't have this specific receptor binding

40:00.520 --> 40:01.480
 to get them into the cell,

40:01.480 --> 40:02.760
 but everything else, yeah,

40:02.760 --> 40:04.720
 the virus binds to something on the surface,

40:04.720 --> 40:07.040
 very specific, it's taken into the cell,

40:07.040 --> 40:09.000
 because that's what cells do.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.600
 When things bind their exterior, they take it in,

40:12.600 --> 40:14.280
 because in most cases, it's good,

40:14.280 --> 40:15.800
 it's something they need.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.200
 And so the virus slips in,

40:17.200 --> 40:19.200
 I guess you'd call that a Trojan horse, right?

40:19.200 --> 40:20.040
 Trojan horse.

40:20.040 --> 40:23.280
 It's so hard to not anthropomorphize this whole thing.

40:23.280 --> 40:24.160
 It is hard.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.960
 So obviously they don't know any of this.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.400
 It's not an actual Trojan horse.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.760
 So they're not getting actually tricked

40:32.760 --> 40:34.600
 in the way humans trick each other.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.720
 No, it's all passive.

40:35.720 --> 40:38.200
 And it's just through so many years of evolution,

40:38.200 --> 40:42.920
 it's you select something that works and it continues.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.920
 And what survives then goes on

40:44.920 --> 40:48.280
 with a perhaps a slightly different approach.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.760
 I love this idea of passive.

40:49.760 --> 40:52.040
 Of course, according to Sam Harris,

40:52.040 --> 40:54.840
 so for my sufficiently intelligent alien civilization,

40:54.840 --> 40:58.120
 observing humans, our behavior might seem passive too,

40:58.120 --> 41:00.800
 because they understand fully exactly what we're doing.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.200
 And then there's no free will

41:02.200 --> 41:04.080
 and we're all just operating in the same way.

41:04.080 --> 41:04.920
 It could be.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.800
 A cell does put just a much higher level of complexity.

41:07.800 --> 41:08.640
 Yeah.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.840
 So I love the distinction between active and passive.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.000
 I mean, the point is,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.960
 I think anthropomorphizing to a certain extent is fine,

41:15.960 --> 41:17.840
 because it helps people understand.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.600
 But when you start to say,

41:19.600 --> 41:21.120
 I think the virus is doing that

41:21.120 --> 41:24.720
 because then you're putting a human lens on it

41:24.720 --> 41:26.600
 and you may be wrong,

41:26.600 --> 41:29.960
 because you don't know why things happen for a virus.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.480
 So right now we have variants emerging.

41:33.480 --> 41:36.000
 And people say, well, I think it's because the antibodies

41:36.000 --> 41:38.200
 are selecting for variants.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.160
 That's a good idea,

41:39.160 --> 41:41.520
 but it may not be the only thing that's going.

41:41.520 --> 41:44.800
 You start imagining them coming to the table negotiating.

41:45.840 --> 41:47.960
 Yeah, you get into trouble with that.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.400
 That's why I tell my students,

41:49.400 --> 41:51.800
 be careful about the anthropomorphizing,

41:51.800 --> 41:55.960
 because you're gonna apply your values to a virus

41:55.960 --> 41:57.880
 and you have different value, you're a human.

41:57.880 --> 42:00.560
 And you have, what you think is the reason

42:00.560 --> 42:01.920
 for this outcome may not be right.

42:01.920 --> 42:02.760
 That's all.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.240
 Just be open minded about it.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.200
 In both directions.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.760
 I actually, one of the things that pushed back

42:07.760 --> 42:10.400
 on this in the space of robotics,

42:10.400 --> 42:12.320
 people, most people in robotics

42:12.320 --> 42:14.600
 try to not anthropomorphize.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.520
 For example, they don't give a gender or a name to robots.

42:17.520 --> 42:20.080
 They really try to see as a machine.

42:20.080 --> 42:23.880
 And to me, that makes sense in one way,

42:23.880 --> 42:25.520
 but it totally doesn't make sense in another.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.680
 If that robot is to interact,

42:27.680 --> 42:30.800
 operate in the human world and interact with humans,

42:30.800 --> 42:33.920
 we have to anthropomorphize it

42:33.920 --> 42:37.720
 in order to understand as an engineering problem,

42:38.920 --> 42:42.120
 how should it operate in a human world?

42:42.120 --> 42:43.960
 Now, the difference with viruses,

42:43.960 --> 42:46.080
 the scale of operation,

42:46.080 --> 42:49.320
 it doesn't make sense to treat them as human like,

42:49.320 --> 42:51.600
 because the scale of operation is much smaller,

42:51.600 --> 42:54.280
 but with robots, you're in the same time scale

42:54.280 --> 42:55.440
 at the same spatial scale.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.360
 Of course, in the movies,

42:56.360 --> 42:58.560
 they always give them names and personalities.

42:58.560 --> 43:01.680
 Yeah, well, yeah, that's my argument

43:01.680 --> 43:03.040
 is we should do the same

43:03.040 --> 43:05.280
 when you're trying to solve the engineering problem

43:05.280 --> 43:06.360
 of robotics too.

43:06.360 --> 43:07.840
 It's not just for the movies.

43:07.840 --> 43:08.880
 Well, let me ask you this,

43:08.880 --> 43:12.360
 because you've said, controversially, not really,

43:12.360 --> 43:14.760
 that viruses are not living.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.280
 Defend yourself.

43:19.280 --> 43:20.680
 Are viruses alive or not?

43:20.680 --> 43:22.080
 So I've seen many people say,

43:22.080 --> 43:25.000
 oh, they have to be, they have nucleic acids,

43:25.000 --> 43:27.160
 they evolve, they mutate.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.600
 That's all true, but they don't do it on their own.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.240
 The particles in my mug are just not doing any of that

43:32.240 --> 43:33.920
 unless they get into a cell.

43:33.920 --> 43:36.200
 So a virus infected cell is alive.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.800
 I totally agree with that,

43:37.800 --> 43:40.800
 because in fact, when a virus gets in a cell,

43:40.800 --> 43:45.280
 it converts it into a virus making factory, if you will.

43:45.280 --> 43:47.280
 There's no longer a cell.

43:47.280 --> 43:48.920
 Some people call it a virus cell.

43:48.920 --> 43:51.160
 I don't really like that, but it's fine.

43:51.160 --> 43:53.000
 So that's what I'm talking about.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.840
 The particle is not alive.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.760
 You can have your virus infected cell as alive,

43:57.760 --> 44:02.200
 but the particle, it just would not do anything forever

44:02.200 --> 44:03.840
 without getting inside of a cell.

44:03.840 --> 44:07.040
 Well, once it's into cells, it is alive then,

44:07.040 --> 44:08.200
 but it's no longer a particle.

44:08.200 --> 44:11.360
 It's taken apart and nucleic acid is moving around the cell.

44:11.360 --> 44:12.920
 It's making proteins.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.080
 Eventually it makes new particles.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.440
 And then those particles released from the cell,

44:16.440 --> 44:17.960
 they're not living anymore.

44:17.960 --> 44:22.960
 So I think it's kind of like a spore, a spore of a seed.

44:25.200 --> 44:26.800
 Although the seed just doesn't work

44:26.800 --> 44:29.120
 because the cells in the seed

44:29.120 --> 44:31.920
 have the ability to make their own energy and so forth.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.440
 But a bacterial spore, and it's the same thing,

44:34.440 --> 44:36.560
 doesn't do anything unless you add water and nutrients

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
 and that starts to divide,

44:37.560 --> 44:39.040
 but it doesn't need to get into a cell.

44:39.040 --> 44:40.640
 It's very different from a virus.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.440
 So that's why the particle.

44:42.440 --> 44:45.320
 And when people think of virus,

44:45.320 --> 44:47.360
 they're always thinking of the particle.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.280
 And that's why I say it can't be alive

44:49.280 --> 44:51.360
 because the particle can't do anything on its own.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.400
 But if you think of a virus as an organism

44:53.400 --> 44:55.880
 with a particle phase in a cell,

44:55.880 --> 44:58.360
 then it makes sense to be alive.

44:58.360 --> 44:59.880
 And by the way, when you say particle,

44:59.880 --> 45:01.200
 you're referring to that structure

45:01.200 --> 45:03.480
 that you've been mentioning some parts of membrane and not,

45:03.480 --> 45:06.640
 that has been called, what is it, a virion particle?

45:06.640 --> 45:10.320
 Virion, so what you should have here, I'll send you one.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.840
 And then you can refer to it.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.680
 What's the sexiest one to have?

45:13.680 --> 45:17.960
 Like what, in terms of particles to have on a table?

45:17.960 --> 45:21.440
 Well, fortunately, the ones that you can 3D print.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.120
 Oh, they're not going to be, super.

45:23.120 --> 45:26.400
 They're the ones that we know the structure's of, right?

45:26.400 --> 45:29.240
 So someone sent me last year,

45:29.240 --> 45:32.040
 a 3D model of SARS CoV2, and it's beautiful.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.760
 It's actually cracked open, so you can see the RNA

45:34.760 --> 45:37.000
 and the spikes are sticking out.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.800
 And they even put some antibodies sticking onto the spikes.

45:39.800 --> 45:42.800
 And I mean, when I show this on a live stream,

45:42.800 --> 45:45.000
 people love this, they go, oh my God, this is beautiful.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.680
 And it is, it's absolutely gorgeous.

45:46.680 --> 45:48.960
 I have that, I have my virus

45:48.960 --> 45:50.880
 that I worked on most of my career polio virus.

45:50.880 --> 45:54.240
 I have a 3D model of that, which I actually just had made.

45:54.240 --> 45:55.080
 It's gorgeous.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.640
 And you can have it made in any color you want, right?

45:57.640 --> 46:01.520
 What would you say is the most fascinating,

46:01.520 --> 46:05.160
 terrifying, surprising, beautiful virus to you?

46:05.160 --> 46:08.440
 So of all the viruses you looked at,

46:08.440 --> 46:10.960
 sometimes when you just sit late at night

46:10.960 --> 46:13.960
 with a glass of wine looking over the sunset,

46:13.960 --> 46:16.240
 which virus do you think about?

46:16.240 --> 46:21.240
 So fulfilling all of those adjectives is hard, right?

46:21.280 --> 46:24.920
 Fascinating, exciting, terrifying.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.120
 Well, the terrifying is an optional one, I think,

46:27.120 --> 46:30.200
 because maybe that puts a lot of pressure.

46:30.200 --> 46:34.240
 See, terrifying, to me, I'm not terrified

46:34.240 --> 46:37.560
 because I think we can handle most viruses,

46:37.560 --> 46:39.080
 as you see with this brand new one

46:39.080 --> 46:42.440
 that emerged a year ago, we can handle it.

46:42.440 --> 46:44.120
 From a virology perspective.

46:44.120 --> 46:45.600
 Yeah, I mean, the human perspective

46:45.600 --> 46:46.840
 is a different story, right?

46:46.840 --> 46:47.840
 That's always an issue.

46:47.840 --> 46:52.840
 But so I think there are a couple

46:52.840 --> 46:55.600
 of different categories of virus.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.360
 So we could do the terrifying.

46:57.360 --> 47:00.040
 And I think rabies is a terrifying virus

47:00.040 --> 47:02.320
 because unless you're vaccinated,

47:02.320 --> 47:04.680
 100% certainty you're gonna die.

47:05.880 --> 47:08.400
 So you get bitten by a rabid raccoon

47:08.400 --> 47:10.960
 or bat or dog, whatever.

47:10.960 --> 47:15.560
 And there's still 70,000 deaths a year of rabies

47:15.560 --> 47:16.760
 throughout the world because there are a lot

47:16.760 --> 47:19.040
 of feral dogs running around that are infected.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.720
 Unless you're vaccinated, you're gonna die.

47:21.720 --> 47:23.080
 There's nothing we can do.

47:23.080 --> 47:26.400
 But we do have a vaccine which we can actually give you

47:26.400 --> 47:27.760
 even after you've been bitten,

47:27.760 --> 47:31.120
 which is the only vaccine that works that way.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.840
 It's a therapeutic, right?

47:32.840 --> 47:34.800
 It will treat your illness.

47:34.800 --> 47:38.560
 Cause the disease takes so long to develop,

47:38.560 --> 47:41.200
 eventually you get all kinds of neurological issues

47:41.200 --> 47:43.920
 and paralysis and so forth.

47:43.920 --> 47:45.920
 But it takes time and you can be vaccinated

47:45.920 --> 47:47.400
 and it will prevent that in the meanwhile.

47:47.400 --> 47:50.280
 So people always say, what's the most lethal virus

47:50.280 --> 47:51.120
 is it Ebola?

47:51.120 --> 47:53.560
 I said, no, it's actually rabies.

47:53.560 --> 47:55.960
 Unless you're vaccinated, it will kill you.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.760
 Maybe it's good to linger.

47:57.760 --> 48:01.160
 Cause we'll talk about vaccines a few times today.

48:01.160 --> 48:06.160
 It's good to linger on cases where vaccines have clearly

48:09.040 --> 48:12.280
 undoubtedly helped human civilization.

48:12.280 --> 48:15.400
 And it seems like rabies is a good example.

48:15.400 --> 48:19.000
 Oh, rabies is great because everyone knows what happens

48:19.000 --> 48:21.360
 when somebody gets rabies, right?

48:21.360 --> 48:24.480
 You have fear of water, hydrophobia.

48:24.480 --> 48:29.480
 Your body becomes spastic and stiff and jerks around

48:31.320 --> 48:33.600
 and you lose consciousness.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.320
 You can't, you know, no more.

48:35.320 --> 48:36.640
 It's not a fun ride to death.

48:36.640 --> 48:37.480
 It's horrible.

48:37.480 --> 48:39.200
 It's a horrible way to die.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.880
 So I think most people know that.

48:40.880 --> 48:44.080
 It's been popularized enough in media, right?

48:44.080 --> 48:47.040
 So then nobody would probably object to getting,

48:47.040 --> 48:51.000
 oh, I was just bit by this raccoon and it ran off.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.040
 Okay, well, we should assume it's rabid.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.200
 We should immunize you.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.320
 And most people are okay with that.

48:56.320 --> 48:57.560
 Cause they know the consequences.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.880
 And it's also pretty rare, right?

48:59.880 --> 49:02.120
 It's not like something that you're trying to get

49:02.120 --> 49:06.920
 into the arms of, you know, 250, 300 million Americans.

49:06.920 --> 49:11.680
 That's hard, but the few thousand every year, it's easy.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.800
 So the transmissibility is difficult, right?

49:13.800 --> 49:16.640
 It has to, oh, it's not, it's not airborne.

49:16.640 --> 49:17.480
 It's not airborne.

49:17.480 --> 49:19.880
 It just, you have to be bitten.

49:19.880 --> 49:24.760
 Although some, some people claim you could walk into a cave

49:24.760 --> 49:27.080
 and the bats, you know, breathing out rabies,

49:27.080 --> 49:30.040
 virus could infect you, but I don't really think

49:30.040 --> 49:32.400
 that's well, that's well substantiated.

49:32.400 --> 49:33.240
 Yeah.

49:33.240 --> 49:34.080
 I think it's a bite.

49:34.080 --> 49:34.920
 How would you do a study on that?

49:34.920 --> 49:36.360
 Yeah, it's, it's very hard to do.

49:36.360 --> 49:38.440
 You'd have to collect the vapors in the cave

49:38.440 --> 49:40.760
 and show that they're infectious, which,

49:40.760 --> 49:43.200
 and by the way, someone emailed me the other day,

49:43.200 --> 49:44.280
 you'll like this.

49:44.280 --> 49:46.280
 They say, why can't we just immunize all the bats

49:46.280 --> 49:49.280
 in the world against these viruses?

49:49.280 --> 49:50.520
 And I said, well, how would you do that?

49:50.520 --> 49:52.360
 There are caves everywhere, right?

49:52.360 --> 49:53.200
 Yeah.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.960
 And he said, well, maybe you could just go

49:54.960 --> 49:56.560
 and aerosolize them.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.400
 Yeah.

49:57.400 --> 49:58.440
 It's pretty dangerous.

49:58.440 --> 50:00.760
 And then, and then all the bats should have vaccine

50:00.760 --> 50:02.360
 passports to make sure that they're.

50:02.360 --> 50:03.200
 Yeah.

50:03.200 --> 50:05.320
 And I said, you have to get their consent before you do it.

50:05.320 --> 50:10.320
 But you, we do immunize wildlife against rabies.

50:12.040 --> 50:15.000
 We have rabies vaccines for wild animals.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.360
 So there are a whole bunch of them that get rabies.

50:17.360 --> 50:19.760
 And we put it, we put it in bait

50:19.760 --> 50:21.560
 and drop it from helicopters in the woods.

50:21.560 --> 50:24.440
 And it drops down the incidence of rabies and people.

50:24.440 --> 50:25.280
 Wow.

50:25.280 --> 50:27.120
 You know, people hiking get bitten and so forth.

50:27.120 --> 50:29.000
 It drops the incidence, so we can do that.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.320
 I didn't know that.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.840
 I was wondering how much medical care we're doing

50:32.840 --> 50:36.520
 for animals in the wild because I've recently become

50:36.520 --> 50:39.080
 more and more aware that animals are living

50:39.080 --> 50:42.000
 in extreme poverty, right?

50:42.000 --> 50:45.360
 Like, you don't know, you think like natural, it's great.

50:45.360 --> 50:50.360
 You know, like when animals are living on a farm,

50:50.880 --> 50:53.760
 it's terrible, but then you also have to compare to like

50:53.760 --> 50:56.360
 what life is like in the, or like the zoo,

50:56.360 --> 50:58.800
 you have to compare what life is like in the wild.

50:58.800 --> 51:01.360
 Well, the life in the wild is very tough, I think.

51:01.360 --> 51:03.800
 I mean, most animals have to, the carnivores anyway,

51:03.800 --> 51:06.200
 they have to catch their food every day, right?

51:06.200 --> 51:08.240
 And then there's the viruses there.

51:08.240 --> 51:09.240
 They have viruses as well.

51:09.240 --> 51:14.240
 So the rabies immunization is the only one I'm aware of

51:14.240 --> 51:16.400
 for wild animals.

51:17.480 --> 51:20.920
 We do immunize lots of other animals.

51:20.920 --> 51:25.760
 We immunize chickens and pigs and cows, even fish,

51:25.760 --> 51:30.080
 farmed fish, we pick each fish up and give it an injection,

51:30.080 --> 51:32.520
 you know, when it's a small fish.

51:32.520 --> 51:36.240
 But that's mostly so that the farmers get a good yield.

51:36.240 --> 51:38.400
 We don't really care about the animals, right?

51:38.400 --> 51:41.040
 We want a good yield for market.

51:41.040 --> 51:46.040
 And then there's some examples where we immunize animals

51:46.080 --> 51:49.000
 to prevent spillovers into people.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.360
 So there's a disease called Hendra in Australia,

51:53.360 --> 51:57.560
 which was discovered in the 90s.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.720
 And it turns out there's, there are bats, fruit bats,

51:59.720 --> 52:01.040
 that have this virus.

52:01.040 --> 52:03.520
 The bats are fine, but sometimes they fly

52:03.520 --> 52:06.360
 into horse stalls and the horses get infected.

52:06.360 --> 52:09.040
 These are in Australia was initially race horses,

52:09.040 --> 52:11.240
 which are very expensive, right?

52:11.240 --> 52:12.880
 The horses got infected and they died.

52:12.880 --> 52:15.040
 And the humans who would take care of them would die also.

52:15.040 --> 52:19.280
 So now they immunize the horses to prevent,

52:19.280 --> 52:20.400
 well, to save the horses,

52:20.400 --> 52:21.600
 probably that's the motivation

52:21.600 --> 52:23.880
 because these horses are hundreds of thousands of dollars,

52:23.880 --> 52:24.720
 right?

52:24.720 --> 52:25.800
 And then the people don't get sick

52:25.800 --> 52:27.440
 because the horses don't get sick.

52:27.440 --> 52:29.360
 You don't want to immunize all the people

52:29.360 --> 52:30.360
 because it's too rare,

52:30.360 --> 52:33.960
 but that approach is called one world health approach,

52:33.960 --> 52:37.240
 which means everything's connected on the planet.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.360
 And we have to think of everything

52:38.360 --> 52:40.960
 in the grander scheme, not just us.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.920
 Yeah, so you can immunize some things

52:42.920 --> 52:45.040
 along the trajectory that a virus would take.

52:45.040 --> 52:45.880
 Exactly.

52:45.880 --> 52:48.240
 Some living beings.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.880
 In the Arabian Peninsula,

52:49.880 --> 52:52.640
 they have a MERS coronavirus issue every month.

52:52.640 --> 52:55.840
 There are a couple of cases where a camel

52:55.840 --> 52:59.200
 will infect a human and the human can get very sick.

52:59.200 --> 53:03.200
 It's a respiratory disease, very much like COVID.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.840
 And so camels are very common there.

53:05.840 --> 53:10.520
 They're raced, they're used as pets, they're eaten.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.560
 So there's a lot of human camel contact,

53:12.560 --> 53:15.120
 but the number of cases are rare to a month.

53:15.120 --> 53:16.760
 So you don't want to immunize all the humans.

53:16.760 --> 53:18.960
 So the idea would be to immunize the camels.

53:20.360 --> 53:21.200
 So.

53:21.200 --> 53:22.040
 I like it.

53:22.040 --> 53:23.720
 So, okay, so you put rabies,

53:23.720 --> 53:28.720
 but Ebola also is a famously deadly one.

53:30.040 --> 53:30.880
 What is it?

53:30.880 --> 53:33.280
 It kills like, I don't know, 50, 60% of it.

53:33.280 --> 53:37.120
 50 to 90, but that's in Africa,

53:37.120 --> 53:38.680
 where the healthcare isn't great.

53:38.680 --> 53:42.520
 What you saw when cases of Ebola came to the US,

53:42.520 --> 53:43.800
 we could take care of it.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.160
 We knew how to take care of it.

53:45.160 --> 53:46.840
 We had fancy hospitals and so forth,

53:46.840 --> 53:47.920
 and now we have a vaccine.

53:47.920 --> 53:52.280
 So we can, and the vaccine is really good,

53:52.280 --> 53:54.800
 but there are many governments in Africa

53:54.800 --> 53:56.960
 that are suspicious of us

53:56.960 --> 53:58.960
 and they don't want to use our vaccine, so they.

53:58.960 --> 54:00.640
 So there's a vaccine for Ebola.

54:00.640 --> 54:01.480
 There is, yeah.

54:01.480 --> 54:04.640
 And the effectiveness and safety of it,

54:04.640 --> 54:06.440
 to how much is understood.

54:06.440 --> 54:08.520
 So this is difficult

54:08.520 --> 54:11.920
 because there's not a lot of Ebola, right?

54:11.920 --> 54:14.080
 It's not a continuous ongoing thing.

54:14.080 --> 54:16.600
 There are sporadic outbreaks here and there.

54:16.600 --> 54:17.680
 Of a few thousand people.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.880
 At most, at most, usually a few hundred.

54:19.880 --> 54:23.040
 And the biggest ever, in fact,

54:23.040 --> 54:25.480
 this is why we didn't for years have an Ebola vaccine.

54:25.480 --> 54:27.920
 The US military, together with Canada,

54:27.920 --> 54:30.600
 developed an Ebola vaccine for service people, right?

54:30.600 --> 54:32.160
 They wanted to say, well, we're sending people

54:32.160 --> 54:33.440
 into these Ebola areas.

54:33.440 --> 54:34.720
 We want a vaccine for them.

54:34.720 --> 54:38.160
 So they had developed it through all the preclinical,

54:38.160 --> 54:41.000
 which means before it goes into people.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.280
 And that stopped because there was no money

54:43.280 --> 54:46.360
 to do a phase one and a phase two and a phase three.

54:46.360 --> 54:47.840
 In fact, for phase two and three,

54:47.840 --> 54:49.520
 you need to have infections going on

54:49.520 --> 54:50.800
 because you're looking at how well

54:50.800 --> 54:53.000
 the vaccine prevents infections, right?

54:53.000 --> 54:57.040
 So then there was a West African outbreak in 2015.

54:57.040 --> 54:58.720
 2013, 2015.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.760
 The most cases ever, 25,000.

55:00.760 --> 55:02.480
 So they got the test of vaccine.

55:03.680 --> 55:07.440
 But they only put it in a few thousand people.

55:07.440 --> 55:10.520
 It's not like it's been in hundreds of thousands of people

55:10.520 --> 55:12.120
 like the COVID vaccines has been.

55:12.120 --> 55:15.760
 So it looks like it has high efficacy,

55:16.640 --> 55:18.600
 but we'd like to have more data.

55:18.600 --> 55:21.480
 Side effects maybe are not so great.

55:21.480 --> 55:23.600
 There are a couple of different available vaccines.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.880
 Some have been tested more than others.

55:25.880 --> 55:29.800
 I would say this would probably not be widely accepted

55:29.800 --> 55:31.440
 in the U.S.

55:31.440 --> 55:36.440
 But then neither would be something over 50%

55:36.880 --> 55:38.520
 deadliness of a virus.

55:38.520 --> 55:41.280
 No, I think if you are, in fact, many physicians

55:41.280 --> 55:43.280
 work in countries that have Ebola,

55:43.280 --> 55:46.000
 so they get vaccinated because they understand the choice.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.520
 Yeah, right, it's always about the choice.

55:48.520 --> 55:49.440
 So.

55:49.440 --> 55:53.240
 So then one more thing to answer the interesting,

55:53.240 --> 55:55.440
 what are some of the viruses you really

55:55.440 --> 55:57.040
 are fascinated by?

55:57.040 --> 56:01.280
 There are a number of viruses that have clearly been shown

56:01.280 --> 56:04.640
 to alter host behavior, and that's how they spread.

56:04.640 --> 56:05.920
 I think those are fascinating.

56:05.920 --> 56:10.000
 For example, there's some viruses of plants

56:11.120 --> 56:13.440
 that are spread by aphids.

56:14.960 --> 56:16.800
 And the aphid bites the plant,

56:16.800 --> 56:18.920
 the virus reproduces in the plant,

56:18.920 --> 56:22.640
 and it somehow engineers the plant to give off

56:22.640 --> 56:26.480
 volatile organics to attract more aphids,

56:26.480 --> 56:28.080
 which will spread the virus.

56:30.120 --> 56:31.480
 Isn't that amazing?

56:31.480 --> 56:32.320
 Yeah.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.880
 So that's altering the behavior.

56:33.880 --> 56:35.120
 Might be a Twitter.

56:35.120 --> 56:38.680
 Altering because somehow the virus infecting the plant cells

56:38.680 --> 56:40.800
 gives off these organics and it attracts aphids.

56:40.800 --> 56:44.760
 And furthermore, somehow when the aphid bites,

56:44.760 --> 56:46.320
 it tastes horrible.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.440
 So they immediately leave with the virus

56:48.440 --> 56:50.080
 they've just picked up and go to another plant

56:50.080 --> 56:51.280
 to spread it.

56:51.280 --> 56:53.760
 So they're attracted and then repulsed at the same time.

56:53.760 --> 56:55.920
 And obviously you don't want to anthropomorphize this

56:55.920 --> 56:57.600
 like a strategy they're taking on.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.680
 Somehow this worked out.

56:58.680 --> 56:59.880
 It worked out this way.

56:59.880 --> 57:00.720
 It just evolved.

57:00.720 --> 57:04.320
 And evolution is sometimes hard to trace, right?

57:04.320 --> 57:06.320
 Like Darwin famously said,

57:06.320 --> 57:08.280
 he could never figure out how an eye evolved

57:08.280 --> 57:09.360
 from a single cell, right?

57:09.360 --> 57:11.200
 But it did.

57:11.200 --> 57:13.080
 The more complicated, complex,

57:13.080 --> 57:18.080
 the holistic organism is that the virus invades,

57:18.080 --> 57:21.360
 the less able it is to control that organism, right?

57:21.360 --> 57:23.400
 So I wonder if there's viruses that can control

57:23.400 --> 57:28.400
 human behavior to induce more spread of the virus.

57:32.880 --> 57:34.320
 Well, I don't see why not.

57:34.320 --> 57:37.080
 There's not enough humans I supposed to like evolve through.

57:37.080 --> 57:39.240
 Well, we can't do the experiment to test it, right?

57:39.240 --> 57:40.080
 We have to observe.

57:40.080 --> 57:41.720
 And that's always hard when you're observing

57:41.720 --> 57:45.040
 because there's so many things that can confound.

57:45.040 --> 57:45.880
 But you look at that.

57:45.880 --> 57:47.520
 Yeah, change human behavior, yeah.

57:47.520 --> 57:50.360
 I mean, there's so many things that impinge on our behavior,

57:50.360 --> 57:54.960
 but yeah, I think it's possible.

57:54.960 --> 57:56.520
 I think it's highly possible.

57:56.520 --> 57:58.000
 If it does it in a plant,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.760
 why not change some other organism's behavior?

58:00.760 --> 58:01.600
 I think it's fine.

58:01.600 --> 58:02.420
 Anyway, those fascinate me.

58:02.420 --> 58:06.080
 There are lots of examples of those that are fascinating

58:06.080 --> 58:08.840
 and how they work people are trying to figure out.

58:08.840 --> 58:10.680
 But there's not a lot of money to work on, you know,

58:10.680 --> 58:12.000
 insect and plant viruses

58:12.000 --> 58:13.560
 unless you're going to the USDA.

58:13.560 --> 58:17.120
 So they don't get a lot of work moving forward.

58:17.120 --> 58:17.960
 What is there,

58:17.960 --> 58:19.840
 if you understand some of those viruses,

58:19.840 --> 58:23.800
 is that transferable to human viruses, that understanding?

58:23.800 --> 58:25.600
 I think some of it could be, sure.

58:25.600 --> 58:28.240
 I think the general principles, for example,

58:28.240 --> 58:32.320
 how does the virus cause volatile organics to be made?

58:32.320 --> 58:35.000
 It must be turning on some genes

58:35.000 --> 58:37.440
 and you could learn principles from that,

58:37.440 --> 58:38.760
 how the virus might do that.

58:38.760 --> 58:41.320
 Sure, I think everything is broadly applicable.

58:41.320 --> 58:46.200
 So to say it's not useful to study viruses of insects

58:46.200 --> 58:48.080
 and plants is just wrong.

58:48.080 --> 58:50.480
 Because in science, we probably know this,

58:50.480 --> 58:52.920
 maybe in your field it's the same.

58:52.920 --> 58:53.800
 If you're curious,

58:53.800 --> 58:55.400
 you're going to run into interesting things

58:55.400 --> 58:57.200
 that you never planned on, right?

58:57.200 --> 58:59.720
 That's why people, like you can criticize,

58:59.720 --> 59:01.280
 why do we want to go on Mars?

59:01.280 --> 59:03.580
 Why do we want to colonize Mars?

59:03.580 --> 59:06.640
 Well, it's like, why do you want to go to the moon?

59:06.640 --> 59:10.640
 The reality is when you do really difficult things,

59:10.640 --> 59:11.640
 engineering things,

59:11.640 --> 59:14.360
 like all these inventions along the way are created.

59:14.360 --> 59:16.120
 It's kind of fascinating.

59:16.120 --> 59:20.040
 Basically just pick a thing

59:20.040 --> 59:22.600
 that everyone can agree is kind of cool

59:22.600 --> 59:24.480
 and it's really hard and do that.

59:24.480 --> 59:26.940
 And then you'll have like thousands of inventions

59:26.940 --> 59:28.200
 that have nothing to do with the thing.

59:28.200 --> 59:29.040
 That's right.

59:29.040 --> 59:32.080
 I think you should let curious scientists

59:32.080 --> 59:34.440
 just follow what they're interested in

59:34.440 --> 59:35.280
 to a certain extent.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.480
 You can't, in science, we say

59:37.480 --> 59:39.440
 we have translational research where we say,

59:39.440 --> 59:40.280
 okay, here's some money,

59:40.280 --> 59:43.600
 go cure cancer or diabetes or heart disease, whatever, right?

59:43.600 --> 59:44.560
 And that's fine.

59:44.560 --> 59:46.720
 But that often doesn't work out very well.

59:46.720 --> 59:49.840
 What works better is to say you have a good lab,

59:49.840 --> 59:50.840
 you have a good track record,

59:50.840 --> 59:53.000
 here's some money or something.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.880
 And that's where PCR, CRISPR, recombinant DNA,

59:56.880 --> 59:59.880
 all that stuff which has made the field explode,

59:59.880 --> 1:00:00.780
 that's all it came from.

1:00:00.780 --> 1:00:04.320
 Not from people saying I want to cure genetic diseases

1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:05.160
 by gene editing,

1:00:05.160 --> 1:00:07.720
 but by saying what are these repeated things

1:00:07.720 --> 1:00:09.840
 in this bacterium doing?

1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:11.160
 Yeah.

1:00:11.160 --> 1:00:14.680
 Can I ask you a big philosophical question?

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:17.240
 So there's these deadly viruses,

1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:19.000
 they're not very transmissible.

1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:21.560
 Ebola, rabies,

1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:23.840
 and then there's these less deadly viruses

1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:25.400
 that are very transmissible.

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:31.040
 Like COVID, I guess kind of borderline,

1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:35.600
 but why isn't there super transmissible,

1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:37.160
 super deadly viruses?

1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:40.400
 I think if you compare SARS one and two,

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:42.640
 you get somewhat of an answer, right?

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:45.600
 SARS one was more deadly.

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:50.440
 In fact, over half of the time when people were infected,

1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:51.840
 they ended up in the hospital,

1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:53.480
 because they were that sick.

1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:57.440
 And then the peak of virus shedding from them

1:00:57.440 --> 1:00:59.680
 happened long after they went in the hospital.

1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:02.800
 So it's easy to contain the infection

1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:04.680
 when you're in a hospital, right?

1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:08.720
 There was not much pre symptomatic or asymptomatic

1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:11.400
 shedding with SARS one.

1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:14.080
 And shedding means you become infectious.

1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:15.640
 So in a respiratory virus,

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:18.240
 you inhale the droplets of the virus

1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:20.880
 and they reproduce in your upper respiratory tract,

1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:22.960
 what we call the nasopharynx, right?

1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:24.920
 The nose and going back to that little cavity

1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:27.040
 just above your mouth.

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:28.480
 So the virus reproduces really well.

1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:30.160
 And then as you talk and sneeze and cough,

1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:32.600
 you expel droplets and then those are inhaled

1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:35.200
 by other people and then they reproduce.

1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:38.360
 And for SARS two, we now know there's

1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:41.520
 a lot of reproduction just before you feel anything,

1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:42.360
 if at all.

1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:45.600
 So there's a lot of shedding and transmission

1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:47.720
 before you get symptomatic.

1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:50.240
 And many people don't ever get symptomatic, right?

1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:52.880
 So they spread really easily.

1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:55.320
 So that explains why some viruses

1:01:55.320 --> 1:01:57.400
 can transmit a lot better than others.

1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:00.080
 And if one happens to knock you out,

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:01.400
 then you're never gonna transmit

1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:03.440
 because you're in the hospital like SARS one.

1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:05.880
 But why can't you have both?

1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:08.720
 Why can't you just wait a while before knock you out

1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:10.800
 but when you knock you out, it really kills you?

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.240
 That is a philosophical question, right?

1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:16.680
 Because we could talk about why we haven't observed it.

1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:21.680
 I mean, one issue is that if you're killed too quickly

1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:25.880
 by a highly lethal virus,

1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:28.000
 you're not gonna transmit it very well, right?

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:31.080
 So Ebola can kill you quite rapidly.

1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:33.240
 And most of the transmission occurs

1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:38.240
 when people are being cared for at home or in hospitals.

1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:41.960
 Doctors and nurses get virus, but people walking around.

1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:45.200
 You're not walking around when you have Ebola, you're too sick.

1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:47.400
 You know, you have black, bloody diarrhea,

1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:51.680
 you're vomiting, you're bleeding from your skin

1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:53.280
 and mucus membranes.

1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:55.480
 You're not walking around, you're not going to parties.

1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:57.960
 So I think that's part of it,

1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:00.420
 that if the infection is too lethal,

1:03:00.420 --> 1:03:02.560
 you're simply not a good transmitter.

1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:05.720
 And I think transmission is probably

1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:09.760
 one of the most powerful selection forces for viruses

1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:12.760
 because a virus always has to have find a new host.

1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:16.440
 If it doesn't, it's a startup that fails, right?

1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:18.560
 If it doesn't find a new host, it's gone.

1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:22.560
 And so anything that makes the virus transmit better

1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:23.640
 is gonna help it.

1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:27.520
 And if killing you, being less lethal is part of that,

1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:28.360
 that works too.

1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:32.360
 So there's a strong selection pressure against being lethal?

1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:34.920
 I think there's a strong selection pressure

1:03:34.920 --> 1:03:38.680
 against being lethal and being more transmissible.

1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:41.600
 Those two seem to work in opposite ways.

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:43.440
 And now we don't have a lot of data to support this.

1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:46.520
 This is kind of a thought experiment,

1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:51.520
 but there is one experiment done in Australia many years ago.

1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:54.720
 I don't know if you know this, but in the 1800s,

1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:57.400
 the hunters in Australia imported a rabbit from Europe

1:03:57.400 --> 1:03:58.440
 so they could hunt it.

1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:02.000
 Because the native rabbit in Australia was too fast for them.

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.440
 They couldn't shoot them.

1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:05.560
 So they brought in this European rabbit

1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:07.800
 and they reproduced out of control.

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:10.320
 Within a couple of years, they were everywhere.

1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:13.440
 Millions of rabbits and all the watering holes.

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:14.940
 And now they had a problem.

1:04:14.940 --> 1:04:16.520
 So they decided to use a virus

1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:19.100
 to get rid of these excess rabbits.

1:04:19.100 --> 1:04:22.880
 And they used a virus, a pox virus called myxoma virus,

1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:26.240
 which is a natural virus of a different kind of rabbit.

1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:28.640
 But for these European rabbits, it was quite lethal.

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:30.080
 And it's spread by mosquitoes.

1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:33.840
 So they said, okay, let's release this virus.

1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:38.840
 And in the first year, 99.2% of the rabbits were killed,

1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:45.160
 but that 0.8% that were left had some form of resistance.

1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:46.360
 They were variants.

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:49.080
 Every organism, not just viruses makes mutants

1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:51.000
 and there were some variants of the rabbits

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.800
 that could survive infection.

1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:56.600
 And then in subsequent years, the virus became less lethal

1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:59.160
 and then the mosquitoes had a better shot

1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:01.160
 of transmitting it from one rabbit to another

1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:02.360
 if the rabbit lived longer.

1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:04.240
 That's the selection probably.

1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:06.400
 And so in the end, the rabbits lived on,

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:09.200
 the virus was there, it evolved to be more transmissible

1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:11.480
 and less lethal.

1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:12.720
 So that's the only data.

1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:13.560
 Life is amazing.

1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:15.120
 Life on Earth is amazing.

1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:15.960
 It is, it is.

1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:19.480
 If you take the time to look at it and see what's happened,

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:20.760
 it is amazing.

1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:23.160
 It's also humbling that it just makes you realize humans

1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:25.320
 are just a small part of the picture.

1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:26.400
 Of course.

1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:28.360
 And we're wrecking it, aren't we?

1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:32.520
 Well, I mean, that's not really,

1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:34.800
 I mean, viruses are wrecking it some ways.

1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:36.880
 Part of this, we're not really wrecking anything.

1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:38.240
 It's all part of it.

1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:41.480
 But you know, when the ways that human exists

1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:43.960
 encourages viruses to infect us, right?

1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:45.840
 When we were hunter gatherers,

1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:48.720
 living in bands of a hundred people,

1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:51.520
 very few viruses because it was hard for the virus

1:05:51.520 --> 1:05:53.200
 to go from one band to another.

1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:55.880
 And perhaps a hunter would, one of these humans

1:05:55.880 --> 1:05:58.640
 would get an animal and bring a virus at the camp

1:05:58.640 --> 1:05:59.600
 and some people would die,

1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:02.200
 but it would never spread to another.

1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:04.560
 And then when we started to congregate in cities,

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:06.680
 we figured out agriculture and so forth

1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:07.800
 and how to harvest animals.

1:06:07.800 --> 1:06:09.520
 Then we could get bigger and bigger populations

1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:11.040
 and the viruses went crazy.

1:06:11.040 --> 1:06:12.600
 And they went from animals to us.

1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:15.160
 So measles went from cows to humans,

1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:17.520
 when humans learned to domesticate cows

1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:20.720
 and started gathering in big cities.

1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:24.920
 Yeah, but now that humans are able to communicate

1:06:24.920 --> 1:06:27.000
 and travel globally,

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:30.280
 the virus has become more and more dangerous, transmissible.

1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:34.000
 Thereby, if you look at earth as an organism,

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.800
 thereby pushing humans to be more innovative,

1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:39.640
 create Alpha Fold 2 and 3 and 4 and 5,

1:06:39.640 --> 1:06:41.840
 create better systems and eventually there's rockets

1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:43.960
 that keep flying from earth.

1:06:43.960 --> 1:06:47.480
 And eventually the virus is becoming super dangerous

1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:49.720
 and threatening all of human civilization,

1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:52.560
 will force it to become a multi planetary species

1:06:52.560 --> 1:06:54.560
 and this organism starts expanding.

1:06:54.560 --> 1:06:57.560
 So I think it's a feature, not a bug, I don't know.

1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:00.760
 Well, I think that we have our early,

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.160
 probably the most of the,

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:06.160
 we're studying viruses since 1900, right?

1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:09.720
 Most of that time was because of diseases they caused.

1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:12.960
 The first virus is discovered, yellow fever,

1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:17.960
 virus smallpox, polio virus, influenza virus.

1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:21.520
 Those were all because people got sick and they said,

1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:24.600
 oh, look, this is a virus that's associated with it.

1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:29.120
 And so we got good at learning how to take care of these

1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:31.720
 infections, making vaccines and so forth over the years.

1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:33.240
 And it's only in the last 20 years

1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:36.120
 that we recognize that there are more viruses out there

1:07:36.120 --> 1:07:38.240
 that are far more interesting, perhaps,

1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:41.120
 but we've learned how to deal with the bad ones for sure.

1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:43.480
 So we talked about what is a virus.

1:07:43.480 --> 1:07:45.560
 We talked about some of the most dangerous

1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:47.080
 and deadly viruses.

1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:51.320
 Can we zoom in and talk about COVID 19 virus?

1:07:51.320 --> 1:07:52.160
 Sure.

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:53.720
 I don't know what your preferred name is, but...

1:07:53.720 --> 1:07:56.480
 Well, the virus is SARS COVID 2,

1:07:56.480 --> 1:07:58.360
 which is hard, it's long, right?

1:07:58.360 --> 1:08:00.440
 And then COVID 19 is the disease.

1:08:00.440 --> 1:08:03.320
 So you could say the virus of COVID 19, that's fine.

1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:04.680
 The virus of COVID 19.

1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:06.240
 But for the purpose of this conversation,

1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:08.280
 we'll every once in a while just say COVID.

1:08:08.280 --> 1:08:10.480
 It's fine, no problem.

1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:12.720
 What is this virus from,

1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:16.640
 I don't know how many ways we can talk about it.

1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:21.640
 I think from a basic structural, like the variant structure,

1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.080
 biological structure perspective,

1:08:25.080 --> 1:08:28.080
 what is it, what are its variants?

1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:30.120
 Can you describe the basics,

1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:32.040
 the important characteristics of the virus?

1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:35.040
 So viruses are classified by humans

1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:38.280
 just to make it easier to keep track of them, right?

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.160
 So this is a coronavirus,

1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:45.160
 which is because when they were first discovered,

1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:48.280
 I think the first ones were animal coronaviruses.

1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:50.440
 They looked at them in the electron microscope

1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:51.960
 and it looked like the solar corona,

1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:53.480
 and that's all there is to it.

1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:56.320
 And I have to say that early in the outbreak,

1:08:56.320 --> 1:09:00.240
 the place with the highest seropositivity in the US

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:03.800
 for a while, 68% was a working class neighborhood

1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:05.520
 in New York City called Corona.

1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:08.120
 Can you beat that, right?

1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:09.600
 That's crazy, yeah.

1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:12.200
 So coronaviruses, they have membranes, right?

1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:13.160
 We talked about membranes,

1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:15.000
 they have spike proteins in the membrane,

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.360
 so they can attach to cells,

1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:19.040
 and inside they have RNA,

1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:22.000
 and they are the viruses with the longest RNA

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.120
 that we know of, none other comes close.

1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:29.640
 For some reason, they're able to maintain 30,000,

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:33.840
 so SARS CoV2 RNA is 30,000 bases of RNA,

1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:37.240
 and some of the other coronas are even longer, 40,000.

1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:41.720
 This is a, coronas are family viruses that included

1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:46.320
 the one you mentioned before, version one.

1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:47.800
 So SARS CoV1, yeah.

1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:49.560
 CoV1 and I guess other ones as well.

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:52.520
 So the first, we first learned of them in animals,

1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:56.840
 a lot of animals, pigs and cows and horses

1:09:56.840 --> 1:10:00.640
 have coronaviruses, and then in the 60s,

1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:03.960
 we discovered a couple of human coronaviruses

1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:06.240
 that just cause colds, very mild colds

1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:08.920
 that you wouldn't even think twice about, right?

1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:13.080
 And then suddenly in 2003,

1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:16.680
 there's this outbreak of severe respiratory disease

1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:21.560
 in China, and it started in November,

1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:24.000
 and they didn't tell the world until February,

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.840
 and that was really bad

1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:27.800
 because it was already spreading by the time

1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:30.080
 they told people about it,

1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:34.600
 but this went to 29 different countries,

1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:37.480
 only 8,000 people were infected, and then it stopped.

1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:40.600
 And that was the first time we saw

1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:44.840
 an epidemic coronavirus, and what they did afterwards

1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:47.000
 is they said, okay, it looks like it came

1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.080
 from the meat markets, they have live meat markets

1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:51.400
 in Guangzhou, in the south of China,

1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:54.000
 where you can go and pick out an animal,

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.600
 and the guy will slaughter it for you and give it to you,

1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:58.080
 and then of course there's blood everywhere,

1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:00.040
 and that's how they got infected,

1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:02.200
 and they figured out that there's this animal

1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:05.240
 called a palm civet, that was the source of virus.

1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:07.080
 The palm civets are shipped in from the country,

1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:09.640
 on the countryside, and the palm civets,

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:11.680
 somehow on the countryside, got it from a bat,

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:13.920
 so they went looking in caves in the countryside,

1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:16.840
 and they found in one cave all the viruses

1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:21.000
 that could make up SARS1, and that was 2000,

1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.160
 I would say, took about five, eight years

1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:26.960
 after that outbreak, so that was the first hint

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:30.880
 that bats have coronaviruses that can infect people

1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:32.920
 and cause problems, right?

1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:35.640
 And after that, we should have been ready.

1:11:35.640 --> 1:11:38.120
 So, didn't they already start developing vaccines

1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:38.960
 after then?

1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:41.320
 Yes, so some people started making vaccines,

1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:46.320
 they tested them in mice, but they never got into people,

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:50.880
 and some people started working on antiviral drugs,

1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:54.160
 nothing ever came of them, because, you know,

1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:57.480
 industry, there's no disease, it's gone,

1:11:57.480 --> 1:11:59.400
 why should we make vaccines in drugs,

1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:02.520
 and NIH in the US, you submit a grant,

1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:03.960
 and they say, ah, it's too risky,

1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:05.520
 there's none of this virus around,

1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:07.400
 so people were really short sighted,

1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:10.280
 because I always say, we could have had antivirals

1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:14.280
 for this, absolutely, for sure, no question.

1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:17.160
 In fact, the one antiviral that's in phase three,

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:21.000
 it's called molnupiravir, it's the only one

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:24.240
 that you can take orally, it's a pill, it looks really good,

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:26.320
 that was developed five years ago,

1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:29.320
 but never taken into humans, it could have been ready.

1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:32.840
 So we dropped the ball, and then the next decade,

1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:37.840
 2012, MERS coronavirus comes up in the Arabian Peninsula,

1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:41.600
 this comes from camels and infects people,

1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:44.880
 but probably the camels got it from bats originally

1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:48.360
 some time ago, but that never transmits

1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:50.600
 from person to person, very rarely.

1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:54.600
 Every new little outbreak is a new infection from a camel,

1:12:55.480 --> 1:12:59.320
 so that was 2012, and now here we are, 2019,

1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:02.720
 the new outbreak of respiratory disease in China,

1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:06.440
 and this one really goes all over the world,

1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:09.400
 where SARS one could not, and it's a coronavirus,

1:13:09.400 --> 1:13:11.120
 it's different enough from SARS one

1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:13.280
 that it has very different properties, cause a lot.

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:14.560
 But it still has a membrane,

1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:17.840
 it still has a very long RNA in the middle,

1:13:17.840 --> 1:13:20.480
 and then it still has the spike proteins.

1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:22.440
 What are the things that are,

1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:24.800
 what are the little, the unique things

1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:27.760
 that make it that much more effective?

1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:30.960
 That make it cause a pandemic of millions of people

1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:32.520
 as opposed to SARS one.

1:13:32.520 --> 1:13:37.520
 Well, the genome is 20% different from SARS one, say,

1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:40.320
 and in those bases, there's some,

1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:42.920
 there are things that make it different from SARS one.

1:13:42.920 --> 1:13:45.600
 It binds the same receptor, ACE two, on the cell surface,

1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:50.120
 so that's remarkable, it has a lot of the same proteins,

1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:52.280
 they look similar, like if you look at the structure

1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:54.680
 of the spikes, they look similar,

1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:57.040
 but there's enough amino acid differences

1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:00.080
 to make the bile, and what it is, we don't know,

1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:03.240
 because how do you figure that out?

1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:06.760
 You need to study animals, cause you can't infect people,

1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:10.280
 and the animal models aren't great, for example.

1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:11.640
 So the way you figure that out

1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:15.040
 is you figure out how those differences,

1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:18.600
 what functional, like how the difference in the amino acids

1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:20.880
 lead to functional difference in the virus.

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:21.720
 That's right.

1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:23.200
 Like how it attaches, how it breaks the cell wall.

1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:24.040
 Exactly.

1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:25.720
 And how the hell do you figure that out?

1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:30.000
 Like, I guess there's models of interaction.

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.160
 First you need an animal of some kind to infect, right?

1:14:33.160 --> 1:14:38.160
 You can use mice, people have used ferrets, guinea pigs,

1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:41.640
 nonhuman primates, all of the above,

1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:43.240
 and nonhuman primates are very expensive,

1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:44.600
 so not many people do that.

1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:48.440
 And then you can put the virus in the respiratory tract,

1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:51.560
 but in fact, none of them get sick like people do.

1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:55.560
 Many people with COVID get a mild disease,

1:14:55.560 --> 1:14:59.560
 but 20% get a very severe, longer lasting disease,

1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:00.800
 and they can die from it, right?

1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:03.040
 No animal does that yet.

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:05.480
 So we have no insight into what's controlling that.

1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:07.520
 But if you just want to look at the very first part

1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:10.920
 of infection and the shedding and the transmission,

1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:14.640
 you can do it in any one of several animal models.

1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:16.680
 Ferrets are really good for transmission.

1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:19.680
 They tend to have nasal structures like humans,

1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:22.800
 and you can put them in cages next to each other,

1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:24.920
 and they'll transmit the virus really nicely,

1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:26.680
 so you can study that.

1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:29.800
 But the other thing that's important that we should mention

1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:32.240
 is how do you manipulate these viruses?

1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:35.760
 So these are RNA viruses.

1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:38.800
 You can't manipulate RNA.

1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:40.840
 We don't know how to do it.

1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:45.840
 But DNA, because of the recombinant DNA revolution

1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:48.000
 that occurred in the 70s,

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:51.480
 we can change DNA any way we want.

1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:52.600
 We can change the single base.

1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:53.720
 We can cut out bases.

1:15:53.720 --> 1:15:57.000
 We can put other things in really easily.

1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.720
 And if I may give it a personal aspect,

1:16:01.720 --> 1:16:05.880
 when I went to MIT as a postdoc in 1979,

1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:09.040
 David Boothman said, here's what I want you to do.

1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:12.600
 The moratorium on recombinant DNA experiments

1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:14.760
 on viruses has just been lifted.

1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:18.200
 I want you to make a DNA copy of polio

1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:19.840
 and see if you put that in a cell,

1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:21.640
 whether it will start an infection.

1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:24.440
 It's okay.

1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:27.320
 So I made a DNA copy of polio virus.

1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:29.400
 It's only 7,500 bases.

1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:31.800
 It's much smaller than corona.

1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:35.600
 And I took that DNA and I put it in a piece of DNA

1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:38.000
 from a bacteria called a plasmid.

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:41.480
 And you can grow plasmids and many, many bacteria,

1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:44.640
 make lots of them and purify the DNA really easily.

1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:48.720
 And I took that DNA and I sequenced it

1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:50.920
 because we didn't know the genome sequence

1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:52.680
 of polio at the time.

1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:54.600
 And that took me a year, by the way,

1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:57.280
 because the techniques we had were really archaic

1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:59.960
 and nowadays you could do it in 15 minutes, right?

1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:01.480
 It's amazing.

1:17:01.480 --> 1:17:03.560
 And I took the DNA and put it into cells

1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:05.600
 and out came polio.

1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:07.960
 So that's the start.

1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:10.680
 Now, since then, everybody has taken that technique

1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:11.680
 and used it for their virus.

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:13.160
 You can now do it with SARS CoV2.

1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:15.960
 You make a DNA copy of any RNA virus.

1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:19.000
 You can modify it and you put it back into cells

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.400
 and you'll get your modified virus out.

1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:23.760
 So that's an important part of understanding

1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:26.600
 the properties of the virus, it's saying an animal.

1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:28.800
 By changing the virus, you're changing a DNA copy,

1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:32.480
 you're making the virus then and putting it into the animal.

1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:33.360
 Can you clarify?

1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:38.000
 So even in the RNA virus, you can take and turn it into DNA.

1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:38.840
 Yes.

1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:40.960
 And then that allows you to modify it.

1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:41.800
 Yes.

1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:44.240
 What's that mapping?

1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:45.960
 Well, no, no, what's the process

1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:48.280
 of going from RNA to DNA?

1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:49.640
 Reverse transcription.

1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:50.720
 That's reverse transcription.

1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:51.560
 Right.

1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:53.080
 Also, you actually go into the process

1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:54.680
 of reverse transcription to do this.

1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:55.520
 Yes.

1:17:55.520 --> 1:17:57.720
 Remember, David Baltimore and Howard,

1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:00.040
 have discovered this enzyme in the 70s.

1:18:00.040 --> 1:18:01.720
 They got the Nobel Prize for that.

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.520
 And when I went to David's lab at MIT,

1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:06.320
 he had the enzyme in the freezer.

1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:08.760
 He said, here, take this and make a DNA copy of polio.

1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:10.160
 Yeah, I didn't make the connection

1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:13.960
 that you can use that kind of thing for an RNA virus.

1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:14.800
 And so that's...

1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:15.880
 And then modify it.

1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:18.160
 See, any DNA virus already exists as DNA.

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:19.760
 So you can modify it.

1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:22.280
 But for RNA viruses, it was difficult.

1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:25.640
 And so then, from that point on, for influenza,

1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:28.000
 every other RNA virus and coronaviruses,

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.840
 people made DNA copies,

1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:32.920
 and that's what they use to modify and ask questions

1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:34.600
 about what things are doing, right?

1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:35.560
 What's this gene doing?

1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:36.400
 What if we take it out?

1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:37.240
 What happened?

1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:39.560
 Can you do the same thing with COVID?

1:18:39.560 --> 1:18:41.200
 Is it takes the RNA and then...

1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:42.040
 Of course.

1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:44.160
 And in fact, in January 2020,

1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:46.880
 as soon as the genome sequence was released

1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:49.040
 from China, the lab's all over,

1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:52.720
 we're synthesizing this 30,000 base DNA

1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:54.280
 and getting...

1:18:54.280 --> 1:18:58.240
 What can you figure out without infecting anything?

1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:01.680
 Just turning into, well, the reverse transcription,

1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:03.520
 turning it to DNA, modifying stuff,

1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:05.480
 and then putting it into a cell.

1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:08.280
 What can you figure out from that?

1:19:08.280 --> 1:19:11.600
 Oh, well, you could, let's say you can cut out a gene.

1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:13.240
 You see some genes in the sequence.

1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:14.680
 I don't know what these genes do.

1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:16.000
 Let's cut them out.

1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.800
 And then you could cut them out of the DNA.

1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:20.040
 You put the DNA in cells

1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:22.000
 and maybe you get virus out.

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.400
 And you go, oh, clearly that gene's not needed

1:19:25.400 --> 1:19:27.800
 for the virus to reproduce, at least in cells, right?

1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:29.160
 Or maybe you take the gene out

1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:30.880
 and you never get any virus.

1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:31.720
 So it's lethal.

1:19:31.720 --> 1:19:33.480
 Is there a nice systematic ways of doing this?

1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:35.440
 Do people kind of automate it?

1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:36.280
 Absolutely.

1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:37.480
 And we...

1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:41.040
 I mean, the problem with SARS, the COVID virus,

1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:44.440
 is it's 30,000 bases, there's a lot of stuff there.

1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:48.480
 And what makes it more difficult is that you have to,

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:53.480
 it's been classified as a BSL3 agent, biosafety level three.

1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:58.960
 And so not everyone has a lab that's capable of doing that.

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:02.760
 So it limits the number of people who can do experiments.

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:05.720
 You know, we're lucky to have a few in New York City,

1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:07.520
 but not every place has them.

1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:11.520
 So you cannot work with the virus just out on the bench

1:20:11.520 --> 1:20:13.040
 like we do with many other viruses.

1:20:13.040 --> 1:20:15.800
 You have to wear a suit and have to have special procedures

1:20:15.800 --> 1:20:16.920
 and containment and so forth.

1:20:16.920 --> 1:20:19.240
 So it makes it difficult to do basic experiments

1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:20.080
 on the virus.

1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:22.760
 But when it's a pandemic, there's a lot of money,

1:20:22.760 --> 1:20:25.560
 there's a lot of incentive to work on it harder.

1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:27.360
 And also you don't need to work on the virus.

1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:29.280
 You can take bits of it and work,

1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:31.200
 you could say just the spike, right?

1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:33.880
 And say, can we make a vaccine with just the spike?

1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:36.080
 Cause that doesn't require BSL3.

1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:36.920
 So yes.

1:20:36.920 --> 1:20:40.480
 So like building a vaccine requires you to figure out

1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:44.680
 how or antiviral drugs, how to attack various structural

1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:47.040
 parts of the virus and the functional parts of the virus.

1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:47.880
 Right.

1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:50.040
 You have to decide on a target.

1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:50.880
 Yeah.

1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:52.360
 Like I'm going to make an antiviral.

1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:55.480
 What am I going to target in the virus?

1:20:55.480 --> 1:21:00.480
 And there are a few things that make more sense than others.

1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:03.400
 Usually we like to target enzymes.

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:05.560
 I don't know if you remember any, your biochemistry,

1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:07.840
 but you know, enzymes are catalytic.

1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:10.480
 You don't need a lot of them to do a lot of things.

1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:12.920
 So they're typically in low concentrations

1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:14.400
 in a virus infected cell.

1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:17.160
 So it's easier to inhibit them with a drug.

1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:20.960
 And the coronas have a couple of enzymes that we can target.

1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:23.680
 So you have to figure that out ahead of time

1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:25.120
 and decide what to go after.

1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:27.080
 And then you can look for drugs that inhibit

1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:28.440
 what you're interested in.

1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:29.960
 It's not that hard to do.

1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:34.080
 Is there just something beautiful about biology,

1:21:34.080 --> 1:21:36.120
 about the mechanisms of biology?

1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:40.840
 And I kind of regret falling in love with computer science

1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:45.840
 so much that I left that biology textbook on the show

1:21:46.320 --> 1:21:47.400
 and left it behind,

1:21:47.400 --> 1:21:49.520
 but hopefully we'll return to it now

1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:51.920
 because I think one of the things you learn

1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:55.080
 even in computer science that studying biology

1:21:56.080 --> 1:22:01.080
 and certainly neurobiology, you get inspired.

1:22:02.840 --> 1:22:05.200
 Here's a mechanism of incredible complexity

1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:06.560
 that works really well.

1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:09.560
 It's very robust, it's very effective, efficient.

1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:11.840
 It inspires you to come up with techniques

1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:13.760
 that you can engineer in the machine.

1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:15.800
 That's what drives a field forward

1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:20.800
 when people improvise and come up with new technologies

1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:22.760
 that really make a difference.

1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:25.280
 And we have a bunch of those now.

1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:28.480
 What's the difference between the coronavirus family

1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:33.080
 and the other popular family, influenza virus family?

1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:37.320
 I mean, if I were, because you mentioned

1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:38.480
 we should have done a lot more

1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:39.920
 in terms of vaccine development,

1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:42.320
 that kind of thing for coronaviruses.

1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:46.480
 But if I were back then, from my understanding,

1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:49.880
 the thing we should all be afraid of is influenza,

1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:53.880
 like some strong variants coming out from that family,

1:22:53.880 --> 1:22:57.920
 that seems like the one that will destroy human civilization

1:22:57.920 --> 1:23:00.280
 or hurt us really badly.

1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:02.560
 I don't know if you agree with this sense,

1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:06.520
 but maybe you can also just clarify

1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:09.560
 what to use is the difference between the families.

1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:11.000
 So it's an interesting difference.

1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:14.440
 They both have membranes, right?

1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:17.960
 So then they have spike proteins embedded in them

1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:20.720
 for, and they're different spikes.

1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:24.240
 In fact, for influenza, there are two main ones.

1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:26.040
 They're called the HA and the NA.

1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:30.840
 But what's inside is RNA,

1:23:30.840 --> 1:23:33.600
 but it's very different RNA.

1:23:33.600 --> 1:23:35.680
 And here we have to explain that.

1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:40.640
 So viruses with RNA can have three different kinds of RNA.

1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:44.480
 They can have what we call plus RNA.

1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:48.200
 They can have minus RNA,

1:23:48.200 --> 1:23:49.840
 or they could have plus minus,

1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:54.560
 actually two strands hybridized together.

1:23:54.560 --> 1:23:57.520
 The plus RNA simply means

1:23:57.520 --> 1:24:01.840
 that if you put that plus RNA in a cell,

1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:03.680
 you know, your cell has ribosomes in it

1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:05.760
 that make the proteins that you need.

1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:08.600
 The ribosomes will immediately latch onto the plus RNA

1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:09.960
 and begin to make proteins.

1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:15.320
 A minus RNA is not the right strand to make proteins.

1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:17.200
 So it has to be copied first.

1:24:17.200 --> 1:24:19.600
 And then the plus minus is both together.

1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:22.560
 So the SARS coronaviruses,

1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:25.280
 all the coronaviruses have plus RNA.

1:24:25.280 --> 1:24:26.800
 So as soon as that RNA gets in the cell,

1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:28.400
 boom, it starts an infectious cycle.

1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:30.080
 Same thing with poliovirus, by the way,

1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:31.240
 which I worked on.

1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:34.880
 Influenza viruses are negative stranded.

1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:37.760
 So they cannot be translated when they get in the cell.

1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:40.000
 So that's tough for the virus

1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:45.000
 because the cell actually cannot make plus RNA

1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:46.960
 from minus RNA.

1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:49.120
 It doesn't have the enzyme to do it.

1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:53.560
 So the virus has to carry it in inside the virus particle.

1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:55.560
 And then when the minus RNA is in the cell,

1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:58.560
 the virus enzyme makes plus RNAs and those get translated.

1:24:59.400 --> 1:25:00.280
 It's a big difference.

1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:03.360
 And then in the influenza viruses,

1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:07.000
 not only is it minus RNA, but it's in pieces.

1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.440
 It's in eight pieces.

1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:10.840
 We call that segmented,

1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:14.840
 whereas the corona is in one long piece of RNA.

1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:15.680
 So what is that?

1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:17.840
 Is that they're like floating separately?

1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:19.560
 Yeah, so the genes are on separate pieces.

1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:21.800
 They're all packaged inside that virus particle

1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:23.720
 of influenza virus, but they're in pieces.

1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:25.440
 And why that's important

1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:29.280
 is because if two different influenza viruses

1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:31.440
 infect the same cell,

1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:33.720
 the pieces as they reproduce can mix

1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:38.160
 and out can come a virus with a new assortment of pieces.

1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:40.200
 And that allows influenza virus

1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:43.800
 to undergo extremely high frequency evolution.

1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:45.600
 That's why we get pandemics.

1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:47.000
 When we have a new flu pandemics

1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.920
 is because somewhere in some animal,

1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:53.080
 two viruses have reassorted and made a new virus

1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:55.280
 that we hadn't seen before.

1:25:55.280 --> 1:26:00.280
 So you're talking about kind of biological characteristics,

1:26:00.760 --> 1:26:03.640
 but what am I incorrect in my intuition

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.680
 that are from the things I've heard

1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:09.880
 that the influenza family of viruses is more dangerous?

1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:12.560
 Like what makes it more dangerous to humans?

1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:16.080
 Well, it depends on the,

1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:19.400
 there are many flavors or vintages of influenza virus.

1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:21.200
 Some are dangerous and some are not, right?

1:26:21.200 --> 1:26:22.560
 It depends on which one.

1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:26.360
 Some, like the 1918 apparently was very lethal,

1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:28.280
 killed a lot of people,

1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:30.080
 but more contemporary viruses.

1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:35.080
 We had a pandemic in 2009 of influenza.

1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:39.280
 That wasn't such a lethal virus.

1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:40.640
 We don't know exactly why,

1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:42.280
 but it didn't kill that many people.

1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:43.840
 It transmitted pretty well.

1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:45.200
 Is that the bird flu one?

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:47.560
 They're all deriving.

1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:49.720
 That one was called swine influenza.

1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:51.280
 Swine, that's right, swine, yeah.

1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:52.280
 Started in a pig,

1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:53.480
 but it had bird,

1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:57.040
 it had RNAs from bird influenza viruses.

1:26:57.040 --> 1:26:59.400
 These viruses are all reassortants

1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:03.040
 of different viruses from pigs and birds and humans.

1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:07.160
 But influenza can cause pneumonia

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.960
 and can kill you as does SARS COVID too.

1:27:09.960 --> 1:27:11.520
 So it depends on the virus.

1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:13.640
 So there is another influenza virus

1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:14.960
 that's currently circulating.

1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:18.600
 So right now we have the 2009 pandemic virus

1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:20.040
 that's still around.

1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:23.840
 And then the 1968 pandemic virus,

1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:25.760
 which was the one before 2009,

1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:27.400
 that one is still around too.

1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:29.080
 And that's more lethal.

1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:30.360
 And depending on the season,

1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:33.800
 some seasons the 2009 virus predominates,

1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:36.200
 some seasons the 1968,

1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:38.800
 and when the 68 is around you get more lethality.

1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:41.680
 So we're living with the influenza family.

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:43.960
 We haven't exterminated them.

1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:46.280
 Right, we never will, never exterminate them.

1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:47.120
 Why?

1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:49.520
 Because every shore bird in the world

1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:51.120
 is infected with them,

1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:54.280
 gulls and turns and ducks and all sorts of things.

1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:58.240
 But why can't we develop strong vaccines

1:27:58.240 --> 1:27:59.480
 that defend against?

1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:02.200
 Oh, we could do that, sure.

1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:04.920
 But that would not eliminate them from humans.

1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:06.800
 Even if you had the best vaccine,

1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:08.880
 you would never get rid of it in people

1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:12.120
 because there would always be someone who's not vaccinated

1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:14.480
 or in which the vaccine didn't work.

1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:16.240
 No vaccine is 100%.

1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:18.720
 Right, you just contradict yourself.

1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:21.080
 You said the perfect vaccine.

1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:21.920
 So...

1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:23.200
 Imperfect, imperfect.

1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:24.760
 But then you said,

1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:26.680
 even if you had the perfect,

1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:29.000
 yeah, some people wouldn't get vaccinated.

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:30.280
 But I understand what you mean.

1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:31.720
 So, but I actually was asking,

1:28:31.720 --> 1:28:35.240
 how difficult is it to make vaccines like that for,

1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:36.960
 it seems like it's very difficult to do that

1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:38.880
 for the influenza virus.

1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:43.000
 So it's really easy to make an old school vaccine.

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.520
 So the way the first influenza vaccines were made

1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:51.120
 was actually Jonas Salk worked on them in the 40s.

1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:53.320
 You just grow lots of virus

1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:55.960
 and you grow it in eggs, by the way, chicken eggs.

1:28:55.960 --> 1:28:57.920
 Nice, literally?

1:28:57.920 --> 1:28:59.840
 Wait, wait. Yeah, chicken embryo needed

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:02.800
 so they get fertilized and there's a 10 or 12 day embryo

1:29:02.800 --> 1:29:04.920
 in it and you put virus in it, it grows up

1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:05.760
 and then you harvest it.

1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:08.480
 You get about 10 mLs of fluid.

1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:09.640
 And then you take that,

1:29:09.640 --> 1:29:12.440
 you treat it with formaldehyde or formalin

1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:14.400
 and it inactivates the virus.

1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:16.600
 So it's no longer infectious.

1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:18.480
 And you just inject that into people.

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:19.840
 And that was the first flu vaccine

1:29:19.840 --> 1:29:22.200
 that was made for the U.S. Army, actually.

1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:24.240
 And then it got moved over to people.

1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:27.400
 We still use that old school tech today.

1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:30.680
 So you're taking, can you help me out here?

1:29:30.680 --> 1:29:34.480
 Okay, so this is a good time to talk about vaccines.

1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:37.000
 Okay, so you're talking about,

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.160
 you're taking the actual virus,

1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:41.680
 you put it in an egg, you let it grow up.

1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:44.080
 It's very funny that you put it in an egg.

1:29:44.080 --> 1:29:46.720
 It's very poetic.

1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:51.720
 And then how do you make it not effective or whatever?

1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:54.760
 Not infectious.

1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:56.600
 Not infectious, is that the right term here?

1:29:56.600 --> 1:29:57.440
 Yeah.

1:29:57.440 --> 1:29:58.920
 So how do you make it not infectious?

1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:02.000
 You can treat it with any number of chemicals

1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:05.360
 that'll disrupt the particle, so it no longer infects.

1:30:05.360 --> 1:30:09.040
 So that step of disrupting the particle,

1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:12.920
 is that very specific to a particular virion particle?

1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:14.880
 No, the same collection of chemicals

1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:16.320
 you can use for all kinds of,

1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:19.560
 and which have been used for SARS CoV2 vaccines also.

1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:20.560
 Same technology.

1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:23.680
 Okay, so what are, there's several things to ask.

1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:25.360
 So you call it old school in a way

1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:27.640
 that's slightly dismissive,

1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:30.040
 like people talk about Windows 98 or something.

1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:34.840
 So is there risks involved with it,

1:30:34.840 --> 1:30:37.440
 or is it just difficult to produce large amounts?

1:30:37.440 --> 1:30:40.160
 No, it's only, it's very easy.

1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:41.680
 I mean, you could do it in cells and culture,

1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:43.040
 but eggs were convenient.

1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:46.280
 And in the 1940s, we didn't have cells and culture.

1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:47.280
 We didn't have to do that,

1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:48.840
 so we had to use something else.

1:30:49.720 --> 1:30:54.720
 It's easy to do, but the process of inactivating

1:30:55.240 --> 1:30:57.520
 the virus with a chemical makes it

1:30:57.520 --> 1:30:59.960
 not the best vaccine you can make.

1:30:59.960 --> 1:31:02.480
 The flu vaccines that we have today,

1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:05.720
 which are mostly based on this inactivation,

1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:08.520
 is called inactivated virus vaccines.

1:31:08.520 --> 1:31:12.880
 Also, like the kind of thing it presents

1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:17.880
 to the immune system to train on is not close

1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:19.600
 to the actual virus.

1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:20.560
 Yes, that's what we think.

1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:22.400
 So that's why probably the flu vaccines

1:31:22.400 --> 1:31:24.920
 are just not very good, you know?

1:31:24.920 --> 1:31:29.040
 60% efficiency at the best, right?

1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:30.120
 Which is not really good.

1:31:30.120 --> 1:31:31.200
 What does it mean?

1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:33.960
 What is the measure of efficiency for a vaccine?

1:31:33.960 --> 1:31:37.520
 Well, it's how it does in the general population

1:31:37.520 --> 1:31:38.840
 at preventing influenza.

1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:41.920
 At preventing illness, not infection.

1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:44.840
 We usually don't measure infection

1:31:44.840 --> 1:31:46.080
 when we're testing a vaccine.

1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:47.680
 We just measure sickness.

1:31:47.680 --> 1:31:49.720
 That's really easy to score, right?

1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:52.000
 You do a trial and you say,

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:53.880
 if you feel sick, give us a call.

1:31:53.880 --> 1:31:55.280
 We'll tell you what this is.

1:31:55.280 --> 1:31:58.080
 So yeah, I mean, what's sickness?

1:31:58.080 --> 1:32:01.560
 Sickness is the presence of symptoms.

1:32:01.560 --> 1:32:04.960
 So this is good time to say what a symptom is, okay?

1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:08.880
 A symptom is what you only can feel.

1:32:08.880 --> 1:32:11.560
 Only you can feel an upset stomach

1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:13.360
 or a sore throat or that sort of.

1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:15.240
 It's the lived experience of a symptom.

1:32:15.240 --> 1:32:19.080
 Whereas a sign is something that someone could measure

1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:20.520
 and tell that you're infected.

1:32:20.520 --> 1:32:25.520
 Like virus in your nasopharynx or something else, right?

1:32:26.080 --> 1:32:27.080
 Signs and symptoms.

1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:30.080
 And so in a vaccine trial, they tell you,

1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:31.800
 if you have any of these symptoms,

1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:35.040
 they give you a paper with the exact symptoms listed

1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:36.840
 to make sure you're picking them up, right?

1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:41.480
 So for flu, it would probably be fever, sore throat, cough.

1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:44.120
 You call them and then they will do a PCR

1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:45.560
 and make sure you've got flu

1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:49.000
 and not some other virus that makes similar symptoms.

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:51.000
 And then they would say,

1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:53.760
 are you a vaccine or non vaccine arm

1:32:53.760 --> 1:32:55.760
 and to count up all the infections

1:32:55.760 --> 1:32:57.680
 and see how the vaccine did, basically.

1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:02.080
 That's so fascinating because the reporting,

1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:03.800
 so symptom is what you feel.

1:33:03.800 --> 1:33:04.640
 Yes, for sure.

1:33:04.640 --> 1:33:08.280
 And certainly the mind has the ability

1:33:08.280 --> 1:33:10.120
 to conjure up feelings.

1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:11.800
 Oh yes, absolutely.

1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:16.080
 And so like culturally, maybe there was a time

1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:20.440
 in our culture where it was looked down upon

1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:23.480
 to feel sick or something like that,

1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:25.120
 like toughen up kind of thing.

1:33:25.120 --> 1:33:28.560
 And so then you probably have very few symptoms

1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:30.120
 being reported. Absolutely.

1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:34.800
 And then now is like much more, I don't know,

1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:37.880
 perhaps you're much more likely to report symptoms.

1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:40.800
 Now it's fascinating because then it changes.

1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:42.080
 Oh, it is definitely a perception

1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:43.920
 because for your symptom,

1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:46.080
 maybe nothing to me or vice versa, right?

1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:47.480
 And so when you're doing this,

1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:51.080
 it's a little bit of a imprecise science

1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:54.120
 because and even it's a cultural thing

1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:57.840
 and some countries, something that would make us feel horrible,

1:33:57.840 --> 1:33:59.240
 they wouldn't even bother reporting.

1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:00.480
 No, I didn't have any symptoms.

1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:03.440
 So it's a little bit imprecise and it clouds the results.

1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:05.840
 So if you can measure things, it's always better.

1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:07.760
 But you start out with a symptom.

1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:11.120
 And if you say, if someone tells you this virus,

1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:15.760
 20% of the people are asymptomatic.

1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:18.200
 They don't report symptoms.

1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:22.000
 That number is probably not as a constant.

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.240
 It depends where you did the study.

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:26.920
 It could be different in China versus South America,

1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:28.440
 Europe, et cetera, yeah.

1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:29.640
 I mean, I was trying to fix,

1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:32.440
 so I took two shots of the Pfizer vaccine.

1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:34.640
 I had zero symptoms.

1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:35.480
 Wow.

1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:37.200
 So, and I was wondering, well, see,

1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:38.680
 but that's my feelings, right?

1:34:38.680 --> 1:34:41.120
 This is not, because I felt fine.

1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:42.080
 I was waiting.

1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:44.080
 Did you have pain at the injection site?

1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:48.640
 No, it was kind of pleasant.

1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:50.320
 You felt nothing the next day, no?

1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:53.400
 Nothing, no, no tiredness, no exhaustion, no.

1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:56.760
 But see, like I have an insane sleeping schedule.

1:34:56.760 --> 1:34:59.320
 I already put myself through crazy stuff.

1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:03.320
 That said, maybe I was expecting something really bad.

1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:06.800
 Like I was waiting and therefore didn't feel it.

1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:11.200
 But I also got allergy shots.

1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:14.640
 And those, I was out all the next day,

1:35:14.640 --> 1:35:16.440
 like exhausted for some reason.

1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:20.640
 So that gave me like a sense like, okay,

1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:22.680
 at least sometimes I can feel shitty.

1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:24.480
 That's good to know.

1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:25.320
 Sure, sure.

1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:27.200
 And then when the vaccine, it didn't,

1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:29.040
 but the question is like,

1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:32.560
 how much does my mind come into play there?

1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:34.920
 The expectations of symptoms,

1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:39.320
 the expectations of not feeling well,

1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:41.360
 how does that affect the sort of the self reporting

1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:42.200
 of the symptoms?

1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:44.560
 I think it's definitely a variable there,

1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:46.440
 but there's certainly many people

1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:48.440
 that don't feel anything after the vaccines.

1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:52.000
 And there's some that have a whole range of things

1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.560
 like soreness and fever, et cetera.

1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:55.400
 Yeah.

1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:56.240
 So okay, you were talking about

1:35:56.240 --> 1:35:58.560
 the old school development side, the egg.

1:35:58.560 --> 1:35:59.400
 Right.

1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:02.320
 What's better than that?

1:36:02.320 --> 1:36:04.400
 So then the next generation of vaccines,

1:36:04.400 --> 1:36:07.840
 which arose in the 50s were what we call

1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:11.440
 replication competent, where the virus you take

1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:13.920
 and it's actually reproducing in you.

1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:16.040
 Yeah, that sounds safe.

1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:18.720
 And it can be somewhat problematic.

1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:20.080
 Yes, as you might imagine,

1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:22.320
 cause you're not, once you put that virus in you,

1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:24.120
 you have no more control, right?

1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:25.720
 It's not like you have a kill switch in it,

1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:29.240
 which actually would be a great idea to put in.

1:36:29.240 --> 1:36:32.360
 Like nanobots, what can possibly go wrong?

1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:34.200
 You could just put something in there.

1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:37.880
 If you added a drug, you would shut it off, right?

1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:39.880
 And people are thinking about that

1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:43.560
 because now we're engineering viruses to treat cancers

1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:44.840
 and other diseases.

1:36:44.840 --> 1:36:46.960
 And we may want to put kill switches in them

1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:48.560
 just to make sure they don't run away.

1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:50.360
 Oh, which thing so you can like deploy a drug

1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.960
 that binds to this virus that would shut it off

1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:56.480
 in the body, something like that.

1:36:56.480 --> 1:36:57.440
 Something like that, yeah.

1:36:57.440 --> 1:36:58.600
 That would be the idea.

1:36:58.600 --> 1:36:59.840
 You'd have to engineer it in.

1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:03.560
 Anyway, these were, the first one was yellow fever vaccine

1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:06.240
 that was made because that was a big problem.

1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:10.840
 And this virus, and the way you do this back in the old day

1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:12.640
 was empirical.

1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:15.240
 So Max Tyler, who did the yellow fever vaccine,

1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:18.560
 he took the virus, which is a human virus, right?

1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:23.760
 And he infected, I think he used chick embryos.

1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:26.520
 And he went from one embryo to another

1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:27.360
 and just kept passing.

1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:29.320
 He did that hundreds of times.

1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:32.680
 And every 10 passages, he would take the virus

1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:36.560
 and put it in a mouse or a monkey, whatever his model was.

1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:38.040
 And then eventually he got a virus

1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:41.840
 that didn't cause any disease after 200 in some passages.

1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:43.800
 And then that was tested in people.

1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:45.440
 And it became the yellow fever vaccine

1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:46.760
 that we use today.

1:37:46.760 --> 1:37:50.400
 He selected for mutations that made the virus

1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:55.400
 not cause disease, but still make an immune response.

1:37:55.400 --> 1:37:57.600
 So those are called replication competent.

1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:59.440
 We now have the polio vaccine,

1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:03.120
 which was developed in the 50s after the yellow fever.

1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:05.400
 Then we had measles, mumps, rubella.

1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:09.120
 Those are all replication competent vaccines.

1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:12.400
 And you mentioned that's a good idea.

1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:15.440
 They are all safe vaccines.

1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:18.400
 The only one that has had an issue

1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:21.320
 is the polio replication competent vaccine.

1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:25.920
 It was called Saban vaccine or oral polio virus vaccine

1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:28.760
 because you take it orally.

1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:31.400
 It's wonderful because you don't have to inject it.

1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:33.240
 This is the perfect delivery.

1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:36.960
 Either intranasal for a respiratory virus

1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:37.960
 or orally for polio.

1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:40.880
 It goes into your intestines, it reproduces,

1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:43.920
 and it gives you wonderful protection against polio.

1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:48.120
 However, you do shed virus out.

1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:52.800
 And that virus is no longer a vaccine.

1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:55.600
 It's reverted genetically in your intestine.

1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:57.320
 So you can infect others with polio.

1:38:57.320 --> 1:38:58.600
 You could take that virus

1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:00.520
 and it put it into an animal and give it polio.

1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:04.360
 And in fact, the parents of some kids

1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:06.440
 in the 60s and 70s who were immunized,

1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:08.360
 we got polio from the vaccine.

1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:12.800
 The rate was about one and one and a half million cases

1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:13.760
 of polio.

1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:15.360
 So it's called vaccine associated polio.

1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:19.520
 And I always argue that we may not have

1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:21.200
 picked the right vaccine.

1:39:21.200 --> 1:39:25.440
 There was a big fight in the US and other countries

1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:27.560
 between the inactivated polio

1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:29.800
 and the infectious polio vaccines,

1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:31.560
 which ones we should be using

1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:33.960
 because we found out that the infectious vaccine

1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:35.280
 actually caused polio.

1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:38.040
 And eight to 10 kids a year in the US alone

1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:39.840
 got polio from the vaccine,

1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:43.520
 which looking back is really not acceptable in my view,

1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:46.080
 although the public health community said it was

1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:47.560
 to get rid of polio.

1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:51.400
 So now we're close to eradicating polio globally,

1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:55.960
 but this vaccine derived polio is a problem.

1:39:55.960 --> 1:39:59.200
 So now we have to go back to the inactivated vaccine,

1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:01.440
 which is tough because it's injected.

1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:06.440
 So the basic high level, how vaccines work principle

1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:11.200
 is you want to deploy something in the body

1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:13.880
 that's as close to the actual virus as possible,

1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:15.880
 but doesn't do nearly as much harm.

1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:17.840
 And there's like a million, not a million,

1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:19.640
 but there's a bunch of ways you could possibly do that.

1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:20.600
 So those are two ways.

1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:22.040
 And now of course we have modern ways

1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:25.040
 we can make mRNA vaccines, right?

1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:26.800
 What are the modern ways?

1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:29.160
 Do you want to look mRNA vaccine?

1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:31.120
 So that's the most modern,

1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:33.160
 but even before mRNA vaccines,

1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:38.160
 we learned that we could use viruses to deliver proteins

1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:41.680
 from a virus that you want to prevent.

1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:44.000
 And so the Ebola vaccine,

1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.600
 we took the spike gene of Ebola virus

1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:48.000
 and put it in a different virus

1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:49.600
 and we deliver that to people.

1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:52.040
 And that's called a vector vaccine.

1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:54.600
 And some of the COVID vaccines are vectors

1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:56.160
 of different kinds of most famous

1:40:56.160 --> 1:41:00.520
 or adenovirus vectors carrying the spike gene into the cell.

1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:03.360
 Can you explain how the vector vaccine works again?

1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:08.360
 So we have, we take a virus that will infect humans,

1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:11.520
 but will not make you sick.

1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:13.520
 In the case of adenovirus,

1:41:13.520 --> 1:41:16.040
 the years and years of people studying it

1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:18.760
 has told us what genes you could cut out

1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:21.000
 and allow the virus to infect the cell,

1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:22.160
 but not cause any disease.

1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:24.520
 So instead of doing selection on it,

1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:27.480
 you actually genetically modify it.

1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:29.000
 Yes, you modify the vector.

1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:30.640
 So you'll be much more precise about it.

1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:31.480
 You'll be very precise

1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:33.960
 and then you splice in the gene for the spike

1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:37.640
 and then you use that to deliver the gene

1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:39.680
 and it becomes, produce this protein

1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:40.960
 and then you make an immune response.

1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:43.200
 And vectors the term for this modified.

1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:44.200
 Right.

1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:47.880
 So we're now using viruses at our bidding.

1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:50.200
 We're using them as vectors, not just for vaccines.

1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:52.400
 We can cure monogenic diseases.

1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:53.440
 That is, if you have,

1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:55.560
 if you're born with a genetic disease,

1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:57.840
 you have a deletion or a mutation in a gene,

1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:02.000
 a single gene, we can give you the regular gene back

1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.000
 using a virus vector, cancers too.

1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.200
 We can cure cancers with vectors.

1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:08.680
 Wow.

1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:09.920
 Really?

1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:10.760
 Interesting.

1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:12.560
 I think in 10 to 15 years,

1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:14.800
 most cancers will be treatable with viruses.

1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:15.920
 Yeah.

1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:16.760
 Wow.

1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:19.680
 And not only can we put things in the vector

1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:21.080
 to kill the tumor,

1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:25.360
 we can target the vector to the tumor specifically

1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:26.840
 in a number of ways.

1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:28.200
 And that makes it less toxic, right?

1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:30.240
 It doesn't infect all your other cells.

1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:34.840
 But it takes time to develop a vector for particular thing

1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:37.560
 because it requires a deep understanding.

1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:38.400
 Yeah.

1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:40.880
 In fact, we have about a dozen different virus vectors

1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:42.920
 that have been studied for 20 years.

1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:46.320
 And those are the set of vaccine vectors that we're using.

1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:50.760
 So it includes adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus,

1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:52.440
 which is a cousin of rabies,

1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:54.240
 but doesn't make people sick.

1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:57.800
 Influenza virus is being used as a vector

1:42:57.800 --> 1:43:00.200
 and even measles virus.

1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:04.120
 So we're familiar with how to modify those to be vectors

1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:07.440
 and those are being used for COVID vaccines.

1:43:07.440 --> 1:43:09.800
 And then of course we have the new,

1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:12.600
 the new is just the nucleic acid vaccines.

1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:15.200
 So years ago, people said,

1:43:15.200 --> 1:43:17.720
 why can't we just inject DNA into people?

1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:22.360
 Take the spike and put it in a DNA and inject it.

1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:25.320
 So people tried many, many different vaccines.

1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:28.320
 And in fact, there are no human licensed vaccines

1:43:28.320 --> 1:43:29.520
 that are DNA vaccines.

1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:33.120
 Although there is a West Nile vaccine for horses,

1:43:33.120 --> 1:43:35.960
 that's a DNA based vaccine.

1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:38.200
 So if you have a horse, you can give it this vaccine,

1:43:38.200 --> 1:43:39.040
 but no human.

1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:43.200
 Can you clarify, does a DNA vaccine only work

1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:44.960
 for DNA viruses?

1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:46.880
 No, it can work for DNA or RNA.

1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:48.440
 Because remember, for an RNA virus,

1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:50.120
 we can make a DNA copy of it.

1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:50.960
 Right.

1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:53.800
 Well, still, when you put that DNA in a cell,

1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:55.440
 it goes into the nucleus.

1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:56.680
 Okay, right.

1:43:56.680 --> 1:43:58.080
 So it's, you're just skipping a step.

1:43:58.080 --> 1:43:59.160
 And eventually you get proteins.

1:43:59.160 --> 1:44:02.160
 For RNA vaccines, you're giving, okay, I got it.

1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:04.280
 So those didn't work for human vaccines.

1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:07.320
 And there were many HIV, AIDS vaccine trials

1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:10.840
 that used DNA vaccines, didn't work.

1:44:10.840 --> 1:44:13.360
 And then a number of years ago,

1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:16.440
 people started thinking, how about RNA?

1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:17.840
 RNA vaccines.

1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:20.280
 And I first heard this, I saw what?

1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:22.320
 I've worked with RNA my whole career.

1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:24.280
 It's so fragile.

1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:26.640
 If you look at it the wrong way, it breaks.

1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:29.760
 I mean, that's being facetious, right?

1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:31.600
 But you have to be very careful

1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:34.520
 because your hands are full of enzymes

1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:35.880
 that will degrade RNA.

1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:38.840
 So I thought, how could this possibly work

1:44:38.840 --> 1:44:40.120
 injecting it into someone's?

1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:43.920
 It's an example of, I was skeptical and I was wrong.

1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:47.000
 It turns out that if you modify the RNA properly

1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:51.120
 and protect it in a lipid capsule,

1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:53.000
 it actually works as a vaccine.

1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:54.960
 And people were working on this years

1:44:54.960 --> 1:44:57.120
 before COVID came around.

1:44:57.120 --> 1:45:00.360
 They were doing experimental mRNA vaccines.

1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:02.560
 And there were a couple of companies that were working on it.

1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:07.520
 And so at the beginning of 2020, they said, let's try it.

1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:09.720
 And I was skeptical, frankly,

1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:12.160
 because I just thought RNA would be too labile,

1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:13.680
 but I was wrong.

1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:17.600
 So this is, as we're saying offline, one of the great things

1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:20.600
 about you is you're able to say when you were wrong

1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:22.320
 about intuitions you've had in the past,

1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:25.160
 which is a beautiful thing for a scientist.

1:45:25.160 --> 1:45:28.120
 But I still think it's very surprising

1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:30.400
 that something like that works, right?

1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:31.400
 I am surprised.

1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:36.200
 So you're just launching RNA in a protective membrane.

1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:39.800
 And then now one thing is surprising

1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:45.720
 that the RNA sort of lasts long enough in its structure.

1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:50.400
 But then the other thing is why does it work

1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:56.680
 that that's a good training ground for the immune system?

1:45:56.680 --> 1:45:58.520
 Because is that obvious?

1:45:58.520 --> 1:46:01.240
 Well, I don't think it's obvious to most people.

1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:04.520
 And it's worth going into because it's really interesting.

1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:09.000
 I mean, first of all, they wrap the RNA in fats,

1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:10.560
 in lipid membranes, right?

1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:13.200
 And the particular formulation, they

1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:15.960
 test for years to make sure it's stable.

1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:17.960
 It lasts a long time after it's injected.

1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:22.320
 And the two companies that make the current COVID vaccines,

1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:25.760
 Moderna and Pfizer, they have different lipid formulations

1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:26.720
 to get to the same.

1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:29.000
 So that's a real part of it.

1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:30.200
 And it's not simple.

1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:31.840
 There are quite a few different lipids

1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:34.040
 that they put into this coating.

1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:37.040
 And they test to see how long they protect the RNA

1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:40.600
 after it's injected, say, into a mouse, how long does it last.

1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:44.480
 And the way it works is apparently

1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:48.800
 these lipid nanoparticles, they get injected into your muscle,

1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:52.120
 they bump into cells, and they get taken up.

1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:56.920
 So lipid fat is sticky.

1:46:56.920 --> 1:46:59.880
 It's greasy, we like to say.

1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:03.680
 And so your cells are covered with the greasy membrane also.

1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:06.560
 So when these lipid nanoparticles bump into them,

1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:08.360
 they stick, and they eventually get taken up.

1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:11.240
 And they figured this out right at the beginning.

1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:13.720
 If we put RNA in a lipid nanoparticle,

1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:15.200
 will it get taken up into a cell?

1:47:15.200 --> 1:47:16.320
 And the answer was yes.

1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:18.640
 It was just let's try it, and it worked.

1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:20.360
 So it's basically experiment.

1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:22.600
 It's not like some deep understanding of biology.

1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:24.120
 It's experimentally speaking.

1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:25.480
 It just seems to work.

1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:27.760
 Yeah, well, they had some idea that lipids

1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:30.440
 would target this to a cell membrane.

1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:33.840
 And remember, there's no receptor involved.

1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:36.840
 Like the virus has a specific protein

1:47:36.840 --> 1:47:39.200
 that attaches to a receptor.

1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:41.920
 It's not efficient enough to just bump around and get

1:47:41.920 --> 1:47:43.240
 into a cell.

1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:44.920
 That's what these things are doing.

1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:47.200
 And they probably optimize the lipids

1:47:47.200 --> 1:47:49.720
 to get more efficient uptake.

1:47:49.720 --> 1:47:52.800
 But it's not as efficient as a virus would be to get into a cell.

1:47:52.800 --> 1:47:57.560
 So you have no specific, which is why it's surprising

1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:06.080
 that you can crack into the safe with a hammer or with some fat.

1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:08.800
 I mean, that's kind of surprising.

1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:11.880
 It's kind of amazing that it works.

1:48:11.880 --> 1:48:17.320
 But so maybe let's try to talk about this.

1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:22.640
 So one of the hesitancies around vaccines

1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:24.680
 or basically around any new technology

1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:28.600
 is the fact that mRNA is a new idea.

1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:32.160
 And it's an idea that was shrouded in some skepticism,

1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:35.280
 as you said, by the scientific community.

1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:40.240
 Because it's a cool new technology,

1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:42.560
 surprising that it works.

1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:44.400
 What's your intuition?

1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:46.400
 I think one nice way to approach this

1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:53.040
 is try to play devil's advocate and say both sides.

1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:56.160
 One side is why your intuition says

1:48:56.160 --> 1:48:59.080
 that it's safe for humans.

1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:03.480
 And what arguments can you see if you could steal man

1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:06.680
 and argument why it's unsafe for humans?

1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:11.840
 Or not unsafe for humans, but the hesitancy

1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:15.160
 to take an mRNA vaccine is justified.

1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:19.520
 So many people are afraid because it's new technology

1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:22.280
 and they feel it hasn't been tested.

1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:25.960
 I mean, in theory, what could go wrong?

1:49:25.960 --> 1:49:32.360
 The nice thing about mRNA is that it doesn't last forever,

1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:35.040
 as opposed to DNA, which doesn't last forever,

1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:38.240
 but it can last a lot longer.

1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:41.720
 And it could even go into your DNA, right?

1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:45.800
 So mRNA has a shorter lifetime, maybe days

1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:48.760
 after it's injected into your arm, then it's gone.

1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:53.040
 So that's a good thing because it's not going to be around forever.

1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:56.640
 So that would say, OK, so it's sticking around

1:49:56.640 --> 1:49:58.320
 for your lifetime is not happening.

1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:00.040
 But what else could happen?

1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:01.920
 Well, let's see.

1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:05.280
 The protein that's made, could that be an issue?

1:50:05.280 --> 1:50:09.000
 And again, proteins don't last forever.

1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:12.520
 They have a finite longevity in the body.

1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:17.480
 And this one also lasts perhaps at the best a few weeks.

1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:21.040
 Now, this is a protein that's made after the RNA

1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:22.080
 gets into the cell.

1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:25.040
 Yeah, so the lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell

1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:27.840
 and the mRNA is translated and you get protein made.

1:50:27.840 --> 1:50:30.240
 And there's also a question, and I'm sorry to interrupt.

1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:35.080
 Where in the body, so because it's not well targeted,

1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:38.280
 or I don't know if it's supposed to be targeted,

1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:40.720
 but it can go throughout the body, that's one of the concerns.

1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:43.640
 So it's injected deep into your deltoid muscle,

1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:46.120
 right here, shoulder.

1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:49.760
 And the idea is not to put it in a blood vessel,

1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:52.400
 otherwise it would then for sure circulate everywhere.

1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:55.160
 So they go deep in a blood vessel,

1:50:55.160 --> 1:50:57.160
 and it's locally injected.

1:50:57.160 --> 1:51:00.360
 And they did, before this even went into people,

1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:02.960
 they did experiments in mice where they gave them

1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:05.000
 1,000 times higher concentrations

1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:06.800
 than they would ever give to people.

1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:09.320
 And then when you do that, it can go everywhere, basically.

1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:14.000
 You can find these nanoparticles in every tissue of the mouse.

1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:17.120
 But that's at a 1,000 fold higher concentration, right?

1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:21.120
 So I think at the levels that we're using in people,

1:51:21.120 --> 1:51:22.440
 most of it's staying in the muscle,

1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:26.000
 but sure, small amounts go elsewhere.

1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:30.400
 Could there be a lot of harm caused if it goes elsewhere?

1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:33.080
 Like let's say ridiculously high quantities.

1:51:33.080 --> 1:51:35.440
 I'm trying to understand what is the damage

1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:39.360
 that could be done from an RNA just floating about.

1:51:39.360 --> 1:51:41.200
 So the RNA itself is not going to be a problem,

1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:43.880
 it's the protein that is encoded in it, right?

1:51:43.880 --> 1:51:48.760
 This is a viral RNA which has no sequence in us.

1:51:48.760 --> 1:51:50.520
 So there's nothing that it could do.

1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:54.000
 It's the protein that I would say you could ask,

1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.120
 what is that going to do?

1:51:56.120 --> 1:52:00.560
 And the one property we know about the spike

1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:06.720
 is that it can cause fusion of cells, right?

1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:09.240
 That's how the virus gets in in the beginning.

1:52:09.240 --> 1:52:14.240
 The spike attaches to the cell by this H2 receptor

1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:19.200
 and it causes the virus and the cell to fuse.

1:52:19.200 --> 1:52:21.040
 And that's how the RNA gets out of the particle.

1:52:21.040 --> 1:52:24.080
 But so wait, I'm a bit confused.

1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:28.600
 So with this mRNA vaccine with the lipids and the RNA,

1:52:28.600 --> 1:52:30.680
 there's no spike, right?

1:52:30.680 --> 1:52:33.120
 The mRNA codes for the spike.

1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:35.880
 Oh, the mRNA codes, so it creates the spike.

1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:36.720
 Creates a spike.

1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:39.280
 So that spike could cause fusion of cells?

1:52:39.280 --> 1:52:43.040
 Yes, except they modified the spike so it wouldn't.

1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:45.080
 Got it.

1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:46.440
 They made two amino acid changes in the spike

1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:47.280
 so it would not fuse.

1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:48.520
 So they understand enough

1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:51.040
 which amino acids are responsible for the fusion.

1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:51.880
 That's right.

1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:52.720
 Interesting.

1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:53.560
 This is so cool.

1:52:53.560 --> 1:52:54.400
 So they could modify it.

1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:55.600
 So now it's not going to cause fusion,

1:52:55.600 --> 1:52:57.200
 so that's not an issue.

1:52:57.200 --> 1:52:59.680
 It's called the prefusion stabilized spike.

1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:03.080
 So the spike, when it binds ACE2,

1:53:03.080 --> 1:53:07.760
 that top fulls off and the part of the spike

1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:09.320
 that causes fusion is now exposed.

1:53:09.320 --> 1:53:12.040
 And that doesn't happen in this mRNA vaccine.

1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:14.920
 So those are the things that could have happened,

1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:18.400
 but I think they're ruled out by what we've just said.

1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:22.360
 But there's no better test than putting it into people, right?

1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:25.120
 And doing phase one, phase two, and phase three

1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:27.640
 in increasing numbers of people and asking,

1:53:27.640 --> 1:53:28.880
 what do we see?

1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:30.880
 Do we have any concerns?

1:53:30.880 --> 1:53:35.280
 And so now it's been in many millions of people

1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:40.280
 and we don't see most of the effects you see in a vaccine.

1:53:40.840 --> 1:53:43.200
 You see in the first couple of months,

1:53:43.200 --> 1:53:46.120
 things like the myocarditis with some of the vaccines,

1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:49.360
 the clotting issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine,

1:53:49.360 --> 1:53:53.520
 Guillain Barre, you see those relatively quickly.

1:53:54.920 --> 1:53:58.320
 And we've seen small numbers of those occur,

1:53:58.320 --> 1:54:01.480
 but other things we haven't seen

1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:04.840
 and you never say never, right?

1:54:04.840 --> 1:54:07.800
 Right, so I mean, this is fascinating, right?

1:54:07.800 --> 1:54:12.800
 It's like I drink, I put Splenda in my coffee

1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:19.760
 and has supposedly no calories, but it tastes really good.

1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:26.160
 And despite what like rumors and blogs and so on,

1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:28.920
 I have not seen good medical evidence

1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:33.920
 that is harmful to you, but it's like, it tastes too good.

1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:37.760
 So I'm thinking like there's gotta be longterm consequences,

1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:40.000
 but it's very difficult to understand

1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.060
 what the longterm consequences are.

1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:47.640
 And there's this kind of like distant fear

1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:49.520
 or anxiety about it.

1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:53.000
 Like this thing tastes too good, it's too good to be true.

1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.680
 There's gotta be, there's no free launch in this world.

1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:57.800
 This is the kind of feeling that people have

1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:00.320
 about the longterm effects of the vaccine.

1:55:01.640 --> 1:55:04.400
 That you mentioned that there's some intuition

1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:08.960
 about near term effects that you want to remove

1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:11.480
 like the diffusion of cells and all those kinds of things,

1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:14.280
 but they think, okay, this travels to other cells

1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:17.320
 in the body, this travels to neurons

1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:18.640
 or that kind of stuff.

1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:20.680
 And then what kind of effect does that have longterm

1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:22.720
 that's yet to be discovered?

1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:26.400
 What do you make for this vaccine, but in general in science

1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:31.400
 about making statements about longterm negative effects?

1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:34.400
 Is that something that weighs heavy on you?

1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:36.320
 Is that something that can kind of escape

1:55:36.320 --> 1:55:38.920
 through just large scale experimentation

1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:41.200
 with animals and humans?

1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:44.120
 Well, if you're really, if you're concerned about longterm

1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:46.640
 then you have to do a longterm experiment, right?

1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:50.480
 And maybe you don't see something for 50, 60 years.

1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:54.440
 So if someone says to you there are no longterm effects

1:55:54.440 --> 1:55:57.320
 of the COVID vaccines, they can't say that

1:55:57.320 --> 1:56:00.160
 because they haven't done the long experiment, right?

1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:02.720
 It's always the possibility, but you have to weigh it.

1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:06.000
 It's always, there's no free lunch, right?

1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:10.200
 It's always a risk benefit calculation you have to make.

1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:13.960
 You can have the study, it goes 50 years and then decide.

1:56:13.960 --> 1:56:17.880
 But I guess what you're doing is just like we said,

1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:22.200
 I forget with which one, with polio, with rabies, I forget,

1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:27.200
 but you're weighing the side effects of the vaccine

1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:31.080
 versus the effects of the virus.

1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:34.560
 And like both of them, you don't know longterm effects,

1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:38.640
 but you're building up intuition as you study,

1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:41.160
 which what are the longterm effects?

1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:46.160
 Like there's a huge number of people like that have,

1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:51.480
 like I don't want to say experts

1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:52.440
 because I don't like the word,

1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:54.480
 but people have studied it long enough

1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:56.320
 to where they build up intuition.

1:56:56.320 --> 1:56:57.800
 They don't know for sure.

1:56:57.800 --> 1:57:00.600
 There's basic science being done, there's basic studies.

1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:05.600
 We start to build up an intuition of what might be a problem

1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:10.000
 down the line and what is not, biologically speaking.

1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:14.280
 And so given that map, considering the virus,

1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:16.800
 there seems to be a lot of evidence for COVID

1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:21.800
 having negative effects on all aspects of the body

1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:24.840
 and not just even respiratory, which is kind of interesting.

1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:27.040
 So the cognitive stuff, that's terrifying.

1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:28.920
 All kinds of systems of, yes.

1:57:28.920 --> 1:57:31.440
 And then you look at the same thing with the vaccine

1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:34.680
 and there seems to be less of that.

1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:36.320
 But of course you don't know

1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:39.280
 if it's some kind of dormant thing that's just going to.

1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:40.400
 You won't know.

1:57:40.400 --> 1:57:42.600
 You have to make a judgment

1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:44.920
 and for a lot of people they can't, right?

1:57:44.920 --> 1:57:47.600
 Because they don't have the tools to make the judgment.

1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:49.360
 I totally understand that.

1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:54.360
 And we have let people down a few times in medicine, right?

1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:59.120
 And I know two very specific examples.

1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:01.920
 The first polio vaccine ever made,

1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:04.720
 the Salk vaccine was released in 1955.

1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:08.720
 Immediately, within months, a few hundred cases of paralysis

1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:13.720
 in kids who got it, because it was not properly inactivated.

1:58:14.600 --> 1:58:16.880
 Now you have to understand, parents were dying

1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:19.600
 for a polio vaccine, because kids were getting paralyzed

1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:22.920
 every summer, 30,000 kids a year.

1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:25.280
 And so they went and took it.

1:58:25.280 --> 1:58:27.520
 They took the word of the medical establishment

1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:29.920
 that it was safe and it wasn't.

1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:32.440
 Big let down, never going to forget something.

1:58:32.440 --> 1:58:33.840
 Although I think a lot of people

1:58:33.840 --> 1:58:37.240
 today aren't aware of that.

1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:39.400
 I think that was a big problem that's everlasting.

1:58:39.400 --> 1:58:43.360
 Then the attenuated vaccine that we talked about,

1:58:43.360 --> 1:58:48.360
 the infectious causing polio, yet parents continued

1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:51.080
 to bring their kids to be vaccinated

1:58:51.080 --> 1:58:53.200
 because they were said, this is the right thing to do.

1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:55.920
 And I have to say, I was involved in several lawsuits

1:58:55.920 --> 1:58:59.360
 where parents of a kid who got paralyzed

1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:02.760
 from the polio vaccine decided to sue the manufacturer

1:59:02.760 --> 1:59:07.760
 and get some money for their kid, and so they got mad.

1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:13.000
 And I think you could not, the first issue

1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:17.640
 could have been prevented, could have been prevented

1:59:17.640 --> 1:59:19.480
 by inactivating it properly.

1:59:19.480 --> 1:59:22.160
 I think the company just did the wrong thing.

1:59:22.160 --> 1:59:24.240
 The second we had evidence for,

1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:26.920
 and we should probably have not used that vaccine any longer,

1:59:26.920 --> 1:59:29.160
 but I think that destroys public confidence.

1:59:29.160 --> 1:59:31.640
 But those are, that's a minority of cases.

1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:33.440
 This is a minority, this is a very rare event, yeah.

1:59:33.440 --> 1:59:35.600
 But nevertheless, science as an institution

1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:40.080
 didn't make corrections in that case.

1:59:40.080 --> 1:59:41.280
 No, they didn't.

1:59:41.280 --> 1:59:45.520
 So what do you make of that?

1:59:45.520 --> 1:59:48.120
 I mean, it's very unfortunate that those few things

1:59:48.120 --> 1:59:49.500
 can destroy trust.

1:59:50.440 --> 1:59:51.920
 But I don't think that lasts till today.

1:59:51.920 --> 1:59:54.560
 I think today is a different era, right?

1:59:54.560 --> 1:59:56.280
 And most people don't know about those stories.

1:59:56.280 --> 1:59:59.800
 I already tell them to you because that's what could happen.

1:59:59.800 --> 2:00:02.280
 I think it could happen today.

2:00:02.280 --> 2:00:06.360
 If you look at the history of the polio vaccine,

2:00:07.560 --> 2:00:11.640
 the US Public Health Service wanted kids to be vaccinated.

2:00:11.640 --> 2:00:14.320
 So they did things that probably weren't correct

2:00:14.320 --> 2:00:16.600
 to get the vaccine back online, right?

2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:19.040
 But they did it and they pushed it through.

2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:23.720
 So the question is, what do we do today?

2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:27.360
 So I can look at, as we just said,

2:00:27.360 --> 2:00:29.160
 I can look at what might happen

2:00:29.160 --> 2:00:33.360
 and I can make reasonable decisions

2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:35.120
 about the likelihood of them happening.

2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:39.000
 And I can also say, I don't want to get COVID of any kind

2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:41.760
 because I've seen how nasty it can be.

2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:44.040
 And I decide I'm taking the risk,

2:00:44.040 --> 2:00:46.080
 whatever small of a long term effect,

2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:47.040
 I'm going to take the risk.

2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:50.000
 My family took the risk and many other people did.

2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:50.920
 Of a vaccine.

2:00:50.920 --> 2:00:53.960
 Of getting vaccinated because I think it's very small.

2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:56.920
 But I understand where people can't make that decision.

2:00:56.920 --> 2:01:00.000
 And that begs the question, what would they need

2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:01.280
 to make a decision?

2:01:01.280 --> 2:01:05.440
 So if you're concerned about an effect in 40 years,

2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:09.200
 we're not going to know for 40 years.

2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:11.040
 Yeah, so I think if I were to speak,

2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:13.920
 because I talked to, like I mentioned offline

2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:15.920
 to Joe Rogan and his podcast yesterday,

2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:18.760
 I talked to him all the time about this.

2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:28.440
 I think the concern is less about the long term effects, like on paper.

2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:34.520
 It's more about the, like people like Anthony Fauci

2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:39.120
 and people at the top are simply misrepresenting the data

2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:43.000
 or like are not accurately being transparent,

2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:45.040
 not collecting the data properly,

2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:46.800
 not reporting on the data properly,

2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:50.480
 not being transparent, not representing the uncertainties,

2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:55.760
 not openly saying they were wrong two months ago.

2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:58.080
 Like in a way that's not like dramatic,

2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:00.960
 but revealing the basic process of science

2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:03.720
 when you have to do your best under uncertainty,

2:02:03.720 --> 2:02:06.040
 just also just being inauthentic.

2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:09.720
 There's a sense, especially with like a younger generation now,

2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:11.680
 there's a certain way on the internet,

2:02:11.680 --> 2:02:14.280
 like the internet can smell bullshit,

2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:16.920
 much better than previous generations could.

2:02:16.920 --> 2:02:21.720
 And so they see there's a kind of inauthenticity

2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:26.440
 that comes with being like representing authority.

2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:30.440
 Like I am a scientist, I'm an expert, I have a PhD,

2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:31.880
 I have four decades of work,

2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:34.040
 therefore everyone should listen to me.

2:02:34.040 --> 2:02:40.720
 And somehow that maps to this feeling of, well, what are they hiding?

2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:43.080
 If they're speaking from authority like this,

2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:45.680
 if everyone is in agreement like this,

2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:48.080
 that means they all have emails between each other.

2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:49.440
 They said, we're going to tell this,

2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:51.800
 this is the message we're going to tell the public.

2:02:51.800 --> 2:02:54.840
 Then what is the truth, the actual truth?

2:02:54.840 --> 2:02:57.200
 Maybe there's a much bigger uncertainty.

2:02:57.200 --> 2:02:59.920
 Maybe there's dead people in the basement

2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:03.840
 that they're hiding from bad mRNA vaccine experiments.

2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:06.680
 Maybe they're, and then the conspiracy theories

2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:09.120
 start to grow naturally

2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:11.840
 when there's this kind of mistrust of that.

2:03:11.840 --> 2:03:17.160
 So it's less about kind of like a deep concern

2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:18.960
 about long term effects.

2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:24.640
 It's a concern about long term effects

2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:27.080
 if we find out that there's some secret stuff

2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:28.400
 that we're not being told.

2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:30.040
 It all runs on that.

2:03:30.040 --> 2:03:33.360
 So I put the blame not on the data,

2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:37.000
 but basically on the leaders and the communicators

2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:39.240
 of the science at the top.

2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:42.360
 Well, to that I would say,

2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:47.080
 all the data, as far as I know, are made public.

2:03:47.080 --> 2:03:48.760
 So you can dive into it.

2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:51.520
 And I know a lot of people ask me questions,

2:03:51.520 --> 2:03:54.120
 and I just say it's right here in the data.

2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:55.800
 And I know a lot of people can't do that.

2:03:55.800 --> 2:03:57.440
 They can't dive into it.

2:03:57.440 --> 2:04:00.320
 But that's one solution for people who are able.

2:04:00.320 --> 2:04:03.440
 Now you could argue, well, maybe they've left data out.

2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:05.480
 Well, then not even I can help,

2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:07.160
 because then they're hiding it from me too.

2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:08.560
 And I think that's highly unlikely.

2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:09.920
 I think for the most part,

2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:14.280
 the FDA requires the release of all the clinical trial data.

2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:17.600
 So this clinical trial data, that's one thing.

2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:19.920
 So that's the data that we should be focusing on, right?

2:04:19.920 --> 2:04:24.160
 So there's a lot of different data sets here.

2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:25.720
 So there's preclinical data,

2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:28.280
 which is everything that was done in the lab

2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:30.920
 before this vaccine ever went into a human arm.

2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:32.240
 It's all the cell culture work

2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:35.880
 that we talked about a little, experiments in animals.

2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:38.360
 All of that is publicly accessible.

2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:39.960
 Most of it gets published.

2:04:39.960 --> 2:04:42.560
 And then there's the initial drug filing,

2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:45.080
 which is huge, the books have died.

2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:46.960
 You can get that and look at it, right?

2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:49.880
 This is me sort of asking sort of difficult questions here.

2:04:49.880 --> 2:04:50.720
 It's okay.

2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:56.080
 So there's a lot of money to be made by makers of the vaccine.

2:04:57.080 --> 2:04:59.760
 So for these companies,

2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:02.480
 and obviously there's a distress of those folks too.

2:05:02.480 --> 2:05:04.560
 They've done a lot of really good things in this world,

2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:07.400
 but the incentives are such

2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:09.960
 that you wanna sweep stuff under the rug

2:05:09.960 --> 2:05:14.960
 if you're not 100% pure in your ethics.

2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:20.440
 And how hard is it for that data to be fabricated,

2:05:21.160 --> 2:05:24.520
 manipulated, like what's your intuition

2:05:24.520 --> 2:05:26.120
 for the pre trial stuff?

2:05:26.120 --> 2:05:29.040
 I think when you start fabricating,

2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:31.400
 then you get inconsistencies,

2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:34.400
 which are pretty easy to pick up.

2:05:34.400 --> 2:05:38.040
 When you're talking about some large scale things of this nature.

2:05:38.040 --> 2:05:40.960
 Because then you can look through the data very,

2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:43.680
 you're gonna, I mean, we require looking very carefully,

2:05:43.680 --> 2:05:46.880
 but you'll see inconsistencies from one trial to another.

2:05:46.880 --> 2:05:50.800
 And that may ring a bell that something's been done.

2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:51.640
 Yeah.

2:05:52.680 --> 2:05:54.400
 It's like the moon landing thing.

2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:57.040
 I think sometimes like going to the moon

2:05:57.040 --> 2:05:59.840
 is easier than faking it, right?

2:05:59.840 --> 2:06:03.400
 In the sense it might be easier to do a large scale trial

2:06:03.400 --> 2:06:06.000
 and get an effective vaccine versus faking it.

2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:08.360
 But you know, when you brought up the for profit issue,

2:06:08.360 --> 2:06:11.400
 I think that is always been an issue.

2:06:11.400 --> 2:06:15.800
 I've always felt that having your health depend

2:06:15.800 --> 2:06:20.040
 on for profit industry may not be the best solution.

2:06:21.720 --> 2:06:23.200
 And I don't know how else to do it.

2:06:23.200 --> 2:06:26.360
 People tell me I'm a dreamer that thinking that,

2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:28.320
 you know, all medicines could be nonprofit,

2:06:28.320 --> 2:06:31.400
 but I also think that the world should have one health system

2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:32.800
 that takes care of everyone, right?

2:06:32.800 --> 2:06:34.720
 Because there are some countries that can't

2:06:34.720 --> 2:06:37.600
 and other countries haven't access like us.

2:06:37.600 --> 2:06:40.240
 So I wish we could do that.

2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:44.160
 Well, the argument is the speed of which the vaccines

2:06:44.160 --> 2:06:47.440
 for COVID were produced would never happen

2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:49.200
 in a nonprofit system,

2:06:49.200 --> 2:06:51.720
 would never happen in a non capitalist system.

2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:56.120
 Oh, I could set up a vaccine production institute

2:06:56.120 --> 2:06:58.920
 in the US that would get the vaccines done

2:06:58.920 --> 2:07:00.920
 because you just need to put money into it.

2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:02.960
 That's what made these vaccines get done.

2:07:02.960 --> 2:07:05.200
 Money, they poured billions of dollars

2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:07.000
 and they got it done quickly.

2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:09.760
 But if I set up a nonprofit institutes of vaccines

2:07:09.760 --> 2:07:12.560
 throughout the US, staffed with really talented people,

2:07:12.560 --> 2:07:15.080
 pay them well, keep them motivated,

2:07:15.080 --> 2:07:15.920
 you'll get your vaccines.

2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:18.560
 No, but that's the thing with capitalism

2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:22.880
 is that the selection of who to hire a good,

2:07:22.880 --> 2:07:24.760
 when you say good people,

2:07:24.760 --> 2:07:28.200
 the capitalist has a machine that fires people

2:07:28.200 --> 2:07:30.760
 who are not good and selects people that are good.

2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:32.680
 Coming from the Soviet Union,

2:07:32.680 --> 2:07:36.480
 the dream of communism is similar to what you're saying,

2:07:36.480 --> 2:07:37.360
 broadly defy.

2:07:37.360 --> 2:07:40.040
 It certainly doesn't work in the broads,

2:07:40.040 --> 2:07:45.040
 the question of whether it works in the healthcare space.

2:07:45.080 --> 2:07:49.520
 You know, there is some aspect to the machine of capitalism

2:07:49.520 --> 2:07:53.280
 being the most effective way to select for good people

2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:56.040
 to effectively produce the thing.

2:07:56.040 --> 2:07:58.520
 But then of course, a lot of people would argue

2:07:58.520 --> 2:08:02.440
 that even the current healthcare is not with regulations.

2:08:02.440 --> 2:08:03.680
 There's some weird mix

2:08:03.680 --> 2:08:07.080
 where there's a lot of opportunities for inefficiencies.

2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:09.040
 There's a lot of opportunities for bureaucracy.

2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:11.880
 So you have like the worst of all the world.

2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:14.040
 Can't there be some intermediate that works?

2:08:14.040 --> 2:08:17.280
 Because I mean, the other issue that we have mentioned

2:08:17.280 --> 2:08:19.280
 is that politics gets thrown into this

2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:21.400
 and that really messes up

2:08:21.400 --> 2:08:23.000
 and it should never be mixed with healthcare,

2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:26.840
 but it is because a lot of funding comes from the government.

2:08:26.840 --> 2:08:29.320
 So that's another confounding factor.

2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:33.680
 But I really think I could make a vaccine institute

2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:36.640
 that if someone didn't do well, I'd fire them.

2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:39.120
 No, you're not gonna stay if you can't do your job

2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:41.400
 and do it well, you don't give them incentives,

2:08:41.400 --> 2:08:44.120
 but it doesn't have to be the two extremes, I think.

2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:45.840
 It has to be a solution

2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:48.960
 that people don't have this mistrust

2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:52.440
 for a company making huge profits off of a drug.

2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:53.280
 But you know what?

2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:57.440
 It's funny, it seems that vaccines and antivirals

2:08:57.440 --> 2:08:59.520
 bear the brunt of this criticism,

2:08:59.520 --> 2:09:01.320
 yet there are many other pharmaceuticals

2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:04.360
 that people rely on of all sorts.

2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:06.760
 They don't seem to question and have issues with those

2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:09.200
 and they have far more side effects than vaccines.

2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:11.920
 It's very strange how we're picking that way.

2:09:11.920 --> 2:09:16.920
 But I should also say that if you have one big vaccine

2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:21.920
 institute, one of the other sets of vaccine conspiracies,

2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:29.680
 I mean, I would say they're a little farther out

2:09:29.680 --> 2:09:32.440
 into the wild set of ideas.

2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:37.200
 But there's one way to control the populace

2:09:37.200 --> 2:09:41.120
 is by injecting substances into them, right?

2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:44.840
 People, I mean, part of that, funny enough,

2:09:44.840 --> 2:09:47.400
 this probably has to do with needles versus

2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:48.960
 something you put in your mouth.

2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:50.840
 But there's something about the government,

2:09:50.840 --> 2:09:52.920
 especially when it's government mandated,

2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:54.960
 injection of a substance into you.

2:09:56.520 --> 2:09:57.840
 I don't care what the science says,

2:09:57.840 --> 2:10:01.000
 if it's 100% effective, 100% safe,

2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:04.320
 there's a natural distrust of what,

2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:07.720
 even if this is effective and safe,

2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:12.000
 giving the government power to do this,

2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.400
 aren't they gonna start getting ideas down the line

2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:19.400
 for, I think that they can barely govern.

2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:22.200
 I don't think they're gonna do that,

2:10:22.200 --> 2:10:26.000
 but you don't have to take, unless you're a federal employee,

2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:27.920
 you don't have to take a COVID vaccine.

2:10:27.920 --> 2:10:32.920
 Yeah, but that largely has to do, not largely,

2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:37.960
 but there is an individualistic spirit to the American people.

2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:42.960
 There's this, like, you're not gonna take my gun away from me.

2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:46.000
 Sure.

2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:47.400
 You're not going, and I think that,

2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:56.080
 that's something that makes America what it is.

2:10:56.080 --> 2:10:57.480
 Just coming from the Soviet Union,

2:10:57.480 --> 2:10:59.920
 there's a power to sort of resisting

2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:01.720
 the overreach of government.

2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:02.920
 That's quite interesting,

2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:06.760
 because I'm a believer, I hope that it's possible

2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:10.360
 to have, to strive towards a government

2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:11.600
 that works extremely well.

2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:14.840
 I think at its best, a government represents the people

2:11:14.840 --> 2:11:17.880
 and functions in a similar way that you're mentioning,

2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:20.160
 but that, like, pushback,

2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:22.600
 even if it turns into conspiracy theories sometimes,

2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:25.960
 I think is actually healthy in the long arc of history.

2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:28.080
 It can be frustrating sometimes,

2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:30.920
 but that mechanism of pushing back against power,

2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:33.000
 against authority, it can be healthy.

2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:34.080
 I agree.

2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:36.520
 I think it's fine to question the vaccines.

2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:39.040
 What I have issue with is that many people

2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:43.200
 put out incorrect information,

2:11:43.200 --> 2:11:45.400
 and I'm not sure what their motivations are,

2:11:45.400 --> 2:11:47.040
 and it's very hard to fight that,

2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:50.120
 because then it's my word versus theirs,

2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:52.360
 and I'm happy to talk with people

2:11:52.360 --> 2:11:54.320
 about any of their concerns,

2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:56.720
 but if you start getting into the stuff

2:11:56.720 --> 2:11:59.240
 that just isn't true, then we have a problem.

2:11:59.240 --> 2:12:03.360
 The thing I struggle with is conspiracy theories,

2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:04.680
 whatever language you wanna use,

2:12:04.680 --> 2:12:09.680
 but sort of ideas that challenge the mainstream,

2:12:10.800 --> 2:12:12.080
 quote, unquote, narrative,

2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:16.160
 given our current social media and internet,

2:12:16.160 --> 2:12:17.840
 like the way it operates,

2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:20.320
 they can become viral much easier.

2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:22.720
 There's something much more compelling about them.

2:12:22.720 --> 2:12:27.720
 Like, I have a secret about the way things really work.

2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:30.200
 That becomes viral, and that's very frustrating,

2:12:30.200 --> 2:12:32.440
 because then you're not having a conversation

2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:36.840
 on level ground, when you're trying

2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:38.320
 to present scientific ideas,

2:12:38.320 --> 2:12:39.880
 and then there's conspiracy theories,

2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:42.840
 the conspiracy theories become viral much faster,

2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:44.880
 and then you're not just having a discussion

2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:49.240
 on level ground, that's the frustrating part,

2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:51.920
 that it's not an even discussion.

2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:53.040
 Can I just say one more thing?

2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:54.880
 So, I mean, the internet is here to stay,

2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:57.320
 so we're gonna have to figure out how to deal with it, right?

2:12:57.320 --> 2:13:00.200
 But from my perspective, I was skeptical

2:13:00.200 --> 2:13:03.040
 that these mRNA vaccines, that any COVID vaccine

2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:05.880
 would be ready within a year.

2:13:05.880 --> 2:13:06.720
 That's amazing.

2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:07.560
 Me too.

2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:12.360
 Plus, the way I look at the mRNA vaccine as a scientist,

2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:13.920
 it's gee whiz to me.

2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:15.560
 That's amazing that it worked,

2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:18.640
 and I think the data are great, so I want it.

2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:21.240
 As a scientist, I want it.

2:13:21.240 --> 2:13:23.880
 One of the really sad things again with me too,

2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:26.760
 as a scientist or as an admirer of science,

2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:31.280
 is I don't know if it's politics,

2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:34.960
 but one of the sad things to me about the previous year

2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:38.440
 is that I wasn't free to celebrate

2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:42.400
 the incredible accomplishment of science with the vaccines.

2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:44.160
 I was very skeptical as possible

2:13:44.160 --> 2:13:47.680
 to develop a vaccine so quickly.

2:13:47.680 --> 2:13:50.760
 So, it's unfortunate that we can't celebrate

2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:54.120
 how amazing humans are to come up with this vaccine.

2:13:54.120 --> 2:13:57.320
 Now, this vaccine might have long term effects.

2:13:57.320 --> 2:13:59.440
 That doesn't mean this is not incredible.

2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:04.320
 Why couldn't you celebrate?

2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:08.640
 Because I would love to inspire the world

2:14:08.640 --> 2:14:11.360
 with the amazing things science can do.

2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:14.000
 And when you say something about the vaccines,

2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:15.640
 they're not listening to the science.

2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:17.440
 A lot of people are not listening to the science.

2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:22.440
 What they hear is, oh, you're a Republican

2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:25.160
 or you're a Democrat and you're social signaling us

2:14:25.160 --> 2:14:26.680
 and doing some kind of signaling.

2:14:26.680 --> 2:14:27.800
 No, I think that the vaccine,

2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:30.640
 you're talking about injecting something into you

2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:33.720
 and maybe you're right that the rhetoric is like,

2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:37.120
 you better take this or you're dumb,

2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:38.480
 is not the right approach.

2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:40.200
 I've seen, actually, it's kind of interesting.

2:14:40.200 --> 2:14:42.960
 I've seen both sides kind of imply that.

2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:47.800
 So, the people who are against the vaccine

2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:52.360
 are dumb for not trusting science

2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:55.680
 and the people who are for the vaccine

2:14:55.680 --> 2:14:59.360
 are called dumb for trusting science,

2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:00.200
 the scientific institutions.

2:15:00.200 --> 2:15:01.800
 And nobody wins, yeah.

2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:03.960
 And they both kind of have a point.

2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:07.720
 Like, because you can always,

2:15:07.720 --> 2:15:10.240
 it's like a glass half full or half empty

2:15:10.240 --> 2:15:15.240
 because you can always look at like science

2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:18.120
 from a perspective of certain individuals

2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:23.120
 that don't represent perhaps are not greatest leaders,

2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:25.320
 almost like political leaders.

2:15:25.320 --> 2:15:27.640
 There's a lot of, you know,

2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:31.240
 yesterday went on a whole rant against,

2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:34.080
 I said a lot of positive things about Anthony Fauci

2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:35.840
 before I went on a rant against him.

2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:40.000
 Because ultimately, you know,

2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:41.960
 I think he failed as a leader

2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:44.240
 and I know it's very difficult to be a leader

2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:47.320
 but I still wanted to hold him accountable for that.

2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:50.440
 As a great communicator of science and as a great leader.

2:15:50.440 --> 2:15:52.280
 But what do you think he didn't do right?

2:15:52.280 --> 2:15:53.120
 I'm curious.

2:15:55.040 --> 2:16:00.040
 So, the core of the problem is the several characteristics

2:16:04.040 --> 2:16:06.520
 of the way he was communicating to the public.

2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:09.120
 So, one is the general inauthenticity.

2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:14.480
 Two is a thing that it's very hard to put into words

2:16:14.480 --> 2:16:18.680
 but there are certain ways of speaking to people

2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:21.720
 that sounds like you're hiding something from them.

2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:23.960
 That sounds like you're full of shit.

2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:25.480
 That's the authenticity piece.

2:16:25.480 --> 2:16:30.480
 Like it sounds like you're not really speaking

2:16:30.600 --> 2:16:34.480
 to the full truth of what you know

2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:38.400
 and that you did some shady shit in your past

2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:40.840
 that you're trying to hide.

2:16:40.840 --> 2:16:42.800
 So, that's a way of communicating

2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:45.040
 that I think the internet and people in general

2:16:45.040 --> 2:16:46.720
 are becoming much better at detecting.

2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:48.600
 Yeah, as you said, they're good BS detectors.

2:16:48.600 --> 2:16:50.160
 Yeah, good BS detectors.

2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:55.600
 But contributing to that is speaking from authority.

2:16:55.600 --> 2:17:00.600
 Speaking with authority and confidence

2:17:01.520 --> 2:17:04.440
 where neither is deserved.

2:17:04.440 --> 2:17:09.440
 So, first of all, nobody's an authority on this new virus.

2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:12.160
 Right, we're facing a deadly pandemic

2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:15.200
 and especially in the early stages

2:17:15.200 --> 2:17:17.480
 it was unclear how deadly it would be.

2:17:17.480 --> 2:17:19.600
 It was unclear, probably still unclear,

2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:22.040
 fully how it's transmitted.

2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:24.320
 The full dynamics of the virus,

2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:28.440
 the full understanding of which solutions work and not,

2:17:28.440 --> 2:17:31.160
 how well masks of different kinds work,

2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:34.200
 how easy or difficult it is to create tests,

2:17:34.200 --> 2:17:36.400
 how many months or years it's gonna take

2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:37.680
 to create a vaccine,

2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:42.680
 how well in history or currently do quarantine methods

2:17:43.160 --> 2:17:44.640
 or lockdown methods work.

2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:48.080
 What are the different data mechanisms

2:17:48.080 --> 2:17:50.600
 that are data collection mechanisms

2:17:50.600 --> 2:17:52.080
 that are being implemented?

2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:55.720
 What are the clear plans they need to happen?

2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:58.400
 What the epidemiology that's happening,

2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:00.200
 what is the uncertainty around that?

2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:06.440
 Then there's the geopolitical stuff with China.

2:18:06.440 --> 2:18:10.920
 Like what, I personally believe

2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:12.640
 there should have been much more openness

2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:15.320
 about the origins of the virus,

2:18:15.320 --> 2:18:17.120
 whether a leak from a lab or not.

2:18:17.120 --> 2:18:21.200
 I think communicating that you're open to these ideas

2:18:21.200 --> 2:18:25.360
 is actually the way to get people to trust you,

2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:28.240
 that you're legitimately open to ideas

2:18:28.240 --> 2:18:31.280
 that are very unpleasant that go against the mainstream.

2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:35.160
 Showing that openness is going to get people

2:18:35.160 --> 2:18:38.880
 to trust you when you finally decrease

2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:41.000
 the variance in your uncertainty,

2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:42.840
 like decrease uncertainty and have,

2:18:42.840 --> 2:18:44.440
 we still have a lot of uncertainty,

2:18:44.440 --> 2:18:46.480
 but this is the best course of action.

2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:49.680
 Vaccines still have a lot of uncertainty around them.

2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:51.280
 mRNA is a new technology,

2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:53.320
 but we have increasing amounts of data

2:18:53.320 --> 2:18:54.960
 and here's the data sources

2:18:54.960 --> 2:18:58.760
 and like laying them out in a very clear way

2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:01.280
 of this is the best course of action that we have now.

2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:04.080
 We don't know if it's the perfect course of action,

2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:06.400
 but it's by far the best course of action.

2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:09.480
 And that would come from a leader

2:19:09.480 --> 2:19:13.040
 that has earned the capital of trust from people.

2:19:13.040 --> 2:19:15.920
 I mean, I think in recent history,

2:19:15.920 --> 2:19:19.760
 the worst pandemic is 1918 flu, right?

2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:22.600
 But that's mainly because we didn't know what to do.

2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:24.440
 We didn't have many tools at our disposal.

2:19:24.440 --> 2:19:26.440
 And that was tied up with World War I.

2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:27.960
 That's right, that's right.

2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:30.320
 So the leadership there, I mean.

2:19:30.320 --> 2:19:32.880
 But I don't know what is a lot of deaths, right?

2:19:32.880 --> 2:19:35.480
 And any one person is someone's family.

2:19:35.480 --> 2:19:37.520
 So to them, it's a lot, right?

2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:41.800
 But that logic, we don't apply that logic generally

2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:43.480
 because there's a lot of people suffering

2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:44.960
 and dying throughout the world.

2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:47.880
 And we turn the other way all the time.

2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:49.200
 And that's the story of history.

2:19:49.200 --> 2:19:51.640
 So saying you all of a sudden.

2:19:51.640 --> 2:19:52.640
 Well, bothers me though.

2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:56.280
 I mean, personally, I don't like anyone dying anywhere,

2:19:56.280 --> 2:20:00.200
 but especially considering what technology

2:20:00.200 --> 2:20:02.440
 we're able to muster yet we still kill each other.

2:20:02.440 --> 2:20:04.600
 It's just dichotomy to me.

2:20:04.600 --> 2:20:06.680
 Yeah, but I mean, this is the, what is it?

2:20:06.680 --> 2:20:10.240
 Paul Farmer, there's these great stories.

2:20:10.240 --> 2:20:15.240
 I mean, that's the burden of being in healthcare,

2:20:17.480 --> 2:20:22.480
 being a doctor is you have to help.

2:20:23.080 --> 2:20:25.280
 You can't help but help a person in front of you

2:20:25.280 --> 2:20:26.120
 who's hurting.

2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:26.960
 Sure.

2:20:26.960 --> 2:20:30.120
 But you also are burdened by the knowledge

2:20:30.120 --> 2:20:32.640
 that you helping them, you spending money

2:20:32.640 --> 2:20:35.800
 and effort and time on them means you're not going

2:20:35.800 --> 2:20:38.560
 to help others and you cannot possibly allocate

2:20:38.560 --> 2:20:40.240
 that amount of time to everybody.

2:20:40.240 --> 2:20:42.240
 So you're choosing which person lives

2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:43.720
 and which person dies.

2:20:43.720 --> 2:20:44.560
 Sure.

2:20:44.560 --> 2:20:46.480
 And you're doing so, the reason you're helping

2:20:46.480 --> 2:20:48.440
 the person in front of you is because they're

2:20:48.440 --> 2:20:49.440
 in front of you.

2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:53.320
 And so the reason right now, we care a lot about COVID

2:20:53.320 --> 2:20:56.680
 is because the eye of the world has turned to COVID,

2:20:56.680 --> 2:20:59.320
 but we're not seeing all the other atrocities

2:20:59.320 --> 2:21:00.480
 going on in the world.

2:21:00.480 --> 2:21:02.800
 They're not necessarily related to deaths,

2:21:02.800 --> 2:21:05.280
 they're related to suffering, human suffering,

2:21:05.280 --> 2:21:07.400
 which you could argue is worse than death,

2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:08.680
 prolonged suffering.

2:21:08.680 --> 2:21:09.520
 Of course.

2:21:09.520 --> 2:21:11.640
 So there's all of these questions.

2:21:11.640 --> 2:21:15.760
 And the fundamental question here is,

2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:19.360
 are we overreacting to COVID in our policies?

2:21:19.360 --> 2:21:24.040
 So this is the, when we turn our eye and care

2:21:24.040 --> 2:21:26.920
 about this particular thing and not other things,

2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:29.200
 are we dismissing the pain that business owners

2:21:29.200 --> 2:21:31.640
 who've lost their businesses are going to feel?

2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:35.560
 And then the long, talking about long COVID,

2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:39.400
 the long term economic effects on the millions

2:21:39.400 --> 2:21:42.480
 of people that will suffer, that suffer financially,

2:21:42.480 --> 2:21:44.840
 but also suffer from their dreams

2:21:44.840 --> 2:21:46.680
 being completely collapsed.

2:21:46.680 --> 2:21:50.720
 So a lot of people seek gain meaning from work.

2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:52.840
 And if you take away that work,

2:21:52.840 --> 2:21:55.680
 there's anger that can be born, there's pain.

2:21:55.680 --> 2:21:57.200
 And so what does that lead to?

2:21:57.200 --> 2:22:01.840
 That can lead to the rising up of charismatic leaders

2:22:01.840 --> 2:22:05.080
 that channel that anger towards destructive things

2:22:05.080 --> 2:22:06.720
 that's been done throughout history.

2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:10.200
 So you have to balance that with the policies

2:22:10.200 --> 2:22:12.040
 that you have in COVID.

2:22:12.040 --> 2:22:16.200
 And then, I mean, very much my main opposition

2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:20.680
 to Fauci is not on the details, but the final result,

2:22:20.680 --> 2:22:25.000
 which is I just observe that there's a significant decrease

2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:30.000
 in trust in science as not the institution,

2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:32.720
 but the various sort of mechanisms of science.

2:22:32.720 --> 2:22:35.880
 I think science is both beautiful and powerful.

2:22:35.880 --> 2:22:38.240
 And the reason why we have so many amazing things

2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:42.600
 and such a high quality of life and distrust in that,

2:22:42.600 --> 2:22:45.400
 that the thing we need now to get out of all the troubles

2:22:45.400 --> 2:22:48.560
 we're in, continue getting out of the troubles we're in

2:22:48.560 --> 2:22:51.840
 is science, the scientific process broadly defined

2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:54.400
 like innovation, technological innovation,

2:22:54.400 --> 2:22:56.520
 scientific innovation, all of that.

2:22:57.400 --> 2:23:02.480
 Distrust in that is totally the wrong thing we need.

2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:07.480
 And so anybody who causes a distrust in science to me,

2:23:12.240 --> 2:23:14.240
 carries the responsibility of that

2:23:14.240 --> 2:23:18.440
 and should be, because the response should be fired,

2:23:18.440 --> 2:23:23.280
 should be or at least openly have to carry

2:23:23.280 --> 2:23:25.720
 the burden of that, of having caused

2:23:25.720 --> 2:23:27.480
 of that kind of level of mistrust.

2:23:27.480 --> 2:23:30.520
 Now, it's maybe unfair to place it on any one individual,

2:23:30.520 --> 2:23:34.120
 but you have to, I think in your pocket said,

2:23:34.120 --> 2:23:38.320
 the buck stops at the top, like the leaders have to care.

2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:41.000
 There's a clear leader here, yes, absolutely.

2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:44.120
 So even if it's not directly his fault,

2:23:44.120 --> 2:23:48.400
 he has to carry the price of that.

2:23:48.400 --> 2:23:50.880
 Do you think we should at this point say,

2:23:50.880 --> 2:23:54.360
 okay, we have vaccines, you can decide

2:23:54.360 --> 2:23:57.440
 whether you take them or not, let's move forward?

2:23:57.440 --> 2:23:59.200
 Maybe you can help me understand this

2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:04.200
 because it seems like, why is that not the right solution?

2:24:04.560 --> 2:24:06.360
 Completely open society.

2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:09.800
 The vaccines, at least in the United States,

2:24:09.800 --> 2:24:14.160
 as I understand, are widely available.

2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:16.760
 So this is the American way.

2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:18.360
 You have the decision to make.

2:24:18.360 --> 2:24:22.520
 If you have conditions that make you worried

2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:24.760
 to get COVID and go to the hospital,

2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:26.200
 then you should get vaccinated.

2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:27.840
 Because here's the data that shows

2:24:27.840 --> 2:24:30.920
 that it's much less likely for you to die.

2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:35.800
 If you get vaccinated, if you don't want to get vaccinated

2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:39.360
 because you're worried about a longterm effects of vaccine

2:24:39.360 --> 2:24:41.360
 that you don't have to, but then you'll suffer

2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:44.480
 the consequences of that, and that's it.

2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:47.280
 So here's what I think is driving.

2:24:47.280 --> 2:24:48.680
 I think it's all about kids,

2:24:50.240 --> 2:24:52.000
 because they're gonna go back to school in the fall

2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000
 and many of them can't be vaccinated.

2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:59.000
 So if they get infected, they do have less frequency

2:24:59.040 --> 2:25:01.240
 of disease, but it's not zero.

2:25:01.240 --> 2:25:04.720
 They do get sick and they can have longterm consequences.

2:25:04.720 --> 2:25:09.320
 And at that age, it would be a shame, right?

2:25:09.320 --> 2:25:10.600
 And not even their choice.

2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:13.440
 They can't decide to get vaccinated or not

2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:15.200
 because they can't have access to it.

2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:19.400
 So I think that's what would drive my efforts

2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:22.560
 to try and get more people, at least in schools vaccinated,

2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:23.760
 but I might be wrong.

2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:24.920
 It may not be that.

2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:26.560
 Can you kind of dig into that a little bit?

2:25:26.560 --> 2:25:31.560
 So you're saying that there should be an effort

2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:37.600
 for increased vaccinations of kids going to school,

2:25:37.600 --> 2:25:39.880
 just not for societal benefit,

2:25:39.880 --> 2:25:42.280
 but for the benefit of each individual kid, right?

2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:46.160
 So right now, kids under 12, right,

2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:48.560
 are not yet vaccinated, is that correct?

2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:49.960
 Yeah, I think so.

2:25:49.960 --> 2:25:53.480
 And it's not gonna be in time for school opening

2:25:53.480 --> 2:25:54.840
 that they get vaccinated.

2:25:56.760 --> 2:26:01.440
 And then, I suppose the teachers are all gonna be vaccinated.

2:26:01.440 --> 2:26:02.840
 Makes sense for them to do that,

2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:04.160
 but I'm just worried the kids

2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:06.040
 are gonna be transmitting it amongst them.

2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:08.960
 And many states don't allow mask mandate in school.

2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:13.960
 So I think that's what's driving the larger narrative

2:26:14.080 --> 2:26:16.760
 in the US to protect kids.

2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:19.840
 It's kind of what I hear from Daniel Griffin,

2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:21.680
 because increasing numbers of kids

2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:24.040
 are being admitted to hospitals now,

2:26:24.040 --> 2:26:28.320
 because they're becoming the major unvaccinated population.

2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:29.680
 They're hanging out over the summer,

2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:32.320
 and that's just gonna get worse in the fall.

2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:35.480
 And so you could have a lot of kids with long COVID

2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:37.480
 and disabled their entire lives, right?

2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:39.320
 So... And of course,

2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:42.120
 hearing from people who are vaccine hesitant,

2:26:42.120 --> 2:26:44.880
 I hear exactly the kids statement,

2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:49.880
 but they're saying they don't want the long vaccine,

2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:53.280
 the long term effects of the vaccine to affect the kids.

2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:56.040
 That's the, of this new vaccine.

2:26:56.040 --> 2:26:58.680
 Which I would say is, as I said before,

2:26:58.680 --> 2:27:00.680
 you can't say never,

2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:05.680
 but we do know that long COVID exists.

2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:06.920
 We don't know for how long,

2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:09.360
 because we've only looked out six or eight months.

2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:12.480
 We know that exists, and the frequency is increasing.

2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:14.320
 It certainly exists in young kids,

2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:16.640
 and we have no idea about long vaccine effects.

2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:20.680
 So I think they have to make their decision based on that.

2:27:22.880 --> 2:27:24.480
 But yeah.

2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:28.240
 But your question is, why don't we just open up society?

2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:29.640
 So here we have these vaccines,

2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:30.840
 if you want to protect yourself.

2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:32.200
 I think it's mainly the school

2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:34.360
 that's driving the whole narrative.

2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:35.360
 That's my opinion.

2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:37.800
 In which direction not to open up, or?

2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:40.680
 No, to open up, but to try and get,

2:27:40.680 --> 2:27:42.320
 there are efforts at the federal level

2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:44.000
 to get people vaccinated, right?

2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000
 But see, how high are the risk for kids?

2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.080
 I mean, as my understanding was,

2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:50.560
 I mean, yes, it's non zero, but it's very low.

2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:53.680
 But what is the numbers?

2:27:53.680 --> 2:27:58.360
 Now, 70,000 hospitalizations so far in kids

2:27:58.360 --> 2:27:59.800
 as of last week.

2:27:59.800 --> 2:28:04.800
 So yes, it's low, but polio was low.

2:28:05.480 --> 2:28:08.840
 Polio was 20, 30,000 kids a year paralyzed.

2:28:08.840 --> 2:28:11.560
 And well, many people have actually argued

2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:13.920
 that that vaccine wasn't necessary, you know?

2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:17.200
 That wasn't a substantial enough health problem.

2:28:17.200 --> 2:28:19.040
 But paralyze is different than hospital.

2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:20.920
 So what does hospitalized mean?

2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:21.760
 Long COVID.

2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:23.040
 But this is the long COVID question.

2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:24.600
 I mean, this is the open question.

2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:26.440
 What is long COVID in kids?

2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:27.280
 What is that?

2:28:27.280 --> 2:28:32.280
 Well, a lot of the same issues, cognitive issues,

2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:37.320
 motor issues, respiratory, GI dysfunction.

2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:39.240
 How long?

2:28:39.240 --> 2:28:40.080
 We don't know.

2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:43.200
 I mean, it could end in a year.

2:28:43.200 --> 2:28:47.400
 As you know, there are other post acute infectious sequelae

2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:50.960
 that we know about, you know, chronic fatigue, ME, CFS.

2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:53.160
 It's thought to be a post infectious sequelae,

2:28:53.160 --> 2:28:55.080
 which has gone for many decades now

2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:56.480
 in many millions of people.

2:28:56.480 --> 2:28:58.680
 This could be another one of those.

2:28:58.680 --> 2:29:02.680
 So I'm just saying it might be worth airing on the side

2:29:02.680 --> 2:29:05.840
 of not letting the kids getting infected.

2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:09.840
 Yeah, but well, I'm trying to keep an open mind here

2:29:09.840 --> 2:29:12.040
 and I appreciate you doing the same.

2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:17.040
 Of course, I lean on definitely not requiring

2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:19.280
 people to get vaccinated,

2:29:19.280 --> 2:29:24.280
 but I do think getting vaccinated is just the wiser choice

2:29:24.280 --> 2:29:28.480
 of looking at all the different trajectories before us.

2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:33.280
 Getting vaccinated is seems like from the data,

2:29:33.280 --> 2:29:35.560
 it seems like the obvious choice, frankly.

2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:38.120
 But I'm also trying to keep an open mind

2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:40.160
 because some things in the past that seemed obvious

2:29:40.160 --> 2:29:42.120
 would turn out to be completely wrong.

2:29:42.120 --> 2:29:44.880
 So I'm trying to keep an open mind here.

2:29:44.880 --> 2:29:48.680
 So for example, one of the things I'd love

2:29:48.680 --> 2:29:53.000
 to get your thoughts on this is antiviral ideas.

2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:55.040
 So ideas outside of the vaccine.

2:29:56.040 --> 2:30:00.440
 So Ivermectin, something that Brett Weinstein

2:30:00.440 --> 2:30:02.120
 and a few others have been talking about.

2:30:02.120 --> 2:30:03.200
 There's been a few studies,

2:30:03.200 --> 2:30:07.160
 some of them have been shown not to be very good studies,

2:30:07.160 --> 2:30:11.520
 but nevertheless, there seems to be some promise.

2:30:11.520 --> 2:30:16.560
 And I wanted to talk to Brett about this particular topic

2:30:16.560 --> 2:30:17.400
 for two reasons.

2:30:17.400 --> 2:30:19.960
 One, I was really bothered by censorship of this.

2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:22.080
 That's a whole nother topic.

2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:25.960
 I just, I'm bothered by censorship.

2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:27.520
 There's a gray area, of course,

2:30:28.720 --> 2:30:31.000
 but it just feels like

2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:33.080
 that should not have been censored from YouTube,

2:30:33.080 --> 2:30:34.880
 like discussions of Ivermectin.

2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:36.760
 We can set that aside.

2:30:36.760 --> 2:30:41.760
 The other thing, I was bothered by the lack of open mindedness

2:30:42.080 --> 2:30:46.760
 on exploring things like Ivermectin in the early days,

2:30:46.760 --> 2:30:49.600
 especially when at least I thought the vaccine

2:30:49.600 --> 2:30:51.680
 would take a long time.

2:30:51.680 --> 2:30:53.160
 I mean, it's not just Ivermectin,

2:30:53.160 --> 2:30:57.480
 it's really seriously at a large scale,

2:30:57.480 --> 2:31:01.360
 rigorously exploring the effectiveness of masks

2:31:01.360 --> 2:31:03.680
 and the big one for me is testing.

2:31:03.680 --> 2:31:07.040
 Like the fact that that wasn't explored aggressively

2:31:07.040 --> 2:31:11.480
 to lead to mass manufacture in like May, 2020 is as absurd.

2:31:11.480 --> 2:31:14.800
 Anyway, so I was bothered by these solutions

2:31:14.800 --> 2:31:16.880
 not being explored and not by now

2:31:16.880 --> 2:31:19.400
 having really good Ivermectin studies.

2:31:19.400 --> 2:31:20.960
 So can I talk about Ivermectin?

2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:22.200
 Yeah, I would love that, yeah.

2:31:22.200 --> 2:31:25.640
 So full disclosure, my wife worked on Ivermectin at Merck

2:31:25.640 --> 2:31:28.520
 for 20 years, okay?

2:31:28.520 --> 2:31:30.960
 So they just want people to know,

2:31:30.960 --> 2:31:34.880
 but I don't talk to her all the time about it anyway.

2:31:34.880 --> 2:31:37.240
 She hasn't been at Merck for a long time.

2:31:37.240 --> 2:31:39.880
 As you know, Ivermectin is a very safe drug

2:31:39.880 --> 2:31:43.600
 used to treat certain parasitic infections, right?

2:31:43.600 --> 2:31:47.320
 And it is approved, it's amazing.

2:31:47.320 --> 2:31:48.680
 You can take one dose a year

2:31:48.680 --> 2:31:51.680
 and be protected against river blindness in Africa

2:31:51.680 --> 2:31:52.720
 and certain parts of Africa.

2:31:52.720 --> 2:31:54.680
 It's remarkably effective.

2:31:54.680 --> 2:31:59.680
 And so it's quite a safe drug at the doses that are approved.

2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:04.520
 Now, early last year, a study was done,

2:32:04.520 --> 2:32:07.400
 I believe in Australia, which showed in cells in the lab,

2:32:07.400 --> 2:32:11.160
 if you infect with SARS CoV2 and put Ivermectin in,

2:32:11.160 --> 2:32:13.880
 it would inhibit the virus production substantially.

2:32:13.880 --> 2:32:16.040
 It was quite clear, right?

2:32:16.040 --> 2:32:19.680
 But the concentrations they were using were rather high

2:32:19.680 --> 2:32:24.680
 and could not be achieved by the approved dosing.

2:32:25.400 --> 2:32:27.840
 So you would need to do a dosing study

2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:29.000
 to make sure it's safe.

2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:31.360
 And the reason is that Ivermectin binds

2:32:31.360 --> 2:32:34.320
 to receptors in your brain and it can have high doses.

2:32:34.320 --> 2:32:37.520
 A lot of, some people take high doses inappropriately

2:32:37.520 --> 2:32:39.640
 and they have neurological consequences.

2:32:39.640 --> 2:32:42.680
 So if you needed 10 times more Ivermectin,

2:32:42.680 --> 2:32:44.880
 you'd have to make sure it would be safe.

2:32:44.880 --> 2:32:46.440
 So this is a question of safety too.

2:32:46.440 --> 2:32:47.280
 Right.

2:32:47.280 --> 2:32:51.320
 So I think it has always been the case

2:32:51.320 --> 2:32:54.600
 that it should have been properly studied, but it wasn't.

2:32:54.600 --> 2:32:56.080
 There were lots of trials here and there,

2:32:56.080 --> 2:32:58.680
 lots of improperly controlled trials

2:32:58.680 --> 2:33:00.920
 where someone would just treat some patients and say,

2:33:00.920 --> 2:33:03.760
 hey, they all did fine, but have no control arm.

2:33:03.760 --> 2:33:05.240
 And there were some controlled trials,

2:33:05.240 --> 2:33:06.480
 but they were very small.

2:33:06.480 --> 2:33:11.480
 So right now, a 4,000 person trial is enrolling

2:33:11.480 --> 2:33:15.400
 to test in a randomly controlled trial setting,

2:33:15.400 --> 2:33:16.640
 whether it works or not.

2:33:16.640 --> 2:33:19.080
 There's still plenty of cases that you can do that.

2:33:19.080 --> 2:33:21.840
 So you can ask whether there are any side effects.

2:33:21.840 --> 2:33:23.880
 I think that's completely fine.

2:33:23.880 --> 2:33:27.400
 And if it says it works, then we should use it.

2:33:27.400 --> 2:33:30.080
 In the meantime, I always tell people,

2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:32.680
 if you want to use Ivermectin, you can do it off label.

2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:34.440
 It's FDA approved.

2:33:34.440 --> 2:33:35.560
 And if your physician says,

2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:37.520
 I'm going to give you this off label,

2:33:37.520 --> 2:33:40.680
 I don't have any objection.

2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:43.000
 But I don't know if it's going to work.

2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:48.000
 Now a friend of ours last week in New Jersey got COVID,

2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:49.840
 he went to his local hospital

2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:54.840
 and their regimen was Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, Ivermectin.

2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:58.600
 It's written, that's what they do for every COVID patient.

2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:00.440
 They just give it to them automatically.

2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:03.680
 And so he's, he recovered.

2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:07.720
 So who's to say it was or was not Ivermectin, right?

2:34:07.720 --> 2:34:12.200
 So I don't have any strong ideological opposition.

2:34:12.200 --> 2:34:14.000
 I just think it should be tested

2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.040
 for what you want to use it for.

2:34:16.040 --> 2:34:17.360
 And that's being done.

2:34:17.360 --> 2:34:18.600
 And I think that's fine.

2:34:18.600 --> 2:34:22.920
 Is it strange to you that Ivermectin

2:34:22.920 --> 2:34:25.640
 or other things like it weren't tested aggressively

2:34:25.640 --> 2:34:30.640
 in the beginning, from a broad scientific community aspect?

2:34:33.360 --> 2:34:35.440
 I can be a little bit conspiratorial.

2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:38.480
 And this is what people talk about with Ivermectin

2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:39.880
 is with the vaccines,

2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:42.160
 there's quite a lot of money to be made.

2:34:42.160 --> 2:34:45.160
 With Ivermectin, there's not as much money to be made.

2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:47.880
 Is that too conspiratorial?

2:34:47.880 --> 2:34:51.040
 Like why didn't we try more solutions in the beginning?

2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:55.120
 Well, all the money was put into vaccines, right?

2:34:55.120 --> 2:34:56.840
 Very little was put into antivirus

2:34:56.840 --> 2:34:59.040
 because the decision was made at a very high level,

2:34:59.040 --> 2:35:01.160
 probably involving Dr. Fauci.

2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:04.920
 We're going to put 24 billion into vaccines, right?

2:35:04.920 --> 2:35:08.000
 And I think part of the reasoning is

2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:10.080
 they give you years worth of protection,

2:35:10.080 --> 2:35:11.360
 whereas an antiviral works

2:35:11.360 --> 2:35:13.240
 and you have to keep dosing and so forth.

2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:16.000
 But Ivermectin is not trivial in this.

2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.600
 I agree it should have been tested early on,

2:35:18.600 --> 2:35:21.800
 but we had a really bad experience with hydroxychloroquine,

2:35:21.800 --> 2:35:23.800
 which we can talk about too.

2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:28.720
 Ivermectin is very hard to synthesize.

2:35:28.720 --> 2:35:31.560
 Most drugs you synthesize chemically.

2:35:31.560 --> 2:35:34.640
 You devise a formulation and a synthesis

2:35:34.640 --> 2:35:36.600
 and they do it, they scale it up and it's fine.

2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:38.280
 Ivermectin is really hard.

2:35:38.280 --> 2:35:40.120
 And so what they do instead

2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:43.800
 is they take the culture of the bacterium that makes it

2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:45.360
 and they grow it up and they ferment it

2:35:45.360 --> 2:35:47.160
 and then they purify it.

2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:50.080
 And Merck owns the bacteria.

2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:55.360
 A number of years ago, two employees of Merck stole it

2:35:55.360 --> 2:35:58.080
 and left the company and tried to mark it

2:35:58.080 --> 2:35:59.920
 and they were arrested and they got put in jail.

2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:02.720
 So they protected very carefully.

2:36:02.720 --> 2:36:05.840
 So you can't just make it.

2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:07.640
 If you do, it's incredibly expensive.

2:36:07.640 --> 2:36:10.120
 And now India, it's very cheap apparently.

2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:12.520
 They use it quite liberally there.

2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:14.400
 And I don't know how they're making it.

2:36:14.400 --> 2:36:16.600
 Maybe they've licensed it from Merck and so forth,

2:36:16.600 --> 2:36:21.600
 but that's why it hasn't been tested more widely, I think.

2:36:21.600 --> 2:36:24.080
 There's complexities in terms of getting a lot of it

2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:25.360
 and manufacturing a lot of it.

2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:26.360
 Yes. Okay.

2:36:26.360 --> 2:36:28.400
 So what was the other, the hydroxychloroquine?

2:36:28.400 --> 2:36:32.240
 So hydroxychloroquine was also shown early on

2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:34.360
 to inhibit virus in cell culture.

2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:37.320
 And that's not surprising.

2:36:37.320 --> 2:36:41.240
 Hydroxychloroquine of course is used for malaria

2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:46.240
 and what it does, when your cell takes up things

2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:49.600
 from the plasma membrane, including viruses,

2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:52.080
 it goes through a pathway called the endocytic pathway

2:36:52.080 --> 2:36:54.040
 which involves a vesicle moving through the cell.

2:36:54.040 --> 2:36:57.560
 And as it moves through the cell, it's pH drops.

2:36:57.560 --> 2:37:00.160
 And that lets a lot of viruses out actually

2:37:00.160 --> 2:37:01.800
 and hydroxychloroquine blocks that.

2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:04.160
 So it blocks infection with a lot of viruses.

2:37:06.360 --> 2:37:10.120
 So the problem with those early studies that were published

2:37:10.120 --> 2:37:14.120
 is that they were done in kidney cells and culture

2:37:14.120 --> 2:37:16.280
 where the only way the virus can get in

2:37:16.280 --> 2:37:17.520
 is through the endosome.

2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:20.920
 And hydroxychloroquine inhibits that

2:37:20.920 --> 2:37:24.400
 and that's why it inhibits in kidney cells and culture.

2:37:24.400 --> 2:37:28.040
 But lung cells and respiratory cells of humans

2:37:28.040 --> 2:37:31.560
 where the virus reproduces can get in two different ways.

2:37:31.560 --> 2:37:34.680
 It can get in from this endocytic pathway

2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:37.880
 which is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine

2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:40.320
 or it can get in at the cell surface

2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:43.120
 which is not inhibited by hydroxychloroquine.

2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:46.480
 So when you treat patients, it has no effect in the lung

2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:50.160
 because the virus can just bypass it.

2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:53.160
 And all the usage initially were based

2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:57.200
 on the studies done in kidney cells and culture.

2:37:57.200 --> 2:38:00.560
 So that was just wrong scientifically incorrect

2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:03.480
 yet it drove a lot of and today many people still think

2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:05.000
 they should be taking it but.

2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:09.240
 So like the that not panning out kind of resulted

2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:14.000
 in a loss of optimism about other similar things.

2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:16.440
 Well that and many other drugs repurposed drugs

2:38:16.440 --> 2:38:17.840
 were tried, right?

2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:20.240
 A lot of HIV antivirals were tried.

2:38:20.240 --> 2:38:23.520
 I think the problem with hydroxychloroquine

2:38:23.520 --> 2:38:26.080
 influenced the ivermectin narrative, right?

2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:29.360
 People thought that the data was being hidden

2:38:29.360 --> 2:38:30.600
 about hydroxychloroquine.

2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:32.360
 So they said, well they must be doing the same thing

2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:34.840
 with ivermectin but with hydroxychloroquine

2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:39.040
 it just scientifically could not work as an antiviral.

2:38:39.920 --> 2:38:42.120
 The other problem that is more broad

2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:44.000
 that is important to point out is that

2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:49.600
 when you have COVID and you need an antiviral

2:38:49.600 --> 2:38:50.920
 it's usually because you can't breathe

2:38:50.920 --> 2:38:52.960
 and you go in a hospital.

2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:54.760
 Because if you're mildly ill you're never gonna go

2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:56.800
 to your doctor and ask for an antiviral.

2:38:56.800 --> 2:38:58.400
 And the problem is when you can't breathe

2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:00.400
 it's no longer a viral issue.

2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:02.280
 It is now an inflammatory issue

2:39:02.280 --> 2:39:05.320
 and no antiviral in the world is gonna help you.

2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:09.040
 So if that's why remdesivir doesn't work very well

2:39:09.040 --> 2:39:10.560
 because it's mainly given intravenously

2:39:10.560 --> 2:39:12.320
 to people who go in a hospital.

2:39:13.160 --> 2:39:16.760
 If you get ivermectin in the hospital

2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:19.000
 it's not gonna do anything for reducing virus

2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:20.880
 because by that time you have very little virus

2:39:20.880 --> 2:39:21.840
 to begin with.

2:39:21.840 --> 2:39:23.200
 You have an inflammatory problem

2:39:23.200 --> 2:39:24.880
 that you need to treat in other ways.

2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:28.920
 So this is why a lot of the antivirals failed

2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:30.960
 because they're used too late.

2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:33.040
 What you need is a pill you take

2:39:33.040 --> 2:39:36.880
 on that first positive test when you have a scratchy throat.

2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:41.400
 You get a PCR in 15 minutes on positive take a pill, boom.

2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:42.800
 That's gonna inhibit it.

2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:44.960
 If you wait till you can't breathe

2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:47.280
 and that's why the monoclonals even don't work

2:39:47.280 --> 2:39:49.200
 if you're in a hospital that well.

2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:52.880
 Cause it's too late and the approach now is

2:39:52.880 --> 2:39:54.440
 if you're in a high risk group

2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:57.920
 if you're over 65, if you are obese

2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:00.760
 or have diabetes or any other comorbidities

2:40:00.760 --> 2:40:03.840
 your first sign of a scratchy throat positive

2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:06.000
 you get monoclonals.

2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:07.360
 Then they might help you

2:40:07.360 --> 2:40:09.200
 but if you wait till you go in a hospital

2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:12.080
 it's too late cause the viral curve drops

2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:15.560
 after that first symptom within three days

2:40:15.560 --> 2:40:18.520
 you're no longer shedding enough virus to transmit.

2:40:19.640 --> 2:40:20.760
 Drops really quickly.

2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:23.240
 So that's the reason a lot of these antivirals failed

2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:25.920
 cause they were tested in hospitalized patients

2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:29.560
 and we have nothing but remdesivir now unfortunately.

2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:31.000
 So it was the wrong approach.

2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.840
 We should have been giving it to people

2:40:33.840 --> 2:40:35.880
 who just tested positive from the start.

2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:38.200
 Or even for preventative and see.

2:40:38.200 --> 2:40:39.720
 You could do that too.

2:40:39.720 --> 2:40:42.080
 But I have to say the other issue is

2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:45.080
 this molnupiravir is a drug in phase three now

2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:48.480
 it's an oral antiviral that looks good.

2:40:48.480 --> 2:40:51.200
 If we go ahead with just one

2:40:51.200 --> 2:40:53.360
 we're gonna get resistance within a few months

2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:54.400
 and it will be useless.

2:40:54.400 --> 2:40:56.880
 We need to have at least two or three drugs

2:40:56.880 --> 2:40:58.880
 that we can give in combinations.

2:40:58.880 --> 2:41:01.720
 And we know that cause that's what took care of HIV

2:41:01.720 --> 2:41:05.320
 that's what took care of HCV, hepatitis C virus.

2:41:05.320 --> 2:41:08.160
 It really reduces the emergence of resistance.

2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:11.640
 Joe Rogan got quite a bit of heat recently

2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:16.640
 about mentioning a paper and a broader idea

2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:19.960
 which I didn't, I don't think is that controversial

2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:21.760
 but maybe we can expand on it.

2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:27.840
 And the idea is that vaccines create selective pressure

2:41:29.520 --> 2:41:34.360
 for a virus to mutate and for variants to form.

2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:40.400
 First of all, from a biological perspective

2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:42.120
 can you explain this process?

2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:45.720
 And from a societal perspective

2:41:45.720 --> 2:41:47.640
 what are we supposed to do about that?

2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:49.600
 So let's get the terminology right.

2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:51.880
 So as we talked about earlier

2:41:51.880 --> 2:41:54.120
 viruses are always mutating.

2:41:54.120 --> 2:41:58.400
 So no vaccine or no drug makes a virus mutate.

2:41:58.400 --> 2:41:59.560
 That's the wrong perspective

2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:00.680
 which you look at it.

2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:05.000
 What the immune response is putting pressure

2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:07.080
 selection pressure on the virus.

2:42:07.080 --> 2:42:11.560
 And if there's a one particle with the right mutation

2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:15.320
 that can escape the antibody that will emerge, right?

2:42:15.320 --> 2:42:17.760
 So that's what happens with influenza virus, right?

2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:20.280
 We vaccinate every year

2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:22.200
 and there are not a lot of people that get infected

2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:23.920
 so they get natural immunity.

2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:28.920
 And then the virus is incredibly varied.

2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:30.280
 It mutates like crazy.

2:42:30.280 --> 2:42:32.160
 And there's in some person somewhere

2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:34.440
 there's one variant that escapes the antibody

2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:37.160
 which has been induced either by infection or vaccination.

2:42:37.160 --> 2:42:38.000
 It can be both.

2:42:38.920 --> 2:42:41.360
 And that drives the emergence of the new variants

2:42:41.360 --> 2:42:43.920
 so the next year we need to change the vaccine.

2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:48.920
 So I would say both natural infection and vaccination

2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.480
 sure select for variants.

2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:53.520
 Absolutely, there's no question

2:42:53.520 --> 2:42:55.440
 because they're inducing immunity.

2:42:55.440 --> 2:43:00.040
 Now what happened last year was at the beginning of 2020

2:43:00.040 --> 2:43:02.320
 very few people in the world were immune

2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:04.920
 as the virus first started spreading.

2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:09.160
 But you can see in the sequences of those isolates

2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:11.040
 from the beginning of 2020,

2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:14.680
 you can see all of the changes that are now present

2:43:14.680 --> 2:43:17.720
 in the variants of concern at very, very low frequencies.

2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:18.680
 They were already there

2:43:18.680 --> 2:43:21.960
 but there was no selection for them to emerge.

2:43:21.960 --> 2:43:25.360
 Until November when we now had many millions of people

2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:29.800
 who had mostly been infected but also some vaccinated

2:43:29.800 --> 2:43:33.080
 then we saw the alpha variant emerge in England

2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:35.360
 probably because of immune selection.

2:43:35.360 --> 2:43:40.360
 Now the virus that had the change that evaded the antibody

2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:41.960
 had an advantage

2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:44.040
 and that virus drove through the population.

2:43:44.040 --> 2:43:45.280
 So that's what we're seeing.

2:43:45.280 --> 2:43:47.960
 All these variants are simply antigenic selection.

2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:52.720
 So the variants, the mutations that are at the core

2:43:52.720 --> 2:43:55.440
 of these quote unquote variants,

2:43:55.440 --> 2:43:58.320
 they were always there all along the vaccine

2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:00.400
 or the infections did not create them.

2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:02.640
 No, the infections don't create them, they're selected.

2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:07.640
 It's like the vaccine wipe out a lot of the variants

2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:12.640
 and then by making your body immune to them

2:44:13.360 --> 2:44:15.520
 but some of them survive.

2:44:15.520 --> 2:44:16.840
 Yeah, exactly.

2:44:16.840 --> 2:44:19.520
 And then there's another tree that's built

2:44:19.520 --> 2:44:22.560
 and it's unclear what that tree leads to.

2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:26.960
 I mean, it could make things much worse or much better

2:44:26.960 --> 2:44:28.360
 and we don't know.

2:44:28.360 --> 2:44:31.240
 Well with flu, we see year after year, the virus changes,

2:44:31.240 --> 2:44:33.560
 we change the vaccine, we deal with it,

2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:35.520
 we change it again, there's an unending series.

2:44:35.520 --> 2:44:37.280
 But see, that's a very different story.

2:44:37.280 --> 2:44:42.280
 If do you think COVID will be with some likelihood

2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:47.880
 like the flu, whereas basically variants

2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:52.800
 will never be able to eradicate it.

2:44:52.800 --> 2:44:57.400
 It will never eradicate it in any case, ever.

2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:01.760
 Well, come up with a vaccine that makes you immune

2:45:01.760 --> 2:45:04.640
 to enough variants where there's not enough

2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:07.280
 evolutionary like room.

2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:09.160
 Well, if you cut down the number of infections,

2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:12.240
 then you reduce the diversity, sure, right?

2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:15.200
 The problem is if, let's say you're a cynic

2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:18.160
 and you say, well, vaccination is just selecting

2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:20.080
 for variants, so let's stop it.

2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:21.520
 But then you're gonna have infection

2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:23.320
 and that's gonna select for variants

2:45:23.320 --> 2:45:26.280
 and there, you're more likely to get very sick

2:45:26.280 --> 2:45:28.680
 because we know the vaccines are really good

2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:30.120
 at preventing you from dying.

2:45:30.120 --> 2:45:34.120
 So that's why it still makes sense to use vaccines

2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:36.920
 because they prevent you from dying.

2:45:36.920 --> 2:45:38.240
 That's the bottom line.

2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:43.240
 But can we ever make a vaccine that deals with all variants?

2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:45.640
 Absolutely.

2:45:45.640 --> 2:45:49.280
 And the reason I say that is because people

2:45:49.280 --> 2:45:53.400
 who get naturally infected with SARS COVID,

2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:55.160
 they develop COVID, they recover.

2:45:56.920 --> 2:45:59.600
 If you give them one vaccine dose,

2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:02.920
 they make an immune response that handles

2:46:02.920 --> 2:46:05.800
 all the variants that are around right now.

2:46:05.800 --> 2:46:07.800
 All of them, much better than people

2:46:07.800 --> 2:46:10.440
 who've gotten two doses of vaccine.

2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:12.880
 For some reason, their immune response

2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:16.920
 is suddenly broadened after the infection vaccination

2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:18.560
 and they can handle all the variants

2:46:18.560 --> 2:46:19.400
 that we know of so far.

2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:22.840
 So that tells me we can devise a strategy

2:46:22.840 --> 2:46:24.600
 to do the same thing with a vaccine

2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:26.680
 that makes a really broad vaccine

2:46:26.680 --> 2:46:28.080
 that'll handle all the variants.

2:46:28.080 --> 2:46:30.720
 Well, you actually, on the virology blog,

2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:32.120
 I don't know if you're the author of that,

2:46:32.120 --> 2:46:36.840
 but the blog, yes, but there's a particular post

2:46:36.840 --> 2:46:39.440
 that's talking about reporting on a paper

2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:40.880
 that makes a match strategy.

2:46:40.880 --> 2:46:44.200
 Oh yes, that's one of my co writers, Trudy Ray.

2:46:44.200 --> 2:46:46.640
 Yeah, that's an interesting idea

2:46:46.640 --> 2:46:49.400
 that there are some early evidence now

2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:52.480
 that mixing and matching vaccines,

2:46:52.480 --> 2:46:56.560
 like one shot of Pfizer and one of Moderna or something,

2:46:56.560 --> 2:47:00.520
 that creates a much better immunity

2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:02.840
 than does two shots of Pfizer.

2:47:02.840 --> 2:47:05.400
 I think that's worth exploring, absolutely.

2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:09.120
 And this is relevant, what we're doing with influenza,

2:47:09.120 --> 2:47:11.240
 you know, instead of having to vaccinate people every year,

2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:12.840
 why can't we devise a vaccine

2:47:12.840 --> 2:47:14.800
 which you'd get once in your lifetime

2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:17.400
 or maybe once every 10 years, okay?

2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:22.400
 So the spike of influenza, it's a long protein,

2:47:22.440 --> 2:47:24.720
 kind of like the spike of SARS CoV2,

2:47:24.720 --> 2:47:26.320
 it's stuck in the virus membrane.

2:47:26.320 --> 2:47:31.320
 And the very tip, that's the part that changes every year.

2:47:31.360 --> 2:47:33.720
 This is where the antibodies bind.

2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:36.480
 But the stem doesn't change.

2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:39.880
 And if you make antibodies to the stem,

2:47:39.880 --> 2:47:41.680
 they can also prevent infection.

2:47:41.680 --> 2:47:44.040
 It's just that when people are infected

2:47:44.040 --> 2:47:45.960
 or with the current vaccines,

2:47:45.960 --> 2:47:48.840
 they don't make many antibodies to that stem part.

2:47:48.840 --> 2:47:51.400
 But we're trying to figure out how to make those

2:47:51.400 --> 2:47:53.600
 and we think they would be broadly protective

2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:57.840
 and you'd never be able to or more rarely be able to

2:47:57.840 --> 2:48:00.920
 have a variant emerge that escaped it.

2:48:00.920 --> 2:48:04.800
 And I think we can do the same thing with coronavirus too,

2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:05.640
 for sure.

2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:08.360
 Can I ask you about testing?

2:48:08.360 --> 2:48:10.160
 Sure, sure.

2:48:10.160 --> 2:48:13.320
 So you mentioned PCR, what kind of tests are there?

2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:18.160
 The antigen test, what are your thoughts on each?

2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:22.480
 Maybe this is a good place to also mention like viral load.

2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:27.480
 And the history of the virus as it passes through your body

2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:31.200
 in terms of what's being tested for

2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:33.320
 and all those kinds of things.

2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:38.320
 So the first tests that were developed were PCR,

2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:40.200
 polymerase chain reaction.

2:48:40.200 --> 2:48:43.720
 They're basically nucleic acid amplification tests.

2:48:43.720 --> 2:48:44.720
 And they were very first ones.

2:48:44.720 --> 2:48:47.920
 They stuck the swab all the way up into your brain almost.

2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:50.800
 I had that done a couple of weeks ago.

2:48:50.800 --> 2:48:53.400
 Oh my gosh, it's really nasty.

2:48:53.400 --> 2:48:56.240
 But now they do an interior nary swab.

2:48:56.240 --> 2:48:59.640
 They get a bunch of cells and some mucus

2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:04.280
 which has virus and parts of virus sticking in a test tube

2:49:04.280 --> 2:49:05.960
 and then they run a reaction,

2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:09.000
 which by the way involves reverse transcriptase

2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:11.960
 because it converts the viral RNA to DNA

2:49:11.960 --> 2:49:14.200
 and then you amplify it.

2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:18.920
 And you can specify what part of the viral RNA

2:49:18.920 --> 2:49:20.240
 you wanna amplify.

2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:22.480
 And then a machine will detect it

2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:25.080
 and it can be done in 15 minutes.

2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:29.080
 But you're detecting pieces of RNA, not infectious virus.

2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:32.400
 So we're measuring viral RNA loads, right?

2:49:32.400 --> 2:49:37.120
 And a common mistake that many people who should know better

2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:40.080
 physicians and scientists of all kinds,

2:49:40.080 --> 2:49:42.600
 they think that indicates how much virus you have.

2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:44.440
 It doesn't.

2:49:45.520 --> 2:49:48.600
 It's a diagnostic of whether you have bits of RNA in you.

2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:51.280
 And it probably means you're infected,

2:49:51.280 --> 2:49:55.400
 but you can't use it to shed light on what's going on.

2:49:55.400 --> 2:49:56.840
 And I'll tell you why in a bit,

2:49:56.840 --> 2:49:59.440
 but first we have to explain some other things.

2:50:01.920 --> 2:50:06.360
 So until you get to about a million copies of RNA,

2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:08.520
 so you can measure the copy number in this test,

2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:09.640
 this PCR test.

2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:13.800
 It's a number called CT or cycle threshold.

2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:16.360
 The test, the way the machine works, it goes through cycles

2:50:16.360 --> 2:50:19.920
 and every cycle it amplifies what you put in.

2:50:19.920 --> 2:50:23.880
 And the more cycles you need to see something,

2:50:23.880 --> 2:50:26.640
 that means there's not a lot of RNA there.

2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:31.120
 So if you do a test and you have a cycle threshold of 35,

2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:33.640
 you have very little RNA in you.

2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:36.160
 Contrary, if you have a cycle threshold of 10,

2:50:36.160 --> 2:50:38.680
 you have a ton of RNA and you only took 10 cycles

2:50:38.680 --> 2:50:39.520
 to detect it.

2:50:40.680 --> 2:50:42.800
 And you can extrapolate from that number,

2:50:42.800 --> 2:50:46.080
 the number of copies you have per sample, say per swab.

2:50:46.080 --> 2:50:49.160
 And if you don't have a million, you're not infectious.

2:50:49.160 --> 2:50:50.800
 You're not gonna infect anyone.

2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:54.720
 So in the early days, no matter what PCR result you had,

2:50:54.720 --> 2:50:56.040
 they would quarantine you.

2:50:56.040 --> 2:50:58.360
 And that was wrong because you're not shedding,

2:50:58.360 --> 2:51:00.040
 you don't need to be quarantined,

2:51:00.040 --> 2:51:02.760
 but wasn't thought through properly, right?

2:51:02.760 --> 2:51:05.440
 That's where you had like 14 days or something like that.

2:51:05.440 --> 2:51:07.960
 14 days, which is now we know is too long

2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:11.600
 because you don't shed for that long in a normal infection.

2:51:11.600 --> 2:51:14.160
 Now it's 10 days should be fine.

2:51:14.160 --> 2:51:16.200
 So what happens is you get infected,

2:51:16.200 --> 2:51:17.840
 you don't know it, of course,

2:51:17.840 --> 2:51:19.800
 the virus starts to grow very quickly.

2:51:19.800 --> 2:51:21.960
 And within four or five days,

2:51:21.960 --> 2:51:24.720
 you reach a peak of shedding,

2:51:24.720 --> 2:51:26.680
 you're making a lot of RNA

2:51:26.680 --> 2:51:28.280
 and you may be asymptomatic,

2:51:28.280 --> 2:51:30.080
 you're shedding, you can infect others,

2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:32.840
 and then you may or may not have your symptom onset.

2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:36.280
 So you shed for a couple of days before symptom onset

2:51:36.280 --> 2:51:38.640
 and then within three days, four days,

2:51:38.640 --> 2:51:41.480
 the viral RNA crashes and you're no longer shedding,

2:51:41.480 --> 2:51:42.960
 you're no longer transmitting.

2:51:42.960 --> 2:51:44.560
 So that's the one kind of test we have.

2:51:44.560 --> 2:51:47.680
 It can tell you if you're infected at the moment,

2:51:47.680 --> 2:51:49.080
 but it won't tell you

2:51:49.080 --> 2:51:51.520
 if you're gonna be infected tomorrow, right?

2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:52.680
 Because if you're negative today,

2:51:52.680 --> 2:51:54.040
 you could be positive tomorrow.

2:51:54.040 --> 2:51:56.200
 You just might be in a different part

2:51:56.200 --> 2:51:58.320
 of the incubation period, right?

2:51:58.320 --> 2:52:01.120
 So that's one test been used the most.

2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:05.040
 You can now get 15 minute versions of them

2:52:05.040 --> 2:52:06.880
 in a walk in or whatever, fine.

2:52:06.880 --> 2:52:08.080
 Then there are antigen tests,

2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:11.640
 which look for the proteins that the virus is making.

2:52:11.640 --> 2:52:13.480
 So as it's reproducing in your nose,

2:52:13.480 --> 2:52:16.160
 it's not only making genomes, it's making proteins.

2:52:16.160 --> 2:52:18.400
 And so these you can buy in the drugstore.

2:52:18.400 --> 2:52:22.160
 And these would have been great if they had,

2:52:22.160 --> 2:52:24.360
 Michael Minna last year had the idea

2:52:24.360 --> 2:52:26.520
 that if we could make a little stick,

2:52:26.520 --> 2:52:28.640
 a little piece of paper that you would suck on

2:52:28.640 --> 2:52:30.400
 and it would tell you if you're infected or not,

2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:32.600
 if this could cost less than a buck,

2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:34.160
 everybody could test themselves.

2:52:34.160 --> 2:52:37.080
 Which they can cost less than a buck, by the way.

2:52:37.080 --> 2:52:38.880
 Yeah, but they were never made, right?

2:52:38.880 --> 2:52:42.320
 Yeah, they're never mass manufactured.

2:52:42.320 --> 2:52:44.840
 So his idea is to do like daily tests.

2:52:44.840 --> 2:52:45.680
 So there are some.

2:52:45.680 --> 2:52:47.360
 Yeah, daily and then the kid's going to school,

2:52:47.360 --> 2:52:49.880
 he's positive or she's positive.

2:52:49.880 --> 2:52:51.840
 Well, if it's cheap enough, you just take another test

2:52:51.840 --> 2:52:53.560
 because they have a certain error frequency.

2:52:53.560 --> 2:52:55.320
 If it's positive twice, you stay home

2:52:55.320 --> 2:52:57.200
 and the next day you try again.

2:52:57.200 --> 2:52:59.880
 And I think this would have revolutionized

2:52:59.880 --> 2:53:02.480
 because the PCR tests are more expensive at the time

2:53:02.480 --> 2:53:05.320
 and they take longer to do and so forth.

2:53:05.320 --> 2:53:07.040
 But that never happened.

2:53:07.040 --> 2:53:10.040
 But now we do have $20 binax now and others

2:53:10.040 --> 2:53:12.240
 that you can buy and people buy them and...

2:53:12.240 --> 2:53:14.000
 See, but that can still happen, right?

2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:16.040
 And this is the very frustrating thing to me

2:53:16.040 --> 2:53:19.000
 because I'm worried about variants,

2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:20.680
 but I'm also worried about future

2:53:20.680 --> 2:53:22.800
 and much more deadly pandemics.

2:53:24.800 --> 2:53:28.480
 I know we kind of said, yes, COVID and lots of deaths,

2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:31.000
 but like it could be a lot worse too.

2:53:31.920 --> 2:53:35.000
 So I'm thinking what is going to be

2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:38.560
 the right response for the future pandemic of its kind?

2:53:38.560 --> 2:53:41.600
 And what's the right response for continued number of variants

2:53:41.600 --> 2:53:44.560
 and some of the variants might be deadlier

2:53:44.560 --> 2:53:45.920
 or more transmissible?

2:53:45.920 --> 2:53:50.920
 Well, the antigen tests will pick up the variants.

2:53:51.840 --> 2:53:52.680
 That's not a question.

2:53:52.680 --> 2:53:55.080
 The PCR may be influenced by changes,

2:53:55.080 --> 2:53:58.440
 but you can quickly adapt the primers that you use.

2:53:58.440 --> 2:53:59.720
 But that's what I mean, like to me,

2:53:59.720 --> 2:54:03.280
 all these discussions about vaccines and so on.

2:54:03.280 --> 2:54:06.800
 Vaccines, we got very lucky that they took so little time.

2:54:06.800 --> 2:54:08.040
 Right.

2:54:08.040 --> 2:54:10.480
 And you have to be aware, no matter what,

2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:13.280
 that there's hesitancy with the vaccines in this country.

2:54:13.280 --> 2:54:15.640
 Before, I mean, yeah, that's a reality.

2:54:15.640 --> 2:54:17.520
 You can't just be like magically saying

2:54:17.520 --> 2:54:20.400
 that you're going to overcome that.

2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:22.160
 And I don't think there's any hesitancy

2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:24.000
 and cheap tests at home.

2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:26.320
 I agree, I think if someone...

2:54:26.320 --> 2:54:28.240
 So the question is, if someone tested positive,

2:54:28.240 --> 2:54:29.200
 would they stay home?

2:54:29.200 --> 2:54:30.040
 That's the question.

2:54:30.040 --> 2:54:32.320
 What if their job depends on them going in?

2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:33.560
 I mean, that's...

2:54:33.560 --> 2:54:36.600
 Well, you have to look at sort of aggregate,

2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:38.120
 how many people would decide.

2:54:38.120 --> 2:54:43.000
 And I think, again, a lot of that is in leadership,

2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:44.960
 but I think a lot of them,

2:54:44.960 --> 2:54:47.120
 I would say most people would stay home.

2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:49.400
 I think that Mina had the idea

2:54:49.400 --> 2:54:53.120
 and it would have changed the whole situation for sure.

2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:56.160
 If it could have been made when we talked to him last spring,

2:54:56.160 --> 2:54:59.840
 I think, or summer, we would have gotten around

2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:01.480
 a lot of the issues that we're in today

2:55:01.480 --> 2:55:03.000
 because I think people would have stayed home

2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:03.960
 and not transmitted.

2:55:03.960 --> 2:55:06.000
 And I think it's still valuable to this day.

2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:09.760
 In the fall, if we don't have vaccine uptake,

2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:13.400
 we could just test kids every day and keep them home

2:55:13.400 --> 2:55:14.240
 when they're infected.

2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:17.560
 And we don't have it.

2:55:17.560 --> 2:55:20.560
 But I think, and I'm not privy to what was going on,

2:55:20.560 --> 2:55:22.920
 but I don't think a lot of emphasis

2:55:22.920 --> 2:55:25.040
 was put on testing early on.

2:55:25.040 --> 2:55:27.880
 The CDC developed the first one, it was flawed.

2:55:27.880 --> 2:55:29.320
 They had to recall the kids.

2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:30.320
 I mean, there's a fiasco.

2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:32.200
 They should have had 100 companies

2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:34.680
 making the tests initially, right?

2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:37.920
 So for the future, I think what we have learned

2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:40.360
 is we need to have a rapid antigen test

2:55:40.360 --> 2:55:43.640
 right off the bat that's doable.

2:55:43.640 --> 2:55:46.200
 You can't do it in a day like you can for PCR

2:55:46.200 --> 2:55:49.680
 because you need to make antibodies

2:55:49.680 --> 2:55:51.120
 to the protein that you're looking for

2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:52.880
 and you need to do those in animals,

2:55:52.880 --> 2:55:54.640
 but you can do it in weeks

2:55:55.560 --> 2:55:57.640
 and we should be ready for that.

2:55:57.640 --> 2:56:00.640
 Yeah, because I mean, to me, that's obvious.

2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:02.800
 That's obviously the best solution.

2:56:02.800 --> 2:56:06.840
 Second to that, if we understood how well masks work.

2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:11.280
 Like maybe let me ask you this question.

2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:13.020
 Let's put masks aside.

2:56:14.040 --> 2:56:18.080
 How will do we understand how COVID is transmitted?

2:56:18.080 --> 2:56:23.080
 There's droplets of different sizes, aerosols,

2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:24.800
 tiny, tiny droplets.

2:56:24.800 --> 2:56:28.480
 It seems like that's a very difficult thing

2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:29.840
 to understand thoroughly.

2:56:30.840 --> 2:56:34.200
 So it seems like it's transmitted both ways.

2:56:34.200 --> 2:56:36.520
 It's unclear how exactly.

2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:39.440
 So how much do we understand

2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:41.440
 and why is it so difficult to understand fully?

2:56:41.440 --> 2:56:43.960
 I think it's clear that it's transmitted

2:56:43.960 --> 2:56:45.640
 through the air mostly.

2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:47.120
 It's not touching.

2:56:47.120 --> 2:56:48.760
 We thought initially it would be a lot of touch,

2:56:48.760 --> 2:56:50.920
 but very little of that.

2:56:50.920 --> 2:56:53.920
 It's through the air and when you talk,

2:56:53.920 --> 2:56:57.400
 mainly when you talk, you expel a lot of droplets, right?

2:56:57.400 --> 2:57:00.200
 Even the plosives that your foam thing here

2:57:00.200 --> 2:57:02.280
 are meant to pee, right?

2:57:02.280 --> 2:57:03.800
 That you send out little sprays

2:57:03.800 --> 2:57:06.200
 and those have viruses in them.

2:57:06.200 --> 2:57:07.960
 And the big drops fall to the ground

2:57:08.880 --> 2:57:11.960
 and the little ones can go 100 feet or more, right?

2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:14.640
 But the little ones also have less virus in them.

2:57:16.400 --> 2:57:19.400
 So I'm not sure, well, we certainly do not know

2:57:19.400 --> 2:57:22.000
 how much virus you need to be infected,

2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:25.600
 but it's probably at least several thousand particles,

2:57:25.600 --> 2:57:26.720
 if not more.

2:57:26.720 --> 2:57:30.080
 And it could be that for most people,

2:57:30.960 --> 2:57:33.320
 the tiny droplets don't have enough virus

2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:34.840
 to infect someone else.

2:57:34.840 --> 2:57:37.720
 But there's one observation about this virus

2:57:37.720 --> 2:57:39.280
 that's really interesting.

2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:42.680
 And that is that 80% of transmissions

2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:47.000
 are done by 20% of the people, of the infected people.

2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:50.440
 Not every infected person transmits.

2:57:50.440 --> 2:57:52.520
 That's been borne out in multiple studies.

2:57:52.520 --> 2:57:56.360
 And in fact, there's a study at University of Colorado

2:57:56.360 --> 2:57:59.280
 where they quantified the viral RNA loads

2:57:59.280 --> 2:58:01.880
 and all the swabs that had been done of students

2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:03.480
 for like a six month period.

2:58:04.320 --> 2:58:08.440
 And most of the infectious virus,

2:58:08.440 --> 2:58:11.640
 most of the RNA copies were found in

2:58:12.880 --> 2:58:15.160
 15 to 20% of the people.

2:58:15.160 --> 2:58:17.480
 The rest had really low and that's probably

2:58:17.480 --> 2:58:18.880
 why they don't transmit.

2:58:18.880 --> 2:58:22.880
 So those are the ones that might get enough virus

2:58:22.880 --> 2:58:25.760
 in the tiny droplets to be able to infect someone

2:58:25.760 --> 2:58:27.000
 at a distance.

2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:29.320
 And I think that's entirely possible.

2:58:29.320 --> 2:58:31.520
 Why is it hard to study?

2:58:31.520 --> 2:58:33.280
 You can't do it in real life

2:58:33.280 --> 2:58:35.840
 because you don't know who's infected.

2:58:35.840 --> 2:58:38.280
 And if you do, there's not a controlled environment

2:58:38.280 --> 2:58:39.720
 to measure droplets and so forth.

2:58:39.720 --> 2:58:42.760
 You'd have to do it in a laboratory situation.

2:58:42.760 --> 2:58:44.600
 If you use an animal, you just don't know

2:58:44.600 --> 2:58:47.000
 what the relevance of that is to people.

2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:50.520
 You'd have to use human and do challenge experiments

2:58:50.520 --> 2:58:52.400
 and we don't do that at this point,

2:58:52.400 --> 2:58:53.800
 at least not for this virus.

2:58:53.800 --> 2:58:55.960
 So that's why it's hard to know what's going on.

2:58:55.960 --> 2:58:58.280
 So we have to make inferences

2:58:58.280 --> 2:59:01.280
 from epidemiological associations

2:59:01.280 --> 2:59:03.880
 where you're studying say transmission in a household

2:59:03.880 --> 2:59:06.120
 where people are stuck in the same rooms together

2:59:06.120 --> 2:59:09.200
 and you can get an idea of what kind of droplets

2:59:09.200 --> 2:59:10.040
 we're involved in.

2:59:10.040 --> 2:59:12.600
 So that makes it much harder to if you're leaning

2:59:12.600 --> 2:59:15.680
 on epidemiological stuff as opposed to like biophysics

2:59:15.680 --> 2:59:17.320
 or something like the mechanic.

2:59:17.320 --> 2:59:18.360
 Very hard.

2:59:18.360 --> 2:59:23.160
 So that makes it really hard to then develop solutions

2:59:23.160 --> 2:59:26.600
 like masks to ask the question, how will the masks work?

2:59:26.600 --> 2:59:28.800
 Because then to answer that question,

2:59:28.800 --> 2:59:32.280
 you can lean on epidemiological stuff again,

2:59:32.280 --> 2:59:34.560
 like looking at populations that wear masks

2:59:34.560 --> 2:59:36.600
 or just don't wear masks.

2:59:36.600 --> 2:59:38.840
 As opposed to actually saying,

2:59:40.320 --> 2:59:41.880
 like from an engineering perspective,

2:59:41.880 --> 2:59:46.600
 like what kind of material and what kind of tightness

2:59:46.600 --> 2:59:50.440
 by which amount decreases the viral load

2:59:50.440 --> 2:59:52.520
 that's received on the other end.

2:59:52.520 --> 2:59:55.840
 But some experiments have been done with masks

2:59:55.840 --> 2:59:58.600
 and just droplets with no virus in them, right?

2:59:58.600 --> 3:00:01.400
 And you can measure the efficiency

3:00:01.400 --> 3:00:04.400
 of different mask materials at keeping those in.

3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:09.400
 So if I say that this mask stops 70% of this

3:00:09.400 --> 3:00:13.040
 or larger size droplet,

3:00:13.840 --> 3:00:18.080
 that leads to this percent decreased transmission.

3:00:19.240 --> 3:00:23.120
 And also on both the generation

3:00:23.120 --> 3:00:27.680
 and the receiving end and the giving end.

3:00:27.680 --> 3:00:30.600
 So how will the mask protect you from others?

3:00:30.600 --> 3:00:34.280
 How well do you do mask protect others from you?

3:00:34.280 --> 3:00:37.000
 Like all of those things seem like

3:00:37.000 --> 3:00:40.160
 they could be more rigorously studied.

3:00:40.160 --> 3:00:41.600
 There's no doubt about it.

3:00:41.600 --> 3:00:46.120
 And now is the time because once this is over,

3:00:46.120 --> 3:00:47.240
 nobody's gonna do it.

3:00:47.240 --> 3:00:49.160
 Nobody's gonna care, right?

3:00:49.160 --> 3:00:52.920
 But it seems like to me, so tests is one thing,

3:00:52.920 --> 3:00:57.520
 but masks, like the good mask,

3:00:57.520 --> 3:00:59.960
 whatever the good means, whatever that means,

3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:04.240
 like some level of quality of material on your face,

3:01:04.240 --> 3:01:07.560
 if it's shown to actually like thoroughly shown

3:01:07.560 --> 3:01:10.960
 to work well, that seems like an obvious solution

3:01:12.160 --> 3:01:14.880
 to reopen society with,

3:01:14.880 --> 3:01:17.960
 if you have a good understanding of how well they work.

3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:20.080
 Because if you don't have a good understanding,

3:01:20.080 --> 3:01:23.040
 if there's a lot of uncertainty, that's when you get,

3:01:23.040 --> 3:01:25.000
 and you have people speaking from authority,

3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:28.000
 that's when you start getting the politicization

3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:28.840
 of the solution.

3:01:28.840 --> 3:01:29.680
 Of course, of course.

3:01:29.680 --> 3:01:32.200
 No, the data, there are some data.

3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:36.360
 Most, they're mostly epidemiological

3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:39.160
 and they show some effect in some countries, right?

3:01:39.160 --> 3:01:40.760
 But they could be way better.

3:01:40.760 --> 3:01:41.600
 Yeah.

3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:44.920
 And, but the fact that they're not perfect,

3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:46.800
 then people take advantage of and say,

3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:48.120
 well, look, they don't work that well,

3:01:48.120 --> 3:01:49.120
 so I'm not gonna wear it.

3:01:49.120 --> 3:01:53.040
 I think, as you said, people can use it as an excuse.

3:01:53.040 --> 3:01:56.200
 But even if it works, so Daniel always says it,

3:01:56.200 --> 3:02:00.680
 a mask will cut down transmission by 50 to 60%.

3:02:00.680 --> 3:02:03.520
 And then distance will do another 30%.

3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:05.840
 Yeah, those numbers are made up though.

3:02:05.840 --> 3:02:08.400
 I mean, they're not made up, but they're estimates.

3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:09.240
 Absolutely.

3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:13.240
 And many of them are made based on models, right?

3:02:13.240 --> 3:02:15.600
 We will make this model and let's say the mask

3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:18.040
 cuts down this much, what will be the effect on,

3:02:18.040 --> 3:02:19.120
 I mean, yeah, they're models.

3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:20.880
 And it's for the same reason,

3:02:20.880 --> 3:02:25.080
 I don't believe the transmission of the variants

3:02:25.080 --> 3:02:27.360
 because it's all based on statistical models as well,

3:02:27.360 --> 3:02:29.640
 not biological experiments done in the lab.

3:02:29.640 --> 3:02:31.480
 So that in that sense, vaccine date

3:02:31.480 --> 3:02:33.320
 is much better than mask date.

3:02:33.320 --> 3:02:34.560
 For sure, for sure.

3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:37.240
 So my problem with the mask date,

3:02:37.240 --> 3:02:38.560
 which I always thought was fascinating,

3:02:38.560 --> 3:02:39.720
 I stopped talking about it.

3:02:39.720 --> 3:02:41.480
 I was in the paper about masks.

3:02:41.480 --> 3:02:45.160
 I stopped talking about it because what started happening

3:02:45.160 --> 3:02:48.080
 is mask created assholes on both sides.

3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:50.480
 The people that were like in Silicon Valley,

3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:52.600
 the friends of mine that were wearing masks,

3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:56.280
 the way they look at others who don't is like.

3:02:56.280 --> 3:02:58.320
 Well, that's a whole nother issue, right?

3:02:58.320 --> 3:02:59.920
 Yeah, I understand.

3:02:59.920 --> 3:03:02.600
 That happens when you don't have solid science.

3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:03.440
 Understood.

3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:07.280
 They now start judging you like you're a lesser human being.

3:03:07.280 --> 3:03:11.560
 You're not only dumb, but you're almost like evil.

3:03:11.560 --> 3:03:14.320
 You're doing bad for society by not wearing a mask.

3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:17.120
 And then the people looking in the other way

3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:19.840
 are seeing you for the asshole that you're being

3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:22.080
 for judging them unrightly.

3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:24.520
 So they almost wanna say F you by not wearing the mask.

3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:26.640
 And there's this division that's created

3:03:26.640 --> 3:03:28.080
 that was heartbreaking to me

3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:31.120
 because masks like testing is a solution

3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:33.440
 that was available early on.

3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:37.080
 And if understood well, it could be deployed in a mass scale.

3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:39.200
 And it seems like there's some historical evidence

3:03:39.200 --> 3:03:41.760
 for other viruses where it does very well.

3:03:41.760 --> 3:03:42.600
 That's correct.

3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:45.760
 And so like the fact that this was politicized,

3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:48.760
 yeah, was a little bit heartbreaking.

3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:51.800
 You can find in the literature studies,

3:03:51.800 --> 3:03:54.600
 mostly of healthcare workers and influenza,

3:03:54.600 --> 3:03:57.600
 where you can actually, because you see the people every day

3:03:57.600 --> 3:03:58.440
 that can sample them,

3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:00.520
 you can actually see what masking does.

3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:04.040
 And some of them show an effect and others do not.

3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:05.600
 Then that's the problem.

3:04:05.600 --> 3:04:08.280
 Like any trial, sometimes if it's not big enough

3:04:08.280 --> 3:04:10.360
 and then people latch onto that, see,

3:04:10.360 --> 3:04:11.600
 it doesn't really work.

3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:15.000
 But I think the main issue is that in January,

3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:20.000
 both CDC and WHO said masks don't work, don't use them.

3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:22.240
 That was the kiss of death for masks

3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:25.920
 because when they then changed their mind,

3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:28.040
 they didn't say we screwed up.

3:04:28.040 --> 3:04:29.200
 They just said wear masks.

3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:33.000
 If they had said we made a mistake, we were wrong,

3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:36.560
 I think more people would have worn masks, but they didn't.

3:04:36.560 --> 3:04:39.080
 And like you said, admitting you're wrong

3:04:39.080 --> 3:04:41.400
 is like a real big part of it.

3:04:41.400 --> 3:04:43.200
 And I also think almost the better way

3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:46.560
 is not just saying you're kind of saying you're wrong,

3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:49.760
 but in January saying,

3:04:49.760 --> 3:04:52.360
 like revealing the uncertainty under which we operate.

3:04:52.360 --> 3:04:57.280
 Like actually reveal what was done with the Spanish flu

3:04:57.280 --> 3:04:59.600
 at the beginning of the previous century

3:05:01.040 --> 3:05:03.280
 because there's a lot of mass controversy then too.

3:05:03.280 --> 3:05:04.120
 It went back and forth

3:05:04.120 --> 3:05:06.920
 and that was actually the source of a lot of distrust there too.

3:05:06.920 --> 3:05:09.280
 So, and then look at influenza,

3:05:09.280 --> 3:05:11.080
 like how is it effective with that?

3:05:11.080 --> 3:05:13.880
 And just reveal this, we don't know,

3:05:13.880 --> 3:05:17.680
 but with some probability,

3:05:17.680 --> 3:05:20.080
 this is the best option we got currently.

3:05:20.080 --> 3:05:24.800
 And then in a month or two, adjust it saying that,

3:05:24.800 --> 3:05:27.840
 you know what, our like the uncertainty decreased a little bit.

3:05:27.840 --> 3:05:29.440
 We have a better idea.

3:05:29.440 --> 3:05:32.320
 Like that was an incorrect estimate,

3:05:32.320 --> 3:05:34.800
 but reveal that you're struggling.

3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:36.800
 It's not like this weird binary clock

3:05:36.800 --> 3:05:38.400
 that goes one direction or the other.

3:05:38.400 --> 3:05:41.200
 You're struggling with uncertainty.

3:05:41.200 --> 3:05:42.400
 And like trusting,

3:05:43.240 --> 3:05:45.000
 people maybe criticize me sometimes with this,

3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:48.080
 but I think most people are actually intelligent.

3:05:48.080 --> 3:05:50.920
 Like trusting the public to be intelligent

3:05:50.920 --> 3:05:54.080
 with, if you give them, if you have transparent

3:05:54.080 --> 3:05:57.720
 and give them information in a real authentic way,

3:05:57.720 --> 3:05:59.600
 like don't look like you're hiding something.

3:05:59.600 --> 3:06:01.160
 I think they're intelligent enough

3:06:01.160 --> 3:06:03.160
 to use that data to make decisions.

3:06:03.160 --> 3:06:05.120
 It's the same thing as with the testing,

3:06:05.120 --> 3:06:07.600
 is if you put that power in the people's hands

3:06:07.600 --> 3:06:08.680
 to know if they're sick or not,

3:06:08.680 --> 3:06:12.800
 they're gonna make unmasked the right decision, I think.

3:06:12.800 --> 3:06:15.520
 It's that the masks and the testing

3:06:15.520 --> 3:06:17.120
 has been a bit heartbreaking.

3:06:17.120 --> 3:06:19.440
 I think that's a good point, though,

3:06:19.440 --> 3:06:23.080
 that most people don't seem to have an objection to testing.

3:06:23.080 --> 3:06:23.920
 It's a good point.

3:06:23.920 --> 3:06:24.760
 Yes.

3:06:24.760 --> 3:06:27.960
 And then obviously Makamina makes that point brilliantly.

3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:31.560
 And still there's very little excitement around that.

3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:35.000
 But he said he was going to do it.

3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:35.840
 I don't understand.

3:06:35.840 --> 3:06:37.600
 I mean, I haven't spoken to him since then.

3:06:37.600 --> 3:06:38.720
 So I don't know why.

3:06:38.720 --> 3:06:39.560
 He's pushing it.

3:06:39.560 --> 3:06:41.640
 Well, I mean, but he can't do it alone.

3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:44.680
 He has to get, so one of the resistances,

3:06:44.680 --> 3:06:48.120
 FDA doesn't like cheap things.

3:06:48.120 --> 3:06:49.120
 Yeah.

3:06:49.120 --> 3:06:50.240
 They don't want to approve it.

3:06:50.240 --> 3:06:52.960
 So it makes the mass manufacture,

3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:55.120
 like with emergency exceptions,

3:06:55.120 --> 3:06:57.440
 all those kinds of things, very difficult.

3:06:57.440 --> 3:06:59.560
 And then there's not much money to be made on it

3:06:59.560 --> 3:07:00.800
 without that.

3:07:00.800 --> 3:07:01.640
 I don't know.

3:07:01.640 --> 3:07:04.840
 I think there's just economic pressures against it.

3:07:04.840 --> 3:07:09.840
 And because so much investment was placed on the vaccines,

3:07:10.920 --> 3:07:13.360
 and obviously there's an incentive mechanism there

3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:17.240
 where the company's lobbyists and all those,

3:07:17.240 --> 3:07:18.840
 there's this machine that says,

3:07:20.400 --> 3:07:22.080
 arguing for tests is difficult

3:07:22.080 --> 3:07:25.480
 because the thing that's worked for most severe viruses

3:07:25.480 --> 3:07:27.160
 in the past is vaccines.

3:07:27.160 --> 3:07:30.360
 Now we have vaccines, why the hell would you need tests?

3:07:30.360 --> 3:07:34.480
 At that time, like why the hell do you need tests

3:07:34.480 --> 3:07:36.080
 when we can be working on vaccines?

3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:37.720
 It seems like the obvious thing to be working

3:07:37.720 --> 3:07:40.680
 is the vaccines from their perspective.

3:07:40.680 --> 3:07:43.160
 But it's not obvious at all to me.

3:07:43.160 --> 3:07:44.440
 I think you should have both.

3:07:44.440 --> 3:07:46.600
 I think you have vaccines and good testing

3:07:46.600 --> 3:07:48.920
 and that covers you really well

3:07:48.920 --> 3:07:50.080
 because you're always going to have people

3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:52.080
 who don't get vaccinated.

3:07:52.080 --> 3:07:54.200
 I don't know if you've been paying attention to this.

3:07:54.200 --> 3:07:55.720
 There's a guy named Brett Weinstein

3:07:55.720 --> 3:07:57.760
 and there's a guy named Sam Harris.

3:07:57.760 --> 3:07:59.560
 They have good representation,

3:08:00.760 --> 3:08:05.760
 I would say of two sides of a perspective on the vaccine.

3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:09.680
 So from Sam Harris's perspective,

3:08:09.680 --> 3:08:13.240
 it's obvious that everybody should get vaccinated

3:08:13.240 --> 3:08:18.240
 and it's irresponsible to not get vaccinated.

3:08:18.560 --> 3:08:22.120
 I think he represents a lot of people's belief in that.

3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:27.120
 And then Brett talks a lot about hivermectin

3:08:28.520 --> 3:08:32.720
 but also talks about hesitancy towards the vaccine

3:08:32.720 --> 3:08:35.040
 for people who are healthy,

3:08:35.040 --> 3:08:37.600
 who are people who are younger, that kind of thing.

3:08:37.600 --> 3:08:42.600
 And saying we should consider longterm effects of the vaccine

3:08:43.080 --> 3:08:45.200
 in making this calculation.

3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:47.520
 What do you make about this conversation?

3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:49.400
 Some of it happens on Twitter,

3:08:49.400 --> 3:08:52.040
 some of it happens in the space of podcasts.

3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:56.240
 Do you pay attention to this kind of thing?

3:08:56.240 --> 3:08:58.240
 What's your role in this?

3:08:58.240 --> 3:09:02.080
 What do you hope is the way to resolve this conversation?

3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:04.040
 Do you think it's healthy?

3:09:04.040 --> 3:09:05.760
 Well, a conversation is always healthy

3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:09.320
 but to make definitive statements is not

3:09:09.320 --> 3:09:12.240
 because it suggests you have information that you don't have.

3:09:12.240 --> 3:09:16.920
 So we talked about longterm effects.

3:09:16.920 --> 3:09:18.720
 I think you need to balance those

3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:21.000
 versus longterm effects of the disease

3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:22.520
 and you can make your decision.

3:09:22.520 --> 3:09:26.600
 I don't think you need to tell everybody to get vaccinated.

3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:28.800
 I think you need to present the case.

3:09:28.800 --> 3:09:30.440
 You say here we made good vaccines,

3:09:30.440 --> 3:09:32.280
 here the safety profile,

3:09:32.280 --> 3:09:35.320
 here's the risk benefit balance and you should decide.

3:09:35.320 --> 3:09:37.920
 You're a smart person, you should decide.

3:09:37.920 --> 3:09:41.280
 Now, companies are gonna do differently, right?

3:09:41.280 --> 3:09:43.320
 Companies may say you have to be vaccinated to work here.

3:09:43.320 --> 3:09:46.760
 My employer, Columbia, said we have to be vaccinated

3:09:46.760 --> 3:09:48.440
 to work in the fall and if you wanna be a student,

3:09:48.440 --> 3:09:49.480
 you have to be vaccinated.

3:09:49.480 --> 3:09:52.280
 So you decide whether you wanna go or not.

3:09:52.280 --> 3:09:57.280
 But the idea that you should make a decision

3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:02.520
 based on longterm effects, there is no evidence, right?

3:10:02.520 --> 3:10:03.840
 So how can you make a decision

3:10:03.840 --> 3:10:05.240
 where you don't have evidence?

3:10:05.240 --> 3:10:06.320
 Whereas we do have evidence

3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:08.480
 that there are longterm effects of getting COVID.

3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:10.280
 So I don't think that's a fair argument

3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:13.680
 and it just makes people scared to say that.

3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:16.240
 But on the other hand, for some of us to say it's a no brainer

3:10:16.240 --> 3:10:19.320
 and to denigrate people for not being vaccinated,

3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:20.440
 that's not the approach either

3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:24.400
 because they're gonna dig in and say I'm not doing this

3:10:24.400 --> 3:10:25.720
 because you tell me to, right?

3:10:25.720 --> 3:10:28.640
 I think the middle ground is to say,

3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:33.640
 take a bit of both and say here are the potential issues

3:10:33.640 --> 3:10:37.320
 and here are the benefits and this is what I would do

3:10:37.320 --> 3:10:38.720
 and you have to just decide on your own.

3:10:38.720 --> 3:10:39.560
 I'd leave it to them.

3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:41.680
 I say you decide and if you don't want to,

3:10:41.680 --> 3:10:44.520
 it's up to you, you don't have to get vaccinated

3:10:44.520 --> 3:10:46.400
 and you'll probably get infected at some point

3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:47.800
 and maybe you'll be okay.

3:10:50.080 --> 3:10:51.680
 But here's the best available data

3:10:51.680 --> 3:10:56.680
 and it looks like the vaccines are pretty damn smart solution.

3:10:56.800 --> 3:10:57.640
 They seem to work.

3:10:57.640 --> 3:11:00.040
 I think you tell people what you did

3:11:00.040 --> 3:11:01.920
 and present both sides calmly

3:11:01.920 --> 3:11:04.760
 and I think digging in as like in a debate,

3:11:04.760 --> 3:11:06.960
 I don't think that's terribly useful.

3:11:06.960 --> 3:11:08.960
 So that's my view.

3:11:08.960 --> 3:11:11.840
 I mean, people come to me all the time and ask me,

3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:14.760
 I'm worried, what should I do?

3:11:14.760 --> 3:11:16.200
 And I said, what are you worried about?

3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:19.040
 Let's talk about it and go through it calmly.

3:11:19.040 --> 3:11:20.760
 And if they want to still take ivermectin,

3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:22.720
 I said, it's fine, it's your choice.

3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:23.800
 And I have a problem with that.

3:11:23.800 --> 3:11:25.040
 I love that.

3:11:25.040 --> 3:11:26.760
 I love that's the way you think.

3:11:26.760 --> 3:11:32.080
 People should definitely listen to this week in virology

3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:33.720
 and follow your work is brilliant.

3:11:33.720 --> 3:11:35.800
 I've been really enjoying it lately.

3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:38.360
 It's like, it's my favorite way to stay in touch

3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:42.200
 with the happenings of COVID.

3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:45.560
 Obviously you put in a lot of other stuff in there, but.

3:11:45.560 --> 3:11:47.800
 We used to do other viruses before COVID,

3:11:47.800 --> 3:11:50.120
 it was quite interesting.

3:11:50.120 --> 3:11:52.560
 And I'm trying to slip other viruses in

3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:56.160
 because I think they're informative in many ways

3:11:56.160 --> 3:11:57.320
 and we're going to do more and more of that.

3:11:57.320 --> 3:11:58.640
 But I have to say, I canceled,

3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:00.880
 usually I record on Tuesday and Friday

3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:03.040
 and I canceled today so I could be with you.

3:12:03.040 --> 3:12:05.080
 It's a huge honor, I appreciate that.

3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:06.720
 No, no, it's fine.

3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:07.920
 I think a couple of other people

3:12:07.920 --> 3:12:10.280
 were going to be away anyway, so.

3:12:10.280 --> 3:12:12.080
 So I do a lot of different pods.

3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:15.680
 They're all on YouTube and I also do a live stream

3:12:15.680 --> 3:12:18.480
 on Wednesday nights on YouTube, which you can find.

3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:21.400
 And that's where people can come and ask questions.

3:12:21.400 --> 3:12:23.640
 We don't have an agenda, we just start

3:12:23.640 --> 3:12:26.440
 and by 30 minutes in, there's 700 people

3:12:26.440 --> 3:12:28.600
 with questions that I can't even get through

3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:29.600
 because there's so many of them.

3:12:29.600 --> 3:12:32.920
 And I'm actually astounded that so many people

3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:35.680
 are, have really good questions.

3:12:35.680 --> 3:12:39.000
 Most of them are reasonable and they come back every week.

3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:41.920
 So it's a great, it's turning into a great forum

3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:43.280
 to have a nice discussion.

3:12:44.200 --> 3:12:46.960
 And the YouTube channel is called what?

3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:49.000
 So you could search for my name,

3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:51.320
 which is Vincent Radkin Yellow, it'll turn up

3:12:51.320 --> 3:12:56.320
 or my handle on YouTube is ProfVRR, PROFVRR.

3:13:00.040 --> 3:13:03.080
 Have you read The Plague by Camus by any chance?

3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:07.200
 Years ago, years ago, I have to read it again.

3:13:07.200 --> 3:13:08.760
 That's really relevant.

3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:10.840
 Let me ask you a question about it.

3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:14.000
 It describes a town that's overtaken by a plague

3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:16.480
 and it's blocked off from the rest of the world

3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:19.480
 and it kind of reveals the best, the worst of human nature.

3:13:19.480 --> 3:13:21.240
 That's like how people respond to that,

3:13:21.240 --> 3:13:25.120
 sort of the encroaching that their own mortality,

3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:27.240
 their own death and the horizon.

3:13:27.240 --> 3:13:30.040
 I think one of the messages in the book that

3:13:30.040 --> 3:13:34.160
 ultimately like love for others.

3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:36.800
 So it's like a lot of people want to become isolated

3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:38.440
 and they hide from each other,

3:13:38.440 --> 3:13:42.040
 but ultimately the thing that saves you is love,

3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:46.360
 which is one of the things of just watching this pandemic,

3:13:46.360 --> 3:13:48.960
 you know, with the distance, with the masks,

3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:53.880
 that's all fine, but there's a distancing from people

3:13:53.880 --> 3:13:57.200
 of that attention, the breaking

3:13:57.200 --> 3:13:59.240
 of the common humanity between people.

3:13:59.240 --> 3:14:02.280
 That's one of the reasons I, when I came to Austin

3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:05.200
 earlier this year just to visit,

3:14:05.200 --> 3:14:06.440
 I fell in love with the city

3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:09.040
 because even with the masks and the distance,

3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:14.040
 there was still a camaraderie, like, I don't know,

3:14:14.600 --> 3:14:15.800
 just a love for each other,

3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:18.040
 just a kindness towards each other.

3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:20.840
 And that's why I took away from the plague.

3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:23.440
 Mostly it's told the story of the doctor,

3:14:23.440 --> 3:14:28.440
 who basically gives in and just gives himself

3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:30.480
 as a service to others.

3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:33.000
 And that love is the thing that liberates him

3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:34.680
 from his own conception of mortality.

3:14:34.680 --> 3:14:37.920
 The fact that he's here, he's going to die.

3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:41.760
 What do you think about this, the effect of the virus?

3:14:41.760 --> 3:14:43.120
 We talked a lot about biology,

3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:48.120
 but the effect of the virus and the fabric

3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:51.400
 of the common humanity that connects us.

3:14:51.400 --> 3:14:54.240
 Well, that's what a pandemic does.

3:14:54.240 --> 3:14:56.320
 It really cuts that, right?

3:14:56.320 --> 3:14:58.480
 Because small outbreaks are local,

3:14:58.480 --> 3:15:00.920
 they don't have global effects.

3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:03.120
 But when you have something this big

3:15:03.120 --> 3:15:07.480
 where pretty much nobody escapes

3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:12.480
 and not just making people sick, it changes your life, right?

3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:14.600
 People lose jobs, they change jobs,

3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:16.120
 they move somewhere else.

3:15:17.240 --> 3:15:20.280
 They have all kinds of disruptions.

3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:23.560
 Kids can't go to school, really shows you.

3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:25.520
 I mean, I always like to say,

3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:30.280
 a tiny virus can bring earth to its knees.

3:15:30.280 --> 3:15:31.840
 A tiny virus that you can't even see

3:15:31.840 --> 3:15:33.440
 and that most people don't even think about

3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:34.360
 most of the time.

3:15:35.240 --> 3:15:37.760
 And the real effect is not just sickness,

3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:39.240
 it's what it does to people

3:15:39.240 --> 3:15:42.840
 because in the end we are animals

3:15:42.840 --> 3:15:45.320
 and most animals like each other

3:15:45.320 --> 3:15:47.640
 and they interact, they have great social structures

3:15:47.640 --> 3:15:49.800
 and that makes them do well.

3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:53.960
 I guess the exception is people in AI, right?

3:15:53.960 --> 3:15:56.640
 They could be on their own.

3:15:56.640 --> 3:15:58.960
 Well, that's why you build robots that you fall in love with.

3:15:58.960 --> 3:15:59.800
 That's right.

3:15:59.800 --> 3:16:02.000
 And so I think when a,

3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:06.080
 the real story is what it does to society for sure,

3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:08.680
 which has ramifications way beyond

3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:11.400
 the number of people dying and the vaccines

3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:12.760
 and the tests and all of that.

3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:15.680
 And this one has really made a big rupture.

3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:17.400
 And you could tell not now so much,

3:16:17.400 --> 3:16:18.720
 I think being out and about now,

3:16:18.720 --> 3:16:22.120
 things look pretty normal except,

3:16:22.120 --> 3:16:23.800
 for some people wearing masks,

3:16:23.800 --> 3:16:25.040
 you would never know.

3:16:25.040 --> 3:16:28.240
 I mean, the airport this morning was completely jammed.

3:16:28.240 --> 3:16:29.720
 People going, and they're all on vacation,

3:16:29.720 --> 3:16:31.560
 they're all wearing shorts, right?

3:16:31.560 --> 3:16:34.360
 So they're back to normal, it's August.

3:16:34.360 --> 3:16:37.720
 But last year is really different in New York

3:16:37.720 --> 3:16:40.160
 where you're used to lots of people on the street.

3:16:40.160 --> 3:16:43.080
 It was eerie, it was just quiet.

3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:46.080
 But under it all, people are still,

3:16:46.080 --> 3:16:49.080
 most people help each other when they have to, right?

3:16:50.160 --> 3:16:52.360
 Most people are willing to,

3:16:52.360 --> 3:16:55.360
 if something happens to someone to reach out and help them,

3:16:56.400 --> 3:16:58.880
 there are always exceptions where people are mean,

3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:01.960
 and that's just the way animals are.

3:17:01.960 --> 3:17:05.800
 We're not the only ones that can be mean to our own species.

3:17:05.800 --> 3:17:08.760
 But I think most of the motivation

3:17:08.760 --> 3:17:12.280
 for everything that was done is to help other people.

3:17:12.280 --> 3:17:15.640
 I mean, I do think that the vaccine manufacturers,

3:17:15.640 --> 3:17:18.200
 maybe not the leaders, but the people working in the labs

3:17:18.200 --> 3:17:22.800
 really wanted to get this out quickly and help people, right?

3:17:22.800 --> 3:17:26.400
 I think at every level, people who are contributing

3:17:26.400 --> 3:17:28.040
 really wanted to help other people

3:17:28.040 --> 3:17:30.240
 and feel proud that they're able to do that.

3:17:30.240 --> 3:17:34.800
 So I view it as, we're never gonna be 100% good

3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:39.480
 because animals are not, evolution made us.

3:17:39.480 --> 3:17:41.760
 I mean, we're lucky, we somehow rose above

3:17:41.760 --> 3:17:44.200
 by having incredible brain and so forth.

3:17:44.200 --> 3:17:46.280
 But a lot of our base instincts are animals,

3:17:46.280 --> 3:17:50.440
 and they chase each other and have alpha males

3:17:50.440 --> 3:17:51.280
 and all that stuff.

3:17:51.280 --> 3:17:53.520
 And we always have a little bit of that in us.

3:17:53.520 --> 3:17:58.520
 But we do have some humanity that this really ripped up,

3:17:59.120 --> 3:18:00.000
 it really did.

3:18:01.040 --> 3:18:03.760
 And I think for me, someone who studied,

3:18:03.760 --> 3:18:07.840
 viruses for over 40 years, it's just amazing

3:18:07.840 --> 3:18:11.320
 that an invisible thing can do that, right?

3:18:11.320 --> 3:18:13.400
 It goes back to the thing you found fascinating,

3:18:13.400 --> 3:18:15.600
 which is a virus affecting human behavior

3:18:15.600 --> 3:18:17.680
 or behavior of the organism.

3:18:18.720 --> 3:18:22.960
 Yes, so humans can make weapons and do harm

3:18:22.960 --> 3:18:25.440
 and you can see that, but this you can't even see.

3:18:25.440 --> 3:18:27.680
 You can't, and look what it has done.

3:18:27.680 --> 3:18:29.760
 And it'll do it again, there'll be more.

3:18:29.760 --> 3:18:32.840
 I just, I wish we would be more prepared

3:18:32.840 --> 3:18:34.840
 because we know what to do.

3:18:34.840 --> 3:18:38.920
 We know we should be making antivirals vaccines masks,

3:18:38.920 --> 3:18:42.120
 testing masks, making test modalities

3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:46.080
 that we can really quickly redesign.

3:18:46.080 --> 3:18:49.120
 But after SARS one, all that went out the door.

3:18:49.120 --> 3:18:50.200
 People didn't do anything.

3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:51.920
 And that's why we're in this situation.

3:18:51.920 --> 3:18:54.880
 So, people ask me this all the time,

3:18:54.880 --> 3:18:57.840
 are we gonna be ready for the next one?

3:18:57.840 --> 3:18:59.560
 And I always say, we should be.

3:18:59.560 --> 3:19:03.040
 We have all the information we need to know what to do.

3:19:03.040 --> 3:19:05.880
 But somehow, I think people forget.

3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:12.800
 That said, sometimes we really step up

3:19:12.800 --> 3:19:14.880
 when the tragedy is right in front of us.

3:19:14.880 --> 3:19:15.720
 We do.

3:19:15.720 --> 3:19:16.560
 When the catastrophic.

3:19:16.560 --> 3:19:18.760
 So, I don't know, somehow humans have still survived.

3:19:18.760 --> 3:19:21.080
 The fact that we had nuclear weapons for so many decades

3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:23.160
 and we're still not blowing each other up,

3:19:23.160 --> 3:19:25.000
 whether by terrorists or by nation,

3:19:25.000 --> 3:19:25.840
 is amazing.

3:19:25.840 --> 3:19:27.160
 It's quite surprising.

3:19:27.160 --> 3:19:30.600
 That's always, after reading the Pentagon Papers,

3:19:30.600 --> 3:19:32.920
 it's even more amazing, right?

3:19:32.920 --> 3:19:34.400
 So, I don't know how we do it.

3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:39.400
 I tend to believe there's that at the surface,

3:19:40.240 --> 3:19:43.480
 you notice the greed, the corruption, the evil,

3:19:43.480 --> 3:19:46.560
 but the core of human nature, the human spirit,

3:19:46.560 --> 3:19:50.840
 is one in the scientific realm is curiosity.

3:19:50.840 --> 3:19:54.320
 And more deeply is kindness, compassion,

3:19:54.320 --> 3:19:56.840
 and wanting to do good for the world.

3:19:56.840 --> 3:20:00.160
 I believe that desire to do good outpowers

3:20:00.160 --> 3:20:03.000
 all the other stuff by a large amount.

3:20:03.000 --> 3:20:06.480
 And that's why we don't, we have not yet destroyed ourselves.

3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:08.280
 We kind of, there's a lot of bickering.

3:20:08.280 --> 3:20:11.480
 There's a lot of wars on the surface, but underneath it all,

3:20:11.480 --> 3:20:16.200
 there's this ocean of love for each other.

3:20:16.200 --> 3:20:20.000
 I mean, I think there's an evolutionary advantage to that.

3:20:21.280 --> 3:20:23.600
 And it would be a good explanation

3:20:23.600 --> 3:20:25.440
 why we still haven't destroyed ourselves.

3:20:25.440 --> 3:20:27.440
 Wow, we had so many opportunities.

3:20:27.440 --> 3:20:30.520
 If you look at all the wars in history, so many.

3:20:30.520 --> 3:20:33.400
 I was just, my son was telling me

3:20:33.400 --> 3:20:35.920
 about the Ottoman Empire, right?

3:20:35.920 --> 3:20:39.560
 I mean, it's just, war after war,

3:20:39.560 --> 3:20:42.160
 and then other countries splitting up countries

3:20:42.160 --> 3:20:45.360
 with no regard to who's living where, right?

3:20:46.600 --> 3:20:49.480
 It's just, how can these people do this?

3:20:49.480 --> 3:20:50.880
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:52.080
 Human history is fascinating.

3:20:52.080 --> 3:20:54.640
 And we're still young as a species.

3:20:54.640 --> 3:20:57.400
 We have a lot more time to go

3:20:57.400 --> 3:21:00.560
 and a lot more wasted to destroy ourselves.

3:21:00.560 --> 3:21:02.280
 Do you have advice, like you said,

3:21:02.280 --> 3:21:03.920
 you have many decades of research

3:21:03.920 --> 3:21:06.440
 and incredible career and life.

3:21:06.440 --> 3:21:09.920
 Do you have advice for young people about career,

3:21:09.920 --> 3:21:13.400
 about life, people in high school, people in college,

3:21:13.400 --> 3:21:16.520
 of how to live a life that can be proud of?

3:21:17.480 --> 3:21:20.760
 So what I like to do is tell people, don't plan it

3:21:20.760 --> 3:21:22.400
 because I didn't plan anything.

3:21:22.400 --> 3:21:25.040
 Everything I did was one step at a time.

3:21:25.040 --> 3:21:26.680
 You don't have to plan.

3:21:26.680 --> 3:21:30.840
 I just found things that were interesting to me.

3:21:30.840 --> 3:21:33.480
 And so my father was a doctor

3:21:33.480 --> 3:21:35.800
 and he wanted me to be a doctor,

3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:39.080
 but I was not interested in taking care of people.

3:21:39.080 --> 3:21:43.200
 I learned that, but I couldn't say no to him.

3:21:43.200 --> 3:21:48.200
 So I was a biology major in college and I graduated

3:21:48.240 --> 3:21:51.720
 and I didn't have anything to do.

3:21:51.720 --> 3:21:53.600
 So I liked science.

3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:57.720
 So I got a job in a lab and it was very exciting.

3:21:57.720 --> 3:22:00.720
 And that led to everything else

3:22:00.720 --> 3:22:02.920
 that I've done one step at a time.

3:22:02.920 --> 3:22:05.840
 And I think the most important thing you can do,

3:22:05.840 --> 3:22:07.000
 whether two important things,

3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:08.680
 you can be really curious all the time.

3:22:08.680 --> 3:22:10.080
 You mentioned curiosity.

3:22:10.080 --> 3:22:12.040
 I think curiosity is essential.

3:22:13.040 --> 3:22:15.600
 You have to be curious about everything.

3:22:15.600 --> 3:22:18.160
 And if you are, you're never gonna be bored.

3:22:19.280 --> 3:22:20.960
 And so people who say they're bored,

3:22:20.960 --> 3:22:22.520
 I say, you are not curious.

3:22:22.520 --> 3:22:24.200
 You should just think about things

3:22:24.200 --> 3:22:27.440
 and say, look at something and say, how does that work?

3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:28.560
 Or what is it doing?

3:22:28.560 --> 3:22:29.400
 And how do they get there?

3:22:29.400 --> 3:22:30.480
 And you'll never be bored.

3:22:30.480 --> 3:22:32.840
 And the other thing is when you find something,

3:22:32.840 --> 3:22:35.320
 which may take time, it's fine.

3:22:36.960 --> 3:22:38.560
 You have to be passionate about it.

3:22:38.560 --> 3:22:40.880
 You have to put everything into it.

3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:42.920
 And that's what I did with viruses.

3:22:42.920 --> 3:22:46.240
 So I think they're amazing.

3:22:46.240 --> 3:22:51.160
 And I tell my classes, I love viruses.

3:22:51.160 --> 3:22:52.000
 They're amazing.

3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:53.120
 And people think I'm morbid

3:22:53.120 --> 3:22:55.320
 because obviously they kill people

3:22:55.320 --> 3:22:56.560
 and I shouldn't love something that,

3:22:56.560 --> 3:22:57.480
 but that's not the point.

3:22:57.480 --> 3:22:58.320
 That's not what I mean.

3:22:58.320 --> 3:23:00.520
 I love them in the way they have emerged

3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:03.080
 and how they work and so forth

3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:04.240
 and all that we don't know about them.

3:23:04.240 --> 3:23:06.240
 So you need to be curious and passionate

3:23:06.240 --> 3:23:07.720
 and don't plan too much.

3:23:07.720 --> 3:23:11.020
 And just find something that you don't call a job.

3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:14.520
 Because someone said on the live stream last week,

3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:17.360
 I wish I had a job I liked as much as you.

3:23:17.360 --> 3:23:18.440
 I said, it's not a job.

3:23:18.440 --> 3:23:20.400
 I never looked at it as a job.

3:23:20.400 --> 3:23:21.960
 It's my vocation.

3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:23.720
 It's my passion.

3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:25.880
 If it's a job, then you're not gonna like it.

3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:28.400
 Yeah, something that doesn't feel like a job.

3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:33.000
 So you said viruses are kind of passive,

3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:35.680
 nonliving, you could say.

3:23:36.880 --> 3:23:38.520
 Or even cells are passive.

3:23:38.520 --> 3:23:39.840
 And humans are kind of active.

3:23:39.840 --> 3:23:42.320
 We seem to be making our own decisions.

3:23:42.320 --> 3:23:44.720
 So let me ask you the why question.

3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:47.600
 What do you think is the meaning of this life of ours?

3:23:48.800 --> 3:23:49.800
 Oh, there's no meaning.

3:23:49.800 --> 3:23:51.360
 It just happened.

3:23:51.360 --> 3:23:52.320
 It's an accident.

3:23:53.520 --> 3:23:55.040
 I think there's no life elsewhere

3:23:55.040 --> 3:23:57.360
 because this is just a rare accident that happened

3:23:57.360 --> 3:23:58.680
 and the right conditions.

3:23:58.680 --> 3:24:00.320
 I mean, people all think I'm wrong

3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:02.880
 because there are billions and billions of stars out there.

3:24:02.880 --> 3:24:05.200
 So there's a lot of opportunity.

3:24:05.200 --> 3:24:06.320
 There's no meaning.

3:24:06.320 --> 3:24:10.520
 It's just a, what do they call it?

3:24:10.520 --> 3:24:12.680
 A perfect storm of events

3:24:12.680 --> 3:24:15.800
 that led to molecules being formed and eventually,

3:24:15.800 --> 3:24:19.920
 I mean, it took a long time for life to evolve, right?

3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:24.040
 But it's just driven by conditions.

3:24:24.040 --> 3:24:25.560
 If something emerged that worked,

3:24:25.560 --> 3:24:27.000
 it would then go on to the next step.

3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:29.160
 There's no meaning other than that.

3:24:29.160 --> 3:24:31.120
 The only difference is that we,

3:24:32.200 --> 3:24:34.080
 I don't think many other animals can probably,

3:24:34.080 --> 3:24:36.040
 we have the ability, we're sentient, right?

3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:38.240
 We can influence what happens to us.

3:24:38.240 --> 3:24:41.480
 We can take medicines, right?

3:24:41.480 --> 3:24:44.480
 We can alter what would normally happen to us

3:24:44.480 --> 3:24:47.880
 so we can remove some of the selection pressure.

3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:52.760
 But I think everything else on the planet just goes,

3:24:52.760 --> 3:24:55.200
 looks for food and give a lot of offspring

3:24:55.200 --> 3:24:56.280
 so you can perpetuate.

3:24:56.280 --> 3:24:58.720
 It's just a natural biological function.

3:24:58.720 --> 3:25:02.000
 Yeah, they're much more directly concerned with survival.

3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:04.680
 I think humans are able to contemplate their mortality.

3:25:04.680 --> 3:25:08.520
 We can see that even if we're okay today,

3:25:08.520 --> 3:25:10.320
 we're eventually going to die

3:25:10.320 --> 3:25:13.040
 and we really don't like that.

3:25:13.040 --> 3:25:14.400
 So we try to come up with ways

3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:17.040
 to push that deadline farther and farther away.

3:25:17.040 --> 3:25:18.440
 Well, we have really,

3:25:18.440 --> 3:25:20.440
 I mean, we used to die in our 30s, right?

3:25:20.440 --> 3:25:22.080
 Now it's 70s, 80s.

3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:26.120
 Well, most of us used to die in the first few weeks.

3:25:26.120 --> 3:25:27.280
 That's true.

3:25:27.280 --> 3:25:29.120
 Yeah, infant death.

3:25:29.120 --> 3:25:34.120
 I always tell people the only thing that's 100% is death.

3:25:34.120 --> 3:25:36.240
 It's the only thing in the world that's 100%.

3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:37.800
 Do you think about your own mortality?

3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:38.960
 Yeah, I never think about it.

3:25:38.960 --> 3:25:41.720
 I'm just enjoying day to day.

3:25:41.720 --> 3:25:42.560
 And I don't think about it.

3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:44.080
 Really, you work on viruses.

3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:47.480
 You don't contemplate your own mortality

3:25:47.480 --> 3:25:51.600
 given the deadliness of the virus around us.

3:25:51.600 --> 3:25:53.520
 I never thought COVID would kill me.

3:25:53.520 --> 3:25:56.200
 No, I never was afraid of that, not at all.

3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:00.280
 I've mostly feared for other people getting sick,

3:26:00.280 --> 3:26:02.280
 especially people who could die of it

3:26:02.280 --> 3:26:03.520
 and want that to happen to them.

3:26:03.520 --> 3:26:05.600
 But I always thought that,

3:26:05.600 --> 3:26:10.600
 it's obviously not a realistic viewpoint not to be worried

3:26:11.680 --> 3:26:13.800
 because many people are,

3:26:13.800 --> 3:26:16.040
 but I've been relatively healthy.

3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:18.440
 They should sequence my genome

3:26:18.440 --> 3:26:21.240
 because it works really well and have a good immune system.

3:26:21.240 --> 3:26:24.080
 Maybe you'd be the first immortal person.

3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:24.920
 I don't think so.

3:26:24.920 --> 3:26:25.760
 There's gotta be a first.

3:26:25.760 --> 3:26:27.120
 I don't think so.

3:26:27.120 --> 3:26:31.040
 I think that biologically, you just can't,

3:26:31.040 --> 3:26:32.520
 you know, the ends of our chromosomes

3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:34.360
 keep getting shorter and shorter

3:26:34.360 --> 3:26:36.120
 and that's eventually what kills us.

3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:39.600
 So you just can't keep going on.

3:26:39.600 --> 3:26:42.200
 But that's fine, I don't need to.

3:26:42.200 --> 3:26:43.680
 I understand from the vampires

3:26:43.680 --> 3:26:45.400
 that it's not good to live forever.

3:26:47.320 --> 3:26:50.400
 I guess make the most of the time you got.

3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:53.200
 That's the, bacteria live a much shorter time.

3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:55.160
 So we got that on bacteria.

3:26:55.160 --> 3:26:59.120
 Bacteria are just, you know, little bags of chemicals

3:26:59.120 --> 3:27:00.120
 that split.

3:27:00.120 --> 3:27:05.120
 So they have no, they have no stake in the matter at all.

3:27:05.400 --> 3:27:06.240
 It doesn't bother.

3:27:06.240 --> 3:27:08.200
 And I think you have to go a long ways

3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:13.000
 before you get into some kind of consciousness, but.

3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:15.440
 Yes, weird that this bag of chemicals

3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:17.040
 has a stake in the matter.

3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:21.400
 Like our human body is a consciousness is a weird thing.

3:27:21.400 --> 3:27:23.560
 Not just in us, but they make half of the oxygen

3:27:23.560 --> 3:27:24.400
 on the planet.

3:27:24.400 --> 3:27:26.400
 20% of the oxygen comes from bacteria.

3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:29.920
 And they made, in the beginning of Earth,

3:27:29.920 --> 3:27:34.120
 they made enough oxygen to start oxygenation going,

3:27:34.120 --> 3:27:34.960
 life going.

3:27:34.960 --> 3:27:36.560
 I mean, it's, they have an incredible role.

3:27:36.560 --> 3:27:37.520
 It's all an accident.

3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:38.360
 Just happen.

3:27:40.520 --> 3:27:44.680
 Well, Vincent, like I told you, I'm a huge fan.

3:27:44.680 --> 3:27:47.080
 It's a big honor that you were talking with me today.

3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:48.440
 Thank you so much for coming down.

3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:50.720
 Thank you for spending so much time with me.

3:27:51.720 --> 3:27:54.080
 And thank you for everything you do in terms of educating

3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:56.440
 about viruses, about biology, microbiology

3:27:56.440 --> 3:27:57.360
 and everything else.

3:27:57.360 --> 3:27:58.200
 I can't wait.

3:27:58.200 --> 3:28:00.600
 Everybody should check out Vincent's YouTube,

3:28:00.600 --> 3:28:03.080
 watch his lectures, listen to the podcast.

3:28:03.080 --> 3:28:05.080
 It's truly incredible.

3:28:05.080 --> 3:28:06.800
 Thank you so much for talking, Davidson.

3:28:06.800 --> 3:28:08.280
 My pleasure.

3:28:08.280 --> 3:28:10.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:28:10.240 --> 3:28:12.280
 with Vincent Racaniello.

3:28:16.600 --> 3:28:18.760
 And now let me leave you with some words

3:28:18.760 --> 3:28:21.000
 from Isaac Asimov.

3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:23.160
 The saddest aspect of life right now

3:28:23.160 --> 3:28:25.400
 is that science gathers knowledge

3:28:25.400 --> 3:28:28.800
 faster than society gathers wisdom.

3:28:28.800 --> 3:28:56.360
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
