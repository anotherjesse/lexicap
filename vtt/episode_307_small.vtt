00:00.000 --> 00:05.320
 The following is a conversation with Brian Armstrong, cofounder and CEO of Coinbase,

00:05.320 --> 00:11.720
 the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform with 98 million users in 100 countries, listing

00:11.720 --> 00:17.360
 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and over 100 popular cryptocurrencies.

00:17.360 --> 00:22.800
 I recorded this conversation with Brian before this week's SEC probe into whether some of

00:22.800 --> 00:28.000
 the crypto listings are securities and thus need to be regulated as such.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
 As always, with conversations that involve cryptocurrency, I try to make it timeless

00:33.000 --> 00:39.760
 so that the price soaring high or crashing down low doesn't distract from the fundamental,

00:39.760 --> 00:46.080
 technological, economic, social, and philosophical ideas underlying this new form of money, energy,

00:46.080 --> 00:47.920
 and information.

00:47.920 --> 00:53.760
 Our world runs on money, the exchange and store of value, and cryptocurrency seeks

00:53.760 --> 00:58.720
 to build the next chapter of how money works and what it can do.

00:58.720 --> 01:04.360
 Coinbase and Brian are trying to do this by working together with regulators and governments,

01:04.360 --> 01:06.760
 which is a long and difficult road.

01:06.760 --> 01:11.280
 Bureaucracies resist change, for better and for worse.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.320
 The latest SEC probe is a good representation of this.

01:14.320 --> 01:20.920
 It is a serious attempt to limit fraud, but one that also runs the risk of limiting innovation

01:20.920 --> 01:24.560
 and limiting financial freedom of individuals.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.400
 This is a complicated mess, and I applaud everyone involved for trying to work through

01:28.400 --> 01:29.400
 it.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.160
 I hope in the end, the interest of the individual wins.

01:33.160 --> 01:39.480
 Decentralization, after all, is a hedge against the corrupting nature of centralized power.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.400
 This is the Lux Freedom and Podcast.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.880
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:44.880 --> 01:49.360
 And now, dear friends, here's Brian Armstrong.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.200
 Let's start with the fact that you're a programmer.

01:51.200 --> 01:56.000
 What was the first program you've ever written, or the first one you did that you remember?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.600
 The first memory I have of programming was probably in middle school.

01:59.600 --> 02:05.120
 And I remember it was recess, and they had this time period where you could read books,

02:05.120 --> 02:08.240
 and the other kids were reading comic books and stuff.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.840
 For some reason, I had gotten into this idea that I wanted to get into computers, and I

02:11.840 --> 02:14.000
 was playing with computers at home.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.080
 And so I got this book, I think, from the library, and it was called How to Learn Java

02:18.080 --> 02:19.640
 in 30 Days.

02:19.640 --> 02:26.000
 So I was reading this book at the recess, and I didn't understand anything.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.880
 And I remember I went home, and I tried to get this thing working.

02:29.880 --> 02:34.120
 And if you've ever written a Java program, the first lines are like, public static, void

02:34.120 --> 02:36.040
 main string args, or whatever.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.480
 And it's so foreign, and it's so difficult to get started.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.480
 And so I was kind of frustrated.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.360
 I was like, I don't understand anything that's happening in this book.

02:43.360 --> 02:48.400
 So the first thing I wrote was probably just like a Hello World app in Java.

02:48.400 --> 02:54.240
 But it was so, I felt like I was so confused about what was actually happening that I later

02:54.240 --> 02:59.000
 learned a bit of PHP, and PHP was like more fun for me because it was like, oh, just print

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
 out what you want.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
 You know?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.160
 It didn't have all this complexity around it.

03:02.160 --> 03:08.160
 So then I got more into PHP, started building like some simple websites, I think, learned

03:08.160 --> 03:09.160
 some HTML.

03:09.160 --> 03:13.560
 So I think that was my introduction to programming, at least the very beginning part.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.560
 Yeah.

03:14.560 --> 03:21.000
 You know, Java has a lot of, out of all the Hello Worlds, it can possibly be right.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.600
 Java is the one where I think it's the longest, which is quite interesting because Java is

03:25.600 --> 03:29.480
 often, at least for a long time, was used as the primary programming language to teach

03:29.480 --> 03:32.720
 people how to program, or at least about objectoring and programming.

03:32.720 --> 03:36.840
 I think most universities have now switched, and high school switched to Python.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.080
 I'm not sure if that's the case.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.080
 Probably better.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.080
 It's easier to learn.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.080
 It makes it less scary.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.680
 It's like less of a hurdle.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.320
 And certainly none of them use PHP.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.400
 I love PHP, and I feel like it's a dirty secret.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.920
 I have to keep private to myself, like it's somebody I'm seeing on the side or something

03:52.920 --> 03:57.000
 like that, because it's just not a respected programming language, because I think there's

03:57.000 --> 04:01.960
 so many ways you can write poor code with PHP, which is why it's not respected.

04:01.960 --> 04:02.960
 Yeah.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.240
 It's a scripting language more so, although, of course, Facebook built like a huge stack

04:06.240 --> 04:10.360
 on top of it and valuable company, but I still love Ruby to this day.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.600
 Ruby is probably my favorite language.

04:12.600 --> 04:17.200
 Python's great too, but I just love the idea behind Ruby that it's like, let's make it

04:17.200 --> 04:22.080
 easier for the human, harder for the computer, and make it a joy to be expressive and all

04:22.080 --> 04:23.080
 these things.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.200
 So, I was never the best computer scientist, but I was a good hacker.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.600
 I could rapidly prototype products and using languages like Ruby.

04:30.600 --> 04:35.480
 Do a lot of computer science programs still use like Lisp and Scheme and things like that?

04:35.480 --> 04:36.480
 No.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.480
 No.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.480
 They do.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.480
 That's like, that's if you're hardcore.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.240
 If you're legit, you're going to do some of the functional languages.

04:42.240 --> 04:48.040
 I think there's a few others that popped up, but Lisp is a distant memory for a lot of

04:48.040 --> 04:49.040
 people.

04:49.040 --> 04:55.000
 That's like somebody is like, you go to library, you dust off the book, but Scheme a little

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
 bit.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.960
 I think if you're starting, I mean, there's courses about languages themselves, like programming

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
 languages.

05:00.960 --> 05:01.960
 Yeah.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.960
 Lisp might be one of those.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.640
 You know how there's languages that nobody uses anymore?

05:05.640 --> 05:06.640
 Like ancient languages?

05:06.640 --> 05:07.640
 Yeah.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.760
 You might have to go to school in that same way for programming languages.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.720
 Back in the day, we used to use parentheses.

05:12.720 --> 05:20.400
 I, of course, still use Emacs as the editor for most things that I do, and Emacs is a

05:20.400 --> 05:22.960
 lot of the customization you could do is in Lisp.

05:22.960 --> 05:23.960
 Yeah.

05:23.960 --> 05:30.280
 And that's the language probably when I first really fell in love with programming as Lisp.

05:30.280 --> 05:35.840
 Because for a long time throughout the earlier history of artificial intelligence, Lisp was

05:35.840 --> 05:42.240
 the primary language, but it still had a life in the nineties in the aughts where some people

05:42.240 --> 05:43.240
 would use it.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.240
 Yeah.

05:44.240 --> 05:51.840
 It's such a beautiful functional language, but it just somehow didn't pick up.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.880
 That said, I should say, sort of push back PHP.

05:53.880 --> 05:59.080
 I feel like it's still true that most of the web runs on PHP.

05:59.080 --> 06:05.440
 It's still PHP, so if you look at, you know, it's like the stuff that people don't talk

06:05.440 --> 06:11.520
 about is like what runs most systems in the world, what runs most back end, what runs

06:11.520 --> 06:12.520
 most front end?

06:12.520 --> 06:13.520
 Yeah.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.520
 JavaScript.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.520
 You know, HTML.

06:15.520 --> 06:19.360
 JavaScript, I think, the Stack Exchange surveys show JavaScript is the most popular language

06:19.360 --> 06:20.360
 in the world, I think, right?

06:20.360 --> 06:21.360
 Oh, yeah.

06:21.360 --> 06:25.560
 In terms of programmers and numbers, I wonder.

06:25.560 --> 06:29.280
 I surveyed a number of programmers on Stack, Stack Overflow.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.480
 Yeah, but that's also the cutting edge, right?

06:31.480 --> 06:34.480
 Those are the people that are just like excitedly writing codes.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.480
 That's true.

06:35.480 --> 06:40.360
 I wonder if there's people that are just like maintaining gigantic code bases.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.360
 Yeah.

06:41.360 --> 06:46.360
 I feel like the amount of Java out there just running industrial systems has got to be enormous.

06:46.360 --> 06:51.560
 And then of course, in the banking industry, finance, it's like even older stuff, cobalt

06:51.560 --> 06:52.560
 and whatnot.

06:52.560 --> 07:00.960
 I've been actually looking for somebody to interview who represents cobalt and fortune.

07:00.960 --> 07:05.080
 Like who's the figure still there that holds the flag?

07:05.080 --> 07:11.440
 I did, you know, Java founder of Java, creator of Java, creator of Python, creator of C++,

07:11.440 --> 07:14.560
 but nobody wants to hold the flag for cobalt and fortune.

07:14.560 --> 07:20.560
 Even though some of the most important systems in the world still run on those, like power

07:20.560 --> 07:26.400
 systems and infrastructure systems, which is fascinating, which in ATMs and stuff like

07:26.400 --> 07:32.160
 that, like a lot of stuff that we rely on that just works and the reason we don't change

07:32.160 --> 07:37.080
 it because it works well is written in, which is that people don't use anymore.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.080
 Yeah.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.720
 That'd be a cool series of interviews.

07:39.720 --> 07:44.880
 Get the stuff that's like tech that was invented 40, 50 years ago, but still is being used

07:44.880 --> 07:45.880
 widely.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.200
 I mean, Emacs is an example of that.

07:47.200 --> 07:54.080
 Let me ask the big question of what are cryptocurrency exchanges and what's Coinbase?

07:54.080 --> 07:55.080
 How does it work?

07:55.080 --> 08:00.200
 Before, I'll ask even bigger questions, but it's just a nice kind of palette cleansing

08:00.200 --> 08:03.200
 question of what is Coinbase?

08:03.200 --> 08:09.840
 Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange, brokerage, custodian, basically, we're the primary financial

08:09.840 --> 08:14.280
 account for people in the crypto economy, how they buy crypto, how they store it, how

08:14.280 --> 08:18.840
 they use it increasingly in different ways, we can talk about that.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.880
 We want to be the way that a billion people hopefully access the open financial system

08:22.880 --> 08:23.880
 globally.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.480
 How does it work?

08:27.480 --> 08:29.880
 What's cryptocurrency?

08:29.880 --> 08:35.000
 There's Bitcoin, there's Ethereum.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.440
 What does it mean to be an exchange?

08:37.440 --> 08:38.440
 What does it mean to store?

08:38.440 --> 08:41.400
 What does it mean to transact?

08:41.400 --> 08:44.040
 What does Coinbase actually do?

08:44.040 --> 08:48.440
 Basically, in any given market, there's some people who want to buy, some people who want

08:48.440 --> 08:56.320
 to sell, and you keep an order book of all those prices, and then if someone's willing

08:56.320 --> 09:02.240
 to buy for the lowest price someone is willing to sell, then you get a trade to execute.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.000
 That's kind of how an exchange works underneath.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.840
 A brokerage is kind of simpler than that even.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.360
 You don't have to look at the whole order book and everything, but you just go in there

09:10.360 --> 09:14.600
 and you say, I want to buy $100 of Bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency, you get a quote

09:14.600 --> 09:17.480
 and if you like it, you can hit accept.

09:17.480 --> 09:21.720
 The core things that we do to make all that kind of just work, make it seamless, it sounds

09:21.720 --> 09:27.120
 simple on the surface, is we have to do payment integrations in a variety of places around

09:27.120 --> 09:31.800
 the world to make it easy for people to get fiat currency into this ecosystem.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.540
 We have to work on cybersecurity a lot, there's lots of hackers out there trying to break

09:35.540 --> 09:39.880
 into our systems and steal crypto or to put stolen credit cards and bank accounts and

09:39.880 --> 09:43.040
 things like that into these systems.

09:43.040 --> 09:47.720
 We have to integrate with the blockchains themselves, which are periodically getting

09:47.720 --> 09:51.920
 updated and having various airdrops and all kinds of things, so we're integrated with

09:51.920 --> 09:52.920
 lots of different blockchains.

09:52.920 --> 09:57.440
 Then we have to store the crypto that people buy securely as well.

09:57.440 --> 10:01.440
 Crypto is kind of like storing, you store the private keys essentially, and we've invented

10:01.440 --> 10:07.240
 a lot of cool technology about how to do that securely that helps me sleep at night as one

10:07.240 --> 10:10.680
 of the largest crypto custodians out there.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.680
 Those are some of the pieces that had to come together to get that early simple buy sell

10:14.680 --> 10:17.680
 experience to work.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.160
 I mean Coinbase actually has a lot of different products now.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.240
 We have an institutional product.

10:22.240 --> 10:26.240
 We have Coinbase Commerce, which is like merchant payments, like Stripe for crypto.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.800
 We've got a self custodial wallet, which we can talk about.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.160
 There's all kinds of cool applications people are building with Web 3, and they can access

10:32.160 --> 10:33.160
 it through that.

10:33.160 --> 10:37.160
 We just launched an NFT product, I've gone down the list.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.720
 We're sort of like a portfolio of crypto products now.

10:39.720 --> 10:43.640
 We're big enough where we can do multiple things, but yeah, the core thing we got started

10:43.640 --> 10:46.920
 with and still the majority of our revenue today is people just want to come in and buy

10:46.920 --> 10:51.480
 and sell some crypto, and we help them do that and make it simple and easy to use.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.960
 I'll ask you about wallet and NFTs.

10:53.960 --> 10:54.960
 What is it called?

10:54.960 --> 10:55.960
 The Stripe type?

10:55.960 --> 10:56.960
 Yeah, Coinbase Commerce.

10:56.960 --> 10:57.960
 Coinbase Commerce.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.960
 Yeah.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.400
 I'll ask you about all that, but order books in exchange.

11:01.400 --> 11:06.280
 What's the difference between that and stocks, for example, which there's also order books.

11:06.280 --> 11:07.280
 Yeah.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.600
 I mean, stocks trade through order books too, sort of commodities.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.560
 There's all similar type of situations.

11:12.560 --> 11:17.880
 When I want to buy one Bitcoin, and I see Coinbase say the price of that Bitcoin is

11:17.880 --> 11:23.840
 say $40,000, and I press buy, what happens?

11:23.840 --> 11:24.840
 Yeah.

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
 Okay.

11:25.840 --> 11:31.600
 So you've gotten a lot, when you press the button on your keyboard, like an electrical

11:31.600 --> 11:35.160
 signal goes up the wire on your keyboard, now we won't cut down the level.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.160
 That's also important, the timing, right, because isn't that price fixed?

11:38.160 --> 11:39.160
 Yeah.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.160
 Yeah, that's true.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.160
 It's giving you a quote.

11:41.160 --> 11:48.680
 There's a whole concept of slippage, and by the time the quote is executed, if the price

11:48.680 --> 11:53.000
 has moved too much, we may reject it, and there's various things like that.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.040
 But what's the simple version I can give you?

11:55.040 --> 11:59.160
 So we'll basically check the order book, give you a quote.

11:59.160 --> 12:04.200
 It's good for some period of time, or for some amount of slippage, and then what's happening

12:04.200 --> 12:08.240
 is we're initiating a debit to your payment method, whether that's a credit card or a

12:08.240 --> 12:12.760
 bank count, or you're storing dollars, euros, or something on our platform, there's various

12:12.760 --> 12:17.880
 payment methods, so we're basically debiting that, and then we're crediting you the crypto,

12:17.880 --> 12:19.720
 and we're taking a fee for it, too.

12:19.720 --> 12:24.240
 So that's fundamentally what's happening underneath.

12:24.240 --> 12:29.840
 And then there's some interesting slippage, how do you calculate how much slippage is

12:29.840 --> 12:30.840
 allowed?

12:30.840 --> 12:37.600
 How do you know these things, because order books are fascinating, the dynamics of that

12:37.600 --> 12:41.400
 is pretty interesting from the little I know about it.

12:41.400 --> 12:45.560
 So there's a lot of people, like traders, who get super into this, and high frequency

12:45.560 --> 12:48.400
 traders, and arbitrage, and all kinds of interesting topics.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.920
 Flash Boys was an interesting book on this whole thing.

12:50.920 --> 12:56.480
 You want accessed information to the fastest, sometimes even putting your thing in the data

12:56.480 --> 12:58.120
 center right next to the thing.

12:58.120 --> 13:03.480
 But we don't allow that colo stuff, because we want it to be more democratized.

13:03.480 --> 13:07.080
 But basically, let's say we wanted to just keep it math simple.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.760
 We want to charge a 1% fee.

13:08.760 --> 13:14.480
 So if you're buying $100 of Bitcoin, and we'll charge you $101, we've presented you the amount

13:14.480 --> 13:16.360
 of Bitcoin you're going to get for the $100.

13:16.360 --> 13:21.080
 Now let's say 10 seconds later, you hit accept, we go to fill the order.

13:21.080 --> 13:25.480
 So it's going to be some error bound around that 1% fee, right?

13:25.480 --> 13:29.600
 And if we think we're actually losing money on the trade, I think we'll often reject it.

13:29.600 --> 13:37.640
 So some part of the fee, the slippage is incorporated into that, averaged over a large number of

13:37.640 --> 13:38.640
 people.

13:38.640 --> 13:43.840
 It's fascinating, because even just that little detail probably requires a lot of experimentation.

13:43.840 --> 13:44.840
 Yeah.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.680
 And it's kind of like a giant bug bounty out there, because if you get it wrong, there's

13:48.680 --> 13:50.080
 people who are going to arbitrage that.

13:50.080 --> 13:58.640
 And we've had people sort of pen test our systems in really creative ways where they'll

13:58.640 --> 14:03.880
 just fire, programmatically with APIs, they'll fire off a million different quotes and look

14:03.880 --> 14:08.240
 for one of them that's out of bounds and then actually take that money right there.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.400
 We get people doing all kinds of crazy stuff.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.320
 So how do you protect against that?

14:12.320 --> 14:13.400
 How do you protect?

14:13.400 --> 14:18.400
 So we'll talk about cybersecurity in interesting ways, but there's a lot of clever people trying

14:18.400 --> 14:23.920
 to do clever things to earn, not even just to break into the system, but to earn an edge

14:23.920 --> 14:26.360
 of some kind in the system.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.920
 How do you stay one step ahead?

14:28.920 --> 14:29.920
 There's no silver bullet.

14:29.920 --> 14:30.920
 It's a bunch of lead bullets.

14:30.920 --> 14:36.240
 So it's like, one thing we do is we just have good test suites.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.520
 So you're testing every piece of code that goes out.

14:38.520 --> 14:43.920
 That's just common good best practice, but it's particularly important in financial services.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.480
 Another thing we do is we hire third party firms to try to audit this stuff and break

14:47.480 --> 14:48.480
 in.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.360
 Another one we do is we have a bug bounty program.

14:51.360 --> 14:58.200
 So we basically pay white hat hackers to find this stuff before the black hats do and we've

14:58.200 --> 14:59.800
 paid out lots of good bug bounties.

14:59.800 --> 15:04.360
 So try all the above and occasionally you don't get it right and you lose some money

15:04.360 --> 15:06.040
 and then you fix it and you keep going.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.040
 So yeah.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.400
 Let's talk about cybersecurity a little bit more.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.280
 You mentioned using stolen banking accounts.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.280
 So that's another one.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.280
 That's another interesting one.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.640
 How do you protect against that?

15:17.640 --> 15:18.640
 Okay.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.800
 So fraud prevention is a big topic.

15:20.800 --> 15:27.720
 So there's a lot of things people do, but one of the things they do is that use machine

15:27.720 --> 15:28.720
 learning.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.720
 So you look at...

15:29.720 --> 15:31.000
 Protect or to attack.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.480
 To protect against it.

15:32.480 --> 15:38.880
 So what you want to do is kind of build up a labeled data set of all the different people

15:38.880 --> 15:43.760
 who have turned out to be fraudulent and good actors and hopefully collect as much data

15:43.760 --> 15:44.760
 as you can.

15:44.760 --> 15:49.400
 So you might feed hundreds or thousands of these factors into your machine learning model

15:49.400 --> 15:51.720
 and it'll come back with a risk score.

15:51.720 --> 15:56.880
 So an example of the kinds of factors people create or put in there, obviously, I don't

15:56.880 --> 16:01.120
 want to disclose too many of them because it's a cat and mouse game, but just kind of, I

16:01.120 --> 16:05.480
 don't know, relatively well known stuff might be...

16:05.480 --> 16:07.000
 You have device fingerprints.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.400
 So what kind of device are you on and what fonts do you have installed?

16:10.400 --> 16:14.120
 A lot of people who are farming lots of these accounts, they're using emulators and virtual

16:14.120 --> 16:15.320
 machines and stuff.

16:15.320 --> 16:19.240
 They're not an average person on that device.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.280
 And then you'll see sometimes...

16:21.280 --> 16:26.240
 One of my favorite metrics we tracked for this was called improbable travel velocity.

16:26.240 --> 16:33.200
 So we were tracking people's IPs and you might see someone who was one day in Austin, Texas

16:33.200 --> 16:36.760
 and then an hour later, they were in London or something, and it's like, well, that's

16:36.760 --> 16:37.760
 very improbable.

16:37.760 --> 16:41.040
 I mean, sometimes people are using VPNs, so you got to be careful with that because

16:41.040 --> 16:46.280
 there's legitimate people who use VPNs too, but if it's not possible for them, we've gotten

16:46.280 --> 16:49.640
 on a plane and gotten there that quickly, then that's usually they're spoofing a device

16:49.640 --> 16:50.640
 or IP.

16:50.640 --> 16:56.920
 Sometimes those are interesting factors, but yeah, if you feed enough of these in, another

16:56.920 --> 17:04.160
 fun one is real users will type their credit card one number at a time.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.440
 Scammers have a list of them and they'll just paste in a whole number.

17:07.440 --> 17:12.840
 So you can look at the number of milliseconds between keystrokes, there's all kinds of stuff

17:12.840 --> 17:13.840
 people have come up with.

17:13.840 --> 17:19.080
 Even for travel velocity, you could probably incorporate VPNs too because there's probably

17:19.080 --> 17:24.680
 a travel velocity for VPN switching too that's human like.

17:24.680 --> 17:30.200
 If you're using legitimately VPN for something else, that might be, there's like legitimate

17:30.200 --> 17:31.200
 uses too.

17:31.200 --> 17:36.000
 Actually, I feel embarrassed that I don't know this, probably should, but I'm not a

17:36.000 --> 17:37.920
 robot.

17:37.920 --> 17:38.920
 Capture thing.

17:38.920 --> 17:39.920
 Capture thing.

17:39.920 --> 17:40.920
 Yeah.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.040
 So that probably works in the same way.

17:43.040 --> 17:48.920
 How do you move your mouse maybe or how the dynamics of the clicking?

17:48.920 --> 17:49.920
 Totally.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.960
 Well, how does that even work that well then and why can't it be fake?

17:52.960 --> 17:56.920
 I need to look into this because it's such a trivial capture.

17:56.920 --> 18:01.920
 It feels like it should be very crackable and yet a lot of high security places use

18:01.920 --> 18:02.920
 that.

18:02.920 --> 18:03.920
 Yeah.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.920
 It's really interesting.

18:04.920 --> 18:10.400
 Yeah, but it's using a lot of similar signals like mouse movements, keystrokes, and then

18:10.400 --> 18:14.280
 obviously all the stuff that comes over the wire with your browser.

18:14.280 --> 18:21.000
 So like what operating system, what fonts, what headers are being sent over and there's

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
 an old website.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
 I can't remember what it's called.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.320
 It was kind of like Panoptic Click or Panopticon or something, but it basically was like a

18:26.320 --> 18:30.720
 proof of concept site that they would just show you all the data that was kind of getting

18:30.720 --> 18:36.560
 sent over with your request and say that there's only one person in the world who has this

18:36.560 --> 18:37.560
 exact set of data.

18:37.560 --> 18:38.560
 It's you.

18:38.560 --> 18:45.360
 And so it's almost like a clever work around to track somebody, identify a unique person

18:45.360 --> 18:48.080
 even if there wasn't a cookie involved or something.

18:48.080 --> 18:51.400
 Yeah, this is a fascinating world where you can't see anybody.

18:51.400 --> 18:55.080
 You're in the dark and yet you have a lot of signal and you have to figure out who's

18:55.080 --> 18:58.440
 a real person, who's not, who's a robot, who's not.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.440
 Let me step back.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.120
 I'll go around all over the place and step back.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.120
 That's why I like your interviews.

19:02.120 --> 19:05.320
 You get into like technical topics.

19:05.320 --> 19:09.360
 So just let's use Bitcoin as a measure of time.

19:09.360 --> 19:14.520
 You started Coinbase when Bitcoin was $10.

19:14.520 --> 19:20.120
 And you just mentioned an incredible system with security, with transactions, everything

19:20.120 --> 19:21.120
 is thought through.

19:21.120 --> 19:25.800
 There's a lot going on, but what was version one back in those early days, the first prototype

19:25.800 --> 19:26.800
 of Coinbase?

19:26.800 --> 19:27.800
 What did that look like?

19:27.800 --> 19:28.800
 Yeah.

19:28.800 --> 19:36.360
 What did it take to write it, to think through it and make it work enough to at least make

19:36.360 --> 19:37.880
 you believe that it's going to work?

19:37.880 --> 19:40.080
 Well, I definitely didn't know if it was going to work.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.160
 I mean, it was kind of, I felt like I was just following my gut.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.960
 So, I mean, I was working at Airbnb.

19:46.960 --> 19:50.000
 I was a software engineer there, project manager.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.080
 I was working on some fraud prevention stuff, for instance.

19:53.080 --> 19:57.840
 And I read the Bitcoin White Paper in kind of December of 2010.

19:57.840 --> 20:02.120
 I started going to some Bitcoin meetups in the Bay Area, met lots of interesting people

20:02.120 --> 20:07.200
 there, like crazy people, anarchists, like really brilliant people, all the above.

20:07.200 --> 20:11.280
 And so I started nights and weekends trying to put together a prototype.

20:11.280 --> 20:17.200
 And my initial thought was, well, SMTP is a protocol that runs email.

20:17.200 --> 20:23.520
 And Git is a protocol for version control that people made like Gmail and GitHub.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.880
 Most people don't want to run their own email server or even their own Git server.

20:26.880 --> 20:31.760
 They just want to use a hosted thing that will do all the security and backups for them.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.360
 So the thought in my head at that time was, Bitcoin is this new protocol.

20:34.360 --> 20:38.160
 There's probably going to be somebody who makes a hosted service that does all the security

20:38.160 --> 20:42.160
 and backups for you, makes Bitcoin as a protocol easy to use.

20:42.160 --> 20:46.640
 So maybe I should make like a hosted Bitcoin wallet or something.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.520
 That was my, it was going to make Gmail for Bitcoin or something.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.520
 And a bunch of people told me that was a bad idea.

20:53.520 --> 20:58.120
 Most of my smart friends who I told about it, they were like, well, first of all, I don't

20:58.120 --> 20:59.560
 really get what you're doing at all.

20:59.560 --> 21:04.280
 Like Bitcoin sounds like a scam or something you've got, you've gotten involved in.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.560
 But then other people who understood what Bitcoin was told me they thought it was a

21:06.560 --> 21:10.240
 dumb idea because they're like, dude, if you store all this Bitcoin, you're just going

21:10.240 --> 21:11.240
 to get hacked.

21:11.240 --> 21:14.920
 Like nobody, you know, why would you, why would you do that?

21:14.920 --> 21:19.960
 And so I kind of had this thought like, you know what, I'm not going to go all in and

21:19.960 --> 21:21.800
 like make a store everyone's Bitcoin.

21:21.800 --> 21:22.800
 That would be too much right now.

21:22.800 --> 21:23.800
 I have a job.

21:23.800 --> 21:27.320
 I have a day job, you know, but let me just make a prototype and I'll tell people this

21:27.320 --> 21:28.320
 is like a beta thing.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.160
 Like don't put any real money in it and just see if there's interest.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.200
 And if I feel like I'm onto something, maybe I'll go do this as a company because I did,

21:34.200 --> 21:35.960
 I really wanted to be an entrepreneur at that time.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.960
 I was like, I was 29, I was almost turning 30 and I was, I always wanted to like start

21:39.960 --> 21:43.520
 a company, but I was, I was, you know, I wasn't yet.

21:43.520 --> 21:47.680
 I was an employee at a company that was great, but so anyway, I had this prototype.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.240
 I was hacking together nice and weekends.

21:50.240 --> 21:55.680
 I actually wrote a whole Bitcoin node in Ruby, which turned out to be a, maybe a weird decision

21:55.680 --> 21:58.000
 in hindsight because Ruby wasn't the most performant language.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.560
 We've subsequently had to rebuild that many times, but yeah, I had this hosted Bitcoin

22:02.560 --> 22:07.880
 wallet and the thing that I didn't have any users for it, by the way, I applied to Y Combinator

22:07.880 --> 22:11.400
 because I was like, maybe if somebody there writes me a check, this will like make it

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
 feel like a real company.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.400
 And I was trying to find it.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.200
 I was trying to find a co founder at that time unsuccessfully.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.160
 So I was basically just wandering in the desert.

22:18.160 --> 22:22.280
 I had a lot of self doubt about this cause I, I was like, I don't know, all my friends

22:22.280 --> 22:27.440
 don't think this is kind of dumb and maybe Bitcoin is just going to get shut down and

22:27.440 --> 22:29.080
 like, this will all be some stupid thing.

22:29.080 --> 22:33.200
 So there was definitely a feeling of just wandering lost in the desert, lots of self

22:33.200 --> 22:35.200
 doubt.

22:35.200 --> 22:39.120
 Paul Graham and the Y Combinator group kind of wrote me the first check after I went and

22:39.120 --> 22:40.120
 interviewed and stuff.

22:40.120 --> 22:44.080
 And they, they wrote me a check for like 150 K. And that was the first time somebody who

22:44.080 --> 22:47.600
 I really looked up to kind of said, this is, this is worth pursuing.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.880
 Like maybe, maybe you're on to something, maybe you're not, but like, let's at least

22:49.880 --> 22:51.380
 try it.

22:51.380 --> 22:55.760
 And so I, that was kind of what gave me the confidence to quit my job and try it.

22:55.760 --> 23:00.540
 And I'll wrap the story here by saying that like, we, you know, I found the right co

23:00.540 --> 23:03.960
 founder after Y Combinator, we still didn't have any customers.

23:03.960 --> 23:07.960
 The thing that, you know, I basically launched the hosted Bitcoin wallet, there were people

23:07.960 --> 23:08.960
 signing up.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.640
 I just posted on Reddit and places like that.

23:11.640 --> 23:15.040
 And you know, maybe like a hundred people would sign up and then nobody would come back.

23:15.040 --> 23:20.520
 And so I was like, I just, in Y Combinator, they often tell you like, you know, talk to

23:20.520 --> 23:23.240
 your customers and improve your product, talk to your customers, improve your product.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.320
 That's all you're supposed to be doing.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.840
 Try to find product market fit.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.000
 So I emailed like five of the users that had signed up.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.480
 And I was like, Hey, I'm, I worked on this app.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.480
 I saw you signed up.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.480
 Can I get on the phone with you?

23:32.480 --> 23:34.800
 I get on the phone with like five of these folks.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.000
 And I was like, you know, why didn't you come back?

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
 And the guy was like, well, the app was okay for a, for a beta, but like, I don't have

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
 any Bitcoins.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
 So I didn't really know what to do with it.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.280
 And I remember this light bulb kind of went off my head.

23:45.280 --> 23:49.680
 I was like, well, if I put a buy Bitcoin button in there, would you have used it?

23:49.680 --> 23:51.560
 And he was like, yeah, maybe.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.200
 So then I had this, we went about the process.

23:54.200 --> 23:58.120
 My co founder at that time, we like got basically had to get like a bank partnership payment

23:58.120 --> 24:01.200
 rails, you know, an exchange, basic exchange functionality, all that stuff I was mentioning

24:01.200 --> 24:03.640
 earlier in place.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.720
 And the minute we launched that feature where you could just click buy, put in your bank

24:06.720 --> 24:09.680
 counter credit card, buy it by Bitcoin, it showed up in your account.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.720
 From that day forward, like the number of users started to go up like this.

24:12.720 --> 24:17.200
 And so we finally had found product market fit after two years of wandering in the desert.

24:17.200 --> 24:21.040
 So you weren't even thinking about the buy the on ramps, you would think it would be

24:21.040 --> 24:25.760
 just a wall, a place to store Bitcoin that you've already gotten.

24:25.760 --> 24:26.760
 Yeah.

24:26.760 --> 24:27.760
 Okay.

24:27.760 --> 24:33.760
 This is, I mean, because that's such a pain to do to have to work with others to convert

24:33.760 --> 24:37.840
 dollars of any fiat currency into, into Bitcoin.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.840
 Yeah.

24:38.840 --> 24:45.520
 I mean, were you overwhelmed by the immensity of the task here?

24:45.520 --> 24:53.720
 Or were you just sort of not allowing yourself to think too deeply through this whole thing

24:53.720 --> 24:59.080
 and just letting the optimism take over here?

24:59.080 --> 25:03.720
 You know, I was really looking forward to like doing something crazy and like a big challenge.

25:03.720 --> 25:11.960
 And I wanted to, I love kind of crisis moments like that where, you know, I'm very determined,

25:11.960 --> 25:12.960
 right?

25:12.960 --> 25:15.680
 And especially when I get like very set on something and I'm just like, you know what,

25:15.680 --> 25:20.160
 I'm going to figure out a way to make this fucking thing work, like no matter what.

25:20.160 --> 25:23.120
 And so I, I reveled in that.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.880
 I was sort of, I had, I had read all these books about startups and like every startup

25:26.880 --> 25:30.440
 has these like, you know, major setbacks and just like nothing works.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.440
 And so

25:31.440 --> 25:33.400
 So that was a sign that you're doing something right?

25:33.400 --> 25:37.320
 I had no idea if I was doing anything right at all, but I was like, I was kind of loving

25:37.320 --> 25:38.720
 the experience of it in a weird way.

25:38.720 --> 25:44.040
 It felt, it felt stressful at the time, like, you know, nothing was working and, but I was

25:44.040 --> 25:47.280
 just, I felt like I was on the right path somehow.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.280
 And so I just kept going.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.280
 I don't know.

25:49.280 --> 25:55.880
 What was the darkest moment that you've gone to in your mind during that time?

25:55.880 --> 25:58.720
 What was, what were some of the tougher moments?

25:58.720 --> 26:00.600
 You said self doubt.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.600
 Yeah.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.840
 Have you, yeah, where'd you go?

26:04.840 --> 26:06.640
 Where'd you go in your mind?

26:06.640 --> 26:10.520
 Is there a moment where you're just like laying there?

26:10.520 --> 26:12.600
 This is, this is hopeless.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.480
 Well, there's a couple of moments I'm remembering.

26:15.480 --> 26:20.800
 I mean, so for whatever reason, I had this like big chip on my shoulder at that time.

26:20.800 --> 26:24.000
 And I was like, I really want to do something important in the world.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.120
 Like, you know, I could have a good life and like work for some good companies and write

26:28.120 --> 26:29.120
 some software.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.960
 And I'm, for some reason, I never wanted that for myself.

26:31.960 --> 26:35.000
 That probably wouldn't have been healthier, honestly, just to like, that as an expected

26:35.000 --> 26:38.120
 value outcome, that's probably a better thing in life.

26:38.120 --> 26:42.200
 But I was like, I was like, man, I really want to do something important and have a

26:42.200 --> 26:43.200
 bigger impact.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.240
 And I was like, I was willing to sacrifice a lot for that.

26:46.240 --> 26:49.600
 I was like, sleep and not going out with friends and stuff.

26:49.600 --> 26:54.080
 I remember one of the, just for like years working on this stuff, remember one of the

26:54.080 --> 27:00.640
 darker moments was we probably had like maybe five employees at that time.

27:00.640 --> 27:04.640
 And I remember like a bunch of bad things happened like all at once.

27:04.640 --> 27:10.480
 And it was, so first of all, you have to remember at this time, we were all very sleep deprived,

27:10.480 --> 27:11.960
 which kind of exacerbates everything.

27:11.960 --> 27:16.600
 If you look at like the Exxon Valdez spill and all these like natural disasters like sleep

27:16.600 --> 27:18.600
 deprivation is often involved.

27:18.600 --> 27:22.240
 So because the reason why we're so sleep deprived is not just because we're working so much,

27:22.240 --> 27:26.280
 but like the site would go offline in the middle of the night and we'd get, I get paged.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.280
 I was like on pager duty.

27:27.280 --> 27:30.320
 So I'd get woken up sometimes like two or three times a night, like have to try to fix

27:30.320 --> 27:32.040
 something, go back to sleep.

27:32.040 --> 27:37.120
 So in that environment, you can kind of get, you can get discouraged.

27:37.120 --> 27:42.320
 So one bad thing that happened was we had a bug on the website and there was thousands

27:42.320 --> 27:47.000
 of people on Reddit and Twitter who were all like pissed at Coinbase because of like the

27:47.000 --> 27:48.520
 balances were showing wrong.

27:48.520 --> 27:51.080
 And they were just like, you know, fuck this company.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.080
 It's over.

27:52.080 --> 27:56.080
 You know, these guys and so that was, I'd never had this feeling of a thousand people

27:56.080 --> 27:57.320
 mad at me at the same time.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.920
 You know, I feel like I'm a pretty chill guy.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.480
 Like most of the time people don't get mad at me.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.280
 So that was one.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.280
 Another one was that.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.280
 Can we pause on that?

28:04.280 --> 28:05.280
 That's so interesting.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.080
 So you, you were saying like, here's a dream.

28:07.080 --> 28:12.640
 I'm trying to create something and now forever the reputation of this dream is ruined.

28:12.640 --> 28:15.080
 It will never, it's irrecoverable.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.080
 It's over.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.080
 That kind of feeling.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.080
 Yeah.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.080
 Well, I didn't, you're right.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.080
 I didn't know at that time.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.760
 I was like, is this, is this the end?

28:21.760 --> 28:24.240
 Like everybody, we're so, we're so tiny.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.240
 Now everybody hates us.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.240
 So is it over?

28:26.240 --> 28:27.240
 Yeah.

28:27.240 --> 28:32.480
 Um, nobody told me this before starting a company that like your bunch of people will

28:32.480 --> 28:37.640
 hate you for this, which is like a very counterintuitive thing because, you know, if most companies

28:37.640 --> 28:39.800
 I think are doing good things in the world, at least you're trying, right?

28:39.800 --> 28:43.280
 And so even if someone's like trying, but they're not, they're failing, I'm generally

28:43.280 --> 28:44.280
 rooting for them.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.280
 At least you're trying, right?

28:45.280 --> 28:46.280
 Yeah.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.280
 But that's not the case at all.

28:47.280 --> 28:52.560
 Like most founders I've known have gone through this too, where, um, they're very surprised

28:52.560 --> 28:54.240
 at the amount of hate that they get.

28:54.240 --> 28:57.840
 And if it's, I think it's actually like a muscle you can build your tolerance to it.

28:57.840 --> 29:02.480
 Like, because, you know, you go talk to somebody who's like, for you, it feels terrible because

29:02.480 --> 29:03.640
 you're at the center of this storm.

29:03.640 --> 29:07.060
 And like, but if you go, then you go talk to like, you know, your, your family or some

29:07.060 --> 29:09.120
 other person like, dude, I didn't even hear about that.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.400
 Like my, they're just busy in their own life.

29:11.400 --> 29:15.720
 And so they, they have no idea that you had all this negative press or like whatever it

29:15.720 --> 29:16.720
 was.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.240
 Like once again, put a link on that.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.240
 Yeah.

29:20.240 --> 29:26.440
 There's an interesting person I'd like to bring up just as an example, uh, Bill Gates.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.440
 Yeah.

29:27.440 --> 29:31.520
 So he gets a very large amount of hate on the internet.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.520
 Yeah.

29:32.520 --> 29:37.840
 And there's something about him, this is me talking that you that he seems out of touch

29:37.840 --> 29:39.840
 about that hate.

29:39.840 --> 29:46.560
 I, I believe at least in my understanding, the, uh, with the, with the resources he has,

29:46.560 --> 29:50.520
 he's trying and is actually doing a lot of good.

29:50.520 --> 29:54.520
 And yet there's a gigantic amount of hate conspiracy theories and stuff like that.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.520
 Right.

29:55.520 --> 30:02.200
 And it feels like that's the case because he's somehow out of touch with, with people.

30:02.200 --> 30:07.600
 So I wonder how you stay in touch with the voice of the people without being destroyed

30:07.600 --> 30:08.880
 by the outrage.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.080
 Is there, is there any wisdom you have to that?

30:11.080 --> 30:16.560
 I don't know about wisdom, but I've thought about this too, because yeah, you want to

30:16.560 --> 30:21.120
 always be open to feedback, especially from people who have like your best interests at

30:21.120 --> 30:22.120
 heart.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.120
 Right.

30:23.120 --> 30:28.000
 And if you can become isolated from it and just like, you know, surrounded by yes people

30:28.000 --> 30:33.800
 and, um, I mean, who knows, maybe, maybe like she and Putin and people like that are in

30:33.800 --> 30:34.800
 situations.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.800
 I have no idea.

30:35.800 --> 30:40.520
 Um, but if you listen to too much of it and you just try to please everyone, you'll never

30:40.520 --> 30:41.520
 get anything done.

30:41.520 --> 30:48.520
 And I mean, most of the best leaders are people who they can act when they believe that they,

30:48.520 --> 30:51.600
 they're doing something net positive for the world and humanity.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.920
 And they actually don't really care if they piss off some portion of the people, almost

30:55.920 --> 31:00.640
 anything you're going to do of significance in the world today is going to piss off 5%

31:00.640 --> 31:03.960
 of people, maybe, maybe 49% of people or whatever, maybe 60%.

31:03.960 --> 31:04.960
 I don't know.

31:04.960 --> 31:09.320
 So you never want to become so surrounded by people who just work for you and will say

31:09.320 --> 31:10.320
 yes.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.000
 And then you think like, well, I'm a genius and I'm like, I'm a, that's how you become

31:13.000 --> 31:14.480
 a dictator or whatever.

31:14.480 --> 31:18.720
 Um, but you also can't care so much about what people think because then you'll never

31:18.720 --> 31:21.800
 do anything that's truly authentic to yourself.

31:21.800 --> 31:25.200
 One other thought on that, by the way, I think it's a really good question.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.120
 So I've thought about this a lot, like why, you know, people generally kind of hate on

31:29.120 --> 31:35.080
 Zuck and they hate on Bill Gates and they hate on, um, they don't really hate on Elon.

31:35.080 --> 31:37.440
 Actually Elon has a lot of haters too, but it's a different thing.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.520
 This is measured.

31:38.520 --> 31:39.520
 This is measured.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.360
 I was looking some surveys.

31:41.360 --> 31:45.720
 So I think, uh, Zuck is the most so loved and hated, right?

31:45.720 --> 31:46.720
 Yeah.

31:46.720 --> 31:50.960
 Uh, Zuckerberg is the most both, uh, loved and hated.

31:50.960 --> 31:51.960
 He's the most hated.

31:51.960 --> 31:55.240
 And then I think it's Bill Gates and Elon is down there.

31:55.240 --> 32:02.720
 I think it's like, uh, 40% hate Zuck, people asked, and then Elon is in the double digits,

32:02.720 --> 32:03.720
 but low double digits.

32:03.720 --> 32:08.760
 And so it's interesting, you just look at this day and ask yourself, why, right?

32:08.760 --> 32:12.920
 So I asked myself this sometimes too, because I don't claim to know any of these people

32:12.920 --> 32:16.720
 well, but like, I've, I've met them briefly and I, my impression is that they're actually

32:16.720 --> 32:18.840
 all smart people trying to do good things in the world.

32:18.840 --> 32:23.320
 So there's not too much difference there, despite public perception perception.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.440
 So why is it that some are really hated and some aren't?

32:25.440 --> 32:31.200
 I mean, it's a complicated question, um, obviously, you know, Zuck and his Facebook got blamed

32:31.200 --> 32:33.720
 for the whole election thing and all that didn't help.

32:33.720 --> 32:39.320
 Um, social media has gotten a lot of pressure just from like, you know, Hey, why aren't you

32:39.320 --> 32:40.880
 solving all of society's tough problems?

32:40.880 --> 32:42.800
 It's like, well, they're just one company.

32:42.800 --> 32:48.040
 But one thing I've noticed is that, you know, a lot of these people, they're a little, they

32:48.040 --> 32:49.280
 have a like Asperger's, right?

32:49.280 --> 32:50.280
 A little bit.

32:50.280 --> 32:54.800
 Um, sometimes, you know, people with Asperger's don't really emote in the same way.

32:54.800 --> 33:05.120
 And so I think it's almost a form of like, um, um, like bias against, um, their cognitive

33:05.120 --> 33:07.920
 type or something, which is like, that person doesn't emote, right?

33:07.920 --> 33:11.720
 I don't trust their, their, um, intentions.

33:11.720 --> 33:16.960
 And, um, the other thing I've thought about too is that sometimes I think some leaders,

33:16.960 --> 33:20.800
 you know, um, like maybe Zuck or Bill Gates, they can come across as like a little bit

33:20.800 --> 33:23.080
 PR rehearsed.

33:23.080 --> 33:27.480
 Like they're basically, um, they're giving the PR approved answers as where Elon just

33:27.480 --> 33:29.760
 says whatever he thinks, like to a fault.

33:29.760 --> 33:33.320
 So even if people hate what he says, they're like, at least I believe it's authentic.

33:33.320 --> 33:34.920
 So I've always thought about that too for myself.

33:34.920 --> 33:38.520
 I'm like, how do I, cause you can, you can fuck it up on both sides, right?

33:38.520 --> 33:42.320
 Like if you just come out and you're like saying whatever's stream of consciousness,

33:42.320 --> 33:46.120
 you'll often end up like pissing off people on your team or like saying tripping over

33:46.120 --> 33:50.640
 some like regulation that you've, you know, um, there's all kinds of things about running

33:50.640 --> 33:51.640
 a public company.

33:51.640 --> 33:55.880
 You know, you can't say certain stuff, but if you're too PR approved and your answer

33:55.880 --> 33:58.360
 is like, nobody trusts you what you're saying.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.440
 And so anyway, this is something I think about a lot.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.880
 I don't think I have the right answer, but I'm trying to, I'm trying to find that balance.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.400
 And more and more with the internet, there's a premium on authenticity.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.080
 Just like you're saying people really, really appreciate this.

34:09.080 --> 34:15.680
 So for leaders, it's a, it's a challenge to be, how do I, uh, make sure I'm authentic,

34:15.680 --> 34:18.920
 but also, um, don't say stupid shit.

34:18.920 --> 34:19.920
 Yeah.

34:19.920 --> 34:20.920
 And so that's a interesting thing.

34:20.920 --> 34:28.080
 I've noticed that, um, just having interacted with the, with a bunch of leaders that you

34:28.080 --> 34:33.160
 have to be careful how much you surround yourself with PR folks, cause the best I would say,

34:33.160 --> 34:38.800
 let me just say a nice thing about marketing and PR folks, the best marketing folks are

34:38.800 --> 34:40.800
 extremely good.

34:40.800 --> 34:45.000
 So they understand exactly what great marketing is and great PR.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.560
 It's authenticity, it's showing, revealing the beauty as opposed to PR and marketing

34:50.560 --> 34:51.560
 out of fear.

34:51.560 --> 34:52.560
 Oh, don't say that.

34:52.560 --> 34:53.560
 Don't say this.

34:53.560 --> 34:54.640
 Don't say that.

34:54.640 --> 34:58.360
 Because then you, you start living in this kind of, that pushes you towards a bubble

34:58.360 --> 35:03.400
 where you can't express the, your, your beautiful quirks and weirdness and all that kind of stuff.

35:03.400 --> 35:07.120
 And also the cool, the beautiful things about what you're doing.

35:07.120 --> 35:12.800
 I find like, um, especially with the tech thing, like even like Coinbase, the way to

35:12.800 --> 35:19.280
 reveal the beauty of it is not only by showing all the things you could do with it, but showing

35:19.280 --> 35:22.320
 that there's great engineering going on underneath.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.800
 So letting the nerds shine too.

35:23.800 --> 35:31.320
 It doesn't have to be like, uh, these kind of commercials where it's like, uh, a happy

35:31.320 --> 35:37.120
 family using Coinbase to send a transaction about, uh, flowers for mom or something like

35:37.120 --> 35:38.120
 that.

35:38.120 --> 35:41.760
 Like it could be also like gritty stuff and real stuff.

35:41.760 --> 35:46.200
 Um, um, that's a general, just observation I made, but you said, you were talking about

35:46.200 --> 35:50.240
 dark moments and that there's people on the internet that were pissed off that the site

35:50.240 --> 35:51.240
 was down.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.520
 And you said there might be something else.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.520
 Yeah.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.840
 So sleep deprived, like a bunch of people on the internet were pissed at me.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.560
 The balances were fucked up.

35:59.560 --> 36:03.680
 Like people were tweeting the company's over, just give the money back, whatever.

36:03.680 --> 36:07.880
 And then, um, oh yeah, somebody posted.

36:07.880 --> 36:11.160
 So we had all this, we didn't, we had started to get all these customer support inquiries

36:11.160 --> 36:14.280
 and like we only had like a few people at the company.

36:14.280 --> 36:18.560
 And so we were backed up maybe like 20, 20,000 support requests so people couldn't get a

36:18.560 --> 36:19.800
 hold of us.

36:19.800 --> 36:24.240
 So somebody posted my cell phone number on Reddit and they were like, they were like,

36:24.240 --> 36:27.160
 if you need to get a hold of the CEO, whatever, because everyone's upset about where their

36:27.160 --> 36:28.320
 money is.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.080
 So I remember what we're in the office.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.520
 It's like, it's like late at night.

36:31.520 --> 36:34.440
 We've been working like 12 hours or all sleep deprived or I'm trying to, I'm trying to hack

36:34.440 --> 36:38.760
 and like get this bug fixed and we all need like food at the office.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.960
 And so my phone, my phone has been blowing up all day because someone posted my phone

36:41.960 --> 36:46.520
 number on the internet and there's like a guy, um, there was a guy like trying to deliver

36:46.520 --> 36:50.560
 food and I needed to answer my phone to like get the food from downstairs.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.080
 So I was like, shit, I got to just see who, if that's him.

36:53.080 --> 36:56.760
 So I started answering the call and it's, and it's like, is this Brian?

36:56.760 --> 37:00.520
 I'm like, no, wrong number, click, you know, and I, you know, I, the next, I pick up the

37:00.520 --> 37:01.520
 next call.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.040
 It's like every, every, when I finished the call, another call is like coming in.

37:04.040 --> 37:08.480
 So I was like, this, I'm a reporter from Japan, like asking about a security, no, wrong

37:08.480 --> 37:09.480
 number, click.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.080
 And then I like, finally I get the delivery guy downstairs, bring the food up.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.840
 We're all like, you know, surviving to like fix this bug.

37:15.840 --> 37:20.000
 Um, I remember there was just basically a point that night where I was like, fuck, I

37:20.000 --> 37:25.760
 need to just, I basically just curled up on a, on like a ball on the floor and I, I just

37:25.760 --> 37:27.600
 like cried for a little bit.

37:27.600 --> 37:31.960
 Um, I think I let myself just kind of wallow and self pity kind of took a nap for about

37:31.960 --> 37:37.160
 five minutes and I was like, let's fucking solve this and I like, you know, stop being

37:37.160 --> 37:40.600
 like a little whatever and like got back up.

37:40.600 --> 37:44.800
 Deprivation combined with just the stress and the pressure of the site going down and

37:44.800 --> 37:49.600
 everybody wants the site to be up, just the pressure from people and the number of users

37:49.600 --> 37:51.120
 is growing and growing and growing.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.840
 So that pressure was just mentally, mentally tough.

37:53.840 --> 37:54.840
 Yeah.

37:54.840 --> 37:58.400
 What was your source of strength during that time?

37:58.400 --> 38:04.160
 Like what, like, uh, somebody that pat, patting you on the back and said, we got this.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.160
 Yeah.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.920
 Well, it definitely helped to have a co founder.

38:06.920 --> 38:11.680
 So, you know, there's like that old saying about, it's better to be in a great relationship

38:11.680 --> 38:14.080
 than to be single, but it's better to be single than being in a bad relationship.

38:14.080 --> 38:17.440
 So co founders actually blow up a lot of companies too.

38:17.440 --> 38:21.760
 But when you find the right co founder, which I was lucky to find with, with Fred or some,

38:21.760 --> 38:22.760
 that was very important.

38:22.760 --> 38:28.000
 There was definitely moments where, you know, I was like, kind of, you know, at the wit's

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
 end or whatever.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.240
 And he was like, it's like, dude, let's rally like, and he basically carried the team, you

38:33.240 --> 38:35.560
 know, a couple of times, like in really key moments.

38:35.560 --> 38:42.560
 What advice would you give the startup founders about this particular stage, about surviving

38:42.560 --> 38:47.240
 it to the five and through the five employee stage where you were?

38:47.240 --> 38:48.240
 Yeah.

38:48.240 --> 38:53.840
 Well, if your pre product market fit, the best advice that I have from that period is,

38:53.840 --> 38:55.880
 um, action produces information.

38:55.880 --> 39:03.720
 So just, just like keep doing stuff, you know, I remember like, um, Paul, Paul Graham, Paul

39:03.720 --> 39:05.520
 Graham had this great line like that.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.520
 I think that's his line.

39:06.520 --> 39:10.520
 And he was like, startups are like sharks, if they stop swimming, swimming, they die.

39:10.520 --> 39:13.760
 You know, so even if you're like, not sure what to do, like just do anything because

39:13.760 --> 39:16.160
 when you do it, it'll like, it'll produce some information.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.160
 Like people liked it.

39:17.160 --> 39:18.160
 They didn't.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.160
 This was very true for me.

39:19.160 --> 39:24.240
 There was times where I just did something, um, instead of debating it endlessly and like,

39:24.240 --> 39:25.240
 just try it.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.240
 You know, like, all right.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.240
 So we shipped it.

39:27.240 --> 39:30.200
 And like, there was a couple of times where like the minute I shipped it, and I was like,

39:30.200 --> 39:34.520
 I knew, I know we built this wrong, but now I have an idea of what to do next.

39:34.520 --> 39:37.880
 And it wasn't, I only would have had that idea if we'd actually gone through the exercise

39:37.880 --> 39:39.040
 of going to build it.

39:39.040 --> 39:44.000
 It's like my other favorite analogy for this is that you're like at the base of a mountain

39:44.000 --> 39:47.720
 that shrouded in fog and you're looking up at the mountain and you're trying to think

39:47.720 --> 39:49.120
 like, okay, how do I get up there?

39:49.120 --> 39:52.720
 But you can only see like three or four steps ahead because the fog is so thick.

39:52.720 --> 39:56.320
 So you have to just take steps into the unknown.

39:56.320 --> 39:59.800
 And when you take three steps, another three steps will be revealed ahead of you.

39:59.800 --> 40:02.000
 And sometimes you'll end up on some local maximum.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.880
 You don't have to retrace your steps or whatever, but, or come up to a cliff, you know, but

40:07.880 --> 40:14.360
 most people in life don't take the steps into the fog, into the unknown, because it's scary.

40:14.360 --> 40:17.400
 Or they're like, I don't know what if I fail or like, I don't know how that's going to

40:17.400 --> 40:21.240
 work or I might run out of money or I won't be able to get a job after or I don't know,

40:21.240 --> 40:22.240
 whatever reason.

40:22.240 --> 40:26.040
 But that, that is like one of the things that separates I think entrepreneurial people with

40:26.040 --> 40:31.800
 that kind of inclination is that they have sort of a comfort with this risk tolerance,

40:31.800 --> 40:33.960
 but it's actually not really risky if you think about it.

40:33.960 --> 40:39.600
 It's not like, you know, in, at least in most places, like, you know, if you go to, if you

40:39.600 --> 40:42.800
 go do a startup and it fails, like you're going to, you're even more valuable to your

40:42.800 --> 40:44.280
 next employer, right?

40:44.280 --> 40:48.800
 Or you can go raise a seed round, pay yourself a salary, try it for like two years or three

40:48.800 --> 40:49.800
 years.

40:49.800 --> 40:50.800
 If it doesn't work, go get another job.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.360
 It's not like you're, you weren't paying yourself a salary during that time.

40:53.360 --> 40:57.520
 So I think, I think people overestimate the risk of doing a startup and they just never,

40:57.520 --> 41:02.240
 they never start because it seems crazy and all your friends think it's silly.

41:02.240 --> 41:05.720
 Like that's sort of the default nature of every big startup idea.

41:05.720 --> 41:06.920
 It's just basic fear.

41:06.920 --> 41:11.800
 It's the same kind of fear that if you see a, if you're a guy, see a cute girl at a bar,

41:11.800 --> 41:16.280
 it's the fear associated with coming up to her, be like her, asking her, it's like, what's

41:16.280 --> 41:18.280
 the actual risk exactly?

41:18.280 --> 41:19.280
 Right.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.280
 She'll say, I'm no thanks.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.280
 I'm not in.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.280
 No thanks.

41:22.280 --> 41:27.760
 The risk is like that's going to be mentally difficult to deal with rejection.

41:27.760 --> 41:31.080
 So just like it's mentally difficult to deal with failure.

41:31.080 --> 41:34.720
 If you had a bunch of ideas and you were excited about them and you implement them and you

41:34.720 --> 41:40.400
 realize they're not good, that could be difficult to keep pushing through that.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.960
 But I suppose that's life.

41:41.960 --> 41:46.640
 You're supposed to, you know, perseverance through the failures.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.160
 And then the risk is low.

41:48.160 --> 41:51.100
 So that's, and then the whole time through the fog up the mountain, you're looking for

41:51.100 --> 41:52.440
 a product market fit.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.440
 Yeah.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.440
 That's right.

41:54.440 --> 41:56.920
 So you know you have it when the usage of your product keeps growing without any marketing

41:56.920 --> 41:57.920
 dollars or anything like that.

41:57.920 --> 42:01.240
 And it's just like more people keep coming back every week or month.

42:01.240 --> 42:04.640
 So you're kind of keep, you're basically watching your stats.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.880
 Nothing is working.

42:05.880 --> 42:10.080
 You see these little wiggles of false hope in your metrics and you basically just keep

42:10.080 --> 42:13.560
 talking to customers, fixing the, improving the product, talk to customers, improve the

42:13.560 --> 42:17.160
 product, talk to customers, improve the product, you know, and try not to run out of money.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.360
 So be really scrappy.

42:19.360 --> 42:23.240
 And then if you're lucky, you hit some kind of threshold, we're like, okay, the thing

42:23.240 --> 42:27.200
 is good enough now, or we hit on some use case and then it'll organically start to grow

42:27.200 --> 42:28.480
 a bit.

42:28.480 --> 42:31.400
 And then, then you have a whole different set of problems once you hit product market

42:31.400 --> 42:34.280
 fit, which is how do we scale this thing?

42:34.280 --> 42:35.840
 How do we hire people?

42:35.840 --> 42:40.640
 How do we, you know, hire an executive team or raise more money and like, so the problems

42:40.640 --> 42:41.640
 totally change.

42:41.640 --> 42:45.160
 But you're there through the whole thing.

42:45.160 --> 42:48.560
 So that's the other question that's fascinating.

42:48.560 --> 42:52.280
 Going back to the girl at the bar, how do you hire people?

42:52.280 --> 42:55.440
 It's like, how do you find good friends?

42:55.440 --> 42:58.080
 How do you find good relationships?

42:58.080 --> 43:04.400
 And in this specific case, how do you hire good people, engineers, executive, all of

43:04.400 --> 43:05.400
 it?

43:05.400 --> 43:07.320
 One thing is I've done a lot of reps on hiring at this point.

43:07.320 --> 43:14.720
 So Coinbase has about 5,000 people, probably the first 500 people or something maybe in

43:14.720 --> 43:15.720
 that range.

43:15.720 --> 43:19.680
 You know, I interviewed every single one of those, but you have to remember there's probably

43:19.680 --> 43:24.480
 like, I don't know, on average, maybe 10 people that we went in the process for every one

43:24.480 --> 43:25.480
 we hired or something.

43:25.480 --> 43:30.800
 So it was like, by the time that we had 500 employees, I had done like 5,000 interviews

43:30.800 --> 43:31.800
 or something.

43:31.800 --> 43:32.840
 I was like very burned out at interviews.

43:32.840 --> 43:39.040
 I had been doing, some days I did like seven interviews in a day or maybe, you know, you

43:39.040 --> 43:42.640
 would do lots of interviews, maybe you wouldn't get burned out, but different kind of interviews.

43:42.640 --> 43:43.640
 Very different.

43:43.640 --> 43:44.640
 Very different.

43:44.640 --> 43:45.640
 Yeah.

43:45.640 --> 43:46.640
 Very different.

43:46.640 --> 43:54.280
 So first of all, most of your interviews lead to rejection, which is also exhausting.

43:54.280 --> 43:55.280
 Yeah.

43:55.280 --> 43:59.480
 And there's a whole part of the interview, which is about candidate experience, right?

43:59.480 --> 44:01.960
 Sometimes you know it's not the right person, but you want to make sure they have a good

44:01.960 --> 44:02.960
 experience.

44:02.960 --> 44:03.960
 Yes.

44:03.960 --> 44:06.400
 If you're just exhausted and you're on your sixth interview and you're like, well, thanks

44:06.400 --> 44:10.040
 for coming in and you rap and you're just, and then like, you're going to create a detractor.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.760
 Someone who's out there like, fuck that company or Brian was rude to me or whatever.

44:12.760 --> 44:15.760
 So I had to, honestly, I had to work on that a little bit in the early days because I was

44:15.760 --> 44:16.760
 doing so many interviews.

44:16.760 --> 44:21.640
 Like I needed to make sure that when people came in, I was like, you know, made them feel

44:21.640 --> 44:22.640
 comfortable.

44:22.640 --> 44:27.120
 I asked them a couple of like warm up questions, just like, oh, how was it getting in the office?

44:27.120 --> 44:28.120
 Like, did you find it okay?

44:28.120 --> 44:29.320
 And like, what have you been up to this week?

44:29.320 --> 44:33.760
 And not just like, you know, like a factory assembly line, like boom, boom, boom, boom.

44:33.760 --> 44:34.760
 Like, yeah.

44:34.760 --> 44:38.240
 But also there's a moment, because I've interviewed a bunch of people for like teams and stuff.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.240
 Yeah.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.440
 There's also a moment when you early on know this is not going to be a good fit.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.440
 Yeah.

44:43.440 --> 44:46.920
 And you still have to land that plane and all that kind of stuff.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.440
 And that could get really, really, really exhausting.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.440
 So yeah.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.440
 Anyway, sorry.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.440
 Yeah.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.600
 So basically we've tried so many things over the years to make interviews more efficient

44:55.600 --> 44:59.000
 because it's a huge time sink for the team.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.280
 So, you know, we basically, we'll usually get them down to like 25 minutes.

45:03.280 --> 45:08.920
 I've seen, if you're trying to hire like a big team, let's say, you know, of people

45:08.920 --> 45:11.520
 who are like contractors or something, not necessarily full time employees, I've seen

45:11.520 --> 45:14.360
 people actually do 10 minute interviews.

45:14.360 --> 45:17.680
 You can even interview like a thousand people almost like in a week or something.

45:17.680 --> 45:21.000
 I'm not sure if that quite works out, but let me listen to that.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.840
 But you can basically get six and six down an hour if you're just, I need to get a team

45:24.840 --> 45:26.560
 of 30 contractors for whatever purpose.

45:26.560 --> 45:31.360
 But if you're talking about full time employees, I usually do like 25 minute, you know, you're

45:31.360 --> 45:37.400
 oftentimes like one thing we've done is we'll put like a, like a Google form online and

45:37.400 --> 45:43.120
 it's like put some basic hurdles in there, like, you know, ask them to put in an answer,

45:43.120 --> 45:45.240
 which you can check in a spreadsheet if it was correct or not.

45:45.240 --> 45:48.360
 And like, there were some funny examples in early days of Coinbase where we put in like

45:48.360 --> 45:50.520
 brain teasers and stuff, but we don't do that anymore.

45:50.520 --> 45:52.880
 We do like normal interviews, we do references.

45:52.880 --> 45:58.560
 The kinds of things I ask in interviews, you know, it's usually like, I like to think

45:58.560 --> 46:03.320
 about what, what do we need this person to accomplish in this role, right?

46:03.320 --> 46:05.320
 And get really specific about that.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.240
 It's like usually something pretty hard.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.560
 And then I'll ask them a question.

46:08.560 --> 46:14.880
 It's like, tell me about a time you did X and, or tell me about the hardest, the hardest

46:14.880 --> 46:19.280
 kind of problem you've had to solve in Y and what did you do specifically to overcome

46:19.280 --> 46:20.280
 it?

46:20.280 --> 46:21.280
 Right.

46:21.280 --> 46:23.280
 So I'm asking to see if they can actually do the stuff we need to get done.

46:23.280 --> 46:27.520
 But then I'm also kind of asking like culture questions if I'm interviewing for that.

46:27.520 --> 46:30.920
 And so I'm trying to see like, are they concise communicators?

46:30.920 --> 46:34.520
 Can they just give me a clear answer and stop talking?

46:34.520 --> 46:38.840
 Some people like ramble on for like five, 10 minutes if you ask the first question.

46:38.840 --> 46:42.240
 Some people are, you know, they're interrupter, like church of interruptions.

46:42.240 --> 46:46.320
 So like they won't stop talking until you interrupt them, which for me, I'm always patient

46:46.320 --> 46:47.320
 and I wait.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.320
 So that's weird.

46:49.320 --> 46:50.840
 I'm looking to see for humility too.

46:50.840 --> 46:55.080
 Like, you know, I'll tell, I'll ask people, tell me about a time something went really

46:55.080 --> 46:56.080
 wrong.

46:56.080 --> 47:00.240
 Like you had conflict with someone on a team or, and what I'm kind of looking for is,

47:00.240 --> 47:03.680
 were they part of the solution or are they still holding on to like blame and criticism

47:03.680 --> 47:06.760
 about that and be like, well, I told them they shouldn't do that way, but they didn't

47:06.760 --> 47:07.760
 listen to me.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.520
 You know, these are all like bad signs.

47:09.520 --> 47:12.000
 So I'm looking for, yeah, can they get the job done?

47:12.000 --> 47:13.720
 Will they work together on a team?

47:13.720 --> 47:15.800
 Can they communicate effectively?

47:15.800 --> 47:18.720
 Do they fit into our cultural values and, you know, those kind of things.

47:18.720 --> 47:19.720
 Yeah.

47:19.720 --> 47:24.480
 I mean, there's a, because I have even, even for help with this, this podcast here, but

47:24.480 --> 47:27.560
 also at MIT and so on, I've done a bunch of hiring.

47:27.560 --> 47:31.920
 And I was always looking for, you said brain teasers, all kinds of simple questions that

47:31.920 --> 47:35.720
 can, that can reveal a lot of information.

47:35.720 --> 47:36.880
 And it's always been challenging.

47:36.880 --> 47:43.000
 I used to, I still ask this question, but do you think it's better to work hard or work

47:43.000 --> 47:45.960
 smart?

47:45.960 --> 47:55.960
 And you know, I had this idea that I've, that I think I've matured about, which is I kind

47:55.960 --> 48:03.400
 of believe that people who say work smart on that question don't actually work smart.

48:03.400 --> 48:08.080
 So the right textbook answer is work, it's better to work smart.

48:08.080 --> 48:14.080
 But the reality is it's, it's people that haven't actually ever done anything that say

48:14.080 --> 48:15.080
 work smart.

48:15.080 --> 48:20.760
 They're like, they haven't really struggled because my general belief at the time was

48:20.760 --> 48:27.640
 in order to discover what it means to work smart, to be efficient to, you have to work

48:27.640 --> 48:28.640
 your ass off.

48:28.640 --> 48:33.520
 So you have to really fail a lot and failure feels like hard work.

48:33.520 --> 48:37.560
 And so I was always suspicious of people that would say work smart.

48:37.560 --> 48:41.440
 I would want to interrogate that question.

48:41.440 --> 48:49.360
 But then I also, you know, have, have learned that there is people that are just exceptionally,

48:49.360 --> 48:51.400
 exceptionally efficient.

48:51.400 --> 48:55.800
 They really do know what it means to work smart, even at a young age.

48:55.800 --> 49:00.440
 And so like, you can't just disqualify based on that, you have to dig in deeper.

49:00.440 --> 49:05.320
 But some of the most interesting people I've ever worked with would say work hard, unapologetically.

49:05.320 --> 49:09.880
 And they're usually the ones that know how to be efficient, which is, it's just an interesting

49:09.880 --> 49:11.400
 thing like that.

49:11.400 --> 49:18.640
 And I've always searched for questions of that nature to see, can I, can I get, can I

49:18.640 --> 49:27.080
 get a person to reveal something profound about them in as brief of a question as possible?

49:27.080 --> 49:31.400
 And I, you know, and then of course there's basic attention to detail and brain teasers

49:31.400 --> 49:35.960
 and stuff like that, depending on the role, programming and so on to see, can they, can

49:35.960 --> 49:39.160
 they solve a tricky puzzle and do so?

49:39.160 --> 49:46.360
 Like one that doesn't require a lot of effort, but requires a certain nonlinear way of thinking.

49:46.360 --> 49:51.000
 Is there, is there some, I mean, maybe you don't want to reveal, but is there some questions

49:51.000 --> 49:54.400
 that you sometimes find yourself leaning on?

49:54.400 --> 50:01.480
 You said like, how did you solve a hard problem in your past and have them talk through it?

50:01.480 --> 50:02.480
 That's one.

50:02.480 --> 50:06.600
 You know, we started with brain teasers periodically at Coinbase and I, we got, we got away from

50:06.600 --> 50:07.600
 that relatively quickly.

50:07.600 --> 50:15.160
 And I think one, it's a tough one because I actually think it does show how somebody

50:15.160 --> 50:18.560
 kind of performs under pressure, but it's, I don't think it's a super reliable indicator

50:18.560 --> 50:25.480
 because there's some people who are really good in the typical work situation, but that's

50:25.480 --> 50:28.520
 not a typical work situation where somebody puts you on the spot, like in a live interview

50:28.520 --> 50:31.680
 and sometimes people get nervous and they can't think clearly and like they don't have

50:31.680 --> 50:35.840
 their computer in front of them or whatever they normally use.

50:35.840 --> 50:42.400
 So yeah, I'm a little skeptical now of the brain teaser thing.

50:42.400 --> 50:47.680
 There is a whole, yeah, there is a whole question about like a lot of universities are getting

50:47.680 --> 50:49.000
 rid of, you know, entrance exams.

50:49.000 --> 50:54.560
 So if you're hiring right out of universities, sometimes it's becoming a less reliable indicator

50:54.560 --> 50:56.600
 of like, are they in that university?

50:56.600 --> 50:59.160
 And I've heard some companies, we haven't done this yet, but I've heard some companies

50:59.160 --> 51:05.680
 are actually creating their own like for college grads, like their own basically exams like

51:05.680 --> 51:10.160
 standardized testing, almost to get people in the door because the degree almost doesn't

51:10.160 --> 51:13.560
 mean what it used to, which is the whole topic, but yeah.

51:13.560 --> 51:18.840
 That's fascinating because it's fascinating both for them because it's not just about

51:18.840 --> 51:22.920
 you trying to hire a great team, it's also to help them find the right place to work

51:22.920 --> 51:23.920
 at.

51:23.920 --> 51:24.920
 Yeah.

51:24.920 --> 51:28.200
 It's like a two way street.

51:28.200 --> 51:29.200
 All right.

51:29.200 --> 51:37.040
 So once you found the product market fit, how did Coinbase become what it is today?

51:37.040 --> 51:48.040
 Let me ask him an engineering question actually, sort of from the Ruby wallet days.

51:48.040 --> 51:53.520
 What are some of the interesting challenges there, or are they not engineering?

51:53.520 --> 52:04.240
 The things that had to be solved, what were they, engineering, regulation, financial hiring,

52:04.240 --> 52:07.840
 lawyers, what was it?

52:07.840 --> 52:11.560
 So post product market fit, yeah, a lot of it's scaling and you got to build out an

52:11.560 --> 52:12.560
 actual company.

52:12.560 --> 52:16.880
 So I remember, I was still writing a lot of code there for a while and we were hiring

52:16.880 --> 52:20.640
 in, we had like maybe 25 people or something, and remember one of our investors came by

52:20.640 --> 52:24.240
 one day and he was like, Brian, how much of your time are you spending writing code?

52:24.240 --> 52:28.960
 And I was like, maybe, maybe 50% or something, he was like, how much time are you spending

52:28.960 --> 52:29.960
 hiring people?

52:29.960 --> 52:35.800
 Probably 20%, he was like, I think you need to flip those numbers, like this company's

52:35.800 --> 52:39.480
 not going to scale, you're the CEO, you don't need to be writing code every day, you're

52:39.480 --> 52:42.600
 going to have to transition that stuff, like even if people can't, all that stuff's locked

52:42.600 --> 52:46.080
 in your head, so maybe they're not going to do it as well as you for the first six months

52:46.080 --> 52:48.920
 or something, but like, if you don't start to transition it, you're never going to build

52:48.920 --> 52:52.720
 a real company, it's just going to be, you're going to be the bottleneck.

52:52.720 --> 52:56.800
 So you know, like a lot of founders, that took me a while to like really internalize

52:56.800 --> 52:57.800
 that lesson.

52:57.800 --> 53:02.840
 They'll say that and you know, but I still was holding on too much to decision making

53:02.840 --> 53:07.280
 and I probably still am, by the way, like even to this day at Coinbase where we continually

53:07.280 --> 53:11.000
 have to push down decision making in the org, like even with 5,000 people, like who are

53:11.000 --> 53:12.280
 the owners of each of these things?

53:12.280 --> 53:17.680
 And so the temptation is people to push it up and you become a bottleneck and anyway.

53:17.680 --> 53:21.520
 So yeah, you basically need to make sure you have enough money where you don't die if there's

53:21.520 --> 53:25.240
 in some kind of a downturn or hit break even profitability.

53:25.240 --> 53:28.680
 We were in a position where we were periodically profitable during up periods, but then crypto

53:28.680 --> 53:30.640
 would go down and we were unprofitable.

53:30.640 --> 53:35.040
 And so we had to kind of manage our own psychology and the balance sheet to make sure we didn't

53:35.040 --> 53:38.960
 like die in the downturn, which a lot of crypto companies did.

53:38.960 --> 53:42.960
 We had to basically professionalize a whole bunch of services that had been just very

53:42.960 --> 53:46.120
 quickly thrown together by like 20 year olds, right?

53:46.120 --> 53:49.440
 Whether that was cybersecurity, it's like, okay, how do you get like a really senior

53:49.440 --> 53:52.880
 experienced cyber security person, but not someone who's so senior that they can't get

53:52.880 --> 53:56.440
 their hands dirty and they can come into a company with 25, 50 people?

53:56.440 --> 53:58.120
 How do you get a finance person to come in and do that?

53:58.120 --> 54:02.120
 Our finances were a mess, like we didn't even really know how much money we had at certain

54:02.120 --> 54:03.120
 times and stuff.

54:03.120 --> 54:05.680
 I mean, this was embarrassing to say, but it was true.

54:05.680 --> 54:11.520
 Like I remember there was a point where we had raised, I think like our series C or something

54:11.520 --> 54:12.520
 like that.

54:12.520 --> 54:16.760
 And I think we had our bank accounts and I just put like $25 million like in a different

54:16.760 --> 54:20.160
 bank account that none of this stuff was touched the actual operation of business because

54:20.160 --> 54:24.760
 I was like, you know, our operations were so messy and we needed to hire a new finance

54:24.760 --> 54:25.760
 person.

54:25.760 --> 54:29.520
 And I was like, this, I had heard horror stories of actually startups where they thought they

54:29.520 --> 54:33.600
 had X amount of money and then it turned out they had way less and then the whole thing

54:33.600 --> 54:35.000
 was in solvent in like three weeks.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.360
 So you wanted to have some padding till it was like, all right, I can at least count

54:38.360 --> 54:41.360
 on this to save us if we go like super negative.

54:41.360 --> 54:42.360
 Right.

54:42.360 --> 54:47.000
 I mean, it was like a cheap hack, but that was like, come up with and you know, until

54:47.000 --> 54:51.960
 we could hire like a real fine CFO and finance team who like, okay, now we got our arms around

54:51.960 --> 54:52.960
 how much cash we have.

54:52.960 --> 54:57.440
 It sounds silly, but we had such high volume of money coming in and out anyway.

54:57.440 --> 55:03.400
 What was the ordering of hiring, by the way, like, how many engineers was it early on?

55:03.400 --> 55:06.640
 You said CFO was not, you didn't even have a CFO for a bit.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.640
 Yeah.

55:07.640 --> 55:13.440
 Like what was the, the landscape of hiring as you're building up this company?

55:13.440 --> 55:15.400
 Was it engineering focused?

55:15.400 --> 55:16.400
 Well, let's see.

55:16.400 --> 55:19.840
 The first person we hired was just like, we need, we need to solve customer support.

55:19.840 --> 55:22.440
 So we brought someone to do that because we were all staying up till midnight every night

55:22.440 --> 55:23.920
 trying to do customer support.

55:23.920 --> 55:28.240
 And then we got more engineers and then I think maybe the sixth hire or something like

55:28.240 --> 55:32.120
 that was a recruiter because that, that turned out to be, you need, you need to build hire

55:32.120 --> 55:34.520
 the person who can hire more people.

55:34.520 --> 55:37.280
 That turned out to be a great force multiplier.

55:37.280 --> 55:43.720
 And then you go on down the list, you eventually want to hire some more senior people.

55:43.720 --> 55:45.260
 We needed legal and compliance.

55:45.260 --> 55:48.480
 We needed that really badly because we, you know, it was all kinds of questions about

55:48.480 --> 55:50.480
 what the legality of it was.

55:50.480 --> 55:55.040
 Was it hard to find legal people that work with crypto like serious adults?

55:55.040 --> 55:57.160
 Because it's such a cutting edge new world.

55:57.160 --> 55:58.160
 Yeah.

55:58.160 --> 56:02.080
 I mean, there was nobody who had like more than, nobody had three years of experience

56:02.080 --> 56:04.200
 with it because it had only been around a year.

56:04.200 --> 56:07.400
 So yeah, we were finding people from adjacent fields.

56:07.400 --> 56:10.640
 There's a certain personality type of people who are willing to join early companies because

56:10.640 --> 56:12.640
 they have no structure.

56:12.640 --> 56:16.680
 You can't really commit to them about you're going to have this team or this boss or whatever.

56:16.680 --> 56:19.000
 Like everything's in chaos and flux.

56:19.000 --> 56:23.240
 So it takes, yeah, hiring is one of the hardest things in the early stage for sure.

56:23.240 --> 56:26.280
 You got to find people crazy enough to join you on this journey.

56:26.280 --> 56:29.560
 So one of the interesting things about Coinbase and you've written, we've talked, we'll talk

56:29.560 --> 56:31.400
 about it a bit.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.280
 You're very focused on the mission.

56:33.280 --> 56:34.280
 Yeah.

56:34.280 --> 56:35.280
 Yeah.

56:35.280 --> 56:40.760
 You're very kind of, I think that simplifies things that makes, that makes hiring easier,

56:40.760 --> 56:45.600
 that makes working at Coinbase easier, that makes, I mean, it's similar sort of Elon

56:45.600 --> 56:46.600
 has the same thing.

56:46.600 --> 56:47.600
 It's pretty clear.

56:47.600 --> 56:50.600
 It's pretty clear what we're here to do.

56:50.600 --> 56:54.760
 So I suppose what's the mission of Coinbase?

56:54.760 --> 56:57.960
 Well, it's to increase economic freedom in the world.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.480
 And what is economic freedom?

56:59.480 --> 57:00.480
 Yeah.

57:00.480 --> 57:04.560
 So economic freedom is this term kind of like GDP that economists use and it's basically

57:04.560 --> 57:06.320
 a measure of different countries around the world.

57:06.320 --> 57:11.000
 It looks at things like, are there property rights enforced, is there free trade, is the

57:11.000 --> 57:14.840
 currency stable, can you start companies that you want to start and can you join the ones

57:14.840 --> 57:15.840
 you want to join?

57:15.840 --> 57:20.840
 And, you know, is there corruption and bribery prevalent or is it relatively free of that?

57:20.840 --> 57:26.360
 And so this, there's several different organizations that basically score countries by economic

57:26.360 --> 57:27.360
 freedom.

57:27.360 --> 57:31.720
 And the really cool thing about economic freedom is that basically it positively correlates

57:31.720 --> 57:33.480
 with things that we all want in society.

57:33.480 --> 57:38.760
 Like not only higher growth of the economy, but also things like higher self reported

57:38.760 --> 57:42.800
 happiness of citizens, better treatment of the environment, better income for the poorest

57:42.800 --> 57:43.800
 10% of people.

57:43.800 --> 57:47.960
 And it negatively correlates with things we don't want in society like corruption and

57:47.960 --> 57:50.560
 bribery and war, even in things like that.

57:50.560 --> 57:57.520
 And so it's this pretty, pretty crazy provocative idea, which is that if you give people good

57:57.520 --> 58:02.280
 property rights and rule of law and allow them to trade, it basically encourages them

58:02.280 --> 58:05.320
 to do more good stuff and the whole society benefits.

58:05.320 --> 58:09.200
 Like one of the things, you know, you may have noticed this growing up in various places

58:09.200 --> 58:12.480
 you did or, you know, I spent a year living in Buenos Aires, Argentina that went through

58:12.480 --> 58:13.480
 hyperinflation.

58:13.480 --> 58:20.280
 And there's a certain like pessimism that can creep into countries when they don't have

58:20.280 --> 58:24.040
 economic freedom, which it's basically like everyone has this bit of this vibe, which

58:24.040 --> 58:28.160
 is like, don't stick your head up, you know, don't try too hard because it could all be

58:28.160 --> 58:29.160
 gone tomorrow.

58:29.160 --> 58:33.160
 Like the things that really are valuable in life are just family and friends and the past

58:33.160 --> 58:35.520
 was better than the future will be.

58:35.520 --> 58:39.640
 And so you don't really, people don't try as many, they don't try hard because you're

58:39.640 --> 58:43.520
 not really sure you can actually keep the upside of your labor if you, if you try hard.

58:43.520 --> 58:48.560
 So you just don't try as hard, whereas in America historically, you know, or high economic

58:48.560 --> 58:53.880
 freedom countries, you know, people basically like, they just try more stuff because they're

58:53.880 --> 58:57.160
 like, if I do good for other people, I'll get to keep part of it for myself and I can

58:57.160 --> 59:00.680
 improve my lot in life and for my children and my community, whatever.

59:00.680 --> 59:06.240
 So I realized when I read the Bitcoin white paper a long time ago that at least I had

59:06.240 --> 59:10.000
 a hunch at the time I was like, this might be a really powerful piece of technology that

59:10.000 --> 59:14.840
 can inject good financial infrastructure into all these countries around the world that

59:14.840 --> 59:16.200
 don't have it.

59:16.200 --> 59:19.840
 Basically good economic freedom principles in like, you know, property rights and things

59:19.840 --> 59:23.520
 like that into these countries all over the world with just as long as you had a smartphone

59:23.520 --> 59:27.760
 and now crypto got invented, we could, everybody could have economic freedom and it's crypto

59:27.760 --> 59:31.880
 is kind of really well suited for economic freedom because if you want property rights,

59:31.880 --> 59:36.440
 it's basically crypto is, if you can remember a 12 word phrase or, you know, have an app

59:36.440 --> 59:39.640
 on your phone, you can store as much wealth as you want and it can't be taken away from

59:39.640 --> 59:40.640
 you.

59:40.640 --> 59:43.840
 You can even, you know, there's like refugees who need to flee and they want to take their

59:43.840 --> 59:47.560
 wealth with them and they can't do it often in the traditional financial system.

59:47.560 --> 59:50.080
 And so crypto lets them do that, right?

59:50.080 --> 59:54.960
 crypto is inherently global, so it allows free trade and cross border payments.

59:54.960 --> 59:58.600
 It makes it easy to accept payments from people globally, you know, it's, it provides a stable

59:58.600 --> 1:00:03.200
 currency to everyone, not only with Bitcoin, which is kind of like this new reserve currency,

1:00:03.200 --> 1:00:08.280
 but also with stable coins, right, which are, you know, new, new inventions there.

1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:13.240
 So yeah, I basically feel like crypto is, is this secret hiding in plain sight that

1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:17.360
 can create economic freedom for people all over the world and a more fair and free and

1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:18.640
 global economy.

1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:24.960
 Well, so the limit, and by the way, I didn't know about Argentina, why'd you end up in

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:25.960
 Argentina?

1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:30.240
 Okay, so I was basically, you know, I was living in Houston, Texas after college where

1:00:30.240 --> 1:00:34.240
 I went to school and I had never studied abroad.

1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:37.760
 I kind of like, I don't know, I feel like I needed some adventure or something in my

1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:41.480
 life and I was like, I was running this other startup that I was trying at the time, a tutoring

1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:43.840
 company and I could, I could work from anywhere.

1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:48.040
 So my plan was, you know what, I'm just going to go do like a month in every city around

1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:52.320
 South America, just be like, I almost like to force myself out of my comfort zone because

1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:56.560
 I, I had never traveled by myself to foreign country or whatever and where I didn't really

1:00:56.560 --> 1:01:01.320
 speak the language and anyway, I landed in Buenos Aires thinking I'd go all around South

1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:03.320
 America where I had never been there.

1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:07.560
 But I basically, once I was set up in South, in Buenos Aires with an apartment and a cell

1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:10.320
 phone and stuff, then I was like, I don't want to do that all again next month.

1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:12.520
 So I just stayed there for most of the time and took some day trips.

1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:15.920
 But, but yeah, it was kind of a formative experience in that regard.

1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:21.480
 You got a chance sort of unexpectedly to experience the, the social effects of hyperinflation,

1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:22.480
 which is interesting.

1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:26.080
 But I also, I've never, I've never been, I really, really want to go as a person who

1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:33.840
 likes tangos, a person who likes the Argentinian national team and soccer and, and, and steak.

1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:35.840
 All right.

1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:38.240
 And all the other things that Argentina is known for.

1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:39.240
 Okay.

1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:45.200
 So economic freedom, one of the limits on economic freedom comes from government and

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:49.400
 government regulations and all those kinds of things throughout the world.

1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:51.800
 So how does cryptocurrency help resist that?

1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:57.440
 So can you sort of elaborate a little bit further, what are the things that limit economic

1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:02.400
 freedom and how does crypto help ease that?

1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:06.480
 You know, today the world, like the traditional financial system is basically every country

1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:10.320
 of the world for the most part has their own currency.

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:14.680
 And so there's a group of people or institutions in each of those countries that's controlling

1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:19.000
 that economic policy or that money supply.

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.480
 And you know, it can be, it can be manipulated, right?

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:26.840
 So it's not like many of these currencies are not linked to the gold standard, you know,

1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:29.840
 the US kind of famously came off that in the 1970s, for instance.

1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:33.720
 But if you read Ray Dalio and all this stuff that he talks about, there's thousands of

1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:37.040
 fiat currencies that have been in existence over time.

1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:43.760
 And basically all of them eventually get disconnected from backing of like hard commodities.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:46.520
 And then they get over inflated and print it.

1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:52.800
 And so in times of stress, you know, with Nixon, I guess it was like in the US, it was

1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:54.960
 the Vietnam War or something like that.

1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:56.320
 It kind of drove government spending.

1:02:56.320 --> 1:02:59.120
 And so under times of stress, they say, hey, it's a temporary measure.

1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:01.120
 We need to break the peg.

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:07.480
 Temporary was like, you know, famous words that he used and they go like they go print.

1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:11.840
 And so the bad thing about that, of course, is that it sort of erodes people's like wealth

1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:15.760
 if they can only hold their assets in cash, which basically like poor people tend to do

1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:16.760
 that.

1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:20.600
 You know, if you're wealthy, you can hold stocks or like real estate and things like

1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:21.600
 that.

1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:24.800
 But it's a really a tax on the poorest people in society, inflation.

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:30.320
 So anyway, crypto in a way is a little bit of like a return to the gold standard in this

1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:31.560
 digital era, right?

1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:33.840
 Bitcoin, there's guaranteed scarcity of it.

1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:34.840
 It's deflationary.

1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:37.480
 There's never going to be more than 21 million Bitcoin.

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:42.240
 And so that's, that's a really important principle.

1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:47.280
 I also think big, you know, not just Bitcoin, but like cryptocurrency generally, it's really

1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:50.760
 important in terms of this, you asked about regulation, right?

1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:56.080
 So think about like, if you wanted to make a global borrowing and lending marketplace

1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:02.120
 or a global exchange, you would have to go to all 200 countries in the world, sometimes

1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:09.320
 like maybe 50 States in the US and get lending licenses or an operating exchange or whatever.

1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:13.360
 And you know, they're not going to, it's just an incredible amount of work and you can't

1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:16.800
 even do business in many of these countries because like, you know, you have to bribe

1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:18.920
 somebody or it's corrupt or whatever.

1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:24.200
 And so, but with DeFi, with decentralized finance, people have published, you know,

1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:26.560
 like Uniswap is a decentralized exchange.

1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:30.280
 Everybody in the world, no matter what country you're in, what jurisdiction can, can interface

1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:35.880
 with that decentralized exchange because it, and there's no central company operating it.

1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:40.200
 It's, it's a, it's a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, which is globally decentralized.

1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:41.280
 So there's no throat to choke.

1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:44.720
 There's no one person you can, or a company you can go to to like, hey, shut this thing

1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:45.720
 down.

1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:50.360
 Even if everybody who's working on Uniswap today stopped, the Uniswap smart contract

1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:54.800
 would continue to operate on the Ethereum blockchain.

1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:59.280
 Similarly for like a borrowing and lending marketplace, you know, like it's, you know,

1:04:59.280 --> 1:05:02.320
 if you want, somebody in India wants to borrow from somebody in the US or whatever, like

1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:06.360
 there's very difficult to do that in the traditional financial world.

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:10.680
 But in a smart contract that's decentralized, you can enable anybody to access it.

1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:16.200
 So it's, it's really kind of this great democratizing force that is creating a new financial system

1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:18.400
 that is more fair and more free.

1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:19.400
 Yeah.

1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:27.080
 And in some ways it is, it's a, it's a clever way that's not, you know, it's, it's enabling

1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:28.440
 people to do that in a novel way.

1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:34.800
 So is Uniswap in some sense a competitor Coinbase in which way is it, in which way is it not?

1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:40.720
 So because for people who don't know, Coinbase is centralized.

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:49.200
 So let me ask, does that go against the spirit of crypto since crypto is, is, is decentralized?

1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:54.000
 What are the pros and cons of being centralized as an exchange?

1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:56.040
 So I don't think Coinbase is fully centralized there.

1:05:56.040 --> 1:06:01.040
 We have many different products and the way that I think about it is that our exchange

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:06.240
 or our brokerage is a centralized regulated financial service business.

1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:10.160
 And it's actually important for the crypto ecosystem to have that because you want to

1:06:10.160 --> 1:06:13.440
 allow a lot of the fiat money in the world to flow into the crypto economy.

1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:15.960
 So we, you know, we're very proud of that.

1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:18.680
 And I think we've helped a lot of that money flow in.

1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:22.160
 Now once people have money in crypto, they can choose to hold it in a variety of ways

1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:26.280
 and they can choose to hold it in a self custodial wallet, which is more decentralized.

1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:32.720
 They can choose to use decentralized exchanges, which we love and Uniswap is not really a,

1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:35.120
 I don't think of them as like a direct competitor to us.

1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:38.520
 We basically have integrated Uniswap into a number of our products.

1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:41.520
 We love DeFi decentralized exchanges the whole thing.

1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:48.320
 So Coinbase wallet, which is a self custodial wallet is more decentralized and it allows

1:06:48.320 --> 1:06:51.480
 people to hold their own crypto.

1:06:51.480 --> 1:06:52.560
 They don't have to trust us.

1:06:52.560 --> 1:06:55.960
 Can you explain what a self custodial wallet is?

1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:58.960
 What is a wallet and what is a self custodial wallet?

1:06:58.960 --> 1:06:59.960
 Yeah.

1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:00.960
 So it's confusing.

1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:06.600
 So, so a custodial wallet means you're trusting Coinbase to store your crypto, the private

1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:08.800
 keys themselves.

1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:12.240
 And you know, for some people and institutions and everything, just meeting them where they

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:18.160
 are today, that's nice because it's simpler, you know, they're not afraid of losing their

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:20.720
 crypto if they make some accident accidental mistake.

1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:26.080
 Or so, you know, a custodial crypto products are important to help get a bunch of people

1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:27.640
 into the ecosystem.

1:07:27.640 --> 1:07:30.560
 But I'm very supportive of self custodial wallets.

1:07:30.560 --> 1:07:34.160
 And I think in some ways they are the future because more and more people are going to

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:37.320
 want to store their own crypto, not trust a third party institution to do it.

1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:40.200
 And in some ways that is much more authentic to the ethos of crypto.

1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:45.920
 So Coinbase will help you convert the fiat into crypto in a, frankly, that's a more centralized

1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:46.920
 thing.

1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:50.000
 But once you have crypto, you can then go to the self custodial world, store it yourself

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.640
 in a, to get into the technical details just for a second.

1:07:53.640 --> 1:07:58.040
 It's basically saying you're going to store the keys on your own device.

1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:03.640
 And so even if Coinbase, you know, gets some court order to seize it, we actually can't

1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:06.720
 like from an architecture point of view, we can't do it.

1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:09.640
 Or you know, if Coinbase gets hacked or something, we can't lose your funds.

1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:13.000
 Like now you, the thing is you have to take the responsibility because we're not taking

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:14.000
 it.

1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.160
 So the individual person could get hacked, right?

1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:21.200
 And there's a whole bunch of really cool research happening to make self custodial wallets more

1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:28.440
 resilient to accidental loss, hacks, and just user error, like, you know, I don't know how

1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:32.440
 much you've looked at like various cryptography things, but there's like, basically, you can

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:37.520
 have multiple multi sig, multiple signatures from different keys on different devices where

1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:39.920
 you need like two of the three or three of the five.

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:45.040
 There's a whole technology called a multi party computation or threshold signing signatures,

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:46.600
 which is really cool.

1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:48.480
 But those are the things you would run locally?

1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:49.480
 Yeah.

1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:53.720
 Like what these are all security measures, like cryptography measures to protect you

1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:56.480
 without a centralized component.

1:08:56.480 --> 1:08:57.480
 Right.

1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:03.280
 So like a simple example would be, let's say you had a two of three key signature and

1:09:03.280 --> 1:09:05.880
 you know, one key might be sort of Coinbase, but that's not a quorum.

1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:09.800
 So we couldn't unilaterally move your funds, but another key is on your device, on your

1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:10.800
 phone, let's say.

1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:11.800
 Oh, cool.

1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:17.640
 So that, so in a normal situation, you have a key on your phone, we have one, but you,

1:09:17.640 --> 1:09:21.120
 and so two out of three, now just, you know, it can all get signed very quickly for day

1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:22.120
 to day use.

1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:24.080
 But let's say you lose your phone or something.

1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:27.920
 Now there has to be a third key and that's where, you know, you could store it in a backup

1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:34.760
 somewhere, like in Google Drive or iCloud, you could trust a third party that's not Coinbase

1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:39.360
 to also have that one key and they can't do anything unilaterally with that one key.

1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:42.200
 So that's a simple example, you can get, you can get way more complicated.

1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:43.200
 Yeah, that's an awesome idea.

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:50.520
 And so like if your funds get seized, Coinbase can't, can't do anything, but you better not

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:52.480
 lose your phone, maybe in that case.

1:09:52.480 --> 1:09:53.480
 Yeah.

1:09:53.480 --> 1:09:54.480
 So that's okay.

1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:57.360
 But it provides a, there is, so even if you lose your phone, then there is a recovery

1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:01.480
 mechanism because you can get the one key from Coinbase, the one from your backup provider

1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:03.880
 and recover a new one back on your phone.

1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:04.880
 No, no, yeah.

1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:10.000
 So what if Coinbase is no longer, but because of government, because of say it's in North

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:15.040
 Korea, government says you're no longer like Coinbase is shut down in that country or something

1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:16.040
 like that.

1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:17.040
 Right.

1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:19.560
 Then you can get it even if you have access to those two.

1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:20.560
 Right.

1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:26.920
 So again, perhaps a silly question, but isn't a self custodial wallet a competitor as a

1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:29.240
 notion to Coinbase?

1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:33.520
 No, I mean, we, so we offer a self custodial wallet.

1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:34.680
 We've built one and it's like.

1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:41.200
 Doesn't it bleed the, like I guess I'm asking a sort of a financial question is like, how

1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:44.040
 does Coinbase make money on transactions?

1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:48.720
 So does this not, does it does not decrease the number or does not significantly negatively

1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:54.400
 affect transactions or are you more focused on growing the number of the pie of the number

1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:56.200
 of people that are using cryptocurrency?

1:10:56.200 --> 1:10:57.200
 Yeah.

1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:01.840
 Like a traditional financial service firm would probably say, well, we should be storing,

1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:05.880
 let's keep more of the custody with us because that's how we prove to the world that we're

1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:07.520
 valuable or whatever.

1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:08.760
 I don't really believe that.

1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:12.440
 Like I think that actually we kind of want to encourage our users to move to self custody

1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:15.160
 over time for those who are ready and willing.

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:16.680
 And that technology needs to mature.

1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:19.080
 I'm not trying to like force anybody to do it or doesn't want to do it.

1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:23.960
 But to me, that's like the future of how we get billions of people using crypto.

1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:26.280
 But doesn't that mean they can go somewhere else?

1:11:26.280 --> 1:11:27.280
 Easier?

1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:28.280
 Yeah.

1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:31.080
 That's sort of the point is like we're all using the same protocol.

1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:34.680
 So there's low switching costs, which keeps all the companies accountable, right?

1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:39.600
 Like if you, if you want to access the Visa network, there's only one company in the world

1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:41.840
 you can go through to do that, like Visa.

1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:45.520
 But if you want to access the Bitcoin network, there's dozens or hundreds of companies out

1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:46.520
 there who can do that.

1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:51.520
 So it's, you know, it's arguably, you could argue it's worse for us as a company, but

1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:55.560
 I think it's better for, it's what makes Bitcoin interesting and cryptocurrency interesting

1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:58.160
 is that nobody controls it.

1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:00.040
 There is low switching cost for customers.

1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:01.320
 It's better for customers.

1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:04.480
 And that means that all the companies in the space are going to be held to a high standard

1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:07.000
 because the minute you lose someone's trust, they're just going to move their Bitcoin to

1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.880
 some other service.

1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:10.320
 And that's good for the world.

1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:16.160
 Do you think of Coinbase as, so there's these ideas of layer one, layer two, layer three

1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:17.160
 technologies.

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:18.160
 Yeah.

1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:21.800
 Do you think of Coinbase as layer one, layer two, layer three?

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:29.080
 Now that, that said, there's so many products that are under the Coinbase umbrella that's

1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:32.960
 hard to answer that question, but what do you think, do you acknowledge the existence

1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:36.640
 of layer three?

1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:39.800
 So, you know, usually when people are using those terms layer one, layer two, so they're

1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:44.560
 referring to like layer one would be the blockchain, layer one blockchain itself, like a Bitcoin

1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:45.960
 or Ethereum or something.

1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:51.880
 Not like a centralized service like Coinbase or even our decentralized self custodial wallet.

1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:56.560
 So yeah, I wouldn't consider us to be like a layer one.

1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:00.880
 These are the decentralized protocols that we're integrating, but we are Coinbase itself

1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:01.880
 is not those.

1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:02.880
 Yes.

1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:07.440
 But layer two is the thing that was basically doing transactions without the settlement

1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:08.440
 on the blockchain.

1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:15.160
 And so you get to have some of the benefits of faster transactions without the security

1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:16.560
 associated with the blockchain.

1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:23.200
 And layer three is I suppose sort of apps built on top of that.

1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:28.360
 So, you know, at least I think talking to Michael Saylor, he considers Coinbase a layer

1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:29.360
 three technology.

1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:30.360
 Interesting.

1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:31.360
 Okay.

1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:36.040
 I don't even, I'm not really particularly familiar with this kind of distinction of

1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:37.440
 layer three and two.

1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:40.480
 I don't see them as fundamentally different.

1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:46.400
 But some of the, okay, I mean, one way of asking that, is there some layer two like

1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:53.120
 of magic happening in order to make transactions associated with the blockchain happen?

1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:58.920
 And so that they're quick, so that on Coinbase, yeah.

1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:03.120
 Is there some magic going on because you're, okay, we should say how many cryptocurrencies

1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:06.480
 are currently on Coinbase, so it's more than two.

1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:07.480
 Yeah.

1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:09.040
 It's a lot more than two.

1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:13.960
 So you have to understand, they have to incorporate all these technologies.

1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:20.080
 So how do you make that magic of sort of universal transactions happen across all of these different

1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:23.400
 cryptocurrencies?

1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:25.840
 There's our centralized products and decentralized products, right?

1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:31.200
 The centralized products, we are storing that crypto for you.

1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:35.400
 And so if you're moving from one of your accounts to another account, like an ETH, ETH one account

1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:41.280
 to ETH two account, or from my ETH, ETH Coinbase centralized account to your ETH, so we can

1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:43.600
 do that transaction off chain to make it faster.

1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:47.080
 And it saves the customer fees and it just confirms instantly.

1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:49.800
 But it's not truly using the decentralized blockchain, right?

1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:54.160
 So you can also send any Bitcoin address or Ethereum address, for instance, and that

1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:56.480
 is putting the transaction on chain.

1:14:56.480 --> 1:15:01.680
 Now our decentralized products like Coinbase Wallet, the self custodial wallet, every transaction

1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:03.680
 is happening on chain with that.

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:07.480
 And so basically, it just shows a little bit of the evolution of Coinbase and the blockchains

1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:08.480
 themselves.

1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:15.360
 Like in the early days, these networks were not scalable, and so there were no L2 solutions,

1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:16.920
 for instance.

1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:20.920
 And so we had to do these hacks, like moving the crypto off chain if you were moving between

1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:22.360
 your own accounts and stuff like that.

1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:26.600
 Otherwise, the minor fees would have just eaten us alive as a company.

1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:29.880
 But now that the blockchains are starting to scale, there's a whole bunch more work

1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:32.360
 that needs to be done on that, and we're getting L2 solutions.

1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:37.040
 So I think more and more of the transactions are going on chain, whether it's L2, L1.

1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:46.280
 And ideally, we shouldn't be doing that many transactions off chain, just internal Coinbase

1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:47.280
 ledger or something.

1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:48.840
 That's not really in the spirit of crypto.

1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:51.320
 So when you say on chain, that includes a lightning now.

1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:57.280
 That includes layer 2 technology that the blockchain proposes.

1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:04.480
 So I guess I was asking how much fun magic is happening off chain within Coinbase, and

1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:09.720
 you're saying in the early days you had to, but you're trying to do less and less.

1:16:09.720 --> 1:16:13.360
 So look, there's a bunch of high frequency traders that use the centralized products,

1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:18.920
 and even just regular retail people, they don't want to pay the gas fees and stuff.

1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:26.120
 It actually, back at the envelope, calculated this out at one point, and it would be completely

1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:29.920
 infeasible for high frequency traders to put everything on chain at this point.

1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:31.520
 That's basically what DEXs are doing.

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:33.600
 And so both are important.

1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:36.960
 I think more and more is going to move decentralized over time, which is great.

1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:37.960
 And we're basically...

1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:42.880
 DEXs are decentralized exchanges, by the way.

1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:46.920
 So anyway, we want to encourage more and more of it to move decentralized over time.

1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:50.320
 But the centralized things aren't going away for a long time.

1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:56.280
 A decade from now, there's going to be some big institution or pension fund or central

1:16:56.280 --> 1:17:00.560
 bank that's like, all right, we got to hold crypto, let's set up the account in a centralized

1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:01.560
 way.

1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:02.560
 So that's fine.

1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:03.560
 Both are important.

1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:07.280
 Do you know the number of cryptocurrencies currently on Coinbase?

1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:08.280
 Do you know that number?

1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:15.480
 It's over a hundred, but it depends what jurisdiction you're in and are you an institution

1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:16.480
 versus retail.

1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:18.280
 There's so many different categories now.

1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:21.720
 But over a hundred, yeah.

1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:30.440
 So what does it take to become an asset, to become a cryptocurrency on Coinbase, to add

1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:32.960
 your technology to Coinbase?

1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:38.480
 Okay, well, so we're trying to get away from this idea of being listed on Coinbase as being

1:17:38.480 --> 1:17:42.800
 seen as an endorsement or something, because I actually think it's very important that

1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:49.400
 we are not considered judge and jury about, imagine it was the early days of the internet

1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:51.600
 and you were like, what's a good webpage and what's a bad webpage?

1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:52.800
 You would have been totally wrong.

1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:59.560
 Or anytime big tech companies try to make these review boards of like, Apple famously

1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:02.880
 gets in trouble for this a lot with their app store review process.

1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:07.720
 And so something that you think, like a committee of people somewhere thinks looks silly may

1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:09.360
 turn out to be the next big thing, right?

1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:10.720
 And so it's very difficult.

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:11.720
 So what do we do?

1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:15.320
 I mean, we basically have a test of legality, right?

1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:19.920
 We check, you know, do we believe this is a security?

1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:21.760
 If so, it can't be listed on Coinbase.

1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:25.280
 And there's a very rigorous process we go through for that.

1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:27.960
 Just currently the way the laws are in the US, you can't do that.

1:18:27.960 --> 1:18:31.960
 And we acquired a broker duo license from the SEC, we're trying to work with them to

1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:32.960
 get that operational.

1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:36.760
 And hopefully someday we can trade real crypto securities, but today that's not possible

1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:39.040
 in the US at least.

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:43.480
 Then we look at sort of the cybersecurity of the crypto asset, do we see that there's

1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:49.880
 some flaw in the smart contract or, you know, a way that somebody could manipulate it without

1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:52.600
 the customer's permission?

1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:57.360
 We look at some compliance pieces to it as well, like the actors behind it and like,

1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:59.840
 you know, they're any kind of criminal history or anything like that.

1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:06.240
 But if we believe it meets our listing standards, basically this test of legality and everything

1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:11.160
 for customer protection, then we want to list it because we want the market to at that point

1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:12.160
 decide.

1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:18.160
 And it's kind of like Amazon or something like that where, you know, a product might

1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:22.600
 have three stars or it might have five stars, but if it starts to get one star consistently,

1:19:22.600 --> 1:19:26.960
 like it's probably a fraudulent or it's defective or something like maybe Amazon will move it.

1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:31.480
 But otherwise you want to let the market decide what these things are.

1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:33.000
 So that's generally how we do it.

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:38.360
 And by the way, more and more of these assets, I think, especially like low market cap assets

1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:40.600
 are going to be traded on DEXs through Coinbase.

1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:45.240
 It's not that we, we don't need to list every asset on a centralized exchange.

1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:47.920
 I think DEXs are really good for the long tail.

1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:52.160
 And then it becomes an even, it's even more clear to people like this is not some endorsement

1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:55.520
 by a Coinbase of like, this asset's good and this one's bad.

1:19:55.520 --> 1:19:59.120
 Like, you know, my, my belief is there's going to be millions of these assets over time.

1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:03.760
 And so I hope it doesn't like make news every time we add one in the future.

1:20:03.760 --> 1:20:10.680
 Yeah, I wonder how you get there because I, even I look to Coinbase for, for example,

1:20:10.680 --> 1:20:15.320
 you know, people, as you could imagine, sort of tag me on Twitter or something like that

1:20:15.320 --> 1:20:22.000
 and all that, like you should interview our sort of this, the founder of this particular

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:23.000
 coin, right?

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:24.000
 Yeah.

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:30.880
 It's so hard for me to know what's, first of all, what's an interesting technology?

1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:35.000
 What's, uh, who's a scammer or not?

1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:43.680
 Who's actually legitimately representing an ambitious new thing versus a scam?

1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:50.720
 And I, you know, there's very few sources of, uh, like verification signal.

1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:56.080
 And unfortunately Coinbase in part has become a little bit of that too, and you're trying

1:20:56.080 --> 1:20:59.960
 to get away from that because you're trying to get as many sort of, let, let the people

1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:00.960
 decide.

1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:05.280
 So you're thinking of like Amazon star type system where the people could rate.

1:21:05.280 --> 1:21:06.280
 Yeah.

1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:09.120
 So I think we'll actually probably add like user ratings and reviews.

1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:14.240
 So, um, and we're, we'll be very cautious about like, you know, these are real people.

1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:17.420
 Um, there's a bunch of stuff we have to do from that already.

1:21:17.420 --> 1:21:22.040
 So I think wisdom of the crowds is good in terms of getting feedback on items.

1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:25.240
 But we also, we're going to do our own review, which I mentioned earlier, right?

1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:28.840
 Which is like, okay, it meets this minimum bar to be listed on our site.

1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:29.840
 Yeah.

1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:32.280
 Um, but I think, yeah, both are important.

1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:35.840
 How do you know if a coin is a scam or not?

1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:39.120
 Well, you can, you can see a few things.

1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:42.280
 So, you know, I hate to use the word scam because a lot of these, these are judgment

1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:43.280
 calls.

1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:46.600
 You got a, I kind of, a court made it may or a jury may land either way, but things

1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:52.480
 that would be red flags to look at would be, um, you know, is a bunch of the asset owned

1:21:52.480 --> 1:22:01.640
 by an insider or insiders, um, with short vesting periods, um, you know, are just the

1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:05.480
 background of the founders, like they may have criminal records or if they've perpetrated

1:22:05.480 --> 1:22:07.680
 other frauds in the past, right?

1:22:07.680 --> 1:22:13.960
 Um, there's a difference between something which is just a me too product.

1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:17.440
 It's like, it doesn't have anything interesting about it and something that's an actual fraud

1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:18.440
 or outright scam.

1:22:18.440 --> 1:22:22.880
 And, um, you have to, a lot of this data, what's cool about it is that it's now available

1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:23.880
 on chain.

1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:28.200
 You can look at like the tokenomics behind it and see who owns it and are they, yeah,

1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:34.120
 and are they selling it, you know, in like inappropriately or are they pumping it on

1:22:34.120 --> 1:22:39.320
 like YouTube and Twitter and making promises about, Hey, the value of this thing may be

1:22:39.320 --> 1:22:44.480
 a higher in the future and like all those are just big, big no knows that we would, um,

1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:45.920
 you know, we just don't want to go there.

1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:51.040
 So our whole thing is like, we want, we want to enable the innovation in this space, but

1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:56.480
 not allow anybody to curtail the advancement of this industry by like doing some kind of

1:22:56.480 --> 1:22:58.480
 fraudulent thing or get rich quick thing.

1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:04.000
 So it's a tricky industry because I'm trying to figure out who to, you know, uh, what's

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:09.880
 interesting to, to, to, to understand, to research and, uh, it's hard to know.

1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:14.280
 Let me ask you about a trick you want to add to a centralized exchange, which is privacy

1:23:14.280 --> 1:23:16.280
 preserving cryptocurrency.

1:23:16.280 --> 1:23:22.840
 So like Monero, is that, is that technically difficult or is that why, why is like Monero,

1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:28.520
 for example, forget that specific one, but like privacy preserving cryptocurrency block

1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:29.520
 chains.

1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:33.400
 Uh, why is that, is that ever possible to add?

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:35.120
 So that's, that's a great question.

1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:40.320
 So the answer is maybe, so, um, here's the, here's the, what, the reason why.

1:23:40.320 --> 1:23:45.760
 So, um, because we're regulated financial service business, we have various, um, licenses

1:23:45.760 --> 1:23:46.760
 to do that.

1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:48.600
 We are, we are regulated by various regulators.

1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:53.400
 Part of those licenses requires us to have a, quote, reasonable, um, program to monitor

1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:59.720
 for suspicious activity, um, you know, an AML program, anti money laundering, right?

1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:05.400
 And so if it, if a coin is 100% anonymous and we can't really do blockchain analytics

1:24:05.400 --> 1:24:10.520
 to track, um, source of funds and where these things might be going, it makes it harder

1:24:10.520 --> 1:24:15.240
 to have a, um, a reasonable program around that.

1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:16.240
 That's defensible.

1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:20.480
 Now there are privacy preserving coins like Zcash, which have something called a view

1:24:20.480 --> 1:24:25.960
 key and a view key is basically another key, which allows you to deanonymize, um, the transactions

1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:28.200
 in specific situations where you want that.

1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:32.080
 So for instance, um, you know, we do support Zcash and one of the ways we got comfortable

1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:37.240
 with that is that when you're buying it on Coinbase, um, you know, you can basically

1:24:37.240 --> 1:24:41.200
 have a view key, the, the transactions are not anonymous while you're buying it and we

1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:44.760
 can see where it goes afterwards and do our, our whole standard program.

1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:49.760
 Um, now if it gets a few hops away down the road, I mean, people could eventually turn

1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:51.920
 on privacy preserving aspects.

1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:55.920
 So you know, these are tough judgment calls, but at least in terms of our interaction with

1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:58.560
 the customer and everything, we feel comfortable at that.

1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:03.400
 I think there's a broader point here, which is that I actually think privacy coins are

1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:08.400
 a good thing for the world and we, and they should be allowed and more like, you know,

1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:11.360
 despite we've made, we've made this judgment call to operate in a regulated and safe and

1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:15.880
 compliant way, but just taking my Coinbase head off for a minute, I think the world would

1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:20.720
 be a better place if there were more privacy coins because it's kind of like the internet

1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:24.600
 when it first came online, like there was no HTTPS.

1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:27.800
 Everything was HTTP and there was, you know, so people were afraid to put their credit

1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:32.000
 cards on the internet and, um, your, your messages could be intercepted and all the

1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:33.000
 stuff.

1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:36.800
 And now the whole internet has basically moved to HTTPS with a little lock icon in your browser,

1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:37.800
 which is better.

1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:41.720
 Like, and, and financial information is like the most important information to keep private.

1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:42.720
 Right.

1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:46.400
 So there's times where like, let's say you're running a charity or something and you want

1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:50.720
 to have total auditability, transparency for the whole world, who donated and where did

1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:51.720
 the money go?

1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:52.720
 That's great.

1:25:52.720 --> 1:25:53.720
 You want it to be public.

1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:57.280
 If it's like your personal money or something like that, you don't want to be broadcasting

1:25:57.280 --> 1:25:58.280
 that to the whole world.

1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:02.400
 And in some ways that's what blockchains are doing, you know, pseudonymously because like,

1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:03.640
 but it is a public ledger.

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:07.720
 And so if you can know who owns each address, you can basically deanonymize it.

1:26:07.720 --> 1:26:13.480
 I, you know, I think basically the people should fight for, um, privacy and freedoms

1:26:13.480 --> 1:26:16.120
 of all kinds, but privacy of money is a good thing.

1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:17.640
 So I would like to see more of that in the future.

1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:25.240
 Be chosen with Coinbase to, to, uh, to have a seat at the table with the regulators.

1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:31.560
 So what kind of, what kind of conversations are there at that table?

1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:33.680
 What are the regulations like?

1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:37.040
 What is the level of understanding with regulators?

1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:38.240
 What are they worried about?

1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:39.400
 What are they thinking about?

1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:45.000
 What are the positive and what are the negative, uh, regulations that you're facing that you're

1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:50.000
 educating, struggling with, pushing back on, supporting, all that kind of stuff.

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:51.000
 Yeah.

1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:56.200
 Oh man, there's so many because we're, I mean, we're live in like, you know, maybe 100 countries

1:26:56.200 --> 1:26:57.200
 are more at this point.

1:26:57.200 --> 1:26:59.200
 So the, the conversations are all over the map.

1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:02.120
 Um, I'm trying to think what broad strokes I could paint for you.

1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:07.440
 So I'd say one trend that's, that's positive is that basically regulators around the world

1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:12.440
 are, are more and more over the last five years, I would say it's more and more common

1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:17.880
 to find a regulator today asking, how can we preserve the innovation potential of this

1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:21.320
 technology while keeping the bad actors out?

1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:24.560
 Then it was five years ago where they were saying, this is all bad activity.

1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:26.040
 How do we prevent it?

1:27:26.040 --> 1:27:34.920
 And so, um, maybe this is when you say more and more, what fraction, I'll give you like

1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:38.240
 a US specific example, although we operate in many countries.

1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:45.080
 So when I go to DC now, I would say, you know, 50, 60% of the people who I meet with are

1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:50.360
 basically, you know, they're in the camp of crypto has a lot of potential.

1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:53.720
 We should regulate it to make sure the bad people don't do something bad with it.

1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:56.320
 But this is here to stay and it has a lot of upside.

1:27:56.320 --> 1:28:01.440
 We should basically, um, create the awful regulation and celebrate it and actually encourage

1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:03.400
 this innovation to happen in the US.

1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:08.240
 That's a huge change from just three years ago where it was probably 30% of people saying

1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:10.520
 that now it's like 60, it's like almost double.

1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:14.480
 It's getting harder to find like true cryptoskeptics in DC.

1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:20.480
 Um, I'd say that, you know, maybe, maybe only like 20 or 30% of people are like willing

1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:24.280
 to say something negative, like they actually think it's net negative is like, it's really

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:28.560
 hard to defend that position at this point because it's almost like one in five Americans

1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:30.120
 have used or tried crypto at this point.

1:28:30.120 --> 1:28:33.600
 So you're, you're kind of condemning 20% of your fellow citizens, if you say that at

1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:38.300
 this point, um, you know, especially with NFTs and all these things, like a huge segment

1:28:38.300 --> 1:28:41.600
 of people who don't even care about investing or whatever came into the space.

1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:48.800
 So, and then basically that's that same conversation is happening, um, but you know, delayed by

1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:55.120
 a few years in, in like India and Europe and in some Asian countries and, um, some countries

1:28:55.120 --> 1:29:00.080
 have really embraced crypto and they're like trying to really, they're, they're the head

1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:04.000
 of where the U S is because they're trying to actually, uh, attract the best startups

1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:07.980
 and entrepreneurs like, you know, like Dubai and UK and Australia and all are kind of pushing

1:29:07.980 --> 1:29:08.980
 good regulation.

1:29:08.980 --> 1:29:13.560
 Um, El Salvador actually, I guess adopted it as like Bitcoin is legal tender, right?

1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:17.140
 There was another country, Central African Republic, I think that is supposedly did that

1:29:17.140 --> 1:29:22.120
 as well, but you know, there's countries like China that are more autocratic that are saying,

1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:26.480
 Hey, this is a threat to our power and like, we're going to try to really curtail it.

1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:32.360
 So what kind of regulations are there that you feel the most that are limiting or that

1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:33.360
 are empowering?

1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:35.000
 Like, is there specific examples?

1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:36.000
 Yeah.

1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:37.000
 Okay.

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:42.080
 So, um, I mean, basically I think the securities laws in the U S need to be clarified about,

1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:45.720
 um, what there's crypto is many different things.

1:29:45.720 --> 1:29:46.720
 That's what people don't realize.

1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:52.080
 So like some crypto, like Bitcoin, Ethereum and many others are probably more like commodities

1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:57.440
 Um, they're not controlled by anyone person, you know, like, anyway, there's people who

1:29:57.440 --> 1:29:59.000
 want to raise money for a company.

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:03.020
 That's sounds more like a security that should be regulated by the SEC commodities regulated

1:30:03.020 --> 1:30:04.680
 by the CFTC.

1:30:04.680 --> 1:30:08.640
 Then there's some cryptocurrencies, which are more like, uh, currencies like stable

1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:10.800
 coins and central bank digital currencies.

1:30:10.800 --> 1:30:14.600
 And those are probably, you know, it should be regulated by the treasury or someone like

1:30:14.600 --> 1:30:15.600
 that.

1:30:15.600 --> 1:30:18.160
 And then there's a whole another category of cryptocurrencies, which are none of those

1:30:18.160 --> 1:30:19.160
 things.

1:30:19.160 --> 1:30:23.680
 Like artwork or their metaverse items or decentralized identity and voting.

1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:32.320
 And so I think that there's a very, um, unhelpful point of view out there by some folks, which

1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:36.320
 is, Hey, this is all, most of this is like bad activity.

1:30:36.320 --> 1:30:37.880
 We need to shut it down.

1:30:37.880 --> 1:30:41.320
 So we're just going to pursue enforcement actions or something like that.

1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:43.120
 Most people in DC don't feel that way anymore.

1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:46.280
 And I think the people of the U S don't feel that way anymore because a lot of them are

1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:50.880
 using this stuff and their, their general view is there's a lot of upside potential here.

1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:51.880
 We can all agree.

1:30:51.880 --> 1:30:53.000
 Let's get rid of the fraud and the scams.

1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:54.520
 We all want to get rid of that.

1:30:54.520 --> 1:31:01.860
 So let's create a relatively simple test which says, you know, if it's like nobody controls

1:31:01.860 --> 1:31:05.620
 more than 20% of it or some threshold, it probably is more like a commodity.

1:31:05.620 --> 1:31:10.480
 If someone's raising money for, they're selling this thing for a business, then it's probably

1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:11.480
 a security.

1:31:11.480 --> 1:31:15.200
 And then, you know, if it's more like a medium of exchange, it's a currency.

1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:19.280
 And if it's none of those things, maybe it's artwork or whatever, a test, a legal test

1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:23.720
 like that would help clarify who, which regulator is regulating what.

1:31:23.720 --> 1:31:28.360
 And then, you know, we also want to have probably like a sandbox for innovation where

1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:33.600
 if you're a startup and you're doing less than, I don't know, some number, less than

1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:37.280
 some amount of payment volume or customer funds you're storing, it's like, just let

1:31:37.280 --> 1:31:42.240
 those things get off the ground without a soul crushing amount of legal bills, you know,

1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:43.240
 an uncertainty.

1:31:43.240 --> 1:31:46.000
 If the US can get there, that would be great.

1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:49.440
 I think a bunch of other countries now are rushing around the world to sort of create

1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:52.680
 that regulation that it does attract innovation.

1:31:52.680 --> 1:31:58.080
 And so in the national international bodies like IMF and G20 and stuff, they're starting

1:31:58.080 --> 1:32:00.120
 to look at proposed regulation.

1:32:00.120 --> 1:32:03.160
 I hope that Coinbase and a bunch of other crypto companies can help in that conversation

1:32:03.160 --> 1:32:04.160
 too.

1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:05.160
 We have a whole policy effort.

1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:08.400
 I think actually crypto policy efforts are like probably one of the biggest things in

1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:09.400
 DC right now.

1:32:09.400 --> 1:32:13.680
 So it moves slow at the speed of government.

1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:18.320
 But yeah, and in the meantime, we're just trying to help more and more people use crypto

1:32:18.320 --> 1:32:22.200
 because ultimately that's what in the democracies, that's what they care about.

1:32:22.200 --> 1:32:24.360
 Like they'll do what the people of the country want.

1:32:24.360 --> 1:32:30.280
 So you want governments to start understanding differences between in the crypto space, commodities,

1:32:30.280 --> 1:32:34.360
 securities, currencies, NFTs, I still don't understand.

1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:37.200
 What are they supposed to make sense of NFTs?

1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:43.080
 What is NFTs exactly from a perspective of a regulator?

1:32:43.080 --> 1:32:44.320
 Is it the other categories?

1:32:44.320 --> 1:32:45.320
 Yeah.

1:32:45.320 --> 1:32:48.640
 You know, most NFTs you could think of as like artwork, although it's who knows where

1:32:48.640 --> 1:32:49.640
 it's going to go.

1:32:49.640 --> 1:32:50.640
 It could be more broader.

1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:51.640
 You mentioned metaverse, right?

1:32:51.640 --> 1:32:52.640
 Yeah.

1:32:52.640 --> 1:32:54.400
 You mentioned some kind of unique identity of a thing.

1:32:54.400 --> 1:32:55.400
 Yeah.

1:32:55.400 --> 1:32:59.040
 I mean, there's people selling virtual land in NFTs.

1:32:59.040 --> 1:33:04.720
 I actually, I bought this NFT that's like, it's like citizenship in this like city,

1:33:04.720 --> 1:33:11.400
 Dow in Wyoming, like I've never been there, but it's almost like a badge or at a station

1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:14.800
 like to get access to this location.

1:33:14.800 --> 1:33:19.720
 There's like people doing like tickets to events, like, you know, they're called a Poops,

1:33:19.720 --> 1:33:23.680
 like proof of attendance and things like that.

1:33:23.680 --> 1:33:27.800
 So it'll be very interesting to see where NFTs go over time.

1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:29.920
 It could get, and that's the danger.

1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:32.320
 You don't want to try to like define the regulation if you don't even know where this

1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:33.320
 thing's going to go.

1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:36.920
 And so your efforts in the policy arm is education?

1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:37.920
 Yeah.

1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:42.680
 Education, advocacy, we're just trying to be like a helpful educational resource essentially.

1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:47.040
 And then if they give us feedback and like, hey, don't do this or don't do this, like

1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:50.600
 we're more than happy to do anything that's requested.

1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:54.320
 We generally go get licenses and we've just tried to do the right thing in the absence

1:33:54.320 --> 1:34:00.440
 of clarity because if it's not clear what the law says, then you should just basically

1:34:00.440 --> 1:34:03.920
 do good things that you think may be required in the future to show good faith effort towards

1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:05.420
 the right thing.

1:34:05.420 --> 1:34:10.520
 And that's part of like innovating in a regulated field, which is, you know, a whole topic in

1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:11.520
 itself.

1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:18.120
 So if you are at the table, I mean, this is less the case in the United States, but can

1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:24.960
 government agencies seize a person's cryptocurrency by forcing Coinbase to hand it over?

1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:28.120
 So when you're centralized, they have a phone number to call.

1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:32.440
 Okay, so this is a complicated topic.

1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:36.360
 If you really want to be sure that, this is why people want to store their own crypto,

1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:37.360
 right?

1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:40.360
 Like with self custodial wallets, like with Coinbase wallet embracing decentralization,

1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:42.200
 they want to avoid that.

1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:44.860
 Now in the US, there is rule of law, right?

1:34:44.860 --> 1:34:49.680
 So we have reasonable protections in place around like search and seizure and things

1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:50.680
 like that.

1:34:50.680 --> 1:34:54.480
 You know, Coinbase does, we publish transparency reports on this.

1:34:54.480 --> 1:35:00.800
 We get subpoenas, court orders, things like that from various countries around the world.

1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:08.360
 And there are situations where we have been ordered to freeze accounts, things like that.

1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:12.000
 You know, we have to follow the law is another way to put it, we're a regulated financial

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:13.000
 service business.

1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.000
 And so...

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:18.800
 If the money is used to break as part of breaking the law, that's what that, in a particular

1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:22.160
 jurisdiction, in a particular...

1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:23.160
 Right.

1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:26.320
 And then the other thing, sometimes we will actually get court orders or subpoenas that

1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:28.320
 are overly broad.

1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:31.040
 So they need to follow due process, right?

1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:35.960
 And so we've seen some in the past that were like, well, we need you to freeze this huge

1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:36.960
 number of accounts.

1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:40.320
 And it's like, well, we'll actually have gone to court and like pushed back on some of these

1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:44.520
 and said like, what is your, the probable cause and has the threshold been met?

1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:47.000
 And like we've won some of those cases on behalf of our customers.

1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:52.520
 So yeah, it's actually really, it's kind of unfortunate and frustrating as a, you know,

1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:59.520
 as a large business, you spend a lot of resources basically interacting with inbound requests

1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:03.760
 by all kinds of lawyers and people and requesting things.

1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:07.520
 And some of them are silly and ridiculous and you have to push back and say, no.

1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:13.120
 And so it's kind of a tax on every company at a certain size, which ultimately gets passed

1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:15.280
 onto the customer in higher fees.

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:18.560
 So you have to employ armies of lawyers to deal with this stuff.

1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:19.960
 Can you educate me on something?

1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:23.960
 How much innovation is there in the legal space?

1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:29.960
 So for lawyers working with Coinbase, because it's such a new cutting edge thing.

1:36:29.960 --> 1:36:36.640
 So you're, if there's a lot of gray area, you're supposed to be operating under like

1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:41.200
 how hard is it being a lawyer at Coinbase?

1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:43.360
 Like how much precedence is there?

1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:44.520
 I guess is what I'm asking.

1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:48.200
 I mean, just like you said, three years.

1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:49.720
 It's kind of a new space.

1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:50.720
 Yeah.

1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:54.920
 Well, it's probably very hard to be a lawyer at Coinbase and very fun because, you know,

1:36:54.920 --> 1:37:01.080
 whenever you're in a new field that's growing fast, there isn't a lot of case law and just

1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:02.600
 precedent set.

1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:05.640
 So that's also an opportunity for you to go create that stuff.

1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:09.640
 And that's what a lot of legal careers are made out of is like, take a complex situation

1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:13.400
 where you have to balance difficult things like how do we prevent bad activity, but still

1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:14.400
 enable an innovation?

1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:16.040
 That's a hard question.

1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:20.880
 And there's, you can go draft legislation and circulate it to policy makers or come

1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:25.280
 up with these policies and, you know, how do you operate a business in an environment

1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:27.880
 where the law is just unclear, right?

1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:33.880
 It's like, try to do the right thing, but like, you know, strike the right balance.

1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:37.880
 So yeah, a lot of our lawyers have to come up with that very creative stuff.

1:37:37.880 --> 1:37:41.320
 You mentioned one of the things you're focused on is expanding the number of people, maybe

1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:46.480
 a billion people on Coinbase or using cryptocurrency.

1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:47.480
 Where are we at now?

1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:49.120
 How do we get to a billion?

1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:53.720
 As of Q4 last year, we had 89 million verified accounts on Coinbase.

1:37:53.720 --> 1:38:00.080
 But in any given quarter, only, you know, maybe like 10 or a little more million of those

1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:02.160
 are like really active.

1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:07.360
 So and then if you look at globally, I think some of the estimates I've seen is maybe there's

1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:11.680
 like 200 million people or something like that who have ever used or tried crypto.

1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:17.680
 So we're along, you know, it weighs from a billion, but it's not like that far off.

1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:19.680
 How do you get there?

1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:20.680
 Yeah.

1:38:20.680 --> 1:38:21.680
 Okay.

1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:22.680
 So a few things.

1:38:22.680 --> 1:38:26.200
 One is the blockchains have got to become way more scalable.

1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:29.120
 It's kind of like we're all running dial up modems and we need broadband.

1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:33.240
 And so it's just like too expensive, too slow to do all these transactions.

1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:39.080
 And I think if we just get L2s working and scalability, you know, we'll see another order

1:38:39.080 --> 1:38:42.840
 of magnitude kind of come out just from that.

1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:45.000
 I think the second one would be more clear regulation.

1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:46.840
 That would help a lot.

1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:52.960
 I do talk to, you know, pension funds and, you know, various asset managers, sovereign

1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:53.960
 wealth funds and stuff.

1:38:53.960 --> 1:39:00.320
 And a lot of them tell me we've got 1% of our portfolio in crypto today, but we really

1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:02.240
 would rather have like 20% in there.

1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:08.360
 So what we're waiting for is more clear regulation coming out and saying that clear test that

1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:09.360
 I was saying.

1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:13.800
 These assets are commodities regulated by SEC, these are SEC, these are treasury, whatever.

1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:15.560
 So that would be a big unlock.

1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:16.680
 Do transactions.

1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:24.600
 So one of the things that you mentioned, payments, sorry, what does that unlock a lot of users?

1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:26.080
 Yeah, it does.

1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:28.480
 I mean, remittance is like a huge thing.

1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:32.040
 People sending money home to their families in other countries where the fees are super

1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:33.040
 high.

1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:37.120
 So, yeah, if we get blockchains to be more scalable and there's more global adoption,

1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:42.440
 like I think we'll see remittance quarters move over to crypto a lot.

1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:46.720
 There's also just the other thing that's driving a lot of crypto adoption is basically

1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:49.440
 the creation of more and more third party apps.

1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:52.280
 So or dApps, they're sometimes called decentralized apps.

1:39:52.280 --> 1:39:57.680
 So a lot of startups now, you know how like used to use in the early 2000s, they called

1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:00.680
 them dot com startups, but now you don't need to say dot com because everybody's using the

1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:01.680
 internet.

1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:06.280
 And so now there's like hundreds or thousands of these crypto startups.

1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:08.400
 But I think in the future, you won't need to call them crypto startups because they'll

1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:12.000
 just be called startups because everyone's using the internet and crypto and whatever.

1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:17.880
 So anyway, the use cases, the utility of crypto is getting better and better with like all

1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:20.240
 these third party apps getting funded and created.

1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:25.040
 Do you think there's going to be a killer or a set of killer dApps?

1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:29.400
 Like a thing where nobody can live without, are we still waiting for that?

1:40:29.400 --> 1:40:30.400
 There's going to be a bunch of them.

1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:34.920
 It's just like, it's like the internet, like what were the killer web companies like Uber

1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:38.320
 and Wikipedia and Airbnb and Google.

1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:43.400
 So there's going to be some big winners, but there'll be thousands of, this is basically

1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:47.440
 the new, it's like what happened with the dot com startups in the early 2000s.

1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:50.920
 It's like a lot of the best entrepreneurs are building crypto startups now.

1:40:50.920 --> 1:40:55.160
 So tons of venture money flowing into the space, a lot of smart young people.

1:40:55.160 --> 1:41:00.360
 So do you think Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency will become the reserve currency of the world?

1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:01.360
 At some point?

1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:06.480
 So this is kind of a controversial idea, but I actually think yes.

1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:10.920
 I do think Bitcoin could end up becoming a reserve currency of the world.

1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:16.720
 So I've been reading Ray Dalio recently with his new book, like the changing world order.

1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:19.960
 And I thought it was a really well researched book.

1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:21.760
 He talks in there, he looks back at history, right?

1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:27.680
 He looks at like empires and going back to various Chinese empires, the Dutch and Ottomans

1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:32.600
 and everybody and how did they rise and they were able to have the reserve currency as they

1:41:32.600 --> 1:41:34.360
 rose and what produced that?

1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:39.360
 Like it came from good education and innovation and better trade and anyway.

1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:46.560
 So the US by some measures is kind of looks like it's maybe it's had a really good run

1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:50.000
 and it's coming down a little bit and China is kind of kind of coming up.

1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.520
 Who knows how that'll play out by the way, like the world is very complicated.

1:41:52.520 --> 1:41:55.760
 It could, that could switch.

1:41:55.760 --> 1:42:02.640
 But I guess if the US dollar is going to be seeing more inflation in the future, the Chinese

1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:05.840
 yuan is not like necessarily better, right?

1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:13.600
 I mean, they have a ton of debt as well and you know, it's not like you could really,

1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:15.480
 that the yuan could be inflated as well, right?

1:42:15.480 --> 1:42:17.160
 I probably will be.

1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:23.920
 And so I do think that there's this group of people today, which probably most traditional,

1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:28.600
 I don't know like the people who run big banks and like governments and stuff that they're

1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:31.720
 not, this is not really on their radar today, but I think there's, there's a basically a

1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:37.680
 group of younger people in that kind of, you know, 25, 35 year old range who are tech savvy.

1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:42.240
 They're starting to think of crypto as like the primary thing in their financial life.

1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:48.000
 It's like, I basically hold my wealth in crypto and I use dollars or euros or whatever.

1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.600
 If I, if I happen to need something, I convert it to that at the last minute.

1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:54.000
 It's like, if I, if I go on, if I'm traveling, I might convert some local currency in the

1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.280
 moment, but that's not where I hold most of my wealth.

1:42:57.280 --> 1:43:03.920
 So this segment of the population is not like massive yet from a GDP point of view, but

1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:06.800
 I think it's a leading indicator of where things could be going.

1:43:06.800 --> 1:43:07.960
 And this is actually good for the world.

1:43:07.960 --> 1:43:12.560
 It's kind of like, especially if China does continue to rise and it has a more authoritarian

1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:20.120
 view, it'll be kind of this very centralized East versus a decentralized West where people

1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:25.200
 are in the West, in the free world, really kind of embracing crypto and a more open,

1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:30.520
 fair, free global financial system, which I think will be enormously beneficial for

1:43:30.520 --> 1:43:31.520
 humanity.

1:43:31.520 --> 1:43:37.800
 And I do think basically Bitcoin is the reserve currency, the gold standard of the crypto economy.

1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:38.800
 So that's pretty crazy.

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:39.800
 Yeah.

1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:40.800
 The gold standard.

1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:48.200
 I mean, it's also like with Ray Dalio, I feel like China will drive a lot of this either

1:43:48.200 --> 1:43:54.160
 in response or directly, I mean, I think the ruble, I'm not paying as close attention

1:43:54.160 --> 1:44:00.040
 to the financial systems, but I think they're trying to tie it to gold once again.

1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:04.800
 So that's an interesting, maybe it'll be one of the more authoritarian regime that will

1:44:04.800 --> 1:44:08.040
 switch to Bitcoin standard first.

1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:16.520
 And then it's the West that will, out of that pressure will catch up versus the other

1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:17.520
 way around.

1:44:17.520 --> 1:44:24.720
 And it's fascinating to think of what is the forcing function, what kind of perturbation

1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:28.720
 is required to switch, to change anything, honestly, about the financial system.

1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:35.120
 But it could be, as you're saying, just waiting for the people that are young now that are

1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:41.080
 embracing crypto to enter the positions of power, essentially.

1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:47.480
 But I hope that's not the case because that's a, if for any innovation, we have to wait,

1:44:47.480 --> 1:44:51.960
 sorry to say, for the older folk to pass away.

1:44:51.960 --> 1:44:54.840
 That's not an efficient way to make change.

1:44:54.840 --> 1:44:55.840
 Yeah.

1:44:55.840 --> 1:45:02.920
 That's a super interesting topic of how people's minds become less plastic as they age.

1:45:02.920 --> 1:45:05.080
 I guess it's the future.

1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:06.640
 It's called wisdom.

1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:12.320
 But then we also need the wild ones to explore exploration versus exploitation.

1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:17.960
 We wrote a blog post that's really interesting in September, 2020 titled Coinbase is a mission

1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:20.760
 focused company, like what we're talking about.

1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:27.480
 So one interesting thing you said in that blog post is that we're not going to be distracted

1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:35.240
 by sort of activism within the company that's not related to the mission of the company.

1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:40.960
 Now that's a rare thing for a company to state, for companies here at the state, especially

1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:50.440
 in this climate, can you, first of all, describe in a little more detail what you meant?

1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:52.800
 Did you receive blowback for this?

1:45:52.800 --> 1:45:55.240
 Definitely received some blowback, but yeah, I'll describe what I meant.

1:45:55.240 --> 1:45:58.480
 And if you want to talk about how it came to that too, we can talk about that.

1:45:58.480 --> 1:46:05.520
 But what I meant is that there's a lot of companies right now, including tech companies,

1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:12.720
 but not exclusively where I think like great companies, they have an important mission.

1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:15.520
 They're trying to do something really good for the world.

1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:20.080
 And unfortunately, they're getting a little distracted from that at times because of employee

1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:27.120
 activism that is causing the company to basically jump into whatever the current thing is and

1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:31.680
 try to help is like the positive interpretation, you know, the negative interpretation would

1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:33.880
 be to virtue signal.

1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:39.560
 And my view is that this is actually kind of destructive to, this is largely an American

1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:45.760
 company phenomenon, by the way, I do worry that this is making America less competitive,

1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:48.360
 even though I think of myself as kind of internationally minded, but you know, I am

1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:51.280
 a US citizen, have a lot of my whole life here.

1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:56.360
 So, when we put out this statement, we had employees that were not in the US who were

1:46:56.360 --> 1:46:57.360
 confused by it.

1:46:57.360 --> 1:46:59.520
 They were like, why did Brian need to say that?

1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:02.600
 We're just saying you're going to focus on work at work.

1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:04.720
 That's what we were doing already.

1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:10.160
 And there was certain pockets of the US, certain cities, you know, in particular, we had employees

1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:18.520
 that a very peculiar cultural phenomenon had evolved where I think people really wanted

1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:25.120
 the company they worked at to be, you know, almost acting like the government or something

1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:30.480
 and like trying to solve the hardest societal issues and at least have an opinion on it,

1:47:30.480 --> 1:47:35.600
 if not contribute to the solution on almost everything.

1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:39.840
 And for me, I kind of, you know, I was, it was a very uncomfortable situation for me

1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:40.840
 as a CEO.

1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:45.000
 I'd never quite been in this situation where most of the time when employees in the past

1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:49.840
 were kind of asking me questions, they would be asking about like, you know, how do we

1:47:49.840 --> 1:47:50.840
 make this product better?

1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:52.440
 Like, what do we do with this competitor?

1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:54.840
 What about this regulator?

1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:59.560
 And it got to a place around that time where most of the questions we were receiving were,

1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:03.200
 I think even about things not related to the company, they were about broader societal issues

1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:07.040
 like, Brian, what's your stance on XYZ controversial thing?

1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:12.040
 And you know, it was, I often like didn't have an opinion on these really hard questions,

1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:13.040
 right?

1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:16.040
 And I didn't really, I felt like it was distracting the company.

1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:19.640
 People internally were getting into fights a lot to like disagreeing with each other.

1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:24.080
 There was a thing where like the social slack internally was turning into social media almost

1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:26.440
 with people putting in flame wars.

1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:32.640
 So in this culminated, by the way, with a walkout that happened in the company, we received

1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:35.560
 like some demands from employee groups about various things.

1:48:35.560 --> 1:48:39.280
 And there was like basically an antagonistic thing with management and employee, and I

1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:42.240
 was like, we're all on the same team here.

1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:45.760
 If you want to be antagonistic, let's do it with somebody else outside the company,

1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:48.520
 you know, that we're trying to improve the world in that dimension.

1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:53.680
 So yeah, eventually I was like, okay, the company is not aligned on this.

1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:58.240
 I just don't feel, I don't like the job as CEO, frankly, like if the job is to come in

1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:04.080
 here every day and like have to squirm in front of like the most difficult societal questions,

1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:05.400
 I don't think I want to do that job.

1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:08.360
 So like either they're going to have to go or I'm going to have to go.

1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:10.360
 And I founded this company and I really believe in the mission.

1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:11.600
 So they're going to have to go.

1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:17.160
 And what I realized was that, so I basically, I made an exit package available to anybody

1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:21.120
 who wasn't on board with this direction, 5% of employees took it.

1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:23.960
 I got the company realigned towards this mission.

1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:24.960
 We're all here to do work.

1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:29.440
 By the way, people can, they can go do anything like political or social activism outside

1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:30.440
 of work.

1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:31.440
 It's totally fine.

1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:34.360
 Like we all, everybody has stuff like that in their personal life.

1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:37.640
 But while at work, we can also disagree at work, by the way, on the work.

1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:39.840
 You know, this is not like a no disagreement culture.

1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:44.640
 Like we should, let's try to get the truth, but don't bring stuff into work that's just

1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:49.120
 going to create division, make the workplace a refuge from division about all these crazy

1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:50.120
 things.

1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:51.840
 We're all aligned here to work on the mission.

1:49:51.840 --> 1:49:52.840
 Let's do that.

1:49:52.840 --> 1:49:53.840
 Yeah.

1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:57.360
 That was really, really, really refreshing to hear.

1:49:57.360 --> 1:50:03.440
 So this is me speaking, but there's a sense when companies take on these issues publicly

1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:10.880
 from a CEO position or anywhere else, that it does seem to optimize for virtue signaling

1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:13.800
 versus solving a particular problem.

1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:18.920
 Because to solve a particular problem, you really have to really put in a huge, you have

1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:20.560
 to hire a huge number.

1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:25.520
 You basically have to create a company with a company to take on a particular thing.

1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:31.200
 But if you allow yourself to internally care about a particular issue, you're basically

1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:37.080
 pacifying some number of employee, like making sure a Slack doesn't get out of hand.

1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:41.280
 And then you're doing this kind of, from my perspective, especially on issues that care

1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:47.280
 about fake virtue signaling, basically trying to understand what will make me look the best,

1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:50.400
 what will make the company look the best in this particular aspect.

1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:55.640
 And it just seems very shallow and it's optimizing for the wrong thing, not for the solving of

1:50:55.640 --> 1:51:02.080
 the problems, but for the making yourself look like the good guy.

1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:07.680
 And trying to then leverage that to say, I'm the good guy in all situations.

1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:09.920
 And it's just, it's the wrong thing.

1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:16.800
 And perhaps from your perspective as a CEO, as a leader, it's also creating division,

1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:19.440
 unnecessary division within people.

1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:25.000
 Like they get, yeah, there's something about us who gets extremely argumentative about

1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:26.000
 certain topics.

1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.840
 They really bring out the emotion.

1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:34.200
 And I think that probably as you were saying, that emotion is even probably okay, maybe

1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:37.760
 productive when that emotion has to do with the mission of the company.

1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:43.840
 Like you really care about those disagreements versus like something that has nothing to do

1:51:43.840 --> 1:51:50.720
 with the particular, with increasing economic freedom using crypto.

1:51:50.720 --> 1:51:54.920
 Yeah, it's fascinating, but it was so refreshing because it's rare.

1:51:54.920 --> 1:52:00.440
 Why do you think that's a rare, so the city you're mentioning, I mean, there's a bunch

1:52:00.440 --> 1:52:07.760
 of cities, but San Francisco is one such city when that culture.

1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:16.640
 And it's sad because San Francisco is also the Bay Area is also the hub historically

1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:20.720
 of some of the greatest innovation in human history.

1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:22.120
 So there's that tension.

1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:27.440
 How did that culture emerge there where like the innovation was done by people that are

1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:32.720
 very mission driven, you get a bunch of smart people together to solve a difficult problem.

1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:38.280
 They get maybe sometimes too much blinders on, but they try to balance that because it

1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:41.520
 requires that focus to solve an actual problem.

1:52:41.520 --> 1:52:44.320
 And yet that's also the place where this culture emerged.

1:52:44.320 --> 1:52:46.720
 It's a fascinating human dynamic.

1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:48.200
 I don't know.

1:52:48.200 --> 1:52:54.400
 Somebody will one day tell the history of Silicon Valley, not just the innovation, but

1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:56.320
 the social dynamics that occurred there.

1:52:56.320 --> 1:52:58.920
 Anyway, why do you think that's so rare?

1:52:58.920 --> 1:53:04.240
 Well, because people don't want to get attacked, you don't want to get canceled.

1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:07.880
 It's super uncomfortable.

1:53:07.880 --> 1:53:12.420
 Nobody wants to be called a racist or whatever people want to say on Twitter.

1:53:12.420 --> 1:53:13.420
 So

1:53:13.420 --> 1:53:14.420
 Did you get attacked?

1:53:14.420 --> 1:53:15.420
 Yeah.

1:53:15.420 --> 1:53:16.420
 Yeah, I definitely got attacked.

1:53:16.420 --> 1:53:18.000
 And I knew it would be controversial.

1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:22.520
 The only reason I did it, frankly, was that I was kind of at my wit's end.

1:53:22.520 --> 1:53:27.080
 I was like, well, like I said earlier, the CEO job sucks.

1:53:27.080 --> 1:53:30.360
 Either I don't want to do it or they have to go and I'm going to make the company into

1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:31.560
 something that I want.

1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:37.280
 And I'd spent eight or nine years in my life at that point kind of building this thing.

1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:40.560
 I was like, well, I could go start another company, but it takes a long time to get momentum

1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:41.560
 with these things.

1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:44.400
 And Coinbase is a very rare thing that happened in the world.

1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:46.240
 I feel very passionate about it.

1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:49.120
 So yeah, I'm not going to go.

1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:51.080
 I need to make this the company that I want to work at.

1:53:51.080 --> 1:53:56.840
 And what was really interesting was that there was such a huge outpouring of support.

1:53:56.840 --> 1:53:59.280
 So I knew that it would be controversial and I would get attacked.

1:53:59.280 --> 1:54:03.960
 And predictably, you know, there was some journalists and, you know, New York Times

1:54:03.960 --> 1:54:07.960
 and all these people who kind of like went and started writing hit pieces on the company

1:54:07.960 --> 1:54:09.480
 after shortly thereafter.

1:54:09.480 --> 1:54:13.600
 And they basically just call people who've left the company and like, you know, can get

1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:14.720
 quotes on whatever they want.

1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:16.400
 And then they'll write a story.

1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:20.000
 So mainstream media, I lost a lot of trust in mainstream media, frankly, after that.

1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:24.800
 And of course, it's kind of become obvious since then that most mainstream media is like

1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:26.600
 hyper politicized at this point.

1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:28.600
 It's basically either super left or super right.

1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:33.160
 And it's not really that focused on truth.

1:54:33.160 --> 1:54:37.040
 So that's that's kind of unfortunate because I think journalism is actually like really

1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:38.040
 important in society.

1:54:38.040 --> 1:54:42.360
 So that that whole thing got eroded in the U.S. Luckily, there's sort of new media people

1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:44.800
 like you and a whole bunch of people.

1:54:44.800 --> 1:54:50.680
 Did that blog post help that statement, the 95 people that remained?

1:54:50.680 --> 1:54:52.840
 Is this still something you struggle with?

1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:56.760
 Because there it's also culture, the broader tech space.

1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:00.880
 Okay, so that was an interesting thing, which was that so the 95% of people stayed, I got

1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:06.640
 a huge outpouring of support from people who said, thank God, you finally spoke up and

1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:12.440
 said something because frankly, it was making it not a very fun place to work either.

1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:17.880
 And I realized that there is, I think there was a, I think is it in the seem to lab has

1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:22.820
 this blog post about the tyranny of the, the 1% or something like that, but there's basically

1:55:22.820 --> 1:55:28.480
 a relatively small group, one 5% or something like that, that is really upset about something.

1:55:28.480 --> 1:55:29.680
 It's not the majority of the company.

1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:30.920
 It's like 5%.

1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:34.480
 There's another 15% or something that are sympathetic to the cause.

1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:36.160
 They're actually somewhat suggestible.

1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:39.040
 They will go along with whatever because it sounds reasonable, you know, these are like

1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:40.400
 real issues they're talking about.

1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:45.000
 It's not not to say that it's not real and they'll kind of get swept up in it.

1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:50.080
 But there's an 80% of the company that basically doesn't agree or just wants to get their work

1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:55.880
 done without all this drama and or distraction and they're afraid to speak up because if

1:55:55.880 --> 1:56:01.040
 they speak up, they're afraid of being again, called a racist, like fired, you know, ostracized

1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:02.040
 amongst their peers.

1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:07.760
 And so it did require it to get to a bad enough place for me to finally say, you know what,

1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:12.600
 I just, I feel like I have to do this, live through the short term attacks of the press,

1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:16.840
 which ultimately was very freeing for me because now I don't really care and now I can actually

1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:20.800
 just build the company that I want to build without like caring about that.

1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:25.240
 So and then what was cool was a lot of really great people reached out to the Coinbase too

1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:26.240
 after that.

1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:31.280
 And we're like, I, you know, I'm an early engineer at Google or wherever and like this

1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:34.560
 culture has gotten kind of messed up and like, I want to work at a company that's willing

1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:35.560
 to stand for that.

1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:38.760
 And so we've gotten a lot of good people come over basically what I realized and by the

1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:42.080
 way, our diversity numbers and all that stuff, like people told me when I was drafting this

1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:46.800
 post or like, don't post this, like people, underrepresented groups will never want to

1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:47.800
 work at this company again.

1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:49.840
 And I was like, I don't think that's true.

1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:54.240
 Like I talked to like our ERG groups and they're not telling me they care about this stuff

1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:55.240
 that much.

1:56:55.240 --> 1:56:58.920
 They're telling me they just want to like be respected at work and do good work and contribute.

1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:01.760
 So my gut was telling me that that advice was wrong.

1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:06.480
 And like, I can tell you a year, a year after doing it, like our diversity numbers are basically

1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:08.920
 either the same or better in every category.

1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:12.440
 So that turned out to be false.

1:57:12.440 --> 1:57:17.320
 Look, I hate to be like a, like I'm, you know, polarizing on in either dimension here.

1:57:17.320 --> 1:57:20.080
 Like I just want to get good work done and build good stuff with technology.

1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:25.640
 So, you know, I think companies should just have like reasonable policies.

1:57:25.640 --> 1:57:27.360
 Like you want to get rid of bias and hiring.

1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:30.640
 You want to attract great people from all different backgrounds.

1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:34.960
 Like, you know, we have pledged 1%, we put 1% of the company equity into a foundation.

1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:36.960
 Like I hope we're able to do good stuff with that.

1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:42.920
 Because, you know, give back in some way, but like the main, the main message, I guess,

1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:47.840
 for me is like the core, the core mission, the core work that we're doing on economic

1:57:47.840 --> 1:57:51.760
 freedom and just all of our products are, that is like the main value that we're contributing

1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:52.760
 in the world.

1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:56.440
 Like let's just do that more and hopefully we can get from 89 million verified users

1:57:56.440 --> 1:57:58.240
 to a billion or whatever.

1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:02.560
 And then I just think that's how we'll have the biggest impact.

1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:03.560
 It's tempting though.

1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:06.240
 It's so interesting how companies get tempted to help.

1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:07.240
 Yeah.

1:58:07.240 --> 1:58:11.880
 It's like, and you step in and it's almost like a drug and then you can't, you forget,

1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:16.240
 I mean, like all of us in life, it doesn't have to be companies, you get distracted.

1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:17.240
 Yeah.

1:58:17.240 --> 1:58:18.240
 And maintaining focus.

1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:19.800
 Like, you're absolutely right.

1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:25.680
 The way for Coinbase to add value to the world is to maximize the mission that it's on.

1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:26.680
 Not other stuff.

1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:32.360
 And when you get wealthier, more successful, it becomes more and more tempting to just

1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:34.480
 help out in some other shallow ways.

1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:35.480
 It's fascinating.

1:58:35.480 --> 1:58:37.560
 And you just kind of brought that to light.

1:58:37.560 --> 1:58:42.520
 So it was very refreshing and it shouldn't be controversial to sort of focus on just

1:58:42.520 --> 1:58:43.520
 getting stuff done.

1:58:43.520 --> 1:58:44.520
 Yeah.

1:58:44.520 --> 1:58:47.720
 Well, let me ask you, I mean, do you think that this, it's, all these things tie together.

1:58:47.720 --> 1:58:50.160
 There's like a general trend of like more censorship.

1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:54.400
 You know, there's like more cancel culture.

1:58:54.400 --> 1:58:59.800
 There's some of these like freedom values are kind of, you know, even like freezing

1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:02.680
 people's accounts, like the trucker thing that happened.

1:59:02.680 --> 1:59:10.120
 And this seems like there's a general trend of more authoritarian, you know, policies

1:59:10.120 --> 1:59:11.120
 there.

1:59:11.120 --> 1:59:14.000
 But do you think that, do you feel like the tide is turning on that?

1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:15.400
 Like there's counter examples to it.

1:59:15.400 --> 1:59:16.400
 We've seen recently.

1:59:16.400 --> 1:59:17.400
 Yeah.

1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:20.960
 I think it's the last gasp of old way of doing things.

1:59:20.960 --> 1:59:27.320
 And so there's desperation and so on because to be fair, it's kind of the internet, which

1:59:27.320 --> 1:59:32.760
 is where is the source of a lot of this, where people have a voice is making the power centers

1:59:32.760 --> 1:59:34.040
 of the world really nervous.

1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:36.960
 And so that's where that's coming from, I think.

1:59:36.960 --> 1:59:39.160
 And the internet is tricky.

1:59:39.160 --> 1:59:40.160
 It's weird.

1:59:40.160 --> 1:59:41.160
 It's full of bots.

1:59:41.160 --> 1:59:42.160
 Yeah.

1:59:42.160 --> 1:59:48.320
 It's full of like misinformation of all kinds, full of large groups with conspiracy theories

1:59:48.320 --> 1:59:49.960
 and so on.

1:59:49.960 --> 1:59:51.840
 And I mean misinformation broadly.

1:59:51.840 --> 1:59:53.880
 People are misusing the word misinformation.

1:59:53.880 --> 1:59:58.040
 It's just that governments are just labeling random things with misinformation just to

1:59:58.040 --> 2:00:00.200
 censor them.

2:00:00.200 --> 2:00:05.320
 But I just think it's just like a new world where the internet is really finally taking

2:00:05.320 --> 2:00:09.680
 hold where there's billions of devices and everybody has a voice.

2:00:09.680 --> 2:00:18.520
 It's almost basically governments and powerful people are slightly losing hold of power and

2:00:18.520 --> 2:00:20.680
 they're starting to freak out a little bit.

2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:21.680
 That's it.

2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:28.080
 Yeah, so once you have young people that are coming up now, gain power, I think will rebalance

2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:29.080
 everything.

2:00:29.080 --> 2:00:35.640
 And then there's, yeah, like you said, promising signs that it's obvious that the majority

2:00:35.640 --> 2:00:38.360
 of people want freedom.

2:00:38.360 --> 2:00:39.480
 And that means a lot of things.

2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:45.880
 That means economic freedom, that means freedom to have a voice, freedom to move around, freedom

2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:54.120
 to act in a way without reasonable sort of limitations by people that don't have their

2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:55.120
 best interests.

2:00:55.120 --> 2:01:06.520
 And I gain more hope from just regular people that are fighting and like demanding the being

2:01:06.520 --> 2:01:14.560
 able to have freedom of speech or more specifically sort of resisting crude overreach of government

2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:19.880
 in the acts of censorship, at least in the United States.

2:01:19.880 --> 2:01:24.200
 And hopefully that percolates out to the rest of the world that's struggling on a much more

2:01:24.200 --> 2:01:28.880
 basic level where people are being put in prison for the words they say, not just banned

2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:29.880
 from Twitter.

2:01:29.880 --> 2:01:30.880
 Right.

2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:31.880
 It could be worse.

2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:39.000
 What are some lessons from your failures and your successes about what it takes to run

2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:40.000
 a company?

2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:46.320
 I think one of the things that I've learned about leadership is that, you know, I never

2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:48.800
 really thought of myself as a very natural leader, to be honest.

2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:53.960
 I don't think I was a natural leader, but so I always envisioned, you know, good leaders

2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:57.880
 as like these military generals, like they seem so like confident and they're just like

2:01:57.880 --> 2:02:00.320
 bark orders, you know, like charge that hill and do this.

2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:06.800
 And I was, I was actually like more introverted and kind of, I wasn't really confident in

2:02:06.800 --> 2:02:09.400
 the way I communicated and, you know.

2:02:09.400 --> 2:02:13.200
 And so what I realized is that there's lots of different kinds of leaders.

2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:15.000
 You can be any kind of CEO you want, right?

2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:18.280
 I was kind of more of like a product technical focus CEO.

2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:22.880
 And I preferred to sort of hear everyone's opinion and it wasn't just going to like render

2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:26.240
 a decision in the room in some like kind of heated moment and like piss off half the people.

2:02:26.240 --> 2:02:30.240
 I would be like, all right, I'm going to go think about it and I'll send you my decision

2:02:30.240 --> 2:02:32.240
 later today or tomorrow or whatever.

2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:37.640
 And so I found ways to kind of make it work for me where I could basically, I always tried

2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:42.880
 to avoid like, you know, when people getting like super emotional about something and like

2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:46.600
 I think they're, they're thinking their judgment goes down, right?

2:02:46.600 --> 2:02:48.600
 And it's like never make a decision when you're angry, right?

2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:51.880
 And so if I would always sort of try to get a sense of, are these people like trying to

2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:56.360
 be right or are they trying to seek the truth, you know, and you can do these little tricks

2:02:56.360 --> 2:03:01.240
 like, you know, okay, you argue that person's position and you argue the other one and like

2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:02.920
 see if you can genuinely represent it.

2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:06.360
 Now I know you're listening and, you know, these kind of things.

2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:08.520
 But I guess, sorry, getting back to your question about leadership.

2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:15.080
 I think I basically just kept doing things that were a little outside my comfort zone

2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:18.640
 and then my comfort zone kept getting bigger and bigger, you know?

2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:24.760
 And so that's, I think that's how you build confidence is you do the thing that's scary

2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:29.760
 and it's like a little outside and like when I first started Coinbase, I had never managed

2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:30.760
 anybody.

2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:33.000
 I would have, I would have never, I would have been scared to death to have put out like

2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:38.200
 a very controversial opinion like that and sort of, all right, 5% of people will go,

2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:40.200
 you know, we didn't know what percent it was going to be, by the way, it could have been

2:03:40.200 --> 2:03:45.200
 1%, it could have been 50%, like, but we went into it scary because it was a scary thing.

2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:49.520
 I was like, I don't know, I think this is right, I'm just going to do it.

2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:53.040
 So if you do, if you do enough scary things, like you'll build the confidence.

2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:57.200
 And I feel like I'm still on that journey every, every year or two at Coinbase, there's

2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:00.520
 some big thing that comes out as like, oh my God, like I didn't sleep well for a week

2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:03.680
 and like, this is the next level, right?

2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:05.720
 But that's how you, that's how you learn and grow.

2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:09.440
 So you're still going up that mountain through the fog one step at a time.

2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:10.440
 Yeah.

2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:15.120
 Can I just quickly ask you about a couple other efforts that are super interesting that

2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:16.120
 you're involved with?

2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:22.520
 So first of all, a little bit more old school, fascinating effort of research hub.

2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:24.360
 So what, what's that about?

2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:26.560
 The GitHub for open science.

2:04:26.560 --> 2:04:27.560
 Yeah.

2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:28.560
 Okay.

2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:31.080
 So there's a chance to try to help a couple other companies get off the ground too, because

2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:34.760
 I want to see various efforts out there succeed.

2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:40.240
 And one of them, I've always thought about like, why is scientific research not more

2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:42.800
 like open source software or why couldn't it be much faster, right?

2:04:42.800 --> 2:04:46.160
 And there's, you've probably have seen this like in an academic setting, right?

2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:50.760
 But there's all kinds of things that feel very antiquated to me about scientific research,

2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:56.920
 everything from the funding process and grants to how peer review works, to how you submit

2:04:56.920 --> 2:05:01.520
 to journals, all the costs associated with journals, you know, the people, you'd think

2:05:01.520 --> 2:05:04.320
 like you'd get paid for this or something and it would then be available to all the

2:05:04.320 --> 2:05:05.320
 taxpayers for free.

2:05:05.320 --> 2:05:08.200
 But no, they're like, they're all paywalled and there's like these big companies that

2:05:08.200 --> 2:05:12.160
 have sort of, in my view, kind of held back innovation here.

2:05:12.160 --> 2:05:16.720
 So and the preprint servers like bio archive and archive.org have really helped this,

2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:20.360
 but those websites are, they look like they're kind of from like 15 years ago or something.

2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:21.360
 Yeah.

2:05:21.360 --> 2:05:22.360
 It's like Craigslist or something.

2:05:22.360 --> 2:05:23.360
 Yeah.

2:05:23.360 --> 2:05:26.600
 So anyway, I, one of the things I, once, once Coinbase went public last year, I had a little

2:05:26.600 --> 2:05:29.280
 bit of liquidity and I was like, all right, let me find a small team and let's see if

2:05:29.280 --> 2:05:32.800
 we can, if they can like go off and make something better here.

2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:35.240
 So we have a, we have a prototype out there.

2:05:35.240 --> 2:05:36.480
 It's at research hub.com.

2:05:36.480 --> 2:05:37.480
 People can check it out.

2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:41.680
 And it's basically, you know, the first version is kind of like Reddit for science.

2:05:41.680 --> 2:05:46.280
 There's like various hubs, which are like journals, but, you know, you can publish papers

2:05:46.280 --> 2:05:47.280
 there.

2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:50.200
 You can use an electronic lab notebook to sort of have a modern day paper, which is not

2:05:50.200 --> 2:05:54.520
 just a PDF that's static, but it's a living document, ideally in the future, you know,

2:05:54.520 --> 2:05:56.700
 you can get comments and feedback from people on there.

2:05:56.700 --> 2:05:58.080
 You can update it over time.

2:05:58.080 --> 2:06:02.360
 We want people to be able to share the code and the data sets associated with their paper,

2:06:02.360 --> 2:06:04.160
 research papers, not just a PDF.

2:06:04.160 --> 2:06:09.280
 And in the future, we want to make it even where like, you know, people can get funding

2:06:09.280 --> 2:06:13.920
 for science through that, through that site and even license out innovations that they've

2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:14.920
 made.

2:06:14.920 --> 2:06:18.120
 Cause the other thing I've noticed in life is that there's kind of like a, there's a

2:06:18.120 --> 2:06:21.280
 bunch of people working on science and there's a bunch of people building companies and they

2:06:21.280 --> 2:06:25.960
 very rarely, very rarely intersect, but when they do, you get the best things like, like

2:06:25.960 --> 2:06:31.080
 SpaceX and Genentech and even Google and like even Coinbase was based on a research paper,

2:06:31.080 --> 2:06:32.600
 the Bitcoin white paper.

2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:36.920
 And so most business people are like creating companies that don't have any scientific innovation.

2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:40.360
 They're just like marketing based on, you know, whatever.

2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:44.880
 And then a lot of scientists are making things which never actually benefit humanity because

2:06:44.880 --> 2:06:47.640
 they're not commercialized and turned into products.

2:06:47.640 --> 2:06:53.400
 And so if we can somehow create a translation layer between those two groups and help them,

2:06:53.400 --> 2:06:58.320
 you know, help align the market forces, align scientific research to market forces so that

2:06:58.320 --> 2:06:59.320
 they're more incentivized.

2:06:59.320 --> 2:07:03.000
 Like if you, if you discover CRISPR or something like that, like you should be a billionaire,

2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:06.840
 you know, and like all the downstream implications of that, not going through some antiquated

2:07:06.840 --> 2:07:08.760
 tech transfer office or whatever.

2:07:08.760 --> 2:07:12.600
 And if you, and if you're an entrepreneur, you should be looking to commercialize the

2:07:12.600 --> 2:07:14.840
 latest scientific innovations.

2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:18.680
 And so that's kind of like the longterm vision for that site.

2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:22.160
 I think it's just an early step today, but we've got like a really passionate community

2:07:22.160 --> 2:07:28.800
 on there that are jumping into like, you know, computer science or longevity or various

2:07:28.800 --> 2:07:30.280
 biohubs or whatever.

2:07:30.280 --> 2:07:35.360
 And like beginning to source the best innovations, but also discuss them, improve them and publish

2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:36.360
 through the site.

2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:40.680
 So I have a question about incentives, but first let me say for people listening outside

2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:44.400
 of academia might not be familiar with an absurd situation.

2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:52.640
 So there's journals, like you mentioned, and scientists publishing those journals, and

2:07:52.640 --> 2:08:01.920
 the journals provide very little value except matching you with reviewers that are unpaid.

2:08:01.920 --> 2:08:08.280
 And so in the digital world, they're providing basically almost no value except hosting your

2:08:08.280 --> 2:08:10.640
 paper.

2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:15.720
 And they put up a paywall and charge people to access that.

2:08:15.720 --> 2:08:18.560
 And that charge is not like even Netflix fees.

2:08:18.560 --> 2:08:20.960
 You're talking about a lot of money.

2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:27.240
 So they're basically blocking your research that should be wide open from the world and

2:08:27.240 --> 2:08:28.480
 creating a paywall.

2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:32.800
 It's a fascinating like scam that's actually holding back.

2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:36.400
 I don't, it's a shitty scam because you're not making that much money.

2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:41.600
 I feel like a definition of a scam, you should at least be making money, so like significant

2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:42.600
 amount of money.

2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:46.920
 You're basically making shady money and holding back all of human knowledge.

2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:52.320
 So that put aside, and people get a little confused because the journals aren't the ones

2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:53.600
 paying the scientists.

2:08:53.600 --> 2:08:59.400
 People think like the journals are somehow funding the scientists, therefore, they have

2:08:59.400 --> 2:09:01.080
 the right to put up a paywall.

2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:02.080
 No, no, no.

2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:03.840
 The funding is coming from elsewhere.

2:09:03.840 --> 2:09:08.880
 The journals are the middleman that nobody asks for, especially in the digital world.

2:09:08.880 --> 2:09:15.440
 Anyway, that said, there is interesting kind of incentives for scientists, which is prestige

2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:16.440
 and so on.

2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:24.600
 So there's a thing with journals, if there's a prestigious journal and you pass the review

2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:30.520
 process, you get into that journal or a prestigious conference in computer science, then that's

2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:33.720
 seen as a good thing in your resume.

2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:37.480
 And not just your resume, within your community, that's a respected thing.

2:09:37.480 --> 2:09:44.160
 Is there some way to achieve that same kind of incentive in the open setting of Research

2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:45.160
 Hub?

2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:52.120
 So where I could say, I got X, Y, and Z, look, I'm impressive because this happened on Research

2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:53.120
 Hub.

2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:54.120
 I think you're right.

2:09:54.120 --> 2:10:00.120
 The whole academia progress track is about where you got published and how many citations.

2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:07.200
 It's kind of like a false economy of reputation because there's not real money backing it.

2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:11.440
 So I think we've thought about this a little bit, and I think the Research Hub team has

2:10:11.440 --> 2:10:17.000
 an opportunity to do something here that basically says, OK, I had the top paper for

2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:24.160
 2022 in biology on in here, and you basically publish a list, a leaderboards of these like

2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:30.520
 top for the month, the year in all these different categories, then actually, we should probably

2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:36.280
 give out grants and awards in addition to that, fund those people, almost like fellows

2:10:36.280 --> 2:10:40.160
 or even give out like the Nobel Prize.

2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:45.080
 There should be like a Research Hub prize or something and like ship people, maybe even

2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:50.360
 ship like a print version of a journal that is the top papers in each category in each

2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:51.360
 month or whatever.

2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:54.680
 And then people want to put that in their wall in the lab.

2:10:54.680 --> 2:11:00.280
 So I do think we need to change, I don't know, the traditional folks in academia or science

2:11:00.280 --> 2:11:04.480
 would probably think this is a crazy idea, but I think we need to change the culture

2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:10.920
 to not celebrate getting published in paywall journals, almost like friends don't let friends

2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:16.520
 publish in paywall journals because it's just not helping humanity.

2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:24.080
 So it should be more prestigious to publish in an open science way and get the top spot.

2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:27.200
 That should be celebrated above being published in whatever, I don't even want to name one

2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:28.200
 of them.

2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:32.440
 Well, there's currently, the culture has already shifted to where almost everybody

2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:36.600
 publishes an archive and buy archive and so on.

2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:40.880
 But so that the culture is there on that, that that's seen friends don't let friends

2:11:40.880 --> 2:11:46.360
 not publish open, but then the prestige thing is missing, which is like anyone can publish

2:11:46.360 --> 2:11:47.360
 an archive.

2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:48.360
 Yeah.

2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:50.120
 So how do you know it's actually a strong paper?

2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:56.760
 Now, funny enough, even with the crappy systems we have now, word of mouth is powerful.

2:11:56.760 --> 2:12:00.320
 Like you have a, like citation system is pretty powerful.

2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:05.440
 So like you say, okay, this is a strong paper, we don't need reviewers, our human eyes are

2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:08.560
 the reviewers, like the community is the reviewers.

2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:15.560
 So it's already, it's sort of like that part is there, but it would be nice to have like,

2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:22.360
 you know, nature level, like this is respect, this is a respectful accomplishment and something

2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:25.760
 like a leaderboard, but a stable kind of system.

2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:26.760
 Yeah.

2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:30.600
 And I should mention too, so there's a crypto angle to this too, which is, so research hub

2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:32.280
 has a coin associated with research coin.

2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:37.920
 And it's basically if people, you know, upvote your paper or like support it, you'll accumulate

2:12:37.920 --> 2:12:42.280
 more research coin, which is basically like rep or like a reward token.

2:12:42.280 --> 2:12:49.240
 And so that is a way to, I guess, measure the community's collective view of that paper,

2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:53.480
 a form of peer review, and it can even be weighted by like the reputation of the people

2:12:53.480 --> 2:12:56.160
 voting on it and that sort of thing over time.

2:12:56.160 --> 2:13:01.560
 Yeah, I think the last thing I'll just say is that, so I think from a rep, like a prestige

2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:06.520
 point of view, it won't start off that way, it'll probably start off like being a little

2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:11.040
 more quirky, like, you know, like, remember when YouTube first started, it was like people

2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:13.400
 posting weird cat videos and stuff.

2:13:13.400 --> 2:13:16.400
 And but now, like, you know, if you have a million subscribers on YouTube, that's probably

2:13:16.400 --> 2:13:21.080
 better than getting like a TV show on NBC or whoever the traditional gatekeeper was.

2:13:21.080 --> 2:13:25.680
 So my hope, it might take 10 years, 20 years, whatever, but I'm hoping that this can sort

2:13:25.680 --> 2:13:31.080
 of be the new prestigious way that young people publish in science, and it'll become to be

2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:32.520
 viewed as more prestigious.

2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:36.160
 The journals, traditional journals will be viewed as old fashioned.

2:13:36.160 --> 2:13:41.600
 Well, it's definitely a system that could do a lot better.

2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:45.840
 And there's a lot of incredible, brilliant people doing science, they deserve better,

2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:46.840
 the better platforms.

2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:47.840
 Yeah.

2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:52.280
 So another thing you're taking on and helping out with is this new limit, which is looking

2:13:52.280 --> 2:13:53.280
 at longevity.

2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:54.280
 Yeah.

2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:55.280
 What's the idea there?

2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:56.280
 Yeah.

2:13:56.280 --> 2:13:57.280
 Okay.

2:13:57.280 --> 2:13:58.280
 So as you can see, I'm excited about science.

2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:03.400
 Like, I think, you know, science is sort of the, basically, if you get scientific innovation,

2:14:03.400 --> 2:14:08.440
 then you get better products, and you get better economic growth, and then you get all

2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:13.080
 kinds of like surplus in society that can go to arts and philosophy and like all kinds

2:14:13.080 --> 2:14:14.080
 of stuff.

2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:15.760
 But with new limits.

2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:21.240
 So yeah, I kind of got, I started hosting some dinners with scientists last year, and

2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:24.800
 I was learning about all kinds of the latest stuff happening in bio.

2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:28.600
 And there's a lot of really cool stuff happening with like CAR T cells and CRISPR and all these

2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:29.600
 things.

2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:35.400
 Anyway, one of the topics I started to learn more about was something called cell reprogramming.

2:14:35.400 --> 2:14:40.400
 And you know, people maybe have heard of this induced pluripotent stem cells where you could

2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:43.600
 take like a skin cell and turn it back into a stem cell.

2:14:43.600 --> 2:14:49.360
 And Shinya Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize for this work that was done in 2006.

2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:51.800
 And you know, it's kind of a crazy thing.

2:14:51.800 --> 2:14:54.520
 You can turn one cell into another type of cell.

2:14:54.520 --> 2:15:01.840
 People recently have been experimenting with different types of transcription factors that

2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:05.640
 would either not, you don't want it to sell to go all the way back to being a stem cell.

2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:08.120
 You can end up getting like cancerous cells and things like that.

2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:13.600
 But you want it basically to the cell to revert a little bit earlier in its, you know, it

2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:15.040
 would call it the Waddington landscape.

2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:19.720
 But it's basically like, it'll go become act, start to act like a bit of a younger cell,

2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:23.240
 but not to de differentiate and become more like a stem cell.

2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:26.920
 And so I decided this might be an interesting area to go fund.

2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:30.760
 I think that that team has come together, that there's like some really talented people

2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:34.240
 who've come together to help get that off the ground and they're basically building

2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:39.680
 a platform that can test a lot of different transcription factors on different cell types

2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:44.880
 and hopefully find ways to rejuvenate different types of cells and tissues to extend human

2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:45.880
 health span.

2:15:45.880 --> 2:15:50.760
 I mean, the moonshot goal here, you know, the get to Mars is that there could be some

2:15:50.760 --> 2:15:55.080
 therapy here that in, I don't know, 10 or 20 years that you taken from a whole body

2:15:55.080 --> 2:16:00.280
 point of view is sort of rejuvenating tissue, not just one type of tissue like your immune

2:16:00.280 --> 2:16:04.160
 system, but eventually your whole body, maybe even your brain, so that, you know, we don't

2:16:04.160 --> 2:16:07.640
 have that issue where people who are older have trouble learning or they're more ossified

2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:10.080
 in their thinking.

2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:14.840
 To me, this is just, I always think about, you know, it's actually a little inspired

2:16:14.840 --> 2:16:15.840
 by Elon, right?

2:16:15.840 --> 2:16:19.400
 It's like, what are some of the biggest things in the world like that are probably high

2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:23.600
 technology risk, but if they did work, maybe they're kind of low chance of working, but

2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:25.960
 if they did work would have enormous impact.

2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:30.680
 I like the idea of trying hard tech problems, especially for people like founders like me

2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:34.080
 who've made some money in software, which I think we're in kind of like a golden age

2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:36.560
 of software, so there's like fortunes to be made.

2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:42.400
 But if you do make some money in that, my hope is people will like do atoms, not bits,

2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:47.160
 you know, and try some of the harder things like in biotech or, you know, I guess he's

2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:53.200
 doing cars and rockets and stuff, but anyway, I think we should try hard tech or, you know,

2:16:53.200 --> 2:16:57.920
 physical science problems as well and see if that can advance for team human.

2:16:57.920 --> 2:16:58.920
 Yeah.

2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:02.800
 So he's also doing bio with Neuralink.

2:17:02.800 --> 2:17:07.280
 And I feel like bio is tough because it's messy.

2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:08.360
 We don't understand it as well.

2:17:08.360 --> 2:17:09.480
 We don't understand it.

2:17:09.480 --> 2:17:16.400
 The risk is higher in terms of not the risk is higher, but like you have to deal with

2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:23.520
 the actual sort of, to get to human, to get to stuff where it could be therapies for actual

2:17:23.520 --> 2:17:29.680
 human bodies is tricky because you have to prove that it's safe.

2:17:29.680 --> 2:17:35.000
 It's effective, all those kinds of things with FDA, I mean, it's just, it's tricky.

2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:36.000
 It's very difficult.

2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:37.000
 Yeah.

2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:38.000
 It's a long journey.

2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:39.000
 I mean,

2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:43.480
 If I can give a quick plug, so yeah, I'm on the board at New Limit.

2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:47.040
 We're hiring talented scientists that are interested in the cellular programming space.

2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:50.600
 They don't necessarily have to be coming from like an aging background or anything like

2:17:50.600 --> 2:17:51.600
 that.

2:17:51.600 --> 2:17:52.600
 There's sort of a small group of people doing even something.

2:17:52.600 --> 2:17:54.280
 So this is a new thing.

2:17:54.280 --> 2:17:56.360
 This is a, is New Limit relatively new?

2:17:56.360 --> 2:17:57.360
 Yeah.

2:17:57.360 --> 2:17:58.360
 It's very new.

2:17:58.360 --> 2:18:00.760
 There's a, there's a small team today, just a handful of people.

2:18:00.760 --> 2:18:03.680
 And so we're, we're hiring more there.

2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:08.080
 If people are excited about that space, reach out and same thing for Research Hub.

2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:10.200
 There's a small team there that's really awesome.

2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:15.200
 That's doing more like software engineering, design, product, that kind of stuff.

2:18:15.200 --> 2:18:21.520
 What advice would you give if you put on your old wise sage hat?

2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:24.080
 What advice would you give to young people today?

2:18:24.080 --> 2:18:32.560
 High school, maybe undergrad and college, about life, so like career, having a career

2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:37.840
 that can be proud of or maybe a life that can be proud of.

2:18:37.840 --> 2:18:40.520
 So people can do whatever they want to be happy, right?

2:18:40.520 --> 2:18:42.360
 So there's not one way to do it.

2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:46.880
 I do think that some people, a particular type of people out there, a lot of people

2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:48.640
 actually, they want to have an impact on the world.

2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:51.040
 That's how they get a sense of fulfillment, right?

2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:55.120
 So I mean, you need to have like health, physical health, you need to have good relationships.

2:18:55.120 --> 2:18:58.440
 Like there's lots of things, but most people want to do something important.

2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:02.760
 They want to have fulfilling work, a way that they can feel like they're contributing.

2:19:02.760 --> 2:19:07.600
 I think a lot of people, young people today are, are thinking like, you know, I should

2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:09.840
 be an activist or something like that.

2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:12.960
 And there's people in the world who have power and I, and I don't, a lot of people who don't,

2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:13.960
 I don't have power.

2:19:13.960 --> 2:19:19.840
 And so the way to change the world is to, you know, speak truth to power or like criticize

2:19:19.840 --> 2:19:25.440
 power and try to pressure them to change.

2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:28.800
 To me, I don't think that's the right way to, to actually have an impact on the world

2:19:28.800 --> 2:19:35.080
 because, you know, everybody has probably, I think people have more power than they,

2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:36.080
 than they realize.

2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:39.600
 And by the way, it's easy to be a critic.

2:19:39.600 --> 2:19:42.280
 It's hard to actually change these things and fix it.

2:19:42.280 --> 2:19:46.040
 And so you'll get a lot of accolades from friends and things like that.

2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:49.960
 If you kind of go around criticizing, you know, it's easy to do like everything is broken

2:19:49.960 --> 2:19:56.080
 and could be better, including, you know, stuff I'm working on, I, I find like so frustrating.

2:19:56.080 --> 2:20:01.360
 The million things I want to be better about like what we're doing in Coinbase.

2:20:01.360 --> 2:20:05.760
 So be, be the person in the arena, you know, like that Theodore Roosevelt quote, I think

2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:10.280
 he said it right, like go chew glass and stare into the abyss.

2:20:10.280 --> 2:20:14.680
 Like if, if you really want to have an impact, either join a company that has a mission that

2:20:14.680 --> 2:20:17.880
 is trying to fix the thing you're passionate about, or start, start that company if it

2:20:17.880 --> 2:20:22.800
 doesn't exist, or start a charity, if, if it's not suitable to be a company or whatever

2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:25.920
 it is, but go try to be a part of the solution.

2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:30.400
 Don't just, you know, criticize or be a part of the problem.

2:20:30.400 --> 2:20:38.640
 My hope is that more people can, you know, realize that they, they actually can have

2:20:38.640 --> 2:20:39.960
 a meaningful impact that way.

2:20:39.960 --> 2:20:44.640
 And I think that to me, technology is actually one of the most important ways to improve

2:20:44.640 --> 2:20:45.640
 the world.

2:20:45.640 --> 2:20:51.960
 Like if, if you look at climate change, like a lot of the best ideas like carbon sequestration,

2:20:51.960 --> 2:20:53.640
 all these things, it's a technology thing, right?

2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:57.640
 If you want to try to fix education, it's like, look at like Khan Academy and all the

2:20:57.640 --> 2:20:58.640
 stuff going online.

2:20:58.640 --> 2:21:00.640
 Right?

2:21:00.640 --> 2:21:04.560
 If you want to, if you want to fix, you know, whatever, transportation and like the financial

2:21:04.560 --> 2:21:09.080
 system and global freedom and like equality of all these things, like there's typically

2:21:09.080 --> 2:21:13.360
 the way to get something changed in the world today is with technology.

2:21:13.360 --> 2:21:16.960
 And so I do think people, it's very bizarre to me that there's this kind of like anti

2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:18.760
 tech thing going on.

2:21:18.760 --> 2:21:20.600
 Look, no, nothing is perfect.

2:21:20.600 --> 2:21:23.800
 Like if you create something new and like tens of millions of people use it or billions

2:21:23.800 --> 2:21:27.080
 people use it, it's like, there's going to be some bad people who use it too.

2:21:27.080 --> 2:21:32.080
 Okay, and there's, you know, society is complicated, but like, I think most of these things have

2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:36.360
 been net positive because most people in the world are good is at least my view.

2:21:36.360 --> 2:21:41.120
 So yes, we can mitigate like the 1% of bad people trying to, you know, abuse something,

2:21:41.120 --> 2:21:42.800
 but 99% of people in the world are good.

2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:46.400
 And the way you can improve the world is with technology, joining companies, starting companies

2:21:46.400 --> 2:21:48.320
 that are working on the right stuff.

2:21:48.320 --> 2:21:53.680
 So I hope, I hope more young people do that and just, if you're not sure what to do, like

2:21:53.680 --> 2:21:55.000
 just get started with anything.

2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:56.000
 That's how you learn.

2:21:56.000 --> 2:22:00.360
 And basically have the optimism that you have the power to do the change.

2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:06.400
 So it's easy to distract yourself by being the critic.

2:22:06.400 --> 2:22:10.720
 That's almost like acknowledging to yourself that that's all you can be.

2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:16.160
 But basically everybody has the power to be the fixer.

2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:21.880
 I like chew glass and look into the abyss.

2:22:21.880 --> 2:22:25.880
 That's much more fun than it sounds.

2:22:25.880 --> 2:22:27.520
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:28.520
 Why are we here?

2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:29.520
 It's life.

2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:30.520
 Yeah.

2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:31.920
 What's the meaning of life?

2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:34.200
 What's this existence we got?

2:22:34.200 --> 2:22:38.160
 You're trying to increase the amount of economic freedom on this planet or trying to alleviate

2:22:38.160 --> 2:22:39.160
 some of the suffering.

2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:40.160
 Yeah.

2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:41.800
 But why?

2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:46.040
 I don't really think there is any point to life.

2:22:46.040 --> 2:22:52.240
 You know, somebody once told me, you know, if you go into these like kind of really big

2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:58.040
 existential questions, it can get a little scary because like you stare off the cliff

2:22:58.040 --> 2:23:01.600
 and there's like, there's nothing there, you know?

2:23:01.600 --> 2:23:05.720
 This one person told me one time, they were like, you know, Brian, you should probably

2:23:05.720 --> 2:23:08.120
 snorkel, don't scoopa.

2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:13.000
 I guess, and I think they were trying to say like, some of my friends have done this,

2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:14.000
 right?

2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:19.200
 They'll go to like, you know, epic meditation retreats and like, they'll kind of come back

2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:22.280
 with all this existential dread of like, what's the meaning of it all?

2:23:22.280 --> 2:23:28.040
 And then like, as far as I can tell, we are just some organic molecules in the ocean started

2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:33.240
 like dividing and replicating and the selfish gene and all this stuff like basically ended

2:23:33.240 --> 2:23:34.640
 up here.

2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:39.120
 And our only, it's some kind of like really naive algorithm that's just kind of trying

2:23:39.120 --> 2:23:41.040
 to get us to survive and replicate.

2:23:41.040 --> 2:23:43.640
 And we have DNA just like every other animal.

2:23:43.640 --> 2:23:46.920
 And so we, and we happen to develop these like really cool neocortexes.

2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:51.080
 And so now we're sort of self aware and we have all these big questions.

2:23:51.080 --> 2:23:55.360
 And maybe, maybe we'll create another, you know, as computers get better, we'll create

2:23:55.360 --> 2:23:57.160
 the simulation inside our thing.

2:23:57.160 --> 2:23:58.840
 And I think it's cool.

2:23:58.840 --> 2:24:02.760
 Like we should basically, I just want to keep watching the movie, you know, unfold.

2:24:02.760 --> 2:24:06.600
 That's part of why I want to work on like new limit is really cool because it's helped.

2:24:06.600 --> 2:24:12.320
 If people can live longer, whether that's uploading their brain to the cloud or, you

2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:17.240
 know, basically through, we get biology to work or the strong AI to work or whatever,

2:24:17.240 --> 2:24:18.840
 one of those two hopefully works out.

2:24:18.840 --> 2:24:22.080
 And then we get to, we get to keep watching the movie and see how it all unfolds.

2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:23.440
 I think that's fun.

2:24:23.440 --> 2:24:27.080
 And so I don't know if that's like an answer, but I guess I don't think there's any real

2:24:27.080 --> 2:24:28.080
 purpose.

2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:29.080
 So just try to have fun.

2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:34.640
 Well, the cool thing is that we get to write the movie as we watch it.

2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:35.640
 Yeah.

2:24:35.640 --> 2:24:36.640
 That's exactly right.

2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:39.640
 I mean, that's like the Steve Jobs quote and all that where he's like, everything around

2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:43.120
 you was invented by some, somebody who just was like, that this was a crazy idea they

2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:44.120
 thought up.

2:24:44.120 --> 2:24:53.120
 So once you realize you can kind of do anything you want, then that's what you start to go,

2:24:53.120 --> 2:24:55.000
 you start to go try crazier stuff.

2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:58.880
 I mean, this is another one of those areas where not to get too out there, but like,

2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:03.120
 you know, when you're, I think you can build your comfort zone around like people being

2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:04.120
 upset with you.

2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:08.200
 You can also build your, your range of what you think is possible, right?

2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:12.560
 Like when I was a, when I was in my twenties, I was like reading all these books about like

2:25:12.560 --> 2:25:15.160
 self improvement and goal, how to write down your goals and stuff.

2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:21.600
 And my goals were like someday I want to make a hundred thousand dollars a year or something

2:25:21.600 --> 2:25:28.320
 like, and that was, and you know, and it seemed like a little outlandish or what, and I wrote

2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:31.200
 down these goals, like I want to own rental property or something.

2:25:31.200 --> 2:25:35.240
 Anyway, and I, and then I slowly started to get, get some of these things done over a

2:25:35.240 --> 2:25:36.240
 couple of years.

2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:38.400
 And I started to think a little bigger.

2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:42.240
 I remember one time I wrote down this goal where I was like, what's, what's the craziest

2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:43.240
 thing I could think of?

2:25:43.240 --> 2:25:47.560
 And I was like, what if I, I want to write, I want to start a billion dollar tech company.

2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:48.560
 That's crazy.

2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:51.880
 And I had, I had never started like a million dollar tech company or any, any tech company

2:25:51.880 --> 2:25:52.880
 really.

2:25:52.880 --> 2:25:54.920
 So what business did I have writing that goal down?

2:25:54.920 --> 2:26:00.280
 I remember I wrote that on a piece of paper, like, like probably every day for a year or

2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:01.280
 something, almost, right?

2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:05.800
 I don't know if it was every day, but like I wrote it down a lot and, and so little

2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:06.800
 things started to happen.

2:26:06.800 --> 2:26:10.200
 I was like, all right, well, maybe I should move back to the Bay Area from Buenos Aires.

2:26:10.200 --> 2:26:14.360
 Maybe I should try to apply to Y Combinator or whatever, like, and I started thinking

2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:15.360
 about these ideas.

2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:19.200
 And so whatever gets you fired up, it doesn't have to be like some company goal or startup

2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:20.200
 thing.

2:26:20.200 --> 2:26:21.200
 It could be anything, right?

2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:25.680
 Um, maybe you want to publish a book or like do something creatively or whatever.

2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:32.600
 Anyway, you, you know, I think like within seven years, uh, no, it's probably more like

2:26:32.600 --> 2:26:38.900
 10 years of me writing that goal down, um, Coinbase had evaluation over a billion dollars.

2:26:38.900 --> 2:26:43.000
 So it, it was out of my realm of what was even possible.

2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:46.600
 And then within 10 years, you can, you can accomplish more in 10 years than you think

2:26:46.600 --> 2:26:48.540
 less than in a year than you think.

2:26:48.540 --> 2:26:51.760
 So now I started, now I'm like, okay, what's the next goal?

2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:52.760
 What's the crate?

2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:53.760
 Okay.

2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:59.000
 Maybe I want to get a billion people accessing the open financial system through our products

2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:00.000
 every day.

2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:03.560
 So that would be cool for, for humanity and that's a pretty crazy goal.

2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:05.120
 Like there's only eight billion people or something, right?

2:27:05.120 --> 2:27:06.720
 So one out of eight.

2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:12.720
 Um, or maybe I can radically like, if I make some, like the right investments or whatever,

2:27:12.720 --> 2:27:18.000
 I can like help radically extend human health, uh, human health span or whatever, right?

2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:21.200
 Um, so try crazier stuff.

2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:26.960
 I don't know, even if it doesn't work, like hopefully you'll, um, you'll advance the state

2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:27.960
 of affairs.

2:27:27.960 --> 2:27:29.200
 Like something interesting will happen.

2:27:29.200 --> 2:27:33.160
 And so most people today, they look at, they look at people trying this stuff and they're

2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:35.320
 like, Oh my God, they're so, they're a genius.

2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:38.960
 So there's whatever, and it's like, or they're an idiot, like one of the two, neither one

2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:39.960
 or true.

2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:44.960
 It's just like, um, anybody can start by thinking about what they want and then like go for

2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:45.960
 it.

2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:48.200
 And then, and once you get that, like go for something a little bigger and like, you just

2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:49.200
 have fun with it.

2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:53.640
 And the universe is a way of smiling and, uh, helping you out.

2:27:53.640 --> 2:27:58.680
 If you just write it down and, and you dream big, there's, there's something about just

2:27:58.680 --> 2:28:03.400
 karma, about the energy you put into this world.

2:28:03.400 --> 2:28:04.680
 Other people will help you out.

2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:05.680
 Doors will open.

2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:10.000
 You'll notice that the door's opened and you'll, you could actually have a shot at making

2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:11.000
 it happen.

2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:12.000
 It's a funny world.

2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:13.000
 Yeah.

2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:15.760
 I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't really subscribe to all like the woo woo interpretations

2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:20.040
 of this, but my, my very rational brain interpretation of it is that if you just wake up every day

2:28:20.040 --> 2:28:24.240
 and write down like what you want to get done and towards your longer goals at your larger

2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:26.640
 goals, it's just, it's just on your mind that day.

2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:29.000
 So you start to notice opportunities and you think about it more.

2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:31.360
 So Brian, thank you for dreaming big.

2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:37.240
 Um, thank you for doing what you're doing, doing incredible engineering at scale, uh,

2:28:37.240 --> 2:28:41.760
 trying to help all people from all over the world and, um, actually helping me personally

2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:46.440
 get more into crypto just cause it's so easy.

2:28:46.440 --> 2:28:48.280
 So, um, thank you so much.

2:28:48.280 --> 2:28:53.480
 And thank you so much for giving your extremely valuable time today to this awesome conversation.

2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:54.960

2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:10.280
 And now let me leave you with some words from Benjamin Franklin, an investment in knowledge

2:29:10.280 --> 2:29:13.080
 pays the best interest.

2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:26.240
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
