00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
 Mossad will do anything.

00:01.600 --> 00:05.440
 Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes

00:05.440 --> 00:08.720
 to ensure the survival of every Israeli citizen

00:08.720 --> 00:09.780
 around the world.

00:09.780 --> 00:12.920
 Most other countries will stop at some point,

00:12.920 --> 00:14.280
 but Mossad doesn't do that.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.960
 The following is a conversation with Andrew Bustamante,

00:19.960 --> 00:22.520
 former CIA covert intelligence officer

00:22.520 --> 00:24.800
 and US Air Force combat veteran,

00:24.800 --> 00:27.760
 including the job of operational targeting

00:27.760 --> 00:31.240
 encrypted communications and launch operations

00:31.240 --> 00:36.240
 for 200 nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.920
 Andrew's over seven years as a CIA spy

00:39.920 --> 00:43.760
 have given him a skill set and a perspective on the world

00:43.760 --> 00:45.660
 that is fascinating to explore.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.640
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:50.840 --> 00:52.120
 in the description.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.740
 And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Bustamante.

00:55.740 --> 00:59.340
 The Central Intelligence Agency was formed

00:59.340 --> 01:01.540
 almost 75 years ago.

01:01.540 --> 01:02.980
 What is the mission of the CIA?

01:02.980 --> 01:04.100
 How does it work?

01:04.100 --> 01:07.380
 The mission of the CIA is to collect intelligence

01:07.380 --> 01:08.740
 from around the world that supports

01:08.740 --> 01:10.500
 a national security mission

01:10.500 --> 01:12.380
 and be the central repository

01:12.380 --> 01:14.620
 for all other intelligence agencies

01:14.620 --> 01:17.340
 so that it's one collective source

01:17.340 --> 01:20.220
 where all intelligence can be synthesized

01:20.220 --> 01:23.060
 and then passed forward to the decision makers.

01:23.060 --> 01:26.140
 That doesn't include domestic intelligence.

01:26.140 --> 01:29.460
 It's primarily looking outward outside the United States.

01:29.460 --> 01:30.300
 Correct.

01:30.300 --> 01:34.420
 CIA is the foreign intelligence collection.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.460
 King spoke, if you will.

01:37.460 --> 01:38.940
 FBI does domestic

01:38.940 --> 01:41.620
 and then Department of Homeland Security does domestic.

01:41.620 --> 01:45.300
 Law enforcement essentially handles all things domestic.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.740
 Intelligence is not law enforcement.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.980
 So we technically cannot work inside the United States.

01:49.980 --> 01:52.460
 Is there clear lines to be drawn between,

01:52.460 --> 01:54.580
 like you just said, the FBI,

01:54.580 --> 01:58.260
 CIA, FBI, and the other US intelligence agencies

01:58.260 --> 02:01.860
 like the DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency,

02:01.860 --> 02:03.540
 Department of Homeland Security,

02:04.420 --> 02:08.100
 NSA, National Security Agency, and there's a list.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.020
 There's a list of about 33 different

02:10.020 --> 02:11.100
 intelligence organizations.

02:11.100 --> 02:11.940
 Yeah, here it is.

02:11.940 --> 02:14.780
 The Army, the Navy has all the different organizations

02:14.780 --> 02:16.740
 have their own intelligence groups.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.740
 So is there clear lines here to be drawn

02:19.740 --> 02:23.220
 or is the CIA the giant integrator of all of these?

02:23.220 --> 02:24.540
 It's a little bit of both, to be honest.

02:24.540 --> 02:26.300
 So yes, there are absolutely lines

02:26.300 --> 02:28.340
 and more so than the lines.

02:28.340 --> 02:30.980
 There are lines that divide what our primary mission is.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.740
 Everything's got to be prioritized.

02:32.740 --> 02:33.660
 That's one of the benefits

02:33.660 --> 02:36.100
 and the superpowers of the United States

02:36.100 --> 02:38.620
 is we prioritize everything.

02:38.620 --> 02:41.060
 So different intelligence organizations are prioritized

02:41.060 --> 02:43.540
 to collect certain types of intelligence.

02:43.540 --> 02:47.100
 And then within the confines of how they collect,

02:47.100 --> 02:49.340
 they're also given unique authorities,

02:49.340 --> 02:51.540
 authorities are a term that's directed

02:51.540 --> 02:53.500
 by the executive branch.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.540
 Different agencies have different authorities

02:55.540 --> 02:58.620
 to execute missions in different ways.

02:58.620 --> 03:01.260
 FBI can't execute the same way CIA executes

03:01.260 --> 03:05.500
 and CIA can't execute the same way NGA executes.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.940
 But then at the end, excuse me, when it's all collected,

03:08.940 --> 03:13.940
 then yes, CIA still acts as a final synthesizing repository

03:15.100 --> 03:17.740
 to create what's known as the president's daily brief,

03:17.740 --> 03:20.780
 the PDB, the only way CIA can create the PDB

03:20.780 --> 03:24.860
 is by being the single source of all source intelligence

03:24.860 --> 03:28.380
 from around the IC, the intelligence community,

03:28.380 --> 03:33.380
 which are those 30 some odd and always changing organizations

03:33.500 --> 03:35.980
 that are sponsored for intelligence operations.

03:35.980 --> 03:38.900
 What does the PDB, the president's daily brief look like?

03:38.900 --> 03:39.740
 How long is it?

03:39.740 --> 03:41.580
 What does it contain?

03:41.580 --> 03:42.620
 So first of all, it looks like

03:42.620 --> 03:45.300
 the most expensive book report you can ever imagine.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.820
 It's got its own binder.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.980
 It's all very high end.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.260
 It feels important.

03:50.260 --> 03:51.100
 It looks important.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.220
 It's not like a cheap trapper keeper.

03:54.220 --> 03:56.020
 It's somewhere between,

03:56.020 --> 03:59.340
 I would give it probably between 50 and 125 pages a day.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.500
 It's produced every day around two o clock in the morning

04:02.500 --> 04:04.500
 by a dedicated group of analysts.

04:04.500 --> 04:09.500
 And each page is essentially a short paragraph

04:09.900 --> 04:13.420
 to a few paragraphs about a priority happening

04:13.420 --> 04:16.500
 that affects national security from around the world.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.660
 The president rarely gets to the entire briefing in a day.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.780
 He relies on a briefer instead to prioritize

04:22.780 --> 04:25.060
 what inside the briefing needs to be shared

04:25.060 --> 04:25.900
 with the president.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.620
 Cause some days the PDB will get briefed in 10 minutes

04:28.620 --> 04:30.580
 and some days it'll be briefed over the course of two hours.

04:30.580 --> 04:32.820
 It depends on the president's schedule.

04:32.820 --> 04:36.220
 How much competition is there for the first page?

04:36.220 --> 04:39.660
 And so how much jockeying there is for attention.

04:41.060 --> 04:44.500
 I imagine for all the different intelligence agencies

04:44.500 --> 04:46.980
 and within the CIA, there's probably different groups

04:46.980 --> 04:49.980
 that are modular and they're all care about different

04:49.980 --> 04:53.340
 nations or different cases.

04:53.340 --> 04:55.700
 And is there, do you understand

04:57.180 --> 04:59.460
 how much competition there is for the attention,

04:59.460 --> 05:01.460
 for the limited attention of the president?

05:01.460 --> 05:05.300
 You're 100% correct in how the agency

05:05.300 --> 05:09.620
 and how officers and managers at the agency handle the PDB.

05:09.620 --> 05:10.940
 There's a ton of competition.

05:10.940 --> 05:12.660
 Everybody wants to be the first on the radar.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.380
 Everybody wants to be on the first page.

05:14.380 --> 05:17.260
 The thing that we're not baking into the equation

05:17.260 --> 05:19.140
 is the president's interests.

05:19.140 --> 05:21.460
 The president dictates what's on the first page of his PDB

05:21.460 --> 05:23.780
 and he will tell them usually the day before,

05:23.780 --> 05:25.420
 I want to see this on the first page tomorrow.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.380
 Bring this to me in the beginning.

05:26.380 --> 05:28.700
 I don't want to hear about what's happening in Mozambique.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.860
 I don't really care about what's happening in Saudi Arabia.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.820
 I want to see one, two, three.

05:32.820 --> 05:34.700
 And regardless of whether or not those are the three

05:34.700 --> 05:37.020
 biggest things in the world,

05:37.020 --> 05:39.300
 the president's the executive, he's the one,

05:39.300 --> 05:40.660
 he's the ultimate customer.

05:40.660 --> 05:42.580
 So we do what the customer says.

05:42.580 --> 05:44.620
 That has backfired in the past.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.500
 If you haven't already started seeing

05:46.500 --> 05:49.260
 how that could go wrong, that has backfired in the past,

05:49.260 --> 05:51.220
 but that is essentially what happens

05:51.220 --> 05:53.340
 when you serve in the executive branch.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.100
 You serve the executive.

05:55.100 --> 05:58.060
 So what's the role of the director of the CIA

05:58.060 --> 05:59.820
 versus the president?

05:59.820 --> 06:01.300
 What's that dance like?

06:01.300 --> 06:06.060
 So the president really leads the focus of the CIA?

06:06.060 --> 06:09.340
 The president is the commander in chief for the military,

06:09.340 --> 06:11.820
 but the executive, the president is also

06:11.820 --> 06:16.220
 the executive for the entirety of the intelligence community.

06:16.220 --> 06:19.540
 So he's the ultimate customer.

06:19.540 --> 06:22.820
 If you look at it like a business, the customer,

06:22.820 --> 06:25.580
 the person spending the money is the president

06:25.580 --> 06:27.500
 and the director is the CEO.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.580
 So if the director doesn't create what the president wants,

06:30.580 --> 06:31.620
 there's gonna be a new director.

06:31.620 --> 06:32.900
 That's why the director of CIA

06:32.900 --> 06:34.540
 is a presidential appointed position.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.220
 Sometimes they're extremely qualified

06:36.220 --> 06:37.620
 intelligence professionals.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.580
 Sometimes they're just professional politicians

06:39.580 --> 06:41.500
 or soldiers that could put into that seat

06:41.500 --> 06:43.780
 because the president trusts them

06:43.780 --> 06:46.740
 to do what he wants them to do.

06:46.740 --> 06:51.740
 Another gaping area that causes problems,

06:52.380 --> 06:54.220
 but that's still the way it is.

06:54.220 --> 06:57.260
 So you think this is a problematic configuration

06:57.260 --> 06:58.100
 of the whole system?

06:58.100 --> 06:59.460
 Massive flaw in the system.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.860
 It is a massive flaw in the system

07:00.860 --> 07:03.860
 because if you're essentially appointing a director

07:03.860 --> 07:05.500
 to do what you want them to do,

07:05.500 --> 07:08.580
 then you're assigning a crony.

07:08.580 --> 07:10.820
 And that's what we define corruption as

07:10.820 --> 07:11.660
 within the United States.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.660
 And inside the United States,

07:12.660 --> 07:15.020
 we say if you pick somebody outside of merit

07:15.020 --> 07:16.660
 for any other reason other than merit,

07:16.660 --> 07:19.540
 then it's cronyism or it's nepotism.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.700
 Here, that's exactly what our structure is built on.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.940
 All presidential appointees are appointed

07:23.940 --> 07:25.060
 on something other than merit.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.460
 So for an intelligence agency to be effective,

07:27.460 --> 07:31.740
 it has to discover the truth and communicate that truth.

07:31.740 --> 07:34.700
 And maybe if you're appointing the director of that agency,

07:34.700 --> 07:37.420
 you're not, they're less likely to communicate

07:37.420 --> 07:39.980
 the truth to you unless the truth aligns perfectly

07:39.980 --> 07:41.740
 with your desired worldview.

07:41.740 --> 07:43.060
 Well, not necessarily perfectly

07:43.060 --> 07:44.820
 because there are other steps, right?

07:44.820 --> 07:46.900
 They have to be, they have to go in front of Congress

07:46.900 --> 07:48.420
 and they have to have the support

07:48.420 --> 07:51.940
 of multiple legislatures or legislators,

07:51.940 --> 07:55.820
 but the challenges that the short list of people

07:55.820 --> 07:59.260
 who even get the opportunity aren't a meritorious list.

07:59.260 --> 08:01.540
 It's a short list based off of who the president is picking

08:01.540 --> 08:03.340
 or who the would be president is picking.

08:03.340 --> 08:06.860
 Now, I think we've proven that an intelligence organization

08:06.860 --> 08:08.780
 can be, an intelligence organization

08:08.780 --> 08:13.300
 can be extremely effective even within the flawed system.

08:13.300 --> 08:16.300
 The challenge is how much more effective could we be

08:16.300 --> 08:17.740
 if we improved?

08:17.740 --> 08:20.180
 And that's, I think that's the challenge

08:20.180 --> 08:21.940
 that faces a lot of the US government.

08:21.940 --> 08:24.860
 I think that's a challenge that has resulted

08:24.860 --> 08:28.540
 in what we see today when it comes to the decline

08:28.540 --> 08:31.140
 of American power and American influence,

08:31.140 --> 08:35.420
 the rise of foreign influence, authoritarian powers

08:35.420 --> 08:39.500
 and a shrinking US economy, a growing Chinese economy.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.860
 And it's just, we have questions,

08:41.860 --> 08:43.380
 hard questions we need to ask ourselves

08:43.380 --> 08:45.220
 about how we're gonna handle the future.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.860
 What aspect of that communication between the president

08:47.860 --> 08:52.860
 and the CIA could be fixed to help fix the problems

08:53.460 --> 08:54.580
 that you're referring to

08:54.580 --> 08:57.620
 in terms of the decline of American power?

08:57.620 --> 09:01.260
 So when you talk about the president wanting

09:01.260 --> 09:04.620
 to prioritize what the president cares about,

09:04.620 --> 09:07.540
 that immediately shows a break

09:07.540 --> 09:09.700
 between what actually matters

09:09.700 --> 09:12.300
 to the longterm success of the United States

09:12.300 --> 09:15.540
 versus what benefits the short term success

09:15.540 --> 09:16.500
 of the current president.

09:16.500 --> 09:20.180
 Because any president is just a human being

09:20.180 --> 09:21.900
 and has a very narrow focus

09:21.900 --> 09:24.700
 and narrow focus is not a longterm calculation.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.660
 Exactly, what's the maximum amount of years

09:26.660 --> 09:28.260
 a president can be president?

09:28.260 --> 09:29.220
 Eight.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.580
 He has to be ocean.

09:30.580 --> 09:31.580
 In the United States.

09:31.580 --> 09:34.180
 In the United States, according to our current constitution.

09:34.180 --> 09:35.000
 Yeah.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.300
 But they're very limited

09:39.300 --> 09:41.540
 in terms of what they have to prioritize.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.020
 And then if you look at a four year cycle,

09:44.020 --> 09:45.700
 two years of that is essentially preparing

09:45.700 --> 09:47.100
 for the next election cycle.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.140
 So what's only two years of really quality attention

09:49.140 --> 09:49.980
 you get from the president?

09:49.980 --> 09:51.460
 Who is the chief executive

09:51.460 --> 09:53.060
 of all the intelligence community?

09:53.060 --> 09:55.220
 So the most important thing to them

09:55.220 --> 09:57.020
 is not always the most important thing

09:57.020 --> 09:59.660
 to the longterm survival of the United States.

09:59.660 --> 10:02.020
 What do you make of the hostile relationship

10:02.020 --> 10:04.700
 that immediately stands out of the presidents

10:04.700 --> 10:07.340
 between Donald Trump and the CIA?

10:07.340 --> 10:11.500
 Was that a very kind of personal bickering?

10:11.500 --> 10:13.300
 I mean, is there something interesting to you

10:13.300 --> 10:16.340
 about the dynamics between that particular president

10:16.340 --> 10:17.980
 and that particular instantiation

10:17.980 --> 10:19.380
 of the intelligence agency?

10:19.380 --> 10:21.740
 Man, there were lots of things fascinating to me

10:21.740 --> 10:23.700
 about that relationship.

10:23.700 --> 10:24.540
 So first.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.100
 What's the good and the bad, Sergeant Trump?

10:26.100 --> 10:27.980
 So let me start with the good first.

10:27.980 --> 10:28.820
 Cause there's a lot of people

10:28.820 --> 10:30.900
 who don't think there was any good.

10:30.900 --> 10:35.700
 So the good thing is we saw that the president

10:35.700 --> 10:40.340
 who's the chief customer, the executive to the CIA,

10:40.340 --> 10:42.500
 when the president doesn't want to hear

10:42.500 --> 10:45.500
 what CIA has to say, he's not gonna listen.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.540
 I think that's an important lesson

10:46.540 --> 10:49.100
 for everyone to take home.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.580
 If the president doesn't care what you have to say,

10:51.580 --> 10:52.780
 he's gonna take funding away

10:52.780 --> 10:54.620
 or she will take funding away.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.220
 They're gonna take attention away.

10:56.220 --> 11:01.220
 They're going to shut down your operations, your missions.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.740
 They're gonna kill the careers of the people working there.

11:04.740 --> 11:05.580
 Think about that.

11:05.580 --> 11:08.460
 For the four years that President Trump was the president,

11:08.460 --> 11:11.940
 basically everybody at CIA, their career was put on pause.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.620
 Some people's careers were ended.

11:13.620 --> 11:16.260
 Some people voluntarily left their career there

11:16.260 --> 11:18.820
 because they found themselves working

11:18.820 --> 11:20.860
 for a single customer that didn't want

11:20.860 --> 11:21.860
 what they had to produce.

11:21.860 --> 11:24.460
 So for people who don't know,

11:24.460 --> 11:27.780
 Donald Trump did not display significant deep interest

11:27.780 --> 11:28.820
 in the output.

11:29.780 --> 11:30.820
 He did not trust it, yeah.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.420
 He was a disinterested customer.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.260
 Exactly right.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.380
 The information.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.940
 And then what do disinterested customers do?

11:36.940 --> 11:39.660
 They go find someone else to create their product.

11:39.660 --> 11:41.140
 And that's exactly what Donald Trump did.

11:41.140 --> 11:43.260
 And he did it through the private intelligence world,

11:43.260 --> 11:45.460
 funding private intelligence companies

11:45.460 --> 11:46.900
 to run their own operations

11:46.900 --> 11:49.540
 that brought him the information he cared about

11:49.540 --> 11:50.900
 when CIA wouldn't.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.940
 It also didn't help that CIA stepped

11:52.940 --> 11:54.540
 outside of their confines, right?

11:54.540 --> 11:56.620
 CIA is supposed to collect foreign intelligence

11:56.620 --> 11:58.700
 and not comment on domestic matters.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.380
 They went way outside of that

12:00.380 --> 12:02.340
 when they started challenging the president,

12:02.340 --> 12:04.140
 when they started questioning the results,

12:04.140 --> 12:08.300
 when they started publicly claiming Russian influence.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.740
 That's all something the FBI could have handled by itself.

12:10.740 --> 12:12.540
 The Justice Department could have handled by itself.

12:12.540 --> 12:16.300
 CIA had no place to contribute to that conversation.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.780
 And when they did, all they did was undermine

12:18.780 --> 12:21.700
 the relationship they had with their primary customer.

12:21.700 --> 12:26.220
 Let me sort of focus in on this relationship

12:26.220 --> 12:29.140
 between the president or the leader

12:29.140 --> 12:31.100
 and the intelligence agency

12:31.100 --> 12:33.100
 and look outside the United States.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.540
 It seems like authoritarian regimes

12:36.540 --> 12:37.860
 or regimes throughout history,

12:37.860 --> 12:39.780
 if you look at Stalin and Hitler,

12:39.780 --> 12:42.700
 if you look at today with Vladimir Putin,

12:42.700 --> 12:44.420
 the negative effects of power

12:44.420 --> 12:48.580
 corrupting the mind of a leader manifest itself

12:48.580 --> 12:51.700
 is that they start to get bad information

12:51.700 --> 12:53.420
 from the intelligence agencies.

12:53.420 --> 12:55.660
 So this kind of thing that you're talking about,

12:55.660 --> 12:58.660
 over time, they start hearing information

12:58.660 --> 13:00.740
 that they want to hear.

13:00.740 --> 13:02.220
 The agency starts producing

13:02.220 --> 13:05.620
 only the kind of information they want to hear

13:05.620 --> 13:09.900
 and the leader's worldview starts becoming distorted

13:09.900 --> 13:13.860
 to where the propaganda they generate

13:13.860 --> 13:17.260
 is also the thing that the intelligence agencies

13:17.260 --> 13:18.540
 provide to them.

13:18.540 --> 13:19.740
 And so they start getting this,

13:19.740 --> 13:21.540
 they start believing in their own propaganda

13:21.540 --> 13:23.740
 and they start getting distorted view of the world.

13:23.740 --> 13:27.420
 Sorry for the sort of walking through in a weird way,

13:27.420 --> 13:28.820
 but I guess I want to ask,

13:28.820 --> 13:32.580
 do you think, let's look at Vladimir Putin specifically,

13:32.580 --> 13:37.580
 do you think he's getting accurate information

13:37.740 --> 13:38.580
 about the world?

13:38.580 --> 13:40.780
 Do you think he knows the truth of the world,

13:40.780 --> 13:42.620
 whether that's the war on Ukraine,

13:42.620 --> 13:45.100
 whether that's the behavior of the other nations

13:45.100 --> 13:47.420
 in NATO, the United States in general?

13:47.420 --> 13:49.020
 What do you think?

13:49.020 --> 13:52.580
 It's rare that I'll talk about just thinking.

13:52.580 --> 13:55.420
 I prefer to share my assessment,

13:55.420 --> 13:56.940
 why I assess things a certain way,

13:56.940 --> 13:59.540
 rather than just what's my random opinion.

13:59.540 --> 14:02.900
 In my assessment, Vladimir Putin is winning.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.100
 Russia is winning.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.740
 They're winning in Ukraine,

14:05.740 --> 14:07.900
 but they're also winning the battle of influence

14:07.900 --> 14:08.820
 against the West.

14:08.820 --> 14:11.140
 They're winning in the face of economic sanctions.

14:11.140 --> 14:12.300
 They're winning.

14:12.300 --> 14:15.460
 Empirically, when you look at the math, they're winning.

14:15.460 --> 14:18.460
 So when you ask me whether or not Putin is getting

14:18.460 --> 14:20.500
 good information from his intelligence services,

14:20.500 --> 14:22.860
 when I look at my overall assessment

14:22.860 --> 14:24.420
 of multiple data points,

14:24.420 --> 14:26.900
 he must be getting good information.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.540
 Do I know how or why?

14:28.540 --> 14:29.660
 I do not.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.180
 I don't know how or why it works there.

14:31.180 --> 14:34.980
 I don't know how such deep cronyism,

14:34.980 --> 14:39.980
 such deep corruption can possibly yield true real results.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.420
 And yet somehow there are real results happening.

14:42.420 --> 14:45.980
 So it's either excessive waste and an accidental win,

14:45.980 --> 14:48.180
 or there really is a system and a process there

14:48.180 --> 14:49.260
 that's functioning.

14:49.260 --> 14:51.660
 So this winning idea is very interesting.

14:51.660 --> 14:55.260
 In what way, short term and long term, is Russia winning?

14:55.260 --> 14:57.060
 Some people say there was a miscalculation

14:57.060 --> 14:59.260
 of the way the invasion happened.

14:59.260 --> 15:02.260
 There was an assumption that you would be able

15:02.260 --> 15:04.620
 to successfully take you,

15:04.620 --> 15:08.620
 you'd be able to successfully capture the East, the South

15:08.620 --> 15:10.620
 and the North of Ukraine.

15:10.620 --> 15:15.620
 And with what now appears to be significantly insufficient

15:15.620 --> 15:19.620
 troops spread way too thin across way too large of a front.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.620
 So that seems to be like an intelligence failure.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.620
 And that doesn't seem to be like winning.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.620
 In another way, it doesn't seem like winning

15:30.620 --> 15:33.620
 if we put aside the human cost of war.

15:33.620 --> 15:37.620
 It doesn't seem like winning because the hearts and minds

15:37.620 --> 15:42.620
 of the West were completely on the side of Ukraine.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.620
 This particular leader and Volodymyr Zelensky

15:45.620 --> 15:47.620
 captured the attention of the world

15:47.620 --> 15:51.620
 and the hearts and minds of Europe, the West

15:51.620 --> 15:53.620
 and many other nations throughout the world,

15:53.620 --> 15:56.620
 both financially in terms of military equipment

15:56.620 --> 16:00.620
 and in terms of sort of social and cultural

16:00.620 --> 16:03.620
 and emotional support for the independence fight

16:03.620 --> 16:05.620
 of this nation.

16:05.620 --> 16:08.620
 That seems to be like a miscalculation.

16:08.620 --> 16:11.620
 So against that pushback,

16:11.620 --> 16:17.620
 why do you think there's still kernels of winning

16:17.620 --> 16:19.620
 in this on the Russian side?

16:19.620 --> 16:21.620
 What you're laying out isn't incorrect

16:21.620 --> 16:25.620
 and the miscalculations are not unexpected.

16:25.620 --> 16:28.620
 Anybody who's been to a military college

16:28.620 --> 16:30.620
 and including the Army War College in Pennsylvania

16:30.620 --> 16:34.620
 where so many of our military leaders are brought up,

16:34.620 --> 16:37.620
 when you look at the conflict in Ukraine,

16:37.620 --> 16:41.620
 it fits the exact mold of what an effective,

16:41.620 --> 16:44.620
 long term military conflict,

16:44.620 --> 16:47.620
 protracted military conflict would and should look like

16:47.620 --> 16:49.620
 for military dominance.

16:49.620 --> 16:52.620
 Now, did Zelensky and the Ukrainians

16:52.620 --> 16:54.620
 shock the world? Absolutely.

16:54.620 --> 16:57.620
 But in that, they also shocked American intelligence,

16:57.620 --> 16:59.620
 which, like you said, miscalculated.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.620
 The whole world miscalculated how the Ukrainians would respond.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.620
 Putin did not move in there accidentally.

17:04.620 --> 17:06.620
 He had an assessment.

17:06.620 --> 17:08.620
 He had high likelihood of a certain outcome

17:08.620 --> 17:10.620
 and that outcome did not happen.

17:10.620 --> 17:12.620
 Why did he have that calculation?

17:12.620 --> 17:15.620
 Because in 2014, it worked.

17:15.620 --> 17:19.620
 He invaded, he took Crimea in 14 days.

17:19.620 --> 17:24.620
 He basically created an infiltration campaign

17:24.620 --> 17:26.620
 that turned key leaders over

17:26.620 --> 17:28.620
 in the first few days of the conflict.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.620
 So essentially, there was no conflict.

17:30.620 --> 17:32.620
 It worked in 2008 when he took Georgia.

17:32.620 --> 17:34.620
 Nobody talks about that.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.620
 He invaded Georgia the exact same way and it worked.

17:37.620 --> 17:39.620
 So in 2008, it worked.

17:39.620 --> 17:40.620
 In 2014, it worked.

17:40.620 --> 17:42.620
 There was no reason to believe it wasn't going to work again.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.620
 So he just carried out the same campaign.

17:44.620 --> 17:47.620
 But this time, something was different.

17:47.620 --> 17:50.620
 That was a miscalculation for sure on the part of Putin

17:50.620 --> 17:52.620
 and the reason that there was no support from the West,

17:52.620 --> 17:54.620
 because let's not forget, there is no support.

17:54.620 --> 17:58.620
 There is nothing other than the Lend Lease Act,

17:58.620 --> 18:02.620
 which is putting Ukraine in massive debt right now to the West.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.620
 That's the only form of support they're getting from NATO

18:05.620 --> 18:07.620
 or the United States.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.620
 So if somebody believed Ukraine would win,

18:10.620 --> 18:12.620
 if somebody believed Ukraine had a chance,

18:12.620 --> 18:15.620
 they would have gotten more material support than just debt.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.620
 And we can jump into that anytime you want to.

18:17.620 --> 18:19.620
 But the whole world miscalculated.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.620
 Everybody thought Russia was going to win in 14 days.

18:21.620 --> 18:23.620
 I said that they would win in 14 days,

18:23.620 --> 18:25.620
 because that was the predominant calculation.

18:25.620 --> 18:28.620
 Once the first invasion didn't work,

18:28.620 --> 18:32.620
 then the military does what professional militaries do, man.

18:32.620 --> 18:37.620
 They reevaluate, they reorganize leaders,

18:37.620 --> 18:39.620
 and then they take a new approach.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.620
 You saw three approaches.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.620
 The first two did not work.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.620
 The first two campaigns against Ukraine did not work

18:45.620 --> 18:47.620
 the way they were supposed to work.

18:47.620 --> 18:50.620
 The third has worked exactly like it's supposed to work.

18:50.620 --> 18:53.620
 You don't need Kiev to win Ukraine.

18:53.620 --> 18:56.620
 You don't need hearts and minds to win Ukraine.

18:56.620 --> 18:57.620
 What's the third?

18:57.620 --> 19:00.620
 Yeah, what you need is control of natural resources,

19:00.620 --> 19:02.620
 which they're taking in the east,

19:02.620 --> 19:05.620
 and you need access to the heartbeat,

19:05.620 --> 19:08.620
 the blood flow of food and money into the country,

19:08.620 --> 19:10.620
 which they're taking in the south.

19:10.620 --> 19:14.620
 The fact that Ukraine had to go to the negotiation table

19:14.620 --> 19:18.620
 with Russia and Turkey in order to get exports

19:18.620 --> 19:21.620
 out of the Black Sea approved again,

19:21.620 --> 19:24.620
 demonstrates just how much Ukraine is losing.

19:24.620 --> 19:28.620
 The aggressor had a seat at the negotiation table

19:28.620 --> 19:31.620
 to allow Ukraine the ability to even export

19:31.620 --> 19:33.620
 one of its top exports.

19:33.620 --> 19:36.620
 If Russia would have said no, then they would not have had that.

19:36.620 --> 19:39.620
 Russia has that's like someone holding your throat.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.620
 It's like somebody holding your jugular vein

19:41.620 --> 19:45.620
 and saying, if you don't do what I tell you to do,

19:45.620 --> 19:47.620
 then I'm not going to let you breathe.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.620
 I'm not going to let blood flow to your brain.

19:49.620 --> 19:55.620
 So do you think it's possible that Russia takes the south of Ukraine?

19:55.620 --> 19:57.620
 It takes...

19:57.620 --> 20:02.620
 So starting from Mariupol, the Hursan region.

20:02.620 --> 20:04.620
 All the way to Odessa.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.620
 All the way to Odessa.

20:05.620 --> 20:08.620
 And into Moldova.

20:08.620 --> 20:11.620
 I believe all of that will happen before the fall.

20:11.620 --> 20:13.620
 Fall of this year?

20:13.620 --> 20:14.620
 Fall of this year.

20:14.620 --> 20:16.620
 Before winter hits Europe,

20:16.620 --> 20:21.620
 NATO wants Germany needs to be able to have sanctions lifted

20:21.620 --> 20:23.620
 so they can tap into Russian power.

20:23.620 --> 20:26.620
 There's no way they can have those sanctions lifted

20:26.620 --> 20:28.620
 unless Russia wins.

20:28.620 --> 20:31.620
 And Russia also knows that all of Europe,

20:31.620 --> 20:36.620
 all of NATO is the true people feeling the pain of the war

20:36.620 --> 20:39.620
 outside of Ukraine are the NATO countries

20:39.620 --> 20:42.620
 because they're so heavily reliant on Russia.

20:42.620 --> 20:45.620
 And as they have supported American sanctions against Russia,

20:45.620 --> 20:47.620
 their people feel the pain.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.620
 Economically, their people feel the pain.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.620
 What are they going to do in the winter?

20:51.620 --> 20:53.620
 Because without Russian gas,

20:53.620 --> 20:56.620
 their people are going to freeze to death.

20:56.620 --> 20:57.620
 Ukrainian people?

20:57.620 --> 20:59.620
 People all over NATO.

20:59.620 --> 21:02.620
 Ukraine, everybody knows Ukraine's at risk.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.620
 Everybody knows Ukrainians are dying.

21:04.620 --> 21:07.620
 The game of war isn't played.

21:07.620 --> 21:11.620
 It isn't played majoritively by the people who are fighting.

21:11.620 --> 21:13.620
 The game of war is played by everyone else.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.620
 It's an economic game. It's not a military game.

21:15.620 --> 21:18.620
 The flow of resources and energy and food.

21:18.620 --> 21:20.620
 Attention, exactly right.

21:20.620 --> 21:24.620
 I was on the front in the Herzog region,

21:24.620 --> 21:26.620
 the very area that you're referring to,

21:26.620 --> 21:28.620
 and I spoke to a lot of people,

21:28.620 --> 21:32.620
 and the morale is incredibly high.

21:32.620 --> 21:37.620
 And I don't think the people in that region,

21:37.620 --> 21:43.620
 soldiers, volunteer soldiers, civilians,

21:43.620 --> 21:47.620
 are going to give up that land without dying.

21:47.620 --> 21:48.620
 I agree with you.

21:48.620 --> 21:51.620
 I mean, in order to take Odessa,

21:51.620 --> 21:57.620
 it would require a huge amount of artillery

21:57.620 --> 22:00.620
 and slaughter of civilians, essentially.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.620
 They're not going to use artillery in Odessa

22:02.620 --> 22:06.620
 because Odessa is too important to Russian culture.

22:06.620 --> 22:08.620
 It's going to be even uglier than that.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.620
 It's going to be clearing up streets, clearing up buildings,

22:11.620 --> 22:13.620
 person by person, troop by troop.

22:13.620 --> 22:15.620
 It'll be a lot like what it was in Markov.

22:15.620 --> 22:17.620
 Just shooting at civilians.

22:17.620 --> 22:20.620
 Because they can't afford to just do bombing raids

22:20.620 --> 22:22.620
 because they're going to destroy cultural,

22:22.620 --> 22:25.620
 significant architecture that's just too important

22:25.620 --> 22:26.620
 to the Russian culture,

22:26.620 --> 22:28.620
 and that's going to demoralize their own Russian people.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.620
 I have to do a lot of thinking

22:30.620 --> 22:32.620
 to try to understand what I even feel.

22:32.620 --> 22:37.620
 I don't know, but in terms of information,

22:37.620 --> 22:40.620
 the thing that the Russian soldiers are saying,

22:40.620 --> 22:43.620
 the thing the Russian soldiers really believe

22:43.620 --> 22:45.620
 is that they're freeing,

22:45.620 --> 22:53.620
 they're liberating the Ukrainian people from Nazis.

22:53.620 --> 22:57.620
 And they believe this because I visited Ukraine

22:57.620 --> 23:00.620
 and I spoke to over 100,

23:00.620 --> 23:02.620
 probably a couple hundred Ukrainian people

23:02.620 --> 23:04.620
 from different walks of life.

23:04.620 --> 23:07.620
 It feels like the Russian soldiers,

23:07.620 --> 23:10.620
 at least under a cloud of propaganda,

23:10.620 --> 23:15.620
 they're not operating on a clear view of the whole world.

23:15.620 --> 23:20.620
 And given all that,

23:20.620 --> 23:27.620
 I just don't see Russia taking the south

23:27.620 --> 23:32.620
 without committing war crimes.

23:32.620 --> 23:36.620
 And if Vladimir Putin is aware of what's happening

23:36.620 --> 23:38.620
 in terms of the treatment of civilians,

23:38.620 --> 23:44.620
 I don't see him pushing forward all the way to take the south

23:44.620 --> 23:49.620
 because that's not going to be an effective strategy

23:49.620 --> 23:53.620
 for him to win the hearts and minds of his people.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.620
 Autocracies don't need to win hearts and minds.

23:56.620 --> 23:59.620
 That's a staunchly democratic point of view.

23:59.620 --> 24:02.620
 Hearts and minds mean very little to people

24:02.620 --> 24:11.620
 who understand core basic needs and true power.

24:11.620 --> 24:14.620
 You don't see Xi Jinping worrying about hearts and minds in China.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.620
 You don't see it in North Korea.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.620
 You don't see it in Congo.

24:19.620 --> 24:22.620
 You don't see it in most of the world.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.620
 Hearts and minds are a luxury.

24:24.620 --> 24:26.620
 In reality, what people need is food, water, power.

24:26.620 --> 24:30.620
 They need income to be able to secure a lifestyle.

24:30.620 --> 24:33.620
 It is absolutely sad.

24:33.620 --> 24:40.620
 I am not in any way, shape or form saying that my assessment on this

24:40.620 --> 24:45.620
 is enriching or enlightening or hopeful.

24:45.620 --> 24:48.620
 It's just fact.

24:48.620 --> 24:51.620
 It's just calculatable empirical evidence.

24:51.620 --> 24:56.620
 If Putin loses in Ukraine, the losses, the influential losses,

24:56.620 --> 25:02.620
 the economic losses, the lives lost, the power lost is too great.

25:02.620 --> 25:07.620
 It is better for him to push and push and push through war crimes

25:07.620 --> 25:08.620
 through everything else.

25:08.620 --> 25:11.620
 War crimes are something defined by the international court system.

25:11.620 --> 25:15.620
 The international court system has Russia as part of its board.

25:15.620 --> 25:19.620
 The international court system is largely powerless

25:19.620 --> 25:22.620
 when it comes to enforcing its own outcomes.

25:22.620 --> 25:30.620
 The real risk gain scenario here for Russia is significantly

25:30.620 --> 25:33.620
 in favor of gain over risk.

25:33.620 --> 25:37.620
 The other thing that I think is important to talk about is we,

25:37.620 --> 25:42.620
 everybody is trapped in the middle of a gigantic information war.

25:42.620 --> 25:45.620
 Yes, there's battlefield bullets and cannons and tanks,

25:45.620 --> 25:48.620
 but there's also a massive informational war.

25:48.620 --> 25:56.620
 The same narrative that you see these Russian ground troops

25:56.620 --> 25:59.620
 in Ukraine believing they're clearing the land of Nazis,

25:59.620 --> 26:04.620
 that information is being fed to them from their own home country.

26:04.620 --> 26:07.620
 I don't know why people seem to think that the information

26:07.620 --> 26:10.620
 that they're reading in English is any more or less true.

26:10.620 --> 26:13.620
 Every piece of news coming out of the West,

26:13.620 --> 26:16.620
 every piece of information coming out in the English language

26:16.620 --> 26:21.620
 is also a giant narrative being shared intentionally

26:21.620 --> 26:24.620
 to try to undermine the morale and the faithfulness

26:24.620 --> 26:26.620
 of English speaking Russians,

26:26.620 --> 26:29.620
 which somebody somewhere knows exactly how many of those there are.

26:29.620 --> 26:32.620
 So we have to recognize that we're not getting true information

26:32.620 --> 26:35.620
 from other side because there is a strategic value

26:35.620 --> 26:37.620
 in making sure that there is just the right amount

26:37.620 --> 26:40.620
 of mis or disinformation out there.

26:40.620 --> 26:42.620
 Not because someone's trying to lie to Americans,

26:42.620 --> 26:44.620
 but because someone is trying to influence

26:44.620 --> 26:47.620
 the way English speaking Russians think.

26:47.620 --> 26:51.620
 In that world, that's exactly why you see so many news articles

26:51.620 --> 26:54.620
 cited to anonymous sources,

26:54.620 --> 26:56.620
 government officials who do not want to be named.

26:56.620 --> 26:59.620
 There's nothing that links back responsibility there.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.620
 There's nothing that can go to court there,

27:01.620 --> 27:04.620
 but the information still gets released.

27:04.620 --> 27:07.620
 That's enough to make Ukrainians believe

27:07.620 --> 27:09.620
 that the United States is going to help them

27:09.620 --> 27:11.620
 or that the West is going to help them.

27:11.620 --> 27:15.620
 To make Russians think that they're going to lose,

27:15.620 --> 27:17.620
 and maybe they should just give up now

27:17.620 --> 27:19.620
 and leave from the battlefield now.

27:19.620 --> 27:21.620
 We have to understand we are in the middle

27:21.620 --> 27:23.620
 of a giant information war.

27:23.620 --> 27:25.620
 Maybe you can correct me,

27:25.620 --> 27:27.620
 but it feels like in the English speaking world,

27:27.620 --> 27:29.620
 it's harder to control.

27:29.620 --> 27:31.620
 It's harder to fight the information war

27:31.620 --> 27:34.620
 because of, you know, some people say

27:34.620 --> 27:37.620
 there's not really a freedom of speech in this country,

27:37.620 --> 27:39.620
 but I think if you compare,

27:39.620 --> 27:41.620
 there's a lot more freedom of speech,

27:41.620 --> 27:43.620
 and it's just harder to control narratives

27:43.620 --> 27:47.620
 when there's a bunch of guerrilla journalists

27:47.620 --> 27:49.620
 that are able to just publish anything they want

27:49.620 --> 27:51.620
 on Twitter or anything.

27:51.620 --> 27:53.620
 It's just harder to control narratives.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.620
 So people don't understand where freedom of speech is.

27:55.620 --> 27:57.620
 That's the first major problem,

27:57.620 --> 27:59.620
 and it's shameful how many people in the United States

27:59.620 --> 28:02.620
 do not understand what freedom of speech actually protects.

28:02.620 --> 28:05.620
 So that aside, you're absolutely right.

28:05.620 --> 28:08.620
 Fighting the information war in the West

28:08.620 --> 28:10.620
 is extremely difficult

28:10.620 --> 28:13.620
 because anyone with a blog,

28:13.620 --> 28:16.620
 anyone with a Twitter account, anyone...

28:16.620 --> 28:18.620
 I mean, anyone can call themselves a journalist, essentially.

28:18.620 --> 28:20.620
 We live in a world, we live in a country

28:20.620 --> 28:22.620
 where people read the headline

28:22.620 --> 28:25.620
 and they completely bypass the author line,

28:25.620 --> 28:27.620
 and they go straight into the content,

28:27.620 --> 28:29.620
 and then they decide whether the content's real or not

28:29.620 --> 28:31.620
 based on how they feel,

28:31.620 --> 28:34.620
 instead of based on empirical, measurable evidence.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.620
 So you mentioned the Lonely Sect

28:36.620 --> 28:39.620
 and the support of the United States,

28:39.620 --> 28:41.620
 support of Ukraine by the United States.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.620
 Are you skeptical to the level of support

28:44.620 --> 28:46.620
 that the United States is providing

28:46.620 --> 28:49.620
 and is going to provide over time?

28:49.620 --> 28:51.620
 The strategy that the United States has taken

28:51.620 --> 28:53.620
 to support Ukraine is similar to the strategy

28:53.620 --> 28:56.620
 we took to support Great Britain during World War II.

28:56.620 --> 28:59.620
 The enactment of the Lenly Sect is a perfect example of that.

28:59.620 --> 29:02.620
 The Lenly Sect means that we are lending

29:02.620 --> 29:05.620
 or leasing equipment to the Ukrainian government

29:05.620 --> 29:08.620
 in exchange for future payment.

29:08.620 --> 29:10.620
 So every time a rocket is launched,

29:10.620 --> 29:12.620
 every time a drone crashes into a tank,

29:12.620 --> 29:17.620
 that's a bill that Ukraine is just racking up.

29:17.620 --> 29:19.620
 It's like when you go to a restaurant

29:19.620 --> 29:21.620
 and you start drinking shots.

29:21.620 --> 29:23.620
 Sometime the bill will come due.

29:23.620 --> 29:25.620
 This is exactly what we did when Europe

29:25.620 --> 29:29.620
 and when Great Britain was in the face of Nazi invasion.

29:29.620 --> 29:31.620
 We signed the same thing into motion.

29:31.620 --> 29:34.620
 Do you know that the UK did not pay off the debt

29:34.620 --> 29:37.620
 from World War II until 2020?

29:37.620 --> 29:41.620
 They've been paying that debt since the end of World War II.

29:41.620 --> 29:44.620
 So what we're doing is we're indebting Ukraine

29:44.620 --> 29:48.620
 against the promise that perhaps they will secure their freedom,

29:48.620 --> 29:50.620
 which nobody seems to want to talk about

29:50.620 --> 29:52.620
 what freedom is actually going to look like for Ukrainians.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.620
 What are the true handful of outcomes,

29:55.620 --> 29:57.620
 the realistic outcomes that could come of this

29:57.620 --> 30:00.620
 and which of those outcomes really looks like freedom to them,

30:00.620 --> 30:02.620
 especially in the face of the fact

30:02.620 --> 30:05.620
 that they're going to be trillions of dollars in debt

30:05.620 --> 30:09.620
 to the West for supplying them with the training

30:09.620 --> 30:11.620
 and the weapons and the food and the med kits

30:11.620 --> 30:13.620
 and everything else that we're giving them,

30:13.620 --> 30:14.620
 because none of it's free.

30:14.620 --> 30:16.620
 It's all coming due.

30:16.620 --> 30:20.620
 We're a democracy, but we're also a capitalist country.

30:20.620 --> 30:23.620
 We can't afford to just give things away for free,

30:23.620 --> 30:25.620
 but we can give things away at a discount.

30:25.620 --> 30:27.620
 We can give things away, lay away,

30:27.620 --> 30:29.620
 but the bill will come due.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.620
 Unfortunately, that is not part of the conversation

30:31.620 --> 30:33.620
 being had with the American people.

30:33.620 --> 30:37.620
 Debt is a way to establish some level of control.

30:37.620 --> 30:39.620
 Power is power.

30:39.620 --> 30:43.620
 That said, having a very close relationship

30:43.620 --> 30:45.620
 between Ukraine and the United States

30:45.620 --> 30:50.620
 does not seem to be a negative possibility

30:50.620 --> 30:52.620
 when Ukrainians think about their future

30:52.620 --> 30:54.620
 in terms of freedom.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.620
 That's one thing.

30:56.620 --> 30:59.620
 There's some aspect of this war that I've just noticed

30:59.620 --> 31:02.620
 and one of the people I talked to said

31:02.620 --> 31:08.620
 that all great nations have an independence war,

31:08.620 --> 31:10.620
 have to have a war for their independence.

31:10.620 --> 31:12.620
 In order, there's something, it's dark,

31:12.620 --> 31:15.620
 but there's something about war

31:15.620 --> 31:19.620
 just being a catalyst for finding your own identity as a nation.

31:19.620 --> 31:22.620
 You can have leaders, you can have signed documents,

31:22.620 --> 31:24.620
 you can have all this kind of stuff,

31:24.620 --> 31:25.620
 but there's something about war

31:25.620 --> 31:27.620
 that really brings the country together

31:27.620 --> 31:30.620
 and actually tried to figure out what is at the core

31:30.620 --> 31:33.620
 of the spirit of the people that defines this country.

31:33.620 --> 31:36.620
 They see this war as that,

31:36.620 --> 31:38.620
 as the independence war to define the heart

31:38.620 --> 31:40.620
 of what the country is.

31:40.620 --> 31:43.620
 There's been, before the war, before this invasion,

31:43.620 --> 31:46.620
 there was a lot of factions in the country.

31:46.620 --> 31:50.620
 There was a lot of influence from oligarchs

31:50.620 --> 31:52.620
 and corruption and so on.

31:52.620 --> 31:57.620
 The factions were brought together under one umbrella

31:57.620 --> 32:01.620
 effectively to become one nation because of this invasion.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.620
 They see that as a positive direction

32:04.620 --> 32:10.620
 for the defining of what a free democratic country looks like

32:10.620 --> 32:14.620
 after the war, in their perspective, after the war is won.

32:14.620 --> 32:16.620
 It's a difficult situation

32:16.620 --> 32:21.620
 because I'm trying to make sure that you and everybody listening

32:21.620 --> 32:24.620
 understands that what's happening in Ukraine,

32:24.620 --> 32:29.620
 among Ukrainians, is noble and brave and courageous

32:29.620 --> 32:35.620
 and beyond the expectations of anyone.

32:35.620 --> 32:40.620
 The fact is there is no material support coming from the outside.

32:40.620 --> 32:44.620
 The American Revolution was won because of French involvement,

32:44.620 --> 32:47.620
 French ships, French troops, French generals,

32:47.620 --> 32:49.620
 French military might.

32:49.620 --> 32:54.620
 The independence of communist China was won

32:54.620 --> 32:57.620
 through Russian support, Russian generals,

32:57.620 --> 33:00.620
 Russian troops on the ground fighting with the communists.

33:00.620 --> 33:03.620
 That's how revolutions are won.

33:03.620 --> 33:05.620
 That's how independent countries are born.

33:05.620 --> 33:07.620
 Ukraine doesn't get any of that.

33:07.620 --> 33:09.620
 No one is stepping into that

33:09.620 --> 33:13.620
 because we live in a world right now

33:13.620 --> 33:17.620
 where there simply is no economic benefits

33:17.620 --> 33:21.620
 to the parties in power to support Ukraine to that level.

33:21.620 --> 33:24.620
 War is a game of economics.

33:24.620 --> 33:28.620
 The economic benefit of Ukraine is crystal clear

33:28.620 --> 33:31.620
 in favor of Russia, which is why Putin cannot lose.

33:31.620 --> 33:33.620
 He will not let himself lose.

33:33.620 --> 33:36.620
 Short of something completely unexpected.

33:36.620 --> 33:39.620
 I'm talking 60%, 70% probability Ukraine loses,

33:39.620 --> 33:42.620
 but there's still 20%, 30% probability

33:42.620 --> 33:44.620
 of the unimaginable happening.

33:44.620 --> 33:47.620
 Who knows what that might be? An oligarch assassinates Putin

33:47.620 --> 33:50.620
 or a nuclear bomb goes off somewhere.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.620
 Or who knows what, right?

33:52.620 --> 33:55.620
 There's still a chance that something unexpected will happen

33:55.620 --> 33:57.620
 and change the tide of the war.

33:57.620 --> 34:01.620
 But when it comes down to the core calculus here,

34:01.620 --> 34:05.620
 Ukraine is the agricultural bed to support a future Russia.

34:05.620 --> 34:09.620
 Russian knows they know they have to have Ukraine.

34:09.620 --> 34:11.620
 They know that they have to have it to protect themselves

34:11.620 --> 34:13.620
 against military pressure from the West.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.620
 They have to have it for agricultural reasons.

34:15.620 --> 34:19.620
 They have major oil on natural gas pipelines

34:19.620 --> 34:22.620
 that flow through eastern Ukraine.

34:22.620 --> 34:26.620
 They cannot let Ukraine fall outside of their sphere of influence.

34:26.620 --> 34:28.620
 They cannot.

34:28.620 --> 34:31.620
 The United States doesn't really have any

34:31.620 --> 34:33.620
 economic vested interests in Ukraine.

34:33.620 --> 34:37.620
 Ideological points of view and promises aside,

34:37.620 --> 34:39.620
 there's no economic benefit.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.620
 And the same thing goes for NATO.

34:41.620 --> 34:44.620
 NATO has no economic investments in Ukraine.

34:44.620 --> 34:49.620
 Ukrainian output, Ukrainian food,

34:49.620 --> 34:51.620
 goes to the Middle East and Africa.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.620
 It doesn't go to Europe.

34:53.620 --> 34:58.620
 So the whole, the West siding with Ukraine

34:58.620 --> 35:00.620
 is exclusively ideological

35:00.620 --> 35:02.620
 and it's putting them in a place

35:02.620 --> 35:04.620
 where they fight a war with Russia

35:04.620 --> 35:06.620
 so the whole world can see Russia's capabilities.

35:06.620 --> 35:09.620
 Ukraine is as sad as it is to say, man,

35:09.620 --> 35:14.620
 Ukraine is a pawn on a table for superpowers

35:14.620 --> 35:16.620
 to calculate each other's capacities.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.620
 Right now, we've only talked about Russia in the United States.

35:19.620 --> 35:21.620
 We haven't even talked about Iran.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.620
 We haven't even talked about China, right?

35:23.620 --> 35:25.620
 It is a pawn on a table.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.620
 This is a chicken fight so that people get to watch

35:27.620 --> 35:29.620
 and see what the other trainers are doing.

35:29.620 --> 35:31.620
 Well, a lot of people might have said the same thing

35:31.620 --> 35:34.620
 about the United States back in the independence fight.

35:34.620 --> 35:38.620
 So there is possibilities, as you've said,

35:38.620 --> 35:41.620
 we're not saying zero percent chance

35:41.620 --> 35:44.620
 and it could be a reasonably high percent chance

35:44.620 --> 35:47.620
 that this becomes one of the great democratic nations

35:47.620 --> 35:49.620
 that the 21st century is remembered by.

35:49.620 --> 35:50.620
 Absolutely.

35:50.620 --> 35:54.620
 And so you said American support,

35:54.620 --> 35:56.620
 so ideologically, first of all,

35:56.620 --> 36:02.620
 you don't assign much long term power to that,

36:02.620 --> 36:07.620
 that U.S. could support Ukraine purely on ideological grounds.

36:07.620 --> 36:11.620
 Just look in the last four years, the last three years.

36:11.620 --> 36:15.620
 Do you remember what happened in Hong Kong right before COVID?

36:15.620 --> 36:20.620
 China swooped into Hong Kong violently,

36:20.620 --> 36:22.620
 beating protesters, killing them in the street

36:22.620 --> 36:25.620
 and prisoning people without just cause.

36:25.620 --> 36:28.620
 And Hong Kong was a democracy

36:28.620 --> 36:31.620
 and the whole world stood by and let it happen.

36:31.620 --> 36:34.620
 And then what happened in Afghanistan just a year ago?

36:34.620 --> 36:38.620
 And the whole world stood by and let the Taliban take power again

36:38.620 --> 36:40.620
 after 20 years of loss.

36:40.620 --> 36:45.620
 This, we are showing a repeatable point of view.

36:45.620 --> 36:50.620
 We will talk American politicians, American administrations.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.620
 We will say a lot of things.

36:52.620 --> 36:55.620
 We will promise a lot of ideological, pro democracy,

36:55.620 --> 36:57.620
 rah rah statements.

36:57.620 --> 36:58.620
 We will say it.

36:58.620 --> 37:01.620
 But when it comes down to putting our own people,

37:01.620 --> 37:06.620
 our own economy, our own GDP at risk,

37:06.620 --> 37:08.620
 we step away from that fight.

37:08.620 --> 37:12.620
 America is currently supplying military equipment to Ukraine.

37:12.620 --> 37:13.620
 Absolutely.

37:13.620 --> 37:15.620
 And a lot of that military equipment has actually been

37:15.620 --> 37:19.620
 the thing that turned the tides of war a couple of times already.

37:19.620 --> 37:22.620
 Currently, that's the high march systems.

37:22.620 --> 37:26.620
 So you mentioned sort of that Putin can't afford to lose,

37:26.620 --> 37:29.620
 but winning can look in different ways.

37:29.620 --> 37:31.620
 So you've kind of defined so on.

37:31.620 --> 37:35.620
 At this moment, the prediction is that winning

37:35.620 --> 37:38.620
 looks like capturing not just the east,

37:38.620 --> 37:40.620
 but the south of Ukraine.

37:40.620 --> 37:45.620
 But you can have narratives of winning that return back

37:45.620 --> 37:48.620
 to the, what was at the beginning of this year

37:48.620 --> 37:49.620
 before the invasion.

37:49.620 --> 37:50.620
 Correct.

37:50.620 --> 37:53.620
 That Crimea is still with Russia.

37:53.620 --> 37:56.620
 There's some kind of negotiated thing about Donbas,

37:56.620 --> 37:59.620
 where it still stays with Ukraine, but there are some.

37:59.620 --> 38:00.620
 Public government.

38:00.620 --> 38:01.620
 Yeah.

38:01.620 --> 38:03.620
 Just like that's what they have in Georgia right now.

38:03.620 --> 38:07.620
 And that could still be defined through mechanisms.

38:07.620 --> 38:08.620
 As Russia winning.

38:08.620 --> 38:09.620
 As Russia winning for Russia.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.620
 And then for Ukraine as Ukraine winning.

38:12.620 --> 38:16.620
 And for the west as democracy winning.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.620
 And you kind of negotiate.

38:18.620 --> 38:22.620
 I mean, that seems to be how geopolitics works.

38:22.620 --> 38:25.620
 Everybody can walk away with a win, win story.

38:25.620 --> 38:28.620
 And then the world progresses with the lessons learned.

38:28.620 --> 38:29.620
 That's the high likely.

38:29.620 --> 38:31.620
 That's the most probable outcome.

38:31.620 --> 38:35.620
 The most probable outcome is that Ukraine remains

38:35.620 --> 38:38.620
 in air quotes, a sovereign nation.

38:38.620 --> 38:43.620
 It's not going to be truly sovereign because it will become,

38:43.620 --> 38:47.620
 it will have to have new government put in place.

38:47.620 --> 38:50.620
 Zelensky will, it's extremely unlikely he will be president

38:50.620 --> 38:53.620
 because he has gone too far to demonstrate

38:53.620 --> 38:56.620
 his power over the people and his ability

38:56.620 --> 38:58.620
 to separate the Ukrainian people

38:58.620 --> 39:01.620
 from the autocratic power of Russia.

39:01.620 --> 39:05.620
 So he would have to be unseated, whether he goes into exile

39:05.620 --> 39:08.620
 or whether he is peacefully left alone

39:08.620 --> 39:10.620
 is all going to be part of the negotiations.

39:10.620 --> 39:15.620
 But the thing to keep in mind also is that a negotiated peace

39:15.620 --> 39:17.620
 really just means a negotiated ceasefire.

39:17.620 --> 39:18.620
 We've seen this happen all over the world.

39:18.620 --> 39:20.620
 North Korea and South Korea are technically still

39:20.620 --> 39:22.620
 just a negotiated cease power.

39:22.620 --> 39:26.620
 What you end up having is Russia will allow Ukraine

39:26.620 --> 39:29.620
 to call itself Ukraine to operate independently

39:29.620 --> 39:31.620
 to have their own debt to the United States.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.620
 Russia doesn't want to take on that debt.

39:33.620 --> 39:38.620
 And then in exchange for that, they will have firmer guidelines

39:38.620 --> 39:41.620
 as to how NATO can engage with Ukraine.

39:41.620 --> 39:42.620
 And then that becomes an example

39:42.620 --> 39:44.620
 for all the other former Soviet satellite states,

39:44.620 --> 39:47.620
 which are all required economically by Russia,

39:47.620 --> 39:50.620
 not required economically by the West.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.620
 And then you end up seeing how it just,

39:52.620 --> 39:54.620
 you can see how the whole thing plays out

39:54.620 --> 39:59.620
 once you realize that the keystone is Ukraine.

39:59.620 --> 40:01.620
 There is something about Ukraine,

40:01.620 --> 40:04.620
 the deep support by the Ukrainian people of America

40:04.620 --> 40:09.620
 that is in contrast with, for example, Afghanistan,

40:09.620 --> 40:13.620
 that it seems like, ideologically,

40:13.620 --> 40:16.620
 Ukraine could be a beacon of freedom

40:16.620 --> 40:19.620
 used in narratives by the United States

40:19.620 --> 40:23.620
 to fight geopolitical wars in that part of the world,

40:23.620 --> 40:25.620
 that they would be a good partner

40:25.620 --> 40:28.620
 for this idea of democracy, of freedom,

40:28.620 --> 40:31.620
 of all the values that America stands for.

40:31.620 --> 40:32.620
 They're a good partner.

40:32.620 --> 40:35.620
 And so it's valuable if you sort of have

40:35.620 --> 40:38.620
 a cynical, pragmatic view,

40:38.620 --> 40:40.620
 sort of like Henry Kissinger type of view,

40:40.620 --> 40:43.620
 it's valuable to have them as a partner,

40:43.620 --> 40:46.620
 so valuable that it makes sense to support them

40:46.620 --> 40:49.620
 in achieving a negotiated ceasefire

40:49.620 --> 40:51.620
 that's on the side of Ukraine.

40:51.620 --> 40:53.620
 But because of this particular leader,

40:53.620 --> 40:55.620
 this particular culture,

40:55.620 --> 40:59.620
 this particular dynamics of how the war enrolled

40:59.620 --> 41:01.620
 and things like Twitter

41:01.620 --> 41:04.620
 and the way digital communication currently works,

41:04.620 --> 41:07.620
 it just seems like this is a powerful symbol of freedom

41:07.620 --> 41:09.620
 that's useful for the United States

41:09.620 --> 41:12.620
 if we're sort of to take the pragmatic view.

41:12.620 --> 41:16.620
 Don't you think it's possible

41:16.620 --> 41:20.620
 that United States supports Ukraine

41:20.620 --> 41:22.620
 financially, militarily enough

41:22.620 --> 41:24.620
 for it to get an advantage in this war?

41:24.620 --> 41:26.620
 I think they've already gotten an advantage in the war.

41:26.620 --> 41:28.620
 The fact that the war is still going on

41:28.620 --> 41:30.620
 demonstrates the asymmetrical advantage.

41:30.620 --> 41:33.620
 The fact that Russia has stepped up

41:33.620 --> 41:36.620
 to the negotiating table with them several times

41:36.620 --> 41:40.620
 without just turning to Chechen,

41:40.620 --> 41:42.620
 I mean, you remember what happened in Chechnya,

41:42.620 --> 41:44.620
 without turning to Chechnya levels,

41:44.620 --> 41:47.620
 just mass blind destruction,

41:47.620 --> 41:50.620
 which was another Putin war.

41:50.620 --> 41:52.620
 To see that those things have happened

41:52.620 --> 41:55.620
 demonstrates the asymmetric advantage that the West has given.

41:55.620 --> 42:01.620
 I think the true way to look at the benefit of Ukraine

42:01.620 --> 42:06.620
 as a shining example of freedom in Europe for the West

42:06.620 --> 42:08.620
 isn't to understand whether or not they could,

42:08.620 --> 42:10.620
 they absolutely could.

42:10.620 --> 42:14.620
 It's the question of how valuable is that in Europe?

42:14.620 --> 42:16.620
 How valuable is Ukraine?

42:16.620 --> 42:21.620
 Before February, nobody even thought about Ukraine,

42:21.620 --> 42:23.620
 and the people who did know about Ukraine

42:23.620 --> 42:28.620
 knew that it was an extremely corrupt former Soviet state

42:28.620 --> 42:30.620
 with 20% of its national population

42:30.620 --> 42:32.620
 self identifying as Russian.

42:32.620 --> 42:34.620
 There's a reason Putin went into Ukraine.

42:34.620 --> 42:36.620
 There's a reason he's been promising

42:36.620 --> 42:39.620
 he would go into Ukraine for the better part of a decade,

42:39.620 --> 42:43.620
 because the circumstances were aligned.

42:43.620 --> 42:45.620
 It was a corrupt country that self identified

42:45.620 --> 42:47.620
 as Russian in many ways.

42:47.620 --> 42:51.620
 It was supposed to be an easier of multiple marks

42:51.620 --> 42:55.620
 in terms of the former Soviet satellite states to go after.

42:55.620 --> 42:57.620
 That's all part of the miscalculation

42:57.620 --> 42:59.620
 that the rest of the world saw too

42:59.620 --> 43:02.620
 when we thought it would fall quickly.

43:02.620 --> 43:05.620
 So the think that it could be a shining example of freedom

43:05.620 --> 43:09.620
 is accurate, but is it as shining a star as Germany?

43:09.620 --> 43:11.620
 Is it as shining a star as the UK?

43:11.620 --> 43:13.620
 Is it as shining a star as Romania?

43:13.620 --> 43:16.620
 Is it as shining a star as France?

43:16.620 --> 43:22.620
 It's got a lot of democratic freedom based countries in Europe

43:22.620 --> 43:26.620
 to compete against to be the shining stellar example.

43:26.620 --> 43:29.620
 In exchange, on counterpoint to that,

43:29.620 --> 43:32.620
 it has an extreme amount of strategic value to Russia,

43:32.620 --> 43:35.620
 which has no interest in making it a shining star

43:35.620 --> 43:37.620
 of the example of democracy and freedom.

43:37.620 --> 43:40.620
 Outside of research in terms of the shininess of the star,

43:40.620 --> 43:42.620
 I would argue yes.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.620
 If you look at how much it captivated the attention of the world.

43:45.620 --> 43:48.620
 The attention of the world has made no material difference, man.

43:48.620 --> 43:49.620
 That's what I'm saying.

43:49.620 --> 43:56.620
 That's your estimation, but are you sure we can convert that

43:56.620 --> 43:59.620
 into political influence, into money?

43:59.620 --> 44:02.620
 Don't you think attention is money?

44:02.620 --> 44:06.620
 Attention is money in democracies and capitalist countries.

44:06.620 --> 44:07.620
 Yes.

44:07.620 --> 44:10.620
 Which serves as a counterweight to authoritarian regimes.

44:10.620 --> 44:13.620
 For Putin, resources matter.

44:13.620 --> 44:15.620
 For the United States, also resources matter,

44:15.620 --> 44:20.620
 but the attention and the belief that people also matter

44:20.620 --> 44:23.620
 because that's how you attain and maintain political power.

44:23.620 --> 44:26.620
 Going to that exact example,

44:26.620 --> 44:29.620
 then I would highlight that our current administration

44:29.620 --> 44:33.620
 has the lowest approval ratings of any president in history.

44:33.620 --> 44:36.620
 If people were very fond of the war going on in Ukraine,

44:36.620 --> 44:39.620
 wouldn't that counterbalance some of our upset,

44:39.620 --> 44:41.620
 some of the dissent coming from the economy

44:41.620 --> 44:45.620
 and some of the dissent coming from the great recession

44:45.620 --> 44:49.620
 or the great resignation and whatever is happening

44:49.620 --> 44:51.620
 with the drawout, with the down stock market.

44:51.620 --> 44:54.620
 You would think that people would feel like they're sacrificing for something.

44:54.620 --> 44:57.620
 If they really believed that Ukraine mattered,

44:57.620 --> 45:00.620
 that they would stand next to the president

45:00.620 --> 45:06.620
 who is so staunchly driving and leading the West against this conflict.

45:06.620 --> 45:09.620
 Well, I think the opposition to this particular president,

45:09.620 --> 45:12.620
 I personally believe has less to do with the policies

45:12.620 --> 45:18.620
 and more to do with a lot of the other human factors.

45:18.620 --> 45:20.620
 But again, empirically,

45:20.620 --> 45:23.620
 I look at things through a very empirical lens,

45:23.620 --> 45:26.620
 a very cold fact based lens.

45:26.620 --> 45:29.620
 And there are multiple data points that suggest

45:29.620 --> 45:33.620
 that the American people ideologically sympathize with Ukraine,

45:33.620 --> 45:35.620
 but they really just want their gas prices to go down.

45:35.620 --> 45:37.620
 They really just want to be able to pay less money

45:37.620 --> 45:39.620
 at the grocery store for their food.

45:39.620 --> 45:42.620
 And they most definitely don't want their sons and daughters

45:42.620 --> 45:45.620
 to die in exchange for Ukrainian freedom.

45:45.620 --> 45:49.620
 It does hurt me to see the politicization of this war as well.

45:49.620 --> 45:54.620
 I think that maybe has to do with the kind of calculation

45:54.620 --> 45:58.620
 you're referring to, but it seems like it doesn't.

45:58.620 --> 46:00.620
 It seems like there's a cynical,

46:00.620 --> 46:04.620
 whatever takes attention of the media for the moment,

46:04.620 --> 46:08.620
 the red team chooses one side and the blue team chooses another.

46:08.620 --> 46:11.620
 And then I think, correct me if I'm wrong,

46:11.620 --> 46:17.620
 but I believe the Democrats went into full support of Ukraine

46:17.620 --> 46:19.620
 on the ideological side.

46:19.620 --> 46:21.620
 And then I guess Republicans are saying,

46:21.620 --> 46:22.620
 why are we wasting money?

46:22.620 --> 46:25.620
 The gas prices are growing up.

46:25.620 --> 46:27.620
 That's a very crude kind of analysis,

46:27.620 --> 46:30.620
 but they basically picked whatever argument on whatever side

46:30.620 --> 46:35.620
 and now more and more and more this particular war in Ukraine

46:35.620 --> 46:39.620
 is becoming a kind of pawn in the game of politics

46:39.620 --> 46:42.620
 that's first the midterm elections,

46:42.620 --> 46:44.620
 then building up towards the presidential elections

46:44.620 --> 46:49.620
 and stops being about the philosophical, the social,

46:49.620 --> 46:53.620
 the geopolitical aspects, parameters of this war,

46:53.620 --> 46:56.620
 and more about just like whatever the heck captivates Twitter

46:56.620 --> 46:58.620
 and we're going to use that for politics.

46:58.620 --> 47:01.620
 You're right in the sense of the fact that it's...

47:01.620 --> 47:03.620
 I wouldn't say that the red team and the blue team

47:03.620 --> 47:05.620
 picked opposite sides on this.

47:05.620 --> 47:08.620
 What I would say is that media discovered

47:08.620 --> 47:11.620
 that talking about Ukraine wasn't as profitable

47:11.620 --> 47:13.620
 as talking about something else.

47:13.620 --> 47:17.620
 People simply, the American people who read media

47:17.620 --> 47:20.620
 or who watch media, they simply became bored

47:20.620 --> 47:23.620
 reading about news that didn't seem to be changing much.

47:23.620 --> 47:27.620
 And we turned back into wanting to read about our own economy

47:27.620 --> 47:29.620
 and we wanted to hear more about cryptocurrency

47:29.620 --> 47:31.620
 and we wanted to hear more about the Kardashians

47:31.620 --> 47:33.620
 and that's what we care about, so that's what media writes about.

47:33.620 --> 47:37.620
 That's how a capitalist market driven world works

47:37.620 --> 47:38.620
 and that's how the United States works.

47:38.620 --> 47:40.620
 That's why in both red papers and blue papers,

47:40.620 --> 47:42.620
 red sources and blue sources,

47:42.620 --> 47:44.620
 you don't see Ukraine being mentioned very much.

47:44.620 --> 47:46.620
 If anything, I would say that your Republicans

47:46.620 --> 47:49.620
 are probably more in support of what's happening in Ukraine

47:49.620 --> 47:51.620
 right now because we're creating new weapons systems.

47:51.620 --> 47:53.620
 Our military is getting stronger.

47:53.620 --> 47:54.620
 We're sending these...

47:54.620 --> 47:59.620
 We get to test military systems in combat in Ukraine.

47:59.620 --> 48:04.620
 That's priceless in the world of the military industrial complex.

48:04.620 --> 48:09.620
 Being able to field test, combat test a weapon

48:09.620 --> 48:13.620
 without having to sacrifice your own people is incredibly valuable.

48:13.620 --> 48:15.620
 You get all the data, you get all the performance metrics

48:15.620 --> 48:17.620
 but you don't have to put yourself at risk.

48:17.620 --> 48:20.620
 That is one of the major benefits of what we're seeing

48:20.620 --> 48:23.620
 from supporting Ukraine with weapons and with troops.

48:23.620 --> 48:26.620
 The long term benefit to what will come of this

48:26.620 --> 48:30.620
 for the United States, practically speaking,

48:30.620 --> 48:34.620
 in the lens of national security, through military readiness,

48:34.620 --> 48:38.620
 through future economic benefits, those are super strong.

48:38.620 --> 48:41.620
 The geopolitical fight is essentially moot

48:41.620 --> 48:44.620
 because Ukraine is not a geopolitical player.

48:44.620 --> 48:49.620
 It was not for 70 years and after this conflict is over,

48:49.620 --> 48:50.620
 it will not again.

48:50.620 --> 48:52.620
 Just think about what you were just saying

48:52.620 --> 48:55.620
 with the American people's attention span to Twitter

48:55.620 --> 48:56.620
 and whatever is currently going on.

48:56.620 --> 49:00.620
 If the Ukraine conflict resolved itself today in either...

49:00.620 --> 49:03.620
 In any direction, how many weeks do you think

49:03.620 --> 49:05.620
 before no one talked about Ukraine anymore?

49:05.620 --> 49:07.620
 Do you think we would make it two weeks?

49:07.620 --> 49:09.620
 Or do you think we'd make it maybe seven days?

49:09.620 --> 49:12.620
 It would be headline news for one or two days

49:12.620 --> 49:14.620
 and then we'd be onto something else.

49:14.620 --> 49:19.620
 It's just an unfortunate reality of how the world works

49:19.620 --> 49:22.620
 in a capitalist democracy.

49:22.620 --> 49:27.620
 Yeah, it just breaks my heart how much...

49:27.620 --> 49:31.620
 I know that there's Yemen and Syria

49:31.620 --> 49:33.620
 that nobody talks about anymore.

49:33.620 --> 49:36.620
 Still raging conflicts going on.

49:36.620 --> 49:41.620
 It just breaks my heart how much generational hatred is born.

49:41.620 --> 49:44.620
 I happen to be from...

49:44.620 --> 49:47.620
 My family is from Ukraine and from Russia

49:47.620 --> 49:50.620
 and so for me, just personally, it's a part of the world

49:50.620 --> 49:53.620
 I care about in terms of its history.

49:53.620 --> 49:56.620
 Because I speak the language,

49:56.620 --> 49:58.620
 I can appreciate the beauty of the literature,

49:58.620 --> 50:02.620
 the music, the art, the cultural history of the 20th century,

50:02.620 --> 50:06.620
 through all the dark times, through all the hell

50:06.620 --> 50:10.620
 of the dark sides of authoritarian regimes,

50:10.620 --> 50:12.620
 the destruction of war.

50:12.620 --> 50:14.620
 There's still just the beauty that I'm able to appreciate,

50:14.620 --> 50:18.620
 that I can't appreciate about China, Brazil, other countries

50:18.620 --> 50:20.620
 because I don't speak their language.

50:20.620 --> 50:22.620
 This one I can appreciate and so in that way,

50:22.620 --> 50:25.620
 this is personally really painful to me to see

50:25.620 --> 50:28.620
 so much of that history, the beauty in that history

50:28.620 --> 50:31.620
 suffocated by the hatred that is born

50:31.620 --> 50:35.620
 in a kind of geopolitical game

50:35.620 --> 50:39.620
 fought mostly by the politicians, the leaders.

50:39.620 --> 50:42.620
 People are beautiful and that's what you're talking about.

50:42.620 --> 50:46.620
 People are just beautiful creatures,

50:46.620 --> 50:51.620
 culture and art and science.

50:51.620 --> 50:53.620
 These are beautiful, beautiful things

50:53.620 --> 50:55.620
 that come about because of human beings

50:55.620 --> 50:59.620
 and the thing that gives me hope is that

50:59.620 --> 51:02.620
 no matter what conflict the world has seen,

51:02.620 --> 51:05.620
 and we've seen some devastating, horrible crimes

51:05.620 --> 51:07.620
 against humanity already.

51:07.620 --> 51:09.620
 We saw nuclear bombs go off in Japan.

51:09.620 --> 51:13.620
 We saw genocide happen in Rwanda.

51:13.620 --> 51:15.620
 We've seen horrible things happen,

51:15.620 --> 51:17.620
 but people persevere.

51:17.620 --> 51:21.620
 Language, culture, arts, science, they all persevere.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.620
 They all shine through.

51:23.620 --> 51:25.620
 Some of the most people don't even realize

51:25.620 --> 51:28.620
 how gorgeous the architecture and the culture is inside Iran.

51:28.620 --> 51:31.620
 People have no idea.

51:31.620 --> 51:35.620
 Chinese people in the rural parts of China

51:35.620 --> 51:39.620
 are some of the kindest, most amazing people you'll ever meet.

51:39.620 --> 51:44.620
 Korean art and Korean dance, Korean drumming.

51:44.620 --> 51:47.620
 Nobody has ever even heard of Korean drumming.

51:47.620 --> 51:50.620
 Korean drumming is this magical, beautiful thing.

51:50.620 --> 51:54.620
 In North Korea, does it better than anybody in the world?

51:54.620 --> 51:57.620
 Taekwondo in North Korea is just exceptional to watch.

51:57.620 --> 51:59.620
 In North Korea?

51:59.620 --> 52:00.620
 Nobody knows these things.

52:00.620 --> 52:02.620
 How do you know about Taekwondo in North Korea?

52:02.620 --> 52:04.620
 I have questions.

52:04.620 --> 52:06.620
 That's fascinating.

52:06.620 --> 52:08.620
 People don't think about that, but the culture,

52:08.620 --> 52:10.620
 the beauty of the people still flourishes

52:10.620 --> 52:12.620
 even in the toughest of places.

52:12.620 --> 52:14.620
 Absolutely, and we always will.

52:14.620 --> 52:16.620
 We always will because that is what people do.

52:16.620 --> 52:18.620
 That is just the truth of it.

52:18.620 --> 52:20.620
 It breaks my heart to see travesties

52:20.620 --> 52:23.620
 that people commit against people.

52:23.620 --> 52:26.620
 Whether you're looking at a micro level,

52:26.620 --> 52:29.620
 like what happens with shootings here in the United States,

52:29.620 --> 52:31.620
 or whether you look at a macro level,

52:31.620 --> 52:34.620
 like geopolitical power exchanges

52:34.620 --> 52:37.620
 and intra and interstate conflicts,

52:37.620 --> 52:39.620
 like what you see in Syria and what you see in Ukraine,

52:39.620 --> 52:41.620
 those are disgusting, terrible things.

52:41.620 --> 52:43.620
 War is a terrible thing.

52:43.620 --> 52:46.620
 That is a famous quote.

52:46.620 --> 52:49.620
 But people will persevere.

52:49.620 --> 52:52.620
 People will come through.

52:52.620 --> 52:54.620
 I hope so.

52:54.620 --> 52:58.620
 And I hope we don't do something

52:58.620 --> 53:02.620
 that I'll probably also ask you about later on

53:02.620 --> 53:07.620
 is things that destroy the possibility of perseverance,

53:07.620 --> 53:09.620
 which is things like nuclear war,

53:09.620 --> 53:13.620
 things that can do such tremendous damage

53:13.620 --> 53:16.620
 that we will never recover.

53:16.620 --> 53:21.620
 But yeah, I amidst your pragmatic pessimism,

53:21.620 --> 53:25.620
 I think both you and I have a kind of maybe small flame

53:25.620 --> 53:27.620
 of optimism in there about the perseverance

53:27.620 --> 53:29.620
 of the human species in general.

53:29.620 --> 53:33.620
 Let me ask you about intelligence agencies

53:33.620 --> 53:36.620
 outside of the CIA.

53:36.620 --> 53:40.620
 Can you illuminate what is the most powerful

53:40.620 --> 53:43.620
 intelligence agency in the world?

53:43.620 --> 53:47.620
 The CIA, the FSB, formerly the KGB, the MI6,

53:47.620 --> 53:52.620
 Mossad, I've gotten a chance to interact with a lot of Israelis

53:52.620 --> 53:55.620
 while in Ukraine, just incredible people.

53:55.620 --> 53:58.620
 In terms of both training and skill,

53:58.620 --> 54:03.620
 American soldiers too, just American military is incredible.

54:03.620 --> 54:07.620
 The competence and skill of the military,

54:07.620 --> 54:10.620
 the United States, Israeli I got to interact,

54:10.620 --> 54:12.620
 and Ukrainian as well.

54:12.620 --> 54:13.620
 It's striking.

54:13.620 --> 54:14.620
 It's striking, it's beautiful.

54:14.620 --> 54:15.620
 I just love people.

54:15.620 --> 54:18.620
 I love carpenters or people that are just extremely good

54:18.620 --> 54:21.620
 at their job and that take pride in their craftsmanship.

54:21.620 --> 54:22.620
 It's as beautiful to see.

54:22.620 --> 54:24.620
 And I imagine the same kind of thing happens

54:24.620 --> 54:26.620
 inside of intelligence agencies as well

54:26.620 --> 54:29.620
 that we don't get to appreciate because of the secrecy.

54:29.620 --> 54:31.620
 Same thing with like Lockheed Martin.

54:31.620 --> 54:33.620
 I interviewed the CTO of Lockheed Martin.

54:33.620 --> 54:37.620
 It breaks my heart as a person who loves engineering

54:37.620 --> 54:40.620
 because of the cover of secrecy.

54:40.620 --> 54:42.620
 We'll never get to know some of the incredible engineering

54:42.620 --> 54:45.620
 that happens inside of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

54:45.620 --> 54:46.620
 Boeing, Raytheon.

54:46.620 --> 54:47.620
 Yeah.

54:47.620 --> 54:50.620
 There's kind of this idea that these are people

54:50.620 --> 54:53.620
 who have conspiracy theories and kind of assign evil

54:53.620 --> 54:56.620
 to these companies in some part.

54:56.620 --> 54:58.620
 But I think there's beautiful people inside those companies,

54:58.620 --> 55:02.620
 brilliant people and some incredible science

55:02.620 --> 55:04.620
 and engineering is happening there.

55:04.620 --> 55:08.620
 Anyway, that said, the CIA, the FSB, the MI6,

55:08.620 --> 55:12.620
 Mossad, China, I know very little about the...

55:12.620 --> 55:14.620
 MSS, Ministry of State Security.

55:14.620 --> 55:17.620
 I don't know how much you know.

55:17.620 --> 55:19.620
 Or just other intelligence agencies.

55:19.620 --> 55:21.620
 In India, Pakistan, I've also heard...

55:21.620 --> 55:22.620
 Yeah.

55:22.620 --> 55:26.620
 Ra is powerful and so is ISSI.

55:26.620 --> 55:29.620
 And then, of course, European nations in Germany and France.

55:29.620 --> 55:30.620
 France.

55:30.620 --> 55:31.620
 Yeah.

55:31.620 --> 55:33.620
 So what can you say about the power,

55:33.620 --> 55:35.620
 the influence of the different intelligence agencies

55:35.620 --> 55:37.620
 within their nation and outside?

55:37.620 --> 55:38.620
 Yeah.

55:38.620 --> 55:41.620
 So to answer your question, your original question,

55:41.620 --> 55:43.620
 which is the most powerful, I'm going to have to give you

55:43.620 --> 55:44.620
 a few different answers.

55:44.620 --> 55:49.620
 So the most powerful intelligence organization in the world

55:49.620 --> 55:52.620
 in terms of reach is the Chinese MSS,

55:52.620 --> 55:54.620
 the Ministry of State Security.

55:54.620 --> 55:59.620
 Because they have created a single,

55:59.620 --> 56:02.620
 solitary intelligence service that has global reach

56:02.620 --> 56:05.620
 and is integrated with Chinese culture.

56:05.620 --> 56:09.620
 So that essentially every Chinese person anywhere in the world

56:09.620 --> 56:11.620
 is an informant to the MSS.

56:11.620 --> 56:15.620
 Because that's their way of serving the Middle Kingdom,

56:15.620 --> 56:19.620
 Zhongguo, the central kingdom, the Chinese word for China.

56:19.620 --> 56:23.620
 So they're the strongest, they're the most powerful intelligence

56:23.620 --> 56:24.620
 service in terms of reach.

56:24.620 --> 56:27.620
 Most assets, most informants, most intelligence.

56:27.620 --> 56:29.620
 So it's as deeply integrated with the citizenry.

56:29.620 --> 56:30.620
 Correct with their culture.

56:30.620 --> 56:32.620
 You know what a Chinese person who lives in Syria

56:32.620 --> 56:34.620
 thinks of themselves as?

56:34.620 --> 56:35.620
 A Chinese person.

56:35.620 --> 56:37.620
 Do you know what a Chinese person, a Chinese national

56:37.620 --> 56:39.620
 living in the United States thinks of themselves as?

56:39.620 --> 56:41.620
 A Chinese person, right?

56:41.620 --> 56:44.620
 Americans living abroad often think of ourselves as

56:44.620 --> 56:47.620
 expats, expatriates, living on the local economy,

56:47.620 --> 56:49.620
 embracing the local culture.

56:49.620 --> 56:52.620
 That is not how Chinese people view traveling around the world.

56:52.620 --> 56:56.620
 And by the way, if I may mention, I believe the way

56:56.620 --> 57:00.620
 Massad operates is a similar kind of thing

57:00.620 --> 57:04.620
 because people from Israel, living abroad,

57:04.620 --> 57:07.620
 still think of themselves as Jewish and Israeli.

57:07.620 --> 57:08.620
 First.

57:08.620 --> 57:09.620
 First.

57:09.620 --> 57:11.620
 So that allows you to integrate the culture.

57:11.620 --> 57:13.620
 And yep, the faith based aspects.

57:13.620 --> 57:14.620
 Exactly right.

57:14.620 --> 57:16.620
 But the number of people in Israel is much, much smaller.

57:16.620 --> 57:17.620
 Exactly right.

57:17.620 --> 57:18.620
 The number of people in China.

57:18.620 --> 57:20.620
 So when it comes to reach, China wins that game.

57:20.620 --> 57:21.620
 Yeah.

57:21.620 --> 57:25.620
 When it comes to professional capability, it's the CIA

57:25.620 --> 57:26.620
 by far.

57:26.620 --> 57:28.620
 Because budget wise, capability wise,

57:28.620 --> 57:30.620
 weapon system wise, modern technology wise,

57:30.620 --> 57:33.620
 CIA is the leader around the world.

57:33.620 --> 57:36.620
 Which is why every other intelligence organization out there

57:36.620 --> 57:38.620
 wants to partner with CIA.

57:38.620 --> 57:40.620
 They want to learn from CIA.

57:40.620 --> 57:41.620
 They want to train with CIA.

57:41.620 --> 57:44.620
 They want to, they want to partner on counter narcotics

57:44.620 --> 57:47.620
 and counter drug and counter terrorism and counter Uighur.

57:47.620 --> 57:48.620
 You name it.

57:48.620 --> 57:49.620
 People want to partner with CIA.

57:49.620 --> 57:53.620
 So CIA is the most powerful in terms of capability and wealth.

57:53.620 --> 57:56.620
 And then you've got the idea.

57:56.620 --> 57:59.620
 You've got tech.

57:59.620 --> 58:05.620
 So tech alone, meaning corporate espionage, economic espionage,

58:05.620 --> 58:08.620
 nothing beats, nothing beats DGSE in France.

58:08.620 --> 58:09.620
 They're the top.

58:09.620 --> 58:12.620
 They've got a massive budget that almost goes exclusively to

58:12.620 --> 58:14.620
 stealing foreign secrets.

58:14.620 --> 58:16.620
 They're the biggest threat to the United States,

58:16.620 --> 58:18.620
 even above Russia and above China.

58:18.620 --> 58:22.620
 DGSE in France is a massively powerful intelligence organization.

58:22.620 --> 58:27.620
 But they're so exclusively focused on a handful of types

58:27.620 --> 58:30.620
 of intelligence collection that nobody even really thinks

58:30.620 --> 58:31.620
 that they exist.

58:31.620 --> 58:35.620
 And then in terms of just terrifying violence,

58:35.620 --> 58:36.620
 you have Mossad.

58:36.620 --> 58:38.620
 Mossad will do anything.

58:38.620 --> 58:42.620
 Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes to ensure the survival

58:42.620 --> 58:45.620
 of every Israeli citizen around the world.

58:45.620 --> 58:48.620
 Most other countries will stop at some point,

58:48.620 --> 58:50.620
 but Mossad doesn't do that.

58:50.620 --> 58:53.620
 So it's the lines you're willing to cross.

58:53.620 --> 58:56.620
 And the reasons that you're willing to cross them.

58:56.620 --> 59:02.620
 CIA will let an American stay in jail in Russia unlawfully

59:02.620 --> 59:05.620
 and seek a diplomatic solution.

59:05.620 --> 59:08.620
 The United States has let people, there are two gentlemen

59:08.620 --> 59:12.620
 from the 1950s who were imprisoned in China for 20 years

59:12.620 --> 59:15.620
 waiting for diplomatic solutions to their release.

59:15.620 --> 59:23.620
 So we do not kill to save a citizen, but Mossad will.

59:23.620 --> 59:27.620
 And then they'll not just kill.

59:27.620 --> 59:30.620
 They'll do large scale infiltration.

59:30.620 --> 59:32.620
 They do amazing things.

59:32.620 --> 59:36.620
 They spare no expense because it's a demonstration

59:36.620 --> 59:37.620
 to their own people.

59:37.620 --> 59:39.620
 Again, going back to the whole idea of influence.

59:39.620 --> 59:44.620
 Every intelligence operation that sees the light of day

59:44.620 --> 59:46.620
 has two purposes.

59:46.620 --> 59:50.620
 The first purpose is the intelligence operation.

59:50.620 --> 59:52.620
 But if it was just the intelligence operation,

59:52.620 --> 59:54.620
 it would stay secret forever.

59:54.620 --> 59:57.620
 The second purpose of every successful intelligence operation

59:57.620 --> 1:00:01.620
 when they become public is to send a signal to the world.

1:00:01.620 --> 1:00:04.620
 If you work against us, we will do this to you.

1:00:04.620 --> 1:00:08.620
 If you work for us, we will take care of you in this way.

1:00:08.620 --> 1:00:10.620
 It's a massive information campaign.

1:00:10.620 --> 1:00:14.620
 Do you think in that way CIA is not doing a good job?

1:00:14.620 --> 1:00:20.620
 Because there's the FSB, perhaps much less so JRU,

1:00:20.620 --> 1:00:26.620
 but the KGB did this well, which is to send a signal,

1:00:26.620 --> 1:00:31.620
 basically communicate that this is a terrifying organization

1:00:31.620 --> 1:00:33.620
 with a lot of power.

1:00:33.620 --> 1:00:35.620
 So Mossad is doing a good job of that.

1:00:35.620 --> 1:00:36.620
 Correct.

1:00:36.620 --> 1:00:39.620
 The psychological information warfare.

1:00:39.620 --> 1:00:47.620
 And it seems like the CIA also has a lot of myths about it,

1:00:47.620 --> 1:00:49.620
 conspiracy theories about it,

1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:51.620
 but much less so than the other agencies.

1:00:51.620 --> 1:00:54.620
 CIA does a good job of playing to the mythos.

1:00:54.620 --> 1:00:58.620
 So when General Petraeus used to be the director of CIA,

1:00:58.620 --> 1:00:59.620
 2000.

1:00:59.620 --> 1:01:00.620
 And your workout partner.

1:01:00.620 --> 1:01:01.620
 And my workout partner.

1:01:01.620 --> 1:01:02.620
 I write about this.

1:01:02.620 --> 1:01:04.620
 So I loved and hated those workouts with Petraeus

1:01:04.620 --> 1:01:07.620
 because he is a physical beast.

1:01:07.620 --> 1:01:11.620
 He's a strong fit at the time, 60 something year old man.

1:01:11.620 --> 1:01:13.620
 Let me take a tangent on that because he's coming on this podcast.

1:01:13.620 --> 1:01:14.620
 Oh, excellent man.

1:01:14.620 --> 1:01:21.620
 So can you say what you've learned from the man in terms of,

1:01:21.620 --> 1:01:25.620
 or like what you think is interesting and powerful

1:01:25.620 --> 1:01:27.620
 and inspiring about the way he sees the world

1:01:27.620 --> 1:01:31.620
 or maybe what you learned in terms of how to get strong in the gym

1:01:31.620 --> 1:01:33.620
 or anything about life.

1:01:33.620 --> 1:01:34.620
 Two things right away.

1:01:34.620 --> 1:01:36.620
 And one of them I was going to share with you anyway.

1:01:36.620 --> 1:01:37.620
 She asked the question.

1:01:37.620 --> 1:01:42.620
 So the first is that on our runs and man,

1:01:42.620 --> 1:01:45.620
 he runs fast and we would go for six mile runs through Bangkok.

1:01:45.620 --> 1:01:50.620
 And he talked openly about, I asked him,

1:01:50.620 --> 1:01:57.620
 how do you keep this mystery, this epic mythology

1:01:57.620 --> 1:02:00.620
 about your fitness and your strength?

1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:04.620
 How do you keep all of this alive with the troops?

1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:06.620
 And he had this amazing answer and he was like,

1:02:06.620 --> 1:02:08.620
 I don't talk about it.

1:02:08.620 --> 1:02:12.620
 Myths are born not from somebody orchestrating the myth,

1:02:12.620 --> 1:02:16.620
 but from the source of the myth simply being secretive.

1:02:16.620 --> 1:02:18.620
 So he's like, I don't talk about it.

1:02:18.620 --> 1:02:19.620
 I've never talked about it.

1:02:19.620 --> 1:02:20.620
 I've never exacerbated it.

1:02:20.620 --> 1:02:23.620
 I just do what I do and I let the troops talk.

1:02:23.620 --> 1:02:25.620
 And he's like, when it's in favor,

1:02:25.620 --> 1:02:29.620
 when it goes in favor of discipline and loyalty and commitment,

1:02:29.620 --> 1:02:30.620
 I let it run.

1:02:30.620 --> 1:02:33.620
 If it starts getting destructive or damaging,

1:02:33.620 --> 1:02:37.620
 then I have my leadership team step in to fix it.

1:02:37.620 --> 1:02:40.620
 But when it comes to the mythos,

1:02:40.620 --> 1:02:42.620
 the myth of him being superpowered soldier,

1:02:42.620 --> 1:02:44.620
 that's what he wants every soldier to be.

1:02:44.620 --> 1:02:45.620
 So he lets it run.

1:02:45.620 --> 1:02:48.620
 And it was so enlightening when he told me,

1:02:48.620 --> 1:02:51.620
 when there's a myth that benefits you, you just let it go.

1:02:51.620 --> 1:02:54.620
 You let it happen because it gets you further

1:02:54.620 --> 1:02:55.620
 without you doing any work.

1:02:55.620 --> 1:02:56.620
 It costs no investment for you.

1:02:56.620 --> 1:02:58.620
 So the catalyst of the virality of the myth

1:02:58.620 --> 1:03:00.620
 is just being mysterious.

1:03:00.620 --> 1:03:02.620
 And that's what CIA does well to go back to your first question.

1:03:02.620 --> 1:03:03.620
 What does CIA do?

1:03:03.620 --> 1:03:05.620
 They don't answer any questions.

1:03:05.620 --> 1:03:07.620
 They don't say anything.

1:03:07.620 --> 1:03:09.620
 And wherever the myth goes, the myth goes,

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:13.620
 whether it's that they sold drugs or used child prostitutes

1:03:13.620 --> 1:03:16.620
 or whatever else, wherever the myth goes, they let it go.

1:03:16.620 --> 1:03:19.620
 Because at the end of the day, everybody sits back and says,

1:03:19.620 --> 1:03:21.620
 wow, I really just don't know.

1:03:21.620 --> 1:03:23.620
 Now, the second thing that I learned from Petraeus,

1:03:23.620 --> 1:03:26.620
 and I really am a big fan of Petraeus,

1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:28.620
 I know he made personal mistakes.

1:03:28.620 --> 1:03:31.620
 You don't get to be that powerful without making personal mistakes.

1:03:31.620 --> 1:03:35.620
 But when I worked out with him, the one thing that my,

1:03:35.620 --> 1:03:39.620
 the one thing that my commanding officer told me not to ask about,

1:03:39.620 --> 1:03:43.620
 he was like, never ask the general about his family.

1:03:43.620 --> 1:03:44.620
 I'm a family guy.

1:03:44.620 --> 1:03:47.620
 So as soon as I met General Petraeus,

1:03:47.620 --> 1:03:49.620
 one of the first things I asked him was,

1:03:49.620 --> 1:03:51.620
 hey, what was it like raising a family

1:03:51.620 --> 1:03:54.620
 and being the commander of forces in the Middle East?

1:03:54.620 --> 1:03:56.620
 Like you weren't with your family very much.

1:03:56.620 --> 1:03:58.620
 And the thing I love about the guy,

1:03:58.620 --> 1:04:00.620
 he didn't bite off my head.

1:04:00.620 --> 1:04:01.620
 He didn't snap at me.

1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:02.620
 He didn't do anything.

1:04:02.620 --> 1:04:04.620
 He openly admitted that he regretted

1:04:04.620 --> 1:04:06.620
 some of the decisions that he made

1:04:06.620 --> 1:04:10.620
 because he had to sacrifice his family to get there.

1:04:10.620 --> 1:04:14.620
 Relationships with his children, absentee father,

1:04:14.620 --> 1:04:17.620
 missing birthdays, missing, we all say,

1:04:17.620 --> 1:04:19.620
 we all say how sad it is to miss birthdays

1:04:19.620 --> 1:04:21.620
 and miss anniversaries, yada, yada, yada.

1:04:21.620 --> 1:04:22.620
 Everybody knows what that feels like.

1:04:22.620 --> 1:04:23.620
 Even business people know what that feels like.

1:04:23.620 --> 1:04:25.620
 The actual pain that we're talking about

1:04:25.620 --> 1:04:29.620
 is when you're not there to handle your 13 year old's questions

1:04:29.620 --> 1:04:31.620
 when a boy breaks up with her.

1:04:31.620 --> 1:04:34.620
 Or when you're not there to handle the bloody lip

1:04:34.620 --> 1:04:35.620
 that your nine year old comes back with

1:04:35.620 --> 1:04:37.620
 from their first encounter with a bully.

1:04:37.620 --> 1:04:39.620
 Those are the truly heartbreaking moments

1:04:39.620 --> 1:04:41.620
 that a parent lives and dies by.

1:04:41.620 --> 1:04:45.620
 He missed almost all of those

1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:47.620
 because he was fighting a war that we forgot

1:04:47.620 --> 1:04:50.620
 and we gave up on 20 years later, right?

1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:53.620
 He's so honest about that.

1:04:53.620 --> 1:04:56.620
 And it was really inspiring to me

1:04:56.620 --> 1:04:58.620
 to be told not to ask that question.

1:04:58.620 --> 1:05:02.620
 And when I broke that guidance, he didn't reprimand me.

1:05:02.620 --> 1:05:04.620
 He just, he was authentic.

1:05:04.620 --> 1:05:06.620
 And it was absolutely one of the big decisions

1:05:06.620 --> 1:05:09.620
 that helped me leave CIA on my own in 2014.

1:05:09.620 --> 1:05:14.620
 And he was honest on the sacrifice you make.

1:05:14.620 --> 1:05:17.620
 The same man, the same man who just taught me a lesson

1:05:17.620 --> 1:05:20.620
 about letting a myth live.

1:05:20.620 --> 1:05:23.620
 That same guy was willing to be so authentic

1:05:23.620 --> 1:05:27.620
 about this personal mistake.

1:05:27.620 --> 1:05:30.620
 I like complicated people like that.

1:05:30.620 --> 1:05:34.620
 So what did you, what do you make of that calculation?

1:05:34.620 --> 1:05:36.620
 A family versus job.

1:05:36.620 --> 1:05:40.620
 You've given a lot of your life and passion

1:05:40.620 --> 1:05:43.620
 to the CIA, to that work.

1:05:43.620 --> 1:05:47.620
 You spoke positively about that world.

1:05:47.620 --> 1:05:50.620
 The good it does.

1:05:50.620 --> 1:05:53.620
 And yet you're also a family man and you value that.

1:05:53.620 --> 1:05:55.620
 What's that calculation like?

1:05:55.620 --> 1:05:56.620
 What's that trade off like?

1:05:56.620 --> 1:05:57.620
 The calculation is very clear.

1:05:57.620 --> 1:05:58.620
 It's family.

1:05:58.620 --> 1:06:02.620
 I left CIA because I chose my family.

1:06:02.620 --> 1:06:06.620
 And when my son was born, my wife and I found out

1:06:06.620 --> 1:06:08.620
 that we were pregnant while we were still on mission.

1:06:08.620 --> 1:06:09.620
 We were a tandem couple.

1:06:09.620 --> 1:06:11.620
 My wife is also a former CIA officer,

1:06:11.620 --> 1:06:12.620
 undercover like me.

1:06:12.620 --> 1:06:14.620
 We were operating together overseas.

1:06:14.620 --> 1:06:16.620
 We got the positive pregnancy tests,

1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:18.620
 like so many people do.

1:06:18.620 --> 1:06:21.620
 And she cried.

1:06:21.620 --> 1:06:23.620
 My wife was a badass.

1:06:23.620 --> 1:06:26.620
 I was just, I was like the accidental spy,

1:06:26.620 --> 1:06:28.620
 but my wife was really good at what she does.

1:06:28.620 --> 1:06:32.620
 And she cried and she was like, what do we do now?

1:06:32.620 --> 1:06:34.620
 It's what we've always wanted, a child,

1:06:34.620 --> 1:06:38.620
 but we're in this thing right now.

1:06:38.620 --> 1:06:41.620
 There's no space for a child.

1:06:41.620 --> 1:06:45.620
 So long story short, we had our baby.

1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:48.620
 CIA brought us back to have the baby.

1:06:48.620 --> 1:06:50.620
 And when we started having the conversations about,

1:06:50.620 --> 1:06:53.620
 okay, what do we do next?

1:06:53.620 --> 1:06:56.620
 Because we're not the type of people to want to just sit around

1:06:56.620 --> 1:06:58.620
 and be domestic.

1:06:58.620 --> 1:06:59.620
 What do we do next?

1:06:59.620 --> 1:07:01.620
 But keep in mind, we have a child now.

1:07:01.620 --> 1:07:03.620
 So here's some of our suggestions.

1:07:03.620 --> 1:07:05.620
 We could do this and we can do that.

1:07:05.620 --> 1:07:07.620
 Let us get our child to a place where we can put him

1:07:07.620 --> 1:07:09.620
 into an international school or we can get him

1:07:09.620 --> 1:07:12.620
 into some sort of program where we have,

1:07:12.620 --> 1:07:16.620
 we can both operate together again during the day.

1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:18.620
 But CIA just had no,

1:07:18.620 --> 1:07:20.620
 no patience for that conversation.

1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:23.620
 There was no family is not their priority.

1:07:23.620 --> 1:07:26.620
 So the fact that we were a tandem couple,

1:07:26.620 --> 1:07:28.620
 two officers, two operators trying to have a baby

1:07:28.620 --> 1:07:30.620
 was irrelevant to them.

1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:32.620
 So when they didn't play with us,

1:07:32.620 --> 1:07:38.620
 when they did nothing to help us prioritize parenthood

1:07:38.620 --> 1:07:41.620
 as part of our overall experience,

1:07:41.620 --> 1:07:43.620
 that's when we knew that they never would.

1:07:43.620 --> 1:07:46.620
 And what good is it to commit yourself to a career

1:07:46.620 --> 1:07:48.620
 if the career is always going to challenge the thing

1:07:48.620 --> 1:07:50.620
 that you value most?

1:07:50.620 --> 1:07:53.620
 And that was the calculation that we made to leave CIA.

1:07:53.620 --> 1:07:55.620
 Not everybody makes that calculation.

1:07:55.620 --> 1:08:00.620
 And a big part of why I am so vocal about my time at CIA

1:08:00.620 --> 1:08:04.620
 is because I am immensely appreciative of the men

1:08:04.620 --> 1:08:09.620
 and women who to this day have failed marriages

1:08:09.620 --> 1:08:11.620
 and poor relationships with their children

1:08:11.620 --> 1:08:14.620
 because they chose national security.

1:08:14.620 --> 1:08:17.620
 They chose protecting America over their own family.

1:08:17.620 --> 1:08:20.620
 And they've done it even though it's made them,

1:08:20.620 --> 1:08:23.620
 you know, abuse alcohol and abuse substances

1:08:23.620 --> 1:08:25.620
 and they've gotten themselves,

1:08:25.620 --> 1:08:28.620
 they've got permanent diseases and issues

1:08:28.620 --> 1:08:31.620
 from living and working abroad.

1:08:31.620 --> 1:08:35.620
 It's just insane the sacrifice that officers make

1:08:35.620 --> 1:08:37.620
 to keep America free.

1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:41.620
 And I'm just not one of those people I chose family.

1:08:41.620 --> 1:08:44.620
 You said that your wife misses it. Do you miss it?

1:08:44.620 --> 1:08:47.620
 We both miss it. We miss it for different reasons.

1:08:47.620 --> 1:08:49.620
 We miss it for similar reasons, I guess,

1:08:49.620 --> 1:08:51.620
 but we miss it in different ways.

1:08:51.620 --> 1:08:55.620
 The people at CIA are just amazing.

1:08:55.620 --> 1:08:58.620
 They're people that, they're everyday people

1:08:58.620 --> 1:09:00.620
 like the guy in the gown next door,

1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:04.620
 but so smart and so dedicated and so courageous

1:09:04.620 --> 1:09:06.620
 about what they do and how they do it.

1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:08.620
 I mean, the sacrifices they make are massive.

1:09:08.620 --> 1:09:10.620
 More massive than the sacrifices I made.

1:09:10.620 --> 1:09:12.620
 So I was always inspired and impressed

1:09:12.620 --> 1:09:13.620
 by the people around me.

1:09:13.620 --> 1:09:16.620
 So both my wife and I absolutely miss the people.

1:09:16.620 --> 1:09:19.620
 My wife misses the work because you know everything.

1:09:19.620 --> 1:09:23.620
 When you're inside, it's all, I mean, we had,

1:09:23.620 --> 1:09:26.620
 we had top secret, we had TSSCI clearances at the time.

1:09:26.620 --> 1:09:29.620
 I had a cat six, cat 12, which makes me nuclear cleared.

1:09:29.620 --> 1:09:32.620
 My wife had other privy clearances that allowed her

1:09:32.620 --> 1:09:36.620
 to look into, you know, areas that were specialized.

1:09:36.620 --> 1:09:40.620
 But there was not, there wasn't a headline that went out

1:09:40.620 --> 1:09:43.620
 that we couldn't fact check with a click of a few buttons.

1:09:43.620 --> 1:09:46.620
 And she misses that cause she loved that kind of film.

1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:49.620
 And now you're just one of us living in the, you know,

1:09:49.620 --> 1:09:51.620
 the cloud of mystery.

1:09:51.620 --> 1:09:52.620
 Exactly.

1:09:52.620 --> 1:09:54.620
 Not really knowing anything about what's going on.

1:09:54.620 --> 1:09:55.620
 Exactly.

1:09:55.620 --> 1:09:58.620
 But for me, I've always been the person that likes operating

1:09:58.620 --> 1:10:00.620
 and you know what you still get to do when you leave CIA?

1:10:00.620 --> 1:10:01.620
 You still get to operate.

1:10:01.620 --> 1:10:03.620
 Operating is just working with people.

1:10:03.620 --> 1:10:06.620
 It's understanding how people think, predicting their actions,

1:10:06.620 --> 1:10:09.620
 driving their, their direction of their thoughts, persuading them,

1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:11.620
 winning negotiations.

1:10:11.620 --> 1:10:13.620
 It's, you still get to do that.

1:10:13.620 --> 1:10:14.620
 You do that every day.

1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:17.620
 And you can apply that in all kinds of domains.

1:10:17.620 --> 1:10:23.620
 Well, let me ask you on that, you were a covert CIA intelligence

1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:25.620
 officer for several years.

1:10:25.620 --> 1:10:28.620
 Maybe can you tell me the story of how it all began?

1:10:28.620 --> 1:10:32.620
 How, where you recruited and what did the job entail to the

1:10:32.620 --> 1:10:33.620
 degree you can speak about it?

1:10:33.620 --> 1:10:36.620
 Feel free to direct me if I'm getting too boring or if the, if the

1:10:36.620 --> 1:10:40.620
 Every aspect of this is super expensive.

1:10:40.620 --> 1:10:46.620
 So, so I was leaving the United States Air Force in 2007.

1:10:46.620 --> 1:10:50.620
 I was a, I was a lieutenant getting ready to pin on captain.

1:10:50.620 --> 1:10:55.620
 My five years was up and I was a very bad fit for the U.S. Air Force.

1:10:55.620 --> 1:10:58.620
 I was an Air Force Academy graduate, not by choice,

1:10:58.620 --> 1:11:01.620
 but by lack of opportunity, lack of, lack of options otherwise.

1:11:01.620 --> 1:11:04.620
 So I forced myself through the Academy, barely graduated with a

1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:06.620
 2.4 GPA.

1:11:06.620 --> 1:11:09.620
 And then went on the Air Force taught me how to fly.

1:11:09.620 --> 1:11:11.620
 And then the Air Force taught me about nuclear weapons.

1:11:11.620 --> 1:11:17.620
 And I ended up as a, as a nuclear missile commander in Montana.

1:11:17.620 --> 1:11:22.620
 And I chose to leave the Air Force because I didn't like shaving

1:11:22.620 --> 1:11:23.620
 my face.

1:11:23.620 --> 1:11:25.620
 I didn't like having short hair and I most definitely didn't like

1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:26.620
 shining my shoes.

1:11:26.620 --> 1:11:28.620
 And I did not want to be one of the people in charge of nuclear

1:11:28.620 --> 1:11:29.620
 weapons.

1:11:29.620 --> 1:11:32.620
 So when I found myself as a person in charge of 200 nuclear weapons,

1:11:32.620 --> 1:11:34.620
 I knew that I was going down the wrong road.

1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:36.620
 I have questions about this.

1:11:36.620 --> 1:11:38.620
 And more importantly, I have questions about your hair.

1:11:38.620 --> 1:11:40.620
 So you have short hair at the time?

1:11:40.620 --> 1:11:42.620
 I have, yeah, you have to military regulations.

1:11:42.620 --> 1:11:44.620
 You can't have hair longer than one inch.

1:11:44.620 --> 1:11:45.620
 Okay.

1:11:45.620 --> 1:11:48.620
 And this, the, the beautiful hair you have now,

1:11:48.620 --> 1:11:52.620
 that came to be in the CIA or after this.

1:11:52.620 --> 1:11:56.620
 So I discovered I had messy hair in CIA because I used to,

1:11:56.620 --> 1:11:57.620
 I used to go moose.

1:11:57.620 --> 1:11:58.620
 We called it moose.

1:11:58.620 --> 1:12:02.620
 I used to go Mujahideen style big burly beard and crazy wacky hair.

1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:03.620
 Yeah.

1:12:03.620 --> 1:12:07.620
 Because an ambiguously brown guy with a big beard and long hair can go

1:12:07.620 --> 1:12:11.620
 anywhere in the world without anyone even noticing him.

1:12:11.620 --> 1:12:16.620
 They either think that he's a janitor or they think that he's like some

1:12:16.620 --> 1:12:20.620
 forgotten part of history, but nobody ever thinks that that guy is a

1:12:20.620 --> 1:12:21.620
 spy.

1:12:21.620 --> 1:12:23.620
 So it was the perfect for me.

1:12:23.620 --> 1:12:27.620
 It was one of my favorite disguises.

1:12:27.620 --> 1:12:29.620
 It's what's known as a level two disguise.

1:12:29.620 --> 1:12:35.620
 One of my favorite disguises to Don was just dilapidated brown guy.

1:12:35.620 --> 1:12:37.620
 Can you actually, would you take a million tangents?

1:12:37.620 --> 1:12:39.620
 What, what's a level two disguise?

1:12:39.620 --> 1:12:42.620
 What, what's a, what are the different levels of disguise?

1:12:42.620 --> 1:12:43.620
 What are the disguises?

1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:44.620
 Yeah.

1:12:44.620 --> 1:12:46.620
 There's three levels of disguise by and large.

1:12:46.620 --> 1:12:49.620
 Level one is what we also know, what we also call light disguise.

1:12:49.620 --> 1:12:53.620
 So that's essentially, you put on sunglasses and a ball cap and,

1:12:53.620 --> 1:12:54.620
 and that's a disguise.

1:12:54.620 --> 1:12:56.620
 You look different than you normally look.

1:12:56.620 --> 1:13:00.620
 So it's just different enough that someone who's never seen you before,

1:13:00.620 --> 1:13:04.620
 someone who literally has to see you just from a picture on the internet,

1:13:04.620 --> 1:13:05.620
 they may not recognize you.

1:13:05.620 --> 1:13:09.620
 It's why you see celebrities walk around with ball caps and oversized

1:13:09.620 --> 1:13:12.620
 jackets and baseball hats, cause they just need to not look like they look

1:13:12.620 --> 1:13:15.620
 in the tabloid or not look like they look in TV.

1:13:15.620 --> 1:13:16.620
 That's level one.

1:13:16.620 --> 1:13:19.620
 Let me jump from level one to level three.

1:13:19.620 --> 1:13:23.620
 Level three is all of your prosthetics, all the stuff you see in Mission

1:13:23.620 --> 1:13:24.620
 Impossible.

1:13:24.620 --> 1:13:29.620
 Your fake ears, your fake faces, your fat suits, your stilts inside your leg,

1:13:29.620 --> 1:13:31.620
 your feet, all that's level three.

1:13:31.620 --> 1:13:36.620
 Whenever they make any kind of prosthetic disguise, that's a level three

1:13:36.620 --> 1:13:42.620
 disguise because prosthetics are very damning if you are caught with a prosthetic.

1:13:42.620 --> 1:13:46.620
 If you're caught wearing a sudden, wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses,

1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:48.620
 nobody's going to say you're a spy.

1:13:48.620 --> 1:13:54.620
 But when you're caught with a custom made nose prosthetic that changes the way

1:13:54.620 --> 1:13:58.620
 your face looks or when someone pops out a fake jaw and they see that your top

1:13:58.620 --> 1:14:02.620
 teeth don't look like they did in this prosthetic, then all of a sudden,

1:14:02.620 --> 1:14:06.620
 you've got some very difficult questions to ask or to answer.

1:14:06.620 --> 1:14:08.620
 So level three is extremely dangerous.

1:14:08.620 --> 1:14:09.620
 Level one is not dangerous.

1:14:09.620 --> 1:14:11.620
 Level two is long term disguise.

1:14:11.620 --> 1:14:15.620
 Level two is all the things that you can do to permanently change the way you

1:14:15.620 --> 1:14:19.620
 look for a long period of time so that whether you're aggressed in the street

1:14:19.620 --> 1:14:24.620
 or whether someone breaks into your hotel room or whatever, it's real.

1:14:24.620 --> 1:14:26.620
 So maybe you get a tattoo.

1:14:26.620 --> 1:14:28.620
 Maybe you cut your hair short.

1:14:28.620 --> 1:14:29.620
 Maybe you grow your hair long.

1:14:29.620 --> 1:14:30.620
 Maybe you go bald.

1:14:30.620 --> 1:14:32.620
 Maybe you start wearing glasses.

1:14:32.620 --> 1:14:37.620
 Glasses are technically a prosthetic, but if you have teeth pulled,

1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:43.620
 if you gain 20 pounds, really gain 20 pounds or lose 15 pounds, whatever you might do,

1:14:43.620 --> 1:14:45.620
 all of that's considered level two.

1:14:45.620 --> 1:14:51.620
 It's designed for a long term mission so that people believe you are who you say

1:14:51.620 --> 1:14:52.620
 you are in that disguise.

1:14:52.620 --> 1:14:55.620
 A lot of that is physical characteristics.

1:14:55.620 --> 1:15:04.620
 What about what actors do, which is the method acting sort of developing a back

1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:12.620
 story in your own mind and then you start pretending that you host the podcast

1:15:12.620 --> 1:15:17.620
 and teach at a university and then do research and so on

1:15:17.620 --> 1:15:21.620
 just so that people can believe that you're not actually an agent.

1:15:21.620 --> 1:15:24.620
 Is that part of the disguise levels or no?

1:15:24.620 --> 1:15:27.620
 So yes, disguise has to do with physical character traits.

1:15:27.620 --> 1:15:28.620
 That's what a disguise is.

1:15:28.620 --> 1:15:31.620
 What you're talking about is known as a cover legend.

1:15:31.620 --> 1:15:35.620
 When you go undercover, what you claim to be, who you claim to be,

1:15:35.620 --> 1:15:37.620
 that's called your legend, your cover legend.

1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:41.620
 Every disguise would theoretically have its own cover legend.

1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:44.620
 Even if it's just to describe why you're wearing what you're wearing,

1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:46.620
 it's all a cover.

1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:51.620
 So the method acting, this is a fantastic point that I don't get to make very often,

1:15:51.620 --> 1:15:52.620
 so I'm glad you asked.

1:15:52.620 --> 1:15:56.620
 The difference between CIA officers in the field and method actors is that method

1:15:56.620 --> 1:15:59.620
 actors try to become the character.

1:15:59.620 --> 1:16:05.620
 They try to shed all vestiges of who they really are and become the character.

1:16:05.620 --> 1:16:07.620
 And that's part of what makes them so amazing,

1:16:07.620 --> 1:16:12.620
 but it's also part of what makes them mentally unstable over long periods of time.

1:16:12.620 --> 1:16:16.620
 It's part of what feeds their depression, their anxiety, their personal issues,

1:16:16.620 --> 1:16:18.620
 because they lose sight of who they really are.

1:16:18.620 --> 1:16:20.620
 Field officers don't get that luxury.

1:16:20.620 --> 1:16:26.620
 We have to always, always remember we are a covert CIA intelligence officer

1:16:26.620 --> 1:16:28.620
 collecting secrets in the field.

1:16:28.620 --> 1:16:29.620
 We have to remember that.

1:16:29.620 --> 1:16:36.620
 So we're taught a very specific skill to compartmentalize our true self

1:16:36.620 --> 1:16:42.620
 separately, but make that true self the true identity.

1:16:42.620 --> 1:16:47.620
 So then we can still live and act and effectively carry out our cover legend

1:16:47.620 --> 1:16:53.620
 without ever losing sight, without ever losing that compass true north of who we actually are.

1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:56.620
 And then we can compartmentalize and secure all the information that we need,

1:16:56.620 --> 1:17:02.620
 retain it, remember it, but then return to our true self when we get back to a position of safety.

1:17:02.620 --> 1:17:04.620
 Is it possible to do that?

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:08.620
 I just have kind of anecdotal evidence for myself.

1:17:08.620 --> 1:17:14.620
 I really try to be the exact same person in all conditions, which makes it very easy.

1:17:14.620 --> 1:17:20.620
 Like if you're not lying, it makes it very easy to, first of all, to exist,

1:17:20.620 --> 1:17:24.620
 but also to communicate a kind of authenticity and a genuineness,

1:17:24.620 --> 1:17:26.620
 which I think is really important.

1:17:26.620 --> 1:17:30.620
 Like trust and integrity around trust is extremely important to me.

1:17:30.620 --> 1:17:34.620
 It's the thing that opens doors and maintains relationships.

1:17:34.620 --> 1:17:39.620
 And I tend to think like when I was in Ukraine,

1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:46.620
 so many doors just opened to the very high security areas and everywhere else too.

1:17:46.620 --> 1:17:51.620
 Like I've just interacted with some incredible people without any kind of concerns.

1:17:51.620 --> 1:17:53.620
 You know, who's this guy?

1:17:53.620 --> 1:17:54.620
 Is he going to spread it?

1:17:54.620 --> 1:17:55.620
 You know, all that kind of stuff.

1:17:55.620 --> 1:18:00.620
 I tend to believe that you're able to communicate a trustworthiness somehow

1:18:00.620 --> 1:18:04.620
 if you just are who you are.

1:18:04.620 --> 1:18:09.620
 And I think, I suppose, method actors are trying to achieve that by becoming something.

1:18:09.620 --> 1:18:17.620
 And I just feel like there is very subtle cues that are extremely difficult to fake.

1:18:17.620 --> 1:18:21.620
 Like you really have to become that person, be that person.

1:18:21.620 --> 1:18:28.620
 But you're saying as a CIA agent, you have to remember that you are there to collect information.

1:18:28.620 --> 1:18:30.620
 Do you think that gives you away?

1:18:30.620 --> 1:18:37.620
 So one of the flaws in your argument is that you keep referring to how you feel.

1:18:37.620 --> 1:18:38.620
 I feel this.

1:18:38.620 --> 1:18:39.620
 I feel that.

1:18:39.620 --> 1:18:40.620
 I feel like this.

1:18:40.620 --> 1:18:41.620
 I feel like that.

1:18:41.620 --> 1:18:46.620
 That feeling is a predictable character trait of all human beings.

1:18:46.620 --> 1:18:47.620
 It's a pink matter.

1:18:47.620 --> 1:18:48.620
 We call it pink matter.

1:18:48.620 --> 1:18:51.620
 It's a cognitive trait.

1:18:51.620 --> 1:18:54.620
 You are not alone in trusting your feelings.

1:18:54.620 --> 1:18:56.620
 All people trust their feelings.

1:18:56.620 --> 1:19:03.620
 But because what CIA teaches us is how to systematically create artificial relationships

1:19:03.620 --> 1:19:07.620
 where we're the one in control of the source that is giving us intelligence.

1:19:07.620 --> 1:19:16.620
 And the core element to being able to control a relationship is understanding the pink matter truth of feelings.

1:19:16.620 --> 1:19:20.620
 What all people feel becomes their point of view on what reality is.

1:19:20.620 --> 1:19:24.620
 So when you understand and you learn how to manipulate what people feel,

1:19:24.620 --> 1:19:27.620
 then you can essentially direct them to feel any way you want them to feel.

1:19:27.620 --> 1:19:31.620
 So if you want them to feel like they can trust you, you can make them feel that way.

1:19:31.620 --> 1:19:34.620
 If you want them to feel like you're a good guy or a bad guy,

1:19:34.620 --> 1:19:38.620
 if you want them to feel like they should give you secrets even though their government tells them not to,

1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:39.620
 you can do that.

1:19:39.620 --> 1:19:44.620
 There are men who make women feel like they love them and just so that the woman will sleep with them.

1:19:44.620 --> 1:19:48.620
 There are women who make men feel like they love them just so that the men will give them their money.

1:19:48.620 --> 1:19:53.620
 Manipulation is a core behavioral trait of all the human species

1:19:53.620 --> 1:19:57.620
 because we all understand to some level how powerful feelings are.

1:19:57.620 --> 1:20:00.620
 But feelings are not the same thing as logical rational thought.

1:20:00.620 --> 1:20:02.620
 They're two different sides of the brain.

1:20:02.620 --> 1:20:09.620
 What CIA teaches us how to do is systematically tap into the right side, emotional side of the brain,

1:20:09.620 --> 1:20:13.620
 so that we can quickly get past all of the stuff you were just saying.

1:20:13.620 --> 1:20:17.620
 All of the, well, don't you have to be convincing and don't you have to really know your story

1:20:17.620 --> 1:20:19.620
 and don't you have to be able to defend it?

1:20:19.620 --> 1:20:25.620
 Don't you have to have authenticity and don't you have to have genuine feelings?

1:20:25.620 --> 1:20:29.620
 Yes, all of those things are true if you're having a genuine relationship.

1:20:29.620 --> 1:20:32.620
 But in an artificial relationship, there's ways to bypass all of that

1:20:32.620 --> 1:20:34.620
 and get right to the heart of making someone feel comfortable and safe.

1:20:34.620 --> 1:20:43.620
 I guess the question I'm asking and the thing I was implying is that creating an artificial relationship

1:20:43.620 --> 1:20:51.620
 was an extremely difficult skill to accomplish the level, like, how good I am at being me

1:20:51.620 --> 1:20:55.620
 and creating a feeling in another person that I create.

1:20:55.620 --> 1:21:03.620
 For you to do that artificially, that's got to be, you got to be, my sense is you got to be really damn good at that kind of thing.

1:21:03.620 --> 1:21:10.620
 I would venture to say, I mean, I don't know how to measure how difficult the thing is,

1:21:10.620 --> 1:21:18.620
 but especially when you're communicating with people whose job depends on forming trusting relationships,

1:21:18.620 --> 1:21:27.620
 they're going to smell bullshit and to get past that bullshit detector is tough.

1:21:27.620 --> 1:21:28.620
 It's a tough skill.

1:21:28.620 --> 1:21:29.620
 Well, it's interesting.

1:21:29.620 --> 1:21:30.620
 So I would say that...

1:21:30.620 --> 1:21:32.620
 Or maybe I'm wrong actually on that.

1:21:32.620 --> 1:21:35.620
 I would say that once you understand the system, it's not that hard.

1:21:35.620 --> 1:21:36.620
 It makes a lot of sense.

1:21:36.620 --> 1:21:41.620
 But I would also say that to your exact point, you are right that people smell bullshit.

1:21:41.620 --> 1:21:43.620
 People smell bullshit.

1:21:43.620 --> 1:21:44.620
 But here's the thing.

1:21:44.620 --> 1:21:51.620
 If you come in smelling like goat shit, you still smell like shit, but you don't smell like bullshit.

1:21:51.620 --> 1:21:53.620
 So they don't count you out right away.

1:21:53.620 --> 1:21:58.620
 And if you come in smelling like rotten tomatoes, or if you come in smelling like lavender,

1:21:58.620 --> 1:22:01.620
 or if you come in smelling like vanilla, or if you come in without any smell at all,

1:22:01.620 --> 1:22:04.620
 all that matters is that you don't smell like bullshit.

1:22:04.620 --> 1:22:09.620
 Here's the thing that's one of the secret sauces of CIA.

1:22:09.620 --> 1:22:13.620
 When you look and act like a spy, people think you're a spy.

1:22:13.620 --> 1:22:18.620
 If you look and act in any other way, you know what they never ever think you are?

1:22:18.620 --> 1:22:19.620
 A spy.

1:22:19.620 --> 1:22:21.620
 They might think you're an idiot.

1:22:21.620 --> 1:22:22.620
 They might think you're a...

1:22:22.620 --> 1:22:24.620
 They might think you're a trailer trash.

1:22:24.620 --> 1:22:29.620
 They might think that you're a migrant worker, but they never think you're a spy.

1:22:29.620 --> 1:22:31.620
 And that's what's...

1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:35.620
 That lesson in everyday life is immensely powerful.

1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:39.620
 If you're trying to take your boss's job,

1:22:39.620 --> 1:22:42.620
 as long as you don't ever look like the employee who's trying to take the boss's job,

1:22:42.620 --> 1:22:46.620
 the boss is focused on all the employees who are trying to take his job.

1:22:46.620 --> 1:22:48.620
 Everybody's prioritizing whether they know it or not.

1:22:48.620 --> 1:22:51.620
 The goal is to just not be the one that they're targeting.

1:22:51.620 --> 1:22:53.620
 Target them without them knowing you're targeting them.

1:22:53.620 --> 1:22:55.620
 So people just...

1:22:55.620 --> 1:22:57.620
 When they meet you, they put you in a bin.

1:22:57.620 --> 1:23:02.620
 And if you want to avoid being put in a particular bin, just don't act like the person that will be.

1:23:02.620 --> 1:23:06.620
 Just show some kind of characteristics that bin you in some other way.

1:23:06.620 --> 1:23:07.620
 Exactly right.

1:23:07.620 --> 1:23:08.620
 You have to be in a bin.

1:23:08.620 --> 1:23:10.620
 Just choose the bin.

1:23:10.620 --> 1:23:11.620
 All right.

1:23:11.620 --> 1:23:14.620
 So you...

1:23:14.620 --> 1:23:18.620
 Knowing these methods, when you talk to people, especially in civilian life,

1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:21.620
 how do you know who's lying to you and not?

1:23:21.620 --> 1:23:25.620
 That gets to be more into the trained skill side of things.

1:23:25.620 --> 1:23:27.620
 There's body cues.

1:23:27.620 --> 1:23:29.620
 There's micro expressions.

1:23:29.620 --> 1:23:30.620
 I'm not a big fan of...

1:23:30.620 --> 1:23:33.620
 I don't believe that micro expressions alone do anything.

1:23:33.620 --> 1:23:37.620
 I also don't believe that micro expressions without an effective baseline do anything.

1:23:37.620 --> 1:23:39.620
 So don't for a second think that I'm...

1:23:39.620 --> 1:23:43.620
 All the people out there pitching that you can tell if someone's lying to you just by looking at their face,

1:23:43.620 --> 1:23:45.620
 it's all baloney.

1:23:45.620 --> 1:23:47.620
 In my world, that's baloney.

1:23:47.620 --> 1:23:49.620
 Like the way you move your eyes or something like that?

1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:50.620
 Without knowing a baseline.

1:23:50.620 --> 1:23:51.620
 Without knowing...

1:23:51.620 --> 1:23:52.620
 For that individual?

1:23:52.620 --> 1:23:53.620
 For that individual.

1:23:53.620 --> 1:23:54.620
 Then you actually don't know.

1:23:54.620 --> 1:23:58.620
 The individual's baseline is based on education, culture, life experience, you name it.

1:23:58.620 --> 1:24:00.620
 So it's huge.

1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:06.620
 But when you combine facial expressions with body movements, body language, nonverbal cues,

1:24:06.620 --> 1:24:11.620
 and you add on top of that effective elicitation techniques that you are in control of,

1:24:11.620 --> 1:24:16.620
 now you have a more robust platform to tell if someone's lying to you.

1:24:16.620 --> 1:24:23.620
 So there's a set of interrogation, trajectories you can go down

1:24:23.620 --> 1:24:25.620
 that can help you figure out a person.

1:24:25.620 --> 1:24:27.620
 Technically, they're interview.

1:24:27.620 --> 1:24:28.620
 Interview.

1:24:28.620 --> 1:24:29.620
 Like this puppy.

1:24:29.620 --> 1:24:30.620
 Concepts.

1:24:30.620 --> 1:24:31.620
 Correct.

1:24:31.620 --> 1:24:34.620
 Because an interrogation, an interrogation is something very different than an interview.

1:24:34.620 --> 1:24:37.620
 In the world of professionals, an interrogation is very different.

1:24:37.620 --> 1:24:38.620
 What's the difference?

1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:40.620
 The nature of how relaxed the thing is or what?

1:24:40.620 --> 1:24:43.620
 So in an interrogation, there's a clear pattern of dominance.

1:24:43.620 --> 1:24:44.620
 There's no equality.

1:24:44.620 --> 1:24:45.620
 Got it.

1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:46.620
 Also, there's no escape.

1:24:46.620 --> 1:24:49.620
 You are there until the interrogator is done with you, right?

1:24:49.620 --> 1:24:52.620
 Anybody who's ever been reprimanded by mom and dad knows what an interrogation feels like.

1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:55.620
 Anybody who's ever been called into the principal's office or the boss's office,

1:24:55.620 --> 1:24:57.620
 that's what interrogation feels like.

1:24:57.620 --> 1:24:59.620
 You don't leave until the boss says you can leave.

1:24:59.620 --> 1:25:02.620
 And you're there to say, to answer questions, the boss asks questions.

1:25:02.620 --> 1:25:05.620
 An interview is an equal exchange of ideas.

1:25:05.620 --> 1:25:09.620
 You are in control of this interview, for sure.

1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:13.620
 But if we were having coffee, I could take control if I wanted to take control.

1:25:13.620 --> 1:25:15.620
 If I wanted to ask you personal questions, I would.

1:25:15.620 --> 1:25:17.620
 If I wanted to talk to you about your background, I could.

1:25:17.620 --> 1:25:19.620
 Why am I in control of this interview exactly?

1:25:19.620 --> 1:25:22.620
 Because the person in control is the person asking questions.

1:25:22.620 --> 1:25:30.620
 I'm sitting here, as you've spoken about, my power here is I'm the quiet one listening.

1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:31.620
 You're exactly right.

1:25:31.620 --> 1:25:33.620
 Guess where this conversation goes?

1:25:33.620 --> 1:25:36.620
 Anywhere you choose to take it, because you're the one asking questions.

1:25:36.620 --> 1:25:41.620
 Every time I answer a question, I am creating a pattern of obedience to you,

1:25:41.620 --> 1:25:45.620
 which subliminally, subconsciously, makes me that much more apt to answer your questions.

1:25:45.620 --> 1:25:49.620
 Of course, you can always turn that and start asking me questions.

1:25:49.620 --> 1:25:55.620
 But you're saying that through conversation, you can call it interviewing,

1:25:55.620 --> 1:26:05.620
 you can start to see cracks in the story of the person

1:26:05.620 --> 1:26:08.620
 and the degree to which they exaggerate or lie

1:26:08.620 --> 1:26:12.620
 or to see how much they could be trusted, that kind of stuff.

1:26:12.620 --> 1:26:16.620
 What I'm saying is that through a conversation, you develop a baseline.

1:26:16.620 --> 1:26:19.620
 Even just in the first part of our conversation,

1:26:19.620 --> 1:26:22.620
 I've been able to create some baseline elements about you.

1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:25.620
 You've been able to create baseline elements about me.

1:26:25.620 --> 1:26:27.620
 Maybe they're just not in front of mind.

1:26:27.620 --> 1:26:36.620
 From those baselines, now we can push through more intentional questions to test whether or not the person is being truthful

1:26:36.620 --> 1:26:38.620
 because they're operating within their baseline.

1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:42.620
 Or if you are triggering sensitivities outside of their baseline,

1:26:42.620 --> 1:26:44.620
 and then you can start to see their tells.

1:26:44.620 --> 1:26:45.620
 That's fascinating.

1:26:45.620 --> 1:26:49.620
 Yeah, even the tells, the eye contact.

1:26:49.620 --> 1:26:54.620
 You've probably already formed a baseline that I have trouble making eye contact.

1:26:54.620 --> 1:26:57.620
 If you ask me difficult questions and I'm not making eye contact,

1:26:57.620 --> 1:27:00.620
 maybe that's not a good signal of me lying or whatever.

1:27:00.620 --> 1:27:01.620
 Correct.

1:27:01.620 --> 1:27:03.620
 Because I always have trouble making eye contact.

1:27:03.620 --> 1:27:04.620
 Stuff like that.

1:27:04.620 --> 1:27:05.620
 That's really fascinating.

1:27:05.620 --> 1:27:07.620
 The majority of your eye movement is to the right.

1:27:07.620 --> 1:27:09.620
 Your right, my left.

1:27:09.620 --> 1:27:12.620
 Which is usually someone who's, if you ask micro expressionists,

1:27:12.620 --> 1:27:15.620
 that's someone who's referencing fact.

1:27:15.620 --> 1:27:19.620
 That's not necessarily what's happening for you because you're pulling concepts out of the air.

1:27:19.620 --> 1:27:21.620
 So it's also a place where you reference something other than fact.

1:27:21.620 --> 1:27:23.620
 It's a place for you to find creativity.

1:27:23.620 --> 1:27:26.620
 So if I just thought that you were lying because you look up into the right,

1:27:26.620 --> 1:27:27.620
 I would be wrong.

1:27:27.620 --> 1:27:28.620
 That's so fascinating.

1:27:28.620 --> 1:27:32.620
 And a lot of that has to do with like habits that are formed and all those kinds of things.

1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:35.620
 Or maybe some right hand, left hand type of situation.

1:27:35.620 --> 1:27:36.620
 Right eye dominance.

1:27:36.620 --> 1:27:38.620
 It's going to make you look to the right.

1:27:38.620 --> 1:27:40.620
 Is this a science or an art?

1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:41.620
 It's a bit of both.

1:27:41.620 --> 1:27:46.620
 I would say that like all good art, art is taught from a foundation of skills.

1:27:46.620 --> 1:27:53.620
 And those skills are played, are taught in a very structured manner.

1:27:53.620 --> 1:27:56.620
 And then the way that you use the skills after that,

1:27:56.620 --> 1:27:58.620
 that's more of the artistic grace.

1:27:58.620 --> 1:28:01.620
 So I've always called espionage an art.

1:28:01.620 --> 1:28:02.620
 Spying is an art.

1:28:02.620 --> 1:28:05.620
 Being able to hack human beings is an art.

1:28:05.620 --> 1:28:07.620
 But it's all based in a foundation of science.

1:28:07.620 --> 1:28:11.620
 You still have to learn how to mix the color palette and use certain brushes.

1:28:11.620 --> 1:28:16.620
 Do you think of that as a kind of the study of human psychology?

1:28:16.620 --> 1:28:19.620
 Is that what a psychologist does for psychiatrists?

1:28:19.620 --> 1:28:24.620
 What from this process have you learned about human nature?

1:28:24.620 --> 1:28:25.620
 Human nature.

1:28:25.620 --> 1:28:29.620
 I mean, I suppose the answer to that could be a book.

1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:31.620
 And probably will be a book.

1:28:31.620 --> 1:28:32.620
 I'll save you that.

1:28:32.620 --> 1:28:38.620
 But is there things that are surprising about human nature,

1:28:38.620 --> 1:28:42.620
 surprising to us civilians that you could speak to?

1:28:42.620 --> 1:28:43.620
 Yes.

1:28:43.620 --> 1:28:46.620
 One thing is extremely surprising about human nature,

1:28:46.620 --> 1:28:49.620
 which is funny because that's not the answer I would have said.

1:28:49.620 --> 1:28:52.620
 So I'm glad that you clarified this specific question.

1:28:52.620 --> 1:28:59.620
 The thing that's surprising about human nature is that human beings long,

1:28:59.620 --> 1:29:07.620
 like in their soul, there's like a painful longing to be with other people.

1:29:07.620 --> 1:29:11.620
 And that's really surprising because we all want to pretend like we're strong.

1:29:11.620 --> 1:29:13.620
 We all want to pretend like we're independent.

1:29:13.620 --> 1:29:18.620
 We all want to pretend like we are the masters of our destiny.

1:29:18.620 --> 1:29:28.620
 But what's truly consistent in all people is this longing to commune with others like us.

1:29:28.620 --> 1:29:34.620
 My more practical answer about what I've learned to be the truth is that people,

1:29:34.620 --> 1:29:36.620
 human nature is predictable.

1:29:36.620 --> 1:29:41.620
 And that predictability is what gives people an incredible advantage over other people.

1:29:41.620 --> 1:29:43.620
 But that's not the surprising piece.

1:29:43.620 --> 1:29:46.620
 I mean, even when CIA taught me that human nature is predictable,

1:29:46.620 --> 1:29:47.620
 it just made sense.

1:29:47.620 --> 1:29:48.620
 I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense.

1:29:48.620 --> 1:29:53.620
 But what I never, ever anticipated was no matter where I've been in the world,

1:29:53.620 --> 1:29:56.620
 no matter who I've talked to, no matter what,

1:29:56.620 --> 1:30:00.620
 the socioeconomic bracket is that longing, man, it hurts.

1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:02.620
 Loneliness sucks.

1:30:02.620 --> 1:30:04.620
 And togetherness feels good.

1:30:04.620 --> 1:30:06.620
 Even if you're together with someone you know isn't the right person,

1:30:06.620 --> 1:30:08.620
 it still feels better than being alone.

1:30:08.620 --> 1:30:11.620
 I mean, that's such a deep truth you speak to.

1:30:11.620 --> 1:30:14.620
 And I could talk about that for a long time.

1:30:14.620 --> 1:30:18.620
 There is, I mean, through these conversations in general,

1:30:18.620 --> 1:30:21.620
 whether it's being recorded or not,

1:30:21.620 --> 1:30:26.620
 I hunger to discover in the other person that longing.

1:30:26.620 --> 1:30:28.620
 You strip away the other things.

1:30:28.620 --> 1:30:31.620
 And then you share in the longing for that connection.

1:30:31.620 --> 1:30:39.620
 And I particularly also detected that in people from all walks of life,

1:30:39.620 --> 1:30:50.620
 including people that others might identify as evil or hard, as completely cold.

1:30:50.620 --> 1:30:52.620
 It's there.

1:30:52.620 --> 1:30:53.620
 It's there.

1:30:53.620 --> 1:30:56.620
 They've hardened themselves in their search.

1:30:56.620 --> 1:31:00.620
 And who knows what dark place their brain is in, their heart is in.

1:31:00.620 --> 1:31:03.620
 But that longing is still there.

1:31:03.620 --> 1:31:05.620
 Even if it's an ember, it's there.

1:31:05.620 --> 1:31:10.620
 It's the reason why in World War I and World War II,

1:31:10.620 --> 1:31:14.620
 you know, enemy combatants still shared cigarettes on the front lines,

1:31:14.620 --> 1:31:18.620
 you know, during periods of holidays or bad weather or whatever else,

1:31:18.620 --> 1:31:22.620
 because that human connection, man, it triumphs overall.

1:31:22.620 --> 1:31:27.620
 See, that's in part of what I refer to when I say love.

1:31:27.620 --> 1:31:33.620
 Because I feel like if political leaders and people in conflict

1:31:33.620 --> 1:31:41.620
 at the small scale and the large scale were able to tune into that longing,

1:31:41.620 --> 1:31:46.620
 to seek in each other that basic longing for human connection,

1:31:46.620 --> 1:31:49.620
 a lot of problems could be solved.

1:31:49.620 --> 1:31:56.620
 But of course, it's difficult because it's a game of chicken.

1:31:56.620 --> 1:32:02.620
 If you open yourself up to reveal that longing for connection with others,

1:32:02.620 --> 1:32:03.620
 people can hurt you.

1:32:03.620 --> 1:32:08.620
 Well, I would go a step farther and I would say that taking the connection away,

1:32:08.620 --> 1:32:16.620
 punishing, penalizing people by removing the connection is a powerful tool.

1:32:16.620 --> 1:32:17.620
 And that's what we see.

1:32:17.620 --> 1:32:19.620
 That's why we send people to jail.

1:32:19.620 --> 1:32:21.620
 That's why we put economic sanctions on countries.

1:32:21.620 --> 1:32:25.620
 That's why we ground our children and send them to their rooms.

1:32:25.620 --> 1:32:28.620
 We are penalizing them, whether we know it or not.

1:32:28.620 --> 1:32:33.620
 We're using punitive damage by taking away that basic human connection,

1:32:33.620 --> 1:32:35.620
 that longing for community.

1:32:35.620 --> 1:32:39.620
 What was your recruitment process and training process

1:32:39.620 --> 1:32:45.620
 and things you could speak to in the CIA?

1:32:45.620 --> 1:32:49.620
 As I was leaving the Air Force, all that was on my mind,

1:32:49.620 --> 1:32:54.620
 I don't know what you were like at 27, but I was a total dipshit at 27.

1:32:54.620 --> 1:32:56.620
 I'm not much better now at 42, but...

1:32:56.620 --> 1:32:59.620
 You and me both.

1:32:59.620 --> 1:33:00.620
 But I would...

1:33:00.620 --> 1:33:01.620
 Until you make it.

1:33:01.620 --> 1:33:06.620
 Yeah, but I was like, I just wanted to be anything other than a military officer.

1:33:06.620 --> 1:33:10.620
 So I was actually in the process of applying to the Peace Corps

1:33:10.620 --> 1:33:15.620
 through this thing called the internet, which was still fairly rudimentary in 2007.

1:33:15.620 --> 1:33:19.620
 I had a computer lab that we went to and it had 10 computers in it.

1:33:19.620 --> 1:33:22.620
 You had to log in and log out and slow internet and everything else.

1:33:22.620 --> 1:33:27.620
 But anyways, I was filling out an online application to go work in the US Peace Corps.

1:33:27.620 --> 1:33:29.620
 I wanted to grow my hair out.

1:33:29.620 --> 1:33:32.620
 I wanted to stop wearing shoes that were shiny.

1:33:32.620 --> 1:33:39.620
 I wanted to meet a hippie chick and have hippie babies in the wild teaching Nigerian children how to read.

1:33:39.620 --> 1:33:41.620
 So that was the path I was going down.

1:33:41.620 --> 1:33:46.620
 And as I filled in all of my details, there came this page that popped up

1:33:46.620 --> 1:33:48.620
 and it was this blinking red page and it said,

1:33:48.620 --> 1:33:49.620
 Stop here.

1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:52.620
 You may qualify for other government positions.

1:33:52.620 --> 1:33:56.620
 If you're willing to put your application on hold for 72 hours,

1:33:56.620 --> 1:33:59.620
 that gives us a chance to reach out to you.

1:33:59.620 --> 1:34:01.620
 So again, 27 year old dipshit.

1:34:01.620 --> 1:34:06.620
 I was like, sure, I'll put myself on hold if I might qualify for other government opportunities.

1:34:06.620 --> 1:34:11.620
 And then about a day later, I got a phone call from an almost unlisted number.

1:34:11.620 --> 1:34:15.620
 It just said 703, which was very strange to see on my flip phone at the time.

1:34:15.620 --> 1:34:17.620
 Just one 703 area code.

1:34:17.620 --> 1:34:24.620
 And I picked it up and it was a person from Northern Virginia

1:34:24.620 --> 1:34:29.620
 asking me if I would be telling me that I was qualified for a position in national security.

1:34:29.620 --> 1:34:34.620
 And if I would be interested, they'll pay for my ticket and fly me up to Langley, Virginia.

1:34:34.620 --> 1:34:36.620
 They didn't say CIA.

1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:37.620
 They said Langley.

1:34:37.620 --> 1:34:42.620
 I put one on one together and I was like, maybe this is how cool is this?

1:34:42.620 --> 1:34:45.620
 Or maybe this is all make believe and this is totally fake.

1:34:45.620 --> 1:34:47.620
 So either way, it doesn't hurt me at all to say yes.

1:34:47.620 --> 1:34:48.620
 They already have my phone number.

1:34:48.620 --> 1:34:50.620
 So yes, yes, yes.

1:34:50.620 --> 1:34:54.620
 And then I remember thinking there's no way that happened and this isn't real.

1:34:54.620 --> 1:35:02.620
 And then a day later, I got a FedEx or an overnight delivery of an airplane ticket and a hotel reservation and a rental car reservation.

1:35:02.620 --> 1:35:07.620
 And then I just kept doing the next thing, which I found out later on is a form of control.

1:35:07.620 --> 1:35:10.620
 You just do the next thing that they tell you to do.

1:35:10.620 --> 1:35:19.620
 And then before I knew it, I was interviewing in a nondescript building with a person who only told me their first name for a position with the national clandestine service.

1:35:19.620 --> 1:35:26.620
 You never really got a chance to think about it because there's a small steps along the way and it kind of just leads you.

1:35:26.620 --> 1:35:29.620
 And maybe your personality is such that...

1:35:29.620 --> 1:35:30.620
 That's an adventure.

1:35:30.620 --> 1:35:36.620
 It's an adventure and because it's one step at a time, you don't necessarily see the negative consequences of the adventure.

1:35:36.620 --> 1:35:38.620
 You don't think about any of that.

1:35:38.620 --> 1:35:41.620
 You're just stepping into the adventure.

1:35:41.620 --> 1:35:42.620
 And it's easy.

1:35:42.620 --> 1:35:43.620
 There's no work involved.

1:35:43.620 --> 1:35:46.620
 Somebody else is doing all the work, telling me where to be and when.

1:35:46.620 --> 1:35:48.620
 It's a lot like basic training in the military.

1:35:48.620 --> 1:35:51.620
 Whoever's ever been through basic training will tell you they hated the first few days.

1:35:51.620 --> 1:35:55.620
 And then by the end, it was really comforting because you just did what you were told.

1:35:55.620 --> 1:35:58.620
 They told you when to eat, they made the decision of what to eat.

1:35:58.620 --> 1:35:59.620
 And then you just...

1:35:59.620 --> 1:36:02.620
 You marched when they told you to march, shine your shoes when they told you to shine your shoes.

1:36:02.620 --> 1:36:05.620
 Human beings love being told what to do.

1:36:05.620 --> 1:36:14.620
 What about the training process for becoming a covert CIA agent?

1:36:14.620 --> 1:36:18.620
 Yeah, so the interview process is...

1:36:18.620 --> 1:36:20.620
 Yeah, the interview process too.

1:36:20.620 --> 1:36:22.620
 How rigorous was that?

1:36:22.620 --> 1:36:23.620
 It was very rigorous.

1:36:23.620 --> 1:36:25.620
 That was where it became difficult.

1:36:25.620 --> 1:36:29.620
 Everything up to the first interview was easy, but there's three interviews.

1:36:29.620 --> 1:36:36.620
 And some people are lucky enough to have four or five interviews if something goes wrong or something goes awry with the first few interviews.

1:36:36.620 --> 1:36:39.620
 And again, this might be dated from when I went through.

1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:45.620
 But during the interview process is when they start, they do your psychological evaluations.

1:36:45.620 --> 1:36:50.620
 They do personality assessments.

1:36:50.620 --> 1:36:52.620
 They do skills assessments.

1:36:52.620 --> 1:36:57.620
 They'll start sending you back to wherever you're living with assignments.

1:36:57.620 --> 1:37:01.620
 Not intel assignments, but actual homework assignments.

1:37:01.620 --> 1:37:09.620
 Write an essay about three parts of the world that you think will be most impacted in the next three to five years,

1:37:09.620 --> 1:37:13.620
 or prioritize the top three strategic priorities for the United States,

1:37:13.620 --> 1:37:18.620
 and put it into 250 words or 2,500 words and whatever else.

1:37:18.620 --> 1:37:23.620
 Double spaced in this font, yada, yada, yada, like super specific stuff that's kind of stressful.

1:37:23.620 --> 1:37:25.620
 But it's just like going back to college again.

1:37:25.620 --> 1:37:32.620
 So you go through all of those acts and then you submit this stuff to some PO box that doesn't have anybody that's ever going to respond to you.

1:37:32.620 --> 1:37:37.620
 And then you hope you just send it into the ether and you hope that you sent it right.

1:37:37.620 --> 1:37:39.620
 You hope that you wrote well enough.

1:37:39.620 --> 1:37:42.620
 You hope that your assessment was right, whatever else it might be.

1:37:42.620 --> 1:37:46.620
 And then eventually get another phone call that says, hey, we received your package.

1:37:46.620 --> 1:37:48.620
 You've been moved to the next level of interview.

1:37:48.620 --> 1:37:52.620
 And now we need you to go to this other nondescript building in this other nondescript city.

1:37:52.620 --> 1:37:55.620
 And then you start meeting.

1:37:55.620 --> 1:38:02.620
 You start sitting in waiting rooms with other groups of people who are at the same phase of interview with you,

1:38:02.620 --> 1:38:05.620
 which were some of the coolest experiences that I remember still.

1:38:05.620 --> 1:38:09.620
 One of my best friends to this day, who I don't get to talk to because he's still undercover,

1:38:09.620 --> 1:38:11.620
 is a guy I met during those interview processes.

1:38:11.620 --> 1:38:13.620
 And I was like, oh, we met.

1:38:13.620 --> 1:38:14.620
 I saw what he was wearing.

1:38:14.620 --> 1:38:16.620
 He saw what I was wearing.

1:38:16.620 --> 1:38:19.620
 So you're immediately connected and you like the people there.

1:38:19.620 --> 1:38:23.620
 Close, more like we immediately judge each other because we're all untrained.

1:38:23.620 --> 1:38:27.620
 So he looked at me and he was like, brown dude with crazy hair.

1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:29.620
 And I was wearing, dude, I was dressed like a total ass.

1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:32.620
 I was dressed in like a clubbing shirt.

1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:38.620
 I don't know why I thought it'd be a good idea to go to a CIA interview in like a clubbing shirt with my buttons on button down to here.

1:38:38.620 --> 1:38:41.620
 And he was like, yeah, you were really after we got in.

1:38:41.620 --> 1:38:43.620
 He was like, yeah, dude, you were always really cool to talk to.

1:38:43.620 --> 1:38:46.620
 But I was like, there's no way that idiot's getting in.

1:38:46.620 --> 1:38:49.620
 And I remember looking at him and being like, dude, you were just another white guy in a black suit.

1:38:49.620 --> 1:38:52.620
 They're not looking for you, but here you are.

1:38:52.620 --> 1:38:56.620
 So it was just those kinds of things were so interesting because we were totally wrong about what CIA was looking for.

1:38:56.620 --> 1:38:59.620
 Until you're in, you have no idea what they're looking for.

1:38:59.620 --> 1:39:02.620
 And you're just shooting in the dark.

1:39:02.620 --> 1:39:05.620
 Did they have you do like a lie detector test?

1:39:05.620 --> 1:39:07.620
 Yes, it's called a polygraph.

1:39:07.620 --> 1:39:08.620
 Polygraph.

1:39:08.620 --> 1:39:12.620
 How effective, just interesting, our previous discussion, how effective are those?

1:39:12.620 --> 1:39:13.620
 Polygraphs are really interesting.

1:39:13.620 --> 1:39:18.620
 So one of the things that people don't understand about polygraphs is that polygraphs aren't meant to detect a lie.

1:39:18.620 --> 1:39:23.620
 Like they're called a lie detector, but they're not actually meant to detect a lie.

1:39:23.620 --> 1:39:28.620
 They're built to detect variants from your physiological baseline.

1:39:28.620 --> 1:39:34.620
 So they're essentially meant to identify sensitivities to certain types of questions.

1:39:34.620 --> 1:39:42.620
 And then as they identify a sensitivity to a question, it gives the interviewer an additional piece of information to direct the next round of questions.

1:39:42.620 --> 1:39:46.620
 So then from there, they can kind of see how sensitive you are to a certain level of questions.

1:39:46.620 --> 1:39:53.620
 And your sensitivity could be a sign of dishonesty, but it could also be a sign of vulnerability.

1:39:53.620 --> 1:40:00.620
 So the interrogator themselves, the interviewer themselves, they're the one that have to make the judgment call as to which one it is,

1:40:00.620 --> 1:40:05.620
 which is why you might see multiple interviewers over the course of multiple polygraphs.

1:40:05.620 --> 1:40:07.620
 But that's really what they're all about.

1:40:07.620 --> 1:40:12.620
 I mean, outside of, they're extremely uncomfortable, like they're mentally uncomfortable,

1:40:12.620 --> 1:40:17.620
 but then there's also, you sit on a pad because the pad is supposed to be able to tell like your body movements,

1:40:17.620 --> 1:40:21.620
 but also like your sphincter contractions or whatever.

1:40:21.620 --> 1:40:25.620
 So you're sitting on this pad, you're plugged in, you're strapped in, you're tied up,

1:40:25.620 --> 1:40:27.620
 and it takes so much time to get in there.

1:40:27.620 --> 1:40:32.620
 And then they start asking you questions, baseline questions at first, and then other questions from there.

1:40:32.620 --> 1:40:34.620
 And you're just answering the best you can.

1:40:34.620 --> 1:40:37.620
 And you never know what they're seeing and you don't know what they're doing.

1:40:37.620 --> 1:40:39.620
 And it's really hard not to get anxious of that anyways.

1:40:39.620 --> 1:40:42.620
 Are they the whole time monitoring the readings?

1:40:42.620 --> 1:40:47.620
 Yeah, from like a big, they've got multiple screens and they've got just, it's all information superiority.

1:40:47.620 --> 1:40:49.620
 They have information superiority.

1:40:49.620 --> 1:40:54.620
 You're the idiot looking away from them or looking sideways of them and trying not to move

1:40:54.620 --> 1:40:59.620
 because you're afraid that if you like have gas or if you move a little bit, it's going to vary you from your baseline.

1:40:59.620 --> 1:41:03.620
 And the whole time you're worried, your heart's racing and your blood pressure's increasing, which is a variance from baseline.

1:41:03.620 --> 1:41:04.620
 Yeah.

1:41:04.620 --> 1:41:06.620
 So yeah, that means it's an interesting art.

1:41:06.620 --> 1:41:07.620
 Or your baseline.

1:41:07.620 --> 1:41:08.620
 Correct.

1:41:08.620 --> 1:41:10.620
 Maybe there's some people that are just chilling the whole time.

1:41:10.620 --> 1:41:11.620
 And that's their baseline.

1:41:11.620 --> 1:41:12.620
 Right.

1:41:12.620 --> 1:41:13.620
 Right.

1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:14.620
 But that's what they're doing.

1:41:14.620 --> 1:41:15.620
 They're establishing a baseline.

1:41:15.620 --> 1:41:21.620
 I mean, I guess that means the polygraph is a skill that you develop to do it well.

1:41:21.620 --> 1:41:22.620
 Absolutely.

1:41:22.620 --> 1:41:26.620
 So when people talk about beating a lie detector, it's not that they're telling an effective lie.

1:41:26.620 --> 1:41:27.620
 That's not hard.

1:41:27.620 --> 1:41:30.620
 It's not hard to tell a lie to an interviewer.

1:41:30.620 --> 1:41:34.620
 And the interviewer doesn't care if you're being honest or not honest about a topic.

1:41:34.620 --> 1:41:36.620
 What they're looking for is sensitivity.

1:41:36.620 --> 1:41:40.620
 If they see no sensitivity, that's a big sign for them.

1:41:40.620 --> 1:41:43.620
 That's a big sign that you're probably a pathological liar.

1:41:43.620 --> 1:41:49.620
 If you show sensitivity to many things, then that's a sign that you're probably an anxious person.

1:41:49.620 --> 1:41:56.620
 And they can still reset their baseline because they can tell how your anxiety is increasing in 15 minute increments.

1:41:56.620 --> 1:41:58.620
 It's a unique skill.

1:41:58.620 --> 1:42:01.620
 I mean, a really good polygrapher is immensely valuable.

1:42:01.620 --> 1:42:06.620
 But yeah, it's the misnomers, the misconceptions about polygraphs are vast.

1:42:06.620 --> 1:42:09.620
 You also mentioned personality tests.

1:42:09.620 --> 1:42:10.620
 That's really interesting.

1:42:10.620 --> 1:42:13.620
 So how effective are personality tests?

1:42:13.620 --> 1:42:17.620
 One for the hiring process, but also for understanding a human being.

1:42:17.620 --> 1:42:20.620
 So personality is extremely important for understanding human being.

1:42:20.620 --> 1:42:23.620
 And I would say that there's a thousand different ways of looking at personality.

1:42:23.620 --> 1:42:27.620
 The only one that I count with any significance is the MBTI.

1:42:27.620 --> 1:42:31.620
 And the MBTI is what all the leading spy agencies around the world use as well.

1:42:31.620 --> 1:42:33.620
 Well, that's kind of interesting to hear.

1:42:33.620 --> 1:42:36.620
 So there's been criticisms of that kind of test.

1:42:36.620 --> 1:42:38.620
 There have been criticisms for a long time.

1:42:38.620 --> 1:42:40.620
 Yeah, and do you think there's value?

1:42:40.620 --> 1:42:41.620
 Absolutely.

1:42:41.620 --> 1:42:43.620
 And there's a few reasons why, right?

1:42:43.620 --> 1:42:48.620
 So first, MBTI makes the claim that your core personality doesn't change over time.

1:42:48.620 --> 1:42:51.620
 And that's how it's calibrated.

1:42:51.620 --> 1:42:55.620
 And one of the big arguments is that people say that your personality can change over time.

1:42:55.620 --> 1:42:59.620
 Now, in my experience, the MBTI is exactly correct.

1:42:59.620 --> 1:43:08.620
 Your core personality does not change because your core personality is defined as your personality when all resources are removed.

1:43:08.620 --> 1:43:15.620
 So essentially your emergency mode, your dire conditions, that is your core personality.

1:43:15.620 --> 1:43:18.620
 We can all act a little more extroverted.

1:43:18.620 --> 1:43:24.620
 We can all be a little more empathetic when we have tons of time and money and patience.

1:43:24.620 --> 1:43:28.620
 When you strip away all that time, money and patience, how empathetic are you?

1:43:28.620 --> 1:43:30.620
 How much do you like being around other people?

1:43:30.620 --> 1:43:32.620
 How much do you like being alone?

1:43:32.620 --> 1:43:36.620
 Do you make judgments or do you analyze information?

1:43:36.620 --> 1:43:41.620
 That's what's so powerful about MBTI is it's talking about what people are like when you strip away resources.

1:43:41.620 --> 1:43:45.620
 And then because it's so consistent, it's also only four codes.

1:43:45.620 --> 1:43:56.620
 It's super easy to be able to assess a human being through a dialogue, through a series of conversations to be able to hone in with high accuracy.

1:43:56.620 --> 1:44:00.620
 What is there for code, four letter code?

1:44:00.620 --> 1:44:03.620
 There's only 16 options and it becomes extremely valuable.

1:44:03.620 --> 1:44:07.620
 Is it perfectly precise and does everybody do it the same?

1:44:07.620 --> 1:44:14.620
 I mean, those things or the answers to those are no, but is it operationally useful in a short period of time?

1:44:14.620 --> 1:44:17.620
 That is a resoundingly powerful yes.

1:44:17.620 --> 1:44:22.620
 Yeah, I only know I think the first letter is introverted and extroverted, right?

1:44:22.620 --> 1:44:29.620
 I've taken the test before just like a crude version of the test and that's the same problem you have with IQ tests.

1:44:29.620 --> 1:44:34.620
 There's the right thorough way of doing it and there's like fun internet way.

1:44:34.620 --> 1:44:41.620
 And do you mind sharing what your personality...

1:44:41.620 --> 1:44:43.620
 My type index?

1:44:43.620 --> 1:44:44.620
 Yes.

1:44:44.620 --> 1:44:45.620
 I'm an ENTP.

1:44:45.620 --> 1:44:53.620
 That's an extrovert, intuitive, perceiver, thinker, ENTP, perceiver.

1:44:53.620 --> 1:44:58.620
 My wife is an ISFJ, which is the polar opposite of me.

1:44:58.620 --> 1:45:06.620
 E, I'm extroverted, she's introverted, I'm an intuitive, she's a sensor, I'm a thinker, she's a feeler, I'm a perceiver, she's a judge.

1:45:06.620 --> 1:45:14.620
 Is there good science unlike long term successful relationships in terms of the dynamics of that, the 16?

1:45:14.620 --> 1:45:16.620
 I wonder if there's good data on this.

1:45:16.620 --> 1:45:25.620
 I don't think there's a lot of good data in personalities writ large because there's not a lot of money to be made in personality testing.

1:45:25.620 --> 1:45:43.620
 But I would say that there's that with experience, with a good MBTI test, with a good paid test, a 400, 500 question test, once you understand your own code and then you're taught how to assess the code of others.

1:45:43.620 --> 1:45:54.620
 With those two things kind of combined, because then you have experience and learning, it becomes very useful and you can have high confidence in the conclusions that you read.

1:45:54.620 --> 1:46:08.620
 In the conclusions that you reach about people's professions, about people's relationships with family, about people's relationships professionally, people's capabilities to deal with stress, how people will perform when pushed outside of their comfort zones.

1:46:08.620 --> 1:46:13.620
 Really, really powerful, useful stuff in corporate world and in the espionage world.

1:46:13.620 --> 1:46:21.620
 So in terms of compressed representation of another human being, you can't do much better than those four letters.

1:46:21.620 --> 1:46:25.620
 I don't believe you can do much better. In my experience, I have not seen anything better.

1:46:25.620 --> 1:46:45.620
 Yeah, it is kind of, it's difficult to realize that there is a core personality or the degree that's true. It seems to be true. It's even more difficult to realize that there is a stable, or at least the science says so, stable, consistent intelligence.

1:46:45.620 --> 1:46:58.620
 Unfortunately, the G factor that they call, that if you do a barrage of IQ tests that's going to consistently represent that G factor and we're all born with that and we can't fix it.

1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:02.620
 That defines so much of who we are. It's sad.

1:47:02.620 --> 1:47:13.620
 I don't see it as sad because it's, for me, the faster you learn it, the faster you learn what your own sort of natural strengths and weaknesses are.

1:47:13.620 --> 1:47:23.620
 The faster you get to stop wasting time on things that you're never going to be good at and you get to double down on the things that you're already naturally skilled or interested in.

1:47:23.620 --> 1:47:33.620
 So there's always a silver lining to a cloud, but I know now that I will never be a ballerina or a ballerino. I know that I'll never be an artist. I'll never be a musician.

1:47:33.620 --> 1:47:40.620
 I'll never be any of those things. And when I was 18, that might have made me sad, but now at 42, I'm like, well, shit, awesome.

1:47:40.620 --> 1:47:43.620
 I can go be something else good instead of always being bad.

1:47:43.620 --> 1:47:45.620
 You're not going to be a ballerina.

1:47:45.620 --> 1:47:48.620
 Because I'm not graceful.

1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:51.620
 And you've learned this years of experience.

1:47:51.620 --> 1:47:52.620
 Yeah, exactly.

1:47:52.620 --> 1:47:56.620
 Well, I don't know if there's an MBTI equivalent for grace of movement.

1:47:56.620 --> 1:47:58.620
 I think it's called S sensor.

1:47:58.620 --> 1:47:59.620
 Oh, yeah.

1:47:59.620 --> 1:48:05.620
 Because a sensor is someone who's able to interact with the world around them through their five senses very effectively.

1:48:05.620 --> 1:48:10.620
 Like if you talk to dancers, dancers can actually feel the grace in all of their muscles.

1:48:10.620 --> 1:48:13.620
 They know what position their finger is in.

1:48:13.620 --> 1:48:15.620
 I don't have any idea. I don't know what position my feet are in right now.

1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:18.620
 I had to look to make sure I actually feel the floor right.

1:48:18.620 --> 1:48:21.620
 Yeah, I definitely have. Oh, that's good to know.

1:48:21.620 --> 1:48:25.620
 So I don't, you know, I'm not a dancer, but I do have that.

1:48:25.620 --> 1:48:26.620
 You're a musician, man.

1:48:26.620 --> 1:48:29.620
 Like, to be able to plug the guitar.

1:48:29.620 --> 1:48:35.620
 Yeah, that's true that there is a physical component, but I think deeper because there's a technical aspect to that.

1:48:35.620 --> 1:48:43.620
 That's just like, it's less about feel, but I do know jujitsu, you know, grappling I've done all my life.

1:48:43.620 --> 1:48:47.620
 I don't, you know, there's some people who are clumsy and they drop stuff all the time.

1:48:47.620 --> 1:48:48.620
 They run into stuff.

1:48:48.620 --> 1:48:51.620
 I don't, I don't, first of all, I don't know how that happens.

1:48:51.620 --> 1:48:54.620
 But to me, I just have an awareness of stuff.

1:48:54.620 --> 1:48:55.620
 Like if there's a little.

1:48:55.620 --> 1:48:56.620
 A spiritual orientation.

1:48:56.620 --> 1:49:03.620
 Yeah, like, like, I know that there's a small object I have to step over and I have a good sense of that.

1:49:03.620 --> 1:49:04.620
 It's so, it's so interesting.

1:49:04.620 --> 1:49:06.620
 Yeah, you're just like born with that or something.

1:49:06.620 --> 1:49:09.620
 My wife is brilliant and she still walks into doors.

1:49:09.620 --> 1:49:10.620
 Yeah.

1:49:10.620 --> 1:49:11.620
 I mean, she'll walk in a doorway.

1:49:11.620 --> 1:49:14.620
 She'll bang her knee on the same wall that's been there for the last 50 years.

1:49:14.620 --> 1:49:16.620
 It's, it's, it's for some reason really hilarious.

1:49:16.620 --> 1:49:17.620
 That's good.

1:49:17.620 --> 1:49:25.620
 You've been asked, I think on Reddit, are there big secrets that you know that could lend you

1:49:25.620 --> 1:49:30.620
 and our country in terrible trouble if he came out to the public and you answered yes.

1:49:30.620 --> 1:49:32.620
 I wish I could forget them.

1:49:32.620 --> 1:49:35.620
 So let me ask you just about secrecy in general.

1:49:35.620 --> 1:49:46.620
 Are these secrets or just other secrets, ones that the public will never know or will it come out in 10, 20, 50 years?

1:49:46.620 --> 1:49:52.620
 I guess the deeper question is what is the value of secrecy and transparency?

1:49:52.620 --> 1:50:02.620
 The standard classification for all human intelligence operations is something called 25x2, 25x2.

1:50:02.620 --> 1:50:06.620
 So 50 years, 25 years times two years or times two rounds.

1:50:06.620 --> 1:50:14.620
 So in essence, anything that I've seen has the first chance of becoming public domain,

1:50:14.620 --> 1:50:21.620
 declassified after 50 years, unless there's some congressional requirement for it to be reviewed and assessed earlier.

1:50:21.620 --> 1:50:28.620
 So by then, you know, I'll be 80 something years old or more potentially dead, which is either way.

1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:33.620
 That's when it's, it can come out according to its typical classification.

1:50:33.620 --> 1:50:43.620
 The, the value of secrets I, I have seen is that secrets create space.

1:50:43.620 --> 1:50:51.620
 Secrets give opportunity for security, they give opportunity for thinking, they give space.

1:50:51.620 --> 1:50:54.620
 And space is an incredibly advantageous thing to have.

1:50:54.620 --> 1:51:02.620
 If you know something somebody else doesn't know, even if it's just 15 or 20 minutes different, you can direct, you can change the course of fate.

1:51:02.620 --> 1:51:07.620
 So I find secrets to be extremely valuable, extremely useful.

1:51:07.620 --> 1:51:27.620
 Even at the place where secrets are being kept from a large mass, part of what all Americans need to understand is that one of the, one of the tradeoffs to building a system of government that allows us to be first world and wealthy and secure and successful.

1:51:27.620 --> 1:51:31.620
 One of the tradeoffs is that we have given up a great deal of personal freedom.

1:51:31.620 --> 1:51:38.620
 And one of the personal freedoms that we give up is the freedom of knowing what we want to know.

1:51:38.620 --> 1:51:46.620
 You get to know what the government tells you, you get to know what you need to know or what you've learned yourself, but you don't get to know secrets.

1:51:46.620 --> 1:51:49.620
 People who do get to know secrets know them for a reason.

1:51:49.620 --> 1:51:51.620
 That's why it's called a need to know.

1:51:51.620 --> 1:51:53.620
 How difficult is it to maintain secrecy?

1:51:53.620 --> 1:51:57.620
 It's surprisingly difficult as the, as technology changes.

1:51:57.620 --> 1:52:06.620
 It's also surprisingly difficult as our culture becomes one where people want notoriety.

1:52:06.620 --> 1:52:09.620
 People want to be the person who breaks the secret.

1:52:09.620 --> 1:52:12.620
 25 years ago, 40 years ago, that wasn't the case.

1:52:12.620 --> 1:52:19.620
 There was a time in the United States where if someone gave you a secret, it was a point of personal honor not to share the secret.

1:52:19.620 --> 1:52:26.620
 Now we're in a place where if someone tells you a secret, like that could turn into a Twitter post that gets you a bunch of thumbs up and a bunch of likes or whatever else.

1:52:26.620 --> 1:52:27.620
 An opportunity.

1:52:27.620 --> 1:52:28.620
 Right.

1:52:28.620 --> 1:52:30.620
 So the value of secrets has changed.

1:52:30.620 --> 1:52:35.620
 And now there's almost a greater value on exposing secrets than there is on keeping secrets.

1:52:35.620 --> 1:52:40.620
 That makes it difficult to keep secrets, especially when technology is going in the same direction.

1:52:40.620 --> 1:52:42.620
 Yeah, where is the line?

1:52:42.620 --> 1:52:45.620
 And by the way, I'm one of those old school people with the secrets.

1:52:45.620 --> 1:52:50.620
 I think it's a karma thing.

1:52:50.620 --> 1:52:56.620
 Again, back to the trust, I think in the short term, you can benefit by sharing a secret.

1:52:56.620 --> 1:53:04.620
 But in the long term, if people know they can trust you, like the juicy of the secret, it's a test of sorts.

1:53:04.620 --> 1:53:09.620
 If they know you can keep that secret, that means you're somebody that could be trusted.

1:53:09.620 --> 1:53:18.620
 And I believe that not just effectiveness in this life, but happiness in this life is informing a circle of people you can trust.

1:53:18.620 --> 1:53:23.620
 Right. We're taught that secrets and lies are similar in that they have a limited shelf life.

1:53:23.620 --> 1:53:28.620
 If you treat them like food, secrets and lies have a very limited shelf life.

1:53:28.620 --> 1:53:35.620
 So if you cash in on them while they're still fresh, you beat them before they spoil.

1:53:35.620 --> 1:53:37.620
 You get to take advantage before they spoil.

1:53:37.620 --> 1:53:42.620
 However, trust has no limit to its shelf life.

1:53:42.620 --> 1:53:47.620
 So it's almost like you're trading a short term victory and losing a long term victory.

1:53:47.620 --> 1:53:49.620
 It's always better to keep the secret.

1:53:49.620 --> 1:53:57.620
 It's always better to let the lie live because it will eventually come to light from somebody else, not from you,

1:53:57.620 --> 1:53:59.620
 because it already has a limited shelf life.

1:53:59.620 --> 1:54:07.620
 But what you win in exchange for not being the one that cashed in on the secret is immense trust.

1:54:07.620 --> 1:54:12.620
 Let me ask you about lying and trust and so on.

1:54:12.620 --> 1:54:20.620
 So I don't believe I've been contacted by or interacted with the CIA, the MI6, the FSB, Massad,

1:54:20.620 --> 1:54:23.620
 or any other intelligence agency.

1:54:23.620 --> 1:54:26.620
 I'm kind of offended.

1:54:26.620 --> 1:54:29.620
 But would I know if I was?

1:54:29.620 --> 1:54:31.620
 So from your perspective?

1:54:31.620 --> 1:54:33.620
 No, you would not know if you were.

1:54:33.620 --> 1:54:35.620
 For sure you've been on the radar.

1:54:35.620 --> 1:54:36.620
 Absolutely, you've got a file.

1:54:36.620 --> 1:54:38.620
 You've got a dossier somewhere.

1:54:38.620 --> 1:54:40.620
 Why would I be on the radar?

1:54:40.620 --> 1:54:42.620
 Who's interesting?

1:54:42.620 --> 1:54:51.620
 It's not necessarily that you are interesting to someone as a foreign asset or an intelligence collection source,

1:54:51.620 --> 1:54:54.620
 but your network is extremely interesting.

1:54:54.620 --> 1:54:55.620
 Networks are important.

1:54:55.620 --> 1:54:56.620
 Correct.

1:54:56.620 --> 1:55:04.620
 If someone was able to clone your phone, every time you cross a border, you go through some sort of security.

1:55:04.620 --> 1:55:07.620
 If you've ever been pulled into secondary and separated from your bag,

1:55:07.620 --> 1:55:10.620
 that's exactly when and how people clone computers.

1:55:10.620 --> 1:55:11.620
 They clone phones.

1:55:11.620 --> 1:55:17.620
 They make whatever, photocopies of your old school planner, whatever it might be.

1:55:17.620 --> 1:55:22.620
 But for sure, you are an intelligence target.

1:55:22.620 --> 1:55:28.620
 It just may be that you're not suitable to be a person who reports foreign intelligence.

1:55:28.620 --> 1:55:35.620
 We've got to understand that all people are potential sources of valuable information to the national security infrastructure

1:55:35.620 --> 1:55:38.620
 of our host country and any country that we visit.

1:55:38.620 --> 1:55:43.620
 Someone like you with your public footprint, with your notoriety, with your educational background,

1:55:43.620 --> 1:55:50.620
 with your national identifications becomes a viable and valuable target of information.

1:55:50.620 --> 1:56:03.620
 To speak to that, I take security pretty seriously, but not to the degree that it runs my life,

1:56:03.620 --> 1:56:05.620
 which I'm very careful about.

1:56:05.620 --> 1:56:06.620
 That's good.

1:56:06.620 --> 1:56:07.620
 I'm glad to hear that.

1:56:07.620 --> 1:56:16.620
 The moment you start to think about germs, you start to freak out and you become sort of paralyzed by the stress of it.

1:56:16.620 --> 1:56:20.620
 You have to balance those two things.

1:56:20.620 --> 1:56:28.620
 If you think about all the things that can hurt you in this world and all the risk you can take, it can overwhelm your life.

1:56:28.620 --> 1:56:34.620
 That said, the cyber world is a weird world because it doesn't have the same...

1:56:34.620 --> 1:56:41.620
 I know not to cross the street without looking each way because there's a physical intuition about it.

1:56:41.620 --> 1:56:43.620
 I'm not sure.

1:56:43.620 --> 1:56:51.620
 I'm a computer science guy, so I have some intuition, but the cyber world, it's really hard to build up an intuition

1:56:51.620 --> 1:56:52.620
 what is safe and not.

1:56:52.620 --> 1:56:59.620
 I've seen a lot of people just logging out of your devices regularly.

1:56:59.620 --> 1:57:03.620
 That physical access stuff, a lot of people don't take.

1:57:03.620 --> 1:57:13.620
 I can just walk into the offices of a lot of CEOs and everything is wide open for physical access of those systems,

1:57:13.620 --> 1:57:16.620
 which is kind of incredible for somebody...

1:57:16.620 --> 1:57:18.620
 That sounds really shady, but it's not.

1:57:18.620 --> 1:57:23.620
 I've written keyloggers, things that record everything you type in the policy mood.

1:57:23.620 --> 1:57:27.620
 I did that during my PhD.

1:57:27.620 --> 1:57:32.620
 I was recording everything you do on your device and everything you do on your computer.

1:57:32.620 --> 1:57:34.620
 People sign up to the study.

1:57:34.620 --> 1:57:37.620
 They willingly do this to understand behavior.

1:57:37.620 --> 1:57:43.620
 I was trying to use machine learning to identify who you are based on different biometric and behavioral things,

1:57:43.620 --> 1:57:49.620
 which allows me to study human behavior and to see which is uniquely identifiable.

1:57:49.620 --> 1:57:52.620
 The goal there was to remove the need for a password.

1:57:52.620 --> 1:57:57.620
 How easy it is to write a thing that logs everything you type?

1:57:57.620 --> 1:57:59.620
 I was like, wait a minute.

1:57:59.620 --> 1:58:03.620
 I can probably get a lot of people in the world to run this for me.

1:58:03.620 --> 1:58:07.620
 I can then get all of their passwords.

1:58:07.620 --> 1:58:16.620
 You could do so much... I can run the entirety of the CIA just myself.

1:58:16.620 --> 1:58:22.620
 I imagine there's a lot of really good hackers like that out there, much better than me.

1:58:22.620 --> 1:58:29.620
 I try to prevent myself from being all the different low hanging fruit attack vectors in my life.

1:58:29.620 --> 1:58:33.620
 I try to make it difficult to be that.

1:58:33.620 --> 1:58:38.620
 I'm also aware that there's probably people that are like five steps ahead.

1:58:38.620 --> 1:58:40.620
 You're doing the right thing.

1:58:40.620 --> 1:58:46.620
 What I always advocate is the low hanging fruit is what keeps you from being a target of opportunity

1:58:46.620 --> 1:58:52.620
 because you're half assed hackers, you're lazy hackers, you're unskilled hackers.

1:58:52.620 --> 1:58:54.620
 They're looking for low hanging fruit.

1:58:54.620 --> 1:59:00.620
 They're looking for the person who gets the Nigeria email about how you could be getting $5 million if you just give me your bank account.

1:59:00.620 --> 1:59:02.620
 That's what they're looking for.

1:59:02.620 --> 1:59:11.620
 The thing that's scary is that if you're not a target of opportunity, if you become an intentional target, then there's almost nothing you can do.

1:59:11.620 --> 1:59:26.620
 Because once you become an intentional target, then your security apparatus, they will create a dedicated, customized way vector of attacking your specific security apparatus.

1:59:26.620 --> 1:59:33.620
 Because security is always after, there's the leading advantage and the trailing advantage.

1:59:33.620 --> 1:59:43.620
 When it comes to attacks, the leader always has the advantage because they have to create the attack before anybody else can create a way to protect against the attack.

1:59:43.620 --> 1:59:46.620
 So the attack always comes first and that means they always have the advantage.

1:59:46.620 --> 1:59:51.620
 You are always stuck just leaning on, this is the best security that I know of.

1:59:51.620 --> 1:59:56.620
 Meanwhile, there's always somebody who can create a way of attacking the best security out there.

1:59:56.620 --> 1:59:58.620
 And once they win, they have a monopoly.

1:59:58.620 --> 2:00:03.620
 They have all that time until a new defensive countermeasure is deployed.

2:00:03.620 --> 2:00:10.620
 Yeah, I tend to think exactly as you said that the low hanging fruit protects against crimes of opportunity.

2:00:10.620 --> 2:00:16.620
 And then I assume that people can just hack in if they really want.

2:00:16.620 --> 2:00:20.620
 Think about how much anxiety we would be able to solve if everybody just accepted that.

2:00:20.620 --> 2:00:22.620
 Well, there's several things you do.

2:00:22.620 --> 2:00:27.620
 First of all, to be honest, it keeps me honest.

2:00:27.620 --> 2:00:39.620
 Not to be a douchebag or to assume everything could be public.

2:00:39.620 --> 2:00:45.620
 And so don't trade information that could hurt people if it was made public.

2:00:45.620 --> 2:00:47.620
 So I try to do that.

2:00:47.620 --> 2:00:53.620
 And the thing I try to make sure is I like home alone style.

2:00:53.620 --> 2:00:58.620
 I really would like to know if I was hacked.

2:00:58.620 --> 2:00:59.620
 Right.

2:00:59.620 --> 2:01:05.620
 And so I try to assume that I will be hacked and detected.

2:01:05.620 --> 2:01:07.620
 Have a tripwire or something.

2:01:07.620 --> 2:01:09.620
 Yeah, a tripwires through everything.

2:01:09.620 --> 2:01:13.620
 And not paranoid tripwires, just like open door.

2:01:13.620 --> 2:01:21.620
 I think that's probably the future of life on this earth is everybody of interest is going to be hacked.

2:01:21.620 --> 2:01:22.620
 That hopefully inspires.

2:01:22.620 --> 2:01:24.620
 No, this is outside of company.

2:01:24.620 --> 2:01:26.620
 These are individuals.

2:01:26.620 --> 2:01:36.620
 Of course, if you're actually operating, like I'm just the scientist person, podcasting person.

2:01:36.620 --> 2:01:46.620
 If I was actually running a company or was an integral part of some kind of military operation,

2:01:46.620 --> 2:01:57.620
 then you have to probably have to have an entire team that's now doing that battle of like being trying to be ahead of like the best hackers in the world that are attacking.

2:01:57.620 --> 2:02:01.620
 But that requires a team that like full time is their focus.

2:02:01.620 --> 2:02:03.620
 And then you still get in trouble.

2:02:03.620 --> 2:02:04.620
 Correct.

2:02:04.620 --> 2:02:06.620
 What I've seen as the norm.

2:02:06.620 --> 2:02:18.620
 Well, what I've seen is the cutting edge standard for corporations and the ultra and the ultra wealthy and even intelligence organizations is that we have tripwires.

2:02:18.620 --> 2:02:22.620
 It's better if you can't prevent from being hacked.

2:02:22.620 --> 2:02:29.620
 The next best thing is to know as soon as you get hacked, because then you can essentially terminate all the information.

2:02:29.620 --> 2:02:32.620
 If you know it fast enough, you can just destroy the information.

2:02:32.620 --> 2:02:33.620
 This is what the ultra wealthy do.

2:02:33.620 --> 2:02:35.620
 They have multiple phones.

2:02:35.620 --> 2:02:41.620
 So as soon as one phone gets hacked, the tripwire goes off, the operating system is totally deleted along with all data on the phone.

2:02:41.620 --> 2:02:46.620
 And a second phone is turned on with a whole new separate set of metadata.

2:02:46.620 --> 2:02:49.620
 And now they, for them, there's no break in service.

2:02:49.620 --> 2:02:51.620
 It's just, oh, this phone went black.

2:02:51.620 --> 2:02:53.620
 It's got a warning on it that says it was hacked.

2:02:53.620 --> 2:02:55.620
 So trash it because they don't care about the price of the phone.

2:02:55.620 --> 2:02:57.620
 Pick up the next phone and we move on.

2:02:57.620 --> 2:03:02.620
 That's the best thing that you can do essentially outside of trying to out hack the hackers.

2:03:02.620 --> 2:03:15.620
 And then even in your intelligence and military worlds where the cyber warfare is active, the people who are aggressing are not trying to create aggression that beats security.

2:03:15.620 --> 2:03:22.620
 They're trying to find aggressive techniques, offensive techniques that have no security built around them yet.

2:03:22.620 --> 2:03:27.620
 Because it's too cost and time intensive to protect against what you know is coming.

2:03:27.620 --> 2:03:32.620
 It's so much more efficient and cost effective to go after new vectors.

2:03:32.620 --> 2:03:40.620
 So it just becomes like, it becomes the most silly game of your neighbor gets a guard dog.

2:03:40.620 --> 2:03:44.620
 So you get a bigger guard dog and then your neighbor gets a fence.

2:03:44.620 --> 2:03:46.620
 So you're just constantly out doing each other.

2:03:46.620 --> 2:03:48.620
 It's called the security paradigm.

2:03:48.620 --> 2:03:52.620
 People just, they just one up each other because it's never worth it to just get to the same level.

2:03:52.620 --> 2:03:54.620
 You're always trying to out do each other.

2:03:54.620 --> 2:03:59.620
 Yeah, then maybe like banks have to fight that fight, but not everybody can.

2:03:59.620 --> 2:04:00.620
 Yeah, no.

2:04:00.620 --> 2:04:03.620
 So you're saying I operated at the state of the art with the tripwires.

2:04:03.620 --> 2:04:04.620
 This is good to know.

2:04:04.620 --> 2:04:05.620
 Absolutely, man.

2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:11.620
 And also just not using anybody else's services doing everything myself.

2:04:11.620 --> 2:04:14.620
 So that's harder to figure out what the heck this person is doing.

2:04:14.620 --> 2:04:19.620
 Because if I'm using somebody else's service, like I did with QNAP.

2:04:19.620 --> 2:04:27.620
 I have a QNAP NAS I use for cold storage of unimportant things, but a large videos.

2:04:27.620 --> 2:04:33.620
 And I don't know if you know, but QNAP is a company that does NAS storage devices and they got hacked.

2:04:33.620 --> 2:04:42.620
 And everybody that didn't update as of a week ago from the point of the zero day hack, everybody got hacked.

2:04:42.620 --> 2:04:50.620
 It's several thousands of machines and they asked, you can get your data back if you pay.

2:04:50.620 --> 2:04:55.620
 I forget what it was, but it was about a couple of thousand dollars.

2:04:55.620 --> 2:05:01.620
 And QNAP can get all the data back for their customers if they pay, I think $2 million.

2:05:01.620 --> 2:05:05.620
 But that came for me relying on the systems of others for security.

2:05:05.620 --> 2:05:10.620
 I assumed this company would have their security handled.

2:05:10.620 --> 2:05:12.620
 But then that was a very valuable lesson to me.

2:05:12.620 --> 2:05:20.620
 I now have like layers of security and also an understanding which data is really important,

2:05:20.620 --> 2:05:25.620
 which is somewhat important, which is not that important and layering that all together.

2:05:25.620 --> 2:05:30.620
 So just so you know, the US government, the military woke up to that exact same thing about two years ago.

2:05:30.620 --> 2:05:32.620
 It's still very new.

2:05:32.620 --> 2:05:36.620
 I mean, they were sourcing, take night vision goggles, for example.

2:05:36.620 --> 2:05:44.620
 They were sourcing components and engineering and blueprints for night vision goggles from 3, 4, 5 different subcontractors all over the country.

2:05:44.620 --> 2:05:49.620
 But they never asked themselves what the security status was of those self, of those subcontractors.

2:05:49.620 --> 2:05:57.620
 So, you know, fast forward a few years and all of a sudden they start getting faulty components.

2:05:57.620 --> 2:05:59.620
 They start having night vision goggles that don't work.

2:05:59.620 --> 2:06:03.620
 They start having supply chain issues where they have to change their provider.

2:06:03.620 --> 2:06:06.620
 And the army doesn't know that the provider is changing.

2:06:06.620 --> 2:06:08.620
 I mean, this is a strategy.

2:06:08.620 --> 2:06:14.620
 The idea of going through third party systems is identifying the vulnerability in the supply chain.

2:06:14.620 --> 2:06:23.620
 That's a savvy offensive practice for more than just, you know, cyber hackers.

2:06:23.620 --> 2:06:25.620
 Let me ask you about physical hacking.

2:06:25.620 --> 2:06:35.620
 So, I'm now, like I'm introverts, I'm paranoid about all social interaction, but how much truth is there?

2:06:35.620 --> 2:06:36.620
 It's kind of a funny question.

2:06:36.620 --> 2:06:45.620
 How suspicious should I be when I'm traveling in Ukraine or different parts of the world when an attractive female walks up to me and shows any kind of attention?

2:06:45.620 --> 2:06:53.620
 Is that like this kind of James Bond spy movie stuff or is that kind of stuff used by intelligence agencies?

2:06:53.620 --> 2:06:55.620
 I don't think it's used.

2:06:55.620 --> 2:06:56.620
 It's absolutely used.

2:06:56.620 --> 2:06:58.620
 It's called sex biennage.

2:06:58.620 --> 2:07:01.620
 That's the term that we jokingly call it is sex biennage.

2:07:01.620 --> 2:07:13.620
 But yeah, the art of attraction, appeal, the manifestation of feelings through sexual manipulation, all of that is a super powerful tool.

2:07:13.620 --> 2:07:15.620
 The Chinese use it extremely well.

2:07:15.620 --> 2:07:17.620
 The Russians use it extremely well.

2:07:17.620 --> 2:07:27.620
 In the United States, we actively train our officers not to use it because in the end it leads to complications and how you professionally run a case.

2:07:27.620 --> 2:07:29.620
 So we train our officers not to use it.

2:07:29.620 --> 2:07:32.620
 However, you can't control what other people think.

2:07:32.620 --> 2:07:46.620
 So if you're an attractive male or an attractive female officer and you're trying to talk to an older general who just happens to be gay or happens to be straight and is attracted to you, of course, they're going to be that much more willing to talk to an American.

2:07:46.620 --> 2:07:48.620
 Who is also attractive?

2:07:48.620 --> 2:07:51.620
 Well, it's an attractive in all definitions.

2:07:51.620 --> 2:07:54.620
 So it could be all elements of charisma.

2:07:54.620 --> 2:08:00.620
 So attractiveness in a dynamic sense of the word.

2:08:00.620 --> 2:08:10.620
 So it's visual attractiveness, but the smile, the humor, the wit, the flirting, all that kind of stuff that could be used to the art of conversation.

2:08:10.620 --> 2:08:14.620
 There's also elements of sexuality that people underestimate.

2:08:14.620 --> 2:08:17.620
 So physical sexuality, physical attraction is the most obvious one.

2:08:17.620 --> 2:08:20.620
 It's the one that everybody talks about and thinks about.

2:08:20.620 --> 2:08:28.620
 But then there's also sapiosexuality, which is being sexually attracted to thoughts, to intelligence.

2:08:28.620 --> 2:08:33.620
 And then you've got all the various varieties of personal preferences.

2:08:33.620 --> 2:08:43.620
 Some people like people with a certain color skin or they like big noses, they like small noses, they like big butts, they like small butts, they like tall guys, they like bald guys, whatever it might be.

2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:50.620
 You can't ever predict what someone's preferences, sexual arousal preferences are going to be.

2:08:50.620 --> 2:08:56.620
 So then you end up walking into a situation where then you discover, you know, and just imagine.

2:08:56.620 --> 2:09:08.620
 Imagine being an unattractive, overweight, married guy and you're walking into an asset or a target meeting with like a middle aged female who is also not very attractive and also married.

2:09:08.620 --> 2:09:14.620
 But then it turns out that that person is a sapiosexual and gets extremely turned on by intelligent conversation.

2:09:14.620 --> 2:09:16.620
 That's exactly what you're there to do.

2:09:16.620 --> 2:09:22.620
 Your mission is to have intelligent conversation with this person to find out if they have access to secrets.

2:09:22.620 --> 2:09:26.620
 And by virtue of you carrying out your mission, they become extremely aroused and attracted to you.

2:09:26.620 --> 2:09:29.620
 That is a very complicated situation.

2:09:29.620 --> 2:09:30.620
 It's hard to know who to trust.

2:09:30.620 --> 2:09:36.620
 Like how do you know your wife, how does your wife know that you're not a double agent from Russia?

2:09:36.620 --> 2:09:42.620
 There's a large element of experience and time that goes into that.

2:09:42.620 --> 2:09:44.620
 She's also trained.

2:09:44.620 --> 2:09:56.620
 And I think my wife and I also have the benefit of being recruited young and together where...

2:09:56.620 --> 2:10:01.620
 So over time, you can start to figure out things that are very difficult to do.

2:10:01.620 --> 2:10:05.620
 So you form the baseline, you start to understand the person is very, it becomes very difficult to lie.

2:10:05.620 --> 2:10:07.620
 The most difficult thing in the world is consistency.

2:10:07.620 --> 2:10:09.620
 It's the most difficult thing in the world.

2:10:09.620 --> 2:10:14.620
 Some people say that discipline or self discipline, what they're really talking about is consistency.

2:10:14.620 --> 2:10:19.620
 When you have someone who performs consistently over long periods of time under various levels of stress,

2:10:19.620 --> 2:10:23.620
 you have high, high confidence that that is the person that you can trust.

2:10:23.620 --> 2:10:29.620
 You can trust, again, you can trust them to behave within a certain pattern.

2:10:29.620 --> 2:10:35.620
 You can trust an asshole to be an asshole without trusting the asshole to take care of your kids.

2:10:35.620 --> 2:10:41.620
 So I don't ever want to mix up the idea of personal trust versus trusting the outcome.

2:10:41.620 --> 2:10:45.620
 You can always trust a person to operate within their pattern of behavior.

2:10:45.620 --> 2:10:51.620
 It just takes time for you to get consistent feedback as to what that baseline is for them.

2:10:51.620 --> 2:10:56.620
 To form a good model, predictive model of what their behavior is going to be like.

2:10:56.620 --> 2:11:02.620
 Right. And what's fascinating is I think the challenge is building that model quickly.

2:11:02.620 --> 2:11:09.620
 So technology is one of those tools that will be able in the future to very quickly create a model of behavior

2:11:09.620 --> 2:11:14.620
 because technology can pull in multiple data points in a very short period of time

2:11:14.620 --> 2:11:19.620
 that the human brain simply can't pull in at the same space, at the same speed.

2:11:19.620 --> 2:11:26.620
 That's actually what I did in my PhD on. That's what I did at Google is forming a good representation,

2:11:26.620 --> 2:11:30.620
 unique representation across the entire world based on the behavior of the person.

2:11:30.620 --> 2:11:35.620
 The specific task there is so that you don't have to type in the password.

2:11:35.620 --> 2:11:37.620
 The idea was to replace the password.

2:11:37.620 --> 2:11:41.620
 But it also allows you to actually study human behavior and to think,

2:11:41.620 --> 2:11:44.620
 what is the unique representation of a person?

2:11:44.620 --> 2:11:50.620
 Because we have very specific patterns and a lot of humans are very similar in those patterns.

2:11:50.620 --> 2:11:54.620
 What are the unique identifiers within those patterns of behavior?

2:11:54.620 --> 2:11:58.620
 And I think that's from a psychology perspective, a super fascinating question.

2:11:58.620 --> 2:12:01.620
 And from a machine learning perspective, it's something that you can,

2:12:01.620 --> 2:12:07.620
 as the systems get better and better and better and as we get more and more digital data about each individual,

2:12:07.620 --> 2:12:11.620
 you start to be able to do that kind of thing effectively.

2:12:11.620 --> 2:12:16.620
 And it's, I mean, when I think of the fact that you could create a dossier on somebody in a matter of 24 or 48 hours,

2:12:16.620 --> 2:12:21.620
 if you could wire them for two days, right, Internet of Things style,

2:12:21.620 --> 2:12:23.620
 you put it in their underwear or whatever, right?

2:12:23.620 --> 2:12:25.620
 Some chip that just reads everything.

2:12:25.620 --> 2:12:28.620
 How heavy are they walking? How much time do they sleep?

2:12:28.620 --> 2:12:30.620
 How many times do they open the refrigerator?

2:12:30.620 --> 2:12:32.620
 When they log into their computer, how do they do it?

2:12:32.620 --> 2:12:34.620
 Which hand do they use when they log in?

2:12:34.620 --> 2:12:37.620
 What's their most common swipe? What's their most visited website?

2:12:37.620 --> 2:12:42.620
 You could collect an enormous amount of normative data in a short period of time

2:12:42.620 --> 2:12:46.620
 where otherwise we're stuck the way that we do it now.

2:12:46.620 --> 2:12:50.620
 Once or twice a week, we go out for a coffee for two hours.

2:12:50.620 --> 2:12:54.620
 And two hours at a time over the course of six, eight weeks, 12 weeks,

2:12:54.620 --> 2:12:59.620
 you're coming up with a 50% assessment on how you think this person is going to behave.

2:12:59.620 --> 2:13:02.620
 Just that time savings is immense.

2:13:02.620 --> 2:13:10.620
 Something you've also spoken about is private intelligence and the power and the reach and the scale

2:13:10.620 --> 2:13:13.620
 and the importance of private intelligence versus government intelligence.

2:13:13.620 --> 2:13:16.620
 Can you elaborate on the role of what is private intelligence

2:13:16.620 --> 2:13:21.620
 and what's the role of private intelligence in the scope of all the intelligence

2:13:21.620 --> 2:13:26.620
 that is gathered and used in the United States?

2:13:26.620 --> 2:13:30.620
 Yeah, absolutely. It's something that so few people know about.

2:13:30.620 --> 2:13:35.620
 And it became a more mainstream topic with the Trump administration

2:13:35.620 --> 2:13:39.620
 because Trump made it no secret that he was going to hire private intelligence organizations

2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:42.620
 to run his intelligence operations and fund them.

2:13:42.620 --> 2:13:44.620
 So that really brought it to the mainstream.

2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:48.620
 But going all the way back to 9.11, going all the way back to 2001,

2:13:48.620 --> 2:13:55.620
 when the 9.11 attacks happened, there was a commission that was formed

2:13:55.620 --> 2:14:00.620
 to determine the reasons that 9.11 happened.

2:14:00.620 --> 2:14:02.620
 And among the lists that they determined, of course,

2:14:02.620 --> 2:14:05.620
 they found out that the intelligence community wasn't coordinating well with each other.

2:14:05.620 --> 2:14:09.620
 There were fiefdoms and there was infighting and there wasn't good intel sharing.

2:14:09.620 --> 2:14:15.620
 But more than that, they identified that we were operating at Cold War levels,

2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:21.620
 even though we were living in a time when terrorism was the new biggest threat to national security.

2:14:21.620 --> 2:14:26.620
 So the big recommendation coming out of the 9.11 commission was that the intelligence organizations,

2:14:26.620 --> 2:14:31.620
 the intelligence community, significantly increased the presence of intelligence operators,

2:14:31.620 --> 2:14:37.620
 overseas and in terms of analytical capacity here in the United States.

2:14:37.620 --> 2:14:41.620
 When they made that decision, it completely destroyed,

2:14:41.620 --> 2:14:45.620
 it totally was incongruent with the existing hiring process

2:14:45.620 --> 2:14:50.620
 because the existing hiring process for CIA or NSA is a six to nine month process.

2:14:50.620 --> 2:14:57.620
 The only way they could plus up their sizes fast enough was to bypass their own hiring

2:14:57.620 --> 2:15:00.620
 and instead go direct to private organizations.

2:15:00.620 --> 2:15:07.620
 So naturally, the government contracted with the companies that they already had secure contracts with,

2:15:07.620 --> 2:15:12.620
 Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Kaki, you name it.

2:15:12.620 --> 2:15:17.620
 And then over time from 2001 to now, or that started really in 2004

2:15:17.620 --> 2:15:22.620
 when they started significantly increasing their presence of private intelligence officers.

2:15:22.620 --> 2:15:26.620
 From then until now, it's become a budgetary thing.

2:15:26.620 --> 2:15:30.620
 It's become a continuity of operations thing.

2:15:30.620 --> 2:15:37.620
 And now the reason Northern Virginia has become one of the wealthiest zip codes in America

2:15:37.620 --> 2:15:41.620
 is because of the incredible concentration of private intelligence

2:15:41.620 --> 2:15:46.620
 that is supporting CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI and all the slew of IC partners.

2:15:46.620 --> 2:15:49.620
 By the way, does Palantir play a role in this?

2:15:49.620 --> 2:15:55.620
 Palantir is one of those organizations that was trying to pitch their product to an intelligence community

2:15:55.620 --> 2:16:00.620
 because it's a fantastic product on paper.

2:16:00.620 --> 2:16:06.620
 But the challenge was the proprietary services, the proprietary systems that we current,

2:16:06.620 --> 2:16:12.620
 that we used in CIA prior to Palantir, continued to outperform Palantir.

2:16:12.620 --> 2:16:19.620
 So just like any other business decision, if you've got homegrown systems that outperform external systems

2:16:19.620 --> 2:16:22.620
 and it's not worth it to share the internal information.

2:16:22.620 --> 2:16:23.620
 Got it.

2:16:23.620 --> 2:16:30.620
 So the close connection between Peter Thiel and Donald Trump,

2:16:30.620 --> 2:16:39.620
 did that have a role to play in Donald Trump's leveraging of private intelligence or is that completely disjoint?

2:16:39.620 --> 2:16:44.620
 I think that they're related but only circumstantially.

2:16:44.620 --> 2:16:48.620
 Because remember, Donald Trump wasn't really investing in CIA.

2:16:48.620 --> 2:16:53.620
 So the last thing he wanted to do was spend his network, WASTA.

2:16:53.620 --> 2:16:55.620
 WASTA is a term that we call influence.

2:16:55.620 --> 2:16:57.620
 It's an Arabic term for influence.

2:16:57.620 --> 2:17:04.620
 Trump didn't want to use his WASTA putting Thiel into CIA only to lose Thiel's contract as soon as Trump loft office.

2:17:04.620 --> 2:17:08.620
 So instead it was more valuable to put Peter Thiel's tool to use in private intelligence

2:17:08.620 --> 2:17:14.620
 and then of course I think he nominated Peter Thiel to be his secretary of defense, secretary of state.

2:17:14.620 --> 2:17:22.620
 At some point in time, he tried to present like presidentially appoint Peter Thiel into a position of government authority.

2:17:22.620 --> 2:17:27.620
 What do you think of figures like Peter Thiel?

2:17:27.620 --> 2:17:36.620
 Do they wield, and I'm sure there's figures of similar scale and reach and power in private intelligence.

2:17:36.620 --> 2:17:46.620
 What do you think about their role and power in this whole without public accountability that you would think directors of CIA perhaps have?

2:17:46.620 --> 2:17:52.620
 So this is where private intelligence has both a strength and a weakness.

2:17:52.620 --> 2:18:02.620
 The ultimate law that's overseeing private intelligence is not government legislation.

2:18:02.620 --> 2:18:04.620
 It's the law of economics.

2:18:04.620 --> 2:18:08.620
 If they produce a superior product, then they will have a buyer.

2:18:08.620 --> 2:18:12.620
 If they do not produce a superior product, they will not have a buyer.

2:18:12.620 --> 2:18:15.620
 And that's a very simple business principle.

2:18:15.620 --> 2:18:24.620
 Whereas in the current national security infrastructure, you can create a crap product, but the taxpayer dollars are always going to be spent.

2:18:24.620 --> 2:18:29.620
 So it's really thrown things for a loop, especially during the Trump administration.

2:18:29.620 --> 2:18:34.620
 And this is one of the things that I will always say I liked about the Trump administration.

2:18:34.620 --> 2:18:41.620
 It put a big blazing bright light on all of the flaws within our system.

2:18:41.620 --> 2:18:54.620
 One of those flaws being this executive power over the intelligence organizations and the lack of accountability for intelligence organizations to produce a superior product.

2:18:54.620 --> 2:19:05.620
 When that light got shown down, that's when you also saw Trump start to go after, if you remember, there was a period where he was taking security clearances away from retiring officers.

2:19:05.620 --> 2:19:08.620
 That became a big hot issue.

2:19:08.620 --> 2:19:21.620
 That became something that people were very opposed to when they didn't realize that that process of taking security clearances away, that incentivized seasoned senior officers to stay in service.

2:19:21.620 --> 2:19:28.620
 Because with private intelligence paying a premium during the Trump administration, because Trump was paying a premium to the private intelligence world,

2:19:28.620 --> 2:19:36.620
 when senior officers found that it was more profitable to retire early, keep their clearance and go work for Raytheon,

2:19:36.620 --> 2:19:40.620
 Trump saw that as bypassing service to the American people.

2:19:40.620 --> 2:19:44.620
 You've made a career in CIA, you've made a career in NSA, you should stay there.

2:19:44.620 --> 2:19:48.620
 If you leave, you lose your clearance because you no longer have a need to know.

2:19:48.620 --> 2:19:51.620
 He upset the apple cart with that.

2:19:51.620 --> 2:20:00.620
 Unfortunately, the narrative that came out in many ways was a negative narrative against Trump when, in fact, he was actually doing quite a service to the American people,

2:20:00.620 --> 2:20:09.620
 trying to take away the incentive of senior officials leaving their service in order to just profit here in the private intelligence world.

2:20:09.620 --> 2:20:23.620
 So in that way, he was kind of supporting the CIA in making sure that competent people and experienced people stay in, say, incentivized to stay there.

2:20:23.620 --> 2:20:28.620
 Correct. I think that there was definitely, he understood incentives.

2:20:28.620 --> 2:20:31.620
 I mean, Donald Trump understands incentives.

2:20:31.620 --> 2:20:41.620
 So he was trying to incentivize them to stay, but I think he was also playing a safety card because he didn't want former CIA officials who were not listening to him

2:20:41.620 --> 2:20:49.620
 to then move into private intelligence organizations that he may be hiring, only to then have them undermine him from both sides of the coin.

2:20:49.620 --> 2:20:53.620
 So there was a little bit of offensive calculation in there as well.

2:20:53.620 --> 2:21:06.620
 But do the dynamics and the incentives of economics that you referred to that the private intelligence operates under, is that more or less ethical than the forces that maybe government agencies operate under?

2:21:06.620 --> 2:21:10.620
 Like, what's your intuition? Is capitalism lead?

2:21:10.620 --> 2:21:25.620
 You mentioned it leads to maximizations of efficiency and performance, but is that correlated with ethical behavior when we're talking about such hairy activities like collection of intelligence?

2:21:25.620 --> 2:21:27.620
 The question of ethics is a great question.

2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:41.620
 So let me start this whole thing out by saying CIA hires people on a spectrum of our ability to be morally flexible, ethically flexible.

2:21:41.620 --> 2:21:44.620
 All people at their heart are ethically flexible.

2:21:44.620 --> 2:21:47.620
 I would never punch somebody in the face, right?

2:21:47.620 --> 2:21:56.620
 Some people out there would say, I would never hurt another human being, but as soon as a human being posed a direct threat to their daughter or their son or their mother,

2:21:56.620 --> 2:22:00.620
 now all of a sudden they're going to change their ethical stance in self defense.

2:22:00.620 --> 2:22:04.620
 But at the end of the day, it's still hurting another person.

2:22:04.620 --> 2:22:17.620
 So what CIA looks for is people who are able to swing across that spectrum for lesser offenses, more flexibility.

2:22:17.620 --> 2:22:29.620
 I do not believe that private intelligence and the laws of economics lend themselves to increased ethics or increased ethical behavior in the short term.

2:22:29.620 --> 2:22:42.620
 But what ends up happening is that in the long term, in order to scale economic benefits, you are forced to act within norms of your customer base.

2:22:42.620 --> 2:22:52.620
 So as the norms of that customer base dictate certain requirements, the company has to adapt to those requirements in order to continue to scale.

2:22:52.620 --> 2:23:04.620
 So if a company tries to ostracize LGBTQ or if they try to ostracize men or ostracize women, they're limiting their ability to grow economically.

2:23:04.620 --> 2:23:11.620
 They have to adapt to whatever is the prevailing ethical requirement of their customer base.

2:23:11.620 --> 2:23:22.620
 That's such an interesting question because you look at big pharma and pharmaceutical companies and they have quite a poor reputation in the public eye.

2:23:22.620 --> 2:23:28.620
 And some of it, maybe much of it is deserved, at least historically speaking.

2:23:28.620 --> 2:23:44.620
 And so you start to wonder, well, can intelligence agencies use some of the same technique to manipulate the public, like what they believe about those agencies in order to maximize profit as well?

2:23:44.620 --> 2:23:54.620
 Sort of finding shortcuts or unethical paths that allow you to not be ultimately responsible to the customer.

2:23:54.620 --> 2:23:55.620
 Absolutely.

2:23:55.620 --> 2:24:06.620
 And I would go a step further to say that the covert nature of intelligence operations is really attractive when it comes to the private sector.

2:24:06.620 --> 2:24:13.620
 Because now they have all the same money with none of the oversight and all they have to do is deliver.

2:24:13.620 --> 2:24:17.620
 So without the oversight, what's holding you back?

2:24:17.620 --> 2:24:23.620
 And for anybody who's ever run a business, anybody who's ever started a startup or tried to make something succeed,

2:24:23.620 --> 2:24:36.620
 we all know that there come those times where you have to skirt the boundaries of propriety or morality or commitments or promises to other people.

2:24:36.620 --> 2:24:40.620
 Because at the end of the day, if your business fails, it's on you.

2:24:40.620 --> 2:24:45.620
 So if you promise to deliver something to a client, you've got to deliver it to the client.

2:24:45.620 --> 2:24:52.620
 Even if that means you stay up late or if you lie on your taxes, whatever it might be, there's a certain level of do or die.

2:24:52.620 --> 2:25:02.620
 Yeah, I personally have a sort of optimistic view that ultimately the best way is to stay within ethical bounds, kind of like what you suggested.

2:25:02.620 --> 2:25:09.620
 If you want to be a company that's extremely successful is win with competence, not with cheating.

2:25:09.620 --> 2:25:14.620
 Because cheating won't, I believe, win in the long term.

2:25:14.620 --> 2:25:26.620
 But in terms of being publicly responsible to your decisions, I mean, I've already been supposed to talk to Peter Thiel twice on this podcast,

2:25:26.620 --> 2:25:28.620
 and it's just been complicated.

2:25:28.620 --> 2:25:34.620
 If I were to put myself into shoes, why do podcasts?

2:25:34.620 --> 2:25:39.620
 The risk is too high to be a public person at all.

2:25:39.620 --> 2:25:53.620
 And so I totally understand that at the same time, I think if you're doing things by the book and you're the best in the world at your job,

2:25:53.620 --> 2:25:56.620
 then you have nothing to worry about.

2:25:56.620 --> 2:25:59.620
 And you can advertise that and you help recruit.

2:25:59.620 --> 2:26:09.620
 I mean, that's the work of capitalism is you want to advertise that this is the place where the best people in the world at this thing work.

2:26:09.620 --> 2:26:10.620
 True.

2:26:10.620 --> 2:26:13.620
 I think that your point of view is accurate.

2:26:13.620 --> 2:26:25.620
 I would also say that the complexities of what makes somebody make a decision can only really be properly calculated with a baseline.

2:26:25.620 --> 2:26:34.620
 So because there is no baseline that you or I have on Peter Thiel, it's difficult to really ascertain why he does or doesn't accept invites or why he does or doesn't appear.

2:26:34.620 --> 2:26:40.620
 Well, let me ask your opinion on the NSA.

2:26:40.620 --> 2:26:50.620
 And then maybe you can mention about bulk connection and collection in general in the CIA, but let's look at some history with the NSA and Snowden.

2:26:50.620 --> 2:27:01.620
 What's your opinion on the mass surveillance that is reported to have been conducted by the NSA?

2:27:01.620 --> 2:27:03.620
 We talked about ethics.

2:27:03.620 --> 2:27:18.620
 Are you troubled by the from a public perception, the unethical nature of mass surveillance of especially American citizens?

2:27:18.620 --> 2:27:27.620
 This is a topic that I never get tired of talking about, but it's very rare that anyone ever really agrees with me, just so you know.

2:27:27.620 --> 2:27:32.620
 I think there's a nuance thing here, maybe we'll find some agreement.

2:27:32.620 --> 2:27:40.620
 The truth is that the American experience after 9 11 is nothing like the American experience now.

2:27:40.620 --> 2:27:50.620
 So all the terminology, all the talk about privacy and privacy laws and mass surveillance and all this other stuff, it was a completely different time then.

2:27:50.620 --> 2:28:06.620
 And that's not to say it was an excuse because to this day, I will still say mass, mass collection, bulk collection of data that allows for an expedient identification of a threat to national security benefits all of us.

2:28:06.620 --> 2:28:12.620
 But people don't understand what they want, like people don't understand what the value of their own privacy is.

2:28:12.620 --> 2:28:16.620
 First of all, the fact that people think they have personal privacy is laughable.

2:28:16.620 --> 2:28:18.620
 You have no privacy.

2:28:18.620 --> 2:28:22.620
 The cell phone that you carry in your pocket, you're giving permission to those apps constantly.

2:28:22.620 --> 2:28:28.620
 You're giving commercial organizations, what you and I have already said are less tied to ethical responsibility.

2:28:28.620 --> 2:28:34.620
 You're giving them permission to collect enormous amounts of private data from you all the time.

2:28:34.620 --> 2:28:40.620
 You know what happens if AT&T or Verizon sees some nefarious activity on your account?

2:28:40.620 --> 2:28:42.620
 They do nothing.

2:28:42.620 --> 2:28:46.620
 They might send a note to FBI because they have to according to some checklist.

2:28:46.620 --> 2:28:56.620
 But when NSA was collecting intelligence on metadata from around the United States, they were very specifically looking for terrorist threats that would harm American lives.

2:28:56.620 --> 2:29:04.620
 Man, NSA can clone my phone. I will give them my children's phone. I will give them the passwords to every one of my accounts.

2:29:04.620 --> 2:29:12.620
 If it means that there's a likelihood that my family will be safer from a nefarious actor whose intent on hurting us.

2:29:12.620 --> 2:29:16.620
 NSA doesn't care about your affair. NSA doesn't care if you're cheating on your taxes.

2:29:16.620 --> 2:29:22.620
 NSA doesn't care if you talk shit about your boss or if you hate the US president.

2:29:22.620 --> 2:29:24.620
 Nobody cares about that.

2:29:24.620 --> 2:29:31.620
 Your intelligence community is there to find threats to national security. That's what they're there to do.

2:29:31.620 --> 2:29:46.620
 What Snowden did when he outed that whole program, the fact that the court, the justice system, the civilian justice system went back and essentially overruled the ruling of the intelligence courts before them,

2:29:46.620 --> 2:29:55.620
 just goes to show how the general mass community really shouldn't have a say in what happens in the intelligence community.

2:29:55.620 --> 2:30:03.620
 They really shouldn't. You have politicians and you have the opportunity to elect people to a position and then you trust them.

2:30:03.620 --> 2:30:08.620
 That's what a representative republic is. You vote the people in. You trust them to work on your behalf.

2:30:08.620 --> 2:30:20.620
 They make decisions without running them by you. They make decisions that they believe are in the best interest of their constituency and that's how our form of democracy works.

2:30:20.620 --> 2:30:32.620
 It worked. We were safer now that we don't have that information and now that there's this giant looming question of whether or not NSA is there to serve people or is collecting mass surveillance against all American people.

2:30:32.620 --> 2:30:44.620
 That's not really a true accurate representation of what they were ever doing. They were looking for the needle in a haystack of the series of transactions in metadata that was going to lead to American deaths.

2:30:44.620 --> 2:30:49.620
 We are now less secure because they can't do that and that bothers me.

2:30:49.620 --> 2:31:05.620
 So you said a few really interesting things there. So because you are kind of an insider war for time and insider meaning you were able to build up an intuition about the good, the bad and the ugly of these institutions.

2:31:05.620 --> 2:31:13.620
 Specifically the good. A lot of people don't have a good sense of the good. They know the bad and the ugly or can infer the bad and the ugly.

2:31:13.620 --> 2:31:25.620
 You mentioned that the one little key little thing there at the end saying the NSA doesn't care about whether you hate the president or not.

2:31:25.620 --> 2:31:45.620
 Now that's what people really worry about is they're not sure they can trust the government to not go into full dictatorial mode and and based on your political preference, your oppositions, your basically one of the essential powers.

2:31:45.620 --> 2:31:49.620
 The freedom of speech in the United States is ability to criticize your government.

2:31:49.620 --> 2:31:50.620
 Exactly.

2:31:50.620 --> 2:31:59.620
 And that they worry while can't the government get a hold of the NSA and start to ask the basic question.

2:31:59.620 --> 2:32:03.620
 Well, can you give me a list of people that are criticizing the government?

2:32:03.620 --> 2:32:10.620
 Think about, so let's just walk through that exact example, right? Because this is, it's a preponderous, it's a preponderous fear.

2:32:10.620 --> 2:32:16.620
 It's a ridiculous fear because of you would have to tap on multiple elements of government for anything to happen.

2:32:16.620 --> 2:32:25.620
 So for example, let's just say that somebody goes to the NSA and says, hey, can you give us a readout on all the people who are tweeting terrible things about the president?

2:32:25.620 --> 2:32:26.620
 Okay, cool.

2:32:26.620 --> 2:32:29.620
 Here's your hundred million people, whatever it is, right?

2:32:29.620 --> 2:32:31.620
 Here's all the people saying negative things about the government.

2:32:31.620 --> 2:32:33.620
 So now they have a list.

2:32:33.620 --> 2:32:34.620
 What do they do next?

2:32:34.620 --> 2:32:36.620
 Well, let's just make it simple.

2:32:36.620 --> 2:32:41.620
 They stay with NSA and they say, surveil them even more, tap their phones, tap their computers.

2:32:41.620 --> 2:32:42.620
 I want to know even more.

2:32:42.620 --> 2:32:45.620
 So then they get this preponderance of evidence.

2:32:45.620 --> 2:32:47.620
 What do you do with evidence?

2:32:47.620 --> 2:32:49.620
 You take it to a court.

2:32:49.620 --> 2:32:50.620
 Well, guess what?

2:32:50.620 --> 2:32:56.620
 No court is going to support anything that goes against the freedom of speech.

2:32:56.620 --> 2:33:00.620
 So the court is not going to support what the executive is asking them to do.

2:33:00.620 --> 2:33:04.620
 Even before you take somebody to court, you have to involve law enforcement.

2:33:04.620 --> 2:33:10.620
 Essentially, you have to send some sort of police force to go apprehend the individual who's in question.

2:33:10.620 --> 2:33:16.620
 Well, guess what doesn't meet criteria for any police force anywhere in the United States?

2:33:16.620 --> 2:33:21.620
 Arresting people who say negative things about the president.

2:33:21.620 --> 2:33:27.620
 Now, if somebody poses a threat to the life of a public figure or the threat to life of a politician,

2:33:27.620 --> 2:33:32.620
 that's a completely different case, which means the standards of evidence are much higher for them to arrest that person.

2:33:32.620 --> 2:33:38.620
 So unless you create a secret police force, then your actual public police force is never going to take action.

2:33:38.620 --> 2:33:42.620
 So all these people who are afraid of this exact situation that you're outlying,

2:33:42.620 --> 2:33:49.620
 they need the creation of a secret police force, the creation of a secret court that operates outside the judicial system,

2:33:49.620 --> 2:33:54.620
 the creation of a secret intelligence service that operates outside of foreign intelligence collection,

2:33:54.620 --> 2:34:02.620
 all so that a handful of people who don't like the president get what, whisked away, assassinated, put in prison.

2:34:02.620 --> 2:34:03.620
 Who knows what?

2:34:03.620 --> 2:34:10.620
 Think about the resources that would be the amount of money and time and how hard would it be to keep that secret,

2:34:10.620 --> 2:34:12.620
 to have all of those things in motion?

2:34:12.620 --> 2:34:20.620
 The reason it worked in Russia and Soviet Germany or Russia and Communist Germany was because everybody knew there was a secret police.

2:34:20.620 --> 2:34:25.620
 Everybody knew that there was a threat to work to speaking out against the government.

2:34:25.620 --> 2:34:26.620
 It's completely different here.

2:34:26.620 --> 2:34:28.620
 Well, there's a lot to say.

2:34:28.620 --> 2:34:37.620
 So one is yes, if I was a dictator and I wanted to, and just looking at history, let me take myself out of it.

2:34:37.620 --> 2:34:42.620
 But I think one of the more effective ways is you don't need the surveillance.

2:34:42.620 --> 2:34:49.620
 You can pick out a random person and in a public display, semi public display,

2:34:49.620 --> 2:34:55.620
 basically put them in jail for opposing the government, whether they oppose it or not.

2:34:55.620 --> 2:34:59.620
 And the fear, that sends a message to a lot of people.

2:34:59.620 --> 2:35:01.620
 That's exactly what you see happening in China.

2:35:01.620 --> 2:35:03.620
 That's what you just light out.

2:35:03.620 --> 2:35:04.620
 It's genius.

2:35:04.620 --> 2:35:06.620
 And that is the standard.

2:35:06.620 --> 2:35:08.620
 You don't need the surveillance for that.

2:35:08.620 --> 2:35:17.620
 But that said, if you did do the surveillance, so that's the support, the sort of the incentives aren't aligned.

2:35:17.620 --> 2:35:21.620
 It seems like a lot of work to do for the thing you could do without the surveillance.

2:35:21.620 --> 2:35:31.620
 But yes, the courts wouldn't, if you were to be able to get a list of people, which I think that part you could do.

2:35:31.620 --> 2:35:32.620
 Correct.

2:35:32.620 --> 2:35:34.620
 That oppose the government.

2:35:34.620 --> 2:35:37.620
 You could do that just like you said on Twitter publicly.

2:35:37.620 --> 2:35:38.620
 You could make a list.

2:35:38.620 --> 2:35:46.620
 And with that, you can start to, especially if you have a lot of data on those people, find ways in which they did violate the law.

2:35:46.620 --> 2:35:50.620
 Not because they oppose the government, but because in some other way.

2:35:50.620 --> 2:35:53.620
 Like parking tickets or didn't pay the taxes.

2:35:53.620 --> 2:35:57.620
 That's probably a common one or like screwed up something about the taxes.

2:35:57.620 --> 2:36:02.620
 I just happen to know Russia and Ukraine, they're very good at this kind of stuff.

2:36:02.620 --> 2:36:10.620
 Knowing how the citizens screwed everything up, because especially in those countries, everybody's breaking the law.

2:36:10.620 --> 2:36:15.620
 Because in a corrupt nation, you have to bend the law to operate the law.

2:36:15.620 --> 2:36:22.620
 The number of people that pay taxes fully in those nations is just very low, not zero.

2:36:22.620 --> 2:36:30.620
 And so they then use that breaking of the law to come up with an excuse to actually put you in jail based on that.

2:36:30.620 --> 2:36:39.620
 So it's possible to imagine, but yes, I think that's the ugly part of surveillance.

2:36:39.620 --> 2:36:43.620
 But I do think, just like you said, the incentives aren't correct.

2:36:43.620 --> 2:36:49.620
 You really don't need to get all of the secret police and all of these kinds of organizations working.

2:36:49.620 --> 2:37:01.620
 If you do have a charismatic, powerful leader that built up a network that's able to control a lot of organizations to level of authoritarianism in a government,

2:37:01.620 --> 2:37:03.620
 they're just able to do the usual thing.

2:37:03.620 --> 2:37:16.620
 One, have propaganda machine to tell narratives to pick out people that they can put in jail for opposing the state and maybe loud members of the press start silencing the press.

2:37:16.620 --> 2:37:20.620
 There's a playbook to this thing, and it doesn't require the surveillance.

2:37:20.620 --> 2:37:35.620
 You know what is useful for the surveillance is the thing you mentioned in China, which is encourage everybody in the citizenry to watch each other,

2:37:35.620 --> 2:37:42.620
 to say there's enemies of the state everywhere, and then you start having children reporting on their parents and that kind of stuff.

2:37:42.620 --> 2:37:45.620
 Again, don't need a surveillance date for that.

2:37:45.620 --> 2:37:55.620
 Now, the good of a surveillance system, if it's operating within ethical bounds, is that yes, it could protect the populace.

2:37:55.620 --> 2:38:03.620
 So you're saying like the good, given on your understanding of these institutions, the good outweighs the bad.

2:38:03.620 --> 2:38:04.620
 Absolutely.

2:38:04.620 --> 2:38:06.620
 So let me give you just a practical example.

2:38:06.620 --> 2:38:10.620
 So people don't realize this, but there's multiple surveillance states that are out there.

2:38:10.620 --> 2:38:13.620
 There are surveillance states that are close allies with the United States.

2:38:13.620 --> 2:38:18.620
 One of those surveillance states is the United Arab Emirates, the UAE.

2:38:18.620 --> 2:38:28.620
 Now, I lived in the UAE from 2019 to 2020, came back on a repatriation flight after COVID broke out, but we were there for a full year.

2:38:28.620 --> 2:38:31.620
 We were residents, we had IDs, we had everything.

2:38:31.620 --> 2:38:39.620
 Now, when you get your national ID in the Emirates, you get a chip, and that chip connects you to everything.

2:38:39.620 --> 2:38:46.620
 It connects you to cameras, it connects you to your license plate on your car, to your passport, to your credit card, everything.

2:38:46.620 --> 2:38:48.620
 Everything is intertwined, everything is interlinked.

2:38:48.620 --> 2:38:50.620
 When you drive, there are no police.

2:38:50.620 --> 2:38:52.620
 There are no police on the roads.

2:38:52.620 --> 2:39:00.620
 Every 50 to 100 meters, you cross a camera that reads your license plate, measures your speed, and if you're breaking the speed limit,

2:39:00.620 --> 2:39:04.620
 it just immediately charges your credit card because it's tied, it's all tied together.

2:39:04.620 --> 2:39:05.620
 Totally surveillance.

2:39:05.620 --> 2:39:12.620
 That technology was invented by the Israelis who use it in Israel.

2:39:12.620 --> 2:39:22.620
 When I was in Abu Dhabi and I was rear ended at high speed by what turned out to be an Emirati official, a senior ranking official of one of the Emirates.

2:39:22.620 --> 2:39:31.620
 It was caught on camera, his ID was registered, my ID was registered, everything was tied back to our IDs, the proof and the evidence was crystal clear.

2:39:31.620 --> 2:39:35.620
 Even still, he was Emirati, I was not.

2:39:35.620 --> 2:39:41.620
 So when I went to the police station to file the complaint, it was something that nobody was comfortable with because generally speaking,

2:39:41.620 --> 2:39:46.620
 Emiratis don't accept legal claims against their own from foreigners.

2:39:46.620 --> 2:39:51.620
 But the difference was that I was an American and I was there on a contract supporting the Emirati government.

2:39:51.620 --> 2:39:54.620
 So I had these different variances, right?

2:39:54.620 --> 2:40:06.620
 Long story short, in the end, the surveillance state is what made sure that justice was played because the proof was incontrovertible.

2:40:06.620 --> 2:40:10.620
 There was so much evidence collected because of the surveillance nature of their state.

2:40:10.620 --> 2:40:12.620
 Now, why do they have a surveillance state?

2:40:12.620 --> 2:40:13.620
 It's not for people like me.

2:40:13.620 --> 2:40:27.620
 It's because they're constantly afraid of extremist terrorist activity happening inside Abu Dhabi or inside the UAE because they're under constant threat from Islam and they're from extremists and they're under constant threat from Iran.

2:40:27.620 --> 2:40:32.620
 So that's what drives the people to want a police state, to want a surveillance state.

2:40:32.620 --> 2:40:38.620
 For them, their survival is paramount and they need the surveillance to have that survival.

2:40:38.620 --> 2:40:42.620
 For us, we haven't tasted that level of desperation and fear.

2:40:42.620 --> 2:40:48.620
 Yet, or hopefully never, but that's what makes us feel like there's something wrong with surveillance.

2:40:48.620 --> 2:40:50.620
 Surveillance is all about the purpose.

2:40:50.620 --> 2:40:51.620
 It's all about the intent.

2:40:51.620 --> 2:41:00.620
 Well, and like you said, companies do a significant amount of surveillance to provide us with services that we take for granted.

2:41:00.620 --> 2:41:08.620
 For example, just one of the things to give props to the digital efforts of the Zelensky administration in Ukraine.

2:41:08.620 --> 2:41:25.620
 I don't know if you're aware, but they have this digital transformation efforts where you can put, like there's an, it's laughable to say in the United States, but they actually did a really good job of having a government app that has your passport on it.

2:41:25.620 --> 2:41:26.620
 It's all the digital information.

2:41:26.620 --> 2:41:28.620
 You can get a doctor.

2:41:28.620 --> 2:41:35.620
 It's like everything that you would think America would be doing, you know, like license, like all that kind of stuff.

2:41:35.620 --> 2:41:36.620
 It's in an app.

2:41:36.620 --> 2:41:39.620
 You could pay this payment to each other.

2:41:39.620 --> 2:41:40.620
 And that's all coming.

2:41:40.620 --> 2:41:46.620
 I mean, there's probably contractors somehow connected to the whole thing, but that's like under the flag of government.

2:41:46.620 --> 2:41:48.620
 And so that's an incredible technology.

2:41:48.620 --> 2:41:55.620
 And I didn't, I guess, hear anybody talk about surveillance in that context, even though it is, but they all love it.

2:41:55.620 --> 2:41:56.620
 And it's super easy.

2:41:56.620 --> 2:42:00.620
 And they frankly already, it's so easy and convenient.

2:42:00.620 --> 2:42:03.620
 They've already taken for granted that of course this is what you do.

2:42:03.620 --> 2:42:05.620
 Of course your passport is on your phone.

2:42:05.620 --> 2:42:09.620
 For everybody to have housed in a server that you have no idea where it's at.

2:42:09.620 --> 2:42:12.620
 That could be hacked at any time by a third party.

2:42:12.620 --> 2:42:26.620
 They don't ask these kinds of questions because it's so convenient as we do for Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Microsoft, products we use.

2:42:26.620 --> 2:42:29.620
 Security and convenience are on two opposite sides of another spectrum.

2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:35.620
 The more convenient something is, the less secure, and the more secure something is, the less convenient.

2:42:35.620 --> 2:42:42.620
 And that's a battle that we're always working with as individuals, and then we're trying to outsource that battle to our politicians.

2:42:42.620 --> 2:42:45.620
 And our politicians are frankly just more interested in being politicians.

2:42:45.620 --> 2:42:58.620
 Yeah, that said, I mean, people are really worried about giving any one institution a large amount of power, especially when it's a federal government institution.

2:42:58.620 --> 2:43:08.620
 Given some history, first of all, just history of the corruption of power corrupting individuals and institutions.

2:43:08.620 --> 2:43:16.620
 And second of all, myth or reality of certain institutions like the CIA misbehaving.

2:43:16.620 --> 2:43:19.620
 Well, let me actually ask you about the Edward Snowden.

2:43:19.620 --> 2:43:33.620
 So you, outside of the utility that you're arguing for of the NSA surveillance program, do you think Edward Snowden is a criminal or a hero?

2:43:33.620 --> 2:43:37.620
 In terms of the eyes of the law, he's a criminal.

2:43:37.620 --> 2:43:39.620
 He broke the law.

2:43:39.620 --> 2:43:40.620
 He broke the confidence.

2:43:40.620 --> 2:43:42.620
 He made us, he was under security obligation.

2:43:42.620 --> 2:43:52.620
 And then when he ran away, he ran away to all of the worst villains in the world from the US perspective to basically seek protection.

2:43:52.620 --> 2:44:02.620
 That's how you act in the face of accusation is in essence part of the case that you build for yourself.

2:44:02.620 --> 2:44:08.620
 So running away to China, Russia, Cuba, there was a Latin Ecuador, I think.

2:44:08.620 --> 2:44:15.620
 That just paints a very negative picture that does not suggest that you were doing anything that was ethical and upright and in favor of the American people.

2:44:15.620 --> 2:44:18.620
 If you're going to run to American enemies to support yourself.

2:44:18.620 --> 2:44:21.620
 So for sure, in the eyes of law, he's a criminal.

2:44:21.620 --> 2:44:31.620
 In the eyes of a group of people who are largely ignorant to what they lost to them, he's a hero.

2:44:31.620 --> 2:44:34.620
 To me, he's just kind of a sad case.

2:44:34.620 --> 2:44:40.620
 I personally look at Snowden as a sad, unfortunate case.

2:44:40.620 --> 2:44:42.620
 His life is ruined.

2:44:42.620 --> 2:44:45.620
 His family name is tarnished.

2:44:45.620 --> 2:44:51.620
 He's forever going to be a desperate pawn.

2:44:51.620 --> 2:44:54.620
 And that's all because of the decisions that he made and the order that he made them.

2:44:54.620 --> 2:44:56.620
 I'm not sure his name is tarnished.

2:44:56.620 --> 2:45:00.620
 I think the case you're making is a difficult case to make.

2:45:00.620 --> 2:45:07.620
 And so I think his name represents fighting one man.

2:45:07.620 --> 2:45:15.620
 It's like Tiananmen Square standing before the tank is like one man fighting the government.

2:45:15.620 --> 2:45:28.620
 And I think that there is some aspect to which taking that case aside, that is the American spirit, which is hold the powerful accountable.

2:45:28.620 --> 2:45:37.620
 So whenever there's somebody in power, one individual can change.

2:45:37.620 --> 2:45:39.620
 One man can make a difference.

2:45:39.620 --> 2:45:40.620
 Can make a difference, yeah.

2:45:40.620 --> 2:45:41.620
 Very night writer of you.

2:45:41.620 --> 2:45:44.620
 Well, I mean, that's the American individualism.

2:45:44.620 --> 2:45:46.620
 And so he represents that.

2:45:46.620 --> 2:45:52.620
 And I think there's a huge skepticism against large federal institutions.

2:45:52.620 --> 2:46:01.620
 And I think if you look at the long arc of history, that actually is a forcing function for the institutions to behave their best.

2:46:01.620 --> 2:46:06.620
 So basically hold them accountable.

2:46:06.620 --> 2:46:13.620
 If what's nice about this is that we can agree to disagree and history will be the one that decides.

2:46:13.620 --> 2:46:25.620
 But once like there's a reason that Edward Snowden needs to do something new every 16 or 18 months to remain relevant, right?

2:46:25.620 --> 2:46:32.620
 Because if he didn't, he would just be forgotten because he was not a maverick who changed history for the better.

2:46:32.620 --> 2:46:37.620
 He was a man who broke a law and now he's on the run.

2:46:37.620 --> 2:46:50.620
 And to some people, he is a hero to other people, he is a criminal, but to the vast majority, he's just a blip on a radar of their everyday life that really makes no difference to them at all.

2:46:50.620 --> 2:46:51.620
 So actually, let's linger on that.

2:46:51.620 --> 2:47:04.620
 So just to clarify, do you think are you making the difficult case that the NSA mass surveillance program was one ethical and two made a better world for Americans?

2:47:04.620 --> 2:47:12.620
 I am making the case that at the time it was exactly what we needed to feel safe in our own homes.

2:47:12.620 --> 2:47:15.620
 But what about to be safe, actually be safe?

2:47:15.620 --> 2:47:24.620
 So this is what's difficult because any proof that was that they collected that actually prevented an attack from happening is proof we'll never know about.

2:47:24.620 --> 2:47:28.620
 This is the really unfortunate side of intelligence operations.

2:47:28.620 --> 2:47:38.620
 And I've been at the front end of this, you work your ass off, you take personal risk, you make personal sacrifice to make sure that something terrible doesn't happen.

2:47:38.620 --> 2:47:40.620
 Nobody knows that that ever happened.

2:47:40.620 --> 2:47:42.620
 Does that have to be that way?

2:47:42.620 --> 2:47:51.620
 Does it have to remain secret every time the NSA or the CIA saves the lives of Americans?

2:47:51.620 --> 2:47:52.620
 It does for two reasons.

2:47:52.620 --> 2:47:53.620
 It has to be secret.

2:47:53.620 --> 2:47:58.620
 The mythos, the same thing we were talking about with General Petraeus.

2:47:58.620 --> 2:48:04.620
 You can't brag about your victories if you want to let the myth shape itself.

2:48:04.620 --> 2:48:05.620
 You can't do that.

2:48:05.620 --> 2:48:21.620
 The second thing is once a victory is claimed, the danger comes from letting your enemy know that you claimed the victory because they can reverse engineer and they can start to change how they did things.

2:48:21.620 --> 2:48:28.620
 If a terrorist act, if a terrorist cell tries to execute an operation and the operation fails, from their point of view, they don't know why it failed.

2:48:28.620 --> 2:48:29.620
 They just know that it failed.

2:48:29.620 --> 2:48:38.620
 But then if the US or if the American government comes in and says, we took apart this amazing attack, now they have more information.

2:48:38.620 --> 2:48:43.620
 The whole power of secrets, like we talked about before, the power of secrets is in knowing that not everybody has them.

2:48:43.620 --> 2:48:45.620
 There's only a shelf life.

2:48:45.620 --> 2:48:47.620
 So take advantage of the shelf life.

2:48:47.620 --> 2:48:50.620
 You get space, so you got to keep it a secret.

2:48:50.620 --> 2:49:04.620
 There is no tactical advantage from sharing a secret unless you are specifically trying to achieve a certain tactical advantage from sharing that secret, which is what we've seen so much of with US intel sharing with Ukraine.

2:49:04.620 --> 2:49:13.620
 There's a tactical advantage from sharing a secret about Russian military movements or weaknesses in tanks or supply chain challenges, whatever it might be.

2:49:13.620 --> 2:49:33.620
 Well, let me argue that there might be an advantage to share information with the American public when a terrorist attack is averted or the lives of Americans are saved because what that does is make every American think that they're not that safe.

2:49:33.620 --> 2:49:35.620
 There is no tactical advantage there.

2:49:35.620 --> 2:49:36.620
 You think so?

2:49:36.620 --> 2:49:37.620
 Absolutely.

2:49:37.620 --> 2:49:38.620
 What about?

2:49:38.620 --> 2:49:49.620
 If the Austin PD started telling you every day about these crazy crimes that they prevented, would that make you feel more safe?

2:49:49.620 --> 2:49:51.620
 It would make you feel like they're doing their job.

2:49:51.620 --> 2:49:53.620
 Is that obvious to you to make us feel less safe?

2:49:53.620 --> 2:50:04.620
 Because if we see competence, that there is extremely competent defenders of this territory, of these people, would that make us feel more safe or no?

2:50:04.620 --> 2:50:08.620
 The human nature is not to assign competence.

2:50:08.620 --> 2:50:16.620
 So empirically, humans overvalue losses and undervalue gains.

2:50:16.620 --> 2:50:20.620
 That's something that we've seen from finance to betting and beyond.

2:50:20.620 --> 2:50:32.620
 If the Austin Police Department starts telling you about all these heinous crimes that were avoided because of their hard work, the way that your brain is actually going to process that information is you are going to say,

2:50:32.620 --> 2:50:38.620
 if this is all the stuff that they've stopped, how bad must this place be?

2:50:38.620 --> 2:50:41.620
 How much more haven't they stopped?

2:50:41.620 --> 2:50:42.620
 I take your point.

2:50:42.620 --> 2:50:44.620
 It's a powerful psychological point.

2:50:44.620 --> 2:51:02.620
 But looking at the other picture of it, looking at the police force, looking at the CIA, the NSA, those people now with the police, they're such a negative feeling amongst Americans towards these institutions.

2:51:02.620 --> 2:51:07.620
 Who the hell wants to work for the CIA now and the police force?

2:51:07.620 --> 2:51:16.620
 You're going to be criticized. That's really bad for the CIA.

2:51:16.620 --> 2:51:17.620
 It's terrible.

2:51:17.620 --> 2:51:20.620
 As opposed to being seen as a hero.

2:51:20.620 --> 2:51:32.620
 For example, currently, soldiers are, for the most part, seen as heroes that are protecting this nation. That's not the case for the CIA.

2:51:32.620 --> 2:51:36.620
 Soldiers weren't seen as heroes in the Vietnam War.

2:51:36.620 --> 2:51:43.620
 You've got to remember that when you, so first of all, public service is a sacrifice.

2:51:43.620 --> 2:51:45.620
 We oftentimes forget that.

2:51:45.620 --> 2:51:52.620
 We start to think, oh, government jobs are cushy and they're easy, and it must be so easy to be the president because then you're basically a celebrity overnight.

2:51:52.620 --> 2:51:55.620
 Public service is a sacrifice.

2:51:55.620 --> 2:51:57.620
 It's a grind.

2:51:57.620 --> 2:52:14.620
 For all of the soldiers, the submariners, the misiliers, the police officers, intelligence specialists, they all know what it's like to give things up, to serve a public that can turn its opinion at any given time.

2:52:14.620 --> 2:52:16.620
 And history is what defines it.

2:52:16.620 --> 2:52:24.620
 The more important thing is to understand that if you want a true open and fair democracy, you cannot control a narrative.

2:52:24.620 --> 2:52:44.620
 And starting to share all of your victories or starting to share your biggest victories with the intent of shaping public opinion to be supportive of the police force or supportive of CIA or supportive of, you name it, is shaping a narrative that is intentional operational use of influence to drive public opinion.

2:52:44.620 --> 2:52:47.620
 That is something nobody wants to get into.

2:52:47.620 --> 2:52:58.620
 It is much more professional to be a silent sentinel, a silent servant, humbly carrying the burden of public service in the United States where we are a fair and open democracy.

2:52:58.620 --> 2:53:00.620
 Why?

2:53:00.620 --> 2:53:04.620
 Why not celebrate the killing of Bin Laden?

2:53:04.620 --> 2:53:05.620
 We did.

2:53:05.620 --> 2:53:08.620
 The search, discovery and the capture and the killing of Bin Laden.

2:53:08.620 --> 2:53:10.620
 Wasn't that actually the details of that?

2:53:10.620 --> 2:53:15.620
 How much of the details of that, how he was discovered, were made public?

2:53:15.620 --> 2:53:17.620
 I think some of it was made public enough.

2:53:17.620 --> 2:53:18.620
 Why not do that?

2:53:18.620 --> 2:53:23.620
 Doesn't that make heroes out of the people that are servants?

2:53:23.620 --> 2:53:28.620
 Or do people who serve do do service for this nation?

2:53:28.620 --> 2:53:34.620
 Do they always have to operate in a thankless manner in the shadows?

2:53:34.620 --> 2:53:36.620
 I think that's a very good question.

2:53:36.620 --> 2:53:51.620
 The folks who I left behind, when I left CIA, who continue to serve as faceless, nameless heroes every day, I am grateful to them.

2:53:51.620 --> 2:53:59.620
 The truth is that if they were motivated by something else, they wouldn't be as good as they are at doing what they do.

2:53:59.620 --> 2:54:06.620
 And I see your point about shouldn't we be celebrating our victories?

2:54:06.620 --> 2:54:23.620
 But when celebrating our victories runs the risk of informing our enemies how we operate, giving away our informational advantage, giving away our tactical battlefield advantage, and running the risk of shaping a narrative intentionally among our own American people.

2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:30.620
 Now all of a sudden we're turning into exactly the thing that the American people trust us not to become.

2:54:30.620 --> 2:54:38.620
 Yeah, but then you operate in the secrecy and then there's corrupt and douchebag people everywhere.

2:54:38.620 --> 2:54:49.620
 So when they, even inside the CIA and criminals, inside the CIA, there's criminals in all organizations, in all walks of life, human nature is such that this is always the case.

2:54:49.620 --> 2:54:52.620
 Then it breeds conspiracy theories.

2:54:52.620 --> 2:54:54.620
 It does.

2:54:54.620 --> 2:54:59.620
 And sometimes those conspiracy theories turn out to be true, but most times they don't.

2:54:59.620 --> 2:55:03.620
 That's just part of the risk of being a myth.

2:55:03.620 --> 2:55:05.620
 Can you speak to some of the myths?

2:55:05.620 --> 2:55:07.620
 So MKUltra.

2:55:07.620 --> 2:55:08.620
 So.

2:55:08.620 --> 2:55:09.620
 Not a myth.

2:55:09.620 --> 2:55:10.620
 Not a myth.

2:55:10.620 --> 2:55:21.620
 So this is a fascinating human experimentation program undertaken by the CIA to develop procedures for using drugs like LSD to interrogate people through,

2:55:21.620 --> 2:55:25.620
 let's say, psychological manipulation and maybe even torture.

2:55:25.620 --> 2:55:28.620
 The scale of the program is perhaps not known.

2:55:28.620 --> 2:55:31.620
 How do you make sense that this program existed?

2:55:31.620 --> 2:55:33.620
 Again, you've got to look through the lens of time.

2:55:33.620 --> 2:55:35.620
 You've got to look at where we were historically at that time.

2:55:35.620 --> 2:55:37.620
 There was the peak of the Cold War.

2:55:37.620 --> 2:55:41.620
 Our enemies were doing the same kind of experimentation.

2:55:41.620 --> 2:55:43.620
 It was essentially another space race.

2:55:43.620 --> 2:55:52.620
 What if they broke through a new weapon technology faster than we did?

2:55:52.620 --> 2:55:54.620
 What would that mean for the safety and security of the American people?

2:55:54.620 --> 2:56:01.620
 So right decision or wrong decision, it was guided by and informed by national security priorities.

2:56:01.620 --> 2:56:10.620
 So from this program that was designed to use drugs to drive interrogation and torture people was born something very productive,

2:56:10.620 --> 2:56:18.620
 Operation Stargate, which was a chance to use remote viewing and metaphysics to try to collect intelligence.

2:56:18.620 --> 2:56:27.620
 Now, even though in the end, the outcome of MK Ultra and the outcome of Stargate were mixed, nobody really knows if they did or didn't do what they were supposed to do.

2:56:27.620 --> 2:56:38.620
 We still know that to this day, there's still a demand in the US government and in CIA for people who have sensitivities to ethereal energies.

2:56:38.620 --> 2:56:42.620
 By the way, is there any proof that that kind of stuff works?

2:56:42.620 --> 2:56:46.620
 It just shows that there's interest.

2:56:46.620 --> 2:56:49.620
 It shows that there's openness to consider those kinds of things.

2:56:49.620 --> 2:56:51.620
 But is there any evidence that that kind of stuff works?

2:56:51.620 --> 2:56:54.620
 If there's evidence, I haven't seen it.

2:56:54.620 --> 2:57:13.620
 Speaking from a science based point of view only, if energy and matter can always be exchanged, then a person who can understand and become sensitive to energy is a person who could become sensitive to what does become matter.

2:57:13.620 --> 2:57:14.620
 Yeah.

2:57:14.620 --> 2:57:19.620
 I mean, the basics of the physics might be there, but a lot of people probably are skeptical.

2:57:19.620 --> 2:57:20.620
 I'm skeptical too.

2:57:20.620 --> 2:57:22.620
 But you should be open minded.

2:57:22.620 --> 2:57:33.620
 That's what science is about is remain open minded even for the things that are long shots because those are the things that actually define scientific revolutions.

2:57:33.620 --> 2:57:36.620
 What about Operation Northwoods?

2:57:36.620 --> 2:57:51.620
 It was a proposed 1962 false flag operation by the DOD and the CIA to be carried out by the CIA to commit acts of terrorism on Americans and blame them on Cuba.

2:57:51.620 --> 2:57:54.620
 So JFK, the president rejected the proposal.

2:57:54.620 --> 2:57:58.620
 What do you make that this was on the table Operation Northwoods?

2:57:58.620 --> 2:58:00.620
 So it's interesting.

2:58:00.620 --> 2:58:02.620
 First, I'm glad that JFK rejected it.

2:58:02.620 --> 2:58:04.620
 That's a good sign.

2:58:04.620 --> 2:58:11.620
 So we have to understand that good ideas are oftentimes born from bad ideas.

2:58:11.620 --> 2:58:19.620
 I had a really good friend of mine who actually went on to become a pastor and he used to say all the time that he wanted all the bad ideas on the table.

2:58:19.620 --> 2:58:23.620
 Like, give me all your bad ideas every time we had any kind of conversation.

2:58:23.620 --> 2:58:27.620
 And I was always one of those people who was like, isn't a bad idea just a waste of time?

2:58:27.620 --> 2:58:31.620
 And he was like, no, because the best ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas.

2:58:31.620 --> 2:58:42.620
 So again, Cuban Missile Crisis, mass hysteria in the United States about nuclear war from Cuba, missiles blowing up American cities faster than we could even see them coming.

2:58:42.620 --> 2:58:50.620
 It makes sense to me that a president would go to especially the part of CIA, which is the Special Activities Division.

2:58:50.620 --> 2:59:03.620
 It makes perfect sense to me that the president would go to a division called Special Activities, whose job it is to create, you know, crazy ideas that have presidential approval, but nobody knows they exist.

2:59:03.620 --> 2:59:08.620
 So it makes sense that he would challenge a group like that to come up with any wacky idea, right?

2:59:08.620 --> 2:59:09.620
 Come up with anything.

2:59:09.620 --> 2:59:13.620
 Just let's start with something because we can't have, we can't bring nothing to the table.

2:59:13.620 --> 2:59:15.620
 We have to do something about this Cuban issue.

2:59:15.620 --> 2:59:18.620
 And then that's how an operation like that could reasonably be born.

2:59:18.620 --> 2:59:24.620
 Not because anybody wants to do it, but because they were tasked by the president to come up with five ideas.

2:59:24.620 --> 2:59:28.620
 And it was one of the ideas that still happens to this day.

2:59:28.620 --> 2:59:34.620
 The president will still come in, but it'll basically send out a notice to his covert action arm.

2:59:34.620 --> 2:59:39.620
 And he will say, I need this and I need it on Wednesday.

2:59:39.620 --> 2:59:44.620
 And people have to come back with options for the thing he asked for, a finding.

2:59:44.620 --> 2:59:46.620
 He will issue a presidential finding.

2:59:46.620 --> 2:59:52.620
 And then his covert action arms have to come back and say, here's how we would do this and hide the hands of the Americans.

2:59:52.620 --> 2:59:55.620
 How gangster was it of JFK to eject it though?

2:59:55.620 --> 2:59:57.620
 His baller, right?

2:59:57.620 --> 2:59:59.620
 That's like, that is a mic drop right there.

2:59:59.620 --> 3:00:01.620
 Nope, not doing that.

3:00:01.620 --> 3:00:03.620
 Yep, doing that.

3:00:03.620 --> 3:00:15.620
 A thing that crosses an ethical line, even in a time where the human, the entirety of human civilization hangs in a balance, still forfeit that power.

3:00:15.620 --> 3:00:20.620
 That's a beautiful thing about the American experiment.

3:00:20.620 --> 3:00:27.620
 That's a few times throughout this history that's just happened, including with our first president, George Washington.

3:00:27.620 --> 3:00:31.620
 Well, let me ask about JFK.

3:00:31.620 --> 3:00:37.620
 25 times two, and they still keep that stuff classified.

3:00:37.620 --> 3:00:45.620
 So do you think the CIA had a hand in the assassination of JFK?

3:00:45.620 --> 3:00:54.620
 I cannot imagine, in any reasonable point of view, that the organization of CIA had anything to do with the assassination of JFK.

3:00:54.620 --> 3:01:08.620
 So it's not possible to infiltrate the CIA, a small part of the CIA, in order to attain political or criminal gains?

3:01:08.620 --> 3:01:09.620
 I think.

3:01:09.620 --> 3:01:10.620
 Or financial.

3:01:10.620 --> 3:01:13.620
 Yeah, absolutely it's possible to infiltrate CIA.

3:01:13.620 --> 3:01:22.620
 There's a long history of foreign intelligence services infiltrating CIA, from Aldrich Ames to Jerry Lee recently with China.

3:01:22.620 --> 3:01:26.620
 So we know CIA can be infiltrated.

3:01:26.620 --> 3:01:44.620
 Even if they are infiltrated, and even if that interlocutor executes on their own agenda, or the agenda as directed by their foreign adversary, their foreign handler, that's different than organizational support for an event.

3:01:44.620 --> 3:01:58.620
 So I do think it's possible they could have been infiltrated at the time, especially, it was a major priority for the Cubans and the Russians to infiltrate some aspect of US intelligence.

3:01:58.620 --> 3:02:02.620
 Multiple moles were caught in the years following.

3:02:02.620 --> 3:02:16.620
 So it's not surprising that there would be a priority for that, but to say that the organization of CIA was somehow in cahoots with to independently assassinate their own executive, that's a significant stretch.

3:02:16.620 --> 3:02:23.620
 I've seen no evidence to support that, and it goes contrary to everything I learned from my time at CIA.

3:02:23.620 --> 3:02:37.620
 Well, let me ask you, do you think CIA played a part in enabling drug cartels and drug trafficking, which is another big kind of shadow that hangs over the CIA?

3:02:37.620 --> 3:02:41.620
 At the beginning of the drug war, I would imagine the answer is yes.

3:02:41.620 --> 3:02:50.620
 CIA has its own counter narcotics division, a division that's dedicated to fighting and preventing narcotics from coming into the United States.

3:02:50.620 --> 3:02:59.620
 So when you paint a picture for me, like do you think the CIA was complicit in helping drug trafficking or drug use?

3:02:59.620 --> 3:03:05.620
 When I say yes, my exception is I don't think they did that for Americans inside the United States.

3:03:05.620 --> 3:03:17.620
 If the CIA can basically set it up so that two different drug cartels shoot each other by assisting in the transaction of a sale to a third country,

3:03:17.620 --> 3:03:25.620
 and then leaking that that sale happened to a competing cartel, that's just letting cartels do what they do, that's them doing the dirty work for us.

3:03:25.620 --> 3:03:33.620
 So especially at the beginning of the drug war, I think there was tons of space, lots of room for CIA to get involved in the economics of drugs,

3:03:33.620 --> 3:03:35.620
 and then let the inevitable happen.

3:03:35.620 --> 3:03:43.620
 And that was way more efficient, way more productive than us trying to send our own troops in to kill a bunch of cartel warlords.

3:03:43.620 --> 3:03:46.620
 So that makes a ton of sense to me, it just seems efficient, it seems very practical.

3:03:46.620 --> 3:03:54.620
 I do not believe that CIA would like, I don't think all the accusations out there about how they would buy drugs and sell drugs and somehow make money on the side from it.

3:03:54.620 --> 3:03:56.620
 That's not how it works.

3:03:56.620 --> 3:04:06.620
 So do you think there's, on that point, a connection between Barry Seal, the great governor, and then President Bill Clinton, Oliver North,

3:04:06.620 --> 3:04:14.620
 and Vice President and former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, and a little town with a little airport called Mina, Arkansas.

3:04:14.620 --> 3:04:16.620
 So I am out of my element now.

3:04:16.620 --> 3:04:19.620
 This is what I haven't heard money details about.

3:04:19.620 --> 3:04:20.620
 Okay.

3:04:20.620 --> 3:04:34.620
 So your sense is any of the drug trafficking has to do with criminal operations outside of the United States and the CIA just leveraging that to achieve its ends,

3:04:34.620 --> 3:04:38.620
 but nothing to do with American citizens and American politicians.

3:04:38.620 --> 3:04:42.620
 With American citizens, again, speaking organizationally.

3:04:42.620 --> 3:04:46.620
 So that would be my sense, yes.

3:04:46.620 --> 3:05:04.620
 Let me ask you about, so back to Operation Northwood's because it's such a powerful tool, sadly powerful tool used by dictators throughout history, the false flag operation.

3:05:04.620 --> 3:05:18.620
 So I think there's, and you said the terrorist attacks in 911 were changed a lot for us, for the United States, for Americans.

3:05:18.620 --> 3:05:22.620
 It changed the way we see the world to woke us up to the harshness of the world.

3:05:22.620 --> 3:05:30.620
 I think there's, to my eyes at least, there's nothing that shows evidence that 911 was a quote inside job.

3:05:30.620 --> 3:05:40.620
 But is the CIA or the intelligence agencies or the US government capable of something like that?

3:05:40.620 --> 3:05:42.620
 But that's the question.

3:05:42.620 --> 3:05:44.620
 I guess, yeah.

3:05:44.620 --> 3:05:48.620
 There's a bunch of shadiness about how it was reported on.

3:05:48.620 --> 3:05:52.620
 I just can't, that's the thing I struggle with.

3:05:52.620 --> 3:05:58.620
 While there's no evidence that there was an inside job, it raises the question to me.

3:05:58.620 --> 3:06:02.620
 Well, could something like this be an inside job?

3:06:02.620 --> 3:06:22.620
 Because it sure as heck, now looking back 20 years, the amount of money that was spent on these wars, the military industrial complex, the amount of interest in terms of power and money involved, organizationally, can something like that happen?

3:06:22.620 --> 3:06:32.620
 You know Occam's razor, so the Herum's razor, is that you can never prescribe to conspiracy what could be explained through incompetence.

3:06:32.620 --> 3:06:38.620
 Those are two fundamental guidelines that we follow all the time.

3:06:38.620 --> 3:06:44.620
 The simplest answer is oftentimes the best and never prescribe to conspiracy what can be explained through incompetence.

3:06:44.620 --> 3:06:46.620
 Can you elaborate what you mean by we?

3:06:46.620 --> 3:06:50.620
 We as intelligence professionals.

3:06:50.620 --> 3:06:54.620
 Do you think there's a deep truth to that second razor?

3:06:54.620 --> 3:06:58.620
 There is more than a deep truth.

3:06:58.620 --> 3:07:02.620
 There's ages of experience for me and for others.

3:07:02.620 --> 3:07:04.620
 So in general, people are incompetent.

3:07:04.620 --> 3:07:12.620
 If left to their own means, they're more incompetent than they are malevolent at a large organizational scale.

3:07:12.620 --> 3:07:24.620
 People are more incompetent of executing a conspiracy than they are of competently executing a conspiracy.

3:07:24.620 --> 3:07:32.620
 That's really what it means is that it's so difficult to carry out a complex lie that most people don't have the competency to do it.

3:07:32.620 --> 3:07:36.620
 So it doesn't make any sense to lead thinking of conspiracy.

3:07:36.620 --> 3:07:40.620
 It makes more sense to lead assuming incompetence.

3:07:40.620 --> 3:07:44.620
 If you look at all of the outcomes, all the findings from 9.11, it speaks to incompetence.

3:07:44.620 --> 3:07:50.620
 It speaks brashly and openly to incompetence and nobody likes talking about it.

3:07:50.620 --> 3:07:53.620
 FBI and CIA to this day hate hearing about it.

3:07:53.620 --> 3:08:00.620
 The 9.11 commission is going to go down in history as this painful example of the incompetence of the American intelligence intelligence community.

3:08:00.620 --> 3:08:02.620
 And it's going to come back again and again.

3:08:02.620 --> 3:08:06.620
 Every time there's an intel flap, it's going to come back again and again.

3:08:06.620 --> 3:08:08.620
 What are you seeing even right now?

3:08:08.620 --> 3:08:11.620
 We miss the U.S. intelligence infrastructure.

3:08:11.620 --> 3:08:13.620
 Misjudged Afghanistan.

3:08:13.620 --> 3:08:15.620
 Misjudged Hong Kong.

3:08:15.620 --> 3:08:19.620
 Misjudged Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

3:08:19.620 --> 3:08:23.620
 Those were three massive misjudgments in a few years.

3:08:23.620 --> 3:08:25.620
 It's just embarrassing to think.

3:08:25.620 --> 3:08:27.620
 It's just embarrassing.

3:08:27.620 --> 3:08:28.620
 Exactly right.

3:08:28.620 --> 3:08:36.620
 So all the sort of cover up looking things around 9.11 is just people being embarrassed by their failures.

3:08:36.620 --> 3:08:45.620
 If they're taking steps to cover anything up, it's just their own, it's a painful reminder of their lack of competency at the time.

3:08:45.620 --> 3:08:55.620
 Now, I understand that conspiracy theorists want to take inklings of information and put them together in a way that is the most damning,

3:08:55.620 --> 3:09:00.620
 but that goes back to our point about overvaluing losses and undervaluing gains.

3:09:00.620 --> 3:09:03.620
 It's just predictable human behavior.

3:09:03.620 --> 3:09:07.620
 Let me ask you about this because it comes up often.

3:09:07.620 --> 3:09:14.620
 So I'm from MIT and there's a guy by the name of Jeffrey Epstein that still troubles me to this day.

3:09:14.620 --> 3:09:26.620
 That some of the people I respect were interacted with this individual and fell into his influence.

3:09:26.620 --> 3:09:36.620
 The charm, charisma, whatever the hell he used to delude these people, he did so successfully.

3:09:36.620 --> 3:09:38.620
 I'm very open minded about this thing.

3:09:38.620 --> 3:09:47.620
 I would love to learn more, but a lot of people tell me, a lot of people I respect, that there's intelligence agencies behind this individual.

3:09:47.620 --> 3:09:56.620
 So they were using Jeffrey Epstein for getting access to powerful people and then to control and manipulate those powerful people.

3:09:56.620 --> 3:10:01.620
 The CIA, I believe, is not brought up as often as Mossad.

3:10:01.620 --> 3:10:13.620
 And so this goes back to the original aspect of our conversation is how much each individual intelligence agencies is willing to go to control, to manipulate, to achieve its means.

3:10:13.620 --> 3:10:26.620
 Can you educate me if, obviously, you don't know, but you can bet what are the chances the intelligence agencies are involved with the character of Jeffrey Epstein?

3:10:26.620 --> 3:10:34.620
 In some way, shape or form, with the character of Epstein, it's 100% guaranteed that some intelligence organization was involved.

3:10:34.620 --> 3:10:36.620
 But let's talk about why.

3:10:36.620 --> 3:10:42.620
 There's multiple types of intelligence assets, just like we were talking earlier.

3:10:42.620 --> 3:10:51.620
 There's foreign intelligence reporting assets, there's access agents, and then there's agents of influence.

3:10:51.620 --> 3:10:54.620
 Three different categories of intelligence.

3:10:54.620 --> 3:11:04.620
 One is when you talk about foreign intelligence reporters, these are people who have access to secrets and their job is to give you their secrets in exchange for gold or money or alcohol or prostitution or whatever else.

3:11:04.620 --> 3:11:08.620
 Their job is to give you secrets and then you pay them for the secrets.

3:11:08.620 --> 3:11:17.620
 Access agents, their job is to give you physical access or digital access to something of interest to you.

3:11:17.620 --> 3:11:22.620
 So maybe they're the ones that open a door that should have been locked and let you come in and stick your thumb drive in the computer.

3:11:22.620 --> 3:11:28.620
 Or maybe they're the ones that share a phone number with somebody and then they're just like, just don't tell them you got the phone number from me.

3:11:28.620 --> 3:11:30.620
 Their job is to give you access.

3:11:30.620 --> 3:11:32.620
 Then you have these agents of influence.

3:11:32.620 --> 3:11:45.620
 An agent of influence's job is to be part of your effort to influence the outcomes in some way that benefits your intelligence requirements, right?

3:11:45.620 --> 3:11:56.620
 Of these three types of people, the least scrupulous and the most shady is your agent of influence, because your agent of influence understands exactly what they're doing.

3:11:56.620 --> 3:12:04.620
 They know they're working with one guy and they know they're using the influence to manipulate some other guy.

3:12:04.620 --> 3:12:13.620
 When it comes to powerful people, especially wealthy powerful people, the only thing that interests them is power.

3:12:13.620 --> 3:12:15.620
 Money is not a challenge anymore.

3:12:15.620 --> 3:12:18.620
 Prestige, notoriety, none of those things are a challenge.

3:12:18.620 --> 3:12:20.620
 The rest of us, we're busy trying to make money.

3:12:20.620 --> 3:12:22.620
 We're busy trying to build a reputation.

3:12:22.620 --> 3:12:24.620
 We're busy trying to build a career, keep a family afloat.

3:12:24.620 --> 3:12:26.620
 At the highest levels, they're bored.

3:12:26.620 --> 3:12:28.620
 They don't need any of that.

3:12:28.620 --> 3:12:31.620
 The only thing that they care about is being able to wield power.

3:12:31.620 --> 3:12:43.620
 A character like Jeffrey Epstein is exactly the kind of character that the Chinese would want, the Russians would want, Mossad would want, the French would want.

3:12:43.620 --> 3:12:51.620
 It's too easy because the man had access to a wide range of American influential people.

3:12:51.620 --> 3:13:03.620
 For corporate espionage uses, for economic espionage uses, for national security espionage uses, it doesn't make any sense that a person like that wouldn't be targeted.

3:13:03.620 --> 3:13:04.620
 It doesn't.

3:13:04.620 --> 3:13:23.620
 The question is who and whether I think the really important distinction here was Jeffrey Epstein created or once he's achieved and built his network, was he then infiltrated?

3:13:23.620 --> 3:13:26.620
 That's a really important difference.

3:13:26.620 --> 3:13:29.620
 At which stage do you connect a person like that?

3:13:29.620 --> 3:13:40.620
 You start to notice maybe they're effective at building a network and then you start making a building a relationship to where at some point it's a job, they're working for you.

3:13:40.620 --> 3:13:43.620
 Or do you literally create a person like that?

3:13:43.620 --> 3:13:46.620
 Yeah, so intelligence organizations have different strategies here.

3:13:46.620 --> 3:13:49.620
 In the United States, we never create.

3:13:49.620 --> 3:13:52.620
 We don't have a budget cycle that allows us to create.

3:13:52.620 --> 3:13:56.620
 I mean, the maximum budget cycle in the United States is five years.

3:13:56.620 --> 3:14:07.620
 So even if we were to try to invest in some seed operation or create some character of influence, essentially every year you have to justify why you're spending budget.

3:14:07.620 --> 3:14:09.620
 And that becomes very difficult in a democracy like ours.

3:14:09.620 --> 3:14:16.620
 However, Russia and China are extremely adept at seed operations, long term operations.

3:14:16.620 --> 3:14:25.620
 They are willing to invest and develop and create an agent that serves their purposes.

3:14:25.620 --> 3:14:33.620
 Now, to create someone from scratch like Jeffrey Epstein, the probabilities are extremely low.

3:14:33.620 --> 3:14:44.620
 They would have had to start with like a thousand different targets and try to grow a thousand different, if you will, influencers and then hope that one of them hits kind of like a venture capital firm, right?

3:14:44.620 --> 3:14:46.620
 Invest in many hope that a few hits.

3:14:46.620 --> 3:14:52.620
 More likely they observed him at some point in his own natural rise.

3:14:52.620 --> 3:15:07.620
 They identified his personal vulnerability, very classic espionage technique, and then they stepped in, introduced themselves mid career and said, hey, we know you have this thing that you like that isn't really frowned upon by your own people, but we don't frown upon it.

3:15:07.620 --> 3:15:14.620
 And we can help you both succeed and, you know, have an endless supply of ladies along the way.

3:15:14.620 --> 3:15:25.620
 Everything you talk to Ryan Graves, who's a lieutenant, Ryan Graves, who's a fighter jet pilot, about many things.

3:15:25.620 --> 3:15:32.620
 He also does work on autonomous weapon systems, drones and that kind of thing, including quantum computing.

3:15:32.620 --> 3:15:42.620
 But he also happens to be one of the very few pilots that were willing to go on record and talk about UFO sightings.

3:15:42.620 --> 3:15:47.620
 Does the CIA and the federal government have interest in UFOs?

3:15:47.620 --> 3:15:54.620
 In my experience at CIA, that is an area that remains very compartmented.

3:15:54.620 --> 3:15:57.620
 And that could be one of two reasons.

3:15:57.620 --> 3:16:01.620
 It could be because there is significant interest and that's why it's so heavily compartmented.

3:16:01.620 --> 3:16:06.620
 Or it could be because it's an area that's non, that's just not important.

3:16:06.620 --> 3:16:12.620
 It's a distraction, so they compartment it so it doesn't distract from other operations.

3:16:12.620 --> 3:16:18.620
 One of the areas that I've been quite interested in and where I've done a lot of research

3:16:18.620 --> 3:16:24.620
 and I've done some work in the private intelligence and private investigation side is with UFOs.

3:16:24.620 --> 3:16:32.620
 The place where UFOs really connect with the federal government is when it comes to aviation safety and predominance of power.

3:16:32.620 --> 3:16:40.620
 So FAA and US Air Force and US military are very invested in knowing what's happening in the skies above the United States.

3:16:40.620 --> 3:16:43.620
 And that's of primary interest to them.

3:16:43.620 --> 3:16:49.620
 When they can rule out the direct threat to national security of UFOs, then they become less interested.

3:16:49.620 --> 3:16:55.620
 That said, when you have unexplained aerial phenomenon that are unexplained,

3:16:55.620 --> 3:17:03.620
 that can't directly be tied to anything that is known of the terrestrial world,

3:17:03.620 --> 3:17:07.620
 then they're left without an answer to their question.

3:17:07.620 --> 3:17:09.620
 They don't know if it's a threat or not a threat.

3:17:09.620 --> 3:17:14.620
 But I think the scarier concern for the US national government or for the US federal government,

3:17:14.620 --> 3:17:19.620
 the scarier concern that nobody talks about is what if the UFO isn't alien.

3:17:19.620 --> 3:17:28.620
 What if it is actually a cutting edge war machine that we are eons behind ever being able to replicate?

3:17:28.620 --> 3:17:37.620
 Or the other concern is that it's a system, it's a machine from a foreign power that's doing intelligence collection.

3:17:37.620 --> 3:17:38.620
 Correct.

3:17:38.620 --> 3:17:43.620
 So it's not just military purposes, it's actually collecting data.

3:17:43.620 --> 3:17:44.620
 Well, they fall.

3:17:44.620 --> 3:17:46.620
 A lot of times the federal government will see the two as the same.

3:17:46.620 --> 3:17:49.620
 It's a hostile tool from a foreign government.

3:17:49.620 --> 3:17:53.620
 It's a collection of information is a hostile act.

3:17:53.620 --> 3:17:54.620
 Absolutely.

3:17:54.620 --> 3:17:56.620
 That's why the Espionage Act exists.

3:17:56.620 --> 3:18:02.620
 That's why it's a criminal offense if you're committing espionage in the United States as a US citizen or a foreign citizen.

3:18:02.620 --> 3:18:06.620
 So I guess they keep digging until they can confirm it's not a threat.

3:18:06.620 --> 3:18:16.620
 And you're saying that there's not, from your understanding, much evidence that they're doing so, it could be because they're compartmentalized.

3:18:16.620 --> 3:18:24.620
 But you're saying private intelligence institutions are trying to make progress on this.

3:18:24.620 --> 3:18:28.620
 Yeah, it's really difficult to know the scale.

3:18:28.620 --> 3:18:33.620
 Yeah, there's an economic interest in the private intelligence world.

3:18:33.620 --> 3:18:46.620
 Because, for example, if you understand why certain aerial phenomenon are happening over a location, then you can use that to inform investors, whether to invest in that location or avoid investment in that location.

3:18:46.620 --> 3:18:48.620
 But that's not a national security concern.

3:18:48.620 --> 3:18:51.620
 So that doesn't, it doesn't matter to the federal government.

3:18:51.620 --> 3:18:54.620
 Could these UFOs be aliens?

3:18:54.620 --> 3:19:01.620
 Now I'm going into a territory of you as a human being wondering about all the alien civilizations that are out there.

3:19:01.620 --> 3:19:03.620
 The hum, the humbling question.

3:19:03.620 --> 3:19:05.620
 We are not alone.

3:19:05.620 --> 3:19:06.620
 You think we're not alone?

3:19:06.620 --> 3:19:10.620
 There's, it's an improbability that we are alone.

3:19:10.620 --> 3:19:25.620
 If by virtue of the fact that sentient human life exists, intelligent human life exists, all the probabilities that would have to be destroyed for that to be true, simply speak over the galaxies that exist, that there's no possible way we're alone.

3:19:25.620 --> 3:19:27.620
 It's a mathematical equation.

3:19:27.620 --> 3:19:30.620
 It's a, it's a one or a zero, right?

3:19:30.620 --> 3:19:32.620
 For me, it has to exist.

3:19:32.620 --> 3:19:39.620
 It's impossible otherwise, rationally for me to think that we are truly the only intelligent life form in all of the universe.

3:19:39.620 --> 3:19:49.620
 But to think that an alien life form is anything like us at all is equally as inconceivable.

3:19:49.620 --> 3:20:05.620
 To think that they're carbon based, bipedal, humanoid, alien species that just happened to fly around in metal machines and visit alien planets in a way that they become observed is, it's just silly.

3:20:05.620 --> 3:20:07.620
 It's the world of sci fi.

3:20:07.620 --> 3:20:12.620
 Every good scientist, because we always assume that they're superior to us in intelligence.

3:20:12.620 --> 3:20:22.620
 When any scientist carries out an experiment, the whole objective of the experiment is to observe without being disclosed or being discovered.

3:20:22.620 --> 3:20:30.620
 So why on earth would we think that the superior species makes the mistake of being discovered over and over again?

3:20:30.620 --> 3:20:38.620
 So to push back on that idea, if we were to think about us humans trying to communicate with ants, first we observe for a while.

3:20:38.620 --> 3:20:53.620
 There'll be a bunch of PhDs written, a bunch of people just sort of collecting data, taking notes, trying to understand about this thing that you detected that seems to be a living thing, which is a very difficult thing to define from an alien perspective.

3:20:53.620 --> 3:20:56.620
 Or from our perspective, we find left on Mars or something like that.

3:20:56.620 --> 3:21:03.620
 Okay, so you observe for a while, but then if you want to actually interact with it, how would you interact with the ants?

3:21:03.620 --> 3:21:09.620
 If I were to interact with the ants, I would try to infiltrate.

3:21:09.620 --> 3:21:16.620
 I would try to figure out what is the language they used to communicate with each other.

3:21:16.620 --> 3:21:32.620
 I would try to operate at their physical scale, like in terms of the physics of their interaction, in terms of the information, methods, mediums of information exchange with pheromones or whatever, however the heck ants.

3:21:32.620 --> 3:21:35.620
 So I would try to mimic them in some way.

3:21:35.620 --> 3:21:49.620
 So in that sense, it makes sense that the objects we would see, you mentioned by Peter, yes, of course, it's ridiculous that aliens would actually be very similar to us.

3:21:49.620 --> 3:22:02.620
 But maybe they create forms in order to be like, here, the humans will understand it and this needs to be sufficiently different from humans to know that there's something weird.

3:22:02.620 --> 3:22:10.620
 I don't know, I think it's actually an incredibly difficult problem of figuring out how to communicate with a thing way dumber than you.

3:22:10.620 --> 3:22:23.620
 People assume, like, if you're smart, it's easy to talk to the dumb thing, but I think it's actually extremely difficult when the gap in intelligence is just orders of magnitude.

3:22:23.620 --> 3:22:31.620
 And so, of course, you can observe, but once you notice the thing is sufficiently interesting, how do you communicate with that thing?

3:22:31.620 --> 3:22:43.620
 So this is where one of the things I always try to highlight is how conspiracies are born, because many people don't understand how easy it is to fall into the conspiratorial cycle.

3:22:43.620 --> 3:22:56.620
 So the first step to a conspiracy being born is to have a piece of evidence that is true, and then immediately following the true evidence is a gap in information.

3:22:56.620 --> 3:23:11.620
 And then to fill in the gap of information, people create an idea, and then the next logical outcome is based on the idea that they just created, which is an idea that's based on something that was imagined in the first place.

3:23:11.620 --> 3:23:17.620
 So the idea, the factual thing is now two steps away, and then three steps away, four steps away as the things go on.

3:23:17.620 --> 3:23:22.620
 And then all of a sudden you have this kernel of truth that turned into this wild conspiracy.

3:23:22.620 --> 3:23:28.620
 So in our example, you talked about humans trying to communicate with ants, ants are not intelligent.

3:23:28.620 --> 3:23:30.620
 There's no ants are not intelligent species.

3:23:30.620 --> 3:23:35.620
 They're drone species that's somehow commanded through whatever technology, whatever...

3:23:35.620 --> 3:23:37.620
 It's spoken like a typical human, but yes.

3:23:37.620 --> 3:23:44.620
 Whatever biological thing is in the queen, but it's not a fair equivalent, but let's look at gorillas, or let's look at something in the monkey family.

3:23:44.620 --> 3:23:53.620
 We're largely, we agree that there is some sort of intelligence there, or dolphins, some sort of intelligence.

3:23:53.620 --> 3:24:01.620
 It is a human thing, a human thing to want to observe and then communicate and integrate.

3:24:01.620 --> 3:24:05.620
 That's a human thing, not an intelligent life thing.

3:24:05.620 --> 3:24:16.620
 So for us to even think that a foreign and intelligent alien species would want to engage in communicate at all is an extremely human assumption.

3:24:16.620 --> 3:24:19.620
 And then from that assumption, then we started going into all the other things you said.

3:24:19.620 --> 3:24:22.620
 If they wanted to communicate, wouldn't they want to mimic?

3:24:22.620 --> 3:24:25.620
 If they wanted to mimic, wouldn't they create devices like ours?

3:24:25.620 --> 3:24:32.620
 So now we're three steps removed from the true fact of there's something unexplainable in the skies.

3:24:32.620 --> 3:24:42.620
 Yeah, so the fact is there's something unexplainable in the skies, and then we're filling in the gaps with all our basic human biases and assumptions.

3:24:42.620 --> 3:24:44.620
 But the thing is...

3:24:44.620 --> 3:24:46.620
 Now we're getting right back to Project Northwood.

3:24:46.620 --> 3:24:48.620
 We need some plan.

3:24:48.620 --> 3:24:50.620
 I don't care how crazy the idea is, guys, give me some plan.

3:24:50.620 --> 3:24:52.620
 So that's where we come up with.

3:24:52.620 --> 3:25:00.620
 Maybe it's an alien species trying to communicate, or maybe it's an alien, a hostile threat that's trying to take over the world, or who knows what?

3:25:00.620 --> 3:25:02.620
 Maybe it's...

3:25:02.620 --> 3:25:09.620
 But you have to somehow construct hypotheses and theories for anomalies.

3:25:09.620 --> 3:25:21.620
 And then from that, amidst the giant pile of the ridiculous emerges perhaps a deeper truth over a period of decades.

3:25:21.620 --> 3:25:28.620
 And at first that truth is ridiculed, and then it's accepted that whole process.

3:25:28.620 --> 3:25:30.620
 The Earth revolving around the sun?

3:25:30.620 --> 3:25:32.620
 Yeah, the Earth revolving around the sun.

3:25:32.620 --> 3:25:47.620
 But to me, it's interesting because it asks us looking out there with SETI, just looking for alien life, is forcing us to really ask questions about ourselves, about what is life, how special?

3:25:47.620 --> 3:25:49.620
 First of all, what is intelligence?

3:25:49.620 --> 3:25:52.620
 How special is intelligence in the cosmos?

3:25:52.620 --> 3:26:01.620
 And I think it's inspiring and challenging to us as human beings, both on a scientific and engineering level, but also on a philosophical level.

3:26:01.620 --> 3:26:06.620
 I mean, all of those questions are laid before us when you start to think about alien life.

3:26:06.620 --> 3:26:08.620
 So you interviewed Joe Rogan recently.

3:26:08.620 --> 3:26:09.620
 Yeah.

3:26:09.620 --> 3:26:14.620
 And he said something that I thought was really brilliant during the podcast interview.

3:26:14.620 --> 3:26:15.620
 He said that you...

3:26:15.620 --> 3:26:17.620
 He's gonna love hearing that.

3:26:17.620 --> 3:26:29.620
 But he said that he realized at some point that the turn in his opinion about UFOs happened when he realized how desperately he wanted it to be true.

3:26:29.620 --> 3:26:33.620
 This is the human condition.

3:26:33.620 --> 3:26:36.620
 Our pink matter works the same way as everybody's pink matter.

3:26:36.620 --> 3:26:41.620
 And one of the ways that our pink matter works is with this thing, with what's known as a cognitive bias.

3:26:41.620 --> 3:26:42.620
 It's a mental shortcut.

3:26:42.620 --> 3:26:47.620
 Essentially, your brain doesn't want to process through facts over and over again.

3:26:47.620 --> 3:26:50.620
 Instead, it wants to assume certain facts are in place and just jump right to the conclusion.

3:26:50.620 --> 3:26:51.620
 It saves energy.

3:26:51.620 --> 3:26:52.620
 It saves megabytes.

3:26:52.620 --> 3:26:59.620
 So what Joe, what Joe or Joe Rogan, I feel weird calling him Joe, I don't know him, but what Joe identified on his own...

3:26:59.620 --> 3:27:00.620
 Mr. Rogan.

3:27:00.620 --> 3:27:06.620
 What Mr. Rogan identified on his own was his own cognitive loop.

3:27:06.620 --> 3:27:09.620
 And then he immediately grew suspicious of that loop.

3:27:09.620 --> 3:27:19.620
 That is a super powerful tool. That is something that most people never become self actualized enough to realize that they have a cognitive loop, let alone questioning their own cognitive loop.

3:27:19.620 --> 3:27:30.620
 So that was when it came to this topic specifically, that was just something that I thought was really powerful because you learned to not trust your own mind.

3:27:30.620 --> 3:27:35.620
 Just for the record, after he drinks one whiskey, all that goes out.

3:27:35.620 --> 3:27:40.620
 I think that was just in that moment in time.

3:27:40.620 --> 3:27:41.620
 A moment of brilliance.

3:27:41.620 --> 3:27:42.620
 A moment of brilliance.

3:27:42.620 --> 3:27:48.620
 Because I think he still is...

3:27:48.620 --> 3:27:53.620
 He's definitely one of the things that inspires me about Joe is how open minded he is, how curious he is.

3:27:53.620 --> 3:28:04.620
 He refuses to let the conformity and the conventions of any one community, including the scientific community, be a kind of thing that limits his curiosity.

3:28:04.620 --> 3:28:08.620
 What if it's entirely possible?

3:28:08.620 --> 3:28:09.620
 I think that's a beautiful thing.

3:28:09.620 --> 3:28:14.620
 It actually represents what the best of science is, that childlike curiosity.

3:28:14.620 --> 3:28:19.620
 So it's good to balance those two things, but then you have to wake up to it.

3:28:19.620 --> 3:28:26.620
 Is there a chance this is true or do I just really want it to be true?

3:28:26.620 --> 3:28:29.620
 Like the hot girl that talks to you overseas?

3:28:29.620 --> 3:28:30.620
 Yeah.

3:28:30.620 --> 3:28:34.620
 For a brief moment.

3:28:34.620 --> 3:28:42.620
 There's actually a deeper explanation for it that I'll tell you off the mic that perhaps a lot of people can kind of figure out.

3:28:42.620 --> 3:28:43.620
 Anyway.

3:28:43.620 --> 3:28:45.620
 Just to take it one step further, because I love this stuff.

3:28:45.620 --> 3:28:48.620
 Personally, I love pink matter stuff.

3:28:48.620 --> 3:28:52.620
 In your interview with Jack Barski, Jack's a good friend of mine, a good dude.

3:28:52.620 --> 3:28:53.620
 Incredible person.

3:28:53.620 --> 3:29:08.620
 In your conversation with Jack Barski, you guys, he started talking to you about how his recruiters were feeding back to him, his own beliefs, his own opinions about himself, how smart he was, how good he was, how uniquely qualified he was.

3:29:08.620 --> 3:29:10.620
 That's all pink matter manipulation.

3:29:10.620 --> 3:29:22.620
 Feeding right back to the person, what they already think of themselves is a way to get them to invest and trust you faster, because obviously you value them for all the right reasons, because that's how they see themselves.

3:29:22.620 --> 3:29:30.620
 So that loop that the KGB was using with Jack, Jack did not wake up to that loop at the time.

3:29:30.620 --> 3:29:32.620
 He woke up to it later.

3:29:32.620 --> 3:29:34.620
 So it happens to all of us.

3:29:34.620 --> 3:29:36.620
 We're all in a loop.

3:29:36.620 --> 3:29:46.620
 It's just whether it's about oat milk, or whether it's about aliens, or whether it's about, you know, the Democrats trying to take your guns, whatever it is, everybody's in a loop.

3:29:46.620 --> 3:29:53.620
 And we've got to wake up to ask ourselves, just like you said, is it true, or do we just really want it to be true?

3:29:53.620 --> 3:29:57.620
 And until you ask yourself that question, you're just one of the masses trapped in the loop.

3:29:57.620 --> 3:30:24.620
 Yeah, that's the Nietzsche gaze into the abyss. It's a dangerous thing. That's the path to insanity is to ask that question. You want to be doing it carefully, but it's also the place where you can truly discover something fundamental about this world that people don't understand, and then lay the groundwork for progress, scientific, cultural, all that kind of stuff.

3:30:24.620 --> 3:30:26.620
 Absolutely.

3:30:26.620 --> 3:30:28.620
 What is one spy trick?

3:30:28.620 --> 3:30:30.620
 This is from a Reddit that I really enjoy.

3:30:30.620 --> 3:30:32.620
 What's one spy trick?

3:30:32.620 --> 3:30:40.620
 And you're full of a million spy tricks. People should follow you. You did an amazing podcast. You're just an amazing person.

3:30:40.620 --> 3:30:41.620
 Thank you.

3:30:41.620 --> 3:30:47.620
 What is the one spy trick you would teach everyone that they can use to improve their life instantly?

3:30:47.620 --> 3:30:53.620
 Now, you already mentioned quite a few, but what else could jump to mind?

3:30:53.620 --> 3:31:05.620
 My go to answer for this has not really changed much over the last few years. So the first, the most important spy trick to change everything immediately is something called perception versus perspective.

3:31:05.620 --> 3:31:09.620
 We all look at the world through our own perception.

3:31:09.620 --> 3:31:19.620
 My dad used to tell me, my stepdad used to tell me that perception is reality, and I was arguing this with him when I was 14 years old. I told you so, dad, you're still wrong.

3:31:19.620 --> 3:31:20.620
 Yeah.

3:31:20.620 --> 3:31:26.620
 But perception is your interpretation of the world around you, but it's unique only to you.

3:31:26.620 --> 3:31:35.620
 There's no advantage in your perception. That's why so many people find themselves arguing all the time, trying to convince other people of their own perception.

3:31:35.620 --> 3:31:49.620
 The way that you win any argument, the way that you get ahead in your career, the way that you outsell or outrace anybody is when you move off of perception and move into perspective.

3:31:49.620 --> 3:31:55.620
 Perspective is the act or the art of observing the world from outside of yourself.

3:31:55.620 --> 3:32:09.620
 Whether that's outside of yourself as like an entity just observing a third from a different point of view, or even more powerful, you sit in the shoes, you sit in the seat of the person opposite you, and you think to yourself, what is their life like?

3:32:09.620 --> 3:32:11.620
 What do they feel right now?

3:32:11.620 --> 3:32:21.620
 Are they comfortable? Are they uncomfortable? Are they afraid? Are they scared? What's the stressor that they woke up to this morning? What's the stressor that they're going to go to sleep with tonight?

3:32:21.620 --> 3:32:31.620
 When you shift places and get out of your own perception and into someone else's perspective, now you're thinking like them, which is giving you an informational advantage.

3:32:31.620 --> 3:32:39.620
 But you know what they're all doing? Everyone else out there is trapped in their own perception, not thinking about a different perspective.

3:32:39.620 --> 3:32:46.620
 Immediately you have superior information, superior positioning, you have an advantage that they don't have.

3:32:46.620 --> 3:32:52.620
 And if you do that to your boss, it's going to change your career. If you do that to your spouse, it's going to change your marriage.

3:32:52.620 --> 3:32:58.620
 If you do that to your kids, it's going to change your family legacy because nobody else out there is doing it.

3:32:58.620 --> 3:33:14.620
 It's so interesting how difficult empathy is for people and how powerful it is, especially for spouse intimacy, stepping outside of yourself and really putting yourself in the shoes of the other person considering how they see the world.

3:33:14.620 --> 3:33:29.620
 I really enjoy that because how does that exactly lead to connection? I think when you start to understand the way the other person sees the world,

3:33:29.620 --> 3:33:40.620
 you start to enjoy the world through their eyes and you start to be able to share, in terms of intimacy, share the beauty that they see together because you understand their perspective.

3:33:40.620 --> 3:33:47.620
 And then somehow you converge as well. Of course, that allows you to gather information better and all that kind of stuff.

3:33:47.620 --> 3:33:55.620
 That allows you to work together better to share in all different kinds of ways, but for intimacy, that's a really powerful thing.

3:33:55.620 --> 3:34:09.620
 And also for people you really disagree with or people on the internet you disagree with and so on, I find empathy is such a powerful way to resolve any tensions there.

3:34:09.620 --> 3:34:21.620
 Even like people like trolls or all that kind of stuff, I don't deride them. I just kind of put myself in their shoes and it becomes like an enjoyable camaraderie with that person.

3:34:21.620 --> 3:34:34.620
 So I want to draw a pretty hard line between perspective and empathy because empathy is frankly an overused term by people who don't really know what they're saying sometimes.

3:34:34.620 --> 3:34:37.620
 I think you know what you're saying, but the vast majority of people listening.

3:34:37.620 --> 3:34:39.620
 I would argue that, but that's fine.

3:34:39.620 --> 3:34:43.620
 As soon as you say empathy, they're going to just be like, oh yeah, I know I've heard this a thousand times.

3:34:43.620 --> 3:34:51.620
 Empathy is about feeling what other people feel.

3:34:51.620 --> 3:34:54.620
 Yeah, it's about feelings. It's about understanding someone else's feelings.

3:34:54.620 --> 3:35:03.620
 Feeling, it's not the same as sympathy where you feel their feelings. Empathy is about recognizing that they have feelings and recognizing that their feelings are valid.

3:35:03.620 --> 3:35:13.620
 Perspective is more than just feelings. It's about the brain. It's about the pink matter on the left side and the right side of the brain.

3:35:13.620 --> 3:35:22.620
 Yes, I care about feelings and this goes directly to your point about connection. Yes, I care about feelings, but I also care about objectives.

3:35:22.620 --> 3:35:26.620
 What is your life? What is your aspirational goal? What was it like to grow up as you?

3:35:26.620 --> 3:35:35.620
 What was it like to experience this and how did this shape your opinion on that and what is it that you're going to do next?

3:35:35.620 --> 3:35:38.620
 More than just feelings, actual tactical actions.

3:35:38.620 --> 3:35:47.620
 That becomes extremely valuable in the operational world because if you can get into someone's head, left brain and right brain, feelings and logic,

3:35:47.620 --> 3:35:49.620
 you can start anticipating what actions they're going to take next.

3:35:49.620 --> 3:35:55.620
 You can direct the actions that they're going to take next because you're basically telling them the story that's in their own head.

3:35:55.620 --> 3:35:59.620
 When it comes to relationships and personal connection, we talked about it earlier.

3:35:59.620 --> 3:36:07.620
 The thing that people want the most is community. They want someone else who understands them.

3:36:07.620 --> 3:36:10.620
 They want to be with people. They don't want to be alone.

3:36:10.620 --> 3:36:18.620
 The more you practice perspective, empathy or no empathy, the more you just validate that a person is there.

3:36:18.620 --> 3:36:28.620
 I am in this time and space with you in this moment. Feelings aside. That is powerful. That is intimate.

3:36:28.620 --> 3:36:35.620
 Whether you're talking about lovers or whether you're talking about a business exchange or whether you're talking about collaborators in a crime,

3:36:35.620 --> 3:36:40.620
 I'm here with you ride or die. Let's do it. That's powerful.

3:36:40.620 --> 3:36:50.620
 How much of what you've learned in your role at the CIA transfer over to relationships, the business relationship to other aspects of life.

3:36:50.620 --> 3:36:54.620
 This is something you work closely with powerful people to help them out.

3:36:54.620 --> 3:36:59.620
 What have you learned about the commonalities about the problems that people face?

3:36:59.620 --> 3:37:06.620
 Man, I would say about a solid 95% of what I learned at CIA carries over to the civilian world.

3:37:06.620 --> 3:37:12.620
 That 5% that doesn't, it would carry over in a disaster.

3:37:12.620 --> 3:37:19.620
 Knowing how to shoot on target with my non dominant hand really only has one purpose.

3:37:19.620 --> 3:37:22.620
 It's not going to happen day to day.

3:37:22.620 --> 3:37:29.620
 Knowing how to do a dead drop that isn't discoverable by the local police force isn't going to be useful right now, but it could be useful in a disaster.

3:37:29.620 --> 3:37:33.620
 But the 95% of stuff that's useful, it's all tied to the human condition.

3:37:33.620 --> 3:37:46.620
 It's all tied to being able to understand what someone's thinking, understand what someone's feeling, direct their thoughts, direct their emotions, direct their thought process,

3:37:46.620 --> 3:37:54.620
 win their attention, win their loyalty, win influence with them, grow your network, grow your own circle of influence.

3:37:54.620 --> 3:37:58.620
 I mean, all of that is immensely, immensely valuable.

3:37:58.620 --> 3:38:03.620
 As an example, the disguise, the disguise thing that we talked about earlier.

3:38:03.620 --> 3:38:06.620
 Disguise in and of itself has mixed utility.

3:38:06.620 --> 3:38:10.620
 If you're Brad Pitt and you don't want anybody to know you're Brad Pitt, you put on a level one disguise and that's great.

3:38:10.620 --> 3:38:16.620
 Or maybe you call me and I walk you through a level two disguise so that you can go to Aruba and nobody's going to know you're in Aruba, right?

3:38:16.620 --> 3:38:18.620
 Whatever it is.

3:38:18.620 --> 3:38:24.620
 But even there, with the 5% that doesn't apply to everyday life, there's still elements that do.

3:38:24.620 --> 3:38:33.620
 For example, when a person looks at a human being's face, the first place they look is the same part of the face as if they were reading a piece of paper.

3:38:33.620 --> 3:38:38.620
 So in English, we start from the top left and we read left to right, top to bottom.

3:38:38.620 --> 3:38:44.620
 So when an English speaking person interacts with another person, the first thing they look at isn't their eyes.

3:38:44.620 --> 3:38:51.620
 It's the upper left from their point of view, corner of their face, right?

3:38:51.620 --> 3:38:57.620
 They look there and the information they get is hair color, hair pattern, skin color, right?

3:38:57.620 --> 3:38:58.620
 That's it.

3:38:58.620 --> 3:39:00.620
 Before they know anything else about the face.

3:39:00.620 --> 3:39:04.620
 This is one of the reasons why somebody can look at you and then you ask them, what color are my eyes?

3:39:04.620 --> 3:39:09.620
 I don't really remember because the way they read the face, they read it from left to right, top to bottom.

3:39:09.620 --> 3:39:14.620
 So they're paying a lot of attention to the first few things they see and then they're paying less attention as they go down the face.

3:39:14.620 --> 3:39:18.620
 The same scrolling behavior that you see on the internet, right?

3:39:18.620 --> 3:39:22.620
 So when you understand that through the lens of disguise, it allows you to make a very powerful disguise.

3:39:22.620 --> 3:39:26.620
 The most important part of your disguise is here, if you're English speaking, right?

3:39:26.620 --> 3:39:30.620
 Here, if you're speaking some foreign languages that read right to left, right?

3:39:30.620 --> 3:39:35.620
 If it's Chinese, you know that they're going to look from here down because they read left down.

3:39:35.620 --> 3:39:37.620
 So it's so interesting.

3:39:37.620 --> 3:39:41.620
 So knowing that really helps you sort of configure the things in terms of physical appearance.

3:39:41.620 --> 3:39:42.620
 Correct.

3:39:42.620 --> 3:39:47.620
 So when it comes to how to make a disguise, not so useful to the ultra wealthy usually.

3:39:47.620 --> 3:39:53.620
 But when it comes to how to read a face or more importantly, how people are going to read your face, that's extremely important.

3:39:53.620 --> 3:39:59.620
 Because now you know where to find the first signs of deception in a baseline or anything else.

3:39:59.620 --> 3:40:11.620
 You mentioned that the idea of having privacy is one that we think we can, but we really don't.

3:40:11.620 --> 3:40:17.620
 Is it possible for maybe somebody like me or a regular person to disappear from the grid?

3:40:17.620 --> 3:40:18.620
 Absolutely.

3:40:18.620 --> 3:40:19.620
 Yeah.

3:40:19.620 --> 3:40:20.620
 And it's not as hard as you might think.

3:40:20.620 --> 3:40:21.620
 It's not convenient.

3:40:21.620 --> 3:40:24.620
 Again, convenience and security.

3:40:24.620 --> 3:40:26.620
 You can disappear tomorrow, right?

3:40:26.620 --> 3:40:30.620
 I can walk you through three steps right now that are going to help you disappear tomorrow, but none of them are convenient.

3:40:30.620 --> 3:40:33.620
 They're all extremely secure, right?

3:40:33.620 --> 3:40:40.620
 The first thing you do is every piece of digital technology you have that is connected to you in any way is now dead.

3:40:40.620 --> 3:40:42.620
 You just let the battery run out.

3:40:42.620 --> 3:40:43.620
 Forever.

3:40:43.620 --> 3:40:44.620
 Forever.

3:40:44.620 --> 3:40:46.620
 You never touch it again, starting at this moment.

3:40:46.620 --> 3:40:49.620
 What you have to do is go out and acquire a new one.

3:40:49.620 --> 3:40:55.620
 Realistically, you will not be able to acquire a new one in the United States by buying it.

3:40:55.620 --> 3:40:58.620
 Because to do so, you would tie it to your credit card.

3:40:58.620 --> 3:41:01.620
 You would tie it to a location, a time, a place, a registered name, whatever else.

3:41:01.620 --> 3:41:06.620
 So you would have to acquire it essentially by theft or through the black market.

3:41:06.620 --> 3:41:12.620
 So you would want something because you're going to need the advantage of technology without it being in your name.

3:41:12.620 --> 3:41:15.620
 So you go out and you steal a phone or you steal a laptop.

3:41:15.620 --> 3:41:21.620
 You do whatever you have to do to make sure that you can get on with the password and whatever else that might be as dirty or as clean as you want that to be.

3:41:21.620 --> 3:41:23.620
 We're all morally flexible here.

3:41:23.620 --> 3:41:28.620
 But now you have a technological device that you can work with.

3:41:28.620 --> 3:41:38.620
 And then from there on, you're just doing whatever you have to do, whether you're stealing every step of the way or whether you run a massive con.

3:41:38.620 --> 3:41:41.620
 Keep in mind that we often talk about con men and cons.

3:41:41.620 --> 3:41:45.620
 Do you know what the root, the word that con is a root word for?

3:41:45.620 --> 3:41:47.620
 Confidence.

3:41:47.620 --> 3:41:49.620
 That's what a con man is.

3:41:49.620 --> 3:41:51.620
 A con man is a confidence man.

3:41:51.620 --> 3:41:59.620
 Just somebody who is so brazenly confident that the people around them living in their own perception, not perspective and their perception.

3:41:59.620 --> 3:42:01.620
 They're like, well, this guy really knows what he's talking about.

3:42:01.620 --> 3:42:03.620
 So I'm going to do what he says.

3:42:03.620 --> 3:42:06.620
 So you can run a massive con and that can take care of your finances.

3:42:06.620 --> 3:42:09.620
 That can take care of your lodging, whatever amount, whatever else it is.

3:42:09.620 --> 3:42:13.620
 You are whoever you present yourself to be.

3:42:13.620 --> 3:42:19.620
 So if you want to go be, if you want to be Bill for the afternoon, just go tell people your name is Bill.

3:42:19.620 --> 3:42:20.620
 They're not going to question you.

3:42:20.620 --> 3:42:35.620
 So the intelligence, the natural web of intelligence gathering systems we have in the United States and in the world, are they going to believe for long that you're Bill?

3:42:35.620 --> 3:42:39.620
 Until you do something that makes them think otherwise.

3:42:39.620 --> 3:42:42.620
 If you are consistent, we talked about consistency being the superpower.

3:42:42.620 --> 3:42:45.620
 If you are consistent, they will think you're Bill forever.

3:42:45.620 --> 3:42:48.620
 How difficult is that to do?

3:42:48.620 --> 3:42:50.620
 It's not convenient.

3:42:50.620 --> 3:42:51.620
 It's quite difficult.

3:42:51.620 --> 3:42:53.620
 Was that like required training?

3:42:53.620 --> 3:42:55.620
 It does require training.

3:42:55.620 --> 3:42:57.620
 Because why do criminals always get caught?

3:42:57.620 --> 3:42:59.620
 Because they stop being consistent.

3:42:59.620 --> 3:43:08.620
 Criminals, I never hesitate to admit this, but people tell me I should hesitate to admit it.

3:43:08.620 --> 3:43:12.620
 So now I hesitate because of the guidance I've gotten to hesitate, right?

3:43:12.620 --> 3:43:13.620
 I like criminals.

3:43:13.620 --> 3:43:15.620
 I'm friends with a number of criminals.

3:43:15.620 --> 3:43:20.620
 Because the only people who get me, right away who get me, are criminals.

3:43:20.620 --> 3:43:28.620
 Because we know what it's like to basically abandon all the rules, do our own thing, our own way, and watch the world just keep turning.

3:43:28.620 --> 3:43:38.620
 Most people are so stuck in the trap of normal thought and behavior that when I tell them, they just go tell people your name is Bill.

3:43:38.620 --> 3:43:41.620
 Most people are going to say, that's not going to work.

3:43:41.620 --> 3:43:43.620
 But a criminal will be like, oh yeah, I did that once.

3:43:43.620 --> 3:43:47.620
 I just told everybody my name was Nancy and I'm a dude and they still believe me.

3:43:47.620 --> 3:43:49.620
 Criminals just get it, right?

3:43:49.620 --> 3:43:55.620
 So what happens with criminals is they go to the school of hard knocks.

3:43:55.620 --> 3:43:59.620
 They learn criminal behavior on the job.

3:43:59.620 --> 3:44:01.620
 Spies go to school.

3:44:01.620 --> 3:44:04.620
 We go to the best spy school in the world.

3:44:04.620 --> 3:44:07.620
 We go to Langley's, the farm, right?

3:44:07.620 --> 3:44:09.620
 It was known as Field Tradecraft Course, FTC.

3:44:09.620 --> 3:44:13.620
 In a covert location for a covert period of time and covert, covert, covert.

3:44:13.620 --> 3:44:15.620
 So if anybody from CI is watching, I'm not breaking any rules.

3:44:15.620 --> 3:44:18.620
 It's all on Wikipedia, but it's not coming from me.

3:44:18.620 --> 3:44:20.620
 But we do, that's how we do it.

3:44:20.620 --> 3:44:30.620
 They train us from 100 years of experience in the best ways to carry out covert operations, which are all just criminal activities overseas.

3:44:30.620 --> 3:44:33.620
 We learn how to do it the right way so that we don't get caught.

3:44:33.620 --> 3:44:34.620
 We learn how to be consistent.

3:44:34.620 --> 3:44:42.620
 And importantly, we learn how to create an operation that has a limited lifespan because the longer it lives, the more at risk you are.

3:44:42.620 --> 3:44:49.620
 So you want operations to be short, concise, on the X, off the X, limit your room from mistakes.

3:44:49.620 --> 3:44:59.620
 Criminals want the default to wanting these long term operations because they don't want to have to recreate a new way to make money every 15 days.

3:44:59.620 --> 3:45:14.620
 You mentioned, if anybody from the CIA is watching, so I've seen you talk about the fact that sort of people that are currently working at the CIA would kind of look down on the people who've left the CIA,

3:45:14.620 --> 3:45:19.620
 and they divide them, especially if you go public, especially if there's a book and all that kind of stuff.

3:45:19.620 --> 3:45:31.620
 Do you feel the pressure of that to be quiet, to not do something like this conversation that we're doing today?

3:45:31.620 --> 3:45:33.620
 I feel the silent judgment.

3:45:33.620 --> 3:45:35.620
 That's very real.

3:45:35.620 --> 3:45:40.620
 I feel it for myself and I feel it for my wife who doesn't appear on camera very often, but who's also former CIA.

3:45:40.620 --> 3:45:42.620
 We both feel the judgment.

3:45:42.620 --> 3:45:51.620
 We know that right now, three days after this is released, somebody's going to send an email on a closed network system inside CIA headquarters,

3:45:51.620 --> 3:45:56.620
 and there's a bunch of people who are going to laugh at it, a bunch of people who are going to say that, who knows what, it's not going to be good stuff.

3:45:56.620 --> 3:45:58.620
 A bunch of people you respect probably.

3:45:58.620 --> 3:46:07.620
 A bunch of people who I'm trying to bring honor to, whether I know them or respect them as irrelevant, these are people who are out there doing the deed every day.

3:46:07.620 --> 3:46:22.620
 I want to bring them honor and I want to do that in a way that I get to share what they can't share and what they won't share when they leave because they will also feel the silent pressure, the pressure to shame the judgment.

3:46:22.620 --> 3:46:34.620
 The truth is that I've done this now long enough, the first few times that I spoke out publicly, the response to being a positive voice for what the sacrifices that people are making,

3:46:34.620 --> 3:46:42.620
 it's so refreshing to be an honest voice that people don't normally hear that it's too important.

3:46:42.620 --> 3:46:50.620
 One day I'm going to be gone and my kids are going to look back on all this, and they're going to see their dad trying to do the right thing for the right reasons.

3:46:50.620 --> 3:46:57.620
 And even if my son or daughter ends up at CIA, and even if they get ridiculed for being, oh, you're the Bustamante kid, right?

3:46:57.620 --> 3:47:00.620
 Your dad's a total sellout, whatever it might be.

3:47:00.620 --> 3:47:08.620
 I want them to know dad was doing what he could to bring honor to the organization even when he couldn't stay in the organization anymore.

3:47:08.620 --> 3:47:14.620
 So you said when you were 27, I think you didn't know what the hell you're doing.

3:47:14.620 --> 3:47:30.620
 So now that you're a few years older and wiser, let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat and give advice to other 27 year olds or even younger 17, 18 year olds.

3:47:30.620 --> 3:47:37.620
 They're just out of high school, maybe going to college, trying to figure out this life, this career thing that they're on.

3:47:37.620 --> 3:47:45.620
 What advice would you give them about how to have a career or how to have a life they can be proud of?

3:47:45.620 --> 3:47:49.620
 What's a powerful question, man?

3:47:49.620 --> 3:47:51.620
 Have you figured it out yet yourself?

3:47:51.620 --> 3:47:52.620
 No.

3:47:52.620 --> 3:47:53.620
 I think I'm a man.

3:47:53.620 --> 3:47:56.620
 I'm a grand total of seven days smarter than I was at 27.

3:47:56.620 --> 3:47:57.620
 It's not a good average.

3:47:57.620 --> 3:47:59.620
 Progress.

3:47:59.620 --> 3:48:00.620
 There's still time.

3:48:00.620 --> 3:48:02.620
 There's still time.

3:48:02.620 --> 3:48:12.620
 So for all the young people out there deciding what to do, I would just say the same thing that I would say that I do say and I will say to my own kids.

3:48:12.620 --> 3:48:14.620
 You only have one life.

3:48:14.620 --> 3:48:16.620
 You only have one chance.

3:48:16.620 --> 3:48:25.620
 If you spend it doing what other people expect you to do, you will wake up to your regret at some point.

3:48:25.620 --> 3:48:29.620
 I woke up when I was 38 years old.

3:48:29.620 --> 3:48:38.620
 My life in many ways is still waking up to it as she watches her grandparents pass and an older generation pass away.

3:48:38.620 --> 3:48:53.620
 The folks that really have a blessed life are the people who learn early on to live with their own rules, live their own way, and live every day as if it's the last day.

3:48:53.620 --> 3:49:04.620
 Not necessarily to waste it by being wasteful or silly, but to recognize that today is a day to be productive and constructive for yourself.

3:49:04.620 --> 3:49:09.620
 If you don't want a career, today is not the day to start pursuing a career just because someone else told you to do it.

3:49:09.620 --> 3:49:15.620
 If you want to learn a language, today is a day to find a way to buy a ticket to another country and learn through immersion.

3:49:15.620 --> 3:49:22.620
 If you want a date, if you want to get married, if you want a business, today is the day to just go out and take one step.

3:49:22.620 --> 3:49:24.620
 In that direction.

3:49:24.620 --> 3:49:29.620
 And as long as you, every day you just make one new step, just like CIA recruited me.

3:49:29.620 --> 3:49:31.620
 Just do the next thing.

3:49:31.620 --> 3:49:36.620
 If the first, if the step seems like it's too big, then there's probably two other steps that you can do before that.

3:49:36.620 --> 3:49:43.620
 Just make constant progress, build momentum, move forward, and live on your own terms.

3:49:43.620 --> 3:49:46.620
 That way you don't ever wake up to the regret.

3:49:46.620 --> 3:49:49.620
 And it'll be over before you know it.

3:49:49.620 --> 3:49:51.620
 Whether you regret it or not, it's true.

3:49:51.620 --> 3:49:55.620
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:49:55.620 --> 3:49:56.620
 What's the meaning of life?

3:49:56.620 --> 3:49:57.620
 Self respect.

3:49:57.620 --> 3:49:59.620
 That's a fast answer.

3:49:59.620 --> 3:50:01.620
 There's a story behind it if you want the story.

3:50:01.620 --> 3:50:03.620
 I would love to have the story.

3:50:03.620 --> 3:50:15.620
 There's a covert training base in Alabama in the South, far South, and like the armpit of America, where elite tier one operators go to learn human intelligence stuff.

3:50:15.620 --> 3:50:25.620
 And there's a bar inside this base, and on the wall is just, it scribbles of opinions.

3:50:25.620 --> 3:50:28.620
 And the question in the middle of the wall says, what's the meaning of life?

3:50:28.620 --> 3:50:36.620
 And all these elite operators over the last 25 or 30 years, they all go, they get drunk, and they scribble their answer, and they circle it with a sharpie.

3:50:36.620 --> 3:50:41.620
 Love, family, America, freedom, whatever.

3:50:41.620 --> 3:50:48.620
 And then the only thing they have to do is if they're going to write something on there, they have to connect it with something else on the wall, at least one other thing.

3:50:48.620 --> 3:50:50.620
 So if they write love, they can't just leave it floating there.

3:50:50.620 --> 3:50:55.620
 They have to write love in a little bubble and connect it to something else, connect it to family, whatever else.

3:50:55.620 --> 3:51:03.620
 When you look at that wall, the word self respect is on the wall, and it's got a circle around it.

3:51:03.620 --> 3:51:09.620
 And then you can't see any other word because of all the things that connect the self respect.

3:51:09.620 --> 3:51:18.620
 Just dozens of people have written over, have written their words down and been drawn and scribbled over because of all the lines that connect self respect.

3:51:18.620 --> 3:51:20.620
 So what's the meaning of life?

3:51:20.620 --> 3:51:23.620
 From my point of view, I've never seen a better answer.

3:51:23.620 --> 3:51:24.620
 It's all self respect.

3:51:24.620 --> 3:51:27.620
 If you don't respect yourself, how can you do anything else?

3:51:27.620 --> 3:51:29.620
 How can you love someone else if you don't have self respect?

3:51:29.620 --> 3:51:31.620
 How can you build the business you're proud of if you don't have self respect?

3:51:31.620 --> 3:51:32.620
 How can you raise kids?

3:51:32.620 --> 3:51:33.620
 How can you make a difference?

3:51:33.620 --> 3:51:35.620
 How can you pioneer anything?

3:51:35.620 --> 3:51:38.620
 How can you just wake up and have a good day?

3:51:38.620 --> 3:51:41.620
 If you don't have self respect.

3:51:41.620 --> 3:51:47.620
 The power of the individual, that's what makes this country great.

3:51:47.620 --> 3:52:04.620
 I have to say after traveling quite a bit in Europe and especially in a place of war, coming back to the United States makes me really appreciate about the better angels of this nation, the ideals it stands for, the values it stands for.

3:52:04.620 --> 3:52:28.620
 And I'd like to thank you for serving this nation for time and humanity for time and for being brave enough and bold enough to still talk about it and to inspire others, to educate others for having many amazing conversations and for honoring me by having this conversation today.

3:52:28.620 --> 3:52:29.620
 You're an amazing human.

3:52:29.620 --> 3:52:31.620
 Thanks so much for talking today.

3:52:31.620 --> 3:52:34.620
 I appreciate the invite, man. It was a joy.

3:52:34.620 --> 3:52:37.620
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Andrew Bustamante.

3:52:37.620 --> 3:52:41.620
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:52:41.620 --> 3:52:47.620
 And now let me leave you with some words from Sun Tzu in the art of war.

3:52:47.620 --> 3:52:51.620
 Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night.

3:52:51.620 --> 3:52:56.620
 And when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.

3:52:56.620 --> 3:53:08.620
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
