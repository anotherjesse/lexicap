00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
 The following is a conversation with Jimmy Pedro,

00:02.720 --> 00:05.200
 a legendary judo competitor and coach.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.560
 He represented the United States at four Olympics

00:08.560 --> 00:12.160
 in 92, 96, 2000, 2004,

00:12.160 --> 00:14.680
 winning a bronze medal at two of them.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.480
 He meddled in three world championships,

00:17.480 --> 00:20.120
 winning gold in 1999.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.640
 He has coached many of the elite level American judoka,

00:23.640 --> 00:26.120
 including Kayla Harrison, Ronda Rousey,

00:26.120 --> 00:28.480
 Travis Stevens, and many others.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.920
 Plus, he's not my judo coach, along with Travis Stevens.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.960
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.960
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:36.960 --> 00:38.360
 in the description.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.280
 And now, here's my conversation with Jimmy Pedro.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.640
 What is the most beautiful throw in judo to you?

00:47.760 --> 00:49.360
 I think Uchimata.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.120
 You know, it's the one that seems

00:51.120 --> 00:53.000
 to have the most amplitude.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.480
 Person goes the highest.

00:54.480 --> 00:57.240
 You see a leg swing through the middle.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.440
 The person doing the throw,

00:58.440 --> 00:59.640
 there's a leg swinging through the middle.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.080
 The other person definitely goes, you know,

01:02.080 --> 01:04.720
 head over heels, flat on their back.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.440
 It's probably the most dynamic,

01:06.440 --> 01:08.120
 pretty judo throw there is.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.520
 Okay, so it's a single,

01:09.520 --> 01:11.120
 you're standing on a single foot

01:11.120 --> 01:13.200
 and you're raising your other foot in the air

01:13.200 --> 01:14.800
 and it's a forward throw,

01:14.800 --> 01:19.560
 which means your back is facing the opponent,

01:19.560 --> 01:23.080
 but they kind of both fly through the air

01:23.080 --> 01:24.520
 and twist through the air.

01:24.520 --> 01:25.560
 Correct.

01:25.560 --> 01:28.440
 Yeah, so how does that throw work?

01:28.440 --> 01:30.440
 What are the principles behind that throw?

01:30.440 --> 01:33.480
 It's one of those throws that, you know,

01:33.480 --> 01:35.240
 people can kind of understand

01:35.240 --> 01:38.760
 how to pick up another human being in sort of trivial ways,

01:38.760 --> 01:42.080
 but the Uchimata to me never quite made sense,

01:42.080 --> 01:43.880
 like why it works.

01:43.880 --> 01:47.400
 There's a cork, there's a twisting motion.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.800
 There's some involvement of the hip,

01:49.800 --> 01:52.960
 but it's not really a hip throw

01:52.960 --> 01:55.640
 because the hip is not all the way over,

01:55.640 --> 01:58.280
 so it's not, it's a very confusing throw.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.040
 I'm trying to say something.

02:00.040 --> 02:00.880
 Can you say something?

02:00.880 --> 02:02.680
 It's probably one of the most difficult throws

02:02.680 --> 02:05.000
 to learn as well because it is so complex.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.920
 You do have to stand on one leg, balance on one leg,

02:07.920 --> 02:10.080
 you know, swing your other leg through the middle,

02:10.080 --> 02:12.080
 hold your opponent up in the air

02:12.080 --> 02:16.120
 and it's hard to make that contact

02:16.120 --> 02:18.440
 with upper body to your back.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.520
 You know, you have to turn your back on the throw as well.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.680
 So how does it work?

02:22.680 --> 02:24.920
 It's definitely sort of a throw

02:24.920 --> 02:27.960
 where you need to start pulling your opponent's

02:27.960 --> 02:30.480
 upper body towards you, right?

02:30.480 --> 02:32.640
 So their upper body starts coming towards you.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.160
 Your legs go towards them

02:35.160 --> 02:38.440
 as your body starts to go into the throw.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.920
 So your head is gonna go left, let's say.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.640
 Your body, your legs are gonna go to the right.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.360
 Your body's, your partner's gonna start to lean towards you.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.960
 And just as you start to get there

02:48.960 --> 02:50.560
 a moment then coming forward,

02:50.560 --> 02:53.400
 your leg is gonna sweep up underneath theirs,

02:53.400 --> 02:55.280
 pick them up onto your hip, right?

02:55.280 --> 02:57.320
 And then the finish of the throw is a twist.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.280
 And a lot of times the good judoka

02:59.280 --> 03:01.600
 will leave their feet when they do the throw.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.080
 So both bodies are in the air together.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.640
 And then the thrower comes down

03:05.640 --> 03:07.560
 on top of the person being thrown.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.320
 So all four feet are in the air?

03:09.320 --> 03:10.160
 Correct.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.360
 So there's just this unstoppable forces twist.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.480
 So you're all in the air.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.840
 You're basically doing a roll together.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.400
 Correct.

03:17.400 --> 03:21.680
 Okay, so who to you is the best Uchimata?

03:21.680 --> 03:23.680
 Who has besides yourself?

03:23.680 --> 03:25.920
 I'm not gonna lie.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.320
 There's plenty of guys that do Uchimata

03:28.320 --> 03:29.760
 a lot better than I do.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.800
 You do have a nice video about the Uchimata online,

03:31.800 --> 03:36.120
 but who's a great practitioner of the Uchimata to you?

03:36.120 --> 03:37.800
 Right now, Shohei Ono,

03:37.800 --> 03:39.720
 who's two time Olympic gold medalist.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.920
 That's his favorite throw.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.320
 And there's tons of highlight videos on the IGF

03:44.320 --> 03:47.720
 and Judo fanatics showing how he does his Uchimata.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.560
 And it is quite different than everybody else's.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.400
 But it's unstoppable when he comes in, nobody stops it.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.000
 He's won two golds in a row at the Olympics.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.480
 I think maybe in the last eight years,

03:57.480 --> 03:59.320
 the guys lost two matches.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.920
 He's just incredible.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.760
 At a very competitive division,

04:02.760 --> 04:05.080
 I guess seven, you three kilos?

04:05.080 --> 04:05.920
 Okay.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.640
 And then three time world champ too.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.600
 Is he the greatest of all time?

04:10.600 --> 04:11.440
 You?

04:11.440 --> 04:14.000
 The only reason why he's not is because Nomura

04:14.000 --> 04:15.360
 is a 60 kilo player.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.760
 He was three time Olympic champion.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.800
 So Nomura, I mean, unless Ono's gonna stick around

04:20.800 --> 04:25.480
 for another three years and win again in Paris,

04:25.480 --> 04:27.640
 that's, you know, then he'd match what Nomura did.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.800
 But three time gold medalist in Judo

04:29.800 --> 04:33.560
 in a lightweight division, that's pretty spectacular.

04:33.560 --> 04:38.080
 So to you, the being able to win a championship,

04:38.080 --> 04:43.080
 world championship or Olympic medal is a measure of greatness.

04:43.960 --> 04:48.120
 It's not like you have some people who are not as accomplished

04:48.120 --> 04:49.960
 like Koga or something like that,

04:49.960 --> 04:54.960
 but just the beauty, the moments of magic,

04:55.040 --> 04:57.680
 the number of moments of magic is the highest,

04:57.680 --> 04:59.560
 even if it's not championships.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.000
 I think you have to go by that

05:01.000 --> 05:04.080
 because there's so many phenomenal Judo players

05:04.080 --> 05:08.520
 that have come through the system of spectacular Judo.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.600
 You have one countless major events,

05:11.600 --> 05:13.960
 but, you know, the ability to pull it together, right,

05:13.960 --> 05:16.520
 at those magical moments, the pinnacle of the sport,

05:16.520 --> 05:18.760
 the world championships, the Olympic games,

05:18.760 --> 05:21.600
 improving that you can do it time and time again,

05:21.600 --> 05:24.240
 makes you unstoppable, it makes you the best.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.160
 You know, there was a guy back in the 70s and 80s

05:27.160 --> 05:28.480
 by the name of Fuji,

05:28.480 --> 05:32.320
 and he won four world championships back to back.

05:32.320 --> 05:35.080
 And back then the world's was every two years.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.680
 So he was, here he was a four time world champion.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.000
 That's eight years the top of the sport.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.600
 He never won an Olympic medal.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.360
 You know, he never went to the Olympics.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.400
 You know, so there's a guy who missed out

05:47.400 --> 05:48.880
 on Olympic greatness,

05:48.880 --> 05:52.560
 but was arguably the best competitor back in that period.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.760
 By the way, same Fuji as Fuji.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.080
 Right.

05:57.080 --> 05:57.920
 Really?

05:57.920 --> 05:58.760
 Okay.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.640
 Wow, I didn't know that was an actual guy, Fuji.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.240
 Our brand is named after the mountain, Mount Fuji.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.080
 Okay.

06:04.080 --> 06:04.920
 But, you know, this is a different guy,

06:04.920 --> 06:05.760
 his name was Fuji.

06:05.760 --> 06:09.600
 All right, well, history rhymes.

06:10.720 --> 06:14.560
 What about Teddy Reneir, 10 time world champ,

06:14.560 --> 06:17.640
 I think, two time gold medalist at the Olympics,

06:17.640 --> 06:20.560
 two times bronze medalist at the Olympics,

06:22.600 --> 06:26.400
 probably the most dominant Jidoka ever.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.320
 Is he in the running?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.040
 What do you think about that guy?

06:29.040 --> 06:31.920
 I think he's a freak of nature, Teddy.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.560
 You know, if you look at the size, just how big he,

06:34.560 --> 06:36.560
 how tall he is, how big he is,

06:36.560 --> 06:38.640
 how physical he is of a specimen.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.680
 Like I sat next to him on a bus

06:40.680 --> 06:45.680
 and like his legs are literally the size of my waist.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.080
 Like when you sit next to him and just look at the size,

06:48.080 --> 06:49.600
 he's a big man.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.880
 You know, so obviously to win 10 world titles

06:52.880 --> 06:55.120
 in the sport of judo, I mean,

06:55.120 --> 06:58.840
 that's almost an incomprehensible feat,

06:58.840 --> 07:00.080
 two time Olympic champion.

07:00.080 --> 07:04.800
 Again, you know, that puts him in one of the,

07:04.800 --> 07:06.840
 maybe 10 or 12 people that ever do that

07:06.840 --> 07:08.200
 in the history of the sport.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.560
 So he's definitely got to be in the running for the best.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.160
 But, you know, technically,

07:14.160 --> 07:16.680
 I don't think he's as technical as some of the other.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.560
 In terms of pure judo, finesse technique, you know,

07:21.560 --> 07:24.960
 it's, he's powerful, he's explosive, he's dominant.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.880
 He's strong.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.040
 Teddy also grips really, really well,

07:29.040 --> 07:32.400
 which makes him that much tougher to beat.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.200
 Because a lot of times heavyweights,

07:34.200 --> 07:35.120
 especially the heavyweight division,

07:35.120 --> 07:36.720
 a lot of them just grab the gi

07:36.720 --> 07:39.920
 and they go, you know, man to man and judo to judo

07:39.920 --> 07:41.280
 and take shots at each other.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.600
 And that's why a lot of them end up getting beat.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.920
 But Teddy's in control, like positionally,

07:45.920 --> 07:47.880
 he stays in really good position

07:47.880 --> 07:49.920
 and he controls his opponent the whole fight.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.280
 So they really don't have a chance against them.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.160
 He doesn't give them a chance to beat him,

07:54.160 --> 07:55.680
 which is why he's been so dominant.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.440
 But he's not really stalling.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.680
 So I mean, he does have a really nice,

08:01.000 --> 08:05.600
 a sort of gary, this backward trip, outside trip,

08:05.600 --> 08:07.120
 in case people don't know.

08:07.120 --> 08:11.000
 I mean, he has just like technically pretty good throws

08:11.000 --> 08:12.480
 and for heavyweight.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.320
 Yes.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.880
 Heavyweights can be sometimes messy with their judo.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.600
 He's pretty technical and clean

08:21.600 --> 08:24.120
 in the execution of his big throws,

08:24.120 --> 08:26.280
 but a lot of that probably has to do

08:26.280 --> 08:28.360
 with the dominant gripping that he does.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.640
 It's not defensive gripping, it's offensive gripping,

08:30.640 --> 08:32.280
 but the dominant gripping.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.120
 100%.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.040
 He controls the grips, he controls the movement

08:36.040 --> 08:37.920
 of the match as a result of that

08:37.920 --> 08:39.720
 and then he creates his own openings.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.320
 So I mean, for a heavyweight, phenomenal technique, yes.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.400
 And what you said, messy, I'd like to call it sloppy, right?

08:46.400 --> 08:49.480
 A lot of the heavyweights tend to be sloppy.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.520
 They fall on the ground a lot.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.480
 It's hard to move somebody that weighs 350 pounds.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.000
 It's hard to get that body move in

08:56.000 --> 08:58.400
 and just with the simple pull motion.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.920
 So he's definitely found a way to do it,

09:00.920 --> 09:03.600
 but he's also, I don't know, six foot eight.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.480
 He's probably weighs 140 kilos.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.840
 He's a big boy.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.240
 But he had this winning streak of just,

09:10.240 --> 09:13.040
 I don't know how long, but like over a hundred matches.

09:13.960 --> 09:18.120
 And he lost at this Olympics that we just went through the 20,

09:18.120 --> 09:20.320
 I don't even know what to call it, 2021 Olympics.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.840
 I don't know the proper terminology.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.240
 Tokyo 2020 is what they call it.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.280
 Tokyo 2020, all right.

09:26.280 --> 09:30.120
 So he lost to Tamerlan Bashav.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.360
 I mean, it's always sad to see a sort of greatness

09:34.360 --> 09:35.200
 come to an end.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.080
 It's like Karelian in wrestling and Greco Roman.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.120
 Did you shed a bit of a tear to see greatness go?

09:42.120 --> 09:46.480
 Or is it just a way of life?

09:46.480 --> 09:50.520
 I mean, what did you think about sort of this dominance,

09:50.520 --> 09:53.800
 this run of dominance being stopped?

09:53.800 --> 09:56.120
 I think, I mean, it's obviously sad to see,

09:56.120 --> 09:58.480
 I love seeing champions succeed,

09:58.480 --> 10:00.440
 especially people that are good people.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.080
 And I think Teddy's a good person.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.280
 You know, I mean, I think there's some arrogant champions

10:04.280 --> 10:06.120
 that everybody would like to see lose

10:06.120 --> 10:08.480
 just because they don't want to deal with their,

10:08.480 --> 10:10.680
 you know, their personality or,

10:10.680 --> 10:13.760
 but I think Teddy's a very humble champion.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.480
 You know, he's a people's champion.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.840
 You know, he's, I think he's been privileged

10:17.840 --> 10:19.760
 and he makes good money from the sport of judo

10:19.760 --> 10:21.840
 and the French Federation has taken care of him well.

10:21.840 --> 10:25.320
 So he's a lifelong judo icon.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.640
 So it's sad to see somebody like that get beat,

10:27.640 --> 10:29.160
 especially when this could have been, you know,

10:29.160 --> 10:33.680
 his third Olympic title and, you know,

10:33.680 --> 10:36.640
 just put him in infamy, you know.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.720
 So it was sad to see, but I think, you know,

10:39.720 --> 10:42.040
 every athlete goes through it, right?

10:42.040 --> 10:45.600
 I mean, you, it's just, that's what the Olympics is all about.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.560
 The great ones fall sometimes and...

10:48.560 --> 10:53.000
 Especially in judo, it's like so, like the margin of error.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.320
 I mean, I guess the other question I want to ask here is,

10:56.320 --> 11:01.320
 in your sense, how difficult it is to not lose for so long.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.840
 It seems like in judo, like a little mistake and it's over.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.600
 There's no, there's no coming back.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.440
 And Epon means it's over.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.960
 So how difficult is that?

11:12.960 --> 11:15.120
 It's hard to stay that dominant without question.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.720
 First of all, when you are,

11:16.720 --> 11:19.400
 when you are the entire world is training against you,

11:19.400 --> 11:22.880
 just to be, they're studying every single movement.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.320
 They're studying patterns.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.640
 They're trying to break it down and find a flaw in your game.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.360
 So everybody's hunting for you

11:29.360 --> 11:30.360
 when you're the best in the world,

11:30.360 --> 11:32.920
 especially at the Olympics, that's the one to beat you at.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.960
 So everybody's focused on you.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.400
 And then there's an incredible amount of pressure

11:37.400 --> 11:38.720
 on that athlete to perform.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.880
 You know, you carry the flag for your country.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.040
 You know, when you're at opening ceremonies, sometimes,

11:43.040 --> 11:46.720
 you know, there's all spotlight is on you.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.960
 And it's particularly hard when things don't go well early.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.160
 You know, in other words, when you're expected to win,

11:53.160 --> 11:55.600
 and then all of a sudden, now you're in a hard fight

11:55.600 --> 11:57.160
 and it's not going the way you want.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.120
 That pressure, the one who's the favorite,

11:59.120 --> 12:00.960
 feels the pressure the most at the Olympics.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.840
 And that's why I think the other ones are able to win it.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.440
 I've actually never gotten a chance to listen

12:06.440 --> 12:11.440
 to Teddy Reneyre sort of explain ideas behind his judo.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.720
 Like I wonder what his mental game is like,

12:13.720 --> 12:16.800
 because I think his English is pretty not very good.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.760
 And so, and I just haven't seen good interviews,

12:19.760 --> 12:21.520
 but it's always fascinating to,

12:22.520 --> 12:25.400
 there's certain great athletes

12:25.400 --> 12:28.560
 that are also great thinkers and speakers,

12:28.560 --> 12:32.120
 like the Satya brothers in wrestling.

12:32.120 --> 12:35.680
 Again, not many, that's on my to do list, 100%.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.200
 I'm going to Dagestan and talking to them

12:38.200 --> 12:39.640
 because they're brilliant.

12:39.640 --> 12:43.360
 But to be able to sort of, maybe after retirement,

12:43.360 --> 12:46.560
 to think back, what were the systems involved?

12:46.560 --> 12:50.880
 Both on the technical, the training side,

12:50.880 --> 12:53.520
 and then the mental side,

12:53.520 --> 12:55.400
 because like to stay that dominant,

12:55.400 --> 12:56.600
 just like you're saying,

12:56.600 --> 12:58.520
 everybody's studying to beat you.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.280
 And the heavyweights are just these powerful dudes.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.320
 So to be able to control them with your game

13:06.320 --> 13:09.640
 and like the game that everybody knows is coming is,

13:09.640 --> 13:11.760
 I don't know, I don't know what's behind that,

13:11.760 --> 13:13.880
 but there's got to be,

13:13.880 --> 13:17.920
 it feels like the mental game is exceptionally important.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.560
 I think a lot of people underestimate

13:19.560 --> 13:22.200
 just how important that side is.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.200
 Being mentally prepared for victory,

13:24.200 --> 13:27.160
 mentally prepared to be the best, to stay the best.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.440
 There's no way that's weak minded

13:30.440 --> 13:32.520
 that they can accomplish that.

13:32.520 --> 13:36.560
 It's 100% confidence and belief in yourself.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.640
 If we take a big picture of you then,

13:38.640 --> 13:39.960
 not necessarily Taterinaire,

13:39.960 --> 13:42.600
 but if you want to go from the very beginning,

13:42.600 --> 13:47.600
 from day one of Judo class to Olympic champion

13:47.760 --> 13:50.040
 or Olympic medalist,

13:50.040 --> 13:54.160
 what does it take to become an Olympic medalist in Judo

13:54.160 --> 13:56.000
 from start to finish?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.360
 Like how many different trajectories do you see?

13:58.360 --> 14:01.720
 Or is there some unifying principles?

14:01.720 --> 14:03.120
 I think a lot of it has to,

14:03.120 --> 14:06.960
 your journey is going to depend a lot by where you're from.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.080
 So a path that an American might take

14:09.080 --> 14:10.920
 versus somebody who's from Japan

14:10.920 --> 14:12.760
 or somebody who's from Europe.

14:12.760 --> 14:16.640
 There's three very distinct paths, right?

14:16.640 --> 14:19.920
 Because in Japan, it's part of the culture.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.240
 There's a system of excellence.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.600
 There's elementary school Judo,

14:24.600 --> 14:25.920
 there's junior high school,

14:25.920 --> 14:26.760
 there's high school,

14:26.760 --> 14:27.600
 there's collegiate,

14:27.600 --> 14:28.760
 there's Olympic.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.640
 And much like our wrestling is here

14:32.640 --> 14:34.440
 in the United States, right?

14:34.440 --> 14:35.280
 It's very similar.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.480
 There's youth wrestling,

14:36.480 --> 14:37.840
 there's high school,

14:37.840 --> 14:40.200
 there's NCAA and then there's Olympic wrestling.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.960
 And when your country is a factory

14:43.960 --> 14:47.080
 of producing athletes at the highest level,

14:47.080 --> 14:49.640
 then all of those top athletes

14:49.640 --> 14:51.240
 typically go back into the sport

14:51.240 --> 14:52.560
 and there's professions for them.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.960
 They have an opportunity to coach it,

14:53.960 --> 14:55.440
 all those different levels.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.320
 And just the level of their game

14:57.320 --> 14:59.680
 and the expertise that all of them have,

14:59.680 --> 15:01.600
 even down at the elementary level,

15:01.600 --> 15:04.200
 make their skill so solid.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.000
 And as a coach in that situation,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.640
 you can just sit back and watch who stands out

15:09.640 --> 15:12.200
 as opposed to, I think in America, I guess,

15:12.200 --> 15:15.200
 you would need to craft.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.400
 You don't get to choose from a thousand people,

15:17.400 --> 15:21.200
 a few people that naturally stand out at the age of nine.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.840
 You have to actually,

15:22.840 --> 15:26.520
 whatever the natural resources you're given,

15:28.120 --> 15:29.800
 craft them into a champion.

15:30.960 --> 15:34.200
 So if we look at that, the American way,

15:34.200 --> 15:36.280
 where you just have a person with a smile,

15:36.280 --> 15:38.320
 show up to your dojo,

15:38.320 --> 15:41.120
 says I wanted to be an Olympic medalist.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.040
 What process do you take them through?

15:43.040 --> 15:44.840
 The odds are really insurmountable.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.560
 It's a very, very high hill to climb.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.000
 And there's only a few people

15:50.000 --> 15:52.680
 and there's only a few coaches in this entire country

15:52.680 --> 15:55.120
 that really understand that process.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.280
 And they can help people reach that level

15:58.280 --> 16:00.040
 as it's been proven, right?

16:01.240 --> 16:05.080
 Number one, you certainly have to have a solid base,

16:05.080 --> 16:08.240
 a fundamental base of an expectation

16:08.240 --> 16:10.120
 of what the training is gonna be.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.680
 And it has to be a level of professionalism

16:12.680 --> 16:13.760
 very, very early,

16:13.760 --> 16:15.800
 where you're teaching all the basic judo moves,

16:15.800 --> 16:20.520
 all the basic fundamental movements, posture, gripping.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.440
 Well, maybe gripping doesn't come in so early

16:22.440 --> 16:23.280
 in the game,

16:23.280 --> 16:26.600
 but throwing methodology, movements,

16:26.600 --> 16:30.840
 Neuwasa position, standing fundamental throws.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.920
 And I think most importantly is really the work ethic,

16:33.920 --> 16:35.760
 just the way you're gonna train,

16:35.760 --> 16:37.360
 the intensity you're gonna train with,

16:37.360 --> 16:42.400
 the ability to, mindset of going to tournaments constantly,

16:42.400 --> 16:44.320
 in order to compete with the rest of the world,

16:44.320 --> 16:49.320
 our young kids need to be tested a lot when they're young.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.400
 They have to be put through adversity

16:51.400 --> 16:53.240
 because they don't get put through adversity in training

16:53.240 --> 16:55.000
 because you don't have that many good training partners.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.760
 So you get put through adversity in competition

16:57.760 --> 16:59.480
 and then do we see what your weaknesses are

16:59.480 --> 17:02.560
 and we continue to make improvements on those.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.000
 But the journey is, it's long.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.080
 And until they're kind of at the teenage years,

17:08.080 --> 17:10.160
 they're gonna have to pretty much stay domestic, right?

17:10.160 --> 17:12.560
 Cause they got to go through life as a normal kid,

17:12.560 --> 17:14.240
 but they've got to be training in the dojo

17:14.240 --> 17:17.040
 at least five days a week.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.120
 Sometimes they might want to get an extra technical workout

17:20.120 --> 17:23.160
 in or doing some base conditioning in addition to that.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.720
 And then really at the teenage years,

17:24.720 --> 17:28.760
 that's where we really, we've struggled in America

17:28.760 --> 17:31.920
 of keeping teens in the sport of judo,

17:31.920 --> 17:34.560
 as well as developing them properly.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.280
 Cause up until around the teenage years,

17:36.280 --> 17:39.280
 I think the Americans are on par with the rest of the world

17:39.280 --> 17:41.800
 in terms of technique and in terms of skill.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.920
 And then, we've proven we can compete

17:44.920 --> 17:46.600
 with the rest of the world up until that age.

17:46.600 --> 17:50.760
 But that's where Japan and that's where the Europeans

17:50.760 --> 17:52.920
 and the countries that are strong in judo,

17:52.920 --> 17:55.400
 that's where they put a lot of time, energy and effort.

17:55.400 --> 17:59.120
 Is it to the teens where they have a great coaching staff,

17:59.120 --> 18:02.000
 they have good training camps with 800,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.720
 a thousand people going to home every single weekend.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.280
 When you say teens, what do you mean?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.000
 Do you mean literally like 13?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.480
 Yeah, age 13 to 17, 13 to 19.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.680
 And that's when you really accelerate your development.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.760
 So you're saying like in America,

18:17.760 --> 18:20.760
 when you're young, like before, you know,

18:20.760 --> 18:24.360
 nine, 10, 11, 12, you stick in judo,

18:24.360 --> 18:26.160
 you can progress quite a bit.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.960
 But then I guess the other competition there,

18:28.960 --> 18:33.960
 if you're into two people doing stuff to each other

18:36.880 --> 18:39.040
 in a combative way,

18:39.040 --> 18:41.680
 the other competitor in America is wrestling.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.840
 So judo almost primes you,

18:43.840 --> 18:47.600
 like it teaches you how to be a great wrestler as well.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.800
 And so then you have to have a hard decision

18:51.680 --> 18:54.760
 because you can probably be a collegiate wrestler.

18:54.760 --> 18:59.760
 You have like a clear plan of where you're going to go

19:00.040 --> 19:01.040
 if you want to be a wrestler.

19:01.040 --> 19:06.040
 Where judo, that plan is less clear.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.360
 So you have to be on your own a bit with your coach,

19:10.360 --> 19:11.200
 that kind of thing.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.120
 Exactly.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.440
 Okay, so when you're on your own with your coach,

19:14.440 --> 19:16.160
 to me, that's just a fascinating journey

19:16.160 --> 19:19.200
 because then it's just like the purity of it.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.720
 It's a coach and the athlete and the dream.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.560
 It's all about the dedication,

19:24.560 --> 19:27.600
 the five, six, seven days a week,

19:27.600 --> 19:32.600
 competing once a month, twice a month.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.520
 Okay, and just, but also,

19:35.520 --> 19:36.960
 you probably don't have that conversation.

19:36.960 --> 19:37.800
 I don't know if you do.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.400
 Maybe you do saying like,

19:39.400 --> 19:42.280
 we're going to do this for the next eight years.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.600
 Right.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.440
 Do you ever sit down, would you just do it,

19:46.440 --> 19:48.000
 take it the David Goggins way,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.720
 which is like, let's just take it one step at a time.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.080
 Let's hope we're there in eight years.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.200
 Yeah, let's hope we're there.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.040
 Do you like actually?

19:56.040 --> 19:58.200
 Like right now, you have to think about

19:58.200 --> 20:02.040
 the Olympics is going to be in Los Angeles in 2028.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.280
 So it's really interesting.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.640
 Now would be the time and now is the time

20:06.640 --> 20:11.520
 to identify talent and get commitment out of students

20:11.520 --> 20:14.920
 that in seven years, you can make a US Olympic team

20:14.920 --> 20:17.280
 because we're going to have a full team.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.200
 America is going to have 14 athletes compete in those games,

20:20.200 --> 20:21.680
 one in every weight class.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.760
 So now is the time, if you're going to go on a journey

20:23.760 --> 20:26.000
 to the Olympics and stay with the sport of judo,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.480
 now would be the time to do it, you know?

20:28.480 --> 20:33.240
 And so what you show up to the Pedro Judo Center

20:33.240 --> 20:38.240
 and how much drilling, how much technique,

20:38.280 --> 20:41.320
 strategy, discussions, how much randori

20:41.320 --> 20:44.120
 or like live sparring, how much conditioning

20:44.120 --> 20:48.080
 and strength training, how much of all of that?

20:49.240 --> 20:51.280
 How much of cross training to other gyms

20:51.280 --> 20:53.720
 or something like that traveling abroad?

20:53.720 --> 20:56.160
 Is there something to be said about us,

20:56.160 --> 20:57.520
 some aspects of that system?

20:57.520 --> 20:58.640
 For sure.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.400
 You need it all, what you just said,

21:00.400 --> 21:02.200
 we need it all of it and we do do all of that.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.080
 Right now we have a young group of kids at the academy,

21:05.080 --> 21:09.360
 you'll see tonight, some of them are 14, 13, 15, 17.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.200
 Are they good?

21:10.200 --> 21:11.040
 Yeah, really good.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.600
 Okay, can't wait.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.360
 They're right around your waist, so it'll be perfect.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.200
 That's nice.

21:16.880 --> 21:17.800
 They're just young boys,

21:17.800 --> 21:19.640
 but they've been training hard through COVID.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.560
 Yeah.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.800
 We've been, Travis and myself have been training them,

21:23.800 --> 21:26.240
 we share responsibilities.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.680
 They're doing randori like five nights a week,

21:28.680 --> 21:31.480
 you know, we have them doing randori Tuesdays,

21:31.480 --> 21:35.520
 Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays

21:35.520 --> 21:36.520
 is when they're doing randori,

21:36.520 --> 21:38.320
 they're coming to Dojo Friday night and Sunday night

21:38.320 --> 21:39.160
 to do training.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.600
 We also have technical sessions for them,

21:42.600 --> 21:44.640
 they're in school now, so it's a little bit challenging,

21:44.640 --> 21:46.520
 but they come five o clock in the afternoon

21:46.520 --> 21:48.200
 and they do a technical session.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.320
 Through COVID they were coming every morning

21:50.320 --> 21:51.720
 doing technical sessions.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.160
 What's the technical session?

21:53.160 --> 21:56.200
 It's an hour of repetitive throwing

21:56.200 --> 21:59.240
 or repetitive drilling to reinforce movements

21:59.240 --> 22:03.080
 that we deem important to our successful system.

22:03.080 --> 22:06.040
 So Neuaza positions, groundwork positions

22:06.040 --> 22:08.200
 where we want them to be put in this position

22:08.200 --> 22:10.280
 and they're gonna drill it 50 times,

22:10.280 --> 22:12.680
 you know, with resistance in big groups,

22:12.680 --> 22:15.080
 you know, doing drills over and over again,

22:15.080 --> 22:17.320
 picking apart the details of the technique

22:17.320 --> 22:19.920
 and what they're doing wrong, showing them how to fix it.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.360
 But now we've done it so much

22:21.360 --> 22:23.640
 that now we can do a whole drill session with them

22:23.640 --> 22:25.600
 where they know all the different techniques

22:25.600 --> 22:27.200
 inside and out and they can move

22:27.200 --> 22:29.000
 from position to position really quickly.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.800
 Do they do it for a period of time,

22:31.800 --> 22:33.960
 like two minutes, five minutes,

22:33.960 --> 22:37.080
 or is it like one, do they are actually counting?

22:37.080 --> 22:38.760
 No, sometimes it's both.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.240
 So sometimes we do it for reps,

22:40.240 --> 22:42.040
 sometimes we do it for time.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.680
 Yeah, so sometimes it might be as many as they can do

22:44.680 --> 22:48.040
 in 60 seconds or as many as they can do in two minutes

22:48.040 --> 22:49.360
 and sometimes it might just be,

22:49.360 --> 22:51.920
 I want you to do every position five times.

22:51.920 --> 22:55.400
 In terms of throws, we're not talking about on a crash pad,

22:55.400 --> 22:56.520
 right, it's just...

22:56.520 --> 22:58.640
 We're talking about free moving around the mat

22:58.640 --> 23:01.480
 and just dynamically and just throwing.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.320
 Correct.

23:02.320 --> 23:06.840
 How many, because as I was mentioning to you offline,

23:06.840 --> 23:10.080
 Travis threw me a few times, a lot of times

23:10.080 --> 23:11.760
 when he was visiting in Austin.

23:11.760 --> 23:15.040
 And I just remembered, so there's two things.

23:15.040 --> 23:18.400
 I, fortunately or unfortunately in my life,

23:18.400 --> 23:22.320
 having gotten a chance to train with folks of that level,

23:22.320 --> 23:25.200
 with just cleanness of throw and the power.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.520
 And it was very nice.

23:26.520 --> 23:30.000
 I immediately actually enjoyed being thrown like that.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.080
 To throw a little shade at Craig Jones

23:33.080 --> 23:37.240
 with his current mat situation is they're very,

23:37.240 --> 23:41.120
 they were quite thin and as Travis commented on,

23:41.120 --> 23:42.720
 and not just the thinness of the mats,

23:42.720 --> 23:44.880
 but they were laid on like concrete.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.720
 Right.

23:45.720 --> 23:49.200
 So I felt, it's like soft until it's not.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.760
 But being thrown very cleanly,

23:53.760 --> 23:55.000
 I just felt like there's,

23:55.000 --> 23:56.320
 this is not gonna lead to injury.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.160
 It was great.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.000
 It was an injury prone.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.880
 But then as I mentioned to you,

24:00.880 --> 24:04.600
 when I dare to after my entire leg,

24:04.600 --> 24:06.600
 one of them, I guess it's the left leg,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.320
 was just black, bruise.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.640
 It didn't hurt too bad,

24:12.640 --> 24:14.480
 but it was just the body's gotten soft.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.080
 So I guess the question I have is,

24:17.080 --> 24:21.440
 does the body get used to just that number of throws?

24:21.440 --> 24:26.280
 Just over time being thrown thousands of times a month,

24:26.280 --> 24:28.760
 unquestionably, your body gets used to it.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.880
 So it hardens, it gets really hard,

24:30.880 --> 24:33.920
 which is why judo is hard to come back to

24:33.920 --> 24:35.760
 after you've taken a long period of time off

24:35.760 --> 24:39.280
 because your body is not used to that impact anymore.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.520
 I always found out that,

24:40.520 --> 24:42.200
 when I was training judo a lot,

24:42.200 --> 24:46.120
 it's hard to shed weight and keep weight off

24:46.120 --> 24:47.560
 because your body like,

24:47.560 --> 24:51.280
 it develops like this layer of protection on itself

24:51.280 --> 24:53.040
 that it doesn't wanna give up.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.120
 When you're sucking a lot of weight,

24:54.120 --> 24:55.600
 that means you're frail.

24:55.600 --> 24:59.160
 So I always seem to retain weight more,

24:59.160 --> 25:00.560
 when you're doing hard judo training,

25:00.560 --> 25:02.920
 as opposed to losing weight.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.320
 It's easy when you go out for runs and things like that

25:05.320 --> 25:06.600
 to shed the water weight,

25:06.600 --> 25:09.480
 but to actually keep the pounds off was pretty hard.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.000
 Yeah, the body kind of develops,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.800
 like you said, a level of protection.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.440
 What about the Randori, just out of curiosity,

25:15.440 --> 25:18.320
 again, I haven't ever had the opportunity

25:18.320 --> 25:20.380
 to train with folks at a high level.

25:20.380 --> 25:25.380
 In Jiu Jitsu, there's different gyms at different styles,

25:26.580 --> 25:29.140
 but I've noticed that at the highest levels,

25:29.140 --> 25:33.180
 people can go pretty hard in a certain kind of way

25:33.180 --> 25:35.460
 where it's more technical,

25:35.460 --> 25:39.540
 and you're moving at 100%,

25:39.540 --> 25:43.580
 but the power is not at 100%.

25:43.580 --> 25:45.540
 It's a weird little dance.

25:45.540 --> 25:50.540
 It's like you're not really forcing stuff.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.860
 You're more focused on the right timing,

25:53.860 --> 25:58.140
 the right positioning of hands and feet and body

25:58.140 --> 25:59.140
 and all those kinds of things.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.820
 You're not like forcing stuff in the way you would

26:01.820 --> 26:04.140
 in competition, like really the power.

26:04.140 --> 26:05.580
 Does that sound similar to you

26:05.580 --> 26:07.240
 for the way you tried to do Randori?

26:07.240 --> 26:08.900
 So there's different styles of judo,

26:08.900 --> 26:10.780
 and to say the Japanese style,

26:10.780 --> 26:12.180
 the technical style of judo

26:12.180 --> 26:13.780
 is exactly what you just talked about.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.340
 It's almost like two guys in pajamas, right?

26:16.340 --> 26:20.740
 We're not using minimal effort, maximum efficiency.

26:20.740 --> 26:23.700
 We're moving around and we're trying to feel that movement

26:23.700 --> 26:25.980
 and it's timing and finesse and technique

26:25.980 --> 26:28.100
 and fun and clean throws.

26:28.100 --> 26:30.860
 And when you train in Japan,

26:30.860 --> 26:33.740
 you can train 15 rounds of Randori,

26:33.740 --> 26:38.660
 five minute rounds, that's 75 minutes of straight sparring.

26:38.660 --> 26:41.540
 You can do that straight in Japan without a problem.

26:41.540 --> 26:42.860
 I mean, you'll get tired, of course,

26:42.860 --> 26:45.780
 you're gonna fall a lot, you're gonna throw a lot,

26:45.780 --> 26:48.140
 but it's a very like free feeling.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.380
 And it's technical as you explained.

26:50.380 --> 26:51.900
 But then when you go to Europe

26:51.900 --> 26:53.900
 and you try to do rounds with the Europeans,

26:53.900 --> 26:55.220
 they are very physical.

26:55.220 --> 26:58.980
 They don't have that same finesse in their training

26:58.980 --> 27:00.340
 that they do in Japan.

27:00.340 --> 27:02.220
 And in Europe, you'd be hard pressed

27:02.220 --> 27:04.340
 to do eight rounds of Randori in a night.

27:04.340 --> 27:06.420
 It's so physically exhausting

27:06.420 --> 27:09.500
 because so much effort is going into just fighting

27:09.500 --> 27:11.500
 and fending off the gripping system

27:11.500 --> 27:13.580
 and the power of your opponent,

27:13.580 --> 27:16.300
 you're physically drained after eight rounds of Randori.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.380
 So it's a much different feel.

27:18.380 --> 27:21.620
 When you say Europe, do you mean Germany, France,

27:21.620 --> 27:23.900
 Britain, Russia, is there a lot?

27:23.900 --> 27:27.060
 So there's a kind of similarity

27:27.060 --> 27:28.860
 to all of those kinds of approaches.

27:28.860 --> 27:30.100
 The only difference would be Russia

27:30.100 --> 27:32.860
 that they do a lot more active drilling,

27:32.860 --> 27:35.500
 a lot more sequential movement training.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.980
 They don't focus as much on Randori.

27:37.980 --> 27:42.500
 You'll do much fewer rounds in Russia during training camps

27:42.500 --> 27:44.220
 than you would in those other countries

27:44.220 --> 27:46.820
 we just talked about, France, Germany, et cetera.

27:46.820 --> 27:48.940
 What about in this kind of American system

27:48.940 --> 27:53.420
 where you have much less talent to work with?

27:53.420 --> 27:58.420
 Do you just select whatever works

27:59.020 --> 28:00.100
 for the particular athletes?

28:00.100 --> 28:03.620
 Do you have something you prefer in your system?

28:03.620 --> 28:05.540
 So you need a combination of all of it.

28:05.540 --> 28:06.980
 If you're gonna win at the Olympic level,

28:06.980 --> 28:09.220
 you have to be able to deal with the finesse

28:09.220 --> 28:12.380
 of the Japanese, the physicality of the Europeans.

28:12.380 --> 28:15.620
 You have to focus on the ground, Neuwasa aspect,

28:15.620 --> 28:17.260
 because a lot of people are weak there

28:17.260 --> 28:18.780
 in the world of the sport of judo.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.420
 That's a chance to win.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.940
 We've sort of developed our American system of judo,

28:22.940 --> 28:26.420
 at least for the last, I'd say probably the last 20 years

28:26.420 --> 28:27.980
 it'd be the American system of judo,

28:27.980 --> 28:31.660
 which relies heavily on taking the individual

28:31.660 --> 28:34.100
 and whatever techniques they do,

28:34.100 --> 28:37.820
 perfecting those techniques and the combinations

28:37.820 --> 28:40.100
 and other throws that go with those throws,

28:40.100 --> 28:43.220
 but then implementing and overlaying an American system

28:43.220 --> 28:47.700
 of gripping, Neuwasa, conditioning, mentality,

28:47.700 --> 28:51.580
 training methodology, like in game planning,

28:51.580 --> 28:52.620
 to beat your opponents.

28:52.620 --> 28:55.660
 And I think that's the secret sauce to success

28:55.660 --> 28:58.420
 for Americans, because there's no way,

28:58.420 --> 29:01.020
 if we don't have eight partners to train with in a night

29:01.020 --> 29:02.740
 that are gonna give us good rounds, right?

29:02.740 --> 29:05.340
 We might have two, so we're gonna have the same guy

29:05.340 --> 29:07.940
 four times, those two people four, two times each.

29:07.940 --> 29:10.260
 Now I have four good rounds, the rest of the rounds,

29:10.260 --> 29:11.580
 I'm not being pushed to the limit.

29:11.580 --> 29:12.900
 So we train differently.

29:14.220 --> 29:17.220
 And a lot of times we do a lot of stuff like shark bait.

29:17.220 --> 29:19.300
 When our athletes are preparing for competition,

29:19.300 --> 29:22.020
 for example, when Kayla or Travis were preparing

29:22.020 --> 29:25.060
 for competition, we might only have 20 people

29:25.060 --> 29:28.100
 in the whole gym to work out with those two

29:28.100 --> 29:29.300
 Olympic medalists, right?

29:29.300 --> 29:32.020
 And of those 20 people, maybe four of them

29:32.020 --> 29:35.300
 are Travis's size, maybe there's only one girl

29:35.300 --> 29:37.500
 in the room for Kayla, she's gotta train with guys.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.900
 And then the other ones are teenagers that are too weak

29:39.900 --> 29:41.460
 to train with either one of them.

29:41.460 --> 29:44.140
 So what we would do is just put together four or five people

29:44.140 --> 29:47.460
 that could give them a challenge and we'd line them up

29:47.460 --> 29:49.740
 and they would do a minute, a minute, a minute, a minute,

29:49.740 --> 29:52.580
 and they'd do five minutes in a row as hard as they can.

29:52.580 --> 29:55.500
 That person can go hard for a minute with Travis or Kayla.

29:55.500 --> 29:56.820
 They can't go five minutes hard,

29:56.820 --> 29:58.260
 but they can go one minute hard.

29:58.260 --> 30:01.740
 So it made their training much more intense,

30:01.740 --> 30:03.340
 much more physically demanding.

30:03.340 --> 30:06.180
 And then rinse and repeat that six times

30:06.180 --> 30:08.260
 or eight times in a night,

30:08.260 --> 30:10.700
 they just got 40 minutes of intense randori,

30:10.700 --> 30:13.300
 the person that was training with them that wasn't as good,

30:13.300 --> 30:14.580
 only had to do six or eight minutes

30:14.580 --> 30:16.260
 of training the whole night, you know?

30:16.260 --> 30:20.500
 So it's so difficult.

30:20.500 --> 30:24.100
 Cause then you look at like the Russian national team

30:24.100 --> 30:31.100
 and you have just the world champions and so,

30:33.580 --> 30:37.220
 or you even have like, what is the Tom Brands

30:37.220 --> 30:39.700
 and Terry Brands in the wrestling system?

30:39.700 --> 30:43.100
 You have like these people, it's a small group of people,

30:43.100 --> 30:45.740
 but they're all some of the best people in the world

30:45.740 --> 30:47.540
 and they're going head to head.

30:47.540 --> 30:49.980
 And yeah, you don't necessarily get a good look

30:49.980 --> 30:55.140
 kind of a variety of styles, but just the quality is there.

30:55.140 --> 30:58.660
 And even that is missing for people your size in America.

30:58.660 --> 31:02.380
 Cause that is so difficult to work with,

31:02.380 --> 31:05.540
 which it makes Galas and makes Travis's story

31:05.540 --> 31:07.300
 that much more amazing.

31:07.300 --> 31:10.540
 Is you mentioned kind of picking whatever

31:10.540 --> 31:14.700
 the set of techniques the athlete is naturally good at

31:14.700 --> 31:19.740
 or prefers or whatever, how much specialization is there?

31:19.740 --> 31:21.620
 Maybe if I give you like two choices,

31:21.620 --> 31:25.100
 is it good to have like one throw

31:25.100 --> 31:26.980
 and try to become the best person in the world

31:26.980 --> 31:27.940
 at that throw?

31:27.940 --> 31:30.020
 Or do you want to have a bunch of stuff?

31:31.020 --> 31:32.980
 Like a variety of throws?

31:32.980 --> 31:34.740
 Well, for Travis, it was Epon Sainaghi.

31:34.740 --> 31:36.460
 That was his main throw, right?

31:36.460 --> 31:38.380
 But from that Epon Sainaghi,

31:38.380 --> 31:41.140
 he had a variety of other attacks he could do,

31:41.140 --> 31:42.340
 you know, that mixed it up

31:42.340 --> 31:44.340
 so that you kept people guessing.

31:44.340 --> 31:46.220
 Maybe it wasn't the Epon say we was coming.

31:46.220 --> 31:48.420
 Maybe it was the Koshy Groomer that he did.

31:48.420 --> 31:50.220
 Or maybe it was the Epon to Osoro

31:50.220 --> 31:51.420
 that he did in combination.

31:51.420 --> 31:55.060
 So you typically have one main throw that you do.

31:55.060 --> 31:56.820
 For me, it was Tai Otoshi.

31:56.820 --> 31:58.820
 For Kayla, it was her Ogoshi.

31:58.820 --> 32:01.180
 For Travis, it was his Epon Sainaghi.

32:01.180 --> 32:04.100
 But then you come up with a variety of other throws

32:04.100 --> 32:06.380
 that you do from the very same grip.

32:06.380 --> 32:08.340
 So whatever grip you take for your main throw,

32:08.340 --> 32:11.620
 you want to develop, you know, an arsenal of attacks

32:11.620 --> 32:13.340
 that go in all different directions,

32:13.340 --> 32:15.060
 holding that same grip.

32:15.060 --> 32:18.260
 So you keep your opponent guessing as to what's coming.

32:18.260 --> 32:20.900
 You know, because if they're just sitting on one technique

32:20.900 --> 32:22.300
 at the highest level of sport,

32:22.300 --> 32:23.780
 with the exception of a few, right?

32:23.780 --> 32:26.180
 We talked about Ono's Uchimada.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.460
 With the exception of a few,

32:27.460 --> 32:29.500
 most of the world catches on pretty quick

32:29.500 --> 32:30.860
 on how to beat you.

32:30.860 --> 32:33.060
 There is something to just thinking,

32:33.060 --> 32:36.260
 making sure you really dedicate to the main thing.

32:36.260 --> 32:39.700
 So for Travis, that would be like the main version

32:39.700 --> 32:41.420
 of his Sainaghi.

32:41.420 --> 32:43.900
 Like really making sure you don't forget

32:43.900 --> 32:46.220
 to really put in the time on that.

32:46.220 --> 32:51.220
 Because I mean, one way to say it is

32:51.900 --> 32:55.940
 that threat being dangerous opens up a lot of things.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.180
 Right.

32:57.180 --> 32:59.260
 But also, I don't know.

33:00.780 --> 33:02.540
 I think I'm just, as a fan,

33:02.540 --> 33:06.740
 I think it's sad when like elite level athletes

33:06.740 --> 33:09.300
 in all like combat sports

33:09.300 --> 33:11.700
 kind of start taking their main thing for granted.

33:11.700 --> 33:16.540
 Like they think, okay, I've figured that part out.

33:16.540 --> 33:18.660
 Now I'll be working on all this whole system

33:18.660 --> 33:20.820
 on variations, on different setups,

33:20.820 --> 33:24.900
 on lefty versus some like weird variation.

33:24.900 --> 33:27.180
 As opposed to, you know what?

33:27.180 --> 33:29.380
 If you look at some of the best people ever,

33:29.380 --> 33:32.860
 they seem to have not cared about variations at all.

33:32.860 --> 33:34.860
 They're just like literally,

33:34.860 --> 33:37.740
 they are more like Girodreams of Sushi.

33:37.740 --> 33:42.460
 And like fine tuning their ear,

33:42.460 --> 33:45.620
 their ability to detect the minute movements

33:45.620 --> 33:48.220
 that give you an opening on that main thing.

33:48.220 --> 33:52.700
 And so the whole time, you're just waiting for that throw.

33:52.700 --> 33:55.900
 You're like dancing with the like little bit of pressure

33:55.900 --> 33:58.580
 and then like releasing the pressure and putting the pressure.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.620
 Maybe a little bit off balance

34:00.620 --> 34:03.900
 and finding like the right moment to strike

34:03.900 --> 34:05.420
 and focusing on that.

34:05.420 --> 34:08.140
 Again, maybe that's just like a romanticization

34:08.140 --> 34:10.940
 of like the simplicity of that.

34:10.940 --> 34:13.940
 Maybe it is kind of impossible to do that on a large scale,

34:13.940 --> 34:18.940
 but I just, yeah, I don't know if you can comment on that,

34:19.940 --> 34:22.820
 whether there is some value in still putting in like tens

34:22.820 --> 34:25.420
 of thousands of reps on the main, main thing.

34:25.420 --> 34:27.820
 Well, unquestionably, that has to happen.

34:27.820 --> 34:30.060
 You still have to drill your main throw

34:30.060 --> 34:32.540
 and you have to fine tune it and continue to do,

34:32.540 --> 34:34.300
 you know, repetition after repetition

34:34.300 --> 34:36.020
 and throws on the crash pad, you know,

34:36.020 --> 34:37.740
 or throws on the mat, moving around,

34:37.740 --> 34:40.100
 just explosive movements doing your main technique.

34:40.100 --> 34:41.260
 You're never gonna forget that

34:41.260 --> 34:43.020
 and you're not gonna put it to the side

34:43.020 --> 34:44.100
 and not practice it anymore.

34:44.100 --> 34:46.140
 It still has to be part of your repertoire

34:46.140 --> 34:47.820
 and part of your daily training,

34:47.820 --> 34:49.660
 but you do have to evolve.

34:49.660 --> 34:52.500
 And I think that's, and I think that's the sport of judo

34:52.500 --> 34:54.100
 makes you evolve.

34:54.100 --> 34:54.940
 You know, when I look at,

34:54.940 --> 34:56.860
 we talked about Koga from before, right?

34:56.860 --> 34:57.700
 And we talked about,

34:57.700 --> 34:59.700
 he had a dynamic keep on saying Aggie

34:59.700 --> 35:01.900
 that nobody could stop for years and years and years.

35:01.900 --> 35:05.020
 But when people started to, you know, be on orthodox

35:05.020 --> 35:07.500
 and come down his back and cross grip him

35:07.500 --> 35:09.500
 and he couldn't get to the lapel,

35:09.500 --> 35:10.900
 he had to come up with something else.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.820
 And all of a sudden you saw Koga doing,

35:12.820 --> 35:15.660
 now he did a Sode or now he did a Tomoi Nagi,

35:15.660 --> 35:18.220
 which so he can, he added to his arsenal,

35:18.220 --> 35:20.420
 you know, to keep people thinking, keep people guessing.

35:20.420 --> 35:22.740
 So it's not, you're not just that one trick pony.

35:22.740 --> 35:25.180
 They still couldn't stop his Ipon saying Aggie

35:25.180 --> 35:26.780
 once he got that grip.

35:26.780 --> 35:28.660
 But if they stopped him from getting that grip

35:28.660 --> 35:30.380
 or putting two hands on the gi,

35:30.380 --> 35:31.700
 he had to go to something else.

35:31.700 --> 35:32.940
 And that's what he did.

35:32.940 --> 35:36.660
 Does Travis's or Koga's saying Aggie makes sense to you?

35:36.660 --> 35:38.820
 That weird, so when I,

35:38.820 --> 35:41.220
 Split hip, split hip, split hip.

35:41.220 --> 35:43.700
 So I don't know if you know this,

35:43.700 --> 35:45.620
 but like I got into judo because of Travis.

35:45.620 --> 35:47.300
 I watched him at 2008 Olympics.

35:47.300 --> 35:50.220
 And I was, there's something about like,

35:50.220 --> 35:51.940
 just not the cockiness,

35:51.940 --> 35:55.420
 but the confidence and just the refusal to quit,

35:55.420 --> 35:57.620
 the refusal to just some, that energy,

35:57.620 --> 35:59.220
 whatever it connected with me is like,

35:59.220 --> 36:01.100
 oh, that guy's badass.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.060
 I want to be badass like that.

36:03.060 --> 36:04.820
 And then I also, there happened to be

36:04.820 --> 36:06.580
 in my university judo and I,

36:07.740 --> 36:09.460
 and I got into it and just fell in love

36:09.460 --> 36:10.620
 with the elegance and the beauty

36:10.620 --> 36:11.980
 and the power of the sport.

36:13.540 --> 36:18.540
 But also I started to mimic Travis's game, his and Koga's.

36:18.900 --> 36:21.900
 And I, and then the instructors I worked with,

36:21.900 --> 36:24.340
 they said, that's the wrong way to do it.

36:24.340 --> 36:28.420
 And I always, I never found somebody that told me like,

36:28.420 --> 36:29.740
 no, that's not the wrong way to do it.

36:29.740 --> 36:31.180
 There's a lot of ways to do it.

36:31.180 --> 36:32.780
 And there's like the classic way

36:32.780 --> 36:34.460
 and you have to understand it and you have to learn it,

36:34.460 --> 36:36.100
 but this is not the wrong way.

36:36.100 --> 36:37.620
 Cause I was trying to find somebody

36:37.620 --> 36:39.180
 who understands this throw.

36:40.020 --> 36:42.460
 Cause it was so beautiful at the highest level,

36:42.460 --> 36:45.060
 especially with Koga, the way you're able,

36:45.060 --> 36:47.020
 the quickness with which you can strike,

36:47.020 --> 36:48.780
 the fact that you can stand on the feet

36:48.780 --> 36:50.860
 and the elevation you can get

36:50.860 --> 36:52.220
 and the power you can get.

36:52.220 --> 36:57.220
 It has certain throws, just like Uchimara

36:57.220 --> 36:59.020
 doesn't look powerful.

36:59.020 --> 37:02.460
 It just like, it's, it looks effortless,

37:02.460 --> 37:06.820
 but like the standing Sainaghi with a split hip,

37:06.820 --> 37:10.300
 it just looks powerful because there's a,

37:10.300 --> 37:12.620
 you're like, you're stepping into them,

37:12.620 --> 37:14.820
 you're lifting the opponent and they still have,

37:14.820 --> 37:17.260
 they're not surprised, they're now like helpless.

37:17.260 --> 37:18.620
 Right, they're feeling a fluttering in the air.

37:18.620 --> 37:19.460
 A fluttering.

37:19.460 --> 37:22.020
 So, and then there's just this pause

37:22.020 --> 37:25.380
 and then just big slam, Uchimara it's almost like,

37:25.380 --> 37:27.620
 you don't know what hit you.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.060
 It's like Taito, she's the same.

37:29.060 --> 37:30.900
 It's almost like a surprise, like, oh shit,

37:30.900 --> 37:32.220
 I'm not on my back.

37:32.220 --> 37:37.220
 And so I just, I just love that throw

37:37.220 --> 37:40.420
 but like, it didn't make sense to me.

37:40.420 --> 37:42.940
 Like when trying to explain it to others,

37:42.940 --> 37:45.420
 when trying to learn, it didn't make sense to me

37:45.420 --> 37:47.460
 how it works, does it make sense to you?

37:47.460 --> 37:48.300
 It does.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.180
 I was born a judoka, right?

37:50.180 --> 37:54.540
 So I've lived this stuff since I was an infant

37:54.540 --> 37:58.220
 and I've seen every style and every technique.

37:58.220 --> 38:01.020
 The split hip, say, in Aigi is difficult to learn.

38:01.020 --> 38:03.980
 It's harder to learn than the basic form,

38:03.980 --> 38:08.060
 but it is powerful and it does, upon entry,

38:08.060 --> 38:10.460
 both your opponent's feet leave them at at the same time.

38:10.460 --> 38:11.300
 So you've got them.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.700
 Once you enter, you've got them,

38:12.700 --> 38:13.860
 you just gotta finish, right?

38:13.860 --> 38:15.380
 You just gotta lock them and turn and go.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.220
 So it makes sense to me.

38:17.220 --> 38:20.060
 My dad did teach me how to do that when I was younger.

38:20.060 --> 38:21.460
 Yeah, he wanted me to do a split hip.

38:21.460 --> 38:23.380
 We have kids at the school today

38:23.380 --> 38:26.100
 that we teach the split hip, say, in Aigi, same way.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.580
 Because it is that dynamic, right?

38:28.580 --> 38:31.420
 You don't drop to the ground and roll and turn.

38:31.420 --> 38:32.980
 It's not the classic form

38:32.980 --> 38:34.300
 where you're giving way to your opponent.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.700
 It's actually, you go pick the guy up in the air

38:36.700 --> 38:37.980
 and then you slam him, so.

38:39.140 --> 38:41.900
 Okay, beautiful.

38:41.900 --> 38:44.020
 So maybe on a small tangent,

38:44.020 --> 38:46.420
 so where we're talking about elite level athletes

38:46.420 --> 38:50.220
 in terms of Rondori, in terms of like drilling

38:50.220 --> 38:53.020
 for more recreational athletes,

38:53.020 --> 38:56.420
 like I have personally that situation going on,

38:56.420 --> 38:57.420
 but there's other people,

38:57.420 --> 39:00.100
 they're just recreationally training Judo.

39:00.100 --> 39:03.220
 How do you recommend they improve Judo?

39:03.220 --> 39:06.460
 Like if I wanted to compete a bunch

39:06.460 --> 39:10.140
 and do reasonable with a particular set of throws,

39:10.140 --> 39:13.620
 say the split, say in Aigi,

39:13.620 --> 39:16.340
 so how do you do the Rondori?

39:16.340 --> 39:18.620
 Do you use a crash pad to get in reps?

39:18.620 --> 39:20.340
 Do you like, what do you recommend?

39:20.340 --> 39:22.900
 So I guess there's two recreational people

39:22.900 --> 39:23.740
 that we're talking about.

39:23.740 --> 39:25.860
 One is somebody who wants to learn Judo

39:25.860 --> 39:27.420
 and become good at Judo,

39:27.420 --> 39:29.620
 but doesn't necessarily want to compete,

39:29.620 --> 39:30.620
 but just wants to get better.

39:30.620 --> 39:33.460
 And I think there's not enough emphasis

39:33.460 --> 39:37.940
 in this country on paying attention to that type of student.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.100
 Everybody pushes them to competition,

39:40.100 --> 39:43.380
 but in reality, there's a huge audience of people out there

39:43.380 --> 39:44.820
 that would love to learn Judo

39:44.820 --> 39:46.740
 and be very proficient at Judo

39:46.740 --> 39:50.060
 and have the skills to go execute if they haven't needed it.

39:50.060 --> 39:52.860
 And there's a class and there should be a program

39:52.860 --> 39:53.740
 for that athlete.

39:53.740 --> 39:56.540
 And that athlete does not need to do Rondori.

39:56.540 --> 39:59.060
 Like the sport of Judo is physical enough

39:59.060 --> 40:00.940
 when you're picking somebody up all the time

40:00.940 --> 40:03.700
 and moving their body weight around them at all the time,

40:03.700 --> 40:05.780
 where you can get very physically strong,

40:05.780 --> 40:07.340
 very physically fit.

40:07.340 --> 40:09.220
 Technically, you'll be better than somebody

40:09.220 --> 40:11.900
 that does Rondori more than you

40:11.900 --> 40:14.300
 because if you learn good technique

40:14.300 --> 40:16.380
 and you learn the movement and you learn the feel

40:16.380 --> 40:18.700
 and you learn the timing,

40:18.700 --> 40:20.220
 you'll actually be a better athlete

40:20.220 --> 40:22.260
 than the person that just focuses on Rondori

40:22.260 --> 40:24.740
 who does ugly technique and wins with force.

40:24.740 --> 40:28.700
 So, you know, we have a recreational class at our school

40:28.700 --> 40:30.180
 where they don't do any Rondori.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.620
 They have an option afterwards

40:31.620 --> 40:34.140
 if they want to stay for 15 minutes or stay for 30 minutes

40:34.140 --> 40:36.220
 where they can participate in Rondori,

40:36.220 --> 40:39.100
 but most of the adult students choose not to

40:39.100 --> 40:41.700
 because they're already so tired from the other,

40:41.700 --> 40:43.020
 you know, hour class.

40:43.020 --> 40:44.540
 Right, they're already dripping sweat.

40:44.540 --> 40:48.540
 They're already like, if you work hard and drill hard,

40:48.540 --> 40:51.140
 it's an intense workout, you're exhausted.

40:51.140 --> 40:55.820
 You know, so that's a specific set of a program,

40:55.820 --> 40:57.180
 I should say at every academy.

40:57.180 --> 41:01.700
 And then if you want to get good and you want to compete,

41:01.700 --> 41:04.540
 then to me, once you have your techniques,

41:04.540 --> 41:09.340
 it's learning how to implement a good gripping system

41:09.340 --> 41:11.340
 to put yourself in a position

41:11.340 --> 41:14.660
 where you can always, you know, dominate the grips,

41:14.660 --> 41:19.460
 control the movement, initiate the reactions

41:19.460 --> 41:20.300
 from your opponent,

41:20.300 --> 41:22.580
 and then have the opportunity to attack and score.

41:22.580 --> 41:25.460
 And I think that when people train with,

41:25.460 --> 41:29.100
 or when they jump into a higher level of the sport of judo,

41:29.100 --> 41:31.140
 all of a sudden the first thing they say is,

41:31.140 --> 41:33.420
 I can't attack, I don't know how to attack

41:33.420 --> 41:36.460
 because positionally, they don't know where to put their hands.

41:36.460 --> 41:38.820
 They don't know how to hold the gi properly.

41:38.820 --> 41:41.180
 They don't understand that they're, you know,

41:41.180 --> 41:43.020
 they have an inferior grip

41:43.020 --> 41:45.460
 and they don't know how to get into better position

41:45.460 --> 41:46.340
 so they can attack.

41:46.340 --> 41:47.580
 And that's a big part of the game

41:47.580 --> 41:49.740
 that not a lot of people really understand.

41:49.740 --> 41:52.740
 So you really, even for recreational competitors,

41:52.740 --> 41:54.860
 you really need to have a gripping system.

41:54.860 --> 41:57.180
 You need to understand the gripping system.

41:57.180 --> 41:58.540
 If you want to win.

41:58.540 --> 41:59.380
 Yeah.

41:59.380 --> 42:00.660
 I mean, if the goal is to go and compete,

42:00.660 --> 42:01.900
 that's a different story.

42:01.900 --> 42:04.780
 I don't have fun getting beat up or losing in competitions.

42:04.780 --> 42:06.940
 I enjoy the...

42:06.940 --> 42:09.020
 I don't even know if it's the winner or the losing.

42:09.020 --> 42:13.180
 I think this is what, because I competed a lot

42:13.180 --> 42:15.820
 in both Judo and Jiu Jitsu and in Judo,

42:16.820 --> 42:19.900
 it feels like, because I didn't have a gripping system,

42:19.900 --> 42:21.820
 it feels like you're not even playing Judo

42:21.820 --> 42:24.380
 against the good black belts.

42:24.380 --> 42:26.300
 You're, they're just, they're not,

42:26.300 --> 42:28.100
 they're not even trying because they have,

42:28.100 --> 42:29.740
 they get a certain kind of grip

42:29.740 --> 42:31.260
 and you just can't do anything.

42:31.260 --> 42:33.060
 And I don't have a good answer for that.

42:33.060 --> 42:34.820
 I don't even know what I'm looking for.

42:34.820 --> 42:36.100
 And so it's not even fun.

42:36.100 --> 42:37.700
 It's not like even losing.

42:37.700 --> 42:40.620
 It's like, I don't know.

42:40.620 --> 42:43.420
 It's like you didn't even show up to play

42:43.420 --> 42:44.580
 is what it feels like.

42:44.580 --> 42:45.420
 And it's unfortunate.

42:45.420 --> 42:49.940
 And I think that is a big gap in knowledge actually

42:49.940 --> 42:54.940
 in Judo schools is the gripping part.

42:55.660 --> 42:58.980
 When you first go out to do Judo, right?

42:58.980 --> 43:00.260
 You, the first thing you have to do

43:00.260 --> 43:01.820
 is you have to grab your opponent, right?

43:01.820 --> 43:03.980
 And a lot of times I hear coaches say, get a grip.

43:03.980 --> 43:04.820
 Just take a grip.

43:04.820 --> 43:07.180
 Well, sometimes if you take a grip,

43:07.180 --> 43:10.380
 you're in a worse position than not having a grip at all.

43:10.380 --> 43:11.860
 And that's what a lot of people don't understand.

43:11.860 --> 43:14.300
 Like if you hold the gi in the wrong way,

43:14.300 --> 43:16.860
 your opponent can attack you, but you can't attack him.

43:16.860 --> 43:19.220
 So why would you ever do that grip

43:20.300 --> 43:22.780
 if it's only to your detriment, right?

43:22.780 --> 43:26.780
 So that's, and the way you grip does set up

43:26.780 --> 43:28.300
 what attacks you can do as well.

43:28.300 --> 43:29.580
 So that is a huge part.

43:29.580 --> 43:32.620
 And I'm not saying that you have to be 100% disciplined

43:32.620 --> 43:34.380
 and always outgrip your opponent

43:34.380 --> 43:36.060
 and only be able to do throws

43:36.060 --> 43:37.100
 when you have a superior grip.

43:37.100 --> 43:40.260
 I'm just saying that to be able to put the grips together

43:40.260 --> 43:42.060
 with the throws and understand the movements

43:42.060 --> 43:44.900
 is gonna make you that much ahead of the game.

43:44.900 --> 43:48.340
 So if we take a step to our previous discussion

43:48.340 --> 43:51.700
 of going from zero to hero.

43:51.700 --> 43:55.700
 So going from the early days through the teenage years

43:55.700 --> 43:58.420
 to winning an Olympic medal.

43:58.420 --> 44:00.780
 So we mentioned a lot of training,

44:00.780 --> 44:03.780
 the dedication of the training, the competing,

44:03.780 --> 44:04.980
 what other elements are there?

44:04.980 --> 44:07.860
 The mental side is visualization,

44:07.860 --> 44:12.540
 believing that you could perform at that level.

44:12.540 --> 44:13.660
 So what else can you say about that?

44:13.660 --> 44:15.140
 I think that comes at the highest level,

44:15.140 --> 44:17.180
 the visualization and the success

44:17.180 --> 44:18.340
 that comes at the highest level.

44:18.340 --> 44:20.460
 I think in the teen years,

44:21.700 --> 44:24.740
 there's the experience plays a huge role

44:24.740 --> 44:28.100
 in getting to train with other people.

44:28.100 --> 44:30.820
 Like as Americans, we have to go train in Europe.

44:30.820 --> 44:33.060
 We have to feel the European style of judo.

44:33.060 --> 44:35.620
 We have to understand that physicality.

44:35.620 --> 44:37.940
 They grip very differently.

44:37.940 --> 44:40.980
 They put you in very unorthodox positions.

44:40.980 --> 44:43.620
 And if you don't know how to deal with that,

44:43.620 --> 44:45.340
 you get thrown before you even have a chance

44:45.340 --> 44:47.060
 to try your own throws.

44:47.060 --> 44:50.380
 So it takes a lot of that experience

44:50.380 --> 44:52.660
 and understanding what's going on.

44:52.660 --> 44:55.020
 And then you also need to get that physicality.

44:55.020 --> 44:59.140
 You need to be strong and hard, I would say,

44:59.140 --> 45:01.500
 by doing all those rounds with the Europeans.

45:01.500 --> 45:03.460
 And at the same time, you need to go to Asia,

45:03.460 --> 45:05.220
 you need to train in Japan

45:05.220 --> 45:08.660
 because you need to feel that free flowing judo

45:08.660 --> 45:10.700
 for your technical side.

45:10.700 --> 45:12.540
 And I think that's one of the things

45:12.540 --> 45:13.820
 that I was able to benefit from.

45:13.820 --> 45:15.020
 My dad was a coach who said,

45:15.020 --> 45:17.860
 listen, I've taken you as far as I can take you.

45:17.860 --> 45:19.660
 I want you to go to the next level.

45:19.660 --> 45:22.980
 I want, you know, he sent me to England with Neil Adams,

45:22.980 --> 45:24.540
 who was an Olympic silver medalist

45:24.540 --> 45:27.020
 and was a world champion, had a great ground game

45:27.020 --> 45:29.420
 and was good at gripping and actually did Taiotoshi,

45:29.420 --> 45:30.420
 which is the throw I did.

45:30.420 --> 45:32.460
 So I said, I want you to go learn from Neil.

45:32.460 --> 45:34.740
 And I ended up going to England,

45:34.740 --> 45:36.580
 probably eight to 10 times in my career

45:36.580 --> 45:38.220
 and spending a good amount of time there

45:38.220 --> 45:40.620
 training at the Neil Adams Academy.

45:40.620 --> 45:42.980
 He's now the voice of judo, Neil Adams.

45:42.980 --> 45:43.900
 What do you make of that guy?

45:43.900 --> 45:44.860
 Just a brief pause.

45:44.860 --> 45:48.460
 He's like Morgan Freeman is the voice

45:48.460 --> 45:50.140
 of like March of the Penguins

45:50.140 --> 45:52.140
 and any other nature documentary.

45:52.140 --> 45:54.780
 And Neil Adams, there's very few sports

45:54.780 --> 45:56.340
 that have a Neil Adams, I would say,

45:56.340 --> 46:00.820
 because he's legitimately maybe like Joe Rogan

46:00.820 --> 46:02.780
 is that from mixed martial arts.

46:02.780 --> 46:06.260
 It's just like an exceptionally recognizable voice.

46:06.260 --> 46:07.900
 He's really knowledgeable.

46:07.900 --> 46:10.460
 Also the passion is conveyed so well.

46:10.460 --> 46:13.500
 Like many times I'll watch just because he's talking.

46:13.500 --> 46:14.540
 So who is he?

46:14.540 --> 46:16.580
 Since you got the chance to train with him

46:16.580 --> 46:18.700
 to learn from him, who's Neil Adams?

46:18.700 --> 46:20.180
 He's a great friend of mine.

46:20.180 --> 46:21.020
 He is.

46:21.020 --> 46:21.860
 He's a mentor.

46:23.340 --> 46:24.900
 Like I said, I lived and trained

46:24.900 --> 46:27.620
 at the Neil Adams Club in Coventry, England

46:27.620 --> 46:29.820
 since I was like 16 years old.

46:29.820 --> 46:31.820
 I went and visited him for the first time.

46:31.820 --> 46:33.340
 He's the one who originally taught me

46:33.340 --> 46:37.260
 how to do Jujigatami in the way that I do Jujigatami.

46:37.260 --> 46:38.100
 I trained with him.

46:38.100 --> 46:39.460
 He was just retired.

46:39.460 --> 46:41.740
 He was in his early 30s when I first went out there.

46:41.740 --> 46:43.860
 And so I trained with him many times.

46:43.860 --> 46:48.860
 And over the years, he was a mentor, great person,

46:48.860 --> 46:54.060
 cares about people, cares about the sport of judo.

46:54.060 --> 46:56.860
 Had a good little club that was a fitness club.

46:56.860 --> 47:01.860
 And it was judo, it was fitness, it used to go there.

47:01.860 --> 47:04.460
 I'd show up at that place at like seven in the morning.

47:04.460 --> 47:06.460
 And the first thing we would do is we'd go for a run.

47:06.460 --> 47:08.460
 And we'd either be running mountains,

47:08.460 --> 47:10.460
 or we'd be doing a five mile run,

47:10.460 --> 47:12.460
 or we'd be doing something at the park.

47:12.460 --> 47:15.060
 We were doing sprints and buddy carries and all this stuff.

47:15.060 --> 47:17.460
 And then at 9 a.m., we'd have a technical session

47:17.460 --> 47:20.260
 with Neil Adams, where he would, for an hour and a half,

47:20.260 --> 47:22.660
 we would drill techniques and learn positions.

47:22.660 --> 47:24.260
 And it was no randori.

47:24.260 --> 47:25.860
 It was that sequential drilling

47:25.860 --> 47:27.260
 that we talked about before, right?

47:27.260 --> 47:31.060
 Where you're reinforcing your two or three attacks

47:31.060 --> 47:32.260
 to set up your main attack.

47:32.260 --> 47:33.660
 Or if you're on the ground,

47:33.660 --> 47:36.260
 you're going through repetitions of certain movements.

47:37.260 --> 47:41.060
 And then I'd spend all afternoon at the club, have lunch.

47:41.060 --> 47:44.660
 I'd go do my weight training in the afternoon at that place.

47:44.660 --> 47:45.660
 And then in the evening,

47:45.660 --> 47:48.660
 we would either do randori training at the Neil Adams Club,

47:48.660 --> 47:52.660
 or we'd all get in a car and we'd drive to another location.

47:52.660 --> 47:55.660
 And we'd go train at another club that might be an hour away.

47:55.660 --> 47:57.660
 And there'd be 50 bodies there to train with.

47:57.660 --> 47:59.660
 And each night, we'd go to a different dojo.

47:59.660 --> 48:01.660
 And so it would be all day at the club.

48:01.660 --> 48:03.660
 And I'd do that for like three weeks straight.

48:03.660 --> 48:05.660
 All we do is train.

48:05.660 --> 48:07.660
 Do you know how he became the voice of Judo?

48:07.660 --> 48:11.660
 Do you have an understanding of what he's thinking

48:11.660 --> 48:14.660
 is around how much he dedicates to himself

48:14.660 --> 48:17.660
 to just commentating on Judo?

48:17.660 --> 48:20.660
 I imagine the amount of research required,

48:20.660 --> 48:22.660
 but also just like psychologically,

48:22.660 --> 48:24.660
 just the excitement he has in his voice,

48:24.660 --> 48:27.660
 it takes work to do that.

48:27.660 --> 48:30.660
 Do you have an understanding of like what his vision is with that?

48:30.660 --> 48:34.660
 He's always been a very charismatic, animated person, Neil.

48:34.660 --> 48:37.660
 Very passionate and loud and funny.

48:37.660 --> 48:39.660
 And the Brits are very funny to begin with.

48:39.660 --> 48:42.660
 So he's very charismatic.

48:42.660 --> 48:46.660
 But I think after coaching, he tried coaching.

48:46.660 --> 48:48.660
 He coached the country of Wales for a while.

48:48.660 --> 48:50.660
 He tried coaching Stints in other countries.

48:50.660 --> 48:53.660
 He didn't have a lot of success on the coaching side

48:53.660 --> 48:55.660
 developing an Olympic champion.

48:55.660 --> 48:57.660
 I know that was a goal of his,

48:57.660 --> 48:59.660
 that he was a world champion.

48:59.660 --> 49:00.660
 I think it was 1981.

49:00.660 --> 49:04.660
 He won two silver medals in the Olympic Games himself.

49:04.660 --> 49:07.660
 He went on to coach for a while

49:07.660 --> 49:11.660
 and had some political issues with the country of England for a while.

49:11.660 --> 49:13.660
 And then left England and went to Wales.

49:13.660 --> 49:16.660
 And I think he had a coach in Stints somewhere else as well.

49:16.660 --> 49:20.660
 Didn't have a lot of success coaching in the sport with athletes,

49:20.660 --> 49:21.660
 not at the highest level.

49:21.660 --> 49:23.660
 Had a great national team and things like that.

49:23.660 --> 49:26.660
 He was really good at teaching his technique to others

49:26.660 --> 49:29.660
 because he helped me a lot.

49:29.660 --> 49:32.660
 But running a program, I think was difficult for him.

49:32.660 --> 49:35.660
 The boys not listening and not having that same kind of passion

49:35.660 --> 49:36.660
 and intensity that he,

49:36.660 --> 49:40.660
 and that's why I bonded well with him because I was all in.

49:40.660 --> 49:42.660
 I went there and whatever he said, I did.

49:42.660 --> 49:44.660
 I didn't care how hard, I didn't care how long.

49:44.660 --> 49:46.660
 I just wanted to get as good as I could.

49:46.660 --> 49:49.660
 And so that's why he was a good mentor for me.

49:49.660 --> 49:54.660
 But now in terms of a commentator, he's very cerebral.

49:54.660 --> 49:56.660
 He loves Judo.

49:56.660 --> 49:59.660
 He researches it nonstop.

49:59.660 --> 50:01.660
 He's got that great voice

50:01.660 --> 50:04.660
 and he knows how to bring life to the game.

50:04.660 --> 50:05.660
 And that's what he's done.

50:05.660 --> 50:07.660
 And now this is who he is.

50:07.660 --> 50:09.660
 He does Judo full time.

50:09.660 --> 50:10.660
 This is his job.

50:10.660 --> 50:14.660
 Can I ask you a small before we return to the actual sport,

50:14.660 --> 50:16.660
 the coaching and the sport?

50:16.660 --> 50:18.660
 It's a bit of a political question.

50:18.660 --> 50:20.660
 I did a whole rant before a Travis episode.

50:20.660 --> 50:25.660
 I love Neil Adams voice.

50:25.660 --> 50:27.660
 I love watching Judo.

50:27.660 --> 50:32.660
 And it's really disappointing to me that the IOC

50:32.660 --> 50:34.660
 and whoever is responsible,

50:34.660 --> 50:36.660
 I don't understand this,

50:36.660 --> 50:40.660
 that they don't make it easy for people to watch the Olympics

50:40.660 --> 50:43.660
 in replay for years after.

50:43.660 --> 50:46.660
 I can't watch Travis's matches.

50:46.660 --> 50:50.660
 They make it very difficult to watch stuff online.

50:50.660 --> 50:52.660
 So what happened is,

50:52.660 --> 50:55.660
 I uploaded the Travis Stevens episode

50:55.660 --> 50:58.660
 and we talked about his Ole Bischoff 2012 match.

50:58.660 --> 51:04.660
 And it was like one minute of a small overlay of the videos.

51:04.660 --> 51:07.660
 We're talking through it, like stepping through it.

51:07.660 --> 51:10.660
 And it got taken down immediately from YouTube,

51:10.660 --> 51:13.660
 the whole four hour conversation

51:13.660 --> 51:16.660
 because of that one minute little clip.

51:16.660 --> 51:19.660
 And the way it got taken down automatically

51:19.660 --> 51:24.660
 is because the IOC has that video uploaded.

51:24.660 --> 51:26.660
 It's set to private, but it's uploaded.

51:26.660 --> 51:30.660
 So like they have the video and they choose not to show it.

51:30.660 --> 51:32.660
 It's not that they're asking for money or whatever.

51:32.660 --> 51:34.660
 They're just not showing it anywhere.

51:34.660 --> 51:36.660
 They're not showing it through their own service,

51:36.660 --> 51:38.660
 like NBC Olympics or so on.

51:38.660 --> 51:41.660
 There's just so many great human stories

51:41.660 --> 51:43.660
 that the Olympics reveals.

51:43.660 --> 51:45.660
 They're just not made easily accessible.

51:45.660 --> 51:47.660
 That's the Olympics Charter.

51:47.660 --> 51:52.660
 You want to, I think the actual line is

51:52.660 --> 51:54.660
 to ensure the fullest coverage

51:54.660 --> 51:56.660
 and the widest possible audience in the world

51:56.660 --> 51:58.660
 for the Olympic Games.

51:58.660 --> 52:01.660
 And it seems like to me as a fan of the Olympic Games

52:01.660 --> 52:03.660
 we're not getting any of that.

52:03.660 --> 52:07.660
 Do you have an understanding of why that is?

52:07.660 --> 52:10.660
 Like why we can't watch Kayla's matches,

52:10.660 --> 52:12.660
 Travis's matches super easily,

52:12.660 --> 52:14.660
 even if we're willing to pay money for it.

52:14.660 --> 52:17.660
 So you can't go on the International Judo Federation website

52:17.660 --> 52:20.660
 right now and watch any of the Olympic footage?

52:20.660 --> 52:23.660
 No, no, no.

52:23.660 --> 52:26.660
 So the only thing they have is for certain,

52:26.660 --> 52:29.660
 for example, Teddy Renier match he lost.

52:29.660 --> 52:31.660
 Not available anywhere.

52:31.660 --> 52:33.660
 And that's like a dramatic thing.

52:33.660 --> 52:36.660
 So the one thing they have is for certain sports

52:36.660 --> 52:38.660
 at the highest level, like gymnastics,

52:38.660 --> 52:40.660
 they'll have a highlight,

52:40.660 --> 52:43.660
 which is the most frustrating thing to me.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.660
 Because this is what I can't,

52:45.660 --> 52:49.660
 I'm going to try to prevent myself from going on the rant,

52:49.660 --> 52:54.660
 but people don't just want to see

52:54.660 --> 52:58.660
 a two minute highlight of a historic moment.

52:58.660 --> 53:01.660
 They want to see the buildup where the athlete is standing,

53:01.660 --> 53:03.660
 the nerves, the fear, the confidence.

53:03.660 --> 53:05.660
 You see the buildup to the event,

53:05.660 --> 53:08.660
 say it's a gymnastic, whatever, floor routine.

53:08.660 --> 53:11.660
 Like their name is announced, they're walking,

53:11.660 --> 53:13.660
 the coach, then they cut to the coach,

53:13.660 --> 53:15.660
 and the coach with anticipation,

53:15.660 --> 53:16.660
 and then go to the athlete.

53:16.660 --> 53:18.660
 You want the full 10 minute thing.

53:18.660 --> 53:20.660
 You don't want a two minute highlight

53:20.660 --> 53:23.660
 of what happened like last second or whatever.

53:23.660 --> 53:27.660
 It's just like the magic of that full story.

53:27.660 --> 53:30.660
 Like a lifetime building up to those 10 minutes.

53:30.660 --> 53:33.660
 That's the magic of the Olympics,

53:33.660 --> 53:35.660
 that both the drama and the triumph

53:35.660 --> 53:36.660
 that happens in those moments,

53:36.660 --> 53:39.660
 and the fact that you can't relive that.

53:39.660 --> 53:42.660
 Travis had a bunch of those.

53:42.660 --> 53:45.660
 He had a bunch of times he faced world champions,

53:45.660 --> 53:50.660
 he won and lost, and it's always close, it's always dramatic.

53:50.660 --> 53:52.660
 And none of those are available,

53:52.660 --> 53:58.660
 except like maybe the one where you'd be arm barred,

53:58.660 --> 54:01.660
 or whatever the submission was, I forgot.

54:01.660 --> 54:03.660
 The Georgian.

54:03.660 --> 54:04.660
 Yeah, the Georgian.

54:04.660 --> 54:06.660
 But most things are not.

54:06.660 --> 54:09.660
 Usain Bolt, the full races,

54:09.660 --> 54:12.660
 not all of his races are available online.

54:12.660 --> 54:18.660
 The race with the Italian winning the 100 meter track race,

54:18.660 --> 54:21.660
 this Olympics is not only a highlight,

54:21.660 --> 54:24.660
 that is available from what I saw, I didn't look too hard.

54:24.660 --> 54:27.660
 But the fact that it's not super easily accessible,

54:27.660 --> 54:29.660
 if you're willing to pay money even,

54:29.660 --> 54:31.660
 but probably should be for free,

54:31.660 --> 54:32.660
 is heartbreaking to me,

54:32.660 --> 54:39.660
 because to me the Olympics is like some of the best of humanity.

54:39.660 --> 54:42.660
 Just like, again, the hardship they have to overcome,

54:42.660 --> 54:44.660
 so like the losses are really powerful,

54:44.660 --> 54:46.660
 because it's such a heartbreak,

54:46.660 --> 54:48.660
 but it's also like the triumph.

54:48.660 --> 54:50.660
 Where you're losing history.

54:50.660 --> 54:52.660
 You're losing history is what you are,

54:52.660 --> 54:55.660
 of all the magical moments of your sport.

54:55.660 --> 54:58.660
 It's a sin.

54:58.660 --> 55:03.660
 I got to blame it on television rights and money.

55:03.660 --> 55:04.660
 It's what it comes down to.

55:04.660 --> 55:06.660
 You're talking billions and billions of dollars

55:06.660 --> 55:10.660
 of television rights paid by NBC here in the United States,

55:10.660 --> 55:13.660
 and globally whatever the main carriers are,

55:13.660 --> 55:15.660
 and all the other nations that are dictating

55:15.660 --> 55:17.660
 what can be replayed and what can't.

55:17.660 --> 55:19.660
 And that's what it comes down to.

55:19.660 --> 55:24.660
 I made a DVD or a video

55:24.660 --> 55:26.660
 when I first retired from the sport.

55:26.660 --> 55:27.660
 It was called Fury on the Mat.

55:27.660 --> 55:28.660
 It was kind of my story, right?

55:28.660 --> 55:32.660
 And I did it with a friend who was a videographer,

55:32.660 --> 55:34.660
 and we grabbed a bunch of my old footage,

55:34.660 --> 55:37.660
 an Olympic footage, and somebody said to me,

55:37.660 --> 55:39.660
 you can't use that Olympic footage.

55:39.660 --> 55:41.660
 And I was young and I had just retired.

55:41.660 --> 55:43.660
 I said, what do you mean I can't use the Olympic footage?

55:43.660 --> 55:45.660
 It's not the television footage.

55:45.660 --> 55:47.660
 It's my buddy who filmed it with his own camera.

55:47.660 --> 55:48.660
 It's my footage.

55:48.660 --> 55:49.660
 Exactly.

55:49.660 --> 55:51.660
 And they said, no, if it has Olympics in it,

55:51.660 --> 55:52.660
 or it's anything to do with the Olympics,

55:52.660 --> 55:54.660
 the USOC owns it.

55:54.660 --> 55:56.660
 I said, okay, well, they said,

55:56.660 --> 55:57.660
 well, you should get to send it to them

55:57.660 --> 55:59.660
 and let them review it.

55:59.660 --> 56:02.660
 So I sent it to them and I got a bill back.

56:02.660 --> 56:03.660
 I got a thing back that said,

56:03.660 --> 56:04.660
 if you want to use this footage,

56:04.660 --> 56:06.660
 it's going to be like $30,000.

56:06.660 --> 56:08.660
 And I said, man, it's only like three minutes.

56:08.660 --> 56:10.660
 I spliced it up as much as I could

56:10.660 --> 56:12.660
 and I only have highlights in there.

56:12.660 --> 56:13.660
 And then I said, come on.

56:13.660 --> 56:16.660
 I went back and I negotiated with them.

56:16.660 --> 56:19.660
 But at the end of the day, I still had to pay like $15,000

56:19.660 --> 56:22.660
 just to have a few minutes of footage in my own film.

56:22.660 --> 56:24.660
 This is you.

56:24.660 --> 56:26.660
 You wouldn't even have that film

56:26.660 --> 56:27.660
 if I didn't compete in it.

56:27.660 --> 56:29.660
 You know, like, you can't, you know,

56:29.660 --> 56:31.660
 so it was a struggle.

56:31.660 --> 56:34.660
 This is the different, like you have the same in Jiu Jitsu,

56:34.660 --> 56:36.660
 there's certain organizations, IBJJF,

56:36.660 --> 56:39.660
 or like Flow Grappling and Flow Wrestling.

56:39.660 --> 56:42.660
 I understand, I think, when it's a business,

56:42.660 --> 56:44.660
 it might make sense.

56:44.660 --> 56:46.660
 First of all, you should actually be good

56:46.660 --> 56:48.660
 at being a business and making money,

56:48.660 --> 56:51.660
 which is why, for me, the IOC doesn't make sense.

56:51.660 --> 56:54.660
 Like, it should be accessible, but it would cost money.

56:54.660 --> 56:57.660
 If the index, I can't buy it.

56:57.660 --> 57:00.660
 Like, what I have to email them for this footage

57:00.660 --> 57:02.660
 and pay $30,000?

57:02.660 --> 57:06.660
 But the question is, like, the way you run a business

57:06.660 --> 57:08.660
 is you make that frictionalness.

57:08.660 --> 57:11.660
 Whatever the money is, $30,000 or $30.

57:11.660 --> 57:13.660
 You make it frictionless and easy to pay that money.

57:13.660 --> 57:16.660
 But anyway, I understand why that might be

57:16.660 --> 57:18.660
 the case with Flow Grappling,

57:18.660 --> 57:20.660
 but to me, the Olympics is a special thing.

57:20.660 --> 57:21.660
 For sure.

57:21.660 --> 57:23.660
 It's like you said, it is history.

57:23.660 --> 57:25.660
 Like, there's not even, like,

57:25.660 --> 57:27.660
 even the world championships don't compare.

57:27.660 --> 57:29.660
 I understand they're really important,

57:29.660 --> 57:31.660
 but Olympics is history,

57:31.660 --> 57:36.660
 and the stories should certainly belong to the athletes

57:36.660 --> 57:39.660
 if they want to do, like, fear in the mat

57:39.660 --> 57:41.660
 to do their own story,

57:41.660 --> 57:45.660
 like on a podcast to talk about the most tragic moment

57:45.660 --> 57:47.660
 of their career.

57:47.660 --> 57:51.660
 Do you have a sense of how that could be fixed?

57:51.660 --> 57:54.660
 Or no?

57:54.660 --> 57:56.660
 The only thing I could think of is, you know,

57:56.660 --> 57:58.660
 you'd have to go to the Olympic Committee.

57:58.660 --> 58:00.660
 The US Olympic Committee is the place I would start

58:00.660 --> 58:02.660
 because the US controls the worldwide market

58:02.660 --> 58:04.660
 when it comes to television.

58:04.660 --> 58:06.660
 We pay the most for our television rights.

58:06.660 --> 58:09.660
 Our sponsors pay the most for their rights

58:09.660 --> 58:11.660
 to be associated with the best team in the world,

58:11.660 --> 58:13.660
 which is the United States, right?

58:13.660 --> 58:15.660
 So all the money starts here.

58:15.660 --> 58:18.660
 I got to believe there has to be a way to get that footage

58:18.660 --> 58:21.660
 that should be accessible to the sports themselves.

58:21.660 --> 58:23.660
 I'm surprised it's not,

58:23.660 --> 58:26.660
 but if it's not, then it's because of dollars.

58:26.660 --> 58:28.660
 You know, it's because people aren't...

58:28.660 --> 58:31.660
 The sport itself is not willing to pay enough money

58:31.660 --> 58:34.660
 to have it on its, you know, accessible to its audience.

58:34.660 --> 58:35.660
 Yeah.

58:35.660 --> 58:38.660
 It's too cost prohibitive for them to do it.

58:38.660 --> 58:40.660
 No, but I think it's also, unfortunately,

58:40.660 --> 58:42.660
 it might be some mixture of incompetence

58:42.660 --> 58:44.660
 and just an old way of doing things

58:44.660 --> 58:48.660
 because there's a lot of money to be made on television rights

58:48.660 --> 58:52.660
 where you, like, live show the event, right?

58:52.660 --> 58:54.660
 But what's not being leveraged

58:54.660 --> 58:57.660
 is the huge amount of money that could be made on the replay.

58:57.660 --> 58:59.660
 This is what people don't understand,

58:59.660 --> 59:02.660
 is do you know how many times...

59:02.660 --> 59:05.660
 Just the tens of millions of times

59:05.660 --> 59:09.660
 that people watch individual events years from now.

59:09.660 --> 59:11.660
 You watch, like, all the videos on YouTube,

59:11.660 --> 59:13.660
 they're still getting plays,

59:13.660 --> 59:15.660
 hundreds of millions of views on stuff that happened

59:15.660 --> 59:17.660
 10 years ago, 15 years ago.

59:17.660 --> 59:18.660
 That's really powerful,

59:18.660 --> 59:21.660
 and there's a lot of opportunity to make a ton of money.

59:21.660 --> 59:24.660
 So it's not that they're necessarily greedy.

59:24.660 --> 59:27.660
 They're also just not good at being greedy.

59:27.660 --> 59:28.660
 No, I get what you're saying.

59:28.660 --> 59:29.660
 Yeah, it's not the tradition.

59:29.660 --> 59:30.660
 You know, think about it, though.

59:30.660 --> 59:33.660
 It's not traditional, right, for television studios.

59:33.660 --> 59:36.660
 It's nontraditional to go to online streaming,

59:36.660 --> 59:39.660
 to, you know, online access to information.

59:39.660 --> 59:41.660
 It's not hard, right, because everybody's doing it now,

59:41.660 --> 59:44.660
 but it's not typical.

59:44.660 --> 59:45.660
 Yeah.

59:45.660 --> 59:49.660
 So it requires for the IOC to operate

59:49.660 --> 59:50.660
 outside their comfort zone.

59:50.660 --> 59:52.660
 Well, I definitely hope that's the case.

59:52.660 --> 59:58.660
 And since Travis's video got taken down,

59:58.660 --> 59:59.660
 it's obvious they have it.

59:59.660 --> 1:00:01.660
 They have it on their YouTube channel.

1:00:01.660 --> 1:00:06.660
 So it's like, I hope that they will just release it

1:00:06.660 --> 1:00:09.660
 and for money, for whatever, but release it

1:00:09.660 --> 1:00:15.660
 and have that history not be erased, right?

1:00:15.660 --> 1:00:17.660
 It'd be wonderful if athletes could buy,

1:00:17.660 --> 1:00:19.660
 even if you could buy your own footage.

1:00:19.660 --> 1:00:20.660
 You can't use it commercially.

1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:23.660
 You can't, but you can buy your own matches

1:00:23.660 --> 1:00:25.660
 and have them available for yourself

1:00:25.660 --> 1:00:30.660
 or package the footage to be awesome.

1:00:30.660 --> 1:00:31.660
 Thank you for that.

1:00:31.660 --> 1:00:33.660
 It is quite heartbreaking for me.

1:00:33.660 --> 1:00:37.660
 So I wanted to talk about it a little bit.

1:00:37.660 --> 1:00:40.660
 Let's go to you as an athlete real quick.

1:00:40.660 --> 1:00:41.660
 Sure.

1:00:41.660 --> 1:00:45.660
 You represented the United States at four Olympics,

1:00:45.660 --> 1:00:48.660
 winning a bronze medal at two of them.

1:00:48.660 --> 1:00:52.660
 Who or what was the toughest match or moment

1:00:52.660 --> 1:00:54.660
 you had in those years?

1:00:54.660 --> 1:00:57.660
 Maybe a moment that defined you,

1:00:57.660 --> 1:01:05.660
 that you remember as being particularly defining in your career.

1:01:05.660 --> 1:01:10.660
 I would say the bronze medal match in Atlanta in 96,

1:01:10.660 --> 1:01:12.660
 because up to that moment,

1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:15.660
 the United States team had not won a medal,

1:01:15.660 --> 1:01:17.660
 had not fought for a medal in the games.

1:01:17.660 --> 1:01:19.660
 We were on a home turf.

1:01:19.660 --> 1:01:21.660
 It was my second Olympic Games, right?

1:01:21.660 --> 1:01:24.660
 So I had competed in 92 and I had won two matches

1:01:24.660 --> 1:01:27.660
 and lost in the third round in Barcelona.

1:01:27.660 --> 1:01:29.660
 I didn't make the podium.

1:01:29.660 --> 1:01:32.660
 I lost to a Japanese guy from Japan.

1:01:32.660 --> 1:01:35.660
 But the gold, silver, and bronze medalists

1:01:35.660 --> 1:01:37.660
 at that Olympics in Barcelona

1:01:37.660 --> 1:01:39.660
 were all guys that I had beat.

1:01:39.660 --> 1:01:41.660
 In fact, two of them I was undefeated against

1:01:41.660 --> 1:01:43.660
 in my entire career, the Brazilian and the Cuban

1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:44.660
 I had never lost to.

1:01:44.660 --> 1:01:47.660
 So that's when I knew I was capable of being,

1:01:47.660 --> 1:01:49.660
 you know, on the podium at the Olympic Games.

1:01:49.660 --> 1:01:53.660
 When 96 came around, I was 25 years old.

1:01:53.660 --> 1:01:55.660
 I was fairly in my prime.

1:01:55.660 --> 1:01:57.660
 I had lived in Japan for six months.

1:01:57.660 --> 1:01:59.660
 My technique was at a high level.

1:01:59.660 --> 1:02:02.660
 You know, I was, you know, amongst the best in the world.

1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:07.660
 I lost at that Olympics to a guy from Mongolia.

1:02:07.660 --> 1:02:09.660
 It was right before the match.

1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:11.660
 I was supposed to fight against Japan.

1:02:11.660 --> 1:02:13.660
 So I was like anticipating the match against Japan

1:02:13.660 --> 1:02:15.660
 and I got beat by the Mongolian.

1:02:15.660 --> 1:02:17.660
 So that was kind of a letdown.

1:02:17.660 --> 1:02:20.660
 But the match for the bronze, you know,

1:02:20.660 --> 1:02:22.660
 in front of the hometown crowd,

1:02:22.660 --> 1:02:25.660
 family, all of my friends, everybody who had ever helped me

1:02:25.660 --> 1:02:28.660
 in the sport were in the stands that day,

1:02:28.660 --> 1:02:31.660
 including all my teammates at Brown University

1:02:31.660 --> 1:02:33.660
 that were on the wrestling team and little,

1:02:33.660 --> 1:02:37.660
 my uncles, my aunts, everybody was in the stands, right?

1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:39.660
 So it was like the Jimmy Pedro day.

1:02:39.660 --> 1:02:43.660
 And I'm getting goosebumps right now talking about it.

1:02:43.660 --> 1:02:45.660
 But it was a match against the Brazilian

1:02:45.660 --> 1:02:46.660
 for the bronze medal.

1:02:46.660 --> 1:02:50.660
 I had beaten the Brazilian like two or three times before that.

1:02:50.660 --> 1:02:53.660
 I found myself, I found myself down in the match.

1:02:53.660 --> 1:02:55.660
 He actually countered me.

1:02:55.660 --> 1:02:57.660
 I came in my Tao Toshi and he was waiting for it

1:02:57.660 --> 1:03:00.660
 and he counted me and he scored a yuko against me.

1:03:00.660 --> 1:03:02.660
 So I was losing the fight, came down

1:03:02.660 --> 1:03:04.660
 to about the last minute in the match

1:03:04.660 --> 1:03:06.660
 and I was just tucking in my gi

1:03:06.660 --> 1:03:09.660
 and fixing my thing and gathering my thoughts together

1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:12.660
 and the whole crowd just started chanting,

1:03:12.660 --> 1:03:15.660
 USA, USA, USA.

1:03:15.660 --> 1:03:18.660
 And I like literally like got so much energy.

1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:20.660
 I walked out there, I grabbed the guy,

1:03:20.660 --> 1:03:22.660
 I came in my Tao Tosh again.

1:03:22.660 --> 1:03:23.660
 He stepped off the Tao Tosh.

1:03:23.660 --> 1:03:26.660
 I threw him with Duchi Mada free pound.

1:03:26.660 --> 1:03:31.660
 I won my first Olympic medal in front of the hometown crowd.

1:03:31.660 --> 1:03:33.660
 Everybody went bananas.

1:03:33.660 --> 1:03:35.660
 You know, the United States judo team

1:03:35.660 --> 1:03:37.660
 had our first medal from the Olympics.

1:03:37.660 --> 1:03:39.660
 It ended up being the only Olympic medal

1:03:39.660 --> 1:03:42.660
 we won at that games, but it was like a magical moment

1:03:42.660 --> 1:03:45.660
 to define my career and solidified myself

1:03:45.660 --> 1:03:47.660
 in like history where hey, and now I get to step up

1:03:47.660 --> 1:03:50.660
 on the Olympic podium and I'm Olympic medalist.

1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:53.660
 And to me, that was my defining moment.

1:03:53.660 --> 1:03:55.660
 And after that, I was sold.

1:03:55.660 --> 1:03:57.660
 Like, man, I had to go back to the Olympics again.

1:03:57.660 --> 1:03:58.660
 I want to win a gold medal.

1:03:58.660 --> 1:03:59.660
 I want to do that.

1:03:59.660 --> 1:04:01.660
 I want this feeling all over again.

1:04:01.660 --> 1:04:03.660
 I don't care if I have to wait four years.

1:04:03.660 --> 1:04:04.660
 Let's do it.

1:04:04.660 --> 1:04:08.660
 In your career, like moments like that,

1:04:08.660 --> 1:04:14.660
 do you think you love winning or hate losing more?

1:04:14.660 --> 1:04:19.660
 Did you live for those moments or are you more driven

1:04:19.660 --> 1:04:23.660
 by just how much you hate losing?

1:04:23.660 --> 1:04:25.660
 So in order to be a champion,

1:04:25.660 --> 1:04:30.660
 my belief is that you have to hate losing more than you like winning.

1:04:30.660 --> 1:04:32.660
 Hate losing more than you like winning.

1:04:32.660 --> 1:04:36.660
 But I live for those moments when you do win.

1:04:36.660 --> 1:04:38.660
 And what excited me the most in my career

1:04:38.660 --> 1:04:43.660
 when I was competing was I loved being in the finals.

1:04:43.660 --> 1:04:45.660
 I love the spotlight being on me.

1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:48.660
 I can't think of too many times in my career.

1:04:48.660 --> 1:04:49.660
 Of course, there were a few,

1:04:49.660 --> 1:04:53.660
 but there weren't too many times where the chips were down,

1:04:53.660 --> 1:04:56.660
 like the lights were on and I didn't win.

1:04:56.660 --> 1:04:59.660
 Like it was, I might have lost early in the day

1:04:59.660 --> 1:05:00.660
 and didn't make it to the finals

1:05:00.660 --> 1:05:02.660
 or didn't make it to the medal rounds.

1:05:02.660 --> 1:05:05.660
 But like in my career, I have a ton of golds.

1:05:05.660 --> 1:05:10.660
 I have a ton of bronzes, which means the lights are on and I won.

1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:13.660
 And I have very few silvers and very few fifths.

1:05:13.660 --> 1:05:15.660
 So I either lost in the early rounds

1:05:15.660 --> 1:05:17.660
 and it didn't make to the medal rounds in my younger days

1:05:17.660 --> 1:05:20.660
 or the spotlight came and I really shined.

1:05:20.660 --> 1:05:22.660
 Because if you look, I don't know how many silvers,

1:05:22.660 --> 1:05:25.660
 but there wasn't very many silver medals in my career that I won.

1:05:25.660 --> 1:05:26.660
 You know what I mean?

1:05:26.660 --> 1:05:28.660
 So I just loved that moment.

1:05:28.660 --> 1:05:29.660
 I didn't feel pressure.

1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:30.660
 I love the crowd.

1:05:30.660 --> 1:05:32.660
 I love being in the spotlight.

1:05:32.660 --> 1:05:35.660
 I wasn't nervous when it came to the finals

1:05:35.660 --> 1:05:37.660
 or I knew I was getting a medal.

1:05:37.660 --> 1:05:38.660
 It didn't matter.

1:05:38.660 --> 1:05:40.660
 So it was just me against the other guy

1:05:40.660 --> 1:05:41.660
 and that's how I always saw it.

1:05:41.660 --> 1:05:43.660
 And I just loved that moment.

1:05:43.660 --> 1:05:45.660
 So your dad was your coach.

1:05:48.660 --> 1:05:49.660
 You didn't get to meet him tonight.

1:05:49.660 --> 1:05:50.660
 Oh, great.

1:05:53.660 --> 1:05:55.660
 He's kind of a legend in the sport.

1:05:55.660 --> 1:05:58.660
 So how has your dad helped you as a coach,

1:05:58.660 --> 1:06:02.660
 as an athlete, as a human being throughout the years?

1:06:02.660 --> 1:06:06.660
 Number one, my dad is the most brutally honest person

1:06:06.660 --> 1:06:08.660
 you will ever meet in your life.

1:06:08.660 --> 1:06:09.660
 Brutally honest.

1:06:09.660 --> 1:06:12.660
 He will tell you, if you are fat,

1:06:12.660 --> 1:06:14.660
 he will tell you you're fat right to your face.

1:06:14.660 --> 1:06:15.660
 He wants you to get better.

1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:17.660
 He wants you to be healthy.

1:06:17.660 --> 1:06:19.660
 Doesn't want you to die of obesity.

1:06:19.660 --> 1:06:20.660
 It's just the way he is.

1:06:20.660 --> 1:06:23.660
 If you didn't do well, he will not sugarcoat it.

1:06:23.660 --> 1:06:26.660
 He will let you know what you didn't do right.

1:06:26.660 --> 1:06:28.660
 So he's the ultimate litmus test.

1:06:30.660 --> 1:06:33.660
 Second is he is the most passionate,

1:06:33.660 --> 1:06:36.660
 caring, like deep,

1:06:36.660 --> 1:06:40.660
 like always thinking about very cerebral,

1:06:40.660 --> 1:06:44.660
 very like a student of the game.

1:06:44.660 --> 1:06:48.660
 Somebody who helped me immensely in defining my strategy,

1:06:48.660 --> 1:06:53.660
 helping me improve and always look for what's next.

1:06:56.660 --> 1:06:57.660
 In terms of training,

1:06:57.660 --> 1:07:01.660
 I think that he's probably the most brilliant human

1:07:01.660 --> 1:07:05.660
 when it comes to preparing an athlete physically,

1:07:05.660 --> 1:07:09.660
 not to say mentally, physically for success.

1:07:09.660 --> 1:07:10.660
 When all the chips are down,

1:07:10.660 --> 1:07:12.660
 that athlete will be ready that day.

1:07:12.660 --> 1:07:15.660
 And he has a system of training and preparing

1:07:15.660 --> 1:07:18.660
 and getting the athlete to peak for performance.

1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:20.660
 You mean like conditioning, like the whole thing?

1:07:20.660 --> 1:07:21.660
 Yeah.

1:07:21.660 --> 1:07:22.660
 Okay.

1:07:22.660 --> 1:07:24.660
 Because I remember like vaguely,

1:07:24.660 --> 1:07:28.660
 I remember Kayla Harrison talking about her preparation

1:07:28.660 --> 1:07:31.660
 being very difficult.

1:07:31.660 --> 1:07:32.660
 Yeah.

1:07:32.660 --> 1:07:33.660
 That's it.

1:07:33.660 --> 1:07:34.660
 That's him?

1:07:34.660 --> 1:07:35.660
 Yeah.

1:07:35.660 --> 1:07:36.660
 That's him.

1:07:36.660 --> 1:07:39.660
 You go back and ask Ronda Rousey about her career, right?

1:07:39.660 --> 1:07:40.660
 My dad was her coach.

1:07:40.660 --> 1:07:41.660
 Yeah.

1:07:41.660 --> 1:07:45.660
 My dad moved her to Camp New Hampshire in Boston,

1:07:45.660 --> 1:07:47.660
 got her up, ran her in the morning,

1:07:47.660 --> 1:07:50.660
 had her downstairs in the basement of his house,

1:07:50.660 --> 1:07:51.660
 training with the weights.

1:07:51.660 --> 1:07:52.660
 We brought a Russian girl in.

1:07:52.660 --> 1:07:55.660
 She did throws on his cement outside with the little crash pad.

1:07:55.660 --> 1:07:56.660
 Nice.

1:07:56.660 --> 1:07:58.660
 We brought a Russian girl, you know,

1:07:58.660 --> 1:07:59.660
 a hundred times that morning.

1:07:59.660 --> 1:08:02.660
 And then every night came to Boston, you know,

1:08:02.660 --> 1:08:03.660
 to the training center in Wakefield,

1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:06.660
 trained at night and went back and slept at my dad's house

1:08:06.660 --> 1:08:09.660
 and three weeks straight before she went off to Beijing.

1:08:09.660 --> 1:08:11.660
 And he did the same with Kayla.

1:08:11.660 --> 1:08:12.660
 He did the same with me.

1:08:12.660 --> 1:08:14.660
 Like he's just,

1:08:14.660 --> 1:08:17.660
 his passion is producing athletes at the highest level.

1:08:17.660 --> 1:08:18.660
 And he knows how to do it.

1:08:18.660 --> 1:08:24.660
 And then the one side of my dad's coaching,

1:08:24.660 --> 1:08:27.660
 I think there's a flora weaknesses on the mental preparation

1:08:27.660 --> 1:08:28.660
 side of the game.

1:08:28.660 --> 1:08:30.660
 He wasn't somebody that was,

1:08:30.660 --> 1:08:32.660
 I don't know if he,

1:08:32.660 --> 1:08:34.660
 maybe because he was an Olympic champion himself

1:08:34.660 --> 1:08:36.660
 and wasn't a world champion,

1:08:36.660 --> 1:08:39.660
 he lacked the confidence in helping others be more confident.

1:08:39.660 --> 1:08:41.660
 So he's more of a,

1:08:41.660 --> 1:08:43.660
 this is what you need to work on type of thing.

1:08:43.660 --> 1:08:47.660
 He doesn't know how to build the athletes up to make them feel invincible.

1:08:47.660 --> 1:08:51.660
 And I feel like that's something that I was able to give all of the athletes

1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:54.660
 to help them with that visualization, belief in yourself,

1:08:54.660 --> 1:08:56.660
 knowing that you're going to win before you step out of the mat,

1:08:56.660 --> 1:08:59.660
 knowing that we've earned the right to victory,

1:08:59.660 --> 1:09:01.660
 seeing success in your mind,

1:09:01.660 --> 1:09:04.660
 having a positive mantra that you,

1:09:04.660 --> 1:09:05.660
 I'm the best in the world.

1:09:05.660 --> 1:09:07.660
 Nobody's beaten me today type of,

1:09:07.660 --> 1:09:08.660
 type of feeling.

1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:10.660
 So you go out there feeling like King Kong,

1:09:10.660 --> 1:09:11.660
 when you step on the mat,

1:09:11.660 --> 1:09:13.660
 nobody's going to stop you.

1:09:13.660 --> 1:09:17.660
 And so I think the combination of both of us as coaches,

1:09:17.660 --> 1:09:19.660
 I'm a lot more technical.

1:09:19.660 --> 1:09:21.660
 My dad is good at letting,

1:09:21.660 --> 1:09:24.660
 identifying what they need to do for their techniques

1:09:24.660 --> 1:09:27.660
 and strategy how to beat opponents

1:09:27.660 --> 1:09:29.660
 and putting game plans together.

1:09:29.660 --> 1:09:32.660
 So combined, the two of us made an unbelievable team.

1:09:32.660 --> 1:09:35.660
 So he's not going to let the athlete be soft

1:09:35.660 --> 1:09:38.660
 when they enter the highest,

1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:42.660
 the most difficult competitions of their career.

1:09:42.660 --> 1:09:44.660
 So on the mental side,

1:09:44.660 --> 1:09:47.660
 what's mental preparation look like?

1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:50.660
 Like how many years before the Olympics,

1:09:50.660 --> 1:09:53.660
 do you start helping an athlete believe

1:09:53.660 --> 1:09:56.660
 that they can win an Olympic medal?

1:09:56.660 --> 1:09:58.660
 Well, I think it's got to be a seed

1:09:58.660 --> 1:09:59.660
 in that athlete's brain,

1:09:59.660 --> 1:10:01.660
 something they want to do, right?

1:10:01.660 --> 1:10:05.660
 Nobody, nobody can quickly get there, right?

1:10:05.660 --> 1:10:06.660
 It's a long process.

1:10:06.660 --> 1:10:07.660
 But if your goal,

1:10:07.660 --> 1:10:08.660
 if you're a national champion

1:10:08.660 --> 1:10:10.660
 or you've proven yourself to win

1:10:10.660 --> 1:10:12.660
 at some international tournaments

1:10:12.660 --> 1:10:14.660
 and you think the Olympics is a possibility for you,

1:10:14.660 --> 1:10:16.660
 then defining it as,

1:10:16.660 --> 1:10:18.660
 hey, I want to be on the Olympic team,

1:10:18.660 --> 1:10:23.660
 that would be the first step into getting ready.

1:10:23.660 --> 1:10:27.660
 And I always make them put it on paper.

1:10:27.660 --> 1:10:29.660
 If it really is your goal,

1:10:29.660 --> 1:10:30.660
 then you show me that it's your goal

1:10:30.660 --> 1:10:32.660
 and put it on paper and commit to it.

1:10:32.660 --> 1:10:33.660
 I want to be Olympic medalist,

1:10:33.660 --> 1:10:34.660
 I want to be Olympic champion,

1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:35.660
 I want to go to the Olympics.

1:10:35.660 --> 1:10:38.660
 World team member, maybe junior world team member,

1:10:38.660 --> 1:10:39.660
 whatever it is,

1:10:39.660 --> 1:10:41.660
 we walk before we go to the highest level.

1:10:41.660 --> 1:10:43.660
 But if the goal is to go to the Olympics,

1:10:43.660 --> 1:10:46.660
 let's accomplish these other things first, right?

1:10:46.660 --> 1:10:49.660
 Because if we can accomplish these other things,

1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:51.660
 then we're on our way to getting to the ultimate goal,

1:10:51.660 --> 1:10:53.660
 which is the Olympics.

1:10:53.660 --> 1:10:55.660
 For somebody like Kayla, for example,

1:10:55.660 --> 1:11:01.660
 she didn't say that she wanted to be Olympic champion

1:11:01.660 --> 1:11:04.660
 when she first came here in 2005, right?

1:11:04.660 --> 1:11:07.660
 We wanted to become national champion.

1:11:07.660 --> 1:11:08.660
 Then we wanted to be on the world team.

1:11:08.660 --> 1:11:10.660
 Then we wanted to be a world medalist.

1:11:10.660 --> 1:11:12.660
 Then our sights were set on the Olympics

1:11:12.660 --> 1:11:14.660
 or the Olympic gold.

1:11:14.660 --> 1:11:16.660
 So it's having those clearly defined goals

1:11:16.660 --> 1:11:18.660
 that are attainable.

1:11:18.660 --> 1:11:20.660
 They should be a reach, they should be a stretch,

1:11:20.660 --> 1:11:22.660
 but they have to be attainable.

1:11:22.660 --> 1:11:24.660
 They can't be just a pipe dream.

1:11:24.660 --> 1:11:27.660
 But once you put it to paper

1:11:27.660 --> 1:11:29.660
 and you think it's achievable,

1:11:29.660 --> 1:11:32.660
 then it's mapping the plan to get there.

1:11:32.660 --> 1:11:34.660
 Is there a daily process

1:11:34.660 --> 1:11:37.660
 of visualizing yourself as an Olympic champion

1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:39.660
 or national champion?

1:11:39.660 --> 1:11:41.660
 Yes, it is.

1:11:41.660 --> 1:11:43.660
 You should do it either every night

1:11:43.660 --> 1:11:45.660
 before you go to bed

1:11:45.660 --> 1:11:48.660
 or before every training session

1:11:48.660 --> 1:11:50.660
 or after every training session.

1:11:50.660 --> 1:11:52.660
 One of those three times it should,

1:11:52.660 --> 1:11:54.660
 or first thing you wake up in the morning

1:11:54.660 --> 1:11:56.660
 because it may be to help some people,

1:11:56.660 --> 1:11:58.660
 it motivates them to go do what it is

1:11:58.660 --> 1:12:00.660
 they're supposed to do in the day.

1:12:00.660 --> 1:12:04.660
 But the process of visualization is, to me,

1:12:04.660 --> 1:12:07.660
 is closing your eyes for a few moments.

1:12:07.660 --> 1:12:09.660
 Your brain works really, really fast, right?

1:12:09.660 --> 1:12:12.660
 And it's actually picturing the day

1:12:12.660 --> 1:12:15.660
 in its entirety from start to finish.

1:12:15.660 --> 1:12:18.660
 From the moment you wake up and you step on the scale

1:12:18.660 --> 1:12:20.660
 to the moment you have your breakfast

1:12:20.660 --> 1:12:22.660
 and you go through your morning routine,

1:12:22.660 --> 1:12:24.660
 live the day that you're going to have at the Olympics.

1:12:24.660 --> 1:12:26.660
 So whatever it is you're trying to do,

1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:28.660
 let's say the Olympic day, for example,

1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:30.660
 picture yourself making weight,

1:12:30.660 --> 1:12:32.660
 picture yourself who you're around,

1:12:32.660 --> 1:12:34.660
 eating your breakfast, having maybe saying a few jokes,

1:12:34.660 --> 1:12:36.660
 laughing, this is a real day.

1:12:36.660 --> 1:12:38.660
 Make it real.

1:12:38.660 --> 1:12:42.660
 Going back and packing your judo bag for the day,

1:12:42.660 --> 1:12:45.660
 getting on the bus, driving to the venue,

1:12:45.660 --> 1:12:48.660
 feel what it's like walking into the stadium

1:12:48.660 --> 1:12:51.660
 for the first time, going to the warmup area,

1:12:51.660 --> 1:12:54.660
 seeing your draw up on the sheet

1:12:54.660 --> 1:12:56.660
 who you're going to fight that day,

1:12:56.660 --> 1:13:00.660
 watching yourself warm up, go through your warmup routine,

1:13:00.660 --> 1:13:03.660
 walking out of the chute into the venue,

1:13:03.660 --> 1:13:05.660
 going to do that first fight,

1:13:05.660 --> 1:13:08.660
 picture the moment of throwing your opponent coming off the mat,

1:13:08.660 --> 1:13:12.660
 high fiving the coach, getting ready for your second fight,

1:13:12.660 --> 1:13:15.660
 like live the day from start to finish

1:13:15.660 --> 1:13:17.660
 and make it as real as possible.

1:13:17.660 --> 1:13:20.660
 You know, we're all the way to the moment where you've just won

1:13:20.660 --> 1:13:23.660
 and you're raising your arms in celebration,

1:13:23.660 --> 1:13:25.660
 you're bowing, you're hugging your opponent,

1:13:25.660 --> 1:13:28.660
 you come off the mat, you hug your coach,

1:13:28.660 --> 1:13:31.660
 you're running around the stadium with the flag,

1:13:31.660 --> 1:13:34.660
 you stepped up on the podium, you heard your name,

1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:38.660
 Olympic champion Jimmy Pedro, like you heard the moment,

1:13:38.660 --> 1:13:41.660
 the medal being put around your neck,

1:13:41.660 --> 1:13:44.660
 picture the people coming up on the podium with you,

1:13:44.660 --> 1:13:47.660
 arms around them taking the pictures,

1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:50.660
 like the more real you can make it,

1:13:50.660 --> 1:13:54.660
 even before it ever happens, right?

1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:57.660
 When you do that enough times,

1:13:57.660 --> 1:14:01.660
 I feel that like pathways get created for you

1:14:01.660 --> 1:14:04.660
 so that when your body gets to that moment,

1:14:04.660 --> 1:14:07.660
 and I've been here before, this is it, this is my moment,

1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:09.660
 this is what I picture my whole life, I'm not nervous,

1:14:09.660 --> 1:14:11.660
 because I've seen this, this is going to happen,

1:14:11.660 --> 1:14:13.660
 I believe it's possible, right?

1:14:13.660 --> 1:14:17.660
 And I believe the athletes that do that and make it real enough

1:14:17.660 --> 1:14:20.660
 that when they get to that moment, they go right through,

1:14:20.660 --> 1:14:22.660
 there's no hesitation.

1:14:22.660 --> 1:14:25.660
 This is what, this is meant to be, this is my destiny,

1:14:25.660 --> 1:14:27.660
 this is why I did everything I did,

1:14:27.660 --> 1:14:29.660
 versus the ones that don't think about it ever,

1:14:29.660 --> 1:14:33.660
 but just kind of like hope, it's not real to them,

1:14:33.660 --> 1:14:36.660
 it doesn't feel attainable, they don't believe it's possible,

1:14:36.660 --> 1:14:39.660
 they haven't committed to believing it was possible.

1:14:39.660 --> 1:14:42.660
 Without that commitment in yourself and that belief,

1:14:42.660 --> 1:14:43.660
 it can't happen.

1:14:43.660 --> 1:14:47.660
 And one thing that, I talked to Travis a bit about this,

1:14:47.660 --> 1:14:50.660
 you probably worked with him on the details

1:14:50.660 --> 1:14:52.660
 of what you're talking about,

1:14:52.660 --> 1:14:55.660
 but he said that you should really,

1:14:55.660 --> 1:15:00.660
 focus on visualizing the sensations you feel.

1:15:00.660 --> 1:15:03.660
 So say if you're drinking coffee or something like that,

1:15:03.660 --> 1:15:07.660
 you're not thinking about observing yourself

1:15:07.660 --> 1:15:10.660
 from a third person perspective drinking coffee,

1:15:10.660 --> 1:15:14.660
 you're thinking of how your hand will feel

1:15:14.660 --> 1:15:16.660
 when it touches something warm.

1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:20.660
 You try to replay the actual sensations you would feel.

1:15:20.660 --> 1:15:24.660
 It sounds kind of strange,

1:15:24.660 --> 1:15:27.660
 but meaning you really want to put yourself in the body

1:15:27.660 --> 1:15:30.660
 as you would experience those moments,

1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:33.660
 as opposed to watching yourself on TV experience

1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:36.660
 in those moments, really be inside.

1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:40.660
 So that means sensations, how does it feel when you grip a gi?

1:15:40.660 --> 1:15:46.660
 How does the sweating, just the sensation of sweat,

1:15:46.660 --> 1:15:49.660
 rolling down your forehead or whatever,

1:15:49.660 --> 1:15:52.660
 all of those actual feelings.

1:15:52.660 --> 1:15:54.660
 When I explain it to you,

1:15:54.660 --> 1:15:57.660
 I guess my body has been through it so many times,

1:15:57.660 --> 1:15:59.660
 both in my mind and in reality,

1:15:59.660 --> 1:16:02.660
 that it brings back all of those same emotions.

1:16:02.660 --> 1:16:04.660
 I start to get goosebumps.

1:16:04.660 --> 1:16:06.660
 My armpits start to sweat.

1:16:06.660 --> 1:16:08.660
 I'm living it if it's real.

1:16:08.660 --> 1:16:10.660
 I'm reliving it now,

1:16:10.660 --> 1:16:13.660
 but when you're going through the visualization process,

1:16:13.660 --> 1:16:15.660
 it has to be that real.

1:16:15.660 --> 1:16:18.660
 The smells, the taping of the fingers,

1:16:18.660 --> 1:16:22.660
 the more colorful and the more real you can make it,

1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:24.660
 the more believable it is.

1:16:24.660 --> 1:16:27.660
 So I've been doing this kind of thing,

1:16:27.660 --> 1:16:32.660
 just having listened to you enough for other stuff in life.

1:16:32.660 --> 1:16:34.660
 So let's see if it works.

1:16:34.660 --> 1:16:37.660
 But do you see this kind of visualization being useful

1:16:37.660 --> 1:16:40.660
 for other things in career and all those kinds of things?

1:16:40.660 --> 1:16:46.660
 All 100% because I just know with my own life,

1:16:46.660 --> 1:16:48.660
 my own experiences,

1:16:48.660 --> 1:16:51.660
 my wife sometimes says to me,

1:16:51.660 --> 1:16:55.660
 where do you see yourself in five years from now?

1:16:55.660 --> 1:16:58.660
 Five years ago, I had said to her,

1:16:58.660 --> 1:17:01.660
 I want to have my own business.

1:17:01.660 --> 1:17:04.660
 This is the amount of money that I'm hoping

1:17:04.660 --> 1:17:06.660
 I can make in a given year.

1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:08.660
 You have to have goals for yourself.

1:17:08.660 --> 1:17:10.660
 If you put out there, okay,

1:17:10.660 --> 1:17:12.660
 I want to make a million dollars in a year.

1:17:12.660 --> 1:17:14.660
 That's a big number.

1:17:14.660 --> 1:17:16.660
 That's a really big number.

1:17:16.660 --> 1:17:18.660
 You know what I mean?

1:17:18.660 --> 1:17:20.660
 Especially when you're not making that much at the time,

1:17:20.660 --> 1:17:22.660
 it's a super big number.

1:17:22.660 --> 1:17:24.660
 So having those goals for yourself,

1:17:24.660 --> 1:17:27.660
 it won't happen and it's not possible

1:17:27.660 --> 1:17:29.660
 unless you dream it's possible

1:17:29.660 --> 1:17:31.660
 and think that it's possible.

1:17:31.660 --> 1:17:33.660
 And then it doesn't magically happen

1:17:33.660 --> 1:17:35.660
 and maybe it doesn't happen in five years,

1:17:35.660 --> 1:17:37.660
 maybe it happens in 10.

1:17:37.660 --> 1:17:39.660
 But at least you're on the path to getting there.

1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:41.660
 You know what I mean?

1:17:41.660 --> 1:17:43.660
 And I said, I want to own my own business.

1:17:43.660 --> 1:17:45.660
 I want to own my own destiny.

1:17:45.660 --> 1:17:47.660
 I want to be my own boss.

1:17:47.660 --> 1:17:49.660
 I want to make my own decisions.

1:17:49.660 --> 1:17:51.660
 These are the things that I told I wanted to do.

1:17:51.660 --> 1:17:54.660
 And now I'm at that point where I work for myself.

1:17:54.660 --> 1:17:56.660
 I have my own company.

1:17:56.660 --> 1:17:58.660
 I have partners, obviously.

1:17:58.660 --> 1:18:01.660
 But if I want to pick up and go somewhere for a week,

1:18:01.660 --> 1:18:02.660
 I just do.

1:18:02.660 --> 1:18:04.660
 I don't have to ask permission to do it.

1:18:04.660 --> 1:18:06.660
 That's what life, freedom, right?

1:18:06.660 --> 1:18:08.660
 That's what I like.

1:18:08.660 --> 1:18:10.660
 And all of it starts with a dream.

1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:14.660
 When I first opened, so I ran a dojo for a long time

1:18:14.660 --> 1:18:16.660
 and I only had 60 students always,

1:18:16.660 --> 1:18:19.660
 like 40 to 60 students had fluctuated.

1:18:19.660 --> 1:18:20.660
 And I said to myself,

1:18:20.660 --> 1:18:22.660
 why can't I get more people on my door, right?

1:18:22.660 --> 1:18:24.660
 So I hired consultants to come in

1:18:24.660 --> 1:18:27.660
 and look at my business and say why, right?

1:18:27.660 --> 1:18:29.660
 And they came in and said,

1:18:29.660 --> 1:18:31.660
 well, this place is really intimidating.

1:18:31.660 --> 1:18:33.660
 If I was coming in off the street,

1:18:33.660 --> 1:18:35.660
 the first thing I see is this big Olympic champion on the wall

1:18:35.660 --> 1:18:37.660
 and I see this training that's going on

1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:39.660
 and these guys are flying through the air

1:18:39.660 --> 1:18:41.660
 hard and as a white belt, you're telling me,

1:18:41.660 --> 1:18:42.660
 that's the class for me?

1:18:42.660 --> 1:18:44.660
 Like no way, I'm not going to do that.

1:18:44.660 --> 1:18:47.660
 So like I listened to these people and I said, you're right.

1:18:47.660 --> 1:18:50.660
 And you know, the training was hour and a half, two hours long.

1:18:50.660 --> 1:18:52.660
 People can't handle an hour and a half or two hours training

1:18:52.660 --> 1:18:54.660
 when they're first walking in the door.

1:18:54.660 --> 1:18:56.660
 So I had to restructure all my programming.

1:18:56.660 --> 1:18:59.660
 I had to look at the way I was offering my curriculum at my school

1:18:59.660 --> 1:19:02.660
 and I had to make levels for everybody, right?

1:19:02.660 --> 1:19:05.660
 Like here's my four to six year old class.

1:19:05.660 --> 1:19:07.660
 Here's my six to 13 year old class.

1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:09.660
 There's all my beginner classes.

1:19:09.660 --> 1:19:12.660
 They don't mix in with the advanced people and like, you know,

1:19:12.660 --> 1:19:16.660
 and I had to learn how to make it accessible for everybody

1:19:16.660 --> 1:19:19.660
 instead of just the people that wanted to train hard.

1:19:19.660 --> 1:19:21.660
 And then the challenge was, okay,

1:19:21.660 --> 1:19:24.660
 if you can have a lot of people in your dojo training,

1:19:24.660 --> 1:19:25.660
 it's a recreational school.

1:19:25.660 --> 1:19:27.660
 You can't produce champions at that same school.

1:19:27.660 --> 1:19:29.660
 That's what I was told.

1:19:29.660 --> 1:19:32.660
 So then I got all my black belts together and I said, listen,

1:19:32.660 --> 1:19:33.660
 this is my vision.

1:19:33.660 --> 1:19:34.660
 This is what I want.

1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:37.660
 I want to have a club that has over 200 judo only athletes,

1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:40.660
 no jiu jitsu, no karate, nothing, judo only.

1:19:40.660 --> 1:19:42.660
 I want over 200 people.

1:19:42.660 --> 1:19:44.660
 And in the inside of that dojo,

1:19:44.660 --> 1:19:48.660
 I want to have Olympic champions and I want to have recreational

1:19:48.660 --> 1:19:50.660
 like little kids, five and six years old,

1:19:50.660 --> 1:19:52.660
 older guys in their seventies train.

1:19:52.660 --> 1:19:54.660
 I don't care, but I want the spectrum of recreational

1:19:54.660 --> 1:19:56.660
 and I want Olympic champions.

1:19:56.660 --> 1:20:00.660
 The only way to do that is to take your instructors and say,

1:20:00.660 --> 1:20:02.660
 you're going to do this, you define the roles,

1:20:02.660 --> 1:20:04.660
 who's going to be the recreational coach?

1:20:04.660 --> 1:20:05.660
 Who's going to be the competitive coach?

1:20:05.660 --> 1:20:07.660
 How do we separate these programs?

1:20:07.660 --> 1:20:08.660
 And lo and behold,

1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:10.660
 that was my vision that I shared with all of them.

1:20:10.660 --> 1:20:14.660
 And that was back in 2006.

1:20:14.660 --> 1:20:19.660
 And by 2012, we've got Olympic champion Kayla Harrison.

1:20:19.660 --> 1:20:21.660
 We have over 200 people at the school.

1:20:21.660 --> 1:20:23.660
 We have a successful thriving business,

1:20:23.660 --> 1:20:25.660
 but it doesn't happen without that vision,

1:20:25.660 --> 1:20:29.660
 a plan and believing that it's possible.

1:20:29.660 --> 1:20:31.660
 Believing that it's possible.

1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:36.660
 I don't know, but I personally have on top of that,

1:20:36.660 --> 1:20:41.660
 almost like very specific visions of a future.

1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:44.660
 Like, I don't know what,

1:20:44.660 --> 1:20:46.660
 because I don't want to give the actual examples,

1:20:46.660 --> 1:20:49.660
 because for several reasons,

1:20:49.660 --> 1:20:52.660
 one of which is just people will,

1:20:52.660 --> 1:20:55.660
 as they often have, they often will in your life.

1:20:55.660 --> 1:20:58.660
 They'll just laugh at it a little bit.

1:20:58.660 --> 1:21:01.660
 Like, that seems silly.

1:21:01.660 --> 1:21:05.660
 And I don't, I'm very hesitant to share certain things like that

1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:07.660
 with people because they'll,

1:21:07.660 --> 1:21:10.660
 I mean, and with Johnny Ive,

1:21:10.660 --> 1:21:13.660
 who's the lead designer in Apple,

1:21:13.660 --> 1:21:16.660
 you want that dream, that little flame to not,

1:21:16.660 --> 1:21:19.660
 people will put that flame out too easily,

1:21:19.660 --> 1:21:21.660
 even people that love you.

1:21:21.660 --> 1:21:26.660
 So I have very specific kind of visions,

1:21:26.660 --> 1:21:28.660
 like maybe for Travis,

1:21:28.660 --> 1:21:30.660
 it would be like a specific opponent

1:21:30.660 --> 1:21:32.660
 or something like Ole Bischoff.

1:21:32.660 --> 1:21:35.660
 Very specific, very specific situation

1:21:35.660 --> 1:21:36.660
 of what's going to happen,

1:21:36.660 --> 1:21:38.660
 not just like I want to be Olympic champion,

1:21:38.660 --> 1:21:42.660
 but very specific, almost silly situations.

1:21:42.660 --> 1:21:45.660
 Yeah, like the dynamic between Travis and Ole Bischoff

1:21:45.660 --> 1:21:47.660
 or something, maybe visualize that.

1:21:47.660 --> 1:21:50.660
 For me, that helps because it makes it all real,

1:21:50.660 --> 1:21:52.660
 even more real.

1:21:52.660 --> 1:21:54.660
 It's not like some big goal,

1:21:54.660 --> 1:21:56.660
 a million dollars or something like that,

1:21:56.660 --> 1:21:58.660
 which is also really important to have

1:21:58.660 --> 1:22:00.660
 because you can measure it and so on,

1:22:00.660 --> 1:22:05.660
 but it's just like you belong in those situations.

1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:08.660
 Just believing you belong in there.

1:22:08.660 --> 1:22:09.660
 It's not the...

1:22:09.660 --> 1:22:10.660
 It could be you.

1:22:10.660 --> 1:22:11.660
 Yeah, it could be you.

1:22:11.660 --> 1:22:13.660
 And for some reason, that really helps me,

1:22:13.660 --> 1:22:15.660
 the little details.

1:22:15.660 --> 1:22:17.660
 The visualizing,

1:22:17.660 --> 1:22:20.660
 most of them are almost a little bit funny,

1:22:20.660 --> 1:22:23.660
 like the focusing on the funniness.

1:22:23.660 --> 1:22:27.660
 The mundaneness of it helps me a lot.

1:22:27.660 --> 1:22:29.660
 And all the people that have done great things,

1:22:29.660 --> 1:22:31.660
 they're just human too.

1:22:31.660 --> 1:22:34.660
 Correct, and I think a lot of people

1:22:34.660 --> 1:22:38.660
 overestimate who others are, right?

1:22:38.660 --> 1:22:41.660
 And sell themselves too short.

1:22:41.660 --> 1:22:42.660
 Yeah.

1:22:42.660 --> 1:22:45.660
 Because at the end of the day, everybody started...

1:22:45.660 --> 1:22:47.660
 Like everybody else, really.

1:22:47.660 --> 1:22:48.660
 I mean, we did.

1:22:48.660 --> 1:22:49.660
 We're all inference.

1:22:49.660 --> 1:22:50.660
 We couldn't walk.

1:22:50.660 --> 1:22:51.660
 We couldn't talk.

1:22:51.660 --> 1:22:52.660
 We couldn't do anything.

1:22:52.660 --> 1:22:53.660
 We couldn't learn along the way.

1:22:53.660 --> 1:22:54.660
 But...

1:22:54.660 --> 1:22:57.660
 And I think that's the one thing that I realized is that...

1:22:57.660 --> 1:23:00.660
 And I tell this to my athletes,

1:23:00.660 --> 1:23:03.660
 but I also tell it to my recreational students.

1:23:03.660 --> 1:23:06.660
 Nobody is better than you are.

1:23:06.660 --> 1:23:07.660
 Nobody.

1:23:07.660 --> 1:23:09.660
 Unless you allow them to be.

1:23:09.660 --> 1:23:11.660
 If you really want something to happen,

1:23:11.660 --> 1:23:14.660
 then like map the plan.

1:23:14.660 --> 1:23:16.660
 Believe in yourself.

1:23:16.660 --> 1:23:17.660
 Decide.

1:23:17.660 --> 1:23:19.660
 And no, full out.

1:23:19.660 --> 1:23:20.660
 You're going to fail a lot.

1:23:20.660 --> 1:23:21.660
 You're going to get beat down.

1:23:21.660 --> 1:23:22.660
 You're going to have losses.

1:23:22.660 --> 1:23:24.660
 You're going to have struggles.

1:23:24.660 --> 1:23:26.660
 Like, and I think that's the one thing with social media today

1:23:26.660 --> 1:23:29.660
 is that everybody sees everybody succeed.

1:23:29.660 --> 1:23:32.660
 Nobody posts a picture when they're on the ground and fail.

1:23:32.660 --> 1:23:33.660
 You're losing.

1:23:33.660 --> 1:23:35.660
 Like nobody sees when you broke your arm

1:23:35.660 --> 1:23:37.660
 and you had to go through rehab, you know, whatever it is.

1:23:37.660 --> 1:23:40.660
 Like had your injuries and you were on your couch watching TV

1:23:40.660 --> 1:23:42.660
 and you were suffering and you were...

1:23:42.660 --> 1:23:46.660
 Like everybody has really, really dark, bad moments in their life

1:23:46.660 --> 1:23:49.660
 and defeats and losses and suffrage.

1:23:49.660 --> 1:23:53.660
 And it's only at the end after they've recovered from all of that.

1:23:53.660 --> 1:23:56.660
 They've reclined up the mountain and they've gone to the pinnacle

1:23:56.660 --> 1:23:58.660
 that you see them on social media with the metal.

1:23:58.660 --> 1:23:59.660
 Right?

1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:02.660
 But everybody else like struggles and was human

1:24:02.660 --> 1:24:07.660
 and failed many, many times and, you know,

1:24:07.660 --> 1:24:09.660
 convincing yourself that you're capable,

1:24:09.660 --> 1:24:12.660
 I think is the first start of everything.

1:24:12.660 --> 1:24:15.660
 Do you need people in your life that believe in you

1:24:15.660 --> 1:24:18.660
 or should most of it come from within yourself?

1:24:18.660 --> 1:24:20.660
 I think most of it has to come in from...

1:24:20.660 --> 1:24:24.660
 It certainly helps, but it has to come from you first.

1:24:24.660 --> 1:24:26.660
 You have to be driven.

1:24:26.660 --> 1:24:30.660
 Like other people can help you define where you want to go

1:24:30.660 --> 1:24:33.660
 and help you get there and encourage you and can support you

1:24:33.660 --> 1:24:37.660
 and, you know, whether it's resource wise or with connections

1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:39.660
 and like they can help with that path.

1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:42.660
 But that first part has to come from you.

1:24:42.660 --> 1:24:47.660
 It has to be your passion, your desire, your commitment to yourself.

1:24:47.660 --> 1:24:49.660
 You're the one that's going to ultimately make

1:24:49.660 --> 1:24:51.660
 all the sacrifices to do it.

1:24:51.660 --> 1:24:53.660
 So it has to be your decision, not your parents,

1:24:53.660 --> 1:24:58.660
 not your spouses, something that you're really motivated to do.

1:24:58.660 --> 1:25:00.660
 Let me ask you about Travis, Kayla,

1:25:00.660 --> 1:25:03.660
 and maybe a few of the other athletes you've been involved with.

1:25:03.660 --> 1:25:05.660
 So first, Travis.

1:25:05.660 --> 1:25:10.660
 Travis Stevens, Olympic silver medalist,

1:25:10.660 --> 1:25:16.660
 three time Olympian 2008, 2012, 2016.

1:25:16.660 --> 1:25:19.660
 What makes Travis Stevens great?

1:25:19.660 --> 1:25:22.660
 What makes him so successful?

1:25:22.660 --> 1:25:25.660
 What makes him unique in your mind as an athlete?

1:25:25.660 --> 1:25:28.660
 Through all the hardship he had to overcome,

1:25:28.660 --> 1:25:32.660
 through his weird looking Sayonagi,

1:25:32.660 --> 1:25:35.660
 that eventually worked out nicely,

1:25:35.660 --> 1:25:38.660
 through the full richness of his personality.

1:25:38.660 --> 1:25:41.660
 In the context of all the other great athletes you've coached,

1:25:41.660 --> 1:25:44.660
 what makes him special?

1:25:44.660 --> 1:25:46.660
 His fight.

1:25:46.660 --> 1:25:48.660
 Travis has fight.

1:25:48.660 --> 1:25:51.660
 The first time I ever saw Travis Stevens was in,

1:25:51.660 --> 1:25:53.660
 recognized him.

1:25:53.660 --> 1:25:55.660
 Maybe I had seen him before as a younger boy or something,

1:25:55.660 --> 1:25:57.660
 but actually recognized him is,

1:25:57.660 --> 1:26:00.660
 I brought a group of young kids to Italy

1:26:00.660 --> 1:26:03.660
 for a competition in a training camp.

1:26:03.660 --> 1:26:06.660
 It was this program called U23 Elite,

1:26:06.660 --> 1:26:10.660
 and I handpicked 20 kids to go to this event.

1:26:10.660 --> 1:26:14.660
 And it was the first time I coached an international team.

1:26:14.660 --> 1:26:16.660
 And I had never seen Travis fight before,

1:26:16.660 --> 1:26:18.660
 compete, train anything.

1:26:18.660 --> 1:26:20.660
 And during this competition,

1:26:20.660 --> 1:26:22.660
 he's an 81 kilo player.

1:26:22.660 --> 1:26:25.660
 I think he was maybe like 18 years old,

1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:27.660
 17, 18 years old.

1:26:27.660 --> 1:26:30.660
 And it was a really hard European event.

1:26:30.660 --> 1:26:34.660
 And I think Travis won three matches and he lost two.

1:26:34.660 --> 1:26:38.660
 But what stood out the most to me was like the fight he had in him.

1:26:38.660 --> 1:26:40.660
 He was scrapping every fight.

1:26:40.660 --> 1:26:42.660
 Like he scrapped hard.

1:26:42.660 --> 1:26:44.660
 Like he wanted to win more than any of them, right?

1:26:44.660 --> 1:26:47.660
 He didn't win, but he wanted to win more.

1:26:47.660 --> 1:26:49.660
 And I noticed that right away.

1:26:49.660 --> 1:26:52.660
 And then I also noticed that after he lost his second match,

1:26:52.660 --> 1:26:54.660
 he was eliminated from the tournament.

1:26:54.660 --> 1:26:56.660
 I saw how disappointed he was in himself.

1:26:56.660 --> 1:26:59.660
 Like he actually thought he was supposed to beat those people,

1:26:59.660 --> 1:27:01.660
 even though he was like 17, right?

1:27:01.660 --> 1:27:03.660
 And he's fighting against grown men that are, you know,

1:27:03.660 --> 1:27:05.660
 a high level judo, much higher than he was.

1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:07.660
 And I said to him, I said, hey son,

1:27:07.660 --> 1:27:09.660
 like don't worry, man.

1:27:09.660 --> 1:27:11.660
 You got a long career ahead of you.

1:27:11.660 --> 1:27:13.660
 Like I'm glad you're disappointed,

1:27:13.660 --> 1:27:15.660
 but there's so many things you don't know

1:27:15.660 --> 1:27:17.660
 and so many skills you don't have.

1:27:17.660 --> 1:27:20.660
 The fact that you were able to hold your own and scrap like that,

1:27:20.660 --> 1:27:21.660
 like you've got a good future.

1:27:21.660 --> 1:27:24.660
 And I remember calling my friend, Jason Morris,

1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:26.660
 after that tournament.

1:27:26.660 --> 1:27:27.660
 And I said, hey man,

1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:29.660
 did you ever hear of this kid Travis Stevens?

1:27:29.660 --> 1:27:30.660
 He says, no, why?

1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:32.660
 I said, man, the kids got some fighting him, right?

1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:35.660
 And I said that, I said that to Jason at the time.

1:27:35.660 --> 1:27:36.660
 I said, the kids got some fighting him, man.

1:27:36.660 --> 1:27:38.660
 He's pretty talented, you know?

1:27:38.660 --> 1:27:40.660
 And that's how it started.

1:27:40.660 --> 1:27:42.660
 So I saw that I meant when he was young,

1:27:42.660 --> 1:27:45.660
 but the other thing was Travis,

1:27:45.660 --> 1:27:49.660
 like there's no such thing as hard work to that guy.

1:27:49.660 --> 1:27:51.660
 If you tell him to put his head through the wall

1:27:51.660 --> 1:27:54.660
 and that's how he wins, he'll go put his head through the wall.

1:27:54.660 --> 1:28:00.660
 He'll do whatever it takes for him to do to achieve success.

1:28:00.660 --> 1:28:05.660
 And he hates failure more than he likes winning.

1:28:05.660 --> 1:28:07.660
 100% he always has.

1:28:07.660 --> 1:28:09.660
 He punishes himself when he doesn't do well.

1:28:09.660 --> 1:28:11.660
 He makes himself work harder.

1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:17.660
 He goes and just abuses himself when he doesn't succeed

1:28:17.660 --> 1:28:21.660
 because he's so heartbroken and disappointed in himself.

1:28:21.660 --> 1:28:23.660
 So that's a trait that I think all of the athletes

1:28:23.660 --> 1:28:26.660
 that I work with, like closely,

1:28:26.660 --> 1:28:27.660
 they all had that same trait.

1:28:27.660 --> 1:28:29.660
 They hated losing more than anything.

1:28:29.660 --> 1:28:32.660
 They would break their arm, they'd fall on their head.

1:28:32.660 --> 1:28:36.660
 They'd rather get hit by a car than lose a judo tournament.

1:28:36.660 --> 1:28:38.660
 And as a result, then they all had fight

1:28:38.660 --> 1:28:40.660
 and they all were willing to train,

1:28:40.660 --> 1:28:41.660
 they were willing to listen,

1:28:41.660 --> 1:28:43.660
 and they would do anything for victory.

1:28:43.660 --> 1:28:47.660
 Within the rules, I'm not talking about taking drugs or anything like that,

1:28:47.660 --> 1:28:52.660
 but they'd give 100% of themselves for victory.

1:28:52.660 --> 1:28:55.660
 And Travis was somebody that when he was down,

1:28:55.660 --> 1:28:58.660
 he found a way to get better doing something else.

1:28:58.660 --> 1:29:01.660
 If he couldn't do standing, that's when he started jujitsu.

1:29:01.660 --> 1:29:02.660
 He couldn't go on his feet anymore.

1:29:02.660 --> 1:29:04.660
 He couldn't stand up and train.

1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:07.660
 I might as well go learn jujitsu and get good on the ground, right?

1:29:07.660 --> 1:29:08.660
 Because I can't.

1:29:08.660 --> 1:29:10.660
 So he always found a way,

1:29:10.660 --> 1:29:12.660
 and no matter what obstacle was in his way,

1:29:12.660 --> 1:29:13.660
 he just went around it.

1:29:13.660 --> 1:29:15.660
 So what about the...

1:29:15.660 --> 1:29:17.660
 It'd be interesting to get your perspective,

1:29:17.660 --> 1:29:19.660
 because I know Travis's perspective

1:29:19.660 --> 1:29:23.660
 is just the number of injuries.

1:29:23.660 --> 1:29:25.660
 What do you make of the perseverance

1:29:25.660 --> 1:29:28.660
 through all the injuries he had to overcome?

1:29:28.660 --> 1:29:33.660
 Specifically, you just observing this creature that you've coached.

1:29:33.660 --> 1:29:37.660
 He seems to not see the injuries as a problem.

1:29:37.660 --> 1:29:40.660
 Just like you said, head through the wall.

1:29:40.660 --> 1:29:44.660
 It's like, when we're talking about injuries,

1:29:44.660 --> 1:29:49.660
 he doesn't even see the injuries themselves as the problem,

1:29:49.660 --> 1:29:54.660
 because he thinks that the injuries, you heal back stronger.

1:29:54.660 --> 1:29:56.660
 I forget the exact quote,

1:29:56.660 --> 1:30:02.660
 like my body is now less injury prone than most of anyone else.

1:30:02.660 --> 1:30:03.660
 Because I've already broken everything.

1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:04.660
 I've broken everything.

1:30:04.660 --> 1:30:06.660
 And it's just grown back stronger.

1:30:06.660 --> 1:30:08.660
 Because I asked him something like,

1:30:08.660 --> 1:30:10.660
 do you regret sort of pushing your body

1:30:10.660 --> 1:30:14.660
 to all of those places that resulted in those injuries?

1:30:14.660 --> 1:30:16.660
 His response was like,

1:30:16.660 --> 1:30:18.660
 no, I'm stronger now.

1:30:18.660 --> 1:30:21.660
 So I don't know if that's justification,

1:30:21.660 --> 1:30:23.660
 but that certainly describes a mindset

1:30:23.660 --> 1:30:25.660
 that, yeah, head through the wall,

1:30:25.660 --> 1:30:27.660
 that doesn't...

1:30:27.660 --> 1:30:30.660
 It's almost not dramatic.

1:30:30.660 --> 1:30:32.660
 Like, look, I got this injury.

1:30:32.660 --> 1:30:36.660
 I'm so brave and special for overcoming this injury.

1:30:36.660 --> 1:30:39.660
 That's part of the job.

1:30:39.660 --> 1:30:41.660
 And he gets the job done.

1:30:41.660 --> 1:30:44.660
 But that job involves a lot of injuries.

1:30:44.660 --> 1:30:46.660
 One of the talks I gave Travis and that team

1:30:46.660 --> 1:30:48.660
 at that particular tournament

1:30:48.660 --> 1:30:50.660
 was at the very beginning of the camp,

1:30:50.660 --> 1:30:52.660
 after the tournament, I said to them, listen,

1:30:52.660 --> 1:30:54.660
 my vision, I shared my vision with them.

1:30:54.660 --> 1:30:57.660
 I said, my vision is, you know, in seven years,

1:30:57.660 --> 1:30:58.660
 because that was 2005.

1:30:58.660 --> 1:31:00.660
 I said, in seven years,

1:31:00.660 --> 1:31:03.660
 I want to have a U.S. team that steps on the mat

1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:05.660
 that is ready to kick ass.

1:31:05.660 --> 1:31:07.660
 And in order to get there,

1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:09.660
 all of you guys can be a part of this team

1:31:09.660 --> 1:31:10.660
 and part of this process,

1:31:10.660 --> 1:31:11.660
 but in order to get there,

1:31:11.660 --> 1:31:13.660
 you guys have to be the first ones to practice.

1:31:13.660 --> 1:31:15.660
 You have to be the last ones to leave

1:31:15.660 --> 1:31:18.660
 because we have to work harder than the rest of the world

1:31:18.660 --> 1:31:20.660
 because we're up against all odds.

1:31:20.660 --> 1:31:23.660
 I said, I am sick of America being a laughing stock

1:31:23.660 --> 1:31:26.660
 of Judo and being the first round, easy match,

1:31:26.660 --> 1:31:28.660
 warm up for everybody else.

1:31:28.660 --> 1:31:30.660
 I said, if you get injured,

1:31:30.660 --> 1:31:33.660
 you're not going to be on the side with, you know,

1:31:33.660 --> 1:31:35.660
 with a ice bag on, taking off rounds.

1:31:35.660 --> 1:31:37.660
 And then get back on the mat the next day

1:31:37.660 --> 1:31:38.660
 and tell me you're okay.

1:31:38.660 --> 1:31:40.660
 If you can train the next day, you can train today.

1:31:40.660 --> 1:31:41.660
 So there's no injury.

1:31:41.660 --> 1:31:43.660
 The only time you'll leave in this dojo

1:31:43.660 --> 1:31:46.660
 is if the ambulance has to take you out of here.

1:31:46.660 --> 1:31:48.660
 You know, and I do think, subliminally,

1:31:48.660 --> 1:31:50.660
 Travis bought into that message

1:31:50.660 --> 1:31:52.660
 and heard that message then.

1:31:52.660 --> 1:31:53.660
 He said, if I'm going to be a champ,

1:31:53.660 --> 1:31:55.660
 then that's the way I'm going to do it.

1:31:55.660 --> 1:31:56.660
 And he did.

1:31:56.660 --> 1:31:57.660
 And he embodied it.

1:31:57.660 --> 1:31:58.660
 He lived it.

1:31:58.660 --> 1:32:02.660
 Man, do it many times in Europe where I said, dude,

1:32:02.660 --> 1:32:04.660
 just tape it up or go off to the side.

1:32:04.660 --> 1:32:05.660
 Just take the day off.

1:32:05.660 --> 1:32:07.660
 Like take the rest of the day off, you're beat up.

1:32:07.660 --> 1:32:08.660
 You can't do it.

1:32:08.660 --> 1:32:09.660
 He said, no, no, I'm going to tape it up.

1:32:09.660 --> 1:32:10.660
 I'm going to tape it up.

1:32:10.660 --> 1:32:11.660
 I said, no, you don't need to right now.

1:32:11.660 --> 1:32:13.660
 And he said, no, sensei, I'm doing it.

1:32:13.660 --> 1:32:16.660
 You know, the ambulance isn't taking me out.

1:32:16.660 --> 1:32:17.660
 It's just my wrist.

1:32:17.660 --> 1:32:18.660
 It's just my ankle.

1:32:18.660 --> 1:32:19.660
 It's just my wrist.

1:32:19.660 --> 1:32:21.660
 It's just my ankle.

1:32:21.660 --> 1:32:22.660
 Yeah, I love it.

1:32:22.660 --> 1:32:23.660
 Yeah.

1:32:23.660 --> 1:32:24.660
 What about the...

1:32:24.660 --> 1:32:28.660
 So the other really big thing is you comment on a little bit

1:32:28.660 --> 1:32:29.660
 is the weight cut.

1:32:29.660 --> 1:32:32.660
 So early in his career, he was 81kg.

1:32:32.660 --> 1:32:36.660
 And that was presumably not so difficult.

1:32:36.660 --> 1:32:39.660
 But later in his career, he is 81kg

1:32:39.660 --> 1:32:42.660
 and it's becoming more and more difficult.

1:32:42.660 --> 1:32:45.660
 So that's the other thing with him.

1:32:45.660 --> 1:32:49.660
 So I've known a lot of really, really tough people

1:32:49.660 --> 1:32:52.660
 at the highest levels broken by the weight cut.

1:32:52.660 --> 1:32:54.660
 Like that can break the toughest minds.

1:32:54.660 --> 1:32:57.660
 And it doesn't seem to have broken him.

1:32:57.660 --> 1:33:02.660
 And he's delivered on it often on like insane weight cuts.

1:33:02.660 --> 1:33:06.660
 So just as a coach, what do you think about his particularly,

1:33:06.660 --> 1:33:09.660
 his mind and the challenge of the weight cut?

1:33:09.660 --> 1:33:11.660
 It was part of his process.

1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:14.660
 It was part of his way of getting ready for battle.

1:33:14.660 --> 1:33:15.660
 Suffering?

1:33:15.660 --> 1:33:17.660
 Yeah, it really was.

1:33:17.660 --> 1:33:19.660
 And if I'm going to suffer this much,

1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:21.660
 then I'm going to make my opponents pay

1:33:21.660 --> 1:33:24.660
 for all the suffering that I went through to get here.

1:33:24.660 --> 1:33:26.660
 That was his mindset.

1:33:26.660 --> 1:33:28.660
 Later on in his career, you're right,

1:33:28.660 --> 1:33:30.660
 like a lot of times Travis,

1:33:30.660 --> 1:33:32.660
 he would never step on a scale

1:33:32.660 --> 1:33:34.660
 until he got to the tournament.

1:33:34.660 --> 1:33:36.660
 And even when he get to the tournament,

1:33:36.660 --> 1:33:38.660
 he'd weigh like 90kg.

1:33:38.660 --> 1:33:41.660
 He'd show up at the tournament, 9kg is over.

1:33:41.660 --> 1:33:43.660
 I'm like, you have to...

1:33:43.660 --> 1:33:46.660
 But it was just an expectation of making weight.

1:33:46.660 --> 1:33:49.660
 Not making weight was never an option for any of our athletes.

1:33:49.660 --> 1:33:51.660
 And Travis knew it.

1:33:51.660 --> 1:33:53.660
 And he said, as a professional,

1:33:53.660 --> 1:33:55.660
 my job is to make weight.

1:33:55.660 --> 1:33:59.660
 If I don't make weight, he was never going to allow that to happen.

1:33:59.660 --> 1:34:02.660
 And he was never going to allow us to come to him and say,

1:34:02.660 --> 1:34:06.660
 hey, I told you, because losing wasn't an option.

1:34:06.660 --> 1:34:10.660
 Not making weight was not an option for him ever either.

1:34:10.660 --> 1:34:13.660
 But a lot of times, he wouldn't even...

1:34:13.660 --> 1:34:17.660
 He'd be 9kg over on the plane going over to the tournament

1:34:17.660 --> 1:34:19.660
 and have to make weight three days later.

1:34:19.660 --> 1:34:22.660
 And he didn't break 86kg

1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:24.660
 until the day before the tournament.

1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:26.660
 He had 5kg over the day before.

1:34:26.660 --> 1:34:27.660
 That was his way.

1:34:27.660 --> 1:34:29.660
 But he would do three workouts.

1:34:29.660 --> 1:34:31.660
 Wake up in the morning, work out.

1:34:31.660 --> 1:34:32.660
 Then he'd eat.

1:34:32.660 --> 1:34:33.660
 Then he'd work out in the afternoon.

1:34:33.660 --> 1:34:34.660
 Then he'd eat again.

1:34:34.660 --> 1:34:36.660
 Then he'd work out again at night.

1:34:36.660 --> 1:34:37.660
 And then he'd reward himself,

1:34:37.660 --> 1:34:38.660
 hey, I worked out three times today.

1:34:38.660 --> 1:34:41.660
 He'd go have a mountain dew.

1:34:41.660 --> 1:34:43.660
 Or a chocolate bar.

1:34:43.660 --> 1:34:47.660
 And then he's next morning, back up to 87kg.

1:34:47.660 --> 1:34:51.660
 He would never touch weight until the morning of Lance.

1:34:51.660 --> 1:34:57.660
 He wasn't on weight for more than five minutes.

1:34:57.660 --> 1:35:00.660
 His process would break a lot of people.

1:35:00.660 --> 1:35:02.660
 So the fact that he got the job done is...

1:35:02.660 --> 1:35:05.660
 Not just the job done, but every single time.

1:35:05.660 --> 1:35:06.660
 Every single time.

1:35:06.660 --> 1:35:07.660
 He got the job done.

1:35:07.660 --> 1:35:09.660
 And I made those athletes fight.

1:35:09.660 --> 1:35:11.660
 We would fight in Paris.

1:35:11.660 --> 1:35:13.660
 We would do a camp for a week.

1:35:13.660 --> 1:35:15.660
 Double session camp for a week.

1:35:15.660 --> 1:35:17.660
 He'd be seven kilos over.

1:35:17.660 --> 1:35:19.660
 Have to fight the next weekend.

1:35:19.660 --> 1:35:21.660
 We're talking two or three days later.

1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:23.660
 So not only did he make the weight,

1:35:23.660 --> 1:35:26.660
 but he did a grueling training camp twice a day.

1:35:26.660 --> 1:35:29.660
 And then cut weight and then fought again.

1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:32.660
 Then did another camp for a week in double session training camp.

1:35:32.660 --> 1:35:34.660
 And then fought on a third weekend in a row.

1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:37.660
 And our athletes went through hell.

1:35:37.660 --> 1:35:41.660
 Because on the tour around the world,

1:35:41.660 --> 1:35:43.660
 they fought in every event.

1:35:43.660 --> 1:35:44.660
 They did every camp.

1:35:44.660 --> 1:35:45.660
 They fought in every event.

1:35:45.660 --> 1:35:47.660
 Whereas most of the other teams,

1:35:47.660 --> 1:35:49.660
 like Japan, comes in and fights in Paris.

1:35:49.660 --> 1:35:50.660
 Then they go home.

1:35:50.660 --> 1:35:52.660
 You know, they maybe do a camp for three days.

1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:53.660
 Then they go home.

1:35:53.660 --> 1:35:56.660
 They don't stay in Europe for four or five weeks straight

1:35:56.660 --> 1:35:57.660
 and fight in every tournament.

1:35:57.660 --> 1:35:58.660
 And when you get to Germany,

1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:00.660
 the Germans skip the French open.

1:36:00.660 --> 1:36:01.660
 They skip the camp in France.

1:36:01.660 --> 1:36:03.660
 They're just getting ready for Germany.

1:36:03.660 --> 1:36:05.660
 Our athletes already had two competitions,

1:36:05.660 --> 1:36:06.660
 two training camps,

1:36:06.660 --> 1:36:08.660
 three weight cuts now.

1:36:08.660 --> 1:36:11.660
 And then, so they're not 100% when they fight in Germany.

1:36:11.660 --> 1:36:13.660
 But that's all part of the experience they need.

1:36:13.660 --> 1:36:16.660
 The training that they need that they don't get here

1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:17.660
 in this country.

1:36:17.660 --> 1:36:19.660
 And all of those were just preparation

1:36:19.660 --> 1:36:22.660
 for our world championships or our Olympic games.

1:36:22.660 --> 1:36:25.660
 So by the time our athletes got to those tournaments,

1:36:25.660 --> 1:36:28.660
 they felt so strong, so rested, so like,

1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:32.660
 man, this guy that felt like a monster in Germany

1:36:32.660 --> 1:36:33.660
 feels like nothing today.

1:36:33.660 --> 1:36:35.660
 Because you're fully rested now.

1:36:35.660 --> 1:36:36.660
 You know?

1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:39.660
 But part of the challenge is because the American team

1:36:39.660 --> 1:36:43.660
 is smaller and more, I mean, just smaller,

1:36:43.660 --> 1:36:47.660
 is, you know, all the different places you go

1:36:47.660 --> 1:36:50.660
 to do the weight cut, to do the diet,

1:36:50.660 --> 1:36:53.660
 to do the preparation or the recovery.

1:36:53.660 --> 1:36:58.660
 There's, like, that process changes every time.

1:36:58.660 --> 1:37:01.660
 So you basically have to improvise a lot.

1:37:01.660 --> 1:37:04.660
 You show up to a hotel and how you do the weight cut,

1:37:04.660 --> 1:37:05.660
 you don't know.

1:37:05.660 --> 1:37:07.660
 And the different weather conditions, it's not,

1:37:07.660 --> 1:37:12.660
 it's like, what is it, Rocky versus Drago, right?

1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:14.660
 So you don't have, you have to just improvise.

1:37:14.660 --> 1:37:16.660
 And that's also a fascinating part

1:37:16.660 --> 1:37:18.660
 of the American judo story, which is like,

1:37:18.660 --> 1:37:19.660
 you have to improvise more.

1:37:19.660 --> 1:37:22.660
 Well, I was funny because when I was 1990,

1:37:22.660 --> 1:37:24.660
 you know, it was at the Goodwill Games, right?

1:37:24.660 --> 1:37:27.660
 And we were, it was a US Olympic committee type event.

1:37:27.660 --> 1:37:30.660
 And so we're on the bus with the swim team.

1:37:30.660 --> 1:37:33.660
 And it was me and Jason Morris on the American team.

1:37:33.660 --> 1:37:35.660
 And we're going to the judo competition,

1:37:35.660 --> 1:37:37.660
 but we're on the bus with the swim team.

1:37:37.660 --> 1:37:39.660
 So we're going to the venue where we're staying.

1:37:39.660 --> 1:37:42.660
 You know, I remember being, like, by ourselves with no staff,

1:37:42.660 --> 1:37:45.660
 no manager, no coach, we're just by ourselves

1:37:45.660 --> 1:37:47.660
 going to fight in Russia, right?

1:37:47.660 --> 1:37:51.660
 And the swim team's on there with their full sweats

1:37:51.660 --> 1:37:54.660
 and their staff and, like, their managers.

1:37:54.660 --> 1:37:57.660
 And I heard the girl go, I'm sorry, this is 1994

1:37:57.660 --> 1:37:59.660
 because it was in St. Petersburg, Russia.

1:37:59.660 --> 1:38:02.660
 So I heard the girl on the team, she goes up the coast,

1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:06.660
 she goes, coach, do you think you can send the massage therapist

1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:07.660
 to my room at 10 a.m.?

1:38:07.660 --> 1:38:09.660
 You know, I'm feeling kind of jet lag.

1:38:09.660 --> 1:38:11.660
 I looked at Jason.

1:38:11.660 --> 1:38:13.660
 We looked at each other and he said, like,

1:38:13.660 --> 1:38:16.660
 she's scheduled on a massage?

1:38:16.660 --> 1:38:17.660
 Yeah.

1:38:17.660 --> 1:38:18.660
 We don't even have a staff.

1:38:18.660 --> 1:38:19.660
 Like, what the hell is going on here?

1:38:19.660 --> 1:38:22.660
 You know, what a difference in sporting,

1:38:22.660 --> 1:38:26.660
 you know, different sports within the same country, you know?

1:38:26.660 --> 1:38:29.660
 But that, I mean, not to romanticize things,

1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:32.660
 but that you do represent the spirit of the Olympics

1:38:32.660 --> 1:38:36.660
 when you're kind of the improvisational nature of it.

1:38:36.660 --> 1:38:38.660
 Because it is just you.

1:38:38.660 --> 1:38:43.660
 You and sometimes you and the coach and just pure guts

1:38:43.660 --> 1:38:46.660
 and you against the world with no money.

1:38:46.660 --> 1:38:48.660
 The warrior spirit.

1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:50.660
 The warrior spirit.

1:38:50.660 --> 1:38:55.660
 How did it feel like when he, after being in two Olympics,

1:38:55.660 --> 1:38:58.660
 beating some of the best people in the world,

1:38:58.660 --> 1:39:00.660
 facing some of the best people in the world

1:39:00.660 --> 1:39:03.660
 and just barely losing,

1:39:03.660 --> 1:39:05.660
 what did it feel like to you as a coach

1:39:05.660 --> 1:39:09.660
 to see Travis Stevens win the silver medal?

1:39:09.660 --> 1:39:11.660
 Electric.

1:39:11.660 --> 1:39:16.660
 Like, first of all, in 2012 in London,

1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:19.660
 it was like, it felt like somebody died.

1:39:19.660 --> 1:39:21.660
 I'm not going to be, I'm not going to lie to you.

1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:23.660
 The Ole Bischoff match?

1:39:23.660 --> 1:39:27.660
 No, just seeing Travis not finish on the podium, period.

1:39:27.660 --> 1:39:29.660
 You know, in the Ole Bischoff match,

1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:32.660
 I thought he won regardless of who won and who lost.

1:39:32.660 --> 1:39:35.660
 He just left everything he had on that map, right?

1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:38.660
 10 minutes of, probably it was a 20 something minute match,

1:39:38.660 --> 1:39:40.660
 but 10 minutes of fighting actually, right?

1:39:40.660 --> 1:39:42.660
 He left everything he had.

1:39:42.660 --> 1:39:44.660
 He wanted to be in the Olympic Finals.

1:39:44.660 --> 1:39:45.660
 He wanted to be an Olympic champion.

1:39:45.660 --> 1:39:47.660
 And when he didn't get that opportunity,

1:39:47.660 --> 1:39:48.660
 he lost everything.

1:39:48.660 --> 1:39:49.660
 He drained himself.

1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:51.660
 He cried for 45 minutes straight.

1:39:51.660 --> 1:39:53.660
 I couldn't regroup him.

1:39:53.660 --> 1:39:54.660
 I couldn't get him up.

1:39:54.660 --> 1:39:56.660
 I said, Travis, you've got to stop your crying.

1:39:56.660 --> 1:39:57.660
 You've got to get off the floor.

1:39:57.660 --> 1:39:59.660
 We've got a bronze medal fight.

1:39:59.660 --> 1:40:03.660
 Like, if you don't recover, you're not going to perform well.

1:40:03.660 --> 1:40:04.660
 And he just didn't care.

1:40:04.660 --> 1:40:06.660
 Like, it was gold or nothing.

1:40:06.660 --> 1:40:09.660
 And so when he walked out against the Canadian boy,

1:40:09.660 --> 1:40:11.660
 he had beaten the Canadian, I think, at that time,

1:40:11.660 --> 1:40:13.660
 he had beaten that Canadian every single time,

1:40:13.660 --> 1:40:15.660
 except for that bronze medal match.

1:40:15.660 --> 1:40:17.660
 But he just didn't have the fight in him anymore.

1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:19.660
 You know, he'd left it all out in the match

1:40:19.660 --> 1:40:20.660
 and the Bischoff match.

1:40:20.660 --> 1:40:22.660
 So to see him come back with zero, right?

1:40:22.660 --> 1:40:25.660
 We just had a team where his best friend,

1:40:25.660 --> 1:40:28.660
 Marty Malloy, won a bronze medal, right?

1:40:28.660 --> 1:40:31.660
 Then the day after Travis fights,

1:40:31.660 --> 1:40:33.660
 Kayla Harrison goes and wins her first gold medal,

1:40:33.660 --> 1:40:34.660
 right, our first ever gold.

1:40:34.660 --> 1:40:36.660
 So we have a gold and a bronze.

1:40:36.660 --> 1:40:38.660
 His training partner wins a gold.

1:40:38.660 --> 1:40:40.660
 His best friend from growing up wins a bronze.

1:40:40.660 --> 1:40:42.660
 He has nothing, right?

1:40:42.660 --> 1:40:46.660
 To see him for four years go through hell,

1:40:46.660 --> 1:40:49.660
 like literally like all of his injuries,

1:40:49.660 --> 1:40:52.660
 every training camp, and then forget the humiliation,

1:40:52.660 --> 1:40:56.660
 because every time any reporter ever came to my dojo,

1:40:56.660 --> 1:40:57.660
 they want to talk to Kayla.

1:40:57.660 --> 1:40:58.660
 She's the Olympic champion.

1:40:58.660 --> 1:40:59.660
 Yeah.

1:40:59.660 --> 1:41:00.660
 Who's this Travis guy?

1:41:00.660 --> 1:41:01.660
 Yeah.

1:41:01.660 --> 1:41:02.660
 You know, who is this guy?

1:41:02.660 --> 1:41:03.660
 You know, so he didn't medal.

1:41:03.660 --> 1:41:05.660
 You know, he's not that important.

1:41:05.660 --> 1:41:08.660
 Up until you get to it right before the Olympics,

1:41:08.660 --> 1:41:11.660
 now they talk about he's an Olympian again.

1:41:11.660 --> 1:41:14.660
 But up until that point, and then every little kid

1:41:14.660 --> 1:41:16.660
 sees Kayla's medal.

1:41:16.660 --> 1:41:18.660
 Oh, Travis, yeah, you went to the Olympics.

1:41:18.660 --> 1:41:19.660
 Where's your medal?

1:41:19.660 --> 1:41:20.660
 How did you do?

1:41:20.660 --> 1:41:22.660
 You know, I took fifth that in place.

1:41:22.660 --> 1:41:25.660
 You know, it's the lowest of low every day

1:41:25.660 --> 1:41:27.660
 having that constant reminder.

1:41:27.660 --> 1:41:32.660
 So four years later, when that guy, I mean,

1:41:32.660 --> 1:41:35.660
 mentally, he was ready.

1:41:35.660 --> 1:41:37.660
 Physically, he was ready.

1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:41.660
 That was the best and strongest Travis Stevens

1:41:41.660 --> 1:41:43.660
 that I've ever seen and I've ever felt.

1:41:43.660 --> 1:41:45.660
 Like, because I had to get on the mat and do some drills

1:41:45.660 --> 1:41:48.660
 and stuff like that and like try to defend on bars

1:41:48.660 --> 1:41:50.660
 and because we didn't have a lot of bodies in Rio.

1:41:50.660 --> 1:41:53.660
 And I was like, my God, I said after one of the brags,

1:41:53.660 --> 1:41:56.660
 they were stronger than I've ever felt that guy, right?

1:41:56.660 --> 1:41:58.660
 Before the competition or physically was ready.

1:41:58.660 --> 1:42:00.660
 Mentally, the morning of competition,

1:42:00.660 --> 1:42:03.660
 I said to Travis, I looked him in the eye and I said,

1:42:03.660 --> 1:42:05.660
 you know, we're ready to go over to the venue.

1:42:05.660 --> 1:42:07.660
 I said, are you ready today?

1:42:07.660 --> 1:42:09.660
 And he just looked at me like he goes,

1:42:09.660 --> 1:42:11.660
 I am going to shock the world today.

1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:13.660
 So he told me, I'm going to shock the world today.

1:42:13.660 --> 1:42:16.660
 And I said, all right, great, let's go, right?

1:42:16.660 --> 1:42:20.660
 So we go to the venue and every other athlete

1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:22.660
 was just like nervously,

1:42:22.660 --> 1:42:24.660
 like doing repetitions of Uchikomis.

1:42:24.660 --> 1:42:26.660
 You could see like sweat coming out.

1:42:26.660 --> 1:42:29.660
 You could see like all this nervous energy

1:42:29.660 --> 1:42:30.660
 going through their body.

1:42:30.660 --> 1:42:32.660
 And here comes Travis Stevens.

1:42:32.660 --> 1:42:34.660
 He's got these big goofy headphones on.

1:42:34.660 --> 1:42:37.660
 He's got a tank top that says USA on it.

1:42:37.660 --> 1:42:40.660
 He's got the swim trunks that say USA

1:42:40.660 --> 1:42:43.660
 like that have shiny letters that glow in the dark.

1:42:43.660 --> 1:42:46.660
 And he's like, and this is in the middle of the judo hall

1:42:46.660 --> 1:42:49.660
 where all these athletes are warming up for their first match.

1:42:49.660 --> 1:42:51.660
 And he's like dancing around,

1:42:51.660 --> 1:42:52.660
 like doing this loose warm up,

1:42:52.660 --> 1:42:55.660
 like almost like a little kid at an amusement park

1:42:55.660 --> 1:42:58.660
 who's dead said, yeah, go play, you know?

1:42:58.660 --> 1:43:01.660
 And it was like he had waited four years for that moment.

1:43:01.660 --> 1:43:06.660
 He was so relaxed, so focused, so relaxed and couldn't wait.

1:43:06.660 --> 1:43:08.660
 It was like a cage tiger.

1:43:08.660 --> 1:43:10.660
 Like if you like coming out of the chute

1:43:10.660 --> 1:43:14.660
 to go step on to the mat was like this tiger

1:43:14.660 --> 1:43:16.660
 that you were just letting out of the cage and he just go.

1:43:16.660 --> 1:43:18.660
 Like now's your time to go fight.

1:43:18.660 --> 1:43:20.660
 And that's what he did that whole day.

1:43:20.660 --> 1:43:24.660
 And like, when he beat Cherokee Chavilly in the semis

1:43:24.660 --> 1:43:27.660
 and choked him out and won that fight,

1:43:27.660 --> 1:43:30.660
 like there's nobody with the exception

1:43:30.660 --> 1:43:33.660
 of maybe the guys in the American team.

1:43:33.660 --> 1:43:35.660
 There was nobody in that stadium

1:43:35.660 --> 1:43:37.660
 that expected Travis to beat him.

1:43:37.660 --> 1:43:38.660
 Nobody.

1:43:38.660 --> 1:43:41.660
 Like, you know, he had smashed Travis,

1:43:41.660 --> 1:43:43.660
 I don't know how many times before that free poem,

1:43:43.660 --> 1:43:46.660
 like in the first minute even, it wasn't even a fight, right?

1:43:46.660 --> 1:43:48.660
 And it was great game plan.

1:43:48.660 --> 1:43:52.660
 He's the world number one at the time too.

1:43:52.660 --> 1:43:56.660
 World number one at the time, world champion,

1:43:56.660 --> 1:43:59.660
 carried the flag for the Georgian Federation

1:43:59.660 --> 1:44:02.660
 walking into the games,

1:44:02.660 --> 1:44:06.660
 the most dominant 81 kilo player in that weight class

1:44:06.660 --> 1:44:10.660
 quite some time and we just had his number

1:44:10.660 --> 1:44:12.660
 and Travis was ready to go.

1:44:12.660 --> 1:44:13.660
 It was so cool.

1:44:13.660 --> 1:44:14.660
 It was so awesome.

1:44:14.660 --> 1:44:16.660
 We had already won,

1:44:16.660 --> 1:44:19.660
 Kayla had already won her second goal, right?

1:44:19.660 --> 1:44:23.660
 The way the event went and Travis winning that

1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:25.660
 was like icing on the cake for our team.

1:44:25.660 --> 1:44:28.660
 That was the best performance we've ever had in history.

1:44:28.660 --> 1:44:29.660
 It's awesome.

1:44:29.660 --> 1:44:30.660
 So you mentioned Kayla.

1:44:30.660 --> 1:44:35.660
 She is one of, if not the greatest American judoka ever.

1:44:35.660 --> 1:44:38.660
 Two time gold medalist.

1:44:38.660 --> 1:44:41.660
 2010 world champion.

1:44:41.660 --> 1:44:42.660
 2010.

1:44:42.660 --> 1:44:43.660
 For senior worlds.

1:44:43.660 --> 1:44:44.660
 Senior worlds.

1:44:44.660 --> 1:44:48.660
 What makes Kayla special?

1:44:48.660 --> 1:44:50.660
 What makes her so great?

1:44:50.660 --> 1:44:53.660
 What made this champion?

1:44:53.660 --> 1:44:56.660
 It's a combination of a lot of things.

1:44:56.660 --> 1:45:00.660
 One was obviously Kayla's mental toughness, right?

1:45:00.660 --> 1:45:03.660
 To overcome what she overcame.

1:45:03.660 --> 1:45:05.660
 This is a girl who,

1:45:05.660 --> 1:45:09.660
 I don't want to say forget about the sexual abuse,

1:45:09.660 --> 1:45:12.660
 but the fact that she had to go through that in life

1:45:12.660 --> 1:45:15.660
 and learned how to compartmentalize that

1:45:15.660 --> 1:45:18.660
 and keep that off as a separate part of her brain

1:45:18.660 --> 1:45:20.660
 and forget about it and move on.

1:45:20.660 --> 1:45:23.660
 That took an incredible team to help her do that

1:45:23.660 --> 1:45:27.660
 and my dad was a huge part of her accomplishing that.

1:45:27.660 --> 1:45:29.660
 So for people who don't know it,

1:45:29.660 --> 1:45:32.660
 we should comment and say that Kayla had to go through trauma

1:45:32.660 --> 1:45:36.660
 in her earlier life through sexual abuse

1:45:36.660 --> 1:45:39.660
 and had to overcome that through the whole process

1:45:39.660 --> 1:45:42.660
 of becoming a champion as well.

1:45:42.660 --> 1:45:45.660
 Because she had zero self esteem, zero self worth.

1:45:45.660 --> 1:45:47.660
 She was at the lowest of lows

1:45:47.660 --> 1:45:51.660
 and didn't even want to be on this earth, right?

1:45:51.660 --> 1:45:54.660
 So she was traumatized obviously

1:45:54.660 --> 1:45:56.660
 and getting her the right help

1:45:56.660 --> 1:45:58.660
 and surrounding her with the right people

1:45:58.660 --> 1:46:00.660
 who could help her get through that

1:46:00.660 --> 1:46:03.660
 and be by her side as she's getting through that

1:46:03.660 --> 1:46:05.660
 and letting her know and reaffirming

1:46:05.660 --> 1:46:07.660
 that she's doing the right thing

1:46:07.660 --> 1:46:09.660
 and she made the right decision

1:46:09.660 --> 1:46:11.660
 and she should have zero guilt

1:46:11.660 --> 1:46:13.660
 and this doesn't define her.

1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:15.660
 It happened to her, but it doesn't define her.

1:46:15.660 --> 1:46:17.660
 What defines her is what she does from now on

1:46:17.660 --> 1:46:20.660
 and then rebuilding that person to become who she became.

1:46:20.660 --> 1:46:25.660
 I think the mental toughness is a big part of it, her mind.

1:46:25.660 --> 1:46:29.660
 But then as an athlete,

1:46:29.660 --> 1:46:31.660
 she's a lot like Travis.

1:46:31.660 --> 1:46:33.660
 She's a warrior.

1:46:33.660 --> 1:46:34.660
 She's a fighter.

1:46:34.660 --> 1:46:36.660
 My dad always jokes with her.

1:46:36.660 --> 1:46:38.660
 He says, you're a workhorse.

1:46:38.660 --> 1:46:39.660
 You're not a thoroughbred.

1:46:39.660 --> 1:46:41.660
 We're not going to treat you like a thoroughbred, right?

1:46:41.660 --> 1:46:44.660
 You're a workhorse, so you're going to work.

1:46:44.660 --> 1:46:46.660
 And the way you're going to get bigger and stronger

1:46:46.660 --> 1:46:48.660
 is you're going to work harder and you're going to keep...

1:46:48.660 --> 1:46:50.660
 And she came to us when she was only 15.

1:46:50.660 --> 1:46:52.660
 So at that time, we got her

1:46:52.660 --> 1:46:54.660
 with a really good strength and conditioning coach.

1:46:54.660 --> 1:46:57.660
 We did all the core Olympic style lifting.

1:46:57.660 --> 1:46:59.660
 As her body was developing,

1:46:59.660 --> 1:47:01.660
 she was getting stronger every single day.

1:47:01.660 --> 1:47:05.660
 And then she had the luxury of being on the mat with...

1:47:05.660 --> 1:47:07.660
 At the time, I was still young enough to train

1:47:07.660 --> 1:47:09.660
 and be on the mat and I was around her weight class

1:47:09.660 --> 1:47:11.660
 and Travis was able to train with her

1:47:11.660 --> 1:47:14.660
 and we had all the top U.S. athletes at the time

1:47:14.660 --> 1:47:16.660
 training here at my school.

1:47:16.660 --> 1:47:18.660
 So she got the benefit of all the best guys

1:47:18.660 --> 1:47:20.660
 to train with in the country.

1:47:20.660 --> 1:47:23.660
 And her doing all of those rounds,

1:47:23.660 --> 1:47:27.660
 night and week, night every night, every week,

1:47:27.660 --> 1:47:29.660
 every year, compiled with the best,

1:47:29.660 --> 1:47:32.660
 highest level she could as a girl.

1:47:32.660 --> 1:47:34.660
 She got the strength, she got the technique,

1:47:34.660 --> 1:47:36.660
 and then she had the coaching on top of it

1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:38.660
 with my dad being on her as working her out

1:47:38.660 --> 1:47:42.660
 and having the wherewithal to develop a strategy

1:47:42.660 --> 1:47:44.660
 and a plan for her.

1:47:44.660 --> 1:47:46.660
 Because when she first came here,

1:47:46.660 --> 1:47:50.660
 she competed at 63 kilos, which is 138 pounds.

1:47:50.660 --> 1:47:54.660
 At the time, Rhonda Rousey was also training here

1:47:54.660 --> 1:47:56.660
 and she was 70 kilos.

1:47:56.660 --> 1:47:59.660
 So if Kayla was struggling making 63,

1:47:59.660 --> 1:48:01.660
 so the only way to, obviously,

1:48:01.660 --> 1:48:03.660
 the only way to still compete is to move up.

1:48:03.660 --> 1:48:05.660
 But my dad said, well, if you move up,

1:48:05.660 --> 1:48:07.660
 then you're in Rhonda's weight, so let's skip that weight

1:48:07.660 --> 1:48:09.660
 and you're gonna go to 78 kilos.

1:48:09.660 --> 1:48:11.660
 And he told her, listen, you're gonna go up two weight classes.

1:48:11.660 --> 1:48:14.660
 She looked at him and was like, that's 172 pounds.

1:48:14.660 --> 1:48:16.660
 And he goes, well, I don't care.

1:48:16.660 --> 1:48:19.660
 Like, you're already struggling making 138,

1:48:19.660 --> 1:48:21.660
 weight 150, what's the difference?

1:48:21.660 --> 1:48:23.660
 We put 20 pounds on, go to 170.

1:48:23.660 --> 1:48:25.660
 So that's why she jumped two weights

1:48:25.660 --> 1:48:27.660
 because she passed Rhonda and she went to the weight above

1:48:27.660 --> 1:48:29.660
 so she could make the national team

1:48:29.660 --> 1:48:32.660
 and she had a chance to go to the Olympics and all that

1:48:32.660 --> 1:48:35.660
 because we envisioned Rhonda staying around till 2012.

1:48:35.660 --> 1:48:37.660
 And that's also like a long term vision

1:48:37.660 --> 1:48:40.660
 because you kind of grow into that body then over time.

1:48:40.660 --> 1:48:41.660
 Correct.

1:48:41.660 --> 1:48:42.660
 So you can dominate.

1:48:42.660 --> 1:48:44.660
 You can learn what it's like in that weight class.

1:48:44.660 --> 1:48:46.660
 You can learn to dominate that weight class,

1:48:46.660 --> 1:48:48.660
 excel and then dominate.

1:48:48.660 --> 1:48:50.660
 If you don't get too hard too long,

1:48:50.660 --> 1:48:51.660
 they forget about technique

1:48:51.660 --> 1:48:53.660
 because they're only worried about losing weight.

1:48:53.660 --> 1:48:54.660
 They're always tired in training.

1:48:54.660 --> 1:48:56.660
 They don't give 100% effort.

1:48:56.660 --> 1:48:57.660
 They're not getting better.

1:48:57.660 --> 1:49:00.660
 She now is just focused on getting better at judo

1:49:00.660 --> 1:49:02.660
 and getting bigger, getting stronger, getting more powerful.

1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:04.660
 So I think giving her that purpose

1:49:04.660 --> 1:49:07.660
 and that was a great call.

1:49:07.660 --> 1:49:09.660
 What are some memorable

1:49:09.660 --> 1:49:11.660
 or maybe the most memorable moment,

1:49:11.660 --> 1:49:16.660
 Kayla Harrison moment to you as her coach?

1:49:16.660 --> 1:49:18.660
 Not the most perhaps, let's say.

1:49:18.660 --> 1:49:21.660
 What are some memorable moments?

1:49:21.660 --> 1:49:23.660
 Everybody hears the good ones, right?

1:49:23.660 --> 1:49:28.660
 So everybody knows she won the World Championships in Tokyo in 2010.

1:49:28.660 --> 1:49:31.660
 She was our two time Olympic champion in 2012, 2016.

1:49:31.660 --> 1:49:33.660
 I'll never forget those moments, right?

1:49:33.660 --> 1:49:35.660
 Because they're historic.

1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:40.660
 One of the biggest moments that I like sharing this story with everybody

1:49:40.660 --> 1:49:45.660
 is that in 2010 in January,

1:49:45.660 --> 1:49:47.660
 Kayla was still a developing athlete

1:49:47.660 --> 1:49:49.660
 and we had a local tournament in New York.

1:49:49.660 --> 1:49:52.660
 It was in Brooklyn, New York, it was called the Sterrett Cup.

1:49:52.660 --> 1:49:54.660
 And I knew that at that tournament

1:49:54.660 --> 1:49:56.660
 that two of the Canadian girls,

1:49:56.660 --> 1:49:59.660
 they were like ranked 15th or 20th in the world.

1:49:59.660 --> 1:50:01.660
 They weren't superstars, but they were tough players.

1:50:01.660 --> 1:50:04.660
 Both of them, I knew were going to be at that tournament.

1:50:04.660 --> 1:50:06.660
 So I said, Kayla, we're going to go to this tournament.

1:50:06.660 --> 1:50:08.660
 You're going to compete against the Canadian girls,

1:50:08.660 --> 1:50:09.660
 get some good experience,

1:50:09.660 --> 1:50:11.660
 figure out what you need to work on,

1:50:11.660 --> 1:50:13.660
 and then we'll go home and work on some stuff.

1:50:13.660 --> 1:50:15.660
 Well, she went to the tournament.

1:50:15.660 --> 1:50:17.660
 There was only three girls in the weight, her and the two Canadians.

1:50:17.660 --> 1:50:21.660
 At that tournament, she lost both fights.

1:50:21.660 --> 1:50:24.660
 So this is January 2010.

1:50:24.660 --> 1:50:26.660
 She lost both matches.

1:50:26.660 --> 1:50:29.660
 She was competitive, but certainly things she needed to work on.

1:50:29.660 --> 1:50:32.660
 It was good development thing for her and for us.

1:50:32.660 --> 1:50:34.660
 It also opened her mind to say, oh man,

1:50:34.660 --> 1:50:39.660
 because she was already a junior world champion at the time.

1:50:39.660 --> 1:50:41.660
 But so now there's another level.

1:50:41.660 --> 1:50:42.660
 This is a senior level, right?

1:50:42.660 --> 1:50:45.660
 Here's two girls that aren't even medalists that are beating you.

1:50:45.660 --> 1:50:47.660
 So now there's more work to be done.

1:50:47.660 --> 1:50:51.660
 And so I like telling that story because everybody sees the champions

1:50:51.660 --> 1:50:52.660
 in the greatest moments.

1:50:52.660 --> 1:50:54.660
 They don't see them when they have bad days.

1:50:54.660 --> 1:50:57.660
 And can you imagine being, you know, 0 and 2?

1:50:57.660 --> 1:51:00.660
 You feel like, you feel like a failure, right?

1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:06.660
 But 10 months later was Tokyo 2010.

1:51:06.660 --> 1:51:09.660
 She went from 0 and 2 at Starrette, New York,

1:51:09.660 --> 1:51:15.660
 to world champion 2010 in the motherland in Japan.

1:51:15.660 --> 1:51:18.660
 I mean, that's an amazing turnaround.

1:51:18.660 --> 1:51:23.660
 And that's only possible if you put the losses in their proper context.

1:51:23.660 --> 1:51:27.660
 You don't let it destroy your mentally and just keep moving forward.

1:51:27.660 --> 1:51:28.660
 Correct.

1:51:28.660 --> 1:51:30.660
 This is so funny.

1:51:30.660 --> 1:51:33.660
 So you were there at 2010 at the Starrette Cup?

1:51:33.660 --> 1:51:35.660
 Was Travis there?

1:51:35.660 --> 1:51:36.660
 Yeah.

1:51:36.660 --> 1:51:40.660
 I made all those, we fought at every, like the mentality of our team

1:51:40.660 --> 1:51:43.660
 was no tournament is beneath us.

1:51:43.660 --> 1:51:47.660
 If our goal is to go to the Olympics in the world and win,

1:51:47.660 --> 1:51:49.660
 there's no tournament that's beneath us.

1:51:49.660 --> 1:51:50.660
 We're going to get experience.

1:51:50.660 --> 1:51:51.660
 We're going to fight.

1:51:51.660 --> 1:51:52.660
 We're going to learn.

1:51:52.660 --> 1:51:53.660
 We're going to compete.

1:51:53.660 --> 1:51:55.660
 We're going to get better, you know?

1:51:55.660 --> 1:52:00.660
 I actually just, as a funny little side, I was there.

1:52:00.660 --> 1:52:01.660
 I competed.

1:52:01.660 --> 1:52:02.660
 Really?

1:52:02.660 --> 1:52:05.660
 This is one of the earlier tournaments, like the beginner division.

1:52:05.660 --> 1:52:08.660
 No, I actually did Black Belt division too.

1:52:08.660 --> 1:52:11.660
 That was one of the, actually, yeah, I remember that.

1:52:11.660 --> 1:52:18.660
 That's when it was so early that I thought, like, I was also really strong at that time,

1:52:18.660 --> 1:52:20.660
 just like physically, like powerlifting stuff.

1:52:20.660 --> 1:52:26.660
 So I thought, like, it'll be good experience to also do Black Belt division.

1:52:26.660 --> 1:52:31.660
 And remember, it must have been actually Travis's division, which is funny.

1:52:31.660 --> 1:52:35.660
 There's Legere Brothers.

1:52:35.660 --> 1:52:38.660
 They are super, they're super good and they're super dominant.

1:52:38.660 --> 1:52:43.660
 But I think Travis faced one of them and beat them.

1:52:43.660 --> 1:52:44.660
 I don't know.

1:52:44.660 --> 1:52:50.660
 I just remembered, it's funny how there's just like these little roads that later reconnect.

1:52:50.660 --> 1:52:51.660
 Right.

1:52:51.660 --> 1:52:54.660
 But yeah, there's some incredible people there.

1:52:54.660 --> 1:52:57.660
 And I saw, obviously, the positive things.

1:52:57.660 --> 1:53:01.660
 And it's interesting that Kayla's story was also intersecting there.

1:53:01.660 --> 1:53:04.660
 And that was one of the lower points for her.

1:53:04.660 --> 1:53:09.660
 Another story I like to share is that you have to know your athletes, right?

1:53:09.660 --> 1:53:14.660
 And you have to, you know, really get to know their psychology, what they're thinking psychologically,

1:53:14.660 --> 1:53:16.660
 mentally, what's going through their head.

1:53:16.660 --> 1:53:19.660
 Another story was in Tokyo.

1:53:19.660 --> 1:53:25.660
 It was 2015, the Tokyo Grand Slam.

1:53:25.660 --> 1:53:30.660
 So we had had Kayla face off against almost all the top girls in her division.

1:53:30.660 --> 1:53:33.660
 She had meeting everybody going into the 2016 Olympics.

1:53:33.660 --> 1:53:41.660
 But at the 2015 Tokyo Grand Slam, there was a girl from Japan that she hadn't fought in a long time

1:53:41.660 --> 1:53:44.660
 and she lost to the girl last time she fought her.

1:53:44.660 --> 1:53:48.660
 So it was something we wanted her to beat this girl going into the Olympics

1:53:48.660 --> 1:53:51.660
 so that she knew she could beat everybody.

1:53:51.660 --> 1:53:57.660
 And it was a first round match and it was going to be tough for Kayla, right?

1:53:57.660 --> 1:53:59.660
 It was going to be a really hard fight.

1:53:59.660 --> 1:54:02.660
 And she had won a bunch of tournaments in a row leading up to that.

1:54:02.660 --> 1:54:09.660
 So her confidence was really high, but at the same time, she didn't think she needed this fight.

1:54:09.660 --> 1:54:14.660
 And she showed up to the tournament and she said, I don't think I can fight today.

1:54:14.660 --> 1:54:18.660
 I've got a stinger in my neck, you know, I've got a stinger coming down my neck

1:54:18.660 --> 1:54:21.660
 and I'm kind of sore and she didn't tell us.

1:54:21.660 --> 1:54:25.660
 She went and told the trainer, she walked around, she's holding her neck

1:54:25.660 --> 1:54:27.660
 and me and my dad were like, what's up with her?

1:54:27.660 --> 1:54:28.660
 I don't know.

1:54:28.660 --> 1:54:32.660
 And then so, like, I don't know, maybe she doesn't want to fight today.

1:54:32.660 --> 1:54:33.660
 I don't know, right?

1:54:33.660 --> 1:54:36.660
 So all of a sudden, the trainer comes up to us and she didn't come to us.

1:54:36.660 --> 1:54:41.660
 The trainer came to us and says, you know, I really don't think it's a good idea that Kayla fight today.

1:54:41.660 --> 1:54:45.660
 And we looked at him and like, well, your opinion doesn't really matter, does it?

1:54:45.660 --> 1:54:46.660
 Right?

1:54:46.660 --> 1:54:47.660
 Like, what's up with her?

1:54:47.660 --> 1:54:48.660
 Yeah.

1:54:48.660 --> 1:54:51.660
 Well, she has this thing in her neck, it's like a pinched nerve and there's this and

1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:53.660
 then we talked.

1:54:53.660 --> 1:54:56.660
 I said, is there a risk of her getting injured?

1:54:56.660 --> 1:54:59.660
 Like, is this pain or is this risk that she's going to get injured and she's going to set

1:54:59.660 --> 1:55:01.660
 her back like long time in her career?

1:55:01.660 --> 1:55:03.660
 She says, no, she's not going to get injured.

1:55:03.660 --> 1:55:04.660
 Just a pinched nerve.

1:55:04.660 --> 1:55:06.660
 It was a little pain she's going to have to deal with.

1:55:06.660 --> 1:55:08.660
 I go, okay, well, can you fix the pain?

1:55:08.660 --> 1:55:13.660
 She says, yeah, I can do this and that and I can give her a shot and the pain will go away.

1:55:13.660 --> 1:55:14.660
 Okay, then do that.

1:55:14.660 --> 1:55:18.660
 And so Kayla, Kayla comes up and she goes, didn't the trainer talk to you?

1:55:18.660 --> 1:55:19.660
 I said, yeah, he talked to us.

1:55:19.660 --> 1:55:21.660
 Well, he said, I can't fight.

1:55:21.660 --> 1:55:27.660
 I don't know, but we already talked to the trainer and he said, you're good to go.

1:55:27.660 --> 1:55:32.660
 She looked at us like, and then we had to talk to her and say, listen, you're not injured,

1:55:32.660 --> 1:55:35.660
 you're in pain because we just came from a camp.

1:55:35.660 --> 1:55:37.660
 I said, you're in pain, but here's the deal.

1:55:37.660 --> 1:55:38.660
 We want you to fight this girl.

1:55:38.660 --> 1:55:40.660
 Why don't you go out there and beat this girl?

1:55:40.660 --> 1:55:41.660
 Period.

1:55:41.660 --> 1:55:42.660
 I don't care.

1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:43.660
 I want to know that you can beat this girl.

1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:44.660
 This is why we came.

1:55:44.660 --> 1:55:47.660
 This is our last hard tournament before the Olympic Games.

1:55:47.660 --> 1:55:49.660
 This is what we want from you.

1:55:49.660 --> 1:55:52.660
 And lo and behold, she understood.

1:55:52.660 --> 1:55:54.660
 They gave her a quick shot.

1:55:54.660 --> 1:55:58.660
 The rest of the world thought we were crazy making her compete.

1:55:58.660 --> 1:56:00.660
 And then she went out there.

1:56:00.660 --> 1:56:01.660
 She fought.

1:56:01.660 --> 1:56:03.660
 Didn't even know she was injured.

1:56:03.660 --> 1:56:04.660
 You know what I mean?

1:56:04.660 --> 1:56:05.660
 She just went out there.

1:56:05.660 --> 1:56:06.660
 She fought the tournament.

1:56:06.660 --> 1:56:07.660
 She beat the Japanese girls.

1:56:07.660 --> 1:56:09.660
 She ended up going through the whole tournament.

1:56:09.660 --> 1:56:11.660
 She took a gold medal.

1:56:11.660 --> 1:56:13.660
 She won the event.

1:56:13.660 --> 1:56:16.660
 That turned out to be a great confidence builder.

1:56:16.660 --> 1:56:17.660
 Yeah.

1:56:17.660 --> 1:56:22.660
 And that kind of sets you up for all of the chaos that can happen at the Olympic Games.

1:56:22.660 --> 1:56:27.660
 And it tells you, if you can beat these girls when you're not a hundred percent and you're

1:56:27.660 --> 1:56:32.660
 not at your best, you're physically beat, mentally beat, imagine what you're going to do when

1:56:32.660 --> 1:56:33.660
 you're fresh.

1:56:33.660 --> 1:56:35.660
 Well, when she was going into the Olympic Games, there's a lot.

1:56:35.660 --> 1:56:37.660
 She had the mental game.

1:56:37.660 --> 1:56:38.660
 Down.

1:56:38.660 --> 1:56:39.660
 Down.

1:56:39.660 --> 1:56:42.660
 There wasn't a girl in that division that thought they could beat Kayla going into those

1:56:42.660 --> 1:56:43.660
 games.

1:56:43.660 --> 1:56:44.660
 Not a one.

1:56:44.660 --> 1:56:46.660
 They just looked at her and went, no, not happening.

1:56:46.660 --> 1:56:47.660
 Yeah.

1:56:47.660 --> 1:56:48.660
 It's great.

1:56:48.660 --> 1:56:51.660
 I mean, she's a great Olympic champion, two time Olympic champion.

1:56:51.660 --> 1:56:59.380
 But there is something that she's commented on, which is she's suffered or went through

1:56:59.380 --> 1:57:02.580
 depression after winning her second Olympic gold.

1:57:02.580 --> 1:57:04.500
 Why do you think this happens?

1:57:04.500 --> 1:57:11.140
 You often hear stories of great champions becoming depressed after the Olympics.

1:57:11.140 --> 1:57:14.580
 There's a lack of purpose afterwards, right?

1:57:14.580 --> 1:57:18.620
 Because you've done in life what you set out to do.

1:57:18.620 --> 1:57:20.660
 You've had a goal every day you woke up.

1:57:20.660 --> 1:57:22.020
 You knew what your purpose was.

1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:26.020
 You knew what your day looked like.

1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:28.100
 You knew why you were doing that.

1:57:28.100 --> 1:57:33.900
 And all of a sudden you won and you got all the fame and you're all happy.

1:57:33.900 --> 1:57:37.860
 But then you wake up and you go, now what?

1:57:37.860 --> 1:57:39.820
 I don't have a next.

1:57:39.820 --> 1:57:45.580
 And also because there was nothing for her, there was no, there was no path set out for

1:57:45.580 --> 1:57:51.860
 Kayla that said, okay, you're going to become an ambassador, a global ambassador of Judo.

1:57:51.860 --> 1:57:54.340
 The IJF is going to help pay a salary.

1:57:54.340 --> 1:57:56.460
 The USA Judo is going to give you a salary.

1:57:56.460 --> 1:57:58.500
 Here's what we want you to go teach children.

1:57:58.500 --> 1:58:01.140
 We want you to go be an ambassador for women.

1:58:01.140 --> 1:58:04.940
 We're going to fly you around and whatever it is, we're going to give you a job and

1:58:04.940 --> 1:58:07.660
 here's what you're going to do if you'd like to take it.

1:58:07.660 --> 1:58:09.540
 There was nothing for her.

1:58:09.540 --> 1:58:13.700
 I remember doing the interview at the Olympics with her and they said, are you going to compete

1:58:13.700 --> 1:58:14.700
 in the next Olympics?

1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:15.700
 And I said, no.

1:58:15.700 --> 1:58:16.700
 Why?

1:58:16.700 --> 1:58:18.300
 She's already two time gold medalist.

1:58:18.300 --> 1:58:20.180
 What does three time gold medalist do for her?

1:58:20.180 --> 1:58:21.180
 Nothing, right?

1:58:21.180 --> 1:58:23.940
 It doesn't motivate her to do it again.

1:58:23.940 --> 1:58:24.940
 They said, are you doing MMA?

1:58:24.940 --> 1:58:25.940
 I said, no.

1:58:25.940 --> 1:58:26.940
 Why would she do MMA?

1:58:26.940 --> 1:58:28.340
 That's ridiculous.

1:58:28.340 --> 1:58:29.340
 She doesn't need MMA.

1:58:29.340 --> 1:58:34.380
 She should be able to make a living off of what she's accomplished in this sport for

1:58:34.380 --> 1:58:36.220
 the rest of her life.

1:58:36.220 --> 1:58:41.740
 But what happens is, and when most people don't understand is, once you say, I'm retired,

1:58:41.740 --> 1:58:45.860
 I'm no longer competing in the sport of Judo.

1:58:45.860 --> 1:58:51.060
 You don't get a salary from USA Judo anymore, which she was getting.

1:58:51.060 --> 1:58:56.140
 I think she got like $72,000 a year from USA Judo at the time.

1:58:56.140 --> 1:59:01.420
 You don't get a stipend from the Olympic committee anymore, goes away.

1:59:01.420 --> 1:59:05.260
 Your sponsor, like the New York Athletic Club, was a great sponsor for her for all those

1:59:05.260 --> 1:59:06.260
 years.

1:59:06.260 --> 1:59:10.860
 In fact, she could have never been the athlete she became without the support of the NYC.

1:59:10.860 --> 1:59:15.100
 Because I talked to them when she was 15, I said, hey, I got a girl that's really good

1:59:15.100 --> 1:59:16.100
 someday.

1:59:16.100 --> 1:59:20.660
 If you invest in her now, I promise you she'll pay back for you.

1:59:20.660 --> 1:59:23.660
 And I remember the day she won the Olympic gold, I called the guy up, I said, hey, I

1:59:23.660 --> 1:59:24.660
 told you.

1:59:24.660 --> 1:59:30.340
 So, but they can no longer give you stipends because you're not competing and representing

1:59:30.340 --> 1:59:31.340
 them anymore.

1:59:31.340 --> 1:59:33.700
 So that goes away.

1:59:33.700 --> 1:59:37.940
 All of your sponsorships and all of your money that you would make from your TV commercials

1:59:37.940 --> 1:59:42.860
 or whatever, that didn't happen for her after the Olympics because Judo's an obscure sport.

1:59:42.860 --> 1:59:45.180
 So she didn't have any opportunities for that.

1:59:45.180 --> 1:59:48.900
 But at the end of the day, she has no revenue coming in.

1:59:48.900 --> 1:59:49.900
 How do you live?

1:59:49.900 --> 1:59:54.700
 You got a bonus of 25 grand from the Olympic committee or whatever for winning a gold,

1:59:54.700 --> 1:59:57.060
 but aside from that, you're not going to live on that money.

1:59:57.060 --> 2:00:00.220
 So no purpose, no goal, right?

2:00:00.220 --> 2:00:01.660
 What am I going to wake up and do tomorrow?

2:00:01.660 --> 2:00:02.660
 I don't know.

2:00:02.660 --> 2:00:03.660
 So she has no direction.

2:00:03.660 --> 2:00:06.540
 And at the same, then at the same time, she has no money coming in.

2:00:06.540 --> 2:00:07.740
 So everything shuts off.

2:00:07.740 --> 2:00:09.860
 So now it's like, where do you turn?

2:00:09.860 --> 2:00:10.860
 What do you do?

2:00:10.860 --> 2:00:16.180
 You know, and that leads to being depressed because yeah, even though I've accomplished

2:00:16.180 --> 2:00:19.020
 all this stuff, I'm kind of lost in life.

2:00:19.020 --> 2:00:20.580
 Like what's next for me?

2:00:20.580 --> 2:00:27.460
 And I guess you just have to ride that out because when you're a great human being, great

2:00:27.460 --> 2:00:32.340
 champion, life has a way of helping you find a way.

2:00:32.340 --> 2:00:36.740
 I mean, she's in mixed martial arts now, but she has a lot of stuff going on.

2:00:36.740 --> 2:00:37.740
 Right.

2:00:37.740 --> 2:00:41.460
 Well, her kids, she adopted her sister's kids.

2:00:41.460 --> 2:00:43.260
 So she's their legal guardian now.

2:00:43.260 --> 2:00:44.860
 So that is her purpose, right?

2:00:44.860 --> 2:00:47.700
 Raising these kids and making them part of her family.

2:00:47.700 --> 2:00:52.740
 And she's fortunate enough that she has enough money, that she can do that and she can give

2:00:52.740 --> 2:00:53.740
 them a good life.

2:00:53.740 --> 2:00:58.660
 I'm going to ask you to start some trouble, but I heard that she said somewhere that

2:00:58.660 --> 2:01:02.060
 she can be Khabib Narmagomedov in judo.

2:01:02.060 --> 2:01:03.220
 What do you think?

2:01:03.220 --> 2:01:06.460
 To be honest with you, I mean, I don't know what level of judoka.

2:01:06.460 --> 2:01:07.460
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:01:07.460 --> 2:01:08.460
 I don't know what level he is.

2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:13.340
 But I do know that that Russian system respects judo immensely.

2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:18.300
 What I will tell you is this, I trained with Kayla and I was an Olympic medalist and a

2:01:18.300 --> 2:01:20.300
 world champion in judo.

2:01:20.300 --> 2:01:24.860
 And granted, I was older when I trained with her, but you have to go as a man.

2:01:24.860 --> 2:01:29.460
 You have to go 100% or she will smash you as a man.

2:01:29.460 --> 2:01:34.740
 And I could tell you that if Khabib doesn't do a lot of just judo, doesn't like, you

2:01:34.740 --> 2:01:39.020
 know, gripping and doesn't understand, like, if he, you know, if he can throw, that's one

2:01:39.020 --> 2:01:45.020
 thing, but if he doesn't really understand judo at a high level, she will throw him.

2:01:45.020 --> 2:01:49.260
 She would beat him in a match in a judo contest, not in a mixed martial arts contest, not in

2:01:49.260 --> 2:01:54.780
 a wrestling contest, not in a submission contest, in a pure judo match where he cannot grab

2:01:54.780 --> 2:01:59.900
 legs and he has to grip up and just throw.

2:01:59.900 --> 2:02:05.300
 I'd put my money on Kayla, unless he's, you know, if he could go place in the nationals

2:02:05.300 --> 2:02:06.780
 in Russia, he would beat her.

2:02:06.780 --> 2:02:11.220
 But if he's not at that level of judo, he's more like a brown belt or he's not, he's not

2:02:11.220 --> 2:02:13.020
 a high level judo player, she will win.

2:02:13.020 --> 2:02:20.220
 I saw her take some of our best juniors in this country, some of the, some of the guys

2:02:20.220 --> 2:02:23.540
 that went and won our, meddled in our senior nationals.

2:02:23.540 --> 2:02:26.740
 I've seen her smash all of them in judo.

2:02:26.740 --> 2:02:29.700
 Now she's not going to do that to a Travis Steven.

2:02:29.700 --> 2:02:34.940
 She's not going to do that, you know, to a, to a senior national champion, you know,

2:02:34.940 --> 2:02:40.820
 or an Olympian in our sport, but she will go toe to toe with every other male, if black

2:02:40.820 --> 2:02:44.100
 belts are not.

2:02:44.100 --> 2:02:51.740
 Speaking of Khabib in Russia, Vladimir Putin, I don't know if you have heard of him.

2:02:51.740 --> 2:02:55.740
 He's the president of Russia, but he's also a judoka.

2:02:55.740 --> 2:02:58.500
 Have you gotten a chance to see him do judo?

2:02:58.500 --> 2:03:01.380
 What do you think about his judo, if you were to analyze it?

2:03:01.380 --> 2:03:07.140
 I'm actually really good friends with the, the Russian Federation, uh, the, the guy in

2:03:07.140 --> 2:03:08.980
 charge is Ezio Gamba.

2:03:08.980 --> 2:03:09.980
 He's an Italian.

2:03:09.980 --> 2:03:15.900
 He's a mastermind behind their success of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams, 2020.

2:03:15.900 --> 2:03:18.540
 He suffered from leukemia, blood cancer.

2:03:18.540 --> 2:03:24.260
 So he wasn't part of their 2020 program, but he was part of 2012, 2016, that whole national,

2:03:24.260 --> 2:03:30.420
 the Olympic team in 2012 came to our studio and lived here for a month in Boston.

2:03:30.420 --> 2:03:31.860
 They went to school in Boston.

2:03:31.860 --> 2:03:40.100
 I brought them to my house, they had three Olympic champions, um, they all came and lived

2:03:40.100 --> 2:03:41.460
 here in Boston for a month.

2:03:41.460 --> 2:03:45.460
 They wanted to be part of like experience America type program.

2:03:45.460 --> 2:03:50.940
 So I've seen all of them with Putin in Russia at their national training center, working

2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:53.740
 out with them and taking falls and doing judo with him.

2:03:53.740 --> 2:03:58.020
 So, um, you know, it's hard when you're older to move in judo.

2:03:58.020 --> 2:04:02.940
 I mean, I was at a high level and I'm, you know, now 51, it's hard for me to move like

2:04:02.940 --> 2:04:03.940
 I used to.

2:04:03.940 --> 2:04:09.020
 So at his age, he's got to be what, 60, between 62, 65 ish.

2:04:09.020 --> 2:04:14.340
 I mean, it moves really well for somebody that's that age, you know, and probably hasn't

2:04:14.340 --> 2:04:17.860
 done very much judo for the last, how have many years, right?

2:04:17.860 --> 2:04:21.300
 So that tells you he, at one point you had to be a really good judo player.

2:04:21.300 --> 2:04:22.300
 Yeah.

2:04:22.300 --> 2:04:25.220
 He put in a lot of work at some point to develop the technique.

2:04:25.220 --> 2:04:31.100
 You could tell when a great judo player, even if they haven't practiced it, even if they're

2:04:31.100 --> 2:04:36.100
 up there in age, like just the way they move, the way they go in for a say, nagi, the way

2:04:36.100 --> 2:04:40.300
 they go for a particular throw, the way they do foot sweeps and all that kind of stuff.

2:04:40.300 --> 2:04:44.860
 You could just tell he's, uh, he's good at judo and that's kind of fascinating.

2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:48.180
 Um, it's, it's fascinating to see political leaders.

2:04:48.180 --> 2:04:53.900
 I've gotten to interact with quite a few for whom judo was a formative experience in

2:04:53.900 --> 2:04:55.180
 their life.

2:04:55.180 --> 2:04:59.180
 And that's so interesting that for a lot of people, judo was played a big part in our

2:04:59.180 --> 2:05:00.780
 life early development.

2:05:00.780 --> 2:05:05.620
 It's similar to like, um, if you served in the military, there's just something about

2:05:05.620 --> 2:05:06.620
 judo.

2:05:06.620 --> 2:05:09.660
 It's the, um, as a martial art, it's not just the technique.

2:05:09.660 --> 2:05:16.020
 So yes, there's something about gaining confidence through becoming aware of what like your body

2:05:16.020 --> 2:05:20.740
 can do the sort of, uh, the artistry and the skill of it.

2:05:20.740 --> 2:05:25.420
 Also the power being able to dominate another human being with technique, but also like

2:05:25.420 --> 2:05:32.860
 the, um, I don't know, the formality, the discipline of just, uh, honoring the tradition

2:05:32.860 --> 2:05:33.860
 of it.

2:05:33.860 --> 2:05:37.980
 So all of that mixed together somehow creates memories.

2:05:37.980 --> 2:05:42.660
 It creates memories that kind of define you as a human being and that you carry that forward

2:05:42.660 --> 2:05:43.660
 throughout your life.

2:05:43.660 --> 2:05:50.500
 And I've just been surprised to know how many powerful people internationally have, uh,

2:05:50.500 --> 2:05:55.180
 like in their heart and their, who they are, judo, for the core of it.

2:05:55.180 --> 2:05:57.740
 It makes you the human being that you are.

2:05:57.740 --> 2:05:58.740
 It really does.

2:05:58.740 --> 2:06:02.820
 Like it, it becomes a fabric of, of, if people, the people that stick with it, right, to stay

2:06:02.820 --> 2:06:03.820
 with it.

2:06:03.820 --> 2:06:07.680
 And it, because it, I mean, it teaches you so many lessons.

2:06:07.680 --> 2:06:13.180
 It's so memorable because of what you talked about the tradition, um, but it's also you

2:06:13.180 --> 2:06:18.160
 grow with other people, you know, and you learn from other people and you experience things

2:06:18.160 --> 2:06:19.160
 with other people.

2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:26.100
 It's such a hands on sport that, um, it's very memorable and people love it so much.

2:06:26.100 --> 2:06:31.540
 Like right now at my dojo, we have like four generations, like somebody that did judo with

2:06:31.540 --> 2:06:38.140
 my dad, you know, had a kid who, who trained with me, who loved, you know, judo so much,

2:06:38.140 --> 2:06:45.020
 had a kid that kid was, you know, now in his twenties who did judo and now has a kid who's

2:06:45.020 --> 2:06:48.300
 two or three or four that's coming to my toddler program at my school.

2:06:48.300 --> 2:06:52.820
 Like we're talking four generations and they all loved the experience so much and what

2:06:52.820 --> 2:06:57.340
 it did for them and their lives that they wanted the next generation to also experience

2:06:57.340 --> 2:06:58.540
 the same thing.

2:06:58.540 --> 2:07:04.220
 This is a tricky question, but if, if people are interested in judo and want to start learning

2:07:04.220 --> 2:07:09.940
 it in the United States, there's, uh, thousands of jiu jitsu schools, for example, is there

2:07:09.940 --> 2:07:19.700
 advice you can give to people interested in judo or maybe to jiu jitsu, uh, uh, gym owners

2:07:19.700 --> 2:07:24.780
 like how, how, how do you get judo as part of your life in America?

2:07:24.780 --> 2:07:28.380
 Well, I mean, if you're fortunate to live near another dojo, right?

2:07:28.380 --> 2:07:33.420
 And a place that has judo locally, then that's your best opportunity to learn is to go learn

2:07:33.420 --> 2:07:35.220
 from, uh, another school.

2:07:35.220 --> 2:07:41.500
 Um, un, unfortunately, sometimes the nearest dojo might not be for two hours or three hours

2:07:41.500 --> 2:07:44.540
 away from where you're at, which is an obstacle.

2:07:44.540 --> 2:07:45.540
 You're not going to do that.

2:07:45.540 --> 2:07:53.020
 So, I mean, Travis and I did start the American judo system online, um, it's at USA judo.com

2:07:53.020 --> 2:08:00.500
 and we've broken down every single judo technique to the very, very basic elements of just movement.

2:08:00.500 --> 2:08:05.860
 So we teach every technique of how you do it mechanically with just your feet, then

2:08:05.860 --> 2:08:11.260
 how you incorporate your hands and your feet together, um, how you do it in all directions,

2:08:11.260 --> 2:08:16.380
 moving forward, sideways, backwards, how to then introduce a partner into the, into the

2:08:16.380 --> 2:08:23.580
 movement, um, how to do basic, uh, Uchikomi or repetitions with a partner, then moving

2:08:23.580 --> 2:08:27.300
 with a partner, then how to throw your opponent static, how to throw your opponent.

2:08:27.300 --> 2:08:32.100
 So basically from the very foundation of the movement all the way to the most advanced

2:08:32.100 --> 2:08:37.340
 level, we've documented this, uh, through separate videos.

2:08:37.340 --> 2:08:42.940
 And we've taken now, I think 12 to 15 of standing techniques combined with a whole bunch of

2:08:42.940 --> 2:08:44.660
 groundwork techniques.

2:08:44.660 --> 2:08:49.540
 And our goal is just to continue to build this platform out so that anybody anywhere

2:08:49.540 --> 2:08:52.500
 can learn online and can ask questions.

2:08:52.500 --> 2:08:56.500
 We have a live training class every couple of weeks, every two weeks, he or I answer

2:08:56.500 --> 2:09:00.540
 questions online, um, for our, our members.

2:09:00.540 --> 2:09:06.500
 Um, ideally what we'd like to do is have a, a standing curriculum for Jiu Jitsu instructors

2:09:06.500 --> 2:09:10.140
 that want to learn, um, and become black belts in Judo.

2:09:10.140 --> 2:09:12.140
 Here's how these are the techniques you need to know.

2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:14.060
 This is how many reps you need to do.

2:09:14.060 --> 2:09:18.980
 This is how efficient you need to get at that, at those techniques to become, um, certified

2:09:18.980 --> 2:09:23.900
 as an instructor or become a black belt, um, and eventually have an online promotion system

2:09:23.900 --> 2:09:30.220
 where anybody anywhere can just submit videos and, um, show us that they can do those techniques.

2:09:30.220 --> 2:09:34.540
 And obviously we'll have people review them and this is a dream and a vision, but we've

2:09:34.540 --> 2:09:36.500
 already started the platform.

2:09:36.500 --> 2:09:41.180
 We're about to do a collaborative effort with USA Judo where all of their members will start

2:09:41.180 --> 2:09:43.420
 to get access to this platform as well.

2:09:43.420 --> 2:09:48.380
 And if we can get that, uh, influx of, of money and people on the platform, it'll allow

2:09:48.380 --> 2:09:51.940
 us to, to hire and grow it faster.

2:09:51.940 --> 2:09:55.700
 So you also want to do like certification there.

2:09:55.700 --> 2:09:57.420
 It's not just instruction.

2:09:57.420 --> 2:09:58.420
 Correct.

2:09:58.420 --> 2:09:59.900
 That would be amazing.

2:09:59.900 --> 2:10:00.900
 Yeah.

2:10:00.900 --> 2:10:05.300
 Um, let me, for me personally, sort of, I mean, mostly in Austin, Texas now.

2:10:05.300 --> 2:10:09.860
 And there's a few Judo schools, but it's not, not really.

2:10:09.860 --> 2:10:10.860
 Right.

2:10:10.860 --> 2:10:14.580
 There's not, uh, and it's just one of those cities that doesn't quite have, I mean, there's

2:10:14.580 --> 2:10:20.180
 a few, it's basically just like a few random Judo people that kind of kind of gather together

2:10:20.180 --> 2:10:28.460
 a couple of times a week, but it's not a system, a dojo, uh, uh, an instructor or integrated

2:10:28.460 --> 2:10:30.700
 into a Jiu Jitsu school or not.

2:10:30.700 --> 2:10:37.380
 The problem with most Judo dojos right now is that most of them cater towards the competitive

2:10:37.380 --> 2:10:38.380
 side.

2:10:38.380 --> 2:10:43.380
 Um, also a lot of them do it recreationally, meaning this isn't how they make a living.

2:10:43.380 --> 2:10:46.940
 So they're there three nights a week or they're there five, even if they're there five nights

2:10:46.940 --> 2:10:51.020
 a week, it's still only one junior class and one senior class.

2:10:51.020 --> 2:10:52.020
 And that's it.

2:10:52.020 --> 2:10:54.700
 And it's one size fits all the, doesn't matter what level you're at.

2:10:54.700 --> 2:10:55.700
 It's one size fits all.

2:10:55.700 --> 2:10:59.700
 So you can't get out of the training, what you're looking to get out of the training.

2:10:59.700 --> 2:11:04.700
 It's whatever the instructor's teaching, you know, um, and you can't learn because it's

2:11:04.700 --> 2:11:06.420
 not at the appropriate level for you.

2:11:06.420 --> 2:11:10.100
 And usually you're pushed into doing randori where you have no choice but to do the randori

2:11:10.100 --> 2:11:11.620
 part of the training.

2:11:11.620 --> 2:11:14.820
 Um, so it's, it's a challenge to go learn.

2:11:14.820 --> 2:11:19.340
 And then a lot of times the, the, the schools are old school, so they go make you do falls

2:11:19.340 --> 2:11:20.340
 for a half hour.

2:11:20.340 --> 2:11:23.740
 They make you do thing, you know, make you do things, maybe you're a jujitsu person who

2:11:23.740 --> 2:11:27.340
 knows how to fall already, but you haven't proven it to the Judo instructor and they

2:11:27.340 --> 2:11:28.340
 don't break the norm.

2:11:28.340 --> 2:11:32.620
 And so you still have to fall for six months, which turns a lot of people away as well.

2:11:32.620 --> 2:11:36.220
 So it's, you know, it's like any business.

2:11:36.220 --> 2:11:42.980
 If you don't deliver on your customer's expectations, you're not going to have very many customers,

2:11:42.980 --> 2:11:44.620
 which is the way it is now.

2:11:44.620 --> 2:11:49.900
 So a lot of people who listen to this, but in general in the United States, practice

2:11:49.900 --> 2:11:57.540
 Brazilian jujitsu, which has a lot of similarities to Judo has obviously its origins in Judo.

2:11:57.540 --> 2:12:02.100
 How would you compare the two arts from the perspective of people just interested about

2:12:02.100 --> 2:12:04.180
 both arts?

2:12:04.180 --> 2:12:08.620
 Do you recommend people who do jujitsu get into Judo?

2:12:08.620 --> 2:12:10.660
 How can you enrich their jujitsu?

2:12:10.660 --> 2:12:14.660
 How do you compare the two arts, the actual practice of it and why it might be useful

2:12:14.660 --> 2:12:15.660
 to you?

2:12:15.660 --> 2:12:19.740
 I mean, I think that Judo is a hard sport for adults to do.

2:12:19.740 --> 2:12:20.740
 It just is.

2:12:20.740 --> 2:12:24.620
 You know, especially people that haven't fallen in a long time, haven't, you know, aren't

2:12:24.620 --> 2:12:30.100
 very athletic, you know, haven't, I think, I think about my own experience, right?

2:12:30.100 --> 2:12:33.540
 Other than Judo, when did I ever do like a forward summer salt?

2:12:33.540 --> 2:12:34.540
 Right.

2:12:34.540 --> 2:12:35.540
 Maybe when I was in grade school, right?

2:12:35.540 --> 2:12:39.380
 That's the last time I've left my feet was in grade school.

2:12:39.380 --> 2:12:42.820
 Most people haven't got off of a chair or a couch.

2:12:42.820 --> 2:12:46.860
 They spend eight to 10 hours a day either working behind a computer or sitting on a

2:12:46.860 --> 2:12:48.540
 couch watching TV, right?

2:12:48.540 --> 2:12:53.340
 And they're not that athletic and they haven't done anything athletic, at least probably

2:12:53.340 --> 2:12:54.340
 since high school.

2:12:54.340 --> 2:12:55.340
 Yeah.

2:12:55.340 --> 2:12:56.340
 Right?

2:12:56.340 --> 2:12:57.340
 That's their last athletic endeavor, most of them.

2:12:57.340 --> 2:13:02.180
 So you're talking about as an adult that's 35 or 40 wanting to start a sport, Judo is

2:13:02.180 --> 2:13:08.020
 a really hard sport to start, especially in today's dojos that don't have a recreational

2:13:08.020 --> 2:13:11.740
 adult program, you know, when it's one size fits all its heart.

2:13:11.740 --> 2:13:15.860
 So for those people, Jiu Jitsu makes a heck of a lot of sense.

2:13:15.860 --> 2:13:21.380
 Good self defense, it's cerebral, where you got to use your brain, you're a smaller person,

2:13:21.380 --> 2:13:25.900
 you have to use technique, you know, it teaches all the same things as Judo, but it's a safe

2:13:25.900 --> 2:13:27.300
 way to do it.

2:13:27.300 --> 2:13:34.020
 And because of the validation it has with the UFC and MMA today, right, everybody knows

2:13:34.020 --> 2:13:38.900
 Jiu Jitsu, so now they can be part of mainstream society and talk intelligently about what

2:13:38.900 --> 2:13:42.220
 they see on television or what's going on on ESPN today, right?

2:13:42.220 --> 2:13:43.220
 They have some knowledge.

2:13:43.220 --> 2:13:48.940
 So they have an identity and also there's a good culture in Jiu Jitsu where it's becoming

2:13:48.940 --> 2:13:53.180
 a family, you know, the dojo is the family place, you go to feel good, you go to see

2:13:53.180 --> 2:13:57.300
 your friends, you go to get fit and you have a good time, right?

2:13:57.300 --> 2:14:00.100
 So it makes a lot of sense why it's growing.

2:14:00.100 --> 2:14:04.620
 Judo, on the other hand, I think is a better sport for children to do.

2:14:04.620 --> 2:14:10.180
 It's more, I would say, fun and interactive, it's a little easier to teach the kids how

2:14:10.180 --> 2:14:15.620
 to do the throwing skills and for safety and things like that, their body can handle more

2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:20.580
 than the adults can, they're less likely to get injured, you know, they can, it makes

2:14:20.580 --> 2:14:25.940
 them better athletes because it's a lot more three dimensional in my opinion, you know.

2:14:25.940 --> 2:14:32.300
 So I think there's a good fit between Judo can thrive from kids till, you know, whatever,

2:14:32.300 --> 2:14:37.900
 high school, college, Jiu Jitsu thrives from that 18 year old up, right?

2:14:37.900 --> 2:14:40.580
 Right now, that's kind of where it is.

2:14:40.580 --> 2:14:46.420
 So as a dojo, you have to kind of focus on the teens and the college, like early 20s,

2:14:46.420 --> 2:14:47.420
 that kind of...

2:14:47.420 --> 2:14:51.540
 Or you need to have, if you're going to be a successful Judo dojo, you have to have

2:14:51.540 --> 2:14:58.500
 that recreational fundamental adult program in your school where people actually come

2:14:58.500 --> 2:15:04.500
 to Judo, learn the moves, but aren't pushed into randori training and pushed into things

2:15:04.500 --> 2:15:08.500
 where they're uncomfortable and they can't control the situation because there's too

2:15:08.500 --> 2:15:11.700
 many unknowns.

2:15:11.700 --> 2:15:17.660
 You got an education of Browns, you're somebody was amazing because as an Olympian and an

2:15:17.660 --> 2:15:23.980
 Olympic coach, you've always emphasized kind of balance and educational, all of that side

2:15:23.980 --> 2:15:24.980
 of life.

2:15:24.980 --> 2:15:26.340
 So developing your brain too.

2:15:26.340 --> 2:15:33.260
 So you are an Olympic medalist, a coach of Olympic medalists, your business owners,

2:15:33.260 --> 2:15:35.860
 so successful in all these domains.

2:15:35.860 --> 2:15:42.820
 So I have to ask, what advice would you give to young people today, high school, Judo age,

2:15:42.820 --> 2:15:50.100
 high school, college, undergrad, how to be successful in their career or just in life

2:15:50.100 --> 2:15:54.420
 in general, how to live a life they can be proud of?

2:15:54.420 --> 2:16:00.020
 I think you have to be true to yourself, you have to decide what it is you really want

2:16:00.020 --> 2:16:05.020
 to do with your life and it's hard because when I grew up, I didn't know I was going

2:16:05.020 --> 2:16:06.020
 to be successful.

2:16:06.020 --> 2:16:09.020
 When I was young, I didn't know I was going to be an Olympic medalist.

2:16:09.020 --> 2:16:14.780
 I certainly did envision myself owning a couple of companies that makes their living exclusively

2:16:14.780 --> 2:16:18.660
 for martial arts or Judo because that wasn't really an opportunity when I was a kid, but

2:16:18.660 --> 2:16:20.580
 I've created that opportunity.

2:16:20.580 --> 2:16:24.580
 I would just say that pick something that you're passionate about.

2:16:24.580 --> 2:16:28.820
 I was stuck in a career before where I wasn't passionate about it and it was my wife who

2:16:28.820 --> 2:16:36.820
 said, Jimmy, if you can figure out how to make your living exclusively for martial arts,

2:16:36.820 --> 2:16:40.700
 whether your brain and your heart and your passion is all towards one thing that you

2:16:40.700 --> 2:16:43.420
 really like, then you'll be successful.

2:16:43.420 --> 2:16:44.420
 I left the job.

2:16:44.420 --> 2:16:45.420
 I had three kids.

2:16:45.420 --> 2:16:47.940
 I was working for monster.com.

2:16:47.940 --> 2:16:51.940
 I was an internet marketing and I was working for that company, great company, nothing wrong

2:16:51.940 --> 2:16:57.180
 with the company, but sitting behind the desk from eight till five and then I get to go

2:16:57.180 --> 2:17:02.620
 to Judo from six till nine at night, my whole day is tied up doing something that I'm really

2:17:02.620 --> 2:17:04.140
 not passionate about.

2:17:04.140 --> 2:17:09.100
 She said, if you can figure out how to make money from your dojo and other things Judo

2:17:09.100 --> 2:17:11.940
 related, then I think you'll be successful.

2:17:11.940 --> 2:17:15.580
 She's the one that my wife, Marie, gave me that advice and I would give that to others.

2:17:15.580 --> 2:17:19.220
 Find something that you love doing where it doesn't feel like work, something you're

2:17:19.220 --> 2:17:20.220
 passionate about.

2:17:20.220 --> 2:17:25.300
 If the opportunity doesn't exist, how to make money on it, you can create the opportunity.

2:17:25.300 --> 2:17:26.300
 Be resourceful.

2:17:26.300 --> 2:17:27.300
 Figure it out.

2:17:27.300 --> 2:17:29.940
 Don't let anybody tell you can't do it.

2:17:29.940 --> 2:17:34.700
 I didn't know that I could have a 200 person Judo school that only taught Judo because

2:17:34.700 --> 2:17:37.820
 that really didn't exist in this country.

2:17:37.820 --> 2:17:40.420
 It actually charges money like Jujitsu charges.

2:17:40.420 --> 2:17:43.740
 We're talking not, there's plenty of clubs out there that charge 10 bucks a month that

2:17:43.740 --> 2:17:49.060
 might have 100 people, but there's not many that with the tuition is $150 a month having

2:17:49.060 --> 2:17:50.820
 200 people.

2:17:50.820 --> 2:17:56.340
 That's a successful business, but it wasn't done before, but be passionate about it, understand

2:17:56.340 --> 2:18:00.020
 you're going to fail, understand you're going to get knocked down, beat up.

2:18:00.020 --> 2:18:03.620
 There's going to be dark days, but you got to persevere.

2:18:03.620 --> 2:18:04.940
 You got to believe in yourself.

2:18:04.940 --> 2:18:06.680
 You got to have a plan.

2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:10.100
 You have to be willing to learn from other people.

2:18:10.100 --> 2:18:11.100
 That's what I did.

2:18:11.100 --> 2:18:15.140
 If I didn't know it, I brought somebody in to tell me, what am I doing wrong?

2:18:15.140 --> 2:18:16.140
 Look from the outside.

2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:17.140
 What do you see?

2:18:17.140 --> 2:18:18.140
 Okay, great.

2:18:18.140 --> 2:18:19.140
 Then you got to be willing to change.

2:18:19.140 --> 2:18:22.700
 You got to be willing to adapt.

2:18:22.700 --> 2:18:27.900
 I think listening, believing in myself and creating opportunity.

2:18:27.900 --> 2:18:30.940
 The other thing is helping others.

2:18:30.940 --> 2:18:37.060
 Something I always did in my judo life and in my business life.

2:18:37.060 --> 2:18:41.340
 If somebody came to me and asked for help with, hey man, is there something you can do to

2:18:41.340 --> 2:18:42.340
 help me?

2:18:42.340 --> 2:18:43.340
 I'm trying to get this thing started.

2:18:43.340 --> 2:18:50.500
 I'm trying to get this dojo off the ground or I'm trying to run this event series.

2:18:50.500 --> 2:18:54.500
 I was creative in trying to figure out a way to help them make it work because if that

2:18:54.500 --> 2:18:59.260
 really was their dream and I could help them do their dream, I felt like that person would

2:18:59.260 --> 2:19:05.100
 then give nothing but good, good comments about us, good, good.

2:19:05.100 --> 2:19:06.580
 They remember it forever.

2:19:06.580 --> 2:19:12.260
 They become like family and they're the best advocates for your business ever.

2:19:12.260 --> 2:19:14.900
 The kids that I taught at my dojo were treated that way.

2:19:14.900 --> 2:19:17.140
 The people that worked for me get treated that way.

2:19:17.140 --> 2:19:23.740
 The people that my customers that I work with in building their dojos get treated that way.

2:19:23.740 --> 2:19:27.780
 People that ran tournaments, whether it was Grappler's Quest years ago and helping that

2:19:27.780 --> 2:19:36.180
 guy with a full set of mats for his, Brian Simmons, with his thing or any of the graces.

2:19:36.180 --> 2:19:39.820
 It just became like family and then I just work hard and deliver on what I say I'm going

2:19:39.820 --> 2:19:40.820
 to do.

2:19:40.820 --> 2:19:43.180
 If I say I'm going to do it, I do it.

2:19:43.180 --> 2:19:44.860
 I think it goes a long way.

2:19:44.860 --> 2:19:48.380
 And I got a comment in a small way.

2:19:48.380 --> 2:19:49.380
 People may not know.

2:19:49.380 --> 2:19:50.900
 I think it's still on YouTube.

2:19:50.900 --> 2:19:57.660
 We previously talked many years ago and I remember you were so kind to me and you didn't

2:19:57.660 --> 2:19:59.020
 really know who I was.

2:19:59.020 --> 2:20:01.220
 You just took me as a human being.

2:20:01.220 --> 2:20:05.420
 You welcomed me into your dojo and we just had a conversation on a podcast or whatever

2:20:05.420 --> 2:20:07.220
 the heck you call that thing.

2:20:07.220 --> 2:20:16.380
 And you were just very kind and you were also just, it was the last conversation I had when

2:20:16.380 --> 2:20:20.380
 I showed up to MIT and it stayed with me.

2:20:20.380 --> 2:20:27.220
 So I've resumed doing this podcast, but it stayed with me because you said that I did

2:20:27.220 --> 2:20:29.300
 a good job at this.

2:20:29.300 --> 2:20:36.100
 And people, especially at that time, didn't tell me that and just that little act of kindness

2:20:36.100 --> 2:20:38.140
 is probably just a regular part of your day.

2:20:38.140 --> 2:20:39.140
 You had a busy day.

2:20:39.140 --> 2:20:40.380
 It was the end of the day.

2:20:40.380 --> 2:20:46.700
 Just saying that, that was powerful and that pays off somehow.

2:20:46.700 --> 2:20:49.060
 So thank you for that.

2:20:49.060 --> 2:20:50.460
 But that was sincere.

2:20:50.460 --> 2:20:51.460
 It was genuine.

2:20:51.460 --> 2:20:54.380
 I felt like I had been to so many interviews.

2:20:54.380 --> 2:20:57.860
 When it's around the Olympic time, there's lots of beat reporters that come out and they're

2:20:57.860 --> 2:21:02.500
 trying to get your time and they're there because they have to get the story for their

2:21:02.500 --> 2:21:04.500
 newspaper or their television show.

2:21:04.500 --> 2:21:10.540
 And a lot of times those people show up and they pronounce my name wrong or they get something

2:21:10.540 --> 2:21:16.340
 wrong about the background or they offend me because they call me five minutes before

2:21:16.340 --> 2:21:19.260
 that they're supposed to be there and say, oh, sorry, we're running late, we'll be there

2:21:19.260 --> 2:21:20.260
 an hour and a half.

2:21:20.260 --> 2:21:21.940
 Well, I'm a busy guy too.

2:21:21.940 --> 2:21:27.700
 But you were somebody that showed up, was so prepared with your notes, knew everything

2:21:27.700 --> 2:21:34.420
 about the history of what I had done, the questions you asked were intelligent questions

2:21:34.420 --> 2:21:35.780
 they were well thought out.

2:21:35.780 --> 2:21:41.060
 And at the end of that interview, I was really genuinely impressed.

2:21:41.060 --> 2:21:45.340
 And I wanted to let you know you did a great job because you stood out from the rest.

2:21:45.340 --> 2:21:46.340
 Thank you.

2:21:46.340 --> 2:21:47.340
 Yeah.

2:21:47.340 --> 2:21:49.380
 I mean, for me, it was like showing up to like the Mecca, like the track.

2:21:49.380 --> 2:21:54.820
 I mean, you know, you don't always want to just tell that to people, but you show up,

2:21:54.820 --> 2:21:58.700
 you know, obviously you're the legend of judo in the United States.

2:21:58.700 --> 2:22:01.980
 And so that was like Boston is the Mecca.

2:22:01.980 --> 2:22:02.980
 Right.

2:22:02.980 --> 2:22:06.660
 I think that's where you travel to talk to the great.

2:22:06.660 --> 2:22:11.020
 So the fact that you were kind to me just stuck with me for a long time.

2:22:11.020 --> 2:22:21.780
 So it pays off to be kind to others, to give them a chance, Jimmy, thank you so much for

2:22:21.780 --> 2:22:24.620
 giving me another chance and spending your valuable time.

2:22:24.620 --> 2:22:30.100
 And you've also were kind enough to invite me to train with you today at your dojo.

2:22:30.100 --> 2:22:31.420
 So I can't wait.

2:22:31.420 --> 2:22:32.420
 Let's go.

2:22:32.420 --> 2:22:33.420
 Let's do some judo.

2:22:33.420 --> 2:22:34.420
 Yeah.

2:22:34.420 --> 2:22:35.420
 Awesome.

2:22:35.420 --> 2:22:36.420
 Thank you.

2:22:36.420 --> 2:22:40.140
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jimmy Pedro to support this podcast.

2:22:40.140 --> 2:22:43.060
 Please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:22:43.060 --> 2:22:46.140
 And now let me leave you with some words from Bruce Lee.

2:22:46.140 --> 2:22:52.900
 I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced

2:22:52.900 --> 2:22:56.460
 one kick 10,000 times.

2:22:56.460 --> 2:23:02.620
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
