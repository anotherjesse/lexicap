00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
 The following is a conversation with Matthew Johnson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral

00:05.000 --> 00:10.760
 science at Johns Hopkins, and is one of the top scientists in the world conducting seminal

00:10.760 --> 00:13.520
 research on psychedelics.

00:13.520 --> 00:19.880
 This was one of the most eye opening and fascinating conversations I've ever had on this podcast.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.720
 I'm sure I'll talk with Matt many more times.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.840
 Quick mention of a sponsor followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:26.840 --> 00:32.880
 Thank you to a new sponsor, Brave, a fast browser that feels like Chrome but has more

 privacy preserving features.

00:34.880 --> 00:40.640
 Neuro, the maker of functional sugar free gum and mints that I use to give my brain

00:40.640 --> 00:42.760
 a quick caffeine boost.

00:42.760 --> 00:48.720
 Forcigmatic, the maker of delicious mushroom coffee, I'm just now realizing how ironic

00:48.720 --> 00:54.840
 the set of sponsors are, and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.

00:54.840 --> 01:00.320
 Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.920
 As a side note, let me say that psychedelics is an area of study that is fascinating to

01:04.920 --> 01:10.360
 me, in that it gives hints that much of the magic of our experience arises from just a

01:10.360 --> 01:14.920
 few chemical interactions in the brain, and that the nature of that experience can be

01:14.920 --> 01:23.440
 expanded through the tools of biology, chemistry, physics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

01:23.440 --> 01:28.360
 The fact that a world class scientist and researcher like Matt can apply rigor to our

01:28.360 --> 01:34.360
 study of this mysterious and fascinating topic is exciting to me beyond words.

01:34.360 --> 01:39.280
 As is the case with any of my colleagues who dare to venture out into the darkness of all

01:39.280 --> 01:44.920
 that is unknown about the human mind, with both an openness of first principle thinking

01:44.920 --> 01:47.320
 and the rigor of the scientific method.

01:58.160 --> 02:03.080
 And now, here's my conversation with Matthew Johnson.

02:03.080 --> 02:09.040
 Can you give an introduction to psychedelics, like a whirlwind overview?

02:09.040 --> 02:15.600
 Maybe what are psychedelics and what are the kinds of psychedelics out there and in whatever

02:15.600 --> 02:17.600
 way you find meaningful to categorize.

02:17.600 --> 02:23.320
 Yeah, you can categorize them by their chemical structure.

02:23.320 --> 02:33.520
 So phenethylamines, tryptamines, ergalines, that is less of a meaningful way to classify

02:33.520 --> 02:34.520
 them.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.960
 I think that their pharmacological activity, their receptor activity is the best way.

02:38.960 --> 02:43.040
 Well, let me start even broader than that because there I'm talking about the classic

02:43.040 --> 02:44.040
 psychedelics.

02:44.040 --> 02:51.160
 Broadly speaking, when we say psychedelic, that refers to, for most people, a broad number

02:51.160 --> 02:55.120
 of compounds that work in different pharmacological ways.

02:55.120 --> 02:59.320
 So it includes the so called classic psychedelics.

02:59.320 --> 03:07.480
 That includes psilocybin and solosin, which are in mushrooms, LSD, dimethyl tryptamine

03:07.480 --> 03:14.520
 or DMT, it's an ayahuasca, people can smoke it too, mescaline, which is in peyote and

03:14.520 --> 03:17.960
 sanpatero cactus.

03:17.960 --> 03:24.600
 And those all work by hitting a certain subtype of serotonin receptor, the serotonin 2A receptor.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.760
 They act as agonists at that receptor.

03:28.760 --> 03:39.480
 Other compounds like PCP, ketamine, MDMA, ibogaine, they all are more broadly speaking called

03:39.480 --> 03:45.880
 psychedelics, but they work by very different ways pharmacologically.

03:45.880 --> 03:51.080
 And they have some different effects, including subjective effects, even though there's enough

03:51.080 --> 03:59.200
 of an overlap in the subjective effects that people informally refer to them as psychedelic.

03:59.200 --> 04:07.640
 And I think what that overlap is, compared to say caffeine and cocaine and Ambien, etc.,

04:07.640 --> 04:14.400
 other psychoactive drugs, is that they have strong effects in altering one's sense of

04:14.400 --> 04:18.120
 reality and including the sense of self.

04:18.120 --> 04:22.680
 And I should throw in there that cannabis, more historically like in the 70s, has been

04:22.680 --> 04:24.080
 called a minor psychedelic.

04:24.080 --> 04:28.480
 And I think with that latter definition, it does fit that definition, particularly if

04:28.480 --> 04:30.560
 one doesn't have a tolerance.

04:30.560 --> 04:36.920
 So you mentioned serotonin, so most of the effect comes from something around the chemistry

04:36.920 --> 04:39.120
 around neurotransmitters and so on.

04:39.120 --> 04:44.760
 So it's chemical interactions in the brain, or is there other kinds of interactions that

04:44.760 --> 04:50.720
 have this kind of perception and self awareness altering effects?

04:50.720 --> 04:58.120
 Well, as far as we know, all of the psychedelics of all the different classes we've talked

04:58.120 --> 05:04.680
 about, their major activity is caused by receptor level events.

05:04.680 --> 05:11.600
 So either acting at the post receptor side of the synapse, in other words, neurotransmission

05:11.600 --> 05:19.320
 operates by one neuron releasing neurotransmitter into a synapse, a gap between the two neurons.

05:19.320 --> 05:25.080
 And then the other neuron receives, it has receptors that receives, and then there can

05:25.080 --> 05:28.600
 be an activation caused by that.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.280
 So it's like a pitcher and a catcher.

05:30.280 --> 05:38.840
 So all of the major psychedelics work by either mimicking a pitcher or a catcher.

05:38.840 --> 05:44.560
 So for example, the classic psychedelics, they fit into the same catcher's mitt on

05:44.560 --> 05:50.280
 the post synaptic receptor side as serotonin itself.

05:50.280 --> 05:56.480
 But they do a slightly different thing to the cell, to the neuron than serotonin does.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.680
 There's a different signaling pathway after that initial activation.

06:00.680 --> 06:07.920
 Something like MDMA works at the presynaptic side, the pitcher side, and basically it floods

06:07.920 --> 06:14.320
 the synapse or the gap between the cells with a bunch of serotonin, the natural neurotransmitter.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.760
 So it's like the pitcher in a baseball game all of a sudden just starts throwing balls

06:17.760 --> 06:20.720
 like every second.

06:20.720 --> 06:27.240
 Everything we're talking about is it often more natural, meaning found in the natural

06:27.240 --> 06:28.240
 world?

06:28.240 --> 06:35.640
 You mentioned cacti, cactus, or is it chemically manufactured artificially in the lab?

06:35.640 --> 06:38.760
 So the classic psychedelics, there's...

06:38.760 --> 06:41.120
 What are the classics?

06:41.120 --> 06:46.080
 Using terminology that's not chemical terminology, not like the terminology you see in titles

06:46.080 --> 06:50.760
 of papers, academic papers, but more common parlance.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.960
 It would be good to define their effects, like how they're different.

06:54.960 --> 07:00.800
 And so it includes LSD, psilocybin, which is in mushrooms, mescaline, DMT.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.300
 Which one is mescaline?

07:02.300 --> 07:07.760
 One is in the different cacti, so the one most people will know is peyote, but it also

07:07.760 --> 07:11.160
 shows up in San Pedro or Peruvian torch.

07:11.160 --> 07:19.680
 And all of these classic psychedelics, at the right dose, and typically, they have very

07:19.680 --> 07:24.680
 strong effects on one sense of reality and one sense of self.

07:24.680 --> 07:29.280
 What some of the things that make them different than other, more broadly speaking psychedelics

07:29.280 --> 07:36.360
 like MDMA and others, is that there, at least the major examples, there are some exotic

07:36.360 --> 07:41.040
 ones that differ, but the ones I've talked about are extremely safe at the physiological

07:41.040 --> 07:42.040
 level.

07:42.040 --> 07:46.320
 Like LSD and psilocybin, there's no known lethal overdose.

07:46.320 --> 07:52.200
 Unless you have really severe heart disease, because it modestly raises your blood pressure,

07:52.200 --> 07:57.160
 so the same person might be hurt, troubling snow or going up the stairs, that could have

07:57.160 --> 08:03.080
 a cardiac event, because they've taken one of these drugs.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.960
 But for most people, someone could take 1,000 times what the effect of dose is, and it's

08:06.960 --> 08:11.400
 not going to cause any organ damage, affect the brainstem, make them stop breathing.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.960
 So in that sense, they're freakishly safe at the physio...

08:15.960 --> 08:19.720
 I would never call any compounds safe, because there's always a risk.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.200
 They're freakishly safe at the physiological level.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.120
 I mean, you can hardly find anything over the counter like that.

08:25.120 --> 08:28.240
 I mean, aspirin's not like that, caffeine is not like that.

08:28.240 --> 08:35.640
 Most drugs, you take 5, 10, 20, maybe it takes 100, but you get to some times the effect

08:35.640 --> 08:38.720
 of dose, and it's going to kill you or cause some serious damage.

08:38.720 --> 08:43.920
 And so that's something that's a remark about most of these classic psychedelics.

08:43.920 --> 08:50.400
 That's incredible, by the way, that you can go on a hell of a journey in the mind, like

08:50.400 --> 08:58.080
 probably transformative, potentially in a deeply transformative way, and yet there's

08:58.080 --> 09:02.640
 no dose that in most people would have a lethal effect.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.640
 That's kind of fascinating.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.920
 There's this duality between the mind and the body.

09:06.920 --> 09:07.920
 It's like...

09:07.920 --> 09:14.680
 Okay, sorry if I bring him up way too much, but David Goggins is like, you know, the kind

09:14.680 --> 09:19.840
 of things you go on a long run, like the hell you might go through in your mind.

09:19.840 --> 09:24.040
 Your mind can take a lot, and you can go through a lot with the mind, and the body will just

09:24.040 --> 09:25.200
 be its own thing.

09:25.200 --> 09:31.160
 You can go through hell, but after a good night's sleep, be back to normal, and the body is always

09:31.160 --> 09:32.160
 there.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.880
 So bringing it back to Goggins, it's like you can do that without even destroying your

09:34.880 --> 09:35.880
 knee or whatever.

09:35.880 --> 09:36.880
 Right, yes.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.120
 Or coming close and riding that line.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.120
 That's true.

09:39.120 --> 09:43.200
 So the unfortunate thing about the running, which he uses running to test the mind, so

09:43.200 --> 09:50.200
 the aspect of running that is negative, in order to test the mind, you really have to

09:50.200 --> 09:53.080
 push the body, like take the body through a journey.

09:53.080 --> 09:57.440
 I wish there was another way of doing that in the physical exercise space.

09:57.440 --> 10:02.200
 I think there are exercises that are easier on the body than others, but running sure

10:02.200 --> 10:05.000
 is a hell of an effective way to do it.

10:05.000 --> 10:12.600
 And one of the ways that where it differs is that you're unlike exercise, you're essentially...

10:12.600 --> 10:17.280
 This exercise, to really get to those intense levels, you really need to be persistent about

10:17.280 --> 10:18.280
 it.

10:18.280 --> 10:22.760
 I mean, it'll be intense if you're really out of shape, just jogging for five minutes.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.520
 But to really get to those intense levels, you need to have the dedication.

10:25.520 --> 10:33.200
 And so some of the other ways of altering subjective effects or states of consciousness

10:33.200 --> 10:39.160
 take that type of dedication, psychedelics though, I mean, someone takes the right dose.

10:39.160 --> 10:44.560
 They're strapped into the roller coaster, and something interesting is going to happen.

10:44.560 --> 10:49.800
 And I really like what you said about that distinction between the mind or the contrast

10:49.800 --> 11:00.240
 between the mind effects and the body effects, because I think of this, I do research with

11:00.240 --> 11:07.160
 all the drugs, caffeine, alcohol, methamphetamine, cocaine, alcohol, legal, illegal.

11:07.160 --> 11:14.920
 Most of these drugs, thinking about, say, cocaine and methamphetamine, you can't give

11:14.920 --> 11:21.240
 to a regular user, you can't safely give a dose where the regular cocaine user is going

11:21.240 --> 11:29.760
 to say, oh man, that's the strongest coke I've ever had, because you get it past the

11:29.760 --> 11:33.680
 ethics committee and you need approval, and I wouldn't want to give someone something

11:33.680 --> 11:34.680
 that's dangerous.

11:34.680 --> 11:38.440
 To go to those levels where they would say that, you would have to give something that's

11:38.440 --> 11:43.480
 physiologically riskier.

11:43.480 --> 11:50.240
 psilocybin or LSD, you can give a dose at the physiological level that is a very good

11:50.240 --> 11:55.240
 chance it's going to be the most intense psychological experience of that person's life and have

11:55.240 --> 11:59.240
 zero chance for most people if you screen them of killing them.

11:59.240 --> 12:03.560
 The big risk is behavioral toxicity, which is a fancy way of saying doing something stupid.

12:03.560 --> 12:07.520
 I mean, you're really intoxicated, like if you wander into traffic or you fall from

12:07.520 --> 12:12.200
 a height, just like plenty of people do on high doses of alcohol, and the other kind

12:12.200 --> 12:19.240
 of unique thing about classic psychedelics is that they're not addictive, which is pretty

12:19.240 --> 12:25.160
 much unheard of when it comes to so called drugs of abuse or drugs that people, at least

12:25.160 --> 12:34.240
 at some frequency, choose to take most of what we think of as drugs, caffeine, alcohol,

12:34.240 --> 12:36.760
 cocaine, cannabis.

12:36.760 --> 12:42.240
 Most of these you can get into alcohol, you can get into a daily use pattern, and that's

12:42.240 --> 12:46.840
 just so unheard of with psychedelics.

12:46.840 --> 12:52.000
 Most people have taken these things on a daily basis, it's more like they're building up

12:52.000 --> 12:55.640
 the courage to do it, and then they build up a tolerance, they're in college and they

12:55.640 --> 13:00.280
 do it on a day, or can you take acid seven days in a row, and that type of thing, rather

13:00.280 --> 13:04.440
 than a self control issue, where you have and say, oh God, I got to stop taking this,

13:04.440 --> 13:08.920
 I got to stop drinking every night, I got to cut down on the coke, whatever.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.600
 So that's the classic psychedelics.

13:11.600 --> 13:17.080
 What are the, what's the good term, modern psychedelics, or more maybe psychedelics that

13:17.080 --> 13:18.800
 are created in the lab?

13:18.800 --> 13:19.800
 What else is there?

13:19.800 --> 13:24.040
 Right, so MDMA is the big one, and I should say that with the classic psychedelics that

13:24.040 --> 13:30.920
 LSD is sort of, you can call it a semi synthetic, because there's natural from both ergot and

13:30.920 --> 13:39.400
 in certain seeds, morning glory seeds as one example, there are some very close chemical

13:39.400 --> 13:44.960
 relatives of LSD, so LSD is close to what occurs in nature, but not quite it.

13:44.960 --> 13:50.360
 But then when we get into the other non classic psychedelics, probably the most prominent

13:50.360 --> 13:58.240
 one is MDMA, people call it ecstasy, people call it molly, and it is, it differs from

13:58.240 --> 14:02.160
 classic psychedelics in a number of ways.

14:02.160 --> 14:08.680
 It can be addictive, but not so, it's like, you can have cocaine on this end of the continuum

14:08.680 --> 14:10.960
 and classic psychedelics here.

14:10.960 --> 14:11.960
 Continuum of addiction.

14:11.960 --> 14:17.920
 So it's certainly no cocaine, it's pretty rare for people to get into daily use patterns,

14:17.920 --> 14:23.280
 but it's possible, and they can get into more like, using once a week pattern, where they

14:23.280 --> 14:30.840
 can find it hard to stop, but it's somewhere in between mostly towards the classic psychedelic

14:30.840 --> 14:36.840
 side in terms of relatively little addiction potential.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.520
 But it's also more physiologically dangerous.

14:39.520 --> 14:45.920
 I think that the, certainly the therapeutic use, it's showing really promising effects

14:45.920 --> 14:50.720
 for treating PTSD and the models that are used, I think those are extremely acceptable

14:50.720 --> 14:56.040
 when it comes to the risk benefit ratio that you see all throughout medicine.

14:56.040 --> 15:01.640
 But nonetheless, we do know that at a certain dose and a certain frequency that MDMA can

15:01.640 --> 15:08.040
 cause long term damage to the serotonin system in the brain, so it doesn't have that level

15:08.040 --> 15:14.280
 of kind of freakish bodily safety that the classic psychedelics do.

15:14.280 --> 15:19.040
 And it has more of a heart load, a cardiovascular, I don't mean kind of emotion, I mean, in

15:19.040 --> 15:23.600
 this sense, although it is very emotional and that's something unique about its subjective

15:23.600 --> 15:25.920
 effects, but it's more of a presser.

15:25.920 --> 15:31.600
 And the terminology used instead of like a freakish capacity, allowing you from a researcher

15:31.600 --> 15:37.320
 perspective, but a personal perspective too of taking a journey with some of these psychedelics

15:37.320 --> 15:41.000
 that is the heroic dose as they say.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.040
 So like these are tools that allow you to take a serious mental journey, whatever that

15:45.040 --> 15:46.040
 is.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.040
 That's what you mean.

15:47.040 --> 15:51.600
 And with MDMA, there's a little bit, it starts entering this territory where you got to be

15:51.600 --> 15:55.160
 careful about the risks to the body potentially.

15:55.160 --> 16:01.600
 So yes, that in the sense that you can't kind of push the dose up as high as you safely

16:01.600 --> 16:06.160
 as one can, if they're in the right setting, like in our research, as they can with the

16:06.160 --> 16:11.400
 classic psychedelics, but probably more importantly, just the nature of the effects with MDMA aren't

16:11.400 --> 16:14.720
 the full on psychedelic.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.640
 It's not the full journey.

16:16.640 --> 16:23.360
 So it's sort of a psychedelic with rose colored glasses on, a psychedelic that's been called

16:23.360 --> 16:25.500
 more of a heart trip than a head trip.

16:25.500 --> 16:31.640
 The nature of reality doesn't unravel as frequently as it does with classic psychedelics.

16:31.640 --> 16:35.400
 But you're able to more directly sense your environment.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.080
 So your perception system still works.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.600
 It's not completely detached from reality with MDMA.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.000
 That's true, relatively speaking.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.880
 That said, at most doses of classic psychedelics, you still have a tether to reality.

16:48.880 --> 16:54.360
 Changes a little bit when you're talking about smoking DMT or smoking five methoxy DMT,

16:54.360 --> 16:57.640
 which are some interesting examples we could talk more about.

16:57.640 --> 17:07.920
 But with MDMA, for example, it's very rare to have what's called an ego loss experience

17:07.920 --> 17:16.640
 or a sense of transcendental unity, where one really seemingly loses the psychological

17:16.640 --> 17:19.240
 construct of the self.

17:19.240 --> 17:25.800
 But MDMA, it's very common for people to have this, they still are perceiving themselves

17:25.800 --> 17:32.400
 as a self, but it's common for them to have this warmth, this empathy for humanity and

17:32.400 --> 17:34.200
 for their friends and loved ones.

17:34.200 --> 17:39.720
 So it's more, and you see those effects under the classic psychedelics, but that's a subset

17:39.720 --> 17:41.560
 of what the classic psychedelics do.

17:41.560 --> 17:47.840
 So I see MDMA in terms of its subjective effects is if you think about Venn diagrams, it's sort

17:47.840 --> 17:50.560
 of MDMA is all within the classic psychedelics.

17:50.560 --> 17:56.400
 So everything that you see on a particular MDMA session, sometimes a psilocybin session

17:56.400 --> 17:58.280
 looks just like that.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.680
 But then sometimes it's completely different with psilocybin, it's a little more narrowed

18:02.680 --> 18:05.240
 in terms of the variability with MDMA.

18:05.240 --> 18:11.680
 Is there something general to say about what the psychedelics do to the human mind?

18:11.680 --> 18:16.640
 You mentioned kind of an ego loss experience in the space of Venn diagrams.

18:16.640 --> 18:23.720
 If we were to draw a big circle, what can we say about that big circle?

18:23.720 --> 18:30.800
 In terms of people's report of subjective experience, probably one of the most general

18:30.800 --> 18:35.280
 things we can say is that it expands that range.

18:35.280 --> 18:41.720
 So many people come out of these sessions saying that they didn't know it was possible

18:41.720 --> 18:44.160
 to have an experience like that.

18:44.160 --> 18:49.840
 So there's an emphasis on the subjective experience.

18:49.840 --> 18:57.400
 Is there words that people put to it that capture that experience or is it something

18:57.400 --> 19:02.080
 that just has to be experienced?

19:02.080 --> 19:09.000
 As a researcher, that's an interesting question because you have to kind of measure the effects

19:09.000 --> 19:10.560
 of this.

19:10.560 --> 19:14.120
 And how do you convert that into numbers?

19:14.120 --> 19:15.920
 That's the ultimate challenge.

19:15.920 --> 19:21.200
 Is that possible to one, convert it into words and the second, convert the words into

19:21.200 --> 19:22.360
 numbers somehow?

19:22.360 --> 19:28.120
 So we do a lot of that with questionnaires, some of which are very psychometrically validated.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.760
 So lots of numbers have been crunched on them.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.560
 And there's always a limitation with questionnaires.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.800
 I mean, subjective effects are subjective effects.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.640
 Ultimately, it's what the person is reporting.

19:39.640 --> 19:45.600
 That doesn't necessarily point towards a ground truth.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.920
 So for example, if someone says that they felt like they touched another dimension or

19:48.920 --> 19:57.480
 they felt like they sensed the reality of God or if they, I mean, just you name it,

19:57.480 --> 20:01.120
 people's ontological views can sometimes shift.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.880
 I think that's more about where they're coming from and I don't think it's the quintessential

20:04.880 --> 20:05.880
 way in which they work.

20:05.880 --> 20:10.640
 There's plenty of people that hold onto a completely naturalistic viewpoint and have

20:10.640 --> 20:16.960
 profound and helpful experiences with these compounds.

20:16.960 --> 20:24.600
 But the subjective effects can be so broad that for some people, it shifts their philosophical

20:24.600 --> 20:32.640
 viewpoint more towards idealism, more towards thinking of that the nature of reality might

20:32.640 --> 20:38.360
 be more about consciousness than about material.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.400
 That's a domain I'm very interested in.

20:40.400 --> 20:45.600
 Right now, we have essentially zero to say about that in terms of validating those types

20:45.600 --> 20:49.160
 of claims, but it's even interesting just to see what people say along those lines.

20:49.160 --> 20:54.600
 So you're interested in saying, like, can we more rigorously study this process of expansion?

20:54.600 --> 21:01.680
 Like, what do we mean by this expansion of your sense of what is possible in the experiences

21:01.680 --> 21:02.680
 in this world?

21:02.680 --> 21:03.680
 Right.

21:03.680 --> 21:08.560
 As much as what we can say about that through naturalistic psychology, especially as much

21:08.560 --> 21:16.280
 as we can root it to solid psychological constructs and solid neuroscientific constructs.

21:16.280 --> 21:20.640
 And I wonder what the impact is of the language that you bring to the table.

21:20.640 --> 21:26.360
 So you mentioned about God or, speaking of God, a lot of people are really into sort

21:26.360 --> 21:31.040
 of theoretical physics these days at a very surface level and you can bring the language

21:31.040 --> 21:32.040
 of physics.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.040
 Right.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.040
 You can talk about quantum mechanics.

21:34.040 --> 21:39.440
 You can talk about general relativity and curvature of space time and using just that

21:39.440 --> 21:45.800
 language without a deep technical understanding of it to somehow start thinking like sort

21:45.800 --> 21:51.160
 of visualizing atoms in your head and somehow through that process, because you have the

21:51.160 --> 21:57.600
 language using that language to kind of dissolve the ego, like realize that we're just all

21:57.600 --> 22:02.920
 little bits of physical objects that behave in mysterious ways.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.880
 And so that has to do with the language.

22:04.880 --> 22:09.760
 Like if you read a Sean Carroll book or something recently, it seems like as a huge influence

22:09.760 --> 22:17.960
 on the way you might experience, might perceive the world and might experience the alteration

22:17.960 --> 22:23.360
 that psychedelics brings to the, to the your perception system.

22:23.360 --> 22:28.280
 So I wonder like the language you bring to the table, how that affects the journey you

22:28.280 --> 22:30.400
 go on with the psychedelics.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.040
 I think very much so.

22:33.040 --> 22:36.320
 And I think there's, I'm a little concerned, some of the science is going a little too

22:36.320 --> 22:44.400
 far in the direction of, around the edges, speaking about it, changing beliefs in this

22:44.400 --> 22:48.840
 sense or that sense about particular, in particular domains.

22:48.840 --> 22:54.120
 And I think what really what a lot of what's going on is what you just discussed, it's

22:54.120 --> 22:56.880
 the priors coming into, into it.

22:56.880 --> 23:03.280
 So if you're been reading a lot of, you know, physics, then you might, you know, bring

23:03.280 --> 23:08.080
 up, you know, like, you know, space time and interpret the experience in that sense.

23:08.080 --> 23:12.600
 I mean, it's not uncommon for people come out talking about visions of the, it's not

23:12.600 --> 23:18.280
 the most typical thing, but it's come up in sessions, I've, I've guided the Big Bang

23:18.280 --> 23:21.720
 and the, you know, this sort of nature of reality.

23:21.720 --> 23:27.440
 I think probably the best way to think about these experiences is that, and the best evidence,

23:27.440 --> 23:32.360
 even though we're in our infancy and understanding it, that they really tap into more general

23:32.360 --> 23:34.720
 psychological mechanisms.

23:34.720 --> 23:39.880
 I think one of the best arguments is they, they, they, they reduce the influence of the,

23:39.880 --> 23:46.560
 of our priors of what we bring into the, all of the assumptions that we all that, you know,

23:46.560 --> 23:50.240
 were essentially, especially as adults were riding on top of heuristic after heuristic

23:50.240 --> 23:52.400
 to get through life.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.400
 And you need to do that.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.400
 And that's a good thing.

23:54.400 --> 24:00.160
 And that's extremely efficient and evolution has shaped that, but that comes at an expense.

24:00.160 --> 24:10.320
 And it seems that these experiences will, will allow someone greater mental flexibility

24:10.320 --> 24:12.120
 and openness.

24:12.120 --> 24:21.200
 And so one can be both less influenced by their, their prior assumptions, but still nonetheless,

24:21.200 --> 24:25.560
 the nature of the experience can be influenced by what they've been exposed to in the world.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.560
 And sometimes they can get it at a deeper, in a deeper way.

24:28.560 --> 24:33.280
 Like maybe they've read, I mean, I had a philosophy professor at one time as a, as a participant

24:33.280 --> 24:35.160
 in a high dose psilocybin study.

24:35.160 --> 24:40.240
 And he's like, I remember him saying, my God, it's like Hagel's opposites defining each

24:40.240 --> 24:41.240
 other.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.240
 I get it.

24:42.240 --> 24:46.480
 I've taught this thing for, you know, years and years and years, like I get it now.

24:46.480 --> 24:51.600
 And so like that, you know, and, and even at the psychological emotional level, like

24:51.600 --> 24:56.320
 the cancer patients we worked with, you know, they told themselves a million times over

24:56.320 --> 24:57.640
 the people trying to quit smoking.

24:57.640 --> 24:58.640
 I need to quit smoking.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.760
 Oh, I'm ruining my life with this cancer.

25:00.760 --> 25:01.760
 I'm still healthy.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.760
 I should be getting out.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.760
 I'm letting this thing defeat me.

25:03.760 --> 25:07.760
 It's like, yeah, you told yourself that in your head, but sometimes they had these experiences

25:07.760 --> 25:10.280
 and they kind of feel it in their heart.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.120
 Like they really get it.

25:12.120 --> 25:20.840
 So in some sense that you bring some prize to the table, but psychedelics allow you to

25:20.840 --> 25:23.440
 acknowledge them and then throw them away.

25:23.440 --> 25:28.720
 So like one popular terminology around this in the engineering space is first principles

25:28.720 --> 25:33.920
 thinking that Elon Musk, for example, espouses a lot.

25:33.920 --> 25:39.640
 Let me ask a fun question before we return to a more serious discussion.

25:39.640 --> 25:45.240
 But Elon Musk as an example, but it could be just engineers in general.

25:45.240 --> 25:53.560
 Do you think there's a use for psychedelics to take a journey of rigorous first principles

25:53.560 --> 25:54.560
 thinking?

25:54.560 --> 25:59.120
 So like throwing away, we're not talking about throwing away assumptions about the nature

25:59.120 --> 26:04.200
 of reality in terms of like our philosophy of the way we live day to day life, but we're

26:04.200 --> 26:10.520
 talking about like how to build a better rocket or how to build a better car or how to build

26:10.520 --> 26:14.960
 a better social network or all those kinds of things, engineering questions.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.800
 I absolutely think there's huge potential there.

26:17.800 --> 26:25.320
 And there was some research in the late 60s, early 70s that was very early and not very

26:25.320 --> 26:32.320
 rigorous in terms of methodology, but it was consistent with the, I mean, there's just

26:32.320 --> 26:38.800
 countless anecdotes of folks, I mean, people have argued that just Silicon Valley was largely

26:38.800 --> 26:41.480
 influenced by psychedelic experience.

26:41.480 --> 26:46.360
 I remember the, I think the person that came up with the concept of freeware or shareware,

26:46.360 --> 26:53.800
 it's like it kind of was generated out of or influenced by psychedelic experience.

26:53.800 --> 27:00.080
 So to this, I think there's incredible potential there and we know really next, there's no

27:00.080 --> 27:05.680
 rigorous research on that, but is there anecdotal stuff like with Steve Jobs?

27:05.680 --> 27:07.800
 I think there's stories, right?

27:07.800 --> 27:12.800
 In your exploration of the, is there something a little bit more than just stories?

27:12.800 --> 27:16.640
 Is there like a little bit more of a solid data points?

27:16.640 --> 27:22.680
 Even if they're just experiential like anecdotes, is there something that you draw inspiration

27:22.680 --> 27:24.200
 from like in your intuition?

27:24.200 --> 27:28.280
 Because we'll talk about you're trying to construct studies that are more rigorous around

27:28.280 --> 27:29.560
 these questions.

27:29.560 --> 27:34.280
 But is there something you draw inspiration from from the past from the 80s and the 90s

27:34.280 --> 27:37.720
 and Silicon Valley, that kind of space?

27:37.720 --> 27:43.200
 Or is it just like you have a sense based on everything you've learned and these kind

27:43.200 --> 27:47.440
 of loose stories that there's something worth digging at?

27:47.440 --> 27:55.400
 I am influenced by the, gosh, the just incredible number of anecdotes surrounding these.

27:55.400 --> 28:05.960
 I mean, Kerry Mullis, he invented PCR, I mean, absolutely revolutionized biological sciences.

28:05.960 --> 28:09.520
 He says he wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize from it, said he wouldn't have come up with

28:09.520 --> 28:13.960
 that had he not had psychedelic experiences.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.760
 You know, now he's an interesting character.

28:15.760 --> 28:20.040
 People should read his autobiography because you could point to other things he was into.

28:20.040 --> 28:23.880
 But I think that speaks to the casting your nets wide and this mental flex.

28:23.880 --> 28:29.840
 Or these general mechanisms where sometimes if you cast your nets really wide and it's

28:29.840 --> 28:38.240
 going to depend on the person and their influences, but sometimes you come up with false positives.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.320
 You connect the dots where maybe you shouldn't have connected those dots.

28:41.320 --> 28:48.600
 But I think that can be constrained and so much of our, not only a personal psychological

28:48.600 --> 28:57.560
 suffering, but our limitations academically and in terms of technology are because of

28:57.560 --> 29:04.560
 the self imposed limitations and heuristics, these entrance ways of thinking, like those

29:04.560 --> 29:09.440
 examples throughout the history of science where someone has come up with the paradigm

29:09.440 --> 29:10.440
 ships.

29:10.440 --> 29:14.640
 It's like, here's something completely different.

29:14.640 --> 29:20.960
 This doesn't make sense by any of the previous models and we need more of those and then

29:20.960 --> 29:26.000
 you need the right balance between that because so many of the novel crazy ideas are just

29:26.000 --> 29:33.960
 bunk and that's what science is about separating them from the valid paradigm shifting ideas.

29:33.960 --> 29:39.080
 But we need more paradigm shifting ideas in a big way.

29:39.080 --> 29:45.360
 And I think you could argue that we've, because of the structure of academia and science in

29:45.360 --> 29:49.000
 modern times, it heavily biases against those.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
 Right.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.880
 There's all kinds of mechanisms in our human nature that resist paradigm shift quite sort

29:54.880 --> 29:58.360
 of obviously.

29:58.360 --> 30:02.160
 And psychedelics, there could be a lot of other tools, but it seems like psychedelics

30:02.160 --> 30:09.140
 could be one set of tools that encourage paradigm shifting thinking.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.480
 So like the first principle is kind of thinking.

30:11.480 --> 30:16.440
 So it's a kind of, you're at the forefront of research here.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.080
 There's just kind of anecdotal stories.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.440
 There's early studies.

30:21.440 --> 30:26.840
 There's a sense that we don't understand very much, but there's a lot of depth here.

30:26.840 --> 30:33.000
 How do we get from there to where Elon and I can regularly, like I wake up every morning,

30:33.000 --> 30:41.960
 I have deep work sessions where it's well understood, like what dose to take.

30:41.960 --> 30:47.400
 Like if I want to explore something where it's all legal, where it's all understood

30:47.400 --> 30:53.800
 and safe, all that kind of stuff, how do we get from where we are today to there?

30:53.800 --> 30:59.240
 Not speaking in terms of legality in the sense like policymaking, all that like laws

30:59.240 --> 31:04.680
 and stuff, meaning like how do we scientifically understand this stuff well enough to get to

31:04.680 --> 31:11.320
 a place where I can just take it safely in order to expand my thinking, like this kind

31:11.320 --> 31:15.080
 of first principles thinking, which I mean, my personal life currently doing, like how

31:15.080 --> 31:18.560
 do I have revolutionized particular several things?

31:18.560 --> 31:27.240
 Like it seems like the only tools I have right now, it's just just, but my mind going, doing

31:27.240 --> 31:30.160
 the first principles like, wait, wait, wait, okay.

31:30.160 --> 31:31.840
 Why has this been done this way?

31:31.840 --> 31:33.880
 Can we do it completely differently?

31:33.880 --> 31:39.760
 It seems like I'm still tethered to the priors that I bring to the table and I keep trying

31:39.760 --> 31:41.040
 to untether myself.

31:41.040 --> 31:44.280
 Maybe there's tools that can systematically help me untether.

31:44.280 --> 31:52.320
 Yeah, well, we need experiments and that's tied to the policy level stuff and I should

31:52.320 --> 32:00.760
 be clear, I would never encourage anyone to do anything illicitly, but yeah, in the future,

32:00.760 --> 32:08.480
 we could see these compounds used for technical and scientific innovation.

32:08.480 --> 32:13.800
 What we need are studies that are digging into that right now, most of what the funding,

32:13.800 --> 32:21.000
 which is largely from philanthropy, not from the government, largely what it's for is treatment

32:21.000 --> 32:28.840
 of mental disorders like addiction and depression, et cetera, but we need studies.

32:28.840 --> 32:36.280
 One of the early initial stabs on this question decades ago was they took some architects

32:36.280 --> 32:40.960
 and engineers and said, what problems have you been working on?

32:40.960 --> 32:44.240
 Very you've been stuck for months like working on this damn thing and you're not getting

32:44.240 --> 32:48.320
 anywhere like your head's butting up against the wall.

32:48.320 --> 32:53.160
 Come in here, take, and I think it was 100 micrograms of LSD, so not a big session and

32:53.160 --> 32:55.960
 a little bit different model where they were actually working, it was a moderate enough

32:55.960 --> 33:00.840
 dose where they could work on the problem during the session.

33:00.840 --> 33:06.840
 I think probably, I'm an empiricist so I'd like to see all the studies done, but the

33:06.840 --> 33:10.840
 first thing I would do is a really high dose session where you're not necessarily in front

33:10.840 --> 33:16.120
 of your computer, which you can't really do on a really high dose.

33:16.120 --> 33:21.600
 And then the work has been talked about, you take a really high dose, you take a journey

33:21.600 --> 33:27.240
 and then the breakthroughs come from when you return from the journey and integrate quote

33:27.240 --> 33:29.000
 unquote that experience.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.680
 I think that's where all the head, and again, we're babies at this point, but my gut tells

33:34.680 --> 33:38.280
 me that it's the so called integration, the aftermath.

33:38.280 --> 33:41.800
 We know that there's some different forms of neuroplasticity that are unfolding in the

33:41.800 --> 33:45.120
 days following a psychedelics, at least in animals.

33:45.120 --> 33:48.840
 Probably going on humans, we don't know if that's related to the therapeutic effects.

33:48.840 --> 33:54.320
 My gut tells me it is, although it's only part of the story, but we need big studies

33:54.320 --> 33:59.240
 where we compare people, like let's get 100 people like that, scientists that are working

33:59.240 --> 34:02.400
 on a problem, and then randomize them too.

34:02.400 --> 34:10.040
 And then I think you need a even more credible active controls or active placebo conditions

34:10.040 --> 34:13.400
 to kind of tease this out.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.520
 And then also in conjunction with that, and you can do this in the same study, you want

34:16.520 --> 34:23.600
 to combine that with more rigorous sort of experimental models where we actually get

34:23.600 --> 34:27.560
 there are problem solving tasks that we know, for example, that you tend to do better on

34:27.560 --> 34:30.280
 after you've gotten a good night's sleep versus not.

34:30.280 --> 34:34.080
 And my sense is there's a relationship there.

34:34.080 --> 34:39.480
 People go back to first principles, questioning those first principles they're operating under,

34:39.480 --> 34:45.480
 and getting away from their priors in terms of creative problem solving.

34:45.480 --> 34:49.880
 And so I think you wrap those things, and you could speak a little more rigorously about

34:49.880 --> 34:50.880
 those.

34:50.880 --> 34:56.160
 Because ultimately, if everyone's bringing their own problem, that's more in the face

34:56.160 --> 35:01.760
 of outside, but you can't dig in as much and get as much experimental power and speak to

35:01.760 --> 35:07.680
 the mechanisms as you can with having everyone do the same sort of canned problem solving

35:07.680 --> 35:08.680
 task.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.040
 So we've been speaking about psychedelics generally.

35:11.040 --> 35:16.200
 Is there one you find from the scientific perspective or maybe even philosophical perspective

35:16.200 --> 35:18.680
 most fascinating to study?

35:18.680 --> 35:23.600
 Therapeutically, I'm most interested in psilocybin and LSD, and I think we need to do a lot more

35:23.600 --> 35:27.000
 with LSD because it's mainly been psilocybin in the modern era.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.320
 I've recently gotten a grant from the Hefter Research Institute to do an LSD study, so

35:32.320 --> 35:36.920
 I haven't started it yet, but I'm going through the paperwork and everything.

35:36.920 --> 35:41.760
 Therapeutic meaning there's some issue and you're trying to treat that issue.

35:41.760 --> 35:47.640
 In terms of just what's the most fascinating, understanding the nature of these experiences,

35:47.640 --> 35:52.520
 if you really want to wrap your head around what's going on when someone has a completely

35:52.520 --> 35:59.680
 altered sense of reality and sense of self, there I think you're talking about the high

35:59.680 --> 36:06.360
 dose, either smoked vaporized or intravenous injection, which all kind of, they're very

36:06.360 --> 36:12.320
 similar pharmacologically, of DMT and five methoxy DMT.

36:12.320 --> 36:15.800
 This is like when people, this is what, I don't know if you're familiar with Terence

36:15.800 --> 36:20.960
 McKinnon, he would talk a lot about smoking DMT, Joe Rogan has talked a lot about that.

36:20.960 --> 36:24.680
 People will say that, and there's a close relative called five methoxy DMT.

36:24.680 --> 36:29.880
 Most people who know the terrain will say that's an order of magnitude or orders of

36:29.880 --> 36:37.140
 magnitude beyond anything one could get from even a high dose of psilocybin or LSD.

36:37.140 --> 36:41.680
 I think it's a question about whether, how therapeutic, I think there is a therapeutic

36:41.680 --> 36:47.920
 potential there, but it's probably not as sure of a bet because one goes so far out,

36:47.920 --> 36:51.880
 it's almost like they're not contemplating their relationship in their direction in life.

36:51.880 --> 36:59.200
 They are like, reality is ripping apart at the seams and the very nature of the self

36:59.200 --> 37:03.080
 and of the sense of reality.

37:03.080 --> 37:08.880
 The amazing thing about these compounds, and same to a less degree with oral psilocybin

37:08.880 --> 37:17.720
 and LSD is that unlike some other drugs that really throw you far out there, anesthetics.

37:17.720 --> 37:23.320
 Even alcohol, as reality starts to become different at higher and higher doses, there's

37:23.320 --> 37:32.640
 this numbing, there's this ability for the sense of being the center, having a conscious

37:32.640 --> 37:40.400
 experience that's memorable, that is maintained throughout these classic psychedelic experiences.

37:40.400 --> 37:51.200
 One can go as far, so far out while still being aware of the experience and remembering

37:51.200 --> 37:52.200
 the experience.

37:52.200 --> 37:56.800
 Interesting, so being able to carry something back.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.120
 Can you dig in a little deeper?

37:59.120 --> 38:01.480
 What is DMT?

38:01.480 --> 38:04.240
 How long is the trip usually?

38:04.240 --> 38:06.400
 How much do we understand about it?

38:06.400 --> 38:13.800
 Is there something interesting to say about the nature of the experience and what we understand

38:13.800 --> 38:14.800
 about it?

38:14.800 --> 38:21.800
 One of the common methods for people to use it is to smoke it or vaporize it.

38:21.800 --> 38:26.640
 This is a pretty good kind of description of what it might feel like on the ground.

38:26.640 --> 38:33.040
 The caveat is it's a completely insufficient description and someone's going to be listening.

38:33.040 --> 38:38.520
 It's like nothing you could say is going to come close, but it'll take about three big

38:38.520 --> 38:46.480
 hits, inhalations, in order to have what people call a breakthrough dose.

38:46.480 --> 38:54.240
 There's no great definition of that, but basically meaning moving away from not just having the

38:54.240 --> 38:58.480
 typical psilocybin or LSD experience where things are radically different, but you're

38:58.480 --> 39:05.040
 still basically a person in this reality to go in somewhere else.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.960
 That'll typically take three hits.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.000
 This stuff comes on like a freight train.

39:11.000 --> 39:17.080
 One takes a hit and around the time of the first exhalation, we're talking about a few

39:17.080 --> 39:22.960
 seconds in, or maybe just sometime between the first and the second hit, it'll start

39:22.960 --> 39:25.160
 to come on.

39:25.160 --> 39:34.000
 They're already up to, say, what they might get from a 30 milligram or 300 microgram LSD

39:34.000 --> 39:35.480
 trip, a big trip.

39:35.480 --> 39:40.920
 They're already there at the second hit, but they're going, their consciousness is gear.

39:40.920 --> 39:46.040
 This is like acceleration, not speed to speak of physics.

39:46.040 --> 39:50.200
 Those receptors are getting filled like that and they're going from zero to 60 in like

39:50.200 --> 39:53.720
 Tesla time.

39:53.720 --> 39:57.800
 At the second hit, again, they're at maybe the strongest psychedelic experience they've

39:57.800 --> 39:59.680
 ever had.

39:59.680 --> 40:10.440
 If they can take that third hit, even some people can't, they're propelled into this

40:10.440 --> 40:11.440
 other reality.

40:11.440 --> 40:17.960
 The nature of that other reality will differ depending on who you ask, but folks will often

40:17.960 --> 40:25.840
 talk about, and we've done some survey research on this, entities of different types, elves

40:25.840 --> 40:27.680
 tend to pop up.

40:27.680 --> 40:33.960
 The caveat is, I strongly presume all of this is culturally influenced, but thinking more

40:33.960 --> 40:40.160
 about the psychology and the neuroscience, there is probably something fundamental.

40:40.160 --> 40:46.680
 For someone that might be colored as elves, others that might be colored as, Terrence McKinnon

40:46.680 --> 40:48.920
 called himself dribbling basketballs.

40:48.920 --> 40:54.080
 For someone else, it might be little animals or someone else, it might be aliens.

40:54.080 --> 40:58.160
 I think that probably is dependent on who they are and what they've been exposed to,

40:58.160 --> 41:05.400
 but just the fact that one has this sense that they're surrounded by autonomous entities.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.320
 Intelligent autonomous entities.

41:07.320 --> 41:11.800
 People come back with stories that are just astonishing.

41:11.800 --> 41:19.880
 There's communication between these entities and often they're telling them things that

41:19.880 --> 41:25.640
 the person says are self validating, but it seems like it's impossible.

41:25.640 --> 41:34.160
 It really seems like, and again, this is what people say oftentimes, that it really is downloading

41:34.160 --> 41:39.600
 some intelligence from higher dimension or whatever metaphor you want to use.

41:39.600 --> 41:43.600
 These things come up in dreams where it's like someone is exposed to something that

41:43.600 --> 41:50.840
 I've had this in a dream, where it seems like what they are being exposed to is physically

41:50.840 --> 41:56.760
 impossible, but yet at the same time, self validating, it seems true that they really

41:56.760 --> 41:57.920
 are figuring something out.

41:57.920 --> 42:03.680
 Of course, the challenge is to say something in concrete terms after the experience where

42:03.680 --> 42:11.680
 you could verify that in any way, and I'm not familiar of any examples of that.

42:11.680 --> 42:22.360
 There's a sense in which I suppose the experience is like you're a limited cognitive creature

42:22.360 --> 42:27.920
 that knows very little about the world, and here's a chance to communicate with much wiser

42:27.920 --> 42:36.760
 entities that in a way that you can't possibly understand, are trying to give you hints of

42:36.760 --> 42:42.400
 deeper truths, and so there's that kind of sense that you can take something back, but

42:42.400 --> 42:49.280
 you can't, where our cognition is not capable to fully grasp the truth, we'll just get a

42:49.280 --> 42:54.800
 kind of sense of it, and somehow that process is mind expanding, that there's a greater

42:54.800 --> 43:01.880
 truth out there, that seems like what, from the people I've heard talk about, that seems

43:01.880 --> 43:08.880
 to be what it is, and that's so fascinating that there's fundamentally to this whole thing

43:08.880 --> 43:15.640
 is the communication between an entity that is other than yourself, entities, so it's

43:15.640 --> 43:21.560
 not just like a visual experience, like you're like floating through the world, is there's

43:21.560 --> 43:28.160
 other beings there, which is kind of, I don't know, I don't know what to sort of, from a

43:28.160 --> 43:32.320
 person who likes Freud and Carl Jung, I don't know what to think about that.

43:32.320 --> 43:37.040
 That being, of course, from one perspective is just you looking in the mirror, but it

43:37.040 --> 43:41.360
 could also be from another perspective, like actually talking to other beings.

43:41.360 --> 43:46.040
 Yeah, you mentioned Jung, and I think that's, he's particularly interesting, and it kind

43:46.040 --> 43:51.540
 of points to something I was thinking about saying is that I think what might be going

43:51.540 --> 43:59.320
 on from a naturalistic perspective, so regardless, whether or not there are, it doesn't depend

43:59.320 --> 44:06.680
 on autonomous entities out there, what might be happening is that just the associative

44:06.680 --> 44:18.000
 net, the level of learning, the comprehension might be so beyond what someone is used to

44:18.000 --> 44:26.560
 that the only way for the nervous system, for the aware sense of self to orient towards

44:26.560 --> 44:28.720
 it is all by metaphor.

44:28.720 --> 44:34.960
 And so I do think when we get into these realms as a strong empiricist, I think we always

44:34.960 --> 44:40.840
 got to be careful and be as grounded as possible, but I'm also willing to speculate and sort

44:40.840 --> 44:43.280
 of cast them that's wide with caveat.

44:43.280 --> 44:50.760
 But I think of things like archetypes, and it's plausible that there are certain stories,

44:50.760 --> 44:57.960
 we've gone through millions of years of evolution, it may be that we have certain characters

44:57.960 --> 45:04.760
 and stories that are central nervous system is sort of wired to tend to…

45:04.760 --> 45:09.640
 Yeah, those stories, we carry those stories in us, and this unlocks them in a certain

45:09.640 --> 45:10.640
 kind of way.

45:10.640 --> 45:15.200
 And we think about stories, like our sense of self is basically narrative self is a story.

45:15.200 --> 45:20.560
 And we think about the world of stories, this is why metaphors are always more powerful

45:20.560 --> 45:27.000
 than sort of laying out all the details all the time, speaking in parables, it's like

45:27.000 --> 45:28.600
 if you really get something…

45:28.600 --> 45:33.480
 This is why as much as I hate it, if you're presenting to Congress or something and you

45:33.480 --> 45:41.000
 have all the best data in the world, it's not as powerful as that one anecdote as the

45:41.000 --> 45:46.720
 mom dying of cancer that had the psilocybin session and it transformed her life, that's

45:46.720 --> 45:48.560
 a story that's meaningful.

45:48.560 --> 45:59.000
 And so when this kind of unimaginable kind of change and experience happens with DMT

45:59.000 --> 46:06.240
 ingestion, these stories of entities, they might be that, stories that are constructed

46:06.240 --> 46:10.360
 that is the closest, which is not to say the stories aren't real, I mean, I think we're

46:10.360 --> 46:16.960
 getting to layers where it doesn't really, right, yeah, yeah, but it's the closest

46:16.960 --> 46:22.440
 we can come to making sense out of it because what we do know about these psychedelics,

46:22.440 --> 46:26.360
 one of the levels beyond the receptor is that the brain is communicating it with itself

46:26.360 --> 46:28.600
 in a massively different way.

46:28.600 --> 46:32.680
 There's massive communication with areas that don't normally communicate.

46:32.680 --> 46:38.600
 And so I think that comes with both, it's casting the nets wide.

46:38.600 --> 46:43.440
 I think that comes with the insights and helpful novel ways of thinking, I do think it comes

46:43.440 --> 46:48.800
 with false positives, that could be some of the delusion.

46:48.800 --> 46:57.920
 And so when you're so far out there, like with DMT experience, like maybe alien is the

46:57.920 --> 47:02.600
 best way that the mind can wrap some arms around that.

47:02.600 --> 47:07.600
 So I don't know how much you're familiar with Joe Rogan, but he does bring up DMT quite

47:07.600 --> 47:08.600
 a bit.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.600
 It's almost a meme.

47:09.600 --> 47:10.600
 It is a meme.

47:10.600 --> 47:11.600
 Right.

47:11.600 --> 47:14.440
 Have you ever, what is it, have you ever tried DMT?

47:14.440 --> 47:25.200
 I mean, I think he talks about this experience of having met other entities and they were

47:25.200 --> 47:26.680
 mocking him, I think.

47:26.680 --> 47:31.480
 If I remember the experience correctly, like laughing at him and saying FU, FU or something

47:31.480 --> 47:32.480
 like that.

47:32.480 --> 47:37.520
 I may be misremembering this, but there's a general mockery.

47:37.520 --> 47:42.680
 And what he learned from that experience is that he shouldn't take himself too seriously.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.640
 So it's the dissolution of the ego and so on.

47:45.640 --> 47:50.920
 What do you think about that experience and maybe if you have more general things about

47:50.920 --> 47:59.920
 the Joe's infatuation with DMT and if DMT has that important role to play in popular

47:59.920 --> 48:01.920
 culture in general?

48:01.920 --> 48:03.360
 I'm definitely familiar with it.

48:03.360 --> 48:08.600
 I remember telling you offline that when I first, the first time I learned who Joe Rogan

48:08.600 --> 48:14.680
 was, it's probably 15 years ago and I came upon a clip and I realized there's another

48:14.680 --> 48:19.800
 person in the world who's into both DMT and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and I think both those

48:19.800 --> 48:24.480
 worlds have grown dramatically since and it's probably not such a special club these days.

48:24.480 --> 48:29.360
 So he definitely got onto my radar screen quickly.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.560
 You weren't to both before was cool.

48:31.560 --> 48:32.560
 Right.

48:32.560 --> 48:36.740
 I mean, it's all relative because there's people that were before the late 90s and early

48:36.740 --> 48:40.000
 2000s who were into it to say, you're a Johnny come lately.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.520
 But yeah, compared to where we're at now.

48:42.520 --> 48:51.960
 But yet one of the things I always found fascinating by Joe's telling of his experiences I think

48:51.960 --> 48:59.080
 is that they resemble very much Terrence McKenna's experiences with DMT and Joe has talked very

48:59.080 --> 49:03.320
 much about Terrence McKenna and his experiences.

49:03.320 --> 49:08.960
 If I had to guess, I would guess that probably just having heard Terrence McKenna talk about

49:08.960 --> 49:15.800
 his experiences that influenced the coloring of Joe's experience.

49:15.800 --> 49:23.560
 It's funny how that works because I mean, that's why McKenna has poets and great orders

49:23.560 --> 49:29.400
 give us the words to then start to describe our experiences because our words are limited,

49:29.400 --> 49:34.360
 our language is limited and it's always nice to get some kind of nice poetry into the mix

49:34.360 --> 49:37.600
 to allow us to put words to it.

49:37.600 --> 49:44.000
 But I also see some elements that seem to relate to Joe's psychology, just from what

49:44.000 --> 49:52.400
 I've seen from hours of watching him on his podcast is that he's a self critical guy.

49:52.400 --> 49:56.640
 And I think with always his positive been, I'm always struck being a behavioral pharmacologist

49:56.640 --> 49:59.120
 and no one else really says it about cannabis.

49:59.120 --> 50:03.320
 I'll get back to the DMT thing about he likes the paranoid side of things.

50:03.320 --> 50:05.880
 He's like, that's you radically examining yourself.

50:05.880 --> 50:10.320
 It's like that's not just a bad thing, that's you need to look hard at yourself and something's

50:10.320 --> 50:16.080
 making you uncomfortable, dig into that and it's sort of along the lines of Goggins with

50:16.080 --> 50:22.120
 exercise and it's like, yeah, things, learning experiences aren't supposed to be easy.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.840
 Take advantage of these uncomfortable experience.

50:24.840 --> 50:30.280
 It's why we call in our research in a safe context, psychedelics, they're not bad trips,

50:30.280 --> 50:31.960
 they're challenging experiences.

50:31.960 --> 50:36.240
 Yes, so yeah, it's fascinating just that's a tiny tangent.

50:36.240 --> 50:43.360
 It's always cool for me to hear him talk about marijuana like weed as the paranoia, the

50:43.360 --> 50:50.600
 anxiety or whatever that the experience as actually the fuel for the experience.

50:50.600 --> 50:54.600
 Like I think he talks about smoking weed when he's writing.

50:54.600 --> 50:58.880
 That's inspiring to me because then you can't possibly have a bad experience.

50:58.880 --> 51:02.480
 I'm a huge fan of that, every experience is good.

51:02.480 --> 51:04.680
 Right, which is very Goggins.

51:04.680 --> 51:05.920
 Yeah, it's very Goggins.

51:05.920 --> 51:06.920
 Is it bad?

51:06.920 --> 51:07.920
 Okay.

51:07.920 --> 51:08.920
 All right.

51:08.920 --> 51:09.920
 Great.

51:09.920 --> 51:10.920
 Well, see Goggins is one side of that.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.120
 He wants it bad.

51:12.120 --> 51:18.640
 He wants the experience to be challenging always, but I mean, both are good.

51:18.640 --> 51:26.480
 The few times I've taken mushrooms, the experience was like everything was beautiful.

51:26.480 --> 51:29.960
 There's zero challenging aspect to it.

51:29.960 --> 51:34.960
 It was just like the world is beautiful and it gave me this deep appreciation of the world.

51:34.960 --> 51:41.240
 I would say, so like that's amazing, but also ones that challenge you are also amazing,

51:41.240 --> 51:45.960
 like all the time to drink vodka, but that's another lesson.

51:45.960 --> 51:47.960
 So back to DMT.

51:47.960 --> 51:48.960
 Yeah.

51:48.960 --> 51:54.400
 Joe's treating cannabis as a psychedelic, which is something that I'd say like a lot

51:54.400 --> 52:02.200
 of people treat it more like Xanax or like beer or vodka, but he's really trying to

52:02.200 --> 52:05.800
 delve into those, it's been called a minor psychedelic.

52:05.800 --> 52:11.320
 So with DMT, as you brought up, it's like the entity's mocking him and it's like you're

52:11.320 --> 52:12.320
 not good.

52:12.320 --> 52:19.400
 I mean, this reminds me of him describing his writing his or just his entire method

52:19.400 --> 52:21.600
 of comedy.

52:21.600 --> 52:25.880
 It's like watch the tape of yourself, don't just ignore it.

52:25.880 --> 52:27.440
 That's where I screwed up.

52:27.440 --> 52:32.040
 That's where I need to do better, this sort of radical self examination, which I think

52:32.040 --> 52:36.400
 our society is kind of getting away from because all the children win trophies type

52:36.400 --> 52:37.400
 of thing.

52:37.400 --> 52:42.360
 And it's like, no, don't go overboard, but recognize when you've messed up.

52:42.360 --> 52:46.120
 And so that's a big part of the psychedelic experience.

52:46.120 --> 52:51.280
 People come out sometimes saying, my God, I need to say sorry to my mom.

52:51.280 --> 53:00.400
 But it's so obvious or whatever interpersonal issue or my God, I'm not pulling enough weight

53:00.400 --> 53:03.240
 around the house and helping my wife.

53:03.240 --> 53:08.960
 And these things that are just obvious to them, the self criticism that can be a very

53:08.960 --> 53:12.200
 positive thing if you act on it.

53:12.200 --> 53:16.640
 You've mentioned addiction, maybe we could take a little bit detour into a darker aspect

53:16.640 --> 53:17.640
 of things.

53:17.640 --> 53:22.560
 Or not even darker, it's just an important aspect of things.

53:22.560 --> 53:24.840
 What's the nature of addiction?

53:24.840 --> 53:32.000
 You've mentioned some things within the big umbrella of psychedelics, maybe usually not

53:32.000 --> 53:37.280
 addictive, but maybe MDMA, I think you said might have some addictive properties.

53:37.280 --> 53:44.040
 But the point is stuff outside of the psychedelics umbrella can often be highly addictive.

53:44.040 --> 53:47.480
 So you've studied addiction from several angles.

53:47.480 --> 53:50.200
 One of which is behavioral economics.

53:50.200 --> 53:53.840
 What have you understood about addiction?

53:53.840 --> 54:00.240
 What is addiction from the biological, physiological level to the psychological to whatever is the

54:00.240 --> 54:02.200
 interesting way to talk about addiction?

54:02.200 --> 54:03.200
 Yeah.

54:03.200 --> 54:08.880
 And the lenses that I view addiction through very much are behavioral economic.

54:08.880 --> 54:13.600
 But I also think they converge on, I think it's beautiful at the other end of the spectrum,

54:13.600 --> 54:20.160
 sort of just a completely humanistic psychology perspective.

54:20.160 --> 54:24.840
 And it converges on what people come out of 12 step meetings talking about.

54:24.840 --> 54:30.320
 Can you say what is behavioral economics and what is humanistic psychology?

54:30.320 --> 54:31.320
 What do you mean by that?

54:31.320 --> 54:33.920
 And more importantly, behavioral economics lens.

54:33.920 --> 54:34.920
 What is that?

54:34.920 --> 54:35.920
 Yeah.

54:35.920 --> 54:39.800
 So behavioral economics, my definition of it is the application of economic principles,

54:39.800 --> 54:41.640
 mostly microeconomic principles.

54:41.640 --> 54:51.760
 So understanding the behavior of individual agents surrounding commodities in the marketplace,

54:51.760 --> 55:00.040
 applying microeconomic types of analyses to non economic behavior.

55:00.040 --> 55:05.440
 So basically at one point, psychologists figured out that there's this whole other discipline

55:05.440 --> 55:06.600
 that's been studying behavior.

55:06.600 --> 55:12.520
 It just happened to be all focused on monetary behavior, spending and saving money, et cetera.

55:12.520 --> 55:17.720
 But it comes with all of these principles that can be wildly and fruitfully applied to

55:17.720 --> 55:19.680
 understanding behavior.

55:19.680 --> 55:25.080
 So for example, I've studied things like demand curve analysis of drug consumption.

55:25.080 --> 55:34.520
 So I look at, for example, the tobacco cigarettes and nicotine products through the lens of

55:34.520 --> 55:40.680
 demand curves and in other words, at different prices, if there's different work requirements

55:40.680 --> 55:46.200
 for being able to smoke cigarettes, sort of modeling price.

55:46.200 --> 55:49.600
 Within that price data, there is some indication of addiction.

55:49.600 --> 55:54.720
 How much you, the habits that you form around these particular drugs?

55:54.720 --> 55:56.440
 It's one important dimension.

55:56.440 --> 56:02.040
 So I think a particularly important one there is elasticity or inelasticity, two ends of

56:02.040 --> 56:03.040
 the spectrum.

56:03.040 --> 56:05.680
 So that's the price sensitivity.

56:05.680 --> 56:14.680
 So for example, you could have something that's pretty price inelastic like gasoline.

56:14.680 --> 56:19.080
 So the price of gas at times can keep going up and Americans are just going to pretty

56:19.080 --> 56:24.800
 much buy the same amount of gas or maybe the price of gas doubles, but their consumption

56:24.800 --> 56:26.280
 only decreases by 10%.

56:26.280 --> 56:28.640
 So it's a sub proportional reduction.

56:28.640 --> 56:30.920
 So that's an inelastic.

56:30.920 --> 56:34.520
 And that changes, like you push the price up high enough, I mean, if it was $100 a gallon,

56:34.520 --> 56:39.800
 it would eventually turn, the curve would turn and go downward more drastically and

56:39.800 --> 56:41.560
 it would be elastic.

56:41.560 --> 56:50.200
 But you can apply that to someone who, a regular cigarette smoker who is working for cigarette

56:50.200 --> 56:54.880
 puffs, who has gotten six hours without smoking and you're asking questions like, how many

56:54.880 --> 56:59.160
 times are they willing to pull this knob in the lab during this three hour session?

56:59.160 --> 57:02.480
 And I do a lot of work like this in order to earn a cigarette.

57:02.480 --> 57:05.480
 How does the content of nicotine in that affect it?

57:05.480 --> 57:10.920
 How does the availability of nicotine replacement products like nicotine gum or e cigarettes

57:10.920 --> 57:12.480
 affect those decisions?

57:12.480 --> 57:19.120
 So it's a certain lens of, it's sort of a way to take the classic behavioral psychology

57:19.120 --> 57:24.360
 definition of reinforcement, which is just basically reward.

57:24.360 --> 57:25.360
 How much is this a good thing?

57:25.360 --> 57:31.160
 And it kind of breaks that apart into a multi dimensional space.

57:31.160 --> 57:36.240
 So it's not just the idea is reward or reinforcement is not unit dimensional.

57:36.240 --> 57:39.640
 So for example, you can unpack that with demand curves.

57:39.640 --> 57:44.240
 At a cheap price, you might prefer one good to another.

57:44.240 --> 57:49.640
 So the classic example is luxury versus necessity, so diamonds versus toilet paper.

57:49.640 --> 57:54.160
 So at those cheap prices, you can look at something called intensity of demand.

57:54.160 --> 57:59.000
 If it was basically as cheap as possible or essentially zero, how much would you buy of

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
 this good?

58:00.000 --> 58:04.760
 But then you keep jacking up the price and you'll see, so diamonds will look like the

58:04.760 --> 58:10.040
 better reward at that low price or of intensity of demand side of things.

58:10.040 --> 58:12.720
 But as you keep jacking up the price, you got to have some toilet paper.

58:12.720 --> 58:13.720
 Yes.

58:13.720 --> 58:18.040
 And again, we can get into the whole like bidet thing, but forget that, you know, like, I

58:18.040 --> 58:23.600
 know Joe's been pushing that too, but you're going to hang on and keep buying the toilet

58:23.600 --> 58:26.740
 paper to a greater degree than you will the diamonds.

58:26.740 --> 58:29.000
 So you'll see a crossing of demand curves.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
 So what's the better reinforcer?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.680
 What's the better reward depends on your price, you know?

58:33.680 --> 58:39.560
 And so that's one, that's an example of one way to, in that, of look at addiction.

58:39.560 --> 58:45.360
 So specifically drug consumption, which is, isn't all of addiction, but it's like, in

58:45.360 --> 58:52.080
 order for something to be addictive, it has to be a reward and it has to compete with

58:52.080 --> 58:54.720
 other rewards in your life.

58:54.720 --> 59:00.200
 And one of the two main aspects of addiction in my, in my view, and this doesn't map onto

59:00.200 --> 59:05.040
 how the, you know, the DSM, the psychiatry Bible defines addiction, which I think is

59:05.040 --> 59:08.880
 largely bunk, you know, but there's some value to have some common description.

59:08.880 --> 59:15.400
 But it's, you know, how rewarding is it from this multi dimensional lens?

59:15.400 --> 59:22.560
 And specifically, how does it, how does that rewarding value compete with other rewards,

59:22.560 --> 59:25.240
 other consequences in your life?

59:25.240 --> 59:32.240
 So it's, it's not a problem if, if the use of that substance is rewarding, you know,

59:32.240 --> 59:35.600
 okay, yeah, you like to have a couple beers every once in a while and it's like not a

59:35.600 --> 59:38.280
 problem.

59:38.280 --> 59:46.080
 But then you have the alcoholic who is drinking so much that they, it tanks their career,

59:46.080 --> 59:47.840
 it ruins their marriage.

59:47.840 --> 59:52.360
 It's in competition with these pro social aspects to their life.

59:52.360 --> 59:56.760
 It's all about comparing to the other choices you're making, the other activities in your

59:56.760 --> 59:57.760
 life.

59:57.760 --> 1:00:04.960
 And if it, you evaluate it as a much higher reward than anything else that becomes an

1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:05.960
 addiction.

1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:06.960
 Right.

1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:10.560
 So it's the rewarding value, but it's the relative rewarding value.

1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:15.800
 And in the other major aspect, again, from behavioral economics, the thing that makes

1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:20.480
 addiction is something called delayed discounting.

1:00:20.480 --> 1:00:23.840
 So in economics, sometimes it's called time preference.

1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:26.960
 This is the, it's what compound interest rates are based upon.

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:33.940
 It's the idea that delaying a good access to a good or reward comes with a certain decrement

1:00:33.940 --> 1:00:35.240
 to its value.

1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:38.160
 So we'd all rather have things now than later.

1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:45.120
 And we can study this at the individual level of, you know, would you rather have $9 today

1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:49.000
 or $10 tomorrow?

1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:55.160
 And you get, when you do that, you get huge differences between addicted populations and

1:00:55.160 --> 1:01:00.200
 non addicted, not just heroin and cocaine, but like just cigarette smokers, like normal,

1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:02.480
 everyday cigarette smokers.

1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:06.680
 And even when you look at something like, you know, monetary rewards.

1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:10.700
 And so you can go into the rabbit hole with, with this delayed discounting model.

1:01:10.700 --> 1:01:15.600
 So it's not only those huge differences that seem to have a face valid aspect to it, like

1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:20.400
 the cigarette smoker is choosing this thing that's rewarding today, but I know it comes

1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:24.080
 with increased risk of having these horrible consequences down the line.

1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:28.560
 So it's this competition between what's good for me now and what's good for me later.

1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:35.000
 And the other aspect about delayed discounting is that if you quantitatively map out that,

1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:42.040
 that discounting curve over time, so you don't just do the, you know, how much, you know,

1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:45.280
 that $10 tomorrow, how much is it worth to you today?

1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:46.520
 So you can say, what about nine?

1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:47.520
 What about eight?

1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:48.520
 What about $7?

1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:51.120
 And you can titrate it to find that in difference point.

1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:57.800
 And so we can say, aha, $6, you know, $10 tomorrow is worth $6 to you today.

1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:01.080
 So it's by the one day, it's decreased by 40%.

1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:07.360
 We can do that also at one week and one month and one year and 10 years and map out that

1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:09.600
 curve, get a shape of that curve.

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:13.800
 And one of the fascinating things about this is that whether you're talking about pigeons,

1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:16.920
 making these types of choices between a little bit of food now or a little bit of food a

1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:23.000
 minute from now or rats or every, like dozens of species of animals tested, including humans,

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:31.400
 the tendency is pretty consistently that we discount hyperbolically rather than exponentially.

1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:36.440
 What exponentially means is that every unit of time is associated with the same proportional

1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:41.440
 reduction, every unit of delay is associated with the same causes, the same proportional

1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:43.000
 reduction in value.

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:49.200
 And that's the way the compound interest rate, you know, works, you know, that there's, you

1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:53.760
 know, compound every day, you know, you get this sort of out of whatever values in there

1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:58.080
 at the beginning of that day, you get this, you know, we'll give you this amount of extra

1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:01.400
 money to compensate you for that delay.

1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:07.840
 But then the way that all animals tend to function is of this very different way where

1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:13.720
 the reductions, the initial, that initial delay, so like one day's worth of delay, you

1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:20.480
 see a much stronger discounting rate or reduction in value than you do over those.

1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:26.240
 So you see the super proportional, then it changes to these lesser rates.

1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:29.800
 And so the implication of that, I know I've gone like really into the weeds quantitatively,

1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:35.120
 but what that means is that there's these preference reversals when you have curves

1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:47.200
 of that nature, the decay that's hyperbolic, it maps onto this phenomenon we see both in

1:03:47.200 --> 1:03:52.920
 terms of how people deal with future rewards, but also how perception works.

1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:57.680
 When two things are far away, whether it's physical distance or whether in terms of perception

1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:03.160
 or whether it's in terms of time, when you're really far away, the value, the subjective

1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:09.280
 value for that further, that delayed reward is larger.

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:20.560
 So for example, let's say we're talking about 360 days from now, you can get $9 or 365 days

1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:26.920
 a year, now you get $10 and you're like, dude, it's a year, no difference, I'll take, why

1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:29.120
 not get one more dollar?

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:33.560
 You bring that same exact set of choices close or nothing's changed other than the time to

1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:38.960
 both rewards and it's like, would you rather have $9 today or $10 tomorrow and plenty of

1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:43.240
 people would say, about the size, go ahead and take it today.

1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:50.160
 So you see this preference reversal and so that is, that's a model of addiction in the

1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:58.520
 sense that consistently with true addiction, I would argue, you see this competition between

1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:01.800
 molar and molecular utility.

1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:09.360
 It's like intrapersonal, like within the person competing agents, someone sometimes has control

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:16.080
 of the bus that wants to do what's good for you in the short term and someone at other

1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:20.560
 times is in control of driving the bus and they want to do what's good for you in the

1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:22.600
 long term.

1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:28.320
 So you tell the, you're trying to quit and you see a doctor, you see your 12 step therapist

1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:35.600
 and say, God, I know this stuff is killing me, I'm really, I'm on the path, I'm done.

1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:39.280
 And that's when you're kind of in their office or wherever you're not, it's not around you.

1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:43.000
 And then later on that day, your buddy says that, hey, man, I just scored, I've got it

1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:44.000
 right here.

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:45.000
 Do you want it?

1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:46.000
 And that reward is right in front of you.

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:49.280
 That's like bringing those two choices right in front of you and it's like, hell yeah,

1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:50.280
 I want to use.

1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:51.280
 Yes.

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:54.840
 And then you can go through that cycle for like years of the person telling themselves,

1:05:54.840 --> 1:06:00.280
 I want to quit, but then other times that same person is saying, I don't want to, you

1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:03.200
 know, functionally they're saying I don't want to because they're saying, yeah, like,

1:06:03.200 --> 1:06:04.280
 yeah, give me some.

1:06:04.280 --> 1:06:07.400
 So in the moment, it's very difficult to quit.

1:06:07.400 --> 1:06:11.160
 And this isn't just something, this is something that has, has huge clinical ramifications with

1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:13.720
 addiction, but it's like all humans do it.

1:06:13.720 --> 1:06:17.400
 Anyone who's had hit the snooze alarm in the morning, like the night before they realize,

1:06:17.400 --> 1:06:19.760
 oh, I got to get up extra early tomorrow.

1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:21.400
 That's what's ultimately better for me.

1:06:21.400 --> 1:06:29.320
 So I'm going to set the alarm for, you know, five AM and they, they, it goes off at five

1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:34.880
 AM, you know, and then it's, so now those two consequences have come sooner and it's

1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:35.880
 like, what the hell?

1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:39.400
 And they hit the snooze alarm and some is not just once, but then five minutes later

1:06:39.400 --> 1:06:44.400
 and five minutes later, you know, and so, and it's why it's easier to exert exercise

1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:48.840
 self control at the grocery store compared to in your fridge.

1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:57.080
 Like if that snack is like 30 seconds away in your fridge, you're going to more likely

1:06:57.080 --> 1:07:01.120
 yield to temptation than if it is further away.

1:07:01.120 --> 1:07:08.480
 So then to take a step back to something you brought up earlier, the inelasticity of pricing.

1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:17.200
 Is it from a perspective of the dealers, whether we're talking about cigarettes or maybe venturing

1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:23.600
 slightly into the illegal realm, you know, of people who sell drugs illegally, they also

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:29.280
 have an economics to them that they said prices and all of those kinds of things.

1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:34.880
 Does addiction allow you to mess with the nature of pricing?

1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:41.560
 Like, so I kind of assume that you meant that there's a correlation between things you're

1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:47.040
 addicted to and the inelasticity of the price so you can jack up the price.

1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:48.040
 Right.

1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:53.680
 Is there something interesting to be said both for legal drugs and illegal drugs about

1:07:53.680 --> 1:08:03.520
 the kind of price games you can play because the consumers of the product are addicted?

1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:04.520
 Right.

1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:09.400
 I mean, I think you just described it, yeah, you can jack up the price and, you know, some

1:08:09.400 --> 1:08:13.560
 people are going to drop off, but the people, you know, and it's not dichotomous because

1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:17.400
 you could just consume less, but some people are going to consume less and the people that

1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:22.360
 are most addicted are going to keep, you know, I mean, you see this, they're going to keep

1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:23.360
 purchasing.

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:28.120
 So you see this with cigarettes and so it's interesting when you interface this with policy,

1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:31.960
 like in one respect, heavily taxing cigarettes is a good thing.

1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:37.880
 We know it keeps, you know, adolescents particularly price sensitive, so you definitely, people

1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:42.200
 smoke less and especially kids smoke less when you keep cigarette prices high and you

1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:44.400
 tax the hell out of them.

1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:49.880
 But one of the downsides, you've got to balance and keep in mind is that you disproportionately

1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:55.080
 have working class, poor people, and then you get into a point where someone's spending,

1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:56.760
 you know, quarter of their paycheck on cigarettes.

1:08:56.760 --> 1:09:01.120
 So they're going to smoke no matter what and basically because they're addicted, they're

1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:06.040
 going to smoke no matter what and usually, yeah, you're taxing their existence.

1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:07.040
 Right.

1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:10.640
 So you're making it worse for, if they don't, if they are completely inelastic, you're

1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:16.120
 actually making that person's life worse because we know that by interfering with the amount

1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:22.080
 of money they have, you're interfering with the other pro social, the potential competitors

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:27.360
 to smoking, you know, and we know that when someone's in more impoverished environments

1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:32.960
 and they have less sort of non drug alternatives, you know, the more likely they're going to

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:34.200
 stay addicted.

1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:35.840
 So, you know.

1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:41.960
 Is there data, this is interesting from a scientific perspective of those same kind

1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:51.000
 of games in illegal drugs, sort of, because that's where most drug, I was, I mean, I don't

1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:56.480
 know, maybe you can correct me, but it seems like most drugs are currently illegal.

1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:01.880
 And so, but they're still in economics to them, obviously, as the drug war and so on.

1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:08.480
 Is there data on the setting of prices or like, how good are the business people running

1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:11.360
 the selling of drugs that are illegal?

1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:15.760
 Are they all the same kind of rules apply from a behavioral economics perspective?

1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:16.760
 I think so.

1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:20.480
 I mean, they're basically, whether they're crunching the numbers or not, they're basically

1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:26.080
 sensitive to that demand curve and they're doing the same thing that businesses do in

1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:32.520
 a legal market and, you know, you want to sell as much of a product to get as much money.

1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:36.600
 You're looking more at the total income, so if you jack the price a little bit, you're

1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:40.640
 going to get some reduction in consumption, but it may be that the total amount of money

1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:46.360
 that you rake in is going to be more than, it's going to overcompensate for that.

1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:49.600
 So you're willing to take, okay, I'm going to lose 10% of my customers, but I'm getting

1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:54.880
 more than enough to compensate from that, from the extra money from the people who still

1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:55.880
 are buying.

1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:59.160
 I think they're more, you know, and especially when we get to the lower, I wouldn't be surprised

1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:04.400
 if people are crunching those numbers and looking at demand curves, maybe at the really

1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:07.840
 high levels of the, you know, up the chain with the cartels and whatnot.

1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:08.840
 I don't know.

1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:13.600
 That wouldn't surprise me at all, but I think it's probably more implicit at the lower levels

1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:20.480
 where something he brought up, drug policy, I will say that for years now, it's been this

1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:29.840
 kind of unquestioned goal by, for example, the drug czar's office in the U.S. to make

1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:35.720
 the price of illegal drugs as high as possible without this kind of nuanced approach that,

1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:42.160
 yeah, if you make, you know, for some people, if you make the price so high, you're actually

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:43.560
 making things worse.

1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:48.760
 I mean, I'm all about reducing the problems associated with drugs and drug addictions,

1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:54.560
 and part of that is that are more direct consequences of those drugs themselves, but a whole lot

1:11:54.560 --> 1:12:00.560
 is what you get from indirectly, and, you know, sort of the, both for the individual

1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:05.440
 and for society, so like making it a poor person who doesn't have enough money for their

1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:11.040
 kids, making them even poorer, so now you've made their children's future worse because

1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:15.240
 they're growing up in deeper poverty because you've essentially levied a tax onto this

1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:22.200
 person who's heavily addicted, but then at the societal level, you know, so everything

1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:27.240
 we know about the drug war in terms of the heavy criminalization and filling up prisons

1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:33.040
 and reducing employment and educational opportunities, which in the big picture, we know are the

1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:39.000
 things that in a free market compete against some of the worst problems of addiction is

1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:43.200
 actually having educational and employment opportunities, but when you give someone a

1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:48.680
 felony, for example, you're pretty much guaranteeing they're never going to go very high on the

1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:56.440
 economic ladder, and so you're making drugs a better reward for that person's future.

1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:03.280
 So this is a quick step into the policy realm, and I think for both you and I, I'm not sure

1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:10.520
 you can correct me, but I'm more comfortable into studying the effects of drugs on the

1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:14.960
 human behavior and human psychology versus like policies, seems like a whole giant mess,

1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:23.160
 but you know, there's some libertarian candidates for president and just libertarian thinkers

1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:31.080
 that had a nice thought experiment of possibly legalizing, I've spoken about possibly legalizing

1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:39.720
 basically all drugs in your intuition, do you think a world where all drugs are legal

1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:45.280
 is a safer world or a less safe world for the users of those drugs?

1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:47.960
 It really depends on what we mean by legalization.

1:13:47.960 --> 1:13:52.280
 So this is one of my beefs with this, you know, how these things are talked about.

1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:59.480
 I mean, we have very few completely laissez faire, you know, legal drugs.

1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:02.440
 So even caffeine is one of the few examples.

1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:05.840
 So for example, caffeine and tea and coffee is in that realm.

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:09.240
 Like there's no limits, no one's testing, there's no laws, regulation at any level

1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:12.120
 of how much caffeine you're allowed to buy or how much in a product.

1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:18.040
 But even like with this Starbucks like Nitro, there are rules with soda and with canned products,

1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:19.880
 you can only put so much in there.

1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:20.880
 Yeah.

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:25.000
 So this is FDA regulated and it's kind of weird because there's a limit to sodas that's

1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.560
 not there for energy drinks and other things.

1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:31.920
 But you know, so even caffeine, it depends on what product we're talking about.

1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:35.400
 If you're like no dose and other caffeine products over the counter, like you can't

1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:36.920
 just put 800 milligrams in there.

1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:39.520
 The pills are like one or 200 milligrams.

1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:42.080
 And so it's FDA regulated as an overcounter drug.

1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:46.880
 Some of the most dangerous drugs in society, I would say arguably one of the most dangerous

1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:51.200
 classes of drugs is the volatile anesthetics, huffing, people huffing gasoline and, you

1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:58.680
 know, airplane glue, toluene, whatnot, um, severely damaging to the nervous system.

1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:00.320
 Pretty much legal.

1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:03.680
 But there's some regulation in the sense that there's a warning label, like it's illegal

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:09.520
 to do it for, not that it nested people, they're busting people for this, but you know, it's

1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:14.440
 against federal law to use this in a way other than intended type of the basics, like, yeah,

1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:20.480
 don't huff this, you know, um, your paint thinner, whatnot, at least keeps people from

1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:24.600
 selling it for that, like no, because they're going to, they're going to go after that person.

1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:27.200
 They're not going to be able to find the 12 year old who's huffing.

1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:31.080
 So anyway, just as some extreme examples at the end.

1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:36.480
 And then, you know, even the, the so called illegal, like schedule one drug, psilocybin,

1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:41.400
 we do plenty in, in, um, in terms of schedule two, which is ironically less restricted than

1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:45.800
 psilocybin, but methamphetamine and cocaine, I've done human research with my research

1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:47.080
 has been legal.

1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:49.640
 So they're scheduled compounds, but they're not completely illegal.

1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:55.680
 Like you can do research with them with the appropriate licensees and, um, uh, approval.

1:15:55.680 --> 1:15:59.240
 So there really is no such thing in like alcohol.

1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:03.680
 Well, it's illegal if you're 12 years old or 18 years old or 20 years old.

1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:06.680
 And for anyone, it's illegal to, to be drinking it while you're driving.

1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:09.120
 So there's always a nuance.

1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:10.120
 There's rules, right?

1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:11.120
 It's not dichotomy.

1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:15.760
 And I actually should admit, it's been on my to do list for a while to buy in Massachusetts

1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:19.360
 some like edible or buy weed legally.

1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:27.520
 I, um, yeah, haven't done that in Massachusetts, put it this way, and I, I wonder what that

1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:31.120
 experience is like, cause I get, I think it's fully legal in Massachusetts.

1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:37.480
 And so I wonder what legal drugs look like to me, you know, I grew up with even weed

1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:43.040
 being like, you know, not, it's like this forbidden thing, you know, not, not forbidden,

1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:44.040
 but it's illegal.

1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:49.400
 You know, most people, of course I never partook, but, uh, most people I knew would, uh, attain

1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:50.880
 it illegally.

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:57.040
 And so that big switch that's been happening across the country, there's like federal stuff

1:16:57.040 --> 1:17:01.680
 going on to make a marijuana legal federal, I'm, I'm half paying attention.

1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:02.680
 There's some movement there.

1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:06.160
 I mean, the house passed a bill that's not going to be passed by the, by the Senate.

1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:08.160
 But yeah, it's, it's a progress.

1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:10.320
 There's, there's clearly a change in, right.

1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:11.440
 It's moving in a trend.

1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:15.400
 So that's the example of a drug that used to be illegal and is now becoming more and

1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:16.640
 more and more legal.

1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:23.160
 Um, so I wonder what like, uh, cocaine being legal looks like, right?

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:26.160
 What a society with cocaine being legal looks like.

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:32.800
 The rules around it, the, uh, you know, the processes in which you can consume it in a

1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:40.320
 safer way and be more educated about its consequences, be able to control dose and like purity much

1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:45.880
 better, be able to get help for overdose, I don't know, all those kinds of things.

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:55.120
 I, it does in a utopian sense feel like legalizing drugs at least should be talked about and

1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:59.520
 considered versus, uh, keeping them in the dark.

1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:00.760
 I agree.

1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:10.280
 But yeah, so that in your sense, it's possible that in 50 years, uh, we legalize all drugs

1:18:10.280 --> 1:18:13.160
 and, uh, it makes for a better world.

1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:17.520
 The way I like to talk about it is that I would say that we, it's possible and it would

1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:21.160
 probably be a good thing if we regulate all drugs.

1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:23.960
 How would you regulate, uh, like cocaine, for example?

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:25.720
 Is there, is there ideas there?

1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:30.080
 So yeah, and you were already, you know, goings, you know, where I was going with that kind

1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:34.480
 of first I described how there's always a new ones and even like the cannabis in Massachusetts,

1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:35.480
 federally illegal.

1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:39.760
 So for example, if I was like, and I, you know, colleagues that do cannabis research

1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:43.160
 where they get people high in the lab, like you're a federal funded researcher within

1:18:43.160 --> 1:18:46.840
 NIH funds, you can't get that, that stuff from the dispensary because it's, you're breaking

1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:51.080
 a federal law, even though the feds don't have the resources to go after, they don't

1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:55.320
 want the controversy at this point to go after the individual users or even the, the sellers

1:18:55.320 --> 1:18:56.320
 in those legal states.

1:18:56.320 --> 1:18:59.640
 So there's always this nuance, but it's, it's about right, the right regulation.

1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:04.440
 So I think we already know enough that, for example, like I think safe injection sites

1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:07.080
 for hard drugs, um, makes a lot of sense.

1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:13.200
 Like I wouldn't want, um, heroin and cocaine at the convenience stores.

1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:16.040
 And I don't think, maybe there's some extreme libertarians that want that.

1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:21.440
 I think even the folks that identify as libertarians, probably most of them don't, well, I don't

1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:26.920
 know, like not all of them want that, you know, um, I think, you know, that as a form

1:19:26.920 --> 1:19:31.920
 of regulation, like, look, if you're using these hard drugs on a, on a regular basis,

1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:35.400
 you're putting yourself at risk for lethal overdose, you're putting yourself at risk

1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:42.480
 for catching, um, HIV and, and hepatitis, um, if you're going to do it, if you're doing

1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:47.960
 it anyway, come to this place where at least you're not like, you know, you're like pulling

1:19:47.960 --> 1:19:52.200
 the, the, the water out of like, you know, the puddle on the side of the street.

1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:53.200
 Yeah.

1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:57.200
 So it's done by professionals and those professionals are able to educate you also.

1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:04.720
 So like a 711 clerk may not be both capable of helping you to, uh, to inject the drug

1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:09.200
 properly, but also it won't be equipped to educate you at, but the negative consequences

1:20:09.200 --> 1:20:10.200
 on those kinds of things.

1:20:10.200 --> 1:20:14.880
 That's a huge part of it, the education, but then I think with the opioids, like the big

1:20:14.880 --> 1:20:21.480
 part of it is just like with naloxone, which is an antagonist, it goes into the, um, the

1:20:21.480 --> 1:20:22.480
 receptor.

1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:23.480
 It's called Narcan.

1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:27.120
 That's the trade name, but it's what they revive people on an opioid overdose.

1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:29.320
 That's almost completely effective.

1:20:29.320 --> 1:20:33.440
 Like if there's a medical professional there and someone's ODing on an opioid, they're

1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:35.440
 virtually guaranteed to live.

1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:40.840
 Like that's remarkable that if a hundred percent at the opioid crisis, you know, if all of

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:45.360
 those people right now that are dying, we're doing that in the presence of a medical professional,

1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:50.080
 like even just like a nurse with Narcan, there'd be basic almost no deaths.

1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:53.160
 There's always some exceptions, but you know, almost no deaths.

1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:54.480
 Like that's staggering to me.

1:20:54.480 --> 1:21:00.280
 So the idea that people are doing this, you know, that we could have that level of positive

1:21:00.280 --> 1:21:02.560
 effect without encouraging the drug.

1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:06.400
 And this is where like you get into this like terrain of like sending the wrong message

1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:09.120
 and it's like, no, you can do that.

1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:12.120
 You can say like, we're not encouraging this.

1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:17.440
 In fact, probably one of the greatest advertisements for not getting hooked on heroin is like visiting

1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:19.920
 a methadone clinic, visiting a safe injection site.

1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:25.680
 Like, like this is not like an advertisement for getting hooked on this drug, but knowing

1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:26.680
 that we can save people.

1:21:26.680 --> 1:21:31.120
 Now you have a landscape here because a lot of times it's just like supervised injection,

1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:34.720
 but you bring your own stuff, you know, you bring your own heroin, which could still be

1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:40.600
 you know, dirty and filled with fentanyl and fentanyl derivatives, which because of the

1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:45.480
 incredible potency and the more difficulty measuring it, and some differences at the

1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:50.480
 receptor, like you may be more likely, you are more likely on average to lethally overdose

1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:51.480
 on it.

1:21:51.480 --> 1:21:58.080
 You know, so you could the level that's been more explored in Switzerland is in some places

1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:03.240
 is you actually provide the drug itself and you supervise the injection.

1:22:03.240 --> 1:22:04.240
 So I don't see...

1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:05.240
 Do you like that idea?

1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:06.240
 Yeah.

1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:10.080
 The public health data are completely on the side of there's really no credible evidence

1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:11.080
 to this.

1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:14.560
 If we allow that, we're sending the wrong message and everyone's going to be, I mean, I'm not

1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:18.800
 showing up like, you know, and it's different by drug like, yeah, you, you legalize, you

1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:21.720
 set up cannabis shops and some people are going to say, so you come and go there.

1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:25.160
 I don't think a whole lot of people are going to go to one of these places and say, I'm

1:22:25.160 --> 1:22:29.480
 going to shoot up heroin for the first time because, and even if like, you know, it's

1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:34.160
 a country of 300 million people, like even if someone does that, you have to compare

1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:40.720
 this to the everyday people are dying from opioid overdoses, like people's kids, people's

1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:43.680
 uncles, people's like, these are real lives that are being shattered.

1:22:43.680 --> 1:22:45.400
 So you just look at that.

1:22:45.400 --> 1:22:49.720
 And then the other thing, and I know this from having done residential, even like non

1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:54.080
 treatment research where we just have a cocaine user or something, stay on our inpatient word

1:22:54.080 --> 1:22:58.160
 for a month and you really get to know them and sometimes you see, like oftentimes that's

1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:02.920
 the first time this person has had a discussion with a medical professional, any type of professional

1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:07.320
 in their entire life around their drug use, even if they're not looking to quit.

1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:12.160
 And it's like, I, you know, you could imagine that in the safe injection settings where

1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:16.680
 it's like, it might be a year into treatment and they're like, you know, doc, I know you're

1:23:16.680 --> 1:23:17.680
 not the cops.

1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:18.680
 Like you really care for me.

1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:21.080
 Like, I think I'm ready to try that methadone thing.

1:23:21.080 --> 1:23:22.880
 I think I'm really, I think I want to be done.

1:23:22.880 --> 1:23:24.880
 I want to be done.

1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:29.080
 Yeah, they get to trust the people and, and realize that they're, they're there because

1:23:29.080 --> 1:23:33.560
 they truly like, they have a compassion, a love for, for, for this community, like as

1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:36.720
 human beings and they don't want people to die.

1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:41.000
 And you get real human connections and that, and again, like those are the conditions where

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.080
 people are going to ultimately seek treatment.

1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:46.920
 And not everyone always will, but you're, you're going to get that.

1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:50.360
 And then you're, you know, you're going to get people like looking into treatment options.

1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:53.760
 You know, maybe it's years into, to the treatment.

1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:57.800
 So it's like, they're just all of these indirect benefits that I think at that level, I don't

1:23:57.800 --> 1:24:02.520
 know if you'd call that legalizing, you know, I think again, right, at least well regulated.

1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:03.520
 Right.

1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:04.520
 Whatever that word is.

1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:05.520
 Yeah.

1:24:05.520 --> 1:24:07.880
 Well regulated, but out in the open.

1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:08.880
 Right.

1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:13.360
 Minimizing as many harms as we can, while not encouraging.

1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:16.800
 I mean, we don't encourage people to drink all the, I mean, people die every year from

1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:17.800
 caffeine overdose.

1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:20.200
 Like, you know, and there's different ways to like, you know, like, you know, like,

1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:24.720
 just by allowing something doesn't mean we're sending the message that, you know, by saying

1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:30.400
 we're not going to give you a felony, which is actually often the, the, the, the, the

1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:32.120
 penalty for, for psychedelics.

1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:37.200
 I just actually testified for the judiciary committee, the, the Senate, the assembly in,

1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:38.760
 in New Jersey.

1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:44.520
 And just to move psilocybin from a felony to misdemeanor, they use different language

1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:45.520
 in New Jersey.

1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:48.600
 It's weird, but like the equivalent of felony and misdemeanor, and that was like two people

1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:53.840
 didn't vote for that on the, on this committee, because it was might, one of them said it

1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:57.840
 might be sending the wrong message and it's like a felony.

1:24:57.840 --> 1:24:59.160
 I mean, there's real harms.

1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:01.640
 Like that's the scarlet letter the rest of your life.

1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:04.280
 You're stuck at the lower ends of the employment ladder.

1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:08.080
 You're not going to get, you know, loans for education, all of this, maybe because of a

1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:11.560
 stupid mistake you made once as a 19 year old.

1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:15.080
 Doing something that like, you know, a presidential candidate could have done and admitted to

1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:16.440
 and had no problem.

1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:25.680
 You know, yeah, what drug is the most addictive, the most dangerous in your view?

1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:34.400
 Not maybe like, not technically like specifically which drug, but more like in our society today.

1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:36.000
 What is a highly problematic drug?

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:41.800
 We talked about psychedelics not being that addictive on the other flip side of that.

1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:43.200
 You mentioned cocaine.

1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:45.240
 Is that, is that the top one?

1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:48.080
 Is there something else that's a concern to you?

1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:49.080
 It depends.

1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:50.080
 And you've already alluded to this nuance.

1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:51.400
 It depends on how you define it.

1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:58.320
 If we're talking about on the ground today in, you know, modern society, I'd say nicotine

1:25:58.320 --> 1:25:59.320
 tobacco.

1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:00.320
 Oh, interesting.

1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:08.320
 I mean, in terms of mortality, it kills, it kills far more than any other drug known

1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:13.360
 to humankind four times more than alcohol, like a half million deaths in the US every

1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:18.680
 year and about five to six million worldwide due to tobacco.

1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:21.680
 That's four times more in the US than alcohol.

1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:27.680
 And if you graph all of the drugs, legal and illegal, like, you know, put all of the illegal

1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:33.600
 drugs in like one category on that figure and you put alcohol and tobacco on that figure,

1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:39.960
 all the illegal drugs combined, barely, they're a barely visible blip to this incredible, like

1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:44.520
 it's, there's no, even all of the opioid epidemic rolled up along with cocaine and everything

1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:47.200
 else in the meth barely shows up compared to tobacco.

1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:52.960
 That's one of those uncomfortable truths that I don't know what to do with.

1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:59.240
 It's like, where everybody's freaking out about coronavirus, right?

1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:00.240
 And nobody's.

1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:01.240
 The relative.

1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:02.240
 It's, it's all relative.

1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:07.360
 If you look at the relative thing, it's like, well, why aren't we freaking out about now

1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:12.520
 cigarettes, which, which we are increasingly so over the historically speaking, right?

1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:13.520
 Right.

1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:14.880
 It's like terrorism versus swimming pools.

1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:20.000
 I remember that being back in the, after the war on terrorists started, it's like, yeah,

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:21.480
 there's not even comparison.

1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:22.480
 Okay.

1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:25.040
 So, you know, that's a little sobering truth there.

1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:30.400
 Cause I was thinking like cocaine, I was thinking about all of these hard drugs, but the reality

1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:33.400
 is relatively nicotine is the, is the big one.

1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:38.080
 When you didn't ask about mortality or deaths, you asked about addiction, but that's, that

1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:40.560
 really is hard to, hard to evaluate.

1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:45.120
 It gets into those nuances I spoke of before about there's not a unit dimensional way to

1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:46.120
 measure reinforcement.

1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:50.920
 It kind of depends on the situation and, and what measure we're looking at.

1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:57.600
 But, you know, more people have access to tobacco and I'm not, I'm not advocating that we make

1:27:57.600 --> 1:27:58.600
 it an illegal drug.

1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:01.720
 I think that would, it was a hard, would be a horrible mistake, although there is a very

1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:09.080
 credible push to, to mandate the reduction of nicotine in cigarettes, which I have most

1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:10.840
 scientists that study it are for it.

1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:15.760
 I think there's some real dangers there because I see that in the broader history of drug

1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:16.760
 use.

1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:20.360
 It's like, when has drug prohibition worked broadly speaking?

1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:26.400
 And, and it's, it's, to me, that would, that, that path would only make sense in very good

1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:32.240
 conjunction with eCigarettes, which once they're fully regulated can be a safer, not safe, but

1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:34.320
 much safer alternative.

1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:39.520
 And if we don't, if we tax the hell out of eCigarettes and ban every attractive feature

1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:46.000
 like, like flavors and everything, then that's going to push people to a black market if

1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:47.960
 they can't get the real thing from real cigarettes.

1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:51.680
 Some people will just quit straight out, but I think with the regulators and what a lot

1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:58.840
 of scientists that study tobacco like myself, it's a big part still of what I study, they're

1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:03.800
 not used to thinking about the, like tobacco really as a, as a drug, largely speaking in

1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:07.640
 terms of, you know, for example, the history of prohibition.

1:29:07.640 --> 1:29:11.760
 And I think of like, we already know there's an illicit market, a black market for tobacco

1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:16.680
 to get around, you know, taxes, I mean, and for selling even loose cigarettes.

1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:20.800
 That's what initially caused in Staten Island, the police to approach, was it Eric Garland

1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:23.280
 who is selling loose cigarettes and he got choked out.

1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:27.320
 I mean, the thing that caused that police contact was he was selling, well, I think

1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:31.280
 reported to sell individual cigarettes for like, you know, you could sell them for quarter,

1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:32.280
 happens in Baltimore.

1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:34.520
 And it's like, that's technically illegal.

1:29:34.520 --> 1:29:41.080
 But you know, are you not going to have massive boats of, you know, supplies coming over from

1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:47.720
 China and elsewhere of real deal cigarettes if you ban, you know, the sale of nicotine?

1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:52.760
 Like it's obviously going to happen and you have to weigh that against, you know, you're

1:29:52.760 --> 1:29:55.560
 going to create a black market to one size or another.

1:29:55.560 --> 1:29:59.600
 And your intuition that really hasn't worked throughout the history when we've tried it.

1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:00.600
 Right.

1:30:00.600 --> 1:30:05.280
 But I see a potential path forward, but only if it's well, if it's not in conjunction with

1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:06.280
 eCigarettes.

1:30:06.280 --> 1:30:11.200
 If there's a clear alternative that's a positive alternative that it kind of stares the population

1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:14.360
 that, right, towards an alternative.

1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:15.360
 Yeah.

1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:19.440
 The unique thing that could be taken advantage of here is nicotine is by and large not what

1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:20.940
 causes the harm.

1:30:20.940 --> 1:30:28.040
 It's the aromatic hydrocarbons, it's the carcinogens and tobacco, it's burning tobacco smoke.

1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:29.600
 It's not the nicotine.

1:30:29.600 --> 1:30:36.520
 So that it's not like alcohol prohibition where like, you know, you couldn't create

1:30:36.520 --> 1:30:39.840
 the adules, the near beer is not going to have the alcohol.

1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:46.120
 And so people like, here you do have the possibility of giving another medium, the ability to

1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:51.400
 deliver the drug, which still aren't, to a lot of people, isn't preferred to the tobacco,

1:30:51.400 --> 1:30:55.640
 but nonetheless, again, if you over regulate those and make them less attractive, like if

1:30:55.640 --> 1:30:59.880
 you aren't thoughtful about the nicotine limits and thoughtful about whether you're

1:30:59.880 --> 1:31:04.840
 allowing flavors and everything, and if you over tax them, you're actually decreasing

1:31:04.840 --> 1:31:08.720
 the ability to compete with the more dangerous product.

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:12.360
 So I feel that like there is a potential path forward, but I don't have a lot of confidence

1:31:12.360 --> 1:31:17.160
 that that's going to be done in a thoughtful, analytical way.

1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:22.280
 And I'm afraid that it could decrease the increase of black market calls all of the

1:31:22.280 --> 1:31:23.280
 harms.

1:31:23.280 --> 1:31:28.560
 Like every other drug we're moving away from the heavy, from the prohibition models slowly,

1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:34.360
 but the big barge ship is like making a very slow turn and like, okay, we really had a

1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:40.800
 step back and question if we want to with nicotine tobacco, are we moving into that

1:31:40.800 --> 1:31:41.800
 direction?

1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:42.800
 Yeah.

1:31:42.800 --> 1:31:43.800
 Like big picture.

1:31:43.800 --> 1:31:46.400
 It doesn't quite make sense.

1:31:46.400 --> 1:31:56.920
 You've done a study on cocaine and sexual decision making, can you explain the findings?

1:31:56.920 --> 1:32:08.440
 I mean, in a broad sense, how do you do a study that involves cocaine and the other,

1:32:08.440 --> 1:32:13.200
 how do you do a study involving this sexual decision making?

1:32:13.200 --> 1:32:16.560
 And then how do you do a study that combines both?

1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:17.560
 Yeah.

1:32:17.560 --> 1:32:18.560
 Sex and drugs too.

1:32:18.560 --> 1:32:19.560
 I'm just missing the rock and roll.

1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:20.560
 The rock and roll.

1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:21.560
 The two controversial.

1:32:21.560 --> 1:32:25.440
 Rock and roll isn't very controversial anymore, but yeah, so the cocaine, you know, lots of

1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:26.440
 hoops to drum through.

1:32:26.440 --> 1:32:28.440
 You got to have a lot of medical support.

1:32:28.440 --> 1:32:33.200
 You got to be at a basically an institution, a research unit like I'm at that has a long

1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:41.000
 history and the ability to do that and get ethics approval, get FDA approval, but it's

1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:42.000
 possible.

1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:44.720
 And whenever you're dealing with something like cocaine, you would never want to give

1:32:44.720 --> 1:32:50.720
 that to someone who hasn't already used cocaine and you want to make sure you're not giving

1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:53.480
 it to someone who is an active user who wants to quit.

1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:58.640
 So the idea is like, okay, if you're using this type of drug anyway and you're really

1:32:58.640 --> 1:33:04.360
 sure you're not looking to quit, hey, use a couple of times in the lab with us so we

1:33:04.360 --> 1:33:06.760
 can at least learn something.

1:33:06.760 --> 1:33:12.120
 And part of what we learn is maybe to help people not use and reduce the harms of cocaine.

1:33:12.120 --> 1:33:14.440
 So there's hoops to jump through.

1:33:14.440 --> 1:33:18.840
 With the sexual decision making, I looked at the main thing I looked at was this model

1:33:18.840 --> 1:33:24.400
 of I applied delayed discounting to what we talked about earlier than now versus later

1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:27.280
 that kind of decision making that goes along with addiction.

1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:33.080
 I applied that to condom use decisions and I've done probably published about 20 or so

1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:35.840
 papers with this and different drugs and...

1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:40.280
 So the primary metric is whether you do or don't use a condom?

1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:41.280
 Right.

1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:42.280
 All hypothetical...

1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:46.880
 And so this is using hypothetical decision making, but I've published some studies looking

1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:53.840
 at showing a tight correspondence to self reported in correlational studies to self reported

1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:54.840
 behavior.

1:33:54.840 --> 1:34:00.000
 So this is like, how do you do a questionnaire kind of thing?

1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:01.000
 Right.

1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:08.280
 So it's not quite a questionnaire, but it's a behavioral task requiring them to respond

1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:09.280
 to see...

1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:13.560
 You show pictures of a bunch of individuals and it's kind of like one of these fun behavioral

1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:17.640
 like a lot of them you get like numbers are born, but it's like, okay, hot or not, like

1:34:17.640 --> 1:34:20.760
 which of these 60 people would you have a one night stand with?

1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:23.760
 Men, women to pick whatever you like, a little bit of this, a little bit of that, whatever

1:34:23.760 --> 1:34:27.000
 you're into, it's all variety there.

1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.160
 Out of that group, you pick some subsets of people.

1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:32.360
 Who do you think is the one you most want to have sex with the least?

1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:36.680
 He thinks most likely to have an STI or at least likely a sexually transmitted disease

1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:37.960
 by STI.

1:34:37.960 --> 1:34:44.120
 And then you could do certain decision making questions of what I've done is ask, say this

1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:46.640
 person, he'd read a vignette, this person wants to have sex with you, now you've met

1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:53.160
 them, you get a long casual sex scenario, like a one night stand, with a condoms available,

1:34:53.160 --> 1:34:56.320
 just rate your likelihood from one to 100 on this kind of scale.

1:34:56.320 --> 1:34:57.320
 Would you use it?

1:34:57.320 --> 1:34:58.320
 Would you use a condom?

1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:01.560
 But then you can change your scenario to say, okay, now imagine you have to wait five minutes

1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:03.000
 to use a condom.

1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:07.920
 So the choice is now instead of using condom versus not in terms of your likelihood scale,

1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:13.640
 it now it ranges from have sex now without a condom versus on the other end of the scale

1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:16.360
 is wait five minutes to have sex with the condom.

1:35:16.360 --> 1:35:20.440
 So you rate your likelihood of where your behavior would be along that continuum.

1:35:20.440 --> 1:35:22.840
 And then you could say, okay, well, what about an hour?

1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:23.960
 What about three hours?

1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:25.840
 What about, you know, what about 24 hours?

1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:29.320
 It's a misunderstanding.

1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:36.680
 Now without a condom or five minutes later with a condom is in the, so what's supposed

1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:43.280
 to be the preference for the person like is like, there's a lot of factors coming into

1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:44.280
 play, right?

1:35:44.280 --> 1:35:45.280
 Right.

1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:51.640
 Like there's like pleasure, personal preference, and then there's also the safety.

1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:54.880
 Those are two like, are those competing objectives?

1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:55.880
 Right.

1:35:55.880 --> 1:35:58.960
 And so we do get at that through some individual measures.

1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:02.760
 And this task is more of a face valid task where there's a lot underneath the hood.

1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:07.680
 So for most people, sex with the condom is the better reward.

1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:11.960
 But underneath the hood of that is just at the purely physical level, they'd rather have

1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:13.640
 sex with without the condom.

1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:14.640
 It's going to feel better.

1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:15.840
 What do you mean by reward?

1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:22.840
 Like when they calculate their trajectory through life and try to optimize it, then sex with

1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:24.600
 the condom is a good idea?

1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:31.760
 Well, it's really based on, I mean, yeah, yeah, presumably that's the case that there's,

1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:35.720
 but it's measured by like what would really that first question where there is no delay.

1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:38.080
 Most people say they would be at the higher net scale.

1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:41.920
 A lot of times a hundred percent, they would say they would definitely use a condom.

1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:42.920
 Not everybody.

1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:43.920
 And we know that's the case.

1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:49.200
 See, it's like that some people don't like, some people say, yeah, I want to use a condom,

1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:53.960
 but quarter of the time ended up not because I just get lost in the passion of the moment.

1:36:53.960 --> 1:36:58.680
 So for the people, I mean, the only reason that people, so behaviorally speaking, at

1:36:58.680 --> 1:37:02.680
 least for a large number of people in many circumstances, condom use as a reinforcer,

1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:07.240
 just because people do it, like, you know, why are they doing it?

1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:12.480
 They're not because it makes the sex feel better, but because it makes that it allows

1:37:12.480 --> 1:37:16.840
 for at least the same general reward, even if actually, even if it feels a little bit

1:37:16.840 --> 1:37:23.960
 not as good, you know, with the condom, nonetheless, they get most of the benefit without the concurrent,

1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:30.200
 oh my gosh, there's this risk of either unwanted pregnancy or getting HIV or way more likely

1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:37.480
 than HIV, you know, herpes, you know, in general, the words, et cetera, all the lovely ones.

1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:41.160
 And we've actually done research saying, like, where we gauge the probability of these individual

1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:45.120
 different STIs, and it's like, what's the heavy hitter in terms of what people are

1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:49.360
 using to judge, you know, to evaluate whether they're going to use a condom.

1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:52.720
 So that's why the condom use is the delayed thing.

1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:56.440
 The minutes are more, and then, yeah, because that's the preferred.

1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:00.160
 Which would normally be the larger, later reward, like the $10 versus the nine.

1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:04.400
 It's like the $10, which is counterintuitive if you just think about the physical pleasure.

1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:07.240
 So that's a good thing to measure.

1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:12.720
 So condom use is a really good, concrete, quantitative, quantifiable thing that you

1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:17.200
 can use in a study, and then you can add a lot of different elements, like the presence

1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:18.200
 of cocaine and so on.

1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:22.160
 Yeah, you can get people loaded on, like, any number of drugs, like cocaine, alcohol,

1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:25.320
 and methamphetamine are the three that I've done and published on.

1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:26.960
 And it's interesting that...

1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:28.840
 These are fun studies, man.

1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:29.840
 Right.

1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:33.680
 I love to get people loaded in a safe context, and like, but to really...

1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:35.880
 It started like there was some early research in alcohol.

1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:36.880
 Fascinating.

1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:40.440
 I mean, the psychedelics are the most interesting, but it's like all of these drugs are fascinating.

1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:45.200
 The fact that all of these are keys that unlock a certain, like, psychological experience

1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:46.760
 in the head.

1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:51.480
 And so there was this work with alcohol that showed that it didn't affect those monetary

1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:56.360
 delay discounting decisions, you know, $9 now versus $10 later, and then like getting

1:38:56.360 --> 1:38:57.360
 people drunk.

1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:03.000
 And I thought to myself, are you telling me that, you know, getting someone that people

1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:09.000
 being drunk does not cause people, at least sometimes to make, to choose what's good for

1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:13.800
 them in the short term at the expense of what's good for them in the long term?

1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:16.800
 It's like, you know, bullshit, you know, like, we see it, like...

1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:19.400
 But in what context does that happen?

1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:24.960
 So that's something that inspired me to go in this direction of like, aha, risky sexual

1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:27.160
 decisions is something they do when they're drunk.

1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:31.200
 They don't necessarily go home and even though some people have gambling problems and alcohol

1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:35.040
 interacts with that, the most typical thing is not for people to go home, you know, log

1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:40.560
 on and change their allocation and their retirement account or something like that, you know, like...

1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:44.440
 But they're more likely, risky sexual decisions, they're more likely to not wait the five minutes

1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:48.280
 for the condom and instead go no condom now.

1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:49.280
 Right.

1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:54.240
 So we see an effect and we see that and interestingly, we do not see with those different drugs,

1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:57.320
 we don't see an effect if we just look at that zero delay condition.

1:39:57.320 --> 1:39:59.840
 In other words, the condom's right there waiting to be used, would you...

1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:00.840
 How likely are to use it?

1:40:00.840 --> 1:40:01.840
 You don't see it.

1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:05.880
 I mean, people are by and large going to use the condom.

1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:09.800
 So and that's the way most of this research outside of behavioral economics that's just

1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:15.280
 looked at condom use decisions, very little of which has ever actually administered the

1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:17.600
 drugs, which is another unique aspect.

1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:22.120
 But they usually just look at like assuming the condom is there, but this is more using

1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:25.720
 behavioral economics to delve in and model something that and I've done survey research

1:40:25.720 --> 1:40:28.360
 on this, modeling what actually happens.

1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:33.760
 Like you meet someone at a laundry mat, like you weren't planning on like, you know, one

1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:36.760
 thing leads to another, they live around the corner, you know.

1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:43.480
 These things, you know, and like we did one survey with men who have sex with men and

1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:50.160
 found that 25% of them, 24%, about a quarter reported in the last six months that they

1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:56.160
 had unprotected anal intercourse, which is the most risky in terms of sexually transmitted

1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:58.600
 infection.

1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:02.360
 In the last six months, in a situation where they would have used a condom, but they simply

1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:05.120
 didn't use one just because they didn't have one on them.

1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:11.280
 So this to me, it's like, if unless we delve into this and understand this, these suboptimal

1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:14.240
 conditions, we're not going to fully address the problem.

1:41:14.240 --> 1:41:17.040
 There's plenty of people that say, yep, condom use is good.

1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:18.880
 I use it a lot of the time.

1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:21.480
 You know, it's like, where is that failing?

1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:24.600
 And it's under these suboptimal conditions, which in Frank, if you think about it, it's

1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:26.840
 like most of the case.

1:41:26.840 --> 1:41:29.200
 Action is unfolding, things are getting hot and heavy.

1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:31.160
 Someone's like, do you got a condom?

1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:32.160
 No.

1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:37.560
 It's like, do they break the action and take 10 minutes to go to the convenience store

1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:38.760
 or whatever?

1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:39.760
 Maybe everything's closed.

1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:43.200
 Maybe they got to wait till tomorrow.

1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:49.240
 And though there's something to be studied there on the, that just seems like an unfortunate

1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:50.240
 set of circumstances.

1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:59.400
 Like what's the solution to that is, I mean, what's the psychology that needs to be like

1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:01.200
 taken apart there?

1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:03.000
 Because it just seems like that's the way of life.

1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.080
 We don't expect the things that to happen.

1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:11.800
 Are we supposed to expect them better to be like, be self aware enough about our calculations?

1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:22.480
 Or you see the 10 minute detour to a convenience store as a kind of thing that we need to understand

1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:26.520
 how we humans evaluate the cost of that.

1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:31.680
 I think in terms of like how we use this to help people, it's mostly on the environment

1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:34.960
 side rather than on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the

1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:36.240
 those, those interact.

1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:39.600
 So it's like, you know, in one sense, if you're especially, if you're going to be drinking

1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:44.960
 or using another substance that, that is associated with, you know, a stimulant, alcohol and

1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:49.240
 stimulants go along with risky sex, you know, good to be aware that you might make decisions

1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:52.880
 just to tell yourself, you might make a decision that, that is going to, that you wouldn't

1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:54.120
 made in your sober state.

1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:59.080
 And so, hey, throwing a condom in the, in the purse and the, in the pocket, you know,

1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:00.800
 might be, you know, a good idea.

1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:04.440
 I think at the environmental level, just more condom, I mean, it highlights what we know

1:43:04.440 --> 1:43:08.080
 about just making condoms widely available.

1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:14.680
 Something that I'd like to do is like, you know, reinforcing condom use, you know, so,

1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:19.720
 you know, just getting people used to carrying a condom everywhere they go, because it's

1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:24.600
 such a once it's in someone's habit, if they are, say, like a young single person and,

1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:28.440
 you know, it's, you know, they occasionally have unprotected sex, like training those

1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:33.240
 people, like, what if you got a text message, you know, once every few days saying, ah,

1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:38.440
 if you show me a, send back a photo of a condom within a minute, you get a reward of $5.

1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:41.760
 You could shape that up, like that it's a process called contingency management.

1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:44.720
 It's basically just straight up operant reinforcement.

1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:46.920
 You could shape that up with no problem.

1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:52.200
 And, and I mean, those procedures of contingency management, giving people systematic rewards

1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:56.920
 is like, for example, the most powerful way to, to, to reduce cocaine use and addicted

1:43:56.920 --> 1:43:57.920
 people.

1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:05.560
 And, but by saying, if you show me a negative urine for cocaine, I'm going to give you a

1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:06.560
 monetary reward.

1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:10.440
 And like that has huge effects in terms of decreasing cocaine use.

1:44:10.440 --> 1:44:14.440
 If that can be that powerful for something like stopping cocaine use, how powerful for

1:44:14.440 --> 1:44:15.440
 that?

1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:17.240
 Could that be for shaping up just carrying a condom?

1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:23.520
 Because the primary, unlike cocaine use here, we're not saying you can't have the main reward.

1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:27.440
 Like you could still have sex and you can even have sex in the way that you tell yourself

1:44:27.440 --> 1:44:33.960
 you'd rather do it, you know, if the condom is available, you know, so, you know, like,

1:44:33.960 --> 1:44:38.640
 you're not, you know, it's relatively speaking, it's way easier than like not using cocaine.

1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:43.240
 If you like using cocaine, it's just basically getting in the habit of carrying a condom.

1:44:43.240 --> 1:44:45.120
 So that's just one idea of like, what?

1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:49.240
 There could be also the capitalistic solutions of like, there could be a business opportunity

1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:55.800
 for like a door dash for condoms, like, like delivery, I thought about this within five

1:44:55.800 --> 1:44:59.480
 minute delivery of a condom at any location, like Uber for condoms.

1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:03.560
 I've thought about it, not with condoms, but a very similar line of thinking, a line that

1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:08.960
 you're going into in terms of Uber and people getting drunk when they, they into the bar

1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:13.000
 playing to have one or two, they ended up having five or six and it's like, okay, yeah,

1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:17.640
 you could take the cab home, the Uber home, but you've left your car there, it might get

1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:21.640
 towed, you might like, there's also the hassle of just, you know, you want to wake up tomorrow

1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:24.080
 with your hangover and forget about it and move on.

1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:28.000
 Like, and I think a lot of people in their situation and they're like, screw it, I'm

1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:33.120
 going to take the risk, just get it, you know, what if you had an Uber service where two,

1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:43.680
 you know, you have a two, some, a car come out with two drivers and one of them, two sober

1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:49.760
 drivers obviously, and they, and the person they, the one driver drops off the other that

1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:57.560
 then drives you home in their car, in your car, so that you can, I mean, I think a lot

1:45:57.560 --> 1:46:01.840
 of people would pay 50 bucks, it's going to be more than a regular Uber, but it's like,

1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:02.840
 it's going to be done.

1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:08.320
 I got the money, I already spent 60 bucks at the bar tonight, like, just get the damn

1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:12.920
 thing done, tomorrow I'm done with it, my car, I wake up, my car's in front of my house.

1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:16.600
 I think that would be, I think someone could, I'm not going to open that business, so like,

1:46:16.600 --> 1:46:19.880
 if anyone hears this and wants to take off with that, like, I think it could help a lot

1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:20.880
 of people.

1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:21.880
 Yeah, definitely.

1:46:21.880 --> 1:46:27.880
 An Uber itself, I would say, helped a huge amount of people, just making it easy to make

1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:31.560
 the decision of going home while not driving yourself.

1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:35.520
 I read about in Austin where they, I don't know where it's at now, where they outlawed

1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:39.960
 Uber for a while, you know, because of the whole taxi cab union type thing and how just,

1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:45.600
 yeah, there were like hordes of drunk people that were used to Uber that now didn't have

1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:47.440
 a cheap alternative.

1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:54.200
 So just, we didn't exactly mention, you've done a lot of studies in sexual decision making

1:46:54.200 --> 1:46:55.280
 with different drugs.

1:46:55.280 --> 1:47:03.200
 Is there some interesting insights or findings on the difference between the different drugs?

1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:09.720
 So I think you said meth as well, so cocaine, is there some interesting characteristics

1:47:09.720 --> 1:47:14.600
 about decision making that these drugs alter versus like alcohol, all those kinds of things?

1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:19.040
 I think, and there's much more to study with this, but I think the biggie there is that

1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:26.400
 the stimulants, they create risky sex by really increasing the rewarding value of sex.

1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:30.520
 Like if you talk to people that are really, especially that are hooked on stimulants,

1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:36.040
 one of the biggies is like sex on coke or meth is like so much better than sex without.

1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:41.040
 And that's a big part of why they have trouble quitting, because it's so tied to their sex

1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:42.040
 life.

1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:46.920
 I think your decision making is broken, it's just that you, well, you allocate.

1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:49.800
 It's a different aspect of their decision, yeah, on the reward side.

1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:52.480
 I think on the alcohol, it works more through disinhibition.

1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:59.160
 It's like alcohol is really good at reducing the ability of a delayed punisher to have

1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:00.240
 an effect on current behavior.

1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:03.840
 In other words, there's this bad thing that's going to happen tomorrow or a week from now

1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:07.760
 or 20 years from now.

1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:12.440
 Being drunk is a really good way, and you see this in like rats making decisions.

1:48:12.440 --> 1:48:16.720
 A high dose of alcohol makes someone less sensitive to those consequences.

1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:22.000
 So I think that's the lever that's being hit with alcohol, and it's more just increasing

1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:27.000
 the rewarding value of sex by the psychostimulants on that side.

1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:30.240
 We actually found that it, and it was amazing, because hundreds of millions of dollars have

1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:36.080
 been spent by NIH to study the connection between cocaine and HIV.

1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:42.560
 We ran the first study on my grant that actually just gave people cocaine under double blind

1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:48.640
 conditions and showed that when people are on coke, their ratings of sexual desire, even

1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:52.680
 though they're not in a sexual situation, yeah, you showed them some pictures, but they're

1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:53.680
 just saying they're horny.

1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:57.800
 You get subjective ratings of how much sexual desire you're feeling right now.

1:48:57.800 --> 1:49:03.760
 People get horny when they're on stimulants, and a lot of people say duh if they really

1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:04.760
 know these drugs.

1:49:04.760 --> 1:49:10.280
 But that's a rigorous study that's in the lab that shows like, there's a plot, the dose

1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:13.640
 effects of that, the time course of that, yeah, it's not just.

1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:19.920
 Can you please tell me there's a paper with a plot that shows dose versus evaluation of

1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:20.920
 like horniness?

1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:23.680
 Yeah, we didn't say horniness, we said sexual arousal.

1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:24.680
 Sex.

1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:25.680
 Yeah, basically, yeah.

1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:26.680
 There's a plot, I'm going to find this plot.

1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:27.760
 Right, I'll send it to you.

1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:35.200
 There was one headline from some publicity on the work that said, horny cocaine users

1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:37.280
 don't use condoms or something like that.

1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:39.280
 You got to love journalism.

1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:41.560
 I wouldn't have put it that way, but yeah, that's right on.

1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:43.880
 I guess that's what it finds.

1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:48.040
 So you've published a bunch of studies on psychedelics.

1:49:48.040 --> 1:49:56.320
 Is there some especially favorite insightful findings from some of these that you could

1:49:56.320 --> 1:50:02.920
 talk about, maybe favorite studies or just something that pops to mind in terms of both

1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:09.800
 the goals and the major insights gained and maybe the side little curiosities that you

1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:11.480
 discovered along the way?

1:50:11.480 --> 1:50:16.920
 Yeah, I think of the work with using psilocybin to help people quit smoking and we've talked

1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:24.000
 about smoking being such a serious addiction and so that what inspired me to get into that

1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:35.200
 was just having behavioral psychology as my primary lens, this sort of radical empirical

1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:44.160
 basis of, I'm really interested in the mystical experience and all of these reports.

1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:50.440
 Very interested, but at the same time, I'm like, okay, let's get down to some behavior

1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:56.960
 change and something that we can record, like quantitatively verify biologically.

1:50:56.960 --> 1:51:02.320
 To find all kinds of negative behaviors that people practice and see if we can turn those

1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:03.320
 into positive.

1:51:03.320 --> 1:51:07.440
 Right, like really change it, not just people saying, which again is interesting, I'm not

1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:11.480
 dismissing it, but folks that say my life has turned around, I feel this has completely

1:51:11.480 --> 1:51:12.480
 changed me.

1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:14.480
 It's like, yep, that's good.

1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:20.280
 All right, let's see if we can harness that and test that into something that's real

1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:21.280
 behavior change.

1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:22.280
 You know what I mean?

1:51:22.280 --> 1:51:23.280
 It's quantifiable.

1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:26.680
 It's like, okay, you've been smoking for 30 years.

1:51:26.680 --> 1:51:30.920
 That's a real thing and you've tried a dozen times seriously to quit and you haven't been

1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:37.640
 able to long term, okay, and if you quit, we'll ask you and I'll believe you but I don't trust

1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:39.240
 everyone reading the paper to believe you.

1:51:39.240 --> 1:51:42.200
 So we're going to have you pee in a cup and we'll test that and we'll have you blow into

1:51:42.200 --> 1:51:45.600
 this little machine that measures carbon monoxide and we'll test that.

1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:49.280
 So multiple levels of biological verification.

1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:53.520
 Now we're getting, to me, that's where the rubber meets the road in terms of therapeutics.

1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:59.360
 It's like, can we really shift behavior and so much as we talked about my other scientific

1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:02.960
 work outside of psychedelics is about understanding addiction and drug use.

1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:07.320
 So it's like looking at addiction, it's a no brainer and smoking is just a great example.

1:52:07.320 --> 1:52:11.280
 And so back to your question, we've had really high success rates.

1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:17.000
 It rivals anything that's been published in the scientific literature.

1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:21.040
 The caveat is that, you know, that's based on our initial trial of only 15 people but

1:52:21.040 --> 1:52:27.480
 extremely high long term success rates, 80% at six months per foot, smoke free.

1:52:27.480 --> 1:52:31.720
 So can we discuss the details and so first of all, which psychedelic we're talking about

1:52:31.720 --> 1:52:37.320
 and maybe can you talk about the 15 people and how the study ran and what you found?

1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:38.320
 Yeah, yeah.

1:52:38.320 --> 1:52:44.160
 So the drug we're using is psilocybin and we're using moderately high and high doses

1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:46.080
 of psilocybin.

1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:47.920
 And I should say this about most of our work.

1:52:47.920 --> 1:52:50.560
 These are not kind of museum level doses.

1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:55.640
 In other words, nothing, even big fans of psychedelics want to take and go to a concert

1:52:55.640 --> 1:52:57.360
 or go to the museum.

1:52:57.360 --> 1:53:01.600
 If someone's a burning man on this type of dose, like they're probably going to want

1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:07.120
 to find their way back to their tent and zip up and hunker down for, you know, not be around

1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:08.120
 strangers.

1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:16.280
 By the way, the delivery method, psilocybin is mushrooms, I guess.

1:53:16.280 --> 1:53:17.280
 What's the usual?

1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:19.200
 Is it edible?

1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:24.520
 Is there some other way, like how is people supposed to think about the correct dosing

1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:25.520
 of these things?

1:53:25.520 --> 1:53:29.640
 Because I've heard that it's hard to dose correctly.

1:53:29.640 --> 1:53:30.640
 That's right.

1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:33.680
 So in our studies, we use the pure compound psilocybin.

1:53:33.680 --> 1:53:37.320
 So it's a single molecule, you know, a bunch of molecules.

1:53:37.320 --> 1:53:42.120
 And we give them a capsule with that in it.

1:53:42.120 --> 1:53:45.000
 And so it's just, you know, a little capsule, they swallow.

1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:51.000
 What people, when psilocybin is used outside of research, it's always in the context of

1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:54.160
 mushrooms because they're so easy to grow.

1:53:54.160 --> 1:53:56.240
 There's no market for synthetic psilocybin.

1:53:56.240 --> 1:54:04.040
 There's no reason for that to pop up.

1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:10.120
 The high dose that we use in research is 30 milligrams body weight adjusted.

1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:16.200
 So if you're a heavier person, it might be like 40 or even 50 milligrams.

1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:20.040
 We have some data that, based on that data, we're actually moving into like getting away

1:54:20.040 --> 1:54:23.680
 from the body weight adjusting of the dose and just giving an absolute dose.

1:54:23.680 --> 1:54:29.440
 It seems like there's no justification for the body weight based dosing, but I digress.

1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:33.080
 Generally 30, 40 milligrams, it's a high dose.

1:54:33.080 --> 1:54:36.200
 And based on average, even though, as you alluded to, there's variability, which gets

1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:41.080
 people into some trouble in terms of mushrooms like psilocybe cubensis, which is the most

1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:45.040
 common for species in the illicit market in the US.

1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:50.560
 This is about equivalent to five dried grams, which is right at about where, right where

1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:55.320
 McKenna and others, they call it a heroic dose.

1:54:55.320 --> 1:54:59.280
 You know, this is not hanging out with your friends, going to the concert again.

1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:05.120
 So this is a real deal dose, even to people that like really, you know, just even to psychonauts.

1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:07.400
 And even we've even had a number of studies.

1:55:07.400 --> 1:55:08.400
 Psychonauts.

1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:09.400
 Yeah, people that, yeah.

1:55:09.400 --> 1:55:10.400
 That's a great term.

1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:16.040
 Cosmonaut, you know, like for psychedelics, going as far out as possible.

1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:21.000
 But even for them, even for those who've flown to space before.

1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:22.000
 Right, right.

1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:23.000
 They're like, holy shit.

1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:27.640
 I didn't know the orbit would be that far out, you know, like, or I escaped the orbit.

1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:31.560
 I was in interplanetary space there.

1:55:31.560 --> 1:55:37.280
 So these folks in the 15 folks in the study, they're not, there's not a question of dose

1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:40.320
 being too low to truly have an impact.

1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:41.320
 Right, right.

1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:44.640
 Very out of hundreds of volunteers over the years, we've only seen a couple of people

1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:50.240
 where there was a mild effect of the, of the 30 milligrams and who knows that person's

1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:55.280
 their serotonin, they, they might have lesser density of serotonin two way receptors or

1:55:55.280 --> 1:55:56.280
 something.

1:55:56.280 --> 1:55:57.280
 We don't know.

1:55:57.280 --> 1:55:58.280
 That's pretty rare.

1:55:58.280 --> 1:56:01.560
 For most people, this is like, like something interesting is going to happen.

1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:02.560
 Put it that way.

1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:09.640
 You know, Joe Rogan, I think that Jamie, his producer is immune to a second.

1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:13.040
 So maybe he's a, he's a good recruit for the state to test.

1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:14.040
 So that's interesting.

1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:19.120
 Now, I'm not the caveat is I'm not encouraging anything illicit, but just theoretically

1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:23.320
 my first question as a far behavioral pharmacologist is like, you know, increase the dose.

1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:24.320
 Increase the dose.

1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:25.320
 You know, like really.

1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:26.320
 Nobody's immune.

1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:30.560
 I'm not telling him Jamie to do that, but like, okay, like, you know, you're taking

1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:33.120
 the same amount that friends might be taking, but yeah.

1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:39.240
 But he was also referring to the psychedelic effects of edible marijuana, which is, is

1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:46.440
 there rules on dosage for, like marijuana?

1:56:46.440 --> 1:56:47.440
 Is there limits?

1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:52.080
 Like what place where it's, this is, this all goes to probably a state by state, right?

1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:56.160
 It is, but most they've gone that direction and states that didn't initially have these

1:56:56.160 --> 1:56:57.920
 rules to have now have them.

1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:02.560
 So it was like, you'll get, I think, you know, five, 10 mill, I think 10, five or 10 milligrams

1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:08.400
 of THC being a common and, and like, and this is an important thing, like where they've

1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:12.600
 moved from not being allowed to say, like have a whole candy bar and have each of the

1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:17.040
 eight or 10 squares in the canner bar being 10 milligrams, but it's like, no, the whole

1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:20.040
 thing because like, you know, somebody gets a candy bar, they're eating the freaking candy

1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:21.040
 bar.

1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:25.480
 And it's like, unless you're a daily cannabis user, if you, if you take, you know, a hundred

1:57:25.480 --> 1:57:30.960
 milligrams, it's like, that's what could lead to a bad trip for someone.

1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:34.040
 And it's like, you know, a lot of these people, it's like, oh, you used to smoke a little

1:57:34.040 --> 1:57:35.200
 weed in college.

1:57:35.200 --> 1:57:39.120
 They might say they're visiting Denver for a business trip and they're like, why not?

1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:40.120
 Let's give it a shot.

1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:42.640
 You know, and they're like, oh, I don't want to smoke something because it's going to,

1:57:42.640 --> 1:57:47.920
 so I'm going to be safer with this edible and consume this massive, you know, but there's

1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:48.920
 huge tolerance.

1:57:48.920 --> 1:57:53.520
 So a regular, like for someone who's smoking weed every day, they might take five milligrams

1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:55.680
 and kind of hardly feel anything.

1:57:55.680 --> 1:58:02.440
 And they may not, they may really need something like 30, 40, 50 milligrams have a strong effect.

1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:08.400
 But yeah, so that's, they've evolved in terms of the rules about like, okay, what constitutes

1:58:08.400 --> 1:58:14.440
 a dose, you know, which is why you see less big candy bars and more, or if it is, you're,

1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:18.000
 if it is a whole candy bar, you're only getting a smaller dose, like 10 milligrams or yeah,

1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:22.400
 because that's where people get in trouble more often with edibles.

1:58:22.400 --> 1:58:26.000
 Yeah, except Joe Ideas, which I've heard.

1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:29.120
 That's definitely something I want to talk to out of the crazy comedians I want to talk

1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:30.120
 to.

1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:36.160
 Anyway, so yeah, 15, the study of the 15 and the dose not being a question.

1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:39.320
 So like, what was the recruitment based on?

1:58:39.320 --> 1:58:43.920
 What was the, like, how did the study get conducted?

1:58:43.920 --> 1:58:44.920
 Yeah.

1:58:44.920 --> 1:58:46.960
 So the recruitment, I really liked this fact.

1:58:46.960 --> 1:58:50.960
 It wasn't people that, you know, largely were, you know, we were honest about what we

1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:56.360
 were studying, but for most people, it was, they were in the category of like, you know,

1:58:56.360 --> 1:59:00.960
 not particularly interested in psychedelics, but more of like, they want to quit smoking.

1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:03.880
 They've tried everything, but the kitchen sink.

1:59:03.880 --> 1:59:08.440
 And this sounds like the kitchen sink, you know, and it's like, well, it's Hopkins.

1:59:08.440 --> 1:59:11.840
 So, you know, thinking that sounds like it's safe enough.

1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:13.000
 So like, what the hell?

1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:14.000
 Let's give it a shot.

1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:20.040
 Like most of them are in that category, which I really, you know, I appreciate because it's

1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:27.800
 more of a test, you know, of, yeah, just like a better model of what if these are approved

1:59:27.800 --> 1:59:34.280
 as medicines, like what you're going to have the average participant, you know, be like.

1:59:34.280 --> 1:59:41.320
 And so the therapy involves a good amount of non psilocybin sessions of preparatory sessions,

1:59:41.320 --> 1:59:45.440
 like eight hours of getting to know the person, like the two people who are going to be their

1:59:45.440 --> 1:59:51.680
 guides or the person in the room with them during the experience, having these discussions

1:59:51.680 --> 1:59:55.200
 with them where you're both kind of rapport building, just kind of discussing their life,

1:59:55.200 --> 1:59:56.880
 getting to know them.

1:59:56.880 --> 2:00:01.720
 But then also telling them, preparing them about the psilocybin experience, so it could

2:00:01.720 --> 2:00:06.120
 be scary in this sense, but here's how to handle it, trust, let go be open.

2:00:06.120 --> 2:00:10.960
 And also during that preparation time, preparing them to quit smoking, using really standard

2:00:10.960 --> 2:00:15.880
 bread and butter techniques that can all fall under the label typically of the cognitive

2:00:15.880 --> 2:00:21.360
 behavioral therapy, just stuff like before you quit, we assign a target quit date ahead

2:00:21.360 --> 2:00:25.160
 of time, you're not just quitting on the fly.

2:00:25.160 --> 2:00:28.280
 And that happens to be the target quit date in our study was the day that where they got

2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:32.640
 the first psilocybin dose, but doing things like keeping a smoking diary like, okay, during

2:00:32.640 --> 2:00:36.840
 the three weeks until you quit, every time you smoke a cigarette, just like jot down

2:00:36.840 --> 2:00:40.280
 what you're doing, what you're feeling, what situation, that type of thing, and then having

2:00:40.280 --> 2:00:41.640
 some discussion around that.

2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:45.920
 And then going over the pluses and minuses in their life that smoking kind of comes with,

2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:47.960
 being honest about the, this is what it does for me.

2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:48.960
 This is why I like it.

2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:50.600
 This is why I don't like it.

2:00:50.600 --> 2:00:54.800
 Preparing for like, what if you do slip, how to handle it, like don't dwell on guilt

2:00:54.800 --> 2:00:59.560
 because that leads to more full on relapse, just kind of treat it as a learning experience,

2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:00.560
 that type of thing.

2:01:00.560 --> 2:01:07.800
 Then you have the session day where they come in, five minutes of questionnaires, but pretty

2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:14.000
 much they jump into the, we touch base with them and we give them the capsule.

2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:17.560
 It's a serious setting, but a comfortable one.

2:01:17.560 --> 2:01:21.160
 They're in a room that looks more like a living room than like a research lab.

2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:24.920
 We measure their blood pressure than any experience, but kind of minimal kind of medical vibe to

2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:25.920
 it.

2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:32.040
 And they lay down on a couch and it's a purposefully an introspective experience.

2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:36.520
 So they're laying on a couch during most of the five to six hour experience and they're

2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:40.640
 wearing eye shades, which is a better connotation as a name than blindfold.

2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:45.600
 So they're wearing eye shades, but that's, and they're wearing headphones through which

2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:48.480
 music is played.

2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:51.240
 Mostly classical, although we've done some variation of that, I have a paper that was

2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:57.320
 recently accepted, kind of comparing it to more like gongs and harmonic bowls and that

2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:01.560
 type of thing, kind of like sound, you know, kind of.

2:02:01.560 --> 2:02:07.120
 You've also added this to the science and have a paper on the musical accompaniment

2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:09.560
 to the psychedelic experience as fast as you can.

2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:14.040
 And we found basically that about the same effect, even by a trend not significant, but

2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:19.040
 a little bit better of an effect, both in terms of subjective experience and long term,

2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:22.840
 whether it helped people quit smoking, just a little tiny, non significant trend even

2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:29.720
 favoring the novel playlist with the Tibetan singing bowls and the gongs and didgeridoo

2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:32.000
 and all of that.

2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:36.280
 So anyway, just saying, okay, we can deviate a little bit from this, like, what goes back

2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:41.200
 to the 1950s of this method of using classical music as part of this psychedelic therapy.

2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:44.480
 But they're listening to the music and they're not playing DJ in real time.

2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:48.600
 You know, it's like, you know, they're just, be the baby, you're not the decision maker

2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:51.840
 for today, go inward, trust, let go, be open.

2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:57.040
 And pretty much the only interaction, like, that we're there for is to deal with any anxiety

2:02:57.040 --> 2:02:58.040
 that comes up.

2:02:58.040 --> 2:03:00.680
 It is kind of a misnomer, in a sense.

2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:02.800
 It's more of a safety net.

2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:06.560
 And so, like, tell us if you feel some butterflies that we can provide reassurance a hold of

2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:09.120
 their hand can be very powerful.

2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:12.640
 I've had people tell me that that was like the thing that really just grounded them.

2:03:12.640 --> 2:03:22.840
 Can you break apart trust, let go, be open, what, what, so in a sense, how would you describe

2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:30.520
 the experience, the intellectual and the emotional approach that people are supposed to take

2:03:30.520 --> 2:03:34.680
 to really let go into the experience?

2:03:34.680 --> 2:03:43.720
 Yeah, so trust is, trust the context, you know, trust the guides, trust the overall

2:03:43.720 --> 2:03:48.120
 in institutional context, I see it as layers of like safety, even though it's everything

2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:52.000
 I told you about the relative bodily safety of psilocybin, nonetheless, we're still getting

2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.720
 blood pressure throughout the session, just in case.

2:03:54.720 --> 2:03:58.000
 We have a physician on hand who can respond just in case.

2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:01.760
 We're literally across the street from the emergency department, just in case, you know,

2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:02.760
 all of that, you know.

2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:08.200
 Privacy is another thing you've talked about, just trusting that you're, whatever happens

2:04:08.200 --> 2:04:10.960
 is just between you and the people in the study.

2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:15.000
 Right, and hopefully they've really gotten that by that point deep into the study that,

2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:18.600
 like, they realize we take that seriously and everything else, you know, and so it's

2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:23.960
 really kind of like a very special role you're playing as a researcher or guide and hopefully

2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:25.960
 they have your trust.

2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:29.200
 And so, you know, and trust that they could be as emotional, everything from laughter to

2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:31.840
 tears, like, that's going to be welcomed, we're not judging them.

2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:36.560
 It's like, it's a therapeutic relationship where, you know, this is a safe container,

2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:37.560
 it's a safe space.

2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:38.560
 Safe space.

2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:39.560
 That has a lot of baggage to that term.

2:04:39.560 --> 2:04:45.680
 But it truly is, it's a safe space for that, for this type of experience and to let go.

2:04:45.680 --> 2:04:51.920
 So trust, let's see, let go, so that relates to the emotional, like, you feel like crying,

2:04:51.920 --> 2:04:52.920
 cry.

2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:57.320
 You feel like laughing your ass off, laugh your ass off, you know, it's like, all the

2:04:57.320 --> 2:05:02.320
 things actually that, sometimes it's more challenging with a, someone has a large recreational

2:05:02.320 --> 2:05:06.840
 use, sometimes it's harder for them because people in that context, and understandably

2:05:06.840 --> 2:05:09.600
 so, it's more about holding your shit.

2:05:09.600 --> 2:05:14.520
 Someone's had a bunch of mushrooms at a party, maybe they don't want to go into the back

2:05:14.520 --> 2:05:19.600
 room and start crying about this, these thoughts about the relationship with their mother.

2:05:19.600 --> 2:05:23.920
 And they don't want to be the drama queen or king that bring their friends down, because

2:05:23.920 --> 2:05:26.400
 their friends are having an experience too.

2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:28.880
 And so they want to, like, compose, you know.

2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:34.280
 And also just the appearance in social settings versus the, so like prioritizing how you appear

2:05:34.280 --> 2:05:39.520
 to others versus the prioritizing the depth of the experience.

2:05:39.520 --> 2:05:42.600
 And here in the study, you can prioritize the experience.

2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:43.600
 Right.

2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:46.920
 There's a lot about, like, you're the astronaut and we're, there's only one astronaut, we're

2:05:46.920 --> 2:05:48.160
 ground control.

2:05:48.160 --> 2:05:54.560
 And I use this often with, I have a photo of the space shuttle on a plaque in my office

2:05:54.560 --> 2:05:56.760
 and I kind of often use that as an example.

2:05:56.760 --> 2:06:00.320
 And it's like, we're here for you, like we're a team, but we have different roles.

2:06:00.320 --> 2:06:06.080
 It's just like, you don't have to like compose yourself, like you don't have to like be concerned

2:06:06.080 --> 2:06:09.600
 about our safety, like we're playing these roles today.

2:06:09.600 --> 2:06:14.120
 And like, yeah, your job is to go as deep as possible or as far out, whatever your analogy

2:06:14.120 --> 2:06:16.520
 is, like as possible.

2:06:16.520 --> 2:06:18.920
 And we're keeping you safe.

2:06:18.920 --> 2:06:23.840
 And so, yeah, and you really, the emotional side is a hard one, you know, because you

2:06:23.840 --> 2:06:30.000
 really want people to, like if they go into realms of subjectively of despair and sorrow,

2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:35.360
 like, yeah, like cry, you know, like it's okay, you know, and especially if someone's

2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:40.680
 a, you know, more macho, and, you know, you want this to be the place where they can let

2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:41.680
 go.

2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:46.200
 And again, something that they wouldn't or shouldn't do if someone was to theoretically

2:06:46.200 --> 2:06:50.280
 use it in a social setting.

2:06:50.280 --> 2:06:53.840
 And like, and also these other things, like even that you get in those social settings

2:06:53.840 --> 2:06:57.800
 of like, yeah, you don't have to like worry about your wallet for being taken advantage

2:06:57.800 --> 2:07:02.680
 or for socially for a woman sexually assaulted by some creep at a concert or something because

2:07:02.680 --> 2:07:06.400
 they're, you know, they're laying down, even being far out of the session.

2:07:06.400 --> 2:07:11.120
 There's like a million sources of anxiety that are external versus internal.

2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:16.520
 So you can just focus on your own, like the beautiful thing that's going on in your mind.

2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:21.880
 And even the cops at that layer, even though it's extremely unlikely for most people that

2:07:21.880 --> 2:07:25.760
 cops would come in and bust them right when, like even at that theoretical, like that one

2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:29.520
 in a billion chance, like that might be a real thing psychologically.

2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:31.520
 In this context, we even got that covered.

2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:33.200
 This is, we've got DEA approval.

2:07:33.200 --> 2:07:34.200
 Yeah.

2:07:34.200 --> 2:07:38.840
 Like you are, this is okay by every level of society that counts, you know, that has

2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:40.080
 the authority.

2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:45.960
 So it's, so go deep, trust the, you know, trust the setting, trust yourself, you know,

2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:48.080
 let go and be open.

2:07:48.080 --> 2:07:53.480
 So in the experience, and this is all subjective and by analogy, but like, if there's a door,

2:07:53.480 --> 2:07:55.040
 open it, go into it.

2:07:55.040 --> 2:08:00.040
 If there's a stairwell, go down it or stairway, go up it.

2:08:00.040 --> 2:08:04.960
 If there's a monster in the mind's eye, you know, don't run, approach it, look in the

2:08:04.960 --> 2:08:08.160
 eye and say, you know, let's talk.

2:08:08.160 --> 2:08:09.160
 Yeah.

2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:10.160
 What's up?

2:08:10.160 --> 2:08:11.160
 What are you doing here?

2:08:11.160 --> 2:08:12.160
 Let's talk turkey, you know.

2:08:12.160 --> 2:08:14.320
 Dick Goggins entered the chat.

2:08:14.320 --> 2:08:15.320
 Okay.

2:08:15.320 --> 2:08:16.320
 Right.

2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:17.320
 It really is that.

2:08:17.320 --> 2:08:19.840
 That really is a heart of this, this radical courage.

2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:20.840
 Like it.

2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:21.840
 Courage.

2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:22.840
 People are often struck by that coming out.

2:08:22.840 --> 2:08:24.160
 Like this is heavy lifting.

2:08:24.160 --> 2:08:25.680
 This is a hard work.

2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:28.000
 People come out of this exhausted.

2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.320
 And it can be extremely...

2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:34.000
 Some people say it's the most difficult thing they've done in their life, like choosing

2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:40.120
 to let go on a moment, a microsecond by microsecond basis.

2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:44.280
 Everything in their inclination is to say stop sometimes, stop this.

2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:45.280
 I don't like this.

2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:46.400
 I didn't know it was going to be like this.

2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:48.320
 This is too much.

2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:49.920
 And Terrence McKenna put it this way.

2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:54.200
 It's like comparing to meditation and other techniques, it's like spending years trying

2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:57.560
 to press the accelerator to make something happen.

2:08:57.560 --> 2:09:03.160
 Pytose psychedelics is like you're speeding down the mountain in a fully loaded semi truck

2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:06.680
 and you're charged with not slamming the brake.

2:09:06.680 --> 2:09:09.880
 It's like, let it happen.

2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:12.600
 So it's very difficult and to engage.

2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:19.360
 Always go further into it and take that radical courage throughout.

2:09:19.360 --> 2:09:23.000
 What do they say in self report?

2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:26.280
 If you can put general words to it, what is their experience like?

2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:27.880
 What do they say it's like?

2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:32.840
 Because these are many people like you said that haven't probably read much about psychedelics

2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:39.200
 or they don't have like with Joe Rogan, like language or stories to put on it.

2:09:39.200 --> 2:09:44.200
 So this is very raw self report of experiences.

2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:45.920
 What do they say the experience is like?

2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:46.920
 Yeah.

2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:50.280
 And some more so than others because everyone has been exposed at some level or another,

2:09:50.280 --> 2:09:55.680
 but some it is pretty superficial as you're saying.

2:09:55.680 --> 2:09:58.560
 One of the hallmarks of psychedelics is just their variability.

2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:05.080
 So it's like not the mean, but the standard deviation is so wide that it could be like

2:10:05.080 --> 2:10:14.480
 hellish experiences and just absolutely beautiful and loving experiences.

2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:18.120
 Everything in between and both of those.

2:10:18.120 --> 2:10:20.640
 Those could be two minutes apart from each other.

2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:24.200
 And sometimes kind of at the same time concurrently.

2:10:24.200 --> 2:10:28.480
 So let's see, there's different ways to...

2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:33.040
 There were some Jungian psychologists back in the 60s, masters in Houston that wrote

2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:38.120
 a really good book, The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience, kind of which is a play on varieties

2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:44.640
 of religious experience by William James, that they described this a perceptual level.

2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:49.200
 So most people have that, whether they're looking at the room without the eyeshades

2:10:49.200 --> 2:10:56.360
 on or inside their mind's eye with the eyeshades on, colors, sounds like this.

2:10:56.360 --> 2:11:02.440
 It's a much richer sensorium, which can be very interesting.

2:11:02.440 --> 2:11:08.000
 And then at another level, a masters in Houston called it the psychodynamic level.

2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:12.760
 And I think you could think about it more broadly than that's kind of Jungian, but just

2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:17.080
 the personal psychological levels, how I think of it, like this is about your life, there's

2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:18.080
 a whole life review.

2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:22.120
 And oftentimes people have thoughts about their childhood, about their relationships, their

2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:30.320
 spouse or partner, their children, their parents, their family of origin, their current family.

2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:38.680
 That stuff comes up a lot, including people just pouring with tears about how much it

2:11:38.680 --> 2:11:41.880
 hits them so hard, how much they love people.

2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:49.440
 In a way, people that they'd love their family, but it just hits them so hard that how important

2:11:49.440 --> 2:11:54.440
 this is and the magnitude of that love and what that means in their life.

2:11:54.440 --> 2:11:59.880
 So those are some of the most moving experiences to be present for is where people, it hits

2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:03.680
 home like what really matters in their life.

2:12:03.680 --> 2:12:08.720
 And then you have this sort of what masters in Houston called the archetypal realm, which

2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:13.360
 again is sort of Jungian with the focus on archetypes, which is interesting, but I think

2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:16.040
 of that more generally as like symbolic level.

2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:22.160
 So just really deep experiences where you have, you do have experiences that seem symbolic

2:12:22.160 --> 2:12:28.200
 of very much in like what we know about dreaming and what most people think about dreaming.

2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:32.560
 There's this randomness of things, but sometimes it's pretty clear and retrospect, oh, like

2:12:32.560 --> 2:12:37.000
 this came up because this thing has been on my mind recently.

2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:40.320
 So there seems to be this symbolic level.

2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:45.560
 And then they have this, the last level that they describe is the mystical integral level,

2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:51.440
 which in this is where there's lots of terms for it, but transcendental experiences, experiences

2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:56.760
 of unity, mystical type effects we often measure.

2:12:56.760 --> 2:13:00.360
 Europeans use a scale that will refer to oceanic boundlessness.

2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:02.720
 This is all pretty much the same thing.

2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:12.120
 This is like at some sense, the deepest level of the very sense of self seems to be dissolved,

2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:16.520
 minimize or expanded such that the boundaries of the self go into, and here I think some

2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:20.800
 of this is just semantics, but whether the self is expanding such that there's no boundary

2:13:20.800 --> 2:13:26.240
 between the self and the rest of the universe or whether there's no sense of self again

2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:31.480
 might be just semantics, but this radical shift or sense of loss of sense of self or

2:13:31.480 --> 2:13:33.160
 self boundaries.

2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:37.760
 And that's like the most typically when people have that experience, they'll often report

2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:39.680
 that as being the most remarkable thing.

2:13:39.680 --> 2:13:45.600
 And this is what you don't typically get with MDMA, these deepest levels of the nature

2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:54.560
 of reality itself, the subjectivity and objectivity, just like the seer and the seeing become one

2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:57.400
 and it's a process.

2:13:57.400 --> 2:13:58.400
 And yeah.

2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:06.400
 And they're able to bring that experience back and be able to describe it?

2:14:06.400 --> 2:14:12.240
 Yeah, but to a degree, but one of the hallmarks going back to William James of describing

2:14:12.240 --> 2:14:15.680
 a mystical experience is the ineffability.

2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:20.480
 And so even though it's ineffable, people try as far as they can to describe it, but

2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:24.400
 when you get the real deal, they'll say, and even though they say a lot of helpful things

2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:29.320
 to help you describe the landscape, they'll say, no matter what I say, I'm still not even

2:14:29.320 --> 2:14:31.600
 coming anywhere close to what this was.

2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:34.200
 Like the language is completely failing.

2:14:34.200 --> 2:14:38.240
 And I like to joke that even though it's ineffable, and we're researchers, so we try to eff

2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:41.400
 it up by asking them to describe the experience.

2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:42.400
 I love it.

2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:43.400
 Yeah.

2:14:43.400 --> 2:14:44.400
 It's a good one.

2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:50.960
 But to bring it back a little bit, so for that particular study on tobacco, what was

2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:59.440
 the results, what was the conclusions in terms of the impact of psilocybin on their addiction?

2:14:59.440 --> 2:15:03.240
 So in that pilot study, it was very small, and it wasn't a randomized study.

2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:04.240
 So it was limited.

2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:08.600
 The only question we could really answer was, is this worthy enough of follow up?

2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:12.280
 And the answer to that was absolutely freaking lootily, because the success rates were so

2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:18.480
 high, 80% biologically confirmed successful at six months, that held up to 60% biologically

2:15:18.480 --> 2:15:22.760
 confirmed abstinence at an average of two and a half years, a very long fall.

2:15:22.760 --> 2:15:23.760
 Yeah.

2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:28.320
 And so, I mean, the best that's been reported in the literature for smoking cessation is

2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:33.160
 in the upper 50%, and that's with not one, but two medications for a couple of months,

2:15:33.160 --> 2:15:37.880
 followed by regular cognitive behavioral therapy, where you're coming in once a week or once

2:15:37.880 --> 2:15:41.720
 every few weeks for an entire year.

2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:44.680
 And so, you know, it's very heavy.

2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:48.000
 This is just like a few uses of psilocybin?

2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:52.480
 So this was three doses of psilocybin, over a total course, including preparation, everything

2:15:52.480 --> 2:15:58.720
 a 15 week period, where there's mainly like, for most part, one meeting a week, and then

2:15:58.720 --> 2:16:00.880
 the three sessions are within that.

2:16:00.880 --> 2:16:05.560
 And so it's, and we scale that back in the more, the study we're doing right now, which

2:16:05.560 --> 2:16:10.840
 I can tell you about, which is a randomized controlled trial.

2:16:10.840 --> 2:16:20.560
 But it's the, yeah, the original pilot study was these 15 people.

2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:24.960
 So given the positive signal from the first study telling us that it was a worthy pursuit,

2:16:24.960 --> 2:16:28.600
 we hustled up some money to actually be able to afford a larger trial.

2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:35.560
 So it's randomizing 80 people to get either one psilocybin session, we've scaled that

2:16:35.560 --> 2:16:40.560
 down from three to one, mainly because we're doing FMRI neuroimaging before and after,

2:16:40.560 --> 2:16:45.160
 and it made it more experimentally complex to have multiple sessions.

2:16:45.160 --> 2:16:52.760
 But one psilocybin session versus the nicotine patch using the FDA approved label, like standard

2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:53.880
 use of the nicotine patch.

2:16:53.880 --> 2:16:58.960
 So it's randomized, 40 people get randomized to psilocybin, one session, 40 people get

2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:02.960
 nicotine patch, and they all get the same cognitive behavioral therapies for the standard

2:17:02.960 --> 2:17:03.960
 talk therapy.

2:17:03.960 --> 2:17:07.960
 And we've scaled it down somewhat, so there's less weekly meetings, but it's within the

2:17:07.960 --> 2:17:09.520
 same ballpark.

2:17:09.520 --> 2:17:17.560
 And right now, we're still, the study's still ongoing, and in fact, we just recently started

2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:18.560
 recruiting again.

2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:19.560
 We paused for COVID.

2:17:19.560 --> 2:17:23.440
 Now we're starting back up with some protections like masks and whatnot.

2:17:23.440 --> 2:17:31.120
 But right now, for the 44 people who have gotten through the one year follow up, and

2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:36.280
 so that includes 22 from each of the two groups, the success rates are extremely high.

2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:41.600
 For the psilocybin group, it's 59% have been biologically confirmed as smoke free at one

2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:44.120
 year after their quit date.

2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:49.720
 And that compares to 27% for the nicotine patch, which by the way, is extremely good

2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:53.120
 for the nicotine patch compared to previous research.

2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:59.400
 So the results could change because it's ongoing, but we're mostly done, and it's still looking

2:17:59.400 --> 2:18:01.360
 extremely positive.

2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:05.000
 So if anyone's interested, they have to be sort of be in commuting distance to the Baltimore

2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:09.720
 area, but you know, to participate, right, right to participate.

2:18:09.720 --> 2:18:13.600
 This is a, this is a good moment to bring up something.

2:18:13.600 --> 2:18:17.960
 I think a lot of what you talked about is super interesting.

2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:19.920
 And I think a lot of people listening to this.

2:18:19.920 --> 2:18:27.120
 So now it's anywhere from 300 to 600,000 people for just a regular podcast.

2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:31.120
 I know a lot of them will be very interested in what you're saying, and they're going to

2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:36.720
 look you up, they're going to find your email, and they're going to write you a long email

2:18:36.720 --> 2:18:43.560
 about some of the interesting things that found out in any of your papers.

2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:46.080
 How should people contact you?

2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:48.040
 What is the best way for that?

2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:53.720
 Would you recommend your super busy guy, you have a million things going on?

2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:56.760
 What, how should people communicate with you?

2:18:56.760 --> 2:18:57.760
 Thanks for bringing this up.

2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:01.960
 This is a, I'm glad to get the opportunity to address this.

2:19:01.960 --> 2:19:06.400
 If someone's interested in participating in a study, the best thing to do is go to the

2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:07.400
 website.

2:19:07.400 --> 2:19:08.400
 Yeah.

2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:13.680
 Of the study or of like, yeah, which website?

2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:15.800
 So we have all of our psilocybin studies.

2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:21.200
 So everything we have is up on one website, and then we link to the different study websites,

2:19:21.200 --> 2:19:24.600
 but hopkinspsychedelic.org.

2:19:24.600 --> 2:19:29.800
 So everything we do, or if you don't remember that, just go to your favorite search engine

2:19:29.800 --> 2:19:33.480
 and look up Johns Hopkins Psychedelic, and you're going to find one of the first hits

2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:36.240
 is going to be our, is this website.

2:19:36.240 --> 2:19:39.120
 And there's going to be links to the smoking study and all of our other studies.

2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:42.440
 If there's no link to it there, we don't have a study on it now.

2:19:42.440 --> 2:19:47.320
 And if you're interested in psychedelic research more broadly, you can look up, like

2:19:47.320 --> 2:19:50.800
 at another university that might be closer to you, and there's a handful of them now

2:19:50.800 --> 2:19:55.200
 across the country, and there's some in Europe that have studies going on.

2:19:55.200 --> 2:20:01.080
 But you can, at least in the U.S., you can look at clinicaltrials.gov and look up the

2:20:01.080 --> 2:20:02.080
 term psilocybin.

2:20:02.080 --> 2:20:06.000
 And in fact, optionally, people even in Europe can register their trial on there.

2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:07.760
 So that's a good way to find studies.

2:20:07.760 --> 2:20:13.600
 But for our research, rather than emailing me, like a more efficient way is to go straight,

2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:18.800
 and you can do that first, the first phase of screening, there's some questions online,

2:20:18.800 --> 2:20:22.080
 and then someone will get back in touch with you.

2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:30.560
 But I do already, and I expect it's like going to increase, but I'm already at the level

2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:36.360
 where my simple, limited mind and limited capacity is already, I sometimes fail to get

2:20:36.360 --> 2:20:37.360
 back to emails.

2:20:37.360 --> 2:20:43.680
 I mean, I'm trying to respond to my colleagues, my mentees, all these things, my responsibilities.

2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:47.880
 And as many of the people just inquiring about, I want to go to graduate school, I'm interested

2:20:47.880 --> 2:20:48.880
 in this.

2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:53.160
 I had this, I have a daughter that took us like a duck, and she's having trot wins.

2:20:53.160 --> 2:20:58.080
 I try to respond to those, but sometimes I just simply can't get to all of them already.

2:20:58.080 --> 2:21:04.280
 To be honest, from my perspective, it's been quite heartbreaking, because I basically don't

2:21:04.280 --> 2:21:07.880
 respond to any emails anymore.

2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:14.720
 And especially as you mentioned, mentees and so on, outside of that circle, it's heartbreaking

2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:19.800
 to me how many brilliant people there are, thoughtful people, like loving people, and

2:21:19.800 --> 2:21:26.440
 they write long emails that are really, by the way, I do read them very often.

2:21:26.440 --> 2:21:31.960
 It's just that I don't, the response is then you're starting a conversation.

2:21:31.960 --> 2:21:38.360
 And the heartbreaking aspect is you only have so many hours in the day to have deep, meaningful

2:21:38.360 --> 2:21:40.440
 conversation with human beings on this earth.

2:21:40.440 --> 2:21:44.560
 And so you have to select who they are, and usually it's your family, it's people like

2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:46.600
 you're directly working with.

2:21:46.600 --> 2:21:52.400
 And even I guarantee you with this conversation, people will write you long, really thoughtful

2:21:52.400 --> 2:21:58.280
 emails, like there'll be brilliant people, faculty from all over, PhD students from all

2:21:58.280 --> 2:21:59.280
 over.

2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:03.800
 And it's heartbreaking because you can't really get back to them, but you're saying like, many

2:22:03.800 --> 2:22:07.720
 of them, if you do respond, it's more like, here, go to this website.

2:22:07.720 --> 2:22:12.360
 If you're, when you're interested into the study, just it makes sense to directly go

2:22:12.360 --> 2:22:16.720
 to the site if there's applications open, just apply for the study.

2:22:16.720 --> 2:22:18.720
 Right, right, right.

2:22:18.720 --> 2:22:25.760
 As either a volunteer or if we're looking for somebody, we're gonna be posting, including

2:22:25.760 --> 2:22:30.880
 on the Hopkins University website, we're gonna be posting if we're looking for a position.

2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:35.560
 I am right now actually looking through and it's mainly been through email and contacts,

2:22:35.560 --> 2:22:37.560
 but should I say it?

2:22:37.560 --> 2:22:41.800
 I think I'd rather cast my nets wide, but I'm looking for a postdoc right now.

2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:47.240
 So I've mentored postdocs for, I don't know, like a dozen years or so and more and more

2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:52.360
 of their time is being spent on psychedelics, so someone's free to contact me.

2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:55.040
 That's more of a, that's sort of so close to home.

2:22:55.040 --> 2:22:58.520
 That's a personal, you know, that like emailing me about that.

2:22:58.520 --> 2:23:04.160
 But I come to appreciate more the advice that folks like Tim Ferriss have of like, I think

2:23:04.160 --> 2:23:10.560
 it's him like five cents emails, you know, like, you know, a subject that gets to the

2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:14.480
 point that tells you what it's about so that like you break through the signal to the noise.

2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:17.600
 But I really appreciate what you're saying because part of the equation for me is like,

2:23:17.600 --> 2:23:22.400
 I have a three year old and like my time on the ground, on the floor, playing blocks or

2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:26.120
 cars with him is part of that equation.

2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:29.560
 And even if the day is ending and I know some of those emails are slipping by and I'll never

2:23:29.560 --> 2:23:34.120
 get back to them and I have, I'm struggling with it already and I get what you're saying

2:23:34.120 --> 2:23:38.960
 is like, I haven't seen anything yet with the type of exposure that like your podcast

2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:39.960
 gets.

2:23:39.960 --> 2:23:40.960
 This will bring an exposure.

2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:44.480
 And then I think in terms of postdocs, this is a really good podcast in the sense that

2:23:44.480 --> 2:23:49.080
 there's a lot of brilliant PhD students out there that are looking for posters from all

2:23:49.080 --> 2:23:53.720
 over from MIT, probably from Hopkins is just all over the place.

2:23:53.720 --> 2:23:59.680
 So this is, and I, we have different preferences, but my preference would also be to have like

2:23:59.680 --> 2:24:04.840
 a form that they could fill out for posts because, you know, it's very difficult through

2:24:04.840 --> 2:24:10.400
 email to tell who's a really going to be a strong collaborator for you, like a strong

2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:16.520
 postdoc, strong student, because you want a bunch of details, but at the same time,

2:24:16.520 --> 2:24:19.120
 you don't want a million pages worth of email.

2:24:19.120 --> 2:24:21.600
 So you want a little bit of application process.

2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:29.400
 So usually set up a form that helps me indicate how passionate the person is, how willing

2:24:29.400 --> 2:24:33.360
 they are to do hard work.

2:24:33.360 --> 2:24:39.480
 Like I often ask a question, people of what do you think it's more important to work

2:24:39.480 --> 2:24:41.680
 hard or to work smart?

2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:49.640
 And I use that, those types of questions to indicate who I would like to work with.

2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:51.640
 Because it's counterintuitive.

2:24:51.640 --> 2:24:57.880
 But anyway, I'll leave, I'll leave that question unanswered for people to figure out themselves.

2:24:57.880 --> 2:25:01.720
 But maybe if you know my love for David Goggins, you'll understand.

2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:02.720
 So anyway.

2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:05.000
 Those are good thoughts about the forms and everything.

2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:06.000
 It's difficult.

2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:07.640
 And that's something that evolves.

2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:10.040
 Email is such a messy thing.

2:25:10.040 --> 2:25:18.480
 There's speaking of Baltimore, Cal Newport, if you know who that is, he wrote a book

2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:19.480
 called Deep Work.

2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:23.760
 He's a computer science professor and he's currently working on a book about email, about

2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:25.880
 all the ways that email is broken.

2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:28.800
 This is going to be a fascinating read.

2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:36.760
 This is a little bit of a general question, but almost a bigger picture question that

2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:41.760
 we touched on a little bit, but let's just touch it in a full way, which is, what have

2:25:41.760 --> 2:25:49.600
 all the psychedelic studies you've conducted taught you about the human mind?

2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:52.440
 About the human brain and the human mind?

2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:58.120
 Is there something, if you look at the human scientists you were before this work and the

2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:05.080
 scientists you are now, how is your understanding of the human mind changed?

2:26:05.080 --> 2:26:08.720
 I'm thinking of that in two categories.

2:26:08.720 --> 2:26:19.800
 One kind of more scientific, and they're both scientific, but one more about the brain and

2:26:19.800 --> 2:26:23.360
 behavior in the mind, so to speak.

2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:28.920
 As a behaviorist, all we see sort of the mind as a metaphor for behaviors, but anyway, that

2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:33.040
 gets philosophical.

2:26:33.040 --> 2:26:40.840
 It's really increasing the, so the one category is increasing the appreciation for the magnitude

2:26:40.840 --> 2:26:43.840
 of depth.

2:26:43.840 --> 2:26:49.400
 These are all metaphors of human experience that might be a good way to, because you use

2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:53.960
 certain words like consciousness and what it's like, we're using constructs that aren't

2:26:53.960 --> 2:27:02.280
 well defined unless we kind of dig in, but into human experience, like that the experiences

2:27:02.280 --> 2:27:10.720
 on these compounds can be so far out there or so deep, and they're doing that by tinkering

2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:15.040
 with the same machinery that's going on up there.

2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:21.080
 My assumption, and I think it's a good assumption, is that all experiences, there's a biological

2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:26.400
 side to all phenomenal experience.

2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:37.800
 There is not, the divide between biology and experience or psychology is, it's not one

2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:38.800
 or the other.

2:27:38.800 --> 2:27:42.400
 These are just two sides of the same coin.

2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:48.520
 I mean, you're avoiding the use of the word consciousness, for example, but the experiences

2:27:48.520 --> 2:27:51.560
 are referring to the subjective experience.

2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:58.080
 It's the actual technical use of the word consciousness of, yeah, subjective experience.

2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:02.320
 Even that word, there are certain ways that, if we're talking about access consciousness

2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:08.120
 or narrative self awareness, which is an aspect of, you can wrap a definition around

2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:11.440
 that and we can talk meaningfully about it, but so often around psychedelics, it's used

2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:17.600
 in this much more in terms of ultimately explaining phenomenal consciousness itself, the so called

2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:25.640
 hard problem relating to that question and psychedelics really haven't spoken to that

2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:29.120
 and that's why it's hard because it's hard to imagine anything.

2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:34.600
 But I think what I was getting is that psychedelics have done this by, the reason I was getting

2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:42.240
 into the biology versus mind psychology divide is that just to kind of set up the fact that

2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:49.280
 I think all of our experience is related to these biological events.

2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:55.280
 So whether they be naturally occurring neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine and norepinephrine

2:28:55.280 --> 2:29:01.600
 et cetera, and a whole other sort of biological activity and kind of another layer up that

2:29:01.600 --> 2:29:05.600
 we could talk about as network activity, communication amongst brain areas, this is

2:29:05.600 --> 2:29:11.120
 always going on, even if I just prompt you to think about a loved one, there's something

2:29:11.120 --> 2:29:17.760
 happening biologically, okay, so that's always another side of the coin.

2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:22.160
 And another way to put that is all of our subjective experience outside of drugs, it's

2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:29.800
 all a controlled hallucination in a sense, this is completely constructed, our experience

2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:33.800
 of reality is completely a simulation.

2:29:33.800 --> 2:29:37.840
 So I think we're on solid ground to say that that's our best guess and that's a pretty

2:29:37.840 --> 2:29:41.240
 reasonable thing to say scientifically.

2:29:41.240 --> 2:29:46.040
 All the rich complexity of the world emerges from just some biology and some chemicals.

2:29:46.040 --> 2:29:51.880
 So that definition implied a causation, it comes from, and so we know at least there's

2:29:51.880 --> 2:29:58.480
 a solid correlation there, and so then we delve deep into the philosophy of idealism

2:29:58.480 --> 2:30:02.160
 or materialism and things like this, which I'm not an expert in, but I know we're getting

2:30:02.160 --> 2:30:08.480
 into that territory, you don't even necessarily have to go there, at least go to the level

2:30:08.480 --> 2:30:13.880
 of like, okay, we know there seems to be this one on one correspondence, and that seems

2:30:13.880 --> 2:30:17.560
 pretty solid, like you can't prove a negative and you can't prove, you know, it's in that

2:30:17.560 --> 2:30:21.840
 category of like, you could come up with an experience that maybe doesn't have a biological

2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:25.960
 correlate, but then you're talking about there's also the limits of the science, so is it

2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:30.720
 a false negative, but I think our best guess and a very decent assumption is that every

2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:33.760
 psychological event has a biological correlate.

2:30:33.760 --> 2:30:40.960
 So with that said, you know, the idea that you can throw, alter that biology in a pretty

2:30:40.960 --> 2:30:46.400
 trivial manner, I mean, you could take like a relatively small number of these molecules,

2:30:46.400 --> 2:30:54.840
 throw them into the nervous system, and then have a 60 year old person who has, I mean,

2:30:54.840 --> 2:31:01.520
 you name it, I mean, that has hiked to the top of Everest, and that speaks five languages,

2:31:01.520 --> 2:31:07.000
 and that has been married, and has kids and grandkids, and has, you name it, you know,

2:31:07.000 --> 2:31:14.960
 like, been at the top and say, this fundamentally changed who I am as a person, and what I think

2:31:14.960 --> 2:31:17.160
 life is about.

2:31:17.160 --> 2:31:25.880
 Like that's the thing about psychedelics that just floors me, and it never fails, I mean,

2:31:25.880 --> 2:31:30.160
 sometimes you get bogged down by the paperwork and running studies and all the, I don't know,

2:31:30.160 --> 2:31:35.880
 all of the BS that can come with being in academia and everything, and then you, and

2:31:35.880 --> 2:31:39.960
 sometimes you get some dud sessions where it's not the full, all the magic isn't happening,

2:31:39.960 --> 2:31:44.760
 and it's, you know, more or less, it's either a dud or somewhere, and I don't mean to dismiss

2:31:44.760 --> 2:31:48.520
 them, but you know, it's not like these magnificent sort of reports, but sometimes you get the

2:31:48.520 --> 2:31:53.800
 full Monty report from one of these people, and you're like, oh yeah, that's why we're

2:31:53.800 --> 2:32:01.800
 doing this, whether it's like, therapeutically or just to understand the mind, and you're

2:32:01.800 --> 2:32:05.840
 like, you're still floored, like, how was that possible?

2:32:05.840 --> 2:32:13.720
 How did we slightly alter serotonergic neurotransmission, and say, and this person is now saying that

2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:19.480
 they're making fundamental differences in the priorities of their life after 60 years?

2:32:19.480 --> 2:32:28.840
 It also just fills you with all of the possibility of experiences we're yet to have uncovered.

2:32:28.840 --> 2:32:37.000
 If just a few chemicals can change so much, it's like, man, what if this could be, I mean,

2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:42.480
 like, because we're just like, took a little, it's like lighting a match or something in

2:32:42.480 --> 2:32:46.160
 the darkness, and you could see there's a lot more there, but you don't know how much

2:32:46.160 --> 2:32:47.160
 more.

2:32:47.160 --> 2:32:48.160
 Right.

2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:53.240
 And then like, where's that going to go with like, I mean, I'm always like aware of the

2:32:53.240 --> 2:32:57.520
 fact that like, we always, as humans and as scientists think that we figured out 99%

2:32:57.520 --> 2:33:01.160
 and we're working on that first 1%, and we got to keep reminding ourselves, it's hard

2:33:01.160 --> 2:33:05.840
 to do like, we figured out like, not even 1%, like we know nothing.

2:33:05.840 --> 2:33:10.960
 And so like, I can speculate and I might sound like a fool, but like, what are drugs, even

2:33:10.960 --> 2:33:18.880
 the concept of drugs, like 10 years, 50 years, 100 years, 1,000 years if we're surviving,

2:33:18.880 --> 2:33:25.160
 like molecules that go to a specific area of the brain in combination with technology,

2:33:25.160 --> 2:33:31.400
 in combination with the magnetic stimulation, in combination with the like targeted pharmacology

2:33:31.400 --> 2:33:37.760
 of like, oh, like this subset of serotonin 2A receptors in the classroom at this time

2:33:37.760 --> 2:33:42.200
 in this particular sequence in combination with this other thing, like this baseball

2:33:42.200 --> 2:33:47.640
 cap you wear that like has, you know, has, has one of the, is doing some of these things

2:33:47.640 --> 2:33:51.640
 that we can only do with these like giant like pieces of equipment now, like where it's

2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:56.760
 going to go is going to be endless and it becomes easy to combine within virtual reality

2:33:56.760 --> 2:34:00.920
 where the virtual reality is going to move from being something out here to being more

2:34:00.920 --> 2:34:01.920
 in there.

2:34:01.920 --> 2:34:06.600
 And then we're getting, like we talked about before, we're already in a virtual reality

2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:14.000
 in terms of human perception and cognition models of the universe being all representations

2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:18.360
 and, you know, sort of, you know, color not existing and just, you know, our representations

2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:23.880
 of EM wavelengths, et cetera, you know, sound being vibrations and all of this.

2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:30.600
 And so as the external VR and the internal VR come closer to each other, like this is

2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:35.560
 what I think about in terms of the future of drugs, like all of this stuff sort of combines

2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:42.320
 and, and like where that goes is just it's, it's unthinkable.

2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:45.960
 Like we were probably going to, you know, again, it might sound like a fool and this

2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:50.920
 may not happen, but I think it's possible, you know, to go completely off line, like

2:34:50.920 --> 2:34:59.040
 where most of people's experiences may be going into these internal worlds.

2:34:59.040 --> 2:35:04.160
 And I mean, maybe you threw through some through a combination of these techniques, you create

2:35:04.160 --> 2:35:08.960
 experiences where someone could live a thousand years in terms of maybe they're living a regular

2:35:08.960 --> 2:35:13.240
 lifespan, but in over the next two seconds, you're living a thousand years worth of experience

2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:17.800
 inside, inside your mind through the, yeah, through this manipulation of the like, is

2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:19.480
 that possible?

2:35:19.480 --> 2:35:25.640
 Like just based on, on like first principles and like, I think so.

2:35:25.640 --> 2:35:26.640
 Yeah.

2:35:26.640 --> 2:35:31.800
 Like give us another fifty hundred, five hundred, like who knows, but like how could it not

2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:32.800
 go there?

2:35:32.800 --> 2:35:40.280
 And a small tangent, what are your thoughts in this broader definition of drugs, of psychedelics,

2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:42.320
 of mind altering things?

2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:49.160
 What are your thoughts about neural link and brain computer interfaces sort of being able

2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:58.440
 to electrically stimulate and read and neuronal activity in the brain and then connect that

2:35:58.440 --> 2:36:05.640
 to the computer, which is another way from a computational perspective for me is kind

2:36:05.640 --> 2:36:14.560
 of appealing, but is another way of altering subtly the behavior of the brain that's kind

2:36:14.560 --> 2:36:20.440
 of, if you zoom out reminiscent of the way psychedelics do as well.

2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:26.280
 So what do you have, like what are your thoughts about neural link, what are your hopes as

2:36:26.280 --> 2:36:32.080
 a researcher of mind altering devices, systems, chemicals?

2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:36.040
 I guess broadly speaking, I'm all for it.

2:36:36.040 --> 2:36:40.520
 I mean, for the same reason I am with psychedelics, but it comes with all the caveats.

2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:44.600
 You know, you're going into a brave new world where it's like all of a sudden there's going

2:36:44.600 --> 2:36:51.160
 to be a dark side, there's going to be, you know, that serious ethical considerations,

2:36:51.160 --> 2:36:54.680
 but that should not stop us from moving there.

2:36:54.680 --> 2:36:59.480
 I mean, particularly the stuff from an unknown expert, but on the short list in the short

2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:02.640
 term, it's like, yeah, can we help these serious neurological disorders?

2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:05.160
 Like, hell yeah.

2:37:05.160 --> 2:37:11.160
 And I'm also sensitive to something being someone that has lots of neuroscience colleagues,

2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:16.920
 you know, with some of this stuff, and I can't talk about particulars I'm not recalling,

2:37:16.920 --> 2:37:24.880
 you know, in terms of, you know, stuff getting out there and then kind of a mocking of, you

2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:27.160
 know, oh gosh, they're saying this is unique.

2:37:27.160 --> 2:37:32.000
 We know this or sort of like this belittling of like, oh, you know, this sounds like it's

2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:35.920
 just a, I don't know, a commercialization or like an oversimplification.

2:37:35.920 --> 2:37:40.200
 I forget what the example was, but something like something that came off to some of my

2:37:40.200 --> 2:37:44.360
 neuroscientific colleagues as an oversimplification or at least the way they said it.

2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:46.160
 Oh, from a neural link perspective.

2:37:46.160 --> 2:37:47.160
 Right.

2:37:47.160 --> 2:37:52.480
 Oh, we've known that for years and like, but I'm very sympathetic to like, maybe it's

2:37:52.480 --> 2:37:58.760
 because of my very limited, but relatively speaking, the amount of exposure the psychedelic

2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:01.880
 work has had to my limited experience of being out there.

2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:06.400
 And then you think about someone like, like Musk who's like, like really, really out there

2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:12.040
 and you just get all these arrows that like, and it's hard to be like when you're plowing

2:38:12.040 --> 2:38:17.360
 new ground, like you're going to get, you're going to criticize like every little word

2:38:17.360 --> 2:38:21.040
 that you, like this balance between speaking to like people to make it meaningful, something

2:38:21.040 --> 2:38:23.240
 scientists aren't very good at.

2:38:23.240 --> 2:38:26.920
 Having people understand what you're saying and then being belittled by oversimplifying

2:38:26.920 --> 2:38:30.200
 something in terms of the public message.

2:38:30.200 --> 2:38:34.960
 So I'm extremely sympathetic and I'm a big fan of like what that, you know, what Elon

2:38:34.960 --> 2:38:40.680
 Musk does, like tunnels through the ground and SpaceX and all this is like, hell yeah,

2:38:40.680 --> 2:38:43.880
 like this guy has some, he has some great ideas.

2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:48.080
 And there's something to be said, it's not just the communication to the public.

2:38:48.080 --> 2:38:52.160
 I think his first principle is thinking it's like, because I get this in the artificial

2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:57.000
 intelligence world is probably similar to neuroscience world where Elon will say something

2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:03.520
 like, or I worked at MIT, I worked on autonomous vehicles and he's sort of, I get sense how

2:39:03.520 --> 2:39:09.920
 much he pisses off like every roboticist at MIT and everybody who works on like the

2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:15.880
 human factor side of safety of autonomous vehicles in saying like, we don't need to

2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:20.360
 consider human beings in the car, like the car will drive itself.

2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:22.920
 It's obvious that neural networks is all you need.

2:39:22.920 --> 2:39:30.120
 Like it's obvious that like we should be able to systems that should be able to learn constantly

2:39:30.120 --> 2:39:32.120
 and they don't really need LiDAR.

2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:38.320
 They just need cameras because we humans just use our eyes and that's the same as cameras.

2:39:38.320 --> 2:39:42.160
 So like it doesn't, why would we need anything else and you just have to make a system that

2:39:42.160 --> 2:39:46.640
 learns faster and faster and faster and neural networks can do that.

2:39:46.640 --> 2:39:49.000
 And so that's pissing off every single community.

2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:52.680
 It's pissing off human factors community saying you don't need to consider the human

2:39:52.680 --> 2:39:53.880
 driver in the picture.

2:39:53.880 --> 2:39:56.200
 You can just focus on the robotics problem.

2:39:56.200 --> 2:40:01.560
 It's pissing off every robotics person for saying LiDAR can be just ignored.

2:40:01.560 --> 2:40:02.880
 It can be camera.

2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:06.440
 Every robotics person knows that camera is really noisy.

2:40:06.440 --> 2:40:13.880
 It's really difficult to deal with, but he's, and then every AI person who says, who hears

2:40:13.880 --> 2:40:19.680
 neural networks and says like, neural networks can learn everything, like almost presuming

2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:22.280
 that it's kind of going to achieve general intelligence.

2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:28.640
 The problem with all those haters in the three communities is that they're looking one year

2:40:28.640 --> 2:40:31.160
 ahead, five years ahead.

2:40:31.160 --> 2:40:36.800
 The hilarious thing about the, quote unquote, ridiculous things that Elon Musk is saying

2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:40.640
 is they have a pretty good shot at being true in 20 years.

2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:45.760
 And so like when you just look at the, you know, when you look at the progression of

2:40:45.760 --> 2:40:51.920
 these kinds of predictions and sometimes first principles, thinking can allow you to do that

2:40:51.920 --> 2:40:58.040
 is you see that it's kind of obvious that things are going to progress this way.

2:40:58.040 --> 2:41:04.840
 And if you just remove your, the prejudice you hold about the particular battles of the

2:41:04.840 --> 2:41:09.720
 current academic environment and just look at the big picture of the progression of the

2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:15.880
 technology, you can usually, you can usually see the world in the same kind of way.

2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:21.640
 And so in that same way, looking at psychedelics, you can see like there is so many exciting

2:41:21.640 --> 2:41:22.840
 possibilities here.

2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:26.960
 If we fully engage in the research, same thing with neural link.

2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:32.480
 If we fully engage, so we go from a thousand channels of communication of the brain to

2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:36.040
 billions of channels of communication of the brain.

2:41:36.040 --> 2:41:41.240
 And we figure out many of the details of how to do that safely with a neurosurgery and

2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:47.600
 so on, that the world would just change completely in the same kind of way that Elon is, it's

2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:55.560
 so ridiculous to hear him talk about a symbiotic relationship between AI and the human brain.

2:41:55.560 --> 2:42:00.640
 But it's like, is it though?

2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:06.120
 Is it because it's, I can see in the 50 years that's going to be an obvious, like everyone

2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:10.680
 will have, like obviously you have, like why are we typing stuff in the computer?

2:42:10.680 --> 2:42:12.200
 It doesn't make any sense.

2:42:12.200 --> 2:42:13.200
 That's stupid.

2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:16.320
 People used to type on a keyboard with a mouse.

2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:17.320
 What is that?

2:42:17.320 --> 2:42:18.320
 It seems pretty clear.

2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:19.320
 Like we're going to be there.

2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:20.320
 Yeah.

2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:21.720
 Like, and the only question is like, what's the timeframe?

2:42:21.720 --> 2:42:24.160
 Is that going to be 20 or is it 50 or 100?

2:42:24.160 --> 2:42:25.600
 How could we not?

2:42:25.600 --> 2:42:31.640
 And the thing that I guess upsets with Elon and others is the timeline he tends to do.

2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:33.760
 I think a lot of people tend to do that kind of thing.

2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:38.640
 I definitely do it, which is like, it'll be done this year versus like it'll be done in

2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:39.640
 10 years.

2:42:39.640 --> 2:42:43.920
 The timeline is a little bit too rushed, but from our leadership perspective, it inspires

2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:50.640
 the engineers to do the best work of their life to really kind of believe, because to

2:42:50.640 --> 2:42:55.080
 do the impossible, you have to first believe it, which is a really important aspect of

2:42:55.080 --> 2:42:56.080
 innovation.

2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:58.760
 And there's the delayed discounting aspect I talked about before.

2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:01.840
 It's like saying, oh, this is going to be a thing 20, 50 years from now.

2:43:01.840 --> 2:43:03.840
 It's like, what motivates anybody?

2:43:03.840 --> 2:43:08.800
 And even if you're fudging it or like wishful thinking a little bit or let's just say airing

2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:14.760
 on one side of the probability distribution, like there's value in saying like, yeah, like

2:43:14.760 --> 2:43:17.240
 there's a chance we could get this done in a year.

2:43:17.240 --> 2:43:21.480
 And you know what, and if you set a goal for a year and you're not successful, hey, you

2:43:21.480 --> 2:43:25.920
 might get it done in three years, whereas if you had aimed at 20 years, well, you either

2:43:25.920 --> 2:43:28.720
 would have never done it at all, or you would have aimed at 20 years and then would have

2:43:28.720 --> 2:43:30.120
 taken you a 10.

2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:35.960
 So the other thing I think about this, like in terms of his work and I guess we've seen

2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:40.600
 with psychedelics, it's like, there's a lack of appreciation for like sort of the variability

2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:46.400
 you need in natural selection, sort of extrapolating from biological, you know, from evolution.

2:43:46.400 --> 2:43:52.560
 Like, hey, maybe he's wrong about focusing only on the cameras and not these other things.

2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:53.840
 Be empirically driven.

2:43:53.840 --> 2:43:57.800
 It's like, yeah, you need to like when he's, you know, when you need to get the regulations,

2:43:57.800 --> 2:43:59.120
 is it safe enough to get the same on the road?

2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:01.320
 Those are real questions and be empirically driven.

2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:06.040
 And if he can meet the whatever standard is relevant, that's the standard and be driven

2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:07.040
 by that.

2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:11.640
 So don't let it affect your ethics, but if he's on the wrong path, how wonderful someone's

2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:12.640
 exploring that wrong path.

2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:16.280
 He's going to figure out it's a wrong path and like other people, he's damn it.

2:44:16.280 --> 2:44:18.000
 He's doing something.

2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:26.080
 Like he's, you know, and appreciating that variability, you know, that like it's valuable

2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:29.840
 even if he's not on, I mean, this is all over the place in science.

2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:31.120
 It's like a good theory.

2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:37.160
 One standard definition is that it generates testable hypotheses and like the ultimate

2:44:37.160 --> 2:44:39.320
 model is never going to be the same as reality.

2:44:39.320 --> 2:44:43.720
 Some models are going to work better than others like, you know, Newtonian physics got

2:44:43.720 --> 2:44:49.680
 us a long ways, even if there was a better model, like waiting.

2:44:49.680 --> 2:44:54.120
 And some models weren't as good as, you know, we're never that successful, but just even

2:44:54.120 --> 2:44:56.480
 like putting them out there and test it.

2:44:56.480 --> 2:45:00.160
 We wouldn't know something is a bad model until someone puts it out anyway.

2:45:00.160 --> 2:45:01.160
 So yeah.

2:45:01.160 --> 2:45:04.000
 Diversity of ideas is essential for progress.

2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:05.000
 Yeah.

2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:07.960
 So we brought up consciousness a few times.

2:45:07.960 --> 2:45:11.320
 There's several things I want to kind of disentangle there.

2:45:11.320 --> 2:45:16.520
 The one you've recently wrote a paper titled consciousness, religion and gurus pitfalls

2:45:16.520 --> 2:45:19.400
 of psychedelic medicine.

2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:20.600
 So that's one side of it.

2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:26.640
 You've kind of already mentioned that these terms can be a little bit misused or, or used

2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:32.680
 in a variety of ways that they can be confusing.

2:45:32.680 --> 2:45:40.040
 But in a specific way, as much as we can be specific about these things about the actual

2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:45.320
 heart problem of consciousness or understanding what is consciousness, this weird thing that

2:45:45.320 --> 2:45:54.040
 it feels like, it feels like something to experience things have psychedelics giving

2:45:54.040 --> 2:45:58.360
 you some kind of insight on what is consciousness.

2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:04.800
 You've mentioned that it feels like psychedelics allows you to kind of dismantle your sense

2:46:04.800 --> 2:46:11.360
 of self, like step outside of yourself.

2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:16.120
 That feels like somehow playing with this mechanism of consciousness.

2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:21.520
 And if it is in fact playing with a mechanism of consciousness using just a few chemicals,

2:46:21.520 --> 2:46:28.320
 it feels like we're very much in the neighborhood of being able to maybe understand the actual

2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:32.800
 biological mechanisms of how consciousness can emerge from the brain.

2:46:32.800 --> 2:46:35.560
 So yeah, there's, there's a bunch there, I think.

2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:41.280
 My preface is that I certainly have opinions that are outside, that I can say, here are

2:46:41.280 --> 2:46:47.480
 my best speculations as a, as just a person and an armchair philosopher.

2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:52.280
 And it's that philosophy is certainly not my, my training and my expertise.

2:46:52.280 --> 2:46:57.280
 So I have thoughts there, but that, that I recognize are completely in the realm of speculation

2:46:57.280 --> 2:47:03.560
 that are like things that I would love to wrap empirical science around, but that are,

2:47:03.560 --> 2:47:09.880
 you know, there's no data and getting to the hard problem, like no conceivable way, even

2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:14.640
 though I'm, I'm very open, like I'm hoping that, that problem can be cracked.

2:47:14.640 --> 2:47:18.000
 And I do, I, as an armchair philosopher, I do think that is a problem.

2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:22.960
 I don't think it can be dismissed as some people argue it's not even really a problem.

2:47:22.960 --> 2:47:27.360
 It strikes me that, that explaining just the existence of phenomenal consciousness is a

2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:28.360
 problem.

2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:31.840
 So anyway, I, I very much had to keep that divide in mind when I talk about these things,

2:47:31.840 --> 2:47:35.480
 what we can really say about what we've learned through science, including by psychedelics

2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:42.880
 versus like what I can speculate on in terms of, you know, the nature of reality and consciousness.

2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:51.480
 But in terms of by and large, skeptically, I have to say psychedelics have not really

2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:58.360
 taught us anything about the nature of consciousness and hopeful that they will, they, they have

2:47:58.360 --> 2:48:03.440
 been used around certain, I don't even know if features is the right term, but things

2:48:03.440 --> 2:48:04.800
 that are called consciousness.

2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:09.160
 So consciousness can refer to not only just phenomenal consciousness, which is like,

2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:14.920
 you know, the, the, the source of the hard problem and what it is to be like Nagel's

2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:21.600
 description, but the sense of self or so, which can be sort of like the, the experiential

2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:25.920
 self moment to moment, or it can be like the narrative self, the string together of story.

2:48:25.920 --> 2:48:33.840
 So those are things that I think can be and a little bit's been done with, with psychedelics

2:48:33.840 --> 2:48:42.280
 regarding that, but I, I think there's far more potential like, but so like one story

2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:48.240
 that unfolded is that psychedelics acutely have an effects on the default mode network,

2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:54.040
 a certain, a pattern of activation amongst a subset of brain areas that is associated

2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:58.880
 with self referential processing seems to be more active, more communication between

2:48:58.880 --> 2:49:05.480
 these areas like the posterior, cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex,

2:49:05.480 --> 2:49:11.320
 for example, being parts of this that are, and others that are tied with sort of thinking

2:49:11.320 --> 2:49:15.800
 about yourself, remembering yourself in the past, projecting yourself into the future.

2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:22.640
 And so that it's an interesting story emerge when, when it was found that when psilocybin

2:49:22.640 --> 2:49:27.760
 is on board, you know, in the person's system, that there's a deep, there's less communication

2:49:27.760 --> 2:49:33.440
 amongst these, these areas. So with resting state FMRI imaging, that there's, there's

2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:40.480
 less synchronization or presumably communication between these areas. And so I think it was,

2:49:40.480 --> 2:49:45.520
 it has been overstated into, ah, we see this is like, this is the dissolving of the ego.

2:49:45.520 --> 2:49:52.160
 This is, the story made a whole lot of sense, but there's several, I think that story is

2:49:52.160 --> 2:49:57.480
 really being challenged. Like one, we see increasing number of drugs that are, that,

2:49:57.480 --> 2:50:03.080
 that decouple that network, including ones like that aren't psychedelic. So this may

2:50:03.080 --> 2:50:08.320
 just be a property, frankly, of being like, you know, screwed up, you know, like, you

2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:11.960
 know, being out of your head, being like, like, you know, anytime you mess with a perception

2:50:11.960 --> 2:50:18.920
 system, maybe it screws up some, some, just our ability to just function in the, the holistically

2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:24.120
 like we do in order, yeah, for the brain to perceive stuff, to be able to map it to memory,

2:50:24.120 --> 2:50:28.560
 to connect things together, the, the, the whole recurrent mechanism that, that could

2:50:28.560 --> 2:50:32.360
 just be messed with, with drugs. Right. And it couldn't, I'm speculating, it could

2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:36.040
 be tied to more if you had to download into the language, everyday language, like not

2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:39.720
 feeling like yourself. Like, so whether that be like really drunk, or really hopped up

2:50:39.720 --> 2:50:45.040
 on amphetamine, or, you know, on, like we found it like decoupling of the default mode

2:50:45.040 --> 2:50:51.040
 network on Salvin or an A, which is a smokable psychedelic, which is a non classic psychedelic,

2:50:51.040 --> 2:50:55.320
 but another one where like DMT, where people are often talking to entities and that type

2:50:55.320 --> 2:50:59.040
 of thing, that was a really fun study to run. But nonetheless, most people say it's not

2:50:59.040 --> 2:51:04.480
 a classic psychedelic and doesn't have some, some, some of those phenomenal features that

2:51:04.480 --> 2:51:11.080
 people report from classic psychedelics and not sort of the clear sort of ego loss type,

2:51:11.080 --> 2:51:14.280
 not at least not in the way that people report it with classic psychedelics. So you get it

2:51:14.280 --> 2:51:19.040
 with all these different drugs. And so, and then you also see just broad, broad changes

2:51:19.040 --> 2:51:25.080
 in network activity with other networks. And so I think that story took off a little

2:51:25.080 --> 2:51:31.120
 too soon, although, so I think in the story that the DMN, the default mode network relating

2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:36.000
 to the self, and I know some neuroscientists, it drives them crazy if you say that it's

2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:43.120
 the ego. But self referential processing, if you go that far, like, that was already

2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:49.520
 known before psychedelics. Psychedelics didn't really contribute to that, the idea

2:51:49.520 --> 2:51:58.520
 that this type of brain network activity was related to a sense of self. But it is absolutely

2:51:58.520 --> 2:52:02.840
 striking that psychedelics that people report with pretty high reliability, these unity

2:52:02.840 --> 2:52:09.520
 experiences that where people subjectively like, like they report losing or getting like

2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:14.880
 the boundaries of the however you want to say it, like, like these, these unity experiences,

2:52:14.880 --> 2:52:19.240
 I think we can do a lot with that in terms of figuring out the nature of the sense of

2:52:19.240 --> 2:52:24.600
 self. Now, I don't think that's the same as the hard problem or, or the existence of

2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:28.800
 phenomenal consciousness, because you can build an AI system, and you correct me if I'm wrong,

2:52:28.800 --> 2:52:36.680
 that like, will pass a turing test in terms of demonstrating the qualities of like a sense

2:52:36.680 --> 2:52:40.640
 of self, it will talk as if there's a self, and there's probably a certain like algorithm

2:52:40.640 --> 2:52:47.760
 or whatever, like computational like, you know, scaling up of computations that results

2:52:47.760 --> 2:52:53.640
 in somehow. And I think this is the argument with, with humans, with some have speculated

2:52:53.640 --> 2:52:58.080
 this, why do we have this illusion of the self that's, that's evolved that, and we might

2:52:58.080 --> 2:53:04.880
 find this with AI that like, it works, you know, having a sense of self, or in that state

2:53:04.880 --> 2:53:13.800
 at wrong incorrectly, like, acting as if there is a, an agent at play and damage behaviorally

2:53:13.800 --> 2:53:18.800
 acting like, you know, there is a, there is a self that might kind of work. And so you

2:53:18.800 --> 2:53:27.440
 can program a computer or a robot to basically demonstrate, have an algorithm like that and

2:53:27.440 --> 2:53:31.520
 demonstrate that type of behavior. And I think that's completely silent on whether there's

2:53:31.520 --> 2:53:33.480
 an actual experience inside there.

2:53:33.480 --> 2:53:38.720
 I've been struggling to find the right words and how I feel about that whole thing. But

2:53:38.720 --> 2:53:44.720
 because I've said it poorly before, I've before said that there's no difference between the

2:53:44.720 --> 2:53:52.280
 appearance and the actual existence of consciousness or intelligence or any of that. What I really

2:53:52.280 --> 2:54:01.360
 mean is the, the more the appearance starts to be look like the thing, the more there's

2:54:01.360 --> 2:54:10.760
 this area where it's like, I don't think I don't, our whole idea of what is real and

2:54:10.760 --> 2:54:18.840
 what is just an illusion is not the right way to think about it. So the whole idea is like,

2:54:18.840 --> 2:54:26.240
 if you create a system that looks like it's having fun, the more it's realistically able

2:54:26.240 --> 2:54:32.720
 to portray itself as having fun, like there's a certain gray area at which it's the system

2:54:32.720 --> 2:54:37.640
 is having fun. And say with intelligence, same with consciousness, and we humans want

2:54:37.640 --> 2:54:44.120
 to simplify, like it feels like the way we simplified the existence and the illusion

2:54:44.120 --> 2:54:51.680
 of something is missing the whole truth of the nature of reality, which we're not yet

2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:56.320
 able to understand. Like it's the 1% we only understand 1% currently. So we don't have

2:54:56.320 --> 2:55:00.680
 the right physics to talk about things. We don't have the right science to talk about

2:55:00.680 --> 2:55:12.160
 things. But to me, like the faking it and actually being true is the difference is much

2:55:12.160 --> 2:55:17.720
 smaller than when humans would like to imagine. That's my intuition. But philosophers hate

2:55:17.720 --> 2:55:26.120
 that because, and guess what? It's philosophers. What have you actually built? So like to me

2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:31.160
 is that's the difference in philosophy and engineering. It feels like if we push the

2:55:31.160 --> 2:55:36.080
 creation, the engineering, like fake it until you make it all the way, which is like fake

2:55:36.080 --> 2:55:42.200
 consciousness until you realize holy crap, this thing is conscious, fake intelligence

2:55:42.200 --> 2:55:48.320
 until you realize holy crap, this intelligence. And from the, the my curiosity was psychedelics

2:55:48.320 --> 2:55:55.960
 and just neurobiology, neuroscience is like, it feels I'm, I love the armchair. I love

2:55:55.960 --> 2:56:00.260
 sitting in that armchair because it feels like at a certain point you're going to think

2:56:00.260 --> 2:56:06.400
 about this problem and there's going to be an aha moment. Like that's what the armchair

2:56:06.400 --> 2:56:14.520
 does. Sometimes science prevents you from really thinking, wait, like it's really simple.

2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:21.000
 There's something really simple. Like there's some, there could be some dance of chemicals

2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:26.640
 that we're totally unaware of, not from, not from aspects of like which chemicals to combine

2:56:26.640 --> 2:56:33.720
 with which biological architectures, but more like we were thinking of it completely wrong

2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:42.400
 that just out of the blue, like maybe the human mind is just like a radio that tunes

2:56:42.400 --> 2:56:48.800
 into some other medium where consciousness actually exists. Like those weird sort of

2:56:48.800 --> 2:56:53.520
 hypothetical, like maybe we're just thinking about the human mind totally wrong. Maybe

2:56:53.520 --> 2:56:58.960
 there's no such thing as individual intelligence. Maybe it is all collective intelligence between

2:56:58.960 --> 2:57:05.600
 humans. Like maybe the intelligence is possessed in the communication of language between minds

2:57:05.600 --> 2:57:12.000
 and then in fact consciousness is a property of that language versus a property of the

2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:18.880
 individual minds. And somehow the neurotransmitters will be able to connect to that so then AI systems

2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:23.880
 can join that common collective intelligence, that common language. You know, like just

2:57:23.880 --> 2:57:27.600
 thinking completely outside of the box. I just said a much crazy thing. I don't know, but

2:57:27.600 --> 2:57:34.040
 thinking outside the box and there's something about subtle manipulation of the chemicals

2:57:34.040 --> 2:57:42.500
 of the brain which feels like the best or one of the great chances of the scientific

2:57:42.500 --> 2:57:46.960
 process leading us to an actual understanding of the hard problem.

2:57:46.960 --> 2:57:53.320
 So I am very hopeful that and so I, I mean, I'm a radical empiricist, which I'm very strong

2:57:53.320 --> 2:57:58.400
 with with that. Like that's what, you know, so, you know, science isn't about ultimately

2:57:58.400 --> 2:58:03.040
 being a materialist. It's like, it's about being an empiricist in my view. And so for

2:58:03.040 --> 2:58:07.160
 example, I'm very fascinated by the so called sci phenomenon, you know, like stuff that

2:58:07.160 --> 2:58:12.800
 people just kind of reject out of hand. You know, I kind of orient towards that stuff

2:58:12.800 --> 2:58:18.440
 with an idea of, you know, hey, look, you know, what we consider like anything exists

2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:25.160
 is natural. And so, but the boundary of what we observe in nature, like what we recognize

2:58:25.160 --> 2:58:29.640
 as in nature moves, like what we do today and what we know today would only be described

2:58:29.640 --> 2:58:35.040
 as magic 500 years ago or even 100 years ago, some of it. So there will surely be things

2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:40.520
 that like you explained these phenomena that just sound like completely soup, they're supernatural

2:58:40.520 --> 2:58:44.400
 now where there may be for some of it, like some of it might turn out to be a complete

2:58:44.400 --> 2:58:49.400
 bunk and some of it might turn out to be it's just another layer of nature, whether we're

2:58:49.400 --> 2:58:52.800
 talking about multiple dimensions that are invoked or something we don't even have the

2:58:52.800 --> 2:58:57.680
 language towards. And what you're saying about the moving together of the model and

2:58:57.680 --> 2:59:01.480
 the real thing of consciousness, like, I'm very sympathetic to that. So that's that part

2:59:01.480 --> 2:59:06.240
 of like on the armshare side where I want to be clear, I can't say this as a scientist,

2:59:06.240 --> 2:59:14.200
 but just in terms of speculating, I find myself attracted to these more of the sort of the

2:59:14.200 --> 2:59:18.160
 panpsychism ideas. And that kind of makes sense to me. I don't know if that's what

2:59:18.160 --> 2:59:26.240
 you meant there, but seemed like related the sense that ultimately, if you were completely

2:59:26.240 --> 2:59:33.120
 modeling, unless you dismiss the idea that there is a phenomenal consciousness, which

2:59:33.120 --> 2:59:38.120
 I think is hard given that I seem like I have one that's really all I know, but if that's

2:59:38.120 --> 2:59:45.960
 so compelling, I can't just dismiss that. If you take that as a given, then the only

2:59:45.960 --> 2:59:54.800
 way for the model and the real thing to merge is if there is something baked into the nature

2:59:54.800 --> 2:59:59.280
 of reality sort of like in the history of like they're certain just like fundamental

2:59:59.280 --> 3:00:04.200
 forces or fundamental like in that and that's been useful for us. And sometimes we find

3:00:04.200 --> 3:00:08.720
 out that that's pointing towards something else or sometimes it's still seems like it's

3:00:08.720 --> 3:00:11.600
 a fundamental and sometimes it's a placeholder for somewhere forget, but there's something

3:00:11.600 --> 3:00:16.680
 like this is just a given. This is just and sometimes I'm like gravity seems like a very

3:00:16.680 --> 3:00:22.040
 good placeholder than there's something better that comes to replace it. So I kind of think

3:00:22.040 --> 3:00:25.600
 about like consciousness and I didn't I kind of had this inclination for I knew there was

3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:32.680
 a term for it, Rosalian monism, the idea that which is a form of pain again, I'm not I'm

3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:38.080
 an armchair philosopher, not a very good one, broadly panpsychism, by the way, is the idea

3:00:38.080 --> 3:00:44.680
 that sort of consciousness permeates all matter in or it's a fundamental part of physics of

3:00:44.680 --> 3:00:48.720
 the universe kind of thing. So right, this is the and there's a lot of different flavors

3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:53.440
 of it as you're as you're alluding to. And something that struck me as like consistent

3:00:53.440 --> 3:01:02.200
 with some just, you know, inclinations of mind just total speculation is this idea of

3:01:02.200 --> 3:01:07.160
 everything we know in science and with most of the stuff we think of physics, you know,

3:01:07.160 --> 3:01:15.080
 really describes it's all interactions. It's not the thing itself. Like there's a there

3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:21.880
 is something to this. And this sounds very new agey, which is why it's very difficult

3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:27.160
 and I had a high bullshit like meter and everything. But like an isness, I mean, I think about

3:01:27.160 --> 3:01:31.160
 like Huxley all this Huxley with his mescaline experience and doors of procession, like there's

3:01:31.160 --> 3:01:38.320
 an isness there and you know, Alan Watson, like there is a nature of being again, very

3:01:38.320 --> 3:01:43.560
 new agey sounding, but maybe there is something to in and when we say consciousness, we think

3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:50.000
 of like this human experience. But maybe that's just that's so processed and so that's so

3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:55.200
 far so derivative of this kind of basic thing that we wouldn't even recognize the basic

3:01:55.200 --> 3:02:00.600
 thing. But the basic thing might just be this is not about the interaction between particles.

3:02:00.600 --> 3:02:08.160
 This is what it is like to exist as a particle. And maybe it's not even particles, maybe it's

3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:12.880
 like space time itself. I mean, again, totally in the speculation and something out of space

3:02:12.880 --> 3:02:17.200
 time. So it's funny because we don't have this neither the science nor the proper language

3:02:17.200 --> 3:02:23.920
 to talk about it. All we have is kind of little intuitions about there might be something

3:02:23.920 --> 3:02:29.360
 in that direction of the darkness, right to pursue. And that that in that sense, I find

3:02:29.360 --> 3:02:37.000
 panpsychism interesting in that like, it does feel like there's something fundamental here,

3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:42.080
 the consciousness is not just like, okay, so the flip side consciousness could be just

3:02:42.080 --> 3:02:50.640
 a very basic and trivial symptom, like like a little hack of nature that's useful for

3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:59.640
 like survival of an organism. It's not something fundamental. It's just this very basic, boring

3:02:59.640 --> 3:03:04.800
 chemical thing that somehow has convinced us humans because we're very human centric

3:03:04.800 --> 3:03:09.400
 for very self centric, that this is somehow really important, but it's actually pretty

3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:15.400
 obvious. But or it could be something really fundamental to the nature of the universe.

3:03:15.400 --> 3:03:21.800
 So both of those are to me pretty compelling. And I think eventually scientifically testable,

3:03:21.800 --> 3:03:26.400
 it is so frustrating that it's hard to design scientific experiment currently. But I think

3:03:26.400 --> 3:03:33.440
 it's that's how noble prizes are won is nobody did it until they do it.

3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:40.240
 The reason I lean towards and again, armchair spec, if I had to bet like $1,000 on which

3:03:40.240 --> 3:03:43.960
 one of these ultimately be proved, I would, I would head, you know, would lean towards

3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:50.440
 and put my bets on, on something like panpsychism rather than the, the emergence of phenomenal

3:03:50.440 --> 3:03:58.080
 con consciousness through complexity or computational complexity, because although certainly what

3:03:58.080 --> 3:04:03.600
 that, if there is some underlying fundamental consciousness, it's clearly being processed

3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:09.520
 and you know, in this way, you go through computation in terms of resulting in our experience

3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:13.320
 and the experience presumably of other animals. But the reason I would bet on panpsychism

3:04:13.320 --> 3:04:19.760
 is to me, Occam's razor, it just in terms of truly the hard problem, like this at some

3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:24.760
 point you have an inside looking out and even looking refers to vision and it doesn't, that's

3:04:24.760 --> 3:04:31.800
 just an exit, you know, but just there's an inside experiencing something at some point

3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:36.480
 of complexity. All of a sudden, you know, you start from this objective universe and

3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:40.280
 all we know about is interactions between things and things happen. And at this certain

3:04:40.280 --> 3:04:47.840
 level of complexity, magically, there's an inside that to me doesn't pass Occam's razor

3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:54.040
 as easily as maybe there is a fundamental property of the universe of, you know, there's

3:04:54.040 --> 3:05:01.200
 both subjective and objective, there's both interactions amongst things and there is the

3:05:01.200 --> 3:05:03.240
 thing itself. Yes.

3:05:03.240 --> 3:05:04.240
 But yeah.

3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:09.320
 So I'm of two minds. I agree with you totally on half of my mind and the other half is I've

3:05:09.320 --> 3:05:16.080
 seen looking at cellular automata a lot, which is complete, it sure does seem that we don't

3:05:16.080 --> 3:05:22.600
 understand anything about complexity, like the emergence, just the property. In fact,

3:05:22.600 --> 3:05:28.760
 that could be a fundamental property of reality is something within the emergence from simple

3:05:28.760 --> 3:05:35.520
 things interacting somehow miraculous things happen. And like that, I don't understand

3:05:35.520 --> 3:05:45.240
 that, that could be that could be fundamental that like something about the layers of abstraction,

3:05:45.240 --> 3:05:51.560
 like layers of reality, like really small things interacting and then on another layer

3:05:51.560 --> 3:05:57.200
 emerges actual complicated behavior, even on the underlying things, super simple. Like

3:05:57.200 --> 3:06:02.000
 that process, we don't really don't understand either. And that could be bigger than any

3:06:02.000 --> 3:06:07.920
 of the things we're talking about. That's the basic force behind everything that's

3:06:07.920 --> 3:06:16.640
 happening in the universe is from simple things, complex phenomena can happen.

3:06:16.640 --> 3:06:25.280
 And the thing that gives me pause is that I'm concerned about a threshold there. Like,

3:06:25.280 --> 3:06:29.720
 how is it likely that now there may be and there may be some qualitative shift that in

3:06:29.720 --> 3:06:33.240
 the realm of like, we don't even we don't even understand complexity yet, like you're

3:06:33.240 --> 3:06:37.920
 saying, like, so maybe there is. But I do think like, if it if it is a result of the

3:06:37.920 --> 3:06:43.560
 complexity, well, you know, just having helium versus hydrogen is a form of complexity, having

3:06:43.560 --> 3:06:48.080
 the existence of stars versus clouds of gases of complexity, the the the entire universe

3:06:48.080 --> 3:06:53.080
 has been this increasing complexity. And so that kind of brings me back to then the other

3:06:53.080 --> 3:06:59.400
 of like, okay, if there's, if it's about complexity, then we should then it exists at a certain

3:06:59.400 --> 3:07:05.440
 level in these simple systems like a star, or, or, you know, they all have a kind of

3:07:05.440 --> 3:07:12.200
 panpsychism, that's right. But we humans, the qualitative shift, we might have evolved

3:07:12.200 --> 3:07:17.440
 to appreciate certain kinds of thresholds, right? Yeah, I do think it's likely that this

3:07:17.440 --> 3:07:21.320
 idea that whether or not there's an inner experience, which is phenomenal, it's the

3:07:21.320 --> 3:07:27.800
 hard problem that acting like an agent, like having an algorithm that basically like operates

3:07:27.800 --> 3:07:33.400
 as if there is an agent, that's clearly a thing that I think has worked. And that there

3:07:33.400 --> 3:07:39.720
 is a whole lot to figure out there that that and I think psychedelics will be extremely

3:07:39.720 --> 3:07:46.280
 helpful in figuring more out about that, because they do seem to a lot of times eliminate

3:07:46.280 --> 3:07:50.880
 that, or whatever, radically shift that sense of, of self.

3:07:50.880 --> 3:07:57.280
 Let me ask the craziest question. Indulge me for a second. Oh, this is a joke.

3:07:57.280 --> 3:08:04.400
 What we've been talking about, like, okay, no, all of this is a sign. All of that, despite

3:08:04.400 --> 3:08:09.720
 the caveats about armchair, I think is within the reach of science. Let me, let me ask one

3:08:09.720 --> 3:08:15.320
 that's kind of also within the reach of science, but as Joe likes to say, it's entirely possible,

3:08:15.320 --> 3:08:25.040
 right? Is it possible that with these DMT trips, when you meet entities, is it possible

3:08:25.040 --> 3:08:32.480
 that these entities are extraterrestrial life forms? Like our understanding of little

3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:38.640
 green men with aliens that show up is totally off. I often think about this, like what would

3:08:38.640 --> 3:08:46.760
 actual extraterrestrial intelligence look like? And my sense is it will look like very

3:08:46.760 --> 3:08:51.600
 different from anything we can even begin to comprehend.

3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:53.920
 And how would it communicate? And how would it communicate?

3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:58.000
 Would it be necessarily spaceships? Would there still a travel or could it be communicating

3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:04.600
 through chemicals, through, if there's the panpsychism situation, if there's something

3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:10.760
 not if? I almost for sure know we don't understand, you know, a lot about the function of our

3:09:10.760 --> 3:09:17.280
 mind in connection to the fabric of the physics in the universe. A lot of people seem to think

3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:22.400
 we have theoretical physics pretty figured out. I have my doubts, because I'm pretty

3:09:22.400 --> 3:09:25.440
 sure it always feels like we have everything figured out until we don't.

3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:30.680
 Right. I mean, there's no grand unifying theory yet, right? I mean, that's been widely recognized.

3:09:30.680 --> 3:09:36.160
 We could be missing out, like the concept of the universe just can be completely off.

3:09:36.160 --> 3:09:42.360
 Like how many other universes are there? All those kinds of things. I mean, just the basic

3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:50.520
 nature of information, the time, all those things. Yeah, whether that's just like a thing

3:09:50.520 --> 3:09:56.480
 we assign value to or whether it's fundamental or not, that's the whole chunk. I can talk

3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:01.360
 to the chunker forever about whether time is emergent or fundamental to the reality.

3:10:01.360 --> 3:10:07.200
 But is it possible that the entities we meet are actual alien life forms? Do you ever think

3:10:07.200 --> 3:10:08.200
 about that?

3:10:08.200 --> 3:10:14.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do. To some degree, I laid my cards out by identifying as a radical

3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:20.820
 empiricist. So the answer, is it possible? And I think ultimately, if you're a good

3:10:20.820 --> 3:10:27.000
 scientist, you got to say, now that's at the extremes, it's a yes. And it might get more

3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:31.960
 interesting when you're asked to guess about the probability of that. Is that a one in

3:10:31.960 --> 3:10:41.080
 a million, one in a trillion, one in more than the number of atoms in the universe probability?

3:10:41.080 --> 3:10:46.560
 And as an empiricist, what is a good testable? How would you know the answer to that question?

3:10:46.560 --> 3:10:48.920
 Well, how would you be able to validate it?

3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:57.120
 Well, can you get some information that's verifiable, like information about some other

3:10:57.120 --> 3:11:05.080
 planet or some aspect? And gosh, it would be an interesting range, but what range of discovery

3:11:05.080 --> 3:11:13.720
 that we can anticipate we're going to know within a few years, next 5, 10, 20 years,

3:11:13.720 --> 3:11:20.400
 and seeing if you can get that information now and then over time, it might be verified.

3:11:20.400 --> 3:11:25.600
 The type of thing like part of Einstein's work was ultimately verified not until decades

3:11:25.600 --> 3:11:30.840
 and decades later, at least certain aspects through empirical observations.

3:11:30.840 --> 3:11:37.080
 But it's also possible that the alien beings have a very different value system and perception

3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:42.560
 of the world where all of this little capitalistic improvements that we're all after, like predicting

3:11:42.560 --> 3:11:52.880
 the concept of predicting the future to is totally useless to other life forms that perhaps

3:11:52.880 --> 3:11:59.000
 think in a much different way, maybe a more transcendent way, I don't know.

3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:03.080
 So they wouldn't even sign the consent form to be a participant in our experiment.

3:12:03.080 --> 3:12:10.640
 That would not. And they wouldn't understand the nature of these experiments. I mean,

3:12:10.640 --> 3:12:18.040
 maybe it's purely in the realm of the consciousness thing that we talked about. So communicating

3:12:18.040 --> 3:12:23.320
 in a way that is totally different than the kinds of communication that we think of as

3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:30.200
 out on Earth. What's the purpose of communication for us? For us humans, the purpose of communication

3:12:30.200 --> 3:12:38.440
 is sharing ideas, it feels like, like converging. It's the Dawkins, like memes. It's like we're

3:12:38.440 --> 3:12:45.120
 sharing ideas in order to figure out how to collaborate together to get food into our

3:12:45.120 --> 3:12:51.640
 systems and procreate and then murder everybody in the neighboring tribe because they'll steal

3:12:51.640 --> 3:12:59.080
 our food. We are all about sharing ideas. Maybe it's possible to have another alien

3:12:59.080 --> 3:13:06.040
 life form that's more about sharing experiences. It's less about ideas, I don't know.

3:13:06.040 --> 3:13:09.960
 And maybe that'll be us in a few years. How could it not? Instead of explaining something

3:13:09.960 --> 3:13:14.960
 laboriously to you, like having people to describe the ineffable psychedelic experience,

3:13:14.960 --> 3:13:20.640
 if we could record that and then get the neural link of 50 years from now, like, oh, just plug

3:13:20.640 --> 3:13:21.640
 this into your...

3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:22.640
 To just transfer in the experiences?

3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:27.520
 Yeah. It's like, oh, now you feel what it's like. In one sense, how could we not go there?

3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:30.680
 And then you get into the realm, especially when you throw time into it, are the aliens

3:13:30.680 --> 3:13:38.440
 us in the future? Or even like a transcendental temporal, like the us beyond time? You get

3:13:38.440 --> 3:13:44.400
 into this realm and there's a lot of possibilities. Yeah. But I think there's one psychedelic

3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:52.440
 researcher who did high dose DMT research in the 90s who speculated that in there was

3:13:52.440 --> 3:13:59.520
 a lot of alien encounter experiences, like maybe these are entities from some other dimension.

3:13:59.520 --> 3:14:01.720
 He labeled it as speculation, but...

3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:03.320
 Do you remember the name?

3:14:03.320 --> 3:14:04.720
 Oh, Rick Strossman.

3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:05.720
 Oh, Rick Strossman.

3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:12.720
 Yeah, the DMT work. He labeled it as speculation, but I think that, yeah, I think it's a bit

3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:21.280
 of... Yeah, I think we'd be wise to kind of... It's always that balance between being empirically

3:14:21.280 --> 3:14:26.440
 grounded and skeptical, but also not being... And I think in science, well, often we are

3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:31.880
 too closed, which relates to like you're talking about Elon. Like in academia, it's like often...

3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:35.400
 I think you're punished for thinking or even talking about 20 years from now because it's

3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:42.040
 just so far removed from your next grant or for your next paper that it's easy pickings.

3:14:42.040 --> 3:14:45.200
 And that you're not allowed to speculate, so...

3:14:45.200 --> 3:14:53.560
 I'm a huge fan of... I think the best way to me at least to practice science or to practice

3:14:53.560 --> 3:15:00.680
 good engineering is to do two things and just bounce off... Spend most of the time doing

3:15:00.680 --> 3:15:05.600
 the rigor of the day to day of what can be accomplished. Now, in the engineering space

3:15:05.600 --> 3:15:12.020
 or in the science, what can you construct an experiment around? Do like that. The usual

3:15:12.020 --> 3:15:17.640
 rigor of the scientific process, but then every once in a while on a regular basis to

3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:25.320
 step outside and talk about aliens and consciousness. And we just walk along the line of things

3:15:25.320 --> 3:15:33.800
 that are outside the reach of science currently. Free will, the illusion or the perception

3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:41.080
 of the experience of free will of anything, just the entirety of it being able to travel

3:15:41.080 --> 3:15:46.360
 in time through warm holes. It's like it's really useful to do that, especially as a

3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:53.040
 scientist. Like if that's all you do, you go into a land where you're not actually able

3:15:53.040 --> 3:15:58.240
 to think rigorously. There's something, at least to me, that if you just hop back and

3:15:58.240 --> 3:16:06.280
 forth, you're able to, I think, do exactly the kind of injection of out of the box thinking

3:16:06.280 --> 3:16:12.280
 to your regular day to day science that will ultimately lead to breakthroughs. But you

3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:14.920
 have to be the good scientist most of the time.

3:16:14.920 --> 3:16:21.080
 And that's consistent with what I think the great scientists of history. Like in most

3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:30.640
 of the history, the greats, the Newtons and Einstein's, I mean, there was less of it,

3:16:30.640 --> 3:16:34.120
 and this change, I think, is time marched on, but less of a separation between those

3:16:34.120 --> 3:16:41.320
 realms. It's like there's the inclination now for it as a scientist. And this is like,

3:16:41.320 --> 3:16:45.400
 this is science, this is my work, and then this is like my inclination to say, oh, Lex,

3:16:45.400 --> 3:16:48.480
 don't take me too seriously because this is my armchair. I'm not speaking as a scientist.

3:16:48.480 --> 3:16:54.320
 I'm bending over backwards to say, to divide that self, and maybe there's been less of,

3:16:54.320 --> 3:17:01.800
 there's been that evolution. And the greats didn't see that. I mean, and you go back in

3:17:01.800 --> 3:17:05.880
 time, that obviously connects to then religion, especially if that is the predominant world

3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:13.000
 or Newton. How much time did he spend trying to decode the Bible and whatnot? Maybe that

3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:18.560
 was a dead end. But it's like, if you really believe in that, in that particular religion,

3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:23.200
 and you're this mastermind, and you're trying to figure things out, it's not like, oh, this

3:17:23.200 --> 3:17:26.960
 is what my job description is, and this is what the grant wants. It's like, no, I've

3:17:26.960 --> 3:17:31.240
 got this limited time on the planet. I'm going to figure out as much stuff as possible. Nothing

3:17:31.240 --> 3:17:35.800
 is off the table, and you're just putting it all together. So this is kind of this trajectory

3:17:35.800 --> 3:17:42.560
 is really related to the siloing in science. Again, related to my like, oh, I'm not a philosopher,

3:17:42.560 --> 3:17:48.640
 whether you consider science or not, not empirical science, but like going to these different

3:17:48.640 --> 3:17:54.320
 disciplines, like the greats didn't observe the boundaries didn't exist, they didn't

3:17:54.320 --> 3:17:55.320
 observe them.

3:17:55.320 --> 3:18:06.160
 Yeah. So speaking of the finiteness of our existence in this world, so on the front

3:18:06.160 --> 3:18:12.640
 of psychedelics and teaching you lessons as a researcher, as a human being, what have

3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:18.560
 you learned about death, about mortality, about the finiteness of our existence? Are

3:18:18.560 --> 3:18:26.240
 you yourself afraid of death? And how has your view, do you ponder it? And has your

3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:30.640
 view of your mortality changed with the research you've done?

3:18:30.640 --> 3:18:33.640
 Yeah. Yeah. So I do ponder it and...

3:18:33.640 --> 3:18:35.560
 Are you afraid of death?

3:18:35.560 --> 3:18:41.320
 Probably on a daily basis I ponder it. I would, I'd have to pick it apart more and say, yeah,

3:18:41.320 --> 3:18:48.960
 I am afraid of dying, like the process of dying. I'm not afraid of being dead. I mean,

3:18:48.960 --> 3:18:52.920
 I'm not afraid of, I think it was Penn Gillette that said, and he may have gotten it from

3:18:52.920 --> 3:18:58.960
 someone else, but like, I'm not afraid of the year 1862 before I existed. I'm not afraid

3:18:58.960 --> 3:19:06.640
 of the year 2262 after I'm gone, like, it's going to be fine. But yeah, dying, like, I'd

3:19:06.640 --> 3:19:13.040
 be lying if I said I wasn't afraid of dying. And so there's both, like, the process of

3:19:13.040 --> 3:19:18.640
 dying, like, yeah, it's usually not good. It'd be nice if it was after many, many years

3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:23.800
 and just sort of, you know, I'd rather not fall, you know, die in my sleep. I'd rather

3:19:23.800 --> 3:19:28.600
 kind of be conscious, but sort of just fade out with old age maybe. But like, you know,

3:19:28.600 --> 3:19:33.280
 just being in an accident and like, horrible diseases, I've seen enough loved ones, it's

3:19:33.280 --> 3:19:39.320
 like, yeah, this is not good. This is enough to be, you know, I'd like to say that I'm

3:19:39.320 --> 3:19:42.360
 peaceful and sort of balanced enough that I'm not concerned at all. But no, like, yeah,

3:19:42.360 --> 3:19:49.600
 I'm afraid of dying. But I'm also concerned about, I think about family, like, I'm really,

3:19:49.600 --> 3:19:55.960
 I'm afraid or at least, you know, concerned about, like, not being there, like with a

3:19:55.960 --> 3:20:02.760
 three year old, not being there, not being there for him and my wife and my mom the rest

3:20:02.760 --> 3:20:07.200
 of her life. I'm concerned about not, I'm concerned more about, like, the harm that

3:20:07.200 --> 3:20:11.920
 it would cause if I left prematurely. And then kind of even bigger along the lines of some

3:20:11.920 --> 3:20:17.320
 of the stuff that Ford think we've been talking about, I think maybe way too much about just

3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:23.520
 like, and I'll never know the answer. So even if I lived 120, like, but like, I want to

3:20:23.520 --> 3:20:28.960
 know as much as I can, but like, how is this going to work out, like, as humans? Are we

3:20:28.960 --> 3:20:32.920
 in a big one? I think it's, are we going to, and I don't think, unfortunately, I'm going

3:20:32.920 --> 3:20:38.840
 to learn it in my lifetime, even if I live to a ripe old age, but well, I don't know.

3:20:38.840 --> 3:20:39.840
 Is this going to work out?

3:20:39.840 --> 3:20:43.200
 Like, are we going to escape the planet? I think that's one of the biggies. Like, are

3:20:43.200 --> 3:20:47.320
 we going to like, the survival of the speed, like, I think the next, like the time we're

3:20:47.320 --> 3:20:53.680
 in now, it's like with the nuclear weapons, with pandemics, and with, I mean, we're going

3:20:53.680 --> 3:20:59.240
 to get to the point where anyone can, can build a hydrogen bomb, like, you know, it's

3:20:59.240 --> 3:21:02.680
 like, you just like the, or engineer, like the, you know, something that's a million

3:21:02.680 --> 3:21:06.560
 times worse than COVID and then just spread it. It's like, we're getting to this period

3:21:06.560 --> 3:21:09.480
 of, and then not, you know, not to mention climate change, you know, it's like, although

3:21:09.480 --> 3:21:13.800
 I think that's not, there's probably going to be surviving humans with that regard,

3:21:13.800 --> 3:21:18.680
 you know, but it could be really bad. But these existential threats, I think the only

3:21:18.680 --> 3:21:23.960
 real guarantee that we're going to get another, you name it, 1000 million, whatever years

3:21:23.960 --> 3:21:31.760
 is like diversity, diversifier portfolio, get off the planet, you know, don't leave

3:21:31.760 --> 3:21:36.920
 this one, hopefully we keep, you know, but like, and I, you know, it's like either we're

3:21:36.920 --> 3:21:43.440
 going to get snuffed out, like really quickly, or we're going to like, if we, if we reach

3:21:43.440 --> 3:21:48.120
 that point, and it's going to be over the next like 100, 200 years, like, like, we're

3:21:48.120 --> 3:21:54.360
 probably going to survive like, like until like, I mean, you know, like our son, like

3:21:54.360 --> 3:21:57.960
 even beyond that, like, like, we're probably going to be talking about millions and millions

3:21:57.960 --> 3:22:03.120
 of years. It's like, and we're, we're, I don't know, in terms of the planet, 4 billion years

3:22:03.120 --> 3:22:07.640
 into this. And depending on how you count our species, you know, we're, you know, we're

3:22:07.640 --> 3:22:11.360
 millions of years into this. And it's like, it's just like the point of the rear relay

3:22:11.360 --> 3:22:13.840
 race where we can really screw up.

3:22:13.840 --> 3:22:19.200
 So that would make you feel pretty good when you're on your death bed at 120 years old.

3:22:19.200 --> 3:22:24.840
 And there's something hopeful about, there's a colony starting up on Mars. And it's like,

3:22:24.840 --> 3:22:29.040
 yeah, Titan, like whatever, you know, like, yeah, like that we have these colonies out

3:22:29.040 --> 3:22:35.400
 there that would tell me like, yeah, then at least we'd be good until like the, you know,

3:22:35.400 --> 3:22:40.240
 hopefully probably until the, the, the sun goes red giant, you know what I mean?

3:22:40.240 --> 3:22:45.000
 Yeah. Rather than, oh, like 20 years from now, when there's some, someone with their

3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:50.760
 finger on the nuclear button that just, you know, misperceives, you know, the radar, you

3:22:50.760 --> 3:22:56.840
 know, like the signal they think Russia's attacking or really not, or China. And like,

3:22:56.840 --> 3:23:01.720
 that's probably how a nuclear accident war is going to start rather than, you know, or

3:23:01.720 --> 3:23:04.000
 the, like I said, these other horrible things.

3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:10.440
 Does it not make you sad that you won't be there if we are successful at proliferating

3:23:10.440 --> 3:23:17.280
 throughout the observable universe that you won't be there to experience any of it?

3:23:17.280 --> 3:23:18.280
 Yeah.

3:23:18.280 --> 3:23:22.560
 It's ego death, right? It's the death because you're still going to die and still going to

3:23:22.560 --> 3:23:23.560
 be over.

3:23:23.560 --> 3:23:24.560
 Right.

3:23:24.560 --> 3:23:32.520
 That's, you know, Ernest Becker and those folks really emphasize the terror of death

3:23:32.520 --> 3:23:37.240
 that if we're honest, we'll discover if we search within ourselves, which is like, this

3:23:37.240 --> 3:23:45.520
 thing is going to be over. Most of our existence is based on the illusion that it's going to

3:23:45.520 --> 3:23:51.920
 go forever. And when you sort of realize it's actually going to be over, like today, like

3:23:51.920 --> 3:23:56.000
 I might murder you at the end of this conversation.

3:23:56.000 --> 3:24:02.840
 And it might be over today or like you go on going home. This might be your last day

3:24:02.840 --> 3:24:13.120
 on this earth. And it's, I mean, like pondering that, I suppose, I suppose one thing to be

3:24:13.120 --> 3:24:22.400
 me, I, if I were to push back, it's interesting is you actually, I think you see comfort in

3:24:22.400 --> 3:24:28.760
 the sadness of how unfortunate it would be for your family to not have you. Because the

3:24:28.760 --> 3:24:35.520
 really even, even the deeper, yes, but that's the simple fear. Even the deeper terror is

3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:45.480
 like, like this, this thing doesn't last forever. Like I think, I don't know, they're like if

3:24:45.480 --> 3:24:52.560
 it's hard to put the right words to it, but it feels like that's not truly acknowledged

3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:55.600
 by us, by each of us.

3:24:55.600 --> 3:25:00.720
 Yeah. I think this is the, I mean, getting back to the psychedelics in terms of the people

3:25:00.720 --> 3:25:05.760
 and our work with cancer patients who we had psilocybin sessions to help them and it did

3:25:05.760 --> 3:25:11.880
 substantially help them, the vast majority, in terms of dealing with these existential

3:25:11.880 --> 3:25:16.320
 issues. And I think, you know, it's something we, I could say that I really feel that I've

3:25:16.320 --> 3:25:20.920
 come along and that both like being with folks who have died that are close to me and then

3:25:20.920 --> 3:25:26.880
 also that work, I think are the two biggies and sort of like, you know, I think I've come

3:25:26.880 --> 3:25:33.640
 along and that sort of acceptance of this, like, like it's not going to last any, whether

3:25:33.640 --> 3:25:36.960
 we're at the personal level or even at the species level, like at some point, all the

3:25:36.960 --> 3:25:40.160
 stars are going to fade out and it's going to be the realm of which is going to be the

3:25:40.160 --> 3:25:43.560
 vast majority if it can, unless there's a big crunch, which just apparently doesn't

3:25:43.560 --> 3:25:47.560
 seem likely, like most of the universe, there's this blink of an eye that's happening right

3:25:47.560 --> 3:25:52.240
 now that life is even possible, like the era of stars. So it's like, we're going to fade

3:25:52.240 --> 3:25:57.920
 out at some point, like, you know, and, you know, didn't we get at this level of consciousness

3:25:57.920 --> 3:26:02.280
 and like, okay, maybe there is life after death, maybe there's maybe times in illusion,

3:26:02.280 --> 3:26:07.680
 maybe we're like, that part I'm ready for, like, I'm, I'm like, you know, like, that,

3:26:07.680 --> 3:26:10.760
 that would be really great. And I'm looking, I'm not afraid of that at all. It's like,

3:26:10.760 --> 3:26:15.560
 even if it's just strange, like if I could push a button to enter that door, I mean,

3:26:15.560 --> 3:26:19.240
 I'm not going to, you know, die, you know, I can kill myself, but it's like, if I could

3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:24.000
 take a peek at what that reality is or choose at the end of my life, if I could choose of

3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:28.240
 entering into a universe where there is an afterlife of something completely unknown

3:26:28.240 --> 3:26:32.360
 versus one where there's none, I think I'd say, well, let's see what's behind that.

3:26:32.360 --> 3:26:36.520
 That's a true scientist way of thinking. If there's a door, you're excited about opening

3:26:36.520 --> 3:26:39.040
 it and going in. Right.

3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:44.440
 When I am attracted to this idea, like, you know, it's, and I recognize it's easier said

3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:49.320
 than done to say, I'm okay with not existing. It's like, the real test is like, okay, check

3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:53.760
 me on my deathbed. You know, it's like, it's, oh, it'll be all right. It's beautiful thing

3:26:53.760 --> 3:26:58.960
 and the humility of surrendering. And I really hope, and I think I'd probably be more likely

3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:04.400
 to be in that realm right now than I would like, or check me when I get a terminal cancer

3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:09.920
 diagnosis. And I really hope I'm more in that realm. But I, I know enough about human nature

3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:13.240
 to know that like, I don't want to, I can't really speak to that because I haven't been

3:27:13.240 --> 3:27:18.560
 in that situation. And I think there can be a beauty to that and the transcendence of

3:27:18.560 --> 3:27:24.360
 like, yeah, and you know, it was, it was beautiful, not just despite all that, but because of

3:27:24.360 --> 3:27:28.840
 that, because ultimately there's going to be nothing. And because we came from nothing

3:27:28.840 --> 3:27:32.440
 and we dealt with all this shit, the fact that there was still beauty and truth and

3:27:32.440 --> 3:27:40.080
 connection, like that, you know, like it just, it's a beautiful thing. But I hope I'm in

3:27:40.080 --> 3:27:44.280
 that. It's easy to say that now. Like, yeah.

3:27:44.280 --> 3:27:53.120
 Do you think there's a meaning to this thing we got going on life, existence on earth to

3:27:53.120 --> 3:28:01.280
 us individuals from a psychedelics researcher perspective or from just a human perspective?

3:28:01.280 --> 3:28:05.240
 Those merged together for me, because it's, it's just hard. I've been doing this research

3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:12.760
 for almost 17 years and like, not just the cancer study, but so many times people like,

3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:17.760
 I remember a session in this, in one of our studies, someone who wasn't getting any treatment

3:28:17.760 --> 3:28:22.080
 for anything, but one of our healthy normal studies where he was contemplating the, the

3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:28.600
 suicide of his son. And just these, I mean, just like the most intense human experiences

3:28:28.600 --> 3:28:35.920
 that you can have in the most vulnerable situations, sometimes like people, like, you know, and

3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:40.600
 it's just like, you have to have a, I mean, you just feel lucky to be part of that process

3:28:40.600 --> 3:28:44.040
 that people trust you to let their guards down like that.

3:28:44.040 --> 3:28:52.800
 Like, I don't know, the meaning, I think the meaning of life is, is, is defined meaning.

3:28:52.800 --> 3:28:57.000
 And I think, actually, I think I just described it a minute ago, it's like that transcendence

3:28:57.000 --> 3:29:04.480
 of everything, like the, it's the beauty despite the absolute ugliness, it's the, it's the,

3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:09.440
 and as a species, and I think more about this, like I think about this a lot, it's the fact

3:29:09.440 --> 3:29:18.800
 that we are, I mean, we're, we come from filth, I mean, we're, we're, you know, we're animals,

3:29:18.800 --> 3:29:26.600
 we come from, like, we're all descended from murderers and rapists, like we despite that

3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:27.600
 background.

3:29:27.600 --> 3:29:35.560
 We are capable of this, the self sacrifice and the connection and, and, and, and figuring

3:29:35.560 --> 3:29:40.920
 things out, you know, true science and other forms of truth, you know, seeking and, and

3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:45.480
 an artwork, just the beauty of, of, of music and, and other forms of art.

3:29:45.480 --> 3:29:51.720
 It's like the fact that that's possible is the meaning of, of life.

3:29:51.720 --> 3:30:00.120
 I mean, and ultimately that feels to be creating a more enricher experiences, the, from a Russian

3:30:00.120 --> 3:30:07.360
 perspective, both the dark, the, you mentioned the cancer diagnosis or losing a child to

3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:16.280
 suicide or all those dark things is, is still rich experiences and also the, the beautiful

3:30:16.280 --> 3:30:20.280
 creations, the art, the music, the science, that's also rich experience.

3:30:20.280 --> 3:30:25.720
 So somehow we're figuring out from just like psychedelics expand our mind to the possibility

3:30:25.720 --> 3:30:26.720
 of experiences.

3:30:26.720 --> 3:30:33.040
 Somehow we're able to figure out different ways of society to expand the realm of experiences

3:30:33.040 --> 3:30:34.960
 and from that we gain meaning somehow.

3:30:34.960 --> 3:30:35.960
 Right.

3:30:35.960 --> 3:30:38.480
 And that's part of like this, we're going across different levels here, but like the

3:30:38.480 --> 3:30:44.080
 idea that so called bad trips or challenging experiences are so common in psychedelic experiences.

3:30:44.080 --> 3:30:46.400
 It's like, that's a part of that.

3:30:46.400 --> 3:30:51.080
 Like, yeah, it's tough and most of the important things in life are really, really tough and

3:30:51.080 --> 3:30:52.080
 scary.

3:30:52.080 --> 3:30:56.640
 And most of the things like, like the death of a loved one, like it told, like the greatest

3:30:56.640 --> 3:31:01.480
 learning experiences and things that make you who you are are the horrors.

3:31:01.480 --> 3:31:05.200
 And you know, it's like, yeah, we try to minimize and we try to avoid them.

3:31:05.200 --> 3:31:08.800
 But and I don't know, I think we all need to get into the mode of like giving ourselves

3:31:08.800 --> 3:31:14.720
 a break both personally and society, societally, I mean, I went through like the, the, I think

3:31:14.720 --> 3:31:20.320
 a lot of people do these days in my twenties, like, oh, the humans are just kind of a disease

3:31:20.320 --> 3:31:22.440
 on the planet.

3:31:22.440 --> 3:31:25.440
 And then in terms of our country, in terms of the United States, it's like, oh, we have

3:31:25.440 --> 3:31:28.360
 all these horrible, you know, sins in our past.

3:31:28.360 --> 3:31:34.600
 And it's like, I think about that like the, I think about it like my three year olds,

3:31:34.600 --> 3:31:39.040
 like, yeah, you can construct a story where this is all just hard.

3:31:39.040 --> 3:31:43.600
 You can look at that stuff and say this is all just horror, you know, where you are.

3:31:43.600 --> 3:31:47.560
 There's like, there's no logical answer to our, you know, rational answer to say, we're

3:31:47.560 --> 3:31:54.880
 not a disease on the planet from one lens we are, you know, you know, and like there's

3:31:54.880 --> 3:31:58.520
 you could just look at humanity as that like nothing but this horrible thing you can look

3:31:58.520 --> 3:32:03.920
 at any you and you name the system, you know, oh, you know, modern medicine, Western medicine,

3:32:03.920 --> 3:32:08.000
 you know, the university system and it's like, you can dismiss everything as a, you know,

3:32:08.000 --> 3:32:11.440
 big font or like, hopefully these vaccines work and then like, yeah, I'd like to, you

3:32:11.440 --> 3:32:16.840
 know, like, I'm kind of glad the big pharma was a part of that, like, you know, it's like

3:32:16.840 --> 3:32:21.840
 the United States, you can like point to the horrors, like any other country that's been

3:32:21.840 --> 3:32:27.280
 around a long time that has these legitimate horrors and kind of dismiss like these beautiful

3:32:27.280 --> 3:32:34.000
 things like, yeah, we have this like modifiable constitutional republic that just like I still

3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:39.840
 think is the best thing going, you know, that that as a model system of like how humans

3:32:39.840 --> 3:32:45.520
 have to figure out how to work together, it's like it's how there's no better system that

3:32:45.520 --> 3:32:46.520
 I've come across.

3:32:46.520 --> 3:32:51.800
 Yeah, there's a, if we're willing to look for it, there's a, there's a beautiful court

3:32:51.800 --> 3:32:53.720
 to a lot of things we've created.

3:32:53.720 --> 3:32:59.400
 Yeah, this country is a great example of that, but most of the human experience has a has

3:32:59.400 --> 3:33:02.160
 a beauty to it, even the suffering.

3:33:02.160 --> 3:33:03.160
 Right.

3:33:03.160 --> 3:33:07.920
 So the meaning is fine is choosing to focus on that positivity and not forget it.

3:33:07.920 --> 3:33:08.920
 Beautifully put.

3:33:08.920 --> 3:33:14.000

 And now let me leave you with some words from Terence McKenna.

3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:13.080
 Nature loves courage.

3:34:13.080 --> 3:34:17.360
 You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible

3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:19.160
 obstacles.

3:34:19.160 --> 3:34:23.480
 Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under.

3:34:23.480 --> 3:34:25.040
 It will lift you up.

3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:26.400
 This is the trick.

3:34:26.400 --> 3:34:31.200
 This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the

3:34:31.200 --> 3:34:32.880
 alchemical gold.

3:34:32.880 --> 3:34:34.960
 This is what they understood.

3:34:34.960 --> 3:34:38.120
 This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.

3:34:38.120 --> 3:34:44.320
 This is how magic is done by hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather

3:34:44.320 --> 3:34:46.040
 bed.

3:34:46.040 --> 3:35:05.720
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
