00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
 The following is a conversation with Robert Cruz,

00:02.640 --> 00:06.560
 a historian at Stanford, specializing in the history

00:06.560 --> 00:09.800
 of Afghanistan, Russia, and Islam.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.040
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.040
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:14.040 --> 00:15.240
 in the description.

00:15.240 --> 00:19.020
 And now, here's my conversation with Robert Cruz.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.120
 Was it a mistake for the United States

00:22.120 --> 00:25.920
 to invade Afghanistan in 2001, 20 years ago?

00:25.920 --> 00:27.440
 Yes.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.440
 As simple as yes, why was it a mistake?

00:30.440 --> 00:33.680
 I'm a historian, so I say this with some humility

00:33.680 --> 00:35.080
 about what we can know.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.680
 I think I'd still like to know much more

00:36.680 --> 00:39.080
 about what was going on in the White House

00:39.080 --> 00:42.200
 in the hours, days, weeks after 9 11.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.320
 But I think the George W. Bush administration

00:45.320 --> 00:47.000
 acted in a state of panic.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.080
 And I think they wanted to show kind of toughness.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.880
 They wanted to show some kind of resolve.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.120
 This was a horrific act that played out

00:55.120 --> 00:57.360
 on everyone's television screens.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.040
 And I think it was really fundamentally a crisis

01:00.040 --> 01:01.640
 of legitimacy within the White House,

01:01.640 --> 01:02.480
 within the Oval Office.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.240
 And I think they felt like they had to do something

01:05.240 --> 01:06.680
 and something dramatic.

01:06.680 --> 01:10.160
 I think they didn't really think through who they were fighting,

01:10.160 --> 01:14.720
 who the enemy was, what this geography had to do with 9 11.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.240
 I think looking back at it, I mean, some of us,

01:17.240 --> 01:19.840
 not to say I was clairvoyant or could see into the future,

01:19.840 --> 01:22.400
 but I think many of us were, from that morning,

01:22.400 --> 01:24.320
 skeptical about the connections that people were drawing

01:24.320 --> 01:27.640
 between Afghanistan as a state, as a place,

01:27.640 --> 01:30.240
 and the actions of Al Qaeda in Washington

01:30.240 --> 01:33.080
 and New York and Pennsylvania.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.000
 So as you watch the events of 9 11,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.360
 the things that our leaders were saying

01:40.360 --> 01:44.840
 in the minutes, hours, days, weeks that followed,

01:44.840 --> 01:47.160
 maybe you can give a little bit of a timeline

01:47.160 --> 01:49.800
 of what was being said.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.440
 When was the actual invasion of Afghanistan?

01:52.440 --> 01:55.400
 And also, what were your feelings

01:55.400 --> 01:59.440
 in the minutes, weeks after 9 11?

01:59.440 --> 02:00.440
 I was in DC.

02:00.440 --> 02:04.200
 I was on the way to American University,

02:04.200 --> 02:07.280
 hearing on NPR what happened.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.600
 And I thought of the American University logo,

02:10.600 --> 02:11.800
 which is red, white, and blue.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.040
 It's an eagle.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.440
 And I thought, Washington is under attack

02:15.440 --> 02:18.680
 and symbols of American power are under attack.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.720
 And so I was quite concerned and at the time lived

02:22.720 --> 02:24.800
 just a few miles from the capital.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.400
 And so I felt that it was real.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.280
 So I appreciate the sense of anxiety and fear and panic.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.400
 And four, two, three years later in DC,

02:35.400 --> 02:38.680
 we were constantly getting reports, mostly rumors

02:38.680 --> 02:40.840
 and confirmed about all kinds of attacks

02:40.840 --> 02:41.680
 that would fall in the city.

02:41.680 --> 02:46.240
 So I definitely appreciate the sense of being under assault.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.440
 But in watching television, including Russian television

02:48.440 --> 02:51.240
 the other day, because I just installed a satellite thing.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.440
 So I was trying to watch world news

02:52.440 --> 02:53.440
 and get different points of view.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.360
 And that was quite useful to have an alternative set of eyes.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.160
 In Russian?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.440
 Yeah, in Russian, yeah.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.480
 OK, so your Russian is good enough

03:01.480 --> 03:03.160
 to understand Russian television.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.600
 The news, yeah, the news and the visuals that were coming

03:05.600 --> 03:07.600
 that were not shown on American television.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.840
 I don't know how they had it, but they

03:08.840 --> 03:11.720
 had they were not filtering anything in the way

03:11.720 --> 03:14.080
 that the major networks and cable television

03:14.080 --> 03:14.680
 were doing here.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.760
 So it was a very unvarnished view of the violence

03:17.760 --> 03:21.040
 of the moment in New York City of people diving

03:21.040 --> 03:24.280
 from the towers and it was really they didn't hold back

03:24.280 --> 03:26.160
 on that, which was quite fascinating.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.040
 I think much of the world saw much more than actually

03:28.040 --> 03:29.880
 the American public saw.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.800
 But to your question, amid that feeling of imminent doom,

03:33.800 --> 03:36.840
 I watched commentators start to talk about al Qaeda

03:36.840 --> 03:39.120
 and then talk about Afghanistan.

03:39.120 --> 03:43.720
 And one of the experts was Barnett Rubin, who's at NYU,

03:43.720 --> 03:48.400
 who's a kind of long, very learned Afghanistan hand.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.520
 And he's brought on Peter Jennings on ABC News

03:50.520 --> 03:53.760
 to kind of lay this out for everyone.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.320
 And I thought he did a fine job.

03:55.320 --> 03:59.080
 But I think it was formative in submitting the view that somehow

03:59.080 --> 04:02.400
 al Qaeda was synonymous with this space, Afghanistan.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.240
 And I think, again, I was no al Qaeda expert then,

04:06.240 --> 04:07.720
 and I'm not now.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.560
 But I think my immediate thought went to war

04:11.560 --> 04:13.760
 and because my background had been with,

04:13.760 --> 04:14.760
 at that point, mostly,

04:14.760 --> 04:17.720
 Afghans who had been displaced from decades of war,

04:17.720 --> 04:19.720
 who might encounter in Uzbekistan, who were refugees

04:19.720 --> 04:20.920
 and so on.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.080
 I thought immediately my mind went to the suffering

04:24.080 --> 04:28.280
 of Afghan people that this war was going to sweep up,

04:28.280 --> 04:30.000
 of course, the defenseless people

04:30.000 --> 04:31.400
 who have nothing to do with these politics.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.320
 So we should give maybe a little bit of context

04:33.320 --> 04:35.240
 that you can speak to.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.240
 So assume nobody's an expert in anything.

04:38.240 --> 04:43.320
 So let's just say you and I are not experts in anything.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.400
 What, as a historian, were you studying at the time

04:46.400 --> 04:52.200
 and thinking about, is it the full global history

04:52.200 --> 04:53.720
 of Afghanistan?

04:53.720 --> 04:56.440
 Is it the region where you're thinking

04:56.440 --> 05:01.760
 about the Mujahideen and al Qaeda and Taliban?

05:01.760 --> 05:04.200
 Were you thinking about the Soviet Union,

05:04.200 --> 05:06.600
 the proxy war through Afghanistan?

05:06.600 --> 05:09.880
 Were you thinking about Iraq and oil?

05:09.880 --> 05:12.760
 What's the full space of things in your heart,

05:12.760 --> 05:14.160
 in your mind at the time?

05:14.160 --> 05:15.560
 I mean, just at the moment, of course,

05:15.560 --> 05:19.480
 that's the sense of the suffering and the tragedy

05:19.480 --> 05:21.400
 of the moment of the deaths.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.320
 And that was, I think, I was preoccupied

05:23.320 --> 05:26.240
 by the violence at the moment.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.520
 But as the conversation turned to Afghanistan

05:28.520 --> 05:31.280
 as a kind of theater, to somehow respond to this moment,

05:31.280 --> 05:33.760
 I think immediately what came to mind was that the little I

05:33.760 --> 05:35.000
 knew about al Qaeda at the time,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.160
 that the geography was inaccurate,

05:38.160 --> 05:41.360
 that this was a global network, a global threat,

05:41.360 --> 05:45.280
 that this is a kind of a movement that went beyond borders.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.680
 And I think it felt early on that Afghanistan was

05:48.680 --> 05:50.320
 going to be used as a scapegoat.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.720
 And intellectually, at the time, I

05:51.720 --> 05:53.160
 was teaching at American University.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.360
 My course is touched on a range of subjects.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.360
 But I was trying to complete a book on Islam

05:59.360 --> 06:01.240
 and the Russian Empire, actually.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.080
 But in doing that research, which took me across Russia,

06:04.080 --> 06:06.560
 and Central Asia, purely by accident,

06:06.560 --> 06:08.520
 I had developed an interest in Afghanistan

06:08.520 --> 06:12.720
 because, again, a series of coincidences,

06:12.720 --> 06:15.280
 I found myself in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan,

06:15.280 --> 06:18.120
 without housing, doing an American friend who

06:18.120 --> 06:20.200
 was like the king of the market in Tashkent.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.440
 He knew everyone.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.440
 He run into some Afghan merchants there.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.480
 They found out I didn't have a place to live.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.280
 I didn't know where Afghanistan was, honestly.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.360
 This was 1997.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.600
 I had a vague idea it was next door.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.200
 Well, you lived in Uzbekistan?

06:32.200 --> 06:34.960
 Yeah, in Tashkent, doing decision research.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.880
 Because it was a hub of the Russian Empire in Central Asia.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.240
 So just by accident, I ended up with these young Afghans

06:40.240 --> 06:42.720
 who took me in as roommates.

06:42.720 --> 06:46.280
 And then I think that the sense of that community

06:46.280 --> 06:48.480
 shaped my idea of what Afghanistan is.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.160
 It was my first exposure to them.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.840
 They were part of a trading diaspora.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.440
 They had brought matches from Riga, Latvia.

06:57.440 --> 07:01.240
 They had somehow brought flour and some agricultural products

07:01.240 --> 07:02.840
 from Egypt.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.520
 And they were sitting in closed containers in Tashkent

07:06.520 --> 07:09.920
 waiting for these Pakistani state to permit them to trade.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.920
 So these guys were mostly hanging out during the day.

07:11.920 --> 07:12.880
 They would get dressed up.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.200
 They'd put on suits and ties like you're wearing.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.520
 They'd polish their shoes.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.280
 And they would sit around offices, drink tea,

07:20.280 --> 07:21.880
 sashos.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.720
 Then they'd feast at lunch.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.160
 And then at night, we would go out.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.720
 So part of my research, because I also had a bottleneck

07:27.720 --> 07:31.200
 at my research, I was going to the state archives in Tashkent.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.160
 And because of the state of Uzbekistan,

07:34.160 --> 07:36.520
 that was a very kind of a suspicious thing to do.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.160
 So it took a while to get in.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.280
 So I had downtime in Tashkent, just like these guys.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.800
 So I got to know them pretty well.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.880
 And it was really just an accidental kind of thing.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.600
 But grew quite close to them.

07:47.600 --> 07:51.520
 And I developed an appreciation of, which now I think, again,

07:51.520 --> 07:53.240
 thinking of the seeds of all this,

07:53.240 --> 07:57.200
 these people had already lived, young guys in the 20s,

07:57.200 --> 07:59.880
 they'd already lived in six or seven countries.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.240
 They all spoke half a dozen languages.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.040
 One of my best friends there had been a kickboxer

08:06.040 --> 08:08.240
 and breakdancer trained in Tehran.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.240
 His father was a theater person in Afghanistan.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.480
 He told stories of escaping death in Afghanistan

08:14.480 --> 08:17.000
 during the Civil War, going to Uzbekistan,

08:17.000 --> 08:18.840
 escaping death there.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.200
 And these were very real stories.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.880
 Can you also just briefly mention, geographically speaking,

08:25.880 --> 08:28.720
 Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,

08:28.720 --> 08:32.720
 you mentioned Iran, who are the neighbors of all of this?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.280
 What are we supposed to be thinking about for people?

08:35.280 --> 08:38.840
 I was always terrible at geography and spatial information.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.960
 So can you lay it out?

08:39.960 --> 08:41.000
 Yeah, sure, sure.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.360
 So Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan.

08:44.360 --> 08:49.360
 It was a hub of Russian imperial power in the 19th century.

08:49.720 --> 08:53.840
 The Russians take the city from a local kind of Muslim dynasty

08:53.840 --> 08:55.400
 in 1865.

08:55.400 --> 09:00.200
 It becomes the city, the hub of Soviet power in Central Asia

09:00.200 --> 09:01.800
 after 1917.

09:01.800 --> 09:06.800
 It becomes the center of the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan,

09:06.840 --> 09:09.240
 which becomes independent finally in 1991

09:09.240 --> 09:10.760
 when the Soviet Union collapses.

09:10.760 --> 09:14.440
 So these are all like these republics

09:14.440 --> 09:18.440
 are the fingertips of Soviet power in Central Asia.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.360
 That's right.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.400
 And they've been independent since 1991,

09:22.400 --> 09:25.600
 but they have struggled to disentangle themselves

09:25.600 --> 09:28.320
 from Moscow, from one another.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.400
 And now they face very serious pressure from China

09:31.400 --> 09:34.920
 to form a kind of periphery of the great machine

09:34.920 --> 09:37.760
 that is the Chinese economy and its ambitions

09:37.760 --> 09:39.720
 to stretch across Asia.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.720
 For Afghanistan, where my roommates, my friends,

09:43.720 --> 09:48.720
 hailed from Afghanistan had fallen into civil war

09:48.720 --> 09:52.600
 in the late 1970s when leftists tried to seize power there

09:52.600 --> 09:54.040
 in 1978.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.600
 The Soviet Union then extended from Uzbekistan,

09:57.600 --> 10:01.000
 crossing the border with its forces in 1979

10:01.000 --> 10:03.200
 to try to shore up this leftist government

10:03.200 --> 10:05.440
 that had seized power in 1978.

10:05.440 --> 10:09.320
 And so for Central Asians in the wider region,

10:09.320 --> 10:13.320
 their fate had for some decades been tied to Afghanistan

10:13.320 --> 10:14.480
 in a variety of ways,

10:14.480 --> 10:17.840
 but it became much more connected in 1980s

10:17.840 --> 10:22.840
 when the Soviet Red Army occupied Afghanistan for 10 years.

10:23.320 --> 10:26.920
 And here, I refer your listeners and viewers to Rambo 3

10:26.920 --> 10:28.640
 as the guide to...

10:28.640 --> 10:30.120
 The historically accurate guide.

10:30.120 --> 10:33.240
 The historically accurate, the Bible of Afghan history

10:33.240 --> 10:37.920
 in Rambo 3, as a fantastic window onto the American view

10:37.920 --> 10:39.360
 of the war, right?

10:39.360 --> 10:41.760
 But for most Afghans, there are people who fought

10:41.760 --> 10:45.640
 against the Soviet army, but of a certain generation,

10:45.640 --> 10:50.640
 the guys I knew, their mission was to survive.

10:50.880 --> 10:55.640
 And so they fled in waves by the millions to Pakistan,

10:55.640 --> 10:59.640
 to Iran, some went north into Central Asia later in the 1990s,

10:59.640 --> 11:02.240
 and some were displaced across the planet.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.000
 So California, where we're sitting today,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.960
 has a large community that came in the 80s and 90s

11:07.960 --> 11:09.720
 in the East Bay.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.720
 Can I ask a quick question that's a little bit of a tangent?

11:12.720 --> 11:13.960
 Yep.

11:13.960 --> 11:18.960
 What is the correct or the respectful way to pronounce

11:19.480 --> 11:24.480
 Afghanistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iran?

11:25.880 --> 11:28.520
 So as a Russian speaker, Afghanistan,

11:30.080 --> 11:34.760
 the on versus the and, is it different country by country?

11:34.760 --> 11:37.200
 As an English speaker in America,

11:37.200 --> 11:41.400
 is it pretentious and disrespectful to say Afghanistan,

11:41.400 --> 11:44.440
 or is it the opposite of respectful to say it that way?

11:44.440 --> 11:45.440
 What are your thoughts on that?

11:45.440 --> 11:47.240
 That's a fascinating question.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.200
 I defer to the people from those countries

11:50.200 --> 11:52.600
 to of course sort out those politics.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.440
 I think one of the fascinating things about the region broadly

11:55.440 --> 11:57.080
 is that it is a place of so many cultures

11:57.080 --> 12:00.040
 and it's really quite cosmopolitan.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.000
 So I think people are mostly quite forgiving

12:02.000 --> 12:04.480
 about how you say Afghanistan, Afghanistan.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.840
 It's not like Paris.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.680
 Yeah, right, right.

12:06.680 --> 12:07.880
 The French are not forgiving.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.080
 No, no, no, exactly.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.680
 I think people are very forgiving.

12:10.680 --> 12:15.680
 And I think that Iranians are a bit more instructive

12:16.480 --> 12:20.080
 and suggesting Iran rather than Iran, right?

12:20.080 --> 12:25.080
 Iraq, Iraq, I think there's come to be a fit

12:25.080 --> 12:27.480
 between certain ways of pronouncing these places

12:27.480 --> 12:31.000
 and the position that Americans take about them, right?

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
 So it's more jarring when people say Iraq

12:36.280 --> 12:39.240
 and it comes with a claim

12:39.240 --> 12:42.120
 that a certain kind of person should be the victim

12:42.120 --> 12:44.600
 of violence or, right, so does that, yeah.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.040
 It's kind of like talking about the Democratic Party

12:47.040 --> 12:48.440
 or the Democrat Party.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.720
 It's sometimes using certain kind of terminology

12:51.720 --> 12:56.720
 to make a little bit of a sort of implied statement

12:57.720 --> 12:58.680
 about your beliefs.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.520
 That's fascinating.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.640
 Yeah, I mean, I think when I hear Iraq and Iran,

13:02.640 --> 13:04.840
 I mean, I think it, yeah, is it intentional

13:04.840 --> 13:07.240
 in the case of a Democrat or is it just a,

13:07.240 --> 13:08.080
 and it's a whatever.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.960
 Again, I think most Iranians and Afghans,

13:09.960 --> 13:12.880
 people I know have been very cool about that.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.080
 What annoys Afghans now, I can say, I think it's great to say,

13:16.080 --> 13:20.080
 I don't mean to speak for mainstay group people,

13:20.080 --> 13:23.240
 but I can just share with our non Afghan friends.

13:24.360 --> 13:28.600
 The term Afghani is a kind of term of offense

13:28.600 --> 13:29.880
 because that's the name of the currency.

13:29.880 --> 13:34.360
 And so lots of people ask, you know, why having,

13:34.360 --> 13:36.560
 especially again, it's more directed at Americans

13:36.560 --> 13:38.400
 because, you know, we've been so deeply involved

13:38.400 --> 13:40.920
 in that country, obviously for the last 20 years, right?

13:40.920 --> 13:43.360
 So Afghans ask why after 20 years,

13:43.360 --> 13:45.320
 are you still calling us the wrong name?

13:45.320 --> 13:46.560
 What is the right name?

13:46.560 --> 13:48.440
 Just, they prefer Afghans.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.280
 Afghans.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.160
 Yeah, and Afghani is the name of the currency.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.000
 And so.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
 I just dodged the bullet

13:54.000 --> 13:54.840
 because I was gonna say Afghans.

13:54.840 --> 13:55.680
 That's cool.

13:55.680 --> 13:56.520
 Yeah, I hear you.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.360
 That's really great to know.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.360
 Yeah, and it's, again, I think,

13:59.360 --> 14:01.760
 but I would emphasize that people are quite open

14:01.760 --> 14:06.160
 and you know, it's a whole region of incredible diversity

14:06.160 --> 14:09.800
 and respect for linguistic pluralism actually.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.200
 So I think that, you know,

14:11.200 --> 14:14.240
 but I also appreciate that in this context,

14:14.240 --> 14:16.160
 when there's a lot of pain, you know,

14:16.160 --> 14:18.840
 in the Afghan diaspora community in particular,

14:18.840 --> 14:22.000
 you know, being called the wrong name after 20 years

14:22.000 --> 14:24.800
 when they already feel so betrayed at this moment,

14:24.800 --> 14:25.760
 you know, just kind of,

14:25.760 --> 14:27.960
 if one follows us on social media,

14:27.960 --> 14:32.160
 that is one kind of hot wire, right?

14:32.160 --> 14:35.400
 Yeah, so the reason I ask about pronunciation

14:35.400 --> 14:37.360
 is because, yes, it is true

14:37.360 --> 14:39.880
 that there are certain things where mispronounced

14:39.880 --> 14:42.800
 kind of reveal that you don't care enough

14:42.800 --> 14:44.360
 to pronounce correctly.

14:44.360 --> 14:47.040
 You don't know enough to pronounce correctly.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.760
 And you dismiss the culture and the people,

14:49.760 --> 14:53.400
 which I think as per your writing is something that,

14:54.960 --> 14:57.160
 if it's okay, I'll go with Afghanistan.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.440
 Just because I'm used to it.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.520
 I say Iraq, Iran, but I say Afghanistan.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.840
 Yeah, it's great.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.040
 As you do in your writing, Afghanistan suffers

15:06.040 --> 15:08.600
 from much misunderstanding from the rest of the world.

15:08.600 --> 15:13.600
 But back to our discussion of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,

15:13.760 --> 15:17.560
 the whole region that gives us context

15:17.560 --> 15:18.880
 for the events of 9 11.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.280
 Right, right.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.560
 So yeah, if we get back to that day,

15:21.560 --> 15:23.880
 in the weeks that followed,

15:23.880 --> 15:26.360
 in my mind went to the community I knew in Tashkent,

15:28.000 --> 15:28.840
 which was interesting.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.800
 I mean, they were,

15:29.800 --> 15:33.080
 so Islam was the focal point of our conversation in the US

15:33.080 --> 15:34.040
 about 9 11, right?

15:34.040 --> 15:36.240
 Everyone to know what was the relationship

15:36.240 --> 15:39.840
 between the terrific violence and that religious tradition

15:39.840 --> 15:44.840
 with its 1 billion plus followers across the globe, right?

15:45.160 --> 15:47.000
 That became the issue of course

15:47.000 --> 15:49.400
 for American security institutions,

15:49.400 --> 15:53.440
 for local state and police institutions, right?

15:53.440 --> 15:54.320
 I mean, it became the,

15:54.320 --> 15:55.560
 I think it was the question

15:55.560 --> 15:56.680
 that most Americans had on their minds.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.160
 So again, I didn't imagine myself

15:59.160 --> 16:00.880
 as someone who had all the answers, of course,

16:00.880 --> 16:03.680
 but given my background in coming at this

16:03.680 --> 16:04.600
 from Russian history,

16:04.600 --> 16:06.880
 coming at this from studying empire

16:06.880 --> 16:09.880
 and trying to think about the region broadly.

16:09.880 --> 16:10.760
 You know, I was very alarmed

16:10.760 --> 16:12.880
 at the way that the conversation went.

16:12.880 --> 16:13.920
 Can I ask you a question?

16:13.920 --> 16:18.920
 What was your feeling on that morning of 9 11?

16:19.160 --> 16:20.280
 Who did this?

16:20.280 --> 16:21.840
 Isn't that a natural feeling?

16:21.840 --> 16:25.680
 There's a, it's coupled with fear of what's next,

16:25.680 --> 16:27.160
 especially when you're in DC.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.280
 But also who is this? Is this an accident?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.040
 Is this a deliberate terrorist attack?

16:32.040 --> 16:34.960
 Is this domestic?

16:34.960 --> 16:37.440
 What were your thoughts of the options

16:37.440 --> 16:41.040
 and the internal ranking given here by expertise?

16:41.040 --> 16:44.040
 I mean, I suppose I was taken by the narrative

16:44.040 --> 16:46.400
 that this was international.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.920
 I mean, I'd also lived in New York

16:47.920 --> 16:50.760
 during one of the first bombings in 94

16:50.760 --> 16:52.240
 of the World Trade Center.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.920
 So it was clear to me that a radical community

16:53.920 --> 16:58.240
 had really fixed New York as part of their imagination of,

16:58.240 --> 16:59.920
 and I immediately thought it was a,

16:59.920 --> 17:04.320
 it was a kind of blow to American power.

17:04.320 --> 17:08.680
 And, you know, I was drawn by the symbolism of it.

17:08.680 --> 17:09.680
 You know, if you think of it as an act,

17:09.680 --> 17:12.640
 it was a kind of an act of speech,

17:12.640 --> 17:16.840
 if you will, kind of a way of speaking to,

17:16.840 --> 17:18.520
 from a position of relative weakness,

17:18.520 --> 17:21.440
 speaking to an imperial power.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.160
 And that I saw, I saw it as a kind of symbolic,

17:24.160 --> 17:26.560
 you know, speech act of that with horrific,

17:26.560 --> 17:30.920
 you know, real world consequences for all those innocent victims

17:30.920 --> 17:32.000
 for the fire and for the police

17:32.000 --> 17:35.600
 and just the, you know, the horror of the moment.

17:35.600 --> 17:39.640
 So I did see it as transcending the United States,

17:39.640 --> 17:41.880
 but I did not see it as really having anything

17:41.880 --> 17:45.360
 necessarily to do fundamentally about Afghanistan

17:45.360 --> 17:48.000
 and the history of the region that I'd been studying

17:48.000 --> 17:49.760
 and the community people that I knew

17:49.760 --> 17:51.880
 who were not particularly religious, right?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.200
 The guys I hung out with actually wore me out

17:54.200 --> 17:56.120
 because they wanted to go out every night.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.640
 They wanted to party every night.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.480
 We had. Drinking?

17:58.480 --> 17:59.320
 Yeah.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.560
 We had discussions about alcohol.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.640
 I mean, Uzbekistan is famous for its.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.240
 Drinking. It's drinking.

18:04.240 --> 18:05.080
 You know, it's.

18:05.080 --> 18:05.920
 That's something to look forward to.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.440
 So I do want to travel to that part of the world.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.440
 When was the last time you were in that part of the world?

18:11.440 --> 18:12.680
 Early 2000s.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.880
 Well, then mid 2000s, 2010s.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.480
 So wait, so by the way, we're drinking vodka.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.880
 What's the, what's the weapon of choice?

18:20.880 --> 18:26.200
 Uzbekistan has a cooperative vodka as the choice.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.240
 And it informs, you know, and it's,

18:28.240 --> 18:29.520
 but the fascinating thing, you know,

18:29.520 --> 18:32.480
 and as a student is what you're observing as a non Muslim,

18:32.480 --> 18:34.160
 you know, I'm a non Russian.

18:34.160 --> 18:38.800
 I'm this is all, you know, culturally new to me.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.760
 And I'm, you know, a student of all that, right?

18:40.760 --> 18:42.480
 So I got a student doing my work there.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.280
 So you're like Jane Goodall of vodka in Russia.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.480
 That's right. Just observing.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.320
 That's right. Yeah. Yeah.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.440
 And then you get the, you get the some of gone,

18:50.440 --> 18:52.040
 the grass vodka, you get, you know,

18:52.040 --> 18:54.280
 I have, I've had some long nights

18:54.280 --> 18:59.280
 on the Kazakhstan frontier that I'm not proud of, you know,

19:00.160 --> 19:01.560
 but you got to know the people

19:01.560 --> 19:03.760
 and some of them from, yeah, yeah.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.960
 But intellectually, so the thing,

19:04.960 --> 19:06.760
 I mean, the, the, the fascinating thing there was it,

19:06.760 --> 19:09.240
 and just as a, I mean, there's a whole,

19:09.240 --> 19:10.080
 yeah, I'm destroying, right?

19:10.080 --> 19:14.440
 But there are great contributions by, you know,

19:14.440 --> 19:15.920
 anthropologists and ethnographers who,

19:15.920 --> 19:17.800
 who've gone across the planet and tried to understand

19:17.800 --> 19:21.600
 how Muslims understand the tradition at different contexts.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.320
 So many usbecks will say, you know,

19:25.680 --> 19:27.200
 this is part of our national culture

19:27.200 --> 19:29.760
 to drink and eat as we please, right?

19:29.760 --> 19:31.600
 And yet I'm a very devout Muslim.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.920
 And so of course you can encounter other Muslim communities

19:34.920 --> 19:37.400
 who won't touch alcohol, right?

19:37.400 --> 19:40.320
 But it's become kind of, I think it's very much, you know,

19:40.320 --> 19:42.360
 Soviet culture left a deep impression

19:42.360 --> 19:43.200
 in each of these places.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.400
 And so there are ways of thinking, ways of performing,

19:47.400 --> 19:49.720
 ways of, you know, enjoying oneself

19:49.720 --> 19:53.320
 that are shared across Soviet and former Soviet space

19:53.320 --> 19:54.640
 to this day, right?

19:54.640 --> 19:57.800
 And you've written also about Muslims in the Soviet Union.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.120
 That's right.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.320
 The, there's an article that there's a paywall

20:02.320 --> 20:04.920
 so I couldn't read it and I really want to read it.

20:04.920 --> 20:09.920
 Is a Moscow in the mosque or something like that.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.840
 Right, right.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.280
 By the way, just another tangent, not a tangent.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.120
 Yeah.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.280
 So I bought all your books, I love them very much.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.120
 Thank you, thank you.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.040
 One of the reasons I bought them

20:20.040 --> 20:24.320
 and read many parts is because they're easy to buy.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.960
 Unlike articles, every single website has a paywall.

20:27.960 --> 20:28.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.720
 So it's very, very frustrating to read brilliant scholars

20:32.720 --> 20:33.560
 such as yourself.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.320
 No, no, no.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.520
 I wish there was one fee I could pay everywhere.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.840
 I don't care what that fee is,

20:38.840 --> 20:42.200
 it just allows me to read some of your brilliant writing.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.040
 No, no, thank you, I hear you.

20:43.040 --> 20:47.280
 No, I think moving toward more kind of open source,

20:47.280 --> 20:49.120
 formatting stuff, I think is what a lot of journals

20:49.120 --> 20:50.000
 are thinking about now.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.600
 And I think it's definitely for the kind of

20:52.600 --> 20:54.520
 democratization of knowledge and scholarship.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.920
 That's definitely an important thing

20:55.920 --> 20:56.880
 that we should all think about.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.360
 And I think, you know, we need to exert pressure

21:00.360 --> 21:01.960
 on these publishers to do that.

21:01.960 --> 21:02.800
 So I appreciate that.

21:02.800 --> 21:03.840
 This is what I'm doing here.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.680
 Yeah, yeah, good, good.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.520
 No, I appreciate it.

21:05.520 --> 21:10.520
 So your thought was Afghanistan is not,

21:10.520 --> 21:14.520
 it's not going to be the center, the source of where.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.040
 Exactly, it's not the center of this.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.120
 And if that country isn't going to fix,

21:18.120 --> 21:20.600
 isn't going to fix the, you know,

21:20.600 --> 21:25.200
 toxic malformal politics that produced 9.11, right?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.520
 I think it's thinking of some of the personalities

21:26.520 --> 21:28.840
 just thinking about going back to the Tashkin story

21:28.840 --> 21:29.800
 which I'll end with.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.760
 I mean, just observing, you know,

21:31.760 --> 21:35.120
 real Muslims doing things and then asking questions

21:35.120 --> 21:39.040
 about it and trying to understand through their eyes

21:39.040 --> 21:40.960
 what the tradition means to them.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.040
 And then, you know, you have a,

21:42.040 --> 21:43.720
 we had a very narrow conversation

21:43.720 --> 21:46.160
 about what Islam is that, you know,

21:46.160 --> 21:48.360
 generated immediately exploded in, you know,

21:48.360 --> 21:50.160
 on the day of 9.11, right?

21:50.160 --> 21:53.120
 And then of course, I think the antipathy

21:53.120 --> 21:55.400
 toward Islam and Muslims, you know,

21:55.400 --> 21:59.960
 was informed by racism, informed by xenophobia.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.120
 So it became a perfect storm.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.960
 I think of demonization that didn't sit with, you know,

22:04.960 --> 22:06.200
 what I knew about the tradition

22:06.200 --> 22:08.400
 and with the actual people that I had known

22:08.400 --> 22:09.240
 because then going back to,

22:09.240 --> 22:11.880
 I mean, they're other friends and encounters and so on,

22:11.880 --> 22:14.440
 but just thinking about Afghanistan and Tashkin for a moment.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.480
 I mean, just that thought about my friends

22:17.480 --> 22:19.360
 who had been, who had suffered a great deal

22:19.360 --> 22:21.880
 in their short lives, who had been, you know,

22:21.880 --> 22:24.720
 cast aside from country to country,

22:24.720 --> 22:26.720
 but had found a place in Tashkin

22:26.720 --> 22:28.720
 with some relative stability.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.080
 And, you know, they wanted to go out every night

22:31.080 --> 22:32.960
 and, you know, they explained, you know,

22:32.960 --> 22:34.840
 one friend, we talked about it with the alcohol

22:34.840 --> 22:37.320
 and he didn't get crazy, but he was like,

22:37.320 --> 22:38.920
 you can drink, but just don't get drunk.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.360
 That's permissible within Islam, right?

22:42.760 --> 22:45.000
 And he was, you know, ethnic Pashtun.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.680
 I think Uzbeks had a different view, you know,

22:47.680 --> 22:49.880
 often the more vodka, the better, you know?

22:49.880 --> 22:51.880
 And it doesn't violate, as I understand Islam.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.120
 So even, you know, it's kind of a silly example,

22:54.120 --> 22:56.200
 but it's just an illustration of the ways in which

22:56.200 --> 22:58.040
 different communities, different generations,

22:58.040 --> 23:01.560
 different people can come at this very complex tradition

23:01.560 --> 23:02.520
 in so many different ways.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.160
 So obviously, if whatever kind of scholar you are,

23:06.160 --> 23:08.240
 or any kind of expert, whatever, you know,

23:08.240 --> 23:12.120
 it's always disconcerting to see your field of specialization

23:12.120 --> 23:13.720
 be flattened, right?

23:13.720 --> 23:16.480
 And then be flattened and then be turned to

23:16.480 --> 23:18.400
 arguments for violence, right?

23:18.400 --> 23:22.200
 Mixed up with natural human feelings of hate.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.040
 Yeah.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.400
 And, and hurt, and pain.

23:25.400 --> 23:28.000
 So I, you know, I mean, that day I vividly remember

23:28.000 --> 23:32.720
 I sat with other PhD historians in different fields.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.640
 We, you know, we oddly enough had lunch that day

23:35.640 --> 23:37.240
 and it kind of deserted Washington.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.680
 Some place was open when we went.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.880
 And we just thought, you know, this is going to kind of

23:41.880 --> 23:45.720
 open up like a great maw of destruction.

23:45.720 --> 23:50.920
 And, you know, the American state is going to destroy

23:50.920 --> 23:53.720
 and it's going to destroy in this geography.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.480
 And I thought that was misplaced for lots of reasons.

23:56.480 --> 23:59.120
 And then I think if when, you know,

23:59.120 --> 24:02.480
 I'd been doing some research on Afghanistan then

24:02.480 --> 24:03.560
 I was kind of shifting to the South.

24:03.560 --> 24:08.600
 And I'd been looking at the Taliban from afar for some years.

24:08.600 --> 24:12.440
 And, you know, I think it's clear now that in retrospect

24:12.440 --> 24:15.280
 there were opportunities for alternative policies

24:15.280 --> 24:16.520
 at that moment.

24:16.520 --> 24:20.840
 So what should the conversation have been like?

24:20.840 --> 24:23.320
 What should we have done differently?

24:23.320 --> 24:28.480
 Because, you know, from a perspective of the time

24:28.480 --> 24:33.360
 the United States was invaded by a foreign force.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.040
 What is the proper response?

24:35.040 --> 24:36.680
 Or what is the proper conversation

24:36.680 --> 24:39.000
 about the proper response at the time, you think?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.240
 You know, I know my colleague at Sanford,

24:41.240 --> 24:44.520
 Connolly Saris would tell me this is above my pay grade.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.560
 And, you know, she makes a point in her classes

24:46.560 --> 24:50.160
 to talk about how difficult decision making is

24:50.160 --> 24:52.120
 under such intense pressure.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.840
 And I appreciate that.

24:53.840 --> 24:57.320
 You know, I am an historian who sits safely in my office.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.640
 I don't like battlefields.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.400
 I don't like taking risks.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.920
 So I can see all those limits.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.200
 You know, I'm not a military expert.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.120
 I've been accused of being a spy wherever I've gone

25:07.120 --> 25:08.640
 because of the way I look and because of my nationality

25:08.640 --> 25:10.240
 and so on, but I'm not a spy.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.440
 So I defer, you know, I respect the expertise

25:12.440 --> 25:13.640
 of all those communities.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.920
 But I think they acted out of ignorance.

25:16.920 --> 25:19.600
 They acted, I think, because, I mean, you think of the,

25:19.600 --> 25:22.760
 in a way, there was a compensatory aspect

25:22.760 --> 25:23.800
 of this decision making.

25:23.800 --> 25:27.520
 I mean, the Bush administration failed.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.520
 This is an extraordinary failure, right?

25:29.520 --> 25:30.360
 So if we start...

25:30.360 --> 25:31.200
 In which way?

25:31.200 --> 25:32.040
 If we're going to break down the...

25:32.040 --> 25:32.880
 A failure of intelligence.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.720
 I mean, if you follow the story of Richard Clark...

25:36.720 --> 25:37.720
 Who's Richard Clark?

25:37.720 --> 25:40.720
 He was a national security expert

25:40.720 --> 25:43.320
 who was tasked with following Al Qaeda.

25:43.320 --> 25:47.160
 Who had produced a dossier under the Clinton administration

25:47.160 --> 25:50.600
 that he passed on to the George W. Bush administration.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.320
 And if you look at the work of Conleysa Rice,

25:53.320 --> 25:56.640
 she wrote a very famous, I think, unpaywalled

25:56.640 --> 25:58.600
 foreign affairs article that you can read,

25:58.600 --> 26:02.720
 announcing the George W. Bush foreign policy kind of outlook.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.160
 And it was all about great powers,

26:05.160 --> 26:07.440
 is about the rise of China, is about Russia.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.840
 I mean, there's definitely a kind of hangover

26:10.840 --> 26:15.880
 of those who missed having Russia as the boogeyman

26:15.880 --> 26:16.880
 who spoke...

26:16.880 --> 26:18.320
 The Clinton administration repeated again and again

26:18.320 --> 26:22.760
 the idea of making sure the bear stayed in his cage,

26:22.760 --> 26:26.440
 which is why the United States threw a lifeline

26:26.440 --> 26:31.000
 to the Central Asian states, hoping to have pipelines,

26:31.000 --> 26:34.480
 hoping to shore up their national sovereignty

26:34.480 --> 26:38.120
 as a way of containing Russia initially,

26:38.120 --> 26:42.080
 but also Iran, which sits to the south and west,

26:42.080 --> 26:43.720
 and then peripherally looking down the road

26:43.720 --> 26:45.560
 to China, to the east.

26:45.560 --> 26:50.160
 So the bear is what, like Russia?

26:50.160 --> 26:53.080
 Or is it kind of like some weird combination

26:53.080 --> 26:55.000
 of Russia, Iran, and China?

26:55.000 --> 26:59.800
 The bear is Russia, and Russia is this...

26:59.800 --> 27:01.680
 I'm trying to characterize the imagination

27:01.680 --> 27:04.840
 of some of these national security figures.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.160
 This is an image formed in the Cold War.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.400
 I mean, it has deeper seeds in European

27:09.400 --> 27:12.080
 and Western intellectual thought that go back,

27:12.080 --> 27:17.480
 at least to the 1850s and the reign of Tsar Nicholas I.

27:17.480 --> 27:21.040
 When we first get this language about the Russian Empire,

27:21.040 --> 27:24.840
 is this kind of evil polity.

27:24.840 --> 27:28.880
 Obviously, this was a kind of pillar of Reaganism,

27:28.880 --> 27:30.880
 but the Clinton folks kept that alive.

27:30.880 --> 27:36.000
 They wanted to make sure that American power would be unmatched,

27:36.000 --> 27:39.320
 and they, being creatures of the Cold War themselves,

27:39.320 --> 27:42.760
 they looked to Russia as a recession power

27:42.760 --> 27:45.480
 well before Putin was even thought of.

27:45.480 --> 27:49.320
 Yeah, I mean, you mentioned one deep,

27:49.320 --> 27:52.040
 profound historical piece in Rambo.

27:52.040 --> 27:55.560
 This probably, this conflict has to do

27:55.560 --> 27:58.560
 with another Celestino movie, Iraqi Four,

27:58.560 --> 28:01.960
 which is also historically accurate and based on...

28:01.960 --> 28:03.440
 It's basically a documentary.

28:03.440 --> 28:07.360
 So there is something about the American power,

28:07.360 --> 28:10.040
 even at the level of Condoleezza Rice,

28:10.040 --> 28:15.640
 these respected, deep kind of leaders and thinkers

28:15.640 --> 28:17.480
 about history in the future,

28:17.480 --> 28:22.080
 where they like to have competition with other superpowers

28:22.080 --> 28:26.440
 and almost conjure up superpowers,

28:26.440 --> 28:31.160
 even when those countries don't maybe, at the time,

28:31.160 --> 28:33.400
 at least deserve the label of superpower.

28:33.400 --> 28:34.320
 That's right, that's a great point.

28:34.320 --> 28:35.720
 Yeah, they're all awesome points.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.800
 So yeah, I mean, Russia was, I think many,

28:38.800 --> 28:41.480
 many experts, I mean, my mentor at Princeton,

28:41.480 --> 28:44.440
 Stephen Cochran, was then writing great things

28:44.440 --> 28:47.640
 about how, if you look at Russia's economy,

28:47.640 --> 28:52.160
 the scale of its GDP, its capacity to actually add globally,

28:52.160 --> 28:54.120
 it's all quite limited.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.680
 But Condoleezza Rice and the people around her,

28:58.320 --> 29:00.040
 came into power with George Obi Bush,

29:00.040 --> 29:03.480
 thinking that the foreign policy challenges of her era

29:03.480 --> 29:06.400
 would be those of the past, right?

29:06.400 --> 29:08.040
 Richard Clark and others within the administration

29:08.040 --> 29:10.360
 warned that, in fact, there is this group

29:10.360 --> 29:12.880
 that has declared war against the United States,

29:12.880 --> 29:14.680
 and they are coming for us.

29:14.680 --> 29:17.200
 The FBI had been following these people around

29:17.200 --> 29:18.040
 for many months.

29:18.040 --> 29:21.800
 And so by the time George Obi Bush comes to power,

29:21.800 --> 29:23.720
 lots of Alcatraz activists, well, not lots,

29:23.720 --> 29:26.040
 but perhaps a dozen or so,

29:26.040 --> 29:29.800
 are already training in the United States, right?

29:29.800 --> 29:31.720
 And what we knew immediately from the biographies

29:31.720 --> 29:34.360
 of some of the characters of the attackers of 9.11,

29:34.360 --> 29:37.080
 it was a hot spot for people from across the planet,

29:37.080 --> 29:39.280
 but most of them were Saudi, right?

29:39.280 --> 29:41.200
 And that was known very early on,

29:41.200 --> 29:43.200
 or presumably very early on.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.480
 So again, if we go back to your big question

29:44.480 --> 29:47.040
 about the geography, why Afghanistan,

29:47.040 --> 29:48.200
 it didn't add up, right?

29:48.200 --> 29:51.200
 It seemed to me that Afghanistan was a kind of soft target.

29:51.200 --> 29:54.080
 It was a place to have explosions,

29:54.080 --> 29:58.320
 to seemingly recapture American supremacy.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.400
 And also, I think in many quarters,

30:00.400 --> 30:02.600
 there was a deep urge for revenge.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.360
 And this is a place to have some casualties,

30:05.360 --> 30:07.400
 have some explosions.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.520
 And then I think, you know,

30:08.520 --> 30:11.280
 restore the legitimacy of the Bush administration

30:11.280 --> 30:14.000
 by showing that we are in charge, we will pay.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.400
 And I think there was a very old fashioned punitive dimension

30:17.400 --> 30:19.880
 which rests upon the presumption that

30:19.880 --> 30:21.520
 if we intimidate these people,

30:21.520 --> 30:23.760
 they'll know not to try this again, right?

30:23.760 --> 30:25.560
 All these I would suggest are all misreadings

30:25.560 --> 30:28.280
 of an organization that was always global.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.600
 It had no real center.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
 I mean, it called itself the center.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.800
 It's one way to translate Al Qaeda,

30:32.800 --> 30:35.480
 but that center was really in the imagination.

30:36.760 --> 30:39.160
 Bin Laden bounced around from country to country.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.680
 And crucially, I think a dimension

30:42.680 --> 30:45.120
 that I don't claim to know anything new about,

30:45.120 --> 30:47.840
 but has endured as a kind of doubt,

30:47.840 --> 30:50.280
 is the role of Saudi Arabia and the fact that, you know,

30:50.280 --> 30:54.920
 the muscle in that operation of 911 was Saudi, right?

30:54.920 --> 30:57.400
 I mean, this was a Saudi operation with,

30:57.400 --> 31:00.280
 if one thinks again, just on the basis of nationalities,

31:00.280 --> 31:04.360
 Saudis, you know, an Egyptian or two, a Lebanese guy,

31:04.360 --> 31:08.560
 and the Egyptian guy had been studying in Germany.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.880
 He was an urban planner, right?

31:10.880 --> 31:13.520
 So if one thinks of the imagination of this, I mean,

31:13.520 --> 31:17.000
 and if I did, if you look at the kind of typology of

31:17.000 --> 31:19.360
 the figures who have led this radical movement,

31:19.360 --> 31:21.920
 I mean, if you think of the global jihadists,

31:21.920 --> 31:25.400
 they are mostly not religious scholars, right?

31:25.400 --> 31:27.640
 Bin Laden was not a religious scholar.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.360
 His training was an engineer, you know,

31:29.360 --> 31:31.080
 some biographers claim that he was a playboy

31:31.080 --> 31:34.640
 for much of his youth, but really that these ideas,

31:34.640 --> 31:37.560
 I think that's probably why they chose the Twin Towers.

31:37.560 --> 31:42.560
 I mean, this is an imagination fueled by training

31:43.120 --> 31:45.640
 and engineering, I mean, a lot of the, you know,

31:45.640 --> 31:47.520
 the sociology, if you do a kind of prospochography

31:47.520 --> 31:50.760
 of a lot of these leading jihadists,

31:50.760 --> 31:53.120
 their backgrounds are not in Islamic scholarship,

31:53.120 --> 31:55.760
 but actually in engineering and kind of practical sciences

31:55.760 --> 31:59.240
 and professions, medical doctors are among their ranks.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.040
 And so there's long been a tension between Islamic scholars

32:03.040 --> 32:05.360
 who devote their whole lives to study of texts

32:05.360 --> 32:08.000
 and commentary and interpretation.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.640
 And then what some scholars call kind of new intellectuals,

32:10.640 --> 32:12.400
 new Muslim authorities,

32:12.400 --> 32:16.080
 who actually have secular university educations,

32:16.080 --> 32:17.840
 often in the natural sciences or engineering

32:17.840 --> 32:21.440
 and technical fields, who then bring that kind of mindset,

32:21.440 --> 32:25.240
 if you will, to what Muslim scholars call

32:25.240 --> 32:27.960
 the religious sciences, which are, you know,

32:27.960 --> 32:31.960
 a field of kind of ambiguity and of gradation

32:31.960 --> 32:36.520
 and of subtlety and nuance and really of decades of training

32:36.520 --> 32:39.840
 before one becomes authoritative to speak about issues

32:39.840 --> 32:41.240
 like whether or not it's legitimate

32:41.240 --> 32:43.280
 to take someone else's life.

32:43.280 --> 32:47.440
 Were the relation to Afghanistan, who was bin Laden?

32:47.440 --> 32:49.360
 Bin Laden was a visitor.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.720
 If you look at his whole life course,

32:53.840 --> 32:55.800
 part of it is an enigma still.

32:55.800 --> 32:59.920
 You know, he is from a Saudi elite family,

32:59.920 --> 33:03.960
 but a family that kind of has a Yemeni Arabian sea

33:03.960 --> 33:07.080
 kind of genealogy.

33:07.080 --> 33:10.240
 So the family has no relationship to Afghanistan

33:10.240 --> 33:13.560
 past or present, except at some point in 1980s,

33:13.560 --> 33:16.960
 when he went like thousands of other young Saudis,

33:16.960 --> 33:20.680
 first to Pakistan, to places like Bashar on the border,

33:20.680 --> 33:24.680
 where they wanted to aid the jihad in some capacity.

33:25.720 --> 33:29.160
 And for the most part, the Arabs who went

33:29.160 --> 33:32.120
 opened up hospitals, some opened up schools.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.960
 The bin Laden family had long been

33:34.960 --> 33:37.320
 based in engineering construction.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.400
 So it's thought that he used some of those skills

33:39.400 --> 33:42.440
 and resources and connections to build things.

33:42.440 --> 33:47.440
 You know, we have images of him firing a gun for show,

33:47.720 --> 33:48.560
 right?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.600
 It's not clear that he ever actually fired a gun

33:50.600 --> 33:52.200
 in what we would call combat.

33:53.920 --> 33:55.480
 Again, I could be corrected by this.

33:55.480 --> 33:57.800
 And I think, you know, there are competing accounts

33:57.800 --> 33:58.640
 of who he was.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.080
 So he's kind of a...

34:00.080 --> 34:01.880
 I mean, many of these figures who sit at the pinnacle

34:01.880 --> 34:05.280
 of this world are, you know, fictive heroes

34:05.280 --> 34:08.400
 that people, you know, map their aspirations onto, right?

34:08.400 --> 34:10.400
 And so people like Mullah Omar,

34:10.400 --> 34:15.400
 who was then head of the Taliban, was really seen in public.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.680
 The current head of the Taliban

34:17.680 --> 34:19.440
 is almost never seen in public.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.240
 I mean, this is kind of studied air of mystery

34:22.240 --> 34:25.360
 that they've cultivated to make themselves available

34:25.360 --> 34:27.720
 for all kinds of fantasies, right?

34:27.720 --> 34:32.040
 Do you think he believed, so his religious beliefs,

34:33.680 --> 34:38.680
 do you think he believed some of the more extreme things

34:38.680 --> 34:41.840
 that enable him to commit terrorist acts,

34:41.840 --> 34:43.560
 maybe put another way,

34:43.560 --> 34:46.520
 what makes a man want to become a terrorist

34:46.520 --> 34:49.760
 and what aspect of bin Laden made him want to be a terrorist?

34:49.760 --> 34:52.080
 Right, great.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.680
 I mean, let me offer some observations.

34:53.680 --> 34:55.320
 I think, you know, there are others

34:55.320 --> 34:56.640
 who know more about bin Laden

34:56.640 --> 34:59.200
 and have far more expertise in al Qaeda.

34:59.200 --> 35:03.880
 So I'm coming this in an adjacent way,

35:03.880 --> 35:06.120
 kind of from Afghanistan and from my historical training.

35:06.120 --> 35:10.320
 So this is my two cents, so, you know, bear with me.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.520
 I don't have the authoritative account for this, but...

35:12.520 --> 35:13.640
 Which in itself is fascinating

35:13.640 --> 35:16.680
 because you're a historian of Afghanistan.

35:16.680 --> 35:20.760
 And the fact that bin Laden isn't a huge part

35:20.760 --> 35:23.520
 of your focus of study just means

35:23.520 --> 35:28.280
 that bin Laden is not a key part of the history of Afghanistan,

35:28.280 --> 35:30.560
 except that America made him a key part

35:30.560 --> 35:31.840
 of the history of Afghanistan.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.320
 I would endorse that, definitely.

35:33.320 --> 35:36.760
 I mean, you've put it in a very pitty, pitty way.

35:36.760 --> 35:40.080
 Yeah, so listen, he was an engineer.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.120
 He was said to be a playboy

35:42.120 --> 35:44.680
 who spent a lot of cash from his family.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.400
 You know, like many young Saudis

35:46.400 --> 35:47.800
 and from some other countries,

35:47.800 --> 35:50.120
 he was inspired by this idea

35:50.120 --> 35:52.320
 that there was Jihad in Afghanistan.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.360
 It was gonna take down one of the two superpowers,

35:55.360 --> 35:58.200
 the Soviet Union, who, you know,

35:58.200 --> 36:01.280
 the Red Army did murder hundreds of thousands,

36:01.280 --> 36:05.200
 perhaps as many as 2 million Afghan civilians

36:05.200 --> 36:06.440
 during that conflict.

36:07.320 --> 36:12.000
 It's very plausible and very, you know,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.440
 completely understandable that many young people

36:14.440 --> 36:18.240
 would see that cause as, you know,

36:18.240 --> 36:21.400
 the righteous, pious fighters for Jihad,

36:21.400 --> 36:23.440
 who call themselves Mujahideen,

36:23.440 --> 36:26.040
 arrayed against this evil empire, right,

36:26.040 --> 36:29.800
 of a godless Soviet empire that,

36:29.800 --> 36:31.920
 I mean, there's even confusion about what the Soviets wanted,

36:31.920 --> 36:33.640
 right, now we know much more about like

36:33.640 --> 36:36.240
 what the Kremlin wanted, what Brezhnev wanted,

36:36.240 --> 36:37.560
 and how the Soviet elite thought about it

36:37.560 --> 36:39.200
 because we have many more of their records.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.000
 But from the outside, you know, for Jimmy Carter

36:42.000 --> 36:44.680
 and then for Reagan, it looked like the Soviets

36:44.680 --> 36:47.880
 were making a move on South Asia

36:47.880 --> 36:50.760
 because they wanted to get to the warm water ports,

36:50.760 --> 36:52.640
 you know, which Russians always want supposedly, right?

36:52.640 --> 36:56.120
 And it was kind of a move to take over our oil

36:56.120 --> 36:58.760
 and, you know, to assert world domination, right?

36:58.760 --> 37:01.520
 So there are lots of ways in which this looked like

37:01.520 --> 37:03.320
 good receivable in Congress.

37:03.320 --> 37:06.920
 It looked like, you know, kind of Vietnam again,

37:06.920 --> 37:08.960
 but this time, this is our chance to get them.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.320
 And there are lots of great quotes, I mean, disturbing,

37:12.320 --> 37:15.360
 but really revealing quotes that American policy makers

37:15.360 --> 37:19.000
 made about wanting to give the Soviets their Vietnam.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.600
 So the CIA funneled, you know,

37:22.600 --> 37:24.080
 hundreds of millions of dollars into this project

37:24.080 --> 37:25.680
 to back the Mujahideen, you know,

37:25.680 --> 37:27.600
 who Reagan called freedom fighters.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.480
 And so, Bin Laden was part of that universe.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.040
 He's part of that, you know, he's swimming in the ocean

37:31.040 --> 37:34.640
 of these Afghans Mujahideen who out of size, you know,

37:34.640 --> 37:36.760
 did 95% of the fighting.

37:36.760 --> 37:37.760
 They're the ones who died.

37:37.760 --> 37:40.520
 They're the ones who defeated the Red Army, right?

37:40.520 --> 37:43.120
 The Arabs who were there did a little fighting,

37:43.120 --> 37:45.760
 but a lot of it was for, you know, their purposes.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.080
 It was to get experience.

37:47.080 --> 37:50.240
 It was to kind of create their reputations

37:50.240 --> 37:52.600
 like Bin Laden began to force for himself

37:52.600 --> 37:55.240
 of being spokesman for a global project.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.880
 Because by the late 80s, when Bin Laden, you know,

37:57.880 --> 38:00.520
 I think was more active and began conspiring

38:00.520 --> 38:02.800
 with people from other Arab countries,

38:02.800 --> 38:06.000
 the idea that, you know, Gorbachev became a power in 85.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.080
 He's like, let's get out of here.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.360
 This is draining the Soviet budget.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.400
 It's an embarrassment.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.200
 We didn't think about this properly.

38:13.200 --> 38:17.240
 Let's focus on restoring the party

38:17.240 --> 38:19.280
 and strengthening the Soviet Union.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.640
 Let's get out of this costly war.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.560
 You know, it's a waste.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.760
 It's not worth it.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.880
 We're even losing anything by getting out of Afghanistan.

38:26.880 --> 38:31.880
 And so their retreat was quite effective and successful

38:31.880 --> 38:33.120
 from the Soviet point of view, right?

38:33.120 --> 38:35.160
 It's not what we're seeing now.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.320
 What year was the retreat?

38:37.320 --> 38:41.720
 I mean, it began, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.560
 You know, he was a generation younger than the other guys.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.280
 He was a critic of the system.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.120
 He didn't want to abolish it.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.560
 He wanted to reform it.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.360
 He was a true believer in Soviet socialism

38:51.360 --> 38:55.640
 and in the party as a, you know, a monopolist, right?

38:56.760 --> 38:58.040
 But he was critical of the old guard

38:58.040 --> 39:00.920
 and recognized that the party had a change

39:00.920 --> 39:04.640
 and the whole system had a change to continue to compete.

39:04.640 --> 39:07.440
 And so Afghanistan was one element of this.

39:07.440 --> 39:11.440
 And so he pushed the Afghan elites

39:11.440 --> 39:14.320
 that Moscow was backing to basically say,

39:14.320 --> 39:16.320
 listen, we're gonna share power.

39:16.320 --> 39:19.640
 And so a figure named Najibullah,

39:19.640 --> 39:23.280
 who was a Soviet trained intelligence specialist

39:23.280 --> 39:26.400
 sitting in Kabul, agreed.

39:26.400 --> 39:30.280
 And he said, we need to have a more kind of pluralistic

39:30.280 --> 39:33.200
 accommodations approach to our enemies

39:33.200 --> 39:37.400
 who are backed by the US mainly, sitting in Pakistan,

39:37.400 --> 39:40.560
 sitting in Iran, backed by his Arabs to agree,

39:40.560 --> 39:42.320
 getting money from Saudi.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.120
 And he said, let's draw some of them into the government

39:45.120 --> 39:48.440
 and basically have a kind of unity government

39:48.440 --> 39:50.800
 that would make some space the opposition.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.320
 And for the most part, with US backing,

39:53.320 --> 39:56.000
 with Pakistani backing, with Iranian backing

39:56.000 --> 39:58.520
 and with Saudi backing, the opposition said, no,

39:58.520 --> 40:00.640
 we're not going to reconcile.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.640
 We're gonna push you off the cliff.

40:02.640 --> 40:06.640
 And so that story goes on from at least 1987,

40:06.640 --> 40:10.120
 the last Soviet Red Army troops leave early 1989.

40:11.160 --> 40:15.200
 But the Najibullah government holds on for three more years.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.720
 It is the, I mean, they're still getting some help from the Soviet Union.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.640
 Its enemies are still getting help from the US mainly.

40:21.640 --> 40:26.640
 And it's not until 1992 that they lose.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.520
 And then Mujahideen come into power.

40:29.520 --> 40:33.040
 They immediately, they're deeply fractured.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.880
 And that's where bin Laden is watching all of this unroll.

40:35.880 --> 40:36.720
 That's right.

40:36.720 --> 40:37.840
 And he's part of the mix, but he's also mobile.

40:37.840 --> 40:42.240
 So he at one point goes, is in Sudan.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.040
 He's moving from place to place.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.200
 His people are all over the world.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.160
 In fact, they, I mean, if you think of the,

40:48.160 --> 40:50.160
 once the Mujahideen take power,

40:50.160 --> 40:52.080
 you know, they have difficulties with Arab fighters too.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.840
 And they don't want them coming in and, you know,

40:53.840 --> 40:57.120
 messing with Mujahideen regard this as like, you know,

40:57.120 --> 40:59.320
 this is an Afghan national state that we're going to build.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.160
 It's going to be Islamic.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.600
 It's going to be an Islamic state,

41:01.600 --> 41:03.720
 but you can't interfere with us.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.640
 And so they're always tensions.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.400
 And so the Arabs are always kind of, I would say they were,

41:08.400 --> 41:10.360
 Arab fighters were always interlopers.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.840
 Yes, the Africans are happy to take their money,

41:13.840 --> 41:17.440
 send patients to their hospitals, take their weapons,

41:17.440 --> 41:20.720
 but they were never going to let this be like a Saudi

41:20.720 --> 41:22.720
 or Egyptian or whatever project.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.320
 But then many of those fighters went home.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.440
 They went back to Syria.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.160
 They went back to Egypt.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.600
 Some wanted to go back to the Saudi Arabia,

41:30.600 --> 41:31.640
 but the Saudis were very careful.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.200
 I mean, the Saudis always used Afghanistan

41:33.200 --> 41:34.880
 as a kind of safety valve.

41:34.880 --> 41:37.160
 In fact, they had, you know, fundraisers on television.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.400
 They chartered jets.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.360
 They filled them with people to fly to Pakistan,

41:41.360 --> 41:44.320
 get out and push our and say, you know, go fight.

41:44.320 --> 41:47.360
 And it was one way that the monarchy, the Saudi monarchy,

41:48.960 --> 41:50.120
 very cleverly, I think,

41:50.120 --> 41:52.640
 created a kind of escape valve

41:52.640 --> 41:55.440
 for would be dissidents in Saudi Arabia, right?

41:55.440 --> 41:56.880
 Just send them abroad.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.280
 You want to fight Jihad.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.120
 Go do that somewhere else.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.280
 Don't, don't bother the kingdom.

42:01.280 --> 42:04.400
 But all this became dicier in the early nineties

42:04.400 --> 42:06.280
 when some of these guys came back home

42:06.280 --> 42:08.320
 and some of the scholars around them said, you know,

42:08.320 --> 42:10.160
 let's we've defeated the Soviet Union,

42:10.160 --> 42:11.240
 which is a huge, huge boost.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.840
 And I think part of the dynamic we see today

42:12.840 --> 42:17.400
 is that the Taliban victory is a renewed inspiration

42:17.400 --> 42:20.280
 for people who think, look, we beat the Soviets,

42:20.280 --> 42:21.960
 now we beat the Americans.

42:21.960 --> 42:24.600
 And so already watching the Soviet retreat

42:24.600 --> 42:26.960
 across this bridge, back into Uzbekistan,

42:26.960 --> 42:29.160
 if you see these dramatic images of the tanks, you know,

42:29.160 --> 42:31.760
 moving, a lot of people interpreted this as like,

42:31.760 --> 42:34.680
 you know, we are going to change the world.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.560
 And now we're turning to the Americans.

42:36.560 --> 42:38.240
 And our local national governments

42:38.240 --> 42:39.800
 are backed by the Americans.

42:39.800 --> 42:42.040
 So let's start with those places.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.160
 And then let's go strike, let's go strike, you know,

42:44.160 --> 42:47.320
 the belly of the beast, which is America, which is New York.

42:47.320 --> 42:48.800
 And going back to Milan, your question about, you know,

42:48.800 --> 42:52.560
 what motivates him, what motivated him, you know, again,

42:52.560 --> 42:57.360
 he was not a rigorously trained Islamic scholar.

42:57.360 --> 43:00.440
 And that I think, you know, when this comes up in our classes,

43:00.440 --> 43:01.960
 you know, I think, especially young people,

43:01.960 --> 43:03.160
 I mean, people who aren't even born when I live,

43:03.160 --> 43:04.000
 I mean, they're shocked.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.440
 They see, they see his appearance.

43:05.440 --> 43:10.640
 They see him pictured in front of a giant bookshelf

43:10.640 --> 43:11.920
 of Arabic books.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.520
 He's got the Klashnikov.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.640
 He's got what looks like a religious scholar's library

43:15.640 --> 43:17.040
 behind him, right?

43:17.040 --> 43:20.120
 But if you look at his words, I mean,

43:20.120 --> 43:21.520
 one fascinating thing about this our politics

43:21.520 --> 43:22.720
 and just one thing that kind of sums this up,

43:22.720 --> 43:27.880
 I mean, the fact that on 9 11, we had to have a few people,

43:27.880 --> 43:30.960
 a few experts, people like Burnett Rubin,

43:30.960 --> 43:32.160
 who was an Afghanistan expert.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.840
 So that was one way in which I think, you know,

43:33.840 --> 43:35.280
 I'm not faulting him personally,

43:35.280 --> 43:37.840
 but it's just one way in which that relationship appeared

43:37.840 --> 43:40.360
 to be, you know, formed, right?

43:40.360 --> 43:44.160
 Of linking Afghanistan to that moment.

43:44.160 --> 43:45.400
 If one looks actually, you know,

43:45.400 --> 43:47.400
 what bin Laden was saying and doing,

43:47.400 --> 43:49.400
 people like Richard Clark were studying this.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.360
 There were Arab leaders.

43:50.360 --> 43:51.960
 The Arab press was watching this

43:51.960 --> 43:54.080
 because he gave some of his first interviews

43:54.080 --> 43:57.960
 to a few Arab newspaper outlets.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.760
 But speaking of our American kind of, you know,

43:59.760 --> 44:02.680
 monolingualism, a lot of what he was saying wasn't known.

44:02.680 --> 44:05.560
 And so I think for several years,

44:05.560 --> 44:08.440
 people weren't reading what bin Laden said.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.920
 I mean, experts are reading it in Arabic,

44:10.920 --> 44:14.440
 but there was great anxiety around transiting his works.

44:14.440 --> 44:16.480
 So, you know, we have Mon Comf, we have all this stuff.

44:16.480 --> 44:18.880
 You can buy the collective works of Lin and Stalin, Mao,

44:18.880 --> 44:21.120
 whatever you want in whatever language you want.

44:21.120 --> 44:23.040
 But bin Laden was taboo for American publishing.

44:23.040 --> 44:26.200
 And so it was only a verse though in the UK

44:26.200 --> 44:29.080
 that published a famous volume called,

44:29.080 --> 44:31.000
 Messages to the World,

44:31.000 --> 44:33.880
 which was the first companion of bin Laden's writings.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.040
 So he has a mind conf.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.400
 He has a tight, does he have a thing with you?

44:38.400 --> 44:39.240
 I mean, it's a kind of collective works.

44:39.240 --> 44:40.920
 It's a collective works of his.

44:40.920 --> 44:44.240
 Okay, so he had, well, like a blog.

44:44.240 --> 44:46.880
 Like it's a collection of articles versus.

44:46.880 --> 44:47.880
 Yeah, these are interviews.

44:47.880 --> 44:50.640
 These are his missives, his declarations,

44:50.640 --> 44:55.200
 his decrees, right?

44:55.200 --> 44:57.000
 But I think just in terms of,

44:57.000 --> 44:58.680
 if we zoom out for a second about, you know,

44:58.680 --> 45:00.560
 American policy choices and so on,

45:00.560 --> 45:02.680
 the powers to be didn't trust us

45:02.680 --> 45:04.240
 to know what he was really about.

45:04.240 --> 45:05.080
 I put it that way.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.800
 And I don't say that in a conspiratorial sense.

45:06.800 --> 45:11.080
 I just think that it was, you know, it was a taboo.

45:11.080 --> 45:14.720
 I think people, you know, there was a kind of consensus

45:14.720 --> 45:17.080
 that, you know, trust us.

45:17.080 --> 45:20.200
 We know how to fight al Qaeda.

45:20.200 --> 45:21.360
 And you don't need to know what they're about

45:21.360 --> 45:22.520
 because they're crazy.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.520
 They're fanatics, they're fundamentalists.

45:24.520 --> 45:25.360
 They hate us.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.360
 Remember that language?

45:26.360 --> 45:27.480
 Yeah.

45:27.480 --> 45:28.720
 Us versus them.

45:28.720 --> 45:29.920
 But if you read bin Laden,

45:29.920 --> 45:30.760
 that's when it gets messy.

45:30.760 --> 45:34.200
 That's where the bin Laden's argumentation

45:34.200 --> 45:37.120
 is not fundamentally about Islam.

45:37.120 --> 45:39.200
 And if you were sitting here with an Islamic scholar,

45:39.200 --> 45:41.960
 he would say, you know, to anyone

45:41.960 --> 45:43.120
 which is Islamic scholar,

45:43.120 --> 45:45.560
 they would tend to go through and dissect

45:45.560 --> 45:48.680
 and negate, you know, 99% of the arguments

45:48.680 --> 45:51.120
 that bin Laden claimed was in Islam, right?

45:51.120 --> 45:52.600
 But what strikes me as an historian,

45:52.600 --> 45:55.040
 who's again, looking at this adjacently,

45:56.080 --> 45:57.200
 if we read bin Laden, I mean,

45:57.200 --> 46:00.240
 the arguments that he make are, first of all,

46:00.240 --> 46:01.440
 they're sophisticated.

46:01.440 --> 46:06.440
 They reflect a mind that is about geopolitics.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.960
 He uses terms like imperialism.

46:09.960 --> 46:12.240
 He knows something about world history.

46:12.240 --> 46:14.320
 He knows something about geography.

46:14.320 --> 46:16.160
 So imperialism is the enemy form

46:16.160 --> 46:17.840
 or what's the nature of the enemy?

46:17.840 --> 46:19.160
 It's an amalgam.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.600
 And like a good politician,

46:21.600 --> 46:23.400
 which is what I would call him,

46:23.400 --> 46:27.000
 he is adept at speaking in different ways

46:27.000 --> 46:28.080
 to different audiences.

46:28.080 --> 46:30.640
 So if you look at the context in which he speaks,

46:30.640 --> 46:33.040
 if you look at messages to the world,

46:33.040 --> 46:34.720
 if you look at his writings,

46:34.720 --> 46:35.760
 and you can zoom it out now.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.640
 And we now have compendia of the writings

46:37.640 --> 46:39.360
 of al Qaeda more broadly.

46:39.360 --> 46:42.400
 You can purchase these, you know,

46:42.400 --> 46:45.320
 they're basically primary source collections.

46:45.320 --> 46:47.000
 We now have that for the Taliban.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.560
 I mean, what's fascinating about,

46:49.560 --> 46:52.240
 I think if you like this culture,

46:52.240 --> 46:55.760
 acknowledging it's very, you know, diverse internally,

46:55.760 --> 46:58.880
 is that these people are representatives

46:58.880 --> 47:01.200
 of political movements who seek followers.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.560
 They speak.

47:02.560 --> 47:07.560
 They often are very, I'd say, skilled at visual imagery.

47:08.520 --> 47:10.240
 And especially now, I mean, what's fascinating is that,

47:10.240 --> 47:12.960
 I mean, the Taliban used to shoot televisions.

47:12.960 --> 47:17.960
 They used to, you know, blow up VCR, you know, videotapes.

47:19.440 --> 47:22.760
 They used to string audio videocassettes

47:22.760 --> 47:25.880
 from trees and kind of ceremonial hangings, right?

47:25.880 --> 47:29.280
 That we're killing this nefarious,

47:29.280 --> 47:32.240
 infiddle technology that is doing the work of Satan.

47:32.240 --> 47:35.760
 And yet today, and one of the keys to the Taliban's success

47:35.760 --> 47:38.880
 is that they got really good at using media.

47:38.880 --> 47:42.160
 I mean, brilliant at using the written word,

47:42.160 --> 47:44.080
 the spoken word, music, actually.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.440
 And, you know, Hollywood, Hollywood is the gold standard.

47:48.440 --> 47:52.240
 And these guys have studied how to create drama,

47:52.240 --> 47:53.840
 how to speak to modern users.

47:53.840 --> 47:54.960
 I mean, Islamic State did this.

47:54.960 --> 47:57.560
 I mean, the role of media, new media.

47:57.560 --> 48:00.680
 I mean, I follow and I am followed

48:00.680 --> 48:05.200
 by senior Taliban leaders, which is, you know, bizarre,

48:05.200 --> 48:06.520
 you know, on Twitter.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.600
 On Twitter?

48:07.600 --> 48:08.840
 I don't know why they care about me.

48:08.840 --> 48:10.440
 I'm nothing.

48:10.440 --> 48:12.800
 They follow you on Twitter?

48:12.800 --> 48:13.640
 I don't know why.

48:13.640 --> 48:14.480
 This is no joke.

48:14.480 --> 48:15.320
 This is no joke.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.280
 So they're part of our modern world

48:17.280 --> 48:18.400
 and it's how they talk and it's how they recruit.

48:18.400 --> 48:20.760
 And this is part of the, this is why they are, you know,

48:20.760 --> 48:22.960
 so Bin Laden, if you read Bin Laden, he,

48:22.960 --> 48:24.280
 he speaks multiple languages, I would say.

48:24.280 --> 48:28.120
 It's environmentalism.

48:28.120 --> 48:31.520
 You know, the West is bad because we destroyed the planet.

48:31.520 --> 48:34.520
 The West is bad because we abuse women.

48:34.520 --> 48:37.400
 So in class, you know, especially, you know,

48:37.400 --> 48:40.160
 female students are very surprised to learn

48:40.160 --> 48:42.480
 and actually say, you know, this feminist argument

48:42.480 --> 48:46.120
 is not, you know, we start with, you know,

48:46.120 --> 48:47.440
 this is a murder.

48:47.440 --> 48:49.160
 This is a person who has taken human life,

48:49.160 --> 48:51.400
 innocent life, over and over again.

48:51.400 --> 48:56.040
 And he is, you know, aspirational and genocidal.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.640
 But let's try to understand what he's about.

48:57.640 --> 48:59.360
 So we walk through the texts, read them,

48:59.360 --> 49:04.760
 and people are shocked to learn that it's not just about,

49:04.760 --> 49:05.840
 you know, quotations in the Quran

49:05.840 --> 49:08.320
 strung together in some irrational fashion.

49:08.320 --> 49:11.160
 He knows, I mean, at the core I'd say

49:11.160 --> 49:12.960
 is the problem of human suffering.

49:12.960 --> 49:15.440
 And he has a geography of that that is mostly Muslim,

49:15.440 --> 49:17.720
 but he talked about the suffering of Kashmir.

49:17.720 --> 49:19.600
 All right, so if you have a student in your class

49:19.600 --> 49:22.240
 who's from South Asia, who knows about Kashmir,

49:22.240 --> 49:23.920
 you know, he or she will say,

49:23.920 --> 49:26.960
 that's not entirely inaccurate, you know.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.960
 The Indian state commits atrocities in Kashmir.

49:30.960 --> 49:32.880
 You know, Pakistan is even that too.

49:32.880 --> 49:35.080
 You know, Palestine is an issue, right?

49:35.080 --> 49:37.920
 So you have an American university setting

49:37.920 --> 49:41.520
 people across the spectrum who get that, you know,

49:41.520 --> 49:43.440
 Palestinians have had a raw deal.

49:43.440 --> 49:46.240
 And so it's a, victimhood is central.

49:46.240 --> 49:50.120
 And it's Muslim victimhood, which is primary,

49:50.120 --> 49:52.400
 but as a number of scholars have written,

49:52.400 --> 49:55.440
 and I'm, you know, I definitely think this is a framework

49:55.440 --> 49:56.280
 for what this useful.

49:56.280 --> 49:58.480
 I mean, in this kind of vocabulary,

49:58.480 --> 50:02.080
 in this framing, in this narrative today,

50:02.080 --> 50:04.040
 in today's world, if we think of today's world

50:04.040 --> 50:07.920
 being post Cold War, 91 to the present,

50:08.800 --> 50:11.200
 looking at the series of Gulf Wars,

50:12.040 --> 50:13.560
 and seeing the visuals of that, I think that, you know,

50:13.560 --> 50:15.480
 I think the American public has been shielded from some of this,

50:15.480 --> 50:16.320
 but if you look at, you know,

50:16.320 --> 50:20.120
 it's the carnage of the Iraqi army

50:20.960 --> 50:24.200
 that George H. W. Bush produced, right?

50:24.200 --> 50:25.040
 Or you think of, you know,

50:25.040 --> 50:28.880
 the images of the suffering of Iraqi children

50:28.880 --> 50:31.200
 under George H. W. Bush's sanctions,

50:31.200 --> 50:33.440
 U.S. British air strikes,

50:33.440 --> 50:35.720
 then you have Madeleine Albright

50:35.720 --> 50:37.480
 answer a question on 60 Minutes saying,

50:37.480 --> 50:38.320
 do you think, you know,

50:38.320 --> 50:41.800
 the deaths of half a million Iraqi kids is worth it?

50:41.800 --> 50:44.680
 You know, is that justified to contain some Hussein?

50:44.680 --> 50:47.880
 And she says on camera, yes, it's worth it to me.

50:47.880 --> 50:49.840
 If you put that all together,

50:49.840 --> 50:52.320
 I mean, American kids, and of course, the American public,

50:52.320 --> 50:55.960
 they're not always aware of those facts of global history,

50:55.960 --> 50:57.200
 but these guys are,

50:57.200 --> 51:01.600
 and they very capably use these images,

51:01.600 --> 51:03.840
 use these tropes, and use facts.

51:03.840 --> 51:04.680
 I mean, in fact, I mean,

51:04.680 --> 51:05.840
 some of these things are not deniable.

51:05.840 --> 51:08.040
 I mean, these estimates about the number

51:08.040 --> 51:10.600
 of Iraqi civilian children dead, you know,

51:10.600 --> 51:12.160
 that came from, I think, the Lancet,

51:12.160 --> 51:14.000
 and it came from, you know, those are estimates,

51:14.000 --> 51:18.440
 but look at this point of view of Amman,

51:18.440 --> 51:22.440
 of, you know, Jaffa, of Nairobi,

51:22.440 --> 51:25.120
 you know, just think around the planet.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.560
 And if you see yourself as the victim

51:26.560 --> 51:29.720
 of this great imperial power,

51:29.720 --> 51:31.040
 you know, you see why especially young men

51:31.040 --> 51:36.040
 would be drawn to a road of self sacrifice.

51:37.240 --> 51:41.880
 And the idea is that in killing others,

51:41.880 --> 51:46.880
 you are making them feel how you feel

51:46.920 --> 51:49.240
 because they won't listen to your arguments reasonably

51:49.240 --> 51:52.680
 because they won't, you know, recognize Palestinian suffering,

51:52.680 --> 51:54.480
 Bosnian suffering, right?

51:54.480 --> 51:57.480
 Chechen suffering, you go across the planet, right?

51:57.480 --> 52:00.040
 Because they won't recognize our suffering,

52:00.040 --> 52:01.000
 we're gonna speak to you

52:01.000 --> 52:02.720
 in the only language that you understand,

52:02.720 --> 52:04.240
 and that's violence.

52:04.240 --> 52:08.240
 And look at the violence of the post 1991 world, right?

52:08.240 --> 52:12.360
 In which American air power really becomes a global,

52:12.360 --> 52:15.600
 you know, kind of fact in the lives of so many people.

52:16.840 --> 52:19.400
 And then the big mistake after 911, among many,

52:19.400 --> 52:22.920
 I mean, fundamentally was taking the war on terror

52:22.920 --> 52:25.080
 to some, you know, 30 or 40 countries, right?

52:25.080 --> 52:28.920
 So that you have a more and more of the globe feel

52:28.920 --> 52:30.880
 like they're under attack, right?

52:30.880 --> 52:32.320
 And the logic is essentially, it's not,

52:32.320 --> 52:34.160
 it's not, it's really been law and it's not,

52:34.160 --> 52:37.520
 we're going to convert you and turn you into Muslims,

52:37.520 --> 52:38.840
 that's why we're doing this.

52:38.840 --> 52:42.160
 That appears, that claim does appear at times,

52:42.160 --> 52:45.160
 but it's, if you look at any given bin Laden text,

52:45.160 --> 52:47.520
 I mean, there are 40 claims in each text.

52:47.520 --> 52:48.920
 I mean, it's kind of, it's dizzying,

52:48.920 --> 52:51.120
 but he's a modern politician.

52:51.120 --> 52:54.880
 He knows the language of social quality,

52:54.880 --> 52:56.880
 you know, that there's a class dimension to it,

52:56.880 --> 52:58.720
 there is an environmental dimension to it,

52:58.720 --> 53:00.800
 there's a gender dimension to it.

53:00.800 --> 53:04.240
 And yes, there are chronic quotes sprinkled in,

53:04.240 --> 53:06.560
 and when he wants to speak that language,

53:06.560 --> 53:09.320
 he knew that, you know, he's not a scholar.

53:09.320 --> 53:13.440
 So he would often get a few recognized scholars to sign on.

53:13.440 --> 53:17.120
 So some of his declarations of Jihad had his signature

53:17.120 --> 53:20.520
 kind of sprinkled in with like a dozen other signatures

53:20.520 --> 53:22.800
 from people who were somewhat known

53:22.800 --> 53:24.800
 or at least, you know, with titles, right?

53:25.920 --> 53:28.200
 So as a kind of intellectual exercise,

53:28.200 --> 53:31.480
 it's fascinating to see that he is throwing everything

53:31.480 --> 53:33.080
 at the wall at one level.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.760
 That's one way to see that it's a,

53:35.760 --> 53:39.880
 these are kind of testaments toward recruitment

53:39.880 --> 53:43.840
 of people who, yes, they're angry, yes, they're unhappy.

53:43.840 --> 53:45.680
 And this is what, you know, I think

53:45.680 --> 53:47.560
 for a broader public, it's hard to get, you're like,

53:47.560 --> 53:51.280
 well, Bin Laden suffered, he wasn't poor.

53:51.280 --> 53:54.760
 Like, yeah, I mean, linen, pulp hot.

53:54.760 --> 53:57.160
 I mean, they're speaking to the empathetic

53:57.160 --> 53:58.560
 to the suffering, the landscape,

53:58.560 --> 53:59.880
 the full landscape of suffering.

53:59.880 --> 54:03.760
 It's interesting to think about suffering, you know,

54:03.760 --> 54:06.880
 America, the American public,

54:06.880 --> 54:08.880
 American politicians and leaders,

54:09.880 --> 54:13.080
 when they see what is good and evil,

54:13.080 --> 54:16.560
 they are often not empathetic to the suffering of others.

54:16.560 --> 54:20.320
 And what you're saying has been Latin,

54:20.320 --> 54:24.840
 perhaps accurately could speak to the ignorance of America,

54:24.840 --> 54:28.280
 maybe the Soviet Union, to the suffering of their people.

54:28.280 --> 54:29.120
 That's right.

54:29.120 --> 54:32.680
 And I mean, if you look at the speeches

54:32.680 --> 54:37.200
 and the ideas that are public of Hitler in the 1930s,

54:37.200 --> 54:42.200
 he spoke quite accurately to the injustice

54:42.600 --> 54:46.040
 and maybe the suffering of the German people.

54:46.040 --> 54:49.440
 I mean, charismatic politicians are good

54:49.440 --> 54:50.800
 at telling accurate stories.

54:50.800 --> 54:55.600
 It's not all fabricated, but they emphasize certain aspects.

54:55.600 --> 54:58.400
 And then the problem part is the actions

54:58.400 --> 55:00.280
 you should take based on that.

55:00.280 --> 55:03.640
 So the narratives and the stories

55:03.640 --> 55:06.720
 may be grounded in historical accuracy.

55:06.720 --> 55:11.720
 The actions then cross the line, the ethical line.

55:11.840 --> 55:13.800
 I find that too, I mean, it's a, again,

55:13.800 --> 55:14.800
 if you pick up just one of these texts,

55:14.800 --> 55:16.000
 I mean, it's a claudoscope.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.480
 So the Hitler analogy is interesting

55:18.480 --> 55:21.200
 because it's, you know, Hitler spoke to,

55:21.200 --> 55:23.400
 he could speak to things like inflation, right?

55:23.400 --> 55:26.280
 Which really existed, but he also appealed

55:26.280 --> 55:29.920
 to the irrational emotions of Germans, right?

55:29.920 --> 55:34.920
 He sought out scapegoats, you know, Jews, Roma,

55:35.400 --> 55:37.960
 disabled people, homosexuals, and so on, right?

55:37.960 --> 55:40.120
 I mean, that's also there in Bin Laden too.

55:40.120 --> 55:44.000
 I mean, daddy of, you know, an anti semitism,

55:44.880 --> 55:47.600
 the constant flagging of Zionists and crusaders.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.680
 It's a kind of shotgun approach to a search for followers.

55:50.680 --> 55:53.120
 But I also hasten to add that it's

55:53.120 --> 55:55.560
 for all of the things that we could take off saying,

55:55.560 --> 55:58.320
 well, yes, Kashmiris have suffered,

55:58.320 --> 55:59.960
 Chechens have suffered, and so on.

56:01.240 --> 56:04.280
 Bin Ladenism never became a mass movement.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.640
 I mean, it never really, I think the,

56:08.000 --> 56:09.720
 I mean, this is the encouraging thing, right?

56:09.720 --> 56:11.400
 About ideology.

56:11.400 --> 56:14.800
 I mean, I think the blood on his hands

56:14.800 --> 56:18.040
 always limited his appeal among Muslims and others.

56:19.520 --> 56:21.080
 But Bin Laden did have, I mean, he had a,

56:21.080 --> 56:24.720
 there's a great book by a great scholar at UC San Diego,

56:25.800 --> 56:27.880
 Jeremy Prestholt, who read a great book

56:27.880 --> 56:31.760
 about global icons in which he has Bin Laden.

56:31.760 --> 56:35.640
 He has Bob Marley.

56:35.640 --> 56:38.000
 He has Tupac.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.760
 You know, he asked why, you know, when he's doing research

56:41.760 --> 56:43.920
 in East Africa, why did he see young kids

56:43.920 --> 56:46.240
 wearing Bin Laden shirts?

56:46.240 --> 56:48.120
 They're also wearing like Tupac shirts.

56:48.120 --> 56:49.960
 They're wearing Bin Bob Marley shirts.

56:49.960 --> 56:52.720
 And basically it's a way of looking at

56:52.720 --> 56:57.720
 a kind of partial embrace of some aspects

56:57.920 --> 57:01.760
 of the rebelliousness of some of these figures,

57:01.760 --> 57:05.240
 some of the time by some people under certain conditions.

57:05.240 --> 57:06.440
 Well, the terrifying thing to me.

57:06.440 --> 57:08.720
 So yeah, there is a longing in the human heart

57:08.720 --> 57:12.320
 to belong to a group and a charismatic leader

57:12.320 --> 57:16.080
 somehow, especially when you're young,

57:16.080 --> 57:17.880
 just a catalyst for all of that.

57:17.880 --> 57:22.880
 And I tend to think that perhaps it's actually hard

57:22.880 --> 57:26.720
 to be a Hitler, so a leader so charismatic

57:26.720 --> 57:29.520
 that he can rattle a nation to war.

57:29.520 --> 57:32.520
 And Bin Laden, perhaps we're lucky,

57:32.520 --> 57:35.520
 was not sufficiently charismatic.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.680
 I feel like if his writing was better,

57:37.680 --> 57:39.520
 if his speeches were better,

57:39.520 --> 57:41.640
 if his ideas were stronger,

57:42.840 --> 57:45.960
 but it's like more viral,

57:45.960 --> 57:48.760
 and then there would be more people

57:48.760 --> 57:52.520
 kind of young people uniting around him.

57:52.520 --> 57:56.160
 So in some sense, it's almost like accidents of history

57:56.160 --> 57:58.200
 of just how much charisma,

57:58.200 --> 58:01.280
 how much charisma a particular evil person has

58:01.280 --> 58:03.160
 for a person like Bin Laden.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.640
 I think it's fair, evil works, I think.

58:05.640 --> 58:07.360
 Do you think Bin Laden is evil?

58:07.360 --> 58:09.880
 Oh yeah, yeah, I mean, he was a mass murderer.

58:11.080 --> 58:13.680
 I'm just saying that his ideas were,

58:13.680 --> 58:17.640
 they're more complex than we've tended to acknowledge.

58:17.640 --> 58:21.960
 They have a wider potential resonance

58:21.960 --> 58:23.320
 than we would acknowledge.

58:23.320 --> 58:27.160
 I mean, and also I guess one fundamental point

58:27.160 --> 58:31.680
 is that thinking about the complexity of Bin Laden

58:31.680 --> 58:34.560
 is also a way of removing him from Islam.

58:35.560 --> 58:36.760
 He is not an Islamic thinker.

58:36.760 --> 58:41.280
 He is a cosmopolitan thinker who plays

58:41.280 --> 58:43.240
 in all kinds of modern ideologies,

58:43.240 --> 58:45.720
 which have proven to mobilize people in the past, right?

58:45.720 --> 58:50.720
 So antisemitism, populism, environmentalism,

58:51.920 --> 58:56.400
 and the urging to do something about humanity,

58:56.400 --> 58:57.800
 do something about suffering.

58:57.800 --> 58:59.120
 That's why I think the actual,

58:59.120 --> 59:01.000
 you ask about what motivates people to do this kind of stuff.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.400
 I think that's why if one goes below the level of leadership,

59:04.400 --> 59:05.720
 and this is being reported,

59:05.720 --> 59:09.240
 if you look at the trial ongoing now in Paris

59:09.240 --> 59:14.240
 of the Bataclan murders, I think, the court allowed

59:15.080 --> 59:17.640
 some discussion of the backgrounds of the accused,

59:17.640 --> 59:20.360
 and they come from different backgrounds,

59:20.360 --> 59:22.040
 but if there's any common bond,

59:22.040 --> 59:26.160
 it's kind of that they had some background in petty crime.

59:26.160 --> 59:28.280
 Famously in the 7.7 bombings in London,

59:29.240 --> 59:32.560
 the Metropolitan Police, UK authorities

59:32.560 --> 59:34.520
 looked at all those guys,

59:34.520 --> 59:36.920
 and what people want is this idea

59:36.920 --> 59:39.080
 that they must be very pious.

59:39.080 --> 59:42.040
 They must be super Islamic to do this kind of stuff.

59:42.040 --> 59:43.560
 They must be fanatical true believers,

59:43.560 --> 59:45.360
 but what they found with those guys

59:45.360 --> 59:50.000
 was that some were nominally Muslim,

59:50.000 --> 59:51.720
 some went to mosques, some didn't.

59:53.320 --> 59:57.640
 Some were single young guys with like criminal backgrounds.

59:57.640 --> 1:00:01.920
 Some were like, sorry, they were kind of misfits

1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:04.400
 who never succeeded in anything,

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:06.480
 but others had at least one thing,

1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:10.480
 had a wife and family who he would owed and orphaned.

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:12.840
 And so there's no, I mean, for policing,

1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:15.160
 I mean, if you're looking at the Bataclan's,

1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:17.560
 there is no kind of typology

1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:20.120
 that will predict who will become violent.

1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:22.160
 And that's why I think we have to move beyond

1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:24.400
 thinking about religious augmentation narrowly

1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:27.280
 or by itself and think about things like geopolitics,

1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:30.920
 thinking about how people respond to inequality,

1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:35.920
 the existential threat of climate crisis,

1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:39.960
 of a whole host of matters and think about,

1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:42.040
 this is a mode of political contestation.

1:00:42.040 --> 1:00:43.520
 I mean, it's a violent one, it's one I can do,

1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:45.160
 it is evil, right?

1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:46.720
 But these are people that are,

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:47.720
 they're trying to be political,

1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:49.760
 they're trying to change things in some way.

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.440
 It's not narrowly about like,

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:54.160
 I don't know, impose sharia law on you,

1:00:54.160 --> 1:00:57.200
 you must wear a veil, you must eat this kind of food,

1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:59.320
 it's not that parochial.

1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:00.960
 But what went, another quick thought

1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:03.320
 about your interesting claim about charisma in this,

1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:06.800
 I think that the one self limiting feature

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:11.040
 of this subculture is that definitely,

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:13.920
 I mentioned the enigma of not wanting to be seen

1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:17.400
 and that the kind of invisibility

1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:19.680
 is a productive force of a power,

1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:23.320
 you know, which a colleague of mine who knows

1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:25.400
 ancient history far better than I,

1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:26.360
 you know, so this is, you know,

1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:29.360
 when she looked at Malomar initially

1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:30.600
 or we time up in Laden, I mean,

1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:34.880
 this kind of studied posture of staying in the shadows,

1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:37.960
 you know, is also a source of authority potentially

1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:41.120
 because it, it invites the idea,

1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:42.800
 and it's partly dictatorships too as well.

1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:45.760
 I mean, it invites the idea that someone's working

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:47.800
 and maybe it's the basis for a lot of QAnon

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:49.840
 or other conspiracy today that someone's working

1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:53.000
 behind the scenes and things are gonna go the right way,

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.400
 you can't see it, that's almost preferable

1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:57.960
 because you can kind of feel it.

1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:01.120
 And so not having someone out front

1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:02.720
 can maybe be more effective

1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:04.880
 than having someone out in front constantly.

1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:06.400
 Then the whole. Maybe, maybe.

1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:07.560
 And then the whole Bin Laden, you know,

1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:09.280
 Malomar thing like you can't see me

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:11.360
 or if you look at Bin Laden's photographs

1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:14.960
 and his video stuff, I mean, he's, he's coy.

1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:18.840
 Some observers have noted that he's kind of effeminate.

1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:21.160
 He doesn't strike this kind of masculine.

1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:22.320
 He's not a Mussolini.

1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:25.120
 He's not a Hitler macho.

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:26.760
 I'm standing, might dump in my chest.

1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:29.400
 He's not doing the theatrical chin, you know.

1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:32.800
 The theater people tell us it's so aggressive, you know.

1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:35.480
 Oh, a chin? What, putting your chin up?

1:02:35.480 --> 1:02:38.200
 I saw a great BBC theater person.

1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:40.240
 It was kind of a, it was a makeover show

1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:42.320
 about how to become a better.

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:43.760
 A theater? Oh no.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:47.720
 Just a powerful, yeah, leader authoritarian figure.

1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:49.840
 No, just how to, how to like get ahead in life.

1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:51.080
 And then. Oh, okay, cool.

1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:52.400
 And just like about acting,

1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:53.720
 like how you can act differently, right?

1:02:53.720 --> 1:02:55.360
 So it was, it was a BBC thing.

1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:59.720
 And this woman claimed that, you know,

1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:01.640
 sticking your chin out like a wrestler does, right?

1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:03.080
 Is the most like male to male.

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:04.120
 I love this kind of.

1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:04.960
 Most aggressive.

1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:08.440
 Hilarious analysis that people have about power.

1:03:08.440 --> 1:03:09.720
 But watch the chin, watch the chin.

1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:13.920
 It's the same as analyzing, like in wrestling styles

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:16.360
 that win or fighting or so on.

1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:17.480
 There's so many ways to do it.

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:19.440
 Well, the chin, I mean, the chin is a,

1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:21.640
 could be interesting verbal gesture.

1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:25.880
 And I, I've watched enough Mussolini footage for my classes

1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:27.520
 to try to pick the right moment.

1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:29.480
 And the chin is, Mussolini's all about the chin.

1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:30.320
 So.

1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:33.560
 And I have watched human beings and human nature enough

1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:36.240
 to know that there's more to a man,

1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:38.080
 a powerful man than a chin.

1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:40.360
 Yeah, no, no, I'm saying it's an act of aggression.

1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:41.200
 I'm not saying it's.

1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:43.800
 It's one of the many tools in the toolkit.

1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:44.640
 Yeah, yeah, sure.

1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:45.480
 So she definitely.

1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:47.520
 It's not, it's not all about the chin, but it's, it's a.

1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:49.520
 But that's what I'm trying to tell you about Bin Laden.

1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:52.520
 I don't think he was deliberate enough

1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:54.400
 with the way he presents himself.

1:03:54.400 --> 1:03:55.880
 What I'm saying about Bin Laden,

1:03:55.880 --> 1:03:58.080
 that makes him different from these other characters is it,

1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:01.520
 because he played it being the scholar.

1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:05.600
 He played it being a figure of modesty and humility.

1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:07.960
 And that meant that he was often,

1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:09.520
 again, if you watch his visuals, I mean, yes,

1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:11.800
 there's one video of him firing a gun,

1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:14.280
 but if you watch how he moved,

1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:16.240
 how he wouldn't look at people directly,

1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:17.920
 how his face was almost,

1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:20.320
 I mean, he appears to be incredibly shy.

1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:23.920
 He saw spoken, you know, his voice was low.

1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:25.880
 He attempted to be poetic, right?

1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:28.520
 So it wasn't a warrior kind of image

1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:30.960
 that he tried to project of like a tough guy.

1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:34.680
 It was, I'm, I'm demure, I'm humble.

1:04:34.680 --> 1:04:37.160
 I mean, you know, I'm, I'm offering you this message.

1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:40.760
 And that, and that the, the appeal that he was going for was

1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:45.640
 to see, you know, to project himself as a scholar,

1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:48.400
 his knowledge and humility, the whole package,

1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:52.080
 carried with it an authenticity and a valor

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:55.840
 that would animate, inspire people to commit acts of violence.

1:04:55.840 --> 1:04:56.680
 Right?

1:04:56.680 --> 1:04:59.200
 So it's a different kind of like logic of like go and kill.

1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:00.040
 Right?

1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:03.680
 So he put, he presented himself in contrast

1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:07.920
 to the imperialist kind of macho power.

1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:08.960
 Yeah, bombastic, whatever.

1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:09.800
 Yeah, yeah.

1:05:09.800 --> 1:05:13.000
 So that's just yet another way of,

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:14.480
 and you have to have facial hair

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:16.200
 or hair of different kind that's recognized.

1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:18.120
 We had a very recognizable look to,

1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:20.000
 or at least later in life.

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:20.840
 Yeah.

1:05:20.840 --> 1:05:22.840
 Now he, he tried to look apart.

1:05:22.840 --> 1:05:24.000
 Yeah.

1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:27.520
 But I'm saying we're fortunate that whatever

1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:29.040
 calculation that he was making,

1:05:29.040 --> 1:05:32.880
 he was not more effective.

1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:33.720
 Yeah.

1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:38.240
 I mean, there's the world is full of terrorist organizations

1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:42.680
 and we're fortunate to the degree any one of them

1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:45.560
 does not have an incredibly charismatic leader

1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:49.360
 that attains the kind of power that's very difficult

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:52.480
 to manage at the geopolitical level.

1:05:52.480 --> 1:05:55.040
 Yeah, and we credit the, we credit the publics,

1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:57.120
 you know, who don't, you don't buy into that, right?

1:05:57.120 --> 1:05:57.960
 Who see through this.

1:05:57.960 --> 1:06:00.120
 We credit the critics, you know,

1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:03.920
 barely on, going back to not allowing itself.

1:06:05.320 --> 1:06:08.880
 One of the problems was that U.S. government officials

1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:12.120
 kept kind of leaning on Muslims to condemn this

1:06:12.120 --> 1:06:16.240
 as if all Muslims shared some collective responsibility

1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:17.800
 or culpability.

1:06:17.800 --> 1:06:22.800
 And in fact, dozens of scholars and organizations,

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:25.080
 hundreds condemned this,

1:06:25.080 --> 1:06:27.160
 but their combinations never quite made it out.

1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:29.920
 But it created an attention where, you know,

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:32.440
 if you were avail, you must have been one of them

1:06:32.440 --> 1:06:33.960
 and you must be on team Bin Laden.

1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:35.600
 And so a lot of the, you know,

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:38.400
 I think a lot of the popular violence and discrimination

1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:42.000
 and profiling came out of that urge to

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:45.400
 see a oneness, which, you know, Bin Laden projected, right?

1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:48.080
 He wanted to say, we are one community, you know,

1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:50.640
 if you are a Muslim, you must be with me, right?

1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:53.960
 But I think the, that's where the diversity

1:06:53.960 --> 1:06:55.600
 of Muslim communities became important

1:06:55.600 --> 1:06:57.560
 because outside of small pockets, I mean,

1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:00.040
 they didn't accept his leadership, right?

1:07:00.040 --> 1:07:01.480
 People wore T shirts in some countries.

1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:02.440
 I mean, non Muslims wore T shirts

1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:03.960
 because he was like, he stuck it to the Americans.

1:07:03.960 --> 1:07:07.880
 So in Latin America, people are like, yeah, that was sad.

1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:09.800
 But, you know, finally, I mean,

1:07:09.800 --> 1:07:10.960
 there was a kind of shot in Florida

1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:12.120
 in that moment internationally.

1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:13.880
 It's like Che Guevara or somebody like that.

1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:14.720
 Che, yeah.

1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:16.120
 Che's the other character in Priscilla's book.

1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:17.720
 Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right, yeah.

1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:20.720
 It's just a symbol, it's not exactly what he believed.

1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:21.560
 Exactly.

1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:23.040
 Or the cruelty of actions he took.

1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:23.880
 Right.

1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:25.800
 It's more like he stood for an idea of

1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:28.080
 revolution versus authority.

1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:28.920
 That's right.

1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:32.160
 And that's, and that's the great way to understand

1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:33.400
 Bin Ladenism and the whole phenomenon,

1:07:33.400 --> 1:07:35.360
 but I think looking at the big picture,

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:40.160
 it's also, you wonder, without ever end, right?

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:42.400
 I mean, is that, I mean, that's the risk of being

1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:46.600
 a kind of hyperpower like the U.S. where you,

1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:49.920
 in assisting on a kind of unipolar world,

1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:53.600
 in 2001, 2002, 2003, I mean, that created

1:07:55.240 --> 1:07:57.840
 an almost irresistible target, you know,

1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:00.680
 wherever the U.S. wanted to exert itself militarily.

1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:03.960
 Before we go to the history of Afghanistan,

1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:06.560
 the people, and I just want to talk to you about

1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:10.520
 just some fascinating aspect of the culture.

1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:12.080
 Let's go to the end.

1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:17.040
 Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

1:08:18.040 --> 1:08:21.480
 What are your thoughts on how that was executed?

1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:24.400
 How could it have been done better?

1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:25.960
 Yeah, an important question.

1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:28.960
 I mean, I would preface all this by saying,

1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:31.720
 you know, as I noted, I think the war was a mistake.

1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:36.520
 I had hoped the war would end sooner.

1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:39.880
 I think there were different exit routes all along the way.

1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:43.400
 Again, I think there were lots of policy choices

1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:45.920
 in September, in October, when the war began.

1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:50.520
 There were choices in December, 2001.

1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:54.040
 So we could look at almost every six month stopping point

1:08:54.040 --> 1:08:57.560
 and say, we could have done differently.

1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:00.680
 As it turns out though, I mean, the way it played out,

1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:02.360
 you know, it's been catastrophic.

1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:06.560
 And I think the Biden administration

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:12.160
 has remained unaccountable for the scale of the strategic

1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:14.320
 and humanitarian and ethical failure

1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:15.920
 that they're responsible for.

1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:19.280
 Well, okay, let's lay out the full,

1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:24.000
 there's George W. Bush, there's Barack Obama,

1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.800
 there's Donald Trump, there's Biden.

1:09:27.800 --> 1:09:32.800
 So they're all driving this van and these exits

1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:34.560
 and they keep not taking the exits

1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:36.560
 and they're running out of gas.

1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:38.000
 I do this all the time thinking,

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.000
 where am I gonna pull off?

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.280
 I'll go to this empty.

1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:43.920
 How could it have been done better?

1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:48.760
 And what exactly, how much suffering

1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:52.440
 have all of the decisions along the way caused?

1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:54.280
 What are the long term consequences?

1:09:54.280 --> 1:09:56.400
 What are the biggest things that concern you

1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:00.640
 about the decisions we've made in both invading Afghanistan

1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:03.400
 and staying in Afghanistan as long as we have?

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:06.000
 I mean, if we start at the end, as you proposed,

1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:09.600
 you know, the horrific scenes of the airport,

1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:11.680
 you know, that was just one dimension.

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.440
 I think in the weeks to come,

1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:18.040
 I mean, we're gonna see Afghanistan implode.

1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:22.640
 There are lots of signs that malnutrition, hunger,

1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:27.000
 starvation are going to claim tens of thousands,

1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.520
 maybe hundreds of thousands of lives this winter.

1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:33.080
 And I think there is really nothing,

1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:38.080
 there's no framework in place to force all that.

1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:40.480
 What is the government,

1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:42.880
 what is currently the system there?

1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:44.720
 What's the role of the Taliban?

1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:46.600
 So there could be tens of thousands,

1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:48.400
 hundreds of thousands of starve,

1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:53.400
 either just almost the famine or starve to death.

1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:56.600
 So this is economic implosion.

1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:58.080
 This is political implosion.

1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:01.520
 What's the system there like?

1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:03.560
 And what could be the one, you know,

1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:05.000
 some inkling of hope?

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:05.840
 Right, right.

1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:08.600
 The Taliban sit in control.

1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:11.360
 That's unique when they were in power in the 1990s

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:16.360
 from 1996, 2001, they controlled some 85 to 90%

1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:17.720
 of the country.

1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:21.320
 Now they own it all, but they have no budget.

1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:26.320
 The Afghan banking system is frozen.

1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:29.920
 So the financial system is a mess.

1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:31.240
 And it's frozen by the US

1:11:31.240 --> 1:11:33.440
 because the US is trying to use that lever

1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:35.720
 to exert pressure on the Taliban.

1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:39.480
 And so the ethical quandaries are of course, legion, right?

1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:43.000
 Do you release that money to allow the Taliban

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.280
 to shore up their rule, right?

1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:47.680
 The Biden administration has said no,

1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:50.160
 but the banks aren't working.

1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:55.160
 If you're in California, you want to send $100 to your cousin

1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:58.680
 so she can buy bread, you can't do that now.

1:11:58.680 --> 1:11:59.880
 It's almost impossible.

1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:01.280
 There are some informal networks,

1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:04.880
 they're moving some stuff, but there are bread lines.

1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:08.520
 The Taliban government is incapable fundamentally

1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:09.360
 of ruling.

1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:12.280
 I mean, they can discipline people on the street.

1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:14.160
 They can force people into the mosque.

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:17.560
 They can shoot people, they can beat protesters.

1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:19.720
 They can put out a newspaper.

1:12:19.720 --> 1:12:22.560
 They can have their graded diplomacy, it turns out.

1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:23.800
 They can't rule this country.

1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:26.720
 So essentially the hospitals

1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:30.280
 and the kind of healthcare infrastructure

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:35.280
 is being managed by NGOs that are international.

1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:40.040
 But many people had to leave

1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:43.280
 and the Taliban have impeded some of that work.

1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:46.720
 They've told adult women essentially to stay home, right?

1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:50.280
 So a big part of the workforce isn't there.

1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:55.280
 So I mean, the supply chain is kind of crawling to a halt.

1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:58.880
 Trade with Pakistan and its neighbors,

1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:01.280
 I mean, it's kind of a transit trade economy.

1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:04.080
 It exports fruits.

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:06.280
 Pakistan has been closing the border

1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:07.880
 because they're anxious about refugees.

1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:10.880
 They want to exert pressure on the international community

1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:12.280
 to recognize the Taliban.

1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:16.280
 Because the Pakistan want the Taliban to succeed and power

1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:19.280
 because they see that in Pakistan's national interest,

1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:22.280
 especially through the lens of its rivalry with India.

1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:26.280
 So the Pakistani security institutions

1:13:26.280 --> 1:13:28.280
 are playing a double game.

1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:30.280
 And especially the Afghan people are being held hostage.

1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:33.280
 And so the Taliban are also saying,

1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:35.280
 if you don't recognize us,

1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:38.280
 you're gonna let tens of millions of Afghans starve.

1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:40.280
 So to which degree is Taliban,

1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:43.280
 like who are the Taliban?

1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:45.280
 What do they stand for?

1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:46.280
 What do they want?

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:49.280
 Obviously, year by year, this changes.

1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:52.280
 So what is the nature of this organization?

1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:59.280
 Can they be a legitimate, peaceful, kind, respectful government

1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:02.280
 sort of holder of power?

1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:06.280
 Or are they fundamentally not capable of doing so?

1:14:06.280 --> 1:14:07.280
 Yeah.

1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:13.280
 I mean, the briefest answer would be that they are a clerical

1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:17.280
 slash military organization.

1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:23.280
 They have, this is kind of an imperfect metaphor,

1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:28.280
 but years ago, a German scholar used the term caravan

1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:29.280
 to describe them.

1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:31.280
 And that has some attractive elements

1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:35.280
 because different people have joined the Taliban

1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:37.280
 for different purposes at different times.

1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:40.280
 But today, and people tell us scholars

1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:42.280
 who know more about the women than I have said,

1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:45.280
 listen, the Taliban is this kind of hodgepodge

1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:48.280
 of different actors and people and competing interests.

1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:51.280
 And I think, so we have a lot of scholars who say,

1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:54.280
 listen, it's polycentric.

1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:57.280
 It's got people in this city and that city and so on.

1:14:57.280 --> 1:14:59.280
 I think actually, I was obviously skeptical,

1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:01.280
 how do they know this?

1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:04.280
 I mean, this is an organization that doesn't want you to know

1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:06.280
 where that money comes from and so on.

1:15:06.280 --> 1:15:09.280
 But I would say now that we have a clear picture

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:13.280
 of what has happened, I'd say they are a standingly,

1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:17.280
 well organized clerical military organization

1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:24.280
 that has a very cohesive and enduring ideology,

1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:26.280
 which is quite idiosyncratic if we zoom out

1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:28.280
 and continue the conversation we're having about Islam

1:15:28.280 --> 1:15:33.280
 and how we think about radicalism and who's drawn to what.

1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:38.280
 People throw different terms around to describe the Taliban.

1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:42.280
 Some use a term that links it to a kind of school thought

1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:46.280
 born in the 90th century in India, the Doha Bandi school.

1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:49.280
 But if you look at their teachings, it's very clear now,

1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:52.280
 I think that these labels, it's like saying,

1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:54.280
 you're an MIT guy, well, what does that mean?

1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:58.280
 I mean, MIT is home to dozens of different potentially

1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:01.280
 kinds of intellectual orientations, right?

1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:05.280
 I mean, attaching them to school doesn't quite capture,

1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:07.280
 I mean, your position.

1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:09.280
 It's complicated. I mean, actually MIT is interesting

1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:12.280
 because I would say MIT is different than Stanford, for example.

1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:16.280
 I think MIT has a more kind of narrow...

1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:17.280
 Yeah, I hear you.

1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:19.280
 Bad analogy in my part, maybe.

1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:21.280
 Well, no, it's interesting because I would argue

1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:26.280
 that there's some aspect of a brand like Taliban or MIT,

1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:33.280
 no relation that has a kind of interact...

1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:37.280
 The brand results in the behavior of the...

1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:39.280
 Enforces a kind of behavior on the people

1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:41.280
 and the people feed the brand.

1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:44.280
 I think Stanford is a good example of something

1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:45.280
 that's more distributed.

1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:48.280
 There's sufficient amount of diversity

1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:51.280
 in all kinds of centers and all that kind of stuff

1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:55.280
 that the brand doesn't become one thing.

1:16:55.280 --> 1:16:57.280
 MIT is so engineering.

1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:59.280
 Yeah, I think...

1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:00.280
 Okay, the scratch...

1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:03.280
 The scratch same for two because I think Stanford's more like MIT

1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:06.280
 than you might imagine.

1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:09.280
 But isn't Taliban, isn't it pretty...

1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:11.280
 I don't think there's a diversity.

1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:13.280
 Sorry, just a rephrase.

1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:15.280
 So people say, oh, the Deobandi school.

1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:16.280
 I'm like, what is that?

1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:18.280
 I mean, the Taliban are...

1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:20.280
 They're an ethnic movement.

1:17:20.280 --> 1:17:25.280
 They represent a vision of Pashtun power.

1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:29.280
 The Pashtuns are people who are quite internally diverse,

1:17:29.280 --> 1:17:34.280
 who actually speak multiple dialects of Pashto,

1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:40.280
 who reside across the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:42.280
 There are Pashtuns who live all over the planet.

1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:45.280
 There's a community in Moscow, California, everywhere.

1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:48.280
 So it's a global diaspora of sorts.

1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:51.280
 Pashtuns have a kind of genealogical imagination,

1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:54.280
 so that lots of Pashtuns can tell you the names of their grandparents,

1:17:54.280 --> 1:17:55.280
 great grandparents, and so on.

1:17:55.280 --> 1:17:56.280
 And that's kind of a...

1:17:56.280 --> 1:17:58.280
 There's a sense of pride in that.

1:17:58.280 --> 1:18:03.280
 Pashto language is a kind of core element of that identity,

1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:05.280
 but it's not universal.

1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:07.280
 So for example, you can meet people who say,

1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:10.280
 I am Pashtun, but I don't know Pashto.

1:18:10.280 --> 1:18:14.280
 So as you claw away at this idea, it's amorphous.

1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:17.280
 It also means different things to different people at different times.

1:18:17.280 --> 1:18:21.280
 So saying the Taliban are Pashtun requires lots of qualifiers,

1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:23.280
 because lots of Pashtuns will say,

1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:26.280
 no, no, I have nothing to the Taliban.

1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:28.280
 I hate those people.

1:18:28.280 --> 1:18:33.280
 So the Taliban tried to mobilize other Pashtuns with limited success,

1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:36.280
 but their core membership is almost exclusively Pashtun.

1:18:36.280 --> 1:18:39.280
 And they say, no, no, we represent Afghans.

1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:42.280
 We represent Pious Muslims.

1:18:42.280 --> 1:18:45.280
 And so in recent two, three years,

1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:48.280
 they've gone further to say, no, we have other groups.

1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:49.280
 We have Uzbeks.

1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:50.280
 We have Tajiks.

1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:52.280
 We have Hazaras.

1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:54.280
 And in the north of Afghanistan, in recent years,

1:18:54.280 --> 1:18:58.280
 they did do a bit better at drawing in people who were very disaffected

1:18:58.280 --> 1:18:59.280
 because of the government.

1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:02.280
 And they were able to diversify their ranks somewhat.

1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:05.280
 But if you want to say August 15 and who they've appointed,

1:19:05.280 --> 1:19:09.280
 what language they've used, how they've presented themselves,

1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:12.280
 it's clear that they are Pashtun.

1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:14.280
 They are male.

1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:21.280
 And they are extremely ideologically cohesive and disciplined,

1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:22.280
 I'd say.

1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:25.280
 So I think that a lot of the polycentrism, blah, blah,

1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:28.280
 some of that stuff was a way to fight a war.

1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:32.280
 They are fundamentally a guerrilla movement.

1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:37.280
 They see themselves as kind of pious Robin Hoods.

1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:40.280
 The rhetoric is very much about taking from the rich,

1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:42.280
 taking from the privilege, giving to the poor,

1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:46.280
 being on the side of the underdog, fighting against evil.

1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:50.280
 And so, I mean, their bag, if you like, their thing,

1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:53.280
 their central theme, their brand, is about public morality.

1:19:53.280 --> 1:19:56.280
 And so their origin story, going back to 1994,

1:19:56.280 --> 1:20:00.280
 is that they interceded, they broke up a gang of criminals

1:20:00.280 --> 1:20:03.280
 who were trying to rape people.

1:20:03.280 --> 1:20:06.280
 And so there's a very interesting kind of like,

1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:10.280
 emphasis on sexuality and on public morality

1:20:10.280 --> 1:20:12.280
 and really being the core of like,

1:20:12.280 --> 1:20:15.280
 we're going to restore order and public morality

1:20:15.280 --> 1:20:17.280
 and how that translates into governance

1:20:17.280 --> 1:20:19.280
 is something they've never sorted out.

1:20:19.280 --> 1:20:21.280
 I mean, how do you run a banking system?

1:20:21.280 --> 1:20:25.280
 If your intellectual priorities are really about the length of a beard

1:20:25.280 --> 1:20:29.280
 and then their path to power and a kind of abstract sense.

1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:33.280
 I mean, a lot of that was very much driven by,

1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:37.280
 if you like, propagating the problems of martyrdom.

1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:39.280
 And that sounds, I don't mean to say that in a way

1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:42.280
 to make it sound ridiculous, to make it sound like it's,

1:20:42.280 --> 1:20:44.280
 you know, a moral judgment.

1:20:44.280 --> 1:20:47.280
 It's simply, I think a fact, it's a fact of their appeal

1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:52.280
 that they promised young men who have known nothing else

1:20:52.280 --> 1:20:56.280
 but studying in certain schools, if at all.

1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:59.280
 But they've known fighting and they've known victimization.

1:20:59.280 --> 1:21:03.280
 And this isn't, I'm not asking for like sympathy for them,

1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:05.280
 but I think the reality is that a lot of the,

1:21:05.280 --> 1:21:07.280
 we know about the kind of foot soldiers

1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:12.280
 they lost families and bombings in air strikes, in night raids.

1:21:14.280 --> 1:21:17.280
 You know, I mean, orphans have always been a stream

1:21:18.280 --> 1:21:23.280
 living in all male society, not knowing girls,

1:21:23.280 --> 1:21:25.280
 not knowing women, hearing things from outside

1:21:25.280 --> 1:21:27.280
 about places like Kabul.

1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:30.280
 And so there's always been this kind of urban, rural dimension.

1:21:30.280 --> 1:21:35.280
 It's not just that, but I think there's a whole imagination

1:21:35.280 --> 1:21:39.280
 that being Taliban captures.

1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:41.280
 And the whole margin of things is really, it's,

1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:44.280
 you know, I think to any religious person,

1:21:44.280 --> 1:21:46.280
 I mean, it's not a bizarre idea.

1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:50.280
 I mean, it animates, I mean, so many global traditions.

1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:54.280
 But you try to tell like an army colonel,

1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:56.280
 if you were to have a conversation with, you know,

1:21:56.280 --> 1:21:58.280
 a U.S. Marine about this.

1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:01.280
 I mean, some would get it from their own religious backgrounds,

1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:04.280
 but I think it's an alien idea,

1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:06.280
 but I think it's essential to kind of stretch

1:22:06.280 --> 1:22:08.280
 our imagination to understand that's attractive.

1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:11.280
 And now one of the dilemmas going forward is that

1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:14.280
 they've got to pivot from martyrdom.

1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:16.280
 And some have been, some have told foreign journalists,

1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:19.280
 I mean, it's good that we're in charge now.

1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:22.280
 We're going to build a proper state, but I,

1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:24.280
 it's kind of boring.

1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:25.280
 I want to keep fighting.

1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:27.280
 I want to, maybe I'll do that in Pakistan.

1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:30.280
 Yeah, I mean, it's nice that they are expressing that thought,

1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:33.280
 some are not even honest, sufficiently with themselves

1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:34.280
 and express that kind of thought.

1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:37.280
 If you're a fighter,

1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:40.280
 you see that with a bunch of fighters

1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:43.280
 or professional athletes, once they retire,

1:22:43.280 --> 1:22:47.280
 they don't know it's very, it's boring.

1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:51.280
 And so like the spirit of the Taliban,

1:22:51.280 --> 1:22:55.280
 even the best version of the Taliban is to fight,

1:22:55.280 --> 1:22:57.280
 is to be martyrs, is to,

1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:00.280
 and to paint the world as good and evil

1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:02.280
 and you're fighting evil and all that kind of stuff.

1:23:02.280 --> 1:23:04.280
 That's difficult to imagine how they can run

1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:07.280
 an education system, a banking system,

1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:11.280
 respect all kinds of citizens with different backgrounds

1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:16.280
 and religious beliefs and women and all that kind of stuff.

1:23:16.280 --> 1:23:20.280
 Yeah, and they've watched in Kabul and other major cities.

1:23:20.280 --> 1:23:22.280
 Some are young, they didn't know those places,

1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:26.280
 but also the very important obstacle for them

1:23:26.280 --> 1:23:28.280
 is that African society has changed.

1:23:28.280 --> 1:23:31.280
 I mean, it's not what, even for the older guys,

1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:33.280
 it's not what they knew in the 1990s.

1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:37.280
 Some always had some ambivalence about the capital,

1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:38.280
 but now it's totally different.

1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:39.280
 I mean, they've been shocked to see,

1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:42.280
 I think to me, one of the most striking features

1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:45.280
 of the last few weeks has been that women have come out

1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:49.280
 on the streets and have stood in their faces and said,

1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:51.280
 we demand rights, we demand education,

1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:55.280
 we demand employment, and these foot soldiers

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:57.280
 are paralyzed, they're not sure.

1:23:57.280 --> 1:23:59.280
 They don't know what to do with women, period.

1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:02.280
 Yeah, and they don't know what to do with being yelled at

1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:04.280
 and having someone stick their fingers in their faces.

1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:07.280
 I mean, this is not what they've imagined.

1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:10.280
 And so I think, and at this juncture,

1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:12.280
 there are still foreign cameras around.

1:24:12.280 --> 1:24:16.280
 So they have committed acts of violence against women,

1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:18.280
 against journalists, they've beaten people,

1:24:18.280 --> 1:24:19.280
 they've disappeared people.

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:22.280
 Even with cameras around, even in this tense period.

1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:24.280
 Yeah, but I think that when the cameras retreat,

1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:28.280
 and that's like it happened, it's gonna get much worse, I think.

1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:31.280
 So the challenge now is, you know, can the Taliban rule?

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:35.280
 And then this is where the diplomacy is so important,

1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:38.280
 because the Taliban can't rule in isolation,

1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:39.280
 and they know that.

1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:42.280
 And part of the success is due to the fact that they were,

1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:46.280
 they became very good at talking to other people in the last,

1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:48.280
 I mean, it's been building for the last decade,

1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:50.280
 but I said the last five years,

1:24:50.280 --> 1:24:52.280
 and they always had Pakistan's backing.

1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:55.280
 And so the Taliban are, we noted they're a military force,

1:24:55.280 --> 1:24:58.280
 very effective guerrilla force, they beat NATO.

1:24:58.280 --> 1:25:00.280
 I mean, this still hasn't sunk in.

1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:03.280
 I mean, the fact that they, with light arms,

1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:07.280
 using suicide attacks, using mines,

1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:12.280
 you know, improvised explosive devices, machine guns.

1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:16.280
 And some, in recent years, they got sniper rifles,

1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:18.280
 and you know, from the summer,

1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:21.280
 they got American equipment on a broad scale, right?

1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:23.280
 They have airplanes, they have a lot that

1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:26.280
 they will be able to use eventually.

1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:30.280
 So, but still, basically, it's a story of AK47s,

1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:33.280
 some American small arms, and mines.

1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:37.280
 So it's very Ho Chi Minh, very old school guerrilla fighting,

1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:38.280
 right?

1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:40.280
 And they defeated the most powerful military alliance

1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:41.280
 in world history probably.

1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:43.280
 So that has not yet sunk in,

1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:46.280
 and what that means for American and global politics.

1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:49.280
 And now they're trying to rule, right?

1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:52.280
 They know they need international support.

1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:55.280
 And their most consistent backer has been Pakistan,

1:25:55.280 --> 1:26:00.280
 who sees them as an extension of Pakistani power.

1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:02.280
 You know, and this is very important for a Pakistani elite

1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:05.280
 that, of course, is looking toward India.

1:26:05.280 --> 1:26:08.280
 They want to have their rear covered, right?

1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:10.280
 They want to make sure that these postions

1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:12.280
 don't cause trouble for Pakistan.

1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:15.280
 And they like, I mean, for some of the security forces,

1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:17.280
 they like this vision of the Islamic State

1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:19.280
 that the Taliban are building there,

1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:22.280
 because those are not so distant from their views

1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:24.280
 of what Pakistan should be.

1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:27.280
 But the Taliban have been smart enough

1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:30.280
 to kind of diversify their potential international allies.

1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:34.280
 So everyone in the neighborhood has wanted the US to leave, right?

1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:37.280
 If we go back to 2001, there were Iranian and American

1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:40.280
 special forces in the North working together against the

1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:43.280
 Taliban to displace them using, you know,

1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:47.280
 Iranian, American, and then Afghan resistance forces

1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:48.280
 against the Taliban.

1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:50.280
 And that was the real moment of repression.

1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:54.280
 If we go back to the missed exits,

1:26:54.280 --> 1:26:56.280
 the relationship with Iran could have been different

1:26:56.280 --> 1:26:57.280
 at that moment.

1:26:57.280 --> 1:27:01.280
 But the US under George W. Bush, you know,

1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:04.280
 devised this axis of evil language,

1:27:04.280 --> 1:27:08.280
 put them together with their enemy Iraq in the North Korea,

1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:10.280
 all that went south.

1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:12.280
 That was the most opportunity.

1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:17.280
 But in recent years, the Taliban in Iran have kind of

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:19.280
 papered over the differences.

1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:24.280
 They allowed the Taliban to open some offices on Iranian territory,

1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:26.280
 likely share some resources, some intelligence,

1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:28.280
 some sophisticated weaponry.

1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:30.280
 And then the Taliban went to Moscow.

1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:33.280
 And for the Putin administration, you know,

1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:35.280
 they've long been worried that, you know,

1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:38.280
 they see the Taliban as a kind of, you know,

1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:40.280
 disease that will potentially move north.

1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:42.280
 In fact, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,

1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:44.280
 Kurdistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,

1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:47.280
 and maybe creep into Russia's sphere of influence.

1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:50.280
 Maybe that's why they have, you know,

1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:52.280
 a bunch of troops sitting in Tajikistan.

1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:54.280
 I mean, the one, you know,

1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:58.280
 forward base that Russia also has in Central Asia is in Tajikistan.

1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:00.280
 And so the Taliban were always, you know,

1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:04.280
 a worrying point, but also useful because they could say,

1:28:04.280 --> 1:28:08.280
 well, you know, in case the Taliban get out of control,

1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:09.280
 we need to be here.

1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:12.280
 And so Tajikistan said, okay, you know,

1:28:12.280 --> 1:28:14.280
 you're helping, you're helping secure us.

1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:16.280
 And yes, it impinges upon our sovereignty,

1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:18.280
 but it's okay, you know.

1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:21.280
 So Putin said, you know, let's, you know,

1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:23.280
 give another black eye to the Americans.

1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:25.280
 And let's, you know, treat the Taliban

1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:27.280
 as if they're the kind of government in waiting.

1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:30.280
 Let's have them go to Moscow multiple times.

1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:32.280
 This summer, you know, for the last year or two,

1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:34.280
 they've been talking to China, right?

1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:39.280
 So the photographs of senior Taliban figures

1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:41.280
 going from their office in Qatar,

1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:43.280
 made your blow to the US back government.

1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:46.280
 The fact that they were able to open up an office in Qatar,

1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:48.280
 at one point began to fly a flag

1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:51.280
 of the Islamic Emirate Afghanistan

1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:54.280
 that basically said we're a state in the waiting.

1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:57.280
 And as the US backed Afghan government failed

1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:00.280
 and failed and failed at ruling too, right?

1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:02.280
 As they showed how corrupt they were.

1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:04.280
 And as they really alienated more and more Afghans

1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:07.280
 by committing acts of violence against them,

1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:09.280
 by stealing from them,

1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:14.280
 by, you know, basically creating a kind of kleptocracy, right?

1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:20.280
 The Taliban said we are pure, we are not corrupt.

1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:21.280
 And look at us.

1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:23.280
 We're winning on the battlefield internationally.

1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:25.280
 Look, we're talking to China.

1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:26.280
 We're talking to Putin.

1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:27.280
 We're talking to China.

1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:28.280
 Yeah.

1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:31.280
 We're a legitimate powerful center of Central Asia.

1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:33.280
 And also kind of, you know, hinting that, you know,

1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:34.280
 we have a website.

1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:36.280
 I mean, the whole digital angle is amazing

1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:38.280
 because they began to,

1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:39.280
 and this is important actually.

1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:43.280
 They had a website which grew more and more sophisticated.

1:29:43.280 --> 1:29:45.280
 Again, after having, you know, shop televisions

1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:47.280
 and look at these kind of ceremonial killings

1:29:47.280 --> 1:29:49.280
 of these infidels devices, right?

1:29:49.280 --> 1:29:51.280
 They said we have a government.

1:29:51.280 --> 1:29:53.280
 We have commissions.

1:29:53.280 --> 1:29:55.280
 We have a complaint line.

1:29:55.280 --> 1:29:57.280
 They lifted all this technocratic language

1:29:57.280 --> 1:30:00.280
 that you get from any UN document, you know,

1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:02.280
 about good governance and all that kind of, you know,

1:30:02.280 --> 1:30:05.280
 generic language that the NGO world has produced for us,

1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:06.280
 right, in English.

1:30:06.280 --> 1:30:08.280
 They reproduced that in five languages

1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:10.280
 on their top on website.

1:30:10.280 --> 1:30:12.280
 And of course, I'm not saying you wouldn't believe this,

1:30:12.280 --> 1:30:15.280
 but it was like, you know, just put me in coach.

1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:17.280
 You know, I know the playbook.

1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:18.280
 I know how to run a government.

1:30:18.280 --> 1:30:20.280
 And look, we have an agricultural commission.

1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:24.280
 We have, you know, a taxation system.

1:30:24.280 --> 1:30:26.280
 And again, this idea, and then on the ground,

1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:28.280
 they had their own law courts

1:30:28.280 --> 1:30:30.280
 and they would creep into a district,

1:30:30.280 --> 1:30:32.280
 assassinate some people, the local authority figures,

1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:35.280
 men of influence, talk to local clerics,

1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:37.280
 either get them on board or kill them,

1:30:37.280 --> 1:30:40.280
 and say, you know, this state is corrupt,

1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:41.280
 but we're bringing you justice.

1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:42.280
 This is our calling card.

1:30:42.280 --> 1:30:44.280
 We're bringing public reality and justice.

1:30:44.280 --> 1:30:48.280
 And then to a broader world, they said, you know,

1:30:48.280 --> 1:30:49.280
 yeah, things didn't go perfectly.

1:30:49.280 --> 1:30:51.280
 The whole Al Qaeda thing, you know,

1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:54.280
 you know, we should be kind of do over on that.

1:30:54.280 --> 1:30:58.280
 We're not going to let anyone hurt you from our territory.

1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:02.280
 We just want a rule and people like us and look.

1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:04.280
 And so if you look in the neighborhood,

1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:07.280
 Iran, even the Central Asian states after a while,

1:31:07.280 --> 1:31:09.280
 recognizing they can make some money.

1:31:09.280 --> 1:31:11.280
 I mean, one of the, one thing that aspects down likes

1:31:11.280 --> 1:31:13.280
 about the current arrangement or they're not,

1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:16.280
 they're not hostile to is that they have all these contracts.

1:31:16.280 --> 1:31:20.280
 They can potentially make some money from, you know,

1:31:20.280 --> 1:31:22.280
 the pipeline dream remains alive,

1:31:22.280 --> 1:31:25.280
 running natural gas, oil to, you know,

1:31:25.280 --> 1:31:28.280
 which is the Indian Ocean to markets, you know,

1:31:28.280 --> 1:31:30.280
 beyond Central Asia.

1:31:30.280 --> 1:31:32.280
 It's sitting on a couple of trillion dollars,

1:31:32.280 --> 1:31:35.280
 probably in mineral resources that China would love to have,

1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:36.280
 of course.

1:31:36.280 --> 1:31:38.280
 And so people looking at Afghanistan now,

1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:40.280
 after 20 years saying, you know,

1:31:40.280 --> 1:31:43.280
 under American rule, it was a basket case, right?

1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:46.280
 There was immense human suffering, incredibly violent.

1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:48.280
 The world did not start counting civilian casualties

1:31:48.280 --> 1:31:50.280
 in Afghanistan until 2009.

1:31:50.280 --> 1:31:51.280
 I mean, think about that.

1:31:51.280 --> 1:31:53.280
 The war went on for eight years.

1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:54.280
 The Taliban were never really defeated.

1:31:54.280 --> 1:31:55.280
 They just went to Pakistan.

1:31:55.280 --> 1:31:58.280
 They went to the mountains, they went to the woods.

1:31:58.280 --> 1:32:01.280
 And so all of these different American operations,

1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:05.280
 as you noted, under Bush, Obama, Trump, and so on,

1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:09.280
 killed countless civilians.

1:32:09.280 --> 1:32:10.280
 The US never counted for that.

1:32:10.280 --> 1:32:12.280
 We never, we never even counted.

1:32:12.280 --> 1:32:15.280
 Trump escalated the civilian casualties

1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:17.280
 by escalating the air war.

1:32:17.280 --> 1:32:19.280
 But a lot of this was like very ugly on the ground,

1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:21.280
 you know, night raid stuff,

1:32:21.280 --> 1:32:25.280
 where you drop into a hamlet and, and massacre people.

1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:27.280
 And then, you know, honest about what happened, right?

1:32:27.280 --> 1:32:30.280
 So that dynamic continued to fuel the growth

1:32:30.280 --> 1:32:32.280
 of the Taliban from below.

1:32:32.280 --> 1:32:34.280
 So the foot soldiers, they never, they never ran out of foot soldiers.

1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:38.280
 I mean, the US and its allies killed tens of thousands,

1:32:38.280 --> 1:32:40.280
 maybe hundreds of thousands of Taliban fighters

1:32:40.280 --> 1:32:42.280
 over the last 20 years.

1:32:42.280 --> 1:32:44.280
 But they just sprouted up again.

1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:46.280
 And part of that was the kind of solidarity culture,

1:32:46.280 --> 1:32:49.280
 the male bonding of, of, of martyrology,

1:32:49.280 --> 1:32:53.280
 of, you know, of martyrdom and of, and of, you know, revenge

1:32:53.280 --> 1:32:57.280
 and a sense of, you know, the foreign invader.

1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:00.280
 And I've heard, I mean, I've, you know, I haven't taught a ton

1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:03.280
 of US military people, but through the Hoover,

1:33:03.280 --> 1:33:05.280
 you know, they put officers in our classes sometimes

1:33:05.280 --> 1:33:08.280
 and met a few wonderful, you know, army and,

1:33:08.280 --> 1:33:11.280
 and Marine officers who I really enjoyed, you know,

1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:14.280
 we came from the South like me, always had great rapport with them.

1:33:14.280 --> 1:33:17.280
 And, and they expressed a range of opinions about this.

1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:19.280
 I think that, you know, I learned a lot from someone who said,

1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:22.280
 yeah, I mean, I get that, I get why they hate us.

1:33:22.280 --> 1:33:25.280
 I get why they're still fighting because, you know,

1:33:25.280 --> 1:33:31.280
 in the week we just killed 14 of their, you know, fellow villagers.

1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:36.280
 So the officers, the guys on the ground, you know, fighting this war,

1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:37.280
 we're not stupid about that.

1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:39.280
 I mean, they, they got the human dimension of that.

1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:41.280
 And yet no one got off the exit.

1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:43.280
 As you said, people, people kept driving.

1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:48.280
 But going forward now internationally, it's critical that they have,

1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:50.280
 I mean, they've, they've had meetings.

1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:53.280
 I mean, what the top line have done since August 15th is the

1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:55.280
 diplomacy. They've had meetings.

1:33:55.280 --> 1:33:57.280
 They've had people, they've had touch can't come.

1:33:57.280 --> 1:33:58.280
 They've had Beijing come.

1:33:58.280 --> 1:34:00.280
 They've had Moscow come.

1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:05.280
 I mean, they've had major visits from Islamabad,

1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:09.280
 from security people, from diplomatic circles.

1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:12.280
 And they're counting on things being different this time.

1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:15.280
 I mean, the first time around, the only people who backed the Taliban

1:34:15.280 --> 1:34:17.280
 by recognition, giving them a diplomatic recognition

1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:20.280
 were the Saudis, Pakistanis and the UAE.

1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:24.280
 And because of al Qaeda, because of opium,

1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:27.280
 because of some of the human rights stuff, you know,

1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:30.280
 the U.S. pushed everyone to like, you know, let's not recognize the state.

1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:33.280
 Even though the U.S. did, I mean, Colin Powell famously,

1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:39.280
 you know, the summer of 2001, you know, we did give a few grants and aid

1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:44.280
 to the Taliban as I kind of like massaging negotiations.

1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:46.280
 They kept talking about bin Laden,

1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:49.280
 but they also wanted them to stop opium production.

1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:51.280
 I mean, Afghanistan throughout all this period we've talked about

1:34:51.280 --> 1:34:54.280
 is the global center of opium production.

1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:57.280
 I mean, over the years, more and more of the Afghan economy

1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:00.280
 continued to today is devoted to the opium trade.

1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:05.280
 Opium, which is the thing that leads to heroin,

1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:08.280
 some of the painkillers.

1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:13.280
 And even if Afghan poppies don't make it to Hoboken,

1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:18.280
 they're not the source of American deaths, you know?

1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:22.280
 They are part of a universal market, a global market,

1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:25.280
 which, you know, I think any economist would tell you

1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:29.280
 is part of the story of our opium, you know, problem.

1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:34.280
 Something I read maybe a decade ago now,

1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:38.280
 and I just kind of looked it up again to bring it up to see your opinion on this,

1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:44.280
 is a 2010 report by the International Council on Security and Development

1:35:44.280 --> 1:35:52.280
 that showed that 92% of Afghans in Helmand and Kandahar province

1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:56.280
 know nothing of the 911 attacks on U.S. in 2001.

1:35:56.280 --> 1:36:00.280
 Is this at all representative of what you know?

1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:01.280
 Is this possible?

1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:04.280
 So basically, put another way,

1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:11.280
 is it possible that a lot of Afghans don't even know the reason

1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:17.280
 why there may be troops or the sort of American provided narrative

1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:23.280
 for why there's troops, American soldiers, and American drones overhead

1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:25.280
 in Afghanistan.

1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:26.280
 Right.

1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:31.280
 I mean, my gut response, not knowing the details of this actual poll,

1:36:31.280 --> 1:36:38.280
 is that that's a very unhelpful way to think about

1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:41.280
 how Afghans relate to the world.

1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:46.280
 And I think it could be, you know, if you go to my hometown in North Carolina,

1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:50.280
 if you knock on some doors, you may meet people who don't know all kinds of things.

1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:53.280
 I could probably walk around this neighborhood here in California,

1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:57.280
 and there'd be all kinds of people who don't know all kinds of things.

1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:01.280
 You know, Kyrie Irving apparently thinks the earth is flat.

1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:07.280
 I mean, you know, so we could make a lot of certain kinds of ignorance,

1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:08.280
 I think.

1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:11.280
 But I think what I would say, and then there's also, I mean, a companion point,

1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:16.280
 maybe, that in thinking about the withdrawal, the collapse, the return of the Taliban,

1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:21.280
 there's been a big conversation about, you know, what Afghans think of us really.

1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:28.280
 And this famous piece in The New Yorker was about how many people like the Taliban,

1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:35.280
 you know, that many women interviewed supposedly in this piece, you know,

1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:38.280
 were sympathetic as they lost family members and all the violence.

1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:42.280
 And the idea kind of was that, you know, we haven't thought about that at all.

1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:45.280
 And in fact, you know, of course, we have, and lots of people have.

1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:48.280
 But I think if you're just dropping into the conversation,

1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:51.280
 if you look at like an immediate arc of coverage of Afghanistan in the United States,

1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:57.280
 I mean, the arc went from lots of coverage during, of course, 911 and it's aftermath.

1:37:57.280 --> 1:38:00.280
 Lots of coverage during Obama's surge.

1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:04.280
 And then quickly dropped down the last decade has been almost nothing.

1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:08.280
 So if you ask the same question about Americans or other Americans,

1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:09.280
 I'm not sure what they would say to you,

1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:13.280
 what percentage would actually know why the US is in X, Y or Z either, right?

1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:16.280
 But on the Afghan side, just to return to that for a moment,

1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:19.280
 I think that, you know, we can fetishize these provinces.

1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:23.280
 They are a kind of, you know, a place where Taliban support has been greatest.

1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:25.280
 Also where there's been the most violence,

1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:30.280
 where the Americans have been most committed to trying to root out the Taliban movement.

1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:34.280
 Where, exactly in the south, in the south of Afghanistan.

1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:39.280
 Yeah. And it's mostly Pashtun, not exclusively, but mostly Pashtun, you know, mostly rural.

1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:40.280
 What is Pashtun?

1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:44.280
 That's the other group, you know, that the Taliban claim to represent, right?

1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:45.280
 So they are this group.

1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:46.280
 What other groups are there?

1:38:46.280 --> 1:38:47.280
 Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry.

1:38:47.280 --> 1:38:51.280
 So in cities, you'll find everything, right, that is an Afghanistan.

1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:55.280
 You'll find Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras.

1:38:55.280 --> 1:39:00.280
 These are people who, you know, Uzbek is a Turkic language, right?

1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:06.280
 Most Uzbeks live in Uzbekistan, but they form majorities in some northern parts of the city.

1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:08.280
 I'm sorry, of the country of Afghanistan.

1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:14.280
 But what I emphasize is that, and you can find online an ethnographic map of Afghanistan,

1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:18.280
 and you'll see green where Pashtuns live, red where Hazaras live,

1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:22.280
 orange Uzbeks live, you know, purple where Tajiks live.

1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:25.280
 And then there are a bunch of other smaller groups of different kinds.

1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:30.280
 You know, there are Norsanis, there are Baluch.

1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:32.280
 There are different religious communities.

1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:34.280
 There are Sunni Shia, different kinds of Shia.

1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:36.280
 What are the key differences between them?

1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:41.280
 Is it religious basis from the origins of where they immigrated from?

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:43.280
 And how different are they?

1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:46.280
 Yeah. So they're all, I mean, they're all indigenous, I think.

1:39:46.280 --> 1:39:49.280
 I mean, there's a kind of mythology that some groups have been there longer, right?

1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:54.280
 So they have a greater claim to power, but historically, I mean, it's like, you know,

1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:58.280
 at the groups anywhere, people have different narratives about themselves.

1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:03.280
 But many, many Pashtuns would tell you, not all, but many would say,

1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:05.280
 we are the kind of state builders of Afghanistan.

1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:11.280
 The dynasty that ruled much of the space that was born in the mid 18th century,

1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:18.280
 that ruled until 1973, more or less, generalizing, you know, was a Pashtun dynasty.

1:40:18.280 --> 1:40:23.280
 The Taliban have definitely said to some audiences, we are the rifle rulers

1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:26.280
 because we are Pashtun.

1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:31.280
 The trick though is, I don't mean to be evasive, but just to get evasive on the complexity,

1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:34.280
 one quick answer as well, there are majorities and minorities.

1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:37.280
 I mean, one finds that a lot along with those maps.

1:40:37.280 --> 1:40:43.280
 But I would say suspend any firm belief in that because that could be entirely wrong.

1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:47.280
 In fact, there's never been a modern sense of Afghanistan.

1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:51.280
 So when journalists say Pashtuns are a majority, or they're the biggest group,

1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:53.280
 I would say not so fast.

1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:57.280
 I would say not so fast because of migration is one major issue.

1:40:57.280 --> 1:41:00.280
 No major modern census.

1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:03.280
 Actually, the Soviets got pretty close, but didn't quite, you know,

1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:05.280
 find something comprehensive and didn't publicize it,

1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:08.280
 knowing that it was, you know, in modern times,

1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:11.280
 ethnicity can be the source of political mobilization.

1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:15.280
 It's not, it's not innately so, but it's been part of the story.

1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:17.280
 There's a lot of mixed families, right?

1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:20.280
 So a lot of people you'll meet, you'll encounter in the diaspora and around.

1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:26.280
 I mean, well, I am, you know, my one parent is Tajik, one is Pashtun, right?

1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:30.280
 Or I'm Pashtun, as I mentioned before, but I don't speak Pashto, right?

1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:35.280
 Or I am Hazara, but you read about us as Shii Hazaras.

1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:39.280
 In fact, I'm a Suni Hazara, or I'm a secular Hazara, or I'm an atheist Hazara.

1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:42.280
 I mean, everything's possible, right?

1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:49.280
 And one of my friends, if he were here, he'd say, I'm Kabuli, you know, I'm from Kabul.

1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:52.280
 So if you think about it in Russian terms, you know, it means a lot.

1:41:52.280 --> 1:41:57.280
 If you're a Moskvich, you know, if you're from Pizder or Moskva, I mean, you know.

1:41:57.280 --> 1:42:04.280
 Yeah, well, even here, there's Bostonians, Texans, Californians.

1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:07.280
 Yeah, East Coast, West Coast, all that stuff.

1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:09.280
 Those are all part of the mix here.

1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:17.280
 You ask about Kandahar and Helmand, and I would say, yeah, if you go out to, you know, a pomegranate, you know, field,

1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:24.280
 you'll meet a guy who may reckon time differently from you and me, who may not be literate,

1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:27.280
 he may not have ever had a geography lesson.

1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:38.280
 But if you go one door over, you may meet a guy who, you know, his life path is taking him to live in, you know, six countries.

1:42:38.280 --> 1:42:40.280
 And he may speak five languages.

1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:44.280
 And these are all things I'm not saying they're all these are just because people have money can go fly around.

1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:48.280
 I mean, they're people who are displaced by war from late 1970s, right?

1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:55.280
 Even already in the early 70s, people were traveling by the tens of thousands to Iran, you know, as labor migrants.

1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:59.280
 And once you get to Iran, once you get to Pakistan, once you get to Uzbekistan,

1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:02.280
 you then connect to all kinds of cosmopolitan cultures.

1:43:02.280 --> 1:43:08.280
 In fact, I think one of the themes of the book, you know, that you may have read, it may put you to sleep, you know,

1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:12.280
 Afghanistan Modern was about, you know, conceptualizing Afghanistan as a cosmopolitan place where

1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:15.280
 for centuries, people went on the move and trade in this area.

1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:21.280
 You think of, you know, I think this mischaracterization of places like Helmand and Konhar, you know, you fly in,

1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:26.280
 or you're part of a marine battalion, and you see people there and they look different.

1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:33.280
 And I think in our imagination, if I can generalize, you know, they look like they've been there for millennia, right?

1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:38.280
 The dress or whatever, right? You think of technology, you think of the mud compounds and so on.

1:43:38.280 --> 1:43:43.280
 You think of, you know, animal drawn transportation, that kind of stuff, right?

1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:46.280
 Or the motorbike, right? At most is what they have.

1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:52.280
 But in fact, if you follow those families, their trade is taking them to Northern India for centuries, right?

1:43:52.280 --> 1:43:56.280
 Their trade is connected them to cosmopolitan centers.

1:43:56.280 --> 1:44:01.280
 You know, say they have a scholar in the family, that scholar may have studied all of the Middle East, South Asia, right?

1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:05.280
 You know, their ancestors may have been horse traders who went all the way to Moscow, right?

1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:12.280
 I mean, we have the historical records of all these people traveling across Eurasia, pursuing all kinds of livelihoods.

1:44:12.280 --> 1:44:19.280
 And so Afghanistan is this paradox of visually looking remote and looking like it's kind of stuck in time.

1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:25.280
 But the family trajectories and the current trajectories are astoundingly cosmopolitan and mobile.

1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:30.280
 And so, and a conception of being a world center is also quite strong.

1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:37.280
 So, you know, another way to frame that question about like, do they know about 911 would be like, why should we know about 911?

1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:39.280
 Because we are at the center of something important, right?

1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:42.280
 We are the center of Asia. We are the heart of Asia.

1:44:42.280 --> 1:44:44.280
 We have a kind of historic greatness.

1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:49.280
 We are, you know, a proud culture of our own achievements, right?

1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:51.280
 So we're not worried about that, right?

1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:57.280
 That said, I mean, sure, there are different narratives about why Americans are there, why people are being killed.

1:44:57.280 --> 1:45:01.280
 You know, of course, you'd find, you know, they want to convert us.

1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:06.280
 You know, they want our gold, they want our opium, they want X, Y, and Z, right?

1:45:06.280 --> 1:45:16.280
 There was a recent story about a Taliban official sitting in an office in Kabul and a journalist asked him, can you find in this rotating globe, find your country?

1:45:16.280 --> 1:45:18.280
 Where are we sitting right now?

1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:21.280
 And he was filmed not being able to do it.

1:45:21.280 --> 1:45:26.280
 And so a lot of, you know, racefiscated Africans in the diaspora were saying, you know, haha, look at this.

1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:27.280
 And that exists.

1:45:27.280 --> 1:45:33.280
 I mean, I think I could go to my Stanford classroom and there'd be a lot of kids who wouldn't know where Afghanistan is too, right?

1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:42.280
 But I wouldn't use those metrics to suggest that this is a place that doesn't have a sense of its place in the world and of geopolitics.

1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:48.280
 I think if anything, being a relatively small country in a very complicated neighborhood, I mean, everybody, every cab driver.

1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:54.280
 I mean, people have a, I mean, you know, this is where America is different because I don't think Americans have this sense.

1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:56.280
 You know, we're talking about Moscow stuff.

1:45:56.280 --> 1:46:04.280
 You know, Moscow cab drivers, I think a lot of them are going to tell you, like, what's happening in the world and why, right?

1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:07.280
 And it's just part of, it's part of their thing, right?

1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:09.280
 You can find that in Ghana, you can find that in Mexico City, right?

1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:10.280
 You find that lots of places.

1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:17.280
 So I think Africans are part of a very sophisticated kind of mapping of the world and where they fit in.

1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:21.280
 And a lot of them, remarkably, he had done it firsthand, which is what struck me so much.

1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:28.280
 And, you know, really, my experiences from the 1990s in Tashkent places that these guys had already lived in more countries than I've ever been.

1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:30.280
 They already knew half those languages.

1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:33.280
 I mean, this one friend's Russian was impeccable.

1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:34.280
 And of course, it helped.

1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:36.280
 They had Russian girlfriends.

1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:38.280
 They had, you know, they mixed with the police.

1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:39.280
 They had run ins.

1:46:39.280 --> 1:46:42.280
 I mean, this wasn't something you got from a book, right?

1:46:42.280 --> 1:46:44.280
 This was like hard knock life.

1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:50.280
 I mean, one friend was from a wealthy family in this trading diaspora and he was imprisoned.

1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:53.280
 I mean, they sent him to prison in Pakistan.

1:46:53.280 --> 1:47:06.280
 And he talks about how he could start like running the jail, you know, taking cigarettes to people, doing little things and kind of, you know, these are not stories of like, oh, I went to Harvard and so I'm so learned because of this.

1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:08.280
 I mean, it's a whole range of experiences.

1:47:08.280 --> 1:47:18.280
 The interesting thing is the survey is a survey and it doesn't reflect ignorance, as you're saying, perhaps.

1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:25.280
 But it may reflect a different geopolitical view of the world than the West has.

1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:35.280
 So if, you know, for a lot of the world, 911 was one of the most important moments of recent human history.

1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:46.280
 And for Afghanistan to not to know that, especially when they're part of that story, means they have a very different, like there could be a lot of things said.

1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:52.280
 One is the spread of information is different, the channels of the way information is spread.

1:47:52.280 --> 1:48:12.280
 And two, the things they care about, maybe they see themselves as part of a longer arc of history where the bickering of these superpowers that seem to want to go to the moon are not as important as the big sort of arc that's been the story of Afghanistan.

1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:37.280
 That's an interesting idea, but it's still a bit if at all representative of the truth, it's heartbreaking that they're not do not see themselves as active player in this game between the United States and Central Asia, because they're such a critical player.

1:48:37.280 --> 1:49:03.280
 And I feel in obviously in many ways get the short end of the stick in this whole interaction with occupation, you know, invasion of Afghanistan for many years and then this rushed with withdrawal of troops and now the economic collapse and it's sad in some ways.

1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:14.280
 I mean, you know, another way to put it is this. I mean, yeah, there's a range of knowledge and you're right, the information flows are are peculiar to geographies and histories and stuff.

1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:39.280
 And I think that you're plucking out one sample from some fairly remote area from one like follow that follow the agriculture products. I mean, this is where, you know, I think urban rule divides used to mean a lot more in the 19th century, right? So a lot of like nuts and bolts of histories about conceiving of these kinds of distinctions, you know, but I think that if one has the privilege of traveling a bit, you see that like

1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:55.280
 urban areas are fed by rural hinterlands. And if you look, think of who actually, you know, brings the bread, the milk, you know, pomegranates and so on. It creates these networks and then, you know, mobility channels, information and so on.

1:49:55.280 --> 1:50:11.280
 But yeah, but your broader point about like the tragedy of this, I guess if I can quote a brilliant student of mine, an Afghan American woman who just received her PhD, who's now, you know, doctor, he's a great scholar, you know, we've done several events now trying to just think through what's

1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:27.280
 happened. And before she's very emotionally affected by it. And she continues to ask a really great question. If I can get her phrasing right, you know, if you think of the cycle of like the top on being empowered 2001, in the way in which that affected women in particular, you know, half African half

1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:43.280
 of the society, right? Then you think of this 20 period of violence and, and, you know, missed exits, right, and repeated tragedy, that also created a space I mean it created a space for a whole generation, it created a sense of space for people to

1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:59.280
 realize something new. And I think so we have to attend to the, the dynamism of the society, right? So yeah, this happened in mostly Kabul, other big cities, Mazar Sharif, Harat, and Kandahar. But you can't limit your analysis to that because things like radio,

1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:11.280
 television, everyone got a TV channel. There's a wonderful documentary called Afghan Star that I recommend to your listeners and viewers that it's about a singing show, a singing contest show. But you see just just personally things about like connections. I mean,

1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:25.280
 it's a, it's a show by an independent, you know, television network that did drama, it did, it did kind of infomercials for the government and huge American investment in it. So it wasn't politically neutral, but it did talk shows, did all this kind of stuff. But at the singing

1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:37.280
 show that became, you know, incredibly popular, modeled upon the British American, you know, American Idol kind of stuff, you know, and you can vote. So it had a kind of democratic practice element. But it's fascinating to see that, you know,

1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:57.280
 people hooked up generators to televisions and watch this, you know, you think of like literacy rates, literacy rates are imperfect. And, you know, people who study, you know, medieval modern Europe, talk about how, yeah, no one could read, and there weren't many books. But if someone had a book, it'd be read

1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:11.280
 aloud to a whole village potentially, or gathering. So there was, you know, some of these metrics don't get what people actually receive as information or exposure, because there's the magnifying power of open spaces and hearing radio and group settings,

1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:27.280
 seeing television group settings, having telephone, you know, cheap telephones, which then become an access point to the world and social media, right. So all this stuff swept across African society as it did elsewhere, you know, in the last decade or more.

1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:42.280
 So African society became, you know, in important ways, really connected to everything going on. And so you see that reflected politically and what people wanted. So you had some people, obviously, back to return to the Taliban. Some people wanted the status quo, but increasingly many more people wanted

1:52:42.280 --> 1:52:57.280
 something else. And one of the great failures was to expose people to democracy, but only give them the rigged version. And so the US, in the State Department in particular, continued to double down on faked elections for the parliament and for the presidency in

1:52:57.280 --> 1:53:15.280
 Afghanistan. What kind of elections? Faked, fraudulent elections for parliament and for president in Afghanistan, again and again, from the very beginning. And those elections were partly theater for the US, like for remaining on the road that you're describing, right, for not deviating, for

1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:31.280
 not exiting because we were building democracy there. In reality, the US government knew it was never really building democracy there. It was establishing control. And elections were one means to gather control, right. But then you had on the ground, especially my young people, going to university,

1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:45.280
 having experiences that were denied to them before, they took these problems seriously. So part of the disillusionment that we see today is that they believe what the US told them that they're constructing democracy. And of course,

1:53:45.280 --> 1:54:00.280
 you know, cynics like us may have been thinking, well, you know, you're not really doing that. You're backing fraud. They believed it when they were younger. And now they're actually smart enough to understand that it's a farce. Yeah. But and so indirectly had the consequence of actually working.

1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:17.280
 And that it taught the young folks over a period of 20 years, young folks to believe that democracy is possible and then to realize what democracy is not. Exactly. Beautiful side. Beautiful side. And so, but now look at us. Now it's, you know, it's now November.

1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:32.280
 And so this whole period, and I wouldn't say like, you know, I wouldn't cast the last 20 years, if you're looking at all the achievements, you know, I wouldn't put them in an American tally sheet like this, something we should pat ourselves in the back for.

1:54:32.280 --> 1:54:49.280
 I think that much has happened actually against what the Americans wanted. I mean, that the kind of free thinking, democracy wanting, I mean, even like, you know, we could point it on the religious, go back to the religious sphere. I mean, the African religious landscape became very pluralistic.

1:54:49.280 --> 1:55:06.280
 Lots of young people wanted a different kind of secular politics. But the old, the old guard who wanted the saddest quo and wanted something that they'd fought for 1980s tended to still get American backing as the political elites who still tended to monopolize political power.

1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:21.280
 So also it was happening in different ways. I mean, the Americans established this American University of Afghanistan, which is I think one of the best things the US did there. And I regret that the US didn't fund 20 more, you know, sprinkling them across the country, making them accessible to people.

1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:37.280
 Because it was, you know, again, it wasn't an engine of Americanization. It was just opportunity. And so the thirst for higher education is really extraordinary. It was never never really met the US tended to put money in primary education, which much of that too was was fraudulent.

1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:51.280
 So you have all this interesting dynamism, you have, you know, the arts, you have a critical space. I mean, I call it a public sphere in the classic European sense, you know, the Africans made of their own. And again, it wasn't Americanization, it wasn't imposed.

1:55:51.280 --> 1:56:10.280
 It's something that Afghans built across generations, but really with a firm foundation among youth, who wanted, importantly, a multi ethnic Afghan society, you asked about Pashtuns and that kind of stuff. And a lot of that language in recent years was they were aware that the US backed government was playing

1:56:10.280 --> 1:56:26.280
 ethnic politics and trying to kind of put people in the blocks and mobilize people based on their ethnic identity. And there was a younger cohort of people who said, you know, we are Afghan. And then there's interesting social media stuff where people would say I am Hazara, but I'm also Tajik,

1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:44.280
 I'm also Uzbek. I mean, it was a way of creating a multi ethnic Afghan national identity that embraced everything. I mean, very utopian, you know, super utopian, right. But symbolically, it's very important that they've rejected being mobilized politically, you know, voting as a Hazara or voting is

1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:58.280
 whatever. And of course, there were communities who wanted to, you know, vote as that ethnic community. But there are also people who said, you know, let's put a kind of civic nationalism first, one that accommodates ethnic pluralism in a way that rejected a kind of

1:56:58.280 --> 1:57:14.280
 majoritarian politics of a one ethnic group dominating the thing. So all this stuff was quite interesting. I mean, women were serving themselves in across multiple spheres. Of course, it remained patriarchal. Of course, there's struggles. Of course, there's violence. Of course, you know, there's no utopia.

1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:31.280
 But the door and all that shut in on August 15. So to go back to the quote that I wanted to offer from the student now professor, was it, you know, in trying to make sense of this, you mentioned the tragic arc here.

1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:46.280
 You take the 20 years, like she asked, you know, why did you go to war in our country? Basically, why did you do this to us for 20 years when this was never about us? And you never asked us if you wanted to come. You never asked us what you wanted to build here.

1:57:46.280 --> 1:58:00.280
 You didn't ask us when you were coming and you didn't ask us when when you're leaving. You just did this all on your own. And we tried to make the most of it. And then you pulled the rug out from under us, you know, at the 11th hour, and returned returned to power.

1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:16.280
 Partly by diplomacy. It wasn't, at the end, just a military loss. I mean, it was a series of diplomatic decisions. I mean, the idea you asked about alternatives. I mean, giving up background, I mean, holding to the timeline. I mean, the Biden people did not need to hold to the Doha agreement that Trump

1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:35.280
 assigned. I mean, every American president writes his or her own foreign policy, right? So the Biden administration acted as if they tried to convince us that their hands were tied. And that it was either this or 20 more years of war or some absurd kind of, you know, false alternative.

1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:54.280
 And so, but I think that's important for American audiences to hear that, you know, they're like, you came to here to experiment. You came here to punish, you came here to kind of reassert your dominance, the world stage, you know, to work out the fear and and hurt of 911 that we talked about, which was

1:58:54.280 --> 1:59:13.280
 so real, you know, impalpable. And it's important for American politics since then. Like you did, you worked out your problems, you know, on us, on our territory. And now what do we have for it? You know, and then the people who who had a stake in that system, imperfect as it was, have been desperate to leave.

1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:26.280
 And so this, I don't know how much people are aware of this, but, you know, I'm a scholar, I work in California, you know, I have friends, I edited a journal on Afghanistan, and, you know, but I'm not a politician, I'm not a soldier.

1:59:26.280 --> 1:59:42.280
 But people assume that, you know, Afghans have been desperately trying to reach me and anyone who is kind of on the radar as an American to help get them out. You know, that's kind of like, you know, the symbol of voting with your feet, you know, is quite powerful.

1:59:42.280 --> 1:59:54.280
 I mean, they, there's a huge swath of society that doesn't want the system, and is literally living in terror about it. Naturally, women, you know, I mean, especially women of a certain age, I mean, they, they feel like their lives are over.

1:59:54.280 --> 2:00:11.280
 I mean, there is an epidemic of suicide. They feel betrayed. And, and some people have done some good things and getting people out, you know, I mean, some, you know, the US military vets have been, you know, at the forefront of working to get out people, you know, that they, you know,

2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:24.280
 they owe. But the US government doesn't want these people. I mean, they have created all these obstacles to, to allowing a safety valve for people to leave.

2:00:24.280 --> 2:00:36.280
 Looking forward, from a perspective of leadership, how do we avoid these kinds of mistakes? So, obviously, some interests, some aspects of human nature led to this war.

2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:37.280
 Yeah.

2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:40.280
 How do we resist that in the future?

2:00:40.280 --> 2:00:58.280
 I guess, beyond my moral and intellectual capacity, I'll just say this, I mean, looking at, again, looking at it from, you know, my home ground is the university. And I think of the, the intellectual, you know, ways of, ways of thinking that, that students should develop for themselves as citizens, right?

2:00:58.280 --> 2:01:08.280
 Maybe that's where to start is like, historical thinking. I mean, these are all, and I try to tell people, you know, if you want to do robotics, computer science, you'd be a doctor, whatever.

2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:09.280
 You should study history.

2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:20.280
 Yeah. I mean, you don't have to be an historian like me. And it's, you know, my job isn't perfect. My profession is deeply flawed, right? But as I get older, I'm like, they're fewer and fewer historians actually like, you know, want to hang out with and stuff.

2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:34.280
 So it's like, I'm not offering myself as like a model for anything. But, you know, whether you're a, you know, you carry the mail or you're a brain surgeon, whatever. I mean, I think it's, it's a way of civic engagement and the way of like, you know, ethical being in the world that we need to familiarize ourselves with.

2:01:34.280 --> 2:01:49.280
 Because in, if you're an American or if you're from a rich country, you know, you need to be aware of your effect on a, on an interesting world. You can't, you can't say anymore that you don't know or care what's happening in Afghanistan or really circle the globe and point of place.

2:01:49.280 --> 2:02:03.280
 I mean, we're all connected and we're all, we have ethical obligations. That's one place to start. I would just say this, and this is a lot for a self critique. And that is so much my teaching and like the themes of my research have been about empire, you know, how

2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:13.280
 big states work not only on big territories like the Russian Empire and Soviet Union and stuff, but the way in which power often, you know, is projected beyond those boundaries in ways that we don't see.

2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:24.280
 So this is where things like neoliberalism or just, you know, if you want to take capitalism or just things that, you know, the idea of humanity or of liberalism or of humanitarianism.

2:02:24.280 --> 2:02:33.280
 The ideas that move beyond state boundaries are all things that we think about as affecting power in some ways that, that often harm people, right?

2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:42.280
 So I think part of, as I've seen my job so far is to think about, you know, building upon the work of my people in grad school and, you know, scholars have affected me.

2:02:42.280 --> 2:02:50.280
 I mean, you know, we're all concerned with how power works and its effects and trying to be attuned to understanding things that aren't visible, right?

2:02:50.280 --> 2:03:00.280
 That we should be thinking about, that should be known to us. And as scholars, we can hopefully play some useful role in showing effects that aren't, you know, obvious initially.

2:03:00.280 --> 2:03:09.280
 So empire is a framework to think about this. And so you think about invading foreign countries. Obviously, if you're a scholar of empire, you've seen what that looks like.

2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:16.280
 And that's horrific, right? You look at things like racism as one of the ideological pillars of empire.

2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:21.280
 You know, that's horrific. It must be critiqued. It must be, you know, we must be educated against.

2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:27.280
 Some of the, you know, gender exploitation of empire is also something to highlight, you know, to rectify and so on.

2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:36.280
 You know, to be moral beings, we need to think about past inequality and the legacies of violence and destruction that live on, I mean, living in the Americas.

2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:46.280
 I mean, look at, you know, we're all on stone land. We're all in the sense living with the fruits of genocide and slavery and all those things that are hard to come to terms with, right?

2:03:46.280 --> 2:04:00.280
 But the last few months in Afghanistan and thinking about empire, I think, made me more humble when I read people who say, to put it simply, have taken some joy in this moment, saying like,

2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:06.280
 well, the Americans got kicked out of Afghanistan. You know, if you're against empire, this is a good thing.

2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:10.280
 This is a kind of victory of anti colonial.

2:04:10.280 --> 2:04:21.280
 You could see from the perspective of Afghanistan that America is not some kind of place that has an ideal of freedom and all the kind of things that we American tell ourselves.

2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:31.280
 But it's more America has the ideal of empire, that there's one place that has the truth and everybody else must follow this truth.

2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:39.280
 And so from a perspective of Afghanistan, it could be a victory against this idea of centralized truth of empire.

2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:43.280
 That's another way to tell this story. And then in that sense, it's a victory.

2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:54.280
 And in that sense also, I mean, you push back against this somewhat, this idea of Afghanistan as the graveyard of empires.

2:04:54.280 --> 2:04:55.280
 Right.

2:04:55.280 --> 2:04:59.280
 And I'll say this, I mean, it's, I mean, I'm a critic of empire.

2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:04.280
 I mean, colonialism is a political phenomenon that stays with us.

2:05:04.280 --> 2:05:11.280
 And I think we need scholars to point to the way in which it still works and still does harm.

2:05:11.280 --> 2:05:15.280
 But it's part of being an empire that you can just get up and leave a place, right?

2:05:15.280 --> 2:05:19.280
 That you can remake its politics on one day.

2:05:19.280 --> 2:05:25.280
 And then because it fails to advance your agenda at one moment, you simply walk away.

2:05:25.280 --> 2:05:27.280
 I mean, you know, we can point to other moments.

2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:39.280
 I mean, 1947 on the subcontinent, you know, the way that the British withdrew played a significant role in mass violence, you know, that the company partition.

2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:44.280
 It wasn't all the actions of the British that, you know, dictated that, right?

2:05:44.280 --> 2:05:49.280
 There were lots of actors who chose to pick up, you know, the knife to kill their neighbor and so on.

2:05:49.280 --> 2:05:54.280
 I mean, there's lots of agency in that moment as there is now in what's happening in Afghanistan.

2:05:54.280 --> 2:06:05.280
 But I think the, the capriciousness, I mean, the, the, the ability to act is if you're, you're political decisions about other people's lives.

2:06:05.280 --> 2:06:11.280
 You know, or something that can be made, you know, in secret, they can be made willy nilly.

2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:23.280
 They really are beyond the accountability, you know, of, of those who are actually going to live with the consequences of shifting the cards on a deck in a way that decides who rules and who doesn't.

2:06:23.280 --> 2:06:30.280
 I would love to hear your conversation with somebody I just talked to, which is Neil Ferguson, who argues on the topic of empire.

2:06:30.280 --> 2:06:37.280
 That you can also zoom out even further and say, weigh the good and the bad of empire.

2:06:37.280 --> 2:06:50.280
 And he argues, I think he gets a lot of flak for this from other historians that like the British empire did more good than bad in certain moments of history.

2:06:50.280 --> 2:06:52.280
 And that's an uncomfortable truth.

2:06:52.280 --> 2:07:00.280
 There's like levels, it's a cake with layers of uncomfortable truths, and it's not a cake at all because none of it tastes good.

2:07:00.280 --> 2:07:03.280
 Right. I mean, I would continue to disagree with that.

2:07:03.280 --> 2:07:06.280
 For instance, I'm still, I'm still working out where I am.

2:07:06.280 --> 2:07:18.280
 And what this moment does to kind of, I think qualify, qualify my understanding of the past into, I think in a moment of humility, you know, I do, and I'm probably, I'm probably reacting to the kind of, you know, as you put it.

2:07:18.280 --> 2:07:23.280
 I mean, the idea that this is like a good thing that American power has been defeated here.

2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:25.280
 I mean, I do think American power should contract.

2:07:25.280 --> 2:07:35.280
 And I don't think, and again, if I had to create a tally sheet of what the Americans did in the US, I mean, I mentioned the American University of Afghanistan, right?

2:07:35.280 --> 2:07:38.280
 It could have done that without invading the country and killing people.

2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:57.280
 But if, you know, I'm not, I've not now become an apologist for empire. I'm not, I'm not now a mini, not a person, but, you know, ending empire is, I mean, it does, how you, does it, as soon as you make or in some ways a continuation of imperial hubris, right?

2:07:57.280 --> 2:07:59.280
 So you're not really out of empire yet.

2:07:59.280 --> 2:08:03.280
 You're not really contracting empire for those who are living it, you know.

2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:11.280
 But I think it's also, I mean, maybe I put it this way, it's be careful what you ask for, you know, I mean, I wanted, I wanted the US out of Afghanistan.

2:08:11.280 --> 2:08:18.280
 But I wanted there to be a political settlement. I wanted, you know, I wanted my cake and I wanted to eat it too, right?

2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:20.280
 I wanted all kinds of things to be different, right?

2:08:20.280 --> 2:08:29.280
 But why is going to Afghanistan even needed for that? You can play all those games of geopolitics without ever invading and taking ownership of the place.

2:08:29.280 --> 2:08:31.280
 It feels like the war.

2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:41.280
 Yeah. I mean, it feels like, I mean, I'm not exactly sure what military force is necessary for, except for targeted, intense attacks.

2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:59.280
 It feels like to me, the right thing to do after 9 11 was to show what was a display of force unlike anything the world has ever seen for a very short amount of time, targeted at, sure, a terrorist at certain strongholds and so on.

2:08:59.280 --> 2:09:16.280
 And then in and out, and then focus on education, on empowering women into the education system, all those kinds of things that have to do with supporting the culture, the education, the flourishing of the place.

2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:21.280
 That has nothing to do with military policing, essentially.

2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:33.280
 But I mean, I think, yeah, if you look at it through that lens, I mean, if any Afghanistan and then invading Iraq didn't end Al Qaeda, it didn't end terrorism, right?

2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:38.280
 It didn't really deflate these ideologies entirely.

2:09:38.280 --> 2:09:47.280
 There were, if you like, you could say there were, you know, some limited discrediting of certain kinds of ideas.

2:09:47.280 --> 2:09:56.280
 But in fact, I mean, look at the phenomenon of suicide bombing. I mean, it spread. I mean, it was never an Islamic thing. It was never, you know, a Muslim thing.

2:09:56.280 --> 2:10:07.280
 Some Muslims adopted it in some places, but the circumstances of knowledge about how to do these kind of things only expanded with the insurgencies that emerged in Afghanistan and Iraq, and then they kind of became connected.

2:10:07.280 --> 2:10:22.280
 They became to the president. I mean, Islamic State is, it's the best thing that happened to the Taliban ever because it's on the basis of its supposed newsstands as a counterterrorism outfit that it will get recognition from all its neighbors.

2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:35.280
 It will get recognition from Russia. I mean, already with the evacuation of the airport, the United States was collaborating with the Taliban against Islamic State and openly talking about the Taliban as if they were partners in the security operation.

2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:39.280
 So, and then Al Qaeda remains present in Afghanistan. So.

2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:41.280
 Trillions of dollars spent.

2:10:41.280 --> 2:10:43.280
 Yeah.

2:10:43.280 --> 2:11:01.280
 The drones up above bombing places that result in civilian death, the death of children, the death of fathers and mothers, and those stories, even at the individual level, propagate virally across the land, creating potentially more terrorists.

2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:18.280
 And a cynical view of the trillions of dollars is the military industrial complex where there's just a momentum where after 9 11, the feeling like we should do something led to us doing something.

2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:36.280
 And then a lot of people realizing they can make money from doing more of that something. And then it's just a momentum where no one person is sitting there, getting a cat in an evil way, saying we're going to spend all of this money and create more suffering and create more terrorism.

2:11:36.280 --> 2:11:51.280
 There's just something about that momentum that leads to that. And it to me, honestly, I just I'm still a sucker. I believe in leadership. I believe in great charismatic leaders and the power of that want to do evil and to do good.

2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:52.280
 Yeah.

2:11:52.280 --> 2:12:03.280
 And it felt like I honestly put the blame on George Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden for lack of leadership.

2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:05.280
 Yeah, definitely.

2:12:05.280 --> 2:12:20.280
 And yeah, there is the military industrial complex component, which is huge. And there's also, I mean, speaking of government leadership, it's also, I'd say the imbalance of power within Washington. I mean, the Pentagon use this moment.

2:12:20.280 --> 2:12:35.280
 The whole beginning in 2001, I think to assert its authority at the expense of other institutions of national government. I mean, the State Department diplomacy has become a shadow of what it was once capable of doing.

2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:47.280
 And of course, I mean, other historians, US historians, which I'm not firmly a story of the United States, but we can go back to talk about Vietnam. We talk about lots of Cold War and post Cold War engagements.

2:12:47.280 --> 2:13:02.280
 And I think, you know, we need a reckoning about how the United States uses military power, you know, why we devote so much to our military budget and what could be available to us if we had a more sensible view of the value of military power of its effectiveness.

2:13:02.280 --> 2:13:25.280
 And I think we need to hammer home that this is a defeat. I mean, I think there should be accountability. And if you, and this could be a kind of opening for a kind of bipartisan conversation, because if you are a kind of American militarist, I mean, you have to look at the leadership that got you to a place where you were defeated by men wearing sandals firing a K47s, right?

2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:33.280
 Yeah, there should be a humility with that. I mean, we should actually say that we like literally the

2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:36.280
 Oh, we lost. You say we lost. It wasn't just, you know,

2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:40.280
 The American military lost.

2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:54.280
 Yeah. And I feel I have very mixed feelings and, you know, it's, I don't know a ton of veterans, but, you know, I've mentioned I've taught my share and have a student now and, you know, they are, they're suffering because they look at the sacrifices that they made that I didn't make.

2:13:54.280 --> 2:14:07.280
 I mean, American society to make the sacrifices. I mean, men and women lost limbs. They lost eyes. They lost lives. You know, there's been this, of course, quiet, evidently of suicide among, among veterans.

2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:19.280
 And I, I've heard some stories the fact that the State Department is seeing a similar surge of suicides because they see their adult lives work collapse.

2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:28.280
 They've seen their relationships. I mean, they've seen, they were seeing phone calls in the middle of the night from people who they entrusted with their lives, who they know are going to be targeted.

2:14:28.280 --> 2:14:41.280
 I mean, some have already been killed. They've seen the, I mean, I think just, I'd imagine just ideologically and professionally what they believed in and what they, what they sacrificed for has vanished.

2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:56.280
 And I think that's a, that's, that's bad. I mean, historically, thinking of some of the precedents you were thinking of, I mean, if you think of, you know, first of all, you know, at a human level, I feel horrible for those people who, you know, may not have agreed with everything they had done and their choices

2:14:56.280 --> 2:15:12.280
 in life, but I respect the fact that many good people went out of, you know, the best intentions as young people to, to do the right thing and make things right. And I respect that. And I've met enough to know that there were people who saw the gray and complexity and

2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:31.280
 that's, you know, all you can hope for. But we don't want a generation of disillusioned veterans. You know, if we look at the other post war moments, and this is kind of a post war moment where, you know, I think we need a conversation with American veterans about, about what they've gone through and what they're feeling.

2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:40.280
 And they have, they saw skin in the game, you know, because their personal connections and their, and their histories and also going to be future leaders. I mean, veterans already.

2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:58.280
 People who have served are often great men and women. That's, that's true. And you know, throughout history, whether you sacrifice, you served in fighting World War II and fighting Vietnam, that's going to mold you in different ways.

2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:18.280
 That's going to mold how you are as a leader that leads this country forward. And so you have to have an honest conversation about what was the role of the war in Afghanistan, the war in the Middle East, the war on terror in the history of America.

2:16:18.280 --> 2:16:36.280
 You just look at the context at the end of this 21st century, how we're going to remember this and how that's going to result in our future interactions with small and large countries with China or some proxy war with China, with Russia or some proxy war with Russia.

2:16:36.280 --> 2:17:05.280
 What's the role of oil and natural resources and opium and all those kinds of things? What's the role of military power in the world? And now with COVID, you know, it's like, it's almost like the, because of the many failures of the US government and many leaders in science and politics to respond effectively and quickly

2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:26.280
 to COVID, we kind of forget that we fumbled this other thing too. And it's hard to know which is going to be more expensive. They seem to be symptoms of something of a same kind of source problem.

2:17:26.280 --> 2:17:38.280
 Of leadership, of bureaucracy, of the way information and intelligence flows throughout the US government, all those kinds of things. And that hopefully motivates young leaders to fix things.

2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:51.280
 Right. Definitely. I mean, I think if there's one theme that jumps out to me and thinking about this moment, I mean, if we recognize that we live in a kind of crisis of democracy in the United States and in other countries that have long been proud of their democratic traditions.

2:17:51.280 --> 2:18:05.280
 If we see them be under assault from certain quarters, I think military defeat is yet another addition to all the aspects of this that you mentioned. I mean, the fact of military defeat is a giant match that you're throwing on this fire, potentially.

2:18:05.280 --> 2:18:26.280
 If we think of its legacies and other post war environments, when the veteran angle is one, when you have people who feel betrayed, I mean, they have been fodder for the far right and other settings. I mean, interwar Europe is very much about mobilizing dissolution veterans in the name of right wing fascist politics.

2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:39.280
 I mean, if one thinks too of this moment of really increasing xenophobia, our immigration debate is now talking about whether or not Afghans should be permitted at all in the United States after 20 years.

2:18:39.280 --> 2:19:02.280
 I think immediately they're sponsored in Europe, which I thought to some extent, you know, focusing on Germany, because it was really ramping up deportations of Afghans leading up this collapse. And now they have been, you know, a lot of right wing center right politicians in Germany have been watching all this with an eye to using it to their

2:19:02.280 --> 2:19:12.280
 advantage for a domestic German audience to say, you know, in the context of recent elections that, you know, we're the party who will defend you against these Afghans are going to be coming from this.

2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:23.280
 So, you know, what I've tried to emphasize in talking to different groups about this moment is that it won't be confined to Afghanistan or even the region. I mean, obviously, malnutrition, hunger will send Afghans to neighboring states.

2:19:23.280 --> 2:19:35.280
 But where the European right is resurgent, this has been a gift, right, to say that the Afghans are coming, they're brown skinned, they're Muslim, they're uneducated, they're going to want your women.

2:19:35.280 --> 2:19:52.280
 And they will take, you know, the odd sexual assault case or the odd, whatever, dramatic act of violence that, you know, happens numerically in any population. And they will magnify that to say that, you know, our far right group is going to save the nation.

2:19:52.280 --> 2:20:10.280
 And what I tried at the main point I wanted to speak of leadership was that I think the serial, well, there were many, many carnal sins, if you like, but if you go back to our analogy of all the exits, I mean, what blocked some of those exits was an absence of truth and transparency and the lying.

2:20:10.280 --> 2:20:27.280
 I think that this is no secret anyone has followed this, but we've allowed, and you think that's the general mistrust of government, mistrust of authority across the board of professors, of economists, of scientists, doctors, right?

2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:47.280
 I think that's the hopeful thing to me about the internet is the internet hates inauthenticity. They can smell bullshit much better. And I think that motivates young leaders to be transparent and authentic. So like, the very problems we've been seeing, this kind of attitude of like,

2:20:47.280 --> 2:21:01.280
 of authority where, oh, the populace, they're too busy with their own lies. They're not smart enough to understand the full complexities of the things we're dealing with. So we're not going to even communicate to them, the full complexities.

2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:13.280
 We're just going to decide and then tell them what we decided and conceive some kind of narrative that makes it easy for them to consume this decision.

2:21:13.280 --> 2:21:27.280
 And as opposed to that, I really believe I see there's a hunger for authenticity of when you're making decisions, when you're looking at the rest of the world and trying to decide, untangle this complexity.

2:21:27.280 --> 2:21:50.280
 And the internet, the public, the world wants to see you as a leader struggle with the tension of these ideas to change your mind, to recognize your own flaws and your own thinking from a month ago. All that, the full complexity of it also acknowledged the uncertainty as with COVID, also with the wars.

2:21:50.280 --> 2:21:56.280
 I think there's a hunger for that. And I think that's just going to change the nature of leadership in the 21st century.

2:21:56.280 --> 2:22:08.280
 I hope so. I think, you know, all the things you highlighted, I mean, accountability is part of that, right? I mean, we need, you know, honesty, openness, and then, you know, acknowledgement of mistakes, humility is the key to all learning, right?

2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:25.280
 But also, I mean, you think just the headline from yesterday, the horrible drone strike, which was really the last kind of American military action on the day that the US was, I think, mostly departing from Kabul, wiped out an entire family, mostly children.

2:22:25.280 --> 2:22:40.280
 You know, the US acknowledged that, yes, this was not the ISIS bombing outfit that they thought it was. But yesterday, they did a quick review. I'm not an expert on drone strikes and aftermath, but those of you who are more closely said it was basically

2:22:40.280 --> 2:23:01.280
 whole cloth taken from what the US government has been saying after all these strikes, you know, reproducing the same language and basically pointing to technical errors, but denying that there were any procedural mistakes or flaws, or it was just kind of, you know, they found little ways of acknowledging

2:23:01.280 --> 2:23:20.280
 things that goes plan, but, you know, we follow the policies essentially. And, you know, that's it. It's not a crime. It's the way of not even saying, you know, we screwed up. And it's kind of the legalese that suddenly makes a war crime, not a war crime, you know, and that,

2:23:20.280 --> 2:23:35.280
 that is, I feel like, are feasible to take accountability. I think people are really sick of that. Yeah. In a way where the opposite is true, which is they get excited for people who are not, for leaders who are not that.

2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:41.280
 Right. And so there's, they're not going to punish you for saying, I made a mistake. Yeah. Yeah.

2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:58.280
 I just had a conversation with Francis Collins, the director of NIH, and part of my criticism towards Anthony Fauci has been that it's like such subtle, but such crucial communication of mistakes made.

2:23:58.280 --> 2:24:12.280
 If you make a small mistake, it is so powerful to communicate. I think we messed up. We thought this was true. Yeah. And it wasn't. So the obvious thing there was with masks early in the pandemic.

2:24:12.280 --> 2:24:28.280
 There's so much uncertainty. It's so understandable to make mistakes or to also be concerned about what kind of hysteria different statements you make lead to just being transparent about that and saying we were not correct in saying the thing we said before.

2:24:28.280 --> 2:24:53.280
 It's so powerful to communicate, to gain trust. And the opposite is true. When you do this legalese type of talk, it destroys trust. And again, I really think the lessons of recent history teach us how to be a leader and teach young leaders how to be leaders.

2:24:53.280 --> 2:25:04.280
 And so I have a lot of hope. Yeah. Good. Partially thanks for the internet. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. No humility. I mean, we need humility, accountability, honesty.

2:25:04.280 --> 2:25:14.280
 And yes, studying the past is an important way to do that. I mean, to learn from past mistakes. And obviously there's always inspiration and courage. And we can take some kind of assistance from that too.

2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:28.280
 But also learning from learning how not to do things, right? And then analogies are never like one to one. I mean, we talk about Vietnam. I mean, I think many Vietnam veterans would say, this is like deja vu.

2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:50.280
 You know, I mean, there's the story, the visuals of the Kabul Airport and of the Saigon embassy. We're not the same, but close enough that people would juxtapose them. All of us right now. But I would just ask people that, you know, overanalogizing is also, you know, a kind of path down, making errors of judgment and comparison and then sameness.

2:25:50.280 --> 2:26:06.280
 But it's stretch. I mean, like 911 itself, I think the idea that people lack the imagination within our security apparatus to think this was even possible, right? And you think of the simplicity of having a $10 lock on a cockpit door, you know, could have wanted all this.

2:26:06.280 --> 2:26:23.280
 And again, I'm not saying out of the time or hindsight that I am on mission about all this. But, you know, I just been living in Germany the year before. And there was a plot there. This guy was hatching from Germany to blow up the mausoleum of Otterswerk in Ankara with an airplane.

2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:46.280
 And so if you kind of dig, you know, it wasn't unimaginable that you would use an airplane as a weapon. And the Bush was fishing up saying, no one had ever heard of this. Who would do this? Well, not a lot of people do this. And then, you know, at that very moment, my wife was teaching the Joseph Conrad novel Secret Agent, which was about a conspiratorial organization that wanted to bomb.

2:26:46.280 --> 2:26:57.280
 Actually, in retrospect, it was kind of suicide bombing, because I think they tricked this guy into doing it, but they wanted to bomb the Greenwich Observatory for some obscure political purpose.

2:26:57.280 --> 2:27:10.280
 So that's an instance in which, you know, the novel, right, to go back to our kind of humanities pitch, right? That is my point was that, you know, as you mentioned, we need humanity, transparency, but also imagination, right?

2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:21.280
 And part of expanding our imagination is by, you know, I mean, obviously delving into your fields, you know, of engineering and the sciences and robotics and artificial intelligence and all that rich landscape.

2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:37.280
 And then, but also we find this in film, poetry, literature, I mean, just the kind of stretching that that we need to do to really educate ourselves more fully, right, across the, across the spectrum of everything humans need to imagine, to reimagine security.

2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:46.280
 You know, so much what we talked about today, I mean, so much of, you know, our security is affected by others perception of their insecurity, right?

2:27:46.280 --> 2:27:49.280
 Which unleashes a whole web of emotions.

2:27:49.280 --> 2:28:11.280
 Can you tell me about the Afghan people, what they love, what they fear, what they dream of for themselves and for their nation? Is there something to say, to speak to, to the spirit of the people that may humanize them and maybe speak to the concerns and the hopes they have?

2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:26.280
 Yeah, I think I, you know, as an outsider, I hesitate to make any grand statement, but I would say listen, I mean, there are a number of documentary films that are incredibly rich that will offer your listeners and viewers a snapshot.

2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:34.280
 So there is Afghan Star, you know, which really brings you to the homes of a set of people who, you know, they want to start them.

2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:42.280
 They're artists, they want to express themselves. Some want to push political boundaries, cultural boundaries. There's a woman who gets into hot water for dancing.

2:28:42.280 --> 2:28:50.280
 But, you know, you realize that, I mean, people, I mean, they love art, they love music, they love poetry, they love expression.

2:28:50.280 --> 2:29:00.280
 You know, people want to care for their children, they want safety to families, they want to enjoy what everyone enjoys, you know, I think it's very humanizing portrait.

2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:11.280
 There's another great documentary film called Love Crimes of Kabul, which is a great snapshot of the post 2000 world that the Americans shaped a lot of ways.

2:29:11.280 --> 2:29:19.280
 And it's about a women's prison. And it's incredibly revealing because it's about young girls and what they want.

2:29:19.280 --> 2:29:33.280
 Well, not just young, but young teenage and then some middle age people who were accused of moral crimes, ranging from homicide, which one moment it gets to, to having such relations outside of marriage.

2:29:33.280 --> 2:29:42.280
 And so it shows in a way continuity with the previous Taliban regime and that women are imprisoned for things that you wouldn't be imprisoned for elsewhere.

2:29:42.280 --> 2:29:49.280
 And that Islamic law operates as the kind of judicial logic for these, for these punishments.

2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:53.280
 But in letting these women kind of speak for themselves. I mean, it's fascinating.

2:29:53.280 --> 2:30:00.280
 I mean, I don't want to give too much away, but women make ranging choices in this film that land them in this predicament.

2:30:00.280 --> 2:30:06.280
 So they don't all profess innocence. Some are like, I'm guilty, but they're guilty for reasons.

2:30:06.280 --> 2:30:13.280
 In one case, one woman is guilty. She's in prison because it's a way to exert pressure on her fiance to finally marry her.

2:30:13.280 --> 2:30:21.280
 So you get ethnicity, you get kind of Romeo and Juliet things where their families don't like each other necessarily, but they find each other.

2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:28.280
 You have questions of love, money, clothing, furniture. It's beautiful.

2:30:28.280 --> 2:30:36.280
 I mean, the parts with it, I remember showing it in class. There was a wonderful Afghan student who was, I think, a Fulbright at school in Stanford.

2:30:36.280 --> 2:30:38.280
 And she's a genius. She's amazing.

2:30:38.280 --> 2:30:46.280
 It was awkward for her because talking about young women having sex and stuff, and it was just, it wasn't, you know, the snapshot of Afghanistan that she wanted.

2:30:46.280 --> 2:30:52.280
 And obviously there's so much more where they're great writers and, you know, musicians and, I mean, you know, music is a huge thing.

2:30:52.280 --> 2:30:55.280
 I mean, poetry, all these things are great.

2:30:55.280 --> 2:30:59.280
 So she found it, you know, I hear you. I mean, it's kind of a taboo subject.

2:30:59.280 --> 2:31:05.280
 But I thought the American students singing it really identified with these women because they're just so real.

2:31:05.280 --> 2:31:14.280
 And so, you know, young people trying to find like, I mean, relationships that are universal in circumstances that are very difficult.

2:31:14.280 --> 2:31:16.280
 Love. Love is universal.

2:31:16.280 --> 2:31:23.280
 Yeah, yeah. So it's, I mean, we do have resources to humanize. I mean, you know, some of your people will know Khaled Hussaini, you know, he's an African American.

2:31:23.280 --> 2:31:30.280
 He's done his stuff, but there are, there are a number of novelists and short story writers who do cool things.

2:31:30.280 --> 2:31:36.280
 And I think that another tragic aspect of this moment is that those people have now pretty much had to leave the country.

2:31:36.280 --> 2:31:45.280
 So there's a visual artist I would highlight for you named Khadim Ali is a Hazara based in Australia.

2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:55.280
 He does extraordinary work in blending a tradition of Persian miniatures with contemporary political commentary.

2:31:55.280 --> 2:31:58.280
 His work is between Australia and Afghanistan, but he also he had to flee.

2:31:58.280 --> 2:32:07.280
 I mean, he was doing some work in Kabul, but it's a extraordinary kind of visual language that he's adapted that has been shown all over the planet now.

2:32:07.280 --> 2:32:10.280
 He's got some of his work is in New York galleries is in Europe.

2:32:10.280 --> 2:32:13.280
 He's been shown in Australia, but he talks about migration.

2:32:13.280 --> 2:32:25.280
 In a way that puts Afghans and Hazaras at the center, but it's totally universal about, you know, our modern crisis of, of all the mains people who were displaced across our planet.

2:32:25.280 --> 2:32:31.280
 And he attempts to kind of speak for some size of them in a way that like everyone can get.

2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:42.280
 I mean, the visual imagery experts will know that it's from, you know, like the, the Shahnameh, like an ancient Persian, you know, epic that Iranians were attached to that Afghans are attached to that people can quote, you know,

2:32:42.280 --> 2:32:50.280
 at length that has mythical figures of good and evil that kids grow up embodying their names, the names of the characters that are.

2:32:50.280 --> 2:32:57.280
 It's called, you know, the Book of Kings, the heroes and villains are the staple of conversation and poetry.

2:32:57.280 --> 2:33:06.280
 And, you know, like Russians, I mean, the kind of the resort to literary references and speak is something that, you know, Americans don't do.

2:33:06.280 --> 2:33:20.280
 Western countries don't do, but the fact that everyone's got to know this character, everyone has this reference, the wordplay, the linguistic finesse in multiple languages is, you know, a major value of Afghan storytelling.

2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:25.280
 As an outsider, I'm scratching at the surface of the surface.

2:33:25.280 --> 2:33:28.280
 Yeah, but there's a depth to it, just like it is fascinating.

2:33:28.280 --> 2:33:29.280
 The layers, yeah.

2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:31.280
 The layers of Russian language that's.

2:33:31.280 --> 2:33:32.280
 Exactly.

2:33:32.280 --> 2:33:48.280
 It's like the culture, I've been struggling and this is kind of the journey I'm embarking on to convey to an American audience what is lost in translation between Russian and English.

2:33:48.280 --> 2:33:58.280
 And it's very challenging in some of the great translators of the CS gift Tolstoy of Russian literature struggle with this deeply and they work.

2:33:58.280 --> 2:34:10.280
 It's an art form just to convey that and it's amazing to hear that I've got to stand with a full mix of cultures that are there have the same kind of wit and humor and depth of intellect.

2:34:10.280 --> 2:34:16.280
 I mean, the humor thing is that that's, you know, I'm so much our visual imagery is about like this sad place and Dower and everything.

2:34:16.280 --> 2:34:26.280
 I mean, socially, again, I'm going to engage in some stereotypes about generalization stuff, but just the, you know, the Afghan friends and I have come to be closer to really love.

2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:38.280
 I mean, the, the humor, there's so much there of common common stuff of like, when I go to Ireland, it's one of my favorite places and just like the, I feel a sense of pressure like the humor all around me.

2:34:38.280 --> 2:34:47.280
 I feel like there's something between iron, like Ireland and Russia with the humor stuff where it's like you've got to be on your game if you want to be, you know, so it's.

2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:49.280
 Yeah, it's like, you know what I mean?

2:34:49.280 --> 2:35:00.280
 The intensity of conversation in terms of, yeah, you have to be on your game in terms of wit and so on. I mean, you have to, there's certain people I have like when I talked on this podcast, they're like that.

2:35:00.280 --> 2:35:03.280
 Certain people from the Jewish tradition have that.

2:35:03.280 --> 2:35:04.280
 Totally.

2:35:04.280 --> 2:35:08.280
 Like what the wit is just like, okay, I have to, oh yeah, I really have to pay attention.

2:35:08.280 --> 2:35:09.280
 Yeah.

2:35:09.280 --> 2:35:10.280
 It's a game.

2:35:10.280 --> 2:35:12.280
 It's like, you know what it feels like?

2:35:12.280 --> 2:35:14.280
 It feels like speed chess or something like that.

2:35:14.280 --> 2:35:17.280
 And you really have to focus and play.

2:35:17.280 --> 2:35:23.280
 And at the same time, there's body language in the, and then there's a melancholy nature to it, at least in the Russian side.

2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:24.280
 Yeah.

2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:25.280
 The whole thing is just a beautiful mess.

2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:26.280
 Yeah.

2:35:26.280 --> 2:35:39.280
 I mean, there's a funny TikTok video that went around it that I got from like some Afghan acquaintances that was a, that he's an Irish comedian, kind of highlighting, you know, kind of Irish and German national stereotypes around hospitality.

2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:52.280
 And this Afghan moment is that, you know, I didn't know that the Irish were just white Afghans because the whole like, you know, hospitality, like politics of like a refusal, you know, you, you know, you don't, you don't take something that's offered you the first time.

2:35:52.280 --> 2:36:08.280
 You don't, I mean, it's the, the culture of, of receiving a guest, you know, that's, you know, Americans aren't, I mean, that's not, you know, that's not always, I mean, the different, the regional cultures or that's the thing, there's whatever, but it's, I mean, the, the kind of like generosity and the kind of, you know,

2:36:08.280 --> 2:36:09.280
 that's, that's real.

2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:11.280
 I mean, that's, and that's a cool thing.

2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:12.280
 And that's amazing.

2:36:12.280 --> 2:36:22.280
 That's, you know, the food, I mean, going on with just the superficial things, but the, but all of that, the warmth of hospitality and, of wit and humanity.

2:36:22.280 --> 2:36:29.280
 I mean, it's, that's what we don't see viewing the place just through war and geopolitics and the moving pieces of the map and stuff.

2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:35.280
 And that's, and that's hard to see when, you know, there are gaps in language and religious tradition and all that stuff.

2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:40.280
 And then, you know, being open to the fact that people do, do things differently.

2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:43.280
 You know, and it's, and the gender dimension there is important, right?

2:36:43.280 --> 2:36:48.280
 They're, they're kind of, you know, arguably each culture has a kind of gender, gender.gen make this different.

2:36:48.280 --> 2:36:54.280
 And so I think it's helpful to have humility and thinking that some Africans will do something, something's different, differently.

2:36:54.280 --> 2:36:59.280
 You know, but then you'll also have Afghans who say everyone should be educated.

2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:01.280
 Everyone should work and so on and so on.

2:37:01.280 --> 2:37:03.280
 So there's no, there's no single way of, yeah.

2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:05.280
 And there is a gender dynamic in Russia too.

2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:07.280
 We need to be respectful of that.

2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:09.280
 And that's not, that's not always what it looks like at first.

2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:10.280
 Yeah, exactly.

2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:11.280
 There's layers.

2:37:11.280 --> 2:37:13.280
 That's where power is. I mean, that's definitely, I don't know.

2:37:13.280 --> 2:37:14.280
 Yeah.

2:37:14.280 --> 2:37:17.280
 Yeah. That's a whole other conversation where the power is.

2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:18.280
 Yeah.

2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:23.280
 Rumi, the 13th century Persian poet who was born on the land that is now Afghanistan.

2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:30.280
 Is there something in his words that speaks to you about the spirit of the Afghan people?

2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:32.280
 I mean, everyone owns Rumi.

2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:37.280
 I guess that's gonna get me in trouble with certain Afghan fans of Rumi who want to see

2:37:37.280 --> 2:37:38.280
 him as an Afghan.

2:37:38.280 --> 2:37:42.280
 I would say, are they proud of Rumi?

2:37:42.280 --> 2:37:43.280
 Yeah.

2:37:43.280 --> 2:37:44.280
 Do they see him as an Afghan?

2:37:44.280 --> 2:37:45.280
 Yeah.

2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:46.280
 I mean, it depends.

2:37:46.280 --> 2:37:51.280
 I mean, some people will be militant and say, you know, the Iranians can have him.

2:37:51.280 --> 2:37:52.280
 He's ours.

2:37:52.280 --> 2:37:58.280
 But they also say, you know, he's, I mean, you can say, again, he's like a Rorschach blood.

2:37:58.280 --> 2:38:05.280
 He's a Sufi. He's a Muslim. He's a Central Asian. He's Iranian. He's Afghan. He's a Turk.

2:38:05.280 --> 2:38:09.280
 I'm trying to think of the analogy, but he's something special to everyone.

2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:12.280
 So I guess I would not walk into that conversation and claim that he's one or another.

2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:13.280
 But it's a cool thing.

2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:17.280
 I mean, it's the, but I'm glad you brought that up because that's a good way of seeing

2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:23.280
 something that Afghans, I mean, we live in our countries in Afghanistan and say, okay,

2:38:23.280 --> 2:38:27.280
 Rumi is everyone, you know, Madonna helped make a famous in the United States, you know,

2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:29.280
 they used to sell stuff at Starbucks.

2:38:29.280 --> 2:38:32.280
 And that's all complicated and embarrassing.

2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:36.280
 And his, his translations are very much disputed where you have people be like, there's some

2:38:36.280 --> 2:38:37.280
 awful Rumi translations.

2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:42.280
 And there are, there are also a lot of, speaking of the internet, there are lots of fake Rumi

2:38:42.280 --> 2:38:43.280
 quotes.

2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:44.280
 Yes.

2:38:44.280 --> 2:38:46.280
 You know, like Rumi said, always be your best.

2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:47.280
 We didn't say that.

2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:49.280
 You know, that was, you know, I mean, that's kind of stuff.

2:38:49.280 --> 2:38:55.280
 But the cool thing is like the, I mean, I think you can read Rumi as a religious thinker,

2:38:55.280 --> 2:39:01.280
 but you can also, you know, read Rumi as a, you know, in an Islamic sense, but you can

2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:03.280
 also read him as a kind of spiritualist, right?

2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:05.280
 As someone who, or an ethicist or moralist.

2:39:05.280 --> 2:39:12.280
 And so I think that's, I like the, the lens of Rumi as a gateway to Afghan ecumenicism

2:39:12.280 --> 2:39:18.280
 and cosmogenism, you know, the theme I keep emphasizing of, of meeting actual Afghans who

2:39:18.280 --> 2:39:24.280
 were actually, you know, fluent in Russian, fluent in German, fluent Turkish, they know

2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:29.280
 Pashto, they've gone to university or sometimes they haven't.

2:39:29.280 --> 2:39:35.280
 And yet, I mean, they're, I like the category of the popular intellectual, you know, the

2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:38.280
 intellectual who isn't, isn't formally educated necessarily.

2:39:38.280 --> 2:39:41.280
 Although of course that's represented too, especially increasingly now with this generation

2:39:41.280 --> 2:39:45.280
 of going to university all over the world, you know, Stanford, MIT, everywhere.

2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:47.280
 Afghans are war reps into there.

2:39:47.280 --> 2:39:53.280
 But just being, I don't have any kind of worldly knowledge that is not limited to a province

2:39:53.280 --> 2:39:55.280
 to a village to a hamlet.

2:39:55.280 --> 2:40:02.280
 But it sometimes is, but sometimes it's not because of, again, not because of some fairytale

2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:10.280
 story of curiosity wanting to globe out of, you know, some sense of privilege, but out of

2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:12.280
 necessity out of survival of having to adapt.

2:40:12.280 --> 2:40:16.280
 And it's really extraordinary that, I mean, also let me think about like professions of

2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:22.280
 like, you know, as an Afghan, you know, what does he or she do for a living?

2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:24.280
 And what have they done in the past?

2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:31.280
 I mean, the answer is one gets shoe salesman, tax cop drivers, surgeons, all in one guy.

2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:32.280
 Yeah.

2:40:32.280 --> 2:40:36.280
 I mean, that's not just Afghan, but that's, you know, that's very common.

2:40:36.280 --> 2:40:38.280
 But it's also Russia is the same.

2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:39.280
 That's right.

2:40:39.280 --> 2:40:44.280
 Whenever there's complexities to the economic system and the short term and the long term

2:40:44.280 --> 2:40:46.280
 history of how the country develops.

2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:54.280
 And it's basically the people figuring out their way around a mess of a country politically,

2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:59.280
 but a beautiful, flourishing culture and humanity.

2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:02.280
 And that creates super interesting people.

2:41:02.280 --> 2:41:09.280
 So we can often see, okay, there's Taliban, there's war, there's economic malfunction,

2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:13.280
 there's harboring of terrorists, there's opium trade, all that kind of stuff.

2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:18.280
 There's humans there with deep intellectual lies.

2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:26.280
 And I love the movie Love Crimes and the same kind of hopes, fears and desire to love the

2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:28.280
 old Romeo and Juliet story.

2:41:28.280 --> 2:41:37.280
 And I think Rumi to me represents that the wit, the intelligence, but also the just eloquent

2:41:37.280 --> 2:41:41.280
 and just beautiful representation of humanity of love.

2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:48.280
 Some of the best quotes about love are from him, half of them fake, half of them real.

2:41:48.280 --> 2:41:49.280
 The best ones are real.

2:41:49.280 --> 2:41:50.280
 The best ones are real.

2:41:50.280 --> 2:41:51.280
 The best ones are real.

2:41:51.280 --> 2:41:54.280
 Robert, this is an incredible conversation.

2:41:54.280 --> 2:42:04.280
 Thank you for the tour of Afghanistan and making me, making us realize that there's much

2:42:04.280 --> 2:42:09.280
 more to this country than what we may think.

2:42:09.280 --> 2:42:13.280
 It's a beautiful country and it's full of beautiful people.

2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:15.280
 You made me think about a lot of new things too.

2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:17.280
 So it was definitely, definitely great for all mine too.

2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:19.280
 So thank you so much.

2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:21.280

 And now let me leave you with some words from Winston Churchill.

2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:35.280
 History will be kind to me for I intend to write it.

2:42:35.280 --> 2:42:39.280
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
