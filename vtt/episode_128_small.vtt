00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
 The following is a conversation with Michael Malis, an anarchist, political thinker, author,

00:05.760 --> 00:13.040
 and a proud, part time, Andy Kaufman like troll, in the best sense of that word, on both Twitter

00:13.040 --> 00:21.120
 and in real life. He's a host of a great podcast called You're Welcome, spelled Y O U R. I think

00:21.120 --> 00:27.120
 that gives a sense of his sense of humor. He is the author of Dear Reader, the unauthorized

00:27.120 --> 00:33.200
 autobiography of King Jong Il and The New Right, a journey to the fringe of American politics.

00:33.760 --> 00:39.360
 This latter book, when I read it or rather listened to it last year, helped me start

00:39.360 --> 00:44.640
 learning about the various disparate movements that I was undereducated about from the internet

00:44.640 --> 00:53.200
 trolls to Alex Jones to white nationalists and to techno anarchists. The book is funny and brilliant

00:53.200 --> 00:59.200
 and so is Michael. Unfortunately, because of a self imposed deadline, I actually pulled an all

00:59.200 --> 01:04.720
 nighter before this conversation. So I was not exactly all there mentally, even more so than

01:04.720 --> 01:11.040
 usual, which is tough because Michael is really quick witted and brilliant. But he was kind,

01:11.040 --> 01:16.800
 patient, and understanding in this conversation. And I hope you will be as well. Today, I'm trying

01:16.800 --> 01:22.720
 something a little new, looking to establish a regular structure for these intros of first,

01:22.720 --> 01:28.400
 doing the guest intro like I just did. Second, quick one or two sentence mention of each sponsor.

01:28.960 --> 01:35.600
 Third, my side comments related to the episode. And finally fourth, full ad reads on the audio

01:35.600 --> 01:40.720
 side of things. And on YouTube, going straight to the conversation. So not doing the full ad

01:40.720 --> 01:45.760
 reads. And as always, no ads in the middle because to me, they get in the way of the conversation.

01:46.560 --> 01:52.480
 So quick mention of the sponsors. First, SEM Rush, the most advanced SEO optimization

01:52.480 --> 01:57.760
 tool I've ever come across. I don't like looking at numbers, but someone probably should. It helps

01:57.760 --> 02:03.840
 you make good decisions. Second sponsor is DoorDash, food delivery service that I've used for many

02:03.840 --> 02:10.800
 years to fuel long uninterrupted sessions of deep work at Google MIT. And I still use it a lot today.

02:11.760 --> 02:17.280
 Third sponsor is Masterclass, online courses from the best people in the world on each of the

02:17.280 --> 02:24.400
 topics covered from rockets to game design to poker to writing and to guitar with Carlos Santana.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.920
 Please check out the sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.

02:30.560 --> 02:35.600
 As a side note, let me say that I hope to have some conversations with political thinkers,

02:35.600 --> 02:41.600
 including liberals and conservatives, anarchists, libertarians, objectivists, and everything in

02:41.600 --> 02:48.640
 between. I'm as allergic to Trump bashing and Trump worship as you probably are. I have none

02:48.640 --> 02:54.480
 of that in me. I really work hard to be open minded and let my curiosity drive the conversation.

02:54.480 --> 03:01.040
 I do plead with you to be patient on two counts. First, I have an intense, busy life outside of

03:01.040 --> 03:07.280
 these podcasts. Like it's 4am right now as I'm recording this. So sometimes life affects these

03:07.280 --> 03:12.400
 conversations. Like in this case, I pull an all nighter beforehand. So please be patient with me

03:12.400 --> 03:18.720
 if I say something ineliquent, confusing, dumb, or just plain wrong. I'll try to correct myself on

03:18.720 --> 03:24.160
 social media or in future conversations as much as I can. I really am always learning and working

03:24.160 --> 03:31.920
 hard to improve. Second, if I or the guest says something about, for example, our current president

03:31.920 --> 03:38.160
 Donald Trump that's over the top negative or over the top positive, please don't let your brain go

03:38.160 --> 03:44.160
 into partisan mode. Try to hear our words in an open minded, nuanced way. And if we say stuff from

03:44.160 --> 03:50.640
 a place of emotion, please give us a pass. Nuance conversation can only happen if we're patient with

03:50.640 --> 03:56.400
 each other. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review the five stars in Apple podcast,

04:03.360 --> 04:10.400
 my conversation with Michael Malis. There was a Simpsons episode where he starts mixing like sleeping

04:10.400 --> 04:14.560
 pills with like pet pills, and he's driving his truck. And I'm like, I want to see what happens

04:14.560 --> 04:22.320
 if he makes Red Bull a night truck called fruit. There's a lineup of drugs. This is going to be so

04:22.320 --> 04:30.880
 fun. This is good. Yeah. Let's start with love. Yeah. So one, one thing we'll eventually somehow

04:30.880 --> 04:36.560
 talk about, it'll be a theme throughout is that you're also Russian. Yes. A little bit less than me.

04:36.560 --> 04:43.280
 But how am I, because I'm from Ukraine? Oh, you're from Ukraine? Okay. Well, no, because you came here

04:43.280 --> 04:48.720
 a little bit when you were younger. Yeah. I came here when I was 13. So I saturated a little bit

04:48.720 --> 04:53.440
 of the Russian soul. I marinated in the Russian soul a little deeper. I haven't told anyone this,

04:53.440 --> 05:00.400
 but I'll be glad to tell you, Davidish. I haven't been back since I was two. And next summer, it

05:00.400 --> 05:04.240
 looks like me, my buddy Chris Williamson, who's also a podcaster, he's British modern wisdom,

05:04.240 --> 05:09.280
 he looks like Apollo. We're, we look like we got a videographer. Which Apollo? The God? He looks like

05:09.280 --> 05:17.280
 the God Apollo. Yeah, he's like a model. So we're going to go for the first time to see where I came

05:17.280 --> 05:22.160
 from. Which is in Ukraine. We're going to go to Levov and either St. Petersburg or Moscow,

05:22.160 --> 05:26.880
 probably St. Petersburg or both. It's going to be intense. It's going to be a lot of panic attacks,

05:26.880 --> 05:37.280
 I feel. And you're Russian is okay? You can't talk Russian and Ukraine or they get offended.

05:37.280 --> 05:44.320
 Yeah. But then you also want to go to Russia? Yeah. I don't know. For me, there's several people

05:44.320 --> 05:49.520
 in Russia. I want to interview on a podcast. Okay. So one of them is a good girl, a proman,

05:49.520 --> 05:55.440
 which is a mathematician. And the other person is Putin. You know, my favorite Putin story is,

05:55.440 --> 05:58.960
 do you know this? No. When he had Merkel with him, do you know this story? No.

05:58.960 --> 06:06.000
 Merkel's scared of dogs, like petrified of dogs. So he brings in his like, like, like a black lab.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.680
 It's a Labrador. It's like the sweetest animal. And it's all over her. And there's pictures and

06:09.680 --> 06:14.560
 she's sitting like this and she's terrified. And he's like, what's wrong, Angela? It's just completely

06:14.560 --> 06:22.080
 trolling her. Yeah. He's aware of the sort of the narrative around him. Yeah. And then he plays with

06:22.080 --> 06:26.720
 it. Yes. He enjoys it. It's a very Russian thing. My friend wanted to do a film about me. He goes,

06:26.720 --> 06:30.560
 I realized you guys aren't like us at all. You just like, like, look at us. And then I started

06:30.560 --> 06:34.240
 telling him stories about the upbringing. And he's like, Oh my God. And as I'm telling them,

06:34.240 --> 06:40.080
 I'm like, wow, this stuff is really crazy. Like what, how we are wired. Who's the, your friend is?

06:40.080 --> 06:43.760
 The Russian, the friend's American. I'm saying the way Russians are brought up and the way maybe,

06:43.760 --> 06:48.480
 I don't think it was just my family. I bet you had similar things. Like, here's an example. I was,

06:49.120 --> 06:52.160
 I had a buddy staying with me. He had a problem with his roommate. So he crashed into my place.

06:52.160 --> 06:59.120
 Fine. I went to the gym and I come back and he goes, Oh, there was, and my apartment building

06:59.120 --> 07:03.280
 is for four apartments. So it's not like a huge thing. He goes, Oh, there was someone knocking at

07:03.280 --> 07:09.520
 your door. So, you know, I told him, blah, blah. And, and for me, and I want to know if you're

07:09.520 --> 07:13.760
 the same way, if I'm at someone's house that's not my own and someone knocks on the door,

07:14.480 --> 07:19.520
 I wouldn't even think to answer it. Like if I had an apple here, maybe I'd eat it, I'd cut it,

07:19.520 --> 07:24.080
 whatever. I'm not going to, it just doesn't enter my head to smash into my face. But the thought of

07:24.080 --> 07:28.000
 answering the door, if it's not my house, it would never enter my head would enter your head.

07:28.560 --> 07:32.640
 No, but why? But he's an American. So someone's at the door. He goes and opens it, even though

07:32.640 --> 07:37.680
 it's not his house. I would never do that. I would never think to do that. That is so strange

07:37.680 --> 07:43.040
 that you pick some very obscure thing to delineate Americans. I don't think that's obscure because

07:43.040 --> 07:48.800
 I think it speaks to how we perceive strangers with Americans, everyone's friendly. And with us,

07:48.800 --> 07:54.400
 it's like, no, no, no, like you have that moat. And I think that's a that percolates into many

07:54.400 --> 07:58.640
 different aspects of how we relate to people. And I had to undo a lot of that. That's true.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.960
 You're right. There's the relationship I formed there where in Russia, we're very deep,

08:02.960 --> 08:08.800
 yes, close. And then there's the strangers, the other that you don't trust by default,

08:08.800 --> 08:13.760
 it takes a long time to go over the moat of trust. For a long time, until recently,

08:13.760 --> 08:19.760
 whenever I said anything to anyone, my brain ran a scan that said, if this person turns on you,

08:20.640 --> 08:24.640
 would this, can they use this against you? And I would do everything I said with strangers.

08:24.640 --> 08:28.480
 And after a while, it's like, you know what, maybe they will, but I'm strong enough to take it. But

08:28.480 --> 08:32.000
 this is not how Americans think. Well, here's another one. Let me ask you this. Sorry,

08:32.000 --> 08:36.400
 I'm taking over the interview. People asked about like advice for work, right? Like I had this,

08:36.400 --> 08:39.680
 there was this party I went to and basically everyone had their own problems and everyone

08:39.680 --> 08:43.760
 else gave their advice, right? And someone's having a problem with the coworker. And the advice

08:43.760 --> 08:49.680
 these DuPois Americans gave them is, oh, sit down and have a talk with them. And to me,

08:49.680 --> 08:54.560
 this is like the last case, last resort. Like first, you have to see what you can without

08:54.560 --> 08:58.720
 showing your hand, showing your vulnerability, only when everything hasn't worked out or you're

08:58.720 --> 09:02.480
 like, all right, let me sit down with you and try to have it out with you probably. But for them,

09:02.480 --> 09:06.800
 the first thing is like sit down and be like, oh, you're causing me problems and blah, blah, blah.

09:06.800 --> 09:11.440
 So I perceive that right away is a threat that this person sees an antagonism between us and

09:11.440 --> 09:17.280
 also as a weakness that I'm getting to them. So my reaction isn't, how do I make it better? My

09:17.280 --> 09:24.000
 reaction is to reinforce my position and see what I can to marginalize them. Usually. I haven't worked

09:24.000 --> 09:27.600
 in a corporate setting in a long time, but it's not, I don't approach it the way an American would

09:27.600 --> 09:30.640
 like, I'm glad you came and talked to me. Now I probably would because it's going to be a friend.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.600
 So you attribute that to the Russian I'm bringing as opposed to you have deep

09:36.320 --> 09:38.800
 psychological issues. I think there's a synonymous.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.080
 Would you think differently maybe a few years ago?

09:46.480 --> 09:51.360
 I don't know. I think you lost me at the, because you kind of said that

09:51.360 --> 09:57.120
 that you're kind of implying you have a deep distrust of the world. Like the world does.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.600
 I think the default setting would be distrust. Yeah.

10:00.960 --> 10:11.200
 But I would put it differently is I almost ignore the rest of the other one, even acknowledge it.

10:11.200 --> 10:18.480
 I just savor, I save my love and trust for the small circle of people.

10:18.480 --> 10:22.800
 I agree. But when that person is being confrontational or as they perceive it as being open,

10:23.920 --> 10:27.040
 now there's a situation. How do you, how would you handle that?

10:28.240 --> 10:32.720
 Like, like a cold wind blows. He's just kind of like, yeah, but it's not like this is an

10:32.720 --> 10:38.400
 opportunity for us to work out our differences. It's a cold wind. It's not a hug. That's my point.

10:38.400 --> 10:44.800
 Americans think it's a hug. You're so suspicious. What it really is is a cold wind.

10:44.800 --> 10:51.680
 I'm so inhumane. It's not something to be scared of. It's a cold wind. It's not in person.

10:52.560 --> 10:57.840
 But it's great. But it's not a source of like, I'm not suspicious of,

10:58.800 --> 11:03.840
 like I'm not anxious, I would say, or like living in fear of the rest of the world.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.800
 But you're, oh, I agree. But you're not receptive to that person.

11:06.800 --> 11:12.640
 Right. That's all I'm saying. And they are. Got it. So speaking of which, let's talk about love.

11:12.640 --> 11:18.960
 Yes. Which requires to be receptive of the world. Yes. Of strangers. I agree.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.320
 How do we put more love out there in the world, especially on the internet?

11:25.280 --> 11:32.160
 One mechanism I have found to prove increased love, and that's a word that has many meanings and is,

11:32.160 --> 11:35.200
 you know, used in a very intense sense and is used in a very loose sense.

11:35.200 --> 11:42.560
 Can you try to define love? Sure. Love is a strong sense of attraction toward

11:42.560 --> 11:52.640
 a another person, entity or place that causes one to tend to react in a disproportionately

11:52.640 --> 11:57.600
 positive manner. That's off the top of my head. Disproportionately. Yes. So for example, if you

11:57.600 --> 12:03.360
 Why not proportionately? Because like, if you're someone's about to who you love is about to get

12:03.360 --> 12:08.720
 harmed, you're moving heaven and earth to make sure or like a book you love, you know, like,

12:08.720 --> 12:12.320
 I love this book, like you're going through the fire to try to save it. Whereas if it's a book,

12:12.320 --> 12:17.360
 you really like, it's like, oh, I've got another one. I don't, you know, and a book's kind of a

12:17.360 --> 12:22.080
 loose example. But so you're going with the love that's like you're saving for just a few people,

12:22.080 --> 12:27.680
 almost like romantically, like love for a close family. But what about just love to even the

12:27.680 --> 12:33.760
 broader like the kind of love you can put out to people on the internet, which is like just kindness.

12:33.760 --> 12:40.480
 Sure. I would say in that case, it's important to make them feel seen and validated.

12:40.480 --> 12:45.200
 And I try to do this when people who I have come to know on the internet, and there's a lot,

12:45.200 --> 12:51.440
 I try to do that as much as possible, because I don't think it's valid how on social media,

12:51.440 --> 12:55.760
 and I do this a lot myself, but not towards everyone. It's just there to be aggressive

12:55.760 --> 13:00.960
 and antagonistic. You should be antagonistic towards bad people. And that's fine. But at

13:00.960 --> 13:05.600
 the same time, there's lots of great people. And especially with my audience, and I would

13:05.600 --> 13:10.640
 bet disproportionately with yours, there's a lots of people who are because of their

13:10.640 --> 13:15.840
 psychology and intelligence are going to be more and more isolated socially than they should.

13:16.480 --> 13:20.320
 And if I, and I've heard from many of them, and if I'm the person who makes them feel,

13:20.320 --> 13:26.320
 oh, I'm not crazy, it's everyone else around me who is just basic. The fact that I can be

13:26.320 --> 13:31.520
 that person, which I didn't have at their age to me is incredibly reaffirming.

13:31.520 --> 13:36.240
 You mean that source of love? But I mean, love in the sense of like, you know,

13:36.240 --> 13:39.920
 you care about this person and you want good things for them, not in a kind of romantic way.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.400
 But I mean, you're using it in a broad sense now. Yeah. But you're also a person who kind of,

13:46.000 --> 13:55.040
 I mean, attacks the power structures in the world by mocking them. Yes. Effectively. Yes. And

13:55.040 --> 14:05.760
 love, I would say, requires you to be non witty and simple and fragile, which I see it as like

14:05.760 --> 14:14.240
 the opposite of what trolls do. Trolls are, if I, if there is someone coming after what I love,

14:15.200 --> 14:21.520
 there's two mechanisms, right? At least two. I go up and I'm fighting them. And in which case,

14:21.520 --> 14:25.760
 you bring in, if you are getting hurt in a knife fight, even if you win the knife fight,

14:26.320 --> 14:32.240
 or if you disarm them and you preclude the possibility of a fight and you drive them off

14:32.240 --> 14:38.640
 or render them powerless, you can, you keep your person intact as yourself and you also protect

14:38.640 --> 14:43.680
 your values. So how do you render them powerless? As you just said, by mocking them, one of the

14:43.680 --> 14:48.800
 most effective mechanism for those in power, we're much closer to brave new world than 1984.

14:48.800 --> 14:53.600
 The people who are dominant and in power aren't there because of the threat of, you know, the

14:53.600 --> 14:59.120
 Gulag or prison. They're there because of social pressures. Look at the masks. I was on the subway

14:59.120 --> 15:04.400
 not that long ago in New York City. No one cared who I was until I put out the mask. I was in the

15:04.400 --> 15:07.600
 subway that long in New York City. They would, and I put this on my Instagram. I've told this story

15:07.600 --> 15:11.600
 before. There was an Asian dude in his early 30s. He was like in Western clothes. It's not like he

15:11.600 --> 15:17.680
 had a rickshaw or something. An older man in his 50s stood up over him on the subway, screamed at him,

15:17.680 --> 15:22.480
 said, go back where you came from. You're disgusting. I'm going to get sick. If you think

15:22.480 --> 15:25.680
 this guy is a vector of disease, which is your prerogative, why are you coming close to him?

15:25.680 --> 15:32.000
 Why are you getting in his face? And what was the rate? Sorry. So it was because he was Asian?

15:32.000 --> 15:38.880
 It was both. It was the not having a mask gave him the permission to act like a despicable,

15:38.880 --> 15:46.320
 aggressive person toward him, right? And the point being a lot of these mechanisms for social control

15:46.320 --> 15:51.920
 are outsourced to low quality people because this is their one chance to assert dominance and status

15:51.920 --> 15:57.200
 over somebody else. So the best way to diffuse that isn't with weaponry or fighting. It's through

15:57.200 --> 16:01.600
 mockery because all of a sudden their claims to authority are effectively destroyed.

16:01.600 --> 16:10.480
 So let me push back on that. What about fighting that with love, with patience and kindness towards

16:10.480 --> 16:15.920
 them? I don't think kindness is, I think that would be a mismatch and inappropriate.

16:15.920 --> 16:20.320
 Their Superman is Batman. Okay. And Superman's job is to help the good people and Batman's

16:20.320 --> 16:25.920
 job is to hurt the bad people. And I will always be on the Batman side than the Superman side.

16:27.120 --> 16:34.000
 Both work silly tight costumes. One has pointy ears. Both are ridiculous. So it's a billionaire

16:34.000 --> 16:40.560
 who gets, you know, he's swimming in trim. Which one is the bad man? Okay. I'm under educated

16:40.560 --> 16:48.160
 on the superhero movies. I apologize. Okay. But you're just saying you, your predisposition is

16:48.160 --> 16:56.320
 to be on the Batman side is to fighting the bad guys. Yeah. And it's what I'm good at.

16:57.120 --> 17:03.680
 That's what you're good at. But just to play devil's advocate, or actually, in this case,

17:03.680 --> 17:08.320
 I am the devil because it's what I usually do. Watch the devil. You're the angel's advocate.

17:08.320 --> 17:18.640
 Exactly. I'm to be the angel advocate. Yeah. It's like, I feel like mockery is a path towards

17:18.640 --> 17:27.600
 escalation of conflict. Yes. In many ways. Yes. So you're not, I mean, it's kind of like guerrilla

17:27.600 --> 17:33.200
 warfare. I mean, you're not going to win. I am winning. We're all winning. We're winning

17:33.200 --> 17:37.280
 on a daily. This is my next book. We're winning. We've won before. I'm not joking.

17:37.280 --> 17:41.120
 The topic of the next book. Yes, is the white pill. The white pill.

17:41.120 --> 17:46.800
 Is that we're going to, we are winning. The most horrible people are being rendered into laughing

17:46.800 --> 17:51.440
 stocks on a daily basis social media. This is a glorious thing. I just so disagree with you.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.040
 I disagree with you because there's side effects that are very destructive. It feels like you're

17:57.040 --> 18:04.560
 winning, but we're completely destroying the possibility of having like a cohesive society.

18:04.560 --> 18:10.800
 That's called oncology. What's that mean? Curing cancer. Your concept of a cohesive

18:10.800 --> 18:18.160
 society is in fact a society based on oppression and not allowing individuals to live their

18:18.160 --> 18:23.440
 personal freedom. Oh, so you're your utopian view of the world. You're the utopian. You're

18:23.440 --> 18:27.440
 saying cohesive society. I'm saying, I don't need that. I'm saying there's going to be conflict.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.200
 Right. There's going to be conflict. You and I are disagreeing right now. That's not cohesive.

18:31.200 --> 18:35.360
 Doesn't mean we like each other less. Doesn't mean we respect each other less. Cohesive doesn't,

18:35.360 --> 18:38.640
 it's just a euphemism for like everyone submitting to what I want.

18:39.920 --> 18:48.640
 No. I mean, cohesive could be that. It could be like enforced with violence, all that kind of

18:48.640 --> 18:57.760
 stuff, sort of the libertarian view of the world, but it could just be being respectful and kind of

18:57.760 --> 19:03.520
 each other and kind towards each other and loving towards each other. I mean, that's what I mean

19:03.520 --> 19:12.240
 by cohesive. So when people say free, it's funny. Like freedom is a funny thing because freedom could

19:12.240 --> 19:19.200
 be painful to a lot of people. It's all matters how you define it, how you implement it, how it

19:19.200 --> 19:29.840
 actually looks like. Sure. And I'm just saying it feels like the mockery of the powerful leads to

19:29.840 --> 19:36.720
 further and further the divisions. It's like the, it's turning life into a game to where

19:37.520 --> 19:44.720
 it's always you're creating these different little tribes and groups and you're constantly

19:44.720 --> 19:51.360
 fighting the groups that become a little bit more powerful by undercutting them through

19:51.360 --> 19:56.000
 guerrilla warfare kind of thing. And that's what the internet becomes is everyone's just mocking

19:56.000 --> 20:01.120
 each other and then certain groups become more and more powerful. And then they start fighting

20:01.120 --> 20:06.560
 each other into basically, they form groups of ideologies and they start fighting each other

20:06.560 --> 20:14.640
 in the internet. Where the result is, it doesn't feel like the common humanities highlighted. It

20:14.640 --> 20:22.320
 doesn't feel like that's a path of progress. Now, like when I say cohesive, I don't mean like

20:22.960 --> 20:28.000
 everybody has to be, you know, enforcing equality, all those kinds of ideas. I just mean like

20:28.960 --> 20:34.320
 not being so divisive. That's like, so it's going back to the original question of like,

20:34.320 --> 20:40.080
 how do we put more love out in the world than the internet? I want divisiveness. Oh, you see,

20:40.080 --> 20:44.720
 you think that this is, that's very interesting. It's the goal. So you started this conversation

20:44.720 --> 20:49.600
 where you're talking about you have love for that small group. I think we both would agree to have a

20:49.600 --> 20:55.840
 bigger group be better, especially if that love comes from a sincere place. I think our country

20:55.840 --> 20:59.600
 specifically, I wrote an article about this four years ago that it's time to disunite the states

20:59.600 --> 21:04.480
 and to secede. This country has been held together with at least two separate cultures, with dumb

21:04.480 --> 21:09.760
 tax and string for over 20 years. There's an enormous amount of contempt from one group toward

21:09.760 --> 21:14.720
 another. This contempt comes from a sincere place. They do not share each other's values.

21:14.720 --> 21:19.040
 There's absolutely no reason, just like any unhealthy relationship, where you can't say,

21:19.040 --> 21:25.280
 you know what, it's not working out. I want to go my own way and live my happiness and I genuinely

21:25.280 --> 21:29.680
 want you to go your way, live your happiness. If I'm wrong, prove you wrong. I'll learn from you

21:29.680 --> 21:34.160
 and take lessons and vice versa. But the fact that we all have to be in the same house together

21:34.720 --> 21:40.000
 is not coherent and that's not love. That is the path towards friction and tension and conflict.

21:40.880 --> 21:46.960
 Do you think there is concrete groups? Is it as simple as the two groups of blue and red?

21:46.960 --> 21:55.200
 No, it's also very fluid because you and I are allied as Jewish people, as Russians, as males,

21:55.200 --> 22:02.640
 as podcasters. You're an academic, I'm not. There's different, but we each are a Venn diagram,

22:02.640 --> 22:08.560
 even within ourselves. I can talk to you about politics and then we can talk about Russia stuff

22:08.560 --> 22:12.320
 and then you could talk about your work, which I don't know anything about, so that would be

22:12.320 --> 22:16.800
 where you're way up here and way down here. So there's lots, every relationship with just between

22:16.800 --> 22:22.480
 individuals, it's very dynamic. So how do we succeed? Like how do we form individual states

22:22.480 --> 22:28.640
 where there's a little bit more cohesion? Sure, and voluntary cohesion. So the first step

22:28.640 --> 22:38.080
 is to eliminate the concept of political authority as legitimate and to denigrate and humiliate those

22:38.080 --> 22:44.000
 who would put themselves in a position in which they are there to tell you how to live your life

22:44.000 --> 22:49.520
 from any semblance of validity. And that's starting to happen. If you look at what they had

22:49.520 --> 22:56.560
 with the lockdowns, Cuomo in De Blasio, New York, I was tired a couple weeks ago and I said to my

22:56.560 --> 22:59.840
 friend, oh, just click, maybe I have COVID. And he goes, it's not possible, like what do you mean?

23:00.480 --> 23:06.400
 And he goes, we haven't had any deaths in like two months and there's only like 100 cases a day

23:06.400 --> 23:11.360
 for like two months. And I go, you're exaggerating because everything was still closed. And I looked

23:11.360 --> 23:16.000
 at the numbers and he wasn't exaggerating. And there's no greater American dream to me

23:16.800 --> 23:21.040
 than an immigrant family comes to the States, forms their own little business,

23:21.600 --> 23:26.160
 maybe mom's a good cook is a restaurant, dry cleaner, fruit stand. And those people aren't

23:26.160 --> 23:31.440
 going to have a lot of money. Those are the first ones who lost their companies because of these

23:31.440 --> 23:37.520
 lockdowns. Cuomo, who's the governor of New York, opened up the gyms. He said, you're clear to open

23:37.520 --> 23:40.960
 up. De Blasio said, and we don't have enough inspectors, you're going to have to wait another

23:40.960 --> 23:47.200
 couple of weeks. To regard that as anything other than literally criminal is something that I

23:47.200 --> 23:50.160
 am having a hard and hard of time wrapping my head around.

23:51.280 --> 23:55.120
 You said, I mean, that's something I'm deeply worried about as well, which is like

23:55.120 --> 24:01.680
 thousands, it's actually millions of dreams being crushed that American American dream of starting

24:01.680 --> 24:07.600
 a business of running a business. What about all the young people who you and I have in our audiences

24:07.600 --> 24:11.200
 who are socially isolated at best, and now they can't leave their homes?

24:12.720 --> 24:18.480
 Isolation and ostracism are things that are very well studied in psychology. These have extreme

24:18.480 --> 24:23.200
 consequences. I read a book called ostracism. And this wasn't scientific, but basically the

24:23.200 --> 24:27.040
 author was a psychiatrist or a college whatever. And he had one of his colleagues, they didn't

24:27.040 --> 24:31.920
 experiment. Let's for a week, you ostracize me completely. We know it's an, and he goes,

24:31.920 --> 24:35.760
 even knowing it's the experiment, the fact that he wouldn't make eye contact with me and the fact

24:35.760 --> 24:42.720
 that he ignored me had an extreme emotional impact on me. Knowing full well, this is purely for

24:42.720 --> 24:47.040
 experimental purposes. Now you multiply that by all these, the suicide, the number of kids who

24:47.040 --> 24:53.360
 think about suicide was through the roof during all this. And my point is until these people, it's

24:53.360 --> 24:57.680
 going to have a pretty quick 2024, that's where we're going to have to start having conversations

24:57.680 --> 25:01.680
 about what personal consequences have to be done for these people, because until then they're going

25:01.680 --> 25:06.640
 to do the same thing. So you think there's going to be society wide consequences of this that we're

25:06.640 --> 25:12.000
 going to see like ripple effects because of the social isolation? I know, I mean, we also need

25:12.000 --> 25:17.680
 to talk about consequences of Cuomo and de Blasio. Because if politicians respond to incentives and

25:17.680 --> 25:21.760
 the incentives are there for them to be extremely conservative. Because if you have to choose,

25:21.760 --> 25:25.680
 as Cuomo said in a press conference, between a thousand people dying and a thousand people

25:25.680 --> 25:29.840
 losing their business, it's not a hard choice. And he's right. But at a certain point, it's like,

25:29.840 --> 25:35.520
 all right, you're losing both, you're losing, not losing, you're making these decisions and not

25:35.520 --> 25:39.440
 having consequences for it. And you're going to do it again the next time. So we need to make

25:39.440 --> 25:44.800
 sure you're a little scared. Okay. And I don't know what that would mean. But you're laying

25:45.680 --> 25:50.640
 this problem, this, this incompetence. I don't think it's incompetence. I think it's very

25:50.640 --> 25:58.000
 competent. I think they're just their job. Yes. But what, but you're laying it not at the hands

25:58.000 --> 26:04.640
 of the individuals, but the structure of the of government. It's both. Yes. How would we deal with

26:04.640 --> 26:09.440
 it better without centralized control? Well, we didn't really have centralized control because

26:09.440 --> 26:14.080
 every country and every state handled it in a different mechanism. But a city has centralized

26:14.080 --> 26:18.640
 control. Just, yeah, right. No, that's not true. So Cuomo and De Blasio, they had a lot of

26:18.640 --> 26:22.640
 disagreements over this over the months. And this was actually a source of great interest and tension.

26:23.360 --> 26:28.240
 De Blasio wanted, at one point was talking about quarantining people in their homes. Cuomo was

26:28.240 --> 26:33.440
 like, you're crazy. Same thing with the schools, same thing with the gyms. And there were other

26:33.440 --> 26:39.920
 such examples. But the point being, this was an emergency. This is World War One. I talked about

26:39.920 --> 26:46.000
 this on Tim Pool's show. It was very dangerous because it gave a lot of evil people some very

26:46.000 --> 26:50.400
 useful information about what the country put up with and what they can get away with under

26:50.400 --> 26:55.040
 wartime. And this set the model for things like the New Deal and the other things of that nature.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.560
 It is undeniable, you're a scientist, so you understand this perfectly well,

26:58.560 --> 27:07.520
 that this lockdown gave some very nefarious people some very valid data about how much people would

27:07.520 --> 27:15.280
 put up with under pressures from the state. So fundamentally, what is the problem with the

27:15.280 --> 27:25.520
 state that existence? Okay, well, but to play Angel's advocate again, you know, government

27:25.520 --> 27:33.600
 is the people. Come on. Do you really think this? As best I think it's possible to have

27:34.240 --> 27:37.680
 representation. Can you imagine if you have an attorney, you're like, oh, you can't have

27:37.680 --> 27:40.560
 the attorney you want. You're gonna have this guy who you absolutely hate, who you share no

27:40.560 --> 27:46.400
 values with. Why? Because he drives, I mean, leaders, political leaders, and political

27:46.400 --> 27:52.160
 representation drive the discourse. Like we, you know, the majority of people voted for him or

27:52.160 --> 27:58.640
 whatever, however, however you define that. And now we get to have a discussion. Well,

27:59.760 --> 28:04.000
 was this the right choice? And then we get to make that choice again in four years and so on.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.960
 First of all, the fact that I have to be under the thumb of somebody for years makes no sense.

28:08.960 --> 28:13.120
 There's no other relationship that's like this, including a marriage. You can leave any other

28:13.120 --> 28:18.400
 relationship at any time. Number one, number two is it always impeach what they did that part of

28:18.400 --> 28:26.400
 it. I'm just saying that the mechanisms are flawed in many ways. Yeah. Right. And so that's

28:26.400 --> 28:32.720
 number one. Number two is it doesn't make sense that if I don't want someone to represent me,

28:32.720 --> 28:38.960
 that because that person is popular, that they are now in a position to. So having representation

28:38.960 --> 28:45.680
 and having citizenship based on geography is a prelandline technology in a post cell phone world.

28:45.680 --> 28:50.560
 There's no reason why I have to just because we're physically in between two oceans,

28:50.560 --> 28:54.800
 we all have to be represented by the same people. Whereas I can very easily have my

28:54.800 --> 28:58.640
 security be under someone and switch it as easily as cell phone providers.

28:58.640 --> 29:02.880
 So okay, but it doesn't have to be geographical. It can be ideas. Sure. I mean,

29:02.880 --> 29:07.520
 this country represents a certain set of ideas. Yes, it does. It started out geographically.

29:07.520 --> 29:11.520
 It still is geographic. It started off as ideas as well. But like there's it's it was

29:11.520 --> 29:17.120
 intricately. I mean, that's the way humans are. There's I mean, there was no internet.

29:17.120 --> 29:21.440
 So it was your geographically the same location and you sign a bunch of documents and then you

29:21.440 --> 29:26.640
 kind of debated and you wrote a bunch of stuff and then you agreed on it. Okay.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.480
 You understand that no one signed these documents and no one agreed to it,

29:30.480 --> 29:35.920
 as Lysander Spooner pointed out over 150 years ago. The constitution or the social contract,

29:35.920 --> 29:40.640
 if anything, is only binding to the signatories. And even then they're all long dead.

29:40.640 --> 29:46.880
 So it's this fallacy that somehow because I'm in a physical place, I have agreed,

29:46.880 --> 29:50.960
 even though I'm screaming through a face that I don't agree to be subordinate to

29:51.840 --> 29:57.280
 some imaginary invisible monster that was created 250 years ago. And this idea of like,

29:57.280 --> 30:00.880
 if you don't like it, you have to move. That's not what freedom means. Freedom means I do what I

30:00.880 --> 30:06.640
 want, not what you want. So if you don't like it, you move. Okay, just to put some, I don't like

30:06.640 --> 30:11.520
 words and terms. 1110, 1110. Yeah, exactly. Because that's what your language is.

30:11.520 --> 30:18.800
 It is. I'm translating it all in real time. But would you call the kind of ideas that

30:18.800 --> 30:22.400
 you're advocating for and we're talking about anarchy? Yes, anarchism, yes.

30:23.200 --> 30:33.520
 Okay, so let's get into it. Can you try to paint the utopia that an anarchist worldview dreams about?

30:33.520 --> 30:38.720
 The only people who describe anarchism as utopia are its critics. If I told you right now,

30:39.520 --> 30:43.520
 and I wish I could say this factually, that I have a cure for cancer that would not make us

30:43.520 --> 30:49.600
 utopia, that would still probably be expensive. We would still have many other diseases. However,

30:49.600 --> 30:54.880
 we would be fundamentally healthier, happier and better off all of us.

30:54.880 --> 30:58.560
 Then democracy. So I jumped back from the cancer.

30:58.560 --> 31:05.360
 No, then democracy or government. So it's only curing one major, major life threatening problem.

31:05.360 --> 31:13.120
 But in no sense is it a utopia. So what can we try to answer this question? Same question many

31:13.120 --> 31:19.120
 times, which is what exactly is the problem with democracy? The problem with democracy is that those

31:19.120 --> 31:25.600
 who need leaders are not qualified to choose them. Those who need leaders are not qualified

31:25.600 --> 31:31.920
 to choose them. That's the central problem with democracy. Not all of us need leaders.

31:36.960 --> 31:40.640
 What does it mean to need a leader? Are you saying like people who are actually

31:41.520 --> 31:46.800
 free thinkers don't need leaders kind of thing? Sure. That's a good way of working.

31:46.800 --> 31:56.640
 Okay, so do you acknowledge that there's some value in authority in different subjects? So what

31:56.640 --> 32:01.360
 that means is I don't mean authority, somebody who's in control of you. But you're doing the

32:01.360 --> 32:07.680
 definition switch. Yeah, I am. You're right. It's unfair. Okay, that was bad.

32:08.240 --> 32:12.480
 But that's what they do. That's their trick. And this is one of the useful things, by the way,

32:12.480 --> 32:16.080
 Lesley has told us sidebar. If people ask me for advice, I always tell them,

32:16.080 --> 32:20.160
 if you're going to raise your kids, raise them bilingual. Because I was trilingual by the time

32:20.160 --> 32:24.640
 I was six, and that teaches you to think in concepts. Whereas if you only know one language,

32:24.640 --> 32:28.480
 you fall for things like this, because using authority in the sense of a policeman,

32:28.480 --> 32:33.360
 and someone's authority in physics, it's the same word. Conceptually, they're extremely different.

32:33.360 --> 32:37.920
 But if you're only thinking in one language, your brain is going to equate the two. And that's

32:37.920 --> 32:42.240
 a trap that people who only speak one language have. For sure. But even if you know multiple

32:42.240 --> 32:47.280
 languages, you can still use the trick of using your words to your convenience to manipulate

32:47.280 --> 32:51.600
 the conversation. You weren't trying to do that, but you fell into that. I accidentally did it.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.880
 We all tend to do that if you only speak one language and think in one language.

32:54.880 --> 33:04.080
 But if, I guess let me rephrase it, are you against, do you acknowledge the value of offloading

33:04.880 --> 33:10.960
 your own effort about a particular thing to somebody else? Absolutely. Like an accountant,

33:10.960 --> 33:18.480
 a lawyer, a doctor, absolute, a chef, infinite. Isn't that ultimately what a democracy is?

33:18.480 --> 33:22.800
 No. Broadly defined. Like you're basically electing a bunch of authorities.

33:22.800 --> 33:27.280
 Using the word you in two senses. Using the word you, meaning me as an individual, not using you

33:27.280 --> 33:33.760
 as a mass. Yeah, as a mass, not you as an individual. Right. So I would absolutely want

33:33.760 --> 33:38.000
 someone to provide for my security. I would absolutely want someone to negotiate with me

33:38.000 --> 33:42.320
 for foreign powers or something like that. That does not mean it has to be predicated

33:42.320 --> 33:46.400
 and what lots of other people who I do not know, and if I do know them, probably would not respect,

33:47.200 --> 33:52.720
 think about. It's of no moral relevance to me. Nor are I to them.

33:52.720 --> 33:58.800
 Do you think this kind of, there could be a bunch of humans that behave kind of like ants

33:59.600 --> 34:06.880
 in a distributed way. There could be an emergent behavior in them that results in a stable society.

34:06.880 --> 34:11.840
 Like it's not the hope with anarchies, like without an overarching.

34:13.120 --> 34:17.600
 But ants, I mean, ants are the worst example here because ants have a very firm authority.

34:17.600 --> 34:21.520
 The queen. Yeah. And they're all, they're all drones. They're all clones of each other.

34:22.320 --> 34:28.880
 Yeah, but so if you forget the queen, their behavior, they're all, well, from your perspective,

34:28.880 --> 34:32.320
 from your human intelligence perspective, but from their perspective, I probably see

34:32.320 --> 34:37.040
 each other as a bunch of individuals. No, they don't. Ants are very big on altruism in the sense

34:37.040 --> 34:44.880
 of self sacrifice. They do not think the individual matters. They routinely kill themselves for the

34:44.880 --> 34:49.600
 sake of the hive in the community. But they, see, that's from the outside perspective, from

34:49.600 --> 34:56.960
 the individual perspective of the individual, they probably, they, they don't see it as altruism.

34:56.960 --> 35:02.080
 Right. But they, they, they view, and they're right because the ants life is very ephemeral and

35:02.080 --> 35:08.080
 cheap, that it's more important to continue this mass population that, that one individual ant

35:08.080 --> 35:12.640
 live. Like bees are another, even better example, the honeybee, when they sting, they only sting

35:12.640 --> 35:17.120
 once and they die. And they do it gladly because it's like, okay, this community is much more

35:17.120 --> 35:23.280
 important than me. And they're right. Yeah. Okay. So fine. Let's forget. I'm being pedantic,

35:23.280 --> 35:26.800
 but it's important, I think. I'm not just being pedantic for the sake of being pedantic. But there's

35:26.800 --> 35:31.840
 something beautiful that I won't argue about because I do, there's an interesting point there

35:31.840 --> 35:37.920
 about individualism of ants. I do think they're more individual. But let's, let's give your view

35:37.920 --> 35:42.640
 of ants that they're, it's, they're communists. Okay. Let's go with the communist view of ants.

35:42.640 --> 35:50.240
 Okay. Yeah. But there's still a beautiful emergent thing, which is like, they can function as a,

35:50.240 --> 35:59.360
 as a society and without, I would say, centralized control. It's another argument.

35:59.360 --> 36:03.920
 So is that the hope for anarchy? It's like, you just throw a bunch of people that voluntarily

36:03.920 --> 36:10.240
 want to be in the same place under the same set of ideas. And they kind of, like the doctors emerge,

36:10.240 --> 36:16.320
 the police officers emerge, the, the different necessary structures of a functional society

36:16.320 --> 36:21.920
 emerge. Do you know what the most beautiful example of anarchism is that is just beyond

36:21.920 --> 36:25.040
 beautiful when you stop to think about it? I'll say Twitter. I'm not, I'm not being tongue in

36:25.040 --> 36:33.040
 cheek. Okay. Language. There's infinite languages, language, the things that language can be used for

36:33.040 --> 36:39.760
 are, bring tears to people's eyes quite literally. It's also used for basic things. No one is forcing

36:39.760 --> 36:45.360
 us, we speak two languages each, at least no one's forcing us to use English. No one's forcing us to

36:45.360 --> 36:51.840
 use this dialect of English. It's a way and, and despite there being so many different languages,

36:52.720 --> 36:57.040
 lingua franca emerge, you know, people, the language of everyone is Latin. Even in North

36:57.040 --> 37:03.520
 Korea, they refer to the fish and the different animals by the Latin scientific, no one decided

37:03.520 --> 37:08.080
 that, sure, there's an organization that sets a binomial nomenclature, but there's no gun to

37:08.080 --> 37:15.280
 anyone's head referring to Seamoth as a Pegasus species. And when you think about how amazing

37:15.280 --> 37:20.320
 language is, and some in other contexts would say like, well, you, you need to have a world

37:20.320 --> 37:24.960
 government and they're deciding which is the verbs and you have to have an official definition

37:24.960 --> 37:30.240
 and an official dictionary. And none of that's happened. And I think anyone, even if they don't

37:30.240 --> 37:36.400
 agree with my politics or my worldview, cannot deny that the creation of language is one of

37:36.400 --> 37:42.800
 humanity's most miraculous, beautiful achievements. Absolutely. So there, there you go. There's one

37:42.800 --> 37:50.800
 system where a kind of anarchy can result in, in beauty, stability, like sufficient stability,

37:50.800 --> 37:57.920
 and yet dynamic flexibility to adjust to them and so on. And the internet helps it. You get

37:57.920 --> 38:03.200
 something, something like urban dictionary, which starts creating absurd, both humor and

38:03.200 --> 38:10.000
 wit. But also language and syntax and jargon, immediately you size people up. If you use,

38:10.000 --> 38:13.920
 if you say vertebral, I know you're a doctor, because that's how they pronounce it, the spinal

38:13.920 --> 38:18.240
 column. I'm sure in your field, there's certain jargon right away. You can know if this person's

38:18.240 --> 38:22.240
 one of us or not. I mean, it's infinite. I mean, I don't need to tell you anyone.

38:22.240 --> 38:26.240
 It's emojis too. Yes. There's so much there to study with language. It's fascinating.

38:26.240 --> 38:33.760
 But do you think this applies to human life, the meat space, the physical space? Yes. So these,

38:33.760 --> 38:39.840
 there's that kind of beauty can emerge without, without writing stuff on paper, without laws.

38:39.840 --> 38:45.760
 You could have rules. You don't need, you don't have to be laws. So enforced by violence. Like

38:45.760 --> 38:51.600
 that's what, what's a law? A law is something that is unchosen. A rule is something, if I go to my

38:51.600 --> 38:57.360
 pool, I sign up to your member pool on the wall, there's certain things. It's like, you know,

38:57.360 --> 39:02.400
 certain number of people in the pool, no peeing in here. Good luck enforcing that one. And so on

39:02.400 --> 39:05.920
 and so forth. Well, that's the problem. Aren't you afraid that people are going to pee in the pool?

39:06.880 --> 39:12.240
 That's not as my biggest concern is mass incarceration, as the fact that the police

39:12.240 --> 39:16.800
 can steal more money than burglars can. The fact that innocent people can be killed with no

39:16.800 --> 39:24.480
 consequences. The fact that war can be waged and with no consequences for those who waged it.

39:24.480 --> 39:28.240
 The fact that so many men and women are being murdered overseas and here,

39:28.240 --> 39:30.960
 and the people who are guiding these are regarded as heroic.

39:30.960 --> 39:37.920
 So you think there might, that in an anarchist system, there's a possibility of having less

39:37.920 --> 39:44.560
 wars and less, what would you say, corruption and less abuse of power?

39:44.560 --> 39:48.880
 Let's talk, yes, and let's talk about corruption because, and I made this point on

39:48.880 --> 39:54.560
 Rogan, you and I, again, this is the Russian background, we realize that when it comes to

39:54.560 --> 39:58.880
 corruption, American is very naive. Corruption, they think is, oh, I got my brother a job and

39:58.880 --> 40:04.080
 he's getting money on the table. That's not, when we're talking about like state corruption,

40:04.080 --> 40:07.680
 things that are done in totalitarian states, and even to some extent America, like Jeffrey

40:07.680 --> 40:12.080
 Epstein, Gillian Maxwell, things that Stalin did, things that Hitler did. You know, when the CIA

40:12.080 --> 40:16.640
 was torturing people at Gitmo, they had to borrow KGB manuals because they didn't know

40:16.640 --> 40:21.440
 how to torture correctly because they never thought of these things. We, it's very hard for us to

40:22.000 --> 40:27.280
 get into the mindset of someone who's like a child predator, someone who, let me give you

40:27.280 --> 40:31.760
 an example from my forthcoming book, there was a guy who was the head of Ukraine in the 30s,

40:31.760 --> 40:36.160
 I forget his name. Now these old Soviets, they were tough. I mean, they pride, Stalin means

40:36.160 --> 40:43.040
 steel. You know, they pride themselves and their cruelty and how strong they were. And this was the purge. You know, Stalin is trying to, you know,

40:43.040 --> 40:48.960
 killing lots of people left and right. And his henchmen, Beria, had the quote, find me the man,

40:48.960 --> 40:52.720
 I'll find you the crime. You know, they would accuse someone and they would torture him

40:52.720 --> 40:57.920
 until he talked and confessed. And then he had to turn people in. And they took this guy in,

40:57.920 --> 41:02.720
 like beginning the year, I think it's 36, 38, he was head of Ukraine. By May, he's arrested.

41:02.720 --> 41:06.480
 And they take him to the Ljublanka, the basement in the Red Square where they're torturing people.

41:06.480 --> 41:10.000
 And they put, they did the works on him. And he was a good Soviet and he stood up.

41:11.040 --> 41:16.160
 Who knows what they did to him? He didn't talk. So they said, okay, one moment,

41:16.160 --> 41:22.240
 they brought his teenage daughter in, raped her in front of him. He talked. So when we talk about

41:22.240 --> 41:28.080
 corruption, we would never in a million years think of this. That's not how our minds work.

41:28.080 --> 41:33.360
 So when you're talking about states and people where you don't have

41:33.920 --> 41:40.960
 ease of exit, where you are forced to be under the auspices of an organization creating a monopoly,

41:41.520 --> 41:49.040
 that leads to, in extreme cases, but in not as extreme cases, really nefarious outcomes.

41:49.040 --> 41:56.320
 Whereas if you have the option to leave as a client or customer, that would have a strongly

41:56.320 --> 42:00.640
 limiting effect on how a business and what it can get away with.

42:01.360 --> 42:05.600
 But don't you think maybe, I don't know who the right example is, whether it's Stalin,

42:05.600 --> 42:12.560
 I think Hitler might be the better example of, don't you think, or Jeffrey Epstein perhaps,

42:12.560 --> 42:22.320
 don't you think people who are evil will find ways to manipulate human nature to attain power,

42:22.320 --> 42:28.640
 no matter the system? Yes. And like the corollary question is, do you think those

42:29.200 --> 42:37.360
 people can get more power in the democracy, when there's a government already in place?

42:37.360 --> 42:41.120
 It's easily, they get more power, more dangerous to have a government in place. First of all,

42:41.120 --> 42:45.760
 sociopaths don't know for their charm and for their warmth. Here's the two situations.

42:45.760 --> 42:51.760
 In a free society, I'm a sociopath, I'm an evil person, I'm the head of Macy's.

42:52.880 --> 42:56.640
 In a state society, I'm an evil person, I'm a sociopath, I'm the head of the US government.

42:57.200 --> 43:01.520
 Which of these are you more concerned with? It's like night and day. So you would have far more

43:01.520 --> 43:08.800
 decentralized military, you would have far more decentralized security forces, and they would

43:08.800 --> 43:15.200
 be much more subject to feedback from the market. If you have an issue with Macy's or any store with

43:15.200 --> 43:21.760
 a sweater, look at that transaction. If you have an issue with the state, hiring a lawyer costs

43:21.760 --> 43:27.120
 more than a surgeon. To even access the mechanism for dispute is going to be exorbitant and price

43:27.120 --> 43:32.080
 poor people at the market for conflict resolution immediately. So right away, you have something

43:32.080 --> 43:37.600
 that's extremely regressive. And even though this is touted as some great equalizer, it's

43:37.600 --> 43:42.400
 quite the opposite. So in current society, there's deep suspicion of governments and states.

43:42.400 --> 43:50.320
 Well, just your example of Macy's, I mean, don't you think a Hitler could rise to be at the top

43:50.320 --> 43:55.200
 of social network like Twitter and Facebook? Okay, let's suppose Hitler ran Twitter. Okay,

43:56.160 --> 44:00.480
 let's take this thought experiment seriously. Literally, what could he do? So all the only

44:00.480 --> 44:05.360
 tweets are going to be about how much the Jews suck, right? Okay, fine. Okay, all the cool people

44:05.360 --> 44:13.120
 are leaving. There could be some compelling, like you said, evil people are charming. There could

44:13.120 --> 44:20.240
 be some compelling narratives that could be we've conspiracy theories, untruths, that could be spread

44:20.240 --> 44:26.160
 like propaganda. Every criticism of anarchism is in fact a description of all the strongest

44:26.160 --> 44:31.920
 criticism of anarchism are in fact description of the status quo. Your concern is under anarchism,

44:31.920 --> 44:36.880
 propaganda would spread and people would be taught the wrong ideas, unlike the status quo.

44:37.520 --> 44:43.200
 That's not even a criticism of anarchism. I'm not actually criticizing. It's an open question of,

44:45.520 --> 44:54.160
 it's an open question of in which system will human nature thrive, be able to thrive more?

44:54.160 --> 45:01.360
 And in which system would the evils that arise in human nature would be more easily suppressible?

45:01.360 --> 45:07.120
 That's the open question. It's a scientific experiment, and I'm asking only from my perspective

45:07.120 --> 45:13.920
 of the fact that we've tried democracy quite a bit recently, and I don't, maybe you can correct

45:13.920 --> 45:19.520
 me, we haven't yet seriously tried anarchy in a large scale. Well, we don't need to try to,

45:19.520 --> 45:25.040
 so anarchy isn't like a country, right? It's like, it's like saying, well, if anarchy works,

45:25.040 --> 45:29.920
 how come we've never had an anarchist government, right? So anarchism is a relationship and language

45:29.920 --> 45:33.760
 is an example of this. It's a worldwide anarchic system. You and I have an anarchist relationship.

45:33.760 --> 45:36.960
 There's almost no circumstances we'd be calling the police on each other.

45:37.520 --> 45:42.240
 I mean, it's, I'm asking the same question in a bunch of different directions out of,

45:42.240 --> 45:50.720
 born out of my curiosity, is why is anarchy going to be better at preventing the darker

45:50.720 --> 45:54.480
 sides of human nature, which presumably your criticism of government.

45:54.480 --> 45:59.040
 Oh, because it's because of decentralization. So the darker side of human nature is an extreme

45:59.040 --> 46:05.040
 concern. Anyone who says it's going to go away is absurd and fallacious. I think that's a nonstarter

46:05.040 --> 46:08.960
 when people say that everyone's going to be good. Human beings are basically animals. We're capable

46:08.960 --> 46:15.120
 of great beauty and kindness. We're capable of just complete, cruel, and what we would call inhumanity,

46:15.120 --> 46:21.600
 but we see it on a daily basis even today. And what's interesting is the corporate press won't

46:21.600 --> 46:26.080
 even tell you the darkest aspects because that's too upsetting to people. So they'll tell you about

46:26.080 --> 46:30.800
 atrocities and horrors, but only to a point. And then when you actually do the homework,

46:30.800 --> 46:35.120
 you're like, oh, it's so much worse than, like that thing about Stalin, right? So we know in a

46:35.120 --> 46:42.320
 broad sense that Stalin was a dictator. We know that he killed a lot of people, but it takes work

46:42.320 --> 46:47.440
 to learn about the Holodomor. It takes work to learn about what those literal tortures were,

46:47.440 --> 46:52.080
 and that this is the person who later, FDR and Harry Truman were shaking hands with

46:52.080 --> 46:56.320
 and taking photos with and was being sold to us as Uncle Joe. He's just like you and me.

46:57.760 --> 47:05.840
 So when you have a decentralized information network, as opposed to having three media networks,

47:05.840 --> 47:11.440
 it is a lot easier for information that doesn't fit what would be the corporate American narrative

47:11.440 --> 47:16.160
 to reach the populations. And it would be more effective for democracy,

47:16.160 --> 47:21.040
 because they're in a much better position to be informed. Now, you're right. It also means,

47:21.040 --> 47:25.360
 well, if everyone has a mic, that means every crazy person, and with their wacky views.

47:25.360 --> 47:30.080
 And at a certain point, yeah, it has to become, then there's another level, which is then the

47:30.080 --> 47:34.240
 people have to be self enforcing. And you see that in social media all the time when someone

47:34.240 --> 47:39.760
 says this, the other person jumps in. You think, but isn't social media a good example of this?

47:40.480 --> 47:47.440
 So you think ultimately, without centralized control, you can have stability? Like,

47:47.440 --> 47:54.480
 what about the mob outrage and the mob rule, the power of the mobs that emerge?

47:54.480 --> 48:00.880
 The power of the mob is very serious concern. Gustav Le Bon wrote a book in the 1890s called

48:00.880 --> 48:04.240
 The Crowd. And this was one of the most important books I've written, because it influenced both

48:04.240 --> 48:09.520
 Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin, and they all talked about it. And he made the point that under

48:09.520 --> 48:14.800
 crowd psychology, human lynching is another example of this. None of those individuals,

48:14.800 --> 48:21.920
 or very few would ever dream of doing these acts. But when they're all together, and you lose that

48:21.920 --> 48:26.400
 sense of self, you become the ant, and you lose that sense of individually, you're capable of

48:26.400 --> 48:31.440
 doing things that like in another context, you'd be like, I should kill myself. I'm a monster.

48:32.160 --> 48:36.720
 So you're worried about that, but like, isn't the mob, doesn't the mob have more power under

48:36.720 --> 48:41.840
 anarchy? No, the mob has much less power and anarchy because under anarchism, every individual

48:41.840 --> 48:49.360
 is fully empowered. You wouldn't have gun restrictions. You would have people creating

48:49.360 --> 48:54.880
 communities based on shared values. They'd be much more collegial. They'd be much more kind,

48:54.880 --> 49:00.400
 as opposed to when you're forcing people to be together in a polity, when they don't have things

49:00.400 --> 49:06.880
 in common, that is like having a bad roommate. If you're forced to liquid jails, if you're forced

49:06.880 --> 49:12.320
 to be in locked in a room with someone, even if you at first like them, after a while you're

49:12.320 --> 49:18.080
 going to start to hate them, and that leads to very nefarious consequences. So as an anarchist,

49:18.080 --> 49:23.440
 what are you doing in a society like this? Thrive. I think I'm doing okay.

49:23.440 --> 49:37.440
 I mean, there's an election coming up. As you talk, you're welcome is one of the

49:38.000 --> 49:46.960
 15 shows that you host. It's down to one. Okay, it's down to one. But I'm a big fan.

49:46.960 --> 49:54.400
 You talk about libertarianism a little bit. I mean, is there some practical

49:56.560 --> 50:03.120
 political direction in terms of we as a society should go? I don't mean we as a nation. I mean,

50:03.120 --> 50:09.120
 we as a collective of people should go to make a better world from an anarchist point of view.

50:09.120 --> 50:14.400
 Sure. I think politics is the enemy. I need to find politics.

50:14.400 --> 50:20.880
 The state, the government. So anything that lessens its sway on people, anything that

50:20.880 --> 50:27.120
 delegitimizes it is good. I read an article a few years ago about how wonderful it is that

50:27.120 --> 50:33.360
 Trump is regarded as such a buffoon because it's very, very useful to have a commander in chief

50:33.360 --> 50:38.960
 who's regarded as a clown because it's going to take a lot to get him to convince your kids to

50:38.960 --> 50:43.200
 go overseas and start killing people and making widows and orphans, as well as those kids coming

50:43.200 --> 50:48.320
 home in caskets. Whereas if someone is regarded with prestige and they're like, oh, we need to send

50:48.320 --> 50:54.240
 your kid overseas. Oh, absolutely. I mean, this guy's great. So that is a very healthy thing

50:54.240 --> 51:01.040
 where people are skeptical of the state. But there's a lot of people that regard him as

51:02.480 --> 51:06.880
 one of the greatest leaders we've ever had. Yeah. Dinesh D'Souza. He's another Lincoln.

51:06.880 --> 51:16.400
 I, when you talk shit about Trump or talk shit about Biden, I think I'm trying to find a line to

51:16.400 --> 51:21.680
 walk where they don't immediately put you into the, this person has Trump derangement syndrome or

51:22.240 --> 51:28.240
 they have the other, the alternative to that. I'm more than happy when people are preemptively

51:28.240 --> 51:32.000
 dismissing me because they don't have to waste time engaging with them because those people

51:32.000 --> 51:37.200
 we have no use to me. When I was on Tim Poole recently, Tim Poole show, Tim Poole is known for

51:37.200 --> 51:41.680
 his little like hat. I got a propeller beanie motorized and it was just spinning the whole

51:41.680 --> 51:47.920
 two hours, 1950s thing. The point being, I wore it because there's lots of people who would say,

51:48.480 --> 51:52.880
 I can't take seriously someone who wears a hat like that. And my point being, if you are the kind

51:52.880 --> 51:58.400
 of person who takes your cues based on someone's wardrobe, as opposed to the content of your ideas,

51:58.400 --> 52:04.480
 you have no use to me as an ally. So I'd be more than happy. You preemptively abort,

52:04.480 --> 52:09.360
 rather than waste our breath. This is the deep, this is a very, very deep thing that you and I

52:09.360 --> 52:16.720
 disagree on, which is this is goes to the trolling versus the love is, I believe that person

52:16.720 --> 52:23.680
 instinctually dismisses you on the very basic surface level. Yes. But deep down, there actually,

52:23.680 --> 52:32.160
 there is a wealth of a human being that seeks the connection to seeks to understand deeply

52:32.160 --> 52:37.040
 to connect with other humans that we should speak to. Yeah, you and I completely disagree.

52:38.080 --> 52:45.040
 So you're saying, I'm saying there's no mind there, literally. Okay. So let's, I, I naturally

52:45.040 --> 52:51.200
 think the majority, so I naturally think the majority of people are, have the capacity to be

52:51.200 --> 53:02.320
 thoughtful, intelligent, and, you know, learn about ideas, ideas that they instinctually based on

53:02.320 --> 53:09.440
 their own likes, current inner circle, disagree with and learn to understand, to empathize with

53:09.440 --> 53:15.520
 the other we're like, I, and in the current climate, there's a divisiveness that discourages that.

53:15.520 --> 53:25.840
 And that's where I see the value of love, of, of encouraging people to, to strip away that surface

53:25.840 --> 53:30.960
 instinctual response based on the thing they've been taught, based on the things they listen to,

53:30.960 --> 53:38.160
 to actually think deeply. Have you ever had gone to CVS or Dwayne Reed, and your bill,

53:38.160 --> 53:43.040
 how much you owe them is $6. And you give them a $10 bill in a single and watch the look on their

53:43.040 --> 53:49.040
 face. You watch them void their bowels and panic, because you've given them $11 on a $6 bill.

53:49.600 --> 53:54.160
 This is not a mind capable or interested in thoughts and ideas and learning.

53:54.160 --> 54:01.520
 No, you're talking about the first moment of a first moment where there's an opportunity to think.

54:02.400 --> 54:08.080
 They are desperate to avoid it. No, they're just, it's an incapable of it.

54:08.080 --> 54:14.960
 I just, they have the same exact experiences I have every single day when I know it's time

54:14.960 --> 54:22.000
 for me to go out on a run of five miles or six miles or 10 miles, I'm desperate to avoid it.

54:22.000 --> 54:28.400
 And at the same time, I know I have the capacity to do it. And I'm deeply fulfilled when I do

54:28.400 --> 54:33.040
 do it, when I do overcome that challenge. You are one of the great minds of our generation.

54:33.040 --> 54:38.480
 You are telling me that any of these people can do anything close to the work you do? Not in

54:38.480 --> 54:48.160
 artificial intelligence, but in the ability to be compassionate towards other people's ideas,

54:48.160 --> 54:53.120
 like understand them enough to be able... Passion requires a certain baseline of intelligence,

54:53.120 --> 54:55.920
 because you have to perceive other people as being different, but of value.

54:55.920 --> 54:58.480
 Yeah, exactly. That's a sophisticated mindset.

54:58.480 --> 55:03.280
 I think most people are capable of it. You don't think so?

55:03.280 --> 55:04.800
 No, and nor are they interested in it.

55:05.760 --> 55:12.960
 But in that kind of, if you don't believe they're capable of it, how can anarchy be stable?

55:14.240 --> 55:18.320
 If you have a farm, there's one farmer and 50 cows, it's very stable.

55:18.320 --> 55:22.640
 You're just not, you're not asking the cows where to farm things.

55:22.640 --> 55:28.720
 Yeah, but the cows aren't intelligent enough to do damage.

55:29.440 --> 55:33.840
 Cows, cows certainly could do a lot of damage. They could trample things, they could attack you.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.800
 Cows are like, how much do they weigh? Like 4,000 pounds?

55:36.800 --> 55:39.200
 Can you connect the analogy then, because like...

55:39.200 --> 55:40.320
 Sure, you can't expect that...

55:40.960 --> 55:41.520
 Yeah.

55:41.520 --> 55:46.880
 Saying a cow is a cow isn't a slur. It's not saying you hate cows, cows, or even...

55:46.880 --> 55:50.160
 Let's say, the example I always use with good reason is dogs, okay?

55:50.160 --> 55:54.160
 I always say to study how human beings operate, watch Caesar Milan,

55:54.160 --> 55:56.320
 because human beings and dogs have coevolved.

55:56.320 --> 55:59.760
 Our minds have both evolved in parallel tracks to communicate with each other.

55:59.760 --> 56:05.200
 Dogs can be vicious. Dogs, for the most part, are great, wonderful,

56:05.200 --> 56:10.240
 but you can't expect the dog to understand certain concepts.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.280
 It's not an incident...

56:11.280 --> 56:13.200
 Now, most people are offended. Are you saying, I look like a dog?

56:13.200 --> 56:16.240
 If you're a dog person like I am, this is actually a huge compliment.

56:16.240 --> 56:17.840
 Most dogs are better than most people.

56:17.840 --> 56:24.720
 But to get the idea that this is something that is basically your peer is nonsensical.

56:24.720 --> 56:27.840
 Now, of course, this sounds arrogant and elitist and so on and so forth,

56:27.840 --> 56:32.560
 and I'm perfectly happy with that, but it is very hard to persuade me or anyone

56:32.560 --> 56:36.080
 that if you walk... George Carlin has that joke, think how smart the average person is,

56:36.080 --> 56:38.400
 then realize 50% of people are dumber than that.

56:38.400 --> 56:41.920
 If you walk around and see who's out there, these people are very kind.

56:41.920 --> 56:46.080
 They are of value. They deserve to be treated with respect.

56:46.080 --> 56:52.880
 They deserve to be secure in their person. They deserve to feel safe and to have love,

56:52.880 --> 56:59.200
 but the expectation that they should have any sort of semblance of power over me or my life

56:59.200 --> 57:02.880
 is as nonsensical as asking Lassie to be my accountant.

57:04.320 --> 57:10.960
 But that goes to power, not to the ability, the capacity to be empathetic,

57:10.960 --> 57:20.800
 compassionate, intelligent. If I were to try to prove you wrong, what would you be impressed by

57:20.800 --> 57:25.520
 about society? How would I show it to you?

57:25.520 --> 57:28.160
 That's a good question. How would you show it to me? Because I think something has to be

57:28.160 --> 57:32.560
 falsifiable if we're going to make a claim, right? So what would it...

57:33.840 --> 57:39.360
 Because we've both made claims that aren't a kind of our own interpretation based on

57:39.360 --> 57:43.440
 our interaction. Like when I open Twitter, everyone seems to say...

57:43.440 --> 57:46.640
 Why do you only follow one person? Who do you follow? Who's the one person you follow?

57:46.640 --> 57:51.520
 Stoic Emperor. I follow a lot of people. I have a script that...

57:51.520 --> 57:53.840
 Of course you do. I have a robot.

57:53.840 --> 57:58.640
 I have an entire interface. So I think Twitter is really...

57:58.640 --> 58:04.080
 This is real love. It's not ironic love. I love watching it, and I'm sure you do too.

58:04.080 --> 58:08.080
 I love watching a quality of mind at work, because when someone has a quality of mind,

58:08.080 --> 58:12.640
 they're often not self aware. I catch this on myself of how it operates.

58:12.640 --> 58:15.280
 And then when other people see it, they're like, oh my god, this is so beautiful,

58:15.280 --> 58:18.640
 because there's such an innocence to it. But when I open Twitter,

58:20.880 --> 58:24.000
 energize, there's a lot of love on Twitter. People say like...

58:24.000 --> 58:26.960
 I love Twitter. I agree. You don't think I have a lot of love on Twitter?

58:26.960 --> 58:32.240
 My fans pay my rent. I mean, I don't know your experience of Twitter,

58:32.240 --> 58:35.440
 but when I look at your... Which is a fundamentally different thing.

58:35.440 --> 58:39.440
 I'm saying my experience from the... So maybe you can tell me what your experience is like

58:39.440 --> 58:49.920
 as a human. So when I observe your Twitter, I think... I wouldn't call it love. I would call it fun.

58:51.120 --> 58:56.720
 And because of that, that's a different kind of... Love emerges from that,

58:56.720 --> 59:01.680
 because people kind of learn that we're having... This is like game night.

59:01.680 --> 59:10.240
 Like, we can talk shit a little bit. You can even pull in...

59:10.240 --> 59:13.920
 You can make fun of people. You can have the crazy uncle come over that

59:15.200 --> 59:19.360
 is a huge Trump supporter or somebody who hates Trump, and you can have a little fun.

59:19.360 --> 59:22.160
 Again, it's a different kind of thing. I wouldn't be able to...

59:25.280 --> 59:27.440
 You're the host of game night? Yes, yes.

59:27.440 --> 59:32.720
 So I wouldn't be able to host that kind of game night? I imagine you're programming your robots

59:32.720 --> 59:36.320
 and you're asking what is fun and it just starts sparking. Exactly.

59:37.360 --> 59:44.720
 What is fun? So the robots in my life that survive are the ones that don't...

59:45.680 --> 59:50.960
 That survive that whole programming process. So they're kind of like...

59:50.960 --> 59:55.360
 They're kind of like the idiot from just to ask you. They're very simple minded robots.

59:55.360 --> 59:59.360
 Fun is moving a can from one table to another.

1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:04.560
 That's game night for our kin. You know what I'm on my quotes is,

1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:08.480
 and I think about this every day, and I mean it with every fiber of my being.

1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:13.120
 We're born knowing that life is a magical adventure and it takes them years to train

1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:17.680
 us to think otherwise. And I think that Willy Wonka approach, it's a very Kamu approach.

1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:22.640
 It's something I believe with every fiber of my being. I try to spread that as much as possible.

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:28.160
 I think it is very sad. I'm not being sarcastic. It comes off as condescending. I mean it at face

1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:32.400
 value. It's very sad how many people are not receptive to that. And I think a lot of those

1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:37.440
 function how they were raised. And I could have very easily with my upbringing have not

1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:44.400
 maintained that perspective. And there's a lot of... I have a lot of friends in recovery, like AA,

1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:50.960
 and they have an expression, not my circus, not my monkeys. That you can't really take on other

1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:54.400
 people's problems on your own. At a certain point, they have to do the work themselves,

1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:59.840
 because you can only do so much externally. And there are a lot of very damaged people out there.

1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:06.400
 And there are damaged people who revel in being damaged. And they are damaged people who desperately,

1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:10.720
 desperately, desperately want to be well, who desperately want to be happy, who desperately

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:16.960
 want to find joy. So if I can be the one, and as arrogant as this sounds, I'll own it, who does

1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:22.160
 give them that fun. And to tell them, it doesn't have to be like you thought. It could be, it's

1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.640
 going to hurt, it's going to suck, but it's still a magical adventure and you're going to be okay,

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:31.680
 because you've been through worse. If that could be my message, I would own it all day long.

1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:37.120
 And so what does adventure look like for you? Because I mean, it actually boils down to,

1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:44.960
 I still disagree with you. I think trolling can be and very often is destructive for society.

1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:50.480
 Yes, I want to destroy society. That is the goal. I want to help many people.

1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:52.560
 Unironically, okay. Unironically, yes.

1:01:54.640 --> 1:01:56.480
 What do I do with that? Okay, so.

1:01:56.480 --> 1:01:58.800
 Whatever you want. Do with that will is the hall of the law.

1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:04.640
 Like I just want to, so you're hosting game night and I just want to play monopoly. I want to play,

1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:08.800
 what's the risk? Okay, I want to play these games.

1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:09.920
 And you're saying. Those are aggressive games.

1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:14.560
 Yeah, I was trying to think of a friendlier game, but they're all kind of aggressive.

1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:19.440
 Battle ship, access and allies, you know, fun stuff.

1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:27.680
 But like, so that's an adventure, but you're saying that we want to destroy everything,

1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:31.440
 even like the rules of those games are not like.

1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:35.600
 You voluntarily agree to those rules. The point is, if someone comes in who's not,

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:40.000
 who no one invited to game night and are telling you, no, when you play monopoly,

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.600
 you have to get money when you land in free parking or you don't.

1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:47.120
 It's like, who are you? We're having our own fun and you smell.

1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:52.800
 I don't know, but there's an aggressive.

1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:55.520
 There's an aggression. Let me, let me speak to that, which I think you're picking up on.

1:02:56.320 --> 1:02:58.320
 I had a friend named Martha, Marcia, excuse me.

1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:01.840
 She ran something called cuddle parties, which people laughed at about a lot back in the day.

1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:04.640
 And the premise of the cuddle parties, everyone got together and cuddled, right?

1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:08.800
 And it's like, aha, then you stop to think about and you realize physical context is extremely

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:12.560
 important and a lot of people don't have it. And if this is a mechanism of people getting that,

1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:15.200
 it actually is going to have profound positive psychological consequences.

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:18.400
 So after she explained it, I'm like, okay, we laughed at this because it's weird.

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:20.400
 And now that I think about it, this is wonderful.

1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:25.680
 And I asked her about like, like the tough question go, what if guys get turned on?

1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:28.640
 And on their website, it's even has a rule, like do not fear the erection, right?

1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:31.280
 Because it's going to be a natural consequence of physical proximity.

1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:33.840
 And the point she goes, she said this, I think about this all the time.

1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:37.840
 People will take as much space as you let them.

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:41.920
 It is incumbent on each of us to set our own boundaries.

1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:45.520
 We all have to learn when to say no, you're making me uncomfortable.

1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:49.520
 If someone doesn't respect your right to have your boundary to be uncomfortable,

1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:51.120
 this person is not your friend.

1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:53.520
 Now they can say, I don't understand.

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:55.520
 Like, why is this okay? Why is that not?

1:03:55.520 --> 1:03:58.480
 Let me know you better so I'm respectful of you.

1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:01.520
 But if they roll their eyes and they're like, get over, I'm going to do what I want.

1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:04.080
 This person is not interested in knowing you as a human being.

1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:06.400
 Okay.

1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:07.520
 And that is the aggression.

1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:09.200
 It is, you have to draw those lines.

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:14.000
 I mean, but that's a very positive way of phrasing that aggression.

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:15.440
 I'm a very positive person.

1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:19.200
 But the trolling, there's a destructive thing to it.

1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:19.200
 Yes.

1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:21.120
 That hurts others.

1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:21.600
 Yes.

1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:23.920
 But it's not bad people.

1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:27.120
 I only troll as a reaction or towards those in power.

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:28.000
 Okay.

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.720
 So maybe let's talk about trolling a little bit because

1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:36.560
 trolling, when it can, maybe you can correct me, but I've seen it become a game for people

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:39.360
 that's enjoyable in itself.

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:42.480
 I disagree with that.

1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:43.840
 That's not a good thing.

1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:48.800
 If you are there just to hurt innocent people, you are a horrible human being.

1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:52.320
 But doesn't trolling too easily become that?

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.400
 I don't know about easily.

1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:57.200
 Let me give you an example of where trolling came from.

1:04:57.200 --> 1:04:59.440
 The original troll was Andy Kaufman.

1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:01.040
 He was on the show Taxi.

1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:03.840
 He was a performance artist, not a standard comedian.

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:06.640
 And this is a quintessential example of trolling.

1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:10.000
 He had a character where he was basically like a lounge singer.

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:14.160
 He had these glasses on and just a terrible singer and so on and so forth.

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:15.440
 And he denied it was him.

1:05:16.640 --> 1:05:19.680
 And he came out and I'm blanking on the guy's name.

1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:20.320
 I can't believe it.

1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:20.960
 Tony Clifton.

1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:20.960
 Wow.

1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:26.000
 He came out in the audience and he goes, you know, my wife died a few years ago.

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:29.440
 Every time I look at my daughter, Sarah's eyes, I can see my wife, Sarah, come out here,

1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:30.480
 let's do a duet.

1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:34.160
 And Sarah was like 11, sits on his lap, they start singing duet.

1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:36.880
 Her voice cracks, he smacks her across the face.

1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:37.680
 What the hell are you doing?

1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:39.280
 You're making ass on me in front of these people.

1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:41.280
 There, there, she starts crying.

1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:45.440
 The audience is booing and he goes, don't boo her, you're just going to make her cry more.

1:05:45.440 --> 1:05:50.240
 Now it ends, this wasn't his daughter, it wasn't even child, it was an actress.

1:05:50.240 --> 1:05:51.440
 This was all set up.

1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:56.720
 He's exploiting their love of children in order to force them to be performers.

1:05:56.720 --> 1:05:58.320
 That is trolling.

1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:00.000
 No one is actually getting hurt.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.960
 It's a humorous, though twisted exchange.

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:10.880
 If you go online looking for weak people and you are there to denigrate them just for them

1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:16.080
 being weak or in some way inferior to you, that is the wrong approach.

1:06:16.080 --> 1:06:18.640
 I am best on the counter punch.

1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:21.440
 I am best on the counter punch.

1:06:21.440 --> 1:06:24.720
 A lot of times people come to me and they'll be like, I hope you die.

1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:26.160
 You're ugly, you're disgusting.

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:29.280
 And there's this great quote from Billy Idol, which I'm going to mangle where he's something

1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:30.000
 effective.

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:32.880
 I love it when people are rude to me, then I can stop pretending to be nice.

1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:35.280
 Then you start fights.

1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:38.720
 Now it's a chance for me to finish it and make an example of this person.

1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:42.960
 But that's very, very different from, I'm going to go around and humiliate people for

1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:44.720
 the sake of doing it, in my view.

1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:48.400
 And I can see how one would lead to the other.

1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:48.960
 Yeah.

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:50.800
 But that's my fundamental concern with it.

1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:59.520
 So my dream is to put, use technology, create platforms that increase the amount of love

1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:00.480
 in the world.

1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:05.040
 And to me trolling is doing the opposite.

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:09.680
 So like Andy Kaufman is brilliant.

1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:13.680
 So I love, obviously, it sounds like I'm a robot saying, I love humor.

1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:13.920
 Okay.

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:16.240
 Humor is good.

1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:19.440
 One, one, one, zero, one, one, one, one.

1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:24.880
 But like it's, I just see like 4chan.

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:29.360
 I see that you can often see that humor quickly turned.

1:07:29.360 --> 1:07:29.600
 Yeah.

1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:33.440
 Because what happens is a lot of low status people, this is their one mechanism through

1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:36.880
 sadism to feel empowered.

1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:39.040
 And then they can hide behind, well, I'm just joking.

1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:40.160
 Yeah.

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:41.280
 Like there's this dark thing.

1:07:41.280 --> 1:07:41.440
 Yeah.

1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:42.400
 That's not acceptable.

1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:44.960
 There's a dark LOL that people do.

1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:50.240
 Which is like, they'll say like the shittiest thing and then do LOL after.

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:56.160
 Like as if, I don't even know, like what is happening in the dark mind of yours?

1:07:56.160 --> 1:07:58.880
 Because they are feeling powerless in their lives.

1:07:58.880 --> 1:07:59.360
 Right.

1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:02.960
 And they see someone who they perceive as higher status or more powerful than them or

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:08.480
 even not appear and they, through their words, cause a reaction in this person.

1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:12.400
 So they feel like they are in a very literal sense making a difference on earth and they

1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:13.680
 matter in a very dark way.

1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:15.120
 It's disturbing.

1:08:15.120 --> 1:08:20.320
 This is not, I mean, it's unfortunate that that term trolling is used for that as opposed

1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.200
 to what Andy Kaufman does as opposed to what I do.

1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:30.160
 It's, it really is a sinister thing and it's something I'm not at all a fan of.

1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:32.640
 How do we, how do we fight that?

1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:38.320
 So like a neighboring concept of that is conspiracy theories, which is.

1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:39.920
 I don't think they're neighboring at all.

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:42.560
 Let me, let me give a sort of.

1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:49.760
 Naive perspective, maybe you can educate me on this from my perspective, conspiracy theories

1:08:49.760 --> 1:09:01.200
 are these constructs of ideas that go deeper and deeper and deeper into creating worlds

1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:10.880
 where there's powerful pedophiles, controlling things like these very sophisticated models

1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:17.520
 of the world that in part might be true, but in large part, I would say our, our figments

1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:24.480
 of imagination that become really useful constructs and self enforcing, self enforcing

1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:34.800
 for then feeding like empowering the trolls to attack the powerful, the conventionally powerful.

1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:37.040
 I don't think that that's a function of conspiracy theories.

1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:40.240
 Now let's talk about conspiracy theories because one of my quotes is you take one red

1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:47.840
 pill, not the whole bottle, this concept that everything in life is at the function of a

1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:54.560
 small cadre of individuals would be for many people reassuring because as bad as it looks,

1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:59.600
 you know they, whoever they are, it's usually the Jews aren't going to let it get that bad

1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:06.480
 that they will pull back or the black pill is that they aren't intentionally trying to destroy

1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:08.800
 everything and there's nothing we can do when we're doomed.

1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:12.320
 And there's an amazing book by Arthur Herman called The Idea of the Clan of Western History.

1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:16.880
 I, it's one of my top 10 books where he goes through every 20 years how there's a different

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:21.760
 population that say it's the end of the world, here's the proof. And very often the proof is

1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:25.600
 something that is kind of self fulfilling where there's no, it's not falsifiable.

1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:29.680
 And we both have to think of ways to falsify our claims from earlier.

1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:36.640
 So it is a big danger. It's a big danger online because very quickly if someone

1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:41.600
 who you thought was good but now is bad on one aspect, well they're controlled opposition

1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:48.000
 or they've been taken over or they've been kind of appropriated by the bad people, whoever those

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.760
 bad people would be. I don't know that I have a good answer for this. I don't think it's as

1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:57.680
 pervasive as people think. The number of people who believe conspiracy there.

1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:03.360
 Right. I mean, and also conspiracy theory is a term used to dismiss ideas that

1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:07.520
 have some currency. The Constitutional Convention was a conspiracy. The Founding Fathers got

1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:10.640
 together secretly under sword of secrecy in Philadelphia, said we're throwing out the

1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:14.240
 Art of Confederation. We're making new government, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Luther Martin left

1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:17.840
 and he told everyone this is a conspiracy and they're like, yeah, whatever, Luther Martin.

1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:22.000
 So, and Jeffrey Epstein was a conspiracy. Harvey Weinstein was a conspiracy. Bill Cosby

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.960
 was a conspiracy. They all knew. They didn't care. Communist infiltration in America. There's a great

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:34.320
 book by Eugene Lyons called The Red Decade. They all knew the every atrocity that was done under

1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:38.960
 Stalinism was excused in the West. And if you didn't believe it, oh, you've got this crazy

1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:44.080
 anti Russia conspiracy. So it's a term that is weaponized in a negative sense, but that does

1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:50.240
 not at all imply that it does not have very negative real life consequences because it's

1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:56.400
 kind of a cult of one, right? Like I'm at home on my computer. I bang to this ideology. Anyone who

1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:02.240
 doesn't agree with me, they are blind. They're oblivious. Mom and dad, my friends, you don't get

1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:08.320
 it. We were warned about people like you. And I think there's a very heavy correlation and

1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:12.320
 I'm not a psychiatrist, of course, between that and certain types of mild mental illness,

1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:15.360
 like, you know, some kind of paranoia, schizophrenia, things like that, because

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.080
 after a certain point, if everything is a function, this conspiracy, it's, it's,

1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:25.440
 there's no randomness or beauty in life. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if you can say anything

1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:33.600
 interesting about it in the way of advice of how to take a step into conspiracy theory world

1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:39.600
 without completely going like diving deep, because it seems like that's what happens.

1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:44.000
 People can't look at Jeffrey Epstein. I can tell you what the device that has started.

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:50.640
 Seriously and rigorously without going because you can look at Jeffrey Epstein and say there's

1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:55.920
 a deeper thing. You can always go deeper. It's like Jeffrey Epstein was just a tool of

1:12:57.440 --> 1:13:00.560
 the lizard people and the lizard people are the, well, they say Satanists.

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:08.560
 In this case, and somehow recently, very popular spedophiles somehow always involved.

1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:15.040
 I'm not understanding any of that. I legitimately, I say this both humorously and seriously,

1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:20.480
 I need to look into it. And I guess the bigger question I'm asking, how does a serious human

1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:27.200
 being, somebody with a position at a respectable university, like look at a conspiracy theory

1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:32.320
 and look into it. When I look at somebody like Jeffrey Epstein who had a role at MIT.

1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:41.440
 Yeah. Oh yeah. And I think I'm not happy personally. I didn't, I wasn't there when

1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:47.040
 Jeffrey Epstein was there. I'm not happy with the behavior of people now about Jeffrey Epstein,

1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:52.960
 about the bureaucracy and the everybody's trying to keep quiet, hoping it blows over

1:13:52.960 --> 1:14:00.080
 without really looking into any, like looking in a deep philosophical way of like,

1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:04.800
 how do we let this human being be among us? Can I give you a better example?

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:09.680
 Sure. That is kind of conspiratorial. The Speaker of the House, the longest serving

1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:13.600
 Republican Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert was a pedophile. He went to jail.

1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:17.600
 The Democrats don't throw this in the Republicans faces every five minutes.

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:23.520
 Not even Democratic activists. I find that very, very odd and not what I would predict.

1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:27.280
 Now, I'm not saying there's some kind of conspiracy, but when it comes to things

1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:32.160
 like sexual predation, which is something that I'm very, very concerned about. I'm an uncle now.

1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:38.800
 My sister just had her second kid recently. He's adorable. It's something that I don't

1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:45.680
 understand. It feels as if there's a lot of people who want this to all go away.

1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:50.000
 Now, I think it's also because we don't have the vocabulary and framework to discuss it,

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.360
 because when you start talking about things like children and these kind of issues,

1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:58.240
 we want to believe it's all crap, because it's for those of us who aren't in this kind of mindset,

1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:02.560
 the idea that this happens to kids and happens frequently is something so horrible

1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:07.200
 that it's just like, I don't even want to hear it. That does these children and adult survivors

1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:10.640
 and enormous disservice. I don't know that I have any particular insight on this.

1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:16.240
 But see, how do you, the Catholic Church, again, there's all these topics that...

1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:21.920
 Public school teachers are far more proportionally predators of children than the Catholic Church.

1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:30.320
 I don't know. You're right. Perhaps I've been reading a lot about Stalin and Hitler.

1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:36.720
 Yeah. Somehow it's more comforting to be able to... And then... And then the atrocities that

1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:40.880
 are happening now, it's a little bit more difficult because... There was a New York Times article

1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:44.560
 starting to interrupt you where they were had people tracking down child pornography.

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:48.160
 And I think the article said that they didn't have enough people just to cover the

1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:54.320
 videotapes of infants being raped. And we can even wrap our heads around like reading Lolita,

1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:59.120
 like, okay, she's 14, 12, okay, it's still a female, an infant. It's something that,

1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:03.040
 again, like with the Stalin example, we sat down here for 100 years. We would never think

1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:05.440
 it's something like this. Think of it in a sexual context. It makes no sense.

1:16:06.560 --> 1:16:10.560
 So, and the fact that this is international, okay, we eliminated completely in America.

1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:14.800
 Well, then they're going to go find... There's infants all over the world. There's video cameras

1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:19.760
 all over the world. So then it has to become a conspiracy because I... Someone has to film it.

1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:25.840
 I'm filming it. You're buying it. Your kid. It is literally a conspiratorial, not in the sense

1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:31.600
 of like a mafia conspiracy or some government Illuminati, but there is our networks designed

1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:39.520
 to produce this product. See, but like what I'm trying to do now, I mean, part of the... One

1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:45.440
 of the nice things with like a podcast and other things I'm involved with is removing myself from

1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:49.280
 having any kind of boss so I can do whatever that helps. Yes. Oh, it's so, it's so wonderful.

1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:52.400
 That had just happened to me. It's the most wonderful thing ever.

1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:57.680
 So I could do... I can actually, in moderation, consider like look into stuff.

1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:01.600
 Careful though. I was going to write a book about this that people pointed out. You sure want to do

1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:05.520
 this research? Because if you start googling around for this kind of stuff, it's on your computer.

1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:10.960
 Oh, in that sense. Yeah. I'm more concerned about, you know, it's the Nietzsche thing,

1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:15.840
 looking into the abyss. Like you want to be very... Yeah. I believe I can do this kind of thing in

1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:22.880
 moderation without slipping into the depths. Of course. I think that's intelligence that's...

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:31.120
 Recently, quote unquote, looked into like the UFO community, the extraterrestrial, whatever

1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:37.120
 community. I think it always frustrated me that the scientific community like rolled their eyes

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:42.720
 at all the UFO sightings, all that kind of stuff. Even though there could be fascinating, beautiful,

1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:46.160
 physical... Like, first of all, there could legit... Like ball lightning.

1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:51.040
 Or the ball lightning, right? That's at the very basic level is a fascinating thing.

1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:59.440
 And also, it could be something like... I mean, I don't know, but it could be something interesting,

1:17:59.440 --> 1:18:05.120
 like worth looking into. My grandfather was an air traffic controller back in the Soviet Union.

1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:10.320
 And he said, we saw this stuff all the time. These are planes that were not moving or whatever

1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:15.120
 things that were not moving according to anything we knew about. So it's absolutely real. He's not

1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:22.480
 some jerk with an iPhone in his backyard. This is a military professional who understood technology,

1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:27.520
 who knew where the secret bases were. So if he's telling me, it's some... Doesn't mean it's Martians,

1:18:27.520 --> 1:18:31.200
 but he's telling me there's something there. And there are many examples of these like military

1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:36.720
 people. These aren't some laymen who sees a story. These are legit people. Yeah. And so you can dismiss...

1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:40.160
 When you're talking about professionals who are around aircraft all the time,

1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:43.520
 who are familiar with aircraft at the highest levels, and they're seeing things that they

1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:47.280
 can't explain, they're clearly not stupid and they're clearly not underformed.

1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:54.000
 So Mike, there's different ways to dismiss ideas. For example, you were saying that trolling is a

1:18:54.000 --> 1:19:01.440
 good mechanism against that, but I'm not dismissing it by like rolling my eyes. I'm considering

1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:05.680
 legitimately that you're way smarter than me and you understand the world better than me.

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:10.320
 Like I'm allowing myself to consider that possibility and thinking about it. Like maybe

1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:16.240
 that's true. Like seriously considering it. That's what I feel the way people should approach

1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:22.320
 intelligent people, serious quote unquote people, scientists should approach conspiracy theories.

1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:29.280
 Like look at it carefully, you know. First of all, is it possible that the earth is flat?

1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:34.000
 It's not trivial to show that the earth is not flat. It's a very good exercise. You should go

1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:41.600
 through it. Yes. But once you go through it, you realize that based on a lot of data and a lot of

1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:44.720
 evidence and there's a lot of different experiments, you can do yourself actually

1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:49.920
 to show that the earth is not flat. Okay. The same kind of process can be taken

1:19:50.800 --> 1:19:55.680
 for a lot of different conspiracy theories and it's helpful. And without slipping into the

1:19:55.680 --> 1:20:04.320
 depths of lizard people running everything. That's where I've now listened to two episodes of

1:20:06.480 --> 1:20:17.280
 Alex Jones's show because he goes crazy deep into different kind of worldviews that I was not

1:20:17.280 --> 1:20:21.600
 familiar with. Right. And I don't know what to make of it. I mean, the reason I've been listening

1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:27.680
 to it is because there's been a lot of discussions about platforming of different people. Yeah.

1:20:27.680 --> 1:20:34.720
 And I've been thinking about what a censorship mean. I've been thinking about whether, because Joe

1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:44.480
 Rogan said he's going to have Alex on again. And then I enjoyed it as a fan, just the entertainment

1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:52.000
 of it. But then I actually listened to Alex as thinking, is this human being dangerous for the

1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:56.720
 world? Like, is the ideas he's saying dangerous for the world? I'm more concerned with the Russian

1:20:56.720 --> 1:21:01.520
 conspiracy that we had for three years. And the claim that our election was not legitimate and

1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:06.000
 that everyone in the Trump White House is a stooge of Putin. And the people who said this had no

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:10.960
 consequences for this. Alex Jones doesn't have the respect that they do. These are both areas of

1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:17.280
 concern for me. But he might, if there's, if he's given more platforms. So like the people who've,

1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:24.640
 and I'd be curious, I'm also a little bit, I don't know what to think about the idea that

1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:30.320
 Russians hack the election. It seems too easily accepted in the mainstream media.

1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:37.760
 Hillary Clinton said that how they did it was they had ads on the dark web. Now,

1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:42.960
 you and I both know what the dark web is. So the possibility of ads in the dark web

1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:48.240
 having an influence, a proportional influence on the election is literally zero.

1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:55.600
 Perhaps I should look into it more carefully, but I've found very little good data on exactly

1:21:55.600 --> 1:22:00.880
 what did the Russians do to hack elections. Like, technically speaking, what are we talking about

1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:05.840
 here? Like, as opposed to these kind of weird, like the best thing there's a couple of books and

1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:14.640
 like reporting on like farms, like a patrol farms, patrol farms. But let's see the data,

1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:19.760
 like how many exactly what are we talking about? Like what were they doing relative,

1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:27.920
 not just like some anecdotal discussions of, but like relative to the bigger, the size of Facebook.

1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:34.960
 Like if there's a few people, several hundreds, say the posting different political things on

1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:41.360
 Facebook relative to the full size of Facebook, let's look at the full size.

1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:42.640
 Right. You're thinking like a scientist.

1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:50.320
 The actual impact. Like because it's fascinating the social dynamics of viral information of videos

1:22:50.320 --> 1:22:56.160
 when Donald Trump retweets something. I think that's understudied the effect of that.

1:22:56.160 --> 1:23:06.640
 Like he retweeted a clip with Joe Rogan and Mike Tyson, where Mike Tyson says that he finds

1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:11.200
 fighting orgasmic. I don't understand it, but they'd be fascinating to think like,

1:23:11.200 --> 1:23:19.120
 what is the ripple effect on the social dynamic of our society from retweeting a clip about Mike

1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:26.560
 Tyson? What's your favorite Trump tweet? I tuned him out a long time ago, unfortunately.

1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:36.080
 This goes to the, you and I have a different relation with Donald Trump. You appreciate

1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:44.320
 the art form of trolling. It's nonsexual. Nonsexual, yeah. So I tend to prefer Bill Clinton. He's

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:52.480
 more my type. No, I'm just kidding. You don't like that consent stuff. No, you appreciate the art

1:23:52.480 --> 1:24:02.880
 form of trolling. And Donald Trump is a master. He's the Da Vinci of trolling. So I tend to think

1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:07.360
 that trolling is ultimately destructive for society. And then Donald Trump takes nothing

1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:11.280
 seriously. He's playing a game. He'd make a game out of everything. He takes a lot of things seriously.

1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:16.720
 I think he's very committed to international peace. Sorry. I shouldn't speak so strong.

1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:24.400
 I think he takes, actually, yes, a lot of things seriously. I meant on Twitter and the game of

1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:36.880
 politics, he is, he only takes irreverently. Yeah. Yeah. And I appreciate it. I just would like to

1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:45.600
 focus on genuine, real expressions of humanity, especially positive. Well, this is one. This

1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:50.240
 is my favorite tweet. My fans got it lasered, etched, and put in a block of loose light for me.

1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:56.800
 And he said, every time I speak of the losers and haters, I do so with great affection. They

1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:01.520
 cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up. That's an actual Trump tweet. It's my favorite one.

1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:07.440
 That's kind of nice. That's love. That's love. That's kind of nice. Great affection.

1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:13.840
 That, I mean, exclamation point. Even,

1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:26.000
 I broke legs. What is love? Yeah, the sparks are flying. But I have to kind of analyze that from

1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:31.440
 like a literary perspective, but it seems like there's love in there, like a little bit. It's

1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:35.440
 a little bit lighthearted. Because he's saying, even when I'm going after them, don't take it so

1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:40.960
 seriously. Yeah. That's nice. It is nice. It's acknowledging the game of it. That's nice.

1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:47.840
 He's not always nice. He's very, very vicious. Yeah. Very vicious. He's done things that I can

1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:53.440
 tell you about that I'm like, this is a bad person. What do you think about one of the, okay,

1:25:53.440 --> 1:26:00.800
 listen, I'm not, I, for people listening, I do not have Trump derangement syndrome. I don't,

1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:07.760
 I see, I try to look for the good and the bad and everybody. One thing, perhaps it's irrational,

1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:16.080
 but perhaps because I've been reading history, I, the one triggering thing for me is the delaying

1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:24.640
 of elections. I believe in elections and this is, this is the part that you probably disagree with.

1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:31.600
 But I, you know, I believe in the value of people voting and I just seem too many dictators.

1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:39.040
 The place where they finally, the big switch happens when you question the legitimacy of

1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:42.160
 elections. We've been questioning the legitimacy of elections for the last three years.

1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:47.680
 I've only heard Donald Trump do it last like year, but the last three years you're saying somebody

1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:52.880
 else. You don't think not my president illegitimate. We're not going to normalize him as president.

1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:56.720
 Russia hacked this election. impeached. You're not a real president. You don't think that's

1:26:56.720 --> 1:27:01.920
 questioning legitimacy of 2016? Yeah, it's a good, I haven't been paying attention enough,

1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:08.000
 but I would, I would imagine that argument has been that I haven't actually heard

1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:12.160
 too many people, but I imagine that's been a popular thing to say. Oh, very much so, yeah.

1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:20.320
 Okay. I, but nevertheless, that's a part that didn't, that's not a statement that gained power

1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:30.160
 enough to say that Barack Obama will keep being president or Hillary Clinton should be president.

1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:33.200
 Newsweek had that article how Hillary Clinton could still be president. Newsweek.

1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:38.720
 No, but she's not. That's what I'm saying. My worry isn't, my worry isn't

1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:47.280
 saying that the election was illegitimate and people whining and mass scale and then Fox News

1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:52.640
 or CNN reporting for years or books being written for years. My worry is legitimately

1:27:53.360 --> 1:28:00.400
 martial law. A person's mate stays president. So here's the issue. Like there's a, there's a

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:05.520
 big shift that happens. I did a book on North Korea. I'm not someone who thinks

1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:09.200
 dictatorship should be taken lightly. I'm not someone who thinks it can't happen here.

1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:14.560
 I think a lot of times people are desperate for dictatorship. So I'm with you. And I think this

1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:18.480
 is something, if you're going to hand wave it away, everyone else hand waved it away. Hitler's

1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:22.880
 never going to be chancellor. He's a lunatic. He's a joke. He's a joke. They couldn't find a

1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:28.400
 publisher for Mein Kampf in English because this is some guy from some random minor party in Germany

1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:33.120
 spouting nonsense. Who's going to read this crap? You know, so I completely agree with you in that

1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:38.480
 regard. But you don't think we're there. My point is Donald Trump this year had every

1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:45.040
 pathway open to him to declare martial law. The cities are being burned down. He could have very

1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:49.280
 easily sent in the tanks and people would have been applauding him from his side.

1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:52.880
 I think we feel so good right now. But am I wrong though? No, I, I, what he did,

1:28:52.880 --> 1:29:01.120
 he tweeted out to Mayor Wheeler of Portland. He said, call me. We will, we will solve this in minutes.

1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:07.120
 But you have to call. And he sat in his hands and they said, oh, it's his fault. The city is burning

1:29:07.120 --> 1:29:12.160
 down. He's not doing anything. And he goes, I'm not doing anything until you ask me to do it.

1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:18.560
 So I think that is even if you think he's an aspiring dictator, that is at least a sign

1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:25.680
 that there is some restraint on his aspirations. Can I just take that in as a beautiful,

1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:32.480
 like moment of hope? So I'm going to remember this moment. Beautiful Ted Cruz. Beautiful Ted.

1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:39.040
 I'm going to, I'm going to remember this. I mean, I should say that perhaps I'm irrationally,

1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:44.800
 this is the one moment where I feel myself being a little unhealthy. I think there's a

1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:50.960
 asymmetry because it's kind of like, okay, either I, if I leave the house, it's like Russian roulette.

1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:54.880
 Yeah. Maybe it's like a one in six shot. I'm pulling the trigger. I'm killing myself, but

1:29:54.880 --> 1:30:00.640
 that's one in six. That's not, and the consequences are so dire that a little paranoia would go a

1:30:00.640 --> 1:30:07.840
 long way. There's something that you can't go back. Yeah. It's an asymmetry. Yeah. The thing is,

1:30:07.840 --> 1:30:14.800
 the thing that makes Donald Trump new to me, and again, I'm a little naive in these things, but

1:30:15.840 --> 1:30:26.640
 he surprised me in how many ways he just didn't play by the rules. Yeah. And he's made me

1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:34.400
 a little aunt in this aunt colony think like, well, do you have to play by the rules at all?

1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:41.840
 Right. Why are we having elections? Why did you say it's coronavirus time? It's

1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:50.400
 not healthy to have elections. If I put my dictator hat on. Nancy Pelosi said that Joe Biden should

1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:57.680
 debate. Yeah. Did she? Yes. She says she shouldn't dignify Trump for the debate. He's the president.

1:30:57.680 --> 1:31:02.000
 He could be the worst president on earth, evil, despicable monster. I'll take that as an argument.

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:05.360
 So she's playing politics, but she's okay. I don't think that's playing politics. I think when

1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:11.680
 there's a certain point when things get, when you start attacking institutions for the emergencies

1:31:11.680 --> 1:31:16.640
 at the moment and acting arbitrarily, that is when things are the slippery slope. Yeah. So

1:31:16.640 --> 1:31:20.480
 you're saying debates is one of the institutions. Like that's one of the traditions to have the

1:31:20.480 --> 1:31:24.800
 debates. I think the debates are extremely important. Now, I don't think that someone's a

1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:28.240
 good debater is going to be a good president. I mean, that's a big problem. But you're just saying

1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:33.120
 this is attacking just yet another tradition, yet another. You know, like how if you're dating,

1:31:33.120 --> 1:31:36.480
 if you're married to someone and someone throws out the word divorce, you can't unring that bell,

1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:41.680
 you threw it out there. Yeah. I'm saying you don't throw things out like that unless you really

1:31:41.680 --> 1:31:46.000
 are ready to go down this road. And I think that is, there's nothing in the Constitution about

1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:50.880
 debates. We've only had them since 1980. But still, I think they are extremely important.

1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:55.280
 It's also a great chance for Joe Biden to tell him to his face. You're full of crap. Here's what

1:31:55.280 --> 1:32:00.080
 you did. Here's what you did. Here's what you did. So fascinating that you're both, you acknowledge

1:32:00.080 --> 1:32:07.360
 that and you also see the value of tearing down the entire thing. So you're both worried about

1:32:08.080 --> 1:32:14.000
 no debates, or at least in your voice, in your tone. There's a great quote by Chesterton. I'm

1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:17.600
 not a fan of him at all. But he says, before you tear down a fence, make sure you know why

1:32:17.600 --> 1:32:23.600
 they put it up first. So I am for tearing it all down, but there's something called a control

1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:30.480
 demolition, like building seven. Allegedly. We knew we were in Tel Aviv.

1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:37.040
 Hashtag, building seven. We knew we were in Tel Aviv. Wow, you're faster than me.

1:32:38.240 --> 1:32:42.080
 You're operating at a different level. I need to upgrade my operating system.

1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:52.320
 I told you Windows 95. Yeah. Building seven. It's like Indiana Jones, right? If you're

1:32:52.320 --> 1:32:56.240
 going to tear, pull something away, make sure you have something in place first, as opposed to just

1:32:56.240 --> 1:33:01.840
 breaking it, and then just, especially in politics, because it escalates. And when things escalate

1:33:01.840 --> 1:33:07.040
 without any kind of response, it could go in a very bad, that's when the polling comes in.

1:33:07.040 --> 1:33:16.800
 So what's your prediction about the Biden Trump debates? Again, I just have this weird,

1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:22.720
 maybe we'll return to, maybe not in this, how do we put more love into the world? And like,

1:33:22.720 --> 1:33:31.600
 one of the things that worries me about the debates is it'll be the world's greatest troll

1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:41.040
 against the grandpa on the porch. For crap, this pants. Yeah. And it will not put more love into

1:33:41.040 --> 1:33:50.480
 the world. It will create more mockery. Joe Biden did a great job against Paul Ryan in 2012.

1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:54.800
 Paul Ryan was no lightweight. No one thought he was a lightweight. Joe Biden handed Sarah

1:33:54.800 --> 1:33:58.880
 Pale and her ass in 2008, which isn't as easy to do as you think, because she's a female,

1:33:58.880 --> 1:34:01.120
 so you're going to come off as bullying. That's something you have to worry about.

1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:07.680
 So the guy isn't, I think he is in the stages of cognitive decline.

1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:13.040
 So I think it's going to be interesting. I want it to be

1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:19.840
 like Mike Tyson beating up a child, because it'll be a source of amusement to me,

1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:24.720
 but I don't know how it's going to go. Is it possible that Joe Biden will be the Mike Tyson?

1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:29.200
 Yes, because in his last debate with Bernie, he was perfectly fine. And again, the guy was

1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:34.880
 a senator for decades. And I don't think anyone, if you looked at Joe Biden in 2010,

1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:38.560
 would have thought this guy is going to have his ass handed him a debate. You wouldn't think that at

1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:44.320
 all. So I don't know who we're going to see. Plus, he's got a lot of room to attack Trump.

1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:49.280
 So I'm sure he's going to come strapped and ready, and he's going to have his talking points

1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:52.720
 and watch Trump dance, try to tap dance around him. And if he's in a position,

1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:56.080
 I don't know what the rules of the debate are, to actually nail him to the wall,

1:34:56.720 --> 1:35:00.320
 it might actually, I'm sure he's going to have a lot of lines too. The problem is Trump is the

1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:05.600
 master counterpuncher. So when Hillary had her line, she's like, well, it's a good thing

1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:09.760
 that Donald Trump isn't in charge of our legal system. And he's like, yeah, you'd be in jail.

1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:16.560
 It's like, oh, lady, you set him up. That's painful to watch those debates.

1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:21.280
 I mean, there's something, I think it's actually analogous. Come to think of it,

1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:28.000
 your conversation with me right now. Sleepy Joe, I'm playing the role of Sleepy Joe.

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:39.440
 So I actually connect to Joe because there's like these weird pauses that I do the same,

1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:45.600
 I do the same thing. And I noise a shit out of me that like, in mid sentence, I'll start saying

1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:54.880
 a different thing and take a tangent. I'm not as slow and drunk as I sound always. I swear

1:35:54.880 --> 1:36:01.040
 I'm more intelligent underneath. I'm slower but less drunk. Exactly. But the result,

1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:09.040
 one of those is true, but not both. Yeah. And Trump just like you are a master counterpuncher.

1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:15.200
 So it's gonna be messy. Here's the other thing in all seriousness. Chris Wallace is the moderator.

1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:21.280
 Chris Wallace has interviewed Trump several times and he was a tough, tough questioner.

1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:26.560
 So I don't think he's gonna come in there with softball questions. I think he's really going

1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:31.920
 to try to nail Trump down, which is tough to do. I like him a lot. And he's like,

1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:35.120
 Mr. President, sir, that's not accurate, blah, blah, blah. He's done it. And Trump gets very

1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:39.680
 frustrated because he doesn't just let him say whatever he wants and he hits him with the follow

1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:47.120
 up. I guess he's on Fox News and I listened to his Sunday program every once in a while.

1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:52.880
 I don't know. He gives me hope that I don't know. There's something in the voice like

1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:57.120
 that he's not bought. There's no question he's gonna take this seriously,

1:36:57.120 --> 1:36:59.280
 which I think is the best you could hope for in a moderator.

1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:05.600
 Like it feels like there's people that might actually take the mainstream media into a place

1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:10.560
 that's going to be better in the future and like we need people like him. You mean like Robespierre?

1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:14.880
 What do you mean? Like taking the mainstream media to a better future, like bring out the

1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:21.840
 guillotines. Okay. So you put your anarchist hat back on. I don't think Robespierre is much

1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:24.960
 of an anarchist, but yeah, I get what you're saying. Yeah. You don't think there should be

1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:31.840
 a centralized place for news? There isn't now. Well, that's what mainstream media is supposed

1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:37.520
 to represent and broken. Well, it's not whatever, what would you call that? That a place where

1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:45.200
 people traditionally said was like the legitimate source of truth. No, that's what the media was

1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:51.920
 supposed to represent. That's their big branding accomplishment. That was never true. Yeah,

1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:56.480
 because if you, here's what happens. We remember the Spanish American war, remember the main,

1:37:56.480 --> 1:38:01.840
 we have to take Cuba, yellow journalism, Wally Randolph Hearst, right? Then record scratch,

1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:06.320
 and then we're all objective. Like when did this transition happen according to people?

1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:11.520
 When you were saying that the Kaiser is the worst human being on earth, when you were downplaying

1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:16.160
 Stalin and downplaying Hitler's atrocities, when you were saying we had to be in Vietnam,

1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:21.520
 at what point, WMDs, when did it change? It never changed. You just are better con artists at a

1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:27.440
 certain point and now the mask is dropping. Yeah, but don't you think there's, at its best, like

1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:38.960
 investigative journalism can uncover truth in a way that like Reddit, subreddits can't.

1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:43.120
 You know Reddit? Sure, I agree. At its best, absolutely. That's not even dispute.

1:38:43.680 --> 1:38:50.320
 But like, don't you think like fake it until you make it is the right way to do it? Meaning like,

1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:59.760
 make the news? No, no. I meant the news saying like we dream of doing, of arriving at the truth

1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:03.680
 and reporting the truth. They don't say that. CNN had an advertisement that said,

1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:09.840
 this is an apple. We only report facts. That's a lie. No, that's now. And now it's clear things

1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:14.640
 have changed. They haven't changed. You just more, you're more aware of the chicanery.

1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:21.200
 How many people died in Iraq? Because Saddam Hussein was about to launch WMDs.

1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:27.920
 Who had consequences for this? No one. This isn't a minor thing. This is lots of dead people.

1:39:29.920 --> 1:39:36.400
 And also, I mean, dead people is horrible, but also the money, which has, like we said,

1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:40.080
 economic effects. Marion Williamson, I think it was, had the, or Trump,

1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:43.040
 both of them had the great point that goes, it's like a trillion dollars. How many schools

1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:46.480
 would that build? How many roads would that build? Even here? Why are we building hospitals in

1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:50.320
 Iraq that we destroyed when we could building hospitals here? It makes no sense. It's horrifying.

1:39:51.680 --> 1:39:55.280
 So who's responsible for that? Like who? Alex Jones.

1:39:56.880 --> 1:40:05.840
 No, I meant for, well, so who's responsible for arriving at the truth of that, of speaking to

1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:11.600
 the money spent on wars in Iraq? This is one of the great things about social media.

1:40:11.600 --> 1:40:14.320
 Twitter. You have faith in Twitter. Not just, not specific to Twitter,

1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:17.600
 but yeah, social media is the whole, what anyone could, here's a great, another great example.

1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:24.800
 Before, if you were talking about police brutality or these riots, you would have to perceive it in

1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:29.600
 the way it was framed and presented to, Nicholas Sandman is another example, Breonna Taylor,

1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:33.280
 all these things. Well, we don't have footage of her. You would have to perceive in the way

1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:38.160
 that it's edited and presented to you by the corporate press. Now everyone has a video camera,

1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:42.640
 everyone has their perspective, and it's very useful when these incidents happen,

1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:46.160
 where you could see the same incident from several angles and you don't need

1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:50.000
 Don Lemon or Chris Wallace to tell me what this means. I can see with my own eyes.

1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:57.600
 Yeah, I've been very pleasantly surprised about the power. See, like people, the mob again gets in

1:40:57.600 --> 1:41:04.320
 the way, they get emotional and they destroy like the, the ability for people to reason,

1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:11.280
 but you're right, that truth is unobstructed on social media. Like if you're, if you're careful

1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:17.520
 and patient, you can see the truth. Like for example, data on COVID, some of the best sources

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:23.040
 are doctors. Like if you want to know the truth about the coronavirus, what's happening

1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:29.040
 is there's follow people on Twitter. There's certain people that are just like sourcing them

1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:35.840
 for me versus the CDC and the WHO. That's fast. I mean, it's, well, it's kind of anarchy, right?

1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:41.920
 Yes, it is. It's not kind of, it is anarchy. Yes. I mean, well, there's some censorship and all

1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:44.800
 that kind of stuff. You have censorship under anarchy in the sense that you're talking about.

1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:49.920
 Like people be kicked off of Twitter. That's a drawing. How do you kick somebody? Okay. So,

1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:56.560
 I mean, it's a private company. Private company. Most people wouldn't say Twitter is working,

1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:01.200
 but that's probably because they take for granted how well it's working. And they're just complaining

1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:09.120
 about the small part of it that's broken. Right. Yeah. Okay. Another question about.

1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:17.120
 You feel better? No. By the way, I mean, I had a personal gripe with the situation about the,

1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:26.080
 not a personal gripe, but I felt overly emotional about the possibility that there

1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:32.880
 would be some of Donald Trump messing with the election process. But you made me feel better.

1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:41.120
 Good. Saying like, if he had a bunch of opportunities to do what, like to do what I would have done

1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:47.920
 if I was a dictator, I would, the first time those rides over George Floyd, I would instituted

1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:54.400
 martial law. Do you know what I remember very vividly is after 9 11, and everyone was waiting

1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:58.880
 for George Bush to give his speech and he had 98% approved rating. And I remember very vividly,

1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:03.680
 because if he had said, we're suspending the constitution, everyone would have cheered for

1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:09.120
 him. Like he couldn't get enough support at that time and he didn't do it. And I can't say anything

1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:14.080
 really good about George W. Bush. I'm not a fan of his to say the least. So I think you and I,

1:43:14.080 --> 1:43:18.560
 and you know, other people who are familiar with, you know, totalitarian regimes to some extent,

1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:25.280
 from our ancestry, whatever, from research should always be the ones freaking out and warning. But

1:43:25.280 --> 1:43:31.920
 we should also be aware of, we got a ways to go before it's Hitler. And thankfully,

1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:36.720
 there are a lot of dominoes that have to fall into place before Hitler. It's like the game

1:43:36.720 --> 1:43:42.880
 Secret Hitler. It's a board game before Hitler becomes Hitler. Like it's not, especially in America,

1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:47.680
 there's lots of things that have to happen before you really get to that point. I mean,

1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:52.560
 FDR was for all intents and purposes, a dictator. But even then, the worst you could say, and this

1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:56.640
 is not something that you should take lightly, was internment of Japanese citizens, but they

1:43:56.640 --> 1:44:01.760
 weren't murdered. They weren't, you know, you know, under lock and key in the sense of like in cells.

1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:06.080
 So things could have gotten a lot worse for him. We have to, I mean, Hitler is such a horrible

1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:13.440
 person to bring up because Mussolini is better because Hitler is so closely connected to the

1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:18.160
 atrocities of the Holocaust. There's all the stuff that led up to the war in the war itself. Say

1:44:18.160 --> 1:44:24.320
 that there was no Holocaust. Hitler will probably be viewed differently. Yes, I should think so.

1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:30.000
 You think that's a very controversial stance. You think Hitler would be viewed differently

1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:39.280
 if it wasn't for the Holocaust? Well, I mean, but it's a funny thing that the, I would say,

1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:46.240
 the death of how many, 40, 50 million, I mean, I don't know how you calculate it,

1:44:46.800 --> 1:44:52.880
 is not seen as bad as the 6 million. Oh yeah, because of Mao and Stalin. Yeah.

1:44:54.800 --> 1:44:58.800
 But it's interesting. I'm working on it. You're working on it. Yeah, the next book I'm talking

1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:03.600
 about. Remind me, well, it's good. I'm glad a good writer is because I'm almost not reminded.

1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:06.640
 My last book, The New Right, you know, I had to deal with some like the Nazis. And one of the

1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:09.760
 points they make is how come everyone knows about the Holocaust, but no one knows about the Hall

1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:14.480
 of the Moor. And they're right. We should know about this because it is a great example of both

1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:20.640
 how the Western media were depraved, but also what human beings are capable of. And those scars

1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:25.360
 are still, you know, many Americans think Russian, Ukraine are the same thing. You know, that like,

1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:28.480
 oh, Trump's in debt with the Ukrainians, Trump's about the Russians, they think it's the same thing.

1:45:29.280 --> 1:45:34.400
 For us, it's complete lunacy. But this is the kind of thing where Pol Pot is another example,

1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:39.840
 where people have no clue of what has been done to their fellow man in the face of this earth,

1:45:39.840 --> 1:45:44.560
 and they should know. How much of that do you lay at the hands of communism? How much are you with

1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:52.240
 like a Jordan Pearson, who has is intricately connecting the atrocities, like, like you're

1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:58.240
 saying 1930s, Ukraine, where people were starved. I recently, my grandmother recently passed away,

1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:07.600
 and she survived that as a kid, which is, those people, I mean, just they're tough.

1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:14.400
 They're tough. Like that whole region is tough, because they survived that. And then right after

1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:24.960
 the occupation of Nazis, Germans. How much do you lay that at communism as an ideology versus

1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:31.040
 Stalin the man? I think, you know, Lenin was building concentration camps, you know, while

1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:37.600
 he was around, and slave labor. I don't, I think it's clearly both. There are certain variants

1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:43.840
 of communism that were far like Khrushchev, you know, and Gorbachev, the reason the Soviet Union

1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:47.600
 fell apart. And this is kind of, I'm going to spoil the end of the book. There's an amazing book

1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:51.600
 called Revolution 1989. It's like most people, the book of her read by Victor Sebastian, he's a

1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:57.680
 Hungarian author. And basically what happens in 1989, Poland has their elections. And then in 1990,

1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:02.720
 they kind of led in the labor people to the government. And people start crossing borders,

1:47:02.720 --> 1:47:07.840
 you know, in the Eastern Bloc. And you had Hanukkah from Eastern Germany, and Chachesko from Romania,

1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:12.400
 Colin Gorbachev, because those are the two toughest ones by communist standards. They go,

1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:17.040
 they're just escaping. We're going to lose everything. You got to send in the tanks,

1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:21.200
 like you did in Hungary, like you did in Czech Republic, Czechoslovakian 68. And Gorbachev goes,

1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:25.680
 I'm not sending the tanks. And they go, dude, if you don't send in the tanks, it's all done. And

1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:31.280
 he goes, nope, I'm not that kind of guy. And they were right. I mean, Khrushchev was personally

1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:36.560
 shot with his wife up against the wall. Hanukkah, I forgot what happened to him. But they all

1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:41.520
 self liberated my friend who was born in Czechoslovakia. His mom was pregnant, you know, under

1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:46.080
 communism. And she never even imagined he'd be free. And he was born under free. And they were

1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:49.760
 all looking around all these countries that self liberated. Because they're like, this is a trick,

1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:53.360
 right? They're just, they're trying to figure out who's like not good, so that they can arrest us

1:47:53.360 --> 1:48:01.680
 en masse and they didn't. So there, even within communism, there are bad guys and better guys.

1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:06.560
 But we talked about anarchy. We talked about democracy. Do you see

1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:14.480
 like there's democratic socialism conversations going on in the popular culture socialism is seen

1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:22.560
 as like evil or for some people great? Sure. What, like, what are your thoughts about is

1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:29.520
 in a political ideology? Evil. So you're on the evil side. Yes. Fundamentally. Yes. What, what,

1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:36.240
 what is it? You know, what, yeah, what, what makes it evil? What's like structurally,

1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:41.520
 if you were to try to analyze what? Sure, this, I say three ways. Morally, no person has the right

1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:47.360
 to tell another person how to live their life. Economically, it's not possible to make calculations

1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:52.160
 under socialism. It's only the price, the prices that are information that tells me, oh, this is,

1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:56.320
 we need to produce more of this, we need to produce less of this, without prices being able to adjust

1:48:56.320 --> 1:49:01.840
 and give information to producers and, and, and consumers, you have no way of being able to produce

1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:08.800
 effectively or efficiently. And also it is, it turns people against each other when you force

1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:12.400
 people to interact, when you force them into relationships, when you force them into jobs,

1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:17.040
 and you don't give them any choice when there's a monopoly, the consequence of monopoly,

1:49:17.040 --> 1:49:20.640
 everyone's familiar with ostensibly under capitalism, but somehow when it's a government

1:49:20.640 --> 1:49:24.160
 monopoly, all those economic principles don't work, that doesn't make any sense.

1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:28.960
 But there's force in democracy too. It's just you're, you're saying there's a bit more force

1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:34.720
 in, in socialism. Yeah. But that's interesting that you say that there's not enough information.

1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:40.160
 I mean, that's ultimately, you need to have really good data. Yes.

1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:45.440
 To achieve the goals of the system, even, even if there's no corruption. Right.

1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:48.080
 You just need to have the information. Right. Which you can't.

1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:55.600
 And capitalism provides you, like really strong. Real time. Real time information.

1:49:56.720 --> 1:50:03.600
 That, and if like capitalism at its best and cleanest, which is like perfect

1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:07.200
 information is available. There's no manipulation of information.

1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:10.160
 That's what, you know, that's one of the problems. Okay.

1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:16.160
 Can we talk about some candidates, the ones we got and possible alternatives?

1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:25.040
 So one question I have is why do we have within the system, why do we have the candidates we have?

1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:35.520
 Is, it seems, maybe you can correct me, highly unsatisfactory. Like the, like,

1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:38.640
 is anyone actually excited about our current candidates?

1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:44.320
 I'm kind of excited because no matter who wins the election, it's going to be hilarious.

1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:47.680
 So that is something that I'm excited about. From a, from a human perspective.

1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:52.480
 Yeah. Is that, is that what the whole system is? So that's one theory of the case is the

1:50:52.480 --> 1:51:00.000
 entire thing is optimized for viewership and excitement by definitions of like the reality

1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:05.840
 show kind of excitement. I think it is, if you look at what happened with Brett Kavanaugh,

1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:14.960
 this is not a career that would draw people who are, you might say, quality. Because no

1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:20.000
 matter who they are, there would be a huge incentive from the other team to denigrate

1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:25.040
 them and humiliate them in the worst possible ways. Because as the two teams lose their legitimacy

1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:30.000
 among Gen Pop, it's going to get harder and harder for them to maintain any kind of claims to

1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:34.320
 authority, which is something I like, but which does kind of play out in, you know,

1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:39.360
 certain nefarious ways. So people, the best of the best are not going to want to be politicians?

1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:44.160
 Yeah, because I could have a job, where I have a job interview and I'm running

1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:50.160
 Yahoo or whatever, or I could for 18 months have to eat, you know, corn dogs looking like

1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:56.400
 I'm going down on someone and shake hands and have all this, my family and on social media daily

1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:00.640
 call the worst things for what? And then I'm still not guaranteed the position.

1:52:01.920 --> 1:52:06.800
 But the flip side of that, like from my perspective is the competition is weak.

1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:15.280
 Meaning, like, you need a minimum amount of eloquence, clearly, that I don't,

1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:19.040
 the bar which I did not pass. I don't think either of them would be

1:52:19.040 --> 1:52:23.440
 considerably eloquent, Biden or Trump. No, I know. But that's what I'm saying. The competition,

1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:29.360
 like if you were wanting to become a politician, if you wanted to run for president,

1:52:30.160 --> 1:52:34.320
 the opportunity is there. Like if you were at all competent. Like if you had,

1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:39.520
 so like Andrew Yang is an example of somebody who has a bunch of ideas is somewhat eloquent,

1:52:41.600 --> 1:52:45.920
 like young, energetic, it feels like there should be thousands of Andrew Yang's

1:52:47.040 --> 1:52:50.000
 like that would enter the domain and he went nowhere.

1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:55.920
 Well, he, well, I wouldn't say he went nowhere. He generated quite a bit of excitement. He just

1:52:55.920 --> 1:53:01.760
 didn't go very far. That's okay. You don't have to run for president to generate excitement with

1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:04.080
 your ideas. You could be a podcast host. I'm not even joking.

1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:09.680
 That's right. That's right. That's right. And he's both Andrew Yang.

1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:10.720
 Oh, he's a podcast?

1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:13.360
 Yeah. He has a podcast called Yang Speaks.

1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:14.320
 Oh, okay. Cool.

1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:26.160
 Oh, wow. The music of the way you said, yeah, cool, is the way my mom talks to me when I tell

1:53:26.160 --> 1:53:32.560
 her something exciting going on in my life. Oh, that's nice, honey.

1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:34.000
 Oh, you made a robot. Oh, that's cool.

1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:36.480
 That makes coffee?

1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:38.320
 Oh, you're still single though, aren't you?

1:53:40.880 --> 1:53:42.960
 I wonder why. I wonder why.

1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:45.920
 Can I make you some robot wine? Give me some robot grandchildren.

1:53:49.040 --> 1:53:55.840
 Okay. But first of all, okay, let me ask you about Andrew Yang because he represents

1:53:55.840 --> 1:54:03.760
 fresh energy. You don't find him fresh or energetic. Is there any candidate you wish

1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:11.200
 was in the mix that was in the mix you wish was one of the last two remaining?

1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:16.400
 Yeah. People like Marion Williamson, I thought was great. Tulsi, I thought was great.

1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:23.040
 Amy Klobuchar got a bad rap. I think she held her own. Smart. She wasn't particularly funny.

1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:26.080
 That's okay. I think she was not threatening to a lot of people.

1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:27.360
 What did you like about them?

1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:30.640
 I guess it's named all women. That's interesting. It wasn't even intentional.

1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:35.680
 Tulsi, I like that she was aggressive, has a good resume, and is not

1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:41.520
 staying the course for the establishment. Marion Williamson, I like because she comes

1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:47.040
 from a place from what it seems of genuine compassion. Maybe she's a sociopath, I don't know.

1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:52.320
 I read her book and it actually affected me profoundly because it's very rare when you read

1:54:52.320 --> 1:54:56.400
 a book and there's even that one idea that blows your mind and that you kind of think about all

1:54:56.400 --> 1:55:01.440
 the time. There was one such idea in her book about she was teaching something called A Course

1:55:01.440 --> 1:55:05.600
 in Miracles in Hollywood. I think she still teaches it. This was during the 80s to hide the

1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:12.240
 AIDS crisis. All these young men in the prime of their life were dropping like flies. She's

1:55:12.240 --> 1:55:16.800
 trying to give them hope. Well, good luck. They're dying. No one cares. They're like,

1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:21.920
 you can't tell us that they're going to cure this. That's a lie. She goes,

1:55:21.920 --> 1:55:28.000
 what if I told you they're not going to cure it? What if I told you it's going to be to diabetes?

1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:32.240
 They cut off your foot and you're going to go blind. Would that be something that you can

1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:35.680
 hope for? When you put it like that, it's like, yeah. If you're talking to them, it's like a

1:55:35.680 --> 1:55:39.200
 homeless junkie and you're like, you could be a doctor. You're a lawyer. You're a lawyer.

1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:45.120
 Cool story. You could have a studio apartment with a terrible roommate and a shitty job,

1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:51.600
 but when you're on the street cooking breakfast in a teaspoon and you hear that, you're like,

1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:56.160
 would that really be so bad? Is that really so much worse than this? No. And it becomes something.

1:55:56.160 --> 1:56:01.600
 So when she put it in those terms, I'm like, wow, this woman that really did a number on me

1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:08.000
 in terms of teaching people how to be hopeful. Small steps. But it's also then it becomes less of

1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:13.360
 I need a miracle to be like, oh, this is really manageable. Yeah. And it's absurd to think it's

1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:22.240
 impossible. What about what's your take on you the 2020 that Brett Weinstein pushed forward?

1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:28.560
 It was DOA. He couldn't even send up to Twitter. Dead on arrival. He couldn't even send up to

1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:31.920
 Twitter, let alone or to Facebook, they got blocked, let alone to the internet. It was not

1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:37.120
 hugely problematic, by the way, that Twitter would block that. Not at all. I don't know why

1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:41.600
 they blocked it, but I believe, I don't know, problematic means that's a word that does a lot

1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:48.480
 of work that people wanted to do conceptually. The idea that unity is like taking the rejects

1:56:48.480 --> 1:56:52.400
 from each party and we're going to have something that no one likes and therefore it's going to

1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:57.680
 be a compromise is absurd. The last time we had this kind of unity ticket was the Civil War,

1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:02.000
 where you had Andrew Johnson from the Democrats and Lincoln from the Republicans. This was not

1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.760
 something that ended well, particularly nicely for both halves of the country.

1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:11.680
 So that's the way you see it. The way I saw it, I guess I haven't looked carefully at it. I haven't

1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:18.080
 either, to be fair. The way I saw it is emphasizing centrists, which is... How is Tulsi a centrist?

1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:22.800
 Tulsi was involved? Yes, he's trying to push Tulsi and Jesse Ventura or something.

1:57:24.160 --> 1:57:28.240
 So, okay, I don't know. I don't know the specifics. As a scientist, you also know

1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:34.160
 centrism is not a coherent term in politics. No, but see now you're like, what is it,

1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:40.080
 pleading to authority and my ego? No, no, I'm pleading to how you approach data.

1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:44.800
 If someone is saying the mean is accurate, that only mean... I mean, the mean could be anywhere.

1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:48.400
 It's a function of what's around it. That mean is true. I don't even know what

1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:55.040
 centrists are supposed to mean, but what it means to me, there's no idea. A centrist,

1:57:55.040 --> 1:58:00.960
 there's more of a center right or center left. To me, what that means is somebody who is

1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:13.040
 a liberal or conservative, but is open minded and empathetic to the other side.

1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:18.640
 Joe Biden had the crime bill. Joe Biden voted for Republican Supreme Court justices. Joe Biden

1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:22.560
 voted for a balanced budget. Joe Biden voted for Bush's war. And I'm sure probably I haven't

1:58:22.560 --> 1:58:25.840
 looked this up the Patriot Act. Joe, if you want a centrist, you have Joe Biden.

1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:28.160
 Yeah, okay. He's worked very well with the Republicans.

1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:32.560
 That argument could be made. Of course, everybody will always resist that argument.

1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:40.480
 It's indeniable. In fact, during the campaign, some activist started yelling at him at a town

1:58:40.480 --> 1:58:45.520
 hall, not yelling, just saying, hey, we need open borders. Joe Biden says, I'm not for open borders.

1:58:45.520 --> 1:58:50.160
 Go vote for Trump and literally turn his back on the man. And this is during the primaries where

1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:55.120
 it would be who of you to try to appeal to the base. And of course, you can probably also make

1:58:55.120 --> 1:59:02.720
 the argument that Donald Trump is center right if not center left. Well, I mean, he's very unique as

1:59:02.720 --> 1:59:07.200
 a personality. But if you look at his record and his first name is rhetoric, you can say is not

1:59:07.200 --> 1:59:13.280
 centrist at all. But in terms of how he governs the budgeting, I mean, has been very moderate.

1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:17.280
 It certainly hasn't been like draconian budget cuts. The Supreme Court, you could say, okay,

1:59:17.280 --> 1:59:21.520
 he's hard right. Immigration, you could say in certain capacities, he's hard right. But in terms

1:59:21.520 --> 1:59:27.280
 of pro life, what has he done there in terms of, you know, so it's in many other aspects,

1:59:27.280 --> 1:59:31.440
 he's been very much this kind of me too, Republican, but certainly the rhetoric,

1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:34.320
 it's very hard to make in the case that he's a centrist. So you don't like,

1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:41.440
 is there any other idea you find compelling? Like what I like about UND 2020, is this an idea

1:59:42.880 --> 1:59:48.880
 for a different way for like a different party, a different path forward. So ideas,

1:59:48.880 --> 1:59:53.360
 just like anarchy, is an interesting idea that leads to discourse that leads to...

1:59:53.360 --> 1:59:55.840
 I don't think it's interesting at all. And here's why I don't think it's interesting.

1:59:56.480 --> 2:00:02.080
 Sweden has eight parties in its parliament, Iceland, population is like 150,000. They've

2:00:02.080 --> 2:00:08.640
 got nine, I think it was Czech Republic has nine, Britain has five. So the claim that two parties

2:00:08.640 --> 2:00:15.120
 is the sensorious of speech, but three, oh, now all of a sudden, it makes no sense,

2:00:15.120 --> 2:00:19.440
 doesn't port to the data, number one. Number two is Donald Trump demonstrated that you can be

2:00:19.440 --> 2:00:24.480
 basically a third party candidate, seize the machinery of an existing party and appropriate

2:00:24.480 --> 2:00:28.400
 to your own ends, as Bernie Sanders almost did. Bernie Sanders has never been a Democrat,

2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:32.880
 major credit to him for that's not easy to be elected as Sanders and independent,

2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:38.320
 he's done it repeatedly. So these are two examples of ossified elites right for the picking. So to

2:00:38.320 --> 2:00:45.600
 have a third party makes no real sense. Speaking of which, party you talk about quite a bit.

2:00:48.720 --> 2:00:55.360
 And this is a personal challenge to you. Let me bring up the libertarian party.

2:00:55.360 --> 2:00:59.680
 And the personal challenge is to go five minutes without mocking them

2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:10.400
 in discussing this idea. So first of all, what? I'm being trolled. Okay, I'm being trolled.

2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:15.280
 Yeah, I'm being trolled. Okay, good. Do you remember the Fun Friends? There was an episode

2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:19.920
 where Chandler had to not make fun of people like, can you go one day, Chandler? And Phoebe

2:01:19.920 --> 2:01:26.160
 starts telling him about like this UFO she saw. And he's like, that's very interesting. Nice for you.

2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:32.080
 This is exactly that. Okay, so a true master would be able to play within the game within

2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:37.920
 the constraints. So no, I'm pretty sure you'll still mock them. But no, no, I'll stick to the

2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:42.560
 rules five minutes easy. So first of all, speaking broadly about libertarianism,

2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:46.800
 can you speak to that, how you feel about it? And then also to the libertarian party,

2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:53.600
 which is the implementation of it in our current system. So I think libertarianism is a great idea.

2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:58.480
 And I think there's many libertarian ideas that have become much more mainstream, which I'm very,

2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:03.760
 very happy about. I remember there was an article in either New York or New Yorker magazine in the

2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:08.320
 early 90s, where they talked about the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.

2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:14.320
 And they refer to the fact that Cato was against war, and against like regulation with a wacky

2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:18.720
 consistency. Because they didn't know how to reconcile these two things. I don't remember

2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:24.800
 where the two things were, but I remember that expression, wacky consistency. And we're all

2:02:24.800 --> 2:02:30.640
 taught, and this is very much before the internet, that there's two tribes. And if you're pro life,

2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:36.960
 you have to hate gays. And if you're for socialized medicine, that also means you have to be for

2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:44.720
 free speech. And there's a whole menu, and you got to sign into all of them. And that menu's

2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:49.040
 terrible. They hate America, they want to destroy it. Oh my God, those are horrible evil. This is

2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:53.600
 the menu you want. And the libertarian party, to some extent, and just libertarians as a whole,

2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:58.800
 said, you know, you can do the Chinese buffet and take a little from column A, a little from column B,

2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:07.440
 and have an ideology that is coherent and consistent, an ideology of peace and nonaggression

2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:14.160
 and things like that. The libertarian party takes its model from like the early progressive and

2:03:14.160 --> 2:03:19.520
 populist parties from the early 20th century, which were not very effective in terms of getting

2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:25.280
 people elected, but were extremely effective in terms of getting the two major parties to

2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:29.680
 appropriate and adopt their ideas and implement them. And in Britain as well, the liberal party

2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:35.760
 got destroyed and became taken over by labor as the alternative party to the Tories, and have those

2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:41.760
 ideas basically become mainstreamed. So I think that and the libertarian, my friend who passed away,

2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:46.800
 Eric, I miss him dearly, was their webmaster. And his whole point is, if you don't think of it in

2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:50.720
 terms of party in terms of getting people elected, but if you think of it as a party in terms of

2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:56.080
 getting people educated about alternatives, then there's enormous use for that. That was his

2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:00.000
 perspective. And I don't think that's an absurd perspective. But here's some libertarian ideas

2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:05.520
 that have become extremely mainstream. War should be a last resort. This is something we've taught

2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:10.240
 as kids and we all say, but for many years, it's been like, they don't think of it as a last resort.

2:04:10.240 --> 2:04:14.000
 It's like something's bad. Well, it's like the first instinct. Now it's like, let's really

2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:17.920
 give it a week, just a week, like what's going on in Syria. Is there really going to be a genocide,

2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:21.920
 the Kurds, you know, things like that. So that's one. Another thing is drug legalization.

2:04:22.720 --> 2:04:27.120
 This was, you know, when you and I were kids, oh, it's crazy. It's only hippies want to smoke pot.

2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:33.840
 Now it's like, with it, I was on a grand jury. And the point people make is, are you sure that

2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:40.160
 this 16 year old who's selling weed, let's say selling, should his life be ruined? Should he be

2:04:40.160 --> 2:04:46.240
 imprisoned with rapists and murderers? Like if you say yes, say yes, but you, but are you,

2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:49.920
 you have to acknowledge that that's what you're meaning. And then a lot of people are like,

2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:54.560
 wait a minute, there's got to be a third option. Then he has no consequences or he's imprisoned

2:04:54.560 --> 2:04:59.200
 with a rapist. Like I'm not comfortable with either of these. And I think the other one is

2:04:59.200 --> 2:05:04.160
 a increasing skepticism. This libertarians run top of this first and the hard left of the police.

2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:09.600
 As of now, asset forfeiture steals more from people than burglaries. What people don't know

2:05:09.600 --> 2:05:14.080
 about what asset forfeiture is, if the cops come to your house and they suspect you, you haven't

2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:20.800
 been convicted of using your car or your house or whatever in terms of selling drugs, they can take

2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:26.160
 whatever they want. And then you have to sue to prove your innocence and get your property back.

2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:29.920
 It's a complete violation of due process. People don't realize this is going on. It's a great way

2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:35.120
 for the cops to increase their budgets and it's legal. And libertarians were like the first big

2:05:35.120 --> 2:05:39.280
 one saying, guys, this is not American and this is crazy. And now increasingly people

2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:43.680
 on conservatives and leftists like, wait a minute, this, this is, even if you are selling drugs,

2:05:43.680 --> 2:05:48.160
 like they take your house, what are you talking about? So I think those are some mechanisms

2:05:48.160 --> 2:05:52.400
 that libertarianism, though, but not by name, has become far more popular.

2:05:52.400 --> 2:05:59.600
 Yeah, that's interesting. So the idea, yeah, a coherence set of ideas that eventually get

2:05:59.600 --> 2:06:03.440
 integrated into a two party system. Yeah. The war, that's an interesting one. You're right.

2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:10.720
 I would want, I wonder what the thread there is. I wonder how it connects to 9 11 and so on.

2:06:10.720 --> 2:06:16.080
 But I think that I think the Patriot Act, Patriot Act, for people who are politically savvy,

2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:23.360
 we're like, oh, okay, this is not a joke. This is really a crazy infringement or freedoms.

2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:28.960
 And both parties are falling over each other to sign into law and the Orwellian name.

2:06:29.600 --> 2:06:33.200
 You don't want to, how can you be against patriotism? What kind of person? You know what I mean? So

2:06:33.200 --> 2:06:37.040
 that, I think for a lot of people, especially both civil libertarians on the left and a lot of

2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:41.040
 conservatives who are constitutionalists are like, wait a minute, this isn't, I'm not comfortable

2:06:41.040 --> 2:06:44.400
 with this. And I'm also not comfortable with how comfortable everyone in Washington is with it.

2:06:44.400 --> 2:06:51.920
 You're right. Probably libertarians and libertarianism is a place of ideas,

2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:59.360
 which is why I have a connection to it. I like the, every time I listen to those folks, I like

2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:03.920
 them. I feel connected to them. I would even sometimes, depending on the day, call myself a

2:07:03.920 --> 2:07:07.600
 libertarian. But we're all in the spectrum. So that's why we're all in the spectrum. Yeah.

2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:11.280
 But like, when I look at the people that actually rise to the top

2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:17.280
 in terms of like the people who represent the party, this is where like five minutes right out,

2:07:17.280 --> 2:07:26.160
 right? I could go. I'm allowed. You can go. Why are they so weird? Why aren't strong candidates

2:07:26.160 --> 2:07:35.280
 emerging that represent as political, like representatives, or as like famous speakers,

2:07:35.280 --> 2:07:40.560
 like that represent the ideology? I think libertarians tend to be, I think

2:07:40.560 --> 2:07:44.640
 John Hite in his book, in his research, he's a political scientist. And he does a lot of

2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:47.840
 things about how people come to their political conclusions and what factors

2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:53.600
 force people to reach conclusions. And he found that libertarians are the least empathetic and

2:07:53.600 --> 2:07:58.000
 most rationalistic of all the groups. And by that, he means like they think in terms of logic,

2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:01.760
 as opposed to like people's feelings. And that has positives and has negatives.

2:08:01.760 --> 2:08:10.080
 And we have the A.B. testing with Ron Paul. Ron Paul ran for president as a libertarian

2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:15.360
 nominee. He was the nominee. He got pretty much nowhere in 1998. Then he ran as a return to

2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:20.640
 Republican Party as a congressman for many years from Texas. He ran for the presidency in 2008

2:08:20.640 --> 2:08:28.400
 and 2012. And in 2008, he stood on stage with Rudy Giuliani and told him that they were here

2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:34.240
 in 9.11 because we're over there, which would have been a shocking, horrifying taboo a few years

2:08:34.240 --> 2:08:38.640
 earlier. Many people were like, holy crap, this is amazing. Giuliani was all offended. And Ron

2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:44.640
 Paul's like, I took some guts by the way. I did. And I heard that it was so refreshing that not

2:08:44.640 --> 2:08:50.560
 what he said, but the fact that he said something that took guts. It made me realize how rare it is

2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:55.840
 for people, for politicians, but even people to say something that takes guts.

2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:01.920
 Well, it's also the idea that you can't, even if you think America has a right to invade any

2:09:01.920 --> 2:09:07.040
 country on earth as much as it wants and kill people as a consequence of war and blow up their

2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:13.680
 buildings and destroy their country, you can't with a straight face not expect us to have consequences,

2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:17.680
 even if they're consequence from evil people. Even if we're 100% the good guys and they're

2:09:17.680 --> 2:09:21.520
 100% the bad guys, those bad guys, some of them are still going to try to do something.

2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:26.800
 What happens next? You know what I mean? So that kind of concept that there's any

2:09:26.800 --> 2:09:31.360
 American culpability was where America, where we are the good guys by definition,

2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:34.880
 we're not culpable to have people start thinking about, what if there's another way?

2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:39.440
 What if we're not there and then they're not here and we're kind of doing a backdoor,

2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:43.840
 we're talking so different scenarios. So the fact that he got so much more traction

2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:50.000
 as a Republican, the fact that Donald Trump, who came out of nowhere, became not only the

2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:55.520
 candidate but the president tells people, it's like getting a book deal, right? You can either go,

2:09:55.520 --> 2:10:01.760
 there's three choices. You can either self publish, mainstream publisher or independent

2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:06.720
 publisher. The independent publisher is the worst of all choices because you're not getting a big

2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:12.800
 advance. They're not going to be able to promote you a lot and they don't get the distribution.

2:10:12.800 --> 2:10:19.200
 Mainstream, I've done mainstream itself, right? With self, I don't have the cred, the respectability

2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:24.240
 of a mainstream for the cachet. Can be a New York Times bestseller. Right. It takes a lot of work,

2:10:24.240 --> 2:10:29.440
 but I get a lot more of the profit. If it looks good on the shelf and Amazon looks identical,

2:10:29.440 --> 2:10:33.360
 so on and so forth. With the mainstream, the benefits and costs are pretty much obvious to

2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:37.040
 most people. So the same thing, it's like you can either be an independent like Ross Perot

2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:42.720
 or you could be just C's when the party apparatus, which the benefits are norms there.

2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:47.440
 But in terms of going third party, I don't know the libertarian party apparatus other than maybe

2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:52.400
 some ballot access is really that efficacious. And then you're going to have a lot of baggage

2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:57.760
 because if you hear independent, Jesse Ventura, Ross Perot, you think of the person. Now you have

2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:02.800
 to define yourself and you have to defend the party. That's two bridges for most people.

2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:11.200
 Brilliantly put. Okay. Thank you. Let me speak to you because I'm speaking to Yaron Brooks and

2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:20.240
 Yaron. I like him. Yeah. So, but that another example, I was... Ask him to tell you a joke

2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:27.200
 about Ayn Rand if he can do it. So there, that's one criticism I've heard you say, which is

2:11:27.760 --> 2:11:34.160
 they're unable to speak to any weaknesses in either Ayn Rand's or Objectivist's worldview.

2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:41.760
 Yes. That's really... You put it, I know you're half joking, but that's actually a legitimate

2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:46.640
 discussion to have. I'm not joking at all. Because that's, to me, one of the criticisms

2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:52.800
 and one of the explanations why the world seems to disrespect Ayn Rand, the people that do,

2:11:53.520 --> 2:12:01.200
 is she kind of implies that her ideas are like flawless. No, she says they correspond to reality.

2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:08.720
 Yeah. Right. That's the term she uses. That... I mean, Objectivist, it's in the name. It's,

2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:14.640
 you know, it's just facts. Like, it's impossible to basically argue against because it's pretty

2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:19.200
 simple. It's just all facts. Well, that's, it's possible to argue against, but she would say

2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:23.280
 she's never met a good critic who can argue the facts at misrepresentation. And she's not

2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:27.360
 entirely wrong. She's often caricatured because she has a very extreme personality and extreme

2:12:27.360 --> 2:12:32.240
 worldview. But that, to me, I mean, some people, there's a guy named in the physics mathematics

2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:36.080
 community called Stephen Wolfram. I don't know if you're from... Wolfram Alpha? Yeah.

2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:43.120
 Okay. He has a similar style of speaking sometimes, which is like, I've created a science,

2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:49.600
 but that turns a lot of people off, like this kind of weird confidence. But he's one of my

2:12:49.600 --> 2:12:55.280
 favorite people. I think one of the most brilliant people. If you just ignore that little bit of

2:12:55.280 --> 2:13:01.120
 ego or whatever you call that, that there's some beautiful ideas in there. She's an amazing person.

2:13:01.120 --> 2:13:08.240
 And that, for me, objectivism, I'm undereducated about it, about it. I hope to be more educated,

2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:11.840
 but there's some interesting ideas that, again, just like with UFOs,

2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:16.880
 not that there's a connection between two. Don't bring that up for your own. He won't like it.

2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:24.240
 He won't. Einran's like UFOs. Oh, no, no, no. This interview is over. That's a good yarn. Okay.

2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:31.760
 But you have to be a little bit open minded. But what's your sense of objectivism? Are there

2:13:31.760 --> 2:13:37.280
 interesting ideas that are useful to you to think about? I own her copy of the first printing of

2:13:37.280 --> 2:13:41.520
 the fountain head. So that should tell you a little bit about how my affection for Ms. Rand,

2:13:41.520 --> 2:13:47.040
 how heavy that goes. Einran does not have all the answers, but she has all the questions.

2:13:47.600 --> 2:13:52.000
 So if you study Rand, you are going to be forced to think through some very basic things,

2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:56.640
 and you're going to have your eyes open very, very heavily. She was not perfect. She never claimed to

2:13:56.640 --> 2:14:01.840
 be perfect. She was asked on Donahue, is it true that according to your philosophy, you are a perfect

2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:06.880
 being? She said, I never think of myself that way. And she said, but if you ask me, do I practice

2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:14.640
 what I preach? The answer is yes, resoundingly. She's a fascinating woman. What is really interesting

2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:19.520
 about her, and this is something you'd appreciate personally, is when you read her essays, she'll

2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:24.080
 have these weird sides. And she would talk about art, and she'd be like, and this is why the US

2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:29.040
 should be the only country with nuclear weapons. And when you follow a brilliant mind making these

2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:34.240
 seemingly disparate connections, it's something I find to be just absolutely inspiring and awesome

2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:39.760
 and entertaining. I think there's lots of things about her that people like Yaron would make

2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:48.880
 uncomfortable. Well, like she, they, so objectivism, like any other philosophy has all these techniques

2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:53.200
 to kind of hand wave away things you don't want to talk about and like pretend it. So they talk

2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:57.760
 about things like having no metaphysical significance, right? So what that means is like,

2:14:57.760 --> 2:15:01.040
 well, what about this? I don't want to talk about it. Like, it doesn't matter. Like, it literally

2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:06.720
 needs a fancy philosophical term. It doesn't matter. Or they will say correctly that it's very

2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:13.200
 twisted in our culture that when we have heroes, we look for their flaws instead of looking for

2:15:13.200 --> 2:15:18.800
 their virtues. That's a hundred percent valid perspective. However, if I'm sitting here telling

2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:24.960
 you that I think this woman is a badass, and she's amazing, and she should be studied, but there's

2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:29.760
 also these idiosyncrasies. They don't want to hear it because they, and I think it's very convenient

2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:34.480
 for them because there's a lot of things she did that were, here's an example. Rand was very, very

2:15:34.480 --> 2:15:39.600
 pro, a happiness and poor pleasure. She was very pro sex, which is kind of surprising looking at

2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:44.800
 her and how she talked and how strident she was. As a result of this, she never got her cats fixed

2:15:44.800 --> 2:15:50.400
 to deny them the pleasure of orgasm. So her male cats are spraying up her entire house. Like that

2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:56.400
 is, I mean, that's her putting her philosophy into practice, but it's still gross. So that's the

2:15:56.400 --> 2:16:01.760
 kind of thing where I don't think he'd be. Another thing is Rand had an article on a woman president

2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:06.000
 and she said a woman should never be president, right? Now, when Rand says things that are too

2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:11.760
 goofy for them, they say, oh, that's not objectivism. That's her personal preference. It's like,

2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:18.000
 she did not have these lines. Objectivism was always defined as Ayn Rand's writings

2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:22.160
 plus the additional essays in her books. So if this was in part of those books,

2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:26.240
 this counts as official objectivism, but they pretend otherwise. So that's another example.

2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:31.120
 Plus they, she was, and I bet you she was on the spectrum to some extent. I'm not joking.

2:16:31.120 --> 2:16:37.520
 I'm not using that derisively. She was of the belief and not inaccurately because that humor

2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:42.800
 is used to denigrate and humiliate. And she was thinking about the John Stuart type before there

2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:49.120
 was a John Stuart. And a lot of times, like how I use mocking, but she was resentful correctly

2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:53.760
 that a lot of times people who are great and accomplished, little nobodies will make a punch

2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:58.000
 line just to bring them down and just bother her. Here's an example I just thought of.

2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:02.320
 I remember in, I don't remember when it was, it must have been the 90s. They had a segment of MTV

2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:08.720
 of all these musicians who were making their own perfumes, right? And this girl grabbed Prince's

2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:12.720
 perfume. And before she even smelled it, she had the joke ready. She just, oh, this smells almost

2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:16.880
 as bad as his music lately. It's like, first of all, I'm sure the perfume's fine. And second,

2:17:16.880 --> 2:17:21.920
 well, this is Prince. He's one of the all time greats and you can't wait to, you know, you know,

2:17:21.920 --> 2:17:28.080
 denigrate him. Like, and apart, I want to be like, like, how dare you? Like, as if, as if this perfume

2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:33.120
 in any way, in any way mitigates his amazing accomplishments and achievements, you horrible

2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:38.320
 person. But I do have some great Iron Man jokes and he would not be happy about them.

2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:43.360
 The perfume thing, the problem with this is just not funny. Not that. Oh, he sucks. Okay, great.

2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:48.640
 Not that they dared to try to be humorous. Right. Because I don't know why you mentioned John Stuart

2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:53.280
 because John Stuart is pretty, can be funny. Right. But his, he taught a generation, you

2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:59.280
 still see this on Twitter, where things have to be inherently sarcastic and snide. But isn't that,

2:17:59.280 --> 2:18:03.840
 I mean, aren't you practicing that? No, I use irony and not sarcasm. Here's an example when people,

2:18:03.840 --> 2:18:08.560
 like you say something and someone replied to be like, um, last I checked, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:12.320
 And I'll say them. I go, what do you think saying last I checked added to your point? You're giving

2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:17.840
 me valuable information and data, but you are trained to believe that it has to be couched

2:18:17.840 --> 2:18:22.160
 in this sneering. It doesn't just give me the information. This is useful information.

2:18:22.160 --> 2:18:26.880
 Yeah. That's, that's true. It's an e jerk. But see, John Stuart did it masterfully.

2:18:26.880 --> 2:18:30.720
 Correct. And they don't. And they, they don't, it's, it's like people who copy communities,

2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:37.120
 certain comedians, you try to copy them and use everything in the process of copy. Yeah.

2:18:38.720 --> 2:18:45.280
 Yep. Okay. But in terms of the, the philosophy of, you know, selfishness, this kind of

2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:52.320
 individual focused idea and I imagine that connects with you. Yes. And I think it would connect with

2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:55.920
 more people if they understood what she meant by it. Nathaniel Brandon, who was her heir until

2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:01.600
 she kind of broke with him and he was a code dedicated of Atlas shrugged said, no one will say

2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:08.400
 on Rand's views with a straight face. They won't say, I believe that my happiness matters and is

2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:13.840
 important and is worth fighting for. And that I ran says this and she's dangerous. Now it's very

2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:18.480
 easy to say this could have dangerous consequences if you're a sociopath, but to put it in those

2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:23.760
 terms, I think is extremely healthy. I think more people should want to be happy. And, and

2:19:23.760 --> 2:19:29.200
 I think a lot of us are raised to be apologetic, especially in this cynical media culture,

2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:33.280
 that if you say, I want to be happy, I want to love my life, that it's just like, okay,

2:19:33.280 --> 2:19:38.240
 sweetheart. And the eye rolling. And I think that's so pernicious and so horrifying. And this is why

2:19:38.240 --> 2:19:42.720
 I'm a Camus person because Camus thought the arch enemy was cynicism and I could not agree more.

2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:45.360
 Like if you are the kind of person, if someone likes a band and you're like, oh,

2:19:45.360 --> 2:19:49.280
 she like them, blah, blah, blah. It's like, this gives them happiness. Yeah. Now there's

2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:52.800
 certain exceptions, but if it gives you happiness, it's not for you. That's cool.

2:19:54.000 --> 2:20:00.640
 Okay, this is beautiful. I, I so agree with you on the eye rolling, but you see the best of

2:20:00.640 --> 2:20:07.280
 trolling is not the eye roll. Correct. Of course not. The best of trolling is taking down the

2:20:07.280 --> 2:20:14.640
 eye rollers. I'm going to have to think about that. Okay. Cause I kind of red bull. Yeah.

2:20:15.520 --> 2:20:17.200
 Cause I put them all. My blood type is red bull.

2:20:20.720 --> 2:20:24.720
 I kind of put them all in the same bin. Okay. And they're not, they're not, they're not.

2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:30.560
 Okay. All right. Here's another example of trolling. I was making jokes about Ron Paul. He

2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:36.240
 just had a stroke, right? And someone came at me and they're like, oh, blah, blah, blah, you know,

2:20:36.240 --> 2:20:39.760
 you're ugly. I hope you have a stroke. I hope you're in the hospital. And I just go,

2:20:39.760 --> 2:20:45.280
 I just did have a stroke on your mom's face. So they came at me and now they got put in their

2:20:45.280 --> 2:20:52.400
 place with a sub par. Um, I mean, that wasn't clever. You weren't, you weren't clever. Not

2:20:52.400 --> 2:20:57.680
 particularly. No. Well, one of your things you do, which is interesting, I mean, I give you

2:20:57.680 --> 2:21:05.040
 props in a sense is you're willing to go farther than people expect you to. Yes. That's fun.

2:21:05.040 --> 2:21:11.280
 Yeah. In fact, I'll probably edit out like half of this podcast because the thing you did, which

2:21:11.280 --> 2:21:17.520
 she kept in, I should mention, Mikaela Peterson now has a podcast, which is nice. I guess was it

2:21:17.520 --> 2:21:20.960
 on her podcast? She was on mine. She was on yours. We did both, but this is when you're

2:21:20.960 --> 2:21:25.760
 referring to when she was on mine. Yeah. She was on, yeah, right. And you went right for the,

2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:30.960
 so I'll tell you what it was. You don't have to paraphrase. So I opened up, I say,

2:21:30.960 --> 2:21:35.600
 you know, she's Jordan Peterson's dad. And as many people know, Jordan, sorry, he's her dad,

2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:41.920
 yeah. She's had a long issue with substance addiction. And I said to her, you're, you know,

2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:46.240
 you're most famous for being, you know, Jordan Peterson's daughter. You know, many people,

2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:50.160
 he's changed so many lives around the world. He's, and he's been such an enormous influence

2:21:50.160 --> 2:21:55.040
 to me personally, that I've started taking Benzo Duazepines recreationally. And she's like,

2:21:55.040 --> 2:22:01.200
 oh my God, Michael is so horrible. Yeah. You, because you pulled me in with this, because

2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:05.760
 you're taught, I mean, you know, because he's going through a rough time now, she's going through

2:22:05.760 --> 2:22:10.480
 just everything was just, you pulled me in emotionally. I was like, this is going to be

2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:18.240
 the sweet Mike is going to be just this wonderful. And then just bam. So that's, that's, that's,

2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:26.320
 that was props to you on that. It wasn't whatever that is, that is an art form when done well,

2:22:26.320 --> 2:22:32.720
 it can be taken too far. My criticism is that that feels too good for some people.

2:22:32.720 --> 2:22:36.880
 What do you mean? Oh, they're too happy being a reference because to show that they don't care.

2:22:36.880 --> 2:22:40.960
 But I think that's another form of cynicism though. Right. So I, because you think it's

2:22:40.960 --> 2:22:47.920
 possible to be a troll and still be the live life to its highest ideal in the Camus sense.

2:22:47.920 --> 2:22:56.560
 I try. That's kind of my ideal. I, I believe it's not. It becomes a drug. I feel like that takes

2:22:56.560 --> 2:23:04.080
 you like, I think love ultimately is the way to experience like every moment of every day.

2:23:04.080 --> 2:23:09.040
 You don't think that was an expression of, I honestly think, let's, let's, let's split

2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:17.040
 hairs here because I think this is something of use here. I do think that me, me being able to

2:23:17.040 --> 2:23:23.760
 make her laugh about this year of hell she was in does create an element of love and connection

2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:32.240
 between me and her. Yeah, but I know she would say that. Yes. It wasn't that. It was what you said

2:23:32.240 --> 2:23:38.800
 in combination with the sweetness everywhere else, the kindness. It's a very subtle thing,

2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:43.040
 but like, it's like some of the deepest connections we have with others is when we

2:23:43.040 --> 2:23:51.600
 like mock them lovingly or yes, correct. But like there is stuff. There's kindness around that.

2:23:51.600 --> 2:23:56.160
 Yes. Not in words, but in like, of course, subtle things because it creates an air of

2:23:56.160 --> 2:24:01.840
 familial being familial. Like we're through this together. Like, it's yeah. Yeah. That's missing.

2:24:01.840 --> 2:24:06.720
 That's very difficult to do on the internet. I agree with you. I agree with you. That's why

2:24:06.720 --> 2:24:15.840
 I might like my general approach on the internet is to be more like simple, less witty and more

2:24:15.840 --> 2:24:21.280
 like dumbly loving. But that's not your core competency being witty.

2:24:24.720 --> 2:24:29.760
 Me? Yeah. I could be witty. You can be, but I'm saying that's not your core competency. I'm

2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:35.040
 saying you're bad at it, but I'm saying that's not where you go like organically, especially with

2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:42.160
 strangers. I just feel like nobody's core competence on the internet is, uh, I guess if you want to

2:24:42.160 --> 2:24:48.320
 bring love to the world, nobody's core competence is given the current platforms, nobody's core

2:24:48.320 --> 2:24:54.880
 competence is wit. It's very difficult to be witty on the internet without, while still communicating

2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:59.360
 kindness. Like, I'll give you another example in the same way that you can in physical space.

2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:04.960
 I'll give you another example. Someone came at me and they were like, they give me a donation. People

2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:10.800
 do this all the time. And they go, oh, um, like I started reading your books because of my wife

2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:15.920
 and, you know, now watch your shows together and keep up the good work. And I go, what does her

2:25:15.920 --> 2:25:23.040
 boyfriend think? So that is an example of wit and love because that person feels seen. I'm

2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:27.680
 acknowledging them. I'm also making a joke at their expense. We know it's a joke. So I think

2:25:27.680 --> 2:25:33.040
 it's a good point. Good point. Language is often used in nonliteral ways to cue emotional and

2:25:33.040 --> 2:25:38.320
 connectivity. It's difficult, but it's very difficult. What you've done is difficult to

2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:42.800
 accomplish, but you've done it well. I mean, you do, like you did, you've been doing these live

2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:46.800
 streams, which are nice that people give you a bunch of money and donations and stuff. And then

2:25:46.800 --> 2:25:51.840
 you, you'll often like make fun of certain aspects of their questions and so on. But it's always

2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:54.400
 loving. That's not from love. That is genuine annoyance because they ask me some really dumb

2:25:54.400 --> 2:26:00.240
 questions, but they're still underlying. It's not even like there's a kind person under that.

2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:05.520
 That's being communicated. That's interesting. But I don't know if I get that from your Twitter.

2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:09.440
 I know I get that from the video. The something about the face, something about like,

2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:15.040
 yeah, of course, it's much harder with more data. The more easy it is to convey emotion and subtlety.

2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:18.800
 Absolutely. If you only have literally black and white letters, it's going to be or whatever,

2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:22.080
 white and black, if you have night mode, it's going to be a very different, it's much more

2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:26.240
 limited information. Yeah. But this is the fundamental thing is like.

2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:31.120
 Here's another example. Like if they had access to my face, like a lot of times some people

2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:35.360
 don't know who I am and they come at me, call me a Nazi anti semi, right? And I start talking

2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:39.520
 about the Jews and just how terrible the Jews are. Now, all my audience knows I'm Jewish that I went

2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:43.280
 to a Shiva. So they're sitting there laughing because this person's making ass to themselves.

2:26:43.280 --> 2:26:48.000
 That person has no idea. But if there was video, then they would be like, okay, wait a minute,

2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:53.920
 something's up. Yeah. Yeah. Something's up. I don't know. I think it's entertaining. I think

2:26:53.920 --> 2:27:00.480
 it's fun, but I just, I don't think it's scalable. And ultimately I'm trying to figure out this whole

2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:07.520
 trolling thing because I think it's really destructive. I've been the outrage mob, the

2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:13.680
 outrage mobs, the just the dynamics of Twitter has been really bothering me. Okay. And I've been

2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:20.560
 trying to figure out if we can try to build an alternative to Twitter, perhaps, or try to encourage

2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:27.040
 Twitter to be better, how to have nuanced, healthy conversations. Like the reason I talk about love

2:27:27.040 --> 2:27:32.880
 isn't just for the love's sake. It's just a good base from which to have difficult conversations.

2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:39.360
 Like that's a good starting point. Because if you start, like I would argue that the kind of

2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:45.200
 conversation you have on Twitter is fun, but it might not be a good starting point for difficult

2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:49.680
 nuanced conversation. Well, I'm not interested in having those conversations with most people.

2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:55.360
 No, I know. So I agree with you. Your point is valid. Yes. But like I'm saying, so if we were

2:27:55.360 --> 2:28:02.960
 trying to have a difficult nuanced conversation about, say, race in America or policing, is there

2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:10.000
 racism, institutional racism of policing? Okay. There's the only conversations that have been

2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:15.600
 nuanced about it that I've heard is in the podcasting medium, which is the magic of podcasting,

2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:24.080
 which is great. But that's the downside of podcasting is it's a very small number of people,

2:28:24.080 --> 2:28:29.760
 even if it's in the thousands, it's still small. And then there's millions of people on social

2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:34.240
 media and they're not having nuanced conversation at all. They're not capable of it. That's the

2:28:34.240 --> 2:28:38.240
 difference in you. They have no minds. I believe they are. There's no data that serves us. And

2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:43.200
 then both of us aren't being not scientific. You don't have data to support your world either.

2:28:43.200 --> 2:28:49.600
 You're making the claim. Well, you are too. No, I'm not. If I'm looking at an object, the claim

2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:57.360
 that it has in mind. Well, no, your claim is that people are fundamentally stupid.

2:28:57.360 --> 2:29:04.240
 We can do this. Aren't you a martial artist? Yes. How's it feel? I just judo on you.

2:29:06.640 --> 2:29:13.440
 But you really don't think people are deep down like capable of being intelligent?

2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:17.840
 No, not at all. Not deep down that surface. I'm not joking. I'm not being tongue and cheek.

2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:21.280
 I'm not being cynical. I do not at all think they have this capacity.

2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:25.040
 I'm going to think because you're being so clear about it. You're not even,

2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:30.640
 I'm going to think about that. You know why? Here's evidence for my position,

2:29:30.640 --> 2:29:34.880
 not proof. And this is, of course, data that is of little use, but it's of interest.

2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:37.920
 A lot of times when you have an audience as big as mine and people come at you,

2:29:38.720 --> 2:29:43.360
 not only will people say the same thing, the same concept, they'll say the same concept in the same

2:29:43.360 --> 2:29:50.960
 way. That is not a mind. Yeah. That surface evidence. You're saying this iceberg looks

2:29:50.960 --> 2:29:56.800
 like this from the surface. I'm saying there's an iceberg there that if challenged can

2:29:59.920 --> 2:30:06.800
 rise to the occasion of deep thinking. And you're saying, nope. Nope. It's just frozen water.

2:30:08.320 --> 2:30:14.400
 Atmarozhene. Isn't that the Russian expression? That's ice cream. No, not marozhene. Atmarozhene.

2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:19.680
 Doesn't it mean like no one's there? Actually, I don't know. Yeah, it means like, yeah.

2:30:19.680 --> 2:30:28.240
 Yeah. It's like thought. It means nikova doma. Nikova doma. Okay. Well, so you're challenging me

2:30:28.240 --> 2:30:31.920
 to be a little bit more rigorous. I think I'll try to prove. I'm not challenging you anything. I'm

2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:35.600
 just saying. No, not challenging me, but like I'm challenging myself based on what you're saying,

2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:43.280
 because I'd like to prove you wrong and find actual data to show you're wrong. And I think I can,

2:30:43.280 --> 2:30:48.640
 but I would need to get that data. That's funny you said I think I can when they were working

2:30:48.640 --> 2:30:53.440
 on my biography, ego and hubris, the title I had suggested was the little engine that could but

2:30:53.440 --> 2:31:01.280
 shouldn't. I think that's a great title. That's pretty good. Yeah. Speaking of biographies,

2:31:01.280 --> 2:31:05.440
 I mean, one, I read your book or listened to your book, listened to, there's an audio book for

2:31:05.440 --> 2:31:11.280
 you, right? Yeah, I did the audio. Yeah. Yeah. You, you read it? My goal is, yes. Okay. So this was,

2:31:11.280 --> 2:31:15.120
 this was a, I didn't do Yaron Brooks voice in the book. I did all the different voices because

2:31:15.120 --> 2:31:20.960
 he has a lisp and I didn't want to sound like I was making fun of him. Yeah. I don't remember you

2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:25.680
 reading it, but it was, I was really enjoyed it. No, okay. It was good. It was like a year, year and

2:31:25.680 --> 2:31:34.080
 a half ago. This I can prove. Well, let me at a high level see if you can pull this off. If I ask

2:31:34.080 --> 2:31:44.640
 you, what's the book you write about? It's about a group of people who are united solely by their

2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:51.440
 opposition to progressivism, who have little else in common, but who are all frequently caricatured

2:31:51.440 --> 2:31:59.360
 and dismissed by the larger establishment media. But you give this kind of story of how it came

2:31:59.360 --> 2:32:05.600
 to be. Sure. And to me, like we're talking about trolls, but the internet side of things is quite

2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:12.720
 interesting. So first of all, how does alt right connect? So the alt right is the subset of the

2:32:12.720 --> 2:32:20.400
 new right, which feels that race, not racism, is the most or one of the most important sociopolitical

2:32:20.400 --> 2:32:29.040
 issues. Are any of those folks like part of the mainstream or worth paying attention to?

2:32:29.040 --> 2:32:33.680
 Not on the mainstream. The alt right? Yeah. By definition, they would be part of the mainstream.

2:32:33.680 --> 2:32:38.720
 They would not be part of it. No, they would not. I don't know that any of them, well,

2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:44.400
 worth is not a position. I'm not a position to say worth. I would say that it is of use

2:32:45.200 --> 2:32:52.480
 to be familiar with their arguments because to dismiss any school of thought, especially one

2:32:52.480 --> 2:32:57.520
 that has historically gained leverage, especially one that has historically gained leverage in very

2:32:57.520 --> 2:33:02.880
 dark ways, especially in America, in Europe and other places, just to say, oh, they're racist.

2:33:02.880 --> 2:33:10.080
 I don't need to think about them. It doesn't behoove you. So what lessons do we draw from

2:33:10.720 --> 2:33:17.200
 the 4chan side of things, like the internet side of the movement? Tits or get the fuck out?

2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:24.800
 Can you define every single word in this? Tits are breasts or get the fuck out. That's from 4chan.

2:33:25.440 --> 2:33:30.480
 Okay. What does it mean? Sometimes a woman will appear in 4chan and they'll just reply,

2:33:30.480 --> 2:33:36.880
 tits or get the fuck out. I'm trying to understand. Oh, that's the way.

2:33:41.200 --> 2:33:48.640
 I just, very slow. Okay, so that's very disrespectful towards female

2:33:50.720 --> 2:33:55.840
 members of the community. I don't understand. There's rules to this community and one of them is,

2:33:55.840 --> 2:34:01.120
 we're not very good with women. That's one of the rules. It's a principle in a rule.

2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:07.760
 It's a principle. We're not going to ever get laid. That's fundamental principle.

2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:13.840
 Though we are going to get pics. Pics. Sometimes. Sometimes on the internet. Sometimes they GTFO?

2:34:15.040 --> 2:34:24.240
 Okay, so is there other actual principles of, so like, from my maybe naive perspective,

2:34:24.240 --> 2:34:28.000
 is they have like the darkest aspects of trolling, which is like take nothing serious,

2:34:28.640 --> 2:34:33.120
 make a game out of everything. That's not 4chan per se. One of the things that you will learn

2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:40.000
 4chan, which I think is very healthy, is if you have an idiosocratic or unique worldview or focus

2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:44.320
 on an aspect of history or culture, you'll be able to find likeminded people who you will engage

2:34:44.320 --> 2:34:51.040
 with you and discuss it without being preptly dismissive. That's an ideal that they, well,

2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:54.560
 it's not an ideal. It's something that happens a lot. Now 4chan's not really like Paul is their

2:34:54.560 --> 2:35:00.160
 board with politics, but they will, you know, get into some like, the people there are much

2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:05.280
 more erudite than you think. So they do take, my perception was they take nothing seriously. So

2:35:05.280 --> 2:35:09.520
 there's things that they take seriously, like discussing ideas. I'll give you one example.

2:35:09.520 --> 2:35:14.240
 There was a video someone posted of a girl who put kittens in a bag and threw it in a river,

2:35:14.240 --> 2:35:17.680
 and they found out where she was within a day and got her like arrested. So yeah,

2:35:17.680 --> 2:35:24.480
 they do take some things very seriously. Okay. But that's like an extreme that, I mean, that's

2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:28.560
 good. First of all, that's heartwarming that they wouldn't somehow turn that into a thing.

2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:34.720
 That feels like more of, what is it? What's the other one? 8chan? 8chan's twice as good as 4chan,

2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:41.840
 yeah. That's their slogan. But it feels like they're the kind of community that would take that kitten

2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:48.960
 situation and make a mockery. Yeah, they're darker than 4chan. I'm not allowed to talk

2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:57.680
 about 16chan. I'm already overwhelmed clearly by 4chan, lingo. I have actually, I literally wrote

2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:05.440
 down in my notes, like in doing research for this conversation, I learned the word pleb,

2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:10.560
 and I wanted to ask you what this pleb means. You know what pleb means? No.

2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:19.360
 I saw, I mean, actually, no, I don't. You know what a pleb is? I just, I don't know what a pleb

2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:25.520
 is. Like a plebocyte or plebian. Okay. But does it mean something more sophisticated?

2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:29.760
 No, it's a very unsophisticated mechanism of being dismissive.

2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:34.400
 Of like the regular people. Yeah, or someone who comes at me on Twitter.

2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:39.680
 Okay. All right. So back to the 4chan alt right. It wasn't the...

2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:42.640
 Those are very different concepts. Don't conflate them.

2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:47.600
 But which internet culture was the alt right born out of?

2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:53.600
 Well, alt right was more born of blogs and people had different blogs that were posting what they

2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:58.160
 call like racial realism, scientific, which is scientific racism, so called, and, you know,

2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:03.600
 breaking down issues from a racialist perspective. So that wasn't, 4chan is much more dynamic.

2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:08.560
 It's a message board. It's a very fluid. So it doesn't lend itself to these kind of

2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:13.520
 in depth analysis of ideas or history. But it spreads them. Like it...

2:37:13.520 --> 2:37:16.320
 It spreads them as memes. Yeah. And, you know, but...

2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:20.640
 But it's not an essential mechanism of the alt right historical...

2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:22.160
 No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

2:37:22.160 --> 2:37:28.880
 So it's mostly about blogs. Okay. So what do you make of the psychology of this kind of worldview?

2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:33.680
 Well, when you have... This goes to your conspiracy theory subject earlier.

2:37:33.680 --> 2:37:35.680
 When you have a little bit of knowledge about something,

2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:41.920
 that history that no one's talking about, and there's only one group that is talking about it,

2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:47.120
 and they... And you have no alternative answers, you're going to be drawn to that group.

2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:53.040
 So because issues about race, anti semitism, homophobia are so taboo in our culture,

2:37:53.760 --> 2:37:56.400
 understandably, there's good reasons. If you start putting things like,

2:37:56.400 --> 2:37:59.920
 how old should you be if you have sex with kids and just have regular conversations,

2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:02.320
 eventually some people are going to start taking some positions you don't like.

2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:04.400
 So some things have to be sanctified to some extent.

2:38:04.400 --> 2:38:08.880
 They're the only ones talking about it. You're going to be drawn to that subculture.

2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:14.480
 And where does the alt right stand now? I mean, I hear that term used...

2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:19.360
 So the term has been weaponized by the corporate press for people that they

2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:24.080
 want to read out of society. So it's used both on individual levels,

2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:27.760
 like people like Evan Mikingis, Milo Yiannopoulos, some others.

2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:34.400
 I mean, I think they refer to Trump as alt right, and it's become a slur,

2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:39.520
 just like incel or bot that has become largely removed from its original meaning.

2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:42.800
 Do you have a sense that there's still a movement that's alt right or like...

2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:46.560
 Yeah, they call themselves... Okay, so there's something called the dissident right,

2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:51.200
 and they say, we're completely not like the alt right because the alt rights A, B, and C,

2:38:51.200 --> 2:38:55.520
 and we're B, C, D. There's a huge overlap. It's very much the same people.

2:38:56.800 --> 2:39:01.200
 Is there intellectuals that still represent some alt, some aspect of the movement?

2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:03.200
 I mean, sure... Are you tracking this?

2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:08.560
 Not that much anymore. I think they're... I don't find it particularly as...

2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:14.720
 Now that the book's done, I'm looking more into history from my next book.

2:39:15.600 --> 2:39:16.720
 You mentioned communism.

2:39:16.720 --> 2:39:22.080
 I'm going to talk a lot about the Cold War, so this kind of stuff has largely fallen away from

2:39:22.080 --> 2:39:27.200
 my radar to some extent. And they've also been... It's been a very effective movement to get

2:39:27.200 --> 2:39:34.400
 them marginalized and silenced. So they're not as deep of a concern in terms of concern or not,

2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:37.200
 just their impact on society. Yes, it's much lessened, yeah.

2:39:38.320 --> 2:39:44.800
 So as a troll on Twitter, in the best sense of the word, what do you make of cancel culture?

2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:50.640
 I think it's Maoism. I mean, the corporate America has done a far better job of implementing

2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:54.160
 Maoism than the Communist Party ever could. You had this meeting not that long ago,

2:39:54.160 --> 2:39:57.920
 from I think it was Northwestern University Law School, where everyone on the call got up and

2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:02.400
 said that they were racist. I mean, this is something that legally you should be very adverse

2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:06.960
 to saying, even if it were true. And it's this kind of concept of getting up and confessing

2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:09.920
 your sins before the collective is something completely...

2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:15.440
 Oh, sorry, they admitted this of themselves? Yeah, they were like... Because they're saying

2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:18.400
 because they're white, they're inherently racist. So my name's John, I'm a racist,

2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:22.080
 my name's this, I'm a racist. It was... You hear it and you're like, okay, this is looting tunes.

2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:27.360
 So you're saying that... Wow, that's so much... You took a step further. So you're saying there's

2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:33.440
 like a deep underlying force, in a sense, cancel culture. It's not just some kind of mob...

2:40:33.440 --> 2:40:42.160
 It's not mob at all. It's a systemic, organized movement being used for very nefarious purposes

2:40:42.160 --> 2:40:47.360
 and to dominate an entire nation. How do we fight it? Because I sense it inside.

2:40:48.480 --> 2:41:00.320
 I used to defend academia more because I still do to some extent. It's a nuanced discussion

2:41:00.320 --> 2:41:06.720
 because like folks like Jordan Peterson and a lot of people that kind of attack academia,

2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:11.840
 they refer... They really are talking about gender studies at certain departments. And me,

2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:20.000
 from MIT, it's the University of Science and Engineering and the faculty there really don't

2:41:20.720 --> 2:41:25.760
 think about these issues or haven't traditionally thought about it. It's beginning to even infiltrate

2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:33.840
 there. It's starting to infiltrate engineering and sciences outside of biology. Let's put biology

2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:38.560
 with the gender studies. I'm talking about sciences that really don't have anything to do with gender.

2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:48.880
 It's starting to infiltrate. It worries me. I don't know exactly what the negative

2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:56.400
 effect there would be, except it feels like it's anti intellectual. Oh yes, of course.

2:41:57.200 --> 2:42:05.680
 And I'm not sure what to... On the surface, it feels like a path towards progress. At first,

2:42:06.240 --> 2:42:13.440
 when I'm like zoomed out, it's just like squinting my eyes, not even in detail looking at

2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:18.640
 things. But when I actually joined the conversation to listen in the conversation on quote unquote

2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:29.760
 diversity, it quickly makes me realize that there's no interest in making a better world.

2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:36.320
 No, no. It's about domination. It's about getting... Yeah. It's a way for... If you are a lowest status

2:42:36.320 --> 2:42:42.080
 white person, using anti racism is the only mechanism you will have to feel superior to another

2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:49.200
 human being. So it's very useful for them. In terms of fighting it, one of my suggestions

2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:54.000
 has been to seize all university endowments, which are the crystallization of privilege

2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.880
 and distribute that money as reparations. So be very effective by turning two populations

2:42:58.880 --> 2:43:03.200
 against each other and strongly diminishing the university's intellectual hegemony.

2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:09.360
 The universities are absolutely the real villains in the picture. Thankfully, they're also the least

2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:15.760
 prepared to be aggressed upon. And after the government and the corporate press, they are the

2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:20.080
 last leg of the stool and they don't know it's coming and it's going to get ugly and I cannot

2:43:20.080 --> 2:43:27.680
 wait. So this is where you and I disagree part one. We disagree in a sense that you want to dismantle

2:43:28.880 --> 2:43:33.920
 broken institutions. I don't think they're broken. They're working like by design. I think for over

2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:38.560
 a hundred years, they have been talking about bringing the next generation of American leaders,

2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:46.320
 which is code for promulgating an ideology based on egalitarian principles and world domination.

2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:56.480
 Let me try to express my lived experience. My experience at MIT is that there's a bunch of

2:43:56.480 --> 2:44:04.640
 administrators that are bureaucracy. I can say this is the nice thing about having a podcast,

2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:10.640
 I don't give a damn, is they're pretty useless. In fact, they get in the way. But there's faculty,

2:44:10.640 --> 2:44:18.000
 there's professors that are incredible. They're incredible human beings that all they do all day,

2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:26.480
 they're too busy. But for the most part, what they do all day is just like continually pursue

2:44:26.480 --> 2:44:32.320
 different little trajectories of curiosities in the various avenues of science that they work on.

2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:40.000
 And as a side effect of that, they mentor a group of students, sometimes a large group of students,

2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:47.200
 and also teach courses. And they're constantly sharing their passion with others. And my experience

2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:53.360
 is it's just a bunch of people who are curious about engineering and math and science, chemistry,

2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:58.480
 artificial intelligence, computer science, what I'm most familiar with. And there's never this

2:44:58.480 --> 2:45:06.160
 feeling of MIT being broken somehow, like this kind of feeling, like if I talk to you just now,

2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:11.120
 or like Eric Weinstein, there's a feeling like stuff is on fire, right? There's something

2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:19.040
 she believes broken. But when I'm in the system, especially before the COVID, before this kind

2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:25.200
 of tension, everything was great. There was no discussion of even diversity, all that kind of

2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:30.080
 stuff, the toxic stuff that we might be talking about right now. None of that was happening.

2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:36.400
 There's a bunch of people just in love with cool ideas, exploring ideas, being curious and learning

2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:43.920
 and all that kind of stuff. So I don't, my sense of academia was this is the place where kids in

2:45:43.920 --> 2:45:51.440
 their 20s, 30s, and 40s can continue the playground of science and having fun. It's, if you destroy

2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:57.120
 academia, if you destroy universities, like you're suggesting kind of lessening their power,

2:45:57.840 --> 2:46:01.600
 you take away the playground from these kids to play.

2:46:01.600 --> 2:46:04.320
 It's going to be hard for you to tell me that I'm anti playground.

2:46:04.320 --> 2:46:08.720
 Yeah. Well, I guess I'm saying you're anti certain kinds of playgrounds, which is.

2:46:08.720 --> 2:46:12.000
 Yeah. The ones that have the broken glass on the floor. Yeah. I am against those kinds of

2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:22.800
 playgrounds. No, no, you're, you're, you're, no, see, that you see, that you listen, that you wait.

2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:28.880
 Yeah. I would say you're being the watchful mother who, the one kid who hurt themselves

2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:33.040
 in the glass. One kid, it's entire generation after generation. I'm not a watchful mother.

2:46:33.040 --> 2:46:40.160
 I'm the guy with the flamethrower. No, I understand that, but you're using the one kid who was

2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:47.120
 always kind of like weird gender studies department that hurt themselves on the glass,

2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:53.760
 as opposed to the people who are like, obviously having fun in the playground and not playing

2:46:53.760 --> 2:46:59.600
 by the glass, the broken glass. And they're just, I mean, to me, some of the best innovations in

2:46:59.600 --> 2:47:07.280
 science happen in universities. Okay. You can't forget that universities don't have this liberal

2:47:07.280 --> 2:47:14.800
 logic. Like politics, like literally in every conversation until this year, until this, this

2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:19.280
 year, there's something happening, but every conversation I've ever had and nothing to do

2:47:19.280 --> 2:47:24.960
 with politics would never, Trump never came up. None of that ever come up. Nothing. Like all this

2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:30.800
 kind of idea that there's liberal, all that, that that's in the humanities. Yeah. But do you think

2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:34.800
 MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology might be a little bit of an outlier? Yeah,

2:47:34.800 --> 2:47:41.280
 there's probably is. Yeah. But I don't, I honestly don't think when people criticize academia,

2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:48.720
 they're looking at, they're in fact also picking the outliers, which is they're picking some of the

2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:53.120
 quote unquote, strongest gender studies department. This is nonsensical. When I was at Bucknell,

2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:57.600
 yeah, I was a college student, we had to take, you know, we had a bunch of electives and I

2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:02.960
 want to take a class on individual American individualism. One of the texts of the five

2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:10.960
 that we had to read was Birth of a Nation, the movie about the Klan. So there's no department

2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:18.080
 where these people are not thoroughgoing, hardcore ideologues. This is not a gender.

2:48:19.200 --> 2:48:24.000
 Fine. All the humanities, not just gender studies. Okay, fine. I can give you history,

2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:31.440
 English. Yes. All of them. Every university, as you know, has it mandatory in the curriculum,

2:48:31.440 --> 2:48:37.440
 they have to take a bunch of these propaganda classes. I look forward to YouTube comments

2:48:37.440 --> 2:48:41.840
 because you're being more eloquent and you're speaking to the thing that a lot of people agree

2:48:41.840 --> 2:48:46.880
 with and I'm being my usual slow self and people are going to say not very nice things about me.

2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:51.840
 Don't say anything that nice about Lex. Okay. Please. Let me try to just shoot up a school.

2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:57.680
 That would be preferable. There he goes again. Only the teachers. Going to the darkest possible

2:48:57.680 --> 2:49:01.440
 place. That's sunshine, baby schools. That's where everyone goes to be happy. Playgrounds.

2:49:01.440 --> 2:49:08.480
 There he goes. Dark ear. Just dives right in. Just go dark and then just comes back

2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:13.600
 off to the surface. You don't have to feel this way anymore. Just one day.

2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:21.120
 You're probably a figment of my imagination. I'm not even having this podcast.

2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:24.400
 Well, after 18 Red Bulls, I'm surprised you could see anything.

2:49:24.400 --> 2:49:28.400
 This is like Fight Club. Red Bull gives you deliria. Yeah.

2:49:28.400 --> 2:49:33.440
 Fight Club. I got into it at Norton yesterday on Twitter. Oh, really? Yeah.

2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:38.080
 Is he like the rest of the celebrities? Yeah. He's like, oh, this is an existential threat to

2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:42.800
 America. Trump's a fascist. He's delegitimizing the Oval Office. I said, what an odd endorsement of Trump.

2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:47.360
 Well, you should have went blue bad pit. He might have a different opinion. That's true.

2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:51.440
 Fight Club reference. Okay. Yeah. This conversation is over.

2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:57.040
 It's interesting. I'd like to draw a line between science and engineering and science

2:49:57.040 --> 2:50:05.040
 not including the biological aspect, the parts of biology that touch and humanities and biology.

2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:11.120
 I feel because humanities, if you just look at the percentage of universities, it's still

2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:17.440
 a minority percentage. I would actually draw different, I think they serve very different

2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:26.480
 purposes. Sure. That's actually a broken part about universities. Why is some of the best

2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:33.440
 research in the world done at universities? There might be a different... MIT, it feels weird

2:50:33.440 --> 2:50:37.040
 that a faculty... Yeah, these are conceptually different things. We do research and we teach.

2:50:37.040 --> 2:50:43.040
 Why is this the same? Yeah, it feels weird. But I'm also coming to the defense of the

2:50:43.040 --> 2:50:52.720
 engineers that never talk about... I'm not deluded or something where I'm not seeing the

2:50:52.720 --> 2:50:57.200
 house on fire. I'm just saying I am seeing the house because I also lived in Harvard Square.

2:50:57.200 --> 2:51:02.320
 I'm seeing Harvard, but... When you see the tanks coming, they're coming, Lex. It's going to be so

2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:07.120
 beautiful. It'll be like the American beauty, the plastic bag. I just won't be able to stop crying

2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:12.560
 because it'll be so beautiful for tanks. I can already see it. But the engineering

2:51:12.560 --> 2:51:20.480
 departments where I believe that the Elon Musk's of the world, the innovation

2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:25.440
 that will make a better world is happening, and let's not burn that down because that has

2:51:25.440 --> 2:51:33.040
 nothing to do with any... They're all sitting quietly while the humanities and all these

2:51:33.040 --> 2:51:38.160
 kind of diversity programs, they're not having any of these discussions. Listen, my Soviet brother,

2:51:38.160 --> 2:51:43.440
 you both know that ice water runs in our veins. So if you're calling for mercy, that is not how

2:51:43.440 --> 2:51:49.600
 I'm wired, but I'm not closing the door. Yeah. I'm actually realizing now, so for people listening

2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:55.440
 to this, I'll probably prepend this and saying that I'm even slower than usual. I didn't sleep

2:51:55.440 --> 2:52:02.400
 last night, but I feel I'm actually realizing just how slow I am and how much preparation I need to do

2:52:02.400 --> 2:52:08.720
 and if I would like to defend the aspects of academia, I better come prepared. I don't think

2:52:08.720 --> 2:52:13.440
 you need to defend them. I think I'm granting you your premise freely. No, you might be.

2:52:14.400 --> 2:52:20.080
 I don't think the world is. Actually, you just defeat your own argument because it is not at all

2:52:20.080 --> 2:52:25.840
 have to be the way that a phenomenal research institution like MIT, which no one disputes,

2:52:25.840 --> 2:52:31.360
 has to also be an educational establishment. These two things are not at all necessarily

2:52:31.360 --> 2:52:36.720
 interconnected. But then you have to offer a way to separate them. Correct. But I'm not a big fan.

2:52:37.920 --> 2:52:42.080
 Everybody's different, but I'm not a fan of criticizing institutions without offering

2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:46.480
 a way to change. And especially when I'm like, have ability to change, I'd like to,

2:52:47.680 --> 2:52:51.520
 yeah, I'd like to offer a path. What if they weren't students, they were all mentors?

2:52:54.080 --> 2:53:00.640
 What's the opposite of mentor? Menti. Protégé. What's the term when you work at a place,

2:53:00.640 --> 2:53:03.920
 interns, not an intern, it's not the one I'm thinking of. But anyway, like basically,

2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:08.160
 they're working there instead of going to college there. It's possible, but it's going against

2:53:08.160 --> 2:53:12.960
 tradition. And so you have to build new institutions and then. Can't have these engineers building

2:53:12.960 --> 2:53:17.600
 new things. That's crazy. Yeah. These research engineers, where they're going to be building

2:53:17.600 --> 2:53:22.080
 things. Well, one of the things, because you're kind of, you know, apprentice, that's the word I

2:53:22.080 --> 2:53:25.280
 was looking at. Apprentice. Which is ironic, we're talking about Trump and we couldn't think of the

2:53:25.280 --> 2:53:33.280
 word apprentice. Yeah. Well done. We should both be fired. There you go. These Russian Jews so

2:53:33.280 --> 2:53:39.360
 quick with their wit. Okay. But the thing is, you're a fan of freedom. I am. And there's,

2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:45.840
 there is intellectual freedom. People, this is what I was trying to articulate. I'm failing to

2:53:45.840 --> 2:53:52.080
 articulate, but there truly is complete intellectual freedom within universities

2:53:52.080 --> 2:53:58.320
 on topics of science and engineering. I believe you. Yeah. I agree with you. I don't think it's

2:53:58.320 --> 2:54:03.120
 going to take much persuasion, but I'll give you an example. When that, I'm sure you know

2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:10.320
 the more details about this than I do. When that scientist engineered that probe to land on that

2:54:10.320 --> 2:54:15.440
 comet. And the articles are written because this Hawaiian shirt he was wearing had like

2:54:15.440 --> 2:54:18.960
 pinup girls on it, which I think is female student, so frame or something, where his ex

2:54:18.960 --> 2:54:24.720
 girlfriend and he had to apologize. This is what Rand was talking about. Yeah. That the great

2:54:24.720 --> 2:54:30.960
 accomplishments of men have to say, I'm sorry, to the lowest, most despicable, disgusting people.

2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:36.480
 Yeah. I don't know. You know, let me bring this case up because I think about this.

2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:41.760
 This might not mean much to you, but it means a lot to certain aspects of the computer science

2:54:41.760 --> 2:54:47.840
 community. There's a guy named Richard Stallman. I don't know if you know who that is. No. He's the

2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:53.280
 founder of the free software foundation. He's like a big Linux. He's one of the key people in

2:54:53.280 --> 2:54:57.920
 the history of computer science. One of those open source people, right? But he is like,

2:54:57.920 --> 2:55:02.640
 I believe he's the one of the hardcore ones, which is like saw all software should be free.

2:55:02.640 --> 2:55:08.320
 Okay. Okay. So it's very interesting personality, very key person in the new, just like Linus

2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:18.320
 Torvald, key person. So, but he also kind of speaks his mind and on a certain chain of conversations

2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:26.960
 at MIT that was leaked to the New York Times, then was published, let him to be fired or pushed out

2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:33.600
 of MIT recently, maybe a year ago. And it always set weird with me. So what happened is

2:55:33.600 --> 2:55:41.680
 there's a few undergraduate students that called Marvin Minsky. Not sure if you're

2:55:41.680 --> 2:55:45.280
 familiar with who that is. I've heard the name. He's one of the seminal people in artificial

2:55:45.280 --> 2:55:52.400
 intelligence. They said that they called him a rapist because he met with Jeffrey Epstein.

2:55:53.040 --> 2:56:00.800
 And Jeffrey Epstein solicited, these are the best facts known to me that I'm aware of. That's

2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:06.240
 what was stated on the chain is he solicited a 17, but it might have been an 18 year old girl

2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:12.000
 to come up to Marvin Minsky and ask him if he wanted to have sex with her.

2:56:13.440 --> 2:56:19.040
 So Jeffrey Epstein told the girl, she came up to Marvin Minsky who was at that time is,

2:56:19.040 --> 2:56:25.520
 I think, seven years old and his wife was there too, Marvin Minsky's wife. And he said no or like,

2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:34.720
 you know, awkwardly saying, no, thanks. And that was stated in the email thread

2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:45.120
 as Marvin participating in sexual assault and rape of this unwilling sexual assault. And it

2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:52.960
 was called rape of this person, right? Of this woman that propositioned him. And then Richard

2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:59.040
 Stallman, who's, he's kind of known for this. He's very, he's, you make fun of me being a robot,

2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:03.920
 but he's kind of like a debugger. He's like, well, that sentence is not what you said is not

2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:13.840
 correct. So he like corrected the person basically made it seem like the use of the word rape is

2:57:13.840 --> 2:57:18.960
 not correct because that's not the definition of rape. And then he was attacked for saying,

2:57:18.960 --> 2:57:24.800
 oh, now you're playing with definitions of rape. Rape is rape is the answer, right? And then that

2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:34.480
 was leaked in him defending. So the way it was leaked, it was reported as him defending rape.

2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:40.080
 That's the way it was reported. And he was pushed out and he didn't really give a damn.

2:57:40.800 --> 2:57:46.240
 It's, he doesn't seem to make a big deal out of it. He just left. He made an example of him.

2:57:46.240 --> 2:57:52.240
 They made an example and that, and that everyone was afraid to defend him. So like, there's a

2:57:52.240 --> 2:57:56.800
 bunch of faculty one, dude, you're from the Soviet Union. Doesn't this hit close to home for you?

2:57:58.320 --> 2:58:01.920
 I don't know what to think of it. It hits close to home, but it was basically,

2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:08.320
 at least at MIT. Now, MIT is such a light place with this. It's not common at MIT,

2:58:08.320 --> 2:58:13.520
 but it was like 18, 19 year old kids, undergraduate kids with this kind of fire in them.

2:58:13.520 --> 2:58:18.000
 There's just very few of them, but they're the ones that raise all this kind of fuss.

2:58:19.120 --> 2:58:25.440
 And the entirety of the administration, all the faculty are afraid to stand up to them.

2:58:26.640 --> 2:58:30.960
 It's so interesting to me. Like, I don't know if I should be afraid of that.

2:58:31.680 --> 2:58:35.040
 You don't think you should be afraid that someone who's trying to be specific when it

2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:40.240
 comes to charges of violent assault is looking for that clarity to get their life out of search.

2:58:40.240 --> 2:58:46.400
 Let me give you more context. There's a little bit more context to Richard Stallman, which is...

2:58:46.400 --> 2:58:47.440
 He was also a rapist.

2:58:48.800 --> 2:58:49.120
 No.

2:58:49.120 --> 2:58:51.040
 I left out that part. He liked raping people.

2:58:51.040 --> 2:58:57.840
 But he's had a history through his life of, you know, every once in a while wearing the

2:58:57.840 --> 2:59:06.240
 Hawaiian shirt with, like he would make, he's a fat, sorry, but he's a fat unattractive.

2:59:06.240 --> 2:59:11.840
 He, like what Trump referred to the hacker in the basement, that's Richard.

2:59:11.840 --> 2:59:17.840
 Okay. I love, you know, he is what he is. You know, people, he like, he would eat his own,

2:59:18.400 --> 2:59:21.520
 he would pick skin from his feet in lectures and just eat it.

2:59:21.520 --> 2:59:21.840
 No.

2:59:21.840 --> 2:59:24.000
 Okay. Yeah. Those videos him doing that.

2:59:24.000 --> 2:59:26.800
 He must, I'm not joking. He must really behind the spectrum then.

2:59:26.800 --> 2:59:27.360
 Yeah. Okay.

2:59:27.360 --> 2:59:37.600
 Yeah. And, you know, I think this, and his office, door, he wrote something like

2:59:41.040 --> 2:59:48.000
 hacker plus lover of ladies or something like that. Like something kind of, yeah.

2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:48.640
 Yeah.

2:59:48.640 --> 2:59:49.920
 Unprofessional.

2:59:49.920 --> 2:59:51.760
 Yeah. Unprofessional. And a little creepy.

2:59:51.760 --> 2:59:52.720
 Yeah. Yeah. No, that's fair.

2:59:52.720 --> 2:59:53.120
 That is, yeah.

2:59:53.120 --> 2:59:54.240
 So he was also...

2:59:54.240 --> 2:59:56.400
 So they're looking for an excuse to get rid of him.

2:59:56.400 --> 2:59:57.680
 It sounds like.

2:59:57.680 --> 3:00:00.480
 No. He was just a, who's they?

3:00:00.480 --> 3:00:01.440
 The administration.

3:00:02.480 --> 3:00:03.520
 Yeah. Probably.

3:00:03.520 --> 3:00:03.920
 Probably.

3:00:03.920 --> 3:00:07.840
 A lot of times what people don't realize, and this would be my defensive cancel culture,

3:00:08.400 --> 3:00:11.200
 a lot of times when someone gets fired over something like this,

3:00:11.200 --> 3:00:15.440
 this isn't why. This is just giving them cover to get rid of them without getting a lawsuit.

3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:16.240
 Yeah.

3:00:16.240 --> 3:00:17.040
 But it's still...

3:00:17.920 --> 3:00:18.720
 Gross.

3:00:18.720 --> 3:00:23.440
 So I think, I guess what I'm trying to communicate is he was a little weird and creepy

3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:30.080
 and he may not be the best for the community, but that's not necessarily the message it's

3:00:30.080 --> 3:00:35.600
 sent to the rest of the community. The message is sent to the rest of the community that being

3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:41.840
 clear about words or the usage of the word rape is like, you should call everything rape.

3:00:41.840 --> 3:00:44.320
 That's basically the message he was sent.

3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:48.240
 Or you should call that we say rape rape. It's about submission.

3:00:48.240 --> 3:00:51.920
 I think I'm, you'd be very happy to know that there's a lot of people,

3:00:51.920 --> 3:00:56.000
 and she's very crucified, but it's like Betsy DeVos from the Department of Education,

3:00:56.000 --> 3:01:00.480
 who are aware of this. They are aware that it's completely contradicts due process.

3:01:01.360 --> 3:01:05.360
 They're aware of how a rape accusation is something not to be taken seriously,

3:01:05.360 --> 3:01:09.280
 but because it's not to be taken seriously, it has to be also taken seriously in the other context

3:01:09.280 --> 3:01:13.280
 that once that word is around a male, this can ruin his entire life.

3:01:14.320 --> 3:01:16.960
 And that's the sticky thing of the word.

3:01:16.960 --> 3:01:22.480
 Like I think about this a lot that,

3:01:24.640 --> 3:01:29.200
 like how would I defend it if somebody, like I've never, I can honestly say I've never done

3:01:29.200 --> 3:01:34.560
 anything close to creepy in my life, like with women.

3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:36.240
 But you wouldn't know it if you had, right?

3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:38.880
 That's the thing. A lot of these creepy guys don't think they're creepy.

3:01:38.880 --> 3:01:39.920
 They think they're being cute.

3:01:39.920 --> 3:01:47.040
 Yeah, but I'm just telling you, even like, fine, let's say, right, let's say I'm not aware of it,

3:01:47.040 --> 3:01:52.480
 but the point that I am aware of is that somebody could just completely make something up.

3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:54.080
 Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

3:01:54.080 --> 3:01:56.000
 And like what a, what would I do?

3:01:56.000 --> 3:01:59.440
 No, he denied the charges. There's an article around everything he did, supposedly.

3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:01.920
 And it goes, Mr. Friedman denied the charges. Yeah.

3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:04.160
 But what creeps me out?

3:02:04.160 --> 3:02:05.280
 That happened. Can I interrupt?

3:02:05.280 --> 3:02:07.280
 There's Zorniel Hurston is one of my favorite writers.

3:02:07.280 --> 3:02:08.480
 She's from the Harlem Renaissance.

3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:12.400
 Um, she wrote, their eyes are watching God, a couple of other books.

3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:14.240
 She was just an amazing, amazing figure.

3:02:14.240 --> 3:02:16.560
 Her biography is called, um, wrapped in rainbows.

3:02:16.560 --> 3:02:18.720
 It's just a masterpiece. I like, I think I read it one day.

3:02:18.720 --> 3:02:19.680
 Can't recommend her enough.

3:02:19.680 --> 3:02:20.880
 Fascinating, fascinating woman.

3:02:21.600 --> 3:02:24.080
 During the thirties, I think it was her 1940.

3:02:24.720 --> 3:02:25.680
 She was out of the country.

3:02:26.240 --> 3:02:29.280
 She was accused of molesting a teenage boy.

3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:31.200
 She wasn't in America.

3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:33.120
 This could be proven.

3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:34.880
 So there's, it's absolutely false.

3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:36.000
 Not even a question.

3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:39.040
 She was indicted and she wanted to kill herself

3:02:39.840 --> 3:02:43.040
 because she's like, people are going to see these things.

3:02:43.680 --> 3:02:45.360
 And they're going to think maybe there's some truth to it.

3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:47.760
 Maybe it was voluntary, what they're just going to,

3:02:47.760 --> 3:02:50.320
 and you could understand why she'd be suicidal over this.

3:02:50.880 --> 3:02:53.440
 So yeah, this is, this is something that's been going on for a long time.

3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:56.320
 And in the fact that it's becoming, I do agree.

3:02:56.320 --> 3:02:59.520
 It's important. I know a lot of women who have been sexually assaulted

3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:01.440
 more than I am happy that I know.

3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:03.760
 And if I know that many, that means there's more.

3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:08.400
 So I don't, I think it's, it's a good idea that they feel seen,

3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:09.680
 that they don't feel wounded.

3:03:09.680 --> 3:03:11.920
 They don't feel damaged or they could talk to their friends.

3:03:11.920 --> 3:03:13.840
 And I'm like, man, this sucks as having you.

3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:15.600
 And, and I don't think you're a slut.

3:03:15.600 --> 3:03:16.720
 I don't think you're asking for it.

3:03:16.720 --> 3:03:17.760
 I think you feel violated.

3:03:17.760 --> 3:03:19.760
 If he gets gross, talk to me.

3:03:19.760 --> 3:03:21.760
 Like I do think that that's important.

3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:23.520
 And I also think it's important though,

3:03:23.520 --> 3:03:25.760
 like when things get kind of in a frenzy,

3:03:26.480 --> 3:03:29.440
 that a lot of people like, yeah, I also had something happen.

3:03:29.440 --> 3:03:33.040
 And very quickly, the line between he grabbed my boob

3:03:33.040 --> 3:03:34.720
 and he violently raped me.

3:03:34.720 --> 3:03:36.960
 I don't think these two things are the same at all.

3:03:36.960 --> 3:03:38.800
 I think they're both sexual assault.

3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:41.680
 But in terms of what someone can deal with the next day,

3:03:41.680 --> 3:03:42.960
 the next month, 10 years later,

3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:45.520
 I don't think they're similar scenarios.

3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:47.280
 Yeah.

3:03:47.280 --> 3:03:50.560
 I had Juanita Broderick on my show and hearing her talk about,

3:03:50.560 --> 3:03:55.280
 you know, her alleged rape by Bill Clinton was very disturbing for me.

3:03:55.280 --> 3:03:58.000
 Very disturbing to hear because it was like half an hour.

3:03:58.640 --> 3:04:00.160
 So, you know, we think of these things and think,

3:04:00.160 --> 3:04:01.840
 okay, hold her down, blah, blah, blah.

3:04:01.840 --> 3:04:03.600
 And then it's done half an hour when,

3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:06.400
 just even someone physically holding you down for half an hour.

3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:08.160
 Like not even a sexual assault.

3:04:08.160 --> 3:04:09.840
 Like that's traumatic.

3:04:09.840 --> 3:04:10.560
 You think, am I gonna,

3:04:10.560 --> 3:04:12.320
 your brain's gonna think am I gonna die?

3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:15.840
 When I zoom out, I think the ultimately,

3:04:15.840 --> 3:04:17.600
 this is gonna lead to a better world.

3:04:18.560 --> 3:04:23.120
 Like empowering women to speak to those kinds of experiences.

3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:27.440
 The benefit of it outweighs the.

3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:30.240
 The issue is whenever people are given a weapon,

3:04:30.240 --> 3:04:33.120
 some are going to use it in nefarious ways.

3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:34.480
 And that's the lesson of history.

3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:38.400
 Males, when males, females, whites, blacks, children, adults,

3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:41.600
 when people are given a mechanism to execute power for others,

3:04:41.600 --> 3:04:42.560
 some are gonna use it.

3:04:43.280 --> 3:04:45.440
 Can I ask you for a therapy thing?

3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:48.400
 Sure.

3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:49.920
 Untrolling in a sense.

3:04:51.280 --> 3:04:53.680
 Because I mentioned somebody making up something about me.

3:04:54.880 --> 3:04:56.960
 I feel because I wear my heart on my sleeve.

3:04:56.960 --> 3:05:00.960
 I'm not good with these attacks.

3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:03.600
 Like I've been attacked recently,

3:05:03.600 --> 3:05:06.240
 just being called a fraud and all that kind of stuff.

3:05:06.240 --> 3:05:07.120
 Just light stuff.

3:05:07.120 --> 3:05:10.800
 Like I haven't, you know, it was like, it hurt.

3:05:11.760 --> 3:05:13.360
 Okay, well, let me help you.

3:05:13.360 --> 3:05:14.720
 Maybe it's because I'm a New Yorker.

3:05:15.680 --> 3:05:16.400
 No, I'm serious.

3:05:16.400 --> 3:05:16.880
 Here's why.

3:05:17.680 --> 3:05:21.680
 In New York, a lot of times you'll be walking with your friend

3:05:22.320 --> 3:05:24.560
 and a homeless person will come up to you

3:05:24.560 --> 3:05:25.760
 and start yelling things at you.

3:05:25.760 --> 3:05:28.880
 Your reaction isn't in those circumstances.

3:05:28.880 --> 3:05:30.320
 Let me hear this out.

3:05:30.320 --> 3:05:34.240
 Your reaction is physical safety and getting away.

3:05:34.240 --> 3:05:37.680
 Now, it's not impossible that that homeless person

3:05:37.680 --> 3:05:38.880
 is actually saying the truth.

3:05:38.880 --> 3:05:40.480
 This happened to my friend of mine.

3:05:40.480 --> 3:05:44.880
 This guy wasn't homeless and he's walking down the street

3:05:44.880 --> 3:05:47.280
 on Smith Street and he's just talking out loud.

3:05:47.280 --> 3:05:49.680
 And it goes, why they call them hipsters?

3:05:49.680 --> 3:05:50.720
 What are they a hip to?

3:05:50.720 --> 3:05:54.160
 And she chuckles and it goes, what are you laughing at, fatso?

3:05:54.160 --> 3:05:55.920
 You start something, I'll finish it.

3:05:55.920 --> 3:05:57.920
 And she just couldn't move.

3:05:59.200 --> 3:06:01.600
 And it's like, it might be a problem

3:06:01.600 --> 3:06:02.880
 because that's the first thing he went to.

3:06:02.880 --> 3:06:06.720
 And there's, I don't know that I have any advice,

3:06:06.720 --> 3:06:09.440
 but when you hear something like this,

3:06:09.440 --> 3:06:12.480
 I think you need to be better in terms of boundaries.

3:06:12.480 --> 3:06:15.200
 I think you should not perceive this as a fellow human,

3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:20.480
 but as a crazy homeless person because if this fellow human,

3:06:20.480 --> 3:06:24.240
 if I thought that you were a fraud in some context,

3:06:24.240 --> 3:06:25.440
 that's a very weird word to use

3:06:25.440 --> 3:06:28.400
 because fraudulent podcaster, these are real mics.

3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:29.360
 But if I thought...

3:06:29.360 --> 3:06:31.200
 Well, scientists are human.

3:06:31.200 --> 3:06:33.200
 Sure, but I would ask myself,

3:06:33.200 --> 3:06:35.760
 is this person in a position to make this judgment?

3:06:35.760 --> 3:06:37.200
 Or are they backing it up?

3:06:37.200 --> 3:06:40.000
 Are they saying, here, your conclusions were wrong,

3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:41.840
 here's some mistakes in your data,

3:06:41.840 --> 3:06:43.840
 and you can engage with them in ideas,

3:06:43.840 --> 3:06:45.600
 but whenever someone uses a word

3:06:45.600 --> 3:06:47.200
 to entirely dismiss your life

3:06:47.200 --> 3:06:49.840
 without having the knowledge of your life,

3:06:49.840 --> 3:06:52.560
 you do not have to take that seriously.

3:06:52.560 --> 3:06:54.560
 I appreciate that kind of idea,

3:06:54.560 --> 3:06:57.520
 but some things aren't about data.

3:06:57.520 --> 3:07:01.120
 Like, you know, I see myself as a fraud often,

3:07:01.120 --> 3:07:05.120
 and it's more psychology of it.

3:07:05.120 --> 3:07:08.160
 If I can reduce something to reason,

3:07:08.160 --> 3:07:10.160
 I can probably be fine.

3:07:10.160 --> 3:07:13.760
 My worry is the same as the worry of teenage girls

3:07:13.760 --> 3:07:15.280
 that get bullied online.

3:07:15.280 --> 3:07:18.160
 It's like, when I'm being open and fragile on the Internet,

3:07:18.160 --> 3:07:21.040
 it affects me in a way where I can't...

3:07:21.040 --> 3:07:22.560
 The reason doesn't help.

3:07:22.560 --> 3:07:23.600
 So it helps me, but...

3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:24.800
 You don't block people enough.

3:07:24.800 --> 3:07:26.000
 I'm very heavy with the blocking.

3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:27.680
 No, I... So, yeah, I block...

3:07:27.680 --> 3:07:28.560
 Very heavy.

3:07:28.560 --> 3:07:30.400
 I block... It's helped a lot.

3:07:30.400 --> 3:07:32.880
 Any aggressive banality, I block immediately.

3:07:32.880 --> 3:07:34.640
 I also think time is going to help.

3:07:34.640 --> 3:07:36.080
 I don't think you're...

3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:38.640
 Like, you grew up wanting to be a podcaster, right?

3:07:38.640 --> 3:07:40.160
 That wasn't your aspiration.

3:07:40.160 --> 3:07:42.080
 So in some sense, you are going to feel like a fraud

3:07:42.080 --> 3:07:43.680
 because you're like, I don't have any training for this.

3:07:43.680 --> 3:07:44.880
 I have training for a scientist.

3:07:44.880 --> 3:07:46.480
 I can talk to you about artificial intelligence

3:07:46.480 --> 3:07:48.240
 for literally hours.

3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:49.840
 But in terms of this, I don't know what I'm doing.

3:07:49.840 --> 3:07:50.720
 I'm kind of...

3:07:50.720 --> 3:07:54.000
 So when they call you a fake, it's like, yeah, you're kind of right.

3:07:54.000 --> 3:07:56.400
 Because I did kind of stumble into this.

3:07:56.400 --> 3:07:58.560
 And this is not my pedigree.

3:07:58.560 --> 3:08:01.600
 So I think that kind of probably speaks to you on some level.

3:08:01.600 --> 3:08:04.000
 But they're attacking not the podcast thing,

3:08:04.000 --> 3:08:05.920
 but more like the same...

3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:07.760
 People call Elon Musk a fraud, too.

3:08:07.760 --> 3:08:10.000
 Which that's the way I rationalize it.

3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:12.480
 Like, well, if they're calling him a fraud

3:08:12.480 --> 3:08:14.560
 and they're calling me a fraud,

3:08:14.560 --> 3:08:17.920
 like, even if you have rockets that go into...

3:08:17.920 --> 3:08:22.800
 Like, if you successfully have rockets landing back on Earth,

3:08:22.800 --> 3:08:26.000
 reusable rockets, you're still being called a fraud,

3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:28.480
 then it's okay.

3:08:28.480 --> 3:08:29.360
 Not necessarily.

3:08:29.360 --> 3:08:31.840
 It could be that he's not a fraud, and you really are.

3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:33.280
 That's...

3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:35.600
 It's not resonating with you because your brain knows the logic,

3:08:35.600 --> 3:08:36.720
 so you can't create yourself.

3:08:36.720 --> 3:08:39.680
 Right. But, yeah.

3:08:39.680 --> 3:08:40.480
 Yeah.

3:08:40.480 --> 3:08:41.280
 But I don't know.

3:08:41.280 --> 3:08:42.720
 This whole trolling thing,

3:08:42.720 --> 3:08:48.000
 you seem to be much better at seeing it as a game.

3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:49.040
 You know why?

3:08:49.040 --> 3:08:51.440
 Because you are under the delusion

3:08:51.440 --> 3:08:55.200
 that every human being is capable of intelligent, reasoned decisions.

3:08:55.200 --> 3:08:56.000
 I still think I'm right.

3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:58.720
 And I perceive them as literally animals.

3:08:58.720 --> 3:09:01.040
 So when a dog starts barking,

3:09:01.040 --> 3:09:03.040
 all it's saying is that the dog is agitated,

3:09:03.040 --> 3:09:04.800
 and this is not going to change my life

3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:07.040
 when I order other than crossing the street, perhaps.

3:09:07.040 --> 3:09:08.240
 Yeah.

3:09:08.240 --> 3:09:09.920
 I'm going to prove you wrong one day.

3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:12.800
 Yeah. I'm going to prove you wrong one day.

3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:15.440
 If you're going to kill yourself because they can drive you to it.

3:09:15.440 --> 3:09:17.440
 The first shoot up of school.

3:09:17.440 --> 3:09:19.200
 But if I don't, I'll prove you wrong.

3:09:19.200 --> 3:09:20.480
 I'll bring the data.

3:09:20.480 --> 3:09:22.080
 And they'd be like, you're right, Lex.

3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:23.200
 I have the receipts.

3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:24.960
 I have the receipts.

3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:25.760
 Okay.

3:09:25.760 --> 3:09:27.520
 So we mentioned Camu.

3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:29.200
 Oh, yeah, I love him.

3:09:29.200 --> 3:09:30.640
 Is there...

3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:35.440
 This is a question that people love when I ask.

3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:37.200
 A really smart paper.

3:09:37.200 --> 3:09:39.600
 Or it is love.

3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:40.720
 No.

3:09:40.720 --> 3:09:43.920
 What books, let's say three books,

3:09:44.720 --> 3:09:48.640
 if you can think of them, technical, fiction, philosophical,

3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:51.920
 would you had a big impact on you?

3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:53.520
 Or would you recommend to others?

3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:54.160
 Sure.

3:09:54.160 --> 3:09:56.000
 The Machiavellians by James Burnham.

3:09:56.800 --> 3:09:59.680
 This is a book about how politics works in reality

3:09:59.680 --> 3:10:02.080
 as opposed to how people imagine it working.

3:10:03.280 --> 3:10:05.520
 Menchus Moldbug, who's a figure in these circles,

3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:07.280
 who's respected by a lot of people.

3:10:07.280 --> 3:10:10.320
 I was giving a talk and there was a bunch of panelists

3:10:10.320 --> 3:10:12.480
 and we were asked, what book would you recommend?

3:10:12.480 --> 3:10:14.000
 I said the Machiavellians.

3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:16.960
 Independently of me, that was the book he had recommended.

3:10:16.960 --> 3:10:17.680
 It's out of print.

3:10:17.680 --> 3:10:19.680
 It's hard to find, but that would be one...

3:10:19.680 --> 3:10:20.720
 Is that his book or no?

3:10:20.720 --> 3:10:21.360
 James Burnham.

3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:23.440
 It came out in 1941, I think.

3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:26.560
 So can you pause on the mulchers?

3:10:26.560 --> 3:10:27.280
 Menchus Moldbug.

3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:29.040
 That's a code name, right?

3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:30.880
 That guy's dependent.

3:10:30.880 --> 3:10:31.920
 Curtis Jarvan.

3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:32.720
 This is his real name.

3:10:33.280 --> 3:10:34.800
 He swims in your circles.

3:10:35.840 --> 3:10:36.720
 He doesn't plan a program.

3:10:36.720 --> 3:10:38.480
 Oh, he's originally a program.

3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:43.520
 He comes up as a person that I should talk with

3:10:43.520 --> 3:10:44.960
 or I should know about,

3:10:44.960 --> 3:10:46.560
 but then I read a few of his things

3:10:46.560 --> 3:10:47.840
 and they seem quite dangerous.

3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:50.640
 They're very long and verbose,

3:10:50.640 --> 3:10:52.320
 but I think he's an amazing thinker.

3:10:53.200 --> 3:10:54.320
 But he's the one who had the idea

3:10:54.320 --> 3:10:55.600
 of sending the tanks to Harvard Yard.

3:10:56.320 --> 3:10:57.520
 But doesn't he have like...

3:11:00.160 --> 3:11:01.120
 Here's some radical views.

3:11:01.120 --> 3:11:02.080
 I forget what they are.

3:11:02.080 --> 3:11:02.960
 Very radical views.

3:11:02.960 --> 3:11:04.160
 Yeah, he wants a military coup.

3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:08.320
 But you're saying he's a serious thinker

3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:11.840
 that is worthy of not worthy.

3:11:11.840 --> 3:11:13.040
 I don't know that you would enjoy

3:11:13.040 --> 3:11:14.240
 having a conversation with him.

3:11:14.240 --> 3:11:16.000
 I think a lot of people enjoy seeing it happen,

3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:17.280
 but I think it'd be a lot of talking

3:11:17.280 --> 3:11:20.560
 past each other and it would be interesting.

3:11:20.560 --> 3:11:22.800
 What do you agree and would you disagree?

3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:23.040
 Okay.

3:11:23.920 --> 3:11:24.480
 What do you agree?

3:11:24.480 --> 3:11:25.280
 What do you disagree with?

3:11:25.280 --> 3:11:29.920
 I agree with him that politics has to be looked at objectively

3:11:29.920 --> 3:11:33.040
 and without kind of an emotional connection

3:11:33.040 --> 3:11:34.400
 to different schools.

3:11:34.400 --> 3:11:36.240
 I talk about him a lot in my book on the new right.

3:11:38.240 --> 3:11:38.800
 Disagree?

3:11:38.800 --> 3:11:41.040
 I don't think a military coup is a good idea.

3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:43.600
 He doesn't think anarchism is stable.

3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:44.240
 I disagree.

3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:48.960
 I mean, to me and him, I did his live stream with him.

3:11:48.960 --> 3:11:50.320
 We just dorked out a lot about history

3:11:50.320 --> 3:11:52.800
 and like people who've fallen in the memory hole.

3:11:52.800 --> 3:11:55.280
 So, I mean, he's got a lot of writing.

3:11:56.080 --> 3:11:58.320
 So, you know, the sense I got from him

3:11:58.880 --> 3:12:00.800
 was that if I talk with him,

3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:02.960
 a lot of people would be upset with me

3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:04.400
 for giving him a platform.

3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:06.400
 Yeah, I think he's on that edge

3:12:06.400 --> 3:12:10.560
 where they want to read him out of what is acceptable discourse.

3:12:10.560 --> 3:12:12.160
 What's his most controversial...

3:12:12.720 --> 3:12:14.400
 I mean, you keep mentioning the tanks.

3:12:14.400 --> 3:12:16.160
 Is that the most controversial viewpoint?

3:12:16.160 --> 3:12:17.520
 Does he have a race thing?

3:12:17.520 --> 3:12:21.200
 No, the alt right doesn't particularly like him in many ways

3:12:21.200 --> 3:12:23.200
 because he's not a big race thing.

3:12:23.200 --> 3:12:26.000
 I don't know what would be his most controversial view,

3:12:26.800 --> 3:12:27.520
 to be honest.

3:12:27.520 --> 3:12:31.040
 I think because he is radical

3:12:31.040 --> 3:12:33.760
 in terms of his analysis of culture,

3:12:33.760 --> 3:12:35.600
 anytime someone's a radical, that is dangerous.

3:12:35.600 --> 3:12:36.880
 Yeah, it's dangerous.

3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:38.160
 Okay, book...

3:12:38.160 --> 3:12:38.960
 So, that's one...

3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:39.920
 The Fountainhead.

3:12:39.920 --> 3:12:41.120
 The Fountainhead.

3:12:41.120 --> 3:12:41.600
 Which is a...

3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:43.200
 I would say...

3:12:43.200 --> 3:12:44.240
 Not Atlas Shrug?

3:12:44.240 --> 3:12:46.000
 No, and if you read Atlas Shrug

3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:46.960
 before reading The Fountainhead,

3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:48.480
 you're doing yourself enormous to service.

3:12:48.480 --> 3:12:49.840
 Don't you dare do it.

3:12:49.840 --> 3:12:51.280
 On the philosophical because...

3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:52.000
 Every level.

3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:52.960
 On every level.

3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:54.400
 The Fountainhead's a better novel.

3:12:54.400 --> 3:12:55.600
 The Fountainhead's superfluous

3:12:55.600 --> 3:12:56.960
 if you read Atlas Shrug first.

3:12:56.960 --> 3:12:59.600
 Fountainhead's about psychology and ethics.

3:13:00.400 --> 3:13:02.080
 It does not have to do with her politics

3:13:02.080 --> 3:13:03.680
 other than its implications.

3:13:03.680 --> 3:13:05.040
 So, it's by far the superior book.

3:13:05.840 --> 3:13:06.880
 The third one...

3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:09.360
 Oh, this is a good one question.

3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:09.840
 Let me see.

3:13:09.840 --> 3:13:12.560
 Well, there's so many good books out there that I love.

3:13:13.600 --> 3:13:14.400
 I'm going to...

3:13:14.400 --> 3:13:16.160
 This is not really my third choice,

3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:17.840
 but I'll throw it out there because I...

3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:21.040
 This is such an important worldview,

3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:22.640
 especially for people on the right.

3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:24.160
 Are you virtue signaling?

3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:25.440
 No, this is counter signaling.

3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:27.680
 Thaddeus Russell's book,

3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:29.600
 A Renegade History of the United States.

3:13:29.600 --> 3:13:33.200
 His thesis is that it's the degenerates

3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:34.720
 that give us all freedom.

3:13:35.920 --> 3:13:37.520
 And things like prostitutes,

3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:38.480
 things like madams,

3:13:38.480 --> 3:13:39.520
 things like slaves,

3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:41.520
 things like immigrants.

3:13:41.520 --> 3:13:43.760
 Because they were so low status,

3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:45.840
 they could get away with things

3:13:45.840 --> 3:13:47.840
 that then people who are higher status demanded

3:13:47.840 --> 3:13:48.800
 and so on and so forth.

3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:53.920
 So, I think that thesis and it really has extreme consequences

3:13:53.920 --> 3:13:57.520
 in thinking.

3:13:57.520 --> 3:13:59.120
 Oh, and Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind.

3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:01.040
 Those are the four.

3:14:02.560 --> 3:14:03.360
 Is that his best?

3:14:03.360 --> 3:14:04.560
 I haven't read any of his stuff.

3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:05.920
 The Righteous Mind is the only one you want.

3:14:05.920 --> 3:14:06.240
 Okay.

3:14:08.480 --> 3:14:09.600
 That was four, but of course...

3:14:10.160 --> 3:14:12.000
 Forget Thaddeus Russell, we'll put Haidt in there.

3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:12.720
 Of course he would.

3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:15.520
 No, forget Thaddeus, those are the three.

3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:18.720
 So, we talked about love.

3:14:18.720 --> 3:14:21.440
 Let me ask you the other question I'm obsessed with.

3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:25.600
 So, do you ponder your own mortality?

3:14:26.160 --> 3:14:29.680
 I do a lot, especially now that I'm an uncle,

3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:32.480
 especially now that I have these younger people that I mentor.

3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:35.920
 I was just yesterday, my friend John Gurgus,

3:14:35.920 --> 3:14:37.520
 who did my theme song for my podcast,

3:14:37.520 --> 3:14:40.720
 who did the book cover for Dear Reader,

3:14:40.720 --> 3:14:42.800
 who's the most talented person I know.

3:14:42.800 --> 3:14:45.280
 His song came on, The iPod at the Gym.

3:14:45.280 --> 3:14:46.320
 And I almost messaged him.

3:14:46.320 --> 3:14:48.720
 I go, you know, one day one of us is going to bury the other

3:14:48.720 --> 3:14:50.240
 and it's going to be really sad.

3:14:50.240 --> 3:14:51.920
 And I thought about that and it was kind of just like,

3:14:51.920 --> 3:14:53.120
 oh man, that's really going to suck.

3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:56.160
 And you know, I don't know which scenario would be better.

3:14:56.160 --> 3:14:58.400
 Like, I will be very sad if he's gone.

3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:00.000
 I'm sure he'll be very sad if I'm gone.

3:15:01.280 --> 3:15:03.360
 I mean, are you afraid of it?

3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:07.360
 No, you know, Rand had this quote about how

3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:09.440
 I won't die, the world will end.

3:15:10.240 --> 3:15:15.360
 So, I've had enough experiences that I am, I've really,

3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:18.640
 at this point, everything's icing on the cake.

3:15:18.640 --> 3:15:21.840
 So, if I were to kill you at the end of this podcast,

3:15:22.560 --> 3:15:23.600
 it would feel painless.

3:15:24.240 --> 3:15:25.120
 That would be okay.

3:15:25.120 --> 3:15:25.680
 Yeah.

3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:26.400
 You know why?

3:15:26.400 --> 3:15:27.920
 Does anyone know you're here by the way?

3:15:29.760 --> 3:15:30.240
 You know why?

3:15:30.240 --> 3:15:31.200
 I was asking for a friend.

3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:32.560
 Here's why.

3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:33.120
 Yeah.

3:15:33.120 --> 3:15:33.920
 There's that wit.

3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:35.680
 Save that for Twitter, Lex.

3:15:37.200 --> 3:15:38.160
 Did they call you Sasha?

3:15:38.880 --> 3:15:40.080
 No, I'm Liosha.

3:15:40.080 --> 3:15:40.400
 Liosha.

3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:41.840
 Oh, that's my sister's husband.

3:15:41.840 --> 3:15:42.400
 Okay.

3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:47.040
 So, here's why I strongly believe,

3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:49.360
 and this is a very kind of Jewish perspective,

3:15:49.360 --> 3:15:51.280
 that you just have to leave the world a little bit better

3:15:51.280 --> 3:15:52.160
 than you found it,

3:15:52.160 --> 3:15:53.680
 that all you could do is move the needle a little.

3:15:54.240 --> 3:15:57.200
 And one of the things I set out to do with Dear Reader,

3:15:57.200 --> 3:15:58.720
 my book on North Korea,

3:15:58.720 --> 3:16:00.320
 I said, I was at a point in my career

3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:01.840
 where I could do something to make a difference

3:16:01.840 --> 3:16:03.760
 instead of just writing like coauthoring books

3:16:03.760 --> 3:16:04.320
 for celebrities,

3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:05.200
 which I'm very proud of,

3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:06.800
 but you know, are neither here nor there.

3:16:07.360 --> 3:16:09.600
 And I thought, all right, I know how to tell stories.

3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:12.000
 I know how to inform people and 110 people.

3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:14.400
 If I move the needle in America, cares,

3:16:14.400 --> 3:16:15.600
 we got a really good here.

3:16:15.600 --> 3:16:18.240
 If I move the needle in North Korea a little bit,

3:16:18.240 --> 3:16:20.080
 the cost benefits through the roof.

3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:21.680
 I never thought of that actually.

3:16:22.240 --> 3:16:24.720
 I never thought of Dear Reader from that perspective.

3:16:24.720 --> 3:16:26.720
 So, when I set out to write it,

3:16:26.720 --> 3:16:28.480
 I'm like, okay, what can I do?

3:16:28.480 --> 3:16:30.720
 I'm not going to be able to liberate the North Korean regime.

3:16:30.720 --> 3:16:33.760
 What I can do is the camera right now

3:16:33.760 --> 3:16:35.520
 is focused on at the time Kim Jong Il,

3:16:35.520 --> 3:16:36.800
 not Kim Jong Un.

3:16:36.800 --> 3:16:38.800
 And I can do just this a little bit.

3:16:38.800 --> 3:16:42.560
 And I go, behind that guy who you think is funny clown,

3:16:42.560 --> 3:16:44.320
 there's millions of dead people.

3:16:44.320 --> 3:16:46.160
 There's children being starved.

3:16:46.160 --> 3:16:47.680
 There's people who are performing

3:16:47.680 --> 3:16:49.440
 because they have a gun to their kid's head.

3:16:49.440 --> 3:16:50.880
 And if someone put a gun to your kid's head,

3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:52.560
 you'd put on those dancing shoes real quick.

3:16:53.120 --> 3:16:57.280
 And I and others have managed to change the conversation

3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:00.560
 about North Korea in terms of look at those silly buffoons

3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:02.160
 to those poor people.

3:17:02.800 --> 3:17:05.440
 So, the fact that that little thing I can say

3:17:05.440 --> 3:17:09.280
 with a straight face, I did, doesn't make me a great person,

3:17:09.280 --> 3:17:12.960
 but it does make me someone who if I have to go tomorrow,

3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:16.800
 I can say I did a little bit to make the world a better place.

3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:19.840
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

3:17:20.960 --> 3:17:23.040
 I think the meaning of life is...

3:17:26.240 --> 3:17:26.880
 Why are we here?

3:17:27.440 --> 3:17:29.440
 Oh, well, I'm a Camus person.

3:17:29.440 --> 3:17:31.280
 So, I'll give the Camus answer.

3:17:31.280 --> 3:17:33.040
 So, there's two types of people.

3:17:33.600 --> 3:17:35.040
 Those who know how to use binary, no.

3:17:38.560 --> 3:17:40.240
 Thanks for relating to the audience.

3:17:40.240 --> 3:17:43.040
 One, one, one, zero, zero, one, two, two.

3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:45.680
 Down vote.

3:17:47.280 --> 3:17:49.280
 What kind of radical freak is this, Lex?

3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:53.200
 So, and I use this example in my forthcoming book.

3:17:53.200 --> 3:17:55.920
 You go into a countryside, a mountainside,

3:17:55.920 --> 3:17:58.800
 and you see a blank canvas on an easel.

3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:00.880
 And one kind of mentality goes, this is...

3:18:01.680 --> 3:18:02.720
 It's just a blank canvas.

3:18:02.720 --> 3:18:03.360
 This is stupid.

3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:04.800
 This is what am I looking at?

3:18:04.800 --> 3:18:07.520
 And the other type goes, what a great opportunity.

3:18:07.520 --> 3:18:09.680
 I'm in this beautiful space.

3:18:09.680 --> 3:18:11.360
 I have this entire canvas to paint.

3:18:11.360 --> 3:18:13.200
 I could do anything I want with it.

3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:16.000
 So, I am very much of that type two person.

3:18:16.960 --> 3:18:21.840
 And I hope others start to think of life in that way.

3:18:21.840 --> 3:18:23.600
 You and I have both been more successful

3:18:23.600 --> 3:18:25.760
 than we expected to, especially growing up.

3:18:25.760 --> 3:18:27.600
 And in ways we did not expect.

3:18:28.480 --> 3:18:32.240
 And when you're young, you are so intent on driving the car.

3:18:32.880 --> 3:18:35.040
 And after a certain point, you realize it's not about

3:18:35.040 --> 3:18:37.120
 driving the car, it's you're being a surfer.

3:18:37.120 --> 3:18:39.040
 That you can only control this little board.

3:18:39.040 --> 3:18:40.880
 And you have no idea where the waves will take you.

3:18:40.880 --> 3:18:41.920
 And sometimes you're going to fall down

3:18:41.920 --> 3:18:42.960
 and sometimes you're going to suck

3:18:42.960 --> 3:18:44.640
 and you're going to swallow some salt water.

3:18:44.640 --> 3:18:47.200
 But at a certain point, you stop trying to drive.

3:18:47.200 --> 3:18:48.640
 And you're like, this is freaking awesome

3:18:48.640 --> 3:18:49.760
 and I have no idea where it's going to go.

3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:54.800
 Beautifully put, I know I speak for a lot of people.

3:18:54.800 --> 3:18:59.520
 First of all, everyone loves the game you play on the internet.

3:18:59.520 --> 3:19:00.080
 It's fun.

3:19:00.080 --> 3:19:00.560
 Not everyone.

3:19:00.560 --> 3:19:02.000
 You make the world not everyone.

3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:04.240
 Today, they came from the yard.

3:19:04.240 --> 3:19:07.360
 But it makes the world seem fun.

3:19:07.360 --> 3:19:11.600
 And especially in this dark time, it's much appreciated.

3:19:11.600 --> 3:19:14.480
 And we can't wait till the next book and the many to come

3:19:14.480 --> 3:19:17.360
 and to hopefully many more Joe Rogan appearances.

3:19:17.360 --> 3:19:19.280
 You guys do some great magic together.

3:19:19.280 --> 3:19:19.600
 It's fun.

3:19:19.600 --> 3:19:25.360
 It's, yeah, you're one of my favorite guests on this show.

3:19:25.360 --> 3:19:28.480
 So I can't wait, especially if you can make it before the election.

3:19:29.680 --> 3:19:31.280
 Thanks so much for making today happen.

3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:32.640
 I'm glad you came down.

3:19:32.640 --> 3:19:34.240
 You're awesome.

3:19:34.240 --> 3:19:34.960
 Thank you so much.

3:19:34.960 --> 3:19:35.760
 What a great compliment.

 Conservatism is progressivism driving the speed limit.
