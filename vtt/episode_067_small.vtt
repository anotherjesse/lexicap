00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
 The following is a conversation with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize winner in economics,

00:04.880 --> 00:11.120
 Professor Cuny, and columnist at the New York Times. His academic work centers around international

00:11.120 --> 00:18.480
 economics, economic geography, liquidity traps, and currency crises. But he also is an outspoken

00:18.480 --> 00:24.880
 writer and commentator on the intersection of modern day politics and economics, which places him

00:24.880 --> 00:31.360
 in the middle of the tense, divisive, modern day political discourse. If you have clicked dislike

00:31.360 --> 00:36.400
 on this video and started writing a comment of derision before listening to the conversation,

00:36.400 --> 00:41.440
 I humbly ask that you please unsubscribe from this channel and from this podcast,

00:41.440 --> 00:46.320
 not because you're a conservative, a libertarian, a liberal, a socialist, and anarchist,

00:46.320 --> 00:52.560
 but because you're not open to new ideas, at least in this case, especially at its most difficult,

00:52.560 --> 00:58.560
 from people with whom you largely disagree. I do my best to stay away from politics of the day,

00:59.280 --> 01:04.800
 because political discourse is filled with a degree of emotion and self assured certainty

01:04.800 --> 01:11.840
 that to me is not conducive to exploring questions that nobody knows the definitive right answer to.

01:12.560 --> 01:17.920
 The role of government, the impact of automation, the regulation of tech, the medical system,

01:17.920 --> 01:25.520
 guns, war, trade, foreign policy are not easy topics and have no clear answers, despite the

01:25.520 --> 01:31.760
 certainty of the so called experts, the pundits, the trolls, the media personalities, and the

01:31.760 --> 01:40.080
 conspiracy theorists. Please listen, empathize, and allow yourself to explore ideas with curiosity

01:40.080 --> 01:45.520
 and without judgment and without derision. I will speak with many more economists and

01:45.520 --> 01:50.480
 political thinkers, trying to stay away from the political battles of the day and instead

01:50.480 --> 01:57.280
 look at the long arc of history and the lessons it reveals. In this, I appreciate your patience

01:57.280 --> 02:04.800
 and support. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe by YouTube,

 with me on Twitter. I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction. I'll do one or two

02:19.600 --> 02:24.320
 minutes after introducing the episode and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of

02:24.320 --> 02:29.040
 the conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:30.320 --> 02:35.840
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. Cash App lets

02:35.840 --> 02:41.600
 you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with fractional share trading,

02:41.600 --> 02:45.840
 allowing you to buy $1 worth of a stock no matter what the stock price is.

02:46.560 --> 02:52.240
 Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

 Get Cash App from the App Store and Google Play and use the code LEX Podcast. You'll get $10

02:59.760 --> 03:05.120
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, one of my favorite organizations that is helping to

03:05.120 --> 03:11.520
 advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. Since Cash App does

03:11.520 --> 03:17.920
 fractional share trading, let me say that to me it's a fascinating concept. The order execution

03:17.920 --> 03:22.880
 algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of fractional orders for the

03:22.880 --> 03:29.360
 investor is an algorithmic marvel. So big props to the Cash App engineers for that. I like it when

03:29.360 --> 03:34.960
 tech teams solve complicated problems to provide, in the end, a simple effortless interface that

03:34.960 --> 03:41.520
 abstracts away all the details of the underlying algorithm. And now, here's my conversation with

03:41.520 --> 03:48.240
 Paul Krugman. What does a perfect world, a utopia, from an economics perspective look like?

03:50.000 --> 03:56.400
 Wow, I don't really, I don't believe in perfection. I mean, somebody once said

03:56.400 --> 04:06.400
 that his ideal was slightly imaginary Sweden. I mean, I like an economy that has a really high

04:06.400 --> 04:14.720
 safety net for people, good environmental regulation, and something that's kind of like

04:16.080 --> 04:22.240
 some of the better run countries in the world, but with fixing all of the smaller things that

04:22.240 --> 04:27.040
 are wrong with them. What about wealth distribution? Well, obviously, you know, total equality is

04:28.720 --> 04:32.480
 neither possible nor, I think, especially desirable. But I think you want one where,

04:33.360 --> 04:41.120
 basically one where nobody is hurting and where everybody lives in the same material universe.

04:41.120 --> 04:47.440
 Everybody is basically living in the same society. So I think it's a bad thing to have people who

04:47.440 --> 04:52.240
 are so wealthy that they're really not in the same world as the rest of us. What about competition?

04:52.240 --> 04:59.040
 Do you see the value of competition and what maybe its limits? Oh, competition is great when it

04:59.040 --> 05:05.200
 can work. I mean, there's a, I remember, I'm old enough to remember when there was only one phone

05:05.200 --> 05:13.920
 company and there was really limited choice. And I think the arrival of multiple phone carriers

05:13.920 --> 05:21.440
 and all that has actually been a really good thing. And that's true across many areas. But

05:21.440 --> 05:28.080
 not every industry is, not every activity is suitable for competition. So there are some things

05:28.080 --> 05:35.760
 like healthcare where competition actually doesn't work. And so it's not one size fits all.

05:35.760 --> 05:41.600
 That's interesting. Why does competition not work in healthcare?

05:41.600 --> 05:46.320
 Oh, there's a long list. I mean, there's a famous paper by Kenneth Arrow from 1963,

05:46.320 --> 05:50.160
 which still holds up very well, where he kind of runs down the list of things you need for

05:50.160 --> 05:55.600
 competition to work well, basically both sides to every transaction being well informed,

05:56.480 --> 06:02.880
 having the ability to make intelligent decisions, understanding what's going on,

06:02.880 --> 06:06.480
 and healthcare fails on every dimension that you did.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.480
 Healthcare, so not health insurance, healthcare.

06:08.480 --> 06:12.240
 Well, both healthcare and health insurance, health insurance being part of it. But no,

06:12.240 --> 06:18.720
 health insurance is really the idea that there's effective competition between health insurers

06:18.720 --> 06:25.040
 is wrong in healthcare. I mean, the idea that you can comparison shop for major surgery is just,

06:26.960 --> 06:32.160
 to when people say things like that, do you wonder, are you living in the same world I'm

06:32.160 --> 06:38.160
 living in? You know, the piece of well informed, that was always an interesting piece for me,

06:38.160 --> 06:45.280
 just observing as an outsider, because so much beautiful, such a beautiful world as possible

06:45.280 --> 06:50.400
 when everybody's well informed. My question for you is, how hard is it to be well informed about

06:50.400 --> 06:56.320
 anything, whether it's healthcare or any kind of purchasing decisions or just life in general

06:56.320 --> 07:02.240
 in this world? Oh, information, you know, it varies hugely. I mean, there's more information

07:02.240 --> 07:10.160
 at your fingertips than ever before in history. The trouble is, first of all, that some of that

07:10.160 --> 07:17.120
 information isn't true. So it's really hard. And then some of it is just too hard to understand.

07:17.120 --> 07:24.400
 So if I'm buying a car, I can actually probably do a pretty good job of looking up, you know,

07:24.400 --> 07:28.560
 going to consumer reports, reviews, you can get a pretty good idea of what you're getting when

07:28.560 --> 07:38.480
 you get a car. If I'm going in for surgery, first of all, you know, fairly often it happens when

07:38.480 --> 07:44.560
 without you're able being able to plan it. But also, there's a re medical school takes many,

07:44.560 --> 07:50.480
 many years and going on the internet for some advice is not usually a very good substitute.

07:51.760 --> 07:56.480
 So speaking about news and not being able to trust certain sources of information,

07:56.480 --> 08:02.880
 how much disagreement is there about, I mentioned utopia perfection in the beginning, but how much

08:02.880 --> 08:09.280
 disagreement is there about what utopia looks like? Or is most of the disagreement simply about

08:09.280 --> 08:18.800
 the path to get there? Oh, I think there's two levels of disagreement. One, maybe not utopia,

08:18.800 --> 08:24.720
 but justice. You know, what is a just society? And that's, there are different views. I mean,

08:24.720 --> 08:30.640
 I teach my students that there are, you know, broadly speaking, two views of justice. One,

08:30.640 --> 08:39.840
 it focuses on outcomes. You ask, it's a just society is the one you would choose if you were

08:39.840 --> 08:46.000
 trying to, what the one that you would choose to live in, if you didn't know who you were going to

08:46.000 --> 08:52.560
 be, that's kind of John Rawls. And the other focuses on process that justice society is one in

08:52.560 --> 08:58.480
 which there is no coercion, except we're absolutely necessary. And there's no,

08:59.600 --> 09:04.000
 there's no objective way to choose between those. I'm pretty much a Rawlsian. And I think many

09:04.000 --> 09:09.680
 people are. But anyway, there's, so there's a legitimate dispute about what we mean by a

09:09.680 --> 09:15.920
 just society anyway. But then there's also a lot of disputes about what actually works.

09:15.920 --> 09:25.360
 There's a range of legitimate dispute. I mean, any card carrying economist will say that incentives

09:25.360 --> 09:31.360
 matter. But how much do they matter? How much does a higher tax rate actually deter people from

09:31.360 --> 09:40.480
 working? How much does a stronger safety net actually lead people to get lazy? I have a

09:40.480 --> 09:47.680
 pretty strong view that the evidence points to conclusions that are considerably to the left

09:47.680 --> 09:54.880
 of where most of our politicians are. But there is legitimate room for disagreement on those things.

09:56.640 --> 10:03.040
 So you've mentioned outcomes. What are some metrics you think about that you keep in mind,

10:03.040 --> 10:08.400
 like the genie coefficient, but really anything that measures how good we're doing,

10:08.400 --> 10:11.440
 whatever we're trying to do, what are the metrics you keep an eye on?

10:11.440 --> 10:16.560
 Well, I'm actually, I'm not a fan of the genie coefficient, not because it's anything.

10:16.560 --> 10:21.120
 What is the genie coefficient? Yeah, the genie coefficient is a measure of inequality.

10:21.600 --> 10:28.000
 And it is commonly used because it's a single number. It usually tracks with other measures,

10:28.000 --> 10:34.880
 but the trouble is there's no sort of natural interpretation of it. You ask me what,

10:34.880 --> 10:43.760
 what does a society with a genie of 0.45 look like as opposed to a society with a genie of 0.25?

10:44.320 --> 10:51.200
 And I can kind of tell you, you know, 0.25 is Denmark and 0.45 is Brazil, but it's,

10:51.200 --> 10:58.640
 that's a really, there's no sort of easy way to do that mapping. I mean, I look at things like,

10:58.640 --> 11:06.240
 what is, first of all, things like what is the income of the median family?

11:07.920 --> 11:14.080
 What is the income of the top 1%? How many people are in poverty by various measures of poverty?

11:15.040 --> 11:18.640
 And then I think you want to look at questions like,

11:18.640 --> 11:30.080
 how healthy are people? How was life expectancy doing? And how satisfied are people with their

11:30.080 --> 11:35.120
 lives? Because there is, that sounds like a squishy number, not so much happiness,

11:35.120 --> 11:38.160
 it turns out that life satisfaction is a better measure than happiness.

11:39.200 --> 11:45.760
 But life satisfaction, that varies quite a lot. And I think it's meaningful if not

11:45.760 --> 11:53.760
 too rigorous to say, look, according to that kind of, according to polling, people in Denmark are

11:53.760 --> 11:58.640
 pretty satisfied with their lives and people in the United States, not so much so.

11:59.360 --> 12:03.360
 And of course, Sweden wins every time. No, actually, Denmark wins these days.

12:04.160 --> 12:07.200
 Denmark and Norway tend to win these days. Sweden doesn't do badly, but

12:07.200 --> 12:15.360
 none of these are perfect. But look, I think by and large,

12:17.360 --> 12:21.920
 there's a bit of a pornography test. How do you know a decent society? Well,

12:21.920 --> 12:25.840
 you kind of know it when you see it. Right. Where does America stand on that?

12:28.640 --> 12:35.120
 Our society, there are a lot of virtues to America, but there's a level of harshness,

12:35.120 --> 12:44.080
 brutality, an ability for somebody who just has bad luck to fall off the edge that is really,

12:46.720 --> 12:51.760
 shouldn't be happening in a country as rich as ours. So we have somehow managed to produce a

12:53.120 --> 12:59.360
 crueler society than almost any other wealthy country for no good reason.

13:00.240 --> 13:04.480
 What do you think is lacking in the safety net that the United States provides? You said

13:04.480 --> 13:12.320
 there's a harshness to it. And what are the benefits and maybe limits of a safety net in a

13:12.320 --> 13:17.920
 country like ours? Well, every other advanced country has some universal guarantee of adequate

13:17.920 --> 13:25.680
 health care. The United States is the only place where citizens can actually fail to get basic

13:25.680 --> 13:31.920
 health care because they can't afford it. It's not hard to do. Everybody else does it,

13:31.920 --> 13:36.400
 but we don't. We've gotten a little bit better at it than we were, but still, that's a big deal.

13:37.520 --> 13:49.200
 We have remarkably weak support for children. Most countries have substantial safety.

13:49.200 --> 13:56.000
 Parents of young children get much more support elsewhere. They get often nothing in the U.S.

13:56.000 --> 14:06.480
 U.S. We have limited care for people, long term care for the elderly is a very hit and

14:06.480 --> 14:14.880
 miss thing. But I think that the really big issues are that we don't take care of children

14:14.880 --> 14:20.000
 who make the mistake of having the wrong parents and we don't take care of people who make the

14:20.000 --> 14:26.720
 mistake of getting sick. And those are things that a rich country should be doing. Sorry for

14:26.720 --> 14:33.200
 sort of a difficult question, but you just said kind of feels like the right thing to do in terms

14:33.200 --> 14:40.560
 of a just society. But is it also good for the economic health of a society to take care of

14:41.760 --> 14:44.800
 the people who are the unfortunate members of society?

14:44.800 --> 14:52.800
 By and large, it looks like the doing the right thing in terms of justice is also the

14:52.800 --> 14:59.200
 right thing in terms of economics. If we're talking about a society that has extremely high

14:59.200 --> 15:05.760
 tax rates that deter, you know, remove all incentives to provide a safety net that is so

15:05.760 --> 15:13.120
 generous that why bother working or striving, that could be a problem. But I don't actually

15:13.120 --> 15:18.240
 know any society that looks like that even even in European countries with very generous safety

15:18.240 --> 15:25.360
 nets people work and then innovate and do all of these things. And there's a lot of evidence now

15:25.360 --> 15:32.880
 that lacking those basics is actually destructive that children who grow up without adequate health

15:32.880 --> 15:39.680
 care without adequate nutrition are developmentally challenged. They don't live up to their potential

15:39.680 --> 15:47.280
 as adults. So the United States actually probably pays a price. We're harsh, we're cruel, and we

15:47.280 --> 15:53.200
 actually make ourselves poorer as a society, not just the individuals by being so harsh and cruel.

15:54.160 --> 16:00.800
 Okay, so invisible hand, Smith, where does that fit in? The power of just people acting selfishly

16:00.800 --> 16:10.080
 and somehow everything taking care of itself to where, you know, the economy grows, nobody,

16:10.080 --> 16:17.200
 there's no cruelty, no injustice that the markets regulate themselves. What is their

16:17.200 --> 16:23.280
 power to that idea and what are its limits? There's a lot of power to that. I mean, there's a

16:23.280 --> 16:31.840
 reason why I don't think sensible people want the government running steel mills or they want the

16:31.840 --> 16:43.440
 government to own the farms, right? The markets are a pretty effective way of getting incentives

16:43.440 --> 16:47.600
 aligned of inducing people to do stuff that works and the invisible hand is saying that, you know,

16:47.600 --> 16:53.360
 people, farmers aren't growing crops because they want to feed people, they're growing crops because

16:53.360 --> 16:57.520
 they can make money by it, but it actually turns out to be a pretty good way of getting

16:59.040 --> 17:06.400
 agricultural products grown. So the invisible hand is an important part, but there's nothing

17:06.400 --> 17:12.240
 mystical about it. It's a mechanism, it's a way to organize economic activity, which works well,

17:12.240 --> 17:17.120
 given a bunch of preconditions, which means that it actually works well for agriculture,

17:17.120 --> 17:23.920
 it works well for manufacturing, it works well for many services, it doesn't work well for healthcare,

17:23.920 --> 17:30.400
 it doesn't work well for education. So there are, you know, we, having a society which is kind of

17:30.400 --> 17:38.480
 three quarters invisible hand and one quarter visible hand seems to be something, something on

17:38.480 --> 17:44.160
 that order seems to be the balance that works best. It's just don't want to, you don't want to

17:44.160 --> 17:52.080
 romanticize or make something mystical out of it. It's just, this is one way to organize stuff that

17:52.080 --> 17:57.280
 happens to have broad but not universal application. So then forgive me for romanticizing it, but it

17:57.280 --> 18:04.400
 does seem pretty magical that, you know, I kind of have an intuitive understanding of what happens

18:04.400 --> 18:08.640
 when you have like five, 10, maybe even a hundred people together, the dynamics of that. But the

18:08.640 --> 18:14.560
 fact that these large society of people for the most part acting in a self interested way, and

18:14.560 --> 18:20.960
 maybe electing representatives for themselves, that it all kind of seems to work, it's pretty

18:20.960 --> 18:29.040
 magical. The fact that there's, you know, that right now there's a wide assortment of fresh

18:29.040 --> 18:39.440
 fruit and vegetables in the local markets up and down the street. You know, who's planning that?

18:39.440 --> 18:46.480
 And the answer is nobody. That's the invisible hand at work and that's great. And that's a lesson

18:46.480 --> 18:56.080
 that Adam Smith figured out more than 200 years ago. And it continues to apply. But, you know,

18:56.080 --> 19:02.640
 even Adam Smith has a section in his book about why it's important to regulate banks. So the

19:02.640 --> 19:07.440
 invisible hand has its limits. Yeah. And that example is actually a powerful one in terms of

19:07.440 --> 19:13.120
 the supermarket of fruit. That was my experience coming from Russia, from the Soviet Union is when

19:13.120 --> 19:19.600
 I first entered the supermarket and just seeing the assortment of fruit, bananas. So I don't think

19:19.600 --> 19:25.360
 I've seen bananas before, first of all, but just the selection of fresh fruit was just mind blowing

19:25.360 --> 19:32.400
 and it's beyond words. And the fact that, like you said, I don't know what made that happen.

19:32.400 --> 19:40.080
 Well, there is some magic to the market. But as showing my age, but you know, the old movie

19:40.080 --> 19:43.440
 quote, sometimes the magic works and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to have some idea of when

19:43.440 --> 19:51.040
 it doesn't. So how do you get regulation, right? What can government at its best do? Government

19:51.040 --> 19:57.520
 strangely enough, in this country today, seems to get a bad rap. Like everyone seems to,

19:59.040 --> 20:03.840
 everybody's against the government. Yeah. Well, a lot of money has been spent on making people hate

20:03.840 --> 20:08.800
 the government. But the reality is government does some things pretty well. I mean, we,

20:11.280 --> 20:16.560
 government does health insurance pretty well. So much so. I mean, given our anti government bias,

20:16.560 --> 20:20.480
 it really is true that there are people out there saying, don't let the government get its hands

20:20.480 --> 20:27.840
 on Medicare. So government, people actually love the government health insurance program far more

20:27.840 --> 20:38.160
 than they love private health insurance. Basic education. It turns out that your local public

20:38.160 --> 20:44.880
 high school is the right place to have students trained and private for certainly for profit

20:44.880 --> 20:56.400
 education is a by and large a nightmare of ripoffs and grift and people not getting what they

20:56.400 --> 21:02.640
 thought they were paying for. It's a judgment case. And it's funny, there are things, I mean,

21:02.640 --> 21:10.320
 everybody talks, talks about the DMV as being, you know, do you want the economy? Actually,

21:10.320 --> 21:15.040
 my experience is that the DMV have always been positive. Maybe I'm just going to the right DMVs.

21:15.040 --> 21:22.480
 But in fact, a lot of government works pretty well. So it, you'd have to, to some extent,

21:22.480 --> 21:27.680
 you can do these things on a priori grounds. You can talk about the logic of why healthcare is not

21:27.680 --> 21:32.400
 going to be handled well by the market. But partly it's just experience. We tried, or at least some

21:32.400 --> 21:37.440
 countries have tried nationalizing their steel industries. That didn't go well. But we've tried

21:37.440 --> 21:41.360
 privatizing education and that didn't go well. So you find out what works.

21:43.120 --> 21:49.680
 What about this new world of tech? How do you see, what do you think works for tech? Is it more

21:49.680 --> 21:56.560
 regulation or less regulation? There are some things that need more regulation. I mean, we're

21:56.560 --> 22:08.160
 finding out that the world of social media is one in which competitive forces aren't working very

22:08.160 --> 22:13.760
 well and trusting the companies to regulate themselves isn't working very well. But I'm

22:13.760 --> 22:18.720
 on the whole, a tech skeptic, not in the sense that I think the tech doesn't work and it doesn't

22:18.720 --> 22:23.760
 do stuff. But the idea that we're living through greater technological change than ever before

22:23.760 --> 22:31.680
 is really an illusion. Ever since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, we've had a series

22:31.680 --> 22:39.440
 of ethical shifts in the nature of work and in the kinds of jobs that are available. And it's

22:39.440 --> 22:47.120
 not at all clear that what's happening now is any bigger or faster or harder to cope with than

22:47.120 --> 22:55.680
 past shocks. It is a popular notion in today's sort of public discourse that automation is going to

22:55.680 --> 23:01.520
 have a huge impact on the job market now. Yeah, there is something, something transformational

23:01.520 --> 23:09.920
 happening now. Can you talk about that? Maybe elaborate a little bit more. Do you not see

23:09.920 --> 23:17.600
 the software revolutions happening now with machine learning, availability of data, that

23:17.600 --> 23:25.200
 kind of automation being able to sort of process, clean, find patterns in data. And you don't see

23:25.200 --> 23:32.480
 that disrupting any one sector to a point where there's a huge loss of jobs. There may be some

23:32.480 --> 23:37.200
 things. I mean, actually, translators, there's really reduced demand for translators because

23:37.200 --> 23:44.960
 we've, machine translation ain't perfect, but it ain't bad. There are some kinds of things that

23:44.960 --> 23:55.680
 are changed. But it's not, overall productivity growth has actually been slow in recent years.

23:55.680 --> 24:01.600
 It's been much slower than in some past periods. So the idea that automation is taking away all

24:01.600 --> 24:06.800
 the jobs, the counterpart would be that we would be able to produce stuff with many fewer

24:06.800 --> 24:11.760
 workers than before. And that's not happening. There are a few isolated sectors. There are some

24:11.760 --> 24:18.960
 kinds of jobs that are going away, but that keeps on happening. I mean, New York City used to have

24:19.520 --> 24:25.920
 thousands and thousands of longshoremen taking stuff off ships and putting them on ships.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.920
 They're almost all gone now. Now you have these giant cranes taking containers on and off ships

24:33.920 --> 24:42.240
 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. That's not robots. It doesn't sound high tech, but it actually

24:42.800 --> 24:49.120
 pretty much destroyed an occupation. Well, you know, it wasn't fun for the longshoremen to say

24:49.120 --> 24:57.680
 the least. But it's not, we coped, we moved on, and that sort of thing happens all the time.

24:57.680 --> 25:05.600
 You mean farmers? We used to be a nation which was mostly farmers. There are now very few farmers

25:05.600 --> 25:13.360
 left. The end reason is not that we've stopped eating. It's that farming has become so efficient

25:13.360 --> 25:18.080
 that we don't need a lot of farmers and we coped with that too. So the idea that there's something

25:19.120 --> 25:22.800
 qualitatively different about what's happening now so far isn't true.

25:22.800 --> 25:28.800
 So yeah, your intuition is there is going to be a loss of jobs, but it's just the thing that

25:28.800 --> 25:33.680
 just continues. There's nothing qualitatively different about this moment. Some jobs will

25:33.680 --> 25:38.800
 be lost, others will be created, as has always been the case so far. Maybe there's a singularity.

25:38.800 --> 25:44.880
 Maybe there's a moment when the machines get smarter than we are and SkyTech kills us all

25:44.880 --> 25:49.840
 or something. But that's not visible in anything we're seeing now.

25:49.840 --> 25:54.160
 You mentioned the metric of productivity. Could you explain that a little bit? Because

25:54.160 --> 25:59.360
 it's a really interesting one. I've heard you mentioned that before, the new connection with

25:59.360 --> 26:04.640
 automation. So what is that metric? And if there is something qualitatively different,

26:04.640 --> 26:10.480
 what should we see in that metric? Well, okay, productivity, first of all, production. We do

26:10.480 --> 26:17.360
 have a measure of the economy's total production, real GDP, which is itself, it's a little bit

26:17.360 --> 26:23.600
 of a construct because it's, quite literally, it's adding apples and oranges. So we have to add

26:23.600 --> 26:28.720
 together various things, which we basically do by using market prices, but we try to adjust for

26:28.720 --> 26:34.000
 inflation. But it's kind of, it's a reasonable measure of how much the economy is producing.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.400
 Is it goods and, sorry to interrupt, is it goods and services?

26:36.400 --> 26:43.200
 Goods and services, it's everything. Okay. Productivity is divide that total output by the

26:43.200 --> 26:50.480
 number of hours worked. So we're basically asking how much, how much stuff does the average worker

26:50.480 --> 26:56.480
 produce an hour of work? And if you're seeing really rapid technological progress, then you'd

26:56.480 --> 27:04.160
 expect to see productivity rising at a rapid clip, which we did for the generation after World War

27:04.160 --> 27:12.000
 II, productivity rose 2% a year on a sustained basis. Then it dropped down for a while. Then

27:12.000 --> 27:17.040
 there was a kind of a decade of fairly rapid growth from the mid 90s to the mid 2000s.

27:18.240 --> 27:22.960
 And then it dropped off again. And it's not, it's not impressive right now. So

27:24.240 --> 27:30.320
 you're just not seeing an ethical shift in the economy. So let me then ask you about the psychology

27:30.320 --> 27:36.160
 of blaming automation. A few months ago, you wrote in the New York Times, quote, the other day, I

27:36.160 --> 27:40.800
 found myself as I often do at a conference discussing lagging wages and soaring inequality.

27:40.800 --> 27:45.920
 There was a lot of interesting discussion, but one thing that struck me was how many of the

27:45.920 --> 27:51.360
 participants just assumed that robots are a big part of the problem, that machines are taking away

27:51.360 --> 27:57.680
 the good jobs, or even jobs in general. For the most part, this wasn't even presented as a hypothesis,

27:57.680 --> 28:04.640
 just as part of what everyone knows. Yeah. So why is, maybe can you psychoanalyze our

28:04.640 --> 28:12.480
 the public intellectuals or economists or us actually in the general public, why this is

28:12.480 --> 28:19.440
 happening? Why this assumption is just infiltrated public discourse? There's a couple of things.

28:19.440 --> 28:25.840
 One is that the particular technologies that are advancing now are ones that are a lot more

28:25.840 --> 28:37.120
 visible to the chattering class. When containerization did away with the jobs of Longshoremen, well,

28:37.120 --> 28:43.040
 not a whole lot of college professors are close friends with Longshoremen, right? So we see this

28:43.040 --> 28:50.160
 one. Then there's a second thing, which is we just went through a severe financial crisis in a

28:50.160 --> 28:57.520
 period of very high unemployment. It's finally come down. There's really no question that that

28:57.520 --> 29:03.360
 high unemployment was about macroeconomics. It was about a failure of demand. But macroeconomics

29:03.360 --> 29:09.040
 is really not intuitive. I mean, people just have a hard time wrapping their minds around it. And

29:09.040 --> 29:12.960
 among other things, people have a hard time believing that something as trivial as, well,

29:12.960 --> 29:18.080
 people who just aren't spending enough can lead to the kind of mass misery that we saw in the 1930s

29:18.080 --> 29:25.040
 or not quite so severe, but still serious misery that we saw after 2008. And there's always a

29:25.040 --> 29:29.360
 tendency to say it must be something big. It must be technological change. That means we

29:29.360 --> 29:34.240
 don't need workers anymore. There was a lot of that in the 30s. And that same thing happened

29:34.240 --> 29:40.080
 after 2008, the assumption that it has to be something, some deep cause, not something as

29:40.080 --> 29:46.320
 trivial as a failure of investor confidence and inadequate monetary and fiscal response.

29:46.320 --> 29:56.080
 And the last thing on wages, a lot of what's happened on wages is at some level political.

29:56.080 --> 30:01.120
 It's the collapse of the union movement. It's the policies that have squeezed workers bargaining

30:01.120 --> 30:07.760
 power. And for kind of obvious reasons, there are a lot of influential people who don't want to hear

30:07.760 --> 30:13.840
 that story. They want it to be an inevitable force of nature. Technology has made it impossible to

30:13.840 --> 30:23.280
 have people earn middle class wages. And they don't like the story that says actually, no,

30:23.280 --> 30:28.240
 it's kind of the political decisions that we made that have caused this income stagnation.

30:28.240 --> 30:33.440
 And so there are a receptive audience for technological determinism.

30:33.440 --> 30:38.480
 So what comes first, in your view, the economy or politics in terms of what

30:38.480 --> 30:45.520
 has an impact on the other? Oh, look, everything interacts. Actually, that's

30:45.520 --> 30:50.400
 one of the rules that was taught in economics. Everything affects everything else in at least

30:50.400 --> 31:00.880
 two ways. But I mean, clearly, the economy drives a lot of political stuff. But also,

31:00.880 --> 31:09.600
 clearly, politics has a huge impact on the economy. We look at the decline of unions

31:09.600 --> 31:14.320
 in America and say, well, the world has changed and unions don't have a role.

31:15.040 --> 31:22.160
 But two thirds of workers in Denmark are unionized. And Denmark has the same technology and faces the

31:22.160 --> 31:27.600
 same global economy that we do is just a difference in political choices that leads to that difference.

31:27.600 --> 31:34.640
 So I actually teach a course here at CUNY called Economics of the Welfare State, which is about

31:35.520 --> 31:39.200
 things like health care and retirement and, to some extent, wage policy and so on. And

31:40.560 --> 31:46.240
 the message I keep on trying to drive home is that, look, all advanced countries have got

31:46.240 --> 31:51.840
 roughly equal competence. We all have the same technology. But we make very different choices.

31:51.840 --> 31:56.000
 Not that America always makes the wrong choices. We do some things pretty well. Our retirement

31:56.000 --> 32:01.600
 system is one of the better ones. But the point is that there's a huge amount of

32:02.240 --> 32:05.120
 political choice involved in the shape of the economy.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.680
 CB – So what is a welfare state?

32:07.680 --> 32:14.640
 RL – Welfare state is the old term. But it basically refers to all the programs that are there

32:15.840 --> 32:22.880
 to mitigate, if you like, the risks and injustices of the market economy.

32:22.880 --> 32:27.280
 So in the U.S., welfare state is social security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wages,

32:28.320 --> 32:34.000
 food stamps. When you say welfare state, my first feeling is a negative one.

32:36.480 --> 32:41.440
 I probably generally, at least theoretically, like all the welfare programs.

32:41.440 --> 32:47.280
 CB – Well, it's been demonized. And to some extent, I'm doing a little bit of

32:47.280 --> 32:56.080
 thumbing my nose at all of that by just using the term welfare state. But everybody,

32:56.080 --> 33:00.800
 every advanced country actually has a lot of welfare state, even the U.S.

33:03.120 --> 33:08.160
 That's fundamental part of the fabric of our society. Social security, Medicare, Medicaid

33:08.160 --> 33:19.600
 are just things we take for granted as part of the scene. And so there's a lot of people on

33:19.600 --> 33:26.480
 the right wing who are saying, oh, it's all socialism. And, well, words mean what you want

33:26.480 --> 33:38.080
 them to mean. And just today, I told my class about the record that Ronald Reagan made in

33:38.080 --> 33:44.800
 1961, warning that Medicare would destroy American freedom. But it sort of didn't happen.

33:46.800 --> 33:52.160
 On the topic of welfare state, what are your thoughts on universal basic income? And that's

33:54.240 --> 33:58.400
 not a generic, but a universal safety net of this kind.

33:58.400 --> 34:03.760
 CB – There's always a tradeoff. When we talk about social safety net programs,

34:03.760 --> 34:11.760
 there's always a tradeoff between universality, which is clean, but means that you're giving a

34:11.760 --> 34:18.080
 lot of money to people who don't necessarily need it, and some kind of targeting, which makes it

34:18.080 --> 34:28.320
 easier to deal with the crucial problems with limited resources, but both has incentive problems and

34:28.320 --> 34:36.800
 kind of political, and I would say even psychological issues. So the great thing about

34:36.800 --> 34:44.000
 social security in Medicare is no questions asked. You don't have to prove that you need them.

34:45.280 --> 34:54.800
 It just comes. I'm on Medicare allegedly. I mean, it's run through my New York Times health

34:54.800 --> 35:02.000
 insurance, but I didn't have to file an application with the Medicare office to prove that I needed

35:02.000 --> 35:08.960
 it. It just happened when I turned 65. That's good for dignity, and it's also good for the

35:08.960 --> 35:18.400
 political support because everybody gets Medicare. On the other hand, and we can do that with healthcare,

35:18.400 --> 35:27.760
 to give everybody a guarantee of an income that's enough to live on comfortably, that's a lot of

35:27.760 --> 35:36.000
 money. CB – What about enough income to carry you over through difficult periods like if you lose

35:36.000 --> 35:39.760
 a job or that kind of? CB – Well, we have unemployment insurance, and I think our unemployment

35:39.760 --> 35:47.520
 insurance is too short lived and too stingy. It would be better to have a more comprehensive

35:47.520 --> 35:54.160
 unemployment insurance benefit. But the trouble with something like universal basic income is that

35:54.160 --> 36:01.360
 either the bar is set too low, so it's really not something you can live on, or it's an enormously

36:01.360 --> 36:08.880
 expensive program. And so at this point, I think that we can do far better by building on the kinds

36:08.880 --> 36:14.800
 of safety and net programs we have. I mean, food stamps, earned income tax credit, we should have

36:14.800 --> 36:22.080
 a lot more family support policies. Those things can do a lot more to really diminish the amount

36:22.080 --> 36:32.560
 of misery in this country. UBI is something that goes hand in hand with this belief that

36:33.120 --> 36:37.440
 the robots are going to take all of our jobs. And if that was really happening, then I might

36:37.440 --> 36:45.600
 reconsider my views on UPI, but I don't see that happening. CB – So are you happy with discourse

36:45.600 --> 36:51.360
 that's going on now in terms of politics? So you mentioned a few political candidates. Is the

36:51.360 --> 36:58.320
 kind of thing going on both on Twitter and debates and the media through the written

36:58.320 --> 37:03.520
 words is a spoken word. How do you assess the public discourse now in terms of politics?

37:03.520 --> 37:11.360
 UBI – We're in a fragmented world. So more so than ever before. So at this point, the public

37:12.000 --> 37:23.600
 discourse that you see if Fox News is your principal news source is very different from

37:23.600 --> 37:29.760
 the one you get if you read the New York Times. On the whole, my sense is that mainstream political

37:29.760 --> 37:38.480
 reporting, policy reporting is A, not too great, but B, better than it's ever been. Because when I

37:38.480 --> 37:45.280
 first got into the pundit business, it was just awful. Lots of things just never got covered.

37:45.280 --> 37:52.560
 And if things did get covered, it was always both sides. It's the line that comes back from me

37:52.560 --> 37:59.920
 writing during the 2000 campaign was that if one of the candidates said that the earth was flat, the

37:59.920 --> 38:06.480
 headline would be views differ on shape of planet. And that's less true. There's still a fair bit

38:06.480 --> 38:09.600
 of that out there, but it's less true than there used to be. And there are more people

38:11.600 --> 38:15.920
 reporting, writing on policy issues who actually understand them than ever before.

38:15.920 --> 38:29.680
 So, though, that's good. But I still, I have how much the typical voter is actually informed

38:30.720 --> 38:40.640
 unclear. I mean, the democratic debates, I think we I'm hoping that we finally get down to having a

38:40.640 --> 38:48.080
 not having 27 people on the stage or whatever it is they have. But yeah, they're reasonably

38:48.080 --> 38:55.200
 substantive, certainly better than before. And while there's a lot of still, you know,

38:55.200 --> 39:01.280
 theater criticism instead of actual analysis and the reporting, it's not as totally dominant as in

39:01.280 --> 39:13.280
 the past. Can ask maybe a dumb question. But from an open minded perspective, when you know,

39:13.280 --> 39:21.520
 people on the left and people on the right, I think view the other the others as sometimes

39:21.520 --> 39:29.840
 complete idiots. Yeah. What do we do with that? You know, is it possible that the people on the

39:29.840 --> 39:39.680
 right are correct about their what they currently believe? Is that kind of open mindedness helpful?

39:40.480 --> 39:47.280
 Or is this division long term productive for us to sort of have this food fight?

39:48.480 --> 39:55.680
 Well, the trouble you have to confront is that there's a lot of stuff that just is false out

39:55.680 --> 40:01.600
 there and but commands extensive political allegiance. So the idea, well, both sides need

40:01.600 --> 40:09.040
 to listen to each other respectfully. I'm happy to do that. When there's a view that is worthy of

40:09.040 --> 40:17.600
 respect, but a lot of stuff is not. And so take economics is something where I think I know

40:17.600 --> 40:22.560
 something. And I'm not sure that I'm always right. In fact, I know I'm I've been wrong

40:22.560 --> 40:31.360
 plenty of times. But I think there is a difference between economic views that are within the realm

40:31.360 --> 40:39.440
 of we can we can actually have an interesting discussion. And those that are just crank doctrines

40:39.440 --> 40:45.680
 or things that that are purely being disseminated because people are being paid to disseminate

40:45.680 --> 40:52.800
 them. So there are there are plenty of good serious center right economists that are happy to to talk

40:52.800 --> 40:58.560
 to. None of those center right economists has any role in the Trump administration. Trump

40:58.560 --> 41:04.000
 administration and by and large Republicans in Congress only want to listen to people who are

41:04.000 --> 41:11.920
 cranks. And so I think it's being dishonest with my readers to to pretend otherwise. There's no way

41:11.920 --> 41:19.200
 I can reach out to people who think that that reading Ayn Rand novels is is is how you learn

41:19.200 --> 41:24.400
 about monetary economics. Let me linger on that point. So if you look at Ayn Rand, okay,

41:24.400 --> 41:29.280
 so you said center right, what about extreme people who have like radical views? You think

41:29.280 --> 41:37.520
 they're not grounded in in any kind of data in the kind of reality. I'm just the sort of

41:37.520 --> 41:46.480
 curious about how open we should be to ideas that seem radical. Oh, radical ideas is fine. But

41:46.480 --> 41:54.080
 then you have to have to have to ask is there some basis for the radicalism. And if it's if it's a

41:54.960 --> 42:01.920
 if it's something that is not grounded in anything, then and particularly by the way,

42:01.920 --> 42:06.960
 if it's something that's been refuted by evidence again and again, and the people just keep saying

42:06.960 --> 42:12.400
 it if it's a zombie idea, and there's a lot of those out there, then there comes a point when

42:12.400 --> 42:19.040
 it's not worth trying to fake respect for it. I see. So there's a through the scientific process

42:19.040 --> 42:25.200
 you've shown that this idea does not hold water. But I like the idea zombie ideas, but they live on

42:25.200 --> 42:31.920
 through. It's like the idea that the earth is flat, for example, has been for the most part

42:31.920 --> 42:39.440
 disproven. Yeah. But it lives on actually growing in popularity currently. Yeah. And there's a lot

42:39.440 --> 42:45.760
 of that out there. And there you can't you can't wish it away. And it's you're not being fair to

42:45.760 --> 42:50.320
 either yourself or if you're somebody who writes for the public, you're not being fair to your

42:50.320 --> 42:58.400
 readers to pretend otherwise. So quantum mechanics is a strange theory, but it's testable. And so

42:58.400 --> 43:04.240
 while being strange, it's why they accept it amongst physicists. How robust and testable are

43:04.240 --> 43:10.480
 economics theories? If we compare them to quantum mechanics and physics and so on?

43:11.360 --> 43:17.920
 Okay, economics, look, it's a complex system. And it's also one in which by and large, you don't get

43:17.920 --> 43:24.960
 to do experiments. And so economics is never going to be like quantum mechanics. That said,

43:24.960 --> 43:31.920
 you get natural experiments, you get tests of rival doctrines, you know, in the immediate

43:31.920 --> 43:40.960
 aftermath of the financial crisis, there was one style, one, one basic theory of macroeconomics,

43:40.960 --> 43:45.360
 which ultimately goes back to John Maynard Keynes that made a few predictions, it said,

43:46.160 --> 43:52.960
 under these circumstances, printing money will not be inflationary, running big budget deficits

43:52.960 --> 43:59.600
 will not cause a rise in interest rates, slashing government spending, austerity policies will

43:59.600 --> 44:08.960
 lead to depressions if tried. Other people had, you know, exactly the opposite predictions. And

44:08.960 --> 44:14.640
 we got a fairly robust test and, you know, one theory one, interest rates stayed low, inflation

44:14.640 --> 44:21.040
 stayed low, austerity, countries that implemented harsh austerity policies suffered severe economic

44:21.040 --> 44:27.920
 downturns. You don't get much, you know, that's pretty clear. And that's not going to be true

44:27.920 --> 44:35.520
 on everything. But there's a lot of empirical, I mean, the younger economists these days are very

44:35.520 --> 44:42.080
 heavy, heavily data based. And it's, and that's great. And I think that's the way to go.

44:43.360 --> 44:47.520
 What theories of economics are, is there currently a lot of disagreement about what you said?

44:47.520 --> 44:55.120
 Oh, first of all, there's just a lot less disagreement, really, among serious researchers

44:55.120 --> 45:00.880
 and economics than people imagine. When we actually, we can track that the Chicago Booth

45:00.880 --> 45:08.480
 School has a panel, an ideologically diverse panel, and they pose regularly posed questions. And on

45:08.480 --> 45:16.480
 most things, there's a huge, there's remarkable consensus. There's a lot of things where there,

45:16.480 --> 45:22.240
 you people imagine that there's dispute, but the the illusion of dispute is something that's

45:22.240 --> 45:27.440
 basically being fed by political forces. And there isn't really, I mean, there are,

45:28.640 --> 45:37.520
 I think we questions about what are effective ways to regulate technology industries, we really don't

45:37.520 --> 45:50.000
 know the answers there. There's a, or look, I don't follow every part, minimum wages. I think

45:50.000 --> 45:56.400
 there's there's pretty overwhelming evidence that that a modest increase in the minimum wage from

45:56.400 --> 46:05.600
 current levels would be would not have any noticeable adverse effect on on jobs. But if you

46:05.600 --> 46:14.720
 ask, how high could it go? $12 seems pretty safe, given what we know. 15 is 15. Okay,

46:14.720 --> 46:21.120
 there's some legitimate disagreement there, I think probably, but, but I can, people have a point.

46:22.240 --> 46:28.080
 20, where is the line at which it starts to become a problem? And the answer is, truly, we don't know.

46:28.080 --> 46:34.000
 It's fascinating to try to, such a cool economics is cool in that sense. Because you're trying to

46:34.000 --> 46:38.720
 predict something that hasn't been done before the impact the effects of something that hasn't

46:38.720 --> 46:43.520
 been done before. Yeah, you're trying, you're going out of sample. And we have good reason to

46:43.520 --> 46:48.800
 believe that, that there are, you know, that it's nonlinear, that there comes a point at which it

46:48.800 --> 46:54.480
 doesn't work the way it has in the past. So as an economist, how do you see science and

46:54.480 --> 47:00.560
 technological innovation? When I took various economics courses in college, technological

47:00.560 --> 47:07.040
 innovation seemed like a no brainer way of growing an economy. And we should invest in it

47:07.040 --> 47:13.760
 aggressively. I may be biased, but it seemed like the various ways to grow an economy seems like

47:13.760 --> 47:20.640
 the easiest way, especially long term. Is that correct? And if so, why aren't we doing it more?

47:20.640 --> 47:26.960
 Well, that's okay. The first question is, yeah, I mean, all, it's pretty much overwhelming.

47:26.960 --> 47:31.600
 But we think we can more or less measure this, although there are some assumptions involved,

47:31.600 --> 47:36.560
 but it's something like 70 to 80% of the growth and per capita income is,

47:37.200 --> 47:42.000
 is basically the advance of knowledge. It's not just, it's not just the crude accumulation of

47:42.000 --> 47:48.720
 capital. It is, it is the fact that we get, get smarter. A lot of that, by the way, is more prosaic

47:48.720 --> 47:56.320
 kinds of technology. So, you know, we, I like to talk about things like containerization or, you

47:56.320 --> 48:06.880
 know, in an earlier period, the invention of the flat pack cardboard box that have to be invented.

48:06.880 --> 48:13.040
 And, and now all of your deliveries from Amazon are made possible by the existence of that

48:13.040 --> 48:18.640
 technology that the web stuff is, is, is important too. But, but what would we do without cardboard

48:18.640 --> 48:24.640
 boxes? So, but all of that stuff is really important in driving economic progress.

48:25.360 --> 48:34.480
 Well, why don't we invest more? Why don't we invest more in, again, more prosaic stuff?

48:34.480 --> 48:38.960
 Why aren't, why haven't we built another goddamn rail tunnel under the Hudson River?

48:38.960 --> 48:44.800
 Which is, for which the need is, is so totally overwhelmingly obvious.

48:44.800 --> 48:48.000
 How do you think about, first of all, I don't even know what the word prosaic means,

48:48.000 --> 48:55.120
 but I inferred it. But how do you think about prosaic? Is it the really most basic dumb technology

48:56.000 --> 49:03.120
 innovation? Or is it just like the lowest hanging fruit of where benefit can be gained?

49:03.120 --> 49:09.760
 When I say prosaic, I mean stuff that is not sexy and fancy and high tech.

49:09.760 --> 49:18.880
 It's building bridges and tunnels, having, inventing the cardboard box or

49:22.000 --> 49:30.480
 the, I don't know, where do we put an easy pass in there? That's a, it is, it is actually using

49:30.480 --> 49:36.160
 some modern technology and all that, but it's, you're not going to have, I don't think you're

49:36.160 --> 49:41.840
 going to make a movie about, about the fact that the guy, whoever it was that invented easy pass,

49:41.840 --> 49:46.160
 but, but it's actually a pretty significant productivity booster.

49:46.160 --> 49:50.240
 To me, it always seemed like it's something that everybody should be able to agree on.

49:50.240 --> 50:01.200
 And just invest. So like in the same way, there's the investment in the military and the DOD is

50:01.200 --> 50:09.760
 huge. So everyone kind of, not everyone, but there's a, there's an agreement amongst people

50:09.760 --> 50:16.240
 that somehow that a large defense is important. It always seemed to me like,

50:16.240 --> 50:22.720
 you should, that should be shifted towards, if you want to grow prosperity of the nation,

50:22.720 --> 50:27.920
 you should be investing in knowledge. Yes, prosaic stuff, infrastructure, investing infrastructure

50:27.920 --> 50:33.440
 and so on. I mean, sorry to linger on it, but do you have any intuition? Do you have hope that

50:33.440 --> 50:39.040
 that changes? Do you have intuition why it's not changing? It's unclear which intuition,

50:39.040 --> 50:45.280
 I have a theory. I'm reasonably certain that I understand why, why we don't do it. And it's,

50:46.480 --> 50:56.720
 it's because, because we have a real values dispute about the welfare state, about how much

50:56.720 --> 51:02.160
 the government should do to help the unfortunate and politicians believe

51:02.160 --> 51:09.200
 probably rightly, that there's a kind of halo effect that surrounds any kind of government

51:09.200 --> 51:17.600
 intervention. That even though providing people with enhanced social security benefits is really

51:17.600 --> 51:23.520
 very different from building a tunnel under the Hudson River, politicians of both parties seem

51:23.520 --> 51:27.760
 to believe that it's the government to seem to be successful at doing one kind of thing.

51:27.760 --> 51:32.480
 I mean, it will make people think more favorably on it doing other kinds of things. And so we have

51:32.480 --> 51:38.320
 conservatives tend to be opposed to any kind of increase in government spending, except military,

51:39.680 --> 51:47.120
 no matter how obviously a good idea it is, because they fear that it's the thin end of the wedge

51:47.120 --> 51:54.480
 for bigger government in general. And to some extent, liberals tend to favor spending on these

51:54.480 --> 52:00.880
 things, partly because they see it as a way of proving that government can do things well,

52:00.880 --> 52:08.800
 and therefore it can turn to broader social goals. It's clearly, there's a, if you like,

52:10.640 --> 52:14.720
 you might have thought would be a technocratic discussion about government investment, both

52:14.720 --> 52:20.880
 in research and in infrastructure is contaminated by the fact that government is government and

52:20.880 --> 52:27.600
 people link it to other government actions. Perhaps a silly question, but as a species,

52:27.600 --> 52:32.720
 we're currently working on venturing out into space, one day colonizing Mars. So

52:33.840 --> 52:40.320
 when we start a society on Mars from scratch, what political and economic system should it

52:40.320 --> 52:45.760
 operate under? Oh, I'm a big believer in, first of all, I don't think we're actually gonna do that,

52:45.760 --> 52:53.280
 but let's, let's imagine, hypothesize that we colonize Mars or something. Look, representative

52:53.280 --> 53:05.200
 democracy is versus pure democracy. Well, yeah, pure democracy where people vote directly on

53:05.200 --> 53:13.920
 everything is really problematic because people don't have time to, to, to try and master every

53:13.920 --> 53:19.200
 issue. I mean, we, we can see what government by referendum looks like. There's a lot of that in,

53:19.200 --> 53:23.840
 in California. And it's, it doesn't work so good because it's hard to explain to people

53:24.720 --> 53:30.800
 the various things they vote for may conflict. So representative democracy is,

53:32.720 --> 53:38.160
 it's got lots of problems. And I kind of the Winston Churchill thing, right? It's the worst

53:38.160 --> 53:44.400
 system we know, except for all the others. But so yeah, sticking with the representative

53:45.520 --> 53:52.960
 and basically the American system of regulation and markets and the economy we have going on is,

53:52.960 --> 53:58.400
 is a pretty good one for Mars. If you start from scratch, if you're gonna start from scratch,

53:58.400 --> 54:04.320
 you wouldn't, you wouldn't want a Senate where 16% of the population has half the seats.

54:04.320 --> 54:12.800
 You probably would want one which is, you know, more, actually more representative than what we have.

54:12.800 --> 54:22.640
 And the, the details, it's unclear. I mean, the, we, when times are good, all of the various

54:22.640 --> 54:30.240
 representatives democracy systems, whether it's parliamentary democracies or a US style system,

54:30.240 --> 54:34.000
 whether you have a prime minister or the head of state as an elected president,

54:34.000 --> 54:37.920
 they all kind of work well and they all, when times are good, and they all have different

54:37.920 --> 54:44.080
 modes of breakdown. So I'm not sure I know what the answer is, but, but something like that is

54:45.280 --> 54:52.000
 given what we've seen through history, it, it, it's the least bad system out there. I mean, I don't

54:52.000 --> 55:03.040
 know if you, I'm a big fan of, of the TV series, The Expanse and, and it's kind of gratifying that

55:03.040 --> 55:13.440
 out there, the, the, it's the Martian Congressional Republic. Okay. In a brief sense, so amongst many

55:13.440 --> 55:23.280
 things, you're also an expert at international trade. What do you make of the, the complexity?

55:23.280 --> 55:29.920
 So I can understand trade between two people, say two neighboring farmers. It seems pretty

55:29.920 --> 55:34.320
 straightforward to me, but international, we need to start talking about nations and

55:34.320 --> 55:41.200
 nations trading seems to be very complicated. So from a high level, why is it so complicated?

55:41.200 --> 55:47.120
 What are all the different factors, that way, the objectives need to be considered an international

55:47.120 --> 55:54.960
 trade? And maybe feeding that into a question of, do you have concerns about the two giants right

55:54.960 --> 56:00.800
 now of the U.S. and China and the, and the tension that's going on with the international trade

56:00.800 --> 56:05.040
 there with the trade war? Well, first of all, international trade is not really that different

56:05.040 --> 56:12.560
 from trade among individuals. It's, it's vastly more complex and there are, there are many more

56:12.560 --> 56:17.360
 players, but in the end, the reasons why countries trade are pretty much the same as the reasons

56:17.360 --> 56:20.720
 why individuals trade, countries trade because they're different and they can

56:22.560 --> 56:26.560
 derive mutual advantage from concentrating on the things they do relatively well. And

56:26.560 --> 56:36.080
 also, there are economies of scale, you know, you don't not individuals have to decide whether to

56:36.080 --> 56:42.240
 be a surgeon or a, or an accountant, it's probably not a good idea to try and be both and countries

56:42.240 --> 56:48.320
 benefit from specializing just because of the inherent advantages of specialization. And that's,

56:48.320 --> 56:55.040
 so that now the fact it's a big world and the, we're talking about millions of products being

56:55.040 --> 57:04.080
 traded and in today's world often trade involves many stages. So that made in China, iPhone is

57:04.080 --> 57:10.160
 actually assembled from components that are made all over the world. And, but it doesn't really

57:10.160 --> 57:20.080
 change the fundamentals all that much. There's a recurrent, I mean, the big, the big, the dirty

57:20.080 --> 57:26.880
 little secret of international trade conflict is that actually it's not conflicts among countries

57:26.880 --> 57:34.240
 are really not that important. Most trade is beneficial to both sides and to both countries,

57:35.040 --> 57:42.320
 but it has big impacts on the distribution of income within countries. So the growth of U.S.

57:42.320 --> 57:50.640
 trade with China has made both U.S. and China richer, but it's been pretty bad for people who

57:50.640 --> 57:55.760
 were employed in the North Carolina furniture industry who did find that their jobs were

57:55.760 --> 58:01.360
 displaced by a wave of imports from China. And so that's where the complexity comes in.

58:03.280 --> 58:09.040
 Not at all clear to me. I mean, we have some real problems with China, although they'll

58:09.040 --> 58:14.960
 really involve trade so much as things like respect for intellectual property.

58:17.120 --> 58:22.080
 Not clear that those real problems that we do have with China have anything to do with the

58:22.080 --> 58:29.040
 current trade war. Current trade war seems to be driven instead by a fundamentally wrong notion

58:29.040 --> 58:33.600
 that when we sell goods to China, that's good. And when we buy goods from China, that's bad.

58:33.600 --> 58:39.680
 And that's misunderstanding the whole point. Is trade with China in both directions a good thing?

58:40.480 --> 58:46.320
 Yeah, we would be poorer if it wasn't for it. But there are downsides as there are for any

58:46.320 --> 58:52.480
 economic change. It's like any new technology makes us richer, but often hurts some people.

58:53.120 --> 59:00.800
 Trade with China makes us richer, but hurts some people. And I wouldn't undo what has happened,

59:00.800 --> 59:07.680
 but I wish we had had a better policy for supporting and compensating the losers from that growth.

59:09.200 --> 59:14.880
 So we live in a time of radicalization of political ideas, Twitter mobs and so on.

59:15.520 --> 59:22.160
 And yet here you are in the midst of it, both tweeting and writing in the New York Times articles

59:22.160 --> 59:27.680
 with strong opinions, writing this chaotic wave of public discourse. Do you ever

59:27.680 --> 59:34.800
 hesitate or feel a tinge of fear for exploring your ideas publicly and unapologetically?

59:34.800 --> 59:42.240
 Oh, I feel fear all the time. It's not too hard to imagine scenarios in which I might personally

59:42.240 --> 59:52.240
 find myself kind of in the crosshairs. And I am the king of hate mail. I get amazing correspondence.

59:52.240 --> 1:00:00.000
 Does it affect you? It did when it started these days. I've developed a very thick skin.

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:08.160
 So I don't usually get. In fact, if I don't get a wave of hate mail after a column, then

1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:16.160
 I probably wasted that day. So what do you make of that as a person who's putting ideas out there?

1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:21.040
 If you look at the history of ideas, the way it works is you write about ideas,

1:00:21.040 --> 1:00:26.640
 you put them out there. But now when there's so much hate mail, so much division,

1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:32.800
 what advice do you have for yourself and for others trying to have a discussion about ideas,

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:38.960
 difficult ideas? Well, I don't know about advice for others. I mean, for most economists,

1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:47.120
 just do your research. We can't all be public intellectuals and we shouldn't try to be. And

1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:55.360
 in fact, I'm glad that I didn't get into this business until I was in my late 40s. I mean,

1:00:55.360 --> 1:01:03.840
 this is probably best to spend your decades of greatest intellectual flexibility addressing

1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:12.880
 deep questions, not confronting Twitter mobs. And as for the rest, I think when you're writing

1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:23.280
 about stuff, Dan says, like no one's watching, write like nobody's reading. Write what you think

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:28.480
 is right. Trying to make it, obviously, trying to make it comprehensible and persuasive, but

1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:38.160
 don't let yourself get intimidated by the fact that some people are going to say nasty things.

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:47.200
 It's, you can't do your job if you are worried about criticism.

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.320
 Well, I think I speak for a lot of people and saying that I hope that you keep dancing like

1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:58.960
 nobody's watching on Twitter and New York Times and books. So Paul, it's been an honor. Thank you

1:02:32.720 --> 1:02:39.360
 words from Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations, one of the most influential philosophers and

1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:44.640
 economists in our history. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the

1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:50.720
 baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interests. We address ourselves

1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:57.120
 not to their humanity, but to their self love and never talk to them of our necessities,

1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:03.680
 but of their advantages. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
