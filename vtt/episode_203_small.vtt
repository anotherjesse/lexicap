00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
 The following is a conversation with Anya Fernald,

00:02.700 --> 00:05.800
 cofounder of Belcampo Farms that was founded

00:05.800 --> 00:08.560
 with the purpose to create meat that's good for people,

00:08.560 --> 00:10.560
 the planet, and the animals,

00:10.560 --> 00:12.840
 specifically treating their animals

00:12.840 --> 00:14.920
 as ethically as possible.

00:14.920 --> 00:18.120
 In this, she sought to revolutionize the meat industry

00:18.120 --> 00:19.600
 from the inside out.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.120
 She's also a scholar and practitioner

00:22.120 --> 00:24.080
 of regenerative agriculture,

00:24.080 --> 00:26.960
 and she's a chef who has appeared many times

00:26.960 --> 00:28.760
 as a judge on Iron Chef.

00:28.760 --> 00:32.880
 Plus, she has one of my favorite food related Instagrams.

00:32.880 --> 00:33.720
 On top of that,

00:33.720 --> 00:36.160
 she's also a longtime friend of Andrew Huberman,

00:36.160 --> 00:38.480
 which is how we first got connected.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.280
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:40.280 --> 00:45.280
 Gala Games, Athletic Greens, FourSigmatic, and Fun2Rise.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.800
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.360
 As a side note, let me say that I got the chance

00:51.360 --> 00:53.840
 to visit and spend a few days with Anya

00:53.840 --> 00:56.800
 at Belcampo Farms in Northern California.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.920
 I met many animals there from cows to pigs

00:59.920 --> 01:03.120
 and saw the amazing land on which they grazed.

01:03.120 --> 01:07.640
 I butchered meat, I watched Anya cook many amazing meals,

01:07.640 --> 01:10.360
 I ate raw meat and cooked meat,

01:10.360 --> 01:13.160
 and spent long hours at the bonfire

01:13.160 --> 01:16.800
 talking with friends and listening to the sounds of nature.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.600
 I hiked, swam in a cold mountain lake,

01:19.600 --> 01:22.760
 and slept in a tent underneath the stars.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.480
 It was an amazing eye opening experience,

01:25.480 --> 01:29.920
 especially in my first ever visit to a slaughterhouse.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.600
 The term slaughterhouse is haunting in itself.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.560
 The animals I met lived a great life,

01:36.560 --> 01:38.960
 but in the end, they were slaughtered

01:38.960 --> 01:40.720
 in the most ethical way possible,

01:40.720 --> 01:43.040
 but slaughtered nevertheless.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.240
 Seeing animals with whom just the day before

01:45.240 --> 01:47.960
 made a connection be converted to meat

01:47.960 --> 01:51.840
 that I then consumed was deeply honest to me.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.480
 This ethical farm, Belcampo,

01:54.480 --> 01:56.640
 represents less than 1% of animals raised

01:56.640 --> 01:58.120
 in the United States.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.560
 The rest is factory farmed.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.680
 I could not escape the thought of the 40 to 50 billion

02:03.680 --> 02:06.360
 animals worldwide raised in terrible conditions

02:06.360 --> 02:08.400
 on these factory farms.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.680
 I've spent most of my life thinking about

02:10.680 --> 02:13.880
 and being in contact with human suffering,

02:13.880 --> 02:15.680
 but the landscape of suffering in the minds

02:15.680 --> 02:19.000
 of conscious beings is much larger than humans.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.280
 I must admit that I still am haunted

02:21.280 --> 02:24.480
 by human suffering more than animal suffering.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.600
 Perhaps I will one day see the wrong

02:26.600 --> 02:28.680
 in me drawing such a line.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.960
 Either way, the visit to Belcampo farms

02:30.960 --> 02:34.200
 made me realize that I have not thought deeply enough

02:34.200 --> 02:36.200
 about the ethics of my choices

02:36.200 --> 02:38.120
 and the choices of human civilization

02:38.120 --> 02:39.880
 with respect to animals.

02:39.880 --> 02:44.040
 And more importantly, I have not thought or learned enough

02:44.040 --> 02:48.080
 about large scale solutions to alleviate animal suffering.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.000
 Belcampo is paving the way on this

02:50.000 --> 02:52.160
 and is the reason I wanted to show my support

02:52.160 --> 02:55.960
 for their and Anya's efforts in regenerative farming

02:55.960 --> 02:58.760
 and ethical treatment of animals.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.720
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

03:00.720 --> 03:03.800
 and here is my conversation with Anya Fernald.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.720
 If you're watching the video version of this

03:15.720 --> 03:17.960
 and are asking yourself why we're in nature right now,

03:17.960 --> 03:20.920
 there's actually a beautiful mountain in the background.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.440
 There's an incredible, vast landscape.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.280
 There's a farm.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.880
 We're sitting behind a table and nevertheless,

03:28.880 --> 03:32.360
 I'm wearing a suit and tie amidst nature.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.400
 We're at the beautiful Belcampo farms.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.800
 We're going to talk about that,

03:36.800 --> 03:38.280
 this incredible place you have here,

03:38.280 --> 03:40.680
 but you cooked some meat yesterday.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.040
 It tasted delicious.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.640
 So I'd love to talk about just the science

03:44.640 --> 03:46.800
 and art of cooking first.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.440
 You as a chef, when you think of cooking,

03:49.440 --> 03:51.800
 is it a science or is it an art?

03:51.800 --> 03:55.440
 Art and service together, probably.

03:55.440 --> 04:00.440
 Art to me because it's about creating something of beauty

04:00.800 --> 04:03.280
 and being responsive and creating something

04:03.280 --> 04:06.080
 that's expression of creativity and love.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.400
 Cooking also has a very strong element of service

04:09.400 --> 04:11.480
 and it doesn't mean necessarily service to another person,

04:11.480 --> 04:14.880
 but like service to health, wellness, environment.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.280
 There's element of supporting through food

04:17.280 --> 04:18.800
 in how I approach cooking.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.120
 So it's bigger than just how the ingredients

04:21.120 --> 04:22.520
 come together to form a taste.

04:22.520 --> 04:26.680
 It's the whole pipeline, the fact that there's a lot of work

04:26.680 --> 04:30.720
 that went into bringing the ingredients together

04:30.720 --> 04:35.720
 and then giving you the ability to make the meal

04:36.400 --> 04:39.000
 and then who gets to consume the meal and the whole thing.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.880
 And you see that as service as opposed to just the taste.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.640
 Yeah, I also think of food as one of the key ways

04:46.640 --> 04:50.280
 that we interact with our environment, right?

04:50.280 --> 04:52.480
 It's the part of our environment

04:52.480 --> 04:54.520
 that goes inside us most visibly, right?

04:54.520 --> 04:55.840
 Of course, we interact with our environment.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.440
 We could have skin creams that have certain things in them

04:58.440 --> 05:00.960
 or our clothes can then be absorbed.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.880
 There's things in the air, there's our water

05:02.880 --> 05:03.920
 and there's food, right?

05:03.920 --> 05:07.400
 It's like how we're engaging in the world physiologically.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.600
 It's the most significant way we engage in our environment.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.280
 We're extracting resources, calories, energy

05:13.280 --> 05:14.920
 from the environment in various ways

05:14.920 --> 05:19.080
 in order to preserve our bodies.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.280
 There's also so many feedback loops

05:21.280 --> 05:23.760
 that I don't think we know the beginning of

05:23.760 --> 05:26.960
 that our bodies are picking up on around nutrients,

05:26.960 --> 05:29.560
 available nutrients, immune response.

05:29.560 --> 05:33.760
 Like there's deep levels of sensory evaluation

05:33.760 --> 05:38.160
 that lead to health and alertness and wellness.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.280
 You hear about this a lot like with babies

05:40.280 --> 05:43.840
 that if there's a risk of an infection

05:43.840 --> 05:46.320
 that a mom's breast milk will help the baby

05:46.320 --> 05:47.720
 develop a resistance.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.280
 Like there's this way that our bodies can tune into health

05:50.280 --> 05:52.600
 and can't extrapolate from that in any specific way.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.200
 But think about that as an example of the many ways

05:55.200 --> 05:58.360
 in which our bodies are reading available nutrients and food

05:58.360 --> 06:01.680
 to signal other aspects of wellness and health.

06:01.680 --> 06:06.120
 That said, the final product of cooking

06:06.120 --> 06:08.680
 is one done well, is really delicious.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.520
 And yesterday was really delicious.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.640
 So that aspect of it,

06:12.640 --> 06:15.280
 bringing the ingredients together

06:15.280 --> 06:17.480
 in a way that tastes delicious.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.840
 Do you see that as a science or art?

06:19.840 --> 06:21.160
 That's the art of it.

06:21.160 --> 06:24.360
 I mean, the art is like creating temptation

06:24.360 --> 06:27.200
 and indulgence and giving people pause.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.920
 You know, like creating experience that's like so sensual

06:29.920 --> 06:33.360
 and like, I love that about when I make something

06:33.360 --> 06:36.600
 really simple and beautiful and delicious

06:36.600 --> 06:39.880
 the way that there's that moment of silence at the table.

06:39.880 --> 06:43.680
 And that to me is the moment of art, like of appreciation.

06:43.680 --> 06:44.600
 What about the buildup?

06:44.600 --> 06:48.000
 I mean, we got to watch you make the stuff over a fire

06:48.000 --> 06:49.560
 so the calmness of the air.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.040
 I mean, that's an experience.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.880
 We don't often get to have to see that experience

06:53.880 --> 06:56.520
 of the preparation, it's the anticipation, like you said.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.160
 Maybe that's the most delicious part of a meal

06:58.160 --> 06:59.800
 is the anticipation of it.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.560
 That's something that I'm glad you bring up

07:01.560 --> 07:03.680
 because it's an element that with eating

07:03.680 --> 07:06.200
 so many of our meals like out of a bag

07:06.200 --> 07:09.840
 and the instance where you start to eat the meals

07:09.840 --> 07:11.280
 when the delivery shows up

07:11.280 --> 07:13.080
 and you might smell something when you open the bag, right?

07:13.080 --> 07:16.120
 And no judgment on that, that's something I do too, right?

07:16.120 --> 07:20.880
 But that does take away a whole element of surprise and delight.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.520
 And also I think of your body's ability to prepare for it.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.720
 You think about our most common memories of childhood

07:26.720 --> 07:29.840
 for those of us who grew up in homes with parents who cooked

07:29.840 --> 07:31.680
 is smell of things cooking.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.000
 And it's not the eating of it,

07:33.000 --> 07:34.960
 it's the smell of things cooking.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.360
 So why is that so memorable?

07:37.360 --> 07:40.120
 It's an anticipatory piece of food.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.440
 That's what you remember about your experiences of food

07:42.440 --> 07:44.240
 is the moment of sweet anticipation

07:44.240 --> 07:46.080
 of this great sensual experience

07:46.080 --> 07:47.920
 that's gonna be really gratifying

07:47.920 --> 07:49.880
 on these emotional and physical levels.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.640
 So I think we're also resonating on those memories

07:52.640 --> 07:55.400
 because it's an experience of food

07:55.400 --> 07:58.000
 where the sensuality of it is kind of extended.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.040
 So it's a long kind of arc of buildup

08:00.040 --> 08:01.520
 and then you're eating it and it's amazing

08:01.520 --> 08:03.720
 and then you're enjoying it and your body feels good.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.320
 So all those pieces together,

08:05.320 --> 08:06.840
 it's a much more memorable experience

08:06.840 --> 08:08.960
 than just grabbing the cookie out of a bag, right?

08:08.960 --> 08:12.640
 So look at our own and just revisit in your mind,

08:12.640 --> 08:15.400
 like the memories of food, the most compelling ones,

08:15.400 --> 08:18.800
 it's the smell and then the experience

08:18.800 --> 08:20.920
 and then sometimes how one felt, right?

08:20.920 --> 08:22.920
 Yeah, and the people involved with the smell.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.200
 So like somehow it's all tied in together

08:25.200 --> 08:27.080
 whether it's family or people close to you

08:27.080 --> 08:28.520
 or even if it's just chefs,

08:28.520 --> 08:32.640
 there's something about the personality of the human

08:32.640 --> 08:34.600
 involved in making the food that kind of sticks

08:34.600 --> 08:35.880
 with you in the memory.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.720
 And for me, I recently did a 72 hour fast

08:38.720 --> 08:42.920
 and there's a kind of sadness after you eat that it's over.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.400
 I think the most delicious part was the,

08:45.400 --> 08:46.880
 I went to a grocery store

08:46.880 --> 08:50.520
 and just actually walking around and looking at food

08:50.520 --> 08:52.360
 with like everything looked delicious.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.480
 Even like the crappiest stuff looked delicious

08:54.480 --> 08:56.440
 and I missed that.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.040
 I really enjoyed that anticipation

08:58.040 --> 08:59.600
 and then I picked out the meal,

08:59.600 --> 09:01.080
 I went home and I cooked it

09:01.080 --> 09:03.200
 and the whole thing took, I don't know,

09:03.200 --> 09:05.480
 maybe two, three hours, like the whole process

09:05.480 --> 09:07.520
 and that was the most delicious part

09:07.520 --> 09:08.720
 and the first taste of course.

09:08.720 --> 09:13.640
 And then after it was over, there's a bit of a sadness

09:13.640 --> 09:16.880
 because the part I remember is the buildup, the anticipation

09:16.880 --> 09:20.040
 and then once you eat, it's over.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.040
 We kind of focus on the destination,

09:22.040 --> 09:23.400
 but it's the whole journey.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.880
 The whole like, even if you go to a restaurant,

09:25.880 --> 09:29.200
 it's the conversations leading up to the meal

09:29.200 --> 09:30.640
 and the first taste of the meal.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.520
 That's where the joy is.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.360
 And if you get to watch the making of that meal,

09:34.360 --> 09:35.400
 that's incredible.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.240
 That's where the smell, the visual,

09:38.240 --> 09:40.200
 how the ingredients come together.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.440
 And especially as we were looking over the fire,

09:43.440 --> 09:48.440
 like watching it, the fire play with the raw meat

09:50.160 --> 09:53.920
 and over time bring out the colors, bring out the,

09:53.920 --> 09:57.200
 I don't know, like you can visually associate the flavor,

09:57.200 --> 10:01.160
 you know, how it becomes a little bit burnt on the outside,

10:01.160 --> 10:02.800
 you know, it has a crispiness to it.

10:02.800 --> 10:03.960
 It starts to gain that crispiness

10:03.960 --> 10:06.200
 and immediately your past memories

10:06.200 --> 10:08.640
 of the delicious crispiness of various foods you've eaten,

10:08.640 --> 10:10.480
 they're somehow mapped into your,

10:10.480 --> 10:13.200
 and immediately you start to taste it visually.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.160
 I don't know, yeah, that experience is magical.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.760
 And of course, maybe it's the Russian thing,

10:17.760 --> 10:20.680
 but I'm almost like saddened when it's over.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.720
 I think fasting is gaining in popularity

10:24.720 --> 10:27.360
 because we're having to relearn the importance

10:27.360 --> 10:30.960
 of being hungry in anticipation and delight.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.440
 We have such a fear of hunger,

10:34.440 --> 10:37.920
 and that's really, you know, functional in evolution, right?

10:37.920 --> 10:39.320
 But we have this deep fear of hunger

10:39.320 --> 10:42.360
 and part of the great American experience has been

10:42.360 --> 10:44.520
 that we don't have to be afraid of hunger at all

10:44.520 --> 10:47.200
 because there's food everywhere and it's really cheap.

10:47.200 --> 10:52.000
 In all that abundance, we've lost this edge of hunger

10:52.000 --> 10:54.320
 and we don't let ourselves get hungry.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.120
 And that's one thing that I learned

10:56.120 --> 10:59.160
 and part of my journey as a cook and chef has been,

10:59.160 --> 11:01.640
 you know, moving abroad was the first time

11:01.640 --> 11:03.840
 when I lived out of the US,

11:03.840 --> 11:06.640
 was the first time that I regularly experienced hunger

11:06.640 --> 11:09.960
 because the time between meals was really long.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.200
 And that was just what everybody did.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.920
 And so I was hungry for two hours before lunch.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.400
 And that was the first time in my life

11:16.400 --> 11:19.240
 that there hadn't just been readily available snacks.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.760
 So I wonder if the intermittent fasting

11:21.760 --> 11:23.800
 and part of the popularity around it,

11:23.800 --> 11:26.040
 I'm sure there's all these amazing metabolic things

11:26.040 --> 11:28.640
 that are happening, but also people might also feel better

11:28.640 --> 11:32.320
 because they're really anticipating and enjoying food.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.840
 And then if you look at the feelings of fullness,

11:34.840 --> 11:37.360
 there's a really interesting thing that happens

11:37.360 --> 11:41.240
 when you cook and your sense of fullness,

11:41.240 --> 11:45.360
 which is if you cook and you're hungry,

11:45.360 --> 11:47.280
 the experience of being around the food,

11:47.280 --> 11:50.280
 smelling it, touching it, sampling it,

11:50.280 --> 11:53.640
 you'll take your hunger down by 40%.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.680
 And this is my own observation.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.080
 But as, I mean, we've all had the experience

11:58.080 --> 11:59.880
 of cooking Thanksgiving and the cook

11:59.880 --> 12:01.520
 never kind of wants to eat that much Thanksgiving.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.000
 That's an extreme experience.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.240
 But when you really dive in and you're cooking

12:05.240 --> 12:07.880
 for a few hours and you're smelling and smelling and smelling,

12:07.880 --> 12:12.080
 it totally changes your threshold of satiety and fullness

12:12.080 --> 12:15.560
 because of other sensory things that are happening.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.600
 And for those of us looking to, you know, to maintain weight

12:18.600 --> 12:22.240
 and something to consider in this is that cooking is also part

12:22.240 --> 12:25.000
 of the part of what your appetite, when you're hungry,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.040
 what are you hungry for, right?

12:27.040 --> 12:28.840
 So we tend to think about calories,

12:28.840 --> 12:31.080
 but when you're hungry, you might also be hungrier

12:31.080 --> 12:35.640
 for a wider range of things and it might be smells,

12:35.640 --> 12:37.800
 it might be stopping, there's other elements

12:37.800 --> 12:39.800
 and that's something, think as a cook

12:39.800 --> 12:43.800
 that it's powerful to explore and be with

12:43.800 --> 12:47.960
 and observe how your hunger changes when you're cooking.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.600
 Well, let me ask the romantic question.

12:49.600 --> 12:53.400
 When did you first fall in love with cooking?

12:53.400 --> 12:55.360
 Me falling in love with cooking

12:55.360 --> 12:58.760
 was about solving a problem in my family

12:58.760 --> 13:04.000
 and it had to do with my mom feeling very anxious

13:04.000 --> 13:08.520
 about cooking and overwhelmed frequently

13:08.520 --> 13:09.640
 when it came to meals.

13:09.640 --> 13:13.600
 And I'm naturally very good at juggling a lot of things

13:13.600 --> 13:17.080
 and it was just something I could dive in and help

13:17.080 --> 13:21.080
 and help my dad who's very, I'm very, very close to.

13:21.080 --> 13:25.320
 So it was a very functional role where I would see

13:25.320 --> 13:28.920
 this kind of crescendo of anxiety around mealtimes

13:28.920 --> 13:33.920
 as a kid and would be able to dive in and solve things.

13:35.720 --> 13:38.520
 And I also loved women who cooked.

13:38.520 --> 13:41.480
 Like my father's mother is a great cook.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.880
 She was, I remember her telling me as a kid,

13:43.880 --> 13:46.640
 I was asking her about church and why she went to church

13:46.640 --> 13:48.120
 and she's like, I mostly go to church

13:48.120 --> 13:52.240
 because I get to cook for the potlucks.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.800
 And so there was an openness around that

13:54.800 --> 13:56.160
 but she just loved to cook for people

13:56.160 --> 13:57.960
 and there was this real tenderness

13:57.960 --> 13:59.560
 and expression of that love.

13:59.560 --> 14:03.360
 So seeing women in my life who had this real tenderness

14:03.360 --> 14:05.920
 and love that they shared through food

14:05.920 --> 14:09.680
 and then also being able in my own home to kind of pitch in

14:09.680 --> 14:13.800
 and add value and help my mom and dad

14:13.800 --> 14:16.120
 was really powerful for me

14:16.120 --> 14:17.840
 because I felt like I had a superpower.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.080
 You know, I felt like, oh man,

14:19.080 --> 14:22.400
 I just made this stressful thing go away.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.480
 That was huge.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.320
 It's kind of interesting.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.680
 I don't know if you can comment on,

14:25.680 --> 14:28.440
 especially for me growing up in Russia,

14:28.440 --> 14:30.840
 it's probably true in a lot of cultures,

14:30.840 --> 14:33.120
 maybe every culture that food,

14:33.120 --> 14:35.160
 and especially like in a family,

14:35.160 --> 14:38.400
 the mother that cooks is the source of love

14:38.400 --> 14:40.160
 and like ties the family together.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.760
 It creates events where everyone comes together.

14:42.760 --> 14:47.040
 It's one of the only chances of togetherness.

14:47.040 --> 14:50.560
 The thing that bonds a family is like dinner

14:50.560 --> 14:52.520
 or food eating together.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.560
 And I don't know what to do with that.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.120
 It ties up with like dieting and so on.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.520
 When I was on stricter diets,

14:58.520 --> 15:01.080
 especially like competing and cutting weight and stuff,

15:01.080 --> 15:03.960
 it felt like I was almost like losing opportunity

15:03.960 --> 15:05.880
 to connect with friends and family.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.200
 It's interesting.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.000
 It almost like cultures,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.440
 we cannot fully experience love and family

15:12.440 --> 15:15.200
 without eating and on the flip side of that,

15:15.200 --> 15:19.000
 eating enables us to experience love and family.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.560
 I don't know what to do with that.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.560
 It's a tough one because there's lots of layers

15:22.560 --> 15:27.720
 around kind of gender roles and families changing and things.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.720
 I'd say I agree around the alienation

15:30.720 --> 15:32.280
 and I've done carnivore diet

15:32.280 --> 15:34.000
 and I've tried some of these extreme protocols

15:34.000 --> 15:36.400
 and I too, I suffered from loneliness.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.280
 You know, it was like doing carnivore

15:38.280 --> 15:41.840
 and not being able to eat what my kids ate

15:41.840 --> 15:43.560
 and talk about it at the same time.

15:43.560 --> 15:47.440
 Those pieces are real and I wonder with all of these diets

15:48.440 --> 15:51.320
 if that structure is actually helping

15:51.320 --> 15:53.280
 or just taking away from people's

15:53.280 --> 15:55.440
 kind of sensual understanding.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.120
 But I think that there's some rigor around that

15:57.120 --> 15:59.480
 that helps people discover what's good for them

15:59.480 --> 16:03.320
 by eliminating and then growing towards more intuitive food

16:03.320 --> 16:06.160
 is a good evolution from that base.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.880
 I love to cook for people.

16:09.880 --> 16:14.560
 I love to pay attention to their way of being

16:14.560 --> 16:16.720
 and read what they'd like to eat

16:16.720 --> 16:19.680
 and it's my purest way of love.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.680
 And that's for everybody in my life.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.120
 I actually love to cook for people I love.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.760
 You know, I don't, I would struggle to be

16:26.760 --> 16:28.000
 putting out food all the time.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.960
 It's like something for me, it's a real act of caretaking.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.760
 So I definitely have that in my makeup

16:33.760 --> 16:38.760
 and I definitely notice in times of like, of real stress,

16:41.840 --> 16:43.720
 that's the piece that drops off, right?

16:43.720 --> 16:45.920
 And it's like, if I'm unable to care for myself,

16:45.920 --> 16:47.280
 I have a hard time cooking.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.800
 So it's for me, it's very emotional.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.200
 It's very connected to love.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.280
 And individualistic.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.000
 So like focused on the particular individual,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.440
 it's almost like a journey of understanding

16:58.440 --> 17:00.600
 what that person is excited about

17:00.600 --> 17:03.400
 in the landscape of flavors, right?

17:03.400 --> 17:05.440
 Figuring that person out, what they like,

17:05.440 --> 17:07.160
 what they love to eat.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.400
 Yeah.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.760
 I see cooking for myself, I mostly cook for myself.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.840
 So I see that, it's almost a,

17:13.840 --> 17:15.160
 this is gonna be like the worst term,

17:15.160 --> 17:17.840
 but like an act of self love.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.000
 This is gonna be clipped out.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.080
 That like, it's almost an exploration of like,

17:26.080 --> 17:28.000
 what brings me joy?

17:28.000 --> 17:28.840
 And it's surprising,

17:28.840 --> 17:29.800
 because I usually don't share,

17:29.800 --> 17:32.680
 because the things that bring me joy

17:32.680 --> 17:34.200
 are the simplest ingredients.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.440
 Like I'm one of those people,

17:36.440 --> 17:38.120
 I don't know if you can psychoanalyze me,

17:38.120 --> 17:40.880
 because you also like basic ingredients.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.640
 I like a single ingredient to ingredients,

17:43.640 --> 17:45.560
 because I feel like I can deeply appreciate

17:45.560 --> 17:47.400
 that particular ingredient then.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.480
 I get easily distracted.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.360
 You know, people who are really good listening to music,

17:51.360 --> 17:53.000
 they can hear a piece of music

17:53.000 --> 17:55.720
 and in their mind extract the different layers

17:55.720 --> 17:57.680
 and enjoy different layers at a time,

17:57.680 --> 17:59.560
 like the bass, the drums,

17:59.560 --> 18:01.480
 the different layering of the piano, the beats

18:01.480 --> 18:02.760
 and all that kind of stuff.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.800
 That's what it means to truly enjoy music,

18:04.800 --> 18:06.680
 to listen to a piece over and over,

18:06.680 --> 18:08.560
 like almost like as a scholar.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.800
 In that same way for food,

18:09.800 --> 18:11.600
 I just can't do more than like three,

18:11.600 --> 18:13.280
 because then it's just,

18:13.280 --> 18:15.840
 I have to give in to the chaos of it, I guess,

18:15.840 --> 18:17.600
 but when it's just a basic ingredient,

18:17.600 --> 18:20.920
 like just meat or just a vegetable,

18:20.920 --> 18:22.760
 like basic grilled without sauces,

18:22.760 --> 18:24.320
 without any of that,

18:24.320 --> 18:27.240
 that I've discovered is what brings me a lot of joy.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.080
 But that's boring to a lot of people.

18:29.080 --> 18:33.760
 So you usually have to be kind of private about that joy.

18:33.760 --> 18:34.760
 So, but that's mine.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.040
 So yeah, I figured that out.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.560
 And I guess as a chef,

18:37.560 --> 18:38.960
 you have to figure that out

18:38.960 --> 18:41.880
 about everybody that you care for.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.920
 Well, also for you,

18:44.840 --> 18:46.880
 you're very interested in things

18:46.880 --> 18:50.160
 and interested in things being done well

18:50.160 --> 18:51.000
 and appreciating them.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.720
 So the single ingredient also allows you to control

18:53.720 --> 18:55.400
 for perfection and cooking that,

18:55.400 --> 18:58.280
 which is probably really appealing to you.

18:58.280 --> 19:01.760
 And I think sometimes I see people also in the beginning

19:01.760 --> 19:03.440
 of their journey of culinary,

19:03.440 --> 19:05.280
 trying to do too many things, right?

19:05.280 --> 19:07.000
 So there's another piece too,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.360
 that you'll notice, if you recall last night,

19:09.360 --> 19:11.200
 I grilled us the salad, right?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.520
 And then I did all those pieces separately.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.760
 And that's something in general

19:14.760 --> 19:17.680
 to be really attentive of when you're building flavor,

19:17.680 --> 19:21.680
 to make sure you pay attention to every piece separately.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.520
 The idea that you can,

19:24.520 --> 19:25.960
 okay, with a soup or something or stew,

19:25.960 --> 19:27.520
 there's workarounds,

19:27.520 --> 19:29.320
 but like to make a great dish

19:29.320 --> 19:31.480
 that's got four or five vegetables in it,

19:31.480 --> 19:33.640
 cook them all separately

19:33.640 --> 19:36.640
 to their optimal deliciousness and then combine them.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.280
 So that's another way to approach that,

19:38.280 --> 19:39.680
 is that you may also be able to look

19:39.680 --> 19:41.360
 at the different ingredients separately

19:41.360 --> 19:44.520
 and still have that sense of understanding of it.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.280
 But there's too often that we're layering together

19:47.280 --> 19:49.320
 like four or five things

19:49.320 --> 19:50.680
 and then cooking them all at once

19:50.680 --> 19:52.520
 and then surprise that it's not delicious.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.440
 Because you can't really optimize

19:54.440 --> 19:56.960
 on multiple variables at the same time

19:56.960 --> 19:58.720
 for peak awesomeness.

19:58.720 --> 20:01.200
 And that's actually the number one way you see this

20:01.200 --> 20:03.800
 is roasting a whole chicken, which is a really difficult,

20:03.800 --> 20:05.720
 it's the simplest dish, but it's very difficult

20:05.720 --> 20:08.640
 because you have the breast meat, which is bigger chunks,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.440
 they cook faster, you have the thighs and drums,

20:11.440 --> 20:14.200
 which are smaller and they cook slower.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.120
 To optimize that and pay attention to it

20:16.120 --> 20:17.280
 and do it all right,

20:17.280 --> 20:19.440
 you're actually solving for different outcomes.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.040
 So there's one example,

20:21.040 --> 20:23.560
 but oftentimes food is less delicious

20:23.560 --> 20:25.360
 with multiple ingredients at the start

20:25.360 --> 20:27.400
 because we're not able to pay attention

20:27.400 --> 20:29.760
 to how each one needs to end up.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.520
 So there's a way to parse that apart

20:31.520 --> 20:33.800
 and achieve a better outcome.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.200
 I don't know if you've seen Girodreams of Sushi.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.160
 It's a documentary about, yeah.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.320
 So there's an obsession,

20:41.320 --> 20:45.560
 that particular, first of all, set of humans,

20:46.480 --> 20:50.320
 but also the particular cuisine

20:50.320 --> 20:52.600
 that focused on the basics of the ingredients.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.520
 What do you think of that kind of trying to achieve mastery

20:56.520 --> 21:00.080
 through repeating the making of the same meal

21:00.080 --> 21:02.800
 over and over and over for like decades?

21:02.800 --> 21:06.160
 Like, do you find beauty in that journey towards mastery

21:06.160 --> 21:09.520
 or do you think it should be always an exploration?

21:09.520 --> 21:11.160
 To where you're always trying things,

21:11.160 --> 21:14.520
 you're always kind of injecting new flavors,

21:14.520 --> 21:16.680
 new experiences, all that kind of stuff.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.440
 I think you have to decide on a palette.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.920
 You know, if we're talking about an art,

21:20.920 --> 21:23.600
 it's equivalent to saying am I a sculptor or a painter.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.440
 Yeah.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.560
 That, the Sushi lexicon thing,

21:26.560 --> 21:28.880
 that's a very, very narrow, small canvas

21:28.880 --> 21:30.080
 that you're painting on.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.080
 And that is a beautiful road, right?

21:32.080 --> 21:34.760
 There's a beauty and a perfection to that.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.160
 It's like, I mean, there's many things culturally around that

21:37.160 --> 21:40.520
 that you could extrapolate specifically for Japan.

21:40.520 --> 21:44.400
 But I encourage people on the journey in food

21:44.400 --> 21:49.280
 to choose kind of a language that they're working within.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.280
 And if you want to step out of that occasionally

21:51.280 --> 21:52.960
 and have one or two dishes,

21:52.960 --> 21:55.240
 but if you want to get mastery with food,

21:55.240 --> 21:58.400
 you probably aren't going to be able to get more than say

21:58.400 --> 22:00.560
 20 ingredients that you use regularly

22:00.560 --> 22:02.400
 that you really understand.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.960
 And so we often see, you know,

22:04.960 --> 22:07.760
 I see the American pantry, it's got tons of sauces

22:07.760 --> 22:10.560
 and tons of spices and tons of spice blends.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.800
 And then really people only use just a couple of things.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.560
 And the idea that you can sort of splash out

22:15.560 --> 22:17.720
 and do Korean one night and then tacos the next night,

22:17.720 --> 22:20.640
 you can absolutely, but to get in a regular cadence

22:20.640 --> 22:21.600
 of specific ingredients,

22:21.600 --> 22:24.840
 you're probably going to get more mastery with that sooner.

22:24.840 --> 22:28.320
 And I think as much as you can do to get an understanding

22:28.320 --> 22:30.800
 of the, you know, the basics around salt and acid

22:30.800 --> 22:31.840
 and understand your palate,

22:31.840 --> 22:34.480
 like for me it's lemon and usually sherry vinegar, right?

22:34.480 --> 22:35.840
 So that's my acid palate.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.640
 And I, my fat palates, you know,

22:37.640 --> 22:39.160
 suet and butter, olive oil.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.760
 So you can sort of choose your language,

22:40.760 --> 22:42.280
 what you're painting with,

22:42.280 --> 22:43.440
 but I wouldn't splash out and say,

22:43.440 --> 22:44.360
 do I use sesame oil?

22:44.360 --> 22:45.520
 Yeah, every once in a while.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.960
 But that's not part of my base palate, right?

22:47.960 --> 22:50.800
 Well, can you say again what your fat palate is?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.680
 It'd be butter, suet and olive oil.

22:53.680 --> 22:54.520
 And olive oil.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.640
 So not white olive oil.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.280
 Is it your root's aniline?

22:58.280 --> 22:59.800
 I like the flavor for finish

22:59.800 --> 23:02.160
 because of the bitterness that it adds.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.720
 So I like the bitter and acid contrasts on meat

23:05.720 --> 23:07.640
 and vegetables, which is mostly what I eat.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.320
 And so I love that way,

23:10.320 --> 23:12.120
 that the bitterness and astringency

23:12.120 --> 23:14.280
 complements and allows the flavors to come out.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.880
 What do you think about coconut oil?

23:15.880 --> 23:17.680
 There's, I recently discovered that,

23:17.680 --> 23:19.720
 and there's a, I don't know,

23:19.720 --> 23:21.880
 there's a sweetness or there's something to it

23:21.880 --> 23:26.880
 that I really enjoy, maybe because it's new.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.640
 It's good with heat and I really love it for some reason.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.680
 As a chef, do you ever try it?

23:33.680 --> 23:34.520
 What do you think about it?

23:34.520 --> 23:35.600
 I like it in coffee.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.920
 Like I like it as a treat a little bit.

23:37.920 --> 23:41.400
 I find the flavor a little bit challenging in foods.

23:41.400 --> 23:45.120
 I also find that it's difficult

23:45.960 --> 23:48.120
 on the quality of that ingredient.

23:48.120 --> 23:51.240
 So I've found often that I buy a high quality coconut oil

23:51.240 --> 23:53.040
 and there's rancidity in it.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.120
 And I don't totally know why.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.440
 I think it's just the cold chain

23:55.440 --> 23:57.240
 and how that product's packaged.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.040
 So I've had some issues with product quality in that.

24:00.040 --> 24:03.040
 But for me, it's a little bit too much sweetness

24:03.040 --> 24:04.480
 in my foods.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.040
 But then again, I don't cook in like a Southeast Asian palate.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.960
 I try to not have much sweetness in my foods in general.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.000
 So just because of the palate that I like to cook with.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.080
 So for me, coconut's got a little bit too much

24:14.080 --> 24:15.920
 of those high notes and earthiness,

24:15.920 --> 24:18.280
 which is a nice combination, but it's more like a treat.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.600
 Yeah, it is almost like a treat.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.520
 It has a flavor of its own that almost stands on its own.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.080
 Like I could probably just eat coconut.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.440
 That's probably the only oil I could enjoy by itself.

24:29.440 --> 24:33.040
 It sounds weird to say, but it feels like fat is often

24:33.040 --> 24:35.520
 a thing that enriches the flavor of something else.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.360
 Coconut can almost stand on its own.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.040
 You might also be responding to that.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.760
 It's a complex flavor.

24:40.760 --> 24:45.760
 So there's an analogous, if you look at butter, for example,

24:46.600 --> 24:48.440
 a lot of the butter that we eat in the US

24:48.440 --> 24:50.320
 is just sweet cream butter.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.440
 It's not cultured.

24:51.440 --> 24:55.480
 If you explore like a cultured fermented butter,

24:55.480 --> 24:58.200
 maybe a grass milk, grass fed and finished butter,

24:58.200 --> 25:00.560
 you're gonna get a ton more complexity.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.800
 And so you may also just be responding

25:02.800 --> 25:05.080
 to having fats with more flavor,

25:05.080 --> 25:09.520
 which is the journey in the US has been

25:09.520 --> 25:12.800
 towards refined foods that are very neutral.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.720
 And then you have to combine more of them

25:14.720 --> 25:16.440
 to make things taste like things.

25:17.360 --> 25:20.000
 And so if you're coming from a background

25:20.000 --> 25:22.120
 of using mostly just generic butter,

25:22.120 --> 25:23.680
 let's say canola oil to cook with,

25:23.680 --> 25:25.320
 those are very neutral oils.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.720
 So you can also take some of your favorite fats

25:27.720 --> 25:30.080
 and look for versions of them that are more flavorful.

25:30.080 --> 25:33.360
 I mean, I love olive oil as a treat in a spoon.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.480
 Really? Like a good California extra virgin olive oil.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.520
 I'll eat a piece of butter as a treat.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.000
 That's like, or butter with salt on it.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.160
 Like good fats can, all of them can be,

25:43.160 --> 25:47.760
 if they're minimally processed and they're so delicious.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.960
 But there are things that you have to look for

25:49.960 --> 25:53.120
 a version of them that's got that full palette of flavor.

25:53.120 --> 25:56.720
 Well, for me, also the flavors are inextricably tied

25:56.720 --> 25:58.720
 to the memories I've had with those flavors.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.720
 So for better or worse, back when I used to eat

26:02.720 --> 26:05.480
 a lot of ice cream, I for some reason had a lot

26:05.480 --> 26:07.440
 of pleasant experiences coconut ice cream.

26:07.440 --> 26:11.240
 So that particular flavor just permeates throughout my life.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.800
 Now, like I'm stuck with it for better or worse

26:13.800 --> 26:17.440
 as a flavor that brings up pleasant memories.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.600
 And as I have a few such flavors,

26:19.600 --> 26:22.560
 I have such relationship with all kinds of meat too.

26:22.560 --> 26:25.080
 Like it's just so many pleasant memories.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.120
 And that's it.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.960
 Like you're almost tasting the memories.

26:28.960 --> 26:33.160
 And that there's no way to separate the flavor

26:33.160 --> 26:34.560
 from the memories, I suppose.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.800
 And that's a powerful thing.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.560
 What's your favorite meal to cook?

26:38.560 --> 26:41.440
 I'll roast a couple of chickens

26:41.440 --> 26:44.720
 and then I'll poach them, like I'll boil them

26:44.720 --> 26:45.560
 and let it cool.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.280
 That's a complicated one.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.760
 I'll let them cool down.

26:48.760 --> 26:49.720
 I'll pull all the meat off,

26:49.720 --> 26:51.720
 put the bones back into the pot

26:51.720 --> 26:54.960
 and then cook that for like three or four hours.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.120
 And then add in like shiitake mushrooms

26:57.120 --> 26:58.760
 and all the chicken meat.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.240
 And I'll throw in a bottle of white wine

27:01.240 --> 27:02.960
 into the stock as well,

27:02.960 --> 27:04.640
 bunch of thyme and garlic.

27:04.640 --> 27:09.640
 And I love it because it's the way the house smells.

27:09.840 --> 27:10.960
 It's very laborious.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.000
 It's soothing for me to spend time picking apart meat

27:14.000 --> 27:14.920
 and chopping things up.

27:14.920 --> 27:17.640
 There's like a lot of manuality around it.

27:17.640 --> 27:18.920
 So I'd say from a personal,

27:18.920 --> 27:20.240
 like I mean, I love grilling a steak

27:20.240 --> 27:21.080
 and doing those things as well,

27:21.080 --> 27:24.560
 but there's something about making a stock from scratch

27:24.560 --> 27:26.760
 and the way it smells, the way I feel,

27:26.760 --> 27:29.760
 the time it takes, the kind of checking in on it

27:29.760 --> 27:31.360
 that I really, really love.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.200
 There's many things that I love to make

27:33.200 --> 27:35.200
 that I don't even love to eat.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.560
 You know, I think you see this a lot in like baking

27:37.560 --> 27:39.680
 and bakers, people who bake a ton

27:39.680 --> 27:40.840
 and they love the process of it,

27:40.840 --> 27:42.640
 even if they don't eat that many baked goods.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.400
 So anything for me that's really like enjoyable

27:45.400 --> 27:47.240
 is typically things like making cinnamon buns.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.600
 I don't eat very many cinnamon buns,

27:48.600 --> 27:51.120
 but I love making them because it takes all the sort of

27:51.120 --> 27:54.160
 like fussing around and taking your time and watching it

27:54.160 --> 27:56.320
 and the way it smells, the way the house smells.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.840
 All of that stuff is like there,

27:57.840 --> 28:01.320
 it's like almost like a meditative exercise for me.

28:01.320 --> 28:04.400
 Is there a science, is there an art to cooking meat well

28:04.400 --> 28:05.920
 and the different kinds of meats?

28:05.920 --> 28:08.120
 Is there something you can convert into words

28:09.480 --> 28:14.480
 in to say ideas, how to bring out the best of it

28:15.520 --> 28:17.360
 out of what particular meat,

28:17.360 --> 28:18.400
 whatever steak we're talking about,

28:18.400 --> 28:20.320
 whatever beef we're talking about,

28:20.320 --> 28:21.760
 is there something that could be said?

28:21.760 --> 28:26.440
 The basic approach to cooking any type of meat

28:27.400 --> 28:30.440
 beyond the artistry of it is pretty scientific.

28:30.440 --> 28:35.080
 And it's what type of muscle is it in the animal

28:35.080 --> 28:37.240
 and what's the surface area to volume ratio?

28:38.640 --> 28:40.680
 Okay, so let's look at those two questions.

28:40.680 --> 28:44.040
 So the first piece is what's the type of muscle

28:44.040 --> 28:46.240
 in the animal, what's the functionality?

28:46.240 --> 28:49.120
 You don't necessarily need to know that to evaluate it,

28:49.120 --> 28:51.480
 but you need to understand, is it a tender muscle

28:51.480 --> 28:53.600
 that's not used very frequently in the animal

28:53.600 --> 28:55.160
 or is it a big load bearing muscle

28:55.160 --> 28:57.320
 that gets a lot of action, like the cheek, right?

28:57.320 --> 28:59.520
 Or the shin or those pieces.

29:00.520 --> 29:04.160
 The muscles like those along the spinal cord

29:04.160 --> 29:06.520
 that make up rib eyes and New York steaks and things,

29:06.520 --> 29:08.160
 those aren't very exercised.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.120
 They're right next to the spinal cord.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.640
 Spinal cord's doing most of the work there.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.680
 They're kind of like stabilizing muscles

29:13.680 --> 29:17.600
 around this big functional piece of skeletal structure

29:17.600 --> 29:18.440
 in the animal.

29:18.440 --> 29:21.120
 Other muscles like the ones around the diaphragm

29:21.120 --> 29:23.080
 with the flat iron steaks and skirt steaks and things,

29:23.080 --> 29:24.960
 those are really functional muscles

29:24.960 --> 29:26.720
 that are doing a ton and moving.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.640
 And if they're moving a lot, what happens?

29:29.640 --> 29:33.400
 Well, functionally, they've got lots of muscle sheaths

29:33.400 --> 29:35.400
 because muscles that move frequently

29:35.400 --> 29:38.600
 have to do a lot of like complex contraction.

29:38.600 --> 29:42.360
 That's why there's, in the cheek, for example,

29:42.360 --> 29:44.280
 there's tons of visible fiber

29:44.280 --> 29:46.680
 of like collagenous connective tissue.

29:46.680 --> 29:51.680
 That connective tissue is everything in how the meat cooks

29:52.160 --> 29:56.120
 because connective tissue doesn't respond to high heat

29:56.120 --> 29:57.560
 with becoming more tender.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.680
 Muscles do, right?

29:58.680 --> 30:00.680
 They can get a sear on them, you can cut them and eat them.

30:00.680 --> 30:04.080
 The collagenous tissue will glom up and get really tough.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.640
 So you either have to liquefy it

30:05.640 --> 30:10.120
 with really low, slow heat with moisture, right?

30:10.120 --> 30:12.040
 Or you have to barely cook it.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.480
 And that's the major piece.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.800
 So that's the question of like,

30:16.800 --> 30:19.600
 why wouldn't you just throw a brisket on the grill?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.400
 It's not about the fat, you can cut the fat out.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.240
 The reason you're not gonna throw a brisket on the grill

30:23.240 --> 30:25.400
 and cook it hot and fast is it's got too much collagenous

30:25.400 --> 30:26.760
 connective tissue in it.

30:26.760 --> 30:29.680
 Those are these giant muscles that have all this collagen

30:29.680 --> 30:32.000
 and these fibers and tendons in them effectively.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.080
 So you're never gonna be able to just cook that up hot fast.

30:36.080 --> 30:36.920
 So that's the first piece.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.480
 It's like, where's this muscle in the architecture

30:39.480 --> 30:42.120
 of the animal and then what does that mean

30:42.120 --> 30:44.920
 for what's going on in the muscle?

30:44.920 --> 30:48.560
 And that's actually more important than fat content.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.560
 We get really kind of, we pay a lot of attention

30:50.560 --> 30:52.480
 to fat content in muscles.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.640
 You can make a steak tender

30:53.640 --> 30:54.960
 if it doesn't have a ton of fat in it.

30:54.960 --> 30:55.960
 It actually has more to do

30:55.960 --> 30:58.800
 if there's collagenous and connective tissue in it.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.600
 That's fascinating, I never even thought about that.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.920
 I just, I thought it kind of universe,

31:05.920 --> 31:08.640
 I mean, adds to the texture of the meat,

31:08.640 --> 31:10.360
 the chewiness of the meat.

31:10.360 --> 31:14.280
 But you're saying it's also adds to how heat,

31:14.280 --> 31:15.320
 how it reacts to heat,

31:15.320 --> 31:17.800
 how the entirety of the meat reacts to heat.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.040
 And the fat is not as important to that

31:20.040 --> 31:21.200
 as the collagen.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.440
 The fat will make the flavor more delicious, right?

31:23.440 --> 31:25.720
 Like it'll add unctuousness and mouthfeel

31:25.720 --> 31:26.560
 and things like that.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.200
 But all the connective tissue in meat

31:29.200 --> 31:30.920
 and in some of the cuts that we ate

31:30.920 --> 31:31.800
 at a skirt steak last night,

31:31.800 --> 31:35.480
 you could see a web of that collagen sheath on the outside.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.840
 On a ribeye, that same collagen sheath is this big.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.360
 There's only one, it goes around the outside.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.840
 Okay, because that's just that muscle,

31:40.840 --> 31:42.920
 there's one large muscle fiber.

31:42.920 --> 31:46.600
 So that specific, it's a myelin sheath, right?

31:46.600 --> 31:49.840
 That material needs moisture and low and slow heat

31:49.840 --> 31:51.560
 to become tender.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.000
 The other side of that is that when it becomes tender,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.800
 it liquefies and it adds all this beautiful

31:56.800 --> 31:58.560
 gelatinous consistency.

31:58.560 --> 31:59.640
 That's what bone broth is.

31:59.640 --> 32:03.960
 That's why like a slow cooked pork shoulder is so delicious.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.760
 It's not that it's full of all that fat.

32:05.760 --> 32:06.640
 That fat's also great,

32:06.640 --> 32:08.120
 but a lot of that mouthfeel

32:08.120 --> 32:12.560
 comes from that really beautiful, dissolved collagen.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.400
 So when you're looking at like,

32:13.400 --> 32:15.640
 how do I understand how I'm gonna cook a piece of meat?

32:15.640 --> 32:17.560
 That first fork in the road is,

32:17.560 --> 32:20.160
 how is this gonna respond to heat?

32:20.160 --> 32:23.240
 And what's the appropriate cooking technique?

32:23.240 --> 32:27.320
 Then the second piece is that surface area to volume ratio.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.520
 And that's important because the heat is gonna impact

32:30.520 --> 32:32.920
 the meat through the surfaces of the meat

32:32.920 --> 32:34.640
 that are in contact with the heat.

32:34.640 --> 32:39.640
 So if I have a steak that's three inches thick,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.600
 I'm gonna cook it extremely differently

32:42.600 --> 32:45.720
 from a steak that's a half inch thick

32:45.720 --> 32:47.320
 or three quarters of an inch thick.

32:47.320 --> 32:48.640
 And that's the major,

32:48.640 --> 32:49.480
 and that's the truth.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.920
 If I have a piece of pork shoulder that's cut into cubes

32:52.920 --> 32:54.920
 versus having a whole pork shoulder,

32:54.920 --> 32:56.520
 that surface area to volume ratio,

32:56.520 --> 32:59.160
 that's gonna totally change how I cook it.

32:59.160 --> 33:02.720
 And same things like pot roast and a beef stew

33:02.720 --> 33:04.680
 would be the same cut of meat, right?

33:04.680 --> 33:06.480
 But how I cook them is gonna change

33:06.480 --> 33:07.760
 based on the surface area to volume.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.960
 Because you've gotta let moisture and heat

33:09.960 --> 33:12.080
 work its way into the center of the meat.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.520
 And that's gonna be determined by the amount of surface

33:14.520 --> 33:15.880
 of the meat that's in contact

33:15.880 --> 33:18.120
 with whatever cooking liquid or heat you've got.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.680
 Is there different sources of heat to play with?

33:20.680 --> 33:24.000
 Like a big flame versus a small,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.760
 or maybe even like almost no flame,

33:26.760 --> 33:28.360
 like over coals, all that kind of stuff.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.840
 Is there some science to the source of heat

33:31.840 --> 33:33.680
 in how it plays with the meat?

33:33.680 --> 33:35.960
 Well, it's indirect heat and direct heat.

33:35.960 --> 33:39.960
 And that really is mostly about temperature

33:39.960 --> 33:41.760
 in more than actual, I mean,

33:41.760 --> 33:44.320
 smoke is important as well that can permeate,

33:44.320 --> 33:46.120
 but really the smoke doesn't go into the center

33:46.120 --> 33:47.240
 of most cuts that you barbecue.

33:47.240 --> 33:48.680
 It'll come in like the smoke ring.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.880
 It's a, you know, it's maximum like half an inch

33:51.880 --> 33:53.560
 on the outside, maybe a little bit deeper

33:53.560 --> 33:55.160
 on a really long, slow cook.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.280
 So they, but the smoke,

33:57.280 --> 34:00.360
 that does create a ton of flavor on the surface of the meat.

34:00.360 --> 34:03.280
 But that's so the indirect allows you to have smoke

34:03.280 --> 34:06.240
 contacting it and then a very, very low and slow heat.

34:06.240 --> 34:11.240
 And what that does is indirect heat will be low

34:11.800 --> 34:14.520
 and slow enough that the center of the meat

34:14.520 --> 34:17.560
 will get warm at the same time as the exterior of the meat.

34:17.560 --> 34:22.160
 And it'll all cook equally and all get equally tender.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.440
 If you go very hot and fast,

34:23.440 --> 34:26.560
 you risk the interior of the meat not getting, right?

34:26.560 --> 34:28.840
 You kind of create a shell on it

34:28.840 --> 34:30.680
 and you slow down the interior of the meat,

34:30.680 --> 34:32.880
 which you actually want to do with something like a steak

34:32.880 --> 34:35.360
 where you want to keep it rare on the inside.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.360
 So it's really indirect versus direct.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.400
 Then once you get into direct heat, right?

34:39.400 --> 34:44.000
 Like in that category, there's wood, charcoal, gas, right?

34:44.000 --> 34:44.920
 That's about it.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.400
 And those are meaningfully different.

34:47.400 --> 34:48.680
 They're meaningfully different.

34:48.680 --> 34:50.760
 Charcoal and wood, that's more of,

34:50.760 --> 34:52.360
 there's more poetry in wood.

34:52.360 --> 34:54.280
 There's a little bit more flavor,

34:54.280 --> 34:56.080
 not functionally very different,

34:56.080 --> 34:59.200
 but gas versus charcoal wood is very different.

34:59.200 --> 35:03.160
 And that's because of the actual scent of the cook, right?

35:03.160 --> 35:04.520
 The scent of the flavor.

35:04.520 --> 35:09.240
 And then there's, I think an evenness of heat distribution

35:09.240 --> 35:11.960
 that comes off of charcoal, that's different from gas

35:11.960 --> 35:13.760
 because no matter how awesome your gas grill is,

35:13.760 --> 35:16.360
 you do have hotter and cooler spots.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.000
 So gas grills are typically,

35:18.000 --> 35:19.400
 you can kind of control for that

35:19.400 --> 35:21.600
 if you just are going really hot and fast.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.960
 Which is why gas grills are fine

35:22.960 --> 35:24.480
 if you're just like throwing that steak on,

35:24.480 --> 35:26.040
 get a hard sear on those burgers,

35:26.040 --> 35:27.760
 put a crust on it, gas is fabulous for that.

35:27.760 --> 35:28.760
 It's perfect.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.760
 When you're doing things that do better

35:30.760 --> 35:33.240
 with a low and slow cook,

35:33.240 --> 35:36.560
 like let's say a whole tenderloin or chicken thigh,

35:36.560 --> 35:40.000
 that's gonna be a little bit less elegant on gas

35:40.000 --> 35:41.560
 than on charcoal versus wood.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.200
 So when you have more kind of nuance in the low,

35:44.200 --> 35:46.640
 slow cook over the natural fuels.

35:46.640 --> 35:50.740
 Talking about like smoke and flame and charcoal versus gas,

35:50.740 --> 35:54.740
 it also adds to the experience and the smell

35:54.740 --> 35:57.540
 and the whole thing of the cooking

35:57.540 --> 36:00.060
 versus just like the taste it creates.

36:00.060 --> 36:01.700
 There's a certain experience to like

36:01.700 --> 36:03.180
 when there's a bit of smoke,

36:03.180 --> 36:04.700
 maybe I don't know what the chemistry of it is,

36:04.700 --> 36:05.940
 but I feel like with smoke,

36:05.940 --> 36:08.020
 the smell is distributed more effectively.

36:08.020 --> 36:08.860
 I don't know if that's true,

36:08.860 --> 36:13.860
 but there's a smell and a visual aspect of the experience

36:13.860 --> 36:16.180
 that's almost enriched with a bit of smoke

36:16.180 --> 36:19.020
 or like an open flame.

36:19.020 --> 36:20.340
 Like if you can see the flame,

36:20.340 --> 36:21.580
 there's a magic to that.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.380
 And it goes to the experience piece

36:23.380 --> 36:24.220
 that we were talking about before.

36:24.220 --> 36:26.020
 We were talking exactly about that,

36:26.020 --> 36:28.900
 like the nuance and the beauty of like that long,

36:28.900 --> 36:31.260
 slow cook and your house smelling like something.

36:31.260 --> 36:33.260
 Why do people freak out about barbecue?

36:33.260 --> 36:34.220
 Yeah.

36:34.220 --> 36:35.060
 Why?

36:35.060 --> 36:36.500
 Cause you go in and it smells bomb.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.700
 It smells so good.

36:37.700 --> 36:39.700
 It smells like heaven, right?

36:39.700 --> 36:41.340
 It smells fatty and delicious

36:41.340 --> 36:42.980
 and the smells everywhere

36:42.980 --> 36:44.580
 and everyone's smelling the same smell.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.900
 So there's like this collective experience.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.020
 It's incredible.

36:48.020 --> 36:51.540
 That's, I mean, I think that's why barbecue is so sticky

36:51.540 --> 36:52.380
 for people.

36:52.380 --> 36:53.740
 It's like so yummy

36:53.740 --> 36:56.660
 and you get this huge like anticipatory thing about it.

36:56.660 --> 36:58.740
 It's like, cause it smells incredible.

36:58.740 --> 37:00.820
 What was that incredible grill that we used yesterday?

37:00.820 --> 37:01.660
 What is that about?

37:01.660 --> 37:03.260
 That's called the Sea Island Forge.

37:03.260 --> 37:05.700
 It's a wood fire grill that's inspired

37:05.700 --> 37:07.740
 by like a South American style of cooking.

37:07.740 --> 37:08.820
 It's like, it's big.

37:08.820 --> 37:11.540
 It has also the things with the crank.

37:11.540 --> 37:13.980
 It allows you to control the distance from the flame.

37:13.980 --> 37:14.820
 It's awesome.

37:14.820 --> 37:15.900
 It's really key with the wood fire.

37:15.900 --> 37:20.740
 So when we evolved from cooking over wood to charcoal, right?

37:20.740 --> 37:22.980
 When that became more popular,

37:22.980 --> 37:25.340
 the reason that we did that is that allowed us

37:25.340 --> 37:28.660
 to skip the whole part of making our own charcoal, right?

37:28.660 --> 37:29.980
 So when you're cooking over wood,

37:29.980 --> 37:32.140
 all you're doing is making your own charcoal.

37:32.140 --> 37:34.900
 You don't ever cook over wood with the red fire.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.780
 Like we don't like throw a stake on

37:36.780 --> 37:38.580
 when the flames are orange and leaping up

37:38.580 --> 37:40.180
 because you're just gonna get, you know,

37:40.180 --> 37:42.500
 carbons like char all over your meat.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.020
 So you're, when you're cooking over wood,

37:44.020 --> 37:45.540
 you first cook down the wood,

37:45.540 --> 37:48.260
 you create the coal base, the natural coal base,

37:48.260 --> 37:49.460
 and then you cook over that.

37:49.460 --> 37:50.980
 So you saw yesterday I built my fire,

37:50.980 --> 37:52.700
 I let it burn down, added some fresh wood

37:52.700 --> 37:56.220
 so I could reinforce my coals with new coals coming in.

37:56.220 --> 37:59.160
 But then I was actually cooking over the embers.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.940
 You shorten that cycle with charcoal.

38:02.940 --> 38:04.380
 It's more efficient.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.580
 But what you lose is that whole cycle

38:06.580 --> 38:10.540
 of, you know, that really beautiful experience of smelling.

38:10.540 --> 38:12.140
 Now, if you're cooking on a Traeger,

38:12.140 --> 38:13.540
 you're gonna get awesome smoke smell.

38:13.540 --> 38:15.860
 You know, like there's plenty of ways to do this.

38:15.860 --> 38:17.020
 It doesn't always have to be wood fire.

38:17.020 --> 38:19.860
 And I love all the different ways, right?

38:19.860 --> 38:23.500
 But I really like the experience of the campfire.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.340
 And I love that kind of just like sitting by it,

38:25.340 --> 38:26.780
 building it, having to take the time.

38:26.780 --> 38:28.660
 I like building the fire, going inside,

38:28.660 --> 38:31.180
 preparing all my meats, bringing them out, cooking them.

38:31.180 --> 38:33.100
 That whole experience start to finish

38:33.100 --> 38:36.220
 is really just like something that is my favorite.

38:36.220 --> 38:38.660
 It's my favorite way to spend time, you know?

38:38.660 --> 38:40.100
 So I think, and why is that?

38:40.100 --> 38:41.740
 Is the food that different than cooking it

38:41.740 --> 38:43.540
 in a more conventional grill?

38:43.540 --> 38:46.020
 Probably not, you know, like in a pure experience.

38:46.020 --> 38:48.900
 But I think the actual experience is super memorable

38:48.900 --> 38:51.380
 because you are outside, you are slow in your role,

38:51.380 --> 38:53.060
 you're enjoying this, you know,

38:53.060 --> 38:55.900
 you're just taking in, you're watching,

38:55.900 --> 38:56.740
 you're anticipating.

38:56.740 --> 38:58.740
 I love that whole experience.

38:58.740 --> 39:03.620
 Does the origin of the meat itself make a difference?

39:03.620 --> 39:05.660
 So we're here at Belcampo Farms,

39:05.660 --> 39:10.260
 and maybe you could talk about what your vision,

39:10.260 --> 39:14.580
 your dream is in terms of like food,

39:14.580 --> 39:16.820
 in terms of where food comes from,

39:16.820 --> 39:19.100
 or meat comes from, but food broadly,

39:19.100 --> 39:23.340
 and how that affects the entirety of the culinary journey.

39:25.180 --> 39:27.380
 On the question of where does it come from,

39:27.380 --> 39:28.780
 and does that matter?

39:28.780 --> 39:31.780
 I'd say though, the way that meat is raised

39:31.780 --> 39:36.420
 is massively important for flavor and for how it cooks.

39:36.420 --> 39:41.420
 I think most cooks who try cooking grass fed

39:41.940 --> 39:44.460
 versus corn fed, that's the first moment

39:44.460 --> 39:45.820
 where they realize that, right?

39:45.820 --> 39:48.860
 Where corn fed meat cooks much more slowly,

39:48.860 --> 39:53.020
 it's got bigger veins of fat that slow the heat transfer

39:53.020 --> 39:54.940
 throughout the muscle of the animal,

39:54.940 --> 39:56.540
 compared to grass fed, which is leaner,

39:56.540 --> 39:58.260
 heat moves through it more quickly,

39:58.260 --> 40:00.220
 those steaks will cook much, much faster.

40:00.220 --> 40:02.860
 So there's very kind of technical reasons

40:02.860 --> 40:07.180
 why how meat is raised, that we're aware of,

40:07.180 --> 40:09.580
 and there's other things that I've noticed,

40:09.580 --> 40:13.580
 like that slower growing poultry

40:13.580 --> 40:16.700
 has a very, very different musculature and fiber to it

40:16.700 --> 40:19.900
 than fast growing poultry, that's confinement animals,

40:19.900 --> 40:22.740
 it has to do with the way that the muscles are built.

40:22.740 --> 40:26.020
 They tend to be finer and thinner and more tender,

40:26.020 --> 40:27.980
 and a little bit more susceptible to heat.

40:27.980 --> 40:32.260
 So the character of the meat's radically different.

40:32.260 --> 40:35.700
 It's also much more flavorful when it's grown more naturally.

40:35.700 --> 40:39.260
 And I think some of the reliance in the US

40:39.260 --> 40:42.220
 on sugary sauces and lots of salts

40:42.220 --> 40:45.860
 and flavors and things like that's actually based

40:45.860 --> 40:50.020
 on having the broadly available meat out there

40:50.020 --> 40:51.660
 is pretty low on flavor.

40:51.660 --> 40:54.420
 And so we're adding in a lot to compensate for that.

40:54.420 --> 40:57.900
 So to your point of enjoying things very simply

40:57.900 --> 41:02.020
 and with salt and nothing else,

41:02.020 --> 41:03.580
 the more flavorful that product is,

41:03.580 --> 41:06.540
 I think the more people will find that enjoyable.

41:06.540 --> 41:08.260
 Let's paint a vision.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.420
 I mean, you're a visionary.

41:09.420 --> 41:14.420
 You have a vision to have basically meat in every store

41:14.940 --> 41:19.140
 that comes from a farm like Blacampo

41:19.140 --> 41:22.340
 that's basically doing regenerative farming.

41:22.340 --> 41:24.140
 How do we get there?

41:24.140 --> 41:27.380
 It's about a network of smaller producers

41:27.380 --> 41:31.180
 working together with shared values.

41:31.180 --> 41:36.180
 And it's true that there's a limit on regenerative farming

41:36.980 --> 41:40.900
 in that it requires more human knowledge.

41:40.900 --> 41:45.380
 So regenerative farming is more difficult to scale

41:45.380 --> 41:46.900
 in a single operation.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.860
 It'd be really challenging to have a regenerative farm

41:48.860 --> 41:50.940
 that was like 200,000 acres

41:50.940 --> 41:54.180
 because of the amount of manpower needed to pay attention.

41:54.180 --> 41:56.220
 Can you first, and I apologize to interrupt,

41:56.220 --> 41:59.500
 but can you say what is regenerative farming?

41:59.500 --> 42:00.500
 Sure.

42:00.500 --> 42:05.500
 So if you're looking at scaling regenerative farming,

42:07.060 --> 42:09.220
 it's a traditional system of agriculture.

42:09.220 --> 42:11.460
 Regenerative farming is how we used to farm.

42:12.940 --> 42:16.300
 We used to farm with an eye towards the longterm.

42:17.540 --> 42:19.620
 You might be on the Friedman farm

42:19.620 --> 42:23.340
 thinking about your heirs five generations from now,

42:23.340 --> 42:25.140
 farming that same land.

42:25.140 --> 42:28.580
 Are you gonna lead that land nutritionally empty?

42:28.580 --> 42:31.180
 No, it's a longterm thinking.

42:31.180 --> 42:34.700
 Also in traditional ag, you don't have inputs

42:34.700 --> 42:36.140
 that are very convenient.

42:36.140 --> 42:38.060
 You can put some chicken manure on,

42:38.060 --> 42:41.260
 but you can't spray or dump something

42:41.260 --> 42:45.760
 that massively increases the growing potential of the land.

42:47.620 --> 42:51.700
 That was not available until the past 60 years.

42:51.700 --> 42:56.700
 So regenerative agriculture is an approach to farming

42:56.700 --> 43:00.820
 where you're increasing soil fertility through your farming.

43:02.220 --> 43:06.020
 You increase soil fertility by feeding the soil.

43:06.020 --> 43:08.460
 You feed the soil through carbon.

43:09.860 --> 43:12.300
 That's why regenerative farming is better for the environment.

43:12.300 --> 43:15.500
 It sequesters carbon and puts carbon into the soil.

43:16.460 --> 43:18.140
 Now it's interesting.

43:18.140 --> 43:22.060
 Plants need carbon and put it into the soil

43:22.060 --> 43:23.820
 when they're going through growth.

43:23.820 --> 43:25.900
 So if you have a beautiful field of grass

43:25.900 --> 43:27.460
 that's just waving in the wind,

43:27.460 --> 43:29.500
 that's not sequestering as much carbon

43:29.500 --> 43:33.100
 as plants that have been damaged and are regrowing.

43:33.100 --> 43:36.500
 Plants that have been damaged and are regrowing are repairing

43:36.500 --> 43:39.300
 and they're doing that by drawing down carbon

43:39.300 --> 43:41.100
 as one of the nutrients that feeds them.

43:42.100 --> 43:44.100
 To damage the plants effectively,

43:44.100 --> 43:46.740
 that's what we're doing with regenerative grazing.

43:48.020 --> 43:52.540
 So the cows or, you know, lambs or whatever out there,

43:52.540 --> 43:56.460
 they're eating and taking the grass down

43:56.460 --> 44:00.380
 and that then cause a regrowth cycle that sequesters carbon.

44:00.380 --> 44:01.740
 There's a limit to it.

44:01.740 --> 44:04.860
 There's an edge, because if those plants are so damaged

44:04.860 --> 44:07.580
 that they can't regrow, then it turns into a dirt patch

44:07.580 --> 44:09.260
 and that doesn't sequester any carbon.

44:09.260 --> 44:10.220
 So it's a balance.

44:10.220 --> 44:12.020
 How do you find that balance?

44:12.020 --> 44:16.980
 That has to do with the frequency and the scale of the grazing, essentially?

44:16.980 --> 44:17.980
 Exactly.

44:17.980 --> 44:19.980
 And so you have to find the right balance

44:19.980 --> 44:23.660
 and that connects to both the grass.

44:23.660 --> 44:27.420
 I mean, ultimately, the focus here is on the life cycle

44:27.420 --> 44:31.780
 of whatever is grazing, whether it's cows or lambs or so on.

44:31.780 --> 44:33.780
 That's why the scalability question.

44:33.780 --> 44:36.260
 So all that stuff that I just talked about,

44:36.260 --> 44:38.780
 think about all the actions that that requires.

44:38.780 --> 44:41.500
 Somebody's out there looking and paying attention

44:41.500 --> 44:45.180
 and understanding how far the grass is remembering

44:45.180 --> 44:47.180
 what happened in that field last year.

44:47.180 --> 44:55.180
 There's a huge human intelligence need and human kind of availability of attention.

44:55.180 --> 45:01.180
 Now, industrial farming has done a great job at de skilling agriculture.

45:01.180 --> 45:06.180
 Industrial farming has taken agriculture from being art science

45:06.180 --> 45:10.180
 to being entry level employment.

45:10.180 --> 45:11.180
 Yeah.

45:11.180 --> 45:14.180
 So that's the limiting factor on regen and that's why I think...

45:14.180 --> 45:15.180
 It's a human intelligent piece.

45:15.180 --> 45:16.180
 Exactly.

45:16.180 --> 45:19.180
 I got to ask, I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff.

45:19.180 --> 45:24.180
 I mentioned to you offline that I spent a bit of time with some robots and Boston Dynamics.

45:24.180 --> 45:27.180
 Do you think there's a way to use artificial intelligence to help?

45:27.180 --> 45:33.180
 So data collection, so automating some of the things that makes human special,

45:33.180 --> 45:36.180
 make some of that decision, some of that memory that's then utilized,

45:36.180 --> 45:39.180
 convert it into knowledge to make decisions about the crops and so on.

45:39.180 --> 45:41.180
 Is there a way AI can help?

45:41.180 --> 45:42.180
 Do you think?

45:42.180 --> 45:43.180
 Totally.

45:43.180 --> 45:45.180
 I mean, that would be incredible.

45:45.180 --> 45:48.180
 That's one of the ingredients that could help with the regenerative farming.

45:48.180 --> 45:54.180
 There's a number of discrete decision points that could completely be automated as well

45:54.180 --> 45:58.180
 in order to supplement and work with somebody like a farmer in managing it

45:58.180 --> 46:01.180
 about the performance on land.

46:01.180 --> 46:04.180
 And a bit of that's being done right now with some aerial mapping

46:04.180 --> 46:07.180
 but that type of AI would be huge in this.

46:07.180 --> 46:14.180
 I mean, there's estimates that if the damage and underutilized range land in the world

46:14.180 --> 46:20.180
 was converted to regenerative agriculture, somewhere between 20% and 40% of the world's carbon could be sequestered.

46:20.180 --> 46:22.180
 So there's a huge potential.

46:22.180 --> 46:26.180
 The problem is cultural.

46:26.180 --> 46:30.180
 We've lost the generational thread of knowledge about how to do this.

46:30.180 --> 46:34.180
 It's kind of been two generations that haven't farmed this way.

46:34.180 --> 46:40.180
 Also, the science around it is limited by the scale and longevity.

46:40.180 --> 46:45.180
 So the data collection around regenerative farming is also limited by the fact that it's kind of piecemeal.

46:45.180 --> 46:48.180
 There's small operations that are doing it.

46:48.180 --> 46:53.180
 They're learning and developing as they go and they haven't been documenting it and doing it for too long.

46:53.180 --> 46:58.180
 Is the ethical treatment of animals a part of regenerative farming?

46:58.180 --> 47:03.180
 So in the way you do things at Belcampo, that's a huge part.

47:03.180 --> 47:06.180
 Is that necessarily part of the life cycle?

47:06.180 --> 47:14.180
 The things that you're trying to measure is not damaging the land too much.

47:14.180 --> 47:18.180
 Make sure that the land is constantly healthy and it's producing.

47:18.180 --> 47:22.180
 And then the grazing process and also the carbon piece.

47:22.180 --> 47:26.180
 The fact that it's carbon neutral or something like that.

47:26.180 --> 47:32.180
 Are all of those pieces of the regenerative farming or is this an extra part to your vision that you're thinking about?

47:32.180 --> 47:34.180
 It's all implicit and regenerative.

47:34.180 --> 47:37.180
 I call it out separately because we are certified humane, right?

47:37.180 --> 47:41.180
 Which is another layer of welfare that has to do with density and a couple other things.

47:41.180 --> 47:44.180
 But regenerative, I mean, think about it.

47:44.180 --> 47:49.180
 If you're a cow and you're in a regenerative operation where the whole life cycle of the pasture

47:49.180 --> 47:52.180
 means that you only eat the top six inches of the grass.

47:52.180 --> 47:56.180
 And then when there's whatever a couple inches left, then that field is left dormant.

47:56.180 --> 47:58.180
 That's a better experience, right?

47:58.180 --> 48:00.180
 So just think about it kind of functionally that way.

48:00.180 --> 48:02.180
 Well, grazing period is a better experience, right?

48:02.180 --> 48:05.180
 And that's not what's done.

48:05.180 --> 48:07.180
 I mean, that's the grass fed piece, right?

48:07.180 --> 48:11.180
 That's the other piece with certified organics.

48:11.180 --> 48:12.180
 Amazing.

48:12.180 --> 48:17.180
 There's plenty of certifications that grass fed and finished is also great.

48:17.180 --> 48:19.180
 But there are workarounds for those.

48:19.180 --> 48:21.180
 You can have certified organic feedlots.

48:21.180 --> 48:26.180
 You can have grass fed and finished, which is in an animal fed a grass seed pellet.

48:26.180 --> 48:29.180
 Those aren't things that we do here, right?

48:29.180 --> 48:31.180
 And regenerative captures that.

48:31.180 --> 48:35.180
 If you're, it's anything, you're isolating these very specific certifications.

48:35.180 --> 48:37.180
 It doesn't have a holistic approach.

48:37.180 --> 48:40.180
 Regenerative though, unfortunately, isn't certified yet.

48:40.180 --> 48:45.180
 We've gotten USDA approval to use that word based on our carbon sequestration data,

48:45.180 --> 48:47.180
 but it's not a regulated term.

48:47.180 --> 48:51.180
 So that's kind of the mix right now is to figure out how to document it.

48:51.180 --> 48:56.180
 And it's not totally clear what it means like for pigs and chickens, which are omnivores.

48:56.180 --> 49:00.180
 It's very clear for ruminants, which are animals that have a room in that eat grass.

49:00.180 --> 49:05.180
 For omnivores, which is like what we are, they eat primarily grain in farming operations.

49:05.180 --> 49:07.180
 And that's a little bit more complex.

49:07.180 --> 49:13.180
 So it's kind of a moving landscape, but regenerative as a word is the better definition

49:13.180 --> 49:17.180
 of the whole life cycle approach of letting animals and nature work together.

49:17.180 --> 49:24.180
 Is it true that it's possible to have a farm that doesn't produce sort of, it's carbon neutral?

49:24.180 --> 49:30.180
 We have been third party verified to be carbon impact negative.

49:30.180 --> 49:39.180
 So Bell Campos 25,000 acres and the animals here, all of the carbon, including from our shipping on our mail order,

49:39.180 --> 49:43.180
 is all offset by the amount of grazing that's happening.

49:43.180 --> 49:45.180
 Also that encompasses our partner farms.

49:45.180 --> 49:48.180
 We buy a number of live animals in from other partner farms.

49:48.180 --> 49:50.180
 That's their impacts also incorporated in that.

49:50.180 --> 49:52.180
 I mean, first of all, that's incredible.

49:52.180 --> 49:54.180
 And second of all, is that possible to scale?

49:54.180 --> 49:57.180
 I don't see why it isn't.

49:57.180 --> 50:04.180
 I mean, it's complex to scale, but I mean, we're putting people on the moon and you have a robotic dog.

50:04.180 --> 50:08.180
 But that's less about scale.

50:08.180 --> 50:09.180
 That's more about innovation.

50:09.180 --> 50:14.180
 So like in many ways, what Bell Campos has done is innovative at a small scale.

50:14.180 --> 50:16.180
 The question is whether that innovation can be scaled.

50:16.180 --> 50:19.180
 That's where I feel like we in the industry need more help.

50:19.180 --> 50:29.180
 You know, the AI piece, the intelligence, the thinking about ways to do things differently is where we need more support.

50:29.180 --> 50:39.180
 And I think it's been a, you know, kind of a swing in the past couple of years where it's like meat's a mess.

50:39.180 --> 50:40.180
 It's terrible.

50:40.180 --> 50:46.180
 So let's ditch meat and are up for this hyper process, you know, plant based solutions.

50:46.180 --> 50:52.180
 And I am saying there's a way to make meat a part of the solution.

50:52.180 --> 50:54.180
 And it's going to mean eating less of it.

50:54.180 --> 50:56.180
 It's going to mean paying more for it.

50:56.180 --> 50:58.180
 It's going to mean that the farming systems are more complicated.

50:58.180 --> 51:03.180
 It's not the easiest path, but I think in the long term, it's the better path.

51:03.180 --> 51:05.180
 And it's also better for human health.

51:05.180 --> 51:08.180
 Can you comment on the certified humane piece?

51:08.180 --> 51:19.180
 So how do you run the farm? Like, what does it mean to raise an animal from the beginning of its life to the end of its life in a way that's ethical, that's humane?

51:19.180 --> 51:29.180
 I think the first piece you need to just be comfortable with is that making an animal into meat, you know, is something you're comfortable with.

51:29.180 --> 51:31.180
 Because I think that's the biggest question, right?

51:31.180 --> 51:37.180
 And so certified humane actually goes all the way through the death of the animal, how it's killed and handled at processing.

51:37.180 --> 51:43.180
 So I put that out there just to say, well, that's, you know, this is all about producing an animal to die for meat.

51:43.180 --> 51:47.180
 And that's not necessarily, that's something people struggle with the word humane.

51:47.180 --> 51:49.180
 And I understand that, like I have space and empathy for that.

51:49.180 --> 51:51.180
 It's a complicated decision.

51:51.180 --> 51:56.180
 And when you have to be comfortable with it, the outset to say, this is an animal that's going to die to feed me.

51:56.180 --> 51:58.180
 Yeah, so we should pause on that.

51:58.180 --> 52:06.180
 Because they actually just two days ago read a paper that argued that, you know, the killing of an animal period cannot be humane.

52:06.180 --> 52:07.180
 So it's impossible.

52:07.180 --> 52:11.180
 And so, and that's an argument just like you're saying we could make.

52:11.180 --> 52:23.180
 But if we now on the table kind of take as a starting point the idea that it's possible to kill an animal for food in an ethical way.

52:23.180 --> 52:25.180
 If we take that as a starting point.

52:25.180 --> 52:27.180
 So we won't argue about that.

52:27.180 --> 52:29.180
 It is worth arguing about it elsewhere.

52:29.180 --> 52:30.180
 And it probably will.

52:30.180 --> 52:35.180
 I will probably talk to a few vegan folks and we'll talk about the vegan diet.

52:35.180 --> 52:36.180
 I'm fascinated by it as well.

52:36.180 --> 52:38.180
 So I'm torn in the whole thing.

52:38.180 --> 52:45.180
 But if we just take that as a starting point, what then is an ethical humane way to treat an animal?

52:45.180 --> 52:51.180
 I look at ethical humane animal treatment as the major phases of life.

52:51.180 --> 53:01.180
 So conception, birth and mothering, diet, those are kind of the major touch points of life.

53:01.180 --> 53:12.180
 So what we're looking at is evolutionary approach, which means is the animal eating what it evolved to eat primarily?

53:12.180 --> 53:15.180
 Is the animal primarily outdoors?

53:15.180 --> 53:20.180
 Which is how all animals evolved given when the climate's appropriate for it.

53:20.180 --> 53:23.180
 There are certain, you know, times when you can't have animals fully outdoors.

53:23.180 --> 53:28.180
 Like here on our ranch, we have had issues with like, you know, cold weather and things.

53:28.180 --> 53:33.180
 But so if you have, you know, appropriate weather conditions, is the animal outdoors?

53:33.180 --> 53:36.180
 Is the animal able to nurture and engage with its young?

53:36.180 --> 53:40.180
 Those are the kind of key touch points, but it's really the birth of it.

53:40.180 --> 53:43.180
 Let me start this one from the scratch.

53:43.180 --> 53:48.180
 Okay, so when I'm looking at or when I consider what's humane setting aside the death part,

53:48.180 --> 53:54.180
 I look at the evolutionary diet, access to the outdoors,

53:54.180 --> 53:59.180
 and ideally spending the majority of its life outdoors.

53:59.180 --> 54:07.180
 Low density, so animals spread out and engagement with young social interactions.

54:07.180 --> 54:08.180
 And that's all kind of...

54:08.180 --> 54:09.180
 Social interactions is the cool one.

54:09.180 --> 54:16.180
 I mean, I also read an article that like cows, for example, have social, like they have friends.

54:16.180 --> 54:17.180
 Yeah, yeah.

54:17.180 --> 54:18.180
 That's fascinating.

54:18.180 --> 54:25.180
 I mean, that piece with the young social interaction with each other that at a basic level,

54:25.180 --> 54:27.180
 I'm sure that interaction is not as rich as humans,

54:27.180 --> 54:31.180
 but that piece seems to be part of the humane picture.

54:31.180 --> 54:35.180
 And you said also just a quick comment, evolutionary diet,

54:35.180 --> 54:39.180
 meaning the diet that they were evolved to have.

54:39.180 --> 54:41.180
 And that's pretty simple.

54:41.180 --> 54:44.180
 You can look at the physiology of the animal and figure that out.

54:44.180 --> 54:50.180
 So ruminant species are lamb, goats, and beef, and they have five stomachs.

54:50.180 --> 54:54.180
 They evolved eating really low calorie, high fiber foods.

54:54.180 --> 54:56.180
 That's why they've got all the stomachs.

54:56.180 --> 54:57.180
 They need a lot of processing.

54:57.180 --> 55:00.180
 You or I were to eat grass, we die in a week, right?

55:00.180 --> 55:02.180
 Our physiology can't handle it.

55:02.180 --> 55:08.180
 Cows were built and evolved to eat this very low calorie, very high fiber, very low density food.

55:08.180 --> 55:10.180
 And they walk around slowly.

55:10.180 --> 55:12.180
 They're moving constantly and they're eating it.

55:12.180 --> 55:17.180
 When we put them on a corn fed diet, that's the opposite of their evolutionary diet

55:17.180 --> 55:19.180
 and their systems really struggle with it.

55:19.180 --> 55:21.180
 Now pigs and chickens are different.

55:21.180 --> 55:30.180
 Pigs and chickens are omnivores and pigs will happily eat chickens, for example.

55:30.180 --> 55:34.180
 Our pigs on the farm will hunt and kill rattlesnakes and eat them.

55:34.180 --> 55:39.180
 They enjoy all of it.

55:39.180 --> 55:42.180
 They're omnivores.

55:42.180 --> 55:47.180
 I've seen people try to raise like a grass fed chicken that doesn't exist.

55:47.180 --> 55:50.180
 They need a higher omnivores, eat everything.

55:50.180 --> 55:56.180
 What's called monogastric, they got one stomach and that one stomach needs higher density nutrients.

55:56.180 --> 56:03.180
 So in the case of chicken, if you're to look back in American history in the 1950s,

56:03.180 --> 56:07.180
 commercial chickens took like 54 weeks to come to full weight.

56:07.180 --> 56:12.180
 Now it's two and a half weeks in confinement farming in our systems.

56:12.180 --> 56:14.180
 It's like eight to 10 weeks, typically.

56:14.180 --> 56:17.180
 So you have to give them some amount of nutrient density.

56:17.180 --> 56:25.180
 But there's the idea that no grain, because that's a misinformation for any type of commercial operation,

56:25.180 --> 56:30.180
 free range, regenerative, pastured, everything, you're going to have to have a grain feed to get any type of...

56:30.180 --> 56:34.180
 It's actually, I think for the case of chickens, unless you're in a place with like tons of natural seeds

56:34.180 --> 56:38.180
 and grubs and worms and stuff to eat, really challenging for the chicken.

56:38.180 --> 56:41.180
 So you got to give them some high density, high calorie food different from that.

56:41.180 --> 56:44.180
 That's the evolutionary diet is a really key thing.

56:44.180 --> 56:46.180
 That's the fundamental thing for health.

56:46.180 --> 56:50.180
 And it's also interesting because that the evolutionary diet ties to human health.

56:50.180 --> 56:54.180
 I've looked at the nutritional analysis on all of our products.

56:54.180 --> 57:06.180
 And it's the evolutionary diet is for the case of beef and lamb gets their omega three to six ratios the same as wild game.

57:06.180 --> 57:11.180
 So it's not like beef is really radically different from elk or ruminant species, right?

57:11.180 --> 57:16.180
 If you feed beef and evolutionary diet, their nutritional profile is the same as wild meat.

57:16.180 --> 57:18.180
 It's a wild ruminant.

57:18.180 --> 57:20.180
 I got a chance to witness Neuralink.

57:20.180 --> 57:22.180
 I don't know if you're familiar with that company.

57:22.180 --> 57:24.180
 Yeah, brain computer interfaces.

57:24.180 --> 57:31.180
 And they have I got a chance to see in person just a bunch of pigs who had Neuralink chips implanted and taken out.

57:31.180 --> 57:33.180
 Those pigs are so happy with life.

57:33.180 --> 57:34.180
 I don't know.

57:34.180 --> 57:36.180
 I've never seen a happier animal.

57:36.180 --> 57:41.180
 I mean, because they get to eat you because you were mentioning sort of diets and stuff.

57:41.180 --> 57:44.180
 They base pigs seem to love a lot of stuff.

57:44.180 --> 57:45.180
 They're easy.

57:45.180 --> 57:47.180
 They easily need to be happy.

57:47.180 --> 58:01.180
 I don't know if you can comment on your thoughts of, you know, exploring the capacity of the pig mind through some of this testing with Neuralink,

58:01.180 --> 58:05.180
 whether that's exciting to you, whether maybe on the humane side, it's a little bit concerning.

58:05.180 --> 58:14.180
 If there's something to be said on sort of like, yeah, I don't know if it's even the ethical side,

58:14.180 --> 58:20.180
 but just because of your connection to meat and to nature and understanding these living beings.

58:20.180 --> 58:22.180
 Well, pigs are incredibly intelligent.

58:22.180 --> 58:25.180
 So I'm not surprised that they're a subject matter for Neuralink.

58:25.180 --> 58:28.180
 They're smarter than dogs and they're empathetic and emotional.

58:28.180 --> 58:37.180
 And we'll go look at our pigs afterwards and see, but they're kind of like joyful and exuberant when they're in good health.

58:37.180 --> 58:40.180
 And so that makes sense.

58:40.180 --> 58:43.180
 I'm interested in open.

58:43.180 --> 58:54.180
 I feel that the kind of bleeding edge agriculture movement that I'm, you know, on the edge of in some ways, we're a larger operator.

58:54.180 --> 58:59.180
 But we as a movement have to, we have to get into the game.

58:59.180 --> 59:03.180
 We have to move forward in a way that allows us to scale if we want to be viable.

59:03.180 --> 59:06.180
 So I think there has to be openness to how that can happen.

59:06.180 --> 59:15.180
 And I also think there needs to be more thoughtful and noisy data about how regenerative ranching can sequester carbon.

59:15.180 --> 59:20.180
 I mean, thousands of American ranches are selling carbon credits right now.

59:20.180 --> 59:26.180
 The data is that valid and they're not selling carbon credits from like grassland that just got a fence around it.

59:26.180 --> 59:31.180
 They're selling carbon credits for verified data from animals assisting in carbon sequestration.

59:31.180 --> 59:38.180
 So there's got to be a way to get the tech community involved in ways to help regenerative agriculture scale.

59:38.180 --> 59:39.180
 In different creative ways.

59:39.180 --> 59:46.180
 And actually, that'd be interesting if like Neuralink somehow has, especially because Elon Musk is involved in Kimball Musk,

59:46.180 --> 59:54.180
 has his whole effort and appreciation of regenerative agriculture that I wonder if Neuralink has a role to play.

59:54.180 --> 1:00:08.180
 Like exploring the neurobiology of the animal, if that somehow will create innovations that lead to improved scaling of regenerative agriculture.

1:00:08.180 --> 1:00:09.180
 That'd be interesting.

1:00:09.180 --> 1:00:11.180
 But you're saying it should be open to all those possibilities.

1:00:11.180 --> 1:00:13.180
 I don't think, I don't know the landscape to know what.

1:00:13.180 --> 1:00:14.180
 Yeah.

1:00:14.180 --> 1:00:16.180
 But my sense is that it's very hard.

1:00:16.180 --> 1:00:18.180
 It's very hard.

1:00:18.180 --> 1:00:22.180
 And our farming operation to scale, it's been incredibly complex and challenging.

1:00:22.180 --> 1:00:24.180
 We now work with partner farms.

1:00:24.180 --> 1:00:25.180
 I see their operations.

1:00:25.180 --> 1:00:27.180
 They're incredibly complex.

1:00:27.180 --> 1:00:33.180
 It just seems like there's got to be a way to make some of these things simpler and easier to share information.

1:00:33.180 --> 1:00:36.180
 I don't know what that answer is.

1:00:36.180 --> 1:00:42.180
 What would be cool is if we can understand deeper ways to measure the happiness of an animal.

1:00:42.180 --> 1:00:48.180
 Because then we can optimize like certified humane could be literally an optimization problem.

1:00:48.180 --> 1:00:56.180
 Just make sure, as opposed to kind of using our project, our own human values, actually measuring what the animal is happy doing.

1:00:56.180 --> 1:01:04.180
 So understanding the pig brain might help us understand pig happiness and like reframe what it means for a happy animal.

1:01:04.180 --> 1:01:09.180
 And then maybe it's a lot easier to make a happy animal, to make the animal happy than we think.

1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:13.180
 And might have to do with a variety of delicious food in the case of the pig.

1:01:13.180 --> 1:01:16.180
 Is there something you could say about grass fed meat?

1:01:16.180 --> 1:01:19.180
 Is it all just out of my own sort of curiosity?

1:01:19.180 --> 1:01:22.180
 Whenever people say sort of grass fed meat is better for you.

1:01:22.180 --> 1:01:24.180
 Are all grass fed meat made the same?

1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:28.180
 Is there a different like, it's like the word organic.

1:01:28.180 --> 1:01:31.180
 Is there a lot of variety within that?

1:01:31.180 --> 1:01:34.180
 Like the way Belcampo does it, will the others do it?

1:01:34.180 --> 1:01:39.180
 Just more color if you could add to this whole word and what it means.

1:01:39.180 --> 1:01:47.180
 Grass fed beef has been on grass its entire life and you want to look for the words 100% grass fed or grass fed and finished.

1:01:47.180 --> 1:01:58.180
 Now, the challenge with feeding beef grass its whole life is that it gains weight more slowly.

1:01:58.180 --> 1:02:04.180
 Although beef didn't evolve eating corn and things, it can eat them.

1:02:04.180 --> 1:02:11.180
 And in eating them, it gains weight more rapidly and has like a version of like an inflammatory response.

1:02:11.180 --> 1:02:20.180
 If you actually look inside the rumen of the animal inside the stomach, it's like black and shiny inside compared to grass fed animals like greens,

1:02:20.180 --> 1:02:21.180
 smells like compost.

1:02:21.180 --> 1:02:25.180
 So the animals themselves, their whole physiology is damaged by that food.

1:02:25.180 --> 1:02:28.180
 But they also gain weight really quickly and they put on a lot of fats.

1:02:28.180 --> 1:02:33.180
 Like if you or me were to eat a bunch of processed food compared to eating a bunch of greens,

1:02:33.180 --> 1:02:35.180
 it's the same impact you're going to blow up.

1:02:35.180 --> 1:02:40.180
 So the problem for grass fed is getting the animals to gain weight.

1:02:40.180 --> 1:02:42.180
 They're getting a ton of exercise.

1:02:42.180 --> 1:02:44.180
 They're eating really clean, right?

1:02:44.180 --> 1:02:46.180
 And they're super chill.

1:02:46.180 --> 1:02:57.180
 So that's different from the animals that are kept still eating really nutrient dense foods and under a ton of stress, which is a confinement animal.

1:02:57.180 --> 1:03:00.180
 So are all grass fed meats created the same?

1:03:00.180 --> 1:03:11.180
 The diet, yeah, nutritional profile broadly, but the length of time that the animal lives is extremely important for the flavor of the meat.

1:03:11.180 --> 1:03:15.180
 We're taking our beef to 24 to 26 months.

1:03:15.180 --> 1:03:18.180
 Conventional is around 18 months.

1:03:18.180 --> 1:03:26.180
 So I'm always looking, you know, if you're evaluating grass fed animals, you want to get animals that are typically allowed to live for longer because their flavor is going to be better.

1:03:26.180 --> 1:03:28.180
 There's going to be a bit more fat.

1:03:28.180 --> 1:03:34.180
 And they're Omega ratios also very, very differently.

1:03:34.180 --> 1:03:44.180
 And I've seen Omega ratios, you know, on our farm, everywhere from one to three to one to one, you ideal is one to one game is typically one to one or one to two Omega three to sixes.

1:03:44.180 --> 1:03:48.180
 But in operations where you don't have year round grass, it's more complicated.

1:03:48.180 --> 1:03:51.180
 You know, you're feeding hay and you don't get that three to six ratio.

1:03:51.180 --> 1:03:54.180
 Omega threes come from green grass.

1:03:54.180 --> 1:03:56.180
 They're the fat in greens.

1:03:56.180 --> 1:03:59.180
 And so they're scarce and costly, right?

1:03:59.180 --> 1:04:06.180
 So you can have grass fed and finished animals that don't have that perfect ratio because maybe they're in a climate or for whatever reasons we've had to do it too.

1:04:06.180 --> 1:04:08.180
 During the droughts do hay finishing.

1:04:08.180 --> 1:04:10.180
 It's not optimal changes the ratio.

1:04:10.180 --> 1:04:12.180
 But so there's a little bit of variance within it.

1:04:12.180 --> 1:04:21.180
 I'd say though they the variance within grass fed is still small compared to the variance between conventional and grass fed.

1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:22.180
 Right.

1:04:22.180 --> 1:04:27.180
 There's definitely things to look for within it, but the real difference is between those two.

1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:33.180
 Also thing to notice is that it's not a verified word.

1:04:33.180 --> 1:04:40.180
 So grass fed means animals that have been on grass at some point in their life.

1:04:40.180 --> 1:04:46.180
 The way the cattle industry is in the U.S., there's segmentation.

1:04:46.180 --> 1:04:48.180
 So there's cow calf operations.

1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:56.180
 Then those calves get sold to stocker operations which raised animals in their teens basically and then those get sold to feed lots.

1:04:56.180 --> 1:05:02.180
 And so those three phases, that first phase of the cow calf is always on grass.

1:05:02.180 --> 1:05:04.180
 It's mother cows and mom cows are amazing.

1:05:04.180 --> 1:05:09.180
 They can thrive on anything and still put all their nutrients into their baby and their babies will be healthy.

1:05:09.180 --> 1:05:12.180
 So you never are putting mother cows on really premium pasture.

1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:20.180
 So it's usually just kind of like okay pasture, dirty life, if you ever see kind of like scrubby lots with lots of cows and calves on, that's a cow calf operation.

1:05:20.180 --> 1:05:31.180
 So there's also a loophole unfortunately where people use the term grass fed and they're actually referring to animals that at some point in their life had grass, but that might be pretty far in the rearview mirror.

1:05:31.180 --> 1:05:36.180
 So you need to look at that grass fed and finished or grass fed 100%.

1:05:36.180 --> 1:05:40.180
 That ratio of omega 3 to 6 is it changes in like a week on grain.

1:05:40.180 --> 1:05:41.180
 Wow.

1:05:41.180 --> 1:05:42.180
 So it's radically different.

1:05:42.180 --> 1:05:44.180
 Unfortunately, it's the same thing for you and me.

1:05:44.180 --> 1:05:48.180
 You could eat clean for a month, you eat junk for three days, you're garbage, right?

1:05:48.180 --> 1:05:50.180
 It's not like you can just like coast on that, right?

1:05:50.180 --> 1:05:51.180
 We know it.

1:05:51.180 --> 1:05:52.180
 That's like the same thing for animals.

1:05:52.180 --> 1:05:53.180
 Our physiology changes.

1:05:53.180 --> 1:05:58.180
 Food's the number one way we interact with our environment and our body changes really rapidly and dramatically.

1:05:58.180 --> 1:06:10.180
 So we know Belcampo and just the way sort of this regenerative farming approach of Belcampo and the sort of how humane is good for the land, is good for the animal.

1:06:10.180 --> 1:06:14.180
 Comment on ways it's good for the human that eats the meat.

1:06:14.180 --> 1:06:16.180
 Is this meat better for you?

1:06:16.180 --> 1:06:18.180
 Yes.

1:06:18.180 --> 1:06:27.180
 And this is where the kind of focus on the joy and animals doing yoga and all this sort of like cynical stuff about this type of agriculture.

1:06:27.180 --> 1:06:30.180
 Say just like set that aside.

1:06:30.180 --> 1:06:32.180
 It really is better for your health.

1:06:32.180 --> 1:06:34.180
 It's got a better fat ratio.

1:06:34.180 --> 1:06:35.180
 It's less inflammatory.

1:06:35.180 --> 1:06:37.180
 It's got higher protein.

1:06:37.180 --> 1:06:39.180
 It's just better product.

1:06:39.180 --> 1:06:47.180
 In the case of beef, it's lower in fat and that fat is a better quality and it's higher in poultry and pork is also higher in protein.

1:06:47.180 --> 1:06:49.180
 So all the nutritionals are better.

1:06:49.180 --> 1:06:52.180
 It's got higher density of vitamins, got higher density of minerals.

1:06:52.180 --> 1:07:05.180
 And none of this stuff is radically different than, you know, it's not like it's the product is black and white, but every metric meaningfully is better in the right direction across the board.

1:07:05.180 --> 1:07:07.180
 So why wouldn't you?

1:07:07.180 --> 1:07:17.180
 I hesitate to take anecdotal evidence as like final scientific conclusions, but it does seem I've eaten quite a bit of belcampo meat, for example.

1:07:17.180 --> 1:07:25.180
 It's just my body seems to respond like it's less bothered by it, meaning like less inflamed.

1:07:25.180 --> 1:07:31.180
 I just feel better because I mostly eat a meat diet and it does seem to be a little bit of a difference.

1:07:31.180 --> 1:07:34.180
 What kind of meat I eat, where it comes from.

1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:37.180
 I don't know if that's my own psychology also.

1:07:37.180 --> 1:07:46.180
 I mean, there is an aspect to like when you know that the meat came from a good place and all the ways we've defined good, you feel better about it.

1:07:46.180 --> 1:07:49.180
 And that has an effect like decreased stress.

1:07:49.180 --> 1:07:55.180
 So I'm a huge believer in that like outside of just nutrition, how you feel about the whole experience is a huge impact.

1:07:55.180 --> 1:08:07.180
 But it does feel like the meat itself is actually just leading to less inflammation for me or like less like the bloated feeling and all those negative effects that could come with me.

1:08:07.180 --> 1:08:16.180
 Versus like certain other ground beef that I eat like store bought chicken breast or steak, all those kinds of things.

1:08:16.180 --> 1:08:21.180
 My body's a little bit more, works a little bit harder to process that food, it feels like.

1:08:21.180 --> 1:08:25.180
 I don't know if there's signs to that, but sort of anecdotally that seems to be the case.

1:08:25.180 --> 1:08:27.180
 Omega sixes are a big part of that.

1:08:27.180 --> 1:08:29.180
 In the case of the beef, you eat a lot of beef, you love beef.

1:08:29.180 --> 1:08:36.180
 And so in a conventional beef product, it's a one to 30 ratio of omega three to sixes.

1:08:36.180 --> 1:08:41.180
 And it can sometimes one to 20, one to 30, but that's the wrong direction.

1:08:41.180 --> 1:08:45.180
 In our beef, it's, you know, as low as one to one.

1:08:45.180 --> 1:08:49.180
 So that and the omega sixes are what's part of inflammation.

1:08:49.180 --> 1:08:54.180
 Now, you know, the magic in animals is that they're incredibly efficient processors, right?

1:08:54.180 --> 1:09:01.180
 And in the same way that, you know, the body can protect us from, you know,

1:09:01.180 --> 1:09:04.180
 can process and take out tons of things that are toxic out of the environment.

1:09:04.180 --> 1:09:06.180
 I mean, animals bodies can do that too.

1:09:06.180 --> 1:09:09.180
 So the beauty of meat is that it can be pretty clean, you know,

1:09:09.180 --> 1:09:12.180
 things like roundup and stuff don't end up in the meat.

1:09:12.180 --> 1:09:18.180
 When we have antibiotics in our meat, we're not worried about getting like tetracycline from the chicken breast.

1:09:18.180 --> 1:09:21.180
 What we're worried about is the workers getting tetracycline,

1:09:21.180 --> 1:09:26.180
 the chicken growing faster than it should, the meat being chewier and not as high quality.

1:09:26.180 --> 1:09:30.180
 But the actual antibiotics don't, the animals, great at filtering that, right?

1:09:30.180 --> 1:09:31.180
 They get that out.

1:09:31.180 --> 1:09:35.180
 So you have to think about meat not as like contamination of like,

1:09:35.180 --> 1:09:39.180
 oh, there's going to be some of that garbage they used in the farming in my meat.

1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:41.180
 But it's the more subtle things.

1:09:41.180 --> 1:09:42.180
 It's the fat ratio.

1:09:42.180 --> 1:09:43.180
 It's the protein density.

1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:52.180
 And there's also just, I think in my experience, there's just more complex flavor and things that taste more complex.

1:09:52.180 --> 1:09:54.180
 This is, you know, science backs this up.

1:09:54.180 --> 1:09:56.180
 They fill you up faster.

1:09:56.180 --> 1:10:03.180
 So if you're looking to limit, you know, to eat for fullness and but not eat as many calories,

1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:06.180
 more complex foods are the way to do that.

1:10:06.180 --> 1:10:10.180
 And that hit, you know, you hit your satiety, help you hit that satiety.

1:10:10.180 --> 1:10:16.180
 So things like, I mean, all the key, you know, amino acids that help you feel full, mostly from meat, right?

1:10:16.180 --> 1:10:19.180
 So those are, that's part of it, like it, but all meats have those.

1:10:19.180 --> 1:10:25.180
 Then there's other kind of micronutrients and things around that complex flavor that help you feel full faster.

1:10:25.180 --> 1:10:30.180
 Forgive me for this question, but it is kind of an interesting one that people are curious about.

1:10:30.180 --> 1:10:38.180
 What does it feel like to be a, what does it take to be a woman CEO of a meat company?

1:10:38.180 --> 1:10:45.180
 I mean, you're no longer CEO of Bel Campo, but you did, you ran, you co founded Bel Campo, you ran it for many, many years.

1:10:45.180 --> 1:10:51.180
 Is there something that you could say in terms of challenges associated with that?

1:10:51.180 --> 1:10:54.180
 And how did you personally overcome it?

1:10:54.180 --> 1:11:02.180
 So to be a female running a meat and livestock operation, it felt very alone.

1:11:02.180 --> 1:11:11.180
 A lot, you know, for a long time, I felt very like everybody waiting for me to fail

1:11:11.180 --> 1:11:17.180
 or watching and assuming that I was like just good at marketing or whatever else.

1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:27.180
 And so it's taken me a while to not internalize that.

1:11:27.180 --> 1:11:34.180
 I think the only reason I'm here is we have our own supply chain in Slaughterhouse.

1:11:34.180 --> 1:11:38.180
 And I think had I really been playing in the broader meat industry, it would have been a shorter journey.

1:11:38.180 --> 1:11:44.180
 You know, it would have been very hard to make it even get to this phase.

1:11:44.180 --> 1:11:59.180
 But I do, you know, I think the mission is my life's work, the mission of cleaner ingredients that taste so amazing.

1:11:59.180 --> 1:12:02.180
 You don't need to do too much to them.

1:12:02.180 --> 1:12:07.180
 You know, I like creating food that's in support of good health.

1:12:07.180 --> 1:12:13.180
 And then secondary to that, it's the environment, but I like to want healthy food to be a joy to eat, right?

1:12:13.180 --> 1:12:26.180
 And that's, you know, creating innovation in the space for this company has been about building a brand that people understand and is transparent

1:12:26.180 --> 1:12:30.180
 and that people believe in in an industry that's broadly perceived as pretty corrupt.

1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:33.180
 So those are the things I feel enormously proud of.

1:12:33.180 --> 1:12:40.180
 So you focused on the mission, the pushback, all the mess of the industry.

1:12:40.180 --> 1:12:44.180
 You try not to internalize it, try not to let it affect you and focus on the mission.

1:12:44.180 --> 1:12:51.180
 You know, and it's in the joy of it and the part where it's gotten fun for me has been returning to what I love about it.

1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:55.180
 And I've only had the privilege of doing that pretty recently.

1:12:55.180 --> 1:13:03.180
 So I think for me personally, you know, starting, I host these events on the farm called meat camps where I cook and teach people to cook

1:13:03.180 --> 1:13:10.180
 and, you know, taste and talk about flavor and all the, like, sensual aspects of it that are my fire.

1:13:10.180 --> 1:13:14.180
 Like, thank goodness I did that stuff because otherwise it was just such a beating.

1:13:14.180 --> 1:13:17.180
 You know, so there were parts of it where I got to feed my fire.

1:13:17.180 --> 1:13:22.180
 And then now in the, you know, the past year since resigning, I've been, I do all the recipe development.

1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:23.180
 I shoot all the content.

1:13:23.180 --> 1:13:26.180
 I, you know, taste product, I'm developing all of our new products.

1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:27.180
 I launched our meatballs.

1:13:27.180 --> 1:13:31.180
 I'm just about to launch our chicken meatballs doing a high protein bone broth.

1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:37.180
 Like those are, that's what, why I did this was to be able to build this great product that I could build on.

1:13:37.180 --> 1:13:41.180
 So I'm kind of at that place now, but it's taken a lot longer.

1:13:41.180 --> 1:13:52.180
 And I think, you know, looking at the landscape of what to do in food, this is definitely, we tackled the most complicated problem.

1:13:52.180 --> 1:13:57.180
 And I can imagine, you know, I did it like in the most old fashioned way, right?

1:13:57.180 --> 1:13:59.180
 So it's been super complex.

1:13:59.180 --> 1:14:03.180
 And then I also look at it and I'm like, yeah, and it's been messy and it's going to continue to be hard.

1:14:03.180 --> 1:14:06.180
 But I'm proud of having tackled the hard problems.

1:14:06.180 --> 1:14:10.180
 So the hard problem here is not in the space of technologies.

1:14:10.180 --> 1:14:23.180
 It's in the space of bringing something that we've done for a long, long time in our human history and scaling it in the face of all the other economic pressures.

1:14:23.180 --> 1:14:29.180
 Like doing so successfully, also communicating to the rest of the world that this is a powerful solution.

1:14:29.180 --> 1:14:39.180
 So inspiring the rest of the world that regenerative farming, like running a company in this kind of way that's humane for animals, good for the land, good for people.

1:14:39.180 --> 1:14:48.180
 Even if it costs, like if there's an increased cost to the meat, even if that, if you have a broader vision, that means eating less meat overall.

1:14:48.180 --> 1:14:54.180
 That that is like inspiring the world that this is a future we want.

1:14:54.180 --> 1:14:58.180
 And just taking that on and getting that done.

1:14:58.180 --> 1:15:06.180
 Got a chance to eat a little bit of cheese, which is a good opportunity to talk about your experience in Italy.

1:15:06.180 --> 1:15:09.180
 He spent some time, or South of Europe, I'm not sure if it was Italy.

1:15:09.180 --> 1:15:11.180
 Yeah, I lived in Italy.

1:15:11.180 --> 1:15:14.180
 And there's cheese involved, right?

1:15:14.180 --> 1:15:21.180
 Like what did you take away from that experience, both as a chef and as a human being?

1:15:21.180 --> 1:15:28.180
 I moved to Europe right after my early 20s, and I worked as a cheese maker.

1:15:28.180 --> 1:15:39.180
 And I lived in really small rural farms in the countryside, and I got up early and milked animals, made cheese.

1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:48.180
 And I got to live in a traditional agricultural society and learn how they ate.

1:15:48.180 --> 1:15:59.180
 So it shaped me as a cook because it was a chance to have incredible ingredients, learn how to cook very simple food.

1:15:59.180 --> 1:16:04.180
 I had been immersed in thought that I wanted to be like a chefy chef, right?

1:16:04.180 --> 1:16:08.180
 Because I love food and I love cooking and I was just drawn to that world.

1:16:08.180 --> 1:16:17.180
 But I don't like the experience of that sort of like fancy food experience is not what is exciting for me about it.

1:16:17.180 --> 1:16:26.180
 So I loved working in that environment because I got to eat lunches and dinners and everything with the farm that I lived on.

1:16:26.180 --> 1:16:31.180
 And just a very traditional, simple way to eat.

1:16:31.180 --> 1:16:37.180
 The other piece of it is, you know, I went to high school in the 90s, a child of like the low fat generation, right?

1:16:37.180 --> 1:16:43.180
 And it was just really liberating and amazing to eat tons of super fatty foods.

1:16:43.180 --> 1:16:50.180
 And olive oil all over the place and bleak slabs of bread and salami and being this like vibrant health.

1:16:50.180 --> 1:16:57.180
 Like be leaner, you know, happy, no skin stuff, you know, stop getting split ends.

1:16:57.180 --> 1:16:59.180
 Like I stopped having flaky nails.

1:16:59.180 --> 1:17:04.180
 Like just stuff that had bothered me my whole life, including like just moodiness.

1:17:04.180 --> 1:17:06.180
 And that all just changed.

1:17:06.180 --> 1:17:10.180
 Granted, I was also like living on a farm in Italy and getting up with the sunlight.

1:17:10.180 --> 1:17:15.180
 And like there are lots of great aspects of my life as well that happened in that time.

1:17:15.180 --> 1:17:20.180
 But I was just immersed in this diet that I realized like, man, this is so simple.

1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:30.180
 And I also loved that I had like, you know, you'd have dinner and it was just like some ricotta cheese with some olive oil, some bread and like a bowl of fava beans.

1:17:30.180 --> 1:17:38.180
 It's like that's dinner and it kind of broke down my assumptions too about like dinner always has to be this, you know, a protein and a vegetable.

1:17:38.180 --> 1:17:43.180
 And you know, being more fluid and more seasonal was exciting for me.

1:17:43.180 --> 1:17:57.180
 So I just learned kind of a lot about paying attention to food, simple preparation and the vibrancy of health that I personally experienced kind of made me double down on that.

1:17:57.180 --> 1:18:05.180
 Our mutual friend, Andrew Hewerin, mentioned something offline to me about something involving the mob.

1:18:05.180 --> 1:18:11.180
 Is there something you could share or are people going to hurt if you share this?

1:18:11.180 --> 1:18:13.180
 It's far enough in the rearview mirror.

1:18:13.180 --> 1:18:23.180
 I mean, I was hired by this group in Sicily on and this is, you know, is all of like 21 years old.

1:18:23.180 --> 1:18:29.180
 And to get a permit to work there, you have to show that you have a competency that nobody else in Italy has.

1:18:29.180 --> 1:18:33.180
 And that competency for Anya Fernald at the time was cheese expert.

1:18:33.180 --> 1:18:37.180
 So it was like, stupid American girl being like going to the consulate.

1:18:37.180 --> 1:18:40.180
 So I already knew that it was like there was something wobbly about this organization.

1:18:40.180 --> 1:18:48.180
 But I went to work for them and my boss from that time did end up in federal prison for corruption.

1:18:48.180 --> 1:18:53.180
 Many years later, embezzlement primarily.

1:18:53.180 --> 1:18:59.180
 So I was definitely in an environment that was answering to multiple masters.

1:18:59.180 --> 1:19:09.180
 And it was, I couldn't have asked for a better way to kind of get with life and understand how things happen in the world though.

1:19:09.180 --> 1:19:17.180
 You know, of learning as somebody who tends to be super direct and not very subtle.

1:19:17.180 --> 1:19:22.180
 It was amazing to be in this world where like everybody communicates in multiple levels.

1:19:22.180 --> 1:19:26.180
 Like my, we're going to lunch with my boss, with somebody we're going to do a business deal with.

1:19:26.180 --> 1:19:34.180
 And by the, they ordered a glass of wine and with that order communicated like disappointment.

1:19:34.180 --> 1:19:35.180
 Yeah.

1:19:35.180 --> 1:19:39.180
 Because that the father, the person who had made that wine had offended that other guys.

1:19:39.180 --> 1:19:40.180
 Yeah.

1:19:40.180 --> 1:19:42.180
 And like that level of stuff where like nothing happened directly.

1:19:42.180 --> 1:19:43.180
 I'm like, what are we talking about afterwards?

1:19:43.180 --> 1:19:44.180
 I'm like, what happened at lunch?

1:19:44.180 --> 1:19:48.180
 It's like, oh, I just, you know, I told him this by ordering that whatever, you know, that kind of thing.

1:19:48.180 --> 1:19:51.180
 And so understanding that there's different ways of communicating.

1:19:51.180 --> 1:19:56.180
 But it was also, you know, it was interesting to see.

1:19:56.180 --> 1:20:00.180
 And I think I, you know, it's kind of the struggle that I've lived again and again in my life.

1:20:00.180 --> 1:20:09.180
 Fundamentally, what we were doing in that operation was there's a very traditional cheese called the raguzano cheese in southeast Sicily, where I lived Ragusa.

1:20:09.180 --> 1:20:11.180
 And it was about scaling that operation.

1:20:11.180 --> 1:20:16.180
 So it was European Union money that my boss was also unfortunately using for other things.

1:20:16.180 --> 1:20:22.180
 But fundamentally, it was to take that this type of very small scale cheese, get them exported, help them scale.

1:20:22.180 --> 1:20:23.180
 And we did it.

1:20:23.180 --> 1:20:24.180
 And it was really challenging.

1:20:24.180 --> 1:20:31.180
 And I learned a lot about the safety issues and collaboration issues and grading groups of farmers for scale.

1:20:31.180 --> 1:20:33.180
 So kind of been doing the same thing again and again.

1:20:33.180 --> 1:20:44.180
 But Sicily, it, you know, it was also just the first place where I would regularly forage for food.

1:20:44.180 --> 1:20:52.180
 You know, like there, I'd go to friends houses and we'd like go out and pick nettles or go out and pick wild asparagus.

1:20:52.180 --> 1:20:54.180
 So every season there was stuff that you would be gathering.

1:20:54.180 --> 1:20:55.180
 And that was just part of how you lived.

1:20:55.180 --> 1:20:57.180
 And it was part of your health.

1:20:57.180 --> 1:21:10.180
 So that was that just learned a ton in that time about like simple eating and really that healthy food, the simpler it is, the better.

1:21:10.180 --> 1:21:11.180
 Right.

1:21:11.180 --> 1:21:16.180
 Like this sort of sense that healthy food isn't in a tiny packaged granola bar, lots of labels, lots of powders.

1:21:16.180 --> 1:21:19.180
 It's like the more simple, essential, closer to the land can actually lead to optimal health.

1:21:19.180 --> 1:21:25.180
 You've learned to appreciate the simplicity of food, the beauty within the simplicity.

1:21:25.180 --> 1:21:30.180
 I think it's because it was the first time that I had amazing food quality.

1:21:30.180 --> 1:21:31.180
 Okay.

1:21:31.180 --> 1:21:35.180
 Because in the where I grew up, there wasn't that food quality.

1:21:35.180 --> 1:21:37.180
 Like I had some stuff from my garden and things that were great.

1:21:37.180 --> 1:21:44.180
 But that's the kind of place where when artichokes in season, all of a sudden there's guys selling artichokes on their bicycles in the street.

1:21:44.180 --> 1:21:48.180
 And they're just fresh picked and you get that one thing or the torpedo onions or they like.

1:21:48.180 --> 1:21:53.180
 So there's a seasonality and celebration of things in their peak moment and you just have that one thing.

1:21:53.180 --> 1:21:56.180
 And that was the first time I'd ever eaten in that way.

1:21:56.180 --> 1:21:59.180
 You were a judge several times on Iron Chef.

1:21:59.180 --> 1:22:02.180
 How do you judge a good meal?

1:22:02.180 --> 1:22:06.180
 Like what, your own, other people's?

1:22:06.180 --> 1:22:09.180
 Like what rating system is good?

1:22:09.180 --> 1:22:15.180
 I mean, I go on experience and think about how many of your like most memorable, fantastic meals are like three star Michelin meals.

1:22:15.180 --> 1:22:17.180
 It's more about the experience, right?

1:22:17.180 --> 1:22:20.180
 It's more about that slow down, who are you with?

1:22:20.180 --> 1:22:23.180
 And some of our best meals are like the most simple things.

1:22:23.180 --> 1:22:27.180
 So Iron Chef, you know, those are, those were fun experiences.

1:22:27.180 --> 1:22:29.180
 It's a lot of sous vide though.

1:22:29.180 --> 1:22:31.180
 It's a lot of sauces.

1:22:31.180 --> 1:22:32.180
 It's a lot of powders.

1:22:32.180 --> 1:22:34.180
 I mean, it's kind of like magic food.

1:22:34.180 --> 1:22:38.180
 So that's not, I mean, it's incredible to watch it as science.

1:22:38.180 --> 1:22:41.180
 But I don't know if those are my most memorable meals.

1:22:41.180 --> 1:22:45.180
 So the experience is how you judge a good meal for you personally.

1:22:45.180 --> 1:22:55.180
 If you are a judge of the entirety of the human experience in terms of the culinary journey, that would be like the people you're eating with, the environment,

1:22:55.180 --> 1:23:00.180
 like how you feel, the journey, building up to that meal, like the whole thing.

1:23:00.180 --> 1:23:01.180
 You can't separate it up.

1:23:01.180 --> 1:23:10.180
 When I was learning as an apprentice cheese maker in Greece, one of the best meals in my life is like a bowl of cold,

1:23:10.180 --> 1:23:15.180
 milk yogurt with like a crust of cold fat on top.

1:23:15.180 --> 1:23:18.180
 So like the way that these fatty, you know, sheep milk can have double the percentage of fat than cow milk.

1:23:18.180 --> 1:23:23.180
 So like there's the yogurt and then there's this crust of fat and then they pour the fresh honey over the top.

1:23:23.180 --> 1:23:28.180
 And you just eat like this bowl of probably top five meals of my life.

1:23:28.180 --> 1:23:29.180
 Right.

1:23:29.180 --> 1:23:31.180
 I mean, it just, that's the simplicity.

1:23:31.180 --> 1:23:32.180
 It's just the best thing.

1:23:32.180 --> 1:23:36.180
 And it was the fact that it's in terracotta and I'd had this amazing day and, you know, all of these things come together.

1:23:36.180 --> 1:23:38.180
 But I still remember that feeling.

1:23:38.180 --> 1:23:49.180
 I think most of us have those like really great sensual memories of food and they're not about necessarily that one fancy over the top restaurant or something.

1:23:49.180 --> 1:23:52.180
 It's really about the cold context of enjoyment.

1:23:52.180 --> 1:23:54.180
 Maybe you can help me with something.

1:23:54.180 --> 1:24:04.180
 So we, I think offline said that we're both introverts a bit, but I certainly find joy in repetition.

1:24:04.180 --> 1:24:09.180
 So I kind of hide away as an introvert and eat the same thing over and over and over again.

1:24:09.180 --> 1:24:15.180
 But at the same time, I had this conversation with Tyler Cohen, who's an economist, but he's also a food critic.

1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:19.180
 He writes these incredible posts about different foods.

1:24:19.180 --> 1:24:25.180
 And we had this conversation about what his last meal would be.

1:24:25.180 --> 1:24:29.180
 If he had to choose like what is the best meal he's ever eaten that he would want to eat.

1:24:29.180 --> 1:24:31.180
 And he had a good answer about it.

1:24:31.180 --> 1:24:42.180
 It had to do with experience, I think, if for him it was a particular Mexican restaurant and it had in Mexico because of the ingredients, because of the experience, because of the work it took to get there and all those kinds of things.

1:24:42.180 --> 1:24:54.180
 But it also made me realize like when I was going home after that conversation that I couldn't answer that question myself like what is the best meal I've ever eaten because I really haven't experienced much.

1:24:54.180 --> 1:25:09.180
 And so it almost was like a challenge to myself like I feel like I should journey out a little bit more in this life and try stuff and to try to see like what is the best meal for me in the world.

1:25:09.180 --> 1:25:13.180
 You know, like both the experience and the taste, right?

1:25:13.180 --> 1:25:23.180
 So I was kind of wondering first, I'd love to ask you like what your last meal would be or what is the greatest meal you've ever eaten, but also and you're still very young.

1:25:23.180 --> 1:25:28.180
 And so the life is there's still more experiences to be had, right?

1:25:28.180 --> 1:25:34.180
 And for me, like how do you go about finding the best meal in the world?

1:25:34.180 --> 1:25:38.180
 Is there a device you could give essentially?

1:25:38.180 --> 1:25:42.180
 There's that sense of anticipation, right?

1:25:42.180 --> 1:25:54.180
 So if it's the best meal, I'd say for you, it would need to be on the heels of something where you'd pushed yourself with a fast or with an athletic event, right?

1:25:54.180 --> 1:25:59.180
 Or something like you would be coming into it with a sense of anticipation because of deprivation.

1:25:59.180 --> 1:26:05.180
 You would be hungry for it in a bigger sense of the word, like hungry for deep nutrition on your soul level and your as well as your belly.

1:26:05.180 --> 1:26:10.180
 So I'd say that you'd have to think about it as a phase of things like multiple things.

1:26:10.180 --> 1:26:14.180
 And then I also think you love meat, you love cheese.

1:26:14.180 --> 1:26:16.180
 You have to have some things that come together, right?

1:26:16.180 --> 1:26:21.180
 Like there's got to be some specific elements of just your favorite flavors in that.

1:26:21.180 --> 1:26:23.180
 But there could be flavors yet to be discovered.

1:26:23.180 --> 1:26:29.180
 That's a whole other thing because I just emotionally and physically feel good on meat,

1:26:29.180 --> 1:26:36.180
 but that doesn't mean like maybe like a rice based dish like sushi or something like that.

1:26:36.180 --> 1:26:40.180
 Or Indian cuisine where it's like sauces and the breads and whatever.

1:26:40.180 --> 1:26:42.180
 You know, I love that stuff too.

1:26:42.180 --> 1:26:49.180
 So we're not talking about like, you know, a meal's an experience that could be like a one night stand,

1:26:49.180 --> 1:26:52.180
 but with a piece of food, right?

1:26:52.180 --> 1:26:57.180
 It could be a totally different than what actually makes you feel good when you eat it every day.

1:26:57.180 --> 1:26:58.180
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:26:58.180 --> 1:27:00.180
 Completely, completely analogous.

1:27:00.180 --> 1:27:01.180
 I get that.

1:27:01.180 --> 1:27:05.180
 I mean, you also though there's elements of comfort and love and those different pieces for you.

1:27:05.180 --> 1:27:09.180
 But I think you got to look at like, where would you go somewhere?

1:27:09.180 --> 1:27:14.180
 Like would you go to a place where you could, you know, hike in Japan and then end up in a little place

1:27:14.180 --> 1:27:15.180
 where you eat something?

1:27:15.180 --> 1:27:16.180
 That's right.

1:27:16.180 --> 1:27:18.180
 That's where I would think you are going to have that magic moment.

1:27:18.180 --> 1:27:23.180
 You know, maybe someplace you go to Mongolia and you're in a really extreme environment for three or four days

1:27:23.180 --> 1:27:28.180
 and then you come back and you're in a farm and you get something on the table that's a surprise and you're hungry.

1:27:28.180 --> 1:27:34.180
 Like that's going to be the moment where you're going to explode in the sense of like the culinary level.

1:27:34.180 --> 1:27:35.180
 Yeah.

1:27:35.180 --> 1:27:36.180
 For a Lex that levels up, right?

1:27:36.180 --> 1:27:37.180
 Yeah.

1:27:37.180 --> 1:27:38.180
 That's the journey for you.

1:27:38.180 --> 1:27:46.180
 It has to be, I think from understanding you, like a combination of that pushing yourself, anticipation and something about the

1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:47.180
 Exactly.

1:27:47.180 --> 1:27:48.180
 And the environment.

1:27:48.180 --> 1:27:53.180
 Well, I definitely, definitely like some fasting is part of a great meal for me.

1:27:53.180 --> 1:27:56.180
 So like 24 hours is like the minimum.

1:27:56.180 --> 1:28:04.180
 You're more sensitive to the richness of any experience for me when I fast 24 hours.

1:28:04.180 --> 1:28:10.180
 Like, and so that's a requirement for a good meal is 24 hour fast, I think.

1:28:10.180 --> 1:28:18.180
 It's just like you're able to taste, I don't know, maybe psychological, but you're able to disassemble the various flavors in a meal

1:28:18.180 --> 1:28:20.180
 as simple as like even a chicken breast.

1:28:20.180 --> 1:28:25.180
 There's all kinds of flavors going on because like when you cook a chicken breast, there's like

1:28:25.180 --> 1:28:26.180
 the outside, the inside.

1:28:26.180 --> 1:28:31.180
 I mean, the volume of the meat tastes different as you eat like the different fibers.

1:28:31.180 --> 1:28:37.180
 And you can like tell all those differences as you're eating when you're fasted and you can appreciate that.

1:28:37.180 --> 1:28:38.180
 And of course, you're right.

1:28:38.180 --> 1:28:40.180
 Part of the journey is important.

1:28:40.180 --> 1:28:45.180
 It makes me think like whether restaurants is the right place to explore or

1:28:45.180 --> 1:28:47.180
 I'm envisioning it on a farm for you.

1:28:47.180 --> 1:28:53.180
 And I'm envisioning it in a place that's like really into ag and food, you know, like, even in a place like Romania.

1:28:53.180 --> 1:28:58.180
 You know, like they have incredible farms, right, where it's not going to get any like fancy restaurants there,

1:28:58.180 --> 1:29:04.180
 but you're probably going to have some amazing little cheeses and cured meats and you might go to some, you know,

1:29:04.180 --> 1:29:08.180
 have some experience and end up in a place with like four things on the plate and each of them blows your mind.

1:29:08.180 --> 1:29:11.180
 You know, like, or Japan is another place like that.

1:29:11.180 --> 1:29:18.180
 I think Vietnam, Laos, like, I mean, those are countries where there's like these incredible niche ingredients and this essentialism around food.

1:29:18.180 --> 1:29:19.180
 That's fascinating.

1:29:19.180 --> 1:29:21.180
 Or maybe it's in Russia with Putin.

1:29:21.180 --> 1:29:23.180
 That might be the best meal in the world.

1:29:23.180 --> 1:29:24.180
 Or with him on the farm too.

1:29:24.180 --> 1:29:25.180
 Yeah.

1:29:25.180 --> 1:29:27.180
 That'd be, it's hard to reproduce that.

1:29:27.180 --> 1:29:34.180
 If that is in fact a good meal, it'd be, you know, it's hard to, it's hard to get them out to the farm, but maybe one time, maybe the best meal.

1:29:34.180 --> 1:29:35.180
 What about you?

1:29:35.180 --> 1:29:46.180
 For me, like it's the, it's the ingredients that I associate with like indulgence, like be fresh bread with like my favorite culture butter on it, be food of my childhood.

1:29:46.180 --> 1:29:47.180
 I grew up in Oregon.

1:29:47.180 --> 1:29:51.180
 We always had salmon and I smoked salmon or salmon eggs, like really good salmon eggs.

1:29:51.180 --> 1:29:52.180
 I love cheese.

1:29:52.180 --> 1:29:53.180
 I love goat cheese.

1:29:53.180 --> 1:29:54.180
 I love all kinds of cheese.

1:29:54.180 --> 1:29:55.180
 There'd be cheese.

1:29:55.180 --> 1:29:56.180
 I love meat, obviously.

1:29:56.180 --> 1:30:00.180
 It's, I'm imagining it's sort of like an abundance of like 10 things I love.

1:30:00.180 --> 1:30:01.180
 It's not a dish.

1:30:01.180 --> 1:30:02.180
 You know, it's like all the yummy things.

1:30:02.180 --> 1:30:04.180
 All of your indulgence is on the same plate.

1:30:04.180 --> 1:30:05.180
 Yeah.

1:30:05.180 --> 1:30:08.180
 And there isn't like, for me, there's not like a big cake or something super like that.

1:30:08.180 --> 1:30:14.180
 It's like really yummy things that I love, like really fresh, crusty, delicious bread that's warm and it's got a bunch of butter on it.

1:30:14.180 --> 1:30:17.180
 And I can put some salt on it and eat a big slab of that.

1:30:17.180 --> 1:30:19.180
 That's just, that's where I'm at.

1:30:19.180 --> 1:30:20.180
 That's funny.

1:30:20.180 --> 1:30:24.180
 And so meat to you is not like one of those indulgences.

1:30:24.180 --> 1:30:25.180
 Oh, definitely.

1:30:25.180 --> 1:30:26.180
 That definitely be steak there too.

1:30:26.180 --> 1:30:28.180
 I'm just imagining not like there isn't a specific dish.

1:30:28.180 --> 1:30:30.180
 It's like eight or 10 things, right?

1:30:30.180 --> 1:30:31.180
 It's the fresh bread.

1:30:31.180 --> 1:30:32.180
 Yeah.

1:30:32.180 --> 1:30:37.180
 It's something like fishy, yummy, probably be really good fresh berries too.

1:30:37.180 --> 1:30:42.180
 There'd be a steak or pork chop or something like meaty and delicious and savory.

1:30:42.180 --> 1:30:49.180
 There'd be some cheese, just a bunch of different things that I love to eat that like all kind of check boxes for me is probably what would make me happiest.

1:30:49.180 --> 1:30:51.180
 I'm afraid of variety.

1:30:51.180 --> 1:30:57.180
 I like the focus when you can just, this is all you have the scarcity of just this is the one ingredient.

1:30:57.180 --> 1:30:58.180
 Yeah.

1:30:58.180 --> 1:31:05.180
 And really appreciating, appreciating it or maybe one thing, like one full complex flavor, whatever the heck that is.

1:31:05.180 --> 1:31:19.180
 It's like the distraction, the serial dating nature of having a bunch of things in a plate is, yeah, for some reason that prevents me from fully enjoying any one of them.

1:31:19.180 --> 1:31:20.180
 I don't know why that is.

1:31:20.180 --> 1:31:23.180
 The more healthy way to do it is the varieties.

1:31:23.180 --> 1:31:25.180
 Your way is the healthier way to do it.

1:31:25.180 --> 1:31:27.180
 Is alcohol involved?

1:31:27.180 --> 1:31:28.180
 I don't drink very much.

1:31:28.180 --> 1:31:29.180
 Okay.

1:31:29.180 --> 1:31:32.180
 I like red wine, but I just don't really.

1:31:32.180 --> 1:31:36.180
 I love, yeah, I love red wine with good food.

1:31:36.180 --> 1:31:40.180
 And I also co founded a rum business.

1:31:40.180 --> 1:31:41.180
 That's an organic rum.

1:31:41.180 --> 1:31:49.180
 So I love that product, but that's not, that for me, it's like I'm more interested in the, in the food, I'd say.

1:31:49.180 --> 1:31:54.180
 Is there some connection between your chef life, cooking and music?

1:31:54.180 --> 1:31:57.180
 Does this music have a role in the experience?

1:31:57.180 --> 1:32:05.180
 Like I love artistic expression and that's a, that's always had a role in my life in the same way I love to paint and draw and all the different things.

1:32:05.180 --> 1:32:14.180
 I was a professional musician when I lived in Sicily by definition technicality because I played in the municipal band.

1:32:14.180 --> 1:32:19.180
 So I would march around the town with all the funerals.

1:32:19.180 --> 1:32:23.180
 I get like 50 euro every time I'd like marching a funeral playing my oboe.

1:32:23.180 --> 1:32:30.180
 So it's given me, I like that because I like to, like you were talking about going to farms, like what I quested for and was experiencing connection, right?

1:32:30.180 --> 1:32:32.180
 In places where I could learn things.

1:32:32.180 --> 1:32:34.180
 That's been the through line of my learning journey.

1:32:34.180 --> 1:32:39.180
 I've learned things and sought knowledge that I can't get in any conventional learning environment.

1:32:39.180 --> 1:32:42.180
 And so what are the tools that let me do that?

1:32:42.180 --> 1:32:48.180
 It was like being adaptable and comfortable in different cultures, but also having common ground points, right?

1:32:48.180 --> 1:32:51.180
 That are, that are, that are, allow you to connect with people.

1:32:51.180 --> 1:32:52.180
 So music is one of those things.

1:32:52.180 --> 1:32:59.180
 So I love like, you know, music, but I also, you know, any, there's any number of enjoy a food, being able to pitch in, help in the kitchen.

1:32:59.180 --> 1:33:04.180
 You know, like cards, like those are when you're dealing with getting into like farming communities and stuff.

1:33:04.180 --> 1:33:06.180
 That stuff really helps, right?

1:33:06.180 --> 1:33:11.180
 So I basically have cultivated tools that let me drop into places where I can learn.

1:33:11.180 --> 1:33:13.180
 And so those are all kind of, of a piece.

1:33:13.180 --> 1:33:15.180
 Those are just tools to get in there.

1:33:15.180 --> 1:33:18.180
 That said, we did listen to Justin Bieber earlier today.

1:33:18.180 --> 1:33:23.180
 That was a, I need to get more into them. I need to, I need to understand the full complexity of the Bebes.

1:33:23.180 --> 1:33:29.180
 You're trying to achieve what hunting stands for, but at a much larger scale, which is what kind of a campus stands for.

1:33:29.180 --> 1:33:32.180
 But what, what are your thoughts on hunting as a source of meat?

1:33:32.180 --> 1:33:35.180
 It's amazing. 100% pro hunting.

1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:45.180
 I think the reason that hunting flips the switch for so many people is because it's the first time they've had clean meat in their lives.

1:33:45.180 --> 1:33:53.180
 Okay. So I think that the hunter's journey, when people get so turned on by hunting, they're just like, Oh my God, I'm never going back.

1:33:53.180 --> 1:33:55.180
 I'm saying that's great.

1:33:55.180 --> 1:33:58.180
 If you've got access to that, or if you know the guy who'll give you the backstrap, awesome.

1:33:58.180 --> 1:34:02.180
 But like you, that's not very, that's not achievable for most of us.

1:34:02.180 --> 1:34:08.180
 And I do think that talking to hunters about their experiences, what they love about it, many of them are just outdoors.

1:34:08.180 --> 1:34:13.180
 And I say that because most of them are men, but most of them love the outdoors aspect of it and being out in, in the wild.

1:34:13.180 --> 1:34:16.180
 But a lot of them, it's because of how they feel when they eat the meat.

1:34:16.180 --> 1:34:21.180
 And it's because they're eating, I mean, 99% of meat in America is made a very specific way.

1:34:21.180 --> 1:34:26.180
 And it's in a way that is pretty inflammatory, not incredibly delicious.

1:34:26.180 --> 1:34:35.180
 And when you're on that extreme, and then you toggle to having this totally different style of product, it feels radically different in your body.

1:34:35.180 --> 1:34:37.180
 So of course, you're like, I'll never go back.

1:34:37.180 --> 1:34:42.180
 So when I talk about us being on that spectrum, it's like, well, it's hunted meats.

1:34:42.180 --> 1:34:53.180
 I mean, I can never on any commercial operation create the variety of the biodiversity of species that an elk gets when it's wandering around of his owner.

1:34:53.180 --> 1:34:55.180
 I mean, I can, there's no way you can do that on a farm.

1:34:55.180 --> 1:35:02.180
 So there's always going to be that extra five or 10% that those wild animals are going to have, you know, and those wild animals also fast for longer.

1:35:02.180 --> 1:35:07.180
 So they go through periods of starvation and that creates an even like slower growth for musculature.

1:35:07.180 --> 1:35:12.180
 That's going to be create even more unique flavor and characteristics.

1:35:12.180 --> 1:35:15.180
 And so that's why there's that that extra in the hunted meat.

1:35:15.180 --> 1:35:23.180
 But you can come a lot closer with regenerative traditional farming to that flavor and health than with any other type of farming.

1:35:23.180 --> 1:35:25.180
 I know. So that's where I see it on the spectrum.

1:35:25.180 --> 1:35:33.180
 I love that people are getting excited about about game because it's all it's better for your health.

1:35:33.180 --> 1:35:40.180
 It's got all the same characteristics as regenerative farm meat and it gets people turned on to like simple, delicious food.

1:35:40.180 --> 1:35:50.180
 You know, you shouldn't have to cover food with sauce that's got corn syrup and soy, a bunch of junk in it to make it palatable.

1:35:50.180 --> 1:35:54.180
 If you got to put sauce on your food, you need to look at your ingredients.

1:35:54.180 --> 1:36:02.180
 You need to revisit what you're starting from because if you have to put a bunch of things to mask flavor onto anything you're eating,

1:36:02.180 --> 1:36:06.180
 you're trying to basically fool your palate into doing what's not best for your body.

1:36:06.180 --> 1:36:11.180
 We're trying to tell our palates like just make it through this plate so you can get the calories in.

1:36:11.180 --> 1:36:15.180
 And we're masking the fact that we don't actually find it very appetizing.

1:36:15.180 --> 1:36:20.180
 So we're kind of teaching ourselves to overcome our instinct with food.

1:36:20.180 --> 1:36:25.180
 We're saying here's this kind of bland base substrate, not very interesting.

1:36:25.180 --> 1:36:27.180
 I'm not like sparking to it.

1:36:27.180 --> 1:36:29.180
 Awesome. Put sugar and salt on it.

1:36:29.180 --> 1:36:32.180
 This up the hyper process flavor profile. Great. Done.

1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:34.180
 And then your spark to it.

1:36:34.180 --> 1:36:36.180
 That's not that's a very short road.

1:36:36.180 --> 1:36:46.180
 And that's I think a lot of the health problems we have now is because we're masking flavors and basically trying to get ourselves to move down this path of the same way we behave around all hyper process foods.

1:36:46.180 --> 1:36:49.180
 And that gets us into a mess with our health.

1:36:49.180 --> 1:36:57.180
 So if we can get things like game where people love the flavor out of the gate, but it's natural, simple, mental and process, like that's a win.

1:36:57.180 --> 1:37:03.180
 It reverses that hyper processing trend that we're on as a human species.

1:37:03.180 --> 1:37:08.180
 And that's the promise of regenerative farming. That's the promise of hunting.

1:37:08.180 --> 1:37:14.180
 Obviously, the former can be scaled. The hunting, I think, cannot be scaled, right?

1:37:14.180 --> 1:37:19.180
 But in many ways, the hunting inspires the world that this is the right way to eat.

1:37:19.180 --> 1:37:20.180
 Yes.

1:37:20.180 --> 1:37:31.180
 And that naturally leads to then the humane farming, regenerative farming idea, which is this idea that hunting represents.

1:37:31.180 --> 1:37:33.180
 How do you scale that?

1:37:33.180 --> 1:37:39.180
 Well, if you look at like, you know, we're talking about people use the sort of marketing language of like happy cows or that kind of thing.

1:37:39.180 --> 1:37:42.180
 You know, if you're talking about the happiest animals, it's wild animals, right?

1:37:42.180 --> 1:37:46.180
 So if you wonder why these practices are good, talk to hunters.

1:37:46.180 --> 1:37:50.180
 You know, you're talking about animals that have lived in their evolutionary capacity, right?

1:37:50.180 --> 1:37:54.180
 Who have played their role in the ecosystem, who've lived their meaning of life, right?

1:37:54.180 --> 1:38:00.180
 And that's a very powerfully different kind of role than livestock production.

1:38:00.180 --> 1:38:07.180
 So I think if we can make our livestock production as similar to wild as possible, then we're a lot of steps closer.

1:38:07.180 --> 1:38:12.180
 So you said the animals are happiest in the wild and that's where they find meaning.

1:38:12.180 --> 1:38:17.180
 What about us, the human animal, what's the meaning for us, do you think?

1:38:17.180 --> 1:38:21.180
 You've monitored the life cycle of a lot of living beings.

1:38:21.180 --> 1:38:26.180
 You ever look in the mirror and think like, why the hell are we humans here?

1:38:26.180 --> 1:38:32.180
 I mean, thriving, reducing suffering, creating goodness.

1:38:32.180 --> 1:38:36.180
 I mean, those are the things I see in animals behavior.

1:38:36.180 --> 1:38:43.180
 They're mostly interested in reducing suffering and nurturing, right?

1:38:43.180 --> 1:38:45.180
 Those are the things that I think evolutionarily.

1:38:45.180 --> 1:38:47.180
 And we humans are just clever.

1:38:47.180 --> 1:38:50.180
 We want to be able to try to do that at a bigger and bigger scale,

1:38:50.180 --> 1:38:55.180
 like as much as possible reduce the suffering in the world.

1:38:55.180 --> 1:38:58.180
 And somehow that alleviates us of our own suffering.

1:38:58.180 --> 1:39:05.180
 That's the Russian thing, life is suffering and somehow helping others alleviates it

1:39:05.180 --> 1:39:07.180
 and come up with creative solutions to do that.

1:39:07.180 --> 1:39:11.180
 That's really interesting.

1:39:11.180 --> 1:39:16.180
 It's almost consciousness is the thing that led to suffering,

1:39:16.180 --> 1:39:20.180
 but it also led to the desire to alleviate the suffering.

1:39:20.180 --> 1:39:23.180
 It's a feedback loop.

1:39:23.180 --> 1:39:27.180
 Consciousness creates suffering and the desire to alleviate it.

1:39:27.180 --> 1:39:30.180
 Is there yet a pretty nonlinear life?

1:39:30.180 --> 1:39:36.180
 Your parents or professors, you have done a lot of incredible things

1:39:36.180 --> 1:39:40.180
 that many would say kind of like, how the hell are you going to get this done?

1:39:40.180 --> 1:39:46.180
 Is there advice you can give to young people today, like high school, college,

1:39:46.180 --> 1:39:51.180
 about how to live a similarly nonlinear, crazy life

1:39:51.180 --> 1:39:54.180
 and accomplish be as successful as you have been,

1:39:54.180 --> 1:39:59.180
 about whether it's just their career or life in general?

1:39:59.180 --> 1:40:10.180
 The greatest gifts I've been given have come from pursuing curiosity.

1:40:10.180 --> 1:40:13.180
 Just trying to understand the thing you're curious about

1:40:13.180 --> 1:40:16.180
 and allowing yourself to be curious about it and just going with it.

1:40:16.180 --> 1:40:23.180
 And also pursuing things that are like deeply joyful for me.

1:40:23.180 --> 1:40:27.180
 Not with society once, but you just personally, just on your own, you're happy that you did it.

1:40:27.180 --> 1:40:33.180
 And that's something that in the times when I strayed from that, my life has been harder.

1:40:33.180 --> 1:40:39.180
 So it's fundamentally what are we on earth to do, to live and thrive.

1:40:39.180 --> 1:40:48.180
 And so pursuing things that are curious and satisfying and interesting and joyful

1:40:48.180 --> 1:40:51.180
 and allow me to grow.

1:40:51.180 --> 1:40:58.180
 I made a number of choices to do things that were more complicated

1:40:58.180 --> 1:41:03.180
 and kind of not considered like so cool at the time,

1:41:03.180 --> 1:41:05.180
 although now it's cool to work on farms.

1:41:05.180 --> 1:41:08.180
 It wasn't when I started my career in animal agriculture.

1:41:08.180 --> 1:41:11.180
 And it was like, but just deeply interesting to me.

1:41:11.180 --> 1:41:14.180
 And I felt like there was just lots to learn.

1:41:14.180 --> 1:41:19.180
 And so that's been the path for me is like going for something that's curious and hard

1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:22.180
 and kind of sticking with it and being open to it

1:41:22.180 --> 1:41:29.180
 and growing elements that give me joy through that.

1:41:29.180 --> 1:41:33.180
 So I also, you know, for people who are starting out in their careers

1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:37.180
 and want to do something different too, it's like, get out of your comfort.

1:41:37.180 --> 1:41:40.180
 Go to a place that you've got something to learn from and let it teach you that

1:41:40.180 --> 1:41:42.180
 and you'll, you'll get beat up.

1:41:42.180 --> 1:41:44.180
 Like I got beat up by that experience.

1:41:44.180 --> 1:41:45.180
 Like it was really hard.

1:41:45.180 --> 1:41:50.180
 You know, I laugh about now working for insistently for, excuse me.

1:41:50.180 --> 1:41:53.180
 I mean, like, and the funny experiences I had there, but it was hard.

1:41:53.180 --> 1:41:55.180
 I was lonely and cried a lot.

1:41:55.180 --> 1:41:56.180
 It was stressful.

1:41:56.180 --> 1:41:57.180
 It was like, it was hard.

1:41:57.180 --> 1:41:58.180
 It was really hard.

1:41:58.180 --> 1:42:00.180
 When you inside of it, you didn't know how it's going to turn out.

1:42:00.180 --> 1:42:01.180
 You didn't know it's going to turn out well.

1:42:01.180 --> 1:42:04.180
 And I'm like, why didn't I get a job doing something that all my friends are doing

1:42:04.180 --> 1:42:06.180
 and, and, and I didn't speak the language.

1:42:06.180 --> 1:42:09.180
 I had to learn foreign language and learn how to function.

1:42:09.180 --> 1:42:12.180
 And it like, it was very lonely and very challenging.

1:42:12.180 --> 1:42:15.180
 And then that's where my resilience started to grow.

1:42:15.180 --> 1:42:16.180
 Right.

1:42:16.180 --> 1:42:20.180
 So the things I learned there ended up just being about resilience and

1:42:20.180 --> 1:42:23.180
 understanding the language of subtlety and meaning.

1:42:23.180 --> 1:42:25.180
 So that's something that's carried me through my life.

1:42:25.180 --> 1:42:29.180
 But it was a curiosity about cheesemaking and about like just living in a village

1:42:29.180 --> 1:42:30.180
 that was there.

1:42:30.180 --> 1:42:32.180
 I'm like, wouldn't it be amazing to just live in a really rural village.

1:42:32.180 --> 1:42:33.180
 And you just went with it.

1:42:33.180 --> 1:42:37.180
 And I just like, this seems incredible and, and have a place where you can, you know,

1:42:37.180 --> 1:42:42.180
 like the people seem interesting, the food seems good and let's just like try this

1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:43.180
 and see what I can learn.

1:42:43.180 --> 1:42:48.180
 And that like putting yourself out of your comfort zone in a place where you have a chance

1:42:48.180 --> 1:42:54.180
 to learn and grow is, is the secret because it's, you grow through discomfort.

1:42:54.180 --> 1:42:58.180
 You know, people think that you grow when you get into this environment where everything's

1:42:58.180 --> 1:43:03.180
 like kind of sailing along, but like growth actually comes through pain.

1:43:03.180 --> 1:43:08.180
 You know, it's like growth comes from being cut down and beat down and having to re,

1:43:08.180 --> 1:43:10.180
 regrow and double down.

1:43:10.180 --> 1:43:14.180
 And so that kind of, that kind of opportunity, you have to seek it out.

1:43:14.180 --> 1:43:16.180
 You have to put yourself in the line of fire a bit.

1:43:16.180 --> 1:43:21.180
 If the situation sucks, it's a sign that you might be doing something right in the

1:43:21.180 --> 1:43:26.180
 sense that you're on the path at the end of which you'll be a better person.

1:43:26.180 --> 1:43:30.180
 If you allow yourself to grow in that way, like as opposed to resisting it, just going

1:43:30.180 --> 1:43:33.180
 along with a journey and persevering.

1:43:33.180 --> 1:43:37.180
 And that ended us up in this incredible place.

1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:40.180
 This whole conversation, I'll probably overlay a video.

1:43:40.180 --> 1:43:45.180
 I'm looking at a gorgeous mountain and it's an incredible farm.

1:43:45.180 --> 1:43:47.180
 Thank you so much for a meal yesterday.

1:43:47.180 --> 1:43:49.180
 That was incredible.

1:43:49.180 --> 1:43:53.180
 The cheese, the fish eggs, just everything about this place.

1:43:53.180 --> 1:43:56.180
 Looking up, you can see the stars.

1:43:56.180 --> 1:43:59.180
 The stars at night are beautiful and there's a peacefulness to it.

1:43:59.180 --> 1:44:05.180
 I had a pretty hard week actually, just emotionally in many ways.

1:44:05.180 --> 1:44:08.180
 And just coming here, it's immediately so much of it is lifted.

1:44:08.180 --> 1:44:13.180
 So I really deeply appreciate Anya that you would invite me here and that you

1:44:13.180 --> 1:44:14.180
 have this conversation.

1:44:14.180 --> 1:44:16.180
 This was, this was really awesome.

1:44:16.180 --> 1:44:17.180
 So thank you so much.

1:44:17.180 --> 1:44:18.180
 Thank you.

1:44:19.180 --> 1:44:22.180
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Anya Fernald.

1:44:22.180 --> 1:44:28.180
 And thank you to Gala Games, Athletic Greens, ForSigmatic and Fundrise.

1:44:28.180 --> 1:44:31.180
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

1:44:31.180 --> 1:44:36.180
 And now, let me leave you some words from the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu.

1:44:36.180 --> 1:44:38.180
 Nature does not hurry.

1:44:38.180 --> 1:44:41.180
 Yet, everything is accomplished.

1:44:41.180 --> 1:44:43.180
 Thank you for listening.

1:44:43.180 --> 1:44:59.180
 I hope to see you next time.
