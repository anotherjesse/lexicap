 The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram, his second time in the podcast.

00:05.040 --> 00:12.000
 He's a computer scientist, mathematician, theoretical physicist, and the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research,

00:12.480 --> 00:18.640
 a company behind Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language, and the new Wolfram Physics Project.

00:19.240 --> 00:27.520
 He's the author of several books, including A New Kind of Science and the new book, A Project to Find the Fundamental Theory of Physics.

00:27.520 --> 00:37.320
 This second round of our conversation is primarily focused on this latter endeavor of searching for the physics of our universe in simple rules that do their work on

00:37.320 --> 00:44.840
 hypergraphs and eventually generate the infrastructure from which space, time, and all of modern physics can emerge.

00:55.840 --> 01:04.120
 As a side note, let me say that to me, the idea that seemingly infinite complexity can arise from very simple rules and initial

01:04.120 --> 01:10.200
 conditions is one of the most beautiful and important mathematical and philosophical mysteries in science.

01:10.400 --> 01:19.440
 I find that both cellular automata and the hypergraph data structure that Stephen and team are currently working on to be the kind of simple, clear

01:19.440 --> 01:28.960
 mathematical playground within which fundamental ideas about intelligence, consciousness, and the fundamental laws of physics can be further

01:28.960 --> 01:37.960
 developed in totally new ways. In fact, I think I'll try to make a video or two about the most beautiful aspects of these models in the coming

01:37.960 --> 01:47.640
 weeks, especially I think trying to describe how fellow curious minds like myself can jump in and explore them either just for fun or

01:47.640 --> 01:54.040
 potentially for publication of new innovative research in math, computer science, and physics.

01:54.040 --> 02:01.760
 But honestly, I think the emerging complexity in these hypergraphs can capture the imagination of everyone, even if you're someone who never really

02:01.760 --> 02:10.920
 connected with mathematics. That's my hope, at least to have these conversations that inspire everyone to look up to the skies and into our own

02:10.920 --> 02:21.160
 minds in awe of our amazing universe. Let me also mention that this is the first time I ever recorded a podcast outdoors as a kind of

02:21.160 --> 02:30.520
 experiment to see if this is an option in times of COVID. I'm sorry if the audio is not great. I did my best and promise to keep improving

02:30.520 --> 02:38.280

03:43.760 --> 03:55.640
 seen the movie, he's a hitman with a minimalist life that resembles my own. In fact, when I was younger, the idea of being a hitman or targeting evil in a

03:55.640 --> 04:04.480
 skilled way, which is how I thought about it, really appealed to me. The skill of it, the planning, the craftsmanship. In another life,

04:04.480 --> 04:12.640
 perhaps if I didn't love engineering and science so much, I could see myself being something like a Navy SEAL. And in general, I love the idea of

04:12.640 --> 04:22.240
 serving my country, of serving society by contributing my skill in some small way. Anyway, go to SimplySafe.com to get a free HD

04:59.560 --> 05:07.360
 Maybe on a personal note, one of my favorite things to do is watch people cook, especially people who love cooking, and hang out with people over

05:07.360 --> 05:15.200
 amazing meals. I still tend to be strict in my diet, no matter what, even in fancy restaurants. But it brings me joy to see friends and

05:15.200 --> 05:24.880
 family indulge something like a cake that has way too many calories or ice cream or whatever. My mom, in fact, for much of my life,

05:24.880 --> 05:33.840
 made this cake called an anthill on my birthday that brings me a lot of joy and way too many calories. I was thinking of doing a video with

05:33.840 --> 05:45.840
 my mom as she makes it. I thought it'd be a fun thing to do together. Anyway, go to somebasket.com slash LEX and use code LEX. Do it now. So they sign a

06:14.680 --> 06:23.200
 intellectual risks. I'm thinking of doing a few solo podcast episodes on difficult topics, especially in history, like the rise and fall of the

06:23.200 --> 06:34.360
 Reich or Stalin, Putin, and many other difficult topics that I'm fascinated by. I have a worldview that seeks inspiring positive insights, even and perhaps

06:34.360 --> 06:44.560
 especially from periods of tragedy and evil that perhaps some folks may find value in. If I can only learn to convey the ideas in my mind as clearly as I

06:44.560 --> 06:57.040
 think them, I think deeply and rigorously and precisely. But to be honest, have trouble speaking in a way that reflects that rigor of thought. So it really

06:57.040 --> 07:05.920
 doesn't mean a lot. The love and support I get as I try to get better at this thing, at this talking thing. Anyway, go to masterclass.com slash

07:16.000 --> 07:25.920
 history of physics, and maybe mathematical physics or even mathematics where breakthroughs happen, and then a flurry of progress follows. So if you look back

07:25.920 --> 07:35.520
 through the history of physics, what moments stand out to you as important such breakthroughs where flurry of progress follows? So the big famous

07:35.520 --> 07:44.320
 one was 1920s, the invention of quantum mechanics, where, you know, in about five or 10 years, lots of stuff got figured out. That's now quantum

07:44.320 --> 07:52.800
 mechanics. Can you mention the people involved? Yeah, it was kind of the Schrodinger, Heisenberg, you know, Einstein had been a key figure originally

07:52.800 --> 08:03.120
 Plank, then Dirac was a little bit later. That was something that happened at that time. That's sort of before my time, right? In my time was in the 1970s.

08:03.120 --> 08:13.360
 There was this sort of realization that quantum field theory was actually going to be useful in physics. And QCD quantum carbon dynamics theory of quarks

08:13.360 --> 08:21.920
 and gluons and so on, was really getting started. And there was again, sort of big flurry of things happened then I happened to be a teenager at that

08:21.920 --> 08:29.520
 time and happened to be really involved in physics. And so I got to be part of that, which was really cool.

08:29.520 --> 08:39.360
 Who were the key figures, aside from your young selves at that time? You know, who won the Nobel Prize for QCD? Okay, people, David Gross, Frank Wilczak,

08:39.360 --> 08:49.280
 you know, David Pollitzer, the people who are the sort of the slightly older generation, Dick Feynman, Murray Gellman, people like that, who were Steve

08:49.280 --> 08:59.120
 Weinberg, Gadot Hoft, he's younger. He's in the younger group, actually. But these are all, you know, characters who were involved.

08:59.120 --> 09:10.080
 I mean, it was, you know, it's funny, because those are all people who are kind of in my time, and I know them, and they don't seem like sort of historical, you know, iconic figures.

09:10.080 --> 09:22.880
 They seem more like everyday characters, so to speak. And so it's always, you know, when you look at history from long afterwards, it always seems like everything happened instantly.

09:22.880 --> 09:33.120
 And that's usually not the case. There was usually a long build up. But usually there's, you know, there's some methodological thing happens. And then there's a whole bunch of low hanging fruit to be picked.

09:33.120 --> 09:47.920
 And that usually lasts five or 10 years. You know, we see it today with machine learning and, you know, deep learning neural nets and so on, you know, methodological advance, things actually started working in, you know, 2011, 2012 and so on.

09:47.920 --> 09:59.920
 And, you know, there's been this sort of rapid picking of low hanging fruit, which is probably, you know, some significant fraction of the way done, so to speak.

09:59.920 --> 10:07.920
 Do you think there's a key moment? Like, if I had to really introspect, like, what was the key moment for the deep learning, quote unquote, revolution?

10:07.920 --> 10:09.920
 It's probably the AlexNet business.

10:09.920 --> 10:19.920
 AlexNet with ImageNet. So is there something like that with physics where, so deep learning neural networks have been around for a long time?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.920
 Absolutely, it's the 1940s.

10:21.920 --> 10:29.920
 There's a bunch of little pieces that came together, and then all of a sudden everybody's eyes lit up, like, wow, there's something here.

10:29.920 --> 10:39.920
 Like, even just looking at your own work, just your thinking about the universe, that there's simple rules can create complexity.

10:39.920 --> 10:49.920
 You know, at which point was there a thing where your eyes light up? It's like, wait a minute, there's something here. Is it the very first idea?

10:49.920 --> 10:54.920
 Or is it some moment along the line of implementations and experiments and so on?

10:54.920 --> 11:00.920
 There's a couple of different stages to this. I mean, one is the think about the world computationally.

11:00.920 --> 11:05.920
 You know, can we use programs instead of equations to make models of the world?

11:05.920 --> 11:09.920
 That's something that I got interested in at the beginning of the 1980s.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.920
 You know, I did a bunch of computer experiments.

11:12.920 --> 11:19.920
 You know, when I first did them, I didn't really, I could see some significance to them, but took me a few years to really say,

11:19.920 --> 11:26.920
 wow, there's a big important phenomenon here that lets sort of complex things arise from very simple programs.

11:26.920 --> 11:32.920
 That kind of happened back in 1984 or so. Then, you know, a bunch of other years go by.

11:32.920 --> 11:38.920
 Then I start actually doing a lot of much more systematic computer experiments and things and find out that the,

11:38.920 --> 11:44.920
 you know, this phenomenon that I could only have said occurs in one particular case is actually something incredibly general.

11:44.920 --> 11:50.920
 And then that led me to this thing called Principled Computational Equivalence, and that was a long story.

11:50.920 --> 11:58.920
 And then, you know, as part of that process, I was like, OK, you can make simple programs, can make models of complicated things.

11:58.920 --> 12:03.920
 What about the whole universe? That's our sort of ultimate example of a complicated thing.

12:03.920 --> 12:09.920
 And so I got to thinking, you know, could we use these ideas to study fundamental physics?

12:09.920 --> 12:13.920
 You know, I happen to know a lot about, you know, traditional fundamental physics.

12:13.920 --> 12:18.920
 My first, you know, I had a bunch of ideas about how to do this in the early 1990s.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.920
 I made a bunch of technical progress. I figured out a bunch of things I thought were pretty interesting.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.920
 You know, I wrote about them back in 2002.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.920
 With the new kind of science and the cellular autometer world.

12:28.920 --> 12:29.920
 Right.

12:29.920 --> 12:35.920
 And there's echoes in the cellular autometer world with your new Wolfram physics project world.

12:35.920 --> 12:41.920
 We'll get to all that. Allow me to sort of romanticize a little more on the philosophy of science.

12:41.920 --> 12:51.920
 So Thomas Kuhn, a philosopher of science, describes that, you know, the progress in science is made with these paradigm shifts.

12:51.920 --> 13:02.920
 And so to link on the original line of discussion, do you agree with this view that there is revolutions in science that just kind of flip the table?

13:02.920 --> 13:06.920
 What happens is it's a different way of thinking about things.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.920
 It's a different methodology for studying things. And that opens stuff up.

13:10.920 --> 13:21.920
 This is this idea of, he's a famous biographer, but I think it's called the innovators, the biographer Steve Jobs of Albert Einstein.

13:21.920 --> 13:32.920
 He also wrote a book, I think it's called the innovators where he discusses how a lot of the innovations in the history of computing has been done by groups.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.920
 There's a complicated group dynamic going on.

13:36.920 --> 13:41.920
 But there's also a romanticized notion that the individual is at the core of the revolution.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.920
 Like where does your sense fall?

13:44.920 --> 13:53.920
 Is ultimately like one person responsible for these revolutions that creates the spark or one or two, whatever.

13:53.920 --> 14:00.920
 But or is it just the big mush and mess and chaos of people interacting or personalities interacting?

14:00.920 --> 14:02.920
 I think it ends up being like many things.

14:02.920 --> 14:10.920
 There's leadership and there ends up being it's a lot easier for one person to have a crisp new idea than it is for a big committee to have a crisp new idea.

14:10.920 --> 14:18.920
 But I think it can happen that you have a great idea, but the world isn't ready for it.

14:18.920 --> 14:23.920
 And this has happened to me plenty.

14:23.920 --> 14:28.920
 You have an idea, it's actually a pretty good idea, but things aren't ready.

14:28.920 --> 14:33.920
 Either you're not really ready for it or the ambient world isn't ready for it.

14:33.920 --> 14:37.920
 And it's hard to get the thing to get traction.

14:37.920 --> 14:38.920
 It's kind of interesting.

14:38.920 --> 14:46.920
 I mean, when I look at a new kind of science, you're now living inside the history so you can't tell the story of these decades.

14:46.920 --> 14:58.920
 It seems like the new kind of science has not had the revolutionary impact. I would think it might.

14:58.920 --> 15:08.920
 It feels like at some point, of course it might be, but it feels at some point people will return to that book and say that was something special here.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.920
 This was incredible.

15:10.920 --> 15:11.920
 What happened?

15:11.920 --> 15:12.920
 Or do you think that's already happened?

15:12.920 --> 15:18.920
 Oh, yeah, it's happened, except that people aren't, you know, the sort of the heroism of it may not be there.

15:18.920 --> 15:28.920
 But what's happened is for 300 years, people basically said, if you want to make a model of things in the world, mathematical equations are the best place to go.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.920
 Last 15 years doesn't happen.

15:31.920 --> 15:37.920
 New models that get made of things most often are made with programs, not with equations.

15:37.920 --> 15:46.920
 Now, you know, was that sort of going to happen anyway? Was that a consequence of, you know, my particular work and my particular book?

15:46.920 --> 15:47.920
 It's hard to know for sure.

15:47.920 --> 15:57.920
 I mean, I am always amazed at the amount of feedback that I get from people where they say, oh, by the way, you know, I started doing this whole line of research because I read your book, blah, blah, blah, blah.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.920
 It's like, well, can you tell that from the academic literature?

16:00.920 --> 16:03.920
 You know, was there a chain of, you know, academic references?

16:03.920 --> 16:04.920
 Probably not.

16:04.920 --> 16:18.920
 One of the interesting side effects of publishing in the way you did this tome is it serves as an education tool and an inspiration to hundreds of thousands of millions of people.

16:18.920 --> 16:24.920
 But because it's not a single, it's not a chain of papers with piffy titles.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.920
 It doesn't create a splash of citations.

16:27.920 --> 16:44.920
 It's had plenty of citations, but it's, you know, I think that the people think of it as probably more, you know, conceptual inspiration than kind of a, you know, this is a line from here to here to here in our particular field.

16:44.920 --> 16:59.920
 I think that the, you know, the thing which I am disappointed by and which will eventually happen is this kind of study of the, the sort of pure computationalism, this kind of study of the abstract behavior of the computational universe.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.920
 That should be a big thing that lots of people do.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.920
 You mean in mathematics purely, almost like?

17:05.920 --> 17:08.920
 It's like pure mathematics, but it isn't mathematics.

17:08.920 --> 17:09.920
 But it isn't.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.920
 It isn't.

17:10.920 --> 17:11.920
 It's a new kind of mathematics.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.920
 It's a new kind of mathematics.

17:13.920 --> 17:14.920
 Yeah, right.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.920
 That's why the book is called that.

17:16.920 --> 17:17.920
 Right.

17:17.920 --> 17:18.920
 That's not coincidental.

17:18.920 --> 17:19.920
 Yeah.

17:19.920 --> 17:26.920
 It's interesting that I haven't seen really rigorous investigation by thousands of people of this idea.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.920
 I mean, you look at your competition around rule 30.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.920
 I mean, that's fascinating.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.920
 If you, if you can say something.

17:33.920 --> 17:34.920
 Right.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.920
 Is there some aspect of this thing that could be predicted?

17:37.920 --> 17:40.920
 That's the fundamental question of science.

17:40.920 --> 17:41.920
 That's the core.

17:41.920 --> 17:42.920
 Well, that has been a question of science.

17:42.920 --> 17:46.920
 I think that's a, that is a, some people's view of what science is about.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.920
 And it's not clear that's the right view.

17:48.920 --> 17:57.920
 In fact, as we, as we live through this pandemic full of predictions and so on, it's an interesting moment to be pondering what, what science is actual role in those kinds of things is.

17:57.920 --> 18:06.920
 Oh, you think it's possible that in science, clean, beautiful, simple prediction may not even be possible in real systems.

18:06.920 --> 18:07.920
 That's the open question.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.920
 Right.

18:08.920 --> 18:09.920
 I don't think it's open.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.920
 I think that question is answered and the answer is no.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.920
 I mean, no, no, the answer could be just humans are not smart enough yet.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.920
 We don't have the tools yet.

18:17.920 --> 18:18.920
 No, that's, that's the whole point.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.920
 I mean, that's, that's sort of the big discovery of this principle of computational equivalence of mine.

18:22.920 --> 18:35.920
 And the, you know, this is something which is kind of a follow on to Goethe's theorem to Turing's work on the halting problem, all these kinds of things that there is this fundamental limitation built into science.

18:35.920 --> 18:50.920
 This idea of computational irreducibility that says that, you know, even though you may know the rules by which something operates, that does not mean that you can readily sort of be smarter than it and jump ahead and figure out what it's going to do.

18:50.920 --> 18:51.920
 Yes.

18:51.920 --> 18:59.920
 But do you think there's a hope for pockets of computational reducibility, computational reducibility?

18:59.920 --> 19:00.920
 Yes.

19:00.920 --> 19:05.920
 And then a set of tools and mathematics that help you discover such pockets.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.920
 That's where we live is in the pockets of reducibility.

19:08.920 --> 19:09.920
 Right.

19:09.920 --> 19:25.920
 That's why, you know, and this is one of the things that sort of come out of this physics project and actually something that, again, I should have realized many years ago, but didn't, is, you know, the, it could very well be that everything about the world is computationally reducible and completely unpredictable.

19:25.920 --> 19:31.920
 But, you know, in our experience of the world, there is at least some amount of prediction we can make.

19:31.920 --> 19:37.920
 And that's because we have sort of chosen a slice of probably talk about this in much more detail.

19:37.920 --> 19:45.920
 But I mean, we've kind of chosen a slice of how to think about the universe in which we can kind of sample a certain amount of computational reducibility.

19:45.920 --> 19:59.920
 And that's that's sort of where we where we exist. And it may not be the whole story of how the universe is, but it is the part of the universe that we care about, and we sort of operate in.

19:59.920 --> 20:14.920
 And that's, you know, in science, that's been sort of a very special case of that, that is science has chosen to talk a lot about places where there is this computational reducibility that it can find, you know, the motion of the planets can be more or less predicted.

20:14.920 --> 20:23.920
 You know, the something about the weather is much harder to predict something about, you know, other kinds of things that the are much harder to predict.

20:23.920 --> 20:33.920
 And it's some, these are but science has tended to, you know, concentrate itself on places where its methods have allowed successful prediction.

20:33.920 --> 20:43.920
 So you think rule 30, if we could linger on it, because it's just such a beautiful, simple formulation of the central concept underlying all the things we're talking about.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.920
 Do you think there's pockets of reducibility inside rule 30?

20:47.920 --> 20:55.920
 Yes. But it's a question of how big are they? What will they allow you to say, and so on. And that's, and figuring out where those pockets are.

20:55.920 --> 21:04.920
 I mean, in a sense, that's the that sort of a, you know, that is an essential thing that one would like to do in science.

21:04.920 --> 21:16.920
 But it's also the important thing to realize that has not been, you know, is that science, if you just pick an arbitrary thing, you say, what's the answer to this question?

21:16.920 --> 21:21.920
 That question may not be one that has a computationally reducible answer.

21:21.920 --> 21:31.920
 That question, if you, if you choose, you know, if you walk along the series of questions and you've got one that's reducible and you get to another one that's nearby and it's reducible too.

21:31.920 --> 21:40.920
 If you stick to that kind of stick to the land, so to speak, then you can go down this chain of sort of reducible, answerable things.

21:40.920 --> 21:46.920
 But if you just say, I'm just pick a question at random, I'm going to have my computer pick a question at random.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.920
 Most likely it's going to be reducible.

21:48.920 --> 21:59.920
 Most likely it will be irreducible. And what we're throwing in the world, so to speak, we, you know, when we engineer things, we tend to engineer things to sort of keep in the zone of reducibility.

21:59.920 --> 22:07.920
 When we're throwing things by the natural world, for example, not, not at all certain that we will be kept in this kind of zone of reducibility.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.920
 Can we talk about this pandemic then?

22:10.920 --> 22:11.920
 Sure.

22:11.920 --> 22:12.920
 For a second.

22:12.920 --> 22:18.920
 So how do we, there's obviously a huge amount of economic pain that people are feeling.

22:18.920 --> 22:25.920
 There's a huge incentive and medical pain, health, just all psychological.

22:25.920 --> 22:33.920
 There's a huge incentive to figure this out, to walk along the trajectory of reducible, of reducibility.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.920
 There's, there's a lot of disparate data.

22:37.920 --> 22:44.920
 You know, people understand generally how virus is spread, but it's very complicated because there's a lot of uncertainty.

22:44.920 --> 22:57.920
 There's a, there could be a lot of variability also, like so many, obviously a nearly infinite number of variables that, that represent human interaction.

22:57.920 --> 23:09.920
 And so you have to figure out, from the perspective of reducibility, figure out which variables are really important in this kind of, from an epidemiological perspective.

23:09.920 --> 23:14.920
 So why aren't we, you kind of said that we're clearly failing.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.920
 Well, I think it's a complicated thing.

23:16.920 --> 23:23.920
 So, so I mean, you know, when this pandemic started up, you know, I happened to be in the middle of being about to release this whole physics project thing.

23:23.920 --> 23:24.920
 Yes.

23:24.920 --> 23:25.920
 But I thought, you know,

23:25.920 --> 23:27.920
 The timing is just cosmically absurd.

23:27.920 --> 23:28.920
 A little bit bizarre.

23:28.920 --> 23:38.920
 But, but, but, you know, but I thought, you know, I should do the public service thing of, you know, trying to understand what I could about the pandemic and, you know, we've been curating data about and all that kind of thing.

23:38.920 --> 23:45.920
 But, you know, so I started looking at the data and started looking at modeling and I decided it's just really hard.

23:45.920 --> 23:49.920
 You need to know a lot of stuff that we don't know about human interactions.

23:49.920 --> 23:55.920
 It's actually clear now that there's a lot of stuff we didn't know about viruses and about the way immunity works and so on.

23:55.920 --> 24:05.920
 And it's, you know, I think what will come out in the end is there's a certain amount of what happens that we just kind of have to trace each step and see what happens.

24:05.920 --> 24:11.920
 There's a certain amount of stuff where there's going to be a big narrative about this happened because, you know, of T cell immunity.

24:11.920 --> 24:17.920
 This has happened because there's this whole giant sort of field of asymptomatic viral stuff out there.

24:17.920 --> 24:23.920
 You know, there will be a narrative and that narrative, whenever there's a narrative, that's kind of a sign of reducibility.

24:23.920 --> 24:32.920
 But when you just say, let's from first principles, figure out what's going on, then you can potentially be stuck in this kind of mess of irreducibility.

24:32.920 --> 24:40.920
 We just have to simulate each step and you can't do that unless you know details about, you know, human interaction networks and so on and so on and so on.

24:40.920 --> 24:52.920
 The thing that has has been very sort of frustrating to see is the mismatch between people's expectations about what science can deliver and what science can actually deliver, so to speak.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.920
 Because people have this idea that, you know, it's science.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.920
 So there must be a definite answer and we must be able to know that answer.

24:59.920 --> 25:10.920
 And, you know, this is it is both, you know, that when you've after you've played around with sort of little programs in the computational universe, you don't have that intuition anymore.

25:10.920 --> 25:17.920
 You know, it's I always I'm always fond of saying, you know, the computational animals are always smarter than you are.

25:17.920 --> 25:22.920
 That is, you know, you look at one of these things and it's like it can't possibly do such and such a thing.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.920
 Then you run it and it's like, wait a minute, it's doing that thing.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.920
 How does that work?

25:26.920 --> 25:28.920
 Okay, now I can go back and understand it.

25:28.920 --> 25:37.920
 But that's the brave thing about science is that in the chaos of the irreducible universe, we nevertheless persist to find those pockets.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.920
 That's kind of the whole point.

25:39.920 --> 25:47.920
 That's like you say that the limits of science, but that, you know, yes, it's highly limited, but there's a hope there.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.920
 And like, there's so many questions I want to ask here.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.920
 So one, you said narrative, which is really interesting.

25:53.920 --> 26:05.920
 So obviously from at every level of society, you look at Twitter, everybody's constructing narratives about the pandemic, about not just the pandemic, but all the cultural tension that we're going through.

26:05.920 --> 26:16.920
 So there's narratives, but they're not necessarily connected to the underlying reality of these systems.

26:16.920 --> 26:31.920
 So our human narratives, I don't even know if they're, I don't like those pockets of reducibility because we're, it's like constructing things that are not actually representative of reality.

26:31.920 --> 26:38.920
 Well, and thereby not giving us like good solutions to how to predict the system.

26:38.920 --> 26:45.920
 Look, it gets complicated because, you know, people want to say, explain the pandemic to me, explain what's going to happen in the future.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.920
 Yes, but also, can you explain it?

26:47.920 --> 26:48.920
 Is there a story to tell?

26:48.920 --> 26:50.920
 What already happened in the past?

26:50.920 --> 26:52.920
 Yeah, or what's going to happen.

26:52.920 --> 26:57.920
 But I mean, you know, it's similar to sort of explaining things in AI or in any computational system.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.920
 It's like, like, you know, explain what happened.

27:00.920 --> 27:05.920
 Well, it could just be this happened because of this detail and this detail and this detail and a million details.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.920
 And there isn't a big story to tell.

27:07.920 --> 27:16.920
 There's no kind of big arc of the story that says, oh, it's because, you know, there's a viral field that has these properties and people start showing symptoms.

27:16.920 --> 27:23.920
 You know, when, when the seasons change, people will show symptoms and people don't even understand, you know, seasonal variation of flu, for example.

27:23.920 --> 27:32.920
 It's a, it's a, it's something where, where, you know, there could be a big story or it could be just a zillion little details that, that mount up.

27:32.920 --> 27:43.920
 See, but okay, let's, let's pretend that this pandemic, like the coronavirus resembles something like the one D rule 30 cellular automata.

27:43.920 --> 27:44.920
 Okay.

27:44.920 --> 27:50.920
 So, I mean, that's how epidemiologists model virus spread.

27:50.920 --> 27:51.920
 Indeed.

27:51.920 --> 27:51.920
 Yes.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.920
 Sometimes you sell your automata.

27:53.920 --> 27:54.920
 Yes.

27:54.920 --> 28:00.920
 And okay, so you can say it's simplistic, but okay, let's say it is it's representative of actually what happens.

28:00.920 --> 28:06.920
 You know, the, the dynamic of you have a graph.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.920
 It's probably as closer to the hypergraph.

28:08.920 --> 28:09.920
 Yes.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.920
 That's another funny thing.

28:11.920 --> 28:12.920
 Yeah.

28:12.920 --> 28:22.920
 As we were getting ready to release this physics project, we realized that a bunch of things we'd worked out about, about foliations of causal graphs and things were directly relevant to thinking about contact tracing.

28:22.920 --> 28:23.920
 Yeah, exactly.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.920
 And interactions of cell phones and so on, which is really weird.

28:26.920 --> 28:39.920
 But like, it just feels like, it feels like we should be able to get some beautiful core insight about the spread of this particular virus on the hypergraph of human civilization, right?

28:39.920 --> 28:40.920
 I tried.

28:40.920 --> 28:41.920
 I didn't, I didn't manage to figure it out.

28:41.920 --> 28:42.920
 But you're one person.

28:42.920 --> 28:43.920
 Yeah.

28:43.920 --> 28:54.920
 But I mean, I think actually it's, it's a funny thing because it turns out the, the main model, you know, this SIR model, I only realized recently was invented by the grandfather of a good friend of mine from high school.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.920
 So that was just a, you know, it's a weird thing.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.920
 Right.

28:58.920 --> 29:06.920
 The question is, you know, okay, so you know, you know, on this graph of how humans are connected, you know, something about what happens if this happens and that happens.

29:06.920 --> 29:16.920
 That graph is made in complicated ways that depends on all sorts of issues that where we don't have the data about how human society works well enough to be able to make that graph.

29:16.920 --> 29:24.920
 There's actually one of my kids did a study of sort of what happens on different kinds of graphs and how robust are the results.

29:24.920 --> 29:25.920
 Okay.

29:25.920 --> 29:34.920
 His basic answer is there are a few general results that you can get that are quite robust, like, you know, a small number of big gatherings is worse than a large number of small gatherings.

29:34.920 --> 29:35.920
 Okay.

29:35.920 --> 29:36.920
 That's quite robust.

29:36.920 --> 29:42.920
 But when you ask more detailed questions, it seemed like it just depends.

29:42.920 --> 29:43.920
 It depends on details.

29:43.920 --> 29:49.920
 In other words, it's kind of telling you in that case, you know, the irreducibility matters, so to speak.

29:49.920 --> 29:56.920
 It's not, there's not going to be this kind of one sort of master theorem that says, and therefore this is how things are going to work.

29:56.920 --> 30:03.920
 Yeah, but there's a certain kind of from a graph perspective, the certain kind of dynamic to human interaction.

30:03.920 --> 30:09.920
 So like large groups and small groups, I think it matters who the groups are.

30:09.920 --> 30:21.920
 For example, you can imagine large depends how you define large, but you can imagine groups of 30 people as long, like, as long as they are cliques or whatever.

30:21.920 --> 30:22.920
 Right.

30:22.920 --> 30:27.920
 As long as the outgoing degree of that graph is small or something like that.

30:27.920 --> 30:38.920
 Like you can imagine some beautiful underlying rule of human dynamic interaction where I can still be happy, where I can have a conversation with you and a bunch of other people that mean a lot to me in my life.

30:38.920 --> 30:49.920
 And then stay away from the bigger, I don't know, not going to a Miley Cyrus concert or something like that and figuring out mathematically some nice rule of behavior.

30:49.920 --> 30:50.920
 See, this is an interesting thing.

30:50.920 --> 31:01.920
 So I mean, in, you know, this is the question of what you're describing is kind of the problem of many situations where you would like to get away from computational irreducibility.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.920
 A classic one in physics is thermodynamics.

31:04.920 --> 31:12.920
 The, you know, the second law of thermodynamics, the law that says, you know, entropy tends to increase things that, you know, start orderly tend to get more disordered.

31:12.920 --> 31:22.920
 Or which is also the thing that says, given that you have a bunch of heat, it's hard heat is, you know, the microscopic motion of molecules, it's hard to turn that heat into systematic mechanical work.

31:22.920 --> 31:32.920
 It's hard to, you know, just take something being hot and turn that into, oh, the, you know, the, all the atoms are going to line up in the bar of metal and the piece of metal is going to shoot in some direction.

31:32.920 --> 31:42.920
 That's essentially the same problem as how do you go from this, this computationally irreducible mess of things happening and get something you want out of it.

31:42.920 --> 31:53.920
 It's kind of mining, you know, you're kind of now, you know, actually, I've, I've understood in recent years that, that the story of, of thermodynamics is actually precisely a story of computational irreducibility.

31:53.920 --> 31:57.920
 But it is a, it is already an analogy.

31:57.920 --> 32:11.920
 You know, you can, you can kind of see that as can you take the, you know, what you're asking to do there is you're asking to go from the kind of the mess of all these complicated human interactions and all this kind of computational processes going on.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.920
 And you say, I want to achieve this particular thing out of it.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.920
 I want to kind of extract from the heat of what's happening.

32:17.920 --> 32:24.920
 I want to kind of extract this useful piece of sort of mechanical work that I find helpful.

32:24.920 --> 32:27.920
 I mean, do you have a hope for the pandemic?

32:27.920 --> 32:30.920
 So we'll talk about physics, but for the pandemic, can that be extracted?

32:30.920 --> 32:31.920
 Do you think?

32:31.920 --> 32:45.920
 Well, I think the good news is the curves, basically, you know, for reasons we don't understand the curves, you know, the, the, the clearly measurable mortality clouds and so on for the northern hemisphere have gone down.

32:45.920 --> 33:01.920
 Yeah, but the bad news is that it could be a lot worse for future viruses and what this pandemic revealed is we're highly unprepared for the discovery of the pockets of reducibility within a pandemic that's much more dangerous.

33:01.920 --> 33:11.920
 Well, my guess is the specific risk of, you know, viral pandemics, you know, that the pure virology and, you know, immunology of the thing.

33:11.920 --> 33:17.920
 This will cause that to advance to the point where this particular risk is probably considerably mitigated.

33:17.920 --> 33:25.920
 But, you know, it's, you know, does, is the structure of modern society robust to all kinds of risks?

33:25.920 --> 33:28.920
 Well, the answer is clearly no.

33:28.920 --> 33:38.920
 And, you know, it's surprising to me the extent to which people, you know, as I say, it's a, it's a, it's kind of scary actually how much people believe in science.

33:38.920 --> 33:47.920
 That is, people say, oh, you know, because the science says this, that and the other will do this and this and this, even though from a sort of common sense point of view, it's a little bit crazy.

33:47.920 --> 33:55.920
 And people are not prepared and it doesn't really work in society as it is for people to say, well, actually we don't really know how the science works.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.920
 People say, well, tell us what to do.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.920
 Yeah, because then, yeah, what's the alternative?

33:59.920 --> 34:08.920
 The, for the masses, it's difficult to sit, it's difficult to meditate on computational reducibility.

34:08.920 --> 34:15.920
 It's difficult to sit, it's difficult to enjoy a good dinner meal while, while knowing that you know nothing about the world.

34:15.920 --> 34:24.920
 I think this is a, this is a place where, you know, this is, this is what politicians, you know, and political leaders do for a living, so to speak, because you got to make some decision about what to do.

34:24.920 --> 34:25.920
 And it's some.

34:25.920 --> 34:26.920
 Tell some narrative.

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
 Right.

34:27.920 --> 34:38.920
 While amidst the mystery and knowing not much about the, the past or the future, still telling a narrative that somehow gives people hope that we know what the heck we're doing.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.920
 Yeah, and get society through the issue.

34:40.920 --> 34:49.920
 You know, even, even though, you know, the idea that we're just going to, you know, sort of be able to get the definitive answer from science and it's going to tell us exactly what to do.

34:49.920 --> 35:03.920
 Unfortunately, you know, that it's interesting because let me point out that if that was possible, if science could always tell us what to do, then in a sense, our, you know, that will be a big downer for our lives.

35:03.920 --> 35:05.920
 If science could always tell us what the answer is going to be.

35:05.920 --> 35:10.920
 It's like, well, you know, it's kind of fun to live one's life and just sort of see what happens.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.920
 If one could always just say, let me, let me check my science.

35:13.920 --> 35:17.920
 Oh, I know, you know, the result of everything is going to be 42.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.920
 I don't need to live my life and do what I do.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.920
 It's just, we already know the answer.

35:22.920 --> 35:32.920
 It's actually good news in a sense that there is this phenomenon of computational irreducibility that doesn't allow you to just sort of jump through time and say this is the answer, so to speak.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.920
 And that's, so that's a good thing.

35:34.920 --> 35:39.920
 The bad thing is it doesn't allow you to jump through time and know what the answer is.

35:39.920 --> 35:40.920
 It's scary.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.920
 Do you think we're going to be okay as a human civilization?

35:43.920 --> 35:45.920
 He said, we don't know.

35:45.920 --> 35:46.920
 Absolutely.

35:46.920 --> 35:53.920
 Do you think we'll prosper or destroy ourselves as a...

35:53.920 --> 35:54.920
 In general?

35:54.920 --> 35:55.920
 In general.

35:55.920 --> 35:56.920
 I'm an optimist.

35:56.920 --> 36:02.920
 No, I think that, you know, it'll be interesting to see, for example, with this, you know, pandemic.

36:02.920 --> 36:15.920
 You know, to me, you know, when you look at like organizations, for example, you know, having some kind of perturbation, some kick to the system, usually the end result of that is actually quite good.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.920
 You know, unless it kills the system, it's actually quite good usually.

36:18.920 --> 36:27.920
 And I think in this case, you know, people, I mean, my impression, you know, it's a little weird for me because, you know, I've been a remote tax CEO for 30 years.

36:27.920 --> 36:40.920
 It doesn't, you know, this is bizarrely, you know, and the fact that, you know, like this coming to see you here is the first time in six months that I've been like, you know, in a building other than my house.

36:40.920 --> 36:46.920
 Okay, so, you know, I'm a kind of ridiculous outlier in these kinds of things.

36:46.920 --> 36:56.920
 But overall, your sense is when you shake up the system and throw in chaos that you challenge the system, we humans emerge better.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.920
 Seems to be that way.

36:58.920 --> 36:59.920
 Who's to know?

36:59.920 --> 37:06.920
 But I think that, you know, people, you know, my sort of vague impression is that people are sort of, you know, oh, what's actually important?

37:06.920 --> 37:10.920
 You know, what's, what, what is worth caring about and so on?

37:10.920 --> 37:16.920
 And that seems to be something that perhaps is, is more, you know, emergent in this kind of situation.

37:16.920 --> 37:25.920
 It's so fascinating that on the individual level, we have our own complex cognition, we have consciousness, we have intelligence with trying to figure out little puzzles.

37:25.920 --> 37:29.920
 And then that somehow creates this graph of collective intelligence.

37:29.920 --> 37:37.920
 Well, we figure out, and then you throw in these viruses of which there's millions different, you know, there's entire taxonomy.

37:37.920 --> 37:44.920
 And the viruses are thrown into the system of collective human intelligence and little humans figure out what to do about it.

37:44.920 --> 37:52.920
 We get like, we tweet stuff about information, there's doctors as conspiracy theorists, and then we play with different information.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.920
 I mean, the whole of it is fascinating.

37:54.920 --> 38:02.920
 I like you also very optimistic, but there's a few just you said the computation or reducibility.

38:02.920 --> 38:08.920
 There's always a fear of the darkness of the uncertainty before us.

38:08.920 --> 38:13.920
 Yeah, no, I mean, the thing is, if you knew everything, it will be boring.

38:13.920 --> 38:23.920
 And it would be and then and worse than boring, so to speak, it would be you, it would reveal the pointlessness, so to speak.

38:23.920 --> 38:31.920
 And in a sense, the fact that there is this computational reducibility, it's like as we live our lives, so to speak, something is being achieved.

38:31.920 --> 38:36.920
 We're computing what our lives, you know, what happens in our lives.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.920
 That's funny.

38:37.920 --> 38:41.920
 So the computation or reducibility is kind of like, it gives the meaning to life.

38:41.920 --> 38:42.920
 It is the meaning of life.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.920
 Computation or reducibility is the meaning of life.

38:44.920 --> 38:45.920
 There you go.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
 It gives it meaning.

38:46.920 --> 38:57.920
 Yes, I mean, it's what it's what causes it to not be something where you can just say, you know, you went through all those steps to live your life, but we already knew what the answer was.

38:57.920 --> 38:58.920
 Hold on one second.

38:58.920 --> 39:05.920
 I'm going to use my handy Wolf Malphur sunburn computation thing so long as I can get network here.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.920
 There we go.

39:07.920 --> 39:08.920
 No, actually, you know what?

39:08.920 --> 39:10.920
 It says sunburn unlikely.

39:10.920 --> 39:14.920
 This is a QA moment.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.920
 This is a good moment.

39:16.920 --> 39:17.920
 Okay.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.920
 Well, let me just check what it thinks.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.920
 I would see why it thinks that it doesn't seem like my intuition.

39:22.920 --> 39:29.920
 This is one of these cases where we can, the question is, do we, do we trust the science or do we use common sense?

39:29.920 --> 39:31.920
 The UV thing is cool.

39:31.920 --> 39:32.920
 Yeah.

39:32.920 --> 39:33.920
 Yeah.

39:33.920 --> 39:34.920
 Well, we'll see.

39:34.920 --> 39:37.920
 This is a QA moment, as I say, and so we trust the product.

39:37.920 --> 39:38.920
 Yes.

39:38.920 --> 39:39.920
 We trust the product.

39:39.920 --> 39:40.920
 And then there'll be a data point.

39:40.920 --> 39:41.920
 Either way.

39:41.920 --> 39:46.920
 If I'm desperately sunburned, I will send in an angry feedback.

39:46.920 --> 39:53.920
 Because we mentioned the concept so much, and a lot of people know it, but can you say what computation or usability is?

39:53.920 --> 39:54.920
 Yeah, right.

39:54.920 --> 40:08.920
 So the question is, if you think about things that happen as being computations, you think about the, some process in physics, something that you compute in mathematics, whatever else.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.920
 It's a computation in the sense it has definite rules.

40:11.920 --> 40:12.920
 You follow those rules.

40:12.920 --> 40:17.920
 You follow them many steps and you get some result.

40:17.920 --> 40:28.920
 So then the issue is, if you look at all these different kinds of computations that can happen, whether they're computations that are happening in the natural world, whether they're happening in our brains, whether they're happening in our mathematics, whatever else.

40:28.920 --> 40:31.920
 The big question is, how do these computations compare?

40:31.920 --> 40:34.920
 Is, are there dumb computations and smart computations?

40:34.920 --> 40:36.920
 Or are they somehow all equivalent?

40:36.920 --> 40:47.920
 And the thing that I kind of was sort of surprised to realize from a bunch of experiments that I did in the early 90s, and now we have tons more evidence for it, this thing I call the principle of computational equivalence.

40:47.920 --> 41:02.920
 Which basically says, when one of these computations, one of these processes that follows rules, doesn't seem like it's doing something obviously simple, then it has reached the sort of equivalent level of computational sophistication of everything.

41:02.920 --> 41:03.920
 So what does that mean?

41:03.920 --> 41:10.920
 That means that you might say, gosh, I'm studying this little tiny program on my computer.

41:10.920 --> 41:17.920
 I'm studying this little thing in nature, but I have my brain and my brain is surely much smarter than that thing.

41:17.920 --> 41:24.920
 I'm going to be able to systematically outrun the computation that it does because I have a more sophisticated computation that I can do.

41:24.920 --> 41:28.920
 But what the principle of computational equivalence says is that doesn't work.

41:28.920 --> 41:36.920
 Our brains are doing computations that are exactly equivalent to the kinds of computations that are being done in all these other sorts of systems.

41:36.920 --> 41:37.920
 And so what consequences does that have?

41:37.920 --> 41:41.920
 Well, it means that we can't systematically outrun these systems.

41:41.920 --> 41:49.920
 These systems are computationally irreducible in the sense that there's no sort of shortcut that we can make that jumps to the answer.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.920
 In a general case.

41:51.920 --> 41:52.920
 Right.

41:52.920 --> 42:05.920
 But so what has happened, what science has become used to doing is using the little sort of pockets of computational reducibility, which, by the way, are an inevitable consequence of computational irreducibility,

42:05.920 --> 42:14.920
 that there have to be these pockets scattered around of computational reducibility to be able to find those particular cases where you can jump ahead.

42:14.920 --> 42:19.920
 I mean, one thing sort of a little bit of a parable type thing that I think is fun to tell.

42:19.920 --> 42:24.920
 If you look at ancient Babylon, they were trying to predict three kinds of things.

42:24.920 --> 42:31.920
 They tried to predict where the planets would be, what the weather would be like, and who would win or lose a certain battle.

42:31.920 --> 42:35.920
 And they had no idea which of these things would be more predictable than the other.

42:35.920 --> 42:36.920
 That's funny.

42:36.920 --> 42:45.920
 And it turns out where the planets are is a piece of computational reducibility that 300 years ago or so we pretty much cracked.

42:45.920 --> 42:50.920
 I mean, it's been technically difficult to get all the details right, but it's basically, we got that.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.920
 You know, who's going to win or lose the battle?

42:53.920 --> 42:54.920
 No, we didn't crack that one.

42:54.920 --> 42:55.920
 That one.

42:55.920 --> 42:56.920
 Right.

42:56.920 --> 42:58.920
 Game theorists are trying.

42:58.920 --> 42:59.920
 And then the weather.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.920
 It's kind of halfway.

43:01.920 --> 43:02.920
 Halfway.

43:02.920 --> 43:04.920
 Yeah, I think we're doing okay with that one.

43:04.920 --> 43:06.920
 Long term climate, different story.

43:06.920 --> 43:09.920
 But the weather, you know, we're much closer on that.

43:09.920 --> 43:17.920
 But do you think eventually we'll figure out the weather? So do you think eventually most think we'll figure out the local pockets in everything?

43:17.920 --> 43:19.920
 Essentially, the local pockets of reducibility?

43:19.920 --> 43:22.920
 No, I think that it's an interesting question.

43:22.920 --> 43:28.920
 But I think that the, you know, there is an infinite collection of these local pockets will never run out of local pockets.

43:28.920 --> 43:32.920
 And by the way, those local pockets are where we build engineering, for example.

43:32.920 --> 43:42.920
 That's how we, you know, when we, if we want to have a predictable life, so to speak, then, you know, we have to build in these sort of pockets of reducibility.

43:42.920 --> 43:52.920
 Otherwise, you know, if we were, if we were sort of existing in this kind of irreducible world, we'd never be able to, you know, have definite things to know what's going to happen.

43:52.920 --> 44:01.920
 You know, I have to say, I think one of the features, you know, when we look at sort of today from the future, so to speak, I suspect one of the things where people will say,

44:01.920 --> 44:06.920
 I can't believe they didn't see that is stuff to do with the following kind of thing.

44:06.920 --> 44:18.920
 So, you know, if we describe, oh, I don't know, something like heat, for instance, we say, oh, you know, the air in here, it's, you know, it's this temperature, this pressure.

44:18.920 --> 44:20.920
 That's as much as we can say.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.920
 Otherwise, just a bunch of random molecules bouncing around.

44:22.920 --> 44:31.920
 People will say, I just can't believe they didn't realize that there was all this detail in how all these molecules were bouncing around, and they could make use of that.

44:31.920 --> 44:42.920
 And actually, I realized there's a thing I realized last week, actually, was a thing that people say, you know, one of the scenarios for the very long term history of our universe is the so called heat death of the universe,

44:42.920 --> 44:46.920
 where basically everything just becomes thermodynamically boring.

44:46.920 --> 44:52.920
 Everything's just this big kind of gas and thermal equilibrium, people say, that's a really bad outcome.

44:52.920 --> 44:54.920
 But actually, it's not a really bad outcome.

44:54.920 --> 45:03.920
 It's an outcome where there's all this computation going on, and all those individual gas molecules are all bouncing around in very complicated ways, doing this very elaborate computation.

45:03.920 --> 45:09.920
 It just happens to be a computation that right now, we haven't found ways to understand.

45:09.920 --> 45:17.920
 We haven't found ways, you know, our brains haven't, you know, and our mathematics and our science and so on, haven't found ways to tell an interesting story about that.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.920
 It just looks boring to us.

45:19.920 --> 45:30.920
 You're saying there's a hopeful view of the heat death, quote unquote, of the universe where there's actual beautiful complexity going on.

45:30.920 --> 45:37.920
 Similar to the kind of complexity we think of that creates rich experience in human life and life on Earth.

45:37.920 --> 45:38.920
 Yes.

45:38.920 --> 45:43.920
 And those little molecules interacting complex ways that could be intelligence in that there could be.

45:43.920 --> 45:44.920
 Absolutely.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.920
 I mean, this is what you learn from this principle.

45:46.920 --> 45:47.920
 That's a hopeful message.

45:47.920 --> 45:48.920
 Right.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.920
 I mean, this is what you kind of learn from this principle of computational equivalence.

45:51.920 --> 46:01.920
 You learn it's both a message of sort of hope and a message of kind of, you know, you're not as special as you think you are, so to speak.

46:01.920 --> 46:09.920
 You know, we we imagine that with sort of all the things we do with with human intelligence and all that kind of thing and all of the stuff we've constructed in science.

46:09.920 --> 46:11.920
 It's like, we're very special.

46:11.920 --> 46:14.920
 But actually, it turns out, well, no, we're not.

46:14.920 --> 46:22.920
 We're just doing computations like things in nature do computations like those gas molecules do computations like the weather does computations.

46:22.920 --> 46:30.920
 The only the only thing about the computations that we do that's really special is that we understand what they are, so to speak.

46:30.920 --> 46:38.920
 In other words, we have a, you know, to us, the special because kind of they're connected to our purposes, our ways of thinking about things and so on.

46:38.920 --> 46:41.920
 And that's some but so that's very human centric.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.920
 That's we're just attached to this kind of thing.

46:44.920 --> 46:47.920
 So let's talk a little bit of physics.

46:47.920 --> 46:50.920
 Maybe let's ask the biggest question.

46:50.920 --> 46:54.920
 What is a theory of everything in general?

46:54.920 --> 46:55.920
 What does that mean?

46:55.920 --> 47:21.920
 Yeah, so I mean, the question is, can we kind of reduce what has been physics as a something where we have to sort of pick away and say, do we roughly know how the world works to something where we have a complete formal theory where we say if we were to run this program for long enough, we would reproduce everything, you know, down to the fact that we're having this conversation at this moment, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

47:21.920 --> 47:24.920
 Any physical phenomena, any phenomena in this world.

47:24.920 --> 47:26.920
 Phenomenon in the universe.

47:26.920 --> 47:35.920
 But the, you know, because of computational irreducibility, it's not, you know, that's not something where you say, okay, you've got the fundamental theory of everything.

47:35.920 --> 47:41.920
 Then, you know, tell me whether, you know, lions are going to eat tigers or something.

47:41.920 --> 47:49.920
 You know, that's a, no, you have to run this thing for, you know, 10 to the 500 steps or something to know something like that.

47:49.920 --> 47:58.920
 Okay, so at some moment, potentially, you say, this is a rule and run this rule enough times and you will get the whole universe.

47:58.920 --> 47:59.920
 Right.

47:59.920 --> 48:05.920
 That's, that's what it means to kind of have a fundamental theory of physics as far as I'm concerned is you've got this rule.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.920
 It's potentially quite simple.

48:07.920 --> 48:11.920
 We don't know for sure it's simple, but we have various reasons to believe it might be simple.

48:11.920 --> 48:19.920
 And then you say, okay, I'm showing you this rule, you just run it only 10 to the 500 times and you'll get everything.

48:19.920 --> 48:24.920
 In other words, you've kind of reduced the problem of physics to a problem of mathematics, so to speak.

48:24.920 --> 48:28.920
 It's like, it's as if, you know, you'd like to generate the digits of pi.

48:28.920 --> 48:31.920
 There's a definite procedure, you just generate them.

48:31.920 --> 48:36.920
 And it'd be the same thing if you have a fundamental theory of physics of the kind that I'm imagining.

48:36.920 --> 48:44.920
 You, you know, you get a, this rule and you just run it out and you get everything that happens in the universe.

48:44.920 --> 48:55.920
 So a theory of everything is a mathematical framework within which you can explain everything that happens in a universe.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.920
 It's kind of in a unified way.

48:57.920 --> 48:58.920
 It's not.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.920
 There's a bunch of disparate modules.

49:00.920 --> 49:02.920
 Right.

49:02.920 --> 49:11.920
 Does it feel like if you create a rule and we'll talk about the Wolfram physics model, which is fascinating.

49:11.920 --> 49:24.920
 But if you, if you have a simple set of rules with a, with a data structure, like a hypograph, does that feel like a satisfying theory of everything?

49:24.920 --> 49:31.920
 Because then you really run up against the irreducibility, computational reducibility.

49:31.920 --> 49:33.920
 Right. So that's a really interesting question.

49:33.920 --> 49:49.920
 So I, I, you know, what I thought was going to happen is I thought we, you know, I thought we had a pretty good, I had a pretty good idea for what the structure of this sort of theory that's sort of underneath space and time and so on might be like.

49:49.920 --> 49:57.920
 And I thought, gosh, you know, in my lifetime, so to speak, we might be able to figure out what happens in the first 10 to the minus 100 seconds of the universe.

49:57.920 --> 50:06.920
 And that would be cool, but it's pretty far away from anything that we can see today and it will be hard to test whether that's right and so on and so on and so on.

50:06.920 --> 50:17.920
 To my huge surprise, although it should have been obvious and it's embarrassing that it wasn't obvious to me, but, but to my huge surprise, we managed to get unbelievably much further than that.

50:17.920 --> 50:29.920
 And basically what happened is that it turns out that even though there's this kind of bed of computational irreducibility, that sort of these, all these simple rules run into.

50:29.920 --> 50:37.920
 There is a, there are certain pieces of computational reducibility that quite generically occur for large classes of these rules.

50:37.920 --> 50:48.920
 And, and this is the really exciting thing as far as I'm concerned, the, the, the big pieces of computational reducibility are basically the pillars of 20th century physics.

50:48.920 --> 50:58.920
 That's the amazing thing that general relativity and quantum field theory, the sort of the pillars of 20th century physics turn out to be precisely the stuff you can say.

50:58.920 --> 51:04.920
 There's a lot you can't say there's a lot that's kind of at this irreducible level where you kind of don't know what's going to happen.

51:04.920 --> 51:09.920
 You have to run it, you know, you can't run it within our universe, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

51:09.920 --> 51:23.920
 But the thing is there are things you can say, and the things you can say turn out to be very beautifully exactly the structure that was found in 20th century physics, namely general relativity and quantum mechanics.

51:23.920 --> 51:36.920
 And general relativity and quantum mechanics are these pockets of reducibility that we think of as that, that 20th century physics is essentially pockets of reducibility.

51:36.920 --> 51:47.920
 And then it's, it is incredibly surprising that any kind of model that's generative from simple rules would have, would have such pockets.

51:47.920 --> 51:56.920
 Yeah, well, I think what's surprising is we didn't know where those things came from. It's like general relativity, it's a very nice mathematically elegant theory.

51:56.920 --> 52:00.920
 Why is it true? You know, quantum mechanics, why is it true?

52:00.920 --> 52:13.920
 What we realized is that from this, that they are, these theories are generic to a huge class of systems that have these particular very unstructured underlying rules.

52:13.920 --> 52:20.920
 And that's the, that's the thing that is sort of remarkable. And that's the thing to me that's just, it's really beautiful.

52:20.920 --> 52:26.920
 I mean, it's, and the thing that's even more beautiful is that it turns out that, you know, people have been struggling for a long time.

52:26.920 --> 52:30.920
 You know, how does general relativity theory of gravity relate to quantum mechanics?

52:30.920 --> 52:32.920
 They seem to have all kinds of incompatibilities.

52:32.920 --> 52:37.920
 It turns out what we realized is at some level they are the same theory.

52:37.920 --> 52:41.920
 And that's just, it's, it's just great as far as I'm concerned.

52:41.920 --> 52:48.920
 Maybe like taking a little step back from your perspective, not from the low, not from the beautiful,

52:48.920 --> 52:54.920
 hypergraph, well, from physics model perspective, but from the perspective of 20th century physics.

52:54.920 --> 52:57.920
 What is general relativity? What is quantum mechanics?

52:57.920 --> 53:03.920
 How do you think about these two theories from the context of the theory of everything?

53:03.920 --> 53:05.920
 It's just even definitions.

53:05.920 --> 53:08.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. So I mean, you know, a little bit of history of physics, right?

53:08.920 --> 53:12.920
 So, so I mean the, the, you know, okay, very, very quick history.

53:12.920 --> 53:18.920
 Yes. Right. So, so I mean, you know, physics, you know, in ancient Greek times, people basically said,

53:18.920 --> 53:23.920
 we can just figure out how the world works as, you know, we're philosophers, we're going to figure out how the world works.

53:23.920 --> 53:29.920
 You know, some philosophers thought there were atoms, some philosophers thought there were, you know, continuous flows of things.

53:29.920 --> 53:32.920
 People had different ideas about how the world works.

53:32.920 --> 53:35.920
 And they tried to just say, we're going to construct this idea of how the world works.

53:35.920 --> 53:40.920
 They didn't really have sort of notions of doing experiments and so on quite the same way as developed later.

53:40.920 --> 53:45.920
 So that was sort of an early tradition for thinking about sort of models of the world.

53:45.920 --> 53:53.920
 Then by the time of 1600s, time of Galileo and then Newton, sort of the big, the big idea there was, you know,

53:53.920 --> 53:56.920
 you know, title of Newton's book, you know, Principia Mathematica,

53:56.920 --> 53:59.920
 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.

53:59.920 --> 54:06.920
 We can use mathematics to understand natural philosophy, to understand things about the way the world works.

54:06.920 --> 54:11.920
 And so that then led to this kind of idea that, you know, we can write down a mathematical equation

54:11.920 --> 54:14.920
 and have that represent how the world works.

54:14.920 --> 54:18.920
 So Newton's one of his most famous ones is his universal law of gravity,

54:18.920 --> 54:24.920
 inverse square law of gravity that allowed him to compute all sorts of features of the planets and so on,

54:24.920 --> 54:30.920
 although some of them he got wrong and it took another 100 years for people to actually be able to do the math to the level that was needed.

54:30.920 --> 54:35.920
 But so that had been, this sort of tradition was we write down these mathematical equations.

54:35.920 --> 54:37.920
 We don't really know where these equations come from.

54:37.920 --> 54:42.920
 We write them down, then we figure out, we work out the consequences and we say,

54:42.920 --> 54:46.920
 yes, that agrees with what we actually observe in astronomy or something like this.

54:46.920 --> 54:54.920
 So that tradition continued and then the first of these two sort of great 20th century innovations was,

54:54.920 --> 55:02.920
 well, the history is actually a little bit more complicated, but let's say there were two, quantum mechanics and general relativity.

55:02.920 --> 55:11.920
 Quantum mechanics, kind of 1900 was kind of the very early stuff done by Planck that led to the idea of photons, particles of light.

55:11.920 --> 55:14.920
 But let's take general relativity first.

55:14.920 --> 55:26.920
 One feature of the story is that special relativity thing Einstein invented in 1905 was something which surprisingly was a kind of logically invented theory.

55:26.920 --> 55:34.920
 It was not a theory where it was something where, given these ideas that were sort of axiomatically thought to be true about the world,

55:34.920 --> 55:37.920
 it followed that such and such a thing would be the case.

55:37.920 --> 55:45.920
 And it was a little bit different from the kind of methodological structure of some existing theories in the more recent times.

55:45.920 --> 55:48.920
 Or it had just been, we write down an equation and we find out that it works.

55:48.920 --> 55:50.920
 So what happened there?

55:50.920 --> 55:52.920
 So there's some reasoning about the light.

55:52.920 --> 55:58.920
 The basic idea was the speed of light appears to be constant.

55:58.920 --> 56:06.920
 Even if you're traveling very fast, you shine a flashlight, the light will come out, even if you're going at half the speed of light,

56:06.920 --> 56:10.920
 the light doesn't come out of your flashlight at one and a half times the speed of light.

56:10.920 --> 56:12.920
 It's still just the speed of light.

56:12.920 --> 56:20.920
 And to make that work, you have to change your view of how space and time work to be able to account for the fact that when you're going faster,

56:20.920 --> 56:25.920
 it appears that, you know, length is foreshortened and time is dilated and things like this.

56:25.920 --> 56:26.920
 And that's special relativity.

56:26.920 --> 56:27.920
 That's special relativity.

56:27.920 --> 56:38.920
 So then Einstein went on with sort of vaguely similar kinds of thinking in 1915 invented general relativity, which is a theory of gravity.

56:38.920 --> 56:48.920
 And the basic point of general relativity is it's a theory that says when there is mass in space, space is curved.

56:48.920 --> 56:50.920
 And what does that mean?

56:50.920 --> 56:59.920
 You know, usually you think of what's the shortest distance between two points, like, you know, ordinarily on a plane in space, it's a straight line.

56:59.920 --> 57:03.920
 You know, photons, light goes in straight lines.

57:03.920 --> 57:11.920
 Well, then the question is, if you have a curved surface, a straight line is no longer straight.

57:11.920 --> 57:15.920
 On the surface of the earth, the shortest distance between two points is a great circle.

57:15.920 --> 57:16.920
 It's a circle.

57:16.920 --> 57:25.920
 So, you know, Einstein's observation was maybe the physical structure of space is such that space is curved.

57:25.920 --> 57:33.920
 So the shortest distance between two points, the path, the straight line in quotes won't be straight anymore.

57:33.920 --> 57:41.920
 And in particular, if a photon is, you know, traveling near the sun or something or if a particle is going, something is traveling near the sun,

57:41.920 --> 57:52.920
 maybe the shortest path will be one that is something which looks curved to us because it seems curved to us because space has been deformed by the presence of mass,

57:52.920 --> 57:54.920
 associated with that massive object.

57:54.920 --> 58:02.920
 So the kind of the idea there is think of the structure of space as being a dynamical changing kind of thing.

58:02.920 --> 58:09.920
 But then what Einstein did was he wrote down these differential equations that basically represented the curvature of space

58:09.920 --> 58:12.920
 and its response to the presence of mass and energy.

58:12.920 --> 58:24.920
 And that ultimately is connected to the force of gravity, which is one of the forces that seems to, based on its strength, operate on a different scale than some of the other forces.

58:24.920 --> 58:27.920
 So it operates in a scale that's very large.

58:27.920 --> 58:35.920
 What happens there is just this curvature of space, which causes, you know, the paths of objects to be deflected.

58:35.920 --> 58:36.920
 That's what gravity does.

58:36.920 --> 58:38.920
 It causes the paths of objects to be deflected.

58:38.920 --> 58:42.920
 And this is an explanation for gravity, so to speak.

58:42.920 --> 58:51.920
 And the surprise is that from 1915 until today, everything that we've measured about gravity precisely agrees with General Altsoverty.

58:51.920 --> 58:58.920
 And that, you know, it wasn't clear black holes were sort of a predict, well actually the expansion of the universe was an early potential prediction,

58:58.920 --> 59:07.920
 although Einstein tried to sort of patch up his equations to make it not cause the universe to expand because it was kind of so obvious the universe wasn't expanding.

59:07.920 --> 59:11.920
 And, you know, it turns out it was expanding and he should have just trusted the equations.

59:11.920 --> 59:24.920
 And that's a lesson for those of us interested in making fundamental theories of physics is you should trust your theory and not try and patch it because of something that you think might be the case that might turn out not to be the case.

59:24.920 --> 59:27.920
 Even if the theory says something crazy is happening.

59:27.920 --> 59:28.920
 Yeah, right.

59:28.920 --> 59:29.920
 Like the universe is expanding.

59:29.920 --> 59:41.920
 Right, which is, but you know, then it took until the 1940s, probably even really until the 1960s until people understood that black holes were a consequence of General Altsoverty and so on.

59:41.920 --> 59:54.920
 But that's, you know, the big surprise has been that so far this theory of gravity has perfectly agreed with, you know, these collisions of black holes seen by their gravitational waves, you know, it all just works.

59:54.920 --> 1:00:02.920
 So that's been kind of one pillar of the story of physics. It's mathematically complicated to work out the consequences of General Altsoverty, but it's not.

1:00:02.920 --> 1:00:10.920
 There's no, I mean, and some things are kind of squiggly and complicated, like people believe, you know, energy is conserved.

1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:15.920
 Okay, well, energy conservation doesn't really work in General Altsoverty in the same way as it ordinarily does.

1:00:15.920 --> 1:00:27.920
 And it's all a big mathematical story of how you actually nail down something that is definitive that you can talk about it and not specific to the, you know, reference frames you're operating in and so on and so on and so on.

1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:33.920
 But fundamentally, General Altsoverty is a straight shot in the sense that you have this theory, you work out its consequences.

1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:45.920
 And that theory is useful in terms of basic science and trying to understand the way black holes work, the way the creation of galaxies work, sort of all of these kind of cosmological things.

1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:52.920
 Understanding what happened, like you said, at the Big Bang, like all those kinds of, oh no, not at the Big Bang actually, right?

1:00:52.920 --> 1:01:01.920
 Well, features of the expansion of the universe, yes. I mean, and there are lots of details where we don't quite know how it's working, you know, is there, you know, where's the dark matter?

1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:09.920
 Is there dark energy, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But fundamentally, the, you know, the testable features of General Altsoverty, it all works very beautifully.

1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:16.920
 And it's, in a sense, it is mathematically sophisticated, but it is not conceptually hard to understand in some sense.

1:01:16.920 --> 1:01:22.920
 Okay, so that's General Altsoverty. And once it's friendly neighbor, like you said, there's two theories, quantum mechanics.

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:30.920
 Right. So quantum mechanics, the sort of, the way that that originated was, one question was, is the world continuous or is it discrete?

1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:37.920
 You know, in ancient Greek times, people have been debating this. People debated it in, you know, throughout history as light made of waves.

1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:42.920
 Is it continuous? Is it discrete? Is it made of particles, corpuscles, whatever?

1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:50.920
 You know, what had become clear in the 1800s is that atoms, that, you know, materials are made of discrete atoms.

1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:58.920
 You know, when you take some water, the water is not a continuous fluid, even though it seems like a continuous fluid to us at our scale.

1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:05.920
 But if you say, let's look at it, smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller scale, eventually you get down to these, you know, these molecules and then atoms.

1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:12.920
 It's made of discrete things. So the question is sort of how important is this discreteness, just what's discrete, what's not discrete?

1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:16.920
 Is energy discrete? Is, you know, what's discrete, what's not?

1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:17.920
 And so...

1:02:17.920 --> 1:02:20.920
 Does it have mass, those kinds of questions?

1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:27.920
 Yeah, yeah, right. Well, there's question, I mean, for example, is mass discrete is an interesting question, which is now something we can address.

1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:34.920
 But, you know, what happened in the coming up to the 1920s?

1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:43.920
 There was this kind of mathematical theory developed that could explain certain kinds of discreteness in particularly in features of atoms and so on.

1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:52.920
 And, you know, what developed was this mathematical theory that was the theory of quantum mechanics, theory of wave functions, Schrodinger's equation, things like this.

1:02:52.920 --> 1:03:01.920
 That's a mathematical theory that allows you to calculate lots of features of the microscopic world, lots of things about how atoms work, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:04.920
 Now, the calculations all work just great.

1:03:04.920 --> 1:03:09.920
 The question of what does it really mean is a complicated question.

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:19.920
 Now, I mean, to just explain a little bit historically, the, you know, the early calculations of things like atoms worked great in the 1920s and 1930s and so on.

1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:33.920
 There was always a problem there were in quantum field theory, which is a theory of in quantum mechanics, you're dealing with a certain number of certain number of electrons, and you fix the number of electrons, you say, I'm dealing with a two electron thing.

1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:37.920
 In quantum field theory, you allow for particles being created and destroyed.

1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:42.920
 So you can emit a photon that didn't exist before you can absorb a photon, things like that.

1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:49.920
 That's a more complicated, mathematically complicated theory, and it had all kinds of mathematical issues and all kinds of infinities that cropped up.

1:03:49.920 --> 1:03:52.920
 And it was finally figured out more or less how to get rid of those.

1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:58.920
 But there were only certain ways of doing the calculations, and those didn't work for atomic nuclei, among other things.

1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:09.920
 And that led to a lot of development up until the 1960s of alternative ideas for how, how one could understand what was happening in atomic nuclei, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:19.920
 And result in the end, the kind of most, quote, obvious mathematical structure of quantum field theory seems to work, although it's mathematically difficult to deal with.

1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:22.920
 But you can calculate all kinds of things.

1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:27.920
 You can calculate, you know, a dozen decimal places, certain things, you can measure them, it all works.

1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:28.920
 It's all beautiful.

1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:29.920
 Now you say...

1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:35.920
 The underlying fabric is the model of that particular theory is fields, like you keep saying fields.

1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:39.920
 Those are quantum fields, those are different from classical fields.

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:46.920
 A field is something like you say the temperature field in this room.

1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:50.920
 It's like there is a value of temperature at every point around the room.

1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:56.920
 Or you can say the wind field would be the vector direction of the wind at every point.

1:04:56.920 --> 1:04:57.920
 It's continuous.

1:04:57.920 --> 1:04:58.920
 Yes.

1:04:58.920 --> 1:04:59.920
 And that's a classical field.

1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:03.920
 The quantum field is a much more mathematically elaborate kind of thing.

1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:13.920
 And I should explain that one of the pictures of quantum mechanics that's really important is, you know, in classical physics, one believes that sort of definite things happen in the world.

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:21.920
 You pick up a ball, you throw it, the ball goes in a definite trajectory that has certain equations of motion, it goes in a parabola, whatever else.

1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:26.920
 In quantum mechanics, the picture is definite things don't happen.

1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:34.920
 Instead, sort of what happens is this whole sort of structure of all, you know, many different paths being followed.

1:05:34.920 --> 1:05:39.920
 And we can calculate certain aspects of what happens, certain probabilities of different outcomes and so on.

1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:41.920
 And you say, well, what really happened?

1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:42.920
 What's really going on?

1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:46.920
 What's the sort of, what's the underlying, you know, what's the underlying story?

1:05:46.920 --> 1:05:55.920
 How do we turn this mathematical theory that we can calculate things with into something that we can really understand and have a narrative about?

1:05:55.920 --> 1:05:58.920
 And that's been really, really hard for quantum mechanics.

1:05:58.920 --> 1:06:08.920
 My friend, Dick Feynman, always used to say, nobody understands quantum mechanics, even though he'd made his, you know, whole career out of calculating things about quantum mechanics.

1:06:08.920 --> 1:06:10.920
 And, you know, so it's a little...

1:06:10.920 --> 1:06:19.920
 But nevertheless, it's what the quantum field theory is very, very accurate at predicting a lot of the physical phenomena.

1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:20.920
 So it works.

1:06:20.920 --> 1:06:21.920
 Yeah.

1:06:21.920 --> 1:06:31.920
 But there are things about it, you know, it has certain, when we apply it, the standard model of particle physics, for example, we, you know, which we apply to calculate all kinds of things.

1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:32.920
 It works really well.

1:06:32.920 --> 1:06:34.920
 And you say, well, it has certain parameters.

1:06:34.920 --> 1:06:36.920
 It has a whole bunch of parameters, actually.

1:06:36.920 --> 1:06:40.920
 You say, why is the, you know, why does the Muon particle exist?

1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:43.920
 Why is it 206 times the mass of the electron?

1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:44.920
 We don't know.

1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:45.920
 No idea.

1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:54.920
 But so the standard model of physics is one of the models that's very accurate for describing three, three of the fundamental forces of physics.

1:06:54.920 --> 1:06:57.920
 And it's looking at the world of the very small.

1:06:57.920 --> 1:06:58.920
 Right.

1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:03.920
 And then there's back to the neighbor of gravity, of general relativity.

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:14.920
 So, and in the context of a theory of everything, what's traditionally the task of the unification of these theories?

1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:21.920
 Well, I mean, the issue is, you try to use the methods of quantum field theory to talk about gravity, and it doesn't work.

1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:23.920
 Just like there are photons of light.

1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:27.920
 So there are gravitons, which are sort of the particles of gravity.

1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:38.920
 And when you try and compute sort of the properties of the, of the particles of gravity, the kind of mathematical tricks that get used in working things out in quantum field theory don't work.

1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:56.920
 And that's, so that's been a sort of fundamental issue. And when you think about black holes, which are a place where sort of the, the structure of space is, you know, has, has sort of rapid variation and you get kind of quantum effects mixed in with effects from general

1:07:56.920 --> 1:08:11.920
 relativity, things get very complicated and there are apparent paradoxes and things like that. And people have, you know, there have been a bunch of mathematical developments in, in physics over the last, I don't know, 30 years or so, which have kind of picked away at those kinds of issues, and

1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:14.920
 got hints about how things might work.

1:08:14.920 --> 1:08:25.920
 And, but it hasn't been, you know, and the other thing to realize is, as far as physics is concerned, it's just like his general relativity, his quantum field theory, you know, be happy.

1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:39.920
 Professor, do you think there's a quantization of gravity to quantum gravity? What do you think of efforts that people have tried to? Yeah, what do you think in general of the efforts of the physics community to try to unify these laws?

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:45.920
 So I think what's, it's interesting. I mean, I would have said something very different before what's happened with our physics project.

1:08:45.920 --> 1:09:03.920
 I mean, you know, the remarkable thing is what we've been able to do is to make from this very simple, structurally simple underlying set of ideas, we've been able to build this, this, you know, very elaborate structure that's both very abstract,

1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:12.920
 and very sort of mathematically rich. And the big surprise as far as I'm concerned is that it touches many of the ideas that people have had.

1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:24.920
 So in other words, things like string theory and so on, twister theory, it's like the, you know, we might have thought I had thought we're out on a prong, we're building something that's computational, it's completely different from what other people have done.

1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:37.920
 But actually, it seems like what we've done is to provide essentially the machine code that, you know, these things are of various features of domain specific languages, so to speak, that talk about various aspects of this machine code.

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:53.920
 And I think there's a, this is something that to me is very exciting because it allows one both for us to provide sort of a new foundation for what's been thought about there, and for the all the work that's been done in those areas to, you know, to give us, you know,

1:09:53.920 --> 1:10:04.920
 more momentum to be able to figure out what's going on. Now, you know, people have sort of hoped, oh, we're just going to be able to get, you know, string theory to just answer everything that hasn't worked out.

1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:11.920
 And I think we now kind of can see a little bit about just sort of how far away certain kinds of things are from being able to explain things.

1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:22.920
 Some things, one of the big surprises to me, actually, I literally just got a message about one aspect of this is the, you know, it's turning out to be easier.

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:26.920
 I mean, this project has been so much easier than I could ever imagine it would be.

1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:37.920
 Because I thought we would be, you know, just about able to understand the first 10 to the minus 100 seconds of the universe. And, you know, it would be 100 years before we get much further than that.

1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:42.920
 It's just turned out it actually wasn't that hard. I mean, we're not finished, but, you know,

1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:47.920
 So you're, you're, you're seeing echoes of all the disparate theories of physics in this framework.

1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:53.920
 Yes. Yes. I mean, it's a very interesting, you know, sort of history of science like phenomenon.

1:10:53.920 --> 1:11:00.920
 The first analogy that I can see is what happened with the early, early days of, of computability and computation theory.

1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:03.920
 You know, Turing machines were invented in 1936.

1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:10.920
 People sort of understand computation in terms of Turing machines, but actually there had been preexisting theories of computation,

1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:14.920
 combinators, general recursive functions, lambda calculus, things like this.

1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:21.920
 But people hadn't, those hadn't been concrete enough that people could really wrap their arms around them and understand what was going on.

1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:27.920
 And I think what we're going to see in this case is that a bunch of these mathematical theories, including some very,

1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:35.920
 and one of the things that's really interesting is one of the most abstract things that's come out of, of sort of mathematics,

1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:39.920
 higher category theory, things about infinity group voids, things like this,

1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:45.920
 which to me always just seemed like they were floating off into the stratosphere ionosphere of mathematics,

1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:58.920
 turn out to be things which our sort of theory anchors down to something fairly definite and says are super relevant to the way that we can understand how physics works.

1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:00.920
 Give me a second. By the way, I just threw a hat on.

1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:08.920
 You've said that this metaphor analogy that theory of everything is a big mountain.

1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:24.920
 And you have a sense that however far we are up the mountain, that the Wolfram physics model of the universe is at least the right mountain.

1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:26.920
 We're the right mountain.

1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:27.920
 Yes, without question.

1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:30.920
 So which aspect of it is the right mountain?

1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:38.920
 So for example, I mean, so there's so many aspects to just the way of the Wolfram physics project, the way it approaches the world.

1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:45.920
 That's clean, crisp and unique and powerful.

1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:48.920
 So, you know, there's a discrete nature to it.

1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:50.920
 There's a hypergraph.

1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:52.920
 There's a computation nature.

1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:53.920
 There's a generative aspect.

1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:54.920
 You start from nothing.

1:12:54.920 --> 1:12:56.920
 You generate everything.

1:12:56.920 --> 1:13:01.920
 Do you think the actual model is actually a really good one?

1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:06.920
 Or do you think this general principle of from simplicity generating complexity is the right?

1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:08.920
 Like what aspect of the mountain?

1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:24.920
 I think that the kind of the meta idea about using simple computational systems to do things, that's, you know, that's the ultimate big paradigm that is, you know, sort of super important.

1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:30.920
 The details of the particular model are very nice and clean and allow one to actually understand what's going on.

1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:31.920
 They are not unique.

1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:33.920
 And in fact, we know that.

1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:38.920
 We know that there's a large number of different ways to describe essentially the same thing.

1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:40.920
 I mean, I can describe things in terms of hypergraphs.

1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:42.920
 I can describe them in terms of higher category theory.

1:13:42.920 --> 1:13:44.920
 I can describe them in a bunch of different ways.

1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:53.920
 They are in some sense all the same thing, but our sort of story about what's going on and the kind of cultural mathematical resonances are a bit different.

1:13:53.920 --> 1:14:03.920
 I think it's perhaps worth sort of saying a little bit about kind of the foundational ideas of these models and things.

1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:04.920
 Great.

1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:08.920
 So can we rewind?

1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:15.920
 We've talked about it a little bit, but can you say like what the central idea is of the Wolfram Physics Project?

1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:16.920
 Right.

1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:23.920
 So the question is we're interested in finding sort of simple computational rule that describes our whole universe.

1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:24.920
 Can we just pause on that?

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:25.920
 It's just so beautiful.

1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:42.920
 That's such a beautiful idea that we can generate our universe from a data structure, a simple set of rules, and we can generate our entire universe.

1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:43.920
 Yes.

1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:44.920
 That's all inspiring.

1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:45.920
 Right.

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:49.920
 But so the question is how do you actualize that?

1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:51.920
 What might this rule be like?

1:14:51.920 --> 1:15:03.920
 And so one thing you quickly realize is if you're going to pack everything about our universe into this tiny rule, not much that we are familiar with in our universe will be obvious in that rule.

1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:11.920
 So you don't get to fit all these parameters of the universe, all these features of, you know, this is how space works, this is how time works, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:21.920
 You don't get to fit that all in, it all has to be sort of packed in to this thing, something much smaller, much more basic, much lower level machine code, so to speak, than that.

1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:25.920
 And all the stuff that we're familiar with has to kind of emerge from the operation.

1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:31.920
 So the rule in itself because of the computational reducibility is not going to tell you the story.

1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:39.920
 It's not going to give you the answer to, it's not going to let you predict what you're going to have for lunch tomorrow.

1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:40.920
 Right.

1:15:40.920 --> 1:15:44.920
 It's not going to let you predict basically anything about your life, about the universe.

1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:45.920
 Right.

1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:50.920
 And you're not going to be able to see in that rule, oh, there's the three for the number of dimensions of space and so on.

1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:51.920
 Right.

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:52.920
 That's not going to be just...

1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:54.920
 Space time is not going to be obviously...

1:15:54.920 --> 1:15:55.920
 Right.

1:15:55.920 --> 1:15:57.920
 So the question is then what is the universe made of?

1:15:57.920 --> 1:15:59.920
 That's a basic question.

1:15:59.920 --> 1:16:08.920
 And we've had some assumptions about what the universe is made of for the last few thousand years that I think in some cases just turned out not to be right.

1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:13.920
 And the most important assumption is that space is a continuous thing.

1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:18.920
 That is that you can, if you say, let's pick a point in space.

1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:19.920
 We're going to do geometry.

1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:20.920
 We're going to pick a point.

1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:23.920
 We can pick a point absolutely anywhere in space.

1:16:23.920 --> 1:16:27.920
 Precise numbers we can specify of where that point is.

1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:37.920
 In fact, Euclid who kind of wrote down the original kind of axiomatization of geometry back in 300 BC or so, his very first definition, he says,

1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:39.920
 a point is that which has no part.

1:16:39.920 --> 1:16:46.920
 A point is this indivisible infinitesimal thing.

1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:49.920
 So we might have said that about material objects.

1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:51.920
 We might have said that about water, for example.

1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:58.920
 We might have said water is a continuous thing that we can just pick any point we want in some water.

1:16:58.920 --> 1:16:59.920
 But actually we know it isn't true.

1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:03.920
 We know that water is made of molecules that are discreet.

1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:07.920
 And so the question, one fundamental question is what is space made of?

1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:14.920
 And so one of the things that sort of a starting point for what I've done is to think of space as a discreet thing.

1:17:14.920 --> 1:17:22.920
 To think of there being sort of atoms of space, just as there are atoms of material things, although very different kinds of atoms.

1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:27.920
 And by the way, I mean, this idea, you know, there were ancient Greek philosophers who had this idea.

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:31.920
 There were, you know, Einstein actually thought this is probably how things would work out.

1:17:31.920 --> 1:17:35.920
 I mean, he said, you know, repeatedly, he thought that's where it would work out.

1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:41.920
 We don't have the mathematical tools in our time, which was 1940s, 1950s and so on, to explore this.

1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:51.920
 Like the way he thought, you mean that there is something very, very small and discreet that's underlying space?

1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:52.920
 Yes.

1:17:52.920 --> 1:18:00.920
 And that means that, so, you know, the mathematical theory, mathematical theories in physics assume that space can be described

1:18:00.920 --> 1:18:02.920
 just as a continuous thing.

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:05.920
 You can just pick coordinates and the coordinates can have any values.

1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:07.920
 And that's how you define space.

1:18:07.920 --> 1:18:12.920
 Space is just sort of background sort of theater on which the universe operates.

1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:22.920
 But can we draw a distinction between space as a thing that could be described by three values, coordinates,

1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:28.920
 and how you're, are you using the word space more generally when you say?

1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:33.920
 No, I'm just talking about space as what we experience in the universe.

1:18:33.920 --> 1:18:37.920
 So you think this 3D aspect of it is fundamental?

1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:40.920
 No, I don't think that 3D is fundamental at all, actually.

1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:50.920
 I think that the thing that has been assumed is that space is this continuous thing where you can just describe it by, let's say, three numbers, for instance.

1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:57.920
 But the most important thing about that is that you can describe it by precise numbers, because you can pick any point in space.

1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:00.920
 And you can talk about motions, any infinitesimal motion in space.

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:02.920
 And that's what continuous means.

1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:03.920
 That's what continuous means.

1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:08.920
 That's what, you know, Newton invented calculus to describe these kind of continuous small variations and so on.

1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:11.920
 That was, that's kind of a fundamental idea from Euclid on.

1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:14.920
 That's been a fundamental idea about space.

1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:17.920
 Is that right or wrong?

1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:20.920
 It's not right. It's not right.

1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:24.920
 It's right at the level of our experience most of the time.

1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:28.920
 It's not right at the level of the machine code, so to speak.

1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:30.920
 Machine code?

1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:32.920
 Yeah, of the simulation. That's right. That's right.

1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:43.920
 The very lowest level of the fabric of the universe, at least under the Wolfram physics model, is your senses discreet?

1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:45.920
 Right. So now, what does that mean?

1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:48.920
 So it means what is space then?

1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:55.920
 So in models, the basic idea is you say there are these sort of atoms of space.

1:19:55.920 --> 1:20:01.920
 They're these points that represent, you know, represent places in space.

1:20:01.920 --> 1:20:03.920
 But they're just discrete points.

1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:07.920
 And the only thing we know about them is how they're connected to each other.

1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:09.920
 We don't know where they are. They don't have coordinates.

1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:12.920
 We don't get to say this is a position such and such.

1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:14.920
 It's just, here's a big bag of points.

1:20:14.920 --> 1:20:17.920
 Like in our universe, there might be 10 to the 100 of these points.

1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:21.920
 And all we know is this point is connected to this other point.

1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:24.920
 So it's like, you know, all we have is the friend network, so to speak.

1:20:24.920 --> 1:20:28.920
 We don't have, you know, people's physical addresses.

1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:30.920
 All we have is the friend network of these points.

1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:34.920
 Yeah. The underlying nature of reality is kind of like a Facebook.

1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:36.920
 We don't know their location, but we have the friends.

1:20:36.920 --> 1:20:40.920
 Yeah, right. We know which point is connected to which other points.

1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:42.920
 And that's all we know.

1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:47.920
 And so you might say, well, how on earth can you get something which is like our experience

1:20:47.920 --> 1:20:49.920
 of, you know, what seems like continuous space?

1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:53.920
 Well, the answer is by the time you have 10 to the 100 of these things,

1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:58.920
 those connections can work in such a way that on a large scale,

1:20:58.920 --> 1:21:02.920
 it will seem to be like continuous space in, let's say, three dimensions

1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:06.920
 or some other number of dimensions or 2.6 dimensions or whatever else.

1:21:06.920 --> 1:21:09.920
 Because they're much, much, much, much larger.

1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:15.920
 So like the number of relationships here we're talking about is just a humongous amount.

1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:21.920
 So the kind of thing you're talking about is very, very, very small relative to our experience of daily life.

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:24.920
 Right. So, I mean, you know, we don't know exactly the size,

1:21:24.920 --> 1:21:31.920
 but maybe 10 to the minus, maybe around 10 to the minus 100 meters.

1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:37.920
 So, you know, the size of, to give a comparison, the size of a proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters.

1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:41.920
 And so this is something incredibly tiny compared to that.

1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:49.920
 And the idea that from that would emerge the experience of continuous space is mind blowing.

1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:52.920
 Well, what's your intuition? Why that's possible?

1:21:52.920 --> 1:22:00.920
 Like, first of all, I mean, we'll get into it, but I don't know if we will through the medium of conversation,

1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:05.920
 but the construct of hypergraphs is just beautiful.

1:22:05.920 --> 1:22:06.920
 Right.

1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:08.920
 Tell you're a domino or beautiful. We'll talk about it.

1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:16.920
 But this thing about, you know, continuity arising from discrete systems is in today's world is actually not so surprising.

1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:18.920
 I mean, you know, your average computer screen, right?

1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:21.920
 Every computer screen is made of discrete pixels.

1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:26.920
 Yet we have the, you know, we have the idea that we're seeing these continuous pictures.

1:22:26.920 --> 1:22:32.920
 I mean, it's, you know, the fact that on a large scale, continuity can arise from lots of discrete elements.

1:22:32.920 --> 1:22:35.920
 This is at some level unsurprising now.

1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:45.920
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. But the pixels have a very definitive structure of neighbors on a computer screen.

1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:46.920
 Right.

1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:55.920
 There's no concept of spatial, of space inherent in the underlying fabric of reality.

1:22:55.920 --> 1:22:59.920
 Right, right, right. So the point is, but there are cases where there are.

1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:02.920
 So for example, let's just imagine you have a square grid.

1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:06.920
 Okay. And at every point on the grid, you have one of these atoms of space.

1:23:06.920 --> 1:23:13.920
 And it's connected to four other, four other atoms of space on the, you know, northeast, southwest corners, right?

1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:18.920
 There you have something where if you zoom out from that, it's like a computer screen.

1:23:18.920 --> 1:23:22.920
 Yeah. So the relationship creates the spatial.

1:23:22.920 --> 1:23:23.920
 Right.

1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:37.920
 The relationship creates a constraint, which then in an emergent sense creates a, like, yeah, like a, basically a spatial coordinate for that thing.

1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:38.920
 Yeah, right.

1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:40.920
 Even though the individual point doesn't have a spatial.

1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:44.920
 Even though the individual point doesn't know anything, it just knows what it's, you know, what its neighbors are.

1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:53.920
 Basically on a large scale, it can be described by saying, oh, it looks like it's a, you know, this grid is zoomed out grid.

1:23:53.920 --> 1:23:58.920
 You can say, well, you can describe these different points by saying they have certain positions, coordinates, et cetera.

1:23:58.920 --> 1:24:01.920
 Now, in the, in the sort of real setup, it's more complicated than that.

1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:03.920
 It isn't just a square grid or something.

1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:07.920
 It's something much more dynamic and complicated, which we'll talk about.

1:24:07.920 --> 1:24:16.920
 So, you know, first, the first idea, the first key idea is, you know, what's the universe made of, it's made of atoms of space, basically, with these connections between them.

1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:18.920
 What kind of connections do they have?

1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:32.920
 Well, so a, the simplest kind of thing you might say is we've got something like a graph where every, every atom of space where we have these edges that go between out of these connections that go between atoms of space.

1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:38.920
 We're not saying how long these edges are, we're just saying there is a connection from, from this place to the, from this atom to this atom.

1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:43.920
 Just a quick pause, because there's a lot of varied people that listen to this.

1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:48.920
 Just to clarify, because I did a poll actually, what do you think a graph is a long time ago?

1:24:48.920 --> 1:24:55.920
 And it's kind of funny how few people know the term graph outside of computer science.

1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:56.920
 Let's call it a network.

1:24:56.920 --> 1:24:58.920
 I think that's called a network is better.

1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:14.920
 But every time I like the word graph though, so let's define, let's just say that a graph will use terms nodes and edges, maybe, and it's just nodes represent some abstract entity, and then the edges represent relationships between those entities.

1:25:14.920 --> 1:25:15.920
 Right, exactly.

1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:16.920
 So that's what graphs.

1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:17.920
 Sorry.

1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:18.920
 So there you go.

1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:20.920
 So that's the basic structure.

1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:22.920
 That is, that is the simplest case of a basic structure.

1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:28.920
 Actually, it tends to be better to think about hypergraphs.

1:25:28.920 --> 1:25:36.920
 So a hypergraph is just instead of saying there are connections between pairs of things, we say there are connections between any number of things.

1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:38.920
 So there might be ternary edges.

1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:49.920
 So instead of, instead of just having two points are connected by an edge, you say three points are all associated with a hyper edge are all connected by a hyper edge.

1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:53.920
 That's just at some level, that's, at some level, that's a detail.

1:25:53.920 --> 1:26:07.920
 It's a detail that happens to make the, for me, you know, sort of in the history of this project, the realization that you could do things that way broke out of certain kinds of arbitrariness that I felt that there was in the model before I had seen how this worked.

1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:11.920
 I mean, all a hypergraph can be mapped to a graph.

1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:14.920
 It's just a convenient representation, mathematical.

1:26:14.920 --> 1:26:15.920
 Right.

1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:16.920
 That's correct.

1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:17.920
 That's correct.

1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:26.920
 So, okay, so the, the first question, the first idea of these models of ours is space is made of these, you know, connected sort of atoms of space.

1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:29.920
 The next idea is space is all there is.

1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:31.920
 There's nothing except for this space.

1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:36.920
 So in traditional ideas in physics, people have said there's space, it's kind of a background.

1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:42.920
 And then there's matter, all these particles, electrons, all these other things, which exist in space.

1:26:42.920 --> 1:26:47.920
 But in this model, one of the key ideas is there's nothing except space.

1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:53.920
 So in other words, everything that has that exists in the universe is a feature of this hypergraph.

1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:55.920
 So how can that possibly be?

1:26:55.920 --> 1:27:04.920
 Well, the way that works is that there are certain structures in this hypergraph where you say that little twisty knotted thing.

1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:10.920
 We don't know exactly how this works yet, but we have sort of idea about how it works mathematically.

1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:14.920
 This sort of twisted knotted thing, that's the core of an electron.

1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:18.920
 This thing over there that has this different form, that's something else.

1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:28.920
 So the different peculiarities of the structure of this graph are the very things that we think of as the particles inside the space,

1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:31.920
 but in fact, it's just the property of the space.

1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:34.920
 Mind blowing, first of all, that it's mind blowing.

1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:37.920
 And we'll probably talk in its simplicity and beauty.

1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:39.920
 Yes, I think it's very beautiful.

1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:45.920
 But that's space, and then there's another concept we didn't really kind of mention,

1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:49.920
 but you think it of computation as like a transformation.

1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:51.920
 Let's talk about time in a second.

1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:57.920
 Let's just, I mean, on the subject of space, there's this question of kind of what, there's this idea,

1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:02.920
 there is this hypergraph, it represents space and it represents everything that's in space.

1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:07.920
 The features of that hypergraph, you can say certain features in this part we do know,

1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:11.920
 certain features of the hypergraph represent the presence of energy, for example,

1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:13.920
 or the presence of mass or momentum.

1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:17.920
 And we know what the features of the hypergraph that represent those things are,

1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:19.920
 but it's all just the same hypergraph.

1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:23.920
 So one thing you might ask is, you know, if you just look at this hypergraph and you say,

1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:26.920
 and we're going to talk about sort of what the hypergraph does,

1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:33.920
 but if you say, you know, how much of what's going on in this hypergraph is things we know and care about,

1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:40.920
 like particles and atoms of electrons and all this kind of thing, and how much is just the background of space.

1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:44.920
 So it turns out, so far as in one rough estimate of this,

1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:51.920
 or everything that we care about in the universe is only one part and 10 to the 120 of what's actually going on.

1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:56.920
 The vast majority of what's happening is purely things that maintain the structure of space.

1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:03.920
 In other words, the things that are the features of space that are the things that we consider notable,

1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:09.920
 like the presence of particles and so on, that's a tiny little piece of froth on the top of all this activity

1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:14.920
 that mostly is just intended to, you know, mostly it can't say intended.

1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:18.920
 There's no intention here that just maintains the structure of space.

1:29:18.920 --> 1:29:26.920
 Let me load that in. It just makes me feel so good as a human being.

1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:32.920
 To be the froth on the one in the 10 to the 120 or something.

1:29:32.920 --> 1:29:44.920
 And also just humbling how in this mathematical framework, how much work needs to be done on the infrastructure of our universe.

1:29:44.920 --> 1:29:47.920
 Right. To maintain the infrastructure of our universe is a lot of work.

1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:52.920
 We are merely writing a little tiny things on top of that infrastructure.

1:29:52.920 --> 1:29:58.920
 But you were just starting to talk a little bit about space.

1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:02.920
 That represents all the stuff that's in the universe.

1:30:02.920 --> 1:30:05.920
 The question is, what does that stuff do?

1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:10.920
 And for that, we have to start talking about time and what is time and so on.

1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:17.920
 And, you know, one of the basic idea of this model is time is the progression of computation.

1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:24.920
 So in other words, we have a structure of space and there is a rule that says how that structure of space will change.

1:30:24.920 --> 1:30:31.920
 And it's the application, the repeated application of that rule that defines the progress of time.

1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:35.920
 Then what does the rule look like in the space of hypergraphs?

1:30:35.920 --> 1:30:41.920
 Right. So what the rule says is something like if you have a little tiny piece of hypergraph that looks like this,

1:30:41.920 --> 1:30:45.920
 then it will be transformed into a piece of hypergraph that looks like this.

1:30:45.920 --> 1:30:47.920
 So that's all it says.

1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:50.920
 It says you pick up these elements of space.

1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:56.920
 And you can think of these edges, these hyper edges as being relations between elements in space.

1:30:56.920 --> 1:31:02.920
 You might pick up these two relations between elements in space.

1:31:02.920 --> 1:31:08.920
 And we're not saying where those elements are or what they are, but every time there's a certain arrangement of elements in space,

1:31:08.920 --> 1:31:14.920
 then arrangement in the sense of the way they're connected, then we transform it into some other arrangement.

1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:17.920
 So there's a little tiny pattern and you transform it into another little pattern.

1:31:17.920 --> 1:31:18.920
 That's right.

1:31:18.920 --> 1:31:26.920
 And then because of this, I mean, again, it's kind of similar to cellular automata in that, like, on paper, the rule looks like super simple.

1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:33.920
 It's like, yeah, okay. Yeah, right. From this, the universe can be born.

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:40.920
 But like, once you start applying it, beautiful structure starts being potentially can be created.

1:31:40.920 --> 1:31:48.920
 And what you're doing is you're applying that rule to different parts, like any time you match it within the hypergraph.

1:31:48.920 --> 1:31:49.920
 Exactly.

1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:58.920
 And one of the, like, incredibly beautiful and interesting things to think about is the order in which you apply that rule.

1:31:58.920 --> 1:31:59.920
 Yes.

1:31:59.920 --> 1:32:01.920
 Because that pattern appears all over the place.

1:32:01.920 --> 1:32:02.920
 Right.

1:32:02.920 --> 1:32:05.920
 So this is a big, complicated thing, very hard to wrap one's brain around.

1:32:05.920 --> 1:32:06.920
 Okay.

1:32:06.920 --> 1:32:11.920
 So you say the rule is every time you see this little pattern, transform it in this way.

1:32:11.920 --> 1:32:18.920
 But yet, you know, as you look around the space that represents the universe, there may be zillions of places where that little pattern occurs.

1:32:18.920 --> 1:32:19.920
 Yeah.

1:32:19.920 --> 1:32:25.920
 So what it says is just do this, apply this rule wherever you feel like.

1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:34.920
 And what is extremely non trivial is, well, okay, so this is happening sort of in computer science terms sort of asynchronously.

1:32:34.920 --> 1:32:37.920
 You're just doing it wherever you feel like doing it.

1:32:37.920 --> 1:32:45.920
 And the only constraint is that if you're going to apply the rule somewhere, the things to which you apply the rule,

1:32:45.920 --> 1:32:53.920
 the little, you know, elements to which you apply the rule, if they have to be, okay,

1:32:53.920 --> 1:32:58.920
 well, you can think of each application of the rule as being kind of an event that happens in the universe.

1:32:58.920 --> 1:32:59.920
 Yep.

1:32:59.920 --> 1:33:05.920
 And the input to an event has to be ready for the event to occur.

1:33:05.920 --> 1:33:11.920
 That is, if one event occurred, if one transformation occurred, and it produced a particular atom of space,

1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:22.920
 then that atom of space has to already exist before another transformation that's going to apply to that atom of space can occur.

1:33:22.920 --> 1:33:23.920
 Yeah.

1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:25.920
 So that's like the prerequisite for the event.

1:33:25.920 --> 1:33:26.920
 That's right.

1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:27.920
 That's right.

1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:33.920
 So that defines a kind of this sort of set of causal relationships between events.

1:33:33.920 --> 1:33:37.920
 It says this event has to happen before this event.

1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:39.920
 But that is.

1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:42.920
 But that's not a very limited constraint.

1:33:42.920 --> 1:33:43.920
 No, it's not.

1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:44.920
 And what's interesting.

1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:49.920
 You still get the zillion, that's the technical term, options.

1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:50.920
 That's correct.

1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:53.920
 But okay, so this is where things get a little bit more elaborate.

1:33:53.920 --> 1:33:55.920
 But they're mind blowing.

1:33:55.920 --> 1:33:56.920
 Right.

1:33:56.920 --> 1:34:02.920
 So what happens is, so the first thing you might say is, you know, let's, well, okay,

1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:06.920
 so this question about the freedom of which event you do when.

1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:09.920
 Well, let me, let me sort of state an answer and then explain it.

1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:10.920
 Okay.

1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:24.920
 The validity of special relativity is a consequence of the fact that in some sense it doesn't matter in what order you do these underlying things so long as they respect this kind of set of causal relationships.

1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:36.920
 And that's, that's in the part that's in a certain sense is a really important one but the fact that it sometimes doesn't matter.

1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:38.920
 That's a, I don't know, that's another like beautiful thing.

1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:41.920
 Okay, so there's this idea of what I call causal invariance.

1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:43.920
 Causal invariance, exactly.

1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:46.920
 So that's a really, really powerful, powerful idea.

1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:55.920
 Which has actually arisen in different forms many times in the history of mathematics, mathematical logic, even computer science has many different names.

1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:00.920
 I mean, our particular version of it is a little bit tighter than other versions, but it's basically the same idea.

1:35:00.920 --> 1:35:02.920
 Here's, here's how to think about that idea.

1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:07.920
 So imagine that, well, let's talk about it in terms of math for a second.

1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:15.920
 Let's say you're doing algebra and you're told, you know, multiply out this series of polynomials that are, that are multiplied together.

1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:18.920
 Okay, you say, well, which order should I do that in?

1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:22.920
 Say, well, do I multiply the third one by the fourth one and then do it by the first one?

1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:25.920
 Or do I do the fifth one by the sixth one and then do that?

1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:27.920
 Well, it turns out it doesn't matter.

1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:29.920
 You can, you can multiply them out in any order.

1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:31.920
 You'll always get the same answer.

1:35:31.920 --> 1:35:33.920
 That's a, that's a property.

1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:44.920
 If you think about kind of making a kind of network that represents in what order you do things, you'll get different orders for different ways of multiplying things out, but you'll always get the same answer.

1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:52.920
 Same thing if you, let's say you're sorting, you've got a bunch of A's and B's, then random, some random order, you know, B, A, A, B, B, B, A, A, A, whatever.

1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:58.920
 And you have a little rule that says, every time you see B, A, flip it around to A, B.

1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:06.920
 Okay, eventually you apply that rule enough times, you'll have sorted the string so that it's all the A's first and then all the B's.

1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:14.920
 Again, you, there are many different orders in which you can do that, that many different sort of places where you can apply that update.

1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:17.920
 In the end, you'll always get the string sorted the same way.

1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:21.920
 I know, I know with sorting the string, it sounds obvious.

1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:35.920
 That's to me surprising that, that there is in complicated systems, obviously with the string, but in the hypergraph that the application of the rule, asynchronous rule can lead to the same results sometimes.

1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:38.920
 Yes, yes, that is, it is not obvious.

1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:44.920
 And it was something that, you know, I sort of discovered that idea for these kinds of systems in back in the 1990s.

1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:53.920
 And for various reasons, I was not satisfied by how sort of fragile finding that particular property was.

1:36:53.920 --> 1:37:02.920
 And let me just make another point, which is that it turns out that even if the underlying rule does not have this property of causal invariance,

1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:12.920
 it can turn out that every observation made by observers of the rule can, they can impose what amounts to causal invariance on the rule.

1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:13.920
 We can explain that.

1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:14.920
 It's a little bit more complicated.

1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:22.920
 I mean, technically that has to do with this idea of completions, which is something that comes up in term rewriting systems, automated theorem proving systems and so on.

1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:25.920
 But that, let's ignore that for a second.

1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:26.920
 We can come to that later.

1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:28.920
 Is it useful to talk about observation?

1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:29.920
 Not yet.

1:37:29.920 --> 1:37:30.920
 Not yet.

1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:31.920
 Okay.

1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:32.920
 So great.

1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:38.920
 So there's some concept of causal invariance as you apply these rules in an asynchronous way.

1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:41.920
 You can think of those transformations as events.

1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:49.920
 So there's this hypergraph that represents space and all of these events happening in the space and the graph grows in interesting, complicated ways.

1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:55.920
 And eventually the froth arises of what we experience as human existence.

1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:00.920
 That's some version of the picture, but let's explain a little bit more.

1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:01.920
 Exactly.

1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:03.920
 What's a little more detail?

1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:04.920
 Right.

1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:13.920
 So one thing that is sort of surprising in this theory is one of the sort of achievements of 20th century physics was kind of bringing space and time together.

1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:15.920
 That was, you know, special relativity.

1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:29.920
 People talk about space time, this sort of unified thing where space and time kind of a mixed and there's a nice mathematical formalism that in which, you know, space and time sort of appear as part of the space time continuum.

1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:33.920
 The space time, you know, four vectors and things like this.

1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:37.920
 You know, we talk about time as the fourth dimension and all these kinds of things.

1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:44.920
 It's, you know, and it seems like the theory relativity sort of says space and time are fundamentally the same kind of thing.

1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:56.920
 So one of the things that took a while to understand in this approach of mine is that in my kind of approach, space and time are really not fundamentally the same kind of thing.

1:38:56.920 --> 1:38:59.920
 Space is the extension of this hypergraph.

1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:06.920
 Time is the kind of progress of this inexorable computation of these rules getting applied to the hypergraph.

1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:09.920
 So they seem like very different kinds of things.

1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:13.920
 And so that at first seems like how can that possibly be right?

1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:15.920
 How can that possibly be Lorentz invariant?

1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:20.920
 That's the term for things being, you know, following the rules of special relativity.

1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:30.920
 Well, it turns out that when you have causal invariance that, and let's see, we can, it's worth, it's worth explaining a little bit how this works.

1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:32.920
 It's a little bit, a little bit elaborate.

1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:49.920
 But the basic point is that the, even though space and time sort of come from very different places, it turns out that the rules of sort of space time that special relativity talks about come out of this model.

1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:52.920
 When you're looking at large enough systems.

1:39:52.920 --> 1:40:07.920
 So, so a way to think about this, you know, in terms of the, when you're looking at large enough systems, the part of that story is when you look at some fluid like water, for example, there are equations that govern the flow of water.

1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:11.920
 Those equations are things that apply on a large scale.

1:40:11.920 --> 1:40:15.920
 If you look at the individual molecules, they don't know anything about those equations.

1:40:15.920 --> 1:40:21.920
 It's just the, the, the sort of the large scale effect of those molecules turns out to follow those equations.

1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:24.920
 And it's the same kind of thing happening in our models.

1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:28.920
 I know this might be a small point, but maybe a very big one.

1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:38.920
 We've been talking about space and time at the lowest level of the model, which is space, the hypergraph time is the evolution of this hypergraph.

1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:46.920
 But there's also space time that we think about in general relativity for your special relativity.

1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:57.920
 Like what, how does, how do you go from the lowest source code of space and times we're talking about to the more traditional terminology of space and time?

1:40:57.920 --> 1:40:58.920
 Yeah, right.

1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:00.920
 So the key thing is this thing we call the causal graph.

1:41:00.920 --> 1:41:05.920
 So the causal graph is the graph of causal relationships between events.

1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:15.920
 So every one of these little updating events, every one of these little transformations of the hypergraph happens somewhere in the hypergraph happens at some stage in the computation.

1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:17.920
 That's an event.

1:41:17.920 --> 1:41:34.920
 That event is, has a causal relationship to other events in the sense that if the, if another event needs as its input, the output from the first event, there will be a causal relationship of the, the, the future event will depend on the past event.

1:41:34.920 --> 1:41:37.920
 So you can say it's, it has a causal connection.

1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:41.920
 So you can make this graph of causal relationships between events.

1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:46.920
 That graph of causal relationships, causal invariance implies that that graph is unique.

1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:48.920
 It doesn't matter.

1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:57.920
 Even though you think, oh, I'm, I'm, you know, let's say we were sorting a string, for example, I did that particular transposition of characters at this time.

1:41:57.920 --> 1:41:58.920
 And then I did that one.

1:41:58.920 --> 1:41:59.920
 Then I did this one.

1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:06.920
 Turns out if you look at the network of, of connections between those updating events, that network is the same.

1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:10.920
 It's, it's the, if, if you were to, the, the, the structure.

1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:20.920
 So in other words, if you were to draw that, that, if you were to put that network on a picture of where you're doing all the updating, the places where you put the, the nodes of the network will be different.

1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:23.920
 But the way the nodes are connected will always be the same.

1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:30.920
 So the causal graph is a, is, I don't know, it's kind of an observation. It's not enforced.

1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:32.920
 It's just emergent from a set of events.

1:42:32.920 --> 1:42:35.920
 Well, it's a, it's a feature of, of, of, okay.

1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:36.920
 So what it is.

1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:38.920
 The characteristic, I guess, is the way events happen.

1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:39.920
 Right.

1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:41.920
 It's an event can't happen until its input is ready.

1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:42.920
 Right.

1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:45.920
 And so that creates this, this network of causal relationships.

1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:47.920
 And that's, that's the causal graph.

1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:52.920
 And the thing that the next thing to realize is, okay, we, when you're going to look at,

1:42:52.920 --> 1:42:57.920
 when you're going to observe what happens in the universe, you have to sort of make sense

1:42:57.920 --> 1:42:58.920
 of this causal graph.

1:42:58.920 --> 1:43:04.920
 So, and you are an observer who yourself is part of this causal graph.

1:43:04.920 --> 1:43:07.920
 And so that means, so let me give you an example of how that works.

1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:12.920
 So, so imagine we have a really weird theory of physics of the world where it says this

1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:17.920
 updating process, there's only going to be one updated every moment in time.

1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:19.920
 And there's just going to be like a Turing machine.

1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:23.920
 A little head that runs around and just is always just updating one thing at a time.

1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:27.920
 So you say, you know, I have a theory of physics and the theory of physics says there's just

1:43:27.920 --> 1:43:29.920
 this one little place where things get updated.

1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:34.920
 You say, that's completely crazy because, you know, it's plainly obvious that things are

1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:37.920
 being updated sort of, you know, at the same time.

1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:43.920
 But, but, but the fact is that the thing is that if I'm, you know, talking to you and

1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:47.920
 you seem to be being updated as I'm being updated, but, but if there's just this one

1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:51.920
 little head that's running around updating things, I will not know whether you've been

1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:54.920
 updated or not until I'm updated.

1:43:54.920 --> 1:43:59.920
 So in other words, when you draw this causal graph of the causal relationship between the

1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:03.920
 updating and you and the updating and me, it'll still be the same causal graph, whether

1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:08.920
 even though the underlying sort of story of what happens is, oh, there's just this one

1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:11.920
 little thing and it goes and updates in different places in the universe.

1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:16.920
 So is that, is that clear or is that a hypothesis?

1:44:16.920 --> 1:44:20.920
 Is that, is that clear that there's a unique causal graph?

1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:23.920
 If there's causal invariance, there's a unique causal graph.

1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:29.920
 So we, so it's okay to think of what we're talking about as a hyper graph and the operations

1:44:29.920 --> 1:44:33.920
 on it as a kind of a touring machine with a single head, like a single guy running around

1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:35.920
 updating stuff.

1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:39.920
 Is that safe to intuitively think of it this way?

1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:41.920
 Let me think about that for a second.

1:44:41.920 --> 1:44:42.920
 Yes, I think so.

1:44:42.920 --> 1:44:44.920
 I think that, I think there's nothing, it doesn't matter.

1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:51.920
 I mean, you can say, okay, there is one, the reason I'm pausing for a second is that I'm

1:44:51.920 --> 1:44:57.920
 wondering, well, when you say running around depends how far it jumps every time it runs.

1:44:57.920 --> 1:44:58.920
 Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:01.920
 But I mean like one operation at a time.

1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:03.920
 Yeah, you can think of it as one operation at a time.

1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:08.920
 It's easier for the human brain to think of it that way as opposed to simultaneously.

1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:12.920
 Well, maybe it's not, okay, but the thing is that's not how we experience the world.

1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:18.920
 What we experience is we look around, everything seems to be happening at successive moments

1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:20.920
 in time, everywhere in space.

1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:21.920
 Yes.

1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:24.920
 That is the, and that's partly a feature of our particular construction.

1:45:24.920 --> 1:45:29.920
 I mean, that is the speed of light is really fast compared to, you know, we look around,

1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:32.920
 you know, I can see maybe a hundred feet away right now.

1:45:32.920 --> 1:45:39.920
 You know, it's the, my brain does not process very much in the time it takes light to

1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:43.920
 cover a hundred feet. The brain operates at a scale of hundreds of milliseconds or

1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:44.920
 something like that.

1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:45.920
 I don't know.

1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:46.920
 Right.

1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:47.920
 And speed of light is much faster.

1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:48.920
 Right.

1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:50.920
 You know, light goes in a billionth of a second, light has gone a foot.

1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:53.920
 So it goes a billion feet every second.

1:45:53.920 --> 1:46:00.920
 There's certain moments through this conversation where I imagine the absurdity of the fact that

1:46:00.920 --> 1:46:05.920
 there's two descendants of apes modeled by a hypograph that are communicating with each

1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:12.920
 other and experiencing this whole thing as a real time simultaneous update with, I'm

1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:17.920
 taking in photons from you right now, but there's something much, much deeper going on

1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:18.920
 here.

1:46:18.920 --> 1:46:19.920
 Right.

1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:20.920
 It does have a...

1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:21.920
 It's paralyzing sometimes to just...

1:46:21.920 --> 1:46:22.920
 Yes.

1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:23.920
 To remember that.

1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:24.920
 Right.

1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:25.920
 No, I mean, you know...

1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:26.920
 Sorry.

1:46:26.920 --> 1:46:27.920
 Yes, yes.

1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:33.920
 As a small little tangent, I just remembered that we're talking about, I mean, this, about

1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:36.920
 the fabric of reality.

1:46:36.920 --> 1:46:37.920
 Right.

1:46:37.920 --> 1:46:42.120
 So we've got this causal graph that represents the sort of causal relationships between all

1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:43.920
 these events in the universe.

1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:50.680
 That causal graph kind of is a representation of space time, but our experience of it requires

1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:53.040
 that we pick reference frames.

1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:54.160
 This is kind of a key idea.

1:46:54.160 --> 1:47:01.000
 Einstein had this idea that what that means is we have to say, what are we going to pick

1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:07.800
 as being the sort of what we define as simultaneous moments in time?

1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:12.680
 So for example, we can say, how do we set our clocks?

1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:18.200
 If we've got a spacecraft landing on Mars, do we say that...

1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:19.600
 What time is it landing at?

1:47:19.600 --> 1:47:20.600
 Was it...

1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:24.760
 Even though there's a 20 minute speed of light delay or something, what time do we say it

1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:25.760
 landed at?

1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:30.120
 How do we set up sort of time coordinates for the world?

1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:34.520
 And that turns out to be that there's kind of this arbitrariness to how we set these

1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:39.400
 reference frames that define sort of what counts as simultaneous.

1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:44.360
 And what is the essence of special relativity is to think about reference frames going at

1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:49.920
 different speeds and to think about sort of how they assign what counts as space, what

1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:52.520
 counts as time and so on.

1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:57.880
 That's all a bit technical, but the basic bottom line is that this causal invariance

1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:02.920
 property that means that it's always the same causal graph, independent of how you slice

1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:07.040
 it with these reference frames, you'll always sort of see the same physical processes go

1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:08.040
 on.

1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:10.440
 And that's basically why special relativity works.

1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:19.520
 So there's something like special relativity, like everything around space and time that

1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:22.600
 fits this idea of the causal graph.

1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:23.600
 Right.

1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:27.640
 Well, one way to think about it is given that you have a basic structure that just

1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:34.160
 involves updating things in these connected updates and looking at the causal relationships

1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:40.040
 from connected updates, that's enough when you unravel the consequences of that.

1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:42.680
 That together with the fact that there are lots of these things and that you can take

1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:47.120
 a continuum limit and so on, implies special relativity.

1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:55.080
 And so that, it's kind of a big deal because it's kind of a, it was completely unobvious

1:48:55.080 --> 1:48:59.440
 when you started off with saying, we've got this graph, it's being updated in time, et

1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:03.400
 cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that just looks like nothing to do with special relativity.

1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:05.520
 And yet you get that.

1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:09.960
 And what, I mean, then the thing, I mean, this was stuff that I figured out back in

1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:16.360
 the 1990s, the next big thing you get is general relativity.

1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:22.520
 And so in this hypergraph, the sort of limiting structure, when you have a very big hypergraph,

1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:27.160
 you can think of as being just like, water seems continuous on a large scale.

1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:30.280
 So this hypergraph seems continuous on a large scale.

1:49:30.280 --> 1:49:35.320
 One question is, how many dimensions of space does it correspond to?

1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:38.600
 So one question you can ask is if you've just got a bunch of points and they're connected

1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:45.000
 together, how do you deduce what effective dimension of space that bundle of points corresponds

1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:46.120
 to?

1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:47.800
 And that's pretty easy to explain.

1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:52.520
 So basically, if you say, you've got a point and you look at how many neighbors does that

1:49:52.520 --> 1:49:53.520
 point have?

1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:56.320
 Imagine it's on a square grid, then it'll have four neighbors.

1:49:56.320 --> 1:50:00.080
 Go another level out, how many neighbors do you get then?

1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:04.320
 What you realize is, as you go more and more levels out, as you go more and more distance

1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:10.600
 on the graph out, you're capturing something which is essentially a circle in two dimensions

1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:14.760
 so that the area of a circle is pi r squared.

1:50:14.760 --> 1:50:21.680
 So the number of points that you get to goes up like the distance you've gone squared.

1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:26.040
 And in general, in d dimensional space, it's r to the power d.

1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:32.920
 It's the number of points you get to if you go r steps on the graph, grows like the number

1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:35.640
 of steps you go to the power of the dimension.

1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:40.040
 And that's a way that you can estimate the effective dimension of one of these graphs.

1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:41.040
 So what does that grow to?

1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:42.640
 So how does the dimension grow?

1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:48.440
 Because, I mean, obviously, the visual aspect of these hypergraphs, they're often visualized

1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:50.400
 in three dimensions.

1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:59.520
 And then there's a certain kind of structure, like you said, there's a sphere, there's a

1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:06.880
 planar aspect to it, to this graph, to where it kind of almost starts creating a surface,

1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:09.240
 like a complicated surface, but a surface.

1:51:09.240 --> 1:51:12.240
 So how does that connect to effective dimension?

1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:13.240
 I was supposed to think about that.

1:51:13.240 --> 1:51:20.080
 I mean, if you can lay out the graph in such a way that the points in the graph that are

1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:25.840
 neighbors on the graph are neighbors as you lay them out, and you can do that in two dimensions,

1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:28.440
 then it's going to approximate a two dimensional thing.

1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:31.240
 If you can't do that in two dimensions, if everything would have to fold over a lot in

1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:34.240
 two dimensions, then it's not approximating a two dimensional thing.

1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:36.360
 Maybe you can lay it out in three dimensions.

1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:40.520
 Maybe you have to lay it out in five dimensions to have it be the case that it sort of smoothly

1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:41.720
 lays out like that.

1:51:41.720 --> 1:51:47.360
 Well, but okay, so I apologize for the different tangent questions, but you know, there's an

1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:51.480
 infinity number of possible rules.

1:51:51.480 --> 1:52:01.880
 So we have to look for rules that create the kind of structures that are reminiscent for,

1:52:01.880 --> 1:52:05.180
 that have echoes of the different physics theories in them.

1:52:05.180 --> 1:52:09.880
 So what kind of rules, is there something simple to be said about the kind of rules

1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:14.120
 that you have found beautiful, that you have found powerful?

1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:20.960
 So I mean, one of the features of computational reducibility is it's very, you can't say in

1:52:20.960 --> 1:52:25.880
 advance what's going to happen with any particular, you can't say, I'm going to pick these rules

1:52:25.880 --> 1:52:29.840
 from this part of rule space, so to speak, because they're going to be the ones that

1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:31.320
 are going to work.

1:52:31.320 --> 1:52:35.320
 You can make some statements along those lines, but you can't generally say that.

1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:39.800
 Now, you know, the state of what we've been able to do is, you know, different properties

1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:45.720
 of the universe, like dimensionality, you know, integer dimensionality, features of

1:52:45.720 --> 1:52:48.800
 other features of quantum mechanics, things like that.

1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:55.480
 At this point, what we've got is we've got rules that any one of those features, we can

1:52:55.480 --> 1:53:01.160
 get a rule that has that feature, but we don't have the sort of the final, here's a rule

1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:03.800
 which has all of these features, we do not have that yet.

1:53:03.800 --> 1:53:11.680
 So if I were to try to summarize the Wolfram Physics Project, which is, you know, something

1:53:11.680 --> 1:53:17.320
 that's been in your brain for a long time, but really has just exploded in activity,

1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:20.160
 you know, only just months ago.

1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:25.480
 So it's an evolving thing, and next week, I'll try to publish this conversation as quickly

1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:29.120
 as possible, because by the time it's published, already new things will probably have come

1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:30.120
 out.

1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:36.800
 So if I were to summarize it, we've talked about the basics of, there's a hypergraph

1:53:36.800 --> 1:53:45.320
 that represents space, there is transformations in the hypergraph that represents time, that

1:53:45.320 --> 1:53:50.080
 progress of time, there's a cause of graph that's a characteristic of this.

1:53:50.080 --> 1:53:59.320
 And the basic process of science, of science within the Wolfram Physics Model is to try

1:53:59.320 --> 1:54:06.360
 different rules and see which properties of physics that we know of, known physical theories,

1:54:06.360 --> 1:54:10.840
 are appear within the graphs that emerge from that rule.

1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:12.480
 That's what I thought it was going to be.

1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:13.480
 Oh, okay.

1:54:13.480 --> 1:54:14.480
 So what?

1:54:14.480 --> 1:54:15.480
 So what is it?

1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:18.240
 It turns out we can do a lot better than that.

1:54:18.240 --> 1:54:25.240
 It turns out that using kind of mathematical ideas, we can say, and computational ideas,

1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:31.880
 we can make general statements, and those general statements turn out to correspond to things

1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:33.800
 that we know from 20th century physics.

1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:37.920
 In other words, the idea of you just try a bunch of rules and see what they do, that's

1:54:37.920 --> 1:54:40.360
 what I thought we were going to have to do.

1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:47.600
 But in fact, we can say, given causal invariance and computational irreducibility, we can derive,

1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:51.600
 and this is where it gets really pretty interesting, we can derive special relativity, we can derive

1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:54.760
 general relativity, we can derive quantum mechanics.

1:54:54.760 --> 1:55:00.600
 And that's where things really start to get exciting, is it wasn't at all obvious to

1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:05.560
 me that even if we were completely correct, and even if we had, this is the rule, even

1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:10.320
 if we found the rule, to be able to say, yes, it corresponds to things we already know,

1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:13.440
 I did not expect that to be the case.

1:55:13.440 --> 1:55:19.720
 So for somebody who is a simple mind and definitely not a physicist, not even close, what does

1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:23.720
 derivation mean in this case?

1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:29.240
 So let me, this is an interesting question, okay, so there's, so one thing.

1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:31.480
 In the context of computational irreducibility.

1:55:31.480 --> 1:55:37.280
 Yeah, yeah, right, right, so what you have to do, let me go back to, again, the mundane

1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:41.240
 example of fluids and water and things like that, right?

1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:44.200
 So you have a bunch of molecules bouncing around.

1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:49.160
 You can say, just as a piece of mathematics, I happen to do this from cellular automata

1:55:49.160 --> 1:55:56.240
 back in the mid 1980s, you can say, just as a matter of mathematics, you can say the continuum

1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:01.720
 limit of these little molecules bouncing around is the Navier Stokes equations.

1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:07.480
 That's just a piece of mathematics, it's not, it doesn't rely on, you have to make certain

1:56:07.480 --> 1:56:11.580
 assumptions that you have to say, there's enough randomness in the way the molecules

1:56:11.580 --> 1:56:15.600
 bounce around that certain statistical averages work, etc, etc, etc.

1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:20.880
 Okay, it is a very similar derivation to derive, for example, the Einstein equations.

1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:27.120
 Okay, so the way that works, roughly, Einstein equations are about curvature of space.

1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:31.960
 Coverture of space, I talked about sort of how you can figure out dimension of space.

1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:37.320
 There's a similar kind of way of figuring out, if you just sort of say, you know, you're

1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:41.320
 making a larger and larger ball or larger and larger, if you draw a circle on the surface

1:56:41.320 --> 1:56:46.080
 of the earth, for example, you might think the area of a circle is pi r squared, but

1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:51.840
 on the surface of the earth, because it's a sphere, it's not flat, the area of a circle

1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:56.180
 isn't precisely pi r squared, as the circle gets bigger, the area is slightly smaller

1:56:56.180 --> 1:56:59.680
 than you would expect from the formula pi r squared as a little correction term that

1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:03.440
 depends on the ratio of the size of the circle to the radius of the earth.

1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:08.120
 Okay, so it's the same basic thing, allows you to measure from one of these hypergraphs

1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:12.000
 what is its effective curvature.

1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:22.560
 So the little piece of mathematics that explains special general relativity is, can map nicely

1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:27.640
 to describe fundamental property of the hypergraphs, the curvature of the hypergraphs.

1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:32.920
 Okay, so special relativity is about the relationship of time to space.

1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:38.640
 Modern relativity is about curvature in this space represented by this hypergraph.

1:57:38.640 --> 1:57:40.680
 So what is the curvature of a hypergraph?

1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:45.520
 Okay, so first I have to explain, what we're explaining is, first thing you have to have

1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:47.360
 is a notion of dimension.

1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:49.400
 You don't get to talk about curvature of things.

1:57:49.400 --> 1:57:53.960
 If you say, oh, it's a curved line, but I don't know what a line is yet.

1:57:53.960 --> 1:57:59.240
 So yeah, what is the dimension of a hypergraph then, from where we've talked about effective

1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:00.240
 dimension.

1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:02.880
 Right, that's what this is about.

1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:07.520
 That's what this is about is, you have your hypergraph, it's got a trillion nodes in it.

1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:08.800
 What is it roughly like?

1:58:08.800 --> 1:58:11.520
 Is it roughly like a grid, a two dimensional grid?

1:58:11.520 --> 1:58:15.400
 Is it roughly like all those nodes are arranged online?

1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:16.960
 What's it roughly like?

1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:23.480
 And there's a pretty simple mathematical way to estimate that by just looking at the,

1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:28.960
 this thing I was describing, the sort of the size of a ball that you construct in the hypergraph.

1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:33.120
 You just measure that, you can just compute it on a computer for a given hypergraph, and

1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:37.880
 you can say, oh, this thing is wiggling around, but it's roughly corresponds to two or something

1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:41.560
 like that, roughly corresponds to 2.6 or whatever.

1:58:41.560 --> 1:58:46.080
 So that's how you have a notion of dimension in these hypergraphs.

1:58:46.080 --> 1:58:48.800
 Curvature is something a little bit beyond that.

1:58:48.800 --> 1:58:54.520
 If you look at how the size of this ball increases as you increase its radius, curvature is a

1:58:54.520 --> 1:58:59.040
 correction to the size increases associated with dimension.

1:58:59.040 --> 1:59:03.480
 It's a sort of a second order term in determining the size.

1:59:03.480 --> 1:59:08.520
 Just like the area of a circle is roughly pi r squared, so it goes up like r squared.

1:59:08.520 --> 1:59:11.240
 The two is because it's in two dimensions.

1:59:11.240 --> 1:59:17.360
 But when that circle is drawn on a big sphere, the actual formula is pi r squared times one

1:59:17.360 --> 1:59:22.760
 minus r squared over a squared and some coefficient.

1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:28.360
 So in other words, there's a correction, and that correction term, that gives you curvature.

1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:34.240
 And that correction term is what makes this hypergraph have the potential to correspond

1:59:34.240 --> 1:59:35.920
 to curved space.

1:59:35.920 --> 1:59:40.800
 Now the next question is, is that curvature, is the way that curvature works, the way that

1:59:40.800 --> 1:59:46.200
 Einstein's equations for general relativity, is that the way they say it should work?

1:59:46.200 --> 1:59:50.680
 And the answer is yes.

1:59:50.680 --> 1:59:52.480
 And so how does that work?

1:59:52.480 --> 1:59:59.600
 The calculation of the curvature of this hypergraph for some set of rules?

1:59:59.600 --> 2:00:00.600
 No.

2:00:00.600 --> 2:00:01.600
 It doesn't matter what the rules are.

2:00:01.600 --> 2:00:02.600
 It doesn't.

2:00:02.600 --> 2:00:06.680
 So long as they have causal invariance and computational irreducibility and they lead

2:00:06.680 --> 2:00:13.680
 to finite dimensional space, noninfinite dimensional space, noninfinite dimensional.

2:00:13.680 --> 2:00:16.920
 It can grow infinitely, but it can't be infinite dimensional.

2:00:16.920 --> 2:00:19.960
 What does an infinitely dimensional hypergraph look like?

2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:20.960
 So that means?

2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:21.960
 For example.

2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:27.040
 On a tree, you start from one root of the tree, it doubles, doubles again, doubles

2:00:27.040 --> 2:00:28.560
 again, doubles again.

2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:33.280
 And that means if you ask the question, starting from a given point, how many points do you

2:00:33.280 --> 2:00:34.280
 get to?

2:00:34.280 --> 2:00:37.920
 Remember, in like a circle, you get to r squared, the two there.

2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:41.360
 On a tree, you get to, for example, two to the r.

2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:44.400
 It's exponential dimensional, so to speak, or infinite dimensional.

2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:51.800
 Do you have a sense of, in the space of all possible rules, how many lead to infinitely

2:00:51.800 --> 2:00:53.800
 dimensional hypergraphs?

2:00:53.800 --> 2:00:54.800
 Is that?

2:00:54.800 --> 2:00:55.800
 No.

2:00:55.800 --> 2:00:56.800
 Okay.

2:00:56.800 --> 2:00:57.800
 Is that an important thing to know?

2:00:57.800 --> 2:00:59.480
 Yes, it's an important thing to know.

2:00:59.480 --> 2:01:01.600
 I would love to know the answer to that.

2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:05.560
 But it gets a little bit more complicated because, for example, it's very possible in the case

2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:10.080
 that in our physical universe, that the universe started infinite dimensional.

2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:16.200
 And only at the Big Bang, it was very likely infinite dimensional.

2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:23.800
 And as the universe sort of expanded and cooled, its dimension gradually went down.

2:01:23.800 --> 2:01:27.000
 And so one of the bizarre possibilities, which actually there are experiments you can do

2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:31.120
 to try and look at this, the universe can have dimension fluctuations.

2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:34.480
 So in other words, we think we live in a three dimensional universe, but actually there may

2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:40.760
 be places where it's actually 3.01 dimensional, or where it's 2.99 dimensional, and it may

2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:45.640
 be that in the very early universe, it was actually infinite dimensional, and it's only

2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:49.040
 a late stage phenomenon that we end up getting three dimensional space.

2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:54.280
 But from your perspective of the hypergraph, one of the underlying assumptions kind of

2:01:54.280 --> 2:02:01.760
 implied, but do you have a sense, a hope, set of assumptions that the rules that underlie

2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:08.280
 our universe or the rule that underlies our universe is static?

2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:11.920
 Is that one of the assumptions you're currently operating under?

2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:16.600
 Yes, but there's a footnote to that, which we should get to because it requires a few

2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:17.600
 more steps.

2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:21.120
 Well, actually then let's backtrack to the curvature because we're talking about as

2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:29.960
 long as it's finite dimensional, finite dimensional computational irreducibility and causal invariance,

2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:38.080
 and it follows that the large scale structure will follow Einstein's equations.

2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:42.200
 And now let me again qualify that a little bit more, there's a little bit more complexity

2:02:42.200 --> 2:02:45.280
 to it.

2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:52.400
 So Einstein's equations in the simplest form apply to the vacuum, no matter just the vacuum.

2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:59.200
 And they say, in particular what they say is if you have, so there's this term JDSIC,

2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:04.360
 that's a term that means shortest path, comes from measuring shortest paths on the earth.

2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:11.040
 So you look at a bundle of JDSICs, a bunch of shortest paths, it's like the paths that

2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:13.760
 photons would take between two points.

2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:18.760
 Then the statement of Einstein's equations is basically a statement about a certain,

2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:25.040
 as you look at a bundle of JDSICs, the structure of space has to be such that although the

2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:30.000
 cross sectional area of this bundle may, although the actual shape of the cross section may

2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.520
 change, the cross sectional area does not.

2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:38.720
 That's a version, that's the most simple minded version of R mu nu minus a half R g mu nu

2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:43.080
 equals zero, which is the more mathematical version of Einstein's equations.

2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:48.040
 It's a statement of the thing called the Ritchie tensor is equal to zero.

2:03:48.040 --> 2:03:50.880
 That's Einstein's equations for the vacuum.

2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:59.400
 So we get that as a result of this model, but footnote, big footnote, because all the

2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:02.200
 matter in the universe is the stuff we actually care about.

2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:04.120
 The vacuum is not stuff we care about.

2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:07.160
 So the question is, how does matter come into this?

2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:11.920
 And for that, you have to understand what energy is in these models.

2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:20.860
 And one of the things that we realized last year was that there's a very simple interpretation

2:04:20.860 --> 2:04:23.240
 of energy in these models.

2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:33.200
 And energy is basically, well, intuitively, it's the amount of activity in these hypergraphs

2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:37.520
 and the way that that remains over time.

2:04:37.520 --> 2:04:42.560
 So a little bit more formally, you can think about this causal graph as having these edges

2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:47.120
 that represent causal relationships, you can think about, oh boy, there's one more concept

2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:48.120
 that we didn't get to.

2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:51.960
 It's the notion of space like hypersurfaces.

2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:57.320
 So this is not as scary as it sounds.

2:04:57.320 --> 2:04:59.800
 It's a common notion in general activity.

2:04:59.800 --> 2:05:11.840
 The notion is you are defining what is a possibly, what is, what, where in space time might be

2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:14.080
 a particular moment in time.

2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:20.160
 So in other words, what is a consistent set of places where you can say, this is happening

2:05:20.160 --> 2:05:21.800
 now, so to speak.

2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:28.440
 And you make this series of sort of slices through the space time, through this causal

2:05:28.440 --> 2:05:34.760
 graph to represent sort of what we consider to be successive moments in time.

2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:38.880
 It's somewhat arbitrary because you can deform that if you're going at a different speed

2:05:38.880 --> 2:05:45.520
 in special activity, you tip those things, there are different kinds of deformations,

2:05:45.520 --> 2:05:49.040
 but only certain deformations are allowed by the structure of the causal graph.

2:05:49.040 --> 2:05:50.880
 Anyway, be that as it may.

2:05:50.880 --> 2:05:57.000
 The basic point is there is a way of figuring out, you say, what is the energy associated

2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:00.480
 with what's going on in this hypergraph?

2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:06.560
 And the answer is there is a precise definition of that, and it is the formal way to say it

2:06:06.560 --> 2:06:10.720
 is, it's the flux of causal edges through space like hypersurfaces.

2:06:10.720 --> 2:06:14.920
 The slightly less formal way to say it, it's basically the amount of activity.

2:06:14.920 --> 2:06:19.680
 See, the reason it gets tricky is you might say, it's the amount of activity per unit

2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:25.360
 volume in this hypergraph, but you haven't defined what volume is.

2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:27.640
 So it's a little bit, you have to be a little bit more careful.

2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:31.440
 But this hypersurface gives some more formalism to that, that doesn't exist.

2:06:31.440 --> 2:06:32.920
 Yeah, it gives a way to connect that.

2:06:32.920 --> 2:06:36.680
 What intuitive we should think about is the amount of activity.

2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:41.680
 So the amount of activity that kind of remains in one place in the hypergraph corresponds

2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:42.840
 to energy.

2:06:42.840 --> 2:06:46.920
 The amount of activity that is kind of where an activity here affects an activity somewhere

2:06:46.920 --> 2:06:51.480
 else corresponds to momentum.

2:06:51.480 --> 2:06:55.920
 And so one of the things that's kind of cool is that I'm trying to think about how to say

2:06:55.920 --> 2:06:56.920
 this intuitively.

2:06:56.920 --> 2:06:59.880
 The mathematics is easy, but the intuitive version, I'm not sure.

2:06:59.880 --> 2:07:04.000
 But basically the way that things sort of stay in the same place and have activity is

2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000
 associated with rest mass.

2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:10.920
 And so one of the things that you get to derive is E equals MC squared.

2:07:10.920 --> 2:07:17.000
 That is a consequence of this interpretation of energy in terms of the way the causal graph

2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:22.080
 works, which is the whole thing is sort of a consequence of this whole story about updates

2:07:22.080 --> 2:07:23.800
 in hypergraphs and so on.

2:07:23.800 --> 2:07:26.680
 So can you linger on that a little bit?

2:07:26.680 --> 2:07:28.880
 How do we get E equals MC squared?

2:07:28.880 --> 2:07:30.720
 So where does the mass come from?

2:07:30.720 --> 2:07:34.480
 So I mean, is there an intuitive?

2:07:34.480 --> 2:07:41.080
 So okay, first of all, you're pretty deep in the mathematical explorations of this thing

2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:42.080
 right now.

2:07:42.080 --> 2:07:46.040
 We're in a very, we're in flux currently.

2:07:46.040 --> 2:07:51.080
 So maybe you haven't even had time to think about intuitive explanations.

2:07:51.080 --> 2:07:56.480
 But yeah, I mean, this one is, look, roughly what's happening.

2:07:56.480 --> 2:07:58.480
 That derivation is actually rather easy.

2:07:58.480 --> 2:08:01.800
 And everybody, and I've been saying we should pay more attention to this derivation because

2:08:01.800 --> 2:08:05.480
 it's such, you know, because people care about this point, but everybody says, it's just

2:08:05.480 --> 2:08:06.480
 easy.

2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:07.480
 It's easy.

2:08:07.480 --> 2:08:12.960
 So there's some concept of energy that can be intuitively thought of as the activity,

2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:18.160
 the flux, the level, the level of changes that are occurring based on the transformations

2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:21.320
 within a certain volume, however, the heck do you find the volume?

2:08:21.320 --> 2:08:22.320
 Okay.

2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:23.640
 So and then mass.

2:08:23.640 --> 2:08:26.000
 Well, mass is what?

2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:32.240
 This is associated with kind of the energy that does not cause you to that does not somehow

2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:33.720
 propagate through time.

2:08:33.720 --> 2:08:34.720
 Yeah.

2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:38.580
 I mean, one of the things that was not obvious in the usual formulation of special relativity

2:08:38.580 --> 2:08:43.360
 is that space and time are connected in a certain way.

2:08:43.360 --> 2:08:46.520
 Energy and momentum are also connected in a certain way.

2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:50.640
 The fact that the connection of energy to momentum is analogous to the connection to

2:08:50.640 --> 2:08:55.240
 space between space and time is not self evident in ordinary relativity.

2:08:55.240 --> 2:08:58.640
 It is a consequence of the way this model works.

2:08:58.640 --> 2:09:01.360
 It's an intrinsic consequence of the way this model works.

2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:07.840
 And it's all to do with unraveling that connection that ends up giving you this relationship

2:09:07.840 --> 2:09:15.200
 between energy and, well, it's energy, momentum, mass, they're all connected.

2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:23.520
 And so that's hence the general relativity, you have a sense that it appears to be baked

2:09:23.520 --> 2:09:29.600
 in to the fundamental properties of the way these hypergraphs are evolved.

2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:30.720
 Well, I didn't yet get to it.

2:09:30.720 --> 2:09:34.000
 So I got as far as special relativity and equals mc squared.

2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:42.840
 The one last step is in general relativity, the final connection is energy and mass cause

2:09:42.840 --> 2:09:44.920
 curvature in space.

2:09:44.920 --> 2:09:50.760
 And that's something that when you understand this interpretation of energy and you kind

2:09:50.760 --> 2:09:55.480
 of understand the correspondence to curvature and hypergraphs, then you can finally sort

2:09:55.480 --> 2:10:00.920
 of the big final answer is you derive the full version of Einstein's equations for

2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:03.600
 space, time and matter.

2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:04.960
 And that's some...

2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:06.120
 Is that...

2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:07.440
 Have you...

2:10:07.440 --> 2:10:11.600
 That last piece with curvature, has that...

2:10:11.600 --> 2:10:12.600
 Have you arrived there yet?

2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:13.600
 Oh, yeah.

2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:14.600
 We're with...

2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:15.600
 Yes.

2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:16.600
 And here's the way that we...

2:10:16.600 --> 2:10:18.840
 Here's how we're really, really going to know we've arrived, okay?

2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:25.400
 So we have the mathematical derivation, it's all fine, but mathematical derivations, okay.

2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:28.200
 So one thing that's sort of a...

2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:30.920
 We're taking this limit of what happens when...

2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:34.640
 The limit, you have to look at things which are large compared to the size of an elementary

2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:39.760
 length, small compared to the whole size of the universe, large compared to certain kinds

2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:45.000
 of fluctuations, blah, blah, blah, there's a tower of many, many of these mathematical

2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:46.800
 limits that have to be taken.

2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:50.880
 So if you're a pure mathematician saying, where's the precise proof?

2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:55.520
 It's like, well, there are all these limits, we can try each one of them computationally

2:10:55.520 --> 2:11:00.560
 and we can say, yeah, it really works, but the formal mathematics is really hard to do.

2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:05.080
 I mean, for example, in the case of deriving the equations of fluid dynamics from molecular

2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:09.080
 dynamics, that derivation has never been done.

2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:11.440
 There is no rigorous version of that derivation.

2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:12.440
 So...

2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:13.440
 Because you can't do the limits?

2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:15.160
 Yeah, because you can't do the limits.

2:11:15.160 --> 2:11:20.920
 But so the limits allow you to try to describe something general about the system and very

2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:23.840
 particular kinds of limits that you need to take with these very...

2:11:23.840 --> 2:11:24.840
 Right.

2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:27.960
 And the limits will definitely work the way we think they work and we can do all kinds

2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:28.960
 of computer experiments.

2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:29.960
 It's just some hard derivation.

2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:35.720
 Yeah, it's just the mathematical structure kind of ends up running right into computational

2:11:35.720 --> 2:11:39.720
 or reducibility and you end up with a bunch of difficulty there.

2:11:39.720 --> 2:11:43.320
 But here's the way that we're getting really confident that we know completely what we're

2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:49.000
 talking about, which is when people study things like black hole mergers using Einstein's

2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:50.800
 equations, what do they actually do?

2:11:50.800 --> 2:11:54.480
 Well, they actually use mathematics or a whole bunch to analyze the equations and so on.

2:11:54.480 --> 2:12:00.240
 But in the end, they do numerical relativity, which means they take these nice mathematical

2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:04.760
 equations and they break them down so that they can run them on a computer and they break

2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:09.000
 them down into something which is actually a discrete approximation to these equations.

2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:12.480
 Then they run them on a computer, they get results, then you look at the gravitational

2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:14.960
 waves and you see if they match.

2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:19.800
 Turns out that our model gives you a direct way to do numerical relativity.

2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:23.920
 So in other words, instead of saying you start from these continuum equations from Einstein,

2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:27.920
 you break them down into these discrete things, you run them on a computer, you say, we're

2:12:27.920 --> 2:12:28.920
 doing it the other way around.

2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:32.360
 We're starting from these discrete things that come from our model and we're just running

2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:39.560
 big versions of them on a computer and what we're saying is this is how things will work.

2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:45.720
 So the way I'm calling this is proof by compilation, so to speak.

2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:51.000
 That is, in other words, you're taking something where we've got this description of a black

2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:57.520
 whole system and what we're doing is we're showing that what we get by just running our

2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:04.320
 model agrees with what you would get by doing the computation from the Einstein equations.

2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:12.520
 There's a small tangent or actually a very big tangent, but proof by compilation is

2:13:12.520 --> 2:13:15.240
 a beautiful concept.

2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:28.040
 In a sense, the way of doing physics with this model is by running it or compiling it.

2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:34.000
 Have you thought about, and these things can be very large, is there a totally new possibilities

2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:42.680
 of computing hardware and computing software, which allows you to perform this kind of compilation?

2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:45.880
 Well, algorithms, software, hardware.

2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:52.320
 So first comment is, these models seem to give one a lot of intuition about distributed

2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:57.800
 computing, a lot of different intuition about how to think about parallel computation.

2:13:57.800 --> 2:14:01.040
 And that particularly comes from the quantum mechanics side of things, which we didn't

2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:02.960
 talk about much yet.

2:14:02.960 --> 2:14:08.760
 But the question of what, given our current computer hardware, how can we most efficiently

2:14:08.760 --> 2:14:13.440
 simulate things, that's actually partly a story of the model itself, because the model

2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:16.200
 itself has deep parallelism in it.

2:14:16.200 --> 2:14:21.120
 The ways that we're simulating it, we're just starting to be able to use that deep parallelism

2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:24.560
 to be able to be more efficient in the way that we simulate things.

2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:30.240
 But in fact, the structure of the model itself allows us to think about parallel computation

2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:36.480
 in different ways, and one of my realizations is that, so it's very hard to get in your

2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:40.760
 brain how you deal with parallel computation, and you're always worrying about if multiple

2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:44.840
 things can happen on different computers at different times, oh, what happens if this

2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:48.640
 thing happens before that thing, and we've really got, we have these race conditions

2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:52.840
 where something can race to get to the answer before another thing, and you get all tangled

2:14:52.840 --> 2:14:56.080
 up because you don't know which thing is going to come in first.

2:14:56.080 --> 2:15:00.400
 And usually when you do parallel computing, there's a big obsession to lock things down

2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:08.280
 to the point where you've had locks and mutexes, and God knows what else, where you've arranged

2:15:08.280 --> 2:15:11.680
 it so that there can only be one sequence of things that can happen.

2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:14.600
 So you don't have to think about all the different kinds of things that can happen.

2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:20.120
 Well, in these models, physics is forcing us to think about all these possible things

2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:24.960
 that can happen, but these models, together with what we know from physics, is giving

2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:29.440
 us new ways to think about all possible things happening, about all these different things

2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:30.760
 happening in parallel.

2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:31.760
 And so I'm guessing...

2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:34.600
 They have built in protection for some of the parallelism.

2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:37.520
 Well, causal invariance is the built in protection.

2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:41.680
 Causal invariance is what means that even though things happen in different orders,

2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:43.480
 it doesn't matter in the end.

2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:51.640
 As a person who struggled with concurrent programming in Java, with all the basic concepts

2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:57.480
 of concurrent programming, that if there could be built up a strong mathematical framework

2:15:57.480 --> 2:16:02.280
 for causal invariance, that's so liberating.

2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:08.400
 That could be not just liberating, but really powerful for massively distributed computation.

2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:09.400
 Absolutely.

2:16:09.400 --> 2:16:14.960
 No, I mean, what's eventual consistency in distributed databases is essentially the causal

2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:17.000
 invariance idea.

2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:18.000
 So that's...

2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:25.280
 But have you thought about really large simulations?

2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:26.280
 Yeah.

2:16:26.280 --> 2:16:30.800
 I mean, I'm also thinking about, look, the fact is, I've spent much of my life as a language

2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:31.800
 designer, right?

2:16:31.800 --> 2:16:37.320
 So I can't possibly not think about, what does this mean for designing languages for

2:16:37.320 --> 2:16:38.320
 parallel computation?

2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:44.200
 In fact, another thing that's one of these, I'm always embarrassed at how long it's taken

2:16:44.200 --> 2:16:45.760
 me to figure stuff out.

2:16:45.760 --> 2:16:50.880
 But back in the 1980s, I worked on trying to make up languages for parallel computation.

2:16:50.880 --> 2:16:53.040
 I thought about doing graph rewriting.

2:16:53.040 --> 2:16:56.080
 I thought about doing these kinds of things, but I couldn't see how to actually make the

2:16:56.080 --> 2:16:59.280
 connections to actually do something useful.

2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:04.280
 I think now, physics is kind of showing us how to make those things useful.

2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:09.160
 And so my guess is that in time, we'll be talking about, we do parallel programming, we'll be

2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:12.240
 talking about programming in a certain reference frame.

2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:15.400
 Just as we think about thinking about physics in a certain reference frame, it's a certain

2:17:15.400 --> 2:17:17.640
 coordination of what's going on.

2:17:17.640 --> 2:17:21.160
 We say, we're going to program in this reference frame, or let's change the reference frame

2:17:21.160 --> 2:17:25.760
 to this reference frame, and then our program will seem different and we'll have a different

2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:29.040
 way to think about it, but it's still the same program underneath.

2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:33.240
 So let me ask on this topic, because I put out that I'm talking to you, I got way more

2:17:33.240 --> 2:17:34.680
 questions than I can deal with.

2:17:34.680 --> 2:17:41.360
 But what pops to mind is a question somebody asked on Reddit, I think, is, please ask Dr.

2:17:41.360 --> 2:17:46.360
 Wolfram, what are the specs of the computer running the universe?

2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:53.560
 So we're talking about specs of hardware and software for simulations of a large scale

2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:54.560
 thing.

2:17:54.560 --> 2:18:00.360
 What about a scale that is comparative to something that eventually leads to the two

2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:01.840
 of us talking and about?

2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:02.840
 Right, right, right.

2:18:02.840 --> 2:18:07.200
 So actually, I did try to estimate that, and we actually have to go a couple more stages

2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:14.320
 before we can really get to that answer, because we're talking about this thing.

2:18:14.320 --> 2:18:18.440
 This is what happens when you build these abstract systems and you're trying to explain

2:18:18.440 --> 2:18:23.800
 the universe that quite a number of levels are deep, so to speak.

2:18:23.800 --> 2:18:25.600
 But the...

2:18:25.600 --> 2:18:29.160
 You mean conceptually or like literally, because you're talking about small objects and there's

2:18:29.160 --> 2:18:33.960
 10 to the 120 something case number.

2:18:33.960 --> 2:18:38.120
 It is conceptually deep, and one of the things that's happening sort of structurally in this

2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:43.240
 project is there were ideas, there's another layer of ideas, there's another layer of ideas

2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:47.080
 to get to the different things that correspond to physics.

2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:51.200
 They're just different layers of ideas, and they are...

2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:54.680
 It's actually probably, if anything, getting harder to explain this project, because I'm

2:18:54.680 --> 2:18:58.600
 realizing that the fraction of way through that I am so far in explaining this to you

2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:05.040
 is less than... it might be because we know more now, and every week, basically, we know

2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:06.560
 a little bit more and like...

2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:10.480
 Those are just layers on the initial fundamental structure?

2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:12.760
 Yes, but the layers are...

2:19:12.760 --> 2:19:18.720
 You might be asking me, how do we get the difference between fermions and bosons, the

2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:22.720
 difference between particles that can be all in the same state and particles that exclude

2:19:22.720 --> 2:19:23.720
 each other?

2:19:23.720 --> 2:19:24.720
 Okay.

2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:28.080
 Last three days, we've kind of figured that out.

2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:32.160
 And it's very interesting, it's very cool, and it's very...

2:19:32.160 --> 2:19:37.280
 And those are some kind of properties at a certain level, layer of abstraction on the

2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:38.280
 photograph?

2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:39.280
 Yes, yes, and there's...

2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:41.840
 But the layers of abstraction are kind of...

2:19:41.840 --> 2:19:42.840
 They're compounding...

2:19:42.840 --> 2:19:43.840
 Stacking up.

2:19:43.840 --> 2:19:44.840
 So it's difficult, but...

2:19:44.840 --> 2:19:45.840
 But okay.

2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:48.560
 But the specs nevertheless remain the same.

2:19:48.560 --> 2:19:51.080
 The specs underneath, so I have an estimate.

2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:52.560
 So the question is, what are the units?

2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:56.280
 So we've got these different fundamental constants about the world.

2:19:56.280 --> 2:19:58.640
 So one of them is the speed of light, which is the...

2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:02.160
 So the thing that's always the same in all these different ways of thinking about the

2:20:02.160 --> 2:20:06.280
 universe is the notion of time, because time is computation.

2:20:06.280 --> 2:20:12.200
 And so there's an elementary time, which is sort of the amount of time that we ascribe

2:20:12.200 --> 2:20:16.200
 to elapsing in a single computational step.

2:20:16.200 --> 2:20:17.200
 Yeah.

2:20:17.200 --> 2:20:18.200
 Okay?

2:20:18.200 --> 2:20:19.200
 So that's the elementary time.

2:20:19.200 --> 2:20:20.200
 So then there's an elementary...

2:20:20.200 --> 2:20:21.200
 That's a parameter or whatever.

2:20:21.200 --> 2:20:22.200
 That's a constant.

2:20:22.200 --> 2:20:25.000
 It's whatever we define it to be, because I mean, we don't...

2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:26.880
 I mean, it's all relative, right?

2:20:26.880 --> 2:20:27.880
 It doesn't matter.

2:20:27.880 --> 2:20:28.880
 Yes.

2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:29.880
 It doesn't matter what it is, because we could be...

2:20:29.880 --> 2:20:30.880
 It could be slower than...

2:20:30.880 --> 2:20:35.560
 It's just a number, which we use to convert that to second, so to speak, because we are

2:20:35.560 --> 2:20:39.920
 experiencing things and we say, this amount of time has elapsed, so to speak.

2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:41.760
 But we're within this thing, so it doesn't...

2:20:41.760 --> 2:20:42.760
 Absolutely.

2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:43.760
 Yeah.

2:20:43.760 --> 2:20:44.760
 It doesn't matter.

2:20:44.760 --> 2:20:45.760
 Right.

2:20:45.760 --> 2:20:53.400
 But what does matter is the ratio of the spatial distance and this hypergraph to this moment

2:20:53.400 --> 2:20:54.400
 of time.

2:20:54.400 --> 2:20:58.840
 And again, that's an arbitrary thing, but we measure that in meters per second, for example,

2:20:58.840 --> 2:21:01.000
 and that ratio is the speed of light.

2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:05.880
 So the ratio of the elementary distance to the elementary time is the speed of light.

2:21:05.880 --> 2:21:06.880
 Okay?

2:21:06.880 --> 2:21:07.880
 Perfect.

2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:08.880
 And so there's another...

2:21:08.880 --> 2:21:11.520
 There are two other levels of this, okay?

2:21:11.520 --> 2:21:16.640
 So there is a thing which we can talk about, which is the maximum entanglement speed,

2:21:16.640 --> 2:21:21.320
 which is a thing that happens at another level in this whole sort of story of how these things

2:21:21.320 --> 2:21:23.080
 get constructed.

2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:27.200
 It's a sort of maximum speed in the space of quantum states.

2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:31.040
 Just as the speed of light is a maximum speed in physical space, this is a maximum speed

2:21:31.040 --> 2:21:35.520
 in the space of quantum states, there's another level, which is associated with what we call

2:21:35.520 --> 2:21:40.160
 rural space, which is another one of these maximum speeds we'll get to this.

2:21:40.160 --> 2:21:44.960
 So these are limitations on the system that are able to capture the kind of physical universe

2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:47.080
 which we live in, the quantum mechanical...

2:21:47.080 --> 2:21:53.560
 There are inevitable features of having a rule that has only a finite amount of information

2:21:53.560 --> 2:21:54.760
 in the rule.

2:21:54.760 --> 2:22:01.640
 So long as you have a rule that only involves a bounded amount, a limited amount of...

2:22:01.640 --> 2:22:05.520
 Only involving a limited number of elements, limited number of relations, it is inevitable

2:22:05.520 --> 2:22:07.400
 that there are these speed constraints.

2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:08.880
 We knew about the one for speed of light.

2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:12.920
 We didn't know about the one for maximum entanglement speed, which is actually something that is

2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:17.120
 possibly measurable, particularly in black hole systems and things like this.

2:22:17.120 --> 2:22:19.760
 But anyway, this is long story short.

2:22:19.760 --> 2:22:24.120
 You're asking what the processing specs of the universe, of the sort of computation

2:22:24.120 --> 2:22:25.120
 of the universe.

2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:29.160
 There's a question of even what are the units of some of these measurements, okay?

2:22:29.160 --> 2:22:33.560
 So the units I'm using are Wolfram language instructions per second, okay?

2:22:33.560 --> 2:22:36.800
 Because you've got to have some, you know, what computation are you doing?

2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:39.120
 There's got to be some kind of frame of reference there.

2:22:39.120 --> 2:22:44.160
 So because it turns out in the end, there will be, there's sort of an arbitrariness

2:22:44.160 --> 2:22:47.160
 in the language that you use to describe the universe.

2:22:47.160 --> 2:22:53.560
 So in those terms, I think it's like 10 to the 500 Wolfram language operations per second,

2:22:53.560 --> 2:22:57.160
 I think, is the, I think it's of that order, you know, basically.

2:22:57.160 --> 2:22:58.960
 So that's the scale of the computation.

2:22:58.960 --> 2:22:59.960
 What about memory?

2:22:59.960 --> 2:23:02.840
 If there's an interesting thing to say about storage and memory?

2:23:02.840 --> 2:23:06.400
 Well, there's a question of how many sort of atoms of space might there be?

2:23:06.400 --> 2:23:08.840
 You know, maybe 10 to the 400.

2:23:08.840 --> 2:23:11.360
 We don't know exactly how to estimate these numbers.

2:23:11.360 --> 2:23:16.760
 I mean, this is, this is based on some, some, I would say somewhat rickety way of estimating

2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:17.760
 things.

2:23:17.760 --> 2:23:21.200
 You know, when they start to be able to be experiments done, if we're lucky, there will

2:23:21.200 --> 2:23:24.480
 be experiments that can actually nail down some of these numbers.

2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:31.720
 And because of computation reducibility, there's not much hope for very efficient compression,

2:23:31.720 --> 2:23:34.480
 like very efficient representation of this.

2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:35.480
 Question, good question.

2:23:35.480 --> 2:23:38.080
 I mean, there's probably certain things, you know.

2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:43.960
 The fact that we can deduce anything, okay, the question is, how deep does the reducibility

2:23:43.960 --> 2:23:44.960
 go?

2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:45.960
 Right.

2:23:45.960 --> 2:23:46.960
 Okay.

2:23:46.960 --> 2:23:48.360
 And I keep on being surprised that it's a lot deeper than I thought.

2:23:48.360 --> 2:23:49.360
 Okay.

2:23:49.360 --> 2:23:54.280
 And so one of the things is that, that there's a question of sort of how much of the whole

2:23:54.280 --> 2:23:59.440
 of physics do we have to be able to get in order to explain certain kinds of phenomena?

2:23:59.440 --> 2:24:04.560
 Like for example, if we want to study quantum interference, do we have to know what an electron

2:24:04.560 --> 2:24:05.560
 is?

2:24:05.560 --> 2:24:08.520
 It turns out, I thought we did, turns out we don't.

2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:12.440
 I thought to know what energy is, we would have to know what electrons were.

2:24:12.440 --> 2:24:13.440
 We don't.

2:24:13.440 --> 2:24:15.480
 So you can get a lot of really powerful shortcuts.

2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:16.480
 Right.

2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:19.560
 There's a bunch of sort of bulk information about the world.

2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:25.960
 The thing that I'm excited about last few days, okay, is the idea of fermions versus

2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:30.760
 bosons, fundamental idea that, I mean, it's the reason we have matter that doesn't just

2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:35.960
 self destruct is because of the exclusion principle that means that two electrons can

2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:38.440
 never be in the same quantum state.

2:24:38.440 --> 2:24:45.480
 Is it useful for us to maybe first talk about how quantum mechanics fits into the Wolfram

2:24:45.480 --> 2:24:46.480
 physics model?

2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:47.480
 Yes.

2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:48.480
 Let's go there.

2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:49.800
 So we talked about general relativity.

2:24:49.800 --> 2:24:58.560
 Now, what, what have you found for the story of quantum mechanics, right, within and outside

2:24:58.560 --> 2:24:59.800
 of the Wolfram physics?

2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:00.800
 Right.

2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:06.800
 So I mean that the key idea of quantum mechanics, that sort of the typical interpretation is

2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:10.200
 classical physics says a definite thing happens.

2:25:10.200 --> 2:25:14.840
 Quantum physics says there's this whole set of paths of things that might happen and we

2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:19.520
 are just observing some overall probability of how those paths work.

2:25:19.520 --> 2:25:20.520
 Okay.

2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:24.800
 So when you think about our hypergraphs and all these little updates that are going on,

2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:30.120
 there's a very remarkable thing to realize, which is, if you say, well, which particular

2:25:30.120 --> 2:25:33.760
 sequence of updates should you do, say, well, it's not really defined.

2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:37.440
 You can do any of a whole collection of possible sequences of updates.

2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:38.440
 Okay.

2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:44.640
 That set of possible sequences of updates defines yet another kind of graph that we call a

2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:45.640
 multiway graph.

2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:53.240
 And a multiway graph just is a graph where at every node, there is a choice of several

2:25:53.240 --> 2:25:55.440
 different possible things that could happen.

2:25:55.440 --> 2:25:57.840
 So for example, you go this way, you go that way.

2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:02.640
 Those are two different edges in the multiway graph and you're building up the set of possibilities.

2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:06.960
 So actually, like, for example, I just made the one, the multiway graph for tic tac toe.

2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:07.960
 Okay.

2:26:07.960 --> 2:26:12.120
 So tic tac toe, you start off with some, some board that, you know, is everything is blank

2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:17.480
 and then somebody can put down an X somewhere, an O somewhere, and then there are different

2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:18.920
 possibilities at each stage.

2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:19.920
 There are different possibilities.

2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:23.800
 And so you build up this multiway graph of all those possibilities.

2:26:23.800 --> 2:26:28.760
 Now notice that even in tic tac toe, you have the feature that there can be something where

2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:33.760
 you have two different things that happen and then those branches merge because you

2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:37.720
 end up with the same shape of, you know, the same configuration of the board, even though

2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:40.120
 you got there in two different ways.

2:26:40.120 --> 2:26:45.760
 So the thing that's sort of an inevitable feature of our models is that just like quantum

2:26:45.760 --> 2:26:49.200
 mechanics suggests, definite things don't happen.

2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:52.360
 You get this whole multiway graph of all these possibilities.

2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:53.360
 Okay.

2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:58.440
 So then the question is, so that, okay, so that's sort of a picture of what's going on.

2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:02.960
 Now you say, okay, well, quantum mechanics has all these features of, you know, all this

2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:05.040
 mathematical structure and so on.

2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:06.920
 How do you get that mathematical structure?

2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:07.920
 Okay.

2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:09.020
 Couple of, couple of things to say.

2:27:09.020 --> 2:27:14.240
 So quantum mechanics is actually, in a sense, two different theories glued together.

2:27:14.240 --> 2:27:18.800
 Quantum mechanics is the theory of how quantum amplitudes work that more or less give you

2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:20.880
 the probabilities of things happening.

2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:25.680
 And it's the theory of quantum measurement, which is the theory of how we actually conclude

2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:27.280
 definite things.

2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:30.680
 Because the mathematics just gives you these quantum amplitudes, which are more or less

2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:32.600
 probabilities of things happening.

2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:37.240
 But yet we actually observe definite things in the world.

2:27:37.240 --> 2:27:38.800
 Quantum measurement has always been a bit mysterious.

2:27:38.800 --> 2:27:42.720
 It's always been something where people just say, well, the mathematics says this, but then

2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:46.800
 you do a measurement and the philosophical arguments about what the measurement is.

2:27:46.800 --> 2:27:50.240
 But it's not something where there's a theory of the measurement.

2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:58.360
 Somebody on Reddit also asked, please ask Steven to tell his story of this, the double

2:27:58.360 --> 2:27:59.920
 solid experiment.

2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:00.920
 Okay.

2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:01.920
 Yeah, I can.

2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:02.920
 Does that make sense?

2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:03.920
 Oh yeah, it makes sense.

2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:04.920
 Absolutely makes sense.

2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:05.920
 Why?

2:28:05.920 --> 2:28:07.440
 Is this like a good way to discuss?

2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:08.440
 A little bit.

2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:11.200
 Let me go, let me explain a couple of things first.

2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:16.480
 So the structure of quantum mechanics is mathematically quite complicated.

2:28:16.480 --> 2:28:21.000
 One of the features, let's see, how to describe this.

2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:26.960
 So first point is there's this multiway graph of all these different paths of things that

2:28:26.960 --> 2:28:28.880
 can happen in the world.

2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:36.000
 And the important point is that these, you can have branchings and you can have mergings.

2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:43.360
 So this property turns out causal invariance is the statement that the number of mergings

2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:45.880
 is equal to the number of branchings.

2:28:45.880 --> 2:28:50.480
 So in other words, every time there's a branch, eventually there will also be a merge.

2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:54.000
 In other words, every time there were two possibilities for what might have happened,

2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:55.000
 eventually those will merge.

2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:58.360
 Beautiful concept, by the way, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:28:58.360 --> 2:29:06.840
 So that idea, okay, so then, so that's one thing and that's closely related to the sort

2:29:06.840 --> 2:29:08.480
 of objectivity in quantum mechanics.

2:29:08.480 --> 2:29:11.600
 The fact that we believe definite things happen, it's because although there are all

2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:16.720
 these different paths, in some sense, because of causal invariance, they all imply the same

2:29:16.720 --> 2:29:17.720
 thing.

2:29:17.720 --> 2:29:21.440
 I'm cheating a little bit in saying that, but that's roughly the essence of what's going

2:29:21.440 --> 2:29:22.440
 on.

2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:27.440
 Okay, next thing to think about is you have this multiway graph.

2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:30.160
 It has all these different possible things that are happening.

2:29:30.160 --> 2:29:34.400
 Now we ask, this multiway graph is sort of evolving with time.

2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:38.560
 Over time, it's branching, it's merging, it's doing all these things.

2:29:38.560 --> 2:29:46.200
 The question we can ask is, if we slice it at a particular time, what do we see?

2:29:46.200 --> 2:29:51.320
 And that slice represents, in a sense, something to do with the state of the universe at a

2:29:51.320 --> 2:29:53.200
 particular time.

2:29:53.200 --> 2:29:56.880
 So in other words, we've got this multiway graph of all these possibilities and then

2:29:56.880 --> 2:30:05.160
 we're asking, okay, we take this slice, this slice represents, okay, each of these different

2:30:05.160 --> 2:30:09.440
 paths corresponds to a different quantum possibility for what's happening.

2:30:09.440 --> 2:30:13.200
 When we take the slice, we're saying, what are the set of quantum possibilities that

2:30:13.200 --> 2:30:15.080
 exist at a particular time?

2:30:15.080 --> 2:30:20.680
 And when you say slice, you slice the graph and then there's a bunch of leaves and those

2:30:20.680 --> 2:30:23.360
 represent the state of things.

2:30:23.360 --> 2:30:31.160
 Right, but then, okay, so the important thing that you are quickly picking up on is that

2:30:31.160 --> 2:30:34.840
 what matters is kind of how these leaves are related to each other.

2:30:34.840 --> 2:30:40.160
 So a good way to tell how leaves are related is just to say, on the step before, did they

2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:42.320
 have a common ancestor?

2:30:42.320 --> 2:30:46.240
 So two leaves might be, they might have just branched from one thing, or they might be

2:30:46.240 --> 2:30:52.640
 far away, way far apart in this graph, where to get to a common ancestor, maybe you have

2:30:52.640 --> 2:30:55.160
 to go all the way back to the beginning of the graph, all the way back to the beginning

2:30:55.160 --> 2:30:56.160
 of this.

2:30:56.160 --> 2:30:58.440
 There's some kind of measure of distance, yes.

2:30:58.440 --> 2:31:04.040
 But what you get is by making this slice, what you call it, branchial space, the space

2:31:04.040 --> 2:31:06.040
 of branches.

2:31:06.040 --> 2:31:12.040
 And in this branchial space, you have a graph that represents the relationships between

2:31:12.040 --> 2:31:16.800
 these quantum states in branchial space, and you have this notion of distance in branchial

2:31:16.800 --> 2:31:17.800
 space.

2:31:17.800 --> 2:31:18.800
 Okay, so...

2:31:18.800 --> 2:31:21.720
 Is this connected to quantum entanglement, do you do?

2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:28.000
 Yes, it's basically the distance in branchial space is kind of an entanglement distance.

2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:29.000
 So this...

2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:30.000
 That's a very nice model.

2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:31.000
 Right, it is very nice.

2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:32.000
 It's very beautiful.

2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:37.800
 I mean, it's so clean, I mean, it's really...

2:31:37.800 --> 2:31:38.800
 It tells one...

2:31:38.800 --> 2:31:46.000
 Okay, so anyway, so then this branchial space has this sort of map of the entanglements

2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:47.880
 between quantum states.

2:31:47.880 --> 2:31:50.640
 So in physical space, we have...

2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:57.840
 So you can say, let's say the causal graph, and we can slice that at a particular time,

2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:01.480
 and then we get this map of how things are laid out in physical space.

2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:04.880
 When we do the same kind of thing, there's a thing called the multiway causal graph,

2:32:04.880 --> 2:32:07.840
 which is the analog of a causal graph for the multiway system.

2:32:07.840 --> 2:32:13.840
 We slice that, we get essentially the relationships between things, not in physical space, but

2:32:13.840 --> 2:32:15.840
 in the space of quantum states.

2:32:15.840 --> 2:32:19.200
 It's like which quantum state is similar to which other quantum state?

2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:23.800
 Okay, so now I think the next thing to say is just to mention how quantum measurement

2:32:23.800 --> 2:32:24.960
 works.

2:32:24.960 --> 2:32:29.880
 So quantum measurement has to do with reference frames in branchial space.

2:32:29.880 --> 2:32:38.800
 So okay, so measurement in physical space, it matters whether how we assign spatial position

2:32:38.800 --> 2:32:44.640
 and how we define coordinates in space and time, and that's how we make measurements

2:32:44.640 --> 2:32:45.640
 in ordinary space.

2:32:45.640 --> 2:32:48.400
 Are we making a measurement based on us sitting still here?

2:32:48.400 --> 2:32:51.840
 Are we traveling at half the speed of light and making measurements that way?

2:32:51.840 --> 2:32:55.040
 These are different reference frames in which we're making our measurements.

2:32:55.040 --> 2:33:01.160
 And the relationship between different events and different points in space and time will

2:33:01.160 --> 2:33:04.480
 be different depending on what reference frame we're in.

2:33:04.480 --> 2:33:10.000
 Okay, so then we have this idea of quantum observation frames, which are the analog

2:33:10.000 --> 2:33:13.280
 of reference frames, but in branchial space.

2:33:13.280 --> 2:33:20.080
 And so what happens is what we realize is that a quantum measurement is the observer

2:33:20.080 --> 2:33:23.200
 is sort of arbitrarily determining this reference frame.

2:33:23.200 --> 2:33:28.960
 The observer is saying, I'm going to understand the world by saying that space and time are

2:33:28.960 --> 2:33:34.080
 coordinated this way, I'm going to understand the world by saying that quantum states and

2:33:34.080 --> 2:33:36.760
 time are coordinated in this way.

2:33:36.760 --> 2:33:42.120
 And essentially what happens is that the process of quantum measurement is a process

2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:48.840
 of deciding how you slice up this multiway system in these quantum observation frames.

2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:54.000
 So in a sense, the observer, the way the observer enters is by their choice of these

2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:55.840
 quantum observation frames.

2:33:55.840 --> 2:34:02.000
 And what happens is that the observer, because, okay, this is again another stack of other

2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:07.040
 concepts, but anyway, because the observer is computationally bounded, there is a limit

2:34:07.040 --> 2:34:10.240
 to the type of quantum observation frames that they can construct.

2:34:10.240 --> 2:34:11.240
 Interesting.

2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:17.560
 Okay, so there's some constraints, some limit on the choice of observation frames.

2:34:17.560 --> 2:34:22.200
 Right, and by the way, I just want to mention that there's a, I mean, it's bizarre, but

2:34:22.200 --> 2:34:23.920
 there's a hierarchy of these things.

2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:30.680
 So in thermodynamics, the fact that we believe entropy increases, we believe things get more

2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:34.320
 disordered, as a consequence of the fact that we can't track each individual molecule.

2:34:34.320 --> 2:34:38.520
 If we could track every single molecule, we could run every movie in reverse, so to speak,

2:34:38.520 --> 2:34:42.480
 and we would not see that things are getting more disordered.

2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:47.120
 But it's because we are computationally bounded, we can only look at these big blobs of what

2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:53.080
 all these molecules collectively do, that we think that things are, that we describe

2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:56.120
 it in terms of entropy increasing and so on.

2:34:56.120 --> 2:35:01.520
 And it's the same phenomenon, basically, also the consequence of computational irreducibility

2:35:01.520 --> 2:35:07.120
 that causes us to basically be forced to conclude that definite things happen in the world,

2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:10.560
 even though there's this quantum, you know, this set of all these different quantum processes

2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:12.000
 that are going on.

2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:18.920
 So I mean, I'm skipping a little bit, but that's a rough picture.

2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:23.600
 And in the evolution of the Wolfram Physics Project, where do you feel you stand on some

2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:25.280
 of the puzzles that are along the way?

2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:27.480
 See, you're skipping along a bunch of stuff.

2:35:27.480 --> 2:35:30.440
 Oh, it's amazing how much these things are unraveling.

2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:35.160
 I mean, you know, these things, look, it used to be the case that I would agree with Dick

2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:38.800
 Feynman, nobody understands quantum mechanics, including me, okay?

2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:41.840
 I'm getting to the point where I think I actually understand quantum mechanics.

2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:47.600
 My exercise, okay, is, can I explain quantum mechanics for real at the level of kind of

2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:49.600
 middle school type explanation?

2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:50.600
 Right.

2:35:50.600 --> 2:35:51.600
 And I'm getting closer.

2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:52.600
 It's getting, it's getting there.

2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:53.600
 I'm not quite there.

2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:58.560
 I've tried it a few times and I realized that there are things that, where I have to start

2:35:58.560 --> 2:36:00.960
 talking about elaborate mathematical concepts and so on.

2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:05.840
 But I think, and you've got to realize that it's not self evident that we can explain,

2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:11.680
 you know, at an intuitively graspable level, something which, you know, about the way that

2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:12.680
 the universe works.

2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:15.680
 The universe wasn't built for our understanding, so to speak.

2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:23.560
 But, but I think then, then, okay, so another important, important idea is this idea of

2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:27.520
 Braunschild space, which I mentioned, this sort of space of quantum states.

2:36:27.520 --> 2:36:35.400
 It is, okay, so I mentioned Einstein's equations, describing, you know, the effect of, the effect

2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:40.960
 of mass and energy on trajectories of particles on GD6.

2:36:40.960 --> 2:36:47.800
 The curvature of physical space is associated with the presence of energy according to Einstein's

2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:48.800
 equations.

2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:49.800
 Okay.

2:36:49.800 --> 2:36:55.000
 So it turns out that rather amazingly, the same thing is true in Braunschild space.

2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:59.640
 So it turns out the presence of energy or more accurately Lagrangian density, which is

2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:06.240
 a kind of relativistic, invariant version of energy, the presence of that causes essentially

2:37:06.240 --> 2:37:11.040
 deflection of GD6 in this Braunschild space.

2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:12.040
 Okay.

2:37:12.040 --> 2:37:13.040
 So you might say, so what?

2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:18.800
 Well, it turns out that the sort of the best formulation we have of quantum mechanics,

2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:26.720
 this, the Feynman path integral is a thing that describes quantum processes in terms

2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:33.800
 of mathematics that can be interpreted as, well, in quantum mechanics, the big thing

2:37:33.800 --> 2:37:38.520
 is you get these quantum amplitudes, which are complex numbers that represent, when you

2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:41.640
 combine them together, represent probabilities of things happening.

2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:45.480
 And so the big story has been, how do you derive these quantum amplitudes?

2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:49.920
 And people think these quantum amplitudes, they have a complex number has, you know,

2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:55.160
 real part and imaginary part, you can also think of it as a magnitude and a phase.

2:37:55.160 --> 2:37:59.160
 And it, people have sort of thought these quantum amplitudes have magnitude and phase

2:37:59.160 --> 2:38:01.240
 and you compute those together.

2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:07.120
 Turns out that magnitude, the magnitude and the phase come from completely different places.

2:38:07.120 --> 2:38:12.040
 The magnitude comes, okay, so what do you, how do you compute things in quantum mechanics?

2:38:12.040 --> 2:38:16.040
 Roughly, I'm telling you, I'm getting there to be able to do this at a middle school level,

2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:18.280
 but I'm not there yet.

2:38:18.280 --> 2:38:25.480
 The roughly what happens is you're asking, does this state in quantum mechanics evolve

2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:28.000
 to this other state in quantum mechanics?

2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:32.840
 And you can think about that like a particle traveling or something traveling through physical

2:38:32.840 --> 2:38:37.000
 space, but instead it's traveling through branchial space.

2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:40.760
 And so what's happening is, does this quantum state evolve to this other quantum state?

2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:44.720
 It's like saying, does this object move from this place in space to this other place in

2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:45.720
 space?

2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:46.720
 Okay.

2:38:46.720 --> 2:38:53.960
 Now, the way that you, these quantum amplitudes characterize kind of to what extent the thing

2:38:53.960 --> 2:38:57.400
 will successfully reach some particular point in branchial space.

2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:01.120
 Just like in physical space, you could say, oh, it had a certain velocity and it went

2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:02.560
 in this direction.

2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:05.320
 In branchial space, there's a similar kind of concept.

2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:10.800
 Is there a nice way to visualize for me now mentally branchial space?

2:39:10.800 --> 2:39:15.880
 It's just, you have this hypergraph, sorry, you have this multiway graph.

2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:18.600
 It's this big branching thing, branching and merging thing.

2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:23.880
 But I mean, like moving through that space, I'm just trying to understand what that looks

2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:24.880
 like.

2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:31.440
 You know, that space is probably exponential dimensional, which makes it, again, another

2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:34.120
 kind of worms in understanding what's going on.

2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:40.120
 That space, as in ordinary space, this hypergraph, the spatial hypergraph limits to something

2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:46.400
 which is like a manifold, like something like three dimensional space, almost certainly

2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:53.360
 the multiway graph limits to a Hilbert space, which is something that, I mean, it's just

2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:55.720
 a weirder exponential dimensional space.

2:39:55.720 --> 2:39:58.960
 And by the way, you can ask, I mean, there are much weirder things that go on.

2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:02.960
 For example, one of the things I've been interested in is the expansion of the universe in branchial

2:40:02.960 --> 2:40:04.060
 space.

2:40:04.060 --> 2:40:09.160
 So we know the universe is expanding in physical space, but the universe is probably also expanding

2:40:09.160 --> 2:40:11.040
 in branchial space.

2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:15.840
 So that means the number of quantum states of the universe is increasing with time.

2:40:15.840 --> 2:40:17.840
 The diameter of the thing is growing.

2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:18.840
 Right.

2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:27.120
 And by the way, this is related to whether quantum computing can ever work.

2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:28.120
 And

2:40:28.120 --> 2:40:29.120
 Why?

2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:30.120
 Okay.

2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:31.120
 So let me explain why.

2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:32.120
 So let's talk about...

2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:33.120
 Okay.

2:40:33.120 --> 2:40:36.200
 So first of all, just to finish the thought about quantum amplitudes, the incredibly

2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:41.760
 beautiful thing, but I'm just very excited about this.

2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:47.280
 The final path integral is this formula that says that the amplitude, the quantum amplitude

2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:51.840
 is e to the is over h bar, where s is the thing called the action.

2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:52.840
 And it...

2:40:52.840 --> 2:40:53.840
 Okay.

2:40:53.840 --> 2:41:01.000
 So that can be thought of as representing a deflection of the angle of this path in the

2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:02.280
 multiway graph.

2:41:02.280 --> 2:41:06.360
 So it's a deflection of a geodesic in the multiway path that is caused by this thing called

2:41:06.360 --> 2:41:09.280
 the action, which is essentially associated with energy.

2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:10.280
 Okay.

2:41:10.280 --> 2:41:15.600
 And so this is a deflection of a path in branchial space that is described by this path integral,

2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:19.720
 which is the thing that is the mathematical essence of quantum mechanics.

2:41:19.720 --> 2:41:22.840
 Turns out that deflection is...

2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:28.720
 The deflection of geodesics in branchial space follows the exact same mathematical setup

2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:33.400
 as the deflection of geodesics in physical space, except the deflection of geodesics

2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:37.760
 in physical space is described with Einstein's equations, the deflection of geodesics in

2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:42.080
 branchial space is defined by the Feynman path integral, and they are the same.

2:41:42.080 --> 2:41:45.920
 In other words, they are mathematically the same.

2:41:45.920 --> 2:41:53.520
 So that means that general relativity is a story of essentially motion in physical space.

2:41:53.520 --> 2:41:57.680
 Quantum mechanics is a story of essentially motion in branchial space.

2:41:57.680 --> 2:42:02.520
 And the underlying equation for those two things, although it's presented differently

2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:06.240
 because one's interested in different things in branchial space and in physical space,

2:42:06.240 --> 2:42:08.880
 but the underlying equation is the same.

2:42:08.880 --> 2:42:15.280
 So in other words, it's just these two theories, which are the two pillars of 20th century

2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:20.920
 physics, which have seemed to be often different directions, are actually facets of the exact

2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:24.400
 same theory.

2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:29.120
 That's exciting to see where that evolves, and exciting that that just is there.

2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:30.120
 Right.

2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:36.320
 I mean, to me, having spent some part of my early life working in the context of these

2:42:36.320 --> 2:42:42.920
 theories of 20th century physics, they seem so different, and the fact that they're really

2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:46.000
 the same is just really amazing.

2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.800
 Actually, you mentioned double slit experiment.

2:42:48.800 --> 2:42:55.400
 So the double slit experiment is an interference phenomenon where you can have a photon or

2:42:55.400 --> 2:42:59.720
 an electron, and you say there are these two slits that could have gone through either

2:42:59.720 --> 2:43:00.720
 one.

2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:05.720
 But there is this interference pattern where there's destructive interference where you

2:43:05.720 --> 2:43:09.680
 might have said in classical physics, oh, well, if there are two slits, then there's

2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:12.320
 a better chance that it gets through one or the other of them.

2:43:12.320 --> 2:43:16.360
 But in quantum mechanics, there's this phenomenon of destructive interference that means that

2:43:16.360 --> 2:43:22.560
 even though there are two slits, two can lead to nothing, as opposed to two leading to more

2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:25.440
 than, for example, one slit.

2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:29.440
 And in what happens in this model, and we've just been understanding this in the last few

2:43:29.440 --> 2:43:38.000
 weeks, actually, is that what essentially happens is that the double slit experiment

2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:42.000
 is a story of the interface between bronchial space and physical space.

2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:47.040
 And what's essentially happening is that the destructive interference is the result of

2:43:47.040 --> 2:43:51.840
 the two possible paths associated with photons going through those two slits winding up at

2:43:51.840 --> 2:43:54.240
 opposite ends of bronchial space.

2:43:54.240 --> 2:43:59.400
 And so that's why there's sort of nothing there when you look at it, is because the

2:43:59.400 --> 2:44:05.160
 two different sort of branches couldn't get merged together to produce something that

2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:07.720
 you can measure in physical space.

2:44:07.720 --> 2:44:10.600
 Is there a lot to be understood about bronchial space?

2:44:10.600 --> 2:44:11.600
 Yes.

2:44:11.600 --> 2:44:12.600
 There's a lot.

2:44:12.600 --> 2:44:13.600
 Mathematically speaking.

2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:14.600
 Yes.

2:44:14.600 --> 2:44:18.640
 It's a very beautiful mathematical thing, and it's very, I mean, by the way, this whole

2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:24.760
 theory is just amazingly rich in terms of the mathematics that it says should exist.

2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:31.520
 Okay, so for example, calculus is a story of infinitesimal change in integer dimensional

2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:35.000
 space, one dimensional, two dimensional, three dimensional space.

2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:40.200
 We need a theory of infinitesimal change in fractional dimensional and dynamic dimensional

2:44:40.200 --> 2:44:41.520
 space.

2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:42.520
 No such theory exists.

2:44:42.520 --> 2:44:46.920
 So there's tools of mathematics that are needed here, and this is a motivation for that,

2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:47.920
 actually.

2:44:47.920 --> 2:44:48.920
 Right.

2:44:48.920 --> 2:44:52.360
 And there are indications, and we can do computer experiments, and we can see how it's

2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:58.160
 going to come out, but we need to, you know, that the actual mathematics doesn't exist.

2:44:58.160 --> 2:45:01.120
 And in bronchial space, it's actually even worse.

2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:05.720
 There's even more sort of layers of mathematics that are, you know, we can see how it works

2:45:05.720 --> 2:45:11.520
 roughly by doing computer experiments, but to really understand it, we need more sort

2:45:11.520 --> 2:45:13.480
 of mathematical sophistication.

2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:14.880
 Quantum computers.

2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:21.120
 Okay, so the basic idea of quantum computers, the promise of quantum computers is quantum

2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:26.840
 mechanics does things in parallel, and so you can sort of intrinsically do computations

2:45:26.840 --> 2:45:32.440
 in parallel, and somehow that can be much more efficient than just doing them one after

2:45:32.440 --> 2:45:33.440
 another.

2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:37.360
 And, you know, I actually worked on quantum computing a bit with Dick Feynman back in

2:45:37.360 --> 2:45:42.080
 1981, two, three, that kind of time frame, and we...

2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:44.280
 A fascinating image.

2:45:44.280 --> 2:45:46.720
 You and Feynman work on quantum computers.

2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:51.120
 Well, we tried to work... the big thing we tried to do was invent a randomness chip that

2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:56.360
 would generate randomness at a high speed using quantum mechanics, and the discovery

2:45:56.360 --> 2:46:02.520
 that that wasn't really possible was part of the story of... we never really wrote anything

2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:03.520
 about it.

2:46:03.520 --> 2:46:07.440
 I think maybe he wrote some stuff, but we didn't write stuff about what we figured out

2:46:07.440 --> 2:46:12.280
 about sort of the fact that it really seemed like the measurement process in quantum mechanics

2:46:12.280 --> 2:46:18.280
 was a serious damper on what was possible to do in sort of, you know, the possible advantages

2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:20.360
 of quantum mechanics for computing.

2:46:20.360 --> 2:46:26.320
 But anyway, so the sort of the promise of quantum computing is, let's say you're trying

2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:30.440
 to, you know, factor an integer, well, you can... instead of, you know, when you factor

2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:32.680
 an integer, you might say, well, does this factor work?

2:46:32.680 --> 2:46:33.680
 Does this factor work?

2:46:33.680 --> 2:46:35.760
 Does this factor work?

2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:39.560
 In ordinary computing, it seems like we pretty much just have to try all these different

2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:43.160
 factors, you know, kind of one after another.

2:46:43.160 --> 2:46:48.320
 But in quantum mechanics, you might have the idea, oh, you can just sort of have the physics

2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:51.480
 try all of them in parallel, okay?

2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:59.000
 And the, you know, and there's this algorithm, Schor's algorithm, which allows you, according

2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:02.920
 to the formalism of quantum mechanics, to do everything in parallel and to do it much

2:47:02.920 --> 2:47:05.280
 faster than you can on a classical computer.

2:47:05.280 --> 2:47:06.280
 Okay.

2:47:06.280 --> 2:47:10.200
 So the only little footnote is, you have to figure out what the answer is, you have to

2:47:10.200 --> 2:47:12.080
 measure the result.

2:47:12.080 --> 2:47:15.720
 So the quantum mechanics internally has figured out all these different branches, but then

2:47:15.720 --> 2:47:20.320
 you have to pull all these branches together to say, and the classical answer is this,

2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:21.320
 okay?

2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:24.240
 The standard theory of quantum mechanics does not tell you how to do that.

2:47:24.240 --> 2:47:28.520
 It tells you how the branching works, but doesn't tell you the process of corralling

2:47:28.520 --> 2:47:30.320
 all these things together.

2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:35.480
 And that process, which intuitively you can see is going to be kind of tricky, but our

2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:40.440
 model actually does tell you how that process of pulling things together works.

2:47:40.440 --> 2:47:44.760
 And the answer seems to be, we're not absolutely sure, we've only got to two times three so

2:47:44.760 --> 2:47:51.320
 far in, you know, which is kind of in this factorization in quantum computers.

2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:57.000
 But we can, you know, what seems to be the case is that the advantage you get from the

2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:03.520
 parallelization from quantum mechanics is lost from the amount that you have to spend

2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:07.440
 pulling together all those parallel threads to get to a classical answer at the end.

2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:12.720
 Now, that phenomenon is not unrelated to various decoherence phenomena that are seen in practical

2:48:12.720 --> 2:48:14.240
 quantum computers and so on.

2:48:14.240 --> 2:48:18.560
 I mean, I should say, as a very practical point, I mean, it's like, should people stop

2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:20.760
 bothering to do quantum computing research?

2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:26.480
 No, because what they're really doing is they're trying to use physics to get to a new level

2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:31.880
 of what's possible in computing, and that's a completely valid activity.

2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:35.560
 Whether you can really put, you know, whether you can say, oh, you can solve an NP complete

2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:41.000
 problem, you can reduce exponential time to polynomial time, you know, we're not sure.

2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:46.160
 And I'm suspecting the answer is no, but that's not relevant to the practical speedups you

2:48:46.160 --> 2:48:52.480
 can get by using different kinds of technologies, different kinds of physics to do basic computing.

2:48:52.480 --> 2:48:58.480
 So you're saying, I mean, some of the models you're playing with, the indication is that

2:48:58.480 --> 2:49:06.040
 you get all the sheet back together, and, you know, to corral everything together to

2:49:06.040 --> 2:49:12.400
 get the actual solution to the algorithm is you lose all the users.

2:49:12.400 --> 2:49:16.560
 By the way, I mean, so again, this question, do we actually know what we're talking about

2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:18.400
 about quantum computing and so on?

2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:22.560
 So again, we're doing proof by compilation.

2:49:22.560 --> 2:49:26.760
 So we have a quantum computing framework, and we're from language, and which is, you

2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:31.120
 know, standard quantum computing framework that represents things in terms of the standard,

2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:36.880
 you know, formalism of quantum mechanics, and we have a compiler that simply compiles

2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:41.640
 the representation of quantum gates into multiway systems.

2:49:41.640 --> 2:49:45.920
 So and in fact, the message that I got was from somebody who's working on the project

2:49:45.920 --> 2:49:52.280
 who has managed to compile one of the sort of a core formalism based on category theory

2:49:52.280 --> 2:49:57.600
 of core quantum formalism into multiway systems.

2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:00.160
 When you say multiway systems, these multiway graphs?

2:50:00.160 --> 2:50:01.160
 Yes.

2:50:01.160 --> 2:50:03.280
 So you're here compiling, yeah, okay, that's awesome.

2:50:03.280 --> 2:50:06.200
 And then you can do all kinds of experiments on that multiway graph.

2:50:06.200 --> 2:50:07.200
 Right.

2:50:07.200 --> 2:50:10.320
 But the point is that what we're saying is the thing, we've got this representation

2:50:10.320 --> 2:50:14.440
 of, let's say, Shaw's algorithm in terms of standard quantum gates, and it's just a

2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:19.280
 pure matter of sort of computation to just say that is equivalent.

2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:23.440
 We will get the same result as running this multiway system.

2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:26.200
 Can you do complexity analysis on that multiway system?

2:50:26.200 --> 2:50:27.960
 Well, that's what we're being trying to do.

2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:28.960
 Yes.

2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:29.960
 We're getting there.

2:50:29.960 --> 2:50:30.960
 We haven't done that yet.

2:50:30.960 --> 2:50:33.520
 I mean, there's a pretty good indication of how that's going to work out.

2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:38.040
 And we've done it, as I say, our computer experiments, we've unimpressively gotten to

2:50:38.040 --> 2:50:42.800
 about two times three in terms of factorization, which is kind of about how far people have

2:50:42.800 --> 2:50:45.680
 got with physical quantum computers as well.

2:50:45.680 --> 2:50:51.400
 But yes, we definitely will be able to do complexity analysis, and we will be able to

2:50:51.400 --> 2:50:52.400
 know.

2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:58.160
 So the one remaining hope for quantum computing really, really working at this formal level

2:50:58.160 --> 2:51:03.440
 of quantum brand exponential stuff being done in polynomial time and so on, the one

2:51:03.440 --> 2:51:10.080
 hope, which is very bizarre, is that you can kind of piggyback on the expansion of branch

2:51:10.080 --> 2:51:11.360
 shield space.

2:51:11.360 --> 2:51:13.600
 So here's how that might work.

2:51:13.600 --> 2:51:18.960
 So you think, you know, energy conservation, standard thing in high school physics, energy

2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:20.720
 is conserved, right?

2:51:20.720 --> 2:51:25.560
 But now you imagine, you think about energy in the context of cosmology and the context

2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:27.040
 of the whole universe.

2:51:27.040 --> 2:51:28.720
 It's a much more complicated story.

2:51:28.720 --> 2:51:32.560
 The expansion of the universe kind of violates energy conservation.

2:51:32.560 --> 2:51:35.800
 And so for example, if you imagine you've got two galaxies, they're receding from each

2:51:35.800 --> 2:51:41.280
 other very quickly, they've got two big central black holes, you connect to spring between

2:51:41.280 --> 2:51:43.160
 these two central black holes.

2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:46.640
 Not easy to do in practice, but let's imagine you could do it.

2:51:46.640 --> 2:51:52.320
 Now that spring is being pulled apart, it's getting more potential energy in the spring

2:51:52.320 --> 2:51:55.200
 as a result of the expansion of the universe.

2:51:55.200 --> 2:52:00.680
 So in a sense, you are piggybacking on the expansion that exists in the universe and

2:52:00.680 --> 2:52:05.800
 the sort of violation of energy conservation that's associated with that cosmological expansion

2:52:05.800 --> 2:52:10.320
 to essentially get energy, you're essentially building a perpetual motion machine by using

2:52:10.320 --> 2:52:12.600
 the expansion of the universe.

2:52:12.600 --> 2:52:15.320
 And that is a physical version of that.

2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:21.960
 It is conceivable that the same thing can be done in branched space to essentially mine

2:52:21.960 --> 2:52:29.560
 the expansion of the universe in branched space as a way to get sort of quantum computing

2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:34.200
 for free, so to speak, just from the expansion of the universe in branched space.

2:52:34.200 --> 2:52:38.280
 Now the physical space version is kind of absurd and involves, you know, springs between

2:52:38.280 --> 2:52:40.240
 black holes and so on.

2:52:40.240 --> 2:52:44.840
 It's conceivable that the branched space version is not as absurd and that it's actually

2:52:44.840 --> 2:52:49.240
 something you can reach with physical things you can build in labs and so on.

2:52:49.240 --> 2:52:50.240
 We don't know yet.

2:52:50.240 --> 2:52:56.280
 Okay, so you were saying the branched space might be expanding and there might be something

2:52:56.280 --> 2:52:57.880
 that could be exploited.

2:52:57.880 --> 2:52:58.880
 Right.

2:52:58.880 --> 2:53:05.280
 In the same kind of way that you can exploit that expansion of the universe in principle

2:53:05.280 --> 2:53:07.360
 in physical space.

2:53:07.360 --> 2:53:09.120
 You just have like a glimmer of hope.

2:53:09.120 --> 2:53:10.120
 Right.

2:53:10.120 --> 2:53:14.600
 Look, I think the real answer is going to be that for practical purposes, you know,

2:53:14.600 --> 2:53:19.240
 the official brand that says you can, you know, do exponential things upon a number

2:53:19.240 --> 2:53:21.200
 of times is probably not going to work.

2:53:21.200 --> 2:53:23.000
 For people curious to kind of learn more.

2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:25.320
 So this is more like, it's not middle school.

2:53:25.320 --> 2:53:28.760
 We're going to go to elementary school for a second.

2:53:28.760 --> 2:53:29.760
 Maybe middle school.

2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:31.440
 Let's go to middle school.

2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:40.800
 So if I were to try to maybe write a, write a pamphlet of like Wolfram physics project

2:53:40.800 --> 2:53:49.840
 for dummies, aka for me, or maybe make a video on the basics, but not just the basics of

2:53:49.840 --> 2:53:59.320
 the physics project, but the basics plus the most beautiful central ideas.

2:53:59.320 --> 2:54:01.280
 How would you go about doing that?

2:54:01.280 --> 2:54:02.760
 Could you help me out a little bit?

2:54:02.760 --> 2:54:03.760
 Yeah, yeah.

2:54:03.760 --> 2:54:05.800
 I mean, you know, it's a really practical matter.

2:54:05.800 --> 2:54:11.880
 We have this kind of visual summary picture that we made, which I think is a pretty good,

2:54:11.880 --> 2:54:16.120
 you know, when I've tried to explain this to people and it's a pretty good place to

2:54:16.120 --> 2:54:21.080
 start as you got this rule, you know, you apply the rule, you're building up this big

2:54:21.080 --> 2:54:26.200
 hypergraph, you've got all these possibilities, you're kind of thinking about that in terms

2:54:26.200 --> 2:54:27.200
 of quantum mechanics.

2:54:27.200 --> 2:54:30.680
 I mean, that's a, that's a, that's a decent place to start.

2:54:30.680 --> 2:54:37.840
 So basically, the things we've talked about, which is space represented as a hypergraph,

2:54:37.840 --> 2:54:45.600
 transformation of that space is kind of time and then structure of that space and the curvature

2:54:45.600 --> 2:54:49.520
 of that space as gravity, that's a, that can be explained without going anywhere near

2:54:49.520 --> 2:54:50.520
 quantum mechanics.

2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:54.400
 I would say that's actually easier to explain than special relativity.

2:54:54.400 --> 2:54:58.040
 Oh, so going into general, so go into curvature.

2:54:58.040 --> 2:54:59.040
 Yeah.

2:54:59.040 --> 2:55:03.560
 And special relativity, I think is, it's a little bit elaborate to explain.

2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:07.080
 And honestly, you only care about it if you know about special relativity, if you know

2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:09.680
 how special relativity is ordinarily derived and so on.

2:55:09.680 --> 2:55:11.800
 So general relativity is easier?

2:55:11.800 --> 2:55:12.800
 It's easier.

2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:13.800
 Yes.

2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:17.720
 And then what about quantum, what's the easiest way to reveal, I think the, the basic point

2:55:17.720 --> 2:55:22.720
 is just this, this fact that there are all these different branches that there's this

2:55:22.720 --> 2:55:25.560
 kind of map of how the branches work.

2:55:25.560 --> 2:55:31.440
 And that, I mean, I think, I think actually the recent things that we have about the double

2:55:31.440 --> 2:55:35.800
 slit experiment are pretty good because you can actually see this, you can see how the

2:55:35.800 --> 2:55:41.440
 double slit, you know, phenomenon arises from just features of these graphs.

2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:47.040
 Now, you know, having said that, right, there is a little bit of, of slight of hand there

2:55:47.040 --> 2:55:53.520
 because the, the true story of the way that double slit thing works depends on the coordination

2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:59.640
 of branchial space that, for example, in our internal team, there is still a vigorous battle

2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:01.680
 going on about how that works.

2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:06.640
 And it's, it's what's becoming clear is, I mean, what's becoming clear is that it's

2:56:06.640 --> 2:56:08.800
 mathematically really quite interesting.

2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:12.640
 I mean, that is, that there's a, you know, it involves essentially putting space filling

2:56:12.640 --> 2:56:16.560
 curves, you basically have a thing which is naturally two dimensional, and you're sort

2:56:16.560 --> 2:56:20.880
 of mapping it into one dimension with a space filling curve, and it's like, why is it this

2:56:20.880 --> 2:56:25.080
 space filling curve and another space filling curve, and that becomes a story about Riemann

2:56:25.080 --> 2:56:28.560
 surfaces and things, and it's quite elaborate.

2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:34.400
 And but, but the, there's a moral, a little bit slight of hand way of doing it, where

2:56:34.400 --> 2:56:36.800
 it's, you know, it's surprisingly direct.

2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:42.920
 It's, so a question that might be difficult to answer.

2:56:42.920 --> 2:56:49.760
 But for several levels of people, could you give me advice on how we can learn more?

2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:56.360
 Yeah, specifically, there is people that are completely outside and just curious and are

2:56:56.360 --> 2:57:01.040
 captivated by the beauty of hypergraphs, actually.

2:57:01.040 --> 2:57:04.480
 So people that just want to explore play around with this.

2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:13.840
 Second level is people from, say, people like me, who somehow got a PhD in computer science,

2:57:13.840 --> 2:57:19.040
 but are not physicists, and but fundamentally, the work you're doing is a computational

2:57:19.040 --> 2:57:20.040
 nature.

2:57:20.040 --> 2:57:21.400
 So it feels very accessible.

2:57:21.400 --> 2:57:22.400
 Yes.

2:57:22.400 --> 2:57:29.840
 So what are, what can a person like that do to learn enough physics or not to be able

2:57:29.840 --> 2:57:38.360
 to, one, explore the beauty of it, and two, the final level of contribute something of

2:57:38.360 --> 2:57:46.000
 a level of even publishable, you know, like strong, interesting ideas at all those layers.

2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:50.520
 Big beginner, CS person, and the CS person that wants to publish.

2:57:50.520 --> 2:57:51.520
 Right.

2:57:51.520 --> 2:57:55.640
 I mean, I think that, you know, I've written a bunch of stuff, doesn't go Jonathan Gaurad,

2:57:55.640 --> 2:58:00.120
 who's been a key person working on this project, has also written a bunch of stuff.

2:58:00.120 --> 2:58:02.280
 And some other people started writing things too.

2:58:02.280 --> 2:58:03.280
 He's a physicist.

2:58:03.280 --> 2:58:04.280
 Physicist.

2:58:04.280 --> 2:58:06.400
 Well, he's, I would say, a mathematical physicist.

2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:07.400
 Mathematical physicist.

2:58:07.400 --> 2:58:09.440
 He's pretty mathematically sophisticated.

2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:11.800
 He regularly outmathematicizes me.

2:58:11.800 --> 2:58:12.800
 Yeah.

2:58:12.800 --> 2:58:13.800
 Strong, yeah.

2:58:13.800 --> 2:58:14.800
 Strong mathematical physicist.

2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:15.800
 Yeah.

2:58:15.800 --> 2:58:16.800
 I looked at some of the papers.

2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:17.800
 Right.

2:58:17.800 --> 2:58:22.640
 But so, so, I mean, you know, I wrote this kind of original announcement blog post about

2:58:22.640 --> 2:58:28.520
 this project, which people seem to have found, I've been really happy, actually, that people,

2:58:28.520 --> 2:58:35.000
 who, you know, people seem to have groked key points from that.

2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:39.640
 Much deeper key points, people seem to have groked than I thought they would grok.

2:58:39.640 --> 2:58:42.800
 And then that's a kind of a long blog post that explains some of the things we talked

2:58:42.800 --> 2:58:48.240
 about, like the hypograph and the basic rules, and I don't, does it, I forget, it doesn't

2:58:48.240 --> 2:58:49.240
 have any quantum mechanics.

2:58:49.240 --> 2:58:50.240
 Oh, yeah.

2:58:50.240 --> 2:58:51.240
 It does.

2:58:51.240 --> 2:58:52.240
 It goes through quantum mechanics.

2:58:52.240 --> 2:58:53.240
 Yes, it does.

2:58:53.240 --> 2:58:56.840
 But we know a little bit more since that blog post that probably clarifies, but that blog

2:58:56.840 --> 2:58:59.680
 post does a pretty decent job.

2:58:59.680 --> 2:59:03.280
 And, you know, talking about things like, again, something we didn't mention, the fact that

2:59:03.280 --> 2:59:07.800
 the uncertainty principle is a consequence of curvature in branchial space.

2:59:07.800 --> 2:59:14.400
 How much physics should a person know to be able to understand the beauty of this framework

2:59:14.400 --> 2:59:16.960
 and to contribute something novel?

2:59:16.960 --> 2:59:20.320
 Okay, so I think that those are different questions.

2:59:20.320 --> 2:59:23.880
 So I mean, I think that the, why does this work?

2:59:23.880 --> 2:59:27.480
 Why does this make any sense?

2:59:27.480 --> 2:59:30.800
 To really know that, you have to know a fair amount of physics.

2:59:30.800 --> 2:59:31.800
 Okay.

2:59:31.800 --> 2:59:33.280
 And for example, have a...

2:59:33.280 --> 2:59:39.360
 When you say, why does this work, you're referring to the connection between this model and...

2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:40.360
 General relativity, for example.

2:59:40.360 --> 2:59:41.360
 General relativity.

2:59:41.360 --> 2:59:42.360
 You have to understand something about general relativity.

2:59:42.360 --> 2:59:43.360
 And that's a...

2:59:43.360 --> 2:59:47.560
 There's also a side of this where just as a pure mathematical framework is fascinating.

2:59:47.560 --> 2:59:48.560
 Yes.

2:59:48.560 --> 2:59:50.440
 If you throw the physics out, completely.

2:59:50.440 --> 2:59:54.680
 Then it's quite accessible to, I mean, you know, I wrote this sort of long technical

2:59:54.680 --> 2:59:59.960
 introduction to the project, which seems to have been very accessible to people who are,

2:59:59.960 --> 3:00:05.080
 you know, who understand computation and formal abstract ideas, but are not specialists in

3:00:05.080 --> 3:00:07.080
 physics or other kinds of things.

3:00:07.080 --> 3:00:13.360
 I mean, the thing with the physics part of it is, you know, it's...

3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:15.800
 There's both a way of thinking and a...

3:00:15.800 --> 3:00:16.800
 Literally a mathematical formalism.

3:00:16.800 --> 3:00:20.520
 I mean, it's like, you know, to know that we get the Einstein equations, to know we get

3:00:20.520 --> 3:00:24.960
 the energy momentum tensor, you kind of have to know what the energy momentum tensor is.

3:00:24.960 --> 3:00:25.960
 And that's physics.

3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:29.480
 I mean, that's kind of graduate level physics, basically.

3:00:29.480 --> 3:00:36.680
 And so that, you know, making that final connection requires some depth of physics knowledge.

3:00:36.680 --> 3:00:40.520
 I mean, that's the unfortunate thing, the difference in machine learning and physics

3:00:40.520 --> 3:00:42.960
 in the 21st century.

3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:47.320
 Is it really out of reach of a year or two worth of study?

3:00:47.320 --> 3:00:49.960
 No, you could get it in a year or two.

3:00:49.960 --> 3:00:51.600
 But you can't get it in a month.

3:00:51.600 --> 3:00:52.600
 Right.

3:00:52.600 --> 3:00:53.600
 I mean...

3:00:53.600 --> 3:00:56.080
 So, but it doesn't require necessarily like 15 years?

3:00:56.080 --> 3:00:57.080
 No, it does not.

3:00:57.080 --> 3:01:01.520
 And in fact, a lot of what has happened with this project makes a lot of this stuff much

3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:02.880
 more accessible.

3:01:02.880 --> 3:01:07.480
 There are things where it has been quite difficult to explain what's going on and it requires

3:01:07.480 --> 3:01:13.840
 much more, you know, having the concreteness of being able to do simulations, knowing that

3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:17.760
 this thing that you might have thought was just an analogy is really actually what's

3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:24.320
 going on makes one feel much more secure about just sort of saying, this is how this works.

3:01:24.320 --> 3:01:28.840
 And I think it will be, you know, the, I'm hoping the textbooks of the future, the physics

3:01:28.840 --> 3:01:33.080
 textbooks of the future, there will be a certain compression, there will be things that used

3:01:33.080 --> 3:01:36.600
 to be very much more elaborate, because for example, even doing continuous mathematics

3:01:36.600 --> 3:01:41.160
 versus this discrete mathematics, that, you know, to know how things work in continuous

3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:45.000
 mathematics, you have to be talking about stuff and waving your hands about things.

3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:51.000
 Whereas with the discrete version, it's just like, here is a picture, this is how it works.

3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:55.600
 And there's no, oh, do we get the limit right to this, you know, to this thing that is of,

3:01:55.600 --> 3:02:00.960
 you know, zero, you know, measure zero object, you know, interact with this thing in the

3:02:00.960 --> 3:02:01.960
 right way.

3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:03.440
 You don't have to have that whole discussion.

3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:07.320
 It's just like, here's a picture, you know, this is what it does.

3:02:07.320 --> 3:02:10.520
 And you know, you can, then it takes more effort to say, what does it do in the limit

3:02:10.520 --> 3:02:11.760
 when the picture gets very big?

3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:14.480
 But you can do experiments to build up an intuition, actually.

3:02:14.480 --> 3:02:15.480
 Yes, right.

3:02:15.480 --> 3:02:17.480
 And you can get sort of core intuition for what's going on.

3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:22.680
 Now, in terms of contributing to this, you know, I would say that the study of the computational

3:02:22.680 --> 3:02:26.320
 universe and how all these programs work in the computational universe, there's just

3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:28.960
 an unbelievable amount to do there.

3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:31.400
 And it is very close to the surface.

3:02:31.400 --> 3:02:38.040
 That is, you know, high school kids, you can do experiments, it's not, you know, and you

3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:39.040
 can discover things.

3:02:39.040 --> 3:02:43.720
 I mean, you know, we, you can discover stuff about, I don't know, like this thing about

3:02:43.720 --> 3:02:47.640
 expansion of partial space, that's an absolutely accessible thing to look at.

3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:53.520
 Now, you know, the main issue with doing these things is not, there isn't a lot of technical

3:02:53.520 --> 3:02:56.160
 depth difficulty there.

3:02:56.160 --> 3:03:00.080
 The actual doing of the experiments, you know, all the code is all on our website to do all

3:03:00.080 --> 3:03:01.400
 these things.

3:03:01.400 --> 3:03:05.720
 The real thing is sort of the judgment of what's the right experiment to do?

3:03:05.720 --> 3:03:08.080
 How do you interpret what you see?

3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:11.960
 That's the part that, you know, people will do amazing things with.

3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:17.040
 And that's the part that, but, but it isn't like you have to have done 10 years of study

3:03:17.040 --> 3:03:18.920
 to get to the point where you can do the experiments.

3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:19.920
 That's a cool thing.

3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:22.360
 You can do experiments day one, basically.

3:03:22.360 --> 3:03:23.360
 Right.

3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:27.880
 That's the amazing thing about, and you've actually put the tools out there as beautiful

3:03:27.880 --> 3:03:29.800
 and mysterious.

3:03:29.800 --> 3:03:32.840
 There's still, I would say, maybe you can correct me.

3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:37.960
 It feels like there's a huge number of log hanging fruit on the mathematical side at least,

3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:40.000
 not the, not the physics side, perhaps.

3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:45.760
 No, there's, look, on the, on the, okay, on the physics side, we are, we're definitely

3:03:45.760 --> 3:03:48.640
 in harvesting mode, you know.

3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:49.840
 Of which, which fruit?

3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:50.840
 The low hanging ones?

3:03:50.840 --> 3:03:51.840
 The low hanging ones.

3:03:51.840 --> 3:03:52.840
 Yeah.

3:03:52.840 --> 3:03:53.840
 Right.

3:03:53.840 --> 3:03:54.840
 I mean, basically here's the thing.

3:03:54.840 --> 3:03:57.920
 There's a certain list of, you know, here are the effects in quantum mechanics, here

3:03:57.920 --> 3:03:59.920
 are the effects in general relativity.

3:03:59.920 --> 3:04:02.320
 It's just like industrial harvesting.

3:04:02.320 --> 3:04:05.880
 It's like, can we get this one, this one, this one, this one, this one.

3:04:05.880 --> 3:04:10.280
 And the thing that's really, you know, interesting and satisfying, and it's like, you know, is

3:04:10.280 --> 3:04:13.000
 one climbing the right mountain, does one have the right model?

3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:17.840
 The thing that's just amazing is, you know, we keep on like, are we going to get this

3:04:17.840 --> 3:04:18.840
 one?

3:04:18.840 --> 3:04:20.080
 How hard is this one?

3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:22.920
 It's like, oh, you know, it looks really hard.

3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:23.920
 It looks really hard.

3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:26.960
 Oh, actually we can get it.

3:04:26.960 --> 3:04:29.000
 And you're, you're continually surprised.

3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:31.640
 I mean, it seems like I've been following your progress.

3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:35.920
 It's kind of exciting, all the in harvesting mode, all the things you're picking up along

3:04:35.920 --> 3:04:36.920
 the way.

3:04:36.920 --> 3:04:37.920
 Right.

3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:40.160
 No, I mean, it's the thing that is, I keep on thinking it's going to be more difficult

3:04:40.160 --> 3:04:41.160
 than it is.

3:04:41.160 --> 3:04:46.520
 Now, that's a, you know, that's a, who knows what, I mean, the one thing, so the, the thing

3:04:46.520 --> 3:04:51.440
 that's been a, was a big thing that I think we're pretty close to, I mean, I can give

3:04:51.440 --> 3:04:52.440
 you a little bit of the roadmap.

3:04:52.440 --> 3:04:55.840
 It's sort of interesting to see, it's like, what are particles?

3:04:55.840 --> 3:04:56.840
 What are things like electrons?

3:04:56.840 --> 3:04:58.520
 How do they really work?

3:04:58.520 --> 3:05:00.720
 Are you close to get like, what, what's a, are you close to get, like, what, what's

3:05:00.720 --> 3:05:06.000
 a, are you close to trying to understand like the atom, the electrons, neutrons, protons?

3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:07.000
 Okay.

3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:08.120
 So this is, this is the stack.

3:05:08.120 --> 3:05:13.480
 So the first thing we want to understand is the quantization of spin.

3:05:13.480 --> 3:05:16.000
 So particles, they, they kind of spin.

3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:21.040
 They have a certain angular momentum, that angular momentum, even though the masses of

3:05:21.040 --> 3:05:26.080
 particles all over the place, you know, the electron has a mass of 0.511 MAV, the, but

3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:29.040
 you know, the proton is 938 MAV, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

3:05:29.040 --> 3:05:30.760
 They're all kind of random numbers.

3:05:30.760 --> 3:05:34.960
 The, the spins of all these particles that are either integers or half integers.

3:05:34.960 --> 3:05:39.440
 And that's the fact that was discovered in the 1920s, I guess.

3:05:39.440 --> 3:05:46.320
 The, I think that we are close to understanding why spin is quantized.

3:05:46.320 --> 3:05:51.160
 And that's a, and it appears to be a quite elaborate mathematical story about homotopy

3:05:51.160 --> 3:05:54.680
 groups in twister space and all kinds of things.

3:05:54.680 --> 3:05:58.200
 But bottom line is that seems within reach.

3:05:58.200 --> 3:06:02.320
 And that's, that's a big deal because that's a very core feature of understanding how particles

3:06:02.320 --> 3:06:04.520
 work in quantum mechanics.

3:06:04.520 --> 3:06:09.280
 Another core feature is this difference between particles that obey the exclusion principle

3:06:09.280 --> 3:06:13.880
 and sort of stay apart that leads to the stability of matter and things like that.

3:06:13.880 --> 3:06:19.040
 And particles that love to get together and be in the same state, things like photons that,

3:06:19.040 --> 3:06:24.200
 and that's what leads to phenomena like lasers, where you can get sort of coherently everything

3:06:24.200 --> 3:06:25.760
 in the same state.

3:06:25.760 --> 3:06:31.280
 That difference is the particles of integer spin or bosons like to get together in the

3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:32.280
 same state.

3:06:32.280 --> 3:06:37.840
 The particles of half integer spin of fermions, like electrons that they tend to stay apart.

3:06:37.840 --> 3:06:42.160
 And so the question is, can we, can we get that in our models?

3:06:42.160 --> 3:06:49.160
 And oh, just the last few days, I think we made, I mean, I think the story of, I mean,

3:06:49.160 --> 3:06:51.560
 it's one of these things where we're really close.

3:06:51.560 --> 3:06:54.360
 It's just connected fermions and bosons, you were talking about.

3:06:54.360 --> 3:06:57.960
 So this was what happens is what seems to happen, okay?

3:06:57.960 --> 3:07:01.640
 It's, you know, subject to revision in the next few days.

3:07:01.640 --> 3:07:07.000
 But what seems to be the case is that bosons are associated with essentially merging in

3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:12.240
 multiway graphs and fermions are associated with branching in multiway graphs.

3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:18.640
 And that essentially the exclusion principle is the fact that in branchial space, things

3:07:18.640 --> 3:07:23.600
 have a certain extent in branchial space that in which things are being sort of forced

3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:27.880
 apart in branchial space, whereas the case of bosons, they get, they, they come together

3:07:27.880 --> 3:07:29.600
 in branchial space.

3:07:29.600 --> 3:07:33.320
 And the real question is, can we explain the relationship between that and these things

3:07:33.320 --> 3:07:37.800
 called spinners, which are the representation of half integer spin particles that have this

3:07:37.800 --> 3:07:42.120
 weird feature that usually when you go around 360 degree rotation, you get back to where

3:07:42.120 --> 3:07:43.120
 you started from.

3:07:43.120 --> 3:07:46.120
 But for a spinner, you don't get back to where you started from.

3:07:46.120 --> 3:07:50.360
 It takes 720 degrees of rotation to get back to where you started from.

3:07:50.360 --> 3:07:55.440
 And we are just, it feels like we are, we're just incredibly close to actually having that

3:07:55.440 --> 3:07:57.280
 understanding how that works.

3:07:57.280 --> 3:08:03.800
 And it turns out, it looks like my current speculation is that it's as simple as the

3:08:03.800 --> 3:08:10.440
 directed hypergraphs versus undirected hypergraphs of the relationship between spinners and vectors.

3:08:10.440 --> 3:08:11.440
 So which is just,

3:08:11.440 --> 3:08:12.440
 It's interesting.

3:08:12.440 --> 3:08:16.560
 Yeah, that would be interesting if these are all these kind of nice properties of this

3:08:16.560 --> 3:08:20.160
 multiway graphs of branching and rejoining.

3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:21.880
 Spinners have been very mysterious.

3:08:21.880 --> 3:08:25.480
 And if that's what they turn out to be, there's going to be an easy explanation of what's

3:08:25.480 --> 3:08:26.480
 going on.

3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:27.480
 Yeah, it's directed versus undirected.

3:08:27.480 --> 3:08:30.760
 It's just, and that's why there's only two different cases.

3:08:30.760 --> 3:08:31.760
 It's

3:08:31.760 --> 3:08:34.280
 Well, why are spinners important in quantum mechanics?

3:08:34.280 --> 3:08:35.560
 Can you just give a...

3:08:35.560 --> 3:08:41.440
 Yeah, so spinners are important because they are, they're the representation of electrons

3:08:41.440 --> 3:08:43.560
 which have half integer spin.

3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:48.560
 They are the wave functions of electrons are spinners.

3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:51.360
 Just like the wave functions of photons are vectors.

3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:54.760
 The wave functions of electrons are spinners.

3:08:54.760 --> 3:09:00.960
 And they have this property that when you rotate by 360 degrees, they come back to minus

3:09:00.960 --> 3:09:07.160
 one of themselves and take 720 degrees to get back to the original value.

3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:10.760
 And they are a consequence of...

3:09:10.760 --> 3:09:17.480
 We usually think of rotation in space as being, when you have this notion of rotational

3:09:17.480 --> 3:09:22.640
 invariance, and rotational invariance, as we ordinarily experience it, doesn't have

3:09:22.640 --> 3:09:23.640
 the feature.

3:09:23.640 --> 3:09:26.960
 If you go through 360 degrees, you go back to where you started from, but that's not

3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:28.600
 true for electrons.

3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:32.320
 And so that's why understanding how that works is important.

3:09:32.320 --> 3:09:37.200
 Yeah, I've been playing with Mobius strip quite a bit lately just for fun.

3:09:37.200 --> 3:09:38.200
 Yes, yes.

3:09:38.200 --> 3:09:41.120
 It adds some funk, it has the same kind of funky property.

3:09:41.120 --> 3:09:42.120
 Yes, right, exactly.

3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:45.960
 You can have this so called belt trick, which is this way of taking an extended object

3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:49.880
 and you can see properties like spinners with that kind of extended object that...

3:09:49.880 --> 3:09:53.960
 Yeah, it would be very cool if there's somehow connects the directive or some directive.

3:09:53.960 --> 3:09:54.960
 I think that's what it's going to be.

3:09:54.960 --> 3:09:56.800
 I think it's going to be as simple as that.

3:09:56.800 --> 3:09:57.800
 But we'll see.

3:09:57.800 --> 3:10:02.120
 I mean, this is the thing that, you know, this is the big sort of bizarre surprise is

3:10:02.120 --> 3:10:07.960
 that, you know, because, you know, I learned physics is probably, let's say, let's say

3:10:07.960 --> 3:10:11.880
 a fifth generation in the sense that, you know, if you go back to the 1920s and so on

3:10:11.880 --> 3:10:16.120
 there were the people who originating quantum mechanics and so on, maybe it's a little less

3:10:16.120 --> 3:10:17.120
 than that.

3:10:17.120 --> 3:10:21.760
 Maybe I was like a third generation or something, I don't know, but, you know, the people from

3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:27.680
 whom I learned physics were the people who have been students of the students of the

3:10:27.680 --> 3:10:31.360
 people who originated the current understanding of physics.

3:10:31.360 --> 3:10:35.960
 And we're now at, you know, probably the seventh generation of physicists or something from

3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:38.560
 the early days of 20th century physics.

3:10:38.560 --> 3:10:44.760
 And, you know, whenever a field gets that many generations deep, it seems the foundations

3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:46.760
 seem quite inaccessible.

3:10:46.760 --> 3:10:50.200
 And they seem, you know, it seems like you can't possibly understand that we've gone

3:10:50.200 --> 3:10:54.880
 through, you know, seven academic generations, and that's been, you know, that's been this

3:10:54.880 --> 3:10:58.680
 thing that's been difficult to understand for that long.

3:10:58.680 --> 3:11:00.560
 It just can't be that simple.

3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:06.680
 And in a sense, maybe that journey takes you to a to a simple explanation that was there

3:11:06.680 --> 3:11:07.680
 all along.

3:11:07.680 --> 3:11:08.680
 Right, right, right.

3:11:08.680 --> 3:11:12.840
 I mean, you know, and the thing for me personally, the thing that's been quite interesting is,

3:11:12.840 --> 3:11:16.440
 you know, I didn't expect this project to work in this way.

3:11:16.440 --> 3:11:20.720
 And I, you know, but I had this sort of weird piece of personal history that I used to be

3:11:20.720 --> 3:11:21.720
 a physicist.

3:11:21.720 --> 3:11:22.720
 Yeah.

3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:23.720
 And I used to do all this stuff.

3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:28.960
 And I know, you know, the standard canon of physics, I knew it very well.

3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:33.240
 And, you know, but then I've been working on this kind of computational paradigm for

3:11:33.240 --> 3:11:39.840
 basically 40 years, and the fact that, you know, I'm sort of now coming back to, to,

3:11:39.840 --> 3:11:45.040
 you know, trying to apply that in physics, it kind of felt like that journey was necessary.

3:11:45.040 --> 3:11:49.160
 Was this, when did you first try to play with a hypograph?

3:11:49.160 --> 3:11:55.120
 So I, yeah, so what I had was, okay, so this is again, you know, when it always feels dumb

3:11:55.120 --> 3:12:02.200
 after the fact, it's, it's, it's obvious after the fact, but, but so back in the early 1990s,

3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:07.640
 I realized that using graphs as a sort of underlying thing underneath space and time

3:12:07.640 --> 3:12:09.680
 was going to be a useful thing to do.

3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:12.720
 I figured out about multiway systems.

3:12:12.720 --> 3:12:17.600
 I figured out the things about general relativity I'd figured out by the end of the 1990s.

3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:22.040
 But I always felt there was a certain inelegance because I was using these graphs and there

3:12:22.040 --> 3:12:26.120
 were certain constraints on these graphs that seemed like they were, they were kind of awkward.

3:12:26.120 --> 3:12:30.920
 It was kind of like, you can pick, it's like, you couldn't pick any rule, it was like pick

3:12:30.920 --> 3:12:33.040
 any number, but the number has to be prime.

3:12:33.040 --> 3:12:36.840
 It was kind of like you couldn't, it was kind of an awkward special constraint.

3:12:36.840 --> 3:12:41.400
 I had these trivalent graphs, graphs with just three connections from every node.

3:12:41.400 --> 3:12:45.120
 Okay, so, but, but I discovered a bunch of stuff with that, but I thought it was kind

3:12:45.120 --> 3:12:46.120
 of inelegant.

3:12:46.120 --> 3:12:50.040
 And, you know, the other piece of sort of personal history is obviously I spent my life

3:12:50.040 --> 3:12:53.040
 as a language, computational language designer.

3:12:53.040 --> 3:12:57.160
 And so the story of computational language design is a story of how do you take all these

3:12:57.160 --> 3:13:02.720
 random ideas in the world and kind of grind them down into something that is computationally

3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:04.840
 as simple as possible.

3:13:04.840 --> 3:13:09.160
 And so, you know, I've been very interested in kind of simple computational frameworks

3:13:09.160 --> 3:13:15.320
 for representing things and have, you know, ridiculous amounts of experience in, in trying

3:13:15.320 --> 3:13:16.320
 to do that.

3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:19.400
 And actually all of those trajectories of your life kind of came together.

3:13:19.400 --> 3:13:24.240
 So you make it sound like you could have come up with everything you're working on now decades

3:13:24.240 --> 3:13:26.200
 ago, but in reality.

3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:27.840
 Look, two things slowed me down.

3:13:27.840 --> 3:13:33.360
 I mean, one thing that slowed me down was I couldn't figure out how to make it elegant.

3:13:33.360 --> 3:13:35.640
 And that turns out, hypergraphs were the key to that.

3:13:35.640 --> 3:13:40.360
 And that I figured out about less than two years ago now.

3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:45.920
 And the other, I mean, I think, so that was, that was sort of a key thing.

3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:51.520
 Well, okay, so the real embarrassment of this project is that the final structure that

3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:59.960
 we have that is the foundation for this project is basically a kind of an idealized version,

3:13:59.960 --> 3:14:05.520
 a formalized version of the exact same structure that I've used to build computational languages

3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:07.240
 for more than 40 years.

3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:10.200
 But it took me, but I didn't realize that.

3:14:10.200 --> 3:14:11.200
 And you know,

3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:16.440
 And there may be other, so we're focused on physics now, but I mean, that's what the new

3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:17.920
 kind of science is about.

3:14:17.920 --> 3:14:19.360
 Same kind of stuff.

3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:24.400
 And this, in terms of mathematically, the beauty of it, so there could be entire other

3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:30.040
 kind of objects that are useful for like, we're not talking about, you know, machine

3:14:30.040 --> 3:14:34.200
 learning, for example, maybe there's other variants of the hypergraph that are very

3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:35.280
 useful for

3:14:35.280 --> 3:14:39.640
 Well, we'll see whether the multiway graph for a machine learning system is interesting.

3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:40.640
 Okay.

3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:42.360
 Let's leave it at that.

3:14:42.360 --> 3:14:45.000
 That's conversation number three.

3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:46.200
 We're not going to go there right now.

3:14:46.200 --> 3:14:53.360
 But one of the things you've mentioned is the space of all possible rules that we kind

3:14:53.360 --> 3:14:58.760
 of discussed a little bit that, you know, there could be, I guess, the set of possible

3:14:58.760 --> 3:15:00.240
 rules is infinite.

3:15:00.240 --> 3:15:01.240
 Right.

3:15:01.240 --> 3:15:06.440
 Well, so here's, here's the big sort of one of the conundrums that, that I'm kind of trying

3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:12.520
 to deal with is let's say we think we found the rule for the universe and we say, here

3:15:12.520 --> 3:15:14.280
 it is, you know, write it down.

3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:15.880
 It's a little tiny thing.

3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:18.060
 And then we say, gosh, that's really weird.

3:15:18.060 --> 3:15:20.040
 Why did we get that one?

3:15:20.040 --> 3:15:21.040
 Right.

3:15:21.040 --> 3:15:25.600
 And then we're in this whole situation because let's say it's fairly simple.

3:15:25.600 --> 3:15:30.480
 How did we come up with the winners getting one of the simple possible universe rules?

3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:33.640
 Why didn't we get some incredibly complicated rule?

3:15:33.640 --> 3:15:35.360
 Why did we get one of the simpler ones?

3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:39.240
 And that's a thing which, you know, in the history of science, you know, the whole sort

3:15:39.240 --> 3:15:44.240
 of story of Copernicus and so on was, you know, we used to think the Earth was the center

3:15:44.240 --> 3:15:46.360
 of the universe, but now we find out it's not.

3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:50.800
 And we're actually just in some, you know, random corner of some random galaxy out in

3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:51.800
 this big universe.

3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:53.960
 There's nothing special about us.

3:15:53.960 --> 3:16:00.520
 So if we get, you know, universe number 317 out of all the infinite number of possibilities,

3:16:00.520 --> 3:16:02.360
 how do we get something that small and simple?

3:16:02.360 --> 3:16:03.360
 Right.

3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:04.680
 So I was very confused by this.

3:16:04.680 --> 3:16:06.880
 And it's like, what are we going to say about this?

3:16:06.880 --> 3:16:08.680
 How are we going to explain this?

3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:11.720
 And I thought it was, might be one of these things where you just, you know, you can get

3:16:11.720 --> 3:16:15.760
 it to the threshold and then you find out its rule number such and such, and you just

3:16:15.760 --> 3:16:17.440
 have no idea why it's like that.

3:16:17.440 --> 3:16:18.440
 Yeah.

3:16:18.440 --> 3:16:19.440
 Okay.

3:16:19.440 --> 3:16:21.880
 So then I realized it's actually more bizarre than that.

3:16:21.880 --> 3:16:22.880
 Okay.

3:16:22.880 --> 3:16:25.080
 So we talked about multiway graphs.

3:16:25.080 --> 3:16:30.400
 We talked about this idea that you take these underlying transformation rules on these hypergraphs

3:16:30.400 --> 3:16:34.800
 and you apply them wherever the rule can apply, you apply it.

3:16:34.800 --> 3:16:37.240
 And that makes this whole multiway graph of possibilities.

3:16:37.240 --> 3:16:38.240
 Okay.

3:16:38.240 --> 3:16:40.200
 So let's go a little bit weirder.

3:16:40.200 --> 3:16:45.800
 Let's say that at every place, not only do you apply a particular rule in all possible

3:16:45.800 --> 3:16:50.680
 ways it can apply, but you will apply all possible rules in all possible ways they can

3:16:50.680 --> 3:16:51.680
 apply.

3:16:51.680 --> 3:16:53.920
 As you say, that's just crazy.

3:16:53.920 --> 3:16:54.920
 That's way too complicated.

3:16:54.920 --> 3:16:57.520
 You're never going to be able to conclude on a thing.

3:16:57.520 --> 3:16:58.520
 Okay.

3:16:58.520 --> 3:17:00.560
 However, it turns out that.

3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:03.040
 Don't tell me there's some kind of invariance.

3:17:03.040 --> 3:17:04.040
 Yeah.

3:17:04.040 --> 3:17:05.040
 Yeah.

3:17:05.040 --> 3:17:06.520
 So what happens is.

3:17:06.520 --> 3:17:08.240
 And that would be amazing.

3:17:08.240 --> 3:17:09.240
 Right.

3:17:09.240 --> 3:17:10.240
 Okay.

3:17:10.240 --> 3:17:14.520
 So this thing that you get is this kind of rural multiway graph, this multiway graph that

3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:20.000
 is a branching of rules as well as a branching of possible applications of rules.

3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:22.600
 This thing has causal invariance.

3:17:22.600 --> 3:17:25.440
 It's an inevitable feature that it shows causal invariance.

3:17:25.440 --> 3:17:29.760
 And that means that you can take different reference frames, different ways of slicing

3:17:29.760 --> 3:17:34.000
 this thing and they will all in some sense be equivalent.

3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:37.520
 If you make the right translation, they will be equivalent.

3:17:37.520 --> 3:17:38.520
 So okay.

3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:39.520
 Yeah.

3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:40.520
 The basic point here is.

3:17:40.520 --> 3:17:43.160
 If that's true, that would be beautiful.

3:17:43.160 --> 3:17:44.160
 It is true.

3:17:44.160 --> 3:17:45.160
 And it is beautiful.

3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:47.120
 So you, it's not just an intuition.

3:17:47.120 --> 3:17:48.120
 There is some.

3:17:48.120 --> 3:17:49.120
 No, no, no.

3:17:49.120 --> 3:17:53.800
 There's real mathematics behind this and it's, it is, it is okay.

3:17:53.800 --> 3:17:54.800
 So here's.

3:17:54.800 --> 3:17:55.800
 Yeah.

3:17:55.800 --> 3:17:56.800
 That would be amazing.

3:17:56.800 --> 3:17:57.800
 That's amazing.

3:17:57.800 --> 3:17:58.800
 Right.

3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:01.560
 So by the way, I mean, the mathematics that's connected to is the mathematics of higher

3:18:01.560 --> 3:18:06.040
 category theory and group points and things like this, which I've always been afraid of.

3:18:06.040 --> 3:18:10.120
 But now I'm, I'm, I'm finally wrapping my arms around it.

3:18:10.120 --> 3:18:16.320
 But it's also related to, it also relates to computational complexity theory.

3:18:16.320 --> 3:18:20.400
 It's also deeply related to the P versus NP problem and other things like this.

3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:24.040
 Again, seems completely bizarre that these things are connected, but here's why it's

3:18:24.040 --> 3:18:25.040
 connected.

3:18:25.040 --> 3:18:27.960
 The, this space of all possible.

3:18:27.960 --> 3:18:28.960
 Okay.

3:18:28.960 --> 3:18:32.200
 So a Turing machine, very simple model of computation.

3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:36.520
 You know, you just got a, this tape where you write down, you know, ones and zeros or

3:18:36.520 --> 3:18:41.040
 something on the tape and you have this, this rule that says, you know, you, you change

3:18:41.040 --> 3:18:45.000
 the number, you move the head of the, on the tape, et cetera, you have a definite rule

3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:46.000
 for doing that.

3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:50.200
 A deterministic Turing machine just does that deterministically.

3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:53.600
 Given the configuration of the tape, it will always do the same thing.

3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:59.200
 A non deterministic Turing machine can have different choices that it makes at every step.

3:18:59.200 --> 3:19:07.240
 And so, you know, you know, this stuff, you probably teach this stuff, the, it, you know,

3:19:07.240 --> 3:19:11.840
 so a non deterministic Turing machine has the set of branching possibilities, which

3:19:11.840 --> 3:19:14.040
 is in fact, one of these multi way graphs.

3:19:14.040 --> 3:19:19.880
 And in fact, if you say, imagine the extremely non deterministic Turing machine, the Turing

3:19:19.880 --> 3:19:26.760
 machine that can just do, that takes any possible rule at each step, that is this real multi

3:19:26.760 --> 3:19:32.160
 way graph, the set of, the set of trans, the set of possible histories of that extreme

3:19:32.160 --> 3:19:36.240
 non deterministic Turing machine is a Rulial multi way graph.

3:19:36.240 --> 3:19:38.240
 Your, what term are you using?

3:19:38.240 --> 3:19:39.240
 Rulial.

3:19:39.240 --> 3:19:40.240
 Rulial.

3:19:40.240 --> 3:19:41.240
 It's a weird word.

3:19:41.240 --> 3:19:42.240
 Yeah.

3:19:42.240 --> 3:19:43.240
 It's a weird word, right?

3:19:43.240 --> 3:19:44.240
 Rulial.

3:19:44.240 --> 3:19:45.240
 You know, multi way graph.

3:19:45.240 --> 3:19:46.240
 Okay.

3:19:46.240 --> 3:19:47.240
 So this, so that.

3:19:47.240 --> 3:19:52.040
 I'm trying to think of, I'm trying to think of the space of rules.

3:19:52.040 --> 3:19:54.360
 These are basic transformations.

3:19:54.360 --> 3:19:55.920
 So in a Turing machine.

3:19:55.920 --> 3:20:01.400
 It's like it says, move left, move, you know, if it's a one, if it's a black square under

3:20:01.400 --> 3:20:05.080
 the head, move left and right to green square.

3:20:05.080 --> 3:20:06.080
 That's a rule.

3:20:06.080 --> 3:20:07.080
 That's a very basic rule.

3:20:07.080 --> 3:20:12.280
 But I'm trying to see the rules on the hypergraphs, how rich of the programs can they be, or

3:20:12.280 --> 3:20:15.480
 do they all ultimately just map into something simple?

3:20:15.480 --> 3:20:19.920
 Yeah, they're all, I mean, hypergraphs, that's another layer of complexity on this whole

3:20:19.920 --> 3:20:20.920
 thing.

3:20:20.920 --> 3:20:24.080
 You can, you can think about these in transformations of hypergraphs, but Turing machines a little

3:20:24.080 --> 3:20:25.080
 bit.

3:20:25.080 --> 3:20:26.080
 Turing machines, okay.

3:20:26.080 --> 3:20:27.080
 Right.

3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:28.080
 They're a lot simpler.

3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:32.800
 So if you look at these extreme nondeterministic Turing machines, you're mapping out all the

3:20:32.800 --> 3:20:37.840
 possible nondeterministic paths that the Turing machine can follow.

3:20:37.840 --> 3:20:43.200
 And if you ask the question, can you reach, okay, so, so a deterministic Turing machine

3:20:43.200 --> 3:20:44.920
 follows a single path.

3:20:44.920 --> 3:20:50.840
 The nondeterministic Turing machine fills out this whole sort of ball of possibilities.

3:20:50.840 --> 3:20:56.320
 And so then the P versus MP problem ends up being questions about, and we haven't completely

3:20:56.320 --> 3:21:01.280
 figured out all the details of this, but it's basically has to do with questions about the

3:21:01.280 --> 3:21:06.000
 growth of that ball relative to what happens with individual paths and so on.

3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:09.800
 So essentially there's a geometrization of the P versus MP problem that comes out of

3:21:09.800 --> 3:21:10.800
 this.

3:21:10.800 --> 3:21:11.800
 That's a sideshow.

3:21:11.800 --> 3:21:12.800
 Okay.

3:21:12.800 --> 3:21:20.000
 The main, the main event here is the statement that you can look at this multi way graph

3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:24.440
 where the branches correspond not just to different applications of a single rule, but

3:21:24.440 --> 3:21:27.480
 to different applications, to applications of different rules.

3:21:27.480 --> 3:21:28.480
 Okay.

3:21:28.480 --> 3:21:35.640
 And that then that when you say, I'm going to be an observer embedded in that system,

3:21:35.640 --> 3:21:38.960
 and I'm going to try and make sense of what's going on in the system.

3:21:38.960 --> 3:21:43.240
 And to do that, I essentially am picking a reference frame.

3:21:43.240 --> 3:21:49.360
 And that turns out to be, well, okay, so the way this comes out essentially is the reference

3:21:49.360 --> 3:21:55.560
 frame you pick is the rule that you infer is what's going on in the universe.

3:21:55.560 --> 3:22:01.440
 Even though all possible rules are being run, although all those possible rules are in a

3:22:01.440 --> 3:22:04.720
 sense giving the same answer because of causal invariance.

3:22:04.720 --> 3:22:08.560
 But what you see will be, could be completely different.

3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:12.760
 If you pick different reference frames, you essentially have a different description language

3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:14.520
 for describing the universe.

3:22:14.520 --> 3:22:15.520
 Okay.

3:22:15.520 --> 3:22:17.360
 So how does that, what does this really mean in practice?

3:22:17.360 --> 3:22:22.440
 So imagine there's us, we think about the universe in terms of space and time, and we

3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:25.120
 have various kinds of description models and so on.

3:22:25.120 --> 3:22:29.160
 Now let's imagine the friendly aliens, for example, right?

3:22:29.160 --> 3:22:31.080
 How do they describe their universe?

3:22:31.080 --> 3:22:36.000
 Well, you know, our description of the universe probably is affected by the fact that, you

3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:40.360
 know, we are about the size we are, you know, a meter ish tall, so to speak.

3:22:40.360 --> 3:22:45.360
 We have brain processing speeds about the speeds we have, we're not the size of planets,

3:22:45.360 --> 3:22:48.680
 for example, where the speed of light really would matter.

3:22:48.680 --> 3:22:52.160
 You know, in our everyday life, the speed of light doesn't really matter.

3:22:52.160 --> 3:22:55.280
 Everything can be, you know, the fact that the speed of light is finite is irrelevant.

3:22:55.280 --> 3:22:56.800
 It could as well be infinite.

3:22:56.800 --> 3:22:58.560
 We wouldn't make any difference.

3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:01.400
 You know, it affects the ping times on the internet.

3:23:01.400 --> 3:23:06.120
 That's about the level of how we notice the speed of light.

3:23:06.120 --> 3:23:09.600
 In our sort of everyday existence, we don't really notice it.

3:23:09.600 --> 3:23:15.000
 And so we have a way of describing the universe that's based on our sensory, you know, our

3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:20.920
 senses, these days, also on the mathematics we've constructed and so on.

3:23:20.920 --> 3:23:24.280
 But the realization is, it's not the only way to do it.

3:23:24.280 --> 3:23:30.840
 There will be completely utterly incoherent descriptions of the universe, which correspond

3:23:30.840 --> 3:23:34.360
 to different reference frames in this sort of rural space.

3:23:34.360 --> 3:23:35.360
 In the rural space.

3:23:35.360 --> 3:23:36.360
 That's fascinating.

3:23:36.360 --> 3:23:39.800
 So we have some kind of reference frame in this rural space.

3:23:39.800 --> 3:23:40.800
 Right.

3:23:40.800 --> 3:23:45.720
 That's why we are attributing this rule to the universe.

3:23:45.720 --> 3:23:49.520
 So in other words, when we say, why is it this rule and not another?

3:23:49.520 --> 3:23:54.720
 The answer is just, you know, shine the light back on us, so to speak.

3:23:54.720 --> 3:23:58.520
 It's because of the reference frame that we've picked in our way of understanding what's

3:23:58.520 --> 3:24:02.480
 happening in this sort of space of all possible rules and so on.

3:24:02.480 --> 3:24:12.600
 But also in the space from this reference frame, because of the royal, the invariance,

3:24:12.600 --> 3:24:19.960
 that simple, that the rule on which the universe, with which you can run the universe, might

3:24:19.960 --> 3:24:21.240
 as well be simple.

3:24:21.240 --> 3:24:22.240
 Yes.

3:24:22.240 --> 3:24:23.240
 Yes.

3:24:23.240 --> 3:24:24.240
 Okay.

3:24:24.240 --> 3:24:25.240
 So here's another point.

3:24:25.240 --> 3:24:30.440
 So this is again, these are a little bit mind twisting in some ways, but the, okay, another

3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:36.520
 thing that's sort of we know from computation is this idea of computation universality,

3:24:36.520 --> 3:24:41.360
 the fact that given that we have a program that runs on one kind of computer, we can

3:24:41.360 --> 3:24:45.400
 as well, you know, we can convert it to run on any other kind of computer.

3:24:45.400 --> 3:24:48.000
 We can emulate one kind of computer with another.

3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:53.000
 So that might lead you to say, well, you think you have the rule for the universe, but you

3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:58.160
 might as well be running it on a Turing machine because we know we can emulate any computational

3:24:58.160 --> 3:25:01.000
 rule on any kind of machine.

3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:03.840
 And that's essentially the same thing that's being said here.

3:25:03.840 --> 3:25:10.440
 That is, that what we're doing is we're saying these different interpretations of physics

3:25:10.440 --> 3:25:16.440
 correspond to essentially running physics on different underlying, you know, thinking

3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:20.200
 about the physics as running in different with different underlying rules as if different

3:25:20.200 --> 3:25:23.160
 underlying computers were running them.

3:25:23.160 --> 3:25:27.680
 And but because of computation universality or more accurately because of this principle

3:25:27.680 --> 3:25:33.680
 of computational equivalence thing of mine, there's that they are.

3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:35.880
 These things are ultimately equivalent.

3:25:35.880 --> 3:25:40.320
 So the only thing that is the ultimate fact about the universe, the ultimate fact that

3:25:40.320 --> 3:25:43.840
 doesn't depend on any of these, you know, we don't have to talk about specific rules,

3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:48.640
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, the ultimate fact is the universe is computational.

3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:54.480
 And it is the the things that happen in the universe are the kinds of computations that

3:25:54.480 --> 3:25:57.640
 the principle of computational equivalence says should happen.

3:25:57.640 --> 3:26:01.680
 Now that might sound like you're not really saying anything there.

3:26:01.680 --> 3:26:08.840
 But you are because you can you could in principle have a hyper computer that things that take

3:26:08.840 --> 3:26:12.240
 an ordinary computer an infinite time to do the hyper computer can just say, oh, I know

3:26:12.240 --> 3:26:13.640
 the answer.

3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:15.880
 It's this immediately.

3:26:15.880 --> 3:26:19.800
 What this is saying is the universe is not a hyper computer.

3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:24.200
 It's not simpler than a an ordinary Turing machine type computer.

3:26:24.200 --> 3:26:28.200
 It's exactly like an ordinary Turing machine type computer.

3:26:28.200 --> 3:26:33.800
 And so that's the that's in the end, the sort of net net conclusion is that's the thing

3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:38.200
 that is the sort of the hard immovable fact about the universe.

3:26:38.200 --> 3:26:43.640
 That's sort of the the fundamental principle of the universe is that it is computational

3:26:43.640 --> 3:26:47.360
 and not hyper computational and not sort of infra computational.

3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:50.640
 It is this level of computational ability.

3:26:50.640 --> 3:26:56.240
 And it's it kind of has that sort of the the core fact.

3:26:56.240 --> 3:27:01.720
 But now, you know, this this idea that you can have these different kind of rural reference

3:27:01.720 --> 3:27:05.600
 frames, these different description languages for the universe.

3:27:05.600 --> 3:27:10.240
 It makes me, you know, I used to think, OK, you know, imagine the aliens, imagine the

3:27:10.240 --> 3:27:14.800
 extraterrestrial intelligence thing, you know, at least they experience the same physics.

3:27:14.800 --> 3:27:15.800
 Right.

3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:19.360
 And now I've realized it isn't true that they have a different rural frame.

3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:21.200
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:27.040
 They can end up with a a a description of the universe that is utterly, utterly incoherent

3:27:27.040 --> 3:27:28.040
 with ours.

3:27:28.040 --> 3:27:29.040
 Yeah.

3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:32.400
 And that's also interesting in terms of how we think about, well, intelligence, the nature

3:27:32.400 --> 3:27:35.760
 of intelligence and so on, you know, I'm I'm fond of the quote, you know, the weather

3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:40.560
 has a mind of its own, because these are, you know, these are sort of computationally

3:27:40.560 --> 3:27:46.760
 that that system is computationally equivalent to the system that is our brains and so on.

3:27:46.760 --> 3:27:50.920
 And what's different is we don't have a way to understand, you know, what the weather

3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:52.520
 is trying to do, so to speak.

3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:54.960
 We have a story about what's happening in our brains.

3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:57.880
 We don't have a sort of connection to what's happening there.

3:27:57.880 --> 3:28:06.240
 So we actually, it's funny, last time we talked maybe over a year ago, we talked about how

3:28:06.240 --> 3:28:10.000
 it was more based on your work with a rival.

3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:15.240
 We talked about how would we communicate with alien intelligence is can you maybe comment

3:28:15.240 --> 3:28:21.440
 on how we might, how the Wolfram Physics Project changed your view of how we might be able

3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:23.360
 to communicate with alien intelligence?

3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:30.920
 Like if they showed up, is it possible that because of our comprehension of the physics

3:28:30.920 --> 3:28:36.160
 of the world might be completely different, we would just not be able to communicate at

3:28:36.160 --> 3:28:37.160
 all?

3:28:37.160 --> 3:28:41.560
 Here's the thing, you know, intelligence is everywhere.

3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:45.640
 The fact this idea that there's this notion of, oh, there's going to be this amazing extraterrestrial

3:28:45.640 --> 3:28:50.200
 intelligence and it's going to be this unique thing, it's just not true.

3:28:50.200 --> 3:28:51.200
 It's the same thing.

3:28:51.200 --> 3:28:55.360
 You know, I think people will realize this about the time when people decide that artificial

3:28:55.360 --> 3:29:01.240
 intelligences are kind of just natural things that are like human intelligences.

3:29:01.240 --> 3:29:07.600
 They'll realize that extraterrestrial intelligences or intelligences associated with physical systems

3:29:07.600 --> 3:29:09.920
 and so on, it's all the same kind of thing.

3:29:09.920 --> 3:29:10.920
 It's ultimately computation.

3:29:10.920 --> 3:29:12.160
 It's all the same.

3:29:12.160 --> 3:29:13.160
 It's all just computation.

3:29:13.160 --> 3:29:17.200
 And the issue is, can you, are you sort of inside it?

3:29:17.200 --> 3:29:19.240
 Are you thinking about it?

3:29:19.240 --> 3:29:23.320
 Do you have sort of a story you're telling yourself about it?

3:29:23.320 --> 3:29:27.640
 And you know, the weather could have a story it's telling itself about what it's doing.

3:29:27.640 --> 3:29:32.480
 We just, it's utterly incoherent with the stories that we tell ourselves based on how

3:29:32.480 --> 3:29:33.480
 our brains work.

3:29:33.480 --> 3:29:38.720
 I mean, ultimately, it must be a question whether we can align.

3:29:38.720 --> 3:29:39.720
 Exactly.

3:29:39.720 --> 3:29:44.240
 Align with the kind of intelligence that's in the systematic way of doing it.

3:29:44.240 --> 3:29:45.240
 Right.

3:29:45.240 --> 3:29:48.880
 So the question is in the space of all possible intelligences, what's the, how do you think

3:29:48.880 --> 3:29:54.800
 about the distance between description languages for one intelligence versus another?

3:29:54.800 --> 3:29:57.360
 And needless to say, I have thought about this.

3:29:57.360 --> 3:30:03.120
 And you know, I don't have a great answer yet, but I think that's a thing where there

3:30:03.120 --> 3:30:06.360
 will be things that can be said and there'll be things that where you can sort of start

3:30:06.360 --> 3:30:14.280
 to characterize, you know, what is the translation distance between this, you know, version of

3:30:14.280 --> 3:30:18.880
 the universe or this, you know, kind of set of computational rules and this other one.

3:30:18.880 --> 3:30:23.680
 In fact, okay, so this is a, you know, there's this idea of algorithmic information theory.

3:30:23.680 --> 3:30:28.960
 There's this question of sort of what is the, when you have some something, what is the

3:30:28.960 --> 3:30:33.440
 sort of shortest description you can make of it, where that description could be saying,

3:30:33.440 --> 3:30:36.600
 run this program to get the thing, right?

3:30:36.600 --> 3:30:46.240
 So I'm pretty sure that, that the, that there will be a physicalization of the idea of algorithmic

3:30:46.240 --> 3:30:53.240
 information and that, okay, this is again a little bit bizarre, but so I mentioned that

3:30:53.240 --> 3:30:57.720
 there's the speed of light, maximum speed of information transmission in physical space.

3:30:57.720 --> 3:31:01.480
 There's a maximum speed of information transmission in branch shield space, which is a maximum

3:31:01.480 --> 3:31:03.080
 entanglement speed.

3:31:03.080 --> 3:31:08.680
 There's a maximum speed of information transmission in rural space, which has to do with a maximum

3:31:08.680 --> 3:31:14.560
 speed of translation between different description languages.

3:31:14.560 --> 3:31:17.520
 And again, I'm not fully wrapped my brain around this one.

3:31:17.520 --> 3:31:21.280
 Yeah, that one just blows my mind to think about that, but that starts getting closer

3:31:21.280 --> 3:31:24.920
 to the, yeah, the, the intelligence thing.

3:31:24.920 --> 3:31:25.920
 It's kind of a physicalization, right.

3:31:25.920 --> 3:31:30.000
 It's a, and it's also a physicalization of, of algorithmic information.

3:31:30.000 --> 3:31:33.520
 And I think there's probably a connection between, I mean, there's probably a connection

3:31:33.520 --> 3:31:38.360
 between the notion of energy and some of these things, which again, I, I, you know, hadn't

3:31:38.360 --> 3:31:39.360
 seen all this coming.

3:31:39.360 --> 3:31:43.560
 I've always been a little bit resistant to the idea of connecting physical energy to

3:31:43.560 --> 3:31:47.280
 things in, in, in computation theory, but I think that's probably coming.

3:31:47.280 --> 3:31:51.600
 And that's essentially at the core with the, the physics project is that you're connecting

3:31:51.600 --> 3:31:54.680
 information theory with physics.

3:31:54.680 --> 3:31:59.480
 Yeah, it's computation and computation with our physical universe.

3:31:59.480 --> 3:32:00.480
 Yeah, right.

3:32:00.480 --> 3:32:04.880
 I mean, the fact that our physical universe is, is, right, that we can think of it as

3:32:04.880 --> 3:32:09.720
 a computation and that we can have discussions like, you know, the theory of the physical

3:32:09.720 --> 3:32:17.200
 universe is the same kind of a theory as the P versus MP problem and so on is, is really,

3:32:17.200 --> 3:32:19.160
 you know, I think that's really interesting.

3:32:19.160 --> 3:32:24.320
 And the fact that, well, okay, so this, this kind of brings me to one, one more thing that

3:32:24.320 --> 3:32:29.760
 I have to, in terms of this sort of unification of different ideas, which is metamathematics.

3:32:29.760 --> 3:32:30.760
 Yeah, let's talk about that.

3:32:30.760 --> 3:32:31.840
 You mentioned that earlier.

3:32:31.840 --> 3:32:37.040
 What the heck is metamathematics and so here's, here's what, here's, okay.

3:32:37.040 --> 3:32:39.480
 So what is mathematics?

3:32:39.480 --> 3:32:45.960
 Mathematics sort of at a lowest level, one thinks of mathematics as you have certain

3:32:45.960 --> 3:32:52.040
 axioms, you say, you know, you say things like X plus Y is the same as Y plus X.

3:32:52.040 --> 3:32:55.440
 That's an axiom about addition.

3:32:55.440 --> 3:32:59.960
 And then you say we got these axioms and we, and from these axioms, we derive all these

3:32:59.960 --> 3:33:05.360
 theorems that fill up the literature of mathematics, the activity of mathematicians is to derive

3:33:05.360 --> 3:33:07.120
 all these theorems.

3:33:07.120 --> 3:33:10.440
 Actually the axioms of mathematics are very small.

3:33:10.440 --> 3:33:14.960
 You can fit, you know, when I did my new kind of science book, I fit all of the standard

3:33:14.960 --> 3:33:18.960
 axioms of mathematics on basically a page and a half.

3:33:18.960 --> 3:33:19.960
 Not much stuff.

3:33:19.960 --> 3:33:25.080
 It's like a very simple rule from which all of mathematics arises.

3:33:25.080 --> 3:33:31.720
 The way it works though is a little different from the way things work in sort of a computation

3:33:31.720 --> 3:33:34.760
 because in mathematics what you're interested in is a proof.

3:33:34.760 --> 3:33:40.600
 And the proof says from here, you can use from this expression, for example, you can

3:33:40.600 --> 3:33:43.160
 use these axioms to get to this other expression.

3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:45.320
 So that proves these two things are equal.

3:33:45.320 --> 3:33:49.400
 Okay, so we can begin to see how this is going to work.

3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:53.560
 It's going to, what happened is there are paths in metamathematical space.

3:33:53.560 --> 3:33:58.840
 So what happens is each two different ways to look at it, you can just look at it as

3:33:58.840 --> 3:34:03.200
 mathematical expressions or you can look at it as mathematical statements, postulates

3:34:03.200 --> 3:34:04.200
 or something.

3:34:04.200 --> 3:34:11.620
 But either way, you think of these things and they are connected by these axioms.

3:34:11.620 --> 3:34:16.520
 So in other words, you have some fact, you, or you have some expression, you apply this

3:34:16.520 --> 3:34:19.080
 axiom, you get some other expression.

3:34:19.080 --> 3:34:23.880
 And in general, given some expression, there may be many possible different expressions

3:34:23.880 --> 3:34:24.960
 you can get.

3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:27.600
 You basically build up a multiway graph.

3:34:27.600 --> 3:34:33.680
 And a proof is a path through the multiway graph that goes from one thing to another

3:34:33.680 --> 3:34:34.680
 thing.

3:34:34.680 --> 3:34:38.400
 The path tells you how did you get from one thing to the other thing.

3:34:38.400 --> 3:34:40.800
 It's the story of how you got from this to that.

3:34:40.800 --> 3:34:44.760
 The theorem is the thing at one end is equal to the thing at the other end.

3:34:44.760 --> 3:34:48.720
 The proof is the path you go down to get from one thing to the other.

3:34:48.720 --> 3:34:53.680
 You mentioned that Gadel's incompleteness theorem is the natural, it fits naturally there,

3:34:53.680 --> 3:34:54.680
 how does it fit?

3:34:54.680 --> 3:34:55.680
 Yeah.

3:34:55.680 --> 3:34:59.360
 So what happens there is that the Gadel's theorem is basically saying that there are

3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:01.400
 paths of infinite length.

3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:03.160
 That is that there's no upper bound.

3:35:03.160 --> 3:35:06.520
 If you know these two things, you say, I'm trying to get from here to here, how long

3:35:06.520 --> 3:35:08.000
 do I have to go?

3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:12.040
 You say, well, I've looked at all the paths of length 10, somebody says, that's not good

3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:13.040
 enough.

3:35:13.040 --> 3:35:15.080
 That path might be of length a billion.

3:35:15.080 --> 3:35:17.440
 And there's no upper bound on how long that path is.

3:35:17.440 --> 3:35:19.840
 And that's what leads to the incompleteness theorem.

3:35:19.840 --> 3:35:26.720
 So I mean, the thing that is kind of an emerging idea is you can start asking, what's the analog

3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:29.880
 Weinstein's equations in metamathematical space?

3:35:29.880 --> 3:35:33.320
 What's the analog of a black hole in metamathematical space?

3:35:33.320 --> 3:35:34.320
 What's the hope?

3:35:34.320 --> 3:35:35.320
 Yeah.

3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:37.320
 It's fascinating to model all the mathematics in this way.

3:35:37.320 --> 3:35:38.520
 Well, so here's what it is.

3:35:38.520 --> 3:35:40.440
 This is mathematics in bulk.

3:35:40.440 --> 3:35:44.040
 So human mathematicians have made a few million theorems.

3:35:44.040 --> 3:35:48.680
 They published a few million theorems, but imagine the infinite future of mathematics.

3:35:48.680 --> 3:35:52.520
 Apply something to mathematics that mathematics likes to apply to other things.

3:35:52.520 --> 3:35:53.680
 Take a limit.

3:35:53.680 --> 3:35:56.440
 What is the limit of the infinite future of mathematics?

3:35:56.440 --> 3:35:57.680
 What does it look like?

3:35:57.680 --> 3:35:59.640
 What is the continuum limit of mathematics?

3:35:59.640 --> 3:36:03.880
 What is the, as you just fill in more and more and more theorems, what does it look

3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:04.880
 like?

3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:05.880
 What does it do?

3:36:05.880 --> 3:36:07.520
 How does, what kinds of conclusions can you make?

3:36:07.520 --> 3:36:11.120
 So for example, one thing I've just been doing is taking Euclid.

3:36:11.120 --> 3:36:12.880
 So Euclid, very impressive.

3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:14.320
 He had 10 axioms.

3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:17.600
 He derived 465 theorems, okay?

3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:24.280
 His book, you know, that was, was the sort of defining book of mathematics for 2000 years.

3:36:24.280 --> 3:36:29.640
 So you can actually map out, and I actually did this 20 years ago, but I've done it more

3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:30.800
 seriously now.

3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:34.880
 You can map out the theorem dependency of those 465 theorems.

3:36:34.880 --> 3:36:39.880
 So from the axioms, you grow this graph, it's actually a multiway graph, of how all these

3:36:39.880 --> 3:36:42.520
 theorems get proved from other theorems.

3:36:42.520 --> 3:36:46.760
 And so you can ask questions about, you know, you can ask things like, what's the hardest

3:36:46.760 --> 3:36:47.760
 theorem in Euclid?

3:36:47.760 --> 3:36:51.040
 The answer is the hardest theorem is that there are five platonic solids.

3:36:51.040 --> 3:36:52.960
 That turns out to be the hardest theorem in Euclid.

3:36:52.960 --> 3:36:55.440
 That's actually his, his last theorem in all his books.

3:36:55.440 --> 3:36:56.440
 That's the final point.

3:36:56.440 --> 3:36:57.440
 What's the hardness?

3:36:57.440 --> 3:36:58.440
 The distance you have to travel?

3:36:58.440 --> 3:36:59.440
 Yeah.

3:36:59.440 --> 3:37:03.800
 Let's say it's 33 steps from the, the longest path in the graph is 33 steps.

3:37:03.800 --> 3:37:09.360
 So that's the, there, there's a 33 step path you have to follow to go from the axioms according

3:37:09.360 --> 3:37:13.680
 to Euclid's proofs to the statement there are five platonic solids.

3:37:13.680 --> 3:37:14.680
 So, so okay.

3:37:14.680 --> 3:37:22.240
 So then, then, then the question is in, what does it mean if you have this map?

3:37:22.240 --> 3:37:23.240
 Okay.

3:37:23.240 --> 3:37:28.680
 So in a sense, this metamathematical space is the infrastructural space of all possible

3:37:28.680 --> 3:37:31.760
 theorems that you could prove in mathematics.

3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:34.440
 That's the geometry of metamathematics.

3:37:34.440 --> 3:37:39.840
 There's also the geography of mathematics that is where did people choose to live in

3:37:39.840 --> 3:37:40.840
 space?

3:37:40.840 --> 3:37:44.720
 And that's what, for example, exploring the sort of empirical metamathematics of Euclid

3:37:44.720 --> 3:37:45.720
 is doing that.

3:37:45.720 --> 3:37:49.440
 See, you could put each individual like human mathematician, you could embed them into that

3:37:49.440 --> 3:37:50.440
 space.

3:37:50.440 --> 3:37:51.440
 I mean, they, they kind of live.

3:37:51.440 --> 3:37:52.440
 They, they represent a path.

3:37:52.440 --> 3:37:53.440
 The little path.

3:37:53.440 --> 3:37:54.440
 Things they do.

3:37:54.440 --> 3:37:55.440
 Maybe a set of paths.

3:37:55.440 --> 3:37:56.440
 Right.

3:37:56.440 --> 3:37:57.920
 So like a set of axioms that are chosen.

3:37:57.920 --> 3:37:58.920
 Right.

3:37:58.920 --> 3:38:02.120
 So, so for example, here's an example of a thing that I realized.

3:38:02.120 --> 3:38:06.200
 So one of the surprising things about, well, the two surprising facts about math.

3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:09.320
 One is that it's hard and the other is that it's doable.

3:38:09.320 --> 3:38:10.320
 Okay.

3:38:10.320 --> 3:38:12.680
 So first question is, why is math hard?

3:38:12.680 --> 3:38:15.080
 You know, you've got these axioms, they're very small.

3:38:15.080 --> 3:38:17.480
 Why can't you just solve every problem in math easily?

3:38:17.480 --> 3:38:18.880
 Yeah, it's just logic.

3:38:18.880 --> 3:38:19.880
 Right.

3:38:19.880 --> 3:38:20.880
 Yeah.

3:38:20.880 --> 3:38:24.040
 Well, logic happens to be a particular special case that does have certain simplicity to

3:38:24.040 --> 3:38:25.400
 it.

3:38:25.400 --> 3:38:30.440
 But general mathematics, even arithmetic already doesn't have the simplicity that logic has.

3:38:30.440 --> 3:38:31.880
 So why is it hard?

3:38:31.880 --> 3:38:34.560
 Because of computational irreducibility.

3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:35.800
 Right.

3:38:35.800 --> 3:38:39.000
 Because what happens is to know what's true.

3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:43.120
 And this is this whole story about the path you have to follow and how long is the path.

3:38:43.120 --> 3:38:46.360
 And Goethe theorem is the statement, there could be an infant that the path is not a

3:38:46.360 --> 3:38:47.800
 bounded length.

3:38:47.800 --> 3:38:53.040
 But the fact that the path is not always compressible to something tiny is a story of computational

3:38:53.040 --> 3:38:54.560
 irreducibility.

3:38:54.560 --> 3:38:56.920
 So that's, that's why math is hard.

3:38:56.920 --> 3:38:59.680
 Now the next question is, why is math doable?

3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:04.480
 Because it might be the case that most things you care about don't have finite length paths.

3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:08.960
 Most things you care about might be things where you get lost in the sea of computational

3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:12.680
 irreducibility and worse, undecidability.

3:39:12.680 --> 3:39:16.040
 That is, there's just no finite length path that gets you there.

3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:18.880
 You know, why is mathematics doable?

3:39:18.880 --> 3:39:22.520
 You know, Goethe proved his incompleteness theorem in 1931.

3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:25.320
 Most working mathematicians don't really care about it.

3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:29.280
 They just go ahead and do mathematics, even though it could be that the questions they're

3:39:29.280 --> 3:39:31.120
 asking are undecidable.

3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:33.760
 It could have been that Fermat's last theorem is undecidable.

3:39:33.760 --> 3:39:35.200
 It turned out it had a proof.

3:39:35.200 --> 3:39:37.080
 It's a long complicated proof.

3:39:37.080 --> 3:39:40.280
 The twin prime conjecture might be undecidable.

3:39:40.280 --> 3:39:43.160
 The Riemann hypothesis might be undecidable.

3:39:43.160 --> 3:39:48.560
 These things might be, the axioms of mathematics might not be strong enough to reach those

3:39:48.560 --> 3:39:49.560
 statements.

3:39:49.560 --> 3:39:53.160
 It might be the case that depending on what axioms you choose, you can either say that's

3:39:53.160 --> 3:39:54.880
 true or that's not true.

3:39:54.880 --> 3:39:59.600
 And by the way, Fermat's last theorem, it could be a shorter path.

3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:00.600
 Absolutely.

3:40:00.600 --> 3:40:01.600
 Yeah.

3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:06.400
 So the notion of geodesics in mathematical space is a notion of shortest proofs in mathematical

3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:07.400
 space.

3:40:07.400 --> 3:40:12.080
 And that's a, you know, human mathematicians do not find shortest paths, nor do automated

3:40:12.080 --> 3:40:14.040
 theorem provers.

3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:18.720
 But the fact, and by the way, I mean, this stuff is so bizarrely connected.

3:40:18.720 --> 3:40:22.720
 I mean, if you're into automated theorem proving, there are these so called critical

3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:25.040
 pair lemmas in automated theorem proving.

3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:30.080
 Those are precisely the branch pairs in our, that in multiway graphs.

3:40:30.080 --> 3:40:32.800
 Let me just finish on the why mathematics is doable.

3:40:32.800 --> 3:40:33.800
 Oh, yes.

3:40:33.800 --> 3:40:34.800
 The second part.

3:40:34.800 --> 3:40:35.800
 Right.

3:40:35.800 --> 3:40:36.800
 We just know why it's hard.

3:40:36.800 --> 3:40:37.800
 Why is it doable?

3:40:37.800 --> 3:40:38.800
 Right.

3:40:38.800 --> 3:40:39.800
 Why do we not just get lost in undecidability all the time?

3:40:39.800 --> 3:40:40.800
 Yeah.

3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:47.120
 So, and here's another fact is in doing computer experiments and doing experimental mathematics,

3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:49.160
 you do get lost in that way.

3:40:49.160 --> 3:40:54.000
 And you just say, I'm picking a random integer equation.

3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:56.280
 How do I, does it have a solution or not?

3:40:56.280 --> 3:41:01.320
 And you just pick it at random without any human sort of path getting there.

3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:03.400
 Often it's really, really hard.

3:41:03.400 --> 3:41:06.000
 It's really hard to answer those questions when you just pick them up random from the

3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:08.000
 space of possibilities.

3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:12.360
 But what's, what I think is happening is, and that's a case where you just fell off

3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:15.680
 into this ocean of sort of irreducibility and so on.

3:41:15.680 --> 3:41:20.200
 What's happening is human mathematics is a story of building a path.

3:41:20.200 --> 3:41:26.200
 You started off, you're always building out on this path where you are proving things.

3:41:26.200 --> 3:41:30.760
 You've got this proof trajectory and you're basically, the human mathematics is the sort

3:41:30.760 --> 3:41:36.760
 of the exploration of the world along this proof trajectory, so to speak.

3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:44.080
 You're not, you're not just parachuting in from anywhere, you're following Lewis and

3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:45.080
 Clark or whatever.

3:41:45.080 --> 3:41:48.280
 You're actually, you're actually doing the path.

3:41:48.280 --> 3:41:53.040
 And the fact that you are constrained to go along that path is the reason you don't end

3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:54.040
 up with a lot.

3:41:54.040 --> 3:41:57.400
 Every so often you'll see a little piece of undecidability and you'll avoid that part

3:41:57.400 --> 3:41:58.400
 of the path.

3:41:58.400 --> 3:42:02.760
 But that's basically the story of why human mathematics has seemed to be doable.

3:42:02.760 --> 3:42:08.880
 It's a story of exploring these paths that are, by their nature, they have been constructed

3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:12.280
 to be paths that can be followed and so you can follow them further.

3:42:12.280 --> 3:42:15.040
 Now, you know, why is this relevant to anything?

3:42:15.040 --> 3:42:19.560
 So okay, so here's the, my belief.

3:42:19.560 --> 3:42:25.960
 The fact that human mathematics works that way is, I think there's some sort of connections

3:42:25.960 --> 3:42:31.960
 between the way that observers work in physics and the way that the axiom systems of mathematics

3:42:31.960 --> 3:42:36.440
 are set up to make mathematics be doable in that kind of way.

3:42:36.440 --> 3:42:41.760
 And so, in other words, in particular, I think there is an analog of causal invariance,

3:42:41.760 --> 3:42:44.880
 which I think is, and this is again, it's sort of, you know, it's sort of, you know,

3:42:44.880 --> 3:42:50.960
 and sort of the upper reaches of mathematics and stuff that, it's a thing, there's this

3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:56.200
 thing called homotopy type theory, which is an abstract, it's came out of category theory,

3:42:56.200 --> 3:42:58.800
 and it's sort of an abstraction of mathematics.

3:42:58.800 --> 3:43:02.600
 Mathematics itself is an abstraction, but it's an abstraction of the abstraction of

3:43:02.600 --> 3:43:04.100
 mathematics.

3:43:04.100 --> 3:43:10.840
 And there is the thing called the univalence axiom, which is a sort of a key axiom in that

3:43:10.840 --> 3:43:16.480
 set of ideas, and I'm pretty sure the univalence axiom is equivalent to causal invariance.

3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:18.200
 What was the term used again, you know?

3:43:18.200 --> 3:43:19.200
 Univalence.

3:43:19.200 --> 3:43:22.520
 Is that something for somebody like me accessible?

3:43:22.520 --> 3:43:23.520
 Or is this?

3:43:23.520 --> 3:43:25.520
 There's a statement of it that's fairly accessible.

3:43:25.520 --> 3:43:33.440
 I mean, the statement of it is basically it says things which are equivalent can be considered

3:43:33.440 --> 3:43:35.640
 to be identical.

3:43:35.640 --> 3:43:37.640
 In which space?

3:43:37.640 --> 3:43:38.640
 Yeah.

3:43:38.640 --> 3:43:40.120
 It's in higher category.

3:43:40.120 --> 3:43:41.120
 Okay.

3:43:41.120 --> 3:43:42.120
 In category theory.

3:43:42.120 --> 3:43:43.120
 Yeah.

3:43:43.120 --> 3:43:46.240
 Okay, so it's a, but I mean, the thing just to give a sketch of how that works.

3:43:46.240 --> 3:43:52.000
 So category theory is an attempt to idealize, it's an attempt to sort of have a formal theory

3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:55.680
 of mathematics that is at a sort of higher level than mathematics.

3:43:55.680 --> 3:44:01.960
 It's where you just think about these mathematical objects and these categories of objects and

3:44:01.960 --> 3:44:05.400
 these morphisms, these connections between categories.

3:44:05.400 --> 3:44:06.400
 Okay.

3:44:06.400 --> 3:44:12.080
 So it turns out the morphisms in categories, at least weak categories, are very much like

3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:14.920
 the paths in our hypergraphs and things.

3:44:14.920 --> 3:44:18.480
 And it turns out, again, this is where it all gets crazy.

3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:22.080
 I mean, it's the fact that these things are connected is just bizarre.

3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:30.200
 So category theory, our causal graphs are like second order category theory.

3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:34.240
 And it turns out you can take the limits of infinite order category theory.

3:44:34.240 --> 3:44:37.040
 So just give roughly the idea.

3:44:37.040 --> 3:44:39.240
 This is a roughly explainable idea.

3:44:39.240 --> 3:44:45.560
 So a mathematical proof will be a path that says you can get from this thing to this other

3:44:45.560 --> 3:44:46.560
 thing.

3:44:46.560 --> 3:44:48.800
 And here's the path that you get from this thing to this other thing.

3:44:48.800 --> 3:44:54.040
 But in general, there may be many paths, many proofs that get you many different paths that

3:44:54.040 --> 3:44:57.080
 all successfully go from this thing to this other thing.

3:44:57.080 --> 3:44:58.080
 Okay.

3:44:58.080 --> 3:45:03.120
 Now you can define a higher order proof, which is a proof of the equivalence of those proofs.

3:45:03.120 --> 3:45:04.120
 Okay.

3:45:04.120 --> 3:45:07.000
 And so you're saying there's a path between those proofs essentially.

3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:08.000
 Yes.

3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:09.000
 A path between the paths.

3:45:09.000 --> 3:45:10.000
 Yeah.

3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:11.000
 Okay.

3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:12.000
 And so you do that.

3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:13.000
 That's the sort of second order thing.

3:45:13.000 --> 3:45:17.360
 That path between the paths is essentially related to our causal graphs.

3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:18.360
 Wow.

3:45:18.360 --> 3:45:19.360
 Okay.

3:45:19.360 --> 3:45:24.760
 Path between path, between path, between path, the infinite limit.

3:45:24.760 --> 3:45:28.200
 That infinite limit turns out to be our Rulial Multiway System.

3:45:28.200 --> 3:45:29.200
 Yeah.

3:45:29.200 --> 3:45:33.720
 The Rulial, the Rulial Multiway System, that's a fascinating thing both in the physics world

3:45:33.720 --> 3:45:35.960
 and as you're saying, that's fascinating.

3:45:35.960 --> 3:45:39.080
 I'm not sure I've loaded it all in completely, but...

3:45:39.080 --> 3:45:40.280
 Well, I'm not sure I have either.

3:45:40.280 --> 3:45:45.240
 And it may be one of these things where in another five years or something, it's like,

3:45:45.240 --> 3:45:47.680
 this was obvious, but I didn't see it.

3:45:47.680 --> 3:45:51.560
 The thing which is sort of interesting to me is that there's sort of an upper reach

3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:56.000
 of mathematics, of the abstraction of mathematics.

3:45:56.000 --> 3:46:00.240
 This thing, there's this mathematician called growthendeek, who's generally viewed as being

3:46:00.240 --> 3:46:05.120
 sort of one of the most abstract, sort of creator of the most abstract mathematics of

3:46:05.120 --> 3:46:09.560
 1970sish time frame.

3:46:09.560 --> 3:46:14.360
 And one of the things that he constructed with this thing, he called the infinity groupoid.

3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:19.080
 And he has this sort of hypothesis about the inevitable appearance of geometry from essentially

3:46:19.080 --> 3:46:22.240
 logic in the structure of this thing.

3:46:22.240 --> 3:46:26.720
 Well, it turns out this Rulial Multiway System is the infinity groupoid.

3:46:26.720 --> 3:46:33.680
 So it's this limiting object, and this is an instance of that limiting object.

3:46:33.680 --> 3:46:37.880
 So what to me is, I mean, again, I've been always afraid of this kind of mathematics

3:46:37.880 --> 3:46:42.360
 because it seemed incomprehensibly abstract to me.

3:46:42.360 --> 3:46:49.440
 But what I'm sort of excited about with this is that we've sort of concretified the way

3:46:49.440 --> 3:46:55.160
 that you can reach this kind of mathematics, which makes it, well, both seem more relevant

3:46:55.160 --> 3:46:59.600
 and also the fact that that, you know, I don't yet know exactly what mileage we're going

3:46:59.600 --> 3:47:05.160
 to get from using the sort of the apparatus that's been built in those areas of mathematics

3:47:05.160 --> 3:47:06.600
 to analyze what we're doing.

3:47:06.600 --> 3:47:07.600
 But the thing that's

3:47:07.600 --> 3:47:08.600
 So both ways.

3:47:08.600 --> 3:47:09.600
 Yeah, right.

3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:13.360
 What you're doing and using what you're doing computationally to understand that.

3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:14.360
 Right.

3:47:14.360 --> 3:47:18.920
 So for example, the understanding of metamathematical space, one of the reasons I really want to

3:47:18.920 --> 3:47:23.160
 do that is because I want to understand quantum mechanics better.

3:47:23.160 --> 3:47:30.160
 And that what you see, you know, we live that kind of the multiway graph of mathematics

3:47:30.160 --> 3:47:33.200
 because we actually know this is a theorem we've heard of, this is another one we've

3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:34.200
 heard of.

3:47:34.200 --> 3:47:39.000
 We can actually say these are actual things in the world that we relate to, which we can't

3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:43.160
 really do as readily for the physics case.

3:47:43.160 --> 3:47:45.240
 And so it's kind of a way to help my intuition.

3:47:45.240 --> 3:47:49.920
 It's also, you know, there are bizarre things like what's the analog of Einstein's equations

3:47:49.920 --> 3:47:54.720
 in metamathematical space, what's the analog of a black hole, you know, it turns out it

3:47:54.720 --> 3:48:01.600
 looks like not completely sure yet, but there's this notion of nonconstructive proofs in mathematics.

3:48:01.600 --> 3:48:10.520
 And I think those relate to, well, actually, they relate to things related to event horizons.

3:48:10.520 --> 3:48:14.480
 So the fact that you can take ideas from physics, like event horizons.

3:48:14.480 --> 3:48:17.320
 And map them to the same kind of space in metamathematica.

3:48:17.320 --> 3:48:23.920
 So do you think there'll be, do you think you might stumble upon some breakthrough ideas

3:48:23.920 --> 3:48:28.760
 in theorem proving, like for, from the other direction?

3:48:28.760 --> 3:48:29.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:34.680
 No, I mean, what's really nice is that we are using, so this, this absolutely directly

3:48:34.680 --> 3:48:35.680
 maps to theorem proving.

3:48:35.680 --> 3:48:38.600
 So paths and multiway graphs, that's what a theorem prover is trying to do.

3:48:38.600 --> 3:48:40.680
 But I also mean like, like automated theorem.

3:48:40.680 --> 3:48:41.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:48:41.680 --> 3:48:42.680
 That's what, right.

3:48:42.680 --> 3:48:47.100
 So the finding of paths, the finding of shortest paths, or finding of paths at all is what

3:48:47.100 --> 3:48:48.840
 automated theorem provers do.

3:48:48.840 --> 3:48:52.760
 And actually what, what we've been doing, so we've, you know, we've actually been using

3:48:52.760 --> 3:48:58.080
 automated theorem proving both in the physics project to prove things and using that as

3:48:58.080 --> 3:49:00.760
 a way to understand multiway graphs.

3:49:00.760 --> 3:49:05.720
 And because what an automated theorem prover is doing is it's trying to find a path through

3:49:05.720 --> 3:49:07.600
 a multiway graph.

3:49:07.600 --> 3:49:13.480
 And it's critical pair lemmas are precisely little stubs of branch pairs going off into

3:49:13.480 --> 3:49:18.160
 branchial space, and that's, I mean, it's really weird, you know, we have these visualizations

3:49:18.160 --> 3:49:24.240
 in wealth and language of our, of proof graphs from our automated theorem proving system.

3:49:24.240 --> 3:49:25.760
 And they look reminiscent of.

3:49:25.760 --> 3:49:29.400
 Well, it's just bizarre because we made these up a few years ago and they have these little

3:49:29.400 --> 3:49:33.000
 triangle things and they are, they are, we, we didn't quite get it right.

3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:36.200
 We didn't quite get the analogy perfectly right, but it's very close.

3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:39.960
 You know, just to say in terms of the, how these things are connected.

3:49:39.960 --> 3:49:45.320
 So there's another bizarre connection that I have to mention because, because, um, um,

3:49:45.320 --> 3:49:50.880
 which is, uh, which again, we don't fully know, but it's a connection to, uh, uh, something

3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:54.720
 else you might not have thought was in the slightest bit connected, which is distributed

3:49:54.720 --> 3:49:59.080
 blockchain like things that you might figure out that that's, you, you would figure out

3:49:59.080 --> 3:50:02.360
 that that's connected because, because it's a story of distributed computing.

3:50:02.360 --> 3:50:03.360
 Yeah.

3:50:03.360 --> 3:50:06.600
 And the issue, you know, with a blockchain, you're saying there's going to be this one

3:50:06.600 --> 3:50:14.080
 ledger that, that globally says this is what happened in the world, but that's a bad deal.

3:50:14.080 --> 3:50:18.880
 If you've got all these different transactions that are happening and you know, this transaction

3:50:18.880 --> 3:50:24.320
 in country A doesn't have to be reconciled with the transaction in country B, at least

3:50:24.320 --> 3:50:26.320
 not for a while.

3:50:26.320 --> 3:50:31.160
 And that story is just like what happens with our causal graphs.

3:50:31.160 --> 3:50:35.520
 That whole reconciliation thing is just like what happens with light cones and all this

3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:37.800
 stuff, that that's where the cause of variance comes into play.

3:50:37.800 --> 3:50:42.400
 I mean, that, that's, you know, most of your conversations are about physics, but it's

3:50:42.400 --> 3:50:51.560
 kind of funny that this probably and possibly might have even bigger impact and, uh, revolutionary

3:50:51.560 --> 3:50:53.520
 ideas and totally other disciplines.

3:50:53.520 --> 3:50:54.520
 Right.

3:50:54.520 --> 3:50:55.520
 Yeah.

3:50:55.520 --> 3:50:56.520
 Right.

3:50:56.520 --> 3:50:57.520
 So the question is, why is that happening?

3:50:57.520 --> 3:50:58.520
 Right.

3:50:58.520 --> 3:51:01.480
 And the reason it's happening, I've thought about this obviously because I like to think

3:51:01.480 --> 3:51:06.560
 about these meta questions of, you know, what's happening is this model that we have is an

3:51:06.560 --> 3:51:08.160
 incredibly minimal model.

3:51:08.160 --> 3:51:09.160
 Yeah.

3:51:09.160 --> 3:51:12.780
 And once you have an incredibly minimal model, and this happened with cellular automator

3:51:12.780 --> 3:51:16.120
 as well, cellular automator are an incredibly minimal model.

3:51:16.120 --> 3:51:21.200
 And so it's inevitable that it gets you, it's sort of an upstream thing that gets used in

3:51:21.200 --> 3:51:22.800
 lots of different places.

3:51:22.800 --> 3:51:26.400
 And it's like, you know, the fact that it gets used, you know, cellular automator is

3:51:26.400 --> 3:51:29.160
 sort of a minimal model of like, say road traffic flow or something.

3:51:29.160 --> 3:51:32.440
 They're also a minimal model of something in, you know, chemistry, and they're also a

3:51:32.440 --> 3:51:35.960
 minimal model of something in, in epidemiology, right?

3:51:35.960 --> 3:51:39.520
 It's because they're such a simple model that they can, that they apply to all these different

3:51:39.520 --> 3:51:40.520
 things.

3:51:40.520 --> 3:51:46.080
 Similarly, this model that we have with the physics project is, is, is another cellular

3:51:46.080 --> 3:51:50.640
 automator or a minimal model of parallel, of, of basically of parallel computation where

3:51:50.640 --> 3:51:53.040
 you've defined space and time.

3:51:53.040 --> 3:51:57.360
 These models are minimal models where you have not defined space and time.

3:51:57.360 --> 3:52:00.480
 And they have been very hard to understand in the past.

3:52:00.480 --> 3:52:05.600
 But the, I think the, perhaps the most important breakthrough there is the realization that

3:52:05.600 --> 3:52:07.560
 these are models of physics.

3:52:07.560 --> 3:52:11.920
 And therefore that you can use everything that's been developed in physics to get intuition

3:52:11.920 --> 3:52:13.960
 about how things like that work.

3:52:13.960 --> 3:52:18.520
 And that's why you can potentially use ideas from physics to get intuition about how to

3:52:18.520 --> 3:52:20.400
 do parallel computing.

3:52:20.400 --> 3:52:26.440
 And because the underlying model is the same and, but, but we have all of this achievement

3:52:26.440 --> 3:52:27.440
 in physics.

3:52:27.440 --> 3:52:30.040
 I mean, you know, you might say, oh, you've come up with a fundamental theory of physics

3:52:30.040 --> 3:52:33.640
 that throws out what people have done in physics before, but it doesn't.

3:52:33.640 --> 3:52:38.600
 But also the real power is to use what's been done before in physics to apply it in these

3:52:38.600 --> 3:52:39.600
 other places.

3:52:39.600 --> 3:52:40.600
 Yes.

3:52:40.600 --> 3:52:48.200
 And this kind of brings up, I know you probably don't particularly love commenting on the work

3:52:48.200 --> 3:52:49.200
 of others.

3:52:49.200 --> 3:52:52.800
 But let me, let me bring up a couple of personalities just because it's fun and people are curious

3:52:52.800 --> 3:52:53.800
 about it.

3:52:53.800 --> 3:53:00.600
 So there's Sabine Hassenfelder, I don't know if you're familiar with her.

3:53:00.600 --> 3:53:07.040
 She, she wrote this book that I need to read, but it based, I forget what the title is,

3:53:07.040 --> 3:53:12.880
 but it's beauty leads us astray in physics is a subtitle or something like that, which

3:53:12.880 --> 3:53:19.360
 so much about what we're talking about now, like this simplification is a, to us humans

3:53:19.360 --> 3:53:20.520
 seems to be beautiful.

3:53:20.520 --> 3:53:26.600
 I think there's a certain intuition with physicists, with people that a simple theory

3:53:26.600 --> 3:53:30.800
 like this reducibility pockets of reducibility is the ultimate goal.

3:53:30.800 --> 3:53:37.800
 And I think what she tries to argue is no, we just need to come up with theories that

3:53:37.800 --> 3:53:40.720
 are just really good at predicting physical phenomena.

3:53:40.720 --> 3:53:48.480
 It's okay to have a bunch of disparate theories as opposed to trying to chase this beautiful

3:53:48.480 --> 3:53:52.160
 theory of everything is the ultimate beautiful theory, a simple one.

3:53:52.160 --> 3:53:54.720
 You know, it's always, it's always, what's your response to that?

3:53:54.720 --> 3:53:59.840
 Well, so what you're quoting is, I don't know the Sabine Hassenfelder's, you know,

3:53:59.840 --> 3:54:07.640
 exactly what she said, but let me, let me, let me, let me respond to what you were describing,

3:54:07.640 --> 3:54:14.480
 which may or may not have anything to do with what Sabine Hassenfelder says or thinks.

3:54:14.480 --> 3:54:16.480
 Sorry, Sabine.

3:54:16.480 --> 3:54:17.480
 Right.

3:54:17.480 --> 3:54:18.480
 I'm misquoting.

3:54:18.480 --> 3:54:25.480
 But I mean, the question is, you know, does, is beauty a guide to whether something is

3:54:25.480 --> 3:54:26.480
 correct?

3:54:26.480 --> 3:54:27.480
 That's right.

3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:28.480
 Which is kind of also the story of Occam's razor.

3:54:28.480 --> 3:54:29.480
 Right.

3:54:29.480 --> 3:54:32.800
 You know, if you've got a bunch of different explanations of things, you know, is the thing

3:54:32.800 --> 3:54:36.680
 that is the simplest explanation likely to be the correct explanation.

3:54:36.680 --> 3:54:40.320
 And there are situations where that's true and there are situations where it isn't true.

3:54:40.320 --> 3:54:43.800
 Sometimes in human systems, it is true because people have kind of, you know, in evolutionary

3:54:43.800 --> 3:54:47.520
 systems, sometimes it's true because it's sort of been kicked to the point where it's

3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:49.520
 minimized.

3:54:49.520 --> 3:54:53.280
 But you know, in physics, does Occam's razor work?

3:54:53.280 --> 3:54:59.560
 You know, is there a simple quotes, beautiful explanation for things or is it a big mess?

3:54:59.560 --> 3:55:04.000
 You know, we don't intrinsically know, you know, I think that the, I wouldn't, before

3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:09.800
 I worked on the project in recent times, I would have said, we do not know how complicated

3:55:09.800 --> 3:55:12.440
 the rule for the universe will be.

3:55:12.440 --> 3:55:17.240
 And I would have said, you know, the one thing we know, which is a fundamental fact about

3:55:17.240 --> 3:55:21.840
 science, that's the thing that makes science possible, is that there is order in the universe.

3:55:21.840 --> 3:55:25.880
 I mean, you know, early theologians would have used that as an argument for the existence

3:55:25.880 --> 3:55:29.520
 of God, because it's like, why is there order in the universe?

3:55:29.520 --> 3:55:33.800
 Why doesn't every single particle in the universe just do its own thing?

3:55:33.800 --> 3:55:37.320
 You know, something must be making there be order in the universe.

3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:42.960
 We, you know, in the sort of early theology point of view, that's, you know, the role

3:55:42.960 --> 3:55:45.280
 of God is to do that, so to speak.

3:55:45.280 --> 3:55:50.240
 In our, you know, we might say it's the role of a formal theory to do that.

3:55:50.240 --> 3:55:53.360
 And then the question is, but how simple should that theory be?

3:55:53.360 --> 3:56:00.720
 And should that theory be one that, you know, where I think the point is, if it's simple,

3:56:00.720 --> 3:56:05.960
 it's almost inevitably somewhat beautiful in the sense that, because all the stuff that

3:56:05.960 --> 3:56:08.920
 we see has to fit into this little tiny theory.

3:56:08.920 --> 3:56:13.400
 And the way it does that has to be, you know, it depends on your notion of beauty.

3:56:13.400 --> 3:56:22.120
 But I mean, for me, the sort of the surprising connectivity of it is at least in my aesthetic,

3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:25.200
 that's something that, you know, responds to my aesthetic.

3:56:25.200 --> 3:56:32.960
 But the question is, I mean, you're a fascinating person in the sense that you're once talking

3:56:32.960 --> 3:56:38.840
 about computational, the fundamental computational reducibility of the universe.

3:56:38.840 --> 3:56:44.200
 And on the other hand, trying to come up with a theory of everything, which simply describes

3:56:44.200 --> 3:56:50.680
 the simple origins of that computational reducibility.

3:56:50.680 --> 3:56:51.680
 Right.

3:56:51.680 --> 3:56:55.760
 I mean, both of those things are kind of, it's paralyzing to think that we can't make

3:56:55.760 --> 3:56:58.800
 any sense of the universe in the general case.

3:56:58.800 --> 3:57:05.080
 But it's hopeful to think like, one, we can think of a rule that generates this whole

3:57:05.080 --> 3:57:13.160
 complexity and two, we can find pockets of reducibility that are powerful for everyday

3:57:13.160 --> 3:57:15.760
 life to do different kinds of predictions.

3:57:15.760 --> 3:57:23.160
 I suppose Sabine wants to find, focus on the finding of small pockets of reducibility

3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:27.080
 versus the theory of everything.

3:57:27.080 --> 3:57:30.920
 You know, it's a funny thing because, you know, a bunch of people have started working

3:57:30.920 --> 3:57:37.240
 on this physics project, people who are physicists, basically.

3:57:37.240 --> 3:57:42.960
 And it is really a fascinating sociological phenomenon because what, you know, when I

3:57:42.960 --> 3:57:48.880
 was working on this before in the 1990s, you know, wrote it up, put it, it's 100 pages

3:57:48.880 --> 3:57:52.560
 over this 1200 page book that I wrote, New Kind of Sciences, you know, 100 pages of that

3:57:52.560 --> 3:57:54.480
 is about physics.

3:57:54.480 --> 3:58:01.400
 And I saw it at that time, not as a pinnacle achievement, but rather as a use case, so

3:58:01.400 --> 3:58:02.400
 to speak.

3:58:02.400 --> 3:58:05.640
 I mean, my main point was this new kind of science and it's like, you can apply it to

3:58:05.640 --> 3:58:09.640
 biology, you can apply it to, you know, other kinds of physics, you can apply it to fundamental

3:58:09.640 --> 3:58:10.640
 physics.

3:58:10.640 --> 3:58:12.760
 It's just an application, so to speak.

3:58:12.760 --> 3:58:15.120
 It's not the core thing.

3:58:15.120 --> 3:58:21.520
 But then, you know, one of the things that was interesting with that book was, you know,

3:58:21.520 --> 3:58:25.800
 what comes out, lots of people think it's pretty interesting and lots of people start

3:58:25.800 --> 3:58:28.360
 using what it has in different kinds of fields.

3:58:28.360 --> 3:58:34.840
 The one field where there was sort of a heavy pitchforking was from my friends, the fundamental

3:58:34.840 --> 3:58:39.040
 physics people, which was, it's like, no, this can't possibly be right.

3:58:39.040 --> 3:58:43.080
 And you know, it's like, you know, if what you're doing is right, it'll overturn 50 years

3:58:43.080 --> 3:58:44.080
 of what we've been doing.

3:58:44.080 --> 3:58:47.280
 And it's like, no, it won't, was what I was saying.

3:58:47.280 --> 3:58:53.240
 It's like, but, you know, for a while, when I started, you know, I was going to go on

3:58:53.240 --> 3:58:58.800
 back in 2002, well, 2004, actually, I was going to go on working on this project.

3:58:58.800 --> 3:59:04.280
 And I actually stopped partly because it's like, why am I, you know, this is like, I've

3:59:04.280 --> 3:59:05.800
 been in business a long time, right?

3:59:05.800 --> 3:59:10.000
 I'm building a product for a target market that doesn't want the product.

3:59:10.000 --> 3:59:11.000
 And it's like...

3:59:11.000 --> 3:59:12.000
 Yeah, why work?

3:59:12.000 --> 3:59:13.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:59:13.000 --> 3:59:14.000
 Why work against it?

3:59:14.000 --> 3:59:15.000
 Swim against the current?

3:59:15.000 --> 3:59:16.000
 Right.

3:59:16.000 --> 3:59:19.800
 What happened, which is sort of interesting, is that a couple of things happened.

3:59:19.800 --> 3:59:26.840
 And it was, it was like, you know, it was like, I don't want to do this project because

3:59:26.840 --> 3:59:32.880
 I can do so many other things, which I'm really interested in, where, you know, people say,

3:59:32.880 --> 3:59:36.680
 great, thanks for those tools, thanks for those ideas, et cetera.

3:59:36.680 --> 3:59:41.960
 Whereas, you know, if you're dealing with kind of a, you know, a sort of a structure

3:59:41.960 --> 3:59:44.400
 where people are saying, no, no, we don't want this new stuff.

3:59:44.400 --> 3:59:45.400
 We don't need any new stuff.

3:59:45.400 --> 3:59:46.880
 We're really fine with what we're doing.

3:59:46.880 --> 3:59:49.880
 Yeah, there's like, literally, like, I don't know, millions of people who are thankful

3:59:49.880 --> 3:59:55.080
 for Wolfram Alpha, a bunch of people wrote to me how thankful they are, they are a different

3:59:55.080 --> 3:59:57.920
 crowd than the theoretical physics community, perhaps.

3:59:57.920 --> 3:59:58.920
 Yeah, well, right.

3:59:58.920 --> 4:00:03.240
 But, you know, the theoretical physics community pretty much uniformly uses Wolfram language

4:00:03.240 --> 4:00:04.640
 and Mathematica, right?

4:00:04.640 --> 4:00:10.840
 And so it's kind of like, like, you know, and that's, but the thing is, what happens,

4:00:10.840 --> 4:00:12.720
 you know, this is what happens.

4:00:12.720 --> 4:00:16.880
 Whatever fields do not, you know, it's like, we're doing what we're doing, we have the

4:00:16.880 --> 4:00:20.480
 methods that we have, and where we're just fine here.

4:00:20.480 --> 4:00:25.880
 Now what's happened in the last 18 years or so, I think, is a couple of things have happened.

4:00:25.880 --> 4:00:31.920
 First of all, the hope that, you know, string theory or whatever would deliver the fundamental

4:00:31.920 --> 4:00:34.960
 theory of physics, that hope has disappeared.

4:00:34.960 --> 4:00:40.160
 That the, another thing that's happened is the sort of the interest in computation around

4:00:40.160 --> 4:00:45.880
 physics has been greatly enhanced by the whole quantum information, quantum computing story.

4:00:45.880 --> 4:00:50.720
 People, you know, the idea there might be something sort of computational related to

4:00:50.720 --> 4:00:53.320
 physics has somehow, somehow grown.

4:00:53.320 --> 4:00:55.880
 And I think, you know, it's, it's sort of interesting.

4:00:55.880 --> 4:01:00.640
 I mean, right now, if we say, you know, it's like, if you're like, who else is trying to

4:01:00.640 --> 4:01:02.760
 come up with the fundamental theory of physics?

4:01:02.760 --> 4:01:06.680
 It's like, there aren't professional, no professional, no professional, no professional

4:01:06.680 --> 4:01:07.680
 physicists.

4:01:07.680 --> 4:01:12.920
 I mean, you're, I mean, you've talked with him, but just as a matter of personalities

4:01:12.920 --> 4:01:17.600
 because it's a beautiful story, what are your thoughts about Eric Weinstein's work?

4:01:17.600 --> 4:01:23.720
 You know, I think his, his, I mean, he did a PhD thesis in mathematical physics at Harvard.

4:01:23.720 --> 4:01:25.120
 Yeah, he's a mathematical physicist.

4:01:25.120 --> 4:01:31.040
 And you know, it's, it seems like it's kind of, you know, it's, it's in that framework

4:01:31.040 --> 4:01:36.240
 and it's kind of like, I'm not sure how much further it's got than this PhD thesis, which

4:01:36.240 --> 4:01:37.880
 was 20 years ago or something.

4:01:37.880 --> 4:01:42.960
 And I think that, you know, the, the, you know, it's a fairly specific piece of mathematical

4:01:42.960 --> 4:01:45.360
 physics that's quite nice.

4:01:45.360 --> 4:01:47.720
 And what trajectory do you hope it takes?

4:01:47.720 --> 4:01:48.720
 I mean,

4:01:48.720 --> 4:01:52.600
 Well, I think in his particular case, I mean, from what I understand, which is not everything

4:01:52.600 --> 4:01:53.600
 at all.

4:01:53.600 --> 4:01:58.080
 But, you know, I think I know the rough tradition at least is operating in this sort of theory

4:01:58.080 --> 4:01:59.320
 of gauge theories,

4:01:59.320 --> 4:02:01.520
 Gauge theories, local gauge invariance and so on.

4:02:01.520 --> 4:02:02.520
 Okay.

4:02:02.520 --> 4:02:06.560
 So it's very close to understanding how local gauge invariance works in our models and it's

4:02:06.560 --> 4:02:12.320
 very beautiful and it's very, um, and, you know, does some of the mathematical structure

4:02:12.320 --> 4:02:16.040
 that he's enthusiastic about fit quite possibly, yes.

4:02:16.040 --> 4:02:19.240
 So there might be a possibility of trying to understand how those things fit, how gauge

4:02:19.240 --> 4:02:20.240
 theory fits.

4:02:20.240 --> 4:02:21.240
 Might very well.

4:02:21.240 --> 4:02:23.680
 I mean, the question is, you know, so there are a couple of things one might try to get

4:02:23.680 --> 4:02:24.680
 in the world.

4:02:24.680 --> 4:02:27.280
 So for example, it's like, can we get three dimensions of space?

4:02:27.280 --> 4:02:29.280
 We haven't managed to get that yet.

4:02:29.280 --> 4:02:34.600
 Gauge theory, the standard model of particle physics says that it's SU three cross SU two

4:02:34.600 --> 4:02:35.600
 cross U one.

4:02:35.600 --> 4:02:41.600
 Those are the designations of these, um, Lee groups, um, it doesn't, but, but anyway,

4:02:41.600 --> 4:02:46.880
 so those are, those are sort of representations of symmetries of the theory.

4:02:46.880 --> 4:02:52.480
 And, um, so, you know, it is conceivable that it is generically true.

4:02:52.480 --> 4:02:53.480
 Okay.

4:02:53.480 --> 4:02:58.560
 So all those are subgroups of a group called E eight, which is a weird exceptional Lee

4:02:58.560 --> 4:02:59.560
 group.

4:02:59.560 --> 4:03:00.560
 Okay.

4:03:00.560 --> 4:03:01.560
 It is conceivable.

4:03:01.560 --> 4:03:05.640
 I don't know whether it's the case that that will be generic in these models, that it will

4:03:05.640 --> 4:03:13.920
 be generic, that the gauge invariance of the model has this property just as things like

4:03:13.920 --> 4:03:21.480
 general relativity, which corresponds to think, uh, uh, general covariance, which is another

4:03:21.480 --> 4:03:27.080
 gauge like invariance, it could conceivably be the case that the kind of local gauge

4:03:27.080 --> 4:03:31.680
 invariance that we see in particle physics is somehow generic.

4:03:31.680 --> 4:03:34.880
 And, and that would be a, you know, the thing that's, that's really cool.

4:03:34.880 --> 4:03:39.840
 I think, you know, sociologically, although this hasn't really hit yet is that all of

4:03:39.840 --> 4:03:43.240
 these different things, all these different things people have been working on in these,

4:03:43.240 --> 4:03:47.240
 in some cases, quite obstruce areas of mathematical physics.

4:03:47.240 --> 4:03:51.200
 An awful lot of them seem to tie into what we're doing and, you know, it might not be

4:03:51.200 --> 4:03:52.200
 that way.

4:03:52.200 --> 4:03:53.200
 Yeah, absolutely.

4:03:53.200 --> 4:03:54.200
 That's a beautiful thing.

4:03:54.200 --> 4:03:59.560
 I mean, but the reason I said, the reason our quinestine is important is to the point

4:03:59.560 --> 4:04:06.120
 that you mentioned before, which is, is strange that the theory of everything is not at the

4:04:06.120 --> 4:04:14.720
 core of, uh, the passion, the dream, the focus, the funding of the physics community.

4:04:14.720 --> 4:04:17.000
 It's too hard.

4:04:17.000 --> 4:04:18.000
 It's too hard.

4:04:18.000 --> 4:04:19.000
 And people gave up.

4:04:19.000 --> 4:04:24.440
 I mean, basically what happened is ancient Greece, people thought we're nearly there.

4:04:24.440 --> 4:04:26.520
 You know, the world is made of platonic solids.

4:04:26.520 --> 4:04:29.240
 It's, you know, water is a tetrahedron or something.

4:04:29.240 --> 4:04:30.240
 We're almost there.

4:04:30.240 --> 4:04:31.240
 Okay.

4:04:31.240 --> 4:04:35.280
 Long period of time where people were like, no, we don't know how it works.

4:04:35.280 --> 4:04:38.520
 You know, time of Newton, uh, you know, we're almost there.

4:04:38.520 --> 4:04:40.020
 Everything is gravitation.

4:04:40.020 --> 4:04:42.920
 You know, time of Faraday and Maxwell.

4:04:42.920 --> 4:04:43.920
 We're almost there.

4:04:43.920 --> 4:04:44.920
 Everything is fields.

4:04:44.920 --> 4:04:45.920
 Everything is the ether.

4:04:45.920 --> 4:04:46.920
 You know, then.

4:04:46.920 --> 4:04:49.720
 And the whole time we're making big progress though.

4:04:49.720 --> 4:04:50.720
 Oh, yes.

4:04:50.720 --> 4:04:51.720
 Absolutely.

4:04:51.720 --> 4:04:56.920
 But the fundamental theory of physics is almost a footnote because it's like, it's the machine

4:04:56.920 --> 4:04:57.920
 code.

4:04:57.920 --> 4:05:00.080
 It's like we're operating in the high level languages.

4:05:00.080 --> 4:05:01.080
 Yeah.

4:05:01.080 --> 4:05:02.720
 Um, you know, that's what we really care about.

4:05:02.720 --> 4:05:04.560
 That's what's relevant for our everyday physics.

4:05:04.560 --> 4:05:09.280
 We talked about different centuries and the 21st century will be, uh, everything's computation.

4:05:09.280 --> 4:05:10.280
 Yes.

4:05:10.280 --> 4:05:14.120
 If that takes us all the way, we don't know, but it might take us pretty far.

4:05:14.120 --> 4:05:15.120
 Yes.

4:05:15.120 --> 4:05:16.120
 Right.

4:05:16.120 --> 4:05:19.480
 And the point is that it's like, you know, if you're doing biology, you might say, how

4:05:19.480 --> 4:05:23.160
 can you not be really interested in the origin of life and the definition of life?

4:05:23.160 --> 4:05:24.160
 Well, it's irrelevant.

4:05:24.160 --> 4:05:26.800
 You know, you're studying the properties of some virus.

4:05:26.800 --> 4:05:31.400
 It doesn't matter, you know, where, you know, you're operating at some much higher level.

4:05:31.400 --> 4:05:32.400
 And it's the same.

4:05:32.400 --> 4:05:36.120
 What's, what's happened with physics is I was sort of surprised at you.

4:05:36.120 --> 4:05:40.560
 I was sort of mapping out this history of, of people's efforts to understand the fundamental

4:05:40.560 --> 4:05:42.060
 theory of physics.

4:05:42.060 --> 4:05:45.900
 And it's remarkable how little has been done on this question.

4:05:45.900 --> 4:05:49.160
 And it's, you know, because, uh, you know, there've been times when there's been bursts

4:05:49.160 --> 4:05:50.160
 of enthusiasm.

4:05:50.160 --> 4:05:51.840
 Oh, we're almost there.

4:05:51.840 --> 4:05:57.040
 And then it decays and, and people just say, Oh, it's too hard, but it's not relevant

4:05:57.040 --> 4:05:58.040
 anyway.

4:05:58.040 --> 4:06:04.160
 And I think that the, um, the thing that, um, you know, so, so the question of, of, you

4:06:04.160 --> 4:06:07.480
 know, one question is, why does anybody, why should anybody care?

4:06:07.480 --> 4:06:08.480
 Right?

4:06:08.480 --> 4:06:10.960
 Why should anybody care what the fundamental theory of physics is?

4:06:10.960 --> 4:06:15.120
 I think it's intellectually interesting, but what will be the sort of, what will be

4:06:15.120 --> 4:06:16.680
 the impact of this?

4:06:16.680 --> 4:06:19.040
 What, I mean, this is the key question.

4:06:19.040 --> 4:06:26.160
 What do you think will happen if we figure out the fundamental theory of physics outside

4:06:26.160 --> 4:06:28.480
 of the intellectual curiosity of us?

4:06:28.480 --> 4:06:29.480
 Okay.

4:06:29.480 --> 4:06:30.480
 So here's my best guess.

4:06:30.480 --> 4:06:31.480
 Okay.

4:06:31.480 --> 4:06:36.680
 So if you look at the history of science, I think a very interesting analogy is Copernicus.

4:06:36.680 --> 4:06:37.680
 Okay.

4:06:37.680 --> 4:06:39.960
 So what did Copernicus do?

4:06:39.960 --> 4:06:43.360
 There'd been this Ptolemaic system for working out the motion of planets.

4:06:43.360 --> 4:06:44.360
 It did pretty well.

4:06:44.360 --> 4:06:47.120
 It used epicycles, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

4:06:47.120 --> 4:06:51.320
 It had all this computational ways of working out where planets will be.

4:06:51.320 --> 4:06:54.960
 When we work out where planets are today, we're basically using epicycles.

4:06:54.960 --> 4:07:00.880
 But Copernicus had this different way of formulating things in which he said, you know, and the

4:07:00.880 --> 4:07:04.200
 earth is going around the sun and that had a consequence.

4:07:04.200 --> 4:07:10.360
 The consequence was you can use this mathematical theory to conclude something, which is absolutely

4:07:10.360 --> 4:07:14.260
 not what we can tell from common sense, right?

4:07:14.260 --> 4:07:18.520
 So it's like, trust the mathematics, trust the science, okay?

4:07:18.520 --> 4:07:24.320
 Now fast forward 400 years and, you know, and now we're in this pandemic and it's kind

4:07:24.320 --> 4:07:28.400
 of like everybody thinks the science will figure out everything.

4:07:28.400 --> 4:07:31.400
 It's like from the science, we can just figure out what to do.

4:07:31.400 --> 4:07:33.120
 We can figure out everything.

4:07:33.120 --> 4:07:37.920
 That was before Copernicus, nobody would have thought if the science says something that

4:07:37.920 --> 4:07:42.640
 doesn't agree with our everyday experience where we just have to, you know, compute the

4:07:42.640 --> 4:07:46.560
 science and then figure out what to do, who would say that's completely crazy?

4:07:46.560 --> 4:07:50.680
 And so your sense is once we figure out the framework of computation that can basically

4:07:50.680 --> 4:07:58.080
 do any understand the fabric of reality, we'll be able to derive totally counterintuitive

4:07:58.080 --> 4:07:59.080
 things.

4:07:59.080 --> 4:08:04.520
 No, the point I think is the following that right now, you know, I talk about computational

4:08:04.520 --> 4:08:05.520
 irreducibility.

4:08:05.520 --> 4:08:10.120
 People, you know, I was very proud that I managed to get the term computational irreducibility

4:08:10.120 --> 4:08:12.840
 into the congressional record last year.

4:08:12.840 --> 4:08:13.840
 Oh, that's right.

4:08:13.840 --> 4:08:15.840
 By the way, that's a whole nother topic we could talk about.

4:08:15.840 --> 4:08:16.840
 Fascinating.

4:08:16.840 --> 4:08:17.840
 Different topic.

4:08:17.840 --> 4:08:18.840
 Different topic.

4:08:18.840 --> 4:08:23.840
 But in any case, you know, but so computational irreducibility is one of these sort of concepts

4:08:23.840 --> 4:08:27.120
 that I think is important in understanding lots of things in the world.

4:08:27.120 --> 4:08:31.680
 But the question is, it's only important if you believe the world is fundamentally computational,

4:08:31.680 --> 4:08:32.680
 right?

4:08:32.680 --> 4:08:38.560
 And, but if you, if you know the fundamental theory of physics and it's fundamentally computational,

4:08:38.560 --> 4:08:43.320
 then you've rooted the whole thing, that is, you know, the world is computational.

4:08:43.320 --> 4:08:49.280
 And while you can discuss whether, you know, it's not the case that people would say, well,

4:08:49.280 --> 4:08:52.960
 you have this whole computational irreducibility, all these features of computation, we don't

4:08:52.960 --> 4:08:57.440
 care about those, because after all, the world isn't computational, you might say.

4:08:57.440 --> 4:09:03.480
 But if you know, you know, base, base, base thing, physics is computational, then you

4:09:03.480 --> 4:09:07.920
 know that that stuff is, you know, that that's kind of the grounding for that stuff.

4:09:07.920 --> 4:09:12.840
 Just as, in a sense, Copernicus was the grounding for the idea that you could figure out something

4:09:12.840 --> 4:09:20.260
 with math and science that was not what you would intuitively think from your senses.

4:09:20.260 --> 4:09:24.760
 So now we've got to this point where, for example, we say, you know, once we have the

4:09:24.760 --> 4:09:30.320
 idea that computation is the foundational thing that explains our whole universe, then

4:09:30.320 --> 4:09:33.560
 we have to say, well, what does it mean for other things?

4:09:33.560 --> 4:09:35.360
 Like, it means there's computational irreducibility.

4:09:35.360 --> 4:09:38.040
 That means science is limited in certain ways.

4:09:38.040 --> 4:09:39.920
 That means this, that means that.

4:09:39.920 --> 4:09:44.880
 But the fact that we have that grounding means that, you know, and I think, for example,

4:09:44.880 --> 4:09:50.480
 for Copernicus, for instance, the implications of his work on the sort of mathematics of

4:09:50.480 --> 4:09:54.640
 astronomy were cool, but they involved a very small number of people.

4:09:54.640 --> 4:09:58.600
 The implications of his work for sort of the philosophy of how you think about things were

4:09:58.600 --> 4:10:02.960
 vast and involved, you know, everybody, more or less.

4:10:02.960 --> 4:10:03.960
 But do you think so?

4:10:03.960 --> 4:10:08.640
 That's actually the way scientists and people see the world around us.

4:10:08.640 --> 4:10:10.400
 So it has a huge impact in that sense.

4:10:10.400 --> 4:10:18.240
 Do you think it might have an impact more directly to engineering derivations from physics,

4:10:18.240 --> 4:10:22.080
 like propulsion systems, our ability to colonize the world?

4:10:22.080 --> 4:10:24.760
 Like, for example, okay, this is like sci fi.

4:10:24.760 --> 4:10:34.120
 But if you understand the computational nature, say, of the different forces of physics, you

4:10:34.120 --> 4:10:38.640
 know, there's a notion of being able to, you know, warp gravity.

4:10:38.640 --> 4:10:39.640
 Things like this.

4:10:39.640 --> 4:10:40.640
 Yeah.

4:10:40.640 --> 4:10:41.640
 Can we make warp drive?

4:10:41.640 --> 4:10:42.640
 Warp drive, yeah.

4:10:42.640 --> 4:10:43.640
 Yeah, right.

4:10:43.640 --> 4:10:47.760
 So like, would we be able to, will it, you know, will like Elon Musk start paying attention?

4:10:47.760 --> 4:10:50.560
 Like, it's awfully costly to launch these rockets.

4:10:50.560 --> 4:10:53.120
 Do you think we'll be able to, yeah, create warp drive?

4:10:53.120 --> 4:10:54.120
 Right.

4:10:54.120 --> 4:10:55.120
 Yeah.

4:10:55.120 --> 4:10:56.120
 I set myself some homework.

4:10:56.120 --> 4:11:00.000
 I agreed to give a talk at some NASA workshop in a few weeks about faster than light travel.

4:11:00.000 --> 4:11:02.800
 So I haven't figured it out yet, but no, but.

4:11:02.800 --> 4:11:03.800
 You got two weeks.

4:11:03.800 --> 4:11:04.800
 Yeah, right.

4:11:04.800 --> 4:11:07.960
 But do you think that kind of understanding of fundamental theory of physics can lead

4:11:07.960 --> 4:11:09.520
 to those engineering breakthroughs?

4:11:09.520 --> 4:11:10.520
 Okay.

4:11:10.520 --> 4:11:12.000
 I think it's far away, but I'm not certain.

4:11:12.000 --> 4:11:16.680
 I mean, you know, this is the thing that, that I set myself an exercise when gravity

4:11:16.680 --> 4:11:19.280
 waves, gravitational waves were discovered, right?

4:11:19.280 --> 4:11:23.400
 I set myself the exercise of what would black hole technology look like?

4:11:23.400 --> 4:11:27.040
 In other words, right now, you know, black holes are far away that, you know, how on

4:11:27.040 --> 4:11:28.200
 earth can we do things with them?

4:11:28.200 --> 4:11:32.560
 But just imagine that we could get, you know, pet black holes right in our backyard.

4:11:32.560 --> 4:11:34.600
 You know, what kind of technology could be built with them?

4:11:34.600 --> 4:11:36.840
 I got a certain distance, not that far.

4:11:36.840 --> 4:11:41.120
 But I think in, in, you know, so there are ideas, you know, I have this, one of the

4:11:41.120 --> 4:11:45.800
 weirder ideas is things I'm calling space tunnels, which are higher dimensional pieces

4:11:45.800 --> 4:11:52.120
 of space time, where basically you can, you know, in our three dimensional space, there

4:11:52.120 --> 4:11:56.960
 might be a five dimensional, you know, region, which actually will appear as a white hole

4:11:56.960 --> 4:12:01.160
 on one end and a black hole at the other end, you know, who knows whether they exist.

4:12:01.160 --> 4:12:05.000
 And then the questions are another one, okay, this is another crazy one is the thing that

4:12:05.000 --> 4:12:07.000
 I'm calling a vacuum cleaner.

4:12:07.000 --> 4:12:08.000
 Okay.

4:12:08.000 --> 4:12:12.800
 So, so, so I mentioned that, you know, there's all this activity in the universe, which is

4:12:12.800 --> 4:12:15.120
 maintaining the structure of space.

4:12:15.120 --> 4:12:20.320
 And that leads to a certain energy density effectively in space.

4:12:20.320 --> 4:12:27.440
 And so the question, in fact, dark energy is a story of essentially negative mass produced

4:12:27.440 --> 4:12:33.400
 by the absence of energy you thought would be there, so to speak.

4:12:33.400 --> 4:12:37.880
 And we don't know exactly how it works in our, either our model or the physical universe.

4:12:37.880 --> 4:12:43.000
 But this notion of a vacuum cleaner is a thing where, you know, you have all these things

4:12:43.000 --> 4:12:44.600
 that are maintaining the structure of space.

4:12:44.600 --> 4:12:48.840
 But what if you could clean out some of that stuff that's maintaining the structure of space

4:12:48.840 --> 4:12:51.320
 and make a simpler vacuum somewhere?

4:12:51.320 --> 4:12:52.320
 Yeah.

4:12:52.320 --> 4:12:53.320
 You know, what would that do?

4:12:53.320 --> 4:12:54.320
 A totally different kind of vacuum.

4:12:54.320 --> 4:12:55.320
 Right.

4:12:55.320 --> 4:12:59.360
 And that would lead to negative energy density, which would need to, so gravity is usually

4:12:59.360 --> 4:13:07.240
 a purely attractive force, but negative mass would lead to repulsive gravity and lead to

4:13:07.240 --> 4:13:08.480
 all kinds of weird things.

4:13:08.480 --> 4:13:11.280
 Now, can it be done in our universe?

4:13:11.280 --> 4:13:18.120
 You know, my immediate thought is no, but, but, you know, the fact is that, okay, so

4:13:18.120 --> 4:13:21.680
 once you understand the fact, because you're saying like, at this level of abstraction,

4:13:21.680 --> 4:13:25.000
 can we reach to the lower levels and mess with it?

4:13:25.000 --> 4:13:26.000
 Yes.

4:13:26.000 --> 4:13:31.280
 Once you understand the levels, I think I know, and I'm, you know, I have to say that

4:13:31.280 --> 4:13:35.920
 this reminds me of people telling one years ago that, you know, you'll never transmit

4:13:35.920 --> 4:13:41.880
 data over a copper wire at more than a thousand, you know, a thousand board or something, right?

4:13:41.880 --> 4:13:44.040
 And this is why did that not happen?

4:13:44.040 --> 4:13:45.040
 You know, why did it?

4:13:45.040 --> 4:13:47.160
 Why do we have these much, much faster data transmission?

4:13:47.160 --> 4:13:50.880
 Because we've understood many more of the details of what's actually going on.

4:13:50.880 --> 4:13:52.640
 And it's the same exact story here.

4:13:52.640 --> 4:13:57.160
 And it's the same, you know, I think that this, as I say, I think one of the features

4:13:57.160 --> 4:14:03.040
 of sort of one of the things about our time that will seem incredibly naive in the future

4:14:03.040 --> 4:14:09.280
 is the belief that, you know, things like heat is just random motion of molecules.

4:14:09.280 --> 4:14:11.400
 That it's just, just throw up your hands.

4:14:11.400 --> 4:14:12.400
 It's just random.

4:14:12.400 --> 4:14:14.240
 We can't say anything about it.

4:14:14.240 --> 4:14:15.400
 That will seem naive.

4:14:15.400 --> 4:14:20.200
 Yeah, the, at the heat death of the universe, those particles would be laughing at us humans

4:14:20.200 --> 4:14:21.200
 thinking.

4:14:21.200 --> 4:14:22.200
 Yes.

4:14:22.200 --> 4:14:23.200
 Right.

4:14:23.200 --> 4:14:24.200
 That life is not beautiful.

4:14:24.200 --> 4:14:25.200
 That life is not beautiful.

4:14:25.200 --> 4:14:26.200
 You know.

4:14:26.200 --> 4:14:28.920
 Humans used to think they're special with their little brains.

4:14:28.920 --> 4:14:29.920
 Well, right.

4:14:29.920 --> 4:14:34.080
 But also, and they used to think that this would just be random and uninteresting.

4:14:34.080 --> 4:14:39.000
 But that's, but so, so this question about whether you can, you know, mess with the underlying

4:14:39.000 --> 4:14:44.000
 structure and how you find a way to mess with the underlying structure, that's a, you know,

4:14:44.000 --> 4:14:48.920
 I have to say, you know, my immediate thing is, boy, that seems really hard.

4:14:48.920 --> 4:14:54.120
 But then, and, and, you know, possibly computational irreducibility will bite you.

4:14:54.120 --> 4:14:57.480
 But then there's always some path of computational reducibility.

4:14:57.480 --> 4:15:01.120
 And that path of computational reducibility is the engineering invention.

4:15:01.120 --> 4:15:02.120
 Exactly.

4:15:02.120 --> 4:15:03.120
 That has to be made.

4:15:03.120 --> 4:15:05.880
 Those little pockets can have huge engineering impact.

4:15:05.880 --> 4:15:06.880
 Right.

4:15:06.880 --> 4:15:07.880
 And I think that that's right.

4:15:07.880 --> 4:15:11.520
 And I mean, we live in, you know, we make use of so many of those pockets.

4:15:11.520 --> 4:15:18.800
 And the fact is, you know, I, I, you know, this, this is, yes, it's a, you know, it's

4:15:18.800 --> 4:15:24.640
 one of these things where, where, you know, I'm a person who likes to figure out ideas

4:15:24.640 --> 4:15:25.640
 and so on.

4:15:25.640 --> 4:15:29.280
 And there's sort of tests of my level of imagination, so to speak.

4:15:29.280 --> 4:15:34.720
 And so a couple of places where there's sort of serious humility in terms of my level of

4:15:34.720 --> 4:15:35.720
 imagination.

4:15:35.720 --> 4:15:40.080
 One is this thing about different reference frames for understanding the universe where

4:15:40.080 --> 4:15:42.360
 like, imagine the physics of the aliens.

4:15:42.360 --> 4:15:43.760
 What will it be like?

4:15:43.760 --> 4:15:45.360
 And I'm like, that's really hard.

4:15:45.360 --> 4:15:49.400
 I don't know, you know, and, and, and, and I mean, I think once you have the framework

4:15:49.400 --> 4:15:55.200
 in place, you can at least reason about the things you don't know, yes, maybe can't know

4:15:55.200 --> 4:15:57.680
 or like, it's too hard for, for you to know.

4:15:57.680 --> 4:16:03.560
 But then the, the mathematics can, that's exactly it, allow you to reach beyond where

4:16:03.560 --> 4:16:05.040
 you can reason.

4:16:05.040 --> 4:16:09.720
 Right, well, so, so I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to not have, you know, if you think

4:16:09.720 --> 4:16:14.000
 back to Alan Turing, for example, and, you know, when he invented Turing machines, you

4:16:14.000 --> 4:16:17.800
 know, and, and imagining what computers would end up doing, so to speak.

4:16:17.800 --> 4:16:18.800
 Yeah.

4:16:18.800 --> 4:16:19.800
 You know, and it's very difficult.

4:16:19.800 --> 4:16:20.800
 It's difficult.

4:16:20.800 --> 4:16:21.800
 Right.

4:16:21.800 --> 4:16:22.800
 And it's, I mean, this thing.

4:16:22.800 --> 4:16:25.560
 Made a few reasonable predictions, but most of it he couldn't predict possibly.

4:16:25.560 --> 4:16:29.160
 By the time, by 1950, he was making reasonable predictions about some things.

4:16:29.160 --> 4:16:30.160
 But not the 30s.

4:16:30.160 --> 4:16:31.160
 Yeah.

4:16:31.160 --> 4:16:32.160
 Right.

4:16:32.160 --> 4:16:37.360
 But when he first, you know, conceptualized, you know, and he conceptualized universal computing

4:16:37.360 --> 4:16:41.560
 for a very specific mathematical reason that wasn't, wasn't as general.

4:16:41.560 --> 4:16:45.880
 But yes, it's a, it's a good sort of exercise in humility to realize that, that it's kind

4:16:45.880 --> 4:16:49.600
 of like, it's, it's really hard to figure these things out.

4:16:49.600 --> 4:16:55.520
 The engineering of, of the universe, if we know how the universe works, how can we engineer

4:16:55.520 --> 4:16:56.520
 it?

4:16:56.520 --> 4:16:57.520
 That's such a beautiful vision.

4:16:57.520 --> 4:16:58.520
 That's such a beautiful vision.

4:16:58.520 --> 4:17:02.240
 That's the way I have to mention one more thing, which is the ultimate question of, of

4:17:02.240 --> 4:17:07.440
 from physics is, okay, so we have this abstract model of the universe.

4:17:07.440 --> 4:17:10.000
 Why does the universe exist at all?

4:17:10.000 --> 4:17:11.000
 Right.

4:17:11.000 --> 4:17:17.120
 So, you know, we might say there is a formal model that if you run this model, you get

4:17:17.120 --> 4:17:18.120
 the universe.

4:17:18.120 --> 4:17:19.120
 Yeah.

4:17:19.120 --> 4:17:22.120
 Or the model gives you, you know, a model of the universe, right?

4:17:22.120 --> 4:17:27.840
 You, you, you run this mathematical thing and the mathematics unfolds in the way that

4:17:27.840 --> 4:17:29.440
 corresponds to the universe.

4:17:29.440 --> 4:17:32.480
 But the question is, why was that actualized?

4:17:32.480 --> 4:17:36.120
 Why does the actual universe actually exist?

4:17:36.120 --> 4:17:41.120
 And so this is, this is another one of these humility and, and it's like, can you figure

4:17:41.120 --> 4:17:42.120
 this out?

4:17:42.120 --> 4:17:43.120
 I have a guess.

4:17:43.120 --> 4:17:44.120
 Okay.

4:17:44.120 --> 4:17:45.120
 About the answer to that.

4:17:45.120 --> 4:17:50.200
 And my guess is somewhat unsatisfying, but my guess is that it's a little bit similar

4:17:50.200 --> 4:17:55.360
 to Girdle's second incompleteness theorem, which is the statement that from within as

4:17:55.360 --> 4:18:00.080
 an axiomatic theory like Piano Arithmetic, you cannot from within that theory prove the

4:18:00.080 --> 4:18:02.440
 consistency of the theory.

4:18:02.440 --> 4:18:10.040
 So my guess is that for entities within the universe, there is no finite determination

4:18:10.040 --> 4:18:17.040
 that can be made of the, the, the statement the universe exists is essentially undecidable

4:18:17.040 --> 4:18:19.960
 to any entity that is embedded in the universe.

4:18:19.960 --> 4:18:20.960
 Within that universe.

4:18:20.960 --> 4:18:23.120
 How does that make you feel that?

4:18:23.120 --> 4:18:28.080
 Is that, does that put you at peace that it's impossible?

4:18:28.080 --> 4:18:30.400
 Or is it really ultimately frustrating?

4:18:30.400 --> 4:18:37.440
 Well, I think it just says that it's not a kind of question that, you know, it's, there

4:18:37.440 --> 4:18:40.080
 are things that it is reasonable.

4:18:40.080 --> 4:18:44.600
 I mean, there's kinds of, you know, you can talk about hypercomputation as well.

4:18:44.600 --> 4:18:47.320
 You can say, imagine there was a hypercomputer, here's what it would do.

4:18:47.320 --> 4:18:48.320
 So, okay, great.

4:18:48.320 --> 4:18:51.200
 It would be lovely to have a hypercomputer, but unfortunately we can't make it in the

4:18:51.200 --> 4:18:52.200
 universe.

4:18:52.200 --> 4:18:56.520
 Like, it would be lovely to answer this, but unfortunately we can't do it in the universe.

4:18:56.520 --> 4:18:59.440
 And you know, this is all we have, so to speak.

4:18:59.440 --> 4:19:04.320
 And I think it's really just a statement, it's sort of, in the end, it'll be a kind

4:19:04.320 --> 4:19:08.360
 of a logical, logically inevitable statement, I think.

4:19:08.360 --> 4:19:13.480
 I think it will be something where it is, as you understand what it means to have, what

4:19:13.480 --> 4:19:17.800
 it means to have a sort of predicate of existence, and what it means to have these kinds of things,

4:19:17.800 --> 4:19:21.600
 it will sort of be inevitable that this has to be the case that from within that universe

4:19:21.600 --> 4:19:25.040
 you can't establish the reason for its existence, so to speak.

4:19:25.040 --> 4:19:27.000
 You can't prove that it exists, and so on.

4:19:27.000 --> 4:19:32.760
 And nevertheless, because of computation or reusability, the future is ultimately not

4:19:32.760 --> 4:19:36.560
 predictable, full of mystery, and that's what makes life worth living.

4:19:36.560 --> 4:19:37.560
 Right.

4:19:37.560 --> 4:19:38.560
 I mean, right.

4:19:38.560 --> 4:19:42.400
 And you know, it's funny for me, because as a pure sort of human being doing what I

4:19:42.400 --> 4:19:46.720
 do, it's, you know, I'm, you know, I like, I'm interested in people.

4:19:46.720 --> 4:19:52.280
 I like sort of the, you know, the whole human experience, so to speak, and yet it's a little

4:19:52.280 --> 4:19:57.360
 bit weird when I'm thinking, you know, it's all hypergraphs down there, and it's all just

4:19:57.360 --> 4:19:58.360
...

4:19:58.360 --> 4:19:59.360
 Hypergraphs all the way down.

4:19:59.360 --> 4:20:00.360
 Right.

4:20:00.360 --> 4:20:02.360
 It's like turtles all the way down.

4:20:02.360 --> 4:20:03.360
 Yeah.

4:20:03.360 --> 4:20:04.360
 Right.

4:20:04.360 --> 4:20:07.320
 And it's kind of, you know, it's, to me, it is a funny thing, because every so often

4:20:07.320 --> 4:20:10.920
 I get this, you know, as I'm thinking about, I think we've really gotten, you know, we've

4:20:10.920 --> 4:20:14.840
 really figured out kind of the essence of how physics works, and I'm like thinking to myself,

4:20:14.840 --> 4:20:18.680
 you know, here's this physical thing, and I'm like, you know, this feels like a very

4:20:18.680 --> 4:20:20.000
 definite thing.

4:20:20.000 --> 4:20:24.920
 How can it be the case that this is just some rural reference frame of, you know, this infinite

4:20:24.920 --> 4:20:28.560
 creature that is so abstract and so on?

4:20:28.560 --> 4:20:35.320
 And I kind of, it is a, it's a funny sort of feeling that, you know, we are, we're sort

4:20:35.320 --> 4:20:42.480
 of, it's like, in the end, it's just sort of, be happy we're just humans type of thing.

4:20:42.480 --> 4:20:49.200
 And it's kind of like, but, but we're making, we make things as, it's not like we're just

4:20:49.200 --> 4:20:50.200
 a tiny speck.

4:20:50.200 --> 4:20:58.680
 We are, in a sense, the, we are more important by virtue of the fact that, in a sense, it's

4:20:58.680 --> 4:21:06.880
 not like there's, there is no ultimate, you know, it's like, we're important because,

4:21:06.880 --> 4:21:10.800
 because, you know, we're here, so to speak, and we're not, it's not like there's a thing

4:21:10.800 --> 4:21:17.160
 where we're saying, you know, we are just but one sort of intelligence out of all these

4:21:17.160 --> 4:21:18.720
 other intelligences.

4:21:18.720 --> 4:21:23.280
 And so, you know, ultimately, there'll be the super intelligence, which is all of these

4:21:23.280 --> 4:21:25.320
 put together and it'll be very different from us.

4:21:25.320 --> 4:21:27.720
 No, it's actually going to be equivalent to us.

4:21:27.720 --> 4:21:34.840
 And the thing that makes us a sort of special is just the details of us, so to speak.

4:21:34.840 --> 4:21:39.760
 It's not something where we can say, oh, there's this other thing, you know, just you think

4:21:39.760 --> 4:21:44.520
 humans are cool, just wait until you've seen this, you know, it's going to be much more

4:21:44.520 --> 4:21:45.520
 impressive.

4:21:45.520 --> 4:21:49.200
 Well, no, it's all going to be kind of computationally equivalent.

4:21:49.200 --> 4:21:53.200
 And the thing that, you know, it's not going to be, oh, this thing is amazingly much more

4:21:53.200 --> 4:21:59.000
 impressive and amazingly much more meaningful, let's say, no, we're it.

4:21:59.000 --> 4:22:04.520
 I mean, that's, that's, that's the, and the symbolism of this particular moment.

4:22:04.520 --> 4:22:11.040
 So this has been one of the, one of the favorite conversations I've ever had, Stephen.

4:22:11.040 --> 4:22:16.640
 It's a huge honor to talk to you, to talk about a topic like this for four plus hours

4:22:16.640 --> 4:22:18.760
 on the fundamental theory of physics.

4:22:18.760 --> 4:22:24.800
 And yet we're just two finite descendants of apes that have to end this conversation

4:22:24.800 --> 4:22:27.760
 because darkness have come upon us.

4:22:27.760 --> 4:22:28.760
 Right.

4:22:28.760 --> 4:22:30.760
 And we're going to get bitten by mosquitoes and all kinds of terrible things.

4:22:30.760 --> 4:22:36.760
 The symbolism of that, we're talking about the most basic fabric of reality and having

4:22:36.760 --> 4:22:41.040
 to end because of the fact that things end.

4:22:41.040 --> 4:22:42.720
 It's tragic and beautiful, Stephen.

4:22:42.720 --> 4:22:43.720
 Thank you so much.

4:22:43.720 --> 4:22:44.720
 Huge honor.

4:22:44.720 --> 4:22:48.680
 I can't wait to see what you do in the next couple of days and next week, a month.

4:22:48.680 --> 4:22:50.840
 We're all watching with excitement.

4:22:50.840 --> 4:22:51.840
 Thank you so much.

4:22:51.840 --> 4:22:52.840
 Thanks.

4:22:52.840 --> 4:22:56.960

4:23:21.640 --> 4:23:24.720
 Physics isn't the most important thing.

4:23:24.720 --> 4:23:26.760
 Love is.

4:23:26.760 --> 4:23:27.760
