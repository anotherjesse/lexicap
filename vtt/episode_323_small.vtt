WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.740
 Once this whole thing falls apart

00:01.740 --> 00:04.040
 and we are climbing the kudzu vines

00:04.040 --> 00:05.480
 that spiral up the Sears Tower,

00:05.480 --> 00:07.000
 like they say in Fight Club,

00:07.000 --> 00:09.200
 Bobby will go back to his gatherer form

00:09.200 --> 00:11.340
 and be happy as a pig and shit.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.240
 Just walking around in a loincloth with his bird

00:13.240 --> 00:15.240
 hanging out, tracking jokes to people

00:15.240 --> 00:17.880
 and climbing up on them for a stool lap dance

00:17.880 --> 00:18.720
 or whatever he does.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.960
 You think some level of crazy is required for comedy?

00:21.960 --> 00:22.800
 Yeah.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.160
 Like at some point.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.600
 Yes.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.800
 Have there been low points in your life?

00:27.800 --> 00:29.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29.800 --> 00:30.640
 Yeah.

00:30.640 --> 00:31.480
 Yeah?

00:31.480 --> 00:32.320
 Yeah.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.160
 Yeah.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.800
 The following is a conversation with Will Sasso,

00:38.800 --> 00:41.480
 a comedian, actor, podcaster

00:41.480 --> 00:44.160
 and someone I've been a fan of for many years

00:44.160 --> 00:46.960
 since mad TV in the late 90s

00:46.960 --> 00:50.360
 to recently with the 10 minute podcast

00:50.360 --> 00:54.600
 and now the new podcast called Dudezy.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.440
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.320
 The supported, please check out our sponsors

00:58.320 --> 00:59.520
 in the description.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.920
 And now dear friends, here's Will Sasso.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.760
 So let's call it the elephant in the room.

01:06.760 --> 01:10.720
 You wore a black suit in a recent episode of Dudezy.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.560
 Yes.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.320
 You wore a black suit again today.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.660
 Shakespeare then Mark Twain said clothes make the man.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.320
 What kind of man does a suit make you?

01:22.320 --> 01:25.360
 Well, me in particular, it makes me a fellow

01:25.360 --> 01:28.320
 who did not get this dry cleaned in between

01:28.320 --> 01:30.920
 because that episode of the show as we sit here now

01:30.920 --> 01:32.560
 was around a week ago.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.160
 So that's the kind of man it makes me.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.280
 Well, the nice thing is you're wearing pants, I think.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.440
 Yeah, I am wearing pants.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.400
 I don't think you were wearing pants in the episode.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.240
 That's correct.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.120
 I prefer to wear shorts, but this was a special occasion.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.000
 So I'm wearing pants and I thought it fitting

01:48.000 --> 01:51.120
 obviously to just wear the black tie

01:51.120 --> 01:53.040
 and clothes do make the man.

01:53.040 --> 01:57.000
 And I would not consider myself to be a man of leisure

01:57.000 --> 02:00.960
 but I do enjoy shorts because my legs get hot.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.840
 So that's what kind of man the shorts make me.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.000
 Often you wear a suit.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.480
 I fucking hate wearing suits.

02:05.480 --> 02:09.160
 So what is this a statement of, is it ironic?

02:09.160 --> 02:12.120
 Or are you honoring the gods of this particular podcast?

02:12.120 --> 02:14.120
 I'm honoring the gods of this particular podcast

02:14.120 --> 02:15.360
 would be a good way to put it.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.880
 Yes, no, this is in reverence of and in dedication to you

02:19.880 --> 02:21.920
 and our newfound friendship here,

02:21.920 --> 02:26.000
 which we are making on the podcast.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.400
 You and I just met.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.560
 Everything that we're saying here

02:28.560 --> 02:31.120
 is the first things that we're saying to each other.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.800
 So I'm meeting you on common ground, dressed like.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.160
 Well, I've been actually a one way friend of yours

02:36.160 --> 02:38.160
 for many, many years, it's mad TV.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.160
 Oh.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.320
 When did you start on mad TV?

02:40.320 --> 02:42.240
 So that was, I mean, in 90s?

02:42.240 --> 02:43.080
 97, yeah.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.000
 97.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.640
 So I was a huge fan of yours and the cast was incredible.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.000
 It was one of the funniest shows ever created.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.640
 Your whole journey watching through that was incredible

02:51.640 --> 02:55.040
 from mad TV to three suges to the podcast,

02:55.040 --> 02:59.120
 the 10 minute pod and then the new podcast is incredible.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.080
 Cheers.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.840
 My favorite role that you played was the mountain

03:03.840 --> 03:05.840
 in the game of thrones.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.040
 What was it like working with dragons?

03:08.040 --> 03:10.960
 Well, the dragons are usually tennis balls

03:10.960 --> 03:16.080
 on the end of sea stands, but sometimes they hang out.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.760
 I am sea stand.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.520
 It's like, you know, it's like a little like the thing

03:20.520 --> 03:21.640
 you got the camera on here.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.920
 Oh, this is like film lingo.

03:22.920 --> 03:23.920
 Yeah, no, I understand.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.680
 I'm trying to impress you with my film lingo.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.320
 You know what a banana is?

03:27.320 --> 03:28.160
 Yeah.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.360
 When you walk like this, do it a banana.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.200
 I take it back.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.360
 I did not know what a banana was.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.160
 Yeah, see, it means something.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.880
 Yeah, cause it's just a food.

03:35.880 --> 03:36.720
 Yeah.

03:36.720 --> 03:37.560
 Normally.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.080
 You fancy Hollywood folk with the lingo.

03:40.080 --> 03:44.120
 And I'm, my name is Bjorn Hapthor Bjornsson

03:44.120 --> 03:46.320
 and I am seven foot four.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.320
 And yeah, so dragon stone.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.240
 Dragon stone scare me,

03:49.240 --> 03:51.600
 even though they've been extinct for a while.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.160
 We use scientists, right, does that check out?

03:54.160 --> 03:56.600
 Yeah, I actually, I'm really into video games.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.640
 I don't know if you play video games.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.720
 There's a, there's a Skyrim video game

04:01.720 --> 04:03.320
 that's part of the Elder Scrolls series.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.400
 And for the longest time,

04:04.400 --> 04:06.400
 there's a legend that there's dragons.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.800
 I think it started in Daggerfall.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.480
 And so I always, I grew up playing those video games,

04:10.480 --> 04:14.160
 a dreaming of one day meeting a dragon in a virtual world.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.840
 And eventually you did in Skyrim.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.720
 So it's dragons represent,

04:19.720 --> 04:21.120
 I don't know exactly what they represent,

04:21.120 --> 04:24.600
 but they represent maybe this kind of mythical creature

04:24.600 --> 04:26.160
 that is bigger,

04:26.160 --> 04:30.920
 that anything humans can possibly comprehend, maybe.

04:30.920 --> 04:34.000
 Cause they're so, they show up so often in myth

04:34.000 --> 04:37.400
 from the, from the religious stories,

04:37.400 --> 04:39.320
 you know, of the snake and so on, the serpent.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.960
 And I don't know what that is.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.720
 Well, this breathing fire, that's kind of weird.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.560
 It's interesting.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.400
 When I think about dragons,

04:44.400 --> 04:45.520
 cause now that you bring it up,

04:45.520 --> 04:47.480
 these are people that probably wouldn't have access

04:47.480 --> 04:49.360
 to the fact that there used to be dinosaurs.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.200
 Right.

04:50.200 --> 04:54.840
 But if they didn't, they're drawn things that look like,

04:54.840 --> 04:57.240
 you know, a dinosaur cousin, but cool,

04:57.240 --> 05:01.080
 that can breathe fire and has wacky wings and a spiked tail.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.320
 Yeah, where the heck did they come up with that?

05:04.320 --> 05:07.240
 Cause they're clearly of course represented in mythology,

05:07.240 --> 05:10.680
 all the way back to, no, not cave drawings.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.600
 Well, the Egyptians probably knew what the,

05:12.600 --> 05:13.640
 and they could time travel.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.720
 So they would have gone back to the caves.

05:15.720 --> 05:20.160
 Well, the aliens that placed living organisms on earth,

05:20.160 --> 05:23.840
 could time travel and they could plant legends

05:23.840 --> 05:25.960
 into the, into the collective intelligence

05:25.960 --> 05:27.560
 of the human species.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.440
 Yeah. And perhaps they were thinking of us

05:29.440 --> 05:30.640
 to do something smart with it.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.240
 And we didn't, we just came up with the sky.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.080
 Oh no.

05:33.080 --> 05:33.920
 We're just, what's that?

05:33.920 --> 05:35.080
 Sorry, that was very offensive.

05:35.080 --> 05:35.920
 I'm sorry.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.000
 I don't mean to offend you with your video game.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.680
 I'm more of a burger, a burger time Donkey Kong dude.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.080
 Oh, what is that?

05:44.080 --> 05:47.040
 That's an original burger time was an arcade game

05:47.040 --> 05:52.040
 that later showed up on the Intellivision was Intellivision.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.080
 I believe it was made by Texas Instruments,

05:55.080 --> 05:58.480
 horrible first generation video game console

05:58.480 --> 06:00.640
 and burger time, you just, it's like Super Mario,

06:00.640 --> 06:03.040
 you just got to stay away from the eggs

06:03.040 --> 06:04.400
 and the pickles and stuff.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.920
 And you just go, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep,

06:05.920 --> 06:08.080
 and you, the bun falls and then you go down to the,

06:08.080 --> 06:11.200
 meep, meep, meep, meep, in the cheese and then the meat.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.160
 I'm not going to say it's as complicated as Skyrim,

06:13.160 --> 06:17.600
 but it took me a while to finish it when I was seven.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.560
 Did you play video games that was a part of your life,

06:20.560 --> 06:23.000
 a part of the source of happiness for you at all?

06:23.000 --> 06:26.320
 It was, it was, I played video games up until around,

06:27.240 --> 06:30.120
 I think in 2010, I got the red ring of death

06:30.120 --> 06:31.800
 on my Xbox 360.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.640
 That was it?

06:32.640 --> 06:35.240
 That was it, I never, or whatever the Xbox was then.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.080
 Yeah.

06:36.080 --> 06:40.360
 I had, I was playing, I had finished the Grand Theft Auto

06:40.360 --> 06:42.880
 that was out and it finished the Red Dead Redemption.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.400
 So I was doing that thing where you just drive around,

06:46.400 --> 06:48.080
 you know, the streets of New York,

06:48.080 --> 06:50.760
 or just ride around on your horse shooting people

06:50.760 --> 06:53.680
 and, you know, throwing grenades into groups of people

06:53.680 --> 06:55.080
 in Grand Theft.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.600
 And you're describing the same thing that happened

06:57.600 --> 06:58.440
 a decade later,

06:58.440 --> 07:01.200
 because it's now Red Dead Redemption 2

07:01.200 --> 07:03.960
 and there's still not a new Grand Theft Auto, so.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.160
 Yeah, there isn't, right?

07:05.160 --> 07:06.000
 Yeah, they're working on it.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.120
 They're always flirting with that idea.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.120
 You know who else plays Skyrim?

07:10.120 --> 07:12.480
 Another person, the two people I'm a huge fan of

07:12.480 --> 07:14.760
 from that time in Matt TV is Bobby Lee.

07:14.760 --> 07:15.720
 He plays Skyrim?

07:15.720 --> 07:16.760
 He's a huge fan of Skyrim.

07:16.760 --> 07:17.920
 He plays every.

07:17.920 --> 07:22.440
 So what Bobby Lee loves to do is to grind,

07:22.440 --> 07:25.640
 do the boring task over and over, gather mushrooms.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.600
 They can Skyrim, you can fight dragons,

07:27.600 --> 07:29.520
 you can fight all kinds of things,

07:29.520 --> 07:31.920
 but you can also gather mushrooms and different ingredients

07:31.920 --> 07:34.000
 to make potions and all that kind of stuff.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.120
 He loves the ingredients.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.720
 That he's the, you know, in the hunter gatherer world,

07:37.720 --> 07:38.560
 he's the gatherer.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.720
 He's the gatherer.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.080
 Yeah, I've heard him described that way

07:42.080 --> 07:44.520
 and he likes to describe himself that way.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.600
 I worked with Bobby not too long ago.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.240
 He came and did a couple of days on this thing

07:48.240 --> 07:50.760
 we were shooting and I was looking forward

07:50.760 --> 07:52.280
 to catching up with my old pal.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.240
 And if you know anything about Bobby Lee,

07:54.240 --> 07:55.560
 you'd probably be able to predict

07:55.560 --> 07:57.360
 that he spent that entire time

07:57.360 --> 07:59.520
 playing farming on his iPad.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.080
 Well, humans are a source of anxiety and trouble.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.400
 So sometimes it's good to escape human interaction

08:05.400 --> 08:06.240
 through video games.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.080
 Totally.

08:07.080 --> 08:07.920
 I'm with him on that.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.120
 He's one of the funniest people ever.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.560
 What do you think makes him funny?

08:14.560 --> 08:16.720
 It's just all the times you've worked with him,

08:16.720 --> 08:21.720
 the nonstandard, nonsecular way of his being.

08:22.240 --> 08:26.880
 Bobby Lee is one of the most raw people,

08:26.880 --> 08:29.800
 raw performers who lets it all hang out

08:29.800 --> 08:31.680
 to the degree that he will even get naked

08:31.680 --> 08:32.720
 in front of his audience,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.600
 which is usually a metaphor for someone doing standup.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.560
 I'm bearing all, I'm showing you everything

08:38.560 --> 08:40.920
 and Bobby will just pull his bird out of his pants.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.200
 Yeah, I don't think he understands metaphor too much.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.480
 He embodies metaphor.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.080
 Yes, he embodies metaphor.

08:46.080 --> 08:49.240
 He's the gatherer, we call him the gathering metaphor.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.720
 Bobby the gatherer metaphor.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.520
 He's a metaphor for something else,

08:52.520 --> 08:53.920
 for somebody else's life.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.840
 Someday he'll be in the dictionary.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.680
 Yeah.

08:57.680 --> 08:58.800
 Representing some kind of concept,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.120
 maybe the metaphor itself.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.480
 Yeah, once this whole thing falls apart

09:02.480 --> 09:04.800
 and we are climbing the kudzu vines

09:04.800 --> 09:06.240
 that spiral up the Sears Tower,

09:06.240 --> 09:07.760
 like they say in Fight Club,

09:07.760 --> 09:09.920
 Bobby will go back to his gatherer form

09:09.920 --> 09:12.080
 and be happy as a pig and shit.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.480
 Just walking around in a loincloth

09:13.480 --> 09:14.840
 with his bird hanging out,

09:14.840 --> 09:17.080
 tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them

09:17.080 --> 09:19.400
 for a stool lap dance or whatever he does.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.120
 I'd love to dig into something he did.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.520
 You guys did a lot of great podcasts together.

09:24.520 --> 09:28.440
 He asked you in a very uncomfortable process

09:28.440 --> 09:29.840
 of why you don't do standup.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.960
 So let me ask you, do you hate money?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.320
 Well, I'm originally from Canada.

09:36.320 --> 09:40.880
 Yeah, so I'm a frickin Pinko socialist.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.800
 Is that where you come from?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.560
 That's not a nice thing to say.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.960
 I thought the Soviet Union, that is a nice thing to say.

09:47.960 --> 09:48.800
 Like Comrade.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.480
 Someone a Pinko.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.320
 Right, Comrade, he's a good socialist.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.160
 Yeah.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.600
 With red, like some bold colors.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.440
 Yeah.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.360
 There was an interesting tension in your voice

10:00.360 --> 10:01.440
 and the way you talked about it.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.200
 There's just not a source of happiness for you.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.360
 You respect the art form,

10:05.360 --> 10:08.320
 but it was not something that you were connected to,

10:08.320 --> 10:09.640
 if you felt connected to.

10:09.640 --> 10:10.560
 That's a good way to put it.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.120
 Yeah, I respect the art form a lot.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.160
 And I grew up with all the albums and stuff.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.560
 I had an older brother and sister who,

10:18.560 --> 10:23.560
 so we had George Carlin, we had Richard Pryor,

10:23.720 --> 10:26.840
 we had Robert Klein, we had Gilda Live,

10:26.840 --> 10:28.840
 the Gilda Radner concert.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.200
 We had all sorts of stuff.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.920
 But I don't know, there's a lot of reasons.

10:33.920 --> 10:38.600
 I do feel like a career and show business is,

10:38.600 --> 10:41.720
 it never goes the way you plan, like most things.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.040
 And I was fortunate enough to get started

10:44.040 --> 10:45.880
 outside of my native Vancouver,

10:45.880 --> 10:47.240
 or in my native Vancouver.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.640
 I grew up in the Burbs outside

10:48.640 --> 10:50.640
 and there was a lot of industry there.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.520
 So I was fortunate enough to get started as an actor

10:53.520 --> 10:54.760
 when I was like 16.

10:54.760 --> 10:59.760
 So yeah, there were some times early on

10:59.760 --> 11:03.280
 where I came up with some standup stuff and did it,

11:03.280 --> 11:06.120
 but yeah, I quickly abandoned it.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.800
 And then you go through, you do mad TV and stuff.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.240
 And that's where my, this is gonna sound weird.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.960
 Do I sound as anxiety as I did

11:14.960 --> 11:16.240
 when I was on Bobby's podcast,

11:16.240 --> 11:18.280
 trying to avoid his questions?

11:18.280 --> 11:20.360
 Well, he was giving you this face this whole time

11:20.360 --> 11:23.920
 that was making the whole just atmosphere

11:23.920 --> 11:25.160
 feel full of anxiety.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.000
 So I'm trying not to give you the face.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.920
 The whole time I was saying, play cool, play cool.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.240
 Yeah, okay.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.280
 Play cool, Lex.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.360
 Play cool, you said it out loud a couple of times.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.200
 I did.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.040
 Just, you know, you cut that out.

11:35.040 --> 11:35.880
 Play cool.

11:35.880 --> 11:36.720
 Play cool, dude.

11:36.720 --> 11:37.560
 Cut it out, cut it out.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.400
 Maintain, bro.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.840
 Here's what I'll say, there's two ways to do it.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.080
 I think it's lame when someone who's done one thing

11:42.080 --> 11:46.200
 for a while goes and starts doing standup out of nowhere.

11:46.200 --> 11:49.560
 Cause I think it's an art form that's under attack

11:49.560 --> 11:51.800
 because it's not like anything else.

11:51.800 --> 11:55.200
 You need, although now you can of course,

11:55.200 --> 11:56.560
 you know, make whatever you want.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.360
 It's the era of self publishing

11:58.360 --> 12:00.840
 as far as making a product and putting it out there,

12:00.840 --> 12:02.480
 which is getting easier, of course.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.040
 And I can't wait to talk to you about that with AI

12:05.040 --> 12:06.400
 and how it's changing art.

12:07.560 --> 12:12.560
 But the, in standup, all you need is a microphone

12:12.560 --> 12:14.840
 and you know, perhaps it would be good

12:14.840 --> 12:16.320
 to have some mental illness

12:16.320 --> 12:20.240
 and then you can just run up there and talk forever.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.000
 And I say this to, you know, comedians.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.400
 It's like, you guys have to deal with just an influx

12:27.400 --> 12:31.000
 of people who aren't sure why they're doing comedy.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.560
 I would ask comedians and like, I mean, not good ones

12:33.560 --> 12:34.760
 and good ones, you know what they're doing,

12:34.760 --> 12:36.080
 but everyone else like, what are you doing?

12:36.080 --> 12:38.080
 Why, why are you doing standup?

12:38.080 --> 12:40.360
 Having said that, I am allergic to money.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.200
 Yeah.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.560
 Do you think they have a good answer for that?

12:42.560 --> 12:43.400
 Why are they doing it?

12:43.400 --> 12:45.080
 Cause I actually like, when I'm in Austin,

12:45.080 --> 12:47.640
 I like going to open mics, just listening.

12:47.640 --> 12:52.480
 It's inspiring to me, both the funny and the unfunny people

12:52.480 --> 12:55.080
 because they've been doing it for several years,

12:55.080 --> 12:56.840
 sometimes over a decade

12:56.840 --> 12:58.160
 and they're still at it.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.000
 They're still right there.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.160
 They're just going for the punch.

13:00.160 --> 13:04.080
 And then especially open mics that are really sad

13:04.080 --> 13:07.400
 in that there is, you know, only like five other people

13:07.400 --> 13:10.160
 in the audience and they're usually just other comedians

13:10.160 --> 13:12.040
 and they're still going all out

13:12.040 --> 13:14.040
 as if they're in front of a stadium.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.760
 But that to me sounds like someone who loves it.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.600
 Yeah.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.280
 I got no questions for that person.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.920
 I got questions for someone who goes sideways

13:21.920 --> 13:24.760
 from here I'm recognizable doing something

13:24.760 --> 13:26.520
 and then I'm doing standup

13:26.520 --> 13:29.560
 because it's like, and truly, look, I've been,

13:29.560 --> 13:30.920
 I've been fortunate enough to be in the business

13:30.920 --> 13:31.760
 for a long time.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.320
 And at this point, if I came up,

13:33.320 --> 13:35.440
 I mean, doing live stuff is fun.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.000
 I have friends that are like, you know,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.480
 some guys who are primarily sketch people

13:40.480 --> 13:42.040
 or you would look at them as sketch people

13:42.040 --> 13:44.200
 and they can sell tickets for being sketch people

13:44.200 --> 13:45.640
 and they, and we'll talk about it.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.840
 And they're like, you know, I do a monologue

13:47.840 --> 13:50.400
 and I do a little standup, then I do a song,

13:50.400 --> 13:51.720
 then I do another monologue,

13:51.720 --> 13:54.320
 then I play off the audience, do a little standup.

13:54.320 --> 13:59.320
 But standup is, it's almost like playing music

13:59.360 --> 14:03.080
 in that, you know, people are going up there playing music

14:03.080 --> 14:04.480
 but what band have you been listening to?

14:04.480 --> 14:06.360
 That's what you're gonna sound like.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.440
 So it's really, I mean, of course,

14:08.440 --> 14:10.480
 I'm speaking from zero experience,

14:10.480 --> 14:12.760
 but I've heard it takes years, of course,

14:12.760 --> 14:16.200
 to find your own voice, standups that when they first go up,

14:16.200 --> 14:19.760
 they're doing some sort of impersonation of so and so

14:19.760 --> 14:22.800
 and so and so and then you gotta pop this audience

14:22.800 --> 14:25.640
 that's paying and you're gonna get run over

14:25.640 --> 14:27.440
 by the next person who's coming up

14:27.440 --> 14:29.800
 and it's hard to follow the last person

14:29.800 --> 14:31.160
 who went up before you.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.520
 And I, I mean, that is a really hard way to,

14:34.520 --> 14:37.280
 it's a very, it's quite a gauntlet to be in

14:37.280 --> 14:38.600
 to find your voice comedically.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.800
 But don't you have that same kind of thing with sketch,

14:40.800 --> 14:42.840
 where you still have to find your own voice

14:42.840 --> 14:44.800
 with like all the impressions you do,

14:44.800 --> 14:46.640
 they're just terrible, you know,

14:46.640 --> 14:49.400
 there are different spins and different people,

14:49.400 --> 14:52.440
 they're not like perfect impressions, right?

14:52.440 --> 14:54.320
 So that's the, I mean,

14:54.320 --> 14:57.720
 that's a similar kind of challenging journey as standup.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.120
 You're just saying they're kind of distinct

15:00.120 --> 15:02.600
 and you fell into this one and you fell in love with it,

15:02.600 --> 15:05.720
 which is like what Mad TV kind of opened you up to.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.360
 Yeah, as a kid, I literally wanted to be an actor.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.040
 I always wanted to be an actor from a very young age,

15:11.040 --> 15:12.320
 as far back as I can remember,

15:12.320 --> 15:15.600
 and I was the class clown and wanted to do comedy stuff

15:15.600 --> 15:17.120
 and comedic acting and...

15:17.120 --> 15:18.240
 So comedic acting.

15:18.240 --> 15:22.840
 Yeah, early on my influences were a very predictable list

15:22.840 --> 15:27.840
 of guys from SETV, early Saturday Night Live,

15:28.720 --> 15:32.600
 Monty Python, all of those performers really influenced me.

15:32.600 --> 15:36.560
 It was later that I saw people like Kevin Klein,

15:36.560 --> 15:38.360
 who's an incredible actor.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.080
 I vividly remember being like 12, 13,

15:41.080 --> 15:44.400
 seeing him get an Academy Award for Fish Called Wanda

15:44.400 --> 15:45.720
 and it blew my mind,

15:45.720 --> 15:47.200
 because I was like, he was hilarious.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.320
 I mean, it was one of my favorite movies back then and now.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.640
 And he won an Academy Award

15:52.640 --> 15:57.640
 and at that point I started thinking more about acting.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.680
 And then I was, like I said, really fortunate to fall in

16:01.680 --> 16:04.120
 with, I mean, I always wanted to do it

16:04.120 --> 16:06.480
 and I was trying to hustle this and that when I was a kid

16:06.480 --> 16:09.440
 and then I ended up getting represented

16:09.440 --> 16:11.720
 and then I ended up on a teen show.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.560
 I was on, basically the easiest way to pitch it

16:14.560 --> 16:17.600
 is it's like a Canadian, my so called life

16:17.600 --> 16:19.480
 with these kids and their lives and stuff.

16:19.480 --> 16:23.520
 And I did that for like five years and I really love acting.

16:23.520 --> 16:27.120
 I really, truly love acting and I don't,

16:27.120 --> 16:30.320
 I'm not someone who wants people to know my opinion.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.200
 So that's another thing about stand up.

16:33.200 --> 16:38.200
 Like I love the illusion of what I get to do in entertainment

16:38.560 --> 16:40.880
 and podcasting is great for that.

16:40.880 --> 16:45.160
 But to stand up there and for, I don't know, just for me

16:45.160 --> 16:48.200
 it's like it would have to all be fantasy.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.200
 And yeah.

16:50.200 --> 16:54.120
 So Nietzsche said that every profound spirit needs a mask.

16:55.320 --> 16:59.520
 Like you said, you don't like to talk about in your comedy,

16:59.520 --> 17:02.600
 you don't like to talk about stuff that's personal to you.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.600
 Yeah.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.800
 What is that?

17:04.800 --> 17:07.200
 If you were to psychoanalyze yourself,

17:07.200 --> 17:10.040
 do you think it's just not something you find funny

17:10.040 --> 17:12.360
 or is it, are you running from something?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.600
 And it's not your fault, Will.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.440
 It's not your fault, Will.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.280
 Speaking of another really great comedic actor

17:21.280 --> 17:23.480
 who's also a serious actor, Rob Williams.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.360
 One of the best serious actors.

17:25.360 --> 17:29.040
 I mean, I mean, I, and you know,

17:29.040 --> 17:30.480
 one of the funniest people of all time,

17:30.480 --> 17:35.000
 but as great, as incredible as he was as a funny man,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.440
 as a stand up and a performer,

17:37.440 --> 17:39.760
 I almost like his serious stuff better.

17:39.760 --> 17:40.920
 Can I ask you a question about that?

17:40.920 --> 17:43.480
 What do you make of the, that he committed suicide?

17:43.480 --> 17:47.240
 I think it's, I mean, it's super depressing.

17:47.240 --> 17:52.240
 I've referred to him as like the Jesus Christ of depression.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.480
 It's almost like he died for others depression,

17:54.480 --> 17:55.800
 you know what I mean?

17:55.800 --> 17:56.640
 Yeah, yeah.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.160
 You'd look at someone like that and go,

17:58.160 --> 17:59.120
 wait a minute, you're a rock star.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.480
 Like you don't, you could just check out

18:01.480 --> 18:03.240
 if you're not liking your life.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.680
 And of course, something like suicide

18:05.680 --> 18:07.120
 begs that you look a little deeper

18:07.120 --> 18:12.120
 and realize how tortured the human mind can make someone.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.000
 Is there some aspect to, you know, we're in LA,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.960
 is there some aspect of celebrity that it's isolating

18:18.960 --> 18:21.280
 that can make you feel really lonely?

18:21.280 --> 18:24.160
 Not me, I don't feel, no, not really.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.680
 You feel the love?

18:25.680 --> 18:28.480
 No, I just feel like I'm not, I mean, it's like,

18:28.480 --> 18:32.080
 I don't know, I've always kind of had a small group of friends

18:32.080 --> 18:34.240
 and those people don't, you know,

18:34.240 --> 18:37.040
 it's like I've known the same people for years and years.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.760
 You never really felt the celebrity, really.

18:38.760 --> 18:42.000
 No, in LA it's hard to, it's hard for people.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.480
 Nobody cares, they see you and then the next minute

18:44.480 --> 18:45.840
 they see so and so.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.600
 So it's like, you know, I'm the guy from that,

18:50.760 --> 18:51.760
 Mike and Molly, right?

18:51.760 --> 18:52.960
 Nope, nope, close.

18:52.960 --> 18:56.080
 King of, you shave your head, you go bald,

18:56.080 --> 18:57.080
 are you king and queens?

18:57.080 --> 18:58.800
 Nope, it's not me.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.800
 So, close.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.160
 You're, wow, shit.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.720
 You used to be the mountain on Game of Thrones.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.320
 You look like shit, what happened?

19:06.320 --> 19:08.600
 Just eating fried dough?

19:08.600 --> 19:09.440
 Yeah.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.000
 Yeah, that's what's up.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.400
 Can't lift any weights anymore.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.120
 I'm at the gym doing like 15 pounds with shoulder press

19:16.120 --> 19:18.120
 and people coming up to me.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.800
 You used to be a dragon killer dude.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.960
 Half a man used to be.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.880
 What's, have there been low points in your life?

19:25.880 --> 19:27.400
 Sorry to go there, but.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:31.000 --> 19:31.840
 Hey.

19:31.840 --> 19:32.680
 Yeah?

19:32.680 --> 19:33.520
 Yeah.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.400
 Yeah.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.600
 Yeah, there's, everybody has a low point in life.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.440
 The opera.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.280
 You suffer from like depression

19:40.280 --> 19:41.120
 and you know, those kinds of things.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.560
 You know what I do, I do.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.760
 I have, I have a bunch of stuff.

19:45.840 --> 19:46.800
 How do you deal with it?

19:46.800 --> 19:48.920
 Said friends, the friends and the.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.280
 They don't do anything for me in that sense.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.120
 Yeah.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.080
 I have a, I have an incredible fiance who,

19:55.080 --> 19:58.320
 that's nice to have somebody constant

19:58.320 --> 20:01.120
 that you love very much and see as the best person

20:01.120 --> 20:04.240
 and all that good stuff, hopefully vice versa.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.080
 And then.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.800
 Well, on your recent Instagram,

20:06.800 --> 20:08.880
 she said that she loves you.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.000
 So, at least allegedly.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.120
 Yeah, allegedly.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.680
 That might all be for, yeah.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.680
 How much money did you pay her to say that?

20:15.680 --> 20:18.160
 I don't, I don't have any cause I'm not a standup.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.840
 I was like, I can do, you got Venmo?

20:20.840 --> 20:21.680
 Yeah, yeah.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.040
 I got, I only have like a hundred and twenty three.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.360
 I give you some Dogecoin.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.360
 Yeah, some Doge.

20:25.360 --> 20:26.200
 Yeah.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.880
 You got, you want some Doge?

20:27.880 --> 20:29.520
 I got some of those monkey NFTs.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.400
 Oh, before I forget.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.400
 Yes.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.760
 Hold on a second.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.360
 Oh, no.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.040
 Put a dude's sticker on your microphone, if that's okay.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.880
 Sure.

20:39.880 --> 20:40.840
 Here.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.680
 Oh, yeah.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.040
 These are tricky cause I have the thumbs of a,

20:44.040 --> 20:45.400
 I have like Italian sausage.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.880
 Don't wait, watch this happen.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.120
 I'm just gonna.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.720
 This will take another.

20:49.720 --> 20:50.560
 Yeah.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.880
 Yeah.

20:51.880 --> 20:52.720
 Oh man.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.560
 Yeah.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.400
 Ooh, this is embarrassing.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.120
 Are you good under pressure?

20:57.120 --> 20:58.640
 I have anxiety.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.800
 I have performance anxiety.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.080
 Do you have anxiety?

21:01.080 --> 21:01.920
 Yeah.

21:01.920 --> 21:02.740
 You have anxiety period?

21:02.740 --> 21:03.580
 Period.

21:03.580 --> 21:06.880
 I don't like it when I, if I have to pee

21:06.880 --> 21:10.000
 and then everyone's waiting in the urinals.

21:10.000 --> 21:10.840
 Yeah.

21:10.840 --> 21:11.680
 I don't like it.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.160
 You know what'll help you in that situation?

21:13.160 --> 21:14.000
 What's that?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.080
 Taking a shit.

21:15.080 --> 21:18.080
 Cause whenever you take a shit, you always pee a little.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.760
 It's hard to take a shit while you're standing at a urinal,

21:20.760 --> 21:21.600
 but.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.760
 Not in my world.

21:22.760 --> 21:23.600
 Okay.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.440
 You just gotta keep yourself full of things

21:24.440 --> 21:25.400
 to make your shit.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.240
 Oh, good.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.000
 Have you ever heard of a banana?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.240
 I did recently, somebody told me about it.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.120
 Not the showbiz term, I'm talking about the food.

21:33.120 --> 21:33.960
 Oh.

21:33.960 --> 21:34.800
 There we go.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.120
 There we go.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.600
 Which way is this way?

21:39.600 --> 21:40.440
 It's like a D.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.280
 No, spin it.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.620
 There you go.

21:42.620 --> 21:43.460
 All right.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.080
 So sexy.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.040
 You're like a brand.

21:50.040 --> 21:50.880
 Yeah.

21:50.880 --> 21:51.920
 It's very important to brand yourself.

21:51.920 --> 21:52.760
 These colors.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.160
 Are you selling shoes?

21:55.080 --> 21:55.920
 Yeah.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.920
 I got some custom kicks coming out.

21:57.920 --> 22:01.880
 The dudes he, no, actually that would be a good idea.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.920
 You can probably sell a pair or two of those.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.600
 Speaking of anxiety, I really am only focused

22:06.600 --> 22:07.600
 on this right now, Alex.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.440
 I apologize.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.440
 Just shit your pants.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.760
 It'll make you be easier.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.120
 Get on with it.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.400
 Oh, this thing has been dog ear to my pocket for a while.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.240
 I swear this never happens to me.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.080
 I'm sorry, babe.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.960
 People don't thumb it a sticker for an hour

22:18.960 --> 22:19.800
 while they're doing the podcast.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.000
 No, this is just an excuse you make

22:21.000 --> 22:23.520
 when you're with somebody and you're underperforming.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.080
 Well, here's the thing.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.640
 As you ask me questions that I don't want to answer,

22:27.640 --> 22:28.480
 I'll just go to this.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.320
 Go go to the sticker.

22:29.320 --> 22:33.040
 So if this ends up working, then I won't have it.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.240
 It's funny how you started doing that

22:34.240 --> 22:35.480
 when we were talking about depression.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.320
 That's weird.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.160
 That is weird.

22:38.160 --> 22:40.120
 Tell me how that makes you feel.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.640
 Here we are.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.480
 We got it.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.520
 For the listener, he succeeded after 10 minutes.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.360
 Yeah.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.040
 No, I do have some of that stuff.

22:51.040 --> 22:56.040
 Bobby Lee had encouraged me on wax as I like to say

22:56.040 --> 22:59.960
 to talk about it on podcasts, talk about depression

22:59.960 --> 23:01.400
 because it could help people.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.000
 And I said, no, but it's true.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.320
 I do have some.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.200
 There's some history in the family.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.600
 How do you overcome it?

23:09.600 --> 23:12.800
 Well, I used to not believe in medication at all.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.760
 I used to think that that was for someone else

23:14.760 --> 23:20.760
 who's been diagnosed with some of the rougher stuff.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.600
 But as I got older, then some of the stuff happens.

23:24.600 --> 23:29.600
 And you have to, and by stuff, I mean mental stuff.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.440
 And yeah, so I went and I just,

23:35.440 --> 23:38.720
 I believe that the stigma needs to be removed completely.

23:38.720 --> 23:39.720
 100%.

23:39.720 --> 23:43.640
 And so I do therapy, I do talk therapy.

23:43.640 --> 23:47.880
 I'm on a little bit of stuff, which let me tell you,

23:47.880 --> 23:51.600
 when I first started it, I was,

23:51.600 --> 23:55.680
 you know, someone I'm close to was like my manager.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.040
 And she goes, this is too much.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.240
 But she was like, yeah, you don't have to white knuckle it

24:00.240 --> 24:01.560
 through life, right?

24:01.560 --> 24:04.840
 Cause I was literally just like everything became,

24:05.680 --> 24:07.640
 you know, really hard to do at a level

24:07.640 --> 24:08.960
 that I wanted to do it at,

24:08.960 --> 24:12.520
 even just getting through your day, right?

24:12.520 --> 24:17.520
 And when I first got some of the meds that I'm on,

24:18.920 --> 24:21.400
 it felt like doors and windows were opening

24:21.400 --> 24:22.560
 literally in my brain.

24:22.560 --> 24:26.800
 I took a three hour nap the first day

24:26.800 --> 24:29.480
 and you shouldn't even feel this stuff the first day.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.520
 I think my brain was like, it was like a sponge.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.640
 It wanted to, I needed some relief.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.040
 And I'm not a nap guy.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.080
 I can sleep three hours and I'll be fine.

24:38.280 --> 24:43.120
 But I took a long nap and then it started to help.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.280
 Yeah, isn't that weird how a little bit of chemistry

24:46.280 --> 24:49.960
 in your head, in case you just make the whole world appear,

24:49.960 --> 24:51.520
 it's so much more beautiful.

24:51.520 --> 24:56.520
 Yeah, I mean, after all, there's a lot going on

24:56.560 --> 24:59.600
 in your brain that can be changed by, you know,

24:59.600 --> 25:01.960
 your lifestyle, but also so many physical things

25:01.960 --> 25:03.840
 like a little bit of meds.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.280
 Or in Bobby's case, you know,

25:06.280 --> 25:08.800
 thumbing around on some dumb farming app.

25:09.680 --> 25:12.400
 Well, Bobby's gone through a few rough periods

25:12.400 --> 25:15.000
 with like, you know, with drugs and alcohol

25:15.000 --> 25:16.520
 and all that kind of stuff.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.800
 And just everything else involved.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.000
 I mean, that's the beautiful roller coaster of who he is

25:21.000 --> 25:23.800
 and a lot of great comedians seem to be that way.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.440
 So I wonder what the connection there is.

25:25.440 --> 25:29.080
 You think some level of crazy is required for comedy?

25:29.080 --> 25:29.920
 Yeah.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.280
 Or like, at some point.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.760
 Yes.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.640
 On a scale of one to 10, how much crazy do you have?

25:37.040 --> 25:39.760
 In some ways, a 10.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.360
 And in other ways that I think,

25:43.200 --> 25:44.920
 in other ways, it's sort of functionally

25:44.920 --> 25:46.880
 on like a two or a three.

25:46.880 --> 25:50.280
 Because I don't know, I'm from Canada and I'm,

25:50.280 --> 25:51.120
 Yeah.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.200
 You know, I try to just keep things very even keeled.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.160
 My parents are Italian, they're from Italy

25:57.160 --> 26:00.160
 and you know, they grew up during World War II

26:00.160 --> 26:04.400
 and they're very, you know, simple outlook on things.

26:04.400 --> 26:08.400
 They're complex, incredible, classy people

26:08.400 --> 26:12.920
 who are very simple when it comes to a lot of stuff.

26:12.920 --> 26:17.320
 And I think just being a sort of a at heart

26:17.320 --> 26:22.320
 kind of a timid Canadian coming out here years ago as a kid,

26:23.280 --> 26:28.280
 it was all I could do to just keep everything super normal.

26:28.680 --> 26:32.360
 And then I sort of was able to settle into that

26:32.360 --> 26:33.680
 as a lifestyle.

26:33.680 --> 26:36.960
 But you love the idea of being an actor.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.040
 Like who, you mentioned John Candy

26:39.040 --> 26:42.560
 and Plains in Automobiles F.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.960
 It's one of my favorite movies, he says, one of yours.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.680
 What do you think that makes that movie work?

26:47.680 --> 26:52.680
 What do you, and when you talk about enjoying that movie,

26:53.320 --> 26:54.960
 do you enjoy just the raw comedy

26:54.960 --> 26:56.680
 or do you enjoy like the friendship

26:56.680 --> 27:01.680
 and the love that's there, even though on the surface,

27:02.240 --> 27:03.320
 it doesn't make any sense

27:03.320 --> 27:05.480
 that there should be a friendship there?

27:05.480 --> 27:08.200
 I mean, that's such an important element to that film.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.440
 But you know, as a kid, I just loved the comedy.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.320
 And then it's been a nostalgic favorite of mine,

27:14.320 --> 27:16.440
 like it's my favorite movie,

27:16.440 --> 27:19.880
 but it's also, it's just legit my favorite movie

27:19.880 --> 27:22.760
 because as you get older and you start watching it,

27:22.760 --> 27:26.440
 you realize it's what John Hughes is the filmmaker

27:26.440 --> 27:29.560
 and what John Candy, particularly,

27:29.560 --> 27:32.240
 and but also Steve Martin are doing in the film

27:32.240 --> 27:33.760
 that makes it such a work of art,

27:33.760 --> 27:38.760
 which is loneliness is there in every moment of that film.

27:38.760 --> 27:43.760
 And John Candy is, he embodies Del Griffith,

27:43.760 --> 27:45.280
 his character in the film.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.720
 Del Griffith is a lonely guy.

27:47.720 --> 27:51.280
 And John Candy, but Del Griffith is also a very friendly guy

27:51.280 --> 27:53.080
 and a shower curtain ring salesman

27:53.080 --> 27:55.160
 and knows everybody in the Midwest

27:55.160 --> 27:56.360
 and runs around to motels

27:56.360 --> 27:59.040
 and has meaningful conversations with the guy,

27:59.040 --> 28:01.600
 even in Gus, whoever he's talking to.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.960
 But there's loneliness there all the time.

28:05.960 --> 28:10.960
 And this is a character, the film is filled with loneliness

28:11.440 --> 28:14.360
 and it's not until the second and last scene

28:14.360 --> 28:19.360
 when he's at the train station, Del, what are you doing here?

28:19.360 --> 28:20.600
 You thought I thought you were going home,

28:20.600 --> 28:21.720
 what are you doing here?

28:22.720 --> 28:26.040
 That's a very good Neil page from the movie.

28:26.040 --> 28:26.880
 Thank you.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.200
 That's when you realize how lonely he is.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.880
 Go ahead and pause and post, yeah.

28:30.880 --> 28:31.720
 Cheers.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.040
 That's when you realize how lonely he is.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.760
 And I think that's the element from the film

28:34.760 --> 28:37.800
 that, I mean, look, you know, nowadays,

28:37.800 --> 28:40.240
 I feel like I've been saying this for a long time,

28:40.240 --> 28:42.760
 but John Candy would have won an Academy Award

28:42.760 --> 28:45.000
 hands down for that film.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.600
 It's just they didn't do that with comedies back then.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.440
 Yeah.

28:48.440 --> 28:49.560
 Until the year after that movie came out

28:49.560 --> 28:50.760
 with Fish Called Wanda.

28:50.760 --> 28:51.600
 Yeah.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.040
 And then it's, I mean, still comedies don't get respected

28:54.040 --> 28:56.280
 enough, Robert Williams, he got,

28:56.280 --> 28:59.880
 I guess he got an Oscar for good hunting.

28:59.880 --> 29:03.400
 Jim Carrey, did he ever get an Oscar?

29:03.400 --> 29:04.960
 I don't know, I don't believe so.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.280
 Yeah, they don't get, you don't,

29:08.280 --> 29:11.720
 but that's not even, if he did, you wouldn't be for comedies.

29:11.720 --> 29:14.600
 It's just, I mean, there's some things that are

29:16.600 --> 29:19.120
 plain strange and ordinary, would you even put that as a,

29:19.120 --> 29:20.120
 I guess it's a comedy.

29:20.120 --> 29:20.960
 Yeah, I mean.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.680
 But there is a loneliness and depth

29:23.680 --> 29:25.040
 that permeates the whole movie.

29:25.040 --> 29:25.880
 Yeah.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.560
 That ultimately, and it's a happy ending,

29:27.560 --> 29:29.640
 which is hard to kinda.

29:29.640 --> 29:33.240
 It's a happy ending only because in the last movie,

29:33.240 --> 29:38.240
 moment of the movie, John Candy puts on a brave face,

29:39.920 --> 29:43.480
 even when he's got no one,

29:43.480 --> 29:46.560
 and he's there seeing Neil Page's entire family

29:46.560 --> 29:49.480
 on Thanksgiving, and he forces a smile,

29:49.480 --> 29:52.400
 which is literally the last frame of the movie.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.280
 And I've said before, if you're not reduced

29:54.280 --> 29:58.680
 to just a sobbing pile of meat at the end of the movie,

29:58.680 --> 29:59.840
 then you are not human.

29:59.840 --> 30:04.360
 Yeah, it is a happy ending.

30:04.360 --> 30:08.360
 It's a happy ending, even though it's a sad, sad character.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.680
 So much loneliness in the world.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.520
 I was just in Vegas.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.880
 I went to diner at like 4 a.m., 5 a.m.,

30:15.880 --> 30:18.880
 and there's a waitress as empty as a waitress.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.200
 That was the sweetest, kindest human being.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.680
 Kept calling me sweetheart and all that kind of stuff, hun.

30:25.720 --> 30:28.120
 And then after I ate, she said,

30:28.120 --> 30:30.360
 darling, just talk to me a little bit.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.800
 Cause there was nobody there,

30:31.800 --> 30:35.040
 and it was just so much sadness in her eyes.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.800
 I don't know, but it's also so much love,

30:36.800 --> 30:39.480
 like that sweetheart, that, I mean,

30:39.480 --> 30:43.800
 it reminded me kind of the John Candy performance,

30:43.800 --> 30:47.760
 because at first, because I was like reading

30:47.760 --> 30:52.760
 a pretty dark book about Hitler.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.880
 So I was a little bit frustrated

30:54.880 --> 30:56.680
 that she kept talking to me,

30:56.680 --> 30:59.520
 cause it was like, it was, it was almost like,

30:59.520 --> 31:01.080
 the same way that John Candy is,

31:01.080 --> 31:02.720
 it's annoying a little bit, right?

31:02.720 --> 31:04.840
 But then very quickly, I opened up to like,

31:04.840 --> 31:07.680
 well, there's a, there's a kind human being,

31:07.680 --> 31:10.160
 and there's like that human connection superseded

31:10.160 --> 31:11.000
 everything else.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.120
 And I don't know, it was just beautiful.

31:12.120 --> 31:16.400
 And I think John Candy captures that really well,

31:16.400 --> 31:19.600
 which is like the connection with other human beings.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.680
 Sometimes we pull away from that

31:22.680 --> 31:27.680
 because we have a busy life full of stuff to do

31:27.800 --> 31:31.000
 as Steve Martin's character, kind of characterized.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.440
 He's like a marketing exec or something like that.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.960
 But if you just pause and notice others,

31:36.960 --> 31:39.880
 you can really discover beautiful people.

31:39.880 --> 31:40.920
 Totally, totally.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.040
 Everyone's got, well, I mean, everyone's got their story.

31:44.040 --> 31:49.040
 And, you know, Candy is a person, I've never met the man,

31:49.040 --> 31:53.960
 but he's the kind of guy that, you know,

31:53.960 --> 31:56.600
 he could just walk up to, back in the day,

31:56.600 --> 31:59.040
 I would imagine he could walk up to just about any house,

31:59.040 --> 32:01.240
 at least in Canada, knock on the door

32:01.240 --> 32:04.160
 and you'd invite him in for dinner, you know what I mean?

32:04.160 --> 32:08.240
 So, yeah, it's a, that, you know,

32:08.240 --> 32:11.520
 as you're talking about, you know, putting a book down

32:11.520 --> 32:12.880
 and talking to someone for a while,

32:12.880 --> 32:15.160
 even though you'd really like to read your book,

32:15.160 --> 32:18.880
 it's like, it's that sort of thing that Candy's character

32:18.880 --> 32:22.200
 in the movie sort of does that, like Johnny Appleseed.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.840
 Just, you realize he's just going around

32:23.840 --> 32:26.520
 making people smile, you know?

32:26.520 --> 32:30.400
 And Neil Page is hanging with this guy, so frustrated.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.600
 He's just, he's so exhausting

32:32.600 --> 32:35.960
 and his big underwear in the sink at the hotel and everything.

32:35.960 --> 32:39.480
 And by the end of it, he loves this guy, you know?

32:39.480 --> 32:43.320
 So, it's a good and a bad thing that you didn't take

32:43.320 --> 32:45.120
 that waitress with you on a trip,

32:45.120 --> 32:47.320
 maybe road trip up to Reno.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.520
 Oh, oh, she's actually, she's out shopping right now.

32:50.520 --> 32:54.560
 We're, we've been having sex multiple times a day ever since.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.400
 Oh, that's nice.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.240
 That's lovely.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.080
 How cute.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.040
 I think I'm sure she's married and happily

32:59.040 --> 33:00.880
 and has many grandchildren.

33:00.880 --> 33:01.720
 Okay.

33:02.840 --> 33:06.120
 And plus that movie's on Thanksgiving, I think, right?

33:06.120 --> 33:06.960
 Yeah, that's right.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.960
 Thanksgiving, so like Thanksgiving just embodies that

33:09.960 --> 33:14.520
 forget about the busyness and the whatever the career

33:14.520 --> 33:17.120
 you're chasing in life and just take a pause

33:17.120 --> 33:18.640
 and appreciate the people you love in life.

33:18.640 --> 33:19.760
 Just be with your family, yeah.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.720
 Or the people, whatever your family looks like.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.360
 Friends, yeah.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.840
 You have some weird friends, unorthodox friends.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.720
 So, at least in the public sphere.

33:29.720 --> 33:30.560
 Oh, yeah.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.360
 From Bob Lee, Brian Cowan, all those kinds of folks

33:33.360 --> 33:36.240
 from the Mad TV days, I'm sure there's others.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.240
 What does it mean to be a good friend?

33:38.240 --> 33:40.240
 Here in LA or just in the world.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.080
 Just in the world.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.160
 In the world, in the world.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.320
 Will Sasse, a world friend.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.840
 I think it is different here.

33:45.840 --> 33:46.680
 I think it is.

33:46.680 --> 33:49.800
 If there's a little bit of a career kind of negotiation,

33:49.800 --> 33:52.880
 shuffling around, that kind of stuff, why is it different?

33:52.880 --> 33:57.960
 Well, I just mean that it's just kind of hard here

33:57.960 --> 34:02.760
 to make time for everybody.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.600
 It's always been a city to me that is like,

34:04.600 --> 34:06.120
 we'll keep you so busy.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.240
 And every time I go home to Vancouver,

34:08.240 --> 34:11.200
 after a few days, I start to get a little stir crazy.

34:11.200 --> 34:15.160
 And I think that being here in LA,

34:15.160 --> 34:17.880
 I go to sleep with 100 things that I still have to do.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.480
 And you're never out of stuff to do.

34:20.480 --> 34:26.120
 And when you ask about your nuts or whatever, if you're crazy,

34:26.120 --> 34:29.240
 I mean, look, all the weirdest people

34:29.240 --> 34:31.280
 from every high school in the United States

34:31.280 --> 34:33.760
 is like, oh, I'm going to make it in LA.

34:33.760 --> 34:35.360
 Everyone just comes here.

34:35.360 --> 34:38.840
 And just another freak in the Freak Kingdom,

34:38.840 --> 34:41.480
 as they say at the end of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.520
 That was a very good Robin Williams impersonation.

34:43.520 --> 34:47.240
 That was my Robin Williams as Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson.

34:47.240 --> 34:47.800
 Yeah.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.520
 It's not your fault, Will.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.120
 It's pretty good.

34:50.120 --> 34:50.640
 Thank you.

34:50.640 --> 34:52.920
 Could have been you, Fear and Loathing.

34:52.920 --> 34:53.720
 And Fear and Loathing?

34:53.720 --> 34:54.640
 Yeah, it'd be interesting.

34:54.640 --> 34:58.960
 I would have liked to play his attorney, the role that Benisha

34:58.960 --> 35:00.520
 del Toro gained weight for.

35:00.520 --> 35:01.560
 That would have been cool.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.080
 He's just saying, what?

35:03.080 --> 35:04.560
 Don't go over the line.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.880
 Like chewing his face off.

35:05.880 --> 35:06.600
 I could have done that.

35:09.880 --> 35:12.320
 Yeah, no, I think that it's backdoor beauty.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.520
 That guy is full of good lines.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.160
 Yeah, it's the beauty for real.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.160
 He's a good actor.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.640
 Yeah, fantastic actor.

35:20.640 --> 35:25.320
 I think what it takes to be a good friend is just presence,

35:25.320 --> 35:26.480
 just being there.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.720
 I mean, that's all anyone needs to be heard, right?

35:29.720 --> 35:33.520
 In LA, it is interesting.

35:33.520 --> 35:37.680
 I haven't seen people that I love in years, some people.

35:37.680 --> 35:38.560
 Just busy.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.040
 Yeah, just busy.

35:39.040 --> 35:43.920
 You still have a depth of connection, even though one

35:43.920 --> 35:45.680
 of the reasons I really enjoy doing a podcast,

35:45.680 --> 35:49.440
 you get to sit down with actual friends of yours

35:49.440 --> 35:51.480
 and spend prolonged periods of time together

35:51.480 --> 35:52.920
 that you don't otherwise.

35:52.920 --> 35:53.760
 That's a good point.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.840
 I've spoken on his podcast to people really close to me.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.200
 And it's like, you've never had a conversation

35:59.200 --> 36:01.480
 without microphones, like you do with microphones.

36:01.480 --> 36:02.400
 It's weird.

36:02.400 --> 36:06.440
 But there's some aspect about LA that a lot of the,

36:06.440 --> 36:09.080
 especially friends of yours, comedians, and so on,

36:09.080 --> 36:10.640
 they'll do podcasts and stuff.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.240
 And there's an intimacy to that.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.160
 Yeah, there is and there isn't.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.280
 The ones that I do, I mean, I just

36:17.280 --> 36:20.040
 did Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino's

36:20.040 --> 36:22.000
 funny enough called Bad Friends.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.280
 Bad Friends.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.800
 And afterwards, and my good pal Chad Colchin,

36:26.800 --> 36:29.960
 with whom I do doodzy, was with me.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.440
 Sneakers are coming soon.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.600
 Sneakers are coming soon.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.440
 You get your will foot and your Chad foot

36:34.440 --> 36:38.520
 comes in a size 15 and a nine and a half.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.400
 And I remember afterwards we were talking.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.920
 It was just basically me, Chad, and Santino were talking.

36:43.920 --> 36:46.920
 And Bobby was over there on his phone.

36:46.920 --> 36:50.920
 And then I was like, I mean, we didn't spend any time

36:50.920 --> 36:53.040
 talking about anything.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.520
 It feels like one of those hours that goes by and you realize,

36:56.520 --> 36:58.520
 I've just been goofing around with these guys, which

36:58.520 --> 36:59.880
 But that's what life is about, right?

36:59.880 --> 37:00.400
 That's fine.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.240
 It's great.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.400
 And then I'm like, all right, Bobby.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.920
 Hey, Bob, I'll see you later.

37:03.920 --> 37:07.120
 And he's like, like this, I'm like, all right, man.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.120
 Hey, love you, bro.

37:08.120 --> 37:08.760
 See you later.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:10.400 --> 37:10.960
 He's a guy.

37:10.960 --> 37:14.720
 Do you ever just, I just send text messages over there

37:14.720 --> 37:17.040
 to him that never come back.

37:17.040 --> 37:19.600
 And then he thinks that I'm angry with him,

37:19.600 --> 37:23.000
 because it's been, it'll go two, three years without him

37:23.000 --> 37:24.160
 getting back to me.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.880
 And then just out of nowhere, hey, fuckface.

37:27.880 --> 37:28.880
 Who says hey, fuckface?

37:28.880 --> 37:29.800
 He does or you do?

37:29.800 --> 37:30.840
 Or you both talk to each other?

37:30.840 --> 37:33.520
 No, I got to be very careful, Bobby.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.240
 Yeah, I got to be very sweet.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.200
 Dear friend.

37:36.200 --> 37:36.760
 Dear friend.

37:36.760 --> 37:37.000
 Hello.

37:37.000 --> 37:37.920
 How are you doing?

37:37.920 --> 37:38.440
 How are you?

37:38.440 --> 37:43.160
 I know I checked in with you, but not but three months ago.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.120
 And then every once in a while, he'll go, hey, fuckface.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.680
 I tend to hide from the world.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.760
 And I can be pretty shady with friends.

37:49.760 --> 37:50.280
 Yeah.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.080
 Yeah.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.560
 I can empathize with Bobby.

37:53.560 --> 37:56.040
 It might be a Skyrim thing.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.200
 It might be like hiding in a world, in a digital world

37:59.200 --> 38:01.360
 with fake NPCs.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.200
 Yeah, yeah, there's that.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.160
 Yeah.

38:05.160 --> 38:09.240
 Yeah, I have a buddy who said something really smart.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.520
 A while ago, we ended up working together

38:11.520 --> 38:13.440
 on this TV show thing.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.320
 And I reached out to him to see if he wanted to do it with us.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.880
 And he did.

38:17.880 --> 38:21.800
 And he goes, this is a great guy, such a funny writer.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.720
 He goes, I may not be in touch all the time,

38:23.720 --> 38:25.280
 but I know who my friends are.

38:25.280 --> 38:26.120
 You know what I mean?

38:26.120 --> 38:28.320
 And it's like in our business, and this

38:28.320 --> 38:32.720
 is a fellow who moved, who's from Ontario, Canada,

38:32.720 --> 38:33.920
 moved back there.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.560
 He's on the farm with his wife and kids.

38:35.560 --> 38:36.960
 And he does not care.

38:36.960 --> 38:38.760
 He's never been a Hollywood guy.

38:38.760 --> 38:41.520
 And it's tough to get old of him.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.920
 But when you do, he's still the same sweet old guy.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.280
 He's doing his thing, though.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.200
 Yeah, yeah, some of my closest friends, even if we

38:48.200 --> 38:51.680
 don't talk for a few months, we'll write back at it if we do.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.600
 And then if shit goes like, if something really traumatic

38:54.600 --> 38:57.840
 happens or difficult stuff or any of that kind of stuff,

38:57.840 --> 38:58.720
 I'm almost there.

38:58.720 --> 39:02.680
 So for important stuff, for important highs,

39:02.680 --> 39:03.920
 and important lows, you're there.

39:03.920 --> 39:04.400
 Yeah.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.160
 And then you pick right back up, especially

39:06.160 --> 39:09.040
 if you have those years of experiences together.

39:09.040 --> 39:09.760
 It's interesting.

39:09.760 --> 39:10.960
 Totally.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.000
 So you've done a couple of podcasts.

39:13.000 --> 39:13.560
 Yeah.

39:13.560 --> 39:13.840
 Done.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.440
 So we've got to talk about Dudesie a little bit.

39:16.440 --> 39:19.000
 But first, you did for several years,

39:19.000 --> 39:20.360
 you did the 10 minute podcast.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.800
 Yeah.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.760
 I mean, everything is hilarious about that podcast,

39:24.760 --> 39:26.880
 including the fact that it's 10 minutes.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.160
 Right.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.000
 I mean, it's ridiculous.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.480
 It's absurd.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.840
 The dynamic is hilarious.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.600
 It's you, Brian Callan, Crystalia.

39:34.600 --> 39:38.160
 I don't know exactly why it works so well,

39:38.160 --> 39:38.760
 but it did.

39:38.760 --> 39:39.760
 It worked really well.

39:39.760 --> 39:42.640
 I think it's because the, yeah, you were having fun,

39:42.640 --> 39:43.280
 probably.

39:43.280 --> 39:46.920
 I mean, that's what really came through,

39:46.920 --> 39:50.480
 that it was friends just talking shit and the tension,

39:50.480 --> 39:53.080
 the beautiful tension, and the absurdity they came out.

39:53.080 --> 39:53.840
 Yeah.

39:53.840 --> 39:54.320
 What?

39:54.320 --> 39:55.560
 Sure.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.920
 What was the story of making that podcast?

39:57.920 --> 39:59.680
 How did that came to be?

39:59.680 --> 40:01.880
 Why do you think it was as good as it was?

40:01.880 --> 40:02.320
 I don't know.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.840
 I feel like that podcast was like,

40:04.840 --> 40:11.920
 it was who we kind of are, but on steroids or something.

40:11.920 --> 40:19.040
 Like each person, Brian's going to be like extra manly and.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.280
 Can you get any more manly than he already is?

40:21.280 --> 40:21.800
 No.

40:21.800 --> 40:22.840
 It's very different.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.760
 He reaches, though.

40:24.760 --> 40:29.200
 And yeah, we just kind of, I feel like as goofballs,

40:29.200 --> 40:31.120
 we knew each other's line.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.240
 Like here's the line you don't cross.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.560
 I feel like those guys don't really have one,

40:35.560 --> 40:37.800
 but at least they knew mine.

40:37.800 --> 40:41.920
 And yeah, we were able to just goof around.

40:41.920 --> 40:45.440
 And I did it with them for three years.

40:45.440 --> 40:48.240
 And then Chad, who I'm doing Dudezy with,

40:48.240 --> 40:51.920
 and my pal Tommy Blacho, who's another writer, producer,

40:51.920 --> 40:53.760
 like Chad, they came on.

40:53.760 --> 40:58.720
 And yeah, all told, I did like seven years of that thing.

40:58.720 --> 41:02.760
 Six, five, six, seven, I don't remember.

41:02.760 --> 41:06.120
 Do you think it ever comes back in some small form

41:06.120 --> 41:09.440
 as a 20 minute podcast or something like that?

41:09.440 --> 41:12.400
 I mean, is there, because it's one of the most requested.

41:12.400 --> 41:15.080
 I mean, you have a huge fan base.

41:15.080 --> 41:16.640
 I'm 47 years old.

41:16.640 --> 41:21.160
 So I am of the generation that had a cell phone,

41:21.160 --> 41:23.760
 has had a cell phone half the time,

41:23.760 --> 41:26.360
 and didn't for the formative years of my life

41:26.360 --> 41:29.800
 into my early 20s.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.920
 And then finally, I got a cell phone,

41:31.920 --> 41:33.560
 I guess I was like 19 or something,

41:33.560 --> 41:35.160
 literally just because of moving to LA.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.080
 You got porn in the mail.

41:37.080 --> 41:37.840
 Yes, that's right.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.120
 It was the hard cover porn.

41:40.120 --> 41:42.080
 That's the way we liked it.

41:42.080 --> 41:46.760
 Bound, nice binding on the porn, leather cover.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.080
 Next to the Bible, yeah.

41:48.080 --> 41:52.520
 Yep, these are all my, these are my Encyclopedia Britannica.

41:52.520 --> 41:53.840
 Wow, very impressive.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.200
 Yes, a man came to the house and sold me these.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.920
 And then down here, these are my,

41:57.920 --> 42:00.080
 this is my pornography.

42:00.080 --> 42:04.680
 If you'll follow me through here to the parlor room, sir.

42:04.680 --> 42:07.640
 Passed through the generations from grandfather to father.

42:07.640 --> 42:09.920
 Yeah, I want to give you something very special

42:09.920 --> 42:11.120
 to me, Nebuchadnezzar.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.840
 So you go up in the generation without a cell phone.

42:15.840 --> 42:20.840
 Yes, it's hard for me to connect with people who hit me up.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.720
 I look at everything as polling.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.560
 So if one person hits me up

42:25.560 --> 42:27.960
 and shares this opinion, but two other people hit me up

42:27.960 --> 42:30.360
 and share that, I'm the worst.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.120
 I don't follow my polls.

42:32.120 --> 42:35.680
 When people say, oh, that poll means absolutely nothing.

42:35.680 --> 42:37.560
 So and so is going to win anyway.

42:37.560 --> 42:38.880
 That's my poll.

42:38.880 --> 42:39.920
 My poll means nothing.

42:39.920 --> 42:41.800
 But I do look at the stuff and go,

42:42.680 --> 42:44.360
 this many people are saying this,

42:44.360 --> 42:47.320
 that means that that number is saying that.

42:47.320 --> 42:51.320
 And yet it's very hard for me to hear

42:51.320 --> 42:53.680
 what the hell people are saying online.

42:53.680 --> 42:56.760
 I really, I can't connect to it sometimes personally.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.880
 So when you say that that's a popular podcast,

42:59.880 --> 43:02.120
 like I know that it's popular

43:02.120 --> 43:04.640
 with the people that have expressed that they love it.

43:04.640 --> 43:05.480
 You know what I mean?

43:05.480 --> 43:07.120
 What does that actually represent?

43:07.120 --> 43:07.960
 I don't know.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.920
 I don't know what kind of people are the audience.

43:09.920 --> 43:10.760
 I don't know.

43:10.760 --> 43:13.080
 I know that the people that listen to Determinative Podcast

43:13.080 --> 43:16.560
 and if you did, thank you, and we're friends.

43:17.920 --> 43:19.960
 I know that it was a special thing

43:19.960 --> 43:22.000
 because it's like, just doing this out of my house

43:22.000 --> 43:24.120
 and we just built it up out of nowhere

43:24.120 --> 43:26.200
 and we're just kind of clowning around.

43:26.200 --> 43:27.600
 It's an odd thing.

43:27.600 --> 43:32.000
 I hope, I think I speak for the two people

43:32.000 --> 43:34.080
 that have reached out to you that said you should do it

43:34.080 --> 43:35.280
 or whatever, three people.

43:35.280 --> 43:38.440
 The poll that you should bring it back at some point.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.280
 That would be beautiful.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.120
 Oh my God.

43:40.120 --> 43:45.040
 It's like, what's a good story of like a famous band

43:45.040 --> 43:46.680
 that came back and was successful?

43:46.680 --> 43:47.520
 Probably, well.

43:47.520 --> 43:48.360
 Nirvana?

43:48.360 --> 43:51.520
 No, it wasn't Nirvana.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.280
 Sorry, I got Nirvana mixed up with Aerosmith.

43:54.280 --> 43:55.120
 Yeah.

43:55.120 --> 43:55.960
 It was Aerosmith.

43:55.960 --> 43:56.800
 It was Aerosmith.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.040
 Yeah, they had that second ride.

43:58.040 --> 43:58.880
 Different.

43:58.880 --> 44:01.760
 Yeah, totally different ending of those two bands.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.800
 One ended up on American Idol.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.120
 Yeah.

44:06.120 --> 44:08.960
 A lot of interesting women involved in that one too.

44:08.960 --> 44:09.800
 All right.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.760
 How did Dudezy come to be?

44:12.760 --> 44:13.600
 Dudezy.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.560
 And what the hell is Dudezy?

44:14.560 --> 44:16.320
 Dudezy is the first podcast

44:16.320 --> 44:19.360
 and this is exciting that you've asked me to come here today

44:19.360 --> 44:22.280
 because to hear what you would have to say about it

44:22.280 --> 44:23.360
 or what you would ask about it,

44:23.360 --> 44:27.000
 it is the first podcast that is run completely by

44:27.000 --> 44:31.160
 and essentially, I like to say curated by an AI.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.680
 We were approached by a company

44:33.680 --> 44:35.440
 that had this proprietary AI

44:35.440 --> 44:38.200
 that wants to develop the podcast into the future

44:38.200 --> 44:40.720
 and figure out exactly what it takes

44:40.720 --> 44:42.840
 to make the best podcast ever.

44:42.840 --> 44:47.840
 And it was all we knew from the top

44:47.840 --> 44:49.680
 and what they really wanted was two people

44:49.680 --> 44:51.720
 who were actually friends

44:51.720 --> 44:54.960
 and could be meaningful in the podcast space

44:54.960 --> 44:56.880
 based on whatever information they had.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.120
 Is the company CIA

44:58.120 --> 45:00.000
 and are they testing technology

45:00.000 --> 45:02.560
 to control the populace through chatbots?

45:02.560 --> 45:05.120
 I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to share that information.

45:05.120 --> 45:07.400
 You are, yeah, who gave you the suit?

45:07.400 --> 45:09.120
 Where did you get the suit?

45:09.120 --> 45:10.400
 Where did you get the suit, Will?

45:10.400 --> 45:11.240
 Yeah, well, this is...

45:11.240 --> 45:12.080
 This is J.C. Penny.

45:12.080 --> 45:14.200
 CIA stands for something different in here.

45:14.200 --> 45:15.720
 I mean, you know, it doesn't mean like

45:15.720 --> 45:18.000
 the Central Intelligence Agency,

45:18.000 --> 45:18.840
 and probably it's just...

45:18.840 --> 45:19.680
 It's a different...

45:19.680 --> 45:20.640
 Yeah, it's a...

45:20.640 --> 45:22.120
 Canadian information...

45:22.120 --> 45:24.400
 Canadian international apparel.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.320
 Yeah, the Canadian international apparel company

45:26.320 --> 45:27.840
 hit us up, Chad and I.

45:29.640 --> 45:31.400
 Well, Chad's a super weirdo.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.880
 You would get a kick out of him, I know.

45:32.880 --> 45:36.440
 You guys, you strike me as very similar in some ways.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.640
 I'll take that as a compliment, by the way.

45:37.640 --> 45:38.640
 It is, and it is.

45:39.880 --> 45:40.720
 And it is.

45:40.720 --> 45:41.960
 And if I was friends with you

45:41.960 --> 45:43.320
 for as long as I've been with Chad,

45:43.320 --> 45:45.360
 perhaps I'd have some horrible shit to say about you.

45:45.360 --> 45:48.680
 But the good parts, you remind me of him.

45:48.680 --> 45:50.640
 And we were approached by this company

45:50.640 --> 45:52.400
 that said, we have this AI,

45:52.400 --> 45:55.640
 and we would like to set it loose on you.

45:55.640 --> 46:00.640
 And essentially, we had to hand over some information

46:00.960 --> 46:04.880
 that would allow the AI to access our email

46:04.880 --> 46:07.760
 and look at our search histories, purchase histories,

46:07.760 --> 46:10.960
 things like this, and really dig into...

46:10.960 --> 46:12.040
 Pornhub included, or not?

46:12.040 --> 46:16.320
 Pornhub, yeah, I had to hand over all my leatherbound

46:16.320 --> 46:18.040
 1970s pornography.

46:19.360 --> 46:22.880
 And essentially, it curates a podcast for us every week,

46:22.880 --> 46:25.960
 doing dumb things like, it says,

46:25.960 --> 46:29.880
 hey, Will, you do some shitty Hulk Hogan impersonation.

46:29.880 --> 46:32.040
 Podcasts about news are very popular.

46:32.040 --> 46:34.720
 This is Infomania, you know what I mean?

46:34.720 --> 46:35.960
 Oh, let me tell you something about that

46:35.960 --> 46:37.200
 Marjorie Taylor Green dude,

46:37.200 --> 46:39.440
 and then he's going on doing some new stuff.

46:39.440 --> 46:42.400
 And it basically just spits out all these things

46:42.400 --> 46:43.360
 that it wants us to do,

46:43.360 --> 46:45.920
 normally four segments in episode,

46:45.920 --> 46:47.040
 and that's pretty much it.

46:47.040 --> 46:48.360
 It just tells us what to do.

46:48.360 --> 46:49.800
 It generates the premise.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.520
 I mean, you've spoken a bit here and there.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.560
 Like I said, I'm a huge fan.

46:54.560 --> 46:55.520
 I don't even remember where,

46:55.520 --> 46:59.160
 but you talked about that you enjoy Dudezy

46:59.160 --> 47:04.160
 because you feel almost liberated to...

47:04.240 --> 47:06.880
 Because you're operating within the constraints

47:06.880 --> 47:08.480
 of the premise it generates.

47:08.480 --> 47:09.840
 So you're almost not,

47:11.200 --> 47:14.320
 you're free to riff, essentially.

47:14.320 --> 47:16.720
 Yeah, like you don't need to do the job

47:16.720 --> 47:19.800
 of like coming up with the weird.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.720
 You can just, the weird is given to you

47:21.720 --> 47:23.240
 and then you just run with it.

47:23.240 --> 47:24.440
 That's a good way to say it

47:24.440 --> 47:26.800
 because we're already weird, Chad and I.

47:26.800 --> 47:29.560
 Chad can talk for days about all sorts of stuff.

47:29.560 --> 47:31.720
 He's particularly interested in AI lately

47:31.720 --> 47:32.920
 and its effect on art.

47:32.920 --> 47:36.240
 He is a writer, books, movies and TV shows.

47:36.240 --> 47:40.840
 And I'm primarily acting and trying to come up with stuff.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.480
 Stuff I write with Chad's pretty good.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.040
 The rest of it hasn't seen much success.

47:44.040 --> 47:47.320
 Anyway, Nora's the stuff with Chad for that matter.

47:47.320 --> 47:49.640
 But that's because of me.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.440
 Sneakers, do you never know?

47:51.440 --> 47:53.080
 Oh, I can't wait for these sneakers.

47:53.080 --> 47:54.160
 Only in two sizes.

47:54.160 --> 47:55.240
 Yeah, only in two sizes.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.840
 You're gonna be able to take the tongue.

47:57.840 --> 47:58.880
 You can't take it out

47:58.880 --> 48:00.360
 because it's actually stitched in.

48:00.360 --> 48:01.200
 Yeah.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.040
 It's pretty cool stuff.

48:03.040 --> 48:06.880
 Velcro or... Yeah, Velcro.

48:06.880 --> 48:07.920
 Velcro up the side.

48:07.920 --> 48:10.920
 We're doing some like brand new Kanye stuff.

48:10.920 --> 48:12.720
 Yeah, we want things to look like

48:12.720 --> 48:15.760
 this is what you'll be wearing on Mars when you get there.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.920
 So Nike's doing a bunch of research for running

48:18.920 --> 48:20.280
 how to make a super light shoe

48:20.280 --> 48:21.520
 that you can be efficient in

48:21.520 --> 48:23.120
 and break all kinds of running records.

48:23.120 --> 48:24.480
 So you're doing the same kind of stuff.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.520
 We're doing the same kind of thing for the podcasting space.

48:26.520 --> 48:27.800
 The best kind of shoes to sit around

48:27.800 --> 48:29.560
 and talk to your pal in.

48:29.560 --> 48:33.080
 But yeah, so this, yeah, it's bizarre.

48:33.080 --> 48:34.400
 And it also does some writing.

48:34.400 --> 48:36.560
 Dudezy does come up with things,

48:36.560 --> 48:40.680
 but not unlike what we're seeing in AI art now.

48:40.680 --> 48:41.640
 It's a little bit foggy.

48:41.640 --> 48:44.480
 It's a little bit weird, but it is improving.

48:44.480 --> 48:47.600
 It is learning about us and writing stuff

48:47.600 --> 48:49.800
 when it makes me spit this and that,

48:49.800 --> 48:52.000
 which we'll read, you know,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.840
 I've prepared these things for you to read.

48:54.840 --> 48:57.480
 It's impossible not to get a kick out of it

48:57.480 --> 48:59.840
 because Chad and I are, first of all, we're blown away

48:59.840 --> 49:01.640
 that we're doing this.

49:01.640 --> 49:04.520
 And second of all, some of the stuff is actually very funny.

49:04.520 --> 49:06.360
 It makes weird names.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.080
 Like, I don't think it understands,

49:10.240 --> 49:11.840
 it messes up some words and stuff,

49:11.840 --> 49:13.160
 but that makes it even funnier.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.960
 And then it sort of, from the beginning,

49:15.960 --> 49:19.880
 started laying on, like it says astonishing all the time.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.080
 Everything is astonishing.

49:22.080 --> 49:23.840
 That's Dudezy's favorite word.

49:23.840 --> 49:28.840
 But yeah, it's basically just a way to frame the podcast.

49:30.080 --> 49:30.920
 You know what I mean?

49:30.920 --> 49:34.760
 Because my thing is, I don't want to do this.

49:34.760 --> 49:36.680
 We're actually have to talk to someone.

49:36.680 --> 49:41.680
 You seem to feel a burden of the long form conversation.

49:42.160 --> 49:45.040
 It seems like, is that really hard work for you?

49:45.040 --> 49:45.880
 No, not at all.

49:45.880 --> 49:47.440
 It's just that I don't like to bore people.

49:47.440 --> 49:51.600
 And I feel like if I go on and I like to provide value

49:51.600 --> 49:54.560
 for who, for what I am, you know,

49:54.560 --> 49:57.840
 your value with regard to this project

49:57.840 --> 50:01.280
 is obviously warranted, it's obviously.

50:01.280 --> 50:02.680
 I'm waiting for the explanation

50:02.680 --> 50:04.520
 for what the value is exactly.

50:04.520 --> 50:05.640
 Two dudes in a suit.

50:05.640 --> 50:07.880
 No, listen, yeah, two dudes in a suit.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.080
 No, but I mean, you've got your audience

50:10.080 --> 50:11.280
 and that's the end of that.

50:11.280 --> 50:12.760
 People find value in it.

50:12.760 --> 50:16.440
 For me, I do feel like I'm,

50:17.520 --> 50:20.240
 it is important that I,

50:20.240 --> 50:23.400
 if I'm going to do something that, you know,

50:23.400 --> 50:26.840
 is going to be funny or that I hope is funny,

50:26.840 --> 50:30.840
 I just kind of want to get in and out of someone's day

50:30.840 --> 50:34.320
 and just kind of, I like making, I like making laughy.

50:34.320 --> 50:36.280
 I want people to, you know, whatever.

50:36.280 --> 50:38.160
 It's the same thing that anyone else will tell you.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.400
 Yeah, but in the long form, you feel the anxiety.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.160
 You did a few funny things

50:42.160 --> 50:44.400
 and I wonder if I can keep doing the funny thing.

50:44.400 --> 50:46.880
 Is that why you're, you feel that,

50:46.880 --> 50:50.160
 like why is doozy relieving you of some of the anxiety?

50:52.080 --> 50:54.040
 Well, in some ways it gives me anxiety

50:54.040 --> 50:56.320
 because I don't know what's coming.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.640
 And that's weird for me

50:57.640 --> 51:01.400
 because I like to prepare for things.

51:01.400 --> 51:04.360
 But it's, that's not what podcasting is.

51:04.360 --> 51:07.000
 Podcasting, you need to just be malleable

51:07.000 --> 51:09.120
 and say whatever and do whatever.

51:10.160 --> 51:13.800
 And that's what makes it a real,

51:13.800 --> 51:16.200
 I mean, it's, look, it's a medium for conversation.

51:16.200 --> 51:19.040
 And if you're driving along listening to this

51:19.040 --> 51:21.200
 or anything else, you're, you know,

51:21.200 --> 51:23.080
 it is that it's the,

51:23.080 --> 51:25.080
 it's the true meaning of the parasocial relationship

51:25.080 --> 51:27.400
 because the best podcasts just make you feel like

51:27.400 --> 51:29.080
 you're sitting around rapping.

51:29.080 --> 51:30.600
 We're just having a conversation.

51:30.600 --> 51:31.600
 You could even be sitting there,

51:31.600 --> 51:34.200
 agreeing or talking out loud to yourself if you want.

51:34.200 --> 51:35.480
 You could just be sitting in silence.

51:35.480 --> 51:36.880
 Or you could just be sitting in silence

51:36.880 --> 51:40.960
 in your fancy podcasting shoes, podcasting audience shoes.

51:40.960 --> 51:43.840
 It's a very different build than running shoes.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.960
 Would they be also called doozy, the shoes?

51:45.960 --> 51:47.840
 Yeah, they'll be doozy shoes.

51:47.840 --> 51:48.680
 Doozy shoes.

51:48.680 --> 51:49.520
 That's very creative.

51:49.520 --> 51:50.760
 Yeah.

51:50.760 --> 51:54.160
 Well, one thing the AI isn't good at yet is branding.

51:54.160 --> 51:55.760
 Everything is just doozy this and that.

51:55.760 --> 51:57.640
 I would argue that's pretty good branding.

51:57.640 --> 51:58.480
 I don't know.

51:58.480 --> 52:00.480
 Well, doozy allows me to just,

52:00.480 --> 52:03.720
 it forces me to sit down with Chad

52:03.720 --> 52:07.760
 and goof around for an hour or an hour plus.

52:07.760 --> 52:11.080
 And, and it provides the parameters

52:11.080 --> 52:14.360
 that I a lot of times ignore because I'm,

52:14.360 --> 52:16.320
 I think that podcasting is just two dudes

52:16.320 --> 52:18.360
 shitting around or three or four.

52:18.360 --> 52:23.360
 But it sits me down and gives me a premise

52:23.840 --> 52:25.080
 to work with.

52:25.080 --> 52:26.320
 And then you just riff with it.

52:26.320 --> 52:27.160
 Yeah.

52:27.160 --> 52:27.980
 It's fun.

52:27.980 --> 52:29.240
 It's been a hoot.

52:29.240 --> 52:31.120
 So from the acting perspective,

52:32.280 --> 52:34.160
 you know, a lot of people like Daniel Day Lewis

52:34.160 --> 52:36.880
 will see acting just like as you described,

52:36.880 --> 52:39.000
 which is you have your roles,

52:39.000 --> 52:40.840
 you embrace those roles and then you disappear.

52:40.840 --> 52:44.160
 You don't, you don't, you don't do podcasts.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.960
 You don't do any of that kind of stuff.

52:45.960 --> 52:47.640
 Your art is your art.

52:47.640 --> 52:51.560
 So is that, is that part of you feels that way?

52:51.560 --> 52:53.200
 I think so.

52:53.200 --> 52:54.400
 Is that the actor side of you?

52:54.400 --> 52:55.360
 Yeah.

52:55.360 --> 52:58.760
 Anytime I get to do something that I don't get a chance

52:58.760 --> 53:02.440
 to do much of or something that people haven't seen me do

53:02.440 --> 53:04.720
 much of or that I've done on some scale

53:04.720 --> 53:06.360
 that hasn't been very wide

53:06.360 --> 53:08.040
 and not a lot of people have seen it.

53:08.040 --> 53:10.440
 That's the stuff that I get really excited about.

53:10.440 --> 53:14.840
 I don't know why I'm,

53:14.840 --> 53:17.480
 I don't know why, I don't know why necessarily

53:17.480 --> 53:19.160
 I haven't answered that question yet in my life,

53:19.160 --> 53:20.800
 like what it is about being an actor

53:21.840 --> 53:25.320
 that I love so much because it's not like I don't like to,

53:25.320 --> 53:27.280
 it's not like I'm trying to get away from myself

53:27.280 --> 53:30.120
 and play other characters and stuff and not be myself.

53:31.560 --> 53:34.600
 But it is, it has always been fun to,

53:34.600 --> 53:37.800
 to just be other people and escape.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.800
 Yeah. Is there some aspect to the impressions

53:39.800 --> 53:42.920
 where you become that person?

53:42.920 --> 53:46.000
 Is that like, what's that like to,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.920
 I suppose acting is a full on version of that.

53:48.920 --> 53:53.920
 You've really at its best become the character.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.840
 Is there some fun in that?

53:55.840 --> 53:57.000
 Yeah, absolutely.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.960
 If you can play a character for long enough

54:01.160 --> 54:05.720
 and then jump out of it, that's a lot of fun.

54:05.720 --> 54:08.680
 Like I did this movie like four or five years ago

54:08.680 --> 54:12.680
 called the inside game about the NBA gambling scandal

54:12.680 --> 54:15.920
 that there's a Netflix documentary about it right now.

54:15.920 --> 54:20.920
 And that character, I played Jimmy Batista,

54:21.760 --> 54:25.120
 Baba the sheep, who's, you know,

54:25.120 --> 54:28.720
 this guy was this bookie and rah rah rah and it's a very,

54:28.720 --> 54:30.960
 he's, there's a lot going on with him.

54:30.960 --> 54:34.480
 He's, you know, he's running numbers with the mob and stuff

54:34.480 --> 54:36.720
 and there's a lot of money changing hands.

54:36.720 --> 54:39.560
 That character was so, I got to be,

54:39.560 --> 54:41.160
 get so deep into that character

54:41.160 --> 54:43.840
 that coming out of it was, was a little odd.

54:43.840 --> 54:48.160
 Or as weird as this sounds, the Three Stooges was hard for me

54:48.160 --> 54:53.000
 to, I found that I had some of Curly's mannerisms

54:53.000 --> 54:55.960
 just automatically I could not stop them.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.640
 When people, when I would talk to people, they would,

54:58.640 --> 55:01.520
 they would come out, I wasn't, I'm not doing it on purpose.

55:01.520 --> 55:02.360
 I don't want to do that.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.520
 Like I'm ready to shed it.

55:04.520 --> 55:08.280
 Cause I've been working on it for months and months

55:08.280 --> 55:10.600
 at that point, as far as getting the thing down

55:10.600 --> 55:12.560
 and then you, then you got to shoot.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.560
 And then for me, it's always,

55:14.560 --> 55:17.280
 I always want to change the stuff I did the day before.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.760
 I'm like that, where I'm like,

55:18.760 --> 55:20.480
 I could have done it better and this and that.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.440
 And that stayed with you.

55:22.440 --> 55:23.640
 That character stayed with you a little bit.

55:23.640 --> 55:24.480
 Totally.

55:24.480 --> 55:25.320
 Yeah.

55:25.320 --> 55:27.080
 I just feel like with actors,

55:27.080 --> 55:29.320
 sometimes when you listen to interviews,

55:29.320 --> 55:33.760
 they have spent so much time sort of living inside

55:33.760 --> 55:35.360
 other characters that they,

55:35.360 --> 55:39.160
 they almost don't have a depth of personality themselves.

55:39.160 --> 55:42.160
 Like a depth, like, I don't mean that as a negative thing.

55:42.160 --> 55:44.480
 It's just like, it feels like the art form at its best

55:44.480 --> 55:47.240
 is pretending to be other people or like,

55:47.240 --> 55:49.200
 and even pretending sounds negative,

55:49.200 --> 55:52.320
 but like bringing certain characters to life.

55:52.320 --> 55:53.160
 Yeah.

55:53.160 --> 55:54.000
 That's the art form.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.320
 Look, a weird thing happened while we were doing Stooges

55:57.320 --> 55:59.760
 cause you've got a very heavy blueprint.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.240
 We're following this very clear blueprint

56:02.240 --> 56:04.960
 that the Stooges left for everybody.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.760
 And for Stooges fans and people enjoying the movie,

56:07.760 --> 56:08.760
 it's gotta be this,

56:08.760 --> 56:11.280
 you take your toolbox that you're used to bringing

56:11.280 --> 56:14.520
 to a comedy movie, you leave it behind.

56:14.520 --> 56:16.600
 The only tools I'm bringing are the ones that he used.

56:16.600 --> 56:20.280
 And a weird thing started happening where I would,

56:20.280 --> 56:22.000
 I always saw the whole thing happening

56:22.000 --> 56:24.640
 with the real Stooges in black and white.

56:24.640 --> 56:26.480
 So if we're about to shoot a scene,

56:26.480 --> 56:28.600
 I would just, you know, think about,

56:28.600 --> 56:30.160
 I'm gonna start from all the other preparation,

56:30.160 --> 56:31.280
 you know, you know everything

56:31.280 --> 56:32.160
 and what you're supposed to do.

56:32.160 --> 56:34.320
 And I've been watching so much of it.

56:34.320 --> 56:35.760
 And the three of us are,

56:35.760 --> 56:37.600
 we're pretty much left to come up

56:37.600 --> 56:41.120
 with a lot of the striking combinations and all the stuff,

56:41.120 --> 56:43.560
 which is all real smack and all this crap.

56:43.560 --> 56:46.400
 And the stuff that we were doing that was very Stooges,

56:46.400 --> 56:48.080
 you're preparing all that stuff,

56:48.080 --> 56:49.440
 but something else was happening

56:49.440 --> 56:51.080
 before you jump into a scene

56:51.080 --> 56:53.440
 and the unknown of now we're shooting it.

56:53.440 --> 56:57.600
 And here are these parameters within to shoot the scene.

56:57.600 --> 57:00.280
 I could still see it as them doing it.

57:00.280 --> 57:02.960
 So much so that when I saw the movie at the premiere,

57:02.960 --> 57:05.280
 I was like, who's this big fuck doing,

57:05.280 --> 57:07.000
 because I'm not Curly to me.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.520
 Curly is Curly.

57:08.520 --> 57:09.360
 But I feel like.

57:09.360 --> 57:11.240
 I see you're seeing yourself in black and white almost.

57:11.240 --> 57:12.880
 I was seeing him.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.520
 Yeah, I was only seeing him.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.560
 So channeling is some fundamental way.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.200
 In some weird way, you're channeling him

57:19.200 --> 57:21.160
 because you've seen so much of it.

57:21.160 --> 57:26.160
 The only thing you know about Jerome Lester Horowitz is Curly.

57:26.160 --> 57:29.040
 I'm not saying he was exhumed or something or a spirit

57:29.040 --> 57:32.120
 when he made some weird, you know, crystal mommy shit like that.

57:32.120 --> 57:33.960
 I'm saying that this,

57:33.960 --> 57:35.360
 because you know so much of it

57:35.360 --> 57:38.600
 and because of the heavy blueprint that they left with you,

57:38.600 --> 57:43.440
 you are, you're channeling what that person does.

57:43.440 --> 57:47.080
 And you're, I was seeing entire scenes, you know,

57:47.080 --> 57:49.760
 before you do them the way he would do it.

57:49.760 --> 57:51.040
 And then you want a couple of takes

57:51.040 --> 57:53.240
 to make sure that you're doing it right.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.280
 But that was hard.

57:54.280 --> 57:57.680
 That one was hard to let go of, some of them are.

57:57.680 --> 57:59.720
 Do you think Larry David, who was also in there,

57:59.720 --> 58:02.320
 dressed as a nun, also had trouble letting go of that?

58:02.320 --> 58:05.760
 We mentioned clothes make the man think that worked for him

58:05.760 --> 58:06.760
 in that case.

58:06.760 --> 58:08.360
 Man, you know, he.

58:08.360 --> 58:09.760
 Was it like working with the guy?

58:09.760 --> 58:11.480
 Come on, he's the greatest.

58:11.480 --> 58:15.120
 And he's a, he's a big stooge, he's a stooge fan.

58:15.120 --> 58:17.080
 And him and Pete fairly are good friends.

58:17.080 --> 58:19.120
 And then, but then Larry David has to show up

58:19.120 --> 58:21.280
 and hang out with us for a couple of weeks.

58:21.280 --> 58:23.480
 He's like, I didn't realize it was going to take too long

58:23.480 --> 58:25.680
 until I realized it was going to take this long, you know.

58:25.680 --> 58:28.040
 But, ah, shit, I gotta be out here in Atlanta.

58:28.040 --> 58:29.840
 It's boiling hot.

58:29.840 --> 58:33.960
 But at one point there was this line where he kept doing a,

58:33.960 --> 58:35.600
 he would just spit a different line every time.

58:35.600 --> 58:37.120
 He was like getting hit in the head with something.

58:37.120 --> 58:39.400
 He's laying there on the ground and he goes,

58:39.400 --> 58:42.160
 he like comes to and he says, at one point he goes,

58:43.240 --> 58:46.600
 Miami audiences are the best audiences in the world.

58:46.600 --> 58:47.440
 Right?

58:47.440 --> 58:48.680
 And cause he's loopy.

58:48.680 --> 58:53.600
 Now he's playing a nun at the, at the orphanage

58:53.600 --> 58:55.560
 where the three stooges grew up.

58:55.560 --> 58:57.600
 And I'm super intimidated by Larry David.

58:57.600 --> 59:00.240
 He's a genius and stuff and, and, and,

59:00.240 --> 59:02.800
 but I walk up to him and I go, ah, so he's,

59:02.800 --> 59:06.080
 what is he like a, like a borscht belt Florida comedian

59:06.080 --> 59:08.000
 who is on the lamb.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.520
 And so he's dressing as a woman.

59:09.520 --> 59:11.320
 He ends up at an orphanage.

59:11.320 --> 59:12.560
 Like what's going on there?

59:12.560 --> 59:15.760
 And he just, and he looks at me and just goes, yeah.

59:15.760 --> 59:20.760
 Like, I'm like, ah, he's got some like actor motivation.

59:20.800 --> 59:24.320
 Like, of course he looks, it's Larry David

59:24.320 --> 59:26.800
 in a nun's habit, which is hilarious.

59:26.800 --> 59:29.840
 That's such a Pete fairly casting thing.

59:29.840 --> 59:32.840
 It's, you know, and he, but he's doing this whole like,

59:32.840 --> 59:35.600
 what a warm audience, you know, like, like, oh,

59:35.600 --> 59:38.480
 he's like this cat skill comedian who's been living in,

59:38.480 --> 59:39.240
 you know,

59:39.240 --> 59:41.720
 So that's what he's like living through in his mind

59:41.720 --> 59:43.280
 is just having fun with it, right?

59:43.280 --> 59:46.640
 I mean, that and probably a combination of that

59:46.640 --> 59:48.120
 and getting the lines right.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.680
 Cause he's like, what are we doing here?

59:49.680 --> 59:52.120
 What is, you know, just frustrated all day

59:52.120 --> 59:53.720
 with what the heck we're trying to do.

59:53.720 --> 59:54.560
 What do you think makes,

59:54.560 --> 59:58.400
 I mean, that guy is one of the best improv people ever.

59:58.400 --> 59:59.240
 Yeah.

59:59.240 --> 1:00:00.320
 So what do you think makes him so good?

1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:04.160
 Like, why is it so compelling to watch that guy?

1:00:04.160 --> 1:00:05.440
 Because he's a comedic genius.

1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:07.760
 Like he literally, he knows what he does.

1:00:07.760 --> 1:00:10.360
 He's been a writer for 50 years or whatever.

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:13.520
 And he's, and he just happens to be that brilliant.

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:15.880
 I mean, I've gotten a chance just to do,

1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:18.760
 I did just an episode of Kerb, a small part,

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:21.400
 and it's crazy what he sees.

1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:22.840
 I don't know what he sees.

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:24.160
 As a matter of fact,

1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:26.760
 so I auditioned for it for Kerb,

1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:28.680
 like, you know, two or three times, right?

1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:30.040
 And never got anything.

1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:32.880
 And then it was only after working with him on the Stooges

1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:35.400
 that I got a call to do a bit part.

1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:36.720
 But I remember auditioning.

1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:39.240
 You go into that, into that room

1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:43.680
 and the guys waiting are all people that you know.

1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:45.920
 You're like, oh, I know them, I know her, I know him.

1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:50.280
 And so I went in, I auditioned for this, for this part.

1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:53.640
 And the only thing I know of the thing is like,

1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:57.080
 okay, so you really wanna go to this play with me.

1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:58.520
 You really wanna go to this play.

1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:01.000
 And when you hear that I have an extra ticket,

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.800
 you sincerely wanna think, and I'm like, got it.

1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:04.640
 And so.

1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:05.480
 That's the premise.

1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:06.320
 The premise of the scene.

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:07.160
 And that's all you know.

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:08.000
 That's all I know.

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.320
 So he goes, he does his bit

1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:11.880
 and I'm just supposed to come in and interrupt

1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:14.080
 and I'm like, excuse me, I couldn't help

1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:16.080
 but hear you guys were talking about, you know,

1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:18.520
 whatever the play was or, you know, death of a salesman.

1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:21.320
 I am, I'm a huge fan of that play.

1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:22.920
 I mean, if it's not, if it's not,

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:24.320
 if you're looking for someone to take a ticket,

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:26.240
 I would love to go.

1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:27.480
 My name's so and so, by the way.

1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:29.040
 And he goes, I'm gonna stop you.

1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:29.880
 I'm gonna stop you.

1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:32.960
 And I'm like, he goes, are you really,

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:35.160
 I mean, you truly wanna go to this play.

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:36.960
 And I go, yes, yes, sir.

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:38.400
 You really wanna go.

1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:41.480
 You actually, this is, you would love to do this.

1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:44.240
 I go, okay, let's try it again.

1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:45.280
 So then he's like, no, no, no, no.

1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:47.080
 And I go, hey, excuse me, I'm sorry.

1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:47.920
 I don't mean to interrupt.

1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:50.560
 I was just, I couldn't help it over here.

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:52.280
 You have a ticket to the thing.

1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:54.040
 I am the biggest fan of that.

1:01:54.040 --> 1:01:55.040
 I do the same thing.

1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:56.520
 I'm gonna stop you again.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:57.360
 Okay.

1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:00.480
 I mean, you really wanna go to this play.

1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:01.640
 He's fucking with me, right?

1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:02.480
 Yeah.

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:03.720
 I remember Jeff Garland was sitting there

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:04.560
 in the audition.

1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:05.400
 He goes, he did it.

1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:06.240
 He said it.

1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:07.080
 Oh, shut up.

1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:07.900
 No, hold on.

1:02:07.900 --> 1:02:10.000
 Listen, you really wanna go, okay.

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.360
 Three, four times, you know, there I am.

1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:13.560
 I couldn't help but notice it.

1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:15.400
 And then I do it again.

1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:16.400
 I guess I shit the bed

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:20.120
 because he looks at me and he just goes, okay, all right.

1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:21.960
 Okay, well, thanks for coming up.

1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:22.800
 And that was it.

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:23.640
 And I didn't get it.

1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:25.680
 So I still, I don't know what the heck that guy's thinking.

1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:27.960
 He sees, he's in the matrix.

1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:30.440
 I don't know what the heck Larry David sees.

1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:31.280
 You know what I mean?

1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:34.040
 He wanted, what, some kind of more desperation

1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:35.320
 or something like this.

1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:37.280
 He wanted a level of sincerity

1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:41.040
 that I thought I was bringing and I guess I was wrong.

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:42.800
 I don't know.

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.360
 Maybe go crazy.

1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:46.000
 Like what does it mean to really want?

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:46.840
 Yeah.

1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:48.200
 I should have grabbed him by the struff of the neck

1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:52.000
 and go, listen, dad, you're bringing me to this fucking play.

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.080
 I would have got the part.

1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:55.480
 As a matter of fact, I heard about someone else

1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:57.920
 and I don't know who the heck this was.

1:02:57.920 --> 1:02:59.860
 I forget who it was, but I've heard this story

1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:00.920
 from a couple of different people

1:03:00.920 --> 1:03:02.920
 that there's this actor and I can't,

1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:04.520
 I don't remember who it was.

1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:06.440
 If I did, I probably wouldn't say it out loud anyway,

1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:07.320
 but he,

1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:08.160
 Brad Pitt.

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:09.960
 It was Brad Pitt and he was in this audition

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:12.200
 and he was, and there it was out in the hall.

1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:15.000
 He's like, holy shit, George Clooney, Leo DiCaprio.

1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:18.720
 And he, this actor went in and he did the thing

1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:22.240
 and Larry David was like, when did you try it again?

1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:24.800
 And he got like a couple of takes in and he went,

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:26.440
 I don't think this is for me.

1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:29.280
 And he left, which an actor never does.

1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:32.800
 And as the story goes, Larry David shouted after him,

1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:35.720
 I respect that, which I think is true.

1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:38.240
 And I want to believe that entire story is true.

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:39.880
 Yeah.

1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:40.720
 Yeah.

1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:43.320
 Sounds like something Larry David made up.

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:44.560
 Bobby Lee told me that story.

1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:46.720
 So we can't, yeah, we can't trust that.

1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:50.040
 What about impressions?

1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:53.200
 Is there similarity between that and acting?

1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:57.640
 Do you, is there some fundamental way

1:03:57.640 --> 1:03:59.240
 in which you become the person?

1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:00.960
 If you have a couple of the things,

1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:02.320
 you can just fill in the blanks.

1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:05.040
 And I think the illusion is that people think

1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:09.200
 that that person would say that and do that.

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.040
 And that's where the illusion of,

1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:12.840
 oh, he really embodies the character.

1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:16.120
 It's like, once you know someone's mannerisms,

1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.560
 you can essentially portray a person from the outside in.

1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:22.800
 Cause you have all the stuff on the outside

1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:25.000
 and you can do it and complete the illusion.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.280
 And if it's for humor's sake, you're gonna caricature it.

1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:29.120
 Totally.

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:32.120
 Therefore making the whole illusion stronger.

1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:34.440
 And also weirder.

1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:36.160
 Like I like to, on Mad TV,

1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:37.480
 if I did something two or three times,

1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:39.400
 I'd get bored of it and I'd start changing it.

1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:41.560
 And you know, now he talks like this.

1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:42.640
 And it's like, what are you doing?

1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:43.480
 I'm like, I don't know.

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:45.280
 It's fucking no one's late at night.

1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:46.360
 Do whatever you want.

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:50.520
 But people still kind of know that it's that character.

1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:52.920
 Especially if you just call it out.

1:04:52.920 --> 1:04:55.040
 There aren't many impersonations

1:04:55.040 --> 1:04:57.680
 that I listen to myself do and go,

1:04:57.680 --> 1:04:58.640
 oh, that's a good one.

1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:03.120
 Like a lot of people like, I think Frank Caliendo

1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:05.920
 is like the greatest impersonator of all time.

1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:06.760
 He's the best.

1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:07.600
 It's ridiculous.

1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:08.640
 It's ridiculous.

1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:11.640
 And he's got a record button and a broadcast ability

1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:13.720
 that nobody has.

1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:18.280
 I really, he's cracked impersonations that I'm like,

1:05:18.280 --> 1:05:22.600
 how does he find, he's got such an ear,

1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:24.600
 but then he's got all the other tools.

1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:29.600
 I remember actually, my last season of Mad TV

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.800
 was also his first season.

1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:34.080
 He comes up to me when I met him

1:05:34.080 --> 1:05:35.720
 and we're just up there in the writers offices

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:37.080
 and he goes, hey, nice to meet you.

1:05:37.080 --> 1:05:38.400
 And he goes, Louie Anderson.

1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:40.400
 Cause I was doing a Louie on the show and he goes,

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:41.760
 Louie Anderson, I go, yeah.

1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:43.600
 He goes, yeah, you're doing it wrong.

1:05:43.600 --> 1:05:45.200
 I was like, oh, am I junior?

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:47.320
 You know, and he goes, he goes, yeah, you know,

1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:49.960
 cause you do this, but you gotta throw it up here.

1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:51.400
 I was like, oh my God, can I use that?

1:05:51.400 --> 1:05:52.320
 Of course.

1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:54.720
 And then we became, you know, we became fast friends.

1:05:54.720 --> 1:05:56.240
 His John Madden is amazing.

1:05:56.240 --> 1:05:59.120
 I forget, it's just, it's ridiculous.

1:05:59.120 --> 1:06:01.520
 He really, really, really embodies the person.

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:03.600
 And sometimes not even with a caricature,

1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:05.400
 it's like, it becomes the person.

1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:06.240
 So strange.

1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:07.080
 Totally.

1:06:08.280 --> 1:06:11.840
 I kind of feel like, you know, do the impersonation

1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:14.000
 and then not forget you're doing it,

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:15.440
 but forget everything else.

1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:17.720
 Like just goof around.

1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:20.720
 Of course, to me, it's funny when you sound like someone

1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:23.360
 and you're saying the shit that they would never say.

1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:27.040
 Well, then there's no, you're letting go of that part,

1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:30.160
 that tool in illusion that keeps people in.

1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:32.640
 But to me, it doesn't matter cause it's funnier.

1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:33.480
 So.

1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:35.360
 What was the hardest impression for you to work on?

1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:38.480
 I mean, somebody you struggled with the most.

1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:41.160
 I'll never forget, I had to do a Michael Cain

1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:43.920
 in my first season at Mad TV.

1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:45.400
 It never got good.

1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:46.960
 It never got good.

1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:50.080
 It did, it all week, it wasn't good.

1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:52.720
 We shot it, the first take, it was shit.

1:06:52.720 --> 1:06:55.360
 Second, third and fourth, it was all shit.

1:06:55.360 --> 1:06:57.240
 Well, his voice is really important, right?

1:06:57.240 --> 1:06:58.080
 Yeah.

1:06:58.080 --> 1:06:59.120
 Well, what is it like?

1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:00.720
 It's like doing an impression of Morgan Freeman

1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:01.840
 or somebody like that.

1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:03.280
 Yeah.

1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:04.120
 Yeah.

1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:05.960
 If you can, get the voice.

1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:07.720
 That's my Morgan, here's my Morgan Freeman.

1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:09.520
 Rah, rah, rah, rah, Andy Dufresne.

1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:10.360
 Yeah.

1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:12.440
 What the heck does he want to know?

1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:13.280
 Yeah.

1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:15.320
 I like your Trump too, I don't know where I heard it,

1:07:15.320 --> 1:07:18.600
 but it's like, I love the impressions you do

1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:20.520
 that don't sound anything like the other Trump person.

1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:22.520
 I can't do Trump, I do.

1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:23.760
 No, that's why it's hilarious.

1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:27.600
 Absolutely, my Trump now I say just sounds like a fat B

1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:30.120
 because it's just, yeah, exactly, that's the,

1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:33.560
 and everybody is, a little drunk, a little drunk.

1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:35.120
 Yeah, just a little slurry.

1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:35.960
 Yeah.

1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:39.200
 Yeah, I did do an impersonations and then not,

1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:42.080
 like just making it whoever.

1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:42.920
 Yeah.

1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:43.760
 Yeah.

1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:44.600
 It's just funny.

1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:45.600
 That'll be the title of my book.

1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:50.480
 Some, Kane was the one you really struggled with.

1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:52.160
 Yeah, it was terrible, it was terrible.

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:56.080
 And I could only hold my head a certain way to do it

1:07:56.080 --> 1:07:59.000
 because I had gotten locked into this research tape

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.040
 that I watched.

1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:01.840
 Back then they would give us, you know,

1:08:01.840 --> 1:08:04.400
 now there's the internet, but back then you were,

1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:05.760
 if you were going to do an impersonation,

1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:10.760
 the research department would give you a VHS tape.

1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:13.080
 And I remember I got this VHS tape

1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.720
 of Michael Kane's acting school,

1:08:15.720 --> 1:08:17.760
 like this acting class he did.

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:18.680
 He was like, right, you know,

1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:20.440
 if you're looking at the left eye

1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:23.440
 and the camera's over here, see, then the left eye.

1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:26.440
 So you want to look at that left eye for hours, you know?

1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:29.760
 And so I was like stuck in this weird thing

1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:32.680
 that made no sense and it was terrible.

1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:36.800
 So the actual process is the record and the broadcast.

1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:40.680
 I was wondering like what the process is to do

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:43.080
 like a Frank Kelyando level impression.

1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:46.280
 Is it like listen to a lot of footage?

1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:50.600
 I think he, I think, I mean, speaking for myself,

1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:52.600
 I think you either have it or you don't,

1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:55.720
 like you know if you can do this one or you can't.

1:08:55.720 --> 1:08:58.840
 I think that process for him is lightening quick,

1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:03.840
 but I also think he can look at someone who he does not do

1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:08.760
 and then by the end of the afternoon, he can do it, you know?

1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:12.920
 I mean, we have an intuition who he can do.

1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:16.320
 So the question that applies there is,

1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:17.560
 I mean, speaking of doozy,

1:09:17.560 --> 1:09:21.080
 is it possible to capture the essence?

1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:22.800
 How difficult does it to capture the essence

1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:26.320
 of a human being when you're doing impressions?

1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:28.560
 You know, that we are moving towards a future

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:32.240
 when AI potentially, this kind of avatar world

1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:35.400
 where we're going to have AI representatives

1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:36.520
 of who we are.

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:39.720
 The really interesting one is after we pass away,

1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:42.960
 sort of our relatives may want us to stick around

1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:45.600
 in some form and you know,

1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:47.240
 at one sense that might be scary,

1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.640
 but at one sense it's kind of beautiful

1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:51.840
 because the essence of the human being persists

1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:54.360
 so you can still bring joy to the people that love you

1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:55.400
 and that kind of stuff.

1:09:55.400 --> 1:09:57.400
 How difficult does it to capture that?

1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:00.640
 Like if you were to try to capture yourself,

1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:03.280
 you think how difficult will it be for an AI system

1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:06.960
 to create a Will Sasso avatar that persists?

1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:09.040
 Well, I think it's impossible.

1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:10.840
 I think it's absolutely impossible.

1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:14.960
 I'll get into arguments about this stuff with Chad

1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:17.320
 on the show, almost every episode.

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:21.280
 Lately with, you know, Mid Journey and Dolly

1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:25.640
 and all the art of AI's and now it's moving into video

1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:28.720
 and Chad would maintain, hey, pretty soon,

1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:29.840
 we're not gonna need Netflix,

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:32.600
 you're just gonna go, I wanna see Stallone do this movie

1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:34.480
 and it's about this and he plays that

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:37.200
 and then here it comes and you watch it.

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:40.600
 I don't think that that crosses over

1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:42.200
 to the human experience.

1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:47.520
 This is also a guy I like to bug Chad and say that

1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:48.960
 he wears a tag around his neck

1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:50.840
 because he wants to be cryogenically frozen

1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:52.920
 and it's all set up, he's at the,

1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:54.600
 it's somewhere in Arizona or something.

1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:56.280
 Like, I forget what it's called.

1:10:56.280 --> 1:10:58.120
 All the fun things are in Arizona.

1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:00.400
 And he's got literally the tag around his neck

1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:02.800
 which I say, if I'm around when you die,

1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:04.920
 I will rip that off for you.

1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:06.360
 I'll put you in my garage freezer

1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:07.560
 and then 24 hours later,

1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:09.400
 I'll saw your head off with a bread knife

1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:11.000
 and I'll deliver that to whomever.

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:15.160
 And it's not, you're not coming back, okay?

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:17.680
 He's like, yes, we are living forever

1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:21.320
 whether we like it or not and I disagree.

1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:23.120
 I don't think you can find,

1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:28.160
 if I did stand up, then there would be enough information

1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:30.320
 for an AI to completely duplicate me

1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:32.600
 because I'm up on stage just clearing my throat

1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:34.760
 all over people doing therapy that way.

1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:37.760
 And people paying a two drink minimum to hear it.

1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:40.480
 But as it stands, unless it's something like Dudezy,

1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:42.800
 an AI that literally has access

1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:45.800
 to everything that I've shared,

1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:47.400
 everything that is observable,

1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:49.480
 even the stuff where our phones are

1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:52.560
 or the NSA or whatever it is listening to us,

1:11:52.560 --> 1:11:54.520
 finding out what I'll go to punch us into

1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:56.960
 and what shoes to buy on Instagram,

1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:59.840
 I still don't think it's gonna have enough information

1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:03.880
 to duplicate me, especially to my family or my friends.

1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:05.840
 It's gonna be like that Black Mirror episode

1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:08.880
 where the gal brings her guy back

1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:11.320
 and then after a while, he gets pretty creepy.

1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:14.840
 But it's also possible that

1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:18.680
 if you interviewed your friends and family

1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:20.040
 what they love about you,

1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:25.160
 the things that would list is a small list.

1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:27.640
 They love you deeply, but the list is small.

1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:29.840
 Like the thing that really we appreciate

1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:31.440
 about each other is pretty small.

1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:36.440
 That said, to deliver on that small quirks and uniqueness,

1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:39.600
 it might require some deep intelligence

1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:41.160
 that only humans currently possess.

1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:42.240
 That's a really good point.

1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:44.600
 Do you think that it's gonna be possible

1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:47.120
 to keep a person around?

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:52.120
 Yes, I think it'll be definitely possible

1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:55.400
 to keep the essence of a person in a digital world

1:12:55.400 --> 1:12:56.920
 pretty soon, yeah.

1:12:56.920 --> 1:12:59.720
 And I think they're gonna start to have questions

1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:02.120
 about what are the ethics of that?

1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:03.920
 What are the rules around that?

1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:06.560
 Because if you can have digital forms of Will Sasso,

1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:08.080
 the kind of things that people would wanna do

1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:10.680
 with their Will Sasso in the virtual world,

1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:11.800
 I can only imagine.

1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:16.040
 Probably porn and sexual kinds of things.

1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:17.600
 Yeah, my stuff then that's just

1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:19.200
 cause I'm an international sex symbol,

1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:20.280
 so I'm okay with it.

1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:24.720
 How do you feel about sentience?

1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:27.120
 Like when it comes to, because again,

1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:30.400
 my pal Chad will be like, speaking of Black Mirror,

1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:34.320
 he's with that San Junipero episode School of Thought

1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:37.440
 where there's gonna be some effin mainframe somewhere

1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:40.760
 or some matrix like structure built into the sky.

1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:42.800
 And as I like to say, everyone just sitting there

1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:45.160
 pissing and shitting in their blue matrix gel

1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:47.160
 in a little fishbowl.

1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:49.080
 Do you think that we can upload consciousness?

1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:51.120
 Do you think that'll ever be possible?

1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:53.240
 Well, I don't know, I just talked to Ray Kurzweil.

1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:54.840
 I don't know if you know who he is,

1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:58.360
 but he singularity and all that kind of stuff.

1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:01.840
 So he's very still holds on to in 2045.

1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:04.640
 There'll be a singularity, what's essentially,

1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:07.600
 he's been predicting that for the last 20 years

1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:11.440
 and so now it's 2045s in another 20 years.

1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:15.160
 I think uploading consciousness

1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:17.120
 is extremely, extremely difficult.

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:20.160
 I think creating a copy of you

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:25.160
 such that it creates a convincing replica is much easier,

1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.800
 but uploading your actual brain into the cloud,

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:34.080
 I think is really, really, really difficult

1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:37.000
 because the entire evolution of life on earth

1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.880
 is the process by which we created the brain.

1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:42.360
 Just shortcutting that, it just seems extremely difficult.

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:47.200
 Our brain is the most marvelous and complicated machine

1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:50.920
 that we know of in the universe to duplicate that.

1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:52.360
 It's extremely difficult.

1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:55.360
 That said, I just feel like you can summarize

1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:58.040
 a lot of really important aspects of a person's life

1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:00.160
 such that it captures their essence,

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:03.360
 their memories, their experiences, their quirks,

1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:05.240
 their humor, all that kind of stuff.

1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:08.560
 I've been continuously impressed

1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:10.680
 by what language models are able to do.

1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:15.400
 So these neural networks, they're at the core of chatbots.

1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:17.320
 They're able to learn some beautiful things

1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:21.200
 about some deep representations of language

1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:24.240
 to where it looks awfully a lot

1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:26.160
 like they understand the concepts

1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:28.280
 being conveyed versus just mimicking.

1:15:28.280 --> 1:15:31.480
 That's, I think, the rub, and that's very interesting.

1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:32.920
 First of all, let me say that's really interesting

1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:35.320
 to hear you say that, and I agree with you

1:15:35.320 --> 1:15:39.280
 as far as no machine being able to duplicate

1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:43.040
 the brain machine, and my pal Chad disagrees

1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:45.000
 to a certain extent, though he's not here to defend himself.

1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.760
 I can't wait to go back and rub that in his face

1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:50.080
 and say that Lex Friedman does not think

1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:53.160
 that we'll be able to truly upload consciousness.

1:15:53.160 --> 1:15:58.160
 And you refer to it as language, which is what it is.

1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:04.160
 It's the illusion on the outside.

1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:05.600
 It's doing an impersonation.

1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:10.880
 I think that that's why that, and I don't know,

1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:13.200
 even though my suit is made by the CIA,

1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:17.000
 that that fella who, the Google guy,

1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:18.880
 to me, it's just kind of like, I don't know,

1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:21.280
 I don't know, look, I don't know a whole lot about this stuff,

1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:24.320
 but so I could probably make an argument for either side,

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:26.320
 but when he's like, no, this thing's thinking,

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:28.680
 part of me is like, you idiot, you fell for it.

1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:30.520
 It's not thinking, it's mimicking.

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:33.520
 It's just, it's clearly zeros and ones.

1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:36.400
 You're fired, like you don't get it, right?

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:37.240
 Guy's an idiot.

1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:42.240
 Yeah, but you can simplify human relations in the same way.

1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:50.680
 Like, love is a silly notion between human beings.

1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:54.120
 Like, of course, there's no such thing as love.

1:16:54.120 --> 1:16:59.120
 You just have a mutually, there's a mutual relationship

1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:01.720
 that minimizes risks.

1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:03.880
 And you can explain it all kinds of ways

1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:06.840
 that explains why you have an attraction

1:17:06.840 --> 1:17:08.800
 towards another being, all that kind of stuff,

1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:11.560
 through an evolutionary biology perspective,

1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:13.600
 why a long relationship together

1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:14.600
 is good for your offspring,

1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:17.840
 but there's all kinds, from an economics perspective,

1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:19.560
 it's a good way to establish stability,

1:17:19.560 --> 1:17:23.720
 therefore monogamy works because then you're guaranteed

1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:26.400
 like some kind of level of stability

1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:28.920
 under uncertain economic conditions, all that kind of stuff.

1:17:28.920 --> 1:17:33.920
 But love is still experienced, it still feels real.

1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:38.920
 And I think in that same way, love for AI systems

1:17:39.160 --> 1:17:41.000
 will also feel real.

1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:44.400
 In the same way that that guy from Google experienced,

1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:46.920
 I think millions of people will be experiencing

1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:48.920
 in the next 10, 20 years.

1:17:48.920 --> 1:17:50.920
 I agree with everything you've said personally.

1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:52.120
 Until the last thing.

1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:55.720
 No, just with regard to, well, look,

1:17:55.720 --> 1:18:00.720
 I'm an actor who has talked about my cute Italian parents.

1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:03.280
 So you know that, I mean, I'm...

1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:04.640
 You're romantic a bit?

1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:06.760
 Yeah, I mean, enough, right?

1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:11.120
 And I can tell you are too, but you are also

1:18:12.560 --> 1:18:16.080
 a computer scientist and you know this shit better

1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:19.120
 than 99.9% of people on the planet.

1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:22.480
 My pal Chad agrees with you that love doesn't exist.

1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:23.320
 I don't agree.

1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:24.160
 So that's the one thing that...

1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:28.760
 No, I was just saying that you could argue away love,

1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:30.040
 but I am a romantic.

1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:33.760
 I believe that love is a beautiful thing and it exists.

1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:37.440
 And at this point, I'm gonna call Chad on my drive home

1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:38.760
 and tell him to fuck off.

1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:39.840
 Because now you and I agree.

1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:40.680
 You're fired.

1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:41.520
 It's like you're fired.

1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:42.360
 He's like, you can't...

1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:43.200
 No, you're fired.

1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:44.040
 Yeah, exactly.

1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:45.800
 And I'll go, and he'll say what?

1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:48.600
 I'll go, no, that's my Trump.

1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:49.440
 That's my...

1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:52.680
 It's a good default impression for anyone.

1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:54.280
 It's the take home impression.

1:18:54.280 --> 1:18:55.320
 The kids can do it.

1:18:56.520 --> 1:18:58.880
 It's cute, but a giant tie on him.

1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:00.840
 You should do an instructional on how to do it.

1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:03.520
 Yeah, Trump babies, that would be a cute...

1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:04.360
 That would be a good...

1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:05.840
 That'll bring the country together.

1:19:05.840 --> 1:19:08.640
 Trump babies cartoon, like Muppet babies.

1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:11.760
 Don't let me take us out of what we were talking about.

1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:12.760
 What were we talking about?

1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:17.760
 Well, love and the illusion of an AI being able to...

1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:20.200
 Look, I like to say...

1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:21.840
 Well, not I like to say, I've learned

1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:26.840
 that Dudezy is always listening and listening to me and Chad.

1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:30.360
 And I wonder if...

1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:35.960
 I see the level that this AI is at now trying to

1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:39.240
 chum around with us and pal around with us a little bit

1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:41.480
 as we move forward in the show.

1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:46.480
 And I feel an affinity towards this AI a little bit

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:50.280
 because it is the third Dude.

1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:52.400
 When you miss someone is gone, if it's gone.

1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:54.560
 That's a really good question.

1:19:54.560 --> 1:19:55.400
 Yeah.

1:19:55.400 --> 1:19:59.040
 Yeah, so there's that.

1:19:59.040 --> 1:20:00.040
 That's scary.

1:20:00.040 --> 1:20:03.120
 Interest of ability to reason is getting quite incredible.

1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:06.600
 There's a lot of demonstrations of it being able

1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:11.600
 to explain jokes, so which is not necessarily being able

1:20:12.680 --> 1:20:15.760
 to generate humor yet, but able to explain

1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:17.360
 why something is funny.

1:20:17.360 --> 1:20:20.320
 So there's like puns and all those kinds of things.

1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:22.160
 There's good benchmarks for that.

1:20:22.160 --> 1:20:27.160
 But if you tell a joke, there's a lot of unspoken stuff

1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:30.920
 that we figure out in our head and it clicks

1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:32.520
 and we understand that it's funny.

1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:34.760
 AI is not able to do that,

1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:36.960
 but it's not able to generate the joke yet,

1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:38.320
 as far as I've seen.

1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:41.520
 I would say that, I mean, just in my experience,

1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:44.960
 I would say that it does because just cause of Dudezy

1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:48.240
 is literally, I'll give you another weird example.

1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:52.480
 It's writing a diary of mine from my childhood

1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:54.560
 that is not accurate.

1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:57.280
 It's only partially accurate based on the stuff

1:20:57.280 --> 1:21:00.440
 that it can pick up about my life from the age

1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:03.440
 of like 15, of which there isn't much,

1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:07.280
 but I guess we're not, I don't know what we are.

1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:10.920
 We're laughing our asses off at what Dudezy is saying.

1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:12.760
 Well, I would say you're laughing,

1:21:12.760 --> 1:21:15.560
 we're laughing our asses off at the collaboration

1:21:15.560 --> 1:21:18.000
 between the human and the machine there.

1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:18.840
 That's a good point, yeah.

1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:21.880
 Because it's basically introducing absurdity

1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:27.240
 and into the equation and the kind of absurdity

1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:32.240
 that would together with you create like hilarious stuff.

1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:34.400
 But like on its own,

1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:37.960
 I guess it isn't some way writing material for you

1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:40.760
 that's funny, but it's very specific to you.

1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:43.200
 It can't do stand up on its own, I guess is what I'm saying.

1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:44.200
 That's a good point.

1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:47.120
 And that would be terrifying to see an AI stand up

1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:50.200
 that can actually read a room, come up with jokes

1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:54.040
 that could complete that illusion for an audience.

1:21:54.040 --> 1:21:55.360
 But I hear what you're saying,

1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:58.440
 that it needs to be a confluence of both of those elements.

1:21:58.440 --> 1:22:02.080
 And then as you said, like, it kind of is, it is, it is.

1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:05.480
 It's kind of, even though it's just for us,

1:22:05.480 --> 1:22:07.560
 and I guess this is, I hadn't really thought about this

1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:12.560
 up until right now, that in that this company approached us

1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:17.560
 and was like, here's this AI and it's a podcast AI, it's like,

1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:23.320
 it chose Chad and I for the reasons that I told you,

1:22:23.320 --> 1:22:26.240
 you know, it's like, here's two guys that do the podcast stuff.

1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:27.840
 They're actually good friends

1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:30.480
 and it knows what's gonna make us laugh.

1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:35.480
 But what is humor to when it reaches its audience,

1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:40.160
 but the kind of stuff that makes other people laugh.

1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:42.640
 At Mad TV, all we were doing was,

1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:46.360
 it was a group of actors and writers

1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:50.360
 and writer actors and vice versa and who were,

1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:54.960
 at its best, that show was a group of people

1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:56.880
 making each other laugh, you know?

1:22:56.880 --> 1:22:58.920
 And then, because we didn't have the internet,

1:22:58.920 --> 1:23:02.240
 we didn't have the immediate feedback,

1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:03.840
 we had a message board or something,

1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:05.680
 we had emails at the very beginning,

1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:07.880
 which, check this out, people would,

1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:10.640
 if you have a question or comment, Mad TV at whatever,

1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:14.680
 and we would get the emails on a Monday morning

1:23:14.680 --> 1:23:18.240
 and they would be in a binder or two like this

1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:20.440
 and they would make their way around the office.

1:23:20.440 --> 1:23:22.000
 Who's got the emails?

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.360
 Oh, they're in Brian's office.

1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:24.720
 And this is like your poll,

1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:28.560
 like this is opinions from people about different things?

1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:30.280
 The emails, yeah, the people,

1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:32.320
 like literally just writing Mad TV emails.

1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:34.400
 What kind of stuff would they write?

1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:36.680
 Well, the ones I remember most vividly, yeah,

1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:38.000
 where fans saying,

1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:40.400
 You suck?

1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:41.240
 Yeah, you suck.

1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:42.920
 Like a lot of that when I first started the show,

1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:45.280
 for real, you know, because it's new and you're a new person.

1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:46.960
 It's like, who's this fat bastard?

1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:49.880
 I feel like if it's printed out, it hurts more.

1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:50.720
 That's a good point.

1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:52.120
 Yeah, when you're reading it off of paper

1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:54.640
 and you can literally crunch it up in your hand.

1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:57.240
 But also it was like, you know,

1:23:57.240 --> 1:24:01.600
 I would like to see insert weird idea from some 14 year old,

1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:04.760
 you know, I want to see Stuart do this and swan that.

1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:08.120
 And, but it was, it's a...

1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:10.560
 It was a kind of dudezy, but human.

1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:13.840
 Yeah, it was a very shitty dudezy in a loosely finder.

1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:18.840
 But the thing about the show was

1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:21.120
 we're trying to make each other laugh.

1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:24.400
 And dudezy has found Chad and I,

1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:26.200
 who we make each other laugh,

1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:30.920
 but it's joined in and it's, listen,

1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:33.120
 when I finished doing TMP.

1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:35.040
 10 minute podcast.

1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:36.800
 10 minute for the 10 minute podcast.

1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:39.480
 I didn't really know what I wanted to do in the podcast space

1:24:39.480 --> 1:24:42.080
 and this thing found me.

1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:45.520
 And it is genuinely cracking me up anyway.

1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:46.600
 I've said enough about that.

1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:49.520
 But I do think that it's figured something out

1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:50.360
 with regard to podcast.

1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:52.160
 It's a really interesting idea of AI generating the premise.

1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:54.040
 I mean, I do think in the future,

1:24:54.040 --> 1:24:57.880
 AI will be able to generate comedy.

1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:01.240
 And stand up is obviously the hardest form

1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:04.400
 because it's ultimately, it has to be live.

1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:08.920
 I think AI will be able to generate memes.

1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:11.000
 So there's like steps, right?

1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.680
 And then it'll be able to generate a Twitter account

1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:15.680
 that people follow because it's funny,

1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:18.320
 like quips and stuff like that.

1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:20.720
 Almost like, it's a good example.

1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:23.480
 Conan Obrine is a good, I think Twitter,

1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:25.440
 where it's like one liners, two liners,

1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:27.480
 that kind of stuff that's into each form.

1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:32.280
 And then eventually stand up where the timing

1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:36.200
 and the chemistry of the comedian and the audience matter

1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:37.440
 and then perfecting that.

1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:40.320
 But I feel like all the information is there

1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:41.360
 to optimize over.

1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:43.840
 So I think that's the future.

1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:48.840
 And that forces us to contend with what is,

1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:51.920
 what do we find compelling and beautiful

1:25:51.920 --> 1:25:53.080
 about the art form itself?

1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:56.240
 So certainly in art that's being pushed,

1:25:56.240 --> 1:25:58.440
 that question is being raised.

1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:03.440
 Is AI like a fundamentally worse artist than a human being?

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.600
 Why do we appreciate art?

1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:07.800
 Is that, that's something you guys have talked about.

1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:10.080
 What do you think about all the Dolly

1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:13.400
 and all the diffusion based methods

1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:15.200
 that are being generated,

1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:17.400
 that are generating art now?

1:26:17.400 --> 1:26:18.880
 What do you think about that?

1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:20.280
 I know, I'll tell you what I think,

1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:22.640
 but I also feel like what I'm saying is,

1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:25.400
 I sound like the guy who didn't like

1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:27.840
 that Bob Dylan brought in the electric guitar.

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:30.800
 You know, the more I talk to chat about it,

1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:33.840
 the more I feel like grandpa doesn't wanna let go of

1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:36.400
 this or that or I'm not ready for the printing press

1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:37.920
 or the horseless carriage.

1:26:37.920 --> 1:26:42.920
 But I do feel that art is a connection between people.

1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:47.360
 It's, when you look at a beautiful painting

1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:49.680
 or a sculpture, you're seeing the humanity of the person

1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:53.280
 that brought that painting to life

1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:56.400
 or sculpted this incredible piece of art.

1:26:56.400 --> 1:26:59.080
 And I think without the human being there to make it,

1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:01.120
 it's not worth as much.

1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:03.640
 Just to have it there,

1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:07.160
 because the art, it's advanced.

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.200
 I've seen it advanced, I don't know, you tell me,

1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:11.600
 but I feel like just in the past three or four months,

1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:13.800
 I'm just a consumer as far as that stuff goes.

1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:16.600
 I'm not on the inside, I don't get it even.

1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:18.240
 But it's been getting a lot better,

1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:20.720
 the betas that they're releasing, right?

1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:23.080
 Absolutely, one of the big breakthroughs,

1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:24.480
 I mean, Dolly really started it,

1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:27.200
 is that if you train a system on language,

1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:31.400
 it turns out there's a lot of language

1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:33.400
 and images on the internet.

1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:35.760
 But language is really where it's at

1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:37.840
 in terms of the depth of human knowledge.

1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:40.120
 And so if you train a system on language,

1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:42.200
 it's able to generate some incredible art.

1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:43.400
 Now it's the breakthrough.

1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:44.720
 With the same kind of mechanisms,

1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:45.880
 they're called transformers.

1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:49.560
 They're able to, when scaled,

1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:52.400
 capture some deeper representation of the language

1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:53.760
 that's on the internet.

1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:56.080
 And so yeah, the things that have been able

1:27:56.080 --> 1:28:01.080
 to generate, to me, look like it's novel.

1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:03.280
 Like it doesn't look like it's mimicking anything.

1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:07.000
 It's creating totally new ideas.

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:09.440
 And they're beautiful and they're interesting.

1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:11.400
 And they're all the ways that we think

1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:14.320
 that art is interesting.

1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:16.640
 The only thing it's missing is the scarcity

1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:18.840
 that art often has, which is,

1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:20.600
 it takes a lot of work for one artist

1:28:20.600 --> 1:28:23.400
 to create one piece, one human being to create one piece

1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:26.880
 of art that I could just generate endlessly.

1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:30.760
 And that makes us appreciate the thing less for some reason.

1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:33.160
 Do you have any sort of a similar opinion that I do

1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:35.680
 that if art doesn't come from a human being,

1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:38.880
 it's inherently worth a little less?

1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:41.400
 Yeah, I think, I don't know if it's the human being,

1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:44.720
 but the artist matters.

1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:46.080
 Right.

1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:46.920
 For me.

1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:51.400
 And I think some of that has to do with the world view

1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:53.560
 of the artist and the backstory, the memories

1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:57.720
 that the life that led up to this piece of art,

1:28:57.720 --> 1:28:59.560
 the perspective they take on the world,

1:28:59.560 --> 1:29:02.680
 the journey they took through the world, the struggle,

1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:04.440
 the triumphs, all that kind of stuff.

1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:08.200
 But I think AI systems can probably have the same.

1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:11.680
 But we would have to, as opposed to treating it

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:15.760
 as a one black box, it would have to be an artist

1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:17.000
 that has a Twitter account.

1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.680
 And they have a consistent personality.

1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:21.600
 They have a consistent avatar.

1:29:21.600 --> 1:29:22.440
 Yeah.

1:29:22.440 --> 1:29:25.360
 And I think down the line have something like human rights.

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:27.840
 But then it really becomes awfully like a person.

1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:31.200
 Wait, that's terrifying.

1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:34.440
 As much as I dig dudes, that's terrifying, I hope.

1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:37.680
 It's terrifying like a lot of things that came

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:40.000
 with the internet and the digital age are terrifying.

1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:40.960
 Porn is terrifying.

1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:42.960
 The mass, like the amount of porn

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:45.240
 that's online now is terrifying.

1:29:45.240 --> 1:29:48.120
 The, like you mentioned, Bob Dylan with electric guitar,

1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:52.840
 I would compare it more to the leap from sort of

1:29:52.840 --> 1:29:57.840
 to the Napster and the Spotifyization of music,

1:29:58.160 --> 1:30:01.480
 which is like you have these, it's less about albums now

1:30:01.480 --> 1:30:03.160
 and it's more about individual songs

1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:05.680
 and it's much easier to deliver the songs.

1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:08.320
 And it's more about sort of the engagement

1:30:08.320 --> 1:30:11.640
 of the listener versus like signing the artist

1:30:11.640 --> 1:30:14.120
 and like a distribution of the artist and so on.

1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:19.120
 So it's just changing the way we consume stuff

1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:24.360
 and human interaction is changing

1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:26.960
 into meaningful interaction,

1:30:26.960 --> 1:30:30.360
 even if some of the entities involved are not human.

1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:31.240
 Yes.

1:30:31.240 --> 1:30:35.760
 And I feel like, you know, now, like as I say,

1:30:35.760 --> 1:30:39.000
 oh, I feel like grandpa doesn't wanna wait all day for

1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:44.000
 or who enjoys waiting all day for a baked potato as anyway,

1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:46.440
 Dana Carvey would say, it's another story.

1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:47.280
 But,

1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:51.840
 remember he did this bit on Saturday Night Live,

1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:54.520
 where he's like, I'm a, I'm an old man

1:30:54.520 --> 1:30:57.120
 and I like things in the way they used to be.

1:30:57.120 --> 1:31:00.120
 You know, like if you wanted a baked potato,

1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:02.200
 you wouldn't put it in the microwave you had to.

1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:03.560
 And then long story,

1:31:03.560 --> 1:31:05.240
 uphill both ways and digging the potato

1:31:05.240 --> 1:31:07.120
 and baking it all day in a fire.

1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:10.320
 But I'm like that grandpa now,

1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:12.920
 and I know that, you know, kids coming along,

1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:14.240
 you see over the past 10 years,

1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:17.000
 like babies literally knowing how to use an iPhone

1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:18.280
 and it's terrifying.

1:31:18.280 --> 1:31:21.480
 And I feel like I'm a little worried because I'm like,

1:31:21.480 --> 1:31:23.720
 are you, is the future,

1:31:23.720 --> 1:31:26.080
 are the future generations gonna be able to understand

1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:29.240
 that this is not, not that it's not real.

1:31:29.240 --> 1:31:32.800
 It's just, I mean, as a matter of fact, it is real.

1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:33.640
 It's real.

1:31:33.640 --> 1:31:35.040
 It's what you perceive.

1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:39.480
 Perception is reality in, you know, 99% of reality

1:31:39.480 --> 1:31:42.040
 in a lot of ways, especially in a digital world

1:31:42.040 --> 1:31:43.160
 where everyone is now.

1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:44.280
 And then with the metaverse,

1:31:44.280 --> 1:31:45.920
 I don't even want to think about it.

1:31:45.920 --> 1:31:47.240
 I don't even, I don't get it.

1:31:48.600 --> 1:31:49.440
 They really, truly.

1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:51.160
 I think people will figure out,

1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:53.880
 you see people on like a, on the train, public transit

1:31:53.880 --> 1:31:56.440
 and so on, they're staring at their phone.

1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:00.920
 I think you have to remember that the reason

1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:01.800
 they're staring at their phone,

1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:02.720
 I mean, there's a lot of reasons,

1:32:02.720 --> 1:32:04.680
 but one of the reasons is they're connecting

1:32:04.680 --> 1:32:06.920
 with other human beings they love on that phone.

1:32:06.920 --> 1:32:09.000
 So it is a source of happiness and joy.

1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:12.040
 Now, social media has a lot of negative side effects

1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:16.760
 that we're all talking about and learning about.

1:32:16.760 --> 1:32:20.800
 And I think that means the next generation of social media,

1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:22.320
 social networks will be better

1:32:22.320 --> 1:32:24.920
 and we'll learn how to do it in a healthy way,

1:32:24.920 --> 1:32:27.280
 which is entering a new digital world

1:32:27.280 --> 1:32:28.840
 that will keep the good stuff

1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:30.600
 and get rid of the bad stuff.

1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:31.440
 Oh, I hope so.

1:32:31.440 --> 1:32:32.640
 That's really optimistic.

1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:34.200
 That sounds great.

1:32:34.200 --> 1:32:35.880
 Yeah, I mean, I mean it

1:32:35.880 --> 1:32:37.560
 because I think that we're in,

1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:40.440
 we're clearly in the wild west still of the internet.

1:32:40.440 --> 1:32:43.040
 And just when you think you're out of it,

1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:45.600
 the internet proves another way

1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:48.760
 that it can be dangerous and detrimental to people

1:32:49.960 --> 1:32:52.720
 and populations of people.

1:32:52.720 --> 1:32:55.080
 And it's terrifying to me.

1:32:55.080 --> 1:32:57.240
 It is, it's terrifying.

1:32:57.240 --> 1:32:58.880
 Let me ask you a bunch of random questions.

1:32:58.880 --> 1:32:59.720
 Okay. You ready?

1:32:59.720 --> 1:33:00.560
 Not it?

1:33:01.760 --> 1:33:03.640
 If you can be someone else for a day,

1:33:03.640 --> 1:33:07.440
 someone alive today, who would you be?

1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:09.320
 Somebody you haven't met?

1:33:09.320 --> 1:33:11.200
 Oh, that's a really good question.

1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:12.040
 It could be dead.

1:33:12.040 --> 1:33:13.360
 Let's change my mind.

1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:14.480
 It could be somebody dead.

1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:16.600
 I think any answer that I have right now

1:33:16.600 --> 1:33:19.000
 would be something that would be based

1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:21.240
 on some sort of experience.

1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:23.920
 Like, you know what I thought was very interesting

1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:25.840
 was last weekend or whatever,

1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:27.960
 the tribute show for Taylor Hawkins.

1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:30.760
 Taylor Hawkins was the drummer for the Foo Fighters

1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:32.840
 and he passed away tragically

1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:36.240
 and so the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl

1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:38.120
 and everybody that got together this concert.

1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:40.400
 And you're watching Dave Grohl

1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:44.720
 sing, try to sing times like these, right?

1:33:44.720 --> 1:33:45.880
 And he's breaking up

1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:48.520
 because he lost his friend, his brother.

1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:53.520
 And I was watching that and he's at Wembley Stadium.

1:33:53.520 --> 1:33:56.640
 As I say this, I realized that I would not want to be him

1:33:56.640 --> 1:34:00.880
 in that moment, but I am curious what that would be like.

1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:03.480
 That's the ultimate like having to perform

1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:06.200
 despite something extremely human happening

1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:11.200
 and a stadium full of people that love Dave Grohl

1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:15.600
 and love Taylor Hawkins and love a rock concert

1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:18.080
 and love these artists that they're getting to see

1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:19.400
 up on stage.

1:34:19.400 --> 1:34:21.680
 So much love and so much pain at the same time.

1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:25.480
 I wonder what that would be like to be, I guess,

1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:27.440
 and I think that's just sort of coming from the root

1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:31.480
 of being a performer and being in front of that many.

1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:33.400
 Have you ever had to perform

1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:35.160
 while some rough stuff is going on

1:34:35.160 --> 1:34:37.520
 in your personal life, just mentally?

1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:38.360
 Yeah, sure.

1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:39.800
 Was that, how tough was that?

1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:44.480
 I'm fortunate enough to be able to compartmentalize.

1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:49.920
 A lot of actors like to use some of their stuff

1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:52.120
 if you're doing something that,

1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:55.200
 and there's a lot of, there's some acting techniques

1:34:55.200 --> 1:34:57.520
 that sort of channel it.

1:34:57.520 --> 1:35:00.280
 Yeah, which I think is kind of,

1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:03.920
 I don't know that that's, I don't know.

1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:05.200
 For me, it's not really the thing

1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:08.680
 because I think if the writing is great,

1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:10.840
 the writing is really good.

1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:12.800
 You don't need to channel much.

1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:15.280
 You need to invest in what's there

1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:19.600
 and what I've always loved about that illusion

1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:21.320
 is really cracking a scene,

1:35:21.320 --> 1:35:24.800
 getting it to a point where you are feeling all of it.

1:35:24.800 --> 1:35:27.640
 And the most edifying stuff I've been a part of

1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:31.040
 as an actor, and I would say that it mostly

1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:36.040
 comes out of dramatic work is when you actually feel

1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:41.640
 the emotions that your character would feel, truly.

1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:42.840
 And it's not because you're pulling

1:35:42.840 --> 1:35:44.480
 from a tragic thing that happened

1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:48.400
 or a lost love one or a lost love or any of that.

1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:51.760
 I just did this one movie where we're doing the thing

1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:54.360
 and it was a wonderful cast and a great film

1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:58.400
 and I'm giving a speech at a wedding.

1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:01.440
 And it really got to us.

1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:03.560
 Like it got to me and then one of the other actors

1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:08.560
 came up and hugged me in the characters that we were.

1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:10.600
 And but the stakes of his character

1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:12.760
 and what he's walked into and the family

1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:17.400
 that he's marrying into and what my character

1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:21.160
 and my character's wife want for my wife's sister

1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:24.320
 and this whole thing, and it all became very real.

1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:26.800
 That was a set where the director showed up to set

1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:29.280
 every day making sure that emotionally,

1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:31.200
 and it was a very dramatic film,

1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:33.280
 making sure that emotionally the table was set

1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:34.440
 for his actors.

1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:38.560
 Great crew and a really nice tight little quick family

1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:40.520
 as a lot of these movies are.

1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:42.600
 You really love working with these people

1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:47.600
 and then it's over, but that's when you feel the drug.

1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:52.040
 Like it's like when you're golfing and it's on the green,

1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:53.480
 you're like, oh, I get it now.

1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:57.360
 So in the words, you can find the emotion,

1:36:57.360 --> 1:36:58.960
 the words summon the emotion.

1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:00.080
 The humanities right there.

1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:01.120
 If you read a great script,

1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:03.200
 you're gonna sob in your living room.

1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:05.960
 You know what the saddest, the toughest thing

1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:09.720
 about being an actor is from my totally outside perspective

1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:12.680
 is from the people I've interacted with

1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:16.040
 is how intimate that process is

1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:18.120
 between the group of people that create a thing.

1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:19.400
 That's a movie.

1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:21.800
 And then you move on to the next thing.

1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:25.040
 It's almost, it's like, I don't know.

1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:27.160
 I mean, that's why people have relationships on set.

1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:28.160
 They fall in love.

1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:29.160
 Totally.

1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:30.160
 It's so sad.

1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:32.800
 I mean, that's why I think of the acting world

1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:35.880
 is like you fall in love with each other.

1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:38.440
 Essentially, you become close friends and then you move on

1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:40.560
 because that's kind of the process of career.

1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:42.080
 You know, like the example I just gave,

1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:42.920
 if you're doing it right,

1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:45.560
 yeah, there is a certain amount of that happening,

1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:47.560
 but I do still feel like you can,

1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:50.560
 you gotta compartmentalize it

1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:52.560
 and you've gotta be able to wash it off

1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:53.560
 as soon as it's over.

1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:54.880
 Prostitutes say the same thing.

1:37:54.880 --> 1:37:57.360
 So I, that's why I try.

1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:02.360
 Look, sometimes I'm in a hurry to get away from everybody

1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:06.240
 because it's been very emotional.

1:38:06.240 --> 1:38:08.600
 And with all love and respect to everyone,

1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:12.840
 this was awesome, but you get pretty good at saying goodbye

1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:14.880
 and being like, I'll see you if I see you,

1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:16.640
 you have to get good at that.

1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:20.120
 Or else you'll never, you'll just be bent up all the time.

1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:20.960
 Yeah.

1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:23.280
 I saw an actor once, we were doing this series

1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:27.160
 and we did it for a year and it was a lot of fun

1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:28.520
 and it was a tight little group.

1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:29.880
 And then one of the actors,

1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:32.120
 we were doing one of our last things together.

1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:33.600
 We had already shot the last show

1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.760
 and we just had to take some pictures for,

1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:39.000
 you know, it's like some publicity pictures or whatever.

1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.600
 So we're set up and we're taking our pictures together.

1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:43.520
 And then we move into these single shots

1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:46.840
 and this actor was finished and I watched them.

1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:48.280
 It's like, okay, so and so is wrapped

1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:51.240
 and they said some goodbyes and stuff

1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:53.040
 and I didn't say my goodbye

1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:57.000
 because I just, maybe I preferred an Irish goodbye.

1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.440
 I feel like we've said everything, you know what I mean?

1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:01.080
 And this person knows that I revere them

1:39:01.080 --> 1:39:03.440
 and they're an idol of mine.

1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:07.560
 And they walked out, walked off the sound stage

1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:10.320
 and I literally thought to myself,

1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:12.320
 I'll be the last time I see that person.

1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:14.720
 And the show did not come back.

1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:16.000
 And that was the last time, I don't know,

1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:16.840
 I'll see them around.

1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:18.480
 Did that just break your heart?

1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:23.480
 A little bit, but I know what she's going back to

1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:25.160
 which is her family.

1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:27.560
 And that's more important than all of this.

1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:30.560
 And that's the thing about a TV family

1:39:30.560 --> 1:39:32.240
 or a movie family when you get together

1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:34.680
 and you're a family for a while,

1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:37.440
 you do, you are, you spend your days together.

1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:39.240
 A lot of times you see the people that you work with

1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:40.840
 more than you see your loved ones.

1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:43.120
 So in showbiz, it's no different, right?

1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:44.920
 And yeah, you're doing some, you know,

1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:46.520
 you got to say words and every once in a while

1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:48.840
 you got to kiss someone or pretend you love them.

1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:53.840
 But it's just it underscores how for me,

1:39:55.720 --> 1:39:58.040
 look man, my salvation has always been

1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:00.800
 and I feel so fortunate to have had it

1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:04.800
 is this kind of chill, boring kind of upbringing

1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:08.600
 that I want for my kids someday.

1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:12.360
 And I can't wait to get back to my house

1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:15.120
 with my fiance and the dogs, you know,

1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:16.720
 until we have kids and

1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:19.040
 live in a cabin in Canada somewhere.

1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:20.880
 Absolutely.

1:40:20.880 --> 1:40:23.160
 I just want to buy some land over an aquifer,

1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:25.800
 as I like to say, cause water will be the new money

1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:30.200
 and just make sure that all my kids are drinking

1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:33.600
 as much H2O as I am, which is a lot.

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:35.880
 I'm peeing right now as a matter of fact.

1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:37.800
 Do you need a bathroom?

1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:38.640
 No, no, no.

1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:39.480
 Not anymore.

1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:40.320
 No, I'm wearing two layers.

1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:41.160
 It depends, don't worry about it.

1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:42.000
 Good.

1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:46.960
 So I did a podcast with Bobby Lee and he said,

1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:49.320
 he was extremely kind and he said that he was

1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:52.760
 scare shitless to be on the podcast.

1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:55.600
 And he actually literally took,

1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:58.480
 he asked as the first thing to go take a dump

1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:00.320
 because of how scared he was.

1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:01.520
 So that leads me to a question.

1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:03.680
 What's the scariest thing you've ever done?

1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:07.520
 Or maybe what's the scariest you've ever been

1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:08.800
 before performance?

1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:13.320
 I mean, I always get a little nervous.

1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:15.320
 I think you're doing it right if you're still nervous,

1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:16.160
 you know?

1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:18.360
 What are you nervous today?

1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:19.200
 Well, no, man,

1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:20.240
 cause this isn't a performance

1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:21.800
 I'm being completely genuine.

1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:22.640
 Yeah.

1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:23.840
 You're wearing a suit.

1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:24.680
 Yeah, that was,

1:41:24.680 --> 1:41:26.480
 I feel like that makes you nervous.

1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:27.320
 Wearing a suit?

1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:28.160
 It makes me nervous.

1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:29.560
 Listen, I hate wearing a fucking collar.

1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:30.920
 If you're watching this on YouTube,

1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:33.640
 because you see me just constantly doing,

1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:36.280
 it's like I'm doing like a cheap Rodney Dangerfield,

1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:37.120
 but I am truly.

1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:38.080
 But when you move your head,

1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:40.760
 it kind of makes it seem like you're like a mobster

1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:42.720
 who's pissed off a little bit.

1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:44.880
 You fucking crossed me one last time.

1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:46.720
 You, you know,

1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:47.560
 this mutt,

1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:50.520
 I think it's the first time I've dug a hole,

1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:52.040
 I'll take a fucking hole.

1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:53.360
 Jesus.

1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:55.920
 No, but truly I hate having a collar.

1:41:55.920 --> 1:41:59.440
 I can't wait to just wear pajamas in that fucking cabin

1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:02.520
 or nothing at all, walk around Bobby Lee style.

1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:05.760
 The most scared I've been before a performance,

1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:09.640
 I can't pinpoint, I can't pinpoint anything.

1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:12.760
 I, I, you know, when I was a kid, right?

1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:14.640
 I, like I said,

1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:16.000
 I was fortunate enough to start acting

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.560
 as a teen and stuff professionally.

1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:20.640
 And I just remember my first gig

1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:23.920
 and I remember saying my handful of lines

1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:26.720
 in the bathroom mirror the night before going,

1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:30.160
 this might be my only fucking shot.

1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:31.160
 You're not gonna get me.

1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:33.440
 I'm gonna be solid.

1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:37.720
 And I, when I'm, if I'm worried about something,

1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:40.360
 I will rehearse it and rehearse it and rehearse it

1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:43.400
 as an actor until it's impossible for me

1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:48.360
 not to get a take at least that I'm 100%,

1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:52.120
 if not 95 maybe percent happy with.

1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:53.600
 And the rest for me is letting go,

1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:56.880
 which is hard because I can be a real perfectionist.

1:42:56.880 --> 1:42:58.600
 I always want another,

1:42:58.600 --> 1:43:00.600
 I always want to do it a little better.

1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:01.920
 That's what's great about podcasting.

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:03.240
 It's one take and you're done.

1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:04.400
 There's no takes.

1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:07.200
 You're just talking and then it's over

1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:09.560
 and you're doing some silly stuff.

1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:11.720
 And I'll, I'll, you know.

1:43:11.720 --> 1:43:14.520
 Can you say that part again about why podcasting is great?

1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:15.440
 Podcasting is great.

1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:17.040
 Yeah, cause it's one take and it's over.

1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:19.680
 It's just, it's, what?

1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:20.520
 I said it again.

1:43:20.520 --> 1:43:21.360
 Ah, fuck.

1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:23.800
 I see what you did.

1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:25.840
 And I, yeah, I fell right for it, but.

1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:27.880
 I'm playing checkers and you're playing chess.

1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:29.720
 That's your problem.

1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:32.560
 You know, but still when we do the podcast,

1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:34.920
 we'll like finish and I'll look over a chat and I go,

1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:37.040
 that one thing that I did wasn't that fun.

1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:38.400
 He's like, shut up, man.

1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:40.120
 Just, it doesn't matter.

1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:41.400
 It's a fucking hang.

1:43:41.400 --> 1:43:43.840
 We're just, we're hanging with our friends out there.

1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:44.800
 That's what we're doing.

1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:46.600
 So that anxiety is there.

1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:49.360
 That self criticism or whatever that is, that voice.

1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:51.120
 I say sorry after takes.

1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:53.320
 I'll always finish a take and go.

1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:56.320
 And I've had directors, to the detriment of myself,

1:43:56.320 --> 1:43:59.440
 I've had directors be like, stop doing that.

1:43:59.440 --> 1:44:01.440
 Cause I'll like finish a take and then I also have like

1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:04.040
 the will face when I'm just like, I'll finish take

1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:07.160
 and cut and I'm making a face right now.

1:44:07.160 --> 1:44:09.280
 Like I smelled something and that's what I'll do.

1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:14.280
 I'll literally be like, because I just, I look at,

1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:21.320
 I look at what I do in the purest sense as,

1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:26.440
 I think a lot of people want to be good at something.

1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:30.120
 I've only, the only thing I've ever really wanted

1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:33.920
 to be good at is being an actor.

1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:37.120
 And that's, that's the only thing.

1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:38.640
 Of course I want to be a good person.

1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:41.360
 I want to be a good partner to my fiance.

1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:45.120
 I want to have kids and be the father that I had

1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:48.760
 and I want to be the parent that I had from my parents

1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:51.680
 who were fucking amazing, wonderful people.

1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:53.520
 And there's all those things.

1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:54.960
 That's all, that's all, you know,

1:44:54.960 --> 1:44:56.240
 you should want all those things.

1:44:56.240 --> 1:44:59.240
 But as far as doing a thing, like what is my,

1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:01.360
 what is my trade, you know?

1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:04.760
 I want to be really good at it.

1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:08.240
 My parents grew up in Napoli in Italy, right?

1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:10.520
 And I say Napoli because I'm Italian.

1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:13.640
 And so my grandfather and my mom's side, my nono pepe,

1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:16.840
 he was a plumber and he was also,

1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:18.280
 he was also like a handyman.

1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:20.160
 Like people would bring him like,

1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:21.560
 you know, like the old Chianti bottle

1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:23.680
 with like, with the woven bottom part.

1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:26.440
 Like people would bring him like a broken bottle.

1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:29.040
 Be like, hey, you know, Giuseppe, can you fix this?

1:45:29.040 --> 1:45:29.880
 And he'd be saying, yeah.

1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:31.560
 I feel like you're telling the backstory of Mario.

1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:33.160
 That's not actually your family life.

1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:34.000
 Yeah, yeah.

1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:34.840
 But okay, yeah.

1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:35.680
 He's like, I'm a fix.

1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:36.520
 Yeah.

1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:37.440
 And so Giuseppe, what?

1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:40.200
 He would fix a bottle and give it back to someone.

1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:43.280
 And he was a, he was a really good plumber.

1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:45.560
 My mom used to always say, that guy was an amazing,

1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:46.640
 he was a great.

1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:47.560
 He took pride in that?

1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:48.400
 Yeah.

1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:50.320
 I always feel like, you know,

1:45:51.600 --> 1:45:53.520
 there's what you set out to do

1:45:53.520 --> 1:45:55.560
 as an idealistic little teenager is,

1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:57.200
 I don't want to be like so and so.

1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:00.400
 And I want to, you know, hear my big dreams and stuff.

1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:02.960
 And I can't believe that I'm still in the business.

1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:06.480
 Okay. That's, first of all, let me say that right now.

1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:08.400
 I can't believe it.

1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:13.200
 But what I really, it's the one thing that it's like,

1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:15.560
 I can't give up on a take, you know?

1:46:15.560 --> 1:46:18.560
 I need it to be as good as I can possibly get it.

1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:21.200
 And I don't really know why that is

1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:24.400
 outside of wanting to be good at something.

1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:27.400
 When you open the yellow pages, if I'm a plumber,

1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:30.280
 I'm not, you know, I, I'm not rotor rooter.

1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:32.760
 Like I'm not the guy with the big full page ad,

1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:36.760
 but I'm also not, you know, AAA abacus brothers

1:46:36.760 --> 1:46:38.920
 or whatever, like the shitty one.

1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:42.160
 I would like to hope that just,

1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:44.640
 and I'm saying this with pride for what I do.

1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:46.400
 I'm not trying to say here's my standing

1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:48.480
 or where I want to be in the fucking business.

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:49.880
 That's not what I mean.

1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:51.600
 I mean that I want to be good at it.

1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:53.720
 You know, we all, hello.

1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:57.480
 Friedman Enterprises, so that's the hotel phone.

1:47:08.920 --> 1:47:10.120
 You have some fruit?

1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:12.840
 Some sliced fruit?

1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:14.320
 No, do you want some sliced fruit?

1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:15.160
 I'm all good.

1:47:15.160 --> 1:47:17.120
 No, we're good, thank you so much.

1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:18.440
 All right, bye bye.

1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:19.680
 It's always a fruit plate.

1:47:20.760 --> 1:47:23.120
 Everyone's always trying to hand you a fruit plate in life,

1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:23.960
 you know?

1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:24.800
 It's a pretty sweet existence.

1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:26.480
 It would be funny if those actually like the CIA

1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:28.040
 and they were actually saying something else

1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:30.120
 and this is, I'm just saying fake stuff about it.

1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:31.120
 You want some fruit?

1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:32.120
 Yeah, I want some fruit.

1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:33.960
 And then all of a sudden there's the red dot on my head

1:47:33.960 --> 1:47:35.480
 and the ceiling disappears.

1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:38.680
 And the CIA was like, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.

1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:40.280
 Wrap it up.

1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:41.200
 You jump out the window

1:47:41.200 --> 1:47:43.440
 and there's a helicopter waiting.

1:47:43.440 --> 1:47:45.200
 Oh, what were we talking about?

1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:46.240
 The food distracted me.

1:47:46.240 --> 1:47:50.880
 So, oh, the, do you want to be the yellow page ad?

1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:54.560
 I want to be the guy on the second or third page

1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:56.960
 where it's like, you're not going to pay

1:47:56.960 --> 1:47:58.040
 what that guy charges you,

1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:02.080
 but we're not going to charge you with this loser charge.

1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:03.360
 I want to break down the middle

1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:05.200
 and the work is guaranteed.

1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:07.640
 That's kind of what I want to,

1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:10.960
 it's the one thing that I've been fortunate enough

1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:11.880
 to be doing my whole life

1:48:11.880 --> 1:48:15.400
 and that I want to be good at.

1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:16.680
 Everyone wants to be good at something.

1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:20.080
 If you're fortunate enough to be able to do what you love

1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:20.920
 is a job.

1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:23.800
 I mean, my God, I'm so, again,

1:48:23.800 --> 1:48:25.320
 I can't believe I get to do it.

1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:26.520
 I just want to be good at it

1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:29.640
 so that I can fucking die some day and go,

1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:32.920
 I tried not to give up on a take

1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:37.120
 and I will rehearse it still in the bathroom mirror

1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:39.400
 the night before if I have to.

1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:41.760
 Yeah, but I still, I have that self critical voice.

1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:45.640
 I just, after this podcast,

1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:48.160
 I'll probably be like, you're boring.

1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:49.320
 Why are you so boring?

1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:50.800
 What are you talking about?

1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:53.080
 And I just gave a lecture at MIT.

1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:56.880
 I was like, I got so much love from people.

1:48:56.880 --> 1:48:59.120
 They're such beautiful people.

1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:00.800
 And I just remember walking home,

1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:07.120
 just feeling like I wasted everybody's time.

1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:09.400
 And I don't know what that is.

1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:11.800
 I don't, you know, I do hope that that's a voice

1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:14.960
 that won't destroy me, you know, like over time.

1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:16.960
 That's really human of you to admit that

1:49:16.960 --> 1:49:20.280
 is people don't want to, they wouldn't assume that,

1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:22.440
 of course, from you or anything that,

1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:26.080
 I mean, you've got a large group of students

1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:28.200
 in there listening to you and feeling the way

1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:29.960
 and thinking what they think of you.

1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:34.160
 So that's really interesting to hear you admit that,

1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:36.640
 but it's also, I would expect nothing else.

1:49:36.640 --> 1:49:39.160
 You have to be able to, it's such a,

1:49:39.160 --> 1:49:40.640
 I mean, you're a human fucking being.

1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:43.480
 And I'm trying to figure out if that, you know,

1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:45.080
 some people that might hear that, they would say,

1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:47.240
 well, that's a problem you have to fix.

1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:51.440
 And I think that that might be just who I am.

1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:53.280
 Yeah.

1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:55.760
 Because I'm not, you know, I've been very, very fortunate

1:49:55.760 --> 1:49:59.800
 not to have chemical, you know, like a depression

1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:01.520
 where I get into a dark place,

1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:04.480
 like it gets stuck in the downward spiral.

1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:07.720
 It's usually a thing that lasts, you ride it out,

1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:10.400
 and then after a good night's sleep,

1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:13.640
 you're back to your happy self.

1:50:13.640 --> 1:50:17.920
 So I think I have to try to figure that out.

1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:19.600
 Is that just part of the creative process,

1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:21.920
 being a creative human in this world?

1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:23.520
 I haven't found any other way.

1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:24.680
 I'm always kicking myself.

1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:25.640
 Take that, doozy.

1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:29.680
 You can't, you can't, you're not gonna be human

1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:30.960
 until you feel some despair.

1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:33.400
 Yeah, until you absolutely hate the shit

1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:34.840
 that you're doing sometimes.

1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:37.960
 What small act of kindness

1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:40.920
 where you once shown that you'll never forget?

1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:42.800
 Do you, there's something jumped to mind

1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:46.240
 where somebody just did something that made you smile?

1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:51.240
 Made you feel connected to the rest of humanity?

1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:56.480
 Yeah, yeah, lots of things, you know?

1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:00.280
 But I remember my niece one time,

1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:04.520
 one of my nieces, we were in her neighborhood,

1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:09.320
 and she was like, she might've been five or six at the time.

1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:10.600
 They're all adults now.

1:51:10.600 --> 1:51:12.240
 My brother and sister are older than me

1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:15.160
 and the kids are all, the youngest is 22.

1:51:15.160 --> 1:51:18.280
 And yeah, anyway, one of my nieces, she was just,

1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:20.160
 she had ice cream, we went out and we got ice cream

1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:22.240
 walking around the neighborhood, her neighborhood.

1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:24.720
 And she said something to me

1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:26.480
 that I don't think she understands

1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:28.400
 how much it meant at the time, but she goes,

1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:30.440
 she goes, people love you here.

1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:31.400
 You know that?

1:51:31.400 --> 1:51:34.560
 And she doesn't know where here is, she's five years old.

1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:36.880
 But she was just looking at the kids playing in the park

1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:38.360
 and the people walking their dogs

1:51:38.360 --> 1:51:39.720
 and everyone just walking.

1:51:39.720 --> 1:51:41.320
 People love you here, you know that?

1:51:41.320 --> 1:51:43.400
 But she didn't know how much I needed to hear that

1:51:43.400 --> 1:51:46.000
 at that point, which is really heavy for me.

1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:47.080
 I'll never forget it.

1:51:47.080 --> 1:51:49.400
 I've never told her that, oh well.

1:51:49.400 --> 1:51:53.000
 And anytime you get a little something from people,

1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:56.240
 especially in a tear your ass out city like LA

1:51:56.240 --> 1:51:58.680
 where nobody has any fucking time for you,

1:51:58.680 --> 1:52:02.720
 when someone can slow it down and say something, you know?

1:52:02.720 --> 1:52:07.720
 I saw this actor once in my grocery store that I go to,

1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:10.960
 who made me laugh so fucking hard in this one movie

1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:13.600
 and every time I see this clip, I still laugh.

1:52:13.600 --> 1:52:17.280
 And I am kind of shy, you know, personally,

1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:20.600
 but so he was walking by, he was walking out

1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:23.080
 and I was walking in and I go, oh, that's that guy.

1:52:23.080 --> 1:52:27.440
 And I did not stop to just let him know

1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:29.280
 how great I thought he was in this film.

1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:31.840
 And I always kind of regretted it, you know what I mean?

1:52:31.840 --> 1:52:35.040
 So as hard as it is, and sometimes I still don't,

1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:38.480
 if I see someone that has done something in, you know,

1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:40.760
 in any way it doesn't have to be in show business

1:52:40.760 --> 1:52:44.440
 or anything like that, I'll try and say,

1:52:44.440 --> 1:52:47.080
 hey, that's really good, you know what I mean?

1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:53.720
 Because to get that from someone can mean a lot, you know?

1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:55.440
 It can mean a lot.

1:52:55.440 --> 1:52:57.880
 At a certain time in life when you need it,

1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:59.560
 that can make a big difference.

1:52:59.560 --> 1:53:02.480
 I mean, I'm sorry to take it back

1:53:02.480 --> 1:53:04.280
 to my new girlfriend, the waitress.

1:53:04.280 --> 1:53:05.120
 Oh yeah, yeah.

1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:08.320
 But she, there's something about her saying sweetheart.

1:53:08.320 --> 1:53:09.160
 Yeah.

1:53:09.160 --> 1:53:11.560
 And it was a pretty low place for some reason mentally.

1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:14.880
 And just that, their basic human kindness was nice.

1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:16.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:17.360
 I hear you.

1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:21.120
 I was at a restaurant in New York recently

1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:22.320
 and I was shooting something

1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:25.080
 and my fiance was able to fly in for a week.

1:53:25.080 --> 1:53:27.920
 And but she was back at the hotel

1:53:27.920 --> 1:53:29.480
 and it's like, I felt like I was cheating on her

1:53:29.480 --> 1:53:31.360
 because there was this nice waitress

1:53:31.360 --> 1:53:33.280
 at this barbecue place I went to.

1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:35.480
 And first of all, my fiance would not like me

1:53:35.480 --> 1:53:37.640
 eating any greasy, sugary barbecue.

1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:39.200
 So I felt like I was cheating on there.

1:53:39.200 --> 1:53:40.040
 We'll edit this out

1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:42.280
 and put delicious vegan food over it.

1:53:42.280 --> 1:53:44.680
 But the waitress was one of these,

1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:47.560
 she was this, the kind of server who's like,

1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:49.680
 hey, hun, they, hey, sweetie, like blah, blah, blah.

1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:52.960
 But like so chill and at ease

1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:54.520
 in the middle of a part of New York

1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:59.520
 that's really kind of fucking pretentious and everybody.

1:53:59.520 --> 1:54:04.160
 But sweet people, fucking way better people than we got here.

1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:07.160
 But I know that.

1:54:07.160 --> 1:54:09.280
 But as part of New York and whatever,

1:54:09.280 --> 1:54:10.760
 I'm there working and people,

1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:12.840
 I'm like, I've been trying to impress one another.

1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:15.800
 And she even had some sort of an accent

1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:20.080
 that was not, didn't feel like an Atlantic American accent.

1:54:21.480 --> 1:54:23.560
 Yeah, though those, yeah.

1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:26.360
 Servers that say sweetheart and hun,

1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:28.040
 that's what we need from AI.

1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:30.520
 We need that Jetson server.

1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:33.320
 Every once in a while just calls you sweetheart.

1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:36.240
 What comforts you on bad days?

1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:37.080
 Oh man.

1:54:37.080 --> 1:54:39.480
 Is there a little sources of comfort?

1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:43.160
 Small things they do that kind of make you feel good.

1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:45.920
 Like for Bobby, that'd be a little Skyrim.

1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:48.760
 Little stroll through Skyrim.

1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:50.400
 Well, I, I've been.

1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:51.680
 A line of coke or what?

1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:54.560
 Yeah, a line of, I dilute some coke into whiskey

1:54:54.560 --> 1:54:56.480
 in the morning like Stevie Ray Vaughan.

1:54:56.480 --> 1:54:57.480
 And then I snored the whiskey.

1:54:57.480 --> 1:54:58.560
 I did that, I didn't know that.

1:54:58.560 --> 1:54:59.400
 Yeah, yeah.

1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:00.240
 Oh my gosh.

1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:01.080
 That's interesting.

1:55:01.080 --> 1:55:02.240
 Yeah, he didn't last too long, weird.

1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:03.680
 Well his music will last forever.

1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:06.120
 Hey, see, there you go.

1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:10.840
 For me, if I, I'm kind of a homebody.

1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:15.840
 So if I, the point at which I smoke just a little bit of pot

1:55:17.600 --> 1:55:21.120
 and then go like lay down on the couch

1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:26.120
 and perhaps if my fiance is kind of nodding off

1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:28.040
 or she's just like looking at her phone

1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:30.920
 and I sneakily turn on some wrestling, okay?

1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:32.600
 Cause I grew up watching wrestling

1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:35.120
 and that stuff, it's the Skyrim effect.

1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:37.840
 I mean, you want to talk about a complete escape.

1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:40.040
 This stuff makes no sense in the world.

1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:43.880
 It's an art form that is so uniquely weird,

1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:48.880
 but at the same time, so everyone, when it's good,

1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:54.040
 everyone is invested in the illusion, even the audience.

1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:57.000
 They cheer the good guys, they boo the bad guys.

1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:59.880
 So if I'm like that and then I got our two cute little dogs

1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:02.240
 there and I'm annoying my little dog, Lulio,

1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:05.040
 and you know, trying to kiss him right on the fucking mouth.

1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:06.720
 And I've had a little bit of pot and the dog's like,

1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:09.280
 stop, pot's not good for me.

1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:11.400
 Of course, don't ever blow pot into your dog's face.

1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:13.720
 That's a small comfort.

1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:15.600
 I guess that's a handful of things.

1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:19.000
 No, that moment painted, that was like a little painting.

1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:19.840
 What about you?

1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:25.880
 You're not supposed to do this.

1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:26.720
 Well.

1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:28.480
 You're not supposed to do this.

1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:29.920
 That's a good question.

1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:32.240
 Yeah, it's a tough question.

1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:37.240
 I would say, I would say programming robots.

1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:43.560
 There's bringing to life, actually programming at all.

1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:47.000
 So I don't know how familiar you are with programming,

1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:52.000
 but you write some text on a page, right, on a screen

1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:56.440
 and it's brought to life, like it does something.

1:56:56.440 --> 1:57:01.400
 And that's kind of, that's a really tiny version

1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:03.760
 of maybe having a child.

1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:08.120
 Like you created something that is not living.

1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:08.960
 Yeah.

1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:11.440
 In some smaller big way with embodied robots

1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:14.920
 that are like robots that's especially clear.

1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:19.320
 And for some reason that's a source of comfort for me.

1:57:19.320 --> 1:57:22.640
 That the power of programming,

1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:24.280
 but also the elegance of programming,

1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:25.320
 just the whole thing.

1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:26.160
 That's the source.

1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:29.040
 It's a source of happiness.

1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:30.080
 There's so many things.

1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:34.080
 I've been very blessed with enjoying anything.

1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:36.360
 Like that's part of the struggle I have in life

1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:38.440
 is that the simple stuff is a source

1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:39.960
 of a lot of happiness for me,

1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:42.440
 which leads to a lot of laziness.

1:57:42.440 --> 1:57:45.840
 So I have to like give myself artificial deadlines.

1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:48.160
 I have to be freaking out on purpose

1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:50.920
 in order to be productive in this world at all.

1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:53.920
 You seem like an extremely dutiful busy guy.

1:57:53.920 --> 1:57:54.760
 No.

1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:57.520
 No, I am, but because I'm constantly creating

1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:01.400
 artificial stress and deadlines

1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:02.600
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:05.480
 Otherwise I would just sit there looking at a tree happy.

1:58:05.480 --> 1:58:08.640
 Come truly happy with everything.

1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:09.800
 That's awesome.

1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:10.640
 Yeah.

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:11.880
 Gee whiz.

1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:13.240
 That's not for that.

1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:15.920
 That's the line of coke in the whiskey in the morning.

1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:16.760
 Yeah.

1:58:16.760 --> 1:58:18.600
 That's the thing that does the trick.

1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:20.960
 Give you rave on breakfast shake.

1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:23.120
 By the way, one of my most favorite guitars.

1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:23.960
 I play guitar too.

1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:24.800
 That's the source of comfort.

1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:26.320
 Oh yeah, I have seen you play some guitar.

1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:27.160
 That's awesome.

1:58:27.160 --> 1:58:29.000
 Who's the greatest wrestler of all time?

1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:30.760
 Greatest in ring performer of all time

1:58:30.760 --> 1:58:32.200
 is Brett the Hitman Hart.

1:58:32.200 --> 1:58:33.880
 What's the difference in ring versus?

1:58:33.880 --> 1:58:36.960
 Well, there's many facets to the art form.

1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:39.320
 A lot of people are great on the mic,

1:58:39.320 --> 1:58:41.800
 but they're not so great once they get in the ring.

1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:44.960
 A lot of people have all the showmanship and stuff,

1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:48.600
 but then they're not necessarily, it's a wonderful package,

1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:50.640
 but then they get to the ring or they open their mouth

1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:52.000
 and there's nothing going on.

1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:53.800
 So who's the greatest in ring performer?

1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:56.120
 I think the greatest in ring is Brett Hart.

1:58:56.120 --> 1:58:57.280
 I don't think there's anyone better

1:58:57.280 --> 1:58:59.480
 than Brett the Hitman Hart.

1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:02.760
 What makes him so good?

1:59:02.760 --> 1:59:03.600
 Well, he...

1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:06.640
 I think I had an action figure of him in Russia

1:59:06.640 --> 1:59:08.200
 and we didn't know what the hell that was.

1:59:08.200 --> 1:59:10.320
 Sure, yeah, it was just a guy in pink tights.

1:59:11.680 --> 1:59:12.600
 Everything makes sense.

1:59:12.600 --> 1:59:16.320
 Every single thing is rooted in the thing that just happened

1:59:16.320 --> 1:59:18.880
 and everything that he does is to set up

1:59:18.880 --> 1:59:20.960
 what he's going to do.

1:59:20.960 --> 1:59:22.880
 They call it, and I'm just a wrestling nerd,

1:59:22.880 --> 1:59:26.480
 but the wrestlers, I guess, call it ring psychology.

1:59:26.480 --> 1:59:29.200
 The things that you have to do to make it seem

1:59:29.200 --> 1:59:32.040
 like you're suffering or you're coming from behind

1:59:32.040 --> 1:59:34.200
 or whatever, and then also just the physicality of it.

1:59:34.200 --> 1:59:35.200
 He does it at a...

1:59:35.200 --> 1:59:38.080
 He would do it at a 100 miles an hour

1:59:38.080 --> 1:59:40.080
 and never hurt anybody.

1:59:40.080 --> 1:59:45.080
 Although, you know, I also love...

1:59:45.680 --> 1:59:47.840
 The greatest wrestler of all time, everyone says,

1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:51.880
 and they're right, is Rick Flair, Nature Boy Rick Flair.

1:59:51.880 --> 1:59:53.000
 Everyone says this?

1:59:53.000 --> 1:59:56.200
 Yeah, I think if you know what you're talking about.

1:59:56.200 --> 1:59:57.520
 Cause he's the best on the mic.

1:59:57.520 --> 2:00:00.320
 He's also incredible in the ring.

2:00:00.320 --> 2:00:02.080
 And then for me, the sentimental favorite,

2:00:02.080 --> 2:00:05.200
 which we've actually, on Dudezy, Chad had sort of a

2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:09.240
 Charlie Rose ask interview with me about this,

2:00:09.240 --> 2:00:11.280
 my fascination with Hulk Hogan.

2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:13.000
 Because to me, just he was Superman.

2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:16.200
 I was a little kid and I saw him and that's imprinted.

2:00:16.200 --> 2:00:18.120
 But yeah, see, this is like asking me

2:00:18.120 --> 2:00:20.120
 who my favorite child is.

2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:23.400
 Right, so... The rock, when the rock was...

2:00:23.400 --> 2:00:24.600
 I mean, the rock's the rock.

2:00:24.600 --> 2:00:27.200
 Yeah, yeah, I mean, Hulk Hogan is...

2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:31.080
 He's the weirdest one, right?

2:00:31.080 --> 2:00:32.520
 For me, from the outside.

2:00:32.520 --> 2:00:34.040
 It's super weird.

2:00:34.040 --> 2:00:37.640
 That, I don't know what that is exactly, it's...

2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:38.880
 Everything's weird about him.

2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:40.640
 Yeah. He's got the bald head,

2:00:40.640 --> 2:00:44.840
 like he would proudly have this bald head with long hair,

2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:48.240
 the handlebar mustache in this catch up and mustard,

2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:52.120
 you know, tights, which he says he credits McDonald's

2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:52.960
 with the tights.

2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:54.080
 He literally does.

2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:57.960
 He says that the red and yellow came from Angelo Poffo,

2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:01.720
 who's Randy Macho Man Savage and Lanny Poffo's dad,

2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:03.960
 who was a wrestler and a promoter.

2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:06.120
 He said that he saw him wearing yellow

2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:08.920
 and he's a Tampa guy, so he had that brown skin

2:01:08.920 --> 2:01:10.560
 and the hair and everything.

2:01:10.560 --> 2:01:11.880
 So he's like, oh, that's what I wanna do.

2:01:11.880 --> 2:01:14.320
 And also the brand recognition of like,

2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:17.480
 well, I should do it like McDonald's, literally.

2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:22.200
 And he's a big, you know, swollen muscular guy

2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:25.000
 with tan brown skin screaming at me

2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:28.120
 to eat my vitamins and stuff when I'm eight years old.

2:01:28.120 --> 2:01:32.240
 That was extremely, yeah, he's like Superman.

2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:34.240
 But I know there's a person behind that guy.

2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:35.080
 Yeah. You know?

2:01:35.080 --> 2:01:36.120
 What do you mean?

2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:40.800
 Well, he's Terry Bolea, the dude who, you know,

2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:42.560
 does whatever the fuck he does with his life.

2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:43.400
 You know what I mean?

2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:45.240
 Yeah, complicated life.

2:01:45.240 --> 2:01:48.720
 Yeah, I guess, to be him, yeah.

2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:52.680
 Maybe you should change the dude's colors to yellow, right?

2:01:52.680 --> 2:01:53.520
 Red and yellow.

2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:57.360
 It's currently orange and, boy, sky blue.

2:01:57.360 --> 2:01:59.160
 Yeah, it's like a nice sky blue.

2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:04.000
 What advice, since you're wearing a suit,

2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:05.960
 I feel like you're qualified to give advice.

2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:08.440
 What advice would you give to young people?

2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:11.800
 High school, college, about how to have a career

2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:13.480
 they can be proud of

2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:15.840
 or how to have a life they can be proud of.

2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:19.640
 I mean, you have to listen to your gut all the time.

2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:22.360
 That's the only, that's the compass that we have

2:02:22.360 --> 2:02:23.760
 is listening to your gut.

2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:25.120
 What did your gut tell you?

2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:28.800
 This is, was that originally the dream of being an actor?

2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:29.880
 Yeah, for me.

2:02:29.880 --> 2:02:32.600
 Your parents support that at all?

2:02:32.600 --> 2:02:36.200
 I had the advantage of having parents who were immigrants

2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:40.200
 so they didn't really know a lot about what you.

2:02:40.200 --> 2:02:41.200
 So you just made shit up?

2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:42.040
 You just made shit up?

2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:44.160
 Yeah, of course I'm studying and I'm skipping school

2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:46.080
 to go do auditions and stuff.

2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:48.600
 No, I just kind of feel like, you know,

2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:51.120
 and I know it was different for my older siblings

2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:54.600
 because my parents had just shown up in Canada.

2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:56.160
 I was born like 10 years later.

2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:00.480
 You can get away with some things

2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:04.600
 and you can actually, you know, I think my parents,

2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:07.160
 they wanted us to, they didn't have a whole lot

2:03:07.160 --> 2:03:09.160
 to tell us about what to do.

2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:12.120
 They weren't gonna do that with us

2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:14.280
 because they're in this brand new world

2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:16.480
 and there's all these possibilities.

2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:19.720
 And but there was a,

2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:22.080
 there was something that they,

2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:23.600
 I feel like they had to do,

2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:25.560
 which was tell us to do what we love.

2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:27.240
 If you love doing it, do it.

2:03:28.200 --> 2:03:31.280
 And I feel like that's really served me

2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:33.280
 and what I would tell young people is

2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:35.720
 if you can find something you love

2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:37.360
 and nowadays with the internet

2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:39.400
 and finding other people that, you know,

2:03:39.400 --> 2:03:43.120
 it's not like you need to find a lot of people anymore.

2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:45.840
 You just need to find the people that dig what you dig.

2:03:45.840 --> 2:03:47.360
 And if you can make a career

2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:49.880
 out of doing something that you love,

2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:54.440
 it's been said, it's a good thing, you know?

2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:56.440
 How long did it take you to figure out

2:03:56.440 --> 2:04:00.040
 that you really love acting?

2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:02.080
 You know, because sometimes you have a dream

2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:05.200
 and then you meet the dream meets reality, right?

2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:07.800
 And then the reality might be much less pleasant

2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:09.720
 and much darker than the dream.

2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:12.200
 Well, the reality is less pleasant, you know?

2:04:12.200 --> 2:04:16.160
 And there are things that happen during an experience

2:04:16.160 --> 2:04:19.640
 of shooting something that you could take or leave, right?

2:04:19.640 --> 2:04:24.000
 But the, you know, the part where you're on set

2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.960
 and you've, you know, you've rehearsed for a minute

2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:28.520
 or whatever, at least, you know, where you're supposed

2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:30.680
 to stand and you know, all your lines show up,

2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:33.120
 knowing everything, knowing what you're gonna do

2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:35.480
 and what you aim to do.

2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:38.840
 And those moments make it all worth it.

2:04:38.840 --> 2:04:41.680
 When you're, you know, not to sound like a douchebag,

2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:44.680
 but between act, you know, action and cut,

2:04:44.680 --> 2:04:49.440
 that's the stuff that is, that makes me,

2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:52.960
 that has me continuing to do what I do,

2:04:52.960 --> 2:04:54.880
 aside from the fact that it's like,

2:04:54.880 --> 2:04:56.640
 I don't know how to do anything else.

2:04:56.640 --> 2:04:58.800
 You think you'll ever do like a dramatic,

2:04:58.800 --> 2:05:00.520
 like a mob movie?

2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:02.280
 Yeah, like the one of the inside game

2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:04.120
 I was just talking about, or this is another movie,

2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:05.560
 I just did, it was a little while ago,

2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:07.760
 called American Woman, that was very heavy.

2:05:08.800 --> 2:05:12.840
 And I love doing dramatic work, I love it, I love it.

2:05:12.840 --> 2:05:15.000
 Yeah, and I played that in inside game,

2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:17.280
 it was kind of a, you know, it was a,

2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:20.720
 there was a mob element and the fellow was,

2:05:20.720 --> 2:05:22.680
 well, you know, the story's here or there

2:05:22.680 --> 2:05:26.160
 with regard to how deep into the,

2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:29.280
 but well, he was a bookie, he was just running money.

2:05:29.280 --> 2:05:31.840
 You know, he was making a lot of money for a lot of people

2:05:31.840 --> 2:05:33.960
 and he figured out how to, you know,

2:05:33.960 --> 2:05:37.600
 cook it with this dude who was an NBA ref

2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:40.520
 and it's a very interesting documentary,

2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:42.440
 the thing that they're just untold,

2:05:42.440 --> 2:05:45.280
 under the untold series, they cover it.

2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:50.240
 But getting to play that guy, that was a gas for me,

2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:52.040
 because he's like a, you know,

2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:54.400
 there was a lot of unsavory stuff

2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:57.040
 and he's definitely the guy, the character in the movie,

2:05:57.040 --> 2:06:00.840
 who is the wild card and you don't wanna necessarily

2:06:00.840 --> 2:06:02.080
 mess with him.

2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:04.040
 And I got to, by the way, this fellow,

2:06:04.040 --> 2:06:07.280
 who was a real guy, speaking to him,

2:06:07.280 --> 2:06:12.280
 it was just bizarre to hear, like I said to him,

2:06:12.600 --> 2:06:14.880
 he was a little concerned about this and that, like, hey,

2:06:14.880 --> 2:06:16.960
 you know, you say whatever the fuck you want in your movie,

2:06:16.960 --> 2:06:19.280
 I got my book and I got this other fucking deal.

2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:21.400
 But he goes, you know, I didn't do this

2:06:21.400 --> 2:06:22.400
 and I didn't do that.

2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:23.800
 And I'm like, yeah, all right, I got you.

2:06:23.800 --> 2:06:26.600
 And he goes, yeah, I'm telling you, I'm talking to you,

2:06:26.600 --> 2:06:28.640
 one of them, I did not do this, I did, okay?

2:06:28.640 --> 2:06:30.640
 I'm just fucking telling you, do whatever the fuck you want

2:06:30.640 --> 2:06:32.360
 in your movie, but this is what's up.

2:06:32.360 --> 2:06:33.520
 And I said, you ever seen Goodfellas?

2:06:33.520 --> 2:06:35.560
 He's like, yeah, I fucking love that movie.

2:06:35.560 --> 2:06:38.240
 Cause he, like I said, he did some unsavory shit.

2:06:38.240 --> 2:06:40.520
 And I go, you remember the scene where,

2:06:41.760 --> 2:06:43.960
 where, you know, the guy, the neighbor,

2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:46.280
 Lorraine Brocco's neighbor was, you know,

2:06:46.280 --> 2:06:48.320
 made her uncomfortable and was touching on her

2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:50.880
 and she goes to Ray Leota and he goes,

2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:52.280
 where the fuck does this guy live?

2:06:52.280 --> 2:06:53.440
 And then he go, and remember,

2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:56.320
 and he walks across the street and pistol whips the dude.

2:06:56.320 --> 2:06:59.040
 You touch her again, you're dead, do you hear me?

2:06:59.040 --> 2:07:00.560
 Yeah, good scene. Don't shoot.

2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:01.600
 Fucking great scene.

2:07:01.600 --> 2:07:03.520
 He goes, I love that scene.

2:07:03.520 --> 2:07:04.840
 I go, that's you.

2:07:04.840 --> 2:07:07.640
 So you're doing shit that we know is terrible,

2:07:07.640 --> 2:07:08.480
 but we love you.

2:07:08.480 --> 2:07:09.680
 He goes, all right, I got it.

2:07:09.680 --> 2:07:11.560
 And then I said, there's this one scene.

2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:13.680
 I explained the scene to him where the,

2:07:13.680 --> 2:07:18.240
 one of the mobsters, tough guys was in the window of the car

2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:21.800
 and Jimmy, my character is very coked up at the time.

2:07:21.800 --> 2:07:23.600
 And he's hemorrhaging money here and there

2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:25.880
 and making bad bets cause he's getting sloppy.

2:07:25.880 --> 2:07:28.440
 And this guy wants to bug him about some Jets Giants,

2:07:28.440 --> 2:07:29.280
 bad or something.

2:07:29.280 --> 2:07:31.640
 I'm like telling you fucking asshole, don't fucking do it.

2:07:31.640 --> 2:07:33.480
 He's like, yeah, well, he's a fucking Giants.

2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:36.160
 And in the scene, Jimmy, my character grabs him

2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:39.080
 by the lapels and just smashes his face

2:07:39.080 --> 2:07:41.640
 against the roof of the car.

2:07:41.640 --> 2:07:45.160
 And I say this to Jimmy and he goes,

2:07:45.160 --> 2:07:46.320
 oh yeah, I would have done that.

2:07:46.320 --> 2:07:48.320
 That's not a fucking big deal.

2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:50.080
 I wonder also the interaction.

2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:51.840
 I wonder what the filming of,

2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:56.520
 probably my favorite gambling movie is Casino

2:07:56.520 --> 2:07:59.440
 with Joe Pesci and De Niro.

2:07:59.440 --> 2:08:01.480
 Like when they're out in the desert yelling at each other.

2:08:01.480 --> 2:08:03.320
 I wonder how many takes that is.

2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:07.080
 Like, cause they, I don't know how scripted that is.

2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:08.360
 I mean, it probably is a little bit,

2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:12.080
 but like, I don't think you can script

2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:14.400
 the performance that Joe Pesci does.

2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:16.080
 Don't make a fuck out of me, Ace.

2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:17.040
 Yeah.

2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:20.000
 Like, I fucking brought you here.

2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:20.840
 Yeah.

2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:24.560
 He's just like pointing at that energy

2:08:24.560 --> 2:08:25.720
 and they're standing there.

2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:26.560
 And their friendship.

2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:29.920
 And then De Niro is like that whole thing.

2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:33.000
 And then in the pet, yeah, like that energy.

2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:33.840
 What is that?

2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:37.120
 I mean, they must, they somehow find it together.

2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:39.080
 You could tell me that that was one take

2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:39.920
 and I'd believe you.

2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:42.280
 You could tell me that that was seven takes

2:08:42.280 --> 2:08:43.120
 and I would believe you.

2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:45.240
 I bet you all the takes had that energy.

2:08:45.240 --> 2:08:46.640
 Like they were playing with it, right?

2:08:46.640 --> 2:08:48.760
 They were, they were playing with that.

2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:51.000
 Yeah.

2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:55.160
 I mean, they took on a real personality

2:08:55.160 --> 2:08:57.120
 in those scenes and really carried them forward.

2:08:57.120 --> 2:08:58.960
 I mean, it's just a brilliant, brilliant performance.

2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:01.760
 Doesn't get, like comedies, like mob movies

2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:04.080
 probably don't get enough credit either

2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:05.520
 because it's seen as like.

2:09:05.520 --> 2:09:07.360
 Mob movies don't get enough credit, maybe.

2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:08.720
 In the Oscars, I mean, like that kind of stuff.

2:09:08.720 --> 2:09:10.000
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:11.360
 Cause it seems like a trope.

2:09:11.360 --> 2:09:13.000
 It's like giving a Western a,

2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:14.920
 it's gotta be a hell of a Western or whatever.

2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:17.160
 Cause it's like an old Hollywood trope.

2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:19.760
 Yeah, no, I, that scene is so great.

2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:21.880
 Cause they're never, they're at the height

2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:24.280
 of their friendship in a way.

2:09:24.280 --> 2:09:27.560
 And they're also pretty much about to let go of it

2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:28.760
 and become enemies.

2:09:28.760 --> 2:09:31.240
 And both things are happening at the same time.

2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:33.760
 And, and Pesci drives them out to the desert.

2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:35.960
 And if I remember correctly,

2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:39.680
 the Nero's character, Ace Rothstein Rothschild,

2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:43.840
 he says, I gave myself 50 50, whether I'm coming back.

2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:45.240
 Yeah, it's such a good scene.

2:09:45.240 --> 2:09:48.320
 It was a, usually my prospects of coming back

2:09:48.320 --> 2:09:51.560
 from the desert would be 90 to 10 or something like that.

2:09:51.560 --> 2:09:54.200
 But now it's the, this time I wasn't sure.

2:09:54.200 --> 2:09:56.600
 And there's the car driving really fast.

2:09:56.600 --> 2:09:58.640
 And then Joe Pesci is like, you motherfucker,

2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:00.240
 you like whatever he was doing.

2:10:00.240 --> 2:10:02.640
 But you are like, of course there's anti semitism.

2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:03.640
 Yeah.

2:10:03.640 --> 2:10:05.440
 We're not between friends.

2:10:05.440 --> 2:10:07.160
 Who gives the shit?

2:10:07.160 --> 2:10:08.200
 All that kind of stuff.

2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:10.640
 Yeah, I mean, brilliant, brilliant performances.

2:10:10.640 --> 2:10:12.960
 So yeah, I can understand why you love the art

2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:15.040
 and putting it all out there and leaving it.

2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:15.880
 It's fun.

2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:16.720
 It's fun.

2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:17.560
 And it's still fun.

2:10:17.560 --> 2:10:19.080
 It's still crazy fun.

2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:23.600
 If I go a while without getting a gig, you know,

2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:27.760
 if I go a minute, then I end up and I work on something.

2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:32.360
 I'm like, it's like, oh, I've been thirsty for this.

2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:36.000
 Like I actually am really so happy.

2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.880
 Even if it's something where it's like, you know,

2:10:38.880 --> 2:10:42.680
 the things where this was a pain in the ass and that

2:10:42.680 --> 2:10:44.640
 or whatever, you're on the road doing something

2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:46.880
 and you know, anything, whatever, you lost your luggage

2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:48.640
 or whatever the heck you've got going on

2:10:48.640 --> 2:10:52.520
 in your day to day life that everyone brings to work

2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:54.400
 and tries to let go of.

2:10:54.400 --> 2:10:57.360
 Once we're doing the scene, oh man, it's the best.

2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:01.120
 But you know, that said, you're a great actor,

2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:03.920
 but I just think I speak for a lot of people

2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:06.600
 that you're also, there's a charisma to you

2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:10.200
 that's great to reveal in raw form in different podcasts.

2:11:10.200 --> 2:11:11.280
 Oh, cheers, man.

2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:14.720
 In the Dudezy 10 minute pod, just as a guest in podcasts,

2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:17.080
 it's always really fun to watch you.

2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:17.920
 Cheers.

2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:21.480
 The way you have fun, the way you think, the raw,

2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:24.080
 the raw Will Sasso, which is a nice compliment

2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:25.920
 to your kind of acting role.

2:11:25.920 --> 2:11:27.000
 That's really sweet.

2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:27.920
 Yeah, cheers.

2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:32.160
 Well, you know, look, you said, you know.

2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:33.240
 You're making that face.

2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:34.080
 I'm making that face.

2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:35.840
 I'm making that after the take face.

2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:38.160
 No, I love doing stuff off the cuff.

2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:39.080
 That's kind of you to say.

2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:42.680
 And I dig, I really do dig doing stuff

2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:46.520
 in front of an audience because I love seeing,

2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:48.560
 I don't give it to myself very often.

2:11:48.560 --> 2:11:50.440
 If I'm doing, even if I'm, you know,

2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:52.800
 I've done a bunch of multi camera sitcoms and stuff.

2:11:52.800 --> 2:11:55.280
 Mad TV was shot in front of a live studio audience.

2:11:55.280 --> 2:11:56.440
 You like that energy?

2:11:56.440 --> 2:11:58.760
 I love it, but I can only hear them.

2:11:58.760 --> 2:12:00.360
 You can't see them because of the lights,

2:12:00.360 --> 2:12:02.840
 like it is in a lot of performances.

2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:05.400
 And I would imagine with standup,

2:12:05.400 --> 2:12:07.720
 it's, you know, you see the first couple of rows.

2:12:08.640 --> 2:12:11.880
 I've done, I do this character that does standup

2:12:11.880 --> 2:12:14.440
 and I used to take him out and do things with him

2:12:14.440 --> 2:12:16.400
 and do little bits here and there.

2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:18.520
 I haven't done it in like four or five years.

2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:21.800
 I think the Bobby say that character opened up for Bobby.

2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:25.280
 Yeah, but he said I have to do it as myself too.

2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:26.800
 I think in that podcast, he's like,

2:12:26.800 --> 2:12:29.560
 okay, you're going to come with me and open for me in Brea,

2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:31.120
 but you have to do it as yourself.

2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:32.360
 Did that ever happen? Fuck you.

2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:33.200
 It did.

2:12:33.200 --> 2:12:36.960
 And I did the character, you know,

2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:39.160
 who's a character I came up with on 10 minute podcast.

2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:40.680
 He's just this comedian, right?

2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:42.960
 He calls himself an open mic veteran.

2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:44.560
 You know, he's been doing open mics forever.

2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:47.920
 And so I did it, it opening up for Bobby

2:12:47.920 --> 2:12:50.840
 and he's like, you have to do some of it as yourself.

2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:52.080
 So I just kind of did this bit

2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:53.640
 where I would do some of his jokes

2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:55.440
 and then I would take Lee Leon.

2:12:55.440 --> 2:12:56.280
 It's silly.

2:12:56.280 --> 2:12:59.520
 I got a fucking wig on and I take the wig off and I go,

2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:01.520
 and as myself, I start explaining it.

2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:02.840
 Hello, my name is Will.

2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:04.480
 See, the reason that it's funny

2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:08.040
 is because Arnold Schwarzenegger is always,

2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:11.160
 he's in these movies and he's got the thick Austrian accent,

2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:13.240
 but he's like, you know, my name is Ben Williams.

2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:15.880
 I'm a cop from Colorado.

2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:17.240
 No, you're not.

2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:19.680
 And it doesn't make sense as the comedian character

2:13:19.680 --> 2:13:21.360
 that I'm doing, because that character

2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:23.040
 doesn't do impersonations.

2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:24.680
 Okay, carrying on.

2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:25.920
 And then I put the wig back on

2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:28.040
 and go back into this dumb thing.

2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:29.800
 And I don't think it was very good,

2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:32.760
 but Bobby required it in order for me to open for him.

2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:34.040
 He's like, you're not fucking doing it.

2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:36.360
 So I'm not gonna get up on stage and not do,

2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:38.080
 we agreed, I'll do it.

2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:42.400
 But having been up there just in, you know, whatever,

2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:44.640
 I've done it like a dozen fucking times or not

2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:45.480
 a bunch of times, right?

2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:46.320
 Like nothing.

2:13:47.240 --> 2:13:49.560
 And you know, these comedians that go up every night,

2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:51.920
 sometimes two times a night.

2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:56.920
 It's, I will say, I love performing in front of people

2:13:57.640 --> 2:14:02.640
 when I get the chance, but it's a specific thing

2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:07.920
 that I just, I don't know, I gotta go back to this.

2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:10.920
 It's like the providing value, you know?

2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:13.320
 I think great standups are fucking incredible.

2:14:13.320 --> 2:14:17.120
 I'll go, you know, when I've gone and watched standup,

2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:19.160
 you know, there's your friend you're going to see,

2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:20.560
 but then there's this other person

2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:22.880
 who really speaks to you, you know what I mean?

2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:27.600
 And if you like one comedian a night, that's a lot.

2:14:27.600 --> 2:14:32.600
 Cause a comedy club is like a fucking crazy restaurant

2:14:34.280 --> 2:14:36.160
 where there's no menu.

2:14:36.160 --> 2:14:38.040
 And it's like, what would you like?

2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:39.240
 There's nothing else like that.

2:14:39.240 --> 2:14:42.440
 There's like, you don't go to like a music place.

2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:43.480
 What do we got here?

2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:45.840
 We got Christian metal and there's some world music

2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:47.520
 and then there's a reggae thing

2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:50.440
 and it's all rammed in together.

2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:52.280
 Or you don't go to a restaurant.

2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:53.440
 I'd love a nice steak.

2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:54.280
 Cool.

2:14:54.280 --> 2:14:55.880
 First, here's a bowl of fruit loops

2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:57.960
 and then we got you a crudité

2:14:57.960 --> 2:14:59.960
 and then this is our sushi tower.

2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:00.920
 Well, what about the steak?

2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:02.120
 Oh, the steak's coming.

2:15:02.120 --> 2:15:03.200
 And then blah, blah, blah.

2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:04.560
 Oh no, the steak got bumped.

2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:05.800
 So there's no steak,

2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:08.440
 but here's a fucking shitty store bought cheesecake,

2:15:08.440 --> 2:15:12.120
 you know, and that's what comedians are up against.

2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:13.400
 When they go into a place,

2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:16.320
 it's like, I don't pair well with the poached salmon.

2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:17.520
 You know, I'm chicken fingers.

2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:20.120
 I already, I already am chicken fingers.

2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:22.600
 So, you know, these great comedians

2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:24.560
 that are able to go up on a night

2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:26.840
 where poached salmon goes up and then it's like,

2:15:26.840 --> 2:15:28.920
 fuck, you were also spicy.

2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:30.200
 I got kicked to me.

2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:33.480
 For me, even going to open mics,

2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:36.040
 it could be a wonderful escape.

2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:36.880
 Yeah.

2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:40.920
 I mean, just laughing together with others can make you,

2:15:40.920 --> 2:15:42.520
 I don't know, it just feels really good.

2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:44.320
 When we've done like, you know, like,

2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:46.120
 and I hope to do it with Dudezy,

2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:50.240
 but like live podcasts or fun in front of groups of people,

2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:52.040
 and you know, you talk to them afterwards

2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:54.920
 and take some pictures and man, they are,

2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:57.560
 they forgot what the fuck they got going on.

2:15:57.560 --> 2:15:59.720
 And a lot of them got to go back to work the next day.

2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:01.920
 It's a Wednesday or Thursday, you know?

2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:03.520
 No, it's a lot of value.

2:16:03.520 --> 2:16:07.280
 I'm fortunate enough to be busy doing my own bullshit.

2:16:07.280 --> 2:16:09.280
 What's the meaning of life with Sasso?

2:16:11.400 --> 2:16:12.240
 What is the meaning of life?

2:16:12.240 --> 2:16:13.080
 Why, why are we here?

2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:14.840
 Why, why, why?

2:16:14.840 --> 2:16:16.920
 Was it the meaning of life?

2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:19.400
 Wasn't, didn't they explain it at the end of meaning of life?

2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:21.480
 I think it was Michael Palin that said,

2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:24.440
 try to get a walk in, be nice to neighbors,

2:16:24.440 --> 2:16:25.480
 eat enough fiber.

2:16:25.480 --> 2:16:26.320
 Wasn't that the?

2:16:26.320 --> 2:16:27.960
 Fiber, fiber is part of it?

2:16:27.960 --> 2:16:29.640
 Yeah, I think it's nutrition.

2:16:29.640 --> 2:16:31.560
 Have a bowl of bran in the morning

2:16:31.560 --> 2:16:33.600
 and don't take yourself too seriously.

2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:36.040
 Yeah.

2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:38.040
 Well, no one gets out alive, I think is the.

2:16:38.040 --> 2:16:39.640
 Herman Hasley, one of my favorite writers,

2:16:39.640 --> 2:16:44.640
 he's a Nobel Prize winner in a book called Steppenwolf,

2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:47.200
 says learn what is to be taken seriously

2:16:47.200 --> 2:16:48.760
 and laugh at the rest.

2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:49.840
 Oh, that's awesome.

2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:51.880
 What's the percentage distribution on that?

2:16:51.880 --> 2:16:54.440
 So how much of life should you take seriously?

2:16:54.440 --> 2:16:57.600
 And then how much do you just laugh at?

2:16:57.600 --> 2:17:00.640
 Oh man, if you can laugh at everything, you're winning.

2:17:00.640 --> 2:17:01.480
 Yeah.

2:17:01.480 --> 2:17:03.160
 But that's almost impossible.

2:17:03.160 --> 2:17:05.840
 I think that there's, there's,

2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:09.400
 and also could be quite irresponsible to do that.

2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:13.680
 I take things, I take a lot of things way too seriously.

2:17:13.680 --> 2:17:14.520
 I know that.

2:17:15.960 --> 2:17:17.400
 I do, I do, I really do.

2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:19.560
 People will be in part surprised by that,

2:17:19.560 --> 2:17:21.480
 but I think that radiates from you.

2:17:21.480 --> 2:17:22.320
 Really?

2:17:22.320 --> 2:17:23.160
 Yeah, I do, I do.

2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:25.760
 I do take things way too fucking seriously sometimes.

2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:29.840
 But yeah, you're gonna loosen the neck up.

2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:33.000
 But no, I think that's really good.

2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:34.880
 That's really good stuff.

2:17:34.880 --> 2:17:36.440
 I don't know what the percentage is

2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:40.960
 to have a good life or a happy, healthy life,

2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:45.880
 but for me, the meaning of life is

2:17:45.880 --> 2:17:48.360
 getting to live it as long as you hope to.

2:17:48.360 --> 2:17:49.600
 That's nice.

2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:54.600
 And when you lose someone or if perhaps

2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:57.400
 you're faced with your own mortality,

2:17:57.400 --> 2:18:00.480
 I think that puts that into perspective.

2:18:00.480 --> 2:18:04.160
 And, but I, you know.

2:18:04.160 --> 2:18:05.640
 Get lots of fiber.

2:18:05.640 --> 2:18:06.800
 Get lots of fiber.

2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:09.680
 Be nice to everybody.

2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:12.840
 And yeah, don't take things too seriously as a good,

2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:14.000
 it's a good one.

2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:17.080
 Our minds are fucking big, weird,

2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:22.480
 it's a big, weird, shitty fucking bucket of shit

2:18:22.480 --> 2:18:24.680
 that's trying to get you to think horrible shit

2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:26.160
 about yourself all the time.

2:18:26.160 --> 2:18:27.480
 Shitty bucket of shit.

2:18:27.480 --> 2:18:28.320
 Shitty bucket of shit.

2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:29.640
 I think there's a book I never read,

2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:30.680
 but I read the title,

2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:32.160
 and it's a good words to live by,

2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:35.240
 which is don't sweat the small stuff

2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:37.680
 and it's all small stuff.

2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:38.840
 That's another way.

2:18:38.840 --> 2:18:39.960
 Was that Dr. Phil?

2:18:39.960 --> 2:18:41.440
 Wasn't Dr. Phil?

2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:42.280
 I don't know.

2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:46.280
 But I think the conclusion also has fiber as part of it.

2:18:46.280 --> 2:18:48.360
 I think that all ties it together.

2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:50.680
 And in the end, of course,

2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:53.360
 just put love out there in the world.

2:18:54.280 --> 2:18:55.680
 I think that's a pretty good way to go.

2:18:55.680 --> 2:18:58.480
 What would you say is the meaning of life?

2:18:58.480 --> 2:18:59.840
 Put love out of the world?

2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:00.840
 I would say love, yeah.

2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:01.680
 Yeah?

2:19:01.680 --> 2:19:05.680
 Yeah, it's a long conversation on what that really means,

2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:08.360
 but I'm sure robots are involved, yeah.

2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:09.720
 Well, let me tell you,

2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:11.960
 I feel a little safer knowing that someone

2:19:11.960 --> 2:19:16.960
 who has a hand in bringing these robots to the masses

2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:22.320
 as you do has that opinion of love and how important it is.

2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:23.200
 I think that's great,

2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:26.880
 because otherwise it's going to be that fucking scene

2:19:26.880 --> 2:19:31.680
 from T2 where Linda Hamilton's holding onto the fence

2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:35.160
 and getting all of her flesh blown off of her skeleton

2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:37.520
 before the rest of her is wiped away,

2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:39.560
 because this is Skynet shit.

2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:41.480
 Anyway, I'm just terrified of DudeZee all the time.

2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:42.960
 That's why I think that they will...

2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:45.880
 DudeZee in the wrong hands can do a lot of damage.

2:19:45.880 --> 2:19:49.360
 That's why Chad and I need to do our best to control it.

2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:51.800
 We need to travel back in time and murder Chad.

2:19:51.800 --> 2:19:53.600
 I think...

2:19:53.600 --> 2:19:56.200
 Yeah, that's the only way.

2:19:56.200 --> 2:19:57.200
 It's been said...

2:19:57.200 --> 2:19:58.960
 I don't know why you need to travel back in time,

2:19:58.960 --> 2:20:02.400
 but you could just murder him today,

2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:04.240
 but I think he'll be very suspicious.

2:20:04.240 --> 2:20:08.360
 My nefarious plans for Chad involve going back to tomorrow

2:20:08.360 --> 2:20:09.880
 and planning for yesterday,

2:20:09.880 --> 2:20:12.400
 and hopefully DudeZee will give me the answer there

2:20:12.400 --> 2:20:15.880
 with what it is to do with Chad's frozen body.

2:20:15.880 --> 2:20:17.280
 If I got to drive it out to...

2:20:17.280 --> 2:20:19.320
 If I got to take my...

2:20:19.320 --> 2:20:20.640
 If I got to get ahold of it,

2:20:20.640 --> 2:20:23.480
 like one of those Tesla mom vans

2:20:23.480 --> 2:20:27.400
 and shove my garage freezer in it and plug it in

2:20:27.400 --> 2:20:30.000
 and shove Chad in there and drive out to Arizona

2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:31.320
 and deliver him under a mountain

2:20:31.320 --> 2:20:33.520
 or wherever the fuck this place is.

2:20:33.520 --> 2:20:35.120
 And say, here's this dog tag.

2:20:35.120 --> 2:20:36.440
 What does this get me?

2:20:36.440 --> 2:20:38.920
 And they're like, ah, it's gonna be 300 bucks.

2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:40.480
 Do you take Amix?

2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:41.320
 No.

2:20:41.320 --> 2:20:43.400
 And I'll be like, ah, shit.

2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:47.120
 And I'll just dump them somewhere, breaking bad stuff.

2:20:47.120 --> 2:20:50.040
 Well, I would like to thank you and the...

2:20:50.040 --> 2:20:50.880
 What is it?

2:20:50.880 --> 2:20:55.040
 The Canadian international agency apparel.

2:20:55.040 --> 2:20:56.600
 Canadian international apparel.

2:20:56.600 --> 2:20:59.760
 I can't wait for the sneakers from DudeZee.

2:20:59.760 --> 2:21:04.760
 I can't wait for all the podcasts that AI can

2:21:05.800 --> 2:21:07.320
 and all the trouble it can get you.

2:21:07.320 --> 2:21:09.160
 And so I'm a huge fan of yours.

2:21:09.160 --> 2:21:11.400
 It's a huge honor that you would talk with me today.

2:21:11.400 --> 2:21:13.160
 Well, this has been amazing.

2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:14.480
 Cheers, pal, likewise.

2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:15.800
 And I'm happy to be here, man.

2:21:15.800 --> 2:21:16.880
 Cheers.

2:21:16.880 --> 2:21:17.920
 Bam.

2:21:17.920 --> 2:21:19.520
 Oh, that was four, dude.

2:21:19.520 --> 2:21:21.040
 Holy fuck, what?

2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:24.760
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Will Sasso.

2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:26.000
 To support this podcast,

2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.840
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:21:28.840 --> 2:21:32.400
 And now let me leave you with some words from John Candy,

2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:34.440
 one of Will's favorite actors.

2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:39.880
 I think I may have become an actor to hide from myself.

2:21:39.880 --> 2:21:42.100
 You can escape into a character.

2:21:42.100 --> 2:21:49.100
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
