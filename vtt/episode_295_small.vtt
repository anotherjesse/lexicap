00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
 slaves produces surplus which the master gets, serfs produces surplus which the lord gets,

00:06.880 --> 00:16.000
 employees produces surplus which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative

00:16.000 --> 00:26.160
 class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another

00:26.160 --> 00:34.640
 group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,

00:34.640 --> 00:41.280
 resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle.

00:43.680 --> 00:49.440
 The following is a conversation with Richard Wolff. One of the top Marxist economists and

00:49.440 --> 00:57.360
 philosophers in the world. This is a heavy topic, in general and for me personally, given my family

00:57.360 --> 01:04.800
 history in the Soviet Union, in Russia, and in Ukraine. Today, the words Marxism, Socialism,

01:04.800 --> 01:11.680
 and Communism are used to attack and to divide, much more than to understand and to learn.

01:11.680 --> 01:19.760
 With this podcast, I seek the latter. I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx,

01:19.760 --> 01:24.800
 as well as their various implementations throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries.

01:25.520 --> 01:30.960
 And in general, we need to both steal man and to consider seriously the ideas we demonize,

01:31.840 --> 01:38.720
 and to challenge the ideas we dogmatically accept as true, even when doing so is unpleasant

01:38.720 --> 01:44.960
 and at times dangerous. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it,

01:44.960 --> 01:51.120
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Richard Wolff.

01:52.160 --> 01:57.920
 Let's start with a basic question, but maybe not so basic after all. What is Marxism?

01:57.920 --> 02:04.320
 What are the defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and political theory and ideology?

02:04.320 --> 02:09.200
 Richard Wolff Well, the simplest way to begin a definition would be to say it's the tradition

02:10.000 --> 02:18.880
 that takes its founding inspiration from the works of Karl Marx. But because

02:20.000 --> 02:28.240
 these ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did,

02:28.240 --> 02:40.240
 literally, it's 140 years since Marx died. And in that time, his ideas have become major types

02:40.240 --> 02:47.600
 of thinking in every country on the earth. If you know much about the great ideas of human history,

02:49.200 --> 02:56.800
 that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time.

02:56.800 --> 03:03.120
 Richard Wolff And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity,

03:03.840 --> 03:11.520
 is that the Marxian ideas interacted with very different cultural histories, religious histories

03:12.160 --> 03:19.200
 and economic conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently

03:19.200 --> 03:27.520
 in different places at different times. And therefore, Marxism as a kind of first flush definition

03:27.520 --> 03:36.720
 is the totality of all of these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For the first

03:37.600 --> 03:46.080
 roughly 40, 50 years, Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about capitalism.

03:46.080 --> 03:51.600
 Marks himself, that's all he really did. He never wrote a book about communism. He never wrote

03:51.600 --> 03:59.200
 a book really about socialism. Either his comments were occasional, fragmentary, dispersed.

03:59.760 --> 04:06.160
 What he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism. And that's what Marxism

04:06.160 --> 04:16.320
 was more or less in its first 40 or 50 years. The only qualification of what I just said

04:16.880 --> 04:24.240
 was something that happened in Paris for a few weeks. In 1871, there was a collapse of the

04:24.240 --> 04:31.760
 French government, consequent upon losing a war to Bismarck's Germany. And then the result was

04:31.760 --> 04:38.560
 something called the Paris Commune. The working class of Paris rose up, basically took over the

04:38.560 --> 04:46.400
 function of running the Parisian economy and the Parisian society. And Marx's people, people

04:46.400 --> 04:52.000
 influenced by Marx, were very active in that commune and the leadership of the commune.

04:52.560 --> 04:58.320
 And Marx wasn't that far away. He was in London. These things were happening in Paris. That's

04:58.320 --> 05:06.960
 an easy transport even then. And for a short time, very short, Marxism had a different

05:08.000 --> 05:16.480
 quality. In addition to being a critique of capitalism, it became a theory of how to organize

05:16.480 --> 05:24.400
 society differently. Before that had only been implicit. Now it became explicit. What is the

05:24.400 --> 05:31.280
 leadership of the Paris Commune going to do? And why? And in what order? In other words,

05:31.280 --> 05:38.960
 governing, organizing a society. But since it only lasted a few weeks, the French army regrouped.

05:39.760 --> 05:46.560
 And under the leadership of people who were very opposed to Marx, they marched back into Paris,

05:46.560 --> 05:54.080
 took over, killed a large number of the communards, as they were called, and deported them to

05:54.080 --> 05:57.920
 islands in the Pacific that were part of the French empire at the time.

05:59.520 --> 06:06.240
 The really big change happens in Russia in 1917. Now you have a group of Marxists,

06:06.240 --> 06:16.240
 Lenin Trotsky, all the rest, who are in this bizarre position to seize a moment. Once again,

06:16.240 --> 06:25.120
 a war, like in France, disorganizes the government, throws the government into a very bad reputation

06:25.120 --> 06:31.120
 because it is the government that loses World War I, has to withdraw, as you know,

06:31.760 --> 06:38.400
 Brest Litovsk and all of that, and the government collapses and the army revolts. And in that

06:38.400 --> 06:49.600
 situation, a very small political party, Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, splits under

06:49.600 --> 06:57.120
 the pressures of all of this into the Bolshevik and Menshevik divisions. Lenin Trotsky and the

06:57.120 --> 07:01.520
 others are in the Bolshevik division. And to make a long story short, he's in exile.

07:01.520 --> 07:09.680
 Lenin's position gets him deported because he says Russian workers should not be

07:10.640 --> 07:16.640
 killing German workers. I mean, this is a war of capitalists who are dividing the world up into

07:16.640 --> 07:23.680
 colonies, and Russian working people should not kill and should not die for such a thing.

07:23.680 --> 07:29.520
 As you can expect, they arrest him and they throw him out. Interestingly, in the United States,

07:29.520 --> 07:36.560
 the comparable leader at that time of the Socialist Party here, as you know, there was no Communist

07:36.560 --> 07:42.320
 Party at this point. That comes later. The head of the Socialist Party, a very important American

07:42.320 --> 07:49.840
 figure named Eugene Victor Debs, makes exactly the same argument to the Americans should not

07:49.840 --> 07:56.080
 fight in the war. He has nothing to do with Lenin. I don't even know if they knew of each other,

07:56.080 --> 08:01.120
 but he does it on his own. He gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States.

08:01.680 --> 08:06.880
 By the way, he runs for president from jail and does very well. Really, very well. Remarkable.

08:08.320 --> 08:15.920
 And he's the inspiration for Bernie Sanders, if you see the link, although he had much more courage

08:16.480 --> 08:20.880
 politically than Bernie has. That's really interesting. I'd love to return to that link maybe

08:20.880 --> 08:28.640
 later. History rhymes. Yes, the complicated story. Anyway, the importance in terms of Marxism is that

08:28.640 --> 08:38.240
 now this seizure of power by a group of Marxists, that is a group of people inspired by Marx,

08:38.240 --> 08:43.840
 developing what you might call a Russian, even though there were differences among the Russians

08:43.840 --> 08:52.560
 too, but a Russian interpretation, this now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism

08:53.120 --> 09:00.080
 into a plan at least of what you're going to do in the Soviet Union. And a lot of this was then

09:00.080 --> 09:06.720
 trial and error. Marx never laid any of this out. Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant if

09:06.720 --> 09:14.240
 he had because it was 50 years earlier in another country, etc. So what begins to happen, and you

09:14.240 --> 09:21.440
 can see how this happens then more later in China and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on, is that

09:21.440 --> 09:29.600
 you have kind of a bifurcation. Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of capitalism,

09:29.600 --> 09:37.840
 but another part of it becomes a set, and they differ from one to the other, a set of notions

09:38.560 --> 09:44.400
 of what an alternative post capitalist society ought to look like, how it ought to work,

09:45.120 --> 09:52.640
 and there's lots of disagreement about it, lots of confusion, and I would say that that's still

09:52.640 --> 09:59.920
 where it is. You have a tradition now that has these two major wings, critique of capitalism,

09:59.920 --> 10:06.320
 notion of the alternative, and then a variety of each of those, and that would be the framework in

10:06.320 --> 10:12.480
 which I would answer, that's what Marxism is about. Its basic idea, if you had to have one,

10:13.120 --> 10:18.800
 is that human society can do better than capitalism, and it ought to try.

10:18.800 --> 10:26.320
 And then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism. Fine. So we'll look at

10:26.320 --> 10:32.640
 the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back, what do you think Marx would say

10:32.640 --> 10:38.720
 if he just looked at the different implementations of the ideas of Marxism throughout the 20th

10:38.720 --> 10:48.080
 century, where his ideas that were implicit were made explicit? Would he shake his head?

10:48.080 --> 10:54.000
 Would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementations? How do you think he would analyze it?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.920
 Well, he had a great sense of humor. I don't know if he had a chance to take a look at his writing,

10:57.920 --> 11:03.200
 but he had an extraordinary sense of humor. So my guess is he would deploy his humor in

11:03.200 --> 11:09.040
 answering this question, too. He would say some of them are inspiring, some of the interpretations

11:09.040 --> 11:15.680
 of his work, and he's very pleased with those. Others are horrifying, and he wishes somehow he

11:15.680 --> 11:22.880
 could erase the connection between those things and the lineage they claim from him, which he would.

11:24.400 --> 11:29.920
 There's a German word. I don't know if you speak the other languages. There's a wonderful German

11:29.920 --> 11:36.880
 word called verzichte, and it's stronger than the word refuse. It's if you want to refuse something,

11:36.880 --> 11:46.560
 but with real strong emphasis. It's a German way of saying, I don't want to do that. And he would

11:46.560 --> 11:51.600
 talk then in philosophical terms, because remember, he was a student of philosophy.

11:51.600 --> 11:57.760
 He wrote his doctoral thesis on ancient Greek philosophy and all the rest. He would wax

11:57.760 --> 12:04.960
 philosophical and say that the ideas you put out are a little bit like having a child. You have a

12:04.960 --> 12:11.840
 lot of influence, but the child is his own or her own person and will find his or her own way.

12:11.840 --> 12:16.400
 And these ideas, once they're out there, go their own way.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.960
 And as you said, there's a particular way that this idea spread, the speed at which it spread

12:20.960 --> 12:28.160
 throughout the world, made it even less able to be stabilized and connected back to the origins

12:28.160 --> 12:34.000
 of where the idea came from. The only people who ever really tried that were the Russians,

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
 after the revolution, because they occupied a position for a while, not very long, but they

12:40.000 --> 12:45.520
 occupied a position for a while in which, I mean, it was exalted, right? There had been all these

12:45.520 --> 12:52.400
 people criticizing capitalism for a long time, even the Marxists ever since mid century. And these

12:52.400 --> 12:58.960
 were the first guys who pulled it off. They made it. And so that there was a kind of presumption

12:58.960 --> 13:07.280
 around the world. Their interpretation must be kind of the right one, because look, they did it.

13:07.280 --> 13:16.720
 And so for a while, they could enunciate their interpretation, and it came to be widely grasped

13:17.280 --> 13:23.520
 as something which, by the way, gets called in the literature, official Marxism. The very idea

13:23.520 --> 13:29.520
 that you would put that adjective in front of Marxism, or Soviet Marxism, or Russian Marxism,

13:29.520 --> 13:36.000
 there were these words that where the adjective was meant to somehow say, kind of, this is the

13:36.000 --> 13:41.920
 canon. You can depart from it, but this is the canon. Before the Russian Revolution, there was no

13:41.920 --> 13:52.160
 such thing. And by the 1960s, it was already, it was gone. But for a short time, 30, 40 years,

13:52.160 --> 14:00.880
 it was a kind of, and the irony is, particularly here in the United States, where the taboo against

14:00.880 --> 14:09.120
 Marxism kicks in right after World War II, is so total in this country that I, for example,

14:09.120 --> 14:17.360
 through most of my adult life, have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time simply explaining

14:17.360 --> 14:27.520
 to American audiences that the Marxism they take as canonical is that old Soviet Marxism,

14:27.520 --> 14:35.440
 which wasn't the canon before 1917 and hasn't been since at least the 1960s, but they don't know.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.800
 It's not that they're stupid and it's not that they're ignorant. It's that, well, the ignorance

14:40.800 --> 14:47.600
 may be, but I mean, it's not a mental problem. It's the taboo shut it down. And so all of the

14:47.600 --> 14:55.040
 reopening that in a way recaptures what went before and develops it in new direction, they just

14:55.040 --> 15:02.560
 don't know. Nevertheless, it's the serious attempt at making the implicit ideas explicit. The

15:02.560 --> 15:09.040
 Russians, the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century, made a serious attempt at saying,

15:09.040 --> 15:14.480
 okay, beyond the critique of capitalism, how do we actually build a system like this? And so in

15:14.480 --> 15:21.520
 that sense, not at a high level, but at a detailed level, it's interesting to look at those particular

15:22.320 --> 15:27.280
 schools maybe. Right, because for example, let me just take your point one step further,

15:27.280 --> 15:34.720
 you really cannot understand the Cuban revolution, the Chinese revolution, Vietnamese and the others,

15:34.720 --> 15:43.600
 because each of them is a kind of response, let's call it, to the way the Soviets did it.

15:43.600 --> 15:50.400
 Are you going to do it that way? Well, yes and no is the answer. This we will do that way,

15:50.400 --> 15:56.960
 but that we're not going to do. And the differences are huge, but you could find a thread, I can do

15:56.960 --> 16:05.520
 that for you if you want, in which all of them are in a way reacting to the originals. Yes, very

16:05.520 --> 16:10.640
 much so. Like maybe most of rock music is reacting to the Beatles and the Stones. That's something

16:10.640 --> 16:17.680
 like that. Can you speak to the unique elements of the various schools of that Soviet Marxism? So

16:17.680 --> 16:27.280
 we've got Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, maybe even let's expand out to Maoism. So maybe I could

16:27.280 --> 16:36.480
 speak to sort of Leninism and then please tell me if I'm saying dumb things. I think for Lenin,

16:36.480 --> 16:43.760
 there was an idea that there could be a small, so the Vanguard party, like a small controlling

16:43.760 --> 16:52.320
 entity that's wise and is able to do the central planning decisions. Then for Stalinism, one

16:52.320 --> 16:57.360
 interesting, so Stalin's implementation of all of this, one interesting characteristic is to

16:58.000 --> 17:04.960
 move away from the international aspect of the ideal of Marxism to make it all about

17:04.960 --> 17:15.600
 nationalism, the strength of nation. So Maoism is different in that it's focused on agriculture

17:15.600 --> 17:24.720
 and rural. Then Trotskyism, I don't know except that it's anti Stalin. I mean, I don't even know

17:24.720 --> 17:29.600
 if there's unique philosophical elements there. Anyway, can you maybe from those or something

17:29.600 --> 17:35.520
 else speak to different unique elements that are interesting to think about implementation

17:35.520 --> 17:43.680
 of Marxism in the real world? Probably the best way to get into this is to describe something that

17:43.680 --> 17:52.640
 happened in Marxism that then shapes the answer to your question. In the early days of Marxist

17:52.640 --> 18:00.160
 writings, and you know, his life spans the 19th century. He was born in 1818, dies in 1883,

18:00.160 --> 18:08.480
 so literally he lives the 19th century. To make things simple, you might look at the first half

18:08.480 --> 18:17.360
 of the first two thirds of his life as overwhelmingly gathering together the precursors to his own

18:17.360 --> 18:24.240
 work. Marx was unusually scholarly in the sense that partly because he didn't work a regular job

18:24.240 --> 18:29.840
 and partly because he was an exile in London, most of his adult life, he worked in the library.

18:29.840 --> 18:35.680
 I mean, he had a lot of time. He got subsidized a little bit by Engels, whose family were

18:35.680 --> 18:42.240
 manufacturers. And you might say the first half to two thirds of his life are about

18:42.240 --> 18:51.600
 the critique of capitalism. And that was what, in a broad sense, the audience for his work,

18:52.160 --> 18:58.720
 Western Europe more or less, was interested in. That's what they wanted. And he gave that to them.

18:58.720 --> 19:06.720
 He wasn't the only one, but he was very, very effective at it. By the last third of his life,

19:06.720 --> 19:17.040
 he and the other producers of a anti capitalist movement, people like the Chartists in England,

19:17.040 --> 19:25.840
 that's a whole other movement, the anarchists of various kinds, like Proudhon in France or

19:25.840 --> 19:32.880
 Kropotkin or Bakunin in Russia, and so on. You put all these together and there was a shift

19:32.880 --> 19:42.640
 in what the audience, let's call it a mixture of militant working class people on the one hand

19:43.200 --> 19:49.120
 and critical or radical intelligentsia on the other. They now wanted a different question.

19:49.120 --> 19:56.560
 They were persuaded by the analysis. They were agreeable that capitalism was a phase they would

19:56.560 --> 20:03.920
 like to do better than. And the question became, how do we do this? Not anymore, should we? Why

20:03.920 --> 20:09.840
 should we? Could we maybe fix capitalism? No, they had gotten to the point the system has to be

20:09.840 --> 20:16.000
 fundamentally changed. But they got, they didn't go, you might imagine, they didn't go and say,

20:16.000 --> 20:21.040
 well, what will that new system looks like? They didn't go that way. What they did was ask the

20:21.040 --> 20:30.000
 question, how could we get beyond capitalism? It seems so powerful. It seems to have captured

20:30.000 --> 20:37.680
 people's minds, people's daily lives and so on. And the focus of the conversation became,

20:38.240 --> 20:46.080
 this was already by the last third of the 19th century, the question of the agency, the mechanism

20:46.080 --> 20:52.560
 whereby we would get beyond. And again, make a long story short, the conversation focused

20:53.440 --> 21:00.320
 on seizing the government. See, before that, it wasn't that the government was not a major

21:00.320 --> 21:06.480
 interest. If you read Marx's capital, the great work of his maturity, three volumes,

21:06.480 --> 21:12.080
 there's almost nothing in the state. I mean, he mentions it, but he's interested in the details

21:12.080 --> 21:19.360
 of how capitalism works, factory by factory, store by store, office. What's the structure?

21:19.360 --> 21:24.480
 The government's secondary for him. But there's also humans within that capitalist system of,

21:24.480 --> 21:32.080
 there's the working class. Right. That's what he's interested in. Think of it almost mechanically

21:32.080 --> 21:37.280
 like the workplace. In the workplace, there are some people who do this and other people who do

21:37.280 --> 21:43.680
 that. And they accept this division of authority and they accept this division of what's going on

21:43.680 --> 21:50.240
 here, particularly because he believed that the core economic objective of capitalism was to

21:50.240 --> 21:57.120
 maximize something called profit, which his analysis located right there in the workings

21:57.120 --> 22:03.200
 of the enterprise. And the government was not the key factor here. And he was looking at ideas of

22:03.200 --> 22:11.440
 value. Yes. How much is the, how much value does the labor of the individual workers provide? And

22:11.440 --> 22:17.280
 that means how do we reward the workers in an ethical way? And so those are the questions of...

22:17.280 --> 22:22.800
 Right. Well, we'll get there. Yeah. Okay. But the government is not part of that picture.

22:22.800 --> 22:27.360
 That's right. Okay. So it's very significant that towards the end of the 19th century,

22:27.360 --> 22:34.720
 Marx is still alive when this begins, but it really gets going after he dies, is this debate

22:34.720 --> 22:41.840
 among Marxists about the role of the state. They all agree, nearly all of them, agree

22:42.400 --> 22:50.000
 that you have to get the state. The working class has to get the state because they see the state

22:50.000 --> 22:57.600
 as the ultimate guarantor of capitalism. When things get really out of hand, the capitalist

22:57.600 --> 23:04.880
 calls the police or he calls the army or both of them. And so the government is, in a sense,

23:04.880 --> 23:13.840
 this key institution captured in Marxist language by the bourgeoisie, by the other side, the

23:13.840 --> 23:22.160
 capitalists, and yet vulnerable because of suffrage. If suffrage is universal or nearly so,

23:22.720 --> 23:30.320
 if everybody gets a vote, which in a way capitalism brings to bear, part of its rejection of feudalism

23:30.320 --> 23:37.600
 in the French American Revolution, is to create a place where elected represented. So the

23:37.600 --> 23:45.440
 government being subject to suffrage creates the notion, aha, here's how we're going to,

23:45.440 --> 23:52.000
 we have to seize the state. And then that gets agreed upon, but there's a big split as to how

23:52.000 --> 24:00.400
 to do it. One side says, you go with the election, you mobilize the voter. That gets to be called

24:00.400 --> 24:08.560
 reformism within Marxism. And the other side is revolution. Don't do that. This system,

24:08.560 --> 24:15.520
 if I may quote Bernie again, is rigged. You can't get there. They've long ago learned how to

24:15.520 --> 24:23.280
 manipulate parliaments. They buy the politicians and all that. And therefore, revolution is going

24:23.280 --> 24:30.640
 to be the way to do it. Revolution gets a very big boost because the Russians, they did it that way.

24:31.200 --> 24:38.240
 They didn't do, I mean, they fought in the Duma in the parliament, but they didn't. And this focus

24:38.240 --> 24:46.560
 on the state, I would argue, goes way beyond what the debaters at the time, and if you're

24:46.560 --> 24:52.960
 interested in the great names, there was a great theorist of the role of the state

24:52.960 --> 24:59.680
 in a reformist strategy to get power in Germany named Edward Bernstein. Very important.

25:00.320 --> 25:08.720
 His opponents in Germany were Karl Kautzke and Rosa Luxemburg, two other huge figures in Marxism

25:08.720 --> 25:14.160
 at the time. And they wrote the articles that everybody reads, but it was a much broader

25:14.800 --> 25:17.120
 debate. And by the way, that debate still goes on.

25:17.120 --> 25:22.880
 So reformism versus revolution. And in terms of not all that different, I mean,

25:22.880 --> 25:26.240
 it's adjusted to history, but in terms of different.

25:26.240 --> 25:32.640
 Can you comment on where you lean in terms of the mechanism of progress,

25:33.440 --> 25:36.720
 reformation versus revolution? I'd rather tell you the historical story.

25:37.760 --> 25:44.160
 Over and over and over again, in most cases, the reformists have always won because revolution

25:44.160 --> 25:51.360
 is frightening, is scary, is dangerous. And so most of the time, when you get to the point

25:51.360 --> 25:56.480
 where it's even a relevant discussion, not an abstract thing for conferences, but a real

25:57.200 --> 26:03.760
 strategic issue, the reformists have won. I mean, and I'll give you an example from the

26:03.760 --> 26:11.280
 United States. In the Great Depression of the 1930s, you had an extraordinary shift to the

26:11.280 --> 26:17.040
 left in the United States, the greatest shift to the left in the country's history before or since.

26:17.040 --> 26:27.280
 Nothing like it. Suddenly, you created a vast left wing composed of the labor movement, which

26:27.280 --> 26:33.680
 went crazy in the 1930s. We organized more people into unions in the 1930s than at any time before

26:33.680 --> 26:41.200
 or any time since it is the explosion. And at the same time, the explosion of two socialist parties

26:41.200 --> 26:48.080
 and the Communist Party that became very powerful, and they all worked together, creating a very

26:48.080 --> 26:55.760
 powerful leftist presence in this country. They debated in a strategically real way reform or

26:55.760 --> 27:03.840
 revolution. The reformers were the union people by and large, and the communists were the revolutionaries

27:03.840 --> 27:09.280
 by and large because they were affiliated with the communist international, with Russia and all

27:09.280 --> 27:14.720
 of that. And in between, you might say that the two socialist parties, one that was Trotskyist

27:14.720 --> 27:21.680
 and Inspiration and the other one, more moderate Western European kind of socialism, and they had

27:21.680 --> 27:27.600
 this intense debate. And they ended up, the reformists won that debate. There was no revolution in

27:27.600 --> 27:36.720
 the 1930s here, but there was a reform that achieved unspeakably great successes, which is

27:36.720 --> 27:43.680
 why it was as strong and remains as strong as it does because it achieved in a few years in the 1930s,

27:43.680 --> 27:49.520
 starting around 1932, three social security in this country. We had never had that before.

27:49.520 --> 27:55.360
 That's the same one we have now. Unemployment insurance never existed before, which I have till

27:55.360 --> 28:02.160
 today. Minimum wage for the first time, still have that today. And a federal program of employment

28:02.160 --> 28:09.040
 that hired 15 million people. I mean, these were unspeakable gifts, if you like, to the working

28:09.040 --> 28:15.360
 class. That's the 30s and the 40s. 30s, not much in the 40s anymore, but in the 30s. And here's

28:15.360 --> 28:22.320
 the best part. It was paid for by taxes on corporations and the rich. So when people today

28:22.320 --> 28:27.520
 say, well, you can tax the government, the joke is I have to teach American history to Americans

28:27.520 --> 28:32.960
 because it has been erased from consciousness.

28:32.960 --> 28:38.480
 We'll return to that. But first, let's take a stroll back to the beginning of the 20th century

28:38.480 --> 28:43.920
 with the Russians. Right, with the Russians. So their interpretation goes like this.

28:47.040 --> 28:52.640
 Everybody was right. The state is crucial. We were right. We were the revolutionaries.

28:52.640 --> 29:01.040
 We seized the state here in Russia. Now we have the state and socialism is when the working class

29:01.760 --> 29:08.400
 captures the state, either by reform or revolution, and then uses its power over the state

29:08.400 --> 29:13.680
 to make the transition from capitalism to the better thing we're going toward.

29:15.840 --> 29:21.120
 And again, make a long story short in the interest of time. What happens, which is not

29:21.120 --> 29:29.040
 unusual in human history, is that the means becomes the end. In other words, Lenin, who's

29:29.040 --> 29:35.040
 crystal clear before he, you know, he doesn't live very long. He dies in 23. So he's only in power

29:35.040 --> 29:41.520
 from 17 to 22. By that time, he has his brain trouble and not 1923, by the way, not at age

29:41.520 --> 29:49.920
 23. 1923. Yeah, it's only there for four or five years. He's very clear, even says that I've done

29:49.920 --> 29:56.240
 work on, I've published, so I know this stuff. He says in a famous speech, let's not fool ourselves.

29:57.040 --> 30:02.800
 We have captured the state, but we don't have socialism. We have to create that. We have to

30:02.800 --> 30:11.040
 move towards that. With Stalin, you know, Lenin dies and there's a fight between Stalin and

30:11.040 --> 30:17.680
 Trotsky. Trotsky loses the fight. He's exiled. He goes to Mexico. Stalin is now alone in power,

30:17.680 --> 30:27.760
 does all the things he's famous or infamous for. And by the end of the 20s, Stalin makes a decision.

30:27.760 --> 30:34.080
 I mean, not that he makes it alone, but things have evolved in Russia so that they do the following.

30:34.080 --> 30:43.920
 They declare that they are socialism. In other words, socialism becomes when you capture the

30:43.920 --> 30:52.080
 state, not when the state capture has enabled you to do X, Y, Z, other things. No, no, the state

30:52.080 --> 30:59.840
 itself, once you have it, is socialism. So when a socialist captures the state, that's socialism.

30:59.840 --> 31:06.640
 Exactly. And that's exactly right. I feel like that's definitionally confusing.

31:06.640 --> 31:11.600
 Well, it shouldn't be, because I'll give you an example. If you go to many parts of the United

31:11.600 --> 31:17.680
 States today and you ask people, what's socialism? They'll tell you, they'll look you right in the

31:17.680 --> 31:24.640
 face and they'll say, the post office. And you know, when I first heard this as a young man,

31:24.640 --> 31:31.760
 you know what? The post office. It took me a while to understand the post office, Amtrak,

31:31.760 --> 31:39.280
 the Tennessee, all the examples in the United States where the government runs something.

31:39.280 --> 31:47.280
 This is socialism. See, capitalism is if the government doesn't run it. If a private

31:47.280 --> 31:53.680
 individual who's not a government official runs it, well, then it's capitalism. If the government

31:53.680 --> 32:00.640
 takes it, then it's socialism. So what is wrong with that reasoning? So the idea, I think...

32:01.680 --> 32:05.040
 There's nothing wrong with it. It's a way of looking at the world. It's just got nothing

32:05.040 --> 32:12.160
 to do with Marx. Well, there's Marx. There's Marxism. Let's try to pull this apart. So what role

32:14.560 --> 32:24.080
 does central planning have in Marxism? So Marxism is concerned with this class struggle,

32:25.440 --> 32:33.280
 with respecting the working class. Right. What is the connection between that struggle and

32:33.280 --> 32:38.160
 central planning that is often... Central planning is often associated with Marxism.

32:38.160 --> 32:42.080
 Right. So a centralized power doing... Russia did that.

32:42.080 --> 32:48.640
 Allocation. So that has to do with a very specific set of implementations initiated

32:48.640 --> 32:53.120
 by the Soviet Union. It has nothing to do with Marx. How else can you do... I don't think you can

32:53.120 --> 33:00.400
 find anywhere in Marxist writing anything about central planning or any other kind of planning.

33:00.400 --> 33:11.520
 Again, fundamentally, then, Marx's work has to do with factories, with workers, with the bourgeoisie,

33:12.560 --> 33:17.120
 and the exploitation of the working class. Exactly.

33:17.120 --> 33:21.600
 But you still have to take that leap. What is beyond capitalism?

33:21.600 --> 33:25.680
 Right. So maybe we should turn to that, focus on that.

33:25.680 --> 33:32.480
 Okay. Yes. We've already looked historically at several attempts to go beyond capitalism.

33:33.040 --> 33:37.280
 How else can we go beyond capitalism? Right. Let me push it a little further.

33:37.280 --> 33:43.520
 They didn't succeed in my judgment as a Marxist, and I'm now going to tell you why they didn't

33:43.520 --> 33:48.480
 succeed because they didn't understand as well as they could have or should have

33:49.120 --> 33:54.080
 what Marxism was trying to do. I think I would have been like them if I had lived at their time

33:54.080 --> 33:59.520
 under their circumstances. This is not a critique of them, but it's a different way of understanding

33:59.520 --> 34:06.320
 what's going on. All right. So give you an example. Most of my adult life, I have taught

34:06.320 --> 34:11.920
 Marxian economics. I'm a professor of economics. I've been that all my life.

34:12.960 --> 34:19.920
 I'm a graduate of American universities. As it happens, I'm a graduate of what in this country

34:19.920 --> 34:27.840
 passes for its best universities. It's another conversation you and I can have. So I went to

34:27.840 --> 34:34.240
 Harvard, then I went to Stanford, and I finished the Yale. I'm like a poster boy for elite education.

34:34.960 --> 34:40.880
 They tried very hard. By the way, I spent 10 years of my life in the Ivy League.

34:40.880 --> 34:49.120
 20 semesters, one after the other, no break. In those 20 semesters, 19 of them never mentioned

34:49.120 --> 34:57.440
 a word about Marxism. That is, no critique of capitalism was offered to me ever with one

34:57.440 --> 35:03.760
 except one professor in Stanford in the one semester I studied with him. He gave me plenty

35:03.760 --> 35:08.960
 to read, but nobody else. So that's really interesting. You've mentioned that in the past,

35:08.960 --> 35:17.680
 and that's very true, which makes you a very interesting figure to hold your ground intellectually

35:17.680 --> 35:23.280
 through this idea space where just people don't really even talk about it.

35:24.240 --> 35:28.640
 Perhaps we can discuss historically why that is, but nevertheless, that's the case. So

35:29.760 --> 35:36.720
 Marxian economics, did Karl Marx come up in conversation as a kind of dismissal?

35:37.520 --> 35:42.800
 The best example, yeah, he came up only as an object of dismissal. For giving an example,

35:42.800 --> 35:48.320
 the major textbook in economics that I was taught with, and that was for many years,

35:48.320 --> 35:55.840
 the canonical book, it isn't quite anymore, was a book authored by a professor of economics at MIT,

35:55.840 --> 36:01.760
 named Paul Samuelson, and people who kind of, you know, a whole generation or two were trained

36:01.760 --> 36:09.920
 on his textbook. If you open the cover of his textbook, he has a tree, and the tree is Adam

36:09.920 --> 36:15.920
 Smith and David Ricardo at the root, and then the different branches of it. He's trying to give

36:15.920 --> 36:22.960
 you an idea as a student of how the thing developed, and it's a tree, and everybody on it is a bourgeois.

36:23.600 --> 36:29.360
 And then there's this one little branch that goes off like this and sort of starts heading back down.

36:29.360 --> 36:35.120
 That's Karl Marx. In other words, he had to have it complete because he's not a complete faker,

36:35.120 --> 36:43.120
 but beyond that, no, there was no. Nothing in the book gives you two paragraphs of an approach.

36:43.920 --> 36:48.560
 But that's Cold War. I mean, that's really, that's really neither here to that. That's the

36:48.560 --> 36:53.040
 craziness. Yeah, that's the Cold War in this country. My professors were afraid. Anyway,

36:53.040 --> 37:00.880
 let me get to the core of it, what I think will help. Marx was interested in the relationship

37:00.880 --> 37:07.120
 of people in the process of production, that he's interested in the factory, the office, the store.

37:07.120 --> 37:15.360
 What goes on, and by that he means what are the relationships among the people that come together

37:15.360 --> 37:26.720
 in a workplace? And what he analyzes is that there is something going on there that has not been

37:26.720 --> 37:35.040
 adequately understood and that has not been adequately addressed as an object needing

37:35.040 --> 37:42.880
 transformation. And what does he mean? The answer is exploitation, which he defines mathematically

37:42.880 --> 37:52.240
 in the following way. Whenever in a society, any society, you organize people, adults, not the

37:52.240 --> 37:59.680
 children, not the sick, but you know, healthy adults. In the following way, a big block of them,

37:59.680 --> 38:06.320
 a clear majority, work. That is, they use their brains and their muscles to transform nature.

38:06.320 --> 38:13.200
 A tree into a chair, a sheep into a woolen sweater, whatever. In every human community,

38:13.200 --> 38:20.960
 Marx argues, there are the people who do that work, but they always produce more chairs,

38:20.960 --> 38:27.200
 more sweaters, more hamburgers than they themselves consume, whatever their standard of living.

38:27.200 --> 38:32.080
 They don't have to be low, it could be medium, it could be high, but they always produce more

38:32.720 --> 38:39.600
 than they themselves consume. That more, by the way, Marx, when he writes this, uses the German

38:39.600 --> 38:48.880
 word mehr, which is the English equivalent of more. It's the more. That more got badly translated

38:48.880 --> 38:56.480
 into the word surplus. Shouldn't it have been? But it was. By the way, by German and English

38:56.480 --> 39:01.680
 people doing the translations. What's the difference between more and surplus? Is there a nuanced?

39:01.680 --> 39:08.720
 Yeah, because surplus has a notion of its discretionary, its sort of extra. He's not

39:08.720 --> 39:13.680
 taking, he's not making a judgment that it's extra. It's a simple math equation. Yes, very simple.

39:13.680 --> 39:22.080
 One minus the other. Yes. X minus Y. X is the total output. Y is the consumption

39:22.080 --> 39:29.680
 by the producer. Therefore, X minus Y equals S, the surplus. Exactly. Exactly. Now, Marx argues,

39:31.440 --> 39:38.400
 the minute you understand this, you will ask the following question. Who gets the surplus?

39:38.400 --> 39:45.760
 Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by those who made it?

39:46.480 --> 39:54.080
 And Marx's answer is, therein lies one of the great shapers of any society. How is that organized?

39:54.080 --> 40:02.880
 For example, who gets it? What are they asked, if anything, to do with it in exchange for getting

40:02.880 --> 40:08.560
 it? What's their social role? For example, here we go now. If you get this and you get the core of

40:08.560 --> 40:17.280
 it anyway. And I don't charge much. The workers themselves could get it. Weston lawyers. That's

40:17.280 --> 40:24.880
 right. The workers themselves could get it. That's the closest Marx comes to a definition of communism.

40:24.880 --> 40:34.560
 Communism would be if the workers who produce the surplus together decide what to do with it.

40:35.120 --> 40:39.440
 So this has to do not just with who gets it, but more importantly,

40:39.440 --> 40:44.720
 who gets to decide who gets it? Well, who gets it and who gets to decide what to do with it?

40:44.720 --> 40:49.680
 Right. Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it. So,

40:49.680 --> 40:58.560
 the logic of the word sequence, Marx uses the word appropriated. In other words,

40:58.560 --> 41:05.040
 whose property, who gets to decide, if you like, what happens? All that property ever meant

41:05.040 --> 41:10.000
 is who gets to decide and who's excluded. That's a clean definition of communism.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.880
 Right. And that's it. By the way, it's not just clean. It's the only one.

41:14.880 --> 41:19.360
 So what's, can we just linger on the definition of exploitation in that context?

41:20.160 --> 41:27.680
 Easy. It becomes very easy. Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that's produced

41:27.680 --> 41:34.480
 is taken and distributed by people other than those who produced it. Slaves produce a surplus

41:34.480 --> 41:42.000
 which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the Lord gets. Employees produce a surplus

41:42.000 --> 41:52.960
 which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative class structures because one class

41:52.960 --> 42:02.480
 produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another group of people, not the ones who produced

42:02.480 --> 42:10.320
 it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger, resentment, and all of the problems

42:10.320 --> 42:18.240
 you can lump under the heading, class struggle. I use a metaphor, simple metaphorical story.

42:18.240 --> 42:23.440
 You have two children, let's assume, and you take them to Central Park a few blocks from here.

42:23.440 --> 42:29.440
 It's a nice day and the children are playing and in comes one of those men with an ice cream truck

42:29.440 --> 42:35.280
 comes by, ding a ling a ling a ling. Your children see the ice cream. Daddy, get me an ice cream.

42:35.280 --> 42:41.520
 So you walk over, you take some money and you get two ice cream cones and you give them to one of the

42:41.520 --> 42:49.040
 children. The other one begins to scream and yell and how? Obviously. What's the issue? And you

42:49.040 --> 42:55.920
 realize you've just made a terrible mistake. So you order the one you gave the two ice cream cones to

42:55.920 --> 43:02.000
 give one of those to your sister or your brother or whatever it is. And that's how you solve the

43:02.000 --> 43:08.880
 problem. Until a psychologist comes along and says, you know, you didn't fix it by what you

43:08.880 --> 43:16.160
 just did. You should never have done that in the first place. My response, though you understand,

43:17.040 --> 43:24.400
 all of the efforts to deal with inequality in economic, political, cultural, these are all

43:25.520 --> 43:30.320
 giving the ice cream cone back to the kid you should, you should never do this in the first

43:30.320 --> 43:35.520
 place. Reallocation of resources creates bitterness and populace. Look at our, we've,

43:35.520 --> 43:40.640
 this country is tearing itself apart now in a way that I have never seen in my life and I've lived

43:40.640 --> 43:46.960
 here all my life and I've worked here all my life. It's tearing itself apart and it's tearing itself

43:46.960 --> 43:55.200
 apart basically over the re division, the redistribution of wealth, having so badly

43:55.200 --> 44:01.600
 distributed in the first, but that's all in Marx. And notice, as I explained to you what is going

44:01.600 --> 44:07.680
 on in this tension filled production scene in the office, the factory, the store, I don't have to

44:07.680 --> 44:12.720
 say a word about the government. I'm not interested in the government. The government's really a very

44:12.720 --> 44:19.840
 secondary matter to this core question. And here comes the big point. If you make a revolution

44:19.840 --> 44:29.280
 and all you do is remove the private exploiter and substitute a government official without

44:29.280 --> 44:35.360
 changing the relationship, you know, you can call yourself a Marxist all day long, but you're not

44:35.360 --> 44:42.480
 getting the point of the Marxism. The point was not who the exploiter is, but the exploitation

44:42.480 --> 44:48.640
 per se. You got to change the organization of the workplace so there isn't a group that

44:48.640 --> 44:55.120
 makes all the decisions and gets the surplus vis a vis another one that produces it. If you do that,

44:55.120 --> 45:01.760
 you will destroy the whole project. Not only will you not achieve what you set out to get,

45:01.760 --> 45:08.720
 but you'll so misunderstand it that the Germans again have a phrase, it's get chief. It goes

45:08.720 --> 45:16.560
 crooked. It doesn't go right. The project gets off the rails because it can't understand

45:16.560 --> 45:21.040
 either what its objective should have been and therefore it doesn't understand how and why it's

45:21.040 --> 45:26.720
 missing its objective. It just knows that this is not what it had hoped for. I mean, there's a

45:26.720 --> 45:36.400
 lot of fascinating questions here. So one is to what degree, so there's human nature, to what degree

45:37.280 --> 45:44.800
 this communism, a lack of exploitation of the working class naturally emerge. If you leave

45:44.800 --> 45:50.800
 two people together in a room and come back a year later, if you leave five people together in a

45:50.800 --> 45:57.040
 room, if you leave a hundred people and a thousand people, it seems that humans form hierarchies

45:58.560 --> 46:06.000
 naturally. So the clever, the charismatic, the sexy, the muscular, the powerful, however you

46:06.000 --> 46:16.000
 define that, start becoming a leader and start to do maybe exploitation in a non negative sense,

46:16.000 --> 46:23.040
 a more generic sense, starts to become an employer, not in a capitalist sense, but just as a human.

46:23.040 --> 46:27.920
 Here, you go do this and in exchange, I will give you this, just becomes the leadership role.

46:29.120 --> 46:35.600
 So the question is, yes, okay, it would be nice. The idea of communism would be nice

46:35.600 --> 46:40.640
 to not steal from the world. It's nice in theory, but it doesn't work in practice

46:40.640 --> 46:46.960
 because of human nature. Because of human nature. That's, thank you. So what can we say about

46:46.960 --> 46:53.680
 leveraging human nature to achieve some of these ends? There's so many ways of responding in no

46:53.680 --> 47:01.600
 particular order. Here are some of them. The history of the human race, as best I can tell,

47:01.600 --> 47:14.240
 is a history in which a succession of social forms, forms of society, arise and as they do,

47:15.120 --> 47:22.800
 they rule out some kinds of human behavior on the grounds that they are socially disruptive

47:22.800 --> 47:31.360
 and unacceptable. The argument isn't really then, is there a need or an instinct? Is there some human

47:31.360 --> 47:38.320
 nature that makes people want to do this? Well, whatever that is, this has to be repressed or

47:38.320 --> 47:45.040
 else we don't have a society. You know, and Freud helps us to understand that that repression

47:45.040 --> 47:51.040
 is going on all the time and it has consequences. It's not a finished project. You repress it.

47:51.040 --> 47:56.880
 It's gone. It doesn't work like that. So for example, when you get a bunch of people together

47:56.880 --> 48:03.920
 at some point, they may develop animosities towards one another that lead them to want the

48:03.920 --> 48:11.440
 other person or persons to disappear, to be dead, to be gone. But we don't permit you to do that.

48:12.320 --> 48:21.600
 We just don't. Every economic system that has ever existed has included people who defend it

48:21.600 --> 48:30.800
 on the grounds that it is the only system consistent with human nature and that every effort to go

48:30.800 --> 48:39.440
 beyond it has to fail because it contradicts human nature. I can show you endless documents of every

48:39.440 --> 48:46.320
 tribal society I've ever studied, every anthropological community that has ever been studied, slavery

48:46.320 --> 48:52.400
 wherever it's existed, I can show you endless documents in which the defenders of those systems,

48:52.400 --> 49:00.880
 not all of them of course, but many defenders used that argument to naturalize a system is a way

49:00.880 --> 49:08.160
 to hold on to it, to prevent it from going, to counter the argument that every system is born,

49:08.160 --> 49:16.400
 every system evolves, and then every system dies. And therefore capitalism since it was born, and

49:16.400 --> 49:21.520
 since it's been developing, we all know what the next stage of capitalism is.

49:21.520 --> 49:26.800
 Looking in fur. The burden is on the people who think it isn't going to die.

49:26.800 --> 49:31.200
 Okay, so it doesn't mean they're wrong, but what you're saying is if we look at history,

49:31.920 --> 49:37.040
 you're deeply suspicious of the argument this is going against human nature because we keep using

49:37.040 --> 49:42.720
 that for basically everything including toxic relationship, toxic systems, destructive systems.

49:43.360 --> 49:51.600
 That said, well, let me just ask a million different questions. So one, what about the argument that

49:51.600 --> 50:02.160
 sort of the employer, the capitalist takes on risk? So versus the employee who's just there doing

50:02.160 --> 50:10.560
 the labor, the capitalist is actually putting up a lot of risk. Are they not in sort of

50:10.560 --> 50:15.680
 aggregating this organization and taking this giant effort, hiring a lot of people? Aren't

50:15.680 --> 50:18.880
 they taking on risk that this is going to be a giant failure?

50:18.880 --> 50:26.480
 So first of all, there's risk almost in everything you undertake. Any project that begins now and

50:26.480 --> 50:32.560
 ends in the future takes a risk that between now and that future something's going to happen that

50:32.560 --> 50:39.520
 makes it not work out. I mean, I got into a cab before I came here today in order to do this

50:39.520 --> 50:45.200
 with you. I took a risk. The cab could have been in an accident. The lightning could have hit us.

50:45.200 --> 50:47.920
 A bear could have eaten my left foot. Who the hell knows?

50:47.920 --> 50:50.560
 But shouldn't I reward you for the risk you took?

50:50.560 --> 50:55.840
 No, hold it a second. Let's do this step by step. So everybody's taking a risk. I always

50:55.840 --> 51:01.760
 found it wonderful. You talk about risk and then you imagine it's only some of us who take a risk.

51:02.480 --> 51:10.960
 Let's go with the worker with the capitalist. That worker, he moved his family from Michigan

51:10.960 --> 51:18.640
 to Pennsylvania to take that job. He made a decision to have children. They are teenagers.

51:18.640 --> 51:23.920
 They're now in school at a time when their friendships are crucial to their development.

51:23.920 --> 51:29.840
 You're going to yank them out of the school because his job is gone. He took an enormous risk

51:30.960 --> 51:37.920
 to do that job every day, to forestall all the other things he could have done.

51:37.920 --> 51:45.120
 He was taking a risk that this job would be here tomorrow, next month, next year. He bought a house

51:45.120 --> 51:50.720
 which Americans only do with mortgages, which means he's now stuck. He has to make a monthly

51:50.720 --> 51:58.640
 payment. If you make a mistake, you capitalist, he's the one who's going to... You're a capitalist.

51:58.640 --> 52:03.920
 You got a lot of money. Otherwise, you wouldn't be in that position. You've got a cushion. He

52:03.920 --> 52:09.520
 doesn't. If you investigate, you'll see that in every business I've ever been in. I've been

52:09.520 --> 52:12.960
 involved in a lot of them. So you think it's possible to actually measure risk or as your

52:12.960 --> 52:18.080
 basic argument is there's risk involved in a lot of both the working class in the bourgeoisie,

52:18.080 --> 52:23.040
 the capitalist, and it's very difficult. And the worker would never come and say,

52:23.760 --> 52:31.680
 because he's been taught right, I want this payment, a wage for the work I do,

52:32.560 --> 52:39.200
 and I want this payment for the risk I take. Well, there's some level of communication

52:39.200 --> 52:44.640
 like that. You have acknowledgement of dangerous jobs, but that's probably built into the salary,

52:44.640 --> 52:49.840
 all those kinds of things. But you're not incorporating the full spectrum of risk.

52:50.720 --> 52:57.120
 You don't believe that. This country is now being literally transformed from below by an

52:57.120 --> 53:04.000
 army of workers who work at Amazon, fast food joints. You know what their complaint is? It's

53:04.000 --> 53:12.720
 killing us. We get paid shit and it's killing us. There is no relationship except in the minds of

53:12.720 --> 53:19.280
 the defenders of capitalism, between the ugliness, the difficulty, the danger of labor on the one

53:19.280 --> 53:25.360
 hand and the wage. Let me give you just a couple of examples. This is my job. This is my life,

53:25.360 --> 53:33.520
 what I do. The median income of a childcare worker in the United States right now as we speak

53:33.520 --> 53:45.440
 is $11.22 an hour, median. So 50% make less, 50% make more. The median income for a car park

53:45.440 --> 53:53.120
 attendant is several dollars per hour higher than that. What does the car park attendant do?

53:53.120 --> 53:58.800
 He stares at your car for many hours to make sure that nobody comes and grabs it.

53:58.800 --> 54:07.680
 Maybe he parks it and moves it around to get it in and out. By any measure that I know of that

54:07.680 --> 54:14.880
 makes any rational sense, being in charge of toddlers, two, three, four year olds who are at

54:14.880 --> 54:22.640
 the key moment of mental formation the first five years, to give that a lower salary than you give

54:22.640 --> 54:30.000
 the guy who watches your car. Come on, I know how to explain it. Gender explained, all kinds of

54:30.000 --> 54:37.040
 issues. The car park people are males and the childcare people are females and that in our

54:37.040 --> 54:42.880
 culture is a very big marker of what, but the one who said only the economics professor,

54:43.760 --> 54:49.120
 nobody else, says this stuff because in economics, I don't know if you were familiar with our

54:49.120 --> 54:57.280
 profession, but we have something which we call marginal product. This is a fantasy. I was a

54:57.280 --> 55:03.680
 mathematician. Before I became an economist, I loved mathematics. I specialized in mathematics.

55:03.680 --> 55:10.560
 So I know mathematics pretty well. What economists do is silly, is childish, but they think it's

55:10.560 --> 55:21.920
 mathematics. But think for a minute what it means to suggest that you can identify the marginal

55:21.920 --> 55:28.640
 product of a factor of production, like a worker. In the textbook, when it's taught,

55:28.640 --> 55:33.440
 I've taught this stuff. I hold my nose, but I teach it. Then I explain to students,

55:33.440 --> 55:37.040
 what I've just taught you is horseshit, but first I teach it.

55:37.040 --> 55:42.080
 What is the marginal product if it might be useful to say? The notion is, if you take away

55:42.080 --> 55:49.440
 one worker right now from the pile, what will be the diminution of the output? That's the marginal

55:49.440 --> 55:58.480
 product of that worker. The amount of the output that diminishes the output of the raw product.

56:00.160 --> 56:04.320
 Usually in real terms, so physical, not the value. You could do a value,

56:04.320 --> 56:09.200
 but it's really more the physical you're at. I mean, there is a transformation thing. I'd love

56:09.200 --> 56:15.840
 to talk to you about value. It's so interesting. I'd be glad to talk to you about value and price

56:15.840 --> 56:23.040
 and all of that, but I just want to get to that. Hegel, who is Marx's teacher, has a famous line.

56:23.680 --> 56:30.400
 You can't step in this in the same river twice. The argument is, you and the river have changed

56:30.400 --> 56:34.560
 between the first and the second time, so it's a different you and it's a different river.

56:34.560 --> 56:39.440
 You can choose not to pay attention to that. You can't claim you're not doing that.

56:39.440 --> 56:44.960
 You can't claim that you can actually do that because you can't. There is no way to do that.

56:44.960 --> 56:51.440
 So the meaning that you can't just remove a worker and have a clean mathematical calculation of the

56:51.440 --> 56:55.440
 effect that it has on the output? That's right, because too many other things are going on,

56:55.440 --> 57:02.480
 too many things are changing and you cannot assume, much as you want to, that the outcome

57:02.480 --> 57:09.360
 on the output side is uniquely determined by the change you made on the input side.

57:09.360 --> 57:14.080
 You can't do that. Even in the average, it's not going to work out.

57:14.080 --> 57:20.640
 You can take, look, mathematics is full of abstractions. You can say, as we do in economics,

57:20.640 --> 57:26.160
 Keteris Paribus, everything else held constant, but you have to know what you just did.

57:26.160 --> 57:30.160
 You held everything. You know why you do that? Because you can't do that in the real world.

57:30.160 --> 57:36.400
 That's not possible. You better account for that. Otherwise, you're mistaking the abstraction

57:36.400 --> 57:40.880
 from the messy reality you abstracted from to get the abstraction.

57:42.000 --> 57:47.680
 As a quick tangent, if we somehow went through a thought experiment or an actual experiment of

57:47.680 --> 57:52.080
 removing every single economist from the world, would we better off or worse off?

57:52.080 --> 57:57.920
 Much better off. Okay. Economics, and I'm one. I'm talking about myself.

57:58.720 --> 58:01.040
 See, economics got... We're going to ship all the

58:01.040 --> 58:03.840
 economists to Mars and see how the world works off.

58:03.840 --> 58:07.120
 No, but the serious part of this is that economics,

58:09.200 --> 58:13.840
 you know, it's really about capitalism. Economics as a discipline is born with

58:13.840 --> 58:18.080
 capital. There was no such thing. When I teach, I teach courses at the university,

58:18.080 --> 58:23.920
 for example, called History of Economic Thought, right? And I begin the students with Aristotle

58:23.920 --> 58:29.520
 and Plato. And I say, you know, they talked about really interesting things, but they never

58:29.520 --> 58:37.360
 called it economics. There was no... It made no sense to people to abstract something as

58:37.360 --> 58:44.400
 central to daily life as economics broadly defined. It made no sense. That's a creation

58:44.400 --> 58:50.400
 much, much later. That's capitalism that did that, created the feeling. So when I give them

58:50.400 --> 58:55.520
 Plato and Aristotle, I have to give them particular passages. By the way, footnote,

58:55.520 --> 59:01.440
 because your audience would like it. Plato and Aristotle talked about markets because they lived

59:01.440 --> 59:08.720
 at a time in ancient Greece when market relations were beginning to intrude upon these societies.

59:09.280 --> 59:15.040
 So they were both interested in this phenomena, that we're not just producing goods and then

59:15.040 --> 59:20.080
 distributing among us. We're doing it in a quid pro quo. You know, I'll give you three oranges,

59:20.080 --> 59:27.280
 you give me two shirts, a market exchange. And both Aristotle and Plato hated markets,

59:27.280 --> 59:34.640
 denounced them, and for the same reason, they destroy social cohesion. They destroy community.

59:34.640 --> 59:39.840
 They make some people rich and other people poor, and they set us against each other, and it's

59:39.840 --> 59:46.160
 terrible. And that's what they agreed on that. Here's what they disagreed on. One of them said,

59:46.160 --> 59:52.800
 okay, there can be no markets. That was Plato. Aristotle comes back and says, no, no, no, no,

59:52.800 --> 1:00:00.000
 no, too late for that. The disruption caused in society by getting rid of this institution that

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:07.840
 has crawled in amongst us would be too devastating. So we can't do that. But what we can do is

1:00:07.840 --> 1:00:15.440
 control it, regulate it, get from the market what it does reasonably well, and prevent it

1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:18.800
 from doing the destructive things it does so badly.

1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:25.200
 So the fundamentally, the destructive thing of a market is just the engine of capitalism. So

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:34.080
 it creates exploitation of the worker. It facilitates it, and it is an institution

1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:40.880
 that Plato and Aristotle feel is a terrible danger to community. Which, by the way,

1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:47.040
 is a way of thinking about it that exists right now all over the world. Look, the medieval Catholic

1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:57.760
 church had a doctrine, the prohibition of usury. And this was that God said, if there's a person

1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:04.160
 who needs to borrow from you, then that's a person in need. And the good Christian thing to do

1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:12.560
 is to help him. To demand an interest payment rather than to help your fellow man is,

1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:20.480
 God hates you for that. That's a sin. Jesus is crying all the way to wherever it is he goes.

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:26.560
 But would Jesus be crying when you try to scale that system? So that has to do with the

1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:35.520
 intimate human interaction. The idea of markets is you're able to create a system that involves

1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:45.760
 thousands, millions of humans. And there'd be some level of safe, self regulating fairness.

1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:52.160
 There might be, but it's hard to imagine that charging interest would be the way to do that.

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:56.000
 I wonder what, so I guess... Suppose you were interested in having,

1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:02.480
 suppose you took us your problem, we have a set of funds that can be loaned out.

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:11.120
 People don't want to consume it, they're ready to lend it. Okay. To whom should they lend it?

1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:16.480
 Well, we could say in our society, we're going to run this the way professors,

1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:24.400
 in institutions like MIT, work this. They write up a project. They send the project

1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:31.680
 into some government office where it is looked at against other projects. And this office in

1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:38.560
 the government decides, we're going to fund this one and that one because they're more needed in

1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:44.240
 our society. We are in greater need of solving this problem than that problem. And so we're

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:49.440
 going to lend money to people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend

1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:55.440
 over here because we're going to, but instead what we do is who can pay the highest interest rate.

1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:02.720
 Whoa, what, what, what do you do it? Why, what ethics would justify you do it? It's like a

1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:08.720
 market in general. Something is in shortage. All markets are about how to handle shortage.

1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:14.640
 That's one basic way to understand it. And so if the demand is greater than the supply,

1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:20.720
 which is all the word shortage means, has no other meaning. If the demand is greater than the supply,

1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:27.040
 okay, now you've got a problem. You can't satisfy all the demanders because you don't have enough

1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:33.280
 supply. You have a shortage. Okay, now how are you going to do it? In a market, you allow people

1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:40.080
 who have a lot of money to bid up the price of whatever's short and that solves your problem

1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:45.600
 because as the price goes up, the poor people can't, they drop out. They can't buy the thing

1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:51.360
 at the exalted price. So you've got a way of distributing the shortage. It goes to the people

1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:58.560
 with the most money. At this point, most human beings confronted with this explanation of a

1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:05.840
 market would turn against it because it contradicts their Christian, Judaic, Islamic, all of them

1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:11.920
 would say, what? You know what that means? It means that a rich person can get the scarce milk

1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:17.040
 and give it to their cat while the poor person has no milk for their five children.

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:23.440
 There it is. Do you want to market? Why? Over the fundamental thing that seems unfair,

1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:30.560
 there's the resulting inequality now. Or death. Or death. Well, that's the ultimate inequality.

1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:36.480
 Yes, it is. What about, and we're going to jump around from the philosophical, from the economics,

1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:44.800
 to the sort of debate type of thing. What about sort of the lifting ties raise all boats?

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:53.360
 Meaning, if we look at the 20th century, a lot of people, maybe you disagree with this,

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:59.680
 but they attribute a lot of the innovation and the average improvement in the quality of life

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:07.840
 to capitalism, to inventions and innovation, to engineering and science developments

1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:17.360
 that resulted from competition and all those kinds of forces. So not looking at the individual

1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:24.800
 unfairness of exploitation as it's specifically defined, but just observing historically.

1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:29.360
 Looking at the 20th century, we came up with a lot of cool stuff that seemed to have made life easier

1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:36.960
 and better on average. What do you say to that? I have several responses to that,

1:05:37.760 --> 1:05:45.280
 but I do disagree pretty fundamentally with what's going on there. But let me give you the

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:52.000
 argument so that you can hear them and then you can evaluate them as can anybody who's listening

1:05:52.000 --> 1:06:01.440
 or watching. Marx was a student of Hegel and one of Hegel's central arguments was that everything

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:09.840
 that exists, exists, quote, in the contradiction. In simple English, there's a good and bad side,

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:15.520
 if you like, to everything. And you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition and start

1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:20.480
 looking for the good things that are the other side of the bad ones and the bad things that are

1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:27.120
 the other side of the good one, et cetera. The dialectic. Yes, exactly. And Marx, very attentive

1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:34.320
 to that, explicitly agrees with this on many occasions and applies it, of course, to the

1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:41.600
 central object of his research, capitalism. So this is not a simple minded fellow who's telling

1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:47.040
 you all the bad things about capitalism as if there were nothing that this system achieved

1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:54.560
 or accomplished. And one of the things he celebrates a lot is the technological dynamism

1:06:54.560 --> 1:07:01.360
 of the system, which Marx takes to be profound because, you know, he lived at the time when

1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:08.800
 major breakthroughs in textile technology and mining and chemistry and so on were achieved.

1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:17.920
 But as to the notion that capitalism is therefore responsible for the improvement

1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:22.400
 in the quality or the standard of living of the mass of people,

1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:31.520
 Marx now comes back and says, oh, wait a minute here. Number one, capitalism as a system

1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:42.080
 has been mostly represented by capitalists, which makes a certain sense. And those capitalists with

1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:50.080
 very few exceptions, some but very few, have fought against every effort to improve the

1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:57.200
 lives of the mass of people. The goal of a capitalist is to minimize labor costs. What

1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:04.400
 that means is replace a worker with a machine, move the production from expensive U.S. to cheap

1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:10.800
 China, bring in desperate immigrants from other parts of the world because they will work for

1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:16.640
 less money than the folks that you have here at home. Every measure to help the standard of living

1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:24.720
 of American workers had to be fought for for decades over the opposition of capitalists

1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:30.800
 from the beginning to right now. The reason we have a minimum wage, which was past 19,

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:36.960
 middle of the 1930s, when it was proposed, it was blocked by capitalists. They got together,

1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:44.720
 they don't want, and today, just a factoid for you. The last time the minimum wage was raised

1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:51.680
 in the United States, federal minimum wage, was in 2009 when it was set at the lofty sum

1:08:51.680 --> 1:09:01.840
 of $7.25 an hour, which you cannot live on. Over the last 12 years or so, whatever it is,

1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:08.640
 not 11, 12, 13 years since then, we have had an increase in the price level in this country

1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:15.360
 every year, and in the last year, 8.5%. During that time that the prices went up,

1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:24.720
 the minimum wage was never raised. What? This is a time of stock market boom, of growing inequality.

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:38.480
 The nerve of the defender of capitalists who wants now to get credit for the improvement

1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:42.480
 in the standard of life of the workers that was fought by every generation,

1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:49.760
 you know, it takes your breath away. It's an argument, whoa. But I take my hat off if I had

1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:57.920
 one, because that is one of the only ways to justify this system. Long ago, let me get the

1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:07.360
 heart of it, long ago, capitalism could have overcome hunger, could have overcome disease,

1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:14.240
 could have, I mean, way beyond what we have now, but it didn't. And that's the worst

1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:23.520
 moral condemnation imaginable. How do you justify that when you could, you didn't?

1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:29.120
 Look, let me get at it another way, because this may interest you anyway.

1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:37.280
 The issue is not that capitalism isn't technologically dynamic, it is. And along the way,

1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:44.560
 it has developed things that have helped people's lives get better, no question. But the notion

1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:51.680
 that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built into capitalism

1:10:51.680 --> 1:11:00.400
 is factually nuts and is such an outrageous, and I can give you a, because you do math,

1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:06.400
 you'll understand it. Think of it this way. Imagine a production process in which you have

1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:13.200
 $100 that the capitalist has to lay out for tools, equipment, and raw materials,

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:20.080
 and $100 that he has to lay out for workers, hire the workers, and he puts them all together,

1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:26.880
 and he has an output. And let's say the output is 100 units of something at one of the prices,

1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:35.040
 and that's his revenue. And when he takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue,

1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:42.000
 let's say the revenue is, it doesn't really matter, it's 120, for lack of a better word,

1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:49.520
 220, sorry. And he takes 100 of it and replaces the tools, equipment, and raw materials he used up,

1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:54.240
 another 100 to hire the workers for the next shift, and the other 20 is his profit,

1:11:54.240 --> 1:12:01.200
 and he puts that aside. Now along comes a technological breakthrough, a machine, a new

1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:11.040
 machine. And the new machine is so effective, you can get the same number of units of output

1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:16.640
 with half the workers. So you don't need to spend 100 on workers, you only need to spend 50.

1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:22.080
 You can do it with half the workers. And so the capitalist goes to the workers,

1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:26.000
 by the way, this happens every day, and he says to half of them, you're fired.

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:31.680
 Don't come back Monday morning, I don't need you. It's nothing personal, I got a machine.

1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:39.120
 Why does he do that? Because the 50 he now no longer has to spend on labor because it doesn't

1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:44.800
 need half of them, he keeps. Everything else is the same, the machine, everything else is just

1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:52.800
 to make the math easy. So he keeps, as his own profit, the 50 that before he paid for those

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.480
 workers. Because when he sells it for 220, that 50 they'll have to give to the next

1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:04.080
 generation, because he has a new machine. So that's what he does. The technology leads,

1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:11.680
 he's happy, he's become more profitable, he's got an extra 50, which is why he buys the machine.

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:19.920
 The workers are screwed. Half of them just lost their job, have to go home to their husband and

1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:25.200
 wife, tell them I don't have a job anymore, I didn't do anything wrong. The guy was nice enough

1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:31.360
 to say it was nothing wrong with me, but he doesn't need them. So I'm completely screwed here,

1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:35.200
 I don't know what I'm going to do about the debts we have, the house on mortgage,

1:13:35.200 --> 1:13:38.320
 my children's education or whatever else he's got going for himself.

1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:45.360
 All right, now, now the point. There was, of course, an alternative path. The alternative

1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:50.240
 path would have been to keep all the workers, pay them exactly the same that you did before,

1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:59.200
 for half a day's work. You would have got the same output, same revenue, same profit as before.

1:14:00.960 --> 1:14:07.760
 But the gain of the technology would have been a half a day of freedom every day of the lives

1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:16.160
 of these workers. The majority of workers would have been really helped by this technology,

1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:23.520
 but instead they were screwed so that one guy, the employer, could make a big bundle of more

1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:30.880
 money. You want to support a system like this? Well, to go back to Hegel, the good and the bad.

1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:37.360
 So you just listed the bad and you also first listed the good, the technological innovation

1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:43.920
 of this kind of system. The question is the alternative, whatever, as we try to sneak up

1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:48.880
 to ideas of what the alternative might look like, what are the good and the bad of the alternative?

1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:56.400
 So you just kind of, as a opposite, by contrast, showed that, well, a nice alternative is you

1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:04.320
 work less, get paid the same, you have more leisure time, opportunity to pursue other

1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:11.280
 interests, other interests, the creative interests, family, flourish as a human being,

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:19.680
 basically strengthen and embolden the basic humanity that's under all of us. Yes. But then

1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:30.320
 what cost does that have on the deadline fueled, competition fueled machine

1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:35.360
 of technological innovation that is the positive side of capitalism?

1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:36.240
 It slows it down.

1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:43.440
 It slows it down. And the question is, which is more important for the flourishing of humanity?

1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:51.600
 I agree with that. And I'd love there to be a democratic mechanism. So let's discuss it,

1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:56.880
 let's debate it, and then let's decide what mixture, because it's not either or,

1:15:56.880 --> 1:16:01.520
 the math problem I gave you is either or, we could mix it, you could have

1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:06.720
 a third less of a working day instead of a half less, and then the other part would be extra

1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:12.960
 profit for our employer, et cetera, et cetera. So let's have a democratic discussion of what

1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:19.840
 is the mix between the positive and we have no such thing. All of this is decided by one side

1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:25.760
 in this debate, which not only we know what they do, they always choose the one that maximizes

1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:29.760
 their profit, because that's what they were told to do in business school where I've taught.

1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:36.880
 So not only is it an undemocratic decision, but it's lopsided to boot. So we don't have

1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:42.960
 the opportunity, but I would love for us to be good Hegelian Marxists and say,

1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:47.440
 let's take a look at the plus and the minus and make the best decision that we can.

1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:54.560
 We'll make mistakes, but we'll all make them together. It won't be one of us making a dictatorial

1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:59.840
 decision. You know, Marx developed the notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat, not as a

1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:05.680
 notion of how government is not, I'm sorry, not Marx, Lenin did that, not as a notion of how the

1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:12.160
 government works, but as a notion of what the practical reality is. The dictatorship of these

1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:18.480
 key decisions is not made by some sitting council. It's made by each little capitalist in his or

1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:25.040
 relationships with the workers in the workplace, which is why Marx focused his analysis on that

1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:29.680
 point. And by the way, I can sketch for you right now so it doesn't lurk in the background

1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:34.800
 what the alternative is. Let's go there. Okay. It goes right back to what I said earlier.

1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:44.800
 The workers of themselves, the collection of employees together appropriate their own surplus

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:52.800
 and decide democratically what to do with it, which includes the decision of whether or not

1:17:52.800 --> 1:18:01.040
 to buy a machine and whether or not to use the machine and the savings it might allow

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:12.000
 to be handled by more leisure for themselves or as a fund for new developments in technology

1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:20.560
 or new products or whatever they want. And you know, this is an old idea in humans. Marx loved

1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:27.600
 that. Toward the end of his life, he started reading extensively in anthropology. And one

1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:32.240
 of the reasons he did that toward the end of his life was because he kept discovering

1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:38.160
 that in this society and that, including here in the United States, that there were examples

1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:47.440
 of people who organized their production in precisely this way as a collective democratic

1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:54.640
 community in which everybody had an equal voice. So we all together decide democratically

1:18:54.640 --> 1:19:01.040
 what to produce, how to produce, where to produce, and what to do with the output we all helped to

1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:12.000
 produce. So let's do it in, you know, in this country where democracy is a value nearly everybody

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:19.600
 subscribes to. Think about it this way, the stunning contradiction that there is a place in our

1:19:19.600 --> 1:19:27.600
 society where democracy has never been allowed to enter. The workplace, in the workplace a tiny

1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:34.400
 group of people, unaccountable to the rest of them, the employer, whether that's an individual,

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:41.120
 a family, a partnership, or a corporate board of directors. A tiny group of people controls

1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:47.440
 economically a vast mass of employees. Those employees don't elect those people, have no

1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:54.800
 nothing, there is no accountability. It is the most undemocratic arrangement imaginable.

1:19:54.800 --> 1:20:02.960
 And this society insists on calling itself democratic when it has organized the minor

1:20:02.960 --> 1:20:08.240
 matter of producing everything in a way that is the direct, it's autocratic.

1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:16.320
 So to push back on a few things. So one is the idea of this society calling itself democratic

1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:22.480
 is that the government is elected democratically and the government is able to pressure the

1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:28.800
 workplace through the process of regulation. You pass laws of the boundaries of how, you know,

1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:34.960
 minimum wage, all those kinds of things. That's the one idea. The other is there is a natural

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:42.320
 force within the capitalist when there's no monopolies of competition being the accountability.

1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:48.960
 So if you're a shitty boss, the employee in the capitalist system has the freedom

1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:54.080
 to move to another company work for a better boss. So that that creates pressure on the

1:20:54.080 --> 1:21:00.080
 employers and the bosses. That's at least the idea that you there's two boundaries of

1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:06.640
 you not misbehaving. One is the law. So regulatory regulations by passed by the government,

1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:14.320
 democratic. And the second is because there's always alternatives in theory, then that puts

1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:21.040
 pressure on everyone to behave well, because you can always leave. So I mean, that's kinds of

1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:28.720
 accountability. But what you're saying is that does not result in a significant enough accountability

1:21:28.720 --> 1:21:32.960
 where the employer that avoids exploitation of the worker.

1:21:32.960 --> 1:21:39.200
 Absolutely. I mean, whatever accountability you get in those mechanisms. And let me respond to

1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:48.640
 that. And then I'll counter argument. First, competition. Here again, we have to be Hegelians

1:21:48.640 --> 1:21:56.880
 just a little competition destroys itself. It doesn't need any out. The whole point of competition

1:21:56.880 --> 1:22:02.960
 is to beat the other guy. If I can produce the same product as the other guy, either a better

1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:08.720
 quality or a lower price or maybe both, then I win because the customers will come to me

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:12.880
 because my price is lower or my quality is better. And they'll leave the other guy,

1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:17.520
 he'll go out of business. Now let's follow. When he goes out of business, because I won the

1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:24.640
 competition, he fires his workers. I hire them because I'm now going to be able to serve a

1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:29.520
 market he can't serve anymore. So I'm going to I'm going to buy the used equipment. I'm going

1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:40.160
 to, and thereby many become few. Monopoly is the product of competition. It's not the antithesis.

1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:47.040
 It's the product. Well, let's see. That's where it comes from. There's another element to the

1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:53.040
 system where there's always a new guy that comes in. There isn't. There isn't. That's the dream.

1:22:53.040 --> 1:23:00.560
 The entrepreneurial spirit of a free of the United States, for example, of a capitalist system is

1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:08.800
 you can be broke and one day have a strong idea and build up a business that takes on Google

1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:16.640
 and Facebook and Twitter and all the different car for GM, which is what you look at Tesla,

1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:23.600
 for example. That's the American dream. One of the many ideals of the American dream is you can

1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:33.920
 move from dirt poor to being the richest person in the world. It can happen.

1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:38.000
 It can happen, but you know what that's like. That's like you can win a lottery.

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:44.160
 No, that's not quite. No, the lottery is complete luck. Here you can work your ass off if you have

1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:50.160
 a good idea. The odds are better in the lottery. That's not true. There's a lot of new businesses.

1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:56.720
 How many Teslas do you know? Tesla's a really bad example because the car company, the automotive

1:23:56.720 --> 1:24:05.680
 sector is so difficult to operate as such a thin margin of profit. They're probably a good example

1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:11.760
 of capitalism just completely coming to a halt in terms of lack of innovation.

1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:16.880
 You know, that's a very complicated industry because of the supply chain.

1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:23.920
 Come on. They have their uniqueness as you're quite right, but so does every other industry.

1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:29.840
 The one thing that's common is that many become few. What you can also have is when you have a few,

1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:36.640
 they jack up the price. They make an enormous profit. In the irony of capitalism, Marx would

1:24:36.640 --> 1:24:43.520
 love this, they begin to incentivize people to break into this industry because the few remaining

1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:50.240
 are making a wild amount of profit because they are a few and can jigger the market to make it work

1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:58.640
 like that for them. But the reason every small capitalist is trying to build market share,

1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:04.400
 that's a polite way of saying they want to become a monopolist or to be more exact,

1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:09.760
 an oligopolist, one of a handful of firms that dominates. That's what they're there for.

1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:16.160
 But yeah, to push back a little bit also, because that could be, this is a question also,

1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:22.960
 do you think we're in danger of oversimplifying capitalism that completely removes the basic

1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:33.120
 decency of human beings? So if you give me a choice to press a button to get rid of the

1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:37.680
 competition, but that's going to lead to a lot of suffering, there's a lot of people at the heads

1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:43.520
 of companies that won't press that button. That it's not in the calculation, it's not just money,

1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:53.520
 it's human well being too. So like, yes, you and I don't live in the same place then.

1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:58.560
 So you're saying that the forces of capitalism take over the minds of the people at the top.

1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:02.480
 You're good. And then they seize being human, essentially.

1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:05.760
 The basic, okay. I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I mean, that's fine.

1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:11.120
 Depending on your model of humans, but they lose track of the better angels of their nature,

1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:15.520
 and they just become cogs in the machine, but they just happen to be the cogs at the top.

1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:21.120
 I would put it differently, that the system is so set up, it's a little bit like natural selection.

1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:26.560
 The guys who may, I could say the women too, it doesn't matter, the people who make it up through

1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:33.040
 the layers of the bureaucracy and get to the top in these things have had to do things along the way

1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:38.160
 that becomes selective. If they can't stand it, because they have that human quality,

1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:43.760
 and there are people like, I've known them. They're the ones running an Airbnb in Vermont.

1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:49.440
 They went there and they said, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not going to treat people like that.

1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:54.960
 I'm going to make a lovely place in Vermont with my husband or my wife or whatever, and I'm going to

1:26:54.960 --> 1:27:01.520
 be enjoying the people that come by and be a decent human. Of course, of course, but the system

1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:08.800
 selects the firm. If you don't do what has to be done to make the profit go up, you're toast

1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:13.680
 there anyway. The rest of the people who vote for you are going to kick you out. You can tell them

1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:18.000
 all day long what a lovely person you are. They're going to look at you and wonder,

1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:21.840
 what happened to you? How did you even get this far with the lovely person horseshoe?

1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:31.360
 It's not necessarily just lovely person. Maybe I'll just say my bias is the people I know are

1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:40.800
 especially at the top of companies that are in the tech sector where innovation is such a big

1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:47.760
 part of it. I think a lot of the things we're talking about is when there's not much innovation

1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:56.480
 in the system. Innovation usually comes in the history of capitalism. Innovation comes in spurts.

1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:01.680
 There's the electric period, the chemistry period, the nuclear period. There's now whatever you want

1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:08.720
 to call it, the artificial intelligence or robotics or computer. It comes and then there's a flurry

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:15.920
 as everything is reorganized around whatever the newest technology is, and then you have a period

1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:21.680
 where you can get excited about that. The very rich people who come to the top can talk endlessly

1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:32.880
 as they always do about innovation. Again, this is a recurring kind of debate and a recurring

1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:41.440
 kind of issue. For me, how do I put this in a way that I don't mean to offend.

1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:45.040
 So please, please. No, no, no. I don't want to. But

1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:57.440
 the problem with capitalism is, and maybe you'll like this, the problem with capitalism is

1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:03.600
 not that it is the one thing that's consistent with human nature. That's what its defenders

1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:08.480
 would like to have us believe. But if anything, I would argue the opposite,

1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:18.640
 that it is such a contradiction to parts of our nature, not other parts, that it can never quite

1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:24.560
 make it. There's always going to be the people who don't go along with it, people you're talking

1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:32.240
 about, who do quit along the way, or maybe a few of them actually make it to the top. By God knows

1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:39.280
 what hook or what crook that they did it. But most of them go, and you know why? Because their

1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:48.560
 humanity is contradicted by what it is they're being asked to do. I mean, the corporate sector

1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:58.160
 this year, just to give you an idea, CEOs are jacking up their wage package. They're already

1:29:58.160 --> 1:30:05.280
 out of whack. I mean, the average CEO pay is now 300 times what the average worker pays,

1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:09.200
 but they're jacking it up even more. Why? Because that's what's happening in their

1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:14.000
 universe. That's what they're all doing it, and they have to do. Each one of them justifies that

1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:18.320
 I have to do that, otherwise I'd lose my guy to the next one, which of course is true,

1:30:18.320 --> 1:30:23.520
 but is no comfort for the mass of people who want CEOs for whom this argument isn't very exciting.

1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:32.000
 So, they're doing that at a time when the American people can't cope. They've just gone

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:38.320
 through the COVID disaster. They've gone through the worst, second worst economic crash of capitalism

1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:46.160
 in our history. After two years of this one, two punch, they got an inflation, a third punch,

1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:50.640
 and we are now predicting rising interest rates and a recession at the end of the year

1:30:50.640 --> 1:30:55.760
 or early next year. You can't do this to a working class. When this was done to the

1:30:55.760 --> 1:31:02.160
 German working class in the 1920s, Hitler was the result. You keep doing that in this country.

1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:07.360
 We're already watching it. You're going to get that too. You're already getting bits and pieces.

1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:11.920
 You can't keep doing this. So, there's a quiet suffering amidst the working class that's growing.

1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:16.560
 Hard. Taking out on it. That can turn to anger. Some little 18 year old kid who has to go

1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:25.120
 three hours in his car and blow away people in a supermarket. And it happens every day in this

1:31:25.120 --> 1:31:32.320
 country, every day. So, that anger rises up in those little ways now and bigger, bigger,

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:40.400
 bigger potentially. By the way, there's one more thing on the rationality and this goes to Elon Musk.

1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:50.000
 If you're interested, 49,000 people were killed in automobile accidents this last year. The number

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:57.040
 was just released yesterday. 49,000. Automobiles are the single largest pollutant in the country.

1:31:57.040 --> 1:32:03.600
 They use up an enormous amount of energy. They use up enormous and our resources.

1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:13.040
 There is a way to make transportation much more rational. And we've known it for decades. It's

1:32:13.040 --> 1:32:20.800
 called mass transportation. It's a really beautifully maintained, crystal clear, clean,

1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:30.480
 frequent system of buses, trains, street trolleys, vans. It could easily be done in this society.

1:32:30.480 --> 1:32:38.400
 In fact, I once did a project that I estimated cost $30 billion. That's less than we're sending to

1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:41.360
 Ukraine to do this, to reconfigure it.

1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:44.000
 A public transit system where?

1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:47.920
 Everywhere in this country. All the major metropolitan. This country's overwhelmingly

1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:51.680
 metropolitan area. Well, it surely has to be more than $30 billion.

1:32:51.680 --> 1:32:55.440
 Well, it was a few years ago. Sure. But you're saying it's not.

1:32:55.440 --> 1:32:57.360
 But I'm using a lot of it. That's insane.

1:32:57.360 --> 1:32:58.800
 Right. It's not crazy stuff.

1:32:58.800 --> 1:33:00.960
 It's a reasonable number. Right.

1:33:00.960 --> 1:33:03.600
 But there's a... Let me just finish the point.

1:33:03.600 --> 1:33:04.080
 Sure. Yes.

1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:08.400
 Okay. So I'm trying to be rational here.

1:33:10.400 --> 1:33:15.600
 If we have a climate crisis, which everyone tells me we do, if it's got a lot to do with

1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:20.560
 fossil fuels, which everybody tells me it has to do, and with the use of the fossil fuel,

1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:25.920
 particularly for the automobile, then the solution to the problem would be mass transit.

1:33:25.920 --> 1:33:30.400
 But we don't... We're doing nothing to make that happen. Nothing.

1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:37.120
 Well, there's... On... You could argue that autonomous vehicles is a kind of public transit

1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:43.840
 because it's going to be reasonable vehicles. It will end, in theory, car ownership. So you

1:33:43.840 --> 1:33:46.640
 just have a more kind of distributed public transit system.

1:33:46.640 --> 1:33:52.000
 If it happens, but you know that that's a side effect. His major goal and the major

1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:58.240
 goal of the other companies that are busy squeezing to get his share of the pie smaller,

1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:02.640
 so they have some for General Motors to tell you, all of them are making electric cars.

1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:08.240
 So what they've done is they've replaced the individual car with fossil fuel

1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:11.280
 with another individual car. Yeah.

1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:13.920
 That's fucking nuts. What are you doing?

1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:16.720
 It's one of the things they're doing, but automation is also another one.

1:34:16.720 --> 1:34:21.440
 But on the Elon side, there's also a hilariously named boring company.

1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:28.560
 Yes. Which is working on tunnels, which is actually expanding the flexibility you might have

1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:34.560
 to start playing with ideas of public transit, I think. Listen, I'm now partially living in

1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:40.080
 Austin, Texas, that I don't know if they know what a public transit system is, period.

1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:40.960
 Yes.

1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:42.320
 There's... Most American cities.

1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:46.720
 Pickup trucks. Well, this is an interesting... So...

1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:53.360
 The older... By the way, footnote, the older this city, the more likely it has public transportation.

1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:54.800
 So you're saying...

1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:56.400
 Boston is the best example. Yes.

1:34:56.400 --> 1:34:58.160
 Have you been... Well, you...

1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:00.320
 Yeah, yeah. Of course. Yeah, I have a place in Boston.

1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:05.040
 Boston with the street railway. Boston is your case study of how to do this,

1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:07.840
 because they've been doing it all along. New York's pretty good, too.

1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:12.000
 There's a trade out. Yeah, New York, I would say, is better than Boston because there's...

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:17.120
 You know, their technology also helps you out to do the public transit better.

1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:21.200
 It's almost like Boston is a little too old, but yes, I get your point.

1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:30.640
 But there is a... The Ford F150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America, and there

1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:38.320
 is a practical nature to the fact that in order to do public transit, in order to do some of these

1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:44.880
 things that you're talking about with the working class, there has to be a central planning component,

1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:52.880
 or there has to be a centralized component. And America is very much based on the idea of,

1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:57.600
 at least in recent times, well, I would say from the founding of individualism,

1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:05.840
 of respecting individual freedom. Are you worried that in order to bring some of these ideas of

1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:13.360
 Marxism to life, you would trample on individual freedoms? No. Can you respect both?

1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:21.360
 Sure. For me, Marxism is a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people who

1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:28.400
 have had that freedom eroded under the capitalism. That's a motive for my Marxism. It was for Marx,

1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:35.360
 too. He loved the French Revolution. He loved the liberté, égalité, fraternité, the great

1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:41.280
 three, and then democracy, the American contribution, if you like. He believed in all of that. His

1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:47.440
 critique of capitalism was, it promised it and then never delivered it. And the reason you have

1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:57.280
 to go beyond it is because it didn't deliver what it had promised. So, for me, it is the fulfillment

1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:08.240
 of agenda. But again, I'm a Hegelian Marxist, so if you want. Individualism, for me, is not

1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:16.560
 the way it's set up in this society. Some sort of antithesis to the government. I think an immense

1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:23.760
 con has been pulled on the American people. And the con works like this. You know what's

1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:28.800
 bad and what's dangerous and threatens you? It's the government. The government's going to come in

1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:33.600
 and tell you what to do. The government's going to run your life. The government's the problem.

1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:37.520
 There really is no other way to explain the following in American politics.

1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:44.560
 Large numbers of people lose their homes in a downturn, like the so called Great Recession

1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:51.920
 of 2008. Who do they blame? The government. Large numbers of people go unemployed. And what

1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:58.720
 are the media all about? The government. If I were a capitalist, I'd love this. I kicked the

1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:03.680
 workers by throwing them out of their home. And they don't get angry with me. They get angry with

1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:08.960
 the government. I fire large numbers of people. I have no responsibility for what happens to them

1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:15.840
 as a result of having no job and no income. And they get angry at the senator. I'm laughing all

1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:23.200
 the way to the bank. This is a genius stroke. In theory. But if you look at government, because

1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:27.360
 you said accountability in the capitalist system has no accountability. There's some pushback

1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:31.600
 I give on the accountability. I think there is some accountability work we can discuss in a

1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:39.120
 Galilean way. There's more accountability for, I would say, that in theory, government is

1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:44.800
 perfectly accountable. That's the whole point of a democratic system, is you vote people in.

1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:52.400
 In practice, there's a giant growing bureaucracy that is accountable only on the surface. There's

1:38:52.400 --> 1:39:02.640
 two parties that seem to be, are the same media somehow integrated into making the same two

1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:08.400
 parties that are just wearing different colored shirts to seem like they're very opposed and

1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:14.080
 are arguing and bitterly arguing and calling each other's names and nasty names and all those

1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:23.520
 kinds of things. But that's government. Who exactly is worse here? Government or companies?

1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:30.400
 Why are we asking that question? These are twins. Look, what you were able to say about

1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:34.800
 Republicans and Democrats just now, with which I agree, I would say the same thing about

1:39:34.800 --> 1:39:38.400
 corporations and the government. This is the same people, literally the same.

1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:44.560
 Let's go to Churchill. Which one is worse? Let's go to Churchill. Democracy is the

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:50.480
 worst formal government except all the other ones or whatever. This same idea, which one

1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:54.640
 exactly is worse? Because to me, it seems like... Which one between what and what?

1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:01.040
 Government and industry and companies. It's because government is plagued by...

1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:11.280
 I will call it corruption because the corruption of bureaucratic paperwork and then because

1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:15.520
 they're not accountable. There doesn't seem to be a serious accountability.

1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:22.800
 Again, we're not living on the same planet. The greatest practitioners of central planning

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:32.400
 are corporations. Elon has an operation like General Motors, Ford, IBM, or any of the other

1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:41.120
 megacorps. They have to plan. They buy up companies because they don't want to deal in the market.

1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:48.560
 They don't want the insecurity, the uncertainty of having to buy their inputs or sell their outputs

1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:54.720
 to somebody they don't control. They want the professor to teach the genius of a market.

1:40:54.720 --> 1:41:00.960
 They hate the market and when they grow to be big, they keep buying whoever they were dealing with

1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:07.280
 before so they could better control them, which requires them then to plan the production and

1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:14.400
 distribution of goods inside rather than buying them in the market. The model of the government

1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:21.840
 is the private corporation. I have spent my life, give you an example, in American universities,

1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:28.880
 big ones, famous ones, not just as a student but as a professor. I teach there at the new school

1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:37.840
 here. It's another one. They all model themselves after businesses. You can attack the bureaucracy

1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:46.640
 of universities. Good reason. It's a mess. But they're proudly modeling themselves on organizing

1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:54.480
 their bureaucracy in a businesslike manner. You're looking at a difference which isn't there.

1:41:55.120 --> 1:42:02.160
 The government and the private sector are partners and both of them wouldn't have it any other way.

1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:08.000
 The corporations want that from the government and the government now knows that to please the

1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:14.160
 corporations is the number one objective they have because that's how they keep their jobs and

1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:20.640
 keep their system going. For all practical purposes, this is the same people.

1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:27.920
 But there's important differences that I don't know if they're fundamental or just a consequence

1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:32.880
 of history. But if you have government, they're accountable in a different way than companies.

1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:38.800
 Companies are accountable by, especially if you have a consumer, they're accountable by

1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:42.880
 sort of the consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the heck the company is

1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:53.200
 selling. The government is accountable by votes. It seems like government, unlike companies,

1:42:53.200 --> 1:43:00.080
 for most of companies, history is always too big to fail, meaning it can always just print money.

1:43:00.640 --> 1:43:09.520
 It can always save itself and that creates a bureaucracy. You rarely pay the cost of

1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:13.680
 having made bad decisions if you're in government. You distribute the blame

1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:19.920
 and it's very unclear who's responsible for bad decisions, so bad decisions in government

1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:26.240
 accumulate. You become more and more and more inefficient and more and more poor in your

1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:31.200
 decision making in terms of, you said public transit, should we build a public transit system

1:43:31.200 --> 1:43:35.280
 in this city or not? That's a difficult decision. That's an interesting decision.

1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:41.920
 I would say it's very often a very good decision, but whoever makes that decision should be

1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:47.440
 accountable for a good or bad decision and it seems like companies are more accountable.

1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:54.400
 They feel the pain of having made a bad decision more because they can go bankrupt.

1:43:56.160 --> 1:44:02.800
 There's much more day to day pressure to make good engineering decisions. Government doesn't

1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:07.760
 seem to be under the same level of pressure. Do you disagree with that?

1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:11.840
 I disagree with that. Everything in my history pushes me.

1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:20.000
 You may be living, I may be living in a different, who knows, a planet or taking a

1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:27.200
 different sort of drug. I won't mention the name, but I personally had a lot to do with a

1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:37.600
 very large company here in the United States, here in the New York area. It involved two brothers

1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:46.560
 and a family who built it up into a huge corporation. One of the brothers was kind of the

1:44:46.560 --> 1:44:52.640
 dynamo of the family and he was more responsible than anybody else building it up.

1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:57.520
 But he took care of his brothers. He had a nice feeling about his brother. So

1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:05.680
 the one brother who could not, you know, without help tie his shoes became a vice president.

1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:13.120
 He got an enormous salary, got a beautiful office in a skyscraper, not that many blocks

1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:21.840
 from where I'm sitting right now. And that was the way that family handled that company.

1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:28.800
 And all of his relatives that were somewhere in this company, doing a variety of whatever,

1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:36.000
 because, and my experience with this, and because I went to the schools I told you,

1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:42.000
 all my experiences with that group of people, corporate executives, full of those stories,

1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:49.760
 you know, they made mistake after mistake, which they would tell you about, didn't undermine

1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:57.840
 there. They were always able to blame somebody else, something else that scraped them through.

1:45:57.840 --> 1:46:02.800
 And had they not been able to, they would have been replaced by another person who did the same

1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:09.600
 thing for as long as they could. And they knew it. They would talk about it at family events.

1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:16.560
 That's how I know. I understand that you want the outside world to look at it this way,

1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:25.040
 but it's not my experience. But again, what's that kind of thing at the risk of saying human

1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:33.360
 nature again, I wonder what kind of system allows for that more versus, versus less. This is the

1:46:33.360 --> 1:46:37.760
 question of the, I would call that, let's put that under the umbrella term of corruption.

1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:42.960
 Which system allows for more corruption? But remember that the way I defined the

1:46:42.960 --> 1:46:48.720
 different system is not more or less government. It's more or less allowing a democratic workplace.

1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:56.880
 Yeah. Reconfiguring it. What happens when everybody has a vote, when you have to explain

1:46:57.600 --> 1:47:03.120
 what the strategies are, what the alternatives are to a larger number of people than on board of

1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:08.800
 directors or major shareholders or whoever it is that most companies are responsible to.

1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:14.960
 And now you've got a whole different universe. It's not a small group of people. Can't be hidden

1:47:14.960 --> 1:47:21.200
 the way it's normally hidden, most of it on and on and on. This is, you know, worker coops is what

1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:25.360
 this is called in many parts of the world. So it's not that I'm advocating something that's

1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:34.000
 never been seen before, not at all. The Marxism, I understand, is to pick from historical precedents

1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:41.120
 the things that we think will work better. And I think if all the people in an enterprise,

1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:46.720
 just to drive the point home, democratically decided, they would never give two or three

1:47:46.720 --> 1:47:51.600
 individuals $100 million while everybody else can't send their kid to college. Have you ever

1:47:51.600 --> 1:48:01.120
 gone do that? So just to address this point about the particular implementation of Marxism

1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:08.320
 that was the early days in the Soviet Union, why did Stalinism, for example, lead to so much

1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:15.200
 bloodshed, do you think, in human suffering? Is there any elements within the ideas of Marxism

1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:25.520
 that catalyzed the kind of government, the kind of system that led to that bloodshed?

1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:31.280
 I don't think so. I think there were many things that led to the bloodshed and to all that Stalin's

1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:41.440
 regimes did. And I spent 10 years of my life with another economist writing a book

1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:49.360
 about that to try to explain from a Marxist position the rise and fall of the Soviet Union.

1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:55.440
 You might want to take a look at it sometime. But there, I'm going to say a few things now,

1:48:55.440 --> 1:49:02.080
 but all of those things are spelled out in great detail with loads of empirical evidence, etc.

1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:09.280
 in that work. Let me start with playing a little bit with Hegel.

1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:20.480
 The biggest impact that Marxism had on the Soviet Union was really not so much what the

1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:26.800
 Soviet Union did, but what the rest of the world did. You had a really interesting move,

1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:37.600
 and I'll give you a parallel from today. The move was that the old Russian regime collapsed.

1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:46.000
 World War I, it just fell apart. The Tsar and all of that, it couldn't survive. It had already

1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:51.840
 been in trouble. There was a revolution in 1905. There was the loss of the war to Japan. I mean,

1:49:51.840 --> 1:49:58.240
 if you know Russian history, which I assume you do, you'll know that there was a lot leading up to

1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:08.720
 the collapse in 1917. And in some ways, it was fortuitous that the political group, very small,

1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:17.440
 that could seize the opportunity of that collapse, happened to be Marxists. Early Iran, with Karensky,

1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:23.680
 the first government that tried, it wasn't people all that impressed by Marxism. It was people

1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:31.200
 more skeptical and would not have been called Marxists probably by history. They tried. They

1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:39.120
 couldn't. Lenin and his associates were able to take over from them later in that same year. The

1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:46.080
 rest of the world, though, was horrified. The rest of the world saw Marxism having taken this

1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:55.120
 immense leap from being a political party, a movement, critical of capitalism, yes, but still

1:50:55.120 --> 1:51:02.080
 not challenging the power. Now it had the power and in a big country. And they freaked out.

1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:09.680
 If you know American history, this country, the leadership of this country went completely berserk.

1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:16.400
 I mean, we had a repression of the left, the likes of which we had not seen before. The

1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:27.520
 20s were a time of palmerades in Boston, the Sackle Vensetti trials, really grim hostility.

1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:33.360
 And you had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the revolution.

1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:39.120
 The U.S., Britain, France, and Japan all attacked 10,000 American troops.

1:51:39.120 --> 1:51:49.840
 So what you had right away was a notion in the West that this was unthinkable. There was a great

1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:57.440
 professor at Princeton, Meyer, forget his first name, who wrote this wonderful book about all

1:51:57.440 --> 1:52:05.760
 American foreign policy since 1917 has been obsessed with Russia. Even now, this fight with

1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:12.240
 Ukraine is half about Russia as if Russia still was the Soviet Union, as if people haven't figured

1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:22.400
 out. That was a big change back in 1989 and 1990. Yeltsin and Putin are not what you had before,

1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:27.600
 or at least they're not Lenin. They may not be so different from some of the other, but in any case.

1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:41.760
 So you had one factor was the utter isolation, the utter condemnation, the global. I assume

1:52:41.760 --> 1:52:47.840
 you know that Rosa Luxemburg is hunted down in the streets of Berlin. She's a critic of Lenins,

1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:53.120
 by the way, but she's a leftist, hunted down and hacked into bits, killed.

1:52:53.120 --> 1:53:00.880
 So you are attributing some of the bloodshed to the fact that basically the rest of the world

1:53:00.880 --> 1:53:02.880
 turned away. Turned against.

1:53:02.880 --> 1:53:05.840
 Turned against. So if you turn against, is the better way.

1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:12.880
 Very, yeah. I mean, not in order of importance, but it's a very important part of the psychology

1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:19.120
 of being, you know. It's what you would call paranoid if there weren't quite as much evidence

1:53:19.120 --> 1:53:23.840
 that indeed there was a lot to be afraid of at that time. Nobody had ever done it. Look,

1:53:23.840 --> 1:53:30.400
 you could see the effects of it by Stalin inventing the idea, which had no support at first,

1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:37.280
 that you could have socialism in one country. That was thought to be ridiculous, that socialism was

1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:44.080
 internationalism. Marx was against capitalism everywhere. It was, you know, workers of the

1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:52.720
 world unite, not workers of Russia unite, workers of the... He had to go through a procedure of

1:53:52.720 --> 1:53:59.120
 kind of coming to terms with the fact that the revolution he had in Russia, which was tried

1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:05.680
 in Berlin, was tried in Munich, was tried in Budapest, was tried in Seattle here, they all

1:54:05.680 --> 1:54:13.280
 failed. They all failed, and he's left. So the French would say. Tout ça, right? You know, all alone.

1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:21.760
 That's one. The second thing is economic isolation. Russia's a poor country, and it needed

1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:26.960
 what it got before the war, which were heavy investments from the French and the Germans,

1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:32.800
 particularly, but others too. Now this was all cut off. And you can see the replay

1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:38.000
 with the sanctions program. We're going to do it again. We're going to do it again.

1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:43.600
 We have to do it. The world is different and the sanctions don't work, but they're going to try them.

1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:51.040
 Because it's the history. But that culture, today is completely different. Russia's a different

1:54:51.040 --> 1:54:57.440
 place today, but Russia has China, and that changes everything. And they don't get that here yet,

1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:02.240
 but they will. Yeah, there's a very complicated dynamic with China, even with India.

1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:05.760
 Yep. Or Turkey. Brazil.

1:55:06.320 --> 1:55:10.320
 Yeah. Sorry to say human nature may change at a slower pace.

1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:15.040
 Yes. That has occurred to me as well. I get that point.

1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:21.600
 So can you steel man the case, or consider the case, that there's something about the

1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:28.320
 implementation of Marxism, maybe because of the idealistic nature of focusing on the working

1:55:28.320 --> 1:55:36.800
 class and workers unite that naturally leads to a formation of a dictatorial force, a dictator

1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:46.640
 that says, let us temporarily give power to this person to manage some of the details of how to

1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:54.080
 run the democracy of giving voice to the workers. So they get to choose. And then that naturally

1:55:54.080 --> 1:56:00.000
 leads to a dictator. And there's naturally inhuman nature, power and absolute power,

1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:06.480
 as the old adage goes, corrupts. Absolutely. Is it possible that whenever you focus on Marxist

1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:13.120
 ideals, you're going to end up with a dictator. And often, when you give too much power to anyone,

1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:16.560
 human, a small number of people, you're going to get into a huge amount of trouble.

1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.240
 You've put things together there that I would.

1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:24.000
 That's what... I think if you give... Putsch does a good word.

1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:31.840
 Yeah, German. Remember, I told you, my mother was born in Germany.

1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:33.520
 And then your dad is French.

1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:39.600
 Yeah, but he was born in Metz, if you know European. It's a city on the border of France

1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:45.520
 in Germany. If you come from... Alsaceans, Alsace in German.

1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:46.880
 So they're German speaking French.

1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:52.560
 You have to do both. It's bilingual because it's been back and forth so many times

1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:58.480
 in medieval days already that it literally, you go from one store to another. The proprietor here

1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:02.640
 is French and the proprietor there is German, but they all speak both languages because...

1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:06.320
 You don't speak either of them?

1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:07.280
 I speak Russian.

1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:09.200
 Russian, but not German or French.

1:57:09.200 --> 1:57:14.000
 Ukrainian, no. It took French for four years in high school, but I've forgotten all of it.

1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:19.120
 I remember the romance and the spirit of the language, but not the details. I'm sure I can

1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:29.200
 remember. If you allocate power unequally, undemocratically, and you do it for a very long

1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:38.800
 period of time, and you do it on many levels of ideology, it is not surprising that it sticks

1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:44.880
 and it stays. You can make a political revolution or even an economic revolution and you will

1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:51.760
 discover it has a life of its own and it's going to take a long time before people don't.

1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:59.920
 If you have a religious tradition, Christianity, that prides itself on its monotheism and that

1:57:59.920 --> 1:58:05.280
 it doesn't want to have anything to do with the old Greek mythologies when there was Zeus and Diana

1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:11.920
 and all the others, and they were very human like, but instead we have one who is the absolute

1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:20.000
 beginning. What are you doing? You're teaching people an authority line that comes from the

1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:26.240
 individual. If you have a sequence of kings, if in your feudal manner the Lord sits,

1:58:26.800 --> 1:58:33.040
 called to the landlord, he has unspeakable power over everything that goes on, and you do this

1:58:33.040 --> 1:58:39.840
 for thousands of years. You can make a Russian revolution in 1917, but if you imagine you've

1:58:39.840 --> 1:58:46.640
 gotten away from all that people assume without ever thinking about it, you're going to have trouble.

1:58:48.160 --> 1:58:56.960
 Stalin is figured here as the originator of his situation. He wasn't. He never had that power.

1:58:56.960 --> 1:59:03.840
 He may have thought that, but I don't. He's the product. Look, the Cuban people made Fidel,

1:59:04.400 --> 1:59:09.120
 who really wasn't that kind of guy. He was a baseball playing lawyer. That's what he was,

1:59:09.760 --> 1:59:16.240
 but they made him into Tala. So it's not the system of the people?

1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:23.680
 No, no, no. It was the systems, feudalism, the literature. It was the structures and institutions

1:59:23.680 --> 1:59:31.920
 that cultivated in people a mentality that has its own rhythm and doesn't follow the calendar

1:59:31.920 --> 1:59:36.240
 of a political revolution. That's the fundamental question. Is there something about communism

1:59:36.960 --> 1:59:44.400
 that creates some mentality that enables somebody like Stalin or Mao?

1:59:44.960 --> 1:59:51.120
 No, I think it's the social issues and problems the society has that make them then go to what

1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:56.720
 they find familiar to what seems to make sense, and he's the guy. Look, let me give you an example

1:59:56.720 --> 2:00:02.880
 from American history. The Republican Party has traditionally in this country been the party of

2:00:02.880 --> 2:00:11.200
 private enterprise and minimum government. Income Trump runs for office in 2016, is elected.

2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:20.160
 What does he do? He commences the most massive tax increase and the most massive government

2:00:20.160 --> 2:00:27.440
 intervention in the worlds of economics that we've had for decades. Nobody says anything.

2:00:28.400 --> 2:00:38.880
 The Republicans cave, and the Democrats largely too. They cave. He can throw a tariff on anything.

2:00:39.440 --> 2:00:44.080
 He gets up in front of the American people and he says the Chinese will pay the tariff.

2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:50.080
 That's not what a tariff is. It's not how a tariff works. He would flunk a freshman

2:00:50.080 --> 2:00:55.040
 course in economics, which everybody knows. Everybody who teaches these courses knows.

2:00:55.040 --> 2:01:02.000
 It doesn't matter. He's still calling the shots. What is going on here is that a society has come

2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:13.760
 to a point where it can't solve its problems and it begins what? To tap into older forms and all of

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:22.320
 the laissez faire and all of the individualism. Suddenly, the Republican Party is gone. Now

2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:27.440
 they're going to make an abortion illegal. The government is telling you what you can do with

2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:35.040
 your uterus. What? What? The government is being given more and more and more and more power.

2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:43.200
 They're hoping what? Do they like the government? No. They're desperate. This is not a pro government

2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:51.440
 and it wasn't in Russia. They were in a desperate fix. He took advantage.

2:01:51.440 --> 2:02:01.040
 To which degree would you say Marx's ideas led to the creation of the

2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:11.280
 national socialism party of German workers, hence the Nazi party, the fascist party in the 30s

2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:17.360
 and the 40s, that the head of whom was Hitler, which had just recently learned he was

2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:23.680
 employee number seven of the party or whatever, the seventh person to have joined the party

2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:30.160
 and have created one of the most consequential and powerful political parties in the history

2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:37.520
 of the 20th century. What degree did Marx's ideas, Marxism ideas have to play? It is the

2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:51.600
 national socialist party of German workers. The national socialist German worker party.

2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:58.800
 Worker party. National socialist German worker party. Here's the history. Did he care about

2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:04.880
 the workers or did he just use the workers as a populist message? The only thing that Marxism

2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:12.080
 did for Mr. Hitler was provide him with his stepping stone to power, but had nothing no other.

2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:15.760
 He didn't know anything about it, didn't care anything about it, nor did the people around

2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:21.440
 him. Here's the story of what happened there, which I know largely through my own family and

2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:28.400
 plus my own history, the work that I did. The most successful socialist party in Europe was

2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:35.440
 the German party. It started around 1870. Marx was still alive. Some of his own family were

2:03:35.440 --> 2:03:42.960
 leaders, Ferdinand Lassalle and other his daughters. By the end of the century, it was the second

2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:50.080
 most important party in Germany. Nobody understood it. It was over. It was almost as big a shock

2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:57.680
 to the Europeans as was the Russian Revolution in 1970. Here was a political party that was now

2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:07.200
 in every German city, in every German town, powerful and enjoying its rise up. That's my

2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:13.040
 family is involved in this. I mean, I really do know the story. It meant that starting

2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:24.880
 around 1968, if you wanted to have any kind of presence in the German working class,

2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:30.160
 you had to use the word socialist. You had to. Otherwise, they wouldn't pay attention.

2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:37.600
 The other parties called themselves Catholic. Germany is divided. The northern two thirds

2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:43.360
 is Protestant. The southern third is Catholic. Munich and Bavaria is Catholic and every other

2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:49.360
 part of Germany basically is Protestant. You could be in the Catholic party, that was the south,

2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:56.960
 or you could be in various conservative Prussian and other. If you wanted to have a presence in

2:04:56.960 --> 2:05:03.280
 the working class, which was growing in Germany, a very powerful capitalist country, expanding like

2:05:03.280 --> 2:05:09.760
 crazy at this time, Germany was the major competitor to Britain for the empire. The United States

2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:17.360
 was coming up too, but it was Germany and US taking over from Britain's empire. The German

2:05:17.360 --> 2:05:25.040
 working class was it. Anybody who wanted to approach the working class in whatever way

2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:34.640
 had to come to terms and be friendly to socialism. Other parties did this too, just like Hitler.

2:05:34.640 --> 2:05:40.160
 They put the word socialist in their party, but they wanted to make it clear that they weren't

2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:47.200
 anything to do with the Soviet Union or anything to do with Marxism, so they put the word national.

2:05:47.760 --> 2:05:54.160
 Nazi is the first four letters of national, national in German, and they ZI is how you

2:05:54.160 --> 2:05:58.880
 spell national in the German language. National socialism, but definitely not communists.

2:05:58.880 --> 2:06:05.120
 That's right. They killed communists. They fought communists in the street. They had pitched battles.

2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:11.600
 They literally threatened each other's existence and their lives. The first people that he arrested

2:06:11.600 --> 2:06:17.360
 and put in jail were not Jews and Gypsies and all the other people. He eventually killed. It was

2:06:17.360 --> 2:06:24.320
 communists. They were the number one and socialist right behind them. Why? Because up until he takes

2:06:24.320 --> 2:06:31.600
 power, January of 1933, that's when Hitler takes power. The last elections, two of them in 1932,

2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:39.360
 the socialist and communist, the vote together, 50% of the vote in Germany. He appealed to the

2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:46.160
 German manufacturers, the German capitalists, and he said, the communists and socialists are going

2:06:46.160 --> 2:06:54.960
 to win. You're just the capitalist. You have too few people. You need a mass base, and I'm the only

2:06:54.960 --> 2:07:00.880
 one that can do that. That was just the populist message that he used. That's right, but it was

2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:10.000
 explicitly done as a deal. The ruling group said to Hindenburg, the old Prussian man who was in charge

2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:15.920
 of the German government at the time, you have to invite Hitler to form a new government. Otherwise,

2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:21.280
 he would never have done it. He had called Hitler nasty names before. The Prussian aristocracy looked

2:07:21.280 --> 2:07:26.960
 down on Hitler as a little funny man with a mustache who was Austrian, wasn't even German.

2:07:26.960 --> 2:07:37.200
 For them, that mattered. He comes in as the enemy, the smasher of socialism and communism,

2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:46.080
 which he immediately does. Only people who don't know or care about the history pick up on the

2:07:46.080 --> 2:07:52.160
 word. It's like there are people here in the United States who like to say,

2:07:52.160 --> 2:08:00.800
 we are not a democracy. We are a republic, which is like saying, I'm not a banana. I'm a fruit.

2:08:01.520 --> 2:08:08.720
 You have to explain to these people a banana. You have to explain to people, yes, we're a republic,

2:08:09.280 --> 2:08:15.040
 but we have a commitment to democracy as a way to govern the republic, because to say you're a

2:08:15.040 --> 2:08:19.600
 republic doesn't imply what kind of government. You have to go through that with people so they

2:08:19.600 --> 2:08:26.560
 kind of get it. Certain words have power beyond their actual meaning. They're used in communication,

2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:32.080
 whether it's negative, like racist, or positive, like freedom of speech.

2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:33.920
 Or Democrat. Or Democrat. With a D.

2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:37.280
 Yeah, and then you use that to mean something. Who knows.

2:08:37.280 --> 2:08:43.920
 Or negative, what, stop Donnie, stop being a socialist or whatever. Whatever that means,

2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:49.520
 that's not even used as any kind of philosophical economic sense. Let's fast forward to

2:08:49.520 --> 2:08:55.840
 today. You mentioned Bernie Sanders. There's another popular figure that represents

2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:01.040
 some ideas of maybe let's call it democratic socialism, and maybe let's try to start

2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:08.480
 sneak up on a definition of what that could possibly mean. But AOC, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez,

2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:11.120
 she's from these parts. Yes, Queens.

2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:21.600
 So maybe if you can comment on Bernie Sanders or AOC, are they open to some ideas in Marxism?

2:09:22.160 --> 2:09:26.560
 Are they representing those ideas well in both the economic and the political sense?

2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:31.440
 Okay. Where do I begin?

2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:40.400
 The socialist movement predates Marx, was always larger than Marx, and has gone on

2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:44.720
 to develop separately after Marx's death. So.

2:09:44.720 --> 2:09:50.800
 Can we pause on that actually? Is there a nice way to delineate, draw a line between

2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:56.080
 Marxism and socialism? Or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism.

2:09:57.120 --> 2:09:57.840
 That's better.

2:09:57.840 --> 2:10:04.960
 Can you speak to like maybe try to define once again what Marxism is and what socialism is?

2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:16.560
 Right. Marxism is a systematic analysis heavily focused on economics. And as I said earlier,

2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:29.040
 devoted to mostly a critique of capitalism. And that's its strength, how it does that,

2:10:29.040 --> 2:10:36.640
 how it poses the questions, how it analyzes the way capitalism works. That is really the

2:10:36.640 --> 2:10:44.800
 forte of the Marxist tradition. Socialism is a bigger, broader tent within which Marxism

2:10:45.680 --> 2:10:51.280
 figures it's there, so that people who aren't Marxist are nonetheless aware of Marxism,

2:10:51.280 --> 2:10:59.600
 like it more or less, study it more or less. But it's a broader notion that I like to use

2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:07.600
 this sentence to describe. It's a broad idea that we can do better than capitalism, that really

2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:16.720
 there are all kinds of things about capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the

2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:24.080
 world think are adequate. And we are in a tradition that goes back to all the people who thought they

2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:28.480
 could do better than slavery and all the people who thought they could do better than feudalism.

2:11:29.680 --> 2:11:35.760
 We've made progress. Feudalism was a progress over slavery. Capitalism was a progress over

2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:43.520
 both of them. And progress hasn't stopped. And we are the people who in a variety of ways want

2:11:43.520 --> 2:11:53.440
 the progress to go further and are not held back by believing that capitalism is somehow the best

2:11:53.440 --> 2:12:00.160
 beyond which we cannot go or even think. We find that to be, in the worst sense of the word,

2:12:00.720 --> 2:12:07.920
 a reactionary way of thinking. And we're that large community. Many of us are not interested

2:12:07.920 --> 2:12:16.080
 in economics all that much. We don't think that's the focal area. We are socialists, for example,

2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:22.400
 because we want to do something to deal with climate change. We think the world is about to

2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:31.200
 kill itself physically. And we want to take steps with other people to stop that, to fix that,

2:12:31.200 --> 2:12:38.400
 et cetera, et cetera. So that's, for me, a kind of difference. It's a little difficult to say

2:12:38.400 --> 2:12:48.080
 because there's no other figure like Marx that has an equal impact, an equal place within the

2:12:48.080 --> 2:12:57.120
 broad socialist tradition. And the only tradition that comes close might be the anarchist tradition,

2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:04.080
 but that's very specialized. And that's a whole nother kind of conversation. And whatever you

2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:12.800
 say, the influence of the great anarchist thinkers, Kropotkin, Bakunin, Sorel and others

2:13:13.360 --> 2:13:20.320
 still doesn't amount to the impact that Marx and Marxism have had so far. That could change,

2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:28.800
 but up to this point, I think that's a way of understanding the relationship.

2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:33.440
 Yeah, that's interesting that some of the ideas within anarchism, and of course,

2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:40.880
 it's one of the more varied disciplines, because there's such, maybe by definition,

2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:50.560
 such variety in their thinkers, but they kind of stand for a dismantling of a power center.

2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:56.800
 And that, if not equates, tends to rhyme with some of the ideas of socialism.

2:13:56.800 --> 2:13:57.680
 Absolutely.

2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:00.080
 So where you have the, you know...

2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:04.080
 There's a whole train of thought in socialist ideas and in Marxist ideas

2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:12.400
 that uses the phrase, quote, the withering away of the state. That's a quotation from Lenin.

2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:21.520
 People should understand that's a quotation from Lenin. And it was made by Lenin, positive.

2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:26.960
 In other words, Lenin was saying, that's a good thing. That's something we stand for.

2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:31.920
 We want to create the conditions under which there is a... Because you remember,

2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:38.160
 the communists or whatever, they wouldn't call that at first in Russia before the revolution.

2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:43.680
 They were just socialists. They were hunted down and persecuted by the government left and right.

2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:48.400
 They had no love for the government. The government was their literal everyday enemy.

2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:55.280
 And being critical of government didn't just mean this particular government,

2:14:55.280 --> 2:15:00.160
 but of the whole... Being a Marxist, you always ask the questions of the social

2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:03.680
 constitution of whatever it is you're struggling against.

2:15:03.680 --> 2:15:07.920
 So there was this interest, why is the state so important?

2:15:07.920 --> 2:15:12.880
 Especially because if you understand feudalism, particularly early feudalism,

2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:17.760
 it didn't have powerful states. One of Lenin's greatest books is called

2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:21.920
 The Economic History of Russia. And he goes back centuries.

2:15:21.920 --> 2:15:26.880
 It's a huge book, three or four inches thick. And I'm one of the few people who've read it.

2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:35.360
 And he's very good about the absence of a strong central government in many parts

2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:39.600
 of feudalism, including inside Russia, but also in other parts of Europe.

2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:46.240
 The development of a powerful central state comes towards the end of feudalism as it is desperate

2:15:46.240 --> 2:15:52.160
 to hold on, which ought to be suggestive, that maybe the turn to powerful governments

2:15:52.160 --> 2:16:00.080
 here in the United States or in Europe is maybe also because this system is exhausted

2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:10.720
 and can't go on and has to marshal every last bit of power it can not to be lost in history.

2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:14.800
 It would be interesting to see what the Soviet Union would look like if Lenin never died.

2:16:16.480 --> 2:16:19.520
 A lot of people have asked that question over the years. A lot of people.

2:16:19.520 --> 2:16:24.160
 The area is stalling, sliding in in the middle of the night,

2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:27.920
 erasing the withering away of the state part. Yes, exactly.

2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:33.920
 So just to return briefly back to AOC and Bernie Sanders, what are your thoughts about these modern

2:16:33.920 --> 2:16:38.320
 political figures that represent some of these ideas? And they sometimes refer to those ideas

2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:44.320
 as democratic socialism. Right. The crucial thing about Bernie and about AOC, and it's

2:16:44.320 --> 2:16:49.840
 particularly true about Bernie because AOC is much younger and Bernie is an older man.

2:16:51.440 --> 2:17:00.800
 Bernie, being roughly my age, has been around formatively as a student, as an activist,

2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:05.520
 then coming up through the ranks in Burlington, Vermont, as a mayor and all the rest.

2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:12.800
 He lived through, for lack of a better term, I would call Cold War America.

2:17:12.800 --> 2:17:16.960
 And the taboo in Cold War America, running from around 1945,

2:17:16.960 --> 2:17:27.200
 six to the present, I mean, it really never stopped, was a Manichean worldview. The United

2:17:27.200 --> 2:17:33.040
 States is good, it defines democracy, and the Soviet Union is awful, it defines whatever the

2:17:33.040 --> 2:17:40.480
 opposite of democracy should be called. Good here, evil there. It was taken so far

2:17:40.480 --> 2:17:53.200
 that even among the ranks of academic individuals, it was impossible to have a conversation. I mean,

2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:58.560
 I can't tell, just make it very personal. The number of times I would raise my hand

2:17:58.560 --> 2:18:07.200
 in my classes at Harvard or Stanford or Yale. And I would ask a question that had something

2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:13.440
 to do with Marxism, because I was studying it on my own. There were no courses to teach this to me,

2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:18.160
 except by people who trashed it, other than that. And I didn't want that.

2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:26.640
 So I would ask a question. And I would see in the faces of my teachers, both those I didn't

2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:32.400
 much care for, and those who were good teachers that I liked, fear, which is just fear. They

2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:37.760
 didn't want to go there. They didn't want to answer my question. And after a while, I got to know

2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:42.560
 some of them, and I found out why. Because you don't know how the rest of the class is going to

2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:47.680
 understand this. Either they would have to say, I don't know, which would be the honest truth for

2:18:47.680 --> 2:18:52.640
 many of them, but a professor does not want to say in a classroom, I don't know, that it's just not

2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:59.760
 cool. Or they'd have to, if they knew, they'd have to say something that indicated they didn't know

2:18:59.760 --> 2:19:05.680
 really much, and they weren't going to do that. Or they would know something. And maybe that would

2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:12.320
 be because they were interested. They did not want the rest of the students to begin to say,

2:19:12.320 --> 2:19:20.240
 oh, you know, Professor Smith, you know, he's interested. It is not good for your career.

2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:25.440
 You don't know how this is going to play out. Who's going to say what to whom. And I could see

2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:31.680
 in their faces what I later learned because they told me, come to my office hours, we're in the

2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:38.640
 office, we can talk about it. But I'm, that's how bad it was. Is it not still? Pretty much.

2:19:39.440 --> 2:19:45.440
 In my field, the great so called debate, I mean, I find it boring, but the great debate for my

2:19:45.440 --> 2:19:52.880
 colleagues is between what's called neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics. Neoclassical,

2:19:52.880 --> 2:19:58.880
 the government should stay out of the economy, less a fair or liberalism. And the Keynesian

2:19:58.880 --> 2:20:04.480
 saying, no, you crazy neoclassical. If you do that, you'll have great depressions and the system

2:20:04.480 --> 2:20:10.560
 will collapse. You need the government to come in to solve the problems, to fix the weaknesses.

2:20:11.200 --> 2:20:15.840
 And they hate each other and they throw each other out of their jobs. One of the very few things

2:20:15.840 --> 2:20:22.480
 they can do together that they agree on is keeping people like me out. That they can find

2:20:22.480 --> 2:20:30.240
 common ground to do. So I had to learn it all on myself. Why am I telling you this? Because

2:20:31.360 --> 2:20:41.600
 this taboo means that all of the complicated developments within Marxism and within socialism

2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:48.960
 of the post World War II period, the vast bulk of all of that is unknown,

2:20:48.960 --> 2:20:55.120
 not just to the average American person, but to the average American academic,

2:20:55.120 --> 2:21:00.880
 to the average American who thinks of himself or herself as an intellectual. I mean, I had

2:21:00.880 --> 2:21:07.280
 had to spend ridiculous amounts of my time explaining Soviet history, have no idea,

2:21:08.480 --> 2:21:13.920
 or saying, does this man Lukach, a Hungarian Marxist, he really had interest in,

2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:21.440
 or to explain that Gramsci was not a great literary critic. He was head of the Communist

2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:28.800
 Party of Italy for most of his adult life. What does that mean? You like Gramsci as a literary

2:21:28.800 --> 2:21:36.160
 critic, but they didn't even know. They don't even know. It's been erased. It's a little bit like

2:21:36.160 --> 2:21:43.360
 stories I've heard about Trotsky and his influence kind of erased in the Soviet Union, because he

2:21:43.360 --> 2:21:49.120
 obviously fell out of favor. And so somehow all of his writings, many of which are very interesting

2:21:49.120 --> 2:21:58.240
 and complicated. Anyway, so what you're going to have in this country is a slow awakening of socialism

2:21:58.880 --> 2:22:05.840
 from a long hibernation called the Cold War. I never expected to be very honest with you

2:22:05.840 --> 2:22:10.240
 that I would live to see. I knew it would come because at least things always do,

2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:16.880
 but I didn't expect to see it. So I have been surprised, as have a lot of us,

2:22:17.680 --> 2:22:20.640
 that when it starts to happen, it happens fast.

2:22:21.200 --> 2:22:30.240
 So you see Bernie as an early sign of the awakening from the Cold War to accept the ideas.

2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:34.960
 Bernie was always a socialist. We all knew. And everybody who paid attention, he denied it.

2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:43.600
 But 2016, he makes a decision, momentous, to run for president. He's just a senator from Vermont.

2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:49.360
 Vermont is one of the smallest states in the Union. People who live in Vermont love to tell you

2:22:49.360 --> 2:22:55.520
 that they are more cows than people in Vermont, etc., etc. So here from this little state,

2:22:55.520 --> 2:23:02.160
 this elderly gentleman with a New York City accent runs for all and says, I'm a socialist.

2:23:02.160 --> 2:23:08.000
 And when they attack him, he doesn't run away. I'm a socialist. I'm a socialist. Now, he had been.

2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:14.880
 It wasn't a secret that suddenly got out. But the great question, and I don't mind telling you

2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:20.960
 because I went to the right schools. I know a lot of people, you know, Johnny Yellen was my class,

2:23:20.960 --> 2:23:26.960
 made it Yellen, stuff like that. So I was speaking with a high official of the Democratic Party,

2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:32.400
 and I said, well, what do you think about Bernie entering the race? Makes no difference. They

2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:39.920
 get 1% of the vote, right? He was wrong. They had no idea what was coming. But the truth is,

2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:45.200
 I didn't either. It wasn't just that he didn't get it. I thought his 1% was probably right.

2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:47.040
 So we were both wrong.

2:23:47.040 --> 2:23:51.120
 Yeah, change can happen fast. Do you think AOC might be president one day?

2:23:51.120 --> 2:24:01.120
 Yeah, possible, possible. But two things. Number one, it's fast. Number two,

2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:11.280
 it's going to go in the following direction, I would guess. You begin with the most moderate,

2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:18.160
 calm, non confrontational socialism you can imagine.

2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:23.280
 So not AOC or Bernie. No, no, they are not confrontational in my judgment.

2:24:23.280 --> 2:24:27.040
 In terms of the ideas of socialism. I mean, they're both very feisty.

2:24:27.040 --> 2:24:34.400
 They're feisty personally. But not ideologically. You know, she is, Bernie is also,

2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:41.280
 you know, in honest moments, and they're both really are pretty honest folks, at least in my

2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:48.640
 experience. In honest moments, Bernie will tell you that his what he advocates as democratic

2:24:48.640 --> 2:24:56.960
 socialism is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s. It was a kind of popular government

2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:03.360
 tax the rich a lot more than you do now to provide a lot more support for the working

2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:10.320
 class than you do now. That's not a fundamental change. That's what he means by socialism.

2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:18.000
 When he talks about it and he's asked for examples, he mentions Denmark a lot. Okay. That's

2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:24.720
 consistent. That's the softest kind of socialism. And that's where we're going to start in a country

2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:30.800
 coming out of hibernation. Pretty soon it's already happening. There'll be people who need and want

2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:36.640
 to go further in the direction of socialism than Bernie and AOC are comfortable with.

2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:44.080
 You can already see the shoots of it now. You know, AOC voted together with most of the others

2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:50.160
 to support the money for Ukraine. Okay. That lot of people in the socialist movement do not support

2:25:50.160 --> 2:25:56.160
 that. And that's going to happen. I don't know exactly how that's going to work out. But that

2:25:56.160 --> 2:26:01.120
 should give people an idea. There are disagreements and they're going to fester and they're going to

2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:08.080
 grow. Interesting. People in the socialist sphere don't support money from the United States in the

2:26:08.080 --> 2:26:13.520
 large amounts that it is being sent to Ukraine. Is it because of, it's fundamentally the military

2:26:13.520 --> 2:26:18.400
 industrial complex is a capitalist institution kind of thing? No. I wonder what the... I mean,

2:26:18.400 --> 2:26:23.600
 there are some people for whom that's the issue. Then there are people for whom this is, you know,

2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:29.520
 it's guns and butter and why are we over there when we have such needs at home that are being

2:26:29.520 --> 2:26:35.520
 neglected. And then there are people who, well, go back to what we talked about at the beginning,

2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:44.880
 who are more like Lenin and Debs. This is a fight between Western capitalism and Russian oligarchs

2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:52.960
 and wannabe oligarchs in Ukraine. And what are we doing here? We have to insist that these forces

2:26:52.960 --> 2:26:58.400
 sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate a settlement, don't kill large numbers of Ukraine.

2:26:58.400 --> 2:27:03.280
 I mean, everybody's willing to fight to the last Ukrainian is a little strange here. What are you

2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:08.400
 doing? You're supposed to be in favor of peace, you know, and for the United States, which just

2:27:08.400 --> 2:27:14.640
 finished invading and occupying Afghanistan and Iraq to be against another country invading. I

2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:20.240
 mean, who in the world is going to take this seriously? This is crazy. You know, I invade,

2:27:20.240 --> 2:27:26.960
 it's good and you invade, it's terrible. What? You know, what are you doing? Why are you doing that?

2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:33.440
 What's going on here? All of these questions are being active, by the way, not just by socialists,

2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:39.360
 by lots of other people too, inside the Democratic Party and also inside the Republican Party.

2:27:40.160 --> 2:27:45.920
 You watch that Tucker Carlson or people like that. They are against the stuff in Ukraine. They

2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:50.640
 don't want the money spent there. They don't want the weapons sent there. They don't like the whole

2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:58.080
 policy and Trump wobble. So, Mr. Biden's policy has got all kinds of critics on the left and the

2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:05.440
 right and every day that this thing lasts, these criticisms get bigger. Anyway, the point is that

2:28:05.440 --> 2:28:16.240
 AOC and Bernie should be, I think, evaluated as the early shoots after a long winter of Cold War

2:28:16.240 --> 2:28:24.960
 or isolation from the whole, you know, when I explain to people the contribution made, for

2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:30.640
 example, to modern Marxism, I'll give you an example, by the French philosopher,

2:28:30.640 --> 2:28:37.200
 Louis Althusser. I don't know if the name means anything to you. Okay. He was the rector of the

2:28:37.200 --> 2:28:43.920
 École Normale Supérieure in Paris. That's the equivalent. Imagine in this country, if there

2:28:43.920 --> 2:28:52.080
 were a university that combined Harvard, Yale, Princeton and MIT, it would be the university.

2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:59.120
 Well, the École Normale in France in Paris is the. He was a tenured professor who became the

2:28:59.120 --> 2:29:05.040
 rector. The rector is like the president of the university, an active member of the French Communist

2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:11.440
 Party, most of his adult life. That was possible in France during the Cold War. That was unthinkable

2:29:11.440 --> 2:29:18.800
 in this country. You could not in a million years, right? So, Althusser, as a philosopher,

2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:29.360
 tried to bring a version of postmodernism into Marxism with enormous impact all over the world,

2:29:29.360 --> 2:29:34.640
 where he traveled, not just in Europe, all over, right? So, if you want to look him up,

2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:46.320
 I'll spell it out for you. A L T H U S S E R. Luis. The Luis is L O U I S. Luis Althusser.

2:29:46.320 --> 2:29:51.920
 Look him up. You'll see tons of stuff. By the way, MIT Press is a major publisher, if I remember,

2:29:51.920 --> 2:29:59.600
 of his works in English. By the way, the textbook I wrote in Economics, in case you're ever interested,

2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:05.440
 was also published by the MIT Press. And the title? Contending Economic Theories.

2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:12.400
 Neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian. That's an MIT. Marxian. Yeah, that's right. And by the way,

2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:19.040
 when we think, I don't know if there's an interesting distinction between Marxian economics and Marxist,

2:30:20.160 --> 2:30:27.120
 I suppose Marxism is the umbrella of everything that's... I only use it because Marxist

2:30:27.120 --> 2:30:35.840
 I use as a noun. A person is a Marxist. Marxian I use as an adjective to qualify, but I don't mean

2:30:35.840 --> 2:30:42.400
 some great different. There's a last point I would like to make about AOC and Bernie. That's also

2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:51.920
 general. I'm a historian too. And I know that the transition out of feudalism in Europe to capitalism

2:30:51.920 --> 2:30:58.320
 was a transition that took centuries and that occurred in fits and starts. So for example,

2:30:59.280 --> 2:31:06.080
 a feudal manor would start to disintegrate, serfs would run away, they'd run into a town. How would

2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:11.040
 they live in the town? They had no land anymore because they had run away from the feudal manor.

2:31:12.400 --> 2:31:16.960
 A deal was struck without the people involved in the deal understanding what they were doing.

2:31:16.960 --> 2:31:24.800
 A merchant would say to one of these serfs, I'm in the business of buying and then reselling stuff

2:31:24.800 --> 2:31:29.920
 and living off the difference. But you know, I could make more money if I produced some of this

2:31:29.920 --> 2:31:36.400
 stuff myself rather than buy it from somebody else. So I'm going to make you a deal. I'm going to

2:31:36.400 --> 2:31:41.760
 give you money once a week. I'll give you money what we would later call a wage. And you come here

2:31:41.760 --> 2:31:47.680
 and under my supervision, you make this crap that I'm going to then sell and this all works out.

2:31:47.680 --> 2:31:57.280
 In other words, there were efforts unconscious, not self aware, to go out of feudalism to a new

2:31:57.280 --> 2:32:04.720
 system. Some of them lasted a few days and then fell apart. Some of them lasted weeks or months

2:32:04.720 --> 2:32:15.040
 or years. But it took a long time before the conditions were ready for a kind of a general

2:32:15.040 --> 2:32:21.360
 switch. And once that was done, it grew on itself and became the global capitalist system

2:32:21.360 --> 2:32:28.880
 we have today. That's the only model we have. So for me, that's what I see when I look at socialism.

2:32:28.880 --> 2:32:37.520
 I see the Paris commune was an event, an attempt. It lasted a few weeks. I see Russia. That was an

2:32:37.520 --> 2:32:43.920
 attempt lasted 70 years. Then I see, and you will fill in the blank, I see these are all early

2:32:43.920 --> 2:32:51.360
 experiments. These are all you learn things to do, learn things never to do again. The good,

2:32:51.360 --> 2:32:57.920
 the bad. What do you build on? How do you learn? And that's what the socialist and Marxist tradition

2:32:57.920 --> 2:33:04.800
 when it's serious, that's what it does. So in your ideas, sort of capitalism was a significant

2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:12.160
 improvement over the feudalism. Yes. And we are coming to an age in overslavery. And we're coming

2:33:12.160 --> 2:33:18.720
 to an age where capitalism will die out and make, it's not that capitalism is how fundamentally

2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:24.000
 broken. It's better than the things that came before it. But there is going to be things yet

2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:30.720
 better and they will be grounded in the ideas of Marxism and socialism. Is there just just to

2:33:30.720 --> 2:33:40.720
 linger briefly on the way Marxism is used as a term on Twitter? There's something called,

2:33:40.720 --> 2:33:47.200
 I'm sorry if I'm using the terms incorrectly, but cultural Marxism or the criticisms of

2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:55.680
 universities being infiltrated by cultural Marxists. Right. I'm not exactly sure. I don't

2:33:56.320 --> 2:34:02.000
 pay close enough attention. No one is. No, no, no. I do. But it's woke. It's, there's a kind of woke

2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:08.160
 ideology that I'm not exactly sure. Right. That's not you. What is the fundamental text?

2:34:08.160 --> 2:34:16.960
 Who is the Karl Marx of wokeness? All I do know is that there's certain characteristics

2:34:17.680 --> 2:34:25.920
 of woke ideology, which is hard lines are drawn between the good guys and the bad guys.

2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:35.440
 And basically everyone is a bad guy, except the people that are very loudly nonstop saying

2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:47.280
 that they're the good guy. And that applies for racism, for sexism, for gender politics,

2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:52.480
 identity politics, all that kind of stuff. Is there any parallels between

2:34:53.680 --> 2:35:00.160
 Marxian economics and Marxist ideology and whatever is being called Marxism on Twitter?

2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:07.200
 No, not much. Mostly Marx, you have to, one of the consequences of the taboo after World War

2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:14.640
 II is that Marxism, like socialism and communism, become swear words. It's like calling somebody,

2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:21.760
 well, I won't use bad language, but using a four letter word to describe somebody. So instead

2:35:21.760 --> 2:35:28.880
 of calling them this or that, you call them a Marxist in many circles. This is even worse than

2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:35.680
 whatever other adjective you might have used, but it doesn't have a particular meaning that I can

2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:42.880
 assess. The closest you get is your little list. It is somebody who is concerned about

2:35:44.640 --> 2:35:52.720
 race and sex and sexual orientation, gender and all of those things and wants there to be

2:35:52.720 --> 2:36:01.280
 transgendered bathrooms and I don't like any of these people. So I slapped the word Marxism,

2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:08.080
 or the phrase cultural Marxism, because it isn't Marxism about getting more money or

2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:15.040
 controlling the industry or all those things that dimly we know Marxists somehow are concerned about.

2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:19.280
 So this is odd since they don't know much about Marxism. I've always been interested

2:36:19.280 --> 2:36:25.440
 in culture. I mean, Lukacs, the man I mentioned to you before, Gramsci, that's what they're famous

2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:32.640
 for, the analysis of what Marxism particularly has to say about culture. Gramsci writes a great

2:36:32.640 --> 2:36:39.280
 length about the Catholic Church, about theater and painting in Italy and on and on. I mean,

2:36:40.320 --> 2:36:43.760
 this is just ignorance talking. They don't know anything about that. They wouldn't know what the

2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:51.280
 names are. It's a label that summarizes kind of a shorthand. I'm against all of this. I don't want

2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:57.440
 to be told that there's ugly racism in this country and it always has been or sexism or

2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:06.560
 phobia against gay people or whatever it is that's agitating them. I mean, Marxism or socialism,

2:37:06.560 --> 2:37:13.600
 I mean, it's just, it's like socialism is the post office. It is, it is a mentality. Well, but I

2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:20.640
 don't blame them. I mean, it's childish. It's mean spirited. But it comes out of the fact no one

2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:27.680
 ever sat them down and said, here is this tradition. It's got these kinds of things that people kind

2:37:27.680 --> 2:37:35.360
 of share and these big differences. Look, an intelligent society, which this country is,

2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:40.800
 could have and should have done that. It was fear and a kind of terror

2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:46.160
 that made them behave in the way they did. And we're now seeing it. Having said that, there is

2:37:46.160 --> 2:37:56.560
 such a thing as cultural Marxism. What that is, is simply those Marxists who devoted themselves

2:37:56.560 --> 2:38:06.960
 to analyzing how it is that a particular culture is on the one hand shaped by capitalism and on

2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:12.480
 the other hand, it becomes a condition for capitalism to survive and grow. In other words,

2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:21.360
 how do we analyze the interaction between the class struggle on the job and attitude towards

2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:30.080
 sexuality or movements in music or whatever else, culture. And there are Georg Lukacs,

2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:36.240
 this Hungarian, great name in there, the greatest of all the names, Antonio Gramsci,

2:38:36.240 --> 2:38:41.920
 and a modern name just died a couple years ago, a British intellectual named Stuart Hall,

2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:47.440
 HALL. You want to, if you want, if I were teaching, which I have done, of course,

2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:55.840
 in cultural Marxism, those would be three major blocks on the syllabus. I would give you articles

2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:03.120
 and books to read of their stuff, because it has been so seminal in provoking many, many others.

2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:08.080
 So there is something to be said and understood about the kind of culture that capitalism creates

2:39:08.080 --> 2:39:14.640
 and the kind of culture that enables capitalism. Yes. And Marxists are particularly those

2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:19.520
 who like to look at that interaction. In other words, they're interested in how capitalism

2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:24.480
 shapes culture and how culture shapes capitalism. There's another name, I forgot.

2:39:25.680 --> 2:39:34.720
 Stuart Hall is British. Gramsci is Italian. Lukacs is Hungarian. The German is Walter Benjamin,

2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:42.800
 B E N J A M I N. He was a member of the Frankfurt School, which is a huge school

2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:48.080
 of Marxism that developed in Frankfurt, Germany, and that has a lot of people,

2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:52.880
 many of whom were interested in cultural questions. It was a bit of a reaction against

2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:58.960
 the narrow Marxism that was so focused on economics and politics. There were people who

2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:05.520
 said, you're leaving out very important parts of modern society that are shaping the economy

2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:12.720
 as much as they are shaped by it. And it was that impetus to open Marxism, to be more inclusive,

2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:18.960
 in what it deemed to be important to understand that this cult, and they call themselves cultural

2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:26.560
 Marxists, but they had a completely different meaning from this. This is just bad malving.

2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:33.600
 That's all. Let me ask a more personal question. So for most of the 20th century, no, not most,

2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:40.080
 but a large many decades in the United States as a consequence of the Cold War and before being

2:40:40.080 --> 2:40:47.440
 a Marxist is one of the worst things you could be. Have you had dark periods in your own life where

2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:56.240
 you've gone to some dark places in your mind where it was difficult, like self doubt, difficult to

2:40:56.240 --> 2:41:01.840
 know like, what the hell am I doing? When you're surrounded by colleagues and people, you said

2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:08.080
 prestigious universities, both personal interests of career, but also as a human being when everybody,

2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:16.160
 you know, kind of looks at you funny because you're studying this thing. Did that ever get

2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:22.400
 you real low? No. I know people who had exactly what you said. I mean, your question's perfectly

2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:28.800
 reasonable. If I were you, I'd be asking me that question too. And what's wrong with you?

2:41:28.800 --> 2:41:35.440
 Nothing wrong with the question. And here's the honest truth. I don't know how anomalous I am.

2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:42.560
 I really don't. But the truth is no, I have, if my wife was sitting here, she'd tell you

2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:48.160
 what she tells me, which is I have been tremendously lucky in my life, which is true.

2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:54.320
 But then again, luck never is the only explanation for things that's part of it.

2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:04.160
 What can I say? I didn't choose the time of my birth. I didn't choose the communities in which I

2:42:04.160 --> 2:42:09.600
 grew up or the schools I attended or anything else. No, but the fact that there was no courses or

2:42:09.600 --> 2:42:15.120
 extensive courses on Marxian economics. But you know, again, I'm haggled. On the one hand,

2:42:15.120 --> 2:42:21.280
 I was denied good instruction. On the other hand, I had to go out and learn it on my own.

2:42:21.280 --> 2:42:28.000
 And the motivation when you do that is very different. I'm not the student who sits there

2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:33.600
 with my notebook, taking notes of what the great professor says and reading the text and getting

2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:41.840
 ready for the exam. I don't have an exam. And I'm doing something slightly risque, you know,

2:42:41.840 --> 2:42:51.920
 kind of romantically different and oppositional. I was able to find always one or two professors

2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:59.360
 that I could talk to outside of the classroom situation, other students who felt enough similar

2:42:59.360 --> 2:43:05.040
 to me that we could get together and read these books and talk about them. I had a number of

2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:13.120
 really fortuitous people who were kind to me and gave me of their time and their effort to teach me

2:43:13.120 --> 2:43:19.200
 along the way. And I've had the benefit that because I went to all these fancy schools,

2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:26.400
 I do know a lot of people who are in high places in this culture. And when I have been put in

2:43:26.400 --> 2:43:32.720
 difficult positions, I often wave my pedigree and it works like garlic with the devil. They're back

2:43:32.720 --> 2:43:40.480
 away. They're back away. Because Americans are very deferential to that kind of academic prestige.

2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:45.440
 But there's a personal psychological thing that seems that you have never been shaken

2:43:45.440 --> 2:43:53.600
 by this. You have just naturally somebody who just has perseverance.

2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:57.440
 Well, I would put it, I mean, I understand what you're saying, but I would put it a little

2:43:57.440 --> 2:44:06.160
 differently. I think capitalism struck me early on in my life as not that great a system.

2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:12.640
 And nothing has happened to change my mind. In other words, the development

2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:26.240
 just kept giving me more and more evidence that this, and I must say over the last 10 years,

2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:33.280
 what's really changed the last 10 years. I mean, I can't describe to you how big that changes.

2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:35.760
 And that may be more important than anything else we've discussed.

2:44:35.760 --> 2:44:44.880
 Up until 10 years ago, I would do a public event, an interview on television or a radio

2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:52.080
 thing or give a talk at some conference or something. Once every two or three months,

2:44:52.080 --> 2:45:00.160
 I'd be invited and I would do like academics often do. I now do two to three to four interviews

2:45:00.160 --> 2:45:08.240
 every day. There's a hunger. Wow, is there a hunger. It's fascinating.

2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:14.000
 And I want to be honest with you. As I say at the end of some of my talks, I allow there to be

2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:20.320
 a kind of a pregnant pause from the podium that I lean into the microphone and I say,

2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:24.880
 with as much smile as I can get, I'm having the time of my life.

2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:34.240
 And that's the truth. I never expected, look, I'm used to teaching a classroom,

2:45:34.240 --> 2:45:40.560
 a seminar for graduate students with eight or nine or 10 students or a regular undergraduate

2:45:40.560 --> 2:45:46.240
 class with 30 or an occasional introductory course with a few hundred. I've done all of those

2:45:46.240 --> 2:45:56.160
 things many times, but an audience that I can count in the hundreds of thousands on YouTube

2:45:56.160 --> 2:46:05.520
 and all of that. No, that's new. Is there advice you can give given your bold and nonstandard

2:46:05.520 --> 2:46:11.920
 career and life advice you can give to high school students, college students about how

2:46:11.920 --> 2:46:17.360
 to have a career like that or maybe how to have a career or a life they can be proud of?

2:46:19.120 --> 2:46:28.720
 Yeah. First of all, my advice is go for it. The conditions for doing that now are infinitely

2:46:28.720 --> 2:46:37.840
 better than they were when I had to do it. And I could do it and I'm happy I did it. Becoming

2:46:37.840 --> 2:46:47.120
 a teacher is one of those decisions I made that I've never regretted. And I've never regretted

2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:56.240
 being a critic of this society. Never. I find it edifying. I find it, I mean, the gratitude

2:46:56.240 --> 2:47:03.360
 people expressed to me for helping them see kind of what's going on is unbelievably encouraging.

2:47:03.360 --> 2:47:07.920
 I mean, what can I tell you? So that feels you. That feels you enjoy. Pointing out that the emperor

2:47:07.920 --> 2:47:14.800
 has no clothes feels you. That's a life not just important. Because most of the people

2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:21.360
 who say something like that to me are people who, if they had the vocabulary and some of them do,

2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:29.520
 would say, you know, I thought I was seeing through that outfit that I was wearing. I thought it

2:47:29.520 --> 2:47:35.920
 and they did. And all they needed was a little extra. This information or that factoid or this

2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:42.560
 logic. Ah, yeah. And they have that. And I remember having that too. When I had a teacher

2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:48.880
 who made something clear that had been murky, I always felt gratitude. And now I get that

2:47:48.880 --> 2:47:56.880
 gratitude a good bit. And yes, it is enormously gratifying. And I'm not sure I could could get

2:47:56.880 --> 2:48:06.240
 it any other way. And I had learned and I'm walking proof that being a critic of society

2:48:06.800 --> 2:48:13.760
 and doing it systematically and sharing it with other people makes for a very good life.

2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:22.960
 Very good life. Speaking of which, however, one other aspect of human nature is that life comes

2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:30.240
 to an end. Do you think about your death? Are you afraid of it? Afraid of it? No. Think about it? Yes.

2:48:31.040 --> 2:48:38.720
 Yes. I'm not afraid. I've always thought, you know, death is hard for the people that are left

2:48:39.520 --> 2:48:47.520
 when you're dead, you know. I worry more about my wife. I'm very attached to my wife.

2:48:47.520 --> 2:48:53.360
 I might mention to you, I got married when I was 23 years old. That's my wife to this day.

2:48:55.760 --> 2:49:02.800
 So I'm lucky because that's, if you get married to anybody at age 23, it's either luck or it isn't.

2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:13.520
 What role has love played in your life? Enormous. Because I came from a family, you know, if your

2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:21.200
 family is political refugees, which mine were, who had to interrupt their lives, moved to another

2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:30.720
 continent, learn another language, find another life income and job and the disruption goes real

2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:40.240
 deep for any refugees. So my mother and father were both refugees. They met as refugees.

2:49:40.240 --> 2:49:50.640
 So I had to, in a way, make it up to them. I had to be, I was the first child of their,

2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:57.920
 I have a younger sister, but I was the first child. And, you know, there's a lot of psychological

2:49:57.920 --> 2:50:04.640
 pressure on you if you're in that situation. Nobody means you harm, but you've got to do

2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:11.520
 what they couldn't, what was shut off to them in a way they want you to do. It's the closest

2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:18.560
 they're going to get to what they had hoped. And my parents were both university students. My father

2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:28.080
 was a lawyer. My mother had to leave the university to run for her life. So I had to perform. You

2:50:28.080 --> 2:50:33.760
 know, I went to high school here in the United States. I had to get all A's. I had to be on the

2:50:33.760 --> 2:50:38.880
 football team. I had to play the violin in the orchestra. I had to do all these because everything

2:50:38.880 --> 2:50:46.720
 had to be achieved. So I'm an achievement crazy person that way. And, but that's functional in

2:50:46.720 --> 2:50:53.680
 this dysfunctional society. But on top of that, that's an achievement within the game of this

2:50:53.680 --> 2:51:00.240
 particular society, but then love seems to be a thing that's greater than that game. Is that

2:51:00.240 --> 2:51:04.960
 something that made you a better person? Oh God. How was it? How was it made you a better

2:51:04.960 --> 2:51:13.520
 Marxian and a better? Everything because my wife, my wife by profession is a psychotherapist. Excellent.

2:51:13.520 --> 2:51:20.000
 I love it. And I needed it. Yeah. And so I married it. I didn't know what I was doing at the time,

2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:25.920
 but I think as I look back on it, that was more than a little what was going on.

2:51:25.920 --> 2:51:33.520
 And she has tutored me all my life about a whole range of aspects of life that my family never

2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:42.480
 talked about, never dealt with, never at least explicitly engaged in any of that.

2:51:42.480 --> 2:51:46.240
 Because it was all about survival. The immigrant challenge is survival.

2:51:46.240 --> 2:51:52.400
 Yes, that's right. Survive, survive. And you're so busy that you tell yourself you can't do that.

2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:57.600
 You, of course, you can. And there are other reasons why you're not going to look at those

2:51:57.600 --> 2:52:04.000
 problems. But the survival is so urgent that you can fool yourself this way. And my parents

2:52:05.040 --> 2:52:11.760
 did that. One last question. What's the meaning of life, Richard Wolff? Why are we here?

2:52:11.760 --> 2:52:15.280
 I will quote you, Mr. Marx. Let's go.

2:52:15.280 --> 2:52:22.080
 No. Life is struggle. And for me, I have found

2:52:23.920 --> 2:52:30.880
 that to be true, that the struggle, whether it is to build a relationship with your child,

2:52:30.880 --> 2:52:37.520
 I have two children, whether it's to build one with your spouse, whether it's to understand

2:52:37.520 --> 2:52:45.440
 a complicated argument and simplify it so that you can share the pleasure of understanding this
