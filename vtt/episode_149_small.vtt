 The following is a conversation with Diana Walsh Basalka, a professor of philosophy and

00:05.280 --> 00:11.920
 religion at UNCW and author of American Cosmic, UFOs, Religion, and Technology.

00:12.640 --> 00:17.280
 This book is one of the most fascinating explorations of the interconnected nature of

00:17.280 --> 00:23.440
 technology, belief, and the mystery of alien intelligence. Quick mention of our sponsors,

 As a side note, let me say, as I did in the recent video on how many intelligent alien

00:47.600 --> 00:53.760
 civilizations are out there, that the nature of alien life, intelligence, and how they might

00:53.760 --> 01:01.200
 communicate with us humans is likely stranger than we imagine, and perhaps stranger than we can imagine.

01:01.840 --> 01:07.840
 What is most fascinating to me is how the belief in the communication with such civilizations

01:07.840 --> 01:14.000
 changes people's understanding of the world, and, as Diana argues, the technology we create.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.400
 Technological innovation itself seems to manifest the mythology in our collective

01:18.400 --> 01:23.920
 intelligence that turns the seemingly impossible into reality, just a matter of years,

01:23.920 --> 01:28.160
 through the belief of individual humans that carry out that innovation.

01:29.120 --> 01:34.720
 The nature and power of this belief in both technology and extraterrestrial intelligence

01:34.720 --> 01:41.200
 is mysterious and fascinating, perhaps holding the key to us humans understanding our own mind,

01:41.200 --> 01:45.680
 our consciousness, and engineering versions of it in the machines we create.

 And now, here's my conversation with Diana Walsh Basalka.

02:02.160 --> 02:08.800
 You are a scholar of religious belief, or a belief in general. So, the fascinating question,

02:08.800 --> 02:15.520
 what do you think is the difference between our beliefs and objective reality?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.640
 What is real, period? Sure, what is real?

02:19.920 --> 02:27.920
 Easy question. So, first let me start with belief. So, belief is generally, there are different

02:27.920 --> 02:32.240
 definitions of belief, just as there are different definitions of what is real.

02:32.240 --> 02:39.280
 Okay. So, for belief in my field, it would be attitudes toward something that dictate our

02:39.280 --> 02:44.720
 actions. Okay. So, we believe the sun is going to rise tomorrow. Therefore, we act as if it will

02:44.720 --> 02:51.040
 rise tomorrow. All right. Beliefs can be wrong. For a long time, people believed, and actually,

02:51.040 --> 02:57.120
 some still do, that the earth was flat. Okay. Well, that's obviously an erroneous belief.

02:57.120 --> 03:02.480
 So, beliefs can be wrong. Now, the bigger question that philosophers ask is,

03:04.160 --> 03:09.920
 is this belief accurate toward what we consider to be objective reality? So, now let me go to

03:09.920 --> 03:17.040
 objective reality. So, what is real? I don't think we can actually obtain a correct understanding

03:17.040 --> 03:21.600
 of what is real. And in that sense, I have to refer to a philosopher again,

03:21.600 --> 03:30.080
 and that would be Immanuel Kant. So, Immanuel Kant is one of the, he was basically in the 1750s,

03:30.080 --> 03:34.080
 he wrote critiques of reason and things like that. So, he said, well, if you're a philosopher

03:34.080 --> 03:39.760
 or have any kind of understanding of Western history, you know who he is. He had this idea that

03:40.480 --> 03:45.040
 we can actually never get to the thing in itself. Okay. So, he called that the

03:45.040 --> 03:50.000
 numinal, the thing in itself. He said, let's take this table, for instance, that you and I are

03:50.000 --> 03:55.680
 talking across. So, this thing is a table. You and I both know that. We assume it's real. We

03:55.680 --> 04:01.440
 believe in it because we put our water on it and our water stays on it. Okay. However, can we know

04:01.440 --> 04:10.320
 this thing in and of itself as a table? So, that would be what he then would call the phenomenal.

04:10.320 --> 04:17.040
 How do we know that that phenomena exists as we know it is? Okay. How do we know? We use our

04:17.040 --> 04:21.600
 faculties. So, we use our senses and things like that. But again, even our senses can be wrong.

04:22.160 --> 04:28.720
 So, I've been on committees just recently, this year, last year, for hiring professors in my

04:28.720 --> 04:34.800
 department who are philosophers and every, and we're hiring metaphysicians and, you know, people

04:34.800 --> 04:39.920
 who are thinking about the nature of reality. And basically, what I've learned from them,

04:39.920 --> 04:45.120
 yeah, they're very... I'd love to attend those faculty talks. I don't know, metaphysics, professors.

04:45.120 --> 04:50.000
 What's funny is that for each one of them, I'm convinced each time. They all say different

04:50.000 --> 04:54.800
 things, but they're so convincing. I'm like, yes, hire that one, right? Is it like historical

04:54.800 --> 05:01.600
 philosophy? No, no. What do they do? No, they have an actual belief. They're practicing metaphysic...

05:01.600 --> 05:08.000
 Metaphysicians. Yes. So, what they do is they come and they're usually excellent philosophers from

05:08.000 --> 05:13.520
 Harvard or, you know, USC or whatever, you know, they come and they give what's called a job talk.

05:13.520 --> 05:19.680
 That's what philosophers... Every academic does a job talk in order to get it. They talk to us about

05:19.680 --> 05:26.000
 a department about what they do. And so, it so happens that we need a metaphysician and now

05:26.000 --> 05:31.600
 we're hiring again for one. And so, I've learned a lot about metaphysics in the last year. And

05:31.600 --> 05:38.560
 this is what I've learned, that they use physics as a basis for understanding what we can know

05:38.560 --> 05:44.560
 about what is real. And what is real is really difficult to pin down. And so, your question is,

05:44.560 --> 05:50.080
 what is belief? Well, belief, does it correspond to reality? That's the question I would ask.

05:50.080 --> 05:54.640
 And first, we don't even know what is real. So, the table, they would say, how do we know that the

05:54.640 --> 05:59.760
 table even exists? Well, how do we differentiate it from the floor, for example? So, these are the

05:59.760 --> 06:04.080
 questions that philosophers are asking. No one else is, of course. But philosophers are asking

06:04.080 --> 06:08.800
 these questions. And they have different answers for it. So, I would say that it's very difficult to

06:08.800 --> 06:16.240
 know what is real. And in fact, what I do usually is I paraphrase my friend and colleague, Brother

06:16.240 --> 06:22.080
 Guy Consulmanio. He's a Jesuit priest. He's also an astronomer. And he's the director of the Vatican

06:22.080 --> 06:28.800
 Observatory. And so, he says this. He's a very smart person. He says, well, truth is a moving

06:28.800 --> 06:36.720
 target. So, basically, to know what is real out there, like gravity or something like that,

06:36.720 --> 06:44.720
 you've got to approximate it. And as human beings, we have senses to tell us what, at least so we

06:44.720 --> 06:49.200
 don't get hurt, we're not going to fall off a building or something like that. We have eyes

06:49.200 --> 06:53.840
 to see and things like that. So, we can approximate what reality is, but we're never going to get to

06:53.840 --> 07:01.040
 it unless we develop better senses, okay? And I think that that is what we are in the process of

07:01.040 --> 07:05.680
 doing. We're developing better senses. We have telescopes. We have microscopes. We have, you

07:05.680 --> 07:11.920
 know, extensions of ourselves, which are now called technology. And we can get to a better

07:11.920 --> 07:17.120
 understanding of what reality is and what the objective world is. And therefore, our beliefs

07:17.120 --> 07:21.680
 can be honed. So, we can get better beliefs, more accurate beliefs. But can we get beliefs that

07:21.680 --> 07:29.280
 actually correspond to reality? Not in any precise way, but in approximate ways. So, I hope that's

07:29.280 --> 07:34.480
 not like too big an answer to your question. What do you think beliefs are in themselves can become

07:34.480 --> 07:42.640
 reality? I mean, so you've now adapted the, in this little bit of a conversation, adapted the

07:42.640 --> 07:48.400
 metaphysician view of reality, which is the physics. Yes. But, you know, we humans kind of

07:48.400 --> 07:54.160
 operate in the space of ideas very much so, like we've kind of in the collective intelligence of

07:54.160 --> 07:59.680
 human beings have come up with a set of ideas that persist in the minds of these many people,

07:59.680 --> 08:04.800
 and they become quite strong and powerful. Like in terms of like impact on our lives,

08:05.360 --> 08:13.520
 they can have sometimes more impact than this table does than the physics. Yeah, I agree. And in

08:13.520 --> 08:21.120
 that sense, is there some sense in which our beliefs are reality, even if they're not connected

08:21.120 --> 08:26.720
 to the physics? Yes, even if they're not real. Yeah, even if, okay, so yes, absolutely. So,

08:28.400 --> 08:36.080
 our beliefs are tremendously, they create social effects, absolutely. There was a belief that,

08:36.960 --> 08:40.960
 I'm going to use this example. There was a belief back in the day, and then we're talking about,

08:40.960 --> 08:44.720
 when I say back in the day, I'm a historian, so I'm talking about like a thousand years ago,

08:44.720 --> 08:50.480
 right, that women had no souls. Okay, so look, I don't know if human beings have souls. I can

08:50.480 --> 08:54.640
 tell you this, though, that if human beings have souls, probably animals do too. That's my own

08:54.640 --> 09:00.400
 personal belief. That's not a professor belief there. But there was this belief among the Catholic

09:01.360 --> 09:06.640
 magisterium, which is runs Europe, that women had no souls. So they had to have this big meaning

09:06.640 --> 09:14.000
 about it. Did women have souls? But that belief had consequences for women. I mean, women were

09:14.000 --> 09:20.320
 treated and have been treated as if they didn't have souls. Okay, so there's... And the soul was

09:20.320 --> 09:25.920
 really the essence of the human being? It was. It's called the animus, right? It's what is the

09:25.920 --> 09:32.400
 essence of what is eternal. Women weren't eternal. Here's another example. Okay, this is an example

09:32.400 --> 09:39.520
 from my own research. All right, so in the Catholic tradition, there's this idea of purgatory, hell,

09:39.520 --> 09:46.480
 and heaven. And these are three destinations that people can go to when they die. And if you're

09:46.480 --> 09:51.440
 great, you go to heaven automatically and you're considered a saint. If you're okay, you go to

09:51.440 --> 09:56.080
 purgatory, right? And you suffer for a time and then get back into heaven. If you're terrible,

09:56.080 --> 10:02.720
 you go to hell, right? Okay. Well, there was a place that the Catholics determined and this was

10:02.720 --> 10:09.520
 a belief for a long time, like a thousand years or more. And it was called limbo, all right? And

10:09.520 --> 10:15.440
 limbo comes from the Latin limbus and it means edge. And it was either on the edge of hell or on the

10:15.440 --> 10:20.000
 edge of heaven. No one really could determine which it was. No historians are like, well, this person

10:20.000 --> 10:25.360
 says it was on the edge of heaven. Well, listen, this was a terrible... First of all, there is no

10:25.360 --> 10:32.880
 limbo anymore. In 2007, Benedict, the then Pope, got rid of the idea that there was limbo. Okay,

10:32.880 --> 10:37.600
 so Catholics kind of went crazy because they didn't really know, they forgot that limbo existed and

10:37.600 --> 10:41.360
 they thought it was purgatory. And they said, how could you get rid of purgatory? But actually,

10:41.360 --> 10:45.840
 he just got rid of this idea of limbo. Oh, so that's a distinct thing from purgatory. It was.

10:45.840 --> 10:50.480
 And by the way, people should know they have a book on purgatory that came before... American

10:50.480 --> 10:55.600
 Cosmic. Yes, I wrote a book on purgatory. Yeah. Anyway, so limbo is a distinct thing from purgatory?

10:55.600 --> 11:05.040
 Yeah. And the types of people who go to limbo happen to be virtuous pagans, okay? Like Socrates

11:05.040 --> 11:12.720
 or somebody like that. And children who weren't baptized. So think of this, think of for like

11:12.720 --> 11:19.760
 more than a thousand years, mothers and fathers gave birth to babies who weren't baptized and

11:19.760 --> 11:25.360
 couldn't be buried with their family in these burial. And then they couldn't be reunited with

11:25.360 --> 11:31.280
 them in heaven. Think of the pain and suffering that that caused. And that was nothing. Limbo's

11:31.280 --> 11:36.960
 nothing. Yet the belief in it caused untold suffering. And that's just a small example.

11:36.960 --> 11:42.160
 And that was as real to them? It was absolutely real. I mean, the effects were real. Let's put it

11:42.160 --> 11:46.720
 that way. The place itself, not real. But the families themselves, do you think they really

11:46.720 --> 11:52.880
 believed it? They totally believed it. As much as the table is real? Yes. I've read... Listen,

11:52.880 --> 11:57.120
 we have trigger warnings today, right? So don't read this. It's going to make you upset, okay?

11:57.680 --> 12:03.200
 History, primary sources, no trigger warnings, okay? So you're going through like, you know,

12:03.200 --> 12:08.960
 somebody's diary from 1400 and you hear the suffering and pain that they went through.

12:08.960 --> 12:14.800
 There were times in my research where I'd have to put my primary source down, you know, and just

12:14.800 --> 12:19.920
 basically go outside and take a walk because it was so horrific. I knew it was true because they

12:19.920 --> 12:23.600
 wouldn't write something, you know, they're not going to write in their diary something that's

12:23.600 --> 12:27.760
 not true. And it was horrible. So yes, these people went through untold suffering for nothing,

12:29.040 --> 12:32.560
 because they had an erroneous belief. But they didn't know it was erroneous.

12:32.560 --> 12:38.400
 So it was real to them? Yeah. So I don't know if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman. He has

12:38.400 --> 12:46.800
 this idea that in terms of the distance we are from being able to know the reality, which is

12:46.800 --> 12:52.160
 there, the physics reality, is we're actually really, really, really, really far away from that.

12:52.160 --> 13:00.000
 Yeah. So like it's, I think his idea is that we're basically like completely detached from it.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.720
 Yes. What's your sense? How close are we to the reality? We'll talk about

13:04.720 --> 13:14.400
 a bunch of ideas about our beliefs in technology and beyond. But in terms of what is actually

13:14.400 --> 13:18.240
 real from a physical sense, how close are we to understanding that?

13:18.240 --> 13:23.120
 Pretty far. I'm going to use examples from what I do. Okay. So this idea that

13:25.200 --> 13:31.200
 we're suspicious of what we actually think is real is not new. Of course, it goes back

13:31.200 --> 13:36.720
 a long time, thousands of years in fact. And philosophers, I'm not actually technically

13:36.720 --> 13:42.880
 a philosopher, but I was one. I'm a professor of religious studies.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.840
 Yeah. What do you introduce yourself at like at a bar when the bartender asks, what do you do?

13:47.840 --> 13:54.320
 I never tell people what I do, especially on airplanes. It's a bad idea. So generally,

13:54.320 --> 13:57.680
 if they push though, I say, you know, I'm the chair of philosophy and religion,

13:57.680 --> 14:03.440
 although I stepped down last year, so I'm no longer the chair. But I have like a master's degree

14:03.440 --> 14:07.360
 in philosophy and I was a philosophy major and I've studied philosophy. I still study philosophy.

14:07.360 --> 14:14.880
 So I integrate it into my research. All right. So this idea that we can't know, we're suspicious

14:14.880 --> 14:19.920
 of what we know, it's called external world skepticism. That's the official philosophical

14:19.920 --> 14:26.960
 name for it. Our faculties and our senses don't give us accurate perceptions of what is there.

14:26.960 --> 14:32.400
 Okay. Especially at a quantum level or a molecular level. I mean, that's just obvious.

14:32.400 --> 14:37.200
 So yeah. So I think that you're, the person you mentioned is correct in that I think we're far

14:37.200 --> 14:42.080
 away from it. I think you're talking about our direct senses, but you know, we have tools,

14:43.120 --> 14:50.560
 measurement tools from microscopes to all the tools of astronomy, cosmology that gives us a

14:50.560 --> 14:56.400
 sense of the big universe and also the sense of the very small. Do you think there's some

14:56.400 --> 15:05.360
 other things that are completely sort of other dimensions or there's ideas of panpsychism that

15:05.360 --> 15:11.520
 consciousness permeates all matter that that's, there's like fundamental forces of physics we're

15:11.520 --> 15:18.080
 not even aware of yet? Like. Oh, absolutely. I do think, and this is why I write about technology

15:18.080 --> 15:25.920
 and I, I mean, that's actually what I specialize in is belief in technology with respect to religion.

15:25.920 --> 15:32.640
 So in my opinion, thank goodness for, thank for technology because where would we be without it?

15:32.640 --> 15:40.000
 I mean, frankly, I think that it's like Marshall McLuhan was the person who said technology is

15:40.000 --> 15:45.840
 like an extension of our senses. And I absolutely believe that to be true. I think that we're lucky

15:45.840 --> 15:51.920
 that we, you know, that Prometheus gave us technology. Okay. And that we use it and we're

15:51.920 --> 15:57.680
 making it better and better and better and better. And that makes us more efficient. It makes us more

15:57.680 --> 16:08.880
 efficient as a species. And like my point is that I think that our instruments, I mean, I don't want

16:08.880 --> 16:16.640
 to be a religious technologist, you know, but our, our, our instruments will save us. I mean,

16:16.640 --> 16:20.960
 they're already making life better for us. You think it's important that they also help us

16:20.960 --> 16:26.640
 understand reality more directly, more deeply? I think directly is better than deeply. I think

16:26.640 --> 16:33.040
 directly, more directly is probably a more accurate term for what you're trying to, I think ask me,

16:33.040 --> 16:37.280
 you know, can we actually, I mean, I think you're asking me that question that Kant basically was

16:37.280 --> 16:42.240
 trying to get at was, can we know the thing in itself? Can we know that? Can we have like some

16:42.240 --> 16:51.520
 kind of like intense knowing of it? It's almost mystical. And I would say that that's where religion

16:51.520 --> 16:58.080
 comes in. Okay. That's where we talk about religion. And if I may also go back to Emmanuel Kant,

16:58.080 --> 17:04.560
 this idea that he just before he died, just as he died, he was working on, he did this critique

17:04.560 --> 17:12.480
 of reason, where basically he believed he, he basically talks about, can we know what's real?

17:12.480 --> 17:16.160
 And he basically has this long, you know, that question, can we know what's real? And then,

17:16.960 --> 17:24.080
 you know, a thousand pages later, no, I'll just give you the rundown. Okay. So, okay. Yeah,

17:24.080 --> 17:29.760
 yeah, exactly. Then he does this other critique. And okay, so he does like three critiques. Then

17:29.760 --> 17:34.640
 he does this critique of judgment. Okay. Well, judgment is this other thing altogether. And I

17:34.640 --> 17:39.280
 think that that's what you're getting at. So, how do we know things? How can we know things

17:39.280 --> 17:45.840
 really intensely and intimately? And I think that he thought that judgment was the idea that we can

17:45.840 --> 17:51.680
 actually know the thing in itself. And he was working on that as he died. And then he never

17:51.680 --> 17:57.920
 finished it. Hannah Arendt, another philosopher of the 20th century, took it up, took up the

17:57.920 --> 18:04.160
 critique of judgment and tried to finish it. Oh, why the word judgment? Because judgment,

18:04.160 --> 18:10.080
 think about it, when you see a work of art, who judges that to be decent? Okay. So there's a,

18:10.080 --> 18:17.520
 there is a group of people who come to the decision that that's rotten, or, you know,

18:17.520 --> 18:21.840
 that's pretty good. You know, like, I noticed that you like to play a guitar,

18:21.840 --> 18:26.800
 where you choose music that I happen to like too. Okay. So you and I both have a, you know,

18:26.800 --> 18:31.280
 a sense of judgment. It's a sense. So he said there's a sense that some people have.

18:32.880 --> 18:39.280
 Why do certain communities have a similar sense? What dictates that? And so he was working on that.

18:39.280 --> 18:43.440
 He said he thought it had something to do with the knowledge, the intimate knowledge of the thing

18:43.440 --> 18:50.000
 in itself. Yeah. So another philosopher that philosophers actually don't like at all,

18:50.000 --> 18:55.840
 but religious studies people do is Martin Heidegger. So Martin Heidegger has some great essays.

18:55.840 --> 19:00.800
 One is called What is a Work of Art? And again, he gets to, you know, he talks about Van Gogh

19:00.800 --> 19:06.000
 and Van Gogh's shoes, you know, that picture, the painting Van Gogh's shoes. It's really,

19:06.000 --> 19:12.160
 a really intense picture. It's just shoes. It's, you know, it's, but it's an amazing

19:12.160 --> 19:18.560
 painting of shoes. And I think everybody can agree. That's a cool picture of shoes, right?

19:18.560 --> 19:22.560
 And so why? You know, the question is, why is that a cool picture of shoes? You know,

19:22.560 --> 19:29.200
 what kind of knowledge are we accessing to determine that indeed that works, right? And in

19:29.200 --> 19:34.880
 fact, we still like it. So basically the nature of knowledge and what does it represent? It can

19:34.880 --> 19:41.520
 operate in the space of, that's detached from reality or can it ultimately represent reality?

19:41.520 --> 19:47.440
 I guess that's the, is that the space of metaphysics? Is that, is that the? Yeah. So what can we

19:47.440 --> 19:53.840
 know is actually called epistemology? Pistemology. But metaphysics is, is basically what is the

19:53.840 --> 19:59.360
 nature of reality? Right. And those intersect? Absolutely. Yeah. A lot of things intersect

19:59.360 --> 20:06.480
 in philosophy. We just have fancy names for them. Another nonphilosopher that may be considered

20:06.480 --> 20:11.920
 a philosopher, since we're talking about reality is Ayn Rand and her philosophy of

20:11.920 --> 20:20.800
 objectivism. What are your thoughts on her sense of taking this idea of reality, calling her

20:20.800 --> 20:29.040
 philosophy objectivism, and kind of starting at the idea that you really could know everything.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.640
 And it's pretty obvious. And then from that, you can derive an ethics about how to live life,

20:36.640 --> 20:43.200
 like what is the, what is the good ethical life and all the virtue of selfishness, all that kind

20:43.200 --> 20:48.960
 of stuff. So you talked to a lot of academic philosophers. So I'd be curious to see from

20:48.960 --> 20:59.760
 the perspective of like, is she somebody that's taken seriously at all? Why she dismissed as I

20:59.760 --> 21:05.760
 see from my distant perspective by serious philosophers? And also like your own personal

21:05.760 --> 21:12.240
 thoughts of like, is there some interesting bits that you find inspiring in her work or not?

21:12.240 --> 21:24.000
 Okay, so Ayn Rand, I've had so many exceedingly intelligent students basically give me her books

21:24.000 --> 21:30.400
 and basically say, please, Dr. Basolka, read this book. And I'll tell them, yes, thank you,

21:30.400 --> 21:34.960
 I've read this book before. And then want to engage in, you know, let me put it this way,

21:34.960 --> 21:42.800
 they're religious about Ayn Rand. Okay, so to them, Ayn Rand represents some type of way of life,

21:42.800 --> 21:49.760
 right, her objectivism. Now, why is she not taken seriously by philosophers in general?

21:50.800 --> 21:58.080
 Well, let me put it this way. Philosophers in general tend to get pretty, I guess you could

21:58.080 --> 22:05.360
 call it, they're kind of scientists, but with words, I always call philosophy, when I describe it

22:05.360 --> 22:10.640
 to someone who's going to take a philosophy class, I say, it's basically math problems,

22:10.640 --> 22:13.840
 like word math problems, okay, so that's basically what it is.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.800
 So they take words very seriously and they're very formal.

22:16.800 --> 22:20.000
 And definitions very seriously, yeah, so they all want to get on the same page,

22:20.000 --> 22:25.200
 so they're not, so there is no confusion. So for Ayn Rand to basically say, you can know everything

22:25.200 --> 22:31.200
 and, you know, and establish ethics from that, I think philosophers automatically say no. Now,

22:31.200 --> 22:38.000
 that doesn't mean I say no. In fact, we even, we have at my university, a wonderful business school,

22:38.560 --> 22:45.920
 and when you walk into the dean of the business school's office, Ayn Rand is everywhere. So it's,

22:47.200 --> 22:53.920
 so I want to say that not all academics are anti Ayn Rand. And in fact, I don't think philosophers

22:53.920 --> 23:00.320
 are either except that they don't teach Ayn Rand. Okay, so in one sense, you could say that because

23:00.320 --> 23:05.840
 they don't teach her, they're being exclusive in what they teach, or very particular perhaps is

23:05.840 --> 23:11.440
 another way to put it. Yeah, it's hard to know where to place people like her because, you know,

23:11.440 --> 23:16.000
 do you put Albert Camus as a philosopher? So I guess what's the good term for that,

23:16.000 --> 23:23.200
 like literary philosophers, or whatever the term is, it's annoying to me that the academic

23:23.200 --> 23:27.520
 philosophers get to own the word philosophy. Because like, it's just like people who think

23:27.520 --> 23:34.400
 deeply about life is what I think about as philosophy. And like, to me, it's like, all right,

23:34.400 --> 23:39.920
 so I know Nietzsche is another person that's probably not respected in the philosophy circles,

23:40.480 --> 23:46.000
 because he is, you know, full of contradictions, full of... I love Nietzsche. Nietzsche is my

23:46.000 --> 23:50.720
 favorite philosopher. Oh, really? Yes, I absolutely love Nietzsche. So he's definitely, you know,

23:50.720 --> 23:54.640
 I love people that are full of ideas, even if they're full of contradictions in Nietzsche.

23:55.760 --> 24:03.120
 And Ayn Rand is also that I'm able to look past the obvious ego that's there on the page.

24:03.920 --> 24:11.280
 And the fact that she actually has, in my view, a lot of wrong ideas. But there's a lot of

24:11.280 --> 24:17.440
 interesting tidbits to pick up. And the same goes with Nietzsche. And I'm weirded out by

24:17.440 --> 24:23.600
 the religious aspect here on both the people who like worship Ayn Rand and people who completely

24:23.600 --> 24:29.920
 dismiss her. I just kind of see as, oh, can we just read a few interesting things and get

24:29.920 --> 24:36.080
 inspired by it and move on as opposed to have a dramatic Ayn Rand. Is there something you find

24:36.080 --> 24:42.400
 about her work that's interesting to you or her personality or any of that? Oh, I think she's

24:42.400 --> 24:50.720
 fascinating. I don't dismiss her. She was a woman who reached a level of success with her mind

24:50.720 --> 24:57.920
 at a time when that was difficult. So I mean, she's definitely worth looking at for even that

24:57.920 --> 25:06.240
 reason. But also, her idea, I guess, part of the situation with Rand, first of all, I think that

25:06.240 --> 25:13.120
 her work is, you have to, it's misinterpreted. Okay. And I think that's the same with Nietzsche.

25:13.120 --> 25:20.960
 Like a lot of people think that, I mean, in fact, it is the case that Nietzsche is writing before

25:20.960 --> 25:28.240
 the 20th century. So he's got that, you know, he's somewhat, his rhetoric is sexist and racist.

25:28.240 --> 25:36.640
 And, you know, of the time period, right? He was a educated philosopher of that time period. However,

25:38.560 --> 25:45.680
 his books are amazing. And Nietzsche's philosophy is incredible. And I think that,

25:46.640 --> 25:51.600
 I think that's what you're saying about Rand, too. And I agree. I mean, I think that, that

25:51.600 --> 25:58.240
 we get caught up, I mean, likely we should, and we should contextualize these thinkers in the time

25:58.240 --> 26:02.560
 period within which they are, we should not forgive their, you know, because there were people

26:02.560 --> 26:09.360
 during Nietzsche's time that were, you know, feminist and not racist and things like that. And,

26:09.360 --> 26:19.600
 you know, so, but each has merit. I mean, I would say Nietzsche is, and you did ask me to talk about

26:19.600 --> 26:24.640
 me to talk about some of the books that made the largest impact on me. And Nietzsche's Gay Science

26:24.640 --> 26:29.760
 is one of them. It's one of the best books ever, in my opinion. I do think Nietzsche was,

26:31.840 --> 26:38.480
 I don't know about exactly sexist, he certainly was sexist, but it felt like he didn't get laid

26:38.480 --> 26:45.440
 much in his life. No. It felt like he was extra sexist. I was like, his theories on women are

26:45.440 --> 26:51.680
 like, all right. He's pretty angry. He seems frustrated. Yeah. It's like, all right, calm down,

26:51.680 --> 26:57.920
 buddy. The fate of philosophers. I just ignore everything Nietzsche says about women.

27:00.560 --> 27:05.760
 So can we, can we talk about myth and religion a little bit? Yes. I mean, can we start at the

27:05.760 --> 27:12.960
 beginning, which is like myths? How are they born? There's this collective intelligence amongst us

27:12.960 --> 27:19.440
 human beings, and we seem to create these beautiful ideas that captivate the minds of millions.

27:19.440 --> 27:26.160
 How is such a myth born? Great question. Okay. So that brings us to terminology again. And

27:27.920 --> 27:34.640
 in my field, we definitely, I think, try not to distinguish between religion. This is going to

27:34.640 --> 27:42.560
 be controversial, I think, between religion and myth, because we call other cultures, religions,

27:42.560 --> 27:49.040
 myths, right? And then we call our myths, religions. And I guess myth has a bad connotation to it,

27:49.040 --> 27:54.960
 that it's not somehow real. Yeah. Now, what's interesting is that people like Plato, who lived

27:55.680 --> 28:02.560
 thousands of years ago, 2,500 about, basically made this distinction himself within his own

28:02.560 --> 28:08.880
 culture, which was Greek, right? So Plato is a very famous Greek philosopher. And he would say

28:08.880 --> 28:17.200
 things like this. He would say that he would make a distinction between the reality of the one God,

28:17.200 --> 28:23.680
 or the one. He would call it, he didn't call, use the word God, but he's referencing a divinity of,

28:23.680 --> 28:31.040
 okay, and he believes in the soul. Okay. So, but he would also say that the gods and goddesses of

28:31.040 --> 28:38.480
 the Greeks are just myths. So even he would make that distinction again. He would say the population

28:38.480 --> 28:44.160
 is not too bright, so they believe in these gods and goddesses. But he himself is talking to his

28:44.160 --> 28:51.680
 students, and he's basically talking about forms. So, that live in, seem to live in these other

28:51.680 --> 28:57.040
 dimensions, like this table, let's go back to this table that we're talking around right now.

28:57.040 --> 29:02.000
 He would say that this table is the instantiation of the form table, and that there's this table

29:02.000 --> 29:06.960
 that actually exists somewhere. It's where this place where numbers exist, like the number two.

29:06.960 --> 29:12.480
 Okay. So, we use the number two mathematically, therefore it exists. But have you ever seen

29:12.480 --> 29:17.600
 a real one? Have you ever seen the real two? No? No. Okay. So, but where does it exist? So,

29:17.600 --> 29:24.000
 he says that tables, so he was also talking about things that, you know, he says are real,

29:24.000 --> 29:31.520
 making a distinction between the people. And by the way, he got this from Socrates, his mentor,

29:31.520 --> 29:36.400
 who was killed by Athens because he would say such things. People don't like to be told that

29:36.400 --> 29:41.440
 they, what they believe in is not real, right? Yeah. By the way, his idea of forms is just,

29:42.080 --> 29:46.640
 he's just making me realize how incredible was that something like that was able to come up with

29:46.640 --> 29:54.560
 that. I mean, that idea became a myth, that the idea of forms, right, that permeated probably the

29:54.560 --> 30:01.200
 most influential set of ideas in the history of philosophy, in the history of ideas. Yes.

30:01.200 --> 30:06.240
 Yeah. I mean, Plato, we know him for a reason, right? Yeah. So, let's say that we're not,

30:06.960 --> 30:11.200
 it's a gray area between religious and myth and maybe not even. It is gray. Yeah.

30:11.200 --> 30:18.720
 Yeah. So, how's that idea with like little Plato start and permeate through all of society?

30:18.720 --> 30:23.520
 Oh, how does it happen? Okay. So, there are different ways that religions work. So, a lot

30:23.520 --> 30:29.760
 of people would call the UFO narrative today, like, and this is what I talk about in my book,

30:29.760 --> 30:34.880
 like a myth, right? The UFO myth. But a lot of people believe in it, okay? So, how do these

30:34.880 --> 30:43.360
 things work? Well, what I did was I took, there's a, Anne Taves at UC Santa Barbara. She's a pretty

30:43.360 --> 30:49.040
 well known academic who studies religion. And she has this building block definition of religion,

30:49.040 --> 30:56.800
 like it builds, okay? And so, she says, there are no religious experiences or mythic experiences.

30:56.800 --> 31:06.480
 There are experiences. And then they get interpreted as religious or mythic, okay? And so, I use that

31:06.480 --> 31:12.720
 with the UFO narrative. So, I take, and I compare it to the religious narrative. So,

31:12.720 --> 31:19.120
 basically what happens? What happens is this, is that a person generally has a very intense

31:19.120 --> 31:24.640
 experience. It could be with something that they see in the sky, a being, you know, that they see,

31:24.640 --> 31:29.200
 you know, like Moses in the burning bush or something like that. They tell other people,

31:29.200 --> 31:34.880
 okay? And those other people believe them because they say, that guy, let's take you. Okay, Alex.

31:34.880 --> 31:40.880
 Okay, so you're playing, you know, some of your music, Jimi Hendrix shows up out of the blue. So,

31:40.880 --> 31:46.480
 Jimi Hendrix, who does electric church stuff, right? The electric church movement. So, he shows up.

31:46.480 --> 31:54.560
 I was, sorry, for a small tangent. I was, I'm not aware of, I apologize if I should be. I'm just

31:54.560 --> 32:00.240
 know how to play all of the songs. Electric church. Is this a thing?

32:00.240 --> 32:03.040
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's Jimi Hendrix's thing. Yeah.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.600
 So, that was like a philosophy of his or what?

32:05.600 --> 32:10.960
 Yes, yes, yes. So, he thought he was, it was like a mission for him, like he was a missionary.

32:10.960 --> 32:16.640
 And he was like doing the electric church. It was through his mission of music that he was

32:16.640 --> 32:21.040
 actually impacting people spiritually. And I think you have to agree that his music is really

32:21.040 --> 32:24.960
 spiritual. Yeah. Wow, that's so cool to know that there's like a philosophy there. Yeah.

32:24.960 --> 32:28.880
 I wonder if he's ever written anything. He's spoken about it many times.

32:28.880 --> 32:33.760
 Interesting. Yeah. To actually do some, some research here. Wow. But as another level of depth,

32:33.760 --> 32:40.560
 that's awesome. Okay, so. Okay, so say Lex is playing. Yeah. One of his songs.

32:40.560 --> 32:45.520
 He shows up. What's your favorite Hendrix song? Oh, that's a hard one. I like Castles in the

32:45.520 --> 32:50.720
 Sand. It's a sad one, but I like it. So, I'm playing something and they show up. Yes.

32:50.720 --> 32:56.240
 And all of a sudden, boom, just like Elvis does for people. Hendrix shows up, all right?

32:56.240 --> 33:00.960
 And then you're amazed and he tells you something that's very, very significant.

33:00.960 --> 33:06.080
 And he says, you need to tell other people this, okay? So, then like, okay. I go on social media.

33:06.080 --> 33:12.880
 Yes. And you start and because people believe you and because you are a person of, you know,

33:12.880 --> 33:18.160
 credibility, people believe you. And so, all of a sudden a movement starts, okay? And it's the

33:18.160 --> 33:22.160
 Hendrix movement. It's Hendrix 2 or something like that. You know, we call it something,

33:22.720 --> 33:28.960
 the next iteration of Hendrix, right? Hendrix lives, but he lives is this vibration and only

33:28.960 --> 33:34.320
 Lex can like, you know, can, can manifest this vibration, okay? So, like, this is,

33:34.320 --> 33:38.320
 this is how religions start, you know, excuse your audience who are religious. I'm actually

33:38.320 --> 33:43.280
 practicing Catholic. So, this is how religions start. They start with, first off, a contact

33:43.280 --> 33:50.240
 experience. Not, I mean, not all of them, but a good portion of them. Some person has an experience

33:50.240 --> 33:55.360
 that's transcendent, sacred to them. And they go and they tell other people. And then those people

33:55.360 --> 34:00.320
 tell other people. And then something gets written about it, okay? And then it becomes,

34:00.320 --> 34:06.080
 because it's a charismatic movement, people become affected by it. And if, if too many people are

34:06.080 --> 34:12.880
 affected by it, an institution steps in and tries to control the narrative. So, this is what you'd

34:12.880 --> 34:19.840
 call the beginning of a religion or a myth, a very powerful myth. And so, it's almost like a star,

34:19.840 --> 34:24.880
 right? A star is born, okay? Yeah. When you say institution, do you mean some other

34:24.880 --> 34:30.480
 organization that's already powerful, doesn't want to become overpowered by this new movement?

34:30.480 --> 34:35.760
 Yes, absolutely. Is this usually governments? It's usually, yeah. So, I have a couple of examples.

34:35.760 --> 34:40.240
 I use the example of the Christian church in my book, because I'm most familiar with the history

34:40.240 --> 34:48.000
 of Christianity. And, you know, Christianity was started by this Jewish man. And it was a movement

34:48.000 --> 34:53.440
 that, you know, he was a very powerful, charismatic person. Other people believed in him. And then

34:53.440 --> 34:59.680
 his followers talked about him. And then other, then, you know, usually early Christians before

35:00.560 --> 35:06.880
 the 300s were generally people who were disenfranchised, because he had a pretty radical

35:06.880 --> 35:12.560
 idea that, you know, humans should have dignity. And this was pretty radical during that time.

35:12.560 --> 35:17.440
 So, women who didn't have dignity and, you know, slaves who didn't have dignity at the time

35:17.440 --> 35:22.800
 and converted Christianity in droves. And so what happened was that all of a sudden,

35:23.520 --> 35:31.120
 it became this belief system that was undercurrent. And then Constantine, who was an elite,

35:32.720 --> 35:38.640
 had an experience and made Christianity to state religion. And by that time, there were different

35:38.640 --> 35:46.240
 forms of Christianity, probably hundreds of them, well, most likely. And Constantine and the people

35:46.240 --> 35:53.440
 who were powerful with him decided that their idea, this is the Council of Nicaea now, decided

35:53.440 --> 35:59.040
 that there was one form, and they called it universal, the one form of Christianity. And

35:59.040 --> 36:04.560
 this should be it. And so they, they kind of took out all the other denominations of Christianity

36:04.560 --> 36:13.120
 in different forms of it. So you can see that a very, very powerful set of beliefs put a culture

36:13.120 --> 36:19.680
 on fire, right? And so how did they, they had to deal with that fire somehow. And so they

36:19.680 --> 36:25.200
 narrativized it. They decided, how do we interpret this? And they interpreted it as they wished.

36:25.200 --> 36:29.840
 But that wasn't the only interpretation of Christianity. I have another example. I'm in

36:29.840 --> 36:38.720
 a Catholic church, a lot of times, and I'm going to use the example of Faustina. She's,

36:38.720 --> 36:45.280
 she's a nun, and she's Polish. And I think it was in the early 20th century, if not the 1800s,

36:45.280 --> 36:54.640
 that she had a very powerful, many experiences actually of Jesus. And she saw Jesus with

36:54.640 --> 37:01.360
 rays coming out of his, his heart. And basically, she called this his divine mercy. And it became

37:01.360 --> 37:07.760
 a devotion in Poland, and it spread. The Catholic church was not, not into this at all. Okay. And

37:07.760 --> 37:13.680
 so they did everything they could to try to suppress Faustina's influence, which was growing,

37:13.680 --> 37:18.880
 and growing, and growing, and growing. Okay. And so they were very successful in trying to keep

37:18.880 --> 37:27.680
 her quiet. And she died. Okay. Years later, John Paul II, Polish, sainted her and created

37:27.680 --> 37:33.200
 the divine mercy devotion, which is worldwide now, and millions and millions of people. But

37:33.200 --> 37:38.960
 do you see how they, they, you know, completely controlled? So fascinating that it, that it

37:38.960 --> 37:44.080
 just starts with a single, like you said, contact experience, experiences, the keyword. And is your

37:44.080 --> 37:52.000
 sense that those experiences are legitimate? So it's not, yes, for the most part, artificially

37:52.000 --> 37:56.160
 constructed? Yeah, I think for the most part, they're legitimate experiences that people have.

37:56.160 --> 38:00.000
 Why would someone want to put themselves through what they go through? Like, why would Jesus want

38:00.000 --> 38:05.840
 to get crucified? I mean, that's a pretty nasty way to die. You know, why would Faustina bring

38:05.840 --> 38:12.080
 this upon herself? The people that I meet who said that they've seen UFOs, most of them don't want

38:12.080 --> 38:17.360
 to be known because of the ridicule that goes along with it. So I honestly think that, you know,

38:17.360 --> 38:23.200
 there are people who are maybe not stable and would like the attention. But for the most part,

38:23.200 --> 38:29.120
 normal people don't want this attention. So you mentioned building blocks. You didn't mention

38:29.120 --> 38:37.520
 the word God or sort of the afterlife. Are those essential to the myth? So there's a contact

38:37.520 --> 38:43.520
 experience. Is there some other aspects of myth and religion which makes them viral,

38:44.800 --> 38:49.760
 which makes them spread and captivate the imagination of people?

38:50.960 --> 38:57.440
 Yes, is there a pattern to them? I think that for each era, it's different. And people have,

38:57.440 --> 39:01.680
 first let's talk about the definition of religion, if that's okay, because most people assume

39:02.560 --> 39:09.040
 the definitions that we in the West are familiar with, which is that, you know, that of Christianity,

39:09.040 --> 39:16.240
 Islam, Judaism, you know, monotheistic religions. And there are, that's not, I mean,

39:16.240 --> 39:20.320
 those are just some religions. There are so many different types of religions. Some religions have

39:20.320 --> 39:28.480
 no God at all. Zen Buddhism, for example, is a religion that asks you to take away your belief

39:28.480 --> 39:33.440
 structures, like to kind of like, in fact, I would call that a Kantian type religion, right?

39:33.440 --> 39:39.360
 And that it's basically telling you to get rid of your concepts of what you think about things

39:39.360 --> 39:44.000
 so that you can actually have the experience like you were talking about earlier of the thing in

39:44.000 --> 39:50.480
 itself. And they call that Satori. So there are people who believe, you know, they try to,

39:50.480 --> 39:57.680
 they call it meditations and meditation. And it's fairly radical, actually, in some monasteries.

39:58.560 --> 40:03.360
 I don't know if they still do this, but they'll whack you on the head if you appear to be

40:05.440 --> 40:10.640
 not focusing and, you know, that kind of thing. You know, they do things to basically take you

40:10.640 --> 40:18.080
 away from your conceptions of reality and bring you into a state of all that is, which is what

40:18.080 --> 40:25.280
 they call Satori. And that has nothing to do with God. I like this religion. And anything that involves

40:25.280 --> 40:30.080
 sticks and whacking in order for you to focus better, I'm going to have to join a monastery.

40:30.080 --> 40:37.040
 So, okay, so that's so digging into definitions of religion. So like, what is, what do you think

40:37.040 --> 40:45.280
 is the scope that defines a religion? Oh, okay. So in my field, we have a few different definitions

40:45.280 --> 40:49.200
 of religion, as you can imagine, just like philosophers have different definitions of what

40:49.200 --> 40:56.160
 is real. So I take this definition, and it comes from John Livingston. And it's religion is that

40:56.160 --> 41:04.480
 set of beliefs and practices that determine, that is inspired by a transformative, what is perceived

41:04.480 --> 41:11.200
 actually to be a transformative and sacred power. Can you say that again? Yeah. So religion

41:11.200 --> 41:15.520
 is a set of, it's not just belief, it's also practices, it's both belief and practices,

41:15.520 --> 41:20.240
 because you won't have the practices without the belief. So you have those together, okay.

41:20.240 --> 41:24.880
 And it's inspired by what is perceived, because we don't know if it's real or not,

41:24.880 --> 41:31.440
 what is perceived to be of sacred and transforming power. So perceived by the followers, or is this

41:31.440 --> 41:36.560
 connected to the original sort of experience? No, no. Well, it's perceived by the followers.

41:36.560 --> 41:43.040
 That's a really good definition. So, and that's the governing idea is that there's something

41:43.040 --> 41:50.400
 of great power. Yes. Perceived to be of great power, which you can connect yourself either

41:50.400 --> 41:55.600
 emotionally or intellectually, somehow, in order to explore the world that is beyond your own

41:55.600 --> 42:03.280
 capabilities. Yes. And is there communication also involved? Generally. Yeah. That's a great

42:03.280 --> 42:10.000
 definition. Okay. So within that falls everything that we've talked about so far, including technology

42:10.000 --> 42:23.040
 and alien life and so on. Do you think ultimately religion is good for human civilization? Let me

42:23.040 --> 42:30.160
 maybe phrase it differently, is what's religion good for? Okay. Yeah. That's a great question.

42:30.160 --> 42:34.960
 Thanks for asking that. Most people don't ask that. And I think it's the question to ask,

42:35.680 --> 42:42.320
 why do we still have religion? That's the question, right? Because scientists and others, scholars,

42:44.080 --> 42:50.960
 humanists even thought that there's this thing called the secular secularization thesis. And

42:50.960 --> 42:58.240
 it's this idea that the more we progress rationally and we have better instruments for understanding

42:58.240 --> 43:03.680
 our reality, the less religious we will be. But that's been found to be untrue. We're still very

43:03.680 --> 43:08.400
 religious. Okay. So why? Why is it around? Well, it's adaptive in some way, in my opinion.

43:09.280 --> 43:15.520
 Many people would not agree with me, but I kind of see it as an evolutionary adaptation. Now,

43:15.520 --> 43:21.680
 think about religions. Okay. Think about Christianity again for one. Here comes this idea

43:21.680 --> 43:27.920
 when you have this ruthless empire called the Roman Empire, which litters its roads with

43:27.920 --> 43:34.400
 crucified bodies to let you know, don't mess with us. Okay. All right. Here all of a sudden,

43:34.400 --> 43:40.640
 you have this guy saying, God is love. Okay. All right. Well, that's weird. Okay. So why?

43:40.640 --> 43:48.000
 Why does this take off? Well, it takes off because we're becoming a colonial power. That

43:48.000 --> 43:55.280
 means we're going into other countries, we're conquering them. We are, you know, how do we

43:55.280 --> 44:02.080
 survive together as cultures that don't clash? Well, we have to have a belief structure that

44:02.080 --> 44:07.200
 allows us to, and I think religions function that way, frankly. So the religions help us

44:07.200 --> 44:14.800
 from us. So the Richard Dawkins meme idea, it allows us to explore a space of ideas.

44:16.560 --> 44:24.720
 And that in itself is the evolution of ideas. And religion is the powerful tool for us to explore

44:24.720 --> 44:39.120
 ideas. Because if I believe that men have souls. Do they? Yes, they do. We're trying to figure

44:39.120 --> 44:45.680
 that out. Well, I still, in terms of souls, do believe cats don't have souls, but we'll never

44:47.760 --> 44:52.720
 be able to confirm that. Maybe if we get better instruments, the soul instrument,

44:52.720 --> 44:57.840
 you need to come up with that one, please. For cats? Yeah, not just for cats, but for all animals

44:57.840 --> 45:03.280
 and people in general. For sure. You can put them in like a little, you know, soul machine and find

45:03.280 --> 45:10.640
 out what's the status of their soul. That's funny. I hope we'll become a scientific discipline of

45:10.640 --> 45:17.200
 consciousness and consciousness is in some sense connected to maybe what the meaning of the word

45:17.200 --> 45:22.960
 soul used to be. And I think it's a fascinating open question, like what is consciousness and so

45:22.960 --> 45:30.240
 on. Maybe we'll touch on in a little bit. But yeah, anyway, back to our. Religions being adaptive.

45:30.240 --> 45:37.920
 I think that Christianity probably helped us become better people to each other as we moved

45:37.920 --> 45:43.680
 into a more global society. And also this, it goes along with my book, which is basically making

45:43.680 --> 45:50.000
 the argument that belief in nonhuman intelligence or ETs or UFOs, UAPs, whatever you want to call

45:50.000 --> 45:58.720
 them is a new form of religion. And how does that work with the scientific method? Do you think

45:58.720 --> 46:04.240
 there's always this role of religion as being in his broad definition of religion as being a

46:04.240 --> 46:10.240
 complement to our sort of very rigorous empirical pursuit of understanding reality,

46:10.240 --> 46:16.400
 where there's always going to be this coupling will always define, redefine new eras of civilization

46:16.400 --> 46:22.960
 of what that religion actually looks like. So you talk about technology and so on being the modern

46:23.520 --> 46:31.120
 set of religious beliefs around that. So is that always going to, is religion always going to kind

46:31.120 --> 46:36.400
 of cover the space of things we can't quite understand with science yet, but we still want

46:36.400 --> 46:41.280
 to be thinking about? Oh, I see what you're saying. That's a great question. When you say religion,

46:41.280 --> 46:47.920
 I would, I would use the word religiosity, because I think that we're moving out of the dogmatic

46:47.920 --> 46:53.120
 types of religions into more of a, I hate to put it this way, but an ex files type religion where

46:53.120 --> 46:58.720
 we can say, I want to believe, or the truth is out there. But we don't know that it's out there,

46:58.720 --> 47:03.760
 or we don't, we don't know yet what it is, but we know it's out there. So there's this, this kind

47:03.760 --> 47:11.120
 of built in capacity for belief and something that we don't have evidence for yet. And that's a

47:11.120 --> 47:17.200
 sort of faith. So I would say yes to that question. Absolutely. I think it's adaptive in that way.

47:17.200 --> 47:21.920
 We're moving into a new, I mean, heck, we've already moved into this culture. Most people have not

47:21.920 --> 47:28.160
 caught up with it yet. I see that in the school systems, you know, and I think that I'm hoping

47:28.160 --> 47:35.760
 we can catch up fast because really it's moving faster than we are. So I mentioned to you offline

47:35.760 --> 47:43.600
 that I'm finishing up on the rise and fall of the third Reich. I'm not sure if you have anything

47:44.240 --> 47:51.040
 in your exploration, interesting to say, but the use of religion by dictators or the lack of the

47:51.040 --> 47:57.040
 use of religion by dictators, whether we're talking about Stalin, which is most secular,

47:57.040 --> 48:03.840
 I apologize if I'm historically incorrect on this, but I believe it's a secular and Hitler. I think

48:03.840 --> 48:10.880
 there's some controversy about how, how much religion played a role in his own personal life and

48:11.520 --> 48:23.040
 in general, in terms of influencing the, using it to manipulate the public, but definitely the

48:23.040 --> 48:29.840
 church played a role. Do you have a sense of the use of religion by governments to control the

48:29.840 --> 48:38.960
 populations by dictators, for example, or is that outside of your little explorations as a religious

48:38.960 --> 48:45.920
 scholar? It's not outside of my framework. Absolutely not. I think that it's done routinely.

48:45.920 --> 48:53.760
 Propaganda is done routinely, especially there's nothing more powerful than religion

48:53.760 --> 49:04.160
 to get people to act, I think. I have, my mother's Jewish and my father's was Roman Catholic,

49:04.160 --> 49:14.000
 okay, from Irish extraction. And so both members, both great grandparents came here under duress

49:14.000 --> 49:20.880
 because they were being, what would you call it? There was an active genocide on both sides,

49:20.880 --> 49:25.840
 being done by other cultures, okay? So on the one hand, obviously we know about the Holocaust,

49:25.840 --> 49:31.520
 okay? So they came, the great grandparents came here to avoid that and they made it. On the other

49:31.520 --> 49:40.080
 hand, there was an English genocide, we just have to say it, of the Irish. It was called a famine,

49:40.080 --> 49:47.520
 but it wasn't fun. It was a staged thing. And so millions of Irish left Ireland on

49:47.520 --> 49:52.000
 coffin ships is what they called them because they usually wouldn't get here. Mine happened to get

49:52.000 --> 49:57.680
 here, okay? So that's the context that I'm coming from. So in each case, for one thing,

49:58.320 --> 50:03.760
 the Irish weren't considered, you know, there was Catholics weren't considered,

50:03.760 --> 50:08.320
 they were considered to be terrible. And there was a lot of anti Catholic rhetoric here in the

50:08.320 --> 50:14.240
 United States, which is kind of strange because one of the, in fact, the most wealthy colonial

50:14.240 --> 50:19.600
 family were the Carols in Maryland and they were Catholic. So when you look at the United States,

50:19.600 --> 50:23.920
 our history, and you see the separation of church and state, do you want to know where that came

50:23.920 --> 50:31.280
 from? That came from those guys. They convinced George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, I mean,

50:31.280 --> 50:38.240
 they couldn't vote, yet they had, they had, they have their names on the Constitution. Is that not a

50:38.240 --> 50:46.000
 strange contradiction? So here you can see how, you know, propaganda works. There was anti Catholic

50:46.000 --> 50:53.200
 propaganda. There was anti Jewish propaganda. And a lot of it was that, you know, these people

50:53.200 --> 50:59.760
 weren't human. They weren't human beings. Another thing I'd like to say is that when the Irish did

50:59.760 --> 51:05.920
 come here, and they were indentured, a lot of times indentured servants. But that's a, that's

51:05.920 --> 51:16.240
 terminology. Then what is an indentured servant? Slave. Pretty much. So in that sense, religion

51:16.240 --> 51:23.360
 can be used derogatorily. Yeah, derogatorily as a useful grouping mechanism of saying this is the

51:23.360 --> 51:29.600
 other. And, you know, it's powerful too, because behind it is a force of, you know, what people

51:29.600 --> 51:36.480
 can tend to be sacred, a sacred force, right? So, you know, it's up to God to, you know,

51:36.480 --> 51:40.960
 decide who's, you know, so you have to go along with what God says, of course. Well, that's

51:40.960 --> 51:47.680
 basically, that's not the contact event. You know, the contact event is usually some type of

51:47.680 --> 51:54.560
 very specific, legitimate event that a person has with something that is nonhuman or considered

51:54.560 --> 52:04.160
 divine. But when religions become narrativized, I would call it by different institutions,

52:04.160 --> 52:08.800
 that's when you're in danger of getting propaganda. You said Nietzsche, one of your

52:08.800 --> 52:15.920
 favorite philosophers. He said famously, one of the many famous things he said is that God is dead.

52:15.920 --> 52:20.640
 Yes. What do you think he meant? Do you think he was right?

52:21.680 --> 52:24.640
 Okay, good. I love this question. No one asks me about Nietzsche.

52:27.280 --> 52:32.880
 And I love Nietzsche. Okay, so first, actually, I do think, and I could be corrected and probably

52:32.880 --> 52:37.520
 will be in all the comments. Yeah. Well, first, Nietzsche, it's true, wasn't the first to say

52:37.520 --> 52:43.360
 God is dead. I think Hegel said it. Okay, no one reads Hegel. He's like so difficult to read,

52:43.360 --> 52:47.360
 that is impossible. Same with Heidegger, as you mentioned. Yeah, I love him, but yeah,

52:47.360 --> 52:52.320
 he's really hard to read. So Nietzsche basically said God is dead. And let me give you the context

52:52.320 --> 52:56.960
 for him saying that. He also said this. He said there was only one Christian and he died on the

52:56.960 --> 53:05.360
 cross. Okay, so he despised Christianity and he said that. And the people who practice it.

53:05.360 --> 53:10.240
 Absolutely. Yeah, but again, he believed in Jesus and he believed Jesus was, he didn't believe he

53:10.240 --> 53:15.200
 was a divinity. He believed Jesus was a good man and he died on the cross. Okay. So he believed in

53:15.200 --> 53:20.960
 the morality. Yeah, he absolutely did. Yeah, he did. And Nietzsche basically was making a

53:20.960 --> 53:26.640
 historical statement about God is dead. He said, and he was right. He was basically saying that in

53:26.640 --> 53:33.600
 this, in the century in which he lived, and he died, I think in 1900. Again, I could be wrong

53:33.600 --> 53:39.600
 about that. So I just want to say that I believe he died in 1900. Okay, so he's writing in the 1800s.

53:39.600 --> 53:45.520
 And he's basically saying, God is dead and we killed him. Okay, so he's making a historical

53:45.520 --> 53:52.320
 statement that at that point in time, with science just kind of getting better and industrialization

53:52.320 --> 54:04.240
 happening, the idea of this thing beyond what we know as material reality is dead.

54:04.240 --> 54:11.920
 So the substrate of Western civilization is dead. That's what Nietzsche is saying,

54:12.560 --> 54:18.880
 if that makes sense. Yes. And he's basically says, with that comes the ubermensch, okay,

54:18.880 --> 54:23.760
 which is the superhuman. And he says, there aren't many of them. He says, but they're gonna come.

54:23.760 --> 54:28.880
 And he also talks about the philosophers of the future. And he's speaking and writing to them is

54:28.880 --> 54:35.600
 my belief. So he's basically telling you and me, because we're now the philosophers of his future.

54:35.600 --> 54:42.400
 Yeah, he's basically telling us, this is what's happening now, and look what it has done. He says,

54:42.400 --> 54:49.360
 now everything is possible, all manner of terrible evil, because no one has the belief

54:49.360 --> 54:54.960
 in God anymore, the belief that there is an afterlife, you asked about an afterlife.

54:54.960 --> 55:00.400
 So with this kind of belief in a morality comes this belief, you know, you can have morals

55:00.400 --> 55:08.080
 without God, okay, people do. But what Christianity is this idea that you will reap what you sow.

55:08.080 --> 55:12.320
 So if people don't believe that anymore, what will happen? And so that's what he's basically

55:12.320 --> 55:19.360
 saying is that the basic anchor for Western society is now gone. Do you think he was right?

55:19.360 --> 55:25.520
 Absolutely, absolutely right. But then again, what do you think if we brought him back to life?

55:25.520 --> 55:31.520
 And he read American Cosmic, your book, and he wrote, he tweeted about it,

55:34.160 --> 55:38.800
 writing a review maybe for the, I don't know what they post for New York Times, he'd be an

55:38.800 --> 55:45.520
 editorial writer with a blue checkmark on Twitter. What do you think he would say about

55:45.520 --> 55:51.760
 this idea that you present that's a grander idea of religion? And, you know,

55:52.720 --> 55:58.560
 like religiosity, like this new form? Yeah, wouldn't that kind of reverse the idea that God is dead?

55:59.280 --> 56:05.520
 Yeah, because it would bring up this idea of external intelligences that are not human,

56:05.520 --> 56:10.640
 which is basically a lot of religions talk about that, right? There are bodhisattvas,

56:10.640 --> 56:16.960
 there are angels, there are demons, you know, there's all these types of nonhuman intelligences

56:16.960 --> 56:23.040
 that religion makes space for. So what I'm basically saying in American Cosmic is these new

56:23.840 --> 56:32.160
 things are within the realm of UFOs and UIPs. So no, I think that, well, I think Nietzsche would

56:32.160 --> 56:38.480
 say that that's a progressive adaptation of religion is what I would hope he would say.

56:38.480 --> 56:44.960
 Nietzsche, however, is unpredictable, I think. I couldn't predict him. So I would say that

56:44.960 --> 56:53.440
 it would be my hope that he would say this is an accurate representation of a move into a new type

56:53.440 --> 56:59.360
 of religion. And it's adaptive, therefore progressive. He would probably be uncomfortable

56:59.360 --> 57:04.160
 reading a book by a brilliant female professor. He happens also to be short.

57:04.160 --> 57:12.560
 I don't know if you read that. No. Yeah. Oh, he said some pretty nasty things about short women.

57:12.560 --> 57:20.000
 Oh, my God. Yeah. Nietzsche, he should be canceled. No, no, please don't cancel Nietzsche.

57:20.640 --> 57:25.520
 You have to take people in the context of their time. Although I'm pretty sure in his time,

57:25.520 --> 57:35.920
 he was also an asshole. He was. But assholes are people too. Okay. Just bad ones. You wrote

57:36.720 --> 57:43.200
 the book, American Cosmic, UFOs, Religion, Technology. What was the goal of writing this book?

57:43.840 --> 57:50.560
 What maybe we'll mention it. We have already mentioned it many times, but in this little

57:50.560 --> 57:57.600
 space of a conversation, can you say maybe what is the key insight that you found that

57:57.600 --> 58:04.160
 lingers with you to this day from the process, the long process of putting this book together?

58:04.160 --> 58:11.360
 Sure. Just like with my book on purgatory, I went into the research thinking that it would be

58:11.360 --> 58:16.000
 something that it was entirely not. It ended up being something completely different. And I

58:16.000 --> 58:21.440
 think that's good. I think that people who do research need to are very excited actually when

58:21.440 --> 58:27.840
 their research surprises them. So I was happily surprised by my purgatory book to learn that it

58:27.840 --> 58:39.840
 was a place. And so I went into American Cosmic being a nonbeliever in UFOs entirely. And I came

58:39.840 --> 58:53.920
 out being agnostic, okay? Kind of believer. But agnostic, sort of open to the mysteries of the

58:53.920 --> 59:02.800
 world. Yes. And I didn't think that, first of all, I knew that the government was part of the

59:02.800 --> 59:10.320
 situation. I just didn't know how much. And so I learned that quickly and acclimated to it,

59:12.160 --> 59:27.200
 accepted it, and noted that indeed, Horatio, the world is much more mysterious than we think it

59:27.200 --> 59:33.920
 is. It's more mysterious. There are more mysteries in this life than your philosophy provides for.

59:33.920 --> 59:41.680
 So is a sense American Cosmic is about the mysteries of the modern life as encapsulated by

59:43.440 --> 59:46.720
 the realm of technology and the realm of alien intelligences?

59:47.600 --> 59:56.400
 Yes. I think that, I mean, I'd have to go off record as a professor and talk personally.

59:56.400 --> 1:00:07.360
 As a person, I do think that there are mysteries of which we have an inkling. And if it's something

1:00:07.360 --> 1:00:15.360
 as powerful as nonhuman intelligence, whether or not it's from another planet, extraterrestrial,

1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:21.840
 or it happens to be from like another dimension or something else, I think that this is going to

1:00:21.840 --> 1:00:28.560
 get the attention of institutions of power. And indeed, I think that's what has happened.

1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:39.600
 And although probably people have had interactions with these things, it appears to me historically

1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:46.720
 for a long time, as long as humans have existed, I would imagine that indeed,

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:53.040
 this is something that's quite powerful and could change the belief structures

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:58.080
 of our entire societies, our civilization, basically.

1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:02.320
 So it's the same way that you're talking, the belief structures were strongly affected by

1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:06.320
 religious beliefs throughout history, in the same way this has the potential.

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:18.000
 So it serves as a source of concern for the powerful because it can have very significant

1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:24.800
 effects on the populace. Is there some broader understanding of how we should think about

1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:33.280
 alien intelligences than like little green men that you can maybe elaborate on and talk about?

1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:39.920
 Yes. This comes directly out of my research in Catholic history. What I found was that

1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:45.520
 let's take, for instance, this idea of an angel. So we all think we know what an angel looks like.

1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:49.920
 Why? Well, we've been told what an angel looks like. We see what an angel looks like. Throughout

1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:54.560
 history, people have painted angels and they all look pretty much the same. But actually,

1:01:54.560 --> 1:02:02.880
 if you go to the primary sources on either in Hebrew or in Greek or in whatever language,

1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:09.600
 and in Latin, and you look at experiences that people have talked about where they've written

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:16.800
 down their experiences about angels, angels don't at all look like what we think. They don't look

1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:26.240
 like little cherubs with wings. They don't look like tall, strong anthropomorphic human looking

1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:33.360
 things. They don't. They look really weird. And sometimes they don't look at all a humanoid. They

1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:41.360
 look like strange spinning things with eyes and things like that. They communicate telepathically

1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:47.680
 with us. So what does that mean for the idea of extraterrestrials or what we consider to be

1:02:47.680 --> 1:03:02.240
 aliens? I'm not the first to say this. If we're in contact with nonhuman intelligence,

1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:10.000
 we're most likely in contact with its technology. Because think about us. Do we send human beings

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:16.720
 to Mars yet? Some people say yes. But let's put that aside. So no, we don't. We use our technology.

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:25.920
 We send our rovers to Mars. So if there's an extraterrestrial civilization, are they coming

1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:30.800
 by themselves? Are they coming to a CS? Or are they sending their technology? Most likely they

1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:35.760
 either are technology or they are sending their technology. Yeah, there might be a gray area

1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:42.480
 between what is technology and what the aliens are. So you're saying basically a robotic probe

1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:48.480
 that would be the equivalent of us, our human civilization created technology? Way more advanced

1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:56.000
 than what we could believe to be a probe, all right? It's kind of funny to think about whatever

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:09.280
 extraterrestrial creations have visited Earth that we're interacting with some dumb crappy drone

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:18.880
 technology. Yeah, it's true. And we're like building these myths and so on from an experience

1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:25.840
 with some crappy drone made by some crappy startup somewhere. That is correct. When the

1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:34.880
 actual intelligence is something much grander. That's the more likely situation. That's what

1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:41.200
 I like to tell people. I'm like, no, it's probably a lot weirder than you think. Yeah. Oh boy. So

1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:50.480
 by what forms can it possibly take? So I really love this idea that I tend to be humble in the

1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:58.080
 face of all that we don't know. And I tend to believe that the form alien life forms would take

1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:06.880
 and the way they would communicate is much more likely to be of a form that we can't even comprehend

1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:16.320
 or perhaps can't even perceive directly. So it could be in the space of, we don't understand

1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:20.560
 most of how our mind works. It could be in the space of whatever the head consciousness is.

1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:31.360
 Like, maybe consciousness itself is communication with aliens or like, I don't know. It could be

1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:40.080
 just our own thoughts is actually the alien life forms communicating. Like, I don't know,

1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:43.840
 all that sounds crazy. But I'm saying like, I'm just trying to come up with the craziest possible

1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:49.520
 thing that doesn't make any sense. That could very well be true. And you can't say it's not true,

1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:54.000
 because we don't understand basically anything about our mind. So it could be all of those things,

1:05:55.200 --> 1:06:01.920
 everything from hallucinations, all the things that are explored through the different drugs

1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:08.320
 that we've talked about in this podcast in general, Joe Rogan wants to talk about DMT and all those

1:06:08.320 --> 1:06:16.560
 kinds of hallucinogenic drugs, all of it, including love and fear, all those things that could be

1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:21.760
 aliens communicating with us, memes on the internet that could be pretty sure humor is alien

1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:28.560
 communication. No, I don't know. But is there some way that's helpful for you to think about

1:06:28.560 --> 1:06:35.680
 beyond the little green men? Oh, absolutely. It accords exactly with how I think actually. So

1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:44.320
 I'll explain. I liked in American Cosmic, I'd attained the status of full professor. So I was

1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:48.480
 like, okay, I can pretty much write this book like I want to do it. And I did. So I used a lot of

1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:54.880
 quotes from cool artists like David Bowie. Okay, so David Bowie opens the book, okay, and he basically

1:06:54.880 --> 1:07:00.240
 says, and so does Nietzsche, by the way, David Bowie and Nietzsche, boom, two, two awesome quotes

1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:03.840
 right together. That's how I open my book. No better opener. Yeah. Do you remember the quotes?

1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:08.160
 Yeah, of course. So the first quote by David Bowie, and that's what I'm going to concentrate on

1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:13.680
 in response to what you just said, which I think is absolutely correct. David Bowie said,

1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:20.080
 the internet is an alien life form. Okay. And if you've not seen David Bowie's interview where he

1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:25.360
 says that, I highly recommend it. He's so brilliant. Okay, so David Bowie is actually quite brilliant

1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:31.440
 about the idea of UFOs. He's also brilliant about the idea of technology. Okay. And most people

1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:37.920
 wouldn't think that. But I mean, he's pretty darn smart. Okay. So all right. So I started to think

1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:44.080
 about it. And I also early on in my research met Jacques Valais. Okay, so he's a technologist. He

1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:49.760
 has a PhD in information technology from a computer science, basically, from Northwestern. And you

1:07:49.760 --> 1:07:53.280
 got that back in the day, you know, when I say back in the day, I'm not talking a thousand years ago,

1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:57.760
 I'm talking like in the sixties. Okay, so he's back when computer science wasn't really even

1:07:57.760 --> 1:08:03.120
 the field. You can get a degree. Yeah, he has a PhD in it. And he's French, he's from France,

1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:08.480
 but he lives in Silicon Valley. And he worked on ARPANET, which is the proto internet. He mapped

1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:12.560
 Mars. He's also an astronomer. I mean, he's just this all around brilliant guy, right? And he's

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:18.800
 also interested in UFOs. And most people take those two interests of his as separate interests.

1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:24.000
 And I remember being at a very small conference and listening to him, being in awe, of course,

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:28.800
 because he's an awe inspiring person. And then thinking, wait a minute, why do people

1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:34.880
 compartmentalize those two things about him? They're one in the same. Okay, so when we talk

1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:41.200
 about UFOs and UAPs and stuff, we have to talk about digital technology and things like that.

1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:48.400
 Now, if we're going back to what I, so if I were to say what, if I were to believe in, and I,

1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:53.440
 like I said earlier, I was agnostic, bordering on belief, most likely a believer in these,

1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:59.040
 this extraterrestrial or not extraterrestrial, let me put it another way, non human intelligence

1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:03.120
 that's communicating with us. I'm going to tell you how I think they communicate with us. And I

1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:09.600
 go back to the Greeks again, okay? And the Greeks had this idea of muses, you know, the muses. So,

1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:14.480
 okay, so there are these things called muses. And we tend to think of them as metaphors, right?

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:19.440
 But what if they're not? What if they're actually non human intelligence, trying to communicate

1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:23.920
 with us, but we're so stupid, we can't like understand, like, so only people with like,

1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:31.920
 you know, in super amazing capacities, like poetic, creative, you know, intelligent,

1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:36.480
 mathematical, whatever, you know, because they tend to do this symbolically, they tend to communicate

1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:41.760
 with us in symbols form. And so music, you know, symbols, we've got math that are, you know,

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:48.720
 it's a symbolic language. And so what, so okay, so muses are probably a good idea for me of what

1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:54.720
 this would be. Now, would muses have spaceships, you know, or those things that we call physical

1:09:54.720 --> 1:10:01.520
 counterparts to what they are? That's another question altogether. But if, you know, I know,

1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:07.120
 why would I think this? Because if you look at the history of our space programs, both Russian

1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:12.000
 and American, you're going to find some pretty weird stuff, pretty weird history there, Alex.

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:18.240
 So you want to get an idea, go back to Chakalsky and read a little bit about what he has to say.

1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:23.520
 If you look back at the history of our space programs, the viable space programs are both Russian

1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:33.040
 and American, and each has an amazingly strange history, because the founders of the calculations

1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:37.760
 that got us up into space, the rocket scientists, basically, were doing some pretty weird rituals

1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:43.840
 and doing religious things, right? They were necessary, like Jack Parsons on our side was out

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:50.720
 in the desert with people like Elron Hubbard and doing really intense rituals, believing that they

1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:54.800
 were opening stargates and things like that. Okay, that's awesome. And they were really doing that.

1:10:54.800 --> 1:11:03.840
 Okay. So then you go to the Russian side, and they had a very specific, non dogmatic according

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:09.200
 to Catholics or Orthodox Christianity, idea of what Christianity was, and they believed that

1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:15.040
 they were interacting with angels, okay, non human intelligences. So if you look back and you see

1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:20.720
 muses, you know, you can contextualize them within this tradition. And so when I started to talk to

1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:26.080
 people who were actually in the space program and who were in these programs that now the government

1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:31.040
 has said, oh yeah, we do have those programs, and they have the same belief structures. They

1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:35.200
 believed that they were also in contact with these non human intelligences. And they were getting

1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:40.640
 what they call downloads of information and creating sometimes with Tyler D in my book,

1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:46.000
 creating technologies that were real. And they were selling them on NASDAQ for, you know, a lot

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:51.200
 of money, like, you know, say $100 million or something like that, undisclosed amounts, but

1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:58.320
 a lot. And these things are viable technologies that we use now and they make our lives better.

1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:03.680
 And we progress as a species because of them. Now, that has nothing to do with the scientific method.

1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:08.400
 As much as I know, as much as anybody's going to get angry at me for saying that,

1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:16.240
 but you know, sorry, those were strange encounters that created our ability to go into space.

1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:20.400
 I don't know if they're real or not, but these people believe they were real.

1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:29.680
 Right. So there's, they have a power in actually having an impact in this world in inspiring humans

1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:33.680
 to create technology, which enables us to do things we haven't been able to do before.

1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:40.640
 And these, I like how we were putting like angels, alien life forms,

1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:49.520
 aliens, and technology all in the non human intelligence camp, which I really like that because

1:12:49.520 --> 1:13:00.320
 this, that's very true. It's this other source of wisdom, intelligence, maybe a connection

1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:04.800
 to the mysterious. Yes. I was really surprised by it.

1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:12.720
 Can you speak a little bit more to the connection between aliens and technology

1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:20.560
 that Jacques Vallée had in his own, one individual mind that's very tempting to kind

1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:30.080
 of separate as two separate endeavors. Why did you come to believe that they are at one in the same

1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:36.720
 or at least part of the same intellectual journey?

1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:42.000
 Thanks for asking that again, because nobody asks me that question. And

1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:50.240
 it's central to my project. So Jacques was a huge influence, is a huge influence on me.

1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:58.160
 He taught me a lot. I had, he gave me access to some of his information that's,

1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:04.480
 that he keeps. But a lot of his information is actually there out there for everyone to read.

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:09.840
 He has an academia.edu page and he just, so he didn't have this. Unfortunately,

1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:16.640
 when I was doing my research in 2012 and 2013, so I had to go back and do microfiche type stuff.

1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:20.800
 You know, what I did was I began to read everything that he wrote and he actually gave me a lot of

1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:26.240
 his books too. And he told me, I remember he dropped me off from, this is actually quite

1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:31.440
 interesting if you'll allow me to tell you a little story. Please. Okay. And it also includes

1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:39.040
 ayahuasca. So great. Every story includes ayahuasca is a great story. Okay. So I was at a conference

1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:44.640
 and it was a small conference of very interesting people in California on the Pacific Ocean.

1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:50.320
 And Jacques was there. And this is actually, it opens my book. This is the book. This is the,

1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:56.080
 I go, I suppress to my book. I go on this ride. He takes me through Silicon Valley.

1:14:56.080 --> 1:15:01.600
 I've lived there, right? My grandparents grew up in the same place that he raised his children in

1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:08.000
 Belmont. And so, but we were there with Robbie Graham, who's a great ufologist in his own right

1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:16.320
 and film theorist. I highly recommend his work. So we were together and he was taking us to San

1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:21.680
 Francisco where I was going to meet my brother who was going to take me home. And so he took us on

1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:28.000
 he took us on this long journey and he talked to us. And as we got out of the car, he gave me

1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:33.120
 several of his books. And one in particular, he gave me, he said, read this first.

1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:39.120
 I was like, okay, I definitely will read that first. Okay. So this is how the ayahuasca figures

1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:45.520
 in. So we were, I didn't take it nor have I taken it. Okay. So we were at this place and

1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:52.400
 in California and Alex Gray and his wife were there and they were talking about their experiences

1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:57.840
 with psychedelics. You know, he's an amazing visionary artist. Okay. So he believes that

1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:03.680
 there's a place that you can enter and he and his wife would enter this space with either,

1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:08.400
 you know, ayahuasca or LSD or something like that. And they would not talk to each other,

1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:13.760
 but they would be having the same exact experience. So they would, it was almost like having the same

1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:22.720
 dream, right? Okay. So somehow that whole event with Jacques there and them talking about their

1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:27.600
 experiences in these realms of which religious studies people are quite familiar, by the way,

1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:33.120
 because visionary experiences are what we study. So all of this seems super familiar to me.

1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:40.800
 And I recognize that immediately that Jacques that it hit me like, you know,

1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:50.560
 very obvious that UFOs and these experiences and technology all seemed, they were all meshed together.

1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:54.560
 And I knew that I had to take them. I knew I had to read everything Jacques ever wrote. And the

1:16:54.560 --> 1:17:00.000
 best stuff he's written, by the way, is his little essays that he wrote in the 1970s and

1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:05.680
 they were pure viewed essays about the beginning of the internet and how a lot of it was based on

1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:14.400
 basically like neural connection with the internet, like somehow psychic connection through the

1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:18.400
 internet with others and things like that. So the mind, the brain is a biological neural network.

1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:23.520
 There's this connection between division neurons and so on. And that's what ultimately is able to

1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:31.440
 have memories and has cognitive ability and is able to perceive the world and generate ideas.

1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:37.360
 And those ideas are then spread on the internet, even from the very early days to other humans.

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:42.960
 So it gets injected or travels into the brains of other humans and that goes around in there

1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:48.480
 and then spits out other stuff and it goes back and forth. So it's nice to think of the network

1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:56.480
 that's in our mind, individual mind as, I mean, very much even deeply connected to the network

1:17:56.480 --> 1:18:02.640
 that is the connection between humans through the internet. And so in that sense, Jacques saw the

1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:12.240
 internet as this powerful, as a source of power and wisdom that is beyond our own. Exactly. That's

1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:17.440
 external to us, like a non, like, you know, if you could call it autonomous AI, right? It's

1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:22.880
 non human intelligence in a sense, even though humans are a part of it. Yes, or we're invaded by

1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:28.000
 it or, you know, whatever you want to call it, okay. Right, it's the chicken and the egg, right.

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:35.760
 So if I can go on, I want to experience things. I'm not done with that. So this is where I come

1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:43.600
 to this idea that we're in this space, we're in now a new space of religion, of religiosity.

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:48.160
 So what happens is then, and it's like a biosphere, and I'll talk about that in a minute.

1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:53.600
 So we, so like, so Jacques takes us back, we get to San Francisco, and my brother,

1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:59.600
 who is your straight lace person, you know, army guy and everything like that, I get into his car

1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:05.040
 and the first thing he tells me is, I took ayahuasca. And I was like, what? And he goes,

1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:12.640
 it's going to save humanity. That's great. Yeah. As I mentioned to you offline, I talked to Matthew

1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:20.960
 Johnson as a Hopkins professor on, he's a really a scholar of most, he's certainly most drugs.

1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:27.120
 He's also really deeply studied cocaine, all those stuff on negative effects. And he's focused

1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:31.520
 on a lot of positive effects of the different psychedelics. It's kind of fascinating. So

1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:41.680
 I'm very much interested in exploring the science of what these things do to the to the human mind,

1:19:41.680 --> 1:19:47.760
 and also personally exploring it. Although it's like this weird gray area, which he's, he's masterful

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:53.200
 at, which is, he's a professor at Johns Hopkins, one of the most prestigious universities in the

1:19:53.200 --> 1:20:00.880
 world and, and doing large scale studies of the stuff. And until, until he got a lot of money

1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:07.600
 for these studies, even in Hopkins itself, there's not much respect, not even respect. It was like,

1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:13.760
 people just didn't want to talk about it as a, as a legitimate field of inquiry. It's kind of

1:20:13.760 --> 1:20:23.200
 fascinating how hesitant we are as a little human civilization to legitimize the exploration of the

1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:28.880
 mysterious of whatever the definition of the mysterious is for that particular period of time.

1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:33.520
 So for us now, there's like little groups of things, like I would say consciousness

1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:39.760
 in the space of like computer science research is something that's still like, I don't know,

1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:46.400
 maybe let philosophers kick it around for a little longer. And then certainly extraterrestrial life

1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:58.000
 forms from in most formulations of that problem space is still the other. It's still the source

1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:04.320
 of the mysterious, except maybe like SETI, which is like, how can we detect signals from far away

1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:12.240
 alien intelligences that we'll be able to perceive. Yeah, it's, and psychedelics is another one of

1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:18.480
 those that's like, we're starting to see, okay, well, can we try to see if there's some medical

1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:25.040
 applications of like helping you get like he does studies of help you quit smoking or help you in

1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:30.480
 some kind of treatment of some disease. And he's sneaking into that. I mean, it's like openly

1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:37.680
 sneaking into it. He's doing studies on it of like, how can you expand the mind with these

1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:43.520
 tools and what can the mind discover through psychedelics and so on. And we're like slowly

1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:48.960
 creeping into the space of being able to explore these mysterious questions. But it's like, it

1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:56.080
 sucks that sometimes a lot of people have to die, meaning sorry, they have to age out.

1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:05.280
 Like it's like, faculty have, and people have a fixed set of ideas, and they stick by them.

1:22:05.920 --> 1:22:13.440
 And in order for new ideas to come in, then the young folks have to be born with an open mind,

1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:18.000
 the possibility of those ideas, and then they have to become old enough and get A's in school

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:25.280
 and whatever to then carry those ideas forward. So, you know, the acceptance of the exploration

1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:35.280
 and the mysterious takes time. It's kind of sad. It is sad. I agree. Maybe to go into my source of

1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:45.760
 passion, which is artificial intelligence. What's your sense about the possibility, like Pamela

1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:51.200
 McCordick has this quote that I like, I talked to her a couple of years ago, or I guess already in

1:22:51.200 --> 1:23:00.560
 this podcast, that artificial intelligence began with the ancient wish to forge the gods. So,

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:11.680
 do you think artificial intelligence may become the very kind of gods that

1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:16.560
 were at the center of the religions of most of our history?

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:24.960
 Yeah, there's a lot there. So, I'm going to start by addressing this idea of artificial

1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:31.360
 intelligence being separate from human beings. Okay. So, I don't think that's actually,

1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:36.880
 that might happen. Okay. I mean, it's already happened, but let's put it this way. Like you're

1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:42.400
 talking about super artificial intelligence, like autonomous conscious artificial intelligence.

1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:45.200
 Okay. Yeah. Something with artificial consciousness.

1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:53.280
 First of all, I think she's correct. Okay. But also, there's an awesome quote. I'd also like

1:23:53.280 --> 1:24:01.200
 to bring up this writer of fiction, actually, Ted Chang. And one of his essays, he writes short

1:24:01.200 --> 1:24:06.080
 essays. One of them was The Basis for the Movie Arrival, which if you haven't seen it, it's a really

1:24:06.080 --> 1:24:15.760
 great movie about UFOs. It has a very creative way of proposing an idea of how they might be able

1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:22.400
 to communicate, first of all, how they appear to us. Second of all, how they may be communicating

1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:30.800
 with us humans. Exactly. The author Ted Chang has a lot. I recommend his writings, his short stories.

1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:40.400
 One is very short, and it appeared in Nature about 20 years ago, and it is called, I think it's

1:24:40.400 --> 1:24:46.480
 called eating the crumbs from the table or something like that. And it's basically this short essay,

1:24:46.480 --> 1:24:53.520
 and I hate to do a spoiler here, but if you don't want to know what it's about, don't listen right

1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:58.800
 now. Yeah. Spoiler alert. Yeah. Okay. So, this is what it's about. So, basically, it's about human

1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:06.720
 beings becoming two different species. And one of them is created, they're called metahumans,

1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:13.280
 and they start biohacking themselves with tech. Sound familiar? So, they do this,

1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:23.760
 and they become metahumans and another species, just kind of another fork. Such that humans

1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:32.160
 can barely understand them because they're so far removed. So, in a sense, are they gods? Right?

1:25:32.160 --> 1:25:36.560
 No, they're metahumans. They're superhumans. They're enhanced humans. Okay. I see that,

1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:42.160
 hopefully on the horizon, frankly. I hope so. Not that we have two species, but that we can use

1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:50.080
 our technology or we can become so integrated with our technology that we can survive. Okay. We

1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:55.600
 can survive the radiation in space. We can't go places now because of the radiation in space.

1:25:55.600 --> 1:26:00.880
 Perhaps we can develop our bodies such that we can survive the radiation in space.

1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:07.520
 So, there's this idea of these metahumans now. There's also this idea that technology is just

1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:14.640
 another form of humans. We've created it, right? And so, maybe it is bent on surviving, thereby

1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:20.480
 using us kind of as a meme or a team. Some people are calling them teams now, these self generating.

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:27.520
 They're replicating themselves through us. Okay. I see that also. And I don't think that's

1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:35.040
 terribly bad. Maybe it's just the way that we are evolving. It doesn't mean that we're evolving

1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:42.560
 all the time. We're taller than we used to be. We have different skills. So, I don't see that as

1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:47.520
 a bad thing. I think a lot of people see it as, if we're not how we are now, it's a tragedy. But

1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:52.480
 it's not a tragedy. How we are now is actually a tragedy for most people alive. Yeah. And we

1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:57.440
 might be evolving in ways we can't possibly perceive. Like you said, that the humans have

1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:04.880
 created Twitter and Twitter may be changing us in ways that we can't even understand now,

1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:09.600
 currently. From a perspective, if you look at the entirety of the network of Twitter,

1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:18.320
 that might be an organism that the organism understands what's happening from its level

1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:24.720
 of perception. But we humans are just like the cells of the human body. We're interacting

1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:29.920
 individually, but we're not actually aware of the big picture that's happening. And we naturally,

1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:38.320
 somehow, or whatever the force that's creating the entirety of this, whatever one version of it

1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:43.200
 is the evolutionary process, like biological evolution, whatever force that is, is just

1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:48.800
 creating these greater and greater level of complexity. And maybe somehow, not other kinds

1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:53.600
 of nonhuman intelligence are involved that we're calling alien intelligences. Yes.

1:27:54.720 --> 1:28:01.600
 So, just to step back, and we'll come back to AI because I love the topic. But through American

1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:05.600
 Cosmic, and in general, you've interacted with much of the UFO community you mentioned,

1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:13.360
 ufologists. By the way, is it ufologists, or is it ufologists? It's ufologists.

1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:18.320
 Ufologists. Yeah. So, first of all, what is a ufologist? And second of all,

1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:25.680
 what have you learned about this community of ufologists, or also as you refer to them as the

1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:32.720
 invisibles, or the members of the invisible college, or just in general, people who study UFOs

1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:36.640
 from the different, all the different kinds of groups that study UFOs?

1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:43.520
 Sure. Generally, what I found is that they are, okay, so people who are interested in UFOs from

1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:48.880
 like being a kid and seeing some cool movie like Star Wars or something, and then they become

1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:56.960
 interested and then they study it. As best they can, UFOs or UAPs, they're generally an honest

1:28:56.960 --> 1:29:03.200
 group of people who are using their tools, and there are generally two types of them. There

1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:07.360
 are those who believe in the nuts and bolts, like the physical craft, and they believe in

1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:12.960
 that these are things from other planets, okay? So, that's like the ETH hypothesis,

1:29:13.840 --> 1:29:20.000
 you know. I'm sorry, ETH hypothesis. ETH is what we call it. Yeah, sorry about that.

1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:26.720
 So, this is like there's an actual spaceship, like something akin, but much more advanced

1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:33.840
 than the rockets we use now. Yeah. And they have some kind of, not necessarily biological,

1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:38.160
 but something like biological organisms that travel on these spaceships.

1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:43.680
 So, this would be like what to the Stars Academy is trying to decipher, like how, you know,

1:29:43.680 --> 1:29:48.400
 how do they do it? You know, maybe we could use that technology, the propulsion and things like

1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:52.800
 that. They look at the rocket technology. Okay, so there are those, and then there are people

1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:58.320
 who believe that it's more consciousness based, okay? So, these are your two types of

1:29:58.320 --> 1:30:04.240
 ufologists who are known, and these are people who we know about. Then I found that there are

1:30:04.240 --> 1:30:11.120
 people who are, quote unquote, I call them the invisibles, because Jacques Velay in the 70s,

1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:17.280
 he and I think actually Alan Hynek, his colleague, quoted, this is a Francis Bacon thing, by the way,

1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:22.560
 it goes back to the early modern time period, when scientists could be killed for basically

1:30:22.560 --> 1:30:29.520
 trying to go outside with the church or the government institution determined was dogma.

1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:33.440
 And so, they had to be really careful. So, he called it the invisible college.

1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:40.880
 So, Hynek took that term and reused it or what do you call it, repurposed it. So, he repurposed it.

1:30:40.880 --> 1:30:45.520
 So, that they were still talking to each other though. So, what I found to be the case was

1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:51.280
 that there was a group of people who were scientists, but were not on the internet, you

1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:57.040
 know, 10 people today and students of mine in particular, and my own kids actually,

1:30:57.040 --> 1:31:01.440
 they think that you only exist if you're on the internet or something only exists if it's on the

1:31:01.440 --> 1:31:06.320
 internet. And that's of course untrue. And so, what I found was that there are most people who

1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:10.560
 are the most powerful people of our society and are doing things are not on the internet,

1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:16.560
 you're not going to find any trace of them. So, a lot of these people are what I call invisibles,

1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:20.960
 people who are studying, at least their work is invisible. You might find them on the internet,

1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:23.840
 but you're going to find that they're part of the bowling league or something like that, right?

1:31:23.840 --> 1:31:30.320
 You will not find that they are actually engaged in research about this topic. And so,

1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:33.920
 I called them the invisibles because I was surprised to find them. And I thought, well,

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:38.800
 this is no longer the invisible college because these people are not even talking to each other.

1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:44.640
 And that's why I reference this movie Fight Club. In it, you have an invisible,

1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:52.400
 okay? And his name is Tyler Durden and he's incredible. He does incredible things. He's like

1:31:53.200 --> 1:31:58.640
 a person who should not exist, right? Because he does so many things that are amazing. And so,

1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:03.360
 I found a person like that and I call, and he's a real person. He's partially on the internet,

1:32:03.360 --> 1:32:08.880
 but nothing that he does around that topic of UFOs is on the internet. So, I decided to call him

1:32:08.880 --> 1:32:16.560
 Tyler D after Tyler Durden. And so, these people, I've turned the UFO Fight Club because they work

1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:21.600
 together, but they don't know. In fact, his boss doesn't know what he does. They don't talk to

1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:26.640
 each other because you know, the first rule of Fight Club. Same as the second, yeah. Exactly,

1:32:26.640 --> 1:32:32.000
 yeah. You don't talk about that. No, you don't do it. Why do you have a sense that

1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:37.920
 there's such a, I don't want to say fear, but a principle of staying out of the limelight?

1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:45.680
 I think there's something real. And I think that the use of it could be dangerous for people.

1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:48.560
 Oh, sorry. You mean like something real, like there's actual

1:32:49.520 --> 1:32:54.160
 technology. I don't know. What's the right terminology here to use? Alien technology,

1:32:54.160 --> 1:33:03.040
 ideas about technology that are being explored, that are dangerous, have made public,

1:33:03.040 --> 1:33:08.960
 that maybe become dangerous, have made public. Yes. So, you don't have to call it alien technology.

1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:14.320
 You can call it ideas about alien technology because I don't know if it's actual alien technology

1:33:14.320 --> 1:33:19.600
 or not. I honestly don't know. But I do know for a fact, because it's a historical fact,

1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:27.200
 that Jack Parsons and Konstantin Tchaikovsky, who's Russian, believed in these things and

1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:31.360
 believed that they were downloading this information. Whether or not they were, I don't,

1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:37.200
 I mean, they definitely created the rocket technologies. That's true. How they did and

1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:41.920
 whether their process was exactly what they said it was, I don't know. So, this is the same thing

1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:48.320
 today. So, we've got some powerful technologies going on here. And of course, we have a military

1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:52.720
 and we have a military for a reason. Almost every government who needs a military has one.

1:33:53.520 --> 1:33:59.040
 And so, they're going to keep these the way they should be kept in my interpretation.

1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:03.360
 I mean, think about it. Everybody accepts the fact that we have a military,

1:34:03.360 --> 1:34:08.320
 almost everybody does. Why are they so upset then that the military keeps secrets?

1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:15.120
 Yeah. Well, that's the nature of things. We can get into that whole thing. I tend to,

1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:23.680
 I've spoken with the CTO Lockheed Martin on this. I've obviously read and think about war a lot.

1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:28.960
 It's such a difficult question because this space, this particular space of technology,

1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:37.600
 there's a gray area that I think is evolving over time. I think nuclear weapons change the game in

1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:43.200
 terms of what should and shouldn't be secret. I think there's already technology that will

1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:48.880
 enable us to destroy each other. And so, there's some sense in which some technology should be

1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:56.560
 made public. This is the same discussion between companies. Which part of your technology should

1:34:57.680 --> 1:35:01.600
 make public through like, for example, academic publications and all that kind of stuff?

1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:05.840
 Like how the Google search engine works, PageRank algorithm or

1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:10.800
 how the different deep learning, there's pretty vibrant machine learning research

1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:15.840
 communities within Google, Facebook and so on. And they release a lot of different ideas.

1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:21.280
 It's an interesting question like, how dangerous is it to release some of the ideas? I think it's

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:27.920
 a gray area that's constantly changing. I do also think it's super interesting. I wonder if you

1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:37.280
 could elaborate a little bit that there's this gray area between what's actually real in terms of

1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:46.160
 alien technology and the belief of it when held in the minds of really brilliant people that they

1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:54.160
 ultimately may produce the same kind of result in terms of being able to create new technologies

1:35:54.160 --> 1:36:03.280
 that are human usable. Like, is there, in your mind, there one in the same?

1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:11.440
 Is like believing in alien craft and actually being in possession of an alien craft?

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:19.280
 I don't think they're the same, no. Belief is powerful, okay? In new age communities,

1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:23.760
 you know, people think thoughts are things, okay? That's been said, you know, thoughts are

1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:29.360
 things. You can make them happen kind of thing, believing them enough. It is true that if I believe

1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:36.000
 I can run a 540 mile, I'll do it, okay? And I probably will do it. And I've done it before,

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:42.960
 actually. I'm much younger, but I did it. But my coach is the one that instilled that belief in

1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:50.800
 me, right? And so, but can I run like a one minute mile? No, okay. So I guess, does that

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:55.920
 answer your question? Like, there's only so far belief goes in generating reality?

1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:01.600
 Well, yeah, I mean, I guess that's what, just having listened to Jacques Valais, it seemed like

1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:09.440
 reality is not, was not as important for the scientific exploration of the concept of alien

1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:14.320
 technology. I could be wrong, but this is what I think Jacques is getting at. There are other

1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:21.760
 ways to access places in reality, other than what we consider to be physical. Right. That's

1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:28.960
 this consciousness. Okay. So in, like I said, so religious studies is among other things. It's

1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:33.920
 looking at visionary experiences. All right. So people do have visionary experiences they did

1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:39.680
 without drugs, you know, they did with drugs, they do with drugs, they do many have them without

1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:46.560
 drugs today. And oftentimes, those visionary experiences correspond to each other. Now,

1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:52.640
 how do we, how do we make sense of that? So, you know, do these places actually exist? In a sense,

1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:58.640
 I think they do. And so I think that, you know, like, let's take that very famous case of a

1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:03.280
 Virgin Mary apparition in Fatima, where I think there was like a lot of people, thousands and

1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:10.240
 thousands, if not like, I think 50,000 or something like that, a lot of people gathered to see what's

1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:16.880
 now called the miracle of Fatima, which was the spinning of the sun. Well, a lot of people saw

1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:21.680
 different things, but they all saw some kind of thing. Okay. So they all saw different things,

1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:32.480
 but it was something happened. Okay. So I guess the question is, what are these places where we

1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:39.920
 access non, what I'd call like non physical realities, okay, where we actually do get information. We

1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:44.480
 did get, like who could say that Jack Parsons didn't get information from doing these rituals and

1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:50.000
 accessing these, we have to say that he actually did, because we see the results of physical results.

1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:55.120
 The same thing with Tyler. And that's why I put Tyler in this camp with this tradition

1:38:55.120 --> 1:39:02.400
 with Jack Parsons. I say that Tyler is getting these, what he calls downloads, and you can see

1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:07.600
 the results of them physically. He sells them on the Nasdaq. He makes millions of dollars from them.

1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:15.600
 They help people. I've seen people who they've helped. Okay. So do you think psychedelics that

1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:26.720
 I just mentioned earlier have a possibility of going to these kind of same kind of places of

1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:34.880
 exploring ideas that are outside of our more commonplace understanding of the world?

1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:40.800
 In my, yeah, I think so. Absolutely. However, I think we have to be really careful about

1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:48.000
 those, because young people or people in general, I should say, absolutely can get hurt by them.

1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.480
 I mean, but we get hurt by alcohol, you know, we drive our cars and we get to kill each other.

1:39:52.480 --> 1:39:59.360
 But psychedelics are really interesting, because I know that within the history of our country,

1:40:00.880 --> 1:40:08.240
 we have used psychedelics in various capacities for our military in order to try to stimulate

1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:14.560
 ideas and access places and information that can't be accessed normally. This is all fact.

1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:20.000
 Yeah. I talked to Matt for like four hours. So we ran out of time being able to talk. Well,

1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:26.720
 I wanted to talk to him about MK Ultra and Ted Kaczynski. There's so many mysterious things

1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:31.360
 there. There's like layers of what's known or what's not known. It's fascinating,

1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:37.920
 but I think what is interesting is psychedelics were used or were attempted to be used as tools

1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:46.400
 of different kinds. That's the point. So like we think of technology as tools to enable us to do

1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:53.040
 things. And that same way that psychedelics, like many drugs could be used as tools,

1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:57.120
 some more effective than others. Absolutely. I don't think what you, I'm not sure what you can

1:40:57.120 --> 1:41:03.920
 do effectively with alcohol. Although somebody, I think somebody commented somewhere on social

1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:11.680
 media that I don't know why everyone gives it's so negative about alcohol, because I think the

1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:19.920
 person said that it's given me some of the most incredible, it enabled me to let go and have

1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:24.240
 some of the most incredible experiences with friends in my life. And it's true. We kind of

1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:29.600
 sometimes say alcohol is dangerous. It can make you do horrible, but the reality is it's also

1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:38.720
 so a fascinating tool for letting go of trying to be somebody, maybe that you're not and allowing

1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:44.320
 you to be yourself fully in whatever crazy form that is and allow you to have really deep and

1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:50.880
 interesting experiences with those you love. So yeah, even alcohol can be used as an effective tool

1:41:50.880 --> 1:42:00.160
 for exploring experiences and becoming, expanding your mind and becoming a better person. So what

1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:07.600
 the hell was I talking about? So yeah, so psychedelics and MK Ultra, is there something

1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:14.400
 interesting to say in our historical use of psychedelics? I mean, think about it. When did

1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:20.160
 we start doing that? When did we start using those? That's true. It's quite a long time ago, right?

1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:26.480
 But okay, but true. But when did our government start experimenting with them with us? Okay.

1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:32.720
 Our government is the United States government. Yeah. Okay. So that happened in around the 1950s.

1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:40.160
 Okay. After quote unquote, the 1940s, where we have 47 and we have, you know, this, you know,

1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:46.160
 this Roswell type stuff going on. Okay. Like crash sites and things like that. So I think that

1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:52.880
 I think there might be a correlation there. I don't know what it is. Okay. But I do think

1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:58.240
 that's fascinating. Actually, yeah, there's a lot of interesting things started around the time.

1:42:58.240 --> 1:43:04.880
 Yeah. Yeah. And so eldest Huxley would say we opened the doors of perception. Okay. And what flew in?

1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:14.320
 Oh, man, that's beautifully put. It'd be interesting to get your opinions on certain

1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:22.800
 more concrete sightings that are sort of monumental sightings with alien intelligences

1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:28.240
 in the history, in the recent history that at least I'm aware of. I'm not

1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:37.040
 very much aware of this history, but the most recent one I've spoken with David Fraver on this

1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:42.560
 podcast. I really like him as a person. He's a fun guy, but also he's gotten a chance to

1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:50.560
 he's described as account of having experience with what he and others now termed the tic tac UFO.

1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:56.160
 What do you think of that particular sighting, which is captivated the imagination of many,

1:43:56.160 --> 1:44:02.720
 in particular, because there's been videos released of it. Yes. Of these UFOs, but I find the videos

1:44:03.360 --> 1:44:10.400
 to be way too blurry and grainy to be of interest to me, personally, to me, the most fascinating

1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:17.440
 thing is the first person to come from David and others about that experience. But what are your

1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:23.520
 thoughts? Those videos have been out for a while, actually, much, I think in the mid 2000s, they

1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:30.400
 were out. But what you have is you have kind of like this corroboration from a group and also

1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:37.520
 the New York Times involvement in 2017. My opinion about the tic tacks is that first,

1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:43.200
 I believe the people who have had the experiences, I know some of them, like some of the radar people

1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:48.880
 and things like that, they saw them and they're not, I don't believe they're making it up. I do

1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:56.320
 think that this is being used as a spin. And I'm just going to say that. And the reason I think

1:44:56.320 --> 1:45:01.680
 that is this is because at the time it was released, I was still in touch with many people who were

1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:07.600
 among the UFO Fight Club. And so they had intimate knowledge of these things. And the first thing

1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:14.400
 they said was, we have satellites that can read the news on your phone when you're reading it.

1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:19.840
 So we've got better footage than this, and this is not good footage at all. Therefore,

1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:26.880
 they believe that it was authentic footage that had been doctored up. Now, why? I don't know why.

1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:33.520
 Okay. So I honestly don't know if it's accurate or not. I mean, I believe the people, absolutely.

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:41.120
 But was this something out there to fool these people? Perhaps, I don't know. Is it spun? The

1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:46.400
 people who I know who are part of the UFO Fight Club believed it was real and said,

1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:52.400
 this is badly done, but real. Okay. I see. But when you say spinning, there's some parties

1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:59.120
 involved that are trying to leverage it. Yeah. For funds, probably. For funds, for financial

1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:07.520
 interest. Yeah, I think so. Nevertheless, it has inspired a conversation and just a lot of people

1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:16.080
 in the world that there's something mysterious out there that we're not fully informed about.

1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:20.960
 And I was certainly grateful that the New York Times ran the story right before my book came out.

1:46:20.960 --> 1:46:27.360
 Well, see, but there's the financial interest that to me, as a person who doesn't give a damn

1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:35.360
 about money, actually, I don't like money, except for when it's used in the context of a company

1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:41.440
 to build cool things. But like personally, I don't know, I find the financial interest side

1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:47.520
 off putting, especially when we're talking about the exploration of some of the most,

1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:51.840
 like money is a silly creation of human beings. I agree.

1:46:53.360 --> 1:47:02.160
 And it's used to provide temporary, like the unfortunate thing with money is that it helps

1:47:02.160 --> 1:47:11.360
 you buy things that too easily allow you to forget the important things in life and also to forget

1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:16.320
 the difficult aspects of life to do the difficult intellectual work of being cognizant of your

1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:25.040
 mortality of like fully engaging in life, in life of reason to of thinking deeply about the world,

1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:28.960
 all those kinds of things. If you get like a nice car or something like that, and just like,

1:47:29.680 --> 1:47:34.240
 I don't know, all the different things you could do with money is it can make you forget that.

1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:40.640
 Anyway, as there's a long way to say that, yes, yes, it's very nice that you coincided nicely

1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:48.400
 with the book. But also it, I think it, I mean, like I said, I think it inspired quite a lot of

1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:53.520
 people that, you know, maybe there's a lot of things out there that were like, it reminded a

1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:58.320
 lot of people, there's things out there we don't know about. Lex, I can agree with you on that.

1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:04.160
 But can I push back on two things? Okay, all right. The first one is that I was happy to receive

1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:09.840
 money from the book because of the New York Times article. That's absolutely false. So I

1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:15.280
 published my book with Oxford, which is an academic press, and you don't get paid with an academic

1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:20.800
 press. Okay, so money was not it for me. What it was was recognition that my research was being

1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:25.600
 validated. So, you know, because then people called me and said, well, maybe it's more than

1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:30.880
 interesting. Okay, and they did. Okay, the other thing about money is just as you say that,

1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:37.440
 now I agree with you, there, I'm upset about money too. I think there should be universal

1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:42.080
 health care, universal income. You know, I don't think people should be in poverty, especially

1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:50.000
 because we are so wealthy as a species, frankly. Okay, that said, think about this. If you are,

1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:56.240
 if you don't have money, you can't have a life of the mind either, right? 100%. So I'm not espousing

1:48:56.240 --> 1:49:05.840
 that like money's the devil. I just think that there's money can be a drug or I will compare it

1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:11.600
 to like food or something like that, where like, you really should have enough to nourish yourself.

1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:18.800
 Yes. Right. And too much could and too much can be a huge problem. So that's where I come from

1:49:18.800 --> 1:49:24.160
 with the money. And I'm just aware I'm fortunate enough to have the skills and the health to be

1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:30.160
 able to earn a living in whatever way, like I wish of him being in the United States and being able

1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:36.160
 to speak English. So the very least I could work with McDonald's and my standards are, I told Joe,

1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:43.360
 I mean, mistake, I told Joe Rogan that I've always had a few money and people are like, oh,

1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:49.840
 Lex was always rich. No, no, no, I was always broke. What I mean by I've always had a few

1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:56.320
 monies. My standard, what it takes to have a few is always very little. I'm just happy with

1:49:56.320 --> 1:50:03.520
 very little. But yes, it's true that money for many people and included for myself, it's just

1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:10.400
 a different level for different people is freedom. Yes. Freedom to think, freedom to do, pursue your

1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:18.080
 passions. It just so happens. I am very fortunate that many of my passions often come with a salary

1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:27.840
 if I wished. I love programming. So even just working as a basic level software engineer

1:50:27.840 --> 1:50:34.240
 will be a source of a lot of joy for me. And that happens in this modern world to come with a salary.

1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:40.560
 So yeah, it's definitely true. I just mean that it can become a dangerous drug. So I'm glad you

1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:49.840
 are in this pursuit that you are in for the love of knowledge. And it's true. People should definitely

1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:56.560
 buy your book. I won't be making money off of it. Oh, yeah, this rocks. Yeah, absolutely. Maybe my

1:50:56.560 --> 1:51:07.040
 next book. Yes. Yeah, your sense is there's something as there's some groups of people that

1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:13.920
 maybe try to leverage this for financial gains. And you know, probably good financial. I mean,

1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:19.840
 they may have good reasons for this too. Like, okay, let's take the study of UFOs. Okay, maybe many

1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:26.000
 people in government that decide who dole out the money, let's put it that way, they think UFOs

1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:30.640
 aren't real. So they're not going to give these programs money. So how do these programs make

1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:36.560
 money? They're going to have to find a way to do it. So maybe that's how they do it. Okay, so

1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:43.520
 that's fascinating. This is a way to raise money for doing the research. Yeah, I think so.

1:51:44.880 --> 1:51:50.400
 So let's take a step back to Roswell. We talked about a little bit. What's your sense about that

1:51:50.400 --> 1:52:00.240
 whole time? Roswell and just Area 51 and the sightings and also the follow on mythology around

1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:08.640
 those sightings. That's with us today. All right. So where do I get started? Well, I mean, it is

1:52:08.640 --> 1:52:14.480
 a mythology here, right? The mythology of Roswell, it's very religious, like in the sense that there's

1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:20.480
 a pilgrimage to Roswell people make. And they go to, there's a festival there as well, like a

1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:26.000
 religious festival. You can get little kitschy stuff, like you can get at a religious festival

1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:31.760
 there. So it's very much like a place of pilgrimage where a herophany occurred. And a herophany is

1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:37.760
 basically contact with nonhuman intelligence. Okay, so nonhuman intelligence is thought to have

1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:43.760
 contacted humans or crashed at this place in Roswell, New Mexico. Now, what's fascinating is

1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:51.600
 that I begin my book by going out to a crash site in New Mexico. I have to get blindfolded with my,

1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:58.400
 well, to tell you the truth, the story is that I'm with Tyler, who's an invisible, and he wants to

1:52:58.400 --> 1:53:04.400
 show me a place in New Mexico where a crash happened. And he says that he thinks that I need

1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:09.680
 to see physical evidence because I don't believe. And so I said, I'll go, but I'm going to bring

1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:14.560
 a friend of mine. And he said, no, you have to go alone. He goes, it's a place that is on

1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:21.520
 government owned property. And it's a no fly zone. And when you go, you'll be blindfolded. And I said,

1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:29.280
 I definitely need to bring a friend. So he said, well, who do you want to bring? I just had met

1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:35.520
 this university scientist, he's very well known. And I call him James in my book. And I asked, and

1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:40.240
 I had a feeling James would definitely want to do this. And I asked James and he said, I'll go

1:53:40.240 --> 1:53:47.520
 tomorrow. Okay. So I suggested this to Tyler and Tyler said, absolutely not. And I thought,

1:53:47.520 --> 1:53:52.720
 I know he's going to look up James and he's going to say yes. Because if anybody can figure out what

1:53:52.720 --> 1:53:57.440
 this material is that we're going to go look for, it's going to be James. He has the instruments.

1:53:57.440 --> 1:54:03.760
 And so Tyler did, in fact, look him up and finally said, okay, I got, you can go. So we both head

1:54:03.760 --> 1:54:09.040
 out there and we get blindfolded and Tyler takes us out there. It takes about 40 minutes. I was

1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:14.080
 outside of a certain place in New Mexico. So in terms of Roswell, this is what I can say,

1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:20.960
 is that according to Tyler, there were about seven crashes out in the 1940s in New Mexico,

1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:29.760
 in different various places. We went to one of them according to Tyler. At the time, I was

1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:34.720
 completely an atheist with regard to anything that had to do with UFOs. So we were out there,

1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:43.760
 we had specially configured metal detectors for these metals. And we did find these. Okay.

1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:48.560
 And they've since been studied by various scientists, material scientists, so forth.

1:54:49.200 --> 1:54:57.120
 And I believe Jacques talked about not those particular ones, but others on the Joe Rogan

1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:05.360
 show. They're anomalies. So there are scientists don't, I'm not a scientist. So I can't weigh in

1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:10.720
 on whether I just, I just believe the people, these people I believe because they're

1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:14.480
 well known scientists. What do you mean they're not anomalies? So the

1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:20.000
 No, they are not, they are not anomalous. Oh, anomalous in terms of the materials that

1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:28.720
 are naturally occurring on earth. Yes. Okay. So that, so there's some kind of

1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:38.160
 inklings of evidence that, that something happened in Roswell, in terms of crashes

1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:43.280
 of alien technology. Now, what else is there to the mythology? So there's some

1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:52.000
 some, some crashes, right? Yeah. I mean, that's kind of epic. It's pretty epic. Yeah. And what

1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:58.000
 else? Like what, what are we supposed to take away from this? Right. Yeah. So it's weird. Okay.

1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:03.440
 So there's this, okay. So in religious studies, like I said, we call it a herophany, which is

1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:09.360
 the meeting of a non human intelligent thing, whatever it is an angel, a God, whatever a goddess

1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:16.240
 with, or an alien, with humans. And that's the place. Okay. So the place is New Mexico. So we,

1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:23.040
 so New Mexico becomes folded into the mythology of this new religion is what I call a new type of

1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:31.760
 religion of the UFO. And it becomes ground zero for this new mythology. Just like Mecca is the,

1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:37.200
 is the place where Muslims go, they have to go right at least once in their lives. It's a pilgrimage

1:56:37.200 --> 1:56:42.640
 place now. So this is, so in my book, that's how I, I tell it. Now, what about Roswell in the

1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:50.000
 public imagination? Obviously, according to Annie Jacobson, who's good, you know, she's a great

1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:55.280
 author, investigative journalist, she's written about Roswell too. I don't agree with all of

1:56:55.280 --> 1:56:59.520
 what she comes up with. But part of it is that there's a lot of military stuff going on there

1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:05.120
 that is classified. And there's a reason why you can't get in. And nor would you want to, right?

1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:13.200
 So, so there's a lot of experimentation going on there. I don't believe that it has to do with

1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:20.240
 ETs, frankly. But in the imaginations of Americans, Roswell is that place. But I went to a different

1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:26.080
 place. And apparently, there are several places in New Mexico. Now, strangely enough, I traveled

1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:32.160
 back to New Mexico at the very end chapter of my book. But it's not, I don't, I don't go there

1:57:32.160 --> 1:57:39.360
 physically. I go there through the story of a Catholic, a nun, who actually believes that she

1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:49.280
 bilocated to New Mexico in the, gosh, in the 1600s. So she, yeah, it was very strange. And I was at the

1:57:49.280 --> 1:57:55.120
 Vatican at the Space Observatory when I made that connection that she probably went to the very,

1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:58.240
 well, she believed she went to this very place that I had gone.

1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:03.120
 Can you, can you elaborate on a little bit? Like, what does it mean to go to that place?

1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:04.640
 For her?

1:58:04.640 --> 1:58:14.160
 Yeah, for her. I mean, we're kind of breaking down the barrier between what it means to be at a

1:58:14.160 --> 1:58:20.960
 place in time. Right. I agree with you. This is the field of religious studies. So, and again,

1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:27.520
 I don't say it's true in my book. I just say it's a very strange coincidence that I'm at the

1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:32.800
 Vatican Observatory. In fact, I'd finished my book. But while I was at the Vatican Observatory,

1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:38.480
 I was there with Tyler. And we were looking at the records, they're called the trial records,

1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:44.000
 but they're the canonization records of these two saints. Each was said to have done amazing

1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:50.240
 things. One was Joseph of Cupertino, who levitated, okay, or is said to have levitated.

1:58:50.240 --> 1:58:56.800
 The other was Maria of Agrida from Spain, their contemporaries in the 1600s, who was said to

1:58:56.800 --> 1:59:01.920
 have been able to bilocate, which is to be in two places at once. Okay. So, this is a belief in

1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:06.720
 Catholicism that certain very holy people can do these kinds of things like levitate,

1:59:06.720 --> 1:59:11.840
 which by the way is also associated with UFO abductions, you know, people get levitated out

1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:18.000
 of their beds and things like that. So, we were sent there by a billionaire who was interested

1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:26.400
 in levitation and bilocation. And since I could get into the Vatican, and I knew the director of

1:59:26.400 --> 1:59:32.240
 the Vatican Observatory, both Tyler and I were able to go to the secret archives and look at the

1:59:32.240 --> 1:59:38.400
 canonization records and then go to Castle Gandolfo, which is about an hour from the Vatican,

1:59:38.400 --> 1:59:45.600
 where the first observatory, the space observatory of the Vatican is. The second one is in Arizona

1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:51.920
 and it has a much larger telescope. So, we went and we, and Brother Guy gave me the keys to the

1:59:51.920 --> 1:59:56.080
 archive. I said, look at anything you want. And I got to see a lot of stuff by Carl Sagan,

1:59:56.080 --> 2:00:01.040
 by the way. And he talked about, yeah, it was awesome. So, they have a whole section on extraterrestrial,

2:00:01.040 --> 2:00:04.240
 the search for extraterrestrial life. And they don't, by the way.

2:00:04.240 --> 2:00:05.200
 How awesome is that?

2:00:05.200 --> 2:00:09.200
 It was awesome. Yeah. So, we got to stay there. They have a scholar's quarters.

2:00:09.200 --> 2:00:15.360
 And so, they had two. And so, Tyler stayed in one and I stayed in the other. And Brother Guy

2:00:15.360 --> 2:00:21.440
 probably shouldn't have been so nice to me and given me the keys because I, when I got home,

2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:25.360
 we were there for two weeks, when I got home, I got this frantic phone call from him. And he

2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:31.360
 basically said, Diana, he goes, do you remember where you put the original Kepler? And so, I had

2:00:31.360 --> 2:00:40.000
 this Kepler, right? And so, I misplaced it. Luckily, I remembered where it went. I was like,

2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:45.760
 oh gosh, thank goodness I found it. But he'll probably change the rules of the Vatican Observatory

2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:54.000
 after my visit. So, Maria is, she's actually in the history of our country in that she first wrote

2:00:54.000 --> 2:01:01.760
 a cosmography of what she said was the spinning earth. And this is in the 1600s. And she, that's

2:01:01.760 --> 2:01:10.240
 her first book. And she wrote that. And then she said that she was transported on the wings of angels

2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:18.080
 to the New World. And she said that she met a culture of people. And she basically told them

2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:25.520
 about the faith of Catholicism. And then what happened was that the people that, and she described

2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:31.120
 the fauna, she described the people and everything like that. And so, there were actually missionaries

2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:38.960
 there. And when they went to try to convert some of the people who already lived there,

2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:43.440
 apparently they already knew a bunch of stuff. And they said, how did you know all this stuff? And

2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:48.800
 they said, this lady in blue came and told us, and they said, did it look like this? And they

2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:56.160
 showed them, they obviously didn't have a photograph, but they had a picture of a sister, a nun. And

2:01:56.160 --> 2:02:03.200
 they said, yeah, she wore similar clothes, but she was much younger, right? And these guys were,

2:02:03.200 --> 2:02:07.600
 you know, thought that was weird. But when they went back to Spain, they found that this woman

2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:12.960
 had been doing that in her mind, had been traveling. I mean, I don't know what to make of it. There's

2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:19.680
 so many things that are sort of forcing you to kind of go outside of, you know, I'm of many minds.

2:02:19.680 --> 2:02:26.160
 I have very, most of my days spent with very rigorous scientific kind of things, and even

2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:33.040
 engineering kind of things. And then I'm also open minded. And just the entirety of the idea

2:02:33.040 --> 2:02:40.320
 of extraterrestrial life forces you to think outside of conventional boundaries of thought,

2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:45.200
 scientific, current scientific thought, let's put it that way. And your story right now is

2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:52.560
 freaking you out. That's okay. That's a nice way to put it. What do you, just another person that

2:02:52.560 --> 2:03:01.280
 seems to be a key figure in this, in the mythology of this is Bob Lazar. It'd be interesting. Maybe

2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:08.000
 there's others you can tell me about, but Bob, who's also been on Joe Rogan, but his story has been

2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:17.760
 told quite a bit. And he's got, I think he said that he witnessed some of the work being done

2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:28.160
 on the spacecraft that was, you know, that was captured. And so on, in order to try to reverse

2:03:28.160 --> 2:03:32.400
 engineer some of the technology in terms of the propulsion and so on. What are your thoughts about

2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:39.040
 his story, how it fits into the mythology of this whole thing and brought to you a ufologist,

2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:45.600
 ufologist community? Okay. So regarding Bob Lazar, with respect to his claims,

2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:55.760
 again, I have no way to adjudicate whether or not he actually, you know, encountered this.

2:03:55.760 --> 2:04:05.840
 I do have friends who are. And the people that I know who know his story, some know him,

2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:14.560
 believe him. And they have said to me that the most important thing that they think he has said,

2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:22.000
 in fact, one of them, I think he made a meme out of it or something like that was basically,

2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:29.120
 he said, maybe the public, you know, I regret making it public, maybe the public isn't ready

2:04:29.120 --> 2:04:35.360
 for this kind of information. And basically, they've, they emphasize that to me. And they

2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:42.960
 emphasized it so much that they wanted me to know, right? So that is somewhat creepy to me.

2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:49.360
 So I think, okay, this poor guy Bob Lazar, so many people, you know, this is what happens to

2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:55.840
 people who have experiences like this, they're questioned, their reputations are put on the

2:04:55.840 --> 2:05:03.360
 line. In some instances, their, their reputations are manipulated on purpose to make them look

2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:12.480
 incredible. To me, as a scientist, it's just inspiring that it kind of gives this kind of,

2:05:13.840 --> 2:05:18.960
 I'm not even thinking of it, is there an actual spacecraft being hidden somewhere and studied

2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:24.400
 and so on. I'm thinking of it like, I don't know, it's a thing that gives you a spark of a dream,

2:05:24.400 --> 2:05:31.600
 you know, to, as a reminder that we don't understand most of how this world works.

2:05:32.400 --> 2:05:38.240
 And then we can build technologies that aren't here today, that will allow us to understand

2:05:38.240 --> 2:05:44.160
 much more. And it's kind of like almost like a feeling that it provides, and it inspires and

2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:49.200
 makes you dream. That's the way I see the Bob Lazar story. I don't necessarily, people ask me,

2:05:49.200 --> 2:05:54.320
 because I'm at MIT, people ask me, like, did Bob Lazar actually go to MIT and so on? I don't know,

2:05:54.320 --> 2:06:00.880
 and I personally don't care. Like, it's, that's not what's interesting to me about that story.

2:06:00.880 --> 2:06:06.320
 To me, the myth is more interesting, not interesting actually, but inspiring.

2:06:06.320 --> 2:06:11.760
 Yes. Because inspiring, you're suggesting that the myth inspires you to create reality.

2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:18.240
 Yes. Yeah. I think that's, that's true. So even if it's like not real, it doesn't matter, does it?

2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:24.320
 I mean, in some sense, just like you said, it does. In some sense, it, it doesn't.

2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:32.640
 So a lot of people know how much I love 2001 Space Odyssey. So I got all these emails asking like,

2:06:34.080 --> 2:06:41.040
 hey bro, do you know what's up with the monoliths in like the middle of the desert or whatever it

2:06:41.040 --> 2:06:47.200
 was? I don't, I haven't been actually paying attention. I apologize. But you kind of mentioned

2:06:47.200 --> 2:06:51.440
 offline that this was kind of cool and interesting. What, what do you make of these monoliths? And in

2:06:51.440 --> 2:06:59.360
 general, are you, are you a fan of 2001 Space Odyssey where a monolith showed up? Do you have

2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:03.440
 any thoughts about either the science fiction, the mythology of it, or the reality of it?

2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:14.080
 Yes. Okay. No, okay. And please say more. Right. So first of all, Kubrick's films are not ever

2:07:14.080 --> 2:07:20.480
 easy for me because they're so weird, right? And I don't actually enjoy watching them.

2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:26.880
 But yeah, it doesn't take away from their incredible brilliance though, and their visionary

2:07:26.880 --> 2:07:36.960
 merit. So 2001 Space Odyssey is incredibly visionary. And of course, all those things that

2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:42.640
 people say, I don't have to restate them. In terms of what I've, it's a subtext to my book,

2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:47.440
 by the way, I didn't mean it to be, but it's almost, it's, it's almost a character in my book,

2:07:47.440 --> 2:07:54.480
 2001 Space Odyssey. And when the monoliths started to appear, again, everything went crazy with my

2:07:54.480 --> 2:08:00.240
 everything, internet, social media, phone, what's up, what's going on, right? Is this disclosure?

2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:04.960
 And I thought, well, you know, I'll tell you one thing is it's, let's look at the timing of it.

2:08:04.960 --> 2:08:10.640
 It's a cool, if it's an art, you know, and then copy art and things like that, it's actually happening

2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:16.000
 at a really interesting time when all of us are forced to go online. When all of us are forced

2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:21.040
 because of COVID, right? We're completely now invaded by the screen, or we're invading the

2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:26.160
 screen. Like we're leaving our infrastructure now is completely changed. So the monolith,

2:08:26.160 --> 2:08:32.160
 basically, if art is supposed to like show us life, it certainly has, if that's an art project,

2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:36.080
 somebody did an awesome job with it. But apparently that monolith was there for a long time, right?

2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:40.800
 I mean, that's the thing, it's been there for a couple of years. So they said, okay, all right.

2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:48.000
 That said, if your audience is interested, I think the best theory about the meaning of the

2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:57.920
 monolith is Robert Ager or Robert Ayer. I think it's Robert Ager. He's got a website where he does

2:08:57.920 --> 2:09:04.000
 analyses of films, and it's called Collative Learning or Collative Learning. And he does the

2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:09.680
 meaning of the monolith. Everyone should go look at that because I fully agree with him. I studied

2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:15.520
 different meanings of the monolith in 2001, a space odyssey. I was fascinated. Okay. So what is this

2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:23.520
 about? His, I accepted as soon as I listened to it and watched it. So basically, he says that the

2:09:23.520 --> 2:09:28.240
 monolith is, okay, can you pick up your phone here? What does that look like?

2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:35.840
 Looks awfully a lot like a monolith. Yeah. Okay. So basically, that's what he was saying,

2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:42.160
 was that Kubrick was basically, the monolith was technology or the screen in particular.

2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:47.360
 And he basically was saying that the cinema screen, we're being completely, and if you think

2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:53.200
 about it, look at all this, we live in a screen culture. We have computer screens, iPhone screens,

2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:59.040
 there's phone screens, we have TV screens, everything is something, and now that COVID has come,

2:09:59.040 --> 2:10:03.680
 we're forced to go into these screens and we're forced to live a different material

2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:10.000
 existence than we have lived before. So in my sense, I think that if it's an art project,

2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:17.280
 it's a really good one for that. So I like that, that meaning of it, it's a screen and the screen

2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:23.280
 could take all kinds of forms. I mean, our perception system, in a sense, is a screen

2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:32.080
 between reality and our mind. The screen of the computer is a screen. The virtual reality

2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:37.920
 worlds that we might be one day living in, there will be an interface. I mean, ultimately,

2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:44.800
 it's about the interface. That's interesting. It's an interface to another world of ideas.

2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:51.840
 It's also material change. It's a change in our material, I mean, when people talk about augmented

2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:59.280
 reality, I say we already live in augmented reality, don't we? Because this isn't our grandparents

2:10:59.280 --> 2:11:07.360
 existence. Yeah, I sometimes, you have to pause and remind yourself how weirdly different this

2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:14.640
 reality is than just even like, I mean, 30 years ago, the internet changed so much and social media

2:11:14.640 --> 2:11:23.520
 has changed so much about actually just the space of our thinking. Wikipedia changed so much about

2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:29.680
 the offloading of our knowledge, the way we interact with knowledge. I mean, it offloaded

2:11:29.680 --> 2:11:37.280
 our long term memory about facts onto a digital format, so in the sense that expanded our mind.

2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:43.360
 It's kind of interesting. I'd be curious to see if he has just one interpretation.

2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:47.680
 I wonder if there's a part of this. I've corresponded with him, yes. So over the years,

2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:53.200
 he and I have corresponded. And I told him, I said, look, I'm going to be using this in my book. So

2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:57.360
 I think you should read what I say. And he, of course, wanted to see it.

2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:05.040
 So what do you think about your book? There you get it. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So he is a non believer

2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:13.520
 in alien intelligence and UFOs. But he, and that's fine. But I still agree with him that the meaning

2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:19.920
 of the monolith was the screen. But that doesn't mean the screen isn't like what David Bowie said,

2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:26.160
 right? So it's not exclusive. So I could still use his theory, but differ from the conclusions.

2:12:26.160 --> 2:12:35.120
 In terms of non believer and believer, there's, when you say believer, you also are kind of implying

2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:43.360
 this, that the idea that aliens have visited or had made direct contact with humans in some form.

2:12:45.360 --> 2:12:53.680
 There's also the exploration and the idea of just alien intelligence is out there

2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:57.680
 in the universe. You know, the Drake equation, estimating how many

2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:04.080
 intelligence civilizations may be out there, how many have ever existed, how many are about

2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:11.040
 to communicate with us. I mean, when you just zoom out from our own little selfish perspective of

2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:16.400
 Earth and look at the entirety, let's say the Milky Way galaxy, but maybe even the universe,

2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:20.320
 does the idea that there are intelligence civilizations out there,

2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:26.320
 something that you're excited about, or something that you're terrified about?

2:13:26.960 --> 2:13:33.440
 That's a good question. So basically, I would say I'm not so keen on it.

2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:41.760
 I think that our relationship with technology, as it is, and as it, as I hope it will go,

2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:52.400
 will help us survive. I don't think we're equipped to do it as we stand now, but I think that if we

2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:57.920
 can up our game or let's just put it this way, if technology is an extension of ourselves,

2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:04.240
 which it actually is, it will help us because it'll probably be smarter than us. It'll help

2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:11.600
 us survive in the ways in which it determines best. That said, if there are non human

2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:19.200
 intelligences out there and they have more advanced, obviously, technologies than us,

2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:28.960
 and they actually come, the history of human engagement with other cultures has not gone

2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:36.320
 well for cultures that are less aggressive. So you see what I'm saying? It's not a good idea.

2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:42.240
 Well, I wonder where we stand on the, where humans stand in the full spectrum of aggression.

2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:46.720
 Well, heck, where are we now, Lex? I mean, we're not too great here. We're still

2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:51.840
 aggressing against each other. No, I know, but that will give us a benefit, right? Like,

2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:58.800
 oh, you're saying, I thought, okay, I see, I just have a sense that there may be a lot of

2:14:58.800 --> 2:15:06.080
 maybe a lot of intelligences out there that are less aggressive because they've evolved past it.

2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:11.440
 We can't assume that. No, I know we can't assume that. If we can't assume it,

2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:20.560
 then I'm going to assume the worst. Well, that's despite the fact that I am Russian

2:15:21.280 --> 2:15:26.080
 and think that life is suffering, I tend to assume, not the best, but I tend to assume that

2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:34.320
 there is a best core to creatures, to people and to creatures that ultimately wins out.

2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:41.200
 I think there's an evolutionary advantage to being good to other living creatures.

2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:49.040
 And so ultimately, I think that if there's intelligent civilizations out there that

2:15:49.040 --> 2:15:58.400
 prosper sufficiently to be able to travel across the great spans of space, that they've evolved

2:15:58.400 --> 2:16:08.720
 past silly aggression, that it's more likely in my mind to be deeply cooperative. So like,

2:16:08.720 --> 2:16:15.920
 growth over destruction. Like, growth does not require destruction, I think. But

2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:22.240
 if you see the universe as ultimately a place where it's highly constrained in resources that

2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:30.720
 are necessary for traveling across space and time, then perhaps aggression is necessary in

2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:37.120
 order to aggress against others that are desiring to get access to those resources. I don't know.

2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:44.480
 I tend to try to be optimistic on that front. I think I'm emotionally optimistic and intellectually

2:16:44.480 --> 2:16:54.160
 nonoptimistic. Yeah, I guess I'm there with you. I tend to believe that the happiness

2:16:54.160 --> 2:17:00.640
 and deep fulfillment in life is found in that emotional place. The intellectual place is

2:17:01.440 --> 2:17:09.120
 really useful for building cool new technologies and ideas and so on, but happiness is in the

2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:16.160
 emotional place. And there, it pays off to be optimistic, I think. You said that technology

2:17:16.160 --> 2:17:22.640
 might be able to save us. You know, that's also kind of optimistic, too. It might kill us.

2:17:23.280 --> 2:17:28.080
 There's a talking to you offline a little bit that there was a sense that, you know,

2:17:28.640 --> 2:17:35.760
 that we humans are facing existential risks, that it's not obvious that we will survive for long.

2:17:35.760 --> 2:17:45.200
 Do you have, is there things that you worry about in terms of ways we may destroy ourselves or deeply

2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:54.560
 damage the fabric of human civilization that technology may allow us to avoid or alleviate?

2:17:55.840 --> 2:18:03.920
 Yes, I think that any, you can choose anything, actually, and it could destroy us. Okay, so,

2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:13.840
 you know, pollution, you know, here we're in a pandemic, okay, a meteor, okay. So we can use

2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:20.320
 technology, or the thing is, is that we say we use technology, but actually that's not a correct

2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:30.400
 way of putting it, in my opinion. So there is a term used by others coined by somebody I don't

2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:35.520
 know, and I'm sorry to not give credit where credit's due, but it's called technogenesis.

2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:40.240
 And it's this idea, Heidegger actually had this idea, but he didn't use that term. And it's this

2:18:40.240 --> 2:18:44.880
 idea that we co evolve with technology, that we don't actually use it. Most people think

2:18:44.880 --> 2:18:51.360
 it's like a tool we use, okay, let's use technology to do this. Well, actually, when we engage with

2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:56.960
 technology, we actually engage with it, and it engages back with us, and we engage with it.

2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:06.080
 So it's this co evolution that's happening. And in that sense, I think that as we create

2:19:06.880 --> 2:19:18.400
 more autonomous intelligent AI, it will help us survive. Because, you know, if we co evolve with

2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:24.720
 it, it will need us as much as we need it, is my opinion. How that happens, or if that

2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:32.640
 how if that bears out to be true, we'll see. But I don't think the idea that we use technology

2:19:32.640 --> 2:19:37.520
 is is a correct way to put it. I think that technology is something so strange, the way

2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:42.080
 it is today, like digital technology, I'm not talking about hammers, or things like that,

2:19:42.080 --> 2:19:48.880
 those kinds of tools, okay, is technology is so far removed from that. And our environment is so

2:19:48.880 --> 2:19:53.760
 now conditioned by our technology and the infrastructure we live within the material

2:19:53.760 --> 2:20:00.320
 structure. I think that it's going to, it's not, I don't think it's going to be a Frankenstein.

2:20:00.320 --> 2:20:04.320
 I think it's actually going, you know, like a Mary Shelley type idea of technology, I think it's

2:20:04.320 --> 2:20:11.360
 actually going to be more Promethean in the sense of, you know, think about it, we create

2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:17.280
 children, and then we get old, and we rely upon our children to help us, okay,

2:20:17.280 --> 2:20:22.320
 well, I feel like that about technology, we've created, well, we've created it, right? And so,

2:20:22.320 --> 2:20:36.640
 it's kind of growing up now. Or maybe it's in its teenage years. And we'll see. What do you think

2:20:36.640 --> 2:20:45.520
 about, in terms of this co evolution of the work around brain computer interfaces, and maybe Neural

2:20:45.520 --> 2:20:56.240
 Inc. on seeing Neural Inc. in particular as its long term mission as a symbiosis with artificial

2:20:56.240 --> 2:21:06.320
 intelligence. So like giving a greater bandwidth channel of communication between technology,

2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:15.040
 AI systems, and the biological neural networks of our human mind. What do you think about this

2:21:15.040 --> 2:21:24.000
 idea of connecting directly to the brain in AI systems? I mean, okay, I've listened to your

2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:28.800
 podcast with Alon. I've listened to Alon before, a very intelligent, obviously super smart guy.

2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:35.680
 I think this is already, I mean, not in the specific ways that he is doing it, but I think we

2:21:35.680 --> 2:21:42.320
 are already doing that, okay? And I can give you some examples. And there are really trivial

2:21:42.320 --> 2:21:49.040
 examples, but they do make the point. And this is one of them. So before he started this research

2:21:49.040 --> 2:21:57.120
 on UFOs and UAPs and technology, I actually was looking at the effects of technology and

2:21:58.400 --> 2:22:04.960
 in particular media on religion. And what I did was I was lucky to be asked to be

2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:12.240
 a consultant for various movies. And one in particular I learned a lot from and that was

2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:19.360
 the conjuring. So I was a history consultant for the conjuring. It happens to be my field.

2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:23.520
 It's Catholic studies, right? And you've got these people who are real people and they're,

2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:27.840
 you know, exercising demons and things like that. Okay, so I thought, wow, this is a great

2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:32.640
 example for me. You know, I didn't do it for the money. It doesn't pay well, but I did it to learn,

2:22:32.640 --> 2:22:38.240
 right? So I work closely with the screenwriters who I work with now all the time with. I work

2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:43.200
 with them all the time now. And what I found was this, I found that as the most interesting part

2:22:43.200 --> 2:22:49.760
 of the creation of this movie was the editing process because they would use, it would go

2:22:49.760 --> 2:22:56.400
 through editing and they would use test audiences. And a lot of the test audiences would be like,

2:22:56.400 --> 2:23:00.640
 you know, there's like these things where they test their flicker rates and things like that,

2:23:00.640 --> 2:23:08.480
 the eye flicker rates. And so when it goes really intense, they go to UC Irvine and they do this

2:23:08.480 --> 2:23:16.320
 thing called cognitive consumption, which is basically, or I'm sorry, cognitive consumerism,

2:23:16.320 --> 2:23:22.640
 where they basically hook test audiences up to EKGs and they read their brains and they figure

2:23:22.640 --> 2:23:29.920
 out which scenes create the most arousal. Yeah. And so they cut out all the other scenes. Okay.

2:23:29.920 --> 2:23:34.240
 So what we're getting is we're getting like this drug when we go to the movies or when we do video

2:23:34.240 --> 2:23:40.880
 games or when we watch, we're literally physiologically responding to our technologies.

2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:45.440
 So we're already there. We're already interfacing with them physiologically. So that's my example.

2:23:45.440 --> 2:23:52.560
 Now, the kind of thing that he's doing, Musk is doing with Neuralink, I say, go for it. That's

2:23:52.560 --> 2:23:58.720
 awesome. I hope he does it. You know, I'm fascinated. I want it to happen. Why do I want it to happen?

2:23:58.720 --> 2:24:04.640
 Because I think that, well, first it's inevitable that it's going to happen. I also want to point

2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:10.240
 out that Jacques Valais was trying to get this done back in the 60s and the 70s. He was writing

2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:18.480
 papers about, in fact, the ARPANET, the proto internet, was called Augmentation of the Human

2:24:18.480 --> 2:24:25.520
 Intellect. So we've been doing this for a while. Okay. So props to Elon Musk, but we've been thinking

2:24:25.520 --> 2:24:32.720
 about this for a good time. We've even been visioning it. Okay. So there was a really interesting

2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:40.000
 Jesuit priest. He was French, Tellier Deschardins. I don't know if you know who he is. If not,

2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:47.040
 he's fascinating. He was actually a soldier before he became a priest. And so he believed,

2:24:47.040 --> 2:24:52.400
 he also saw what he called a biosphere. Now, this guy is talking in like the early 20th century,

2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:59.760
 like the 1917, you know, that time period. And so basically he said and wrote about this thing

2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:04.240
 called the new sphere. And he basically said, there will be a point when we merge with our

2:25:04.240 --> 2:25:09.440
 technology, and it's going to be somewhat like some kind of a biosphere. We have this atmosphere,

2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:14.160
 and then we have the stratosphere, and it's going to be this biosphere, and we're all going to be

2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:19.760
 hooked into it mentally. So we'll be able to communicate in a way in which we don't communicate

2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:26.240
 now. So, you know, that sounds so similar to the singularity. So after I've read him many,

2:25:26.240 --> 2:25:33.680
 many years ago, but when I read the Kurzweil's book about the singularity, to me, it read just

2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:41.120
 like religious language, like it read like, you know, because he, in fact, it's so much like

2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:46.800
 revelation to me when I read it, that I even assign it to my students in my classes. I'm like,

2:25:46.800 --> 2:25:51.360
 this is, this is it. You know, this is like a really great book of the singularity, you know,

2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:57.280
 the coming singularity. And this religious event, because it seems like it, when he writes about

2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:03.280
 it, he says, I felt it before I even understood it, you know? He, I mean, Kurzweil. Kurzweil,

2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:09.440
 yeah, Kurzweil. I mean, what are your feelings about, not feelings, thoughts, the feelings too,

2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:15.280
 about the idea of the singularity? Do you think it's ultimately the thing that echoes throughout

2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:25.680
 the history of ideas? Is this like moment of revelation, like this, this almost mythological

2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:36.080
 religious moment? Or is there something more physical to this idea of concrete about the idea of,

2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:40.640
 there'll come a point where our technology, there'll be like a phase shift between

2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:48.480
 the, the basic fabric of like humanity, of how we interact, you know, how evolution brought us

2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:54.960
 to be this biological interaction, that our technology crosses some kind of line of capability

2:26:55.520 --> 2:27:01.760
 that the world be more technology than human to where it'll leave us behind.

2:27:03.040 --> 2:27:06.960
 Sort of. Oh yeah, I don't think it's going to leave us behind. I think it's going to take us along.

2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:11.680
 But it will be, I mean, I guess the idea of the singularity, first of all,

2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:15.440
 isn't the idea of the singularity is like, we can't possibly predict what's on the other side

2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:20.480
 of the singularity. These are the senses, like this is like the world will be fundamentally

2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:26.400
 transformed. Yes, okay, so right. And then it was, you know, this was characterized in various

2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:32.480
 movies like Lucy and stuff like that. You know, Lucy being the first human that, right, we,

2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:38.160
 so kind of replicating and this is going to be the next iteration of humans is the singularity.

2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:45.200
 I actually don't believe that, frankly. However, and the reason I don't believe it is because

2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:51.360
 we're material beings and technology has to have a host. So we're not going to, you know,

2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:56.800
 become something super abstract. Like there's, it's just an impossible to do. There's nothing

2:27:56.800 --> 2:28:01.520
 like that. Well, people will be listening to this podcast a hundred years from now and laughing at

2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:09.680
 it because they'll be all existing in a virtual reality will be all information as opposed to

2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:17.280
 material meaning connected to some kind of concept of physical, physical reality.

2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:20.800
 I don't even know the right words to use. You see, that's because there are none,

2:28:20.800 --> 2:28:27.360
 because there's no place from, there's no view from nowhere. There's no non material.

2:28:27.360 --> 2:28:33.200
 Like we have thoughts, but they're connected to us, right? They're in our, you know,

2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:40.240
 they're somehow, okay. As far as, as far as you know. Listen, platonic forms, I think, is about as,

2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:47.040
 as, you know, close to what we're talking about as possible. Like this place where these things

2:28:47.040 --> 2:28:51.200
 exist and then there's like a physical instantiation of it. No, but see, we're,

2:28:51.200 --> 2:28:59.120
 we're, the question is from the perspective of the platonic form, what does our physical world

2:28:59.120 --> 2:29:04.320
 look like? You know what I'm saying? Like, you know, if, if say you're a creature existing in a

2:29:04.320 --> 2:29:13.440
 virtual reality, like if you grew up your whole life in a virtual reality game, like what is it

2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:19.200
 in somebody in that virtual reality world tells you that there actually exists this physical world

2:29:19.200 --> 2:29:26.400
 world. And in fact, your own, you think you're in this virtual world, but it's actually you're in

2:29:26.400 --> 2:29:32.480
 a body and this is just your mind putting yourself in there's a piece of technology. Like, will they,

2:29:32.480 --> 2:29:37.680
 how will they be able to think of that physical world? Would they, would they sound exactly like

2:29:37.680 --> 2:29:43.280
 you just sounded a minute ago saying like, well, that's silly. Who cares if there's a physical

2:29:43.280 --> 2:29:52.960
 world? It's the, the entirety of the perception and my memories and all of that is in this other

2:29:52.960 --> 2:30:00.400
 realm of, of like information. It's just all just information. Why do I need some kind of weird

2:30:00.960 --> 2:30:07.120
 meat bag to contain? So there's a great, again, I always, you know, return to something for your

2:30:07.120 --> 2:30:14.480
 audience to read or you. There's a great, very short article online for free by David Chalmers.

2:30:14.480 --> 2:30:18.160
 Do you know him? He's the philosopher of consciousness. Yeah, interviewed him on this

2:30:18.160 --> 2:30:25.120
 podcast. Yeah, yeah, he's cool. I used to, I was friends with his best friend for a while

2:30:25.760 --> 2:30:32.720
 when I was in grad school. He probably has some weird friends. He does. He's a philosopher,

2:30:32.720 --> 2:30:39.680
 okay. So I like his fashion choice and his style too. Hang out with him a little bit. It's a great

2:30:39.680 --> 2:30:46.960
 guy. Okay. So he wrote this article, which I use a lot. I love it because it's accessible to

2:30:46.960 --> 2:30:53.520
 undergraduates and it's called Matrix as Metaphysics. And basically it's, it's an answer to

2:30:53.520 --> 2:30:58.720
 external world skepticism, which is basically how do we know there's an external world, right?

2:30:58.720 --> 2:31:06.080
 How do we know that we're not in a matrix right now? And so basically, he's using, he's, he's also,

2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:12.560
 he even references, he uses a religious reference even, he says, you could think of the matrix of

2:31:12.560 --> 2:31:22.240
 the movie as a new, as the new book of Genesis for our new world, right? And I thought, yeah,

2:31:22.240 --> 2:31:29.920
 that's absolutely correct because, you know, we don't know and we don't, we won't know for sure

2:31:29.920 --> 2:31:37.280
 or for certain. Therefore, what we know is what is real to us. And so he goes through these scenarios

2:31:37.280 --> 2:31:41.760
 and within philosophy it's called, there's a, this is different from that, but it's like this

2:31:41.760 --> 2:31:47.840
 brain in a vat, right? If you're a brain in a vat and some not so kind scientist is like

2:31:47.840 --> 2:31:53.520
 recreating this world for you just to see, you know, and you think you're this awesome rock star,

2:31:53.520 --> 2:31:57.920
 right? And you're living this awesome existence, but you're actually just this brain in this vat,

2:31:57.920 --> 2:32:05.920
 okay? But there's still a brain in a vat, okay? So his idea in The Matrix as Metaphysics kind of

2:32:05.920 --> 2:32:12.080
 takes out the brain in a vat like this, I don't know if this is possible. So I've read critiques

2:32:12.080 --> 2:32:18.000
 of this that, you know, what you're talking about is a non dualism, like there's like, you know,

2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:27.920
 or it's not necessarily non dualism. I just, I mean, information in and of itself

2:32:29.520 --> 2:32:32.320
 has to have some kind of material component to it.

2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:39.280
 I mean, it's that when taking it outside the realm of human beings, because dualism is kind of

2:32:39.280 --> 2:32:45.920
 talking about humans, in a sense, it's just possible to me that there could be creatures that exist

2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:52.080
 in a very different form, perhaps rely on very different set of materials

2:32:52.880 --> 2:33:00.320
 that may perhaps not even look like materials to us. Yes, I agree. Which is why like information,

2:33:00.320 --> 2:33:10.240
 it could be even in computers, that information that's traveling inside a computer is connected to

2:33:10.240 --> 2:33:18.640
 actual material movement, right? So like there is, it is ultimately connected to material movement,

2:33:18.640 --> 2:33:25.360
 but it's less and less about the material and more and more about the information. So I just mean

2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:32.000
 that it's possible that... You think the singularity is basically like sloughing off our material

2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:37.120
 existence? Well, I don't know. Because I can tell you that this has been the hope of philosophers

2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:43.760
 and theologians forever. Yeah, well, I don't, I think we're living through a singularity. I don't

2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:51.040
 think, I think this world just, just like as you've said already, has been already transformed

2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:55.760
 significantly and keeps continually being transformed. And we're just riding this big,

2:33:55.760 --> 2:34:03.520
 beautiful wave of transformation. And that's why it's both exciting and terrifying

2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:11.360
 from a scientific perspective that like we're so bad at predicting the future. And the future is

2:34:11.360 --> 2:34:18.080
 always so amazing in terms of the things that has brought us. I mean, I don't know if it's always

2:34:18.080 --> 2:34:24.080
 will be this exciting in terms of the rate of innovation, but it seems to be increasing still.

2:34:24.080 --> 2:34:29.600
 And it's really exciting. It's exciting. It's terrifying because obviously we're building

2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:35.600
 better and better tools for destroying ourselves. But I, on the optimistic side, believe that we're

2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:41.680
 also can build better and better tools to defend against all the ways we can destroy ourselves.

2:34:41.680 --> 2:34:49.280
 And it's kind of this interesting race of innovation. Books are great. Of course, the greatest

2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:54.400
 book of all time, two of the greatest books of all time are yours. But besides those,

2:34:56.720 --> 2:35:05.440
 what, what books, technical fiction or philosophical had an impact on your life

2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:10.560
 or possibly you think others might want to read and get some insights from.

2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:17.520
 And what ideas did you pick up from them? Great. Okay. I really enjoy Nietzsche. Okay. So anything

2:35:17.520 --> 2:35:23.360
 by Nietzsche, Frederick Nietzsche, he's a philosopher. I actually hated him when I first read him

2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:28.800
 in my early twenties. That's like the opposite of most people's experience, right? They usually

2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:35.120
 love them in their twenties and then they throw them to the curb later. Yeah. Yeah. I think he's

2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:41.520
 totally misrepresented and misinterpreted. He grew on you. Well, it happened in one night. So

2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:48.240
 let me just describe it because it's kind of funny. It happened on New Year's. So I had friends and

2:35:48.240 --> 2:35:51.920
 when I was in my twenties and they were kept, they kept telling me, you have to read Nietzsche. You

2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:58.400
 have to read Nietzsche. And I tried. Okay. But again, you know, no, I didn't like, was not into

2:35:59.200 --> 2:36:04.960
 how he described the philosophical concepts he was trying to get across. So, but they would

2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:13.040
 like, they weren't giving up by very persistent friends. So one of them gave me the gay science

2:36:13.040 --> 2:36:20.480
 and I had it on my book stand and it was New Year's Eve and I'm actually not a big part. I'm

2:36:20.480 --> 2:36:26.560
 actually an introvert. I'm a geeky introvert. Okay. So I don't go out and party a lot. It was

2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:30.880
 New Year's Eve. Even that couldn't get me out to go party. So I just wanted to go to bed. Yeah.

2:36:30.880 --> 2:36:36.320
 And New Year's Eve hit and everybody went out and I was asleep and they woke me up. And I was

2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:41.040
 like, darn, they woke me up. I might as well read this book by Nietzsche. Okay. So I picked it up

2:36:41.040 --> 2:36:46.000
 and lo and behold, I turned to a page that was exactly about, it was called Sanctus

2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:50.960
 Januarius, which is basically St. January. And it was about New Year's Eve. And I thought,

2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:55.840
 whoa, what a weird coincidence. And it was a really, it was also super Catholic. And it was

2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:02.240
 a really beautiful little aphorism. It's actually a book of aphorisms, which are kind of religious,

2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:08.080
 right? And so it's religious, the genre is religious. Let's put it that way, but he's not.

2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:14.000
 So basically he says, today is the day when people are supposed to make these resolutions,

2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:21.680
 right? And he says, from here on out, I will never say no. I will only say yes. Okay. I look away.

2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:25.680
 If something's horrible, I'll just look away from it. I won't get angry at it. And then he also

2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:33.040
 says, I will be like St. January. And St. January is actually the saint whose blood is in this place

2:37:33.040 --> 2:37:40.160
 in Italy. I think it's in Italy. And every year, it turns to blood again. So it's like,

2:37:40.160 --> 2:37:47.840
 it's desiccated. So it's this miracle. He says, my blood is now, it flows again. And I was like,

2:37:47.840 --> 2:37:52.240
 wow, that's really beautiful. And I said, and a strange coincidence, because it just turned

2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:59.040
 12. So it's like New Year's Eve, I pick up the book, I read this aphorism, and I said, strange

2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:04.880
 coincidence, that, and then I turn the page. And the page is about coincidences. And I was like,

2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:09.760
 I shut it. And I thought, this is weird. And I felt like they was alive. I felt like the book

2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:15.200
 was alive and Nietzsche was speaking to me, right? I had a like experience and engagement with Nietzsche.

2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:21.440
 And so after that, I couldn't put his stuff down. It was engaging, fascinating, everything. So yeah,

2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:26.880
 so that's one book, The Gay Science. What did you pick up from The Gay Science or from Nietzsche

2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:32.160
 and Jenner? Is there some ideas that... Yeah, yeah, the idea is basically that truth,

2:38:33.520 --> 2:38:42.400
 he's got awesome one liners. So truth is a woman. So okay, what does he mean by that?

2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:47.120
 Truth is a woman. Basically, she's going to lie to you. She looks real attractive,

2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:55.600
 but she's not going to tell you the truth. Okay, so basically, I'm not saying that,

2:38:55.600 --> 2:39:01.200
 that's true about women. I'm obviously a woman. So basically, what he's saying is that truth

2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:07.200
 is not is like what I said, Brother Guy said, it's a moving target. Okay, we started this

2:39:07.200 --> 2:39:11.600
 whole conversation with what's real, right? So I should have just gone straight to Nietzsche.

2:39:11.600 --> 2:39:18.400
 Haven't you heard truth is a woman? Okay, so truth is a woman. All right, so that and also,

2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:23.760
 and you know, Foucault, this other philosopher, French philosopher actually takes up this idea

2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:29.760
 and creates his own framework called genealogy from it. So the genealogy of morals,

2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:36.560
 so that we only believe certain things and we sediment them into truth. So we say, you know,

2:39:36.560 --> 2:39:43.680
 a truth told, who said that? Was it Lenin or Stalin? A truth told enough times, I mean,

2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:48.160
 a lie told enough times becomes the truth. So that's basically Nietzschean right there.

2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:52.480
 Okay, so that's Nietzsche. So Nietzsche also is a huge critic of Christianity,

2:39:53.680 --> 2:39:59.440
 which I'm actually Catholic, I'm a practicing Catholic. So I appreciated his critique. I

2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:04.560
 thought it was actually quite accurate. And he's a critique of religion in general,

2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:11.200
 and he's fascinating. And also, I find that his, he talks about altered states of consciousness,

2:40:11.200 --> 2:40:16.800
 and he calls them elevated states. And he, I think through his book, you can actually experience

2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:26.400
 elevated states. So yeah, Nietzsche, thumbs up. So what other book? Yeah, okay, so Hannah Rent,

2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:31.600
 she is a philosopher that not a lot of people know about. But she was a Jewish woman during the

2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:40.240
 Holocaust, and she was interned at Bergen Belsen, which was basically Auschwitz for women, and she

2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:45.520
 escaped. She came to the United States, and she had worked with Heidegger, even though he's supposed

2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:52.000
 to be anti Semitic and a Nazi and everything, but they were lovers. Okay, so she comes out and she's

2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:57.360
 at Columbia University, and she teaches philosophy there. And she writes this, she writes two books

2:40:57.360 --> 2:41:03.200
 which I'll recommend. One is called Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she attends the Nuremberg trials,

2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:09.040
 and she basically makes this really astute observation about evil. And she says, Eichmann is

2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:12.960
 one of the people who sent the Jews to the concentration camps who ran the trains, okay.

2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:20.160
 And she said, the thing about Eichmann was that he didn't seem particularly evil. Actually,

2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:25.680
 he seemed to be quite a nice guy. She said, what was interesting about him was he seemed

2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:31.280
 incredibly thoughtless and stupid. And she said, and he used a lot of stereotypes like memes.

2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:36.240
 So she actually wrote about memes before we had them. And now people just use memes, and they're

2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:42.000
 actually used against us even. There's even a segment of warfare called memetic warfare. All

2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:48.000
 right. So memes are something that can sway a whole population of people. So she wrote about

2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:52.800
 memes before they were even in existence. And that's Eichmann in Jerusalem. And I think she also

2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:59.440
 has some really amazing things to say about evil, is that when people remain thoughtless,

2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:04.560
 she has another book called The Life of the Mind, which is gigantic, and I don't think anybody will

2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:09.680
 read it. But frankly, it's one of the best books I've ever read. And I've read it many times.

2:42:09.680 --> 2:42:13.520
 And basically, the life of the mind, and the life of the mind, she asks a very simple question.

2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:19.520
 She says, why do people do bad things? Why are they evil? And what she says is she wonders if it's,

2:42:19.520 --> 2:42:24.400
 she says that bad people sleep well at night, contrary to, you know how they're saying,

2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:27.920
 how do you sleep at night? Well, that's only because you're a good person that you're asking

2:42:27.920 --> 2:42:32.480
 that question, because you actually have a conscience. And a conscience is this dual kind

2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:38.160
 of you fight with yourself about the consequences of your actions. And she says, bad people don't

2:42:38.160 --> 2:42:42.400
 seem to have a conscience. So they actually sleep well at night. And so she goes through a whole

2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:48.320
 history of philosophy about evil. And that's really a good one too. But I also have to recommend

2:42:48.320 --> 2:42:52.320
 this one too. There's one more. So I know I recommended two, but just from the same philosopher.

2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:57.760
 My friend Jeffrey Kreipel, he's at Rice University and he's in my field of Religious Studies.

2:42:57.760 --> 2:43:01.680
 He wrote, he's written several books. I mean, he's written a heck of a lot of books, let's put it

2:43:01.680 --> 2:43:06.880
 that way. But he's his, I think his best book, or the one that impacted me the most, is called

2:43:06.880 --> 2:43:12.400
 Authors of the Impossible. And his book is his writing is very much like Nietzsche's writing,

2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:18.640
 in the sense that he, it's almost as if he reaches out of the pages and he grabs you and he kind of

2:43:18.640 --> 2:43:24.400
 slaps you around and says, think about this, you know, and you can't help but be changed after

2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:29.200
 you've read it. And he's got a great chapter in there about Jacques Velay. Oh, so he colors a

2:43:29.200 --> 2:43:37.280
 bunch of different thinkers and authors that are out that somehow are, what is it, renegade in

2:43:37.280 --> 2:43:42.400
 some aspect or revolution in some aspect? Yeah, they're thinking the impossible. There's a great

2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:49.520
 one. He's written called Mutants and Mystics, where he talks about the comic strips. Gosh,

2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:54.720
 why can't I remember the name of the person? He just died of Stan Lee. He talks about the history

2:43:54.720 --> 2:44:00.400
 of the comics by Stan Lee, and they're all paranormal. They all start off super paranormal

2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:09.520
 and it's fascinating. On the topic of Hannah Arendt. Yeah, Hannah Arendt. So I haven't

2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:17.920
 read her work, but I've vaguely touched upon sort of like commentary of her work. And it seems like

2:44:17.920 --> 2:44:22.560
 some people think her work is dangerous in some aspect. I don't know if you can comment on

2:44:22.560 --> 2:44:31.120
 why that is. It feels like similar with Arendt or something like that, where like this is,

2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:36.960
 I should say not dangerous, but controversial. Yes, they think it's controversial. This is

2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:41.840
 the reason, I believe, I've heard of the controversy. The controversy is that she didn't,

2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:50.720
 first of all, she is Jewish and she did escape a concentration camp. And yet she's called,

2:44:50.720 --> 2:44:57.760
 she's been called anti Jewish. And I think part of that was that she basically was saying something

2:44:59.200 --> 2:45:08.000
 that I believe that a lot of normal people are like Eichmann and evil things are done by people

2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:13.520
 who just follow the rules and they don't think about what they're doing. And that's one of the

2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:22.160
 most pernicious forms of evil of our time. So we talked quite a bit about the definitions of religion

2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:28.080
 and what are the different building blocks of religion. So one of the, I don't think we touched

2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:33.760
 on, we did a little bit with afterlife, but in the sense, I don't know if you're familiar with

2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:39.680
 Ernest Becker work and all the philosophies around there about the fear of death and

2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:46.640
 how the fear of our own mortality, awareness of our own mortality and its fear is,

2:45:48.800 --> 2:45:58.400
 in case of Ernest Becker, is a significant component in the psychology in the way we humans

2:45:58.400 --> 2:46:07.120
 develop our understanding of the world. So what are your thoughts in the context of religion or

2:46:07.120 --> 2:46:14.320
 maybe in the context of your own mind about the role of death in life or fear of death in life?

2:46:15.360 --> 2:46:23.760
 And are you afraid of death, Diana? We cover everything in this podcast. Every single topic

2:46:23.760 --> 2:46:34.560
 is covered. Wow. Okay. I so happen to have benefited, perhaps, from living with an older

2:46:34.560 --> 2:46:43.680
 brother who seemingly had no fear of death while growing up. And he did everything. Okay. So he was,

2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:50.320
 he climbed mountains, he was a rock climber, he jumped out of airplanes. Of course, he had to be a

2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:58.320
 green beret and go into the special forces where that type of thing is a requirement, right? And so

2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:03.600
 because of that, I did a lot of things outside of my comfort zone, and which probably I shouldn't

2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:12.880
 have done. And hope to goodness, my kids don't do them. Okay. Okay. So do I fear death? I think

2:47:12.880 --> 2:47:19.520
 about death a lot, actually. You may not know this about me, but in my field, I was the head,

2:47:19.520 --> 2:47:26.640
 I was the cochair of the death panel. It's called the death panel. It's the panel to

2:47:27.520 --> 2:47:31.920
 think about death in religious studies. And I was that for many years.

2:47:31.920 --> 2:47:34.000
 So you've thought about it a bit.

2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:39.680
 A bit. Let's see. I think that people are a little too confident, I think, about life in

2:47:39.680 --> 2:47:44.960
 general, that they're going to kind of live all the time and not die. I happen to, I mean,

2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:51.040
 I hate to say it, I'm super positive and most people would consider me to be too happy almost,

2:47:51.040 --> 2:47:56.400
 right? And so it's odd then that I spend a lot of time thinking about death, but I wonder if

2:47:56.400 --> 2:48:02.640
 there's a connection there. I'm happy to be alive, right? That's kind of what the thinking about death

2:48:02.640 --> 2:48:08.240
 does is it makes you appreciate the days that you do have. It's a weird controversy. I tend

2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:18.000
 to believe that the fact that this life ends gives each day a significant amount of meaning.

2:48:19.280 --> 2:48:24.800
 So I don't know. It seems like an important feature of life. It's not like a bug. It seems

2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:30.720
 like a feature that it ends, but it's a strange feature because I wish it, I call the good stuff

2:48:30.720 --> 2:48:35.280
 you wish it wouldn't end. Well, you know what's interesting, Lex, and I do point this out to

2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:41.120
 my students because we cover a lot of the basic studies courses I teach. We cover all religions

2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:47.040
 or as many as we can, like the major religions. And so take Hinduism, for example. Now, this

2:48:47.040 --> 2:48:51.920
 is an ancient religion. So you and I are here talking about how we enjoy living and life and

2:48:51.920 --> 2:48:56.960
 things like that. Well, the goal of Hinduism is basically never to get reincarnated again,

2:48:56.960 --> 2:49:02.080
 is basically to not live and to get off Samsara, which is the wheel of life and death.

2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:07.920
 Escape the whole thing. Yeah, exactly. Think of that. Conditions are so different

2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:12.640
 that you and I and my students are happy to be alive. But they're back in the day,

2:49:13.680 --> 2:49:18.720
 thousands of years ago, when they actually didn't write it, they spoke the Vedas, which were the

2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:24.880
 sacred traditions of India. They wanted off. They didn't want to come back. Life was terrible.

2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:30.720
 That's what people don't have the adequate understanding of history, that for the majority

2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:37.680
 of people, life is really hard, right? And you and I and your audience among the lucky.

2:49:39.280 --> 2:49:42.880
 Yeah. That we actually like life. We want to live.

2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:49.600
 Most of the time. Yeah, most of the time. What do you think the biggest since we're covering

2:49:49.600 --> 2:49:55.040
 every single possible topic? Let me ask the biggest one, the unanswerable one, from the

2:49:55.040 --> 2:50:00.080
 perspective of alien intelligence, or from the perspective of religious studies, or from the

2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:07.600
 perspective of just Diana, what do you think is the meaning of this existence of this life of ours?

2:50:07.600 --> 2:50:16.720
 Yes. Okay. So, all right. So, well, of course, I have to, my philosophical training as

2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:24.320
 undergrad always makes me think about like, what's the assumption in your question? There's

2:50:24.320 --> 2:50:27.040
 an assumption there. It's like, there is a meaning. Okay, that's the assumption.

2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:30.400
 What do you mean by meaning? What do you mean by life? Do you define the terms?

2:50:30.400 --> 2:50:34.400
 No, no. But listen, I'll answer your question. I'm just going to say that there's this assumption

2:50:34.400 --> 2:50:39.120
 that we should have meaning to life. Okay. Well, maybe we shouldn't. Maybe it's just all random.

2:50:39.120 --> 2:50:44.560
 Okay. However, I believe that it's not. And in my opinion, on the meaning of life,

2:50:44.560 --> 2:50:50.480
 in my opinion, is intrinsic. I enjoy living. I want to live. Sometimes I don't enjoy living.

2:50:50.480 --> 2:50:55.280
 And when I don't enjoy living, I change my circumstances. So, it's intrinsic. And I think

2:50:55.280 --> 2:50:59.680
 that certain things are intrinsic. And like love, love of your children is kind of,

2:50:59.680 --> 2:51:04.160
 well, it's actually physiological, but it's also intrinsic. It's beautiful.

2:51:04.960 --> 2:51:13.760
 There's something about it that is intrinsically desirable. So, I think the meaning of life is

2:51:13.760 --> 2:51:20.320
 like that, intrinsically desirable. So, it's something that just is born inside you

2:51:21.600 --> 2:51:27.600
 based on what makes you feel good? No, that's hedonism. That's...

2:51:27.600 --> 2:51:31.680
 That's about what a wordy place love, love, love of your children.

2:51:32.320 --> 2:51:39.120
 Yeah. So, basically, love of your children, by the way, is not always easy because they do things

2:51:39.120 --> 2:51:42.720
 that they shouldn't do. You have to discipline them. That's one of the worst things about

2:51:42.720 --> 2:51:48.400
 parenthood to me is disciplining my children. I don't like to do that. I love them. So,

2:51:48.400 --> 2:51:57.120
 a lot of things that I do that I feel are good are not easy. So, there's an intrinsic sense that,

2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:05.440
 okay, let's take animals. So, we have dogs and cats. So, you might not, but I do. I told you

2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:12.400
 about them. Can you share their names? If I share their names, I will share their names.

2:52:12.400 --> 2:52:19.120
 Okay. So, we have a cat and it has red fluffy hair. And so, we called it Trump. Well, when we got

2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:24.560
 our dog, we figured that it needed a companion. So, we called it Putin. So, we have Trump and

2:52:24.560 --> 2:52:34.240
 Putin. That's the greatest pet names of all time. I'm sorry. And maybe we'll be able to share a

2:52:34.240 --> 2:52:42.720
 picture of your cat because this is awesome. It is really cute. Yeah. Very photogenic. I mean,

2:52:42.720 --> 2:52:49.840
 is this something that's, whether we're talking about love or the intrinsic meaning,

2:52:49.840 --> 2:52:56.480
 do you think that's something that's really special to humans? Or if there is intelligent

2:52:57.280 --> 2:53:02.480
 alien civilizations out there, do you think that's something that they possess as well?

2:53:02.480 --> 2:53:12.160
 Well, maybe in different forms. Like, whatever this thing that meaning is, this intrinsic drive

2:53:12.160 --> 2:53:18.160
 that we have, do you think that's just a property of life, of some level of complexity,

2:53:19.440 --> 2:53:24.400
 that we will see that everywhere in this universe? In my opinion, and this is just my opinion,

2:53:25.120 --> 2:53:31.120
 I do think that it is, but I also think that it can take different forms. So, if there is like,

2:53:31.120 --> 2:53:37.680
 a think of gravity, gravity kind of makes stuff stick to it. It can track stuff. Well,

2:53:37.680 --> 2:53:44.160
 what is love to you? That does that too. So, people who are, we call them charismatic. Charism,

2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:51.360
 it means love. Charism means light and love. So, a charismatic person is a person who attracts

2:53:51.360 --> 2:54:00.560
 people to them like the sun does. So, I think that whatever this property is that's intrinsic

2:54:00.560 --> 2:54:06.960
 is like gravity and most likely takes different forms in different types of life forms.

2:54:06.960 --> 2:54:13.760
 Yeah, I can't wait until like Albert Einstein type of figure in the future will discover that love is

2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:21.360
 in fact one of the fundamental forces of physics. That would be cool. Diana, this is one of the
