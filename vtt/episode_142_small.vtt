 The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis, his fourth time on the podcast.

00:04.880 --> 00:09.680
 He's a professor at MIT and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group.

00:10.400 --> 00:18.240
 Since this is episode number 142, and 42, as we all know, is the answer to the ultimate question

00:18.240 --> 00:22.960
 of life, the universe, and everything, according to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

00:23.520 --> 00:29.120
 we decided to talk about this unanswerable question of the meaning of life in whatever way

00:29.120 --> 00:36.560
 we two descendants of apes could muster, from biology to psychology to metaphysics and to music.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.000
 Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode,

01:05.520 --> 01:10.480
 As a side note, let me say that the opening 40 minutes of the conversation are all about

01:10.480 --> 01:16.480
 the many songs that formed the soundtrack to the journey of Manolis's life. It was a happy

01:16.480 --> 01:22.560
 accident for me to discover yet another dimension of depth to the fascinating mind of Manolis.

01:22.560 --> 01:28.080
 I include links to YouTube versions of many of the songs we mentioned in the description

01:28.080 --> 01:33.120
 and overlay lyrics on occasion. But if you're just listening to this without listening to the songs

01:33.120 --> 01:38.640
 or watching the video, I hope you still might enjoy as I did the passion that Manolis has for

01:38.640 --> 01:46.080
 music, his singing of the little excerpts from the songs, and in general, the meaning we discuss

01:46.080 --> 01:52.960
 that we pull from the different songs. If music is not your thing, I do give timestamps to the

01:52.960 --> 01:58.400
 less musical and more philosophical parts of the conversation. I hope you enjoy this little

01:58.400 --> 02:05.120
 experimenting conversation about music and life. If you do, please subscribe on YouTube,

02:18.160 --> 02:24.640
 You mentioned Leonard Cohen and the song Hallelujah as a beautiful song. So what are the

02:24.640 --> 02:32.160
 three songs you draw the most meaning from about life? Don't get me started. So there's really

02:32.160 --> 02:38.960
 countless songs that have marked me, that have sort of shaped me in periods of joy and in periods of

02:38.960 --> 02:45.360
 sadness. My son likes to joke that I have a song for every sentence he will say, because very often

02:45.360 --> 02:51.280
 I will break into a song with a sentence he'll say. My wife calls me the radio because I can sort

02:51.280 --> 02:56.160
 of recite hundreds of songs that have really shaped me. So it's going to be very hard to just

02:56.160 --> 03:01.520
 pick a few. So I'm just going to tell you a little bit about my song transition as I've grown up.

03:01.520 --> 03:07.120
 In Greece, it was very much about, as I told you before, the misery, the poverty, but also

03:07.120 --> 03:13.760
 overcoming adversity. So some of the songs that have really shaped me are Hadis Alexiu, for example,

03:13.760 --> 03:19.440
 is one of my favorite singers in Greece. And then there's also really just old traditional songs

03:19.440 --> 03:26.400
 that my parents used to listen to. Like one of them is Nemon Plousios, which is basically,

03:26.400 --> 03:33.440
 oh, if I was rich. And the song is painting this beautiful picture about all the noises that you

03:33.440 --> 03:39.200
 hear in the neighborhood, in his poor neighborhood, the train going by, the priest walking to the

03:39.200 --> 03:44.880
 church and the kids crying next door and all of that. And he says, with all of that, I'm having

03:44.880 --> 03:52.240
 trouble falling asleep and dreaming. If I was rich. And then he was like, you know, breaking to that.

03:52.240 --> 03:58.720
 So it's just a position between the spirit and the sublime and then the physical and the harsh

03:58.720 --> 04:05.040
 reality. It's just not having troubles, not being miserable. So basically, rich to him just means

04:05.040 --> 04:11.520
 out of my misery, basically. And then also being able to travel, being able to sort of be the captain

04:11.520 --> 04:16.000
 of a ship and, you know, see the world and stuff like that. So it's just such beautiful imagery.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.200
 So many of the Greek songs, just like the poetry we talked about, they acknowledge the cruelty,

04:21.200 --> 04:25.680
 the difficulty of life, but are longing for a better life. That's exactly right. And another one

04:25.680 --> 04:32.400
 is phtohologia. And this is one of those songs that has like a fast and joyful half and a slow

04:32.400 --> 04:37.680
 and sad half. And it goes back and forth between them. And it's like phtohologia,

04:41.120 --> 04:47.760
 so poor, you know, basically. It's the state of being poor. I don't even know if there's a word for

04:47.760 --> 04:59.440
 that in English. And then fast part is. So then it's like, oh, you know, basically,

05:00.160 --> 05:05.440
 like the state of being poor and misery, you know, for you, I write all my songs, et cetera.

05:05.440 --> 05:14.560
 And then the fast part is in your arms grew up and suffered and, you know, stood up and, you know,

05:14.560 --> 05:22.720
 rose, men with clear vision, this whole concept of taking on the world with nothing to lose,

05:22.720 --> 05:32.080
 because you've seen the worst of it. This imagery of. So it's describing the young men

05:32.080 --> 05:37.200
 as cypress trees. And that's probably one of my earliest exposure to a metaphor to sort of,

05:37.200 --> 05:42.640
 you know, this very rich imagery. And I love about the fact that I was reading a story to

05:42.640 --> 05:47.600
 my kids the other day and it was dark. And my daughter who's six is like, oh, can I please

05:47.600 --> 05:54.240
 see the pictures? And Jonathan, who's eight. So my daughter, Cleo, is like, oh, let's look at the

05:54.240 --> 05:59.120
 pictures and my son Jonathan. He's like, but, but Cleo, if you look at the pictures, it's just an

05:59.120 --> 06:06.640
 image. If you just close your eyes and listen, it's a video. That's brilliant. It's beautiful.

06:06.640 --> 06:12.160
 And he's basically showing just how much more the human imagination has, besides just a few images

06:12.160 --> 06:17.040
 that, you know, the book will give you. And then another one, oh, gosh, this one is really like

06:17.040 --> 06:25.200
 miserable. It's, it's called stopper yali to cry for. And it's basically describing how

06:27.440 --> 06:33.680
 vigorously we took on our life and we pushed hard towards the direction that we then realized

06:33.680 --> 06:40.240
 was the wrong one. And it again, these songs give you so much perspective. There's no songs like

06:40.240 --> 06:44.800
 that in English that will basically, you know, sort of just smack you in the face about sort of

06:44.800 --> 06:50.400
 the passion and the force and the drive. And then it turns out, ah, we just followed the wrong life.

06:50.400 --> 06:57.600
 Yeah. And it's like, wow. Okay. So that was, all right. So that, that's like before 12. So, so,

06:57.600 --> 07:05.680
 you know, growing up in sort of this horrendously miserable, you know, sort of view of romanticism

07:05.680 --> 07:12.640
 of, you know, suffering. So then my preteen years is like, you know, learning English through songs.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.960
 So basically, you know, listening to all the American pop songs and then memorizing them

07:16.960 --> 07:23.200
 vocally before I even knew what they meant. So, you know, Madonna and Michael Jackson and all of

07:23.200 --> 07:28.320
 these sort of really popular songs and, you know, George Michael and just songs that I would just

07:28.320 --> 07:32.480
 listen to the radio and repeat vocally. And eventually as I started learning English, I was

07:32.480 --> 07:36.320
 like, oh, wow, this thing has been repeating. I know, I now understand what it means without

07:36.320 --> 07:42.960
 re listening to it. But just with re repeating it was like, oh, again, Michael Jackson's man in the

07:42.960 --> 07:49.680
 mirror is teaching you that it's your responsibility to just improve yourself. You know, if you want

07:49.680 --> 07:53.760
 to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and make the change, this whole concept

07:53.760 --> 07:57.520
 of again, I mean, all of these songs, you can listen to them shallowly, or you can just listen

07:57.520 --> 08:02.320
 to them and say, oh, there's deeper meaning here. And I think there's a certain philosophy

08:02.320 --> 08:08.560
 of song as a way of touching the psyche. So if you look at regions of the brain, people who have

08:08.560 --> 08:12.640
 lost their language ability, because they have an accident in that region of the brain, can actually

08:13.280 --> 08:19.360
 sing because it's exactly the symmetric region of the brain. And that again teaches you so much

08:19.360 --> 08:28.320
 about language evolution and sort of the duality of musicality and, you know, rhythmic patterns and

08:28.320 --> 08:35.280
 eventually language. Do you have a sense of why songs developed? So you're kind of suggesting

08:35.280 --> 08:43.280
 that it's possible that there is something important about our connection with song and with music on

08:43.280 --> 08:49.280
 the level of the importance of language? Is it possible? It's not just possible. In my view,

08:49.280 --> 08:54.640
 language comes after music, language comes after song. No, seriously, like basically my view of

08:54.640 --> 09:02.640
 human cognitive evolution is rituals. If you look at many early cultures, there's rituals around

09:02.640 --> 09:10.400
 every stage of life. There's organized dance performances around mating. And if you look

09:10.400 --> 09:14.960
 at mate selection, I mean, that's an evolutionary drive right there. So basically, if you're not

09:14.960 --> 09:20.880
 able to string together a complex dance as a bird, you don't get a mate. And that actually forms

09:20.880 --> 09:27.920
 this development for many song learning birds. Not every bird knows how to sing. And not every bird

09:27.920 --> 09:34.320
 knows how to learn a complicated song. So basically, there's birds that simply have the same few

09:34.320 --> 09:38.800
 tunes that they know how to play. And a lot of that is inherent and genetically encoded. And

09:38.800 --> 09:45.840
 others are birds that learn how to sing. And the, you know, if you look at a lot of these exotic

09:45.840 --> 09:50.800
 birds of paradise and stuff like that, like the mating rituals they have are enormously amazing.

09:50.800 --> 09:56.080
 And I think human mating rituals of, you know, ancient tribes are not very far off from that.

09:56.080 --> 10:04.240
 And in my view, the sequential formation of these movements is a prelude to the cognitive

10:04.240 --> 10:10.400
 capabilities that ultimately enable language. It's fascinating to think that that's not just

10:10.400 --> 10:16.080
 an accidental precursor to intelligence. It's actually selected. It's well, it's actually

10:16.080 --> 10:21.600
 selected and it's a prerequisite. It's like it's required for intelligence.

10:21.600 --> 10:28.560
 And even as language has now developed, I think the artistic expression is needed,

10:28.560 --> 10:35.040
 like badly needed by our brain. So it's not just that, oh, our brain can kind of, you know,

10:35.040 --> 10:39.600
 take a break and go do that stuff. No, I mean, you know, I don't know if you remember that scene

10:39.600 --> 10:47.200
 from, oh gosh, was that Jack Nicholson movie in New Hampshire? All work and no play, make Jack a

10:47.200 --> 10:55.520
 dull boy. The shining. The shining. So there's this amazing scene where he's constantly trying to

10:55.520 --> 11:00.480
 concentrate and what's coming out of the typewriter is just gibberish. And I have that image as well

11:00.480 --> 11:05.520
 when I'm working and I'm like, no, basically all of these crazy, you know, huge number of hobbies

11:05.520 --> 11:12.640
 that I have, they're not just tolerated by my work. They're required by my work. This ability

11:12.640 --> 11:18.000
 of sort of stretching your brain in all these different directions is connecting your emotional

11:18.000 --> 11:23.760
 self and your cognitive self. And that's a prerequisite to being able to be cognitively

11:23.760 --> 11:27.840
 capable, at least in my view. Yeah, I wonder if the world without art and music,

11:28.640 --> 11:33.520
 you're just making me realize that perhaps that world would be not just devoid of

11:33.520 --> 11:40.320
 fun things to look at or listen to, but devoid of all the other stuff, all the bridges and rockets

11:40.320 --> 11:46.640
 and science. Exactly, exactly. Creativity is not disconnected from art. And, you know, my kids,

11:46.640 --> 11:52.240
 I mean, you know, I could be doing the full math treatment to them. No, they play the piano and

11:52.240 --> 11:59.120
 play the violin and they play sports. I mean, this whole, you know, sort of movement and going

11:59.120 --> 12:05.440
 through mazes and playing tennis and, you know, playing soccer and avoiding obstacles and all of

12:05.440 --> 12:10.480
 that, that forms your three dimensional view of the world. Being able to actually move and run

12:10.480 --> 12:16.160
 and play in three dimensions is extremely important for math, for, you know, stringing together

12:16.160 --> 12:22.720
 complicated concepts. It's the same underlying cognitive machinery that is used for navigating

12:22.720 --> 12:30.960
 mazes and for navigating theorems and sort of solving equations. So I can't, you know, I can't

12:30.960 --> 12:37.040
 have a conversation with my students without, you know, sort of either using my hand or opening the

12:37.040 --> 12:43.680
 whiteboard in Zoom and just constantly drawing or, you know, back when we had in person meetings,

12:43.680 --> 12:49.440
 just the whiteboard. Yeah, that's fascinating to think about. So that's Michael Jackson, man,

12:49.440 --> 12:55.920
 Mayor Carolus Whisper with George Michael, which is a song I like. You didn't say that? I like that

12:55.920 --> 13:01.760
 one. That's too popular for you. I had recorded, no, no, no, it's an amazing song for me. I had

13:01.760 --> 13:07.040
 recorded a small part of it as it played at the tail end of the radio and I had a tape where I

13:07.040 --> 13:13.600
 only had part of that song. And I've just played it over and over and over again. Just so beautiful.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.880
 It's so heartbreaking. That song is almost Greek. It's so heartbreaking.

13:16.880 --> 13:22.080
 You know, George Michael is Greek. Is he Greek? He's Greek. Of course. George Michael is. I mean,

13:22.080 --> 13:30.560
 he's Greek. Yeah. No, you know. I'm so sorry to offend you so deeply not knowing this. So okay,

13:30.560 --> 13:34.880
 so anyway, so we're moving to France when I'm 12 years old and now I'm getting into the songs of

13:34.880 --> 13:42.240
 Gainsbourg. So Gainsbourg is this incredible French composer. He is always seen on stage, like not

13:42.240 --> 13:47.440
 even pretending to try to please just like with your cigarette, just like mumbling his songs.

13:47.440 --> 13:53.760
 But the lyrics are unbelievable. Like basically entire sentences will rhyme. He will say the same

13:53.760 --> 14:01.840
 thing twice and you're like, whoa. And in fact, another speaking of Greek, a French Greek, George

14:01.840 --> 14:15.520
 Moustachy. This song is just magnificent. So with my face of Métèque is actually a Greek word.

14:15.520 --> 14:21.040
 It's, you know, it's a French word for a Greek word. But Mét comes from Metta and then Ek from

14:21.040 --> 14:26.480
 Ikea from Ecology, which means home. So Métèque is someone who has changed homes for a migrant.

14:26.480 --> 14:32.400
 So with my face of a migrant, and you'll love this one, the Juif errant, the Patrick Greek of

14:33.360 --> 14:42.000
 meandering Jew of Greek pastor. So again, you know, the Russian Greek, you know,

14:42.000 --> 14:48.640
 Jew Orthodox connections. And mes cheveux aux quatre vents with my hair in the four wings,

14:48.640 --> 14:55.280
 avec mes yeux tout délavés, qui me donnent lèrent de rêver, avec with my eyes that are all washed

14:55.280 --> 15:02.880
 out, who give me the pretence of dreaming, but who don't dream that much anymore, with my hands of

15:02.880 --> 15:11.760
 thief of musician and who have stolen so many gardens, with my mouth that has drunk, that has

15:12.480 --> 15:22.080
 kissed and that has bitten without ever pleasing its hunger, with my skin that has been rubbed

15:22.080 --> 15:30.960
 in the sun of all the summers and anything that was wearing a skirt. With my heart, and then you

15:30.960 --> 15:37.920
 have to listen to this verse, it's so beautiful, avec mon coeur qui a su faire, souffrir autant

15:37.920 --> 15:48.320
 qu il a souffert, with my heart that knew how to make suffer as much as it suffered, but was able to

15:48.320 --> 15:55.360
 that knew how to make in French is actually su faire, that knew how to make qui a su faire,

15:55.360 --> 16:00.560
 souffrir autant qu il a souffert. Verses that span the whole thing, it's just beautiful.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.880
 Do you know on a small tangent, do you know Jacques Braille?

16:05.600 --> 16:06.800
 Of course, of course.

16:06.800 --> 16:11.920
 Non, non, non, non ma quitte pas, those songs, that song gets me every time.

16:12.480 --> 16:16.960
 So there's a cover of that song by one of my favorite female artists.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.320
 Not Nina Simone.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.120
 No, no, no, no, no.

16:19.680 --> 16:20.000
 Modern?

16:20.000 --> 16:28.400
 Carol Emerald, she's from Amsterdam, and she has a version of non ma quitte pas where she's

16:28.400 --> 16:34.560
 actually added some English lyrics, and it's really beautiful. But again, non ma quitte pas is

16:34.560 --> 16:42.800
 just so, I mean, it's, you know, the promises, the volcanoes that will restart, it's just so beautiful.

16:42.800 --> 16:52.240
 And I love, there's not many songs that show such depth of desperation for another human

16:52.240 --> 16:53.840
 being. That's so powerful.

16:53.840 --> 16:54.640
 I'm sorry, Jeff.

17:00.960 --> 17:04.880
 And then high school, now I'm starting to learn English. So I moved to New York.

17:04.880 --> 17:09.760
 So Sting's Englishman in New York, magnificent song.

17:09.760 --> 17:15.920
 And again, there's, if manners, maggoth manners, someone said, then he's the hero of the day.

17:16.720 --> 17:22.800
 It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile, be yourself, no matter what they say.

17:23.680 --> 17:29.680
 And then takes more than combat gear to make a man, takes more than a license for a gun.

17:30.560 --> 17:36.400
 Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can. A gentleman will walk but never run.

17:36.400 --> 17:41.120
 It's, again, you're talking about songs that teach you how to live. I mean, this is one of them.

17:41.120 --> 17:44.800
 Basically says, it's not the combat gear that makes a man.

17:44.800 --> 17:52.400
 Where's the part where he says, there you go, gentleness so bright, a rare in this society,

17:52.400 --> 17:57.360
 at night a candle's brighter than the sun. So beautiful. He basically says, well,

17:57.360 --> 18:03.680
 you just might be the only one, modesty propriety can lead to not to write, you could end up as the

18:03.680 --> 18:08.720
 you could end up as the only one. It's, um, it basically tells you, you don't have to be like

18:08.720 --> 18:16.880
 the others, be yourself, show kindness, show generosity. Don't, you know, don't let that anger

18:16.880 --> 18:23.760
 get to you. You know the song fragile, how fragile we are, how fragile we are. So again,

18:23.760 --> 18:28.640
 as in Greece, I didn't even know what that meant, how fragile we are, but the song was so beautiful.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.960
 And then eventually I learned English and I actually understand the lyrics. And the song

18:32.960 --> 18:41.120
 is actually written after the contrasts murdered Ben Linder in 1987, and the US eventually turned

18:41.120 --> 18:47.520
 against supporting these guerrillas. And it was just a political song, but so such a realization

18:47.520 --> 18:55.280
 that you can't win with violence, basically. And that song starts with the most beautiful poetry.

18:55.280 --> 19:03.760
 So if blood will flow when flesh and still are one, drying in the color of the evening sun,

19:04.480 --> 19:10.560
 tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away, but something in our minds will always stay.

19:11.600 --> 19:17.760
 Perhaps this final act was meant to clinch a lifetime's argument that nothing comes through

19:17.760 --> 19:26.240
 violence and nothing ever could. For all those born beneath an angry star, lest we forget how

19:26.240 --> 19:36.960
 fragile we are. Damn right. I mean, that's poetry. It was beautiful. And he's using the English

19:36.960 --> 19:44.240
 language is just such a refined way with deep meanings, but also words that rhyme just so

19:44.240 --> 19:53.280
 beautifully. And evocations of when flesh and still are one. I mean, it's just mind boggling.

19:53.280 --> 19:59.120
 And then of course, the refrain that everybody remembers is on and on, the rain will fall,

19:59.120 --> 20:06.720
 etc. But like this beginning star. Yeah. And again, tears from a star, how fragile we are.

20:06.720 --> 20:10.080
 I mean, just these rhymes are just flowing so naturally.

20:10.080 --> 20:15.920
 Something, it seems that more meaning comes when there's a rhythm that I don't know what that is.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.120
 That probably connects to exactly what you were saying. If you pay close attention,

20:19.120 --> 20:25.840
 you will notice that the more obvious words sometimes are the second verse. And the less

20:25.840 --> 20:30.720
 obvious are often the first verse, because it makes the second verse flow much more naturally.

20:31.600 --> 20:35.600
 Because otherwise it feels contrived. Oh, you went and found this like unusual word.

20:35.600 --> 20:42.080
 Yes. In dark moments, the whole album of Pink Floyd and the movie just marked me enormously

20:43.280 --> 20:48.160
 as a teenager, just the wall. And there's one song that never actually made it into the album

20:48.160 --> 20:53.520
 that's only there in the movie about when the tigers broke free and the tigers are the tanks

20:53.520 --> 20:59.760
 of the Germans. And it just describes again, this vivid imagery was just before dawn,

20:59.760 --> 21:05.840
 one miserable morning in black 44, when the forward commander was told to sit tight when

21:05.840 --> 21:12.160
 he asked that his men be withdrawn. And the generals gave thanks as the other ranks held back

21:12.800 --> 21:20.640
 the enemy tanks for a while. And the Anzio bridge, bridge head was held for the price

21:20.640 --> 21:27.280
 of a few hundred ordinary lives. So that's a theme that keeps coming back in Pink Floyd with

21:27.280 --> 21:37.920
 us versus them. Us and them God only knows that's not what we would choose to do for work. He cried

21:38.480 --> 21:45.440
 from the rear and the front rows died from another song. It's like this whole concept of

21:45.440 --> 21:51.280
 us versus them. And there's that theme of us versus them again, where the child is discovering

21:51.280 --> 21:57.440
 how his father died when he finds an old and a found it one day in a draw the whole photographs

21:57.440 --> 22:04.560
 hidden away. And my eyes still grow damp to remember his majesty sign with his own rubber stamp.

22:05.200 --> 22:10.320
 So it's so ironic because it seems the way that he's writing it that he's not crying because

22:10.320 --> 22:16.960
 his father was lost. He's crying because kind old King George took the time to actually write

22:16.960 --> 22:22.480
 mother a note about the fact that his father died. It's so ironic because it basically says

22:23.280 --> 22:27.920
 we are just ordinary men and of course we're disposable. So I don't know if you know what

22:27.920 --> 22:35.840
 the root of the word pioneers, but you had a chessboard here earlier upon in French the pion.

22:36.800 --> 22:41.120
 They are the ones that you send to the front to get murdered slaughter. This whole concept of

22:41.120 --> 22:46.560
 pioneers having taken this whole disposable ordinary men to actually be the ones that,

22:46.560 --> 22:50.960
 you know, we're now treating as heroes. So anyway, there's this juxtaposition of that.

22:50.960 --> 22:56.960
 And then the part that always just strikes me is the music and the tonality totally changes.

22:56.960 --> 23:03.280
 And now he describes the attack. It was dark all around. There was frost in the ground when

23:03.280 --> 23:12.080
 the tigers broke free and no one survived from the royal fusiliers company. They were all left

23:12.080 --> 23:23.360
 behind. Most of them dead. The rest of them dying. And that's how the high command took my daddy from

23:23.360 --> 23:30.560
 me. And that song even though it's not in the album explains the whole movie because it's this

23:30.560 --> 23:36.080
 movie of misery. It's this movie of someone being stuck in their head and not being able to get out

23:36.080 --> 23:43.520
 of it. There's no other movie that I think has captured so well this prison that is someone's

23:43.520 --> 23:50.640
 own mind and this wall that you're stuck inside and this, you know, feeling of loneliness. And

23:50.640 --> 23:58.160
 sort of, is there anybody out there? And, you know, sort of, hello, hello, is there anybody in there?

23:58.160 --> 24:08.320
 It's not if you can hear me. Is there anyone home? Come on. Yeah. I hear your feeling down.

24:08.320 --> 24:19.360
 Just one minute. Anyway, so yeah, the prison of your mind. So those are the darker moments.

24:19.360 --> 24:24.720
 Exactly. These are the darker moments. Yeah, it's in the darker moments, the mind does feel

24:24.720 --> 24:32.240
 like you're trapped alone in a room with it. Yeah. And there's this scene in the movie,

24:32.240 --> 24:36.640
 which is like where he just breaks out with his guitar and there's this prostitute in the room.

24:36.640 --> 24:42.080
 He starts throwing stuff and then he breaks the window. He throws the chair outside and then you

24:42.080 --> 24:47.040
 see him laying in the pool with his own blood, like, you know, everywhere. And then there's

24:47.040 --> 24:52.640
 these endless hours spent fixing every little thing and lining it up. And it's this whole sort of

24:52.640 --> 24:58.400
 mania versus, you know, you can spend hours building up something and just destroy it in a few

24:58.400 --> 25:12.400
 seconds. One of my turns is that song. And it's like, I feel cold as a tourniquet, dry as a funeral

25:12.400 --> 25:23.440
 drum. And then the music bill says, run to the bedroom. There's a suitcase on the left that you find my favorite acts. Don't

25:23.440 --> 25:31.440
 look so frightened. This is just a passing phase. One of my bad days. It's just so beautiful. I need

25:31.440 --> 25:37.440
 to rewatch it. That's so great. But imagine watching this as a teenager. It like ruins your mind.

25:37.440 --> 25:46.640
 It's so many, it's such harsh imagery. And then, you know, anyway, so there's the dark moment.

25:46.640 --> 25:53.120
 And then again, going back to Sting, now it's the political songs, Russians. And I think that song

25:53.120 --> 26:15.360
 should be a new national anthem for the US, not for Russians, but for Red versus Blue.

26:15.360 --> 26:21.440
 What is it doing? It's basically saying the Russians are just as humans as we are.

26:21.440 --> 26:26.880
 There's no way that they're going to let their children die. And then it's just so beautiful.

26:26.880 --> 26:35.920
 How can I save my innocent boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy? And now that's the new national anthem.

26:35.920 --> 26:43.360
 Are you reading? There is a no monopoly of common sense on either side of the political fence.

26:43.360 --> 26:56.560
 We share the same biology, regardless of ideology. Believe me when I say to you I hope the Russians

26:56.560 --> 27:06.720
 love their children too. There's no such thing as a winnable war. It's a lie we don't believe anymore.

27:06.720 --> 27:14.880
 I mean, it's beautiful, right? And for God's sake, America, wake up. These are your fellow

27:14.880 --> 27:22.160
 Americans. They're your fellow biology. There is no monopoly of common sense on either side

27:22.160 --> 27:27.760
 of the political fence. It's just so beautiful. There's no CRISPR simpler way to say Russians

27:27.760 --> 27:33.120
 love their children too, the common humanity. Yeah. And remember what I was telling you,

27:33.120 --> 27:38.960
 I think in one of our first podcasts about the daughter who's crying for her husband,

27:38.960 --> 27:43.040
 for her brother to come back for more. And then the Virgin Mary appears and says,

27:43.040 --> 27:48.480
 who should I take instead? This Turk, here's his family, here's his children. This other one,

27:48.480 --> 27:55.040
 he just got married, et cetera. And that basically says, no, I mean, if you look at the Lord of the

27:55.040 --> 28:01.920
 Rings, the enemies are these monsters. They're not human. And that's what we always do. We always say

28:01.920 --> 28:07.680
 they're not like us. They're different. They're not humans, et cetera. So there's this dehumanization

28:07.680 --> 28:14.240
 that has to happen for people to go to war. If you realize just how close we are genetically,

28:14.240 --> 28:21.120
 one with the other, this whole 99.9% identical, you can't bear weapons against someone who's like

28:21.120 --> 28:27.520
 that. And the things that are the most meaningful to us in our lives at every level is the same

28:27.520 --> 28:32.320
 on all sides, on all sides. Exactly. So not just that we're genetically the same.

28:32.320 --> 28:36.880
 Yeah. We're ideologically the same. We love our children. We love our country. We will,

28:36.880 --> 28:43.840
 you know, we will fight for our family. So, and the last one I mentioned last time we spoke,

28:43.840 --> 28:50.880
 which is Johnny Mitchell's both sides now. So she has three rounds, one on clouds,

28:50.880 --> 28:59.840
 one on love and one on life. And on clouds, she says, rows and flows of angel hair and ice cream

28:59.840 --> 29:08.160
 castles in the air and feather canyons everywhere. I've looked at clouds that way, but now they

29:08.160 --> 29:17.040
 only block the sun. They rain and snow on everyone. So many things I would have done,

29:17.040 --> 29:23.920
 but clouds got in my way. And then I've looked at clouds from both sides now from

29:23.920 --> 29:33.920
 up and down and still somehow it's cloud illusions. I recall, I really don't know clouds

29:34.560 --> 29:41.040
 at all. And then she goes on about love, how it's super, super happy or it's about misery and loss

29:41.040 --> 29:49.040
 and about life. How it's about winning and losing and so forth. But now old friends are acting strange.

29:49.040 --> 29:56.160
 They shake their heads. They say I've changed. Well, some things lost and some things gained

29:56.800 --> 30:02.560
 in living every day. So again, that's growing up and realizing that, well,

30:03.280 --> 30:06.960
 the view that you had as a kid is not necessarily that you have an adult.

30:06.960 --> 30:13.280
 You remember my poem from when I was 16 years old of this whole children dance now all in row.

30:13.280 --> 30:17.600
 And then in the end, even though the snow seems bright without you have lost their light,

30:17.600 --> 30:23.840
 sun that sang and moon that smiled. So this whole concept of if you have love and if you have passion,

30:24.400 --> 30:28.320
 you see the exact same thing from a different way. You can go out running in the rain

30:28.320 --> 30:32.240
 or you could just stay in and say, ah, sucks. I won't be able to go outside now.

30:32.240 --> 30:38.240
 Those signs. Anyway, and the last one is the last last one, I promise, Leonard Cohen.

30:38.240 --> 30:45.600
 This is amazing, by the way. I'm so glad we stumbled on how much joy you have in so many

30:46.720 --> 30:51.360
 avenues of life and music is just one of them. That's amazing. But yes, Leonard Cohen.

30:52.080 --> 30:55.440
 Going back to Leonard Cohen since that's where you started. So Leonard Cohen's dance

30:55.440 --> 30:59.360
 me to the end of love. That's what that was our opening song in our wedding with my wife.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.880
 Oh no, that's good. As we came out to greet the guests, it was dance me to the end of love.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.640
 And then another one, which is just so passionate always. And we always keep

31:06.640 --> 31:12.000
 referring back to it is I'm your man. And it goes on and on about sort of,

31:12.000 --> 31:16.560
 I can be every type of lover for you. And what's really beautiful in marriage

31:16.560 --> 31:23.120
 is that we live that with my wife every day. You can have the passion. You can have the anger.

31:23.120 --> 31:28.320
 You can have the love. You can have the tenderness. There's just so many gems in that song.

31:28.320 --> 31:34.960
 If you want to partner, take my hand. Or if you want to strike me down in anger,

31:35.920 --> 31:43.200
 here I stand. I'm your man. And then if you want a boxer, I will step into the ring for you.

31:43.840 --> 31:48.560
 If you want a driver, climb inside. Or if you want to take me for a ride,

31:49.760 --> 31:54.960
 you know you can. So this whole concept of you want to drive, I'll follow. You want me to drive?

31:54.960 --> 32:00.480
 I'll drive. And the difference, I would say, between like that and Nemekite Paes,

32:00.480 --> 32:07.120
 this song, he's got an attitude. He's like, he's proud of this, his ability to basically be any

32:07.120 --> 32:13.680
 kind of man for the long and long as opposed to the Jacques Braille like desperation of,

32:13.680 --> 32:17.040
 what do I have to be for you to love me? That kind of desperation.

32:17.600 --> 32:23.120
 But notice there's a parallel here. There's a verse that is perhaps not paid attention to

32:23.120 --> 32:31.680
 as much, which says, ah, but a man never got a woman back, not by begging on his knees.

32:32.560 --> 32:38.880
 So it seems that the I'm your man is actually an apology song in the same way that Nemekite Paes

32:38.880 --> 32:45.760
 an apology song. Nemekite Pa basically says, I've screwed up. I'm sorry, baby.

32:45.760 --> 32:50.320
 And in the same way that the careless whisper is all screwed up. Yes, that's right.

32:50.320 --> 32:55.440
 I'm never going to dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm.

32:57.200 --> 33:02.560
 So this is an apology song, not by begging on his knees or I'd crawl to you, baby, and I'd fall at

33:02.560 --> 33:10.000
 your feet and at howl at your beauty like a dog in heat and I'd claw at your heart and I'd tear

33:10.000 --> 33:20.960
 at your sheet and say, please. And then the last one is so beautiful. If you want a father for your

33:20.960 --> 33:31.840
 child or only want to walk with me a while across the sand, I'm your man. That's the last

33:31.840 --> 33:37.840
 verses, which basically says, you want me for a day? I'll be there. You want me to just walk?

33:37.840 --> 33:42.320
 I'll be there. You want me for life? Do you want a father for your child? I'll be there too.

33:42.320 --> 33:46.000
 It's just so beautiful. Oh, sorry. Remember how I told you I was going to finish with a

33:46.000 --> 33:53.280
 lighthearted song? Yes. Last one. You ready? So Allison Krause and Union Station,

33:53.280 --> 34:01.920
 country song, believe it or not, the lucky one. So I've never identified as much with the

34:01.920 --> 34:10.400
 lyrics of a song as this one. And it's hilarious. My friend Seraphim Batoglu is the guy who got me

34:10.400 --> 34:15.280
 to genomics in the first place. I owe enormously to him. And he's another Greek. We actually met

34:15.280 --> 34:19.680
 dancing, believe it or not. So we used to perform Greek dances. I was the president of the International

34:19.680 --> 34:24.880
 Students Association. So we put on these big performances for 500 people at MIT. And there's

34:24.880 --> 34:30.160
 a picture on the MIT Tech where Seraphim, who's like, you know, bodybuilder, was holding on

34:30.160 --> 34:35.040
 his shoulder. And I was like, like doing maneuvers in the air, basically. So anyway, these guys,

34:35.040 --> 34:42.560
 Seraphim, we were driving back from a conference. And there's this Russian girl who was describing

34:42.560 --> 34:46.960
 how every member of her family had been either killed by the communists or killed by the Germans

34:46.960 --> 34:54.400
 or killed by like, she had just like, you know, misery, like death and, you know, sickness and

34:54.400 --> 34:57.280
 everything. Everyone was decimated in her family. She was the last standing member.

34:57.280 --> 35:04.080
 And we stopped at a, Seraphim was driving. And we stopped at a rest area. And he takes me side.

35:04.080 --> 35:11.120
 And he's like, Manolis, we're going to crash. Get her out of my car. And then he basically says,

35:11.120 --> 35:16.000
 but I'm only reassured because you're here with me. And I'm like, what do you mean? He's like,

35:16.560 --> 35:20.400
 you know, he's like, from your smile, I know you're the luckiest man on the planet.

35:20.400 --> 35:27.840
 So there's this really funny thing where I just feel freaking lucky all the time.

35:28.560 --> 35:32.320
 And it's an, it's a question of attitude. Of course, I'm not any luckier than any other person,

35:32.320 --> 35:36.480
 but every science must say something horrible happens to me. I'm like, and in fact, even in

35:36.480 --> 35:40.800
 that song, the, the, the song about sort of, you know, walking on the beach and this, you know,

35:40.800 --> 35:45.840
 sort of taking our life the wrong way. And then, you know, having to turn around at some point,

35:45.840 --> 35:55.280
 he's like, you know, in the fresh sand, we wrote her name. So how nicely that the wind blew.

35:55.840 --> 36:04.560
 And the writing was erased. So again, it's this whole sort of, not just saying, bummer, but,

36:04.560 --> 36:09.840
 oh, great, I just lost this. This must mean something. Right.

36:09.840 --> 36:15.200
 As horrible thing happened, it must open the door to a new door, beautiful chapter.

36:15.200 --> 36:19.760
 So, so Alice on Kraus is talking about the lucky one. So I was like, oh my God, she wrote a song

36:19.760 --> 36:26.320
 for me. And she goes, you're the lucky one. I know that now it's free as the wind,

36:26.320 --> 36:31.840
 blowing down the road, loved by many, hated by none. I'd say you were lucky because you know

36:31.840 --> 36:37.280
 what you've done, not the care in the world, not the worry inside. Everything's going to be all

36:37.280 --> 36:43.360
 right because you're the lucky one. And then she goes, you're the lucky one, always having fun,

36:43.360 --> 36:48.800
 a jack of all trades, a master of none. You look at the world with the smiling eyes and laugh at

36:48.800 --> 36:54.400
 the devil as his train rolls by. I'll give you a song and a one night stand. You'll be looking at

36:54.400 --> 37:00.720
 a happy man because you're the lucky one. It basically says, if you just don't worry too much,

37:01.360 --> 37:09.120
 if you don't try to be, you know, a one, one trick pony, if you just embrace the fact that

37:09.120 --> 37:12.560
 you might suck at a bunch of things, but you're just going to try a lot of things.

37:12.560 --> 37:18.560
 And then there's another verse that says, well, you're blessed, I guess, but never knowing which

37:18.560 --> 37:24.480
 road you're choosing, to you the next best thing, to playing and winning is playing and losing.

37:25.200 --> 37:35.280
 It's just so beautiful because it basically says, if you try your best, but it's still playing,

37:35.280 --> 37:42.720
 if you lose, it's okay. You had an awesome game. And again, superficially, it sounds like a super

37:42.720 --> 37:47.840
 happy song. But then there's the last verse basically says, no matter where you are, that's

37:47.840 --> 37:52.800
 where you'll be, you can bet your luck won't follow me. Just give you a song and then one

37:52.800 --> 37:57.680
 night stand, you'll be looking at a happy man. And in the video of the song, she just walks away

37:57.680 --> 38:03.360
 or he just walks away or something like that. And it basically tells you that freedom comes at a price.

38:03.360 --> 38:07.840
 Freedom comes at the price of non commitment. This whole sort of birds who love or birds who cry,

38:07.840 --> 38:13.760
 you can't really love unless you cry. You can't just be the lucky one, the happy boy, la, la,

38:14.560 --> 38:21.280
 and yet have a long term relationship. So it's, you know, on one hand, I identify with the

38:21.280 --> 38:25.440
 shallowness of the song of, you know, you're the lucky one, jack of all trades, a master of none.

38:26.400 --> 38:32.320
 But at the same time, I identify with a lesson of, well, you can't just be the happy, merry,

38:32.320 --> 38:37.520
 merry, go lucky all the time. Sometimes you have to embrace loss and sometimes you have to embrace

38:37.520 --> 38:43.520
 suffering and sometimes you have to embrace that if you have a safety net, you're not really

38:43.520 --> 38:48.720
 committing enough. You're not, you know, basically you're allowing yourself to slip.

38:49.760 --> 38:54.720
 But if you just go all in and you just, you know, let go of your reservations,

38:54.720 --> 39:00.320
 that's when you truly will get somewhere. So anyway, that's like the, I managed to

39:00.320 --> 39:05.840
 narrow it down to what 15 songs? Thank you for that wonderful journey that you just took us on.

39:07.360 --> 39:16.320
 The darkest possible places of Greek song to ending on this country song. I haven't heard it before,

39:16.320 --> 39:23.200
 but that's exactly right. I feel the same way, depending on the day. Is this the luckiest human

39:23.200 --> 39:30.960
 on earth? And there's something to that, but you're right. It needs to be, we need to now return to

39:30.960 --> 39:38.880
 the muck of life in order to be able to truly enjoy it. What do you mean muck? What's muck?

39:39.760 --> 39:46.000
 The messiness of life, the things that where things don't turn out the way you expect it to.

39:46.000 --> 39:53.120
 The way, so like to feel lucky is like focusing on the beautiful consequences. But then that

39:53.120 --> 39:59.200
 feeling of things being different than you expected, that you stumble in all the kinds

39:59.200 --> 40:03.200
 of ways that seems to be, it needs to be paired with the feeling.

40:03.200 --> 40:07.360
 There's basically one way, the only way not to make mistakes is to never do anything.

40:10.080 --> 40:14.240
 Basically, you have to embrace the fact that you'll be wrong so many times in so many research

40:14.240 --> 40:19.360
 meetings. I just go off on a tangent and I say, let's think about this for a second.

40:19.360 --> 40:24.560
 And it's just crazy for me who's a computer scientist to just tell my biologist friends,

40:24.560 --> 40:29.280
 what if biology kind of worked this way? And they humor me, they just let me talk.

40:30.160 --> 40:37.280
 And rarely has it not gone somewhere good. It's not that I'm always right, but it's always

40:37.280 --> 40:45.680
 something worth exploring further, that if you're an outsider with humility and knowing that I'll

40:45.680 --> 40:52.640
 be wrong a bunch of times, but I'll challenge your assumptions and often take us to a better place

40:53.520 --> 40:59.200
 is part of this whole sort of messiness of life. If you don't try and lose and get hurt

40:59.200 --> 41:05.600
 and suffer and cry and just break your heart and all these feelings of guilt and, wow, I did the

41:05.600 --> 41:13.120
 wrong thing, of course, that's part of life. And that's just something that if you are a doer,

41:13.680 --> 41:19.120
 you'll make mistakes. If you're a criticizer, yeah, sure, you can sit back and criticize

41:19.120 --> 41:23.360
 everybody else for the mistakes they make. Or instead, you can just be out there making those

41:23.360 --> 41:27.200
 mistakes. And frankly, I'd rather be the criticized one than the criticized one.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.720
 Yeah, brilliantly, but...

41:28.720 --> 41:32.400
 Every time somebody steals my bicycle, I say, well, no, my son is like,

41:32.400 --> 41:37.520
 why do they steal our bicycle, Dad? And I'm like, aren't you happy that you have bicycles that people

41:37.520 --> 41:41.520
 can steal? I'd rather be the person stolen from than the stealer.

41:41.520 --> 41:50.000
 Yeah, it's not the critic that counts. So that's, we've just talked amazingly about life from the

41:50.000 --> 41:56.640
 music perspective. Let's talk about life from human life from perhaps other perspective and

41:56.640 --> 42:09.440
 its meaning. So this is episode 142. There is perhaps an absurdly deep meaning to the number

42:09.440 --> 42:16.560
 42 that our culture has elevated. So this is a perfect time to talk about the meaning of life.

42:16.560 --> 42:24.960
 We've talked about it already. But do you think this question that's so simple and so seemingly

42:24.960 --> 42:33.280
 absurd has value of what is the meaning of life? Is it something that raising the question and

42:33.280 --> 42:39.200
 trying to answer it, is that a ridiculous pursuit or is there some value? Is it answerable at all?

42:39.200 --> 42:43.920
 So first of all, I feel that we owe it to your listeners to say why 42.

42:43.920 --> 42:44.160
 Sure.

42:45.920 --> 42:51.600
 So of course, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy came up with 42 as basically a random

42:51.600 --> 42:56.880
 number. Just, you know, the author just pulled it out of a hat and he's admitted so. He said,

42:56.880 --> 43:04.400
 mile 42 just seemed like just random numbers any. But in fact, there's many numbers that are linked

43:04.400 --> 43:14.080
 to 42. So 42, again, just to summarize, is the answer that these super mega computer that had

43:14.080 --> 43:18.720
 computed for a million years with the most powerful computing the world had come up with.

43:18.720 --> 43:25.440
 At some point, the computer says, I have an answer. And they're like, what? It's like,

43:25.440 --> 43:32.000
 you're not going to like it. Like, what is it? It's 42. And then the irony is that they had

43:32.000 --> 43:36.320
 forgotten, of course, what the question was. Yes. So now they have to build bigger computers to

43:36.320 --> 43:42.080
 figure out what the question is, to which the answer is 42. So as I was turning 42, I basically

43:42.080 --> 43:48.240
 sort of researched why 42 is such a cool number. And it turns out that, and I put together this

43:48.240 --> 43:53.280
 little passage that was explaining to all those guests to my 42nd birthday party, why we were

43:53.280 --> 44:01.200
 talking about the meaning of life. And basically talks about how 42 is the angle at which light

44:01.200 --> 44:08.160
 reflects off of water to create a rainbow. And it's so beautiful because the rainbow is basically

44:08.160 --> 44:13.120
 the combination of sort of, it's been raining, but there's hope because the sun just came out.

44:13.120 --> 44:17.600
 So it's a very beautiful number there. So 42 is also the sum of all rows and columns

44:17.600 --> 44:23.600
 of a magic cube that contains all consecutive integers starting at one. So basically, if you

44:23.600 --> 44:30.400
 take all integers between one and however many vertices there are, the sums is always 42. 42

44:30.400 --> 44:37.440
 is the only number left under 100 for which the equation of x to the cube plus y to the cube plus

44:37.440 --> 44:44.000
 z to the cube is n and was not known to not have a solution. And now it's the, you know,

44:44.000 --> 44:50.880
 it's the only one that actually has a solution. 42 is also 101010 in binary. Again, the yin and

44:50.880 --> 44:55.760
 the yang, the good and the evil, one and zero, the balance of the fours. 42 is the number of

44:55.760 --> 45:02.720
 chromosomes for the giant panda. And the giant panda. I know it's totally random. It's a suspicious

45:02.720 --> 45:08.240
 symbol of great strength coupled with peace, friendship, gentle temperament, harmony, balance,

45:08.240 --> 45:13.120
 and friendship, whose black and white colors again symbolize yin and yang. The reason why it's the

45:13.120 --> 45:20.720
 symbol for China is exactly the strength, but yet peace and so on so forth. So 42 chromosomes.

45:21.520 --> 45:28.400
 It takes light 10 to the minus 42 seconds to cross the diameter of a proton connecting the

45:28.400 --> 45:33.760
 two fundamental dimensions of space and time. 42 is the number of times a piece of paper should be

45:33.760 --> 45:43.040
 folded to reach beyond the moon. So, which is what I assume my students mean when they ask

45:43.040 --> 45:45.840
 that their paper reaches for the stars, I just tell them just folded a bunch of times.

45:48.800 --> 45:55.120
 42 is the number of messier object 42, which is Orion. And that's, you know,

45:55.920 --> 46:01.120
 one of the most famous galaxies. It's I think also the place where we can actually see the center

46:01.120 --> 46:09.040
 of our galaxy. 42 is the numeric representation of the star symbol in Ascii, which is very useful

46:09.040 --> 46:14.640
 when searching for the stars and also a reg X for life, the universe and everything. So star.

46:17.040 --> 46:22.160
 In Egyptian mythology, the goddess Maat, which was personifying truth and justice,

46:22.160 --> 46:27.840
 would ask 42 questions to every dying person. And those answering successfully would become stars,

46:27.840 --> 46:33.920
 continued to give life and fuel universal growth. In Judaic tradition, God ascribe is ascribed

46:33.920 --> 46:39.600
 the 42 lettered name and trusted only to the middle age pious meek free from bad temper,

46:39.600 --> 46:46.640
 sober and not insistent on his rights. And in Christian tradition, there's 42 generations from

46:46.640 --> 46:52.640
 Abraham, Isaac, that we talked about the story of Isaac, Jacob, eventually Joseph, Mary and Jesus.

46:52.640 --> 46:59.120
 In Kabbalistic tradition, Eloca, which is 42, is the number with which God creates the universe,

46:59.920 --> 47:09.440
 starting with 25 letter B and ending with 70 good. So 25 plus, you know, 17. There's a 42

47:09.440 --> 47:14.560
 chapter sutra, which is the first Indian religious scripture, which was translated to Chinese,

47:14.560 --> 47:21.840
 thus introducing Buddhism to China from India. The 42 line Bible was the first printed book

47:21.840 --> 47:27.760
 marking the age of printing in the 1450s, and the dissemination of knowledge eventually leading

47:27.760 --> 47:33.600
 to the Enlightenment. A yeast cell, which is a coolest single cell you carry out, and the subject

47:33.600 --> 47:39.600
 of my PhD research has exactly 42 million proteins. Anyway, so there's a series of 40.

47:39.600 --> 47:44.080
 This is, you're on fire with this. These are really good. So I guess what you're saying is just a

47:44.080 --> 47:50.000
 random number. Yeah, basically. So all of these are background names. So, you know, after you have

47:50.000 --> 47:55.600
 the number, you figure out why that number. So anyway, so now that we've spoken about why 42,

47:56.320 --> 48:01.760
 why do we search for meaning? And you're asking, you know, will that search ultimately lead to

48:01.760 --> 48:08.480
 our destruction? And my thinking is exactly the opposite. So basically, that asking about meaning

48:08.480 --> 48:13.360
 is something that's so inherent to human nature. It's something that makes life beautiful,

48:13.360 --> 48:18.800
 that makes it worth living. And that searching for meaning is actually the point. It's not

48:18.800 --> 48:25.200
 the finding it. I think when you found it, you're dead. Don't never be satisfied that,

48:25.200 --> 48:30.880
 you know, I've got it. So I like to say that life is lived forward, but it only makes sense

48:30.880 --> 48:38.720
 backward. And I don't remember whose quote that is, but the whole search itself is the meaning.

48:39.600 --> 48:45.520
 And what I love about it is that there's a double search going on. There's a search

48:45.520 --> 48:52.240
 in every one of us through our own lives to find meaning. And then there's a search which is happening

48:52.240 --> 49:00.960
 for humanity itself to find our meaning. And we as humans like to look at animals and say,

49:00.960 --> 49:05.520
 of course, they have a meaning. Like a dog has its meaning. It's just a bunch of instincts,

49:05.520 --> 49:10.720
 you know, running around, loving everything. You know, remember our joke with a cat and the dog?

49:10.720 --> 49:20.640
 Yeah, cat has no meaning. No, no. So, and I'm noticing the yin yang symbol right here with

49:20.640 --> 49:25.120
 this whole panda black and white and the zero one zero. You're on fire with that 42. Some of

49:25.120 --> 49:33.280
 those are gold, ascii value for star symbol. Damn. Anyway, so, so basically in my view that the

49:33.280 --> 49:42.240
 search for meaning and the act of searching for something more meaningful is life's meaning

49:42.240 --> 49:47.280
 by itself. But the fact that we kind of always hope that yes, maybe for animals that's not the case,

49:47.840 --> 49:52.560
 but maybe humans have something that we should be doing and something else. And it's not just

49:52.560 --> 49:58.160
 about procreation. It's not just about dominance. It's not just about strength and feeding, etc.

49:58.160 --> 50:03.680
 Like we're the one species that spends such a tiny little minority of its time feeding that we

50:03.680 --> 50:09.920
 have this enormous, you know, huge cognitive capability that we can just use for all kinds of

50:09.920 --> 50:16.240
 other stuff. And that's where art comes in. That's where, you know, the healthy mind comes in with,

50:16.240 --> 50:20.880
 you know, exploring all of these different aspects that are just not directly tied to

50:20.880 --> 50:28.480
 to a purpose that's not directly tied to a function. It's really just the playing of life,

50:28.480 --> 50:36.960
 the, you know, not for a particular reason. Do you think this thing we got, this mind is unique

50:36.960 --> 50:44.800
 in the universe in terms of how difficult it is to build? Is it possible that we're the

50:46.080 --> 50:48.960
 most beautiful thing that the universe has constructed?

50:48.960 --> 50:54.080
 Both the most beautiful and the most ugly, but certainly the most complex. So look at evolutionary

50:54.080 --> 51:00.720
 time. The dinosaurs ruled the earth for 135 million years. We've been around for a million years.

51:02.960 --> 51:09.520
 So one versus 135. So dinosaurs were extinct, you know, about 60 million years ago and mammals

51:09.520 --> 51:13.760
 that had been happily evolving as tiny little creatures for 30 million years then took over

51:13.760 --> 51:19.440
 the planet and then, you know, dramatically radiated about 60 million years ago. Out of these

51:19.440 --> 51:26.720
 mammals came the neocortex formation. So basically the neocortex, which is sort of the outer layer

51:26.720 --> 51:31.200
 of our brain compared to our quote unquote reptilian brain, which we share the structure of

51:31.200 --> 51:36.560
 with all of the dinosaurs, they didn't have that and yet they ruled the planet. So how many other

51:36.560 --> 51:44.240
 planets have still, you know, mindless dinosaurs where strength was the only dimension ruling the

51:44.240 --> 51:50.080
 planet? So there was something weird that annihilated the dinosaurs. And again, you could look at

51:50.080 --> 51:54.400
 biblical things of sort of God coming and wiping out his creatures and to make room for the next

51:54.400 --> 52:01.760
 ones. So the mammals basically sort of took over the planet and then grew this cognitive

52:01.760 --> 52:11.280
 capability of this general purpose machine. And primates push that to extreme and humans among

52:11.280 --> 52:21.040
 primates have just exploded that hardware. But that hardware is selected for survival.

52:22.080 --> 52:28.800
 It's selected for procreation. It's initially selected with this very simple Darwinian view

52:28.800 --> 52:35.840
 of the world of random mutation, ruthless election, and then selection for making more of yourself.

52:37.600 --> 52:44.480
 If you look at human cognition, it's gone down a weird evolutionary path in the sense that

52:45.760 --> 52:52.320
 we are expending an enormous amount of energy on this apparatus between our ears that is wasting

52:52.320 --> 53:00.800
 what 15% of our bodily energy, 20% like some enormous percentage of our calories go to function

53:00.800 --> 53:07.760
 our brain. No other species makes that big of a commitment. That has basically taken energetic

53:07.760 --> 53:14.560
 changes for efficiency on the metabolic side for humanity to basically power that thing.

53:15.280 --> 53:20.720
 And our brain is both enormously more efficient than other brains. But also,

53:20.720 --> 53:28.560
 despite this efficiency, enormously more energy consuming. And if you look at just the sheer folds

53:28.560 --> 53:34.240
 that the human brain has, again, our skull could only grow so much before it could no longer go

53:34.240 --> 53:42.080
 through the pelvic opening and kill the mother at every birth. But yet, the folds continued,

53:42.080 --> 53:50.560
 effectively creating just so much more capacity. The evolutionary context in which this was made

53:51.440 --> 53:58.400
 is enormously fascinating. And it has to do with other humans that we have now killed off

53:58.400 --> 54:05.200
 or that have gone extinct. And that has now created this weird place of humans on the planet

54:05.200 --> 54:10.240
 as the only species that has this enormous hardware. So that can basically make us think

54:10.240 --> 54:14.000
 that there's something very weird and unique that happened in human evolution that perhaps has not

54:14.000 --> 54:19.920
 been recreated elsewhere. Maybe the asteroid didn't hit sister earth. And dinosaurs are still

54:19.920 --> 54:25.120
 rolling. And any kind of proto human is squished and eaten for breakfast, basically.

54:28.000 --> 54:33.920
 However, we're not as unique as we like to think because there was this enormous diversity of other

54:33.920 --> 54:40.080
 human like forms. And once you make it to that stage where you have a neocortex like explosion

54:40.080 --> 54:44.640
 of Wow, we're now competing on intelligence. And we're now competing on social structures. And

54:44.640 --> 54:52.800
 we're now competing on larger and larger groups and being able to coordinate and being able to

54:52.800 --> 55:00.560
 have empathy. The concept of empathy, the concept of an ego, the concept of a self of self awareness

55:01.120 --> 55:07.920
 comes probably from being able to project another person's intentions

55:07.920 --> 55:14.080
 to understand what they mean when you have these large cognitive groups, large, large social groups.

55:14.080 --> 55:21.520
 So me being able to sort of create a mental model of how you think may have come before I was able

55:21.520 --> 55:27.920
 to create a personal mental model of how do I think. So this introspection probably came after

55:28.640 --> 55:36.160
 this sort of projection and this empathy, which basically means, you know, passion, pathos, suffering.

55:36.160 --> 55:42.000
 But basically sensing. So basically empathy means feeling what you're feeling, trying to project

55:42.000 --> 55:51.200
 your emotional state onto my cognitive apparatus. And I think that is what eventually led to this

55:51.200 --> 55:59.520
 enormous cognitive explosion that happened in humanity. So, you know, life itself, in my view,

55:59.520 --> 56:07.920
 is inevitable on every planet. Inevitable. Inevitable. But the evolution of life to self

56:07.920 --> 56:13.360
 awareness and cognition and all the incredible things that humans have done, you know, that might

56:13.360 --> 56:19.600
 not be as inevitable. That's your intuition. So if you were to sort of estimate and bet some money

56:19.600 --> 56:29.600
 on it, if we re ran earth a million times, would what we got now be the most special thing? And

56:29.600 --> 56:34.480
 how often would it be? So scientifically speaking, how repeatable is this experiment?

56:36.160 --> 56:38.800
 So this whole cognitive revolution? Yes.

56:40.400 --> 56:48.080
 Maybe not. Maybe not. Basically, I feel that the longevity of, you know, dinosaurs

56:48.080 --> 56:55.920
 suggest that it was not quite inevitable that we humans eventually made it.

56:55.920 --> 57:01.520
 Well, you're also implying one thing here. You're saying you're implying that humans also don't

57:01.520 --> 57:07.360
 have this longevity. This is the interesting question. So with the Fermi paradox, the idea

57:07.920 --> 57:14.800
 that the basic question is like, if the universe has a lot of alien life forms in it, why haven't

57:14.800 --> 57:21.040
 we seen them? Yeah. And one thought is that there is a great filter or multiple great filters

57:21.040 --> 57:26.720
 that basically would destroy intelligent civilizations. This thing that we, you know,

57:26.720 --> 57:32.960
 this multi folding brain that keeps growing may not be such a big feature. It might be useful for

57:32.960 --> 57:40.960
 survival, but it like takes us down a side road that is a very short one with a quick dead end.

57:40.960 --> 57:46.880
 What do you think about that? So I think the universe is enormous, not just in space,

57:46.880 --> 57:56.960
 but also in time. And the pretence that, you know, the last blink of an instant that we've

57:56.960 --> 58:00.800
 been able to send radio waves is when somebody should have been paying attention to our planet

58:01.440 --> 58:09.520
 is a little ridiculous. So my, you know, what I love about Star Wars is a long, long time ago

58:09.520 --> 58:13.360
 in a galaxy far, far away. It's not like some distant future. It's a long, long time ago.

58:13.360 --> 58:20.080
 What I love about it is that basically says, you know, evolution and civilization are just

58:20.080 --> 58:26.000
 so recent in, you know, on earth. Like there's countless other planets that have probably all

58:26.000 --> 58:34.000
 kinds of life forms, multi cellular, perhaps, and so on and so forth. But the fact that humanity

58:34.000 --> 58:41.120
 has only been listening and emitting for just this tiny little blink means that any of these,

58:41.120 --> 58:45.360
 you know, alien civilizations would need to be paying attention to every single insignificant

58:45.360 --> 58:52.240
 planet out there. And, you know, again, I mean, the movie contact and the book is just so beautiful,

58:52.240 --> 58:58.160
 this whole concept of we don't need to travel physically. We can travel as light. We can send

58:58.160 --> 59:03.600
 instructions for people to create machines that will allow us to beam down light and recreate

59:03.600 --> 59:09.200
 ourselves. And in the book, you know, the aliens actually take over. They're not as friendly.

59:09.760 --> 59:14.880
 But, you know, this concept that we have to eventually go and conquer every planet. I mean,

59:14.880 --> 59:21.360
 I think that, yes, we will become a galactic species. So you have a hope. Well, you said

59:21.360 --> 59:26.560
 things. Oh, of course, of course. I mean, now that we've made it so far. So you feel like we've

59:26.560 --> 59:32.160
 made it. Oh gosh, I feel that, you know, cognition, the cognition as an evolutionary trait has won

59:32.160 --> 59:38.160
 over in our planet. There's no doubt that we've made it. So basically, humans have won the battle

59:38.160 --> 59:45.600
 for, you know, dominance. It wasn't necessarily the case with dinosaurs. Like, I mean, yes,

59:45.600 --> 59:52.640
 you know, there's some claims of intelligence. And if you look at Jurassic Park, yes, or whatever.

59:53.760 --> 59:59.440
 But, you know, they just don't have the hardware for it. And humans have the hardware. There's

59:59.440 --> 1:00:05.920
 no doubt that mammals have a dramatically improved hardware for cognition over dinosaurs.

1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:11.520
 Like, basically, there's universes where strength won out. And in our planet, in our, you know,

1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:17.840
 particular version of whatever happened in this planet, cognition won out. And it's kind of cool.

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:22.640
 I mean, it's a privilege, right? But it's kind of like living in Boston instead of, I don't know,

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:30.320
 some middle, middle age place where everybody's like hitting each other with, you know, weapons

1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:36.880
 and sticks. You're back to the lucky one song. I mean, we are the lucky ones. But the flip side

1:00:36.880 --> 1:00:43.520
 of that is that this hardware also allows us to develop weapons and methods of destroying ourselves.

1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:51.440
 And I want to go back to Pinker and the better angels of our nature. The whole concept that

1:00:53.280 --> 1:01:00.400
 civilization and the act of civilizing has dramatically reduced violence.

1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:08.720
 Dramatically. If you look, you know, at every scale, as soon as organization comes,

1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:17.680
 the state basically owns the right to violence. And eventually, the state gives that right of

1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:24.320
 governance to the people. But violence has been eliminated by that state. So this whole concept

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:33.920
 of central governance and people agreeing to live together and share responsibilities and duties

1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:42.800
 and, you know, all of that is something that has led so much to less violence, less death, less

1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:52.160
 suffering, less, you know, poverty, less, you know, war. I mean, yes, we have the capability to

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:58.800
 destroy ourselves. But the arc of civilization has led to much, much less destruction, much,

1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:04.720
 much less war and much more peace. And of course, there's blips back and forth. And, you know,

1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:11.360
 there are setbacks. But again, the moral arc of the universe seems to just...

1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:16.880
 I probably imagine there were two dinosaurs back in the day having this exact conversation.

1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:21.600
 And they look up to the sky and there seems to be something like an asteroid going towards

1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:29.200
 Earth. So while it's very true that the arc of our society of human civilization seems to be

1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:34.480
 progressing towards a better, better life for everybody in the many ways that you described,

1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:42.160
 things can change in a moment. And it feels like it's not just us humans. We're living

1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:48.080
 through a pandemic. You could imagine that a pandemic would be more destructive or

1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:55.280
 or there could be asteroids that just appear out of the darkness of space, which I would

1:02:55.280 --> 1:03:02.720
 recently learned is not that easy to actually detect them. Yes. So 48. What happens in 48 years?

1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:10.320
 I'm not sure. 2068, up office. There's an asteroid that's coming. In 48 years,

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:13.760
 it has a very high chance of actually wiping us out completely. Yes.

1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:20.880
 Yes. We have 48 years to get our act together. It's not like some distant, distant hypothesis.

1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:24.320
 Yes. Like, yeah, sure, they're hard to detect, but this one we know about, it's coming.

1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:29.200
 How do you feel about that? Why are you still talking? Oh, gosh, I'm so happy with where we

1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:33.920
 are now. This is going to be great. Seriously, if you look at progress, if you look at again,

1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:41.840
 the speed with which knowledge has been transferred, what has led to humanity making so many advances

1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:48.960
 so fast? Okay. So what has led to humanity making something advances is not just the hardware

1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:55.360
 upgrades. It's also the software upgrades. So by hardware upgrades, I basically mean our neocortex

1:03:55.360 --> 1:04:01.280
 and the expansion and these layers and folds over brain and all of that. That's the hardware.

1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:08.080
 The hardware hasn't changed much in the last, what, 70,000 years.

1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:14.560
 As I mentioned last time, if you take a person from ancient Egypt and you bring them up now,

1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:22.720
 they're just as equally fit. So hardware hasn't changed. What has changed is software. What has

1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:31.680
 changed is that we are growing up in societies that are much more complex. This whole concept of

1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:39.040
 neotony basically allows our exponential growth. The concept that our brain has not fully formed,

1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:45.280
 has not fully stabilized itself until after our teenage years. So we basically have a good 16

1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:51.600
 years, 18 years to sort of infuse it with the latest and greatest in software. If you look

1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:58.560
 at what happened in ancient Greece, why did everything explode at once? My take on this

1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:05.040
 is that it was the shift from the Egyptian and hieroglyphic software to the Greek language

1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:15.840
 software. This whole concept of creating abstract notions, of creating these layers of cognition

1:05:16.640 --> 1:05:24.640
 and layers of meaning and layers of abstraction for words and ideals and beauty and harmony.

1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:30.480
 How do you write harmony in hieroglyphics? There's no such thing as expressing these ideals of

1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:42.080
 peace and justice or even macabre concepts of doom, etc. You don't have the language for it.

1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:49.920
 Your brain has trouble getting at that concept. So what I'm trying to say is that

1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:59.440
 these software upgrades for human language, human culture, human environment, human education

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:07.200
 have basically led to this enormous explosion of knowledge. And eventually, after the Enlightenment,

1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:13.600
 and as I was mentioning the 42 line Bible and the printed press, the dissemination of knowledge,

1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:19.440
 you basically now have this whole horizontal dispersion of ideas in addition to the vertical

1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:26.000
 inheritance of genes. So the hardware improvements happen through vertical inheritance. The software

1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:31.280
 improvements happen through horizontal inheritance. And the reason why human civilization exploded

1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:36.160
 is not a hardware change anymore. It's really a software change. So if you're looking at now where

1:06:36.160 --> 1:06:43.520
 we are today, look at coronavirus. Yes, sir, it could have killed us a hundred years ago. It would

1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:52.400
 have. But it didn't. Why? Because in January, we published the genome. A month later, less than a

1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:58.080
 month later, the first vaccine designs were done. And now less than a year later, 10 months later,

1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:03.040
 we already have a working vaccine that 90% efficient. I mean, that is ridiculous by any

1:07:03.040 --> 1:07:09.360
 standards. And the reason is sharing. So, you know, the asteroid, yes, could wipe us out in 48 years,

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:17.280
 but 48 years. I mean, look at where we were 48 years ago technologically. I mean, how much more

1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:25.120
 we understand the basic foundations of space is enormous. The technological revolutions of

1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:31.040
 digitization, the amount of compute power we can put on any like, you know,

1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:39.600
 you know, by nail size, you know, hardware is enormous. So, and this is nowhere near ending.

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:45.040
 You know, we all have our like little, you know, problems going back and forth on the social side

1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:50.560
 and on the political side on the cognitive and on the sort of human side and the societal side.

1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:58.240
 But science has not slowed down. Science is moving at a breakneck pace ahead. So, you know,

1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:04.640
 Elon is now putting rockets out from the private space. I mean, that now democratization of space

1:08:04.640 --> 1:08:09.680
 exploration is, you know, gonna revolutionizing. It's gonna explode. It could continue.

1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:15.040
 In the same way that every technology has exploded, this is the shift to space technology

1:08:15.040 --> 1:08:21.920
 exploding. So, 48 years is infinity from now in terms of space capabilities. So, I'm not worried

1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:28.400
 at all. Are you excited by the possibility of a human, well, one, a human stepping foot on Mars

1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:34.400
 and two, possible colonization of not necessarily Mars, but other planets and all that kind of

1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:39.520
 stuff for people living in space. Inevitable. Inevitable. Would you do it? Or do you kind of like

1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:44.000
 Earth? Of course. Of course. You know, how many, how many, how many people will you wait? When

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:50.560
 you wait for, I think it was about when the, the declaration independence was signed about

1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:55.680
 two to three million people lived here. So, would you move like before? Would you be like on the

1:08:55.680 --> 1:09:00.320
 first boat? Would you be on the 10th boat? Would you wait until the declaration of independence?

1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:04.800
 I don't think I'll be on the shortlist because I'll be old by then. They'll probably get a bunch

1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:12.080
 of younger people. But you're, it's the, it's the wisdom and the, then again, you are in the

1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:16.880
 lucky one. I gotta tell you, you are the lucky one. So, you might be on the list. I don't know.

1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:23.760
 I mean, I, I kind of feel like I would love to see Earth from above just to watch our planets.

1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:30.160
 I mean, just, I mean, you know, you can watch a live feed of the space station. Watching Earth

1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:38.080
 is magnificent. Like this blue tiny little shield. It's so thin our atmosphere. Like,

1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:41.920
 if you drive to New York, you're basically in outer space. I mean, it's ridiculous. It's just so

1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:48.080
 thin. And it's just, again, such a privilege to be on this planet. Such a privilege. But I think

1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:58.000
 our species is in for big good things. I think that, you know, we will overcome our little

1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:03.440
 problems and eventually come together as a species. I feel that we, we're definitely on the path to

1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:10.400
 that. And, you know, it's just not permeated through the whole universe yet. I mean, through the whole

1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:14.000
 world yet, through the whole Earth yet. But it's definitely permeating.

1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:23.280
 So you've talked about humans as special. How exactly are we special relative to the dinosaurs?

1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:30.960
 So I mentioned that there's, you know, this dramatic cognitive improvement that we've made.

1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:38.000
 But I think it goes much deeper than that. So if you look at a lion attacking a gazelle

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:45.920
 in the middle of the Serengeti, the lion is smelling the molecules in the environment. It's

1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:55.680
 hormones and neuro receptors are sort of getting it ready for impulse. The target

1:10:55.680 --> 1:11:01.920
 is constantly looking around and sensing. I've actually been in Kenya and I've kind of seen

1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:12.160
 the hunt. So I've kind of seen the sort of game of waiting. And the mitochondria in the muscles

1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:20.160
 of the lion are basically ready for, you know, jumping. They're expensing an enormous amount

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:26.400
 of energy. The grass as it's flowing is constantly transforming solar energy

1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:33.200
 into chloroplasts, you know, through the chloroplasts into energy, which eventually feeds

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:42.800
 the gazelle and eventually feeds the lions and so forth. So as humans, we experience all of that.

1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:51.680
 But the lion only experiences one layer. The mitochondria in its body are only experiencing

1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:58.800
 one layer. The chloroplasts are only experiencing one layer. The, you know, photoreceptors and the

1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:02.640
 smell receptors and the chemical receptors, like the lion always attacks against the wind

1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:11.920
 so that it's not smelled. Like all of these things are one layer at a time. And we humans

1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:17.520
 somehow perceive the whole stack. So going back to software infrastructure and hardware

1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:22.720
 infrastructure, if you design a computer, you basically have a physical layer that you start

1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:27.440
 with. And then on top of that physical layer, you have, you know, the electrical layer. And on

1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:32.800
 top of the electrical layer, you have basically gates and logic and an assembly layer. And on

1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:37.600
 top of the assembly layer, you have your, you know, higher order, higher level programming.

1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:40.960
 And on top of that, you have your deep learning routine, et cetera. And on top of that, you

1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:49.440
 eventually build a cognitive system that's smart. I want you to now picture this cognitive system

1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:56.640
 becoming not just self aware, but also becoming aware of the hardware that it's made of.

1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:03.520
 And the atoms that they're, that it's made of and so on and so forth. So it's as if your AI system,

1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:11.600
 and there's this beautiful scene in 2001, Odyssey of Space, where Hal after Dave starts

1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:19.360
 disconnecting him, he's starting to sing a song about daisies, et cetera. And Hal is basically

1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:28.080
 saying, Dave, I'm losing my mind. I can feel I'm losing my mind. It's just so beautiful.

1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:34.400
 This concept of self awareness of knowing that the hardware is no longer there is amazing.

1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:41.280
 And in the same way, humans who have had accidents are aware that they've had accidents.

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:49.200
 So there's this self awareness of AI that is, you know, this beautiful concept about,

1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:57.200
 you know, sort of the eventual cognitive leap to self awareness. But imagine now the AI system

1:13:57.200 --> 1:14:00.080
 actually breaking through these layers and saying, wait a minute, I think I can design

1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:04.800
 a slightly better hardware to get me functioning better. And that's what basically humans are

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:10.160
 doing. So if you if you look at our reasoning layer, it's built on top of a cognitive layer.

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:16.080
 And the reasoning layer we share with AI, it's kind of cool. Like there is another thing on the

1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:21.280
 planet that can integrate equations. And it's man made. But we share computation with them.

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:27.040
 We share this cognitive layer of playing chess. We're not alone anymore. We're not the only

1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:31.120
 thing on the planet that plays chess. Now we have AI that also plays chess.

1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:36.160
 But in some sense that that particular organism AI as it is now only operates in that layer.

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:42.720
 Exactly. Exactly. And then most animals operate in the sort of cognitive layer that we're all

1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:49.040
 experiencing. A bat is doing this incredible integration of signals. But it's not aware of it.

1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:56.400
 It's basically constantly sending echo location waves, and it's receiving them back.

1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:01.680
 And multiple bats in the same cave are operating at slightly different frequencies,

1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:06.240
 and with slightly different pulses, and they're all sensing objects, and they're doing motion

1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:11.760
 planning in their cognitive hardware. But they're not even aware of all of that. All they know is

1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:17.840
 that they have a 3D view of space around them, just like any gazelle walking through, you know,

1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:25.360
 the desert. And any baby looking around is aware of things without doing the math of

1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:31.120
 how am I processing all of these visual information, etc. We're just aware of the layer that you live in.

1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:39.040
 I think if you look at this, at humanity, we've basically managed through our cognitive layer,

1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:44.320
 through our perception layer, through our senses layer, through our multi organ layer,

1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:51.440
 through our genetic layer, through our molecular layer, through our atomic layer,

1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:57.520
 through our quantum layer, through even the very fabric of the space time continuum,

1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:03.360
 unite all of that cognitively. So as we're watching that scene in the Serengeti,

1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:09.920
 we as scientists, we as educated humans, we as, you know, anyone who's finished high school,

1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:14.640
 are aware of all of this beauty of all of these different layers interplaying together.

1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:19.920
 And I think that's something very unique in perhaps not just the galaxy, but maybe even the cosmos.

1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:28.480
 These species that has managed to, in space, cross through these layers from the enormous

1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:34.080
 to the infinitely small, and that's what I love about particle physics, the fact that it actually

1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:38.480
 unites everything. The very small, the very big. The very small and the very big. It's only through

1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:46.400
 the very big that the very small gets formed. Like basically every atom of gold results from the fusion

1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:51.760
 that happened of, you know, increasingly large particles before that explosion that then

1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:57.280
 versus it through the cosmos. And it's only through understanding the very large that we

1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:04.000
 understand the very small and vice versa. And that's in space. Then there's the time direction.

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:10.880
 As you are watching the Kilimanjaro mountain, you can kind of look back through time

1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:17.040
 to when that volcano was exploding and, you know, growing out of the tectonic forces.

1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:24.240
 As you drive through Death Valley, you see these mountains on their side and these layers

1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:35.040
 of history exposed. We are aware of the eons that have happened on Earth and the tectonic

1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:44.000
 movements on Earth the same way that we're aware of the Big Bang and the early evolution of the

1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:49.200
 cosmos. And we can also see forward in time as to where the universe is heading. We can see,

1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:55.680
 you know, Apophis in 2068 coming over, looking ahead in time. I mean, that would be magician

1:17:55.680 --> 1:18:02.320
 stuff, you know, in ancient times. So what I love about humanity and its role in the universe

1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:07.520
 is that, you know, if there's a god watching, he's like, finally, somebody figured it out.

1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:12.640
 I've been building all these beautiful things and somebody can appreciate and figured me out

1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:18.880
 with God's perspective, meaning like become aware of, you know, yeah. So it's kind of interesting. So

1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:25.280
 to think of the world in this way as layers and us humans are able to what convert those layers

1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:32.000
 into ideas that you can then like combine, right? So we're doing some kind of conversion.

1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:36.880
 Exactly. Exactly. And last time you asked me about whether we live in a simulation, for example.

1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:46.320
 I mean, realize that we are living in a simulation. We are the reality that we're in without any sort

1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:51.760
 of person programming this is a simulation. Like basically, what happens inside your skull?

1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:58.400
 There's this integration of sensory inputs, which are translated into perceptory signals,

1:18:58.400 --> 1:19:04.880
 which are then translated into a conceptual model of the world around you. And that exercise

1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:11.520
 is happening seamlessly. And yet, you know, if you if you think about sort of again,

1:19:11.520 --> 1:19:18.960
 this whole simulation and neo analogy, you can think of the reality that we live in as a matrix,

1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:24.720
 as the matrix. But we've actually broken through the matrix. We've actually traversed the layers.

1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:29.920
 We didn't have to take a pill. Like we didn't make, you know, morphios didn't have to show up

1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:36.400
 to basically give us the blue pill or the red pill. We were able to sufficiently evolve cognitively

1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:41.840
 through the hardware explosion, and sufficiently involve scientifically through the software

1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:47.840
 explosion, to basically get at breaking through the matrix realizing that we live in a matrix,

1:19:47.840 --> 1:19:53.680
 and realizing that we are this thing in there. And yet that thing in there has a consciousness

1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:59.200
 that lives through all these layers. And I think we're the only species, we're the only thing that

1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:06.320
 we even can think of that has actually done that has sort of permeated space and time,

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:15.440
 scales and layers of abstraction, plowing through them, and realizing what we're really,

1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:21.440
 really made of. And the next frontier is, of course, cognition. So we understand so much

1:20:21.440 --> 1:20:27.120
 of the cosmos, so much of the stuff around us, but the stuff inside here, finding the basis for

1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:34.320
 the soul, finding the basis for the ego, for the self, the self awareness. When does the spark

1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:40.960
 happen that basically sort of makes you, you? I mean, that's, you know, really the next frontier.

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:46.320
 So in terms of these peeling off layers of complexity, somewhere between the cognitive

1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:53.680
 layer and the reasoning layer or the computational layer, there's still some stuff to be figured

1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:58.160
 out there. And I think that's the final frontier of sort of completing our journey through that

1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:04.560
 matrix. And maybe duplicating it into in other versions of ourselves through AI,

1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:11.680
 which is another very exciting possibility. What I love about AI and the way that it operates

1:21:11.680 --> 1:21:20.000
 right now is the fact that it is unpredictable. There's emergent behavior in our cognitively

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:30.720
 capable artificial systems that we can certainly model, but we don't encode directly. And that's a

1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:37.600
 key difference. So we like to say, Oh, of course, this is not really intelligent, because we coded

1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:42.800
 it up. And we just put in these little parameters there. And there's like, you know, what's six

1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:46.560
 billion parameters. And once you've learned them, you know, we kind of understand the layers.

1:21:46.560 --> 1:21:54.080
 But that's an oversimplification. It's, it's like saying, Oh, of course, humans, we understand humans,

1:21:54.080 --> 1:22:00.320
 they're just made out of neurons and, you know, layers of cortex, and there's a visual area. And

1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:06.480
 there's a, but, but every human is encoded by a ridiculously small number of genes compared

1:22:06.480 --> 1:22:11.840
 to the complexity of our cognitive apparatus. 20,000 genes is really not that much, out of which

1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:18.240
 a tiny little fraction are in fact, encoding all of our cognitive functions. The rest is emergent

1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:27.520
 behavior. The rest is the, you know, the cortical layers doing their thing in the same way that

1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:32.560
 when we build, you know, these conversational systems or these cognitive systems or these deep

1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:38.720
 learning systems, we put the architecture in place, but then they do their thing. And in some ways,

1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:43.680
 that's creating something that has its own identity. That's creating something that's not just, oh,

1:22:43.680 --> 1:22:49.120
 yeah, it's not the early AI where if you hadn't programmed what happens in the grocery bags when

1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:54.640
 you have both cold and hot and hard and soft, you know, the system wouldn't know what to do. No,

1:22:54.640 --> 1:22:59.920
 no, you basically now just program the primitives. And then it learns from that. So even though the

1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:05.360
 origins are humble, just like it is for our genetic code for AI, even though the origins are humble,

1:23:05.360 --> 1:23:20.320
 the result of it being deployed into the world is infinitely complex. And yet, it's not yet able

1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:31.840
 to be cognizant of all the other layers of its, you know, it's not able to think about space and

1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:37.440
 time. It's not able to think about the hardware in which it runs, the electricity on which it runs

1:23:37.440 --> 1:23:44.080
 yet. So if you look at humans, we basically have the same cognitive architecture as monkeys.

1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:53.360
 That's the great apes. It's just a ton more of it. If you look at GPT3 versus GPT2, again,

1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:59.840
 it's the same architecture, just more of it. And yet it's able to do so much more. So if you start

1:23:59.840 --> 1:24:05.200
 thinking about sort of what's the future of that, GPT4 and GPT5, do you really need fundamentally

1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:11.120
 different architectures or do you just need a ton more hardware? And we do have a ton more hardware.

1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:18.800
 Like these systems are nowhere near what humans have between our ears. So, you know, there's

1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:24.800
 something to be said about stay tuned for emergent behavior. We keep thinking that general

1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:31.280
 intelligence might just be forever away. But it could just simply be that we just need a ton

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:36.720
 more hardware and that humans are just not that different from the great apes, except for just

1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:44.080
 a ton more of it. It's interesting that in the AI community, maybe there's a human centric fear,

1:24:44.080 --> 1:24:51.200
 but the notion that GPT10 will achieve general intelligence is something that people shy away

1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:57.360
 from that there has to be something totally different and new added to this. And yet it's

1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:06.080
 not seriously considered that this very simple thing, this very simple architecture when scaled

1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:11.440
 might be the thing that achieves superintelligence. And people think the same way about humanity

1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:15.840
 and human consciousness, they're like, oh, consciousness might be quantum or it might be,

1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:22.800
 you know, some non physical thing. And it's like, or it could just be a lot more of the same hardware

1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:28.640
 that now is sufficiently capable of self awareness, just because it has the neurons to do it.

1:25:29.200 --> 1:25:37.680
 So maybe the consciousness that is so elusive is an emergent behavior of you basically string

1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:43.680
 together all these cognitive capabilities that come from running from seeing for reacting from

1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:47.760
 predicting the movement of the fly as you're catching it through the air. All of these things

1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:52.480
 are just like great lookup tables encoded in a giant neural network. I mean, I'm over simplifying,

1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:56.480
 of course, the complexity and the diversity of the different types of excitatory and inhibitory

1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:03.680
 neurons, the waveforms that sort of shine through the, you know, the connections across all these

1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:08.720
 different layers, the amalgamation of signals, etc. The brain is enormously complex. I mean,

1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:14.080
 of course, but again, it's a small number of primitives encoded by a tiny number of genes,

1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:23.280
 which are self organized and shaped by their environment. Babies that are growing up today

1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:31.440
 are listening to language from conception. Basically, as soon as the auditory apparatus forms,

1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:36.320
 it's already getting shaped to the types of signals that are out in the real world today.

1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:40.560
 So it's not just like, oh, have an Egyptian be born and then ship them over. It's like, no,

1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:45.760
 that Egyptian would be listening in to the complexity of the world and then getting born

1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:51.920
 and sort of seeing just how much more complex the world is. So it's a combination of the underlying

1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:59.280
 hardware, which if you think about as a geneticist, in my view, the hardware gives you an upper bound

1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:04.880
 of cognitive capabilities, but it's the environment that makes those capabilities shine and reach

1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:13.280
 their maximum. So we're a combination of nature and nurture. The nature is our genes and our cognitive

1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:19.600
 apparatus. And the nurture is the richness of the environment that makes that cognitive apparatus

1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:27.680
 reach its potential. And we are so far from reaching our full potential. So far. I think that kids

1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:33.680
 being born a hundred years from now, they'll be looking at us now and saying what primitive

1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:39.920
 educational systems they had. I can't believe people were not wired into this virtual reality

1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:46.000
 from birth as we are now because they're clearly inferior. And so on and so forth. So basically,

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:52.560
 I think that our environment will continue exploding and our cognitive capabilities,

1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:55.360
 it's not like, oh, we're only using 10% of our brain. That's ridiculous. Of course,

1:27:55.360 --> 1:28:00.880
 we're using 100% of our brain, but it's still constrained by how complex our environment is.

1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:07.600
 So the hardware will remain the same, but the software, in a quickly advancing environment,

1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:14.160
 the software will make a huge difference in the nature of the human experience, the human condition.

1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:18.240
 It's fascinating to think that humans will look very different a hundred years from now,

1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:22.800
 just because the environment changed, even though we're still the same great apes, the descendant

1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:29.600
 of apes. At the core of this is kind of a notion of ideas that I don't know if you're

1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:34.800
 I don't know if you're, there's a lot of people that's including you eloquently about this topic,

1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:43.120
 but Richard Dawkins talks about the notion of memes and say this notion of ideas,

1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:51.520
 you know, multiplying, selecting in the minds of humans. Do you ever think about ideas from

1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:56.720
 that perspective? Ideas as organisms themselves, they're breeding in the minds of humans.

1:28:56.720 --> 1:29:03.360
 I love the concept of memes. I love the concept of these horizontal transfer of ideas and sort

1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:10.800
 of permeating through, you know, our layer of interconnected neural networks. So you can think

1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:18.720
 of sort of the cognitive space that has now connected all of humanity, where we are now one

1:29:18.720 --> 1:29:28.000
 giant information and idea sharing network, well beyond what was thought to be ever capable,

1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:34.400
 when the concept of a meme was created by Richard Dawkins. So, but I want to take that concept,

1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:45.600
 just it, you know, into another twist, which is the horizontal transfer of humans with fellowships.

1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:54.960
 And the fact that as people apply to MIT from around the world, there's a selection that happens,

1:29:55.680 --> 1:30:01.920
 not just for their ideas, but also for the cognitive hardware that came up with those ideas.

1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:08.720
 So we don't just ship ideas around anymore, they don't evolve in a vacuum. The ideas themselves

1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:15.440
 influence the distribution of cognitive systems, i.e. humans and brains around the planet.

1:30:15.440 --> 1:30:18.240
 We ship them to different locations based on their properties.

1:30:18.240 --> 1:30:24.000
 That's exactly right. So those cognitive systems that think of, you know, physics,

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:29.680
 for example, might go to CERN and those that think of genomics might go to the Broad Institute

1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:34.560
 and those that think of computer science might go to, I don't know, Stanford or CMU or MIT.

1:30:35.760 --> 1:30:42.240
 And you basically have this co evolution now of memes and ideas and the cognitive

1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:47.760
 conversational systems that love these ideas and feed on these ideas and understand these

1:30:47.760 --> 1:30:54.640
 ideas and appreciate these ideas now coming together. So you basically have students coming

1:30:54.640 --> 1:30:58.960
 to Boston to study because that's the place where these type of cognitive systems thrive.

1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:07.280
 And they're selected based on their cognitive output and their idea output.

1:31:07.280 --> 1:31:14.320
 But once they get into that place, the boiling and interbreeding of these memes

1:31:14.320 --> 1:31:22.160
 becomes so much more frequent that what comes out of it is so far beyond if ideas were evolving

1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:27.280
 in a vacuum of an already established hardware cognitive interconnection system of the planet

1:31:27.760 --> 1:31:34.240
 where now you basically have the ideas shaping the distribution of these systems

1:31:34.240 --> 1:31:39.600
 and then the genetics kick in as well. You basically have now these people who came to

1:31:39.600 --> 1:31:46.000
 be a student, kind of like myself, who now stuck around and are now professors bringing up our own

1:31:46.720 --> 1:31:54.160
 genetically encoded and genetically related cognitive systems, minor eight, six and three years old,

1:31:55.200 --> 1:32:01.200
 who are now growing up in an environment surrounded by other cognitive systems of a similar age

1:32:01.200 --> 1:32:07.200
 with parents who love these types of thinking and ideas. And you basically have a whole interbreeding

1:32:07.200 --> 1:32:20.160
 now of genetically selected transfer of cognitive systems where the genes and the memes are coevolving

1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:30.000
 the same soup of ever improving knowledge and societal inter fertilization, cross fertilization

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:37.840
 of these ideas. So this beautiful image, so this is shipping these actual meat cognitive

1:32:37.840 --> 1:32:44.400
 systems to physical locations. They tend to cluster in the biology ones, cluster in a certain

1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:50.080
 building too. So like within that, there's clusters on top of clusters on top of clusters.

1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:58.000
 What about in the online world? Do you also see that kind of, because people now form groups on

1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:07.680
 the internet that they stick together, so they can sort of, these cognitive systems can collect

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:15.520
 themselves and breed together in different layers of spaces. It doesn't just have to be physical

1:33:15.520 --> 1:33:19.920
 space. Absolutely. Absolutely. So basically, there's the physical rearrangement, but there's

1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:26.880
 also the conglomeration of the same cognitive system, doesn't need to be a human, doesn't

1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:30.880
 need to belong to only one community. So yes, you might be a member of the computer science

1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:35.360
 department, but you can also hang out in the biology department. But you might also go online

1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:40.800
 into, I don't know, poetry department readings and so forth, or you might be part of a group that only

1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:46.880
 has 12 people in the world, but that are connected through their ideas and are now interbreeding

1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:53.600
 these ideas in a whole other way. So this coevolution of genes and memes is not just

1:33:53.600 --> 1:34:00.800
 physically instantiated, it's also sort of rearranged in this cognitive space as well.

1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:06.800
 And sometimes these cognitive systems hold conferences and they all gather around and

1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:11.200
 there's like, one of them is like talking and they're all like listening and then they discuss

1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:16.160
 and then they have free lunch and so on. No, but then that's where you find students where,

1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:21.280
 when I go to a conference, I go through the posters where I'm on a mission. Basically,

1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:25.760
 my mission is to read and understand what every poster is about. And for a few of them,

1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:29.520
 I'll dive deeply and understand everything, but I make it a point to just go poster after

1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:35.280
 poster in order to read all of them. And I find some gems and students that I speak to

1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:41.760
 that sometimes eventually join my lab. And then sort of you're sort of creating this permeation

1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:52.240
 of the transfer of ideas, of ways of thinking, and very often of moral values, of social structures,

1:34:52.880 --> 1:35:02.000
 of just more imperceptible properties of these cognitive systems that simply just cling together.

1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:09.600
 Basically, I have the luxury at MIT of not just choosing smart people, but choosing

1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:20.080
 smart people who I get along with who are generous and friendly and creative and smart and excited

1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:27.920
 and childish in their uninhibited behaviors and so forth. So you basically can choose

1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:33.920
 yourself to surround, you can choose to surround yourself with people who are not only cognitively

1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:43.360
 compatible, but also, you know, imperceptibly through the meta cognitive systems compatible.

1:35:43.360 --> 1:35:49.600
 And again, when I say compatible, not all the same. Sometimes, you know, not sometimes all

1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:55.040
 the time, the teams are made out of complementary components, not just compatible, but very often

1:35:55.040 --> 1:36:00.800
 complementary. So in my own team, I have a diversity of students who come from very different

1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:05.600
 backgrounds. There's a whole spectrum of biology to computation, of course. But within biology,

1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:10.800
 there's a lot of realms. Within computation, there's a lot of realms. And what makes us

1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:17.840
 click so well together is the fact that not only do we have a common mission, a common passion,

1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:25.440
 and a common, you know, view of the world, but that we're complementary in our skills,

1:36:25.440 --> 1:36:29.520
 in our angles with which we come at it and so forth. And that's sort of what makes it click.

1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:36.400
 Yeah, it's fascinating that the stickiness of multiple cognitive systems together includes

1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:42.000
 both the commonality. So you meet because there's some common thing, but you stick together

1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:46.560
 because you're different in all the useful ways.

1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:53.120
 Yeah. And my wife and I, I mean, we adore each other like two pieces, but we're also extremely

1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:59.440
 different in many ways. And that's beautiful. But I love that about us. I love the

1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:04.160
 fact that, you know, I'm like living out there in the, you know, world of ideas and I forget

1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:10.320
 what day it is. And she's like, well, at 8am, the kids better be to school. And, you know,

1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:18.560
 I do get yelled at. But I need it. Basically, I need her as much as she needs me. And she

1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:22.560
 loves interacting with me and talking. I mean, last night, we were talking about

1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:27.280
 this and I showed her the questions and we were bouncing ideas off each other. And it was just

1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:33.920
 beautiful. Like we basically have these, you know, basically cognitive, you know,

1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:38.800
 let it all loose kind of dates where, you know, we just bring papers and we're like,

1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:44.400
 you know, bouncing ideas and cetera. So, you know, we have extremely different perspectives,

1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:49.760
 but very common, you know, goals and interests and anyway.

1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:54.480
 What do you make of the communication mechanism that we humans use to share those ideas? Because

1:37:54.480 --> 1:38:01.360
 like one essential element of all of this is not just that we're able to have these ideas,

1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:07.120
 but we're also able to share them. We tend to, maybe you can correct me, but we seem to use

1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:12.480
 language to share the ideas. Maybe we share them in some much deeper way than language,

1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:16.960
 I don't know. But what do you make of this whole mechanism and how fundamental it is to

1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:23.120
 the human condition? So, some people will tell you that your language dictates your thoughts

1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:32.320
 and your thoughts cannot form outside language. I tend to disagree. I see thoughts as much more

1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:38.320
 abstract as, you know, basically when I dream, I don't dream in words. I dream in shapes and forms

1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:44.320
 and, you know, three dimensional space with extreme detail. I was describing, so when I wake up in

1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:49.200
 the middle of the night, I actually record my dreams. Sometimes I write them down in a Dropbox

1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:56.880
 file. Other times I'll just dictate them in, you know, audio. And my wife was giving me a massage

1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:03.760
 the other day because like my left side was frozen and I started playing the recording. And as I

1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:08.160
 was listening to it, I was like, I don't remember any of that. And I was like, of course. And then

1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:14.720
 the entire thing came back. But then there's no way any other person could have recreated that entire

1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:21.040
 sort of, you know, three dimensional shape and dream and concept. And in the same way, when I'm

1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:26.320
 thinking of ideas, there's so many ideas I can't put to words. I mean, I will describe them with

1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:32.400
 a thousand words, but the idea itself is much more precise or much more sort of abstract or much more

1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:37.520
 something, you know, difference, either less abstract or more abstract. And it's either, you

1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:45.200
 know, basically, there's just the projection that happens from the three dimensional ideas into,

1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:51.280
 let's say, a one dimensional language. And the language certainly gives you the apparatus to

1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:57.200
 think about concepts that you didn't realize existed before. And with my team, we often create new

1:39:57.200 --> 1:40:01.680
 words. I'm like, well, now we're going to call these the regulatory plexus of a gene. And that

1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:07.120
 gives us now the language to sort of build on that as one concept that you then build upon with all

1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:13.600
 kinds of other other things. So there's this co evolution again of ideas in language, but they're

1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:22.480
 not one to one with each other. Now let's talk about language itself, words, sentences. This is a

1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:29.200
 very distant construct from where language actually begun. So if you look at how we communicate,

1:40:29.200 --> 1:40:36.560
 as I'm speaking, my eyes are shining. And my face is changing through all kinds of emotions. And my

1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:45.040
 entire body composition posture is reshaped. And my intonation, the pauses that I make, the softer

1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:52.400
 and the louder and the this and that are conveying so much more information. And if you look at early

1:40:52.400 --> 1:40:58.400
 human language, and if you look at how, you know, the great Aves communicate with each other,

1:40:58.400 --> 1:41:01.600
 there's a lot of granting, there's a lot of posturing, there's a lot of emotions, there's a

1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:09.920
 lot of sort of shrieking, etc. They have a lot of components of our human language, just not the

1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:22.320
 words. So I think of human communication as combining the ape component, but also of course, the, you

1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:29.040
 know, GPT three components. So basically, there's the cognitive layer and the reasoning layer that

1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:35.040
 we share with different parts of our relatives. There's the AI relatives, but there's also the

1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:40.720
 granting relatives. And what I love about humanity that we have both, we're not just a

1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:50.080
 conversational system, we're a granting, emotionally charged, you know, weirdly interconnected

1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:56.560
 system that also has the ability to reason. And when we communicate with each other,

1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:00.160
 there's so much more than just language, there's so much more than just words.

1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:07.440
 It does seem like we're able to somehow transfer even more than the body language. It seems that

1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:14.800
 in the room with us is always a giant knowledge base of like shared experiences, different

1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:20.320
 perspectives on those experiences. But I don't know, the knowledge of who the last three, four

1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:26.720
 presidents in the United States was and just all the, you know, 911, the tragedies in 911, all the

1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:32.640
 beautiful and terrible things that happen in the world, they're somehow both in our minds,

1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:38.800
 and somehow enrich the ability to transfer information. What I love about it is I can talk

1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:43.600
 to you about 2001 Odyssey of Space and mention a very specific scene and that evokes all these

1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:47.680
 feelings that you had when you first watched it. We're both visualizing that maybe in different

1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:56.160
 ways. Exactly. But in that, yeah. And not only that, but the feeling is brought back up just

1:42:56.160 --> 1:43:02.560
 like you said with the dreams, we both have that feeling arise in some form as you bring up the

1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:09.520
 hell, you know, facing his own mortality. It's fascinating that we're able to do that. I don't

1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:14.880
 know. Now let's talk about Neuralink for a second. So what's the concept of Neuralink? The concept

1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:20.720
 of Neuralink is that I'm going to take whatever knowledge is encoded in my brain directly transferred

1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:27.440
 into your brain. So this is a beautiful, fascinating and extremely sort of, you know,

1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:34.240
 appealing concept. But I see a lot of challenges surrounding that. The first one is we have no

1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:40.400
 idea how to even begin to understand how knowledge is encoded in a person's brain. I mean, I told

1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:46.480
 you about this paper that we had recently with Li Hui Tai and Asaf Marco that basically was looking

1:43:46.480 --> 1:43:52.960
 at these ngrams that are formed with combinations of neurons that cofire when a stimulus happens

1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:57.120
 where we can go into a mouse and select those neurons that fire by marking them and then see

1:43:57.120 --> 1:44:01.520
 what happens when they first fire and then select the neurons that fire again when the experience

1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:07.520
 is repeated. These are the recall neurons. And then there's the memory consolidation neurons.

1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:13.680
 So we're starting to understand a little bit of sort of the distributed nature of knowledge and

1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:20.640
 coding and experience in coding in the human brain and in the mouse brain. And the concept that

1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:28.240
 we'll understand that sufficiently one day to be able to take a snapshot of what does that

1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:34.080
 scene from Dave losing his mind of how losing his mind and talking to Dave.

1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:42.160
 How is that scene encoded in your mind? Imagine the complexity of that. But now imagine,

1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:49.520
 suppose that we solve this problem. And the next enormous challenge is how do I go and modify

1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:55.200
 the next person's brain to now create the same exact neural connections. So that's an enormous

1:44:55.200 --> 1:45:00.880
 challenge right there. So basically, it's not just reading, it's now writing. And again,

1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:05.440
 what if something goes wrong? I don't want to even think about that. That's number two. And number

1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:12.800
 three, who says that the way that you encode Dave, I'm losing my mind. And I encode Dave,

1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:18.960
 I'm losing my mind is anywhere near each other. Basically, maybe the way that I'm encoding it

1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:26.400
 is twisted with my childhood memories of running through, you know, the pebbles in Greece,

1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:33.040
 and yours is twisted with your childhood memory and growing up in Russia. And there's no way

1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:37.360
 that I can take my encoding and put it into your brain, because it'll A, mess things up,

1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:42.800
 and B, be incompatible with your own unique experiences.

1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:46.880
 So that's telepathic communications from human to human. It's fascinating. You're

1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:54.400
 reminding us that there's two biological systems on both ends of that communication. The one,

1:45:54.400 --> 1:46:01.040
 the easier, I guess, maybe half as difficult thing to do in the hope with Neuralink is that

1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:06.640
 we can communicate with an AI system. So where one side of that is a little bit

1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:13.120
 more controllable. But even just that is exceptionally difficult.

1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:19.200
 Let's talk about two neuronal systems talking to each other. Suppose that GPT4 tells GPT3,

1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:24.720
 hey, give me all your knowledge. Right? It's ready. I have 10 times more hardware. I'm ready.

1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:30.160
 Just feed me. What's GPT3 going to do? Is it going to say, Oh, here's my 10 billion parameters?

1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:36.400
 No, no way. The simplest way, and perhaps the fastest way for GPT3 to transfer all its knowledge

1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:44.320
 to its older body that has a lot more hardware is to regenerate every single possible human

1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:49.920
 sentence that it can possibly create. Just keep talking. Keep talking and just reencode it all

1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:56.000
 together. So maybe what language does is exactly that. It's taking one generative cognitive model.

1:46:56.640 --> 1:47:01.680
 It's running it forward to emit utterances that kind of make sense in my cognitive frame.

1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:07.200
 And it's reencoding them into yours through the parsing of that same language.

1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:12.080
 And I think the conversation might actually be the most efficient way to do it. So not just

1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:18.240
 talking, but interactive. So talking back and forth, asking questions, interrupting.

1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:23.440
 So GPT4 will constantly be interrupting. Just annoying it.

1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:29.040
 But the beauty of that is also that as we're interrupting each other,

1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:35.520
 there's all kinds of misinterpretations that happen. That, you know, as basically when my

1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:40.480
 students speak, I will often know that I'm misunderstanding what they're saying. And I'll

1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:45.200
 be like, hold that thought for a second. Let me tell you what I think I understood, which I know

1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:49.760
 is different from what you said. Then I'll say that. And then someone else in the same Zoom

1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:55.440
 meeting will basically say, Well, you know, here's another way to think about what you just said.

1:47:55.440 --> 1:48:00.880
 And then by the third iteration, we're somewhere completely different that if we could actually

1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:07.040
 communicate with full, you know, neural network parameters back and forth of that knowledge

1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:16.320
 and idea and coding would be far inferior because the reencoding with our own, as we said last time,

1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:23.680
 emotional baggage and cognitive baggage from our unique experiences through our shared

1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:31.280
 experiences, distinct encodings in the context of all our unique experiences is leading to so much

1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:41.120
 more diversity of perspectives. And again, going back to this whole concept of these entire network

1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:47.200
 of all of human cognitive systems connected to each other and sort of how ideas and memes permeate

1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:54.880
 through that. That's sort of what really creates a whole new level of human experience through

1:48:54.880 --> 1:49:03.120
 this reasoning layer and this computational layer that obviously lives on top of our cognitive layer.

1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:14.640
 So you're one of these aforementioned cognitive systems, mortal, but thoughtful,

1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:19.920
 and you're connected to a bunch, like you said, students, your wife, your kids.

1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:26.320
 What do you, in your brief time here on earth, this is a meaning of life episode.

1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:34.000
 So what do you hope this world will remember you as? What do you hope your legacy will be?

1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:43.840
 I don't think of legacy as much as maybe most people think legacy.

1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:46.880
 No, it's kind of funny. I'm consciously living the present.

1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:52.320
 Many students tell me, oh, give us some career advice. I'm like, I'm the wrong person.

1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:55.120
 I've never made a career plan. I still have to make one.

1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:06.800
 It's funny to be both experiencing the past and the present and the future, but also consciously

1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:14.560
 living in the present. There's a conscious decision we can make to not worry about all that, which

1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:22.400
 again goes back to the I'm the lucky one kind of thing of living in the present and being happy

1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:29.040
 winning and being happy losing. And there's a certain freedom that comes with that. But again,

1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:38.960
 a certain sort of, I don't know, ephemerity of living for the present. But if you step back from

1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:48.800
 all of that, where basically my current modus operandis is live for the present, make every day

1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:56.080
 the best you can make, and just make the local blip of local maxima of the universe,

1:50:56.080 --> 1:51:00.960
 of the awesomeness of the planet and the town and the family that we live in,

1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:09.120
 both academic family and biological family. Make it a little more awesome by being generous

1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:13.040
 to your friends, being generous to the people around you, being kind to your enemies,

1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:20.560
 and just showing love all around. You can't be upset at people if you truly love them.

1:51:20.560 --> 1:51:25.600
 If somebody yells at you and insults you every time you say the slightest thing. And yet,

1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:31.280
 when you see them, you just see them with love. It's a beautiful feeling. It's like,

1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:36.160
 you know, I'm feeling exactly like when I look at my three year old who's like screaming,

1:51:36.800 --> 1:51:41.840
 even though I love her and I want her good, she's still screaming and saying, no, no, no, no, no.

1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:48.640
 And I'm like, I love you, genuinely love you. But I can, I can sort of kind of see that your

1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:55.520
 brain is kind of stuck in that little, you know, mode of anger. And, you know, there's

1:51:55.520 --> 1:52:01.760
 plenty of people out there who don't like me and I see them with love as a child that is stuck

1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:07.440
 in a cognitive state that they're eventually going to snap out of, or maybe not. And that's

1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:15.040
 okay. So there's that aspect of sort of, you know, experiencing, you know, life with the best

1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:22.000
 best intentions. And, you know, I love when I'm wrong. I had a friend who was like one of the

1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:26.320
 smartest people I've ever met, who would basically say, Oh, I love it when I'm wrong, because it

1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:32.640
 makes me feel human. And it's so beautiful. I mean, she's really one of the smartest people I've

1:52:32.640 --> 1:52:40.560
 ever met. And she's like, it's such a good feeling. And I love being wrong. But there's, you know,

1:52:40.560 --> 1:52:45.680
 there's something about self improvement. There's something about sort of, how do I not make the

1:52:45.680 --> 1:52:51.760
 most mistakes, but attempt the most rights and do the fewest wrongs. But with the full knowledge

1:52:51.760 --> 1:52:59.280
 that this will happen. That's one aspect. So, so, so through this life in the present,

1:53:00.080 --> 1:53:03.760
 what's really funny is, and that's something that I've experienced more and more,

1:53:04.560 --> 1:53:10.480
 really thanks to you. And through this podcast is this enormous number of people who will basically

1:53:10.480 --> 1:53:16.800
 comment, wow, I've been following this guy for so many years now, or, wow, this guy has inspired so

1:53:16.800 --> 1:53:21.200
 many of us in computational biology. And so and so forth. I'm like, I don't know any of that.

1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:28.000
 But I'm only discovering this now through these sort of sharing our emotional states and our

1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:34.320
 cognitive states with a wider audience, where suddenly, I'm sort of realizing that, wow, maybe

1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:42.080
 I've had a legacy. Yes. Like, basically, I've trained generations of students from MIT. And I've

1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:49.600
 put all of my courses freely online since 2001. So basically, all of my video recordings of my

1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:56.160
 lectures have been online since 2001. So countless generations of people from across the world will

1:53:56.160 --> 1:54:00.880
 meet me at a conference and say, like, there was this conference where somebody heard my voice

1:54:00.880 --> 1:54:05.520
 and it's like, I know this voice, I've been listening to your lectures. And it's just such a

1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:12.960
 beautiful thing where like, we're sharing widely. And who knows, which students will get where

1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:18.640
 from whatever they catch out of these lectures, even if what they catch is just inspiration and

1:54:18.640 --> 1:54:27.360
 passion and drive. So there's this intangible, you know, legacy, quote unquote, that every one of

1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:32.000
 us has through the people we touch. One of my friends from undergrad basically told me, oh,

1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:35.920
 my mom remembers you vividly from when she came to campus, I'm like, I didn't even meet her.

1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:40.800
 She's like, no, but she she sort of saw you interacting with people and said, wow,

1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:46.640
 he's exuding this positive energy. And there's there's that aspect of sort of just motivating

1:54:46.640 --> 1:54:51.920
 people with your kindness, with your passion, with your generosity, and with your, you know,

1:54:51.920 --> 1:54:57.760
 just selflessness of, you know, just, just, just give doesn't matter where it goes.

1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:02.960
 I've been to conferences where basically people, you know, I'll ask them a question,

1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:06.240
 and then they'll come back to or like, there was a company where I asked somebody a question,

1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:10.480
 they said, oh, in fact, this entire project was inspired by your question three years ago at

1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:15.920
 the same conference. Wow. And then on top of that, there's also the ripple effect. So the year

1:55:15.920 --> 1:55:21.440
 speaking to the direct influence of inspiration or education, but there's also like, the follow

1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:26.400
 on things that happen to that. And there's this ripple that through from you, just this one individual

1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:31.440
 and from every one of us, from everyone, that's what I love about humanity. The fact that

1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:40.320
 every one of us shares genes and genetic variants with very recent ancestors with everyone else.

1:55:40.880 --> 1:55:47.280
 So even if I die tomorrow, my genes are still shared through my cousins and through my uncles

1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:52.640
 and through my, you know, immediate family. And of course, I'm lucky enough to have my own children.

1:55:52.640 --> 1:55:57.040
 But even if you don't, your genes are still permeating through all of the layers of your

1:55:57.040 --> 1:56:02.800
 family. So your genes will have the legacy there. Yeah. Oh, every one of us. Yeah. Number two,

1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:07.760
 our ideas are constantly intermingling with each other. So there's no person living in the planet

1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:13.520
 100 years from now, who will not be directly impacted by every one of the planet living here

1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:20.400
 today through genetic inheritance and through meme inheritance. That's cool to think that your ideas,

1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:27.680
 Manolis Callis would touch every single person on this planet. It's interesting.

1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:33.200
 But not just mine. Joe Smith, who's looking at this right now, his ideas will also touch everybody.

1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:40.400
 So there's this interconnectedness of humanity. And then I'm also a professor. So my day job

1:56:40.400 --> 1:56:46.960
 is legacy. My day job is training, not just the thousands of people who watch my videos on the

1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:54.400
 web, but the people who are actually in my class, who basically come to MIT to learn from a bunch

1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:59.520
 of us like the cognitive systems that were shipped to this particular location and who will then

1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:05.040
 disperse back into all of their home countries. That's what makes America the beacon of the world.

1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:14.640
 We don't just export goods. We export people, cognitive systems. We export people who are born

1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:20.800
 here. And we also export training that people born elsewhere will come here to get and will then

1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:26.400
 disseminate not just whatever knowledge they got, but whatever ideals they learned. And I think

1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:31.600
 that's something that's a legacy of the US that you cannot stop with political isolation. You cannot

1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:36.400
 stop with economic isolation. That's something that will continue to happen through all the people

1:57:36.400 --> 1:57:41.600
 we've touched through our universities. So there's the students who took my classes who are basically

1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:46.320
 now going off and teaching their classes. And I've trained generations of computation biologists.

1:57:46.320 --> 1:57:52.160
 No one in genomics who's gone through MIT hasn't taken my class. So basically there's this impact

1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:56.400
 through, I mean, there's so many people in biotechs who are like, Hey, I took your class. That's what

1:57:56.400 --> 1:58:03.360
 I've got into the field like 15 years ago. It's just so beautiful. And then there's the academic

1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:09.120
 family that I have. So the students who are actually studying with me, who are my trainees.

1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:16.880
 So this sort of mentorship of ancient Greece. So I basically have an academic family.

1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:26.480
 And we are a family. There's this such strong connection, this bond of you're part of the

1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:32.240
 Kelly's family. So I have a biological family at home. And I have an academic family on campus.

1:58:32.240 --> 1:58:38.720
 And that academic family has given me great grandchildren already. Yes. So I've trained

1:58:38.720 --> 1:58:44.320
 people who are now professors at Stanford team, you Harvard, you know, what you I mean, everywhere

1:58:44.320 --> 1:58:52.240
 in the world. And these people have now trained people who are now having their own faculty jobs.

1:58:52.960 --> 1:58:56.320
 So there's basically people who see me as their academic grandfather.

1:58:57.200 --> 1:59:01.200
 And it's just so beautiful because you don't have to wait for the 18 years of cognitive,

1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:07.360
 you know, hardware development to sort of have amazing conversation with people that

1:59:07.360 --> 1:59:14.240
 you're fully grown humans, fully grown adult, who are, you know, cognitively super ready. And who

1:59:14.240 --> 1:59:19.920
 are shaped by and you know, I see some of these beautiful papers and like, I can see the touch

1:59:19.920 --> 1:59:25.120
 of our lab in those papers. It's just so beautiful because you're like, I spent hours with these

1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:30.960
 people teaching them not just how to do a paper, but how to think. And this whole concept of,

1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:36.480
 you know, the first paper that we write together is an experience with every one of these students.

1:59:37.440 --> 1:59:41.520
 So, you know, I always tell them to write the whole first draft. And they know that I will

1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:47.520
 rewrite every word. But but the act of them writing it. And what I do is these like joint

1:59:47.520 --> 1:59:53.360
 editing sessions where I'm like, let's co edit. And with this co editing, we basically have creative

1:59:53.360 --> 1:59:59.520
 destruction. So I share my zoom screen. And I'm just thinking out loud, as I'm doing this,

1:59:59.520 --> 2:00:03.120
 and they're learning from that process, as opposed to like, come back two days later and

2:00:03.120 --> 2:00:08.400
 they see a bunch of red on a page. I'm sort of, well, that's not how you write this. That's not

2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:11.600
 how you think about this. That's not, you know, what's the point like this morning was having.

2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:17.520
 Yes, this morning between six and eight a.m. I had a two hour meeting going through one of these

2:00:17.520 --> 2:00:23.120
 papers. And then saying, what's the point here? Why do you even show that? It's just a bunch of

2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:27.680
 points on a graph. No, what you have to do is extract the meaning, do the homework for them.

2:00:27.680 --> 2:00:34.880
 And there's this nurturing this mentorship that sort of creates now a legacy, which is

2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:41.360
 infinite, because they've now gone off on the, you know, and and all of that is just humanity.

2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:48.080
 Then, of course, there's a paper that right. Because yes, my day job is training students,

2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:55.040
 but it's a research university. The way that they learn is through the men's and Manu's mind and

2:00:55.040 --> 2:01:02.720
 hand. It's the practical training of actually doing research. And that research is a beneficial

2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:09.920
 side effect of having these awesome papers that will now tell other people how to think.

2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:14.640
 There's this paper we just posted recently on Metarchive. And one of the most generous

2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:20.800
 and eloquent comments about it was like, wow, this is a masterclass in scientific writing,

2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:26.720
 in analysis, in biological interpretation and so forth. It's just so fulfilling from a person

2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:31.680
 I've never met or heard of. Can you say the title of the paper? I don't remember the title,

2:01:31.680 --> 2:01:39.760
 but it's single cell dissection of schizophrenia reveals. So the two, the two points that we found

2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:45.440
 was this whole transcriptional resilience, like there's some individuals who are schizophrenic,

2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:52.720
 but who have an additional cell type or initial cell state, which we believe is protective.

2:01:53.440 --> 2:01:58.000
 And that cell state, when they have it, will cause other cells to have normal gene expression

2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:06.160
 patterns. It's beautiful. And then that cell is connected with some of the PV interneurons that

2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:12.560
 are basically sending these inhibitory brain waves through the brain. And basically,

2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:18.800
 there's another component of, there's a set of master regulators that we discovered who are

2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:23.840
 controlling many of the genes that are differentially expressed. And these master regulators are

2:02:23.840 --> 2:02:30.160
 themselves genetic targets of schizophrenia. And they are themselves involved in both synaptic

2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:37.600
 connectivity and also in early brain development. So there's this sort of interconnectedness between

2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:42.720
 synaptic development axis and also this transcription resilience. So I mean, we basically made up a

2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:46.800
 title that combines all these concepts. You have all these concepts, all these people working together

2:02:46.800 --> 2:02:52.240
 and ultimately these minds connect down into a beautifully written little document that lives

2:02:52.240 --> 2:03:00.320
 on forever. And that document now has its own life. Our work has 120,000 citations. I mean,

2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:05.600
 that's not just people who read it. These are people who used it to write something based on it.

2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:13.040
 I mean, that to me is just so fulfilling to basically say, wow, I've touched people. So

2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:19.520
 I don't think of my legacy as I live every day. I just think of the beauty of the present

2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:25.840
 and the power of interconnectedness. And just, I feel like a kid in a candy shop where I'm just

2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:33.040
 like constantly, you know, where do I, what package do I open first? And you know,

2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:36.960
 the lucky one. A jack of all trades, a master of none.

2:03:37.840 --> 2:03:43.840
 I think for a meaning of life episode, we would be amiss if we did not have at least

2:03:43.840 --> 2:03:50.960
 a poem or two. Do you mind if we end in a couple of poems? Maybe a happy, maybe a sad one.

2:03:50.960 --> 2:03:56.720
 I would love that. So thank you for the luxury. The first one is kind of,

2:03:56.720 --> 2:04:06.880
 I remember when you were talking with Eric Weinstein about this comment

2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:12.560
 of Leonard Cohen that says, but you don't really care for music, do you? In hallelujah.

2:04:12.560 --> 2:04:17.920
 That's basically kind of like mocking its reader. So one of my poems is a little like that.

2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:25.360
 So I had just broken up with, you know, my girlfriend and there's this other friend

2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:29.840
 who was coming to visit me. And she said, I will not come unless you write me a poem.

2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:40.240
 And I was like, writing a poem on demand. So this poem is called, write me a poem.

2:04:40.800 --> 2:04:46.480
 It goes, write me a poem, she said with a smile. Make sure it's pretty, romantic and rimes.

2:04:47.040 --> 2:04:51.760
 Make sure it's worthy of that bold flame that love uniting us beyond a mere game.

2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:56.800
 And she took off without more words, rushed for the bus and traveled the world.

2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:02.240
 A poem, I thought, this is sublime. What better way for passing the time?

2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:07.440
 What better way to count up the hours before she comes back to my lonely tower?

2:05:08.400 --> 2:05:12.240
 Waiting for joy to fill up my heart? Let's write a poem for when we're apart.

2:05:13.120 --> 2:05:17.760
 How does a poem start? I inquired. Give me a topic, cook up a style.

2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:22.560
 Throw in some cute words, oh, here and there. Throw in some passion, love and despair.

2:05:23.680 --> 2:05:28.560
 Love, three eggs, one pound of flour, three cups of water and bake for an hour.

2:05:29.680 --> 2:05:34.000
 Love is no recipe, as I understand. You can't just cook up a poem on demand.

2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:39.840
 And as I was twisting all this in my mind, I looked at the page. By golly, it rhymed.

2:05:40.800 --> 2:05:45.840
 Three roses, white chocolate, vanilla powder, some beautiful rhymes and maybe a flower.

2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:50.880
 No, be romantic, the young girl insisted. Do this, do that, don't be so silly.

2:05:50.880 --> 2:05:55.440
 You must believe it straight from your heart. If you don't feel it, we're better apart.

2:05:57.200 --> 2:06:01.920
 Oh, my sweet thing, what can I say? You bring me the sun all night and all day.

2:06:02.720 --> 2:06:07.440
 You're the stars and the moon and the birds way up high. You're my evening sweet song,

2:06:07.440 --> 2:06:13.520
 my morning blue sky. You are my muse. Your spell has me caught. You bring me my voice

2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:20.240
 and scatter my thoughts. To put love in writing, in vain, I can try. But when I'm with you,

2:06:20.240 --> 2:06:26.960
 my wings want to fly. So I put down the pen and drop my defenses, give myself to you,

2:06:26.960 --> 2:06:28.160
 and fill up my senses.

2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:34.080
 The baffle king composing hallelujah. That was beautiful.

2:06:34.880 --> 2:06:40.480
 What I love about it is that I did not bring up a dictionary of rhymes. I did not sort of

2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:46.480
 work hard. So basically, when I write poems, I just type. I never go back. I just,

2:06:48.160 --> 2:06:52.640
 so when my brain gets into that mode, it actually happens like I wrote it.

2:06:52.640 --> 2:06:55.680
 Oh, wow. So the rhymes just kind of, it's an emergent phenomenon.

2:06:55.680 --> 2:07:00.800
 It's an emergent phenomenon. I just get into that mode and then it comes up.

2:07:00.800 --> 2:07:01.920
 That's a beautiful one.

2:07:01.920 --> 2:07:08.160
 And it's basically, you know, as you got it, it's basically saying it's no recipe and then

2:07:08.160 --> 2:07:13.520
 I'm throwing the recipes. And as I'm writing it, I'm like, you know, so it's very introspective

2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:21.520
 in this whole concept. So anyway, there's another one many years earlier that is,

2:07:22.240 --> 2:07:27.040
 you know, darker. It's basically this whole concept of let's be friends. I was like,

2:07:29.680 --> 2:07:34.800
 no, let's be friends. Just like, you know, so the last words are shout out, I love you or send

2:07:34.800 --> 2:07:45.840
 me to hell. So the title is burn me tonight. Lie to me, baby. Lie to me now. Tell me you love me.

2:07:45.840 --> 2:07:51.840
 Break me a vow. Give me a sweet word. I promise a kiss. Give me the world a sweet taste to miss.

2:07:52.560 --> 2:07:58.320
 Don't let me lay here inert, ugly, cold. With nothing sweet felt and nothing harsh told.

2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:04.240
 Give me some hope, false, foolish, yet kind. Make me regret. I'll leave you behind.

2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:10.320
 Don't pity my soul, but torture it right. Treat it with hatred. Start up a fight.

2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:17.520
 For it's from mildness that my soul dies when you cover your passion in a bland friend's disguise.

2:08:18.480 --> 2:08:22.800
 Kiss me now, baby. Show me your passion. Turn off the lights and rip off your fashion.

2:08:22.800 --> 2:08:29.200
 Give me my life's joy this one night. Burn all my matches for one blazing light.

2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:34.640
 Don't think of tomorrow and let today fade. Don't try and protect me from love's cutting blade.

2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:41.040
 Your razor will always rip off my veins. Don't spare me the passion to spare me the pains.

2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:46.720
 Kiss me now, honey, or spit in my face. Throw me an insult I'll gladly embrace.

2:08:47.520 --> 2:08:52.000
 Tell me now clearly that you never cared. Say it now loudly like you never dared.

2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:57.760
 I'm ready to hear it. I'm ready to die. I'm ready to burn and start a new life.

2:08:58.320 --> 2:09:03.360
 I'm ready to face the rough burning truth rather than waste the rest of my youth.

2:09:04.240 --> 2:09:09.040
 So tell me, my lover, should I stay or go? The answer to love is one, yes or no.

2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:14.800
 There's no I like you, no let's be friends. Shout out I love you or send me to hell.

2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:23.680
 I don't think there's a better way to end a discussion of the meaning of life. Whatever

2:09:23.680 --> 2:09:30.080
 the heck the meaning is, go all in as that poem says Manolis. Thank you so much for talking to

2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:35.040

 And now let me leave you with some words from Douglas Adams in his book Hitchhiker's Guide to

2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:22.080
 the Galaxy. On the planet earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins

2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:30.400
 because he had achieved so much. The wheel, New York, wars, and so on. Whilst all the dolphins

2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:37.520
 had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always

2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:43.520
 believed that they were far more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons.

2:10:43.520 --> 2:11:07.520
 Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
