 The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan that we recorded after my recent

00:05.280 --> 00:08.200
 appearance on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.

00:08.880 --> 00:14.640
 Joe has been an inspiration to me and I think to millions of people for just

00:14.640 --> 00:18.680
 being somebody who puts love out there in the world and being genuinely

00:18.680 --> 00:24.080
 curious about wild ideas from chimps and psychedelics to quantum

00:24.080 --> 00:26.120
 mechanics and artificial intelligence.

00:26.120 --> 00:31.760
 Like many of you, I've been a fan of his podcast for over a decade and now

00:32.000 --> 00:37.720
 somehow miraculously I'm humbled to be able to call him a friend.

00:38.280 --> 00:41.400

01:07.760 --> 01:11.440
 I usually do full ad reads here and never ads in the middle, but this time

01:11.440 --> 01:25.840
 let's go straight to the conversation with a bit of guitar first.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.840
 Do you ponder your mortality?

01:56.080 --> 01:56.960
 Are you afraid of death?

01:57.840 --> 01:59.440
 I do think about it sometimes.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.200
 I mean, it does pop into my head sometimes.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.480
 Just the fact that, uh, I mean, I'm 53.

02:04.920 --> 02:09.440
 So if everything goes great, I have less than 50 years left.

02:09.440 --> 02:14.160
 You know, if everything goes great, like no car accidents, no injuries.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.000
 But it could happen today.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.200
 This could be your last day.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.000
 It could be.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.960
 That's kind of a stoic thing to meditate on death.

02:21.440 --> 02:26.560
 There's a bunch of philosophers, Ernest Becker and Sheldon Solomon.

02:26.560 --> 02:32.080
 They believe that death is at the core of everything, wrote this book, Warm at the Core.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.360
 So does that come into play in the way you see the world?

02:35.360 --> 02:40.640
 I think having a sense of urgency is very beneficial and understanding that your time

02:40.640 --> 02:42.640
 is limited can aid you greatly.

02:42.960 --> 02:48.800
 I think, uh, knowing that this is a temporary time that we have finite lifespans,

02:49.360 --> 02:55.120
 I think there's a, there's great power in that because it motivates you.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.080
 It gets you going.

02:56.480 --> 03:00.560
 I think being an immortal living forever would be one of the most depressing things,

03:00.560 --> 03:02.640
 particularly if everybody else was dying around you.

03:02.640 --> 03:08.000
 And I think one of the things that makes life so interesting and fascinating is that

03:08.000 --> 03:12.560
 it doesn't last, you know, that you, you really get a brief amount of time here.

03:12.800 --> 03:17.280
 And really by the time you're just starting to kind of figure yourself out who you are

03:17.280 --> 03:20.880
 and how not to screw things up so bad, like time's up.

03:20.880 --> 03:21.600
 The ride's over.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.880
 What about from your, like, from your daughter's perspective?

03:26.160 --> 03:31.840
 Do you, do you, uh, think about the world we're in now and what kind of world we're in

03:31.840 --> 03:33.680
 and what kind of world you're going to leave them?

03:35.120 --> 03:35.600
 I do.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.800
 And do you worry about it?

03:36.800 --> 03:37.600
 I do.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.480
 Yeah, I do.

03:38.480 --> 03:43.360
 I do when I see these, uh, protests and riots and chaos and so much,

03:45.680 --> 03:48.320
 so much, uh, anger in the world today.

03:48.320 --> 03:53.040
 And then particularly today, I think because of the pandemic and the fact that

03:53.600 --> 03:59.280
 so many folks are out of work and through no fault of their own and can't make ends meet.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.080
 And just people feel so helpless and angry.

04:02.640 --> 04:06.640
 It's, uh, a particularly divisive time.

04:06.640 --> 04:10.320
 It's a particularly turmoil filled time.

04:10.320 --> 04:14.080
 And, uh, it just doesn't seem like the world of a year ago even,

04:14.640 --> 04:17.440
 it feels very chaotic and dangerous.

04:17.440 --> 04:22.000
 And this, and it's a small thing, like in terms of the, like the possibilities of things that

04:22.000 --> 04:25.760
 could happen to the world, like a pandemic, like the one we've experienced, it really just

04:25.760 --> 04:28.880
 doubles the amount of deaths on a bad flu year.

04:28.880 --> 04:32.720
 So it's relatively speaking is a small thing comparison to

04:34.240 --> 04:41.200
 super volcano eruptions, asteroid impact, uh, a real horrific pandemic or one that,

04:41.200 --> 04:44.880
 you know, really wipes out millions and millions of people.

04:45.840 --> 04:50.240
 It's, um, it's stunning how fragile civility is.

04:50.240 --> 04:56.880
 It's stunning how fragile our, our, our society really is that something like this can come along

04:56.880 --> 05:00.720
 some unprecedented thing, unprecedented thing can come along and all of a sudden everybody's

05:00.720 --> 05:04.800
 out of work for six months and then everybody's at each other's throats and then politically,

05:04.800 --> 05:06.080
 everyone's at each other's throats.

05:06.080 --> 05:12.160
 And, and then with the advent of social media and, uh, the images that you can see,

05:12.160 --> 05:18.880
 you know, with the videos of police abuse and just racial tensions are at an all time high.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.960
 To a point where like, if you asked me just five or six years ago,

05:22.960 --> 05:28.480
 like our, have racial problems in this country largely been alleviated,

05:28.480 --> 05:31.120
 I'd probably say, yeah, it's way better than it's ever been before.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.640
 But now you could argue that it's not.

05:32.640 --> 05:36.400
 Now you could argue it's no, it's way worse and, and just a small amount of time.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.200
 It's way worse than it's ever been during my lifetime.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.280
 You cut while, while I'm aware of it.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.320
 You know, obviously when I was a young boy in the sixties,

05:44.320 --> 05:46.160
 they were still going through the civil rights movement.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.440
 But now, uh, it just seems very fever pitched.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.960
 And I think a lot of that is because of the pandemic and is because of all the,

05:54.960 --> 05:58.160
 the heightened, uh, just tension.

05:58.160 --> 06:03.920
 The, what, what I likened it to is, um, Pete, road rage, because, you know,

06:03.920 --> 06:07.920
 people have road rage, not just because they're in the car and no one can get to them,

06:07.920 --> 06:12.160
 but also because you're at a heightened state because you're driving fast and you know,

06:12.160 --> 06:14.800
 you're driving fast, you know, you have to make split second movements.

06:14.800 --> 06:19.600
 And so anybody doing something, you're like, what the, people go crazy because they're,

06:19.600 --> 06:23.440
 they're already at an eight because they're in the car and they're moving very quickly.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.000
 That's what it feels like with today, with the pandemic.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.560
 It feels like everybody is already at an eight.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.960
 So anything that comes along, it's like light it all on fire, you know, burn it down.

06:32.960 --> 06:38.320
 Like that's part of what I think is part of the reason for a lot of the looting and the riots

06:38.320 --> 06:39.520
 and all the chaos.

06:39.520 --> 06:45.680
 It's not just the people out of work, but it's also that everyone feels so tense already.

06:45.680 --> 06:52.080
 And everyone feels so helpless and it's like, you know, doing something like that makes people,

06:53.280 --> 07:02.400
 it just, it gives people a whole new motivation for chaos, a whole new motivation for

07:03.680 --> 07:07.200
 doing destructive things that I've never experienced in my life.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.760
 And your better days when you see a positive future, what do you think is the way out

07:11.760 --> 07:15.040
 of this chaos of 2020?

07:15.040 --> 07:19.600
 Like if you visualize a 2025, that's a better world than today.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.400
 What is that?

07:20.400 --> 07:22.080
 How do we get there and what does that look like?

07:22.080 --> 07:22.880
 It's a good question.

07:25.840 --> 07:32.480
 I can honestly say I don't know and I wouldn't have said I don't know a year ago.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.640
 A year ago, I would have said we're going to be okay.

07:34.640 --> 07:37.760
 As much as people hate Trump, the economy is doing great.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.200
 I think we're going to be fine.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.120
 That's not how I feel today.

07:41.120 --> 07:47.120
 Today, I don't think there's a clear solution politically because I think if Trump wins,

07:47.120 --> 07:48.400
 people are going to be furious.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.640
 And I think if Biden wins, people are going to be furious.

07:52.160 --> 07:58.400
 Particularly like if things get more woke, you know, if people continue to enforce

07:59.760 --> 08:04.640
 force compliance and make people behave a certain way and act a certain way, which seems

08:04.640 --> 08:10.080
 to be a part of what this whole woke thing is that is the most disturbing for me is that I see

08:10.080 --> 08:16.160
 what's going on. I see there's a lot of losers that have hopped on this and they shove it in

08:16.160 --> 08:18.000
 people's faces and it doesn't have to make sense.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.200
 It's like there was a Black Lives Matter protest that stopped this woman at a restaurant.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.040
 They were surrounding her outside a restaurant.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.320
 They were forcing her to raise her fist in compliance.

08:28.320 --> 08:34.080
 This is a woman who's marched for Black Lives Matter multiple times and the people around

08:34.080 --> 08:35.200
 her doing this were all white.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.040
 It's all weird.

08:37.040 --> 08:40.560
 My friend Coach T, he's a wrestling coach who's also on a podcast.

08:40.560 --> 08:44.960
 My friend Brian Moses, his take on it is that Black, and he's a Black guy.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.640
 He says Black Lives Matter is a white cult.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.520
 And I'm like, when you see that picture, it's hard to argue that he's got a point.

08:52.080 --> 08:56.880
 I mean, it's clearly not all about that, but there's a lot of people that have jumped on

08:56.880 --> 09:00.640
 board that are very much like cult members.

09:00.640 --> 09:06.400
 Because the thing about Black Lives Matter or any movement is you can't control who joins.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.400
 There's no entrance examination.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.240
 So you don't go, okay, how do you feel about this?

09:12.240 --> 09:13.440
 What's your perceptions on that?

09:15.040 --> 09:19.840
 The man who shot the Trump supporter in Portland, that guy who murdered the Trump

09:19.840 --> 09:25.760
 supporter then the cop shot him, that guy was walking around with his hand on his gun

09:25.760 --> 09:32.320
 looking for Trump supporters, I mean, he's a known violent guy who was walking around

09:32.320 --> 09:34.560
 looking for Trump supporters, found one and shot one.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.720
 That has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.320
 He's a white guy, he shot another white guy.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.840
 It's just madness.

09:40.880 --> 09:47.200
 That kind of madness is disturbing to see it ramp up so quickly.

09:48.240 --> 09:54.880
 There's been riots in Portland every night, excuse me, demonstrations, for 101 days now.

09:54.880 --> 09:59.680
 101 days in a row of them lighting things on fire, breaking into federal buildings.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.320
 It's like, who ever saw that coming?

10:02.320 --> 10:03.280
 Nobody saw that coming.

10:03.280 --> 10:09.200
 So I don't know what the solution is and I don't know what it looks like in five years.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.720
 So 2025, to answer your question, there could be anything.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.560
 I mean, we could be looking at Mad Max.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.560
 We could be looking at the apocalypse.

10:16.560 --> 10:20.320
 We could also be looking at an invasion from another country.

10:20.320 --> 10:27.120
 We could be looking at a war, like a real hot war to put a little bit of responsibility on you.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.640
 Like for me, I've listened to you since the red band Olive Garden days,

10:31.280 --> 10:33.200
 that's the very beginning.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.560
 And there was something in the way you communicated about the world.

10:36.560 --> 10:41.280
 Maybe there was others, but you're the one I was aware of is you're open minded and

10:42.560 --> 10:45.600
 like loving towards the world, especially as the podcast developed.

10:45.600 --> 10:51.520
 Like you just demonstrated and lived this kind of just kindness,

10:51.520 --> 10:55.680
 or maybe even like lack of jealousy in your own little profession of comedy.

10:55.680 --> 11:01.920
 It was clear that you didn't succumb to the weaker aspects of human nature

11:01.920 --> 11:06.720
 and thereby inspire like people like me, who I was naturally,

11:06.720 --> 11:11.840
 probably especially in the early 20s, kind of jealous on the success of others.

11:11.840 --> 11:19.200
 And you're really the primary person that taught me to truly celebrate the success of others.

11:19.920 --> 11:25.920
 And so by way of question, you kind of have a role in this of making a better 2025.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.760
 You have such a big megaphone.

11:27.760 --> 11:32.480
 Is there something you think you can do on this podcast with the words,

11:33.600 --> 11:38.640
 the way you talk, the things you discuss that could create a better 2025?

11:38.640 --> 11:43.600
 I think if anything, I could help in leading by example,

11:44.400 --> 11:48.880
 but that's only going to help the people that are listening.

11:49.920 --> 11:54.560
 I don't know what else I can do in terms of like make the world a better place other than

11:56.240 --> 12:03.440
 express my hopes and wishes for that and just try to be as nice as I can to people as often as I can.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.960
 But I also think that I've fallen into this weird category,

12:06.960 --> 12:12.160
 particularly with the Spotify deal, where I'm one of them now.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.960
 I'm not a regular person anymore.

12:14.960 --> 12:18.560
 Now I'm like some famous rich guy.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.760
 So you go from being a regular person to a famous rich guy that's out of touch.

12:22.960 --> 12:30.400
 And that's a real issue whenever you're talking about the economy, about just real life problems.

12:31.280 --> 12:31.840
 It's interesting.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.440
 It kind of hurts my heart to hear people say about Elon Musk, he's just a billionaire.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.320
 Yeah.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.760
 It's an interesting statement.

12:38.400 --> 12:42.560
 But I think if you just continue being you and he continued being him,

12:43.280 --> 12:49.520
 people are just voicing their worry that he becomes some rich guy.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.960
 I don't even know if they're doing that.

12:51.520 --> 12:55.520
 I think they're just finding the way he describes it, an attack vector.

12:56.160 --> 12:56.720
 Right.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.080
 Yeah, and I think he's right.

12:58.080 --> 13:03.040
 I think they can dismiss you by just saying, oh, you're just a that.

13:03.040 --> 13:07.680
 You know, you're easily definable.

13:07.680 --> 13:08.400
 Right.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.920
 But there, I mean, there's truth to that.

13:09.920 --> 13:15.600
 If you're not careful, you can become out of touch, but that's an interesting thing.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.320
 Like why haven't you become out of touch?

13:18.320 --> 13:25.680
 Like as a human off the podcast, you talk to somebody like me.

13:25.680 --> 13:30.240
 You don't talk like a famous person or you don't act rich.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.000
 Like you're better than others.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.960
 There's a certain, listen, I've talked to quite a few, you have two, but I've talked

13:36.960 --> 13:40.800
 to especially kind of group of people that are like Nobel Prize winners, let's say.

13:40.800 --> 13:46.160
 They have sometimes have an air to them that's of arrogance and you don't.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.440
 What's that about?

13:47.440 --> 13:50.000
 Well, you got to know what that is, right?

13:50.000 --> 13:55.600
 Like that air of arrogance comes from drinking your own Kool Aid.

13:55.600 --> 14:00.320
 You start believing that somehow or another, just because you're getting praise from all

14:00.320 --> 14:02.800
 these people that you really are something different.

14:02.800 --> 14:08.800
 Usually it exemplifies, there's something there where there's a lack of struggle.

14:08.800 --> 14:20.640
 You know, and I think struggle is probably one of the most important balancing tools

14:20.640 --> 14:22.160
 that a person can have.

14:22.160 --> 14:29.120
 That a person can have and for me, I struggle mentally and I struggle physically.

14:29.120 --> 14:33.360
 I struggle mentally in that, like we were talking about on the podcast we did previously.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.600
 You and I on my podcast said, I'm not a fan of my work.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.800
 I'm not a fan of what I do.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.880
 I'm my harshest critic.

14:40.880 --> 14:46.320
 So anytime anybody says something bad about me, I'm like, listen, I said way worse about

14:46.320 --> 14:54.720
 myself, I don't like anything I do, I'm ruthlessly introspective and I will continue to be that way

14:54.720 --> 14:56.960
 because that's the only way you could be good as a comedian.

14:56.960 --> 14:57.840
 There's no other way.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.840
 You can't just think you're awesome and just go out there.

14:59.840 --> 15:04.080
 You have to be like picking apart everything you do, but there's a balance to that too

15:04.080 --> 15:06.160
 because you have to have enough confidence to go out there and perform.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.400
 You can't think, oh my God, I suck.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.440
 I know what I'm doing, but I know what I'm doing because I put in all that work.

15:11.440 --> 15:16.160
 And one of the reasons why I put in all that work is I don't like the end

15:16.160 --> 15:17.360
 result most of the time.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.960
 So I need to work at it all the time.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.960
 And then there's physical struggle, which I think balances everything out.

15:23.760 --> 15:29.600
 Without physical struggle, I always make the analogy that the body is in a lot of ways like

15:29.600 --> 15:35.760
 a battery where if you have extra charge, it's like it leaks out of the top and it becomes

15:35.760 --> 15:37.440
 unmanageable and messy.

15:37.440 --> 15:45.360
 And that's how my psyche is if I have too much energy, if I'm not exerting myself in a

15:45.360 --> 15:49.840
 violent way, like an explosive way, like wearing myself out.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.560
 I just don't like the way the world is.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.480
 I don't like the way I interface with the world.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.280
 I'm too tense.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.600
 I'm too quick to be upset about things.

16:00.320 --> 16:07.040
 But when I work out hard and I put in a brutal training session, everything's fine.

16:07.040 --> 16:16.160
 Well, the first time I talked to you on Jerry, you were doing sober October and there's

16:16.160 --> 16:17.120
 something in your eyes.

16:18.480 --> 16:22.800
 Like I think you've talked about that you exercise the demons out essentially.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.720
 So you exercise to get whatever the parts of you that you don't like out.

16:27.680 --> 16:33.920
 There's a darkness in you there, like the competitiveness and the focus of that person.

16:33.920 --> 16:40.080
 And that was a scary time in a lot of ways, that sober October thing because my friends,

16:40.080 --> 16:41.280
 we're all talking shit, right?

16:41.280 --> 16:44.480
 Because we're competing against each other in these fitness challenges.

16:44.480 --> 16:52.160
 And you had one point, like you got a certain amount of points for each minute that you went

16:52.160 --> 16:54.400
 at 80% of your max heart rate.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.360
 And one day I got 1,100 points.

16:57.360 --> 17:03.440
 So I did seven hours on an elliptical machine watching the bathhouse scene from John Wick,

17:03.440 --> 17:04.800
 where he murders all those people in the bathhouse.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.400
 I watched him probably 50 times in a row.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.240
 I went crazy.

17:08.240 --> 17:15.360
 I went crazy, but I went crazy in a weird way where it brought me back to my fighting days.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.080
 It was like the same, that person came out again.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.080
 It was like, well, I didn't even know he was in there.

17:20.080 --> 17:25.680
 It's like there, like an assassin, like a killer.

17:25.680 --> 17:31.440
 Like I felt like a different person.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.360
 Is it echoes of like what Mike Tyson talked about, essentially, like the...

17:35.360 --> 17:37.520
 Maybe, but no orgasmic notions.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.960
 That was the craziest shit that he was saying.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.920
 Is there a violent person in there?

17:43.920 --> 17:47.680
 Oh yeah, there's a lot of violence in me for sure.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.160
 I don't know if it's genetic or learned or...

17:50.160 --> 17:56.000
 It's because during my formative years from the time I was 15 until I was 22, all I did was fight.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.000
 That was all I did.

17:58.000 --> 17:58.960
 That was all I did.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.880
 All I did was train and compete.

18:00.880 --> 18:01.680
 That's all I did.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.880
 That was my whole life.

18:02.880 --> 18:03.840
 Is it connected to...

18:04.720 --> 18:07.600
 So your mom and dad broke up early on.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.320
 Is it connected to the dad at all?

18:10.320 --> 18:16.160
 I'm sure it's connected to him also because he was violent and it made me feel very scared to be around him.

18:16.160 --> 18:22.640
 But I also think it's connected in who he was as a human is transferred into my DNA.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.360
 I think there's a certain amount of...

18:25.920 --> 18:30.320
 I mean, to be prejudice against myself,

18:30.320 --> 18:32.000
 I look like a violent person.

18:32.640 --> 18:36.720
 If I didn't know me, even the way I'm built, not even just the working out part,

18:36.720 --> 18:41.040
 just the size of my hands and the width of my shoulders.

18:41.040 --> 18:46.480
 There's most likely a lot of violence in my history, in my past, in my ancestry.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.920
 I think we minimize that with people.

18:52.720 --> 18:58.240
 So much of your behavior, when I see my daughter, I have one daughter that's obsessive

18:58.240 --> 19:00.320
 in terms of like she wants to get really good at things.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.120
 So I could she...

19:01.120 --> 19:06.720
 And she'll practice things all day long and it's 100% my personality.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.680
 Like she's me in a female form.

19:09.680 --> 19:16.480
 But without the anger as much and without the fear, like she has loving household and everything like that.

19:16.480 --> 19:23.360
 But she has this intense obsession with doing things and doing things really well and getting better.

19:23.360 --> 19:23.920
 What's the point?

19:23.920 --> 19:24.800
 We have to tell her, stop.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.480
 Like stop doing handsprings in the house.

19:26.480 --> 19:27.440
 Stop, stop.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.040
 Come on, just sit down, have dinner.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.000
 Like one more, one more.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.160
 She's psycho.

19:34.000 --> 19:43.840
 And I think there's a lot of behavior and personality and a lot of these things are

19:43.840 --> 19:45.600
 passed down through genetics.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.280
 We don't really know, right?

19:47.280 --> 19:54.400
 We don't know how much of who you are genetically is learned behavior, nature or nurture.

19:54.400 --> 19:59.360
 We don't know if it's learned behavior or whether or not it's something that's intrinsically a part

19:59.360 --> 20:01.920
 of you because of who your parents were.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.920
 I think there's certainly some genetic violence in me.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.680
 And then you channeled it.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.080
 Yeah.

20:08.080 --> 20:13.280
 So you figured out basically your life is a productive exploration of how to channel that.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.160
 Yes.

20:14.160 --> 20:21.040
 How to figure out how to get that monkey to sit down and calm down is another person in there.

20:21.040 --> 20:27.600
 Like there's a calm, rational, kind, friendly person who just wants to laugh and have fun.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.920
 And then there's that dude who comes out when I did sober October.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.440
 That guy's scary.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.720
 I don't like that guy.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.640
 That guy just wants to get up in the morning and go.

20:40.240 --> 20:44.160
 When I was competing, it was necessary, but it makes me remember.

20:44.160 --> 20:48.240
 I didn't really remember what I used to be like until that.

20:48.240 --> 20:54.560
 It's like when I'm working out seven hours a day and I'm just so obsessed and all I was

20:54.560 --> 20:55.680
 thinking about was winning.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.720
 That's all I was thinking about.

20:56.720 --> 21:01.120
 Like if they were working out five hours a day, I wanted them to know that I was going

21:01.120 --> 21:05.520
 to work out an extra three hours and I was going to get up early and I was going to text them all,

21:05.520 --> 21:08.560
 hey, pussies, I'm up already, take pictures, send selfies.

21:10.080 --> 21:10.880
 You're going to die.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.800
 Oh, I kept telling them, you're all going to die.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.760
 You try to keep up with me.

21:13.760 --> 21:14.720
 You're going to die.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.480
 You weren't fully joking.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.920
 No, I wasn't joking at all.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.120
 That's what was fucked up about it.

21:19.120 --> 21:24.480
 This is the scary thing when I interacted with Goggans and what I saw in you during that time

21:25.280 --> 21:31.760
 is this guy, this is why I've been avoiding David Goggans recently,

21:33.600 --> 21:39.200
 is because he wants to talk on this podcast, but he also wants to run an ultramarathon with me.

21:39.760 --> 21:45.280
 I felt like this is a person, if I spend any time in this realm, if I spend any time with

21:45.280 --> 21:50.320
 a Joe Rogan of that sober October, I might have to die to get out.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.360
 There's a competitive aspect that's super unhealthy.

21:55.360 --> 21:59.280
 I mean, you saw the video that we watched earlier today of Goggans draining his knee.

21:59.280 --> 22:03.120
 That would stop me from running ever again because I would think in my head, okay,

22:03.120 --> 22:04.400
 I'm going to ruin my cartilage.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.080
 I'm going to need a knee replacement.

22:06.080 --> 22:12.080
 I would start thinking, I would go down that line, but he is perpetually in this push it

22:12.080 --> 22:15.520
 mindset, what he calls the dog in him.

22:15.520 --> 22:22.320
 He's got, that dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dog and that's who he is.

22:22.320 --> 22:27.600
 That's one of the reasons why he's so inspirational and he's fuel for millions and millions of people.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.480
 I mean, he really is.

22:28.480 --> 22:34.640
 He motivates people in a way that is so powerful, but it can be very destructive.

22:35.920 --> 22:41.280
 I know now, especially after the sober October thing, that that thing's still in me.

22:41.280 --> 22:45.280
 I didn't know because I really haven't done anything physically competitive.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.840
 Except one time I was supposed to fight Wesley Snipes.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.200
 It came out then too.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.240
 That came out too.

22:50.240 --> 22:53.600
 That got creepy too, but luckily that never happened.

22:53.600 --> 22:59.520
 But that was many months of training, like training twice a day, every day.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.840
 Kickboxing in the morning, Jiu Jitsu at night.

23:01.840 --> 23:06.880
 I was just going and going and going and going and I was just thinking just all day long.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.600
 But it fucks with all the other aspects of your life.

23:09.600 --> 23:14.800
 It fucks with your friendships, it fucks with my comedy, it fucks with everything.

23:14.800 --> 23:18.320
 Because that mindset is not a mindset of an artist.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.160
 It's a mindset of a conqueror.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.000
 The conqueror and a destroyer.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.200
 That's why it's so interesting to see Mike Tyson make the switch.

23:25.200 --> 23:30.800
 It's clear that whatever that is, however that fight goes, there's a switch.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.640
 He stepped into a different dimension.

23:32.640 --> 23:40.000
 Roy Jones Jr. is coming on my podcast soon and Roy's going to be on before the fight.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.080
 I'm so curious to see how it goes down, but genuinely concerned.

23:44.720 --> 23:49.200
 Because Mike Tyson is a heavyweight and Roy Jones at his best was 168 pounds.

23:50.720 --> 23:55.840
 I don't know if Roy has that room in his house, mental house of where Mike Tyson goes.

23:55.840 --> 23:56.880
 I don't know.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.320
 I don't know if he has that room.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.360
 Mike doesn't have a room.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.440
 He's got an empire in there.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.960
 He opens up the door.

24:02.960 --> 24:03.920
 He opens up the door.

24:03.920 --> 24:08.240
 There's a whole empire in his head and he's in that firmly.

24:08.240 --> 24:12.160
 You know, when he got out of the weed and started training again,

24:12.160 --> 24:13.680
 like you could see it in him.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.360
 And by the way, physically, in person, he looks spectacular.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.160
 He looks like a fucking Adonis.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.920
 I mean, he looks ready to go.

24:21.920 --> 24:22.960
 It's crazy.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.320
 Yeah, watching videos of him.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.120
 What about you?

24:25.680 --> 24:27.760
 Have you ever considered competing in Jiu Jitsu?

24:28.560 --> 24:30.000
 No, for that very reason.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
 I don't want to get obsessed.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.920
 That's my number one concern.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.200
 I had to quit video games when we were playing video games at the studio.

24:37.200 --> 24:40.320
 I had to quit because I was playing five hours a day out of nowhere.

24:40.320 --> 24:41.680
 All of a sudden, I was playing five hours a day.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.280
 I was coming home late for dinner.

24:43.280 --> 24:47.440
 I was ending podcasts early and jumping on the video games and playing.

24:47.440 --> 24:51.520
 I get obsessed with things and I have to recognize what that is.

24:51.520 --> 24:56.160
 And these competitive things, like competitive, especially like really exciting competitive

24:56.160 --> 24:58.800
 things like video games, they're very dangerous for me.

24:58.800 --> 25:02.160
 The ultimate competitive video game is like Jiu Jitsu.

25:02.160 --> 25:05.200
 And if I was young, I most certainly would have done it.

25:05.200 --> 25:09.520
 If I didn't have a very clear career path, it was something that I enjoyed.

25:09.520 --> 25:13.920
 My concern would be that I would become a professional Jiu Jitsu fighter when I was young.

25:13.920 --> 25:18.320
 And then I would not have the energy to do stand up and do all the other things that I

25:18.320 --> 25:20.480
 wound up doing as a career.

25:20.480 --> 25:25.120
 When I was 21, I quit my job teaching.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.040
 I was teaching at Boston University.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.880
 I was teaching Taekwondo there.

25:28.880 --> 25:33.360
 And I knew, and I also had my own school in Revere.

25:33.360 --> 25:38.320
 I knew I couldn't do it right and also be doing stand up comedy.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.080
 I knew I couldn't do both of those things.

25:40.080 --> 25:40.960
 There was no way.

25:40.960 --> 25:45.680
 You have to be cognizant of that obsessive force within you to make sure.

25:45.680 --> 25:46.320
 Yes.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.560
 I'd have to know how to manage my mental illness.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.440
 That's a very particular mental illness.

25:51.440 --> 25:56.960
 And I think that mental illness, again, my formative years from 15 till I was

25:56.960 --> 26:05.520
 21ish, 22, those years were spent constantly obsessed with martial arts.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.880
 That was my whole day.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.040
 I mean, I trained almost every day.

26:09.040 --> 26:14.160
 The only time I would not train is if I was either injured or if I was exhausted,

26:14.160 --> 26:16.320
 if I needed a day off, but I was obsessed.

26:17.520 --> 26:22.720
 That part of my personality that I haven't nurtured is always going to be there under

26:22.720 --> 26:27.200
 the surface and when it gets reignited by something.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.440
 It's a very weird, it's a weird feeling.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.600
 And it can get reignited with a video game.

26:31.600 --> 26:38.000
 It can get reignited with anything, that obsessive, whatever it is, that competitive demon.

26:38.000 --> 26:38.160
 Yeah.

26:38.160 --> 26:42.000
 The way you talk about guitar, I know you would fall in love with playing guitar,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.240
 but I think you're very wise to not touch that thing.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.120
 That's why I want golf.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.880
 I have friends who want to golf.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.520
 I'm like, I don't fucking want that thing.

26:49.520 --> 26:54.880
 So a lot of people ask me, what's Joe Rogan's Jiu Jitsu game like?

26:57.280 --> 27:00.960
 Assuming that I somehow spend hours rolling with you before and after.

27:02.320 --> 27:06.640
 I mean, what's a good, you should at some point show a technique or something.

27:06.640 --> 27:07.120
 That would be fun.

27:07.120 --> 27:07.360
 Sure.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.480
 I mean, I've got.

27:08.480 --> 27:09.200
 What's your game like?

27:09.200 --> 27:10.240
 What's your technique?

27:10.240 --> 27:15.200
 Oh, I saw you doing a, I think, head and arm something online.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.560
 Yeah, I did.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.920
 That was, I fucked my neck.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.040
 I'm doing head and arm shows.

27:19.040 --> 27:23.920
 I did them so much that I, you know, because you use your neck so much with head and arms

27:23.920 --> 27:29.360
 chokes, I developed like a real kink in my neck and turned out I had a bulging disc.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.120
 And, you know.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.040
 So you do it on that, just one side?

27:33.040 --> 27:37.360
 Well, it was, no, I could do it on the left side, but I definitely am better on the right side.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.280
 The right side was my best side.

27:39.280 --> 27:42.400
 So if you were to compete, let's say, like, what's your A game?

27:42.400 --> 27:44.880
 What would you go from standing up?

27:44.880 --> 27:46.480
 How would you go to submission?

27:46.480 --> 27:47.440
 Would you pull guard?

27:47.440 --> 27:49.040
 Would you take down?

27:49.040 --> 27:51.040
 Well, how would you pass guard?

27:51.040 --> 27:51.520
 What's your?

27:51.520 --> 27:52.800
 I don't have good takedowns.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.160
 I was not a good wrestler.

27:54.160 --> 27:59.040
 So I would most likely either pull guard or I would pull half guard.

27:59.040 --> 27:59.920
 Do you have a good guard?

27:59.920 --> 28:00.400
 Yes.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.800
 Are you comfortable being on your butt and your back?

28:02.800 --> 28:04.640
 Yes, I'm very flexible.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.880
 So I have good, my rubber guard is pretty good.

28:06.880 --> 28:07.760
 You go to rubber guard.

28:07.760 --> 28:08.160
 Yeah.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.480
 You have good arm bars and good triangles off my back.

28:10.480 --> 28:15.920
 But I also have a very good half guard, but my top game is my best.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.320
 I have a very strong top game.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.360
 Do you have a half guard?

28:19.360 --> 28:21.840
 Do you have a preference of what kind of guard

28:21.840 --> 28:23.360
 and how to pass that guard?

28:23.360 --> 28:28.480
 And like, yeah, like, is there a specific game plan?

28:28.480 --> 28:30.880
 Like, would you double under hooks from half guard

28:30.880 --> 28:32.640
 is the game plan for me?

28:32.640 --> 28:34.560
 If I can get double under hooks from half guard,

28:34.560 --> 28:36.160
 I could sweep a lot of people.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.840
 Under hooks of what?

28:37.840 --> 28:38.960
 Sorry, the arms or the legs?

28:38.960 --> 28:40.960
 So half guard, lockdown, right?

28:40.960 --> 28:40.960
 Lockdown, got it.

28:40.960 --> 28:44.000
 Half guard, go into lockdown, double under hooks.

28:44.000 --> 28:44.400
 Got it.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.360
 Clench to the body.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.480
 Suck the body in tight.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.040
 Pressure.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.720
 And yeah, massive pressure.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.520
 And then inch my way into a position.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.640
 We call the dog fight.

28:52.640 --> 28:56.480
 And inch my way to a position where I could get the person on their back.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.320
 Yeah, that's what, because you did show me,

28:58.320 --> 29:00.320
 I still disagree with you about the tie thing.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.200
 That you can choke something with it.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.960
 So wrong, so wrong.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.320
 Well, it's not wrong with you.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.080
 With you, it's wrong because you.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.200
 No, I think there's a system.

29:10.640 --> 29:11.760
 I have this thing with Donna here.

29:11.760 --> 29:12.880
 We're going to figure it out.

29:12.880 --> 29:13.440
 Okay.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.920
 Let's have a little velcro on the back.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.000
 No, let's see, that's, you're just not the king.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.680
 You're not, you're the exact, that's cheating.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.160
 Yeah, you did, I did feel when you showed me,

29:24.160 --> 29:25.760
 I think you showed me the rubber guard,

29:25.760 --> 29:28.080
 because it's still a guard that's a little bit foreign to me.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.800
 I just felt that you can immediately feel,

29:30.800 --> 29:32.000
 not with the rubber guard, just,

29:32.000 --> 29:37.760
 but the way you move your body is you're like a Shonji type of guy

29:37.760 --> 29:40.400
 who knows how to control another human being.

29:40.400 --> 29:44.320
 So like some people are a little bit more, I would say agile

29:44.320 --> 29:46.960
 and technically like playful and kind of.

29:46.960 --> 29:47.920
 Loose.

29:47.920 --> 29:51.600
 Loose and they work on transition, transition, transition.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.800
 You're a control guy.

29:52.800 --> 29:56.080
 Like you know how to control position and advance position.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.120
 Donna is the same way.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.320
 He's all about control.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.520
 My, my game is smush.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.040
 That's my game.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.040
 Smush you, grab ahold of you.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.800
 Once I have you, why would I let you go?

30:04.800 --> 30:06.720
 That's my thought is like, why would I let you go?

30:06.720 --> 30:09.520
 I just want to incrementally move to a better position

30:09.520 --> 30:10.640
 until I can strangle you.

30:11.280 --> 30:15.200
 But I'm much more into strangling people than anything else.

30:15.200 --> 30:20.560
 Yeah, which is a great MMA approach for Jiu Jitsu.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.280
 Well, too many people don't tap when you get their arms.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.320
 You know, and it's not, I'm not opposed to arm bars.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.520
 I love arm bars, but everybody goes to sleep.

30:29.520 --> 30:29.840
 Yep.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.040
 And, and quit from pressure too.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.560
 I mean, quit mentally.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.200
 Yeah, you can't breathe.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.080
 You know, if you got a guy who's like a really good top game guy

30:40.080 --> 30:42.720
 and he mounts you and I'm a big fan of mounting

30:42.720 --> 30:45.680
 with my legs crossed, you know, like a guard,

30:45.680 --> 30:46.720
 like a top guard.

30:47.280 --> 30:51.600
 And so I can squeeze with both legs and smush.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.800
 And I'm just, I'm just looking for people to make mistakes

30:54.800 --> 30:57.680
 and slowly incrementally bettering my position

30:57.680 --> 30:59.280
 until I can get something locked up.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.120
 I love Jiu Jitsu though, man.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.720
 I just wish it didn't injure you.

31:02.720 --> 31:02.960
 Yeah.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.560
 You know, Jiu Jitsu is like,

31:04.560 --> 31:06.320
 if your joints were more durable,

31:06.320 --> 31:08.560
 they could figure out a way to make joints more durable.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.000
 God, Jiu Jitsu forever.

31:10.560 --> 31:10.560
 Yeah.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.280
 So much fun.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.360
 Actually, I talked to this roboticist, Russ Tedrick.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.680
 He builds one of the world class people

31:17.680 --> 31:19.040
 that builds human robots.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.480
 You're interested in Boston Dynamics.

31:20.480 --> 31:20.720
 Yeah.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.200
 He's one of the key people in that kind of robotics.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.440
 So I asked him the stupidest question of like,

31:25.440 --> 31:29.760
 how far are we from having a robot be a UFC champion?

31:31.360 --> 31:34.240
 And yeah, it's actually a really, really tough problem.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.440
 It's the same thing that, you know,

31:37.440 --> 31:38.800
 makes somebody like Danielle Comey,

31:38.800 --> 31:40.960
 like on the wrestling side, special,

31:40.960 --> 31:43.600
 because you have to understand the movement of the human body

31:43.600 --> 31:45.840
 in ways that's so difficult to teach.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.800
 It's so subtle, the timing, the pressure points,

31:48.800 --> 31:50.560
 like the leverage, all those kinds of things.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.800
 That's just for the clinch situation.

31:52.800 --> 31:56.720
 And then the movement for the striking is very difficult.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.720
 As long as you're not allowed as a robot

31:58.720 --> 32:01.040
 to like use your natural abilities

32:01.040 --> 32:03.440
 of having a lot more power.

32:03.440 --> 32:06.480
 Right. A lot more power and then more durable.

32:06.480 --> 32:06.880
 Right.

32:06.880 --> 32:09.600
 The human body, like especially meniscus,

32:09.600 --> 32:11.920
 like you see the heel hook game,

32:11.920 --> 32:14.160
 like everybody's involved in leg locks and heel hooks,

32:14.160 --> 32:18.080
 like all those guys wind up with torched knees.

32:18.080 --> 32:19.440
 Everyone's got torched knees.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.440
 Everyone's knees are torn apart.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.200
 And you don't grow new meniscus.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.760
 You know, that's like one of those joints where, man,

32:25.760 --> 32:28.240
 when it goes, it's like, you know,

32:28.240 --> 32:30.720
 those guys are 28 years old have blown out knees.

32:31.520 --> 32:32.880
 Let me ask the ridiculous question.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.480
 What do you think, we're talking about cops.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.800
 So what do you think is the best martial arts,

32:36.800 --> 32:37.520
 self defense?

32:38.240 --> 32:39.360
 For sure, Jiu Jitsu.

32:39.360 --> 32:39.920
 Yeah, for sure.

32:39.920 --> 32:40.320
 Wrestling?

32:41.040 --> 32:42.880
 I think grappling, I should say.

32:43.440 --> 32:46.080
 What judo as well, especially, you know, cold climate,

32:46.080 --> 32:48.640
 if you get someone who's got like a heavy winter jacket on,

32:48.640 --> 32:50.560
 my God, like judo is an incredible martial art.

32:50.560 --> 32:51.200
 Plus concrete.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.920
 That's the worst place to be with a heavy winter jacket

32:55.920 --> 32:58.720
 with a judo specialist and you're standing up with them.

32:58.720 --> 32:59.360
 Oh my God.

32:59.360 --> 33:02.960
 But I think grappling, because in most self defense situations,

33:02.960 --> 33:04.960
 it usually winds up with grappling.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.920
 You're definitely better off though, knowing some striking,

33:07.920 --> 33:09.920
 because there's nothing more terrifying than when you go

33:09.920 --> 33:12.320
 to take someone down, they actually have takedown skills,

33:12.320 --> 33:13.360
 but they can fight.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.560
 And so they have takedown defense and they know how to fight,

33:16.560 --> 33:18.000
 and then you don't know how to stand up.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.400
 Like the worst thing in the world is seeing someone like

33:20.400 --> 33:22.960
 reaching who doesn't know how to do striking

33:22.960 --> 33:24.240
 and someone cracks you.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.280
 What about all that Krav Magat talk, which is like,

33:27.280 --> 33:29.440
 you know, the whole line of argument that says that

33:29.440 --> 33:31.760
 Jiu Jitsu and wrestling and all of these sports,

33:31.760 --> 33:35.200
 they fundamentally take you away from the nature of violence.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.280
 So they're just teaching you how to play

33:38.400 --> 33:44.240
 versus the reality of violence that is involved

33:44.240 --> 33:46.240
 in like a self defense situation

33:46.240 --> 33:50.400
 that is a totally different set of skills would be needed.

33:50.400 --> 33:54.000
 In general, the people that say that Jiu Jitsu

33:54.000 --> 33:58.320
 or other martial arts don't, it's more of a sport,

33:58.320 --> 34:02.480
 and they don't really understand violence.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.720
 In general, the people that say that suck.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.720
 Yeah, that's...

34:06.720 --> 34:09.120
 Anybody who thinks like someone's like,

34:09.120 --> 34:10.480
 you know, hey man, I'll just bite you.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.920
 I'm like, are you going to bite me?

34:11.920 --> 34:12.960
 Okay.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.480
 Do you think I'm going to bite you too?

34:14.480 --> 34:15.520
 What do you think of that?

34:15.520 --> 34:17.120
 What if I punch you in your fucking face?

34:17.120 --> 34:18.480
 You think you're still going to bite me

34:18.480 --> 34:19.680
 when you can't even see?

34:19.680 --> 34:22.640
 When you barely even know you're alive?

34:22.640 --> 34:24.240
 And I choke you unconscious?

34:24.240 --> 34:26.080
 If someone's really good at Jiu Jitsu,

34:26.080 --> 34:28.320
 good luck stabbing them with your keys.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.920
 You know, you don't have a chance.

34:29.920 --> 34:30.640
 You don't have a chance.

34:30.640 --> 34:31.680
 If someone's much better at you

34:31.680 --> 34:34.080
 and they trip you and get you on your back

34:34.080 --> 34:36.240
 and then they fucking elbow you in your face

34:36.240 --> 34:38.080
 and then get a head and arm choke on you,

34:38.080 --> 34:40.320
 all that crap, my gosh, it's out the window, son.

34:40.320 --> 34:45.760
 You're way better off learning what works on trained killers.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
 Like this whole idea that you're going to poke some in the eye

34:47.760 --> 34:49.120
 and then you're going to kick them in the nuts.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.360
 And you're going through these drills

34:51.360 --> 34:53.360
 that, yeah, it's good to know what to do

34:53.360 --> 34:55.760
 if you run into someone who doesn't know how to fight.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.160
 It's way better to know what to do

34:58.160 --> 35:00.080
 to someone who knows how to fight.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.760
 That's the best thing.

35:01.760 --> 35:05.280
 Learn how to fight against people who know how to fight.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.920
 Like all that practice self defense

35:07.920 --> 35:09.600
 and they go, I'm just going to come at you with a knife.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.120
 You're going to grab the wrist and do that.

35:11.120 --> 35:14.560
 Like it's good to know self defense.

35:14.560 --> 35:18.560
 But it's much more important to understand martial arts.

35:18.560 --> 35:19.680
 Comprehensive.

35:19.680 --> 35:22.480
 When you understand martial arts, comprehensively.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.960
 Like there's no, I shouldn't say there's no CROVMA guy guys,

35:24.960 --> 35:29.360
 but it would be shocking if a CROVMA guy guy

35:29.360 --> 35:31.760
 and a mixed martial arts guy had a fight,

35:31.760 --> 35:34.960
 and the mixed martial arts guy was a trained killer all around,

35:34.960 --> 35:36.960
 didn't fuck that guy up.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.360
 That's what I would expect would happen.

35:39.360 --> 35:44.160
 I would not think that some guy who has a little bit of this

35:44.160 --> 35:47.360
 and a little bit of that and prepares for the streets

35:47.360 --> 35:50.560
 is going to be able to handle a person who trains with killers

35:50.560 --> 35:53.760
 on a day to day basis, who rolls with Jiu Jitsu black belts,

35:53.760 --> 35:55.760
 who trains with Muay Thai champions.

35:55.760 --> 35:59.280
 Like the best martial arts are the martial arts

35:59.280 --> 36:01.200
 that work on martial artists,

36:01.200 --> 36:03.920
 not the martial arts that work on untrained people.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.720
 What about we're in Texas now, what about guns?

36:06.720 --> 36:08.160
 Well, that's the best martial art.

36:08.160 --> 36:12.320
 No, but would you, like in this crazy time,

36:12.320 --> 36:14.560
 should people carry guns?

36:14.560 --> 36:17.360
 It's not a bad idea to have a gun,

36:17.360 --> 36:20.160
 because if you need a gun, you have a gun.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.920
 And if you don't need a gun,

36:21.920 --> 36:24.720
 if you're a person with self control, you're not going to use it.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.720
 You're not going to just randomly use it,

36:26.720 --> 36:28.400
 but you have something to protect you.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.160
 This is the whole idea of the Second Amendment.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.760
 The whole idea of the Second Amendment gets distorted

36:31.760 --> 36:34.960
 by mass shootings or by terrible people who murder people

36:34.960 --> 36:38.800
 and do terrible things, but all those things are real,

36:38.800 --> 36:42.800
 but they don't take away from the fundamental,

36:42.800 --> 36:47.600
 the fundamental efficacy of having a firearm

36:47.600 --> 36:50.560
 and defending your family or defending your life.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.040
 And there are real live situations

36:53.040 --> 36:57.040
 where people have had firearms and it's protected them

36:57.040 --> 36:59.680
 or their loved ones or they've stopped shooters.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.440
 There's many of these stories,

37:01.440 --> 37:02.640
 but people don't like those stories,

37:02.640 --> 37:06.560
 because then it tends to lead to this gun culture argument,

37:06.560 --> 37:08.320
 this pro gun culture argument,

37:08.320 --> 37:10.320
 that people find very uncomfortable.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.880
 It's, human beings are messy,

37:12.880 --> 37:15.120
 and we're messy in so many different ways, right?

37:15.120 --> 37:18.800
 We're messy emotionally, we're messy physically,

37:18.800 --> 37:21.920
 but we're also messy in what's good or bad.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.600
 We want things to be binary.

37:23.600 --> 37:27.120
 We want things to be right or wrong, one or zero.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.120
 And they're not, but there is crime in the world.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.640
 And there is violence in the world,

37:32.640 --> 37:34.880
 and you're better off knowing how to fight

37:34.880 --> 37:37.600
 and you're better off knowing how to defend yourself

37:37.600 --> 37:39.440
 and you're better off having a gun.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.760
 And I generally think that guns,

37:41.760 --> 37:44.400
 I do like the idea that guns,

37:44.400 --> 37:46.400
 Second Amendment helps protect the First Amendment.

37:46.400 --> 37:50.160
 There is a kind of sense that puts me at ease

37:50.160 --> 37:52.800
 knowing that so many people in this country have guns,

37:53.440 --> 37:55.360
 that, I mean, Alex Jones,

37:55.360 --> 37:59.040
 I just listened to one episode of Info Wars for the first time.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.440
 Boy, he reminds me like when I drank some tequila,

38:03.440 --> 38:06.320
 I felt like I'm going to some dark places today.

38:06.320 --> 38:08.480
 That's how I feel like listening to him.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.520
 But he talks about like that it's,

38:12.160 --> 38:13.680
 he worries about martial law.

38:14.480 --> 38:16.880
 So basically government overreach by,

38:16.880 --> 38:18.640
 which happened throughout history.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.520
 Like there's, there's something to worry about there.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.680
 But it's, it puts me at ease knowing

38:23.680 --> 38:26.560
 that so much of the population has guns

38:26.560 --> 38:28.480
 that people government would think twice

38:29.120 --> 38:32.160
 before instituting martial law on cities.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.680
 But I actually was asking almost like on the individual level.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.920
 I maybe shouldn't say this,

38:37.920 --> 38:39.600
 but I don't yet own a gun.

38:40.480 --> 38:44.880
 And I felt that if I carry a gun statistically,

38:44.880 --> 38:47.200
 just for me as a human knowing my psychology,

38:47.200 --> 38:49.040
 I feel like I'm more likely to die.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.520
 Like I feel like I would put myself in situations

38:53.520 --> 38:54.080
 that I shouldn't.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.640
 Like the way I, I will see the world will change.

38:57.600 --> 39:01.120
 Because my natural feeling is like when somebody,

39:01.120 --> 39:02.480
 when I was in Philly,

39:02.480 --> 39:05.120
 and I knew late at night if West Philly,

39:05.120 --> 39:07.360
 when some guy looks at you,

39:08.400 --> 39:09.840
 and you can immediately calculate

39:09.840 --> 39:12.480
 that there's this dangerous human being there,

39:12.480 --> 39:14.560
 it starts with a monkey look at first.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.560
 Like I'm a bigger monkey than you.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.200
 And that's where I found like, for example,

39:19.200 --> 39:21.040
 I'll do the beta thing of just looking down

39:21.040 --> 39:23.120
 and turning away and just getting out of trouble,

39:23.120 --> 39:24.320
 like very politely.

39:25.120 --> 39:27.200
 And basically that kind of approach,

39:28.240 --> 39:30.080
 because if you have a,

39:30.080 --> 39:32.720
 in terms of getting out of serious violent situations,

39:32.720 --> 39:36.080
 like serious, something where you could die, versus

39:36.800 --> 39:38.880
 if I had a gun, I feel like I would want to be,

39:40.320 --> 39:42.960
 that that would be that cowboy monkey thing

39:42.960 --> 39:45.520
 where I would want to put myself in situations

39:45.520 --> 39:47.920
 where I'm a little bit of a savior, even of myself,

39:48.720 --> 39:53.040
 and almost create danger which can no longer,

39:53.040 --> 39:56.960
 like the escalation of which I can no longer control.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.120
 Well, you're talking about taking a gun somewhere

39:59.120 --> 40:00.560
 versus having a gun in your home.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.080
 Yes, yes. I mean carry on me.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.320
 That's a different situation and much harder

40:04.320 --> 40:06.800
 to get a warrant or a license for that.

40:07.760 --> 40:11.440
 Control concealed carry licenses, especially in Massachusetts.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.160
 They don't come easy.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.920
 A little message. Yeah, that's a whole other thing.

40:13.920 --> 40:14.320
 Yeah.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.760
 But you're saying gun in the home.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.360
 Yeah, gun in the home.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.760
 Having a gun, knowing how to use a gun.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.960
 Like I know how to use a gun.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.280
 I've trained many hours

40:23.840 --> 40:26.240
 learning how to shoot a gun at tactical places.

40:27.040 --> 40:30.000
 There's a bunch of videos of me doing it on Instagram.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.280
 That's interesting.

40:31.280 --> 40:34.320
 I practice and I think it's good to understand

40:34.320 --> 40:35.360
 to how to be accurate.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
 So I've been a fan of your podcast for a long time.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.080
 You don't often talk about it

40:40.640 --> 40:42.160
 because you're always kind of looking forward.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.960
 But if you look at the old studio that you just left,

40:45.600 --> 40:48.880
 is there some epic memories that stand out to you

40:48.880 --> 40:51.840
 that you almost look back?

40:51.840 --> 40:52.960
 I can't believe this happened.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.000
 Oh yeah, almost too many of them to count.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.240
 Is there something that pops into mind now?

40:58.240 --> 41:01.200
 All of them, Elon Musk blowing that flame thrower

41:01.200 --> 41:02.160
 in the middle of the hallway.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.160
 I got a video of that.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.280
 Have you ever seen the video of it?

41:05.280 --> 41:06.800
 Yeah, I think you post that on Instagram.

41:06.800 --> 41:07.920
 I think I did too.

41:07.920 --> 41:08.800
 Yeah, he's a madman.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.120
 Having Bernie Sanders in there.

41:12.480 --> 41:16.000
 Just all the fun fight companions we did

41:16.000 --> 41:18.640
 and all the crazy podcasts with Joey Diaz

41:18.640 --> 41:19.600
 and Duncan Trussell.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.320
 There were so many, there were so many moments.

41:22.320 --> 41:27.600
 It's podcasts, this is a weird art form

41:27.600 --> 41:30.720
 and it almost seems like, it sounds silly,

41:30.720 --> 41:32.640
 but it almost seems like something that chose me

41:32.640 --> 41:33.760
 rather than I chose it.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.800
 I think of that all the time in some strange way.

41:36.800 --> 41:40.240
 It's like I'm showing up as like an antenna

41:40.240 --> 41:43.120
 and I just plug in and twist on

41:43.120 --> 41:46.640
 and then I take in the thing and I put it together

41:46.640 --> 41:49.680
 and I'm like a passenger of this weird ride.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.520
 Yeah, you talked about this before.

41:51.520 --> 41:55.680
 I really like this idea of that human beings

41:55.680 --> 41:57.200
 are just carriers of these ideas.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.600
 Ideas are the ones who are breeding.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.840
 So in a sense like the idea found you

42:01.840 --> 42:04.640
 as a useful brain to use to spread itself

42:04.640 --> 42:06.000
 through the podcasting medium.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.560
 But because when I think about your podcast,

42:12.560 --> 42:13.680
 I think about Joey Diaz.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.080
 I think about all those comedians you've had.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.840
 I mean, I think you've had Joey on,

42:18.400 --> 42:21.200
 I mean, maybe close to 50 times 60.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.800
 Some crazy number.

42:22.800 --> 42:27.120
 Is there, I mean, he is over the top offensive.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.600
 Just that's who he is to the core.

42:30.720 --> 42:34.400
 Is there some sense where you,

42:36.080 --> 42:39.600
 you wondered like whether it's right to have

42:40.400 --> 42:42.880
 the Spotify episode number one with Duncan Dressel

42:43.840 --> 42:44.640
 for five hours.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.120
 No, I wanted to do it that way.

42:47.120 --> 42:50.800
 That's why we wore NASA suits and we got high as fuck.

42:50.800 --> 42:53.040
 It's like, that's the whole idea behind it.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.720
 I mean, can you introspect that a little bit?

42:54.720 --> 42:56.000
 Like, what is that?

42:56.000 --> 42:57.120
 Because that's rare.

42:57.120 --> 43:03.040
 It's such a rare thing to do because you're not supposed to

43:03.680 --> 43:06.640
 talk to Duncan Dressel with a huge platform

43:06.640 --> 43:08.240
 that you have five hours.

43:08.240 --> 43:08.720
 Why not?

43:09.440 --> 43:12.720
 Because Donald Trump apparently watches your podcast.

43:14.640 --> 43:16.480
 So just the idea that there's these,

43:16.480 --> 43:19.440
 I mean, that's what I think about these CEOs, right?

43:19.440 --> 43:23.200
 To me that they listen to the podcast that I do.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.440
 And I have somebody like a David Fravor

43:26.240 --> 43:27.680
 and I was nervous about it.

43:27.680 --> 43:29.280
 I was nervous to have a conversation.

43:29.280 --> 43:33.040
 For me, David Fravor is a Duncan Dressel, which is like.

43:33.040 --> 43:36.320
 Just because of his experiences with UFOs.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.960
 Yeah, just even just the way he sees the world

43:38.960 --> 43:40.240
 because he is open.

43:40.240 --> 43:41.200
 I don't know if he's always like this,

43:41.200 --> 43:43.520
 but he opened himself to the possibility

43:43.520 --> 43:45.920
 of unconventional ideas.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.640
 Most people in the scientific community kind of say,

43:48.640 --> 43:50.240
 well, I don't really want to believe anything

43:50.240 --> 43:52.160
 that doesn't have a lot of hard evidence.

43:52.160 --> 43:52.880
 Right.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.880
 And so that was to me like a step.

43:54.880 --> 43:58.240
 And as the thing somehow becomes more popular,

43:58.240 --> 44:01.200
 there becomes this fear of like, well,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.080
 should I talk to this person or not?

44:04.080 --> 44:06.880
 And I mean, you're an inspiration in saying like,

44:06.880 --> 44:08.080
 do whatever the hell you want.

44:08.080 --> 44:08.800
 You have to.

44:09.520 --> 44:13.280
 Well, first of all, I have what you call fuck you money.

44:13.920 --> 44:16.080
 And if you have fuck you money, you don't say fuck you.

44:16.080 --> 44:18.000
 What's the point of having the fuck you money?

44:18.000 --> 44:19.360
 You're wasting it.

44:19.360 --> 44:20.880
 Like you're wasting the position.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.560
 Like someone said to me like,

44:22.560 --> 44:24.320
 why do you like sports cars so much?

44:24.320 --> 44:26.160
 Like how many cars do you have a bunch of cars?

44:26.160 --> 44:28.560
 So because if I was a kid and I said,

44:28.560 --> 44:31.120
 hey, if I was that crazy rich famous guy,

44:31.120 --> 44:33.760
 like I don't want to have a bunch of cool fucking cars.

44:33.760 --> 44:36.000
 Like so I would do that.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.800
 Like because not everybody gets to do that.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.720
 Like if you're the person that gets to do that,

44:40.720 --> 44:42.400
 you're kind of supposed to do it.

44:42.400 --> 44:46.160
 Like that's if you want to, if that really does speak to you

44:46.160 --> 44:49.440
 and you know, I've talked to you about this before.

44:49.440 --> 44:54.400
 Muscle cars, specifically once for the 1960s and the early 70s,

44:54.400 --> 44:56.480
 they speak to me in some weird way, man.

44:56.480 --> 44:57.680
 I could just stare at them.

44:57.680 --> 44:59.360
 Like I have a 65 Corvette.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.840
 I walk around it sometimes at night when no one's around.

45:01.840 --> 45:02.320
 65 Corvette.

45:02.320 --> 45:05.360
 What's your favorite muscle car?

45:05.360 --> 45:09.520
 Like what's your most badass late 60s, the personal car?

45:09.520 --> 45:11.040
 Probably that car, probably that 65 Corvette.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.480
 65 Corvette.

45:12.480 --> 45:15.200
 Yeah, I walk around it when no one's around.

45:15.200 --> 45:16.880
 I think I've driven the 69 Corvette.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.520
 Is there a particular year that just...

45:19.520 --> 45:22.160
 65 is generation two.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.920
 69 is generation three.

45:23.920 --> 45:26.720
 69 is like the, it's even more curvy.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.440
 They're both awesome, just awesome in different ways.

45:29.440 --> 45:33.120
 But I just love muscle cars for whatever reason.

45:33.120 --> 45:36.000
 But the point is like, I like what I like.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.200
 And if I can do what I want to do, I should do what I want to do.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.880
 And it's not hurting anybody.

45:40.880 --> 45:43.760
 And the thing is like, I would do the Duncan podcast

45:43.760 --> 45:45.360
 if no one was listening, right?

45:45.360 --> 45:48.160
 If we were just starting to do a podcast together

45:48.160 --> 45:50.720
 and no one cared and it got like 2000 views,

45:50.720 --> 45:52.480
 which we did for years.

45:52.480 --> 45:53.200
 Yeah, for a long time.

45:53.200 --> 45:54.720
 I would do it with Duncan and we would get high

45:54.720 --> 45:57.440
 and we'd talk crazy shit about aliens, the spaceships,

45:57.440 --> 46:00.800
 and maybe dude, maybe ideas are living life forms

46:00.800 --> 46:02.720
 and they're inside your head and that's how things get...

46:02.720 --> 46:03.040
 Man.

46:03.040 --> 46:04.320
 Yeah, man.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.920
 I've just kind of morphed me and him together and that

46:07.920 --> 46:11.440
 because the life form, idea life form idea is mine.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.920
 That I've really, I really think about a lot.

46:13.920 --> 46:15.760
 I think about on a technical side, by the way.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.800
 When I heard you say that, because I've been thinking,

46:18.800 --> 46:21.120
 I was like, whoa, that's interesting.

46:21.120 --> 46:23.600
 It might be, they might be alive

46:23.600 --> 46:25.600
 because I don't know what the fuck they are.

46:25.600 --> 46:28.880
 But when someone has an idea for whatever,

46:28.880 --> 46:32.240
 an invention, a toaster, and then they think about this,

46:32.240 --> 46:35.280
 all they need is like these heating elements in the spring

46:35.280 --> 46:36.400
 and then it pops when it's done.

46:36.400 --> 46:39.120
 So I have a timer and then they build this thing.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.560
 Now all of a sudden it's alive.

46:40.560 --> 46:43.280
 It's like you manifested it in a physical form.

46:43.280 --> 46:47.280
 A toaster is not the best example, but a car, an airplane.

46:47.280 --> 46:51.280
 You're thinking about a thing, like an idea comes into your head

46:51.280 --> 46:53.200
 and you can say, oh, well, it's just creativity.

46:53.200 --> 46:54.160
 It's a part of being a person.

46:54.160 --> 46:58.480
 That's how we invented tools and how we became better hunters.

46:58.480 --> 46:59.600
 All those things are true.

46:59.600 --> 47:04.240
 I'm not saying that there's some magic to what I'm saying,

47:04.240 --> 47:09.440
 but there's also a possibility that we're simplifying something

47:09.440 --> 47:11.440
 by saying that it's just creativity,

47:11.440 --> 47:14.480
 that it's just a natural human inclination to invent things.

47:15.600 --> 47:20.640
 Why is it possible that ideas, like creativity,

47:20.640 --> 47:24.560
 like we are the only animal other than there's a few species

47:24.560 --> 47:27.280
 that create things like bees, make beehives,

47:27.280 --> 47:29.200
 but they're very uniform.

47:30.480 --> 47:34.400
 Some animals use tools, chimps will use sticks

47:34.400 --> 47:36.320
 to get termites and things like that,

47:36.320 --> 47:41.680
 but there's something about what we do that makes you wonder,

47:41.680 --> 47:44.480
 because we look at this, just look at this room that we're in.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.160
 Look at all these electronics.

47:46.160 --> 47:50.160
 Look at all this crazy shit that human beings have invented

47:50.160 --> 47:53.760
 and then built upon others inventions, improved and innovated.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.240
 These all came out of ideas.

47:57.840 --> 48:02.080
 The idea, it germinates in someone's head.

48:02.080 --> 48:03.040
 It bounces around.

48:03.040 --> 48:04.000
 They write it down.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.360
 They share it with others.

48:05.360 --> 48:07.280
 The other people who have similar ideas

48:07.280 --> 48:09.920
 or ideas that are complementary, they work together

48:09.920 --> 48:12.400
 and they change the world.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.960
 The new thing in that is the idea is not the people.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.880
 It's like we think we found the ideas,

48:16.880 --> 48:19.440
 but it's more like the ideas found us.

48:19.440 --> 48:22.320
 Find you, yeah, they're literally in the air.

48:23.520 --> 48:24.160
 They come to you.

48:24.160 --> 48:25.840
 I always felt like that with bits.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.040
 Like when I come up with a bit,

48:27.760 --> 48:29.680
 that's why I'm always telling people

48:29.680 --> 48:32.560
 about the Stephen Pressfield book, The War of Art,

48:32.560 --> 48:35.360
 because he talks about respecting the muse

48:35.360 --> 48:39.920
 and the idea that your ideas come when you sit down

48:39.920 --> 48:42.320
 and you do the work or you sit down like a professional

48:42.320 --> 48:45.600
 and you talk to the muse, tell me what to do.

48:45.600 --> 48:47.600
 Like if the muse was a real thing,

48:47.600 --> 48:50.800
 as if the muse was like some mystical creature

48:50.800 --> 48:52.640
 that comes and delivers you ideas,

48:53.520 --> 48:56.000
 even if that's not real, that's how it works.

48:56.640 --> 48:57.760
 It does work like that.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.000
 If you do treat it like it's a muse

49:00.000 --> 49:01.520
 and you treat it with the respect

49:01.520 --> 49:03.600
 and you treat it like a professional,

49:03.600 --> 49:04.880
 the ideas do come to you.

49:04.880 --> 49:06.240
 I never thought about what he's doing

49:06.240 --> 49:08.720
 is just sitting there waiting for the idea

49:08.720 --> 49:10.640
 that's trying to breed to find him.

49:11.600 --> 49:13.200
 That's a trippy thing.

49:13.200 --> 49:16.480
 If you show up and put in the time

49:16.480 --> 49:18.960
 and focus your energy on that,

49:18.960 --> 49:21.360
 the ideas, they will arrive.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.280
 They will arrive.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.280
 And that's the same with writing comedy.

49:25.280 --> 49:26.720
 I've just been many, many times

49:26.720 --> 49:28.480
 where I'll come home from the comedy store

49:28.480 --> 49:30.240
 and I just sit down and I start writing

49:30.240 --> 49:31.920
 and I just, I've got nothing.

49:31.920 --> 49:32.640
 There's nothing there.

49:32.640 --> 49:33.520
 I'm just writing.

49:33.520 --> 49:34.880
 It's all bullshit.

49:34.880 --> 49:35.920
 It's nothing's good.

49:35.920 --> 49:37.280
 It's just like, hmm.

49:37.280 --> 49:40.320
 And then all of a sudden, bam, there's the idea.

49:41.840 --> 49:43.280
 And then all of a sudden, I can't stop.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.040
 And then, you know, it was a couple hours later

49:45.040 --> 49:46.080
 and I'm like, whoa.

49:46.080 --> 49:47.520
 And then the next night I'm on stage

49:47.520 --> 49:49.040
 and I'm like, how about that?

49:49.600 --> 49:51.040
 Boom, it gets this big laugh.

49:51.040 --> 49:52.640
 I'm like, holy shit.

49:52.640 --> 49:55.280
 And I know that came out of the discipline

49:55.280 --> 49:56.880
 to sit down and call the muse.

49:56.880 --> 50:01.120
 I mean, the cool thing is the ideas have found you to like,

50:01.120 --> 50:02.960
 oh, I'm going to use this dude.

50:02.960 --> 50:05.600
 Like, he seems to have a podcast that's popular.

50:05.600 --> 50:07.760
 I'm going to breathe inside his brain

50:07.760 --> 50:09.440
 and spread it to others.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.640
 It's the same as...

50:10.640 --> 50:12.000
 Or an inventor.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.280
 You know, I'm going to use this guy

50:13.280 --> 50:16.160
 who's like desperately seeking some sort of a product

50:16.160 --> 50:17.040
 to bring to market.

50:17.040 --> 50:18.400
 Some guy who wants to invent things,

50:18.400 --> 50:20.240
 just thinking about inventing things all the time.

50:20.240 --> 50:23.200
 Like these ideas, the wheeze of their way into your head.

50:23.200 --> 50:26.400
 And it seems to me also that you'll have

50:26.400 --> 50:30.960
 the frequency that your mind operates under

50:30.960 --> 50:32.080
 has to be correct.

50:32.720 --> 50:34.800
 Because one of the things about creativity seems to be

50:34.800 --> 50:36.800
 if you think about yourself a lot,

50:36.800 --> 50:40.080
 if you're really into yourself or your image

50:40.080 --> 50:43.920
 or you're selfish, those ideas are not...

50:43.920 --> 50:45.040
 They don't find you.

50:45.040 --> 50:46.080
 Yeah, it's funny.

50:46.080 --> 50:48.160
 It stifles the creative...

50:48.160 --> 50:50.480
 Yeah, it stifles the opportunity

50:50.480 --> 50:52.240
 that the idea has for defining.

50:52.240 --> 50:52.880
 Yes.

50:52.880 --> 50:54.880
 Which is one of the reasons why joke thieves,

50:54.880 --> 50:57.360
 people that steal jokes are terrible writers.

50:57.360 --> 51:00.320
 There's never really good writers who are also joke thieves.

51:00.320 --> 51:01.600
 It's just joke thieves.

51:02.240 --> 51:04.800
 And then when they have to write on their own,

51:04.800 --> 51:07.920
 if they get exposed, they become terrible comedians.

51:07.920 --> 51:11.040
 They're a shadow of what they were

51:11.040 --> 51:12.800
 when they were stealing other people's ideas.

51:12.800 --> 51:16.320
 Because the thing that would make you steal a person's idea

51:16.320 --> 51:17.760
 is that ego part.

51:17.760 --> 51:20.160
 The wanting to claim it for yourself,

51:20.160 --> 51:23.040
 the wanting to be the man or the woman.

51:23.040 --> 51:25.360
 You want to be the person who gets out there that says it

51:25.360 --> 51:27.360
 and everybody's going to love me for it.

51:27.360 --> 51:30.720
 Like, you can't think like that and be creative.

51:30.720 --> 51:33.040
 It requires a humility

51:33.040 --> 51:36.640
 and it requires a detachment from self in order to create.

51:36.640 --> 51:39.200
 Like, when I'm writing, I'm blank.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.640
 I'm like, I'm just staring.

51:40.640 --> 51:41.840
 I'm like, I'm just...

51:41.840 --> 51:45.840
 The part of my mind that's active is not like me.

51:45.840 --> 51:48.640
 It's like this weird core function part

51:48.640 --> 51:53.040
 where I'm not aware of my personality.

51:53.040 --> 51:55.440
 I'm not aware of any of that.

51:55.440 --> 51:59.440
 I'm just trying to put it together in a way that I know works.

51:59.440 --> 52:02.640
 And just being there, being present as the press field is just...

52:02.640 --> 52:04.240
 I'm a big believer just sitting there.

52:04.240 --> 52:07.440
 You've been staring at a blank page, just putting in the time.

52:07.440 --> 52:09.440
 Yeah, and sometimes it's not that way.

52:09.440 --> 52:10.800
 Sometimes it's an inspiration.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.640
 Like, sometimes I'll be sitting there at dinner

52:12.640 --> 52:14.640
 and I'll be like, I got an idea.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.240
 And my wife's really cool about that.

52:16.240 --> 52:19.840
 I'm like, I have an idea and I have to just run out of the room real quick

52:19.840 --> 52:22.640
 and I write it down on my phone and then I can come back.

52:22.640 --> 52:25.040
 Because those are like little gifts

52:25.040 --> 52:27.840
 that you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhere.

52:27.840 --> 52:30.640
 And some people rely only on those gifts.

52:30.640 --> 52:32.640
 And I've talked to comics about it like,

52:32.640 --> 52:34.640
 I can't come up with my best ideas when I don't write.

52:34.640 --> 52:36.640
 And I'm like, no, I do too.

52:36.640 --> 52:39.840
 I come up with great ideas when I don't write, but I also write.

52:39.840 --> 52:41.040
 Like, you can do both of those things.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.640
 They're not mutually exclusive.

52:42.640 --> 52:45.440
 You mentioned fuck you money.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.840
 I feel like I have fuck you money now.

52:47.840 --> 52:50.640
 A year ago, I was at zero, I have fuck you money now

52:50.640 --> 52:55.440
 because probably my standards, I don't need much in this world.

52:55.440 --> 52:58.640
 But because also, probably because of you,

52:58.640 --> 53:03.040
 but it's 300 to 400,000 people, isn't every episode I do.

53:03.040 --> 53:04.240
 It's a lot.

53:04.240 --> 53:05.440
 And that result is weird.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.840
 That's a successful television show on cable.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.040
 Yeah, it's crazy.

53:09.040 --> 53:09.840
 It's all you.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.040
 Yeah, it's hilarious.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.040
 That's amazing.

53:13.040 --> 53:17.040
 But at this point, that also resulted in a few money,

53:17.040 --> 53:21.840
 in a sense that I don't need anything else in this world.

53:21.840 --> 53:25.440
 But so by way of asking, I've looked up,

53:25.440 --> 53:28.240
 if you've inspired me for a long time,

53:28.240 --> 53:30.240
 do you have advice?

53:30.240 --> 53:33.440
 You've done this on the podcast side of life.

53:33.440 --> 53:36.440
 Do you have advice for somebody like me

53:36.440 --> 53:40.240
 and somebody like me going on this journey?

53:40.240 --> 53:43.040
 Eric Weinstein is going on this journey.

53:43.040 --> 53:47.240
 Is there advice, both small and big,

53:47.240 --> 53:50.040
 that you have for somebody like me?

53:50.040 --> 53:53.240
 The advice is to keep doing what feels right to you

53:53.240 --> 53:54.840
 and do what you're doing.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.740
 Obviously, it's resonating with people

53:56.740 --> 53:58.240
 if you're getting that big of an audience.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.540
 And I've listened to your podcast.

53:59.540 --> 54:00.640
 You're very good at it.

54:00.640 --> 54:04.040
 So just keep doing it the way you're doing it.

54:04.040 --> 54:06.540
 Don't let anybody else get involved.

54:06.540 --> 54:08.740
 What about you've connected,

54:08.740 --> 54:10.840
 I think you met Jamie at the comedy store.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.240
 I met him at the ice house.

54:12.240 --> 54:13.240
 At the ice house?

54:13.240 --> 54:14.440
 Well, I think I met him at the comedy store,

54:14.440 --> 54:16.840
 but then we talked at the ice house.

54:16.840 --> 54:18.240
 You'd have to ask him.

54:18.240 --> 54:20.340
 Yeah, did you think deeply about,

54:20.340 --> 54:25.040
 because you basically have nobody on your team.

54:25.040 --> 54:28.840
 And so it almost feels like a marriage.

54:28.840 --> 54:34.040
 Were you selective about somebody to bring into your little circle?

54:34.040 --> 54:35.740
 Well, Jamie's exceptional.

54:35.740 --> 54:37.940
 He is. He's a special.

54:37.940 --> 54:38.940
 I mean, he might have grown.

54:38.940 --> 54:40.640
 I don't remember how he was in the early days.

54:40.640 --> 54:43.240
 Maybe you could say, but he was definitely better at it,

54:43.240 --> 54:45.240
 but he right away, he's exceptional.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.740
 He's got very little ego.

54:47.740 --> 54:50.840
 He's not a guy who needs a lot of attention.

54:50.840 --> 54:57.240
 He's not a guy who overestimates anything,

54:57.240 --> 55:00.440
 like in terms of negative or positive.

55:00.440 --> 55:06.240
 Like his interpretation of whether it's good things

55:06.240 --> 55:08.340
 that happen to the show or bad things that happen to the show,

55:08.340 --> 55:10.840
 he just takes it all like flat.

55:10.840 --> 55:12.240
 He's chill.

55:12.240 --> 55:13.340
 He's just cool as fuck.

55:13.340 --> 55:15.040
 And he's so smart.

55:15.040 --> 55:18.940
 And he's so good as an audio engineer and as a podcast producer.

55:18.940 --> 55:19.840
 He's the best.

55:19.840 --> 55:22.240
 But he's basically one of the only people on this whole team.

55:22.240 --> 55:28.240
 So how do you find, I mean, when you let people in?

55:28.240 --> 55:29.840
 I mean, I'm sure other people want to get involved.

55:29.840 --> 55:31.540
 Like, why don't you have a cohost?

55:31.540 --> 55:34.140
 Like you basically kind of, well.

55:34.140 --> 55:36.340
 Here's the problem with the cohost.

55:36.340 --> 55:39.240
 Like when you and I are talking, when we're talking,

55:39.240 --> 55:44.340
 I'm tuned in to you and I'm waiting to hear what you're saying

55:44.340 --> 55:46.540
 and I'm listening and I'm interpreting it.

55:46.540 --> 55:50.140
 And then I'm calculating whether or not I have anything to say,

55:50.140 --> 55:52.640
 whether it'll let you keep talking,

55:52.640 --> 55:56.140
 whether I maybe have a question that lets you expand further

55:56.140 --> 56:00.940
 or whether I have a disagreement or like there's a dance that's going on.

56:00.940 --> 56:05.440
 Now, when there's another person there chiming in too, it fucks the dance up.

56:05.440 --> 56:06.340
 It's like dancing.

56:06.340 --> 56:09.540
 Like, have you doing a dance with someone, you know,

56:09.540 --> 56:13.240
 like if you're slow dancing with someone and then a third person's there,

56:13.240 --> 56:15.040
 stepping on their feet.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.140
 Sometimes it's fun.

56:16.140 --> 56:16.440
 Yeah.

56:16.440 --> 56:18.140
 Sometimes having a third person is fun.

56:18.140 --> 56:19.040
 Comedy podcast.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.540
 Sometimes it's fun.

56:20.540 --> 56:22.040
 Debate kind of structured.

56:22.040 --> 56:23.040
 Yeah, debate structures.

56:23.040 --> 56:25.840
 But even then it gets difficult because people talk over each other.

56:25.840 --> 56:30.540
 And also, I find that without headphones,

56:30.540 --> 56:32.940
 it's way easier to talk over each other.

56:32.940 --> 56:33.840
 You make mistakes.

56:33.840 --> 56:34.140
 Yeah.

56:34.140 --> 56:36.040
 You don't hear it the same way.

56:36.040 --> 56:38.740
 When you have headphones, I hear what you hear.

56:38.740 --> 56:44.640
 It's all one sound and the audience hears exactly or rather,

56:44.640 --> 56:46.740
 I hear exactly what the audience hears.

56:46.740 --> 56:50.240
 Whether it's over here, my voice is louder than yours

56:50.240 --> 56:52.640
 because you're over there and if I don't have headphones on,

56:52.640 --> 56:54.340
 it's not all together.

56:54.340 --> 56:57.940
 At that point, one of the interesting things about your show

56:57.940 --> 57:04.840
 is you almost never have done and you generally don't do remote calls,

57:04.840 --> 57:08.540
 but you don't go to another person's location.

57:08.540 --> 57:10.440
 You have only done a few for small handful.

57:10.440 --> 57:13.840
 And just like with Sapolsky, he should do this.

57:13.840 --> 57:16.140
 But I actually, we went back and forth on email.

57:16.140 --> 57:20.140
 I told him he needs to get his ass back in the studio.

57:20.140 --> 57:21.440
 He's working on a book.

57:21.440 --> 57:26.740
 I was a fan of his a long time ago because I became obsessed with Toxoplasmosis.

57:26.740 --> 57:33.240
 And I've reached out to him a long time ago before he was willing to do it.

57:33.240 --> 57:35.640
 But then I caught him in downtown LA.

57:35.640 --> 57:40.440
 He was there for something else and I just greedily snatched up an hour of his time.

57:40.440 --> 57:43.240
 Well, he doesn't get, I think, some of those folks don't get

57:43.240 --> 57:45.440
 how much magic can happen in this podcast studio.

57:45.440 --> 57:49.440
 Like bigger than anything they've ever done in terms of their work.

57:49.440 --> 57:53.940
 I'm not talking about reach, but in terms of the discovery of new ideas,

57:53.940 --> 57:55.940
 there's something magical about conversation.

57:55.940 --> 58:00.040
 Like that, like somebody as brilliant as him,

58:00.040 --> 58:04.640
 if he gives himself over to the conversation for multiple hours at a time,

58:04.640 --> 58:06.840
 that's another place where you've been an inspiration.

58:06.840 --> 58:12.340
 Where I like, you know, I'm getting more and more confidence of telling people

58:12.340 --> 58:16.440
 like in Elon Musk that like, you know, a lot of CEOs are like,

58:16.440 --> 58:19.040
 well, he has 30 minutes on his schedule.

58:19.040 --> 58:22.040
 I'm like, no, three hours.

58:22.040 --> 58:28.440
 And then they're like, so some say, no, and then they come back.

58:28.440 --> 58:32.340
 Those people have started coming back to like, okay, we're starting to get it.

58:32.340 --> 58:36.940
 They start to get it and you're a rare beacon of hope in that sense

58:36.940 --> 58:39.140
 that there is some value in long form.

58:39.140 --> 58:43.540
 They think that nobody wants to listen for 30, for more than 30 minutes.

58:43.540 --> 58:45.740
 They think like I have nothing to say.

58:45.740 --> 58:51.140
 But the reality is if you just give yourself over to like the three hours,

58:51.140 --> 58:54.540
 just let it go, three hours, four hours, whatever it is,

58:54.540 --> 58:58.540
 there's so much to discover about what you didn't even know you think.

58:58.540 --> 58:59.540
 Yeah.

58:59.540 --> 59:02.340
 Yeah, you have to be confident that you could do it.

59:02.340 --> 59:07.340
 And in the beginning, I just did it because that's what I wanted to do

59:07.340 --> 59:08.640
 and no one was listening.

59:08.640 --> 59:12.340
 So I've always been a curious person.

59:12.340 --> 59:18.140
 So I've always been interested in listening to how people think about things

59:18.140 --> 59:24.740
 and talking to people about their mindset and just expanding on my own ideas,

59:24.740 --> 59:26.340
 just talking shit.

59:26.340 --> 59:29.340
 And so we would have these podcasts and they would go on forever.

59:29.340 --> 59:35.540
 And my friend Ari, I never let him die and never let this die down.

59:35.540 --> 59:36.940
 Never let him forget this.

59:36.940 --> 59:38.540
 He was always like, you have to edit your podcast.

59:38.540 --> 59:40.140
 I'm telling you right now, you're fucking up.

59:40.140 --> 59:41.440
 I go, why?

59:41.440 --> 59:43.040
 He's like, because people are not going to listen to it.

59:43.040 --> 59:44.640
 I go, they don't have to.

59:44.640 --> 59:45.140
 Yeah.

59:45.140 --> 59:46.040
 I go, you listen to part of it.

59:46.040 --> 59:48.140
 He goes, just do it.

59:48.140 --> 59:50.840
 I'm telling you, trust me, cut it down to like 45 minutes.

59:50.840 --> 59:51.840
 It's all you need.

59:51.840 --> 59:54.540
 And I'm like, no, no, I don't think you're right.

59:54.540 --> 59:56.540
 I like listening to long form things.

59:56.540 --> 59:57.940
 No one has that kind of time.

59:57.940 --> 59:59.640
 I go, okay, I'm going to do it.

59:59.640 --> 1:00:01.440
 I'm just going to keep doing it this way.

1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:03.440
 So stick to your gut.

1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:04.240
 No, he doesn't.

1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:06.440
 Listen to his or like two and a half hours long now.

1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:07.640
 That's great.

1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:08.740
 You won.

1:00:08.740 --> 1:00:11.440
 But you wouldn't like say, I mentioned to you this before.

1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:12.840
 This is going to happen.

1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:14.440
 It's actually made a lot of progress towards it.

1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:17.840
 I'm going to talk to Putin, but you wouldn't travel to Putin.

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:19.040
 If you want to talk to you.

1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:21.240
 Putin is a dangerous character.

1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:22.640
 He's not.

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:23.240
 He's not.

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:26.440
 You're talking to, you've seen the thing with Jerry Kraft,

1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:27.840
 where he stole his Superbowl ring.

1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:28.840
 Yeah.

1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:31.640
 Yeah, that was, I think that was a little bit of misunderstanding.

1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:33.040
 Oh, really?

1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:34.840
 I think it's a little bit, he just decided he's going to steal

1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:35.940
 that Superbowl ring.

1:00:35.940 --> 1:00:36.640
 Kind of.

1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:39.740
 I think it was a kind of, he thought, can I see your ring?

1:00:39.740 --> 1:00:41.540
 He shows him his ring and then he puts it on and says,

1:00:41.540 --> 1:00:43.140
 I can murder somebody with this ring.

1:00:43.140 --> 1:00:44.640
 So he, and then he walks off with it.

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:49.540
 It's possible he did it as a, he's a big believer in displays

1:00:49.540 --> 1:00:50.340
 of power.

1:00:50.340 --> 1:00:51.140
 Yeah.

1:00:51.140 --> 1:00:52.740
 So like, it's possible he did that.

1:00:52.740 --> 1:00:58.740
 But I think he sees himself as like a tool with which

1:00:58.740 --> 1:01:01.840
 to demonstrate that Russia still belongs on the stage

1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:03.540
 of the big players.

1:01:03.540 --> 1:01:07.740
 And so he, a lot of actions are selected through that lens.

1:01:07.740 --> 1:01:12.640
 But in terms of a human being outside of any of the evils

1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:18.840
 that he may or may not have done, he is a really thoughtful,

1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:24.640
 intelligent, fun human being like the wit and the depth

1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:27.540
 from the JRE perspective is really interesting.

1:01:27.540 --> 1:01:30.940
 I'm like his manager now selling the, he's a judo guy.

1:01:30.940 --> 1:01:33.140
 He's really good at judo.

1:01:33.140 --> 1:01:34.940
 I have seen him practice judo.

1:01:34.940 --> 1:01:36.240
 He's a legit black belt.

1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:40.840
 And not only that, he loves it, not just skill wise, but to talk

1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:44.440
 about it, to reason about it, to think about it, to MMA as well.

1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:47.540
 So, you know, it'd be, it'd be a good conversation.

1:01:47.540 --> 1:01:48.840
 But you wouldn't travel to him.

1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:53.740
 Well, that's, hold to your principle.

1:01:53.740 --> 1:01:54.940
 So that's the core of the advice.

1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:56.140
 Just hold to whatever.

1:01:56.140 --> 1:02:01.740
 I would rather, here's the thing, there's not a person that

1:02:01.740 --> 1:02:03.340
 I have to have on the show.

1:02:03.340 --> 1:02:04.140
 Right.

1:02:04.140 --> 1:02:06.240
 And I would, I'm happy to talk to anybody.

1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:10.140
 I'm just as happy to talk to you as I am to talk to Trump as

1:02:10.140 --> 1:02:12.940
 I am to probably more happy to talk to you as I am to talk to

1:02:12.940 --> 1:02:15.440
 Mike Tyson as I am to talk to Joey Diaz.

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:17.040
 I like talking to people.

1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:19.040
 I enjoy doing podcasts.

1:02:19.040 --> 1:02:24.140
 I enjoy talking to a variety of people and I schedule them based

1:02:24.140 --> 1:02:27.240
 on, I want to like, I try not to get too many right wing people

1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:29.440
 in a row or too many progressive people in a row.

1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:32.340
 I don't want to get repetitive to try not to get too many fighters

1:02:32.340 --> 1:02:33.240
 in a row.

1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:34.240
 I try to balance it out.

1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:35.440
 Not too many comedians.

1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:39.340
 Comedians are the one, one group where I can have three, four

1:02:39.340 --> 1:02:42.140
 in a row, five in a row, because that's my tribe.

1:02:42.140 --> 1:02:43.340
 You know, those are my people.

1:02:43.340 --> 1:02:44.240
 It's easy.

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:45.740
 We can talk about anything.

1:02:45.740 --> 1:02:49.140
 It's a weird dance, you know, the conversations that you're

1:02:49.140 --> 1:02:52.940
 doing on a podcast are, they're a strange dance.

1:02:52.940 --> 1:02:56.440
 And you want to, you know, you want to not step on your own

1:02:56.440 --> 1:03:00.840
 feet and you want to make sure that you do it in a way, do

1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:02.840
 the podcast in a way that's entertaining for people.

1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:07.140
 And it's, it's conversations are learning how to talk to

1:03:07.140 --> 1:03:10.340
 people. It's a weird skill. It's a weird skill that took a long

1:03:10.340 --> 1:03:11.740
 time for me to get good at.

1:03:11.740 --> 1:03:14.540
 And I didn't know it was a skill until I started doing it.

1:03:14.540 --> 1:03:16.740
 And then I just thought you're just talking.

1:03:16.740 --> 1:03:17.940
 Like, I know how to talk.

1:03:17.940 --> 1:03:19.040
 We just talk to people.

1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:21.340
 And then along the way, I realized like, oh, and then when

1:03:21.340 --> 1:03:24.140
 you talk to people that are bad at it, you realize that it's

1:03:24.140 --> 1:03:24.940
 a skill.

1:03:24.940 --> 1:03:29.040
 Like particularly one of the things about my people, about

1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:32.940
 comedians is a lot of them tend to want to talk, but don't

1:03:32.940 --> 1:03:33.940
 want to listen.

1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:34.940
 Right.

1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:38.740
 So they're, they're waiting for you to stop talking so they

1:03:38.740 --> 1:03:41.740
 can talk, but they're not necessarily thinking about what

1:03:41.740 --> 1:03:44.840
 you're saying, you know, and they're just, just waiting

1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:47.840
 for their opportunity or they talk over you or they, and I

1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:49.240
 try real hard not to do that.

1:03:49.240 --> 1:03:54.340
 And sometimes I fail, but my, when I'm at my best, I'm, I'm

1:03:54.340 --> 1:03:54.940
 dancing.

1:03:54.940 --> 1:03:55.140
 Yeah.

1:03:55.140 --> 1:03:58.240
 Ultimately, the skill conversation is just really

1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:02.340
 listening, like really and listening and thinking, listening

1:04:02.340 --> 1:04:06.040
 and thinking and being genuinely curious and, and really

1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:11.240
 having, you know, a take on what they're saying and, and, and

1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:14.640
 a, and a, maybe a follow up question or maybe, you know,

1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:15.940
 just got to, it's got to be real.

1:04:15.940 --> 1:04:17.040
 It's got to be authentic.

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:20.140
 And when it is authentic and it's real, it resonates with

1:04:20.140 --> 1:04:23.440
 people, like they're listening and they go, oh, like I'm locked

1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:26.540
 in with the way you're thinking, like you two guys are in a

1:04:26.540 --> 1:04:30.240
 conversation and I'm locked in, you know, when she talks and

1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:33.940
 you listen, I'm listening to, you know, when he says something

1:04:33.940 --> 1:04:37.340
 to her or when she says something to, to him, like there's

1:04:37.340 --> 1:04:40.940
 a thing that happens during conversations where you're there,

1:04:40.940 --> 1:04:44.240
 like you're listening to a, and it's with me, when I listen

1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:47.040
 to a good podcast, I feel like I'm in the room.

1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:49.440
 I feel like I'm in the room and I'm like, like I'm, I'm like

1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:53.140
 the friend that got to sit down and listen, like, oh, yeah,

1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:54.440
 it's a great conversation.

1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:54.840
 Yeah.

1:04:54.840 --> 1:04:56.240
 You know, I love conversations.

1:04:56.240 --> 1:04:59.640
 So I love listening to them and I love putting them together

1:04:59.640 --> 1:05:03.840
 and the fact that this podcast has gotten so fucking big.

1:05:04.340 --> 1:05:06.340
 It's stunning to me.

1:05:06.340 --> 1:05:07.240
 It blows me away.

1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:09.040
 No, I'd never anticipated it.

1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:12.140
 Never thought for a second that that stupid thing that I used

1:05:12.140 --> 1:05:15.940
 to do in my couch, in my, my office was the biggest thing

1:05:15.940 --> 1:05:18.240
 I've ever done in my life by far.

1:05:18.540 --> 1:05:20.040
 Like people used to make fun of it.

1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:22.440
 Like there's a comedy store documentary that's coming out.

1:05:22.740 --> 1:05:25.040
 And one of the parts of the documentary is my friend,

1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:28.640
 Tom Segura, when he first started doing my podcast, he would,

1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:30.440
 he would be leaving and he would talk to Red Band.

1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:31.940
 He's like, what the fuck is he doing?

1:05:31.940 --> 1:05:32.240
 Yeah.

1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:33.440
 Like, why is he doing this?

1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:34.240
 Like, who's listening?

1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:35.840
 He's like, oh, some people like it.

1:05:35.940 --> 1:05:36.240
 Yeah.

1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:38.840
 And he's like fucking nonsense, wasted time.

1:05:38.940 --> 1:05:43.040
 And like in the, the documentary shows like 2,000 views,

1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:45.040
 like one of the early Ustream episodes.

1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:45.740
 It's hilarious.

1:05:45.940 --> 1:05:47.640
 And they don't just like it really.

1:05:48.340 --> 1:05:50.340
 They, uh, they form a friendship with you.

1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:54.740
 It's like, uh, even me when people come up to me, like the love

1:05:54.740 --> 1:05:56.540
 in their eyes is kind of beautiful.

1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:57.440
 It's weird, right?

1:05:57.540 --> 1:05:57.840
 Yeah.

1:05:57.840 --> 1:05:59.340
 It's like, uh, you're part of their life.

1:05:59.340 --> 1:05:59.640
 Yeah.

1:05:59.740 --> 1:06:00.840
 And I don't know.

1:06:00.840 --> 1:06:04.740
 It's, it's also heartbreaking cause you realize you'll never

1:06:04.740 --> 1:06:06.540
 really get to know them back.

1:06:06.540 --> 1:06:09.640
 Like cause they, they clearly are friends with you.

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:10.840
 Yes.

1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:11.240
 Yeah.

1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:13.940
 And it's sad to see a person who's clearly brilliant and

1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:18.040
 interesting and is friends with you, but you don't get a

1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:20.140
 chance to return that love.

1:06:20.140 --> 1:06:23.540
 And, uh, I mean, my kids, it took them a while to figure

1:06:23.540 --> 1:06:28.140
 out what's going on, but, uh, people would come up to me and, uh,

1:06:28.340 --> 1:06:30.640
 you know, they would say something like, Hey man, I fucking

1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:31.040
 love you.

1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:31.840
 Thanks man.

1:06:31.940 --> 1:06:32.440
 All right.

1:06:32.440 --> 1:06:32.940
 Hey brother.

1:06:32.940 --> 1:06:33.540
 Nice to meet you.

1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:35.040
 My daughter was like six.

1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:36.140
 She'd be like, do you know him?

1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:36.740
 Yeah.

1:06:36.740 --> 1:06:37.740
 I'm like, no, I don't know him.

1:06:37.740 --> 1:06:39.340
 She's like, how does he know you?

1:06:41.340 --> 1:06:44.040
 It's very weird conversation.

1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:47.840
 I used to have with young kids when I'd explain, I'd do this

1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:50.640
 thing called the podcast and millions of people listen.

1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:55.040
 So now one of my daughters is 12 and one of her friends is

1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:57.840
 13 and he's a boy and he goes to school with her and he's

1:06:57.840 --> 1:06:58.640
 obsessed with me.

1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:01.540
 And so she's weirded out and she says to him, I don't even

1:07:01.540 --> 1:07:02.340
 think you like me.

1:07:02.340 --> 1:07:04.740
 I think you're just into my dad, you fucking weirdo.

1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:08.340
 She's going to have that conversation in a few stages

1:07:08.340 --> 1:07:11.940
 in her life, like that hard conversation with a boyfriend.

1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:13.240
 Yeah, probably.

1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:13.740
 Yeah.

1:07:13.740 --> 1:07:15.840
 That was the thing about men too.

1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:21.940
 This podcast is, my podcast is uniquely masculine.

1:07:22.340 --> 1:07:27.240
 I'm a man and I'm not, I'm also a man that doesn't have to go

1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:29.040
 through some sort of a corporate filter.

1:07:29.240 --> 1:07:32.740
 I'm not going through executive producers who tell me don't,

1:07:32.940 --> 1:07:35.440
 don't have this guest on, don't talk about that.

1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:37.740
 You know, we looked at focus groups and they don't, they

1:07:37.740 --> 1:07:39.040
 don't seem to like when you do this.

1:07:39.340 --> 1:07:40.240
 Like there's none of that.

1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:43.140
 I just, and I, I just do it.

1:07:43.140 --> 1:07:45.640
 So if that's, oh, so I have a whole podcast where I just talk

1:07:45.640 --> 1:07:48.140
 about cars and people like, I don't want to hear you talk

1:07:48.140 --> 1:07:48.540
 about cars.

1:07:48.540 --> 1:07:49.040
 Well, good.

1:07:49.140 --> 1:07:50.140
 Congratulations.

1:07:50.940 --> 1:07:51.740
 You found what you like.

1:07:51.940 --> 1:07:52.740
 Here's good news.

1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:54.540
 There's 1500 other ones.

1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:56.840
 Go listen to the other episodes where I don't talk about cars.

1:07:57.340 --> 1:07:58.640
 You don't, you don't have to listen.

1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:02.840
 And it's not like your brand, you just are who you are.

1:08:02.940 --> 1:08:03.640
 And that's what you do.

1:08:04.040 --> 1:08:08.340
 But it's like, it's authentically what I'm interested in.

1:08:08.540 --> 1:08:11.640
 All the podcasts, whether I'm talking to David Fraver about

1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:16.240
 his experience with UFOs, whether I'm talking to David Sinclair

1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:19.040
 about life extension, whether I'm talking to you about

1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:20.440
 artificial intelligence or what.

1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:23.040
 It's because I want to talk to these people.

1:08:23.540 --> 1:08:25.340
 And that, that resonates.

1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:28.040
 I, I like when people are into shit.

1:08:28.340 --> 1:08:30.240
 You know, I've talked about this before, like things that I

1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:33.440
 have no interest in making furniture, but I like this PBS

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:35.540
 show where this guy makes furniture by hand.

1:08:35.740 --> 1:08:37.840
 I love watching it because he's so into it.

1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:39.940
 He's extending this and polishing that.

1:08:39.940 --> 1:08:40.840
 I'm not going to do that.

1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:42.340
 I don't give a fuck about furniture.

1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:45.740
 Furniture for me is function, like this desk function.

1:08:45.740 --> 1:08:49.040
 It works, but I love when people are into it, you know, and I'm

1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:51.440
 happy that someone can make it and they do a great job.

1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:57.440
 But I'm not, I'm not interested in the, the task is or the, even

1:08:57.440 --> 1:09:00.740
 the finished product as much as I'm interested in someone's

1:09:00.740 --> 1:09:01.740
 passion for something.

1:09:01.740 --> 1:09:04.440
 The passion that they've put into this that shines through.

1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:05.940
 Last question.

1:09:05.940 --> 1:09:11.640
 I sometimes ask this just for to, uh, what is it to challenge,

1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:15.240
 to make people roll their eyes, to make legitimate scientists

1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:19.040
 roll their eyes, ask, uh, uh, what is the meaning of life?

1:09:19.740 --> 1:09:22.740
 According to Joe Rogan, do you not think there is a meaning?

1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:25.240
 I think there's many, many meanings of life.

1:09:25.540 --> 1:09:28.640
 I think there's a way to navigate life that's enjoyable.

1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:30.840
 I think it requires many things.

1:09:31.140 --> 1:09:33.540
 It requires, first of all, it requires love.

1:09:33.540 --> 1:09:36.640
 You have to have loved ones, you have to have family, you have

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:39.340
 to have friends, you have to have people that care about you

1:09:39.340 --> 1:09:40.740
 and you have to care about them.

1:09:40.940 --> 1:09:42.840
 I think that is primary.

1:09:43.340 --> 1:09:46.140
 Then it also requires interests.

1:09:46.340 --> 1:09:48.440
 There has to be things that stimulate you.

1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:51.340
 Now it could be just a subsistence lifestyle.

1:09:51.340 --> 1:09:56.340
 There's many people that believe and practice this, uh, lifestyle

1:09:56.340 --> 1:09:59.340
 of just living off the land and hunting and fishing and living

1:09:59.340 --> 1:10:01.640
 in the woods and they seem incredibly happy.

1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:02.140
 Yeah.

1:10:02.140 --> 1:10:04.340
 And there's, there's something to be said for that.

1:10:04.540 --> 1:10:06.040
 That is an interest, right?

1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:08.940
 There's something and there's a, there's a direct connection

1:10:08.940 --> 1:10:11.540
 between their actions and their sustenance.

1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:13.040
 They, they get their food that way.

1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:16.240
 They're connected to nature and it's very satisfying for them.

1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:20.540
 If you don't have that, uh, I think you need something

1:10:20.540 --> 1:10:24.340
 that is interesting to you, something that's you're passionate

1:10:24.340 --> 1:10:28.440
 about and there's far too many people that get sucked into living

1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:32.340
 a life where you're just doing a job.

1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:34.840
 You're just showing up and putting in your time and then going

1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:37.140
 home, but you don't have a passion for what you're doing.

1:10:37.140 --> 1:10:41.740
 And I think that is, that's the recipe for a boring and very

1:10:41.740 --> 1:10:42.940
 unfulfilling life.

1:10:42.940 --> 1:10:47.540
 You mentioned love if you could backtrack what, uh, we talked

1:10:47.540 --> 1:10:50.940
 about the demons and the violence in there somewhere.

1:10:50.940 --> 1:10:54.540
 What's the role of love in this, in your own life?

1:10:54.540 --> 1:10:58.140
 It's very important, man, and it, that's one of the reasons

1:10:58.140 --> 1:11:02.940
 why I'm so, uh, I'm so interested in helping people.

1:11:03.340 --> 1:11:06.340
 I'm very interested in people feeling good.

1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:08.440
 I like them to feel good.

1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:09.740
 I want to help them.

1:11:09.740 --> 1:11:12.140
 I like, I like doing things that make them feel like, oh, you

1:11:12.140 --> 1:11:12.740
 care about me.

1:11:12.740 --> 1:11:13.740
 Like, yeah, I care about you.

1:11:13.940 --> 1:11:14.740
 I really do.

1:11:14.940 --> 1:11:16.340
 Like I want people to feel good.

1:11:16.340 --> 1:11:18.140
 I want my family to feel good.

1:11:18.140 --> 1:11:19.540
 I want my friends to feel good.

1:11:19.540 --> 1:11:22.940
 I want guests to feel good about the podcast experience.

1:11:22.940 --> 1:11:26.940
 You know, I, I am, uh, I'm a big believer in as much as I

1:11:26.940 --> 1:11:31.940
 can to spread positive energy and joy and happiness and, and

1:11:31.940 --> 1:11:35.940
 relay all the good advice that I've ever gotten all the things

1:11:35.940 --> 1:11:36.940
 that I've learned.

1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:38.940
 And if they can benefit people, then I find that those things

1:11:38.940 --> 1:11:41.940
 benefit people that actually improve the quality of their

1:11:41.940 --> 1:11:44.940
 life or improve their success or improve their relationships

1:11:44.940 --> 1:11:46.940
 or I'm very happy to do that.

1:11:46.940 --> 1:11:48.940
 That means a lot to me.

1:11:48.940 --> 1:11:52.940
 The way we interact with each other is so important.

1:11:52.940 --> 1:11:56.940
 It's one of the reasons why like someone gets canceled or you

1:11:56.940 --> 1:11:57.940
 get publicly shamed.

1:11:57.940 --> 1:12:00.940
 It's so devastating because there's all these people that

1:12:00.940 --> 1:12:03.940
 negative, all this negative energy coming your way and you

1:12:03.940 --> 1:12:06.940
 feel it as much as you like to pretend that you, you're immune

1:12:06.940 --> 1:12:07.940
 to that kind of stuff.

1:12:07.940 --> 1:12:09.940
 And some people do like to pretend that you feel it.

1:12:09.940 --> 1:12:12.940
 There's a, there's a tangible force when people are upset at

1:12:12.940 --> 1:12:17.940
 you and that's the same with loved ones or family or anytime

1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:21.940
 someone's upset at you, whether it's a giant group of people or

1:12:21.940 --> 1:12:23.940
 there's a small amount of people.

1:12:23.940 --> 1:12:27.940
 That has an impact on you and your psyche and your physical

1:12:27.940 --> 1:12:28.940
 being.

1:12:28.940 --> 1:12:32.940
 So the more you can spread love and the more love comes back

1:12:32.940 --> 1:12:35.940
 to you, you also create this butterfly effect, right?

1:12:35.940 --> 1:12:38.940
 Because where other people start recognizing like, oh, you

1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:41.940
 know when he is nice to me, I feel better and then I'm going

1:12:41.940 --> 1:12:43.940
 to be nicer to people.

1:12:43.940 --> 1:12:45.940
 And when I'm nicer to people, they feel better and I feel

1:12:45.940 --> 1:12:47.940
 better and it spreads outward.

1:12:47.940 --> 1:12:49.940
 And that's one thing that I've done through this podcast, I

1:12:49.940 --> 1:12:54.940
 think, is I've imparted my personal philosophy in kindness

1:12:54.940 --> 1:12:56.940
 and generosity to other people.

1:12:56.940 --> 1:12:59.940
 Yeah, I mean, to correct you, you didn't do it.

1:12:59.940 --> 1:13:01.940
 The ideas that are breeding themselves through your brain

1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:02.940
 have figured out.

1:13:02.940 --> 1:13:05.940
 Yes, the ideas that are alive in the air have made their way

1:13:05.940 --> 1:13:06.940
 into my head.

1:13:06.940 --> 1:13:09.940
 Love is a more efficient mechanism of spreading ideas they

1:13:09.940 --> 1:13:10.940
 figured out.

1:13:10.940 --> 1:13:11.940
 Yes.

1:13:11.940 --> 1:13:13.940
 Probably, man.

1:13:13.940 --> 1:13:15.940
 Probably.

1:13:15.940 --> 1:13:21.940
 So as far as like the meaning of life, that's a bit, without

1:13:21.940 --> 1:13:22.940
 that, you have nothing.

1:13:22.940 --> 1:13:25.940
 You know, one of the biggest failures in life is to be

1:13:25.940 --> 1:13:27.940
 extremely successful financially, but everybody hates

1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:28.940
 you.

1:13:28.940 --> 1:13:30.940
 Everybody hates you and you're just miserable and alone and

1:13:30.940 --> 1:13:32.940
 angry and depressed and sad.

1:13:32.940 --> 1:13:34.940
 You know, when you hear about rich, famous people that

1:13:34.940 --> 1:13:38.940
 commit suicide, like, wow, you missed the mark.

1:13:38.940 --> 1:13:42.940
 You got some parts right, but you put too many eggs in one

1:13:42.940 --> 1:13:43.940
 basket.

1:13:43.940 --> 1:13:46.940
 You put too many eggs in the financial basket or the

1:13:46.940 --> 1:13:49.940
 success basket or the accomplishment basket and not

1:13:49.940 --> 1:13:51.940
 enough in the friendship and love basket.

1:13:51.940 --> 1:13:53.940
 And there's a balance to that.

1:13:53.940 --> 1:13:56.940
 And when I talked about the violence and all that stuff,

1:13:56.940 --> 1:13:59.940
 like, that to me is me understanding, recognizing that

1:13:59.940 --> 1:14:02.940
 is me trying to achieve that balance.

1:14:02.940 --> 1:14:05.940
 It's to, like, go kill those demons so that this boat is

1:14:05.940 --> 1:14:08.940
 level, you know, because if it's not, then the boat is

1:14:08.940 --> 1:14:10.940
 like this and then everything's all fucked up and

1:14:10.940 --> 1:14:12.940
 every time we hit a wave, things fall apart.

1:14:12.940 --> 1:14:13.940
 Balance that boat out.

1:14:13.940 --> 1:14:14.940
 Figure it out.

1:14:14.940 --> 1:14:16.940
 Like, know who you are.

1:14:16.940 --> 1:14:18.940
 Some people don't have that problem at all.

1:14:18.940 --> 1:14:20.940
 Some people, they could just go for walks and they're

1:14:20.940 --> 1:14:21.940
 cool as a cucumber.

1:14:21.940 --> 1:14:22.940
 I need more.

1:14:22.940 --> 1:14:24.940
 You know, I need kettlebells.

1:14:24.940 --> 1:14:25.940
 I need a heavy bag.

1:14:25.940 --> 1:14:29.940
 I need the echo bike, you know, the aerosol bike.

1:14:29.940 --> 1:14:31.940
 I need some hardcore shit.

1:14:31.940 --> 1:14:33.940
 And if I don't get that, I don't feel good.

1:14:33.940 --> 1:14:35.940
 So I figured that out, too.

1:14:35.940 --> 1:14:37.940
 And that makes me a nicer person.

1:14:37.940 --> 1:14:39.940
 And that makes my interactions nicer.

1:14:39.940 --> 1:14:44.940
 It changes the quality of my friendships and my relationships

1:14:44.940 --> 1:14:45.940
 with people.

1:14:45.940 --> 1:14:48.940
 I think we mentioned Neuralink.

1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:52.940
 I can certainly guarantee that this is one of the memories

1:14:52.940 --> 1:14:55.940
 I'll be replaying 20, 30 years from now once we get

1:14:55.940 --> 1:14:56.940
 the feature ready.

1:14:56.940 --> 1:14:58.940
 Joe, it's a huge honor to talk to you.

1:14:58.940 --> 1:15:00.940
 It's an honor to talk to you, too, man.

1:15:00.940 --> 1:15:02.940
 I'm glad you came down here for this.

1:15:02.940 --> 1:15:06.940
 The first week of me doing this here and it's very cool

1:15:06.940 --> 1:15:07.940
 to have you always.

1:15:07.940 --> 1:15:12.940
 I hope you make Texas cool again and do your podcast

1:15:12.940 --> 1:15:15.940
 another 10, 11, whatever, however many years you're still

1:15:15.940 --> 1:15:16.940
 on this earth.

1:15:16.940 --> 1:15:17.940
 All right.

1:15:17.940 --> 1:15:18.940
 Thank you, brother.

1:15:18.940 --> 1:15:19.940
