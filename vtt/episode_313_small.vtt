00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
 Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.560
 And if you gaze into the abyss,

00:05.560 --> 00:08.960
 the abyss gazes also into you.

00:08.960 --> 00:12.200
 But I would say, bring it on.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.280
 If you gaze into the abyss long enough,

00:15.280 --> 00:17.240
 you see the light, not the darkness.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.200
 Are you sure about that?

00:20.200 --> 00:21.680
 I'm betting my life on it.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.240
 The following is a conversation with Jordan Peterson,

00:27.240 --> 00:30.840
 an influential psychologist, lecturer, podcast host,

00:30.840 --> 00:33.320
 and author of Maps of Meaning,

00:33.320 --> 00:37.760
 12 Rules for Life, and Beyond Order.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.680
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.680
 The supported, please check out our sponsors

00:41.680 --> 00:43.000
 in the description.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.960
 And now, dear friends, here's Jordan Peterson.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.440
 Dostoevsky wrote, in The Idiot,

00:50.440 --> 00:52.880
 spoken through the character of Prince Mishkin,

00:52.880 --> 00:55.120
 that beauty will save the world.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.680
 Solzhenitsyn actually mentioned this

00:56.680 --> 01:00.200
 in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.480
 What do you think Dostoevsky meant by that?

01:02.480 --> 01:04.120
 Was he right?

01:04.120 --> 01:09.120
 Well, I guess it's the divine that saves the world,

01:10.080 --> 01:13.160
 let's say, you could say that by definition.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.400
 And then you might say, well, are there pointers

01:16.400 --> 01:18.280
 to that which will save the world,

01:18.280 --> 01:20.120
 or that which eternally saves the world?

01:20.120 --> 01:23.360
 And the answer to that, in all likelihood, is yes.

01:23.360 --> 01:27.640
 And that's maybe truth and love and justice

01:27.640 --> 01:30.280
 and the classical virtues.

01:30.280 --> 01:34.640
 Beauty, perhaps in some sense, foremost among them.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.640
 That's a difficult case to make, but definitely a pointer.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.480
 Which direction is the arrow pointing?

01:39.480 --> 01:40.640
 Well, the arrow's pointing up.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.280
 And no, I think that that which it points to

01:43.280 --> 01:45.000
 is what beauty points to.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.360
 It transcends beauty.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.480
 It's more than beauty.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.400
 And that speaks to the divine.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.240
 It points to the divine.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.240
 Yeah, and I would say again, by definition,

01:53.240 --> 01:56.480
 because we could define the divine in some real sense.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.360
 So one way of defining the divine is,

01:59.360 --> 02:03.440
 what is divine to you is your most fundamental axiom.

02:03.440 --> 02:06.000
 And you might say, well, I don't have a fundamental axiom.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.600
 Then I would say, that's fine, but then you're just confused.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.960
 Because you have a bunch of contradictory axioms.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.040
 And you might say, well, I have no axioms at all.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.640
 And then I'd say, well, you're just epistemologically ignorant

02:16.640 --> 02:19.000
 beyond comprehension, if you think that.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.640
 Because that's just not true at all.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.200
 So do you don't think a human being can exist within contradictions?

02:24.200 --> 02:26.320
 Well, yeah, we have to exist within contradiction.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.880
 But when the contradictions make themselves manifest,

02:29.880 --> 02:33.080
 say in confusion with regard to direction,

02:33.080 --> 02:37.840
 then the consequence of that technically is anxiety

02:37.840 --> 02:39.400
 and frustration and disappointment

02:39.400 --> 02:41.080
 and all sorts of other negative emotions.

02:41.080 --> 02:45.240
 But the cardinal negative emotion signifying

02:45.240 --> 02:48.920
 multiple pathways forward is anxiety.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.120
 It's an entropy signal.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.920
 But you don't think that kind of entropy signal

02:53.920 --> 02:58.560
 can be channeled into beauty, into love?

02:58.560 --> 03:04.520
 Why does beauty and love have to be clear, ordered, simple?

03:04.520 --> 03:09.600
 Well, I would say it probably doesn't have to be,

03:09.600 --> 03:13.720
 it can't be reduced to clarity and simplicity.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.920
 Because when it's optimally structured,

03:15.920 --> 03:20.920
 it's a balance between order and chaos, not order itself.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.320
 If it's too ordered, if music is too ordered,

03:23.320 --> 03:25.240
 it's not acceptable.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.600
 It sounds like a drum machine.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.800
 It's too repetitive.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.600
 It's too predictable.

03:29.600 --> 03:34.400
 It has to have, well, it has to have some fire in it

03:34.400 --> 03:36.080
 along with the structure.

03:36.080 --> 03:40.800
 I was in Miami doing a seminar on Exodus

03:40.800 --> 03:42.240
 with a number of scholars.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.920
 And this is a beauty discussion.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.440
 When Moses first encounters the burning bush,

03:49.440 --> 03:52.440
 it's not a conflagration that demands attention.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.640
 It's something that catches his attention.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.000
 It's a phenomena, and that means to shine forth.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.320
 And Moses has to stop and attend to it, and he does.

04:01.320 --> 04:05.600
 And he sees this fire that doesn't consume the tree.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.760
 And the tree, the tree is a structure, right?

04:07.760 --> 04:09.040
 It's a tree like structure.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.160
 It's a branching structure.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.120
 It's a hierarchical structure.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.040
 It's a self similar structure.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.040
 It's a fractal structure.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.200
 And it's the tree of life.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.040
 And it's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

04:19.040 --> 04:23.080
 And the fire in it is the transformation

04:23.080 --> 04:25.400
 that's always occurring within every structure.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.600
 And the fact that the fire doesn't consume the bush

04:28.600 --> 04:33.120
 in that representation is an indication of the balance

04:33.120 --> 04:35.040
 of transformation with structure.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.960
 And that balance is presented as God.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.200
 And what attracts Moses to it, in some sense,

04:41.200 --> 04:42.360
 is the beauty.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.840
 Now, it's the novelty and all that,

04:43.840 --> 04:46.520
 but like a painting is like a burning bush.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.800
 That's a good way of thinking about it, a great painting.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.360
 It's too much for people often.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.120
 My house was, and will soon be again,

04:55.120 --> 04:58.240
 completely covered with paintings inside.

04:58.240 --> 05:01.840
 And it was hard on people to come in there

05:01.840 --> 05:04.360
 because, well, my mother, for example,

05:04.360 --> 05:07.120
 say, well, why would you want to live in a museum?

05:07.120 --> 05:09.240
 And I'd think, well, I would rather live in a museum

05:09.240 --> 05:10.880
 than anywhere else in some real sense.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.280
 But beauty is daunting.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.120
 It scares people.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.240
 They're terrified of buying art, for example,

05:17.240 --> 05:18.760
 because their taste is on display.

05:18.760 --> 05:19.760
 And they should be terrified

05:19.760 --> 05:22.320
 because generally people have terrible taste.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.520
 Now, that doesn't mean they shouldn't foster it

05:24.520 --> 05:26.400
 and develop it, but, and, you know,

05:26.400 --> 05:28.440
 when you put your taste on display,

05:28.440 --> 05:30.720
 it's a real, really exposes you.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.560
 Even to yourself as you walk past it every day.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.640
 Oh, definitely.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.480
 Absolutely.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.320
 This is who I am.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.360
 Yeah, well, and look how mundane that is,

05:38.360 --> 05:39.760
 and look how trite it is,

05:39.760 --> 05:41.360
 and look at how cliched it is,

05:41.360 --> 05:43.760
 and look at how sterile or too ordered it is,

05:43.760 --> 05:45.120
 or too chaotic.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.160
 Or how quickly you start to take it for granted

05:47.160 --> 05:48.560
 because you've seen it so many times.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.560
 Well, if it's a real piece of art, that doesn't happen.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.360
 You notice the little details.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.680
 The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.000
 I mean, there are images,

05:58.080 --> 05:59.600
 religious images in particular,

05:59.600 --> 06:02.080
 so we could call them deep images

06:02.080 --> 06:07.000
 that people have been unpacking for 4,000 years

06:07.000 --> 06:07.840
 and still have it.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.200
 I'll give you an example.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.720
 This is a terrible example.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.840
 So I did a lecture series on Genesis,

06:15.840 --> 06:18.040
 and I got a lot of it unpacked,

06:18.040 --> 06:19.600
 but by no means all of it.

06:21.400 --> 06:25.160
 When God kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden,

06:25.160 --> 06:28.400
 he puts cherubim with flaming swords at the gate

06:28.400 --> 06:31.880
 to stop human beings from reentering paradise.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.160
 I thought, what the hell does that mean, cherubim?

06:34.160 --> 06:35.760
 And why do they have flaming swords?

06:35.760 --> 06:36.600
 I don't get that.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.720
 What is that exactly?

06:38.720 --> 06:41.280
 And then I found out from Matthew Pascio,

06:41.280 --> 06:44.200
 who wrote a great book on symbolism in Genesis,

06:44.200 --> 06:48.120
 that cherubim are the supporting monsters of God.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.120
 It's a very complicated idea,

06:50.120 --> 06:53.720
 and that they're partly a representation of that,

06:53.720 --> 06:57.120
 which is difficult to fit into conceptual systems.

06:57.120 --> 07:01.000
 They've also got an angelic or demonic aspect.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.280
 Take your pick.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.280
 Why do they have flaming swords?

07:04.280 --> 07:07.600
 Well, a sword is a symbol of judgment

07:07.600 --> 07:12.600
 and the separation of the wheat from the chaff.

07:13.320 --> 07:18.320
 Use a sword to cut away, to cut away and to carve.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.120
 And a flaming sword is not only that which carves,

07:21.120 --> 07:23.200
 it's that which burns.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.680
 And what is it carve away and burn?

07:25.680 --> 07:27.400
 Well, you wanna get into paradise?

07:28.360 --> 07:32.480
 It carves away everything about you that isn't perfect.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.040
 And so what does that mean?

07:34.040 --> 07:35.680
 Okay, well, here's part of what it means.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.720
 This is a terrible thing.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.040
 So you could say that the entire Christian narrative

07:41.040 --> 07:42.760
 is embedded in that image.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.000
 Why?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.560
 Well, let's say that flaming swords are a symbol of death.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.760
 That seems pretty obvious.

07:50.760 --> 07:55.720
 Let's say further that they're a symbol of apocalypse and hell.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.560
 That doesn't seem completely unreasonable.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.880
 So here's an idea.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.760
 Not only do you have to face death,

08:04.760 --> 08:06.960
 you have to face death and hell

08:06.960 --> 08:09.120
 before you can get to paradise.

08:09.120 --> 08:13.480
 Hellish judgment and all that's embedded in that image.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.560
 And a piece of art with an image like that

08:16.560 --> 08:18.760
 has all that information in it.

08:18.760 --> 08:22.600
 And it shines forth in some fundamental sense.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.600
 It reaches into the back tendrils of your mind

08:25.600 --> 08:29.480
 at levels you can't even comprehend and grips you.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.400
 I mean, that's why people go to museums

08:31.400 --> 08:33.840
 and gaze at paintings they don't understand.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.360
 And that's why they'll pay,

08:35.360 --> 08:37.720
 what's the most expensive objects in the world?

08:37.720 --> 08:39.760
 If it's not carbon fiber racing yachts,

08:39.760 --> 08:42.920
 it's definitely classic paintings, right?

08:42.920 --> 08:45.760
 It's high level technological implements

08:45.760 --> 08:47.120
 or it's classic art.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.960
 Well, why are those things so expensive?

08:48.960 --> 08:51.880
 Why do we build temples to house the images?

08:51.880 --> 08:54.640
 Even secular people go to museums.

08:54.640 --> 08:55.800
 I'm secular.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.000
 Well, are you in a museum?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.600
 Yes, are you looking at art?

08:58.600 --> 09:03.600
 Yes, well, what makes you think you're secular then?

09:03.840 --> 09:07.480
 It's arguable that the thing many, many centuries from now

09:07.480 --> 09:09.640
 that will remain of all of human civilization

09:09.640 --> 09:13.000
 will be our art, not even the words.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.360
 Well, you know, a book has remained a very long time,

09:16.360 --> 09:17.200
 right?

09:17.200 --> 09:18.040
 The biblical writings.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.800
 Not that long, a few millennia.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.200
 That's right.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.400
 But that's in the full arc of living organisms.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.240
 Perhaps we'll not.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.400
 Well, we have images that are,

09:27.400 --> 09:30.720
 we have artistic images that are at least 50,000 years old,

09:30.720 --> 09:32.400
 right, that have survived.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.440
 And some of those are,

09:34.440 --> 09:36.800
 they're already profound in their symbolism.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.320
 But we, do you mean humans?

09:38.320 --> 09:39.480
 Yeah, we found them.

09:39.480 --> 09:43.520
 And they've lasted, they've lasted that long.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.280
 And so, and then think about Europe.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.800
 Secular people all over the world

09:49.800 --> 09:51.920
 make pilgrimages to Europe.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.400
 Well, why?

09:53.400 --> 09:56.040
 Because of the beauty, obviously.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.520
 I mean, that's self evident.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.240
 And it's partly because there are things in Europe

10:01.240 --> 10:02.080
 that are so beautiful.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.360
 They take your breath away, right?

10:03.360 --> 10:04.640
 They make your hair stand on end.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.680
 They fill you with a sense of awe.

10:06.680 --> 10:10.400
 And we need to see those things.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.520
 It's not optional.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.120
 We need to see those things.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.600
 The cathedrals was in a cathedral in Vienna

10:15.600 --> 10:17.800
 and it was terribly beautiful, you know?

10:17.800 --> 10:18.640
 Terribly beautiful.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.120
 Well, it was terribly beautiful.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.680
 Is beauty painful for you?

10:21.680 --> 10:24.360
 Is that the highest form of beauty?

10:24.360 --> 10:25.720
 It really challenges you?

10:25.720 --> 10:27.080
 Oh, definitely.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.000
 Yeah, yeah, a good analysis of the statue of David,

10:30.000 --> 10:31.440
 Michelangelo's statue says,

10:31.440 --> 10:34.040
 you could be far more than you are.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.000
 That's what that statue says.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.600
 And this cathedral, you know,

10:37.600 --> 10:41.160
 we went down into the under structure of it.

10:41.160 --> 10:46.160
 And there were three floors of bones from the plague.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.640
 And there they all are.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.160
 And then that cathedral's on top of it.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.560
 It's no joke to go visit a place like that.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.760
 No, it rattles you to the core.

10:55.760 --> 11:00.760
 And our religious systems have become propositionally dubious.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.680
 But there's no arguing with the architecture,

11:04.680 --> 11:06.680
 although modern architects like to,

11:06.680 --> 11:09.480
 with their sterility and their giant middle fingers

11:09.480 --> 11:10.840
 erected everywhere.

11:11.720 --> 11:15.960
 But beauty is a terrible pointer to God.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.680
 And you know, a secular person will say,

11:17.680 --> 11:18.840
 well, I don't believe in God.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.720
 It's like, have it your way.

11:22.720 --> 11:26.840
 You cannot move forward into the unforeseen horizon

11:26.840 --> 11:29.920
 of the future, except on faith.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.400
 And you might say, well, I have no faith.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.320
 It's like, well, good luck with the future then,

11:33.320 --> 11:36.280
 because what are you then nihilistic and hopeless

11:36.280 --> 11:37.560
 and anxiety ridden?

11:38.400 --> 11:41.120
 And if not, well, something's guiding you forward.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.620
 It's faith in something or multiple things,

11:43.620 --> 11:46.000
 which just makes you a polytheist,

11:46.000 --> 11:47.360
 which I wouldn't recommend.

11:47.360 --> 11:52.360
 Well, let me ask you one short lived biological meatbag

11:53.160 --> 11:56.760
 to another, who is God then?

11:58.160 --> 12:00.280
 Let's try to sneak up to this question,

12:00.280 --> 12:01.600
 if it's at all possible.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.040
 Is it possible to even talk about this?

12:05.040 --> 12:06.500
 Well, it better be because otherwise

12:06.500 --> 12:09.000
 there's no communicating about it, right?

12:09.000 --> 12:12.360
 It has to be something that can be brought down to earth.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.740
 Well, we might be too dumb to bring it down.

12:14.740 --> 12:16.000
 It's not just ignorant.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.720
 It's also sinful, right?

12:18.720 --> 12:20.560
 So because there's not knowing

12:20.560 --> 12:24.560
 and then there's wanting to know or refusing to know.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.640
 And so you might say, well,

12:26.640 --> 12:28.640
 could you extract God from a description

12:28.640 --> 12:30.640
 of the objective world, right?

12:30.640 --> 12:35.640
 Is God just the ultimate unity of the natural reality?

12:36.960 --> 12:39.320
 And I would say, well, in a sense,

12:39.320 --> 12:41.720
 there's some truth in that, but not exactly

12:41.720 --> 12:45.080
 because God in the highest sense is the spirit

12:45.080 --> 12:49.040
 that you must emulate in order to thrive.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.480
 How's that for a biological definition?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.440
 Spirit is a pattern.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.160
 The spirit that you must emulate in order to thrive.

12:56.160 --> 12:59.280
 So it's a kind of, in one sense,

12:59.280 --> 13:02.600
 when we say the human spirit, it's that.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.400
 It's an animating principle.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.040
 Yeah, it's a meta, it's a pattern.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.640
 And you might say, well, what's the pattern?

13:08.640 --> 13:11.360
 Okay, well, I can tell you that to some degree.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.860
 Imagine that like your grip by beauty,

13:14.860 --> 13:17.160
 you're gripped by admiration.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.000
 So, and you can just notice this.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.640
 This isn't propositional, you have to notice it.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.240
 It's like, oh, turns out I admire that person.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.160
 So what does that mean?

13:28.160 --> 13:31.920
 Well, it means I would like to be like him or her.

13:31.920 --> 13:32.960
 That's what admiration means.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.960
 It means there's something about the way they are

13:35.960 --> 13:40.120
 that compels imitation, another instinct,

13:40.120 --> 13:44.600
 or inspires respect or awe even.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.840
 Okay, what is that that grips you?

13:46.840 --> 13:49.360
 Well, I don't know.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.040
 Well, let's say, okay, fine, but it grips you.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.440
 And you want to be like that.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.240
 Kids hero worship, for example.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.600
 So do adults for that matter

13:56.600 --> 13:58.200
 unless they become entirely cynical.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.360
 I worship quite a few heroes.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.760
 Well, there you go.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.360
 Yes, well, there you go.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.160
 And there's no, that worship, that celebration

14:06.160 --> 14:08.480
 and proclivity to imitate is worship.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.160
 That's what worship means most fundamentally.

14:11.160 --> 14:15.160
 Now imagine you took the set of all admirable people

14:16.040 --> 14:18.960
 and you extracted out AI learning.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.960
 You extracted out the central features

14:20.960 --> 14:23.240
 of what constitutes admirable.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.720
 And then you did that repeatedly

14:24.720 --> 14:27.680
 until you purified it to what was most admirable.

14:29.260 --> 14:30.840
 That's as good as you're gonna get

14:32.800 --> 14:36.160
 in terms of a representation of God.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.600
 And you might say, well, I don't believe in that.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.320
 It's like, well, what do you mean?

14:40.320 --> 14:43.840
 It's not a set of propositional facts.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.560
 It's not a scientific theory

14:45.560 --> 14:47.440
 about the structure of the objective world.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.120
 And then I could say something about that too

14:49.120 --> 14:50.600
 because I've been thinking about this a lot,

14:50.600 --> 14:53.320
 especially since talking to Richard Dawkins.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.320
 It's like, okay, the postmodernist types,

14:57.320 --> 14:59.640
 going back way before Derrida and Foucault,

14:59.640 --> 15:04.320
 maybe back to Nietzsche, who I admire greatly, by the way,

15:04.320 --> 15:05.600
 says, God is dead.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.320
 It's like, okay, but Nietzsche said, God is dead

15:09.320 --> 15:11.480
 and we have killed him and we'll not find enough water

15:11.480 --> 15:12.960
 to wash away all the blood.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.160
 So that was Nietzsche.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.120
 He's no fool.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.120
 He's got a way with words.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.640
 He certainly does.

15:17.640 --> 15:21.080
 And so then you think, okay, well, we killed the transcendent.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.720
 Well, what does that mean for science?

15:24.720 --> 15:27.600
 Well, it frees it up because all that nonsense

15:27.600 --> 15:30.400
 about a deity is just the idiot superstition

15:30.400 --> 15:35.400
 that stops the scientific process from moving forward.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.280
 That's basically the new atheist claim,

15:37.280 --> 15:38.600
 something like that.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.000
 It's like, wait a second.

15:40.920 --> 15:44.480
 Do you believe in the transcendent if you're a scientist?

15:44.480 --> 15:47.880
 And the answer is, well, not only do you believe in it,

15:47.880 --> 15:49.480
 you believe in it more than anything else

15:49.480 --> 15:51.720
 because if you're a scientist,

15:51.720 --> 15:56.200
 you believe in what objects to your theory

15:56.200 --> 15:58.440
 more than you believe in your theory.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.440
 Now, we got to think that through very carefully.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.960
 So your theory describes the world

16:01.960 --> 16:04.200
 and as far as you're concerned,

16:04.200 --> 16:06.320
 your description of the world is the world.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.360
 But because you're a scientist, you think,

16:08.360 --> 16:11.320
 well, even though that's my description of the world

16:11.320 --> 16:13.000
 and that's what I believe,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.320
 there's something beyond what I believe.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.320
 And that's the object.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.600
 And so I'm going to throw my theory against the object

16:19.600 --> 16:21.040
 and see where it'll break.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.520
 And then I'm going to use the evidence of the break

16:24.520 --> 16:28.000
 as a source of new information to revitalize my theory.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.640
 So as a scientist, you have to posit the existence

16:30.640 --> 16:33.120
 of the ontological transcendent

16:33.120 --> 16:35.440
 before you can move forward at all.

16:35.440 --> 16:40.440
 But more, you have to posit that contact

16:40.560 --> 16:43.080
 with the ontological transcendent,

16:43.080 --> 16:46.400
 annoying though it is, because it upsets your apple cart,

16:46.400 --> 16:49.760
 is exactly what will in fact set you free.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.400
 So then you accept the proposition

16:51.400 --> 16:53.480
 that there is a transcendent reality

16:54.480 --> 16:58.520
 and that contact with that transcendent reality

16:58.520 --> 17:01.000
 is redemptive in the most fundamental sense

17:01.000 --> 17:01.840
 because if it wasn't,

17:01.840 --> 17:03.880
 well, why would you bother making contact with it?

17:03.880 --> 17:06.280
 Are you going to make everything worse or better?

17:06.280 --> 17:10.040
 Why does the contact with the transcendent

17:10.040 --> 17:11.800
 set you free as a scientist?

17:11.800 --> 17:13.880
 Because you assume that you assume,

17:13.880 --> 17:15.920
 I mean, freedom in the most fundamental sense.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.960
 It's like, well, freedom from want,

17:17.960 --> 17:21.040
 freedom from disease, freedom from ignorance, right?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.440
 That it informs you.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.880
 So it's the lie of science.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.440
 It is definitely that.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.760
 Yeah, it's the direction,

17:29.760 --> 17:31.480
 let's say the directionality of science.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.280
 That's a narrative direction, not a scientific direction.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.480
 And then the question is, what is the narrative?

17:36.480 --> 17:38.840
 Well, it posits a transcendent reality.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.680
 It posits that the transcendent reality is corrective.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.560
 It posits that our knowledge structures

17:43.560 --> 17:46.040
 should be regarded with humility.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.280
 It posits that you should bow down

17:48.280 --> 17:51.840
 in the face of the transcendent evidence.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.320
 And you have to take a vow.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.560
 You know this as a scientist.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.520
 You have to take a vow to follow that path

17:56.520 --> 17:57.800
 if you're going to be a real scientist.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.480
 It's like the truth, no matter what.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.240
 And that means you posit the truth as a redemptive force.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.440
 Well, what does redemptive mean?

18:06.440 --> 18:07.800
 Well, why bother with science?

18:07.800 --> 18:09.240
 Well, so people don't starve.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.320
 So people can move about more effectively.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.080
 So life can be more abundant, right?

18:13.080 --> 18:16.760
 So it's all ensconced within an underlying ethic.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.120
 So the reason I was saying that

18:19.120 --> 18:20.800
 while we were talking about belief in God,

18:20.800 --> 18:23.280
 it's like, this is a very complicated topic, right?

18:23.280 --> 18:25.080
 Do you believe in a transcendent reality?

18:25.080 --> 18:28.600
 See, okay, now let's say you buy the argument

18:28.600 --> 18:30.080
 I just made on the natural front.

18:30.080 --> 18:33.400
 You say, yeah, yeah, that's just nature.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.720
 That's not God.

18:35.800 --> 18:36.640
 And then I'd say, well,

18:36.640 --> 18:38.840
 what makes you think you know what nature is?

18:39.800 --> 18:42.000
 Like, see, the problem with that argument

18:42.000 --> 18:45.560
 is that it already presumes a materialist,

18:45.560 --> 18:47.200
 a reductionist, materialist,

18:47.200 --> 18:50.240
 objective view of what constitutes nature.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.640
 But if you're a scientist, you're gonna think,

18:52.640 --> 18:55.280
 well, in the final analysis, I don't know what nature is.

18:55.280 --> 18:58.400
 I certainly don't know its origin or destination point.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.360
 I don't know its teleology.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.840
 I'm really ignorant about nature.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.720
 And so when I say it's nothing but nature,

19:05.720 --> 19:07.400
 I shouldn't mean it's nothing

19:07.400 --> 19:10.720
 but what I understand nature to be.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.600
 So I could say, will we have a fully reductionist account

19:13.600 --> 19:16.320
 of cognitive processes?

19:16.320 --> 19:17.680
 And the answer to that is yes,

19:17.680 --> 19:19.400
 but by the time we do that,

19:19.400 --> 19:22.560
 our understanding of matter will have transformed so much

19:22.560 --> 19:24.560
 that what we think of as reductionists now

19:24.560 --> 19:28.200
 won't look anything like what we think of reductionism now.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.040
 Matter isn't dead dust.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.760
 I don't know what it is.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.280
 I have no idea what it is.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.080
 Matter is what matters.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.400
 There's a definition.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.560
 That's a very weird definition.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.560
 But the notion that we have,

19:42.560 --> 19:44.080
 you know that if you're a reductionist,

19:44.080 --> 19:45.240
 a materialist reductionist,

19:45.240 --> 19:48.800
 that you can reduce the complexity of what is

19:48.800 --> 19:52.040
 to your assumptions about the nature of matter.

19:52.040 --> 19:52.880
 That's not a scientific assumption.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.440
 Your specific limited human assumptions

19:55.440 --> 19:58.000
 of this century, of this week,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.800
 that so in some sense,

20:01.800 --> 20:06.280
 without God in this complicated big definition

20:06.280 --> 20:10.560
 we're talking about, there's no humility.

20:10.560 --> 20:15.280
 Or it's less, there's less likely to be,

20:15.280 --> 20:17.680
 or rather science can err

20:17.680 --> 20:20.880
 in taking a trajectory away from humility.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.040
 Well, without something much more powerful

20:24.040 --> 20:26.240
 than an individual human.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.880
 Yeah, well then, and we know, you know,

20:27.880 --> 20:30.560
 the Frankenstein story comes out of that instantly.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.760
 And that's a good story for the current times.

20:33.760 --> 20:37.960
 It's like, you're playing around with making new life.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.800
 You bloody, well, better make sure

20:40.800 --> 20:43.440
 you have your arrows pointed up.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.480
 And it's interesting because you said science

20:45.480 --> 20:49.920
 has an ethic to it, I think.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.360
 It's embedded in an ethic.

20:51.360 --> 20:55.800
 Well, there's a, you know, science is a big word.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.280
 And it includes a lot of disciplines

20:57.280 --> 20:58.560
 that have different traditions.

20:58.560 --> 21:02.680
 So biology, chemistry, genetics, physics,

21:03.960 --> 21:06.720
 those are very different communities.

21:06.720 --> 21:09.560
 And I think biology, especially when you get closer

21:09.560 --> 21:12.200
 and closer to medicine and to the human body

21:12.200 --> 21:14.480
 does have a very serious, first of all,

21:14.480 --> 21:16.800
 it has a history with Nazi Germany of being abused

21:16.800 --> 21:18.320
 and all those kinds of things.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.120
 But as a history of taking this stuff seriously,

21:21.120 --> 21:23.600
 what doesn't have a history of taking this stuff seriously

21:23.600 --> 21:25.680
 is robotics and artificial intelligence,

21:25.680 --> 21:29.840
 which is really interesting because you don't,

21:29.840 --> 21:31.280
 you know, you called me a scientist,

21:31.280 --> 21:34.920
 but, and I would like to wear that label proudly,

21:34.920 --> 21:37.800
 but often people don't think of computer science

21:37.800 --> 21:40.120
 as a science, but nevertheless,

21:40.120 --> 21:42.720
 it will be, I think, the science of one

21:42.720 --> 21:46.200
 of the major scientific fields of the 21st century.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.640
 And you should take that very seriously.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.560
 Oftentimes when people build robots or AI systems,

21:52.560 --> 21:57.160
 they think of them as toys to tinker with.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.000
 Oh, isn't this cool?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.440
 And I feel this too.

22:00.440 --> 22:01.280
 Isn't this cool?

22:01.280 --> 22:02.400
 It is cool.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.960
 But, you know, at a certain moment,

22:04.960 --> 22:09.360
 you might, isn't this nuclear explosion cool?

22:09.360 --> 22:10.200
 Yeah.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.040
 Because it is.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.160
 Or birth control pill, cool.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.920
 It's like, or transistor cool.

22:14.920 --> 22:16.760
 Yeah. Well, the other thing too,

22:16.760 --> 22:19.960
 and this is a weird problem in some sense,

22:19.960 --> 22:24.000
 the robotics engineer types, they're thing people, right?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
 I mean, the big classes of interest

22:26.000 --> 22:28.720
 are interest in things versus interest in people.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.720
 Some of my best friends are thing people.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.560
 Yeah, right.

22:31.560 --> 22:36.560
 And thing people are very, very clear logical thinkers

22:37.040 --> 22:41.120
 and they're very outcome oriented and practical.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.240
 Now, and that's all good.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.040
 That makes the machinery and keeps it functioning.

22:46.040 --> 22:49.360
 But there's a human side of the equation.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.520
 And you get the extreme thing, people,

22:52.520 --> 22:55.280
 and you think, yeah, well, what about the human here?

22:55.280 --> 22:58.040
 And when we're talking about,

22:58.040 --> 22:59.600
 we've been talking about the necessity

22:59.600 --> 23:01.760
 of having a technological enterprise

23:01.760 --> 23:03.400
 embedded in an ethic.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.280
 And you can ignore that, like most of the time, right?

23:06.280 --> 23:09.440
 You can ignore the overall ethic in some sense

23:09.440 --> 23:11.880
 when you're toying around with your toys.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.000
 But when you're building an artificial intelligence,

23:14.000 --> 23:18.120
 it's like, well, that's not a toy.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.480
 That might be...

23:20.480 --> 23:22.200
 A toy becomes the monster very quickly.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.840
 Yeah, yes, yes.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.920
 And this is a whole new kind of monster.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.560
 And maybe it's already here.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.040
 Yes, and you notice how many of those things

23:35.040 --> 23:36.620
 you can no longer turn off.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.400
 And what is it with you engineers

23:40.400 --> 23:43.400
 and your inability to put off switches on things now?

23:44.680 --> 23:46.880
 It's like, I have to hold this for five seconds

23:46.880 --> 23:48.960
 for it to shut off, or I can't figure it.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.800
 I just wanna shut it off, click off.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.760
 Well, what is it with you humans

23:53.760 --> 23:57.040
 that don't put off switches on other humans?

23:57.040 --> 23:59.560
 Because there's a magic to the thing that you notice,

23:59.560 --> 24:02.360
 and it hurts for both you

24:02.360 --> 24:05.960
 and perhaps one day the thing itself to turn it off.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.440
 And so you have to be very careful

24:07.440 --> 24:11.200
 as an engineer adding off switches to things.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.360
 I think it's a feature, not a bug, the off switch.

24:14.360 --> 24:17.000
 The off switch gives a deadline to us humans,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.640
 to systems of existence.

24:19.640 --> 24:23.240
 It makes you, you know, death is the thing

24:23.240 --> 24:25.800
 that really brings clarity to life.

24:25.800 --> 24:26.880
 And I do think...

24:26.880 --> 24:28.760
 Yes, hence the flaming swords.

24:28.760 --> 24:29.600
 The flaming sword.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.160
 I do like your view of the flame with the bush

24:33.160 --> 24:36.640
 and perhaps the sword as a thing of transformation.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.920
 It's also, it's a transformation

24:38.920 --> 24:41.400
 that kind of consumes the thing in the process.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.320
 Well, it depends on how much of the thing is chaff.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.240
 You know, this is why you can't touch

24:46.240 --> 24:48.680
 the Ark of the Covenant, for example.

24:48.680 --> 24:52.080
 And this is why people can have very bad psychedelic trips.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.960
 It's like if you're 95% dead wood

24:54.960 --> 24:57.200
 and you get too close to the flame,

24:57.200 --> 25:00.640
 the 5% that's left might not be able to make it.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.720
 So you think it's all chaff,

25:04.720 --> 25:07.040
 but I think there is some aspect of destruction

25:07.040 --> 25:10.920
 that is, that's, you know, the old Bukowski line

25:10.920 --> 25:13.760
 of do what you love and let it kill you.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.600
 Don't you think that destruction is part of...

25:16.600 --> 25:18.240
 That's humility.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.080
 That's humility.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.640
 You bet, you bet, you bet.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.240
 It's like, invite in the judgment.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.080
 Invite in the judgment

25:24.080 --> 25:25.600
 because maybe you can die a little bit

25:25.600 --> 25:27.080
 instead of dying completely.

25:27.080 --> 25:27.920
 You know, and that's,

25:27.920 --> 25:30.240
 I think it's Alfred North Whitehead.

25:30.240 --> 25:33.440
 We can let our ideas die instead of us, right?

25:33.440 --> 25:35.760
 We can have these partial personalities

25:35.760 --> 25:38.640
 that we can burn off and we can let them go

25:38.640 --> 25:41.520
 before they become tyrannical pharaohs and everything.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.240
 And we lose everything.

25:43.240 --> 25:46.400
 And so, yeah, there's this optimal bite of death.

25:46.400 --> 25:49.640
 And who knows what it would mean to optimize that?

25:49.640 --> 25:51.440
 Like, what if it was possible

25:51.440 --> 25:53.920
 that if you died enough all the time

25:53.920 --> 25:56.200
 that you could continue to live?

25:56.200 --> 25:58.320
 And the thing is, we already know that biologically

25:58.320 --> 26:02.480
 because if you don't die properly all the time,

26:02.480 --> 26:04.040
 well, it's cancerous outgrowths

26:04.040 --> 26:09.040
 and it's a very fine balance between productivity

26:09.640 --> 26:14.040
 on the biological front and the culling of that, right?

26:14.040 --> 26:17.640
 Life is a real balance between growth and death.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.320
 And so what would happen if you got that balance right?

26:20.320 --> 26:21.560
 Well, we kind of know, right?

26:21.560 --> 26:26.080
 Because if you live your life properly, so to speak,

26:26.080 --> 26:28.800
 and you're humble enough to let your stupidity die

26:28.800 --> 26:32.040
 before it takes you out, you will live longer.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.240
 That's just a fact.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.120
 Well, but then what's the ultimate extension of that?

26:37.120 --> 26:38.720
 And the answer is, we don't know.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.160
 We have no idea.

26:40.160 --> 26:43.040
 Well, let me ask you a difficult question because...

26:43.040 --> 26:45.640
 As opposed to the easy ones that you've been asking so far.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.880
 Well, Dostoevsky's always just the warm up.

26:50.840 --> 26:54.160
 So if death, if death every single day

26:54.160 --> 26:56.040
 is the way to progress through life,

26:56.960 --> 26:58.680
 you have become quite famous.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.160
 Death and hell.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.000
 Death and hell.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.680
 Yeah, yeah, because you don't wanna forget the hell part.

27:04.680 --> 27:08.680
 Do you worry that your fame traps you

27:08.680 --> 27:12.320
 into the person that you wore before?

27:12.320 --> 27:15.280
 Yeah, well, the Elvis became an Elvis impersonator

27:15.280 --> 27:16.520
 by the time you died.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.280
 Yeah, do you fear that you have become

27:18.280 --> 27:20.320
 a Jordan Peterson impersonator?

27:20.320 --> 27:23.120
 Do you fear of, in some part,

27:23.120 --> 27:28.120
 becoming the famous suit wearing brilliant Jordan Peter,

27:28.120 --> 27:33.120
 the certainty in the pursuit of truth, always right.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.920
 I think I worry about it more than anything else.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.920
 I hope, I hope I do, I better.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.960
 Has fame to some degree,

27:41.960 --> 27:44.360
 when you look at yourself in the mirror,

27:44.360 --> 27:47.680
 in the quiet of your mind, has it corrupted you?

27:47.680 --> 27:50.160
 No doubt, in some regard.

27:50.160 --> 27:53.280
 I mean, it's very difficult thing to avoid,

27:53.280 --> 27:57.120
 because things change around you.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.440
 People are much more likely

27:58.440 --> 28:01.840
 to do what you ask, for example, right?

28:01.840 --> 28:02.960
 And so that's a danger,

28:02.960 --> 28:06.000
 because one of the things that keeps you dying properly

28:06.000 --> 28:08.840
 is that people push back against you optimally.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.480
 This is why so many celebrities spiral out of control,

28:11.480 --> 28:15.160
 especially the tyrannical types that say run countries.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.360
 Everyone around them stops saying,

28:17.360 --> 28:20.160
 yeah, you're deviating a little bit there.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.560
 They laugh at all their jokes.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.800
 They open all their doors.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.320
 They always want something from them.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.320
 The red carpet's always rolled out.

28:27.320 --> 28:29.800
 It's like, well, you think, wouldn't that be lovely?

28:29.800 --> 28:34.040
 It's, well, not if the red carpet is rolled out to you

28:34.040 --> 28:36.280
 while you're on your way to perdition.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.840
 That's not a good deal.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.040
 You just get there more efficiently.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.680
 And so one of the things that I've tried to learn

28:42.680 --> 28:46.160
 to manage is to have people around me all the time

28:46.160 --> 28:49.320
 who are critics, who are saying,

28:49.320 --> 28:50.680
 yeah, I could have done that better

28:50.680 --> 28:52.880
 and you're a little too harsh there

28:52.880 --> 28:55.680
 and you're alienating people unnecessarily there

28:55.680 --> 28:57.960
 and you should have done some more background work there.

28:57.960 --> 29:01.520
 And I think the responsibility attendant

29:01.520 --> 29:04.800
 upon that increases as your influence increases.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.520
 And that's, as your influence increases,

29:08.520 --> 29:10.960
 then that becomes a lot of responsibility.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.840
 So, you know, and then maybe have an off day.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.280
 And well, here's an example.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.360
 I've been writing some columns lately

29:19.360 --> 29:24.280
 about things that perturbed me like the forthcoming famine,

29:24.280 --> 29:29.280
 for example, and it's hard to take those problems on.

29:31.080 --> 29:33.360
 It's difficult to take those problems on

29:33.360 --> 29:35.680
 in a serious manner and it's frightening.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.560
 And it would be easier just to go up to the cottage

29:37.560 --> 29:40.840
 with my wife and go out on the lake and watch the sunset.

29:40.840 --> 29:45.600
 And so I'm tempted to draw on anger

29:45.600 --> 29:49.200
 as a motivating energy to help me overcome

29:49.200 --> 29:52.120
 the resistance to doing this.

29:52.120 --> 29:56.040
 But then that makes me more harsh and judgmental in my tone.

29:56.040 --> 29:59.120
 When I'm reading such things, for example, on YouTube,

29:59.120 --> 30:00.320
 then might be optimal.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.360
 Now, I've had debates about with people about that

30:03.360 --> 30:05.280
 because I have friends who say,

30:05.280 --> 30:10.280
 no, if you're calling out the environmentalist globalists

30:10.560 --> 30:12.880
 who are harassing the Dutch farmers,

30:12.880 --> 30:15.840
 then a little anger is just the ticket.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.720
 But then others say, well, you know,

30:17.720 --> 30:20.240
 you don't want to be too harsh because you alienate people

30:20.240 --> 30:22.080
 who would otherwise listen to you.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.960
 It's like that's a hard balance to get right.

30:24.960 --> 30:28.480
 But also maybe anger hardens your mind

30:28.480 --> 30:31.240
 to where you don't notice the subtle quiet beauty

30:31.240 --> 30:34.600
 of the world, the quiet love that's always there

30:34.600 --> 30:36.200
 that permeates everything.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.920
 Sometimes you can become deeply cynical about the world

30:38.920 --> 30:41.880
 if it's the Nietzsche thing.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.760
 Battle not with monsters, lest you become a monster.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.440
 And if you gaze into the abyss,

30:47.440 --> 30:50.200
 the abyss gazes also into you.

30:50.200 --> 30:54.120
 Right, but I would say, bring it on.

30:54.120 --> 30:58.280
 Right, because that's why I also say,

30:58.280 --> 31:00.040
 knowing that he's absolutely right,

31:00.040 --> 31:03.440
 but if you gaze into the abyss long enough,

31:03.440 --> 31:05.400
 you see the light, not the darkness.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.360
 Are you sure about that?

31:08.360 --> 31:10.600
 I'm betting my life on it.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.200
 Yeah, that's a heck of a bet.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.040
 Well, that's...

31:13.040 --> 31:15.120
 Because it might distort your mind

31:15.120 --> 31:20.120
 to where all you see is the evil in this world.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.160
 Well, then I would say you haven't looked long enough.

31:24.160 --> 31:28.400
 You know, that's back to the swords, the flaming swords.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.080
 It's like, so I said the whole story of Christ

31:31.080 --> 31:33.280
 was prefigured in that image.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.840
 It's like the story of Christ psychologically

31:36.840 --> 31:40.880
 is radical acceptance of the worst possible tragedy.

31:40.880 --> 31:41.720
 That's what it means.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.000
 That's what the crucifix means.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.120
 Psychologically, it's like gaze upon that

31:45.120 --> 31:46.720
 which you are most afraid of.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.560
 But that story doesn't end there

31:48.560 --> 31:53.480
 because in the story, Christ goes through death into hell.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.320
 So death isn't enough.

31:55.320 --> 31:58.920
 The abyss of innocent death is not sufficient

31:58.920 --> 32:00.720
 to produce redemption.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.160
 It has to be a voluntary journey to hell.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.880
 And maybe that's true for everyone.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.800
 And that's like, there is no more terrifying idea

32:08.800 --> 32:10.320
 than that by definition.

32:10.320 --> 32:14.000
 And so then, well, do you gaze upon that?

32:14.000 --> 32:17.760
 Well, who knows?

32:17.760 --> 32:18.600
 Who knows?

32:18.600 --> 32:22.520
 How often do you gaze upon death, your own?

32:22.520 --> 32:26.120
 How often do you remember, remind yourself

32:26.120 --> 32:27.520
 that this right ends?

32:27.520 --> 32:28.360
 Personally?

32:28.360 --> 32:29.600
 Personally.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.800
 All the time.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.760
 Because you, as a deep thinker and a philosopher,

32:33.760 --> 32:36.360
 it's easy to start philosophizing

32:36.360 --> 32:40.320
 and forgetting that you might die today.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.240
 The angel of death sits on every word.

32:43.640 --> 32:44.480
 How's that?

32:45.720 --> 32:48.160
 How often do you actually consciously?

32:48.160 --> 32:49.640
 All the time.

32:49.640 --> 32:50.680
 Notice the angel.

32:50.680 --> 32:51.560
 All the time.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.760
 I think it's one of the things that made me peculiar.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.240
 When I was in graduate school,

32:59.240 --> 33:03.200
 I thought about, I had the thought of death

33:03.200 --> 33:05.200
 in my mind all the time.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.360
 And I noticed that many of the people that I was with,

33:07.360 --> 33:09.920
 these were people I admired fine.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.080
 That wasn't part of their character,

33:12.080 --> 33:13.800
 but it was definitely part of mine.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.040
 I'd wake up every morning.

33:16.040 --> 33:18.000
 This happened for years, think,

33:18.000 --> 33:19.720
 time's short, get at it.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.600
 Time's short, get at it.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.640
 There's things to do.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.600
 And so that was always, it's still there.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.880
 And it's still there with, I would say,

33:27.880 --> 33:30.040
 and it's unbearable in some sense.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.200
 Are you afraid of it?

33:31.200 --> 33:33.760
 Like what's your relationship, yeah.

33:33.760 --> 33:37.120
 You know, I was ready to die a year ago.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.440
 And not casually.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.240
 I had people I loved, you know.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.480
 So no, I'm not very worried about me,

33:49.480 --> 33:52.120
 but I'm very worried about making a mistake.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.240
 Yeah.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.560
 I heard Elon Musk talk about that a couple of months ago.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.880
 It was really a striking moment.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.120
 Someone asked him about death,

33:59.120 --> 34:00.640
 and he said just offhand day,

34:00.640 --> 34:02.080
 and then went on with the conversation.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.400
 He said, I'd be a relief.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.360
 And then he went on with the conversation.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.400
 And I thought, well, you know,

34:09.400 --> 34:11.720
 he's got a lot of weight on his shoulders.

34:11.720 --> 34:14.880
 I'm sure that part of them thinks I'd be easier

34:14.880 --> 34:18.080
 just if this wasn't here at all.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.480
 Now, he said it offhand,

34:19.480 --> 34:21.920
 but it was a telling moment in my estimation.

34:21.920 --> 34:26.080
 So for him, that's a why live question.

34:26.080 --> 34:30.200
 The exhaustion of life, if you call it life is suffering,

34:30.200 --> 34:32.240
 but the hardship.

34:32.240 --> 34:33.920
 I'm more afraid of hell than death.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.880
 You're afraid of the thing that follows.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.720
 I don't know if it follows or if it's always here.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.920
 I think we're gonna find out.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.200
 What's the connection between death and hell?

34:50.200 --> 34:51.080
 I don't know.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.560
 I don't know.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.400
 I don't know.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.160
 Is there something that needs to be done

34:57.160 --> 34:58.520
 before you arrive?

34:58.520 --> 35:00.320
 You're more likely to die terribly

35:00.320 --> 35:03.840
 if you live in a manner that brings you to hell.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.960
 That's one connection.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.720
 And terribly is a very deep kind of concept.

35:08.720 --> 35:09.560
 Okay.

35:09.560 --> 35:10.400
 Yeah, yeah.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.800
 And that's a definition, by the way.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.880
 What do you make of Elon Musk?

35:17.880 --> 35:19.560
 You've spoken about him a bit.

35:19.560 --> 35:20.400
 You met him.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.480
 I'm struck with admiration.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.560
 That's what I make of him.

35:23.560 --> 35:26.880
 And I always think of that as a primary.

35:26.880 --> 35:30.080
 Well, it's like, do you find this comedian funny?

35:30.080 --> 35:32.000
 It's like, well, I laugh at him.

35:32.000 --> 35:32.840
 You know what I mean?

35:32.840 --> 35:34.840
 It's not propositional again.

35:34.840 --> 35:39.600
 And so there are things I would like to ask Mr. Musk

35:39.600 --> 35:42.720
 about the Mars venture.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.320
 I don't know what he's up to there.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.960
 It strikes me as absurd in the most fundamental sense

35:47.960 --> 35:49.160
 because I think, well, it'd be easier

35:49.160 --> 35:52.360
 just to build an outpost in the Antarctica or in the desert.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.400
 Well, how much of the human endeavor is absurd?

35:54.400 --> 35:57.000
 Well, that's what it needs to say.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.720
 Great men are seldom credited with their stupidity.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.640
 Who the hell knows what Musk is up to?

36:01.640 --> 36:03.920
 I mean, obviously he's building rockets.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.160
 Now, he's motivated because he wants to build

36:06.160 --> 36:09.040
 a platform for life on Mars.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.300
 Is that a good idea?

36:11.680 --> 36:14.920
 Who am I to say he's building the rockets, man.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.760
 But I'd like to ask him about it.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.360
 I would like to see that conversation.

36:19.360 --> 36:24.360
 I do think that having talked to him quite a bit offline,

36:24.640 --> 36:29.320
 I think these several of his ideas like Mars,

36:29.320 --> 36:31.960
 like humans becoming a multi planetary species

36:31.960 --> 36:35.600
 could be one of the things that human civilization

36:35.600 --> 36:38.960
 looks back at as duh,

36:38.960 --> 36:41.040
 I can't believe he is one of the few people

36:41.040 --> 36:42.760
 that was really pushing this idea

36:42.760 --> 36:46.400
 because it's the obvious thing for society

36:46.400 --> 36:48.200
 for life to survive.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.600
 Yeah, well, it isn't obvious to me

36:49.600 --> 36:52.600
 that I'm in any position to evaluate Elon Musk.

36:52.600 --> 36:53.880
 Like I would like to talk to him

36:53.880 --> 36:55.480
 and find out what he's up to and why,

36:55.480 --> 36:58.680
 but I mean, he's an impossible person.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.480
 What he's done is impossible, all of it.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.600
 It's like he built an electric car that works.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.000
 Now, does it work completely

37:05.000 --> 37:07.280
 and will it replace gas cars or should it?

37:07.280 --> 37:10.720
 I don't know, but if we're gonna build electric cars,

37:10.720 --> 37:14.280
 he seems to be the best at that by a lot.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.760
 And he more or less did that, people carp about him,

37:16.760 --> 37:19.000
 but he more or less did that by himself.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.480
 I know he's very good at distributing responsibility

37:21.480 --> 37:23.280
 and all of that, but he's the spearhead.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.160
 And then that was pretty hard.

37:25.160 --> 37:28.840
 And then he built a rocket at like one tenth

37:28.840 --> 37:30.680
 the price of NASA rockets.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.440
 And then he shot his car out into space.

37:33.440 --> 37:34.920
 That's pretty hard.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.160
 And then he's building this boring company,

37:38.160 --> 37:41.240
 more or less as a, what would you call it?

37:41.240 --> 37:44.520
 It's sort of, it's this whimsical joke in some sense,

37:44.520 --> 37:46.280
 but it's not a joke.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.360
 He's amazing.

37:47.360 --> 37:51.400
 And you're a link delving into the depths of the mind.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.080
 And Starlink, it's like, go Elon,

37:54.080 --> 37:55.280
 as far as I'm concerned.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.560
 And then, you know, he puts his finger on things so oddly,

37:58.560 --> 38:01.240
 the problem is underpopulation.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.560
 It's like, I think so too.

38:02.560 --> 38:05.240
 I think it's a terrible problem that we're,

38:05.240 --> 38:09.920
 the West, for example, is no longer at replacement

38:09.920 --> 38:11.000
 with regard to birth rate.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.440
 It means we've abandoned the virgin and the child

38:13.440 --> 38:14.960
 in a most fundamental sense.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.800
 It's a bloody catastrophe and Musk, he sees it,

38:18.800 --> 38:21.080
 Clairez can be, it's like, wow.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.760
 And where everyone else is running around going,

38:22.760 --> 38:24.160
 oh, there's too many people.

38:24.160 --> 38:27.520
 It's like, nope, got that, not only.

38:27.520 --> 38:31.080
 See, I've learned that there are falsehoods and lies

38:31.080 --> 38:33.320
 and there are anti truths.

38:33.320 --> 38:36.080
 And an anti truth is something that's so preposterous

38:36.080 --> 38:39.640
 that you couldn't, you couldn't make a claim

38:39.640 --> 38:42.720
 that's more opposite to the truth.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.960
 And the claim that there are too many people

38:44.960 --> 38:46.800
 on the planet is an anti truth.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.960
 So, you know, people say, well, you have to accept limits

38:50.960 --> 38:55.960
 to growth and it's like, I have to accept the limits

38:56.360 --> 38:58.320
 that you're going to impose on me

38:58.320 --> 39:00.720
 because you're frightened of the future.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.520
 That's your theory, isn't it?

39:02.520 --> 39:03.360
 Okay.

39:04.520 --> 39:05.760
 Well, it's an idea.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.120
 It could be a right idea.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.400
 It could be a wrong idea.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.000
 I don't think anti truth.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.760
 Here, I'll tell you why it's the wrong idea, I think.

39:15.040 --> 39:18.680
 So imagine that there's an emergency, dragon.

39:18.680 --> 39:20.280
 There's a dragon.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.240
 Someone comes and says, there's a dragon.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.680
 I'm the guy to deal with it.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.160
 That's what the environmentalists say,

39:26.160 --> 39:29.640
 the radical types who push limits to growth.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.680
 Then I look at them and I think, okay,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.400
 is that dragon real or not?

39:35.400 --> 39:36.720
 That's one question.

39:36.720 --> 39:37.560
 Well, is the...

39:37.560 --> 39:39.280
 I ask that question of myself every time

39:39.280 --> 39:40.360
 when I spend time alone.

39:40.360 --> 39:43.280
 Is the apocalypse looming on the environmental front?

39:43.280 --> 39:44.120
 Yes or no.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.760
 I'll just leave that aside for the time being.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.680
 I think you can make a case both ways

39:48.680 --> 39:50.480
 for a bunch of different reasons.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.680
 And it's not a trivial concern.

39:52.680 --> 39:55.120
 And we've overfished the oceans terribly.

39:55.120 --> 39:59.400
 And there are environmental issues that are looming large.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.960
 Whether climate change is the cardinal one or not

40:01.960 --> 40:03.120
 is a whole different question,

40:03.120 --> 40:04.640
 but we won't get into that.

40:04.640 --> 40:05.920
 That's not the issue.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.160
 You're clamoring about a dragon.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.600
 Okay.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.440
 Why should I listen to you?

40:11.440 --> 40:14.320
 Well, let's see how you're reacting to the dragon.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.880
 First of all, you're scared stiff

40:15.880 --> 40:17.360
 and in a state of panic.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.520
 That might indicate you're not the man for the job.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.960
 Second, you're willing to use compulsion

40:23.960 --> 40:27.200
 to harness other people to fight the dragon for you.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.760
 So now not only are you terrified,

40:29.760 --> 40:32.080
 you're a terrified tyrant.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.440
 So then I would say, well, then you're not the Moses

40:34.440 --> 40:38.080
 that we need to lead us out of this particular exodus.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.320
 And maybe that's a neurological explanation.

40:40.320 --> 40:43.840
 It's like, if you're so afraid of what you're facing

40:43.840 --> 40:45.720
 that you're terrified into paralysis

40:45.720 --> 40:47.920
 and nihilism and that you're willing to use

40:47.920 --> 40:50.320
 tyrannical compulsion to get your way,

40:50.320 --> 40:52.960
 you are not the right leader for the time.

40:52.960 --> 40:56.520
 So then I like someone like Bjorn Lomburg or Matt Ridley

40:56.520 --> 40:57.960
 or Marion Tupi.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.440
 And they say, well, look,

40:59.440 --> 41:01.840
 we've got our environmental problems.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.160
 And maybe there's a,

41:04.160 --> 41:07.600
 you could make a case that there's a Malthusian element

41:07.600 --> 41:09.800
 in some situations,

41:09.800 --> 41:13.320
 but fundamentally the track record of the human race

41:13.320 --> 41:17.240
 is that we learn very fast and faster all the time

41:17.240 --> 41:21.840
 to do more with less and we've got this.

41:21.840 --> 41:26.680
 And I think, yes, to that idea.

41:26.680 --> 41:31.280
 And I think about it in a fundamental way.

41:31.280 --> 41:37.280
 It's like, I trust Lomburg, trust Tupi, trust Matt Ridley.

41:37.280 --> 41:38.960
 They've thought about these things deeply.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.120
 They're not just saying, oh, the environment doesn't matter.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.840
 Whatever the environment is,

41:43.840 --> 41:46.760
 you know, the environment, I don't even know what that is.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.800
 That's everything, the environment.

41:48.800 --> 41:51.840
 I'm concerned about the environments like,

41:52.840 --> 41:54.960
 which is, how is that different than saying,

41:54.960 --> 41:56.560
 I'm worried about everything?

41:56.560 --> 41:59.760
 How are those statements different semantically?

41:59.760 --> 42:01.960
 Well, yeah, the environment, it could be,

42:01.960 --> 42:04.120
 I'm worried about human society.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.720
 A lot of these complex systems are difficult to talk about

42:06.720 --> 42:08.840
 because there's so much involved for sure.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.120
 Yeah, everything.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.040
 And then these models,

42:12.040 --> 42:13.520
 because people have gone after me

42:13.520 --> 42:15.320
 because I don't buy the climate models.

42:15.320 --> 42:18.840
 Well, I think about the climate models as extended

42:18.840 --> 42:22.360
 into the economic models because the climate model is,

42:23.360 --> 42:25.280
 well, there's going to be a certain degree of heating,

42:25.280 --> 42:26.840
 let's say by 2100.

42:26.840 --> 42:30.280
 It's like, okay, some of that might be human generated.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.080
 Some of it's a consequence of warming after the ice age.

42:33.080 --> 42:35.560
 This has happened before, but fair enough,

42:35.560 --> 42:37.840
 let's take your presumption.

42:37.840 --> 42:40.040
 Although there are multiple presumptions,

42:40.040 --> 42:44.200
 and any error in your model multiplies as time extends,

42:44.200 --> 42:46.120
 but to have it your way.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.080
 Okay, now we're going to extend the climate model,

42:48.080 --> 42:50.160
 so to speak, into the economic model.

42:50.160 --> 42:53.120
 So I just did an analysis of a paper by Deloitte,

42:54.440 --> 42:57.240
 third biggest company in the US,

42:58.480 --> 43:01.320
 300,000 employees, major league consultants.

43:01.320 --> 43:03.120
 They just produced a report in May.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.800
 I wrote an article for it in the telegraph,

43:04.800 --> 43:06.520
 which I'm going to release this week

43:06.520 --> 43:08.120
 on my YouTube channel.

43:08.120 --> 43:13.120
 I said, well, if we get the climate problem under control,

43:13.520 --> 43:15.840
 economically, because that's where the models

43:15.840 --> 43:17.960
 are now being generated on the economic front,

43:17.960 --> 43:20.400
 so now we have to model the environment,

43:20.400 --> 43:23.560
 that's climate, and we have to model the economy,

43:23.560 --> 43:26.520
 and then we have to model their joint interaction,

43:26.520 --> 43:29.760
 and then we have to predict 100 years into the future,

43:29.760 --> 43:32.640
 and then we have to put a dollar value on that,

43:32.640 --> 43:35.360
 and then we have to claim that we can do that,

43:35.360 --> 43:38.760
 which we can't, and then this is our conclusion.

43:40.360 --> 43:43.840
 We're going to go through a difficult period of privation,

43:43.840 --> 43:45.720
 because if we don't accept limits to growth,

43:45.720 --> 43:47.360
 there's going to be a catastrophe,

43:47.360 --> 43:49.320
 50 years in the future thereabouts,

43:49.320 --> 43:52.080
 and so to avert that catastrophe,

43:52.080 --> 43:55.840
 we are going to make people poorer now.

43:55.840 --> 43:56.960
 How much poorer?

43:56.960 --> 43:58.840
 Well, not a lot compared to how much richer

43:58.840 --> 44:01.480
 they're going to be, but definitely,

44:01.480 --> 44:03.160
 and they say this in their own models,

44:03.160 --> 44:06.400
 definitely poorer, definitely poorer,

44:06.400 --> 44:09.960
 than they would be if we just left them the hell alone.

44:09.960 --> 44:14.240
 And so then I think, okay, poorer, eh?

44:14.240 --> 44:15.240
 Who?

44:15.240 --> 44:17.160
 Well, let's look at it biologically.

44:17.160 --> 44:22.160
 Got a hierarchy, right, of stability and security.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.080
 That's a hierarchy, or one type.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.960
 You stress a hierarchy like that, a social hierarchy,

44:28.960 --> 44:31.920
 so there's birds in an environment,

44:31.920 --> 44:33.640
 and an avian flu comes in,

44:33.640 --> 44:35.720
 and then you look at the birds in the social hierarchy,

44:35.720 --> 44:39.560
 and the low ranking birds have the worst nests,

44:39.560 --> 44:41.760
 so they're most exposed to wind and rain and sun,

44:41.760 --> 44:44.000
 and farthest from food supplies,

44:44.000 --> 44:45.320
 and most exposed to predators,

44:45.320 --> 44:46.880
 and so those birds are stressed,

44:46.880 --> 44:49.120
 which is what happens to you at the bottom of a hierarchy.

44:49.120 --> 44:52.240
 You're more stressed, because your life is more uncertain.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.080
 You're more stressed,

44:53.080 --> 44:56.280
 your immunological function is compromised because of that.

44:56.280 --> 44:59.520
 You're sacrificing the future for the present.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.720
 An avian flu comes in,

45:00.720 --> 45:02.960
 and the birds die from the bottom up.

45:02.960 --> 45:04.640
 That happens in every epidemic.

45:04.640 --> 45:08.320
 You die from the bottom up, okay?

45:08.320 --> 45:11.840
 So they say, when the aristocracy catches a cold,

45:11.840 --> 45:14.000
 the working class dies of pneumonia.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.560
 All right, so now we're gonna make people poorer.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.480
 Okay, who?

45:19.480 --> 45:20.880
 Well, we know who we make poorer

45:20.880 --> 45:23.040
 when we make people poorer.

45:23.040 --> 45:27.200
 We make those who are barely hanging on poorer,

45:27.200 --> 45:28.920
 and what does that mean?

45:28.920 --> 45:33.400
 It means they die, and so what the Deloitte consultants

45:33.400 --> 45:35.000
 are basically saying is,

45:35.000 --> 45:39.200
 well, you know, it's kind of unfortunate,

45:39.200 --> 45:41.760
 but according to our models,

45:41.760 --> 45:44.680
 a lot of poor people are gonna have to die

45:44.680 --> 45:47.360
 so that a lot more poor people don't die in the future.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.480
 It's like, okay, hold on a sec.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.120
 Which of those two things am I supposed

45:51.120 --> 45:52.840
 to regard with certainty?

45:52.840 --> 45:54.400
 The hypothetical poor people

45:54.400 --> 45:57.880
 that you're gonna hypothetically save 100 years from now,

45:57.880 --> 46:00.120
 or the actual poor people

46:00.120 --> 46:04.240
 that you are actually going to kill in the next 10 years.

46:05.200 --> 46:08.040
 Well, I'm gonna cast my law with the actual poor people

46:08.040 --> 46:09.800
 that you're actually going to kill.

46:11.200 --> 46:13.120
 And so, and then I think further,

46:13.120 --> 46:16.280
 it's like, well, okay, the Deloitte consultants,

46:16.280 --> 46:18.200
 have you actually modeled the world,

46:18.200 --> 46:20.680
 or is this a big advertising stick

46:20.680 --> 46:22.680
 designed to attract your corporate clients

46:22.680 --> 46:24.960
 with the demonstration that you're so intelligent

46:24.960 --> 46:26.120
 that you can actually model

46:26.120 --> 46:28.200
 the entire ecosystem of the world,

46:28.200 --> 46:30.160
 including the economic system

46:30.160 --> 46:32.560
 and predict it 100 years forward?

46:32.560 --> 46:34.280
 And isn't there a bit of a moral hazard

46:34.280 --> 46:36.400
 in making a claim like that?

46:36.400 --> 46:39.240
 Just like just a trifle, especially when,

46:39.240 --> 46:42.120
 so I talked to Bjorn Lomburg and Michael Leon last week,

46:42.120 --> 46:47.120
 I accepted the UN estimates of starvation this coming year.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.240
 150 million people will suffer food insecurity,

46:52.240 --> 46:56.000
 food insecurity, yeah, food insecurity.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.080
 That's the bloody buzzword, famine.

46:59.080 --> 47:03.120
 Well, Michael Leon thought 1.2 billion.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.400
 And then that it'll spiral

47:04.400 --> 47:07.520
 because he said, what happens in a famine

47:07.520 --> 47:11.040
 is that the governments go nuts, crazy.

47:11.040 --> 47:12.960
 The governments destabilize,

47:13.920 --> 47:17.480
 and then they appropriate the food from the farmers.

47:17.480 --> 47:19.800
 Then the farmers don't have any money.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.800
 Then they can't grow crops.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.360
 And I think, yeah, that's exactly what they do.

47:24.360 --> 47:26.440
 That's exactly what would happen.

47:26.440 --> 47:29.520
 And so, Bjorn told me 1.2 billion.

47:29.520 --> 47:32.040
 And then Bjorn Lomburg said the same thing.

47:32.040 --> 47:33.040
 I didn't even ask him.

47:33.040 --> 47:35.160
 He just made it as an offhand comment.

47:36.640 --> 47:37.680
 So...

47:37.680 --> 47:41.640
 Let me ask you about the famine of the 30s.

47:41.640 --> 47:43.040
 Yeah.

47:43.040 --> 47:43.880
 Do you think...

47:43.880 --> 47:44.720
 Ukraine?

47:44.720 --> 47:45.560
 In the Ukraine.

47:45.560 --> 47:46.400
 Oh, yeah.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.240
 Fun, fun, fun.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.920
 Similar, a lot of the things you mentioned

47:49.920 --> 47:52.680
 in the last few sentences kind of echo

47:52.680 --> 47:55.120
 through that part of human history.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.640
 The hole in the door.

47:56.640 --> 47:57.480
 Do you...

47:57.480 --> 47:58.320
 No one knows about.

47:59.640 --> 48:02.760
 Well, now I've just spent four weeks in Ukraine.

48:02.760 --> 48:05.280
 There's different parts of the world that still,

48:05.280 --> 48:08.840
 even if they don't know, they know.

48:08.840 --> 48:09.680
 Yeah.

48:09.680 --> 48:10.520
 Right.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.760
 If you, history runs in the blood.

48:12.760 --> 48:14.960
 The Dutch knew, in some sense,

48:14.960 --> 48:16.800
 they had a famine at the end of World War II.

48:16.800 --> 48:18.440
 And part of the reason that Dutch farmers

48:18.440 --> 48:21.320
 are so unbelievably efficient and productive

48:21.320 --> 48:23.720
 is that the Dutch swore at the end of World War II

48:23.720 --> 48:26.360
 that that was not going to happen again.

48:26.360 --> 48:29.640
 And then they had to scrape land out of the ocean

48:29.640 --> 48:31.240
 because Holland, that's quite a country.

48:31.240 --> 48:32.760
 It shouldn't even exist.

48:32.760 --> 48:35.160
 The fact that it's the world's number two exporter.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.000
 You know that?

48:36.000 --> 48:37.120
 It's the world's number two exporter

48:37.120 --> 48:39.880
 of agricultural products, Holland.

48:39.880 --> 48:43.320
 It's like, I don't think it's as big as Massachusetts.

48:43.320 --> 48:44.640
 It's this little tiny place.

48:44.640 --> 48:46.440
 It shouldn't even exist.

48:46.440 --> 48:49.360
 And they want to put, here's the plan.

48:49.360 --> 48:52.680
 Let's put 30% of the farmers out of business.

48:52.680 --> 48:55.760
 Well, the broader ecosystem of agricultural production

48:55.760 --> 48:58.440
 in Holland is 6% of their GDP.

48:58.440 --> 49:01.560
 Now, these centralizing politicians think,

49:01.560 --> 49:03.520
 tell me if I'm stupid about this.

49:04.640 --> 49:05.760
 Take an industry.

49:07.280 --> 49:12.280
 You knock it back by fiat, by 30%.

49:12.840 --> 49:15.240
 Now, it runs on like a 3% profit margin.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.440
 Now, you're going to kill 30% of it.

49:17.440 --> 49:20.560
 How are you not going to bring the whole thing down,

49:20.560 --> 49:22.880
 the whole farming ecosystem down?

49:22.880 --> 49:27.160
 How are you not going to impoverish the transport systems?

49:27.160 --> 49:30.760
 How are you not going to demolish the grocery stores?

49:30.760 --> 49:32.400
 You can't take something like that

49:32.400 --> 49:37.120
 and pair it back by fiat, by 30% and not kill it.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.400
 I can't see how you can do that.

49:39.400 --> 49:41.960
 I mean, look what we did with the COVID lockdowns.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.920
 We broke the supply chains.

49:43.920 --> 49:45.560
 Tried buying something lately?

49:45.560 --> 49:50.560
 And aren't the Chinese threatening Taiwan at the moment?

49:50.960 --> 49:52.840
 What are we going to do without chips?

49:53.840 --> 49:56.680
 So I don't know what these people are thinking.

49:56.680 --> 49:58.280
 And then I think, okay, what are they thinking?

49:58.280 --> 49:59.600
 Well, the Deloitte people are thinking,

49:59.600 --> 50:01.440
 aren't we smart and shouldn't we be hired

50:01.440 --> 50:02.880
 by our corporate employers?

50:02.880 --> 50:05.840
 It's like, okay, too bad about the poor.

50:06.760 --> 50:09.680
 What are the environmentalists thinking?

50:09.680 --> 50:11.080
 We love the planet.

50:11.080 --> 50:12.640
 It's like, do you?

50:12.640 --> 50:14.000
 We love the poor.

50:14.000 --> 50:14.840
 Do you?

50:14.840 --> 50:17.120
 Okay, let's pit the planet against the poor.

50:17.120 --> 50:18.480
 Who wins the planet?

50:18.480 --> 50:21.160
 Okay, you don't love the poor that much.

50:21.160 --> 50:24.840
 Do you love the planet or do you hate capitalism?

50:24.840 --> 50:27.240
 Let's pit those two things against each other.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.920
 Oh, well, it turns out we actually hate capitalism.

50:29.920 --> 50:31.480
 How can we tell?

50:31.480 --> 50:33.400
 Because you're willing to break it.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.600
 And you know what's going to happen.

50:34.600 --> 50:36.000
 So what's going to happen in Sri Lanka

50:36.000 --> 50:39.040
 with these 20 million people who now have nothing to eat?

50:39.040 --> 50:40.960
 Are they going to eat all the animals?

50:40.960 --> 50:42.560
 Are they going to burn all the firewood?

50:42.560 --> 50:45.760
 They're stockpiling firewood in Germany.

50:45.760 --> 50:48.400
 So is your environmental globalist utopia

50:49.320 --> 50:51.760
 going to kill the poor and destroy the planet?

50:51.760 --> 50:54.280
 And that's okay, because we'll wipe out capitalism.

50:54.280 --> 50:55.440
 It's like, okay.

50:55.440 --> 50:57.880
 Yeah, the dragon and the fear of the dragon

50:57.880 --> 51:01.080
 drives ideologies, some of which can build a better world,

51:01.080 --> 51:03.200
 some of which can destroy that world.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.520
 Now, what do you think of that theory

51:04.520 --> 51:07.440
 about trustworthiness?

51:07.440 --> 51:09.560
 If the dragon that you're facing

51:09.560 --> 51:12.040
 turns you into a terrified tyrant,

51:12.040 --> 51:14.280
 you're not the man for the job.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.560
 Is that a good theory?

51:15.560 --> 51:16.680
 It's an interesting theory.

51:16.680 --> 51:18.480
 Let me use that theory to challenge

51:18.480 --> 51:21.000
 because what does terror look like?

51:21.000 --> 51:25.440
 Let me turn the tables on you.

51:27.160 --> 51:32.160
 You are terrified, afraid, concerned

51:32.160 --> 51:39.160
 about the dragon of something we can call communism, Marxism.

51:40.160 --> 51:41.720
 Am I terrified of it?

51:41.720 --> 51:43.880
 Not terrified enough to be a tyrant?

51:43.880 --> 51:44.720
 Well, okay, okay.

51:44.720 --> 51:45.680
 Your theories had two components.

51:45.680 --> 51:46.520
 Yeah?

51:46.520 --> 51:47.840
 I'm not paralyzed.

51:47.840 --> 51:48.680
 Had a dragon.

51:48.680 --> 51:51.880
 Yeah, I'm not paralyzed and I don't want to be a tyrant.

51:51.880 --> 51:55.280
 The tyrant part, I think, is missing with you.

51:55.280 --> 51:57.400
 But you are very concerned.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.600
 The intensity of your fear of the dragon

51:59.600 --> 52:02.760
 who are very concerned, the intensity of your feeling

52:05.680 --> 52:08.400
 does not give much space,

52:08.400 --> 52:11.080
 actually, at least in your public persona,

52:11.080 --> 52:13.720
 for sitting quietly with the dragon

52:13.720 --> 52:15.240
 and sipping in a couple of beers

52:15.240 --> 52:16.680
 and thinking about this thing.

52:17.760 --> 52:20.520
 The intensity of your anger,

52:20.520 --> 52:25.040
 concern about certain things you're seeing in society,

52:25.040 --> 52:27.160
 is that going to drive you off the path

52:27.160 --> 52:29.600
 that ultimately takes us to a better world.

52:29.600 --> 52:30.920
 That's a good question.

52:30.920 --> 52:33.920
 I mean, I'm trying to get that right.

52:33.920 --> 52:36.560
 So we've kind of come to a cultural conclusion

52:36.560 --> 52:37.680
 about the Nazis.

52:38.680 --> 52:40.960
 Do you get to be angry about the Nazis?

52:40.960 --> 52:42.880
 Seems the answer to that is yes.

52:44.520 --> 52:46.520
 Well, actually, let me push back here.

52:47.880 --> 52:51.240
 I also don't trust people who are angry about the Nazis.

52:51.240 --> 52:53.280
 I mean the actual Nazis.

52:53.280 --> 52:56.720
 Well, as you know,

52:56.720 --> 52:58.440
 there's a lot of people in the world

53:00.400 --> 53:05.200
 that use actual Nazis to mean a lot of things.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.440
 One of them is very important to me.

53:07.440 --> 53:08.440
 Me, for example.

53:10.440 --> 53:13.840
 He's a Nazi, or magical super Nazi, as it turns out.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.440
 I think they actually sort of steal

53:15.440 --> 53:16.840
 man all their perspectives.

53:16.840 --> 53:19.880
 I think a lot of people that call you a Nazi mean it.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.960
 Yeah, I'm aware of that.

53:24.960 --> 53:26.520
 There's an important thing there,

53:26.520 --> 53:29.560
 because I went to the front in Ukraine,

53:29.560 --> 53:34.560
 and a lot of the people that lost their home

53:35.120 --> 53:38.480
 or there kind of that got to interact a lot

53:38.480 --> 53:40.240
 with Russian soldiers, Ukrainian people

53:40.240 --> 53:42.800
 that interacted with the Russian soldiers,

53:42.800 --> 53:46.440
 they reported that the Russian soldiers

53:46.440 --> 53:51.440
 really believe they're saving the people of Ukraine

53:53.000 --> 53:55.800
 in these local villages from the Nazis.

53:55.800 --> 53:56.720
 I understand, yeah.

53:56.720 --> 54:00.480
 So to them, it's not just that the Ukrainian government

54:00.480 --> 54:02.880
 has or Ukraine has some Nazis.

54:02.880 --> 54:06.200
 It's like, it has been the idea is that

54:06.200 --> 54:08.120
 the Nazis have taken over Ukraine

54:08.120 --> 54:09.920
 and we need to free them.

54:09.920 --> 54:11.240
 This is the belief.

54:11.240 --> 54:15.920
 So this, again, Nazi is still a dragon that lives,

54:15.920 --> 54:18.960
 and it's used by people because it's safe

54:18.960 --> 54:20.400
 to sit next to that dragon

54:20.400 --> 54:22.680
 and spread any kind of ideology you want.

54:22.680 --> 54:27.240
 So I just want to kind of say that we have agreed

54:27.240 --> 54:31.840
 on this particular dragon,

54:31.840 --> 54:34.160
 but I still don't trust anybody who uses that one.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.840
 Yeah, but we have issues with boundaries, right?

54:36.840 --> 54:38.040
 No, no, it's...

54:38.040 --> 54:40.680
 So this is a very complicated problem, right?

54:40.680 --> 54:45.400
 So René Girard believed that it was a human proclivity

54:45.400 --> 54:46.920
 to demonize the scapegoat

54:46.920 --> 54:48.400
 and then drive it out of the village.

54:48.400 --> 54:50.800
 And I've thought about that a lot.

54:50.800 --> 54:54.280
 We need a place to put Satan seriously.

54:54.280 --> 54:55.880
 This is a serious issue.

54:55.880 --> 54:58.280
 Should he be inside the village or outside?

54:58.280 --> 55:02.080
 Well, maybe he should be inside you, right?

55:02.080 --> 55:05.680
 That's the fundamental essence of the Christian doctrine.

55:05.680 --> 55:08.120
 It's like Satan is best fought

55:08.120 --> 55:10.960
 on the battleground of your soul.

55:12.560 --> 55:15.160
 And that's right.

55:16.720 --> 55:17.640
 It's right.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.680
 Can you actually put words to the kind of dragon

55:19.680 --> 55:20.520
 that you're fighting?

55:20.520 --> 55:22.440
 Is it communism?

55:22.440 --> 55:24.240
 It's the spirit of Cain.

55:24.240 --> 55:25.080
 Yeah.

55:26.440 --> 55:30.680
 Can you elaborate what the spirit of Cain is?

55:31.800 --> 55:36.200
 So after Adam and Eve are thrown out of paradise

55:36.200 --> 55:37.800
 for becoming self conscious

55:37.800 --> 55:40.200
 or when they become self conscious,

55:40.200 --> 55:41.740
 they're destined to work.

55:42.680 --> 55:44.600
 And the reason for that, as far as I can tell,

55:44.600 --> 55:47.480
 is that to become self conscious

55:47.480 --> 55:49.560
 is to become aware of the future.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.160
 And it's to become aware of death.

55:51.160 --> 55:53.440
 That certainly happens in the Adam and Eve story.

55:53.440 --> 55:56.080
 To have the scales fall from your eyes.

55:56.080 --> 55:58.360
 And then the consequence of that

55:58.360 --> 56:00.520
 is that you now have to labor

56:00.520 --> 56:03.520
 to prevent the catastrophes of the future.

56:03.520 --> 56:04.640
 That's work.

56:04.640 --> 56:06.480
 Work is sacrifice.

56:06.480 --> 56:09.020
 Sacrifice of the present to the future.

56:09.020 --> 56:12.240
 It's delay of gratification, it's maturity.

56:12.240 --> 56:15.240
 It's sacrifice to something as well

56:15.240 --> 56:17.560
 and in the spirit of something.

56:17.560 --> 56:22.560
 Okay, so now Adam and Eve have two children, Cain and Abel.

56:22.800 --> 56:25.760
 So those are the first two people in history

56:25.760 --> 56:28.160
 because the Garden of Eden doesn't count.

56:28.160 --> 56:30.120
 And they're the first two people who are born

56:30.120 --> 56:31.040
 rather than created.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.720
 So they're the first two people.

56:32.720 --> 56:33.820
 And that's a hell of a story

56:33.820 --> 56:36.760
 because it's a story of fratricidal murder

56:36.760 --> 56:40.680
 that degenerates into genocide, flood and tyranny.

56:40.680 --> 56:45.680
 So that's fun for the opening salvo of the story, let's say.

56:45.680 --> 56:48.760
 Abel and Cain both make sacrifices.

56:48.760 --> 56:52.320
 And for some reason Abel sacrifices, please God.

56:52.320 --> 56:56.160
 It's not exactly clear why and Cain's don't.

56:56.160 --> 57:00.480
 Now, there's an implication in the text

57:00.480 --> 57:03.520
 that it's because Cain's sacrifices are true,

57:03.520 --> 57:05.040
 are second rate.

57:05.040 --> 57:07.940
 God says that Abel brings the finest

57:07.940 --> 57:09.640
 to the sacrificial altar.

57:09.640 --> 57:11.320
 He doesn't say that about Cain.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.720
 So you could imagine that Cain is sacrificing away

57:13.720 --> 57:16.400
 but he's holding something in reserve.

57:16.400 --> 57:17.360
 He's not all in.

57:17.360 --> 57:19.800
 He's not bringing his best to the table.

57:19.800 --> 57:22.160
 He's not offering his best to God.

57:22.160 --> 57:25.640
 And so Abel thrives like mad.

57:25.640 --> 57:26.680
 And everyone loves him.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.720
 And he gets exactly what he needs and wants,

57:28.720 --> 57:30.920
 exactly when he needs and wants it.

57:30.920 --> 57:32.840
 He's favored of God.

57:32.840 --> 57:36.160
 And Cain is bearing this terrible burden forward

57:36.160 --> 57:40.280
 and working and his sacrifices are rejected.

57:40.280 --> 57:45.280
 So he gets resentful, really resentful.

57:45.480 --> 57:49.280
 Enough, resentful enough to call God out

57:49.280 --> 57:51.360
 and say something like,

57:51.360 --> 57:54.680
 this is quite the creation you've got going here.

57:55.640 --> 57:57.280
 I'm breaking myself in half

57:57.280 --> 58:00.160
 and nothing good's coming my way.

58:00.160 --> 58:01.480
 What the hell's up with that?

58:01.480 --> 58:04.880
 And then there's Abel, the sun shining on him every day.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.880
 How dare you?

58:06.880 --> 58:10.280
 Okay, but this is God that Cain's talking to.

58:10.280 --> 58:14.600
 And so God says what Cain least wants to hear,

58:14.600 --> 58:17.120
 which is what God usually says to people.

58:17.120 --> 58:21.000
 He says, look to your own devices.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.160
 You're not making the sacrifices you should

58:24.160 --> 58:25.400
 and you know it.

58:25.400 --> 58:27.800
 And then he says something even worse.

58:27.800 --> 58:31.800
 He says, sin crouches at your door

58:31.800 --> 58:34.580
 like a sexually aroused predatory animal.

58:34.580 --> 58:39.380
 And you've invited it in to have your way,

58:39.380 --> 58:41.580
 to have its way with you.

58:41.580 --> 58:42.940
 And so he basically says,

58:42.940 --> 58:47.620
 you have allowed your resentment to preoccupy yourself

58:47.620 --> 58:49.420
 and now you're brooding upon it

58:49.420 --> 58:52.860
 and generating something creative, new and awful

58:52.860 --> 58:55.140
 possessed by the spirit of resentment.

58:56.260 --> 58:59.460
 And that's why you're in the miserable state you're in.

58:59.460 --> 59:03.060
 So then Cain leaves, his countenance falls

59:03.060 --> 59:04.940
 as you might expect and Cain leaves.

59:04.940 --> 59:07.860
 And he's so incensed by this because God has said,

59:07.860 --> 59:11.660
 look, your problems are of your own making.

59:11.660 --> 59:13.740
 And not only that, you invited them in.

59:13.740 --> 59:16.460
 And not only that, you engaged in this creatively.

59:16.460 --> 59:18.740
 And not only that, you're blaming it on me.

59:18.740 --> 59:21.180
 And not only that, that's making you jealous of Abel,

59:21.180 --> 59:23.460
 who's your actual idol and goal.

59:23.460 --> 59:28.460
 And Cain instead of changing kills Abel, right?

59:29.460 --> 59:31.940
 And then Cain's descendants are the first people

59:31.940 --> 59:34.220
 who make weapons of war.

59:35.420 --> 59:39.340
 And so that's, okay, you wanna know what I think?

59:39.340 --> 59:41.540
 That's the eternal story of mankind.

59:42.500 --> 59:44.460
 And it's playing out right now,

59:44.460 --> 59:47.020
 except at a thousand times the rate.

59:47.020 --> 59:50.100
 Can I present to you a difficult truth?

59:52.380 --> 59:56.180
 Perhaps not a truth, but a thought I have,

59:56.180 --> 59:59.540
 that it is not always easy to know

59:59.540 --> 1:00:01.860
 which among us are the Cain.

1:00:01.860 --> 1:00:03.100
 That's for sure.

1:00:03.100 --> 1:00:08.100
 And resentment, it is possible to imagine you

1:00:10.100 --> 1:00:13.180
 as the person who has a resentment

1:00:13.180 --> 1:00:17.020
 towards a particular worldview

1:00:17.020 --> 1:00:19.060
 that you really worry about.

1:00:19.060 --> 1:00:21.740
 Yeah, well, I talked to a good friend of mine

1:00:21.740 --> 1:00:25.100
 last week about that publicly, we'll release it.

1:00:25.100 --> 1:00:27.740
 So I said, well, do I have a particular animus

1:00:27.740 --> 1:00:30.420
 against the left, let's say?

1:00:30.420 --> 1:00:33.460
 It's like, well, probably, okay, why?

1:00:33.460 --> 1:00:38.460
 Well, first of all, I'm a university professor.

1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:41.940
 It's not like the universities are threatened by the right.

1:00:41.940 --> 1:00:45.180
 They're threatened by the left, 100%.

1:00:45.180 --> 1:00:47.020
 And they're not just threatened a little bit,

1:00:47.020 --> 1:00:48.700
 they're threatened a lot.

1:00:48.700 --> 1:00:50.740
 And that threat made it impossible for me

1:00:50.740 --> 1:00:53.140
 to continue in my profession the way I was.

1:00:53.140 --> 1:00:55.580
 And it cost me my clinical practice too.

1:00:55.580 --> 1:00:58.780
 And that's not over yet because I have 10 lawsuits

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:02.260
 against me out right now from the college of psychologists

1:01:02.260 --> 1:01:05.220
 because they've allowed anyone to complain about me

1:01:05.220 --> 1:01:07.820
 anywhere in the world for any reason

1:01:07.820 --> 1:01:11.140
 and have the choice to follow that up with an investigation,

1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:14.380
 which is a punishment in and of itself and are doing so.

1:01:15.340 --> 1:01:19.420
 And then I've been tortured nearly to death multiple times

1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:21.540
 by bad actors on the left.

1:01:21.540 --> 1:01:25.380
 Now, I've had my fair share of radical right wingers

1:01:25.380 --> 1:01:27.460
 being unhappy with what I've said,

1:01:27.460 --> 1:01:32.060
 but personally, that's been the left the whole time.

1:01:32.060 --> 1:01:35.700
 Not only me, but my family put my family at risk

1:01:35.700 --> 1:01:39.500
 in a big way and constantly, like not once or twice,

1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:43.180
 because many people get canceled once or twice.

1:01:43.180 --> 1:01:46.660
 But I've been canceled like 40 times.

1:01:46.660 --> 1:01:49.700
 And I know like 200 people now who've been canceled.

1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:53.180
 And I can tell you without doubt

1:01:53.180 --> 1:01:56.180
 that it is one of the worst experiences of their life.

1:01:56.180 --> 1:01:58.940
 And that's if it only happens once.

1:01:58.940 --> 1:02:03.460
 And then I also know that the communists

1:02:03.460 --> 1:02:07.100
 killed 100 million people in the 20th century,

1:02:07.100 --> 1:02:10.860
 that the intellectuals excused them for it nonstop

1:02:10.860 --> 1:02:14.620
 and still haven't quit, that almost no one knows about it,

1:02:14.620 --> 1:02:17.260
 and that the specter of resentful Marxism

1:02:17.260 --> 1:02:19.060
 is back in full force.

1:02:19.060 --> 1:02:22.140
 And so do I have a bit of an animus against that?

1:02:22.140 --> 1:02:27.140
 Yes, does it go too far? I don't know.

1:02:27.460 --> 1:02:28.820
 I'm trying to figure that out.

1:02:28.820 --> 1:02:31.300
 The story you just told,

1:02:31.300 --> 1:02:34.580
 it seems nearly impossible for you,

1:02:34.580 --> 1:02:35.940
 an intellectual powerhouse,

1:02:35.940 --> 1:02:38.500
 not to have a tremendous amount of resentment.

1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:41.220
 Well, and this is the, so let me challenge you.

1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:42.580
 Yeah, go right ahead, man.

1:02:42.580 --> 1:02:43.660
 Let me challenge you.

1:02:43.660 --> 1:02:45.460
 Can you steal man?

1:02:46.660 --> 1:02:51.660
 The case that the prime minister of this country,

1:02:51.660 --> 1:02:55.500
 Trudeau, wants the best for this country

1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:58.860
 and actually might do good things for this country

1:02:58.860 --> 1:03:00.420
 as an intellectual challenge.

1:03:00.420 --> 1:03:04.380
 Sure, he seems to get along well with his wife.

1:03:05.460 --> 1:03:08.680
 He has some kids, there's no sexual scandals,

1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:11.780
 and he's in a position where that could easily be the case.

1:03:11.780 --> 1:03:13.420
 He seems to have done some good things

1:03:13.420 --> 1:03:15.740
 on the oceanic management front.

1:03:15.740 --> 1:03:18.060
 He's put a fair bit of Canada's oceans

1:03:18.060 --> 1:03:19.460
 into marine protected areas,

1:03:19.460 --> 1:03:21.940
 and that might be his most fundamental legacy,

1:03:21.940 --> 1:03:23.300
 if it's real.

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:24.620
 I've been trying to get information

1:03:24.620 --> 1:03:27.260
 about the actual reality of the protection,

1:03:27.260 --> 1:03:29.100
 and I haven't been able to do that,

1:03:29.100 --> 1:03:30.220
 but that's a good thing.

1:03:30.220 --> 1:03:32.140
 So sorry, the family thing is,

1:03:32.140 --> 1:03:32.980
 there's some aspect of...

1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:33.900
 He speaks to his character.

1:03:33.900 --> 1:03:34.740
 This is a character.

1:03:34.740 --> 1:03:35.980
 There is some aspect to him

1:03:35.980 --> 1:03:38.220
 that makes him a good man, in that sense.

1:03:38.220 --> 1:03:40.780
 Well, I mean, there's the evidence there.

1:03:40.780 --> 1:03:43.460
 I mean, he's not a Jeffrey Epstein profligate

1:03:43.460 --> 1:03:45.420
 on the sexual front, so that's something.

1:03:45.420 --> 1:03:48.940
 And his wife, they seem to have a real marriage,

1:03:48.940 --> 1:03:51.940
 and he has kids, so good for him.

1:03:51.940 --> 1:03:54.220
 That's a good start, by the way, for a leader.

1:03:54.220 --> 1:03:55.060
 Yeah, right.

1:03:55.060 --> 1:03:55.900
 To be a good man.

1:03:55.900 --> 1:03:58.260
 Well, then I also thought, okay, well,

1:03:58.260 --> 1:04:01.900
 after the Liberals had brought in a Harvard intellectual,

1:04:01.900 --> 1:04:04.340
 who was a Canadian, to be their last leader,

1:04:04.340 --> 1:04:07.780
 he didn't work out, and then they're flailing about

1:04:07.780 --> 1:04:09.500
 for a leader, and the Liberals in Canada

1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:14.500
 are pretty good at maintaining power and leadership,

1:04:14.940 --> 1:04:16.700
 and have been the dominant governing party

1:04:16.700 --> 1:04:18.620
 in Canada for a long time.

1:04:18.620 --> 1:04:21.980
 And so they went to Justin and said,

1:04:21.980 --> 1:04:24.740
 well, you know, it's you or a conservative,

1:04:24.740 --> 1:04:28.820
 and you can imagine that's not a positive specter

1:04:28.820 --> 1:04:32.140
 for someone who's on the left, or even a liberal,

1:04:32.140 --> 1:04:35.060
 especially, and Trudeau's quite a bit on the left.

1:04:35.060 --> 1:04:37.420
 And they said, we need you to run.

1:04:37.420 --> 1:04:39.780
 And then I thought, okay, well,

1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:41.740
 the answer to that should have been no,

1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:45.860
 because the Trudeau, Justin has no training for this,

1:04:45.860 --> 1:04:46.700
 no experience.

1:04:46.700 --> 1:04:50.220
 He's not, he's a part time drama teacher fundamentally.

1:04:50.220 --> 1:04:51.340
 He hadn't run a business.

1:04:51.340 --> 1:04:54.220
 He just didn't know enough to be prime minister.

1:04:54.220 --> 1:04:56.580
 But then I'm trying to put myself in his position.

1:04:56.580 --> 1:04:58.420
 So it's like, okay, I don't know enough,

1:04:58.420 --> 1:05:01.860
 but I'm young, and we don't want the conservatives,

1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:03.540
 and they had had a run, a 10 year run,

1:05:03.540 --> 1:05:05.340
 so maybe it was time for a new government.

1:05:05.340 --> 1:05:08.580
 I could, maybe I could grow into this man.

1:05:08.580 --> 1:05:10.940
 Maybe I could surround myself with good people,

1:05:10.940 --> 1:05:14.180
 and I could learn humbly, and I could become

1:05:14.180 --> 1:05:17.940
 the person I'm now pretending to be,

1:05:17.940 --> 1:05:20.540
 which we all have to do as we move forward, right?

1:05:20.540 --> 1:05:23.420
 And so then I thought, okay,

1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:24.900
 I think you made a mistake there,

1:05:24.900 --> 1:05:28.100
 because you ran only on your father's name,

1:05:28.100 --> 1:05:29.620
 and you didn't have the background,

1:05:29.620 --> 1:05:31.500
 but let's give the devil his due and say,

1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:33.260
 that's no problem.

1:05:33.260 --> 1:05:34.980
 Okay, so now what do you do?

1:05:34.980 --> 1:05:37.860
 Well, you get elected, and your first act is

1:05:38.740 --> 1:05:42.460
 to make the cabinet 50% women,

1:05:42.460 --> 1:05:46.100
 despite the fact that only 25% of the elected members

1:05:46.100 --> 1:05:47.580
 are female, it's like, okay,

1:05:47.580 --> 1:05:49.260
 you just halved your talent pool.

1:05:50.540 --> 1:05:53.020
 That was a really bad move for your first move.

1:05:53.020 --> 1:05:54.180
 Can I ask you about that?

1:05:54.180 --> 1:05:55.020
 Yeah.

1:05:55.020 --> 1:05:58.700
 Do you think, where does that move come from?

1:05:58.700 --> 1:06:00.500
 Deep somewhere in the heart?

1:06:00.500 --> 1:06:01.340
 No.

1:06:01.340 --> 1:06:04.980
 Or is it trying to listen to the social forces

1:06:04.980 --> 1:06:09.580
 that of the moment, and try to ride those ways

1:06:09.580 --> 1:06:10.620
 towards maybe greater, greater popularity?

1:06:10.620 --> 1:06:12.180
 You don't think it is like that by theater.

1:06:12.180 --> 1:06:13.940
 By after thinking it through.

1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:16.820
 It's like, no, you just halved your talent pool

1:06:16.820 --> 1:06:18.100
 for cabinet positions.

1:06:18.100 --> 1:06:19.100
 That's what you did.

1:06:19.100 --> 1:06:20.820
 There's enough cabinet positions.

1:06:22.180 --> 1:06:24.260
 You could argue that each of them met threshold.

1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:26.060
 It's like, there's a big difference

1:06:26.060 --> 1:06:27.940
 between threshold and excellent.

1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:31.020
 So you don't think that came from a place of compassion?

1:06:31.020 --> 1:06:32.100
 I don't care if it did.

1:06:32.100 --> 1:06:34.180
 I don't regard compassion as a virtue.

1:06:34.180 --> 1:06:36.380
 Compassion is a reflex, not a virtue.

1:06:36.380 --> 1:06:37.220
 You don't think so.

1:06:37.220 --> 1:06:39.260
 Judicious compassion is a virtue.

1:06:39.260 --> 1:06:40.820
 Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1:06:40.820 --> 1:06:44.660
 Compassion can come deep from the human heart

1:06:44.660 --> 1:06:46.140
 and the human mind, I think.

1:06:46.140 --> 1:06:48.420
 Are we talking about the same kind of compassion?

1:06:48.420 --> 1:06:49.260
 Yes.

1:06:49.260 --> 1:06:50.100
 Trying to understand the suffering before.

1:06:50.100 --> 1:06:53.020
 Treating adults like infants is not virtuous.

1:06:53.020 --> 1:06:53.860
 I see.

1:06:55.060 --> 1:06:58.100
 Well, compassion isn't treating adults like infants.

1:06:58.100 --> 1:06:59.580
 I mean, those are just terms.

1:06:59.580 --> 1:07:00.420
 Are you sure?

1:07:00.420 --> 1:07:02.340
 Okay, whatever the term is.

1:07:02.340 --> 1:07:03.780
 Maybe love is maybe the better word.

1:07:03.780 --> 1:07:05.540
 Eatable compassion is?

1:07:05.540 --> 1:07:08.540
 I mean, I suppose I'm speaking to love.

1:07:08.540 --> 1:07:11.340
 You don't think those ideas came from concern?

1:07:11.340 --> 1:07:12.620
 Love is compassion.

1:07:14.860 --> 1:07:15.700
 You don't think those...

1:07:15.700 --> 1:07:18.980
 Love is a blend of compassion and encouragement and truth.

1:07:18.980 --> 1:07:20.540
 Love is complicated, man.

1:07:20.540 --> 1:07:22.180
 Yeah, it has a lot of good things in it.

1:07:22.180 --> 1:07:24.700
 If I love you, is it compassion or encouragement

1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:25.620
 you want from me?

1:07:26.620 --> 1:07:27.460
 Yeah, the dance.

1:07:27.460 --> 1:07:30.100
 Love is definitely a dance of two humans,

1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:32.140
 ultimately, that leads to the growth of both.

1:07:32.140 --> 1:07:32.980
 Well, that's the thing.

1:07:32.980 --> 1:07:34.740
 The growth element is crucial.

1:07:34.740 --> 1:07:38.580
 Yeah, because the growth element, to foster the growth element,

1:07:38.580 --> 1:07:40.060
 that requires judgment.

1:07:41.220 --> 1:07:43.820
 Compassion and judgment, well, even,

1:07:43.820 --> 1:07:45.860
 and have been conceptualized this way forever,

1:07:45.860 --> 1:07:48.740
 two hands of God, mercy and justice.

1:07:48.740 --> 1:07:50.860
 They have to operate in tandem, right?

1:07:50.860 --> 1:07:51.860
 And mercy is,

1:07:53.780 --> 1:07:57.060
 flawed as you are, you're acceptable.

1:07:58.020 --> 1:07:59.500
 It's like, well, do you want that?

1:07:59.500 --> 1:08:02.060
 Do you want your flaws to be acceptable?

1:08:02.060 --> 1:08:03.300
 And the answer to that is no.

1:08:03.300 --> 1:08:05.180
 It's like, well, that's where the judgment comes in.

1:08:05.180 --> 1:08:07.380
 It's like, but you could be better.

1:08:07.380 --> 1:08:09.220
 You could be more than you are.

1:08:09.220 --> 1:08:10.940
 And that's the maternal and the paternal

1:08:10.940 --> 1:08:12.820
 in some fundamental sense.

1:08:12.820 --> 1:08:17.820
 And there has to be active exchange of information

1:08:18.580 --> 1:08:20.220
 between those two poles.

1:08:20.220 --> 1:08:23.220
 So even if Trudeau was motivated by compassion,

1:08:23.220 --> 1:08:27.540
 and it's like, yeah, just how loving are you, first of all?

1:08:27.540 --> 1:08:29.020
 No, it was a really bad decision.

1:08:29.020 --> 1:08:32.860
 And then he's expressed contempt for monetary policy.

1:08:32.860 --> 1:08:34.500
 I'm not interested in monetary policy.

1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:39.500
 It's like, okay, but you're a prime minister.

1:08:40.260 --> 1:08:43.860
 And he's expressed admiration for the Chinese Communist Party

1:08:43.860 --> 1:08:46.140
 because they can be very efficient

1:08:46.140 --> 1:08:48.060
 in their pursuit of environmental goals.

1:08:48.060 --> 1:08:51.540
 It's like, oh yeah, efficiency, eh?

1:08:52.460 --> 1:08:56.060
 The efficiency of the tyranny in the service of your terror.

1:08:56.980 --> 1:08:59.180
 And so, and I've watched him repeatedly

1:08:59.180 --> 1:09:00.620
 and I've listened to him a lot.

1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:02.940
 And I've tried to do that clinically

1:09:02.940 --> 1:09:05.660
 and with some degree of dispassion.

1:09:05.660 --> 1:09:09.700
 And that's hard too, because his father, Pierre,

1:09:09.700 --> 1:09:14.900
 devastated the West in 1982 with the National Energy Policy.

1:09:14.900 --> 1:09:18.020
 And Trudeau is doing exactly the same thing again.

1:09:18.020 --> 1:09:22.700
 And so as a Westerner, as well, I have an inbuilt animus

1:09:22.700 --> 1:09:26.500
 and one that's well deserved because central Canada,

1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:31.020
 especially the glittery, literati elite types in the Ottawa,

1:09:31.020 --> 1:09:36.020
 Montreal, Toronto triangle have exploited the West

1:09:38.060 --> 1:09:41.220
 and expressed contempt for the West far too much

1:09:41.220 --> 1:09:42.860
 for far too long.

1:09:42.860 --> 1:09:45.260
 And that's accelerating at the moment, for example,

1:09:45.260 --> 1:09:48.900
 with Trudeau's recent attack on the Canadian farmers.

1:09:48.900 --> 1:09:52.380
 He's an enemy of the oil and gas industry.

1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:54.740
 It's an utter and absolute bloody catastrophe.

1:09:54.740 --> 1:09:56.620
 And look what's happened in Europe,

1:09:56.620 --> 1:09:58.620
 at least in partial consequence.

1:09:58.620 --> 1:10:00.940
 And he's no friend to the farmers.

1:10:00.940 --> 1:10:04.100
 So I've tried to steal manhemp.

1:10:04.100 --> 1:10:05.940
 I try to put myself in the position

1:10:05.940 --> 1:10:08.260
 of the people that I'm criticizing.

1:10:08.260 --> 1:10:09.860
 I think he's a narcissist.

1:10:11.380 --> 1:10:14.220
 Do you think there's a degree to which power changed him?

1:10:15.180 --> 1:10:17.260
 If you're not suited for the position,

1:10:17.260 --> 1:10:18.660
 if you're not the man for the position,

1:10:18.660 --> 1:10:21.620
 you can be absolutely 100% sure

1:10:21.620 --> 1:10:22.980
 that the power will corrupt you.

1:10:22.980 --> 1:10:24.820
 How could it not?

1:10:24.820 --> 1:10:26.260
 I mean, at the least,

1:10:26.260 --> 1:10:28.900
 if you don't have the chops for the job,

1:10:28.900 --> 1:10:31.380
 you have to devalue the job to the point

1:10:31.380 --> 1:10:33.940
 where you can feel comfortable inhabiting it.

1:10:35.340 --> 1:10:37.820
 So yes, I think that it's corrupted him.

1:10:37.820 --> 1:10:39.900
 I mean, look at him doubling down.

1:10:39.900 --> 1:10:43.300
 We wear masks in flights into Canada.

1:10:43.300 --> 1:10:46.220
 We have to fill out an arrive can bureaucratic form

1:10:46.220 --> 1:10:49.100
 on our phones because a passport isn't good enough.

1:10:49.100 --> 1:10:50.580
 We can't get a passport.

1:10:50.580 --> 1:10:54.980
 What if you're 85 and you don't know how to use a smartphone?

1:10:54.980 --> 1:10:57.300
 Oh well, too bad for you.

1:10:58.140 --> 1:11:01.180
 It's like, yes, it's corrupted him.

1:11:01.180 --> 1:11:04.260
 Would you talk to him?

1:11:04.260 --> 1:11:06.020
 If you were to sit down and talk with him

1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:07.660
 and he wanted to talk,

1:11:10.540 --> 1:11:13.460
 would you and what kind of things would you talk about?

1:11:13.460 --> 1:11:14.860
 Perhaps on your podcast.

1:11:14.860 --> 1:11:17.860
 I don't think I've ever said no to talking to anyone.

1:11:17.860 --> 1:11:23.540
 So, would that be a first or would you make that conversation?

1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:25.380
 Do you believe in the power of conversation

1:11:25.380 --> 1:11:26.540
 in those kinds of contexts?

1:11:26.540 --> 1:11:29.180
 No, if he was willing to talk to me,

1:11:29.180 --> 1:11:30.900
 I'd talk because I'd like to ask him.

1:11:30.900 --> 1:11:32.740
 I have lots of things I'd like to ask him about.

1:11:32.740 --> 1:11:35.460
 I mean, I've had political types in Canada on my podcast

1:11:35.460 --> 1:11:37.020
 and tried to ask them questions.

1:11:38.020 --> 1:11:39.500
 So I'd like to know.

1:11:40.780 --> 1:11:43.420
 Maybe I've got a big part of them wrong.

1:11:43.420 --> 1:11:45.540
 And I probably do.

1:11:45.540 --> 1:11:48.980
 But my observation has been that every chance

1:11:48.980 --> 1:11:51.980
 he had to retreat from his pharaonic position,

1:11:51.980 --> 1:11:54.020
 let's say, he doubled down.

1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:59.020
 And these, our parliament is not running for the next year.

1:12:00.700 --> 1:12:02.340
 It's still zoom in.

1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:04.900
 It's still COVID lockdown parliament.

1:12:04.900 --> 1:12:10.380
 For the next year, it's already been fatally compromised,

1:12:10.380 --> 1:12:15.220
 perhaps, by the lockdowns for the last couple of years.

1:12:15.220 --> 1:12:16.940
 Couple of years.

1:12:16.940 --> 1:12:19.420
 This is parliament we're talking about.

1:12:19.420 --> 1:12:23.300
 There's a kind of paralysis,

1:12:23.300 --> 1:12:26.660
 fear driven paralysis that also in part,

1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:28.220
 some of the most brilliant people I know

1:12:28.220 --> 1:12:29.940
 are lost in this paralysis.

1:12:30.820 --> 1:12:32.380
 I don't think people have signed a word to,

1:12:32.380 --> 1:12:35.500
 but it's almost like a fear of this unknown thing

1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:36.900
 that lurks in the shadows.

1:12:36.900 --> 1:12:41.660
 And that's unfortunately that fear is leveraged by people

1:12:41.660 --> 1:12:47.100
 that who are in academic circles,

1:12:47.100 --> 1:12:48.860
 who are in faculty or students and so on,

1:12:48.860 --> 1:12:50.340
 are more in administration.

1:12:50.340 --> 1:12:52.500
 And they start to use that fear,

1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:55.260
 which makes me quite uncomfortable.

1:12:55.260 --> 1:12:59.980
 It does lend people in the positions of power

1:12:59.980 --> 1:13:02.060
 who are not good at handling that power

1:13:02.060 --> 1:13:07.060
 to become slowly, day by day, a little bit more corrupt.

1:13:07.340 --> 1:13:09.940
 I was really trying to figure out the last two weeks

1:13:09.940 --> 1:13:10.780
 thinking this through.

1:13:10.780 --> 1:13:13.820
 Like, how do you know, let's say,

1:13:13.820 --> 1:13:16.580
 someone asked me a question in the YouTube comment.

1:13:16.580 --> 1:13:19.820
 He said, why can I trust your advice

1:13:19.820 --> 1:13:21.140
 on the environmental front?

1:13:22.380 --> 1:13:24.700
 And I thought, that's a really good question.

1:13:25.620 --> 1:13:29.260
 Okay, let's see if we can figure out the principles

1:13:29.260 --> 1:13:31.260
 by which the advice would be trustworthy.

1:13:31.260 --> 1:13:34.540
 Okay, how do you know it's not trustworthy?

1:13:34.540 --> 1:13:39.540
 Well, one potential response to that would be

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:43.140
 the claims are not in accordance with the facts.

1:13:43.140 --> 1:13:44.860
 But facts are tricky things

1:13:44.860 --> 1:13:46.420
 and it depends on where you look for them.

1:13:46.420 --> 1:13:48.580
 So that's a tough one to get right

1:13:48.580 --> 1:13:51.980
 because, for example, Lomberg's fundamental critics

1:13:51.980 --> 1:13:56.140
 argue about his facts, not just his interpretation of them.

1:13:56.140 --> 1:13:58.020
 So that can't be an unhearing guide.

1:13:58.020 --> 1:14:01.780
 And so I thought, well, the facts exactly doesn't work

1:14:01.780 --> 1:14:05.300
 because when it's about everything, there's too many facts.

1:14:05.300 --> 1:14:08.860
 So then how do you determine if someone's a trustworthy guide

1:14:08.860 --> 1:14:11.460
 in the face of the apocalyptic unknown?

1:14:11.460 --> 1:14:13.420
 Because that's really the question.

1:14:13.420 --> 1:14:17.420
 And the answer is, they're not terrified tyrants.

1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:20.580
 I think that's the answer.

1:14:20.580 --> 1:14:21.540
 Now, maybe that's wrong.

1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:22.980
 If someone has a better answer.

1:14:22.980 --> 1:14:24.940
 How do you know if they're a terrified tyrant?

1:14:24.940 --> 1:14:25.780
 That's wrong.

1:14:25.780 --> 1:14:27.900
 Because they're willing to use compulsion on other people

1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:29.940
 when they could use goodwill.

1:14:29.940 --> 1:14:32.820
 Like the farmers in Canada objected.

1:14:32.820 --> 1:14:36.700
 They said, look, we have every economic reason

1:14:36.700 --> 1:14:40.820
 to use as little fertilizer as we can because it's expensive.

1:14:40.820 --> 1:14:44.940
 We have satellite maps of where we put the fertilizer.

1:14:44.940 --> 1:14:48.060
 We have cut our fertilizer use so substantially

1:14:48.060 --> 1:14:50.140
 in the last 40 years, you can't believe it.

1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:52.300
 And we grow way more food.

1:14:52.300 --> 1:14:54.860
 We're already breaking ourselves in half.

1:14:54.860 --> 1:14:57.020
 And if you know farmers, especially the ones

1:14:57.020 --> 1:14:59.940
 who still survive, you think those people don't know

1:14:59.940 --> 1:15:00.780
 what they're doing.

1:15:00.780 --> 1:15:04.580
 It's like, they're pretty damn sophisticated, man.

1:15:04.580 --> 1:15:08.820
 Like way more sophisticated than our prime minister.

1:15:08.820 --> 1:15:11.900
 And now you tell them, no, it's a 30% reduction.

1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:13.780
 And we don't care how much food you're growing.

1:15:13.780 --> 1:15:18.780
 So it's not a reduction that's dependent on amount

1:15:18.940 --> 1:15:21.780
 of food produced per unit of fertilizer used,

1:15:21.780 --> 1:15:24.580
 which would be, at least you could imagine it.

1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:27.260
 So, okay, so you're producing this much food

1:15:27.260 --> 1:15:28.820
 and you use this much fertilizer.

1:15:28.820 --> 1:15:30.740
 So you're hyper efficient.

1:15:30.740 --> 1:15:33.580
 Maybe we take the 10% of farmers who are the least efficient

1:15:33.580 --> 1:15:36.220
 in that metric, and we say to them,

1:15:36.220 --> 1:15:39.700
 you have to get as efficient as the average farmer.

1:15:39.700 --> 1:15:42.860
 And then they say, well, look, our situation's different.

1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:46.220
 We're in a more northern climb, the soils weaker.

1:15:46.220 --> 1:15:48.180
 You obviously have to bargain with that,

1:15:48.180 --> 1:15:52.200
 but at least you reward them for their productivity.

1:15:53.500 --> 1:15:56.500
 Well, it's like, well, Holland isn't gonna have beef.

1:15:56.500 --> 1:15:58.300
 Well, where are they gonna get it?

1:15:58.300 --> 1:15:59.340
 Well, you don't need it.

1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:00.860
 It's like, oh, I see, you get to tell me

1:16:00.860 --> 1:16:02.620
 what I can eat now, do you?

1:16:02.620 --> 1:16:04.540
 Really, okay.

1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:09.020
 And Holland is gonna import food from where

1:16:09.020 --> 1:16:12.640
 that's more efficient on the fertilizer front.

1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:14.700
 There's no one more efficient than Holland.

1:16:14.700 --> 1:16:16.540
 And same with Canada.

1:16:16.540 --> 1:16:20.580
 And like, isn't this gonna make food prices more expensive?

1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:24.180
 And doesn't that mean that hungry people die?

1:16:24.180 --> 1:16:25.980
 Because that is what it means.

1:16:25.980 --> 1:16:26.820
 And so.

1:16:26.820 --> 1:16:28.760
 So ultimately, poor people pay the price

1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:30.780
 of these kinds of policies.

1:16:30.780 --> 1:16:32.940
 Not known, not ultimately.

1:16:34.620 --> 1:16:35.460
 Now.

1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:36.300
 Today.

1:16:36.300 --> 1:16:37.940
 Today, that's a crucial distinction

1:16:37.940 --> 1:16:40.740
 because they say, well, ultimately, the poor will benefit.

1:16:41.980 --> 1:16:43.260
 Yeah, except the dead ones.

1:16:43.260 --> 1:16:45.020
 Yes, today.

1:16:45.020 --> 1:16:46.340
 Today, right.

1:16:46.340 --> 1:16:50.140
 It seems like the story of war, too, is a time

1:16:50.140 --> 1:16:53.660
 when the poor people suffer from the decision

1:16:53.660 --> 1:17:00.660
 made by the powerful, the rich, the political elite.

1:17:01.020 --> 1:17:03.380
 Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.

1:17:03.380 --> 1:17:04.220
 Oh, yeah.

1:17:04.220 --> 1:17:06.260
 I got into plenty of trouble about that, too.

1:17:07.260 --> 1:17:12.260
 You're just a man in a suit talking on microphones

1:17:13.980 --> 1:17:16.740
 and writing brilliant articles.

1:17:16.740 --> 1:17:20.780
 There's also people dying, fighting.

1:17:20.780 --> 1:17:21.740
 It's their land.

1:17:21.740 --> 1:17:22.660
 It's their country.

1:17:22.660 --> 1:17:23.740
 It's their history.

1:17:23.740 --> 1:17:26.460
 This is true for both Russia and Ukraine.

1:17:26.460 --> 1:17:30.220
 It's people trying to ask, they have many dragons

1:17:30.220 --> 1:17:32.540
 and they're asking themselves a question.

1:17:32.540 --> 1:17:33.700
 Who are we?

1:17:33.700 --> 1:17:35.140
 What is this?

1:17:35.140 --> 1:17:37.380
 What is the future of this nation?

1:17:37.380 --> 1:17:41.220
 We thought we are a great nation.

1:17:41.220 --> 1:17:44.220
 And I think both countries say this.

1:17:44.220 --> 1:17:49.020
 And they say, well, how do we become the great nation?

1:17:49.020 --> 1:17:50.900
 We thought we are.

1:17:50.900 --> 1:17:55.140
 And so first of all, you got in trouble.

1:17:55.140 --> 1:17:58.580
 What's the dynamics of the trouble?

1:17:58.580 --> 1:18:01.740
 And is it something you regret saying?

1:18:01.740 --> 1:18:02.660
 No, no.

1:18:02.660 --> 1:18:03.660
 I thought about it a lot.

1:18:03.660 --> 1:18:06.180
 I laid out four reasons for the war

1:18:06.180 --> 1:18:08.820
 and then I was criticized in the Atlantic

1:18:08.820 --> 1:18:12.060
 for the argument was reduced to one reason,

1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:15.300
 which was a caricature of the reason.

1:18:15.300 --> 1:18:18.300
 I gave a variety of reasons why the war happened.

1:18:18.300 --> 1:18:20.940
 Mismanagement on the part of the West

1:18:20.940 --> 1:18:23.540
 in relationship to Russia and foreign policy

1:18:23.540 --> 1:18:26.540
 over the last since the wall fell.

1:18:26.540 --> 1:18:29.100
 It's understandable because it's extremely complex.

1:18:30.220 --> 1:18:34.060
 Hyper reliance on Russia as a cardinal source

1:18:34.060 --> 1:18:35.980
 of energy provision for Europe

1:18:35.980 --> 1:18:39.660
 in the wake of idiot environmental globalist utopianism.

1:18:41.780 --> 1:18:45.660
 The expansionist tendencies of Russia

1:18:45.660 --> 1:18:48.780
 that are analogous in some sense

1:18:48.780 --> 1:18:51.260
 to the Soviet Union empire building.

1:18:51.260 --> 1:18:52.700
 And then the last one,

1:18:52.700 --> 1:18:53.980
 which is the one I got in trouble for,

1:18:53.980 --> 1:18:58.580
 which is Putin's belief or willingness

1:18:58.580 --> 1:19:01.260
 to manipulate his people into believing

1:19:01.260 --> 1:19:03.900
 that Russia is a salvific force

1:19:03.900 --> 1:19:06.900
 in the face of idiot Western wokeism.

1:19:06.900 --> 1:19:08.500
 And that's the one I got in trouble for.

1:19:08.500 --> 1:19:09.980
 It's like, well, you're justifying Putin.

1:19:09.980 --> 1:19:14.780
 It's like, it's not only the Russians

1:19:14.780 --> 1:19:17.140
 that think the West has lost its mind.

1:19:17.140 --> 1:19:19.220
 The Eastern Europeans think so too.

1:19:19.220 --> 1:19:20.180
 And do I know that?

1:19:20.180 --> 1:19:24.620
 It's like, well, I went to 15 Eastern European countries

1:19:24.620 --> 1:19:28.900
 this spring and I talked to 300 political

1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:30.780
 and cultural leaders and you might say,

1:19:30.780 --> 1:19:31.980
 well, they were all conservatives.

1:19:31.980 --> 1:19:35.300
 It's like, actually, no, they weren't.

1:19:35.300 --> 1:19:37.140
 Most of them were conservatives

1:19:37.140 --> 1:19:39.100
 because it turns out that they're more willing to talk to me.

1:19:39.100 --> 1:19:42.260
 But a good chunk of them were liberals

1:19:42.260 --> 1:19:46.060
 by any stretch of the imagination

1:19:46.060 --> 1:19:49.780
 and a fair number of them were canceled progressives.

1:19:49.780 --> 1:19:50.620
 So...

1:19:50.620 --> 1:19:54.540
 Because you're very concerned about the culture wars

1:19:54.540 --> 1:19:59.540
 that perhaps are a signal of a possible bad future

1:20:01.780 --> 1:20:04.260
 for this country and for this part of the world.

1:20:04.260 --> 1:20:06.300
 That reason stands out.

1:20:06.300 --> 1:20:11.300
 And do you sort of looking back

1:20:11.300 --> 1:20:13.900
 at four reasons think it deserves

1:20:13.900 --> 1:20:15.900
 to have a place in one of the four?

1:20:15.900 --> 1:20:17.380
 Oh, absolutely.

1:20:17.380 --> 1:20:20.060
 Because it is, you know...

1:20:20.060 --> 1:20:21.780
 Well, the four was bifurcated, eh?

1:20:21.780 --> 1:20:23.860
 Because I said, look, Putin might believe this.

1:20:23.860 --> 1:20:25.420
 And I actually think he does

1:20:25.420 --> 1:20:27.060
 because I read a bunch of Putin's speeches

1:20:27.060 --> 1:20:29.300
 and I have been reading them for 15 years.

1:20:29.300 --> 1:20:31.060
 And my sense of people generally,

1:20:31.060 --> 1:20:33.260
 and this was true of Hitler, it's like,

1:20:33.260 --> 1:20:35.180
 what did Hitler believe?

1:20:35.180 --> 1:20:37.460
 Well, did you read what he wrote?

1:20:37.460 --> 1:20:39.620
 He just did what he said he was going to do.

1:20:39.620 --> 1:20:41.980
 And you might think, well, some people are so tricky.

1:20:41.980 --> 1:20:46.740
 They have a whole body of elaborated speech

1:20:46.740 --> 1:20:49.460
 that's completely separate from their personality

1:20:49.460 --> 1:20:52.420
 and their personality is pursuing a different agenda.

1:20:52.420 --> 1:20:55.620
 And this whole body of speech is nothing but a front.

1:20:56.820 --> 1:20:59.820
 It's like, good luck finding someone that sophisticated.

1:20:59.820 --> 1:21:01.540
 First of all, if you say things long enough,

1:21:01.540 --> 1:21:02.500
 you're gonna believe them.

1:21:02.500 --> 1:21:04.380
 That's a really interesting and fascinating

1:21:04.380 --> 1:21:05.580
 and important point.

1:21:05.580 --> 1:21:09.300
 Even if you start out as a lie, as a propaganda,

1:21:09.300 --> 1:21:12.420
 I think Hitler is an example of somebody

1:21:12.420 --> 1:21:15.100
 that I think really quickly you start to believe

1:21:15.100 --> 1:21:15.940
 the propaganda.

1:21:15.940 --> 1:21:19.020
 Well, you've thought a lot about AI systems.

1:21:19.020 --> 1:21:22.580
 It's like, don't you become what you practice?

1:21:22.580 --> 1:21:24.620
 And the answer to that is, well, absolutely.

1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:26.140
 We even know the neurology.

1:21:26.140 --> 1:21:28.180
 It's like when you first formulate a concept,

1:21:28.180 --> 1:21:31.780
 huge swaths of your cortex are lit up, so to speak.

1:21:31.780 --> 1:21:33.980
 But as you practice that,

1:21:33.980 --> 1:21:36.500
 first of all, the right hemisphere stops participating.

1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:40.380
 And then the left participates less and less

1:21:40.380 --> 1:21:42.660
 until you build specialized machinery

1:21:42.660 --> 1:21:45.580
 for exactly that conceptual frame.

1:21:45.580 --> 1:21:48.820
 And then you start to see it, not just think it.

1:21:48.820 --> 1:21:52.100
 And so if you're telling the same lies over and over,

1:21:52.100 --> 1:21:53.420
 who do you think you're fooling?

1:21:53.420 --> 1:21:56.180
 Think, well, I can withstand my own lies.

1:21:56.180 --> 1:21:58.140
 Not if they're effective lies.

1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:02.140
 And if they're effective enough to fool millions of people

1:22:02.140 --> 1:22:04.180
 and then they reflect them back to you,

1:22:04.180 --> 1:22:08.220
 what makes you think you're going to be able to withstand that?

1:22:08.220 --> 1:22:09.060
 You aren't.

1:22:09.060 --> 1:22:12.700
 And so I do think Putin believes to the degree

1:22:12.700 --> 1:22:14.700
 that he believes anything.

1:22:14.700 --> 1:22:18.180
 I do believe that he thinks of himself as a bulwark

1:22:18.180 --> 1:22:23.660
 for Christendom against the degeneration of the West.

1:22:23.660 --> 1:22:26.660
 And that's that third way that Dugan and Putin

1:22:26.660 --> 1:22:29.380
 have been talking about, the philosopher Alexander Dugan

1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:31.060
 and Putin for 15 years.

1:22:31.060 --> 1:22:34.580
 Now, what that is is very amorphous.

1:22:34.580 --> 1:22:36.580
 Solzhenitsyn thought the Russians

1:22:36.580 --> 1:22:40.900
 would have to return to the incremental development

1:22:40.900 --> 1:22:45.020
 of Orthodox Christianity to escape from the communist trap.

1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:46.900
 And to some degree, that's happened in Russia

1:22:46.900 --> 1:22:49.500
 because there's been a return to Orthodox Christianity.

1:22:49.500 --> 1:22:51.820
 Now, you could say, yeah, but the Orthodox Church

1:22:51.820 --> 1:22:53.980
 has just been coopted by the state.

1:22:53.980 --> 1:22:56.020
 And I would say there's some evidence for that.

1:22:56.020 --> 1:23:01.100
 I've heard, for example, that the Metropolitan owns,

1:23:01.100 --> 1:23:04.540
 now I don't know if this is true, owns $5 billion

1:23:04.540 --> 1:23:06.340
 worth of personal property.

1:23:06.340 --> 1:23:09.100
 And I would say there's a bit of a moral hazard in that.

1:23:09.100 --> 1:23:12.900
 And it's possible that the Orthodox Church has been coopted,

1:23:12.900 --> 1:23:16.460
 but there has been somewhat of an Orthodox revival in Russia.

1:23:16.460 --> 1:23:18.620
 And I don't think that's all bad.

1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:21.540
 Now, even if Putin doesn't believe any of this,

1:23:21.540 --> 1:23:24.220
 if he's just a psychopathic manipulator,

1:23:24.220 --> 1:23:29.260
 and unfortunately, I don't think that's true.

1:23:29.260 --> 1:23:30.660
 I've read his speeches.

1:23:30.660 --> 1:23:32.460
 It doesn't look like it to me.

1:23:32.460 --> 1:23:34.780
 And he is by no means the worst Russian leader

1:23:34.780 --> 1:23:37.260
 of the last 100 years.

1:23:37.260 --> 1:23:39.380
 Well, there's quite a selection there.

1:23:39.380 --> 1:23:41.540
 There certainly is.

1:23:41.540 --> 1:23:48.660
 And I say that knowing that, even if he doesn't believe it,

1:23:48.660 --> 1:23:51.500
 he's convinced his people that it's true.

1:23:51.500 --> 1:23:57.220
 And so we're stuck with the claim in either case.

1:23:57.220 --> 1:23:59.820
 And that's the point I was trying to make in the article.

1:23:59.820 --> 1:24:05.700
 Sometimes I'm troubled by people that explain things.

1:24:05.700 --> 1:24:08.100
 And a lot of people reached out to me,

1:24:08.100 --> 1:24:11.820
 experts telling me how I should feel,

1:24:11.820 --> 1:24:14.020
 what I should think about Ukraine.

1:24:14.020 --> 1:24:18.340
 Oh, you naive Lex, you're so naive.

1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:20.340
 Here's how it really is.

1:24:20.340 --> 1:24:24.100
 But then I get to see people that lost their home.

1:24:24.100 --> 1:24:28.260
 I get to see people on the Russian side who believe there.

1:24:28.260 --> 1:24:31.500
 I genuinely think that there's some degree to which they

1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:33.460
 have love in their heart.

1:24:33.460 --> 1:24:38.860
 They see themselves as heroes saving a land from Nazis.

1:24:38.860 --> 1:24:41.380
 How else would you motivate young men to go fight?

1:24:41.380 --> 1:24:47.500
 It's just it's these humans destroying not only their homes,

1:24:47.500 --> 1:24:49.580
 but creating generational hate.

1:24:49.580 --> 1:24:52.780
 Destroying the possibility of love towards each other.

1:24:52.780 --> 1:24:54.700
 They're basically creating hate.

1:24:54.700 --> 1:24:59.540
 What I've heard a lot of is on February 24th of this year,

1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:04.260
 hate was born at a scale that region has not seen.

1:25:04.260 --> 1:25:07.820
 Hate towards not Vladimir Putin, hate towards not

1:25:07.820 --> 1:25:12.980
 the soldiers in Russia, but hate towards all Russians.

1:25:12.980 --> 1:25:15.420
 Hate that will last generations.

1:25:15.420 --> 1:25:23.860
 And then you can see just the pain there.

1:25:23.860 --> 1:25:32.300
 And then when all these experts talk about agriculture

1:25:32.300 --> 1:25:39.140
 and energy and geopolitics and maybe what you say with fighting

1:25:39.140 --> 1:25:41.300
 the ideologies of the woke and so on,

1:25:41.300 --> 1:25:46.740
 I just feel like it's missing something deep that war is not

1:25:46.740 --> 1:25:52.420
 fought about any of those things.

1:25:52.420 --> 1:25:56.860
 War started and war is averted based on human beings,

1:25:56.860 --> 1:25:57.540
 based on humanity.

1:25:57.540 --> 1:26:00.740
 Well, here's another ugly thought

1:26:00.740 --> 1:26:02.540
 since we haven't had enough so far.

1:26:05.860 --> 1:26:08.700
 We locked everything down for COVID.

1:26:08.700 --> 1:26:10.340
 How much face to face communication

1:26:10.340 --> 1:26:12.980
 was there between the West and Vladimir Putin?

1:26:12.980 --> 1:26:14.420
 How about none?

1:26:14.420 --> 1:26:16.940
 How about that was the wrong amount,

1:26:16.940 --> 1:26:19.380
 especially given that Europe was completely dependent

1:26:19.380 --> 1:26:21.140
 on Putin for its energy supplies?

1:26:21.140 --> 1:26:23.500
 Well, not completely, but you know what I mean.

1:26:23.500 --> 1:26:25.940
 Materially and significantly.

1:26:25.940 --> 1:26:28.620
 So maybe he had to go talk to him once every six months.

1:26:28.620 --> 1:26:31.700
 Maybe he's in a bit of a bubble, probably.

1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:35.380
 And not just an information bubble, how all these experts

1:26:35.380 --> 1:26:39.220
 tell me about human bubble.

1:26:39.220 --> 1:26:41.260
 Look, one of the things I've really learned,

1:26:41.260 --> 1:26:43.180
 there's a real emphasis on hospitality

1:26:43.180 --> 1:26:45.300
 in the Old Testament.

1:26:45.300 --> 1:26:46.940
 I just brought all these scholars together

1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:48.020
 to talk about exodus.

1:26:48.020 --> 1:26:50.860
 Hey, I have this security team with me.

1:26:50.860 --> 1:26:53.700
 And they're tough military guys.

1:26:53.700 --> 1:26:57.300
 But they're on board for this mission, let's say.

1:26:57.300 --> 1:26:58.620
 And so they went out of their way

1:26:58.620 --> 1:27:01.420
 to be hospitable to my academic guests.

1:27:01.420 --> 1:27:04.300
 They laid out nice platters of meat and cheese and crackers.

1:27:04.300 --> 1:27:07.260
 They spent all day preparing this house I had rented

1:27:07.260 --> 1:27:09.820
 so that we could have a hospitable time with these scholars,

1:27:09.820 --> 1:27:11.140
 most of whom I didn't know well,

1:27:11.140 --> 1:27:13.460
 but who said they would come and spend eight days

1:27:13.460 --> 1:27:15.420
 talking about this book with me.

1:27:15.420 --> 1:27:16.700
 We rented some jet skis.

1:27:16.700 --> 1:27:18.060
 We had a nice house.

1:27:18.060 --> 1:27:19.660
 We had fun.

1:27:19.660 --> 1:27:21.380
 And we got to know each other.

1:27:21.380 --> 1:27:22.820
 And we got to trust each other

1:27:22.820 --> 1:27:24.620
 because we could see that we could have some fun

1:27:24.620 --> 1:27:26.420
 and that we could let our hair down a bit.

1:27:26.420 --> 1:27:27.940
 We didn't have to be on guard.

1:27:27.940 --> 1:27:30.780
 And that made the talks way deeper.

1:27:30.780 --> 1:27:33.660
 And then we found out we couldn't get through exodus

1:27:33.660 --> 1:27:34.500
 in eight days.

1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:37.460
 So I had proposed very early on

1:27:37.460 --> 1:27:38.860
 that we're gonna double the length.

1:27:38.860 --> 1:27:41.100
 And so I pulled eight people out of their lives

1:27:41.100 --> 1:27:42.940
 for eight days.

1:27:42.940 --> 1:27:45.020
 That's not an easy thing to do.

1:27:45.020 --> 1:27:46.380
 It's also quite expensive.

1:27:46.380 --> 1:27:49.180
 And the Daily Wire Plus people picked all that up.

1:27:49.180 --> 1:27:52.020
 And they said, yes, right away.

1:27:52.020 --> 1:27:53.980
 So we'd love to do this again.

1:27:53.980 --> 1:27:55.020
 Well, why?

1:27:55.020 --> 1:27:57.540
 Well, partly because intellectually

1:27:57.540 --> 1:27:58.820
 it was unbelievably engaging.

1:27:58.820 --> 1:27:59.660
 I learned so much.

1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:01.620
 It'll take me like a year to digest it

1:28:01.620 --> 1:28:04.060
 if I can ever digest it.

1:28:04.060 --> 1:28:08.460
 And, but they had a really good time.

1:28:08.460 --> 1:28:11.060
 And so when they were offered that combination

1:28:11.060 --> 1:28:14.460
 of intellectual challenge, let's say in hospitality

1:28:14.460 --> 1:28:15.580
 it was a no brainer.

1:28:15.580 --> 1:28:17.700
 They just said, every one of them said,

1:28:17.700 --> 1:28:20.380
 if I can do it in any way, I will definitely be there.

1:28:20.380 --> 1:28:24.140
 And this, I went to Washington a bunch of times

1:28:24.140 --> 1:28:26.180
 and the culture of hospitality

1:28:26.180 --> 1:28:28.300
 has broken down in Washington.

1:28:28.300 --> 1:28:31.660
 40% of congressmen sleep in their offices.

1:28:31.660 --> 1:28:33.180
 They don't have apartments.

1:28:33.180 --> 1:28:35.180
 Their family isn't there with them.

1:28:35.180 --> 1:28:37.660
 They don't have social occasions

1:28:37.660 --> 1:28:40.500
 with their fellow Democrats or Republicans

1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:43.100
 much less across the table.

1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:46.060
 And so, and I tried to have some meetings in Washington

1:28:46.060 --> 1:28:48.500
 that were bilateral a couple of times

1:28:48.500 --> 1:28:50.540
 get young Republican congressmen

1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:52.620
 and Democrats together to talk.

1:28:52.620 --> 1:28:55.140
 And as soon as they talk, they think, oh,

1:28:55.140 --> 1:28:56.060
 it was so interesting.

1:28:56.060 --> 1:28:59.220
 Cause one of the lunches was about 15 people,

1:28:59.220 --> 1:29:01.340
 half Democrats and half Republicans.

1:29:01.340 --> 1:29:03.860
 And all I'd asked them to do was just spend three minutes

1:29:03.860 --> 1:29:06.340
 talking about why you decided to become a congressman.

1:29:06.340 --> 1:29:08.540
 Which is not a job I would take, by the way.

1:29:09.460 --> 1:29:12.940
 You spend 25 hours a week fund raising on the telephone.

1:29:12.940 --> 1:29:14.900
 Your family isn't there with you.

1:29:14.900 --> 1:29:17.740
 You have to run for re election every two years.

1:29:17.740 --> 1:29:20.700
 You're beholden to the party apparatus, right?

1:29:20.700 --> 1:29:22.620
 You're vilified constantly.

1:29:22.620 --> 1:29:25.100
 This is not, you know, people think,

1:29:25.100 --> 1:29:26.860
 well, this is a job for the privileged.

1:29:26.860 --> 1:29:29.740
 It's like, yeah, you go and run for Congress

1:29:29.740 --> 1:29:30.980
 and find out how much fun it is

1:29:30.980 --> 1:29:32.180
 to put your family on the line

1:29:32.180 --> 1:29:34.300
 and then have to beg for your job every two years.

1:29:34.300 --> 1:29:37.220
 Well, your enemies, the worst of your enemies

1:29:37.220 --> 1:29:38.460
 and the worst of your friends

1:29:38.460 --> 1:29:41.380
 are viciously hand pecking you.

1:29:41.380 --> 1:29:43.580
 And so anyways, we had them all sit around a table

1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:47.780
 and said, okay, just say why you ran for Congress.

1:29:47.780 --> 1:29:49.540
 It was so cool, especially for a Canadian

1:29:49.540 --> 1:29:51.740
 cause you Americans, you're so bloody theatrical.

1:29:51.740 --> 1:29:53.160
 It's something to watch.

1:29:54.300 --> 1:29:56.180
 It was like Mr. Smith goes to Washington

1:29:56.180 --> 1:29:57.020
 for every one of them.

1:29:57.020 --> 1:29:59.220
 It's like, well, this country's given us so much

1:29:59.220 --> 1:30:03.420
 or families have been so, we've benefited so much

1:30:03.420 --> 1:30:05.340
 from our time here.

1:30:05.340 --> 1:30:06.820
 We think this is a wonderful country.

1:30:06.820 --> 1:30:09.220
 We really felt that we should give back.

1:30:09.220 --> 1:30:10.540
 Then the next one would talk

1:30:10.540 --> 1:30:12.220
 and it was like exactly the same story.

1:30:12.220 --> 1:30:13.500
 And then it didn't matter

1:30:13.500 --> 1:30:14.780
 if they were Republican or Democrat,

1:30:14.780 --> 1:30:16.940
 you couldn't tell the difference, no one could.

1:30:16.940 --> 1:30:17.940
 And was it genuine?

1:30:17.940 --> 1:30:20.260
 It's like, well, are you genuine?

1:30:20.260 --> 1:30:23.140
 You think these people are worse than you?

1:30:23.140 --> 1:30:25.260
 First of all, they're not.

1:30:25.260 --> 1:30:27.700
 Second of all, they're probably better.

1:30:27.700 --> 1:30:30.140
 All things considered, it's not that easy

1:30:30.140 --> 1:30:31.820
 to become a congressman.

1:30:31.820 --> 1:30:34.240
 And I'm sure there's some bad apples in the bunch,

1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:37.060
 but by and large, you walk away from your meetings

1:30:37.060 --> 1:30:38.660
 with these people and you think.

1:30:41.060 --> 1:30:42.100
 Pretty impressive.

1:30:42.100 --> 1:30:44.220
 They really are giving a part of themselves

1:30:44.220 --> 1:30:45.580
 in the name of service.

1:30:45.580 --> 1:30:48.220
 Maybe over time, they become cynical

1:30:48.220 --> 1:30:52.820
 and become jaded and worn down by the whole system.

1:30:52.820 --> 1:30:54.180
 But I think a lot of it.

1:30:54.180 --> 1:30:58.300
 You can imagine that, is healed, I think.

1:30:58.300 --> 1:31:01.060
 And I don't think I'm, well, I'm in part naive,

1:31:01.060 --> 1:31:02.380
 but not fully.

1:31:02.380 --> 1:31:05.540
 A lot of it is healed through the power of conversation,

1:31:05.540 --> 1:31:08.220
 just basic social interaction.

1:31:08.220 --> 1:31:11.980
 I do think that the effects of this pandemic.

1:31:11.980 --> 1:31:13.980
 Especially by listening.

1:31:13.980 --> 1:31:15.460
 Listen, just sitting there.

1:31:15.460 --> 1:31:18.020
 And it doesn't have to be talking about the actual issue.

1:31:18.020 --> 1:31:21.660
 It's actually humor and all those kinds of things

1:31:21.660 --> 1:31:24.900
 about personal struggles, all those kinds of things

1:31:24.900 --> 1:31:28.620
 that remind you that you're all just humans.

1:31:28.620 --> 1:31:29.460
 Yeah.

1:31:29.460 --> 1:31:31.220
 Well, the great leaders that I've met,

1:31:31.220 --> 1:31:32.720
 cause I, and I've met some now,

1:31:33.940 --> 1:31:36.140
 they go listen to their constituents.

1:31:36.140 --> 1:31:37.420
 It's not a policy discussion.

1:31:37.420 --> 1:31:38.700
 It's not an ideology discussion.

1:31:38.700 --> 1:31:42.300
 They go say, okay, what's your life like

1:31:42.300 --> 1:31:43.620
 and what are your problems?

1:31:43.620 --> 1:31:45.780
 And tell me about them.

1:31:45.780 --> 1:31:47.980
 And then they listen and then they're struck by them.

1:31:47.980 --> 1:31:49.740
 And then they gather up all that misery

1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:52.300
 and they bring it to the congressional office

1:31:52.300 --> 1:31:53.220
 or to the parliament.

1:31:53.220 --> 1:31:57.660
 And they think, here's what the people are crying out for.

1:31:57.660 --> 1:32:00.620
 And the good leaders, that's a leader.

1:32:00.620 --> 1:32:02.540
 Leader listens.

1:32:02.540 --> 1:32:06.860
 So I talked to Jimmy Carr about comedy.

1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:11.860
 And he's sold out stages worldwide on a tour, being funny.

1:32:13.180 --> 1:32:14.380
 That's hard.

1:32:14.380 --> 1:32:17.460
 He said, comedy is the most, stand up comedy,

1:32:17.460 --> 1:32:20.860
 which is what I do in some real sense.

1:32:20.860 --> 1:32:23.460
 It's the thing I do that it's most akin

1:32:23.460 --> 1:32:25.780
 to what I'm doing on my book tours, I would say.

1:32:25.780 --> 1:32:27.460
 It's the closest analog.

1:32:27.460 --> 1:32:29.820
 He said, it's the most dialogical enterprise.

1:32:29.820 --> 1:32:32.380
 And I thought, well, why, what do you mean?

1:32:32.380 --> 1:32:34.220
 Cause see, it's just the monologue.

1:32:34.220 --> 1:32:36.260
 And it's a prepared monologue.

1:32:36.260 --> 1:32:39.900
 I mean, you have to interact dynamically with the audience

1:32:39.900 --> 1:32:40.980
 while you're telling your jokes

1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:42.040
 and you got to get the timing right.

1:32:42.040 --> 1:32:44.700
 But you have a body of jokes.

1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:47.180
 He said, well, here's how you prepare the jokes.

1:32:47.180 --> 1:32:49.460
 And I've been told this by other comedians.

1:32:49.460 --> 1:32:52.580
 You go to 50 clubs before you go on your tour

1:32:52.580 --> 1:32:55.260
 and you got some new material and you think it's funny.

1:32:55.260 --> 1:32:58.540
 And you go into a club and you lay out your new material

1:32:58.540 --> 1:33:00.500
 and people laugh at some of it.

1:33:01.860 --> 1:33:04.500
 And you pay attention to what they laugh at

1:33:04.500 --> 1:33:06.340
 and what they don't laugh at.

1:33:06.340 --> 1:33:09.020
 So you subject yourself to the judgment of the crowd.

1:33:09.020 --> 1:33:11.340
 And you get rid of everything that isn't funny.

1:33:11.340 --> 1:33:14.500
 And if you do that enough, even if you're not that funny,

1:33:14.500 --> 1:33:17.180
 the crowd will tell you what's funny.

1:33:17.180 --> 1:33:20.020
 So you can imagine, imagine you do 50 shows

1:33:20.020 --> 1:33:21.020
 and each is an hour long

1:33:21.020 --> 1:33:24.460
 and you collect two minutes of humor from each show.

1:33:24.460 --> 1:33:27.940
 So you throw away 90, you throw away two hours,

1:33:27.940 --> 1:33:31.800
 more than 98% of it, collect two minutes per show.

1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:34.260
 So you're not very funny at all.

1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:35.860
 You're like funny 2% of the time.

1:33:35.860 --> 1:33:38.860
 You aggregate that, man, you're a scream.

1:33:38.860 --> 1:33:42.500
 So that's what a leader does is that is what a leader does

1:33:42.500 --> 1:33:46.940
 is goes out and he aggregates the misery and the hopes.

1:33:46.940 --> 1:33:48.980
 And then I do think that's revivifying

1:33:49.940 --> 1:33:52.140
 to someone who would otherwise be cynical and jaded

1:33:52.140 --> 1:33:54.620
 because then the person can say to themselves,

1:33:54.620 --> 1:33:58.780
 despite the inadequacies of the system and my inadequacies,

1:33:58.780 --> 1:34:02.580
 I'm gathering up the misery and the hope

1:34:02.580 --> 1:34:06.540
 and I'm bringing it forward where it can be redressed.

1:34:06.540 --> 1:34:07.660
 Giving it a voice.

1:34:07.660 --> 1:34:09.420
 That's right, giving it a voice.

1:34:09.420 --> 1:34:10.900
 Can you actually take me through a day

1:34:10.900 --> 1:34:14.620
 this is fascinating through your comedy tour.

1:34:15.700 --> 1:34:19.580
 What is a day in the life of Jordan Peterson look like?

1:34:20.540 --> 1:34:22.500
 Which is this very interesting day.

1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:24.740
 Let's look at the day when you have to speak.

1:34:25.660 --> 1:34:28.460
 Preparing your mind, thinking of what you're going

1:34:28.460 --> 1:34:33.460
 to talk about, preparing yourself physically, mentally,

1:34:33.660 --> 1:34:37.260
 to interact with the crowd through the actual speaking,

1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:39.740
 how do you adjust what you're thinking through

1:34:39.740 --> 1:34:41.740
 and how do you come down from that

1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:46.540
 so you can start all again as a limited biological system?

1:34:47.940 --> 1:34:52.940
 Well, I'm usually up by seven and ready to go by 7.30 or eight.

1:34:56.740 --> 1:34:57.820
 Coffee?

1:34:57.820 --> 1:35:00.460
 No, steak and water.

1:35:00.460 --> 1:35:02.460
 How many times a day steak?

1:35:02.460 --> 1:35:03.780
 All that's all I eat.

1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:05.060
 How many times?

1:35:05.060 --> 1:35:07.220
 Three or four depending on the day.

1:35:07.220 --> 1:35:08.060
 Steak and water.

1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:10.620
 Steak and sparkling water.

1:35:10.620 --> 1:35:14.020
 Yeah, so monastic asceticism, man.

1:35:14.020 --> 1:35:17.180
 Well, I did the proper, I usually just once a day,

1:35:17.180 --> 1:35:19.580
 I did the proper Jordan Peterson last night

1:35:19.580 --> 1:35:20.780
 and just ate two steaks.

1:35:20.780 --> 1:35:21.820
 And how was that?

1:35:21.820 --> 1:35:23.300
 It was wonderful.

1:35:23.300 --> 1:35:25.340
 Yeah, well, if you have to only eat one thing,

1:35:26.460 --> 1:35:27.940
 you know, could be worse.

1:35:27.940 --> 1:35:29.820
 So anyways, I'm ready to go at eight

1:35:29.820 --> 1:35:31.300
 because we're generally moving.

1:35:32.260 --> 1:35:33.500
 What does it moving mean?

1:35:33.500 --> 1:35:34.820
 You're constantly flying.

1:35:34.820 --> 1:35:36.060
 Flying somewhere.

1:35:36.060 --> 1:35:36.900
 Okay.

1:35:36.900 --> 1:35:38.940
 You usually use private flights now

1:35:38.940 --> 1:35:41.660
 because the commercial airlines aren't reliable enough

1:35:41.660 --> 1:35:44.820
 and you cannot not make a venue, right?

1:35:44.820 --> 1:35:46.500
 So that's rule number one on a tour.

1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:48.940
 You make the show.

1:35:50.460 --> 1:35:53.500
 So everything, and then rule number two is anybody

1:35:53.500 --> 1:35:56.780
 who causes any trouble on the tour is gone

1:35:56.780 --> 1:35:59.420
 because there is zero room for error.

1:35:59.420 --> 1:36:04.420
 Now, no, there's zero room for unnecessary unaddressed error.

1:36:05.340 --> 1:36:06.620
 So there's gonna be errors.

1:36:06.620 --> 1:36:08.140
 The guys I have around me now,

1:36:09.820 --> 1:36:12.100
 if they make a mistake, they fix it right away.

1:36:12.100 --> 1:36:13.700
 So, and that's great.

1:36:13.700 --> 1:36:15.860
 There's a lot of people relying on you to be there.

1:36:15.860 --> 1:36:16.700
 So you have to be there.

1:36:16.700 --> 1:36:19.980
 Yeah, like 4,000 people typically.

1:36:19.980 --> 1:36:24.980
 So then I'm on the plane and I usually write,

1:36:26.100 --> 1:36:31.100
 or often because there's no internet on the plane

1:36:31.180 --> 1:36:32.580
 and that's a good use of time.

1:36:32.580 --> 1:36:33.820
 So I'm writing a new book.

1:36:33.820 --> 1:36:34.900
 So I write on the plane.

1:36:34.900 --> 1:36:36.300
 Typing or handwriting?

1:36:36.300 --> 1:36:38.980
 Typing, yeah, typing.

1:36:38.980 --> 1:36:43.620
 And then we land and we go to,

1:36:43.620 --> 1:36:47.380
 it's usually early afternoon by then we go to a hotel.

1:36:47.380 --> 1:36:49.700
 It's usually a nice hotel that's not corporate.

1:36:49.700 --> 1:36:51.500
 I don't really like corporate hotels.

1:36:51.500 --> 1:36:54.740
 My secretary and one of my logistics guys

1:36:54.740 --> 1:36:59.260
 has got quite good at picking kind of adventurous hotels,

1:36:59.260 --> 1:37:00.260
 boutique hotels.

1:37:00.260 --> 1:37:01.780
 They're usually in the old parts of the city,

1:37:01.780 --> 1:37:04.020
 especially in Europe, somewhere interesting.

1:37:04.020 --> 1:37:05.740
 And so we go there.

1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:08.940
 And then lunch usually.

1:37:08.940 --> 1:37:11.660
 And sometimes that's an air fryer and a steak

1:37:11.660 --> 1:37:12.500
 in the hotel room.

1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:14.500
 And I leave a trail of air fryer behind me

1:37:14.500 --> 1:37:16.020
 all across the world.

1:37:16.020 --> 1:37:20.620
 And then Tammy and I usually go out and have a walk

1:37:20.620 --> 1:37:22.580
 or something and take a look at the city.

1:37:22.580 --> 1:37:25.140
 And then I have a rest for like an hour and a half

1:37:25.140 --> 1:37:26.340
 or an hour, half an hour.

1:37:26.340 --> 1:37:27.180
 Like a nap?

1:37:27.180 --> 1:37:28.020
 Yeah, a nap.

1:37:28.020 --> 1:37:29.420
 I have to sleep for 20 minutes.

1:37:29.420 --> 1:37:30.460
 And that's about all I can sleep.

1:37:30.460 --> 1:37:31.780
 But I need to do that in the late afternoon.

1:37:31.780 --> 1:37:32.940
 That refreshes your mind.

1:37:32.940 --> 1:37:36.420
 Yeah, that wakes me up again for the evening.

1:37:36.420 --> 1:37:38.300
 And then Tam has to sleep longer.

1:37:38.300 --> 1:37:40.180
 She's still recovering from her illness.

1:37:40.180 --> 1:37:42.540
 And so she has to sleep longer in the afternoon.

1:37:42.540 --> 1:37:44.420
 And that's absolutely necessary for both of us

1:37:44.420 --> 1:37:46.620
 or things start to get frayed.

1:37:46.620 --> 1:37:50.140
 And so then we go to the venue.

1:37:50.140 --> 1:37:55.620
 And then I usually sit for an hour if I'm going to lecture.

1:37:55.620 --> 1:37:57.900
 I've been doing a lot of Q&As, and that's a little easier.

1:37:57.900 --> 1:38:01.140
 But if I'm going to lecture, I have to sit for an hour.

1:38:01.140 --> 1:38:05.940
 And then I think, OK, what question

1:38:05.940 --> 1:38:07.660
 am I trying to investigate?

1:38:07.660 --> 1:38:08.460
 I have to have that.

1:38:08.460 --> 1:38:09.740
 So that's the point.

1:38:09.740 --> 1:38:13.140
 What mystery am I trying to unravel?

1:38:13.140 --> 1:38:15.620
 It's usually associated with one of the rules in my book,

1:38:15.620 --> 1:38:17.700
 because technically it's a book tour.

1:38:17.700 --> 1:38:21.740
 But each of those rules is an investigation into an ethic.

1:38:21.740 --> 1:38:24.580
 And each of them points to a deeper sort of mystery

1:38:24.580 --> 1:38:25.300
 in some sense.

1:38:25.300 --> 1:38:28.860
 And there's no end to the amount that can be explored.

1:38:28.860 --> 1:38:30.860
 And so I have the question.

1:38:30.860 --> 1:38:36.060
 My question might be something like put your house

1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:39.260
 in perfect order before you criticize the world.

1:38:39.260 --> 1:38:40.740
 What does that mean exactly?

1:38:40.740 --> 1:38:42.260
 What does house mean?

1:38:42.260 --> 1:38:46.740
 What does put mean, that active verb?

1:38:46.740 --> 1:38:48.900
 What does perfect and order mean?

1:38:48.900 --> 1:38:51.300
 Why before you criticize the world?

1:38:51.300 --> 1:38:52.860
 What does it mean to criticize?

1:38:52.860 --> 1:38:54.660
 What does it mean to criticize the world?

1:38:54.660 --> 1:38:56.820
 How can you do that properly or improperly?

1:38:56.820 --> 1:38:59.300
 So I start to think about how to decompose the question.

1:38:59.300 --> 1:39:02.140
 And you start to think which of these decompositions

1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:03.780
 are important to really dig into.

1:39:03.780 --> 1:39:04.020
 Yeah.

1:39:04.020 --> 1:39:05.060
 Well, then they'll strike me.

1:39:05.060 --> 1:39:06.380
 It's like, OK, there's something there

1:39:06.380 --> 1:39:09.580
 that I've been maybe noodling around on that I would

1:39:09.580 --> 1:39:11.100
 like to investigate further.

1:39:11.100 --> 1:39:13.700
 Then I think, OK, how can I approach this problem?

1:39:13.700 --> 1:39:16.180
 I think, well, I have this story that I know.

1:39:16.180 --> 1:39:17.900
 I have this story and I have this story.

1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:19.900
 But I haven't juxtaposed them before.

1:39:19.900 --> 1:39:21.900
 And there's going to be some interesting interaction

1:39:21.900 --> 1:39:23.420
 in the juxtaposition.

1:39:23.420 --> 1:39:24.780
 So I have the question.

1:39:24.780 --> 1:39:27.500
 And I kind of have a framework of interpretation.

1:39:27.500 --> 1:39:31.060
 And then I have some potential narrative places I can go.

1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:35.100
 And then I think, OK, I can go juggle that and see what happens.

1:39:35.100 --> 1:39:38.820
 And so then what I want to do is concentrate on that process

1:39:38.820 --> 1:39:40.860
 while attending to the audience to make sure

1:39:40.860 --> 1:39:42.580
 that the words are landing.

1:39:42.580 --> 1:39:45.020
 And then see if I can delve into it deeply enough

1:39:45.020 --> 1:39:50.580
 so that a narrative emerges spontaneously with an ending.

1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:53.660
 Now, I'm sure you've experienced this in podcasts, right?

1:39:53.660 --> 1:39:54.380
 Maybe I'm wrong.

1:39:54.380 --> 1:39:58.460
 But my experience has been, if I fall into the conversation

1:39:58.460 --> 1:40:00.820
 and we know about the time frame,

1:40:00.820 --> 1:40:03.660
 there'll be a natural narrative arc.

1:40:03.660 --> 1:40:05.860
 And then so you'll kind of know when the midpoint is.

1:40:05.860 --> 1:40:08.060
 And you'll kind of see when you're reaching a conclusion.

1:40:08.060 --> 1:40:09.660
 And then if you really pay attention,

1:40:09.660 --> 1:40:12.980
 you can see that's a good place to stop.

1:40:12.980 --> 1:40:15.380
 And it's kind of you come to a point.

1:40:15.380 --> 1:40:20.260
 And you have to be alert and patient to see that.

1:40:20.260 --> 1:40:22.940
 And you have to be willing to be satisfied with where

1:40:22.940 --> 1:40:24.140
 you've got to.

1:40:24.140 --> 1:40:25.740
 But if you do that, and then it's

1:40:25.740 --> 1:40:28.740
 like a comedian making the punchline work.

1:40:28.740 --> 1:40:32.260
 It's like, I've got all these balls in the air.

1:40:32.260 --> 1:40:33.820
 And they're going somewhere.

1:40:33.820 --> 1:40:36.380
 And this is how they come together.

1:40:36.380 --> 1:40:37.700
 And people love that, right?

1:40:37.700 --> 1:40:40.140
 To say, oh, this and this and this and this and this.

1:40:40.140 --> 1:40:42.660
 Whack together.

1:40:42.660 --> 1:40:43.660
 And that's an insight.

1:40:43.660 --> 1:40:45.980
 And it is very much like a punchline.

1:40:45.980 --> 1:40:48.500
 Well, that's interesting because your mind actually,

1:40:48.500 --> 1:40:49.900
 I'm a fan of your podcast too.

1:40:49.900 --> 1:40:53.380
 And you are always driving towards that.

1:40:53.380 --> 1:40:57.060
 I would say for me in a podcast conversation,

1:40:57.060 --> 1:41:00.900
 there's often a kind of Alice in Wonderland type

1:41:00.900 --> 1:41:02.260
 of exploration.

1:41:02.260 --> 1:41:03.540
 Down the rabbit hole, man.

1:41:03.540 --> 1:41:06.220
 And then you just, and you think pops up,

1:41:06.220 --> 1:41:08.820
 the more absurd, the wilder, the better.

1:41:08.820 --> 1:41:10.860
 Conversations with Elon are like this.

1:41:10.860 --> 1:41:14.180
 It's like, actually, the more you drive towards an arc,

1:41:14.180 --> 1:41:16.300
 the more uncomfortable you start to get

1:41:16.300 --> 1:41:18.780
 in a fun, absurd conversation.

1:41:18.780 --> 1:41:22.420
 Because, oh, I'm now one of the normies.

1:41:22.420 --> 1:41:23.460
 No, I don't want that.

1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:25.700
 I want to be, I want the rabbit.

1:41:25.700 --> 1:41:27.380
 I want the crazy.

1:41:27.380 --> 1:41:29.740
 Because it makes it more fun.

1:41:29.740 --> 1:41:33.980
 But somehow throughout it, there is wisdom.

1:41:33.980 --> 1:41:37.500
 You try to grasp that such that there is a thread.

1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:38.580
 Well, that's the thing, man.

1:41:38.580 --> 1:41:40.340
 You're following the thread, eh?

1:41:40.340 --> 1:41:41.180
 Yeah.

1:41:41.180 --> 1:41:42.020
 The thread.

1:41:42.020 --> 1:41:42.980
 Well, that's right.

1:41:42.980 --> 1:41:44.260
 That's what we're trying to do.

1:41:44.260 --> 1:41:45.500
 That thread.

1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:47.220
 That thread is the proper balance

1:41:47.220 --> 1:41:49.100
 between structure and spontaneity.

1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.180
 And it manifests itself as the instinct of meaning.

1:41:52.180 --> 1:41:54.740
 And that's the logos in the dialogos.

1:41:54.740 --> 1:41:55.980
 And it really is the logos.

1:41:55.980 --> 1:41:57.740
 And God only knows what that means.

1:41:58.620 --> 1:42:00.380
 You know, I mean, the biblical claim

1:42:00.380 --> 1:42:03.740
 is that logos is the fundamental principle of reality.

1:42:03.740 --> 1:42:05.700
 And I think that's true.

1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:07.900
 I actually think that's true.

1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:10.580
 Because I think that that meaning that guides you,

1:42:10.580 --> 1:42:11.820
 well, here's a way of thinking about it.

1:42:11.820 --> 1:42:14.220
 I've been writing about this recently.

1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:17.060
 What's real matter?

1:42:17.060 --> 1:42:19.220
 It's like, okay, that's one answer.

1:42:19.220 --> 1:42:20.100
 What's real?

1:42:20.100 --> 1:42:23.140
 What matters is real.

1:42:23.140 --> 1:42:24.940
 Because that's how you act.

1:42:24.940 --> 1:42:26.740
 Okay, so that's different than matter.

1:42:27.820 --> 1:42:31.660
 It's like, okay, what's the most real of what matters?

1:42:32.820 --> 1:42:33.780
 How about pain?

1:42:34.660 --> 1:42:36.420
 Why is it the most real?

1:42:36.420 --> 1:42:38.020
 Try arguing it away.

1:42:39.300 --> 1:42:40.140
 Good luck.

1:42:41.100 --> 1:42:43.980
 So pain is the fundamental reality.

1:42:43.980 --> 1:42:44.820
 All right.

1:42:45.860 --> 1:42:47.740
 Well, that's rough.

1:42:47.740 --> 1:42:50.180
 Doesn't that lead to nihilism and hopelessness?

1:42:51.220 --> 1:42:53.860
 Yeah, doesn't it lead to a philosophy

1:42:53.860 --> 1:42:55.820
 that's antithetical towards being

1:42:55.820 --> 1:42:58.740
 the most fundamental reality is pain?

1:42:58.740 --> 1:42:59.820
 Yes.

1:42:59.820 --> 1:43:01.980
 Is there anything more fundamental than pain?

1:43:03.700 --> 1:43:04.540
 Love.

1:43:06.580 --> 1:43:07.420
 Really?

1:43:08.380 --> 1:43:09.460
 If you're in pain,

1:43:13.820 --> 1:43:14.940
 love and truth.

1:43:14.940 --> 1:43:16.380
 Love.

1:43:16.380 --> 1:43:18.220
 That's what you got.

1:43:18.220 --> 1:43:19.060
 And you know,

1:43:24.140 --> 1:43:26.780
 if they're more powerful than pain,

1:43:26.780 --> 1:43:28.620
 maybe they're the most real things.

1:43:31.660 --> 1:43:33.660
 When you think about reality, what is real?

1:43:33.660 --> 1:43:36.180
 That is the most real thing.

1:43:36.180 --> 1:43:37.540
 Well, it's a tough one, right?

1:43:37.540 --> 1:43:39.140
 Because you have to,

1:43:39.140 --> 1:43:41.100
 because if you're a scientist, a materialist,

1:43:41.100 --> 1:43:45.020
 think, well, the matter is the most real.

1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:47.540
 It's like, well, you don't know what the matter is.

1:43:47.540 --> 1:43:48.380
 Yeah.

1:43:48.380 --> 1:43:49.780
 And so, and then when push comes to shove,

1:43:49.780 --> 1:43:53.100
 and it will, you'll find out what's most real.

1:43:53.100 --> 1:43:54.940
 Yeah.

1:43:54.940 --> 1:43:59.260
 I feel like this is missing.

1:43:59.260 --> 1:44:03.540
 The physical reality is missing some of the things.

1:44:03.540 --> 1:44:06.020
 So of course, pain has a biological component

1:44:06.020 --> 1:44:06.900
 and all those kinds of things,

1:44:06.900 --> 1:44:08.780
 but it's missing something deep

1:44:08.780 --> 1:44:12.780
 about the human condition that at least the modern science

1:44:12.780 --> 1:44:15.260
 is not able to describe.

1:44:15.260 --> 1:44:17.300
 But it is reaching towards that.

1:44:17.300 --> 1:44:18.140
 Yeah, it is.

1:44:18.140 --> 1:44:22.060
 The reason, one way to describe it as you're describing

1:44:22.060 --> 1:44:23.740
 is the reason it's reaching it

1:44:23.740 --> 1:44:27.420
 is because underneath of science is this assumption

1:44:27.420 --> 1:44:32.420
 that there's a deep logos thing

1:44:32.420 --> 1:44:34.820
 to this whole thing we're trying to do.

1:44:34.820 --> 1:44:36.620
 Well, you know, there's two traditions, right?

1:44:36.620 --> 1:44:39.580
 In some sense, there's two logos traditions.

1:44:39.580 --> 1:44:44.340
 There's the Greek rational enlightenment tradition.

1:44:44.340 --> 1:44:45.900
 That's a logos tradition.

1:44:45.900 --> 1:44:48.500
 And it insists that there's a logos in nature

1:44:48.500 --> 1:44:50.700
 and that science is the way to approach it.

1:44:50.700 --> 1:44:52.580
 And then there's the Judeo Christian logos,

1:44:52.580 --> 1:44:55.140
 which is more embodied and more spiritual.

1:44:55.140 --> 1:44:57.180
 And I would say the West is actually an attempt

1:44:57.180 --> 1:44:59.060
 to unite those two.

1:44:59.060 --> 1:45:01.660
 And it's the proper attempt to unite those two

1:45:02.620 --> 1:45:04.900
 because they need to be united.

1:45:04.900 --> 1:45:07.540
 And I see the union coming in your terms.

1:45:07.540 --> 1:45:09.740
 You know, I talked to friends to wall, for example,

1:45:09.740 --> 1:45:13.420
 about the animating principle of chimpanzee sovereignty.

1:45:13.420 --> 1:45:15.300
 And that's pretty close biologically.

1:45:15.300 --> 1:45:16.860
 Is it power?

1:45:16.860 --> 1:45:19.420
 Because that's the claim even from the biologists often.

1:45:19.420 --> 1:45:23.700
 The most dominant chimp has the best reproductive success.

1:45:23.700 --> 1:45:26.860
 It's like, oh yeah, dominant, eh?

1:45:26.860 --> 1:45:28.380
 You mean using compulsion?

1:45:28.380 --> 1:45:29.980
 Okay, let's look.

1:45:29.980 --> 1:45:34.660
 Are the chimps who use compulsion the most successful?

1:45:34.660 --> 1:45:39.100
 And the answer is sporadically and rarely.

1:45:39.100 --> 1:45:41.460
 And for short, well, that's sporadically,

1:45:41.460 --> 1:45:43.020
 for short periods of time.

1:45:43.020 --> 1:45:44.060
 Why?

1:45:44.060 --> 1:45:46.700
 Because they meet an unpleasant end.

1:45:47.780 --> 1:45:52.420
 The subordinates over whom they exercise arbitrary control,

1:45:52.420 --> 1:45:56.940
 wait for a weak moment and then tear them into shreds, right?

1:45:56.940 --> 1:45:59.340
 Every dictator's terror.

1:45:59.340 --> 1:46:00.500
 And for good reason.

1:46:00.500 --> 1:46:04.460
 And DeWall has showed that the alpha chimps, the males,

1:46:04.460 --> 1:46:07.340
 who do have preferential mating access often,

1:46:07.340 --> 1:46:12.060
 are often and reliably the best peacemakers

1:46:12.060 --> 1:46:14.140
 and the most reciprocal.

1:46:14.140 --> 1:46:16.620
 And so even among chimps, the principle of sovereignty

1:46:16.620 --> 1:46:21.620
 is something like iterative, iterated reciprocity.

1:46:23.020 --> 1:46:26.860
 And that's a way better principle than power.

1:46:26.860 --> 1:46:28.740
 And it's something like, I've been thinking,

1:46:28.740 --> 1:46:31.620
 what's the antithesis of the spirit of power?

1:46:31.620 --> 1:46:35.340
 I think it's the spirit of play.

1:46:35.340 --> 1:46:37.460
 And you know, I don't know what you think about that,

1:46:37.460 --> 1:46:39.620
 but when you have a good podcast conversation,

1:46:39.620 --> 1:46:41.900
 you already described it in some sense as play.

1:46:41.900 --> 1:46:43.380
 It's like there's a structure, right?

1:46:43.380 --> 1:46:45.940
 Because it's an ordered conversation.

1:46:45.940 --> 1:46:48.180
 But you want there to be play in the system.

1:46:48.180 --> 1:46:51.380
 And if you get that right, then it's really engaging.

1:46:51.380 --> 1:46:54.860
 And then it seems to have its own narrative arc.

1:46:54.860 --> 1:46:56.780
 I'm not trying to impose that even on,

1:46:56.780 --> 1:46:58.140
 that's another thing I don't do.

1:46:58.140 --> 1:47:00.860
 I didn't come to this conversation at all,

1:47:00.860 --> 1:47:03.260
 thinking, here's what I want out of a conversation

1:47:03.260 --> 1:47:04.620
 with Lex Friedman.

1:47:04.620 --> 1:47:08.900
 Like instrumentally, I thought, I'll go talk to Lex.

1:47:08.900 --> 1:47:09.740
 Why?

1:47:10.900 --> 1:47:13.180
 I like his podcasts.

1:47:13.180 --> 1:47:14.540
 He's doing something right.

1:47:14.540 --> 1:47:15.860
 I don't know what it is.

1:47:15.860 --> 1:47:17.980
 He asks interesting questions.

1:47:17.980 --> 1:47:19.820
 I'll go have a conversation with him.

1:47:19.820 --> 1:47:20.940
 Where's it gonna go?

1:47:22.220 --> 1:47:23.500
 Wherever it goes.

1:47:24.460 --> 1:47:26.380
 Embracing the spirit of play.

1:47:26.380 --> 1:47:30.060
 So you have this, when you're lecturing,

1:47:30.060 --> 1:47:32.100
 you're going in front of the crowd.

1:47:32.100 --> 1:47:33.740
 You're thought of a question.

1:47:34.940 --> 1:47:36.420
 You get on the stage.

1:47:36.420 --> 1:47:38.340
 First of all, are you nervous at all?

1:47:39.620 --> 1:47:43.060
 I'm very nervous when I'm sitting down,

1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:46.060
 thinking through the structure initially,

1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:49.060
 which is why my wife and I have been doing Q and As.

1:47:49.060 --> 1:47:50.180
 And that's easier on me.

1:47:50.180 --> 1:47:54.500
 Yeah, it's the way comedians are nervous.

1:47:54.500 --> 1:47:59.220
 Like Joe Rogan just did his special this weekend.

1:47:59.220 --> 1:48:02.620
 And so he now has to sit nervously,

1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:03.860
 like a comedian does,

1:48:03.860 --> 1:48:07.060
 which is like, I have no material now.

1:48:07.060 --> 1:48:07.900
 Right.

1:48:07.900 --> 1:48:08.740
 I have to start from scratch.

1:48:08.740 --> 1:48:10.820
 When I was doing the lectures constantly,

1:48:10.820 --> 1:48:13.420
 instead of the Q and As,

1:48:13.420 --> 1:48:14.860
 basically what I was doing

1:48:14.860 --> 1:48:17.820
 was writing a whole book chapter every night.

1:48:17.820 --> 1:48:20.340
 And now that's a bit of an exaggeration

1:48:20.340 --> 1:48:22.700
 because I would return to themes that I had developed,

1:48:22.700 --> 1:48:24.540
 but it's not really an exaggeration

1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:29.420
 because I didn't ever just go over, wrote material ever.

1:48:30.260 --> 1:48:33.060
 So it's very demanding.

1:48:33.060 --> 1:48:34.540
 And that part's nerve wracking

1:48:34.540 --> 1:48:36.460
 because I sit down, it's an hour before the show.

1:48:36.460 --> 1:48:41.060
 And I think, can I do this?

1:48:41.060 --> 1:48:45.060
 And the answer is what you did it 1,000 times,

1:48:45.060 --> 1:48:46.940
 but that's not this time.

1:48:46.940 --> 1:48:49.180
 It's like, can I come up with a question?

1:48:49.180 --> 1:48:51.300
 Can I think through the structure?

1:48:51.300 --> 1:48:56.140
 Can I pull off the spontaneous narrative?

1:48:56.140 --> 1:48:57.460
 Can I pull it together?

1:48:57.460 --> 1:49:00.100
 And the answer is, I don't know.

1:49:00.100 --> 1:49:02.700
 And so then I get it together in my mind, I think.

1:49:02.700 --> 1:49:03.540
 And that's hard.

1:49:03.540 --> 1:49:05.820
 It takes effort and it's nerve wracking.

1:49:06.860 --> 1:49:07.740
 Okay, I got it.

1:49:07.740 --> 1:49:09.700
 But then there's the moment you go out on stage

1:49:09.700 --> 1:49:12.300
 and you think, well, I know I had it,

1:49:12.300 --> 1:49:13.460
 but can I do it?

1:49:13.460 --> 1:49:15.180
 No notes.

1:49:15.180 --> 1:49:16.380
 And then the question is,

1:49:16.380 --> 1:49:18.820
 well, you're gonna find out while you do it.

1:49:18.820 --> 1:49:23.820
 And so then I go out on stage and I don't talk to the audience.

1:49:24.460 --> 1:49:26.620
 I talk to one person at a time.

1:49:27.780 --> 1:49:29.620
 And you can talk to one person,

1:49:29.620 --> 1:49:30.580
 because you know how to do that.

1:49:30.580 --> 1:49:32.460
 So I talk to a person and not too long

1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:33.900
 because I don't wanna make them too nervous.

1:49:33.900 --> 1:49:35.980
 And then someone else and someone else.

1:49:35.980 --> 1:49:38.020
 And then I'm in contact with the audience

1:49:38.020 --> 1:49:41.140
 and then I can tell if the words are landing

1:49:41.140 --> 1:49:43.460
 and I listen is like, are they wrestling around?

1:49:44.620 --> 1:49:46.140
 Are they dead quiet?

1:49:46.140 --> 1:49:47.700
 Because you want dead quiet.

1:49:47.700 --> 1:49:51.500
 You're, oh, I see, that's what focus sounds like.

1:49:51.500 --> 1:49:53.500
 You're in it together then.

1:49:53.500 --> 1:49:54.340
 You bet.

1:49:54.340 --> 1:49:55.700
 Well, and I also, here's a good rule

1:49:55.700 --> 1:49:57.740
 if you're learning to speak publicly.

1:49:57.740 --> 1:49:59.180
 I never say a word

1:50:00.500 --> 1:50:04.620
 till everyone is 100% quiet.

1:50:04.620 --> 1:50:06.700
 And that's, it's a great way to start a talk

1:50:06.700 --> 1:50:08.980
 because you're set in the frame, eh?

1:50:08.980 --> 1:50:11.620
 And if the frame is we'll all talk while you're talking,

1:50:11.620 --> 1:50:14.460
 the message is, well, you can talk.

1:50:14.460 --> 1:50:16.220
 This is a place where everybody can talk.

1:50:16.220 --> 1:50:17.900
 It's like, no, it's not.

1:50:17.900 --> 1:50:21.180
 This is a place where people paid to hear me talk.

1:50:21.180 --> 1:50:24.020
 So I'm not gonna talk till everyone's listening.

1:50:24.020 --> 1:50:26.980
 And so then you get that stillness

1:50:26.980 --> 1:50:28.180
 and then you just wait

1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:30.820
 because that stillness turns into an expectation.

1:50:30.820 --> 1:50:31.820
 And then it comes,

1:50:31.820 --> 1:50:34.420
 turns into a kind of nervous expectations

1:50:34.420 --> 1:50:35.940
 like what the hell is he doing?

1:50:35.940 --> 1:50:37.140
 It's not manipulative.

1:50:37.140 --> 1:50:38.700
 It's a sense of timing.

1:50:38.700 --> 1:50:40.420
 It's like, just when that's right,

1:50:40.420 --> 1:50:42.940
 you think, okay, now it's time to start.

1:50:42.940 --> 1:50:44.340
 Well, the interesting thing

1:50:44.340 --> 1:50:46.500
 about that nervous expectation is

1:50:46.500 --> 1:50:49.380
 from an audience perspective, we're in it together.

1:50:49.380 --> 1:50:50.220
 Yeah.

1:50:50.220 --> 1:50:51.580
 I mean, there is into that silence,

1:50:51.580 --> 1:50:53.140
 there's a togetherness to it.

1:50:53.140 --> 1:50:55.420
 Of course, it's the union of everyone's attention.

1:50:55.420 --> 1:50:56.260
 Yeah.

1:50:56.260 --> 1:50:58.460
 Yeah, and that's, and that's a great thing.

1:50:58.460 --> 1:50:59.940
 I mean, you love that at a concert

1:50:59.940 --> 1:51:01.740
 when everyone, it's not silence then,

1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:03.940
 but when everyone's attention is unified

1:51:03.940 --> 1:51:05.260
 and everyone's moving in unison,

1:51:05.260 --> 1:51:08.700
 it's like, we're all worshiping the same thing.

1:51:08.700 --> 1:51:09.540
 Right?

1:51:09.540 --> 1:51:11.500
 And that would be the point of the conversation,

1:51:11.500 --> 1:51:13.700
 the point of the lecture

1:51:13.700 --> 1:51:16.660
 and the worship is the direction of attention towards it.

1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:18.260
 And it's communion

1:51:18.260 --> 1:51:20.660
 because everyone's doing it at the same time.

1:51:20.660 --> 1:51:23.300
 And so, I mean, there's not much difference

1:51:23.300 --> 1:51:25.460
 between a lecture theater and a church in that regard,

1:51:25.460 --> 1:51:26.300
 right?

1:51:26.300 --> 1:51:28.500
 It's the same fundamental layout and structure.

1:51:28.500 --> 1:51:30.980
 And they're very integrally associated with one another.

1:51:30.980 --> 1:51:32.260
 One really grew out of the other,

1:51:32.260 --> 1:51:34.340
 the lecture theater grew out of the church.

1:51:34.340 --> 1:51:36.340
 So it's perfectly reasonable

1:51:36.340 --> 1:51:38.580
 to be thinking about it in those terms.

1:51:38.580 --> 1:51:42.220
 And so, and then, okay, so after the lecture,

1:51:42.220 --> 1:51:43.860
 we play a piece of music

1:51:43.860 --> 1:51:45.580
 that is a piece of music

1:51:45.580 --> 1:51:47.980
 that I've been producing with some musicians

1:51:47.980 --> 1:51:51.020
 for a couple of books I'm gonna release in the fall.

1:51:51.020 --> 1:51:53.780
 Terrible books, ABC of Childhood Tragedy,

1:51:53.780 --> 1:51:57.180
 they're called dark, dark books,

1:51:58.500 --> 1:52:02.300
 dark and comical books, terrible books,

1:52:03.180 --> 1:52:05.260
 but heartbreaking illustrations.

1:52:06.340 --> 1:52:07.620
 We've set them to music.

1:52:07.620 --> 1:52:09.420
 And so, we play a piece from that.

1:52:09.420 --> 1:52:13.580
 And then afterwards, I usually meet about 150 people

1:52:13.580 --> 1:52:14.540
 to have photographs.

1:52:14.540 --> 1:52:17.220
 And so, each of those is a little...

1:52:17.220 --> 1:52:20.020
 Is there a little sparkle of a human connection yet?

1:52:20.020 --> 1:52:22.460
 A lot, a lot.

1:52:22.460 --> 1:52:26.460
 It's very intense, 10 seconds with every person.

1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:28.620
 You think, well, how can 10 seconds be intense?

1:52:28.620 --> 1:52:31.860
 It's like, pay enough attention.

1:52:31.860 --> 1:52:33.260
 It gets intense real quick.

1:52:33.260 --> 1:52:36.900
 Does it break your heart to say goodbye so many times?

1:52:36.900 --> 1:52:39.060
 It's like being in a wedding lineup.

1:52:39.060 --> 1:52:41.180
 At a wedding that you want to be at.

1:52:41.180 --> 1:52:42.820
 And everybody's dressed up.

1:52:42.820 --> 1:52:43.780
 And that's so weird, eh?

1:52:43.780 --> 1:52:45.300
 Because I bought these expensive suits

1:52:45.300 --> 1:52:47.660
 when I went on tour and it broke my heart

1:52:47.660 --> 1:52:48.940
 because I spent so much money on them.

1:52:48.940 --> 1:52:51.380
 I thought, God, that's completely unconscionable.

1:52:51.380 --> 1:52:55.460
 I thought, no way, man, I'm in this 100%.

1:52:55.460 --> 1:52:58.820
 And so, I'm gonna dress with respect.

1:52:58.820 --> 1:53:03.820
 And like 60% of the audience comes in

1:53:04.380 --> 1:53:05.900
 two or three piece suits.

1:53:05.900 --> 1:53:07.460
 They're all dressed up.

1:53:07.460 --> 1:53:09.260
 Then there's this line to greet me

1:53:09.260 --> 1:53:11.220
 and they're all happy to see me.

1:53:11.220 --> 1:53:13.460
 That's not so hard to take.

1:53:13.460 --> 1:53:15.100
 Although it is in a sense, right?

1:53:15.100 --> 1:53:19.020
 Because normal interactions are pretty shallow.

1:53:19.020 --> 1:53:21.020
 And you think, I don't want shallow interactions.

1:53:21.020 --> 1:53:22.860
 It's like, yes, you do most of the time.

1:53:22.860 --> 1:53:24.500
 Yeah, it's intense.

1:53:24.500 --> 1:53:25.700
 It's very intense.

1:53:25.700 --> 1:53:26.660
 And I don't know if you have.

1:53:26.660 --> 1:53:28.300
 But you've had a taste of this, no doubt.

1:53:28.300 --> 1:53:29.140
 Because people recognize that.

1:53:29.140 --> 1:53:31.300
 Yeah, but I also have,

1:53:31.300 --> 1:53:34.500
 when a person recognizes me and they come with the love

1:53:34.500 --> 1:53:37.620
 and they're often brilliant people,

1:53:37.620 --> 1:53:39.860
 one of the thoughts I have to deal with,

1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:42.420
 one of the dragons in my own mind is,

1:53:42.420 --> 1:53:44.340
 you know, thinking that I don't deserve

1:53:44.340 --> 1:53:45.900
 that kind of attention.

1:53:45.900 --> 1:53:46.740
 And so...

1:53:46.740 --> 1:53:48.220
 Well, you probably don't.

1:53:48.220 --> 1:53:49.060
 Right, I don't.

1:53:49.060 --> 1:53:50.300
 But maybe you could.

1:53:50.300 --> 1:53:53.060
 It's a burden in that I have to step up

1:53:53.060 --> 1:53:56.260
 to be the kind of person that deserves that,

1:53:56.260 --> 1:53:58.220
 not deserves that, but in part deserves

1:53:58.220 --> 1:53:59.140
 that kind of attention.

1:53:59.140 --> 1:54:01.260
 And that's like, holy shit.

1:54:01.260 --> 1:54:02.580
 It's crucially important too,

1:54:02.580 --> 1:54:05.180
 because if someone comes up to you in an airport

1:54:05.180 --> 1:54:08.060
 and they know who you are and they're brave enough

1:54:08.060 --> 1:54:11.220
 to admire you or who you are attempting to be

1:54:11.220 --> 1:54:16.220
 and you make a mistake, they will never forget it.

1:54:16.740 --> 1:54:19.300
 So it's a high stakes enterprise.

1:54:19.300 --> 1:54:23.140
 And the flip side of that, especially with young people,

1:54:23.140 --> 1:54:25.460
 a few words you can say can change the direction

1:54:25.460 --> 1:54:26.420
 of their life.

1:54:26.420 --> 1:54:28.140
 One way or another.

1:54:28.140 --> 1:54:30.260
 And so I really have to watch this too in airports

1:54:30.260 --> 1:54:31.660
 because I do not like airports.

1:54:31.660 --> 1:54:34.580
 I do not like the creeping totalitarianism in airports.

1:54:34.580 --> 1:54:36.340
 They've always bothered me.

1:54:36.340 --> 1:54:38.340
 They really bother me.

1:54:38.340 --> 1:54:40.260
 And I'm an unpleasant travel companion

1:54:40.260 --> 1:54:41.980
 for my wife sometimes because of that.

1:54:41.980 --> 1:54:43.500
 Although I think we've worked that out,

1:54:43.500 --> 1:54:46.380
 thank God, because we're doing a lot of traveling.

1:54:46.380 --> 1:54:50.860
 But most of the security guards and the border personnel,

1:54:50.860 --> 1:54:52.300
 all those people, they know me.

1:54:52.300 --> 1:54:53.980
 And as a general rule,

1:54:53.980 --> 1:54:55.620
 they're positively predisposed to me.

1:54:55.620 --> 1:54:57.700
 And so if I'm peevish or irritable,

1:54:57.700 --> 1:55:02.700
 then, well, that's not good, it's not good.

1:55:03.500 --> 1:55:05.260
 And so that's a tight rope to walk to

1:55:05.260 --> 1:55:08.580
 because I do not like that creeping totalitarianism.

1:55:08.580 --> 1:55:09.940
 But by the same token,

1:55:12.100 --> 1:55:13.780
 if you're just one of the crowd,

1:55:13.780 --> 1:55:18.340
 just sometimes it's good just to be one of the crowd

1:55:18.340 --> 1:55:19.540
 and then you're a little irritable

1:55:19.540 --> 1:55:21.060
 and people can just brush that off.

1:55:21.060 --> 1:55:26.060
 But if you're someone they have dared to open their heart to,

1:55:26.060 --> 1:55:28.020
 because that's what admiration is,

1:55:28.020 --> 1:55:32.220
 and then you're, and you betray that,

1:55:32.220 --> 1:55:35.660
 then that's a real, they'll never forget it.

1:55:35.660 --> 1:55:38.140
 And then they'll tell everyone too.

1:55:38.140 --> 1:55:41.140
 So that takes a lot of alertness.

1:55:41.140 --> 1:55:43.340
 And so Tammy in our life has got complicated day

1:55:43.340 --> 1:55:45.420
 because in Toronto, for example,

1:55:45.420 --> 1:55:48.300
 we can't really just go for a walk.

1:55:48.300 --> 1:55:50.780
 It's always a high drama production

1:55:50.780 --> 1:55:52.540
 because always people come up

1:55:52.540 --> 1:55:56.020
 and they have some heartrending story to tell

1:55:56.020 --> 1:55:58.100
 and I'm not being cynical about that.

1:55:59.340 --> 1:56:03.780
 It's a hard thing to bear because people don't do that.

1:56:03.780 --> 1:56:05.940
 They don't just open themselves up to you like that

1:56:05.940 --> 1:56:07.700
 and share the tragedy of their life.

1:56:10.620 --> 1:56:12.620
 But that's an everyday occurrence.

1:56:12.620 --> 1:56:14.580
 And so when we go up to our cottage,

1:56:14.580 --> 1:56:18.180
 which is out of the city, it's a relief,

1:56:18.180 --> 1:56:22.340
 because as wonderful as that is,

1:56:22.340 --> 1:56:23.940
 like it's a weird, I have a weird life

1:56:23.940 --> 1:56:25.300
 because everywhere I go,

1:56:25.300 --> 1:56:26.660
 it's very weird.

1:56:26.660 --> 1:56:29.180
 It's like I'm surrounded by old friends

1:56:29.180 --> 1:56:32.380
 because I walk down the street in any city now virtually

1:56:32.380 --> 1:56:34.460
 and people say, hello, Dr. Peterson.

1:56:34.460 --> 1:56:37.020
 So nice to see, or they say better things than not,

1:56:37.020 --> 1:56:38.820
 very rarely bad things.

1:56:38.820 --> 1:56:42.820
 One experience in 5,000 maybe, very rare,

1:56:42.820 --> 1:56:44.940
 although you don't forget those either,

1:56:44.940 --> 1:56:47.620
 but it's very strange.

1:56:49.300 --> 1:56:51.540
 And there's an intimacy, they know you well

1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:56.540
 and because they leap into, they avoid the small talk often.

1:56:57.580 --> 1:56:58.780
 They leap into familiarity.

1:56:58.780 --> 1:57:00.940
 It really is like it's an old friend

1:57:00.940 --> 1:57:01.900
 and it feels like that.

1:57:01.900 --> 1:57:06.500
 For me personally, the experience is the goodbye hurts

1:57:06.500 --> 1:57:10.860
 because there's a sense where you're never gonna see

1:57:10.860 --> 1:57:11.700
 that friend again.

1:57:11.700 --> 1:57:12.740
 Right.

1:57:12.740 --> 1:57:14.420
 Yeah, that's a strange thing.

1:57:14.420 --> 1:57:19.420
 So to me, a lot of it just feels like goodbyes.

1:57:19.420 --> 1:57:23.420
 Yes, you're right about that.

1:57:23.420 --> 1:57:26.740
 And I mean, that's, I suppose in some sense,

1:57:26.740 --> 1:57:29.540
 part of the pain of opening yourself up to people

1:57:29.540 --> 1:57:33.100
 because they also, Tammy has been struck particularly,

1:57:33.100 --> 1:57:35.460
 she said, I really never knew what men were like.

1:57:35.460 --> 1:57:36.940
 I said, well, what do you mean?

1:57:36.940 --> 1:57:41.140
 She said, I cannot believe how polite the men are

1:57:41.140 --> 1:57:42.700
 when they come and talk to you

1:57:42.700 --> 1:57:45.660
 because it's always the same, the pattern's very similar.

1:57:45.660 --> 1:57:47.780
 The person comes up, they're mostly men, not always,

1:57:47.780 --> 1:57:49.220
 but mostly.

1:57:49.220 --> 1:57:51.700
 And they're tentative and they're very polite,

1:57:51.700 --> 1:57:53.580
 very, very polite.

1:57:53.580 --> 1:57:55.620
 And they say, I hope I'm not bothering you.

1:57:55.620 --> 1:57:57.020
 Do you mind, do you mind it?

1:57:57.020 --> 1:57:59.140
 I say that they're not bothering me.

1:58:00.300 --> 1:58:02.260
 And I'm doing everything I can

1:58:02.260 --> 1:58:04.500
 to not be the guy who's bothered by that.

1:58:04.500 --> 1:58:05.940
 It's like, who do you think you are?

1:58:05.940 --> 1:58:06.780
 Yeah.

1:58:06.780 --> 1:58:07.620
 Yes.

1:58:07.620 --> 1:58:12.140
 You're the guy that what is famous and now is above that?

1:58:12.140 --> 1:58:13.300
 Yeah.

1:58:13.300 --> 1:58:15.300
 You don't wanna be that guy.

1:58:15.300 --> 1:58:17.820
 So you wanna be grateful all the time

1:58:17.820 --> 1:58:20.620
 when people open up like that.

1:58:20.620 --> 1:58:23.300
 And so you gotta be alert and on point

1:58:23.300 --> 1:58:25.220
 to do that properly, like right away.

1:58:25.220 --> 1:58:28.660
 Cause for these, for you, it's five seconds or 10 seconds

1:58:28.660 --> 1:58:30.180
 or 20 seconds, whatever it is.

1:58:30.180 --> 1:58:34.020
 But for them, they've opened up.

1:58:34.020 --> 1:58:37.580
 And so you can really nail them if you're foolish.

1:58:37.580 --> 1:58:40.700
 After the 150 people, how do you come down from that?

1:58:40.700 --> 1:58:44.700
 How do you find yourself again?

1:58:44.700 --> 1:58:48.460
 Well, that was often when I got caught in Twitter traps.

1:58:48.460 --> 1:58:52.060
 Cause I'm so burnt out by then from the talk

1:58:52.060 --> 1:58:56.300
 and the audience interactions and the whole day.

1:58:56.300 --> 1:58:58.260
 Cause it's a new city, it's a new hotel,

1:58:58.260 --> 1:59:02.300
 it's a new 5,000 people, it's a new book chapter,

1:59:02.300 --> 1:59:04.220
 it's a whole new horizon of ideas

1:59:04.220 --> 1:59:06.780
 and it's off to another city the next day.

1:59:06.780 --> 1:59:10.780
 I'm so burnt out by then that I'm not as good

1:59:10.780 --> 1:59:13.540
 at controlling my impulses as I might be

1:59:13.540 --> 1:59:15.380
 and Twitter was a real catastrophe for that

1:59:15.380 --> 1:59:17.540
 cause it would hook me and then I couldn't,

1:59:17.540 --> 1:59:20.860
 like I used to, when I was working on my book a lot,

1:59:20.860 --> 1:59:22.340
 I used to call Tammy and say,

1:59:22.340 --> 1:59:23.820
 look, you have to come and get me.

1:59:23.820 --> 1:59:26.300
 I can't stop, I can't stop.

1:59:26.300 --> 1:59:28.420
 I got tired and then I kind of,

1:59:28.420 --> 1:59:31.780
 cause it's part of a kind of hypomanic focus.

1:59:31.780 --> 1:59:32.860
 I couldn't quit.

1:59:32.860 --> 1:59:34.740
 It's like, oh no, I'm still writing.

1:59:34.740 --> 1:59:37.340
 I need to get away from this, but I couldn't stop.

1:59:37.340 --> 1:59:42.340
 And so it's better to, to read something, a book.

1:59:45.020 --> 1:59:48.540
 Fiction, nonfiction, fiction, Stephen King.

1:59:48.540 --> 1:59:50.340
 I was reading a lot of Stephen King

1:59:50.340 --> 1:59:51.540
 when I was on tour last time.

1:59:51.540 --> 1:59:52.460
 That was good.

1:59:52.460 --> 1:59:53.500
 I liked Stephen King a lot.

1:59:53.500 --> 1:59:54.620
 It's a great narratives.

1:59:54.620 --> 1:59:57.820
 Great and great characterization, you know?

1:59:57.820 --> 2:00:02.700
 So, and there's a familiarity about Stephen King's writing

2:00:02.700 --> 2:00:05.380
 too that it's, he writes about people you know.

2:00:05.380 --> 2:00:08.140
 And so I really found that a relief.

2:00:08.140 --> 2:00:10.300
 And so that was useful.

2:00:10.300 --> 2:00:12.940
 And that in order to tolerate this, let's say,

2:00:12.940 --> 2:00:15.180
 or to be able to sustain it,

2:00:15.180 --> 2:00:16.740
 well, let's take a lot of negotiation

2:00:16.740 --> 2:00:17.860
 on the part of Tammy and I,

2:00:17.860 --> 2:00:21.460
 because she's dragged into this and, you know,

2:00:21.460 --> 2:00:25.100
 her life is part of this, whatever this is.

2:00:25.100 --> 2:00:29.060
 And she's had to find her way and has, for example,

2:00:29.060 --> 2:00:32.380
 now she has a different hotel room than me when we travel.

2:00:32.380 --> 2:00:36.340
 And she found that she didn't wanna be on the tour this spring

2:00:36.340 --> 2:00:37.940
 and I was ill again for part of it

2:00:37.940 --> 2:00:39.060
 and that made it complicated.

2:00:39.060 --> 2:00:42.180
 But she went away back home and she came back

2:00:42.180 --> 2:00:43.420
 and she said, and she was nervous about it.

2:00:43.420 --> 2:00:45.420
 She said, I think I need my own room.

2:00:45.420 --> 2:00:47.140
 And part of me was not happy with that.

2:00:47.140 --> 2:00:48.500
 It's like, what do you mean you need your,

2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:50.340
 like, are we not married anymore?

2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:52.380
 It's like, you need your own room.

2:00:52.380 --> 2:00:54.820
 And she said, well, you know, I can't,

2:00:54.820 --> 2:00:57.260
 she has to do exercises because she was really sick

2:00:57.260 --> 2:00:59.860
 and she has to keep herself in shape.

2:00:59.860 --> 2:01:02.220
 And she has to have some time to do that.

2:01:02.220 --> 2:01:03.780
 She does a lot of prayer and meditation

2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:05.900
 and she needs the time and she has her own podcast

2:01:05.900 --> 2:01:07.820
 which is going quite well and she needs the time.

2:01:07.820 --> 2:01:11.500
 And I trust her and she said, well, I need this

2:01:11.500 --> 2:01:12.460
 in order to continue.

2:01:12.460 --> 2:01:15.980
 And I thought, well, okay, if you need this

2:01:15.980 --> 2:01:19.020
 in order to continue, yes.

2:01:19.020 --> 2:01:20.380
 Because she went away and didn't say,

2:01:20.380 --> 2:01:22.540
 well, I don't wanna be on the tour.

2:01:22.540 --> 2:01:23.500
 I don't wanna do this anymore.

2:01:23.500 --> 2:01:25.940
 She went away and prayed, let's say,

2:01:25.940 --> 2:01:28.820
 how can I continue to do this?

2:01:28.820 --> 2:01:30.420
 And that was the answer.

2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:32.740
 And so she has her own hotel room

2:01:32.740 --> 2:01:36.140
 and that was a really good decision on her part.

2:01:36.140 --> 2:01:39.700
 And she's very good and getting better all the time

2:01:39.700 --> 2:01:43.820
 at figuring out what has to happen for her

2:01:43.820 --> 2:01:45.180
 to make this sustainable.

2:01:45.180 --> 2:01:48.380
 And all that's been is a plus

2:01:48.380 --> 2:01:51.020
 because I don't wanna travel without her

2:01:51.020 --> 2:01:53.580
 and I don't want her life to be miserable

2:01:53.580 --> 2:01:55.540
 and I want her to be fully on board.

2:01:55.540 --> 2:01:58.260
 And so she has to be properly selfish

2:01:58.260 --> 2:02:00.700
 like everyone does in a relationship.

2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:02.980
 And you have to, not just that yet,

2:02:02.980 --> 2:02:05.300
 this is a weird thing that you're doing.

2:02:05.300 --> 2:02:08.260
 And you have to, both you and her have to figure out

2:02:08.260 --> 2:02:13.260
 how to manage this very intense intellectual social journey.

2:02:13.300 --> 2:02:15.260
 Well, there's another element to it too

2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:16.420
 that I didn't tell you about.

2:02:16.420 --> 2:02:18.020
 So that was a typical day,

2:02:18.020 --> 2:02:19.540
 but it's missing a big component

2:02:19.540 --> 2:02:21.580
 because usually we also have a dinner

2:02:21.580 --> 2:02:25.740
 with like 30 cultural representatives,

2:02:25.740 --> 2:02:28.700
 I suppose 10 to 30 from each country

2:02:28.700 --> 2:02:32.100
 because I have a network of people who have networks

2:02:32.100 --> 2:02:35.780
 who are setting me up with key decision makers

2:02:35.780 --> 2:02:37.140
 in each country.

2:02:37.140 --> 2:02:39.540
 And so then we have like an hour and a half of that.

2:02:39.540 --> 2:02:42.420
 Now, sometimes that's on a day when I don't have a talk

2:02:42.420 --> 2:02:44.860
 but sometimes the talks are back to back.

2:02:44.860 --> 2:02:49.660
 And so she also has to manage that and to be gracious.

2:02:49.660 --> 2:02:51.700
 And then people are showing us exciting things

2:02:51.700 --> 2:02:53.940
 and tours in the cities, which is all,

2:02:53.940 --> 2:02:56.380
 like it's a surf fight of wonderful.

2:02:56.380 --> 2:02:57.340
 Yes, exactly.

2:02:57.340 --> 2:03:00.220
 But it's still, yeah, you have to be there for it.

2:03:00.220 --> 2:03:02.660
 You have to be present for it mentally.

2:03:02.660 --> 2:03:04.980
 As a curious mind, as an intellectual mind.

2:03:04.980 --> 2:03:07.820
 How do you get to sleep?

2:03:07.820 --> 2:03:11.820
 Fortunately, that is almost never a problem.

2:03:11.820 --> 2:03:16.820
 Even when I was unbelievably ill for about three years,

2:03:17.220 --> 2:03:18.380
 I thought about that a lot too.

2:03:18.380 --> 2:03:20.500
 You know, that I didn't do a really good job

2:03:20.500 --> 2:03:22.140
 of explaining that while I was ill

2:03:22.140 --> 2:03:24.780
 because it appeared in some sense

2:03:24.780 --> 2:03:25.900
 that the reason I was ill

2:03:25.900 --> 2:03:28.260
 was because I was taking benzodiazepines.

2:03:28.260 --> 2:03:32.300
 But that isn't why I was ill and then I took them

2:03:32.300 --> 2:03:35.060
 and very low dose and I took that for a long time

2:03:35.060 --> 2:03:37.300
 and it helped whatever was wrong with me.

2:03:37.300 --> 2:03:39.380
 And it looks like it was an allergy

2:03:39.380 --> 2:03:41.040
 or maybe multiple allergies.

2:03:42.020 --> 2:03:45.020
 And then that stopped working.

2:03:45.020 --> 2:03:47.860
 And so I took a little bit more for about a month

2:03:47.860 --> 2:03:48.980
 and that made it way worse.

2:03:48.980 --> 2:03:50.900
 And so then I cut back a lot

2:03:50.900 --> 2:03:54.820
 and then things really got out of hand and so.

2:03:54.820 --> 2:03:57.940
 So there was a deeper thing in the benzo.

2:03:57.940 --> 2:04:00.300
 What can you put words to?

2:04:00.300 --> 2:04:01.620
 Well, I had a lot of immune.

2:04:01.620 --> 2:04:03.580
 Well, my daughter, as everyone knows,

2:04:03.580 --> 2:04:06.140
 has a very reactive immune system

2:04:06.140 --> 2:04:09.900
 and Tammy has three immunological conditions.

2:04:09.900 --> 2:04:11.500
 Each of them quite serious.

2:04:11.500 --> 2:04:14.440
 And I had psoriasis and peripheral uveitis,

2:04:14.440 --> 2:04:15.860
 which is an autoimmune condition

2:04:15.860 --> 2:04:20.460
 and allopecia areata and chronic gum disease.

2:04:20.460 --> 2:04:23.060
 All of which appeared to be allergy related.

2:04:23.060 --> 2:04:25.740
 And so Michaela seems to have got all of that.

2:04:25.740 --> 2:04:28.500
 And so that, and that I think was at the bottom of,

2:04:28.500 --> 2:04:30.620
 because I also had this proclivity to depression

2:04:30.620 --> 2:04:32.900
 that was part of my family history.

2:04:32.900 --> 2:04:34.780
 But I think that was all immunological

2:04:34.780 --> 2:04:35.620
 as far as I can tell.

2:04:35.620 --> 2:04:37.860
 So one of the things that's happened to me,

2:04:37.860 --> 2:04:40.540
 I always noticed I really couldn't breathe.

2:04:40.540 --> 2:04:42.300
 Like I could breathe about one fifth

2:04:42.300 --> 2:04:45.200
 as much as I sometimes could.

2:04:46.580 --> 2:04:48.500
 And so I was always short of breath

2:04:48.500 --> 2:04:53.140
 and it looks like what that was perhaps was,

2:04:53.140 --> 2:04:56.460
 I was always on the border of an anaphylactic reaction,

2:04:56.460 --> 2:04:57.700
 which is not pleasant.

2:04:58.820 --> 2:05:01.220
 And that's hypersympathetic activation,

2:05:01.220 --> 2:05:03.220
 no parasympathetic activation.

2:05:03.220 --> 2:05:05.580
 I couldn't relax at all.

2:05:05.580 --> 2:05:07.500
 That's an immunological response.

2:05:07.500 --> 2:05:08.900
 Allergic response, yeah.

2:05:10.060 --> 2:05:11.660
 So anyways, that was what seemed,

2:05:11.660 --> 2:05:14.500
 now I don't like to talk about this much

2:05:14.500 --> 2:05:15.780
 because it's so bloody radical

2:05:15.780 --> 2:05:17.300
 and I don't like to propagate it,

2:05:17.300 --> 2:05:19.660
 but this diet seems to have stopped all of that.

2:05:19.660 --> 2:05:22.660
 I don't have psoriasis, all of the patches have gone.

2:05:22.660 --> 2:05:25.500
 My gum disease, which is incurable,

2:05:25.500 --> 2:05:27.260
 I had multiple surgeries to deal with it,

2:05:27.260 --> 2:05:29.140
 is completely gone.

2:05:29.140 --> 2:05:30.380
 Took three years.

2:05:30.380 --> 2:05:32.260
 My right eye, which was quite cloudy,

2:05:32.260 --> 2:05:33.540
 it's cleared up completely.

2:05:35.860 --> 2:05:36.940
 What else has changed?

2:05:36.940 --> 2:05:41.260
 Well, I lost 50 pounds and like instantly and kept it off.

2:05:41.260 --> 2:05:45.940
 I should mention that I too am not a deep investigator

2:05:45.940 --> 2:05:47.740
 of nutritional science.

2:05:47.740 --> 2:05:49.660
 I have my skepticism towards the degree

2:05:49.660 --> 2:05:51.620
 to which it is currently science

2:05:51.620 --> 2:05:53.340
 because like a lot of complex systems,

2:05:53.340 --> 2:05:55.500
 it's very, it's full of mystery

2:05:55.500 --> 2:05:58.020
 and full of profiteers,

2:05:58.020 --> 2:06:00.140
 the people that profit of different kinds of diets.

2:06:00.140 --> 2:06:02.340
 But I should say for me personally,

2:06:02.340 --> 2:06:05.140
 it does seem that I feel by far the best

2:06:05.140 --> 2:06:06.380
 when I eat only meat.

2:06:06.380 --> 2:06:07.300
 It's very interesting.

2:06:07.300 --> 2:06:10.860
 And I discovered that a long time ago, first of all.

2:06:10.860 --> 2:06:12.260
 How do you discover it?

2:06:12.260 --> 2:06:15.580
 So by the discovery went like this,

2:06:15.580 --> 2:06:17.980
 I started listening to ultra marathon runners

2:06:17.980 --> 2:06:21.660
 about 15 years ago and they started talking

2:06:21.660 --> 2:06:25.740
 about fat adapted running.

2:06:27.300 --> 2:06:31.140
 So I first discovered that I don't have to run super fast

2:06:31.140 --> 2:06:32.460
 to enjoy running.

2:06:32.460 --> 2:06:35.540
 Then in fact, I really enjoy running at a slower pace.

2:06:36.420 --> 2:06:37.740
 So that was like step one is like,

2:06:37.740 --> 2:06:42.740
 oh, okay, if I maintain something called the math rule,

2:06:42.820 --> 2:06:45.060
 which is the pretty low heart rate.

2:06:45.060 --> 2:06:47.780
 If I maintain that, you can actually get pretty fast

2:06:47.780 --> 2:06:50.700
 while maintaining a pretty slow average speed in general.

2:06:50.700 --> 2:06:55.780
 Anyway, they fuel themselves on low carb diets.

2:06:55.780 --> 2:06:57.340
 So I got into that.

2:06:57.340 --> 2:07:00.660
 On top of that, they also fast often.

2:07:00.660 --> 2:07:05.660
 So I discovered how incredible my mind feels when fasted.

2:07:05.900 --> 2:07:08.300
 People call it intermittent fasting, but 20.

2:07:08.300 --> 2:07:10.460
 Well, that's an organization of death,

2:07:10.460 --> 2:07:15.460
 because when you fast your body logically and obviously

2:07:16.100 --> 2:07:18.420
 if you think about it biologically is,

2:07:18.420 --> 2:07:20.860
 well, what is your body scavenged first?

2:07:20.860 --> 2:07:23.020
 Well, damaged tissue.

2:07:24.180 --> 2:07:28.580
 So I know the literature on fasting to some degree

2:07:28.580 --> 2:07:30.660
 and it's very compelling literature.

2:07:30.660 --> 2:07:35.060
 If you starve dogs down, I think it's 20% below rats too,

2:07:35.060 --> 2:07:38.140
 below their optimal body weight, they live 30% longer.

2:07:38.140 --> 2:07:43.140
 Yeah, that's a lot, 30%, like it's like 30%, yeah, 30%.

2:07:43.860 --> 2:07:46.380
 Well, there is aspect to a lot of these things

2:07:46.380 --> 2:07:47.300
 that make me nervous,

2:07:47.300 --> 2:07:49.740
 because I always feel like there's no free lunch

2:07:49.740 --> 2:07:51.540
 that I'm gonna pay for it somehow,

2:07:51.540 --> 2:07:55.980
 but there is a focus that I am able to attain when I fast,

2:07:55.980 --> 2:07:57.900
 especially when I eat once a day.

2:07:57.900 --> 2:08:01.380
 My mind is almost like nervously focused.

2:08:01.380 --> 2:08:04.100
 It's almost like an anxiety, but a positive one,

2:08:04.100 --> 2:08:07.180
 or one that I can channel into just like an excitement.

2:08:07.180 --> 2:08:10.500
 You know, I wonder how much of that's associated with,

2:08:10.500 --> 2:08:13.980
 well, imagine that that signifies lack of food,

2:08:13.980 --> 2:08:16.020
 which is not that hard to imagine.

2:08:16.020 --> 2:08:17.900
 Well, maybe you should be a lot more alert

2:08:17.900 --> 2:08:19.300
 in that situation, right?

2:08:19.300 --> 2:08:22.780
 Biologically speaking, because you're in hunting mode,

2:08:22.780 --> 2:08:26.580
 let's say, you know, not desperate, but in hunting mode,

2:08:26.580 --> 2:08:29.460
 and God only knows maybe human beings

2:08:29.460 --> 2:08:31.180
 should be in hunting mode all the time.

2:08:31.180 --> 2:08:32.860
 Often, but we don't know that.

2:08:32.860 --> 2:08:37.500
 So I wonder if it has a stress on the system

2:08:37.500 --> 2:08:39.940
 that long term causes the system to get sick.

2:08:39.940 --> 2:08:41.300
 It doesn't look like it.

2:08:41.300 --> 2:08:43.660
 It seems in the case of fasting, not.

2:08:43.660 --> 2:08:45.020
 And then on top of that,

2:08:45.020 --> 2:08:47.780
 I discovered that the thing I enjoy,

2:08:47.780 --> 2:08:52.100
 I just don't enjoy eating fat as much.

2:08:52.100 --> 2:08:54.180
 So I love eating meat,

2:08:54.180 --> 2:08:55.660
 and when you talk about low carb diets,

2:08:55.660 --> 2:08:58.020
 so I just discovered through that process,

2:08:58.020 --> 2:09:00.900
 if somewhat fatty meat, but just meat,

2:09:00.900 --> 2:09:05.140
 I just feel a lot of the things that make me feel weird

2:09:05.140 --> 2:09:08.780
 about food, like a little groggy or like full,

2:09:08.780 --> 2:09:13.780
 or just whatever, the aspects of food that I don't enjoy,

2:09:14.140 --> 2:09:15.780
 they're not there with meat.

2:09:15.780 --> 2:09:18.380
 And I'm still able to enjoy company.

2:09:18.380 --> 2:09:22.340
 And when I eat once a day and eat meat,

2:09:22.340 --> 2:09:26.460
 at least in Texas, you could still have all the merriment

2:09:26.460 --> 2:09:28.820
 of you have dinner with friends.

2:09:28.820 --> 2:09:30.940
 Now, I don't do the, you know,

2:09:30.940 --> 2:09:35.940
 you have a very serious thing that there's health benefits

2:09:37.180 --> 2:09:39.460
 that you are very serious about.

2:09:39.460 --> 2:09:41.580
 For me, I can still drink whiskey.

2:09:41.580 --> 2:09:46.060
 I'll still do the things that add a little bit of spice.

2:09:46.060 --> 2:09:47.620
 Spice into the thing.

2:09:47.620 --> 2:09:49.700
 Now, when you completely remove the spice,

2:09:49.700 --> 2:09:52.300
 it does become more difficult.

2:09:52.300 --> 2:09:53.780
 Yeah, it's more difficult socially.

2:09:53.780 --> 2:09:56.540
 And Tammy seems to only be able to eat lamb,

2:09:56.540 --> 2:09:58.860
 although she might be able to eat nonaged beef.

2:09:58.860 --> 2:10:02.260
 And that makes traveling complicated too, right?

2:10:02.260 --> 2:10:04.620
 Because, well, for obvious reasons,

2:10:04.620 --> 2:10:06.620
 it's like, really, that's all you can eat.

2:10:08.020 --> 2:10:09.780
 Yeah, well, say la vie.

2:10:09.780 --> 2:10:12.340
 And maybe that's a form of craziness, but...

2:10:12.340 --> 2:10:14.580
 If we can return to actually the thing you were talking

2:10:14.580 --> 2:10:16.940
 about when you were thinking about a question

2:10:16.940 --> 2:10:20.660
 before the lecture, let me ask you about thinking in general.

2:10:22.860 --> 2:10:25.780
 This is something maybe that you and Jim Keller think

2:10:25.780 --> 2:10:27.780
 a lot about, is thinking how to think.

2:10:29.180 --> 2:10:32.940
 How do you think through an idea?

2:10:32.940 --> 2:10:35.540
 Well, first of all, I think, okay,

2:10:36.500 --> 2:10:38.100
 that's a really good question.

2:10:38.100 --> 2:10:40.140
 We've tried to work that out with this SA app

2:10:40.140 --> 2:10:41.500
 that my son and I have developed

2:10:41.500 --> 2:10:43.500
 because if you're gonna write, the first question is,

2:10:43.500 --> 2:10:45.100
 well, what should I write about?

2:10:45.100 --> 2:10:46.100
 What's the name of the app?

2:10:46.100 --> 2:10:46.940
 SA.app.

2:10:48.180 --> 2:10:51.300
 And, well, the first question is,

2:10:51.300 --> 2:10:53.580
 well, what bugs you?

2:10:53.580 --> 2:10:54.860
 What's bugging you?

2:10:54.860 --> 2:10:56.020
 This is such a cool thing.

2:10:56.020 --> 2:10:57.820
 It's like, where is my destiny?

2:10:59.260 --> 2:11:00.820
 Well, what bothers you?

2:11:00.820 --> 2:11:02.220
 Well, that's where your destiny is.

2:11:02.220 --> 2:11:04.900
 Your destiny is to be found in what bothers you.

2:11:04.900 --> 2:11:07.380
 Why did those things bother you?

2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:09.700
 There's a lot of things you could be bothered by.

2:11:09.700 --> 2:11:13.580
 Like a million things, man, but some things grip you.

2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:16.740
 They bug you and they might make you resentful and bitter

2:11:16.740 --> 2:11:17.940
 because they bug you so much.

2:11:17.940 --> 2:11:20.060
 Like, they're your things, man.

2:11:20.060 --> 2:11:21.540
 They've got you.

2:11:21.540 --> 2:11:23.740
 So then I look for a question

2:11:23.740 --> 2:11:26.020
 that I would like the answer to,

2:11:26.020 --> 2:11:29.780
 that I don't, and I would really like the answer to it.

2:11:29.780 --> 2:11:32.420
 So I don't assume I already have the answer

2:11:32.420 --> 2:11:35.380
 because I would actually really like to have the answer.

2:11:35.380 --> 2:11:39.260
 So if I could get a better answer, great.

2:11:39.260 --> 2:11:40.260
 And so that's the first thing.

2:11:40.260 --> 2:11:41.700
 And that's like a prayer.

2:11:41.700 --> 2:11:45.340
 It's like, okay, here's a mystery.

2:11:45.340 --> 2:11:49.780
 I would like to delve into it further.

2:11:49.780 --> 2:11:51.100
 Well, so that's humility.

2:11:51.100 --> 2:11:52.660
 It's like, here's a mystery,

2:11:52.660 --> 2:11:54.180
 which means I don't know.

2:11:54.180 --> 2:11:55.980
 I would like to delve into it further,

2:11:55.980 --> 2:11:59.020
 which means I don't know enough already.

2:11:59.020 --> 2:12:01.940
 And then comes the revelation.

2:12:01.940 --> 2:12:04.420
 It's like, well, what's a revelation?

2:12:04.420 --> 2:12:08.700
 Well, if you ask yourself a question, it's a real question.

2:12:08.700 --> 2:12:10.420
 Do you get an answer or not?

2:12:10.420 --> 2:12:11.740
 The answer is, well, yeah,

2:12:11.740 --> 2:12:14.100
 thoughts start to appear in your head.

2:12:14.100 --> 2:12:14.940
 So...

2:12:14.940 --> 2:12:15.780
 From somewhere.

2:12:15.780 --> 2:12:16.620
 That's right, from somewhere.

2:12:16.620 --> 2:12:17.820
 Where do they come from?

2:12:17.820 --> 2:12:19.380
 Do you have a sense?

2:12:19.380 --> 2:12:21.700
 Depends on what you're aiming at.

2:12:21.700 --> 2:12:23.220
 Depends on the question.

2:12:23.220 --> 2:12:26.260
 No, it does to some degree.

2:12:26.260 --> 2:12:29.060
 It depends on your intent.

2:12:29.060 --> 2:12:32.500
 So imagine that your intent is to make things better.

2:12:33.940 --> 2:12:35.340
 Then maybe they come from the place

2:12:35.340 --> 2:12:37.300
 that's designed to make things better.

2:12:37.300 --> 2:12:39.820
 Maybe your intent is to make things worse.

2:12:39.820 --> 2:12:41.340
 Then they come from hell.

2:12:42.300 --> 2:12:43.420
 And you think, no, it really,

2:12:43.420 --> 2:12:45.860
 it's like, you're so sure about that, are you?

2:12:45.860 --> 2:12:47.380
 But is your intent conscious?

2:12:47.380 --> 2:12:49.460
 Like, are you able to respect what the intent is?

2:12:49.460 --> 2:12:51.740
 It's conscious and habitual, right?

2:12:51.740 --> 2:12:54.060
 Because as you practice something consciously,

2:12:54.060 --> 2:12:56.220
 it becomes habitual, but it's conscious.

2:12:56.220 --> 2:12:59.620
 It's like, when I sit down before I do a lecture,

2:12:59.620 --> 2:13:01.700
 I think, okay, what's the goal here?

2:13:01.700 --> 2:13:04.140
 To do the best job I can.

2:13:04.140 --> 2:13:05.100
 To what end?

2:13:05.100 --> 2:13:08.540
 Well, people are coming here, not for political issues.

2:13:08.540 --> 2:13:09.740
 They're coming here because they're trying

2:13:09.740 --> 2:13:11.780
 to make their lives better.

2:13:11.780 --> 2:13:13.020
 Okay, so what are we doing?

2:13:13.020 --> 2:13:14.940
 We're conducting a joint investigation

2:13:14.940 --> 2:13:17.500
 into the nature of that, which makes life better.

2:13:17.500 --> 2:13:20.260
 Okay, what's my role? To do as good a job

2:13:20.260 --> 2:13:21.780
 about that as possible?

2:13:21.780 --> 2:13:23.620
 What state of mind do I have to be in?

2:13:23.620 --> 2:13:25.980
 Am I annoyed about the theater?

2:13:25.980 --> 2:13:30.260
 Or am I clued in and thrilled that 4,000 people

2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:33.620
 have showed up at substantial expense and trouble

2:13:33.620 --> 2:13:35.420
 to come and listen to me talk?

2:13:35.420 --> 2:13:37.220
 And if I'm not in that state of mind, I think,

2:13:37.220 --> 2:13:38.380
 well, maybe I need something to eat,

2:13:38.380 --> 2:13:39.940
 or maybe I need to talk to someone,

2:13:39.940 --> 2:13:44.500
 because that ingratitude is no place to start.

2:13:44.500 --> 2:13:47.020
 It's like, I should be thrilled to be there.

2:13:47.020 --> 2:13:48.180
 Obviously.

2:13:48.180 --> 2:13:50.260
 And so that orientation has to be there.

2:13:50.260 --> 2:13:51.460
 And then I, is it conscious?

2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:52.740
 All this is conscious.

2:13:52.740 --> 2:13:53.860
 What am I serving?

2:13:53.860 --> 2:13:55.780
 The highest good I can conceptualize.

2:13:55.780 --> 2:13:56.900
 What is that?

2:13:56.900 --> 2:14:00.180
 I have some sense, but I don't know it in the final analysis,

2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:02.620
 which is why the investigation is being conducted.

2:14:02.620 --> 2:14:03.660
 Who's doing it?

2:14:03.660 --> 2:14:07.820
 Me, whoever I'm communing with, and the audience.

2:14:07.820 --> 2:14:10.060
 And so I try to get myself,

2:14:10.060 --> 2:14:11.540
 and I chase everybody away for that.

2:14:11.540 --> 2:14:13.500
 It's like, I have to do that by myself.

2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:14.820
 Are you writing stuff down?

2:14:14.820 --> 2:14:18.220
 Yes, at that point, I just make point notes.

2:14:18.220 --> 2:14:20.980
 And it's usually about maybe 30 notes.

2:14:20.980 --> 2:14:23.300
 But then on stage, I never refer to them.

2:14:23.300 --> 2:14:26.620
 And I often don't even use the structure that I laid out.

2:14:26.620 --> 2:14:28.300
 Kind of an interesting thing.

2:14:28.300 --> 2:14:30.660
 From where do powerful phrases come from?

2:14:30.660 --> 2:14:34.820
 Do you ever, do you try to encapsulate an idea

2:14:34.820 --> 2:14:37.220
 into a sentence or two?

2:14:37.220 --> 2:14:42.220
 Well, when I talk, I practice this since consciously,

2:14:42.220 --> 2:14:46.620
 since 1985.

2:14:46.620 --> 2:14:51.620
 I try to feel and see if the words are stepping stones

2:14:52.140 --> 2:14:53.860
 or foundation stones, right?

2:14:53.860 --> 2:14:55.260
 Is this solid?

2:14:55.260 --> 2:14:56.500
 Is this word solid?

2:14:56.500 --> 2:14:57.860
 Is this phrase solid?

2:14:57.860 --> 2:14:59.620
 Is this sentence solid?

2:14:59.620 --> 2:15:04.620
 It's a real sense of fundamental foundation under each word.

2:15:05.100 --> 2:15:08.220
 And I suppose people ask me if I pray,

2:15:08.220 --> 2:15:12.340
 and I would say, I pray before every word.

2:15:14.220 --> 2:15:16.300
 Well, when you're asking questions,

2:15:16.300 --> 2:15:21.220
 like you're very clear headed and present

2:15:21.220 --> 2:15:25.540
 in your ability to ask questions and inquire.

2:15:25.540 --> 2:15:27.340
 So how do you do that?

2:15:27.340 --> 2:15:32.340
 So first of all, I'm worried that my mind easily gets trapped

2:15:32.340 --> 2:15:37.340
 when I step on a word and I know it's unstable.

2:15:38.340 --> 2:15:40.620
 You kind of realize that you don't really know

2:15:40.620 --> 2:15:43.140
 the definitions of any words you use.

2:15:43.140 --> 2:15:46.940
 And that can be debilitating.

2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:51.940
 So I kind of try to be more carefree about the words I use.

2:15:52.940 --> 2:15:54.380
 Because otherwise you get trapped.

2:15:54.380 --> 2:15:56.420
 You don't want to be obsessional.

2:15:56.420 --> 2:15:59.340
 Like literally, you don't want to be obsessional.

2:15:59.340 --> 2:16:02.420
 You don't want to be obsessional.

2:16:02.420 --> 2:16:04.900
 Like literally, my mind halfway through the sentence

2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:08.660
 will think, well, what does the word sentence mean?

2:16:08.660 --> 2:16:09.660
 Right, right, right.

2:16:09.660 --> 2:16:10.980
 Well, you know, neurologically.

2:16:10.980 --> 2:16:12.660
 And then everything else just explodes.

2:16:12.660 --> 2:16:14.740
 You're a big picture idea explodes

2:16:14.740 --> 2:16:17.380
 and you lost yourself in the minutia.

2:16:17.380 --> 2:16:21.860
 Well, neurologically, there's a production center

2:16:21.860 --> 2:16:23.820
 and an editing center.

2:16:23.820 --> 2:16:27.220
 And those can be separately affected by strokes.

2:16:27.220 --> 2:16:30.420
 And so often when people are writing or talking,

2:16:30.420 --> 2:16:33.140
 they try to activate both at the same time.

2:16:33.140 --> 2:16:35.740
 And that's so people will try to write an essay

2:16:35.740 --> 2:16:37.540
 and get every sentence right in the first draft.

2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:38.980
 That's a big mistake.

2:16:38.980 --> 2:16:40.940
 And so then you might say, well, how can you be careful

2:16:40.940 --> 2:16:42.820
 with your words, but carefree?

2:16:42.820 --> 2:16:46.220
 And the answer is orient yourself properly, right?

2:16:46.220 --> 2:16:48.300
 While in the conversation we're having,

2:16:48.300 --> 2:16:50.060
 you have an orientation structure.

2:16:50.060 --> 2:16:52.060
 You want to be prepared.

2:16:52.060 --> 2:16:53.900
 You want to be attentive.

2:16:53.900 --> 2:16:56.380
 Then you want to have an interesting conversation.

2:16:56.380 --> 2:16:58.380
 And you want to have the kind of interesting conversation

2:16:58.380 --> 2:17:01.540
 that other people want to listen to

2:17:01.540 --> 2:17:04.500
 that will be good for them in some manner.

2:17:04.500 --> 2:17:06.340
 Okay, so that's pretty good frame.

2:17:06.340 --> 2:17:09.220
 And then you kind of scour your heart

2:17:09.220 --> 2:17:10.820
 and you think, is that really what you want?

2:17:10.820 --> 2:17:12.860
 Are you after fame or after notoriety?

2:17:12.860 --> 2:17:14.260
 Are you after money?

2:17:14.260 --> 2:17:17.820
 I'm not saying any of those things are necessarily bad,

2:17:17.820 --> 2:17:20.100
 but they're not optimal,

2:17:20.100 --> 2:17:22.860
 especially if you're not willing to admit them, right?

2:17:22.860 --> 2:17:24.700
 And so they can contaminate you.

2:17:24.700 --> 2:17:26.820
 So you want to be decontaminated.

2:17:26.820 --> 2:17:29.540
 So you have the right trip, let's say.

2:17:29.540 --> 2:17:31.940
 And so you have to put yourself,

2:17:31.940 --> 2:17:33.140
 that's a meditative practice,

2:17:33.140 --> 2:17:36.660
 you have to put yourself in the right receptive position

2:17:36.660 --> 2:17:38.180
 with the right goal in mind.

2:17:38.180 --> 2:17:43.020
 Then you can, and I think you can get better and better

2:17:43.020 --> 2:17:47.340
 at this, then you can trust what's going to happen.

2:17:47.340 --> 2:17:49.660
 You know, so for example, before I came here,

2:17:49.660 --> 2:17:54.660
 I mean, I presume you have a reason for doing the podcast

2:17:54.860 --> 2:17:56.860
 with me, what's the reason?

2:18:00.020 --> 2:18:03.060
 I mean, we wanted to talk for a long time.

2:18:03.060 --> 2:18:04.580
 So the reason has evolved.

2:18:05.900 --> 2:18:10.900
 The one of the reasons is I've listened to you

2:18:12.260 --> 2:18:13.220
 for quite a long time.

2:18:13.220 --> 2:18:15.580
 So you become a one way friend.

2:18:15.580 --> 2:18:17.700
 And I have many one way friends,

2:18:17.700 --> 2:18:20.220
 some of my best friends don't even know I exist.

2:18:21.300 --> 2:18:24.020
 So I'm a big fan of podcasts and audiobooks.

2:18:24.020 --> 2:18:26.060
 Actually, most of my friends are dead.

2:18:26.060 --> 2:18:26.900
 Yeah, right.

2:18:28.020 --> 2:18:28.860
 The writers of the...

2:18:28.860 --> 2:18:30.140
 The definition of a reader.

2:18:32.140 --> 2:18:34.380
 With a lot of dead, great dead friends.

2:18:34.380 --> 2:18:37.500
 So I wanted to meet this one way friend, I suppose,

2:18:37.500 --> 2:18:39.500
 and have a conversation.

2:18:39.500 --> 2:18:42.420
 And then there's this kind of puzzle

2:18:42.420 --> 2:18:44.620
 that I've been longing to solve the same reason

2:18:44.620 --> 2:18:48.980
 I went to Ukraine of asking this question of myself,

2:18:48.980 --> 2:18:52.980
 who am I and what was this part of the world?

2:18:52.980 --> 2:18:56.260
 What is this thing that happened in the 20th century

2:18:56.260 --> 2:18:59.420
 that I lost so much of my family there

2:18:59.420 --> 2:19:03.540
 and I feel so much of my family is defined by that place?

2:19:03.540 --> 2:19:06.860
 Now that place includes the Soviet Union.

2:19:06.860 --> 2:19:09.620
 It includes Russia and Ukraine.

2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:11.100
 It includes Nazi Germany,

2:19:11.100 --> 2:19:16.100
 includes these big powerful leaders and huge millions

2:19:16.980 --> 2:19:20.900
 of people that were lost in the beauty,

2:19:20.900 --> 2:19:22.100
 the power of the dream,

2:19:22.100 --> 2:19:27.100
 but were also the torture that was forced onto them

2:19:29.260 --> 2:19:33.540
 through different governmental institutions.

2:19:33.540 --> 2:19:37.340
 And you are somebody that seemed from some angle

2:19:37.340 --> 2:19:41.980
 to also be drawn to try to understand what was that?

2:19:41.980 --> 2:19:44.700
 And not in some sort of historical sense,

2:19:44.700 --> 2:19:47.340
 but in a deeply psychological human sense.

2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:48.180
 What is that?

2:19:48.180 --> 2:19:49.700
 Will it repeat again?

2:19:49.700 --> 2:19:51.740
 In what ways are repeating again?

2:19:51.740 --> 2:19:53.100
 And how can we stop it?

2:19:53.100 --> 2:19:54.100
 And how can we stop it?

2:19:54.100 --> 2:19:54.940
 And so...

2:19:54.940 --> 2:19:55.780
 That's the crucial issue.

2:19:55.780 --> 2:20:00.100
 I felt I wanted to, from a very different backgrounds,

2:20:02.020 --> 2:20:04.220
 pull at the thread of that curiosity.

2:20:04.220 --> 2:20:08.580
 You know, I'm an engineer, you're a psychologist,

2:20:08.580 --> 2:20:12.740
 both lost in that curiosity and both were suits.

2:20:14.060 --> 2:20:17.060
 And a talk with various levels of eloquence

2:20:18.740 --> 2:20:23.620
 about sort of the shadows that these,

2:20:23.620 --> 2:20:28.620
 that history cast on us.

2:20:28.620 --> 2:20:30.340
 And so that was one.

2:20:30.340 --> 2:20:31.620
 And also the psychology.

2:20:31.620 --> 2:20:33.700
 I wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time.

2:20:33.700 --> 2:20:37.740
 I was fascinated by the human mind.

2:20:38.900 --> 2:20:41.100
 Until I discovered artificial intelligence,

2:20:41.100 --> 2:20:44.220
 the fact that I could program and make a robot move.

2:20:44.220 --> 2:20:47.700
 And until I discovered that magic,

2:20:47.700 --> 2:20:50.060
 I thought I wanted to understand the human mind

2:20:50.060 --> 2:20:52.100
 by being a psychiatrist, by talking to people,

2:20:52.100 --> 2:20:55.020
 by through talk therapy, psychotherapy.

2:20:55.020 --> 2:20:56.740
 So now you got the best of both worlds

2:20:56.740 --> 2:20:59.780
 because you get to talk to people and you get to build robots.

2:20:59.780 --> 2:21:03.620
 Yeah, I mean, but the dream ultimately is the robot.

2:21:03.620 --> 2:21:05.860
 That I felt like by building the thing,

2:21:05.860 --> 2:21:08.380
 can you start to try to understand it?

2:21:08.380 --> 2:21:09.460
 I think that's one way.

2:21:09.460 --> 2:21:12.500
 I mean, we all have different skills of proclivity.

2:21:12.500 --> 2:21:17.500
 So like my particular one has to do with,

2:21:20.140 --> 2:21:22.100
 I learned by building.

2:21:22.100 --> 2:21:25.540
 I think through a thing by building it.

2:21:25.540 --> 2:21:27.660
 And programming is a wonderful thing

2:21:27.660 --> 2:21:30.620
 because it allows you to like build a little toy example.

2:21:30.620 --> 2:21:31.460
 So in the same way,

2:21:31.460 --> 2:21:33.780
 you can do a little thought experiment,

2:21:33.780 --> 2:21:35.780
 programming allows you to create a thought experiment

2:21:35.780 --> 2:21:37.540
 in action, it can move, it can live,

2:21:37.540 --> 2:21:40.260
 it can, and then you can ask questions of it.

2:21:40.260 --> 2:21:45.260
 So all of those, because I'm interested in Freud and Young,

2:21:46.860 --> 2:21:51.860
 you're also in different ways have delved deeply

2:21:52.740 --> 2:21:56.700
 into humanity, the human psyche,

2:21:56.700 --> 2:22:00.300
 through the perspective of those psychologists.

2:22:00.300 --> 2:22:04.380
 So for all those reasons, I thought are a password for us.

2:22:04.380 --> 2:22:07.500
 Yeah, so that's quite a frame for a discussion, right?

2:22:07.500 --> 2:22:09.860
 You had all sorts of reasons and then you think,

2:22:09.860 --> 2:22:13.180
 well, are you just letting the conversation go where it will?

2:22:13.180 --> 2:22:15.460
 It's like, well, not exactly.

2:22:15.460 --> 2:22:17.820
 You spent all this time,

2:22:17.820 --> 2:22:19.820
 it's not like this came about by accident,

2:22:19.820 --> 2:22:23.020
 this conversation, you spent all this time framing it.

2:22:23.020 --> 2:22:26.780
 And so all of that provides the implicit substructure

2:22:26.780 --> 2:22:28.580
 for the play in the conversation.

2:22:28.580 --> 2:22:31.500
 And if you have that implicit, here's another way,

2:22:31.500 --> 2:22:34.300
 this is very much worth knowing is

2:22:34.300 --> 2:22:36.940
 if you get the implicit structure of perception, right?

2:22:36.940 --> 2:22:39.140
 Everything becomes a game.

2:22:40.580 --> 2:22:42.300
 And not only that, a game you wanna play

2:22:42.300 --> 2:22:44.100
 and maybe in the final analysis,

2:22:44.100 --> 2:22:45.860
 a game you'd wanna play forever.

2:22:47.060 --> 2:22:52.060
 So, you know, that's obviously a distant beckoning ideal,

2:22:52.220 --> 2:22:57.220
 but we know only games need rules or there's no play.

2:22:57.220 --> 2:22:58.340
 Okay.

2:22:58.340 --> 2:23:03.180
 Is there advice you can give now that we know the frame

2:23:03.180 --> 2:23:08.180
 to give to me, Lex, about how to do this podcast better,

2:23:09.580 --> 2:23:14.580
 how to think about this world,

2:23:18.020 --> 2:23:19.940
 how to be a good engineer,

2:23:20.980 --> 2:23:24.300
 how to be a good human being.

2:23:24.300 --> 2:23:25.540
 From what you know about me.

2:23:25.540 --> 2:23:28.220
 Take your preoccupation with suffering seriously.

2:23:29.380 --> 2:23:33.780
 It's a serious business, right?

2:23:33.780 --> 2:23:36.660
 And that's part of that to circle back to the beginning,

2:23:36.660 --> 2:23:40.140
 let's say that's that willingness to gaze into the abyss,

2:23:40.140 --> 2:23:41.580
 which is obviously what you were doing

2:23:41.580 --> 2:23:43.460
 when you went to Ukraine.

2:23:43.460 --> 2:23:48.460
 It's like, it's gazing into the abyss that makes you better.

2:23:48.460 --> 2:23:52.180
 The thing is, and this is maybe where Nietzsche's ideas

2:23:52.180 --> 2:23:57.180
 not as differentiated as it became, sometimes your gaze

2:23:58.740 --> 2:24:02.780
 can be forcefully directed towards the abyss,

2:24:02.780 --> 2:24:04.940
 and then you're traumatized.

2:24:04.940 --> 2:24:08.160
 If it's involuntary and accidental, it can kill you.

2:24:09.140 --> 2:24:14.140
 The more it's voluntary, the more transformative it is.

2:24:14.900 --> 2:24:18.220
 And that's part of that idea about facing death and hell.

2:24:18.220 --> 2:24:21.300
 It's like, can you tolerate death and hell?

2:24:21.300 --> 2:24:26.300
 And the answer is this terrible answer is yes,

2:24:26.580 --> 2:24:31.580
 to the degree that you're willing to do it voluntarily.

2:24:31.580 --> 2:24:33.380
 And then you might ask, well,

2:24:33.380 --> 2:24:37.340
 why should I have to subject myself to death and hell?

2:24:37.340 --> 2:24:38.980
 I'm innocent.

2:24:38.980 --> 2:24:40.740
 And then the answer to that is

2:24:44.900 --> 2:24:47.900
 even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed

2:24:47.900 --> 2:24:51.900
 to the highest good.

2:24:54.340 --> 2:24:56.420
 That's such an interesting distinction.

2:24:58.700 --> 2:24:59.780
 Voluntary suffering.

2:24:59.780 --> 2:25:01.340
 Voluntary, yeah.

2:25:01.340 --> 2:25:02.180
 Yeah.

2:25:02.180 --> 2:25:04.900
 Well, that's why the central Christian doctrine is,

2:25:04.900 --> 2:25:06.980
 pick up your cross and follow me.

2:25:08.460 --> 2:25:11.740
 And I'm speaking, not in religious terms, saying that.

2:25:11.740 --> 2:25:13.580
 I'm just speaking as a psychologist.

2:25:13.580 --> 2:25:15.360
 It's like one of the things we've learned

2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:19.300
 in the last hundred years is voluntary exposure to that,

2:25:19.300 --> 2:25:22.140
 which freezes and terrifies you

2:25:22.140 --> 2:25:25.280
 in measured proportions is curative.

2:25:26.700 --> 2:25:30.260
 So a form of, at least in part,

2:25:30.260 --> 2:25:32.500
 involuntary sufferings, depression.

2:25:34.980 --> 2:25:38.920
 Do you have advice for people on how to find a way out?

2:25:40.380 --> 2:25:43.540
 You're a man who has suffered in this way.

2:25:43.540 --> 2:25:46.180
 Perhaps continue to suffer in this way.

2:25:46.180 --> 2:25:47.700
 How do you find a way out?

2:25:51.820 --> 2:25:53.680
 The first thing I do as a clinician,

2:25:53.680 --> 2:25:55.740
 if someone comes to me and says they're depressed,

2:25:55.740 --> 2:25:57.400
 is ask myself a question.

2:25:58.500 --> 2:26:00.500
 Well, what does this person mean by that?

2:26:00.500 --> 2:26:02.380
 So I have to find out like,

2:26:02.380 --> 2:26:03.660
 because maybe they're not depressed,

2:26:03.660 --> 2:26:06.880
 maybe they're hyperanxious or maybe they're obsessional.

2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:10.420
 Like there's various forms of powerful negative emotion.

2:26:10.420 --> 2:26:12.380
 So they need to be differentiated.

2:26:12.380 --> 2:26:14.140
 But then the next question you have to ask is,

2:26:14.140 --> 2:26:16.900
 well, are you depressed?

2:26:16.900 --> 2:26:19.300
 Or do you have a terrible life?

2:26:19.300 --> 2:26:21.860
 Or is it some combination of the two?

2:26:21.860 --> 2:26:26.220
 So if you're depressed, as far as I can tell,

2:26:26.220 --> 2:26:27.780
 you don't have a terrible life.

2:26:29.140 --> 2:26:30.900
 You have friends, you have family,

2:26:30.900 --> 2:26:32.180
 you have an intimate relationship,

2:26:32.180 --> 2:26:33.700
 you have a job or a career.

2:26:33.700 --> 2:26:35.420
 You're about as educated as you should be

2:26:35.420 --> 2:26:36.860
 given your intelligence.

2:26:36.860 --> 2:26:39.260
 Use your time outside of work wisely.

2:26:39.260 --> 2:26:42.660
 You're not beholden to alcohol or other temptations.

2:26:44.180 --> 2:26:47.620
 You're engaged in the community in some fundamental sense

2:26:47.620 --> 2:26:49.460
 and all that's working.

2:26:49.460 --> 2:26:52.620
 Now, if you have all that and you're feeling really awful,

2:26:52.620 --> 2:26:54.940
 you're either ill or you're depressed.

2:26:54.940 --> 2:26:57.780
 And so then sometimes there's a biochemical route

2:26:57.780 --> 2:26:59.260
 to that treatment of that.

2:26:59.260 --> 2:27:02.900
 My experience as being as a clinician is if you're depressed,

2:27:02.900 --> 2:27:05.700
 but you have a life and you take an antidepressant,

2:27:05.700 --> 2:27:07.220
 it will probably help you a lot.

2:27:07.220 --> 2:27:10.060
 Now, maybe you're not depressed.

2:27:10.060 --> 2:27:10.900
 Exactly.

2:27:10.900 --> 2:27:12.780
 You just have a terrible life.

2:27:12.780 --> 2:27:14.100
 What does that look like?

2:27:15.980 --> 2:27:17.500
 You have no relationship.

2:27:17.500 --> 2:27:19.260
 Your family's a mess.

2:27:19.260 --> 2:27:20.780
 You've got no friends.

2:27:20.780 --> 2:27:21.860
 You've got no plan.

2:27:21.860 --> 2:27:22.780
 You've got no job.

2:27:23.780 --> 2:27:25.420
 You use your time outside of work,

2:27:25.420 --> 2:27:27.460
 not only badly, but destructively.

2:27:27.460 --> 2:27:29.860
 You have a drug or alcohol habit

2:27:29.860 --> 2:27:32.700
 or some other vice pornography addiction.

2:27:33.700 --> 2:27:36.460
 You are completely unengaged in the surrounding community.

2:27:36.460 --> 2:27:39.260
 You have no scaffolding whatsoever

2:27:39.260 --> 2:27:42.260
 to support you in your current mode of being

2:27:42.260 --> 2:27:43.660
 or you move forward.

2:27:43.660 --> 2:27:47.940
 And then as a therapist, well, you do two things.

2:27:47.940 --> 2:27:50.380
 Well, if it's depression per se,

2:27:50.380 --> 2:27:53.060
 well, like I said, there's sometimes a biochemical route,

2:27:53.060 --> 2:27:54.380
 a nutritional route.

2:27:54.380 --> 2:27:55.980
 There's ways that can be addressed.

2:27:55.980 --> 2:27:58.900
 It's probably physiological if you're, at least in part,

2:27:58.900 --> 2:28:01.100
 if you're depressed, but you have an okay life.

2:28:01.100 --> 2:28:03.020
 Sometimes it's conceptual.

2:28:03.020 --> 2:28:04.620
 You can turn to dreams.

2:28:04.620 --> 2:28:06.620
 Sometimes to help people

2:28:06.620 --> 2:28:09.780
 because dreams contain the seeds of the potential future.

2:28:09.780 --> 2:28:12.140
 And if your person is a real good dreamer

2:28:12.140 --> 2:28:14.540
 and you can analyze dreams, that can be really helpful.

2:28:14.540 --> 2:28:17.420
 But that seems to be only true for more creative people.

2:28:17.420 --> 2:28:19.460
 And for the people who just have a terrible life,

2:28:19.460 --> 2:28:22.780
 it's like, okay, you have a terrible life.

2:28:22.780 --> 2:28:26.820
 Well, let's pick a front.

2:28:26.820 --> 2:28:30.020
 How about you need a friend?

2:28:30.020 --> 2:28:33.060
 Like one sort of friend.

2:28:33.060 --> 2:28:36.260
 Do you know how to shake hands and introduce yourself?

2:28:36.260 --> 2:28:38.740
 I'll have the person show me.

2:28:38.740 --> 2:28:40.380
 So let's do it for a sec.

2:28:40.380 --> 2:28:45.020
 So it's like this, hi, I'm Jordan.

2:28:45.020 --> 2:28:46.740
 And people don't know how to do that.

2:28:46.740 --> 2:28:49.060
 And then they can't even get the ball rolling.

2:28:49.060 --> 2:28:51.300
 For the listener, Jordan just gave me a firm handshake.

2:28:51.300 --> 2:28:53.980
 Yeah, as opposed to a dead fish.

2:28:53.980 --> 2:28:56.900
 You know, and there's these elementary social skills

2:28:56.900 --> 2:28:59.740
 that hypothetically, if you were well cared for,

2:28:59.740 --> 2:29:02.020
 you learned when you were like three.

2:29:02.020 --> 2:29:03.580
 And sometimes people have,

2:29:03.580 --> 2:29:08.580
 I had lots of clients to whom no one ever paid any attention.

2:29:09.900 --> 2:29:12.700
 And they needed like 10,000 hours of attention.

2:29:12.700 --> 2:29:13.980
 And some of that was just listening

2:29:13.980 --> 2:29:17.580
 because they had 10,000 hours of conversations

2:29:17.580 --> 2:29:19.220
 they never had with anyone.

2:29:19.220 --> 2:29:21.580
 And they were all tangled up in their head.

2:29:21.580 --> 2:29:24.900
 And they had to just, one client in particular,

2:29:24.900 --> 2:29:28.460
 I worked with this person for 15 years.

2:29:28.460 --> 2:29:33.460
 And what she wanted from me was for me

2:29:33.740 --> 2:29:36.380
 just to shut the hell up for 50 minutes.

2:29:36.380 --> 2:29:37.980
 It was very hard for me.

2:29:37.980 --> 2:29:41.980
 And to just tell me what had happened to her.

2:29:41.980 --> 2:29:44.940
 And then what happened at the end of the conversation,

2:29:44.940 --> 2:29:48.100
 then I could discuss a bit with her.

2:29:48.100 --> 2:29:50.260
 And then as we progressed through the years,

2:29:50.260 --> 2:29:52.580
 the amount of time that we spent in discussion

2:29:52.580 --> 2:29:55.180
 increased in proportion in this sessions

2:29:55.180 --> 2:29:58.780
 until by the time we stopped seeing each other

2:29:58.780 --> 2:30:00.820
 when my clinical practice collapsed,

2:30:02.540 --> 2:30:06.340
 we were talking about 80% of the time.

2:30:06.340 --> 2:30:09.980
 But she literally, she'd never been attended to properly ever.

2:30:09.980 --> 2:30:13.620
 And so she was an uncarved block in the Taoist sense, right?

2:30:13.620 --> 2:30:16.380
 She hadn't been subjected to those flaming swords

2:30:16.380 --> 2:30:19.380
 that separated the wheat from the chaff.

2:30:19.380 --> 2:30:22.700
 And so you can do that in therapy.

2:30:22.700 --> 2:30:25.420
 If you're listening and you're depressed,

2:30:25.420 --> 2:30:28.340
 I would say if you can't find a therapist

2:30:28.340 --> 2:30:29.820
 and that's getting harder and harder

2:30:29.820 --> 2:30:32.220
 because it's actually become illegal to be a therapist now

2:30:32.220 --> 2:30:34.500
 because you have to agree with your clients,

2:30:34.500 --> 2:30:37.420
 which is a terrible thing to do with them.

2:30:37.420 --> 2:30:40.700
 Just like it's terrible just to arbitrarily oppose them.

2:30:40.700 --> 2:30:44.060
 You could do the self authoring program online

2:30:44.060 --> 2:30:46.580
 because it helps you write an autobiography.

2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:49.420
 And so if you have memories that are more than 18 months old

2:30:49.420 --> 2:30:51.580
 that bother you when you think them up,

2:30:51.580 --> 2:30:54.340
 part of you is locked inside that.

2:30:54.340 --> 2:30:59.340
 An undeveloped part of you is still trapped in that.

2:30:59.780 --> 2:31:01.660
 That's a metaphorical way of thinking about it.

2:31:01.660 --> 2:31:04.180
 That's why it still has emotional significance.

2:31:04.180 --> 2:31:06.820
 So you can write about your past experiences,

2:31:06.820 --> 2:31:08.780
 but I would say wait for at least 18 months

2:31:08.780 --> 2:31:10.500
 if something bad has happened to you.

2:31:10.500 --> 2:31:12.100
 Because otherwise you just hurt yourself again

2:31:12.100 --> 2:31:13.220
 by encountering it.

2:31:14.220 --> 2:31:16.740
 You can bring yourself up to date with an autobiography.

2:31:16.740 --> 2:31:18.980
 There's an analysis of faults and virtues.

2:31:18.980 --> 2:31:20.060
 That's the present authoring.

2:31:20.060 --> 2:31:23.700
 And then there's a guided writing exercise

2:31:23.700 --> 2:31:25.980
 that helps you make a future plan.

2:31:25.980 --> 2:31:30.460
 That's young men who do that could go to college.

2:31:30.460 --> 2:31:32.500
 Young men who do that, 90 minutes.

2:31:32.500 --> 2:31:34.460
 Just the future authoring, 90 minutes.

2:31:34.460 --> 2:31:37.260
 They're 50% less likely to drop out.

2:31:37.260 --> 2:31:38.900
 That's all it takes.

2:31:38.900 --> 2:31:43.580
 So sometimes depression is this heavy cloud

2:31:43.580 --> 2:31:46.340
 that makes it hard to even make a single step towards it.

2:31:46.340 --> 2:31:48.860
 Or you said isolate, make a friend.

2:31:48.860 --> 2:31:50.180
 Oh man, sometimes like I had.

2:31:50.180 --> 2:31:52.060
 The first step is extremely difficult.

2:31:52.060 --> 2:31:54.940
 Oh my God, sometimes it's way worse than that.

2:31:54.940 --> 2:31:57.060
 Like I had clients who were so depressed

2:31:57.060 --> 2:31:58.900
 they literally couldn't get out of bed.

2:31:59.940 --> 2:32:01.180
 So what's their first step?

2:32:01.180 --> 2:32:05.940
 It's like, can you sit up once today?

2:32:05.940 --> 2:32:06.780
 No.

2:32:07.980 --> 2:32:10.620
 Can you prop yourself up on your elbows once today?

2:32:10.620 --> 2:32:13.260
 Like you just, you scale back the dragon

2:32:14.100 --> 2:32:16.980
 till you find one that's conquerable

2:32:16.980 --> 2:32:18.140
 that moves you forward.

2:32:18.140 --> 2:32:19.900
 There's a rubric for life.

2:32:19.900 --> 2:32:23.180
 Scale back the dragons till you find one conquerable.

2:32:23.180 --> 2:32:25.900
 And it'll give you a little bit of gold.

2:32:25.900 --> 2:32:27.300
 Commensurate with the struggle.

2:32:27.300 --> 2:32:29.140
 But the plus side of that,

2:32:29.140 --> 2:32:31.060
 because you think that God, that's depressing.

2:32:31.060 --> 2:32:35.420
 You mean I have to start by sitting up?

2:32:35.420 --> 2:32:37.740
 Well, you do if you can't sit up.

2:32:37.740 --> 2:32:39.180
 But the plus side of that

2:32:39.180 --> 2:32:40.980
 is it's the Pareto distribution issue

2:32:40.980 --> 2:32:45.860
 is that aggregates exponentially increase.

2:32:45.860 --> 2:32:47.980
 And failures do too, by the way.

2:32:47.980 --> 2:32:50.140
 But aggregates exponentially increase.

2:32:50.140 --> 2:32:51.580
 So once you start the ball rolling

2:32:51.580 --> 2:32:53.380
 it can get zipping along pretty good.

2:32:53.380 --> 2:32:55.060
 This person that I talked about

2:32:56.660 --> 2:33:00.460
 was incapable of sitting with me in a cafe

2:33:00.460 --> 2:33:02.100
 when we first met just talking

2:33:02.100 --> 2:33:04.180
 even though I was her therapist.

2:33:04.180 --> 2:33:07.420
 But by the end, she was doing standup comedy.

2:33:08.300 --> 2:33:10.900
 So, it took years.

2:33:10.900 --> 2:33:14.020
 But still most people won't do standup comedy.

2:33:14.020 --> 2:33:15.940
 That's quite the bloody achievement.

2:33:15.940 --> 2:33:19.260
 She would read her poetry on stage too.

2:33:20.100 --> 2:33:23.860
 So for someone who was petrified into paralysis

2:33:23.860 --> 2:33:28.860
 by social anxiety and who had to start very small

2:33:29.060 --> 2:33:30.740
 there's a hell of an accomplishment.

2:33:31.620 --> 2:33:33.940
 Yeah, it all starts with one step.

2:33:33.940 --> 2:33:38.260
 Do you have advice for young people in high school?

2:33:38.260 --> 2:33:40.580
 You've given a lot of people look up to you

2:33:40.580 --> 2:33:42.540
 for advice, for strength,

2:33:42.540 --> 2:33:47.540
 for strength to search for themselves, to find themselves.

2:33:47.980 --> 2:33:49.700
 Take on some responsibility.

2:33:51.020 --> 2:33:53.260
 Do something for other people.

2:33:53.260 --> 2:33:55.700
 You're doing something for yourself while you're doing that

2:33:55.700 --> 2:33:57.820
 even if you don't know it for sure

2:33:57.820 --> 2:34:00.260
 because you're a community across time.

2:34:00.260 --> 2:34:02.580
 Find something to serve.

2:34:02.580 --> 2:34:03.740
 Somebody to help.

2:34:03.740 --> 2:34:06.980
 Someone to help a job to find a job.

2:34:06.980 --> 2:34:08.940
 Do your best with the customers.

2:34:08.940 --> 2:34:10.220
 Don't be above your job.

2:34:10.220 --> 2:34:11.780
 You're gonna get an entry level job

2:34:11.780 --> 2:34:14.700
 when you're a kid or what else would you want?

2:34:14.700 --> 2:34:15.540
 You wanna be the boss?

2:34:15.540 --> 2:34:16.380
 What do you know?

2:34:16.380 --> 2:34:17.780
 You don't know anything.

2:34:17.780 --> 2:34:19.540
 You could be the boss of your job.

2:34:20.700 --> 2:34:22.140
 If you're working in a grocery store

2:34:22.140 --> 2:34:23.380
 or you're working in a convenience store

2:34:23.380 --> 2:34:26.620
 assuming you're not working for terrified tyrants,

2:34:26.620 --> 2:34:28.700
 you can be nice to the customers.

2:34:28.700 --> 2:34:30.940
 You can develop your social skills.

2:34:30.940 --> 2:34:34.140
 You can learn how to handle boss employee relationship.

2:34:34.140 --> 2:34:36.060
 You can be there 15 minutes early

2:34:36.060 --> 2:34:37.780
 and leave 15 minutes late.

2:34:37.780 --> 2:34:40.380
 Like you can learn in an entry level job, man.

2:34:40.380 --> 2:34:42.900
 And I'll tell you, if you take an entry level job

2:34:42.900 --> 2:34:45.860
 and you learn and it's a reasonably decent place,

2:34:45.860 --> 2:34:48.460
 you will not be in an entry level job for long

2:34:48.460 --> 2:34:50.100
 because everyone who's competent

2:34:50.100 --> 2:34:52.140
 is desperate for competent people.

2:34:52.140 --> 2:34:54.180
 And if you go and show yourself as competent,

2:34:54.180 --> 2:34:55.180
 there'll be a trial period,

2:34:55.180 --> 2:34:57.180
 but if you go show yourself as competent,

2:34:57.180 --> 2:34:59.300
 all sorts of doors you didn't even know were there

2:34:59.300 --> 2:35:01.100
 will start opening like mad.

2:35:01.100 --> 2:35:04.460
 So you strive for competence, for craftsmanship.

2:35:04.460 --> 2:35:07.340
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, for discipline.

2:35:07.340 --> 2:35:11.020
 You know, I mean, I said in one of the chapters

2:35:11.020 --> 2:35:14.180
 of my books is focused on putting your house in order.

2:35:14.180 --> 2:35:16.740
 It's like, well, how do you start make your bed?

2:35:18.020 --> 2:35:21.540
 You know, it actually took me quite a long time in my life

2:35:21.540 --> 2:35:23.580
 before I made my bed regularly in the morning.

2:35:23.580 --> 2:35:25.380
 Most of my life was in pretty good order,

2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:27.660
 but that was one thing I didn't have in order.

2:35:27.660 --> 2:35:31.020
 My clothes and my closet as well, all that's in order.

2:35:31.020 --> 2:35:31.860
 Not all of it.

2:35:31.860 --> 2:35:33.300
 I'm cleaning out some drawers right now,

2:35:33.300 --> 2:35:37.980
 but look around and see what bugs you in your room.

2:35:37.980 --> 2:35:39.180
 Just look.

2:35:39.180 --> 2:35:40.940
 It's like, okay, I'm in my room.

2:35:40.940 --> 2:35:41.900
 Do I like this room?

2:35:41.900 --> 2:35:43.100
 No, it bugs me.

2:35:43.100 --> 2:35:44.820
 Okay, why?

2:35:44.820 --> 2:35:47.380
 Well, the paint's peeling there and it's dusty there

2:35:47.380 --> 2:35:50.900
 and the carpet's dirty and that corner's kind of ugly

2:35:50.900 --> 2:35:52.380
 and the light there isn't very good

2:35:52.380 --> 2:35:54.380
 and my clothes closet's a mess

2:35:54.380 --> 2:35:56.540
 so I don't even like to open it.

2:35:56.540 --> 2:35:59.180
 Okay, that's a lot of problems.

2:35:59.180 --> 2:36:00.380
 That sucks.

2:36:00.380 --> 2:36:02.340
 That's a lot of opportunity.

2:36:02.340 --> 2:36:04.300
 Pick something and fix it.

2:36:04.300 --> 2:36:05.980
 Something that bugs you.

2:36:05.980 --> 2:36:07.460
 Yeah, but not too much.

2:36:07.460 --> 2:36:10.220
 So the rule is pick something

2:36:10.220 --> 2:36:12.820
 that you know would make, pick a problem.

2:36:13.780 --> 2:36:16.940
 Pick a solution to it that you know wouldn't help,

2:36:16.940 --> 2:36:20.740
 that you could do, that you would do.

2:36:20.740 --> 2:36:22.220
 So you have to negotiate with yourself.

2:36:22.220 --> 2:36:23.860
 It's like, well, I won't clean up this room.

2:36:23.860 --> 2:36:24.700
 How do you know?

2:36:24.700 --> 2:36:25.820
 Well, I've been in here for 10 years

2:36:25.820 --> 2:36:27.060
 and I've never cleaned it up.

2:36:27.060 --> 2:36:29.700
 It's like, well, obviously that's too big a dragon for you.

2:36:29.700 --> 2:36:32.340
 Would you clean one drawer?

2:36:32.340 --> 2:36:33.180
 Find out.

2:36:34.020 --> 2:36:35.740
 And so imagine now you wanna be happy

2:36:35.740 --> 2:36:36.820
 when you open that drawer

2:36:36.820 --> 2:36:37.820
 and you think, well, that's stupid.

2:36:37.820 --> 2:36:38.700
 It's like, is it?

2:36:40.140 --> 2:36:41.580
 Maybe it's your sock drawer,

2:36:41.580 --> 2:36:44.380
 which I cleaned up in my room the other day, by the way.

2:36:44.380 --> 2:36:46.260
 You're gonna open that every morning.

2:36:47.580 --> 2:36:50.820
 So that's like 30 seconds of your life every day.

2:36:50.820 --> 2:36:54.940
 Okay, so that's three minutes a week.

2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:57.340
 That's 12 minutes a month.

2:36:57.340 --> 2:36:59.580
 That's two hours a year.

2:36:59.580 --> 2:37:01.060
 So maybe your life is made out,

2:37:01.060 --> 2:37:02.740
 if you've got 16 hours a day,

2:37:02.740 --> 2:37:05.340
 let's figure this out, five, 12 in an hour,

2:37:05.340 --> 2:37:09.220
 12 in an hour, 144 in 12 hours.

2:37:09.220 --> 2:37:12.060
 Yeah, let's say 200, 205 minute chunks.

2:37:12.060 --> 2:37:12.900
 That's your life.

2:37:12.900 --> 2:37:15.300
 Ladies and gentlemen, Jordan Peterson did just some math,

2:37:15.300 --> 2:37:17.460
 how many five minute chunks there are in a day.

2:37:17.460 --> 2:37:19.300
 And I'm pretty sure it's pretty accurate.

2:37:19.300 --> 2:37:20.620
 It's approximately right.

2:37:20.620 --> 2:37:24.580
 So you got 205 minute chunks and they repeat.

2:37:24.580 --> 2:37:26.380
 A lot of them repeat.

2:37:26.380 --> 2:37:28.260
 So if you get every one of those right,

2:37:28.260 --> 2:37:29.620
 they're trivial, right? Who cares?

2:37:29.620 --> 2:37:30.780
 What my sock drawer looks like.

2:37:30.780 --> 2:37:33.140
 It's like, fair enough, man, but that's your life.

2:37:33.140 --> 2:37:35.360
 The things you repeat every day.

2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:36.860
 The mundane things.

2:37:36.860 --> 2:37:39.380
 Think I could get all those mundane things right.

2:37:39.380 --> 2:37:40.660
 That's the game rules.

2:37:40.660 --> 2:37:43.420
 It's like, now all the mundane is in place.

2:37:43.420 --> 2:37:45.940
 Now you can play, cause all the mundane's in place.

2:37:45.940 --> 2:37:47.060
 And this is actually true.

2:37:47.060 --> 2:37:51.060
 So with children, imagine you want your children to play.

2:37:51.060 --> 2:37:53.700
 Well, play is very fragile neurologically.

2:37:53.700 --> 2:37:57.380
 Any competing motivation or emotion will suppress play.

2:37:57.380 --> 2:37:59.300
 So everything has to be an order.

2:38:00.300 --> 2:38:02.100
 Everything has to be a walled garden

2:38:02.100 --> 2:38:04.140
 before the children will play.

2:38:04.140 --> 2:38:05.980
 That's a good way of thinking about it.

2:38:05.980 --> 2:38:07.460
 So you put everything in order and you think,

2:38:07.460 --> 2:38:09.580
 oh my God, now I'm tyrannized by this order.

2:38:09.580 --> 2:38:12.580
 It's like, no, you aren't, not if it's voluntary.

2:38:12.580 --> 2:38:15.700
 And then the order is the precondition for the freedom.

2:38:15.700 --> 2:38:17.960
 And so then all of a sudden you get all these things in order.

2:38:17.960 --> 2:38:19.020
 It's like, oh, look at this.

2:38:19.020 --> 2:38:21.660
 I've got some room to play here.

2:38:21.660 --> 2:38:24.860
 And then maybe you're not depressed.

2:38:24.860 --> 2:38:28.660
 No, it's often not that simple, it's not that simple.

2:38:28.660 --> 2:38:31.100
 Try putting your room in order, perfect order.

2:38:31.100 --> 2:38:31.940
 That's hard.

2:38:31.940 --> 2:38:33.340
 I mean, it's a really powerful way to think

2:38:33.340 --> 2:38:34.500
 about those five minute chunks.

2:38:34.500 --> 2:38:36.820
 Just get one of them right in a day.

2:38:36.820 --> 2:38:39.400
 Yeah, well, if you do that for 200 days,

2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:40.660
 your life is in order.

2:38:41.980 --> 2:38:44.020
 You know, I thought I did that with my clients a lot.

2:38:44.020 --> 2:38:45.980
 So a lot of them would come home from work, the guys,

2:38:45.980 --> 2:38:47.980
 and their wife would meet them at the door

2:38:47.980 --> 2:38:49.980
 and it'd be a fight right away.

2:38:49.980 --> 2:38:51.180
 You know, and it's a clash there

2:38:51.180 --> 2:38:53.340
 cause he comes home and he's tired and hungry.

2:38:53.340 --> 2:38:54.180
 He's worked all day

2:38:54.180 --> 2:38:56.820
 and he's hoping that, you know, he gets welcomed

2:38:56.820 --> 2:38:58.020
 when he comes back to the home,

2:38:58.020 --> 2:38:59.900
 but then the wife is at home

2:38:59.900 --> 2:39:01.100
 and she's been with the kids all day

2:39:01.100 --> 2:39:02.100
 and she's tired and hungry

2:39:02.100 --> 2:39:03.460
 and she's hoping that when he comes home,

2:39:03.460 --> 2:39:05.860
 he'll show her some appreciation for what's happened today.

2:39:05.860 --> 2:39:08.260
 And then they clash and then they both have problems

2:39:08.260 --> 2:39:10.500
 to discuss cause they've had their troubles during the day.

2:39:10.500 --> 2:39:13.220
 And so then every time they get together,

2:39:13.220 --> 2:39:16.340
 they are not like it's a bit of a fight for 20 minutes.

2:39:16.340 --> 2:39:18.940
 And then the whole evening is screwed.

2:39:18.940 --> 2:39:21.840
 And so then you think, okay, here's the deal.

2:39:21.840 --> 2:39:25.000
 It's knock and the door will open.

2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:28.920
 Okay, you get to pick what happens when you come home,

2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:30.240
 but you have to figure out what it is.

2:39:30.240 --> 2:39:32.000
 So now this is the deal.

2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:33.920
 You treat yourself properly.

2:39:33.920 --> 2:39:35.320
 You imagine coming home

2:39:35.320 --> 2:39:38.600
 and it goes the way you want and need it to go.

2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:41.400
 Okay, what does that look like?

2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:42.240
 You get to have it,

2:39:42.240 --> 2:39:44.160
 but you have to know what it is.

2:39:44.160 --> 2:39:46.040
 What does it look like?

2:39:46.040 --> 2:39:48.080
 And you think, okay, I want to come home.

2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:50.040
 I want to be happy about coming home.

2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:53.560
 Come home. I open the door.

2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:56.020
 I say, hello, honey, I'm home.

2:39:56.020 --> 2:39:58.720
 My wife says, hi, it's so nice to hear your voice.

2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:02.400
 She comes up, she says, hi, dear.

2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:05.080
 She gives you a hug and she says, how was your day?

2:40:05.080 --> 2:40:07.360
 And you say, well, we'll sit and talk about that.

2:40:07.360 --> 2:40:08.680
 How was your day?

2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:10.520
 Well, we'll sit and talk about that.

2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:12.720
 Do you need something to eat?

2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:14.280
 Probably.

2:40:14.280 --> 2:40:16.240
 Let's go sit and talk about our day.

2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:18.120
 It's like, that sounds pretty good.

2:40:18.120 --> 2:40:20.000
 Okay, that sounds pretty good.

2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:20.840
 It might not be perfect,

2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:21.960
 but it sounds a hell of a lot better

2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:23.200
 than what we're doing now.

2:40:23.200 --> 2:40:26.240
 So how about we go talk to,

2:40:26.240 --> 2:40:29.280
 we'll go talk to your wife and say, okay,

2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:31.000
 this is what's happening when I come home.

2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:32.720
 I would like it to be better.

2:40:32.720 --> 2:40:34.320
 What would you like to have happen

2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:37.240
 if you could have what you wanted?

2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:39.480
 And so she sits down and she thinks, okay,

2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:41.480
 if he comes home, what do I want to have happen?

2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:44.160
 And then now you got two visions and you say,

2:40:44.160 --> 2:40:45.160
 well, what would you like?

2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:48.920
 And you listen and she says, what would you like?

2:40:48.920 --> 2:40:50.560
 And you tell her and then you think,

2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:53.320
 okay, now how can we bring these visions together?

2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:55.600
 So not only do we both get what we want,

2:40:55.600 --> 2:40:57.040
 but because we've brought them together,

2:40:57.040 --> 2:40:58.640
 we even get more than we want.

2:40:58.640 --> 2:40:59.960
 Well, who wouldn't agree to that

2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:01.920
 unless they were aiming down?

2:41:01.920 --> 2:41:02.840
 And that's so exciting.

2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:04.320
 It's not a compromise.

2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:06.520
 It's a union of ideals

2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:08.360
 that's even makes a better ideal.

2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:09.480
 And then you get to come home

2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:12.120
 and then there's another rule that goes along with that,

2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:15.760
 which is please, dear, have the grace

2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:19.680
 to allow me to do this stupidly and badly.

2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:23.160
 Well, I learned at least 20 times

2:41:23.160 --> 2:41:26.000
 and I'll give you the same leeway

2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:28.960
 and then we'll practice stupidly for 20 times

2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:30.360
 and we'll talk about it.

2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:32.040
 And then maybe we'll get it right

2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:35.520
 for the next 10,000 times, right?

2:41:35.520 --> 2:41:37.880
 And you can do that with your whole life

2:41:37.880 --> 2:41:39.160
 and you can do that with your kids

2:41:39.160 --> 2:41:40.880
 and you can do that with your family.

2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:42.560
 Like it's not easy, but you can do it.

2:41:42.560 --> 2:41:44.600
 It's a lot easier than the alternative.

2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:47.560
 Let me ask for some dating advice from Jordan Peterson.

2:41:47.560 --> 2:41:52.480
 How do you find on that topic the love of your life?

2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:54.520
 That's a good question.

2:41:54.520 --> 2:41:58.040
 I was asked that multiple times on my tour,

2:41:58.040 --> 2:41:59.560
 three times in a row in fact,

2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:02.880
 because we asked people to use this Slido gadget.

2:42:03.880 --> 2:42:05.040
 That's a popular question.

2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:07.240
 To vary, it always came up to the top.

2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:10.240
 And I got asked that three times in a row

2:42:10.240 --> 2:42:11.680
 and I didn't have a good answer.

2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:15.520
 And then I thought, why don't I have a good answer?

2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:17.880
 I thought, oh, I know why,

2:42:17.880 --> 2:42:19.640
 because that's a stupid question.

2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:25.400
 So why, why?

2:42:25.400 --> 2:42:27.880
 Because it's putting the cart before the horse.

2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:29.200
 Here's the right question.

2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:33.480
 How do I make myself into the perfect date?

2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:36.200
 You answer that question

2:42:36.200 --> 2:42:37.800
 and you will not have any problem

2:42:37.800 --> 2:42:39.080
 answering the previous question.

2:42:39.080 --> 2:42:41.960
 It's like, what do I want in a partner?

2:42:44.240 --> 2:42:46.280
 If I offered everything I could do a partner,

2:42:46.280 --> 2:42:47.920
 who would I be?

2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:49.120
 You work on that.

2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:50.640
 Ask that question, just ask.

2:42:50.640 --> 2:42:52.560
 Just ask yourself, okay,

2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:57.560
 I have to be the person that women would want.

2:42:59.360 --> 2:43:00.520
 Okay, what do they want?

2:43:02.520 --> 2:43:05.280
 Clean, that's not a bad start.

2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:06.600
 What do they want?

2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:10.600
 Reasonable, good physical shape.

2:43:12.040 --> 2:43:17.040
 So healthy, productive, generous, honest.

2:43:20.600 --> 2:43:22.360
 Willing to delay gratification.

2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:23.520
 So you dance with a woman.

2:43:23.520 --> 2:43:24.360
 It's like, what's she doing?

2:43:24.360 --> 2:43:25.360
 What are you two doing?

2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:27.120
 Well, it's a patterned,

2:43:27.120 --> 2:43:28.800
 there's patterns happening around you.

2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:31.000
 That's the music, patterns, patterns of being,

2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:32.440
 that's the music.

2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:34.800
 Now, can you align yourself with the patterns of being?

2:43:34.800 --> 2:43:36.440
 That's what she's checking out.

2:43:37.360 --> 2:43:40.400
 And then can you do that with her?

2:43:41.520 --> 2:43:45.400
 And then can you do that in a playful and attentive manner

2:43:45.400 --> 2:43:48.600
 and keep your bloody hands to yourself for at least a minute?

2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:52.880
 And so, can you dance in a playful manner?

2:43:52.880 --> 2:43:55.280
 It's like, you can go through this in your imagination

2:43:55.280 --> 2:43:58.040
 and you know, you'll know, you know.

2:43:58.040 --> 2:44:00.320
 And then you think, well, how far am I from those things?

2:44:00.320 --> 2:44:01.800
 And the answer is usually, man,

2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:06.600
 it's pretty horrible abyss separating you from that ideal.

2:44:06.600 --> 2:44:11.600
 But the harder you work on offering other people

2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:14.160
 what they need and want,

2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:16.960
 the more people will line up to play with you.

2:44:16.960 --> 2:44:18.360
 And so it's the wrong question.

2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:21.360
 It's like, how can I be the best partner possible?

2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:22.800
 And then you think, well, if I do that,

2:44:22.800 --> 2:44:25.360
 people will just take advantage of me.

2:44:25.360 --> 2:44:29.200
 And that's the non naive objection, right?

2:44:29.200 --> 2:44:30.320
 Because the naive person's saying,

2:44:30.320 --> 2:44:31.920
 well, I'll be good and everyone will treat me right.

2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:34.920
 It's like, the cynic says, no, I'll be good

2:44:34.920 --> 2:44:37.760
 and someone will take me out.

2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:40.960
 And then you think, well, what do you do

2:44:40.960 --> 2:44:42.080
 about that objection?

2:44:42.080 --> 2:44:45.720
 And the answer is, well, you factor that in.

2:44:45.720 --> 2:44:48.800
 And that's why you're supposed to be, what is it?

2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:51.320
 As soft as a dove and as wise as a serpent.

2:44:51.320 --> 2:44:54.360
 It's like, I know you're full of snakes.

2:44:54.360 --> 2:44:57.360
 I know it, maybe I know it more than you do.

2:44:57.360 --> 2:44:59.480
 But we'll play anyways.

2:44:59.480 --> 2:45:03.320
 And that's a good, that's right, voluntarily, right?

2:45:03.320 --> 2:45:05.680
 It's like, and what's so cool about that

2:45:05.680 --> 2:45:07.920
 is that even though the person you're dealing with

2:45:07.920 --> 2:45:12.120
 is full of snakes, if you offer your hand in trust

2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:15.760
 and it's real, you will evoke the best in them.

2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:17.840
 And that's true even, I've dealt with people

2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:22.840
 who were pretty damn criminal and pretty psychopathic

2:45:24.160 --> 2:45:26.720
 and sometimes dangerously so.

2:45:26.720 --> 2:45:29.520
 And you tread very lightly when you're dealing

2:45:29.520 --> 2:45:32.640
 with someone like that, especially if they're intoxicated.

2:45:32.640 --> 2:45:37.640
 And even then, your best bet is that alert trust.

2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:44.320
 It's the only, it's the fact that the only thing I know

2:45:44.320 --> 2:45:48.000
 that, look, I had one client who was a paranoid,

2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:49.960
 he was paranoid psychopath.

2:45:49.960 --> 2:45:51.800
 That's a bad combination.

2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:53.120
 He was a bad guy, man.

2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:55.280
 He had like four restraining orders.

2:45:55.280 --> 2:45:58.040
 Restraining orders on him.

2:45:58.040 --> 2:46:00.280
 And restraining orders don't work on the sort of people

2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:02.960
 that you put restraining orders on.

2:46:02.960 --> 2:46:06.120
 And he used to be harassed now and then by, you know,

2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:10.160
 a bureaucrat in a bank with delusions of power.

2:46:10.160 --> 2:46:13.200
 And he would say to them, he used to kind of act this out

2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:15.680
 to me when I was talking to him, he'd say,

2:46:17.320 --> 2:46:19.320
 I'm going to be your worst nightmare.

2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:22.160
 And he meant it.

2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:23.800
 And he would do it.

2:46:23.800 --> 2:46:27.680
 He had this obsessional psychopathic vengeance

2:46:27.680 --> 2:46:31.520
 that was just like right there, paranoid to the hilt

2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:34.120
 and paranoid people are hyper acute.

2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:38.600
 So they're watching you for any sign of deceit

2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:41.560
 or manipulation and they're really good at it.

2:46:41.560 --> 2:46:44.440
 Cause like they're 100%, that's what paranoia is.

2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:47.200
 It's 100% focus on that.

2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:49.840
 And even under those circumstances,

2:46:49.840 --> 2:46:54.840
 if you step carefully enough, you can maybe,

2:46:55.640 --> 2:46:57.200
 you can avoid the acts.

2:46:57.200 --> 2:46:58.160
 That's a good thing to know

2:46:58.160 --> 2:47:00.240
 if you ever meet someone truly dangerous.

2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:02.840
 Absolutely.

2:47:02.840 --> 2:47:05.480
 I believe in that, that being fragile,

2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:08.000
 nevertheless, taking that leap of trust

2:47:08.000 --> 2:47:10.200
 towards another person, even when they're dangerous,

2:47:10.200 --> 2:47:12.080
 especially when they're dangerous.

2:47:12.080 --> 2:47:15.960
 If you care, if there's something there

2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:18.400
 in those hills you want to find,

2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:21.360
 then that's probably the only way you're going to find it

2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:23.440
 is taking that risk.

2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:28.440
 I have to ask you about Gulag Archipelago by Sol Jnitsen

2:47:28.960 --> 2:47:30.360
 that speak to this very point.

2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:31.800
 There's so many layers of this book,

2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:34.040
 we could talk about it forever.

2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:38.080
 I'm sure in many ways we are talking about it forever.

2:47:38.080 --> 2:47:41.240
 But there is sort of one of the themes captured

2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:43.280
 in a few ways that was described to the book

2:47:43.280 --> 2:47:45.320
 is that line between good and evil

2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:48.560
 that runs through every human being.

2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:49.800
 As he writes,

2:47:51.120 --> 2:47:52.840
 the line dividing good and evil

2:47:52.840 --> 2:47:55.400
 cuts through the heart of every human being.

2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:57.520
 During the life of any heart,

2:47:57.520 --> 2:47:59.760
 this line keeps changing place.

2:47:59.760 --> 2:48:03.520
 Sometimes it is squeezed one way to exuberant evil

2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:06.120
 and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space

2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:07.720
 for good to flourish.

2:48:07.720 --> 2:48:10.880
 One and the same human being is at various ages

2:48:10.880 --> 2:48:12.720
 under various circumstances,

2:48:12.720 --> 2:48:15.000
 a totally different human being.

2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:17.600
 At times he's close to being a devil,

2:48:17.600 --> 2:48:20.040
 at times to sainthood,

2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:22.080
 but his name doesn't change.

2:48:22.080 --> 2:48:24.720
 And to that name we ascribe the whole lot,

2:48:24.720 --> 2:48:26.480
 good and evil.

2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:27.720
 What do you think about this line?

2:48:27.720 --> 2:48:30.200
 What do you think about this thing where we talked about

2:48:30.200 --> 2:48:31.800
 if you give somebody a chance,

2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:33.720
 you actually bring out the best in them?

2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:36.400
 What do you think about this other aspect

2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:41.400
 that throughout time that line shifts inside each person

2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:43.640
 and you get to define that shift?

2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:45.920
 What do you think about this line?

2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:47.600
 Are we all capable of evil?

2:48:48.680 --> 2:48:51.080
 Well, you know, the cosmic drama that's

2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:53.560
 Satan versus Christ.

2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:55.680
 It's like, well, who's that about?

2:48:55.680 --> 2:48:56.840
 If it's not about you.

2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:01.480
 I'm speaking just as a psychologist

2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:03.120
 or as a literary critic.

2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:04.320
 Those are characters.

2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:05.760
 At least they're that.

2:49:06.640 --> 2:49:08.960
 Well, are they human characters?

2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:10.640
 Well, obviously.

2:49:10.640 --> 2:49:13.760
 Well, are they archetypal human characters?

2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:14.680
 Yes.

2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:16.040
 What does that mean?

2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:18.480
 Cosmically and ontologically.

2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:19.680
 I don't know.

2:49:19.680 --> 2:49:21.040
 Is the world a story?

2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:23.320
 Maybe.

2:49:23.320 --> 2:49:24.640
 But the way stories are often told

2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:26.880
 is the characters embody a stable.

2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:28.200
 I know, those are unsophisticated.

2:49:28.200 --> 2:49:30.400
 Not great literature though.

2:49:30.400 --> 2:49:32.160
 It's very rare in great literature.

2:49:32.160 --> 2:49:33.920
 What you have in great literature generally

2:49:33.920 --> 2:49:35.560
 is the internal drama, right?

2:49:35.560 --> 2:49:40.560
 In, as the literature becomes more pop, I would say,

2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:42.960
 the characters are more unitary.

2:49:42.960 --> 2:49:44.920
 So there's a real bad guy and he's all bad

2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:47.960
 and there's a real good guy and he's all good.

2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:49.680
 And that's not as interesting.

2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:51.520
 It's not as sophisticated.

2:49:51.520 --> 2:49:53.560
 If when you reach Dostoevsky in heights

2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:56.760
 in literary representation or Shakespearean heights,

2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:00.840
 you can identify with the villain.

2:50:01.920 --> 2:50:05.440
 And that's when literature really reaches its pinnacle

2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:06.480
 in some sense.

2:50:06.480 --> 2:50:08.680
 And also the characters change throughout.

2:50:08.680 --> 2:50:09.520
 They shift throughout.

2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:11.320
 They're unpredictable throughout.

2:50:11.320 --> 2:50:14.560
 Taking the speaking of Russia more seriously recently.

2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:17.160
 And I've gotten to talk to translators of Dostoevsky

2:50:17.160 --> 2:50:22.160
 and Tolstoy and Chekhov and those kinds of folks.

2:50:22.160 --> 2:50:24.360
 And you get to, one of the mistakes

2:50:24.360 --> 2:50:26.800
 that translators made with Dostoevsky

2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:30.080
 for the longest time is they would,

2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:34.960
 quote unquote, fix the chaotic mess that is Dostoevsky.

2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:38.920
 Because there was a sense like he was too rushed

2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:40.000
 in his writing.

2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:41.720
 It seemed like there was tangents

2:50:41.720 --> 2:50:43.600
 that had nothing to do with anything.

2:50:43.600 --> 2:50:46.640
 The characters were unpredictable and not inconsistent.

2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:49.520
 There's parts of phrases that seem to be incomplete,

2:50:49.520 --> 2:50:50.520
 that kind of stuff.

2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:52.320
 And what they realized that is,

2:50:52.320 --> 2:50:55.320
 that's not, that's actually crafted that way.

2:50:55.320 --> 2:50:58.600
 It's not, it's like editing James Joyce,

2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:00.040
 like Finnegan's Wake or something

2:51:00.040 --> 2:51:01.800
 because it doesn't make any sense.

2:51:01.800 --> 2:51:03.760
 They realized that that is the magic of it.

2:51:03.760 --> 2:51:06.000
 That captures the humanity of these characters

2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:07.160
 that they are unpredictable.

2:51:07.160 --> 2:51:08.840
 They change throughout time.

2:51:08.840 --> 2:51:11.280
 There's a bunch of contradictions.

2:51:11.280 --> 2:51:13.920
 On which point I got to ask, is there a case to be made

2:51:13.920 --> 2:51:18.000
 that Brothers Karamazov is the greatest book ever written?

2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.200
 Yeah, there is a case to be made for that.

2:51:20.200 --> 2:51:23.040
 I don't know, is it better than Crime and Punishment?

2:51:23.040 --> 2:51:24.000
 Yes, yeah.

2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:24.880
 You think so?

2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:26.760
 Why do you, I'm not arguing with it.

2:51:26.760 --> 2:51:28.080
 Why do you think that?

2:51:28.080 --> 2:51:30.440
 Well, every book is a personal.

2:51:30.440 --> 2:51:32.800
 Some of my best friends are inside that book.

2:51:32.800 --> 2:51:34.080
 Yeah, it's an amazing book.

2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:35.720
 I mean, there's no doubt about it.

2:51:35.720 --> 2:51:39.920
 I think it's, some books are defined

2:51:39.920 --> 2:51:41.360
 by your personal relationship with them.

2:51:41.360 --> 2:51:42.600
 And that one was definitive.

2:51:42.600 --> 2:51:44.680
 And I almost graduated to that one

2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:46.600
 because for the longest time,

2:51:46.600 --> 2:51:51.360
 The Idiot was my favorite book of all.

2:51:51.360 --> 2:51:54.720
 Because I identified with the ideas represented

2:51:54.720 --> 2:51:55.680
 by Prince Mishkin.

2:51:55.680 --> 2:51:56.720
 I also identified.

2:51:56.720 --> 2:51:58.200
 Ah, that's interesting.

2:51:58.200 --> 2:52:00.560
 To Prince Mishkin as a human being.

2:52:00.560 --> 2:52:01.600
 The Holy Fool.

2:52:01.600 --> 2:52:04.520
 The Fool, because the world kind of,

2:52:04.520 --> 2:52:07.280
 my whole life still kind of sees me,

2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:08.680
 saw me in my perception.

2:52:08.680 --> 2:52:12.880
 My narrow perception is kind of the Fool.

2:52:12.880 --> 2:52:17.640
 And I, different from the interpretation

2:52:17.640 --> 2:52:19.880
 that a lot of people take of this book,

2:52:19.880 --> 2:52:21.880
 I see him as a kind of hero.

2:52:21.880 --> 2:52:26.800
 To be, to be a naive, quote unquote, Fool,

2:52:26.800 --> 2:52:29.920
 but really just a naive optimist.

2:52:29.920 --> 2:52:31.800
 And naive in the best possible way.

2:52:31.800 --> 2:52:33.200
 I do believe that.

2:52:33.200 --> 2:52:34.560
 That's childlike.

2:52:34.560 --> 2:52:36.280
 Yeah, childlike is a butter.

2:52:36.280 --> 2:52:38.480
 So naive is usually seen as.

2:52:38.480 --> 2:52:39.720
 That's childish, naive.

2:52:39.720 --> 2:52:42.600
 Yeah, but childlike.

2:52:42.600 --> 2:52:45.360
 That's why no one enters the kingdom of heaven

2:52:45.360 --> 2:52:48.080
 unless they become like a child.

2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:49.280
 That's Prince Mishkin.

2:52:49.280 --> 2:52:51.000
 Dusty Efsky knew that.

2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:52.360
 So that's why you liked The Idiot.

2:52:52.360 --> 2:52:53.720
 That's so interesting.

2:52:53.720 --> 2:52:55.440
 See, I think I like Kremlin punishment

2:52:55.440 --> 2:52:57.280
 because while you identified with Mishkin,

2:52:57.280 --> 2:52:59.800
 I think I identified more with Raskolnikov.

2:52:59.800 --> 2:53:02.560
 Cause I was tempted by Luciferian intellect, you know,

2:53:02.560 --> 2:53:06.280
 in the manner that, in a manner very similar

2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:07.880
 to the manner he was tempted.

2:53:07.880 --> 2:53:10.600
 But I mean, I think, I think you can make a case

2:53:10.600 --> 2:53:12.720
 that the brothers Karamazov is,

2:53:12.720 --> 2:53:15.240
 Dusty Efsky's crowning achievement.

2:53:15.240 --> 2:53:16.080
 Well.

2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:16.920
 And that's something, man.

2:53:16.920 --> 2:53:18.600
 He ruined literature for me.

2:53:20.400 --> 2:53:22.720
 Cause everything else just felt insipid afterwards.

2:53:22.720 --> 2:53:24.120
 Not everything.

2:53:24.120 --> 2:53:25.480
 Not everything.

2:53:25.480 --> 2:53:30.480
 I found some books that in my experience hit that pinnacle.

2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:35.440
 The Master in Margarita, that's a deadly book.

2:53:35.440 --> 2:53:36.960
 I've read that, I think four times

2:53:36.960 --> 2:53:40.120
 and I still, there's still, it's unbelievably deep.

2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:43.480
 There's a Nikos Kazansikas, a Greek writer.

2:53:44.480 --> 2:53:48.920
 Some of his books are, his writing is amazing as well.

2:53:48.920 --> 2:53:50.920
 Did you ever connect with the literary

2:53:50.920 --> 2:53:55.840
 like existentialist Kamu or people like Harman Hesse

2:53:55.840 --> 2:54:00.400
 or even Kafka, did you ever connect with those?

2:54:00.400 --> 2:54:01.400
 To the same degree?

2:54:01.400 --> 2:54:02.240
 Yeah, to the same.

2:54:02.240 --> 2:54:05.240
 Enough to be an influence, you know,

2:54:05.240 --> 2:54:08.400
 you have to be deaf in some fundamental sense

2:54:08.400 --> 2:54:12.640
 not to encounters a great dead friend and fail to learn.

2:54:13.920 --> 2:54:16.440
 And I mean, I tried to separate the wheat from the chaff

2:54:16.440 --> 2:54:19.520
 when I read, you know, and I read all the great clinicians,

2:54:19.520 --> 2:54:21.280
 all of them, perhaps not.

2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:25.360
 Those who are foremost in the pantheon

2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:28.080
 and I tried to pull out what I could and that was a lot.

2:54:28.080 --> 2:54:31.200
 I learned a lot from Freud, I learned a lot from Rogers

2:54:31.200 --> 2:54:33.920
 and I learned a lot from, well, from Dostoevsky and Nietzsche.

2:54:33.920 --> 2:54:36.160
 I'm gonna do a course on Dostoevsky and Nietzsche

2:54:36.160 --> 2:54:39.280
 for this Peterson Academy, this is coming up in January.

2:54:39.280 --> 2:54:41.920
 Oh, that'll be, I'm really looking forward to it.

2:54:41.920 --> 2:54:44.000
 You're weaving.

2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:45.960
 I hadn't thought about doing them together.

2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:48.040
 That'd be fun, that's a good idea.

2:54:48.040 --> 2:54:50.640
 That'd be a good idea.

2:54:50.640 --> 2:54:53.160
 There's an interesting idea.

2:54:53.160 --> 2:54:55.440
 You often weave them together really masterfully

2:54:55.440 --> 2:54:59.760
 because there is a, there is religious

2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:01.360
 in the broad sense of that word,

2:55:01.360 --> 2:55:03.680
 themes throughout the writing of both.

2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:05.720
 Yeah, well, there is uncanny parallelisms

2:55:05.720 --> 2:55:07.920
 in their writing and their lives.

2:55:07.920 --> 2:55:12.240
 So, and Dostoevsky's deeper than Nietzsche,

2:55:12.240 --> 2:55:15.640
 but that's because he was a writer of fiction.

2:55:15.640 --> 2:55:17.960
 Nietzsche is almost a character in a Dostoevsky book.

2:55:17.960 --> 2:55:21.640
 He is definitely that, he is definitely that, yes.

2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:24.720
 And apparently Nietzsche knew more about Dostoevsky

2:55:24.720 --> 2:55:25.640
 than people had thought.

2:55:25.640 --> 2:55:27.840
 There's been some recent scholarship on that grounds.

2:55:27.840 --> 2:55:29.640
 Dostoevsky didn't know anything about Nietzsche

2:55:29.640 --> 2:55:32.240
 as far as I know, I could be wrong about that.

2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:35.200
 But the thing that Dostoevsky had over Nietzsche

2:55:35.200 --> 2:55:37.560
 is Nietzsche had to make things propositional

2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:39.440
 in some real sense, because he was a philosopher.

2:55:39.440 --> 2:55:42.320
 And it's hard to propositionize things

2:55:42.320 --> 2:55:46.400
 that are outside your ken, but you can characterize them.

2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:49.320
 And so in the Brothers Karamazov,

2:55:49.320 --> 2:55:54.160
 Ivan is a more developed character than Aleosha.

2:55:54.160 --> 2:55:58.080
 In the explicit sense, he can make better arguments.

2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:01.280
 But Aleosha wins, like Mishkin,

2:56:01.280 --> 2:56:02.880
 because he's the better man.

2:56:02.880 --> 2:56:06.880
 And Dostoevsky can show that in the actions, right?

2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:08.800
 He can't render it entirely propositional,

2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:10.240
 but that's probably because what's good

2:56:10.240 --> 2:56:12.720
 can't be rendered entirely propositional.

2:56:12.720 --> 2:56:14.800
 And so Dostoevsky had that edge over Nietzsche.

2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:17.440
 He said, well, Ivan is this brilliant rationalist,

2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:21.440
 atheist, materialist, and puts forward an argument

2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:23.400
 on that front that's still unparalleled

2:56:23.400 --> 2:56:26.800
 as far as I'm concerned, and overwhelms Aleosha,

2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:30.840
 who cannot respond, but Aleosha is still the better man.

2:56:30.840 --> 2:56:33.080
 So, which is very interesting, you know, that.

2:56:33.080 --> 2:56:35.880
 What, you know, the funny thing about those two characters

2:56:35.880 --> 2:56:39.640
 is you, Jordan Peterson, seem to be somebody

2:56:39.640 --> 2:56:42.560
 that at least in part embodies both,

2:56:42.560 --> 2:56:45.680
 because you are one of the intellectuals of our time,

2:56:45.680 --> 2:56:50.000
 rigorous in thought, but also are able to have

2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:52.760
 that kind of, what would you describe?

2:56:52.760 --> 2:56:56.000
 If you remove the religiosity of Aleosha,

2:56:56.920 --> 2:56:59.720
 there's a, what's a good word?

2:56:59.720 --> 2:57:00.880
 Love towards the world.

2:57:00.880 --> 2:57:02.960
 Spirit of encouragement.

2:57:02.960 --> 2:57:04.440
 Yes.

2:57:04.440 --> 2:57:08.120
 Well, it's, you know, one of the things I did learn,

2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:10.760
 perhaps, from looking into the abyss to the degree

2:57:10.760 --> 2:57:14.840
 that I have had to, or was willing to,

2:57:16.080 --> 2:57:18.000
 was that at some level, you have to make

2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:20.560
 a fundamental statement of faith.

2:57:20.560 --> 2:57:23.080
 When God creates the world, after each day,

2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:25.640
 he says, he saw that it was good.

2:57:26.600 --> 2:57:28.120
 You think, well, is it good?

2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:29.920
 It's like, well, there's a tough question.

2:57:29.920 --> 2:57:31.800
 I mean, you know, do you want to bring a child

2:57:31.800 --> 2:57:35.040
 into a world such as this, which is a fundamental question

2:57:35.040 --> 2:57:36.440
 of whether or not it's good?

2:57:36.440 --> 2:57:40.360
 It's an act of faith to declare that it's good,

2:57:41.280 --> 2:57:43.200
 because the evidence is ambivalent.

2:57:44.480 --> 2:57:46.400
 And so then you think, okay, well,

2:57:47.960 --> 2:57:49.720
 am I going to act as if it's good?

2:57:51.200 --> 2:57:53.360
 And what would happen if I did?

2:57:53.360 --> 2:57:56.960
 And maybe the answer to that is, I think this is the answer.

2:57:56.960 --> 2:58:01.960
 The more you act out the proposition that it's good,

2:58:08.400 --> 2:58:09.400
 the better it gets.

2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:14.800
 And so that's, Dostoevsky said, this is something else.

2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:17.680
 Every man is not only responsible for everything he does,

2:58:17.680 --> 2:58:20.120
 but for everything everyone else does.

2:58:20.120 --> 2:58:24.960
 It's like, what, is that profound, or are you just insane?

2:58:24.960 --> 2:58:29.120
 Then you think, is what you receive back

2:58:29.120 --> 2:58:30.760
 proportionate to what you deliver?

2:58:31.920 --> 2:58:34.360
 And the answer to that might be yes.

2:58:34.360 --> 2:58:36.760
 That's a terrifying idea, man.

2:58:36.760 --> 2:58:39.320
 And it's certainly, you can see that it's true in some sense

2:58:39.320 --> 2:58:44.320
 because people certainly respond to you in kind

2:58:44.440 --> 2:58:45.640
 with how you treat them.

2:58:45.640 --> 2:58:46.840
 That's certainly the case.

2:58:46.840 --> 2:58:49.720
 I mean, it's terrifying and it's exciting.

2:58:49.720 --> 2:58:51.360
 Yeah, right.

2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:52.880
 But that's an adventure, isn't it?

2:58:52.880 --> 2:58:57.880
 You create the world by the way you live it.

2:59:00.680 --> 2:59:03.360
 The world you experience is defined

2:59:03.360 --> 2:59:05.080
 by the way you live that world.

2:59:05.080 --> 2:59:06.880
 And that's really interesting.

2:59:06.880 --> 2:59:08.440
 And then taken as a collective,

2:59:08.440 --> 2:59:10.720
 we create the world together in that way.

2:59:10.720 --> 2:59:12.880
 What do you think is the meaning of it all?

2:59:12.880 --> 2:59:15.720
 What's the meaning of life, Jordan Peterson?

2:59:15.720 --> 2:59:18.120
 We've defined it many, many times

2:59:18.120 --> 2:59:19.120
 throughout this conversation.

2:59:19.120 --> 2:59:21.040
 It's the adventure along the route, man.

2:59:21.040 --> 2:59:26.040
 And I would say, where's that adventure to be found?

2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:29.840
 In faith, what's the faith?

2:59:29.840 --> 2:59:32.880
 The highest value is love and truth is it's handmade.

2:59:35.160 --> 2:59:36.880
 That's a statement of faith, right?

2:59:36.880 --> 2:59:38.280
 Because you can't tell.

2:59:39.600 --> 2:59:42.720
 You have to act it out to see if it's true.

2:59:43.640 --> 2:59:46.320
 And so you can't even find out without,

2:59:46.320 --> 2:59:47.920
 and that's so peculiar,

2:59:47.920 --> 2:59:50.800
 you have to make the commitment a priority.

2:59:50.800 --> 2:59:53.640
 It's like a marriage, it's the same thing.

2:59:53.640 --> 2:59:56.800
 It's like, well, is this the person for me?

2:59:56.800 --> 2:59:58.080
 That's the wrong question.

2:59:59.440 --> 3:00:01.840
 How do I find out if this is the person for me?

3:00:03.000 --> 3:00:05.240
 By binding myself to them.

3:00:07.160 --> 3:00:09.280
 Well, maybe the same thing is true of life, right?

3:00:09.280 --> 3:00:10.680
 You bind yourself to it.

3:00:11.560 --> 3:00:13.440
 And that tighter you bind yourself to it,

3:00:13.440 --> 3:00:15.640
 the more you find out what it is.

3:00:15.640 --> 3:00:18.040
 And that's like a radical embrace.

3:00:18.040 --> 3:00:20.000
 And it's a really radical embrace.

3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:22.040
 That's the crucifix symbol and more than that,

3:00:22.040 --> 3:00:27.040
 because like I said, the full passion story isn't death.

3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:29.280
 It isn't even unjust death.

3:00:29.280 --> 3:00:31.440
 It isn't even unjust death

3:00:31.440 --> 3:00:34.160
 and the crucifixion of the innocent,

3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:36.440
 which is really getting pretty bad.

3:00:36.440 --> 3:00:41.440
 It's unjust, torturous, innocent death,

3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:47.400
 attendant upon betrayal and tyranny, followed by hell.

3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:51.480
 Well, that's a hell of a thing to radically embrace.

3:00:51.480 --> 3:00:52.640
 It's like, bring it on.

3:00:54.200 --> 3:00:58.760
 I think a lot of people put truth as the highest ideal

3:00:58.760 --> 3:01:03.760
 and think they can get to that ideal

3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:05.960
 while living in a place of cynicism

3:01:05.960 --> 3:01:07.760
 and ultimately escape from life

3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:10.080
 and hiding from life, afraid of life.

3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:14.000
 And it's as beautifully put that love

3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:16.880
 is the highest ideal to reach for

3:01:16.880 --> 3:01:18.120
 and truth is.

3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:19.080
 It's handmade.

3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:21.080
 I thought about that for a long time, right?

3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:23.040
 This hierarchy of ideal.

3:01:23.040 --> 3:01:25.120
 And the thing about truth, that bitter truth,

3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:26.560
 let's say, that cynical truth,

3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:31.160
 is it can break the shackles of naivety.

3:01:31.160 --> 3:01:34.440
 And actually a burnt cynicism

3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:38.920
 is a moral improvement over a blind naivety,

3:01:39.920 --> 3:01:42.560
 even though one is in some ways positive,

3:01:42.560 --> 3:01:44.200
 but only because it's protected

3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:46.320
 and the other is bitter and dark,

3:01:46.320 --> 3:01:48.040
 but still better.

3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:49.480
 But you're not done at that point.

3:01:49.480 --> 3:01:51.320
 You're just barely started.

3:01:51.320 --> 3:01:53.080
 It's like you're cynical.

3:01:53.080 --> 3:01:54.440
 You're not cynical enough.

3:01:55.520 --> 3:01:57.080
 It's like, how cynical are you?

3:01:57.080 --> 3:02:00.920
 Are you, I'm an Auschwitz prison guard level of cynical?

3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:03.440
 Cause you have to be,

3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:05.560
 you have to go down pretty deep into the weeds

3:02:05.560 --> 3:02:07.200
 before you find that part of you.

3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:09.440
 But you can find it if you want.

3:02:09.440 --> 3:02:11.800
 And then you think, well, I wanna stop this.

3:02:13.040 --> 3:02:15.040
 Well, that was the question you posed in some sense.

3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:16.640
 You're obsessed with, say, what happened

3:02:16.640 --> 3:02:19.160
 on these mass scale catastrophes

3:02:20.240 --> 3:02:21.360
 in the communist countries.

3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:24.680
 It's like, well, millions of people participated.

3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:28.960
 So you could have, and maybe you would have enjoyed it.

3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:30.960
 So what part of that is you?

3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:33.480
 And you can find it if you want.

3:02:34.800 --> 3:02:36.160
 Yeah, it's all there.

3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:39.160
 The prisoner, the interrogator, the...

3:02:39.160 --> 3:02:42.680
 The Judas Pontius pilot.

3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:43.520
 All of it.

3:02:43.520 --> 3:02:46.160
 And it's all of it is inside us.

3:02:46.160 --> 3:02:47.000
 Yeah.

3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:48.840
 And you just have to look.

3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:52.680
 And once you do, maybe eventually you can find the love.

3:02:52.680 --> 3:02:54.560
 Jordan, you're an incredible human being.

3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:56.960
 I'm deeply honored that you would talk to me.

3:02:56.960 --> 3:02:59.720
 Thank you for being a truth seeker in this world.

3:02:59.720 --> 3:03:01.520
 And thank you for the love.

3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:04.040

 And now let me leave you some words from Friedrich Nietzsche.

3:03:16.080 --> 3:03:18.120
 You must have chaos within you

3:03:18.120 --> 3:03:20.400
 to give birth to a dancing star.

3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:42.400
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
