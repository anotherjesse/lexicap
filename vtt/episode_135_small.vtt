00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
 The following is a conversation with Charles Isbell,

00:03.120 --> 00:06.320
 Dean of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech,

00:06.320 --> 00:10.720
 a researcher and educator in the field of artificial intelligence,

00:10.720 --> 00:14.320
 and someone who deeply thinks about what exactly

00:14.320 --> 00:18.000
 is the field of computing and how do we teach it.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.640
 He also has a fascinatingly varied set of interests, including music,

00:22.640 --> 00:28.160
 books, movies, sports, and history. They make him especially fun to talk with.

00:28.160 --> 00:32.880
 When I first saw him speak, his charisma immediately took over the room,

00:32.880 --> 00:35.680
 and I had a stupid, excited smile on my face,

00:35.680 --> 00:39.360
 and I knew I had to eventually talk to him on this podcast.

00:39.360 --> 00:44.320
 Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:44.320 --> 00:48.800
 First is Neuro, the maker of functional sugar free gum and mints

00:48.800 --> 00:52.320
 that I use to give my brain a quick caffeine boost.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.960
 Second is Decoding Digital, a podcast on tech and entrepreneurship

00:56.960 --> 01:00.560
 that I listen to and enjoy. Third is Masterclass,

01:00.560 --> 01:04.960
 online courses that I watch from some of the most amazing humans in history.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.560
 And finally, Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends

01:08.560 --> 01:12.080
 for food and drinks. Please check out these sponsors

01:12.080 --> 01:16.240
 in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.

01:16.240 --> 01:19.440
 As a side note, let me say that I'm trying to make it so that the

01:19.440 --> 01:23.280
 conversations with Charles, Eric Weinstein, and Dan Carlin

01:23.280 --> 01:28.160
 will be published before Americans vote for president on November 3rd.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.360
 There's nothing explicitly political in these conversations,

01:31.360 --> 01:34.400
 but they do touch on something in human nature

01:34.400 --> 01:37.840
 that I hope can bring context to our difficult time.

01:37.840 --> 01:43.200
 And maybe, for a moment, allow us to empathize with people we disagree with.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.840
 With Eric, we talk about the nature of evil.

01:45.840 --> 01:51.440
 With Charles, besides AI and music, we talk a bit about race in America

01:51.440 --> 01:54.800
 and how we can bring more love and empathy to

01:54.800 --> 01:58.640
 our online communication. And with Dan Carlin,

01:58.640 --> 02:02.960
 well, we talk about Alexander the Great, Jengas Khan,

02:02.960 --> 02:07.840
 Hitler, Stalin, and all the complicated parts of human history in between,

02:07.840 --> 02:11.440
 with a hopeful eye toward a brighter future for our humble

02:11.440 --> 02:15.280
 little civilization here on Earth. The conversation with Dan

02:15.280 --> 02:20.160
 will hopefully be posted tomorrow on Monday, November 2nd.

 And now, here's my conversation with Charles Isbell.

02:36.080 --> 02:40.960
 You've mentioned that you love movies and TV shows.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.640
 Let's ask an easy question, but you have to be definitively,

02:44.640 --> 02:49.760
 objectively conclusive. What's your top three movies of all time?

02:49.760 --> 02:53.040
 So, you're asking me to be definitive and to be conclusive. That's a little hard.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.800
 I'm going to tell you why. It's very simple. It's because

02:56.800 --> 03:00.560
 movies is too broad of a category. I got to pick subgenres, but I will tell you

03:00.560 --> 03:04.080
 that of those genres, I'll pick one or two for me to the genres.

03:04.080 --> 03:08.080
 I'll get us to three, sometimes I'm going to cheat. So, my favorite

03:08.080 --> 03:12.000
 comedy of all times, which probably my favorite movie of all time,

03:12.000 --> 03:16.640
 is His Girl Friday, which is probably a movie that you've not ever heard of, but

03:16.640 --> 03:22.400
 it's based on a play called The Front Page from, I don't know, early 1900s.

03:22.400 --> 03:28.160
 And the movie is a fantastic film. What's the story? What's the independent film?

03:28.160 --> 03:31.440
 No, no, no. What are we talking about? This is one of the movies that would

03:31.440 --> 03:33.440
 have been very popular. It's a screwball comedy. Have you ever

03:33.440 --> 03:35.840
 seen Moonlighting, the TV show? You know what I'm talking about?

03:35.840 --> 03:38.720
 So, you've seen these shows where there's a man and a woman,

03:38.720 --> 03:41.360
 and they clearly are in love with one another, and they're constantly fighting

03:41.360 --> 03:43.120
 and always talking over each other. Yeah.

03:43.120 --> 03:47.440
 Banter, banter, banter, banter, banter. This was the movie that started all that,

03:47.440 --> 03:50.640
 as far as I'm concerned. It's very much of its time, so it's,

03:51.680 --> 03:56.400
 I don't know, it must have come out sometime between 1934 and 1939. I'm not sure exactly when

03:56.400 --> 04:01.200
 the movie itself came out. It's black and white. It's just a fantastic

04:01.200 --> 04:03.360
 film. It is hilarious. It's just most of the conversation.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.880
 Not entirely, but mostly, mostly. Just a lot of back and forth. There's a story there.

04:08.880 --> 04:15.600
 Someone's on death row, and they're newspaper men, including her. They're all newspaper men.

04:16.240 --> 04:21.600
 They were divorced. The editor, the publisher, I guess, and the reporter, they were divorced,

04:22.400 --> 04:26.240
 but they clearly, he's thinking, trying to get back together, and there's this whole other

04:26.240 --> 04:28.800
 thing that's going on, but none of that matters. The plot doesn't matter.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.520
 Yeah. There's just total play in conversation.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.680
 It's fantastic, and I just love everything about the conversation, because at the end of the day,

04:35.680 --> 04:39.680
 sort of narrative and conversation are the sort of things that drive me, and so I really like

04:39.680 --> 04:43.680
 that movie for that reason. Similarly, I'm now going to cheat, and I'm going to give you two

04:43.680 --> 04:50.800
 movies as one, and they're Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and John Wick, both relatively modern.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.640
 John Wick, of course. One, two, or three.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.520
 One. I love them all for different reasons, and they're increasingly more ridiculous,

04:57.520 --> 05:01.600
 kind of like loving alien and aliens, despite the fact they're two completely different movies.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.080
 But the reason I put Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and John Wick together is because I

05:06.080 --> 05:09.760
 actually think they're the same movie, or what I like about them, the same movie,

05:09.760 --> 05:16.480
 which is both of them create a world that you're coming in the middle of, and they don't explain

05:16.480 --> 05:21.600
 it to you, but the story is done so well that you pick it up. So anyone who's seen John Wick,

05:21.600 --> 05:25.360
 you know, you have these little coins, and they're headed out, and there are these

05:25.360 --> 05:28.240
 rules, and apparently every single person in New York City is an assassin.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.680
 There's like two people who come through who aren't, but otherwise they are. But there's

05:31.680 --> 05:35.200
 this complicated world, and everyone knows each other, they don't sit down and explain it to you,

05:35.200 --> 05:38.720
 but you figure it out. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a lot like that. You get the feeling

05:38.720 --> 05:43.280
 that this is chapter nine of a 10 part story, and you've missed the first eight chapters,

05:43.280 --> 05:46.000
 and they're not going to explain it to you, but there's this sort of rich world behind you.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.280
 You get pulled in anyway, like immediately.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.800
 You get pulled in anyway. So it's just excellent storytelling in both cases,

05:50.800 --> 05:51.840
 and very, very different.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.480
 And also you like the outfit, I assume, the John Wick outfit?

05:54.480 --> 05:58.000
 Oh yeah, of course. Well, of course. Yes. I think John Wick outfit first.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.760
 And so that's number two. And then...

05:59.760 --> 06:03.920
 But sorry to pause on that, Martial Arts. You have a long list of hobbies,

06:03.920 --> 06:07.680
 like it scrolls off the page, but I didn't see Martial Arts as one of them.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.240
 I do not do Martial Arts, but I certainly watch Martial Arts.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.680
 Oh, I appreciate it very much. Oh, we could talk about every Jackie Chan movie I've ever made.

06:13.680 --> 06:14.000
 Okay.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.680
 And I would be on board with that.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.880
 The Couch Hour 2, like that kind of comedy of a cop?

06:18.880 --> 06:22.160
 Yes, yes. By the way, my favorite Jackie Chan movie would be

06:22.160 --> 06:27.600
 Drunken Master 2, known in the States usually as Legend of the Drunken Master.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.360
 Actually, Drunken Master, the first one is the first Kung Fu movie I ever saw,

06:33.360 --> 06:34.320
 but I did not know that.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.920
 The first Jackie Chan movie?

06:35.920 --> 06:38.000
 No, first one ever that I saw on Remember.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.840
 But I had no idea that that's what it was, and I didn't know that was Jackie Chan.

06:41.840 --> 06:46.320
 That was like his first major movie. I was a kid. It was done in the 70s.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.600
 I only later rediscovered that it was actually...

06:49.600 --> 06:52.320
 And he creates his own martial art by drinking.

06:52.320 --> 06:57.360
 Was he actually drinking or was he played drinking?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.520
 You mean as an actor or?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.680
 No, I'm sure as an actor.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.160
 No, he was 70s or whatever.

07:04.160 --> 07:09.120
 He was definitely drinking, and in the end, he drinks industrial grade alcohol.

07:10.000 --> 07:10.480
 Yeah.

07:10.480 --> 07:15.040
 Yeah, and has one of the most fantastic fights ever in that subgenre.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.080
 Anyway, that's my favorite one of his movies, but I'll tell you the last movie

07:18.080 --> 07:22.880
 is actually a movie called Nothing but a Man, which is the 1960s.

07:23.680 --> 07:31.840
 Start Ivan Dixon, who you'll know from Hogan's Heroes and Abby Lincoln.

07:31.840 --> 07:35.040
 It's just a really small little drama. It's a beautiful story,

07:35.040 --> 07:36.880
 but my favorite scene, so I'm cheating.

07:36.880 --> 07:42.000
 My favorite, one of my favorite movies just for the ending is The Godfather.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.520
 I think the last scene of that is just fantastic.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.400
 It's the whole movie all summarized in just eight, nine seconds.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.440
 Godfather, part one?

07:49.440 --> 07:50.240
 Part one.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.280
 How does it end?

07:51.280 --> 07:54.880
 I don't think you need to worry about spoilers if you haven't seen The Godfather.

07:54.880 --> 07:55.680
 Spoiler alert.

07:55.680 --> 08:01.920
 It ends with the wife coming to Michael, and he says,

08:01.920 --> 08:04.000
 just this once, I'll let you ask me my business.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.760
 And she asks him if he did this terrible thing, and he looks her in the eye and he lies,

08:07.760 --> 08:09.120
 and he says, no.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.000
 And she says, thank you.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.920
 And she walks out the door, and you see him, you see her going out of the door,

08:17.920 --> 08:21.680
 and all these people are coming in, and they're kissing Michael's hands,

08:21.680 --> 08:22.720
 and Godfather.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.360
 And then the camera switches perspective.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.920
 So instead of looking at him, you're looking at her,

08:29.120 --> 08:32.320
 and the door closes in her face, and that's the end of the movie.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.480
 And that's the whole movie right there.

08:34.480 --> 08:38.000
 Do you see parallels between that and your position as Dean at Georgia Tech Chrome?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.080
 I'm just kidding, a trick question.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.640
 Sometimes, certainly, the door gets closed on me every once in a while.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.280
 Okay, that was a rhetorical question.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
 You've also mentioned that you, I think, enjoy all kinds of experiments, including on yourself,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
 but I saw a video where you said you did an experiment where you tracked all kinds of

08:58.000 --> 09:04.640
 information about yourself, and a few others, sort of wiring up your home.

09:04.640 --> 09:09.200
 And this little idea that you mentioned in that video, which is kind of interesting,

09:09.200 --> 09:16.560
 that you thought that two days worth of data is enough to capture majority of the behavior

09:16.560 --> 09:17.440
 of the human being.

09:18.960 --> 09:23.200
 First, can you describe what the heck you did to collect all that data?

09:23.200 --> 09:26.720
 Because it's fascinating, just like little details of how you collect that data,

09:26.720 --> 09:29.840
 and also what your intuition behind the two days is.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.680
 So first off, it has to be the right two days, but I was thinking of a very specific

09:33.680 --> 09:36.720
 experiment. There's actually a suite of them that I've been a part of, and other people

09:36.720 --> 09:39.760
 have done this. Of course, I just sort of dabbled in that part of the world.

09:39.760 --> 09:44.320
 But to be very clear, the specific thing that I was talking about had to do with recording

09:44.320 --> 09:47.920
 all the IR going on in my, infrared going on in my house.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.520
 So this is a long time ago.

09:49.520 --> 09:54.720
 So this is everything's being curled by pressing buttons on remote controls as opposed to speaking

09:54.720 --> 09:57.120
 to Alexa or Siri or someone like that.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.960
 And I was just trying to figure out if you could get enough data on people to figure out

10:00.960 --> 10:03.760
 what they were going to do with their TVs or their lights.

10:03.760 --> 10:08.400
 My house was completely wired up at the time, which, you know, what I'm about to look at

10:08.400 --> 10:11.360
 a movie or I'm about to turn on the TV or whatever and just see what I could predict

10:11.360 --> 10:15.040
 from it. It was kind of surprising.

10:15.040 --> 10:18.320
 It shouldn't have been, but that's all very easy to do, by the way, just capturing all

10:18.320 --> 10:20.080
 the little stuff. I mean, it's a bunch of computer systems.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.200
 It's really easy to capture the day, if you know what you're looking for at Georgia Tech

10:23.200 --> 10:26.640
 Long before I got there, we had this thing called the aware home where everything was

10:26.640 --> 10:29.200
 wired up and you captured everything that was going on.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.800
 Nothing even difficult, not with video or anything like that, just the way that the

10:32.800 --> 10:35.440
 system was just capturing everything.

10:35.440 --> 10:40.640
 So it turns out that, and I did this with myself and then I had students and they worked

10:40.640 --> 10:45.680
 with many other people, and it turns out at the end of the day, people do the same things

10:45.680 --> 10:47.840
 over and over and over again.

10:47.840 --> 10:51.360
 So it has to be the right two days, like a weekend, but it turns out not only can you

10:51.360 --> 10:54.880
 predict what someone's going to do next at the level of what button they're going to

10:54.880 --> 11:00.480
 press next on a remote control, but you can do it with something really, really simple,

11:00.480 --> 11:02.480
 like a, you don't even need a hidden markoff model.

11:02.480 --> 11:06.240
 It's like a mark, just simply, I press this, this is my prediction of the next thing.

11:06.240 --> 11:11.680
 It turns out you can get 93% accuracy just by doing something very simple and stupid

11:11.680 --> 11:13.520
 and just counting statistics.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.320
 What was actually more interesting is that you could use that information.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.320
 This comes up again and again in my work.

11:18.320 --> 11:24.080
 If you try to represent people or objects by the things they do, the things you can

11:24.080 --> 11:28.880
 measure about them that have to do with action in the world, so distribution over actions,

11:28.880 --> 11:34.800
 and you try to represent them by the distribution of actions that are done on them, then you

11:34.800 --> 11:40.480
 do a pretty good job of sort of understanding how people are and they cluster remarkably

11:40.480 --> 11:43.040
 well, in fact, irritatingly so.

11:43.040 --> 11:49.440
 And so by clustering people this way, you can, maybe, you know, I got the 93% accuracy

11:49.440 --> 11:53.680
 of what's the next button you're going to press, but I can get 99% accuracy or somewhere

11:53.680 --> 11:56.400
 where there's about on the collections of things you might press.

11:56.400 --> 12:00.160
 And it turns out the things that you might press are all related to number to each other

12:00.160 --> 12:01.280
 in exactly the way that you would expect.

12:01.280 --> 12:07.440
 So, for example, all the numbers on the keypad, it turns out all have the same behavior with

12:07.440 --> 12:09.040
 respect to you as a human being.

12:09.040 --> 12:14.960
 And so you would naturally cluster them together and you discover that numbers are all related

12:14.960 --> 12:16.960
 to one another in some way and all these other things.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.440
 And then, and here's the part that I think is important.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.280
 I mean, you can see this in all kinds of things.

12:21.280 --> 12:27.600
 Every individual is different, but any given individual is remarkably predictable,

12:28.320 --> 12:30.000
 because you keep doing the same things over and over again.

12:30.560 --> 12:34.080
 And the two things that I've learned in the long time that I've been thinking about this

12:34.080 --> 12:38.320
 is people are easily predictable and people hate when you tell them that they're easily

12:38.320 --> 12:40.320
 predictable, but they are.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.280
 And there you go.

12:41.280 --> 12:46.800
 And what about, let me play devil's advocate and philosophically speaking,

12:46.800 --> 12:50.960
 is it possible to say that what defines humans is the outlier?

12:51.520 --> 12:56.880
 So, even though some large percentage of our behaviors, whatever the signal we measure is

12:56.880 --> 13:02.320
 the same and it would cluster nicely, but maybe it's the special moments of when we

13:02.320 --> 13:07.440
 break out of the routine is the definitive things and the way we break out of that routine

13:07.440 --> 13:09.200
 for each one of us might be different.

13:09.200 --> 13:09.680
 It's possible.

13:09.680 --> 13:12.560
 I would say it a little differently, I think.

13:12.560 --> 13:13.600
 I would make two things.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.400
 One is I'm going to disagree with the premise, I think.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.360
 But that's fine.

13:17.360 --> 13:23.600
 I think the way I would put it is there are people who are very different from lots of

13:23.600 --> 13:25.760
 other people, but they're not 0%.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.360
 They're closer to 10%, right?

13:27.360 --> 13:29.680
 So, in fact, even if you do this kind of clustering of people,

13:29.680 --> 13:33.280
 that'll turn out to be the small number of people, they all behave like each other,

13:33.280 --> 13:36.960
 even if they individually behave very differently from everyone else.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.560
 So, I think that's kind of important.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.680
 But what you're really asking, I think, and I think this is really a question is,

13:41.680 --> 13:46.400
 what do you do when you're faced with the situation you've never seen before?

13:46.400 --> 13:49.280
 What do you do when you're faced with an extraordinary situation maybe you've seen

13:49.280 --> 13:52.320
 others do and you're actually forced to do something and you react to that very

13:52.320 --> 13:52.640
 differently?

13:52.640 --> 13:53.920
 And that is the thing that makes you human.

13:53.920 --> 13:58.560
 I would agree with that, at least at a philosophical level, that it's the times

13:58.560 --> 14:03.040
 when you are faced with something difficult, a decision that you have to make,

14:04.080 --> 14:07.040
 where the answer isn't easy, even if you know what the right answer is,

14:07.600 --> 14:09.440
 that's sort of what defines you as the individual.

14:09.440 --> 14:12.480
 And I think what defines people broadly, it's the hard problem.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.280
 It's not the easy problem.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.400
 It's the thing that's going to hurt you.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.040
 It's not the thing.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.360
 It's not even that it's difficult.

14:17.360 --> 14:22.160
 It's just that you know that the outcome is going to be highly suboptimal for you.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.720
 And I do think that that's a reasonable place to start for the question of what makes us human.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.240
 So, before we talk about sort of exploring the different ideas underlying interactive

14:32.240 --> 14:35.920
 artificial intelligence, which we are working on, let me just go along this thread

14:35.920 --> 14:40.480
 to skip to kind of our world of social media, which is something that,

14:41.680 --> 14:46.960
 at least on the artificial intelligence side, you think about there's a popular narrative.

14:46.960 --> 14:54.160
 I don't know if it's true, but that we have these silos in social media and we have these

14:54.160 --> 14:55.840
 clusterings as you're kind of mentioning.

14:56.480 --> 15:04.240
 And the idea is that, you know, along that narrative is that, you know, we want to break

15:04.240 --> 15:10.480
 each other out of those silos so we can be empathetic to other people.

15:10.480 --> 15:14.000
 To if you're a Democrat, you'd be empathetic to the Republican.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.240
 If you're a Republican, you're empathetic Democrat.

15:16.240 --> 15:20.800
 Those are just two silly bins that we seem to be very excited about.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.280
 But there's other binnings that we can think about.

15:24.080 --> 15:27.920
 Is there from an artificial intelligence perspective?

15:27.920 --> 15:32.400
 Because you're just saying we cluster along the data, but then interactive artificial

15:32.400 --> 15:37.840
 intelligence is referring to throwing agents into that mix, AI systems in that mix,

15:38.480 --> 15:43.200
 helping us interacting with us humans and maybe getting us out of those silos.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.640
 Is that something that you think is possible?

15:46.640 --> 15:53.760
 Do you see a hopeful possibility for artificial intelligence systems in these large networks

15:53.760 --> 16:00.000
 of people to get us outside of our habits in at least the idea space?

16:00.000 --> 16:07.760
 To where we can sort of be empathetic to other people's lived experiences,

16:07.760 --> 16:11.360
 other people's points of view, you know, all that kind of stuff?

16:11.360 --> 16:13.200
 Yes, I actually don't think it's that hard.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.200
 Well, it's not hard in this sense.

16:15.200 --> 16:20.480
 So imagine that you can, let's make life simple for a minute.

16:20.480 --> 16:27.040
 Let's assume that you can do a kind of partial ordering over ideas or clusterings of behavior.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.800
 It doesn't even matter what I mean here.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.440
 So long as there's some way that this is a cluster, this is a cluster,

16:31.440 --> 16:32.640
 there's some edge between them, right?

16:32.640 --> 16:35.920
 And this is kind of, they don't quite touch even or maybe they come very close.

16:35.920 --> 16:40.480
 If you can imagine that conceptually, then the way you get from here to here is not by going

16:40.480 --> 16:43.760
 from here to here. The way you get from here to here is you find the edge and you move slowly

16:43.760 --> 16:47.120
 together, right? And I think that machines are actually very good at that sort of thing

16:47.120 --> 16:51.280
 once we kind of define the problem, either in terms of behavior or ideas or words or whatever.

16:51.280 --> 16:55.680
 So it's easy in the sense that if you already have the network and you know the relationships,

16:55.680 --> 16:59.520
 you know, the edges and sort of the strengths on them, and you kind of have some semantic

16:59.520 --> 17:04.000
 meaning for them, the machine doesn't have to, you do as the designer, then yeah,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.800
 I think you can kind of move people along and sort of expand them.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.120
 But it's harder than that. And the reason it's harder than that

17:10.960 --> 17:14.000
 or sort of coming up with the network structure itself is hard is because I'm going to tell

17:14.000 --> 17:18.640
 you a story that I, someone else told me and I don't, I may get some of the details a little

17:18.640 --> 17:23.280
 bit wrong, but it's, it's roughly, it roughly goes like this. You take two sets of people

17:23.280 --> 17:28.880
 from the same backgrounds and you want them to solve a problem. So you separate them up,

17:28.880 --> 17:31.200
 which we do all the time, right? Oh, you know, we're going to break out in the,

17:31.200 --> 17:33.200
 we're going to break out groups. You're going to go over there and you're going to talk about

17:33.200 --> 17:35.760
 this. You're going to go over there and you're going to talk about this. And then you have them

17:36.560 --> 17:39.600
 sort of in this big room, but far apart from one another and you have them sort of interact with

17:39.600 --> 17:44.080
 one another. When they come back to talk about what they learned, you want to merge what they've

17:44.080 --> 17:49.200
 done together, it can be extremely hard because they don't, they basically don't speak the same

17:49.200 --> 17:52.480
 language anymore. Like when you create these problems and you dive into them, you create

17:52.480 --> 17:57.040
 your own language. So the example this one person gave me, which I found kind of interesting because

17:57.040 --> 18:01.440
 we were in the middle of that at the time, was they're sitting over there and they're talking

18:01.440 --> 18:05.280
 about this, these rooms that you can see, but you're seeing them from different vantage points,

18:05.280 --> 18:10.000
 depending upon what side of the room you're on. They can see a clock very easily. And so they

18:10.000 --> 18:14.880
 start referring to the room as the one with the clock. This group over here looking at the same

18:14.880 --> 18:18.640
 room, they can see the clock, but it's, you know, not in their line of sight or whatever. So they

18:18.640 --> 18:24.400
 end up referring to it by some other way. When they get back together and they're talking about

18:24.400 --> 18:28.080
 things, they're referring to the same room and they don't even realize they're referring to the

18:28.080 --> 18:31.440
 same room. In fact, this group doesn't even see that there's a clock there and this group doesn't

18:31.440 --> 18:35.120
 see whatever, the clock on the wall is the thing that stuck with me. So if you create these different

18:35.120 --> 18:40.800
 silos, the problem isn't that the ideologies disagree. It's that you're using the same words

18:40.800 --> 18:45.600
 and they mean radically different things. The hard part is just getting them to agree on the,

18:45.600 --> 18:50.480
 well, maybe we'd say the axioms in our world, right? But, you know, just get them to agree on

18:50.480 --> 18:55.440
 some basic definitions. Because right now, they're talking past each other, just completely

18:55.440 --> 18:59.760
 talking past each other. That's the hard part. Getting them to meet, getting them to interact,

18:59.760 --> 19:04.720
 that may not be that difficult. Getting them to see where their language is leading them to

19:04.720 --> 19:09.360
 be past one another. That's the hard part. It's a really interesting question to me. It could be

19:09.360 --> 19:12.960
 on the layer of language, but it feels like there's multiple layers to this. Like it could be

19:12.960 --> 19:18.160
 worldview. It could be, I mean, all boils down to empathy, being able to put yourself in the shoes

19:18.160 --> 19:24.320
 of the other person, to learn the language, to learn like visually how they see the world,

19:24.320 --> 19:33.280
 to learn like the, I mean, I experienced this now with trolls, the degree of humor in that world.

19:33.280 --> 19:39.600
 For example, I talk about love a lot. I'm very lucky to have this amazing community of loving

19:39.600 --> 19:45.200
 people. But whenever I encounter trolls, they always roll their eyes at the idea of love because

19:45.200 --> 19:56.080
 it's so quote unquote cringe. So they show love by like derision, I would say. And I think about,

19:57.280 --> 20:01.040
 on the human level, that's a whole another discussion, that's psychology, that's sociology,

20:01.040 --> 20:11.520
 so on. But I wonder if AI systems can help somehow and bridge the gap of what is this person's life

20:11.520 --> 20:18.160
 like. Encourage me to just ask that question, to put myself in their shoes, to experience the

20:18.160 --> 20:25.840
 agitations, the fears, the hopes they have, the, to experience, you know, the, even just to think

20:25.840 --> 20:33.440
 about what was there upbringing like, like having a single parent home, or a shitty education, or

20:34.080 --> 20:39.680
 all those kinds of things, just to put myself in that mind space. It feels like that's really

20:39.680 --> 20:46.560
 important for us to bring those clusters together to find that similar language. But it's unclear

20:46.560 --> 20:51.760
 how AI can help that, because it seems like AI systems need to understand both parties first.

20:51.760 --> 20:56.800
 So, you know, the word understand there's doing a lot of work, right? So, do you have to understand

20:56.800 --> 21:03.200
 it, or do you just simply have to note that there is something similar as a point to touch, right?

21:03.200 --> 21:08.800
 So, you know, you use the word empathy, and I like that word for a lot of reasons, I think you're

21:08.800 --> 21:11.760
 right in the way that you're using, in the way that you're describing, but let's separate it from

21:11.760 --> 21:18.320
 sympathy, right? So, you know, sympathy is feeling sort of for someone, empathy is kind of understanding

21:18.320 --> 21:23.600
 where they're coming from and how they feel, right? And for most people, those things go hand in

21:23.600 --> 21:28.720
 hand. For some people, some are very good at empathy and very bad at sympathy. Some people

21:28.720 --> 21:33.200
 cannot experience, well, my observation would be, I'm not a psychologist, my observation would be

21:33.200 --> 21:37.200
 that some people seem incapable of feeling sympathy unless they feel empathy first.

21:37.920 --> 21:42.400
 You can understand someone, understand where they're coming from and still think, no, I can't

21:42.400 --> 21:47.920
 support that, right? It doesn't mean that the only way, because if that isn't the case, then what

21:47.920 --> 21:54.480
 it requires is that you, you must, the only way that you can, to understand someone means you must

21:54.480 --> 22:00.400
 agree with everything that they do, which is it right, right? And if the only way I can feel for

22:00.400 --> 22:07.120
 someone is to completely understand them and make them like me in some way, well, then we're lost,

22:07.120 --> 22:10.720
 right? Because we're not all exactly like each other. I don't have to understand everything

22:10.720 --> 22:14.560
 that you've gone through. It helps clearly, but they're separable ideas, right? Even though they

22:14.560 --> 22:20.080
 get clearly, clearly tangled up in one another. So what I think AI could help you do actually is if,

22:20.080 --> 22:25.920
 and I'm being quite fanciful as it were, but if you think of these as kind of, I understand how

22:25.920 --> 22:29.680
 you interact, the words that you use, the actions you take, I have some way of doing this. Let's

22:29.680 --> 22:36.080
 not worry about what that is, but I can see you as a kind of distribution of experiences and actions

22:36.080 --> 22:40.320
 taken upon you, things you've done and so on. And I can do this with someone else and I can

22:40.320 --> 22:45.120
 find the places where there's some kind of commonality, a mapping as it were, even if it's

22:45.120 --> 22:50.400
 not total. If I think of this as distribution, right, then I can take the cosine of the angle

22:50.400 --> 22:54.960
 between you and if it's zero, you've got nothing in common. If it's one, you're completely the

22:54.960 --> 23:01.280
 same person, well, you're probably not one. You're almost certainly not zero. I can find the place

23:01.280 --> 23:05.200
 where there's the overlap, then I might be able to introduce you on that basis or connect you in

23:05.200 --> 23:13.760
 that way and make it easier for you to take that step of empathy. It's not impossible to do,

23:14.400 --> 23:20.320
 although I wonder if it requires that everyone involved is at least interested in asking the

23:20.320 --> 23:24.000
 question. So maybe the hard part is just getting them interested in asking the question. In fact,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.200
 maybe if you can get them to ask the question, how are we more alike than we are different,

23:27.200 --> 23:30.160
 they'll solve it themselves. Maybe that's the problem that AI should be working on,

23:30.160 --> 23:34.320
 not telling you how you're similar or different, but just getting you to decide that it's

23:34.320 --> 23:38.080
 worth while asking the question. It feels like an economist to answer actually.

23:38.960 --> 23:44.720
 Well, first of all, people would disagree. So let me disagree slightly, which is, I think

23:44.720 --> 23:50.320
 everything you said is brilliant, but I tend to believe philosophically speaking that people

23:50.320 --> 23:58.640
 are interested underneath it all. And I would say that AI, the possibility that an AI system would

23:58.640 --> 24:03.440
 show the commonality is incredible. That's a really good starting point. I would say if you

24:03.440 --> 24:10.720
 should, if on social media, I could discover the common things deep or shallow between me

24:10.720 --> 24:17.920
 and a person who there's tension with, I think that my basic human nature would take over from

24:17.920 --> 24:25.280
 there. And I think enjoy that commonality. And like, there's something sticky about that that

24:25.280 --> 24:30.880
 my mind will linger on. And that person in my mind will become like warmer and warmer. And

24:30.880 --> 24:35.520
 like, I'll start to feel more and more compassionate towards them. I think for majority of the

24:35.520 --> 24:39.440
 population, that's true. But that might be, that's a hypothesis.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.960
 Yeah. I mean, it's an empirical question, right? You'd have to figure it out. I mean,

24:42.960 --> 24:45.680
 I want to believe you're right. And so I'm going to say that I think you're right.

24:46.400 --> 24:52.320
 Of course, some people come to those things for the purpose of trolling, right? And it

24:52.320 --> 24:57.280
 doesn't matter. They're playing a different game. But I don't know. My experience is,

24:57.280 --> 25:02.560
 it requires two things. In fact, maybe this is really at the end what you're saying. And I do

25:02.560 --> 25:12.960
 agree with this for sure. So it's hard to hold on to that kind of anger or to hold on to just a

25:12.960 --> 25:17.600
 desire to humiliate someone for that long. It's just difficult to do. It takes a toll on you.

25:17.600 --> 25:22.320
 But more importantly, we know this, both from people having done studies on it, but also from

25:22.320 --> 25:27.680
 our own experiences, that it is much easier to be dismissive of a person if they're not in front

25:27.680 --> 25:34.080
 of you, if they're not real, right? So much of the history of the world is about making people

25:34.080 --> 25:38.400
 other, right? So if you're in social media, if you're on the web, if you're doing whatever in

25:38.400 --> 25:44.640
 the internet, being forced to deal with someone as a person, some equivalent to being in the same

25:44.640 --> 25:49.120
 room, makes a huge difference. Because then you're one, you're forced to deal with their humanity

25:49.120 --> 25:52.720
 because it's in front of you. The other is, of course, that they might punch you in the face

25:52.720 --> 25:57.200
 if you go too far. So both of those things kind of work together, I think, to the right end.

25:57.200 --> 26:04.400
 So I think bringing people together is really a kind of substitute for forcing them to see the

26:04.400 --> 26:08.880
 humanity in another person and to not be able to treat them as bits. It's hard to troll someone

26:08.880 --> 26:11.440
 when you're looking them in the eye. This is very difficult to do.

26:11.440 --> 26:18.960
 Agreed. Your broad set of research interests fall under interactive AI, as I mentioned,

26:18.960 --> 26:24.400
 which is a fascinating set of ideas. And you have some concrete things that you're particularly

26:24.400 --> 26:30.480
 interested in. But maybe could you talk about how you think about the field of interactive

26:30.480 --> 26:35.440
 artificial intelligence? Sure. So let me say up front that if you look at, certainly my early

26:35.440 --> 26:40.320
 work, but even if you look at most of it, I'm a machine learning guy, right? I do machine

26:40.320 --> 26:44.720
 learning. First paper I ever published was a NIPS. Back then, it was NIPS. Now, it's NURPS.

26:45.440 --> 26:49.600
 It's a long story there. Anyway, that's another thing. So I'm a machine learning guy. I believe

26:49.600 --> 26:53.120
 in data. I believe in statistics and all those kinds of things. And the reason I'm bringing it up

26:53.120 --> 26:57.920
 is even though I'm a newfangled statistical machine learning guy and have been for a very long time,

26:57.920 --> 27:02.880
 the problem I really care about is AI. I care about artificial intelligence. I care about

27:02.880 --> 27:08.480
 building some kind of intelligent artifact. However, that gets expressed, that would be

27:08.480 --> 27:14.240
 the, at least as intelligent as humans and as interesting as humans, perhaps on their,

27:14.240 --> 27:19.200
 on their, they're sort of in their own way. So that's the deep underlying love and dream is the

27:19.200 --> 27:25.280
 bigger AI. Yes. Whatever the heck that is. Yeah. The machine learning in some ways is a means to

27:25.280 --> 27:30.000
 the end. It is not the end. And I don't understand how one could be intelligent without learning.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.360
 So therefore, I got to figure out how to do that, right? So that's important. But machine learning,

27:33.360 --> 27:38.320
 by the way, is also a tool. I said statistical because that's what most people think of themselves.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.440
 Machine learning people, that's how they think. Thinking that Pat Langley might disagree or at

27:41.440 --> 27:47.440
 least 1980s, Pat Langley might disagree with what it takes to do machine learning. But I care about

27:47.440 --> 27:51.520
 the AI problem, which is why it's interactive AI, not just interactive ML. I think it's important

27:51.520 --> 27:56.400
 to understand that there's a longterm goal here, which I will probably never live to see. But I

27:56.400 --> 28:01.200
 would love to have been a part of, which is building something truly intelligent outside of,

28:01.200 --> 28:05.680
 outside of ourselves. Can we take a tiny tangent or am I interrupting? Which is,

28:05.680 --> 28:14.400
 is there something you can say concrete about the mysterious gap between the subset ML and the

28:14.400 --> 28:20.960
 bigger AI? What's missing? What's what do you think? I mean, obviously, it's totally unknown,

28:20.960 --> 28:25.520
 not totally, but in part unknown at this time. But is it something like with Pat Langley's,

28:25.520 --> 28:31.520
 is it knowledge, like expert system reasoning type of kind of thing? So AI is bigger than ML,

28:31.520 --> 28:36.560
 but ML is bigger than AI. This is kind of the real problem here is that they're really overlapping

28:36.560 --> 28:40.400
 things that are really interested in slightly different problems. I tend to think of ML, and

28:40.400 --> 28:43.360
 there are many people out there are going to be very upset at me about this, but I tend to think

28:43.360 --> 28:47.120
 of ML being much more concerned with the engineering of solving a problem and AI about

28:47.120 --> 28:51.360
 the sort of more philosophical goal of true intelligence. And that's the thing that motivates

28:51.360 --> 28:56.880
 me, even if I end up finding myself living in this kind of engineeringish space. I've now made

28:56.880 --> 29:02.720
 Michael Jordan upset. But to me, they just feel very different. You're just measuring them

29:02.720 --> 29:07.200
 differently. You're sort of goals of where you're trying to be are somewhat different.

29:07.200 --> 29:13.680
 But to me, AI is about trying to build that intelligent thing. And typically, but not always,

29:13.680 --> 29:17.520
 for the purpose of understanding ourselves a little bit better. Machine learning is,

29:17.520 --> 29:22.240
 I think, trying to solve the problem, whatever that problem is. Now, that's my take. Others,

29:22.240 --> 29:28.000
 of course, would disagree. So on that note, with the interactive AI, do you tend to in your mind

29:28.000 --> 29:33.760
 visualize AI as a singular system, or is it as a collective huge amount of systems interacting

29:33.760 --> 29:40.640
 with each other? Is the social interaction of us humans and of AI systems the fundamental

29:40.640 --> 29:44.560
 to intelligence? Well, it's certainly fundamental to our kind of intelligence,

29:44.560 --> 29:49.840
 right? And I actually think it matters quite a bit. So the reason the interactive AI part matters

29:49.840 --> 29:58.960
 to me is because I don't, this is going to sound simple, but I don't care whether a tree makes a

29:58.960 --> 30:03.920
 sound when it falls and there's no one around because I don't think it matters, right? If there's

30:03.920 --> 30:08.480
 no observer in some sense. And I think what's interesting about the way that we're intelligent

30:08.480 --> 30:13.760
 is we're intelligent with other people, right, or other things anyway. And we go out of our way to

30:13.760 --> 30:18.640
 make other things intelligent. We're hardwired to like find intention, even whether there is no

30:18.640 --> 30:23.360
 intention to why we anthropomorphize everything. We, I think anyway, we, we, I think the interactive

30:23.360 --> 30:29.280
 AI part is being intelligent in and of myself in an isolation is a meaningless act in some sense.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.760
 The correct answer is you have to be intelligent in the way that you interact others. It's also

30:33.760 --> 30:39.040
 efficient because it allows you to learn faster because you can import from, you know, past history.

30:39.600 --> 30:43.680
 It also allows you to be efficient in the transmission of that. So we ask ourselves about

30:43.680 --> 30:49.760
 me. Am I intelligent? Clearly, I think so. But I'm also intelligent as a part of a larger

30:49.760 --> 30:54.160
 species and group of people and we're trying to move the species forward as well. And so I think

30:54.160 --> 30:58.880
 that notion of being intelligent with others is kind of the key thing because otherwise you,

30:58.880 --> 31:04.400
 you come and you go and then it doesn't matter. And so that's why I care about that aspect of it.

31:04.400 --> 31:09.280
 And it has lots of other implications. One is not just, you know, building something

31:09.280 --> 31:13.040
 intelligent with others, but understanding that you can't always communicate with those others.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.720
 They have been in a room where there's a clock on the wall that you haven't seen, which means you

31:16.720 --> 31:20.160
 have to spend an enormous amount of time communicating with one another constantly

31:20.720 --> 31:24.960
 in order to figure out what the other, what each other wants, right? So, I mean, this is why people

31:24.960 --> 31:29.760
 project, right? You project your own intentions and your own reasons for doing things on the others

31:29.760 --> 31:33.760
 as a way of understanding them so that you know, you know how to behave. But by the way, you,

31:34.560 --> 31:37.840
 completely predictable person, I don't know how you're predictable. I don't know you well enough,

31:37.840 --> 31:42.000
 but you probably eat the same five things over and over again or whatever it is that you do, right?

31:42.000 --> 31:45.760
 I know I do. If I'm going to a new Chinese restaurant, I will get General Gal's chicken

31:45.760 --> 31:50.240
 because that's the thing that's easy. I will get hot and sour soup. You know, the people do the

31:50.240 --> 31:54.720
 things that they do, but other people get the chicken and broccoli. I can push this analogy way

31:54.720 --> 31:58.160
 too far. The chicken and broccoli. I don't know what's wrong with those people. I don't know what's

31:58.160 --> 32:03.600
 wrong with them either. They, we have all had our trauma. So they get their chicken and broccoli

32:03.600 --> 32:08.400
 and their egg drop soup or whatever. We got to communicate and it's going to change, right?

32:08.400 --> 32:14.720
 So it's not, interactive AI is not just about learning to solve a problem or a task. It's about

32:14.720 --> 32:18.800
 having to adapt that over time, over a very long period of time and interacting with other people

32:19.520 --> 32:22.880
 who will themselves change. This is what we mean about things like adaptable models, right?

32:22.880 --> 32:26.400
 That you have to have a model that model's going to change. And by the way, it's not just the case

32:26.400 --> 32:30.240
 that you're different from that person, but you're different from the person you were 15 minutes ago

32:30.240 --> 32:35.120
 or certainly 15 years ago. And I have to assume that you're at least going to drift, hopefully not

32:35.120 --> 32:38.640
 too many discontinuities, but you're going to, you're going to drift over time. And I have to

32:38.640 --> 32:45.120
 have some mechanism for adapting to that as you an individual over time and across individuals

32:45.120 --> 32:51.440
 over time. On the topic of adaptive modeling and you talk about lifelong learning, which is a,

32:52.400 --> 32:58.640
 I think a topic that's understudied or maybe because nobody knows what to do with it.

32:59.360 --> 33:04.480
 But like, you know, if you look at Alexa or most of our artificial intelligence systems that are

33:04.480 --> 33:08.800
 primarily machine learning based systems or dialogue systems, all those kinds of things,

33:08.800 --> 33:18.320
 they know very little about you in the sense of the lifelong learning sense that we learn,

33:18.320 --> 33:25.920
 as humans, we learn a lot about each other, not in the quantity effects, but like the

33:25.920 --> 33:34.400
 temporally rich side of information that seems to like pick up the crumbs along the way that

33:34.400 --> 33:40.960
 somehow seems to capture a person pretty well. Do you have any ideas how to do lifelong learning?

33:42.000 --> 33:45.360
 Because it seems like most of the machine learning community does not.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.840
 No. Well, by the way, not only does the machine learning community not,

33:47.840 --> 33:51.040
 not spend a lot of time on lifelong learning. I don't think they spend a lot of time on

33:51.040 --> 33:56.640
 learning period in the sense that they tend to be very task focused. Everybody is overfitting to

33:56.640 --> 34:00.800
 whatever problem is they happen to have. They're overengineering their solutions to the task.

34:01.360 --> 34:05.040
 Even the people, and I think these people do, are trying to solve a hard problem of

34:05.040 --> 34:07.920
 transfer learning, right? I'm going to learn on one task and learn the other task.

34:07.920 --> 34:11.200
 It's, you still end up creating the task. You know, it's like looking for your keys where the

34:11.200 --> 34:14.720
 light is because that's where the light is, right? It's not because the keys have to be there.

34:14.720 --> 34:20.400
 I mean, one could argue that we tend to do this in general. We tend to kind of do it as a group.

34:20.400 --> 34:25.200
 We tend to hill climb and get stuck in local optima. And I think we do this in the small,

34:25.200 --> 34:31.600
 the small as well. I think it's very hard to do because, so, look, here's the hard thing about

34:31.600 --> 34:35.280
 AI, right? The hard thing about AI is it keeps changing on us, right? You know, what is AI?

34:35.280 --> 34:39.280
 AI is the, you know, the art and science of making computers act the way they do in the movies,

34:39.280 --> 34:42.400
 right? That's what it is, right? That's a good definition.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.120
 But beyond that, it's... And they keep coming up with new movies.

34:45.120 --> 34:52.240
 Yes. Right, exactly. We are driven by this kind of need to sort of ineffable quality of who we

34:52.240 --> 34:57.360
 are, which means that the moment you understand something is no longer AI, right? Well, we

34:57.360 --> 35:00.800
 understand this. That's just, you take the derivatives and you divide by two and then you

35:00.800 --> 35:03.760
 average it out over time in the window. So, therefore, that's no longer AI.

35:03.760 --> 35:07.520
 So, the problem is unsolvable because it keeps kind of going away. This creates a kind of

35:07.520 --> 35:10.800
 illusion, which I don't think is an entire illusion, of either there's very simple task

35:10.800 --> 35:15.440
 based things you can do very well than over engineer. There's all of AI and there's like

35:15.440 --> 35:19.600
 nothing in the middle. Like, it's very hard to get from here to here and it's very hard to see

35:19.600 --> 35:24.400
 how to get from here to here. And I don't think that we've done a very good job of it because

35:24.400 --> 35:28.400
 we get stuck trying to solve the small problems in front of it, myself included. I'm not going to

35:28.400 --> 35:34.240
 pretend that I'm better at this than anyone else. And of course, all the incentives in academia

35:34.240 --> 35:38.800
 and in industry are set to make that very hard because you have to get the next paper out.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.400
 You have to get the next product out. You have to solve this problem and it's very sort of

35:42.400 --> 35:48.720
 naturally incremental. And none of the incentives are set up to allow you to take a huge risk

35:48.720 --> 35:54.320
 unless you're already so well established you can take that big risk. And if you're that well

35:54.320 --> 35:57.760
 established that you can take that big risk, then you've probably spent much of your career

35:57.760 --> 36:02.640
 taking these little risks, relatively speaking. And so, you have got a lifetime of experience

36:02.640 --> 36:06.160
 telling you not to take that particular big risk, right? So, the whole system's set up to make

36:06.160 --> 36:11.040
 progress very slow. That's fine. It's just the way it is. But it does make this gap seem really big,

36:11.040 --> 36:16.240
 which is my long way of saying, I don't have a great answer to it, except that stop doing

36:16.240 --> 36:21.600
 n equals one. At least try to get n equal two and maybe n equals seven so that you can say,

36:21.600 --> 36:25.360
 I'm going to, or maybe t is a better variable here. I'm going to not just solve this problem,

36:25.360 --> 36:28.160
 I'm going to solve this problem and another problem. I'm not going to learn just on you.

36:28.160 --> 36:32.080
 I'm going to keep living out there in the world and just seeing what happens and that we'll learn

36:32.080 --> 36:36.800
 something as designers and our machine learning algorithms and our AI algorithms can learn as

36:36.800 --> 36:41.360
 well. But unless you're willing to build a system, which you're going to have live for months at a

36:41.360 --> 36:47.040
 time in an environment that is messy and chaotic, you cannot control, then you're never going to

36:47.040 --> 36:51.440
 make progress in that direction. So, I guess my answer to you is yes. My idea is that you should,

36:51.440 --> 36:57.920
 it's not no, it's yes. You should be deploying these things and making them live for months at

36:57.920 --> 37:02.480
 a time and be okay with the fact that it's going to take you five years to do this. Not rerunning

37:02.480 --> 37:06.400
 the same experiment over and over again and refining the machine so it's slightly better

37:06.400 --> 37:12.320
 at whatever, but actually having it out there and living in the chaos of the world and seeing what

37:12.320 --> 37:16.800
 its learning algorithm say can learn, what data structure it can build and how it can go from

37:16.800 --> 37:21.360
 there. Without that, you're going to be stuck all the moment. What do you think about the

37:21.360 --> 37:28.240
 possibility of n equals one growing is probably a crude approximation, but growing like if you

37:28.240 --> 37:34.240
 look at language models like GPT3, if you just make it big enough, it'll swallow the world,

37:34.240 --> 37:42.320
 meaning like it'll solve all your t to infinity by just growing in size of this, taking the small

37:42.320 --> 37:48.240
 overengineered solution and just pumping it full of steroids in terms of compute, in terms of

37:48.240 --> 37:54.160
 size of training data and the Yanlacoon style self supervised or open AI self supervised,

37:54.160 --> 38:02.720
 just throw all of YouTube at it and it will learn how to reason, how to paint, how to create music,

38:03.280 --> 38:08.000
 how to love all of that by watching YouTube videos. I mean, I can't think of a more terrifying

38:08.000 --> 38:12.640
 world to live in than a world that is based on YouTube videos, but yeah, I think the answer

38:12.640 --> 38:18.400
 that I just kind of don't think that'll quite well, it won't work that easily. You will get

38:18.400 --> 38:22.800
 somewhere and you will learn something, which means it's probably worth it, but you won't get

38:22.800 --> 38:29.440
 there. You won't solve the problem. Here's the thing. We build these things and we say we want

38:29.440 --> 38:34.160
 them to learn, but what actually happens, and let's say they do learn, I mean, certainly every

38:34.160 --> 38:38.320
 paper I've gotten published, the things learn, I don't know about anyone else, but they actually

38:38.320 --> 38:44.160
 change us. We react to it differently, so we keep redefining what it means to be successful,

38:44.160 --> 38:49.840
 both in the negative in the case, but also in the positive in that, oh, well, this is an accomplishment.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.000
 I'll give you an example, which is like the one you just described with YouTube. Let's

38:54.000 --> 38:57.280
 get completely out of machine learning. Well, not completely, but mostly out of machine learning.

38:57.280 --> 39:02.880
 Think about Google. People were trying to solve information retrieval, the ad hoc information

39:02.880 --> 39:08.880
 retrieval problem forever. I mean, first major book I ever read about it was, what, 71? I think

39:08.880 --> 39:14.080
 it was when it came out. Anyway, we'll treat everything as a vector and we'll do these vector

39:14.080 --> 39:18.960
 space models and whatever, and that was all great. We made very little progress. I mean,

39:18.960 --> 39:24.640
 we made some progress. Then Google comes and makes the ad hoc problem seem pretty easy. I mean,

39:24.640 --> 39:29.120
 it's not. There's lots of computers and databases involved, and there's some brilliant

39:29.120 --> 39:35.520
 algorithmic stuff behind it, too, and some systems building. But the problem changed, right?

39:37.520 --> 39:41.680
 If you've got a world that's that connected so that you have, you know,

39:41.680 --> 39:45.200
 there are 10 million answers quite literally to the question that you're asking,

39:46.560 --> 39:51.440
 then the problem wasn't, give me the things that are relevant. The problem is, don't give me anything

39:51.440 --> 39:57.760
 that's irrelevant, at least in the first page, because nothing else matters. So Google is not

39:57.760 --> 40:04.000
 solving the information retrieval problem, at least not on this web page. Google is minimizing

40:04.000 --> 40:09.280
 false positives, which is not the same thing as getting an answer. It turns out it's good enough

40:09.280 --> 40:13.760
 for what it is we want to use Google for, but it also changes what the problem was we thought we

40:13.760 --> 40:17.200
 were trying to solve in the first place. You thought you were trying to find an answer,

40:17.200 --> 40:20.400
 but you're not. We're trying to find the answer, but it turns out you're just trying to find an

40:20.400 --> 40:24.400
 answer. Now, yes, it is true. It's also very good at finding you exactly that web page. Of course,

40:24.400 --> 40:27.840
 you trained yourself to figure out what the keywords were to get you that web page,

40:28.960 --> 40:33.680
 but in the end, by having that much data, you've just changed the problem into something else.

40:33.680 --> 40:37.040
 You haven't actually learned what you set out to learn. Now, the counter to that would be,

40:37.040 --> 40:41.360
 maybe we're not doing that either. We just think we are because, you know, we're in our own heads.

40:41.360 --> 40:45.520
 Maybe we're learning the wrong problem in the first place, but I don't think that matters. I

40:45.520 --> 40:50.720
 think the point is, is that Google has not solved information retrieval. Google has done amazing

40:50.720 --> 40:54.000
 service. I have nothing bad to say about what they've done. Lord knows my entire life is better,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.840
 because Google exists in form for Google Maps. I don't think I've ever found this place.

40:59.120 --> 41:06.720
 Where is this? Like in 95, I see 110 and I see, but where did 95 go? You know, so I'm very grateful

41:06.720 --> 41:10.000
 for Google, but you know, they just have to make certain the first five things are right.

41:11.040 --> 41:14.560
 And everything after that is wrong. Look, we're going off in a totally different

41:14.560 --> 41:20.880
 topic here, but think about the way we hire faculty. Exactly the same thing.

41:20.880 --> 41:24.640
 How are you getting controversial? How are you getting controversial? It's

41:24.640 --> 41:31.600
 exactly the same problem, right? It's minimizing false positives. We say things like we want to

41:31.600 --> 41:39.440
 find the best person to be an assistant professor at MIT in the new College of Computing, which I

41:39.440 --> 41:45.200
 will point out was founded 30 years after the College of Computing I'm a part of. Both are my

41:45.200 --> 41:50.480
 alma mater. Both are fighting words. I'm just saying I appreciate all that they did and all that

41:50.480 --> 41:58.320
 they're doing. Anyway, so we're going to try to hire the best professor. That's what we say,

41:58.320 --> 42:02.880
 the best person for this job. But that's not what we do at all, right? Do you know which

42:02.880 --> 42:10.240
 percentage of faculty in the top four earn their PhDs from the top four? Say in 2017,

42:10.240 --> 42:12.720
 for which we have, which is the most recent year for which I have data.

42:12.720 --> 42:17.600
 Maybe a large percentage. It's about 60%. 60%. 60% of the faculty in the top four earn their

42:17.600 --> 42:21.760
 PhDs in top four. This is computer science for which there is no top five. There's only a top

42:21.760 --> 42:25.280
 four, right? Because they're all tied for one. For people who don't know, by the way, that would be

42:25.280 --> 42:33.280
 MIT stand for Berkeley CMU. Yep. Georgia Tech. Number eight. Number eight. You're keeping track.

42:34.080 --> 42:38.240
 Oh, yes. It's a large part of my job. Number five is Illinois. Number six is a tie with

42:39.280 --> 42:43.680
 UW and Cornell and Princeton and Georgia Tech are tied for eight and UT Austin is number 10.

42:43.680 --> 42:48.320
 Michigan's number 11, by the way. So if you look at the top 10,

42:48.880 --> 42:52.720
 you know what percentage of faculty in the top 10 earn their PhDs from the top 10?

42:54.000 --> 43:02.240
 65, roughly. 65%. If you look at the top 55 ranked departments, 50% of the faculty earn

43:02.240 --> 43:10.720
 their PhDs from the top 10. There is no universe in which all the best faculty, even just for R1

43:10.720 --> 43:15.360
 universities, the majority of them come from 10 places. There's just no way that's true,

43:15.360 --> 43:18.880
 especially when you consider how small some of those universities are in terms of the number

43:18.880 --> 43:23.600
 of PhDs they produce. Yeah. Now, that's not a negative. I mean, it is a negative. It also has

43:23.600 --> 43:31.760
 a habit of entrenching certain historical inequities and accidents. But what it tells you is, well,

43:31.760 --> 43:36.960
 ask yourself the question. Why is it like that? Well, because it's easier.

43:36.960 --> 43:43.840
 If we go all the way back to the 1980s, there was a saying that nobody ever lost his job

43:43.840 --> 43:49.920
 buying a computer from IBM. It was true. Nobody ever lost their job hiring a PhD from MIT.

43:51.680 --> 43:55.520
 If the person turned out to be terrible, well, they came from MIT. What did you expect me to

43:55.520 --> 44:02.240
 know? However, that same person coming from pick whichever is your least favorite place that produces

44:02.240 --> 44:08.000
 PhDs and say computer science, well, you took a risk. So all the incentives, particularly because

44:08.000 --> 44:11.760
 you're only going to hire one this year, well, now we're hiring 10, but you're only going to hire one

44:11.760 --> 44:15.200
 or two or three this year. And by the way, when they come in, you're stuck with them for at least

44:15.200 --> 44:18.480
 seven years in most places because that's before you know whether you're getting tenure or not.

44:18.480 --> 44:22.320
 And if they get tenure, stuck with them for 30 years unless they decide to leave. That means

44:22.320 --> 44:25.440
 the pressure to get this right is very high. So what are you going to do? You're going to minimize

44:26.160 --> 44:32.080
 false positives. You don't care about saying no inappropriately. You only care about saying yes

44:32.080 --> 44:36.720
 inappropriately. So all the pressure drives you into that particular direction. Google,

44:37.840 --> 44:41.840
 not to put too fine a point on it, wasn't exactly the same situation with their search.

44:41.840 --> 44:46.320
 It turns out you just don't want to give people the wrong page in the first three or four pages.

44:46.880 --> 44:50.480
 And if there's 10 million right answers and a hundred bazillion wrong answers,

44:50.480 --> 44:53.120
 just make certain the wrong answers don't get up there. And who cares if you,

44:53.120 --> 44:58.320
 the right answer was actually the 13th page. A right answer, a satisfying answer,

44:58.320 --> 45:02.560
 is number one, two, three or four. So who cares? Or an answer that will make you discover something

45:02.560 --> 45:06.800
 beautiful, profound to your question. Well, that's a different problem, right?

45:06.800 --> 45:13.920
 But isn't that the problem? Can we link on this topic without sort of walking with Grace?

45:15.040 --> 45:24.960
 How do we get for hiring faculty? How do we get that 13th page with the truly special person?

45:24.960 --> 45:29.200
 Like there's, I mean, it depends on the department of computer science probably has those department,

45:29.920 --> 45:34.720
 those kinds of people, like you have the Russian guy, Grigory Perlman,

45:36.480 --> 45:44.320
 like just these awkward, strange minds that don't know how to play the little game of etiquette that

45:45.840 --> 45:50.480
 faculty have all agreed somehow, like converged over the decades, how to play with each other.

45:50.480 --> 45:56.800
 And also is not, you know, on top of that is not from the top four, top whatever numbers,

45:56.800 --> 46:01.360
 the schools. And maybe actually just says a few every once in a while to the

46:03.200 --> 46:08.480
 traditions of old within the computer science community, maybe talks trash about machine

46:08.480 --> 46:16.080
 learning is a total waste of time. And that's there on the resume. So like, how do you allow

46:16.080 --> 46:20.880
 the system to give those folks a chance? Well, you have to be willing to take a certain kind of,

46:20.880 --> 46:24.000
 without taking a particular position on any particular person, you'd have to take,

46:24.000 --> 46:28.560
 you have to be willing to take risk, right? A small amount of, I mean, if we were treating this as a,

46:29.440 --> 46:32.640
 well, as a machine learning problem, right, as a search problem, which is what it is,

46:32.640 --> 46:36.080
 it's a search problem. If we were treating it that way, you would say, oh, well, the main thing is,

46:36.080 --> 46:40.560
 you know, you've got a prior, you want some data because I'm Bayesian, if you don't want to do it

46:40.560 --> 46:45.840
 that way, we'll just inject some randomness in and it'll be okay. The problem is that feels

46:45.840 --> 46:53.040
 very, very hard to do with people. All the incentives are wrong there. But it turns out,

46:53.040 --> 46:56.720
 and let's say, let's say that's the right answer, let's just give for the sake of argument that,

46:56.720 --> 47:00.480
 you know, injecting randomness in the system at that level for who you hire is just not,

47:00.480 --> 47:05.040
 not worth doing because the price is too high or the cost is too high. We had infinite resources,

47:05.040 --> 47:08.080
 sure, but we don't. And also, you've got to teach people. So, you know, you're ruining other

47:08.080 --> 47:14.240
 people's lives if you get it too wrong. But we've taken that principle, even if I grant it,

47:14.240 --> 47:22.720
 and pushed it all the way back, right? So, we could have a better pool than we have of people

47:22.720 --> 47:28.160
 we look at and give an opportunity to. If we do that, then we have a better chance of finding that.

47:28.160 --> 47:31.920
 Of course, that just pushes the problem back, back another level. But let me tell you something

47:31.920 --> 47:36.160
 else, you know, I did a sort of study, I call it a study, I call the pay to my friends and ask

47:36.160 --> 47:39.520
 them for all of their data for graduate admissions. But then someone else followed up and did an

47:39.520 --> 47:45.200
 actual study. And it turns out that I can tell you how everybody gets into grad school, more or

47:45.200 --> 47:50.960
 less, more or less. You basically admit everyone from places higher ranked than you. You admit

47:50.960 --> 47:54.160
 most people from places ranked around you, and you admit almost no one from places ranked below

47:54.160 --> 47:57.840
 you, with the exception of the small liberal arts colleges that aren't ranked at all, like Harvey

47:57.840 --> 48:03.280
 Mudd, because they don't, they're a PhD, so they aren't ranked. This is all CS. Which means the

48:03.280 --> 48:10.080
 decision of whether, you know, you become a professor at Cornell was determined when you

48:10.080 --> 48:16.800
 were 17, right? By where, what you knew to go to undergrad to do whatever, right? So if we can push

48:16.800 --> 48:20.000
 these things back a little bit and just make the pool a little bit bigger, at least you raise the

48:20.000 --> 48:26.000
 probability that you will be able to see someone interesting and take the risk. The other answer

48:26.000 --> 48:31.360
 to that question, by the way, which you could argue is the same as you either adjust the pool

48:31.360 --> 48:36.800
 so the probabilities go up. That's a way of injecting a little bit of uniform noise in the

48:36.800 --> 48:41.920
 system as it were. As you change your loss function, you just let yourself be measured by

48:41.920 --> 48:47.840
 something other than whatever it is that we're measuring ourselves by now. I mean, US News and

48:47.840 --> 48:53.120
 World Report, every time they change their formula for determining rankings, move entire universities

48:53.120 --> 48:59.040
 to behave differently, because rankings matter. Can you talk trash about those rankings for a

48:59.040 --> 49:05.280
 second? No, I'm joking about talking trash. I actually, it's so funny how from my perspective,

49:05.280 --> 49:11.600
 from a very shallow perspective, how dogmatic, like how much I trust those rankings, they're

49:11.600 --> 49:19.280
 almost ingrained in my head. I mean, at MIT, everybody kind of, it's a propagated,

49:20.080 --> 49:26.160
 mutually agreed upon, like idea that those rankings matter. And I don't think anyone knows what

49:26.160 --> 49:32.880
 they're like. Most people don't know what they're based on. And what are they exactly based on?

49:32.880 --> 49:38.000
 And what are the flaws in that? Well, so it depends on which rankings you're talking about.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.160
 Do you want to talk about computer science or are we going to talk about university?

49:40.160 --> 49:45.280
 Computer science, US News is not the main one. The only one that matters is US News,

49:45.280 --> 49:50.320
 nothing that matters. Sorry, CSRankings.org, but nothing else matters, but US News. So,

49:50.320 --> 49:55.680
 US News has formula that it uses for many things, but not for computer science because computer

49:55.680 --> 50:02.960
 science is considered a science, which is absurd. So, the rankings for computer science is 100%

50:02.960 --> 50:10.560
 reputation. So, two people at each department, it's not really department, whatever, at each

50:10.560 --> 50:15.920
 department basically rank everybody, slightly more complicated than that, but whatever, they

50:15.920 --> 50:20.720
 rank everyone. And then those things are put together and then somehow rankings come up.

50:20.720 --> 50:25.600
 How do you improve reputation? How do you move up and down the space of reputation?

50:25.600 --> 50:31.760
 Yes, that's exactly the question. Twitter? It can help. I can tell you how Georgia Tech did it,

50:31.760 --> 50:35.680
 or at least how I think Georgia Tech did it, because Georgia Tech is actually the case to look

50:35.680 --> 50:40.240
 at, not just because I'm at Georgia Tech, but because Georgia Tech is the only computing unit

50:40.240 --> 50:44.560
 that was not in the top 20 that has made it into the top 10. It's also the only one in the last

50:44.560 --> 50:53.040
 two decades, I think, that moved up in the top 10 as opposed to having someone else move down.

50:53.040 --> 50:58.320
 So, we used to be number 10, and then we became number nine because UT Austin went down slightly

50:58.320 --> 51:02.880
 and now we retired for ninth because that's how rankings work. And we moved from nine to eight

51:02.880 --> 51:09.760
 because our raw score moved up a point. So, Georgia, something about Georgia Tech, computer science,

51:09.760 --> 51:16.880
 or computing, anyway. I think it's because we have shown leadership at every crisis level.

51:16.880 --> 51:20.880
 So, we created a college, first public university to do it, second college, second university to

51:20.880 --> 51:26.400
 do it after CMU is number one. I also think it's no accident that CMU is the largest and we're

51:26.400 --> 51:30.080
 depending upon how you count and depending on exactly where MIT ends up with its final

51:30.080 --> 51:33.120
 college of computing, second or third largest. I don't think that's an accident. We've been

51:33.120 --> 51:37.840
 doing this for a long time. But in the 2000s, when there was a crisis about undergraduate

51:37.840 --> 51:43.600
 education, Georgia Tech took a big risk and succeeded at rethinking undergrad education

51:43.600 --> 51:49.120
 and computing. I think we created these schools at a time when most public universities,

51:49.120 --> 51:54.880
 in a way, were afraid to do it. We did the online masters and that mattered because

51:54.880 --> 51:58.240
 people were trying to figure out what to do with MOOCs and so on. I think it's about

51:58.240 --> 52:04.080
 being observed by your peers and having an impact. So, I mean, that is what reputation is, right?

52:04.080 --> 52:08.800
 So, the way you move up in the reputation rankings is by doing something that makes people turn

52:08.800 --> 52:14.880
 and look at you and say, that's good, they're better than I thought. Beyond that, it's just inertia

52:14.880 --> 52:18.880
 and there's huge hysteresis in the system, right? I mean, there was these, I can't remember this,

52:18.880 --> 52:25.440
 this is maybe apocryphal, but there's a major or department that like MIT was ranked number one in

52:25.440 --> 52:29.520
 and they didn't have it, right? It's just about what you, I don't know if that's true, but someone

52:29.520 --> 52:35.360
 said that to me anyway. But it's a thing, right? It's all about reputation. Of course, MIT is great

52:35.360 --> 52:39.760
 because MIT is great. It's always been great. By the way, because MIT is great, the best students

52:39.760 --> 52:45.520
 come, which keeps it being great. I mean, it's just a positive feedback loop. It's not surprising.

52:45.520 --> 52:50.560
 I don't think it's wrong. Yeah, but it's almost like a narrative. It doesn't actually have to be

52:50.560 --> 52:59.120
 backed by reality and it's not to say anything about MIT, but it does feel like we're playing

52:59.120 --> 53:04.640
 in the space of narratives, not the space of something grounded. And one of the surprising

53:04.640 --> 53:09.520
 things when I showed up at MIT and just all the students I've worked with and all the research

53:10.720 --> 53:16.240
 I've done is they're the same people as I've met other places.

53:18.400 --> 53:22.080
 I mean, what MIT has going for it? Well, MIT has many things going for it. One of the things MIT

53:22.080 --> 53:29.040
 has going for it is a nice logo. It's a lot better than it was when I was here. Nice colors too.

53:29.040 --> 53:35.120
 Terrible, terrible name for a mascot. But the thing that MIT has going for it is it really

53:35.120 --> 53:39.520
 does get the best students. It just doesn't get all of the best students. There are many more

53:39.520 --> 53:43.520
 best students out there, right? And the best students want to be here because it's the best place

53:44.240 --> 53:47.680
 to be or one of the best places to be. And it just kind of, it's a sort of positive feedback.

53:47.680 --> 53:53.040
 But you said something earlier, which I think is worth examining for a moment, right? And you said

53:53.040 --> 53:58.720
 it's, I forget the word G as you said, we're living in the space of narrative as opposed to

53:58.720 --> 54:03.360
 something objective. Narrative is objective. I mean, one could argue that the only thing that

54:03.360 --> 54:08.160
 we do as humans is narrative. We just build stories to explain why we do this. Someone

54:08.160 --> 54:12.960
 once asked me, but wait, there's nothing objective. No, it's completely an objective measure. It's

54:12.960 --> 54:20.800
 an objective measure of the opinions of everybody else. Now, is that physics? I don't know. But,

54:20.800 --> 54:24.800
 you know, what, I mean, tell me something you think is actually objective and measurable in a

54:24.800 --> 54:30.720
 way that makes sense. Like cameras, they don't, do you know that, I mean, you're getting me off

54:30.720 --> 54:37.040
 on something, but do you know that cameras, which are just reflecting light and putting them on film,

54:37.040 --> 54:44.480
 like did not work for dark skinned people until like the 1970s? You know why? Because you were

54:44.480 --> 54:48.560
 building cameras for the people who were going to buy cameras, who all, at least in the United

54:48.560 --> 54:53.600
 States and Western Europe, were relatively light skinned. Turns out, took terrible pictures of

54:53.600 --> 54:59.360
 people who look like me that got fixed with better film and whole processes. Do you know why?

55:00.160 --> 55:05.360
 Because furniture manufacturers wanted to be able to take pictures of mahogany furniture,

55:05.360 --> 55:12.400
 right? Because candy manufacturers wanted to be able to take pictures of chocolate. Now,

55:12.400 --> 55:18.560
 the reason I bring that up is because you might think that cameras are objective. They're

55:18.560 --> 55:22.880
 objective. They're just capturing light. No, they're made, they are doing the things that

55:22.880 --> 55:28.480
 they are doing based upon decisions by real human beings to privilege, if I may use that word,

55:28.480 --> 55:32.160
 some physics over others because it's an engineering problem. They're tradeoffs, right?

55:32.160 --> 55:36.000
 So I can either worry about this part of the spectrum or this part of the spectrum. This

55:36.000 --> 55:39.760
 costs more, that costs less, this costs the same, but I have more people paying money over here,

55:39.760 --> 55:44.400
 right? And it turns out that, you know, if a jack, you know, if an agglomerate wants you,

55:44.400 --> 55:47.600
 demands that you do something different and it's going to involve all kinds of money for you,

55:47.600 --> 55:51.840
 suddenly the tradeoffs change, right? And so there you go. I actually don't know how I ended

55:51.840 --> 55:56.320
 up there. Oh, it's because of this notion of objectiveness, right? So even the objective

55:56.320 --> 55:59.200
 isn't objective because at the end you've got to tell a story, you've got to make decisions,

55:59.200 --> 56:03.120
 you've got to make tradeoff or what else is engineering other than that. So I think that

56:03.120 --> 56:09.520
 the rankings capture something. They just don't necessarily capture what people assume they capture.

56:10.480 --> 56:19.920
 You know, just to linger on this, this idea, why is there not more people who just like play

56:19.920 --> 56:23.760
 with whatever that narrative is, have fun with it, have like excite the world,

56:23.760 --> 56:30.560
 whether it's in the Carl Sagan style of like that calm, sexy voice of explaining the stars and all

56:30.560 --> 56:36.320
 the romantic stuff, or the Elon Musk, dare I even say Donald Trump, where you're like trolling and

56:36.320 --> 56:43.280
 shaking up the system and just saying controversial things. I talked to Lisa from a Barrett, who's

56:43.280 --> 56:51.600
 a neuroscientist who just enjoys playing the controversy, finds the counterintuitive ideas

56:51.600 --> 56:57.520
 in the particular science and throws them out there and sees how they play in the public discourse.

56:57.520 --> 57:02.960
 Like why don't we see more of that? And why does an academia attract an Elon Musk type?

57:03.520 --> 57:08.880
 Well, tenure is a powerful thing that allows you to do whatever you want. But getting tenure

57:09.840 --> 57:14.400
 typically requires you to be relatively narrow, right? Because people are judging you. Well,

57:14.400 --> 57:22.000
 I think the answer is we have told ourselves a story, a narrative that that is vulgar,

57:22.000 --> 57:30.880
 which we just described as vulgar. It's certainly unscientific, right? And it is easy to convince

57:30.880 --> 57:37.360
 yourself that in some ways, you're the mathematician, right? The fewer there are in your major,

57:37.920 --> 57:44.080
 the more that proves your purity, right? So once you tell yourself that story,

57:44.080 --> 57:52.160
 then it is beneath you to do that kind of thing, right? I think that's wrong. I think that... And

57:52.160 --> 57:54.320
 by the way, everyone doesn't have to do this. Everyone's not good at it. And everyone,

57:54.320 --> 57:59.680
 even if they would be good at it, would enjoy it. So it's fine. But I do think you need some diversity

57:59.680 --> 58:06.880
 in the way that people choose to relate to the world as academics, because I think the great

58:06.880 --> 58:13.920
 universities are ones that engage with the rest of the world. It is a home for public intellectuals.

58:14.800 --> 58:20.880
 And in 2020, being a public intellectual probably means being on Twitter. Whereas,

58:20.880 --> 58:25.120
 of course, that wasn't true 20 years ago, because Twitter wasn't around 20 years ago,

58:25.120 --> 58:27.840
 and if it was, it wasn't around in a meaningful way. I don't actually know how long Twitter's

58:27.840 --> 58:32.960
 been around. As I get older, I find that my notion of time has gotten worse and worse,

58:32.960 --> 58:39.920
 like Google really has been around that long. Anyway, the point is that I think that we sometimes

58:40.880 --> 58:46.240
 forget that a part of our job is to impact the people who aren't in the world that we're in,

58:46.240 --> 58:50.160
 and that that's the point of being at a great place and being a great person, frankly.

58:50.160 --> 58:54.240
 There's an interesting force in terms of public intellectuals. If we get Twitter,

58:54.240 --> 59:01.040
 we can look at just online courses that are public facing in some part. There is a kind of

59:01.040 --> 59:08.560
 force that pulls you back. Let me just call it off because I don't give a damn at this point.

59:09.600 --> 59:13.040
 There's a little bit of all of us have this, but certainly faculty have this,

59:13.040 --> 59:21.200
 which is jealousy. It's whoever is popular at being a good communicator, exciting the world

59:21.200 --> 59:27.840
 with their science. And of course, when you excite the world with the science, it's not

59:27.840 --> 59:36.960
 peer reviewed, clean. It all sounds like bullshit. It's like a TED talk. And people roll their eyes

59:36.960 --> 59:42.080
 and they hate that a TED talk gets millions of views or something like that. And then everybody

59:42.080 --> 59:47.200
 pulls each other back. There's this force that's just kind of, it's hard to stand out unless you

59:47.200 --> 59:54.720
 like win a Nobel Prize or whatever. It's only when you get senior enough, we just stop giving a damn.

59:54.720 --> 59:59.360
 But just like you said, even when you get tenure, that was always the surprising thing to me.

1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:06.000
 I have many colleagues and friends who have gotten tenure, but there's not a switch.

1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:15.120
 There's not an FU money switch where you're like, you know what, now I'm going to be more bold.

1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:20.160
 It doesn't, I don't see it. Well, there's a reason for that. Tenure isn't a test. It's a training

1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:25.520
 process. It teaches you to behave in a certain way, to think in a certain way, to accept certain

1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:30.160
 values and to react accordingly. And the better you are at that, the more likely you are to earn

1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:35.680
 tenure. And by the way, this is not a bad thing. Most things are like that. And I think most of

1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:39.600
 my colleagues are interested in doing great work and they're just having impact in the way that

1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:46.720
 they want to have impact. I do think that as a field, not just as a field, as a profession,

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:57.040
 but we have a habit of belittling those who are popular, as it were, as if the word itself is a

1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:07.680
 kind of scarlet A, right? I think it's easy to convince yourself and no one is immune to this

1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:13.040
 that the people who are better known are better known for bad reasons. The people who are out

1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:20.640
 there dumbing it down are not being pure to whatever the values and ethos is for your field.

1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:27.200
 And it's just very easy to do. Now, having said that, I think that ultimately, people who are

1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:31.840
 able to be popular and out there and are touching the world and making a difference,

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:38.880
 our colleagues do, in fact, appreciate that in the long run. It's just you have to be very good

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:42.800
 at it or you have to be very interested in pursuing it. And once you get past a certain level,

1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:46.560
 I think people accept that for who it is. I mean, I don't know. I'd be really interested

1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:51.280
 in how Rod Brooks felt about how people were interacting with him when he did fast, cheap,

1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:53.920
 and out of control way, way, way back when.

1:01:55.120 --> 1:01:56.240
 What's fast, cheap, and out of control?

1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:01.440
 It was a documentary that involved four people. I remember nothing about it other than Rod Brooks

1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:06.320
 was in it and something about naked mole rats. Can't remember what the other two things were.

1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:08.400
 It was robots, naked mole rats, and then two other.

1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:12.480
 By the way, Rod Brooks used to be the head of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at

1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:19.120
 MIT and then launched, I think, iRobot and then Think Robotics, Rethink Robotics.

1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:28.160
 Think is in the word and also is a little bit of a rock star personality in the AI world,

1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:32.480
 a very opinionated, very intelligent. Anyway, sorry, mole rats and naked.

1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:36.000
 Naked mole rats. Also, he was one of my two advisors for my PhD.

1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:37.840
 This explains a lot.

1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:44.240
 I love Rod. But I also live with my other advisor, Paul. Paul, if you're listening,

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:46.000
 I love you too. Both very, very different people.

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:46.560
 Paul Veol.

1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:49.760
 Paul Veol. Both very interesting people, very different in many ways.

1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:56.000
 But I don't know what Rod would say to you about what the reaction was. I know that for the

1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:01.520
 students at the time, because I was a student at the time, it was amazing, right? This guy was in

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:08.400
 a movie being very much himself. Actually, the movie version of him is a little bit more Rod

1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:13.840
 than Rod. I mean, I think they edited it appropriately for him. But it was very much Rod.

1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:17.680
 And he did all this while doing great work to me. Was he running the iLab at that point or

1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:21.840
 not? I don't know. But anyway, he's running the iLab or would be soon. He's a giant in the field.

1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:27.440
 He did amazing things, made a lot of his bones by doing the kind of counterintuitive science,

1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:30.640
 right? And saying, no, you're doing this all wrong. Representation is crazy.

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:33.600
 The world is your own representation. You just react to me. These are amazing things.

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:40.720
 And continues to do those sorts of things as he's moved on. I have, I think he might tell you,

1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:44.720
 I don't know if he would tell you it was good or bad, but I know that for everyone else out

1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:48.320
 there in the world, it was a good thing. And certainly, he continued to be respected. So

1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:50.560
 it's not as if it destroyed his career by being popular.

1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:57.520
 All right. Let's go into a topic where I'm on thin ice, because I grew up in the Soviet Union,

1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:08.320
 Russia, my knowledge of music. This American thing you guys do is quite foreign. So your

1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:13.920
 research group is called, as we've talked about, the Lab for Interactive Artificial Intelligence.

1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:20.240
 But also, there's just a bunch of mystery around this. My research fails me. Also called PFUNC.

1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:27.200
 Yep. P stands for probabilistic. And what does FUNC stand for?

1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:32.400
 So a lot of my life is about making acronyms. So if I have one quirk, it's that people will say

1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:37.520
 words and I see if they make acronyms. And if they do, then I'm happy. And then if they don't,

1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:42.320
 I try to change it so that they make acronyms. It's just a thing that I do. So PFUNC is an

1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:47.680
 acronym. It has three or four different meanings. But finally, I decided that the P stands for

1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:51.440
 probabilistic because at the end of the day, it's machine learning and it's randomness and

1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:56.400
 it's uncertainty, which is the important thing here. And the FUNC can be lots of different things,

1:04:56.400 --> 1:05:00.480
 but I decided I should leave it up to the individual to figure out exactly what it is.

1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:06.160
 But I will tell you that when my students graduate, when they get out, as we say at Tech,

1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:16.560
 I hand them, they put on a hat and starglasses and a medallion from the PFUNC era. And we take

1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:24.160
 a picture and I hand them a pair of fuzzy dice, which they get to keep. So there's a sense to it,

1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:30.400
 which is not an acronym, like literally FUNC. You have a dark mysterious past.

1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:40.880
 Oh, it's not dark. It's just fun. It's in hip hop and FUNC. So can you educate

1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:49.360
 a Soviet born Russian about this thing called hip hop? Like if you were to give me, you know,

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:56.480
 if we went on a journey together and you were trying to educate me about, especially the past

1:05:56.480 --> 1:06:01.440
 couple of decades in the 90s about hip hop or FUNC, what records or artists would you

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:12.160
 introduce me to? Would you tell me about or maybe what influenced you in your journey

1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:17.840
 or what you just love? Like when the family's gone and you just sit back and just blast some stuff

1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:22.400
 these days, what do you listen to? Well, so I listen to a lot, but I will tell you, well,

1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:26.400
 first off, all great music was made when I was 14. And that statement is true for all people,

1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:30.720
 no matter how old they are or where they live. But for me, the first thing that's

1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:34.480
 worth pointing out is that hip hop and rap aren't the same thing. So depending on what you talk

1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:38.480
 to about this, and there are people who feel very strongly about this, much more strongly.

1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:41.520
 You're offending everybody in this conversation. So this is great. Let's keep going.

1:06:42.240 --> 1:06:47.600
 Hip hop is a culture. It's a whole set of things of which rap is a part. So tagging is a part of

1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:50.720
 hip hop. I don't know why that's true, but people tell me it's true and I'm willing to go along

1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:54.880
 with it because they get very angry about it. But hip hop is like graffiti. Tagging is like graffiti.

1:06:55.680 --> 1:06:58.640
 And there's all these, including the popping and the locking and all the dancing and all those

1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:03.280
 things. That's all a part of hip hop. It's a way of life, which I think is true. And then there's

1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:09.360
 rap, which is this particular. It's the music part. Yes. A music part. I mean, you wouldn't

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:14.160
 call the stuff that DJs do the scratching. That's not rap, right? But it's a part of hip hop, right?

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:19.200
 So given that we understand that hip hop is this whole thing, what are the rap albums that

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:22.640
 best touched that for me? Well, if I were going to educate you, I would try to figure out what

1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:29.440
 you'd like. And then I would work you there. Skinner. Oh my God. I would probably start with

1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:37.360
 a supplement. There's a fascinating exercise. There's a fascinating exercise one can do by

1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:44.080
 watching old episodes of I love the 70s. I love the 80s. I love the 90s with a bunch of friends

1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:48.480
 and just see where people come in and out of pop culture. So if you're talking about

1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:53.760
 those people, then I would actually start you with where I would hope to start you with anyway,

1:07:53.760 --> 1:07:59.200
 which is public enemy. Particularly, it takes a nation of millions to hold us back, which is

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:05.200
 clearly the best album ever produced and certainly the best hip hop album ever produced, in part,

1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:10.000
 because it was so much of what was great about the time. Fantastic lyrics. Excuse me. It's all

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:15.200
 about the lyrics. Amazing music that was coming from Rick Rubin was the was the producer of that.

1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:20.640
 And he did a lot of very kind of heavy mental ish, at least in the 80s sense at the time.

1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:27.360
 And it was focused on politics in the 1980s, which was what made hip hop so great then.

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:31.600
 I would start you there, then I would move you up through things that have been happening more

1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:35.520
 recently. I'd probably get you to someone like a most deaf. I would give you a history lesson,

1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:39.920
 basically. Most deaf is amazing. He hosted a poetry jam thing on HBO or something like that.

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:43.280
 Probably. I don't think I've seen it, but I wouldn't be surprised. Yeah. Spoken poetry.

1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:48.800
 Spoken poetry. He's amazing. He's amazing. And then I would, after I got you there,

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:55.200
 I'd work you back to EPMD. And eventually, I would take you back to The Last Poets,

1:08:55.840 --> 1:09:01.280
 and particularly the first album, The Last Poets, which was 1970, to give you a sense of history

1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:06.720
 and that it actually has been building up over a very, very long time. So we would start there,

1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:10.880
 because that's where your music aligns. And then we would cycle out and I'd move you to the present

1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:14.720
 and then I'd take you back to the past. Because I think a large part of people who are kind of

1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:19.280
 confused about any kind of music, the truth is this is the same thing we've always been talking

1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:22.800
 about. It's about narrative and being a part of something and being immersed in something,

1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:29.440
 so you understand it, right? Jazz, which I also like, is one of the things that's cool about

1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:32.480
 jazz is that you come and you meet someone who's talking to you about jazz and you have no idea

1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:36.480
 what they're talking about. And then one day it all clicks and you've been so immersed in it,

1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:39.760
 you go, oh yeah, that's a Charlie Parker. You start using words that nobody else

1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:43.520
 understands, right? And it becomes a part of hip hop's the same way. Everything's the same way.

1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:47.120
 They're all cultural artifacts. But I would help you to see that there's a history of it and how

1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:52.400
 it connects to other genres of music that you might like to bring you in so that you could kind

1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:58.480
 of see how it connects to what you already like, including some of the good work that's been done

1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:08.000
 with fusions of hip hop and bluegrass. Oh no. Yes. Some of it's even good. Not all of it,

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.320
 but some of it is good. But I'd start you with, it takes a nation to make as a whole as back.

1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:18.800
 There's an interesting tradition and like more modern hip hop of integrating almost like classic

1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:25.440
 croc songs or whatever, like integrating into their music, into the beat, into the whatever.

1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:30.960
 It's kind of interesting. It gives a whole new, not just classic croc, but what is it,

1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:37.920
 the Kanye Gold Digger, the old R&B? Taking and pulling old R&B, right?

1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:41.120
 Well, that's been true since the beginning. I mean, in fact, that's in some ways,

1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:47.600
 that's why the DJ used to get top billing, because it was the DJ that brought all the records together

1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:51.520
 and made it worth so that people could dance. If you go back, you go back to those days,

1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:55.360
 mostly in New York, though not exclusively, but mostly in New York where it sort of came out of,

1:10:56.240 --> 1:10:59.840
 as the DJ that brought all the music together in the beats and showed that basically

1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:03.920
 music is itself an instrument, very meta. You can bring it together and then you sort of wrap

1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:09.360
 over it and so on. It moved that way. That's going way, way back. Now, in the period of time

1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:15.440
 where I grew up, when I became really into it, which was most of the 80s, it was more funk,

1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:20.480
 was the back for a lot of the stuff, public enemy at that time notwithstanding,

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:26.080
 which is very nice because it tied into what my parents listened to and what I vaguely remember

1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:32.480
 listening to when I was very small. And by the way, complete revival of George Clinton and Parliament

1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:37.120
 and Funkadelic and all of those things to bring it sort of back into the 80s and into the 90s.

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:42.320
 And as we go on, you're going to see the last decade and the decade before that being brought in.

1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:45.600
 And when you don't think that you're hearing something you've heard, it's probably because

1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:53.920
 it's being sampled by someone who, referring to something they remembered when they were young,

1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:58.960
 perhaps from somewhere else altogether. And you just didn't realize what it was because it wasn't

1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:02.080
 a popular song where you happened to grow up. So this stuff's been going on for a long time.

1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:08.480
 It's one of the things that I think is beautiful. Run DMC, Jam Master Jay used to play, he played

1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:13.200
 piano. He would record himself playing piano and then sample that to make it a part of what was

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:17.600
 going on rather than play the piano. That's how his mind can think. Well, it's pieces. You're

1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:20.480
 putting pieces together. You're putting pieces of music together to create new music, right?

1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:25.920
 Now, that doesn't mean that the roots are doing their own thing. Yeah. Those are, that's a whole.

1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:32.160
 Yeah. But still, it's the right attitude. And what else is jazz, right? Jazz is about

1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:35.200
 putting pieces together and then putting your own spin on. It's all the same. It's all the same

1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:40.240
 thing. It's all the same thing. Because you mentioned lyrics. It does make me sad. Again,

1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:46.000
 this is me talking trash about modern hip hop. I haven't, invest again. I'm sure people correct

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:49.520
 me that there's a lot of great artists. That's part of the reason I'm saying it is they'll

1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:54.720
 leave it in the comments that you should listen to this person is the lyrics went away from

1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:02.880
 talking about maybe not just politics, but life and so on. Like, you know, the kind of like

1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:07.600
 protest songs, even if you look at like a Bob Marley or you said public enemy or rage against

1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:14.880
 the machine more on the rock side. That's the place where we go to those lyrics. Like classic

1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:21.200
 rock is all about like my woman left me or or I'm really happy that she's still with me

1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:26.240
 or the flip side. It's like love songs of different kinds. It's all love, but it's less

1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:31.280
 political, like less interesting, I would say, in terms of like deep, profound knowledge. And

1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:38.000
 it seems like rap is the place where you would find that. And it's sad that for the most part,

1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.480
 what I see, like you look at like mumble rap or whatever, they're moving away from lyrics and

1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:47.040
 more towards the beat and the musicality of it. I've always been a fan of the lyrics. In fact,

1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:53.600
 if you go back in, you read my reviews, which I recently was reading. Man, I wrote my last review

1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:59.200
 the month I graduated. I got my PhD, which says something about something. I'm not sure what

1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:03.040
 though. I always would, I don't always, but I often would start with it's all about the lyrics.

1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:08.480
 For me, it's all it's about the lyrics. Someone has already written in the comments before I've

1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:12.000
 even finished having this conversation that, you know, neither of us knows what we're talking about.

1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:15.520
 And it's all in the underground hip hop. And here's who you should go listen to.

1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:21.600
 And that is true. Every time I despair for popular rap, someone points me to or I discover

1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:27.440
 some underground hip hop song and I'm made happy and whole again. So I know it's out there.

1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:33.120
 I don't listen to as much as I used to because I'm listening to podcasts and old music from

1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:37.440
 the 1980s. Kind of rap. No beat. It's a kind of, no, no beat at all. But you know, there's a little

1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:43.040
 bit of sampling here and there, I'm sure. By the way, James Brown is funk or no? Yes.

1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:47.600
 And so is Junior Wells, by the way. Who's that? Oh, Junior Wells, Chicago Blues.

1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:52.640
 He was James Brown before James Brown was. It's hard to imagine somebody being James Brown.

1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:59.840
 Go look up who do man blues, Junior Wells. And just listen to snatch it back and hold it.

1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:05.360
 And you'll see it. And they were contemporaries. Where do you put like Little Richard or all

1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:09.920
 that kind of stuff like Ray Charles, like when they get like, hit the road, Jack,

1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:13.920
 and don't you come back? Isn't that like, there's a funkiness in it?

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:17.520
 Oh, that's definitely a funkiness in it. I mean, it's all, I mean, it's all, it's all a line.

1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:21.760
 I mean, it's all, there's all a line that carries it all together. You know, it's,

1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:26.720
 I guess I have an answer question. I'm thinking about it in 2020 or I'm thinking about it in 1960.

1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:31.040
 I'd probably give a different answer. I'm just thinking in terms of, you know, that was rock.

1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:36.800
 But when you look back on it, it's, it was funky, but we didn't use those words. Or maybe we did.

1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:41.280
 I wasn't around. But you know, I don't think we use the word 1960 funk. Certainly not the way

1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:46.640
 we used it in the 70s and the 80s. Do you reject disco? I do not reject disco. I appreciate all the

1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:51.040
 mistakes that we have made to get there. Actually, some of the disco is actually really, really good.

1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:56.720
 John Travolta. Oh boy. He regrets it probably. Maybe not. Well, like it's the mistakes thing.

1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:02.640
 Yes. And it got him to where he's going, where he is. Oh, well, thank you for taking that detour.

1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:08.320
 You've, you've talked about computing where we've already talked about computing a little bit,

1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:14.320
 but can you try to describe how you think about the world of computing where it fits into the

1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:20.160
 sets of different disciplines? We mentioned College of Computing. What, what should people,

1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:24.080
 how should they think about computing, especially from an educational perspective

1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:32.640
 of like, what is the perfect curriculum that defines for a young mind what computing is?

1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:35.440
 So I don't know about a perfect curriculum, although that's an important question. Because

1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:39.680
 at the end of the day, without the curriculum, you don't get anywhere. Curriculum, to me,

1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:44.480
 is the fundamental data structure. It's not even the classroom. The world is, right? I,

1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:50.240
 so I think the curriculum is where I like to play. So I spent a lot of time thinking about this.

1:16:50.240 --> 1:16:53.040
 But I will tell you, I'll answer your question by answering a slightly different question first

1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:56.880
 than getting back to this, which is, you know, you talked about disciplines and what does it mean to,

1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:03.040
 to be a discipline. The truth is what we really educate people in from the beginning,

1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:06.640
 but certainly through college, you'd sort of failed if you don't think about it this way,

1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:14.000
 I think, is the world, people often think about tools and tool sets. And when you're really trying

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:18.640
 to be good, you think about skills and skill sets. But disciplines are about mindsets, right?

1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:24.160
 They're about fundamental ways of thinking, not just the, the, the hammer that you pick up whatever

1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:29.840
 that is to hit the nail, not just the, the skill of learning how to hammer well or whatever. It's

1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:35.920
 the mindset of like, what's the fundamental way to think about, to think about the world, right?

1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:40.240
 And disciplines, different disciplines give you different mindsets to give you different ways

1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:45.440
 of sort of thinking through. So with that in mind, I think that computing, even ask the question,

1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:48.720
 whether it's a discipline, is you have to decide, does it have a mindset? Does it have a way of

1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:53.280
 thinking about the world that is different from, you know, the scientist who is doing discover

1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:57.280
 and using the scientific method as a way of doing it, or the mathematician who builds abstractions

1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:02.400
 and tries to find sort of steady state truths about the abstractions that may be artificial,

1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:07.760
 but whatever. Or is it the engineer who's all about, you know, building demonstrably superior

1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:12.320
 technology with respect to some notion of tradeoffs, whatever that means, right? That's sort of the

1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:17.040
 world that you live in. What is computing? You know, how is computing different? So I've thought

1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:22.320
 about this for a long time, and I've come to a view about what computing actually is, what the

1:18:22.320 --> 1:18:27.200
 mindset is. And it's, you know, it's a little abstract, but that would be appropriate for computing.

1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:35.360
 I think that what distinguishes the computationalists from others is that he or she understands

1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:42.080
 that models, languages, and machines are equivalent. They're the same thing. And because

1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:47.440
 it's not just a model, but it's a machine that is an executable thing that can be described

1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:54.000
 as a language, that means that it's dynamic. So it's not the, it is mathematical in some sense,

1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:58.320
 in the kind of sense of abstraction, but it is fundamentally dynamic and executable. The

1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:03.120
 mathematician is not necessarily worried about either the dynamic part. In fact, whenever I

1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:08.080
 tried to write something for mathematicians, they invariably demand that I make it static.

1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:12.160
 And that's not a bad thing. It's just, it's a way of viewing the world that truth is a thing,

1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:17.920
 right? It's not a process that continually runs, right? So that dynamic thing matters,

1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:23.600
 that self reflection of the system itself matters. And that is what computing brought us. So it is

1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:28.960
 a science because the models fundamentally represent truths in the world. Information is

1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:33.920
 a scientific thing to discover, right? Not just a mathematical conceit that gets created. But,

1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:37.520
 of course, it's engineering because you're actually dealing with constraints in the world

1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:43.680
 and trying to execute machines that actually run. But it's also math because you're actually

1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:51.840
 worrying about these languages that describe what's happening. But the fact that regular

1:19:51.840 --> 1:19:56.960
 expressions and finite state automata, one of which feels like a machine or at least an abstraction

1:19:56.960 --> 1:20:00.160
 machine, the other is a language that they're actually the equivalent thing. I mean, that is

1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:04.320
 not a small thing. And it permeates everything that we do, even when we're just trying to figure

1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:10.560
 out how to do debugging. So that idea, I think, is fundamental. And we would do better if we made

1:20:10.560 --> 1:20:17.200
 that more explicit. How my life has changed in my thinking about this in the 10 or 15 years,

1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:23.360
 it's been since I tried to put that to paper with some colleagues, is the realization which

1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:29.200
 comes to a question you actually asked me earlier, which has to do with trees falling down and whether

1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:36.720
 it matters, is this sort of triangle of equality? It only matters because there's a person inside

1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:43.360
 the triangle, right? That what's changed about computing, computer science or whatever you want

1:20:43.360 --> 1:20:49.760
 to call it, is we now have so much data and so much computational power. We're able to do really,

1:20:49.760 --> 1:20:55.440
 really interesting, promising things. But the interesting and the promising kind of only

1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:59.760
 matters with respect to human beings and their relationship to it. So the triangle exists,

1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:04.320
 that is fundamentally computing. What makes it worthwhile and interesting and potentially

1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:11.040
 world species changing is that there are human beings inside of it and intelligence that has

1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:16.080
 to interact with it to change the data, the information that makes sense and gives meaning to

1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:20.320
 the models, the languages and the machines. So if the curriculum can

1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:26.080
 convey that while conveying the tools and the skills that you need in order to succeed,

1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:29.760
 then it is a big win. That's what I think you have to do.

1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:38.960
 Do you pull psychology, these human things into that, into the idea, into this framework of computing?

1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:43.120
 Do you pull in psychology, neuroscience, like parts of psychology, parts of neuroscience,

1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:48.480
 parts of sociology? What about philosophy, like studies of human nature from different

1:21:48.480 --> 1:21:52.800
 perspectives? Absolutely. And by the way, it works both ways. So let's take biology for a

1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:56.800
 moment. It turns out a cell is basically a bunch of if then statements. If you look at it the right

1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:01.680
 way, which is nice because I understand if then statements. I never really enjoyed biology,

1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:05.360
 but I do understand if then statements. And if you tell the biologists that and they begin to

1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:09.520
 understand that, it actually helps them to think about a bunch of really cool things.

1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:13.440
 There'll still be biology involved, but whatever. On the other hand, the fact

1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:18.080
 of biology is in fact a bunch of, the cell is a bunch of if then statements or whatever

1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:22.080
 allows the computationalists to think differently about the language and the way that we, well,

1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:25.120
 certainly the way we would do AI and machine learning, but it's just even the way that we

1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:30.240
 think about, we think about computation. So the important thing to me is, as you know,

1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:34.160
 my engineering colleagues who are not in computer science worry about computer science eating up

1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:40.560
 engineering to colleges where computer science is trapped. It's not a worry. You shouldn't

1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:44.800
 worry about that at all. Computing is computer science computing. It's not, it's central,

1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:48.960
 but it's not the most important thing in the world. It's not more important. It is just key

1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:53.840
 to helping others do other cool things they're going to do. You're not going to be a historian

1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:57.120
 in 2030. You're not going to get a PhD in history without understanding some data science and

1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:01.840
 computing because the way you're going to get history done in part, and I say done, the way

1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:05.120
 you're going to get it done is you're going to look at data and you're going to let,

1:23:05.120 --> 1:23:08.000
 you're going to have a system that's going to help you to analyze things to help you to think

1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:12.000
 about a better way to describe history and to understand what's going on and what it tells us

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:15.280
 about where we might be going. The same is true for psychology, same true for all of these things.

1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:20.000
 The reason I brought that up is because the philosopher has a lot to say about computing.

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:24.000
 The psychologist has a lot to say about the way humans interact with computing, right?

1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:30.960
 And certainly a lot about intelligence, which for me, ultimately is kind of the goal of building

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:33.440
 these computational devices is to build something intelligent.

1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:38.480
 Did you think computing will eat everything in some certain sense or almost like disappear

1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:41.680
 because it's part of everything? It's so funny you say this. I want to say it's

1:23:41.680 --> 1:23:45.840
 going to metastasize, but there's kind of two ways that fields destroy themselves.

1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:52.400
 One is they become super narrow, and I think we can think of fields that might be that way.

1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:58.000
 They become pure, and we have that instinct. We have that impulse. I'm sure you can think of

1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:03.360
 several people who want computer science to be this pure thing. The other way is you become

1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:08.880
 everywhere and you become everything and nothing. And so everyone says, I'm going to teach Fortran

1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:13.200
 for engineers or whatever. I'm going to do this. And then you lose the thing that makes it worth

1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:18.240
 studying in and of itself. The thing about computing, and this is not unique to computing,

1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:23.520
 though at this point in time it is distinctive about computing where we happen to be in 2020,

1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:28.880
 is we are both a thriving major. In fact, the thriving major almost every place.

1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:37.280
 And we're a service unit because people need to know the things we need to know. And our job,

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:41.760
 much as the mathematician's job is to help this person over here to think like a mathematician

1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:47.120
 much the way the point of you taking chemistry as a freshman is not to learn chemistry. It's to

1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:51.840
 learn to think like a scientist. Our job is to help them to think like a computationalist.

1:24:51.840 --> 1:24:55.040
 And we have to take both of those things very seriously. And I'm not sure that

1:24:55.920 --> 1:25:00.160
 as a field, we have historically certainly taken the second thing that our job is to

1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:03.120
 help them to think a certain way. People who aren't going to be on me, I don't think we've

1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:08.320
 taken that very seriously at all. I don't know if you know who Dan Carlin is. He has this podcast

1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:14.240
 called Hardcore History. Yes. I've just did an amazing four hour conversation with him,

1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:21.360
 mostly about Hitler. But I bring him up because he talks about this idea that it's possible that

1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:30.240
 history as a field will become like currently most people study history a little bit, kind of

1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:34.640
 are aware of it. We have a conversation about it, different parts of it. I mean, there's a lot of

1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:38.640
 criticism to say that some parts of history are being ignored, blah, blah, blah, blah, so on.

1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:47.200
 But most people are able to have a curiosity and able to learn it. His thought is it's possible

1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:52.960
 given the way social media works, the current way we communicate, that history becomes a niche

1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:59.440
 field where literally most people just ignore because everything is happening so fast that

1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:04.400
 the history starts losing its meaning. And then it starts being a thing that only,

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:10.240
 you know, like the theoretical computer science part of computer science, it becomes a niche

1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:17.520
 thing that only like the rare holders of the world wars and the, you know, all the history,

1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:23.920
 the founding of the United States, all those kinds of things, the civil wars. And it's a kind of

1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:32.080
 profound thing to think about how we can lose track, how we can lose these fields when they're

1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:37.760
 best, like in the case of history, is best for that to be a pervasive thing that everybody

1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:45.520
 learns and thinks about and so on. And I would say computing is quite obviously similar to history

1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:51.360
 in the sense that it seems like it should be a part of everybody's life to some degree,

1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:57.520
 especially like as we move into the later parts of the 21st century. And it's not obvious that

1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:03.920
 that's the way it'll go. It might be in the hands of the few still, like it, depending if it's machine

1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:09.760
 learning, you know, it's unclear that it'll, computing will win out. It's currently very

1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:14.560
 successful, but it's not, I would say that's something, I mean, you're at the leadership

1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:19.840
 level of this, you're defining the future. So it's in your hands. No pressure. But like,

1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:25.840
 it feels like there's multiple ways this can go. And there's this kind of conversation of everybody

1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:34.960
 should learn to code, right? The changing nature of jobs and so on. Do you have a sense of what

1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:42.800
 your role in education of computing is here? Like, what's the hopeful path forward?

1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:46.720
 There's a lot there. I will say that, well, first off, it would be an absolute shame

1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:52.160
 if no one studied history. On the other hand, as T approaches infinity, the amount of history

1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:59.440
 is presumably also growing at least linearly. And so it's, you have to forget more and more

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:02.960
 of history. But history needs to always be there. I mean, I can imagine a world where,

1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:07.360
 you know, if you think of your brains as being outside of your head, that you can kind of learn

1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:11.280
 the history you need to know when you need to know it, that seems fanciful. But it's a,

1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:16.400
 it's a kind of way of, you know, is there a sufficient statistic of history? No. And there's

1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:19.600
 certainly, but there may be for the particular thing you have to care about. But, you know,

1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:23.040
 those who do not remember. It's for our objective camera discussion, right?

1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:26.320
 Yeah. Right. And, you know, we've already lost lots of history. And of course,

1:28:26.320 --> 1:28:29.920
 you have your own history that some of which will be, or it's even lost to you, right? You

1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:34.400
 don't even remember whatever it was you were doing 17 years ago. All the ex girlfriends.

1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:40.960
 Yeah. Gone. Exactly. So, you know, history is being lost anyway, but the big lessons of history

1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:45.440
 shouldn't be. And I think, you know, to take it to the question of computing and sort of

1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:49.120
 education, the point is you have to get across those lessons. You have to get across the way

1:28:49.120 --> 1:28:54.480
 of thinking. And you have to be able to go back and, you know, you don't want to lose the data,

1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:57.680
 even if, you know, you don't necessarily have the information at your fingertips.

1:28:57.680 --> 1:29:02.640
 With computing, I think it's somewhat different. Everyone doesn't have to learn how to code,

1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:07.680
 but everyone needs to learn how to think in the way that you can be precise. And I mean,

1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:13.600
 precise in the sense of repeatable, not just, you know, in the sense of not resolution in the

1:29:13.600 --> 1:29:19.360
 sense of get the right number of bits. In saying what it is you want the machine to do,

1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:25.840
 and being able to describe a problem in such a way that it is executable, which we are not,

1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:29.600
 human beings are not very good at that. In fact, I think we spend much of our time talking back

1:29:29.600 --> 1:29:33.200
 and forth just to kind of vaguely understand what the other person means and hope we get

1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:38.240
 it good enough that we can act accordingly. You can't do that with machines, at least not yet.

1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:45.520
 And so, you know, having to think that precisely about things is quite important. And that's

1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:52.000
 somewhat different from coding. Coding is a crude means to an end. On the other hand,

1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:56.960
 the idea of coding, what that means, that it's a programming language and it has these sort of

1:29:56.960 --> 1:30:00.720
 things that you fiddle with in these ways that you express, that is an incredibly important

1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:05.120
 point. In fact, I would argue that one of the big holes in machine learning right now in AI is

1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:13.440
 that we forget that we are basically doing software engineering. We forget that we are using programming.

1:30:13.440 --> 1:30:16.720
 We're using languages to express what we're doing. We get just all caught up in the deep

1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:22.640
 network or we get all caught up in whatever that we forget that, you know, we're making decisions

1:30:22.640 --> 1:30:26.880
 based upon a set of parameters that we made up. And if we did slightly different parameters,

1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:31.040
 we'd have completely different outcomes. And so, the lesson of computing, computer science

1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:36.640
 education is to be able to think like that and to be aware of it when you're doing it.

1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:40.560
 Basically, at the end of the day, it's a way of surfacing your assumptions.

1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:45.760
 I mean, we call them parameters or, you know, we call them if then statements or whatever,

1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:50.320
 but you're forced to surface those assumptions. That's the key. The key thing that you should

1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:53.520
 get out of a computing education, that and that the models and languages and the machines are

1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:59.040
 equivalent. But it actually follows from that that you have to be explicit about what it is

1:30:59.040 --> 1:31:03.360
 you're trying to do because the model you're building is something you will one day run.

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:08.960
 So, you better get it right or at least understand it and be able to express roughly what you want

1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:18.000
 to express. So, I think it is key that we figure out how to educate everyone to think that way

1:31:18.960 --> 1:31:23.520
 because at the end, it would not only make them better at whatever it is that they

1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:30.080
 are doing and I emphasize doing, it'll also make them better citizens. It'll help them to

1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:35.680
 understand what others are doing to them so that they can react accordingly because you're not

1:31:35.680 --> 1:31:39.600
 going to solve the problem of social media insofar as you think of social media as a problem

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:47.520
 by just making slightly better code, right? It only works if people react to it appropriately

1:31:47.520 --> 1:31:53.520
 and know what's happening and therefore take control over what they're doing. I mean, that's

1:31:53.520 --> 1:32:02.160
 my take on it. Okay. Let me try to proceed awkwardly into the topic of race. Okay. One is because

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:06.720
 it's a fascinating part of your story and you're just eloquent and fun about it and then the second

1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:14.080
 is because we're living through a pretty tense time in terms of race, tensions and discussions

1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:22.960
 and ideas in this time in America. You grew up in Atlanta, not born in Atlanta. Is some

1:32:22.960 --> 1:32:28.720
 southern state somewhere in Tennessee, something like that? Tennessee. Nice. Okay. But early on,

1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:38.800
 you moved, you're basically, you identify as an Atlanta native. Yeah. And you've mentioned that

1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:44.880
 you grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood. By the way, black African American personal color.

1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:50.720
 I prefer black. Black. With a capital B. With a capital B. The other letters are.

1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:58.880
 The rest of them. Okay. So the predominantly black neighborhood. And so you didn't almost see

1:32:58.880 --> 1:33:04.720
 race. Maybe you can correct me on that. And then in the video you talked about when you

1:33:04.720 --> 1:33:12.000
 showed up to Georgia Tech for your undergrad. You're one of the only black folks there. And

1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:19.280
 that was like, oh, that was a new experience. So can you take me from just a human perspective,

1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:24.000
 but also from a race perspective, your journey growing up in Atlanta and then showing up at

1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:29.200
 Georgia Tech. Okay. And by the way, that story continues through MIT as well. In fact, it was

1:33:29.200 --> 1:33:36.240
 quite a bit more stark at MIT and Boston. So maybe just a quick pause. Georgia Tech was undergrad.

1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:42.960
 MIT was graduate school. And I went directly to grad school from undergrad. So I had no distractions

1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:47.760
 in between my bachelor's and my master's and PhD. You didn't go on a backpacking trip in Europe?

1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:52.640
 Didn't do any of that. In fact, I literally went to IBM for three months, got in a car,

1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:57.760
 and drove straight to Boston with my mother or Cambridge. Yeah. Moved into an apartment I've

1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:03.360
 never seen over the Royal East. Anyway, that's another story. So let me tell you a little bit

1:34:03.360 --> 1:34:09.120
 about this. You miss MIT? Oh, I loved MIT. I don't miss Boston at all, but I loved MIT.

1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:14.000
 And that was fighting war. So let's back up to this. So as you said, I was born in Chattanooga,

1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:17.840
 Tennessee. My earliest memory is arriving in Atlanta in a moving truck at the age of three

1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:21.360
 and a half. So I think of myself as being from Atlanta. I'm a very distinct memory of that.

1:34:21.360 --> 1:34:26.800
 So I grew up in Atlanta. It's the only place I ever knew as a kid. I loved it. Like much

1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:32.400
 of the country and certainly much of Atlanta in the 70s and 80s, it was deeply highly segregated,

1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:38.240
 though not in a way that I think was obvious to you unless you were looking at it or were old enough

1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:42.480
 to have noticed it. But you could divide up Atlanta and Atlanta is hardly unique in this way

1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:48.160
 by highway and you could get race and class that way. So I grew up not only in a predominantly black

1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:56.400
 area to say the very least, I grew up on the poor side of that. But I was very much aware of race

1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:01.440
 for a bunch of reasons, one that people made certain that I was, my family did, but also that

1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:08.320
 it would come up. So in first grade, I had a girlfriend. I say I had a girlfriend. I didn't

1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:13.200
 have a girlfriend. I wasn't even entirely sure what girls were in the first grade. But I do remember

1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:17.680
 she decided I was her girlfriend's little white girl named Heather. And we had a long discussion

1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:21.440
 about how it was okay for us to be boyfriend and girlfriend, despite the fact that she was white

1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:26.880
 and I was black. Between the two of you? Between the two. Did your parents know about this? Yes,

1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:31.520
 but being a girlfriend and boyfriend in first grade just basically meant that you spent slightly

1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:37.120
 more time together during recess. It had no, I think we Eskimo kissed once. It doesn't mean,

1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:41.120
 it didn't mean anything. It was at the time, it felt very scandalous because everyone was watching.

1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:45.520
 I was like, ah, my life is, now my life has changed in first grade. No one told me elementary

1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:49.520
 school would be like this. Did you write poetry or? Not in first grade. That would come later.

1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:55.840
 Okay. That would come during puberty when I wrote lots and lots of poetry. Anyway, so I was aware

1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:00.800
 of it. I didn't think too much about it, but I was aware of it. But I was surrounded. It wasn't

1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:07.120
 that I wasn't aware of race. It's that I wasn't aware that I was a minority. It's different. And

1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:11.360
 it's because I wasn't. As far as my world was concerned, I mean, I'm six years old, five years

1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:16.560
 old in first grade. The world is the seven people I see every day. So it didn't feel that way at all.

1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:21.840
 And by the way, this being Atlanta, home of the civil rights movement and all the rest,

1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:25.600
 it meant that when I looked at TV, which back then one did because there were only three,

1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:29.280
 four or five channels, right? And I saw the news, which my mother might make me watch,

1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:37.200
 the Monica Kaufman was on TV telling me the news and they were all black and the mayor was black

1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:42.080
 and always been black. And so it just never occurred to me. When I went to Georgia Tech,

1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:48.000
 I remember the first day walking across campus from West Campus to East Campus and realizing

1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.240
 along the way that of the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of students that I was seeing,

1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:59.440
 I was the only black one. That was enlightening and very off putting because it occurred to me.

1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:04.480
 And then of course, it continued that way for, well, for the rest of my, for much of the rest

1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:08.400
 of my career at Georgia Tech. Of course, I found lots of other students and I met people because

1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:13.520
 in Atlanta, you're either black or you're white, there was nothing else. So I began to meet students

1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:17.680
 of Asian descent and I met students who we would call Hispanic and so on and so forth. And, you

1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:21.120
 know, so my world, this is what college is supposed to do, right? It's supposed to open you up to

1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:29.200
 people and it did. But it was a very strange thing to be in the minority. When I came to Boston,

1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:37.600
 I will tell you a story. I applied to one place as an undergrad, Georgia Tech, because I was

1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:41.840
 stupid. I didn't know any better numbers. It didn't know any better, right? No one told me.

1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:46.320
 When I went to grad school, I applied to three places, Georgia Tech, because that's where I was,

1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:58.000
 MIT and CMU. When I got in to MIT, I got into CMU, but I had a friend who went to CMU. And so I

1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:01.680
 asked him what he thought about it. He spent his time explaining to me about Pittsburgh,

1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:06.720
 much less about CMU, but more about Pittsburgh, which I developed a strong opinion based upon

1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:11.120
 his strong opinion, something about the sun coming out two days out of the year. And I

1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:15.040
 didn't get a chance to go there because the timing was wrong. I think it was because the timing was

1:38:15.040 --> 1:38:24.000
 wrong. At MIT, I asked 20 people I knew, either when I visited or I had already known for a variety

1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:29.840
 of reasons, whether they liked Boston. And 10 of them loved it and 10 of them hated it. The 10 who

1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:35.040
 loved it were all white. The 10 who hated it were all black. And they explained to me very much why

1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:41.280
 that was the case. Both stats told me why. And the stories were remarkably the same for the two

1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:46.800
 clusters. And I came up here and I could see it immediately, why people would love it and why

1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:52.000
 people would not. And why people tell you about the nice coffee shops. Well, when coffee shops,

1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:57.040
 it was used CD places. But yeah, it was that kind of a thing. Nice shops. Oh, there's all these

1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:00.800
 students here. Harvard Square is beautiful. You can do all these things and you can walk

1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:04.480
 in something about the outdoors, which I was a bit interested in. The outdoors is for the bugs.

1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:11.040
 It's not for humans. That should be a t shirt. Yeah, I mean, it's the way I feel about it.

1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:15.920
 And the black folk told me completely different stories about which part of town

1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:22.000
 you did not want to be caught in after dark. And I heard all, but that was nothing new.

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:27.600
 So I decided that MIT was a great place to be as a university. And I believed it then,

1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:32.160
 I believe it now. And that whatever it is I wanted to do, I thought I knew what I wanted to do,

1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:36.960
 but what if I was wrong? Someone there would know how to do it. Of course, then I would pick the

1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:42.320
 one topic that nobody was working on at the time, but that's okay. It was great. And so I thought

1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:46.480
 that I would be fine and not only be there for like four or five years, I told myself,

1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:50.320
 which turned out not to be true at all. But I enjoyed my time. I enjoyed my time there.

1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:57.680
 But I did see a lot of, I ran across a lot of things that were driven by what I look like.

1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:03.760
 While I was here, I got asked a lot of questions. I ran into a lot of cops. I did a,

1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:08.640
 I saw a lot about the city, but at the time, I mean, I haven't been here a long time. These are

1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:15.440
 the things that I remember. So this is 1990. There was not a single black radio station.

1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:19.920
 Now this is 1990. There aren't, I don't know if there are any radio stations anymore. I'm sure

1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:23.040
 there are, but you know, I don't listen to the radio anymore and almost no one does.

1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:28.000
 At least if you're under a certain age. But the idea is you could be in a major

1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:31.120
 metropolitan area and there wasn't a single black radio station, by which I mean a radio

1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:38.080
 station to play what we would call black music then, was absurd, but somehow captured kind of

1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:42.800
 everything about the city. I grew up in Atlanta and, you know, you've heard me tell you about

1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:50.320
 Atlanta. Boston had no economically viable or socially cohesive black middle class.

1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:56.240
 Insofar as it existed, it was uniformly distributed throughout large parts, not all

1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:00.240
 parts, but large parts of the city. You know, where you had concentrated concentrations

1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:06.000
 of black Bostonians, they tended to be poor. It was very different from where I grew up.

1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:10.880
 I grew up on the poor side of town, sure. But then in high school, well, in ninth grade,

1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:14.800
 we didn't have middle school. I went to an eighth grade school where there was a lot of,

1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:19.040
 let's just say we had a riot the year that I was there. There was at least one major fight

1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:25.760
 every week. It was an amazing, it was an amazing experience. But when I went to ninth grade, I

1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:31.920
 went to academy. Math and science academy at Mays High. It was a public school. It was a

1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:36.240
 magnet school. That's why I was able to go there. It was the first school, high school,

1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:40.560
 I think in the state of Georgia, to sweep the state math and science fairs. It was great.

1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:50.400
 It had 385 students, all but four of whom were black. I went to school with the daughter of

1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:55.760
 the former mayor of Atlanta, Michael Jackson's cousin. I mean, you know, there was, it was an

1:41:55.760 --> 1:41:59.840
 upper middle class. Dropping names. You know, I just dropped names occasionally. You know,

1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:03.600
 drop the mic, drop some names. Just to let you know, I used to hang out with Michael Jackson's

1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:08.240
 cousin, 12 cousin, nine guys removed. I don't know. The point is, they had my, we had a parking

1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:12.480
 problem because the kids had cars. I did not come from a place where you had cars. I had my

1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:20.480
 first car when I came to MIT actually. So it was, it was just a, it was just a very, very

1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:24.880
 different experience for me. But I had been to places where whether you were rich or whether

1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:28.560
 you were poor, you know, you could be black and rich or black and poor and it was there and there

1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:34.880
 were places and they were segregated by class as well as by race. But that existed here, at least

1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:39.360
 when I was here, didn't feel that way at all. And it felt like a bunch of a really interesting

1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:46.080
 contradiction. It felt like it was the interracial dating capital of the country.

1:42:46.080 --> 1:42:46.800
 Yeah.

1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:52.320
 You really felt that way. But it also felt like the most racist place I ever spent any time.

1:42:54.080 --> 1:42:58.080
 You know, you couldn't go up the orange line at that time. I mean, again, that was 30 years ago.

1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:02.960
 I don't know what it's like now, but there were places you couldn't go and you knew it.

1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:08.320
 Everybody knew it. And there were places you couldn't live and everybody knew that.

1:43:09.440 --> 1:43:12.720
 And that was just the greater Boston area in 1992.

1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:14.880
 Southern racism or explicit racism?

1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:15.120
 Both.

1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:23.200
 In terms of within the institutions, did you feel, was, okay, was there levels in which you

1:43:23.200 --> 1:43:29.520
 were empowered to be first or one of the first black people in a particular discipline in

1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:34.560
 in some of these great institutions that you were part of, Georgia Tech or MIT?

1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:38.560
 And was there a part where it was felt limiting?

1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:45.680
 I always felt empowered. Some of that was my own delusion, I think, but it worked out.

1:43:46.240 --> 1:43:52.320
 So I never felt, in fact, quite the opposite. Not only did I not feel as if no one was

1:43:52.320 --> 1:43:57.360
 trying to stop me. I had the distinct impression that people wanted me to succeed.

1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:02.320
 By people, I meant the people in power. Not my fellow students. Not that they didn't want me

1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:10.560
 to succeed. But I felt supported, or at least that people were happy to see me succeed at least

1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:16.240
 as much as anyone else. But 1990, you're dealing with a different set of problems, which you're

1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:20.720
 very early, at least in computer science, you're very early in the sort of Jackie Robinson period.

1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:25.120
 There's this thing called the Jackie Robinson syndrome, which is that you have to,

1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:30.240
 you know, the first one has to be perfect, or has to be sure to succeed because if that person

1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:35.120
 fails, no one else comes after for a long time. So, you know, it was kind of in everyone's best

1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:40.000
 interest. But I think it came from a sincere place. I'm completely sure that people went out

1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:45.760
 of their way to try to make certain that the environment would be good, not just for me,

1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:49.200
 but for the other people who, of course, were around. And I was hardly the only person in

1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:55.840
 the iLab, but I wasn't the only person in MIT by a long shot. On the other hand, we were what? At

1:44:55.840 --> 1:45:00.720
 that point, we would have been, what, less than 20 years away from the first black PhD to graduate

1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:06.240
 from MIT, right? Shirley Jackson, right? 1971, something like that, somewhere around then.

1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:12.800
 So, we weren't that far away from the first first. And we were still another eight years away from

1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:19.760
 the first black PhD to computer science, right? So, it was a sort of interesting time. But I

1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:27.920
 did not feel as if the institutions of the university were against any of that. And furthermore,

1:45:27.920 --> 1:45:33.520
 I felt as if there was enough of a critical mass across the institute from students and probably

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:38.400
 faculty that I didn't know them, who wanted to make certain that the right thing happened.

1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:43.520
 That's very different from the institutions of the rest of the city, which I think were

1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:46.800
 designed in such a way that they felt no need to be supportive.

1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:55.600
 Let me ask a touchy question on that. So, you kind of said that you didn't feel,

1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:05.200
 you felt empowered. Is there some lesson advice in the sense that no matter what,

1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:12.640
 you should feel empowered. You should use the word, I think, illusion or delusion. Is there a sense

1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:31.040
 from the individual perspective where you should always kind of ignore the little forces that you

1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:37.040
 are able to observe around you that are trying to mess with you of whether it's jealousy, whether

1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:43.840
 it's hatred in its pure form, whether it's just hatred in its deluded form, all that kind of

1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:49.680
 stuff, and just kind of see yourself as empowered and confident in all those kinds of things.

1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:53.280
 I mean, it certainly helps. But there's a tradeoff, right? You have to be deluded enough to think

1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:56.880
 that you can succeed. I mean, you can't get a PhD unless you're crazy enough to think you can

1:46:56.880 --> 1:47:02.080
 invent something that no one else has come up with. I mean, that kind of massive delusion is that.

1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:05.600
 So, you have to be deluded enough to believe that you can succeed despite whatever odds you see

1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:08.960
 in front of you. But you can't be so deluded that you don't think that you need to step out of the

1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:14.000
 way of the oncoming train. So, it's all a tradeoff, right? You have to kind of believe in yourself.

1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:19.280
 It helps to have a support group around you in some way or another. I was able to find that.

1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:23.520
 I've been able to find that wherever I've gone, even if it wasn't necessarily on the floor that

1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:28.240
 I was in. I had lots of friends when I was here. Many of them still live here. And I've kept up

1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:32.560
 with many of them. So, I felt supported. And certainly, I had my mother and my family and

1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:38.640
 those people back home that I could always lean back on, even if it were a long distance call

1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:42.960
 that cost money, which is not something that any of the kids today even know what I'm talking about.

1:47:42.960 --> 1:47:47.680
 But back then, it mattered calling my mom was an expensive proposition. But you have that,

1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:52.720
 and it's fine. I think it helps. But you cannot be so deluded that you miss the obvious because

1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:57.360
 it makes things slower. And it makes you think you're doing better than you are. And it will hurt

1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:05.920
 you in the long run. You mentioned cops. You tell the story of being pulled over. Perhaps it happened

1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:12.640
 more than once. More than once, for sure. One, could you tell that story? And in general, can you

1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:24.080
 give me a sense of what the world looks like when the law doesn't always look at you with the blank

1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:35.600
 slate with objective eyes? I don't know how to say it more poetically. Well, I guess I don't

1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:40.720
 either. I guess the answer is it looks exactly the way it looks now because this is the world that

1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:46.480
 we happen to live in, right? It's people clustering and doing the things that they do and making

1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:52.880
 decisions based on one or two bits of information they find relevant, which, by the way, are all

1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:57.760
 positive feedback loops, which makes it easier for you to believe what you believed before because

1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:01.360
 you behave in a certain way that makes it true and it goes on and circles and cycles and cycles

1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:11.120
 and cycles. So it's just about being on edge. I do not, despite having made it over 50 now.

1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:16.080
 Congratulations, brother. Thank you. God, I have a few gray hairs here and there.

1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:23.680
 You did pretty good. I think, you know, I don't imagine I will ever see a police officer and not

1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:30.160
 get very, very tense. Now, everyone gets a little tense because it probably means you're being pulled

1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:34.400
 over for speeding or something or you're going to get a ticket or whatever, right? I mean,

1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:39.280
 the interesting thing about the law in general is that most human beings experience of it is

1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:44.400
 fundamentally negative, right? You're only dealing with the lawyer if you're in trouble,

1:49:44.400 --> 1:49:50.320
 except in a few very small circumstances, right? So that's just an underlying reality. Now,

1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:54.400
 imagine that that's also at the hands of the police officer. I remember at the time when I was,

1:49:54.400 --> 1:50:02.560
 when I got pulled over that time, halfway between Boston and Wellesley, actually. I remember thinking

1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:10.240
 as he, when he pulled his gun on me that if he shot me right now, he'd get away with it.

1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:16.480
 That was the worst thing that I felt about that particular moment is that if he shoots me now,

1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:24.800
 he will get away with it. It would be years later when I realized actually much worse than that is

1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:30.880
 that he'd get away with it. And if anyone, if it became a thing that other people knew about,

1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:34.240
 odds would be, of course, that it wouldn't. But if it became a thing that other people knew about,

1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:40.000
 if I was living in today's world as opposed to the world 30 years ago, that not only we get away

1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:45.920
 with it, but that I would be painted a villain. I was probably big and scary and I probably moved

1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:49.760
 too fast and if only I'd done what he said and da, da, da, da, da, da, da, which is somehow

1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:56.160
 worse, right? You, you know, that hurts not just you, you're dead. But your family and the way

1:50:56.160 --> 1:51:02.320
 people look at you and look at your legacy or your history, that's terrible. And it would work. I

1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:06.080
 absolutely believe it would have worked had he done it. Now, he didn't. I don't think he wanted to

1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:10.240
 shoot me when he felt like killing your body. Did not go out that night expecting to do that or

1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:14.880
 planning on doing it. And I wouldn't be surprised if he never ever did that or ever even pulled

1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:18.000
 his gun again. I don't know the man's name. I don't remember anything about him. I do remember

1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:21.280
 the gun. Guns are very big when they're in your face. I can tell you this much. They're much

1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:26.000
 larger than they seem. But and you're basically like speeding or something like that. He said I

1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:30.480
 ran a light. I ran a light. I don't think I ran a light. But you know, in fact, I may not have

1:51:30.480 --> 1:51:34.400
 even gotten a ticket. I may have just gotten a warning. I think he was a little. But he pulled

1:51:34.400 --> 1:51:39.120
 a gun. Yeah. Apparently I moved too fast or something. Rolled my window down before I should

1:51:39.120 --> 1:51:43.360
 have. It's unclear. I think he thought I was going to do something or at least that's how he

1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:48.960
 behaved. So how if we can take a little walk around your brain,

1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:58.960
 how do you feel about that guy and how do you feel about cops after that experience?

1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:03.760
 Well, I don't remember that guy. But my views on police officers is the same view I have about

1:52:03.760 --> 1:52:12.560
 lots of things. Fire is an important and necessary thing in the world. But you must respect fire

1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:18.240
 because it will burn you. Fire is a necessary evil in the sense that it can burn you

1:52:18.800 --> 1:52:23.440
 necessary in the sense that, you know, heat and all the other things that we use fire for. So

1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:31.040
 when I see a cop, I see a giant ball of flame. And I just try to avoid it.

1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:36.880
 And then some people might see a nice place, a nice thing to roast marshmallows with family over.

1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:39.280
 Which is fine. I don't roast marshmallows.

1:52:39.280 --> 1:52:44.800
 Okay. So let me go a little darker. I apologize. Just talked to Dan Carlin about it over four

1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:54.160
 hours. So sorry if I go dark here a little bit. But is it easy for this experience of

1:52:54.160 --> 1:52:57.840
 just being careful with the fire and avoiding it to turn to hatred?

1:52:58.400 --> 1:53:01.040
 Yeah, of course. And one might even argue that it is a

1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:07.840
 a logical conclusion, right? On the other hand, you've got to live in the world. And

1:53:09.760 --> 1:53:17.120
 I don't think it's helpful. Hate is something that takes a lot of energy.

1:53:17.840 --> 1:53:24.160
 So one should reserve it for when it is useful and not carry it around with you all the time.

1:53:24.160 --> 1:53:29.120
 Again, there's a big difference between the happy delusion that convinces you that you can

1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:34.240
 actually get out of bed and make it to work today without getting hit by a car. And the

1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:39.600
 sad delusion that means you can not worry about this car that is barreling towards you, right?

1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:44.800
 So we all have to be a little deluded because otherwise we're paralyzed, right? But one should

1:53:44.800 --> 1:53:49.280
 not be ridiculous. We go all the way back to something you said earlier about empathy.

1:53:49.280 --> 1:54:00.080
 I think what I would ask other people to get out of this one of many, many, many stories

1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:07.120
 is to recognize that it is real. People would ask me to empathize with the police officer.

1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:13.440
 I would quote back statistics saying that being a police officer isn't even in the top 10 most

1:54:13.440 --> 1:54:17.440
 dangerous jobs in the United States, you're much more likely to be killed in a taxicab.

1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:24.720
 Half of police officers are actually killed by suicide. But that means their lives are

1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:30.160
 something. Something's going on there with them. And I would more than happy to be empathetic about

1:54:30.160 --> 1:54:35.440
 what it is they go through and how they see the world. I think, though, that if we step back from

1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:40.080
 what I feel and we step back from what an individual police officer feels,

1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:44.560
 you step up a level and all this because all things tie back into interactive AR.

1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:49.600
 The real problem here is that we've built a narrative. We built a big structure that has

1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:54.880
 made it easy for people to put themselves into different pots in the different clusters and to

1:54:57.360 --> 1:55:01.120
 basically forget that the people in the other clusters are ultimately like them.

1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:07.040
 It is a useful exercise to ask yourself sometimes, I think, that if I had grown up in a completely

1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:10.240
 different house and a completely different household as a completely different person,

1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:14.720
 if I had been a woman, would I see the world differently? Would I believe with that crazy

1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:21.040
 person over their beliefs? And the answer is probably yes, because after all, they believe it.

1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:27.520
 And fundamentally, they're the same as you. So then what can you possibly do to fix it?

1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:31.120
 How do you fix Twitter? If you think Twitter needs to be broken or Facebook,

1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:35.280
 if you think Facebook is broken, how do you fix racism? How do you fix any of these things?

1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:44.400
 It's all structural. Individual conversations matter a lot, but you have to create structures

1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:48.320
 that allow people to have those individual conversations all the time in a way that is

1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:53.680
 relatively safe and that allows them to understand that other people have had different experiences,

1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:59.440
 but that ultimately were the same, which sounds very – I don't even know what the right word is.

1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:06.560
 I'm trying to avoid a word like saccharine, but it feels very optimistic. But I think

1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:11.520
 that's okay. I think that's a part of the delusion is you want to be a little optimistic

1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:14.560
 and then recognize that the hard problem is actually setting up the structures in the first

1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:18.880
 place, because it's an almost no one's interest to change the infrastructure.

1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:25.920
 Right. I tend to believe that leaders have a big role to that of selling that optimistic

1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:31.200
 delusion to everybody and that eventually leads to the building of the structures,

1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:38.320
 but that requires a leader that unites everybody on a vision as opposed to divides on a vision,

1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:47.440
 which is this particular moment in history feels like there's a nonzero probability

1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:53.280
 if we go to the P of something akin to a violent or a nonviolent civil war.

1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:59.680
 This is one of the most divisive periods of American history in recent – you can speak to

1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:06.240
 this from perhaps a more knowledgeable and deeper perspective than me, but from my naive

1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:13.040
 perspective, this seems like a very strange time. There's a lot of anger and it has to do with

1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:18.000
 people – I mean, for many reasons. One, the thing that's not spoken about, I think,

1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:28.400
 I think, much is the quiet economic pain of millions that's growing because of COVID,

1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:34.080
 because of closed businesses, because of lost dreams. That's building, whatever that tension

1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:40.480
 is building. The other is there seems to be an elevated level of emotion. I'm not sure if you

1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:46.560
 can psychoanalyze where that's coming from, but this sort of from which the protests and so on

1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:50.160
 percolated. It's like, why now? Why this particular moment in history?

1:57:50.160 --> 1:57:54.560
 Oh, because time – enough time has passed. I mean, the very first race riots were Boston,

1:57:55.760 --> 1:57:58.160
 not to draw anything. Really? When? Oh.

1:57:58.160 --> 1:58:02.640
 This is before – Going way – I mean, like the 1700s or whatever, right? I mean, there was a

1:58:02.640 --> 1:58:06.800
 massive one in New York. I mean, I'm talking way, way, way back when. So, Boston used to be the

1:58:06.800 --> 1:58:11.520
 hotbed of riots. It's just what Boston was all about. So, I'm told from history class.

1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:15.440
 There's an interesting one in New York. I remember when that was.

1:58:15.440 --> 1:58:24.240
 Anyway, the point is, basically, you got to get another generation, old enough to be angry,

1:58:24.240 --> 1:58:28.160
 but not so old to remember what happened the last time, right? Yeah.

1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:33.360
 And that's sort of what happens. But you said two completely – you said two things there that

1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:42.000
 I think are worth unpacking. One has to do with this sort of moment in time and why? Why is this

1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:47.360
 sort of up built? And the other has to do with the kind of – you sort of the economic reality

1:58:47.360 --> 1:58:50.640
 of COVID. So, I'm actually – I want to separate those things, because, for example,

1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:57.280
 this happened before COVID happened, right? So, let's separate these two things for a moment.

1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:05.680
 Now, let me preface all this by saying that although I am interested in history, one of my

1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:09.120
 three minors is an undergrad with history, specifically history of the 1960s.

1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:12.560
 Interesting. The other was Spanish and –

1:59:12.560 --> 1:59:14.800
 Okay, that's a mistake. Oh, I loved that one.

1:59:14.800 --> 1:59:19.920
 Okay. And history of Spanish. And Spanish history, actually. But Spanish and the other was what we

1:59:19.920 --> 1:59:25.120
 would now call cognitive science at the time. Oh, that's fascinating. Interesting.

1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:30.640
 I minored in COGSI here for grad school. That was really – that was really fascinating.

1:59:30.640 --> 1:59:34.240
 It was a very different experience from all the computer science classes I've been taking,

1:59:34.240 --> 1:59:40.960
 even the COGSI classes I was taking at an undergrad. But anyway, I'm not – I am a –

1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:44.160
 I'm interested in history, but I'm hardly historian, right?

1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:44.960
 Yes.

1:59:44.960 --> 1:59:51.760
 So, forgive my – I will ask the audience to forgive my simplification. But

1:59:54.400 --> 1:59:59.200
 I think the question that's always worth asking as opposed to – it's the same question,

1:59:59.200 --> 2:00:08.480
 but a little different. Not why now, but why not before, right? So, why the 1950s,

2:00:08.480 --> 2:00:12.640
 60s civil rights movement as opposed to 1930s, 1940s? Well, first off, there was a civil rights

2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:17.280
 movement in the 30s and 40s. It just wasn't of the same character or quite as well known.

2:00:17.280 --> 2:00:22.160
 Post World War II, lots of interesting things were happening. It's not as if a switch was

2:00:22.160 --> 2:00:27.360
 turned on and Brown versus the Board of Education or the Montgomery bus boycott,

2:00:27.360 --> 2:00:30.320
 and that's when it happened. These things have been building up forever and go all the way back

2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:34.480
 and all the way back and all the way back. And Harriet Tubman was not born in 1950, right?

2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:35.840
 So, we can take these things –

2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:38.800
 It could have easily happened right after World War II.

2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:47.760
 Yes. I think – and again, I am not a scholar – I think that the big difference was TV.

2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:56.400
 These things are visible. People can see them. It's hard to avoid, right? The – why not James

2:00:56.400 --> 2:01:01.760
 Farmer? Why Martin Luther King? Because one was born 20 years after the other or whatever.

2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:08.960
 I think it turns out that – you know, King's biggest failure was in the early days? It was in

2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:17.600
 Georgia. You know, they were doing some – doing the usual thing, trying to integrate. And I forget

2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:24.000
 the guy's name, but you can look this up. But he – a cop, he was a sheriff, made a deal with the

2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:27.920
 whole state of Georgia. We're going to take people and we're going to nonviolently put them in trucks

2:01:28.640 --> 2:01:31.760
 and then we're going to take them and put them in jails very far away from here.

2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:36.800
 And we're going to do that. And we're not going to – there'll be no reason for the press to

2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:43.680
 hang around. And they did that and it worked. And the press left and nothing changed. So,

2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:49.600
 next they went to Birmingham, Alabama and Bullo Connor. And you got to see on TV little boys

2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:55.040
 and girls being hit with fire hoses and being knocked down. And there was outrage and things

2:01:55.040 --> 2:02:00.720
 changed, right? Part of the delusion is pretending that nothing bad is happening that might force

2:02:00.720 --> 2:02:04.480
 you to do something big you don't want to do. But sometimes it gets put in your face and then

2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:10.320
 you kind of can't ignore it. And a large part, in my view, of what happened right was that it

2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:15.440
 was too public to ignore. Now, we created other ways of ignoring it. Lots of change happened in

2:02:15.440 --> 2:02:19.200
 the south. But part of that delusion was that it wasn't going to affect the west or the northeast.

2:02:19.200 --> 2:02:23.040
 And of course, it did. And that caused its own set of problems, which went into the late 60s,

2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:29.920
 into the 70s. And in some ways, we're living with that legacy now and so on. So, why not – what's

2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:35.280
 happening now? Why didn't happen 10 years ago? I think it's – people have more voices. There's

2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:39.360
 not just more TV. There's social media. It's very easy for these things to kind of build on

2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:46.320
 themselves. And things are just quite visible. And there's demographic change. I mean, the world

2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:50.080
 is changing rapidly, right? And so, it's very difficult. You're now seeing people you could

2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:54.960
 have avoided seeing most of your life growing up in a particular time. And it's happening.

2:02:54.960 --> 2:03:00.960
 It's dispersing at a speed that is fast enough to cause concern for some people, but not so fast

2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:07.840
 to cause massive negative reaction. So, that's that. On the other hand – and again, that's a

2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:11.440
 massive oversimplification. But I think there's something there anyway, at least something worth

2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:16.720
 exploring. I'm happy to be yelled at by a real historian. Oh, yeah. I mean, there's just the

2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:21.520
 obvious thing. I mean, I guess you're implying, but not saying this. I mean, it seemed to have

2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:25.920
 percolated the most with just a single video, for example, the George Floyd video.

2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:33.280
 A few difference. It makes it – it's fascinating to think that whatever the mechanisms that put

2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:41.280
 injustice in front of our face, not like – like directly in front of our face, those mechanisms

2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:46.080
 are the mechanisms of change. Yeah. On the other hand, Rodney King. So, no one remembers this. I

2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:50.400
 seem to be the only person who remembers this. But sometime before the Rodney King incident,

2:03:50.400 --> 2:03:55.840
 there was a guy who was a police officer who was saying that things were really bad in Southern

2:03:55.840 --> 2:04:01.760
 California. And he was going to prove it by having some news – some camera people follow

2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:05.520
 him around. And he says, I'm going to go into these towns and just follow me for a week and you

2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:09.920
 will see that I'll get harassed. And like the first night, he goes out there and he crosses

2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:14.800
 into the city. Some cops pull him over and he's a police officer, remember? They don't know that,

2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:19.600
 of course. They like shove his face through a glass window. This was on the news. I distinctly

2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:23.920
 remember watching this as a kid. Actually, I guess I wasn't a kid. I was in college at

2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:27.680
 2000 grad school at the time. So, that's not enough. Like just – just –

2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:30.400
 Well, it disappeared. Like a day like – it didn't go viral.

2:04:31.440 --> 2:04:33.840
 Yeah, whatever that is, whatever that magic thing is.

2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:38.560
 And whatever it was in 92. It was harder to go viral in 92, right? Or 91. Actually,

2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:42.400
 it must have been 90 or 91. But that happened. And like two days later, it's like it never

2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:45.520
 happened. Like nobody – again, nobody remembers this, but I'm like the only person. Sometimes

2:04:45.520 --> 2:04:51.120
 I think I must have dreamed it. Anyway, Rodney King happens. It goes viral or the moral equivalent

2:04:51.120 --> 2:04:57.840
 thereof at the time. And eventually, we get April 29th, right? And I don't know what the

2:04:57.840 --> 2:05:00.800
 difference was between the two things other than one thing caught and one thing didn't.

2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:07.360
 Maybe what's happening now is two things are feeding on one another. One is more people are

2:05:07.360 --> 2:05:12.640
 willing to believe. And the other is there's easier and easier ways to give evidence.

2:05:14.160 --> 2:05:17.440
 Cameras, body cams. But we're still finding ourselves telling the same story. It's the

2:05:17.440 --> 2:05:22.480
 same thing over and over again. I would invite you to go back and read the op eds from what people

2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:28.320
 were saying about the violence is not the right answer after Rodney King. And then go back to 1980

2:05:28.320 --> 2:05:32.800
 and the big riots that were happening around then and read the same op eds. It's the same words,

2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:37.760
 over and over and over again. I mean, there's your remembering history right there. I mean,

2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:40.960
 it's like literally the same words. Like you could have just caught. I'm surprised no one got

2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:46.560
 flagged for plagiarism. It's interesting if you have an opinion on the question of violence

2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:53.120
 and the popular perhaps caricature of Malcolm X versus King Martin Luther King.

2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:57.280
 You know, Malcolm X was older than Martin Luther King. People kind of have it in their head that

2:05:57.280 --> 2:06:05.040
 he's younger. Well, he died sooner. But only by a few years. People think of him as the older

2:06:05.040 --> 2:06:10.320
 statesman and they think of Malcolm X as the young, angry, whatever. But that's more of a

2:06:10.320 --> 2:06:19.600
 narrative device. It's not true at all. I reject the choice as I think it's a false choice. I

2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:24.080
 think they're just things that happen. You just do, as I said, hatred is not, it takes a lot of

2:06:24.080 --> 2:06:29.840
 energy. But you know, every once in a while, you have to fight. One thing I will say without

2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:38.720
 taking a moral position, which I will not take on this matter. Violence has worked.

2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:47.440
 Yeah, that's the annoying thing. It seems like over the top anchor works,

2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:56.000
 outrage works. So you can say being calm and rational and just talking it out is going to

2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:03.760
 lead to progress. But it seems like if you just look through history, being irrationally upset

2:07:04.640 --> 2:07:09.680
 is the way you make progress. Well, it's certainly the way that you get someone to notice you.

2:07:09.680 --> 2:07:13.600
 Yeah. And if they don't notice you, I mean, what's the difference between that and what

2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:17.440
 a... Again, without taking a moral position on this, I'm just trying to observe history here. If you

2:07:18.720 --> 2:07:23.360
 maybe if television didn't exist, the civil rights movement doesn't happen, or it takes longer,

2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:27.760
 or it takes a very different form. Maybe if social media doesn't exist, a whole host of

2:07:27.760 --> 2:07:34.080
 things, positive and negative, don't happen. And what do any of those things do other than

2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:41.840
 expose things to people? Violence is a way of shouting. I mean, many people far more

2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:47.840
 talented and thoughtful than I have said this in one form or another, that violence is the voice

2:07:47.840 --> 2:07:54.560
 of the unheard, right? I mean, it's a thing that people do when they feel as if they have no other

2:07:54.560 --> 2:08:00.320
 option. And sometimes we agree and sometimes we disagree. Sometimes we think they're justified.

2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:07.120
 Sometimes we think they are not. But regardless, it is a way of shouting. And when you shout,

2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:10.160
 people tend to hear you, even if they don't necessarily hear the words that you're saying.

2:08:10.160 --> 2:08:15.760
 They hear that you were shouting. I see no way. So another way of putting it, which I think is

2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:27.760
 less, let us just say provocative, but I think is true, is that all change, particularly change

2:08:27.760 --> 2:08:32.480
 that impacts power, requires struggle. The struggle doesn't have to be violent,

2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:40.000
 you know, but it's a struggle nonetheless. The powerful don't give up power easily.

2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:45.840
 I mean, why should they? But even so, you still, it has to be a struggle. And by the way,

2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:49.600
 this isn't just about, you know, violent, political, whatever, nonviolent political change,

2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:53.680
 right? This is true for understanding calculus, right? I mean, everything requires a struggle.

2:08:53.680 --> 2:08:57.040
 We're back to talking about faculty hiring. At the end of the day, in the end of the day,

2:08:57.040 --> 2:09:02.240
 it all comes down to faculty hiring. That is all a metaphor. Faculty hiring is a metaphor

2:09:02.240 --> 2:09:10.960
 for all of life. Let me ask a strange question. Do you think everything is going to be okay

2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:16.640
 in the next year? Do you have a hope that we're going to be okay?

2:09:16.640 --> 2:09:20.560
 I tend to think that everything's going to be okay, because I just tend to think that everything's

2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:26.240
 going to be okay. My mother says something to me a lot and always has, and I find it quite

2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:32.160
 comforting, which is, this too shall pass. And this too shall pass. Now, this too shall pass is not

2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:38.480
 just this bad thing is going away. Everything passes. I mean, I have a 16 year old daughter

2:09:38.480 --> 2:09:43.920
 who's going to go to college probably at about 15 minutes, given how fast she seems to be growing

2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:48.480
 up. And, you know, I get to hang out with her now. But one day I won't. She'll ignore me just as

2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:52.160
 much as I ignored my parents when I was in college and went to grad school. This too shall pass.

2:09:52.160 --> 2:09:57.200
 But I think that, you know, one day, if we're all lucky, you live long enough to look back on

2:09:57.200 --> 2:10:03.680
 something that happened a while ago, even if it was painful and mostly it's a memory. So yes,

2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:11.440
 I think it'll be okay. What about humans? Do you think we'll live into the 21st century?

2:10:11.440 --> 2:10:17.520
 I certainly hope so. Are you worried that we might destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons,

2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:22.720
 with AGI, with the engineer? I'm not worried about AGI doing it. But I am worried. I mean,

2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:26.640
 at any given moment, right? Also, but you know, at any given moment, a comic. I mean, you know,

2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:31.840
 whatever. I didn't think that outside of things completely beyond our control,

2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:40.240
 we have a better chance than not of making it. You know, I talked to Alex Filipenko from Berkeley.

2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:45.360
 He was talking about comics and then they can come out of nowhere. And that was the realization

2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:52.240
 to me. Wow, we're just watching this darkness and they can just enter and then we have less than a

2:10:52.240 --> 2:11:00.160
 month. And yet you make it from day to day. That one shall not pass. Well, maybe for Earth

2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:07.360
 they'll pass but not for humans. But I'm just choosing to believe that it's going to be okay.

2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:11.600
 And we're not going to get hit by an asteroid, at least not while I'm around. And if we are,

2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:15.360
 well, there's very little I can do about it. So I might as well assume it's not going to happen.

2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:22.800
 It makes food taste better. It makes food taste better. So you, out of the millions of things

2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:28.400
 you've done in your life, you've also began the this week in black history calendar effects.

2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:34.560
 There's, there's like a million questions that can ask here. You said you're not a historian.

2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:44.240
 But is there, let's start at the big history question of, is there somebody in, in history,

2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:51.040
 in black history that you draw a lot of philosophical or personal inspiration from?

2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:54.480
 Or you just find interesting or a moment in history you find interesting?

2:11:55.040 --> 2:12:01.120
 Well, I find the, the entirety of the 40s to the 60s and the civil rights movement that didn't

2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:04.800
 happen and did happen at the same time during then quite inspirational. I mean, I've,

2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:10.480
 I've, I've read quite a bit of the time period, at least I did in my younger days when I had

2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:16.960
 more time to read as many things as I wanted to. What was quirky about this week in black history

2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:23.760
 when I started in the 80s was how focused it was. And it was because of the sources I was

2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:27.920
 stealing from. And I was very much stealing from sort of like a calendar, anything I could find,

2:12:27.920 --> 2:12:31.120
 Google didn't exist, right? And I just pulled as much as I could and just put it together in one

2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:34.560
 place for other people. What ended up being quirky about it, and I started getting people

2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:41.920
 sending me information on it, was the inventors. People who, you know, Garrett Morgan, Benjamin

2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:52.720
 Bannaker, right? People who were inventing things. At a time when how in the world did they manage

2:12:52.720 --> 2:12:57.200
 to invent anything? Like all these other things were happening, mother necessity, right? All these

2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:00.640
 other things were happening. And, you know, there were so many terrible things happening around them.

2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:03.920
 And, you know, they went to the wrong state at the wrong time. I mean, never, never come back.

2:13:03.920 --> 2:13:09.840
 But they were inventing things we use, right? And it was always inspiring to me that people would

2:13:09.840 --> 2:13:16.480
 still create even under those circumstances. I got a lot out of that. I also learned a few lessons.

2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:23.120
 I think, you know, the Charles Richard Jews of the world, you know, you, you, you create things

2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:28.640
 that impact people. You don't necessarily get credit for them. And that's not right. But it's

2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:37.600
 also okay. You're okay with that? Up to a point, yeah. I mean, look, in our world, all we really

2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:44.480
 have is credit. I was always bothered by how much value credit is given. That's the only thing you

2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:48.640
 got. I mean, if you're an academic in some sense, no, it isn't the only thing you've got, but it feels

2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:55.280
 that way sometimes. But you got the actual, we're all going to be dead soon. You got the joy of

2:13:55.280 --> 2:14:02.560
 having created the credit, you know, the credit with Jan. I talked to Jorian Schmidhuber, right?

2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:10.080
 The Turing Award given to three people for deep learning. And you could say that a lot of other

2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:15.440
 people should be on that list. It's the Nobel Prize question. Yeah, it's sad. It's sad. And people

2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:21.200
 like talking about it. But I feel like in the long arc of history, the only person who'll be

2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:27.360
 remembered is Einstein, Hitler, maybe Elon Musk. And the rest of us are just like...

2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:32.160
 Well, you know, someone asked me about immortality once. And I said, and I stole this from somebody

2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:37.840
 else. I don't remember who, but it was, you know, I asked them, what's your great grandfather's name?

2:14:37.840 --> 2:14:44.080
 Any of them? Of course, they don't know. Most of us do not know. I mean, I'm not entirely sure. I know

2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:48.240
 my grandparents, all my grandparents names. I know what I called them. I don't know their middle

2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:54.560
 names, for example. Didn't within living memories, so I could find out. Actually, my grandfather

2:14:54.560 --> 2:15:00.480
 didn't know when he was born. Had no idea how old he was. But I definitely don't know

2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:06.400
 any of my great grandparents are. So in some sense, immortality is doing something preferably

2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:11.920
 positive so that your great grandchildren know who you are. And that's kind of what you can hope

2:15:11.920 --> 2:15:16.720
 for, which is very depressing in some ways. You can... I could turn it into something uplifting

2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:21.520
 if you need me to, but... Yeah, can you do the work here? Yeah, it's simple, right? It doesn't

2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:24.800
 matter. I don't have to know what my great grandfather was to know that I wouldn't be here

2:15:24.800 --> 2:15:29.840
 without him. Yeah. And I don't know who my great grandchildren are, and certainly who my great,

2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:34.320
 great grandchildren are, and I'll probably never meet them, although I would very much like to.

2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:39.520
 But hopefully, I'll set the world in motion in such a way that their lives will be better

2:15:39.520 --> 2:15:42.720
 than they would have been if I hadn't done that. Well, certainly, they wouldn't have existed

2:15:42.720 --> 2:15:47.600
 if I hadn't done the things that I did. So I think that's a good positive thing. You live on

2:15:47.600 --> 2:15:52.720
 through other people. Are you afraid of death? I don't know if I'm afraid of death, but I don't

2:15:52.720 --> 2:16:01.680
 like it. That's another T shirt. I mean, do you ponder it? Do you think about the...

2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:07.280
 The inevitability of oblivion? Yes. I do occasionally. It feels like a very Russian

2:16:07.280 --> 2:16:11.840
 conversation, actually. It's very, yeah. I will tell you a story, a very something that happened

2:16:11.840 --> 2:16:18.480
 to me recently. If you look very carefully, you'll see I have a scar, which, by the way,

2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:21.840
 is an interesting story of its own about why people have half of their thyroid taken out.

2:16:21.840 --> 2:16:28.480
 Some people get scars and some don't. But anyway, I had half my thyroid taken out. The way I got

2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:31.520
 there, by the way, is its own interesting story, but I won't go into it. Just suffice it to say,

2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:34.640
 I did what I keep telling people you should never do, which is never go to the doctor unless you

2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:37.760
 have to, because there's nothing good that's ever going to come out of a doctor's visit, right?

2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:42.080
 So I went to the doctor to look at one thing. It's a little bump I had on the side that I

2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:45.840
 thought might be something bad because my mother made me. And I went there and he's like,

2:16:45.840 --> 2:16:49.520
 oh, it's nothing. But by the way, your thyroid is huge. Can you breathe? Yes, I can breathe.

2:16:49.520 --> 2:16:53.360
 Are you sure? Because it's pushing on your windpipe. You should be dead. Right? So I ended up going

2:16:53.360 --> 2:17:01.360
 there. And to get my... To look at my thyroid, it was growing, what's called a goiter. And he said,

2:17:01.360 --> 2:17:05.280
 we're going to have to take it out at some point. When? Sometime before you're 85 probably,

2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:09.920
 but if you wait till you're 85, that'll be really bad because you don't want to have

2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:14.480
 surgery when you're 85 years old if you can help it. Certainly not the kind of surgery it takes

2:17:14.480 --> 2:17:21.120
 to take out your thyroid. So I went there and we decided, I would decide I would put it off until

2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:27.120
 December 19th because my birthday is December 18th. And I wanted Bill to say I made it to 49

2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:32.640
 or whatever. So I said, I'll wait till after my birthday. In the first six months of that,

2:17:33.520 --> 2:17:40.080
 nothing changed. Apparently in the next three months, it had grown. I had noticed this at all.

2:17:41.440 --> 2:17:45.440
 I went and had surgery. They took out half of it. The other half is still there and working fine,

2:17:45.440 --> 2:17:50.960
 by the way. I don't have to take a pill or anything like that. It's great. I'm in the hospital room

2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:58.080
 and the doctor comes in. I've got these things in my arm. They're going to do whatever. They're

2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:02.480
 talking to me. And the anesthesiologist says, huh, your blood pressure is through the roof.

2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:07.360
 Are you, do you have high blood pressure? I said, no, but I'm terrified if that helps you at all.

2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:11.440
 And the anesthesist, who's the nurse who supports the anesthesiologist,

2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:15.920
 if I got that right, said, oh, don't worry about it. I just put some stuff in your IV.

2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:18.640
 You're going to be feeling pretty good in a couple of minutes. And I remember turning

2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:23.120
 and saying, well, I'm going to feel pretty good in a couple of minutes. Next thing I know, there's

2:18:23.840 --> 2:18:28.560
 this guy and he's moving my bed. And I have this, and he's talking to me and I have this

2:18:28.560 --> 2:18:33.920
 distinct impression that I've met this guy and I should know what he's talking about,

2:18:33.920 --> 2:18:38.880
 but I kind of like just don't remember what just happened. And I look up and I see the

2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:43.840
 tiles going by and I'm like, oh, it's just like in the movies where you see the tiles go by.

2:18:43.840 --> 2:18:49.680
 And then I have this brief thought that I'm in an infinitely long warehouse,

2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:54.960
 and there's someone sitting next to me. And I remember thinking, oh, she's not talking to me.

2:18:54.960 --> 2:19:02.160
 And then I'm back in the hospital bed. And in between the time where the tiles were going by,

2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:06.400
 and I got in the hospital bed, something like five hours had passed. Apparently it had grown

2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:10.640
 so much that it was a four and a half hour procedure instead of an hour long procedure. I lost

2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:15.920
 a neck size and a half. It was pretty big. Apparently it was as big as my heart.

2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:19.600
 Why am I telling you this? I'm telling you this because

2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:21.440
 It's a hell of a story already.

2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:29.520
 So between the tiles going by and me waking up in my hospital bed, no time passed. There was

2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:33.440
 no sensation of time pass. When I go to sleep and I wake up in the morning,

2:19:34.800 --> 2:19:38.800
 I have this feeling that time has passed, this feeling that something has physically changed

2:19:38.800 --> 2:19:45.440
 about me. Nothing happened between the time they put the magic juice in me and the time that I woke

2:19:45.440 --> 2:19:51.040
 up. Nothing. By the way, my wife was there with me talking. Apparently I was also talking. I don't

2:19:51.040 --> 2:19:55.600
 remember any of this, but luckily I didn't say anything I wouldn't normally say. My memory of

2:19:55.600 --> 2:20:01.760
 it is I would talk to her and she would teleport around the room. And then I accused her of witchcraft

2:20:01.760 --> 2:20:06.400
 and that was the end of that. But she, her point of view is I would start talking and then I would

2:20:06.400 --> 2:20:10.320
 fall asleep and then I would wake up and leave off where I was before. I had no notion of any

2:20:10.320 --> 2:20:18.240
 time passing. I kind of imagine that that's death. Is the lack of sensation of time passing.

2:20:18.960 --> 2:20:27.280
 And on the one hand, I am, I don't know, soothed by the idea that I won't notice. On the other

2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:33.840
 hand, I am very unhappy at the idea that I won't notice. So I don't know if I'm afraid of death,

2:20:33.840 --> 2:20:39.680
 but I am completely sure that I don't like it. And that I particularly would prefer to discover

2:20:39.680 --> 2:20:45.200
 on my own whether immortality sucks and be able to make a decision about it. That's what I would

2:20:45.200 --> 2:20:49.760
 prefer. You'd like to have a choice in the matter. I would like to have a choice in the matter.

2:20:49.760 --> 2:20:54.480
 Well, again, on the Russian thing, I think the finiteness of it is the thing that gives it

2:20:55.280 --> 2:20:58.960
 a little flavor, a little spice. Well, in reinforcement learning, we believe

2:20:58.960 --> 2:21:01.440
 that. That's why we have discount factors. Otherwise, it doesn't matter what you do.

2:21:01.440 --> 2:21:09.440
 Amen. Well, let me one last question to sticking on the Russian theme. You

2:21:11.120 --> 2:21:16.400
 talked about your great grandparents, not remembering their name. What do you think is the,

2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:25.920
 in this kind of Markov chain that is life, what do you think is the meaning of it all?

2:21:25.920 --> 2:21:31.280
 What's the meaning of life? Well, in a world where eventually you won't

2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:38.960
 know who your great grandchildren are, I am reminded of something I heard once,

2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:45.120
 or I read once that I really like, which is it is well worth remembering

2:21:45.120 --> 2:21:54.160
 that the entire universe, say for one trifling exception, is composed entirely of others.

2:21:57.040 --> 2:21:58.160
 I think that's the meaning of life.

2:22:01.040 --> 2:22:06.720
 Charles, this is one of the best conversations I've ever had, and I get to see you tomorrow again to

2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:15.600
 hang out with who looks to be one of the most, how should I say, interesting personalities

2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:20.640
 that I'll ever get to meet with Michael Liebman. I can't wait. I'm excited to have had this

2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:26.640
 opportunity. Thank you for traveling all the way here. It was amazing. I always love Georgia Tech.

2:22:26.640 --> 2:22:31.280
 I'm excited to see with you being involved there or with the future holds. Thank you for talking

2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:35.120
 to me. Thank you for having me. I enjoyed every minute of it. Thanks for listening to this

2:23:24.160 --> 2:23:30.880
 There comes a time when people get tired of being pushed out of the glittering sunlight of

2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:39.520
 life's July and left standing amid the piercing chill of an alpine November. Thank you for listening
