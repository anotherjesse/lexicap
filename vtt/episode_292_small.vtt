00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
 we can actually figure out where are the aliens out there in spacetime by being clever about the

00:04.160 --> 00:09.040
 few things we can see, one of which is our current date. And so now that you have this living

00:09.040 --> 00:14.640
 cosmology, we can tell the story that the universe starts out empty. And then at some point, things

00:14.640 --> 00:20.960
 like us appear very primitive. And then some of those stop being quiet and expand. And then for a

00:20.960 --> 00:25.440
 few billion years, they expand, and then they meet each other. And then for the next 100 billion

00:25.440 --> 00:31.120
 years, they commune with each other. That is, the usual models of cosmology say that in roughly

00:32.640 --> 00:37.920
 150 billion years, the expansion of the universe will happen so much that all you'll have left is

00:37.920 --> 00:43.200
 some galaxy clusters and they that are sort of disconnected from each other. But before then,

00:43.200 --> 00:48.160
 they will interact. There will be this community of all the grabby alien civilizations, and each

00:48.160 --> 00:55.040
 one of them will hear about and even meet thousands of others. And we might hope to join them someday.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.400
 And we come part of that community.

00:58.800 --> 01:04.000
 The following is a conversation with Robin Hansen, an economist at George Mason University,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.200
 and one of the most fascinating, wild, fearless, and fun minds I've ever gotten a chance to accompany

01:09.200 --> 01:16.400
 for a time in exploring questions of human nature, human civilization, and alien life out there

01:16.400 --> 01:22.880
 in our impossibly big universe. He is the coauthor of a book titled, The Elephant in the Brain,

01:22.880 --> 01:29.680
 Hidden Motives in Everyday Life, The Age of M, Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth,

01:29.680 --> 01:37.600
 and a fascinating recent paper I recommend on, quote, grabby aliens titled, If Loud Aliens Explain

01:37.600 --> 01:45.120
 Human Earliness, Quiet Aliens Are Also Rare. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. Support it.

01:45.120 --> 01:50.960
 Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Robin Hansen.

01:50.960 --> 01:57.840
 Robin, you are working on a book about, quote, grabby aliens. This is a technical term,

01:57.840 --> 02:01.840
 like the big bang. So what are grabby aliens?

02:01.840 --> 02:08.000
 Robin Hansen Grabby aliens expand fast into the universe and they change stuff.

02:09.200 --> 02:14.880
 That's the key concept. So if they are out there, we would notice that's the key idea.

02:14.880 --> 02:21.840
 So the question is, where are the grabby aliens? So Fermi's question is, where are the aliens?

02:21.840 --> 02:27.200
 And we could vary that in two terms, right? Where are the quiet, hard to see aliens and where are

02:27.200 --> 02:33.920
 the big, loud grabby aliens? So it's actually hard to say where all the quiet ones are, right?

02:34.720 --> 02:38.560
 There could be a lot of them out there because they're not doing much. They're not making a

02:38.560 --> 02:42.960
 big difference in the world. But the grabby aliens, by definition, are the ones you would see.

02:42.960 --> 02:48.960
 We don't know exactly what they do with where they went. But the idea is there in some sort of

02:48.960 --> 02:55.440
 competitive world where each part of them is trying to grab more stuff and do something with it.

02:56.080 --> 03:02.560
 And almost surely whatever is the most competitive thing to do with all the stuff they grab

03:03.200 --> 03:08.480
 isn't to leave it alone the way it started, right? So we humans, when we go around the earth

03:08.480 --> 03:14.080
 and use stuff, we change it. We turn a forest into a farmland, turn a harbor into a city.

03:14.720 --> 03:20.000
 So the idea is aliens would do something with it. And so we're not exactly sure what it would

03:20.000 --> 03:23.360
 look like, but it would look different. So somewhere in the sky, we would see big spheres

03:24.320 --> 03:28.960
 of different activity, whereas things had been changed because they had been there.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.720
 Expanding spheres. Right.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.480
 So as you expand, you aggressively interact and change the environment.

03:34.480 --> 03:40.560
 So the word grabby versus loud, you're using them sometimes synonymously, sometimes not.

03:40.560 --> 03:48.000
 Grabby, to me, is a little bit more aggressive. What does it mean to be loud? What does it mean

03:48.000 --> 03:54.320
 to be grabby? What's the difference? And loud in what ways? A visual? Is it sound? Is it some other

03:54.320 --> 03:59.840
 physical phenomenon like gravitational waves? What are you using this kind of in a broad

03:59.840 --> 04:07.280
 philosophical sense or there's a specific thing that it means to be loud in this universe of ours?

04:07.280 --> 04:11.920
 My coauthors and I put together a paper with a particular mathematical model.

04:12.800 --> 04:18.320
 And so we use the term grabby aliens to describe that more particular model. And the idea is

04:18.320 --> 04:23.600
 it's a more particular model of the general concept of loud. So loud would just be the general idea

04:23.600 --> 04:28.160
 that they would be really obvious. So grabby is the technical term. Is it in the title of the

04:28.160 --> 04:36.000
 paper? It's in the body. The title is actually about loud and quiet. You want to distinguish

04:36.000 --> 04:39.760
 your particular model of things from the general category of things everybody else might talk

04:39.760 --> 04:44.400
 about. So that's how we distinguish. The paper titles, if loud aliens explain human

04:44.400 --> 04:50.400
 eerliness, quiet aliens are also rare. If life on earth, God, this is such a good abstract,

04:50.400 --> 04:57.120
 if life on earth had to achieve and hard steps to reach humanity's level,

04:57.120 --> 05:02.080
 then the chance of this event rose as time to the end of power. So we'll talk about power,

05:02.080 --> 05:08.320
 we'll talk about linear increase. So what is the technical definition of grabby?

05:10.080 --> 05:18.000
 How do you envision grabbiness? And why are in contrast with humans, why aren't humans grabby?

05:18.000 --> 05:22.880
 So where's that line? Is it well definable? What is grabby? What is non grabby?

05:22.880 --> 05:29.920
 We have a mathematical model of the distribution of advanced civilizations, i.e. aliens in space

05:29.920 --> 05:36.400
 and time. That model has three parameters, and we can set each one of those parameters from data,

05:37.280 --> 05:42.080
 and therefore we claim this is actually what we know about where they are in space time.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.160
 So the key idea is they appear at some point in space time,

05:46.160 --> 05:52.720
 and then after some short delay, they start expanding, and they expand at some speed.

05:53.280 --> 05:57.680
 And the speed is one of those parameters. That's one of the three. And the other two parameters

05:57.680 --> 06:03.920
 are about how they appear in time. That is, they appear at random places, and they appear in time

06:03.920 --> 06:08.880
 according to a power law, and that power law has two parameters, and we can fit each of those

06:08.880 --> 06:14.640
 parameters to data. And so then we can say, now we know. We know the distribution of advanced

06:14.640 --> 06:20.560
 civilizations in space and time. So we are right now a new civilization, and we have not yet started

06:20.560 --> 06:25.440
 to expand. But plausibly, we would start to do that within, say, 10 million years of the

06:25.440 --> 06:30.240
 current moment. That's plenty of time. And 10 million years is a really short duration

06:30.240 --> 06:36.720
 in the history of the universe. So we are at the moment a sort of random sample of the kind of

06:36.720 --> 06:41.200
 times at which an advanced civilization might appear, because we may or may not become grabby,

06:41.200 --> 06:45.520
 but if we do, we'll do it soon. And so our current date is a sample, and that gives us

06:45.520 --> 06:50.000
 one of the other parameters. The second parameter is the constant in front of the power law, and

06:50.000 --> 06:58.880
 that's arrived from our current date. So power law, what is the N in the power law?

06:58.880 --> 07:05.120
 That's the complicated thing to explain. Right. Advanced life appeared by going through a sequence

07:05.120 --> 07:11.280
 of hard steps. So starting with very simple life, and here we are at the end of this process at

07:11.280 --> 07:16.640
 a pretty advanced life. And so we had to go through some intermediate steps, such as sexual

07:16.640 --> 07:23.360
 selection, photosynthesis, multicellular animals. And the idea is that each of those steps was hard.

07:24.480 --> 07:29.440
 Evolution just took a long time searching in a big space of possibilities to find each of those

07:29.440 --> 07:35.840
 steps. And the challenge was to achieve all of those steps by a deadline of when the planets

07:36.480 --> 07:42.560
 would no longer host simple life. And so Earth has been really lucky compared to

07:42.560 --> 07:47.120
 all the other billions of planets out there, and that we managed to achieve all these steps

07:47.120 --> 07:53.840
 in the short time of the five billion years that Earth can support simple life.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.600
 So not all steps, but a lot of them, because we don't know how many steps there are before

07:57.600 --> 08:04.560
 you start the expansion. These are all the steps from the birth of life to the initiation of major

08:04.560 --> 08:10.080
 expansion. Right. So we're pretty sure that it would happen really soon so that it couldn't be

08:10.080 --> 08:13.520
 the same sort of a hard step as the last ones in terms of taking a long time. So

08:14.160 --> 08:19.680
 when we look at the history of Earth, we look at the durations of the major things that have happened,

08:19.680 --> 08:26.640
 and that suggests that there's roughly, say, six hard steps that happened, say between three and 12,

08:27.680 --> 08:31.280
 and that we have just achieved the last one that would take a long time.

08:32.240 --> 08:32.640
 Which is?

08:33.920 --> 08:38.400
 Well, we don't know. But whatever it is, we've just achieved the last one.

08:38.400 --> 08:42.320
 Are we talking about humans or aliens here? So let's talk about some of these steps. So

08:42.960 --> 08:48.000
 Earth is really special in some way. We don't exactly know the level of specialness. We don't

08:48.000 --> 08:52.960
 really know which steps were the hardest or not, because we just have a sample of one.

08:52.960 --> 08:56.960
 But you're saying that there's three to 12 steps that we have to go through

08:56.960 --> 09:00.560
 to get to where we are, that are hard steps, hard to find by something that

09:01.280 --> 09:08.320
 took a long time and is unlikely. There's a lot of ways to fail. There's a lot more

09:08.320 --> 09:14.080
 ways to fail than to succeed. The first step would be sort of the very simplest form of life of any

09:14.080 --> 09:21.280
 sort. And then we don't know whether that first sort is the first sort that we see in the historical

09:21.280 --> 09:25.360
 record or not. But then some other steps are, say, the development of photosynthesis,

09:26.080 --> 09:32.000
 the development of sexual reproduction. There's the development of eukaryite cells,

09:32.000 --> 09:36.080
 which are a certain kind of complicated cell that seems to have only appeared once.

09:36.640 --> 09:41.920
 And then there's multicellularity that is multiple cells coming together to large organisms like us.

09:41.920 --> 09:47.920
 And in this statistical model of trying to fit all these steps into a finite window,

09:47.920 --> 09:52.080
 the model actually predicts that these steps could be a varying difficulties. That is,

09:52.080 --> 09:56.960
 they could each take different amounts of time on average. But if you're lucky enough that they

09:56.960 --> 10:01.520
 all appear at a very short time, then the durations between them will be roughly equal.

10:02.400 --> 10:07.200
 And the time remaining left over in the rest of the window will also be the same length.

10:07.200 --> 10:13.360
 So we at the moment have roughly a billion years left on earth until simple life like us would no

10:13.360 --> 10:18.720
 longer be possible. Life appeared roughly 400 million years after the very first time on life

10:18.720 --> 10:23.600
 was possible at the very beginning. So those two numbers right there give you the rough estimate

10:23.600 --> 10:29.920
 of six hard steps. Just to build up an intuition here. So we're trying to create a simple mathematical

10:29.920 --> 10:38.480
 model of how life emerges and expands in the universe. And there's a section in this paper,

10:38.480 --> 10:45.200
 how many hard steps? Question mark. Right. The two most plausibly diagnostic earth durations seem

10:45.200 --> 10:50.640
 to be the one remaining after now before earth becomes uninhabitable for complex life. So you

10:50.640 --> 10:58.880
 estimate how long earth lasts, how many hard steps. There's windows for doing different hard

10:58.880 --> 11:08.880
 steps. And you can sort of like queuing theory mathematically estimate of like the solution

11:08.880 --> 11:14.880
 or the passing of the hard steps or the taking of the hard steps sort of like coldly mathematical

11:14.880 --> 11:24.320
 look. If life pre expansionary life requires a number of steps, what is the probability of taking

11:24.320 --> 11:29.360
 those steps on an earth that lasts a billion years or two billion years or five billion years

11:29.360 --> 11:37.440
 or 10 billion years? And you say solving for E using the observed durations of 1.1 and 0.4

11:37.440 --> 11:46.000
 then gives E values of 3.9 and 12.5 range 5.7 to 26 suggesting a middle estimate of at least six.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.440
 That's where you said six hard steps. Right. Just to get to where we are. Right. We started at the

11:53.440 --> 12:00.320
 bottom. Now we're here. And that took six steps on average. The key point is on average, these things

12:00.320 --> 12:07.680
 on any one random planet would take trillions of years, just a really long time. And so we're

12:07.680 --> 12:13.760
 really lucky that they all happened really fast in a short time before our window closed. And the

12:13.760 --> 12:19.360
 chance of that happening in that short window goes as that time period to the power of the

12:19.360 --> 12:25.360
 number of steps. And so that was where the power we talked about before came from. And so that means

12:25.360 --> 12:30.800
 in the history of the universe, we should overall roughly expect advanced life to appear as a power

12:30.800 --> 12:36.320
 law in time. So that very early on, there was very little chance of anything appearing. And then

12:36.320 --> 12:41.440
 later on, as things appear, other things are appearing somewhat closer to them in time because

12:41.440 --> 12:47.040
 they're all going as this power law. What is the power law? Can we, for people who are not short,

12:47.040 --> 12:54.320
 not inclined, can you describe what a power law is? So say the function x is linear and x squared

12:54.320 --> 13:01.280
 is quadratic. So it's the power of two. If we make x to the three, that's cubic or the power of three.

13:01.280 --> 13:08.560
 And so x to the sixth is the power of six. And so we'd say life appears in the universe

13:08.560 --> 13:15.520
 on a planet like Earth in that proportion to the time that it's been ready for life

13:15.520 --> 13:23.520
 to appear. And that over the universe in general, it'll appear at roughly a power law like that.

13:23.520 --> 13:27.440
 What is the x, what is n? Is it the number of hard steps?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.600
 Yes, the number of hard steps. So that's the idea.

13:29.600 --> 13:34.800
 So it's like, if you're gambling, and you're doubling up every time, this is the probability

13:34.800 --> 13:44.000
 of you just keep winning. So it gets very unlikely very quickly. And so we're the result of this

13:44.000 --> 13:49.760
 unlikely chain of successes. It's actually a lot like cancer. So the dominant model of cancer in

13:49.760 --> 13:54.960
 an organism like each of us is that we have all these cells. And in order to become cancerous,

13:54.960 --> 14:00.160
 a single cell has to go through a number of mutations. And these are very unlikely mutations.

14:00.160 --> 14:04.960
 And so any one cell is very unlikely to have all these mutations happen by the time your

14:04.960 --> 14:10.640
 life spans over. But we have enough cells in our body that the chance of any one cell producing

14:10.640 --> 14:16.320
 cancer by the end of your life is actually pretty high, more like 40%. And so the chance of cancer

14:16.320 --> 14:20.960
 appearing in your lifetime also goes as a power law, this power of the number of mutations that's

14:20.960 --> 14:23.920
 required for anyone's cell in your body to become cancerous.

14:23.920 --> 14:28.320
 The longer you live, the likely you are to have cancer cells.

14:28.320 --> 14:34.160
 And the power is also roughly six. That is, the chance of you getting cancer is the roughly the

14:34.160 --> 14:37.120
 power of six of the time you've been since you were born.

14:37.120 --> 14:45.840
 It is perhaps not lost. And people, you're comparing power laws of the survival or the

14:45.840 --> 14:49.440
 arrival of the human species to cancerous cells.

14:49.440 --> 14:55.200
 The same mathematical model, but of course we might have a different value assumption about

14:55.200 --> 14:57.840
 the two outcomes. But of course, from the point of view of cancer,

14:57.840 --> 15:07.600
 for the point of view of cancer, it's a win win. We'll both get to thrive, I suppose.

15:09.120 --> 15:13.280
 It is interesting to take the point of view of all kinds of lifeforms on earth,

15:13.280 --> 15:16.480
 of viruses, of bacteria. They have a very different view.

15:18.320 --> 15:25.840
 It's like the Instagram channel, Nature is Metal. The ethic under which nature operates doesn't

15:25.840 --> 15:36.880
 often coincide, correlate with human morals. It seems cold and machine like in the selection

15:36.880 --> 15:44.080
 process that it performs. I am an analyst. I'm a scholar, an intellectual. And I feel I should

15:44.080 --> 15:50.720
 carefully distinguish predicting what's likely to happen and then evaluating or judging what I

15:50.720 --> 15:56.160
 think would be better to happen. And it's a little dangerous to mix those up too closely because then

15:56.160 --> 16:02.320
 we can have wishful thinking. And so I try typically to just analyze what seems likely to happen

16:02.320 --> 16:07.680
 regardless of whether I like it or that we do anything about it. And then once you see a rough

16:07.680 --> 16:12.160
 picture of what's likely to happen if we do nothing, then we can ask, well, what might we

16:12.160 --> 16:17.200
 prefer? And ask where could the levers be to move it at least a little toward what we might prefer.

16:17.200 --> 16:22.880
 That's useful. But often doing that just analysis of what's likely to happen if

16:22.880 --> 16:29.680
 we do nothing offends many people. They find that dehumanizing or cold or metal, as you say,

16:30.640 --> 16:36.480
 to just say, well, this is what's likely to happen. And it's not your favorite, sorry, but

16:37.680 --> 16:40.160
 maybe we can do something, but maybe we can't do that much.

16:40.160 --> 16:49.280
 This is very interesting that the cold analysis, whether it's geopolitics, whether it's medicine,

16:50.400 --> 16:57.200
 whether it's economics, sometimes misses some very specific aspect of

16:59.440 --> 17:07.280
 human condition. Like, for example, when you look at a doctor and the act of a doctor helping

17:07.280 --> 17:14.240
 a single patient, if you do the analysis of that doctor's time and cost of the medicine or the

17:14.240 --> 17:20.880
 surgery or the transportation of the patient, this is the Paul Farmer question. Is it worth

17:20.880 --> 17:26.880
 spending 10, 20, $30,000 on this one patient? When you look at all the people that are suffering

17:26.880 --> 17:32.480
 in the world, that money could be spent so much better. And yet, there's something about human

17:32.480 --> 17:39.680
 nature that wants to help the person in front of you. And that is actually the right thing to do,

17:40.480 --> 17:47.440
 despite the analysis. And sometimes when you do the analysis, there's something about the human

17:47.440 --> 17:54.880
 mind that allows you to not take that leap, that irrational leap to act in this way,

17:54.880 --> 18:03.360
 that the analysis explains it away. For example, the US government, the DOT, Department of

18:03.360 --> 18:09.760
 Transportation, puts a value of, I think, like $9 million on a human life. And the moment you

18:09.760 --> 18:14.640
 put that number on a human life, you can start thinking, well, okay, I can start making decisions

18:14.640 --> 18:23.280
 about this or that with a sort of cold economic perspective. And then you might lose, you might

18:23.280 --> 18:30.640
 deviate from a deeper truth of what it means to be human somehow. You have to dance, because then

18:30.640 --> 18:36.880
 if you put too much weight on the anecdotal evidence on these kinds of human emotions,

18:36.880 --> 18:42.880
 then you're going to lose, you could also probably more likely deviate from truth.

18:42.880 --> 18:47.120
 But there's something about that cold analysis. Like, I've been listening to a lot of people

18:47.120 --> 18:55.600
 coldly analyze wars, war in Yemen, war in Syria, Israel, Palestine, war in Ukraine.

18:56.240 --> 19:00.560
 And there's something lost when you do a cold analysis of why something happened.

19:00.560 --> 19:07.520
 When you talk about energy, talking about sort of conflict, competition over resources.

19:07.520 --> 19:14.400
 When you talk about geopolitics, sort of models of geopolitics and why a certain war happened,

19:14.400 --> 19:19.680
 you lose something about the suffering that happens. I don't know. It's an interesting

19:19.680 --> 19:27.280
 thing because you're both, you're exceptionally good at models in all domains, literally.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.640
 But also there's a humanity to you. So it's an interesting dance. I don't know if you can

19:32.640 --> 19:40.800
 comment on that dance. Sure. It's definitely true, as you say, that for many people, if you are accurate

19:40.800 --> 19:46.880
 in your judgment of, say, for a medical patient, what's the chance that this treatment might help?

19:47.600 --> 19:52.240
 And what's the cost? And compare those to each other. And you might say,

19:53.840 --> 20:01.600
 this looks like a lot of cost for a small medical gain. And at that point, knowing that fact that

20:01.600 --> 20:08.720
 might take the wing, the air out of your sails, you might not be willing to do the thing that

20:08.720 --> 20:16.000
 maybe you feel is right anyway, which is still to pay for it. And then somebody knowing that might

20:16.000 --> 20:20.800
 want to keep that news from you, not tell you about the low chance of success or the high cost

20:20.800 --> 20:27.600
 in order to save you this tension, this awkward moment where you might fail to do what they and

20:27.600 --> 20:34.800
 you think is right. But I think the higher calling, the higher standard to hold you to,

20:34.800 --> 20:40.640
 which many people can be held to, is to say, I will look at things accurately, I will know the

20:40.640 --> 20:46.880
 truth, and then I will also do the right thing with it. I will be at peace with my judgment

20:46.880 --> 20:51.920
 about what the right thing is in terms of the truth. I don't need to be lied to in order to

20:51.920 --> 20:56.640
 figure out what the right thing to do is. And I think if you do think you need to be lied to in

20:56.640 --> 21:01.280
 order to figure out what the right thing to do is, you're at a great disadvantage because

21:01.280 --> 21:06.560
 then people will be lying to you, you will be lying to yourself and you won't be as

21:07.200 --> 21:10.800
 effective at achieving whatever good you are trying to achieve.

21:11.360 --> 21:16.800
 But getting the data, getting the facts is step one, not the final step. Absolutely.

21:16.800 --> 21:23.520
 So it's a, I would say having a good model, getting the good data is step one and it's a burden

21:23.520 --> 21:33.520
 because you can't just use that data to arrive at sort of the easy, convenient thing. You have

21:33.520 --> 21:40.080
 to really deeply think about what is the right thing. You can't use the, so the dark aspect of

21:40.080 --> 21:50.160
 data of models is you can use it to excuse away actions that aren't ethical. You can use data

21:50.160 --> 21:56.880
 to basically excuse away anything. But not looking at data, let you explore yourself to pretend and

21:56.880 --> 22:02.960
 think that you're doing good when you're not. Exactly. But it is a burden. It doesn't excuse you

22:02.960 --> 22:09.440
 from still being human and deeply thinking about what is right, that very kind of gray area,

22:09.440 --> 22:16.960
 that very subjective area. That's part of the human condition. But let us return for a time to

22:16.960 --> 22:24.480
 aliens. So you started to define sort of the model, the parameters of grabbiness.

22:25.120 --> 22:29.280
 Right. Or the, as we approach grabbiness. So what happens?

22:29.280 --> 22:33.440
 So again, there was three parameters. Yes. There's the speed at which they expand.

22:34.320 --> 22:40.160
 There's the rate at which they appear in time and that rate has a constant and a power. So we've

22:40.160 --> 22:44.640
 talked about the history of life on earth suggests that power is around six, but maybe three to 12.

22:44.640 --> 22:49.680
 And we can say that constant comes from our current date, sort of sets the overall rate.

22:50.480 --> 22:55.200
 And the speed, which is the last parameter, comes from the fact that when we look in the sky,

22:55.200 --> 22:59.840
 we don't see them. So the model predicts very strongly that if they were expanding slowly,

22:59.840 --> 23:06.560
 say 1% of the speed of light, our sky would be full of vast spheres that were full of activity.

23:06.560 --> 23:12.320
 That is, at a random time when a civilization is first appearing, if it looks out into its sky,

23:12.320 --> 23:16.320
 it would see many other grabby alien civilizations in the sky and they would be much bigger than

23:16.320 --> 23:20.720
 the full moon. There'd be huge spheres in the sky and they would be visibly different. We don't

23:20.720 --> 23:27.520
 see them. Can we pause for a second? Okay. There's a bunch of hard steps that earth had to pass

23:27.520 --> 23:33.040
 to arrive at this place we are currently, which we're starting to launch rockets out into space.

23:33.040 --> 23:38.720
 We're kind of starting to expand. A bit. Right. Very slowly. Okay. But this is like the birth.

23:38.720 --> 23:46.640
 If you look at the entirety of the history of earth, we're now at this precipice of expansion.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.800
 We could. We might not choose to, but if we do, we will do it in the next 10 million years.

23:51.760 --> 23:58.080
 10 million. Wow. Time flies when you're having fun. I was taking more time on the cosmological

23:58.080 --> 24:02.160
 scale. So that is, it might be only a thousand. But the point is, even if it's up to 10 million,

24:02.160 --> 24:05.200
 that hardly makes any difference to the model. So I might as well give you 10 million.

24:05.200 --> 24:10.400
 This makes me feel, I was so stressed about planning what I'm going to do today.

24:10.400 --> 24:16.800
 Right. You got plenty of time. Plenty of time. I just need to be generating some offspring quickly

24:16.800 --> 24:28.000
 here. Okay. So in this moment, this 10 million year gap or window when we start expanding,

24:28.000 --> 24:33.040
 and you're saying, okay, so this is an interesting moment where there's a bunch of other alien

24:33.040 --> 24:38.000
 civilizations that might, at some history of the universe arrived at this moment, were here.

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
 They passed all the hard steps. There's a model for how likely it is that that happens.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.720
 And then they start expanding. And you think of an expansion as almost like a sphere.

24:48.720 --> 24:53.760
 Right. That's when you say speed, we're talking about the speed of the radius growth.

24:53.760 --> 24:58.160
 Exactly. The surface, how fast, the surface. How faithful. Okay. And so you're saying that there

24:58.160 --> 25:04.640
 is some speed for that expansion, average speed, and then we can play with that parameter. And

25:05.280 --> 25:10.720
 if that speed is super slow, then maybe that explains why we haven't seen anything. If it's

25:10.720 --> 25:15.520
 super fast, well, if the slow would create the puzzle, it's low predicts we would see them,

25:15.520 --> 25:19.920
 but we don't see them. Okay. And so the way to explain that is that they're fast. So the idea is,

25:20.560 --> 25:23.600
 if they're moving really fast, then we don't see them till they're almost here.

25:23.600 --> 25:29.520
 Okay. This is counterintuitive. All right. Hold on a second. So I think this works best when I

25:29.520 --> 25:38.080
 say a bunch of dumb things. Okay. And then you elucidate the full complexity and the beauty

25:38.080 --> 25:45.760
 of the dumbness. Okay. So there's these spheres out there in the universe that are made visible

25:45.760 --> 25:50.320
 because they're sort of using a lot of energy. So they're generating a lot of light stuff. They're

25:50.320 --> 25:55.920
 changing things. They're changing things. And change would be visible a long way off.

25:55.920 --> 26:00.480
 Yes. They would take apart stars, rearrange them, restructure galaxies. They would just

26:00.480 --> 26:07.600
 all kinds of big, huge stuff. Okay. If they're expanding slowly, we would see a lot of them

26:08.240 --> 26:13.440
 because the universe is old. Is old enough to where we would see that. We're assuming we're

26:13.440 --> 26:18.320
 just typical, you know, maybe at the 50th percentile of them. So like half of them have appeared so

26:18.320 --> 26:26.800
 far. The other half will still appear later. And the math of our best estimate is that they appear

26:26.800 --> 26:32.320
 roughly once per million galaxies. And we would meet them in roughly a billion years

26:33.120 --> 26:39.280
 if we expanded out to meet them. So we're looking at a grab the aliens model, 3d sim, right?

26:39.840 --> 26:46.560
 What's what's this? That's the actual name of the video. What by the time we get to 13.8 billion

26:46.560 --> 26:55.120
 years, the fun begins. Okay. So this is, this is, we're watching a three dimensional sphere

26:55.120 --> 27:00.240
 rotating. I presume that's the universe and then grab the aliens are expanding and feeling that

27:00.240 --> 27:06.960
 universe exactly with all kinds of fun pretty soon. It's awful. It's full. So that's how

27:07.680 --> 27:13.680
 the grab the aliens come in contact. First of all, with other aliens and then

27:13.680 --> 27:20.240
 with us humans, the following is a simulation of the grab the aliens model of alien civilizations.

27:20.240 --> 27:26.240
 Civilizations are born that expand outwards at constant speed. A spherical region of space is

27:26.240 --> 27:33.840
 shown by the time we get to 13.8 billion years. This sphere will be about 3000 times as wide as

27:33.840 --> 27:40.240
 the distance from the Milky Way to Andromeda. Okay. This is fun. It's huge. Okay. It's huge.

27:40.240 --> 27:49.840
 All right. So why don't we see, we're one little tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny dot in that giant,

27:49.840 --> 27:54.080
 giant sphere. Right. Why don't we see any of the grab the aliens?

27:55.200 --> 28:00.480
 It depends on how fast they expand. So you could see that if they expanded at the speed of light,

28:00.480 --> 28:04.960
 you wouldn't see them until they were here. So like out there, if somebody is destroying the

28:04.960 --> 28:13.280
 universe with a vacuum decay, there's this doomsday scenario where somebody somewhere could change the

28:13.280 --> 28:16.560
 vacuum of the universe and that would expand at the speed of light and basically destroy

28:16.560 --> 28:20.480
 everything it hit. But you'd never see that until it got here because it's expanding at the speed of

28:20.480 --> 28:25.520
 light. If you're spanning really slow, then you see it from a long way off. So the fact we don't

28:25.520 --> 28:30.800
 see anything in the sky tells us they're expanding fast, say over a third the speed of light. And

28:30.800 --> 28:37.040
 that's really, really fast. But that's what you have to believe if you look out and you don't see

28:37.040 --> 28:40.800
 anything. Now you might say, well, maybe I just don't want to believe this whole model. Why should

28:40.800 --> 28:46.320
 I believe this whole model at all? And our best evidence why you should believe this model is our

28:46.320 --> 28:55.120
 early date. We are right now at almost 14 billion years into the universe on a planet around a star

28:55.120 --> 29:02.080
 that's roughly five billion years old. But the average star out there will last roughly five

29:02.080 --> 29:09.520
 trillion years. That is a thousand times longer. And remember that power law, it says that the chance

29:09.520 --> 29:14.960
 of advanced life appearing on a planet goes as the power of sixth of the time. So if a planet

29:14.960 --> 29:20.720
 lasts a thousand times longer, then the chance of it appearing on that planet, if everything would

29:20.720 --> 29:28.400
 stay empty at least, is a thousand to the sixth power or 10 to the 18. So enormous overwhelming

29:28.400 --> 29:32.960
 chance that if the universe would just stay set and empty and waiting for advanced life to appear,

29:32.960 --> 29:40.000
 when it would appear, would be way at the end of all these planet lifetimes. That is the long

29:40.000 --> 29:45.200
 planets near the end of the lifetime, trillions of years into the future. But we're really early

29:45.200 --> 29:49.760
 compared to that. And our explanation is at the moment, as you saw in the video, the universe

29:49.760 --> 29:54.320
 is filling up in roughly a billion years, it'll all be full. And at that point, it's too late for

29:54.320 --> 29:59.280
 advanced life to show up. So you had to show up now before that deadline. Okay, can we break

29:59.280 --> 30:04.480
 that apart a little bit? Okay. Or linger on some of the things you said. So with the power law,

30:04.480 --> 30:11.680
 the things we've done on earth, the model you have says that it's very unlikely. Like we're lucky

30:11.680 --> 30:19.440
 SOBs. Is that is that mathematically correct to say? We're crazy early. That is when early

30:19.440 --> 30:26.080
 means like in the history of the universe in the history. Okay, so given this model,

30:27.200 --> 30:30.560
 how do we make sense of that? If we're super, can we just be the lucky ones?

30:31.600 --> 30:36.480
 Well, 10 to the 18 lucky, you know, how lucky do you feel? So, you know,

30:37.840 --> 30:44.000
 that's pretty lucky, right? You know, 10 to the 18 is a billion billion. So then if you were just

30:44.000 --> 30:49.920
 being honest and humble, that that means, what does that mean? It means one of the assumptions

30:49.920 --> 30:54.640
 that calculated this crazy early must be wrong. Yeah, that's what it means. So the key assumption

30:54.640 --> 31:02.000
 we suggest is that the universe would stay empty. So most life would appear like 1000 times longer

31:02.000 --> 31:08.160
 later than now, if everything would stay empty waiting for it to appear. So what is not empty?

31:08.160 --> 31:11.840
 So the grabby aliens are filling the universe right now, roughly at the moment they filled

31:11.840 --> 31:16.320
 half of the universe, and they've changed it. And when they fill everything, it's too late for

31:16.320 --> 31:23.600
 stuff like us to appear. But wait, hold on a second. Did anyone help us get lucky? If it's so

31:23.600 --> 31:29.920
 difficult, what how do like, so it's like cancer, right? There's all these cells, each of which

31:29.920 --> 31:35.840
 randomly does or doesn't get cancer. And eventually some cell gets cancer. And, you know, we were one

31:35.840 --> 31:44.000
 of those. But hold on a second. Okay. But we got it early. Early compared to the prediction

31:44.000 --> 31:49.360
 with an assumption that's wrong. That's so that's how we do a lot of, you know, theoretical analysis.

31:49.360 --> 31:53.120
 You have a model that makes a prediction that's wrong, then that helps you reject that model.

31:53.120 --> 31:58.080
 Okay, let's try to understand exactly where the wrong is. So the assumption is that the universe

31:58.080 --> 32:05.680
 is empty, stays empty, stays empty, and waits until this advanced life appears in trillions of years.

32:05.680 --> 32:10.160
 That is, if the universe would just stay empty, if there was just, you know, nobody else out there,

32:10.160 --> 32:15.200
 then when you should expect advanced life to appear, if you're the only one in the universe,

32:15.200 --> 32:18.800
 when should you expect to appear? You should expect to appear trillions of years in the future.

32:19.520 --> 32:25.840
 I see. Right. So this is a very sort of nuanced mathematical assumption. I don't think we can

32:25.840 --> 32:34.400
 intuit it cleanly with words. But if you assume that you're just waiting, the universe stays empty

32:34.400 --> 32:42.800
 and you're waiting for one life civilization to pop up, then it's going to, it should happen very

32:42.800 --> 32:49.120
 late, much later than now. And if you look at Earth, the way things happen on Earth,

32:49.120 --> 32:53.440
 it happened much, much, much, much, much earlier than it was supposed to according to this model,

32:53.440 --> 32:57.920
 if you take the initial assumption. Therefore, you can say, well, the initial assumption

32:57.920 --> 33:03.920
 of the universe staying empty is very unlikely. Right. Okay. And the other, the other alternative

33:03.920 --> 33:09.600
 theory is the universe is filling up and will fill up soon. And so we are typical for the origin

33:09.600 --> 33:14.720
 data of things that can appear before the deadline. Before the, okay, it's filling up. So why don't we

33:14.720 --> 33:19.840
 see anything if it's filling up? Because they're expanding really fast. Close to the speed of light.

33:19.840 --> 33:27.120
 Exactly. So we will only see it when it's here. Almost here. Okay. What are the ways in which

33:27.120 --> 33:33.600
 we might see a quickly expanding? This is both exciting and terrifying. It is terrifying. It's

33:33.600 --> 33:40.480
 like watching a truck, like driving at you at a hundred miles an hour. And right. So we would see

33:40.480 --> 33:48.240
 spheres in the sky, at least one sphere in the sky growing very rapidly. And like very rapidly.

33:48.240 --> 33:54.080
 Right? Yes. Very rapidly. So we're not, so there's, there's, you know, different depth,

33:54.080 --> 33:59.120
 because we were just talking about 10 million years. This would be, you might see it 10 million

33:59.120 --> 34:04.080
 years in advance coming. I mean, you still might have a long warning. Or again, the universe is

34:04.080 --> 34:09.600
 14 billion years old. The typical origin times of these things are spread over several billion

34:09.600 --> 34:14.800
 years. So the chance of one originating at a, you know, very close to you in time is very low.

34:14.800 --> 34:20.640
 So they still might take millions of years from the time you see it, from the time it gets here.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.880
 A lot of million years of your years would be terrified of this sphere coming at you.

34:25.440 --> 34:29.200
 But, but, but coming at you very fast. So if they're traveling close to the speed of light,

34:29.200 --> 34:34.000
 but they're coming from a long way away. So remember, the rate at which they appear is one

34:34.000 --> 34:39.040
 per million galaxies. Right. So they're, they're roughly a hundred galaxies away.

34:39.040 --> 34:46.000
 I see. So the delta between the speed of light and their actual travel speed is very important.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.800
 Right. So even if they're going at, say, half the speed of light,

34:49.360 --> 34:54.640
 we'll have a long time then. Yeah. But what if they're traveling exactly at a speed of light?

34:54.640 --> 34:58.560
 Then we see them like, then we wouldn't have much warning, but that's less likely. Well,

34:58.560 --> 35:03.760
 we can't exclude it. And they could also be somehow traveling faster than the speed of light.

35:03.760 --> 35:08.720
 But I think we can exclude because if they could go faster than speed of light, then

35:08.720 --> 35:12.720
 they would just already be everywhere. So in a universe where you can travel

35:12.720 --> 35:16.800
 faster than the speed of light, you can go backwards in space time. So any time you appeared

35:16.800 --> 35:22.160
 anywhere in space time, you could just fill up everything. Yeah. And so anybody in the future,

35:22.160 --> 35:26.400
 whoever appeared, they would have been here by now. Can you exclude the possibility that

35:26.400 --> 35:32.960
 those kinds of aliens aren't already here? Well, you have to have a different discussion of that.

35:32.960 --> 35:36.720
 Right. So let's actually lead that. Let's leave that discussion aside just to

35:36.720 --> 35:42.480
 linger and understand the grabby alien expansion, which is beautiful and fascinating. Okay.

35:44.000 --> 35:50.080
 So there's these giant expanding spheres of alien civilizations. Now,

35:53.680 --> 35:56.800
 when those spheres collide mathematically,

35:56.800 --> 36:07.200
 it's very likely that we're not the first collision of grabby alien civilizations,

36:07.200 --> 36:12.560
 I suppose is one way to say it. So there's like the first time the spheres touch each other,

36:12.560 --> 36:18.720
 recognize each other. Right. They meet. They recognize each other first before they meet.

36:19.840 --> 36:23.600
 They see each other coming. They see each other coming. And then so there's a bunch of them,

36:23.600 --> 36:27.520
 there's a combinatorial thing where they start seeing each other coming. And then there's a

36:27.520 --> 36:31.760
 third neighbor, it's like, what the hell? And then there's a fourth one. Okay. So what does that,

36:31.760 --> 36:38.640
 you think, look like? What lessons from human nature that's the only data we have?

36:39.920 --> 36:44.480
 Well, can you draw? So the story of the history of the universe here is what I would call a

36:44.480 --> 36:50.960
 living cosmology. So what I'm excited about in part by this model is that it lets us tell a story

36:50.960 --> 36:57.760
 of cosmology where there are actors who have agendas. So most ancient peoples, they had cosmologies,

36:57.760 --> 37:01.120
 the stories they told about where the universe came from and where it's going and what's happening

37:01.120 --> 37:04.960
 out there. And their stories, they like to have agents and actors, gods or something out there

37:04.960 --> 37:12.160
 doing things. And lately, our favorite cosmology is dead, kind of boring. We're the only activity

37:12.160 --> 37:17.920
 we know about or see and everything else just looks dead and empty. But this is now telling us,

37:17.920 --> 37:22.640
 no, that's not quite right. At the moment, the universe is filling up. And in a few billion

37:22.640 --> 37:27.840
 years, it'll be all full. And from then on, the history of the universe will be the universe

37:27.840 --> 37:33.680
 full of aliens. Yeah. So that's a, it's a really good reminder, a really good way to think about

37:33.680 --> 37:40.000
 cosmologies. We're surrounded by a vast darkness. And we don't know what's going on in that darkness

37:40.720 --> 37:47.120
 until the light from whatever generate lights arrives here. So we kind of, yeah,

37:47.120 --> 37:51.200
 we look up at the sky, okay, they're stars. Oh, they're pretty. But you don't think about

37:53.120 --> 37:58.960
 the giant expanding spheres of aliens. Right. Because you don't see them. But now we're

37:58.960 --> 38:03.200
 dating. Looking at the clock, if you're clever, the clock tells you. So I like the analogy with

38:03.200 --> 38:08.080
 the ancient Greeks. So you might think that an ancient Greek, you know, staring at the universe

38:08.080 --> 38:13.200
 couldn't possibly tell how far away the sun was or how far away the moon is or how big the earth is

38:13.200 --> 38:17.760
 is that all you can see is just big things in the sky. You can't tell. But they were clever enough,

38:17.760 --> 38:21.920
 actually, to be able to figure out the size of the earth and the distance to the moon and the sun

38:21.920 --> 38:27.200
 and the size of the moon and sun. That is, they could figure those things out, actually, by being

38:27.200 --> 38:30.960
 clever enough. And so similarly, we can actually figure out where are the aliens out there in

38:30.960 --> 38:35.120
 space time by being clever about the few things we can see, one of which is our current date.

38:35.680 --> 38:40.880
 And so now that you have this living cosmology, we can tell the story that the universe starts

38:40.880 --> 38:45.840
 out empty. And then at some point, things like us appear very primitive. And then some of those

38:46.960 --> 38:51.440
 stop being quiet and expand. And then for a few billion years, they expand, and then they meet

38:51.440 --> 38:57.200
 each other. And then for the next 100 billion years, they commune with each other. That is,

38:57.200 --> 39:04.240
 the usual models of cosmology say that in roughly 150 billion years, the expansion of the universe

39:04.240 --> 39:09.760
 will happen so much that all you'll have left is some galaxy clusters that are sort of disconnected

39:09.760 --> 39:17.440
 from each other. But before then, for the next 100 billion years, they will interact.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.760
 There will be this community of all the grabby alien civilizations, and each one of them will

39:21.760 --> 39:28.640
 hear about and even meet thousands of others. And we might hope to join them someday and become

39:28.640 --> 39:32.000
 part of that community. That's an interesting thing to aspire to.

39:32.000 --> 39:39.920
 Yes. Interesting is an interesting word. Is the universe of alien civilizations defined by war

39:40.880 --> 39:52.160
 as much or more than war defined human history? I would say it's defined by competition. And

39:52.160 --> 40:01.200
 then the question is how much competition implies war. So up until recently, competition

40:01.200 --> 40:08.480
 defined life on earth. Competition between species and organisms and among humans,

40:08.480 --> 40:13.520
 competitions among individuals and communities. And that competition often took the form of war

40:13.520 --> 40:21.440
 in the last 10,000 years. Many people now are hoping or even expecting to sort of suppress

40:21.440 --> 40:28.320
 and end competition in human affairs. They regulate business competition, they prevent

40:28.320 --> 40:34.960
 military competition. And that's a future I think a lot of people will like to continue and

40:34.960 --> 40:39.360
 strengthen. People will like to have something close to world government or world governance or

40:39.360 --> 40:44.640
 at least a world community. And they will like to suppress war and many forms of business and

40:44.640 --> 40:51.760
 personal competition over the coming centuries. And they may like that so much that they prevent

40:51.760 --> 40:56.720
 interstellar colonization, which would become the end of that era. That is interstellar colonization

40:56.720 --> 41:03.280
 would just return severe competition to human or our descendant affairs. And many civilizations may

41:03.280 --> 41:08.400
 prefer that and ours may prefer that. But if they choose to allow interstellar colonization,

41:08.960 --> 41:13.680
 they will have chosen to allow competition to return with great force. That is, there's really

41:13.680 --> 41:20.240
 not much of a way to centrally govern a rapidly expanding sphere of civilization. And so I think

41:20.240 --> 41:25.040
 that's one of the most solid things we can predict about grabiolins is they have accepted

41:25.040 --> 41:31.680
 competition. And they have internal competition. And therefore, they have the potential for competition

41:31.680 --> 41:36.160
 when they meet each other at the borders. But whether that's military competition

41:36.160 --> 41:41.680
 is more of an open question. So military meaning physically destructive, right.

41:46.080 --> 41:54.080
 So there's a lot to say there. So one idea that you kind of proposed is progress might be

41:54.080 --> 42:02.240
 maximized through competition, through some kind of healthy competition, some definition of healthy.

42:02.240 --> 42:10.800
 So like constructive, not destructive competition. So like we would likely grabiolins civilizations

42:10.800 --> 42:16.320
 would be likely defined by competition because they can expand faster because they competition

42:16.320 --> 42:21.680
 allows innovation and sort of the battle of ideas. The way I would take the logic is to say,

42:21.680 --> 42:28.720
 you know, competition just happens if you can't coordinate to stop it. And you probably can't

42:28.720 --> 42:35.040
 coordinate to stop it in an expanding interstellar way. So competition is a fundamental force

42:36.640 --> 42:43.200
 in the universe. It has been so far. And it would be within an expanding grabiolins civilization.

42:43.200 --> 42:49.360
 But we today have the chance, many people think and hope, of greatly controlling and limiting

42:49.360 --> 42:54.480
 competition within our civilization for a while. And that's an interesting choice,

42:55.680 --> 43:02.320
 whether to allow competition to re to sort of regain its full force, or whether to suppress

43:02.320 --> 43:12.560
 and manage it. Well, one of the open questions that has been raised in the past less than 100 years

43:12.560 --> 43:20.720
 is whether our desire to lessen the destructive nature of competition or the destructive kind

43:20.720 --> 43:26.720
 of competition will be outpaced by the destructive power of our weapons.

43:28.720 --> 43:38.400
 Sort of if nuclear weapons and weapons of that kind become more destructive than our desire

43:38.400 --> 43:45.040
 for peace, then all it takes is one asshole at the party to ruin the party.

43:45.040 --> 43:51.040
 CB – It takes one asshole to make a delay, but not that much of a delay on the cosmological

43:51.040 --> 43:58.240
 scales we're talking about. So even a vast nuclear war, if it happened here right now on Earth,

43:59.520 --> 44:07.040
 it would not kill all humans. It certainly wouldn't kill all life. And so human civilization

44:07.040 --> 44:13.360
 would return within 100,000 years. CB – So all the history of atrocities,

44:14.240 --> 44:26.400
 and if you look at the Black Plague, which is not human cause atrocities or whatever.

44:26.400 --> 44:29.200
 CB – There are a lot of military atrocities in history.

44:29.200 --> 44:36.720
 CB – Absolutely. CB – In the 20th century. Those challenges to think about human nature, but

44:36.720 --> 44:45.440
 the cosmic scale of time and space, they do not stop the human spirit essentially. The humanity

44:45.440 --> 44:52.480
 goes on. Through all the atrocities, it goes on. Like most likely. So even a nuclear war isn't

44:52.480 --> 45:01.280
 enough to destroy us or to stop our potential from expanding. But we could institute a regime

45:01.280 --> 45:06.160
 of global governance that limited competition, including military and business competition

45:06.160 --> 45:12.160
 of sorts, and that could prevent our expansion. CB – Of course, to play devil's advocate,

45:12.160 --> 45:24.720
 global governance is centralized power, power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

45:25.360 --> 45:33.920
 One of the aspects of competition that's been very productive is not letting any one person,

45:33.920 --> 45:41.120
 any one country, any one center of power become absolutely powerful. Because that's another

45:41.120 --> 45:46.080
 lesson is it seems to corrupt. There's something about ego in the human mind that seems to be

45:46.080 --> 45:53.760
 corrupted by power. So when you say global governance, that terrifies me more than the

45:53.760 --> 45:59.760
 possibility of war. Because it's... CB – I think people will be less terrified

45:59.760 --> 46:04.640
 than you are right now. And let me try to paint the picture from their point of view. This isn't

46:04.640 --> 46:07.840
 my point of view, but I think it's going to be a widely shared point of view.

46:07.840 --> 46:11.200
 CB – Yes. This is two devils advocates arguing, two devils.

46:11.200 --> 46:18.480
 CB – Okay. So for the last half century and into the continuing future, we actually have had

46:19.200 --> 46:26.960
 a strong elite global community that shares a lot of values and beliefs and has created

46:26.960 --> 46:32.320
 a lot of convergence in global policy. So if you look at electromagnetic spectrum or

46:32.320 --> 46:39.840
 medical experiments, or pandemic policy, or nuclear power energy, or regulating airplanes,

46:39.840 --> 46:46.080
 or just in a wide range of area, in fact, the world has very similar regulations and rules

46:46.080 --> 46:51.360
 everywhere. And it's not a coincidence because they are part of a world community where people

46:51.360 --> 46:57.680
 get together at places like Davos, et cetera, where world elites want to be respected by other

46:57.680 --> 47:04.960
 world elites, and they have a convergence of opinion, and that produces something like

47:04.960 --> 47:10.880
 global governance, but without a global center. This is what human mobs or communities have

47:10.880 --> 47:15.920
 done for a long time. That is, humans can coordinate together on shared behavior without a center

47:15.920 --> 47:22.560
 by having gossip and reputation within a community of elites. And that is what we have been doing

47:22.560 --> 47:27.840
 and are likely to do a lot more of. So for example, one of the things that's happening,

47:27.840 --> 47:33.600
 say, with the war in Ukraine is that this world community of elites has decided that they disapprove

47:33.600 --> 47:38.640
 of the Russian invasion, and they are coordinating to pull resources together from all around the

47:38.640 --> 47:46.080
 world in order to oppose it. And they are proud of that, sharing that opinion and their feel that

47:46.080 --> 47:53.920
 they are morally justified in their stance there. And that's this kind of event that actually brings

47:53.920 --> 47:59.440
 world elite communities together, where they come together and they push a particular policy

47:59.440 --> 48:04.160
 and position that they share and that they achieve successes. And the same sort of passion

48:04.160 --> 48:09.120
 animates global elites with respect to, say, global warming or global poverty and other

48:09.120 --> 48:14.800
 sorts of things. And they are, in fact, making progress on those sorts of things through shared

48:14.800 --> 48:22.240
 global community of elites. And in some sense, they are slowly walking toward global governance,

48:22.240 --> 48:28.320
 slowly strengthening various world institutions of governance, but cautiously, carefully watching

48:28.320 --> 48:34.240
 out for the possibility of a single power that might corrupt it. I think a lot of people over

48:34.240 --> 48:36.720
 the coming centuries will look at that history and like it.

48:36.720 --> 48:46.480
 It's an interesting thought. And thank you for playing that devil's advocate there. But I think

48:47.200 --> 48:57.040
 the elites too easily lose touch of the morals that the best of human nature and power corrupts.

48:57.040 --> 49:04.160
 Sure. But their view is the one that determines what happens. Their view may still end up there,

49:04.160 --> 49:09.280
 even if you or I might criticize it from that point of view. So from a perspective of minimizing

49:09.280 --> 49:18.320
 human suffering, elites can use topics of the war in Ukraine and climate change and all of those

49:18.320 --> 49:29.360
 things to sell an idea to the world. And with disregard to the amount of suffering it causes,

49:29.360 --> 49:35.600
 there are actual actions. So like you can tell all kinds of narratives. That's the way propaganda

49:35.600 --> 49:43.120
 works. Hitler really sold the idea that everything Germany is doing is either it's the victim is

49:43.120 --> 49:47.840
 defending itself against the cruelty of the world and it's actually trying to bring out

49:48.560 --> 49:55.360
 about a better world. So every power center thinks they're doing good. And so this is

49:55.360 --> 50:02.960
 this is the positive of competition of not having multiple power centers. This kind of

50:02.960 --> 50:12.400
 gathering of elites makes me very, very, very nervous. The dinners, the meetings in the closed

50:12.400 --> 50:19.920
 rooms. I don't know. I another but remember we talked about separating our cold analysis of

50:19.920 --> 50:24.720
 what's likely or possible from what we prefer. And so that's this isn't exactly enough time for

50:24.720 --> 50:30.800
 that. We might say, I would recommend we don't go this route of a world strong world governance.

50:30.800 --> 50:37.200
 And because I would say it'll preclude this possibility of becoming grabby aliens of filling

50:37.200 --> 50:43.600
 the next nearest million galaxies for the next billion years with vast amounts of activity

50:43.600 --> 50:50.240
 and interest and value of life out there. That's the thing we would lose by deciding that we

50:50.240 --> 50:55.200
 wouldn't expand that we would stay here and keep our comfortable shared governance.

50:55.840 --> 51:07.360
 So you wait, you think that global governance is makes it more likely or less likely that we

51:07.360 --> 51:13.760
 expand out into the universe less. So okay, this is the key. This is the key point. Right. Right.

51:13.760 --> 51:23.280
 So screw the elites. Wait, do we want to expand? So again, I want to separate my neutral analysis

51:23.280 --> 51:29.200
 from my evaluation and say, first of all, I have an analysis that tells us this is a key choice

51:29.200 --> 51:33.760
 that we will face and that it's key choice other aliens have faced out there. And it could be that

51:33.760 --> 51:39.360
 only one in 10 or one in 100 civilizations chooses to expand and the rest of them stay quiet. And

51:39.360 --> 51:46.000
 that's how it goes out there. And we face that choice too. And it'll happen sometime in the next

51:46.000 --> 51:50.960
 10 million years, maybe the next 1000. But the key thing to notice from our point of view is that

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
 even though you might like our global governance, you might like the fact that we've come together.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.080
 We no longer have massive wars and we no longer have destructive competition.

52:01.440 --> 52:06.560
 And that we could continue that. The cost of continuing that would be to prevent

52:06.560 --> 52:10.160
 interstellar colonization. That is, once you allow interstellar colonization,

52:10.160 --> 52:15.200
 then you've lost control of those colonies. And whatever they change into, they could come back

52:15.200 --> 52:21.760
 here and compete with you back here as a result of having lost control. And I think if people value

52:21.760 --> 52:28.000
 that global governance and global community and regulation and all the things it can do enough,

52:28.000 --> 52:31.440
 they would then want to prevent interstellar colonization.

52:31.440 --> 52:37.680
 I want to have a conversation with those people. I believe that both for humanity,

52:37.680 --> 52:43.600
 for the good of humanity, for what I believe is good in humanity and for expansion, exploration,

52:44.880 --> 52:51.280
 innovation, distributing the centers of power is very beneficial. So this whole meeting of elites

52:51.280 --> 52:59.040
 and I've been very fortunate to meet quite a large number of elites. They made me nervous

52:59.040 --> 53:08.240
 because it's easy to lose touch of reality. I'm nervous about that myself,

53:09.040 --> 53:16.800
 to make sure that you never lose touch as you get older, wiser,

53:17.760 --> 53:21.280
 you know, how you generally get like disrespectful of kids, kids these days.

53:21.840 --> 53:26.960
 No, the kids are... Okay, but I think we should hear a stronger case for their position. So I'm

53:26.960 --> 53:34.880
 going to play for the elites. Yes. Well, for the limiting of expansion and for the regulation

53:34.880 --> 53:40.720
 of behavior. Can I link on that? Sure. So you're saying those two are connected.

53:41.600 --> 53:48.640
 So the human civilization and alien civilizations come to a crossroads. They have to decide,

53:48.640 --> 53:55.040
 do we want to expand or not? And connected to that, do we want to give a lot of power to a

53:55.040 --> 54:04.160
 central elite? Do we want to distribute the power centers, which is naturally connected to the

54:04.160 --> 54:11.200
 expansion? When you expand, you distribute the power. If, say over the next thousand years,

54:11.200 --> 54:16.240
 we fill up the solar system, right? We go out from Earth and we colonize Mars and we change a lot of

54:16.240 --> 54:21.600
 things. Within a solar system, still everything is within reach. That is, if there's a rebellious

54:21.600 --> 54:25.680
 colony around Neptune, you can throw rocks at it and smash it and then teach them discipline.

54:27.760 --> 54:31.760
 How did that work for the British Empire? Central control over the solar system is feasible.

54:33.040 --> 54:37.440
 But once you let it escape the solar system, it's no longer feasible. But if you have a solar

54:37.440 --> 54:41.600
 system that doesn't have a central control, maybe broken into a thousand different political units

54:41.600 --> 54:47.200
 in the solar system, then any one part of that that allows interstellar colonization,

54:47.200 --> 54:53.200
 and it happens. That is, interstellar colonization happens when only one party chooses to do it and

54:53.200 --> 54:57.920
 is able to do it. And that's what it is there for. So we can just say in a world of competition,

54:58.640 --> 55:02.640
 if interstellar colonization is possible, it will happen and then competition will continue.

55:02.640 --> 55:06.320
 And that will ensure the continuation of competition into the indefinite future.

55:07.520 --> 55:13.280
 And competition, we don't know, but competition can take violent forms or productive forms.

55:13.280 --> 55:17.520
 And the case I was going to make is that I think one of the things that most scares people about

55:17.520 --> 55:22.720
 competition is not just that it creates Holocausts and death on massive scales,

55:22.720 --> 55:28.480
 is that it's likely to change who we are and what we value.

55:28.480 --> 55:37.120
 Yes. So this is the other thing with power. As we grow, as human civilization grows,

55:37.120 --> 55:43.120
 because multi planetary, multi solar system potentially, how does that change us? Do you think?

55:44.320 --> 55:47.440
 I think the more you think about it, the more you realize it can change us a lot.

55:48.160 --> 55:52.800
 So first of all, it's pretty dark, by the way. Well, it's just honest.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.920
 Right. Well, I was trying to get you there. I think the first thing you should say,

55:55.920 --> 55:59.040
 if you look at history, just human history over the last 10,000 years,

55:59.760 --> 56:04.160
 if you really understood what people were like a long time ago, you'd realize they were really

56:04.160 --> 56:09.520
 quite different. Ancient cultures created people who were really quite different. Most historical

56:09.520 --> 56:14.640
 fiction lies to you about that. It often offers you modern characters in an ancient world.

56:14.640 --> 56:18.640
 But if you actually study history, you will see just how different they were and how

56:18.640 --> 56:24.640
 differently they thought. And they've changed a lot many times and they've changed a lot

56:24.640 --> 56:27.520
 across time. So I think the most obvious prediction about the future is,

56:28.080 --> 56:31.360
 even if you only have the mechanisms of change we've seen in the past,

56:31.360 --> 56:35.920
 you should still expect a lot of change in the future. But we have a lot bigger mechanisms

56:35.920 --> 56:42.480
 for change in the future than we had in the past. So I have this book called The Age of M,

56:42.480 --> 56:46.720
 Work, Love, and Life, and Robots Rule the Earth. And it's about what happens if brain

56:46.720 --> 56:51.520
 emulations become possible. So a brain emulation is where you take an actual human brain and you

56:51.520 --> 56:56.800
 scan it and find spatial and chemical detail to create a computer simulation of that brain.

56:56.800 --> 57:02.720
 And then those computer simulations of brains are basically citizens in a new world. They work

57:02.720 --> 57:07.680
 and they vote and they fall in love and they get mad and they lie to each other. And this is a whole

57:07.680 --> 57:13.120
 new world. And my book is about analyzing how that world is different than our world. Basically

57:13.120 --> 57:17.920
 using competition as my key lever of analysis. That is, if that world remains competitive,

57:17.920 --> 57:21.920
 then I can figure out how they change in that world, what they do differently than we do.

57:21.920 --> 57:29.040
 And it's very different. And it's different in ways that are shocking sometimes to many people

57:29.600 --> 57:33.760
 and ways some people don't like. I think it's an okay world, but I have to admit,

57:33.760 --> 57:41.040
 it's quite different. And that's just one technology. If we add dozens more technologies

57:41.040 --> 57:46.800
 and changes into the future, we should just expect it's possible to become very different than who

57:46.800 --> 57:52.480
 we are. In the space of all possible minds, our minds are a particular architecture, a particular

57:52.480 --> 57:59.040
 structure, a particular set of habits, and they are only one piece in a vast base of possibilities.

57:59.040 --> 58:05.520
 The space of possible minds is really huge. So yeah, let's linger on the space of possible minds

58:05.520 --> 58:16.400
 for a moment, just to sort of humble ourselves how peculiar our peculiarities are. Like the fact that

58:17.200 --> 58:23.280
 we like a particular kind of sex and the fact that we eat food through one hole

58:24.400 --> 58:30.400
 and poop through another hole. And that seems to be a fundamental aspect of life. It's very

58:30.400 --> 58:37.920
 important to us. And that life is finite in a certain kind of way. We have a meat vehicle.

58:38.720 --> 58:44.320
 So death is very important to us. I wonder which aspects are fundamental or would be common

58:45.040 --> 58:52.320
 throughout human history and also throughout history of life on earth and throughout other

58:52.320 --> 58:56.960
 kinds of lives. Like what is really useful? You mentioned competition seems to be one

58:56.960 --> 59:02.720
 fundamental thing. I've tried to do analysis of where our distant descendants might go in terms

59:02.720 --> 59:07.680
 of what are robust features we could predict about our descendants. So again, I have this analysis

59:07.680 --> 59:13.040
 of sort of the next generation, so the next era after ours. If you think of human history as having

59:13.040 --> 59:18.400
 three eras so far, there was the forager era, the farmer era, and the industry era, then my

59:18.400 --> 59:22.640
 attempt in age of M is to analyze the next era after that. And it's very different, but of course

59:22.640 --> 59:28.080
 there could be more and more eras after that. So analyzing a particular scenario and thinking

59:28.080 --> 59:32.720
 it through is one way to try to see how different the future could be, but that doesn't give you

59:32.720 --> 59:39.920
 some sort of sense of what's typical. But I have tried to analyze what's typical. And so I have

59:39.920 --> 59:46.640
 two predictions I think I can make pretty solidly. One thing is that we know at the moment that humans

59:46.640 --> 59:53.120
 discount the future rapidly. So we discount the future in terms of caring about consequences,

59:53.120 --> 59:58.080
 roughly a factor of two per generation. And there's a solid evolutionary analysis why

59:58.080 --> 1:00:03.040
 sexual creatures would do that, because basically your descendants only share half of your genes

1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:07.280
 and your descendants are a generation away. So we only care about our grandchildren.

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:14.880
 Basically, that's a factor of four later because it's later. So this actually explains

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:19.440
 typical interest rates in the economy. That is, interest rates are greatly influenced by our

1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:24.000
 discount rates. And we basically discount the future by a factor of two per generation.

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:32.880
 But that's a side effect of the way our preferences evolved as sexually selected creatures.

1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:38.240
 We should expect that in the longer run, creatures will evolve who don't discount the future.

1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:43.920
 They will care about the long run, and they will therefore not neglect the wrong one. So for example,

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:49.440
 for things like global warming or things like that, at the moment, many commenters are sad that

1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:52.880
 basically ordinary people don't seem to care much, market prices don't seem to care much,

1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:57.360
 and more ordinary people, it doesn't really impact them much because humans don't care much about

1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:04.240
 the long term future. And futurists find it hard to motivate people and to engage people about

1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:08.640
 the long term future because they just don't care that much. But that's a side effect of this

1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:14.640
 particular way that our preferences evolved about the future. And so in the future, they will neglect

1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:19.200
 the future less. And that's an interesting thing that we can predict robustly. Eventually,

1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:25.760
 maybe a few centuries, maybe longer, eventually our descendants will care about the future.

1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:31.600
 Can you speak to the intuition behind that? Is it useful to think more about the future?

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:38.480
 Right. If evolution rewards creatures for having many descendants, then if you have

1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:42.880
 decisions that influence how many descendants you have, then that would be good if you made

1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:46.400
 those decisions. But in order to do that, you'll have to care about them. You'll have to care about

1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:52.160
 that future. So to push back, that's if you're trying to maximize the number of descendants. But

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:57.600
 the nice thing about not caring too much about the long term future is you're more likely to take

1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:04.960
 big risks or you're less risk averse. And it's possible that both evolution and just

1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:13.840
 life in the universe rewards the risk takers. Well, we actually have analysis of the ideal

1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:20.800
 risk preferences too. So there's a literature on ideal preferences that evolutions should promote.

1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:25.920
 And for example, there's a literature on competing investment funds and what the managers of those

1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:30.880
 funds should care about in terms of risk, various kinds of risks, and in terms of discounting.

1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:38.240
 And so managers of investment funds should basically have logarithmic risk, i.e.,

1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:46.000
 in shared risk, in correlated risk, but be very risk neutral with respect to uncorrelated risk.

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:53.440
 So that's a feature that's predicted to happen about individual personal choices in biology

1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:57.280
 and also for investment funds. So that's other things. That's also something we can say about

1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:03.440
 the long run. What's correlated and uncorrelated risk? If there's something that would affect

1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:09.760
 all of your descendants, then if you take that risk, you might have more descendants,

1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:15.840
 but you might have zero. And that's just really bad to have zero descendants. But an uncorrelated

1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:20.240
 risk would be a risk that some of your descendants would suffer, but others wouldn't. And then

1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:26.000
 you have a portfolio of descendants. And so that portfolio ensures you against problems with any

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.640
 one of them. I like the idea of portfolio of descendants. And we'll talk about portfolios with

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:37.200
 your idea of, you briefly mentioned, we'll return there with M. E. M. The age of E. M. Work, love,

1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:43.120
 and life when robots rule the earth. E. M., by the way, is emulated minds. So this one of the

1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:49.280
 M is short for emulations. M is short for emulations. And it's kind of an idea of how we

1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:56.480
 might create artificial minds, artificial copies of minds, or human like intelligences.

1:03:56.480 --> 1:04:00.160
 L. M. I have another dramatic prediction I can make about long term preferences.

1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:00.960
 M. E. M. Yes.

1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:07.280
 L. M. Which is, at the moment, we reproduce as the result of a hodgepodge of preferences that

1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:12.240
 aren't very well integrated, but sort of in our ancestral environment induce us to reproduce.

1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:17.920
 So we have preferences over being sleepy and hungry and thirsty and wanting to have sex and

1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:22.960
 wanting to be excited, excitement, et cetera, right? And so in our ancestral environment,

1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:28.720
 the packages of preferences that we evolved to have did induce us to have more descendants.

1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:34.960
 That's why we're here. But those packages of preferences are not a robust way to

1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:39.520
 provoke having more descendants. They were tied to our ancestral environment, which no

1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:43.520
 longer true. So that's one of the reasons we are now having a big fertility decline,

1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:48.080
 because in our current environment, our ancestral preferences are not inducing us to have a lot

1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:54.400
 of kids, which is from evolution's point of view, a big mistake. We can predict that in the longer

1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:59.920
 run, there will arise creatures who just abstractly know that what they want is more descendants.

1:05:00.800 --> 1:05:05.760
 That's a very robust way to have more descendants is to have that as your direct preference.

1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:14.160
 First of all, your ticket is so clear. I love it. So mathematical and thank you for thinking

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:19.600
 so clear with me and bearing with my interruptions and going on the tangents when we go there.

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:27.200
 So you're just clearly saying that successful long term civilizations will prefer to have

1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:33.360
 descendants, more descendants. Not just prefer consciously and abstractly prefer,

1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:38.640
 that is, it won't be the indirect consequence of other preferences. It will just be the thing they

1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:44.080
 know they want. There'll be a president in the future that says, we must have more sex.

1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:48.000
 We must have more descendants and do whatever it takes to do that. Whatever.

1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:53.600
 We must go to the moon and do the other things. Not because they're easy, but because they're hard,

1:05:53.600 --> 1:05:58.000
 but instead of the moon, let's have lots of sex. Okay. But there's a lot of ways to have descendants,

1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:02.240
 right? Right. But so that's the whole point. When the world gets more complicated and there

1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:06.000
 are many possible strategies, it's having that as your abstract preference that will

1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:10.000
 force you to think through those possibilities and pick the one that's most effective.

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:15.440
 So just to clarify, descendants doesn't necessarily mean the narrow definition of

1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:18.880
 descendants, meaning humans having sex and then having babies. Exactly.

1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:26.480
 You can have artificial intelligence systems that in whom you instill some capability of

1:06:26.480 --> 1:06:31.520
 cognition and perhaps even consciousness. You can also create through genetics and biology,

1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:36.880
 clones of yourself, or slightly modified clones, thousands of them. Right.

1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:43.200
 So all kinds of descendants. It could be descendants in the space of ideas too.

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:47.600
 But somehow we no longer exist in this meat vehicle. It's now just like,

1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:53.600
 whatever the definition of a life form is, you have descendants of those life forms.

1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:58.800
 Yes. And they will be thoughtful about that. They will have thought about what counts as a

1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:02.240
 descendant. And that will be important to them to have the right concept.

1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:06.000
 So the they there is very interesting who the they are.

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:10.160
 But the key thing is we're making predictions that I think are somewhat robust about what

1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:13.920
 our distant descendants will be like. Another thing I think you would automatically accept

1:07:13.920 --> 1:07:17.840
 is they will almost entirely be artificial. And I think that would be the obvious prediction

1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:23.520
 about any aliens we would meet. That is, they would long sense have given up reproducing biologically.

1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:30.000
 Well, it's all it's like organic or something. It's all real and it might be squishy and made

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:34.720
 out of hydrocarbons. But it would be artificial in the sense of made in factories with designs on

1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:39.280
 CAD things, right? Factories with scale economy. So the factories we have made on Earth today

1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:42.720
 have much larger scale economies than the factories in our cells. So the factories in

1:07:42.720 --> 1:07:47.120
 our cells are there are marvels, but they don't achieve very many scale economies. They're tiny

1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:51.280
 little factories. But they're all factories. Yes. Factors on top of factories. So everything,

1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:56.080
 the fact that the factories that are designed is different than sort of the factories that have

1:07:56.080 --> 1:08:02.640
 evolved. I think the nature of the word design is very interesting to uncover there. But let

1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:09.440
 me, in terms of aliens, let me go, let me analyze your Twitter like it's Shakespeare.

1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:16.720
 Okay. There's a tweet says define hello in quotes alien civilizations as one that might

1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:22.240
 in the next million years identify humans as intelligent and civilized travel to Earth and

1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:29.200
 say hello by making their presence and advanced abilities known to us. The next 15 polls, this

1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:35.840
 is a Twitter thread. The next 15 polls ask about such hello aliens. And what these polls ask is

1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:43.520
 your Twitter followers, what they think those aliens will be like certain particular qualities.

1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:49.680
 So poll number one is what percent of hello aliens evolved from biological species with

1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:58.480
 two main genders? And you know, the popular vote is above 80%. So most of them have two genders.

1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:01.600
 What do you think about that? I'll ask you about some of these because it's so interesting. It's

1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:05.280
 such an interesting question. It is a fun set of questions. Yes. I like fun set of questions. So

1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:09.760
 the genders as we look through revolutionary history, what's the usefulness of that as opposed

1:09:09.760 --> 1:09:16.960
 to having just one or like millions? So there's a question in evolution of life on Earth. There are

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:22.400
 very few species that have more than two genders. There are some, but they aren't very many. But

1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:27.680
 there's an enormous number of species that do have two genders, much more than one. And so there's a

1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:34.480
 literature on why did multiple genders evolve? And that's sort of what's the point of having males

1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:42.400
 and females versus hemaphrodites. So most plants are hemaphrodites. That is, they would mate male

1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:49.120
 female, but each plant can be either role. And then most animals have chosen to split into males

1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:54.720
 and females. And then they're differentiating the two genders. And there's an interesting set

1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:59.440
 of questions about why that happens. Because you can do selection. You basically have

1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:06.880
 like one gender competes for the affection of other and their sexual partnership that creates

1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:13.200
 the offspring. So there's sexual selection. It's nice to have, to a party, it's nice to have dance

1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:18.800
 partners. And then each one gets to choose based on certain characteristics. And that's an efficient

1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:23.200
 mechanism for adopting to the environment, being successfully adopted to the environment.

1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:29.760
 It does look like there's an advantage in, if you have males, then the males can take higher

1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:34.240
 variants. And so there can be stronger selection among the males in terms of weeding out genetic

1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:38.240
 mutations because the males have higher variants in their mating success.

1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:45.280
 Sure. Okay. Question number two, what percent of hello aliens evolved from land animals as

1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:55.680
 opposed to plants or ocean slash air organisms? By the way, I did recently see that there's

1:10:55.680 --> 1:11:04.400
 a, only 10% of species on earth are in the ocean. So there's a lot more variety on land.

1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:10.320
 There is. It's interesting. So why is that? I don't even, I can't even intuit exactly why that

1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:16.160
 would be. Maybe survival on land is harder. And so you get a lot. The story that I understand is

1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:23.280
 it's about small niches. So speciation can be promoted by having multiple different species.

1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:29.520
 So in the ocean, species are larger. That is, there are more creatures in each species because the

1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:33.280
 ocean environments don't vary as much. So if you're good in one place, you're good in many other

1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:38.560
 places. But on land, especially in rivers, rivers contain an enormous percentage of the

1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:46.800
 kinds of species on land, you see, because they vary so much from place to place. And so

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:51.040
 a species can be good in one place and then other species can't really compete because

1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:57.200
 they came from a different place where things are different. So it's a remarkable fact actually

1:11:57.200 --> 1:12:02.640
 that speciation promotes evolution in the long run. That is, more evolution has happened on land

1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:07.760
 because there have been more species on land, because each species has been smaller. And

1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:12.480
 that's actually a warning about something called rot that I've thought a lot about, which is one

1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:17.280
 of the problems with even a world government, which is large systems of software today just

1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:22.880
 consistently rot and decay with time and have to be replaced. And that plausibly also is a problem

1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:26.960
 for other large systems, including biological systems, legal systems, regulatory systems.

1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:33.920
 And it seems like large species actually don't evolve as effectively as small ones do.

1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:40.880
 And that's an important thing to notice about. And that's actually different from ordinary

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:48.720
 sort of evolution in economies on earth in the last few centuries, say. On earth,

1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:53.520
 the more technical evolution and economic growth happens in larger integrated cities and nations.

1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:58.720
 But in biology, it's the other way around. More evolution happened in the fragmented species.

1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:04.880
 Yeah. It's such a nuanced discussion, because you can also push back in terms of nations and

1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:11.200
 at least companies. It's like large companies seem to evolve less effectively. There is something

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:20.160
 they have more resources, they don't even have better resilience. When you look at the scale of

1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:24.480
 decades and centuries, it seems like a lot of large companies die.

1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:30.640
 But still large economies do better. Large cities grow better than small cities. Large

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:34.800
 integrated economies like the United States or the European Union do better than small fragmented

1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:43.040
 ones. That's a very interesting long discussion. But so most the people and obviously votes on

1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:50.480
 Twitter represent the absolute objective truth of things. But an interesting question about oceans

1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:54.960
 is that, okay, remember I told you about how most planets would last for trillions of years

1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:59.920
 and then be later, right? So people have tried to explain why life appeared on earth by saying,

1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:04.080
 oh, all those planets are going to be unqualified for life because of various problems. That is,

1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:08.320
 they're around smaller stars which last longer and smaller stars have some things like more

1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:13.920
 solar flares, maybe more tidal locking. But almost all of these problems with longer lived

1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:19.520
 planets aren't problems for ocean worlds. And a large fraction of planets out there are ocean

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:27.840
 worlds. So if life can appear on an ocean world, then that pretty much ensures that these planets

1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:32.400
 that last a very long time could have advanced life because most, no, there's a huge fraction

1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:37.200
 of ocean worlds. So that's actually an open question. So when you say, sorry, when you say

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:45.200
 life appear, you're kind of saying life and intelligent life. So that's an open question

1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:55.120
 is land. And as I suppose the question behind the Twitter poll, which is a grabby alien civilization

1:14:55.120 --> 1:15:01.920
 that comes to say hello, what's the chance that they first began their early steps,

1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:09.600
 the difficult steps they took on land? What do you think? 80%

1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:14.880
 most people on Twitter think is very likely on land. What do you think?

1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:20.480
 I think people are discounting ocean worlds too much. That is, I think people tend to assume that

1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:24.880
 whatever we did must be the only way it's possible. And I think people aren't giving enough credit for

1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:30.400
 other possible paths. But dolphins, water world, by the way, people criticize that movie. I love

1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:36.640
 that movie. Kevin Costner can do me no wrong. Okay, next question. What percent of hello aliens

1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:45.280
 once had a nuclear war with greater than 10 nukes fired in anger? So not in the incompetence

1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:54.240
 and as an accident. Intentional firing of nukes and less than 20% was the most popular vote.

1:15:54.240 --> 1:16:01.120
 That just seems wrong to me. So like, I wonder what, so most people think once you get nukes,

1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:06.480
 we're not going to fire them. They believe in the power of the game. I think they're assuming that

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:10.240
 if you had a nuclear war, then that would just end civilization for good. I think that's the

1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:14.160
 thinking. That's the main thing. And I think that's just wrong. I think you could rise again

1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:18.880
 after a nuclear war. It might take 10,000 years or 100,000 years, but it could rise again.

1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:24.240
 So what do you think about mutually assured destruction as a force to prevent people from

1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:30.800
 firing nuclear weapons? That's a question that's a new to a terrifying degree has been raised now

1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:36.800
 and what's going on. Clearly it has had an effect. The question is just how strong an effect for how

1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:44.240
 long? Clearly we have not gone wild with nuclear war and clearly the devastation that you would get

1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:48.080
 if you initiated nuclear war is part of the reasons people have been reluctant to start a war. The

1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:53.920
 question is just how reliably will that ensure the absence of a war? Yeah, the night is still

1:16:53.920 --> 1:17:02.480
 young. Exactly. It's been 70 years or whatever it's been. But what do you think? Do you think

1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:10.400
 we'll see nuclear war in the century? I don't know in the century, but it's the sort of thing

1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:16.080
 that's likely to happen eventually. There's a very loose statement. Okay, I understand. Now this is

1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:22.160
 where I pull you out of your mathematical model and ask a human question. Do you think this

1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:26.000
 particular question... I think we've been lucky that it hasn't happened so far. But what is the

1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:32.480
 nature of nuclear war? Let's think about this. There's dictators. There's democracies.

1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:43.120
 Miscommunication. How do wars start? World War I, World War II. So the biggest datum here is that

1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:48.240
 we've had an enormous decline in major war over the last century. So that has to be taken into

1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:57.520
 account. War is a process that has a very long tail. That is, there are rare, very large wars.

1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:05.280
 So the average war is much worse than the median war because of this long tail. And that makes it

1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:11.200
 hard to identify trends over time. So the median war has clearly gone way down in the last century

1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:15.760
 that a median rate of war. But it could be that's because the tail has gotten thicker. And in fact,

1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:20.400
 the average war is just as bad. But most wars are going to be big wars. So that's the thing

1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:29.440
 we're not so sure about. There's no strong data on wars with one... Because of the destructive

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:36.480
 nature of the weapons kill hundreds of millions of people. There's no data on this. But we can

1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:40.800
 start intuiting... But we can see that the power law... We can do a power law fit to the rate of

1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:45.840
 wars and it's a power law with a thick tail. So it's one of those things that you should expect,

1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:49.920
 most of the damage to be in the few biggest ones. So that's also true for pandemics and

1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:54.560
 a few other things. For pandemics, most of the damage is in the few biggest ones. So the median

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:57.760
 pandemic so far is less than the average that you should expect in the future.

1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:06.560
 But that fitting of data is very questionable because everything you said is correct. The

1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:14.320
 question is like, what can we infer about the future of civilization threatening pandemics

1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:23.280
 or nuclear war from studying the history of the 20th century? So you can't just fit it to the

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:28.720
 data, the rate of wars and the destructive nature. That's not how nuclear war will happen.

1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:35.120
 Nuclear war happens with two assholes or idiots that have access to a button.

1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:38.480
 Small wars happen that way too. No, I understand that. But that's,

1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:42.800
 it's very important. Small wars aside, it's very important to understand the dynamics,

1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:49.040
 the human dynamics and the geopolitics of the way nuclear war happens in order to predict how we

1:19:49.040 --> 1:19:55.360
 can minimize the chance of... But it is a common and useful intellectual strategy

1:19:55.360 --> 1:20:00.880
 to take something that could be really big or but is often very small and fit the distribution of

1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:04.720
 the data, small things, which you have a lot of them and then ask, do I believe the big things

1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:08.400
 are really that different? Right? I see. So sometimes it's reasonable to say like,

1:20:08.400 --> 1:20:13.760
 save with tornadoes or even pandemics or something. The underlying process might not be

1:20:13.760 --> 1:20:19.920
 that different. But that's a high possible one. It might not be. The fact that mutual

1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:26.080
 assured destruction seems to work to some degree shows you that to some degree it's different

1:20:26.080 --> 1:20:38.320
 than the small wars. So it's a really important question to understand is, are humans capable?

1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:45.600
 One human, like how many humans on earth? If I give them a button now, say you pressing this

1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:50.880
 button will kill everyone on earth. Everyone, right? How many humans will press that button?

1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:57.600
 I want to know those numbers, like day to day, minute to minute. How many people have that much

1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:04.880
 irresponsibility, evil, incompetence, ignorance, whatever word you want to assign. There's a lot

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:10.080
 of dynamics to the psychology that leads you to press that button. But how many? My intuition is

1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:16.480
 the number, the more destructive that press of a button, the fewer humans you find and that

1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:22.720
 number gets very close to zero very quickly, especially people have access to such a button.

1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:28.240
 But that's perhaps a hope than a reality. Unfortunately, we don't have good data on this,

1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:34.400
 which is like, how destructive are humans willing to be?

1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:39.680
 So I think part of this just has to think about, ask you about your time scales you're looking

1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:44.560
 at, right? Right. So if you say, if you look at the history of war, we've had a lot of wars

1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:49.920
 pretty consistently over many centuries. So if I ask, if you ask, will we have a nuclear war in

1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:56.320
 the next 50 years, I might say, well, probably not. If I say 500 or 5000 years, if the same sort

1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:00.880
 of risks are underlying and they just continue, then you have to add that up over time and think

1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:04.400
 the risk is getting a lot larger the longer a timescale we're looking at.

1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:09.920
 But okay, let's generalize nuclear war because what I was more referring to is something that

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:27.520
 kills more than 20% of humans on earth and injures or makes the other 80% suffer horribly,

1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:32.640
 survive but suffer. That's what I was referring to. So when you look at 500 years from now,

1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:36.640
 that might not be nuclear war, that might be something else, right? That's that kind of,

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:45.280
 has that destructive effect. And I don't know, these feel like novel questions in the history

1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:53.120
 of humanity. I just don't know. I think since nuclear weapons, this has been engineering

1:22:53.120 --> 1:23:03.680
 pandemics, for example, robotics, so nanobots. It just seems like a real new possibility that

1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:08.160
 we have to contend with and we don't have good models for my perspective.

1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:13.280
 So if you look on, say, the last 1000 years or 10,000 years, we could say we've seen a certain

1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:16.960
 rate at which people are willing to make big destruction in terms of war.

1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:23.920
 If you're willing to project that data forward, then I think if you want to ask over periods of

1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:28.320
 thousands or tens of thousands of years, you would have a reasonable data set. So the key question

1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:35.280
 is what's changed lately? Yes. Okay. And so a big question of which I've given a lot of thought to,

1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:39.840
 what are the major changes that seem to have happened in culture and human attitudes over

1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:43.520
 the last few centuries and what's our best explanation for those so that we can project

1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:50.240
 them forward into the future? And I have a story about that, which is the story that we have been

1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:56.960
 drifting back toward forager attitudes in the last few centuries as we get rich. So the idea is we

1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:03.120
 spent a million years being a forager and that was a very sort of standard lifestyle that we know

1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:09.680
 a lot about. Foragers sort of live in small bands, they make decisions cooperatively, they share food,

1:24:09.680 --> 1:24:17.200
 they don't have much property, etc. And humans liked that. And then 10,000 years ago, farming

1:24:17.200 --> 1:24:21.920
 became possible, but it was only possible because we were plastic enough to really change our culture.

1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:26.160
 Farming styles and cultures are very different. They have slavery, they have war, they have

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:31.440
 property, they have inequality, they have kings, they stay in one place instead of wandering,

1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:36.960
 they don't have as much diversity of experience or food, they have more disease. This farming life

1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:42.320
 is just very different. But humans were able to sort of introduce conformity and religion and all

1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:45.920
 sorts of things to become just a very different kind of creature as farmers. Farmers are just

1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:51.280
 really different than foragers in terms of their values in their lives. But the pressures that made

1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:57.200
 foragers into farmers were part mediated by poverty. Farmers were poor and if they deviated

1:24:57.200 --> 1:25:01.520
 from the farming norms that people around them supported, they were quite at risk of starving

1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:08.800
 to death. And then in the last few centuries, we've gotten rich. And as we've gotten rich,

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:15.040
 the social pressures that turned foragers into farmers have become less persuasive to us.

1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:19.600
 So for example, a farming young woman who was told, if you have a child out of wedlock,

1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:25.200
 you and your child may starve, that was a credible threat. She would see actual examples around her

1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:30.320
 to make that believable threat. Today, if you say to a young woman, you shouldn't have a child out

1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:34.720
 of wedlock, she will see other young women around her doing okay that way. We're all rich enough

1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:40.000
 to be able to afford that sort of a thing. And therefore, she's more inclined often to go with

1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:44.800
 her inclinations or sort of more natural inclinations about such things rather than to be

1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:49.920
 pressured to follow the official farming norms of that you shouldn't do that sort of thing. And

1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:55.520
 all through our lives, we have been drifting back toward forager attitudes because we've been getting

1:25:55.520 --> 1:26:02.080
 rich. And so aside from at work, which is an exception, but elsewhere, I think this explains

1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:08.080
 trends toward less slavery, more democracy, less religion, less fertility, more promiscuity,

1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:15.680
 more travel, more art, more leisure, fewer work hours, all of these trends are basically explained

1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:21.680
 by becoming more forager like. And much science fiction celebrates this. Star Trek or the culture

1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:26.640
 novels, people like this image that we are moving toward this world where basically like foragers

1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:31.200
 were peaceful, we share, we make decisions collectively, we have a lot of free time,

1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:42.240
 we are into art. So forger is a word and it has, it's a loaded word because it's connected to

1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:49.280
 the actual, what life was actually like at that time. As you mentioned, we sometimes don't do a

1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:55.200
 good job of telling accurately what life was like back then. But you're saying if it's not exactly

1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:02.400
 like foragers, it rhymes in some fundamental way. You also said peaceful. Is it obvious that a forager

1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:10.400
 with a nuclear weapon would be peaceful? I don't know if that's 100% obvious. So we know, again,

1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:15.760
 we know fair bit about what foragers lives were like. The main sort of violence they had would be

1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:20.400
 sexual jealousy. They were relatively promiscuous. And so there'd be a lot of jealousy. But they did

1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:25.280
 not have organized wars with each other. That is, they were at peace with their neighboring forager

1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:29.440
 bands. They didn't have property in land or even in people. They didn't really have marriage.

1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:37.920
 And so they were in fact peaceful. When you think about large scale wars, they don't start

1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:41.600
 large scale wars. They didn't have coordinated large scale wars in the ways chimpanzees do.

1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:46.080
 Our chimpanzees do have wars between one tribe of chimpanzees and others, but human foragers

1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:51.600
 do not. Farmers return to that, of course, the more chimpanzee like styles. Well, that's a hopeful

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:59.840
 message. If we could return real quick to the Hello Aliens Twitter thread, one of them is really

1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:05.280
 interesting about language. What percent of Hello Aliens would be able to talk to us in our language?

1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:10.080
 This is the question of communication. It actually gets to the nature of language.

1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:19.040
 It also gets to the nature of how advanced you expect them to be. So I think some people see

1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:25.200
 that we have advanced over the last thousands of years, and we aren't reaching any sort of limit.

1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:30.880
 And so they tend to assume it could go on forever. And I actually tend to think that within, say,

1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:36.400
 10 million years, we will sort of max out on technology. We will sort of learn everything

1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:42.720
 that's feasible to know for the most part. And then obstacles to understanding would more be

1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:47.600
 about cultural differences, like ways in which different places had just chosen to do things

1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:55.680
 differently. And so then the question is, is it even possible to communicate across some cultural

1:28:55.680 --> 1:29:01.520
 differences? And I might think, I could imagine some maybe advanced aliens who've become so weird

1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:05.040
 and different from each other, they can't communicate with each other. But we're probably

1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:11.440
 pretty simple compared to them. So I would think, sure, if they wanted to, they could communicate

1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:19.200
 with us. So it's the simplicity of the recipient. I tend to just to push back. Let's explore the

1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:29.680
 possibility where that's not the case. Can we communicate with ants? I find that this idea

1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:35.440
 that we're not very good at communicating in general. Oh, you're saying, all right, I see.

1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:39.200
 You're saying once you get orders of magnitude better at communicating.

1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:43.600
 Once they had maxed out on all, you know, communication technology in general, and they

1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:48.000
 just understood in general how to communicate with lots of things, and had done that for millions

1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:52.400
 of years. But you have to be able to, this is so interesting, as somebody who cares a lot about

1:29:52.400 --> 1:30:00.640
 empathy and imagining how other people feel. It's communication requires empathy, meaning

1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:08.160
 you have to truly understand how the other person, the other organism sees the world.

1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:14.640
 It's like a four dimensional species talking to two dimensional species. It's not as trivial as,

1:30:15.200 --> 1:30:20.880
 to me at least, as it might have foreseen. So let me reverse my position a little,

1:30:20.880 --> 1:30:28.240
 because I'll say, well, the whole Hello Aliens question really combines two different scenarios

1:30:28.240 --> 1:30:34.560
 that we're slipping over. So one scenario would be that the Hello Aliens would be like Grebi

1:30:34.560 --> 1:30:38.480
 Aliens. They would be just fully advanced. They would have been expanding for millions of years.

1:30:38.480 --> 1:30:42.960
 They would have a very advanced civilization. And then they would finally be arriving here,

1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:46.640
 you know, after a billion years perhaps of expanding, in which case they're going to be

1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:53.200
 crazy advanced at some and maximal level. But the Hello Aliens about aliens we might meet soon,

1:30:54.000 --> 1:31:00.160
 which might be sort of UFO aliens, and UFO aliens probably are not Grebi aliens.

1:31:01.440 --> 1:31:06.320
 How do you get here if you're not a Grebi alien? Well, they would have to be able to travel.

1:31:07.440 --> 1:31:14.160
 Oh, but they would not be expansive. So if it's a road trip, it doesn't count as

1:31:14.160 --> 1:31:18.480
 Grebi. So we're talking about expanding the colony, the comfortable colony.

1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:26.480
 The question is, if UFOs, some of them are aliens, what kind of aliens would they be?

1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:30.560
 This is sort of the key question you have to ask in order to try to interpret that scenario.

1:31:32.240 --> 1:31:38.960
 The key fact we would know is that they are here right now, but the universe around us is not full

1:31:38.960 --> 1:31:46.960
 of an alien civilization. So that says right off the bat that they chose not to allow

1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:53.920
 massive expansion of a Grebi civilization. Is it possible that they chose it, but we just don't

1:31:53.920 --> 1:32:00.320
 see them yet? These are the stragglers, the journeymen. So the timing coincidence is,

1:32:00.320 --> 1:32:05.280
 it's almost surely if they are here now, they are much older than us. They are many millions of

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:11.360
 years older than us. And so they could have filled the galaxy in that last millions of years if they

1:32:11.360 --> 1:32:17.280
 had wanted to. That is, they couldn't just be right at the edge. They're very unlikely. Most

1:32:17.280 --> 1:32:21.120
 likely they would have been around waiting for us for a long time. They could have come here any

1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:25.520
 time in the last millions of years, and they've been waiting around for this, or they just chose

1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:31.200
 to come recently. But the timing coincidence would be crazy unlikely that they just happened to be

1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:36.560
 able to get here, say in the last 100 years. They would no doubt have been able to get here

1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:41.440
 far earlier than that. Again, we don't know. So this is a fringe like UFO sightings on Earth.

1:32:41.440 --> 1:32:46.480
 We don't know if this kind of increase in sightings have anything to do with actual visitation.

1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:50.720
 I'm just talking about the timing. They arose at some point in space time.

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:57.600
 And it's very unlikely that that was just at a point that they could just barely get here recently.

1:32:57.600 --> 1:33:03.680
 Almost surely they could have been here much earlier. And throughout the stretch of several

1:33:03.680 --> 1:33:08.240
 billion years that Earth existed, they could have been here often. Exactly. So they could have

1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:12.640
 therefore filled the galaxy a long time ago if they had wanted to. Let's push back on that.

1:33:13.760 --> 1:33:21.120
 The question to me is, isn't it possible that the expansion of a civilization is much harder than the

1:33:21.120 --> 1:33:33.360
 travel? The sphere of the reachable is different than the sphere of the colonized. So isn't it

1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:39.440
 possible that the sphere of places where the stragglers go, the different people that journey

1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:47.120
 out, the explorers, is much, much larger and grows much faster than the civilization? So in which

1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:52.880
 case they would visit us. There's a lot of visitors, the grad students of the civilization.

1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:58.560
 They're exploring, they're collecting the data, but we're not yet going to see them.

1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:06.560
 And by yet, I mean across millions of years. The time delay between when the first thing

1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:13.760
 might arrive and then when colonists could arrive in mass and do a mass amount of work is cosmologically

1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:18.560
 short. In human history, of course, sure, there might be a century between that,

1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:23.040
 but a century is just a tiny amount of time on the scales we're talking about.

1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:28.880
 So this is in computer science and colony optimization. It's true for ants. So it's like

1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:34.400
 when the first ant shows up, it's likely, and if there's anything of value, it's likely the other

1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:40.480
 ants will follow quickly. Yeah. Relatively short. It's also true that traveling over very long

1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:46.240
 distances, probably one of the main ways to make that feasible is that you land somewhere,

1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:50.480
 you colonize a bit, you create new resources that can then allow you to go farther.

1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:53.200
 Many short hops as opposed to a giant long journey.

1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:58.240
 Exactly. Those hops require that you are able to start a colonization of sorts

1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:02.640
 along those hops, right? You have to be able to stop somewhere, make it into a waystation

1:35:02.640 --> 1:35:05.520
 such that you can then support your moving farther.

1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:11.280
 So what do you think of, there's been a lot of UFO sightings. What do you think about

1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:20.400
 those UFO sightings? And what do you think if any of them are of extraterrestrial origin

1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:26.240
 and we don't see giant civilizations out in the sky, how do you make sense of that then?

1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:31.200
 I want to do some clearing of throats, which people like to do on this topic.

1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:35.280
 Right? They want to make sure you understand they're saying this and not that.

1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:41.440
 Right? So I would say the analysis needs both a prior and a likelihood.

1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:48.880
 So the prior is what are the scenarios that are all plausible in terms of what we know about the

1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:54.880
 universe? And then the likelihood is the particular actual sightings, like how hard are those to

1:35:54.880 --> 1:36:01.200
 explain through various means? I will establish myself as somewhat of an expert on the prior. I

1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:06.080
 would say my studies and the things I've studied make me an expert and I should stand up and have

1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:11.760
 an opinion on that and be able to explain it. The likelihood, however, is not my area of expertise.

1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:18.000
 That is, I'm not a pilot. I don't do atmospheric studies of things I haven't studied in detail,

1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:22.080
 the various kinds of atmospheric phenomena or whatever that might be used to explain the

1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:27.600
 particular sightings. I can just say from my amateur stance, the sightings look damn puzzling.

1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:33.760
 They do not look easy to dismiss. The attempts I've seen to easily dismiss them seem to me to

1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:39.840
 fail. It seems like these are pretty puzzling weird stuff that deserve an expert's attention.

1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:44.560
 So in terms of considering asking what the likelihood is. So an analogy I would make

1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:50.960
 is a murder trial. On average, if we say what's the chance any one person murdered another person

1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:55.120
 as a prior probability, maybe one in a thousand people get murdered, maybe each person has a

1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:58.960
 thousand people around them who could plausibly have done it. So the prior probability of a murder

1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:04.800
 is one in a million. But we allow murder trials because often evidence is sufficient to overcome

1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:11.440
 on one in a million prior because the evidence is often strong enough, right? My guess, rough guess

1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:16.560
 for the UFOs as aliens scenario, some of them is the priors roughly one in a thousand,

1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:23.920
 much higher than the usual murder trial, plenty high enough that strong physical evidence could

1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:28.720
 put you over the top to think it's more likely than not. But I'm not an expert on that physical

1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:33.440
 evidence. I'm going to leave that part to someone else. I'm going to say the priors pretty high.

1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:38.000
 This isn't a crazy scenario. So then I can elaborate on where my prior comes from.

1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:44.160
 What scenario could make most sense of this data? My scenario to make sense has

1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:52.000
 two main parts. First is panspermia siblings. So panspermia is the

1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:56.080
 hypothesized process by which life might have arrived on Earth from elsewhere.

1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:01.760
 And a plausible time for that. I mean, it would have to happen very early in Earth history because

1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:06.640
 we see life early in history. And a plausible time could have been during the stellar nursery

1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:13.360
 where the sun was born with many other stars in the same close proximity with lots of rocks

1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:21.520
 flying around able to move things from one place to another. Rock with life on it from some

1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:27.120
 rock with planet with life came into that stellar nursery. It plausibly could have seeded many

1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:31.040
 planets in that stellar nursery all at the same time. They're all born at the same time in the

1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:36.960
 same place pretty close to each other. Lots of rocks flying around. So a panspermia scenario

1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:44.560
 would then create siblings, i.e., there would be, say, a few thousand other planets out there.

1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:49.920
 So after the nursery forms, it drifts, it separates. They drift apart. And so out there in the galaxy,

1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:53.760
 there would now be a bunch of other stars all formed at the same time. And we can actually spot

1:38:53.760 --> 1:39:00.080
 them in terms of their spectrum. And they would have then started on the same path of life as we

1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:07.200
 did with that life being seeded. But they would move at different rates. And most likely, most of

1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:14.000
 them would never reach an advanced level before the deadline. But maybe one other did. And maybe it

1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:20.080
 did before us. So if they did, they could know all of this and they could go searching for their

1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:24.320
 siblings. That is, they could look in the sky for the other stars with the spectrum that

1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:29.680
 matches the spectrum that came from this nursery. They could identify their sibling stars in the

1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:34.160
 galaxy, the thousand of them. And those would be of special interest to them because they would

1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:39.360
 think, well, life might be on those. And they could go looking for them.

1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:48.960
 We just such a brilliant mathematical, philosophical, physical, biological idea

1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:56.400
 of panspermia siblings, because we all kind of started a similar time in this local pocket

1:39:56.400 --> 1:40:02.640
 of the universe. And so that changes a lot of the math.

1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:06.080
 So that would create this correlation between when advanced life might appear,

1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:10.800
 no longer just random independent spaces in space time. There'd be this cluster, perhaps.

1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:14.960
 And that allows interaction between elements of the cluster. Yes.

1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:22.240
 Non grabby alien civilizations, kind of primitive alien civilizations like us

1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:26.240
 with others. And they might be a little bit ahead. That's so fascinating.

1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:33.600
 Well, they would probably be a lot ahead. So the puzzle is, if they happen before us,

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:36.400
 they probably happen hundreds of millions of years before us.

1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:38.080
 But less than a billion.

1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:43.680
 Less than a billion, but still plenty of time that they could have become grabby and filled

1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:49.520
 the galaxy and gone beyond. So the fact is they chose not to become grabby. That would have to

1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:54.160
 be the interpretation. If we have panspermia. So plenty of time to become grabby, you said.

1:40:54.160 --> 1:40:56.640
 So yes, they should be. And they chose not to.

1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:01.840
 Are we sure about this? So again, 100 million years is enough.

1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:07.280
 100 million. So I told you before that I said within 10 million years, our descendants will

1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:10.880
 become grabby or not. And they'll have that choice. Okay.

1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:16.240
 And so they clearly more than 10 million years earlier than us. So they chose not to.

1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:20.400
 But still go on vacation, look around. So just not grabby.

1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:25.280
 If they chose not to expand, that's going to have to be a rule they set to not allow any

1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:31.600
 part of themselves to do it. Like if they let any little ship fly away with the ability to

1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:38.000
 create a colony, the game's over, then the universe becomes grabby from their origin

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:42.560
 with this one colony. So in order to prevent their civilization being grabby, they have to

1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:46.960
 have a rule they enforce pretty strongly that no part of them can ever try to do that.

1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:52.800
 Through a global authoritarian regime or through something that's internal to that,

1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:59.120
 meaning it's part of the nature of life that it doesn't want as like a political officer in

1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:06.480
 the brain or whatever. Yes, there's something in human nature that prevents you from want or

1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:13.360
 like alien nature that as you get more advanced, you become lazier and lazier in terms of exploration

1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:19.680
 and expansion. So I would say they would have to have enforced a rule against expanding. And that

1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:26.080
 rule would probably make them reluctant to let people leave very far. Anyone vacation tripped

1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:30.080
 far away could risk an expansion from this vacation trip. So they would probably have a

1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:36.720
 pretty tight lid on just allowing any travel out from their origin in order to enforce this rule.

1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:41.120
 But then we also know, well, they would have chosen to come here. So clearly,

1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:46.880
 they made an exception from their general rule to say, okay, but an expedition to Earth,

1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:53.200
 that should be allowed. It could be intentional exception or incompetent exception. But if

1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:58.160
 incompetent, then they couldn't maintain this over 100 million years, this policy of not allowing

1:42:58.160 --> 1:43:02.400
 any expansion. So we have to see, they have successfully, they're not just had a policy to

1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:09.120
 try, they succeeded over 100 million years in preventing the expansion. That's substantial

1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:14.160
 competence. Let me think about this. So you don't think there could be a barrier in 100 million

1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:24.240
 years, you don't think there could be a barrier to like technological barrier to becoming expansionary.

1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:30.320
 Imagine the Europeans that tried to prevent anybody from leaving Europe to go to the New

1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:35.360
 World. And imagine what it would have taken to make that happen over 100 million years.

1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:41.840
 Yeah, it's impossible. They would have to have very strict guards at the borders.

1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:43.920
 I just don't know. They're saying, no, you can't go.

1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:48.320
 But just to clarify, you're not suggesting that's actually possible.

1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:55.280
 I am suggesting it's possible. I don't know how you keep my silly human brain.

1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:00.800
 Maybe it's a brain that values freedom, but I don't know how you can keep no matter how much force,

1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:08.240
 no matter how much censorship or control or so on. I just don't know how you can keep people from

1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:13.360
 exploring into the mysterious into the end. You're thinking of people, we're talking aliens.

1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:17.040
 So remember, there's a vast space of different possible social creatures they could have evolved

1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:22.160
 from, different cultures they could be in, different kinds of threats. I mean, there are many things

1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:26.560
 that you talked about that most of us would feel very reluctant to do. This isn't one of those.

1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:34.240
 Okay, so how if the UFO sightings represent alien visitors, how the heck are they getting here under

1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:40.160
 the Panspermia siblings? So Panspermia siblings is one part of the scenario, which is that's

1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:44.400
 where they came from. And from that, we can conclude they had this rule against expansion,

1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:50.080
 and they've successfully enforced that. That also creates a plausible agenda for why they would be

1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:56.000
 here, that is to enforce that rule in us. That is, if we go out and expanding, then we have defeated

1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:03.600
 the purpose of this rule they set up. So they would be here to convince us to not expand.

1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:08.480
 Convince in quotes. Right, through various mechanisms. So obviously, one thing we conclude

1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:13.120
 is they didn't just destroy us. That would have been completely possible. So the fact that they're

1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:18.880
 here and we are not destroyed means that they chose not to destroy us. They have some degree of

1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:24.720
 empathy or whatever their morals are that would make them reluctant to just destroy us. They would

1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:31.120
 rather persuade us. They're destroying their brethren. And so there's a difference in arrival

1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:37.120
 and observation. They may have been observing for a very long time. Exactly. And they arrive to try

1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:48.240
 to not to try. I don't think to ensure that we don't become grabby, which is because we can see

1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:52.080
 that they did not. They must have enforced a rule against that. And they are therefore

1:45:53.040 --> 1:45:57.120
 here to do that's a plausible interpretation why they would risk this expedition when they

1:45:57.120 --> 1:46:01.280
 clearly don't risk very many expeditions over this long period to allow this one exception.

1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:05.840
 Because otherwise, if they don't, we may become grabby. And they could have just destroyed us,

1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:10.800
 but they didn't. And they're closely monitoring the technological advancing of our civilization,

1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:15.440
 like what nuclear weapons is one thing that, all right, cool. That might have less to do with

1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:20.080
 nuclear weapons and more with nuclear energy. Maybe they're monitoring fusion closely.

1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:26.320
 Like, how clever are these apes getting? So no doubt they have a button that if we get

1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:31.760
 too uppity or risky, they can push the button and ensure that we don't expand. But they'd rather do

1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:36.640
 it some other way. So now, that explains why they're here and why they aren't out there.

1:46:36.640 --> 1:46:39.680
 There's another thing that we need to explain. There's another key data we need to explain

1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:43.840
 about UFOs if we're going to have a hypothesis that explains them. And this is something many

1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:49.840
 people have noticed, which is they had two extreme options they could have chosen and

1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:54.640
 didn't chose. They could have either just remained completely invisible, clearly an advanced

1:46:54.640 --> 1:46:58.320
 civilization could have been completely invisible. There's no reason they need to fly around and

1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:03.120
 be noticed. They could just be in orbit in dark satellites that are completely invisible to us

1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:07.120
 watching whatever they want to watch. That would be well within their abilities. That's one thing

1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:11.600
 they could have done. The other thing they could do is just show up and land on the White House lawn,

1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:16.000
 as they say, and shake hands and make themselves really obvious. They could have done either of

1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.800
 those and they didn't do either of those. That's the next thing you need to explain about UFOs

1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:25.360
 as aliens. Why would they take this intermediate approach of hanging out near the edge of visibility

1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:29.600
 with somewhat impressive mechanisms, but not walking up and introducing themselves,

1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:35.120
 nor just being completely invisible? Okay. A lot of questions there. So one,

1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:40.480
 do you think it's obvious where the White House lawn is? Well, it's obvious where there are

1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:44.080
 concentrations of humans that you could go up and introduce. But is humans the most interesting

1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:51.360
 thing about Earth? Yeah. Are you sure about this? Because if they're worried about an expansion,

1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:54.880
 then they would be worried about a civilization that could be capable of expansion. Obviously,

1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:59.600
 humans are the civilization on Earth. That's by far the closest to being able to expand.

1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:11.360
 I just don't know if aliens obviously see humans, like the individual humans,

1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:19.520
 like the organ of the meat vehicles as the center of focus for observing a life on a planet.

1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:23.600
 They're supposed to be really smart in advance. This shouldn't be that hard for that.

1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:28.080
 But I think we're actually the dumb ones because we think humans are the important things,

1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:32.720
 but it could be our ideas. It could be something about our technologies.

1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:34.560
 But that's mediated with us. It's correlated with us.

1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:43.760
 No, we make it seem like it's mediated by us humans. But the focus for alien civilizations might be

1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:48.560
 the AI systems or the technologies themselves. That might be the organism.

1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:57.360
 Okay. Human is the food, the source of the organism that's under observation.

1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:03.360
 But what they wanted to have close contact with was something that was closely near humans,

1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:08.000
 then they would be contacting those. And we would just incidentally see, but we would still see.

1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:15.040
 But isn't it possible, taking their perspective, isn't it possible that they would want to interact

1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:20.160
 with some fundamental aspect that they're interested in without interfering with it?

1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:25.280
 And that's actually a very, no matter how advanced you are, it's very difficult to do.

1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:35.520
 But that's puzzling. The prototypical UFO observation is a shiny, big object in the sky

1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:45.600
 that has very rapid acceleration and no apparent surfaces for using air to manipulate at speed.

1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:53.280
 The question is why that? Again, for example, if they just wanted to talk to our computer

1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:59.760
 systems, they could move some sort of a little probe that connects to a wire and reads and

1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:02.640
 sends bits there. They don't need a shiny thing flying in the sky.

1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:08.880
 But I don't think they would be, they are, would be looking for the right way to communicate,

1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:14.160
 the right language to communicate. Everything you just said, looking at the computer systems,

1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:21.440
 I mean, that's not a trivial thing. Coming up with a signal that us humans would not freak out too

1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:25.600
 much about, but also understand, might not be that trivial. How would you talk to things?

1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:29.360
 Well, so not freak out a part is another interesting constraint. So again, I said,

1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:32.960
 like the two obvious strategies are just to remain completely invisible and watch,

1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:38.160
 which would be quite feasible or to just directly interact. That's come out and be really very

1:50:38.160 --> 1:50:42.240
 direct, right? I mean, there's big things that you can see around. There's big cities,

1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:46.480
 there's aircraft carriers, there's lots of, if you wanted to just find a big thing and come

1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:50.240
 right up to it and like tap it on the shoulder or whatever, that would be quite feasible,

1:50:50.240 --> 1:50:58.320
 then they're not doing that. So my hypothesis is that one of the other questions there was,

1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:03.120
 do they have a status hierarchy? And I think most animals on earth, who are social animals,

1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:07.840
 have status hierarchy. And they would reasonably presume that we have a status hierarchy.

1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:16.000
 And take me to your leader. Well, I would say their strategy is to be impressive and sort of

1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:23.520
 get us to see them at the top of our status hierarchy. Just to, that's how, for example,

1:51:23.520 --> 1:51:29.280
 we domesticate dogs, right? We convince dogs we're the leader of their pack, right? And we

1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:34.000
 domesticate many animals that way. But as we just swap in to the top of their status hierarchy,

1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:38.720
 and we say, we're your top status animal, so you should do what we say, you should follow our lead.

1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:47.440
 So the idea that would be, they are going to get us to do what they want by being top status.

1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:52.800
 You know, all through history, kings and emperors, etc, have tried to impress their citizens and

1:51:52.800 --> 1:51:57.200
 other people by having the bigger palace, the bigger parade, the bigger crown, and diamonds,

1:51:57.200 --> 1:52:02.320
 right, whatever, maybe building a bigger pyramid, etc. Just, it's a very well established trend,

1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:05.760
 to just be high status by being more impressive than the rest.

1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:11.520
 To push back, when there's an order of several orders of magnitude of power differential,

1:52:11.520 --> 1:52:16.560
 asymmetry of power, I feel like that status hierarchy no longer applies. It's like memetic

1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:21.280
 theory. It's like, most emperors are several orders of magnitude more powerful than anyone,

1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:27.840
 a member of their empire. Let's increase that by even more. So like, if I'm interacting with ants,

1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:34.880
 I no longer feel like I need to establish my power with ants. I actually want to

1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:42.240
 lessen, I want to lower myself to the ants. I want to become the lowest possible ant,

1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:47.200
 so that they would welcome me. So I'm less concerned about them worshiping me. I'm more

1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:51.840
 concerned about them welcoming me. Well, it is important that you be non threatening and that

1:52:51.840 --> 1:52:55.600
 you be local. So I think, for example, if the aliens had done something really big in the sky,

1:52:55.600 --> 1:53:01.200
 you know, 100 light years away, that would be there, not here. And that could seem threatening.

1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:05.760
 So I think their strategy to be the high status would have to be to be visible, but to be here

1:53:05.760 --> 1:53:10.240
 and non threatening. I just don't know if it's obvious how to do that. Like, take your own

1:53:10.240 --> 1:53:18.240
 perspective, you see a planet with with relatively intelligent, like complex structures being formed,

1:53:18.240 --> 1:53:24.240
 like, yeah, life forms, we could see this under in Titan, or something like that, the moon,

1:53:24.240 --> 1:53:30.880
 you know, right, Europa, you start to see not just primitive bacterial life, but multicellular

1:53:30.880 --> 1:53:37.760
 life. And it seems to form some very complicated cellular colonies, structures that they're

1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:43.520
 dynamic, there's a lot of stuff going on, some some giant, gigantic cellular automata type of

1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:53.600
 construct. How do you make yourself known to them in an impressive fashion without destroying it?

1:53:54.400 --> 1:54:00.480
 Like, we know how to destroy potentially, right? So if you go touch stuff, you're likely to hurt

1:54:00.480 --> 1:54:04.160
 it, right? There's a good risk of hurting something by touch, getting too close and touching it and

1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:10.080
 interacting, right? Yeah, like landing on a White House lawn. Right. So the claim is that

1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:14.720
 their current strategy of hanging out at the periphery of our vision and just being very

1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:20.800
 clearly physically impressive with very clear physically impressive abilities is at least

1:54:20.800 --> 1:54:26.080
 a plausible strategy they might use to impress us and convince us sort of we're at the top of their

1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:31.760
 status hierarchy. And I would say if they if they came closer, not only would they risk hurting us

1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:36.400
 in ways that they couldn't really understand, but more plausibly, they would reveal things about

1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:41.600
 themselves we would hate. So if you look at how we treat other civilizations on earth and other

1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:47.600
 people, we are generally, you know, interested in foreigners and people from other plant lands.

1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:52.480
 And we were generally interested in their varying cult customs, etc. Until we find out that they

1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:58.080
 do something that violates our moral norms. And then we hate them. And these are aliens for God's

1:54:58.080 --> 1:55:02.400
 Sakes, right? They there's just going to be something about them that we hate. They eat babies,

1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:07.440
 who knows what it is, but something they don't think is offensive, but that they think we might

1:55:07.440 --> 1:55:11.760
 find. And so they would be they would be risking a lot by revealing a lot about themselves. We

1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:18.160
 would find something we hated. Interesting. But do you resonate at all with mimetic theory where

1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:22.880
 like, we only feel this way about things that are very close to us. So aliens are sufficiently

1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:27.680
 different to where we'll be like, fascinated, terrified or fascinated, but not like.

1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:31.360
 Right. But if they want to be at the top of our status hierarchy to get us to follow them,

1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:36.160
 they can't be too distant. They have to be close enough that we would see them that way.

1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:42.400
 Pretend to be close enough, right. And not reveal much that mystery that old Clint Eastwood cowboy

1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:47.760
 say less. We're clever enough that we can figure out their agenda. That is just from the fact

1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:51.520
 that we're here. If we see that they're here, we can figure out, oh, they want us not to expand.

1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:56.160
 And look, they are this huge power and they're very impressive. So and a lot of us don't want to

1:55:56.160 --> 1:56:02.240
 expand. So that could easily tip us over the edge toward we already wanted to not expand. We already

1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:07.440
 wanted to be able to regulate and have a central community. And here are these very advanced smart

1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:12.720
 aliens who have survived for a hundred million years. And they're telling us not to expand either.

1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:21.360
 This is brilliant. I love this so much. The, the, so returning to Penn's spermia siblings,

1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:31.120
 just to clarify one thing. In that framework, how would, who originated, who planted it?

1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:35.760
 Would it be a grabby alien civilization that planted the siblings? Or no.

1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:41.840
 The simple scenario is that life started on some other planet billions of years ago.

1:56:41.840 --> 1:56:46.480
 Yes. And it went through part of the stages of evolution to advance life, but not all the way

1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:52.080
 to advanced life. And then some rock hit it, grabbed a piece of it on the rock and that rock

1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:57.920
 drifted for maybe in a million years until it happened upon the stellar nursery where it then

1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:03.760
 seeded many stars. And something about that life, without being super advanced, it was nevertheless

1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:08.720
 resilient to the harsh conditions of space. There's some graphs that I've been impressed by

1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:14.160
 that show sort of the level of genetic information in various kinds of life on the history of Earth.

1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:19.680
 And basically, we are now more complex than the earlier life, but the earlier life was

1:57:19.680 --> 1:57:24.640
 still pretty damn complex. And so if you actually project this log graph in history,

1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:29.520
 it looks like it was many billions of years ago when you get down to zero. So plausible,

1:57:29.520 --> 1:57:32.720
 you could say there was just a lot of evolution that had to happen before you

1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:36.400
 to get to the simplest life we've ever seen in history of life on Earth was still pretty damn

1:57:36.400 --> 1:57:42.880
 complicated. And so that's always been this puzzle. How could life get to this enormously

1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:50.160
 complicated level in the short period it seems to at the beginning of Earth history? So it's only

1:57:50.160 --> 1:57:55.920
 300 million years at most when it appeared, and then it was really complicated at that point.

1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:01.040
 So Panspermi allows you to explain that complexity by saying, well, it's been another

1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:05.360
 five billion years on another planet going through lots of earlier stages where it was

1:58:05.360 --> 1:58:08.720
 working its way up to the level of complexity you see at the beginning of Earth.

1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:15.280
 Well, we'll try to talk about other ideas of the origin of life. But let me return to UFO

1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:20.480
 sightings. Is there other explanations that are possible outside of Panspermi as siblings

1:58:20.480 --> 1:58:27.040
 that can explain no grabby aliens in the sky and yet alien arrival on Earth?

1:58:28.640 --> 1:58:33.680
 Well, the other categories of explanations that most people will use is, well, first of all,

1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:39.760
 just mistakes like you're confusing something ordinary for something mysterious, right?

1:58:40.640 --> 1:58:46.400
 Or some sort of secret organization like our government is secretly messing with us and trying

1:58:46.400 --> 1:58:51.920
 to do a false flag ops or whatever. They're trying to convince the Russians or the Chinese

1:58:51.920 --> 1:58:55.440
 that there might be aliens and scare them into not attacking or something, right?

1:58:56.480 --> 1:59:01.520
 Because the history of World War II say the US government did all these big fake operations

1:59:01.520 --> 1:59:06.880
 where they were faking a lot of big things in order to mess with people. So that's a possibility.

1:59:06.880 --> 1:59:12.880
 The government's been lying and faking things and paying people to lie about what they saw,

1:59:12.880 --> 1:59:19.440
 etc. That's a plausible set of explanations for the range of sightings seen. And another

1:59:19.440 --> 1:59:24.240
 explanation people offer is some other hidden organization on Earth. There's some secret

1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:28.000
 organizations somewhere that has much more advanced capabilities than anybody's given

1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:33.920
 a credit for. For some reason, it's been keeping secret. I mean, they all sound somewhat implausible,

1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:38.160
 but again, we're looking for maybe one in a thousand sort of priors. The question is,

1:59:39.600 --> 1:59:46.320
 could they be in that level of plausibility? Can we just link on this? First of all, you've written,

1:59:47.360 --> 1:59:54.400
 talked about, thought about so many different topics. You're an incredible mind. And I just

1:59:54.400 --> 2:00:00.160
 thank you for sitting down today. I'm almost like at a loss of which place we explore. But let me,

2:00:00.160 --> 2:00:06.640
 on this topic, ask about conspiracy theories. Because you've written about institutions and

2:00:06.640 --> 2:00:19.280
 authorities. What, this is a bit of a therapy session, but what do we make of conspiracy theories?

2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:27.040
 The phrase itself is pushing you in a direction. So clearly, in history, we've had many large

2:00:27.040 --> 2:00:32.000
 coordinated keepings of secrets, say the Manhattan Project. And there was hundreds of thousands of

2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:37.840
 people working on that over many years, but they kept it a secret. Clearly, many large military

2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:45.280
 operations have kept things secrets over even decades with many thousands of people involved.

2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:52.640
 So clearly, it's possible to keep some things secret over time periods. But the more people

2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:58.880
 you involve and the more time you are assuming and the less centralized an organization or the

2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:02.880
 less discipline they have, the harder it gets to believe. But we're just trying to calibrate,

2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:07.600
 basically, in our minds, which kind of secrets can be kept by which groups over what time periods

2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:15.680
 for what purposes, right? But let me, I don't have enough data. So I'm somebody, I hang out with

2:01:15.680 --> 2:01:22.880
 people and I love people. I love all things really. And I just, I think that most people,

2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:27.760
 even the assholes, have the capacity to be good and they're beautiful and I enjoy them.

2:01:28.400 --> 2:01:33.280
 So the kind of data my brain, whatever the chemistry of my brain is that sees the beautiful

2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:42.560
 things is maybe collecting a subset of data that doesn't allow me to intuit the competence that

2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:50.720
 humans are able to achieve in constructing conspiracy theories. So for example, one thing

2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:55.120
 that people often talk about is like intelligence agencies, this like broad thing they say,

2:01:55.120 --> 2:02:01.360
 the CIA, the FSB, the different, the British intelligence, I've fortunate or unfortunate

2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:07.200
 enough, never gotten a chance that I know of to talk to any member of those intelligence agencies,

2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:15.280
 nor like take a peek behind the curtain or the first curtain, I don't know how many levels

2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:21.040
 of curtains there are. And so I don't, I can't intuit my interactions with government. I was

2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:28.160
 funded by DOD and DARPA and I've interacted, been to the Pentagon, like with all due respect

2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:33.920
 to my friends, lovely friends in government and there are a lot of incredible people,

2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:40.880
 but there is a very giant bureaucracy that sometimes suffocates the ingenuity of the human

2:02:40.880 --> 2:02:47.520
 spirit is one way I can put it, meaning they are, I just, it's difficult for me to imagine

2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:53.280
 extreme competence at a scale of hundreds or thousands of human beings. Now that doesn't

2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:59.280
 mean that's my very anecdotal data of the situation. And so I try to build up my intuition

2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:09.040
 about centralized system of government, how much conspiracy is possible, how much the

2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:16.560
 intelligence agencies or some other source can generate sufficiently robust propaganda that

2:03:16.560 --> 2:03:23.040
 controls the populace. If you look at World War II, as you mentioned, there have been extremely

2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:30.160
 powerful propaganda machines on the side of Nazi Germany, on the side of the Soviet Union,

2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:36.800
 on the side of the United States and all these different mechanisms. Sometimes they control

2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:44.480
 the free press through social pressures. Sometimes they control the press through the threat of

2:03:44.480 --> 2:03:50.160
 violence as you do in authoritarian regimes. Sometimes it's like deliberately the dictator

2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:59.040
 like writing the news, the headlines and literally announcing it. And something about human psychology

2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:07.520
 forces you to embrace the narrative and believe the narrative and at scale that becomes reality

2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:13.760
 when the initial spark was just a propaganda thought in a single individual's mind. So I don't,

2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:23.280
 I can't necessarily intuit of what's possible, but I'm skeptical of the power of human institutions

2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:30.720
 to construct conspiracy theories that cause suffering at scale, especially in this modern age

2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:34.800
 when information is becoming more and more accessible by the populace. Anyway, that's,

2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:40.560
 I don't know if you can elucidate, cause suffering at scale. But of course, say during war time,

2:04:40.560 --> 2:04:45.200
 the people who are managing the various conspiracies like D Day or Manhattan Project,

2:04:45.200 --> 2:04:51.520
 they thought that their conspiracy was avoiding harm rather than causing harm. So if you can get

2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:58.080
 a lot of people to think that supporting the conspiracy is helpful, then a lot more might do

2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:03.840
 that. And there's just a lot of things that people just don't want to see. So if you can make your

2:05:03.840 --> 2:05:07.680
 conspiracy the sort of thing that people wouldn't want to talk about anyway, even if they knew about

2:05:07.680 --> 2:05:13.600
 it, you're, you know, most of the way there. So I have learned many over the years, many things

2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:18.080
 that most ordinary people should be interested in, but somehow don't know even though the data's

2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:22.000
 been very widespread. So, you know, I have this book, The Elephant in the Brain, and one of the

2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:28.240
 chapters is there on medicine. And basically, most people seem ignorant of the very basic fact that

2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:32.960
 when we do randomized trials where we give some people more medicine than others, the people

2:05:32.960 --> 2:05:38.800
 who get more medicine are not healthier. Just overall in general, just like induce somebody

2:05:38.800 --> 2:05:43.680
 to get more medicine because you just give them more budget to buy medicine, say, not a specific

2:05:43.680 --> 2:05:48.160
 medicine, just the whole category. And you would think that would be something most people should

2:05:48.160 --> 2:05:52.640
 know about medicine. You might even think that would be a conspiracy theory to think that would

2:05:52.640 --> 2:05:59.200
 be hidden. But in fact, most people never learn that fact. So just to clarify, just a general

2:05:59.200 --> 2:06:03.200
 high level statement, the more medicine you take, the less healthy you are.

2:06:04.480 --> 2:06:09.440
 Randomized experiments don't find that fact. Do not find that more medicine makes you more

2:06:09.440 --> 2:06:14.960
 healthy. They're just no connection. Oh, in randomized experiments, there's no relationship

2:06:14.960 --> 2:06:19.680
 between more medicine. So it's not a negative relationship, but it's just no relationship.

2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:27.120
 Right. And so the conspiracy theories would say that the businesses that sell you medicine don't

2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:32.800
 want you to know that fact. And then you're saying that there's also part of this is that people just

2:06:32.800 --> 2:06:37.040
 don't want to know. They just don't want to know. And so they don't learn this. So, you know,

2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:41.600
 I've lived in the Washington area for several decades now reading the Washington Post regularly.

2:06:41.600 --> 2:06:47.040
 Every week there was a special, you know, section on health and medicine. It never was mentioned

2:06:47.040 --> 2:06:51.920
 in that section of the paper in all the 20 years I read that. So do you think there is some truth

2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:58.000
 to this caricatured blue pill, red pill, where most people don't want to know the truth?

2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:01.760
 Not most people. There are many things about which people don't want to know certain kinds of

2:07:01.760 --> 2:07:07.840
 truths that is bad looking truths, truths that discouraging, truths that sort of take away

2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:13.680
 the justification for things they feel passionate about. Do you think that's a bad aspect of human

2:07:13.680 --> 2:07:20.400
 nature? That's something we should try to overcome? Well, as we discussed, my first priority is to

2:07:20.400 --> 2:07:24.560
 just tell people about it, to do the analysis and the cold facts of what's actually happening,

2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:28.800
 and then to try to be careful about how we can improve. So our book, The Elephant in the Rain,

2:07:28.800 --> 2:07:34.080
 coauthored with Kevin Simler, is about how we hidden motives in everyday life. And our first

2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:38.480
 priority there is just to explain to you what are the things that you are not looking at that you

2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:43.360
 have reluctant to look at. And many people try to take that book as a self help book where they're

2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:47.760
 trying to improve themselves and make sure they look at more things. And that often goes badly

2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:53.840
 because it's harder to actually do that than you think. Yeah. And so we at least want you to know

2:07:53.840 --> 2:07:58.640
 that this truth is available if you want to learn about it. It's the Nietzsche, if you gaze long

2:07:58.640 --> 2:08:05.200
 to the abyss, the abyss gazes into you. Let's talk about this elephant in the brain. Amazing book,

2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:10.720
 The Elephant in the Room is, quote, an important issue that people are reluctant to acknowledge

2:08:10.720 --> 2:08:16.560
 or address a social taboo. The elephant in the brain is an important but unacknowledged feature

2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:24.480
 of how our mind works and introspective taboo. You describe selfishness and self deception

2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:32.560
 as the core or some of the core elephants, some of the elephants, elephant offspring in the brain,

2:08:33.440 --> 2:08:41.520
 selfishness and self deception. All right. Can you explain, can you explain why these are

2:08:41.520 --> 2:08:47.760
 the taboos in our brain that we don't want to acknowledge to ourselves?

2:08:47.760 --> 2:08:52.320
 Your conscious mind, the one that's listening to me that I'm talking to at the moment,

2:08:52.880 --> 2:08:58.960
 you like to think of yourself as the president or king of your mind, ruling over all that you see

2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:06.240
 issuing commands that immediately obeyed, you are instead better understood as the press secretary

2:09:06.240 --> 2:09:12.800
 of your brain. You don't make decisions, you justify them to an audience. That's what your

2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:20.160
 conscious mind is for. You watch what you're doing and you try to come up with stories that

2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:26.560
 explain what you're doing so that you can avoid accusations of violating norms. Humans, compared

2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:31.520
 to most other animals, have norms and this allows us to manage larger groups with our

2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:36.880
 morals and norms about what we should or shouldn't be doing. This is so important to us that we

2:09:37.600 --> 2:09:42.400
 needed to be constantly watching what we were doing in order to make sure we had a good story

2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:48.080
 to avoid norm violations. Many norms are about motives. If I hit you on purpose, that's a big

2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:52.960
 violation of hit you accidentally, that's okay. I need to be able to explain why it was an accident

2:09:52.960 --> 2:09:58.400
 and not on purpose. Where does that need come from for your own self preservation?

2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:03.040
 Right. So humans have norms and we have the norm that if we see anybody violating a norm,

2:10:03.040 --> 2:10:09.200
 we need to tell other people and then coordinate to make them stop and punish them for violating.

2:10:09.200 --> 2:10:13.680
 So such benefits are strong enough and severe enough that we each want to avoid

2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:21.200
 being successfully accused of violating norms. So for example, hitting someone on purpose is a big

2:10:21.200 --> 2:10:25.040
 clear norm violation. If we do it consistently, we may be thrown out of the group and that would

2:10:25.040 --> 2:10:30.560
 mean we would die. So we need to be able to convince people we are not going around hitting

2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:36.080
 people on purpose. If somebody happens to be at the other end of our fist and their face

2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:39.680
 connects, that was an accident and we need to be able to explain that.

2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:47.280
 And similarly for many other norms humans have, we are serious about these norms and we don't want

2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:50.960
 people to violate them, we find them violating, we're going to accuse them. But many norms have

2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:56.800
 a motive component and so we are trying to explain ourselves and make sure we have a good motive

2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:02.160
 story about everything we do, which is why we're constantly trying to explain what we're doing

2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:07.040
 and that's what your conscious mind is doing. It is trying to make sure you've got a good motive

2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:11.040
 story for everything you're doing and that's why you don't know why you really do things.

2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:15.360
 What you know is what the good story is about why you've been doing things.

2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:21.200
 And that's the self deception and you're saying that there is a machine, the actual dictator

2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:25.680
 is selfish and then you're just the press secretary who's desperately doesn't want to get

2:11:25.680 --> 2:11:31.520
 fired and is justifying all of all the decisions of the dictator and that's the self deception.

2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:37.040
 Right. Now most people actually are willing to believe that this is true in the abstract. So

2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:41.760
 our book has been classified as psychology and it was reviewed by psychologists and the basic

2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:46.080
 way that psychology referees and reviewers responded to say this is well known.

2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:50.640
 Most people accept that there's a fair bit of self deception. But they don't want to accept it

2:11:50.640 --> 2:11:54.560
 about themselves directly. Well, they don't want to accept it about the particular topics that we

2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:59.200
 talk about. So people accept the idea in the abstract that they might be self deceived or

2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:03.600
 that they might not be honest about various things. But that hasn't penetrated into the

2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:07.280
 literatures where people are explaining particular things like why we go to school,

2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:13.120
 why we go to the doctor, why we vote, etc. So our book is mainly about 10 areas of life and

2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:19.520
 explaining about in each area what our actual motives there are. And people who study those

2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:25.440
 things have not admitted that hidden motives are explaining those particular areas.

2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:30.080
 They haven't taken the leap from theoretical psychology to actual public policy.

2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:30.800
 Exactly.

2:12:30.800 --> 2:12:33.920
 And economics and all that kind of stuff. Well, let me just linger on this

2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:42.880
 and bring up my old friends, Zingman Freud and Carl Jung. So how vast is this

2:12:45.360 --> 2:12:52.640
 landscape of the unconscious mind, the power and the scope of the dictator? Is it only dark there?

2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:56.720
 Is it some light? Is there some love?

2:12:56.720 --> 2:13:02.080
 The vast majority of what's happening in your head, you're unaware of. So in a literal sense,

2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:07.520
 the unconscious, the aspects of your mind that you're not conscious of is the overwhelming

2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:12.800
 majority. But that's just true in a literal engineering sense. Your mind is doing lots

2:13:12.800 --> 2:13:16.640
 of low level things and you just can't be consciously aware of all that low level stuff.

2:13:16.640 --> 2:13:19.680
 But there's plenty of room there for lots of things you're not aware of.

2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:26.800
 But can we try to shine a light at the things we're unaware of specifically, now again, staying

2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:32.080
 with the philosophical psychology side for a moment. Can you shine the light in the young in

2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:40.320
 shadow? What's going on there? What is this machine like? What level of thoughts are happening there?

2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:46.400
 Is it something that we can even interpret? If we somehow could visualize it, is it something

2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:52.160
 that's human interpretable? Or is it just a chaos of monitoring different systems in the body,

2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:58.400
 making sure you're happy, making sure you're fed all those kind of basic forces that form

2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:01.760
 abstractions on top of each other and they're not introspective at all.

2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:06.320
 We humans are social creatures. Plausibly, being social is the main reason we have these

2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:10.640
 unusually large brains. Therefore, most of our brain is devoted to being social.

2:14:11.920 --> 2:14:16.080
 And so the things we are very obsessed with and constantly paying attention to are,

2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:22.480
 how do I look to others? What would others think of me if they knew these various things they might

2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:26.480
 learn about me? So that's close to being fundamental to what it means to be human,

2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:32.640
 is caring what others think. Right. To be trying to present a story that would be okay for what

2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:37.520
 other things. But we're very constantly thinking, what do other people think? So let me ask you

2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:46.560
 this question then about you, Robin Hansen, who many places, sometimes for fun, sometimes as a

2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:52.800
 basic statement of principle, likes to disagree with what the majority of people think.

2:14:54.880 --> 2:15:02.560
 So how do you explain, how are you self deceiving yourself in this task? And how are you being

2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:08.960
 self, like, why is the dictator manipulating you inside your head to be so critical? Like,

2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:14.640
 there's norms. Why do you want to stand out in this way? Why do you want to challenge the

2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:18.880
 norms in this way? Almost by definition, I can't tell you what I'm deceiving myself about.

2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:24.640
 But the more practical strategy that's quite feasible is to ask about what are typical things

2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:29.280
 that most people deceive themselves about and then to own up to those particular things.

2:15:29.280 --> 2:15:36.720
 Sure. What's a good one? So for example, I can very much acknowledge that I would like to be

2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:46.800
 well thought of. Yes. That I would be seeking attention and glory and praise from my intellectual

2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:54.640
 work and that that would be a major agenda driving my intellectual attempts. So if there

2:15:54.640 --> 2:15:59.040
 were topics that other people would find less interesting, I might be less interested in those

2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:02.960
 for that reason. For example, I might want to find topics where other people are interested,

2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:10.320
 and I might want to go for the glory of finding a big insight rather than a small one.

2:16:11.840 --> 2:16:17.520
 And maybe one that was especially surprising. That's also, of course, consistent with some

2:16:17.520 --> 2:16:24.160
 more ideal concept of what an intellectual should be. But most intellectuals are relatively

2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:30.320
 risk averse. They are in some local intellectual tradition and they are adding to that and they

2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:35.680
 are staying conforming to the sort of usual assumptions and usual accepted beliefs and

2:16:35.680 --> 2:16:42.400
 practices of a particular area so that they can be accepted in that area and treated as part of

2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:49.120
 the community. But you might think for the purpose of the larger intellectual project of

2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:54.800
 understanding the world better, people should be less eager to just add a little bit to some

2:16:54.800 --> 2:16:58.960
 tradition and they should be looking for what's neglected between the major traditions and major

2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:02.560
 questions. They should be looking for assumptions maybe we're making that are wrong. They should

2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:06.800
 be looking at ways, things that are very surprising, like things that would be,

2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:12.480
 you would have thought a priori unlikely that once you are convinced of it, you find that to be

2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:23.440
 very important and a big update. So you could say that one motivation I might have is less

2:17:23.440 --> 2:17:28.800
 motivated to be sort of comfortably accepted into some particular intellectual community and more

2:17:28.800 --> 2:17:35.440
 willing to just go for these more fundamental long shots that should be very important if you

2:17:35.440 --> 2:17:44.880
 could find them. Which would, if you can find them, would get you appreciated across a larger

2:17:44.880 --> 2:17:52.720
 number of people across the longer time span of history. So like maybe the small local community

2:17:52.720 --> 2:18:00.640
 will say you suck, you must conform, but the larger community will see the brilliance of you

2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:06.960
 breaking out of the cage of the small conformity into a larger cage. There's always a bigger

2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:13.840
 cage and then you'll be remembered by more. Yeah, also that explains your choice of colorful

2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:19.760
 shirt that looks great in a black background, so you definitely stand out. Now of course,

2:18:19.760 --> 2:18:25.280
 you could say, well, you could get all this attention by making false claims of dramatic

2:18:25.280 --> 2:18:30.080
 improvement and then wouldn't that be much easier than actually working through all the details?

2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:36.640
 Why not? To make true claims. Let me ask the press secretary, why not? So of course you

2:18:36.640 --> 2:18:40.960
 spoke several times about how much you value truth and the pursuit of truth. That's a very

2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:48.400
 nice narrative. Hitler and Stalin also talked about the value of truth. Do you worry when you

2:18:48.400 --> 2:19:02.560
 introspect, as broadly as all humans might, that it becomes a drug? Being a martyr, being the person

2:19:02.560 --> 2:19:08.880
 who points out that the emperor wears no clothes, even when the emperor is obviously dressed,

2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:15.200
 just to be the person who points out that the emperor is wearing no clothes. Do you think about

2:19:15.200 --> 2:19:24.960
 that? So I think the standards you hold yourself to are dependent on the audience you have in mind.

2:19:26.160 --> 2:19:32.560
 So if you think of your audience as relatively easily fooled or relatively gullible, then you

2:19:32.560 --> 2:19:40.400
 won't bother to generate more complicated, deep arguments and structures and evidence to persuade

2:19:40.400 --> 2:19:45.920
 somebody who has higher standards because why bother? You can get away with something much

2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:51.600
 easier. And of course, if you are a salesperson or you make money on sales, then you don't need

2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:57.440
 to convince the top few percent of the most sharp customers. You can just go for the bottom 60% of

2:19:57.440 --> 2:20:05.840
 the most gullible customers and make plenty of sales. So I think one of the main ways

2:20:05.840 --> 2:20:11.120
 intellectuals varies in who is their audience in their mind? Who are they trying to impress? Is it

2:20:11.120 --> 2:20:16.240
 the people down the hall? Is it the people who are reading their Twitter feed? Is it their parents?

2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:25.760
 Is it their high school teacher? Or is it Einstein and Freud and Socrates? So I think those of us

2:20:25.760 --> 2:20:32.000
 who are especially arrogant, especially think that we're really big shot or have a chance at being

2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:36.560
 a really big shot. We're naturally going to pick the big shot audience that we can. We're going

2:20:36.560 --> 2:20:40.960
 to be trying to impress Socrates and Einstein. Is that why you're hanging out with Tyler Cohen a

2:20:40.960 --> 2:20:47.920
 lot and trying to convince him yourself? From the point of view of just making money or having

2:20:47.920 --> 2:20:55.680
 sex or other sorts of things, this is misdirected energy. Trying to impress the very most highest

2:20:55.680 --> 2:20:59.360
 quality minds, that's such a small sample and they can't do that much for you anyway.

2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:05.920
 Yeah. So I might well have had more ordinary success in life, be more popular, invited to

2:21:05.920 --> 2:21:13.520
 more parties, make more money if I had targeted a lower tier set of intellectuals with the standards

2:21:13.520 --> 2:21:19.920
 they have. But for some reason, I decided early on that Einstein was my audience or people like him

2:21:20.560 --> 2:21:26.080
 and I was going to impress them. Yeah. I mean, you pick your set of motivations,

2:21:26.080 --> 2:21:31.120
 you know, convincing, impressing Tyler Cohen is not going to help you get laid. Trust me,

2:21:31.120 --> 2:21:43.040
 I tried. All right. What are some notable sort of effects of the elephant in the brain in everyday

2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:48.960
 life? So you mentioned, when we tried to apply that to economics, to public policy,

2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:53.200
 so when we think about medicine, education, all those kinds of things, what are some things that

2:21:53.200 --> 2:21:59.280
 well, the key thing is medicine is much less useful health wise than you think. So, you know,

2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:04.000
 if you were focused on your health, you would care a lot less about it. And if you were focused

2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:09.280
 on other people's health, you would also care a lot less about it. But if medicine is, as we suggest,

2:22:09.280 --> 2:22:12.320
 more about showing that you care and let other people showing that they care about you,

2:22:13.120 --> 2:22:18.400
 then a lot of priority on medicine can make sense. So that was our very earliest discussion

2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:22.800
 in the podcast. You were talking about what should you give people a lot of medicine when

2:22:22.800 --> 2:22:27.360
 it's not very effective. And then the answer then is, well, if that's the way that you show

2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:32.080
 that you care about them and you really want them to know you care, then maybe that's what

2:22:32.080 --> 2:22:37.280
 you need to do if you can't find a cheaper, more effective substitute. So if we actually just pause

2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:44.720
 on that for a little bit, how do we start to untangle the full set of self deception happening

2:22:44.720 --> 2:22:49.840
 in the space of medicine? So we have a method that we use in our book that is what I recommend

2:22:49.840 --> 2:22:54.480
 for people to use in all these sorts of topics. The straightforward method is first, don't look

2:22:54.480 --> 2:23:00.800
 at yourself. Look at other people. Look at broad patterns of behavior in other people. And then

2:23:00.800 --> 2:23:05.920
 ask, what are the various theories we could have to explain these patterns of behavior? And then

2:23:05.920 --> 2:23:11.680
 just do the simple matching, which theory better matches the behavior they have. And the last step

2:23:11.680 --> 2:23:17.680
 is to assume that's true of YouTube. Don't assume you're an exception. If you happen to be an

2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:22.160
 exception, that won't go so well. But nevertheless, on average, you aren't very well positioned to

2:23:22.160 --> 2:23:27.440
 judge if you're an exception. So look at what other people do. Explain what other people do and

2:23:27.440 --> 2:23:34.320
 assume that's you too. But also, in the case of medicine, there's several parties to consider.

2:23:34.320 --> 2:23:38.880
 So there's the individual person that's receiving the medicine. There's the doctors that are prescribing

2:23:38.880 --> 2:23:45.280
 the medicine. There's drug companies that are selling drugs. There are governments that have

2:23:45.280 --> 2:23:51.200
 regulations that are lobbyists. So you can build up a network of categories of humans in this.

2:23:51.760 --> 2:24:00.400
 And they each play their role. So how do you introspect the sort of analyze the system at a

2:24:00.400 --> 2:24:07.040
 system scale versus at the individual scale? So it turns out that in general, it's usually much

2:24:07.040 --> 2:24:13.200
 easier to explain producer behavior than consumer behavior. That is, the drug companies or the

2:24:13.200 --> 2:24:19.280
 doctors have relatively clear incentives to give the customers whatever they want. And

2:24:19.280 --> 2:24:24.240
 certainly say governments in democratic countries have the incentive to give the voters what they

2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:31.760
 want. So that focuses your attention on the patient and the voter in this equation and saying,

2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:37.040
 what do they want? They would be driving the rest of the system. Whatever they want,

2:24:37.040 --> 2:24:42.720
 the other parties are willing to give them in order to get paid. So now we're looking for

2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:48.960
 puzzles in patient and voter behavior. What are they choosing and why do they choose that?

2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:56.160
 And how much exactly? And then we can explain that potentially again, returning to the producer

2:24:56.160 --> 2:25:01.360
 by the producer being incentivized to manipulate the decision making processes of the voter and

2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:08.000
 the consumer. Well, now in almost every industry, producers are in general happy to lie and exaggerate

2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:12.400
 in order to get more customers. This is true of auto repair as much as human body repair and

2:25:12.400 --> 2:25:17.760
 medicine. So the differences between these industries can't be explained by the willingness of the

2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:21.840
 producers to give customers what they want or to do various things that we have to again

2:25:22.400 --> 2:25:27.440
 go to the customers. Why are customers treating body repair different than auto repair?

2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:36.400
 Yeah, and that potentially requires a lot of thinking, a lot of data collection and potentially

2:25:36.400 --> 2:25:41.040
 looking at historical data too, because things don't just happen overnight. Over time there's

2:25:41.040 --> 2:25:45.600
 trends. In principle it does, but actually it's a lot actually easier than you might think. I think

2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:50.640
 the biggest limitation is just the willingness to consider alternative hypotheses. So many of the

2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:55.280
 patterns that you need to rely on are actually pretty obvious, simple patterns. You just have to

2:25:55.280 --> 2:26:00.720
 notice them and ask yourself, how can I explain those? Often you don't need to look at the most

2:26:00.720 --> 2:26:07.120
 subtle, most difficult statistical evidence that might be out there. The simplest patterns are

2:26:07.120 --> 2:26:12.640
 often enough. All right, so there's a fundamental statement about self deception in the book.

2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:18.880
 There's the application of that, like we just did in medicine. Can you steelman the argument that

2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:22.880
 many of the foundational ideas in the book are wrong?

2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:31.920
 Meaning there's two that you just made, which is it can be a lot simpler than it looks.

2:26:31.920 --> 2:26:38.240
 Can you steelman the case that it's case by case? It's always super complicated. Like it's a complex

2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:43.120
 system that's very difficult to have a simple model about. It's very difficult to disrespect.

2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:51.760
 And the other one is that the human brain isn't not just about self deception. That there's a lot of

2:26:53.040 --> 2:26:58.640
 there's a lot of motivation to play and we are able to really introspect our own mind. And like

2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:03.920
 what's on the surface of the conscious is actually quite a good representation of what's going on

2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:09.360
 in the brain and you're not deceiving yourself. You're able to actually arrive to deeply think

2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:14.000
 about where your mind stands and what you think about the world. And it's less about impressing

2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:17.440
 people and more about being a free thinking individual.

2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:24.320
 So when a child tries to explain why they don't have their homework assignment,

2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:30.960
 they are sometimes inclined to say, the dog ate my homework. They almost never say the dragon ate

2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:38.320
 my homework. The reason is the dragon is a completely implausible explanation. Almost always

2:27:38.320 --> 2:27:44.080
 when we make excuses for things, we choose things that are at least in some degree plausible. It

2:27:44.080 --> 2:27:51.280
 could perhaps have happened. That's an obstacle for any explanation of a hidden motive or a

2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:57.520
 hidden motive or a hidden feature of human behavior. If people are pretending one thing while really

2:27:57.520 --> 2:28:01.840
 doing another, they're usually going to pick as a pretense something that's somewhat plausible.

2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:09.520
 That's going to be an obstacle to proving that hypothesis. If you are focused on sort of the

2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:13.600
 local data that a person would typically have if they were challenged. So if you're just looking

2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:19.680
 at one kid in his lack of homework, maybe you can't tell whether his dog ate his homework or not.

2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:25.040
 If you happen to know he doesn't have a dog, you might have more confidence, right? You will need

2:28:25.040 --> 2:28:29.360
 to have a wider range of evidence than a typical person would when they're encountering that

2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:36.080
 actual excuse in order to see past the excuse. That will just be a general feature of it. So

2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:40.080
 in order, if what if I say, there's this usual story about where we go to the doctor and then

2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:45.200
 there's this other explanation, it'll be true that you'll have to look at wider data in order

2:28:45.200 --> 2:28:51.600
 to see that because people don't usually offer excuses unless in the local context of their

2:28:51.600 --> 2:28:58.160
 excuse, they can get away with it. That is, it's hard to tell, right? So in the case of medicine,

2:28:58.160 --> 2:29:05.200
 I have to point you to sort of larger sets of data. But in many areas of academia, including

2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:10.720
 health economics, the researchers there also want to support the usual points of view.

2:29:10.720 --> 2:29:16.800
 And so they will have selection effects in their publications and their analysis whereby they,

2:29:17.440 --> 2:29:21.280
 if they're getting a result too much contrary to the usual point of view everybody wants to have,

2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:27.120
 they will file, draw that paper or redo the analysis until they get an answer that's more

2:29:27.120 --> 2:29:32.640
 to people's liking. So that means in the health economics literature, there are plenty of people

2:29:32.640 --> 2:29:39.200
 who will claim that in fact, we have evidence that medicine is effective. And when I respond,

2:29:39.200 --> 2:29:45.760
 I will have to point you to our most reliable evidence and ask you to consider the possibility

2:29:45.760 --> 2:29:50.640
 that the literature is biased in that when the evidence isn't as reliable, when they have more

2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:54.960
 degrees of freedom in order to get the answer they want, they do tend to get the answer they want.

2:29:54.960 --> 2:30:01.520
 But when we get to the kind of evidence that's much harder to mess with, that's where we will see

2:30:01.520 --> 2:30:07.760
 the truth be more revealed. So with respect to medicine, we have millions of papers published

2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:12.160
 in medicine over the years, most of which give the impression that medicine is useful.

2:30:13.440 --> 2:30:19.040
 There's a small literature on randomized experiments of the aggregate effects of medicine

2:30:19.040 --> 2:30:26.320
 where there's maybe a few half dozen or so papers where it would be the hardest to hide it

2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:34.560
 because it's such a straightforward experiment done in a straightforward way that it's hard

2:30:34.560 --> 2:30:39.440
 to manipulate. And that's where I will point you to to show you that there's relatively little

2:30:39.440 --> 2:30:44.400
 correlation between health and medicine. But even then, people could try to save the phenomenon and

2:30:44.400 --> 2:30:47.600
 say, well, it's not hidden motives, it's just ignorance. They could say, for example,

2:30:49.440 --> 2:30:55.600
 medicine's complicated, most people don't know the literature. Therefore, they can be excused

2:30:55.600 --> 2:31:00.240
 for ignorance. They are just ignorantly assuming that medicine is effective. It's not that they

2:31:00.240 --> 2:31:06.560
 have some other motive that they're trying to achieve. And then I will have to do, as with a

2:31:06.560 --> 2:31:12.480
 conspiracy theory analysis, and I'm saying, well, how long has this misperception been going on?

2:31:12.480 --> 2:31:19.520
 How consistently has it happened around the world and across time? And I would have to say, look,

2:31:19.520 --> 2:31:24.640
 if we're talking about, say, a recent new product like Segway scooters or something,

2:31:25.280 --> 2:31:29.120
 I could say not so many people have seen them or used them. Maybe they could be confused about

2:31:29.120 --> 2:31:32.720
 their value. If we're talking about a product that's been around for thousands of years,

2:31:32.720 --> 2:31:37.440
 used in roughly the same way all across the world, and we see the same pattern over and over again,

2:31:38.160 --> 2:31:41.200
 this sort of ignorance mistake just doesn't work so well.

2:31:41.760 --> 2:31:49.840
 It also is a question of how much of the self deception is prevalent versus foundational,

2:31:50.400 --> 2:31:56.880
 because there's a kind of implied thing where it's foundational to human nature versus just

2:31:56.880 --> 2:32:04.800
 a common pitfall. This is a question I have. So maybe human progress is made by people

2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:11.600
 who don't fall into the self deception. It's a baser aspect of human nature,

2:32:11.600 --> 2:32:14.560
 but then you escape it easily if you're motivated.

2:32:15.760 --> 2:32:20.880
 The motivational hypotheses about the self deceptions are in terms of how it makes you

2:32:20.880 --> 2:32:25.120
 look to the people around you. Again, the press secretary. So the story would be,

2:32:25.120 --> 2:32:30.720
 most people want to look good to the people around them. Therefore, most people present

2:32:30.720 --> 2:32:37.200
 themselves in ways that help them look good to the people around them. That's sufficient

2:32:37.200 --> 2:32:42.960
 to say there would be a lot of it. It doesn't need to be 100%. There's enough variety in people

2:32:42.960 --> 2:32:47.200
 and in circumstances that sometimes taking a contrarian strategy can be in the interest of

2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:52.480
 some minority of the people. So I might, for example, say that that's a strategy I've taken.

2:32:52.480 --> 2:33:00.880
 I've decided that being contrarian on these things could be winning for me in that there's a room

2:33:00.880 --> 2:33:06.480
 for a small number of people like me who have these sort of messages who can then get more

2:33:06.480 --> 2:33:12.720
 attention even if there's not room for most people to do that. And that can be explaining

2:33:12.720 --> 2:33:17.600
 sort of the variety. Similarly, you might say, look, just look at most obvious things. Most

2:33:17.600 --> 2:33:21.200
 people would like to look good in the sense of physically, just you look good right now,

2:33:21.200 --> 2:33:24.960
 you're wearing a nice suit, you have a haircut, you shaved, right? So and we...

2:33:24.960 --> 2:33:26.080
 Got my own hair, by the way.

2:33:26.080 --> 2:33:28.000
 Okay. Well then, all the more impressive.

2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:32.960
 That's a counter argument for your client though most people want to look good.

2:33:32.960 --> 2:33:36.400
 Clearly, if we look at most people and their physical appearance, clearly most people are

2:33:36.400 --> 2:33:40.880
 trying to look somewhat nice, right? They shower, they shave, they comb their hair,

2:33:40.880 --> 2:33:44.720
 but we certainly see some people around who are not trying to look so nice, right? Is that a

2:33:45.280 --> 2:33:50.240
 big challenge, the hypothesis that people want to look nice? Not that much, right? We can see

2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:55.840
 in those particular people's context more particular reasons why they've chosen to

2:33:55.840 --> 2:33:57.520
 be an exception to the more general rule.

2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:02.240
 So the general rule does reveal something foundational generally.

2:34:03.760 --> 2:34:04.240
 Right.

2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:08.640
 That's the way things work. Let me ask you, you wrote a blog post about the accuracy of

2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:15.600
 authorities since we were talking about this, especially in medicine. Just looking around us,

2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:21.840
 especially during this time of the pandemic, there's been a growing distrust of authorities,

2:34:21.840 --> 2:34:30.800
 of institutions, even an institution of science itself. What are the pros and cons of authorities,

2:34:30.800 --> 2:34:38.240
 would you say? So what's nice about authorities? What's nice about institutions and what are

2:34:38.240 --> 2:34:39.040
 their pitfalls?

2:34:39.040 --> 2:34:46.640
 One standard function of authority is as something you can defer to respectively without

2:34:46.640 --> 2:34:59.440
 needing to seem too submissive or ignorant or gullible. That is, when you're asking what should

2:34:59.440 --> 2:35:06.320
 I act on or what belief should I act on, you might be worried if I chose something too contrarian,

2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:12.400
 too weird, too speculative, that would make me look bad. So I would just choose something

2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:18.080
 very conservative. So maybe an authority lets you choose something a little less conservative

2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:24.160
 because the authority is your authorization. The authority will let you do it and somebody

2:35:24.160 --> 2:35:28.720
 says, why did you do that thing? And they say, the authority authorized. The authority tells me,

2:35:28.720 --> 2:35:31.440
 I should do this. Why aren't you doing it? Right.

2:35:31.440 --> 2:35:34.400
 So the authority is often pushing for the conservative.

2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:40.240
 Well, the authority can do more. So for example, we just think about, I don't know, in a pandemic

2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:44.640
 even, you could just think, I'll just stay home and close all the doors or I'll just ignore it.

2:35:44.640 --> 2:35:49.040
 You could just think of some very simple strategy that might be defensible if there were no

2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:54.960
 authorities. But authorities might be able to know more than that. They might be able to look

2:35:54.960 --> 2:36:00.400
 at some evidence, draw a more context dependent conclusion, declare it as the authority's opinion,

2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:02.960
 and then other people might follow that. And that could be better than doing nothing.

2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:12.960
 So what you mentioned, WHO, the world's most beloved organization. So this is me speaking

2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:24.720
 in general, WHO and CDC has been kind of, depending on degrees and details, just not

2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:31.520
 behaving as I would have imagined in the best possible evolution of human civilization,

2:36:31.520 --> 2:36:37.200
 authorities should act. They seem to have failed in some fundamental way in terms of

2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:43.360
 leadership in a difficult time for our society. Can you say what are the pros and cons of this

2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:50.320
 particular authority? So again, if there were no authorities whatsoever, no accepted authorities,

2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:56.240
 then people would sort of have to sort of randomly pick different local authorities

2:36:56.240 --> 2:36:59.840
 who would conflict with each other and then they'd be fighting each other about that or just

2:36:59.840 --> 2:37:04.560
 not believe anybody and just do some initial default action that you would always do without

2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:10.560
 responding to context. So the potential gain of an authority is that they could know more than just

2:37:10.560 --> 2:37:16.240
 basic ignorance. And if people followed them, they could both be more informed than ignorance

2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:20.880
 and all doing the same thing. So they're each protected from being accused or complained about.

2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:23.840
 That's the idea of an authority. That would be the good.

2:37:24.720 --> 2:37:26.960
 What's the con? Okay.

2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:33.760
 So the con is that if you think of yourself as the authority and asking what's my best

2:37:33.760 --> 2:37:40.880
 strategy as an authority, it's unfortunately not to be maximally informative. So you might

2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:45.920
 think the ideal authority would not just tell you more than ignorance, it would tell you as much as

2:37:45.920 --> 2:37:52.160
 possible. Okay, it would give you as much detail as you could possibly listen to and manage to

2:37:52.160 --> 2:37:57.840
 assimilate. And it would update that as frequently as possible or as frequently as you were able to

2:37:57.840 --> 2:38:03.520
 listen and assimilate. And that would be the maximally informative authority. The problem is

2:38:03.520 --> 2:38:10.160
 there's a conflict between being an authority or being seen as an authority and being maximally

2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:16.320
 informative. That was the point of my blog post that you're pointing out to here. That is, if you

2:38:16.320 --> 2:38:24.160
 look at it from their point of view, they won't long remain the perceived authority if they are too

2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:31.120
 unconscious about how they use that authority. And one of the ways to be

2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:36.960
 unconscious would be to be too informative. Okay, that's still in the pro call for me.

2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:43.200
 Because you're talking about the tensions that are very data driven and very honest. And I would

2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:49.840
 hope that authorities struggle with that how much information to provide to people to maximize

2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:56.480
 to maximize outcomes. Now I'm generally somebody that believes more information is better because

2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:02.800
 I trust in the intelligence of people. But I'd like to mention a bigger con authorities,

2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:08.800
 which is the human question. This comes back to global government and so on, is that, you know,

2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:15.760
 there's humans that sit in chairs during meetings in those authorities, they have different titles,

2:39:15.760 --> 2:39:20.800
 it's for humans form hierarchies. And sometimes those titles get to your head a little bit.

2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:26.960
 And you start to want to think how do I preserve my control over this authority, as opposed to

2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:32.720
 thinking through like, what is the mission of the authority? What is the mission of WHO and

2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:39.040
 other such organization? And how do I maximize the implementation of that mission? You start to think,

2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:43.760
 well, I kind of like sitting in this big chair at the head of the table. I'd like to sit there

2:39:43.760 --> 2:39:49.920
 for another few years. Or better yet, I want to be remembered as the person who in a time of crisis

2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:57.840
 was at the head of this authority and did a lot of good things. So you stop trying to do good

2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:04.320
 under what good means given the mission of the authority. And you start to try to carve a narrative

2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:10.080
 to manipulate the narrative first in the meeting room, everybody around you, just a small little

2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:16.080
 story you tell yourself, then you interns the managers throughout the whole hierarchy of the

2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:21.360
 company. Okay, once you everybody in the company, or in the organization believes this narrative,

2:40:21.360 --> 2:40:28.080
 now you start to control this, the release of information, not because you're trying to maximize

2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:33.840
 outcomes, but because you're trying to maximize the effectiveness of the narrative that you are truly

2:40:33.840 --> 2:40:40.720
 a great representative of this authority in human history. And I just feel like those human forces,

2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:47.680
 whenever you have an authority, it starts getting to people's heads. One of the most,

2:40:47.680 --> 2:40:52.320
 one of the most, this me as a scientist, one of the most disappointing things to see during the

2:40:52.320 --> 2:41:04.160
 pandemic is the use of authority from colleagues of mine to roll their eyes to dismiss other human

2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:11.760
 beings just because they got a PhD, just because they're an assistant associate full faculty,

2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:20.640
 just because they are deputy head of X organization, NIH, whatever the heck the organization is,

2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:26.720
 just because they got an award of some kind. And at a conference, they won a best paper award

2:41:26.720 --> 2:41:32.560
 seven years ago, and then somebody shook their hand and gave them a medal, maybe it was a president.

2:41:32.560 --> 2:41:37.520
 And there and it's been 20, 30 years that people have been patting them on the back saying how

2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:43.040
 special they are, especially when they are controlling money and getting sucked up to

2:41:43.040 --> 2:41:47.200
 from other scientists who really want the money in a self deception kind of way. They don't actually

2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:52.000
 really care about your performance. And all of that gets to your head. And no longer are you the

2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:57.280
 authority that's trying to do good and lessen the suffering in the world, you become an authority

2:41:57.280 --> 2:42:05.440
 that just wants to maximize self preserve yourself in a sitting on a throne of power.

2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:11.040
 So this is core to sort of what it is to be an economist. I'm a professor of economics.

2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:18.000
 There you go with the authority again. No. So it's about saying we often have a situation

2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:24.400
 where we see a world of behavior, and then we see ways in which particular behaviors are not

2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:32.560
 sort of maximally socially useful. And we have a variety of reactions to that. So one kind of

2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:37.760
 reaction is to sort of morally blame each individual for not doing the maximally socially

2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:44.560
 useful thing under perhaps the idea that people could be identified and shamed for that and

2:42:44.560 --> 2:42:49.360
 maybe induced into doing the better thing if only enough people were calling them out on it.

2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:54.320
 But another way to think about it is to think that people sit in institutions

2:42:55.040 --> 2:43:00.560
 with certain stable institutional structures and that institutions create particular incentives

2:43:00.560 --> 2:43:07.360
 for individuals and that individuals are typically doing whatever is in their local interest in the

2:43:07.360 --> 2:43:14.560
 context of that institution. And then perhaps to less blame individuals for winning their local

2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:20.160
 institutional game and more blaming the world for having the wrong institutions. So economists are

2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:24.560
 often like wondering what other institutions we could have instead of the ones we have and which

2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:29.600
 of them might promote better behavior. And this is a common thing we do all across human behavior

2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:33.760
 is to think of what are the institutions we're in and what are the alternative variations we

2:43:33.760 --> 2:43:39.840
 could imagine and then to say which institutions would be most productive. I would agree with you

2:43:39.840 --> 2:43:44.960
 that our information institutions, that is the institutions by which we collect information

2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:51.200
 and aggregate it and share it with people, are especially broken in the sense of far from the

2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:56.960
 ideal of what would be the most cost effective way to collect and share information. But then

2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:02.880
 the challenge is to try to produce better institutions. And as an academic, I'm aware

2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:09.600
 that academia is particularly broken in the sense that we give people incentives to do research

2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:14.880
 that's not very interesting or important because basically they're being impressive and we actually

2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:18.960
 care more about whether academics are impressive than whether they're interesting or useful.

2:44:20.160 --> 2:44:25.920
 And I can go happy to go into detail with lots of different known institutions and their known

2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:31.520
 institutional failings, ways in which those institutions produce incentives that are mistaken.

2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:35.680
 And that was the point of the post we started with talking about the authorities. If I need to

2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:42.240
 be seen as an authority, that's at odds with my being informative and I might choose to be the

2:44:42.240 --> 2:44:45.520
 authority instead of being informative because that's my institutional incentives.

2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:54.320
 And if I may, I'd like to, given that beautiful picture of incentives and individuals that you

2:44:54.320 --> 2:45:03.440
 just painted, let me just apologize for a couple of things. One, I often put too much blame on

2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:11.280
 leaders of institutions versus the incentives that govern those institutions. And as a result of that,

2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:20.400
 I've been, I believe, too critical of Anthony Fauci, too emotional about my criticism of Anthony

2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:26.560
 Fauci. And I'd like to apologize for that because I think there's a deep, there's deeper truth to

2:45:26.560 --> 2:45:32.560
 think about. There's deeper incentives to think about. That said, I do sort of, I'm a romantic

2:45:32.560 --> 2:45:42.720
 creature by nature. I romanticize Winston Churchill and I, when I think about Nazi Germany, I think

2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:47.680
 about Hitler more than I do about the individual people of Nazi Germany. You think about leaders,

2:45:47.680 --> 2:45:52.560
 you think about individuals, not necessarily the parameters, the incentives that govern

2:45:52.560 --> 2:45:58.160
 the system that, because it's harder. It's harder to think through deeply about the models

2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:04.720
 from which those individuals arise, but that's the right thing to do. But also, I don't apologize

2:46:06.240 --> 2:46:12.480
 for being emotional sometimes. I'm happy to blame the individual leaders in the sense that I might

2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:17.280
 say, well, you should be trying to reform these institutions if you're just there to get promoted

2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:22.160
 and look good at being at the top. But maybe I can blame you for your motives and your priorities

2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:26.240
 in there. But I can understand why the people at the top would be the people who are selected for

2:46:26.240 --> 2:46:29.600
 having the priority of primarily trying to get to the top. I get that.

2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:37.440
 Can I maybe ask you about particularly universities? They've received, like science has received an

2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:43.840
 increase in distrust overall as an institution, which breaks my heart because I think science is

2:46:43.840 --> 2:46:51.840
 beautiful as a, not maybe not as an institution, but as one of the things, one of the journeys that

2:46:51.840 --> 2:46:58.960
 humans have taken on. The other one is university. I think university is actually a place for me at

2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:07.440
 least in the way I see it is a place of freedom of exploring ideas, scientific ideas, engineering

2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:15.200
 ideas, more than a corporate, more than a company, more than a lot of domains in life.

2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:23.440
 It's not just in its ideal, but it's in its implementation, a place where you can be a kid

2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:29.040
 for your whole life and play with ideas. And I think with all the criticism that universities

2:47:29.040 --> 2:47:35.440
 still not currently receive, I think they, I don't think that criticism is representative

2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:39.840
 of universities. They focus on very anecdotal evidence of particular departments, particular

2:47:39.840 --> 2:47:48.400
 people, but I still feel like there's a lot of place for freedom of thought, at least, you know,

2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:55.120
 MIT, at least in the fields I care about, you know, in particular kind of science,

2:47:55.920 --> 2:48:01.040
 particular kind of technical fields, you know, mathematics, computer science, physics,

2:48:01.040 --> 2:48:06.880
 engineering, so robotics, artificial intelligence. This is a place where you get to be a kid. Yet

2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:15.920
 there is bureaucracy that's, that's rising up. There's like more rules, there's more meetings,

2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:22.960
 and there's more administration, having like PowerPoint presentations, which to me, you should

2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:34.080
 like be more of a renegade explorer of ideas and meetings destroy, they suffocate that radical

2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:37.680
 thought that happens when you're an undergraduate student and you can do all kinds of wild things

2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:42.240
 when you're a graduate student. Anyway, all that to say, you've thought about this aspect too. Is

2:48:42.240 --> 2:48:50.240
 there something positive, insightful you could say about how we can make for better universities

2:48:50.240 --> 2:48:54.800
 in the decades to come, this particular institution? How can we improve them?

2:48:55.360 --> 2:49:02.560
 I hear that centuries ago, many scientists and intellectuals were aristocrats. They had time

2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:11.360
 and could, if they chose, choose to be intellectuals. That's a feature of the

2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:17.680
 combination that they had some source of resources that allowed them leisure and that the kind of

2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:24.160
 competition they were faced in among aristocrats allowed that sort of a self indulgence or

2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:32.240
 self pursuit at least at some point in their lives. The analogous observation is that

2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:39.120
 university professors often have sort of the freedom and space to do a wide range of things,

2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:41.600
 and I am certainly enjoying that as a tenured professor.

2:49:41.600 --> 2:49:48.080
 You're a really, sorry to interrupt, a really good representative of that. Just the exploration

2:49:48.080 --> 2:49:54.560
 you're doing, the depth of thought that most people are afraid to do, the kind of broad

2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:58.560
 thinking that you're doing, which is great. The fact that that can happen is a combination of

2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:03.280
 these two things analogously. One is that we have fierce competition to become a tenured

2:50:03.280 --> 2:50:07.520
 professor, but then once you become tenured, we give you the freedom to do what you like,

2:50:07.520 --> 2:50:14.320
 and that's a happenstance. It didn't have to be that way, and in many other walks of life,

2:50:14.320 --> 2:50:18.560
 even though people have a lot of resources, etc., they don't have that kind of freedom set up.

2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:24.080
 So I think we're kind of, I'm kind of lucky that tenure exists and that I'm enjoying it,

2:50:25.280 --> 2:50:30.160
 but I can't be too enthusiastic about this unless I can approve of sort of the source

2:50:30.160 --> 2:50:33.840
 of the resources that's paying for all this. So for the aristocrat, if you thought they

2:50:33.840 --> 2:50:39.040
 they stole it in war or something, you wouldn't be so pleased. Whereas if you thought they had

2:50:39.040 --> 2:50:43.360
 earned it or their ancestors had earned this money that they were spending as an aristocrat,

2:50:43.360 --> 2:50:49.440
 then you could be more okay with that. So for universities, I have to ask, where are the main

2:50:49.440 --> 2:50:53.680
 sources of resources that are going to the universities and are they getting their money

2:50:53.680 --> 2:50:59.440
 source? Are they getting a good value for that payment? So first of all, they're students,

2:50:59.440 --> 2:51:05.280
 and the question is, are students getting good value for their education? And

2:51:06.560 --> 2:51:12.080
 each person is getting value in the sense that they are identified and shown to be a more capable

2:51:12.080 --> 2:51:17.440
 person, which is then worth more salary as an employee later. But there is a case for saying

2:51:17.440 --> 2:51:22.560
 there's a big waste to the system because we aren't actually changing the students who are

2:51:22.560 --> 2:51:28.400
 educating them. We're more sorting them or labeling them. And that's a very expensive

2:51:28.400 --> 2:51:33.600
 process to produce that outcome. And part of the expense is the freedom from tenure I get.

2:51:33.600 --> 2:51:38.720
 So I feel like I can't be too proud of that because it's basically attacks on all these

2:51:38.720 --> 2:51:42.720
 young students to pay this enormous amount of money in order to be labeled as better,

2:51:42.720 --> 2:51:45.760
 whereas I feel like we should be able to find cheaper ways of doing that.

2:51:46.960 --> 2:51:53.360
 The other main customer is researcher patrons like the government or other foundations. And

2:51:53.360 --> 2:51:57.360
 then the question is, are they getting their money worth out of the money they're paying

2:51:57.360 --> 2:52:04.480
 for research to happen? And my analysis is they don't actually care about the research progress.

2:52:04.480 --> 2:52:08.400
 They are mainly buying an affiliation with credentialed impressiveness on the part of the

2:52:08.400 --> 2:52:12.960
 researchers. They mainly pay money to researchers who are impressive and have

2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:17.920
 impressive affiliations, and they don't really much care what research project happens as a result.

2:52:17.920 --> 2:52:27.520
 Is that a cynical? So there's a deep truth to that cynical perspective. Is there a less cynical

2:52:27.520 --> 2:52:33.600
 perspective that they do care about the long term investment into the progress of science and

2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:39.040
 humanity? Well, they might personally care, but they're stuck in an equilibrium wherein they

2:52:39.040 --> 2:52:44.480
 basically most foundations like governments or research or like the Ford Foundation,

2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:50.880
 they are the individuals there are rated based on the prestige they bring to that organization.

2:52:52.160 --> 2:52:55.360
 And even if they might personally want to produce more intellectual progress,

2:52:55.360 --> 2:53:01.120
 they are in a competitive game where they don't have tenure and they need to produce this prestige.

2:53:01.120 --> 2:53:05.520
 And so once they give grant money to prestigious people, that is the thing that shows that they

2:53:05.520 --> 2:53:09.440
 have achieved prestige for the organization. And that's what they need to do in order to retain

2:53:09.440 --> 2:53:15.680
 their position. And you do hope that there's a correlation between prestige and actual

2:53:15.680 --> 2:53:20.400
 competence? Of course there is a correlation. The question is just, could we do this better

2:53:20.400 --> 2:53:25.600
 some other way? Yes. I think it's almost, I think it's pretty clear we could. What is harder to do

2:53:25.600 --> 2:53:31.440
 is move the world to a new equilibrium where we do that instead. What are the components

2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:40.480
 of the better ways to do it? Is it money? So how the sources of money and how the money is allocated

2:53:40.480 --> 2:53:47.360
 to give the individual researchers freedom? Years ago, I started studying this topic exactly

2:53:47.360 --> 2:53:51.920
 because this was my issue. And this was many decades ago now. And I spent a long time. And

2:53:51.920 --> 2:53:58.240
 my best guess still is prediction markets, betting markets. So if you as a research

2:53:58.240 --> 2:54:02.800
 paper, patron want to know the answer to a particular question, like what's the mass of

2:54:02.800 --> 2:54:08.480
 the electron neutrino, then what you can do is just subsidize a betting market in that question.

2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:13.440
 And that will induce more research into answering that question because the people who then

2:54:13.440 --> 2:54:17.120
 answer that question can then make money in that betting market with the new information they gain.

2:54:17.680 --> 2:54:23.600
 So that's a robust way to induce more information on a topic. If you want to induce an accomplishment,

2:54:23.600 --> 2:54:28.880
 you can create prizes. And there's, of course, a long history of prizes to induce accomplishments.

2:54:29.520 --> 2:54:35.680
 And we moved away from prizes, even though we once used them a far more often than we did today.

2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:44.080
 And there's a history to that. And for the customers who want to be affiliated with impressive

2:54:44.080 --> 2:54:48.640
 academics, which is what most of the customers want, students, journalists and patrons, I think

2:54:48.640 --> 2:54:53.200
 there's a better way of doing that, which I just wrote about in my second most recent

2:54:53.200 --> 2:54:59.200
 blog post. Can you explain? Sure. What we do today is we take sort of acceptance by other

2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:06.080
 academics recently as our best indication of their deserved prestige, that is recent publications,

2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:13.840
 recent job affiliation, institutional affiliations, recent invitations to speak, recent grants.

2:55:14.720 --> 2:55:22.480
 We are today taking other impressive academics recent choices to affiliate with them as our best

2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:28.960
 estimate of their prestige. I would say we could do better by creating betting markets in what the

2:55:28.960 --> 2:55:34.960
 distant future will judge to have been their deserved prestige looking back on them. I think

2:55:34.960 --> 2:55:40.800
 most intellectuals, for example, think that if we looked back two centuries, say two intellectuals

2:55:40.800 --> 2:55:46.560
 from two centuries ago, and tried to look in detail at their research and how it influenced

2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:53.920
 future research and which path it was on, we could much but more accurately judge their actual

2:55:53.920 --> 2:55:57.760
 deserved prestige, that is who was actually on the right track, who actually helped,

2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:03.200
 which will be different than what people at the time judged using the immediate indications of

2:56:03.200 --> 2:56:06.880
 the time at which position they had or which publications they had or things like that.

2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:12.160
 So in this way, if you think from the perspective of multiple centuries,

2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:19.840
 you would higher prioritize true novelty, you would disregard the temporal proximity,

2:56:19.840 --> 2:56:27.280
 like how recent the thing is, and you would think like, what is the brave, the bold, the big novel

2:56:27.280 --> 2:56:32.400
 idea that this, and you would actually be able to rate that because you could see the path with

2:56:32.400 --> 2:56:36.880
 which ideas took, which things had dead ends, which led to what other followings. You could,

2:56:36.880 --> 2:56:42.560
 looking back centuries later, have a much better estimate of who actually had what long term

2:56:42.560 --> 2:56:47.840
 effects on intellectual progress. So my proposal is, we actually pay people in several centuries

2:56:47.840 --> 2:56:52.160
 to do this historical analysis. And we have betting, we have prediction markets today,

2:56:52.160 --> 2:56:56.880
 where we buy and sell assets, which will later off pay off in terms of those final evaluations.

2:56:57.520 --> 2:57:01.760
 So now we'll be inducing people today to make their best estimate of those things by actually

2:57:01.760 --> 2:57:07.440
 looking at the details of people and setting the prices according. And so my proposal would be,

2:57:07.440 --> 2:57:12.240
 we rate people today on those prices today. So instead of looking at their list of publications

2:57:12.240 --> 2:57:17.760
 or affiliations, you look at the actual price of assets that represent people's best guess

2:57:17.760 --> 2:57:19.280
 of what the future will say about them.

2:57:19.280 --> 2:57:26.400
 That's brilliant. So this concept of idea futures, can you elaborate what this would entail?

2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:32.560
 Well, I've been elaborating two versions of it here. So one is, if there's a particular

2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:37.760
 question, say the mass of the electron neutrino, and what you as a patron want to do is get an

2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:43.040
 answer to that question, then what you would do is subsidize the betting market in that question

2:57:43.040 --> 2:57:46.880
 under the assumption that eventually we'll just know the answer and we can pay off the bets that

2:57:46.880 --> 2:57:52.320
 way. And that is a plausible assumption for many kinds of concrete intellectual questions like

2:57:52.320 --> 2:57:57.040
 what's the mass of the electron neutrino. In this hypothetical world, constructing that may be a

2:57:57.040 --> 2:58:06.320
 real world, do you mean literally financial? Yes, literal. Very literal. Very cash. Very direct

2:58:06.320 --> 2:58:16.240
 and literal. Yes. So the idea would be research labs would be for profit. They would have as

2:58:16.240 --> 2:58:20.720
 their expense paying researchers to study things. And then their profit would come from using the

2:58:20.720 --> 2:58:26.800
 insights the researchers gains to trade in these financial markets. Just like hedge funds today

2:58:26.800 --> 2:58:32.000
 make money by paying researchers to study firms and then making their profits by trading on those

2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:38.080
 that insight in the ordinary financial market. And the market would, if it's efficient, would be

2:58:38.080 --> 2:58:43.440
 able to become better and better at predicting the powerful ideas that the individual is able

2:58:43.440 --> 2:58:47.920
 to generate. The variance around the mass of the electron neutrino would decrease with time as we

2:58:47.920 --> 2:58:52.480
 learn that value of that parameter better and any other parameters that we want to estimate.

2:58:52.480 --> 2:58:58.080
 You don't think those markets would also respond to recency of prestige and all those kinds of

2:58:58.080 --> 2:59:02.560
 things? Well, they would respond. But the question is if they might respond incorrectly,

2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:07.280
 but if you think they're doing it incorrectly, you have a profit opportunity where you can go

2:59:07.280 --> 2:59:12.480
 fix it. So we'd be inviting everybody to ask whether they can find any biases or errors in the

2:59:12.480 --> 2:59:15.680
 current ways in which people are estimating these things from whatever clues they have.

2:59:15.680 --> 2:59:19.840
 Right. There's a big incentive for the correction mechanism in academia currently.

2:59:22.320 --> 2:59:26.720
 It's the safe choice to go with the prestige and there's no.

2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:30.880
 Even if you privately think that the prestige is overrated.

2:59:30.880 --> 2:59:35.920
 Even if you think strongly that it's overrated. Still, you don't have an incentive to defy that

2:59:35.920 --> 2:59:42.560
 publicly. You're going to lose a lot unless you're a contrarian that writes brilliant blogs.

2:59:42.560 --> 2:59:47.520
 And then you could talk about or have. Right. Initially, this was my initial

2:59:47.520 --> 2:59:51.840
 concept of having these betting markets on these key parameters. What I then realized over time was

2:59:51.840 --> 2:59:56.480
 that that's more what people pretend to care about. What they really mostly care about is just who's

2:59:56.480 --> 3:00:01.760
 how good. And that's what most of the system is built on is trying to rate people and rank them.

3:00:01.760 --> 3:00:06.640
 And so I designed this other alternative based on historical evaluations centuries later just

3:00:06.640 --> 3:00:13.520
 about who's how good because that's what I think most of the customers really care about. Customers.

3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:17.840
 I like the word customers here. Humans. Right. Well, every major area of life,

3:00:18.400 --> 3:00:23.040
 which has specialists who get paid to do that thing, must have some customers from elsewhere who

3:00:23.040 --> 3:00:29.280
 are paying for it. Well, who are the customers for the mass of the neutrino? Yes. I understand

3:00:29.280 --> 3:00:36.720
 the sense people who are willing to pay right for thing. That's an important thing to understand

3:00:36.720 --> 3:00:40.640
 about anything who are the customers. So what I think and what's the product like medicine,

3:00:40.640 --> 3:00:46.320
 education, academia, military, etc. That's part of the hidden motives analysis. Often people

3:00:46.320 --> 3:00:49.840
 have a thing they say about what the product is and who the customer is. And maybe you need to

3:00:49.840 --> 3:00:56.640
 dig a little deeper to find out what's really going on or a lot deeper. You've written that you

3:00:56.640 --> 3:01:04.160
 seek out quote view quakes. You're able as a as an intelligent black box word generating machine,

3:01:04.160 --> 3:01:08.080
 you're able to generate a lot of sexy words. I like it. I love it. View quakes,

3:01:08.880 --> 3:01:16.560
 which are insights which dramatically changed my worldview, your worldview. You write,

3:01:16.560 --> 3:01:22.000
 I loved science fiction as a child studied physics and artificial intelligence for a long time each

3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:28.080
 and now study economics and political science, all fields full of such insights.

3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:35.200
 So let me ask, what are some view quakes or a beautiful surprising idea to you from each of

3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:40.560
 those fields? Physics, AI, economics, political science. I know it's a tough question. Something

3:01:40.560 --> 3:01:44.800
 that springs to mind about physics, for example, that just is beautiful. I mean, right from the

3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:50.720
 beginning, say, special relativity was a big surprise. You know, most of us have a simple

3:01:50.720 --> 3:01:54.240
 concept of time and it seems perfectly adequate for everything we've ever seen.

3:01:54.880 --> 3:01:59.440
 And to have it explained to you that you need to sort of have a mixture concept of time and space

3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:04.400
 where you put it into the space time construct, how it looks different from different perspectives,

3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:10.960
 that was quite a shock. And that was such a shock that it makes you think, what else do I know that

3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:16.480
 isn't the way it seems? Certainly, quantum mechanics is certainly another enormous shock in

3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:20.880
 terms of from your point, you have this idea that there's a space and then there's

3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:28.800
 particles at points and maybe fields in between. And quantum mechanics is just a whole different

3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:32.880
 representation. It looks nothing like what you would have thought as sort of the basic

3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:36.720
 representation of the physical world. And that was quite a surprise.

3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:42.960
 What would you say is the catalyst for the view quake in theoretical physics in the 20th century?

3:02:42.960 --> 3:02:46.880
 Where does that come from? So the interesting thing about Einstein, it seems like a lot of that

3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:51.520
 came from like almost thought experiments. It wasn't almost experimentally driven.

3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:59.840
 And with, actually, I don't know the full story of quantum mechanics, how much of it is experiment,

3:02:59.840 --> 3:03:06.560
 like where, if you look at the full trace of idea generation there, of all the weird stuff

3:03:06.560 --> 3:03:11.120
 that falls out of quantum mechanics, how much of that was the experimentalist, how much was

3:03:11.120 --> 3:03:16.160
 the theoreticians? But usually, in theoretical physics, the theories lead the way. So maybe,

3:03:16.160 --> 3:03:21.600
 can you elucidate? What is the catalyst for these?

3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:27.440
 CB – The remarkable thing about physics and about many other areas of academic intellectual

3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:34.240
 life is that it just seems way over determined. That is, if it hadn't been for Einstein or if

3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:39.440
 it hadn't been for Heisenberg, certainly within a half a century, somebody else would have come up

3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:43.120
 with essentially the same things. CB – Is there something you believe?

3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:43.920
 CB – Yes. CB – Or is there something?

3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:48.000
 CB – Yes. So I think when you look at sort of just the history of physics and the history of

3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:53.280
 other areas, some areas like that, there's just this enormous convergence that the different

3:03:53.280 --> 3:03:58.960
 kind of evidence that was being collected was so redundant in the sense that so many different

3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:04.960
 things revealed the same things that eventually you just kind of have to accept it because it just

3:04:04.960 --> 3:04:11.600
 gets obvious. So if you look at the details, of course, Einstein did it for somebody else,

3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:17.120
 and it's well worth celebrating Einstein for that. And we, by celebrating the particular

3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:21.680
 people who did something first or came across something first, we are encouraging all the rest

3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:31.120
 to move a little faster, to push us all a little faster, which is great. But I still think we would

3:04:31.120 --> 3:04:36.960
 have gotten roughly to the same place within a half century. So sometimes people are special

3:04:36.960 --> 3:04:41.120
 because of how much longer it would have taken. So some people say general relativity would have

3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:45.920
 taken longer without Einstein than other things. I mean, Heisenberg quantum mechanics, I mean,

3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:49.440
 there were several different formulations of quantum mechanics all around the same few years,

3:04:50.240 --> 3:04:54.480
 means no one of them made that much of a difference. We would have had pretty much the same thing,

3:04:54.480 --> 3:04:59.920
 regardless of which of them did it exactly when. Nevertheless, I'm happy to celebrate them all.

3:04:59.920 --> 3:05:03.760
 But this is a choice I make in my research, that is when there's an area where there's lots of

3:05:03.760 --> 3:05:09.840
 people working together who are sort of scoping each other and getting a result just before

3:05:09.840 --> 3:05:14.320
 somebody else does, you ask, well, how much of a difference would I make there? At most,

3:05:14.320 --> 3:05:19.520
 I could make something happen a few months before somebody else. And so I'm less worried about

3:05:19.520 --> 3:05:23.360
 them missing things. So when I'm trying to help the world like doing research, I'm looking for

3:05:23.360 --> 3:05:27.040
 neglected things. I'm looking for things that nobody's doing it. If I didn't do it, nobody

3:05:27.040 --> 3:05:30.880
 would do it. Nobody would do it. Or at least for a long time. In the next 10, 20 years kind of

3:05:30.880 --> 3:05:35.440
 things. Exactly. Same with general relativity, just, you know, who would do it. It might take

3:05:35.440 --> 3:05:39.680
 another 10, 20, 30, 50 years. So that's the place where you can have the biggest impact,

3:05:39.680 --> 3:05:44.720
 is finding the things that nobody would do unless you did them. And then that's when you get the

3:05:44.720 --> 3:05:52.560
 big view quake, the insight. So what about artificial intelligence? Would it be the EMs,

3:05:52.560 --> 3:06:03.360
 the emulated minds? What idea, whether that struck you in the shower one day, or are you just

3:06:03.360 --> 3:06:08.800
 clearly the biggest view quake in artificial intelligence is the realization of just how

3:06:08.800 --> 3:06:14.640
 complicated our human minds are. So most people who come to artificial intelligence from other

3:06:14.640 --> 3:06:20.080
 fields or from relative ignorance, a very common phenomenon, which you must be familiar with,

3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:25.360
 is that they come up with some concept, and then they think that must be it. Once we implement

3:06:25.360 --> 3:06:29.600
 this new concept, we will have it. We will have full human level or higher artificial

3:06:29.600 --> 3:06:34.080
 intelligence, right? And they're just not appreciating just how big the problem is,

3:06:34.080 --> 3:06:38.640
 how long the road is, just how much is involved. Because that's actually hard to appreciate.

3:06:38.640 --> 3:06:43.920
 When we just think, it seems really simple. And studying artificial intelligence, going

3:06:43.920 --> 3:06:47.440
 through many particular problems, looking at each problem, all the different things you need

3:06:47.440 --> 3:06:51.760
 to be able to do to solve a problem like that, makes you realize all the things your minds are

3:06:51.760 --> 3:06:57.440
 doing that you are not aware of. That's that vast subconscious that you're not aware of.

3:06:57.440 --> 3:07:01.360
 That's the biggest view cave from artificial intelligence. By far, for most people who study

3:07:01.360 --> 3:07:07.680
 artificial intelligence, is to see just how hard it is. I think that's a good point. But I think

3:07:07.680 --> 3:07:18.000
 it's a very early view quake. It's when the Dunning Kruger crashes hard. It's the first

3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:22.640
 realization that humans are actually quite incredible. The human mind, the human body is

3:07:22.640 --> 3:07:28.960
 quite incredible. There's a lot of different parts to it. But then, see, it's already been so long

3:07:28.960 --> 3:07:34.480
 for me that I've experienced that view quake, that for me, I now experience the view quakes of,

3:07:34.480 --> 3:07:39.760
 holy shit, this little thing is actually quite powerful. Like neural networks, I'm amazed.

3:07:39.760 --> 3:07:47.840
 Because you've become almost cynical after that first view quake of like, this is so hard.

3:07:47.840 --> 3:07:53.840
 Like evolution did some incredible work to create the human mind. But then you realize,

3:07:53.840 --> 3:07:59.200
 just like you have, you've talked about a bunch of simple models, that simple things can actually

3:07:59.200 --> 3:08:05.840
 be extremely powerful, that maybe emulating of the human mind is extremely difficult,

3:08:05.840 --> 3:08:10.400
 but you can go a long way with a large neural network. You can go a long way with a dumb

3:08:10.400 --> 3:08:15.680
 solution. It's that Stuart Russell thing with the reinforcement learning. Holy crap. You can do,

3:08:15.680 --> 3:08:18.960
 you can go quite a long way with a simple thing. But we still have a very long road to go.

3:08:18.960 --> 3:08:29.680
 Well, I can't. I refuse to sort of know. The road is full of surprises. So long is an interesting,

3:08:29.680 --> 3:08:35.120
 like you said, with the six hard steps that humans have to take to arrive at where we are

3:08:35.120 --> 3:08:42.240
 from the origin of life on earth. So it's long maybe in the statistical improbability of the

3:08:42.240 --> 3:08:47.200
 steps that have to be taken. But in terms of how quickly those steps could be taken,

3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:54.080
 I don't know if my intuition says it's, if it's hundreds of years away or if it's

3:08:55.680 --> 3:09:01.280
 a couple of years away, I prefer to measure pretty confidence at least a decade. And

3:09:01.280 --> 3:09:04.800
 well, we can find the confidence at least three decades. I can steal man either direction.

3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:10.480
 I prefer to measure that journey in the Elon Musk's. That's the new, we don't get Elon Musk

3:09:10.480 --> 3:09:15.520
 very often. So that's, that's a long time scale. For now, I don't know, maybe you can clone or

3:09:15.520 --> 3:09:21.280
 maybe multiply or even know what Elon Musk, what that is, what is that? What is that? That's a good

3:09:21.280 --> 3:09:26.480
 question. Exactly. Well, that's an excellent question. How does that fit into the models of

3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:34.160
 three parameters that are required for becoming a grabby alien civilization? That's the question

3:09:34.160 --> 3:09:40.240
 of how much any individual makes in the long path of civilization over time. Yes. And it's a favorite

3:09:40.240 --> 3:09:44.960
 topic of historians and people to try to focus on individuals and how much of a difference they

3:09:44.960 --> 3:09:49.120
 make. And certainly some individuals make a substantial difference in the modest term,

3:09:49.760 --> 3:09:54.640
 right? Like, you know, certainly without Hitler being Hitler in the role he took,

3:09:55.280 --> 3:10:00.240
 European history would have taken a different path for a while there. But if we're looking over

3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:05.520
 like many centuries longer term things, most individuals do fade in their individual influence.

3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:16.880
 So, no matter how sexy your hair is, you will also be forgotten in long arc of history.

3:10:17.520 --> 3:10:23.600
 So you said at least 10 years. So let's talk a little bit about this AI point

3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:30.800
 of where, how we achieve, how hard is the problem of solving intelligence

3:10:30.800 --> 3:10:39.120
 by engineering artificial intelligence that achieves human level, human like

3:10:39.120 --> 3:10:42.640
 qualities that we associate with intelligence? How hard is this? What are the different

3:10:42.640 --> 3:10:48.720
 trajectories that take us there? One way to think about it is in terms of the scope of

3:10:48.720 --> 3:10:53.440
 the technology space you're talking about. So let's take the biggest possible scope,

3:10:53.440 --> 3:11:00.880
 all of human technology, right? The entire human economy. So the entire economy is composed of

3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:05.440
 many industries, each of which have many products with many different technologies supporting each

3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:14.480
 one. At that scale, I think we can accept that most innovations are a small fraction of the total

3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:22.000
 that is usually has relatively gradual overall progress. And that individual innovations that

3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:26.560
 are have a substantial effect that the total are rare and their total effect is still a small

3:11:26.560 --> 3:11:32.160
 percentage of the total economy, right? There's very few individual innovations that made a

3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:35.360
 substantial difference to the whole economy, right? What are we talking? Steam engine,

3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:42.400
 shipping containers, a few things. Shipping containers deserves to be up there with steam

3:11:42.400 --> 3:11:49.680
 engines, honestly. Can you say exactly what shipping containers revolutionized shipping?

3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:56.160
 Shipping is very important. But placing that at shipping containers. So you're saying you wouldn't

3:11:56.160 --> 3:12:00.720
 have some of the magic of the supply chain, all that without shipping containers?

3:12:00.720 --> 3:12:03.760
 Made a big difference, absolutely. Interesting. That's something we're looking at.

3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:10.400
 We shouldn't take that tangent all the time to do. But anyway, so there's a few, just a few

3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:15.920
 innovations. So at the scale of the whole economy, right? Now, as you move down to a much smaller

3:12:15.920 --> 3:12:22.560
 scale, you will see individual innovations having a bigger effect, right? So if you look at, I don't

3:12:22.560 --> 3:12:26.720
 know, lawn mowers or something, I don't know about the innovations lawn mower, but there are probably

3:12:26.720 --> 3:12:31.920
 like steps where you just had a new kind of lawn mower and that made a big difference to mowing

3:12:31.920 --> 3:12:38.240
 lawns because you're focusing on a smaller part of the whole technology space, right? So,

3:12:39.680 --> 3:12:43.760
 and you know, sometimes like military technology, there's a lot of military technologies,

3:12:43.760 --> 3:12:47.520
 a lot of small ones, but every once in a while, a particular military weapon like makes a big

3:12:47.520 --> 3:12:54.320
 difference. But still, even so, mostly overall, they're making modest differences to a something

3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:57.920
 that's increasing relatively, say like US military is the strongest in the world.

3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:04.320
 Consistently for a while, no one weapon in the last 70 years has like made a big difference in

3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:08.240
 terms of the overall prominence of the US military, right? Because that's just saying,

3:13:08.240 --> 3:13:13.200
 even though every once in a while, even the recent Soviet hyper missiles or whatever they are,

3:13:13.200 --> 3:13:16.720
 they aren't changing the overall balance dramatically, right?

3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:25.440
 So when we get to AI, now that now I can frame the question, how big is AI? Basically, if so,

3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:29.680
 one way of thinking about AI is it's just all mental tasks. And then you ask what fraction

3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:36.880
 of tasks are mental tasks? And then I go a lot. And then if I think of AI is like half of everything,

3:13:38.160 --> 3:13:42.560
 then I think, well, it's got to be composed of lots of parts where anyone innovation is

3:13:42.560 --> 3:13:50.240
 only a small impact, right? Now, if you think, no, no, no, AI is like AGI. And then you think

3:13:51.200 --> 3:13:56.080
 AGI is a small thing, right? There's only a small number of key innovations that will enable it.

3:13:56.640 --> 3:14:01.920
 Now you're thinking there could be a bigger chunk that you might find that would have a

3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:07.120
 bigger impact. So the way I would ask you to frame these things in terms of the chunkiness

3:14:07.120 --> 3:14:13.360
 of different areas of technology, in terms of how big they are, if you take 10 chunky areas

3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:18.560
 and you add them together, the total is less chunky. Yeah. But don't you, are you able until

3:14:18.560 --> 3:14:24.320
 you solve the fundamental core parts of the problem to estimate the chunkiness of that problem?

3:14:25.360 --> 3:14:29.920
 Well, if you have a history of prior chunkiness, that could be your best estimate for future

3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:34.000
 chunkiness. So for example, I mean, even at the level of the world economy, right,

3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:39.040
 we've had this, what, 10,000 years of civilization, well, that's only a short time,

3:14:39.040 --> 3:14:44.960
 you might say, oh, that doesn't predict future chunkiness. But it looks relatively steady and

3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:50.720
 consistent. We can say even in computer science, we've had seven years of computer science,

3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:55.920
 we have enough data to look at chunkiness of computer science. Like, when were there algorithms

3:14:55.920 --> 3:15:03.600
 or approaches that made a big chunky difference and how large a fraction of those that was that?

3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:07.760
 And I'd say mostly in computer science, most innovation has been relatively small chunks,

3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:12.800
 the bigger chunks have been rare. Well, this is the interesting thing. This is about AI and just

3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:22.560
 algorithms in general is, you know, PageRank. So Google's, right? So sometimes it's a simple

3:15:22.560 --> 3:15:30.800
 algorithm that by itself is not that useful, but the scale of context and in the context that's

3:15:30.800 --> 3:15:36.720
 scalable, yeah, depending on the context, all of a sudden the power is revealed. And there's

3:15:36.720 --> 3:15:43.760
 something, I guess that's the nature of chunkiness is that you get things that can reach a lot of

3:15:43.760 --> 3:15:48.960
 people simply can be quite chunky. So one standard story about algorithms is to say

3:15:49.600 --> 3:15:56.720
 algorithms have a fixed cost plus a marginal cost. And so in history, when you had computers

3:15:56.720 --> 3:16:02.560
 that were very small, you tried all the algorithms that had low fixed costs. And you look for the

3:16:02.560 --> 3:16:06.960
 best of those. But over time, as computers got bigger, you could afford to do larger fixed costs

3:16:06.960 --> 3:16:11.680
 and try those. And some of those had more effective algorithms in terms of their marginal cost.

3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:17.440
 And that, in fact, you know, that roughly explains the long term history where, in fact,

3:16:17.440 --> 3:16:20.800
 the rate of algorithmic improvement is about the same as the rate of hardware improvement,

3:16:20.800 --> 3:16:27.040
 which is a remarkable coincidence. But it would be explained by saying, well,

3:16:27.040 --> 3:16:31.360
 there's all these better algorithms you can't try until you have a big enough computer to pay

3:16:31.360 --> 3:16:36.400
 the fixed cost of doing some trials to find out if that algorithm actually saves you on the marginal

3:16:36.400 --> 3:16:42.000
 cost. And so that's an explanation for this relatively continuous history where, so we

3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:45.200
 have a good story about why hardware is so continuous, right? And you might think, why

3:16:45.200 --> 3:16:49.920
 would software be so continuous with the hardware? But if there's a distribution of algorithms in

3:16:49.920 --> 3:16:55.120
 terms of their fixed costs, and it's, say, spread out at a wide log normal distribution,

3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:59.680
 then we could be sort of marching through that log normal distribution, trying out algorithms

3:16:59.680 --> 3:17:03.200
 with larger fixed costs and finding the ones that have lower marginal costs.

3:17:04.240 --> 3:17:19.600
 So would you say AGI, human level AI, even EM, emulated mines, is chunky? Like a few breakthroughs

3:17:19.600 --> 3:17:25.440
 can take this. So an M is by its nature chunky in the sense that if you have an emulated brain

3:17:25.440 --> 3:17:32.640
 and you're 25% effective at emulating it, that's crap. That's nothing. Okay. Okay. You pretty much

3:17:32.640 --> 3:17:38.640
 need to emulate a full human brain. Is that obvious? Is that obvious? It's pretty obvious.

3:17:38.640 --> 3:17:43.440
 I'm talking about like, you know, so the key thing is you're emulating various brain cells,

3:17:43.440 --> 3:17:48.000
 and so you have to emulate the input output pattern of those cells. So if you get that pattern

3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:52.720
 somewhat close, but not close enough, then the whole system just doesn't have the overall

3:17:52.720 --> 3:17:57.920
 behavior you're looking for, right? But it could have functionally some of the power of the overall

3:17:57.920 --> 3:18:01.600
 system. So there'd be some threshold. The point is when you get close enough, then it goes over

3:18:01.600 --> 3:18:06.560
 the threshold. It's like taking a computer chip and deleting every one percent of the gates, right?

3:18:07.120 --> 3:18:13.200
 No, that's very chunky. But the hope is that the emulating the human brain, I mean, the human

3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:17.680
 brain itself is not. Right. So it has a certain level of redundancy and a certain level of robustness.

3:18:17.680 --> 3:18:20.960
 And so there's some threshold when you get close to that level of redundancy and robustness,

3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:25.440
 then it starts to work. But until you get to that level, it's just going to be crap, right?

3:18:25.440 --> 3:18:30.080
 It's going to be just a big thing that isn't working for us. So we can be pretty sure that

3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:35.920
 emulations is a big chunk in an economic sense, right? At some point, you'll be able to make one

3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:41.600
 that's actually effective in enable substituting for humans. And then that will be this huge

3:18:41.600 --> 3:18:44.640
 economic product that people will try to buy crazy. Now,

3:18:44.640 --> 3:18:48.880
 you'll bring a lot of out of people's lives so they'll be willing to pay for it.

3:18:48.880 --> 3:18:54.480
 But it could be that the first emulation costs a billion dollars each, right? And then we have

3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:57.920
 them, but we can't really use them. They're too expensive. And then the cost slowly comes down.

3:18:57.920 --> 3:19:04.880
 And now we have less of a chunky adoption, right? That as the cost comes down, then we use more

3:19:04.880 --> 3:19:11.520
 and more of them in more and more contexts. And that's a more continuous curve. So it's only if

3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:16.720
 the first emulations are relatively cheap that you get a more sudden disruption to society.

3:19:17.760 --> 3:19:21.760
 And that could happen if the algorithm is the last thing you figure out how to do or something.

3:19:21.760 --> 3:19:29.440
 What about robots that capture some magic in terms of social connection? Robots,

3:19:29.440 --> 3:19:36.000
 like we have a robot dog on the carpet right there. Robots that are able to capture some magic

3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:42.320
 of human connection as they interact with humans, but are not emulating the brain. What about

3:19:43.200 --> 3:19:49.840
 those? How far away? So we're thinking about chunkiness or distance now. So if you ask how

3:19:49.840 --> 3:19:58.400
 chunky is the task of making a emulatable robot or something, which chunkiness and time are

3:19:58.400 --> 3:20:03.280
 correlated. Right. But it's about how far away it is or how suddenly it would happen.

3:20:03.280 --> 3:20:09.440
 And chunkiness is how suddenly and difficulty is just how far away it is. But it could be a

3:20:09.440 --> 3:20:12.960
 continuous difficulty. It could just be far away, but we'll slowly, steadily get there.

3:20:12.960 --> 3:20:16.800
 Or there could be these thresholds where we reach a threshold and suddenly we can do a lot better.

3:20:16.800 --> 3:20:22.400
 Yeah. That's a good question for both. I tend to believe that all of it, not just the M,

3:20:23.120 --> 3:20:31.680
 but AGI2 is chunky. And human level intelligence embodied in robots is also chunky.

3:20:31.680 --> 3:20:36.400
 The history of computer science and chunkiness so far seems to be my rough best guess for the

3:20:36.400 --> 3:20:44.880
 chunkiness of AGI. It is chunky. It's modestly chunky, not that chunky. Our ability to use

3:20:44.880 --> 3:20:49.120
 computers to do many things in the economy has been moving relatively steadily. Overall,

3:20:49.120 --> 3:20:55.040
 in terms of our use of computers in society, they have been relatively steadily improving for 70

3:20:55.040 --> 3:21:00.640
 years. No, but I would say that's hard. Okay. I would have to really think about that because

3:21:00.640 --> 3:21:05.680
 neural networks are quite surprising. Sure. But every once in a while, we have a new thing that's

3:21:05.680 --> 3:21:10.240
 surprising. But if you stand back, we see something like that every 10 years or so,

3:21:10.240 --> 3:21:16.560
 some new innovation that has a big effect. So, modestly chunky.

3:21:19.280 --> 3:21:23.200
 Yeah. The history of the level of disruption we've seen in the past would be a rough estimate of

3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:27.440
 the level of disruption in the future, unless the future is, we're going to hit a chunky territory

3:21:27.440 --> 3:21:35.120
 much chunkier than we've seen in the past. Well, I do think it's like Kunian, revolution type.

3:21:36.640 --> 3:21:46.560
 It seems like the data, especially on AI, is difficult to reason with because it's so recent,

3:21:46.560 --> 3:21:53.440
 it's such a recent field. AI's been around for 50 years. I mean, 50, 60, 70, 80 years being recent.

3:21:53.440 --> 3:21:57.520
 Okay. It's enough time to see a lot of trends.

3:21:58.720 --> 3:22:06.880
 A few trends. I think the internet computing, there's really a lot of interesting stuff

3:22:06.880 --> 3:22:14.080
 that's happened over the past 30 years that I think the possibility of revolutions is

3:22:14.080 --> 3:22:19.200
 likelier than it was in the... I think for the last 70 years, there have always been a lot of

3:22:19.200 --> 3:22:23.040
 things that look like that have a potential for revolution. So, we can't reason well about this.

3:22:23.040 --> 3:22:27.760
 I mean, we can reason well by looking at the past trends. I would say the past trend is roughly

3:22:27.760 --> 3:22:32.800
 your best guess for the future of this... No, but if I look back at the things that might have

3:22:32.800 --> 3:22:40.240
 looked like revolutions in the 70s and 80s and 90s, they are less like the revolutions of

3:22:40.240 --> 3:22:45.440
 that appear to be happening now or the capacity of revolutions that appear to be there now.

3:22:45.440 --> 3:22:50.720
 First of all, there's a lot of more money to be made. So, there's a lot more incentive for markets

3:22:50.720 --> 3:22:56.480
 to do a lot of kind of innovation. It seems like in the AI space. But then again, there's a history

3:22:56.480 --> 3:23:00.960
 of winters and summers and so on. So, maybe we're just like riding a nice wave right now.

3:23:00.960 --> 3:23:05.760
 One of the biggest issues is the difference between impressive demos and commercial value.

3:23:05.760 --> 3:23:10.160
 Yes. So, we often, through the history of AI, we saw very impressive demos

3:23:10.160 --> 3:23:14.880
 that never really translated much into commercial value. So, somebody who works on and cares about

3:23:14.880 --> 3:23:20.960
 autonomous and semi autonomous vehicles, tell me about it. And there again, we return to the

3:23:20.960 --> 3:23:28.720
 number of Elon Musk's per earth per year generated. That's the M. Coincidentally,

3:23:28.720 --> 3:23:35.120
 same initials as the M. Very suspicious. We're going to have to look into that.

3:23:35.120 --> 3:23:41.520
 All right. Two more fields that I would like to force and twist your arm to look for view

3:23:41.520 --> 3:23:49.600
 quakes and for beautiful ideas, economics. What is a beautiful idea to you about economics?

3:23:51.440 --> 3:23:56.960
 You've mentioned a lot of them. Sure. So, as you said before, there's going to be the first

3:23:56.960 --> 3:24:00.880
 view cake most people encounter that makes the biggest difference on average in the world,

3:24:00.880 --> 3:24:05.360
 because that's the only thing most people ever see is the first one. And so,

3:24:05.360 --> 3:24:11.600
 you know, with AI, the first one is just how big the problem is. But once you get past that,

3:24:11.600 --> 3:24:16.960
 you'll find out there's certainly for economics, the first one is just the power of markets.

3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:23.120
 You might have thought it was just really hard to figure out how to optimize in a big

3:24:23.120 --> 3:24:29.280
 complicated space and markets just do a good first pass for an awful lot of stuff. And they

3:24:29.280 --> 3:24:35.840
 are really quite robust and powerful. And that's just quite the view crank where you just say,

3:24:35.840 --> 3:24:41.760
 you know, just let up. If you want to get in the ballpark, just let a market handle it and step

3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:47.680
 back. And that's true for a wide range of things. It's not true for everything, but it's a very

3:24:47.680 --> 3:24:51.360
 good first approximation. Most people's intuitions for how they should limit markets

3:24:51.360 --> 3:24:55.840
 are actually messing them up. They're that good in sense, right? Most people, when you go,

3:24:55.840 --> 3:25:01.680
 I don't know if we want to trust that. Well, you should be trusting that. What are markets?

3:25:03.040 --> 3:25:11.040
 Just a couple of words. So the idea is if people want something, then let other companies form

3:25:11.040 --> 3:25:15.840
 to try to supply that thing. Let those people pay for their cost of whatever they're making and try

3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:21.120
 to offer that product to those people. Let many people, many such firms enter that industry

3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:24.720
 and let the customers decide which ones they want. And if the firm goes out of business,

3:25:24.720 --> 3:25:29.040
 let it go bankrupt and let other people invest in whichever ventures they want to try to try

3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:33.120
 to attract customers to their version of the product. And that just works for a wide range

3:25:33.120 --> 3:25:37.120
 of products and services. And through all of this, there's a free exchange of information too.

3:25:37.760 --> 3:25:41.040
 There's a hope that there's no manipulation of information and so on.

3:25:43.360 --> 3:25:48.240
 Even when those things happen, still just the simple market solution is usually better than

3:25:48.240 --> 3:25:53.680
 the things you'll try to do to fix it. Then the alternative. That's a view crank,

3:25:53.680 --> 3:25:56.960
 it's surprising. It's not what you would initially thought.

3:25:56.960 --> 3:26:02.720
 That's one of the great, I guess, inventions of human civilization that trust the markets.

3:26:04.240 --> 3:26:07.840
 Now, another view kick that I learned in my research that's not all of economics,

3:26:07.840 --> 3:26:12.960
 but something more specialized is the rationality of disagreement. That is,

3:26:12.960 --> 3:26:18.240
 basically people who are trying to believe what's true in a complicated situation would not actually

3:26:18.240 --> 3:26:23.840
 disagree. And of course, humans disagree all the time. So it was quite the striking fact for

3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:28.480
 me to learn in grad school that actually rational agents would not knowingly disagree.

3:26:29.920 --> 3:26:34.880
 And so that makes disagreement more puzzling and it makes you less willing to disagree.

3:26:37.520 --> 3:26:41.360
 Humans are to some degree rational and are able to...

3:26:41.360 --> 3:26:49.600
 Their priorities are different than just figuring out the truth, which might not be

3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:54.320
 the same as being irrational. That's another tangent that could take an hour.

3:26:56.480 --> 3:27:03.280
 In the space of human affairs, political science, what is a beautiful, foundational,

3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:08.160
 interesting idea to you, a view quake in the space of political science?

3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:17.360
 The main thing that goes wrong in politics is people not agreeing on what the best thing to do

3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:22.800
 is. That's a wrong thing. So that's what goes wrong. That is, when you say what's

3:27:22.800 --> 3:27:28.160
 fundamental behind most political failures, it's that people are ignorant of what the

3:27:28.160 --> 3:27:33.920
 consequences of policy is. And that's surprising because it's actually feasible to solve that

3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:41.600
 problem, which we aren't solving. So it's a bug, not a feature that there's an inability to arrive

3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:47.200
 at a consensus. So most political systems, if everybody looked to some authority, say, on a

3:27:47.200 --> 3:27:51.280
 question and that authority told them the answer, then most political systems are capable of just

3:27:51.280 --> 3:28:00.800
 doing that thing. And so it's the failure to have trust for the authorities that is sort of the

3:28:00.800 --> 3:28:08.240
 underlying failure behind most political failure. We invade Iraq, say, when we don't have an

3:28:08.240 --> 3:28:14.560
 authority to tell us that's a really stupid thing to do. And it is possible to create

3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:20.240
 more informative trust for the authorities. That's a remarkable fact about the world of

3:28:21.280 --> 3:28:23.600
 institutions that we could do that, but we aren't.

3:28:24.640 --> 3:28:28.000
 Yeah. So that's surprising. We could and we aren't.

3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:31.920
 Right. Another big view correct about politics is from the Elf in the Brain that most people,

3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:35.760
 when they're interacting with politics, they say they want to make the world better,

3:28:35.760 --> 3:28:38.560
 they make their city better, their country better, and that's not their priority.

3:28:39.280 --> 3:28:44.000
 What is it? They want to show loyalty to their allies. They want to show their people they're

3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:49.520
 on their side. Yes. They're various tribes they're in. That's their primary priority,

3:28:49.520 --> 3:28:55.120
 and they do accomplish that. Yeah. And the tribes are usually color coded conveniently enough.

3:28:55.120 --> 3:29:00.320
 What would you say, you know, it's the Churchill question.

3:29:01.600 --> 3:29:05.440
 Democracy is the crappiest form of government, but it's the best one we got.

3:29:06.560 --> 3:29:13.760
 What's the best form of government for this, our 7 billion human civilization and the,

3:29:13.760 --> 3:29:18.080
 maybe as we get farther and farther, you mentioned a lot of stuff that's fascinating

3:29:18.080 --> 3:29:24.160
 about human history as we become more forager like and looking out beyond what's the best

3:29:24.160 --> 3:29:28.400
 form of government in the next 50, 100 years as we become a multi planetary species.

3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:36.160
 So the key failing is that we have existing political institutions and related institutions

3:29:36.160 --> 3:29:41.760
 like media institutions and other authority institutions, and these institutions sit in

3:29:41.760 --> 3:29:46.400
 a vast space of possible institutions. And the key failing we're just not exploring that space.

3:29:47.520 --> 3:29:52.400
 So I have made my proposals in that space, and I think I can identify many provinces

3:29:52.400 --> 3:29:56.960
 solutions. And many other people have made many other promising proposals in that space.

3:29:56.960 --> 3:30:00.640
 But the key thing is we're just not pursuing those proposals. We're not trying them out on

3:30:00.640 --> 3:30:05.200
 small scales. We're not doing tests. We're not exploring the space of these options.

3:30:05.760 --> 3:30:11.600
 That is the key thing we're failing to do. And if we did that, I am confident we would find much

3:30:11.600 --> 3:30:15.600
 better institutions than when we're using now, but we would have to actually try.

3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:23.040
 So there's a lot of those topics. I do hope we get a chance to talk again. You're a fascinating

3:30:23.040 --> 3:30:28.320
 human being. So I'm skipping a lot of tangents on purpose that I would love to take. You're such

3:30:28.320 --> 3:30:39.760
 a brilliant person with so many different topics. Let me take a stroll into the deep human psyche

3:30:39.760 --> 3:30:49.760
 of Robin Hansen himself. So first, may not be that deep. I might just be all on the surface.

3:30:49.760 --> 3:30:52.400
 What you see, what you get, there might not be much hiding behind it.

3:30:52.400 --> 3:30:59.840
 Some of the fun is on the surface. I actually think this is true of many of the most successful,

3:30:59.840 --> 3:31:05.120
 most interesting people you see in the world. That is, they have put so much effort into the

3:31:05.120 --> 3:31:10.240
 surface that they've constructed. And that's where they put all their energy. So somebody

3:31:10.240 --> 3:31:14.640
 might be a statesman or an actor or something else. And people want to interview them and they

3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:18.640
 want to say, what are you behind the scenes? What do you do in your free time? Those people

3:31:18.640 --> 3:31:23.040
 don't have free time. They don't have another life behind the scenes. They put all their energy

3:31:23.040 --> 3:31:28.240
 into that surface, the one we admire, the one we're fascinated by. And they kind of have to

3:31:28.240 --> 3:31:32.720
 make up the stuff behind the scenes to supply it for you. But it's not really there.

3:31:32.720 --> 3:31:36.240
 Well, there's several ways of phrasing this. One of it is authenticity, which is

3:31:38.640 --> 3:31:44.800
 if you become the thing you are on the surface, if the depths mirror the surface,

3:31:45.440 --> 3:31:50.880
 then that's what authenticity is. You're not concealing something. To push back on the idea

3:31:50.880 --> 3:31:57.680
 of actors, they actually have often a manufactured surface that they put on and they try on different

3:31:57.680 --> 3:32:03.040
 masks. And the depths are very different from the surface. And that's actually what makes them very

3:32:03.040 --> 3:32:12.720
 not interesting to interview. If you're an actor who actually lives the role that you play. So

3:32:12.720 --> 3:32:17.440
 like, I don't know, a Clint Eastwood type character who clearly represents the cowboy.

3:32:18.480 --> 3:32:24.400
 Like at least rhymes or echoes the person you play on the surface. That's authenticity.

3:32:24.400 --> 3:32:28.880
 Some people are typecasts and they have basically one persona. They play in all of their movies and

3:32:28.880 --> 3:32:35.040
 TV shows. And so those people, it probably is the actual persona that they are. Or it has become

3:32:35.040 --> 3:32:39.600
 that over time. Clint Eastwood would be one, I think of Tom Hanks as an ever, right? They just

3:32:39.600 --> 3:32:46.160
 always play the same person. And you and I are just both surface players. You're the fun, brilliant

3:32:46.160 --> 3:32:57.120
 thinker. And I am the suit wearing idiot full of silly questions. All right. That said,

3:32:59.200 --> 3:33:06.000
 let's put on your wise sage hat and ask you what advice would you give to young people today in

3:33:06.000 --> 3:33:14.320
 high school and college about life, about how to live a successful life in career or just in

3:33:14.320 --> 3:33:21.360
 general that they can be proud of? Most young people, when they actually ask you that question,

3:33:21.360 --> 3:33:27.520
 what they usually mean is, how can I be successful by usual standards? I'm not very good at giving

3:33:27.520 --> 3:33:34.880
 advice about that because that's not how I tried to live my life. So I would more flip it around and

3:33:34.880 --> 3:33:42.000
 say, you live in a rich society. You will have a long life. You have many resources available to you.

3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:49.760
 Whatever career you take, you'll have plenty of time to make progress on something else. Yes,

3:33:49.760 --> 3:33:54.240
 it might be better if you find a way to combine your career and your interests in a way that gives

3:33:54.240 --> 3:34:00.000
 you more time and energy, but there are often big compromises there as well. So if you have a passion

3:34:00.000 --> 3:34:05.520
 about some topic or something that you think is worth pursuing, you can just do it. You don't need

3:34:05.520 --> 3:34:12.400
 other people's approval and you can just start doing whatever it is you think it worth doing.

3:34:12.400 --> 3:34:16.800
 It might take you decades, but decades are enough to make enormous progress on most all

3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:21.280
 interesting things. And don't worry about the commitment of it. I mean, that's a lot of what

3:34:21.280 --> 3:34:26.480
 people worry about is, well, there's so many options and if I choose a thing and I stick with it,

3:34:26.480 --> 3:34:32.240
 I sacrifice all the other paths I could have taken. So I switched my career at the age of 34

3:34:32.240 --> 3:34:36.480
 with two kids, age zero and two, went back to grad school in social science after being a

3:34:36.480 --> 3:34:43.520
 software, research software engineer. So it's quite possible to change your mind later in life.

3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:46.560
 How can you have an age of zero?

3:34:48.480 --> 3:34:49.040
 Less than one.

3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:55.040
 Okay. Oh, oh, you index was, I got it. Okay.

3:34:55.040 --> 3:35:01.120
 Right. Like people also ask what to read and I say textbooks. And until you've read lots of

3:35:01.120 --> 3:35:08.400
 textbooks or maybe review articles, I'm not so sure you should be reading blog posts and Twitter

3:35:08.400 --> 3:35:14.720
 feeds and even podcasts. I would say at the beginning read the read, this is our best,

3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:18.160
 humanity's best summary of how to learn things is crammed into textbooks.

3:35:18.160 --> 3:35:22.560
 Especially the ones on like introduction to biology.

3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:26.800
 Introduction to everything. Just read all the algorithms. Read as many textbooks as you

3:35:26.800 --> 3:35:31.120
 can stomach. And then maybe if you want to know more about a subject, find review articles.

3:35:31.120 --> 3:35:33.520
 You don't need to read the latest stuff for most topics.

3:35:33.520 --> 3:35:36.720
 Yeah. And actually textbooks often have the prettiest pictures.

3:35:37.280 --> 3:35:40.000
 There you go. And then depending on the field, if it's technical,

3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:44.000
 then doing the homework problems at the end, it's actually extremely, extremely useful.

3:35:44.800 --> 3:35:50.240
 Extremely powerful way to understand something if you allow it. I actually think of like high

3:35:50.240 --> 3:35:57.600
 school and college, which you kind of remind me of people don't often think of it that way, but you

3:35:57.600 --> 3:36:06.000
 will almost not again get an opportunity to spend a time with a fundamental subject and like

3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:10.080
 all the basics and everybody's forcing you like everybody wants you to do it.

3:36:11.120 --> 3:36:15.840
 And like you'll never get that chance again to sit there, even though it's outside of your

3:36:15.840 --> 3:36:23.920
 interest biology. Like in high school, I took AP biology, AP chemistry. I'm thinking of subjects

3:36:23.920 --> 3:36:31.520
 I never again really visited seriously. And it was so nice to be forced into anatomy and physiology,

3:36:32.080 --> 3:36:36.720
 to be forced into that world, to stay with it, to look at the pretty pictures,

3:36:36.720 --> 3:36:42.960
 to certain moments to actually for a moment, enjoy the beauty of these, of like how cell

3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:48.560
 works and all those kinds of things. And somehow that stays, like the ripples of that fascination

3:36:48.560 --> 3:36:56.880
 that stays with you, even if you never utilize those learnings in your actual work.

3:36:56.880 --> 3:37:00.400
 A common problem, at least of many young people I meet, is that they're

3:37:01.200 --> 3:37:08.960
 feeling idealistic and altruistic, but in a rush. So the usual human tradition that goes

3:37:08.960 --> 3:37:13.600
 back hundreds, thousands of years is that people's productivity rises with time and

3:37:13.600 --> 3:37:18.800
 maybe peaks around the age of 40 or 50. The age of 40, 50 is when you will be having the

3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:23.200
 highest income, you'll have the most contacts, you will sort of be wise about how the world works.

3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:31.280
 Expect to have your biggest impact then. Before then, you can have impacts, but you're also mainly

3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:38.320
 building up your resources and abilities. That's the usual human trajectory, expect that to be

3:37:38.320 --> 3:37:43.040
 true of you too. Don't be in such a rush to like accomplish enormous things at the age of 18 or

3:37:43.040 --> 3:37:47.600
 whatever. I mean, you might as well practice trying to do things, but that's mostly about

3:37:47.600 --> 3:37:50.880
 learning how to do things by practicing. There's a lot of things you can't do unless you just keep

3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:57.760
 trying them. And when all else fails, try to maximize the number of offspring however way you

3:37:57.760 --> 3:38:02.640
 can. That's certainly something I've neglected. I would tell my younger version of myself,

3:38:02.640 --> 3:38:10.160
 pay, try to have more descendants. Yes, absolutely. It matters more than I realized at the time.

3:38:11.840 --> 3:38:21.120
 Both in terms of making copies of yourself in mutated form and just the joy of raising them.

3:38:21.120 --> 3:38:29.520
 Sure. I mean, the meaning even. In the literature on the value people get out of life,

3:38:29.520 --> 3:38:34.160
 there's a key distinction between happiness and meaning. So happiness is how do you feel right

3:38:34.160 --> 3:38:42.000
 now about right now. And meaning is how do you feel about your whole life. And many things that

3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:45.840
 produce happiness don't produce meaning as reliably. And if you have to choose between them,

3:38:45.840 --> 3:38:53.920
 you'd rather have meaning. And meaning is more goes along with sacrificing happiness sometimes.

3:38:53.920 --> 3:38:58.800
 And children are an example of that. Do you get a lot more meaning out of children,

3:38:58.800 --> 3:39:06.640
 even if there are a lot more work? Why do you think kids, children are so magical,

3:39:07.360 --> 3:39:15.920
 like raising kids? Because I would love to have kids. And whenever I work with robots,

3:39:15.920 --> 3:39:20.720
 there's some of the same magic when there's an entity that comes to life. And in that case,

3:39:20.720 --> 3:39:28.400
 I'm not trying to draw too many parallels, but there's some echo to it, which is when you program

3:39:28.400 --> 3:39:34.560
 a robot, there's some aspect of your intellect that is now instilled in this other moving being

3:39:35.280 --> 3:39:40.800
 that's kind of magical. Or why do you think that's magical? And you said happiness and meaning

3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:45.920
 as opposed to a short. Meaningful. Why is it meaningful?

3:39:45.920 --> 3:39:51.840
 It's overdetermined. I can give you several different reasons, all of which is sufficient.

3:39:51.840 --> 3:39:54.640
 And so the question is, we don't know which ones are the correct reasons.

3:39:54.640 --> 3:39:57.840
 Such a technical, it's overdetermined. Look it up.

3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:02.800
 So I meet a lot of people interested in the future, interested in thinking about the future,

3:40:02.800 --> 3:40:08.400
 they're thinking about how can I influence the future? But overwhelmingly in history so far,

3:40:08.400 --> 3:40:11.200
 the main way people have influenced the future is by having children.

3:40:11.200 --> 3:40:19.040
 Overwhelmingly. And that's just not an incidental fact. You are built for that. That is,

3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:25.280
 you're the sequence of thousands of generations, each of which successfully had a descendant.

3:40:25.280 --> 3:40:32.000
 And that affected who you are. You just have to expect, and it's true that who you are is built

3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:38.880
 to be expected to have a child, to want to have a child, to have that be a natural and

3:40:38.880 --> 3:40:42.800
 meaningful interaction for you. And it's just true. It's just one of those things you just

3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:50.400
 should have expected. And it's not a surprise. Well, to push back in terms of influencing the

3:40:50.400 --> 3:40:56.720
 future as we get more and more technology, more and more of us are able to influence the future

3:40:56.720 --> 3:40:59.840
 in all kinds of other ways. Right. Being a teacher, educator.

3:40:59.840 --> 3:41:05.200
 Even so though, still most of our influence on the future has probably happened being kids,

3:41:05.200 --> 3:41:09.840
 even though we've accumulated more ways, other ways to do it. You mean at scale,

3:41:09.840 --> 3:41:14.880
 I guess the depth of influence, like really how much of much effort, how much of yourself

3:41:14.880 --> 3:41:22.000
 you really put another human being. Do you mean both the raising of a kid or you mean raw genetic

3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:27.840
 information? Well, both, but raw genetics is probably more than half of it. More than half.

3:41:27.840 --> 3:41:36.160
 More than half. Even in this modern world. Yep. Genetics. Let me ask some dark,

3:41:37.040 --> 3:41:44.560
 difficult questions if I might. Let's take a stroll into that place that may, may not exist

3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:51.680
 according to you. What's the darkest place you've ever gone to in your mind, in your life, a dark

3:41:51.680 --> 3:42:01.200
 time, a challenging time in your life that you had to overcome? You know, probably just feeling

3:42:01.200 --> 3:42:07.920
 strongly rejected. And so I've been, I'm apparently somewhat emotionally scarred by

3:42:07.920 --> 3:42:12.800
 just being very rejection averse, which must have happened because some rejections were just very

3:42:13.360 --> 3:42:19.760
 scarring. At a scale in what kinds of communities on the individual scale?

3:42:19.760 --> 3:42:24.480
 I mean, lots of different scales. Yeah. All the different, many different scales,

3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:33.040
 still that rejection stings. Hold on a second, but you're a contrarian thinker. You challenged

3:42:33.040 --> 3:42:43.840
 that knows why, if you were scarred by rejection, why welcome it in so many ways at a much larger

3:42:43.840 --> 3:42:50.640
 scale, constantly with your ideas. It could be that I'm just stupid or that I've just categorized

3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:57.520
 them differently than I should or something. You know, the most rejection that I've faced

3:42:57.520 --> 3:43:06.080
 hasn't been because of my intellectual ideas. So the intellectual ideas haven't been the thing

3:43:06.080 --> 3:43:14.560
 to risk the rejection. The one that the things that put challenge your mind taking you to a

3:43:14.560 --> 3:43:21.360
 dark place are the more psychological rejections. So you just asked me, what took me to a dark

3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:25.600
 place? You didn't specify it as sort of an intellectual dark place, I guess. Yeah, I just

3:43:25.600 --> 3:43:33.760
 meant like what? So intellectual is disjoint or at least at a more surface level than something

3:43:33.760 --> 3:43:39.520
 emotional. Yeah, I would just think there are times in your life when you're just in a dark

3:43:39.520 --> 3:43:45.520
 place and that can have many different causes. And most intellectuals are still just people

3:43:45.520 --> 3:43:49.200
 and most of the things that will affect them are the kinds of things that affect people.

3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:53.120
 They aren't that different necessarily. I mean, that's going to be true for like I presume most

3:43:53.120 --> 3:43:56.480
 basketball players are still just people. If you ask them what was the worst part of their life,

3:43:56.480 --> 3:44:00.080
 it's going to be this kind of thing that was the worst part of life for most people.

3:44:00.080 --> 3:44:06.400
 So rejection early in life? Yeah, I mean, not in grade school probably, but yeah,

3:44:06.400 --> 3:44:15.920
 sort of being a young, nerdy guy and feeling not in much demand or interest or later on

3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:24.560
 lots of different kinds of rejection. But yeah, most of us like to pretend we don't

3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:29.040
 that much need other people. We don't care what they think. It's a common sort of stance if somebody

3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:33.920
 rejects you or something. I didn't care about them anyway. But I think to be honest, people really

3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:39.440
 do care. Yeah, we do seek that connection, that love. What do you think is the role of love and

3:44:39.440 --> 3:44:53.200
 the human condition? Opacity in part. Love is one of those things where we know at some level

3:44:53.200 --> 3:44:59.120
 it's important to us, but it's not very clearly shown to us exactly how or why or in what ways.

3:45:00.320 --> 3:45:03.440
 There are some kinds of things we want where we can just clearly see that we want and why

3:45:03.440 --> 3:45:07.120
 that we want it right. We know when we're thirsty and we know why we were thirsty and we know what

3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:13.040
 to do about being thirsty and we know when it's over that we're no longer thirsty. Love isn't

3:45:13.040 --> 3:45:20.160
 like that. Like what do we seek from this? We're drawn to it, but we do not understand why we're

3:45:20.160 --> 3:45:25.520
 drawn exactly because it's not just affection. Because if it was just affection, we don't seem

3:45:25.520 --> 3:45:33.120
 to be drawn to pure affection. We don't seem to be drawn to somebody who's like a servant. We don't

3:45:33.120 --> 3:45:37.920
 seem to be necessarily drawn to somebody that satisfies all your needs or something like that.

3:45:39.120 --> 3:45:44.240
 So it's clearly something we want or need, but we're not exactly very clear about it. And that

3:45:44.240 --> 3:45:49.200
 is kind of important to it. So I've also noticed there are some kinds of things you can't imagine

3:45:49.200 --> 3:45:53.440
 very well. So if you imagine a situation, there are some aspects of the situation that you can

3:45:53.440 --> 3:45:58.560
 clearly imagine it being bright or dim. You can imagine it being windy or imagine being hot or

3:45:58.560 --> 3:46:03.840
 cold. But there are some aspects about your emotional stance in a situation that's actually

3:46:03.840 --> 3:46:08.880
 just hard to imagine or even remember. It's hard to like, you can often remember an emotion only

3:46:08.880 --> 3:46:13.520
 when you're in a similar sort of emotion situation. And otherwise, you just can't bring the emotion

3:46:13.520 --> 3:46:19.920
 to your mind. And you can't even imagine it, right? So there's certain kinds of emotions you

3:46:19.920 --> 3:46:23.120
 can have. And when you're in that emotion, you can know that you have it and you can have a name

3:46:23.120 --> 3:46:28.880
 and it's associated. But later on, I tell you, you know, remember joy and it doesn't come to mind.

3:46:28.880 --> 3:46:33.840
 You're not able to replay it. Right. And it's sort of a reason why we have one of the reasons

3:46:33.840 --> 3:46:38.720
 that pushes us to re consume it and reproduce it is that we can't reimagine it.

3:46:38.720 --> 3:46:44.720
 Right. Well, there's a, it's interesting because there's a Daniel Kahneman type of thing of like

3:46:44.720 --> 3:46:50.880
 reliving memories because I'm able to summon some aspect of that emotion again by thinking of that

3:46:50.880 --> 3:46:58.000
 situation that from which that emotion came. Right. So like a certain song, you can listen to it

3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:02.080
 and you can feel the same way you felt the first time you remember that song associated with

3:47:02.080 --> 3:47:05.600
 certain things. Right. But you need to remember that situation in some sort of complete package.

3:47:05.600 --> 3:47:09.440
 Yes. You can just take one part off of it. And then if you get the whole package again,

3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:14.720
 if you remember the whole feeling. Yes. Or some fundamental aspect of that whole experience that

3:47:14.720 --> 3:47:18.880
 arouse from which the feeling arose. And actually the feeling is probably different

3:47:19.680 --> 3:47:23.920
 in some way. It could be more pleasant or less pleasant than the feeling you felt originally.

3:47:23.920 --> 3:47:28.160
 And that's more so over time, every time you replay that memory. It is interesting. You're

3:47:28.160 --> 3:47:33.200
 not able to replay the feeling perfectly. You don't remember the feeling. You remember the

3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:38.160
 facts of the events. So there's a sense of which over time, we expand our vocabulary as a community

3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:42.800
 of language. And that allows us to sort of have more feelings and know that we are feeling them.

3:47:43.440 --> 3:47:47.440
 Because you can have a feeling but not have a word for it. And then you don't know how to categorize

3:47:47.440 --> 3:47:51.520
 it or even what it is and whether it's the same as something else. But once you have a word for it,

3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:57.680
 you can sort of pull it together more easily. And so I think over time, we are having a richer

3:47:57.680 --> 3:48:04.720
 palette of feelings. Because we have more words for them. What has been a painful loss in your

3:48:04.720 --> 3:48:12.400
 life? Maybe somebody or something that's no longer in your life but played an important part of your

3:48:12.400 --> 3:48:19.920
 life? Youth. That's a concept. No, it has to be. But I was once younger. I had health and I had

3:48:19.920 --> 3:48:23.920
 vitality. I was insommer. I mean, you know, I've lost that over time. Do you see that as a different

3:48:23.920 --> 3:48:28.480
 person? Maybe you've lost that person? Certainly. Yes, absolutely. I'm a different person than

3:48:28.480 --> 3:48:34.000
 I was when I was younger. And I'm not who I don't even remember exactly what he was. So I don't

3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:38.240
 remember as many things from the past as many people do. So in some sense, I've just lost a lot

3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:43.600
 of my history by not remembering it. And I'm not that person anymore. That person's gone.

3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:50.080
 Is that a painful loss? Is it a painful loss, though? Yeah. Or is it a, why is it painful?

3:48:50.080 --> 3:48:57.840
 Because you're wiser. I mean, there's so many things that are beneficial to getting older.

3:48:58.480 --> 3:49:05.600
 Right. But are you just... I just was this person and I felt assured that I could continue to be

3:49:05.600 --> 3:49:11.440
 that person. And you're no longer that person. And he's gone. And I'm not him anymore. And he died

3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:17.280
 without fanfare or a funeral. And that the person you are today talking to me, that person

3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:25.440
 will be changed too. Yes. And maybe in 20 years, he won't be there anymore. And a future person,

3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:34.080
 we'll look back. For M's, this will be less of a problem. For M's, they would be able to save

3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:38.960
 an archived copy of themselves at each different age. And they could turn it on periodically

3:49:38.960 --> 3:49:46.320
 and go back and talk to it. Do we play? You think some of that will be... So with emulated minds,

3:49:46.320 --> 3:49:57.680
 with M's, there's a digital cloning that happens. And do you think that makes your

3:49:59.680 --> 3:50:08.800
 you less special if you're cloneable? Like, does that make you the experience of life,

3:50:10.080 --> 3:50:14.880
 the experience of a moment, the scarcity of that moment, the scarcity of that experience?

3:50:14.880 --> 3:50:20.160
 Isn't that a fundamental part of what makes that experience so delicious, so rich of feeling?

3:50:20.160 --> 3:50:24.560
 I think if you think of a song that lots of people listen to that are copies all over the

3:50:24.560 --> 3:50:36.800
 world, we're going to call that a more special song. Yeah. So there's a perspective on copying

3:50:36.800 --> 3:50:44.240
 and cloning where you're just scaling happiness versus degrading. Each copy of a song is less

3:50:44.240 --> 3:50:48.480
 special if there are many copies, but the song itself is more special if there are many copies.

3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:55.440
 In a mass, right, you're actually spreading the happiness even if it diminishes over a large

3:50:55.440 --> 3:50:59.920
 number of people at scale and that increases the overall happiness in the world. And then you're

3:50:59.920 --> 3:51:06.800
 able to do that with multiple songs. Is a person who has an identical twin more or less special?

3:51:06.800 --> 3:51:16.720
 Well, the problem with identical twins is, you know, you, it's like just two with Ms.

3:51:16.720 --> 3:51:22.800
 Right, but two is different than one. So I think an identical twin's life is richer for

3:51:22.800 --> 3:51:26.560
 having this other identical twin, somebody who understands them better than anybody else can.

3:51:27.760 --> 3:51:32.400
 From the point of view of an identical twin, I think they have a richer life for being part of

3:51:32.400 --> 3:51:37.040
 this couple, which each of which is very similar. Now, if you said, will the world, you know, if

3:51:37.040 --> 3:51:41.200
 we lose one of the identical twins, will the world miss it as much because you've got the other one

3:51:41.200 --> 3:51:44.240
 and they're pretty similar? Maybe from the rest of the world's point of view, they are,

3:51:44.960 --> 3:51:49.040
 they suffer less of a loss when they lose one of the identical twins. But from the point of view

3:51:49.040 --> 3:51:53.040
 of the identical twin themselves, their life is enriched by having a twin.

3:51:53.600 --> 3:52:01.280
 See, but the identical twin copying happens at the place of birth. That's different than copying

3:52:01.280 --> 3:52:08.000
 after you've done some of the environment, like the nurture at the teenage or the in the 20s.

3:52:08.000 --> 3:52:12.000
 Yes. That'll be an interesting thing for Ms. to find out all the different ways that

3:52:12.000 --> 3:52:16.080
 can have different relationships to different people who have different degrees of similarity

3:52:16.080 --> 3:52:26.320
 to them in time. Yeah. Yeah, I, man. But it seems like a rich space to explore. And I don't feel

3:52:26.320 --> 3:52:30.640
 sorry for them. This sounds like interesting world to live in. And there could be some ethical

3:52:30.640 --> 3:52:36.160
 conundrums there. There will be many new choices to make them. They don't make now. And then we

3:52:36.160 --> 3:52:42.160
 discussed that in the book, Age of M. Say you have a lover and you make a copy of yourself,

3:52:42.160 --> 3:52:48.240
 but the lover doesn't make a copy. Well, now, which one of you or are both still related to the

3:52:48.240 --> 3:52:56.800
 lover? Socially entitled to show up. Yes. So you'll have to make choices then when you split

3:52:56.800 --> 3:53:03.360
 yourself. Which of you inherit which unique things? Yeah. And of course, there'll be

3:53:05.360 --> 3:53:11.040
 an equivalent increase in lawyers. Well, I guess you can clone the lawyers to help

3:53:11.680 --> 3:53:18.080
 manage some of these negotiations of how to split property. The nature of owning, I mean,

3:53:18.080 --> 3:53:24.000
 property is connected to individuals, right? You only really need lawyers for this with

3:53:24.000 --> 3:53:29.040
 an inefficient, awkward law that is not very transparent and able to do things. So, you know,

3:53:29.040 --> 3:53:34.240
 for example, an operating system of a computer is a law for that computer. When the operating

3:53:34.240 --> 3:53:38.560
 system is simple and clean, you don't need to hire a lawyer to make a key choice with the

3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:41.120
 operating system. You don't need a human in the loop. You just make a choice.

3:53:41.120 --> 3:53:45.840
 There are both fine rules. Yeah. Right. So ideally, we want a legal system that makes

3:53:45.840 --> 3:53:52.400
 the common choices easy and not require much overhead. And that's the digitization of things

3:53:52.400 --> 3:54:00.640
 further and further enables that. So the loss of a younger self. What about the loss of your life

3:54:00.640 --> 3:54:06.960
 overall? Do you ponder your death, your mortality? Are you afraid of it? I am a cryonics customer.

3:54:06.960 --> 3:54:12.720
 That's what this little tag around my deck says. It says that if you find me in a medical situation,

3:54:12.720 --> 3:54:20.640
 you should call these people to enable the cryonics transfer. So I am taking a long shot chance at

3:54:20.640 --> 3:54:28.400
 living a much longer life. Can you explain what cryonics is? So when medical science gives up

3:54:28.400 --> 3:54:34.720
 on me in this world, instead of burning me or letting worms eat me, they will freeze me,

3:54:35.520 --> 3:54:40.400
 or at least freeze my head. And there's damage that happens in the process of freezing the head.

3:54:40.400 --> 3:54:45.280
 But once it's frozen, it won't change for a very long time. Chemically, it'll just be

3:54:45.280 --> 3:54:51.600
 completely exactly the same. So future technology might be able to revive me. And in fact,

3:54:51.600 --> 3:54:56.000
 I would be mainly counting on the brain emulation scenario, which doesn't require

3:54:56.000 --> 3:55:00.320
 reviving my entire biological body. It means I would be in a computer simulation.

3:55:02.080 --> 3:55:07.680
 And so that's, I think I've got at least a 5% shot at that. And that's immortality.

3:55:07.680 --> 3:55:16.640
 So most likely, it won't happen. And therefore, I'm sad that it won't happen. Do you think immortality

3:55:16.640 --> 3:55:23.360
 is something that you would like to have? Well, I mean, just like infinity, I mean,

3:55:23.360 --> 3:55:27.840
 you can't know until forever, which means never, right? So all you can really,

3:55:28.640 --> 3:55:33.360
 the better choices at each moment, do you want to keep going? So I would like at every moment

3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:40.320
 to have the option to keep going. The interesting thing about human experience is that

3:55:43.360 --> 3:55:48.000
 the way you phrase it is exactly right. At every moment, I would like to keep going.

3:55:48.720 --> 3:55:56.160
 But the thing that happens, I'll leave them wanting more of whatever that

3:55:56.160 --> 3:56:04.560
 phrase is, the thing that happens is over time, it's possible for certain experiences to become

3:56:04.560 --> 3:56:12.960
 bland. And you become tired of them. And that actually makes life really unpleasant.

3:56:13.920 --> 3:56:19.040
 Sorry, it makes that experience really unpleasant. And perhaps you can generalize that to life itself

3:56:19.040 --> 3:56:24.560
 if you have a long enough horizon. And so might happen, but might as well wait and find out.

3:56:24.560 --> 3:56:30.640
 But then you're ending on suffering, you know? So in the world of brain emulations,

3:56:30.640 --> 3:56:36.800
 I have more options. You can return yourself. That is, I can make copies of myself,

3:56:36.800 --> 3:56:41.920
 archive copies at various ages. And at a later age, I could decide that I'd rather replace

3:56:41.920 --> 3:56:48.320
 myself with a new copy from a younger age. So does a brain emulation still operate in physical

3:56:48.320 --> 3:56:53.360
 space? So can we do, what do you think about like the metaverse and operating virtual reality?

3:56:53.360 --> 3:57:00.320
 So we can conjure up not just emulate, not just your own brain and body, but the entirety of

3:57:00.320 --> 3:57:06.000
 the environment? Well, most brain emulations will in fact, most of their time in virtual reality.

3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:10.560
 But they wouldn't think of it as virtual reality, they would just think of it as their usual reality.

3:57:11.200 --> 3:57:15.600
 I mean, the thing to notice, I think in our world, most of us spend most time indoors.

3:57:15.600 --> 3:57:22.720
 And indoors, we are surrounded by walls covered with paint and floors covered with tile or rugs.

3:57:23.600 --> 3:57:28.720
 Most of our environment is artificial. It's constructed to be convenient for us. It's

3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:33.280
 not the natural world that was there before. A virtual reality is basically just like that.

3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:39.600
 It is the environment that's comfortable and convenient for you. But when it's the right,

3:57:39.600 --> 3:57:43.200
 that environment for you, it's real for you. Just like the room you're in right now,

3:57:43.200 --> 3:57:47.920
 most likely is very real for you. You're not focused on the fact that the paint is hiding

3:57:47.920 --> 3:57:52.160
 the actual studs behind the wall and the actual wires and pipes and everything else.

3:57:52.880 --> 3:57:55.920
 The fact that we're hiding that from you doesn't make it fake or unreal.

3:57:58.400 --> 3:58:04.640
 What are the chances that we're actually in the very kind of system that you're describing where

3:58:04.640 --> 3:58:09.760
 the environment and the brain is being emulated and you're just replaying an experience when you

3:58:09.760 --> 3:58:18.080
 were first did a podcast with Lex. And now the person that originally launched this already

3:58:18.080 --> 3:58:22.640
 did hundreds of podcasts with Lex. This is just the first time and you like this time

3:58:22.640 --> 3:58:26.800
 because there's so much uncertainty. There's nerves. It could have gone any direction.

3:58:28.320 --> 3:58:33.360
 At the moment, we don't have the technical ability to create that emulation. So we'd have to be

3:58:33.360 --> 3:58:38.560
 postulating that in the future. We have that ability and then they choose to evaluate this

3:58:38.560 --> 3:58:44.880
 moment now to simulate it. Don't you think we could be in the simulation of that exact experience

3:58:44.880 --> 3:58:51.040
 right now? We wouldn't be able to know. So one scenario would be this never really happened.

3:58:51.040 --> 3:58:57.040
 This only happens as a reconstruction later on. That's different than the scenario. This did happen

3:58:57.040 --> 3:59:02.640
 the first time and now it's happening again as a reconstruction. That second scenario is harder

3:59:02.640 --> 3:59:07.680
 to put together because it requires this coincidence where between the two times we

3:59:07.680 --> 3:59:12.320
 produce the ability to do it. No, but don't you think replay of memories,

3:59:13.760 --> 3:59:19.600
 poor replay of memories is something that might be a possible thing in the future?

3:59:19.600 --> 3:59:22.720
 You're saying it's harder than to conjure up things from scratch.

3:59:23.600 --> 3:59:28.640
 It's certainly possible. So the main way I would think about it is in terms of the demand

3:59:28.640 --> 3:59:33.120
 for simulation versus other kinds of things. So I've given this a lot of thought because

3:59:33.120 --> 3:59:38.720
 I first wrote about this long ago when Bostrom first wrote his papers about simulation argument

3:59:38.720 --> 3:59:48.000
 and I wrote about how to live in a simulation. So the key issue is the fraction of creatures in

3:59:48.000 --> 3:59:52.880
 the universe that are really experiencing what you appear to be really experiencing relative

3:59:52.880 --> 4:00:01.040
 to the fraction that are experiencing it in a simulation way, i.e. simulated. So then the key

4:00:01.040 --> 4:00:07.360
 parameter is at any one moment in time, creatures at that time, many of them, most of them are

4:00:07.360 --> 4:00:11.600
 presumably really experiencing what they're experiencing, but some fraction of them are

4:00:11.600 --> 4:00:18.320
 experiencing some past time where that past time is being remembered via their simulation.

4:00:19.680 --> 4:00:26.720
 So to figure out this ratio, what we need to think about is basically two functions. One is

4:00:26.720 --> 4:00:32.640
 how fast in time does the number of creatures grow? And then how fast in time does the interest

4:00:32.640 --> 4:00:38.960
 in the past decline? Because at any one time, people will be simulating different periods in

4:00:38.960 --> 4:00:44.160
 the past with different emphasis. I love the way you think so much. That's exactly right, yeah.

4:00:44.160 --> 4:00:51.360
 So if the first function grows slower than the second one declines, then in fact,

4:00:51.360 --> 4:00:58.080
 your chances of being simulated are low. So the key question is how fast does interest in the

4:00:58.080 --> 4:01:02.720
 past decline relative to the rate at which the population grows with time? Does this correlate

4:01:02.720 --> 4:01:08.720
 to you earlier suggested that the interest in the future increases over time? Are those correlated

4:01:08.720 --> 4:01:12.480
 interest in the future versus interest in the past? Why are we interested in the past?

4:01:13.360 --> 4:01:18.160
 But the simple way to do it is, as you know, like Google Ngrams has a way to type in a word

4:01:18.160 --> 4:01:23.520
 and see how interest in it declines or rises over time. You can just type in a year and get

4:01:23.520 --> 4:01:30.480
 the answer for that. If you type in a particular year like 1900 or 1950, you can see with Google

4:01:30.480 --> 4:01:35.120
 Ngram how interest in that year increased up until that date and decreased after it.

4:01:36.080 --> 4:01:42.240
 And you can see that interest in a date declines faster than does the population grow with time.

4:01:42.240 --> 4:01:51.920
 That is brilliant. And so interesting. You have the answer. Wow. And that was your argument

4:01:51.920 --> 4:01:59.520
 against, not against, to this particular aspect of the simulation, how much past simulation there

4:01:59.520 --> 4:02:04.560
 will be replay of past memories. First of all, if we assume that like simulation of the past is

4:02:04.560 --> 4:02:10.400
 a small fraction of all the creatures at that moment. Yes. Right. And then it's about how fast.

4:02:10.400 --> 4:02:15.680
 Now, some people have argued plausibly that maybe most interest in the past falls with

4:02:15.680 --> 4:02:20.240
 this fast function, but some unusual category of interest in the past won't fall that fat quickly,

4:02:20.240 --> 4:02:24.240
 and then that eventually would dominate. So that's a other hypothesis you want.

4:02:24.240 --> 4:02:30.000
 Some category. So that very outlier specific kind of, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like

4:02:30.000 --> 4:02:36.480
 really popular kinds of memories, but like probably sexual. In a trillion years, there's

4:02:36.480 --> 4:02:41.360
 some small research institute that tries to randomly select from all possible people in

4:02:41.360 --> 4:02:48.320
 history or something to simulate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some questions, how big is this research

4:02:48.320 --> 4:02:52.480
 institute and how big is the future in a trillion years, right? And that's, that would be hard to

4:02:52.480 --> 4:02:58.000
 say. But if we just look at the ordinary process by which people simulate recent here. So if you

4:02:58.000 --> 4:03:03.280
 look at, it's also true for movies and plays and video games, overwhelming, they're interested

4:03:03.280 --> 4:03:07.440
 in the recent past. There's very few video games where you play someone in the Roman Empire.

4:03:08.000 --> 4:03:12.320
 Right. Even fewer where you play someone in the Egyptian Empire.

4:03:14.240 --> 4:03:17.840
 Yeah, just different. It's just declined very quickly. But every once in a while,

4:03:17.840 --> 4:03:25.120
 that's brought back. But yeah, you're right. I mean, just if you look at the mass of entertainment

4:03:25.120 --> 4:03:30.400
 movies and games, it's focusing on the present recent past. And maybe some, I mean,

4:03:30.400 --> 4:03:39.200
 where does science fiction fit into this? Because it's sort of a, what is science fiction? I mean,

4:03:39.200 --> 4:03:44.480
 it's a mix of the past and the present and some kind of manipulation of that to make it more

4:03:44.480 --> 4:03:49.600
 efficient for us to ask deep philosophical questions about humanity. So the closest genre

4:03:49.600 --> 4:03:53.840
 to science fiction is clearly fantasy, fantasy and science fiction in many bookstores and even

4:03:53.840 --> 4:03:57.840
 Netflix or whatever categories, they're just lumped together. So clearly they have a similar

4:03:57.840 --> 4:04:02.800
 function. So the function of fantasy is more transparent than the function of science fiction,

4:04:02.800 --> 4:04:08.240
 so use that as your guide. What's fantasy for is just to take away the constraints of the

4:04:08.240 --> 4:04:12.400
 ordinary world and imagine stories with much fewer constraints. But that's what fantasy is.

4:04:12.400 --> 4:04:16.480
 You're much less constrained. What's the purpose to remove constraints? Is it to escape

4:04:17.120 --> 4:04:22.000
 from the harshness of the constraints of the real world? Or is it to just remove constraints in

4:04:22.000 --> 4:04:28.240
 order to explore some, get a deeper understanding of our world? What is it? I mean, why do people

4:04:28.240 --> 4:04:34.960
 read fantasy? I'm not a cheap fantasy reading kind of person. So I need to...

4:04:36.320 --> 4:04:40.720
 One story that it sounds plausible to me is that there are sort of these deep story structures

4:04:40.720 --> 4:04:45.760
 that we love and we want to realize. And then many details of the world get in their way.

4:04:46.560 --> 4:04:51.280
 Fantasy takes all those obstacles out of the way and lets you tell the essential hero story or

4:04:51.280 --> 4:04:56.320
 the essential love story, whatever essential story you want to tell. The reality and constraints

4:04:56.320 --> 4:05:02.000
 are not in the way. And so science fiction can be thought of as like fantasy, except you're not

4:05:02.000 --> 4:05:06.720
 willing to admit that it can't be true. So the future gives the excuse of saying, well, it could

4:05:06.720 --> 4:05:13.920
 happen. And you accept some more reality constraints for the illusion, at least, that maybe it could

4:05:13.920 --> 4:05:21.760
 really happen. Maybe it could happen. And that it stimulates the imagination. The imagination is

4:05:21.760 --> 4:05:27.040
 something really interesting about human beings. And it seems also to be an important part of

4:05:27.040 --> 4:05:32.000
 creating really special things is to be able to first imagine them. With you and Nick Bostrom,

4:05:32.800 --> 4:05:39.360
 where do you land on the simulation and all the mathematical ways of thinking it and just

4:05:39.360 --> 4:05:46.160
 the thought experiment of it? Are we living in a simulation? Well, that was the discussion we

4:05:46.160 --> 4:05:51.040
 just had. That is, you should grant the possibility of being a simulation. You shouldn't be 100%

4:05:51.040 --> 4:05:54.560
 confident that you're not. You should certainly grant a small probability. The question is,

4:05:54.560 --> 4:06:00.560
 how large is that probability? Are you saying we would be misunderstood because I thought our

4:06:00.560 --> 4:06:04.480
 discussion was about replaying things that already happened? Right. But the whole question is,

4:06:04.480 --> 4:06:11.760
 right now, is that what I am? Am I actually a replay from some distant future?

4:06:11.760 --> 4:06:16.560
 But it doesn't necessarily need to be a replay. It could be a totally new. You don't have to be

4:06:16.560 --> 4:06:21.040
 an NPC. Right. But clearly, I'm in a certain era with a certain kind of world around me, right? So

4:06:21.040 --> 4:06:24.560
 either this is a complete fantasy or it's a past of somebody else in the future.

4:06:25.600 --> 4:06:29.520
 But no, it could be a complete fantasy, though. It could be, right. But then you might,

4:06:29.520 --> 4:06:32.400
 then you have to talk about what's the fraction of complete fantasies, right?

4:06:32.400 --> 4:06:37.120
 I would say it's easier to generate a fantasy than to replay a memory, right?

4:06:37.120 --> 4:06:41.680
 Sure. But if we just look at the entire history, if we just look at the entire history of everything,

4:06:41.680 --> 4:06:45.600
 we just say, sure, but most things are real. Most things aren't fantasies, right? Therefore,

4:06:45.600 --> 4:06:50.160
 the chance that my thing is real, right? So the simulation argument works stronger about sort of

4:06:50.160 --> 4:06:55.040
 the past. We say, ah, but there's more future people than there are today. So you being in

4:06:55.040 --> 4:06:59.280
 the past of the future makes you special relative to them, which makes you more likely to be in a

4:06:59.280 --> 4:07:03.600
 simulation, right? If we're just taking the full count and saying, in all creatures ever,

4:07:03.600 --> 4:07:09.520
 what percentage are in simulations? Probably no more than 10%. So what's the good argument for

4:07:09.520 --> 4:07:14.240
 that? That most things are real? Yeah. Because as Foster says the other way, right?

4:07:14.960 --> 4:07:20.800
 In a competitive world, in a world where people have to work and have to get things done,

4:07:20.800 --> 4:07:28.880
 then they have a limited budget for leisure. And so leisure things are less common than work

4:07:28.880 --> 4:07:36.800
 things, like real things, right? But if you look at the stretch of history in the universe,

4:07:37.760 --> 4:07:45.440
 doesn't the ratio of leisure increase? Isn't that the forgery?

4:07:45.440 --> 4:07:48.960
 Right. But now we're looking at the fraction of leisure, which takes the form of something

4:07:48.960 --> 4:07:53.040
 where the person doing the leisure doesn't realize it. And there could be some fraction,

4:07:53.040 --> 4:08:00.720
 but that's much smaller, right? Yeah. Clueless forgers. Or somebody is clueless in the process

4:08:00.720 --> 4:08:04.320
 of supporting this leisure, right? It might not be the person leisureing, somebody,

4:08:04.320 --> 4:08:07.360
 they're a supporting character or something, but still that's got to be a pretty small fraction

4:08:07.360 --> 4:08:12.880
 of leisure. What you mentioned that children are one of the things that are a source of meaning.

4:08:13.760 --> 4:08:17.920
 Broadly speaking, then let me ask the big question. What's the meaning of this whole thing?

4:08:17.920 --> 4:08:25.360
 The Robin meaning of life. What is the meaning of life? We talked about alien civilizations,

4:08:26.080 --> 4:08:29.680
 but this is the one we got. Where are the aliens? Where are the human?

4:08:30.960 --> 4:08:37.280
 Seem to be conscious, be able to introspect. Why are we here?

4:08:37.280 --> 4:08:41.680
 This is the thing I told you before about how we can predict that future creatures will be

4:08:41.680 --> 4:08:49.920
 different from us. We, our preferences are this amalgam of various sorts of random sort of patched

4:08:49.920 --> 4:08:56.800
 together preferences about thirst and sex and sleep and attention and all these sorts of things.

4:08:57.360 --> 4:09:02.560
 So we don't understand it very well. It's not very transparent and it's a mess, right?

4:09:03.360 --> 4:09:10.160
 That is the source of our motivation. That is how we were made and how we are induced to do things.

4:09:10.160 --> 4:09:13.760
 But we can't summarize it very well and we don't even understand it very well.

4:09:14.320 --> 4:09:18.640
 That's who we are. And often we find ourselves in a situation where we don't feel very motivated.

4:09:18.640 --> 4:09:22.640
 We don't know why. In other situations, we find ourselves very motivated and we don't know why either.

4:09:25.040 --> 4:09:30.400
 And so that's the nature of being a human of the sort that we are because even though we can

4:09:30.400 --> 4:09:35.120
 think abstractly and reason abstractly, this package of motivations is just opaque and a mess.

4:09:35.120 --> 4:09:40.720
 And that's what it means to be a human today and the motivation. We can't very well tell the meaning

4:09:40.720 --> 4:09:46.000
 of our life. It is this mess that our descendants will be different. They will actually know exactly

4:09:46.000 --> 4:09:51.520
 what they want and it will be to have more descendants. That will be the meaning for them.

4:09:51.520 --> 4:09:56.640
 Well, it's funny that you have the certainty. You have more certainty. You have more transparency

4:09:56.640 --> 4:10:05.760
 about our descendants than you do about your own self. So it's really interesting to think,

4:10:05.760 --> 4:10:12.160
 because you mentioned this about love, that something that's fundamental about love is

4:10:12.160 --> 4:10:18.480
 this opaqueness that we're not able to really introspect what the heck it is or all the feelings,

4:10:18.480 --> 4:10:21.440
 the complex feelings involved with it. And that's true about many of our motivations.

4:10:21.440 --> 4:10:28.560
 And that's what it means to be human of the 20th and the 21st century variety.

4:10:29.680 --> 4:10:36.960
 Why is that not a feature that we will choose to persist in civilization then?

4:10:36.960 --> 4:10:42.960
 This opaqueness put another way, maintaining a certain mystery about ourselves and about those

4:10:42.960 --> 4:10:49.760
 around us. Maybe that's a really nice thing to have. Maybe, but so this is the fundamental

4:10:49.760 --> 4:10:55.440
 issue in analyzing the future. What will set the future? One theory about what will set the future

4:10:55.440 --> 4:11:00.480
 is, what do we want the future to be? So under that theory, we should sit and talk about what

4:11:00.480 --> 4:11:04.800
 we want the future to be, have some conferences, have some conventions, discussion things,

4:11:04.800 --> 4:11:09.360
 vote on it maybe, and then hand out off to the implementation people to make the future

4:11:09.360 --> 4:11:15.040
 the way we've decided it should be. That's not the actual process that's changed the world

4:11:15.040 --> 4:11:20.080
 over history up to this point. It has not been the result of us deciding what we want and making

4:11:20.080 --> 4:11:24.800
 it happen. In our individual lives, we can do that and we might decide what career we want or

4:11:24.800 --> 4:11:29.680
 where we want to live, who we want to live with. In our individual lives, we often do slowly make

4:11:29.680 --> 4:11:33.120
 our lives better according to our plan and our things, but that's not the whole world.

4:11:34.400 --> 4:11:38.880
 The whole world so far has mostly been a competitive world where things happen if

4:11:38.880 --> 4:11:43.200
 anybody anywhere chooses to adopt them and they have an advantage. And then it spreads and other

4:11:43.200 --> 4:11:47.920
 people are forced to adopt it by competitive pressures. So that's the kind of analysis I

4:11:47.920 --> 4:11:51.440
 can use to predict the future. And I do use that to predict the future. It doesn't tell us

4:11:51.440 --> 4:11:56.080
 it'll be a future we like, it just tells us what it'll be. And it'll be one where we're trying to

4:11:56.080 --> 4:12:01.600
 maximize the number of our descendants. And we know that abstractly and directly, and it's not opaque.

4:12:01.600 --> 4:12:09.360
 With some probability that's nonzero, that will lead us to become grabby in expanding

4:12:09.360 --> 4:12:13.200
 being aggressively out into the cosmos until we meet other aliens.

4:12:13.680 --> 4:12:17.360
 The timing isn't clear. We might become grabby and then this happens. These are

4:12:18.240 --> 4:12:22.080
 grabbing us and this are both the results of competition, but it's less clear which happens

4:12:22.080 --> 4:12:27.920
 first. Does this future excite you or scare you? How do you feel about this whole thing?

4:12:27.920 --> 4:12:32.720
 Well, again, I told you compared to sort of a dead cosmology, at least it's energizing and

4:12:32.720 --> 4:12:36.160
 having a living story with real actors and characters and agendas, right?

4:12:36.160 --> 4:12:40.720
 Right. Yeah. And that's one hell of a fun universe to live in.

4:12:40.720 --> 4:12:45.040
 Robin, you're one of the most fascinating, fun people to talk to, brilliant,

4:12:45.760 --> 4:12:50.800
 humble, systematic in your analysis. Hold on to my wallet here. What's he looking for?

4:12:50.800 --> 4:12:54.960
 I already stole your wallet long ago. I really, really appreciate you spending your valuable

4:12:54.960 --> 4:12:59.520
 time with me. I hope you get a chance to talk many more times in the future.

4:12:59.520 --> 4:13:01.680
 Thank you so much for sitting down. Thank you.

4:13:01.680 --> 4:13:07.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Robin Hansen. To support this podcast,

4:13:07.280 --> 4:13:12.160
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

4:13:12.160 --> 4:13:19.680
 Ray Bradbury. We are an impossibility in an impossible universe. Thank you for listening

4:13:19.680 --> 4:13:32.800
