00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
 There are no right answers for anything involved in art.

00:02.480 --> 00:06.480
 It's, we're all trying experiments to find a way.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.320
 And even for the things that I work on,

00:08.320 --> 00:10.400
 I don't have a set way that I do anything.

00:10.400 --> 00:13.960
 Every, I come to every project blank.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.200
 Maybe you're just a meat vehicle

00:16.200 --> 00:18.560
 and you're channeling ideas from somewhere else.

00:18.560 --> 00:23.560
 I believe we know close to nothing, close to nothing

00:23.880 --> 00:25.480
 about anything.

00:25.480 --> 00:30.480
 If we embrace that not knowing, we'll have a healthier experience

00:30.900 --> 00:31.840
 going through life.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.880
 The following is a conversation with Rick Rubin,

00:36.880 --> 00:40.320
 one of the greatest music producers of all time,

00:40.320 --> 00:43.640
 known for bringing the best out of anyone he works with,

00:43.640 --> 00:47.080
 no matter the genre of music, or even the medium of art,

00:47.080 --> 00:49.120
 or just the medium of creating something

00:49.120 --> 00:50.960
 beautiful in this world.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.120
 And the list of musicians he produced includes many,

00:54.120 --> 00:57.760
 many, many of the greats over the past 40 years,

00:57.760 --> 01:01.760
 including the Beastie Boys, Eminem, Metallica,

01:01.760 --> 01:04.640
 LL Cool J, Kanye West, Slayer, Tom Petty,

01:04.640 --> 01:08.280
 Johnny Cash, Dixie Chicks, Aerosmith, Adele,

01:08.280 --> 01:12.680
 Danzig, Red Hot Chili Peppers, System of a Down, JZ,

01:12.680 --> 01:16.560
 Black Sabbath, I can keep going for a very long time here.

01:16.560 --> 01:20.640
 Most importantly, Rick is just an amazing human being.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.880
 We became fast friends, which is surreal to say

01:23.880 --> 01:26.680
 and is just an incredible honor.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.320
 I felt truly heard as a person when I spent the day

01:29.320 --> 01:32.440
 with him, eating some delicious Texas barbecue,

01:32.440 --> 01:37.560
 talking about life, about music, about art, about beauty.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.260
 This was a conversation and experience I will never forget.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.360
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.560
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:46.560 --> 01:47.800
 in the description.

01:47.800 --> 01:51.280
 And now, dear friends, here's Rick Rubin.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.760
 Are you nervous?

01:53.760 --> 01:57.280
 I'm not shaky, but I would say I feel uneasy.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.640
 And I feel like as soon as we start talking,

01:59.640 --> 02:01.360
 the more relaxed we'll get.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.280
 Yeah.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.960
 Well, maybe we should sit in this moment

02:03.960 --> 02:05.860
 and enjoy the nervousness of it.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.780
 Let me start with Nietzsche.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.960
 He said, without music, life would be a mistake.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.700
 What do you think he means by that?

02:14.700 --> 02:16.000
 Let's talk some philosophy.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.120
 Let's try to analyze Friedrich Nietzsche

02:18.120 --> 02:19.360
 from a century ago.

02:19.360 --> 02:24.360
 It seems like music has the ability

02:26.040 --> 02:31.040
 to bring us so much depth in our soul

02:31.780 --> 02:33.760
 that's hard to access any other way.

02:34.720 --> 02:39.040
 And without it, there would be a loss beyond the pleasure

02:39.040 --> 02:39.880
 of it.

02:41.560 --> 02:45.200
 It feels like it's a window into something else.

02:45.200 --> 02:49.520
 Something that no other medium can express quite

02:49.520 --> 02:51.040
 the same way.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.080
 I would say not as automatically.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.440
 Something about music can do it automatically.

02:56.440 --> 03:01.440
 Maybe poetry or maybe certain abstract forms

03:02.360 --> 03:04.660
 can get us there.

03:04.660 --> 03:06.860
 But there's something about music

03:06.860 --> 03:09.360
 that really can get us there quickly.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.000
 But it's also the time, the place, the history.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.400
 There's something about, a lot of my family's still in Philly.

03:16.400 --> 03:20.600
 There's something about driving through Jersey

03:20.600 --> 03:22.880
 and listening to Bruce Springsteen.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.840
 And then you just, I'll get emotional.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.000
 Like listening to like, I'm on fire.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.880
 That like, one of my favorite Bruce Springsteen songs,

03:33.880 --> 03:38.640
 there's a haunting kind of strumming to it.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.760
 It's not a strumming, it's actually picked

03:41.760 --> 03:44.400
 as a country feel to it, almost like a Johnny Cash feel

03:44.400 --> 03:45.240
 actually.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.640
 And it, I don't know, makes me feel,

03:47.640 --> 03:50.080
 so for people who don't know, I'm on fire.

03:50.080 --> 03:55.080
 That song is, I guess, a love song to a woman

03:56.900 --> 04:01.900
 that you can't have because she's married

04:02.200 --> 04:03.800
 or she's with somebody else.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.360
 Which I guess is quite a lot of love songs.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.480
 But there's something about the haunting nature

04:08.480 --> 04:12.920
 of the guitar, and then it has to be driving through Jersey.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.000
 And I feel like everyone has fallen in love

04:16.000 --> 04:18.920
 with a Jersey girl at one point in their life.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.040
 I don't know if that's true for everybody.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.400
 But I feel like that, I haven't either,

04:23.400 --> 04:25.640
 but I just feel like that.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.080
 There's something about Bruce Springsteen is like,

04:27.080 --> 04:28.440
 yeah, I've been there.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.720
 And that just takes you to a place of emotion

04:33.720 --> 04:37.320
 that you just, that captures love,

04:37.320 --> 04:40.880
 that captures longing, that captures the heartbreak

04:40.880 --> 04:42.440
 of just the way time flows in life.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.560
 And in fact, it's finite.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.960
 And just all of that in a single, simple song.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.280
 Like what else can capture that?

04:49.280 --> 04:50.720
 Yeah, I don't know.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.920
 But it's true that there's a connection

04:53.920 --> 04:55.720
 both between time and place and music.

04:55.720 --> 05:00.720
 And certain music growing up on the East Coast

05:02.000 --> 05:03.280
 didn't really resonate with me

05:03.280 --> 05:05.240
 until I spent time on the West Coast.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.680
 Eagles being an example.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.240
 When I lived in New York,

05:08.240 --> 05:09.880
 the Eagles didn't really speak to me.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.440
 ZZ Top didn't really speak to me.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.760
 And then when I started spending time in California

05:14.760 --> 05:16.880
 and driving through Laurel Canyon,

05:16.880 --> 05:20.120
 all of a sudden the music of the Eagles felt

05:20.120 --> 05:21.920
 appropriate somehow.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.880
 And I started listening to it more.

05:23.880 --> 05:24.720
 Got it.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.120
 So not until you went out West,

05:26.120 --> 05:29.560
 can you understand the sounds of the West?

05:29.560 --> 05:32.680
 So it's really like New York has a sound.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.960
 What are the places of a sound in the United States?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.760
 I think every place does.

05:36.760 --> 05:40.400
 And that said, sometimes we can get an experience

05:40.400 --> 05:42.840
 through music of a place.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.280
 Like we can resonate with the music

05:44.280 --> 05:45.560
 and not understand why.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.840
 And then maybe when we go to the place where it was created,

05:49.840 --> 05:52.040
 it's almost like we have a knowingness of that place.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.040
 It's not a strange place anymore.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
 Yeah, Steve Ray Vaughn with Blues and Texas Blues.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.680
 You can just listen to Texas Flood and just,

06:01.680 --> 06:03.920
 again, this is like a woman you're missing,

06:03.920 --> 06:07.240
 a broken heart and somehow that connects to the place.

06:07.240 --> 06:11.440
 The Eagles, what song of the Eagles connects with you?

06:11.440 --> 06:15.560
 Are we talking about like Take It Easy

06:15.560 --> 06:18.480
 or are we talking more like Hotel California?

06:18.480 --> 06:21.280
 I'm thinking Take It Easy, but both are great.

06:22.120 --> 06:22.960
 Yeah.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.200
 There's certain songs when I started learning guitar

06:25.200 --> 06:27.680
 when I was young, that's like,

06:27.680 --> 06:29.520
 I wouldn't like to be the kind of person

06:29.520 --> 06:31.960
 that not only knows how to play this song,

06:31.960 --> 06:35.520
 but understands the song and like,

06:35.520 --> 06:39.200
 have that song be something I played 20 years ago.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.680
 And I've lived with that song for a while.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.280
 Like Hotel California is an example.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.480
 The obviously there's the solo,

06:47.480 --> 06:50.360
 but there's also the soulfulness of the lyrics,

06:50.360 --> 06:51.760
 which I still don't understand.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.920
 And it could be about anything.

06:52.920 --> 06:53.840
 And as you get older,

06:53.840 --> 06:56.080
 I feel like the meaning of the song could be anything.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.760
 Yeah, I think that's true.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.040
 I think that's the beauty of them.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.280
 I think when the person wrote them,

07:00.280 --> 07:03.280
 they may have had one interpretation,

07:04.800 --> 07:08.400
 but it's not contingent on us getting that interpretation

07:08.400 --> 07:12.800
 to like it or resonate with it or feel it.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.680
 In some ways, the best art is open enough

07:18.760 --> 07:21.640
 where the artist gets to have their experience

07:21.640 --> 07:23.440
 when they make it and then the audience

07:23.440 --> 07:25.080
 gets to have their experience when they listen

07:25.080 --> 07:26.880
 and they don't have to be the same.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.800
 And then it connects thousands or millions of people

07:29.800 --> 07:32.720
 together, there's a togetherness of music

07:32.720 --> 07:34.200
 when you share that music,

07:34.200 --> 07:36.840
 when you're listening to stuff together, like in a car.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.720
 First of all, the car is a sacred place.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.960
 So I work in part on autonomous vehicles.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.440
 And you start to think,

07:44.440 --> 07:46.760
 well, what are the things you lose

07:46.760 --> 07:49.960
 when the car stops being the central part

07:49.960 --> 07:54.880
 of American life, the car ownership?

07:54.880 --> 07:57.800
 It just feels like the car, when you're alone,

07:57.800 --> 08:01.120
 it's like a therapist thing session

08:01.120 --> 08:04.240
 because you get angry at other humans,

08:04.240 --> 08:09.240
 you get to sit in your own anger and emotion,

08:09.560 --> 08:12.280
 you get to listen to the song on a long road trip

08:12.280 --> 08:16.960
 and remember, like run through your memories,

08:16.960 --> 08:20.320
 the heartbreak, I don't know, the one that got away,

08:20.320 --> 08:23.480
 but also like the beautiful moments, all of it.

08:23.480 --> 08:27.960
 Yeah, and all of that in the car.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.440
 Yeah, driving also serves another purpose in,

08:31.440 --> 08:34.720
 it's one of the things that we can do that

08:37.120 --> 08:41.160
 we have to pay attention enough not to crash,

08:41.160 --> 08:45.640
 but typically can essentially run on autopilot enough

08:45.640 --> 08:47.560
 where we could be thinking about something else

08:47.560 --> 08:50.560
 or concentrating on something else.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.480
 And the difference between concentrating on something

08:53.480 --> 08:55.520
 or trying to solve a problem

08:55.520 --> 08:57.560
 when you're solely trying to solve a problem

08:57.560 --> 08:59.600
 versus when you have some little task

08:59.600 --> 09:01.920
 that's keeping you occupied,

09:01.920 --> 09:04.920
 I find if I have some slight,

09:04.920 --> 09:09.040
 something slight to take care of,

09:09.040 --> 09:12.960
 it frees a more creative side of my mind

09:12.960 --> 09:15.520
 to better solve problems.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.240
 You know, I'm kind of jealous of people

09:17.240 --> 09:19.720
 that found that in painting, for example,

09:19.720 --> 09:22.680
 they'll be drawing or painting and listening to,

09:22.680 --> 09:25.080
 so that's the small task you do.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.400
 You're coloring in the lines,

09:27.400 --> 09:31.600
 it's like this gentle, peaceful, slow process

09:31.600 --> 09:33.800
 that requires just a small fraction of your mind,

09:33.800 --> 09:34.800
 and then you can listen.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.960
 Some people listen to podcasts that way,

09:36.960 --> 09:39.120
 some people listen to music that way.

09:39.120 --> 09:39.960
 Yeah.

09:39.960 --> 09:40.960
 How do you do it?

09:40.960 --> 09:42.960
 How do you free your mind?

09:42.960 --> 09:47.960
 Running is one of them.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.040
 There's a process,

09:54.040 --> 09:57.120
 so the most freeing of the mind for me

09:57.120 --> 10:01.400
 has to go through a process of a bit of pain for a bit.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.040
 So doing something difficult,

10:04.040 --> 10:06.960
 it's just like an airplane taking off or something.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.120
 So that's like, for example, running,

10:09.120 --> 10:11.800
 the first few miles would just be just,

10:11.800 --> 10:14.240
 first of all, the physical aspect,

10:14.240 --> 10:16.760
 which is like, ah, you're so fat, you're out of shape,

10:16.760 --> 10:19.600
 you're, this is, this is getting old, this, that.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.480
 Okay, that slowly dissipates.

10:21.480 --> 10:25.120
 And then the demons come in who are like,

10:25.120 --> 10:29.600
 you should be getting this and that and this done,

10:29.600 --> 10:30.960
 you haven't gotten it done,

10:30.960 --> 10:33.120
 you're like breaking promises,

10:33.120 --> 10:35.560
 all those kinds of voices coming in.

10:35.560 --> 10:40.560
 And after that, maybe mile four, it's like, fuck it.

10:40.560 --> 10:45.000
 You just run, run with the wind at a very slow pace,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.960
 but with the wind and then you could think.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.960
 So it's the footsteps, the physical activity,

10:50.960 --> 10:54.640
 then you could deeply think about stuff, ideas,

10:54.640 --> 10:57.000
 sort of design, whether it's program design stuff

10:57.000 --> 10:59.360
 or like high level life decisions,

10:59.360 --> 11:02.480
 all those kinds of things, I would say running.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.600
 I used to build bridges from toothpicks.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.880
 I used to be a thing, it's an engineering,

11:08.880 --> 11:11.640
 I guess some people like glue together airplanes

11:11.640 --> 11:13.080
 and stuff like that.

11:13.080 --> 11:17.520
 But the bridges, it's such deeply honest work

11:17.520 --> 11:19.760
 because at the end of it, you're gonna have to test

11:19.760 --> 11:24.120
 that bridge and you're gonna see how good your work was,

11:24.120 --> 11:26.680
 the little details, but also the big picture.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.720
 Do you use glue or no?

11:28.720 --> 11:30.760
 Yeah, you use glue.

11:30.760 --> 11:35.760
 So it's not pure physics, it's materials engineering too.

11:35.760 --> 11:40.760
 Because the way you want to do it is you actually split

11:41.200 --> 11:43.960
 the wood as thin as possible and then glue back together

11:43.960 --> 11:48.240
 because glue is really strong except for the arches

11:48.240 --> 11:49.080
 and things like that.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.720
 So you're building arch bridges,

11:50.720 --> 11:52.280
 which is a whole nother skill,

11:52.280 --> 11:54.440
 because you have to bend the wood.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.280
 And it's so cool because the thing can hold

11:56.280 --> 11:58.840
 thousands of times its weight.

11:58.840 --> 12:03.840
 And then you get to watch it explode at a certain point

12:03.840 --> 12:05.600
 from the pressure.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.440
 And when you do a really good job,

12:07.440 --> 12:11.640
 it doesn't explode in a kind of some weak point

12:11.640 --> 12:14.680
 that you didn't anticipate just kind of starts cracking.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.280
 Everything cracks, everything explodes.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.440
 It's just pieces fly everywhere.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.560
 And it's literally hundreds of hours of work

12:23.560 --> 12:26.600
 just explode in front of you.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.440
 And that's a metaphor for life maybe.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.120
 And it's all for nothing except for the journey

12:33.120 --> 12:35.000
 that you took to get there.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.640
 And no one understands.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.680
 Speaking of which, back to Nietzsche.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.320
 These questions are ridiculous.

12:42.320 --> 12:46.040
 So you're gonna have to try to figure out

12:46.040 --> 12:48.440
 what the heck I'm trying to do here.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.760
 So Nietzsche also said,

12:51.560 --> 12:53.280
 a line of love, which is,

12:53.280 --> 12:56.340
 and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane

12:56.340 --> 12:58.320
 by those who could not hear the music.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.520
 Do you, Rick Rubin, ever feel crazy?

13:02.520 --> 13:05.880
 Or maybe you're the one who's sane

13:05.880 --> 13:07.280
 and everybody else is crazy.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.920
 You know that the dancing, the joy of the music,

13:11.920 --> 13:14.760
 of just feeling the music and everybody else

13:14.760 --> 13:15.840
 just doesn't understand.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.720
 And this doesn't have to be literally about music.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.280
 This is about art, about creation.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.920
 I would say I feel different.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.400
 And it's hard to say it's like,

13:29.400 --> 13:33.600
 which side of the equation is crazy, you know?

13:33.600 --> 13:37.080
 Did you ever find a group of people

13:37.080 --> 13:39.120
 that you get, they get you?

13:39.120 --> 13:39.960
 Yes.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.120
 Is that what producing is essentially?

13:42.120 --> 13:43.480
 Is you tried to find the moments

13:43.480 --> 13:45.520
 when you just get each other?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.360
 No.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.600
 I would say they're definitely

13:55.880 --> 13:58.400
 certain artists with certain temperaments

13:58.400 --> 13:59.560
 when you're around them,

13:59.560 --> 14:02.600
 it feels like you can finish each other's sentences.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.840
 Just see the world the same way.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.080
 Comedians as well.

14:07.920 --> 14:12.920
 And that's not essential for the two of you together

14:13.080 --> 14:14.680
 creating something special.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.080
 No.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.120
 So it could be attention too.

14:18.120 --> 14:18.960
 It could be anything.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.480
 It could be any, there's no rules.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.160
 It'd be like, think of it like a coach.

14:24.160 --> 14:29.160
 A coach could bring what they have to bring

14:29.520 --> 14:34.520
 to any talented individual and help them find their way.

14:36.880 --> 14:40.400
 And sometimes the right coach for the right athlete

14:40.400 --> 14:44.040
 really works and other times there's a mismatch.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.600
 Have you seen the movie, Whiplash?

14:46.600 --> 14:47.440
 I did.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.280
 I saw it when it came out

14:48.280 --> 14:49.920
 so I don't really remember it well, but I did see it.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.600
 So there's a coach type of figure.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.440
 Yes.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.120
 Who is pushing a drummer to create,

14:56.120 --> 14:58.280
 to grow as a musician,

14:58.280 --> 15:00.160
 but also to create something special.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.320
 I don't know if it's even special music skill wise,

15:02.320 --> 15:04.080
 it's a special moment.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.040
 I don't know what he's trying to create.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.160
 From one perspective, it's just an abusive,

15:08.160 --> 15:11.280
 a person who selfishly gets off on being abusive

15:11.280 --> 15:12.680
 to those he's with.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.720
 But from another perspective, the way I saw that movie,

15:15.720 --> 15:19.600
 is it's just the two right humans

15:19.600 --> 15:21.800
 finding each other at the right moment in life

15:21.800 --> 15:24.360
 and risking destroying each other in the process,

15:24.360 --> 15:27.720
 but maybe something beautiful will come of it.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.960
 Do you think that's a toxic relationship?

15:32.920 --> 15:37.640
 Or is there, does some of that movie resonate with you

15:37.640 --> 15:40.680
 as that sometimes is required to create art?

15:42.720 --> 15:43.640
 That kind of suffering?

15:43.640 --> 15:44.960
 Yeah, it doesn't.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.160
 Well, there's suffering involved,

15:46.160 --> 15:47.600
 but not that kind of suffering.

15:49.840 --> 15:50.680
 Not for me.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.200
 There are some people who that's their process

15:53.200 --> 15:55.280
 and that's whatever works.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.440
 There's no right answers for anything involved in art.

15:58.440 --> 16:02.440
 It's, we're all trying experiments to find a way.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.280
 And even for the things that I work on,

16:04.280 --> 16:06.360
 I don't have a set way that I do anything.

16:06.360 --> 16:11.360
 Every, I come to every project blank and see,

16:15.160 --> 16:19.000
 I really listen to what the artist plays and says

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
 and through what they explain, they wanna do,

16:26.880 --> 16:29.360
 help find the best way to get there.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.960
 Was it implicit in the movie

16:32.960 --> 16:37.960
 that the mean teacher liked being a mean teacher?

16:38.840 --> 16:41.440
 You said, the way you described it was

16:41.440 --> 16:43.360
 that he got off on treating people this way.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.560
 Do we know that to be the case?

16:44.560 --> 16:45.880
 I don't remember that in the movie.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.960
 But we sometimes project that onto people,

16:47.960 --> 16:52.240
 people who are really rough on students.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.120
 You start to think, well, maybe,

16:58.760 --> 17:01.040
 maybe that is fundamentally who they are.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.520
 And if it's fundamentally who they are,

17:03.520 --> 17:05.200
 that there must be some pleasure in it

17:05.200 --> 17:07.480
 or it's an addiction of some sort.

17:07.480 --> 17:12.480
 But it could be also a deliberate choice made by the teacher.

17:12.480 --> 17:16.560
 It also could be a lineage, like in the Zen tradition,

17:16.560 --> 17:21.560
 they're sort of the mean Roshis who,

17:21.920 --> 17:25.920
 if you do something wrong, take a physical action.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.560
 And it's just in the lineage,

17:29.560 --> 17:32.760
 it's considered that's how you teach.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.200
 I didn't come from that lineage,

17:36.200 --> 17:38.440
 so I'm much more of a,

17:38.440 --> 17:41.600
 I feel like it's more of a collaboration

17:41.600 --> 17:46.560
 between people working together to make the best thing.

17:46.560 --> 17:51.560
 It's not a boss, slave relationship at all.

17:51.560 --> 17:55.040
 It's much more of a, let's find our way.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.640
 And we agree at the beginning of the process

17:57.640 --> 18:02.640
 that if either of us or any of us don't like what's happening,

18:03.560 --> 18:05.760
 we say it, and the goal is to keep working

18:05.760 --> 18:09.440
 until we get to a point where we're all really happy with it.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.320
 It's like if we make something that an artist likes

18:12.320 --> 18:14.800
 and I don't like, or if that I like and they don't like,

18:14.800 --> 18:16.240
 we haven't gone far enough.

18:17.560 --> 18:21.240
 In terms of lineage, the ones that seek destruction

18:21.240 --> 18:22.520
 and the ones that seek happiness

18:22.520 --> 18:23.720
 all come from the same lineage.

18:23.720 --> 18:24.720
 Well, it came from fish.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.480
 So somewhere in you, deep down there,

18:28.480 --> 18:30.360
 there's the other stuff too.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.800
 It's just that you haven't been yet, by the way,

18:33.800 --> 18:35.280
 because you said every new project,

18:35.280 --> 18:40.280
 including maybe starting today, is an opportunity

18:40.360 --> 18:43.880
 to channel, to plug into something that was always there

18:43.880 --> 18:46.080
 and you haven't gotten a chance to plug into.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.400
 You mentioned listening.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.600
 How do you listen to a person?

18:49.600 --> 18:51.440
 How do you hear a person?

18:51.440 --> 18:54.480
 When you first come in, like we just met,

18:55.560 --> 18:57.760
 what's the analysis happening?

18:57.760 --> 18:59.800
 But I mean, with me is one thing.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.920
 I'm an artist of sorts.

19:00.920 --> 19:05.920
 I program and I'm just, I'm human, I guess.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.680
 I guess we're all creating art.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.680
 How do you see like, how do I bring out?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.640
 So for people who don't know,

19:14.800 --> 19:17.440
 I mean, obviously everyone knows that you've produced

19:17.440 --> 19:19.040
 some of the greatest records ever,

19:19.040 --> 19:24.040
 but the way I see that is you just brought out the best

19:24.960 --> 19:27.520
 in a lot of interesting artists.

19:27.520 --> 19:31.200
 And so in order to bring out the best in them,

19:31.200 --> 19:33.520
 you have to understand them.

19:33.520 --> 19:38.080
 You have to hear the music of their soul,

19:38.080 --> 19:39.760
 hopefully not being too romantic here,

19:39.760 --> 19:44.200
 but just like, is there something you can say

19:45.560 --> 19:48.560
 of how difficult that is, if there's a process,

19:48.560 --> 19:51.600
 if there's tricks, if it's luck?

19:52.800 --> 19:56.200
 I think it starts with this, again, coming in blank,

19:56.200 --> 20:00.520
 like not having any preconceived ideas being open

20:00.520 --> 20:04.360
 and really listening, listening and not thinking

20:04.360 --> 20:05.920
 about what you're gonna say next

20:05.920 --> 20:08.080
 or what your opinion is or any, you know,

20:08.080 --> 20:11.960
 not basically being a recorder

20:11.960 --> 20:14.000
 and just hearing what comes in.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.120
 And then once you hear what comes in,

20:16.120 --> 20:20.960
 processing that information and trying our best

20:20.960 --> 20:24.240
 to do that without any of the beliefs

20:24.240 --> 20:28.240
 that we might have to impact what that is.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.400
 You know, if I ask you a question,

20:30.400 --> 20:34.080
 I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna listen to you

20:34.080 --> 20:37.960
 and have any reaction happening when you're speaking

20:37.960 --> 20:41.080
 and wanna be as neutral as possible.

20:41.080 --> 20:46.080
 For me, my goal is not to form an opinion,

20:46.920 --> 20:48.880
 it's to understand.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.400
 So if anything, I would draw you out further

20:52.400 --> 20:55.920
 and just ask questions to really understand.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.640
 And if you, or if you say something that I,

21:01.080 --> 21:04.920
 that somehow triggers me in a way that that's a,

21:04.920 --> 21:08.200
 you know, I wonder how he came to that.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.480
 I would ask, I wouldn't challenge you.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.480
 I would ask like, how did you find that?

21:12.480 --> 21:14.880
 You know, how did you get to that place?

21:14.880 --> 21:16.360
 Form a place of curiosity.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.320
 You would try to figure out.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.360
 Yeah, I wanna understand who the person is

21:20.360 --> 21:22.680
 and through questioning, we can usually get there

21:22.680 --> 21:26.240
 or through just spending time together.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.280
 You find out who the person is.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.760
 What about finding out and figuring out

21:31.760 --> 21:33.520
 how to then take the next steps

21:33.520 --> 21:36.080
 of bringing out the best in them?

21:37.800 --> 21:40.040
 Like, is it just trial and error?

21:40.040 --> 21:41.280
 Like, let's try this.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.840
 It's definitely trial and error.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.240
 It's always trial and error.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.720
 Are you afraid of making a mistake?

21:46.720 --> 21:48.760
 Like, let's add this instrument,

21:48.760 --> 21:50.440
 let's remove this instrument.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.520
 Let's add this line, let's remove this line.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.360
 Let's try.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.400
 And let's, let's be open.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.800
 So one of the, one of the rules there,

21:58.800 --> 21:59.840
 we don't really have rules,

21:59.840 --> 22:03.000
 but one of the agreements in the studio is

22:03.000 --> 22:07.840
 any idea that anyone has will always demonstrate it.

22:07.840 --> 22:12.000
 We'll always try it because I can describe to you an idea

22:12.000 --> 22:14.520
 and you can think that's terrible idea.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.400
 Let's not do that.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.080
 And then I can play you the idea.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.600
 And then you can say, oh, that's really good.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.800
 And it's completely different.

22:20.800 --> 22:25.120
 Because we, when we hear, when we're told something,

22:25.120 --> 22:28.880
 we have to imagine what that is.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.000
 And the way you see something and imagine it,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.320
 and the way I see something and imagine it

22:32.320 --> 22:33.520
 are completely different.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.440
 So you say a thing and now there's two humans

22:36.440 --> 22:39.240
 that play that thing in their mind differently

22:39.240 --> 22:40.760
 in their imagination.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.080
 And then there's a cool creative step.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.680
 And when you actually do it,

22:44.680 --> 22:46.680
 to see how it differs in the imagination.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.240
 And then the difference or the commonality

22:49.240 --> 22:52.080
 will be like an exciting little discovery together.

22:52.080 --> 22:56.040
 Well, so many groups of people making things together

22:56.040 --> 22:59.240
 in a room, one person will suggest something

22:59.240 --> 23:00.200
 and someone else in the room say,

23:00.200 --> 23:01.840
 ah, that doesn't sound like a good idea.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.680
 Let's not do that.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.680
 And then they move on.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.840
 The testing of every idea is really important.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.800
 And that's how you get to see,

23:09.800 --> 23:11.680
 oh, that's not at all what I thought it was gonna be.

23:11.680 --> 23:12.840
 Happens to me all the time.

23:12.840 --> 23:15.680
 I know because someone will suggest,

23:15.680 --> 23:16.800
 why don't we do it like this?

23:16.800 --> 23:19.800
 And I'll think that sounds bad.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.320
 And then I'll think, okay, let's try it.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.160
 And then we hear it.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.560
 And then eight times out of 10,

23:24.560 --> 23:26.680
 it's nothing like I imagined and great.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.600
 And you try not to have an ego about the fact

23:30.600 --> 23:33.600
 that you thought it was not a good idea in your head.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.880
 There can't be any ego in this.

23:36.880 --> 23:37.720
 It doesn't,

23:39.680 --> 23:43.960
 if everyone's there with the purpose

23:43.960 --> 23:45.800
 of making the best thing we can,

23:48.000 --> 23:49.240
 there's nothing else.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.960
 There can't be any boundaries to that.

23:53.560 --> 23:56.040
 So there's a moment I saw with,

23:56.040 --> 23:58.200
 I know you don't love talking

23:58.200 --> 24:00.880
 about previous things you've done,

24:00.880 --> 24:02.280
 but it's cool to dive in there.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.080
 I'm fine to talk with maybe.

24:04.080 --> 24:04.920
 To sample it.

24:05.800 --> 24:06.920
 Anything?

24:06.920 --> 24:08.200
 Well, I have this pain.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.040
 I gotta talk not.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.520
 I'll think of something ridiculous

24:12.520 --> 24:14.920
 that would make you change your mind.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.880
 You mentioned, I saw a video of you with Jay Z

24:19.880 --> 24:21.120
 looking on 99 Problems

24:21.120 --> 24:23.400
 where you suggested acapella

24:23.400 --> 24:25.400
 opening the song with acapella.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.160
 Just no instruments, just voice.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.800
 That to me, I mean,

24:29.800 --> 24:33.400
 that's one of the characteristics

24:33.400 --> 24:35.280
 of the things,

24:35.280 --> 24:37.360
 of the ways you've brought out the best an artist

24:37.360 --> 24:38.680
 is doing less.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.720
 Sort of the tending towards simplicity

24:41.720 --> 24:43.160
 in some kind of way.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.640
 So that choice of acapella is really interesting

24:45.640 --> 24:47.600
 because I could see a lot of people think

24:47.600 --> 24:49.240
 that that's a bad idea,

24:50.240 --> 24:52.320
 but it turned out to be a really powerful idea.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.440
 Can you maybe talk about the simplicity?

24:55.440 --> 24:56.720
 How to find simplicity?

24:56.720 --> 24:58.920
 Why you find simplicity is beautiful.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.840
 It does appear to be beautiful.

25:00.840 --> 25:01.880
 What is that?

25:01.880 --> 25:03.840
 Yeah, I don't know where it comes from.

25:03.840 --> 25:07.440
 It has been with me from the beginning of my work.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.840
 The very first album I ever produced,

25:10.840 --> 25:12.840
 the credit I took was reduced by me

25:12.840 --> 25:16.120
 instead of produced by me for that reason.

25:16.120 --> 25:19.520
 Like I like the idea of getting to the essential

25:19.520 --> 25:23.520
 and I have a better idea now

25:23.520 --> 25:24.600
 that I've done it for a while,

25:24.600 --> 25:28.920
 but at the time it was purely an instinctual thing.

25:28.920 --> 25:31.320
 And part of it is a sonic,

25:31.320 --> 25:33.120
 there's a sonic benefit,

25:33.120 --> 25:36.440
 which is the less elements you have,

25:36.440 --> 25:40.880
 you can hear each of the ones that are there

25:40.880 --> 25:42.880
 and they can sound better.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.240
 And the less there are,

25:44.240 --> 25:47.640
 the more space they could have around them

25:47.640 --> 25:49.880
 and the more you can hear their personality.

25:49.880 --> 25:54.880
 If you were to record 10 people playing the same guitar part

25:55.400 --> 25:58.680
 and you listen to it, it would sound like guitar.

25:58.680 --> 26:02.720
 And if you record one person playing a guitar part,

26:02.720 --> 26:05.560
 it sounds like a person playing the guitar.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.400
 It's different than just guitar.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.880
 And often in the studio,

26:11.880 --> 26:14.480
 the idea of building upon things

26:14.480 --> 26:18.440
 and adding layers to thicken, to make it sound bigger,

26:18.440 --> 26:23.440
 sometimes the more things you add, the smaller it gets.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.480
 So it's a lot of it is counterintuitive

26:27.480 --> 26:31.040
 until you just in practice see what works.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.760
 To try it, to try removing stuff until it's just right.

26:33.760 --> 26:38.760
 It's the Einstein thing, make it as simple as possible,

26:39.280 --> 26:40.840
 but not simpler.

26:40.840 --> 26:44.480
 That's such a, like finding a stopping place,

26:44.480 --> 26:47.480
 just keep chopping away and chopping away.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.600
 Yeah, there's something we also like to do

26:49.600 --> 26:51.480
 called the Ruthless Edit, which is,

26:51.480 --> 26:55.120
 let's say you're at a point where it can work for anything,

26:55.120 --> 26:57.280
 but I'll give you the example with an album.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.600
 We've recorded 25 songs.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.120
 We think the album's gonna have 10.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.080
 Instead of picking our favorite 10,

27:08.080 --> 27:11.920
 we limit it to what are the five or six

27:11.920 --> 27:13.200
 that we can't live without.

27:14.320 --> 27:18.520
 So going past even the goal

27:18.520 --> 27:20.800
 to get to the real like heart of it

27:20.800 --> 27:22.520
 and then see, okay, we have these five or six

27:22.520 --> 27:24.280
 that we can't live without.

27:24.280 --> 27:28.240
 Now, what would we add to that?

27:28.240 --> 27:31.240
 That makes it better and not worse.

27:31.240 --> 27:36.240
 And it's just, it puts you in a different frame

27:38.560 --> 27:42.840
 when you start with building instead of removing.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.400
 And you might find that there's nothing you need to add.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.880
 Sometimes, sometimes something happens

27:48.880 --> 27:51.360
 when you get to the real essence.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.720
 Then when you start adding things back,

27:52.720 --> 27:57.720
 it becomes clear that it was just supposed to be this,

27:58.040 --> 27:59.200
 this tight little thing.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.240
 Can I ask you like a therapy session question?

28:02.240 --> 28:05.680
 So I'd like, you mentioned somewhere that one way

28:05.680 --> 28:09.960
 to kind of think about music to get into music

28:09.960 --> 28:12.960
 is to look at the top like hundred albums of all time

28:12.960 --> 28:15.000
 and just go down the list and like,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.680
 just take it all in like a one piece of artwork.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.120
 So I was doing that for a while.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.560
 It's a cool experiment.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.440
 Cause unfortunately I have to admit,

28:23.440 --> 28:29.380
 I've gotten lazy and stopped taking in albums as albums.

28:29.380 --> 28:32.640
 And I looked at one interesting top hundred,

28:32.640 --> 28:33.760
 let's top 500 actually,

28:33.760 --> 28:36.920
 which is put together by Rolling Stone.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.840
 And they put, this is the therapy session part.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.320
 And this has to do with simplicity too.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.160
 They put Marvin Gaye's What's Going On at number one,

28:44.160 --> 28:45.000
 spoiler alert.

28:46.120 --> 28:50.760
 So I'd like to maybe get your opinion on that choice.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.720
 The reason Marvin Gaye is really interesting,

28:53.720 --> 28:57.760
 it'd actually be cool to play what's going on in a second.

28:57.760 --> 29:02.640
 But when you just listen to his like acapella,

29:02.640 --> 29:06.080
 just listen to his voice, it is really good.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.600
 Like people, it makes me wonder if it's possible

29:09.600 --> 29:13.200
 to pull off like most of his songs with no instruments.

29:13.200 --> 29:17.800
 Like in many parts, there's so much soul

29:17.800 --> 29:21.840
 in just Mercy, Mercy Me, What's Going On.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.680
 There's so many songs that you could just be like,

29:23.680 --> 29:28.160
 I wonder if you could just like, just go raw.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.360
 Or maybe in parts, or maybe do what you do with Jay Z,

29:30.360 --> 29:31.440
 just open up with nothing.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.760
 Anyway, there's something so powerful

29:33.760 --> 29:36.080
 with a great soulful voice.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.800
 Do you mind if I play it real quick?

29:37.800 --> 29:38.640
 No, please.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.480
 What's going on?

29:39.480 --> 29:41.360
 This is probably one of my favorite songs.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.360
 I mean, it's up there.

29:42.360 --> 29:48.360
 Yeah, what's happening?

29:48.360 --> 29:50.360
 This is a great party, man.

29:50.360 --> 30:00.360
 Yeah, I'm gonna like this song right now.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.360
 That voice.

30:02.360 --> 30:08.360
 There's too many of you crying.

30:08.360 --> 30:30.080
 There's some just very subtle backing vocals.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.080
 This one hurts.

30:31.080 --> 30:47.080
 I wonder who the father he's talking about is.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.080
 Oh, that's interesting.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.520
 I mean, I have, so for people who don't know his own father

30:51.520 --> 30:55.080
 ended up killing Marvin Gaye.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.080
 Yeah.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.720
 I mean, that one is really, I mean, for a lot of people,

30:59.720 --> 31:01.720
 for a relationship with your father,

31:01.720 --> 31:03.160
 I mean, there's different dynamics,

31:03.160 --> 31:06.080
 but it's almost like part of life is resolving

31:06.080 --> 31:08.840
 some kind of complex puzzle you have

31:08.840 --> 31:10.920
 with the people you love, the people close to you,

31:10.920 --> 31:14.320
 or the people who are not there, all those kinds of things.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.800
 That's so much pain in that we don't need to escalate

31:16.800 --> 31:17.880
 father to father.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.800
 I never thought if it's,

31:19.800 --> 31:22.120
 I always thought it's his father directly.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.200
 Yeah, I don't get that.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.760
 It could be, but I don't,

31:24.760 --> 31:33.760
 I feel like it's a more masculine spirituality.

31:33.760 --> 31:37.320
 Like a father figure or just broadly some kind of spirituality.

31:37.320 --> 31:41.560
 Could be like God, father God, mother God,

31:41.560 --> 31:44.120
 you know, like could be, I don't know.

31:44.120 --> 31:49.720
 But there's so much, it's like both hope and melancholy.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.160
 You're saying war is not the answer.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.880
 It's like you don't tell your father war is not,

31:53.880 --> 31:56.320
 or blood father war is not the answer.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.240
 It's strange conversation.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.000
 So it's a bigger conversation than a personal.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.360
 Don't you think it feels like war when it's personal?

32:05.360 --> 32:06.920
 What's the difference between,

32:08.760 --> 32:11.040
 is the war is personal too.

32:11.040 --> 32:14.840
 It's only leaders think about war in a geopolitical sense.

32:14.840 --> 32:18.680
 When people that fight wars, you lose your brothers.

32:18.680 --> 32:21.480
 You lose, I mean, death is just right there.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.680
 So it might feel just like that.

32:22.680 --> 32:26.360
 But yeah, there is a dance between like the personal

32:26.360 --> 32:28.640
 and like talking to the entirety of the society.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.520
 It's like John Lennon and Imagine.

32:30.520 --> 32:36.880
 Like also a song where, is that hopeful?

32:36.880 --> 32:39.080
 Is that cynical?

32:39.080 --> 32:43.480
 Is it like melancholy, like heartbroken?

32:43.480 --> 32:47.000
 Like you hope you wish things would be a certain way

32:47.000 --> 32:48.840
 and they're not.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.680
 Yeah, I don't know.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.800
 John Lennon is giving up on the world in Imagine.

32:52.800 --> 32:53.760
 Yeah, I don't know.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.520
 I know it's an interesting question.

32:55.520 --> 33:00.520
 There's another John Lennon lyric in,

33:02.560 --> 33:03.400
 let me think of what it is.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.480
 Take me a second.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.440
 And different songs keep coming into my head.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.160
 It's not the one that I'm looking for.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.320
 Keep pressing next.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.320
 Um,

33:18.760 --> 33:20.080
 across the universe,

33:21.520 --> 33:23.200
 nothing's gonna change my world.

33:25.120 --> 33:28.160
 And when I hear that,

33:29.480 --> 33:31.000
 I hear it as hopeless.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
 But I don't think, I don't believe that that's,

33:36.080 --> 33:37.960
 well, it may be how he meant it,

33:37.960 --> 33:40.480
 but I don't think that's how it's normally taken.

33:40.480 --> 33:45.480
 And it's also the taker is important.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.600
 I'm generally optimistic and hopeful.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.800
 So I always like look for the hope

33:49.800 --> 33:54.240
 and actually the harshest love heartbreak songs

33:54.240 --> 33:56.080
 are always somehow hopeful to me.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.240
 That's a love song.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.800
 To me, like a song about losing love

34:02.760 --> 34:06.440
 is a song about the great capacity for love

34:06.440 --> 34:07.600
 in the human heart.

34:07.600 --> 34:08.680
 That's what I hear.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.760
 But to me, losing love is exciting.

34:12.440 --> 34:15.040
 Cause it's like, that means you really cared.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.200
 That means you felt something and you feel something.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.480
 You can sit in that pain

34:18.480 --> 34:21.680
 and that pain is a reminder of what it means to be human.

34:21.680 --> 34:22.520
 When you're that,

34:23.760 --> 34:24.600
 what is it?

34:25.840 --> 34:27.800
 We're just listening.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.160
 The only man who could have reached me

34:29.160 --> 34:30.440
 was a son of a preacher man.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.040
 So it's like that early love or something

34:33.040 --> 34:35.000
 or partially sexual or whatever.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.440
 That's not as interesting to me.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.280
 It's fun.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.120
 It's great.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.200
 It's that heartbreak.

34:39.200 --> 34:41.320
 That's a reminder they can go deep.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.080
 Although that's a damn good song.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.200
 Have you ever heard the Detroit mix

34:46.200 --> 34:48.200
 of the Marvin Gaye album?

34:48.200 --> 34:49.040
 No.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.120
 Call it up.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.880
 By far better.

34:54.880 --> 34:55.720
 Mind blowing.

34:55.720 --> 34:56.560
 I just heard it recently.

34:56.560 --> 34:57.400
 It blew my mind.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.080
 Oh wow.

35:04.080 --> 35:04.920
 Reverb.

35:04.920 --> 35:08.240
 Distant.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.080
 Mother, mother.

35:11.080 --> 35:11.920
 Interesting.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.920
 There's too many love you to cry.

35:18.040 --> 35:21.040
 Brother, brother, brother.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.600
 There's far too many love you to die.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.440
 Feels like it's all around the room more.

35:26.440 --> 35:31.000
 I know we've got to find a way

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
 to bring some love in here today.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.400
 More voices.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.400
 More voices.

35:40.400 --> 35:45.400
 I don't want you to escalate.

35:45.400 --> 35:49.400
 I see war is not the answer.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.200
 For all in love can't.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.200
 He's layering his own vocals.

35:54.200 --> 35:59.400
 You know we've got to find a way

35:59.400 --> 36:03.400
 to bring some love in here today.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.400
 Feels like there's multiple people singing.

36:09.400 --> 36:14.400
 Don't punish me with brutality.

36:14.400 --> 36:18.400
 Talk to me so you can see.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.400
 Oh, what's going on?

36:20.400 --> 36:21.400
 What's going on?

36:21.400 --> 36:22.400
 That's beautiful.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.400
 It seems to have more energy.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.400
 If you listen to the whole album,

36:26.400 --> 36:29.200
 even though you just said you don't listen to albums anymore,

36:29.200 --> 36:34.200
 the Detroit mix of the whole album changes the album a lot.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.200
 I mean that felt...

36:36.200 --> 36:39.200
 So that's the opposite of acapella, I would say.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.200
 Because it's...

36:42.200 --> 36:44.200
 There's layers.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.200
 And maybe...

36:46.200 --> 36:48.200
 I don't know if you remember,

36:48.200 --> 36:51.200
 but if memory says me correct here,

36:51.200 --> 36:53.200
 he produces this own album here.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.200
 Marvin Gaye was the producer on this, I believe.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.200
 I believe so.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.200
 This one sounds more like it's a get together.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.200
 And the whole album sounds more like a get together,

37:02.200 --> 37:06.200
 where it's a group of people in a room playing music together.

37:06.200 --> 37:12.200
 Whereas the album version sounds more like an out, like a recording.

37:12.200 --> 37:15.200
 This sounds less like a recording and a little more like a party.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.200
 Now you had a series of conversations with Paul McCartney,

37:18.200 --> 37:21.200
 which is amazing that people should watch.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.200
 But is there...

37:23.200 --> 37:25.200
 This is continuing our therapy session.

37:25.200 --> 37:30.200
 There's a case to be made that what's going on is the number one album

37:30.200 --> 37:35.200
 above the Beatles white album or Abbey Road above Pat Sounds.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.200
 Can you still manage the case?

37:38.200 --> 37:40.200
 There's always a case.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.200
 I mean, there's always a case.

37:42.200 --> 37:48.200
 In reality, in art, there is no metric that makes sense.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.200
 So you could put numbers on things,

37:51.200 --> 37:55.200
 it's like, is this apple better than this peach?

37:55.200 --> 37:59.200
 It's not really a fair comparison.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.200
 But if you just had to keep one to represent the human species,

38:02.200 --> 38:05.200
 that's the way I think to the aliens.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.200
 So I think it's a very personal decision.

38:07.200 --> 38:11.200
 I think you can make your choice to represent the human species,

38:11.200 --> 38:13.200
 and I'll make mine, you know?

38:13.200 --> 38:16.200
 Well, I would pick the Beatles over Beach Boys.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.200
 So that's my...

38:17.200 --> 38:20.200
 If I became dictator of the world, I was talking to the aliens.

38:20.200 --> 38:24.200
 But I don't know the full historical context to the impact of the music.

38:24.200 --> 38:29.200
 I don't know if that's something to consider like this kind of thought experiment

38:29.200 --> 38:35.200
 of imagine what it was like back then to create, to go into the studio,

38:35.200 --> 38:39.200
 to do such interesting work in the studio,

38:39.200 --> 38:44.200
 as opposed to like listening to just as a pop song almost from...

38:44.200 --> 38:49.200
 Because I've never been able to understand Beach Boys.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.200
 God Only Knows.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.200
 The song God Only Knows?

38:53.200 --> 38:56.200
 God Only Knows, but all of it, the album, the Pet Sounds just...

38:56.200 --> 38:58.200
 In my room?

38:58.200 --> 39:00.200
 In my room?

39:00.200 --> 39:02.200
 That song?

39:02.200 --> 39:04.200
 What was your favorite on the album?

39:04.200 --> 39:06.200
 On the Pet Sounds album?

39:06.200 --> 39:07.200
 Pet Sounds.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.200
 The opening track.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.200
 Do you mind if I play it?

39:10.200 --> 39:13.200
 Please.

39:13.200 --> 39:17.200
 It's too fun.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.200
 That's part of their trip, though.

39:20.200 --> 39:26.200
 You open the heart of the fun?

39:26.200 --> 39:29.200
 It's possible.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.200
 Original mono and stereo mix versions.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.200
 What's the opening song?

39:34.200 --> 39:35.200
 Wouldn't it be nice?

39:35.200 --> 39:48.200
 Yeah, that's the song.

40:07.200 --> 40:11.200
 This part is good, man.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.200
 And then back to fun.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.200
 Yeah, that we could say goodnight and stay together.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.200
 Wouldn't that be nice?

40:17.200 --> 40:19.200
 Wouldn't it be nice to wake up together?

40:19.200 --> 40:21.200
 But we're not.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.200
 There's heartbreak in this one, too.

40:24.200 --> 40:27.200
 Still, to me, like George Harris, like,

40:27.200 --> 40:32.200
 is that the whiteback album while my guitar gently weeps?

40:32.200 --> 40:37.200
 I mean, that the Beatles, it's so hard to,

40:37.200 --> 40:40.200
 depending on the day, I'll say a very different song.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.200
 That's my favorite song.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.200
 But I often return to while my guitar gently weeps

40:44.200 --> 40:45.200
 is my favorite song.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.200
 It's spectacular.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.200
 It's spectacular.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.200
 And anything George Harrison, honestly, something,

40:49.200 --> 40:53.200
 something in the way she moves.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.200
 What would you classify that?

40:54.200 --> 40:57.200
 There's like several Beatles songs, categories of Beatles songs.

40:57.200 --> 41:03.200
 So that's like the melancholy love songs or ballads or something like that.

41:03.200 --> 41:06.200
 Yesterday, let it be.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.200
 What's, do you have favorites?

41:08.200 --> 41:11.200
 So from your, like, how have you changed as a man,

41:11.200 --> 41:15.200
 as a human being, as a musician and music producer ever having done

41:15.200 --> 41:21.200
 that lengthy interaction with McCartney?

41:21.200 --> 41:28.200
 Any time you're around someone who's such a hero and you spend time with them

41:28.200 --> 41:32.200
 and they're a human being, it helps put perspective on everything.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.200
 Although they're just human.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.200
 Well, obviously.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.200
 I mean, every, everyone's just human.

41:37.200 --> 41:42.200
 And, but I remember the first time I got to see Paul McCartney play live,

41:42.200 --> 41:48.200
 it was in a stadium of 70,000 people and he started playing and I started crying.

41:48.200 --> 41:52.200
 And I couldn't believe I was in, even with 70,000 people,

41:52.200 --> 41:58.200
 I couldn't believe that this man walks the earth and that I'm in the same place as him.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.200
 And he's the person who wrote that and played that.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.200
 And now he's here playing it for us.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.200
 It's mind blowing.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.200
 That's the voice.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.200
 That's the, it's overwhelming.

42:11.200 --> 42:17.200
 Is it inspiring or is it like,

42:17.200 --> 42:21.200
 because sometimes when you have, and I've gotten a chance to me,

42:21.200 --> 42:23.200
 I mean, I love people in general.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.200
 Like every, every person is fascinating to me.

42:25.200 --> 42:29.200
 But yeah, when you've been a fan for a long time and you meet a person,

42:29.200 --> 42:36.200
 sort of, I'll just remove present company is you,

42:36.200 --> 42:39.200
 it's like, oh, they're just human.

42:39.200 --> 42:40.200
 So there's both.

42:40.200 --> 42:45.200
 It's both inspiring that just a simple human can achieve such beautiful things.

42:45.200 --> 42:51.200
 But it's also like almost wishing there were gods moving around us.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.200
 It's somehow peaceful.

42:53.200 --> 43:00.200
 It's more comforting to know that there's, you know, there's bigger fish.

43:00.200 --> 43:06.200
 I'm just a small fish and then there's bigger fish and it will take care of the ocean for us.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.200
 I think we're all capable of being big fish.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.200
 I don't think that there are special people.

43:11.200 --> 43:14.200
 I don't think it's like that.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.200
 I would make a case.

43:16.200 --> 43:22.200
 So the variety of artists that you worked with and brought the best out of,

43:22.200 --> 43:27.200
 it does seem the year out of this world.

43:27.200 --> 43:36.200
 So do you think you would know, like, if you're the same kind of species,

43:36.200 --> 43:41.200
 maybe you're just a meat vehicle and you're channeling ideas from somewhere else.

43:41.200 --> 43:44.200
 I feel like I'm channeling ideas from somewhere else 100%.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.200
 But I think...

43:45.200 --> 43:47.200
 Have you asked questions about where from?

43:47.200 --> 43:49.200
 I believe we all are, though.

43:49.200 --> 43:59.200
 You know, I believe we are vehicles for information that when it's ready to come through,

43:59.200 --> 44:03.200
 it comes through and the people who have good antennas pick up the signal.

44:03.200 --> 44:09.200
 But if I'm sure you've had an experience in your life where you've had an idea for something

44:09.200 --> 44:13.200
 and you've not acted on it and eventually someone else does it.

44:13.200 --> 44:17.200
 And it's not because they're doing it because you had the idea and they stole your idea.

44:17.200 --> 44:21.200
 It's because the time has come for that idea.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.200
 And if you don't do it, someone else is going to do it.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.200
 It's being broadcast by whatever the source is.

44:25.200 --> 44:27.200
 Whatever the source is.

44:27.200 --> 44:33.200
 Yeah, I tend to see humans as not quite special in that way.

44:33.200 --> 44:37.200
 Yeah, it's different kinds of antennas walking around listening to ideas.

44:37.200 --> 44:39.200
 And ideas that are...

44:39.200 --> 44:43.200
 I like the notion of Richard Dawkins of memes.

44:43.200 --> 44:46.200
 It's kind of the ideas of the organisms.

44:46.200 --> 44:53.200
 And they're just using our brains to multiply, to select, to compete, to evolve.

44:53.200 --> 44:57.200
 And humans, we really want to hold on to the specialness of our body, of our mind.

44:57.200 --> 44:59.200
 But it's really the ideas.

44:59.200 --> 45:05.200
 So if a group was born two centuries ago, you wouldn't be a music producer.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.200
 I mean, maybe.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.200
 But you have an antenna.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.200
 Yeah.

45:11.200 --> 45:17.200
 And if no signal is coming in, or you'd be hearing potentially a different signal.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.200
 Is there...

45:19.200 --> 45:23.200
 I think we all have our own antenna for whatever it is that we...

45:23.200 --> 45:31.200
 Maybe not everyone has tuned into their antenna to see what it is that their strength in bringing through is.

45:31.200 --> 45:35.200
 I'm lucky in that it found me, because I didn't know that it was a...

45:35.200 --> 45:37.200
 I didn't even know this was a job.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.200
 I sometimes wonder...

45:39.200 --> 45:49.200
 I mean, a lot of young people, a lot of people wonder, like, what's the purpose and the specs of my antenna?

45:49.200 --> 45:53.200
 What am I put on this earth to do?

45:53.200 --> 46:01.200
 Like, if I can live a thousand lives, there's so many trajectories.

46:01.200 --> 46:09.200
 And imagine the greatest possible trajectory that reveals the most beautiful thing I can possibly create in this world.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.200
 Live the most beautiful way.

46:11.200 --> 46:13.200
 What is that?

46:13.200 --> 46:17.200
 I feel like that's a good exercise to think about.

46:17.200 --> 46:21.200
 Because it's also liberating to think that you can do anything.

46:21.200 --> 46:23.200
 I mean, that...

46:23.200 --> 46:25.200
 More and more...

46:25.200 --> 46:27.200
 I suppose that's kind of life.

46:27.200 --> 46:29.200
 It's like society is pushing conformity on you.

46:29.200 --> 46:31.200
 You know, I thought...

46:31.200 --> 46:33.200
 I had my own flavor of conformity.

46:33.200 --> 46:35.200
 I thought I was supposed to be following.

46:35.200 --> 46:41.200
 And then early on, I would say, in the late 20s, you realized, wait a minute.

46:41.200 --> 46:45.200
 You don't have to do what teachers tell you to do.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.200
 What parents tell you to do.

46:47.200 --> 46:49.200
 What society tells you to do.

46:49.200 --> 47:05.200
 And I would never wear a suit if I listened to my colleagues in the community who think a suit is the symbol of conformity, which is hilarious.

47:05.200 --> 47:13.200
 But it's actually a kind of rebellion and everything else of that nature doing these silly podcasts.

47:13.200 --> 47:17.200
 I have a question I have to ask.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.200
 Because you brought up the suit.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.200
 Do you wear the suit?

47:21.200 --> 47:25.200
 Is this your daily uniform outside of podcasting?

47:25.200 --> 47:29.200
 So for the longest time, it was some kind of suit.

47:29.200 --> 47:35.200
 And then recently, coinciding with going to Texas, there's a...

47:35.200 --> 47:37.200
 I'm such a loner.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.200
 I'm an introvert.

47:39.200 --> 47:45.200
 And there's a bit of a hiding from the world when I wear other stuff.

47:45.200 --> 47:57.200
 I really want to not make fame, recognition, money, all of those things, a motivation at all.

47:57.200 --> 48:01.200
 And the world kind of wants you to make those motivations.

48:01.200 --> 48:09.200
 Not the world, but I would say maybe the Western world, maybe America, maybe a capitalist system does.

48:09.200 --> 48:13.200
 That's a choice to buy into that or not.

48:13.200 --> 48:17.200
 It takes a brave person, a person of character to not buy in.

48:17.200 --> 48:21.200
 And I'm like a baby deer trying to find its legs.

48:21.200 --> 48:23.200
 You don't have to buy in.

48:23.200 --> 48:27.200
 Because I love people and I think I'm kind of an idiot.

48:27.200 --> 48:33.200
 And so when other people say, do this and do that, there is a pressure there.

48:33.200 --> 48:43.200
 It's actually very difficult to not listen necessarily to the advice of others and yet keep yourself fragile and open to the world.

48:43.200 --> 48:50.200
 It's easy to be like, I'm always right, you know, just kind of sticking your ground.

48:50.200 --> 48:57.200
 But if you want to be like vulnerable, if you want to connect with people and just wear your heart on your sleeve, then you're going to listen to them.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.200
 I mean, that's the double edged sword of it.

48:59.200 --> 49:06.200
 But then again, that pain, like if you don't let it destroy, you can grow from that.

49:06.200 --> 49:08.200
 Has fame affected you at all?

49:08.200 --> 49:11.200
 Did you unplug from the system at some point?

49:11.200 --> 49:14.200
 Same. I've always been sort of removed.

49:14.200 --> 49:17.200
 I don't feel like I'm part of any system.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.200
 Do you feel famous?

49:20.200 --> 49:27.200
 I'm aware that when I go out, people say nice things to me, which is great.

49:27.200 --> 49:30.200
 But that's about it. That's about as far as it goes.

49:30.200 --> 49:33.200
 But it doesn't affect your art about your creativity or your thoughts.

49:33.200 --> 49:36.200
 Like when you're sitting alone and thinking about the world.

49:36.200 --> 49:40.200
 It can't. It can't. It's a destructive force.

49:40.200 --> 49:52.200
 The reason that you're who you are and the reason that you're finding the success you're finding is because you've been true to yourself to get to that stage.

49:52.200 --> 50:04.200
 So to start changing that, to either conform to someone else's idea of what you should be doing, it just seems like it doesn't make sense.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.200
 Do you have a sense of who you are?

50:06.200 --> 50:08.200
 Because I don't necessarily have a...

50:08.200 --> 50:20.200
 I don't know. I know that I really like making good things and I know that I'm crazy about it in that it's like an obsession.

50:20.200 --> 50:23.200
 And I want things to be as good as they could be, whatever it is.

50:23.200 --> 50:33.200
 And if I finish a music project and I have a window of time where I'm not working on music, I might be moving the furniture around in the house.

50:33.200 --> 50:41.200
 You know, I'm always looking for a creative outlet to find a way to make something better.

50:41.200 --> 50:52.200
 Or there was a period of time where I was in a weird corporate situation that didn't allow me to flourish.

50:52.200 --> 50:59.200
 And I focused the creativity in on myself and I lost a bunch of weight and changed my life.

50:59.200 --> 51:05.200
 So that was the kind of art, like you've gone through a whole process of losing weight, getting in shape, getting healthy.

51:05.200 --> 51:07.200
 That was a kind of creative act.

51:07.200 --> 51:13.200
 It certainly was. It wasn't an intentional creative act, but I had a lot of energy and I just...

51:13.200 --> 51:16.200
 A series of events happened.

51:16.200 --> 51:21.200
 I read a book. At the time, that was my heaviest. I weighed about 318 pounds.

51:21.200 --> 51:26.200
 And I'd never been... I'd been sedentary my whole life basically laying on a couch working on music.

51:26.200 --> 51:30.200
 So I've never been physically active in my life.

51:30.200 --> 51:37.200
 And I read a book about a guy named Stu Middleman, a runner, who ran 1,000 miles in 11 days.

51:37.200 --> 51:41.200
 And I thought, wow, I get out of breath walking to the corner.

51:41.200 --> 51:47.200
 And another human being can run 1,000 miles in 11 days. I feel like I have bad information.

51:47.200 --> 51:50.200
 Clearly, I'm doing something wrong.

51:50.200 --> 51:55.200
 And I reached out to a person that Stu mentioned in the book, Phil Maffaton.

51:55.200 --> 52:00.200
 He's a legend. I really appreciate him as well. He's Maff 180 Method 2.

52:00.200 --> 52:03.200
 He's such an interesting... I think he focuses on...

52:03.200 --> 52:06.200
 Heart rate training and...

52:06.200 --> 52:12.200
 He was the first person to talk about essentially a...

52:12.200 --> 52:13.200
 Low carbs diet.

52:13.200 --> 52:17.200
 Paleo keto diet.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.200
 For a person who's healthy.

52:19.200 --> 52:25.200
 Who can exercise and actually perform at an early level.

52:25.200 --> 52:30.200
 He's the first person when I talk about heart rate training.

52:30.200 --> 52:33.200
 Him and other endurance athletes he influenced.

52:33.200 --> 52:37.200
 He gave me permission to run slower.

52:37.200 --> 52:44.200
 It's the first time I realized, oh, I can run long distances if I just run slower and then take that seriously.

52:44.200 --> 52:48.200
 And I actually fell in love with running very much so.

52:48.200 --> 52:50.200
 Because for me, everyone's different.

52:50.200 --> 52:54.200
 But for me, the love of running happens in the longer distances.

52:54.200 --> 52:56.200
 Did you read Born to Run?

52:56.200 --> 52:57.200
 Great book.

52:57.200 --> 52:58.200
 Amazing book.

52:58.200 --> 53:01.200
 There is something special about running.

53:01.200 --> 53:04.200
 Everybody has their own journey with it.

53:04.200 --> 53:08.200
 And even ultra marathon running, those kinds of things.

53:08.200 --> 53:12.200
 It is like many journeys.

53:12.200 --> 53:15.200
 One that can pull you in.

53:15.200 --> 53:18.200
 Like you won't be the same person after.

53:18.200 --> 53:26.200
 And I try to be deliberate about making choices after which you will not be the same person.

53:26.200 --> 53:32.200
 And so I'm nervous about the ultra marathon running world.

53:32.200 --> 53:37.200
 I have to talk to you about Johnny Cash.

53:37.200 --> 53:51.200
 I mean, when people ask me what my favorite musical thing is of all time.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.200
 You know, it's a very difficult question to answer, of course.

53:53.200 --> 53:59.200
 But I'm pretty quick, if I'm not allowed to pick anything by Tom Ways.

53:59.200 --> 54:06.200
 I'm pretty quick to say, hurt by Johnny Cash, the performance, whatever you call it.

54:06.200 --> 54:07.200
 Whatever the heck that is.

54:07.200 --> 54:14.200
 Because that's not just a song covered by an artist.

54:14.200 --> 54:19.200
 That's a human being at the end of their life.

54:19.200 --> 54:24.200
 The rawness of that.

54:24.200 --> 54:28.200
 There's also a music video, which for a lot of people adds a lot to it.

54:28.200 --> 54:32.200
 For me, just the music alone.

54:32.200 --> 54:36.200
 I mean, the guitar, every choice on that.

54:36.200 --> 54:41.200
 See, the few things I've heard about it, it seemed like almost accidental.

54:41.200 --> 54:44.200
 I mean, like little subtle choices here and there.

54:44.200 --> 54:49.200
 Can you maybe comment on that to the degree?

54:49.200 --> 54:56.200
 I think you had a huge role in sort of bringing Johnny Cash back from a different part of his life.

54:56.200 --> 54:59.200
 It's like bringing something out that wasn't there before.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.200
 And it was incredible.

55:02.200 --> 55:04.200
 It was a celebration of a really special musician.

55:04.200 --> 55:07.200
 And it's totally new kind of celebration.

55:07.200 --> 55:13.200
 Now, Hurt is just one of the songs that's an amazing celebration of Johnny Cash.

55:13.200 --> 55:17.200
 But Hurt is at the peak of that.

55:17.200 --> 55:21.200
 So what was that like putting that song together?

55:21.200 --> 55:26.200
 Maybe it might be nice to listen to it because I freaking love that song.

55:26.200 --> 55:33.200
 And as a guitarist, I just, the simplicity of it.

55:33.200 --> 55:38.200
 It seems like every choice contributes to the greatness of the song.

55:48.200 --> 55:52.200
 It's simple, it's crisp, but it's dark too.

55:52.200 --> 55:57.200
 It's one of the greatest opening lines of any song.

55:57.200 --> 56:00.200
 The shape of that.

56:00.200 --> 56:02.200
 Yeah, just see if I still feel it.

56:02.200 --> 56:04.200
 Yeah, I'm talking about the lyrics.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.200
 I don't even mean the performance.

56:06.200 --> 56:08.200
 The words, Hurt.

56:15.200 --> 56:18.200
 But those words out of Trent and Resner are not the same.

56:18.200 --> 56:22.200
 They have a different meaning coming out of Johnny Cash's mouth.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.200
 What have I become?

56:42.200 --> 56:45.200
 Written probably for a young man.

56:45.200 --> 56:49.200
 I think he was 20 when he wrote it, Trent.

56:49.200 --> 57:02.200
 Anger, regret, pain.

57:02.200 --> 57:06.200
 Anger, regret, pain.

57:18.200 --> 57:23.200
 The way the guitarist played the choice of instrument, the layers there,

57:23.200 --> 57:31.200
 the freedom to give him, to use the voice that's fading.

57:31.200 --> 57:33.200
 It's not fading, it's changing.

57:33.200 --> 57:38.200
 Maybe he's losing some aspects of his voice.

57:38.200 --> 57:46.200
 It's almost like shaking a little bit, and it's a little bit out of tune in parts.

57:49.200 --> 57:51.200
 How much of that was deliberate?

57:51.200 --> 57:55.200
 How much was, like, how do you give Johnny Cash the freedom to do that?

57:55.200 --> 57:57.200
 How do you find that together?

57:57.200 --> 57:59.200
 Is there any insights you can give?

57:59.200 --> 58:09.200
 I think it's a case almost of, like, the right pairing, the right role with the right actor, you could say.

58:09.200 --> 58:17.200
 The song lyrics, the reason we chose the song was because of the lyrics, purely about the lyrics.

58:17.200 --> 58:23.200
 And at that point in time, both Johnny and I would send each other songs of possible ideas to record,

58:23.200 --> 58:28.200
 and that was one that I sent him, and he didn't respond to initially.

58:28.200 --> 58:34.200
 I would send him, at that time, he would burn CDs, and I would send him, like, CD of 20 songs or 25 songs,

58:34.200 --> 58:36.200
 and then he would send them to me.

58:36.200 --> 58:39.200
 He'd burn a CD for Johnny Cash, and he'd send him off different songs.

58:39.200 --> 58:46.200
 Songs to consider recording, and we would send these back and forth.

58:46.200 --> 58:51.200
 And then I had hurt on one of the ones that I sent him, and he didn't respond to him.

58:51.200 --> 58:56.200
 Usually, if he didn't respond, we didn't go back to it.

58:56.200 --> 59:03.200
 And that one, I remember, I sent it again, and I put it first on the next CD.

59:03.200 --> 59:07.200
 And when we spoke about when he listened to the CD again, he didn't respond.

59:07.200 --> 59:09.200
 I said, check out that first song again.

59:09.200 --> 59:11.200
 I really feel like that one could be good.

59:11.200 --> 59:12.200
 What did you see in that song?

59:12.200 --> 59:14.200
 It's the lyrics.

59:14.200 --> 59:15.200
 It's the lyrics.

59:15.200 --> 59:28.200
 Because I feel like there's very few people in the world that would see these lyrics in Johnny Cash's mouth and think this is a good idea, including for a resident.

59:28.200 --> 59:29.200
 Yeah.

59:29.200 --> 59:33.200
 I know that Trent had trepidations in the beginning.

59:33.200 --> 59:43.200
 But if you listen to the words, if you forget the music, and if you forget what Nine Inch Nails sounds like, and you just read it like a poem,

59:43.200 --> 59:51.200
 and then you imagine a 70 year old man reading these lyrics, it'll be profound.

59:51.200 --> 59:52.200
 It's profound.

59:52.200 --> 59:57.200
 So that was the based on the lyrics that started the journey.

59:57.200 --> 1:00:01.200
 And then at this point in time, Johnny was not in great health.

1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:07.200
 And sometimes I would go to Nashville and record with him at his house.

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:13.200
 Sometimes he would come to California, but he was coming to California less regularly.

1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:22.200
 And because there were so many songs we wanted to try, he would start sometimes recording just a straight acoustic version.

1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:24.200
 Like he would have someone play guitar.

1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:31.200
 He would sing and they would send those to me and we would discuss like, is this one to build on?

1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:35.200
 And that was one where he said, I don't want to record this one until we're together.

1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:37.200
 I feel like we should do this one together.

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:45.200
 So on the next trip to California, we recorded it at my old house.

1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:55.200
 And I mean, all the songs we recorded felt special, so I can't say this one felt special.

1:00:55.200 --> 1:01:07.200
 But lyrically, it's more the lyrics have such a profound sense of regret.

1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:09.200
 What have I become?

1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:15.200
 And to hear when you're 20 years old talking about regret, it's heartbreaking,

1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:19.200
 but it's heartbreaking in a different way because you have a whole life to figure it out.

1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:25.200
 When you're looking back over your life at the end of your life with regret, it's brutal.

1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:26.200
 It's brutal.

1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:30.200
 So that was the initial spark of doing it.

1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:37.200
 And then when we recorded it, I believe it was two guitar players.

1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:48.200
 If I remember correctly, maybe even three, Smokey Hormel, Matt Sweeney and Mike Campbell, I believe.

1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:54.200
 And Ben Montenge was playing the piano in my living room as we were doing it.

1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:59.200
 And we cut the basic track with Johnny singing.

1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:03.200
 And then Johnny probably sang over that basic track a few more times.

1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:11.200
 And then we come to his vocal and then built up the drama.

1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:14.200
 And you didn't get to the part, but at the end of the song, it gets very loud.

1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:15.200
 The music gets very loud.

1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:19.200
 It's subtle because it's not anything that takes your ear.

1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:23.200
 And the vocal is so powerful that you don't really think about what's going on.

1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:24.200
 But it's building the whole time.

1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:25.200
 It's building.

1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:27.200
 And it even gets distorted at the end.

1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:34.200
 It gets really overpowering.

1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:37.200
 And that's part of the emotion of it.

1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:48.200
 I hear almost the anger and frustration.

1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:15.200
 And it just rings out the clean vocal.

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:18.200
 I mean, it's so simple, so incredible.

1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:27.200
 And it's interesting to have a young man's lyrics in an old Johnny Cash voice and heart and mind.

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:30.200
 Are you a fan of Tom Waits?

1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:31.200
 Of course.

1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:38.200
 Tom Waits is a song called Martha, but there's a bunch of songs he's written when he was young.

1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:44.200
 It's like, how does a young man have that melancholy wisdom?

1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:53.200
 The song Martha is about an older man calling a woman he used to love that she's not married

1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:56.200
 and he's married and they're having that conversation.

1:03:56.200 --> 1:04:01.200
 They haven't spoken for 30 years and they realize that they're still loved there.

1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:05.200
 And it could have been a different life, a different world where they could have been together.

1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:12.200
 And here's like a 23 year old Tom Waits writing so beautifully about something that's very...

1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:21.200
 I've had a lot of people tell me how real that as an older person looking back at that love that you had

1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:27.200
 and realizing it wasn't... it was really... it's still there, in clings of that love is still there.

1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:31.200
 I think there's a...

1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:39.200
 When a young person writes a sad song,

1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:47.200
 they almost seem more willing to go to a more hopeless place because they have a lover turning ahead.

1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:51.200
 And older artists tend to want to look at the bright side of things,

1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:57.200
 which also I think comes from the wisdom of aging. It's a more realistic position.

1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:01.200
 So it's not uncommon for younger people to write.

1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:08.200
 I think even in the Beatles, you'll see like their very heavy lyrics,

1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:15.200
 middle to late era Beatles, which is still... they're in their early 20s, I guess.

1:05:15.200 --> 1:05:18.200
 It's hard to think about so much accomplished.

1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:20.200
 Unbelievable.

1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:28.200
 And they went through the full journey from fun to darkness in a span of a few years.

1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:35.200
 You mentioned lyrics. So you've obviously produced albums with incredible lyrics.

1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:39.200
 I think you've mentioned the interesting characteristics of hip hop, of rap,

1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:47.200
 is that you're writing poetry to rhythm versus writing poetry to melody.

1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:50.200
 So that's like one way to think about it.

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:56.200
 And I'm a fan... I mean, Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, I'm a fan of poetry, period.

1:05:56.200 --> 1:06:05.200
 Is there something about highlighting the poetry of it, the power of words you did with hurt?

1:06:05.200 --> 1:06:15.200
 It's a Tom Waits song that's less than a minute long that I always go back to.

1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:19.200
 It's one I really love and has just a few lines.

1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:22.200
 It's called I Want You.

1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:37.200
 And all it is is him saying I want you.

1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:53.200
 This is a 22 year old Tom Waits.

1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:27.200
 And then he hums for 20 more seconds.

1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:29.200
 Beautiful.

1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:38.200
 For people who don't know Tom Waits, you should definitely listen to him and his voice sounds very different now.

1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:45.200
 And it's interesting to see the evolution of a human voice, the artist over time.

1:07:45.200 --> 1:07:52.200
 Because that's a boylike voice, hopeful, less clever, less witty, more simple.

1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:54.200
 That simplicity is there.

1:07:54.200 --> 1:08:02.200
 I mean, that takes guts to be so simple, I would say, lyrically and musically.

1:08:02.200 --> 1:08:07.200
 Is there laying that out on the table?

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:17.200
 Is there ways that you like to highlight the voice, the lyrics, or is there no one rule?

1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:27.200
 What is the thing that makes music special? Is it the rhythm, the melody, or is ultimately the lyrics are always there?

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:28.200
 Or the idea?

1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:30.200
 You just asked me five different questions.

1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:32.200
 I don't care, I'll just get that.

1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:35.200
 It's not about you.

1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:37.200
 You don't want the answers.

1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:39.200
 I don't want the answers.

1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:43.200
 I'll listen.

1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:48.200
 I look forward to your comments, the internet.

1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:52.200
 You have the greatest producer of all time in front of you and you can't shut the hell up.

1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:55.200
 That's right, friends.

1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:57.200
 But you do value lyrics.

1:08:57.200 --> 1:08:59.200
 Is there a way to celebrate lyrics?

1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:01.200
 I value lyrics if the lyrics are important.

1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:03.200
 I'm not a lyric person.

1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:12.200
 I'm very much whatever the thing that makes the thing good is the thing that I'm drawn to, for me.

1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:15.200
 For a long time, lyrics meant very little.

1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:18.200
 I would say from the beginning.

1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:20.200
 From the earliest days.

1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:22.200
 Fight for your right to party, Beastie Boys?

1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:24.200
 Yeah, it was fun.

1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:28.200
 I thought they were good lyrics, but it wasn't what was important.

1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:33.200
 I mean, it was in a almost a novelty way, not in a serious way.

1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:41.200
 Early in my career, I was much more focused on the rhythm, first the rhythm.

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:48.200
 And if the lyrics weren't good enough, I would be aware of it, but it wasn't the driving force for me.

1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:54.200
 And eventually over time, then melody became an important piece, which it wasn't in the beginning.

1:09:54.200 --> 1:10:05.200
 And then lyrics became more important over time, but it's always been always changing what draws me in.

1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:16.200
 And one of the things I found as it relates to lyrics that can give a lyric a different power has to do with rhythm,

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:24.200
 where if there's no drum, the lyrics tend to mean more.

1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:32.200
 So earlier, what you were saying about if it was just acapella, you felt Marvin Gaye in a different way hearing the acapella.

1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:48.200
 Can you comment on, I mean, in terms of one of the greatest albums ever?

1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:51.200
 Why does it sound so raw?

1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:52.200
 Her voice.

1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:54.200
 She's just a great singer.

1:10:54.200 --> 1:11:05.200
 But you're not doing anything else, you're doing the strumming, and then there's just a single beat.

1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:25.200
 And then it builds.

1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:43.200
 This gets simpler, but it feels like it's a giant orchestra.

1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:50.200
 There's backing vocals.

1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:53.200
 The anger.

1:11:53.200 --> 1:12:00.200
 I love it.

1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:08.200
 There's something about such a powerful voice and the instruments not getting in the way.

1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:12.200
 I mean, the same with her and Johnny Cash.

1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:18.200
 Why does it sound so raw?

1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:20.200
 It's the same as her.

1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:23.200
 It feels like you're in the room with them.

1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:26.200
 It feels like they're not even singing.

1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:30.200
 They're literally freshly mad and angry.

1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:34.200
 I think those are the things that make great singers sound like great singers.

1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:38.200
 It's not anything that's happening in the studio.

1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:47.200
 I would say the only thing that us in the studio can do is kind of get out of the way and not ruin it.

1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:53.200
 That's what comes through of these people.

1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:59.200
 I should also, before I forget, there is a lot of song choices on that CD.

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:03.200
 I would love to see the full options on the CD that you sent to Johnny Cash that I love.

1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:08.200
 So Solitaire Man was one of my favorite choices made there.

1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:11.200
 Is that a Neil Diamond song?

1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:19.200
 It's funny to talk about them as songs because I tend to listen more to albums than songs.

1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:23.200
 That's what you're doing in your head. You're pulling up the album, essentially.

1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:28.200
 I'm going to that song, but I don't know. I've never listened to that song.

1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:34.200
 But I know that when that song comes up in the sequence of the album, it has a really powerful effect in me.

1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:56.200
 Let's see what it does if you just start it.

1:13:56.200 --> 1:14:06.200
 It's so interesting. Wow.

1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:42.200
 That's beautiful. Such a beautiful choice.

1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:46.200
 Beautiful melody. Such a beautiful melody in haunting words.

1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:56.200
 The song is so simple. I was born in the Soviet Union.

1:14:56.200 --> 1:15:09.200
 When you're growing up, there are a few bands that are probably forbidden, but they seep in.

1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:19.200
 You get bootlegged and they somehow take over the culture of the young folks, such as myself.

1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:26.200
 On the metal side, it was Metallica and Iron Maiden.

1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:29.200
 I don't know what you call them, but Beastie Boys.

1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:39.200
 I remember hearing a fight for your right, and it was just like, for some reason that stuck as it did for a lot of people in Russia.

1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:46.200
 I was like, wow, America is when you get the safe fuck you to the man, the rebellion, the freedom.

1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:53.200
 I probably heard it a few years after it was released because it kind of, it dissipates to the culture.

1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:56.200
 You get the bootlegged. It means hard to get your hands on.

1:15:56.200 --> 1:16:03.200
 I just remember, I mean, I wanted to kind of bring that up because it was such a personally important song to me.

1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:06.200
 And yet, probably you didn't even think of that.

1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:12.200
 You probably thought of it as its role in the culture here in the United States, like in terms of musically.

1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:16.200
 I was, you know, 20, 21 years old.

1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:18.200
 Well, you were that kid too, right?

1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:23.200
 We were just making fun songs for our friends. There was no expectation.

1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:24.200
 That's just a fun song.

1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:28.200
 Yeah, no one thought we would never imagine anybody would like any of it.

1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:30.200
 One of the greatest albums ever.

1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:32.200
 Yeah!

1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:42.200
 I have to, it's, I love this so much. I just remember, this is America.

1:16:42.200 --> 1:16:51.200
 I didn't even know, I didn't even understand the lyrics to be honest.

1:16:51.200 --> 1:17:07.200
 And the lyrics are ridiculous, ridiculous.

1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:32.200
 So hearing that and hearing Metallica, Master Puppets, I was like,

1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:37.200
 I knew I'm gonna have to end up in America one day.

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:42.200
 I mean, maybe now that I'm more mature or maybe a little bit more mature,

1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:46.200
 I realized like that was kind of the longing for freedom.

1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:51.200
 It felt like, at least at the time, if this is allowed, then anything is allowed.

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:52.200
 Yeah.

1:17:52.200 --> 1:18:02.200
 And I think that the rebellion of it, the, I guess it's also fun.

1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:03.200
 I just loved it.

1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:10.200
 Is there, if you look back to that, because you're a, I mean, you're that person,

1:18:10.200 --> 1:18:12.200
 not just the producer, it feels like.

1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:16.200
 Yes and no, like it was, even to us then, it was still like satirical.

1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:17.200
 It was.

1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:18.200
 Oh, absolutely.

1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:22.200
 But isn't like music in part, like you're dancing in the line,

1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:28.200
 it's part satirical, part serious in the sense, like you're losing yourself in the satire?

1:18:28.200 --> 1:18:37.200
 Like anytime you go over the top, isn't that part of the, or is it explicitly satirical?

1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:41.200
 You're making fun, I mean, girls, there's a lot of ridiculous songs in that album.

1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:42.200
 I don't know.

1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:45.200
 I just think it's, it was definitely to make each other laugh.

1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:47.200
 Like we were trying to make each other laugh.

1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:49.200
 We weren't trying to make a point.

1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:51.200
 We were trying to make each other laugh.

1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:58.200
 But that person, how's that person different than the person today in you?

1:18:58.200 --> 1:19:00.200
 The person that produced that record?

1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:01.200
 I wouldn't say so different.

1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:07.200
 Like it really is that, that I like things that make me laugh, you know, I like ridiculous

1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:08.200
 things.

1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:09.200
 The same person still.

1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:10.200
 I think so.

1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:13.200
 It is a strange, just how many incredible.

1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:17.200
 I mean, I wouldn't, I don't think I would make that today, but I understand why we made

1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:18.200
 it when we did.

1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:26.200
 It's in the vocabulary of ridiculous that would make sense to do.

1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:31.200
 You know, for the right artist today, could make something ridiculous and gives you that

1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:32.200
 feeling.

1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:40.120
 I mean, there's just a sense when you make so many different albums, then you look back

1:19:40.120 --> 1:19:45.120
 at that creation and it can feel like a different person created that.

1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:50.720
 But you're making it seem like if you travel back in time, I maybe do a memory replay.

1:19:50.720 --> 1:19:56.120
 You'd be able to hang out with the, with the teenage in the 20s, recruitment.

1:19:56.120 --> 1:20:01.120
 Yeah, I don't think, I don't think I was so different honestly.

1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:02.120
 That's hilarious.

1:20:02.120 --> 1:20:03.120
 It's funny.

1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:12.120
 I ran into someone recently in Costa Rica who I hadn't seen in a long time and who I knew

1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:19.120
 from the New York days when those days and, and we spent a couple of hours talking and

1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:23.760
 she said, you're exactly the same person that you were then.

1:20:23.760 --> 1:20:30.120
 So I have a short, you know, a recent confirmation that that's the case.

1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:31.120
 That's beautiful.

1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:35.240
 And was it, Tim Ferriss asked you about like, who's the most successful person, you know,

1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:39.760
 that's the definition of success, I would say, you're the exactly the same person.

1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:43.800
 You haven't lost yourself or rather you found yourself early on.

1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:51.320
 I would say there are aspects of me that have changed for sure, but I, but I can't say that

1:20:51.320 --> 1:20:57.400
 it's, that it's necessarily better, it's different.

1:20:57.400 --> 1:21:05.680
 I would say at that time I was more confident than I am now and I'm very confident now.

1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:14.920
 But then I had an unrealistic confidence and I think now it's a little more based in reality.

1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:17.360
 At that point in time, I'd never been depressed.

1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:23.560
 And then once you go through a depression, well, some people I know in my case, when

1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:28.960
 I went through a depression afterwards, I was a different person than I was before.

1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:35.320
 And I feel more grounded now than I did then.

1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:41.480
 And I probably relate to the artists who, so many of the artists I work with suffer,

1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:45.880
 so many artists suffer because that's part of what makes an artist great is their level

1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:53.640
 of sensitivity, that the same thing that makes an artist uncomfortable, other people don't

1:21:53.640 --> 1:21:56.400
 feel at all.

1:21:56.400 --> 1:22:03.560
 The time you were depressed, what was the darkest moments of your life?

1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:04.560
 What took you there?

1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:05.560
 How did you get out?

1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:13.560
 It was triggered by a person making a comment about something to do with work that didn't

1:22:13.560 --> 1:22:14.560
 matter.

1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:19.320
 And to anyone else, they would hear that and they would just be like, okay, we'll deal

1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:20.640
 with it next week, whatever.

1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:27.280
 But for some reason, I took it in a way that I felt like the rug had been pulled out from

1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:34.560
 under me, even beyond the rational part of it, of understanding, even after the problem

1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:41.800
 that came up was solved, it somehow undermined something in me and made me feel very vulnerable

1:22:41.800 --> 1:22:43.800
 in a way that I hadn't felt before.

1:22:43.800 --> 1:22:48.640
 And it spiraled, how did you get out?

1:22:48.640 --> 1:22:50.920
 I did a lot of different kinds of therapy.

1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:54.520
 I did starting with alternative therapies.

1:22:54.520 --> 1:23:10.200
 I was seeing, I would say between seven and eight doctors and or therapists a week, acupuncture,

1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:24.360
 drug therapy, herbs, any possible modality, tried everything for a long time, and nothing

1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:26.760
 seemed to have an impact.

1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:38.480
 And then finally, I'm wary of taking any Western medicine, I'm not a drug taker, and

1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:43.160
 or drinker, partier in any way.

1:23:43.160 --> 1:23:51.760
 And I found a psychopharmacologist who was a psychic, but because she was a psychic,

1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:56.680
 I was okay to see her because she's like, I'll do, I'll listen to a psychic, but I'm

1:23:56.680 --> 1:23:59.720
 not going to listen to a psychopharmacologist.

1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:06.960
 But the fact that she had the psychic that made her fit into my worldview.

1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:12.840
 And she recommended antidepressant, which went terribly wrong in the first night that

1:24:12.840 --> 1:24:14.080
 I took it.

1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:18.240
 And then that set me on a journey of looking for the right antidepressant, which was a

1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:24.440
 long and painful process, every one that I took made me sick, everyone.

1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:29.720
 And then finally, so I don't know, five months later, six months later, I found the magic

1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:31.920
 one that worked for me.

1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:37.040
 And it shifted me out of the depression.

1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:43.280
 I took it for, my camera was six months or a year, and then weaned off and was okay.

1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:47.000
 And then I had another event some years later.

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:52.000
 I think I took it again for a short period of time and got out of it, and I've not needed

1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:53.000
 it since.

1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:58.640
 Were you able to kind of introspect the triggers that led to the events?

1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:02.600
 Is there something, or is it random events of life?

1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:10.760
 I think it's more that because of the way that I grew up, I never had to deal with much

1:25:10.760 --> 1:25:14.040
 controversy.

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:21.600
 And when I was challenged, I didn't have any ability to deal with it.

1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:26.320
 It's like, you know, Jonathan Haidt talks about, it's like that.

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:30.800
 So you've actually also mentioned like business sometimes gives you stress.

1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:33.200
 So this was business related stuff.

1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:34.200
 Yeah.

1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:35.360
 It was a business related thing.

1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:37.160
 It just made me feel bad.

1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:43.480
 It's one of the saddest things about art and music is that it's often interleaved with

1:25:43.480 --> 1:25:45.840
 business folk.

1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:53.840
 As opposed to the way of the world, if you have a capitalist system, but it makes that

1:25:53.840 --> 1:26:04.800
 business folks rubbing up against artists can sometimes destroy a fragile mind and soul.

1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:08.200
 To me, like one of the best representations of an artist, honestly, is Johnny I have the

1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:13.600
 designer from Apple, and he's just so fragile with his ideas, and he talked about like when

1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:18.280
 he has ideas, he really wouldn't show it to Steve Jobs or anybody except for a small

1:26:18.280 --> 1:26:21.880
 design team, because he was so nervous that it would break.

1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:26.040
 Let it give it a chance, let it give it a chance to grow.

1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:34.040
 And it seems like the outside world, business people, PR people, people kind of have not

1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:40.000
 lost themselves in the passion of creating, but instead are kind of representing or like

1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.400
 making deals, all that kind of stuff.

1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:49.000
 They can kind of trample on those little ideas, and it's sad to see.

1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:53.240
 It's really heartbreaking to see because you know how much trampling there's going on.

1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:54.680
 It's one of the main jobs.

1:26:54.680 --> 1:27:04.120
 My job as a record producer is to keep the voices away from the artist, from all of the

1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:11.240
 people who are really on their side, but don't know, whether it be people, anyone on the

1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:17.480
 business side who doesn't make things, they're excited to do their part.

1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:19.480
 They're excited.

1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:25.400
 When you deliver the art that you make to me, then we can start the project.

1:27:25.400 --> 1:27:30.800
 But there's nothing to sell if the art doesn't happen in the right way, and it has to be

1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:39.080
 protected, and it can't happen on the same kind of a timetable that business can.

1:27:39.080 --> 1:27:40.880
 It's just a different thing.

1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:44.000
 Art doesn't come in a quarterly way.

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:48.560
 And that doesn't apply just to music or it applies to art, it applies to all creative

1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:49.560
 pursuits.

1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:57.280
 This is generally the case at MIT, it's just there's the administration, and then there

1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:03.280
 is the professors and students, and the professors and students are the creative folk.

1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:08.800
 They create stuff, they dream, they have wild ideas that go on tangents and so on.

1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:14.400
 They have hopes and they go with those and they get on these weird, passionate pursuits,

1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:18.800
 and then the administration can often just trample on that.

1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:28.320
 And they set up bars in all kinds of ways that you think you're not actually hurting,

1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:30.280
 but you really are.

1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:36.560
 And I won't mention why, because this happens to everybody, and I have a large amount of

1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:45.440
 leverage at MIT now, but even I get a little bit of pressure in such stupid ways to be

1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:46.440
 careful.

1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:49.960
 Be careful, Lex, we really want your career to succeed.

1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:50.960
 Be careful.

1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:57.480
 And that little pressure to an artist, do you want to go acapella, do you want to do

1:28:57.480 --> 1:28:59.200
 a country record?

1:28:59.200 --> 1:29:00.200
 Be careful.

1:29:00.200 --> 1:29:01.680
 You're already a superstar.

1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:02.680
 Be careful.

1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:08.920
 And then in that way, you kind of push people like flock of fish into one fish tank where

1:29:08.920 --> 1:29:10.960
 they're all the same.

1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:15.720
 And it's sad to see, and it's obviously in the modern world, there's nice mechanism

1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:20.480
 to protect, to let artists flourish a little bit more, because they get to put themselves

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:23.360
 to the world and get a little bit more confidence.

1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:26.760
 Maybe different funding mechanisms, all that kind of stuff.

1:29:26.760 --> 1:29:32.440
 Tremendous problem that the voices that don't understand interfere with the process is huge.

1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:39.000
 The other side of it is, in success, there can be a lack of reality where all of the

1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:43.080
 people around the successful person just tell them everything they do is great.

1:29:43.080 --> 1:29:51.200
 And then they don't have anything to bump up against anymore or have a realistic sense

1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:59.440
 of how things work or how things measure.

1:29:59.440 --> 1:30:08.280
 So both sides are really important, both avoiding the voices getting in the way and having a

1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:16.120
 trusted group of Asanga, a group of people who can say, I don't know if that's as good.

1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:20.360
 And you can still say, I don't care what you think, that's fine.

1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:21.920
 But it helps to hear it.

1:30:21.920 --> 1:30:31.200
 What helps to have, if someone who you respect tells you something isn't good enough, it's

1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:32.200
 helpful.

1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:35.920
 When you know it comes from a place of love, when it comes from a place of wisdom.

1:30:35.920 --> 1:30:40.640
 And not from a place of fear, not from a place of, oh, this doesn't sound like it's

1:30:40.640 --> 1:30:43.560
 going to do as well as your last thing.

1:30:43.560 --> 1:30:45.680
 That's not the point.

1:30:45.680 --> 1:30:55.240
 The point is on this quest for greatness, are you living up to your ability?

1:30:55.240 --> 1:30:57.960
 By the way, is there something interesting to say about your worldview?

1:30:57.960 --> 1:31:04.960
 Because you mentioned psychic and sort of the ways we can be healthy.

1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:14.760
 The ways we can grow and how much maybe medicine or science has the answers.

1:31:14.760 --> 1:31:18.080
 Is there some interesting way to describe that worldview?

1:31:18.080 --> 1:31:19.920
 I would just say I'm open mind.

1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:22.960
 I believe anything's possible.

1:31:22.960 --> 1:31:28.120
 And if I was going to trust in any practical information, it would be something thousands

1:31:28.120 --> 1:31:30.600
 of years old.

1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:32.480
 There's wisdom in that history.

1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:33.480
 Yeah.

1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:35.400
 Well, it's more tested.

1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:42.320
 It's not always right, but at least it's been somewhat tested.

1:31:42.320 --> 1:31:45.040
 So science is also tested.

1:31:45.040 --> 1:31:48.920
 The thing I'm a little bit skeptical of sometimes is just the hubris that often comes with the

1:31:48.920 --> 1:31:54.960
 modern, with the latest, the newest, this feeling like you've figured it all out.

1:31:54.960 --> 1:31:58.120
 Everything that's been done in the past has no wisdom.

1:31:58.120 --> 1:32:01.600
 And we basically solved every problem.

1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:02.760
 There's nothing else to be solved.

1:32:02.760 --> 1:32:07.280
 I mean, that's a defining characteristic of any age is like, we've solved all the problems

1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:08.280
 there are.

1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:13.040
 The final answers and our parents are all stupid.

1:32:13.040 --> 1:32:14.040
 That kind of energy.

1:32:14.040 --> 1:32:15.040
 Yeah.

1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:18.240
 You have to be extremely, extremely careful with that when it talks about, when you think

1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:22.880
 about something as complex as the human body or the human mind, you have to be very, very,

1:32:22.880 --> 1:32:23.880
 very careful.

1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:26.000
 I believe we know close to nothing.

1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:27.000
 Yeah.

1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:28.000
 Exactly.

1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:29.000
 Close to nothing.

1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:30.000
 That's about anything.

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:31.000
 About anything.

1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:32.000
 About anything.

1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:36.200
 That place of humility is a good place to start to figure, to figure it all out.

1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:38.560
 In the end, we'll still know almost nothing.

1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:39.560
 Yeah.

1:32:39.560 --> 1:32:40.560
 I don't think we need to know.

1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:42.560
 It's like we need to see what works.

1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:44.760
 So we need to see what works for us.

1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:46.480
 It's interesting to know.

1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:52.920
 I know on the art side, knowing how it works isn't what makes it work.

1:32:52.920 --> 1:32:55.880
 You know, isn't the magic of it, isn't how it works.

1:32:55.880 --> 1:32:58.120
 The magic is the magic.

1:32:58.120 --> 1:33:06.160
 And the magic happens in a way that's intuitive and accidental at times or incidental at times.

1:33:06.160 --> 1:33:10.840
 Incidental where you're trying many things and all of a sudden something works and you

1:33:10.840 --> 1:33:12.720
 don't know why.

1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:14.880
 And it's okay not to know why.

1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:19.680
 It doesn't really matter why, as long as it does the thing that you want it to do, whatever

1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:20.680
 that is.

1:33:20.680 --> 1:33:21.680
 Yeah.

1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:22.680
 That's so weird.

1:33:22.680 --> 1:33:26.680
 When you know the components, you know, you still, yeah, the magic.

1:33:26.680 --> 1:33:27.680
 What's the magic?

1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:28.680
 Where is the magic?

1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:31.680
 Like we know the components for stuff I care about, artificial intelligence.

1:33:31.680 --> 1:33:39.840
 We know that components of a powerful computing machinery, where does consciousness come from?

1:33:39.840 --> 1:33:41.640
 What is that?

1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:47.400
 What is the brilliant moments of insight come from?

1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:48.400
 What's that?

1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:55.040
 When even in simple games of chess or in simple, where do those breakthrough ideas of taking

1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:58.280
 the big risk that doesn't make any sense and then all of a sudden it becomes something

1:33:58.280 --> 1:33:59.280
 beautiful.

1:33:59.280 --> 1:34:00.280
 Yeah.

1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:01.760
 Yeah, it just happens.

1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:02.760
 It just happens.

1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:07.680
 And often the things that end up breaking through, don't break through in the way we

1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:12.840
 thought or turn out to be a third iteration of something that we thought was an entirely

1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:16.520
 different thing or we don't know.

1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:23.200
 And I think it's, if we embrace that not knowing, we'll have a healthier experience

1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:24.560
 going through life.

1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:25.560
 You made a lot.

1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:27.240
 It's not just music.

1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:28.240
 Everything.

1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:30.640
 It shares the furniture as well.

1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:35.440
 You've done, like I said, the documentary, I guess you would say, with Paul McCartney.

1:34:35.440 --> 1:34:43.440
 And you've done a podcast yourself, a broken record podcast, and you've done conversation

1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:44.760
 too.

1:34:44.760 --> 1:34:48.760
 So what have you learned from that process about the art of conversation?

1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:57.960
 And also maybe what advice would you give to this, to me, about what to do with conversation?

1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:00.720
 Like what is interesting to you about conversation?

1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:10.320
 One of the things that I like is to not feel like there is any stakes or that it's actually

1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:12.080
 almost that it's not happening.

1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:19.080
 Like the fact that when I came in, you were setting up cameras, made it less good for me.

1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:22.160
 I knew that that would impact the conversation in a negative way.

1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:29.600
 The best version of it would be if we didn't see the cameras, and we didn't see any technology,

1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:33.360
 and we were just sitting at this table having a conversation, maybe even if we were mic'd

1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:37.640
 beforehand, it would be okay if it was necessary.

1:35:37.640 --> 1:35:41.280
 But then we were just sitting here having a conversation, no people in the room, nothing,

1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:43.560
 and feeling like we're just having a conversation.

1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:53.840
 I feel like it would get closer to the relaxed feeling.

1:35:53.840 --> 1:35:58.320
 Same thing we do in the studios, like you've heard of Red Light Fever, when artists get

1:35:58.320 --> 1:36:02.080
 nervous when they play a song, great, and then the tape starts rolling and they can't

1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:03.240
 play it.

1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:06.320
 And we're all to some degree like that.

1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:12.800
 When you were with Paul McCartney, were you cognizant of cameras?

1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:18.360
 We had the room black, everybody who was working there was dressed in black.

1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:19.720
 Everything was invisible.

1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:27.680
 We were lit in a way where even though there were probably between 12 and 20 people working

1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:34.320
 in the room, within three minutes of starting the conversation, Paul and I were alone in

1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:35.320
 the room.

1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:36.560
 So that was the feeling.

1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:39.680
 On occasion, you'd hear a noise, and it would be weird.

1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:46.440
 We also had nobody was allowed to wear shoes because we were trying to create this intimate

1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:47.440
 space.

1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:56.040
 And I know in the recording studio, when we're recording, if even one person is there that's

1:36:56.040 --> 1:37:01.520
 just watching and not working, like there's usually, I'm usually there and an engineer

1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:04.480
 is there technically making it happen.

1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:09.440
 If anyone else is in the room, it's different because then it goes from this moment where

1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:19.080
 the person's doing a performance to the sense or where the person is feeling something internally

1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:25.040
 and we're capturing it to the other version is they're performing for someone.

1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:26.200
 It's so interesting.

1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:29.000
 So like to push back the alternatives here.

1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:35.520
 So one, about the third person, not to make people self conscious, but I find that I'm

1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:42.000
 so torn on that because sometimes when that person, like Evan is in the room here, he's

1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:43.000
 been in the room before.

1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.600
 He's a huge fan of yours, by the way.

1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:53.880
 So he'll nod, yeah, he'll get excited, he's like, and you can see that nodding.

1:37:53.880 --> 1:38:00.000
 And for some reason for me, he's like, yeah, you get it, like, yeah, you get excited together.

1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:03.840
 I mean, that third person can be like a really special.

1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:10.840
 So having an audience when it's a friend or somebody that has that love in them, it depends

1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:11.840
 on the performer.

1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:12.840
 Yeah.

1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:13.840
 Yeah.

1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:19.760
 Some people really thrive in front of an audience and you're saying you like that simple intimacy

1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:24.280
 of well, I like the reality of it now being, I want it to be as far from a performance as

1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:25.280
 possible.

1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:26.280
 Got it.

1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:31.960
 And if, if someone, I'll tell you a story, a story that just happened and it was viewed

1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:37.240
 as kind of a, it seemed uncool in the moment to the person that it happened to.

1:38:37.240 --> 1:38:39.240
 It wasn't at all.

1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:44.640
 We were recording the New Chili Peppers album, which is coming out, I think, any day now,

1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:48.720
 like, I don't know what today's date is, but within the next, it, maybe by the time this

1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:50.920
 airs, it will be out.

1:38:50.920 --> 1:38:57.800
 And the band was playing in the studio and it was ripping because they play, they're

1:38:57.800 --> 1:38:58.800
 incredible.

1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:08.160
 And one of the members walked through the control room after a particularly great performance

1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:14.080
 and the engineer said, wow, that solo was really great.

1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:19.800
 And the person who heard this said, please don't say that and walked away.

1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:27.240
 It's like, it, it was not, it just changed this feeling of we're in this place where

1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:30.640
 we're doing this thing and there's, there is no outside world.

1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:31.640
 Yeah.

1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:33.160
 You know, we're, we're doing this for us.

1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:35.840
 We're going as deep as we can for us.

1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:42.480
 And as soon as there's an acknowledgement to someone else in a way, it breaks the concentration

1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:45.720
 of being inside of it.

1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:51.520
 That's so well told and, but it's something about saying, wow, that's always great is,

1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:56.000
 is, uh, shows the, it reminds you that there's an outside world, but I feel like there's

1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:00.720
 a way to enter the inside world as an audience.

1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:03.040
 So you just have to do that.

1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:08.800
 So it's, it matters what you say, it matters how you look.

1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:09.800
 It matters.

1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:15.880
 Uh, so there's like these generic compliments, not generic, but they, they sound in the way

1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:21.000
 an outside world would interact as opposed to in that creative thing where you're dancing

1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:22.520
 around the fire together or something.

1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:26.080
 There was actually, I can tell you there's another interesting one that happened to me,

1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:30.320
 and I didn't know this until I saw the film of it, which was a strange one.

1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:38.680
 Um, we were recording with the avid brothers and, um, the song was called no hard feelings

1:40:38.680 --> 1:41:02.680
 and it was this recording of no hard feelings.

1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:28.680
 It's such a great voice, so beautiful.

1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:36.200
 It is.

1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:41.200
 The rings on my fingers and the keys to my house

1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:48.200
 With no hard feelings

1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:56.200
 When the sun hangs low in the west

1:41:56.200 --> 1:42:02.200
 And the light in my chest won't be kept

1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:07.200
 Held a day any longer

1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:11.200
 When the jealousy fades away

1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:14.200
 So bright, so hopeful, so lighthearted

1:42:14.200 --> 1:42:17.200
 For cash and lust

1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:21.200
 And it's just hallelujah

1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:24.200
 And love and balm

1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:27.200
 Love and the words

1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:31.200
 Love and the songs they sing in the church

1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:40.200
 And no hard feelings

1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:46.200
 Lord knows they haven't done

1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:53.200
 Much good for anyone

1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:59.200
 Can't be afraid and cold

1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:04.200
 With so much to hide at home

1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:09.200
 Hmm

1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:17.200
 When my body won't hold me anymore

1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:22.200
 And if I leave, let's be free

1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:25.200
 Where will I go?

1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:28.200
 Does he sound as good as good, yeah?

1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:30.200
 Yes, every bit.

1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:35.200
 Take this out through Georgia rain

1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:38.200
 A tropical rain

1:43:38.200 --> 1:43:42.200
 A snow from the heavens

1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:50.200
 Will I join with the ocean blue

1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:56.200
 Or run into the savior truth

1:43:56.200 --> 1:44:00.200
 And shake hands laughing

1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:03.200
 And walk through the night

1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:05.200
 Straight to the light

1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:10.200
 Holding the love I've known in my life

1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:19.200
 And no hard feelings

1:44:19.200 --> 1:44:25.200
 Lord knows they haven't done

1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:32.200
 Much good for anyone

1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:38.200
 Can't be afraid and cold

1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:44.200
 With so much to hide at home

1:44:44.200 --> 1:44:50.200
 Under the pretty sky

1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:56.200
 I'm totally learning why

1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:03.200
 It matters for me and you

1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:09.200
 To say it and me and you

1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:14.200
 The life in the toilet

1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:16.200
 This is building and building and building

1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:22.200
 All the time we've had

1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:28.200
 Because it's been to me

1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:35.200
 I have no enemies

1:45:35.200 --> 1:45:41.200
 I have no enemies

1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:47.200
 I have no enemies

1:45:47.200 --> 1:46:13.200
 I have no enemies

1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:17.200
 That's the incredible song.

1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:20.200
 This was 4, 5 years ago or something like that.

1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:23.200
 But what happened with this, that happened.

1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:26.200
 I mean, they're great and it's always good.

1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:31.200
 But that performance in that moment felt like the sky opened.

1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:33.200
 It's unbelievable.

1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:35.200
 This was a single take.

1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:39.200
 Yeah, that was incredible.

1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:49.280
 Yeah. When it, when it ended, I said, great, what do you want to do next? And they, they said,

1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:53.440
 we just need a few minutes. They walked out and that's all I know. It's like, okay,

1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:58.960
 laying down, wait until they're ready to start again. And then the film, there was a film made

1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:03.760
 of the sessions of this, they went out and they're like, what was that? Like, like,

1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:11.840
 like, like, didn't he get what just happened? Like, like, uh, because it was so heavy. Yeah.

1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:20.800
 And it was just as heavy for me. And in the spirit of we're here to make the most great

1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:26.960
 stuff we can, we're not going to like open champagne. Like that's not, it's like, great.

1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:35.040
 What do you want to do next? It's like, let's, let's not revel in this. Yeah. Let's, but

1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:40.960
 they took it as like, this guy just like, doesn't even understand what we're doing.

1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:47.120
 That's funny until I saw the film. That's funny. Whoa, that was the reaction. Yeah.

1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:52.000
 But I think your response is the right risk to take, right? Cause it's, it's the celebration

1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:58.640
 at the end of a, you, you want to keep like, uh, people celebrate too early. Yes. Great.

1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:06.400
 And now let's use that momentum. We're in the zone. Yeah. What's next? Yeah. Yeah. But you,

1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:13.040
 yourself in conversation. So you said that you want to create this, would you use the word

1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:17.920
 intimacy? Like, is it to create or just the most real? Like there's no cameras, there's no mics.

1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:23.440
 I would say a place where you're comfortable to be naked, you know, a vulnerable, a place where

1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:30.560
 you can be your most vulnerable without questioning it. You want to, you want to really be able to

1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:36.240
 let your guard down and to, you know, if you want to start crying when you're singing, whatever it is,

1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:41.040
 whatever it is. And it's, it's hard to get to that place. And again, just the idea of someone,

1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:47.120
 you know, like, Hey, that was good. That could take you right out of that going in, you know,

1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:53.360
 going in. It's so interesting to think about how to achieve that and still have mics. Yeah.

1:48:54.080 --> 1:49:02.400
 That, uh, it's hard. It's harder. It's harder. Some of it is space. Some of it is raw conversational

1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:10.720
 skill. Like there's something about certain, well, some of that is also just like, you have that,

1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:15.680
 as I'm sure you were, there's a, there's a legend to recubin. And there's like my

1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:21.040
 now friend, Joe Rogan, there's a legend to him. And when you show up into Joe Rogan's studio,

1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:29.920
 the legend creates an aura. And he, I think subconsciously or consciously uses it to like,

1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:36.800
 this is somehow that it's nervous, nervous, nervous. And then you realize, oh, he's just,

1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:41.360
 he's just human or something. I don't, there's a relief. And then yeah, you could be,

1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:46.480
 you could be yourself at that. So that's that nervousness, nervousness, nervousness. And it's

1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:52.080
 like, oh, it's not that, uh, this legend is just a human and it's just, it's normal. So I don't

1:49:52.080 --> 1:50:00.000
 know how that's done. Um, but it's so interesting to think about how that's because I forget recording.

1:50:00.640 --> 1:50:05.840
 I just enjoy it when it's real. Like this microphone gives us an excuse to connect

1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:10.800
 on a human level and forget that nobody's listening. It doesn't matter. I would say I felt maybe in the

1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:15.440
 last 15 minutes, I was less aware of anybody else being in the room or any equipment here.

1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:17.280
 Yeah. But it took that long.

1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:24.080
 That's so interesting. I hadn't, didn't have that at all. All I had, I mean, the wind calmed down

1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:30.720
 outside, but there was a wind before. And there's something about the wind that you can think of

1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:35.840
 it from an audio engineering perspective. Like, oh, I wonder if the wind creates sound or whatever

1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:44.400
 that you hear. But I was thinking like, none of this matters. Like the wind is like nature will

1:50:44.400 --> 1:50:50.160
 be here before us, after us, and all of this will be dead and forgotten. That's what the wind was

1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:56.080
 reminding me of. It's almost like laughing at the fact that we could even consider itself

1:50:56.080 --> 1:51:06.240
 important enough to put on clothes and talk. But you love it. You love talking. You love the podcast

1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:09.360
 and just that. What did you dive into that? Like what?

1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:15.920
 It was not in, it was a strange occurrence. My friend Malcolm said he wanted to start doing a

1:51:15.920 --> 1:51:20.400
 podcast about music and asked if I would do it with him. It's like, I like Malcolm. And I

1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:25.040
 thought it would be more like his podcast, which is not an interview podcast. I thought it was

1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:35.920
 going to be telling stories in the music world using audio stories. And then it just started

1:51:35.920 --> 1:51:42.160
 being interviews. Not again, it wasn't intentional. Just started that way and ended up being that.

1:51:42.160 --> 1:51:48.000
 But I love it. And I love both because I get to talk to people that I don't know. But also when

1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:52.720
 I get to talk to people that I know and ask them about things that we would never talk about ever.

1:51:52.720 --> 1:51:56.240
 You know, I don't know the origin stories of any of the people, any of my friends.

1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:01.600
 So to get to hear their perspective, another like relating to the chili peppers,

1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:08.640
 because their album's coming out now, I interviewed all four members of the band individually.

1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:14.640
 John, I interviewed John and Midway through Anthony came in and then I interviewed Flea

1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:20.400
 separately and I interviewed Chad separately. And it was fascinating. I know them for 30 years.

1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:25.920
 And I learned a tremendous amount because you don't ask people about themselves when you're just

1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:33.360
 you know, workmates. They're friends. I do this sometimes. I'll just set up my microphones and

1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:38.720
 I'll record a thing for private consumption with friends or loved ones. It's fascinating.

1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:42.720
 It's a good idea. Because you get to ask those ridiculous questions. First of all,

1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:48.240
 about life, about the future, about the past, about little fears and the things you miss.

1:52:48.240 --> 1:52:54.880
 And yeah, there's something that people just reveal, first loves, all those kinds of things.

1:52:55.600 --> 1:53:00.800
 Your view on love, your view on and those are things don't come up in regular conversations.

1:53:01.520 --> 1:53:06.560
 It's so nice that that's something about, see, that's the pushback. There's something about

1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:10.880
 this microphone or maybe it's just the deliberate nature of sitting down. Let's just talk.

1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:17.760
 There is something about the microphone that for me thinks the same with the suit.

1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:22.160
 I'm going to take this moment seriously. I've long forgotten that anyone is listening.

1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:30.240
 And I'm going to try to really listen to another human, first of all. And to also ask

1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:36.800
 the questions that like are really interesting. Like I feel like when I talk to normal people

1:53:36.800 --> 1:53:43.600
 out on the street, I'm not allowed to ask anything. I'm allowed to ask only the more sort of generic

1:53:43.600 --> 1:53:48.960
 things. I think you can ask anything. I'm starting to think that. I think you're allowed to ask

1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:56.320
 anything. I think you're allowed to basically do anything, especially in Texas. Yeah, I think

1:53:56.320 --> 1:54:03.040
 it's okay to ask people. And I think people like it when you ask them. People like to be seen and

1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:10.160
 like to show who they are. As the wind blows again, do you have advice for young people?

1:54:10.160 --> 1:54:18.640
 So you're have a fascinating life journey. Is there advice you can give to people in high

1:54:18.640 --> 1:54:27.760
 school and college about how to have a life like yours in whatever pursuit in terms of

1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:39.120
 success is such a silly word, but just find success or maybe happiness in career or just

1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:45.360
 in life in general. Yeah, the only advice I would have would be to not listen to anyone

1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:52.080
 and to do what you love and to make things that you love, whatever it is. Make your favorite

1:54:52.080 --> 1:54:58.000
 things. Be the audience. You be the audience. Make the thing for you, the audience. And

1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:04.800
 it doesn't really matter what anyone else thinks. And if you have to get a job to support yourself

1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:10.480
 so that you can make your art, that's fine. You can't make art for someone else. You can't

1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:13.680
 make art with someone else in mind. I don't believe. I don't believe it can be good.

1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:22.640
 So what does success feel like? Are you grateful? Are you proud of the work you've done in the past?

1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:28.800
 Or is there some engine of constant dissatisfaction, like self criticism of I could have done better?

1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:36.160
 No, I'm pleased with the work that we did. Excited to keep working. It's fun. I don't

1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:42.640
 know what else I would do with myself because I like making things. It's fun. I feel like it's

1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:49.440
 my reason to be on the planet, so I just keep doing it. Whatever ideas are actually coming

1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:55.680
 from elsewhere and are using your mind as a temporary vehicle, that's their purpose to be

1:55:55.680 --> 1:56:03.760
 on this planet. Your purpose is to procreate and not die and eat regularly enough such that the brain

1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:09.840
 is alive. It's a biological purpose. Yeah. And anything I can do to keep the channel open

1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:15.920
 to allow what wants to come through to come through, I'm a willing channel. It's so interesting

1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:21.440
 because I'm extremely self critical. So you don't have that self criticism harsh, like

1:56:21.440 --> 1:56:27.200
 this could have been better. If it could have been better, I would keep working on it.

1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:31.840
 It's like, if it could be better, it's not done.

1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:40.880
 So when it's done, it's done. Well, it's the best it can be. I've done everything

1:56:40.880 --> 1:56:46.880
 I can to make it the best it can be. And I can't do more than that. So there's nothing to be critical

1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:53.200
 of. I did my very, if you always do, if you always give all of yourself and do your best,

1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:58.080
 which you're capable of doing, you're not, you're, I'm not suggesting that you're capable of doing

1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:03.280
 more than you can do. But whatever it is that you can do, if you've given all of yourself to it,

1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:09.600
 you've done your best. Where is it? Where could there be regret? Yeah. I mean, there could be,

1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:15.360
 you re listen to an album, you listen to it or anything you've created and think, oh, there's

1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:20.480
 so many interesting ideas missed. It's fine though. But that was that moment. It's like,

1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:27.520
 everything is like a, it's almost like a diary entry. Everything we make is a, is a reflection

1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:33.600
 of a moment in time, a window in time. It could be a day. It could be a year. It could be a,

1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:40.800
 you know, it could be whatever window you decide that it is. But if you give it all of yourself

1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:46.880
 and you know, if you're not interested in working it on it anymore, it's done. Now you may decide

1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:51.600
 it's not good enough to share with people and that's fine. But if it's good enough to share with

1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:58.560
 people is no regret looking bad. That's funny. Cause like, think of it as a diary entry. It's

1:57:58.560 --> 1:58:03.920
 hard to look back at a diary entry and say, you know, I did it wrong. I did it wrong. It's impossible.

1:58:03.920 --> 1:58:11.360
 Yeah. And even if it's read by a hundred people, a thousand people, a million people,

1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:17.040
 it's just a diary entry. It doesn't matter. Speaking of doesn't matter. This life is finite.

1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:26.800
 All of us even recruit will be forgotten one day. Do you think about your mortality tomorrow?

1:58:26.800 --> 1:58:35.040
 Yes. Do you think about the finiteness of this thing? Do you think about mortality,

1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:39.600
 about your mortality? Does it make any sense to you? Do you think about death? Are you afraid of

1:58:39.600 --> 1:58:44.800
 death? I don't think about it. I don't think about it very much. Are you afraid?

1:58:47.040 --> 1:58:53.680
 I don't think I'm afraid. I mean, I don't want to die. But I know that that's in the cards and

1:58:53.680 --> 1:58:58.800
 when it happens, it happens. Your nature of not wanting to die is kind of like,

1:58:58.800 --> 1:59:02.880
 you don't want to go to a shady restaurant. You'd like to go to a nicer one. So it's just

1:59:02.880 --> 1:59:07.840
 a preference thing. Well, I want to keep living because I want to do what I like to do. So

1:59:08.720 --> 1:59:14.560
 whatever, whatever, now who knows, whatever comes next, maybe even better. Maybe we're,

1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:19.760
 you know, I don't know. I can't, I can't, I haven't experienced it yet. So who knows?

1:59:19.760 --> 1:59:24.800
 What do you think happens after we die? I believe we go on in some,

1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:28.880
 in some capacity. I don't know what that means, but in the same way that everything

1:59:29.600 --> 1:59:35.600
 recycles, you know, everything comes around. I don't know why we would be different.

1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:41.040
 In some way? In some way. I don't know what that way is. And I don't know that it's

1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:46.320
 in the same being, you know, or in the same grouping of information, whatever that is.

1:59:46.320 --> 1:59:52.160
 But the thing that makes us, us, that information, I imagine goes on.

1:59:52.720 --> 1:59:56.720
 Yes, it does seem like our world here, at least on earth, has like a memory.

1:59:57.760 --> 2:00:01.520
 And just like history, it kind of rhymes. It brings back

2:00:02.480 --> 2:00:08.160
 creations of the past and rifts on them, improvises on top of them. And that,

2:00:08.160 --> 2:00:10.640
 in that way, humanity propagates.

2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:14.640
 I mean, you see it with garbage. You see the like mountains of garbage.

2:00:14.640 --> 2:00:19.440
 It's like, it doesn't really go anywhere. Even when it breaks up, it disintegrates,

2:00:19.440 --> 2:00:22.480
 but it's never really gone. Same.

2:00:23.600 --> 2:00:25.840
 Is there anything in this world you're afraid of?

2:00:26.880 --> 2:00:27.680
 A lot of things.

2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:29.200
 But not death.

2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:33.440
 I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:35.200
 What are you afraid of?

2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:38.720
 Death is more of a question mark. Again, I'm not in any...

2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:39.680
 To be answered.

2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:45.520
 Yeah. I'm not in any hurry for that to happen, but it will happen. And when it does,

2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:46.880
 we get to experience what that is.

2:00:47.920 --> 2:00:51.440
 Okay. Then the big question mark, what's the meaning of this whole thing?

2:00:52.160 --> 2:00:54.720
 It's the meaning of life, recubin.

2:00:56.960 --> 2:00:58.960
 Putting my name on it makes it harder to answer.

2:01:01.040 --> 2:01:02.800
 It's just a diary entry, like we said.

2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:05.680
 It's true. And you will get a different answer tomorrow.

2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:07.680
 Let's see. What's the meaning of life today?

2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:13.680
 And later today, it could be... So for people who don't know,

2:01:15.040 --> 2:01:19.440
 we were maybe thinking maybe meeting in Austin, have some barbecue,

2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:22.880
 and now we're in the middle of nowhere in beautiful West Texas.

2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:27.920
 And we... This is basically a glorified delivery of barbecue

2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:33.440
 to of my favorite barbecue, maybe one of your top favorite barbecues,

2:01:33.440 --> 2:01:38.240
 to one of my favorite humans. So we get to eat some barbecue today.

2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:39.200
 Maybe that's the meaning.

2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:42.880
 Do you have something bigger than barbecue?

2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:45.120
 Barbecue's pretty big.

2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:49.040
 Where's your love for barbecue come from, by the way?

2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:49.840
 Do you... Is this...

2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:52.720
 Well, I was a vegan for 20 something years.

2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:57.040
 And once I found my way back into eating meat,

2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:03.440
 I think barbecue is my favorite of any of the things that I didn't eat for so long.

2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:08.000
 I have to ask you. I almost forgot.

2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:15.440
 So there's an SNL skit with Will Ferrell that he wrote about Don't Fear the Reaper,

2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:19.680
 where Bruce Dickinson is the producer.

2:02:19.680 --> 2:02:21.600
 I always think about you when I see that skit.

2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:23.680
 I don't know why people should definitely watch it.

2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:26.880
 And he demands more cowbell into the mix.

2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:29.440
 And the whole band...

2:02:29.440 --> 2:02:31.040
 That's how I imagine people interact with you.

2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:32.320
 The whole band is really impressed.

2:02:32.320 --> 2:02:34.640
 Like, we get to work with the great Bruce Dickinson.

2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:37.840
 And then it's played by Christopher Walken.

2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:44.320
 And he says, like, fellas, fellas, I put on my pants one leg at a time,

2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:45.440
 just like the rest of you.

2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:49.440
 But once my pants are on, I make gold records.

2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:54.240
 And I just... And then the whole skit continues,

2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:55.920
 and he wants to add more and more cowbell.

2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:59.760
 And Will Ferrell said he wrote that skit because he always heard the song,

2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:02.000
 Don't Fear the Reaper, and there's a distant cowbell.

2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:03.840
 It's very light in the mix.

2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:09.280
 And he's like, I wonder what the story of that cowbell is.

2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:13.040
 Like, if we just look at that one layer, who's that guy that was in there?

2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:18.080
 So, is that basically exactly how your life is?

2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:20.400
 Is Bruce Dickinson from the cowbell?

2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:21.760
 I don't know if you've seen that skit.

2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:25.360
 I don't think it's like that.

2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:26.480
 It's not? Okay.

2:03:26.480 --> 2:03:27.360
 All right.

2:03:27.360 --> 2:03:28.800
 I'm just going to pretend then.

2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:30.960
 Rick, this is a huge honor that you sit with me.

2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:38.320
 I mean, what can I say about how incredible a human you are?

2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:39.920
 You truly are out of this world.

2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:41.840
 And thank you so much for talking today.

2:03:41.840 --> 2:03:42.800
 I'm a great fan.

2:03:42.800 --> 2:03:46.400
 I'm so happy that you agreed to do this with me.

2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:50.160
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Rick Rubin.

2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:53.680
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:57.600
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.

2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:00.320
 Imagination is everything.

2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:03.680
 It is the preview of life's coming attractions.

2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:15.680
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
