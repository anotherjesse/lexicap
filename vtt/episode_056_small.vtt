00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
 The following is a conversation with Judea Pearl,

00:03.200 --> 00:06.640
 a professor at UCLA and a winner of the Touring Award

00:06.640 --> 00:10.640
 that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of Computing.

00:10.640 --> 00:14.400
 He's one of the seminal figures in the field of artificial intelligence,

00:14.400 --> 00:18.720
 computer science, and statistics. He has developed and championed

00:18.720 --> 00:22.640
 probabilistic approaches to AI, including Beijing networks,

00:22.640 --> 00:27.760
 and profound ideas and causality in general. These ideas are important not

00:27.760 --> 00:32.640
 just to AI, but to our understanding and practice of science.

00:32.640 --> 00:37.200
 But in the field of AI, the idea of causality, cause and effect,

00:37.200 --> 00:40.800
 to many, lie at the core of what is currently missing

00:40.800 --> 00:46.000
 and will must be developed in order to build truly intelligent systems.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.680
 For this reason, and many others, his work is worth returning to

00:49.680 --> 00:55.040
 often. I recommend his most recent book called Book of Why that presents key

00:55.040 --> 01:00.320
 ideas from a lifetime of work in a way that is accessible to the general public.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.320
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it,

01:04.320 --> 01:07.760
 subscribe on YouTube, give it 5 stars on Apple Podcasts,

01:11.280 --> 01:17.360
 Alex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N. If you leave a review on Apple Podcasts

01:17.360 --> 01:20.800
 especially, but also Cast Box or comment on YouTube,

01:20.800 --> 01:25.040
 consider mentioning topics, people, ideas, questions, quotes, and science, tech, and

01:25.040 --> 01:29.360
 philosophy that you find interesting, and I'll read them on this podcast.

01:29.360 --> 01:33.680
 I won't call out names, but I love comments with kindness and thoughtfulness in them,

01:33.680 --> 01:37.680
 so I thought I'd share them with you. Someone on YouTube highlighted a quote

01:37.680 --> 01:41.200
 from the conversation with Noam Chomsky, where he said that the

01:41.200 --> 01:46.400
 significance of your life is something you create. I like this line as well.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.960
 On most days, the existentialist approach to life is one I find

01:50.960 --> 01:55.120
 liberating and fulfilling. I recently started doing ads at the

01:55.120 --> 01:58.400
 end of the introduction. I'll do one or two minutes after introducing

01:58.400 --> 02:01.920
 the episode and never any ads in the middle that break the flow of the

02:01.920 --> 02:05.040
 conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't

02:05.040 --> 02:10.400
 hurt the listening experience. This show is presented by Cash App,

02:10.400 --> 02:14.080
 the number one finance app in the App Store. I personally use Cash App to

02:14.080 --> 02:16.960
 have money to friends, but you can also use it to buy,

02:16.960 --> 02:21.920
 sell, and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds. Cash App also has a new investing

02:21.920 --> 02:24.240
 feature. You can buy fractions of a stock,

02:24.240 --> 02:27.840
 say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.

02:27.840 --> 02:32.080
 Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square,

02:32.080 --> 02:36.560
 and member SIPC. I'm excited to be working with Cash App to

02:36.560 --> 02:40.960
 support one of my favorite organizations called First, best known for their first

02:40.960 --> 02:45.600
 robotics and Lego competitions. They educate and inspire hundreds of

02:45.600 --> 02:49.280
 thousands of students in over 110 countries and have a

02:49.280 --> 02:52.240
 perfect rating on charity navigator, which means the

02:52.240 --> 02:55.840
 donated money is used to the maximum effectiveness.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.560
 When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play,

02:58.560 --> 03:04.560
 and use code LEX Podcast, you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10

03:04.560 --> 03:07.760
 to FIRST, which again is an organization that I've

03:07.760 --> 03:12.640
 personally seen inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world.

03:12.640 --> 03:18.000
 And now, here's my conversation with Judea Pearl.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.680
 You mentioned in an interview that science is not a collection of facts

03:21.680 --> 03:26.480
 by constant human struggle with the mysteries of nature.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.080
 What was the first mystery that you can recall that hooked you,

03:30.080 --> 03:34.320
 that kept you in the creos... Oh, the first mystery, that's a good one.

03:34.320 --> 03:41.360
 Yeah, I remember that. I had a fever for three days.

03:41.360 --> 03:46.880
 When I learned about Descartes Analytical Geometry,

03:46.880 --> 03:52.800
 and I found out that you can do all the construction in geometry using algebra,

03:52.800 --> 03:58.640
 and I couldn't get over it. I simply couldn't get out of bed.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.640
 What kind of world does Analytical Geometry unlock?

04:02.640 --> 04:07.200
 Well, it connects algebra with geometry.

04:07.200 --> 04:12.800
 Okay, so Descartes had the idea that geometrical construction

04:12.800 --> 04:18.240
 and geometrical theorems and assumptions can be articulated in the language of

04:18.240 --> 04:23.680
 algebra, which means that all the proof that we did in high

04:23.680 --> 04:28.560
 school trying to prove that the three bisectors

04:28.560 --> 04:35.520
 meet at one point and that, okay, all these can be proven

04:35.520 --> 04:43.440
 by just shuffling around notation. Yeah, that was a traumatic experience.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.000
 Traumatic experience. For me, it was. I'm telling you.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.840
 It's the connection between the different mathematical disciplines that they all

04:49.840 --> 04:52.960
 noted between two different languages.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.280
 Languages. Yeah. So which mathematics discipline is most beautiful? Is

04:57.280 --> 05:01.360
 geometry it for you? Both are beautiful. They have almost the same

05:01.360 --> 05:04.480
 power. But there's a visual element to geometry

05:04.480 --> 05:09.600
 being a visual. It's more transparent. But once you get over

05:09.600 --> 05:13.840
 to algebra, then the linear equation is a straight

05:13.840 --> 05:18.160
 line. This translation is easily absorbed.

05:18.160 --> 05:25.360
 And to pass a tangent to a circle, you know, you have the basic theorems

05:25.360 --> 05:30.880
 and you can do it with algebra. So but the transition from one to another

05:30.880 --> 05:33.280
 was really, I thought that the card was the greatest

05:33.280 --> 05:39.760
 mathematician of all times. So you have been at the, if you think of

05:39.760 --> 05:44.000
 engineering and mathematics as a spectrum. Yes.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.040
 You have been, you have walked casually along this spectrum

05:49.040 --> 05:53.040
 throughout your, throughout your life. You know, a little bit of engineering and

05:53.040 --> 05:57.280
 then, you know, a bit done a little bit of

05:57.280 --> 06:02.240
 mathematics here and there. Not a little bit. I mean, we got a very solid

06:02.240 --> 06:06.960
 background in mathematics because our teachers were geniuses.

06:06.960 --> 06:12.160
 Our teachers came from Germany in the 1930s running away from Hitler.

06:12.160 --> 06:16.400
 They left their careers in Heidelberg and Berlin and came to teach high school

06:16.400 --> 06:21.520
 in Israel. And we were the beneficiary of that experiment.

06:21.520 --> 06:26.640
 So I, and they taught us math the good way. What's a good way to teach math?

06:26.640 --> 06:32.240
 Chronologically. The people. The people behind the theorems.

06:32.240 --> 06:38.960
 Yeah. Their cousins and their nieces and their faces.

06:38.960 --> 06:43.440
 And how they jumped from the bathtub when they screamed Eureka

06:43.440 --> 06:48.560
 and ran naked in town. So you're almost educated as a historian of

06:48.560 --> 06:51.840
 math. No, we just got a glimpse of that history

06:51.840 --> 06:57.600
 together with the theorem. So every exercise in math was connected with the

06:57.600 --> 07:03.360
 person and the time of the person. The period.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.040
 The period also mathematically. Mathematically speaking, yes. Not the

07:07.040 --> 07:13.840
 politics. No. So, and then in, in university,

07:13.840 --> 07:18.640
 you have, you've gone on to do engineering. Yeah. I got a B.S. in engineering and a

07:18.640 --> 07:23.760
 Technion. Right. And then I moved here for

07:23.760 --> 07:28.320
 graduate work. And I got to, I did engineering

07:28.320 --> 07:35.200
 in addition to physics in Radges. And it would combine very nicely with my

07:35.200 --> 07:40.320
 thesis which I did in LCA laboratories and superconductivity.

07:40.320 --> 07:47.040
 And then somehow thought to switch to almost computer science, software, even,

07:47.040 --> 07:51.520
 even not switch but long to become, to get into

07:51.520 --> 07:53.520
 software engineering a little bit. Yes.

07:53.520 --> 07:58.000
 Programming, if you can call it that in the 70s. So there's all these disciplines.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.600
 Yeah. If you were to pick a favor, what,

08:01.600 --> 08:05.520
 in terms of engineering and mathematics, which path do you think

08:05.520 --> 08:10.400
 has more beauty, which path has more power? It's hard to choose, no.

08:10.400 --> 08:16.080
 I enjoy doing physics. I even have a vortex named on my name.

08:16.080 --> 08:23.200
 So I have investment in immortality.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.880
 So what is a vortex? Vortex is in superconductivity.

08:26.880 --> 08:30.720
 In the superconductivity. You have permanent currents swirling around.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.400
 One way or the other, you can have a store one or zero

08:34.400 --> 08:39.600
 for a computer. That's what we worked on in the 1960s in LCA.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.920
 And I discovered a few nice phenomena with the vortices.

08:43.920 --> 08:46.480
 They pushed current and they moved. So that's a pearl vortex.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.240
 Pearl vortex, right? You can google it. Right?

08:50.240 --> 08:55.040
 I didn't know about it, but the physicists picked up on my thesis

08:55.040 --> 09:03.200
 on my PhD thesis and it becomes popular. I mean thin film superconductors

09:03.200 --> 09:06.880
 became important for high temperature superconductors.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.720
 So they call it pearl vortex without my knowledge.

09:10.720 --> 09:16.960
 I discovered it only about 15 years ago. You have footprints in all of the

09:16.960 --> 09:20.880
 sciences. So let's talk about the universe a little bit.

09:20.880 --> 09:25.440
 Is the universe at the lowest level deterministic or stochastic

09:25.440 --> 09:30.080
 in your amateur philosophy view? Put another way, does God play dice?

09:30.080 --> 09:35.200
 We know it is stochastic, right? Today. Today we think it is stochastic.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.800
 Yes. We think because we have the Heisenberg

09:38.800 --> 09:43.600
 uncertainty principle and we have some experiments to

09:43.600 --> 09:47.840
 confirm that. All we have is experiments to confirm it.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.280
 We don't understand why. Why is already...

09:51.280 --> 09:57.120
 You wrote a book about why. Yeah, it's a puzzle.

09:57.120 --> 10:04.800
 It's a puzzle that you have the dice flipping machine or God

10:04.800 --> 10:08.480
 and the result of the flipping

10:08.480 --> 10:12.160
 propagates with the speed faster than the speed of light.

10:12.160 --> 10:21.200
 We can't explain it, okay? But it only governs microscopic phenomena.

10:21.200 --> 10:25.760
 So you don't think of quantum mechanics as useful

10:25.760 --> 10:30.320
 for understanding the nature of reality? No, diversionary.

10:30.320 --> 10:36.560
 So in your thinking the world might as well be deterministic? The world is

10:36.560 --> 10:43.040
 deterministic and as far as the new one firing is concerned

10:43.040 --> 10:48.880
 it is deterministic to first approximation. What about free will?

10:48.880 --> 10:54.800
 Free will is also a nice exercise. Free will is an illusion

10:54.800 --> 11:01.920
 that we AI people are going to solve. So what do you think once we solve it that

11:01.920 --> 11:05.840
 solution will look like? Once we put it in the page?

11:05.840 --> 11:08.800
 First of all it will look like a machine.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.480
 A machine that acts as though it has free will.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.920
 It communicates with other machines as though they have

11:15.920 --> 11:20.320
 free will and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between

11:20.320 --> 11:24.640
 a machine that does and machine that doesn't have free will.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.240
 So the illusion, it propagates the illusion of free will amongst the other

11:28.240 --> 11:33.040
 machines. And faking it is having it, okay?

11:33.040 --> 11:37.120
 That's what Turing tells us all about. Faking intelligence is intelligent

11:37.120 --> 11:43.120
 because it's not easy to fake. It's very hard to fake

11:43.120 --> 11:46.720
 and you can only fake if you have it.

11:46.720 --> 11:53.440
 Yeah, that's such a beautiful statement.

11:53.440 --> 11:59.520
 Yeah, you can't fake it if you don't have it.

11:59.520 --> 12:06.720
 So let's begin at the beginning with the probability

12:06.720 --> 12:10.560
 both philosophically and mathematically. What does it mean to say

12:10.560 --> 12:13.600
 the probability of something happening is

12:13.600 --> 12:20.560
 50%. What is probability? It's a degree of uncertainty that an agent has

12:20.560 --> 12:23.920
 about the world. You're still expressing some knowledge

12:23.920 --> 12:27.760
 in that statement? Of course. The probability is 90%.

12:27.760 --> 12:32.320
 It's absolutely different kind of knowledge and if it is 10%.

12:32.320 --> 12:38.400
 But it's still not solid knowledge? It's solid knowledge.

12:38.400 --> 12:46.160
 If you tell me that 90% assurance smoking will give you lung cancer

12:46.160 --> 12:52.320
 in five years versus 10%, it's a piece of useful knowledge.

12:52.320 --> 12:57.440
 So the statistical view of the universe, why is it useful?

12:57.440 --> 13:01.840
 So we're swimming in complete uncertainty, most of everything.

13:01.840 --> 13:06.000
 It allows you to predict things with a certain probability

13:06.000 --> 13:09.200
 and computing those probabilities are very useful.

13:09.200 --> 13:16.720
 That's the whole idea of prediction and you need prediction to be able to

13:16.720 --> 13:20.080
 survive. If you can't predict the future then you're

13:20.080 --> 13:24.240
 just crossing the street. It will be extremely

13:24.240 --> 13:28.800
 fearful. And so you've done a lot of work in causation

13:28.800 --> 13:33.280
 and so let's let's think about correlation. I started with the

13:33.280 --> 13:36.160
 probability. You started with probability. You've

13:36.160 --> 13:43.840
 invented the Bayesian networks and so we'll dance back and forth

13:43.840 --> 13:50.320
 between these levels of uncertainty. But what is correlation?

13:50.320 --> 13:53.920
 So probability is something happening, it's something,

13:53.920 --> 13:58.240
 but then there's a bunch of things happening and sometimes they happen

13:58.240 --> 14:00.640
 together, sometimes not, they're independent or not.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.520
 So how do you think about correlation of things?

14:03.520 --> 14:07.680
 Correlation occurs when two things vary together over a very long time.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.920
 There's one way of measuring it or when you have a bunch of variables that

14:11.920 --> 14:18.480
 they're all very cohesive. Then because we have a correlation here

14:18.480 --> 14:21.680
 and usually when we think about correlation

14:21.680 --> 14:27.920
 we really think causally. Things cannot be correlated unless there is a reason

14:27.920 --> 14:32.000
 for them to vary together. Why should they vary together?

14:32.000 --> 14:35.440
 If they don't see each other why should they vary together?

14:35.440 --> 14:39.200
 So underlying it somewhere is causation. Yes.

14:39.200 --> 14:45.040
 Hidden in our intuition there is a notion of causation because we cannot grasp

14:45.040 --> 14:52.480
 any other logic except causation. And how does conditional probability

14:52.480 --> 14:57.840
 differ from causation? So what is conditional probability?

14:57.840 --> 15:02.800
 Conditional probability, how things vary, when one of them

15:02.800 --> 15:10.000
 stays the same. Now staying the same means that I have chosen to look only

15:10.000 --> 15:14.720
 of those incidents where the guy has the same value

15:14.720 --> 15:19.280
 as previous one. It's my choice as an experimenter.

15:19.280 --> 15:24.160
 So things that are not correlated before could become correlated.

15:24.160 --> 15:29.120
 Like for instance if I have two coins which are uncorrelated

15:29.120 --> 15:35.520
 and I choose only those flippings experiments in which a bell rings

15:35.520 --> 15:40.720
 and a bell rings when at least one of them is a tail.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.320
 Then suddenly I see correlation between the two coins

15:44.320 --> 15:49.280
 because I only look at the cases where the bell rang.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.760
 You see it's my design with my ignorance essentially

15:53.760 --> 16:01.200
 with my audacity to ignore certain incidents.

16:01.200 --> 16:07.680
 I suddenly create a correlation where it doesn't exist physically.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.360
 Right so that's you just outlined one of the flaws

16:11.360 --> 16:14.880
 of observing the world and trying to infer something

16:14.880 --> 16:17.360
 from the math about the world from looking at the correlation.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.800
 I don't look at it as a flaw. The world works like that.

16:20.800 --> 16:27.840
 But the flaws come if we try to impose

16:27.840 --> 16:34.560
 causal logic on correlation. It doesn't work too well.

16:34.560 --> 16:38.960
 I mean but that's exactly what we do. That's what that has been the majority

16:38.960 --> 16:43.600
 of science. The majority of naive science.

16:43.600 --> 16:47.120
 So the stations know it. The stations know it if you

16:47.120 --> 16:50.960
 condition on a third variable then you can destroy

16:50.960 --> 16:55.520
 or create correlations among two other variables.

16:55.520 --> 16:59.440
 They know it. It's in the data. It's nothing surprising.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.320
 That's why they all dismiss the symptom paradox.

17:02.320 --> 17:07.200
 Ah we know it. They don't know anything about it.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.960
 Well there's there's disciplines like psychology where all the variables are

17:10.960 --> 17:15.120
 hard to account for and so oftentimes there's a leap

17:15.120 --> 17:21.200
 between correlation to causation. You're you're imposing a leap.

17:21.200 --> 17:25.920
 Who is trying to get causation from correlation?

17:25.920 --> 17:30.320
 Not you're not proving causation but you're sort of

17:30.320 --> 17:35.280
 discussing it implying sort of hypothesizing without ability.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.800
 Which discipline do you have in mind? I'll tell you if they are

17:38.800 --> 17:44.160
 obsolete or if they are outdated or they are about to get outdated.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.720
 Yes. Yeah tell me which one do you have in mind.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.920
 Well psychology you know. It's okay what is it SEM?

17:49.920 --> 17:52.800
 It's actually equation. No no I was thinking of applied psychology

17:52.800 --> 17:57.120
 studying. For example we work with human behavior

17:57.120 --> 18:00.880
 and semi autonomous vehicles. How people behave and you have to

18:00.880 --> 18:03.840
 conduct these studies of people driving cars.

18:03.840 --> 18:07.680
 Everything starts with the question. What is the research question?

18:07.680 --> 18:14.240
 What is the research question? The research question. Do people fall asleep

18:14.240 --> 18:21.600
 when the car is driving itself? Do they fall asleep or do they tend to fall

18:21.600 --> 18:25.840
 asleep more frequently? More frequently. Then the car not driving.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.560
 Not driving itself. That's a good question okay.

18:28.560 --> 18:32.320
 And so you measure you put people in the car

18:32.320 --> 18:35.840
 because it's real world. You can't conduct an experiment where you control

18:35.840 --> 18:40.160
 everything. Why can't you? You could. Turn the

18:40.160 --> 18:47.680
 automatic module on and off. Because it's on road public.

18:47.680 --> 18:52.560
 I mean there's aspects to it that's unethical.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.640
 Because it's testing on public roads. So you can only use vehicle.

18:56.640 --> 19:01.120
 They have to the people the drivers themselves have to make that choice

19:01.120 --> 19:06.320
 themselves. And so they regulate that. And so you just

19:06.320 --> 19:10.240
 observe when they drive it autonomously and when they don't.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.040
 And then. But maybe they turn it off when they were very tired.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.240
 Yeah that's kind of thing. But you you don't know those variables.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.280
 Okay so that you have now uncontrolled experiment.

19:19.280 --> 19:23.120
 Uncontrolled experiment. We call it observational study.

19:23.120 --> 19:30.400
 And we form the correlation detected. We have to infer causal relationship.

19:30.400 --> 19:34.720
 Whether it was the automatic piece that caused them to fall asleep.

19:34.720 --> 19:43.920
 Oh okay. So that is an issue that is about 120 years old.

19:43.920 --> 19:49.360
 Yeah. I should only go 100 years old. Okay.

19:49.360 --> 19:55.120
 And oh maybe it's no actually I should say it's 2000 years old.

19:55.120 --> 19:58.480
 Because we have this experiment by Daniel.

19:58.480 --> 20:06.320
 But the Babylonian king. That wanted the

20:06.320 --> 20:11.040
 exile. The people from Israel that were taken

20:11.040 --> 20:17.120
 in exile to Babylon to serve the king. He wanted to serve them king's food.

20:17.120 --> 20:21.200
 Which was meat and Daniel as a good Jew couldn't

20:21.200 --> 20:26.640
 eat a non kosher food. So he asked them to eat vegetarian food.

20:26.640 --> 20:32.080
 But the king overseers says I'm sorry but if the king sees that your

20:32.080 --> 20:39.360
 performance falls below that of other kids you know he's going to kill me.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.760
 Daniel said let's make an experiment. Let's take four of us from Jerusalem.

20:43.760 --> 20:49.040
 Okay give us vegetarian food. Let's take the other guys that

20:49.040 --> 20:52.000
 to eat the king's food and in about a week's time

20:52.000 --> 20:55.360
 we'll test our performance. And you know the answer.

20:55.360 --> 21:00.000
 Of course he did the experiment. And they were

21:00.000 --> 21:04.080
 so much better than the others. And the kings nominated them

21:04.080 --> 21:09.600
 to super position in his king. So it was the first experiment.

21:09.600 --> 21:13.840
 Yes. So there was a very simple it's also the same

21:13.840 --> 21:18.560
 research questions. We want to know vegetarian food.

21:18.560 --> 21:23.440
 Assist or obstruct your your mental ability.

21:23.440 --> 21:30.400
 And okay so let's put the question is very old one.

21:30.400 --> 21:38.000
 Even the democratic said if I could discover one cause

21:38.000 --> 21:44.480
 of things I would rather discuss one cause and be a king of Persia.

21:44.480 --> 21:50.800
 The task of discovering causes was in the mind of ancient people

21:50.800 --> 21:57.200
 from many many years ago. But the mathematics of doing that

21:57.200 --> 22:04.400
 was only developed in the 1920s. So science has left us often.

22:04.400 --> 22:10.080
 Okay science has not provided us with the mathematics to capture the idea of

22:10.080 --> 22:16.400
 x causes y and y does not cause x. Because all the questions of physics

22:16.400 --> 22:21.600
 are symmetrical algebraic. The equality sign goes both ways.

22:21.600 --> 22:25.440
 Okay let's look at machine learning. Machine learning today if you look at

22:25.440 --> 22:29.600
 deep neural networks you can think of it as

22:29.600 --> 22:34.480
 kind of conditional probability estimators.

22:34.480 --> 22:39.200
 Beautiful. So where did you say that?

22:39.200 --> 22:43.520
 Conditional probability estimators. None of the machine learning people

22:43.520 --> 22:51.120
 clubbled you. Attacked you. Listen most people and this is

22:51.120 --> 22:54.560
 why this today's conversation I think is interesting is most people would agree

22:54.560 --> 22:57.040
 with you. There's certain aspects that are just

22:57.040 --> 23:00.800
 effective today but we're going to hit a wall and there's a lot of

23:00.800 --> 23:03.680
 ideas. I think you're very right that we're

23:03.680 --> 23:07.120
 going to have to return to about causality.

23:07.120 --> 23:13.040
 Let's try to explore it. Let's even take a step back.

23:13.040 --> 23:16.800
 You've invented Bayesian networks

23:17.440 --> 23:22.240
 that look awfully a lot like they express something like causation but they

23:22.240 --> 23:27.120
 don't. Not necessarily. So how do we turn

23:27.120 --> 23:33.200
 Bayesian networks into expressing causation? How do we build causal networks?

23:33.200 --> 23:38.160
 This A causes B, B causes C. How do we start to infer that kind of

23:38.160 --> 23:41.360
 thing? We start asking ourselves a question

23:41.360 --> 23:47.520
 what are the factors that would determine the value of X? X could be

23:47.520 --> 23:55.040
 blood pressure, death, hunger. But these are hypotheses

23:55.040 --> 23:58.080
 that we propose. Hypothesis. Everything which has to do with

23:58.080 --> 24:02.480
 causality comes from a theory.

24:03.440 --> 24:07.920
 The difference is only how you interrogate the theory you have

24:07.920 --> 24:13.680
 in your mind. So it still needs the human expert to propose.

24:13.680 --> 24:18.720
 Right. You need the human expert to specify

24:18.720 --> 24:22.640
 the initial model. Initial model could be very

24:22.640 --> 24:29.040
 qualitative. Just who listens to whom? By whom listen to I mean

24:29.040 --> 24:33.920
 one variable listen to the other. So I say okay the tide is listening to the

24:33.920 --> 24:42.160
 moon and not to the rooster crow.

24:42.160 --> 24:46.800
 And so far this is our understanding of the world in which we live.

24:46.800 --> 24:53.360
 Scientific understanding of reality. We have to start there.

24:53.360 --> 24:57.680
 Because if we don't know how to handle cause and effect

24:57.680 --> 25:03.040
 relationship when we do have a model and we certainly do not know how to

25:03.040 --> 25:07.120
 handle it when we don't have a model. So let's start first.

25:07.120 --> 25:13.440
 In AI slogan is representation first, discovery second.

25:13.440 --> 25:17.120
 But if I give you all the information that you need

25:17.120 --> 25:21.440
 can you do anything useful with it? That is the first representation.

25:21.440 --> 25:24.880
 How do you represent it? I give you all the knowledge in the world. How do you

25:24.880 --> 25:30.640
 represent it? When you represent it I ask you

25:30.640 --> 25:35.200
 can you infer x or y or z? Can you answer certain queries?

25:35.200 --> 25:42.000
 Is it complex? Is it polynomial? All the computer science exercises we do

25:42.000 --> 25:47.200
 once you give me a representation for my knowledge.

25:47.200 --> 25:52.480
 Then you can ask me now I understand how to represent things. How do I discover

25:52.480 --> 25:56.560
 them? At the second everything. So first of all I should echo the

25:56.560 --> 26:01.680
 statement that mathematics and the current much of the machine learning

26:01.680 --> 26:05.280
 world has not considered causation that A

26:05.280 --> 26:14.160
 causes B just in anything. That seems like a

26:14.160 --> 26:17.280
 non obvious thing that you think we would have

26:17.280 --> 26:20.960
 really acknowledged it but we haven't. So we have to put that on the table.

26:20.960 --> 26:27.280
 So knowledge how hard is it to create a knowledge from which

26:27.280 --> 26:32.240
 to work? In certain area it's easy because we have

26:32.240 --> 26:39.200
 only four or five major variables and an epidemiologist

26:39.200 --> 26:43.120
 or an economist can put them down.

26:43.120 --> 26:54.160
 Minimum wage, unemployment, policy, x, y, z and start collecting data

26:54.160 --> 26:58.080
 and quantify the parameters that were left

26:58.080 --> 27:03.920
 unquantified with the initial knowledge. That's the

27:03.920 --> 27:10.160
 routine work that you find in experimental psychology,

27:10.160 --> 27:14.800
 in economics, everywhere in the health science.

27:14.800 --> 27:19.840
 That's a routine thing but I should emphasize you should start with a

27:19.840 --> 27:24.800
 research question. What do you want to estimate?

27:24.800 --> 27:29.120
 Once you have that you have to have a language of expressing what you want to

27:29.120 --> 27:34.160
 estimate. You think it's easy? No. So we can talk about two things. I

27:34.160 --> 27:39.120
 think one is how the science of

27:39.120 --> 27:45.520
 causation is very useful for

27:45.520 --> 27:48.960
 answering certain questions and then the other is how do we create

27:48.960 --> 27:53.440
 intelligent systems that need to reason with causation.

27:53.440 --> 27:57.520
 So if my research question is how do I pick up this water bottle

27:57.520 --> 28:04.000
 from the table? All the knowledge is required to be able to

28:04.000 --> 28:07.280
 do that. How do we construct that knowledge base?

28:07.280 --> 28:11.840
 Do we return back to the problem that we didn't solve

28:11.840 --> 28:15.280
 in the 80s with expert systems? Do we have to solve that problem

28:15.280 --> 28:19.520
 of automated construction of knowledge?

28:19.520 --> 28:26.560
 You're talking about the task of eliciting knowledge from an export.

28:26.560 --> 28:30.400
 Task of eliciting knowledge from an export or the self discovery of

28:30.400 --> 28:36.560
 more knowledge, more and more knowledge. So automating the building of

28:36.560 --> 28:42.400
 knowledge as much as possible. It's a different game in the causal domain

28:42.400 --> 28:46.960
 because it's essentially the same thing. You have to

28:46.960 --> 28:49.920
 start with some knowledge and you're trying to

28:49.920 --> 28:57.200
 enrich it. But you don't enrich it by asking for more rules. You enrich it by

28:57.200 --> 29:01.680
 asking for the data, to look at the data and quantifying

29:01.680 --> 29:06.320
 and ask queries that you couldn't answer when you started.

29:06.320 --> 29:12.640
 You couldn't because the question is quite complex and it's not

29:12.640 --> 29:18.880
 within the capability of ordinary cognition, of

29:18.880 --> 29:23.040
 ordinary person or ordinary expert even to answer.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.880
 So what kind of questions do you think we can start to answer?

29:26.880 --> 29:31.840
 Even a simple one. Suppose I start with an easy one.

29:31.840 --> 29:37.520
 What's the effect of a drug on recovery?

29:37.520 --> 29:40.800
 What is the aspirin that caused my headache to

29:40.800 --> 29:44.480
 be cured or what is the television program

29:44.480 --> 29:48.640
 or the good news I received? This is already

29:48.640 --> 29:53.600
 a difficult question because it's finding cause from effect.

29:53.600 --> 29:57.600
 The easy one is find effects from cause. That's right.

29:57.600 --> 30:00.800
 So first you construct a model saying that this is an important research

30:00.800 --> 30:04.080
 question. This is an important question. Then you...

30:04.080 --> 30:07.600
 I didn't construct a model yet. I just said it's an important question.

30:07.600 --> 30:12.160
 And the first exercise is express it mathematically.

30:12.160 --> 30:16.880
 What do you want to do? Like if I tell you what will be the effect

30:16.880 --> 30:21.280
 of taking this drug? You have to say that in mathematics.

30:21.280 --> 30:27.600
 How do you say that? Yes. Can you write down the question? Not the answer.

30:27.600 --> 30:32.320
 I want to find the effect of the drug on my headache.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.840
 Write it down. That's where the do calculus comes in.

30:35.840 --> 30:39.840
 Yes. Do operator. What do you do operator? Do operator.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.280
 Which is nice. It's the difference between association and intervention.

30:43.280 --> 30:48.720
 Very beautifully sort of constructed. Yeah. So we have a do operator.

30:48.720 --> 30:53.600
 So do calculus connected on the do operator itself connects

30:53.600 --> 30:57.760
 the operation of doing to something that we can see.

30:57.760 --> 31:01.600
 Right. So as opposed to the purely observing

31:01.600 --> 31:08.160
 you're making the choice to change a variable. That's what it expresses.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.840
 And then the way that we interpret it

31:11.840 --> 31:15.280
 and the mechanism by which we take your query

31:15.280 --> 31:18.560
 and we translate it into something that we can work with

31:18.560 --> 31:23.200
 is by giving it semantics. Saying that you have a model of the world

31:23.200 --> 31:26.720
 and you cut off all the incoming error into x

31:26.720 --> 31:30.640
 and you're looking now in the modified mutilated model

31:30.640 --> 31:36.240
 you ask for the probability of y. That is interpretation of doing x.

31:36.240 --> 31:40.160
 Because by doing things you liberate them

31:40.160 --> 31:44.000
 from all influences that acted upon them

31:44.000 --> 31:49.920
 earlier and you subject them to the tyranny of your muscles.

31:49.920 --> 31:55.600
 So you remove all the questions about causality by doing them.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.960
 So there's one level of questions. Yeah.

31:58.960 --> 32:02.640
 Answer questions about what will happen if you do things. If you do. If you drink

32:02.640 --> 32:05.200
 the coffee or if you take the asthma. Right.

32:05.200 --> 32:11.200
 So how do we get the doing data?

32:11.200 --> 32:16.080
 Now the question is if we cannot run experiments.

32:16.080 --> 32:20.800
 Right. Then we have to rely on observational study.

32:20.800 --> 32:24.320
 So first we could start to interrupt. We could run an experiment

32:24.320 --> 32:28.080
 where we do something. Where we drink the coffee and don't. And this

32:28.080 --> 32:31.760
 the the do operator allows you to sort of be systematic about expressing.

32:31.760 --> 32:36.000
 To imagine how the experiment will look like even though we cannot

32:36.000 --> 32:40.480
 physically and technologically conduct it. I'll give you an example.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.880
 What is the effect of blood pressure on mortality?

32:44.880 --> 32:49.200
 I cannot go down into your vein and change your blood pressure.

32:49.200 --> 32:54.960
 But I can ask the question. Which means I can even have a model of your body.

32:54.960 --> 33:01.840
 I can imagine the effect of your how the blood pressure

33:01.840 --> 33:08.400
 change will affect your mortality. How I go into the model and I conduct this

33:08.400 --> 33:13.280
 surgery about the blood pressure. Even though

33:13.280 --> 33:19.680
 physically I can do I cannot do it. Let me ask the quantum mechanics question.

33:19.680 --> 33:25.920
 Does the doing change the observation? Meaning the surgery of changing the

33:25.920 --> 33:31.120
 blood pressure is I mean no the surgery is

33:31.120 --> 33:39.440
 very delicate. Very delicate. Incisive and delicate.

33:39.440 --> 33:47.040
 Which means do x means I'm going to touch only x.

33:47.040 --> 33:52.960
 Directly into x. So that means that I change only things which

33:52.960 --> 33:57.760
 depends on x by virtue of x changing. But I don't depend

33:57.760 --> 34:01.600
 things which are not depends on x. Like I wouldn't

34:01.600 --> 34:06.880
 change your sex or your age. I just change your blood pressure.

34:06.880 --> 34:11.760
 So in the case of blood pressure it may be difficult or impossible to construct

34:11.760 --> 34:16.080
 such an experiment. No physically yes but hypothetically

34:16.080 --> 34:20.640
 no. If we have a model that is what the model is for.

34:20.640 --> 34:26.720
 So you conduct surgeries on a model you take it apart put it back

34:26.720 --> 34:30.560
 that's the idea of a model. It's the idea of thinking counter factually

34:30.560 --> 34:34.960
 imagining and that's the idea of creativity.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.920
 So by constructing that model you can start to infer

34:37.920 --> 34:44.800
 if the higher the blood pressure leads to mortality

34:44.800 --> 34:49.280
 which increases or decreases. I construct the model I can still

34:49.280 --> 34:53.840
 not answer it. I have to see if I have enough information in the model that

34:53.840 --> 34:58.240
 would allow me to find out the effects of intervention

34:58.240 --> 35:04.400
 from a noninterventional study from observation hands off study.

35:04.400 --> 35:11.200
 So what's needed? We need to have assumptions about who

35:11.200 --> 35:16.240
 affects whom. If the if the graph had a certain property

35:16.240 --> 35:20.400
 the answer is yes you can get it from observational study.

35:20.400 --> 35:25.520
 If the graph is too messy bushy bushy the answer is no you cannot.

35:25.520 --> 35:31.120
 Then you need to find either different kind of observation that you haven't

35:31.120 --> 35:37.360
 considered or one experiment. So basically does that

35:37.360 --> 35:41.760
 that puts a lot of pressure on you to encode wisdom into that graph?

35:41.760 --> 35:45.600
 Correct. But you don't have to encode

35:45.600 --> 35:51.200
 more than what you know. God forbid if you put the like economists are doing that

35:51.200 --> 35:54.560
 they call identifying assumptions they put assumptions even they don't

35:54.560 --> 35:57.840
 prevail in the world they put assumptions so they can

35:57.840 --> 36:02.160
 identify things. But the problem is yes beautifully put but the problem is you

36:02.160 --> 36:07.680
 don't know what you don't know. So you know what you don't know because

36:07.680 --> 36:11.760
 if you don't know you say it's possible it's possible

36:11.760 --> 36:19.920
 that x affect the traffic tomorrow. It's possible you put down an error

36:19.920 --> 36:22.560
 which says it's possible every error in the graph

36:22.560 --> 36:26.240
 says it's possible. So there's not a significant cost to adding

36:26.240 --> 36:30.880
 errors that the more error you add the better the less

36:30.880 --> 36:34.800
 likely you are to identify things from purely

36:34.800 --> 36:41.200
 observational data. So if the whole world is bushy

36:41.200 --> 36:45.280
 and everybody affects everybody else

36:45.280 --> 36:49.040
 the answer is you can answer it ahead of time

36:49.040 --> 36:54.800
 I cannot answer my query from observational data I have to go to

36:54.800 --> 36:58.320
 experiments. So you talk about machine learning

36:58.320 --> 37:03.200
 is essentially learning by association or reasoning by association

37:03.200 --> 37:06.960
 and this due calculus is allowing for intervention

37:06.960 --> 37:12.320
 I like that word but action. So you also talk about counterfactuals

37:12.320 --> 37:17.280
 and trying to sort of understand the difference in counterfactuals and

37:17.280 --> 37:22.640
 intervention what's the first what is counterfactuals and

37:22.640 --> 37:29.680
 why are they useful why are they especially useful as

37:29.680 --> 37:34.640
 opposed to just reasoning what what affect actions have.

37:34.640 --> 37:40.000
 What kind of factual contains what we normally call explanations.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.040
 Can you give an example of a counterfactual? If I tell you that

37:43.040 --> 37:47.600
 acting one way affects something I didn't explain anything yet

37:47.600 --> 37:55.200
 but if I if I ask you was it the aspirin that cure my headache

37:55.200 --> 37:58.560
 I'm asking for explanation what cure my headache

37:58.560 --> 38:03.360
 and putting a finger on aspirin

38:03.360 --> 38:08.160
 provide explanation it was aspirin it was responsible

38:08.160 --> 38:14.640
 for your headache going away if if you didn't take the aspirin you would

38:14.640 --> 38:19.440
 still have a headache. So by by saying if I didn't take

38:19.440 --> 38:22.640
 aspirin I would have a headache you're thereby saying

38:22.640 --> 38:26.080
 that aspirin is the thing that removes the headache.

38:26.080 --> 38:30.320
 Yes but you have to have another important information

38:30.320 --> 38:34.480
 I took the aspirin and my headache is gun

38:34.480 --> 38:38.000
 it's very important information now I'm reasoning backward

38:38.000 --> 38:44.320
 and I said what is the aspirin yeah by considering what would have happened

38:44.320 --> 38:47.760
 if everything else is the same but I didn't take aspirin that's right so you

38:47.760 --> 38:53.440
 know that things took place you know Joe killed Schmo

38:53.440 --> 38:59.200
 and Schmo would be alive had John not used his gun

38:59.200 --> 39:04.320
 okay so that is the counterfactual it had a conflict

39:04.320 --> 39:08.240
 it has a conflict here or clash between

39:08.240 --> 39:15.840
 observed fact that he he did shoot okay and the hypothetical

39:15.840 --> 39:19.680
 predicate which says had he not shot you have a clash

39:19.680 --> 39:25.360
 logical clash they cannot exist together that's the counterfactual and that

39:25.360 --> 39:31.120
 is the source of our explanation of our the idea of responsibility

39:31.120 --> 39:37.120
 regret and free will yeah so it certainly seems

39:37.120 --> 39:41.120
 that's the highest level of reasoning right yes and philis is do it all the

39:41.120 --> 39:44.800
 time who does it all the time physicist physicist

39:44.800 --> 39:49.440
 in every equation of physics let's say you have a hook's law

39:49.440 --> 39:53.200
 and you put one kilogram on the spring and the spring is

39:53.200 --> 39:57.200
 one meter and you say had this weight been two

39:57.200 --> 40:01.920
 kilogram the spring would have been twice as long

40:01.920 --> 40:05.440
 it's no problem for physicists to say that

40:05.440 --> 40:10.080
 accepted mathematics is only is in the form of equation

40:10.080 --> 40:17.040
 okay equating the weight proportionality constant and the length of the

40:17.040 --> 40:22.240
 string so you don't have the asymmetry in the

40:22.240 --> 40:26.720
 equation of physics although every physicist things counterfactually

40:26.720 --> 40:31.040
 ask high school kids had the weight been three kilograms

40:31.040 --> 40:35.040
 what will be the length of the spring they can answer it immediately

40:35.040 --> 40:38.720
 because they do the counterfactual processing in their mind

40:38.720 --> 40:42.160
 and then they put it into equation algebraic equation

40:42.160 --> 40:46.560
 and they solve it okay but the robot cannot do that

40:46.560 --> 40:53.040
 how do you make a robot learn these relationships and why you would learn

40:53.040 --> 40:57.040
 suppose you tell him can you do it so before you go learning

40:57.040 --> 41:02.800
 yeah you have to ask yourself suppose that gives more information

41:02.800 --> 41:07.680
 can the robot perform a task that i asked him to perform

41:07.680 --> 41:12.080
 can he reason and say no it wasn't the aspirin it was the good news you

41:12.080 --> 41:16.880
 received on the phone right because well

41:16.880 --> 41:23.600
 unless the robot had a model a causal model of the world

41:23.600 --> 41:27.360
 right right i'm sorry i have to linger on this but now we have to linger and we

41:27.360 --> 41:29.760
 have to say how do we how do we do it how do we build

41:29.760 --> 41:36.320
 yes how do we build a causal model without a team of human experts

41:36.320 --> 41:39.440
 running around why don't you go to learning right away

41:39.440 --> 41:43.040
 you're too much involved with learning because i like babies babies learn fast

41:43.040 --> 41:47.680
 i forgot how they do it good yeah that's another question

41:47.680 --> 41:51.600
 how do the babies come out with the counterfactual model of the world

41:51.600 --> 41:55.440
 and babies do that yeah they know how to play with

41:55.440 --> 41:59.360
 in the crib they know which balls hits another one

41:59.360 --> 42:06.720
 and so they learn it by playful manipulation of the world

42:06.720 --> 42:13.600
 yes there's a simple world involved only toys and balls and chimes

42:13.600 --> 42:17.120
 but it's a if you think about it's a complex world

42:17.120 --> 42:21.840
 we take for granted uh how complicated and kids do it by

42:21.840 --> 42:30.800
 playful manipulation plus parent guidance pure wisdom and he'll say

42:30.800 --> 42:38.880
 they meet each other can they say you you shouldn't have taken my toy

42:38.880 --> 42:42.880
 right but and they these multiple sources of

42:42.880 --> 42:47.920
 information they're able to integrate yeah so the challenge is about how to

42:47.920 --> 42:51.920
 integrate how to form these causal

42:51.920 --> 42:55.520
 relationship from different sources of data correct

42:55.520 --> 43:01.280
 so how how how much is the information is it to play how much causal

43:01.280 --> 43:05.680
 information is required to be able to play in the crib

43:05.680 --> 43:09.680
 with different objects i don't know i haven't

43:09.680 --> 43:13.120
 experimented with the crib okay not a crib picking up

43:13.120 --> 43:16.880
 it's a very interesting manipulating physical objects on this very

43:16.880 --> 43:23.600
 opening the pages of a book all the tasks the physical manipulation tasks

43:23.600 --> 43:27.920
 do you have a sense because my sense is the world is extremely complicated

43:27.920 --> 43:31.520
 it's extremely complicated i agree and i don't know how to organize it because

43:31.520 --> 43:35.280
 i've been spoiled by easy problems such as

43:35.280 --> 43:40.960
 cancer and death okay first we have to start

43:40.960 --> 43:45.200
 no but it's easy the easy in the sense that you have only

43:45.200 --> 43:50.880
 20 variables and they are just variables are not mechanics

43:50.880 --> 43:55.040
 okay it's easy you just put them on the graph and they

43:55.040 --> 44:01.200
 they speak to you yeah and you you're providing a methodology for

44:01.200 --> 44:05.040
 letting them speak yeah i'm working only in the abstract

44:05.040 --> 44:11.760
 the abstract knowledge in knowledge out data in between

44:11.760 --> 44:15.040
 now can we take a leap to try and to learn

44:15.040 --> 44:20.560
 in this very when it's not 20 variables but 20 million variables

44:20.560 --> 44:25.680
 trying to learn causation in this world not learn but

44:25.680 --> 44:29.200
 somehow construct models i mean it seems like you would only have

44:29.200 --> 44:33.760
 be able to learn because constructing it manually

44:33.760 --> 44:37.760
 would be too difficult do you have ideas of

44:37.760 --> 44:41.120
 i think it's a matter of combining simple models

44:41.120 --> 44:45.360
 for many many sources for many many disciplines

44:45.360 --> 44:51.760
 and many metaphors metaphors are the basics of human intelligence basis

44:51.760 --> 44:55.600
 yeah so how do you think of about a metaphor in terms of its use in human

44:55.600 --> 45:01.760
 intelligence metaphors is an expert system

45:01.760 --> 45:07.280
 an expert it's mapping problem

45:07.280 --> 45:13.680
 with which you are not familiar to a problem with which you are familiar

45:13.680 --> 45:20.720
 like i give you a good example the greek believed that the sky is an opaque

45:20.720 --> 45:25.840
 shell it's not really a space infinite space

45:25.840 --> 45:30.480
 it's an opaque shell and the stars are holes

45:30.480 --> 45:35.040
 poked in the shells through which you see the eternal light

45:35.040 --> 45:40.080
 it was a metaphor why because they understand how you poke holes in the

45:40.080 --> 45:44.480
 shells okay they're not they were not familiar with

45:44.480 --> 45:50.720
 infinite space okay and so and we are walking on a

45:50.720 --> 45:55.200
 shell of a turtle and if you get too close to the edge you're gonna fall down

45:55.200 --> 46:00.640
 to Hades or whatever yeah and that's a metaphor

46:00.640 --> 46:07.120
 it's not true but this kind of metaphor enables Aristoteles

46:07.120 --> 46:13.280
 to measure the radius of the earth because he said come on if we are

46:13.280 --> 46:16.960
 walking on a turtle shell then a ray of light

46:16.960 --> 46:20.560
 coming to this angle will be different this place

46:20.560 --> 46:24.160
 will be different angle that's coming to this place i know the distance i'll

46:24.160 --> 46:30.320
 measure the two angles and then i have the radius of the shell of the

46:30.320 --> 46:38.320
 of the turtle okay and he did and he found his measurements

46:38.320 --> 46:43.120
 were very close to the measurements we have today

46:43.120 --> 46:48.480
 through the year what six thousand and seven hundred

46:48.480 --> 46:55.920
 seven hundred kilometers of the earth that's something that would not occur

46:55.920 --> 47:01.840
 to Babylonian astronomer even though the Babylonian experiments

47:01.840 --> 47:04.560
 were the machine learning people of the time

47:04.560 --> 47:08.800
 they fit curves and they could predict the

47:08.800 --> 47:13.360
 eclipse of the moon much more accurately than the Greek

47:13.360 --> 47:19.120
 because they fit curve okay that's a different metaphor

47:19.120 --> 47:24.240
 something that you're familiar with a game a turtle shell okay

47:24.240 --> 47:30.960
 what does it mean if you are familiar familiar means that answers to certain

47:30.960 --> 47:35.520
 questions are explicit you don't have to derive them

47:35.520 --> 47:39.600
 and they were made explicit because somewhere in the past

47:39.600 --> 47:45.600
 you've constructed a model of that you're familiar with so the child is

47:45.600 --> 47:49.920
 familiar with billiard balls yes so the child could predict that if

47:49.920 --> 47:54.480
 you let loose of one ball the other one will bounce off

47:54.480 --> 48:01.840
 these are you obtain that by familiarity familiarity is answering

48:01.840 --> 48:05.760
 questions and you store the answer explicitly

48:05.760 --> 48:09.600
 you don't have to derive them so this is idea for metaphor

48:09.600 --> 48:13.360
 all our life all our intelligence is built around metaphors

48:13.360 --> 48:16.880
 mapping from the unfamiliar to the familiar but

48:16.880 --> 48:21.280
 the marriage between the two is a tough thing which i

48:21.280 --> 48:26.800
 which we haven't been able to algorithmize so you think of that

48:26.800 --> 48:32.000
 process of because of using metaphor to leap from one place to another

48:32.000 --> 48:35.840
 we can call it reasoning is it a kind of reasoning

48:35.840 --> 48:40.800
 it is reasoning by metaphor metaphor for metaphor do you

48:40.800 --> 48:46.560
 think of that as learning so learning is a popular terminology today in a

48:46.560 --> 48:49.600
 narrow sense it is it is it is definitely a

48:49.600 --> 48:53.040
 so you may not okay right one of the most important

48:53.040 --> 48:57.520
 learning taking something which theoretically is drivable

48:57.520 --> 49:04.880
 and store it in accessible format i'll give an example chess

49:04.880 --> 49:12.640
 okay finding winning winning starting moving chess

49:12.640 --> 49:21.040
 is hard but uh it is there is an answer

49:21.040 --> 49:25.840
 either there is a winning move for white or there isn't or there is a draw

49:25.840 --> 49:33.520
 okay so it is the answer to that is available for the rule of the games

49:33.520 --> 49:37.600
 but we don't know the answer so what does the chess master have that we don't

49:37.600 --> 49:41.920
 have he has stored explicitly an evaluation of

49:41.920 --> 49:46.080
 certain complex pattern of the board we don't have it

49:46.080 --> 49:50.880
 ordinary people like me i don't know about you

49:50.880 --> 49:54.880
 i'm not a chess master so for me i have to derive

49:54.880 --> 50:00.160
 yes things that for him is explicit he has seen it before

50:00.160 --> 50:04.400
 or you've seen the pattern before or similar pattern you see metaphor

50:04.400 --> 50:13.360
 yeah and he generalized and said don't move is a dangerous move

50:13.360 --> 50:17.520
 it's just that's not in the game of chess but in the game of

50:17.520 --> 50:22.400
 billiard balls we humans are able to initially derive very effectively and

50:22.400 --> 50:26.960
 then reasoned by metaphor very effectively and make it look so easy

50:26.960 --> 50:32.320
 and it makes one wonder how hard is it to build it in a machine

50:32.320 --> 50:40.560
 so in your sense how far away are we to be able to construct

50:40.560 --> 50:45.600
 i don't know i'm not a futurist i can all i can tell you is

50:45.600 --> 50:50.320
 that we are making tremendous progress in the causal reasoning

50:50.320 --> 50:58.800
 a domain something that i even dare to call it revolution

50:58.800 --> 51:05.680
 the causal revolution because what we have achieved in the past

51:05.680 --> 51:10.720
 three decades is something that

51:10.720 --> 51:14.240
 dwarf everything that was derived in the entire

51:14.240 --> 51:18.960
 history so there's an excitement about current machine learning

51:18.960 --> 51:23.920
 methodologies and there's really important good work you're doing

51:23.920 --> 51:31.440
 in causal inference where do the word what is the future

51:31.440 --> 51:35.040
 where do these worlds collide and what does that look like

51:35.040 --> 51:38.800
 first they're gonna work without collisions

51:38.800 --> 51:44.000
 it's gonna work in harmony harmony it's not the human is going to

51:44.000 --> 51:51.600
 to jumpstart the exercise by providing qualitative

51:51.600 --> 51:56.480
 noncommitting models of how the universe works

51:56.480 --> 52:02.480
 how in reality the domain of discourse

52:02.480 --> 52:06.720
 works the machine is going to take over from that point of view

52:06.720 --> 52:11.760
 and derive whatever the calculus says can be derived

52:11.760 --> 52:16.640
 namely quantitative answer to our questions

52:16.640 --> 52:21.200
 these are complex questions i'll give you some example of complex question

52:21.200 --> 52:28.000
 that will bugle your mind if you think about it

52:28.000 --> 52:35.680
 you take result of studies in diverse population under diverse condition

52:35.680 --> 52:42.400
 and you may infer the cause effect of a new population which doesn't even

52:42.400 --> 52:46.240
 resemble any of the one studied and you do that

52:46.240 --> 52:52.480
 by do calculus you do that by generalizing from one study to another

52:52.480 --> 52:56.960
 see what's what's common with Beato what is different

52:56.960 --> 53:01.040
 let's ignore the differences and pull out the commonality

53:01.040 --> 53:04.080
 and you do it over maybe a hundred hospitals

53:04.080 --> 53:09.600
 around the world from that you can get really

53:09.600 --> 53:14.880
 mileage from big data it's not only you have many samples

53:14.880 --> 53:20.560
 you have many sources of data so that that's a really powerful thing

53:20.560 --> 53:24.080
 i think for especially for medical applications i mean

53:24.080 --> 53:28.400
 cure cancer right that's how from data you can cure cancer

53:28.400 --> 53:31.440
 so we're talking about causation which is the temporal

53:31.440 --> 53:37.920
 temporal relationships between things not only temporal it was structural and

53:37.920 --> 53:42.160
 temporal temporal enough temporal presence by

53:42.160 --> 53:48.800
 itself cannot replace causation is temporal precedence

53:48.800 --> 53:52.080
 the error of time in physics it's important it's necessary

53:52.080 --> 53:58.240
 it's important yes is it yes i never seen cause

53:58.240 --> 54:02.800
 propagate backward but if we call if we use the word

54:02.800 --> 54:06.960
 cause but there's relationships that are timeless

54:06.960 --> 54:10.640
 i suppose that's still forward in the era of time but

54:10.640 --> 54:14.800
 the are there relationships logical relationships

54:14.800 --> 54:18.480
 that fit into the structure

54:18.480 --> 54:21.840
 sure the whole do calculate this logical relationship

54:21.840 --> 54:26.240
 that doesn't require a temporal it has just a condition that

54:26.240 --> 54:30.480
 it's you're not traveling back in time yes

54:30.480 --> 54:34.960
 correct so it's really a generalization of

54:34.960 --> 54:41.680
 a powerful generalization uh of what boolean logic yeah boolean logic

54:41.680 --> 54:48.640
 yes that is sort of simply put and allows us to

54:48.640 --> 54:54.480
 uh you know reason reason about the order of events the source the

54:54.480 --> 54:57.920
 not about between we're not deriving the order of event

54:57.920 --> 55:01.280
 we are given cause effects relationship okay

55:01.280 --> 55:08.800
 they ought to be obeying the the time precedence relationship

55:08.800 --> 55:12.400
 we are given that and now that we ask questions about

55:12.400 --> 55:16.240
 other causal relationship that could be derived from the

55:16.240 --> 55:20.000
 initial ones but were not given to us explicitly

55:20.000 --> 55:26.320
 yeah like the case of the firing squad i give you

55:26.320 --> 55:33.760
 in the first chapter and i ask what if rifleman a decline to shoot

55:33.760 --> 55:37.760
 would the prisoners still be dead

55:37.760 --> 55:41.920
 to decline to shoot it means that disobey order

55:41.920 --> 55:48.080
 and the the rule of the games where that he is a

55:48.080 --> 55:53.200
 obedient and marksman okay that's how you start that's the initial

55:53.200 --> 55:56.560
 order but now you ask question about breaking the rules

55:56.560 --> 56:03.440
 what if he decided not to pull the trigger he just became a pacifist

56:03.440 --> 56:07.440
 and you can you and i can answer that the other rifleman would have

56:07.440 --> 56:12.080
 killed him okay i want the machine to do that

56:12.080 --> 56:17.600
 is it so hard to ask machine to do that it's just a simple task

56:17.600 --> 56:21.040
 but if they have a calculus for that yes yeah

56:21.040 --> 56:24.240
 but the curiosity the natural curiosity for me is

56:24.240 --> 56:27.920
 that yes you're absolutely correct and important

56:27.920 --> 56:31.040
 and it's hard to believe that we haven't done this

56:31.040 --> 56:35.840
 seriously extensively already a long time ago so this

56:35.840 --> 56:38.880
 this is really important work but i also want to know

56:38.880 --> 56:43.120
 you know this maybe you can philosophize about how hard is it to learn

56:43.120 --> 56:46.480
 okay let's assume a learning we want to learn it okay want to learn so what do

56:46.480 --> 56:50.720
 we do we put a learning machine that watches execution

56:50.720 --> 56:55.360
 trials in many countries and many

56:55.360 --> 56:59.680
 locations okay all the machine can learn is to see

56:59.680 --> 57:05.920
 shot or not shot dead not dead a court issued an order or didn't okay just the

57:05.920 --> 57:09.200
 facts from the fact you don't know who listens to

57:09.200 --> 57:13.600
 home you don't know that the condemned person

57:13.600 --> 57:17.680
 listen to the bullets that the bullets are listening to the

57:17.680 --> 57:25.200
 captain okay all we hear is one command two shots dead okay a

57:25.200 --> 57:30.720
 triple of variable yes no yes no okay when that you can learn who

57:30.720 --> 57:33.840
 listens to whom and you can answer the question no

57:33.840 --> 57:39.760
 definitively no but don't you think you can start proposing ideas for humans to

57:39.760 --> 57:44.240
 review you want machine to learn right you want a robot

57:44.240 --> 57:50.640
 so robot is watching trials like that 200 trials

57:50.640 --> 57:55.200
 and then he has to answer the question what if rifleman a

57:55.200 --> 58:01.440
 refrain from shooting yeah so how to do that

58:01.440 --> 58:06.080
 that's exactly my point at looking at the facts don't give you the strings

58:06.080 --> 58:11.760
 behind the facts absolutely but do you think of machine learning

58:11.760 --> 58:17.040
 as it's currently defined as only something that looks at the facts

58:17.040 --> 58:20.240
 and tries right now they only look at the facts yeah so is there a way to

58:20.240 --> 58:25.040
 modify yeah in your sense playful manipulation

58:25.040 --> 58:28.960
 playful manipulation yes doing the interventionist kind of things

58:28.960 --> 58:32.160
 intervention but it could be at random for instance the

58:32.160 --> 58:37.920
 rifleman is sick that day or he just vomits or whatever so

58:37.920 --> 58:41.920
 machine can observe this unexpected event which

58:41.920 --> 58:45.840
 introduced noise the noise still have to be

58:45.840 --> 58:51.600
 random to be able to and related to randomized experiment

58:51.600 --> 58:58.080
 and then you have a observational studies from which to infer the strings

58:58.080 --> 59:02.880
 behind the facts it's doable to a certain extent

59:02.880 --> 59:06.160
 but now that we expert in what you can do

59:06.160 --> 59:11.200
 once you have a model we can reason back and say what you kind of data you need

59:11.200 --> 59:17.200
 to build a model got it so i know you're not a futurist

59:17.200 --> 59:22.480
 but are you excited have you when you look back at your life

59:22.480 --> 59:26.640
 long for the idea of creating a human level intelligence system yeah

59:26.640 --> 59:32.480
 i'm driven by that all my life i'm driven just by one thing

59:32.480 --> 59:39.200
 but i go slowly i go from what i know to the next step incrementally

59:39.200 --> 59:43.920
 so without imagining what the end goal looks like do you imagine

59:43.920 --> 59:47.680
 what the end goal is going to be a machine

59:47.680 --> 59:52.720
 that can answer sophisticated questions counterfactuals of regret

59:52.720 --> 59:59.280
 compassion responsibility and free will

59:59.280 --> 1:00:03.680
 so what is a good test is a touring test

1:00:03.680 --> 1:00:07.200
 a reasonable test free will doesn't exist yet

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:12.000
 there's no how would you test free will and that's so far we know only one

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:18.720
 thing many if robots can communicate

1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:22.560
 with reward and punishment among themselves

1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:27.280
 and hitting each other on the wrist and say you shouldn't have done that

1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:33.840
 okay um playing better soccer because they can do that

1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:37.600
 what do you mean because they can do that because they can communicate among

1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:40.000
 themselves because of the communication they can do

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:44.000
 because they communicate like us reward and punishment

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.520
 yes you didn't pass the ball the right the right time

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:51.440
 and so for therefore you're going to sit on the bench for the next two

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:55.440
 if they start communicating like that the question is will they play better

1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:59.600
 soccer as opposed to what as opposed to what they do now

1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:04.880
 without this ability to reason about reward and punishment

1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:11.600
 responsibility and I can only think about communication

1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:15.680
 communication is and in not necessarily natural language but just

1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:19.760
 communication just communication and that's important to have a quick

1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:24.000
 and effective means of communicating knowledge

1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:27.120
 if the coach tells you you should have passed the ball pink

1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:30.480
 he conveys so much knowledge to you as opposed to what

1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:35.200
 go down and change your software that's the alternative

1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:39.440
 but the coach doesn't know your software so how can his coach tell you

1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:44.320
 you should have passed the ball but that our language is very effective you

1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:46.960
 should have passed the ball you know your software

1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:52.160
 you tweak the right module okay and next time you don't do it

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:55.200
 now that's for playing soccer or the rules are well defined

1:01:55.200 --> 1:01:59.360
 no they're not well defined when you should pass the ball is not well

1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:04.400
 defined no it's a it's very soft very noisy

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:07.920
 yes you have to do it under pressure it's art

1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:15.280
 but in terms of aligning values between computers and humans

1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:21.520
 do you think this cause and effect type of thinking is important to align the

1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:25.120
 values values morals ethics under which the

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:29.200
 machines make decisions is is the cause effect where

1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:34.640
 the two can come together cause effect is necessary component

1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:40.320
 to build a ethical machine because the machine has to empathize

1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:44.320
 to understand what's good for you to build a model of your

1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:50.880
 of you as a recipient which should be very much what what is compassion

1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:56.960
 they imagine that you suffer pain as much as me as much as me

1:02:56.960 --> 1:03:01.840
 i do have already a model of myself right so it's very easy for me to map

1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:04.480
 you to mine i don't have to rebuild the model

1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:09.440
 it's much easier to say oh you're like me okay therefore i would not hate you

1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:14.560
 and the machine has to imagine it has to try to fake to be human essentially so

1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:18.640
 you can imagine that you're that you're like me

1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:24.080
 right and well who is me that's the fact that that's consciousness

1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:29.200
 they have a model of yourself where do you get this model you look at yourself

1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:33.840
 as if you are a part of the environment if you build a model of yourself

1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:38.080
 versus the environment then you can say i need to have a model of myself

1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:41.760
 i have abilities i have desires and so forth okay

1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:47.120
 i have a blueprint of myself well not the full detail because i cannot

1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:50.560
 get the halting problem but i have a blueprint

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:54.080
 so on that level of a blueprint i can modify things

1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:58.320
 i can look at myself in the mirror and say if i change this more tweak this

1:03:58.320 --> 1:04:02.240
 model i'm going to perform differently

1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:08.160
 that is what we mean by free will and consciousness

1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:12.240
 what do you think is consciousness uh is it simply self awareness so

1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:16.560
 including yourself into the model of the world that's right that

1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:20.160
 some people tell me no this is only part of consciousness and then they start

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:23.280
 telling me what they really mean by consciousness and i lose them

1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:31.520
 yeah for me consciousness is having a blueprint of your software

1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:38.400
 do you have concerns about the future of ai all the different trajectories of

1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:42.400
 all of our research yes um where's your hope where the

1:04:42.400 --> 1:04:45.680
 movement has where your concerns i'm concerned

1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:49.360
 because i know we are building a new species

1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:56.640
 that has the capability of exceeding our exceeding us

1:04:56.640 --> 1:05:01.200
 exceeding our capabilities and can breathe itself

1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:05.280
 and take over the world absolutely it's a new

1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:10.000
 species that is uncontrolled we don't know the degree to which we control it

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:14.320
 we don't even understand what it means to be able to control this new

1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:20.560
 species so i'm concerned i don't have anything to add

1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:26.000
 to that because it's such a gray area that's unknown

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:33.200
 it never happened in history yeah the only the only time it happened in

1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:37.520
 history was evolution with human being

1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:42.720
 it wasn't very successful was it some people says it was a great success

1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:46.240
 for us it was but a few people along the way

1:05:46.240 --> 1:05:49.280
 our few creatures along the way would not agree

1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:54.880
 so uh so it's just because it's such a gray area there's nothing else to say

1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:59.840
 we have a sample of one sample of one it's us

1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:07.840
 but some people would look at you and say yeah but we were looking to you

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:13.760
 to help us make sure that sample two works out okay actually we have more than

1:06:13.760 --> 1:06:17.120
 a sample of more we have theories theories

1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:20.640
 and that's good we don't need to be statisticians

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:26.400
 so sample of one doesn't mean any poverty of knowledge it's not

1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:30.400
 sample of one plus theory conjectural theory

1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:34.240
 of what could happen yeah that we do have

1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:39.680
 but i i really feel helpless in contributing to this argument

1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:46.560
 because i know so little and and my imagination is limited

1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:55.440
 and i know how much i don't know and i but i'm concerned

1:06:55.440 --> 1:07:00.880
 you're born and raised in israel born raised in israel yes and uh later

1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:07.920
 served in um israel military defense forces in the in the israel defense force

1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:16.400
 yeah what did you learn from that experience for this experience

1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:23.520
 there's a kibbutz in there as well yes because i was in a nachal which is a

1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:28.400
 combination of agricultural work and military service

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:32.480
 we were supposed i was really idealist i wanted to

1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:36.080
 be a member of the kibbutz throughout my life

1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:46.000
 and to live a communal life and uh so i prepared myself for that

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:54.960
 slowly slowly i want the greater challenge so that's a far world away

1:07:54.960 --> 1:08:01.280
 both but i learned from that what i can it was a miracle

1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:06.880
 it was a miracle that i served in the 1950s

1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:15.280
 i i don't know how we survived the country was under austerity

1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:22.000
 it tripled its population from 600 000 to a million point eight when i finished

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:29.360
 college no one who went hungry austerity yes

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:33.200
 when you wanted to buy uh to make an omelette

1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:38.080
 in a restaurant you had to bring your own egg

1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:44.720
 and the the imprisoned people from bringing food from the

1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:52.320
 from farming from the villages to the city but no one went hungry and i

1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:55.680
 always add to it and

1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:00.160
 higher education did not suffer any budget cuts

1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:06.320
 they still invested in me in my wife in our generation to get the best

1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:12.240
 education that they could okay so i'm really

1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:18.480
 grateful for the opportunity and i'm trying to pay back now okay

1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:22.720
 it's a miracle that we survived the war of 1948

1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:30.000
 they were so close to a second genocide it was all in plant

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:34.560
 but we survived it by miracle and then the second miracle that not many people

1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:40.160
 talk about the next phase how no one went hungry

1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:43.840
 and the country managed to triple its population

1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:50.160
 you know it means to imagine united states going from what 350 million

1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:54.960
 to yeah and believe this is a really

1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:59.040
 tense part of the world it's a complicated part of the world

1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:07.760
 israel and all around yes so religion is is um at the core of that complexity

1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:13.600
 or one of the components religion is a strong motivating course to many many

1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:17.440
 people in the middle east yes in your view

1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:23.040
 looking back is religion good for society

1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:26.480
 that's a good question for robotic you know

1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:32.160
 there's echoes of that question equip robot with religious belief

1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:36.480
 suppose we we find out or we agree that religion is good to you to keep you in

1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:40.960
 in line okay should we give the robot the

1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:45.920
 metaphor of a god as a matter of fact the robot will get it without us

1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:50.960
 also why but the robot will reason by metaphor

1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:58.960
 and what is the most primitive metaphor a child grows with

1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:06.320
 mother smile father teaching father image and mother image that's god

1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:10.560
 so you want it or not the robot will

1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:14.640
 well assuming assuming that the robot is going to have a mother and a father

1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:18.640
 it may only have a programmer which doesn't supply warmth

1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:25.280
 and discipline discipline it does so the robot will have this a model of the

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:31.360
 trainer and everything that happens in the world cosmology and so is going to

1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:38.160
 be mapped into the programmer that's god man

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:41.680
 the the thing that represents the origin of

1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:46.160
 everything for that robot the most primitive relationship

1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:51.200
 so it's going to arrive there by metaphor and so the the question is if

1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:57.840
 overall that metaphor has served us well as humans I really don't know

1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:05.120
 I think it did but as long as you keep in mind it's only a metaphor

1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:11.600
 so if you think we can can we talk about your son

1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:17.600
 yes yes can you tell his story a story well Daniel

1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:29.520
 story is known is was abducted in Pakistan by al Qaeda driven sect and

1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:35.040
 under various pretenses I don't even pay attention to what the pretence will

1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:42.720
 originally they wanted to have to have in the United States

1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:49.440
 deliver some promised airplanes there it was all made up and all this

1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:55.920
 demands were bogus I don't know really but

1:12:55.920 --> 1:13:03.600
 eventually he was executed in front of a camera

1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:07.280
 at the core of that is hate and intolerance

1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:13.920
 at the core yes absolutely yes we don't really appreciate

1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:18.800
 the depth of the hate at which

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:26.000
 which billions of peoples are educated

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.400
 we don't understand it I just listened recently

1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:38.720
 to what they teach you in Mogadishu

1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:45.520
 when when the water stopped in the tap

1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:52.320
 we knew exactly who did it the Jews the Jews we didn't know how

1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:57.920
 but we knew who did it we don't appreciate what it means to us

1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:02.240
 the depth is unbelievable do you think

1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:06.240
 all of us are capable of evil

1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:12.320
 and the education the indoctrination is really what we are capable of evil if

1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:18.640
 you're indoctrinated sufficiently long and in depth

1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:24.800
 we are capable of ISIS we are capable of Nazism

1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:30.080
 yes we are but the question is whether we after we have

1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:34.320
 gone through some Western education and we learned that everything is really

1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:37.520
 relative it is no absolute God

1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:41.680
 it's only a belief in God whether we are capable now

1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:45.680
 of being transformed under certain circumstances

1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:52.880
 to become brutal yeah that is a I'm worried about it

1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:57.360
 because some people say yes given the right circumstances

1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:04.320
 given economical bad economical crisis okay you are

1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:08.320
 capable of doing it too and that's worries me I

1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:14.560
 I want to believe it I'm not capable this seven years after Daniel's death he

1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:17.760
 wrote an article at the Wall Street Journal titled Daniel

1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:22.960
 Parle on the normalization of evil yes what was your message a message back then

1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:27.440
 and how did it change today over over the years

1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:34.320
 I I lost what was the message the message was that

1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:44.480
 we are not treating terrorism as a taboo we are treating it as a bargaining

1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:49.440
 device that is accepted people have grievance

1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:56.320
 and they go and and bomb restaurants okay it's normal look you're even not

1:15:56.320 --> 1:16:01.760
 not surprised when I tell you that 20 years ago you said what for

1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:04.880
 grievance you go and blow a restaurant

1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:10.960
 today it's becoming normalized the banalization of evil

1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:17.920
 and we have created that to ourselves by normalizing by

1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:22.640
 by making it part of

1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:30.160
 political life it's a political debate every

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:35.760
 terrorist yesterday becomes a freedom fighter today and tomorrow it's becoming

1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:41.360
 terrorist again it's switchable all right and so we should call out evil when

1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:46.720
 there's evil if we don't want to be part of it

1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:51.280
 becoming if you want yeah if we want to separate

1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:55.280
 good from evil that's one of the first thing that

1:16:55.280 --> 1:17:00.400
 what would they in the garden of Eden remember the first thing

1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:08.560
 that god tell them was hey you want some knowledge here's a tree of good and evil

1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:12.160
 so this evil touched your life personally

1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:18.880
 does your heart have anger sadness or is it hope

1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:24.240
 okay I see some beautiful people coming from

1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:30.640
 Pakistan I see beautiful people everywhere but I see

1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:38.560
 horrible propagation of evil in this country too

1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:45.760
 it shows you how populistic slogans can catch the mind of the best

1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:54.160
 intellectuals today's father's day I didn't know that yeah what's uh what's

1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:58.160
 what's uh fond memory you have of Daniel

1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:05.920
 or many good memories uh immense he was my mentor

1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:09.120
 he had

1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:13.280
 sense of balance that I didn't have

1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:19.280
 yeah he saw the beauty in every person

1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:23.680
 he was not as emotional as I am more

1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:30.080
 looking things in perspective he really liked every person he really

1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:38.800
 grew up with the idea that a foreigner is a reason for curiosity

1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:45.200
 not for fear it's one time we went in Berkeley

1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:49.040
 and homeless came out from some dark alley

1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:52.240
 and said hey man can you spare a dime I retreated

1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:57.440
 back you know two feet back and then I just hugged him and say here's a dime

1:18:57.440 --> 1:19:01.200
 enjoy yourself maybe you want some

1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:06.480
 money to take a bath or whatever where did he get it

1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:12.800
 not for me do you have advice for young minds today dreaming

1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:16.480
 about creating as you have dreamt creating

1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:20.800
 intelligent systems what is the best way to arrive at new breakthrough

1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:25.200
 ideas and carry them through the fire of criticism and

1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:31.680
 and past conventional ideas ask your questions

1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:37.600
 really your questions are never dumb

1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:44.640
 and solve them your own way okay and don't take no for an answer

1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:48.320
 look if they are really dumb you will find out quickly

1:19:48.320 --> 1:19:52.400
 by trying an arrow to see that they're not leading any place

1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:59.360
 but follow them and try to understand things your way

1:19:59.360 --> 1:20:03.920
 that is my advice I don't know if it's going to help anyone

1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:09.840
 now there's brilliantly there is a lot of

1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:18.480
 it's the inertia in science in academia it is slowing down science

1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:23.280
 yeah those two words your way that's a powerful thing

1:20:23.280 --> 1:20:28.560
 it's against inertia potentially against the flow against your professor

1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:32.720
 against your professor I wrote the book of why

1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:38.560
 in order to democratize common sense

1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:46.480
 in order to instill rebellious spirit in students so they wouldn't wait for

1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:51.680
 until the professor gets things right

1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:58.000
 as you wrote the manifesto of the rebellion against the professor

1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:02.880
 against the professor yes so looking back at your life of research

1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:06.160
 what ideas do you hope ripple through the next many decades

1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:10.400
 what what do you hope your legacy will be

1:21:10.400 --> 1:21:15.280
 I already have a tombstone

1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:23.680
 carved oh boy and the fundamental law of

1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:30.720
 counterfactuals that's what it's a it's a simple equation

1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:35.520
 what a counterfactual in terms of a model surgery

1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:39.360
 that's it because everything follows from that

1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:46.480
 if you get that all the rest I can die in peace

1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:49.600
 and my student can derive all my knowledge

1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:54.080
 my mother mother means the rest follows yeah

1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:57.760
 yeah thank you so much for talking today I really appreciate it thank you for

1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:03.760
