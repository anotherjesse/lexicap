WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
 I get so passionate about it. I get so angry, you know, because there's a saying like,

00:05.040 --> 00:12.320
 oh, can you beat him in a hook? Can you be a man? Win. Win. That's it. Just win and don't talk to

00:12.320 --> 00:18.400
 me about anything else. You believe the match is finished and I wonder if that gets in the head

00:18.400 --> 00:29.280
 of the other person. You see this? Yeah. Quit. The following is a conversation with Devon Larritt.

00:29.280 --> 00:36.160
 Considered by many to be one of the greatest arm wrestlers in history. This is Alex Friedman

00:36.160 --> 00:41.680
 podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

00:42.320 --> 00:49.920
 here's Devon Larritt. You are considered to be one of the greatest arm wrestlers in history,

00:49.920 --> 00:55.360
 plus are one of the most charismatic and fun people to watch in arm wrestling. But let me

00:55.360 --> 01:01.680
 first start with a ridiculous, the controversial opinion. I actually really enjoy Over the Top,

01:01.680 --> 01:08.880
 the movie with Sylvester Stallone, where he's a trucker. It's like a father son movie. It's,

01:08.880 --> 01:15.120
 you know, like a bunch of sports have the definitive movie. The boxing has Rocky, maybe

01:15.120 --> 01:21.280
 folk style, collegiate wrestling, has a vision quest. What else is there? Billiards has color

01:21.280 --> 01:28.560
 of money. This is the sort of movie for arm wrestling. So what did Over the Top get right?

01:28.560 --> 01:34.240
 What did it get wrong about arm wrestling? That was actually based off of a real story. A lot of

01:34.240 --> 01:41.040
 people don't know that. Now, the Over the Top movie, I mean, to a certain degree, that's actually

01:41.040 --> 01:46.240
 real life. Like that tournament Over the Top was real. It was literally named Over the Top. Yes.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.480
 Yes. There was a trucker division, and the guy actually won a truck for real. His name is John

01:50.480 --> 01:54.640
 Bersink. You know who that is, right? So the actual Over the Top tournament, the trucker division

01:54.640 --> 02:01.440
 was won by John. Who is John Bersink? He is, a lot of people talk about him as like a legend and

02:01.440 --> 02:09.920
 one of, if not the greatest arm wrestlers of all time. John Bersink is every arm wrestler's

02:10.640 --> 02:17.760
 father to a certain degree, all of us. The entire sport looks up to him. He,

02:17.760 --> 02:27.600
 it's incredible what he's done. I mean, at 18, he won Over the Top at 57. He just competed with

02:27.600 --> 02:34.800
 me a couple months ago, still at the world level. 18, that's 40 years of being at the top of the

02:34.800 --> 02:40.160
 sport. It's incredible. He's hailed as the greatest of all time in the sport arm wrestling.

02:40.960 --> 02:47.200
 Yeah. And he doesn't, he's beaten some monsters. Oh yeah. Yeah. And he doesn't, I mean,

02:47.200 --> 02:57.040
 when you talk about like the evolution of the sport, he's responsible for so much of it. Like

02:57.040 --> 03:03.200
 when you talk about like, a lot of times when you go back like 20 years, 30 years,

03:03.200 --> 03:08.560
 a lot of us looked at arm wrestling, I think it's, I mean, as something you could kind of do.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.720
 And he's the first guy who's like, if you want to get better at arm wrestling, you got arm wrestling.

03:12.720 --> 03:20.720
 And it seems so simple, but you know, he answered so many questions that all of us had about

03:20.720 --> 03:28.960
 techniques in the sport back, you know, pre, pre video internet. Yeah, he's everybody,

03:28.960 --> 03:33.280
 he's been everybody's target for like 40 years. So in terms of strength, there's a power in terms

03:33.280 --> 03:37.600
 of skill. What did he teach the sport of arm wrestling? So if you look, how did the sport

03:37.600 --> 03:44.000
 change from 80s, 90s to the aughts? You were at the top of the world for many years, you know,

03:45.680 --> 03:49.360
 many argue you're still at the very top of the world, but like you were very dominant,

03:49.360 --> 03:55.840
 both left and right hand. And I don't know, 2008 to 2013, something like that.

03:57.280 --> 04:03.760
 So how did that sport evolve to today? So it's hard for me to comment, you know,

04:03.760 --> 04:09.680
 prior to, you know, when I came to the sport was kind of mid 90s, like I've been arm wrestling my

04:09.680 --> 04:16.480
 whole life, but I wasn't really involved in the sport to a major degree until probably, you know,

04:16.480 --> 04:24.880
 mid 90s. But I'll say that before the mid 90s, it was really hard to get good at arm wrestling.

04:25.440 --> 04:32.800
 Very difficult. Everybody was doing it wrong, really. Like it was really rare to find people

04:32.800 --> 04:39.120
 who were technically good arm wrestlers. It was very underground, you know, when I when I got into

04:39.120 --> 04:44.000
 sport, it was a flyer that came in the mail. You had to know somebody who knew somebody who knew

04:44.000 --> 04:51.120
 somebody. And then you go to a club and you can't do anything with these people. And and they'll

04:51.120 --> 04:58.480
 and they knew how to arm wrestle, they did. But real masters were rare. And, you know, then

04:58.480 --> 05:05.680
 internet, internet helped everybody. Communication, the transfer of knowledge became so much faster.

05:06.560 --> 05:15.360
 People became technically, you know, invested. People started train sharing sharing ideas by I'd

05:15.360 --> 05:24.800
 say 2000. Well, probably around the turn of the millennia, I'd say that professional leagues

05:24.800 --> 05:32.640
 started to slowly pick up more organized, bigger productions started to track more athletes.

05:33.600 --> 05:41.680
 More people took it seriously. By 2010, I'd say there was another jump. More serious leagues,

05:41.680 --> 05:49.440
 a little bit more money. By 2015, more major media, like people were investing a lot of money,

05:49.440 --> 05:55.200
 like, you know, millionaires, billionaires type of people were organizing events, setting up leagues.

05:56.400 --> 06:03.440
 And yeah, I mean, the past five years, it's just blown up the techniques. I mean, if, if I was to

06:03.440 --> 06:10.640
 go back to when I started, you know, what, what took me 10 or 15 years to learn? I mean, new

06:10.640 --> 06:17.040
 guys are showing up and they've got it down in like a year. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the thing about it,

06:17.040 --> 06:24.960
 the development of the sport is it's like I was telling you off, Mike, it's a battle of one

06:26.080 --> 06:31.520
 versus one. Yeah. And then that can turn into battle of nations, which, you know, there is,

06:32.080 --> 06:40.080
 there's Canada, there's the United States, there's all the Eastern Europe, Russia, Georgia, all of

06:40.080 --> 06:46.000
 that. That, that's what makes some of the greatest sports in Olympics grade, like weightlifting.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.720
 It's a battle of nations, not just the battle of individuals. And it's almost like these two humans

06:50.720 --> 06:55.440
 represent the two nations. And I see that very much. We'll talk about your matches coming up, but

06:55.440 --> 07:02.720
 there is that battle between North America and that other part of the world. Yeah. Yeah. North

07:02.720 --> 07:09.040
 America is very prized. You know, the North American champion is always highly sought after

07:09.040 --> 07:15.920
 because they're typically the most famous. You know, even still when, you know, quite arguably,

07:15.920 --> 07:22.400
 there's always somebody in Eastern Europe who's just monstrous. It's typically the North American

07:22.400 --> 07:28.480
 athlete who's more recognized. By the way, oh yeah, we'll have a cup here with some maple syrup. Cheers,

07:28.480 --> 07:35.840
 Lex. Cheers. We should probably show, you just down that whole thing. No, no, no, I'm going to sip

07:35.840 --> 07:42.320
 it. I'm going to sip it, you know, but by all means, it's really good, right? That is delicious.

07:42.320 --> 07:51.360
 Yeah. That is maple syrup. Yeah. That's a perfect July day from Canada in a bottle. Yeah.

07:52.160 --> 07:59.440
 So you're on a, on a totally, on a total tangent. You are known for appreciating food in all kinds

07:59.440 --> 08:05.040
 of ways, but one of the things you're known for is pancakes. That is, yeah, that's gone

08:05.040 --> 08:12.640
 to a crazy place in the sport, but yeah. Where did that originate? So where that originated?

08:12.640 --> 08:19.600
 When it went from like your actual love for pancakes to the meme. Yeah. So I think what happened was

08:22.080 --> 08:31.280
 so I had a match with Michael Todd, big match. Michael, great champion. He's another guy who's,

08:31.280 --> 08:37.920
 you know, he's never going to get off the horse. You know, he's, he's, his elbow is a complete

08:37.920 --> 08:43.760
 disaster. Probably one of the most loved and hated guys in the sport right now.

08:45.040 --> 08:51.360
 Is it because of the Kings move? The Kings move brings him a lot of hate. Not from me,

08:51.360 --> 08:56.800
 not from a lot of people, but a lot of observers have a big problem with the Kings move.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.320
 What's wrong with being a little bit controversial? That's fun.

09:00.320 --> 09:06.320
 You know, I get so passionate about it. I get so angry, you know, because there's the saying

09:06.320 --> 09:12.000
 like, Oh, can you beat him in a hook? Can you be, man, win. Yeah. Win. That's all that matters.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.520
 Just win and don't talk to me about anything else. If you can win with style, win with style,

09:18.240 --> 09:22.960
 but don't talk to me about anything but winning other. That's the priority.

09:22.960 --> 09:27.920
 So you had this match with Michael Todd. Yeah. So I was in a terrible place.

09:27.920 --> 09:33.200
 Um, I guess it was, I get so screwed up with the years. It's 2022 now, right?

09:33.200 --> 09:35.600
 No, it's 2030. What are you talking about? Yeah.

09:35.600 --> 09:39.600
 That's right. I think it is actually 2030. We're way ahead of schedule.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.960
 Yeah. Oh man.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.520
 That's right. So when was this? This was like a decade ago or no?

09:43.520 --> 09:46.400
 No, this is like a year and a bit ago.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.160
 Oh, this is very recent.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.920
 Very recent. Yeah. So I got really sick.

09:51.920 --> 09:52.480
 Is that the match?

09:52.480 --> 09:54.000
 Yeah. This is the match, right?

09:54.000 --> 09:54.720
 Okay.

09:54.720 --> 09:59.040
 Awesome match. So this is, this match is for the legacy hammer.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.360
 So we invented this thing called the legacy hammer and Michael took it from me.

10:03.360 --> 10:11.520
 And I think 2018 and then COVID shut everything down and Michael went overseas to try and set up

10:11.520 --> 10:14.320
 because at that time Michael was a North American champion.

10:15.040 --> 10:20.720
 He beat me and he went to Dubai and he organized this great big match with LaVon

10:20.720 --> 10:25.680
 and the whole thing fell apart. Organizers, leagues wouldn't let it happen,

10:25.680 --> 10:30.320
 but there was still an ability to have a match of significance happen.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.520
 So Michael's like, who do you want? And I'm like, let's give Devon a rematch.

10:33.520 --> 10:37.760
 And I'm like, yeah. Yes. And I was really sick at the time.

10:38.720 --> 10:46.400
 I had DVT. I had pulmonary embolism. I was mentally in a terrible place and I got offered

10:46.400 --> 10:54.960
 the match and I just totally turned my life around and I committed really hard.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.800
 Yeah. And what happened in this match, by the way?

10:59.760 --> 11:04.560
 Oh, I just totally destroyed them. Yeah. I just beat the piss out of them.

11:05.680 --> 11:10.160
 Yeah. Michael's a good friend of mine, but

11:10.880 --> 11:13.760
 Yeah. There's a lot of camaraderie and you guys talked afterwards.

11:13.760 --> 11:19.040
 Yeah. But we fight like brothers, you know, like, so we let each other really fight hard

11:19.040 --> 11:25.280
 against each other. But so I was, I knew, I mean, strength and mass, they go hand in hand.

11:26.320 --> 11:31.920
 And I committed to just getting as big and as strong as I could and literally I was

11:31.920 --> 11:38.560
 eating pancakes every day. Bacon, pancakes, every sloppy bit of garbage food I could eat.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.840
 I was trying to eat healthy also, but if there was garbage food, I'd eat it.

11:41.840 --> 11:45.120
 What do you mean, bacon and pancakes isn't healthy? What are you talking about?

11:45.120 --> 11:51.120
 Exactly. If people should go watch, there's a video where you make like the Canadian

11:51.760 --> 11:57.120
 meal of bacon with some bacon cooking tips, water, that was interesting.

11:57.120 --> 12:02.080
 Yeah. And then obviously pancakes and maple syrup all over the whole thing.

12:02.080 --> 12:08.320
 Yeah. You're making me very hungry. I've caused more diabetes than, you know,

12:08.320 --> 12:12.560
 probably going to get in trouble karmically for making the world obese.

12:12.560 --> 12:16.560
 You should probably write a, like, like a book, The Pancake Diet, Devin Larritz.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.640
 Yeah. I think I will do that one day.

12:18.640 --> 12:24.240
 So you said mass and strength go hand in hand, just at a big level about arm wrestling.

12:24.240 --> 12:31.680
 What's more important, strength, power, endurance, skill, strategy, or mental toughness?

12:31.680 --> 12:36.880
 Like, how do these components all come into play in arm wrestling?

12:36.880 --> 12:42.480
 They're all important. You can use everything and you can adjust your strategy based off of

12:42.480 --> 12:48.960
 the tools that you have. I would say if I could pick ever, just one thing to have more of,

12:50.960 --> 12:55.520
 I would say that it would be strength gained while fighting.

12:56.240 --> 13:02.080
 While actually arm wrestling, so not off the, no, no, no. So you get stronger from arm wrestling.

13:02.080 --> 13:07.840
 How do you get stronger from arm wrestling? Injujitsu and grappling, you can get good by training

13:07.840 --> 13:12.800
 with people much technically worse than you. So with white belts and blue belts,

13:12.800 --> 13:14.320
 it's actually beneficial. Agree.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.920
 Because you get to work stuff out. Right.

13:16.720 --> 13:24.960
 But I wouldn't say it develops like that intensity and power required to go against

13:26.080 --> 13:31.520
 people at your level. So how do you balance that? Is it okay to go against people that are

13:31.520 --> 13:37.040
 much weaker than you? Or do you really have to go against people at the same level?

13:37.920 --> 13:48.080
 I think that a blended strategy is probably the best. I'd say kind of a rule is whatever

13:48.080 --> 13:54.720
 you do, you get better at. So you want to be kind of as precise as possible. You don't want to get

13:54.720 --> 14:02.560
 hurt. And it's just about investment. And the answer is not always the same. Things are going

14:02.560 --> 14:12.960
 to change. I am currently a big believer in what I call tower building. So you have to do a lot of

14:12.960 --> 14:20.880
 volume to build a great tower. You need to have a ton, a ton of volume. So when you look at how

14:20.880 --> 14:27.760
 to best build volume, you want to do workouts that aren't particularly challenging, that make you

14:27.760 --> 14:36.240
 feel good and do them so that when you add them all together, you get the biggest number. So many

14:36.800 --> 14:45.360
 easy workouts a day that are specific as possible, in my opinion, is the best way to lay the foundation

14:45.360 --> 14:53.440
 for an extreme peak. And precision, right? Like there's no more precise way to get strong

14:53.440 --> 15:01.520
 at arm wrestling than arm wrestle. So how often can you arm wrestle? What's your training

15:01.520 --> 15:09.200
 measurement? You've talked about this as the climb, right? What is the training process

15:09.200 --> 15:16.080
 to get great at arm wrestling? Well, again, it's going to depend on what level you're at.

15:17.600 --> 15:24.560
 The answer at the beginning might not be the same. For me, the guy who's been doing it almost 30

15:24.560 --> 15:32.800
 years, I have to harvest. I have to harvest energy from clubs. I call it cosmic punch. Sorry to

15:32.800 --> 15:37.840
 interrupt you here in Austin, Texas. You are in Austin, Texas, but you were at the, what was it

15:37.840 --> 15:43.680
 called? The water tank. You had an awesome crowd. It was great. I got to watch that. I got to interact

15:43.680 --> 15:50.720
 with a lot of those guys. Just an amazing community, amazing human beings. I got to talk to Dimitri

15:50.720 --> 15:57.200
 in Russian and in English. He's an engineer. His wife is an engineer. So he's a brilliant dude, but

15:57.200 --> 16:03.680
 also one of the toughest guys you face there. But you faced, I don't know how many people,

16:03.680 --> 16:08.800
 there must have been hundreds of matches. Yeah. So the bar was full. Yeah. And that for me is a

16:08.800 --> 16:14.720
 perfect training scenario. Yeah. So if I go in and just kind of be, I'm like a lightning rod,

16:15.360 --> 16:21.280
 and I just absorb everything that I can get from people, all their effort,

16:23.360 --> 16:28.400
 that's perfect. That's perfect. But I'm lucky because I'm in a place that I can handle it.

16:28.400 --> 16:36.880
 You know, if I was losing or failing, this would not be optimal. But because I'm strong enough,

16:36.880 --> 16:40.640
 I've been doing it long enough that I can kind of absorb it without damaging me.

16:41.280 --> 16:46.880
 This is perfect. This is perfect. I typically, when I'm training up for a very serious match,

16:47.760 --> 16:53.600
 I'll try and do that three or four times a week. And then the days in between,

16:53.600 --> 17:02.080
 I will just do blood flow rehab, blood flow rehab. I will never hit a PR, a record. I'll never do it

17:02.080 --> 17:06.720
 anymore. I don't do it. I used to, a lot of things change. And that's why I say like,

17:06.720 --> 17:11.760
 there's a lot of ways to do it. This is currently a system that's working very well for me.

17:12.400 --> 17:18.240
 So when you say PR, you're not aggressively chasing a peak. You're just building and building and

17:18.240 --> 17:26.000
 building. Yeah. My only peak that I care about is for this cycle, the 25th of June. That's my only

17:26.000 --> 17:35.360
 PR. Let's talk about the 25th of June. Oh, yeah. Let's talk about LeVon Signeshvili,

17:36.240 --> 17:44.400
 the Georgian Hulk. Yeah. Question number one, is it possible to beat him? He is widely acknowledged

17:44.400 --> 17:55.360
 as the most powerful person in arm wrestling today. Is he beatable? And so how? Everybody's

17:55.360 --> 18:05.600
 beatable. Everybody's beatable. LeVon is incredible. He is what this modern peak of arm wrestling

18:05.600 --> 18:12.640
 represents. So for people who are just listening, we also have an overlay of a video of LeVon going

18:12.640 --> 18:21.520
 against Vitaly Letin, another top three person in the world, perhaps in arm wrestling. And LeVon

18:21.520 --> 18:28.960
 is the guy in the right, just big. I love it. And the aggression, I mean, actually sort of

18:28.960 --> 18:36.400
 underneath it all is, it seems to be a teddy bear, but when he turns it on, it's raw power.

18:36.400 --> 18:43.200
 He's the full package. LeVon is, he represents the pinnacle. There's Dennis in the background.

18:43.840 --> 18:50.000
 He's like, I want to be back in there. LeVon has a lot of bases covered. He's,

18:50.800 --> 18:57.840
 I mean, he's curling 300 pounds with one arm. I mean, the strength that he shows for arm wrestling

18:57.840 --> 19:10.240
 is, is, is so far ahead of the field is very, very strong. But it's absolutely possible.

19:10.240 --> 19:15.040
 It's absolutely possible. The one thing that I'm confident about, well, I'd say there's two things.

19:15.920 --> 19:23.120
 The two things I'm confident about is that I have more experience than he does. And experience

19:23.120 --> 19:34.640
 counts for a lot. The other thing is my ability to breathe and recover. So if ever there's an

19:34.640 --> 19:41.280
 opportunity for the tide to turn, that's, I think, where you'll never get it back. So I think if I

19:41.280 --> 19:49.520
 can somehow find a hole in his game, then yeah, see here, you want to hold off the initial like

19:49.520 --> 19:56.560
 assault of power and that, and then wear them out and to find the hole. And then

19:58.400 --> 20:02.400
 how much of that is mental? How much of is just the physical ability to do

20:03.280 --> 20:05.840
 for your muscles to have the endurance to hold off?

20:07.920 --> 20:15.760
 I like to make the sport bigger. And a lot of things that most arm wrestlers

20:15.760 --> 20:25.040
 believe the sport is, I always try and push those boundaries. So there is definitely a mental

20:25.040 --> 20:31.440
 aspect to it when you're faced with something that you've never seen before. That's when things

20:31.440 --> 20:39.520
 like experience comes in, he can become surprised where what's a surprise for him is routine for

20:39.520 --> 20:48.320
 me. So my adjustments will be more precise, more accurate. That's how I get in. That's how I get

20:48.320 --> 20:55.520
 in. Yeah, I play a dirty game. So some of it, how important is confidence in the whole,

20:56.720 --> 21:03.920
 in the progression of the match? Is there ups and downs of confidence? Like holy

21:03.920 --> 21:08.240
 shit, I actually have a chance to win this. Holy shit, I'm winning this, you're done.

21:08.240 --> 21:12.480
 There's some of my favorite moments, I don't know if those are fake or not in terms of your

21:12.480 --> 21:17.520
 expressions, if it's fake until you make it. But whenever you shake your head or whatever,

21:18.240 --> 21:25.280
 you make it apparent that you believe the match is finished. And I wonder if that gets in the

21:25.280 --> 21:32.240
 head of the other person. When you start to actually, so I'm sure you're doing things in

21:32.240 --> 21:38.160
 like precise detailed things with your hands to also indicate that you believe they're finished.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.800
 But you're facially just... See this? Yeah.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.640
 Quit. Oh, that's right, because it's facing you.

21:49.200 --> 21:54.720
 So that's ultimately what the battle is about. It's like, you're done. You might as well give up.

21:55.680 --> 22:04.160
 Commitment is so important in anything that you do, right? Like, I always kind of try and bring

22:04.160 --> 22:11.040
 things to a level of commitment that's uncommon. I think that that's a lot of reasons why I do well

22:11.680 --> 22:18.000
 is because I just get so committed in the whole process. And by the time that I actually show

22:18.000 --> 22:24.400
 up to fight, I sometimes just wish that they would kill me. I wish that they would, because that's

22:25.440 --> 22:31.200
 how far I want to go. People talk about how committed are you to the match. If you're committed

22:31.200 --> 22:39.680
 to the match and you lose, you should be hurt. I'm often unhappy when I lose a match and I don't

22:39.680 --> 22:45.120
 have an injury. I'm like, damn, what the fuck? I feel like I didn't commit.

22:47.600 --> 22:52.960
 I don't know if you know Dan Gable as the wrestler. Oh, yeah, he was on the podcast. Yeah.

22:54.960 --> 23:00.880
 He talked about his whole career. He dreamed of working so hard that he can't get off the

23:00.880 --> 23:08.800
 mat by himself. And he's disappointed ultimately at the end of his career because he was always

23:08.800 --> 23:15.280
 able to get off the mat on his own accord. So he wants to, yeah, leave it all on the mat just

23:15.280 --> 23:21.360
 from exhaustion. So that's what commitment looks like. But what is this process? What is this climb

23:21.360 --> 23:30.400
 for probably the toughest match of your career? I would say the most epic match in arm wrestling,

23:30.400 --> 23:38.240
 history. I mean, it's really building up. You said North America. I think

23:40.720 --> 23:45.680
 by a constant many, one of the greatest arm wrestlers ever. He is one of the scariest arm

23:45.680 --> 23:50.640
 wrestlers ever. And so this match, by the way, where's it happening? It'll be in Dubai.

23:51.840 --> 23:59.760
 June. So what does the climb look like? The climb for me, what I have to change in my life

23:59.760 --> 24:07.200
 always. People talk about being a professional. I've always loved the sport. I've loved it like

24:07.200 --> 24:20.080
 crazy. But to me, the path is about simplicity and removal of distractions. I do better and better

24:20.080 --> 24:31.040
 the more I get rid of everything, nothing else. So that my life is just the goal, just the target.

24:31.040 --> 24:37.600
 And everything else is off the table. And that's where I need to get to, where there's nothing.

24:37.600 --> 24:42.960
 There's nothing between me and him. And every single day, you're putting in the volume. Every day,

24:42.960 --> 24:48.800
 all day. Now, you said you worked out. So yesterday, you did hundreds of arm wrestling matches.

24:48.800 --> 24:52.480
 And then today, you said in the morning, you still worked out. So what was that workout?

24:52.480 --> 25:00.000
 So you're mixing up stuff where you're doing weights. Also, this morning, I try to really

25:00.000 --> 25:07.280
 focus on what's administratively easy. That's a big part of me, everything I do. So I just travel

25:07.280 --> 25:15.120
 with bands. Yeah, I got bands with me. And it's rehabilitative in nature. So I'm really focusing

25:15.120 --> 25:22.720
 on blood flow, feeling good, doing proper movements. But yeah, just band workout in the hotel.

25:22.720 --> 25:26.640
 What does a band workout look like? So are you doing the arm wrestling movement?

25:26.640 --> 25:32.880
 Oh, see that? See what you did there? What's that? Yeah, it's that you want to bring them in now.

25:33.520 --> 25:39.920
 Up, up, up, up, up, up, up into your center, right? You think what can you control out here?

25:39.920 --> 25:45.280
 Now, you bring everything close. That's it. Don't worry about pinning. Pinning happens

25:45.280 --> 25:51.040
 once it's close to you. People always think about pinning. You don't think about pinning.

25:51.040 --> 25:57.680
 How much of the body is a part of this too? Like the core, the torso, because it feels like

25:57.680 --> 26:03.440
 there's that almost like Mike Tyson punch power, right? Does it come from the hips too and the

26:03.440 --> 26:10.960
 legs? It's definitely the whole body. It's definitely the whole body. Like everything is

26:10.960 --> 26:16.480
 working. You're connected to the table at times as far as your base. Sometimes your base is your

26:16.480 --> 26:22.320
 feet. But a lot of times you can base off the table. So so you can base off your hips. But

26:22.320 --> 26:28.720
 I'll tell you, no arm wrestler cares about doing squats. No arm wrestler is doing planks.

26:28.720 --> 26:35.040
 Yeah. Okay. It's all about the forearm and the actions of the hand. That's always the limiting

26:35.040 --> 26:41.600
 factor. You look at a guy like Oleg Zock. Okay. Do you know this guy? Oleg Zock. Marvelous.

26:41.600 --> 26:46.560
 He's a total hellboy. He's my inspiration to what I call pumpkin training.

26:47.280 --> 26:53.840
 But what's pumpkin training? Probably we'll get into that, but I only train my right arm. That's

26:53.840 --> 27:02.000
 it. Yeah, with homework. But back to full body. It is full body. My good friend, Matt Mask,

27:02.800 --> 27:09.680
 when he arm wrestled me, he actually blew his internal abductor in his leg. So yeah,

27:09.680 --> 27:14.880
 people walk away from tournament. Their calves can be sore sometimes, you know, happens. But

27:15.680 --> 27:19.600
 no, oh, there he is right there. Yeah. Oh, like he is a real life hellboy.

27:19.600 --> 27:24.640
 He's like 170 pounds there. Look at his arm. Look at his arm.

27:24.640 --> 27:31.840
 It's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, he's totally crazy. That's you doing left right there. So by the way,

27:31.840 --> 27:39.760
 Levan, you're going right. Yeah. Yeah. So can you say more about the mental side? Are you

27:39.760 --> 27:44.960
 visualizing what it takes to beat him? Are you trying to get in his head? All of these things.

27:44.960 --> 27:52.640
 Do you think it's possible to get in his head? There's definitely strategies that you can do

27:52.640 --> 27:58.640
 depending on who it is you're facing. It's very good to know who it is you're fighting and choose

27:58.640 --> 28:07.520
 the correct strategy mentally. But I always follow a process when it comes to my mental

28:07.520 --> 28:16.000
 preparation. When I'm far away from an event, I just always build up my opponent. Build them.

28:16.000 --> 28:22.160
 I build them. I respect them. To a point where I almost start to fear them and start to believe

28:22.160 --> 28:27.680
 that they'll beat me. And this is a very vital part of my preparation. And that's where I am

28:27.680 --> 28:32.080
 right now with Levan. I don't, I just build them up, build them up into this thing that scares me.

28:32.080 --> 28:39.520
 And it forces me to be responsible. Because I don't want to lose. I want to win.

28:40.880 --> 28:45.280
 So the greater my opponent, the greater I can build their worth in my mind,

28:45.840 --> 28:52.560
 the more motivation it gives me. Then there comes a point when it changes.

28:53.680 --> 28:59.680
 And then I start to degrade them. And yeah, that's when it normally starts to get fun.

28:59.680 --> 29:09.360
 And normally by the time I face them, I just try and completely dominate from every interaction

29:09.360 --> 29:18.880
 from start to finish. Yeah. When in the actual moment of the match, in the moments leading

29:18.880 --> 29:27.840
 up to it, what's the feeling? Is it fear? Is it confidence? Anxiety? What's going through your

29:27.840 --> 29:40.880
 mind? I love to fight. I love it. I always have. There's every day where you have the distractions

29:40.880 --> 29:46.400
 of life. And then there's really living in the moment. That's whatever you love to do.

29:46.400 --> 29:53.520
 And that's when you can really be free. I'm free when I'm fighting. So you put me in

29:53.520 --> 29:57.760
 that good fight. And I just love it. And I don't think about the past. I don't think about the

29:57.760 --> 30:01.840
 future. I just think about killing that dude in front of me. And I enjoy that.

30:02.560 --> 30:07.760
 And just being intensely in the moment. That's it. Just right there. Just fighting as hard as I

30:07.760 --> 30:13.840
 can. Do you study the opponent? Do you have you for this particular match? Do you study videos of

30:13.840 --> 30:24.320
 Levan? I've seen everything. I've read everything. I get opinions from other people. I watch very

30:24.320 --> 30:32.160
 closely. What do you make of his evolution? So he's grown in size. But also, you've talked about

30:32.160 --> 30:43.520
 his evolution technically as well. Since we're in the build your opponent to be

30:44.560 --> 30:52.480
 terrifying stage, what makes him great? He's very impressive. The greatest thing about him

30:53.440 --> 30:59.280
 is his strength. That's the thing that sets him apart from everyone. His strength,

30:59.280 --> 31:06.320
 strength, specialized strength, exact strength for arm wrestling. I believe it's unmatched.

31:06.880 --> 31:14.960
 Can we just link around that word strength? What does strength mean? What does it feel like?

31:14.960 --> 31:24.640
 Are we talking about bicep, shoulder? Are we talking about whatever controls the wrist?

31:24.640 --> 31:33.280
 Yeah. How does strength manifest? When I touch your hand, when we grab arms, I feel like,

31:34.880 --> 31:39.280
 fuck, that's wrong. There's control. What is that feeling? Where does that come from?

31:39.280 --> 31:42.560
 In arm wrestling, when you're at the top of the world, where does that come from?

31:43.760 --> 31:49.680
 It's chains. There's chains of strength. In arm wrestling, this is like technical strength.

31:49.680 --> 32:00.960
 We use these technical chains to fight each other. Remember how we talked about the post,

32:00.960 --> 32:08.240
 this upwards drive, this ability to close this angle? This is a chain. It can be used.

32:08.240 --> 32:13.600
 It's a technical attack. It's also an attack that can be built with training. Just the ability to

32:13.600 --> 32:20.960
 drive upwards. There's a chain where you cup your wrist in. Cup your wrist in and the anchor and the

32:20.960 --> 32:26.480
 chain brings you right to your heart, right to your center. This chain, and this can be done at

32:26.480 --> 32:33.280
 any time. There's a pronation chain, and that's to turn your thumb over. Turn your thumb over

32:33.280 --> 32:38.480
 and you attack the person's cupping chain. There's a huge number of muscles involved in each of

32:38.480 --> 32:45.280
 those chains. That's why I say it's a chain, but they're movements, and these movements you can

32:45.280 --> 32:51.840
 develop in the gym or through practice. You don't mean it's easy to sort of interpret strength to

32:51.840 --> 32:59.920
 mean how much you curl, essentially, but you mean the chain. People talk is a bicep. I mean,

32:59.920 --> 33:05.760
 yes, there's bicep for sure involved, but I'll always be inaccurate if I try and tell you what

33:05.760 --> 33:11.520
 muscles are. I prefer to explain it in a movement, and then everything that's involved to do that

33:11.520 --> 33:20.400
 movement. And Levan's movements for arm wrestling are incredibly impressive. What do you attribute

33:20.400 --> 33:27.120
 to? How much of that is genetics? How much of it is some training thing he's doing?

33:27.120 --> 33:35.840
 I think that Levan is very special in terms of his genetics. Not everybody can be Levan.

33:37.600 --> 33:44.720
 There's not many Levan's out there, but what I've encountered in the bias that I always see,

33:45.040 --> 33:51.680
 when people talk about people like Levan, they discount the other side so very quickly. The

33:51.680 --> 33:57.040
 thing is Levan rarely has to show the other side because it's so far ahead. You talk about the

33:57.040 --> 34:03.360
 technical application of the sport. He so rarely needs to show it, but he's clearly incredible.

34:03.360 --> 34:11.040
 If you watch his progression, he came up having very difficult technical struggles to overcome.

34:11.040 --> 34:16.000
 Georgia is a great country for arm wrestling. There's this guy, Gennady Kvikvinia, who no one

34:16.000 --> 34:24.960
 would ever say is not technical. And it took him years to defeat him to a point where now it's

34:24.960 --> 34:29.520
 not even a discussion. You talk about the progression. They had a lot of battles together

34:29.520 --> 34:37.200
 over the years. It's fascinating to see the ties turn. And once they've turned, it's completely

34:37.200 --> 34:46.800
 different level. He's got strength. He's got technique. Some people will argue that his

34:46.800 --> 34:53.120
 technique is flawed at times. They've shown matches where he hasn't shown the best technique,

34:53.120 --> 35:00.400
 but he still won. And I think sometimes he just plays with people. There's a famous match that he

35:00.400 --> 35:10.000
 had with, they call him the Bruce Lee of arm wrestling. They had a match in the top eight.

35:10.960 --> 35:18.800
 Great match. Kurt Gally is like 220 pound guy from Kazakhstan. Brilliant technician,

35:18.800 --> 35:26.640
 but power wise, not in the same world. And Kurt Gally did well, even though he lost 6 nothing.

35:26.640 --> 35:33.680
 He still did well. But in my opinion, Levan didn't care. Levan was like grabbing him low and just

35:33.680 --> 35:42.080
 like whatever. I will show him things that he's not seen before. I will. He hasn't competed often

35:42.080 --> 35:49.680
 in this ruleset, which will be a challenge for him. But yeah, what can I say? Levan, he's Everest.

35:50.400 --> 35:56.480
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you are seen by basically everybody as the big, big underdog. But you're

35:56.480 --> 36:05.120
 also even in the Eastern, I mean, I talk to Russians a lot. You know that moment in Rocky

36:05.120 --> 36:11.600
 when they start cheering for Rocky? They love you. They want you to win. And just,

36:11.600 --> 36:18.640
 you know, it's not even just the battle itself is inspiring. And it's like the culmination

36:18.640 --> 36:24.480
 in your career. Because it's, you know, you're at the top for a long time, but it's like it's

36:24.480 --> 36:31.120
 almost like it should be over for you. But no, you're returning. It is like this big moment.

36:32.160 --> 36:37.360
 The big climb. I will be the pointy end of the spear for North America.

36:37.360 --> 36:45.040
 Yeah. Beautiful. Well, let's thanks for bringing that match up. Let's talk about just

36:47.280 --> 36:54.880
 the match against Dennis, your left hand match. He's also terrifying and seems one of the strongest,

36:54.880 --> 37:03.120
 probably the one of the strongest left hand arm wrestler. There's a lot to be said there.

37:03.120 --> 37:07.840
 Maybe you could talk about this match at a high level. Why did you take on this match?

37:07.840 --> 37:11.520
 Why did you do the left hand versus the right hand? What can you tell the story?

37:12.240 --> 37:19.200
 Okay. Dennis the Plankoff. There's so much about this match. I love Dennis. Russian guy.

37:19.200 --> 37:22.880
 Yeah. Russian guy. Russian. I used to call him Dennis Chernobyl.

37:22.880 --> 37:36.480
 What a monster. He kind of led, I'd say, this new era of arm wrestling where the super heavy

37:36.480 --> 37:42.160
 weight strength level has just gone through the roof. I wanted the match for such a long time.

37:42.160 --> 37:47.440
 We tried to get the match. We couldn't get it organized. This is back in like, you know, 2008

37:47.440 --> 37:51.760
 to 2012. Couldn't get the match. Couldn't get the match. I've always been more of a one on one

37:51.760 --> 37:57.680
 puller. He was doing the tournament format. I was ranked number one in the world and towards

37:57.680 --> 38:03.520
 the end, it kind of was very undecided. I ended up getting surgery. I ended up

38:03.520 --> 38:07.040
 abandoning the super heavyweight division. I went down to 225 for a few years.

38:08.880 --> 38:16.320
 WAL failed temporarily. So the 225 pound division was scrapped and I said, okay,

38:16.320 --> 38:23.360
 okay, I'm going to go for the big crown once again. And I started to go after super heavyweights.

38:26.000 --> 38:37.200
 The 2018 season was right hand. I started to enter negotiations to have the match with him.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.040
 We'd been chasing the match for 10 years. They wanted to do a left hand. I wanted to do a right

38:43.040 --> 38:48.640
 hand. I just wanted to do the match. I wanted to do the match with Dennis. I wanted to meet Dennis.

38:48.640 --> 38:53.520
 So people should know that the right hand has always been your strongest.

38:53.520 --> 39:00.000
 It has been, I mean, I had surgery in 2016. I hate to make excuses. I hate to do it.

39:01.760 --> 39:07.120
 Dennis was better than me that day, even on my best day. If you had gone back my entire career,

39:07.760 --> 39:12.960
 at no single day, do I beat Dennis the Plankoff in 2018? I would like to think that I could maybe

39:12.960 --> 39:18.080
 do it now. But at that point, there would have been no version that could have beat him.

39:19.040 --> 39:25.440
 Left or right? Right hand, no. I'm curious about the right. But left hand.

39:25.440 --> 39:34.240
 So is the world. Well, it might still happen. It might. But Dennis completely destroyed me.

39:34.240 --> 39:44.400
 And I learned a lot from it. I think before the Dennis match,

39:45.280 --> 39:51.120
 I think I was, I don't know, I don't know exactly what words to use. Maybe I felt like

39:51.840 --> 39:58.640
 my thinking was a little bit elitist. And I really learned a lot. I was really humbled that day

39:58.640 --> 40:08.480
 by how far and how professional and how prepared Dennis was and how seriously he took the sport.

40:09.280 --> 40:17.360
 There's a mental, a slightly terrifying calmness to him, which only comes with extreme preparation,

40:17.360 --> 40:30.960
 I think. His level of dedication was extremely inspiring to me. I used to do a job where

40:33.200 --> 40:40.480
 it was serious enough that the price could be death. And I arm wrestled throughout that entire

40:40.480 --> 40:50.560
 period. And I always kind of looked at the cost of doing an activity, being death,

40:52.880 --> 41:01.200
 limited to soldiering. And I kind of changed my mind a lot after that match. I realized that

41:02.000 --> 41:07.520
 anything that you're in love with, once you get far enough down the road and professional enough

41:07.520 --> 41:12.880
 at it, it's going to kill you. It doesn't matter what you're doing. If you're crazy enough about

41:12.880 --> 41:20.320
 anything, it's probably going to take your life from you in some way. And that doesn't mean you

41:20.320 --> 41:24.880
 rush towards death. It's just your level of investment and level of risk can have some

41:24.880 --> 41:30.000
 catastrophic effects. Bukowski, Charles Bukowski, I think has the quote,

41:30.000 --> 41:39.040
 do what you love and let it kill you. Right. Like that. Right. And I understood that Dennis's level

41:39.040 --> 41:46.960
 of professionalism far exceeded mine in what we were doing at the time. And I realized that,

41:46.960 --> 41:53.360
 you know, I was no longer employed. I was now in the world of professional arm wrestling.

41:53.360 --> 42:01.280
 And I realized that, uh, you know, what was I doing? Like how serious was I? So Dennis is an

42:01.280 --> 42:08.080
 incredible guy. Is there moments in that match? There's humility there too from him. That was a

42:08.080 --> 42:15.520
 fascinating, uh, sort of, it seemed like you realized that you just hit a wall and you were not ready

42:15.520 --> 42:20.960
 enough for it. It was incredible. There was so many things that I remember about the Dennis match.

42:20.960 --> 42:26.640
 I mean, I remember, you know, seeing video of somebody and then meeting them in person. It's

42:26.640 --> 42:31.760
 different. I remember in the weigh ins, sorry, not the weigh ins and the standoff that we did,

42:31.760 --> 42:37.840
 you know, before the match, I'm looking at him like I'm close. I'm looking at his arms and his

42:37.840 --> 42:46.400
 bicep, it looked like an ass. Like it was like a freaking glute muscle. Like his entire structure

42:46.400 --> 42:55.760
 was so sinewy and just so strong. I was like, wow, look, he's physically so impressive. And, um,

42:56.480 --> 43:03.600
 I remember when I arm wrestled him a certain at a certain time, he allowed me to kind of set my

43:03.600 --> 43:10.080
 position. You can vary. You can't really tell because it happens very quickly, but he let me set

43:10.080 --> 43:16.880
 my position, which means I kind of got my locks in where you can kind of really do a great hold.

43:18.000 --> 43:25.600
 And he just ripped through me. So you, you were able to get this great position. So it was tore

43:25.600 --> 43:32.800
 right through me. Yeah. And the first time I ever thought that, you know, he that I had torn

43:32.800 --> 43:36.880
 something, I thought like after the match, I'm like, geez, did he rip my chest right in half? Like

43:36.880 --> 43:43.840
 um, what, what, did it? No, it's 100%. Yeah. No, I didn't, I didn't actually,

43:43.840 --> 43:51.280
 nothing went purple or anything, but um, yeah, the strength gap was very significant with Dennis.

43:52.880 --> 44:00.080
 Could he, what would it take to beat him on that day? Um, it would, it would take me just being

44:00.080 --> 44:09.120
 a little bit stronger, um, and, and more healthy. Yeah. Uh, my left was not as healthy as it should

44:09.120 --> 44:15.600
 be. Like I didn't have a full rounded technical arsenal because it takes a time after surgery.

44:15.600 --> 44:22.080
 It really does. Like, I mean, you can be good, but after a surgery, like what I had, you know,

44:22.080 --> 44:26.640
 you're probably looking at three or four years before you're starting to hit technical proficiency

44:26.640 --> 44:32.960
 the way you should be. And uh, yeah, just a bit stronger. How do you interpret the calmness on

44:32.960 --> 44:38.880
 his face? Well, what is that about? Is he actually that Russian? It's a Russian thing, I think. I

44:38.880 --> 44:44.000
 don't know. I see a lot of Russians like that, you know, they're so like stoic and I'm such a

44:44.000 --> 44:48.080
 fan of Russia. I really want to go to Moscow. I've been saying it forever. You've never been,

44:48.080 --> 44:53.360
 not yet, not yet. I want to go, I want to just go and live there for like a month and just train.

44:53.360 --> 44:57.520
 Moscow has got such a crazy arm wrestling scene. They've got, from what I understand,

44:57.520 --> 45:01.280
 they just have so many clubs. There's so many strong athletes. Just go and just

45:01.840 --> 45:09.680
 lightning rod. Yeah. Have you considered doing something of that sort? It's like Rocky 4 again.

45:09.680 --> 45:14.800
 Oh yeah. Like, oh, and lead up to June. I would certainly consider it. I've got

45:15.440 --> 45:21.840
 only one trip planned at the moment. Administration is very important.

45:21.840 --> 45:25.280
 What do you mean by administration? So like managing your time?

45:25.280 --> 45:30.240
 Management. Yeah. The management has to be very efficient. You know, when I'm a tourist,

45:30.240 --> 45:35.680
 when I'm a visitor, a little bit of that goes down. You know, when I'm at my home and things are

45:35.680 --> 45:42.080
 familiar, I've got a really great grasp of my time. You know, everything's in place. Everything's

45:42.080 --> 45:48.320
 perfect. You know, if I could magically transport Moscow into my hometown and just go out and visit

45:48.320 --> 45:53.440
 them. Yeah. So it's very difficult when you're traveling. You have to keep all the, you have to

45:54.160 --> 45:58.880
 figure out what you're eating, how you get in the food, all the socializing. Plus you're

45:59.680 --> 46:03.280
 more and more a celebrity. So there's a social interaction, which I don't know

46:04.080 --> 46:09.200
 how draining that could be on you outside of the arm wrestling table. So you have to manage all of

46:09.200 --> 46:16.960
 that because ultimately you have to focus on the fight ahead. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of my strength

46:16.960 --> 46:24.400
 comes from just being in a familiar place, doing my routine. I love to travel. I love to get out

46:24.400 --> 46:32.320
 there and meet people and new experiences. But when I just want to really prepare for a big match,

46:32.320 --> 46:39.360
 yeah, home is where I get strong. So that loss against Dennis was one of the few losses in your

46:39.360 --> 46:47.520
 career. How did that feel in the moments after and the days after and the months after and the

46:47.520 --> 46:56.880
 years after? How has it changed you as an arm wrestlers, a human being? Well, it's tough to lose.

46:58.320 --> 47:05.920
 Still haunt you? I don't think so. I actually was really happy to lose to Dennis because,

47:05.920 --> 47:10.320
 you know, sometimes when you lose a match, there's a lot of matches that have lost

47:10.320 --> 47:15.360
 where they upset me because I know I made a mistake. I didn't make a mistake with Dennis. He

47:15.360 --> 47:20.720
 was just, he was just way better. There's nothing I could have done that day. I'm really at peace with

47:20.720 --> 47:27.680
 it. Dennis, to me, it was just a big inspiration. I think that me arm wrestling Dennis left handed

47:27.680 --> 47:32.800
 that day just let me touch probably one of the strongest human beings on the arm wrestling

47:32.800 --> 47:39.520
 table that's ever lived, you know, left handed. So knowing that's possible is almost like

47:40.880 --> 47:46.400
 inspiration to you that I can be at that level too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm seeing what Dennis did,

47:47.440 --> 47:52.800
 you know, just trying to absorb a little bit of his knowledge, planted seeds in me.

47:53.840 --> 48:00.640
 Yeah, I mean, when I look at my career, it's a bit like the stock market, but for sure I'm

48:00.640 --> 48:07.840
 trending upwards. And since really kind of wrapping my mind around some of the Russian

48:07.840 --> 48:14.400
 philosophies, they really changed my training systems. There was some base philosophies that

48:14.400 --> 48:20.800
 they talked to me about over there that massively impacted my training. Is it possible to convert

48:20.800 --> 48:24.640
 some of those philosophies into words? Can you describe some of the ideas they taught you?

48:24.640 --> 48:33.200
 So, never smile. Right? Man, it takes a while to break the ice with a lot of these guys.

48:34.480 --> 48:38.880
 Well, once you do, I mean, that's this deepest bonds you can form there. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

48:39.520 --> 48:48.000
 I think that I was raised under, I believe it's a flawed, I mean, it's not flawed because it has

48:48.000 --> 48:56.480
 its value as well. But it's best if you understand both philosophies. I think a North American thing

48:57.120 --> 49:06.960
 that's just so ingrained in our fitness society is no pain, no gain, you know, and just pushing and

49:06.960 --> 49:14.960
 like sweating and going harder and like fighting through like and grit and top and but and then

49:14.960 --> 49:19.840
 you talk to the Russians and they're like, yeah, never fail. You never fail. Never, never go to

49:19.840 --> 49:27.360
 failure. Always feel good. Always feel good. It should always feel good. Don't. And those two

49:27.360 --> 49:32.720
 philosophies express themselves very differently. I mean, if you want to get strong.

49:34.720 --> 49:40.560
 Yeah, don't fail. Don't fail. So that's how you, they also are believers of volume.

49:40.560 --> 49:49.600
 Yeah. There's a lot of strategies, but volume is a massive principle. And volume is very hard to

49:49.600 --> 49:55.600
 achieve when you're believing in no pain, no gain. Right. They don't really go together. No pain,

49:55.600 --> 50:02.320
 no gain, more injuries. So the, is there parallels? Because in wrestling, some of the greatest

50:02.320 --> 50:09.040
 wrestlers of all time are Russian and they were big, Daniel talks about it, they were big on play

50:09.040 --> 50:15.520
 right. Like lighter wrestling is probably ultimately actually, it boils down to that's

50:15.520 --> 50:21.760
 how you achieve higher volume. Right. Like over the stretch of years, the way to reduce injury.

50:23.840 --> 50:32.080
 I mean, in wrestling also technique might have greater value than it does in arm wrestling.

50:32.080 --> 50:39.280
 Obviously technique is extremely important in arm wrestling, but power is like can defeat technique.

50:39.280 --> 50:46.560
 It seems like in wrestling, you can get away. There's a lot of ways you can really do sneak attacks,

50:46.560 --> 50:51.920
 sort of use leverage on those kinds of things. So there's even more incentive to do play and

50:51.920 --> 50:57.440
 all that kind of stuff. But do you see the parallels between the two worlds wrestling and

50:57.440 --> 51:02.800
 arm wrestling? 100%. You saw what I did the other night. Right. So I'm playing on the table for

51:02.800 --> 51:11.760
 hours. Right. So that's my number one training thing that I do is I go on the table for hours

51:11.760 --> 51:17.760
 and I play. Yeah. Yeah. When you did circuit, can you pull up that video? It's on devil's channel,

51:17.760 --> 51:25.840
 the water tank one. Oh, it's like 180p. It's like the Wi Fi in there was so bad. Yeah. It's great.

51:25.840 --> 51:32.400
 I love it. I don't know if it was fish eye, but it had a fish eye feel. It was crowded. I mean,

51:32.400 --> 51:42.160
 so much camaraderie. It was amazing. But maybe just a brief mention of Dmitry, the Russian guy.

51:45.280 --> 51:50.480
 In that play, what are some memorable things here? Like when you go against a bunch of different

51:50.480 --> 51:55.280
 people, a bunch of strangers, what are all the differences and how do you grow from them?

51:55.280 --> 52:01.920
 How do you learn from them? Well, everybody's a bit different. So I love to go to new clubs

52:01.920 --> 52:06.880
 because the energy's always high. Like the first time you go to a club, everybody's trying to kill

52:06.880 --> 52:13.440
 you. Yeah. Yeah. So there's excitement. And so you feed off of that. Yeah, you do. If you're able

52:13.440 --> 52:19.600
 to be strong enough to absorb it without injury, it's awesome. It's awesome. Because they're giving

52:19.600 --> 52:26.720
 you everything they can. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So it's very specific, right? Like I'm going to get

52:26.720 --> 52:31.840
 way stronger at arm wrestling. And what I try and do when I go to these places is I make an

52:31.840 --> 52:39.680
 assumption. I make an assumption that I'm the best guy there. And so I'll arm wrestle in a way that

52:39.680 --> 52:46.000
 kind of protects them. Because the more I can protect them and kind of keep them kind of in a

52:46.000 --> 52:52.640
 good position, they can actually give me more. Right? So I kind of give them little pieces

52:52.640 --> 52:59.680
 that I think will put them in a place that they can really give me more. And so yeah, that's what

52:59.680 --> 53:05.360
 I'm doing. And then when I see somebody like Dimitri, I pull that in a little bit. Right?

53:06.080 --> 53:13.680
 So I know Dimitri's the number one guy in Texas. You know, lots of respect to the guy. I won't give

53:13.680 --> 53:19.680
 him all the pieces until I really kind of gauge where he's at. Because I certainly in training

53:19.680 --> 53:26.320
 don't want to fail. I don't want that. I don't want to, when you fail in arm wrestling, it's just

53:26.320 --> 53:30.640
 imagine it's just bad technique. And you're trying and bad technique, you're going to get hurt.

53:31.280 --> 53:36.240
 Yeah. So you always want to be in a strong position here. What about, how does endurance

53:36.240 --> 53:41.520
 come into play here? And here's video strapping up with Dimitri. Yeah. How do you, I mean, you

53:41.520 --> 53:47.200
 went for like, I don't know, two hours? Yeah, it was long. So the first, this first run of the video,

53:47.200 --> 53:51.920
 I think was a little over an hour and then I took a break and I probably did another 45 minutes or

53:51.920 --> 53:59.680
 so. But I mean, do you, how can, are you okay with the endurance aspect of this? Yeah, that's

53:59.680 --> 54:03.440
 probably like when you talk to the arm wrestling world, that's probably what I'm best known for,

54:03.440 --> 54:08.720
 is my endurance. So this helps build that? It does. But that's not why I'm doing it.

54:08.720 --> 54:14.720
 I'm doing it to get strong. In my opinion, this is, this is one of the best ways to get strong,

54:14.720 --> 54:19.120
 especially far away from it, from an tournament, or any kind of an event.

54:21.600 --> 54:28.080
 I wouldn't want to do this, you know, even a month or even six weeks, or even maybe even eight

54:28.080 --> 54:34.960
 weeks before a big event, I'd want to already be kind of shrinking my volume. But far away from

54:34.960 --> 54:39.440
 an event, yeah, as much volume as your body can handle, and you'll feel it, you'll feel it. Like,

54:39.440 --> 54:44.240
 I felt it at times, like, you know, after the hour mark, I'm like, okay, I can feel my blood sugar

54:44.240 --> 54:49.360
 kind of diminishing. I can feel like the blood that's going to my muscles is kind of like,

54:50.480 --> 54:55.040
 it's not really pushing more good stuff in, it's starting to, I'm starting to break down.

54:55.040 --> 55:01.200
 And you don't want that. You don't want that. Quick pause, bathroom break? I'm good. I kind of

55:01.200 --> 55:06.640
 need one. I'll maybe get a sweater. It's a bit, is it cold? Does that matter? Does that care for

55:12.000 --> 55:17.440
 And I still love the idea of you going to Russia. Yeah. And training there. Yeah. I'm also making

55:17.440 --> 55:22.000
 a trip out to Russia. Oh yeah, when? For different reasons. Well, it's hard with the current conflict,

55:23.120 --> 55:29.040
 the tensions there, but I'm hoping before your match actually, so May for a couple of interviews

55:29.040 --> 55:35.520
 with a couple of folks, some of which people know. Maybe I could ask you about

55:37.520 --> 55:43.040
 to comment on some matches that stand out to you in your career. Sure.

55:45.440 --> 55:50.720
 Is there something, is there a particular, I have a bunch that I really enjoy, but is there

55:50.720 --> 55:58.720
 something that stands out to you as, as memorable? We talked about sort of a defining loss perhaps

55:58.720 --> 56:08.320
 to Dennis. Then you, you faced Michael Tyler, like we mentioned, John Berserk, you faced Matt.

56:09.760 --> 56:14.800
 Is there something that stands out to you that technically or psychologically you've

56:15.440 --> 56:21.040
 learned a lot from? I feel like I try and learn something from every match, but there is a very

56:21.040 --> 56:32.000
 special match to me that to this day, I can't explain. Very weird phenomena. So I think it was

56:32.000 --> 56:45.280
 2005. It was my first combat tour overseas. So it was a active tour. You know, among other

56:45.280 --> 56:51.760
 things, I, I got shot during that tour, like we got blown and long tour, rough tour. And I trained

56:51.760 --> 56:57.120
 the whole time through knowing that at the end of this, I was going to have a big match. So

56:58.320 --> 57:04.880
 there's a champion, got called Ron Bath. He's kind of, if there was no Jon Bersink,

57:04.880 --> 57:11.440
 there would be Ron Bath. Okay. So extremely decorated, unbelievable arm wrestler from

57:11.440 --> 57:17.440
 United States. And this is kind of when I was just kind of coming up in the sport still,

57:17.440 --> 57:21.920
 I was fairly well established. I was definitely the best guy in Canada. And I had been for a few

57:21.920 --> 57:31.360
 years, but I hadn't really expanded internationally too much. So I had a one on one match with Ron

57:31.360 --> 57:41.440
 Bath. And that's the one. Yeah. Extremely hard fought battle was three one, I think three one,

57:41.440 --> 57:48.160
 but every match was really close. And he won the first one. And I had to kind of like dig my way

57:48.160 --> 57:55.120
 out of the trenches and ended up coming back and winning. But it was a match that was probably,

57:55.120 --> 58:02.240
 it was probably one of my closest matches ever. And it was seems like there's frustration on you.

58:02.240 --> 58:07.840
 What is that? What was going through your mind here with these? Was it first of all going in?

58:07.840 --> 58:11.920
 Did you think you could beat him? What was the level of confidence? I always think I can win.

58:11.920 --> 58:19.440
 I can always do. But you know, a lot of respect to the guy. But yeah, I mean, I always think I can

58:19.440 --> 58:26.080
 do it. So how did, what lessons did you take away from it? Why is it so meaningful to you?

58:27.280 --> 58:32.560
 Well, it's what happened afterwards. So I had some kind of a release afterwards.

58:33.840 --> 58:44.800
 And that was the strange thing to me. So match ended. And I felt like so relaxed afterwards,

58:44.800 --> 58:52.400
 so calm, so, so, you know, satisfied. Because it was one of those matches that kind of takes

58:52.400 --> 59:01.360
 everything from you. But you win it. And I was relaxing in the chair. And I've never had the

59:01.360 --> 59:08.720
 sensation before. I've never had it afterwards. But it's like the center of my backbone just

59:08.720 --> 59:16.320
 exploded. And it was like, so weird, right? Because I'm not really spiritual that much,

59:16.320 --> 59:22.000
 or religious even. But it's like a fire just ripped through me. And it only lasted an instant,

59:22.640 --> 59:29.840
 just exploded through my whole body out at the top, through my feet. And then it was gone.

59:29.840 --> 59:37.920
 That was it. Weirdest thing I've ever felt my entire life. Yeah, but it was it was as a result of

59:37.920 --> 59:42.240
 what happened in the match. And leading up to it, I had some kind of a release.

59:46.640 --> 59:53.040
 How did you interpret it psychologically? Was it like some kind of, I mean, not to be spiritual

59:53.040 --> 1:00:00.560
 or whatever, but some kind of superpower that was like, like a lingering feeling like, holy

1:00:00.560 --> 1:00:09.440
 shit. I, you know, I can't I can't explain it. And I haven't really tried hard enough to try to.

1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:14.800
 But something changed. Something happened there. Yeah. Something happened to me. I was sore for

1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:19.920
 about three or four months afterwards. It's like it smoked out my entire body. Yeah, that whole

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:25.760
 summer I was kind of sore. And yeah, and then after that, like two or three years later,

1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:31.840
 that's when I won the world championships. Yeah, I mean, all the matches are, you know,

1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:37.120
 you get something from people, like, you know, you study them, you, you take something from them.

1:00:37.840 --> 1:00:43.600
 People have an invisible crown and he had one. And I think I took it from him.

1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:49.440
 Maybe that was the feeling of wearing the crown. Yeah, maybe.

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:54.720
 What about all the trash talk? How much of that did you learn? Is that come naturally to you?

1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:59.920
 You're, you're one of the most charismatic fun. I mean, there's always like respect behind it.

1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:04.800
 I would say to me, and I'm a fan of a lot of sports, you're one of the greatest trash

1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:09.840
 talkers in all of sports that I've ever seen, because you're able to talk shit.

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:15.760
 But there's so much love and respect behind it. It's just masterful. But you'll also get into

1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:21.520
 people's heads in the moment. It's beautiful to watch because it really gets, it gets to some

1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:25.440
 people. So where does that come from? It's powerful weapon, right? Yeah.

1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:31.440
 As to your voice is a powerful, powerful weapon. And it's underutilized by so many athletes,

1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:38.720
 because they think that it's not sportsman like or something like that. But the truth is, I mean,

1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:48.080
 you can be a weak person, but with your voice, you can influence and change any number of things.

1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:54.080
 And the same thing happens in a, in a, in a fight between two people. If you can just be a never

1:01:54.080 --> 1:02:02.400
 ending, you know, flow of negative encouragement to someone or, you know, you know, suggestion,

1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:12.400
 anything can happen. It's a tool. And when you're fighting a person, you're not just fighting them.

1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:20.400
 You're fighting everyone who's watching. You're fighting the crowd, the referees. And you know,

1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:26.400
 to get in the most ideal positions, situations, you need to use your voice. Yeah.

1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:31.600
 Yeah. And there's a, for people who haven't seen, I definitely recommend you watch a bunch of

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:35.920
 arm wrestling matches, because there's a crowd really gets into it. And it feels,

1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:39.600
 it feels like there's a really intimate connection with the crowd, I suppose,

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:43.680
 I suppose, because the crowd is allowed to be very close to you. I love it.

1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:49.520
 I want the crowd like right up on me. Yeah. Yeah. So sometimes,

1:02:51.920 --> 1:02:57.760
 oh yeah. So who are you? Whenever you talk to somebody, you literally pick somebody from the

1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:03.440
 crowd. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I'll, I'll, I'll fuck him. Like I'll start fucking off his fans and like,

1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:11.440
 yeah, like I'll start talking to their wives or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. There's Jody.

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:18.640
 She's pretty dangerous to listen to also. But yeah, one of his buddies, Mike Salaris, who's,

1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:24.320
 you know, really good arm wrestler was, was talking, was, was cheering for him. So I started

1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:31.680
 go after him. Yeah. Yeah. Smiling the whole. Yeah. It's fun, right? It's fun. It's fun to listen to,

1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:36.640
 but it's also, what's fun is how much it actually affects some of the people you're facing. They

1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:42.240
 get frustrated. Yeah. It's great to see. Well, you have to fight, right? Like a lot of people think

1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:47.520
 things will be given to them. And the thing that, you know, I've always believed from the time I

1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:56.160
 was very young, like I was convinced that our inevitable death was going to come from aliens,

1:03:56.160 --> 1:04:02.560
 right? Like some super aggressive, super violent species was going to come and smoke us all.

1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:08.160
 You know, and I'm like, I'm, I'm not like that. I'm like, but as soon as one person is,

1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:18.000
 then you're forced to have to accept it as reality, right? So I like to fight for every single thing.

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:23.040
 I like to try and be more and more aggressive. And if someone matches me, that's when I can use

1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:28.640
 my endurance. And if they don't, then I have the tactical advantage. So that's kind of my balance

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:34.080
 point. And then by the way, you all see yall at the ref. Yeah. I mean, the game, there's like

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:38.720
 levels to this game, but you know, the feeling sometimes when people get frustrated is like,

1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:46.480
 okay, this person's cheating or like you're trying to get a good grip before the go before it goes.

1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:52.080
 And, and I think some of the frustration in combination with the trash talk is

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:57.680
 when this person is cheating, but everybody is like kind of trying to cheat, get an edge

1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:05.680
 within the rules. Yeah. So I try and just ramp it, ramp it, ramp it. But you know, everybody's

1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:11.120
 different. I've learned how to play the game based off of the tools that I have physically.

1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:18.000
 And for me, this works because, you know, my genetic makeup is more, I'm more of a

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:23.600
 persistence hunter, right? So like I need to extend things and that works well for me.

1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:31.600
 You know, if I was more explosive, I probably wouldn't have the same strategies. Yeah.

1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:37.920
 By the way, for people who are watching, you're wearing no limits hoodie, which is

1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:45.280
 one of your nicknames. I don't wash this thing too much. It's my bacterial shield to the world.

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:52.560
 Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. So you mentioned Jody. She's often in your corner and does perhaps

1:05:52.560 --> 1:05:59.520
 more trash talking than even you. So I mean, if we could step away, she's an incredible human

1:05:59.520 --> 1:06:05.840
 being is sort of as a fan. It's fun to watch the two of you, both when you're arm wrestling and

1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:14.720
 just as people, you just see so much, I don't know, kindness and love radiating from the two of you

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:20.480
 whenever you're trash talking or talking about just random things or just talking about life.

1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:24.480
 It's just a beautiful thing to watch. And thank you for sharing that with the world. But maybe

1:06:25.760 --> 1:06:32.080
 can you, she paid me to ask you this, but what are the things you love about Jody,

1:06:32.080 --> 1:06:37.280
 your wife, Jody Larrick? What are the ways she's affected your life?

1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:49.760
 Yeah. Jody and I go way back. We were in high school together. The thing that I admire most in

1:06:49.760 --> 1:07:02.800
 people is bravery. To me, it's the most admirable quality. And Jody always has inspired me because

1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:09.760
 she's such a fighter. You know, if she believes that something's true, she'll, she just, she

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:14.400
 does not back down. She will, she will not. And you can, not to say that she's can't change your

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:23.040
 mind because she can, but while she is convicted, she will, she'll not stop fighting. She's pulled

1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:29.440
 me out of the fire repeatedly. We've, we've lived through so many things. Very lucky.

1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:37.440
 How'd she made you a better arm wrestler? She's fed me. Yeah. I could see your, you have videos

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:44.400
 of your house basically coming apart when she's not there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Without Jody, I'm on

1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:55.840
 the street living in a tent and yeah, eating dog food. Yeah. Yeah. Bravery. Yeah. What about love?

1:07:55.840 --> 1:07:59.840
 How's love made you stronger? Now we're going to make a Devon uncomfortable.

1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:09.120
 Love is difficult to accept. Love is one of those things that, you know, a lot of times

1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:14.960
 you don't feel worthy of it, you know? And so it's hard sometimes to accept someone's love.

1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:23.600
 And someone who really loves you, they'll love you even when you don't, you know? And here you go,

1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:28.000
 you're going to make me cry, Lex. Yeah. Jody and I have been through so much.

1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:36.880
 And she's shown me how, you know, she's supported me just repeatedly, repeatedly.

1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:42.160
 Some of that is loyalty and patience and perseverance and all those things. That's like

1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:49.840
 when love really shows itself. Yeah. Sticking through together for years, even when you're

1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:56.000
 here, through the shitty times. Love and faith are powerful forces in this universe,

1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:02.880
 you know? Without them, we can descend into darkness very quickly, you know? As a world,

1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:10.880
 even between people, you know? When love and faith is destroyed, then we fall apart, you know?

1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:17.200
 And I've been graced by the love that Jody's given me, you know? It's allowed me

1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:21.920
 to continue to build, you know? When you have love between people, then you build together.

1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:30.400
 I love my family. I love Canada. I love the armwrestling community. I have a love for what

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:37.120
 we're trying to achieve as a human species, you know? And, you know, when that falls apart,

1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:50.800
 we don't have much. Yeah. She's with my boy there. Yeah. You also mentioned you once had a job where

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:56.160
 your death was a real possibility. You were in the Canadian Special Forces.

1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:05.040
 What did you take away from that experience, that time of life? Such a great life.

1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:10.720
 I really, really loved it. Honestly, I never wanted to leave. I never thought I would leave.

1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:19.360
 I thought I'd be there my whole life. Real honor to get to serve. What did you get to do?

1:10:19.360 --> 1:10:24.560
 What was the things you loved, craftsmanship wise, like fun things you get to do, learn and

1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:31.280
 challenge yourself? Yeah. And we mentioned sort of honor in terms of the serving part. Yeah.

1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:40.400
 Yeah. My favorite thing about serving in the Special Forces was, for sure,

1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:42.960
 the people that I worked with. That's probably the first thing I could say.

1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:51.440
 You know, I never, I always felt like totally comfortable and putting my life in the other

1:10:51.440 --> 1:11:00.560
 guys hands. I was so happy to be in a place where I felt I could follow. Like, it didn't matter.

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:04.880
 Like, I knew that the people ahead of me were incredible. I knew the people

1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:10.720
 beside me were incredible. So, just having that faith in your team, it's very special.

1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:15.520
 And to know that they're there for a reason that has nothing to do with money, you know,

1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:20.160
 and that's what kind of brings everybody together is you're there for a higher purpose.

1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:27.360
 And in terms of being an adrenaline junkie, there's nothing like it. I mean, there's nothing

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:33.600
 like, you know, going out at night and fighting. And when I say fighting, like, my whole life,

1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:42.240
 I wanted to fight. And to me, there's a lot of, and look, I've said this in the past,

1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:45.840
 and I think it's been a personal failure of mine, because I've said things like,

1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:49.920
 it's the highest level that you can do. And I don't believe that to be true anymore.

1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:58.000
 But at the time, I thought it was the best way I could express my drives that I had,

1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:04.000
 you know, to be a fighter. So, your sense in the past, and maybe in part now is that

1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:11.680
 sort of fighting is when humans get a chance to express themselves deeply. Like, that mix of

1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:19.680
 the bravery, the integrity, the whatever that is that makes us human, that human

1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:25.120
 spirit can really shine. And I don't believe that anymore. I believe that you can do that in any

1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:30.400
 field, in any discipline. You know, if you go hard enough, it all kind of starts to feel the same.

1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:38.320
 But at the time, that, you know, expression to me was really, really awesome. I loved,

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:42.560
 I loved close quarter battle. That was my favorite thing. That's really the whole reason I was there.

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:45.680
 Can you describe close quarter battle?

1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:52.720
 Close quarter battle is team fighting. So, and it can look a lot of different ways.

1:12:53.520 --> 1:13:02.000
 But basically, it's ground troops doing some kind of a mission. And it's the orchestrated

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:08.160
 movement that is the skill, the orchestrated movement, and the drills done quickly and

1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:10.960
 accurately. It's very difficult to do. With communication?

1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:17.360
 With communication. Yeah, so it's basically cooperating together, communicating. There's

1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:21.680
 some strategy, there's some adapting to the changing environment. And the more the team

1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:28.000
 works together, the less communication there is. Yeah. And that's an amazing thing to do,

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:34.640
 to be part of a machine, well, machine, a team of people who can fight together like that.

1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:41.840
 It's, I think it's, we're really designed to do it. Like as good as we can fight as individuals,

1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:46.640
 the thing that makes us really good is our ability to fight as a team. Yeah.

1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:51.040
 Yeah, where that's one of the things that makes us really human is that collective intelligence,

1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:57.360
 the social aspect. And fighting is the highest of stakes. So, like that social interaction

1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:03.760
 under the highest of stakes is, really does bring out something that's deeply human.

1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:13.360
 I mean, war in general brings out something deeply human. It's just, it's, I mean,

1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:20.480
 obvious to say that it's tragic that it results in so much loss of life and well being.

1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:29.920
 Let me, if it's okay for a brief moment to take us back to arm wrestling. We did this,

1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:33.840
 like offline, we talked about, you gave me some advice and I bought arm wrestling,

1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:40.560
 but maybe do a high level overview of like the different styles and strategies

1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:45.360
 that we've talked about. We talked about the importance of strength and power,

1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:51.760
 but is there like offensive defensive styles? Is there, we're mentioning King's move,

1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:57.120
 what would, what would you classify your style as? It's nice for people that don't

1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:07.440
 know, maybe even zoom back out. So, arm wrestling is a sport where two people have to,

1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:13.520
 when we talk about strictly the sport, put their elbow on a particular pad means they have to keep

1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:21.920
 that elbow on that pad and they win when the back of one of their hands crosses some kind of,

1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:30.960
 or basically touches the table. And when you actually lock up, you do so depending on the

1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:38.000
 organization without straps, meaning there's just you agree, it's like mutual agreement that you're

1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:45.120
 going to clasp your hands in a way that's fair and there's a referee that helps ensure that it's

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:49.840
 fair, but of course there's these little games going on. And then when you actually go all out

1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:55.760
 with this battle, if there's no straps, you can slip out. And so often you'll put the straps,

1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:03.040
 which means you're, it's like marriage, you're committed for, like somebody will have to lose

1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:11.280
 essentially. There's no pulling out. So, okay, so that's sort of the battle within that. What

1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:15.200
 are the different styles that you can speak to that people that don't know arm wrestling

1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:20.240
 could, could, could. Yeah, we can start to kind of just dance around the subject a bit.

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:31.280
 I'd say there's a lot of different types. There's specialists and there's kind of blenders and

1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:38.160
 people who are very versatile. A lot of guys win world championships on one singular move.

1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:46.800
 They get just extremely crisp at say a hook or a top roll and their style is very kind of focused

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:53.920
 and you'll see it with a lot of athletes, like kind of a talk guide, about guy who's very active,

1:16:53.920 --> 1:16:58.560
 guy called Jerry Cadorette. Okay, as soon as you think Jerry Cadorette, he's got a very unique

1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:04.640
 style. He's got a flop wrist press. Okay, so most of his technique is built around this one system.

1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:11.680
 Flop wrist means your, what it sounds like. So your wrist is flopped, so it looks like you're

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:18.800
 losing. So he is pushing from a losing position. No, he will be offensive. So he will be in a

1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:24.560
 press so offensively. So he'll give his hand away so that he can get his shoulder behind it properly.

1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:36.160
 So he doesn't, wow. So you can press means push, yeah, without having that hook position.

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:41.680
 Right, which is what most people are always looking for and Jerry's looking for it as well.

1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:45.280
 And then, so example, there's another one. There's another specialist, Matt Mask.

1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:52.960
 Yeah. He's a top roller, right. Basically, that's his great move, the top roll. And his other weapons

1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:59.360
 aren't nearly as powerful. Just incredible top roll. And then you have a lot of athletes that are

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:05.520
 more blended. Okay, they have a lot of good options. I think that I'd probably fall more into that

1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:14.160
 category. You have people who are more speed guys. Okay, so they try and do very little,

1:18:14.720 --> 1:18:20.640
 I'd call it attrition. Right, so a lot of people are very willing to trade energy.

1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:26.640
 Right, because they have faith that their gas tank or their pool eventually will tire the

1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:31.840
 other person out. So anytime there's a trade, they'll trade. Whereas, you know, a guy like Travis

1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:38.960
 Bajan, you know, he was very, very well known as being extremely explosive, right. But if the

1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:47.120
 match stops, typically he's going to lose. Right, so based off of your genetics, your hands,

1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:56.880
 you know, there's a lot of ways to skin it. So I think you said something like, you're a 20 second

1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:03.680
 guy. That's right. I'm a 20 second guy. So what are the seconds we're talking about? So a lot of

1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:09.600
 the power people, they want to win in the first maybe five seconds, like just that first push,

1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:16.080
 that first press. Absolutely. And that's it. Right to the pad. Yeah. And so you're trying to hold

1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:24.000
 off that attack. Yeah, if I beat you in a second, we're not in the same world. Yeah. When I'm with

1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:30.800
 my peer group, I will typically win 20 seconds and beyond. That's a typical win for me when I'm

1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:37.200
 with a peer. Whereas other guys, when they're with their peers, they'll win in a second. Right,

1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:44.640
 that's how they do it. That's the way they're built. That's the way they train. Yeah, most guys

1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:49.600
 at a higher level at all starts to kind of, it starts to get more and more difficult to be a

1:19:49.600 --> 1:19:57.120
 specialist at the high level now. Some people just have little holes in their games. It's rare

1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:05.120
 to get someone who can really do all the moves. It's very rare. What, where would you put Levan?

1:20:06.560 --> 1:20:12.240
 I would not say he's a specialist. I'd say his top roll is the strongest move. Top roll.

1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:18.880
 Top roll is the strongest move. Yeah. And the interesting thing about the specialist versus

1:20:18.880 --> 1:20:28.400
 the blender, there's a counter. Every move has a move that theoretically should be the right choice.

1:20:29.360 --> 1:20:34.720
 So if you're a single move guy, there's going to be a guy out there who'll get you.

1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:42.560
 Yeah, it'll be very difficult for you to beat that guy. But like when you come to like a tournament,

1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:48.960
 typically specialists do much better in tournament scenarios because their singular

1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:53.600
 move can get them through a tournament very quickly and efficiently. Whereas you get a

1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:59.120
 blender in a tournament, they typically will have longer and more difficult matches and by

1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:05.520
 the way, in super match format, typically blenders do better.

1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:12.000
 So we all find also talked about arm sumo or freedom arm wrestling. I don't know how you want

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:24.240
 to call it. Oh, I love freedom. Exactly. North American way. So this is this idea and I watched

1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:30.960
 a few videos and it looks fun is basically removing the restriction of having to keep your elbow on

1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:36.640
 the pad and just being able to arm wrestle over the whole table. I think you've mentioned that

1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:41.840
 the criticism that gets is it might be injury prone or something like that. So can you describe

1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:48.000
 this arm sumo freedom arm wrestling idea? Right. When you come to freedom arm wrestling, basically

1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:54.240
 it removes the limitation of a standard arm wrestling table. So basically every single thing

1:21:54.240 --> 1:22:00.080
 is a freedom arm wrestling table. Some are better than others. So looking for that nice table where

1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:06.080
 we can kind of stand apart from each other and we're anatomically in a fairly safe position

1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:13.440
 and the rules and freedom, the way you win is like the knuckles must either touch the tabletop

1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:20.320
 or you hold it off the edge for a three count. Right. So this is the main way to win. Yes,

1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:24.720
 you can foul like if you lift your elbow up, still a foul, but you have the entire playing

1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:30.480
 surface. So your elbow is no longer limited to your 7x7 or 7x9 pad. So you can move it all over

1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:35.920
 the table. You can move your body around the table a bit too. And if it's a big table, your body

1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:42.320
 could largely be on the table. Yeah. So basically it's like adjusting your ring size. So arm wrestling,

1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:46.880
 you're fighting in a phone booth. Yeah. Right. So you're fighting in a field, you're fighting,

1:22:46.880 --> 1:22:51.280
 you know, just bigger. So it just, it just makes the sport bigger. Yeah, this is Japan.

1:22:51.280 --> 1:22:57.840
 But even on a small table there, even in a slightly larger phone booth, you can get a lot more

1:22:58.560 --> 1:23:02.880
 fun and variety. It's very interesting to watch. I love it. I think it makes the sport bigger. I

1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:07.440
 actually believe that it's the future of the sport. I really do. Because it makes it more

1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:11.120
 accessible. Like you don't need the equipment, you can do it at a bar, all that kind of stuff.

1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:17.520
 Yeah. Yeah. Less equipment requirements. Most kids start freedom. Like most kids

1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:21.680
 arm wrestle on school desks. Yeah. Yeah. And like if you see a guy on the street,

1:23:21.680 --> 1:23:24.960
 like whatever, like you can arm wrestle anywhere, you don't need to bring your table around with you.

1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:34.640
 If we talked about the elite level, if somebody was interested in starting an arm wrestling,

1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:41.440
 or like going from just like, you know, you go to the gym, you kind of lift,

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:46.880
 you've arm wrestled a few times, trying to get better at it, trying to learn how would you advise

1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:54.000
 like getting better to where you can beat your closest buddies. Yeah. That first step. First step.

1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:58.640
 I'd say find people. Find people. Find good people.

1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:03.360
 There's volume. We'll get with the club. Get with people who know what they're doing,

1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:08.480
 who can mentor you. And that's really cool. I got to me. I realized there's a club in Austin.

1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:09.920
 Yeah. Sure. There's in a lot of places.

1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:14.320
 They're everywhere. We got this app called Armbet. Yeah.

1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:19.840
 Which is a app that helps you find other people there. Yeah. Very easy. But I mean,

1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:26.000
 they're all over social networks. I mean, it's kind of widespread now. But yeah, find people.

1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:32.960
 Find people. And it's just much easier to learn with another person. And you'll get stronger that

1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:40.720
 way. But I mean, do the lifts. If you go to the gym, just start doing the lifts. And right away,

1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:45.040
 those will technically prepare you. What are the lifts? Can we describe?

1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:50.640
 Yeah. So I'd say if you want to just keep it very, very simple. Let's just talk about three.

1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:55.280
 There's more. There's much more than three. But when you talk about energy allocation,

1:24:55.280 --> 1:25:04.000
 these three lifts, in my opinion, should be like 90% of your investment. It's very big,

1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:12.080
 these three lifts. And the exact percentages, you can argue about it. But we'll start off

1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:17.440
 with the cupping of the wrist. Just this. This is a simple thing. And do it with a cable.

1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:24.880
 You can get a thicker diameter. So it kind of is more out on your fingers. Where an arm rest

1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:28.400
 is going to attack you, right? Because any good arm rest is going to attack your fingers.

1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:34.320
 So like open hand. No. No. Well, I mean, for health, yes, you could. But like,

1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:38.880
 if you want to be really specific, you train exactly the way you would at a table in the

1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:43.440
 position that you actually start that match. And then you're just doing this kind of.

1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:50.240
 Yes. To your center. One of the big misconceptions in arm wrestling

1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:56.960
 is that you're aiming for that pin pad. Right. No. The center. The chest up here.

1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:00.800
 Bring it close to you. I make it come close to you, right? You see, like whenever I do my

1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:09.840
 exercises, the vector is always pulling straight towards me. Yeah. So just cupping close to you.

1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:13.520
 The most dangerous thing that a person can do to me on an arm wrestling match

1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:16.720
 is just pull me away from my body. That's a terrible thing for me.

1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:25.760
 Yeah. So that cupping, that's a massive part of the sport. So now when you think,

1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:32.480
 what does the cup do to the other person? If I cup, they get turned over, right?

1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:42.880
 So this has to get really strong. This pronation. So to fight that rolling.

1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:50.640
 Exactly. Yeah. So that's through the thumb. Yeah. Oh, so you put, got it. You put on the

1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:56.640
 thumb and you put this motion. Yeah. Got it. Yeah. And those two things, those two things

1:26:56.640 --> 1:27:01.520
 together, this cupping and rolling, this is what's going to make the person's hand bend back.

1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:07.840
 And once a person's hand is bent back, just their whole game gets cut to pieces.

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:14.400
 They have very little good options. It's all like nasty stuff. Wow. Yeah. So those two things,

1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:24.960
 that's a huge part of your investment rise. Always be climbing. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:30.640
 Those three simple things, that's what I would tell anybody to spend most of their time on

1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:35.520
 if you want to become an arm wrestler. And to use bands would be good for this.

1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:40.000
 Bands are great because they're easy to transport. The only problem I have with bands

1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.400
 is like, if you like to measure and if you like to be precise, bands just aren't that

1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:48.560
 precise. Right. To have growth. Yeah. Yeah. Just, I mean, it's just like,

1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:53.440
 you know, you know exactly what you need. The prescription is kind of, a band is kind of like,

1:27:53.440 --> 1:28:00.720
 and a lot of people, myself included, I like to know exactly my outputs. So weights.

1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:09.200
 So it would be like cables. Yep. Cables are nice. Bands are great too. I mixed the two. Bands are

1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:18.240
 when I kind of don't need to, they're more like easy for me. When I train bands, bands are dangerous

1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:21.920
 because the acceleration is so high on them. Like when you screw up with band training,

1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:27.840
 the acceleration is way faster than gravity, right? So if you do something bad, it can make

1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:34.080
 it go really much worse. Yeah. It's funny that you didn't mention bicep curls or,

1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:40.400
 well, it's a chain. It's a chain. And so you're, I mean, the idea, if you focus on these three,

1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:45.040
 the other stuff catches up, like it's all involved. This whole thing is involved.

1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:53.280
 So if you have an axe, right, the blade of the axe, that's these things, right?

1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:58.240
 Like you need the pointy end of all your attacks to be awesome.

1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:02.640
 Right. If you have a super sharp axe, you could have a shitty hand.

1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:08.800
 Yeah. Right. Yeah. So focus on that, the pointy tip of the axe.

1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:13.040
 Yeah. The tip of the axe is so important. Right. Like if I have an awesome bicep

1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:18.560
 and I can't quite use it, what's it good for? Right. Yeah. I think a lot of the motions with

1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:23.840
 the wrist that you mentioned are just thinking about jiu jitsu, especially in the gi. Yeah.

1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:29.040
 There's a lot of, I mean, there's so much importance to this and people don't often work

1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:36.400
 it explicitly. Yeah. So many of the chokes require ability to, it's almost like exactly

1:29:36.400 --> 1:29:41.920
 like arm wrestling. Very close. Because you're weak here, what's that called flop wrist. Yeah.

1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:49.520
 And you're strong with the cup. Yeah. And so just getting the muscle, whatever that's involved,

1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:54.000
 the muscle, the turning, the pressure, because that's where also the choke comes.

1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:59.120
 That little, the thing that makes you win in arm wrestling is also the thing that

1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:03.600
 finishes the person when you have them grabbed. The strength is very similar.

1:30:03.600 --> 1:30:08.080
 Yeah. It's fascinating actually. Of course, like you said, if you want to be very good,

1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:13.520
 you should be doing the very specific exact motion. Yeah. So if I was going to do jiu jitsu,

1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:19.840
 I'd be like working out with the gi. Yeah. The problem is, you know, it's difficult to construct

1:30:21.200 --> 1:30:27.120
 the exact, so you have to actually go with people and then they don't like being choked on.

1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:33.840
 Right. So like it's hard to, I'm actually a big, we have these kinds of debates all the time is,

1:30:33.840 --> 1:30:40.560
 you know, I'm a big believer in drilling. I love doing something thousands of times.

1:30:40.560 --> 1:30:45.200
 Like John Donahar, somebody I mentioned to you about the jiu jitsu folks here,

1:30:45.920 --> 1:30:54.000
 they're less believers in drilling. They see the value of almost like the mind of going live

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:58.800
 and exploring ideas that's that play. You don't need to do the thing a thousand times.

1:30:58.800 --> 1:31:05.760
 You just need to always be thinking about the little details that make you better and then

1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:12.240
 inaction practicing, like developing the strength, the power, the explosive of the agility in action.

1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:20.000
 So actually rolling. I don't, you know, I agree with this, but I just believe in volume more.

1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:23.680
 Yeah. So you can accomplish it through volume. You can play a lot.

1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:29.680
 Yes, exactly. Well, that's the way, if you really want to get it good is you're talking about,

1:31:30.240 --> 1:31:34.720
 I mean, that's why a lot of these folks are training three times a day. They're doing,

1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:41.680
 you know, they're putting in the hours, eight hours, nine hours, just just tough. Oh my god.

1:31:41.680 --> 1:31:45.520
 Well, so there are a lot of them are not doing going hard. It's just being on the mat. Some of

1:31:45.520 --> 1:31:50.560
 it is just sitting there talking through ideas, watching others or teaching, explaining stuff.

1:31:50.560 --> 1:31:56.160
 It's just, it's like, it's not just physical. It's, it's a mental too, because you're keeping

1:31:56.160 --> 1:32:02.080
 in your mind and some of the greatest, that's what they talk about. The wrestlers I've talked

1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:10.160
 with, the fighters at the top of their career, they basically, George St. Pierre is like this,

1:32:10.160 --> 1:32:17.200
 another fellow Canadian is like his stick figures in his head. They can't help. Yeah.

1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:23.280
 They're like in there because if you train enough hours, you're, it's just going to be in your head

1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:27.840
 and they're all going to be playing around in your head and some little detail over time. It's

1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:33.040
 almost like computing or something like that. And that ends up having a result even though you're

1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:40.560
 not physically doing anything. It's, it's, it's always in there. I do have to return to diet

1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:47.440
 real quick. I know we're talking about pancakes. Let me, quite seriously, you are one of the,

1:32:49.040 --> 1:32:55.680
 I mean, strongest athletes in the world for your sport. So you have to get big. You have to get

1:32:55.680 --> 1:33:03.920
 powerful. You have to get strong. What is the right diet for you for that? Like, what do you eat?

1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:10.800
 How often do you eat? Yeah. Yeah. From the highest detail to the smallest or the things that make

1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:18.400
 you happy and feel good. Yeah. I've experimented with every diet. I've done it all. I've been a

1:33:18.400 --> 1:33:27.040
 vegan. I've done raw. I've eaten only meat. I've eaten balanced. I've eaten like a bodybuilder.

1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:36.560
 You know, you name it. I've probably tried it. I don't believe that it's as important in the sport

1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:44.560
 of arm wrestling as it is perhaps in other sports. I believe that, I mean, just to be very basic,

1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:51.120
 I mean, if you're eating enough food, you're probably going to be okay. So it's just calories?

1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:58.560
 It's a lot. I mean, really, not to overcomplicate it, but I mean, that's where the conversation

1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:06.960
 starts. So you're eating enough food and it can come in any number of ways. And I don't think it's

1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:14.000
 as important as a lot of other people do. I'm certainly irresponsible in a lot, but the thing

1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:23.760
 is, back to volume, right? If you want to be a super heavyweight, it's very different than if

1:34:23.760 --> 1:34:28.480
 you want to be a weight category guy. If you want to be a weight category guy, I'd say that you need

1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:35.440
 to be more responsible, make better choices. If you want to be a super heavyweight, everything.

1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:39.520
 We're watching a delicious looking omelet, so eggs, bacon,

1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:46.960
 syrup, so you don't care carbs. So in all the things you try, so I mostly eat meat now. And I

1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:54.000
 landed on that. There's several things, obviously I'm not, but I do a lot of sport. And I was very

1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:01.360
 surprised how my particular, very specific body can perform better with only meat. Why better?

1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:06.880
 The sports I do, the mind matters. And so for some reason, my mind is just clear. And I don't

1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:11.680
 think, because it feels unhealthy. It just makes me feel really good. I don't think I would recommend

1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:20.480
 it to anybody else. So it's interesting that that journey of just exploring can take you to figure

1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:26.080
 out something about your own self. One of the most interesting things that I heard about nutrition

1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:37.600
 was, I heard there was actually Doritos. I'm an idiot. Now, I'd say over the last couple

1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:44.000
 of years, I've really gone into carbs a lot and high glycemic carbs. And I feel like it's one of

1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:48.320
 the best things you can do if you're working out really hard, just add carbs. Yeah, exactly.

1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:57.440
 But oh, where was I? So good. So you've got distracted.

1:35:57.440 --> 1:36:01.600
 Syrup is, I forget everything. It's just distracting. No, so you've added high

1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:06.560
 glycemic carbs into the mix. So those help, but that's for mass building.

1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:12.000
 Right. So there was a study that I heard about by somebody who's trying to identify

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.400
 heart attacks. They did this great big study. And at the end of it, I mean,

1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:21.760
 didn't matter what the people ate. The most important thing was how they felt about the

1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:28.640
 food that they were eating. Yeah. So if you believe in the food, if you believe that it's

1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:34.160
 going to do good things for you, if you allocate it the right way, it's going to have a positive

1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:39.200
 impact. And I try and do that no matter what it is. Like I have my foods that I think do certain

1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:48.160
 things. And so, you know, for me, I know that actually, I mean, I learned about corn fed pumps

1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:55.840
 when I was overseas. I realized that if I, I never used to eat crap, really didn't. I ate

1:36:55.840 --> 1:37:06.640
 super clean all the time. And when I was faced with imminent death more, I would be like, okay,

1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:12.320
 I'm going out tonight. Let's have a couple ice cream bars. You know, like whatever. And

1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:21.440
 what I realized is if I eat like an entire bag of chips or like, you know, a bunch of chocolate bars,

1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:28.320
 and then I go and have a workout, my workout will be incredible. It'll be incredible.

1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:37.840
 There's something about easily processed carbohydrates that will continue to quickly

1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:45.680
 get into your blood as fast as you can burn it. And there's something about that that

1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:53.920
 will give you incredible blood, blood flow. Yeah. And also your mind plugging in, enjoying that.

1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:58.480
 Right. And then believing it works. And that's how it works. It worked better.

1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:04.560
 Exactly. I mean, I feel that way. I think this is really not, this has been frustrating to me

1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:10.480
 about the health culture in the United States in the studies that are done. You know, you look at

1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:16.960
 like the importance of sleep, the importance of x diet, all those kinds of things. I wish

1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:22.560
 incorporated into that would be your mental relationship with all these things. So for

1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:30.480
 example, people that tell me, well, your sleep schedule is insane. Yes, perhaps, but also it's

1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:34.960
 insane because I'm doing what I love and I don't see it as a problem. Right. And I,

1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:42.720
 I think that's really important to understand if, if you, if you're, if you sleeping crazy hours

1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:50.080
 is not affecting your stress and is actually making you happy or you're drawing some kind

1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:55.280
 of source of happiness and pleasure and satisfaction, like being awake when others aren't, it's like the

1:38:55.840 --> 1:39:01.040
 Mike Tyson thing or something, like training when you've convinced yourself everybody's sleeping

1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:06.240
 and therefore you're somehow training much better. Right. That's powerful. Even if you look

1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:12.240
 statistically six hours, maybe worse than eight hours or four hours, maybe worse than six hours.

1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:18.000
 So the mind is a powerful thing. Super powerful. But if you want to be a super heavyweight,

1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:25.200
 eat, you got to eat like stupid amounts all the time. Yeah. You have to test your digestive system.

1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:27.840
 What's your favorite meal, by the way, just if you have to, you know,

1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:36.480
 you know, I am, I do, oh, geez, I like so much food. It's tough. But I'd say the food that I

1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:42.320
 rely on a lot when I'm getting ready to compete is sushi just because it normally comes in an

1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:48.960
 all you can eat format. You know, so, you know, I love to go and just binge all you can eat.

1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:54.800
 Just all you can eat buffets. Sushi is just super convenient. Yeah. If I was a sushi,

1:39:54.800 --> 1:40:00.240
 all you can eat buffet place, I'd be terrified when I saw you. Have you had barbecue at Texas?

1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:08.000
 Yeah, I love it. I love it. Yeah. So you, just a small tangent on this, you faced the mountain

1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:13.440
 you have for, well, first of all, you arm wrestle them. It's interesting to ask,

1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:19.520
 so this is the mountain from the Game of Thrones. A strong man, one of the strongest people in the

1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:24.400
 world for time, the strongest person in the world. What was it like? I know, sort of,

1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:30.080
 you guys maybe weren't going 1000%, but what's it like? Well, he probably wasn't going 1000%.

1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:36.960
 But like what, it's interesting to think, what does that strength feel like? So

1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:46.000
 it's a specialized strength in another sport. What did it feel like? What, how strong was he,

1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:53.120
 what is some kind of deep insights he drawn from that battle? I feel like if we were to go back

1:40:53.120 --> 1:41:03.040
 a 1000 years and if you give him armor and a two handed sword, he will just rip across the

1:41:03.040 --> 1:41:09.360
 landscape and no one will stop him. So this is a boxing match you can do, but there's also a video

1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:17.360
 of them arm wrestling. Yeah, what a Titan though. What a Titan. You know, a guy like that, tall,

1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:25.520
 yeah, strong, fit, disciplined. I mean, he is, he's quite a warrior. 419 pounds.

1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:33.280
 Oh, yeah, yeah. He's, he's incredibly impressive. I really like Hapthor and I like Eddie Hall too.

1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:41.840
 And I was just so, I'm just so caught up with the drama. Okay, so, so Eddie Hall and Hapthor

1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:48.640
 Bjornsson, two of the strongest legendary strongmen that we have at, you know, and they were the

1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:55.680
 coolest, they were the top when strongman was really super cool. I don't know all the details,

1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:03.040
 but they legit hit each other. Like legit. So I think it kind of stems, I don't know, like,

1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:11.200
 like I say, I'm not right there with them, but Eddie won the world's strongest man event

1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:17.600
 or something one year. And like, and the thing is, one of those victories where Hapthor, you know,

1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:22.320
 was not accepting of his defeat. Okay, and there was a little bit of back and forth. And basically,

1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:26.080
 from what I understand, they were going to fight like the night of the world's strongest man.

1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:33.600
 And they got kind of got pulled apart and this, this heat between them got translated into a

1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:39.440
 potential boxing match. So it's very real. It's a very real fight. So you have the two

1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:45.200
 strongest dudes on the planet. Again, a fight each other. So, so I've been like, you know,

1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:50.240
 because arm wrestling is strong, man, it's kind of similar communities. Who do you got?

1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:57.600
 If you're giving me financial advice? Oh, Jesus, I am so bad. I always call it wrong.

1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:04.880
 They're very different. I see Hapthor as being, you know, more Eddie Hall slimming down. Is that

1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:12.240
 what you think as well? I see Hapthor is a bit more regimented. But I see Eddie Hall as like

1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:19.520
 way more barbaric and like, I think he's a little bit more athletic. But Hapthor is bigger. And,

1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:25.920
 you know, they've chosen slightly different paths to prepare for the match. But what happened was

1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:32.640
 like they were about to fight. And Eddie, Eddie Hall blew his bicep. So me, I was getting ready

1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:37.840
 for Levan in December. We were supposed to arm wrestle in December, but he's got his movie.

1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:42.800
 And so I was like, okay, I can kind of get away from the sport just a little bit, broaden my base.

1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:49.600
 That happened. And I was like, Oh, an opportunity. You stepped in. An opportunity to fight. I'm like,

1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:55.600
 I'll do it. So how much training you, you trained a little bit. So can you tell about your own

1:43:55.600 --> 1:43:59.440
 decision to do that? What was the training like? What was the experience like? Oh, it was so much

1:43:59.440 --> 1:44:07.520
 fun. It was so much fun. So basically, I made a funny video and I sent it to the organizers of

1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:12.640
 core sports that I would do it. I'm like, I'll do it. I'm sure they got 1000 people who wanted to

1:44:12.640 --> 1:44:18.800
 do it. But I'm like, I'm like, listen, I'm like, I'm an old man, like I'm gimped up like everywhere

1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:25.520
 outside the arm wrestling lanes. I said, but I will 100%. Like if you let me fight him, I'll give it

1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:31.040
 to my all. And, and whatever, they didn't get back to me. They're like, yeah, whatever. Okay. So then,

1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:38.080
 so then they call me on a Friday, like five weeks before the event. And they're like, Hey,

1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:47.440
 Devin, were you serious? And I'm like, Oh, shit. And I'm like, Yes, I was serious. Yeah, I'll do it.

1:44:47.440 --> 1:44:55.040
 And they're like, okay. They're like, it's down to you and like two other people will get back to

1:44:55.040 --> 1:44:59.200
 you in a day or two. But you would do it. And I'm like, Okay, so they got back to me on Sunday.

1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:06.800
 Like, so right away, I'm like skipping rope. And I'm like, and I'm, I only arm wrestling. That's

1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:13.600
 all I do. So what was your, you did some striking training? Yeah. So I went to this guy that he

1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:19.840
 was, he was awesome. Zach Ben Bousheda there. That was it from, from TriStar. Do you know,

1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:25.520
 for us the hobby? And yes, people in the comments, I will interview him on this podcast.

1:45:26.560 --> 1:45:31.600
 He's brilliant. Yes. Right. He's an incredible guy. So right away, like I had no idea about the

1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:37.760
 fight community across Canada, really. And I got like, by the fifth message that said,

1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:43.280
 you must train with for us. I was like, Okay, called him up. He was incredible right away.

1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:48.960
 He's like, Yeah, you can come and we'll just work with you. So I got, I got the call, I called him

1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:55.200
 on like Monday at two o clock. By like seven o clock, I had my things packed. And I went to

1:45:55.200 --> 1:46:02.720
 Montreal. And I spent four weeks in the fighter dorms. Just humbling yourself. Yeah. Every day,

1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:10.320
 just getting punched in the face, you know, over and over, going for runs with all like,

1:46:10.320 --> 1:46:14.480
 they're all like Olympians and pro fighters living in the dorms. Super cool dudes. They were so good

1:46:14.480 --> 1:46:20.320
 to me. Yeah, there's a good video of you. And for us, just talking. Yeah, I don't remember

1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:26.560
 which stage this was, but this early, but you're already beginning to get humbled. Oh, I knew.

1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:31.440
 I mean, I knew what I was getting into. Like I knew it was, I knew it was going to be a losing

1:46:31.440 --> 1:46:38.560
 battle. But I felt like the opportunity to fight Thor, like how cool is that? Like I had, I had

1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:47.920
 to say, I had to do it. I love the process. And I learned a lot from doing it. Like the dorms,

1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:51.120
 I want to do something like that was arm wrestling. I think we're big enough now

1:46:51.120 --> 1:46:56.880
 that we can have these kind of, you know, dorms, frat houses, whatever you want to call it.

1:46:56.880 --> 1:47:01.040
 What's the dorm like? So you basically stay in there. Yeah, food is there. Yeah. So you can,

1:47:01.040 --> 1:47:06.080
 you can, you mentioned, what was the word you use? Administration. Yeah, exactly. That's it.

1:47:06.080 --> 1:47:10.400
 So it removes all of that. Makes it so simple. You can just focus. You know, the gym is here,

1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:17.360
 you live here. Yeah. You know, but your life becomes simple. Yeah. So there's a guy named

1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:22.160
 Jimmy Pedro here in America. He's a famous coach. There's a place up in Boston. He has kind of a

1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:29.120
 dorm like that too. Yeah. And that becomes essential when the community is small, but you're

1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:34.560
 trying to do epic things like winning an Olympic gold. Yeah. So you have to really put the people

1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:39.840
 together in these kind of minimalist conditions when they just focus on the training, focus, focus,

1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:46.320
 focus. Yes. Yeah. It wasn't enough time. I mean, I trained for about three or four weeks.

1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:53.040
 But I love the journey. And what are some of the fun things you enjoy? So you did mostly striking,

1:47:53.040 --> 1:47:58.000
 did you? Yeah, I guess it was. Yeah, it was boxing. It was straight up boxing. Yeah. Well,

1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:01.600
 what are some things that were transferable? What are some cool things you learned from that?

1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:07.600
 So from the world of arm wrestling, have you taken anything back? Like some training regiments,

1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:16.320
 ideas about training, even just even movements? Because for us, it's a unique mind as well for

1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:25.680
 training. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I've gone very far down the path of arm wrestling. Boxing

1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:33.920
 and arm wrestling are very different. They're very different sports. The physicality required

1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:40.240
 is very different. The mentality, I mean, it's fighting. So it's another form of fighting,

1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:46.640
 which is cool. The big things that I took back from it, the things that I loved about it was,

1:48:46.640 --> 1:48:54.000
 I had to run again. So really work on endurance. Yeah. I was going for runs with guys in the

1:48:54.000 --> 1:49:06.240
 dorms and they would just destroy me. It was so bad. How did you feel in the actual boxing in

1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:14.560
 terms of endurance? Were you able to? No. It's a torture. It was terrible. And the thing is,

1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:21.440
 it was so crazy for me because I really was good once upon a time. I really was. Physically,

1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:30.240
 I had incredible full body endurance. But being so specialized, I realized how much I had slipped.

1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:36.960
 And yeah, it was fun to try and regain. I think it's affected my body composition.

1:49:36.960 --> 1:49:42.400
 I think since that training, I've become much more lean. I think it was a very healthy thing for

1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:48.080
 me to do health wise. I always think that when you're far away from competition, it's really

1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:53.520
 good to spread out really good. So I think that in that way. Also for your mind too. Yeah.

1:49:53.520 --> 1:50:03.920
 Just like, yeah. Yeah. So something about clearing your... I think you've talked about this. You're

1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:09.680
 basically taking steps back before you take steps forward. I forget how you call it. Yeah. The wave.

1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:16.880
 Yeah. Under, you have to go under. You got to. If you want to go above the line, you have to spend

1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:22.960
 some time beneath it. And yeah, I was definitely beneath the line for a long time. Yeah. But

1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:33.280
 mountain, I mean, the interesting thing was as incredible as he is. What a monster. And I think

1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:41.760
 if you had had him training and boxing for a long time and from his youth, I think I could be world

1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:49.120
 champion. But to be so specialized and then to switch, you're at a disadvantage. Yeah. And also,

1:50:49.920 --> 1:50:56.800
 I know from just fighting guys in the gym and TriStar, some of those guys were way scarier

1:50:57.760 --> 1:51:05.040
 for real. Like as scary as Thor is, there's guys in that TriStar gym that don't look like anything

1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:12.480
 that would murder me much worse, much worse. Yeah. But also, you know, that's the difference

1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:17.520
 between being in the gym and under the lights too. I mean, GSB is an example of George St.

1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:22.880
 Pierre is an example of somebody that maybe doesn't look terrifying. He says TriStar. Yep.

1:51:22.880 --> 1:51:31.120
 He trains at TriStar, but he's super nice, super humble, but is terrifying when he's fighting.

1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:38.960
 Right. Is dominating people. You mentioned death. Yeah. And your Canadian special forces

1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:44.560
 and in general, thinking about mortality. Yeah. Do you think about your death? Do you

1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:53.280
 contemplate the end that this thing, that this ride ends? All the time. Yeah. From I've thought

1:51:53.280 --> 1:51:59.200
 about death from a young age. Are you afraid of it? Yeah, I hate it. Yeah, I don't want to die.

1:51:59.200 --> 1:52:05.280
 Yeah, definitely, definitely don't want to die. But there's times when I can rid myself of it.

1:52:05.280 --> 1:52:14.640
 Yeah. But for sure, I mean, I'm not happy that, you know, death is inevitable. And I'm not happy

1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:24.080
 that potentially it's inevitable for all of us. But it does, you know, I like to fight against it.

1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:29.840
 If you could be immortal, would you choose to? Oh, that's my only wish.

1:52:30.640 --> 1:52:36.720
 Oh, see, but here's the thing. But the point is to have that wish. It's like the all you can

1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:45.120
 eat buffet at sushi. That sushi is more delicious if you have a limit. Do you have its own? Well,

1:52:45.840 --> 1:52:51.520
 I don't know. I mean, I don't think I get sick of stuff. I'm very simple. Yeah, I don't think I

1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:56.480
 would get tired of it. I really don't. I mean, if someone would pose it to you, do you want to

1:52:56.480 --> 1:53:02.720
 live forever? You would choose no? Yeah, I would choose no. Choose no. Well, my answer is probably yes.

1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:12.160
 Like, no, I would, it's more like the snooze button. Do you want to go to sleep?

1:53:13.760 --> 1:53:19.840
 But it's very difficult in the moment to go to sleep. But if I'm allowed to live forever,

1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:29.920
 I'm going to delay all the crazy, like, all the ambitious goals, all the, all the things,

1:53:29.920 --> 1:53:33.200
 because, oh, there's always time. That's fine. But there is tomorrow then.

1:53:33.200 --> 1:53:37.920
 But there is tomorrow. But see, I think that takes away from the richness of, like,

1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:45.040
 the richness of the lived experience of just each moment. I think the richness of each moment

1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:51.280
 comes from saying, like, I could die tonight. Like that, it tastes delicious because you're

1:53:51.280 --> 1:53:56.560
 going to die. I'm afraid if you're not, I'm afraid all that goes away. All that magic

1:53:56.560 --> 1:54:03.680
 goes away if you can live forever. I don't know. But I'll tell you, every time I have

1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:07.680
 a near death experience or think I'm going to die, I definitely live better afterwards.

1:54:07.680 --> 1:54:15.360
 Yeah. Like, it's always been that way. But yeah, no. That's why the Stoics,

1:54:15.360 --> 1:54:21.120
 you know, they really preach contemplating immortality often. It kind of reminds you,

1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:25.040
 it get this whole thing could just end any moment and it makes you really appreciate.

1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:33.440
 Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Certainly improving the quality of life is important.

1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:42.560
 But part of me thinks that immortality is not as fun as we would like to imagine.

1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:49.440
 Do you think that maybe you're, in what you're building potentially, is immortal?

1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:58.240
 Well, that's what I definitely think about with robots. If they were to have a human

1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:04.000
 like experience and be able to interact with humans in a deep meaningful way, I think they

1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:09.680
 too have to be mortal in some fundamental way that means mortal. Like their ride has to end

1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:16.640
 as well because they won't be able to interact with humans deeply unless that's the case.

1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:28.400
 Like to have fear, to have love, the ability to suffer, the ability to miss somebody,

1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:37.200
 I think scarcity is important. You have to be able to truly lose somebody. You have to be,

1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:44.320
 to fear things. You have to truly have the risk of destroying yourself and to have a sense of

1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:52.960
 what it means to be a self. You have to be able to lose it. So if you're immortal, you're just

1:55:52.960 --> 1:56:00.640
 going to be, I feel like you're going to be like a toaster, an intelligent toaster that just serves.

1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:03.920
 Such a negative perspective on it. On immortality?

1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:08.320
 Yeah. Just think, well, now you can get all those things done that you want to do.

1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:10.560
 I hope you're right. I hope you're right.

1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:14.880
 Yeah. I mean, potentially you could invest even harder because you're like, wow,

1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:17.440
 I'm actually going to be able to get all this stuff done.

1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:25.120
 I think about this a lot. I hope you're right, but I fear that the drive to create,

1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:30.800
 I can even do more, all of that dissipates, disappears if you have all the time in the

1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:36.160
 world. I just know how lazy I am. And if I have all the time in the world, I'm just going to sit

1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:43.120
 there and just watch the stupidest YouTube videos for the rest of all eternity.

1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:50.320
 Now, eternity is a long time. Eat Doritos and Cheetos and just get fatter and fatter.

1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:55.600
 I can get in shape later. There's always time. That's like a long period of contemplation.

1:56:56.160 --> 1:57:02.240
 Yeah. So for the first thousand years, it'll be the Dorito period of the Lex life.

1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:06.480
 Yeah. You could be like Job of the Hut for a thousand years.

1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:11.600
 You mentioned aliens. Very important topic. Do you actually think about this has been an

1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:19.120
 increased interest? It has been increased UFO sightings and encounters, all that kind of stuff.

1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:27.920
 The U.S. government at least releasing data, releasing videos of pilots, pilot observations

1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:32.880
 and from airplanes of UFOs. Do you think about this kind of stuff? Because you mentioned in

1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:38.240
 the following context, you mentioned like, our humans will get our shit together when the aliens

1:57:38.240 --> 1:57:44.800
 eventually come. Yeah. What do you make of all the sightings? Is that something you think about?

1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:50.800
 I thought about it a lot when I was younger. And I've just, I made my conclusions. And

1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:55.920
 yeah, I don't think that there's a possibility that there aren't aliens. I would think there

1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:03.040
 would be impossible for there not to be aliens. They're, I feel like this is pretty good real

1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:10.320
 estate. So you probably want it, but we already might be, well, I don't even think might. I mean,

1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:15.520
 it's probably quite likely that we are to some degree aliens. I mean, all life is probably

1:58:15.520 --> 1:58:20.160
 to some degree alien. I like the real estate, so the resources, but we're also kind of interesting.

1:58:21.200 --> 1:58:25.520
 Whatever this ant colony of living organisms that we've created, it's kind of interesting

1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:32.080
 to study. I tend to believe that the alien civilizations that are going to reach us or

1:58:32.080 --> 1:58:39.040
 have reached us are far more intelligent, just orders of magnitude more intelligent than us.

1:58:39.040 --> 1:58:43.680
 And so it's going to be very difficult both ways, actually, for us to understand them and for them

1:58:44.560 --> 1:58:50.160
 to dumb themselves down enough to understand us. Yeah, probably. So they might even just

1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:56.320
 miss our existence altogether, just because I tend to believe, I don't know what you think,

1:58:56.320 --> 1:59:02.560
 that we're not that special in terms of all the life forms in the universe. There's a lot of

1:59:02.560 --> 1:59:08.240
 cool stuff out there. And that has to be. It has to be. But to us, we're special. Yeah. Well,

1:59:08.240 --> 1:59:13.840
 that's all that matters, right? Yeah. Even the human species is the most special to us humans.

1:59:13.840 --> 1:59:19.520
 There could be much more special species here on earth. They were just totally oblivious to

1:59:19.520 --> 1:59:25.280
 like trees, on the scale of thousands of years, maybe they're like, they're onto something.

1:59:26.560 --> 1:59:35.920
 Lex, you know, I think that so much of what makes a person special is what they pass on

1:59:35.920 --> 1:59:42.480
 your kids. But, but I think that you are quite special, because you're part of this thing that's

1:59:42.480 --> 1:59:50.400
 potentially giving birth to the next thing. The robots. The robots. I should say the funny thing

1:59:50.400 --> 1:59:56.880
 is while talking to Devin during this podcast, I had with a doorbell ring at the good on stairs,

1:59:57.440 --> 2:00:07.120
 and there was a big box, medicine box with a new legged robot. So the hilarity of you saying that

2:00:07.120 --> 2:00:13.600
 is because that robot is actually going to likely be the main robot that I showed to the world

2:00:14.480 --> 2:00:20.320
 in the coming months, because that has the, that's the highest compute level in that robot. So

2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:29.760
 I've been playing a lot with legged robots, the four legs, like a dog. I like all the robots.

2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:34.480
 But there's something about when a robot has legs, it's able to communicate,

2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:39.280
 it's able to connect with humans in some kind of deep way in the way a dog can,

2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:45.120
 just show affection, something about like step, step, step, step. And then, and then the robot

2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:50.480
 realizes you're here and then it steps and then notices you in the way the dog does and raises

2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:59.600
 its head. It makes me feel noticed and heard in the same way I do when a dog notices me,

2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:05.840
 that excitement, that stupid excitement of like, yes, a fellow living organism. And

2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:13.360
 what excites me about legged robots is that, holy shit, it's possible to engineer this. It's

2:01:13.360 --> 2:01:18.160
 possible to create that feeling. And I wonder where that can go. There's a lot of negative

2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:24.400
 possible trajectories, but I have a sense that there's positive ones too. You think that they'll

2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:33.680
 take us with them? Yeah, I think so because I, so there's this fear of robots that they become

2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:39.280
 super intelligent and run away from us humans and basically become so intelligent and then they

2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:47.520
 almost just not giving a damn will destroy us. But I think in order for robots to become

2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:55.600
 intelligent, they have to integrate themselves with society. So they buy the very nature of how

2:01:55.600 --> 2:02:02.560
 they become intelligent, have to bring us along. So it's not that there'll be this separate thing.

2:02:02.560 --> 2:02:08.080
 They have to like, we'll have robots in the home, will they'll be interacting with us? You have

2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:12.880
 human kids, and you have a bunch of robots, you have robot friends, you have human friends,

2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:18.000
 and the robots make your human to human relationships much more meaningful and richer.

2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:23.280
 They bring more love to the world, but it's integrated. It's not like they'll be developing

2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:32.240
 smarter and smarter as sentient beings by themselves. I think that's very difficult to do.

2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:36.560
 You have to be doing that together with humans. And so we'll come for the ride. There's technical

2:02:36.560 --> 2:02:43.280
 things like we might merge like cyborgs more and more. We already saw our cyborgs, right?

2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:50.160
 With the phones and so on, but more and more. So with Elon and Neuralink, deeper integration of

2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:57.840
 robots and AI into increasing the bandwidth at which they can communicate. So if we do implants

2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:06.960
 in the brain, I think, again, a lot of people are really nervous about this, as am I, but I think

2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:12.640
 there's a lot of trajectories that are positive there. That to me is exciting. And also, I just

2:03:12.640 --> 2:03:19.200
 don't think it's possible to stop this development. So we should steer it. Yeah. Yeah.

2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:23.600
 For good. Did you, I mean, you must have watched the movie Terminator, right?

2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:27.840
 Yeah, of course. I love Terminator. I love Schwarzenegger. My favorite movie of all time.

2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:31.840
 I mean, that's the big fear, right?

2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:38.640
 Yeah. What's the conclusion with Terminator? Isn't ultimately humanity wins?

2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:42.640
 I think they're at like Terminator 8 now. Yeah. I don't know.

2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:50.080
 Yeah. So it's interesting, actually, I was going to bring this up as you were talking about it,

2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:57.520
 but China and the United States actually don't know where Canada is on this, but they both have

2:03:57.520 --> 2:04:04.640
 agreed that they're not going to put limits on autonomous weapon system development. They're

2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:09.520
 not going to. They're not going to. So because China said we're not going to and now US officially

2:04:09.520 --> 2:04:17.280
 announced that we're not, we can't. Well, you can't. It's like, you never could, right? As soon as

2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:25.360
 it exists and it's better, people will use it. Well, but there's been a global ban on bio weapons.

2:04:26.480 --> 2:04:31.040
 So you were able to come to an agreement there that we're not going to use biological weapons

2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:40.160
 in war. So a lot of people are really upset that in the case of AI driven weapons, the world said,

2:04:40.160 --> 2:04:47.440
 nope, that's okay. And so now you have this potential for greater and greater automation

2:04:47.440 --> 2:04:54.400
 in drones, for example, in picking bombing locations and so the area at which they attack.

2:04:54.400 --> 2:05:01.440
 And so you get some of that stuff that you mentioned that drew you to the military

2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:08.800
 is that teamwork between humans, that decision making. So there's strategy, but built into that

2:05:08.800 --> 2:05:18.800
 team is a deep humanity. Even when there's an enemy, there's lines that you are aware of,

2:05:18.800 --> 2:05:25.600
 of what is ethical, what is not, what is just and what is not. And it's so easy for a machine

2:05:26.960 --> 2:05:34.880
 to miss all of that, plow through it and do deeply inhumane acts, commit atrocities. That's

2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:46.240
 something that worries a lot of people. Because yeah, an AI based war is terrifying, especially

2:05:46.240 --> 2:05:50.320
 with cyber security, which is becoming more and more of an issue, which is hacking.

2:05:53.760 --> 2:06:00.880
 People that look a lot like me, being the warriors of the future, which is meaning people

2:06:00.880 --> 2:06:09.200
 behind a keyboard versus the traditional warriors. Probably inevitable.

2:06:11.040 --> 2:06:17.920
 Yeah. And terrifying. It is. It is. But I think if you believe that it's possible,

2:06:17.920 --> 2:06:23.360
 it's certainly going to happen. Like at some point, it's just when, right? When does it happen?

2:06:24.240 --> 2:06:29.520
 So that, I mean, to me, I'm ultimately optimistic about the future. And to me,

2:06:29.520 --> 2:06:35.440
 I'm excited about the world with AI. I'm even excited about the metaverse and all these kinds

2:06:35.440 --> 2:06:42.240
 of things, living more and more in the digital space in the virtual reality. I think, so it's

2:06:42.240 --> 2:06:47.440
 a part of me that grew up in the non internet world, non computer world. It says, oh, kids,

2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:56.400
 these days with the video games, there's part of me that's like that. But I think technology at

2:06:56.400 --> 2:07:03.040
 its best can bring out the best of humanity. And so I think virtual reality, all of these things

2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:09.440
 over time will figure out how to, how to fix it to bring out the humanity. Social networks,

2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:14.160
 the first generation social networks, now Facebook, Twitter and so on, they have so many

2:07:14.160 --> 2:07:18.480
 problems. They're bringing out the worst in people. But I think we're learning from that.

2:07:18.480 --> 2:07:22.320
 And I think the next generation of social networks will be better and better and better.

2:07:22.320 --> 2:07:30.880
 And so I'm optimistic. But of course, one reason we may have not seen aliens yet,

2:07:30.880 --> 2:07:37.200
 obviously, like in a way that's obvious, is because once you get clever and smart and have

2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:42.880
 all this cool technology, you destroy yourself. And we sure as humans are pretty close to that.

2:07:42.880 --> 2:07:46.800
 Yeah. Yeah, there might be that limit that is hard to get right.

2:07:46.800 --> 2:07:50.720
 I'm hoping we get all our aggression between nations out through arm wrestling.

2:07:50.720 --> 2:07:57.920
 Right? Yeah. Oh my God. Wouldn't that be great if it was that simple?

2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:02.080
 Yeah. Do you know if there's another over the top type movie to be made?

2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:06.240
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's always stuff in the works. There's actually a, there's a,

2:08:06.240 --> 2:08:10.000
 there's a tournament called Over the Top in Australia that's a couple of months away. I think

2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:14.720
 they're doing all the over top scene. But there are arm wrestling movies that are being made right

2:08:14.720 --> 2:08:21.040
 now. Actually, there's a documentary that's filming me for this Olavon thing. But yeah,

2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:26.160
 we're probably due for another big one. Yeah. But you're also just with your YouTube channel,

2:08:26.160 --> 2:08:29.360
 you're doing a lot for the sport. That's really cool to see. Just being genuine,

2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:34.400
 but just being like, looking not like you're looking today, but just like...

2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:35.200
 Yeah. Yeah.

2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:36.880
 Just the beard. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:42.720
 Just like sleepy, you know, and just putting yourself out there completely as you are.

2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:46.880
 That's a beautiful thing. The best thing about the sport is it brings people together.

2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:51.760
 That's it. Yeah. The community, the folks I got to interact with just so awesome,

2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:58.000
 so excited, so full of kindness. I'm definitely going to find the club here and start working on my

2:09:00.480 --> 2:09:07.040
 arm wrestling game. Devon, this is such a huge honor that you would spend your valuable time.

2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:14.080
 You would come down to Austin, you would hang out with me and do this conversation.

2:09:14.080 --> 2:09:21.040
 Super cool. As I mentioned, in case people, you know, people I'm sure will tell me. So,

2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:25.920
 I hang out with Joe Rogan all the time. He's a friend. I told him that he should talk to Devon.

2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:31.120
 He's going through some stuff currently, you know, but I'm sure that I hope the conversation

2:09:31.120 --> 2:09:37.360
 between you, Devon and Joe happens eventually. He's, that would be epic as well because he's a,

2:09:38.640 --> 2:09:42.640
 he loves fighting. He loves fighting. He loves wrestling. He loves strength.

2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:50.880
 And I think all of those are like so perfectly encapsulated in the sport of arm wrestling.

2:09:50.880 --> 2:09:53.440
 So, thank you so much for talking to me. Thanks so much, Lex.

2:09:55.680 --> 2:09:59.840
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Devon Larritt. To support this podcast,

 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you some words from Miyamoto

2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:13.760
 Musashi. The only reason a warrior is alive is to fight. And the only reason a warrior fights

2:10:13.760 --> 2:10:30.800
 is to win. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
