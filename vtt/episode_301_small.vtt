00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
 Something happened where they forced my hand and it's the only time that the Soviet

00:06.800 --> 00:12.080
 agent was anywhere near me on the territory of the United States.

00:12.080 --> 00:20.200
 So I'm waiting for the A train on a dark morning still in Queens and there's this man

00:20.200 --> 00:27.120
 in a black trench coat comes up to me from my right and he whispers into my ears, you

00:27.120 --> 00:32.280
 gotta come back or else you're dead.

00:32.280 --> 00:37.680
 The following is a conversation with Jack Barski, a former KGB spy, author of Deep Under

00:37.680 --> 00:43.480
 Cover and the subject of an excellent podcast series called The Agent.

00:43.480 --> 00:49.120
 There are very few people who have defected from the KGB and live to tell the story.

00:49.120 --> 00:54.280
 It is one of the most powerful intelligence organizations in history and this conversation

00:54.280 --> 01:01.320
 gives a window into its operation both from an ideological and psychological perspective.

01:01.320 --> 01:08.320
 But also it tells the story of a man who lived one heck of an incredible life.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.360
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast.

01:10.360 --> 01:15.520
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends, here's

01:15.520 --> 01:18.240
 Jack Barski.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.520
 Let's start with a big basic question.

01:20.520 --> 01:22.520
 What is the KGB?

01:22.520 --> 01:37.280
 It's the State Security Committee, this is a threat, and BS means without, and I guess

01:37.280 --> 01:41.400
 that directly translates to security without threat.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.600
 And don't exist anymore.

01:43.600 --> 01:49.960
 It was disbanded when the Soviet Union fell apart and the successor agencies are now the

01:49.960 --> 01:52.800
 SVR and the FSB.

01:52.800 --> 02:01.040
 FSB supposedly the equivalent to the FBI and SVR, the CIA, but the SVR is relatively weak

02:01.040 --> 02:08.080
 and the FSB has taken on a lot of espionage and active measures and they're much bigger

02:08.080 --> 02:16.720
 and stronger, but the most capable intelligence agency in Russia is the GRU, military intelligence.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.520
 Then nobody knows very much about it.

02:18.520 --> 02:19.520
 That's right.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.360
 When I was in the KGB, I had no idea that there was military intelligence.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.560
 Nobody ever mentioned anything like that.

02:25.560 --> 02:31.720
 And by the way, I recently had the pleasure to give a talk at the DIA.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.120
 When they reached out to me, I didn't know they existed either.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.120
 Interesting.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.560
 Yeah, that's always the question.

02:37.560 --> 02:42.760
 If you want to be an intelligence agency, should the world know anything about you?

02:42.760 --> 02:48.720
 Because in some sense, you want to create the legend in order to attract great competent

02:48.720 --> 02:54.320
 individuals to work for you, but at the same time, you want it to be shrouded in complete

02:54.320 --> 02:55.320
 mystery.

02:55.320 --> 03:01.840
 If nobody knows you exist, you might be able to operate well as an intelligence agency.

03:01.840 --> 03:11.000
 That is fascinating, but FSB is the thing that carries the flag of KGB, KGB being probably

03:11.000 --> 03:18.560
 one of, if not the most infamous, famous, infamous, and powerful intelligence agencies

03:18.560 --> 03:19.560
 ever.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.560
 In history, yes.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.560
 Ever.

03:21.560 --> 03:22.560
 Absolutely, 100%.

03:22.560 --> 03:26.320
 It was founded in 1954 after the death of Stalin.

03:26.320 --> 03:31.120
 You've, in writing your book, looked back at the predecessors of the history.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.120
 Right.

03:32.120 --> 03:43.600
 The history in which the KGB is grounded in the culture, the spirit, the soul of its predecessors.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.760
 Oh, absolutely.

03:44.760 --> 03:50.520
 They just changed names and they changed personnel rather frequently.

03:50.520 --> 03:54.120
 I had something to do with Stalin's paranoia.

03:54.120 --> 04:00.560
 From between 1923, and I don't remember what, I think it may have been the NKVD at that

04:00.560 --> 04:10.560
 time, it started as a chica and then it became the GPU, the NKVD, yes.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.240
 But with those name changes, you also had changes at the top.

04:14.240 --> 04:23.800
 Between 1923 and 1953 when Stalin died, that is 30 years, they had eight heads of intelligence

04:23.800 --> 04:29.280
 and of those eight, six were executed when they were replaced.

04:29.280 --> 04:38.320
 So that's an indication that this was an organization that ate itself from the inside.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.560
 The Soviet Union was the only dictatorship in history that did not rest its powers on

04:42.560 --> 04:43.560
 the military.

04:43.560 --> 04:49.880
 They rested its powers on the intelligence apparatus and that thing was unstable.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.160
 So you know where that leads.

04:52.160 --> 04:58.120
 Eventually, if you rest your power on something that is made out of bricks that don't hold

04:58.120 --> 05:01.280
 a lot of load, it will fall apart.

05:01.280 --> 05:04.560
 On sand, why was it unstable, would you say?

05:04.560 --> 05:07.480
 What if human nature makes it unstable?

05:07.480 --> 05:09.280
 It's the paranoia.

05:09.280 --> 05:17.280
 Stalin was always worried about the most powerful people coming after him.

05:17.280 --> 05:23.200
 So he proactively killed off heads of the KGB and he had this great purge where he got

05:23.200 --> 05:31.720
 rid of a lot of his generals, really capable generals and that cost him dearly when World

05:31.720 --> 05:39.600
 War II started because he started off with a force that wasn't as capable as it could

05:39.600 --> 05:40.600
 have been.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.800
 Was it paranoid at all levels?

05:42.800 --> 05:45.160
 I believe so.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.640
 It comes from the top.

05:46.640 --> 05:55.440
 And so if the top doesn't trust you, you always have to worry about your peers snitching on

05:55.440 --> 05:58.200
 you.

05:58.200 --> 06:07.800
 And I think we have a very similar situation in Russia today and in this kind of atmosphere,

06:07.800 --> 06:10.280
 the truth will never get to the top.

06:10.280 --> 06:17.400
 So no matter what moral rules the organization operates under, trust is fundamental to its

06:17.400 --> 06:18.400
 competence.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.400
 Oh, absolutely.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.920
 And I want to extend this to my own existence.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.080
 And this is kind of strange.

06:26.080 --> 06:35.120
 It's almost dichotomous because I was running around lying to everybody and I couldn't fundamentally

06:35.120 --> 06:36.120
 be trusted.

06:36.120 --> 06:40.800
 But the relationship that I had with the KGB was based on trust.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.080
 If they don't trust me, they don't send me out.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.920
 And if I don't trust them, I'm not going.

06:45.920 --> 06:50.920
 And I eventually broke that trust and they knew there was always that danger.

06:50.920 --> 06:55.920
 They knew that because something about you or just something about human beings.

06:55.920 --> 07:05.040
 No, there were hints about how long my assignment would be, so 10 to 12 years.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.800
 And you see, it makes sense.

07:07.800 --> 07:13.360
 I was becoming an American and over time, I would become more and more American.

07:13.360 --> 07:19.280
 And there was always a chance that I liked it more here than there, that I was really

07:19.280 --> 07:22.680
 successful in what I was supposed to do.

07:22.680 --> 07:28.160
 And it sort of happened, but in my case, it happened because of my father, the child who

07:28.160 --> 07:30.880
 I didn't want to leave when they wanted me back.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.840
 Love always screws up.

07:32.840 --> 07:36.520
 Your employment competence, yes.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.000
 You absolutely right.

07:40.000 --> 07:48.640
 But they thought that I had an anchor at home because I had a wife and a son at home, which

07:48.640 --> 07:57.960
 you've got to worry about them if you defect because in the past, the KGB would go after

07:57.960 --> 08:01.440
 family ruthlessly.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.800
 Doing perhaps violence.

08:03.800 --> 08:08.280
 This is a hard question about the KGB because it's one of the most ruthless organizations,

08:08.280 --> 08:18.600
 but in general, are there lines, KGB agents at every level of the hierarchy that they

08:18.600 --> 08:25.240
 would not cross, political, legal, ethical, or does anything goes to achieve the goal?

08:25.240 --> 08:35.240
 I was only in touch with two types of agents, whether the technical experts, the ones that

08:35.240 --> 08:42.440
 taught me tradecraft, and they were like engineers and they were in charge of the secret writing

08:42.440 --> 08:53.000
 and the Morse code, shortwave, radio reception, decryption, encryption, and that kind of stuff.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.080
 These were just doing their job and the others, the ones that trained me, that prepared me

09:00.080 --> 09:05.320
 for life in the United States, they were nice people.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.320
 They were elegant people.

09:08.320 --> 09:19.040
 I don't think they would not fit into the stereotype of the ruthless gun carrying agent.

09:19.040 --> 09:24.640
 Is it possible that you would not be aware of the parts of the KGB?

09:24.640 --> 09:26.760
 It's very modular.

09:26.760 --> 09:32.120
 It's possible that you're not aware of the parts of the KGB that are the muscle?

09:32.120 --> 09:33.120
 I didn't know.

09:33.120 --> 09:39.840
 I would find out afterwards, after I retired and started doing some research, I had no

09:39.840 --> 09:40.840
 clue.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.720
 You're operating in a bubble?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.360
 Very much so.

09:44.360 --> 09:50.200
 This is what the KGB did really, really well, compartmentalization.

09:50.200 --> 09:57.200
 That was based on the communist movement while it was still underground.

09:57.200 --> 10:02.800
 The cells were very small so that maybe there were three, four members in one cell that

10:02.800 --> 10:07.720
 knew one another and then they had a liaison to another cell.

10:07.720 --> 10:14.440
 The bottom line is if one of those folks were caught, they could maybe betray four people

10:14.440 --> 10:20.840
 or three, something like that, and the KGB continued with that tradition.

10:20.840 --> 10:28.280
 I have reason to believe that my handler, the person in Moscow that directed me and made

10:28.280 --> 10:32.720
 decisions to do and where to go, never met me personally.

10:32.720 --> 10:37.280
 There's no reason to.

10:37.280 --> 10:45.320
 And this actually was a big advantage over other intelligence services because you look

10:45.320 --> 10:48.200
 at what the CIA does, everybody blabs.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.800
 There's a lot of leaks coming out of American intelligence.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.480
 I don't think there's as many leaks coming out of the Mossad.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.720
 Strong words from Jack Barski, by the way.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.920
 That is a question I want to ask a little more systematically.

10:59.920 --> 11:05.560
 Is there something unique about the KGB compared to the other intelligence agencies?

11:05.560 --> 11:11.880
 Let's talk British intelligence, MI6, Mossad, CIA.

11:11.880 --> 11:17.160
 Is there unique cultures, spirits, souls of the different organizations that maybe somehow

11:17.160 --> 11:22.760
 connect to the structures of government, connect maybe the values of the people, those kinds

11:22.760 --> 11:23.760
 of things?

11:23.760 --> 11:30.520
 I believe we were all pretty much strong believers in communism in the future of the

11:30.520 --> 11:31.520
 world being.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.520
 In KGB.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.520
 Yes.

11:33.520 --> 11:37.440
 And that unified us to a large degree, even the technicians.

11:37.440 --> 11:46.600
 So even it wasn't something like, yeah, yeah, the parents believe this thing, but we know

11:46.600 --> 11:47.600
 the truth.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.720
 You really believe the story of communism.

11:49.720 --> 11:50.720
 Absolutely did.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.320
 And you need to look at the timeframe.

11:54.320 --> 12:02.000
 The Soviet Union after World War II made quite a bit of progress in influencing the

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
 third world.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.320
 And I still remember when I was in middle school, we had a map, the map of the world,

12:09.320 --> 12:11.200
 and it was color coded.

12:11.200 --> 12:16.240
 So red was communism, that was the Soviet Union and the Eastern states.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.360
 And then blue was capitalism.

12:18.360 --> 12:22.440
 And then we had green, which were the third world countries.

12:22.440 --> 12:28.040
 And the green slowly turned pink because a lot of third world governments, like I'm looking

12:28.040 --> 12:38.440
 at Angola, I'm looking at Vietnam, a lot of these countries were very sympathetic to

12:38.440 --> 12:40.160
 the Soviet Union.

12:40.160 --> 12:44.560
 And so we sort of knew that this would go on like that.

12:44.560 --> 12:53.640
 And eventually we would take over and pretty much overtake, that was the myth, overtake

12:53.640 --> 13:00.560
 the United States, not only militarily, but also in terms of industrial production and

13:00.560 --> 13:01.560
 so forth.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.840
 Now that was a stupid pipe dream.

13:03.840 --> 13:08.200
 The military, it was a standoff, as we know.

13:08.200 --> 13:19.040
 Well, stupid pipe dream, Hitler had a stupid pipe dream that he executed it exceptionally

13:19.040 --> 13:27.560
 effectively and on, if not for a handful of military mistakes, a world could look very

13:27.560 --> 13:28.560
 different today.

13:28.560 --> 13:34.440
 Well, the biggest one being invading the Soviet Union, particularly at the time that he did

13:34.440 --> 13:40.440
 it because he ran into the same thing that Napoleon ran into, General Winter.

13:40.440 --> 13:49.520
 Well, Operation Barbarossa, within that, he could have made different decisions.

13:49.520 --> 13:56.600
 For example, skipping Kiev and attacking Moscow directly overthrowing the government.

13:56.600 --> 14:03.880
 So marching, I guess that that would be learning lessons from Napoleon as opposed to a different

14:03.880 --> 14:07.600
 kind of distribution of forces and then getting bogged down in the winter.

14:07.600 --> 14:14.560
 But the point is, these ambitions sometimes do, you know, the ambitions of empire sometimes

14:14.560 --> 14:18.840
 do materialize in the growth and the building and the establishment, those empires and those

14:18.840 --> 14:25.080
 empires write the history books in such a way that we don't think of them as empires

14:25.080 --> 14:27.880
 or we certainly don't think of them as the bad guys.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.640
 They write the history books, therefore, they're the good guys.

14:30.640 --> 14:35.080
 And right now, America has effectively written the book about the good guys.

14:35.080 --> 14:41.680
 I happen to believe that book, but it's we should be humbled and open minded to realize

14:41.680 --> 14:47.280
 that that is, in fact, what is happening is effective empires write the history books and

14:47.280 --> 14:51.920
 tell us stories and tell us propaganda and tell us narratives that we believe because

14:51.920 --> 14:55.920
 we are human beings and we love to get together and believe ideas.

14:55.920 --> 15:00.600
 We love to dream of a beautiful world and try to build that beautiful world together.

15:00.600 --> 15:06.640
 In the United States, that's a beautiful world, the freedom of respect of human rights, of

15:06.640 --> 15:11.240
 all men are created equal, pursuit of happiness.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.160
 You know, it always sounds good.

15:13.160 --> 15:19.200
 If you look at what the dream of communism is, it's sure as heck, in its words on the

15:19.200 --> 15:24.480
 surface sounds good, respect for the workers, the working class, the lower classes that

15:24.480 --> 15:30.560
 have been trodden on, that have been stolen from by the powerful, they deserve to have

15:30.560 --> 15:35.640
 the money, the power, the respect that they have earned to their hard work.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.640
 Sounds great.

15:36.640 --> 15:44.680
 And everybody gets along and we just have to, you know, all men are wonderful people.

15:44.680 --> 15:51.000
 And if they go bad, it has something to do with the fact that they have been oppressed.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.160
 And that dream just never worked out.

15:54.160 --> 15:59.000
 And even it is when you think about it, and I didn't think about it.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.840
 When you're young, you just emotionally, you accept it.

16:02.840 --> 16:09.800
 But when you think about it, somehow that new, wonderful organization has to organize

16:09.800 --> 16:11.360
 itself.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.320
 Even though Lenin predicted that the state eventually would go away.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.960
 Well, how does it work?

16:15.960 --> 16:17.840
 Then you have like anarchy, right?

16:17.840 --> 16:19.840
 You have to have an organization.

16:19.840 --> 16:26.800
 And the only way to really organize a large number of people is with a hierarchy.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.040
 So and who gets to the top?

16:30.040 --> 16:34.960
 The ones that want to go to the top, the ones that believe in themselves, the ones that

16:34.960 --> 16:37.360
 know better than everybody else.

16:37.360 --> 16:43.640
 And once you have that hierarchy established, there is no guarantee that it won't go bad.

16:43.640 --> 16:48.880
 And actually, when you look at history, every such hierarchy has gone bad.

16:48.880 --> 16:55.320
 You know, you look at Cuba, for instance, I believe Fidel Castro was an honest revolutionary.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.320
 I do believe that.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.800
 And so what did Cuba turn into?

17:00.800 --> 17:05.760
 Yeah, there's something about, and you speak about Vladimir Putin in this way, but let's

17:05.760 --> 17:08.840
 step away from that for a second.

17:08.840 --> 17:15.680
 Is there something about being an honest revolutionary that wants to do good for their country?

17:15.680 --> 17:21.000
 And you start to believe that you know better than everyone else how to do good in the country.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.120
 And you very well might first.

17:24.120 --> 17:31.600
 But then somehow that grows into a distortion field where you know, you keep believing you

17:31.600 --> 17:33.160
 know what's right.

17:33.160 --> 17:38.240
 And all the people who disagree with you, you stop seeing them as having a point.

17:38.240 --> 17:47.000
 You instead see them as like evil manipulators of the truth that are actually trying to hurt

17:47.000 --> 17:51.720
 people for their own greed, for their own power, and you will protect the people because

17:51.720 --> 17:52.720
 you know what's good.

17:52.720 --> 17:57.520
 In the case of Stalin, I mean, I don't know.

17:57.520 --> 18:03.920
 But it seems like he really believed that communism would bring about a much better

18:03.920 --> 18:04.920
 world.

18:04.920 --> 18:11.960
 I mean, there was a sense, you have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.

18:11.960 --> 18:18.680
 This idea that sacrifice is necessary to bring about a greater world.

18:18.680 --> 18:27.800
 And then the other aspect is sort of ruling by terror, creating terrorism, justified political

18:27.800 --> 18:30.680
 mechanism to achieve a better world.

18:30.680 --> 18:35.320
 So it wasn't, I mean, perhaps he had to do that to be able to sleep at night with the

18:35.320 --> 18:37.680
 atrocities he's committing.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.840
 I think he believed he will bring about a better world.

18:41.840 --> 18:46.120
 And by the way, the terror didn't start with Stalin, it started right after the Bolsheviks

18:46.120 --> 18:55.840
 took over when Lenin told Mr. Dzerzhinsky, Kamil Dzerzhinsky, to build the Chekha and

18:55.840 --> 19:03.240
 then execute the, this is what he called it, the Red Terror.

19:03.240 --> 19:11.080
 So at the birth of the Soviet Union, there was already terror and it was deliberate.

19:11.080 --> 19:18.680
 And it also was, it wasn't just focused on the enemies, it was focused on whoever you

19:18.680 --> 19:19.680
 didn't like.

19:19.680 --> 19:27.240
 There was no rule of law, there was no court cases, people were just pulled out of their

19:27.240 --> 19:31.640
 apartments and shot on site.

19:31.640 --> 19:40.480
 And this was done by revolutionaries who were convinced that eventually these sacrifices

19:40.480 --> 19:44.680
 had to be made and eventually that would lead to a much better planet.

19:44.680 --> 19:50.880
 And the populace believed this too, that those sacrifices in part, this is such a dark thing

19:50.880 --> 20:01.400
 about dictatorships is you believe it, but you're also too afraid to question your beliefs.

20:01.400 --> 20:07.080
 Like, you're not directly afraid, but almost like, I don't know what that is, that's almost

20:07.080 --> 20:08.920
 like a subconscious fear.

20:08.920 --> 20:13.560
 Like don't, there's a dark room with a locked door, don't look in that door, don't check

20:13.560 --> 20:14.560
 that door.

20:14.560 --> 20:20.040
 And there's something about the United States that says, especially modern culture, it's

20:20.040 --> 20:25.520
 like go to that door first and sort of question everything kind of, that's the power of freedom

20:25.520 --> 20:31.240
 of speech and the freedom of the press, but you can get almost become too critical and

20:31.240 --> 20:33.280
 too cynical of your own culture in that way.

20:33.280 --> 20:38.800
 So there's a balance of strike, of course, but man, if communists are not a lesson of

20:38.800 --> 20:44.160
 human nature, I don't know what is, but you believed without thinking too much about it,

20:44.160 --> 20:47.840
 you believed in the story of, what did you see?

20:47.840 --> 20:58.520
 Just, you know, I came from the Soviet Union, what did you maybe feel that's right and good

20:58.520 --> 21:01.480
 about communism, about the vision of communism?

21:01.480 --> 21:02.480
 Do you remember?

21:02.480 --> 21:12.720
 I think the biggest impetus in me believing in communism was that the communists, just

21:12.720 --> 21:20.000
 before Hitler took over, the communists were the only force in Germany that fought the

21:20.000 --> 21:26.320
 Nazis in the streets, and that's a historic truth.

21:26.320 --> 21:34.280
 And communists were hunted down by the Nazis, killed, put in concentration camps.

21:34.280 --> 21:41.320
 And so what we knew, what we were taught, and I think that was a huge unforced error

21:41.320 --> 21:46.360
 by the Western countries, particularly the United States, that there were ex Nazis in

21:46.360 --> 21:49.560
 the government in West Germany.

21:49.560 --> 21:57.960
 And the most famous one was Reinhard Gehlen, who was in charge, was the general in charge

21:57.960 --> 22:05.440
 of the intelligence on the Eastern Front, under Hitler.

22:05.440 --> 22:14.560
 And when the Allied won the war, it was decided that Gehlen was too important with his knowledge

22:14.560 --> 22:21.080
 of his organization, was too important to not use.

22:21.080 --> 22:26.560
 So he was corrupted by the CIA and eventually wound up being the head of the Bundesnachrichtendienst,

22:26.560 --> 22:29.480
 the CIA of West Germany.

22:29.480 --> 22:36.520
 That gave us, when I say us, the East German party a huge propaganda victory.

22:36.520 --> 22:47.000
 I wanted to, because the emotional aspect of this was as follows, when we were in juniors

22:47.000 --> 22:54.960
 in high school, and in those days, when you were only allowed to go to high school if

22:54.960 --> 22:57.120
 you were in the top 10% of students, okay?

22:57.120 --> 23:02.640
 So this was going to be the next set of ruling elite in the country.

23:02.640 --> 23:09.000
 We were sent, we were required to visit a concentration camp.

23:09.000 --> 23:18.240
 And if you know what we, as 17 year olds, were made to look at, it was gut wrenching.

23:18.240 --> 23:28.080
 How can men do something like that to men, piles of corpses, lampshades made out of human

23:28.080 --> 23:35.400
 skin because that skin had tattoos on them, and a shrunken head, so heads like the size

23:35.400 --> 23:42.640
 of my fist, I mean, the girls all cried, and it would have made a huge impression.

23:42.640 --> 23:47.520
 And that was the Nazis, and the communists defeated the Nazis.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.960
 The communists were the Nazi fighters, they were the good guys.

23:49.960 --> 23:53.800
 Of course, in hindsight, if the communists had come to power, it would have been just

23:53.800 --> 23:58.960
 the other way around, as we know, given the example of Stalin and Mao, right?

23:58.960 --> 24:02.240
 So, but we didn't know that, right?

24:02.240 --> 24:10.920
 From the Russian and Soviet perspective, the communist regime banded together to win the

24:10.920 --> 24:12.960
 Great Patriotic War.

24:12.960 --> 24:18.720
 And that was the second one, you know, the big brother, the Soviet Union, I mean, when

24:18.720 --> 24:22.920
 I was approached by the KGB, that was like, oh, I felt so honored.

24:22.920 --> 24:31.680
 So, we should say that we're talking about East Germany, that you're from East Germany.

24:31.680 --> 24:37.480
 Can you describe, you were born four years, and what is it, four years?

24:37.480 --> 24:38.480
 Ten days?

24:38.480 --> 24:40.800
 Yeah, sort of, very good.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.800
 After World War II.

24:41.800 --> 24:46.000
 After Germany's unconditional surrender in World War II.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.720
 So what is East Germany, what is West Germany, what is East and West Germany, what is that,

24:51.720 --> 24:55.800
 what is the difference, what is the historical context here, what is World War II again,

24:55.800 --> 24:56.800
 and then...

24:56.800 --> 24:59.080
 Okay, well, let's do for some...

24:59.080 --> 25:05.000
 We don't have to go to World War I, which the result of which actually ceded World

25:05.000 --> 25:06.560
 War II, in some respects.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.800
 Yes, there's a long history, yes.

25:09.800 --> 25:17.680
 But let's start with World War II, so when Hitler came to power, he and his leadership

25:17.680 --> 25:25.040
 decided that the Germans needed more what they call Lebensraum, that means room to live.

25:25.040 --> 25:35.120
 So, and they would start expanding, and they went into France, they took Belgium to Netherlands,

25:35.120 --> 25:47.320
 they annexed Austria, and got a piece of Czechoslovakia, and then they decided to march into the

25:47.320 --> 25:52.280
 Soviet Union after they took Poland, yeah.

25:52.280 --> 25:57.720
 They cut up Poland together with the Soviet Union, and they were friends, they were...

25:57.720 --> 26:03.280
 There was a nonaggression pact between, that was signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov, right?

26:03.280 --> 26:08.280
 I think both parties knew that eventually they would fall apart, but at the time, it

26:08.280 --> 26:15.280
 gave the Soviet Union a little more, a piece of Poland, and a little more time to prepare

26:15.280 --> 26:26.240
 what they thought might happen down the road, and the Germans had the time and the ability

26:26.240 --> 26:29.320
 to pretty much conquer all of Western Europe.

26:29.320 --> 26:33.120
 Do you think Stalin really knew that it's going to fall apart?

26:33.120 --> 26:36.120
 Why would somebody like Stalin trust somebody like Hitler?

26:36.120 --> 26:42.600
 But why did he blunder so bad not to read the intelligence that was coming his way,

26:42.600 --> 26:45.960
 that the troops are amassing on the border of the Soviet Union?

26:45.960 --> 26:49.080
 He didn't trust his own intelligence apparatus.

26:49.080 --> 26:58.400
 Here's one example, there was a German Communist who went on the ground when Hitler took over

26:58.400 --> 27:02.520
 and he went to Japan as a journalist, his name is Richard Sorge.

27:02.520 --> 27:11.160
 Richard Sorge had really, really good intel about what the Japanese would do and not do,

27:11.160 --> 27:18.320
 and I forgot exactly what it was, but it came to Moscow and Stalin totally ignored it.

27:18.320 --> 27:26.760
 And when Sorge was captured by the Japanese, the Soviet Union denied that he was one of

27:26.760 --> 27:29.400
 theirs, so he was executed.

27:29.400 --> 27:34.480
 The paranoia, again, does a lot of damage.

27:34.480 --> 27:41.760
 When you don't believe your own intelligence apparatus, why bother having one?

27:41.760 --> 27:48.280
 Yeah, I mean, but I'm sure there's contradictory information coming in from the intelligence

27:48.280 --> 27:54.160
 apparatus, so it's difficult, I mean, first of all, nobody likes to be disagreed with,

27:54.160 --> 27:58.640
 especially when you become more and more powerful, and the intelligence apparatus is probably

27:58.640 --> 28:00.720
 giving information you don't like.

28:00.720 --> 28:09.440
 It's often negative information about basically information that says that the decisions you

28:09.440 --> 28:15.600
 made in the past are not great decisions, and that's a difficult truth to deal with.

28:15.600 --> 28:26.040
 So in the modern times, if we hop around briefly, is Vladimir Putin has been not happy with

28:26.040 --> 28:34.040
 the intelligence of the FSB, thereby, at least if you read the news, choosing to put more

28:34.040 --> 28:39.920
 priority to the GRU for the intelligence in Ukraine.

28:39.920 --> 28:46.760
 But I guess I suppose the same story happens there as it just throughout history is paranoia.

28:46.760 --> 28:59.120
 I give you an example that comes from a very reliable source, and that my best German friend

28:59.120 --> 29:09.560
 worked as a chemist in the Stasi, East German intelligence, and he eventually, he rose to

29:09.560 --> 29:14.320
 the rank of major and was in charge of the forgery department.

29:14.320 --> 29:20.120
 It's very likely that he made passports that I used to travel.

29:20.120 --> 29:26.000
 He was aware that there was intelligence that was collected, the Stasi was really good.

29:26.000 --> 29:32.800
 They had about a thousand people in West Germany, undercover agents, some of them in government,

29:32.800 --> 29:37.920
 and the central committee of the party, the decision makers, ignored it because it didn't

29:37.920 --> 29:43.560
 quite fit in their worldview, it didn't quite fit into their plans.

29:43.560 --> 29:53.360
 So and one delicious thing that I just want to add on to this, when Gorbachev wrote his

29:53.360 --> 30:02.000
 book about Perestroika and Glasnost, the East German rulers did not like it, they were

30:02.000 --> 30:08.240
 much more orthodox, so they had to print the books in translation, guess where they wound

30:08.240 --> 30:09.240
 up?

30:09.240 --> 30:17.000
 They were piled up in the hallways of the Stasi, they bought the entire print run.

30:17.000 --> 30:24.360
 Fascinating, but let's backtrack Operation Barbarossa, invasion of Hitler to the Soviet

30:24.360 --> 30:29.680
 Union, and then hopefully that leads us all the way to East Germany, West Germany after

30:29.680 --> 30:30.680
 the end of the war.

30:30.680 --> 30:36.280
 So what happened was the Soviet Union rolled into the Eastern part of Germany and the Western

30:36.280 --> 30:49.240
 Allies took a larger chunk, which was eventually occupied by the three Allies, the French,

30:49.240 --> 30:55.520
 the English and the Americans, and the Eastern part was occupied by the Soviet troops, and

30:55.520 --> 31:01.000
 the Soviet troops actually conquered Berlin.

31:01.000 --> 31:09.200
 And as in a contract, they decided that Berlin would be ruled by the four Allies, and they

31:09.200 --> 31:15.960
 all had free access to that city.

31:15.960 --> 31:24.000
 I was born in the East German part, which very quickly became ruled by communists slash

31:24.000 --> 31:30.800
 socialists, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party united, but the leaders of that new party

31:30.800 --> 31:32.360
 were all communists.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.360
 It's nevertheless called Democratic.

31:34.360 --> 31:42.120
 Yes, German Democratic Republic, which was formed a couple of months after I was born.

31:42.120 --> 31:51.520
 I was born into a remote southeastern corner of East Germany, and interestingly enough,

31:51.520 --> 31:54.480
 genetically, I'm only half German.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.600
 It's the other half.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.680
 The other half is Czech and Polish.

31:57.680 --> 31:58.680
 Nice.

31:58.680 --> 32:07.200
 And where I grew up, I could walk to the nicer river, which was the border with Poland, and

32:07.200 --> 32:14.600
 it was only about an hour by bus to get to the Czech border, so that's why I'm a mix.

32:14.600 --> 32:22.400
 So East Germany after the war was communist, socialist, and then the West Germany was representing

32:22.400 --> 32:25.320
 the Western world with democracy.

32:25.320 --> 32:35.160
 And what the United States did, this was really, really very forward looking, very strategic,

32:35.160 --> 32:41.480
 the Marshall Plan to rebuild the economy in the West as compared to what the Soviet Union

32:41.480 --> 32:42.480
 did.

32:42.480 --> 32:49.760
 Whatever they hadn't destroyed on the way in, they took with them on the way out for reparations,

32:49.760 --> 32:52.360
 because they had every right to do that.

32:52.360 --> 32:59.240
 But it was not a good idea, because East Germany was always behind in economic development

32:59.240 --> 33:01.560
 to their Western counterpart.

33:01.560 --> 33:07.840
 So when you were young as today, but when you were young, you were clearly an exceptional

33:07.840 --> 33:08.840
 student.

33:08.840 --> 33:09.840
 Yeah.

33:09.840 --> 33:12.840
 You're a brilliant academic superstar.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.880
 Let's go to your childhood.

33:14.880 --> 33:22.040
 What's a fond memory from childhood that you have in being woken up to the beauty of this

33:22.040 --> 33:28.040
 world and sort of being curious about all the mysteries around you that I think ultimately

33:28.040 --> 33:33.480
 lead to academic success?

33:33.480 --> 33:34.480
 Or was it?

33:34.480 --> 33:38.760
 The fondest memory that comes to mind is my first kiss.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.760
 How's that?

33:39.760 --> 33:44.560
 Do you want to go to the details of that?

33:44.560 --> 33:47.240
 What did you make of that kiss?

33:47.240 --> 33:51.280
 What did that teach you about yourself and human nature and all that?

33:51.280 --> 33:53.240
 It taught me only in hindsight.

33:53.240 --> 33:57.640
 At the time, I was just like, my God, I was head over heels in love.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.720
 I was 16 years old.

34:00.720 --> 34:05.160
 And I knew in those days, I admired girls.

34:05.160 --> 34:10.720
 I knew that girls were like sort of magical beings.

34:10.720 --> 34:13.560
 They were not capable of doing evil things.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.160
 They were beautiful and they had to be adored.

34:16.160 --> 34:20.120
 And one of them actually loved me too.

34:20.120 --> 34:23.040
 He came after me initially, right?

34:23.040 --> 34:25.720
 And that too was magical for you.

34:25.720 --> 34:28.800
 Oh my God, yeah.

34:28.800 --> 34:36.040
 And literally, I dedicated, that's when I started studying up until that point, I just

34:36.040 --> 34:39.680
 did whatever I had to do to be in A minus students.

34:39.680 --> 34:45.080
 And that's when I started studying in every A that I got, I dedicated to her sometimes

34:45.080 --> 34:50.440
 explicitly because I knew I was going to take care of her as I grow up.

34:50.440 --> 34:54.120
 So you're going to have to work hard in this world to be somebody that could be adored

34:54.120 --> 34:55.880
 by those you love.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.200
 Yes, you're right.

34:57.200 --> 35:05.920
 You know that kiss, the next day, I was running around in school with a grin on my face.

35:05.920 --> 35:09.880
 Maybe that in some way, that grin never fades.

35:09.880 --> 35:12.760
 So what about the heartbreak that followed?

35:12.760 --> 35:27.200
 But just to expand on this a little more because that passion that I had was an indication

35:27.200 --> 35:30.520
 that eventually love would play a big role in my life.

35:30.520 --> 35:31.520
 I wasn't aware of it.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.760
 I was just directed at this one girl.

35:34.760 --> 35:39.480
 But that you understood that that feeling that taught you something like that you're

35:39.480 --> 35:47.120
 somebody that can feel those things and that's a strong part of who you are and therefore

35:47.120 --> 35:50.840
 it will also be a part of directing your life trajectory.

35:50.840 --> 35:51.840
 Yeah.

35:51.840 --> 35:55.360
 So we were an item for two years.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.880
 I lost my virginity.

35:57.880 --> 36:01.880
 She was not a virgin at the time.

36:01.880 --> 36:02.880
 My competitor was...

36:02.880 --> 36:07.400
 There always is a competitor, isn't that how it works?

36:07.400 --> 36:09.760
 He studied medicine in college already.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.840
 In which ways was he better than you?

36:11.840 --> 36:12.840
 He wasn't.

36:12.840 --> 36:18.000
 He was older and he was more experienced and he was going to be a doctor.

36:18.000 --> 36:22.880
 But I was there and he was not.

36:22.880 --> 36:23.880
 Presence wins.

36:23.880 --> 36:24.880
 Yeah.

36:24.880 --> 36:25.880
 But you still had big dreams.

36:25.880 --> 36:28.320
 You wanted to be a 10 year professor.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.320
 Yes.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.320
 Yes.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.400
 So you still want to all do that guy.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.400
 Oh yeah.

36:33.400 --> 36:39.200
 And she eventually told me that he was not in a picture anymore.

36:39.200 --> 36:46.280
 So it was back and forth, back and forth and our senior year we were an item and I was

36:46.280 --> 36:48.840
 just dreaming of the future.

36:48.840 --> 36:54.960
 But we didn't figure out that in those days if she went to college in Berlin and I went

36:54.960 --> 37:06.560
 to college in Jena and the distance between the two cities was too much for a weekend

37:06.560 --> 37:07.560
 visit.

37:07.560 --> 37:13.520
 Public transportation was very slow and nobody had cars.

37:13.520 --> 37:18.120
 So the circumstance of life you drift a car.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.120
 Yeah.

37:19.120 --> 37:23.200
 And so we interacted with a couple of letters and then I got the goodbye letter.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.960
 Oh my God.

37:24.960 --> 37:25.960
 That hurt.

37:25.960 --> 37:29.800
 I can still feel it.

37:29.800 --> 37:36.520
 You know when that's a good thing that you could feel the pain that's still part of love.

37:36.520 --> 37:42.680
 The pain of loss is still part of love and then you kind of change that you shape it

37:42.680 --> 37:46.680
 and you give that love in deeper more profound ways to future people.

37:46.680 --> 37:51.800
 It's very well put but at the time it emptied me out.

37:51.800 --> 38:00.600
 If I had a tendency to have suicidal thoughts I might have killed myself.

38:00.600 --> 38:04.840
 Would you say that was one of the darker moments of your life?

38:04.840 --> 38:07.360
 Let me see.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.120
 As a single moment yes.

38:09.120 --> 38:19.200
 So I still remember we had a mail slot in the front door and I was expecting a letter

38:19.200 --> 38:26.840
 any day and there was the letter I go upstairs into my bedroom and I open it and I read it

38:26.840 --> 38:30.360
 and it's just like the life went out of me.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.800
 Just there alone and you have to experience this pain alone.

38:33.800 --> 38:37.760
 So but now you're deeply alone in this world.

38:37.760 --> 38:46.080
 Yes because I didn't have a there was no emotional relationship with my parents.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.800
 I literally had nobody.

38:47.800 --> 38:51.520
 So this love you have in you had no place to go.

38:51.520 --> 38:55.040
 It was choked off.

38:55.040 --> 39:02.960
 But what I did was I wanted to go on.

39:02.960 --> 39:07.560
 And so I threw myself into the study of chemistry.

39:07.560 --> 39:12.640
 I outworked all of my fellow students in a big way.

39:12.640 --> 39:18.680
 I just like I worked my ass off and since I was pretty smart too I just ace practically

39:18.680 --> 39:20.240
 everything.

39:20.240 --> 39:24.400
 And for the first two years in college and look we go to college they're all these pretty

39:24.400 --> 39:26.080
 girls and there's dances and everything.

39:26.080 --> 39:33.120
 We had this this great student club where I didn't look at any girls like I eventually

39:33.120 --> 39:41.240
 I knew I was going to you want to have female companionship but love no more that hurts.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.360
 There's a song that goes love hurts.

39:43.360 --> 39:45.280
 Yeah and I know that one.

39:45.280 --> 39:46.280
 That's true.

39:46.280 --> 39:50.760
 There's actually many songs that have a similar message yes.

39:50.760 --> 39:58.000
 So during that time during your excellence just being an exceptional student of chemistry

39:58.000 --> 39:59.240
 let's go to your story.

39:59.240 --> 40:06.360
 So in your book Deep Undercover My Secret Life entangled the allegiances as a KGB spy in

40:06.360 --> 40:11.600
 America and in the really really excellent podcast series that I've been listening to

40:11.600 --> 40:15.120
 it's people should definitely listen to it's called The Agent.

40:15.120 --> 40:20.400
 You document your time as a KGB spy before during and after.

40:20.400 --> 40:28.200
 Can you tell the story of when you first were contacted by the KGB those how you were invited

40:28.200 --> 40:30.360
 the offer to join was made.

40:30.360 --> 40:36.720
 Well it was a big surprise and I never thought of myself as a potential agent you know I

40:36.720 --> 40:42.600
 was going to be a tenured professor and joined the ruling elite because in Europe tenured

40:42.600 --> 40:47.640
 professors are few it's not like in the United States you know anybody who teaches at colleges

40:47.640 --> 40:49.800
 as a title of professor.

40:49.800 --> 40:50.800
 Easy now.

40:50.800 --> 40:51.800
 It's true.

40:51.800 --> 40:52.800
 Yes.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.800
 That's not a criticism.

40:53.800 --> 40:54.800
 100%.

40:54.800 --> 41:00.960
 I would clarify that tenured professor or not it is a very prestigious position throughout

41:00.960 --> 41:07.920
 history of Europe and I would say especially communists I don't actually know the full

41:07.920 --> 41:12.680
 landscape of the respect but at least in the Soviet Union where I grew up it's a prestigious

41:12.680 --> 41:13.680
 position.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.680
 Absolutely was.

41:14.680 --> 41:24.200
 And the town had about 100,000 people there and it's a wild guess but maybe 30 tenured

41:24.200 --> 41:26.880
 professors and they were part of the ruling elite.

41:26.880 --> 41:33.000
 I was trying to do it as much as I can to live the good life right you know have access

41:33.000 --> 41:35.800
 to things that are nice.

41:35.800 --> 41:41.800
 Yeah but I think the powerful thing about being a professor in that context of East

41:41.800 --> 41:44.520
 Germany is the prestige.

41:44.520 --> 41:51.400
 And the feeling of superiority you know I was full of myself you know when you are the

41:51.400 --> 41:59.640
 best of the best and my third year I received a scholarship the Karl Marx scholarship that

41:59.640 --> 42:07.240
 was limited to 100 concurrent recipients in the country so my god you know I was full

42:07.240 --> 42:08.240
 of myself.

42:08.240 --> 42:20.360
 I believed in myself hook line and sinker and I was also I got a lot of accolades from

42:20.360 --> 42:22.760
 teachers and fellow students.

42:22.760 --> 42:29.080
 They were feeding the ego the old I mean you have to believe in yourself often when you

42:29.080 --> 42:34.840
 are young to truly to excel and you sure as I did.

42:34.840 --> 42:39.480
 But you know as a balance you need a mentor somebody who puts things in perspective and

42:39.480 --> 42:41.120
 I didn't have one.

42:41.120 --> 42:45.960
 My father was a non entity and nobody else they all looked up to me.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.920
 I was an up and coming guy right.

42:47.920 --> 42:50.360
 So there's no father figure that put you in your place.

42:50.360 --> 42:56.200
 Not at all and I give you one extreme example it was down the road when I fathered a child

42:56.200 --> 43:03.320
 out of wedlock that was in my fifth year I believe.

43:03.320 --> 43:07.080
 The Communist Party in East Germany was very moralistic.

43:07.080 --> 43:13.640
 If you did that they would have a talk with you and give you whatever a severe reprimand.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.520
 Nobody even mentioned a word about this.

43:16.520 --> 43:20.360
 So yeah so this is this is how this ego gets nurtured.

43:20.360 --> 43:25.240
 But anyway getting back to how the KGB came in contact.

43:25.240 --> 43:34.240
 So they most likely got knowledge of me by you know looking at Stasi records.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.240
 What Stasi.

43:35.240 --> 43:42.240
 Oh that was East German secret police start security for the state.

43:42.240 --> 43:45.720
 There's that word security again.

43:45.720 --> 43:52.600
 And that they pretty much kept a record on everybody in the country and so when you when

43:52.600 --> 43:55.880
 you look through this and this is what the KGB was looking for.

43:55.880 --> 43:59.960
 They were looking for candidates particularly for this kind of job that they had in mind

43:59.960 --> 44:08.960
 for me for candidates who were not you know in their mid 20s who were not fully developed

44:08.960 --> 44:17.240
 yet but mature enough to get there and still young enough right.

44:17.240 --> 44:20.200
 Because at that level of maturity you can test whether they can handle this kind of

44:20.200 --> 44:21.200
 job.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.600
 Yes absolutely right.

44:22.600 --> 44:33.560
 So and one day I got a knock on my door and my dorm room door was on a Saturday and they

44:33.560 --> 44:43.560
 knew that I was by myself how did they know it we had a I pieced this together.

44:43.560 --> 44:52.280
 We had an exchange student from the Soviet Union and he was next door to me and he you

44:52.280 --> 44:59.440
 know he befriended me so he got to know me a little bit and the pattern was that my roommate

44:59.440 --> 45:02.560
 would always go home for the weekend.

45:02.560 --> 45:06.920
 And of course they also knew which door to knock on even though there were no nameplates

45:06.920 --> 45:08.920
 right.

45:08.920 --> 45:16.440
 Somebody knocks and I knew it was a stranger because if it had been a student the pattern

45:16.440 --> 45:18.960
 was that we would knock on the door and then go in.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.960
 We wouldn't wait for somebody to let us in.

45:21.960 --> 45:27.160
 So I didn't wait it for 10 seconds and he didn't come in.

45:27.160 --> 45:34.040
 I knew that it was a stranger and said come on in and then came a person who spoke fluent

45:34.040 --> 45:40.120
 German so that was not a KGB guide it was a collaborator.

45:40.120 --> 45:45.160
 And so he started making a bunch of small talk he introduced himself as the as a representative

45:45.160 --> 45:54.800
 of Carl Zeiss Jena which was the optics company that made there was made really really good

45:54.800 --> 45:58.520
 optical instruments was one of the best in the world.

45:58.520 --> 46:05.160
 So it's like though you know there's the super prestigious company in that place.

46:05.160 --> 46:11.520
 And he said you know that he was a representative of that company and he would just want to

46:11.520 --> 46:18.400
 find out what my plans were after graduating from college and at that point I knew he wasn't

46:18.400 --> 46:24.560
 from Carl Zeiss Jena because in those days there was no recruitment.

46:24.560 --> 46:33.160
 You when you were done if you were in the top 10 percent of the graduates you would

46:33.160 --> 46:37.720
 most likely pick to stay and get a doctorate right.

46:37.720 --> 46:43.200
 And the rest of them were assigned you know where you had no choice.

46:43.200 --> 46:48.120
 So that guy was an idiot.

46:48.120 --> 46:53.720
 He didn't know the basics about you interviewed him a little bit to understand like oh sure

46:53.720 --> 46:58.440
 you know I you know I started like feel out is this guy full of shit because yeah he's

46:58.440 --> 47:00.560
 a stranger showing up to your dormant.

47:00.560 --> 47:06.760
 I knew that at that point I knew he was Stasi which is wrong but it doesn't matter because

47:06.760 --> 47:10.200
 he was German and I had no idea that the KGB would be involved.

47:10.200 --> 47:14.520
 So sorry to pause briefly.

47:14.520 --> 47:16.320
 Did you have a sense.

47:16.320 --> 47:22.280
 Did people know that there's a Stasi type of organization that there is a large number

47:22.280 --> 47:27.480
 of people doing this kind of work in East Germany in order for you to make that guess.

47:27.480 --> 47:30.560
 Yeah we knew that the Stasi existed.

47:30.560 --> 47:39.640
 We even had our James Bond you know we had a series called the invisible visor when a

47:39.640 --> 47:45.040
 Stasi employee in East Germany would go into West Germany and hunt down Nazis.

47:45.040 --> 47:47.520
 So yes the Stasi was known to be there.

47:47.520 --> 47:51.600
 And admired in part or feared or both.

47:51.600 --> 47:55.200
 I thought they were necessary and I admired them.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.200
 James Bond.

47:56.200 --> 48:04.720
 Yes the reason I did so because I had no information to the contrary I never knew anybody personally

48:04.720 --> 48:16.760
 or even you know somewhat removed who was followed by the Stasi was you know put in

48:16.760 --> 48:23.600
 jail I had no clue that they did a lot of damage and that they were like doing a lot

48:23.600 --> 48:30.200
 of surveillance of the East German population the same way the KGB did for the Soviet Union.

48:30.200 --> 48:38.360
 So for me to be talking to somebody from the Stasi it was it raised my interest.

48:38.360 --> 48:44.180
 I was curious what comes next because I sort of knew something interesting would be coming

48:44.180 --> 48:49.120
 at me and I had no I had no other thoughts about that at that point.

48:49.120 --> 48:55.720
 So when when he was finally when he he went in he went for the kill by reversing himself

48:55.720 --> 49:00.480
 he said you know I got to tell you that I really I really am not from Karl Zeiss Jena

49:00.480 --> 49:05.520
 I'm from the government okay thank you for pointing that out.

49:05.520 --> 49:11.880
 And then he asked this question he says can you imagine to one day work for the government

49:11.880 --> 49:17.640
 and so I gave a pretty clever answer I said yes but not as a chemist.

49:17.640 --> 49:23.240
 So we I answered the question that he didn't ask I helped him out.

49:23.240 --> 49:31.280
 So we made an arrangement to meet for lunch which in Germany is the main meal at the number

49:31.280 --> 49:38.760
 one restaurant in Jena I still remember what I ate what was that rum steak with butter on

49:38.760 --> 49:43.200
 top and french fries was my favorite.

49:43.200 --> 49:49.080
 Anyway so when I get to the restaurant I saw this fellow sitting in the back there at the

49:49.080 --> 49:52.480
 table and there was another person at the table.

49:52.480 --> 49:58.560
 So I was a little bit hesitant because in those days it was not unusual for perfect

49:58.560 --> 50:04.680
 strangers to share a table because there wasn't wouldn't enough tables and chairs and so forth.

50:04.680 --> 50:09.840
 So I didn't know if I could approach him but he he got up and came to me and he took me

50:09.840 --> 50:21.080
 to the table and he said I want to introduce Herman we work with our Soviet comrades KGB

50:21.080 --> 50:26.920
 and then he disappeared he says I got something else to do I never knew his name he just handed

50:26.920 --> 50:29.600
 me over to the KGB.

50:29.600 --> 50:35.400
 What was the relationship between the KGB and the Stazis as collaborators close collaborators

50:35.400 --> 50:37.720
 or just distant associates.

50:37.720 --> 50:43.240
 They were pretty close collaborators as I told you that you know they they bought forged

50:43.240 --> 50:47.800
 documents that the Germans made because the Germans were better at forgery.

50:47.800 --> 50:54.160
 They also exchanged information but they didn't trust each other 100% and and and I and I tell

50:54.160 --> 51:01.280
 you why I know that so they recruited me to send me to West Germany.

51:01.280 --> 51:05.400
 As I already said East Germany had a thousand agents over there why would they have to want

51:05.400 --> 51:06.920
 to have their own.

51:06.920 --> 51:13.960
 Yeah yeah okay this is fascinating internal and external dynamic of distrust yeah okay

51:13.960 --> 51:21.880
 so there you are welcomed by the KGB when did the offer the invite come well that took

51:21.880 --> 51:29.800
 a while so Herman and I had an unofficial relationship for about a year and a half.

51:29.800 --> 51:39.440
 I would meet him once a week once every two weeks initially in his car but then he took

51:39.440 --> 51:48.880
 me to a conspirational flat that was an apartment that was occupied by a party member a lady

51:48.880 --> 51:55.320
 single lady when we came in she would leave she left us tea and cookies and then we could

51:55.320 --> 52:02.560
 freely talk he also at that time gave me some West German literature magazines to read

52:02.560 --> 52:09.040
 which was of course forbidden so already starting to feel somewhat special and as we were talking

52:09.040 --> 52:15.800
 about what they had in mind for me in general I knew that I was going to be even more special

52:15.800 --> 52:24.040
 because I would be above the law I would operate outside the law of the countries I would go

52:24.040 --> 52:32.840
 to as well as East Germany because you know the magazines and eventually when I joined

52:32.840 --> 52:39.760
 up they told me I had better watch West German television which was also not explicitly prohibited

52:39.760 --> 52:47.000
 but it was something that could get you in trouble so on many levels you're super special

52:47.000 --> 52:55.200
 you're the jazz bond yes yes so what was that recruitment testing process like testing

52:55.200 --> 53:05.720
 whether you are you have what it takes to be a KGB agent first of all we had very in

53:05.720 --> 53:18.440
 depth talks me Herman and I about life and I was I still am very honest and sharing my

53:18.440 --> 53:24.360
 feelings philosophical or personal personal I even I even told him that I was shy around

53:24.360 --> 53:31.880
 the girls he was giving you a relationship advice or what was the dynamic can you tell

53:31.880 --> 53:40.760
 me was it a father son brother brother yeah he was maybe in his early to mid 30s and I

53:40.760 --> 53:45.200
 was maybe 10 years younger and what languages did he speak he spoke German he spoke German

53:45.200 --> 53:51.880
 pretty well but he's originally from Russia yeah with a Russian accent so I got in trouble

53:51.880 --> 53:57.720
 one time with him when when I asked him is your real name German he didn't like that

53:57.720 --> 54:03.680
 he didn't like it what was he good with girls was was no no you know I remember what he

54:03.680 --> 54:09.960
 told me he says you know you got to understand one thing they're looking for guys too that's

54:09.960 --> 54:16.720
 that's all no girls are looking at yeah it's a competitive game yeah yeah don't don't

54:16.720 --> 54:20.760
 don't worry about it you know don't be so shy so that little flame of love that we talked

54:20.760 --> 54:27.000
 about yeah in all the shapes that it takes in our life did he talk to you about that that

54:27.000 --> 54:34.520
 could be taken advantage of that that could be used or was it implied yeah but not in

54:34.520 --> 54:39.320
 it was not very focused not in great detail so let's so we talked about personal stuff

54:39.320 --> 54:46.840
 and you know like dislikes he gave me tasks for instance when my friend and I hitchhiked

54:46.840 --> 54:51.840
 from from East Germany all the way down to Bulgaria he told me to write a report about

54:51.840 --> 55:00.040
 it what I saw so fundamentally he wanted to see how well I can I can write and how well

55:00.040 --> 55:08.040
 I can report how well I observe he also asked me to write some profiles about fellow students

55:08.040 --> 55:12.920
 I don't believe that was for them to give him to the Stasi it was just like how well

55:12.920 --> 55:17.600
 do I characterize people what's it that's important when you're talking about when I

55:17.600 --> 55:23.800
 was in the u.s. active in the u.s. I operated as a spotter so I did exactly that I wrote

55:23.800 --> 55:36.280
 profiles about people he also gave me some tasks to do that were rather unpleasant quite

55:36.280 --> 55:42.680
 he would give me an address and a name of the people who lived at the address and he

55:42.680 --> 55:49.280
 told me to go there ring the doorbell and find out something about a relative who lived

55:49.280 --> 55:57.000
 in West Germany that is undercover exploration right so you go you you make up a story and

55:57.000 --> 56:03.760
 somehow win the confidence of your target to tell you something that you want to know

56:03.760 --> 56:08.880
 was that did that come naturally to you no no I hated it the charisma involved which

56:08.880 --> 56:14.400
 part did you hear charisma I think I didn't know that I had it it took you some time

56:14.400 --> 56:21.280
 to discover because you know I was I always was and I still am to some degree a bit shy

56:21.280 --> 56:26.040
 I lost a lot of the shyness of after moving to the south because here in the United States

56:26.040 --> 56:34.120
 because you don't have to be shy you know you can let your love shine that's exactly

56:34.120 --> 56:40.640
 right so but anyway I hate it doing that but I did it well I still remember so I and those

56:40.640 --> 56:48.600
 days I had a I had a beard and I and I rang the bell and all handsome fella yeah and and

56:48.600 --> 56:54.880
 I looked the part I said I'm a sociology student and I'm doing a survey and I asked

56:54.880 --> 57:00.760
 a whole bunch of questions get would you like to answer the questions there's no problem

57:00.760 --> 57:09.240
 and then I directed the conversation to the ladies private life and and she actually gave

57:09.240 --> 57:14.680
 me information she volunteered information that I wanted to know beautiful I did well

57:14.680 --> 57:21.840
 and the other one that I didn't like but I also did well with when when Herman drove

57:21.840 --> 57:27.200
 me around the city and showed me a building and he said find out what organization is

57:27.200 --> 57:33.960
 in there what they do maybe get to know some people and I did that pretty well also you

57:33.960 --> 57:40.120
 know you have to be inventive you know to to come up with a cover story and and I've

57:40.120 --> 57:48.080
 always been quite inventive you know I'm a storyteller at heart and that I didn't know

57:48.080 --> 57:53.040
 it then but that you know but there was still something unpleasant about it yes yes which

57:53.040 --> 57:59.760
 part was the shyness and then you know you know I wasn't very comfortable lying I became

57:59.760 --> 58:08.960
 comfortable down the road but you know I was prudely honest and never never hit anything

58:08.960 --> 58:20.640
 of me but you know over time you lose that that uncomfortable feeling and you rationalize

58:20.640 --> 58:25.680
 that you got to do it there's only one way right and you're serving a good cause so you

58:25.680 --> 58:31.200
 were talking to Herman for a year and a half year and a half and then how did that progress

58:31.200 --> 58:39.080
 yes so he said he finally I guess he sent a report to headquarters in Berlin and then

58:39.080 --> 58:47.240
 he sent me on a three week quote unquote practice trip to Berlin as was the first time when

58:47.240 --> 58:54.920
 I had a like a conspiracy conspiratorial meeting where I would I had an address in a time and

58:54.920 --> 59:02.720
 a code phrase and I met another agent his name was Boris these names meet were meaningless

59:02.720 --> 59:07.440
 they were all like cover names right so what was the code in the mean what was then what

59:07.440 --> 59:11.600
 can you give a little more that code I don't remember no but not the code but like what

59:11.600 --> 59:17.880
 do you mean by code so I tell you my the the code we use when I when I met while I was

59:17.880 --> 59:25.600
 active I would approach the other person who I thought maybe the person I want to meet we

59:25.600 --> 59:35.280
 both had some something to with us or on us to make us more likely to be the right person

59:35.280 --> 59:43.240
 so and I would I would ask him the following questions excuse me or I'm looking for Susan

59:43.240 --> 59:52.720
 Green and he and he would answer yes you must be David stupid if if I if I ask a stranger

59:52.720 --> 59:58.480
 and they would look at me well how could I help you so yeah no it's the wrong guy yeah

59:58.480 --> 1:00:03.840
 it's just a low probability that the right thing would be absolutely and it seems like

1:00:03.840 --> 1:00:09.320
 a safe statement yes it's not the right person exactly right just come off you sir or crazy

1:00:09.320 --> 1:00:13.560
 or whatever you would have you would have made a good secret agent you know you know

1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:22.560
 I'm not this is this is we'll discuss this dress like one actually yeah where there's

1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:30.200
 any dress code no just fit in fit in no matter what and then be creative yeah figure out ways

1:00:30.200 --> 1:00:38.040
 to write so anyways he give me some tasks and we and he since I had rented a room in a house

1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:52.280
 he gave me a western literature to read and we spent time together and there was a practice

1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:59.320
 run to West Germany actually there were two and that was very important in hindsight I

1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:07.720
 figured that out so I traveled to West Germany and no not to West Berlin with an East German

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:14.640
 passport that was stamped that that individual was allowed to go to the West and there was

1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:25.280
 a part of the border that was only guarded by Soviet troops and that's where they smuggled

1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:34.360
 me into West Germany I got on the subway and and then appeared in West Berlin no no Americans

1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:40.880
 no Brits no French knew that I had entered for his documents or not no no this was a

1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:47.720
 an East German passport it was real okay okay so and the first trip all they wanted me to

1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:55.440
 do is just walk around you know smell the air you know have a beer or whatever and eat a sausage

1:01:55.440 --> 1:02:03.160
 and then come back the second trip I had a task very similar to the one that I had back in

1:02:03.160 --> 1:02:10.200
 Jena to ring the doorbell some place and talk to some people and that worked very well is also

1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:18.040
 I should mention that you talk about that you know eat a sausage drink some beer I suppose

1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:25.000
 that's a good test too to see how you behave under Western like when first introduced to the

1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:32.520
 Western college like this is why I might not make a good agent is when I first came to the

1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:41.560
 United States and supermarket like bananas as many bananas as I want to eat that I think

1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:48.360
 how that I think that would break me it's just it's a shock to be to have access to Western

1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:55.360
 culture you're getting very close to the reason they actually made me do this these two practice

1:02:55.360 --> 1:03:02.840
 trips the at when I first emerged on West Berlin territory I felt highly uncomfortable

1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:08.800
 that was at the enemy right yeah and I saw the cops everywhere and even those though those

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:14.560
 cops had like light blue uniforms nothing they weren't standouts so I was wondering you know

1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:19.920
 if they knew that you know I had like KGB yeah on my forehead you are paranoid that they would

1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:25.520
 know they would see I was scared but I overcame that so that's oh can we just linger on that

1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:31.840
 because I suppose that's a natural like if I give anybody on the street the mission to do the

1:03:31.840 --> 1:03:38.800
 mission you have to do is they would be paranoid that's a natural human feeling is am I being

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:45.680
 watched do they know like if you try to steal something from a store there's going to be a

1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:50.480
 feeling like are they watching me or the cameras watching the people watching me they all know

1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:56.240
 that kind of stuff so you have to over oh you have to be somehow rugged and robust to that kind

1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:03.600
 of feeling it all overcome it yes exactly so and something very interesting happened while I was

1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:09.520
 being trained in Berlin I met a classmate of mine from high school and he confided to me that he

1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:17.360
 was recruited by the Stasi to become a spy go as a spy to West Germany and he also had this

1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:24.080
 practice trip and he peed in his pants he went back and told him I can't do that just from the

1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:33.440
 terror the yes that paranoia now this guy's career was over he had a he had an he had an

1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:40.000
 engineering degree he was a pretty smart guy he he was just for the rest of his life and he's still

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:46.400
 alive I believe floating around and you know trading in model railroads and stuff like that

1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:51.840
 you mean do you think that experience broke him or they wouldn't let him back in oh I see they

1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:59.200
 yeah so this is a test that if you fail you pay the price I had no idea that that you know

1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:07.360
 no something bad would happen if I fail that test but I didn't yeah I didn't fail so and this led

1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:15.520
 then to the offer all right after you know Boris was happy with me and he told his boss who was

1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:23.520
 most likely the the head of the KGB in East Berlin and I had an appointment to meet in East Germany

1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:29.680
 yes in East Germany yeah all of East Germany yes that's right an appointment to meet with him

1:05:30.560 --> 1:05:36.880
 and as we walk into the room there was this huge desk and a little guy sitting behind it

1:05:37.760 --> 1:05:48.400
 very very uh just like little and not unimpressive nice a lot of paraphernalia like you know had a

1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:57.520
 bust of Zhazinsky on on on his desk and and some some paintings Lenin and so forth but when the

1:05:57.520 --> 1:06:07.200
 guy opened his mouth he was like whoa huge psychological energy he spoke only Russian

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:13.600
 now and initially he would you know start to bet with five minutes worth of propaganda why we're

1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:20.320
 doing what we're doing I didn't need that I understood most of it but what I when when I

1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:26.880
 didn't understand I asked Boris to translate and then then he sprung it on me and I was not prepared

1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:35.600
 he he said so what are you in or not I was no I'm gonna I hadn't made up my mind I wasn't expecting

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:44.320
 that would come and so I said to him I'm not really trained you know there's a lot of things I need

1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:48.720
 to learn and I came up with a couple of really stupid things one not so stupid but the other

1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:53.680
 one was I don't know why I said that I said for instance I need to learn how to drive a car

1:06:53.680 --> 1:07:01.280
 and to type with a typewriter and he was he got really annoyed and he said don't worry about it

1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:07.920
 we'll train you yeah but I gotta tell you we need people who are decisive so I you got until tomorrow

1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:16.160
 noon to give Boris your decision that made for a sleepless night so what was going through your

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:26.400
 mind well I had this was almost 50 50 I knew I was gonna have a huge career a good career

1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:33.840
 I would I was on my way because you know this I was already employed by the university as an

1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:38.800
 assistant professor so that career would be to become a professor become a ten year professor

1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:46.400
 be a world class yes Yena had become my hometown I really loved the place it was my oyster

1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:56.800
 and and my family was my basketball team I was you love playing basketball absolutely you mean

1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:01.760
 yeah so this is home this is home this is where your love is this is home did you understand

1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:08.400
 that the choice involved leaving yes home behind yes and and the one thing I didn't have

1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:12.480
 the two things I didn't have an emotional relationship with my mother

1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:18.800
 and I didn't have a steady girlfriend at the time I think Freud would have a lot to say about that

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:25.520
 but yeah go ahead but the connection between those two but yeah I'm sure by the way my my friend

1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:31.600
 Gunther one who worked for the Stasi was also the Stasi tried to recruit him as an agent but he

1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:39.840
 had a love relationship at the time and he said politely no I won't I can't so you didn't have

1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:44.560
 that's the one thing that really could would have helped me would have held you to this place

1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:50.000
 is love so you got the career on the one hand my basketball team the town that I would be part

1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:56.720
 of the ruling elite of and then we had this great adventure and the ability to contribute

1:08:57.440 --> 1:09:04.720
 to the victory the worldwide victory of communism and and stick it to the Nazis and of course the

1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:13.040
 feeling that you're really special yeah James Bond yeah what's the question do I want to be a

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:18.400
 tenure professor or James Bond yes and and that as funny as that sounds that was probably a difficult

1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:24.640
 decision it was a difficult decision but fundamentally it wasn't it and it wasn't my zeal

1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:34.720
 to to help the revolution it was my my what they called what the Stasi was looking for

1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:41.200
 the KGB was looking for in a character that they would send over a well controlled inclination

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:51.040
 to adventure okay yeah yeah James Bond what do you say and the love of women yeah I was

1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:59.120
 yes but I gotta put this in right here because I'm telling people I have two things in common

1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:09.280
 with James Bond these are my initials JB and and I got the girl too three times yeah I mean

1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:15.520
 there that's and that's adventure yeah and and and the ability to travel to the west because

1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:20.640
 the west was closed off to us we could go to foreign countries but they all had to be communist

1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:30.000
 countries you know I wanted to see Paris because I I had fallen in love with the Honore Balzac who

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:37.920
 wrote a phenomenal set of novels that I just ate up and so I when I eventually did go to Paris I

1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:44.480
 knew all the places already because he described them all but anyway so that one it was a it was

1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:52.800
 51 49 but eventually it you know when you when you do the side by side intellectual comparison

1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:59.840
 that doesn't work it becomes a tie and then you know you just go with your gut and I say I'm in

1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:06.560
 so now that you successfully passed the test and you were sitting with this unimpressive man and

1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:16.000
 had the invite and had to sleep on it and have made the decision to join yeah what was next I

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.080
 was just told you you know that I was being recruited by the state department of East

1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:27.280
 Germany I was going to become a diplomat I must have had some paper but I forgot because

1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:32.320
 just by saying so then that would that wouldn't have worked there's some kind of document that

1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:39.360
 says the game yeah that was the only entanglement you had to that to that place no love no basketball

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:46.000
 basketball giving up basketball was huge for me I loved playing that game I started playing

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:51.760
 basketball when I was 18 that's a little late are you better offensive defensive what do you like

1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:58.400
 more do you like to shoot from a distance do you like I was a runner I was very very quick on my

1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:08.000
 feet and I was a good jumper too I typically played the the four position you know what's that

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:14.160
 forward oh the forward position forward position but anyway so that that that was the hardest

1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:20.960
 for me to give up but indeed the other thing that I remember I had to do to hand in my party

1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:28.720
 document to the party secretary of the university and he made a comment yeah we probably won't

1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:33.920
 hear much about you but we know that you're going to do something very important so he sort of had

1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:40.640
 an had an inkling that I'm going I'm going to go someplace on the cover or something like that

1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:48.480
 and then I packed my bags and got on a train to Berlin for another one of those secret meetings

1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:59.120
 with my my new handler Nicolai so and here here came another test that that would have been quite

1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:09.680
 easy to fail so I had lived in Vienna for six years in a dorm even when I became an employee

1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:14.320
 of the university they didn't they didn't have apartments I was still living in a dorm and

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:20.480
 and he won in a single room with a bed a chair and a table and toilet down the down the hallway

1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:29.200
 so I figured you know Berlin KGB I'm gonna get a nice apartment right and so Nicolai

1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:35.680
 took me into his car we started talking a little bit and then he said I have a task for you already

1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:43.120
 your first task is to find yourself a place to live I mean I don't think I showed it in my face

1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:50.480
 but you know my heart my my my heart dropped like down to into my pants I I knew this was

1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:57.360
 nearly impossible because there was a severe shortage of housing and in everywhere in Germany

1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:04.320
 East Germany and all the apartments and homes were controlled by by the government you you know

1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:11.120
 there were long waiting lists and I know I knew couples that were promised maybe to get an apartment

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:18.720
 five years down the road so and then they would postpone the decision to have a child anyway this

1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:26.720
 was impossible oh well you know but this was a test okay and so because I had to be inventive now

1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:33.920
 I had to figure out how to get out of an impossible situation I didn't realize it then at all I just

1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:42.480
 went with a flow you know what do I do so what I did I went I took the the train the city train

1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:51.520
 to the very last stop a little town called Akna and I wandered around in that town and

1:14:51.520 --> 1:14:56.880
 knocked on doors and asked people if they knew where somebody might have a place to live and

1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:01.360
 after a couple hours somebody said there's this lady that and she gave and they gave me the address

1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:07.760
 and I talked to the lady and she said I happen to have a place that you might that where you might

1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:14.720
 be able to stay it was an outbuilding I don't know what it what it served it was not a garage

1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:25.680
 it was concrete and it had a bed and a chair a running cold water and a stove a cold stove

1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:31.760
 that was my was going to be pretty basic pretty basic that's your basis are you kidding me that's

1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:38.080
 the uh toilet across the yard of course yeah well all the essentials what are you complaining about

1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:44.320
 so you were right you're right you had to run the uh the special the James Bond had to run a

1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:51.360
 special operation out of the yes outhouse to to to my credit and I think that that uh

1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:57.680
 that established part of my reputation I didn't complain at all to Nicolai that was part of the

1:15:57.680 --> 1:16:05.040
 test problem yeah I just told him you know I found something and so uh for six months I would get up

1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:11.520
 in the morning get on the train and walk around in the city you know did some operational stuff

1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:18.960
 operational training I went to the library did a lot of reading in the library and then I found

1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:24.880
 the basketball team that I could join so at least I could take a shower twice a week and

1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:34.720
 and apparently I took about six months that I was still on probation because after six

1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:41.360
 months Nicolai one day we were still meeting in his car he said he handed me a key he said

1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:43.760
 I'm going to take you to your new apartment

1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:53.440
 and now and I didn't know this you know that now I was really in okay imagine the hurdles you

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:59.520
 have to jump over and how many times you can fail but you know but not complaining not asking

1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:05.440
 questions yes I mean that was something you've written about um I think you wrote that bosses

1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:10.560
 do not like to hear complaints or problems they prefer solutions that's right so what was your

1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:19.840
 interaction like with the bosses is that essentially um represents the way it went forward as well

1:17:19.840 --> 1:17:26.560
 I no complaints get no complaints no arguments no no I know this better I was taking it all in

1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:32.000
 now that the the the technical guys you know they taught me something I didn't know that made sense

1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:36.560
 um what Nicolai some of the stuff that he taught me

1:17:36.560 --> 1:17:44.560
 was somewhat questionable he was a generalist and there's some things he didn't know really well

1:17:44.560 --> 1:17:51.360
 so I could have like asked and probed a little bit but I didn't so I just played along so this new

1:17:51.360 --> 1:18:00.640
 apartment was uh it was a studio it had a kitchen with running cold water and the bathroom was just

1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:07.760
 one flight down the toilet not a bathroom one flight down the the stairs an upgrade it was a

1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:14.880
 big upgrade and he gave me uh I think he gave me a thousand mark to buy by furniture and in that

1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:21.680
 place I actually I also bought a tv and started watching west german television so so it I finally

1:18:21.680 --> 1:18:30.800
 had a decent place to stay um and the the my training in berlin took about two years what was

1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:37.040
 the training what were the interesting aspects to the training what were sort of if you do an

1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:41.920
 overview systematic of what was the training process what was difficult what are some insights

1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:49.280
 that generalize to the training process of what it takes to be a kgb spy right so uh let me start

1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:59.200
 with a tradecraft so I was taught morse code that took a while uh I I was instructed in how to you

1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:07.520
 know use a shortwave radio and to receive uh the the shortwave uh transmissions with morse code

1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:18.000
 I was taught uh uh an encryption and decryption algorithm manual algorithm yep you you might

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:24.720
 be interested that eventually I figured out uh at least one of the patterns uh the the algorithm

1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:32.640
 was such that the and this was all about digits like uh and the algorithm was such that in the end

1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:40.320
 the uh the digits that were used to decipher other digits that were handed that were sent to me

1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:46.800
 via shortwave radio there were let's say if there were a hundred digits there were an equal number

1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:54.480
 of ones twos threes fours five six and seven and up until zero and I was told that uh these

1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:01.600
 algorithms these manual algorithms were were good for about 300 uses after that they could still be

1:20:02.320 --> 1:20:08.720
 deciphered I'm assuming nowadays that wouldn't take as much yeah with with computers for sure

1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:13.280
 but there's probably they're probably designed in a way that you can manually

1:20:13.280 --> 1:20:21.680
 sort of it's efficient and convenient to use them manually well it's not to optimize cryptographic

1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:27.120
 security it's to optimize it's like to balance security and like humans being able to actually

1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:32.400
 yeah no I gotta disagree it was neither efficient nor convenient it would took a long time so

1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:40.000
 when what was what was significantly easier to do uh but uh that would require you to have

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:46.400
 spy paraphernalia with you this is what's called a one time pad so you have the the set of numbers

1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:54.080
 on on a sheet of paper uh that had to be developed I had to use iodine to make those numbers visible

1:20:54.880 --> 1:21:01.760
 those are known to be uh unbreakable unless they are used multiple times the same the same

1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:06.320
 sheet of paper because you know the person who encrypts has the same set of numbers as the

1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:15.280
 person who decrypts and one one time use you cannot figure out what the message is oh interesting

1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:20.160
 but this is the quick way to communicate from one person to another one time one time well one

1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:26.240
 time when I had a pad with multiple uh sheets of paper right and uh the reason that they gave me

1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:34.240
 a manual one is because I literally I had only when I when I wound up in the United States I had

1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:42.560
 only one thing with me that uh only a spy can have and that was a uh a writing pad with uh

1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:48.400
 where the first 10 pages or so were impregnated with a trace of a chemical that was used for

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:53.280
 secret writing uh but you really would have to know what you're looking for to you know you see

1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:58.320
 this pad it was bought at you know Walmart and can you explain a little little further what

1:21:58.320 --> 1:22:03.840
 what is the chemical here that what are we talking about so how I don't understand how it's possible

1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:10.800
 to have a physical pad that does the encryption without any computing I how does it incorporate

1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:18.240
 so so no no it doesn't it doesn't do any work you know so and the uh the communication that

1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:27.280
 the encrypted communication was uh was a set of uh groups of five five digits and then another five

1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:34.640
 and there's always a gap in between um and uh so let's say if I get this radio transmission

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:40.400
 I write them all down and then I then I use my develop my algorithm and then I do mathematics

1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:47.360
 either addition or subtraction the resulting set of digits had then had a one to one correlation

1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:53.760
 to letters and this is an easy way to then do the correlation yes well that's cool that's uh

1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:59.040
 and you're saying the algorithm was not efficient it was not oh the manual that took a long time

1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:07.280
 and and you can't make an error right uh would you know where can you it's easy to debug no you

1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:11.440
 no you do it twice you do it twice and that's how you check if it's identical then you know

1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:16.320
 well like if it's not if it's not then then one is right and the other is wrong you gotta

1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:22.800
 make mistakes no that's right and I really didn't but anyway um so I was I was learning that

1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:31.520
 uh I was also uh told that I was required to become proficient in another language

1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:37.680
 and they gave me a choice and I picked English that's what was the other one oh no they gave

1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:43.120
 them pick one friend you know whatever is spoken in the west got it uh what was what was what would

1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:49.200
 be second to you would you would you think French because of Paris what would you what why English

1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:55.120
 English wasn't no brainer because I I was a straight A to A student in English without studying

1:23:55.120 --> 1:24:03.520
 and I like it came so easily to me yeah so that's why I chose it right so that was that then

1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:15.280
 I was taught the basics of counter surveillance you know some trickery and and surveillance

1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:23.760
 detection routes where you wander around in the city for three hours and determine whether

1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:30.240
 you're being followed or not that requires you to plan the route very well I give you one example

1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:38.400
 that that will illustrate that as my my favorite spot when when when I was in Moscow I did a lot

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:48.320
 of that also uh and if my favorite spot was I was a not well traveled uh uh road it went down the

1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:56.000
 hill and and curved and at the bottom of the hill there was a telephone booth and when you open the

1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:02.160
 door and and pick up the telephone you have to look back so it wasn't like this right it wasn't a

1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:08.160
 giveaway this was normal it was natural so yeah I could see if somebody would come walking after

1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:16.960
 me you know these kinds of things or you would uh you know use public transportation uh big

1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:26.320
 buildings uh where you needed to use an elevator and see who's because surveillance the the object

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:31.440
 of surveillance is to never lose sight of the individual who you're surveilling because at that

1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:37.920
 point you may miss the window where he does something that that you're looking for so somebody

1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:46.160
 always has to come close right did you have to also study surveillance no only counter surveillance

1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:55.120
 and what helped me in in in all my training uh you know I would be uh would have a competition

1:25:55.120 --> 1:26:03.440
 with the folks that were coming that were following me and me and I beat them every time uh they were

1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:09.280
 at a disadvantage because one of them always had to be close and and if you saw the same face twice

1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:16.240
 you know that you were being followed and I had a very very good uh memory for for faces so basically

1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:25.920
 figure out a fixed route and then a fixed route that allows you to uh survey the area and then record

1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:32.000
 the faces you've seen yeah inside your mind and if uh you see multiple times a single face that's

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:38.160
 that's a bad sign and and they they could they could uh you use uh different clothes yeah uh

1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:45.040
 but they didn't have was face masks yeah the CIA does nowadays they can give you a different

1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:56.320
 face with within seconds yeah so how I mean again you talk about paranoia uh

1:26:56.320 --> 1:27:06.080
 um is that part of the is that a big part of the job uh counter surveillance like being constant

1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:11.040
 paranoid that you're being watched yeah I was supposed to isn't that quite stressful so is that

1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:16.240
 is that one of the is that actually an effective way to operate nobody it sort of becomes a routine

1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:24.400
 I was told to do it uh while in the US once a month and uh okay it's like a cleaning out oh not

1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:30.800
 not every day no no no no no once a month or before I would say mail a letter with secret writing

1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:39.280
 so I was sure that you know nobody saw me put an envelope into uh post box so this is one of the

1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:43.920
 tools in your toolbox so there's morse code there's yes the decryption and the encryption there's the

1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:51.520
 counter surveillance photography and making making micro dots you know what a micro dot is

1:27:51.520 --> 1:28:02.080
 well that's uh that's uh you use you take a photograph and you use a microscope in reverse

1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:10.880
 and make that photograph really small so small that it's like the the head of a pin

1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:16.240
 that can be used to to hide under a postage stamp

1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:24.160
 um and reality I knew how to make them but in reality they they never asked me to to make

1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:28.960
 use of that technique so it's a sort of an encryption mechanism for photographs

1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:36.800
 yeah so what we do nowadays and embed uh code in in uh PDFs and stuff like that right yeah

1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:42.640
 beautiful okay all right so that that was a learning a training process both in the physical space

1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:49.680
 and sort of um yes algorithmically is there other things oh yeah you bet uh interestingly enough the

1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:58.560
 I was um the first book I was given to read was the history of this uh these communist party of the

1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:04.160
 soviet union oh so understand yeah that's interesting because you said you had to read western

1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:10.000
 literature yeah that too how much how much reading so history how much history of politics

1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:17.680
 geopolitics not culture but they made me read that document uh other than that I wasn't supposed to

1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:22.320
 study the soviet union I wasn't supposed and that that was not and I didn't when they sent me to

1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:28.400
 Moscow it wasn't to learn russia russian right it was to learn english um the the second document

1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:34.240
 they gave me was the the constitution of west Germany and then I got lots of magazines and

1:29:34.240 --> 1:29:42.240
 stuff like that uh as I told you I was uh also told to uh watch west german television which I

1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:50.240
 which I uh embraced with a vengeance because it was better than east german so I would get up

1:29:50.240 --> 1:29:55.120
 in the morning and have a little breakfast and watch the german version of sesame street

1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:02.240
 and that that that helps you um that helps you get an understanding of the culture because

1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:08.880
 if you have to do any kind of uh interaction yes kind of spying then you have to be in be able

1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:14.000
 to effectively integrate well you you also have to know like and that would have been easier uh

1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:19.280
 if I they had sent me to west Germany you know all the soccer teams you know stuff that everybody

1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:23.840
 knows when I came to the u.s. I knew very little stuff that everybody knows that's why I had to

1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:30.560
 be very cautious and you know take it in over time anyway uh and the the last thing I want to mention

1:30:30.560 --> 1:30:40.960
 is uh they I was strongly encouraged to uh expand my my cultural education in other words

1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:51.120
 go to visit museums uh go to the theater uh not so much movies uh opera read read books

1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:57.040
 from all kinds of authors uh that was important to them and once a month I had to write a report

1:30:57.040 --> 1:31:03.680
 what I did but the interesting thing there was not a there was no curriculum there was no agenda

1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:09.200
 there were no checkmarks it was all ad hoc you know now you do this and then you do that uh

1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:16.800
 and uh and a lot of this also they relied on my initiative again I mean that's part of the

1:31:16.800 --> 1:31:22.640
 evaluation too you bet uh are you able to have creative it's interesting that they're like developing

1:31:22.640 --> 1:31:28.640
 a James Bond type of character here which is what what's the reason for the opera as you become

1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:34.480
 yes cultured in a certain kind of way where perhaps that makes you uh more charming more

1:31:34.480 --> 1:31:38.960
 charismatic in terms of your ability to integrate yourself in different situations you absolutely

1:31:38.960 --> 1:31:53.760
 right I I was I was uh when I came to the U.S. after about two years roughly I was cultured enough to

1:31:55.440 --> 1:32:03.760
 not uh make a bad impression at a diplomatic soaray in Washington DC I mingled freely

1:32:03.760 --> 1:32:09.760
 yes all right and and and so the whole idea was for me to sort of reach into the upper

1:32:10.960 --> 1:32:16.960
 realms of society where the targets would be juicier than you know the worker bees

1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:27.440
 and how did you end up in Moscow why yeah what is that journey well so I uh I told you and I

1:32:27.440 --> 1:32:33.680
 started studying English so I started back from scratch you know I went they paid for a tutor

1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:39.200
 and I went from like English 101 and then I went through that in a couple of months then and then

1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:45.440
 I got another guy with whom we I expanded this we had conversations rather than working from a

1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:54.560
 textbook and I and I worked like a maniac I threw myself into the study of of of uh uh English like

1:32:54.560 --> 1:33:01.280
 you wouldn't believe um and and my inspiration came from Vladimir Lenin I had read somewhere in a

1:33:01.280 --> 1:33:09.920
 book that when Lenin was in exile he studied German and he learned 100 German words every day new

1:33:09.920 --> 1:33:15.760
 German words so I started reading newspapers and every word that I didn't know I wrote down on an

1:33:15.760 --> 1:33:24.960
 index card uh German English and I piled them up and so I really learned 100 new English words every

1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:32.160
 day I know this because I counted them and I had a system how to do this uh so you take your index

1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:39.360
 card and you have five categories there's a really good way to learn wrote by wrote uh so you got

1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:46.720
 category one that's the new ones and you got category five so you start with uh with five five

1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:53.200
 you already had to write four times if you have it right again it goes up great it goes into the

1:33:53.200 --> 1:34:01.920
 archive oh like long term cold archive yeah four if you get it right it goes to five if you get

1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:11.280
 wrong it gets relegated to three so and so you go through this and um and occasionally I would

1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:19.840
 throw the archive things back into one so I really I really acquired a phenomenal vocabulary

1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:24.240
 when I was done with my English my vocabulary was significantly higher than the average American

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:30.720
 because I I didn't discriminate whatever word I didn't know I learned which is not necessarily

1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:37.520
 the best way because you know English has a lot of synonyms right yeah and uh and one synonym is

1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:45.520
 usually the preferable one and and I uh when I first interacted with people I very often used

1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:52.080
 the one that wasn't as good and people found that I you know I have an interesting way of talking

1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:57.120
 they didn't know what that meant but yeah what so it builds a good foundation for a language it's

1:34:57.120 --> 1:35:01.120
 getting a large vocabulary yes it's a really interesting there's something I do which is

1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:05.120
 called space repetition which is a programmatic way of doing this kind of system that you've

1:35:05.120 --> 1:35:12.640
 developed yourself which is if you successfully remember a thing it's going to be a longer time

1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:19.360
 before it brings it up to you again yeah now that requires a computer to keep track of the

1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:23.920
 information if you have cars that's a really interesting pile system one two three four five

1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:29.840
 you upgrade it one two three four five maybe I wouldn't go to the archive and go to them to

1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:36.880
 to pile one right away maybe I would go to like I don't know pile five perhaps is probably the

1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:41.360
 right place to put it because because you have to go to that full step again but that is a really

1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:47.280
 powerful way to learn definitely language but also facts like people that go to medical school

1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:53.600
 disconnected fact yeah and and you pretty much when you're done you know what you know yeah you

1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:58.160
 don't have to then again to use it to integrate it into the music of language that's more difficult

1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:03.120
 that's where you're talking about exactly right there there's a charm I mean maybe it's not good

1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:10.800
 for spy craft but there's a charm to this kind of to having an accent and using words incorrectly

1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:17.520
 but confidently there's a because language isn't a simple formula language is the play of words so

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:26.640
 actually using the incorrect synonym you know as it uh you know if instead of saying I'm cold

1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:33.120
 saying I'm chilled yeah something like using off beat words can actually be part of the charms

1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:38.240
 that's interesting if you can learn how to use that correctly because I have no bunch of people

1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:42.080
 with the Russian accent and I feel like they get get away with saying a lot of ridiculous

1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:48.960
 shit because they're able to sort of leverage the charm of the uh non sequiturs by the way

1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:55.200
 by the way just one one thing um you talked about using a computer when I had my first personal

1:36:55.200 --> 1:37:01.520
 computer I actually wrote a program that does that it does that by the way when was that one

1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:07.120
 because you were a world class programmer for a time you're a very good programmer

1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:13.680
 when when did the first PC was probably 1984 1984 when did you fall in love with programming

1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:19.680
 when I went to college in the U.S. and part of the core curriculum was that you were required to

1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:26.960
 take a course in computer and it was mostly just you know talk but we also had to learn a language

1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:33.360
 we had to write some programs in Fortran which was what five at the time it was a

1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:43.600
 uh it was a dumbed down Fortran but listen so I I see the ability I see what what you can do with

1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:51.840
 this I programmed a sine curve and then I divided the the sine curve into really really small

1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:59.680
 rectangles and then ran the program and it came up with the right area wow this is great

1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:06.320
 it's incredible it's incredible it's so powerful it's uh you're creating you're creating a little

1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:11.600
 helper yes helps you understand the world to help you analyze the world and so on uh we'll

1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:15.520
 return to that because it's interesting okay so you have so many interesting aspects to your life

1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:22.240
 but Moscow so yeah no let me let me know let me how I was sent to Moscow okay so one day I had a

1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:30.640
 visitor from Moscow uh and he came to visit me in my apartment uh together with uh Nikolai and he

1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:35.600
 you know we talked and then he said so how's your English I said I pulled a book from the shelf and

1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:43.040
 says I can read that without the help of a dictionary oh that's interesting and he said

1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:49.040
 you know what I'm we're gonna send you a tape recorder and you just talk say something you

1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:55.520
 know for 20 minutes whatever you want to talk about uh they sent this thing and two weeks later

1:38:55.520 --> 1:39:04.640
 I was on a plane to Moscow because yeah I also spoke English so that the British variety of

1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:12.080
 English with not a strong German accent because I've always had the ability to imitate others

1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:19.200
 and sounds there wasn't an innate ability I would uh you know when when when we were in a lab

1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:26.800
 and as students I would very often do uh monologues uh imitating East German comedians

1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:32.480
 you know I just impressions yes yes I'm not good enough to to make a living out of it but

1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:41.360
 that raised some interest and so when they sent me to Moscow there was a first time on a plane

1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:48.800
 by the way um and uh I had a conversation with two ladies who spoke English one was a Russian

1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:55.920
 a professor at Lomonosov University she was obviously KGB there was a cover and the other one

1:39:55.920 --> 1:40:01.920
 was an American born lady oh by the way she was an actual professor using that as the cover or is

1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:08.560
 it just a story no I she said she was a professor she may have taught there too that's an interesting

1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:13.840
 distinction yeah one is like a story you tell people no and one is like you legit are doing the

1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:21.280
 thing but also yeah as a couple anyway that's that's an interesting interesting aspect of how

1:40:21.280 --> 1:40:27.680
 to be a good liar you might you might as well live the lie yeah exactly right uh so uh and the other

1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:34.240
 one was a middle aged the the Russian was pretty young the other one was middle aged an American

1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:40.880
 and uh and so we talked for maybe a couple of hours and then they withdrew and I was left alone

1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:50.240
 eventually my my liaison he came back in and he said it was close but the American things you can

1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:57.920
 actually uh become you get close enough to become becoming a native speaker of American English

1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:06.400
 and he said the Russian was very doubtful and so I think wishful it was a tie literally wishful

1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:17.520
 thinking prevailed so uh within a couple of weeks I was moving to Moscow and what what was the task

1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:24.720
 in Moscow and what and how long were you in Moscow two years and what was the task there

1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:32.000
 is a training or is it espionage no it was training it was so it was I the the American born became

1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:42.080
 my tutor I met with her twice a week uh I uh I also listened to a lot of BBC shortwave BBC

1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:48.640
 worldwide I read more English books so a lot of that was about the language and the culture of

1:41:48.640 --> 1:42:00.160
 English American and and I did phonetics exercises nice every night I had a tape that was about

1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:07.520
 a half hour long and they would say a word and I would repeat the word say a word repeat the word

1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:14.000
 and it was it's mostly about the vowels by the way most of the accent and uh particularly

1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:19.680
 let's say coming from German into into English but also Russian it's the vowels we're talking about

1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:26.160
 the so you would have a single word a word apple and you would just say apple yes and

1:42:26.160 --> 1:42:31.920
 American English or British English no American English and and I give you one uh example that

1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:39.680
 almost nobody gets right the difference between hot and hot you know yeah you know

1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:46.000
 hot and hot yeah and in German speakers it's very you know which one uh for everyone is different

1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:51.600
 for example uh I could say this on the podcast something that my brother struggles with I struggle

1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:57.120
 with too when I first came to this country learning English is there's differences there's embarrassing

1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:04.800
 differences uh like beach and bitch right and you get so as a young kid also you get so nervous

1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:11.200
 that I don't want to say the wrong thing I um I can also say that this is almost as a jokey thing but

1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:18.240
 there's a there's a famous philosopher Emmanuel Kant and you can guess which other word is very

1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:25.120
 similar to that so there's there's a nervousness about the what is that that's interesting I mean

1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:32.000
 in Germans probably have a different uh tension of like what is hard to learn the difference

1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:36.320
 between the pronunciation of the vowels or the control of the vowels yeah it's interesting

1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:41.520
 so you had to really master this daily exercise and you know and and this this was my discipline

1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:48.960
 I did this every night routine boring as hell uh so English was the focus and I also had interaction

1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:56.080
 with some agents who had operated in the United States as diplomats on on a diplomatic cover

1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:02.560
 they would come and talk to me a little bit and tell me and and sort of prepare me what was ahead

1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:07.520
 of me and then I did a whole lot of operational training particularly surveillance detection

1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:13.760
 that was big I also they also taught me how to drive a car in Moscow finally one skill you need

1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:18.720
 what's all surveillance detection okay so this is what when when you find out whether you're being

1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:27.200
 followed ah got it got it got it so it's the end to serve the the the abbreviation that's used in

1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:33.760
 yes in intelligent circles as str surveillance detection route you know when they say that you

1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:41.600
 know what that is and and that was it and a few other things you know one offs for instance

1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:51.040
 uh I was once uh taught uh to read silhouettes of ships when you see a ship from a distance

1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:58.000
 what kind of a ship it might be they they thought this would come in handy actually they

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:07.280
 they uh there was in in 1982 andropov started a campaign was uh now I forget the name operation

1:45:07.280 --> 1:45:13.120
 something something where everybody who was in the west was supposed to look for signs that the

1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:21.840
 west was getting ready for a war and I had an everybody had an object to uh to pay attention to

1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:33.760
 I had a harbor and military harbor in in New Jersey near red bank it was called Earl weapon

1:45:33.760 --> 1:45:42.240
 station and this code name for that was early so they asked me to just wonder by there to see if

1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:47.760
 there was something unusual going on because the Soviet Union were at that point it was Ronald

1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:53.760
 Reagan were really afraid that Reagan was going to start a war they were absolutely 100% afraid of

1:45:53.760 --> 1:46:00.160
 him is there something memorable to you on a personal level on a philosophical level about your

1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:05.520
 time in Moscow something that kind of stays with you outside of the training stuff maybe

1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:10.240
 like the details of the train you love the answer you will love the answer uh

1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:22.400
 I was uh I was given tickets to two performances by americans uh there was a theater troop that

1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:29.680
 played our town uh and then there was this I forget the name of the guy but uh you may not

1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:38.480
 be old enough have you ever watched he ha uh maybe uh there was a it was a country music show real

1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:47.200
 kitschy but uh the star of he ha uh was giving a concert in Moscow and I guarantee you at least

1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:59.440
 half the audience were kgb oh man and at the other end the uh um the the the opposite of uh of a

1:46:59.440 --> 1:47:10.000
 highlight was my visit to the uh to to my to the mausoleum where linen is still still today

1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:18.400
 there there was so there was a nothing you know he was he was my hero but he he looked

1:47:18.400 --> 1:47:24.880
 like a wax figure and and and you walk by there there was nothing inspirational not not there

1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:31.680
 was not a religious experience nothing it was it was a big old nothing is that did did your

1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:38.400
 faith and belief in communism start to crumble at some point here is that around that was still

1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:45.040
 pretty strong what I did notice that the standard of living in in in Moscow was significantly lower

1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:54.080
 than in East Germany the uh uh in the supermarkets uh you could you could expect uh with reliability

1:47:54.080 --> 1:48:01.040
 that you can find uh canned fish and uh mineral water everything else was whatever and if you saw

1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:06.480
 a line and at a store you just line up you don't even ask what they have because if you don't like

1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:14.800
 it somebody else will it was it was uh not poverty but it was close to poverty there were a lot of

1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:23.680
 drunken men in the streets and uh this is the 80s no this is the late 70s late 70s mid to late 70s

1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:30.240
 and uh and also the they had these high rise apartment buildings that looked pretty good

1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:36.960
 from the front but you went into the backyard ouch you know yeah you're describing my childhood here

1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:44.080
 okay okay sorry uh but it's interesting even even with the professor even with everything else um

1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:50.320
 it's interesting because I think the standard of living was much lower you're right even in Moscow

1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:55.920
 yeah absolutely was though the one thing that they always had at least in my days was in those two

1:48:55.920 --> 1:49:02.160
 years there was always fresh bread and the bullets now yes yeah always yeah that's probably one of

1:49:02.160 --> 1:49:10.320
 the memories I have of childhood is well you're hungry a lot but when you eat is bread yeah and

1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:17.120
 the bread was good it was good I mean I don't I I actually wonder I wonder how good it was but I

1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:23.120
 remember it being incredibly good to me it was really good and and you know you had it from

1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:29.200
 white to very dark and and all the varieties the other thing that was good was um if you knew where

1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:40.320
 to get it Stalichnaya was four rubles not only is a good vodka but it's a cheap vodka I like it

1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:44.560
 yeah but you had to know where the you know this would be like holes in the walls someplace

1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:49.440
 well I think a lot of the way they operate I don't I wonder if he's germany's this way but a lot of

1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:56.480
 the ways that Moscow operates is you kind of you had to know yes like there's a very kind of

1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:04.000
 if you make the right friends if you give money to the right guy the guy the friend of the friend

1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:09.200
 of the friend is going to hook you up and this there's a culture that this is how you work around

1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:15.280
 a very big bureaucracy underground economy yeah underground economy yeah you have to which is a

1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:25.600
 boy such a stark contrast between between that and the United States the capitalist system

1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:34.640
 yeah that was a very big culture shock to me to understand the different way the different

1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:38.400
 fundamentally different way of life but the interesting thing is

1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:45.120
 human nature pervades both systems and there's something about the Russian system

1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:50.240
 that reveals human nature more intensely because of the underground nature of it

1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:56.320
 because you get to deal with greed and trust and all those kinds of things in the United States

1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:01.760
 there is much more power to the rule of law so there's rules and people follow those rules

1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:07.200
 they get to break the rules nonstop well in in East Germany and Russia I believe

1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:13.360
 theft if you could get away with it was part of your economic activity yeah

1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:21.120
 yeah I have a friend you know who I went to school with up until my fourth year and

1:51:21.680 --> 1:51:26.400
 we reconnected and he told me how he survived you know he would you know he would just steal

1:51:26.400 --> 1:51:32.800
 stuff and then sell it and or trade it yeah theft I mean it's a relative concept you know

1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:40.960
 you are taking stuff bribery all those kinds of things people you know corruption you know

1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:46.000
 it's a relative I'm just kidding I mean it is you have to work around the giant bureaucracy

1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:51.440
 about the the giant corruption corruption builds on top of corruption and it just becomes this

1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:59.680
 giant system that's unstable as you talked about one last word yes the two years in Moscow

1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:10.560
 taught me how to be alone I had no social interaction not with friends not with women

1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:18.080
 no I was the only interaction I had was with the folks that trained me so I was alone there was a

1:52:18.800 --> 1:52:25.920
 lonely two years for a person who who loves love yes but that prepared me for my first

1:52:25.920 --> 1:52:32.080
 year and first and second year in the United States because I could not interact socially

1:52:32.080 --> 1:52:37.280
 without giving away that something was wrong with me I had to learn how to be an American

1:52:37.280 --> 1:52:43.600
 they didn't teach me in Moscow they couldn't so if the first two years in in America you had to

1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:49.440
 kind of listen more than tell you you bet the very first year I couldn't even work because I had to

1:52:49.440 --> 1:52:56.960
 acquire the docking documents and social security card and a driver's license to get a job and then

1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:05.120
 when I had the job I worked as a bike messenger that gave me a good opportunity to listen as

1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:12.400
 as you know because these people they they weren't really very curious about me what was your name

1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:18.240
 in East Germany what was your name in Moscow what was your name in America okay so my the name I

1:53:18.240 --> 1:53:26.800
 was given at birth is Albrecht Dietrich nobody so sexy when you speak in German accent I hated that

1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:33.200
 name the Albrecht I didn't like it it was it was very rarely used my mother named me after a

1:53:33.200 --> 1:53:41.840
 famous German painter Albrecht Dürer my cover name in Moscow was known as Dieter and in the

1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:47.840
 United States I became Jack Barsky in between I used a whole bunch of other names that were

1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:56.160
 associated with false passports that I used one of the names and I remember is William Dyson

1:53:56.160 --> 1:54:02.080
 because that is the name that was on the Canadian passport I used to enter the United States

1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:06.160
 so how did you enter the United States can we take the journey from Moscow to the United States

1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:14.880
 what was the assignment what was the what was that leap what was like what just one one one thing

1:54:14.880 --> 1:54:23.200
 in between I had a three months practice trip to to Canada that was that was a good idea and I got

1:54:23.200 --> 1:54:29.920
 to tell you this this one thing that happened there okay so because you know the one one thing

1:54:29.920 --> 1:54:35.360
 that I like to tell people nowadays is the one of the secrets to happiness is the ability to make

1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:40.560
 fun of the worst situations that you're in yes you see the humor yes okay so here's come here

1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:47.520
 comes something quite humorous in hindsight at least one of my the task that I had in in Canada

1:54:47.520 --> 1:54:55.680
 was to acquire a birth certificate but the name the name was Henry Van Randall who was born some

1:54:55.680 --> 1:55:01.920
 place in California and I was supposed to you know write a little letter saying I'm Henry Van Randall

1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:10.880
 please send me a copy of my birth certificate the fee is enclosed and and and I lived in a small

1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:17.520
 hotel so the return address it wasn't visible there was a hotel that was important so and it took

1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:25.840
 like three weeks and I get nothing four weeks I get nothing eventually I got annoyed and I

1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:35.120
 mustered the courage to call them up from itself from a payphone I called up the office

1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:41.120
 registrar whatever they were called in this in this town in California and I and I yelled at them

1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:47.360
 I said you got my money where's my birth certificate well a couple of weeks later it came so I see

1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:55.840
 the envelope this is the Henry Van Randall yes I had prepared the caretakers of the of the hotel to

1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:02.720
 that I'm expecting a letter from my friend so I went up to my room I opened it and I was like

1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:09.360
 yes yes this is success and and I opened this thing and it was it was a copy of a birth certificate

1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:15.920
 but it was stamped with big letters across and read deceased now think about it so here's a

1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:23.200
 debt people who's asking for that person who's asking for a birth certificate I had the presence

1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:28.640
 of mine to to leave okay I went to a couple of other cities I should have left the country

1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:36.160
 but I know that the Royal Mounted Police was following me and I was given that information

1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:42.800
 by the FBI later on and they were you were able to oh you were able to at least suspect that

1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:48.720
 at the time I would through the the the I knew that I knew that there was trouble so

1:56:51.680 --> 1:57:00.000
 my counter surveillance route SDR yes didn't discover anything so I kept on going I had to

1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:06.560
 supposed to I was supposed to visit two more cities and they were always one step behind

1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:12.240
 what what what is interesting to me is that they didn't catch me on the way out you have to show

1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:20.720
 your passport to the airline I mean I was I was known by name I would then the path because I had

1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:28.080
 to give that to the hotel right and I escaped with that so how did they do yeah they would have to

1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:36.960
 keep you on a list right yeah yeah that's interesting but that requires like a good computerized

1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:46.560
 updated yeah and this was Swiss air so well you got lucky yeah part of life is luck you bet so so

1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:58.080
 and and other than that the the trip to Canada was a big success because it it gave me the culture

1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:05.520
 shock that that I needed to not be blown out of out of the water and when I get get to the United

1:58:05.520 --> 1:58:12.240
 States so you hopped a few places in Canada and then Swiss I even had a I even had a relationship

1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:22.720
 with a young lady Canadian French Canadian regular Canadian French Canadian and she she gave me a book

1:58:23.360 --> 1:58:28.400
 Winnie the Pooh because we went to see the movie and then she wrote the dedication she says to the

1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:39.200
 nicest German I've ever met was she lying no or you don't know speaking of spy craft and that

1:58:39.200 --> 1:58:51.040
 that led to heartbreak too no that was sexual I was not at that point ready for love no ready to

1:58:51.040 --> 1:58:58.480
 return to that old well I was I was already already married in Germany okay that woman I loved we

1:58:58.480 --> 1:59:08.000
 should return to this yeah so Swiss air where did you land in the United States oh when I came

1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:17.120
 where did I land I American Airlines and a flight from Mexico City to Toronto but they made me

1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:22.960
 deep plane in Chicago I have no idea I think this was over engineering that didn't make any sense to

1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:30.160
 me you know why can't the Canadian just take a take a flight from Mexico City with this stop over

1:59:30.160 --> 1:59:35.440
 there's kind of nonsense yeah but okay but nevertheless that was it and then you landed in

1:59:35.440 --> 1:59:42.080
 Chicago right and tell me the story in America what was the day to day life now this is now

1:59:42.080 --> 1:59:50.880
 your spy your no no no I got to tell you another funny story yes so this is another there's two

1:59:50.880 --> 1:59:56.800
 things that happened that could have ended my career as a spy right then and there so I'm

1:59:57.520 --> 2:00:08.640
 so I'm arriving in in the Chicago in the evening it's already dark I had no idea what kind of

2:00:08.640 --> 2:00:16.320
 hotel to take you know I picked one out of out of yellow pages and then got a taxi when I gave him

2:00:16.320 --> 2:00:22.480
 the address he looked at me like a little funny whatever what do I know you know just keep on

2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:29.760
 going I need to get I need to get sleep because I was extremely tense you know having gone through

2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:37.040
 customs and border control so and we were going in the southern direction and I noticed that the

2:00:37.040 --> 2:00:44.080
 neighborhoods were became less and less inviting didn't didn't know what that meant either I get

2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:52.080
 into the hotel it was a five story brownstone and something else looked funny so the reception desk

2:00:52.080 --> 2:01:00.800
 was protected by plexiglass not having enough background I didn't know that this was unusual

2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:05.280
 because all I knew that there was a lot of crime in the United States so I thought maybe

2:01:05.280 --> 2:01:11.360
 every hotel was like that so I go up into my room and drink a half a bottle of Johnny Walker red

2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:18.640
 because as one does yeah because I was so damn tense I just wanted to sleep I wanted to get into

2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:25.600
 a coma which I did and and the next day I woke up with a head it was twice as big as felt twice

2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:32.080
 as big but you know I was prepared I had aspirin with me so I killed the headache and went outside

2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:38.240
 to see if I can get something to eat and so I was right smack in the middle of the south side

2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:43.200
 of Chicago I didn't know that the south side of Chicago existed I found later I found out where I

2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:54.320
 was so it was time to go very quickly go up there and at that point I decided I would I would register

2:01:54.320 --> 2:02:02.560
 at the next hotel on the Jack Barsky so I went to the bathroom and I tried to kill

2:02:02.560 --> 2:02:10.720
 kill off Mr. Dyson by burning his passport unfortunately I was not trained in how to

2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:18.640
 train passport how to how to destroy passports it was so I tried to burn it and these things

2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:25.520
 or flame retardant and it created a cloud of smoke and I'm looking up there and there's a

2:02:25.520 --> 2:02:31.600
 smoke detector yeah oh no okay so presence of mind I threw this thing in the toilet

2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:35.840
 and then then took out a pair of scissors and cut it into small pieces and flushed it down

2:02:36.640 --> 2:02:43.680
 if that smoke alarm goes off I'm busted right if somebody if if some some criminal steals

2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:49.920
 I had $6,000 on me and cash steals either my passport or my or my money or both

2:02:51.200 --> 2:02:54.480
 I don't know what to do yeah you can't go to authorities you can't do there weren't there

2:02:54.480 --> 2:03:00.400
 weren't any Russian dudes Soviets in Chicago do you have any contacts no there was no there

2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:08.000
 was no there was no plan B for Chicago at all that's an oversight I shouldn't I shouldn't

2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:15.280
 have gone to Chicago they they could have shipped me into San Francisco or Washington DC because

2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:24.480
 both of them had Soviets my end goal was was to go to to New York fine you know I would have been

2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:30.240
 a really really dangerous agent if I had gone back and worked with a KGB because I could have told

2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:38.960
 him all the things how to do it right so in that sense there is some given the scale of the KGB

2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:45.600
 there is some incompetence in this some a lot of with regard to preparing me to be an American

2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:50.080
 as it was almost total incompetent and that do you think that's representative of the way they

2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:59.680
 operate is there's an incompetence like to the logistics to the strategies involved all that

2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:05.520
 kind of stuff yeah they none of these guys had operated as illegals they they were outsiders

2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:11.600
 to American society they had interaction with Americans and but they all lived in you know

2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:16.400
 in New York they lived in their compound in northern Manhattan where they all lived together

2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:22.320
 with their families and and they most of the time they spent interacting with with themselves

2:04:22.320 --> 2:04:27.200
 with their own people at work so they really didn't integrate well they did not know what

2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:34.000
 it's like to be an American to have a job to to you know live like an American they didn't know it

2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:39.440
 it's interesting that KGB didn't put a high value to that kind of integration they didn't know what

2:04:39.440 --> 2:04:45.440
 they didn't know yeah and and by the way this was mutual do you think the CIA had had good

2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:52.480
 knowledge of the Russian culture uh same thing and so there was a lot of lack of understanding

2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:58.400
 because good good intelligence could have possibly avoided some of the high tension that

2:04:58.400 --> 2:05:05.120
 situations that we had when when in the 80s we got close to nuclear war so good intelligence

2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:10.160
 would be integrating yourself in society yes much much and understanding that Ronald Reagan

2:05:10.160 --> 2:05:15.360
 was not a warmonger but he was talking about the end times because he was a a Christian

2:05:16.240 --> 2:05:20.960
 but then that kind of integration can be dangerous because you start to question the

2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:27.200
 propaganda the narratives that on which the KGB is built oh yeah the CIA is built and and then

2:05:27.200 --> 2:05:32.080
 they they have always have had the options of ignoring the intelligence that they're getting

2:05:32.080 --> 2:05:38.400
 right yeah well let me ask you this question sort of to jump around there is a lot of conspiracy

2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:43.840
 theories in this in this current climate I mean throughout history but now especially

2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:52.480
 and some of the conspiracy theories put a lot of power in the hands of the intelligence agencies

2:05:52.480 --> 2:06:02.000
 like CIA, FSB, Mossad, MI6 they're basically the conspiracy theories go that they control

2:06:03.360 --> 2:06:10.080
 the powerful people in this world and they're able to thereby manipulate those powerful people

2:06:10.080 --> 2:06:17.040
 and manipulate the populace in order to deliver different kinds of messages and so on given your

2:06:17.040 --> 2:06:23.760
 experience with this kind of tension between competence and malevolence would you say there's

2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:29.840
 some truth to those conspiracy theories? Not one way I think I think there is there's

2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:36.800
 collusion there's collaboration but I would think that like for instance some folks in

2:06:36.800 --> 2:06:43.920
 the CIA and the FBI are being used by the ones that are really in power power's money power's wealth

2:06:46.880 --> 2:06:52.880
 I know power's not it can go both directions you can acquire wealth first which leads you to power

2:06:52.880 --> 2:07:01.040
 or you can acquire power first yeah power is also knowledge I understand and in a position in the

2:07:01.040 --> 2:07:05.680
 society in the military or in intelligence but I don't think it's a straight one way that all

2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:10.480
 the intelligence agencies control the powerful people in their country you see what's happening

2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:20.160
 in Russia I mean Putin dominates his intelligence agencies right? Well so the question is which

2:07:20.160 --> 2:07:25.840
 way the direction goes be you're saying that there is it's not one way flow of power I would

2:07:25.840 --> 2:07:33.360
 think so and I also believe it exists but it's not as prevalent as you know not every conspiracy

2:07:33.360 --> 2:07:39.280
 theory pans out and most of them don't they're just damn rumors but it doesn't mean they don't

2:07:39.280 --> 2:07:43.040
 exist I guarantee you that they exist there's collusion there's people getting together

2:07:43.680 --> 2:07:52.320
 and not necessarily preparing a specific action but more sort of a plan to go forward

2:07:52.320 --> 2:07:58.000
 and maintain the position or even you know strengthen the position that they already have

2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:06.320
 so KGB Buchen generalizes FSB CIA do you think a KGB agent would kill someone against international

2:08:06.320 --> 2:08:16.080
 law if they were ordered to do so so we talked about they did they did and there's a there's a

2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:25.680
 famous case of one but I think it's Vasily Kuklov who defected he was a killer he was a train killer

2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:33.760
 and he had had done assassinations in other countries he was sent to west Germany to kill a

2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:39.600
 defector a KGB defector and he decided not to do it he talked to the guy and he said I'm supposed

2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:45.600
 to kill you I'm not and then then he eventually wound up in the United States I have a connection

2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:51.920
 to this fellow because the KGB once asked me to go to California and see if the guy still lives and

2:08:51.920 --> 2:09:04.880
 works there and we I found him and we looked at each other so it was an active KGB agent

2:09:05.600 --> 2:09:11.520
 looking at a man that he didn't know was the KGB defector looking at each other neither one knew

2:09:11.520 --> 2:09:19.920
 who the other one was I found out later but he was able to survive yes and you know there

2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:28.720
 there have been assassinations not not a lot and you know that that we know of the good point

2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:36.800
 this is very difficult the the the question is how many lines are intelligence agencies

2:09:37.600 --> 2:09:45.680
 willing to cross to attain to achieve the goal I I think none of these agency

2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:54.400
 you sees have the ultimate line I think eventually they the last line will be crossed if they believe

2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:59.440
 it's necessary well I think you can justify a lot of things especially in this modern world

2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:04.960
 with nuclear weapons that you can justify that you're saving the world actually let me ask

2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:08.320
 a few difficult questions and we'll jump back to your time in America but

2:10:08.320 --> 2:10:17.360
 Vladimir Putin has been accused of ordering the poisoning and assassination of several people

2:10:17.360 --> 2:10:24.320
 including Alexander the Vdenenko early on all the way to Alexei Navalny do you think these

2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:32.160
 accusations are crowded in truth and we will return to a couple more questions maybe above

2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:37.440
 Vladimir Putin's early days in the KGB which would be interesting yeah there's a there's a

2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:44.160
 phrase that I like to say in responses called plausible deniability I don't think Putin gave

2:10:44.160 --> 2:10:49.760
 a direct command as they do that he would just maybe muse it would be nice if something would

2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:56.800
 happen and then somebody picks it up and does it is there can you steal man the case

2:10:57.680 --> 2:11:04.320
 that Putin did not have direct or indirect involvement with who would know who would know

2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:10.800
 you know just well the international the reputation perhaps

2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:19.520
 perhaps catalyzed by Putin himself is that he is the kind of person that would directly or

2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:26.240
 indirectly make those orders perhaps the case there is he's somebody to be feared and thereby you

2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:37.920
 yeah yeah sure but the act itself the the the poisoning of Litvinenko and oh and then the

2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:45.440
 the assassination of the Bulgarian Markov and with a with the umbrella and and they all

2:11:45.440 --> 2:11:56.400
 directly traced back to Russian Soviet intelligence and so that's enough to be feared right um my

2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:02.320
 answer that I gave you is an educated guess you know like I can't pretend to know this for sure

2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:06.560
 but it's frustrating to me because there's a lot of people listening to this would say

2:12:06.560 --> 2:12:15.920
 they would even sort of would chuckle at the naive nature of the question but if you actually

2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:20.960
 keep an open mind you have to understand what is the way that intelligence agencies function

2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:27.920
 is it possible to the head of an intelligent intelligence agency not to make direct orders

2:12:27.920 --> 2:12:32.800
 of that kind where there's a distributed now the head of the intelligence agency would

2:12:32.800 --> 2:12:38.480
 most likely give the order even though it's compartmentalized yeah but but but but not the

2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:46.480
 the head of state not maybe not the head of state although uh in the case this is the case in the

2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:51.760
 United States as well but certainly is the case in Russia there are close relationships between the

2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:57.520
 head of the FSB and the GRU and personal relationships not just even the head of the FSB

2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:07.920
 who is known jail there's interesting details especially uh coming out recently around the

2:13:07.920 --> 2:13:16.160
 war in Ukraine so let me actually ask about the war in Ukraine all right what is your analysis of

2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:24.560
 the war in Ukraine from 2014 to the full on invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022 in February 2022

2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:36.880
 what there's many questions we could ask one is what are the sins of the governments involved

2:13:37.520 --> 2:13:47.360
 what are the sins of Russia Ukraine America China are those sins comparable

2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:54.880
 core the good guys and the bad guys I was more than one question let me just uh give you my

2:13:55.520 --> 2:14:03.920
 the basics about this savvy observers saw this coming they were very small minority

2:14:05.120 --> 2:14:11.840
 because Vladimir Putin was pretty open about what he told the world his mission was was the

2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:18.400
 reestablishment of a strong Russia the reestablishment of something like the the Russian Empire to

2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:28.000
 unite all the Russian speaking people in under one country and the world ignored him I mean he

2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:34.720
 was open what was there was at a conference in France I believe when it we he set this out in

2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:42.560
 the open and then what we had in the United States we had wishful wishful thinking you know

2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:51.440
 Obama had this reset with Russia you know we all get friendly and then when when uh Putin invaded

2:14:52.160 --> 2:14:59.280
 Crimea we did nothing so and it and it just escalated slowly but surely

2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:07.280
 it was pretty clear and then they said uh it was I think two years ago there was an essay

2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:12.800
 published by uh Putin whether he wrote it or not doesn't matter but that was also out in public

2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:20.720
 where he was again quite clear what he was going to do now how do you do this with force and uh

2:15:21.760 --> 2:15:26.720
 and the the sins committed by the American government was that we ignored it we were in

2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:33.840
 gauge and wishful thinking and we didn't stop it with sanctions before the shooting started

2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:40.480
 to push back I don't think you're fully describing you are describing the sins of the Russian

2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:45.120
 government and Putin I don't think you're fully describing the sins of the American government

2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:52.560
 here because not only didn't you're doing you're describing miscalculation so not only did they

2:15:52.560 --> 2:15:59.680
 not pressure correctly with sanctions and so on and and and clearly respond to the actual

2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:04.640
 statements and the essays and the words spoken I know where you're going but keep on yes but

2:16:04.640 --> 2:16:13.840
 they also at the same time pressured pressured Russia and they also as as Putin himself said

2:16:13.840 --> 2:16:23.040
 sort of there's a rat and they pushed the rat towards the corner by expanding NATO and uh and

2:16:23.040 --> 2:16:33.840
 arming Ukraine and well the military industrial complex is a machine that uh that led us um and

2:16:33.840 --> 2:16:40.400
 I think a lot of younger people I mean when I came to this country and this is the country I love

2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:50.320
 of I lived through 9 11 I lived through the full roller coaster of emotion yeah I'm a

2:16:51.360 --> 2:16:57.760
 at that time before that and after it was a proud American I went through the whole roller coaster

2:16:58.320 --> 2:17:06.640
 of uh being sold a I would say a lie about the reason to invade Iraq and even Afghanistan

2:17:06.640 --> 2:17:14.400
 and I've got to live through understanding of this military industrial complex that leads to the

2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:22.640
 expansion of empires of the delusion that we have in the populace in in the government

2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:32.000
 that convinces us that we are the good guys and somehow with military force we can instill our

2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:37.360
 values and still happiness the pursuit of happiness that all men are created equal these ideas

2:17:37.360 --> 2:17:44.880
 in into other lands and we can do so with drones and we can do so with weapons and we can do so

2:17:44.880 --> 2:17:52.640
 without significant cost or our own from our own pockets and so this idea this machine doesn't

2:17:52.640 --> 2:17:57.760
 just apply to Afghanistan and rock it doesn't just apply to Yemen and Syria it doesn't just apply

2:17:57.760 --> 2:18:03.280
 to China it also applies to Ukraine it also applies to Russia agreed and two thoughts if I make

2:18:04.480 --> 2:18:11.600
 first of all one does not hear the term military industrial complex in the public discourse these

2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:19.120
 days Eisenhower warned about it Eisenhower was a capitalist he was the president of the United States

2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:27.520
 so it exists and it is very powerful the more weapons you can sell the more you have to replace

2:18:27.520 --> 2:18:35.840
 them or send over you have to replace them so yes the the other thing is there's also a messianic streak

2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:46.640
 that powers American foreign policy we want to make the world just like us why don't they get it

2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:52.320
 because they don't want to it's almost like it's not communism but it's a very similar

2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:58.640
 romantic idea that we can make the world then fashion the world the way we are and and and

2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:04.560
 that's the romantic side and the sort of honest side but it doesn't work it should it failed every

2:19:04.560 --> 2:19:11.760
 time right you know Afghanistan is a royal mess and would never become a functioning democracy

2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:19.600
 I don't know if if Ukraine can become a functioning democracy so well I don't know if American weapons

2:19:19.600 --> 2:19:27.120
 can help Ukraine become a functional democracy I yeah absolutely right but there's a huge amount

2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:33.840
 of interest in seeing the world in black and white and selling the story of the world is black

2:19:33.840 --> 2:19:43.520
 and white that Ukraine is the symbol of democracy in this east eastern European world and Russia is

2:19:43.520 --> 2:19:51.840
 the symbol of authoritarian dictatorship and the story is not so simple as as as many indices show

2:19:51.840 --> 2:19:57.360
 Ukraine and Russia are the number one and the number two most corrupt countries in Europe

2:19:57.360 --> 2:20:04.000
 they're two peas in a pod one is bigger and and and one is in this case the aggressor now

2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:11.520
 you know two peas the aggressor is still ultimately responsible and the person that

2:20:11.520 --> 2:20:17.360
 throws the first punch now there's a lot of people going to disagree where the punch came from yeah

2:20:17.360 --> 2:20:27.360
 but there is there is magnitude yes and and the struggle by Ukraine for sovereignty stretches back

2:20:27.360 --> 2:20:32.480
 to the beginning of the 20th century stretches back even further than that but there's been

2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:40.720
 the Ukrainian people or proud people and they've been in many cases tortured by those that sit in

2:20:40.720 --> 2:20:48.640
 the Kremlin throughout the 20th century the the famine in the early 30s and it's always it's never

2:20:48.640 --> 2:20:54.560
 the middle class in the upper class that suffer it's always the lower classes the peasants right

2:20:54.560 --> 2:21:01.280
 in that time that this history stretches back far and this is yet another manifestation of that

2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:10.960
 and there's a lot of interest to play China watches closely Russia America watches closely

2:21:11.920 --> 2:21:16.320
 and there's an extra caveat here that there's nuclear weapons at play as well exactly

2:21:18.320 --> 2:21:26.320
 and it's what this is the situation is as dangerous as I have lived through in my entire

2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:33.520
 life I believe and because it's not necessarily at the highest point of escalation but it will be

2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:39.680
 in my view a protracted crisis and the longer that crisis lasts the more of a chance there is

2:21:40.640 --> 2:21:49.200
 of an accident yeah one rocket yep there seems to be a strong incentive to prolong to do siege

2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:56.960
 tactics to prolong this conflict over perhaps many years which is terrifying to think about yeah

2:21:56.960 --> 2:22:05.280
 and over that one a single rocket can lead to given that there's leaders that might not that

2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:12.160
 might be losing their mind yeah and Ukraine is not part of NATO the thing I'm really afraid of

2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:20.640
 of is that somebody might think it's a good idea but for Russia so Putin might think it's a good

2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:27.600
 idea for Russia to send a message by launching a nuke against Ukraine because they're not part

2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:34.320
 of NATO so surely the West is not going to respond what is the West going to do yeah if

2:22:35.280 --> 2:22:41.440
 if Russian nukes Ukraine to send a message I don't know if anyone knows the answer to that

2:22:41.440 --> 2:22:48.480
 question but it's a terrifying question and and I don't know the exact protocol that needs to be

2:22:48.480 --> 2:22:56.720
 followed to to launch a nuclear strike from from NATO's end because we have several countries in

2:22:56.720 --> 2:23:03.280
 NATO that have nuclear weapons so for let's say for France to fire a nuke does the United States

2:23:03.280 --> 2:23:09.360
 have to agree or how does I don't know how that works I don't know if anyone knows how that works

2:23:09.360 --> 2:23:17.600
 yeah I worry now we have different very kind of anecdotal perspectives on these things but

2:23:17.600 --> 2:23:22.160
 if the people have interacted with in the DOD Department of Defense in the military

2:23:22.960 --> 2:23:28.640
 there is a compartmentalization there is a bureaucracy and within that giant bureaucracy

2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:36.160
 there's incompetence we'd like to think that there is like really well organized for really

2:23:36.160 --> 2:23:42.000
 important things there's going to be the best of the best in the world that's going to execute

2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:47.280
 on the correct decisions both geopolitically militarily all that kind of stuff and I've seen

2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:53.840
 enough to know that competence at any level of government at any level in the military is not

2:23:53.840 --> 2:24:00.080
 guaranteed let's go back to the law of hierarchy the the government is is the biggest hierarchy

2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:07.520
 there is and so invariably politicians find their way to the top and once you have politics and

2:24:09.600 --> 2:24:17.920
 dictating substantive decisions they're they're going to be weak or wrong it's I don't I don't

2:24:17.920 --> 2:24:23.920
 know how how this could work any other way there well right now we have some functional idiots

2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:30.880
 in the central United States government well let me because you did you said that I think

2:24:30.880 --> 2:24:36.720
 elsewhere you said that Putin was not a good KGB agent that's right mediocre one but

2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:42.320
 is an excellent politician yeah and a good organizer he was known as a really really

2:24:42.320 --> 2:24:52.240
 good organizer when when Yeltsin hired him as a prime minister he he cleaned up the mess to

2:24:52.240 --> 2:25:02.160
 because Yeltsin was under Yeltsin Russia deteriorated tremendously and it became sort of a mix of an

2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:08.880
 oligarchy and a criminal enterprise and chaotic so he had skills that made him a good executive

2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:17.440
 absolutely now let's go back to him as a KGB agent he was a KGB agent I mean you know according to

2:25:17.440 --> 2:25:23.040
 him once a KGB agent always a KGB agent but 16 years let's say something like this

2:25:25.600 --> 2:25:33.760
 what do you think about from your experience now you're maybe a same age as him approximately the

2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:40.800
 same age as him he's a little younger a little younger yeah what do you think about the KGB

2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:48.480
 experience he had made him the man he is what aspect of that from your own experience yeah well

2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:53.840
 how much that does that define you who you are how you think about the world how you analyze

2:25:54.720 --> 2:26:00.000
 the geopolitics of the world how you analyze human nature now I gotta tell you one thing he's he

2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:06.640
 had a different type of training than I did mine was one on one and he went to school to so to speak

2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:19.600
 so right so but but fundamentally he was not a top agent then this is very simple to there's

2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:26.080
 only one one thing you need to know he knows German pretty well so he was where was he deployed

2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:31.360
 in East Germany not in West Germany not in Switzerland not in Austria that's where they

2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:38.400
 sent the best right when we think generally we're learning here right so this is your

2:26:38.400 --> 2:26:42.960
 classification of where they send the best you know there's people classify all kinds of stuff like

2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:47.040
 what is the best university in the world what is the best football team in the world

2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:52.480
 you start to get a sense the good guys get sent the the best athletes get sent to

2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:58.480
 well we disagree on this but the football team is but you have a sense and you're saying that the

2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:02.880
 best agents would have been sent one would think so now this is not a forcing argument but

2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:13.200
 I also have it from from a word from the horse's mouth which horse I mean what kind of horse what's

2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:19.600
 the breed of the horse you know who Oleg Kalugin is and he's still he's still alive he was at one

2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:26.720
 point the head of counter intelligence for the first directorate espionage right and Putin was in

2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:34.560
 the first directorate and reported to Kalugin for a while and Oleg told me to my face that Oleg was

2:27:34.560 --> 2:27:41.200
 not an impressive that agent trainee or agent what that Vladimir Putin was not impressive not

2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:49.360
 impressive at all now he's biased given this current situation and well yeah you know he could

2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:54.000
 still make it up because he had this big ruckus when when he was in parliament and called called

2:27:54.000 --> 2:28:00.880
 Putin the war criminal about the war in Serbia not only could he make it up I wouldn't trust his

2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:08.240
 analysis I mean I have to you know what when people I've been working very hard even before

2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:13.120
 this war to try to understand objective analysis of all the parties involved you have to really

2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:22.880
 keep an open mind here to see clearly to understand if you are to try to help in some way make a better

2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:31.920
 world in this case stop this war yeah or have all the countries involved flourish bring out the

2:28:31.920 --> 2:28:37.680
 best the people remove the corruption and the greed and the destructive aspects of the governments

2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:44.400
 and let the people flourish for all that you have to put all the biases aside all the political

2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:56.480
 bickering all the I don't know all the biased analysis and there's there's a lot of propaganda

2:28:57.280 --> 2:29:05.040
 that says that in fact Putin was it was a good agent how else would he rise to the ranks right

2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:12.480
 because he was a good politician and he had made a lot of good connections and with with

2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:19.840
 in the KGB allow me to say something you just you just taught me a lesson and and and the lesson

2:29:20.640 --> 2:29:26.560
 I should have figured out myself because I keep on telling people that in the intelligence world

2:29:27.120 --> 2:29:32.480
 you never know the truth 100% so when you said oh I could make that up of course you could have

2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:40.000
 but you get to a point where you're forced to make a decision or have an opinion and then

2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:47.120
 you use your best educated guess yes so I'm I'm going to take the certainty of the statement that

2:29:47.120 --> 2:29:52.160
 I made back yes because you it's quite possible that you're right well what I've noticed about

2:29:52.160 --> 2:29:56.320
 Vladimir Putin and this is true about for example Donald Trump and all those kinds of

2:29:57.680 --> 2:30:04.720
 divisive figures that some for some reason people's opinion on the details of those people are very

2:30:04.720 --> 2:30:12.000
 sticky once you decide this is a bad guy yeah there's like like a black hole and people are not

2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:19.440
 able to think like one act at a time you don't have to like that doesn't somehow justify this

2:30:19.440 --> 2:30:25.840
 this somehow doesn't uh remove all the evil things that are done but you can analyze clearly

2:30:25.840 --> 2:30:32.240
 each of the actions and to me it is interesting to see how did this man rise through the ranks

2:30:32.240 --> 2:30:41.680
 now you're saying that to be a KGB agent there's a lot of skills involved and perhaps raw

2:30:43.680 --> 2:30:51.600
 technical skill of spycraft is perhaps not related to the skill of raising rising through

2:30:51.600 --> 2:30:57.760
 the ranks right and you're saying as a politician he was good at rising lying and influencing

2:30:57.760 --> 2:31:05.920
 uh that is something that that is significant as a significant talent and ability that an

2:31:05.920 --> 2:31:14.960
 agent must have that helps you as a politician continuing the kind of thread of the role of

2:31:14.960 --> 2:31:24.960
 KGB in defining the the heart soul and mind of latimer putin let me return to Yuri bismetov who

2:31:24.960 --> 2:31:31.120
 was a soviet kGB agent that wrote a four step framework for ideological subversion on a national

2:31:31.120 --> 2:31:39.440
 scale as practiced by the soviet union so the the four steps are demoralization destabilization

2:31:39.440 --> 2:31:45.440
 crisis and normalization he had a lot of other kind of systematic ways of describing this kind of

2:31:45.440 --> 2:31:54.640
 stuff so can you speak to some of these ideas about the systematic large scale ideological

2:31:54.640 --> 2:32:04.560
 subversion goals of the kGB is there truth to that kind of those ideas yes but i i think i

2:32:04.560 --> 2:32:10.800
 already sort of mentioned that i think besmanov was a fraud and i have i have again can you

2:32:10.800 --> 2:32:18.880
 elaborate good good arguments let's put it this way first of all we we know that the kGB was

2:32:18.880 --> 2:32:30.800
 involved in active measures which is you know you can call it fake news yeah seating fake news into

2:32:31.920 --> 2:32:38.560
 advert in the countries that are your adversaries and and the russians have been doing this lately

2:32:38.560 --> 2:32:44.480
 by meddling in our election and and focusing on the left and the right fringe and influencing

2:32:44.480 --> 2:32:52.400
 them to become more left and no more right so that and uh in vasili mertrocan uh has and has

2:32:52.400 --> 2:32:59.280
 an in one of his books uh he has a whole chapter about active measures okay so what he has to say

2:32:59.280 --> 2:33:04.400
 about the department and i forgot what department that was was the one department that was the least

2:33:04.400 --> 2:33:12.800
 desirable for kGB agents because these were desk jobs for people who had to come up with uh fake

2:33:12.800 --> 2:33:20.560
 stories that uh in countries where they didn't quite know too much about the country now there

2:33:20.560 --> 2:33:28.160
 were some successes like one of them the two uh most famous successes uh that i'm aware of is that

2:33:29.440 --> 2:33:37.360
 the canard that the AIDS virus was concocted in a cia lab and there's a lot of people around

2:33:37.360 --> 2:33:44.160
 the world believe that and the other one was that uh jad kahoover was a secret cross dressers

2:33:44.720 --> 2:33:50.800
 cross dresser that that was that that is still known by a lot of americans who over a certain age

2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:57.760
 that this was the truth but uh mertrocan actually traces it back to a story that was placed in a

2:33:58.560 --> 2:34:05.200
 sort of left wing but close to mainstream uh french magazine and it was then taken taken up by

2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:14.560
 uh more uh you know larger newspapers and and well established papers so so they had some

2:34:14.560 --> 2:34:25.520
 successes but this kind of a uh massive well thought out campaign to destabilize the united

2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:32.800
 states i don't believe the kGB was capable of doing that mertrocan seems to agree with me

2:34:32.800 --> 2:34:38.880
 me i was trained i would think you know i was one of the crown jewels of their agents

2:34:39.760 --> 2:34:46.960
 one would think that they used the best that they had to to help me how to become an american

2:34:46.960 --> 2:34:52.480
 and they didn't have a clue so how do they if you don't know how a country operates how do you come

2:34:52.480 --> 2:35:00.080
 up with with this this this kind of a very detailed uh long term plan that's that's also

2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:04.400
 timed you know two years this and when you're that and all that yeah so we should we should

2:35:04.400 --> 2:35:11.600
 actually just clarify so he he has this whole idea that there is a 15 to 20 years i needed for

2:35:11.600 --> 2:35:20.640
 demoralization yeah um where you're um you're basically infiltrating a country from a young

2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:25.440
 or people from a young age manipulating their mind you're destabilizing then that's the second

2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:31.280
 step that takes two to five years you uh target the country's foreign relations defense and economy

2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:37.280
 you create a crisis artificially and then you normalize it as as if it always was this way

2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:45.360
 so it's basically saying that the kGB is capable of at scale uh over many years

2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:54.000
 manipulate an entire population of people right and this is kind of um

2:35:54.000 --> 2:36:00.640
 um there's a lot of people that believe in conspiracy theories that are amenable to this

2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:08.080
 kind of idea now my own experience is that there is in fact just a giant amount of incompetence

2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:14.160
 and then this is something that's actually very difficult to pull off because yes it's incredibly

2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:23.360
 um incredibly difficult to achieve this kind of manipulation i think it would it would require

2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:30.560
 first of all not much bureaucracy not much slowing down you have to have incredible

2:36:31.280 --> 2:36:36.720
 in modern world digital systems that are able to do surveillance manipulation there has to

2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:43.040
 be a strategy that is carried out in secrecy across a huge number of people effectively

2:36:43.040 --> 2:36:50.640
 that also requires you hire the best people in the world and i think it's difficult to execute on

2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:59.040
 this kind of thing with if you compartmentalize because there has to be great collaboration

2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:05.920
 there has to be a great where there's a unified vision coordination and coordination across

2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:12.560
 multiple groups there has to be i mean there it's very difficult to do now nevertheless

2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:17.920
 especially with technology this becomes easier and easier so the bar becomes lower and lower to

2:37:17.920 --> 2:37:24.000
 achieve mass surveillance becomes easier and easier and easier mass manipulation through

2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:29.200
 platforms because we're now digitally connected you can now do that kind of manipulation so it

2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:34.800
 becomes more and more realistic that you could do this kind of thing but you're saying that no

2:37:34.800 --> 2:37:43.440
 intelligence first of all intelligence is hard and to do it at scale and to do it well and to do it

2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:50.080
 in a way that it's also not just collecting information about the populace but manipulating

2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:55.520
 the populace is very very difficult right now let me now give you another argument where i think

2:37:55.520 --> 2:38:03.680
 that besmanov was a fraud uh i mean i already have i have uh matroken on my side and and my

2:38:03.680 --> 2:38:10.960
 personal observation of the incompetence that i witnessed i mean they really really didn't know

2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:17.600
 what they didn't know so now besmanov was kgb where was he stationed in india

2:38:19.040 --> 2:38:27.520
 he he was a low level agent in india and i told you was the one thing that the kgb was really

2:38:27.520 --> 2:38:34.400
 good was at was compartmentalization how does besmanov in india find out about this massive

2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:41.600
 plan that should have been super secret right he made it up sorry yeah and and you know why he got

2:38:41.600 --> 2:38:46.640
 away with it because americans eat that up because it's not our fault it's like the damn russians

2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:51.760
 that doing doing all that that bad stuff speaking of the damn russians doing all that bad stuff

2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:58.400
 if you know about the internet research agency they have been doing quite a bit of damage and

2:39:00.160 --> 2:39:07.840
 i i'm now familiar with the world of enhanced artificial persons these are the avatars

2:39:08.400 --> 2:39:17.440
 on facebook and twitter and you know so forth that look like real people and and and and there are

2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:24.160
 quite a few of them and and i have a good friend who operates in in that realm and you know he he

2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:32.560
 uses for instance facial recognition when he thinks that there's a suspicious character say on

2:39:32.560 --> 2:39:39.920
 linkedin or or on facebook and very often he finds out yeah that that person exists but it's not the

2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:48.000
 person who it pretends to be so basically detecting the artificial yes enhanced artificial yes but

2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:53.360
 but he can also make them you think the united states hand in hand yeah united states doesn't do

2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:58.720
 it we do it too but uh well this is to push back against your pushback right yeah besmanov might

2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:05.680
 be a fraud uh huh but is it possible especially in the modern age that there is these kind of

2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:16.080
 of large scale systematic opera wouldn't you as a government more so uh that's investing

2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:25.040
 billions of dollars into military equipment uh in in a world that's more and more clearly going

2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:34.240
 to be defined by uh cyber war versus hot war but wouldn't you start to have serious meetings

2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:40.960
 as large amounts of hires yeah that are working at how do we manipulate the information flow

2:40:40.960 --> 2:40:47.600
 how do we manipulate the minds of the populace how do we sell them a narrative um so even though

2:40:47.600 --> 2:40:53.200
 he might have been making up a story because people eat it up could it speak to some deep

2:40:53.200 --> 2:41:00.000
 truth that's actually different than the the truth you came up in as a kgb agent i agree with you 100

2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:07.280
 percent is much easier when uh you know all you need is is an army of nerds who also know no feds

2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:15.680
 no feds nerds that's a term of endearment i love i love nerds i used to be one myself

2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:23.440
 but anyway once a nerd always a nerd so you know uh so what i was gonna say here is all you need is

2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:32.720
 an army of nerds and and what but also uh experts in the culture of the target country okay and and

2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:38.240
 nowadays the world is different there's a whole lot more fluidity there's a whole lot of more people

2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:43.440
 that like say russians for instance study in the united states chinese an army of chinese study in

2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:49.520
 the united states they they have a lot more knowledge of how we function than the kgb did

2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:57.840
 and it's vice versa uh not as many americans in in russia but we have some but the chinese and the

2:41:57.840 --> 2:42:04.560
 russians have an advantage here can i ask you a question based on your experience so i have been

2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:14.080
 talking to a lot of powerful people and some of which have very close connections to in this

2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:20.240
 particular conflict uh ukraine and russia but in other places as well i don't believe i've

2:42:20.240 --> 2:42:29.360
 ever been contacted by or interacted with an intelligent agency cia fsb mi6 massage i don't

2:42:30.480 --> 2:42:36.240
 think i had well let me say explicitly i haven't had an official conversation which is what i

2:42:36.240 --> 2:42:41.840
 assume i would have because i have nothing to hide right so i think there's no reason for people to

2:42:41.840 --> 2:42:51.360
 be secretive but would i why why is that would i know am i interesting at all how how are people

2:42:51.360 --> 2:42:57.600
 determined if they're in person of interest or not and i guess the question i mean some of it i asked

2:42:57.600 --> 2:43:04.720
 in a bit of a humorous way but also perhaps there's truth in some of the humor is what i know if i

2:43:04.720 --> 2:43:12.800
 have ever interacted with a intelligence agency spy well you you don't know that you haven't

2:43:12.800 --> 2:43:21.120
 been contacted uh but but certainly not uh you i think you you never had a conversation that

2:43:21.920 --> 2:43:26.240
 related to intelligence in any way shape or form right right like where a person another person

2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:32.960
 introduced yeah the decisions themselves or you know becomes sort of wants to be your friend and

2:43:32.960 --> 2:43:43.680
 then uh talks about these types of topics right yeah but i um there's people because because of

2:43:43.680 --> 2:43:51.120
 who i'm interacting with they're i mean even we just even with elon musk like if you think about

2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:59.520
 elon musk there's a lot of people that are um that are part of the conversations that happen

2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:04.480
 how do i know they're all trustworthy they all present themselves as trustworthy now again i

2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:09.600
 have nothing so this is this is for the intelligence agencies have nothing to hide i'm the same person

2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:17.760
 privately it's publicly um well intentioned uh real no no controlled no weird sexual stuff where

2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:25.040
 you can manipulate me um what else no drug use no drug use no no skeletons in the closet

2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:32.320
 um none of that kind of stuff but you know i don't i don't know i mean just even having

2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:39.440
 these conversations you know i tend to trust people as a default like me too and you start

2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:45.440
 when you think well especially with some of the people i've been talking with

2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:53.760
 and some of the traveling i'm doing i'm realizing there's a you know there's hard men in this world

2:44:53.760 --> 2:45:02.240
 there's military there's serious suffering and there's war and there's serious people

2:45:02.240 --> 2:45:09.760
 that are doing serious harm and so you have to be careful of thinking who to trust was with

2:45:09.760 --> 2:45:15.840
 the person approaches you with a smile and asks you a question um my my natural inclination is

2:45:15.840 --> 2:45:21.920
 that person is a cool person i'll answer the question i'll become a friend but it becomes

2:45:21.920 --> 2:45:26.400
 difficult when you realize that there's um there's things like intelligence agencies

2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:31.760
 with thousands of employees there's people that are doing major military actions that involve

2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:37.840
 tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of soldiers this is serious stuff and so how do i

2:45:37.840 --> 2:45:42.560
 how do you know how to operate in this world the folks that you're interacting with uh

2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:49.600
 have a responsibility not to tell you what they shouldn't tell you right right so and most of

2:45:49.600 --> 2:45:57.040
 them probably won't and and i'm guessing occasionally they will say well i can't go there right yeah so

2:45:57.040 --> 2:46:06.800
 so what what what you are aware of is sort of public and what you're doing is you you uh

2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:15.920
 you're collecting it and you um you editing it to some extent you're not you're not

2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:23.280
 changing the word the verbage yes you you just uh repeat what they say so from that

2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:30.880
 angle you're not you know you're not privy to any real secrets what you uh have possibly

2:46:30.880 --> 2:46:39.200
 that could be of use is you learn to get to know the person so i'm thinking as a good possibility

2:46:39.200 --> 2:46:45.840
 if you get the interviews uh in the east that somebody may actually approach you and ask you

2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:50.960
 what's what's your opinion i just hope they approach me and introduce themselves properly

2:46:50.960 --> 2:46:59.040
 i just yeah there's a kind of i mean would you know like how many russian spies are there in

2:46:59.040 --> 2:47:04.000
 the united states how many american spies are there in russia do you do you have a sense is it

2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:11.040
 no i just like with the gru no idea is it is it possible there's like tens of thousands and we're

2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:17.360
 not we're like thousands not not thousands like i used to operate we were too hard to train and we

2:47:17.360 --> 2:47:24.880
 weren't that successful to begin with but um particularly russians and chinese um you know

2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:34.800
 you know both uh governments know who is going abroad and i guarantee you there's a lot of amateur

2:47:34.800 --> 2:47:39.760
 spies they're they're being asked to you know help us out you know do something for the motherland

2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:46.320
 and we're outsourced spying yeah sort of not not serious training but yeah and yeah for instance

2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:53.120
 uh this this lady uh i forgot her first first name butina she was a rank amateur she used

2:47:53.120 --> 2:48:01.200
 social media to communicate with moscow uh so she had no training but she was reasonably successful

2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:10.560
 i mean she she got uh and and and uh um i the difference between let's say uh the current

2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:19.600
 russian intelligence and the kgb vladimir putin and his his henchmen are okay with people being caught

2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:26.080
 but because and every time i i go and talk and give a talk someplace i i'm always asked this

2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:32.160
 question how do you i mean how many russian spies do you think we have here because that it scares

2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:38.640
 the people right and putin likes to scare people the kgb was very solicitous of uh of the agents

2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:45.360
 they were you know they uh they didn't want any one of them caught right so that's that's a big

2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:50.480
 difference and uh you know so getting caught so for the fsb getting caught sends a strong

2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:54.960
 signal to the world that there's yeah there could be many more and there probably are but

2:48:56.400 --> 2:49:04.800
 and uh because also the world again there's a whole lot more travel going on a whole lot more

2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:12.720
 interaction studying abroad doing business and uh you know there's there will be attempts at espionage

2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:19.200
 probably one every minute in this country that doesn't mean they would be successful no uh

2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:27.280
 but there is a a cottage industry now that is doing quite well that teaches companies how to

2:49:28.880 --> 2:49:36.320
 you know fortify themselves against like industrial espionage or also foreign actors spying

2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:40.800
 it's all over the place yeah as it becomes easier and easier with digital

2:49:40.800 --> 2:49:46.400
 yes with cyber that becomes a serious and a very serious threat we might wind up in a world where

2:49:46.960 --> 2:49:52.720
 nobody knows anymore what's up and what's down if i worse to have a conversation with

2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:59.920
 vladimir putin and or volodomyr Zelensky is there something you would ask

2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:12.080
 about the time in the kjb the time in his past what we are all of us men and women are

2:50:13.520 --> 2:50:19.040
 creations of the experiences we have our life early on in life and through the formative

2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:25.520
 experiences successes and failures so uh yeah you you just said the keywords you know i would ask

2:50:25.520 --> 2:50:31.360
 you know without giving away anything you know just being high level your biggest success and

2:50:31.360 --> 2:50:37.040
 your biggest failure as a politician or as a kjb agent you'll be talking in the realm of uh

2:50:38.320 --> 2:50:48.400
 kjb when the wall came down and uh he was in in an office kjb office in the city of dresden and

2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:59.920
 um east germans were uh besieging uh starsy offices and they also dropped by the kjb office and uh

2:50:59.920 --> 2:51:06.400
 they they were they were pretty threatening it looked like they weren't actually storm the

2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:16.160
 office and get you know the documents and stuff like that and uh initially the first demonstration

2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:26.160
 was uh um was told that uh if they come any closer weapons would be used so they disappeared and then

2:51:26.160 --> 2:51:33.200
 they came back and uh and uh i don't know some somebody in that office called berlin and said

2:51:33.200 --> 2:51:38.800
 what are we gonna do okay are we allowed to use force and the answer came back to gobert schoff

2:51:38.800 --> 2:51:46.240
 said absolutely not and so this is where putin all of a sudden you know he was at one point uh

2:51:46.240 --> 2:51:50.720
 a member of the greatest the most powerful intelligence organization in the world and

2:51:50.720 --> 2:51:58.320
 all of a sudden he was powerless and he had to watch how you know this this was a defeat big one

2:51:58.320 --> 2:52:07.760
 yeah and and it's a supposedly a powerful intelligence agency cowering yeah sort of crawling

2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:13.360
 back into a position of weakness and he probably promised himself never again russia needs to be

2:52:13.360 --> 2:52:23.360
 great again the kjb fsb russia the russian empire needs to rise again and that there's a feeling

2:52:23.360 --> 2:52:29.680
 for him that that's as he talks about the collapse of the soviet union being a great tragedy there's

2:52:29.680 --> 2:52:40.800
 a feeling like that was uh um that was like never again yeah and and i i believe that uh

2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:49.440
 he has a he has a strong conviction uh that i don't know if he's religious he who carries

2:52:49.440 --> 2:52:56.560
 across now but i don't know what that means but somehow but that uh uh it's the destiny of the

2:52:56.560 --> 2:53:03.680
 russian nation to be great and that that is sort of that that's whether there's it's it's determined

2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:10.080
 by god or some some higher power that that is very important for him of course that nationalist

2:53:10.080 --> 2:53:18.640
 idea is uh one that americans share as well and you know it could help a nation flourish so by

2:53:18.640 --> 2:53:24.640
 itself is not necessarily a bad thing it's how it manifests itself is the question um well one

2:53:24.640 --> 2:53:34.240
 other thing is if i were to uh get a chat with the the ukrainian uh president i would ask him

2:53:34.240 --> 2:53:42.560
 how many lives what what what what what is the equation between giving up some land and how many

2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:50.720
 lives uh are worth this land and that's a it's a good way to phrase the question of course that

2:53:50.720 --> 2:53:57.760
 question gets you killed in ukraine but uh because there's another part of that equation which is

2:53:57.760 --> 2:54:07.920
 part of that equation which is it's not just land versus lives it's the sovereignty the the knowledge

2:54:07.920 --> 2:54:14.720
 that you're free and you're self determined and like it's not about like fighting for the particular

2:54:14.720 --> 2:54:27.520
 land it's saying we are messed up corrupt uh we have problems it's a messy world but it's our world

2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:33.920
 i think steven crane has a poem about like a man eating his own heart and uh he was asked

2:54:35.040 --> 2:54:39.920
 how does it taste and he said it's bitter but i like it because it is bitter and because it is

2:54:39.920 --> 2:54:46.800
 my heart and that there's a sense of like i want this is not just about land this is our nation

2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:54.240
 the same love of nation that uh putin has for russia the greater russia this vision of this great

2:54:54.240 --> 2:55:01.120
 empire uh i believe ukraine does as well there not every name you know there's levels to this game

2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:08.080
 and ukrainian people are some of the proudest people throughout the history of the 20th century

2:55:08.080 --> 2:55:14.880
 throughout the history of earth the polish people proud people you can just see in world war two

2:55:15.520 --> 2:55:23.200
 the people who said fuck you you're not having this we will die to the last man though there's

2:55:23.200 --> 2:55:28.560
 different cultures that kind of really hold their ground and ukrainian people are that

2:55:28.560 --> 2:55:34.640
 you know i have to admit in that respect i'm a i'm a bit overpowered i i could not do what

2:55:34.640 --> 2:55:48.720
 stilinski's been doing uh i uh i would sort of try try to find a way to carve out something that

2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:59.520
 i i can live with however if if that force that evil force goes gets to my family right there's

2:55:59.520 --> 2:56:07.280
 lines yes that's right you you become the world's bravest man as somebody crosses that line oh yeah

2:56:09.360 --> 2:56:16.800
 you mentioned something about you've not been to moscow back uh and that you it might not be safe

2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:26.000
 for you to travel there yes um can you speak to the nature of that you know as somebody somebody

2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:36.320
 that successfully got out of the kgb how are you still alive the number of reasons uh first of all

2:56:38.160 --> 2:56:44.880
 when my story became public that was six years ago that was pretty old right and so

2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:52.160
 uh the folks that may have a personal interest or may have had a personal interest in doing me harm

2:56:53.120 --> 2:56:58.640
 most of them don't live anymore all right that's number one number two i i did not uh

2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:07.280
 i wasn't a hired hand at german i did not betray the motherland that's a crime that is uh

2:57:07.280 --> 2:57:18.240
 uh punished by death you'll betray the motherland that's uh and um and you know and the other thing is

2:57:20.640 --> 2:57:27.040
 if there is a you know that these kinds of operations to assassination on a in another

2:57:27.040 --> 2:57:33.760
 country are very difficult to plan and implement and if there's a list of people that they don't like

2:57:33.760 --> 2:57:40.880
 i may not be at the very top having said that you know if i wind up say in moscow or even in

2:57:40.880 --> 2:57:47.200
 countries like turkey where there's a lot of lawlessness you know accidents can easily be

2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:54.080
 arranged and that's just sending another message you know just like you know we we

2:57:55.200 --> 2:58:01.440
 we can do a lot of things powerful yes do you think it's safe for me to travel in russia in ukraine

2:58:01.440 --> 2:58:11.760
 uh i think you uh you know very well how to communicate in both countries you know you've

2:58:11.760 --> 2:58:18.880
 shown this in this interaction that uh you have a lot of empathy for the people you'll be talking

2:58:18.880 --> 2:58:24.080
 with and empathy means good understanding where they're coming from and then there are lines that

2:58:24.080 --> 2:58:29.040
 you can't cross yeah like the question that i was going to ask dolinski you're not going to ask good

2:58:29.040 --> 2:58:34.880
 for you yeah isn't that the funny thing about this world there's lines there's lines everywhere

2:58:34.880 --> 2:58:40.320
 even in love even in personal relationships there's lines you should not cross yeah how did you finally

2:58:40.320 --> 2:58:47.600
 get caught i resigned in 1988 so let's actually talk about that there's a okay yeah resigned

2:58:48.240 --> 2:58:54.320
 there's there's warning signs yeah there's another yet another choice yet another cross roads yes okay

2:58:54.320 --> 2:59:01.520
 what was the calculation what was the choice to be made to give a little background it was 1988

2:59:02.400 --> 2:59:13.040
 and i was i thought they would my my uh my time in the us would soon end because you know i thought

2:59:13.040 --> 2:59:20.320
 10 to 12 years it was already past 10 years there was no indication that they that they indicated

2:59:20.320 --> 2:59:26.720
 you know that they said you know you know we're done you're done but in december of 1988 i got this

2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:37.680
 one one thing that i never wanted to see so we had a system of signals that either one of those

2:59:37.680 --> 2:59:45.680
 diplomat agents could set at a spot that i pass by every day or i could set where they would pass

2:59:45.680 --> 2:59:51.360
 by like on their way from where they live to the united nations for instance who would just drive

2:59:52.000 --> 3:00:01.360
 so and mine was my the signal spot for me was on a on a support beam for the elevated atrean

3:00:01.360 --> 3:00:10.160
 and queens and it was uh morning in december that i walked by there and routinely look at it and

3:00:10.160 --> 3:00:15.120
 never expected anything and there was this red dot it was about the size of my fist with a

3:00:15.120 --> 3:00:22.960
 you know red paint and uh and since you have done it already i can i think i can curse in this uh

3:00:22.960 --> 3:00:29.920
 moment because it's the only way i can really indicate how i felt i said oh shit because that

3:00:29.920 --> 3:00:36.800
 was the danger signal there was like you must you are in severe danger of uh and you need to get

3:00:36.800 --> 3:00:42.240
 out of the country as soon as possible there was a uh a protocol that i was supposed to follow i

3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:48.480
 wasn't even supposed to go home i just needed to was supposed to get my my reserve documents that i had

3:00:49.840 --> 3:00:58.480
 hidden in in a park in in the Bronx and made make a beeline to the canadian border i wasn't ready

3:00:59.280 --> 3:01:04.320
 so i just like ignored this thing i mean i did i couldn't ignore it but i went on to work

3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:11.360
 got on the a train went to work and then went to my cubicle and stared at the computer screen all

3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:16.160
 day because i couldn't think i could think only about what to do what to do what to do the reason

3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:25.680
 for this indecisiveness was that uh i was a father at the time i was uh my my little girl by the

3:01:25.680 --> 3:01:35.920
 name of Chelsea was 18 months old and i was there when she was born i took her to uh

3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:45.600
 uh toward the home i watched her grow up uh i watched her take the first steps and always

3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:53.200
 look at me with these big eyes lovingly look at me and uh that is when i started my reentry

3:01:53.840 --> 3:02:02.560
 into the human race because i just fell in love with this girl that's when love came back

3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:10.800
 and it was completely unexpected and uh there's a lot of fathers who understand you particularly

3:02:10.800 --> 3:02:18.240
 fathers of girls who understand what happened there and i still thought i need to go back

3:02:18.240 --> 3:02:24.000
 because you know there was there was probably some danger but i hadn't figured out how to

3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:29.520
 take care of the girl you know i leave her but you know maybe she she need to she need to have

3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:35.520
 a good life and grow up and and have a chance and her mother had a she was from south america she

3:02:35.520 --> 3:02:45.840
 had a fourth grade education that would have not worked very well so i played for time i obviously

3:02:46.960 --> 3:02:51.120
 i could be sick i couldn't you know i could be in a hospital there was a precedent where i

3:02:51.120 --> 3:03:00.320
 was sick where i couldn't communicate for about three weeks so i just uh did nothing um that was

3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:08.000
 on a monday on a thursday was my regular uh shortwave transmission i listened and they explained a

3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:15.360
 little and and and a few sentences we have reason to believe that the fbi is on your case you need

3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:24.800
 to execute the emergency procedure come home right away i still had some time because the radio

3:03:24.800 --> 3:03:32.480
 could be broken or the transmission was bad or i still could be in hospital right so i gave myself

3:03:32.480 --> 3:03:44.240
 some more time and then something happened where they forced my hand it's the only time that the

3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:52.480
 soviet agent was anywhere near me on the territory of the united states so i'm waiting for the a train

3:03:52.480 --> 3:04:03.120
 on a on a dark morning still and uh in queens and there's this uh man the short man in a

3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:10.240
 black trench coat comes up to me from my right and he whispers into my ears you got to come back

3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:18.080
 or else you're dead i can't imitate the russian accent that was a russian accent so now and it

3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:27.200
 wasn't pretty strong accent the you're dead phrase can have two meanings and an american would have

3:04:27.200 --> 3:04:34.560
 said or else you'll bust it or or else you get arrested or else you're dead is very strong so now

3:04:34.560 --> 3:04:40.960
 you have to have to take it seriously to some degree because i knew that uh they didn't they had a

3:04:40.960 --> 3:04:48.160
 history of uh assassinating or at least trying to assassinate the factor so uh that that obviously

3:04:48.160 --> 3:04:54.160
 that raised the the stakes a little bit uh but i i i just talked myself into believing this was just

3:04:54.160 --> 3:05:02.720
 uh and a bad phrasing and uh but at this point i knew and they knew that we both knew right so

3:05:02.720 --> 3:05:09.120
 there was no more guessing he found me he talked to me i know so now i had to act so in in the next

3:05:09.120 --> 3:05:18.720
 radiogram i was uh asked for uh to execute a dead drop operation where they would give me money and

3:05:18.720 --> 3:05:29.280
 uh passport and there was in a park in on statin island there was a location that i found and i

3:05:29.280 --> 3:05:39.760
 described and then i was always uh praised for my my ability to describe spots that are easy to find

3:05:39.760 --> 3:05:46.960
 so that was that was a given so and the only thing that was different in this for this operation they

3:05:46.960 --> 3:05:54.160
 they scheduled it for the dark all right so but it was still no problem because it was in a park

3:05:54.160 --> 3:06:04.880
 it was in a park and then a couple of about 100 yards in by next to a fallen tree would be hard

3:06:04.880 --> 3:06:13.440
 to miss so i go to statin island and i read the signal that said uh you i i put the container

3:06:13.440 --> 3:06:22.160
 in the drop that that was the protocol there's a signal that the person who uh who hands over

3:06:22.160 --> 3:06:29.360
 was something puts at a spot not too far from the spot itself that means i would go in and just

3:06:29.360 --> 3:06:38.000
 pick it up the reason i actually uh went to pick up this this container because there was money in

3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:44.720
 it so i didn't have to make a decision yet okay i could throw away the passport i it was like i

3:06:44.720 --> 3:06:49.440
 was still trying to figure out what to do what to do what to do so i get to the spot i get to the

3:06:49.440 --> 3:06:56.720
 tree and i had a flashlight with me the park there was nowhere in the park it was even during the

3:06:56.720 --> 3:07:05.040
 day though this park was not uh it was more almost like a little forest um and uh i don't see the

3:07:05.040 --> 3:07:14.240
 container it wasn't supposed to be a crushed oil can pretty sizable not hard to miss and i do a

3:07:14.240 --> 3:07:19.520
 double take and i look again and i look around i look around a little more see if they misplaced it

3:07:20.160 --> 3:07:26.080
 you can't find it that's the only one that one of those operations failed

3:07:28.480 --> 3:07:35.360
 and that just doesn't make a lot of sense so when as i'm walking away from this

3:07:35.360 --> 3:07:47.120
 like sort of numb emotionally i said to myself i'm staying yeah that decision kind of signal some

3:07:47.120 --> 3:07:55.120
 kind of this amuse just spoke to you that decision was made for me now you know that i'm a question

3:07:55.120 --> 3:08:02.240
 now and i think that was like god told me this you know but it was certain there it was right

3:08:02.240 --> 3:08:10.400
 there that that was it that was it and uh so what i did uh uh to uh well first of all i

3:08:12.400 --> 3:08:18.400
 divine intervention helped me to find a find a good explanation i sent them my last letter

3:08:18.400 --> 3:08:26.400
 and with secret writing i uh i communicated to them i said i i wish i could come but i can't

3:08:26.400 --> 3:08:36.080
 because i have uh contracted hiv aids that was the best lie ever because nobody wanted to have

3:08:36.080 --> 3:08:40.720
 AIDS in their country because those days it was a death sentence right and i knew i had we had

3:08:40.720 --> 3:08:46.960
 conversations of when i was back in moscow how they were snickering about what's going on in the

3:08:46.960 --> 3:08:51.760
 united states you know that that depraved culture and you see with them they they're killing each

3:08:51.760 --> 3:08:58.640
 other and the depraved culture took you took over your being and yes no and and i was and i was

3:08:58.640 --> 3:09:05.040
 convincing enough i even traced it back to a girlfriend i had once that i had actually reported

3:09:05.040 --> 3:09:12.800
 on that she you know i i interacted with this lady who had a boyfriend at one point uh who

3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:19.440
 was a drug addict and she was infected and she infected me so they believed it they sent uh

3:09:19.440 --> 3:09:27.520
 and i asked them to give my my dollar savings to my german family uh they gave them some but they

3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:34.160
 they they told they told my family that i already passed away that i'm dead they believed it 100

3:09:34.160 --> 3:09:43.120
 percent and i guess the agent who took the money took half of it for himself so that was it and uh

3:09:43.120 --> 3:09:50.960
 and the the next three months i made sure that i wasn't uh reliably at the same spot

3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:58.720
 in the same time frame so i went to work in different paths at different times just to you

3:09:58.720 --> 3:10:06.560
 know you just do a safety measure so to speak and not not not huge uh but you know i did it

3:10:06.560 --> 3:10:16.480
 it's it it kept me kept my allowed me to keep my sanity uh and and obviously after i sent the letter

3:10:16.480 --> 3:10:23.680
 i i threw the shortwave radio in the Hudson river destroyed the one time paths that i still had so

3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:32.560
 i was now uh ready to uh for a new life for a new life and live out my life as an american

3:10:32.560 --> 3:10:40.400
 undiscovered uh but you know starting to work on my version of the american dream

3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:49.200
 and uh the first action was was telling my wife the mother of this child

3:10:50.160 --> 3:10:56.320
 you know she always said wanted to have a house and said you know what we should buy a house

3:10:56.320 --> 3:11:02.880
 and a year later we moved into the suburbs and then i said we should have another child and

3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:11.520
 we had another child so and i had a career where i did pretty well uh i moved a couple of times

3:11:11.520 --> 3:11:18.080
 we wound up in a mac mansion but before that my second house was actually in pennsylvania and

3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:27.120
 rural pennsylvania and this is uh where uh i was discovered by the fbi and how did they know about

3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:35.760
 me i if it if it hadn't been for this defector basili mitrokin who was an archivist in in the kgb

3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:41.120
 archives he was actually pretty high level he was in charge of the relocation of the archive

3:11:41.120 --> 3:11:52.400
 uh from lew lew bianca to yasenovo um and he really hated the he had reason to believe he

3:11:52.400 --> 3:12:00.080
 hated the the soviet system uh i i think i remember that his son was quite ill and he

3:12:00.080 --> 3:12:05.680
 could have gotten treatment in england and he was not allowed to to travel to england with his son so

3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:13.280
 he his hatred he tried to figure out what to do and how to do damage to that system so he started

3:12:13.280 --> 3:12:20.560
 copying notes little little slips of paper handwritten that he smuggled out in his underwear

3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:27.920
 and in socks over the years and then he transcribed them with a typewriter and then put the the

3:12:27.920 --> 3:12:38.160
 pieces of paper uh into some kind of a container and and and buried this in his dacha it was i

3:12:38.160 --> 3:12:46.480
 believe in 1992 when he showed up that was already the the soviet union was gone so he showed up at

3:12:46.480 --> 3:12:52.400
 the u.s embassy in moscow and told him what he had and it was on a weekend and apparently there was

3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:56.720
 a junior person in charge and he said you know what what you got we are not interested in it's

3:12:56.720 --> 3:13:06.400
 really old uh that's a career limiting move right uh because uh vasily mitrok and then uh made his

3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:17.360
 way to one of the Baltic republics and uh contacted mi6 and they said come on in old fellow we have a

3:13:17.360 --> 3:13:25.120
 cup of tea and so they they managed to get this stuff out of the dacha and get it to england and

3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:32.000
 eventually uh the mi mi6 shared it with the fbi and uh there wasn't a whole lot of information

3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:37.440
 about me it was very very little it was like there's a person by the name of jack borsky who

3:13:38.480 --> 3:13:44.160
 is an illegal operating in the northeast of the united states now if it was jim miller

3:13:44.160 --> 3:13:50.880
 they wouldn't have found me jack borsky was easy to find so they checked social security and jack

3:13:50.880 --> 3:14:00.640
 borsky was uh had gotten his social security card at the age of 33 bingo okay the all they

3:14:00.640 --> 3:14:04.960
 knew though was that i wasn't illegal that i was still living there they didn't know whether i was

3:14:04.960 --> 3:14:11.280
 active inactive uh they and the other thing that they knew that i was a really really well trained

3:14:11.280 --> 3:14:21.200
 agent because i was still there right so um they took uh i think almost three years to investigate

3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:27.520
 me watch me from a distance because you know if i was still active i would would have found out that

3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:33.600
 somebody's investigating so you started being less and less active in terms of oh i stopped

3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:39.360
 completely what i mean is oh surveillance detection yes sir the detection after three months i stopped

3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:46.000
 altogether okay yeah good point and fbi is still very careful they were very careful they they pretty

3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:51.600
 much watched me and then and at one point i had a house in the country with one neighbor at one

3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:57.760
 point that that house was for sale so the fbi bought it and they put a couple of agents there and

3:14:57.760 --> 3:15:06.880
 just keep a closer eye on me uh there was no indication that uh i was still active but they

3:15:06.880 --> 3:15:15.280
 were still cautious and uh but at one point they uh they were able to plant a bug in my kitchen

3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:25.040
 a listening device and uh i my wife and i didn't get along very well you know there was a lot of

3:15:25.040 --> 3:15:30.480
 friction and she was constantly complaining about things and you know i got sick and tired of it

3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:39.680
 and one day we had an argument in the kitchen and then i i chose to deploy the nuclear option

3:15:41.760 --> 3:15:48.880
 and that is that is telling her what i sacrificed to be with her to so she would understand that

3:15:48.880 --> 3:15:54.640
 i am there on her side i'm supporting her if something doesn't quite fit it is not because

3:15:54.640 --> 3:16:02.880
 i don't love the both of them chelsea and and penelope so i when i said that the listening

3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:10.320
 device was active so the fbi was hearing my confession i was once a kgb agent blah blah

3:16:10.320 --> 3:16:17.440
 blah blah blah and and i quit because uh then because of uh and then stayed stayed here because

3:16:17.440 --> 3:16:25.920
 of you and chelsea and um that also made it clear to the fbi that i wasn't active anymore

3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:33.520
 no they had both of that so now uh they knew uh an attempt to turn me would have been useless

3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:39.120
 because you know because you know you turned somebody who's active but they figured they had

3:16:39.120 --> 3:16:48.000
 but there was enough reason to treat me nicely because uh they figured i had a lot of information

3:16:48.560 --> 3:16:54.800
 that was as as aged as it was but it was still important for the fbi to get to know

3:16:55.920 --> 3:17:05.680
 and so one day it was a friday evening i i'm driving back home from the office

3:17:05.680 --> 3:17:17.600
 and i'm being stopped by a um a state uh state state police um as i'm going through the toll

3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:24.560
 oh it's a bridge over the Hudson and then they had to pay a toll and he waived me he got me right

3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:30.560
 where stopped and he said could you please uh move over here it's a routine traffic stop

3:17:30.560 --> 3:17:36.560
 he thought nothing of it i had forgotten at that point that i once was a spy you know like this was

3:17:36.560 --> 3:17:44.400
 gone and uh and then he said could you please step out of the car that should have uh aroused my

3:17:44.400 --> 3:17:51.040
 suspicion that's unusual right routine traffic stop uh yeah i did it no problem and then again

3:17:51.040 --> 3:17:58.960
 somebody came from the right came into my view and he flipped this uh id and i said fbi we would

3:17:58.960 --> 3:18:08.000
 like to have a talk with you now this is uh my now friend joe reilly who who actually is uh the uh

3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:15.280
 he's the godfather of my of trinity my last child but anyway uh he told me later that when when

3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:21.760
 i heard that phrase all the blood left my face it became totally white

3:18:21.760 --> 3:18:30.240
 um but i recovered very quickly and he said it himself so you know he they took me to a vehicle

3:18:31.360 --> 3:18:38.240
 and uh there was another agent in the vehicle and he had a gun strapped to his ankle so

3:18:39.040 --> 3:18:46.080
 that was pretty real first question i had so am i under arrest and the answer was no

3:18:46.080 --> 3:18:55.440
 no and then my instinct kicked in uh in my ability to to operate and very well under

3:18:55.440 --> 3:18:58.800
 high pressure situations and i asked him so what took you so long

3:19:01.280 --> 3:19:10.800
 you know the intent of that was to um to uh defuse any kind of tension

3:19:10.800 --> 3:19:21.840
 and i saw a smile instant friends uh yeah well i i knew i knew that uh i had to make them like me

3:19:23.040 --> 3:19:32.320
 and i'm i think by now i know i'm a pretty pretty likable person so i would say so so uh and i when

3:19:32.320 --> 3:19:40.480
 when they took me to a motel which they had rented there was an uh two two wings at a

3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:47.200
 right angle they they had one they bought all the rooms in one wing and they had a guard at

3:19:47.200 --> 3:19:53.600
 each end of that wing and they took me in the middle and uh there were some props there

3:19:54.400 --> 3:20:01.200
 some binders with labels and i i immediately thought you know this is pretty silly because

3:20:01.840 --> 3:20:07.360
 what what i what i noticed that the own the labels all referred back to my early years

3:20:07.360 --> 3:20:14.400
 i knew that they didn't know much else so um i told joe that afterwards and like that was not

3:20:14.400 --> 3:20:22.000
 a great idea but anyway uh but but i volunteered i made the following statement before we even

3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:28.000
 started the the uh interview i said i know there's only one way for me to and my family

3:20:28.720 --> 3:20:34.560
 to have a chance to get through here without much damages if i'm if i'm completely 100%

3:20:34.560 --> 3:20:42.880
 cooperative and is my intent to do that exactly that all right so we we spent about two hours

3:20:42.880 --> 3:20:48.320
 in the interview they allowed me to call my wife tell her that i'm going to be late that

3:20:48.320 --> 3:20:53.840
 indicated to me already that they would let me go and after two hours they let me go um

3:20:54.720 --> 3:21:01.840
 but they had the area covered with all bunch of people and the head of that that team

3:21:01.840 --> 3:21:09.360
 talked to me and he says if you think of running we got every intersection in this area covered

3:21:09.360 --> 3:21:17.440
 you can't i didn't say anything but you know i had no no thought of running so and that was

3:21:17.440 --> 3:21:24.960
 the beginning of uh another phase of my life where i was cooperating with the fbi for quite a

3:21:24.960 --> 3:21:29.680
 while and living still undercover for several years until i had real good documentation

3:21:29.680 --> 3:21:38.560
 and became an american citizen uh seven years ago uh today seven years ago so recently uh yeah

3:21:38.560 --> 3:21:44.640
 quite recent the bureaucracy took a long time to figure out how to how to make me real and

3:21:46.160 --> 3:21:52.160
 and also not put me in in in these witness protection program you know to keep my name

3:21:52.720 --> 3:21:58.640
 and then just you know make everything like official so for instance i had to change my

3:21:58.640 --> 3:22:08.320
 birth year uh simply because if i jack boski was born in 1944 if i kept 1944 the fbi would have

3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:14.640
 helped me commit a crime because i would have uh collected social security of four years sooner

3:22:15.680 --> 3:22:21.440
 so and anyway uh details of that yes it it took quite a while and when i finally got the call

3:22:21.440 --> 3:22:30.560
 from the office of homeland security uh since the lady says uh this is agent so and so uh

3:22:31.600 --> 3:22:40.880
 from homeland security can you comment to the office tomorrow and i said um let me look at my

3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:46.720
 calendar and then i said wait a minute what am i talking about what time do you want me to be there

3:22:46.720 --> 3:22:52.560
 because i had waited for that moment for a long time and uh i was sworn in right then and there uh

3:22:52.560 --> 3:22:58.720
 it was a good feeling to walk out of there because i i had a country again you know and i love this

3:22:58.720 --> 3:23:03.760
 country just as much as you said you love it uh with all its words and its problems that we're

3:23:03.760 --> 3:23:11.840
 going through right now um and then the last thing that changed my life again and i don't want to

3:23:11.840 --> 3:23:18.800
 get into details because it's a little complicated story i never wanted to be a public person uh and

3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:26.560
 then i was discovered to a number of uh uh dots that were unlikely to be connected i had to do

3:23:26.560 --> 3:23:34.640
 with a relative with with a half brother of my wife who lives in germany uh was taken to uh to

3:23:34.640 --> 3:23:41.680
 uh germany with by his mother who came to visit somebody not us but that somebody that he came

3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:49.440
 to visit uh lived 50 miles from our house and that my my wife and and this half brother never

3:23:50.160 --> 3:23:55.600
 never met in person before they knew about each other through social media and when he found out

3:23:55.600 --> 3:24:03.280
 my background he he was a uh conductor of the german railroad at the time he said oh this is a

3:24:03.280 --> 3:24:09.520
 big story i'm going that's going to be big big big okay well he happened to know this one person

3:24:09.520 --> 3:24:18.560
 who happened happened to know uh uh one of the star reporters of death spiegel and uh after she

3:24:18.560 --> 3:24:25.840
 did some research and determined that i was real she was on my case and she happened to know uh

3:24:25.840 --> 3:24:30.640
 steve croft the guy from 60 minutes is she all these connections i had nothing to do with it

3:24:30.640 --> 3:24:35.760
 that's how life works dots get connected somehow sometimes yeah most of us it doesn't stuff happens

3:24:36.720 --> 3:24:41.280
 get lucky you you don't know what happened a few times in your life uh yeah i think i'm

3:24:42.160 --> 3:24:50.000
 must be part i wish too yeah so uh it's uh it's been it's been an interesting ride

3:24:51.120 --> 3:24:58.800
 um i'm just still shaking my head about all the stuff that happened oh it's been a fun one what

3:24:58.800 --> 3:25:07.200
 you wrote uh because i'm allowed to leave behind a documented legacy of my unusual life yeah i'm

3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:14.480
 praying that the legacy will be described by a single word love so let us return to the thing

3:25:14.480 --> 3:25:21.280
 we started the conversation with which is love yeah what role does love play in this human condition

3:25:21.280 --> 3:25:30.880
 in your life and yeah in our life here together i i give you an answer like telling you what happened

3:25:30.880 --> 3:25:38.480
 one day i i gave a presentation at microsoft headquarters that's a strange beginning

3:25:39.040 --> 3:25:43.680
 story but yes no that's not a love story and then so there's this there's this young this

3:25:43.680 --> 3:25:49.360
 beautiful young lady sitting in the back and she's she's paying a lot of attention found out later

3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:57.680
 that her her her job at microsoft job job title was story teller it's soft marketing right

3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:04.480
 yeah you could say that yeah but but that's if you can't afford somebody like that that's that's

3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:14.240
 good anyway she uh question and answer she raised her hand and she asked me all the things

3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:21.280
 that you have done and you've experienced what's the number one lesson you've taken away from

3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:26.800
 from your life that was a new question for me i never never been asked that question

3:26:27.440 --> 3:26:34.560
 and i i thought about about it for 20 seconds and then i came up with this uh this phrase

3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:45.520
 that we all know love conquers all because in my life it did in the end and uh and it's uh

3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:53.120
 it's the strongest human emotion and that is what makes us human really and you spoke about the i mean

3:26:53.120 --> 3:27:00.400
 offline as i've spoken with you it's it's clear to me how transformative how powerful the life of

3:27:00.400 --> 3:27:07.360
 your children are your your daughters in your life and who you are and and why you think life is

3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:13.680
 beautiful and why you think this country is beautiful now that um that i'm pretty mature

3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:22.000
 to put it mildly uh i'm i'm also more loving towards many more people

3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:28.560
 you know these things like uh random acts of kindness for strangers i do them i'm looking

3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:36.560
 for them now and you know what it's good for me well welcome to texas because this random kind

3:27:36.560 --> 3:27:43.440
 acts of kindness stranger seems to be a way of life which is one of the reasons i love it here

3:27:44.240 --> 3:27:49.760
 it just reminds me why i love human beings which is that they there's just this warmth this connection

3:27:49.760 --> 3:27:59.920
 yeah and georgia is the same thing yeah amen um do you have any regrets do you looking back at life

3:27:59.920 --> 3:28:06.720
 do you wish you've done something different well i i could have but i then i would have had it would

3:28:06.720 --> 3:28:13.600
 have a different regret i betrayed the wife the german wife that i loved i really did love her

3:28:13.600 --> 3:28:22.640
 and i betrayed her but if i don't betray her then i i betray the child

3:28:24.400 --> 3:28:31.840
 that is a source of so much love for you now so maybe life is a kind of um you get to choose

3:28:31.840 --> 3:28:39.840
 your regrets you don't yeah it's a little it's a it's a little bit um of a strange way of putting

3:28:39.840 --> 3:28:47.120
 it but i there's no other choice and i tell you what what i don't regret and and that's

3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:52.480
 that may be you probably understand it now because you have enough background about me i don't regret

3:28:52.480 --> 3:29:00.720
 having lied to my mother because i had no really strong emotional relationship with her she took

3:29:00.720 --> 3:29:10.320
 care of me she was proud of me but we didn't hug we didn't we didn't interact emotionally whatsoever

3:29:11.360 --> 3:29:17.680
 so you don't feel like you betrayed that i love that that uh well i i did i know that i know that

3:29:17.680 --> 3:29:25.040
 she uh she was looking for me uh until she day the day she died she she wrote a letter to president

3:29:25.040 --> 3:29:34.400
 Gorbachev asking him for help to locate me uh she she checked with a stasi she just was

3:29:36.160 --> 3:29:42.320
 like hell bent on finding me and couldn't find me so she passed away without knowing

3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:50.720
 what happened to me now there was this uh this rumor that uh was flying around and she

3:29:50.720 --> 3:29:58.640
 possibly may have bought into that rumor because my cover for uh when i went to the united states

3:29:58.640 --> 3:30:08.160
 was that i uh changed careers again and i joined a an institution in Kazakhstan that did space

3:30:08.160 --> 3:30:15.200
 research in the cosmos something something uh and i had a i had a piece of paper that

3:30:15.200 --> 3:30:21.680
 that uh invited me to start there and it was the it was a forgery that inter cosmos didn't

3:30:21.680 --> 3:30:28.400
 never existed but but people knew that in Kazakhstan there were a super secret uh in

3:30:28.400 --> 3:30:35.760
 facilities so and some one of my classmates old classmates from high school started the rumor

3:30:35.760 --> 3:30:46.480
 that i died in a rocket accident and everybody knew that so when i came back to germany went back

3:30:46.480 --> 3:30:56.480
 to germany i found the telephone number of this girl that had dumped me i called her and i said

3:30:56.480 --> 3:31:06.800
 i said so so guess who this is but maybe you hold on to your chair she says yes i said this is albrecht

3:31:08.240 --> 3:31:14.720
 it's a good payback no we actually met so there's two elderly people in their 60s

3:31:16.000 --> 3:31:24.800
 who meet each other after so many years and uh the one that ended the relationship started

3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:32.000
 the conversation by saying you know what i made a really bad mistake and and the tears

3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:37.440
 came down her cheeks i wasn't asking for that i wouldn't i wasn't happy about it but it did

3:31:37.440 --> 3:31:47.200
 feel good now now uh a while later uh i knew why she said she made a mistake i met her husband

3:31:47.200 --> 3:31:55.440
 yeah i mean there's uh this there's a town ways is a song called martha where he made

3:31:56.560 --> 3:32:01.440
 where an older gentleman calls somebody he's to love and they have a conversation they're

3:32:01.440 --> 3:32:07.680
 both married now and it's sometimes you can meet people from your past and it gives you a glimpse

3:32:08.240 --> 3:32:13.680
 of a possible different life you could have oh yeah and you know i was actually when she said i

3:32:13.680 --> 3:32:20.880
 made a mistake and i was thinking to myself no you didn't there was none there was nothing left

3:32:22.480 --> 3:32:29.840
 there was nothing left uh and also the person that she became uh personality wise wasn't as

3:32:29.840 --> 3:32:37.440
 as attractive as as i remembered her you know it's puppy love you know but still love yeah it

3:32:37.440 --> 3:32:45.200
 was it was passionate love for sure and uh i i would have uh i would have thrown myself under

3:32:45.200 --> 3:32:50.560
 the bus if i could save her it was that strong and just as strong as the love for my two girls

3:32:51.200 --> 3:32:59.680
 yeah life is full of moments and periods like that of love and that's what makes life so

3:32:59.680 --> 3:33:05.600
 so freaking awesome but it does come to an end and so does this conversation i guess

3:33:05.600 --> 3:33:11.440
 yes no this goes on for many more hours but yes uh do you think about your own death

3:33:11.920 --> 3:33:17.680
 huh do you think about death do you think about your own death yes are you afraid of it yes

3:33:18.560 --> 3:33:21.120
 even though i'm a christian uh

3:33:23.680 --> 3:33:28.240
 as a christian do you have a sense what's coming after or is it full of uncertainty

3:33:28.240 --> 3:33:36.960
 i have a hope i have a hope uh you know um there there's a lot of uh there's a lot of christianity

3:33:36.960 --> 3:33:43.360
 which is quite logical a lot of christianity which is also you know the life of christ there's a lot

3:33:43.360 --> 3:33:58.560
 of a lot of proof uh but you know and i became a christian uh starting with a head and and and i was

3:33:58.560 --> 3:34:13.920
 already quite old and i uh you know when you don't when you don't get this faith very early uh it's

3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:20.240
 it's it's tougher to buy into everything you know there are some there are some things that are

3:34:20.240 --> 3:34:26.240
 difficult for me to understand and and believe but but there's many many other things that

3:34:26.240 --> 3:34:33.920
 i can't explain only with the existence of a god but whether he lets us go again for in eternity

3:34:34.960 --> 3:34:42.480
 i just hope i won't convince somebody else at this point which is doesn't make me a really really

3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:49.360
 good christian because i'm supposed to evangelize but there's still a fear yeah there's a fear and

3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:56.480
 a hope uh on the other hand uh i know that you see see this this is this is how i approached the

3:34:57.520 --> 3:35:08.880
 last years of my life uh i will not i will not mentally or physically get the crap it i will

3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:17.760
 do everything i can do to be alert and fit i still run i run four or five times a week

3:35:17.760 --> 3:35:24.960
 and i'm going to start lifting weights again good you stay physically and mentally sharp yes

3:35:26.160 --> 3:35:31.920
 go out with guns blazing that's that's and i once read a book written by a by a medical doctor

3:35:32.480 --> 3:35:40.640
 he said most people uh uh when when when when they're becoming mature that the the rest of their

3:35:40.640 --> 3:35:51.120
 life is a slow downward move and the not for you no the the last years are pretty bad

3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:59.280
 he said you got to do this boom that's that's pretty good advice from a doctor um and if

3:35:59.280 --> 3:36:06.480
 nothing else from christianity uh whichever parts you take on one of the big ones is love

3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:12.480
 yes that's something you've lived from the very beginning before yes before god was part of your

3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:16.400
 life before anything was part of your life it seemed that love was part of your life and

3:36:16.400 --> 3:36:23.920
 was been a consistent threat throughout yes sir and uh there's there's a short sentence in in the

3:36:23.920 --> 3:36:29.520
 bible it says god is love and and the and oh the other thing is i want to say that the christian
