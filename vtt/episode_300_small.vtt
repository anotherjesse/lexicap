 The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan, his second time on the

00:04.640 --> 00:10.000
 podcast. He has inspired me for many years with his conversations to be a

00:10.000 --> 00:16.440
 better and kinder person and has now been doing so as a friend. There's no one

00:16.440 --> 00:22.080
 I would rather talk to on this 300th episode of this podcast on the 4th

00:22.080 --> 00:26.720
 of July, both the anniversary of this country's Declaration of Independence

00:26.720 --> 00:32.440
 and the anniversary of my immigrating here to the United States. A silly kid

00:32.440 --> 00:37.760
 who couldn't speak English, who could never imagine that he would be so damn

00:37.760 --> 00:43.880
 lucky as to live the life I've lived, and to feel the love I've felt from the

00:43.880 --> 00:50.240
 amazing people along the way. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I love you

00:50.240 --> 00:56.040
 all. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our

00:56.040 --> 01:01.960
 sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Joe Rogan.

01:01.960 --> 01:07.760
 Charles Bukowski said something in a poem called Style About Art. He defined

01:07.760 --> 01:12.800
 art saying, style is the answer to everything. A fresh way to approach adult

01:12.800 --> 01:17.360
 or dangerous thing. To do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a

01:17.360 --> 01:21.840
 dangerous thing without it. To do a dangerous thing with style is what I

01:21.840 --> 01:26.880
 call art. What do you think he meant by that? Do you agree with this? A dangerous

01:26.880 --> 01:31.600
 thing with style is art. He said both fighting can be art, boxing can be art,

01:31.600 --> 01:36.360
 loving can be art. Have you ever made love and it was art? No, okay, I'm not asking.

01:36.360 --> 01:43.240
 Every time, bro. Opening a can of sardines can be art. I think there's something to that.

01:43.240 --> 01:48.960
 Yeah, I think I think I call the way people live life art. Like I wrote a

01:48.960 --> 01:54.000
 forward to my friend Cameron Haynes's book and which is right now the number

01:54.000 --> 01:58.080
 one selling audio book in the world. And one of the things that I said was

01:58.080 --> 02:03.480
 that practice is an art that very few people appreciate and it's the art of

02:03.480 --> 02:10.200
 the maximized life and that the discipline that he displays in his

02:10.200 --> 02:16.480
 life and through his practices and all the things that he does, it's so difficult

02:16.480 --> 02:23.080
 to live the way he lives. That for someone like me who understands it and knows

02:23.080 --> 02:29.120
 what he's doing and appreciates it and appreciates how insanely difficult it

02:29.120 --> 02:33.520
 is to have a full time job and run ultra marathons, get up at four o clock in

02:33.520 --> 02:38.000
 the morning, run a full marathon before work. Like that's the kind of shit that

02:38.000 --> 02:45.880
 he does when he's training for these 240 mile runs all at the same time

02:45.880 --> 02:53.680
 being like a father, a husband, having this full time job, also being the best

02:53.680 --> 02:58.400
 bow hunter on earth, lifting weights. It's like how does a person do this?

02:58.400 --> 03:03.440
 So in a way discipline is art too. Yes, it discipline is art. Yeah, I think it is

03:03.440 --> 03:06.800
 because it's beautiful for me to see when I see someone who's really truly

03:06.800 --> 03:11.760
 disciplined, who like a David Goggins, someone who just like truly maximizes

03:11.760 --> 03:16.280
 the grind. I feel like there's an art to that and there's an art to kindness.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.760
 Like there's people that are really kind and really sweet and when I'm around

03:19.760 --> 03:23.400
 them it's beautiful. It's like there's an art to them. No matter what. Yeah. They

03:23.400 --> 03:26.920
 still, they got, you know, the world can throw a bunch of shit at you but through

03:26.920 --> 03:32.160
 all that. Some people are just great at it. Yeah. And it's a thing that you learn

03:32.160 --> 03:37.480
 how to do and it's pleasing for other people to see and that I think is where

03:37.480 --> 03:43.440
 the art is. Well, I think Bukowski also said, and I'm just a Bukowski quote

03:43.440 --> 03:48.960
 generator today. I love him. I love him very much too. He's a dark and troubled

03:48.960 --> 03:52.480
 and fascinating and a weird person, like Hunter S. Thompson. Yeah. He said what

03:52.480 --> 03:57.680
 matters most is how you walk through the fire, I think. So there's a bit of the

03:57.680 --> 04:02.960
 Cannes Haynes in that too, David Goggins in that too. What do you think he meant by that?

04:02.960 --> 04:07.160
 Well, how you walk through the fire, I mean, you can walk through the fire

04:07.160 --> 04:13.240
 complaining along the way or you can walk through the fire and create an example

04:13.240 --> 04:18.560
 for everyone else so that the trials and tribulations of their own life seem

04:18.560 --> 04:22.400
 trivial because they're comparing themselves to the way you handle things

04:22.400 --> 04:28.120
 or the way you handle things with grace and dignity and discipline can show

04:28.120 --> 04:34.040
 other people that they can handle their own life this way and there's beauty

04:34.040 --> 04:38.280
 in that. There really is and there's so much inspiration to be

04:38.280 --> 04:42.440
 gathered from other people. If you're a charitable person, if you're charitable

04:42.440 --> 04:49.920
 and compassionate and you can look at people, even people I don't like, I

04:49.920 --> 04:55.800
 try to look at the best aspects of how they live their life and

04:55.800 --> 05:00.400
 recognize those aspects, admire them, give them credit for it, there's

05:00.400 --> 05:04.680
 something that we can all get out of watching the way other people live

05:04.680 --> 05:08.760
 their lives. So I got a chance to see you walk through the fire a little bit

05:08.760 --> 05:15.880
 privately and publicly this year in January. I got to ask you about that. So

05:15.880 --> 05:20.000
 there's like generic conversations about sort of cancel culture and all those

05:20.000 --> 05:24.880
 kinds of things but as a human being, this to me is fascinating. So there's

05:24.880 --> 05:29.920
 the end word highlight video, there's the criticism of the different guests,

05:29.920 --> 05:37.840
 whatever the side is on the COVID pandemic and you, I mean there's a mass

05:37.840 --> 05:43.840
 amount of attack on you. Outside of being a public persona, outside of being

05:43.840 --> 05:51.360
 comedian, podcast, you're also a human being. So how did you survive that? How

05:51.360 --> 05:57.680
 did you sort of walk through that fire? Because you seem to do it with grace. I

05:57.680 --> 06:05.160
 use mushrooms. That was one way I did it. Yeah, yeah. Really? What's your, as Andrew

06:05.160 --> 06:10.440
 Huberman would say, what was your protocol? I took, it was probably less than a

06:10.440 --> 06:20.720
 gram every day. Every day. Yeah. And I did a lot of like really hard working out but

06:20.720 --> 06:29.240
 also, I mean, there's a great benefit to going through anything difficult and if

06:29.240 --> 06:35.080
 you're aware, like in advance and why, enduring, like anything that's gonna

06:35.080 --> 06:40.840
 happen that's very difficult and troubling. The great benefit is it gives

06:40.840 --> 06:46.040
 you an opportunity to grow, gives you an opportunity to express yourself under

06:46.040 --> 06:51.760
 pressure, to show your character, to show who you truly are and it gives you an

06:51.760 --> 06:58.280
 opportunity to see how you handle a very difficult situation. It also was

06:58.280 --> 07:05.080
 fascinating as a person that's involved in media, right? Because what we're doing

07:05.080 --> 07:10.840
 right now is media, even though, you know, it seems like podcasts seem like

07:10.840 --> 07:15.680
 we're just having a conversation, right? And they are. In a sense, it's kind of

07:15.680 --> 07:22.880
 the purest form of media because what you're doing is you're doing it

07:22.880 --> 07:28.840
 without any fanfare, you're doing it without any, there's no executives

07:28.840 --> 07:33.200
 looming over your head or network or big meetings about ratings or any of that

07:33.200 --> 07:38.640
 stuff, but it is media. But what I got to see is the wiring under the machine of

07:38.640 --> 07:44.800
 how the rest of media would try to take me out and, you know, like when CNN

07:44.800 --> 07:49.520
 would be just be playing things over and over and back and forth, it was wild to

07:49.520 --> 07:57.120
 watch. What was also wild to watch was people's responses because I gained two

07:57.120 --> 08:02.920
 million subscribers during that time. Like the podcast never got bigger. It just

08:02.920 --> 08:08.000
 kept growing. It had never been bigger than it had been like at the end of all

08:08.000 --> 08:15.320
 of it. It just made it bigger. And, you know, ultimately, when, if you've fucked

08:15.320 --> 08:19.800
 up in the past or made mistakes or done something wrong, that gives you an

08:19.800 --> 08:25.160
 opportunity to discuss those things and to say, to apologize if you feel the need

08:25.160 --> 08:31.560
 to apologize and also to just address it. And so people under that kind of

08:31.560 --> 08:34.920
 pressure, they get, it's an opportunity for them to understand how you think

08:34.920 --> 08:39.240
 about things. Honestly, how you actually honestly think about things. And there's

08:39.240 --> 08:43.160
 no more honesty that you get out of a person than when that person is under

08:43.160 --> 08:48.480
 extreme duress. You know, so I think in that sense, I mean, it's horrible to say

08:48.480 --> 08:51.880
 that it's a benefit, that it's a good thing that it happened. But it was a

08:51.880 --> 08:52.440
 benefit.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.400
 Can you see how it can break a person?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.040
 Yes.

08:55.040 --> 09:00.560
 I've gotten a chance to experience small, small attacks here and there, ones that

09:00.560 --> 09:06.880
 get to the core of things. Like even just talking to, about Russia and Ukraine, to

09:06.880 --> 09:11.880
 Stephen Cawkin or Oliver Stone, looking at different perspectives, you gain a

09:11.880 --> 09:17.040
 relative, for me, feeling like a sizable number of people who really don't like

09:17.040 --> 09:25.080
 you and say things about you that are, that may be cut deep for a reason I

09:25.080 --> 09:28.560
 don't understand why. It's just my own psychology.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.080
 Well, it's also because you can't defend yourself because they're saying it and

09:32.080 --> 09:37.560
 you're not there and you, you don't have any opportunity for a rebuttal. And if

09:37.560 --> 09:41.320
 you do have a rebuttal, you're doing it publicly and you're opening it up to the

09:41.320 --> 09:47.280
 whole world to chime in. And there's a general tendency that people have towards

09:47.280 --> 09:51.880
 negativity when they're interacting with strangers online, especially about

09:51.880 --> 09:56.040
 controversial subjects. And even if it's only 10% of the people, it's one out of

09:56.040 --> 09:59.720
 10. That's a lot. That's a lot of negativity when you're dealing with

09:59.720 --> 10:05.640
 thousands and thousands of tweets. And I think maybe I'm just a very self

10:05.640 --> 10:11.080
 critical person, but I hear their words and I probably somewhere deep inside see

10:11.080 --> 10:14.680
 the truth and the criticism in some aspect of the criticism. And that's why

10:14.680 --> 10:22.080
 it hurts. Well, it's, but it's one aspect of you, you know, but when you're

10:22.080 --> 10:29.400
 reading it, it's so it's boiled down to this one thing as if that one thing

10:29.400 --> 10:34.520
 defines you totally. Like if you've made a mistake, if you've said something that

10:34.520 --> 10:39.360
 you shouldn't have said, or if you said something and, you know, maybe you should

10:39.360 --> 10:44.560
 have considered it more carefully, giving the gravity of the situation, you

10:44.560 --> 10:48.440
 know, that that's just a part of being a person. And it's also part of being a

10:48.440 --> 10:53.600
 person where you're communicating with things publicly in real time, thinking

10:53.600 --> 10:58.160
 out loud, which is what we do. You know, it's complex. And most people don't do

10:58.160 --> 11:03.920
 it. And you're going to have these, you're going to have genuine hot takes

11:03.920 --> 11:09.560
 where people just see what you said and go, why did he say that? Fuck him. You

11:09.560 --> 11:13.200
 know, he doesn't know anything about, he doesn't live in Ukraine. He, you know,

11:13.200 --> 11:16.760
 it's like, there's, there's people that are going to have takes on that, that

11:16.760 --> 11:21.760
 way. And then there's also going to be these disingenuous people who just use

11:21.760 --> 11:25.640
 any kind of controversial topic or subject as an opportunity for them to get

11:25.640 --> 11:26.640
 clicks or views.

11:26.640 --> 11:29.880
 But that the number of those people can be quite large.

11:29.880 --> 11:30.880
 Quite large.

11:30.880 --> 11:35.560
 And so going back to, do you think it can destroy a person? Because I kind of

11:35.560 --> 11:40.360
 worry about this. And you're in many ways, but in this way, an inspiration that

11:40.360 --> 11:42.800
 it didn't seem to have destroyed you.

11:42.800 --> 11:48.360
 I kept doing shows. I kept doing stand up. I'd ignored everything. I didn't read

11:48.360 --> 11:49.360
 any of it.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.360
 So it is possible to just ignore it?

11:51.360 --> 11:55.080
 A hundred percent. Yes. Yeah. I ignored it all.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.680
 But you have like, I knew it was there.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.400
 Like your family didn't bring it up.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.240
 My family was very aware of it. My wife was aware of it.

12:01.240 --> 12:05.240
 It was a conversation like if, if your wife is aware of it, is there like a

12:05.240 --> 12:07.480
 rule, don't pretend it's not happening.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.120
 No. Just like, well, I don't, I tell her, don't ever read.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.360
 Pass the green beans.

12:11.360 --> 12:16.240
 Yeah. I don't ever let her like read negative articles to me.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.680
 You know, I don't want them. I don't care.

12:18.680 --> 12:22.280
 I go, that's a person's opinion. You take a person's opinion, you write it down.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.760
 It doesn't give it any more relevance.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.480
 Like that person, you know, could have had that opinion in silence.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.520
 They could have had it with some friends at dinner.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.400
 They don't like me, whatever. I don't want to read it.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.560
 I don't want to absorb it. I don't even know them, especially if I'm not there.

12:34.560 --> 12:41.720
 And especially if it's some biased and it's, it's not an objective opinion of me.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.880
 It's this, you know, they have a narrative and they want to stick to that

12:45.880 --> 12:48.840
 narrative and they want to write an article and they piece it all together,

12:48.840 --> 12:50.600
 make you a piece of shit.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.000
 And that's their prerogative. They're completely allowed to do that.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.520
 But I know, I shouldn't absorb that. I shouldn't take that in.

12:56.520 --> 13:00.680
 You're not supposed to be taking in the opinion of the world.

13:00.680 --> 13:00.920
 Yeah.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.960
 You're supposed to be taking in the opinion of small groups of people

13:03.960 --> 13:09.800
 that you encounter so that you get an understanding of how you make them feel.

13:09.800 --> 13:15.560
 And then maybe you say to yourself, maybe I come across too rude or maybe I come

13:15.560 --> 13:21.560
 across too insensitive or maybe, maybe I could do better in this way or that way.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.520
 That's how we sort of shape our personalities.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.520
 And that's how we, we develop our social skills.

13:26.520 --> 13:31.840
 But when the people don't know you and they have this like distorted narrative

13:31.840 --> 13:35.720
 of you and, you know, there's fucking millions of people.

13:35.720 --> 13:39.600
 There's so many people. You can't be saying, I mean,

13:39.600 --> 13:42.560
 millions of people that are like communicating about something like during

13:42.560 --> 13:47.600
 the height of the, you know, the attempt to cancel me or whatever that is.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.160
 I don't know how many people were involved in that.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.720
 People take this kind of stuff seriously.

13:51.720 --> 13:56.480
 But the problem is the false narratives take hold and then you have meetings,

13:56.480 --> 14:00.280
 you have groups, you have bills on top of each other and there's this outrage.

14:00.280 --> 14:05.560
 And then it reaches you at some point and it can just have these destructive effects.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.040
 It does.

14:06.040 --> 14:10.160
 It can. But it also sometimes doesn't.

14:10.160 --> 14:14.400
 And in my case, it didn't. It didn't work.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.320
 What lessons did you draw from that?

14:16.320 --> 14:18.320
 Mushrooms, exercise.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.600
 Mushrooms and exercise. Exercise is critical.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.800
 And so I don't think the mushrooms by themselves would have worked.

14:22.800 --> 14:27.120
 But that's the thing that I use for everything is the brutal exercise.

14:27.120 --> 14:31.520
 Like my exercise routines are horrible and because of that,

14:31.520 --> 14:33.120
 everything else is easier.

14:33.120 --> 14:37.480
 I create my own bullshit and my own bullshit is so much harder.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.680
 And it's not just that.

14:38.680 --> 14:43.400
 It's also sauna and cold plunge and these torture sessions.

14:43.400 --> 14:47.400
 They, in enduring those, when you endure those,

14:47.400 --> 14:50.200
 it makes enduring other things much easier.

14:50.200 --> 14:53.200
 And it's also an understanding of what's happening.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.880
 Like you have to know like media.

14:55.880 --> 14:59.480
 You have to understand like what the hot take,

14:59.480 --> 15:02.680
 you know, YouTube, social media, podcast,

15:02.680 --> 15:05.720
 ecosphere is doing.

15:05.720 --> 15:09.240
 Like if they're talking about, you know, Lex Friedman said this

15:09.240 --> 15:12.080
 and we have to comment on that and, you know,

15:12.080 --> 15:15.400
 Lex gets canceled in all capital letters on a YouTube clip.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.680
 And if you, you watch that, you're fucking crazy.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.920
 What are you doing? Absorbing all this negativity?

15:19.920 --> 15:20.880
 It's not good for you.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.920
 You are you. You know you.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.720
 And you know, generally, if you've made a mistake

15:25.720 --> 15:28.000
 and you know, generally, if people are upset with you.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.480
 You posted this awesome video on your Instagram

15:30.480 --> 15:35.480
 of a woman who was being interviewed in 19, late 1920s,

15:35.600 --> 15:36.440
 maybe. Yes.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.160
 Yeah. Yeah.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.920
 And she's close to a hundred years old.

15:40.920 --> 15:44.520
 So she's lived through the civil war, through World War I.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.600
 She was at the time living through the early days

15:46.600 --> 15:48.560
 of the Great Depression.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.120
 So I was just looking back, you know,

15:51.120 --> 15:53.080
 what have we as a human civilization

15:53.080 --> 15:54.360
 in recent times survived,

15:54.360 --> 15:56.280
 especially in the United States?

15:56.280 --> 15:59.520
 You're talking about the two world wars in the 20th century,

15:59.520 --> 16:03.080
 the Great Depression, the Spanish food, the pandemic

16:03.080 --> 16:05.040
 at the beginning of the 20th century.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.080
 Yeah.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.680
 What do we do in the United States?

16:07.680 --> 16:09.320
 9 11.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.680
 If you think of what are the traumatic events

16:11.680 --> 16:13.480
 that shook our world?

16:13.480 --> 16:15.160
 It's 9 11.

16:15.160 --> 16:17.760
 It's made us rethink our place in the world.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.920
 The pandemic.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.360
 Pandemic is a huge one.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.200
 One of the bigger ones, because it also accelerated

16:25.200 --> 16:27.320
 and exacerbated our anxiety,

16:27.320 --> 16:30.440
 which people have a certain level of anxiety already,

16:30.440 --> 16:32.400
 especially sedentary people.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.240
 They have a very high level of anxiety already

16:35.240 --> 16:37.680
 because I don't think they're giving their body

16:37.680 --> 16:40.440
 what it needs.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.720
 I don't think their, you know,

16:41.720 --> 16:45.040
 your body has certain requirements in terms of movement.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.680
 And when you deny your body those requirements,

16:47.680 --> 16:50.600
 I think there's like a general level of anxiety

16:50.600 --> 16:52.240
 that exists in almost everyone.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.720
 And then you have people obviously

16:53.720 --> 16:55.600
 that have mental health issues.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.800
 And that also exacerbates the anxiety.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.560
 The lockdown exacerbated the anxiety.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.640
 Losing loved ones to the pandemic exacerbated anxiety.

17:05.640 --> 17:09.080
 And then there was the division,

17:09.080 --> 17:11.600
 the different schools of thought.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.880
 The people that were never gonna get vaccinated

17:13.880 --> 17:15.040
 no matter what.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.280
 I ain't trusting it.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.240
 People that thought there was microchips in there.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.360
 People that thought that, you know, Fauci's the daemon.

17:21.360 --> 17:24.040
 And there was a lot.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.080
 And there's also like political leanings.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.640
 The right wing people tended to not wanna be vaccinated.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.760
 Whereas the left wing people for whatever reason,

17:33.760 --> 17:36.880
 all of a sudden are trusting pharmaceutical companies

17:36.880 --> 17:38.680
 like explicitly.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.200
 It was weird.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.760
 It was a weird time.

17:41.760 --> 17:46.680
 And I think over time as it gets analyzed

17:46.680 --> 17:47.880
 and we break it down,

17:47.880 --> 17:49.480
 it's gonna be one of the weirder moments

17:49.480 --> 17:51.480
 for shaping human culture.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.840
 And unfortunately for throwing gasoline on this

17:54.840 --> 17:59.840
 already burning fire of conflict

18:03.280 --> 18:08.280
 between the various factions of thought in this country.

18:08.360 --> 18:12.760
 It's already a weird time post Trump.

18:12.760 --> 18:16.000
 Like the Trump era is also going to be

18:16.000 --> 18:18.120
 one of the weirder times.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.440
 When people look back historically

18:20.440 --> 18:22.320
 about the division in this country,

18:22.320 --> 18:24.920
 he's such a polarizing figure

18:24.920 --> 18:28.360
 that so many people felt like

18:28.360 --> 18:31.920
 they could abandon their own ethics and morals

18:31.920 --> 18:36.320
 and principles just to attack him

18:36.320 --> 18:38.520
 and anybody who supports him

18:38.520 --> 18:43.360
 because he is an existential threat to democracy itself.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.560
 But don't you think it's not a cause

18:45.560 --> 18:46.760
 but maybe like a symptom?

18:46.760 --> 18:49.000
 Like it's gonna get, you said it got real weird.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.120
 Maybe it's gonna get weirder.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.680
 Yeah, I think it's gonna get weirder.

18:52.680 --> 18:53.880
 He's gonna run again.

18:53.880 --> 18:54.840
 You think he wins?

18:54.840 --> 18:57.160
 Well, he's running against a dead man.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.680
 You know, I mean, Biden shakes hands

18:59.680 --> 19:00.640
 with people that aren't even there

19:00.640 --> 19:02.000
 when he gets off stage.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.680
 I think he's seeing ghosts.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.720
 You see him on Jimmy Kimmel the other day?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.400
 Well, he was just rambling.

19:07.400 --> 19:11.280
 I mean, if he was anyone else,

19:11.280 --> 19:12.680
 if he was a Republican,

19:12.680 --> 19:14.560
 if that was Donald Trump doing that,

19:14.560 --> 19:18.240
 every fucking talk show would be screaming

19:18.240 --> 19:19.800
 for him to be off the air.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.240
 And by the way, I'm not a Trump supporter

19:22.240 --> 19:23.680
 in any way, shape, or form.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.320
 I've had the opportunity to have him on my show

19:25.320 --> 19:26.240
 more than once.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.680
 I've said no every time.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.800
 I don't wanna help him.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.560
 I'm not interested in helping him.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.920
 The night is still young, we'll see.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.480
 If I have him on, the night is still young?

19:34.480 --> 19:35.320
 You think I'll have him on?

19:35.320 --> 19:36.320
 I think you'll have him on.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.960
 Really? Why do you think that?

19:37.960 --> 19:39.560
 Because you'll have Putin on?

19:39.560 --> 19:40.400
 Yeah.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.600
 And you're competitive as fuck.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.440
 No.

19:44.440 --> 19:49.440
 I think ultimately, I mean, you've had a lot of people

19:53.080 --> 19:56.320
 that I think you may otherwise be skeptical

19:56.320 --> 19:57.800
 would I have a good conversation?

19:57.800 --> 19:59.000
 Which I think is your metric.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.080
 You don't care about politics.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.880
 So can I have a good conversation?

20:01.880 --> 20:06.200
 And I think you had people like Kanye on, for example,

20:06.200 --> 20:07.960
 and you had a great conversation with them.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.640
 I think you, I think...

20:10.640 --> 20:12.360
 Yeah, but Kanye is an artist.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.640
 But Kanye doing well or not doing well

20:14.640 --> 20:17.120
 doesn't change the course of our country.

20:18.320 --> 20:22.800
 Yeah, but you know, do you really bear the responsibility

20:22.800 --> 20:25.920
 of the course of our country based on a conversation?

20:25.920 --> 20:30.920
 I think you can revitalize and rehabilitate

20:31.560 --> 20:36.560
 someone's image in a way that is pretty shocking.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.280
 Look at the way people look at Alex Jones now.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.760
 Because Alex Jones has been on my podcast a few times.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.800
 Yeah, how do they, which direction?

20:43.800 --> 20:46.040
 The people that have watched those podcasts

20:46.040 --> 20:47.520
 think he's hilarious.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.240
 And they think that he definitely fucked up

20:50.240 --> 20:52.160
 with that whole Sandy Hook thing.

20:53.080 --> 20:56.520
 But he's right more than he's wrong.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.160
 And he's not an evil guy.

20:59.160 --> 21:03.080
 He's just a guy who's had some psychotic breaks in his life.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.080
 He's had some genuine mental health issues

21:05.080 --> 21:06.240
 that he's addressed.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.880
 He's had some serious bouts of alcoholism,

21:08.880 --> 21:12.480
 some serious bouts of, you know, substance abuse.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.480
 And they've contributed to some very poor thinking.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.480
 But if you know the guy, if you get to know him,

21:18.480 --> 21:21.160
 like I have, I've known him for more than 20 years.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.040
 And if you know him on podcasts,

21:23.040 --> 21:28.040
 you realize like he is genuinely trying to unearth

21:28.240 --> 21:32.360
 some things that are genuinely disturbing for most people.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.280
 Like this is a guy that was telling me

21:34.280 --> 21:39.280
 about Epstein's Island fucking decade ago, at least.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.600
 He was telling me about it.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.680
 I was like, what?

21:42.680 --> 21:44.840
 You're telling me there's a place

21:44.840 --> 21:48.840
 where they bring elites to compromise them

21:48.840 --> 21:50.800
 with underage girls and they film them.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.640
 Really?

21:51.640 --> 21:52.480
 Like what?

21:52.480 --> 21:53.320
 Cut the fuck out of here.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.040
 Like no, President Clinton's been there.

21:55.040 --> 21:55.880
 Everyone's been there.

21:55.880 --> 21:56.720
 Like what?

21:56.720 --> 21:58.080
 It sounds like nonsense.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.920
 And not only is it true,

21:59.920 --> 22:02.320
 but people keep getting fucking murdered for it.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.280
 Did you see that latest Clinton advisor

22:04.280 --> 22:05.600
 that got murdered about it?

22:05.600 --> 22:06.440
 Yep.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.320
 Yeah, hung with an extension cord,

22:08.320 --> 22:12.000
 shot himself in the chest, 30 miles from his house,

22:12.000 --> 22:13.400
 and they're calling it a suicide.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.400
 And now even Elon Musk is asking,

22:15.400 --> 22:17.120
 where's the clientele list?

22:17.120 --> 22:17.960
 Yeah.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.840
 We should probably see who's been to that island.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.320
 Yeah, we should probably see who's been to that island.

22:23.320 --> 22:27.440
 And there's probably more of those kind of things out there

22:27.440 --> 22:29.120
 that haven't been exposed.

22:29.120 --> 22:32.680
 Yeah, but sort of to push back,

22:32.680 --> 22:35.880
 in you had those conversations with Alex Jones,

22:35.880 --> 22:38.320
 wouldn't you be able to have the same kind of conversation

22:38.320 --> 22:39.640
 with Donald Trump?

22:39.640 --> 22:40.480
 Yeah, that's the problem.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.160
 No, it's not the problem.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.840
 You revealed that Alex Jones is a human being.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.680
 Yeah.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.520
 He's fucked up.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.480
 He has demons in his head.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.680
 He's obviously chaotic all over the place,

22:49.680 --> 22:53.720
 but there's some wisdom to the perspective

22:53.720 --> 22:54.560
 he takes on the world,

22:54.560 --> 22:57.280
 even though he is often full of shit,

22:57.280 --> 22:59.960
 he is able to predict certain things

22:59.960 --> 23:02.560
 that very few people are willing to bring up.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.160
 So isn't Trump the same way?

23:04.160 --> 23:06.760
 Fucked up person, egomaniac,

23:06.760 --> 23:10.000
 whatever personality things you can talk about,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.480
 isn't it worthwhile to lay it out?

23:12.480 --> 23:13.960
 Like who's going to,

23:13.960 --> 23:16.640
 if you listen to interviews of Trump,

23:16.640 --> 23:19.360
 who has the balls to call him out on his bullshit?

23:19.360 --> 23:21.200
 Chris Wallstead.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.520
 No, calling out somebody on their bullshit is easy

23:23.520 --> 23:25.040
 when you're just being adversarial.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.960
 But as a person who is genuinely empathetically

23:28.960 --> 23:30.760
 trying to understand,

23:30.760 --> 23:31.880
 I think you're really good at that.

23:31.880 --> 23:32.720
 Like you pulled him in.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.520
 I don't know if he would genuinely be there.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.320
 You know what I'm saying?

23:37.320 --> 23:39.880
 Like I think he would be putting on a performance.

23:39.880 --> 23:40.720
 And that's...

23:40.720 --> 23:41.800
 You don't think he can break through that

23:41.800 --> 23:42.880
 in like 30 minutes?

23:42.880 --> 23:44.840
 I'd need more time than that.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.520
 And he doesn't do any drugs.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.840
 That's the thing about Alex.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.040
 You can get Alex high, get him drunk,

23:50.040 --> 23:51.280
 and he'll start talking about

23:51.280 --> 23:53.040
 interdimensional child molesters.

23:53.040 --> 23:53.880
 Yeah.

23:53.880 --> 23:56.640
 And then you get to real Alex.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.160
 Maybe you have somebody else on as well

23:59.160 --> 24:01.480
 to introduce chaos like Alex.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.600
 No, no, no, no.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.440
 They have to be one of them.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.160
 I would have to be just me and him.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.120
 I would have to, that would be a focused thing.

24:07.120 --> 24:11.240
 I would have to like really take time with Trump.

24:11.240 --> 24:15.800
 But also I'm not well versed enough politically

24:15.800 --> 24:20.400
 to know all of the corruption that's been alleged

24:20.400 --> 24:24.520
 and to understand what the whole Russia gate stuff,

24:24.520 --> 24:27.600
 what's real, like how much of it,

24:27.600 --> 24:32.360
 it's clear that there is more than one organization

24:32.360 --> 24:34.720
 that's involved in communicating with Russia

24:34.720 --> 24:36.600
 before the 2016 election.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.120
 So it's pretty clear that the Clinton administration

24:39.120 --> 24:40.840
 was involved.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.120
 It's pretty clear that the Trump administration

24:43.120 --> 24:45.920
 had some communication with some people in Russia.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.960
 It's pretty clear that Hunter Biden

24:47.960 --> 24:51.360
 had some very suspicious dealings in Ukraine.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.880
 And there's a lot going on there, man.

24:53.880 --> 24:57.640
 And it's hard for anybody to parse.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.760
 It's really hard for anybody,

24:59.760 --> 25:03.400
 and especially to have an objective assessment

25:03.400 --> 25:05.760
 of exactly what's going on.

25:05.760 --> 25:09.200
 And then to be able to do that and broadcast it publicly.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.720
 That's quite a project.

25:10.720 --> 25:13.440
 And I think if you really want to do that correctly,

25:13.440 --> 25:16.640
 it's something that I would have to research for a long time

25:16.640 --> 25:19.680
 and to really, and I don't have that kind of time.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.680
 Not for, maybe for certain people

25:22.680 --> 25:24.320
 that you're really curious about.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.280
 Like you have that kind of time for Bob Lazar.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.280
 Yes, yes.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.720
 But maybe not for Donald Trump.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.920
 No, that's different.

25:30.920 --> 25:35.760
 Because Bob Lazar, what he's talking about,

25:35.760 --> 25:38.280
 I wanted to know, with the Bob Lazar thing,

25:38.280 --> 25:40.440
 I wanted to know, first of all, I want to be around him

25:40.440 --> 25:42.240
 and see if I could smell bullshit.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.080
 Did you?

25:43.080 --> 25:44.240
 Like, okay.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.080
 No, I didn't, man.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.600
 That was what's weird about it.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.520
 Not only did I not smell bullshit,

25:48.520 --> 25:50.720
 I went over all of his interviews.

25:50.720 --> 25:54.600
 I went, he hasn't done a lot, but he's done enough.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.920
 And he's done them over the course of 30 plus years.

25:57.920 --> 26:02.960
 And it's alarming how consistent his story is.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.520
 Which is really weird when you think about,

26:04.520 --> 26:07.680
 you're talking about back engineering alien crafts

26:07.680 --> 26:11.760
 and working on a top secret government test site

26:11.760 --> 26:13.960
 that's carved into the side of a mountain

26:13.960 --> 26:16.640
 to camouflage it from satellites.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.600
 It's such a wacky story.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.760
 But the guy really did work at Los Alamos Labs.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.800
 He really is a propulsion expert.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.760
 He really is a scientist.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.760
 Did he really work on back engineering UFOs?

26:31.760 --> 26:32.600
 I don't know.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.440
 But the way he described their motion

26:34.440 --> 26:37.600
 is exactly like what's been observed

26:37.600 --> 26:39.440
 by some of these pilots

26:39.440 --> 26:41.400
 that have these videos that they've captured.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.080
 And I just love that, like, NASA,

26:43.080 --> 26:44.840
 I've been hearing from a bunch of folks

26:44.840 --> 26:48.080
 who are legitimately like funding research

26:48.080 --> 26:51.800
 and there's people really taking the seriously

26:51.800 --> 26:54.920
 of UFO sightings, investigating them,

26:54.920 --> 26:58.280
 like adding more and more sensors to collect data

26:58.280 --> 27:01.400
 from just observing at higher definitions.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.800
 It's cool to finally see that.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.280
 And he was one of the early people,

27:04.280 --> 27:05.680
 whether he's full of shit or not,

27:05.680 --> 27:08.200
 that kind of forced people to start taking

27:08.200 --> 27:11.680
 these topics seriously.

27:11.680 --> 27:15.440
 Or at least forced people to have conversations about them

27:15.440 --> 27:17.880
 and maybe attempt to debunk them

27:17.880 --> 27:19.680
 because it seems so preposterous,

27:19.680 --> 27:21.800
 but then get sucked down the rabbit hole

27:21.800 --> 27:24.840
 and start going, hmm, maybe, we'll fucking,

27:24.840 --> 27:27.320
 it's the thing is like the Fermi paradox,

27:27.320 --> 27:29.000
 like where are they, right?

27:29.000 --> 27:32.840
 And when you take into account just the sheer raw numbers,

27:32.840 --> 27:37.160
 the vast majority of people objectively assume

27:37.160 --> 27:40.960
 that there is life out there, the vast majority.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.240
 Well, if you're really taking into account

27:43.240 --> 27:45.560
 what we understand about the universe itself,

27:45.560 --> 27:48.480
 what we understand about the concept of infinity,

27:48.480 --> 27:50.880
 and the way Neil deGrasse Tyson has explained it to me

27:50.880 --> 27:55.880
 is that not only are there life forms out there,

27:56.640 --> 27:58.560
 but there's you, you are out there.

27:58.560 --> 28:02.320
 Infinity is so large that Lex Friedman exists

28:02.320 --> 28:03.800
 and doesn't just exist,

28:03.800 --> 28:06.520
 but exists an infinite number of times,

28:06.520 --> 28:11.160
 like the amount of interactions that cells and molecules,

28:11.160 --> 28:15.360
 the same exact interactions that have happened here on earth

28:15.360 --> 28:18.720
 have happened in the exact same order,

28:18.720 --> 28:22.080
 an infinite number of times in the cosmos.

28:22.080 --> 28:25.120
 Well, first of all, it's not certain that that's true.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.680
 It's possible. It's possible.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.160
 Like Sean Carroll, you know,

28:30.040 --> 28:32.280
 especially with quantum mechanics,

28:32.280 --> 28:34.280
 based on certain interpretation of quantum mechanics,

28:34.280 --> 28:36.000
 that's very possible.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.360
 But the question is, can you access those universes?

28:40.360 --> 28:41.840
 Right, how far away are they?

28:41.840 --> 28:45.200
 The more sort of specific practical question is,

28:45.200 --> 28:47.440
 this local pocket of the universe,

28:47.440 --> 28:50.440
 our galaxy or our neighboring galaxies,

28:50.440 --> 28:51.760
 are there aliens there?

28:51.760 --> 28:53.120
 What do they look like?

28:53.120 --> 28:56.240
 Are they, so you can have this panspermia idea

28:56.240 --> 29:01.240
 where a much larger, like daddy civilization,

29:01.240 --> 29:06.240
 like rolled by and just planted a few aliens

29:07.040 --> 29:08.280
 at a similar time.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.280
 Like Prometheus.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.840
 Yes, a different, you know, throughout the galaxy.

29:12.840 --> 29:14.960
 And those are the ones we might be interacting with.

29:14.960 --> 29:18.720
 They're all kind of dumb as we are, relatively,

29:18.720 --> 29:21.720
 you know, maybe a few million years apart.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.640
 And then those are the ones we're interacting with.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.880
 And then we have a chance to actually connect with them,

29:25.880 --> 29:27.040
 communicate with them.

29:27.040 --> 29:30.160
 Or it could be like much more wide open

29:30.160 --> 29:33.240
 and you have these gigantic alien civilizations

29:33.240 --> 29:35.080
 that are expanding very, very quickly.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.520
 And the interesting thing is,

29:36.520 --> 29:39.240
 when you look up at the sky and you see the stars,

29:39.240 --> 29:43.400
 that's light from those stars.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.680
 We might not be seeing the alien civilizations

29:45.680 --> 29:47.680
 until they're already here.

29:47.680 --> 29:51.000
 Meaning, like you start expanding,

29:51.000 --> 29:52.760
 once you get really good at expanding,

29:52.760 --> 29:55.440
 you're going to be expanding very close to the speed of light.

29:55.440 --> 29:58.200
 So right now we don't see much in the sky,

29:58.200 --> 30:00.120
 but there could be one day we wake up

30:00.120 --> 30:03.280
 and it's just like everywhere and they're here.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.840
 Right, but because of the amount of time

30:04.840 --> 30:06.200
 the light takes to reach us.

30:06.200 --> 30:10.960
 Yeah, and then the thing that I've been really fascinated by

30:10.960 --> 30:15.160
 is these alternative forms of transportation

30:15.160 --> 30:16.520
 that they're discussing,

30:16.520 --> 30:19.840
 like the ability to harness wormholes

30:19.840 --> 30:22.720
 and the ability to do things

30:22.720 --> 30:26.600
 that a type three civilization is capable of.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.000
 I had Michio Kaku on my podcast recently.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.880
 Fantastic, love that guy.

30:30.880 --> 30:35.880
 He's so good at taking extremely complex concepts

30:37.600 --> 30:40.680
 and boiling them down for digestion

30:40.680 --> 30:44.120
 and saying them in a way that other people can appreciate.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.920
 And not being hesitant about saying wild,

30:46.920 --> 30:48.520
 crazy shit that's out there,

30:48.520 --> 30:51.160
 but grounded in what's actually possible.

30:51.160 --> 30:54.200
 Yeah, he's all in on this UFO phenomenon now.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.840
 He's like, now the burden of proof is to people

30:56.840 --> 30:59.120
 for people to come up with some sort of

30:59.120 --> 31:02.160
 a conventional explanation for these things.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.320
 He goes, because these things are defying

31:04.320 --> 31:07.840
 all the concepts of physics that we currently know

31:07.840 --> 31:10.000
 in terms of what our capabilities are

31:10.000 --> 31:13.320
 and propulsion systems and so many other things

31:13.320 --> 31:15.920
 that what we know about,

31:15.920 --> 31:18.680
 what current science is capable of reproducing

31:18.680 --> 31:20.080
 as far as what we know.

31:20.080 --> 31:24.840
 The problem is like these military projects

31:24.840 --> 31:27.200
 that are top secret.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.640
 Like how much money do they have?

31:28.640 --> 31:29.960
 They have a lot of money.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.920
 Like, but is it possible,

31:32.920 --> 31:34.440
 and maybe you could speak to this,

31:34.440 --> 31:38.880
 is it possible that there could be some propulsion systems

31:38.880 --> 31:41.920
 that have been developed and implemented

31:41.920 --> 31:46.400
 that are far beyond just the simple burning of rocket fuel,

31:46.400 --> 31:48.080
 pushing the fire out the back,

31:48.080 --> 31:51.600
 which forces the rocket at extreme speeds forward.

31:51.600 --> 31:55.160
 That's something that does harness gravity,

31:55.160 --> 31:58.240
 something that can distort space and time

31:58.240 --> 32:02.240
 and can make travel from one point to another

32:03.560 --> 32:05.440
 preposterously fast.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.280
 Well, not only is it possible,

32:07.280 --> 32:11.080
 I think it's likely that that kind of stuff

32:11.080 --> 32:12.960
 would be kept a secret.

32:12.960 --> 32:13.800
 Yeah.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.600
 It's just everything you see about these,

32:16.600 --> 32:21.280
 about the way either if it's contractors like Lockheed Martin

32:21.280 --> 32:24.920
 or if it's DoD, the actual departments of defense,

32:24.920 --> 32:26.680
 they operate in complete secrecy.

32:26.680 --> 32:30.840
 Just even looking at the history of the stealth fighter,

32:30.840 --> 32:33.080
 just even stealth technology was kept a secret

32:33.080 --> 32:34.760
 for a very, very long time.

32:34.760 --> 32:38.960
 And not until you're ready to use it

32:38.960 --> 32:42.120
 and need to use it, does it become public?

32:42.120 --> 32:43.520
 And not officially public,

32:43.520 --> 32:46.440
 it just is being detected out in the wild.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.400
 So there's going to be a process

32:48.400 --> 32:50.200
 where you're secretly testing it,

32:50.200 --> 32:53.240
 and that might creep up, which is maybe what we're seeing.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.720
 And then it's waiting for the next big war,

32:56.920 --> 32:59.640
 the next big reason to use the thing.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.480
 Yeah.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.200
 And so, yeah, there's definitely technologies now.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.400
 There might not be propulsion technologies,

33:05.400 --> 33:07.840
 there could be AI surveillance technologies,

33:07.840 --> 33:12.760
 there could be different kinds of stealth drones.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.080
 There could be, it could be also in cyberspace,

33:16.080 --> 33:20.000
 like cyber war weapons, all that kind of stuff.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.400
 That they're obviously going to become secret.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.160
 I'm very skeptical lately.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.800
 And the reason why I'm skeptical

33:26.800 --> 33:29.040
 is the government keeps talking about it.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.760
 The Pentagon keeps talking about it,

33:30.760 --> 33:32.520
 NASA keeps talking about it.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.160
 In which direction are you skeptical?

33:34.160 --> 33:36.360
 I'm skeptical that it's their aliens.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.840
 I think most likely it's a smoke screen.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.760
 And most likely these are some sort of

33:40.760 --> 33:43.560
 like incredibly advanced drones that they've developed

33:43.560 --> 33:47.320
 that they want to pretend don't exist.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.320
 That seems the more likely scenario,

33:49.320 --> 33:51.320
 because otherwise, my take is like,

33:51.320 --> 33:54.720
 what's the benefit of them discussing these things?

33:54.720 --> 33:56.000
 Like, what's the benefit of them

33:56.000 --> 33:57.640
 discussing these things openly?

33:57.640 --> 34:01.320
 These are, you know, the way they described it,

34:01.320 --> 34:05.200
 off world crafts, not made from this earth.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.280
 Like, why?

34:07.280 --> 34:08.920
 Why would they tell us that?

34:08.920 --> 34:13.000
 I mean, unless there's an imminent danger

34:13.000 --> 34:16.720
 of us being invaded and they want to prepare people

34:16.720 --> 34:18.640
 so they don't freak out as much.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.760
 You know, like maybe freak them out a little bit,

34:20.760 --> 34:24.040
 say that publicly, the New York Times article,

34:24.040 --> 34:26.080
 the Pentagon discussing it,

34:26.080 --> 34:26.920
 all these different things happening.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.080
 Test the waters.

34:28.080 --> 34:28.920
 Yeah.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.640
 Well, let people know that this is a thing.

34:31.640 --> 34:32.480
 Yeah.

34:32.480 --> 34:36.920
 Or my take is like that, I don't think they do that.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.600
 I don't think they tell us.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.520
 I think they, I think,

34:40.520 --> 34:42.360
 I think the government has a lot of contempt

34:42.360 --> 34:44.160
 for the citizens.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.000
 I really do.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.240
 I think they have contempt for our intelligence.

34:47.240 --> 34:49.520
 They have contempt for our need to know things.

34:49.520 --> 34:53.080
 And I also think they think that they are running us.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.040
 It's not, we're all in this together

34:55.040 --> 34:56.960
 and the government works for the people

34:56.960 --> 34:58.720
 and the government is of the people.

34:58.720 --> 34:59.960
 I don't think they think that way.

34:59.960 --> 35:00.800
 Yeah.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.360
 The basic idea is you can't trust the populace,

35:03.360 --> 35:06.000
 the government itself, because we're a bunch of idiots.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.080
 Yeah.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.840
 I think that's accurate.

35:08.840 --> 35:12.360
 Well, they're not wrong, but they're also idiots,

35:12.360 --> 35:13.400
 power hungry idiots.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.240
 Yeah.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.120
 I don't think they're, I don't think everyone's an idiot,

35:16.120 --> 35:17.840
 but I think there are enough idiots

35:17.840 --> 35:19.360
 that it becomes a real problem

35:19.360 --> 35:21.640
 if you're completely honest about everything you do.

35:21.640 --> 35:26.240
 And you don't want to let everybody weigh in

35:26.240 --> 35:28.120
 about things that are incredibly complex

35:28.120 --> 35:30.240
 and that most people are ignorant of.

35:30.240 --> 35:34.000
 And on top of that, there's this machine of intelligence.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.360
 I've recently been reading a lot about the KGB, about the FSB.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.840
 So several things sparked my curiosity.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.880
 So one, I'm traveling to Ukraine and to Moscow.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.560
 And because of that, I started to sort of

35:46.560 --> 35:48.080
 ask practical questions of myself,

35:48.080 --> 35:50.440
 just traveling, all those kinds of things.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.360
 So I started reading a lot about the KGB,

35:52.360 --> 35:55.040
 Jack Barsky as a book on this, I talked to him.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.640
 And you start to realize,

35:57.640 --> 35:58.880
 you probably looked into some of this,

35:58.880 --> 36:02.520
 but you just start to realize the scale

36:02.520 --> 36:05.360
 of surveillance and manipulation.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.880
 Now, a lot of them also talk about the incompetence

36:08.880 --> 36:11.920
 of those organizations, the usual bureaucracy creeps in.

36:11.920 --> 36:16.760
 But the point is, it seems like there's no line

36:16.760 --> 36:18.680
 they're not willing to cross

36:18.680 --> 36:22.040
 for the purpose of gathering intelligence,

36:22.040 --> 36:23.800
 for the purpose of controlling people

36:23.800 --> 36:25.640
 in order to gather intelligence.

36:25.640 --> 36:30.640
 Now, this is MI6, FSB, there's not much information

36:32.120 --> 36:34.960
 about the FSB or the GRU, but the KGB.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.360
 So we're always like 20 years behind or more

36:38.360 --> 36:40.000
 on the actual information.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.440
 And so I started to wonder,

36:43.360 --> 36:45.560
 so I have not officially been contacted

36:45.560 --> 36:49.480
 by any intelligence agency, but I started to wonder,

36:49.480 --> 36:54.480
 well, is there somebody I know that's doing that,

36:54.600 --> 36:59.600
 undercover CIA or undercover FSB, undercover anything?

37:00.400 --> 37:01.760
 You probably do.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.480
 Have you asked yourself this question?

37:03.480 --> 37:04.680
 Yeah, for sure.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.840
 Yeah, people that have been on my podcast.

37:06.840 --> 37:07.680
 Yeah, for sure.

37:07.680 --> 37:10.480
 Do you think there was actually a guess that may have been?

37:10.480 --> 37:11.320
 100%.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.160
 Oh man.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.000
 I would imagine.

37:13.000 --> 37:13.840
 Would you know?

37:14.800 --> 37:15.880
 I have suspicions.

37:15.880 --> 37:16.920
 Do you care?

37:16.920 --> 37:17.760
 Is this?

37:18.720 --> 37:23.720
 I mean, it depends on what they're attempting to do, right?

37:23.760 --> 37:27.160
 Like if I felt like there was some deception involved

37:27.160 --> 37:29.160
 and they were trying to use the podcast

37:29.160 --> 37:33.160
 to manipulate a narrative in a deceptive way

37:33.160 --> 37:36.280
 to trick people into things, yeah, I would care.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.720
 But this is exactly what,

37:37.720 --> 37:38.920
 those are the kind of things they do.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.520
 They do plant narratives.

37:40.520 --> 37:44.080
 Yeah, I mean, I would imagine

37:44.080 --> 37:46.640
 if you have the number one podcast in the world

37:46.640 --> 37:49.800
 that people would wanna infiltrate that.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.240
 Yeah, there's probably meetings

37:51.240 --> 37:53.960
 in all major intelligence agencies about,

37:53.960 --> 37:56.480
 okay, what are the large platforms?

37:56.480 --> 37:59.880
 How do we spread the message?

37:59.880 --> 38:03.360
 Yeah, well, I mean, that's the thing that really emerged

38:03.360 --> 38:05.880
 when we're talking about during my cancellation,

38:05.880 --> 38:07.720
 that there's a clear,

38:07.720 --> 38:12.400
 there's no objective analysis of this in mainstream media.

38:12.400 --> 38:16.040
 There's clear narratives that they're trying to push forward

38:16.040 --> 38:21.040
 to whether it's to promote certain ideas

38:21.200 --> 38:26.200
 or to diminish the power and reach of people who are Mavericks

38:26.480 --> 38:29.920
 or people who are, you know,

38:29.920 --> 38:31.720
 who aren't connected to a system

38:31.720 --> 38:33.040
 that you can't compromise.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.800
 That's where it gets dangerous, right?

38:34.800 --> 38:38.320
 Where it gets dangerous is when someone has the largest reach

38:38.320 --> 38:40.600
 but is also completely detached

38:40.600 --> 38:45.160
 and clearly is independent

38:45.160 --> 38:48.400
 in the sense of independent thinking

38:48.400 --> 38:51.120
 has on whoever he wants.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.120
 But your mind can still be manipulated.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.120
 I guess I can.

38:54.120 --> 38:56.400
 I mean, I guess everybody can be manipulated a certain way.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.440
 I manipulate my own mind, I'm sure too.

38:58.440 --> 39:01.960
 But I also spent a lot of time thinking about what I think.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.120
 You know, I don't just accept things.

39:04.120 --> 39:08.240
 Like the UFO thing, like I was all in for a while

39:08.240 --> 39:12.000
 and now I'm like, man, something smells fishy.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.800
 And then I'm thinking like, why,

39:14.800 --> 39:16.480
 here's my problem with the UFO thing.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.360
 I want it to be real so bad.

39:19.360 --> 39:20.600
 That's my problem with it.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.600
 I'm such a sucker.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.320
 I want it to be real so bad, you know?

39:25.320 --> 39:29.600
 And that's a problem for me, because I'm aware of it.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.640
 And so then I stop and think about like,

39:31.640 --> 39:36.640
 what is my desire for UFO truth to be exposed?

39:39.400 --> 39:41.160
 Well, it's cause it's fun.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.880
 You know, that's what it is.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.240
 So I have a desire for it to be real.

39:45.240 --> 39:49.960
 And I mean, I've talked to a bunch of folks about this.

39:49.960 --> 39:53.400
 So those with connection with DOD

39:54.520 --> 39:56.640
 and they do draw lines between people

39:56.640 --> 39:59.080
 that are full of shit and people who are not.

39:59.080 --> 40:01.120
 There's a lot of people in the public sphere

40:01.120 --> 40:03.040
 that they say are full of shit.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.240
 Yeah, for sure.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.800
 And then you have to kind of tell the difference.

40:06.800 --> 40:07.960
 Yeah, CNN.

40:07.960 --> 40:08.800
 Watch them talk.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.520
 Well, I mean, even that.

40:10.520 --> 40:11.360
 You know I mean it.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.200
 Everybody knows.

40:12.200 --> 40:15.400
 On the UFO topic, there's certain individuals

40:15.400 --> 40:18.440
 that are like, okay, they're just like using this.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.760
 In fact, like people who are not full of shit

40:20.760 --> 40:23.880
 are often very quiet, which is why, you know,

40:23.880 --> 40:25.520
 even Bob Lazar is an interesting story

40:25.520 --> 40:28.520
 because he was trying to be quiet for the longest time.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.320
 Well, he was worried about his own life according to Bob

40:31.320 --> 40:33.120
 and that's why he went public with it.

40:33.120 --> 40:36.120
 And initially the first videos he did with George Knapp,

40:36.120 --> 40:37.520
 they hit his identity.

40:37.520 --> 40:38.960
 Yeah, yeah.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.800
 And then he felt like that wasn't enough

40:40.800 --> 40:43.080
 and he really needed to expose his own identity

40:43.080 --> 40:48.080
 just to protect his life, which is a great story.

40:48.440 --> 40:51.000
 You know, so you gotta go, well, that seems so juicy.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.440
 I wanna buy into it.

40:52.440 --> 40:53.480
 And that's where I get nervous.

40:53.480 --> 40:54.320
 You don't know.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.160
 You don't know who to trust in this world.

40:55.160 --> 40:56.040
 Right, exactly.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.000
 How do you figure that out?

40:58.000 --> 40:59.880
 How do you figure out who to trust in your life?

40:59.880 --> 41:00.720
 You're Joe Rogan.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.120
 A lot of people want to be close to CIA agents,

41:03.120 --> 41:06.400
 FSB agents, people that want to...

41:06.400 --> 41:08.560
 I'm friends with a former CIA agent,

41:08.560 --> 41:10.760
 Mike Baker who's been on my podcast a bunch of times.

41:10.760 --> 41:11.880
 Allegedly former.

41:11.880 --> 41:12.720
 Former.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.560
 Think about that.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.520
 He's air quotes, former.

41:14.520 --> 41:15.960
 Yeah, I don't believe he's former.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.880
 His problem sure has some connection to him.

41:17.880 --> 41:19.680
 I also believe he's a good guy,

41:19.680 --> 41:23.320
 but I gain a lot of very intelligent

41:23.320 --> 41:25.120
 and well informed insights from him

41:25.120 --> 41:26.320
 as to how things work.

41:26.320 --> 41:31.320
 And I think, I'm sure he doesn't tell me

41:31.680 --> 41:33.040
 everything about everything,

41:33.040 --> 41:36.000
 but he's told me enough where I think

41:36.000 --> 41:39.280
 I can understand things better

41:39.280 --> 41:41.560
 from talking to him about the way

41:43.200 --> 41:46.400
 the elves work under the machine.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.800
 What about friends?

41:47.800 --> 41:49.240
 How do you know if you can trust?

41:49.240 --> 41:51.400
 Well, most of my friends are old friends.

41:51.400 --> 41:52.240
 Time.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.520
 So time is the thing.

41:53.520 --> 41:56.120
 Like just going through shit together.

41:56.120 --> 41:56.960
 Yeah.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.960
 And also people that, you know,

41:58.960 --> 42:01.560
 first of all comics, like...

42:01.560 --> 42:02.600
 You can trust comics?

42:02.600 --> 42:05.040
 Yeah, comics are pretty trustworthy.

42:05.040 --> 42:07.000
 The good ones, the really good ones.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
 There's not that many of us.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.160
 If there's a thousand professional comics on earth,

42:13.160 --> 42:14.760
 I'd be stunned.

42:14.760 --> 42:15.600
 I'd be stunned.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.680
 I don't even think there's a thousand,

42:16.680 --> 42:20.480
 like real professionals who you get booked all the time,

42:20.480 --> 42:24.920
 headline weekends at clubs and theaters and arenas.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.920
 And then there's levels to that, right?

42:26.920 --> 42:30.160
 There's like the guys who are middle acts

42:30.160 --> 42:32.200
 who kind of like barely scrape by,

42:32.200 --> 42:34.200
 and then like how many headliners are there?

42:34.200 --> 42:36.560
 How many like really funny headliners that I would say,

42:36.560 --> 42:37.760
 you know, if you Lex, you tell me

42:37.760 --> 42:39.360
 you're gonna be in Cincinnati.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.240
 Hey, this person's playing at this club.

42:41.240 --> 42:42.520
 Should I go see them?

42:42.520 --> 42:44.680
 I'm like, ah, you know, like,

42:44.680 --> 42:47.960
 how many people would I give the recommendation to?

42:47.960 --> 42:51.080
 And then how many people sell out theaters?

42:51.080 --> 42:53.120
 How many people sell out arenas?

42:53.120 --> 42:55.080
 How many people, there's not that many.

42:55.080 --> 42:59.400
 So those people like at the levels of comedy

42:59.400 --> 43:03.080
 where you've been doing standup for 20 years,

43:03.080 --> 43:04.920
 there's a certain amount of honesty

43:04.920 --> 43:06.480
 and a certain amount of understanding

43:06.480 --> 43:07.920
 of each other that we all have.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.560
 Oh, so that process of becoming a great comic

43:10.560 --> 43:13.200
 is like humbling in a way like Jiu Jitsu is humbling.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.200
 Very similar.

43:14.200 --> 43:18.840
 Like you've taken so much shit that somehow,

43:18.840 --> 43:21.520
 even if you're insane, even if you're chaotic,

43:21.520 --> 43:24.320
 even in the way, even if you're full of shit,

43:24.320 --> 43:26.760
 you lie a lot, all those kinds of things,

43:26.760 --> 43:29.040
 underneath it, there's a good human.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.800
 You could be surface bullshitter,

43:30.800 --> 43:33.680
 but on important things, you're trustworthy.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.680
 Hopefully, I mean, if you're not,

43:35.680 --> 43:37.160
 then people shy away from you.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.600
 And there are people like that too

43:38.600 --> 43:43.200
 that are really successful, but that are what I call islands.

43:43.200 --> 43:44.680
 I've talked to other comics about that.

43:44.680 --> 43:46.360
 Like you don't wanna be an island

43:46.360 --> 43:48.080
 because there's these people that aren't attached

43:48.080 --> 43:49.520
 to the rest of the community

43:49.520 --> 43:51.400
 and they're doing well on their own.

43:51.400 --> 43:53.600
 And usually they have like one opening act.

43:53.600 --> 43:54.680
 They bring with them on the road.

43:54.680 --> 43:56.480
 They've worked with forever

43:56.480 --> 43:59.280
 and they don't have comedy friends.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.800
 And those people are miserable

44:01.800 --> 44:03.560
 because they can't relate.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.880
 Sometimes fame in itself is isolating.

44:05.880 --> 44:07.760
 So you have to actually do a lot of work

44:07.760 --> 44:09.000
 and make sure you don't.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.120
 It doesn't isolate you.

44:10.120 --> 44:12.560
 Because if you become successful,

44:12.560 --> 44:15.040
 people start wanting stuff from you.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.760
 And then sometimes you wanna push them away

44:16.760 --> 44:19.840
 because of that as opposed to connect with them.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.800
 Yeah, I don't enjoy it when people want things from me.

44:22.800 --> 44:23.640
 It's not fun.

44:23.640 --> 44:24.480
 Disignore it.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.600
 Yeah, it's fucking too heavy.

44:26.600 --> 44:27.640
 They want too much.

44:27.640 --> 44:32.080
 And it's too much of a disproportionate relationship.

44:32.080 --> 44:34.360
 You know, it's too unbalanced.

44:34.360 --> 44:37.360
 Because there are people where you could tell

44:37.360 --> 44:39.960
 that they're working towards something.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.920
 They're working towards an angle

44:41.920 --> 44:44.160
 and they want to be close to you

44:44.160 --> 44:46.360
 because you will benefit them.

44:46.360 --> 44:48.480
 And then there's other people that are just,

44:48.480 --> 44:50.080
 there's not that many of us.

44:50.080 --> 44:52.120
 And so we all wanna hang out together.

44:52.120 --> 44:54.520
 Like one of the podcasts I love the most

44:54.520 --> 44:57.680
 is this podcast I do called Protect Our Parks.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.040
 It's a thing I do with Ari Shafir,

45:00.040 --> 45:01.880
 Shane Gillis and Mark Northern.

45:01.880 --> 45:03.120
 It's so fun.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.920
 Because we just get obliterated

45:04.920 --> 45:07.040
 and we talk so much shit.

45:07.040 --> 45:09.400
 Like there's conversations after that podcast where I go,

45:09.400 --> 45:11.600
 hey man, we gotta cut that part out.

45:11.600 --> 45:14.720
 Because like Shane will go too far or go too crazy,

45:14.720 --> 45:17.920
 but we're just making each other laugh and it's just fun.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.760
 And it's like that kind of camaraderie

45:19.760 --> 45:22.560
 between real comics is very precious to me.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.120
 My favorite part of that is like the non sequitur stuff

45:25.120 --> 45:26.560
 from Mark Norman.

45:26.560 --> 45:29.240
 You guys get so trashed that you don't even understand

45:29.240 --> 45:30.280
 what the hell he's talking about.

45:30.280 --> 45:32.040
 But it's funny to the listener.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.160
 Because he's still on point.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.520
 That guy is sharp.

45:34.520 --> 45:35.360
 He's so good.

45:35.360 --> 45:38.440
 He's got that Mitch Hedberg quality with us.

45:38.440 --> 45:41.320
 Well, he's such a dedicated comic.

45:41.320 --> 45:43.560
 You know, he loves comedy so much.

45:43.560 --> 45:44.800
 That's one of the things I love about him.

45:44.800 --> 45:46.160
 He's like comedy.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.520
 He gets excited.

45:47.520 --> 45:48.360
 He loves it.

45:48.360 --> 45:50.200
 It's as does Shane and as does Ari.

45:50.200 --> 45:51.040
 Yeah.

45:51.040 --> 45:51.880
 You know, they really love it.

45:51.880 --> 45:54.760
 And it's, that's so, so there's that.

45:54.760 --> 45:56.240
 Like I have friends in that way

45:56.240 --> 45:58.840
 and I have martial arts friends who are some of the,

45:58.840 --> 46:01.080
 also the thing about being humbled,

46:01.080 --> 46:03.600
 how things like Jiu Jitsu will humble you.

46:03.600 --> 46:07.440
 Martial arts friends are, they're also,

46:07.440 --> 46:11.240
 they know, they know who's been through it.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.560
 You know, they know who's,

46:12.560 --> 46:15.400
 who really has gone through the gauntlet

46:15.400 --> 46:18.440
 and emerged on the other end a better person.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.880
 Well, you said there's very few of us.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.280
 Let's have the goat discussion.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.280
 You're not gonna pick anybody,

46:23.280 --> 46:25.920
 but who are the greats of comedy?

46:25.920 --> 46:27.400
 Who's the, who's the,

46:27.400 --> 46:29.120
 who's the greatest comic of all time?

46:29.120 --> 46:32.520
 Well, I don't think there is a greatest comic of all time.

46:32.520 --> 46:34.400
 Is it Norm MacDonald?

46:34.400 --> 46:36.920
 Norm MacDonald was one of the greats for sure.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.480
 Well, by the way, actually on that topic,

46:38.480 --> 46:40.160
 what do you think about his,

46:40.160 --> 46:42.040
 I think as a person who is fascinated

46:42.040 --> 46:43.760
 by the fear of death and death,

46:43.760 --> 46:47.440
 I think it was a truly genius thing

46:47.440 --> 46:50.480
 to release a special after you're dead.

46:50.480 --> 46:51.320
 I don't know how that worked.

46:51.320 --> 46:52.600
 I haven't seen a special of you.

46:52.600 --> 46:56.120
 It's not, yeah, it's, it's called,

46:56.120 --> 46:57.560
 I think nothing special.

46:58.840 --> 47:00.840
 Which sounds like something Norm would say.

47:00.840 --> 47:04.360
 And it's basically him in front of,

47:04.360 --> 47:08.480
 I mean, I imagine he wouldn't want to edit it that way

47:08.480 --> 47:10.640
 because it's made to look nicer

47:10.640 --> 47:13.320
 than I think he probably would have preferred it.

47:13.320 --> 47:15.840
 But it's him in front of the screen,

47:15.840 --> 47:20.840
 like on a zoom call doing jokes without cold.

47:21.640 --> 47:22.480
 Really?

47:22.480 --> 47:23.320
 Yeah.

47:23.320 --> 47:28.320
 And somehow given his like dry, dark humor, it works.

47:30.040 --> 47:32.200
 Cause it's almost making fun of itself.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.000
 Almost making fun of that whole

47:34.000 --> 47:38.080
 that we were stuck, stuck alone inside.

47:38.080 --> 47:39.920
 And because he's still acting

47:39.920 --> 47:42.120
 as if he's in front of the audience.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.960
 And it's almost making fun of the fact

47:43.960 --> 47:45.640
 that this is what we're forced to do.

47:45.640 --> 47:46.680
 I mean, it's quite genius.

47:46.680 --> 47:47.520
 It's really well done.

47:47.520 --> 47:49.160
 The jokes are really good.

47:49.160 --> 47:51.640
 But it also makes you realize how important laughter

47:51.640 --> 47:54.360
 is from the audience, the energy from the audience.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.920
 Cause, but there's also an intimacy

47:56.920 --> 47:58.760
 because it's just you and him.

47:58.760 --> 48:00.160
 Because you're listening into it.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.720
 You know, there's no audience.

48:01.720 --> 48:02.800
 So that's, I don't know.

48:02.800 --> 48:04.640
 I think it's quite genius.

48:04.640 --> 48:08.400
 And he is of course, there's certain comics they're like,

48:08.400 --> 48:12.520
 not only are they funny, but they're truly unique.

48:13.360 --> 48:18.360
 And like they're, they're not in terms of friendship

48:18.680 --> 48:19.440
 and all that kind of stuff,

48:19.440 --> 48:21.920
 but in terms of comedy, they're an island.

48:21.920 --> 48:22.760
 Yeah.

48:22.760 --> 48:25.120
 It's like they, you know, Mitch Hedberg probably is that,

48:25.120 --> 48:27.560
 of course a lot of people then start to imitate them

48:27.560 --> 48:28.400
 and so on, but.

48:28.400 --> 48:29.320
 Steven Wright.

48:29.320 --> 48:30.640
 Steven Wright.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.960
 I mean, there's like people who are like, you know,

48:32.960 --> 48:36.840
 Dave Chappelle, who's like probably one of the greats.

48:36.840 --> 48:38.920
 But he's just like raw funny.

48:38.920 --> 48:39.760
 Yeah.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.080
 I don't know if he's an island.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.160
 He's just raw.

48:42.160 --> 48:43.000
 Yeah.

48:43.000 --> 48:43.840
 I know what you're saying.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.400
 An outlier, a unique individual.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.600
 Yeah. He's just great.

48:48.040 --> 48:50.560
 Norm was definitely unique in his greatness.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.960
 Like, like there's only one norm, you know,

48:52.960 --> 48:54.640
 who's got a very specific style.

48:54.640 --> 48:55.960
 Is there a reason you guys weren't,

48:55.960 --> 48:59.040
 it doesn't seem like he was, you guys were close.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.080
 I mean, I loved him.

49:00.080 --> 49:00.920
 He was great.

49:00.920 --> 49:02.440
 I always enjoyed talking to him.

49:04.240 --> 49:05.680
 We just didn't work together that often.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.320
 We weren't around each other that often.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.160
 That's all it was.

49:08.160 --> 49:11.720
 But it wasn't like, it was, I loved him though.

49:11.720 --> 49:12.560
 He was a great guy.

49:12.560 --> 49:15.040
 I had a funny story about it, Norm.

49:15.040 --> 49:18.920
 Twice, just randomly, I was on airplanes next to him.

49:18.920 --> 49:20.320
 Seated right next to him.

49:20.320 --> 49:21.960
 Just totally random.

49:21.960 --> 49:25.320
 And one time, we're on this airplane

49:25.320 --> 49:27.800
 and we're having this talk and I was like, yeah,

49:27.800 --> 49:28.920
 quit smoking.

49:28.920 --> 49:31.200
 I was smoking a lot and I just,

49:31.200 --> 49:34.560
 yeah, it's terrible, terrible, smoking's terrible for you.

49:34.560 --> 49:35.960
 And we have this great conversation.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.200
 We get off the plane

49:37.200 --> 49:41.720
 and he sprints towards a store and buys cigarettes,

49:41.720 --> 49:44.440
 like in the airport and is lighting it

49:44.440 --> 49:46.760
 on the way out the door.

49:46.760 --> 49:48.280
 And I go, I thought you quit smoking.

49:48.280 --> 49:49.360
 I was like, yeah, I did.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.080
 But all that talking about smoking

49:51.080 --> 49:52.480
 made me want to smoke again.

49:54.480 --> 49:57.960
 So before he's getting through the door of the airport,

49:57.960 --> 49:58.800
 he's lighting it up.

49:58.800 --> 49:59.640
 I can't wait.

50:01.080 --> 50:02.840
 He can't wait to get that cigarette in him.

50:02.840 --> 50:06.840
 It was, he was just so crazy and impulsive

50:06.840 --> 50:09.960
 and loved to gamble, loved gambling.

50:09.960 --> 50:12.440
 And in that way, he embodied the joke.

50:12.440 --> 50:14.200
 Like you can't even tell that certain people

50:14.200 --> 50:18.040
 just like live in a non sequitur,

50:19.200 --> 50:21.800
 ridiculous, absurd, funny way.

50:21.800 --> 50:23.200
 Yeah, that was him.

50:23.200 --> 50:25.080
 I mean. Non stop.

50:25.080 --> 50:27.720
 There was nothing artificial about Norm.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.000
 You know, that was who he was.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.240
 His brilliance was his essence.

50:33.240 --> 50:35.440
 That was who he was, you know?

50:35.440 --> 50:37.320
 But it's in terms of like the greats,

50:38.240 --> 50:40.880
 the Godfather of it all is Lenny Bruce.

50:40.880 --> 50:44.400
 I mean, I have a bunch of Lenny Bruce concert posters

50:44.400 --> 50:46.800
 at my house and photos that I have framed

50:46.800 --> 50:49.120
 and Whitney Cummings actually gave me this brilliant

50:49.120 --> 50:52.720
 photo of him when he got arrested for one of the times

50:52.720 --> 50:55.960
 when he got arrested for saying obscene jokes.

50:55.960 --> 51:00.080
 He was the most important figure in the early days

51:00.080 --> 51:03.160
 of comedy because he essentially gave birth

51:03.160 --> 51:05.840
 through the modern art form of standup comedy.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.280
 Before that, it was a bunch of guys

51:07.280 --> 51:10.920
 that were like hosting shows and they would tell jokes.

51:10.920 --> 51:13.320
 They would just like, you know,

51:13.320 --> 51:16.040
 two guys walking to a bar, that kind of stuff.

51:16.040 --> 51:21.040
 And he would talk about social issues.

51:21.560 --> 51:23.280
 You know, he would talk about life.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.680
 He would talk about language.

51:24.680 --> 51:27.440
 He would talk about laws.

51:27.440 --> 51:31.680
 And it was just, he was the very first guy

51:31.680 --> 51:33.840
 who did modern standup.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.880
 And what's fascinating is if you go

51:35.880 --> 51:38.000
 and you try to watch it,

51:39.280 --> 51:43.040
 if you try to watch Lenny Bruce today, it doesn't work

51:43.040 --> 51:45.720
 because society has evolved.

51:45.720 --> 51:48.640
 Like in many ways, art is a window,

51:48.640 --> 51:51.420
 especially like pop culture or modern,

51:51.420 --> 51:56.420
 you know, at the time, culture, art that discusses culture

51:59.580 --> 52:01.740
 is a window into that time period.

52:01.740 --> 52:03.460
 It's a little bit of a time machine.

52:03.460 --> 52:05.900
 So you get to like, you have to put yourself,

52:05.900 --> 52:08.660
 like what was it like to be in 1963?

52:08.660 --> 52:11.500
 Like what was he, in 1963, what was this like

52:11.500 --> 52:13.540
 to hear him say this?

52:13.540 --> 52:18.540
 And the civilization that existed in 1963,

52:18.620 --> 52:20.660
 although it looked pretty similar,

52:20.660 --> 52:23.060
 they're all driving cars and they're all wearing suits

52:23.060 --> 52:24.420
 and they're all, the old team's normal.

52:24.420 --> 52:27.100
 That's a, it's a different world.

52:27.100 --> 52:30.300
 And the things that he was saying that are so taboo

52:30.300 --> 52:34.460
 are so normal today, that they're not shocking.

52:34.460 --> 52:36.580
 And it's not, not that good.

52:36.580 --> 52:37.540
 It's not that funny.

52:37.540 --> 52:41.100
 Yeah, you have to do the same kind of stuff for,

52:41.100 --> 52:43.100
 like there's a, D.H. Lawrence has a book called

52:43.100 --> 52:45.620
 Lady, Shadowy's Lover.

52:45.620 --> 52:46.800
 And I know it sounds ridiculous,

52:46.800 --> 52:48.500
 but it was one of the early books,

52:48.500 --> 52:52.380
 I believe it, over a century ago,

52:52.380 --> 52:55.100
 that was very controversial for its sexual content.

52:55.100 --> 52:56.460
 It's sort of one of the great books

52:56.460 --> 52:59.340
 because it dared to actually talk about

52:59.340 --> 53:01.740
 a woman cheating on her husband

53:01.740 --> 53:04.860
 and like, and do so in the highest form.

53:04.860 --> 53:07.140
 And the same thing with Gulag Archipelago,

53:07.140 --> 53:11.020
 talking about some of the darkest aspects of human history

53:11.020 --> 53:14.060
 right when all of that stuff is forbidden,

53:14.060 --> 53:15.140
 when it's banned.

53:15.140 --> 53:19.020
 Because now it's like, yes, we all know this history,

53:19.020 --> 53:20.740
 but when in the middle of it,

53:20.740 --> 53:22.020
 when you're risking your own life,

53:22.020 --> 53:25.300
 when you're risking your book being banned or burned,

53:25.300 --> 53:28.060
 or you being imprisoned, that's what it matters,

53:28.060 --> 53:29.460
 like taking that risk.

53:29.460 --> 53:32.580
 Yeah, and no one took that risk more than Lenny Bruce.

53:32.580 --> 53:35.040
 Lenny Bruce was arrested many, many times.

53:35.040 --> 53:39.300
 And ultimately, he wound up costing him his life.

53:39.300 --> 53:42.460
 I mean, he died on the bathroom floor shooting heroin

53:42.460 --> 53:44.820
 and trying to cope with all the lawsuits

53:44.820 --> 53:45.780
 that he was going through.

53:45.780 --> 53:48.020
 I mean, this guy was constantly being arrested

53:48.020 --> 53:50.180
 and constantly going through lawsuits.

53:50.180 --> 53:53.180
 And then his comedy deteriorated horribly.

53:53.180 --> 53:56.540
 There's some footage of him towards the end of his career

53:56.540 --> 53:59.020
 where he essentially would go on stage with legal papers

53:59.020 --> 54:01.780
 and read from the legal papers about his case.

54:01.780 --> 54:03.460
 From then, it's Richard Pryor.

54:03.460 --> 54:05.860
 From him, then the next great is Richard Pryor.

54:05.860 --> 54:09.500
 And he had the most profound impact on me when I was a kid.

54:09.500 --> 54:11.860
 When I was 15 years old, my parents took me to sea

54:11.860 --> 54:13.700
 live at the Sunset Strip,

54:13.700 --> 54:15.900
 which is a Richard Pryor's concert film.

54:15.900 --> 54:21.020
 And I remember very distinctly being in that audience

54:21.020 --> 54:24.460
 and laughing and looking around at all the people

54:24.460 --> 54:27.620
 in the audience who were falling out of their chairs,

54:27.620 --> 54:32.340
 just dying, laughing, just swaying back and forth.

54:32.340 --> 54:33.700
 And I was laughing hard too.

54:33.700 --> 54:37.380
 And I was like, my God, this guy's doing this just by talking.

54:37.380 --> 54:39.420
 And I thought of all the great movies that I'd seen

54:39.420 --> 54:42.220
 that I loved that were hilarious comedy movies.

54:42.220 --> 54:44.260
 And I was like, nothing that I've ever seen

54:44.260 --> 54:45.540
 is as funny as this.

54:45.540 --> 54:47.700
 And all he's doing is talking.

54:47.700 --> 54:50.660
 And that planted a seed in my head

54:50.660 --> 54:52.780
 for my love of stand up comedy

54:52.780 --> 54:55.260
 and my curiosity about the art form.

54:55.260 --> 54:59.100
 And that's what got me interested in watching on television

54:59.100 --> 55:01.540
 and then ultimately going to open mic nights

55:01.540 --> 55:04.260
 and then eventually doing it.

55:04.260 --> 55:07.100
 I've actually been going to open mics a lot recently,

55:07.100 --> 55:11.300
 just listening for psychological examinations of people.

55:11.300 --> 55:16.020
 No, it's actually really inspiring to me to see people

55:16.020 --> 55:18.940
 that some are funny, some are not so funny,

55:20.500 --> 55:23.580
 unapologetically trying, putting it all out there night

55:23.580 --> 55:27.300
 after night, like eating shit.

55:27.300 --> 55:30.500
 My favorite is when you're talking about

55:30.500 --> 55:32.820
 like five people in the audience

55:32.820 --> 55:35.700
 and the jokes are just not landing.

55:37.020 --> 55:39.500
 And they still, I don't know,

55:39.500 --> 55:42.620
 it feels like even just empathetically,

55:42.620 --> 55:44.980
 there's few things as difficult as that.

55:44.980 --> 55:46.420
 It's hard.

55:46.420 --> 55:48.580
 I still remember those days.

55:48.580 --> 55:49.860
 Many comics will say this,

55:49.860 --> 55:51.740
 and I think Dane Cook was the first person

55:51.740 --> 55:53.180
 I heard say it publicly,

55:53.180 --> 55:55.900
 that if he ever had to go back and do it again,

55:55.900 --> 55:57.900
 like from scratch, doesn't think he could do it,

55:57.900 --> 56:00.980
 doesn't think he could endure the struggle

56:00.980 --> 56:05.580
 of open mic to, you know, ultimately to success.

56:05.580 --> 56:08.020
 And the numbers of people that try it

56:08.020 --> 56:13.020
 and fail versus try and succeed are off the charts.

56:13.100 --> 56:15.500
 I don't know if there's any other art form

56:15.500 --> 56:18.540
 that has such a low rate of success.

56:18.540 --> 56:20.460
 Because it's psychological, it's torture.

56:20.460 --> 56:23.740
 It is torture, and it's also not something you can learn.

56:23.740 --> 56:27.820
 Like, here's the thing, like, if you play guitar,

56:27.820 --> 56:29.580
 you can learn to play guitar.

56:29.580 --> 56:30.820
 Someone can teach you the chords,

56:30.820 --> 56:34.820
 and if you do it, you could do all along the watch tower,

56:34.820 --> 56:35.740
 you could play it.

56:35.740 --> 56:39.620
 You can't teach someone how to do comedy.

56:39.620 --> 56:41.060
 You think it's your funny or not,

56:41.060 --> 56:44.820
 or can you still figure it out?

56:44.820 --> 56:45.660
 Like, can you still learn?

56:45.660 --> 56:47.220
 Yeah, you can figure it out, yeah.

56:47.220 --> 56:51.660
 Can you start being unfunny and become funny?

56:51.660 --> 56:53.300
 Yes, it's possible.

56:53.300 --> 56:54.900
 It's not easy, though.

56:54.900 --> 56:56.540
 You're gonna have to eat a lot of shit.

56:56.540 --> 56:57.660
 You're gonna have to eat a lot of shit,

56:57.660 --> 57:00.380
 and you're gonna have to examine why you're not funny.

57:00.380 --> 57:03.300
 And you're gonna have to spend a lot of time

57:03.300 --> 57:06.380
 with uncomfortable thoughts and try to figure out

57:06.380 --> 57:09.060
 what it is, like, what's missing?

57:09.060 --> 57:11.460
 Like, you know, could you edit your stuff

57:11.460 --> 57:13.300
 and make it better?

57:13.300 --> 57:15.260
 Maybe you need to do drugs.

57:15.260 --> 57:17.900
 Maybe you need to get involved in psychedelic drugs

57:17.900 --> 57:21.700
 and rethink the way you interface with reality itself.

57:21.700 --> 57:23.820
 Maybe you need your heart broken.

57:23.820 --> 57:25.460
 Maybe you need to be in love.

57:25.460 --> 57:27.700
 Maybe, there's a lot of maybes there.

57:27.700 --> 57:29.940
 Like, maybe you just need more life experience.

57:29.940 --> 57:32.660
 But, you know, when I started comedy, I was 21,

57:32.660 --> 57:33.500
 and I was a moron.

57:33.500 --> 57:35.820
 I had no information.

57:35.820 --> 57:38.540
 You know, I could do impressions of people,

57:38.540 --> 57:40.140
 and I could talk about sex.

57:40.140 --> 57:43.700
 Those are the things that I was interested in back then.

57:43.700 --> 57:45.540
 I mean, if I was talking philosophically,

57:45.540 --> 57:47.380
 I didn't have a philosophy.

57:47.380 --> 57:50.380
 I didn't have a unique perspective on life.

57:50.380 --> 57:52.140
 I hadn't experienced much.

57:52.140 --> 57:53.140
 So every time you bomb,

57:53.140 --> 57:56.620
 it forces you to introspect, to ask questions to yourself,

57:56.620 --> 57:59.260
 and then that's how you actually develop a philosophy.

57:59.260 --> 58:00.100
 Yeah.

58:00.100 --> 58:00.940
 Or what you actually believe.

58:00.940 --> 58:03.300
 You learn through doing.

58:03.300 --> 58:06.100
 And I think you could say that about podcasting too.

58:06.100 --> 58:09.060
 You know, I'm certainly way better at having conversations

58:09.060 --> 58:11.780
 than I ever was when I first started doing comedy.

58:11.780 --> 58:14.020
 Or, excuse me, when I first started doing podcasts.

58:14.020 --> 58:15.580
 You should learn to stick with a kid,

58:15.580 --> 58:18.620
 because one day you'll be able to interview Donald Trump.

58:18.620 --> 58:22.660
 You'd be mad enough to handle that conversation.

58:24.180 --> 58:25.180
 How hard is it to do?

58:25.180 --> 58:26.260
 Because I've been really curious

58:26.260 --> 58:29.660
 that it's been on my bucket list because I'm terrified.

58:29.660 --> 58:31.220
 I want to do everything I'm terrified of.

58:31.220 --> 58:32.180
 Do you want to do stand up?

58:32.180 --> 58:33.020
 No.

58:33.020 --> 58:37.380
 But I do want to do like one five minute open mic.

58:37.380 --> 58:38.900
 Why don't you do kill Tony?

58:38.900 --> 58:41.060
 How hard is it to do five minutes, would you say?

58:41.060 --> 58:42.500
 It's hard.

58:42.500 --> 58:45.260
 Well, it depends on how long you've been thinking

58:45.260 --> 58:46.660
 about doing comedy.

58:46.660 --> 58:48.980
 It depends on how you look at things.

58:48.980 --> 58:50.820
 And also depends on your style of comedy.

58:50.820 --> 58:53.100
 Like the most difficult style of comedy is like,

58:53.100 --> 58:55.100
 I think like Stephen Wright's style

58:55.100 --> 58:57.140
 is probably the most difficult style of comedy,

58:57.140 --> 58:58.740
 complete non sequiturs.

58:58.740 --> 59:00.900
 One subject doesn't lead into the next.

59:00.900 --> 59:02.180
 There's no flow to it.

59:02.180 --> 59:05.140
 It's just, I noticed this, I noticed that.

59:05.140 --> 59:07.100
 And then there's this, and then there's that.

59:07.100 --> 59:10.020
 And that's hard to memorize.

59:10.020 --> 59:11.980
 And it's really hard to piece together

59:11.980 --> 59:14.900
 an hour of non sequiturs.

59:14.900 --> 59:18.020
 But it's easier because you can rely on the joke.

59:18.020 --> 59:19.820
 It sits more with the joke.

59:20.820 --> 59:22.620
 Like whether you're funny or not

59:22.620 --> 59:25.500
 is on the actual material versus like the timing

59:25.500 --> 59:28.700
 and the energy to dance with the audience, right?

59:28.700 --> 59:31.420
 Cause like, if you don't have the raw jokes

59:31.420 --> 59:33.380
 like Stephen Wright does or Mitch Hedberg,

59:35.100 --> 59:37.340
 then you have to, it's all about the delivery.

59:37.340 --> 59:38.180
 Yeah.

59:38.180 --> 59:40.860
 And yeah, they either kill or they bomb.

59:41.940 --> 59:43.620
 Is it random?

59:43.620 --> 59:44.500
 Whether they kill or bomb?

59:44.500 --> 59:45.340
 Yeah.

59:45.340 --> 59:48.420
 Well, I mean, you're essentially a different person

59:48.420 --> 59:49.740
 every day of your life.

59:49.740 --> 59:54.060
 You know, you're similar, but you're more tired.

59:54.060 --> 59:55.500
 You're more rested.

59:55.500 --> 59:56.940
 You're exhausted.

59:56.940 --> 59:58.260
 You're refreshed.

59:58.260 --> 1:00:01.460
 You have vitamins and food, nourishment in your system.

1:00:01.460 --> 1:00:02.820
 You just get your heart broken.

1:00:02.820 --> 1:00:04.340
 You haven't slept in days.

1:00:04.340 --> 1:00:06.580
 You're a different person all the time.

1:00:06.580 --> 1:00:09.500
 And you go onto that stage.

1:00:11.020 --> 1:00:14.500
 You're in the neighborhood of who Lex Friedman is.

1:00:14.500 --> 1:00:15.860
 You're in the Lex Friedman neighborhood.

1:00:15.860 --> 1:00:17.420
 Which Lex Friedman am I gonna get?

1:00:17.420 --> 1:00:18.260
 Yeah.

1:00:18.260 --> 1:00:20.180
 Energy levels.

1:00:20.180 --> 1:00:21.020
 It depends.

1:00:21.020 --> 1:00:21.860
 It all depends.

1:00:21.860 --> 1:00:25.860
 But oh, the other thing with Kiltoni is it's videotaped.

1:00:25.860 --> 1:00:26.700
 Yes.

1:00:26.700 --> 1:00:29.460
 So you eating shit is on there forever.

1:00:29.460 --> 1:00:30.300
 Forever.

1:00:30.300 --> 1:00:31.300
 The world can see it.

1:00:31.300 --> 1:00:33.860
 But it's one of the most important shows in comedy.

1:00:33.860 --> 1:00:36.260
 It's the most important show in comedy.

1:00:36.260 --> 1:00:40.900
 Because first of all, it establishes stand up

1:00:40.900 --> 1:00:44.340
 in a sense that like for the open micers,

1:00:44.340 --> 1:00:45.740
 for the people that are starting it out,

1:00:45.740 --> 1:00:49.740
 it establishes that the most important thing is to be funny.

1:00:49.740 --> 1:00:51.780
 Like this is what the art form is all about.

1:00:51.780 --> 1:00:53.500
 And there's a lot of insecurity attached to that

1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:54.660
 and a lot of fears.

1:00:54.660 --> 1:00:57.820
 And so to alleviate some of those insecurities and fears,

1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:02.820
 people will decide that the message is more important.

1:01:03.020 --> 1:01:06.140
 And they'll pretend that, you know, like you have to have,

1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:11.140
 like you have to be socially aware

1:01:13.940 --> 1:01:16.460
 that you have to promote things

1:01:16.460 --> 1:01:19.900
 that are positive in your comedy, which is bullshit.

1:01:19.900 --> 1:01:22.780
 The people that say that, they're all bad.

1:01:22.780 --> 1:01:24.100
 They're all bad at comedy.

1:01:24.100 --> 1:01:25.900
 And that's where the insecurity is.

1:01:25.900 --> 1:01:27.500
 It's like they can't just kill.

1:01:27.500 --> 1:01:29.220
 So they have to pretend that they're supposed

1:01:29.220 --> 1:01:30.620
 to be socially aware.

1:01:30.620 --> 1:01:31.820
 And they're being socially aware

1:01:31.820 --> 1:01:33.900
 as an important part into society.

1:01:33.900 --> 1:01:36.300
 Like let me explain something really clearly.

1:01:36.300 --> 1:01:38.300
 It's not a fucking person on earth

1:01:38.300 --> 1:01:41.740
 who's ever changed their life because of a joke.

1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:43.140
 That's not what they're there for.

1:01:43.140 --> 1:01:44.300
 They're there for jokes.

1:01:44.300 --> 1:01:46.020
 The people that say that,

1:01:46.020 --> 1:01:48.500
 they say that socially important comedy

1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:50.700
 is the only comedy that's necessary.

1:01:50.700 --> 1:01:52.260
 The only comedy that you have to do.

1:01:52.260 --> 1:01:54.020
 That is just because they suck.

1:01:54.020 --> 1:01:54.860
 Yeah.

1:01:54.860 --> 1:01:55.680
 That is it.

1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:57.500
 It's like the cop out is that

1:01:57.500 --> 1:01:59.180
 they can't do the real comedy.

1:01:59.180 --> 1:02:00.340
 They can't crush.

1:02:00.340 --> 1:02:03.100
 It's not like someone goes from being,

1:02:03.100 --> 1:02:04.820
 you know, take a like Shane Gillis,

1:02:04.820 --> 1:02:06.820
 one of the best comics up and coming right now.

1:02:06.820 --> 1:02:08.380
 He's fucking fantastic.

1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:11.020
 I can't recommend enough seeing that guy live.

1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:12.700
 I worked with him in Irvine

1:02:12.700 --> 1:02:14.780
 and I hadn't seen like his whole set.

1:02:14.780 --> 1:02:16.060
 I was crying.

1:02:16.060 --> 1:02:17.300
 I mean, he's so good.

1:02:17.300 --> 1:02:18.540
 I heard he's a racist.

1:02:18.540 --> 1:02:21.740
 So I haven't listened to any of his material, no.

1:02:21.740 --> 1:02:23.140
 He's so good.

1:02:23.140 --> 1:02:26.460
 And his comedy is just all,

1:02:26.460 --> 1:02:29.540
 just trying to be as funny as possible.

1:02:29.540 --> 1:02:30.500
 There's not a chance in hell

1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:32.300
 that guy's just gonna go woke

1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:34.420
 and he's just gonna start promoting some sort of,

1:02:34.420 --> 1:02:38.340
 you know, socially conscious agenda

1:02:38.340 --> 1:02:41.900
 that's, you know, facetious and just a bunch of nonsense

1:02:41.900 --> 1:02:45.500
 that he's trying to elevate his own personal brand

1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:46.980
 and virtue signal.

1:02:46.980 --> 1:02:48.460
 That's not gonna happen.

1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:51.540
 The thing about Kill Tony is in that,

1:02:51.540 --> 1:02:54.580
 because you only have one minute and because it's live

1:02:54.580 --> 1:02:56.300
 and because you don't want Tony shitting on you,

1:02:56.300 --> 1:02:57.380
 everybody else shitting on,

1:02:57.380 --> 1:03:01.100
 everybody's just gearing up to try to be as funny as possible.

1:03:01.100 --> 1:03:05.140
 And no one cares if you are gay or straight

1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:08.780
 or Asian or black or trans or non binary.

1:03:08.780 --> 1:03:10.180
 Nobody gives a fuck.

1:03:10.180 --> 1:03:11.620
 Are you funny?

1:03:11.620 --> 1:03:14.300
 If you're funny, you're in and everybody loves you.

1:03:14.300 --> 1:03:17.060
 You could be 80, you could be 20.

1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:18.540
 Nobody gives a shit.

1:03:18.540 --> 1:03:21.700
 You could be a woman or a man or ambiguous.

1:03:21.700 --> 1:03:23.340
 Nobody fucking cares.

1:03:23.340 --> 1:03:24.180
 Are you funny?

1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:25.500
 And that's the most important thing

1:03:25.500 --> 1:03:29.940
 for a community of comedy to really promote comedy.

1:03:29.940 --> 1:03:31.140
 Just funny.

1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:32.300
 Just be funny.

1:03:32.300 --> 1:03:34.500
 And so in that sense,

1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:37.380
 Kill Tony is a real cornerstone of comedy.

1:03:37.380 --> 1:03:39.540
 It's a reminder what comedy is supposed to be about.

1:03:39.540 --> 1:03:43.220
 That said, even the funniest stuff

1:03:43.220 --> 1:03:46.140
 has underneath it some wisdom that comes out of it,

1:03:46.140 --> 1:03:48.100
 but that's not the primary goal of it.

1:03:48.100 --> 1:03:50.540
 Yeah, I mean, it might be inspiring and fun.

1:03:50.540 --> 1:03:52.100
 Oh, Tim Dillon's a great example of that.

1:03:52.100 --> 1:03:55.420
 Yeah, he's got some amazing insights in his comedy,

1:03:55.420 --> 1:03:58.500
 but it's still, it's fucking comedy.

1:03:58.500 --> 1:03:59.620
 It's all about the funny.

1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:00.780
 Yeah, it's all of the funny.

1:04:00.780 --> 1:04:02.700
 He's the best at doing that,

1:04:02.700 --> 1:04:04.420
 especially in a podcast form,

1:04:04.420 --> 1:04:07.180
 about weaving like really important points

1:04:07.180 --> 1:04:12.180
 in with hilarious, obviously just jokes.

1:04:14.780 --> 1:04:18.060
 Let me ask you, speaking of Tim Dillon.

1:04:18.060 --> 1:04:19.900
 A chaotic fucked up individual.

1:04:21.380 --> 1:04:23.380
 Can we go to your childhood real quick?

1:04:24.340 --> 1:04:25.740
 A brief stroll.

1:04:25.740 --> 1:04:28.580
 So your mom and dad split up when you were five

1:04:29.660 --> 1:04:32.180
 from a from a younging perspective.

1:04:32.180 --> 1:04:34.500
 If you look at your subconscious,

1:04:34.500 --> 1:04:37.100
 what impact do you think that had on you

1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:40.540
 in forming who you are as a man, as a human being?

1:04:40.540 --> 1:04:45.540
 Well, at the time, I thought that my father was like a hero.

1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:47.180
 You know, he was my dad.

1:04:47.180 --> 1:04:49.660
 I think every kid thinks like that about his dad.

1:04:49.660 --> 1:04:52.620
 His dad is like, your dad's your protector.

1:04:52.620 --> 1:04:54.660
 Your dad is like the coolest guy in the world.

1:04:54.660 --> 1:04:56.140
 That's what you like.

1:04:56.140 --> 1:04:58.300
 Yeah, yeah, everybody wants to be like their dad,

1:04:58.300 --> 1:05:01.380
 especially if your dad is like an imposing figure.

1:05:01.380 --> 1:05:04.220
 I remember one time me and my cousin got in a fight

1:05:04.220 --> 1:05:05.060
 over nothing.

1:05:05.060 --> 1:05:08.620
 It was like over who's tougher, King Kong or Godzilla.

1:05:08.620 --> 1:05:10.100
 Yeah, over nothing.

1:05:10.100 --> 1:05:12.300
 That's an important, but yeah.

1:05:12.300 --> 1:05:14.540
 And he said actual fight, actual fight.

1:05:14.540 --> 1:05:16.020
 Oh, I punched him in the face.

1:05:16.020 --> 1:05:19.220
 And this is when you were like five?

1:05:19.220 --> 1:05:20.060
 Yeah, yeah.

1:05:20.060 --> 1:05:20.900
 And so...

1:05:20.900 --> 1:05:22.140
 Which side were you on?

1:05:22.140 --> 1:05:23.540
 King Kong, okay.

1:05:23.540 --> 1:05:24.580
 I was wrong.

1:05:24.580 --> 1:05:26.540
 Godzilla's like way bigger.

1:05:26.540 --> 1:05:28.780
 Godzilla's 500 feet tall

1:05:28.780 --> 1:05:30.500
 and he shoots fire out of his mouth.

1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:31.340
 Yeah.

1:05:31.340 --> 1:05:32.340
 Yeah, are you sure?

1:05:32.340 --> 1:05:35.340
 I mean, there's an argument to be made.

1:05:35.340 --> 1:05:37.380
 It's not all about size, right?

1:05:37.380 --> 1:05:38.980
 No, there's no argument to be made.

1:05:38.980 --> 1:05:41.180
 500 feet tall versus 50 feet tall.

1:05:41.180 --> 1:05:42.940
 One's a gigantic dinosaur.

1:05:42.940 --> 1:05:46.540
 One is a stupid monkey who gets shot down by a plane.

1:05:46.540 --> 1:05:47.380
 You don't think a monkey can't ride?

1:05:47.380 --> 1:05:48.380
 You can't kill Godzilla.

1:05:48.380 --> 1:05:49.860
 Godzilla, like take him back?

1:05:49.860 --> 1:05:50.700
 No.

1:05:50.700 --> 1:05:52.820
 You can't kill Godzilla with a plane.

1:05:52.820 --> 1:05:54.140
 Rrrr.

1:05:54.140 --> 1:05:54.980
 Da, da, da, da, da.

1:05:54.980 --> 1:05:57.220
 Like that shit when working Godzilla,

1:05:57.220 --> 1:05:58.220
 killed King Kong.

1:05:59.820 --> 1:06:02.180
 King Kong and the new movies kept growing.

1:06:02.180 --> 1:06:03.140
 He's getting bigger and bigger.

1:06:03.140 --> 1:06:05.860
 Got to the point where he's as big as Godzilla.

1:06:05.860 --> 1:06:08.420
 It just feels like King Kong is stronger.

1:06:08.420 --> 1:06:09.260
 Oh, stop.

1:06:11.220 --> 1:06:12.580
 Backtake, backtake.

1:06:12.580 --> 1:06:13.900
 Immediate backtake.

1:06:13.900 --> 1:06:15.380
 You don't think there's a backtake?

1:06:15.380 --> 1:06:16.220
 There's a different.

1:06:16.220 --> 1:06:17.220
 If he's the same size.

1:06:17.220 --> 1:06:20.740
 Human weapons and two animals going at it

1:06:20.740 --> 1:06:21.580
 of a different size.

1:06:21.580 --> 1:06:23.660
 You don't think there's, in the jungle,

1:06:23.660 --> 1:06:25.460
 a smaller animal can take on a bigger animal.

1:06:25.460 --> 1:06:29.780
 Like a monkey versus a, let's see, a lion.

1:06:29.780 --> 1:06:31.380
 Monkey versus a bear.

1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:32.220
 What?

1:06:32.220 --> 1:06:33.060
 Who wins?

1:06:33.060 --> 1:06:33.900
 A monkey versus a bear?

1:06:33.900 --> 1:06:34.740
 Not a monkey.

1:06:34.740 --> 1:06:36.820
 What's the strongest ape?

1:06:36.820 --> 1:06:37.900
 A gorilla?

1:06:37.900 --> 1:06:39.500
 No, but gorilla, see, okay.

1:06:39.500 --> 1:06:40.740
 Gorilla can't do backtakes.

1:06:40.740 --> 1:06:44.500
 I'm thinking of like a smaller, you know what I'm saying?

1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:46.060
 Cause in Jiu Jitsu, you see this all the time.

1:06:46.060 --> 1:06:48.900
 Do you remember that scene in Talladega Nights?

1:06:48.900 --> 1:06:51.620
 Do you know Talladega Nights where the little boys

1:06:51.620 --> 1:06:53.420
 talking to his grandpa, I'll be all over you

1:06:53.420 --> 1:06:55.500
 like a spider monkey?

1:06:55.500 --> 1:06:56.580
 Exactly, spider monkey.

1:06:56.580 --> 1:06:58.220
 I was thinking, all right.

1:06:58.220 --> 1:06:59.180
 There's some animals.

1:06:59.180 --> 1:07:01.660
 Like here's a better example, a Wolverine.

1:07:01.660 --> 1:07:05.700
 Wolverines chase wolves and bears off of their kills.

1:07:05.700 --> 1:07:07.140
 And they're not very big at all.

1:07:07.140 --> 1:07:10.500
 They're just so ferocious and they're so durable.

1:07:10.500 --> 1:07:12.420
 Like it's very hard to kill a Wolverine.

1:07:12.420 --> 1:07:13.260
 Yeah.

1:07:13.260 --> 1:07:15.700
 And there's videos of like cats, like not actual,

1:07:15.700 --> 1:07:19.940
 like domestic cats or domestic dogs

1:07:19.940 --> 1:07:22.060
 starting shit with much larger animals.

1:07:22.060 --> 1:07:22.900
 Yeah.

1:07:22.900 --> 1:07:24.540
 And if they're ferocious enough.

1:07:24.540 --> 1:07:26.380
 Well pit bulls are a great example of that.

1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:29.060
 Pit bulls are small, like real game bread pit bulls

1:07:29.060 --> 1:07:31.260
 are like 35, 45 pounds.

1:07:31.260 --> 1:07:34.340
 And they'll kill much larger dogs.

1:07:34.340 --> 1:07:36.420
 Anyway, you were on King Kong's side.

1:07:36.420 --> 1:07:37.260
 Yeah, so.

1:07:37.260 --> 1:07:38.100
 You can shit out of your cousin.

1:07:38.100 --> 1:07:39.860
 I remember he said to me,

1:07:39.860 --> 1:07:41.700
 like I thought it was in like real trouble.

1:07:41.700 --> 1:07:44.700
 Cause I remember my cousin's mom was yelling at me

1:07:44.700 --> 1:07:47.580
 and it was like, you monster, all this crazy shit.

1:07:47.580 --> 1:07:52.300
 So my dad got me alone and he said,

1:07:52.300 --> 1:07:53.300
 tell me what happened.

1:07:54.260 --> 1:07:57.780
 And I told him, you know, we got in a fight.

1:07:57.780 --> 1:08:01.140
 We were arguing or King Kong Godzilla.

1:08:01.140 --> 1:08:04.740
 And I punched him in the face and he goes, did you cry?

1:08:04.740 --> 1:08:07.060
 I go, no, he goes, good, don't ever cry.

1:08:07.060 --> 1:08:12.060
 And I remember that like, whoa, okay.

1:08:12.540 --> 1:08:13.580
 And I remember thinking, all right,

1:08:13.580 --> 1:08:17.180
 I'm just going to start punching people because like,

1:08:17.180 --> 1:08:19.740
 obviously my dad thinks it's a good idea

1:08:19.740 --> 1:08:21.420
 if I go running around punching people

1:08:21.420 --> 1:08:22.700
 as long as I don't cry.

1:08:22.700 --> 1:08:27.700
 Like I remember certain things about, you know,

1:08:28.860 --> 1:08:31.100
 and also like this is it again,

1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:34.820
 like we're talking about watching Lenny Bruce

1:08:34.820 --> 1:08:38.740
 in getting a timeline of what the world was like back then.

1:08:38.740 --> 1:08:42.260
 This was a different world, you know, in 1970,

1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:44.420
 this would've been 1972.

1:08:44.420 --> 1:08:46.140
 It's a different world back then, man,

1:08:46.140 --> 1:08:48.940
 like a really different world.

1:08:48.940 --> 1:08:50.660
 It's some of that.

1:08:50.660 --> 1:08:53.180
 So Carl Jung talked about the shadow.

1:08:53.180 --> 1:08:56.660
 It's the unconscious where you have dark stuff

1:08:56.660 --> 1:08:59.540
 and oftentimes you use to project.

1:08:59.540 --> 1:09:02.980
 There's stuff that you're very self critical about yourself,

1:09:02.980 --> 1:09:05.260
 but because it's in your unconscious,

1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:07.500
 you use it to project onto others.

1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:09.500
 You see it as flaws in others.

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:12.020
 And that's a good way to, like whatever,

1:09:12.020 --> 1:09:15.580
 I guess a quote, like everything that irritates us

1:09:15.580 --> 1:09:18.740
 about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.

1:09:18.740 --> 1:09:22.900
 So that's a nice way to investigate yourself.

1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:25.380
 Like something that pisses you off.

1:09:25.380 --> 1:09:27.140
 You start asking questions of your own mind

1:09:27.140 --> 1:09:28.860
 and that's how you bring it to the surface.

1:09:28.860 --> 1:09:32.820
 But anyway, from that, those are formative years.

1:09:32.820 --> 1:09:35.540
 From that time, is there still stuff in your unconscious

1:09:35.540 --> 1:09:38.820
 you think you haven't examined, some dark shit?

1:09:38.820 --> 1:09:40.420
 I don't think so.

1:09:40.420 --> 1:09:43.940
 I don't, I'm not aware if it is, cause I've looked,

1:09:43.940 --> 1:09:47.660
 you know, like if someone, you know, someone says,

1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:50.580
 you know, I left something over your house,

1:09:50.580 --> 1:09:51.420
 like where'd you leave it?

1:09:51.420 --> 1:09:53.380
 I don't know, like, all right, I'll go look.

1:09:53.380 --> 1:09:54.220
 Yeah.

1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:55.900
 I'll get a real thorough looking.

1:09:55.900 --> 1:09:56.740
 But I'm pretty sure.

1:09:56.740 --> 1:09:57.820
 Pretty sure it's not there.

1:09:57.820 --> 1:09:58.660
 Yeah.

1:09:58.660 --> 1:09:59.500
 Yeah.

1:09:59.500 --> 1:10:00.700
 I don't know, I think I've looked.

1:10:00.700 --> 1:10:04.540
 I mean, it certainly hadn't, I think the positive effect

1:10:04.540 --> 1:10:07.980
 also was compounded by the fact that when my mother

1:10:07.980 --> 1:10:10.140
 married my stepdad, who's a great guy,

1:10:11.140 --> 1:10:15.180
 who was a hippie, very different, we moved around a lot.

1:10:15.180 --> 1:10:18.740
 And so the bad thing about that was I didn't really develop

1:10:18.740 --> 1:10:19.940
 longterm friends.

1:10:19.940 --> 1:10:22.100
 The good thing about that was that I was forced

1:10:22.100 --> 1:10:24.740
 to develop my own opinions about things.

1:10:24.740 --> 1:10:27.540
 Instead of adopting an opinion of the neighborhood

1:10:27.540 --> 1:10:31.660
 and the group about anything, I was forced to form

1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:35.820
 my own thoughts and opinions about almost everything.

1:10:35.820 --> 1:10:39.580
 And so it made me much more of an independent thinker.

1:10:39.580 --> 1:10:44.020
 So that on top of the fact that, you know, losing,

1:10:44.020 --> 1:10:47.340
 you know, my quote unquote hero very early on,

1:10:47.340 --> 1:10:50.820
 and then having to form my own opinions about things,

1:10:50.820 --> 1:10:54.940
 it left me with a very, very independent streak,

1:10:54.940 --> 1:10:56.180
 you know, in terms of,

1:10:56.180 --> 1:11:01.180
 and if I hadn't done the things that I got interested in,

1:11:01.220 --> 1:11:03.420
 martial arts and then comedy,

1:11:03.420 --> 1:11:05.140
 if I hadn't gotten interested in those things,

1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:06.620
 I would have been fucked,

1:11:06.620 --> 1:11:11.060
 because I was just too independent for normal jobs.

1:11:11.060 --> 1:11:12.820
 I was too independent for school.

1:11:12.820 --> 1:11:15.260
 I just didn't want to listen to people.

1:11:15.260 --> 1:11:16.660
 I was too feral.

1:11:16.660 --> 1:11:20.260
 I just didn't want to sit still.

1:11:20.260 --> 1:11:23.260
 If I was with the wrong parents, especially today,

1:11:23.260 --> 1:11:26.420
 I most certainly would have been medicated.

1:11:26.420 --> 1:11:28.900
 Yeah, there's so many possible trajectories

1:11:28.900 --> 1:11:31.020
 you can imagine where you would have not been

1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:32.260
 the person you are today.

1:11:32.260 --> 1:11:33.100
 Oh yeah.

1:11:33.100 --> 1:11:36.300
 This is probably one of the best possible trajectories

1:11:36.300 --> 1:11:37.140
 you're living.

1:11:37.140 --> 1:11:40.300
 This particular storyline you're living through

1:11:40.300 --> 1:11:41.580
 is one of the better ones.

1:11:41.580 --> 1:11:43.060
 This timeline is as good as it gets

1:11:43.060 --> 1:11:43.900
 for someone like me.

1:11:45.900 --> 1:11:48.300
 Is there advice you can give to people,

1:11:48.300 --> 1:11:52.100
 to young kids that are living through a shitty situation

1:11:52.100 --> 1:11:54.420
 of any sort, a tough life?

1:11:54.420 --> 1:11:56.460
 Find a thing you like.

1:11:56.460 --> 1:11:58.300
 Try to find a thing that you really enjoy.

1:11:58.300 --> 1:11:59.900
 Try to find a thing that you're passionate about.

1:11:59.900 --> 1:12:00.740
 Like an activity.

1:12:00.740 --> 1:12:02.780
 Yes, for me, early on it was drawing.

1:12:02.780 --> 1:12:04.100
 It was illustrations.

1:12:04.100 --> 1:12:05.300
 It was comic books.

1:12:05.300 --> 1:12:07.420
 I wanted to be a comic book illustrator.

1:12:07.420 --> 1:12:10.660
 And then it went from comic book drawing

1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:14.460
 and illustrations to martial arts.

1:12:14.460 --> 1:12:16.660
 So, but it was just another thing

1:12:16.660 --> 1:12:18.660
 that I was very, very passionate about.

1:12:18.660 --> 1:12:23.660
 And that was my vehicle out of my dilemma.

1:12:25.340 --> 1:12:29.500
 That was my vehicle out of my own anxiety and trauma

1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:34.500
 and my own issues and insecurities and find something.

1:12:35.700 --> 1:12:38.020
 Find a thing that you genuinely enjoy

1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:42.420
 because getting good at things you genuinely enjoy

1:12:42.420 --> 1:12:45.860
 is extremely beneficial for young people.

1:12:45.860 --> 1:12:49.740
 Because it lets you know that everybody thinks

1:12:49.740 --> 1:12:50.580
 they're a loser.

1:12:50.580 --> 1:12:52.180
 Every young person thinks they're a loser.

1:12:52.180 --> 1:12:55.140
 At least a young person in the situation I was at.

1:12:55.140 --> 1:12:58.420
 I didn't know I wasn't a loser until I started winning.

1:12:58.420 --> 1:13:00.100
 Until I started doing martial arts.

1:13:00.100 --> 1:13:03.660
 Martial arts taught me that I could get better at stuff.

1:13:03.660 --> 1:13:06.660
 That it wasn't, I wasn't really a loser.

1:13:06.660 --> 1:13:09.940
 I just was someone who was in a fucked up situation.

1:13:09.940 --> 1:13:11.940
 But you could channel all that energy

1:13:11.940 --> 1:13:14.580
 that you have as a young person into something

1:13:14.580 --> 1:13:15.580
 and get better at it.

1:13:15.580 --> 1:13:17.700
 And then all of a sudden people admired me.

1:13:17.700 --> 1:13:18.660
 I was like, this is crazy.

1:13:18.660 --> 1:13:23.660
 So I went from being someone who was incredibly insecure

1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:27.860
 and basically a failure to someone who was really successful

1:13:27.860 --> 1:13:30.140
 at this one thing that was very dangerous

1:13:30.140 --> 1:13:31.940
 that other people were scared of.

1:13:31.940 --> 1:13:35.020
 And that gave me immense confidence.

1:13:35.020 --> 1:13:39.500
 And also a real understanding of the direct correlation

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:41.940
 between hard work and success.

1:13:41.940 --> 1:13:44.620
 And a kind of understanding that you're not a loser.

1:13:44.620 --> 1:13:45.460
 Right.

1:13:45.460 --> 1:13:47.940
 There is some diamond in the rough.

1:13:47.940 --> 1:13:49.060
 Yeah. And also an understanding

1:13:49.060 --> 1:13:50.380
 that you can't listen to people.

1:13:50.380 --> 1:13:53.060
 Cause even my parents didn't want me to do martial arts.

1:13:53.060 --> 1:13:54.340
 They didn't want me to fight.

1:13:54.340 --> 1:13:55.860
 They didn't want me to just stand up.

1:13:55.860 --> 1:14:00.180
 There's like, you have to understand like who you are.

1:14:00.180 --> 1:14:05.180
 And then in the face of other people's either criticism

1:14:05.460 --> 1:14:10.460
 or lack of faith in your ability to succeed,

1:14:12.140 --> 1:14:15.100
 you push through and there's great benefit in that.

1:14:15.100 --> 1:14:17.580
 And then you realize that you can kind of apply that

1:14:17.580 --> 1:14:18.940
 to other things in life.

1:14:18.940 --> 1:14:20.340
 You can apply that to critics.

1:14:20.340 --> 1:14:23.180
 You can apply that to social media commentators.

1:14:23.180 --> 1:14:25.580
 You can apply that to a lot of things.

1:14:25.580 --> 1:14:30.500
 Okay. What about young people in their fifties?

1:14:30.500 --> 1:14:34.500
 Can you give advice to, like imagine you're sitting back

1:14:34.500 --> 1:14:37.980
 probably still here in Texas in your nineties looking back.

1:14:37.980 --> 1:14:41.380
 What advice would that guy give to you today?

1:14:41.380 --> 1:14:46.380
 Or like people that have done some shit in their fifties,

1:14:48.660 --> 1:14:50.780
 you've gone through a hell of a life.

1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:54.740
 There's potentially some incentive to settle down.

1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:57.140
 You got a great family to relax.

1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:01.540
 But maybe there's some incentive to still do epic shit.

1:15:01.540 --> 1:15:03.460
 Still be David Goggins running in the middle

1:15:03.460 --> 1:15:05.660
 of the desert screaming shit into a camera.

1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:09.180
 If you're David Goggins, you have to be David Goggins.

1:15:09.180 --> 1:15:11.900
 I don't think there's a path for that guy

1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:15.220
 that exists at this stage of his life other than that.

1:15:15.220 --> 1:15:17.420
 Do you think he'll be 70 and still screaming?

1:15:17.420 --> 1:15:18.900
 Yes. Okay.

1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:20.860
 100%.

1:15:20.860 --> 1:15:21.700
 100%.

1:15:21.700 --> 1:15:26.540
 If David and I are alive, we're both 70.

1:15:26.540 --> 1:15:27.980
 He's going to call me up and say,

1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:32.300
 stay hard motherfucker, guaranteed, guaranteed.

1:15:32.300 --> 1:15:35.020
 So lean into whatever the fuck you are at this point.

1:15:35.020 --> 1:15:36.620
 Well, if you're enjoying it,

1:15:36.620 --> 1:15:39.180
 but if you're not enjoying it, rethink your life.

1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:41.620
 Try to figure out why you're not enjoying it.

1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:44.700
 You still think it's possible to shift things in your fifties?

1:15:44.700 --> 1:15:47.740
 Yeah. If you're alive, you can get better.

1:15:47.740 --> 1:15:48.700
 No matter what?

1:15:48.700 --> 1:15:49.540
 Yeah, no matter what.

1:15:49.540 --> 1:15:51.700
 If you're alive, you can shift things.

1:15:51.700 --> 1:15:54.820
 I mean, if you're 90 years old and you have a month to live,

1:15:54.820 --> 1:15:57.460
 you can apologize for the things you think you did wrong

1:15:57.460 --> 1:16:01.980
 and maybe sort of reconcile and shape relationships

1:16:01.980 --> 1:16:03.860
 that you have with the people that are around you better

1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:07.220
 so that they feel differently about you after you're gone.

1:16:07.220 --> 1:16:09.500
 Yeah. I always love people in their 70s

1:16:09.500 --> 1:16:12.500
 who are like getting back into dating or something like that.

1:16:12.500 --> 1:16:13.500
 Yeah.

1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:15.740
 I was watching a video about a woman who's in her 60s

1:16:15.740 --> 1:16:17.620
 who just started powerlifting.

1:16:17.620 --> 1:16:18.460
 Nice.

1:16:18.460 --> 1:16:19.300
 Yeah.

1:16:19.300 --> 1:16:20.140
 And same with Jiu Jitsu.

1:16:20.140 --> 1:16:23.540
 You see people get into Jiu Jitsu like a white belt.

1:16:23.540 --> 1:16:24.940
 A white belt that's like 70.

1:16:24.940 --> 1:16:25.780
 Yeah.

1:16:25.780 --> 1:16:27.100
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:16:27.100 --> 1:16:30.540
 There's a lot of, if you're alive,

1:16:30.540 --> 1:16:32.420
 you can get better at stuff.

1:16:32.420 --> 1:16:35.740
 And I don't think people are happy

1:16:35.740 --> 1:16:40.260
 if they don't have puzzles and complex tasks

1:16:40.260 --> 1:16:42.020
 and things that are interesting to them,

1:16:42.020 --> 1:16:43.660
 whether it's an art project

1:16:43.660 --> 1:16:46.100
 or whether it's learning something completely new

1:16:46.100 --> 1:16:47.420
 like standup comedy.

1:16:47.420 --> 1:16:50.820
 Like doing things that are difficult is,

1:16:50.820 --> 1:16:55.580
 it's as much of a nourishment of the mind

1:16:55.580 --> 1:16:59.020
 as food is a nourishment of the body.

1:16:59.020 --> 1:17:03.940
 I think you need things that are puzzling to you

1:17:03.940 --> 1:17:08.820
 where you have to find your own human potential

1:17:08.820 --> 1:17:11.220
 in the difficulty of the task

1:17:11.220 --> 1:17:15.140
 and work your way through things, at least for me.

1:17:15.140 --> 1:17:17.060
 For me, I mean, I can only speak for me

1:17:17.060 --> 1:17:19.260
 because I'm the only life that I've ever lived

1:17:19.260 --> 1:17:20.300
 that I'm aware of.

1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:25.300
 And in my life, that has been 100% constant.

1:17:26.420 --> 1:17:28.340
 I am a very happy person

1:17:28.340 --> 1:17:29.620
 and I have never had a moment

1:17:29.620 --> 1:17:32.780
 where I'm not doing difficult shit ever.

1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:37.140
 What matters most is how well you walk through the fires.

1:17:37.140 --> 1:17:39.660
 You just keep starting fires for yourself to walk through.

1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:42.860
 Well, they don't necessarily have to be fires, right?

1:17:42.860 --> 1:17:45.660
 Because fires are like kind of out of control.

1:17:45.660 --> 1:17:47.780
 Lukewarm tasks.

1:17:47.780 --> 1:17:48.620
 The surfaces.

1:17:48.620 --> 1:17:50.220
 Tasks, give yourself something,

1:17:50.220 --> 1:17:55.220
 an arduous, difficult task where you're challenged.

1:17:55.220 --> 1:17:57.740
 Challenged mentally and challenged physically.

1:17:57.740 --> 1:17:59.900
 One of the great things about being challenged physically

1:17:59.900 --> 1:18:01.420
 is it's also mental.

1:18:01.420 --> 1:18:03.060
 The people that don't understand that

1:18:03.060 --> 1:18:05.020
 have never really been challenged physically.

1:18:05.020 --> 1:18:06.740
 People that think that physical challenges

1:18:06.740 --> 1:18:09.100
 are just physical.

1:18:09.100 --> 1:18:12.060
 It's just brute grunt work.

1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:12.900
 It's not.

1:18:12.900 --> 1:18:15.420
 It's emotional intelligence.

1:18:15.420 --> 1:18:19.140
 It's understanding your desired quit

1:18:19.140 --> 1:18:21.700
 and conquering your inner bitch.

1:18:21.700 --> 1:18:24.420
 All that stuff is mental.

1:18:24.420 --> 1:18:26.460
 It's playing out inside your head.

1:18:26.460 --> 1:18:29.580
 And there's a mental strength that you acquire from that

1:18:29.580 --> 1:18:32.620
 that you can apply to intellectual pursuits.

1:18:32.620 --> 1:18:36.100
 And the people that don't think that

1:18:36.100 --> 1:18:38.940
 are the people that haven't attempted them.

1:18:38.940 --> 1:18:41.500
 And there's an arrogance to people

1:18:41.500 --> 1:18:45.860
 that only pursue intellectual exercises.

1:18:45.860 --> 1:18:47.740
 Only pursue intellectual things.

1:18:47.740 --> 1:18:49.540
 And don't pursue anything physical.

1:18:49.540 --> 1:18:51.020
 That the physical stuff is base.

1:18:51.020 --> 1:18:51.860
 It's grunt work.

1:18:51.860 --> 1:18:53.020
 It's primal.

1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:54.260
 It's not necessary.

1:18:54.260 --> 1:18:56.380
 I don't think that's accurate.

1:18:56.380 --> 1:18:57.540
 I don't think that they're,

1:18:57.540 --> 1:18:59.740
 I mean, obviously these people like Stephen Hawking's

1:18:59.740 --> 1:19:03.980
 who have no opportunity to do anything physical, right?

1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:05.660
 His physical dilemma is keeping us,

1:19:05.660 --> 1:19:08.180
 or was keeping his heart beating.

1:19:08.180 --> 1:19:09.900
 But for most people,

1:19:09.900 --> 1:19:13.460
 I think you can really benefit from physical struggle.

1:19:13.460 --> 1:19:16.620
 And you benefit from it in a mental way.

1:19:16.620 --> 1:19:18.980
 And I think that is overlooked.

1:19:18.980 --> 1:19:21.780
 That's unfortunately overlooked by academics

1:19:21.780 --> 1:19:24.460
 and intellectuals who,

1:19:24.460 --> 1:19:28.020
 they make excuses for why they're fat and lazy or scrawny.

1:19:28.020 --> 1:19:30.100
 What they don't need to be,

1:19:30.100 --> 1:19:32.900
 it's not even about the fat or all of that.

1:19:32.900 --> 1:19:34.220
 It's like literally,

1:19:34.220 --> 1:19:36.500
 there's something about the physical challenge

1:19:36.500 --> 1:19:37.380
 that's really good for you,

1:19:37.380 --> 1:19:38.620
 especially if you're academic,

1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:41.180
 especially if you do intellectual types though.

1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:43.940
 There's this great roboticist at MIT, Russ Tedrick.

1:19:43.940 --> 1:19:47.540
 He runs barefoot to and from MIT every day.

1:19:47.540 --> 1:19:49.100
 I love it.

1:19:49.100 --> 1:19:51.580
 Like seven to 10 miles each way.

1:19:51.580 --> 1:19:52.420
 Barefoot.

1:19:52.420 --> 1:19:53.260
 Barefoot.

1:19:53.260 --> 1:19:56.300
 He studies legged locomotion, legged robots.

1:19:56.300 --> 1:19:58.020
 But for him, it's also interesting

1:19:59.300 --> 1:20:00.500
 how the human body moves.

1:20:00.500 --> 1:20:02.860
 He sees the beauty in all movement.

1:20:02.860 --> 1:20:04.700
 What do his feet look like?

1:20:04.700 --> 1:20:05.900
 You know, calloused.

1:20:05.900 --> 1:20:07.020
 Destroyed, right?

1:20:07.020 --> 1:20:08.380
 No, just calloused.

1:20:08.380 --> 1:20:09.220
 They're nice.

1:20:09.220 --> 1:20:11.060
 They form a nice,

1:20:11.060 --> 1:20:13.300
 it's not like I gave them a foot massage.

1:20:13.300 --> 1:20:15.820
 But I mean, they look,

1:20:15.820 --> 1:20:17.060
 and I don't have a foot fetish,

1:20:17.060 --> 1:20:22.060
 so I'm not able to correctly evaluate another man's feet.

1:20:22.060 --> 1:20:23.540
 I apologize for this,

1:20:23.540 --> 1:20:25.700
 but they don't look fucked up.

1:20:25.700 --> 1:20:27.780
 Does he run on concrete?

1:20:27.780 --> 1:20:30.020
 Yeah, he runs all surfaces.

1:20:30.020 --> 1:20:32.860
 And he does everything completely barefoot?

1:20:32.860 --> 1:20:34.940
 The running part at work.

1:20:34.940 --> 1:20:37.860
 So one of the things he has to do is fit into society,

1:20:37.860 --> 1:20:40.260
 which means he has to change clothes and appear normal.

1:20:40.260 --> 1:20:41.100
 Right.

1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:43.820
 So does he wear like zero shoes?

1:20:43.820 --> 1:20:46.260
 You know, those barefoot type shoes?

1:20:46.260 --> 1:20:48.660
 No, because that's like very happy,

1:20:48.660 --> 1:20:50.300
 woky type of thing.

1:20:50.300 --> 1:20:53.460
 No, like he doesn't, he's barefoot when he's running,

1:20:53.460 --> 1:20:56.180
 and then he wears like normal looking stuff,

1:20:56.180 --> 1:20:57.020
 like dress shoes.

1:20:57.020 --> 1:21:00.180
 How did he work his way up to running barefoot?

1:21:00.180 --> 1:21:02.940
 So he was significantly overweight.

1:21:02.940 --> 1:21:07.700
 And his advisor, this other famous person at MIT,

1:21:07.700 --> 1:21:10.620
 who was a roboticist, took his own life.

1:21:10.620 --> 1:21:13.100
 And that made him,

1:21:13.100 --> 1:21:16.420
 that made Russ face his own mortality, I think.

1:21:16.420 --> 1:21:18.940
 I mean, you start to ask big questions

1:21:18.940 --> 1:21:20.460
 about your wellbeing, like,

1:21:20.460 --> 1:21:22.820
 holy shit, that's where I can end at any moment.

1:21:22.820 --> 1:21:26.660
 And so he started taking his sort of physical wellbeing

1:21:26.660 --> 1:21:28.420
 seriously, but as a result of that,

1:21:28.420 --> 1:21:31.840
 not that he become like shredded,

1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:36.340
 but he's also discovered the intellectual value,

1:21:37.620 --> 1:21:40.860
 the humbling value of physical exercise.

1:21:41.820 --> 1:21:42.980
 He's not preachy about it all.

1:21:42.980 --> 1:21:46.500
 I don't think I actually rarely hear him advise it to anyone.

1:21:46.500 --> 1:21:50.460
 He just does it as a, almost like meditation

1:21:50.460 --> 1:21:51.820
 or something like that.

1:21:51.820 --> 1:21:53.460
 It's definitely a form of meditation,

1:21:53.460 --> 1:21:54.620
 and you can attest to that, right?

1:21:54.620 --> 1:21:56.300
 You do quite a bit of running.

1:21:56.300 --> 1:21:57.940
 There's a thing about a,

1:22:00.620 --> 1:22:03.380
 it kind of almost like a mantra gets formed

1:22:03.380 --> 1:22:04.620
 and you get into it.

1:22:04.620 --> 1:22:07.780
 No, it's great here in the Austin heat, 100 degree weather.

1:22:07.780 --> 1:22:09.220
 That tests you.

1:22:09.220 --> 1:22:10.780
 You know what I love to do outside?

1:22:10.780 --> 1:22:12.260
 Pull sleds.

1:22:12.260 --> 1:22:13.780
 That's my thing.

1:22:13.780 --> 1:22:15.620
 I love to pull sleds outside.

1:22:15.620 --> 1:22:16.460
 In the heat.

1:22:16.460 --> 1:22:17.900
 Yeah, did it today.

1:22:17.900 --> 1:22:18.740
 Yeah.

1:22:18.740 --> 1:22:19.900
 I love it.

1:22:19.900 --> 1:22:22.180
 So you're also, your wife is incredible.

1:22:22.180 --> 1:22:23.180
 You're in a relationship.

1:22:23.180 --> 1:22:26.060
 What, you're married, you have a great family.

1:22:26.060 --> 1:22:27.900
 What advice would you give to me

1:22:27.900 --> 1:22:30.820
 until there's like me who are dumb fucks

1:22:30.820 --> 1:22:32.660
 and I have not found a relationship?

1:22:32.660 --> 1:22:34.060
 Well, you're a great guy.

1:22:34.060 --> 1:22:37.340
 So this definitely doesn't necessarily apply to you,

1:22:37.340 --> 1:22:39.980
 but be someone who someone would want

1:22:39.980 --> 1:22:41.780
 to be in a relationship with.

1:22:41.780 --> 1:22:42.900
 There's a lot of people out there

1:22:42.900 --> 1:22:44.340
 that want a great partner.

1:22:44.340 --> 1:22:46.180
 They want someone in a relationship,

1:22:46.180 --> 1:22:49.620
 but why would someone want to be in a relationship with you?

1:22:49.620 --> 1:22:51.460
 Maybe you bicker a lot.

1:22:51.460 --> 1:22:52.700
 Maybe you're jealous.

1:22:52.700 --> 1:22:55.500
 Maybe you lie.

1:22:55.500 --> 1:22:59.940
 Maybe you, maybe you're cruel.

1:22:59.940 --> 1:23:02.740
 Maybe you don't have a sense of humor.

1:23:02.740 --> 1:23:05.100
 Maybe you're not kind.

1:23:05.100 --> 1:23:07.980
 Like what is it about you

1:23:07.980 --> 1:23:11.060
 that people would not enjoy being around

1:23:11.060 --> 1:23:12.380
 or the people avoid?

1:23:12.380 --> 1:23:13.580
 Fix that.

1:23:13.580 --> 1:23:15.820
 Well, this applies to me as well.

1:23:15.820 --> 1:23:18.260
 Like you said something with Cam Haynes,

1:23:18.260 --> 1:23:20.780
 one of the things you admire is that the discipline

1:23:20.780 --> 1:23:24.380
 takes to sort of juggle so many things and do it successfully.

1:23:24.380 --> 1:23:26.460
 I'm not sure I'm very good at that.

1:23:26.460 --> 1:23:29.700
 So juggling all this hard work and then also a relationship.

1:23:29.700 --> 1:23:31.220
 Also relationship, also family,

1:23:31.220 --> 1:23:32.700
 all these kinds of priorities.

1:23:32.700 --> 1:23:35.300
 I mean, that requires having your shit together.

1:23:35.300 --> 1:23:36.140
 It does.

1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:37.100
 It's a different thing,

1:23:37.100 --> 1:23:39.300
 but it's also you gotta find the right person.

1:23:39.300 --> 1:23:43.060
 There's a lot of people who settle for sexy.

1:23:43.060 --> 1:23:44.980
 They settle for hot.

1:23:44.980 --> 1:23:46.100
 They settle for the wrong person.

1:23:46.100 --> 1:23:48.500
 Like you can get hot and nice.

1:23:48.500 --> 1:23:51.940
 They're out there, but don't get hot and mean.

1:23:51.940 --> 1:23:53.300
 Hot and mean is not fun.

1:23:53.300 --> 1:23:54.500
 Then you get Amber Heard.

1:23:54.500 --> 1:23:56.580
 Yeah, and then you get hot and dry.

1:23:56.580 --> 1:23:57.980
 Yeah, yeah.

1:23:57.980 --> 1:24:01.660
 You can be deceived by perfect symmetry.

1:24:01.660 --> 1:24:03.060
 So you don't think it's a good idea

1:24:03.060 --> 1:24:04.700
 to record your partner?

1:24:04.700 --> 1:24:07.100
 I think you should record all conversations.

1:24:07.100 --> 1:24:09.220
 The CIA is doing it no matter what.

1:24:09.220 --> 1:24:11.620
 I assume that every conversation I have is recorded

1:24:11.620 --> 1:24:14.060
 because I'm pretty sure it is.

1:24:14.060 --> 1:24:15.700
 Even when we had dinner with Alex Jones,

1:24:15.700 --> 1:24:16.540
 he was recording.

1:24:16.540 --> 1:24:16.900
 Yeah.

1:24:16.900 --> 1:24:19.300
 I still remember that.

1:24:19.300 --> 1:24:21.260
 I didn't know they know that I was recording.

1:24:21.260 --> 1:24:24.860
 He might be funny if he is the CIA player.

1:24:24.860 --> 1:24:25.780
 He could be.

1:24:25.780 --> 1:24:26.860
 Could be.

1:24:26.860 --> 1:24:28.060
 That'd be the ultimate joke.

1:24:28.060 --> 1:24:31.860
 My advice about relationships is be somebody

1:24:31.860 --> 1:24:38.580
 and then also find someone who you can grow with.

1:24:38.580 --> 1:24:39.940
 You don't want to be with someone

1:24:39.940 --> 1:24:43.580
 who doesn't share your values.

1:24:43.580 --> 1:24:46.020
 You don't want to be with someone who makes excuses.

1:24:46.020 --> 1:24:49.900
 You don't want to be with someone who's lazy or who's spiteful.

1:24:49.900 --> 1:24:53.300
 You want to be with someone who's genuinely kind.

1:24:53.300 --> 1:24:55.460
 That's one of the things that I really love about my wife,

1:24:55.460 --> 1:24:58.540
 and she's very smart, and she works hard.

1:24:58.540 --> 1:25:01.020
 She's a dedicated, disciplined person,

1:25:01.020 --> 1:25:02.580
 but she's also really nice.

1:25:02.580 --> 1:25:04.860
 That's one of the things I like the most about her.

1:25:04.860 --> 1:25:06.020
 She's so nice.

1:25:06.020 --> 1:25:09.100
 She's always smiling.

1:25:09.100 --> 1:25:10.900
 And that energy is great.

1:25:10.900 --> 1:25:12.500
 Yeah, I mean, you've seen us together.

1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:13.540
 You've hung around with us.

1:25:13.540 --> 1:25:14.740
 She's fun.

1:25:14.740 --> 1:25:15.980
 Yeah, she's a lot of fun.

1:25:15.980 --> 1:25:18.620
 Yeah, she makes you just feel great to be alive.

1:25:18.620 --> 1:25:20.140
 It's good to have people like that around you.

1:25:20.140 --> 1:25:21.260
 She's happy.

1:25:21.260 --> 1:25:22.420
 She's a happy person.

1:25:22.420 --> 1:25:23.660
 She's happy to be around.

1:25:23.660 --> 1:25:25.780
 That's the kind of people that you could have in your life

1:25:25.780 --> 1:25:30.220
 as friends and as coworkers and as lovers and wives

1:25:30.220 --> 1:25:30.740
 and husbands.

1:25:30.740 --> 1:25:32.140
 You can find those people.

1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:32.980
 They're real.

1:25:32.980 --> 1:25:35.980
 And when you find those people, your life is better.

1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:39.100
 To have a good tribe is very important,

1:25:39.100 --> 1:25:41.180
 to have a good tribe of people.

1:25:41.180 --> 1:25:43.220
 And I think if there's anything that I'm very, very

1:25:43.220 --> 1:25:46.940
 fortunate about, it's the people that I'm around.

1:25:46.940 --> 1:25:50.820
 I have very good friends, and one of which is you.

1:25:50.820 --> 1:25:55.060
 It's so valuable to have quality people around you,

1:25:55.060 --> 1:25:58.060
 because it makes you want to do better,

1:25:58.060 --> 1:26:01.420
 because you admire the hard work that these people put in,

1:26:01.420 --> 1:26:05.260
 like Cam Haines or Goggins or many of my friends.

1:26:05.260 --> 1:26:09.700
 And people that are generous and people that are curious

1:26:09.700 --> 1:26:13.980
 and people that are honest, they inspire you to do the same.

1:26:13.980 --> 1:26:16.100
 And it's extremely valuable.

1:26:16.100 --> 1:26:18.700
 It's one of the most valuable things,

1:26:18.700 --> 1:26:21.900
 is to surround yourself with positive,

1:26:21.900 --> 1:26:25.660
 healthy, friendly, generous people.

1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:27.940
 That's why I cut out them dealing for my life.

1:26:27.940 --> 1:26:28.780
 I broke up with them.

1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:29.860
 I thought you guys were getting married.

1:26:29.860 --> 1:26:31.180
 No, it's over.

1:26:31.180 --> 1:26:32.220
 It's none of those things.

1:26:32.220 --> 1:26:37.260
 The nonstop conspiracy theories,

1:26:37.260 --> 1:26:44.140
 the nonstop mocking of my Eastern European origins,

1:26:44.140 --> 1:26:46.540
 is just not healthy for me.

1:26:46.540 --> 1:26:49.340
 Plus, he's physically abusive and a towering figure,

1:26:49.340 --> 1:26:52.540
 both in motion and physically.

1:26:52.540 --> 1:26:53.500
 No, I love him.

1:26:53.500 --> 1:26:56.780
 If he worked out, he would be a house.

1:26:56.780 --> 1:26:59.300
 He's got such a large frame, you know?

1:26:59.300 --> 1:27:03.340
 So if I interview Putin, what should I ask him?

1:27:03.340 --> 1:27:04.940
 How's the cancer?

1:27:04.940 --> 1:27:07.740
 How's it doing, buddy?

1:27:07.740 --> 1:27:10.140
 That's question number one in Russian.

1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:12.220
 Do you think he has cancer?

1:27:12.220 --> 1:27:13.580
 I don't think so.

1:27:13.580 --> 1:27:16.020
 The narrative is terrifying, right?

1:27:16.020 --> 1:27:19.020
 Dictator of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world

1:27:19.020 --> 1:27:22.820
 who also has cancer and he just invaded a sovereign country.

1:27:22.820 --> 1:27:24.140
 That's a terrifying narrative.

1:27:24.140 --> 1:27:25.180
 Because that's what we're all afraid of.

1:27:25.180 --> 1:27:26.820
 Someone who has nothing to lose,

1:27:26.820 --> 1:27:29.820
 who just decides to let loose a nuke.

1:27:29.820 --> 1:27:32.180
 Well, I do think maybe it's projecting,

1:27:32.180 --> 1:27:35.980
 but if I had cancer or if you think about leaders

1:27:35.980 --> 1:27:38.740
 that have cancer, you're facing your own mortality,

1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:42.380
 I would think he would be more focused on his legacy.

1:27:42.380 --> 1:27:46.380
 And dropping nuclear bomb is not good for legacy.

1:27:46.380 --> 1:27:49.420
 I do believe he wants to be remembered as a great leader,

1:27:49.420 --> 1:27:52.660
 as a lot of leaders do, as a lot of even dictators do.

1:27:52.660 --> 1:27:57.660
 And I think he wants to figure out a way to pull out a win.

1:27:58.900 --> 1:28:03.380
 So he can say that whatever this thing was,

1:28:03.380 --> 1:28:07.020
 whatever this invasion was, was good for Russia,

1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:08.340
 was good for the nation.

1:28:08.340 --> 1:28:11.580
 He ultimately made it a greater nation than it was before.

1:28:11.580 --> 1:28:15.420
 And perhaps you could justify an escalation of war to be that.

1:28:16.380 --> 1:28:19.940
 But I don't, and it's just the cancer thing

1:28:19.940 --> 1:28:23.660
 that concerns me so much because it's been so often

1:28:23.660 --> 1:28:25.900
 part of this propaganda that's been told

1:28:25.900 --> 1:28:27.460
 about Putin that he's sick.

1:28:27.460 --> 1:28:29.980
 I don't know why, it's always,

1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:32.860
 people kind of wonder that a lot about, especially dictators,

1:28:32.860 --> 1:28:35.380
 but you had that even like with Hillary Clinton

1:28:35.380 --> 1:28:39.940
 and obviously with Biden, that narrative is stickier.

1:28:39.940 --> 1:28:40.780
 So for some people it's stickier.

1:28:40.780 --> 1:28:44.180
 Well, that narrative is transparent and obvious.

1:28:44.180 --> 1:28:46.300
 But the degree of it is a question with Biden

1:28:46.300 --> 1:28:48.540
 as it does with everyone.

1:28:48.540 --> 1:28:50.780
 Like how healthy is this leader?

1:28:50.780 --> 1:28:52.340
 That's a question people often ask.

1:28:52.340 --> 1:28:55.460
 Sure, always, they were doing that about Trump too.

1:28:55.460 --> 1:28:59.340
 The thing about Putin though is like his appearance

1:28:59.340 --> 1:29:02.660
 is altered, where he looks very bloated.

1:29:02.660 --> 1:29:04.420
 His body doesn't look much bigger,

1:29:04.420 --> 1:29:07.380
 but his face looks like puffy and swollen.

1:29:07.380 --> 1:29:10.700
 I had a friend who had a sarcoidosis

1:29:11.900 --> 1:29:14.580
 and they prescribed prednisone,

1:29:14.580 --> 1:29:16.220
 which is a type of a steroid.

1:29:16.220 --> 1:29:18.260
 And one of the things that would happen when he was on it

1:29:18.260 --> 1:29:21.820
 is his face would get really big.

1:29:21.820 --> 1:29:25.780
 It was like, he would blow up like a swell up

1:29:25.780 --> 1:29:29.860
 and maintain a lot of water and inflammation.

1:29:29.860 --> 1:29:32.980
 And that's what it looks like when I'm looking at Putin.

1:29:32.980 --> 1:29:34.780
 So actually, like if you're sitting with him,

1:29:34.780 --> 1:29:36.900
 one question is about health.

1:29:36.900 --> 1:29:41.020
 That's, has Biden been asked that kind of question?

1:29:41.020 --> 1:29:42.700
 No, like without mockery, without any of that.

1:29:42.700 --> 1:29:44.220
 He would have to go on Fox News.

1:29:44.220 --> 1:29:46.740
 Like the mainstream media treats him with kid gloves

1:29:46.740 --> 1:29:49.580
 in a way that I've never seen.

1:29:49.580 --> 1:29:53.620
 It's so obvious there's something horribly wrong

1:29:53.620 --> 1:29:55.660
 with his cognitive function.

1:29:55.660 --> 1:29:59.300
 Well, to push back, I don't know if it's horribly wrong.

1:29:59.300 --> 1:30:00.380
 You don't think it's horribly wrong?

1:30:00.380 --> 1:30:02.340
 I think it's, no, I think there's uncertainty

1:30:02.340 --> 1:30:04.940
 to which degree is wrong.

1:30:04.940 --> 1:30:08.100
 I would love to there to be a serious conversation

1:30:08.100 --> 1:30:09.700
 about it with him.

1:30:09.700 --> 1:30:11.820
 In fact, I actually have to now look,

1:30:11.820 --> 1:30:16.820
 cause of course Fox News will mock his declining mental health.

1:30:19.100 --> 1:30:22.740
 And then I would love like sort of an objective discussion.

1:30:22.740 --> 1:30:24.060
 Are you aware of this?

1:30:24.060 --> 1:30:27.180
 Are you like, what are you putting in place?

1:30:27.180 --> 1:30:28.300
 Are you yourself?

1:30:28.300 --> 1:30:32.740
 Cause if I was a person with the declining mental abilities,

1:30:32.740 --> 1:30:37.380
 like you have to start thinking about that kind of stuff.

1:30:37.380 --> 1:30:38.860
 Like who is around you?

1:30:38.860 --> 1:30:40.420
 Who are the advisors?

1:30:40.420 --> 1:30:44.180
 What if you start, stop being able to see the world clearly?

1:30:44.180 --> 1:30:46.460
 I would be transparent about that kind of stuff.

1:30:46.460 --> 1:30:47.620
 Well, you would be,

1:30:47.620 --> 1:30:50.020
 but you also would never be a politician.

1:30:50.020 --> 1:30:51.980
 Cause you're too fucking honest.

1:30:51.980 --> 1:30:55.020
 Well, yeah, but actually from a conversation perspective,

1:30:55.020 --> 1:30:57.140
 it would be nice if that kind of discussion was had.

1:30:57.140 --> 1:31:00.100
 It would be, but all jokes aside with Putin,

1:31:01.780 --> 1:31:06.780
 I would ask questions about democracy versus what they have.

1:31:06.780 --> 1:31:11.780
 I mean, without, without any disparaging descriptions

1:31:13.460 --> 1:31:16.780
 of what is going on over in Russia,

1:31:16.780 --> 1:31:18.500
 it's clearly not a democracy.

1:31:19.860 --> 1:31:24.540
 It's, they, I mean, the way he has it set up,

1:31:24.540 --> 1:31:26.500
 the elections are a joke.

1:31:26.500 --> 1:31:27.340
 He's,

1:31:27.340 --> 1:31:28.220
 So he would push back.

1:31:28.220 --> 1:31:29.860
 That's not clearly not a democracy.

1:31:29.860 --> 1:31:31.020
 He is still very popular.

1:31:31.020 --> 1:31:33.780
 So majority of people are huge supporters of Putin

1:31:33.780 --> 1:31:34.940
 inside Russia.

1:31:34.940 --> 1:31:38.900
 The people that push back against that would say that

1:31:38.900 --> 1:31:41.660
 that's because any serious opposition

1:31:41.660 --> 1:31:43.020
 is pushed out of the country.

1:31:43.020 --> 1:31:43.860
 Yeah.

1:31:43.860 --> 1:31:45.540
 So in case competition murdered.

1:31:45.540 --> 1:31:46.860
 Yeah.

1:31:46.860 --> 1:31:48.980
 But yes, that's a really, really good question.

1:31:48.980 --> 1:31:50.780
 The value of dictatorships.

1:31:50.780 --> 1:31:53.220
 One of the things about the United States

1:31:53.220 --> 1:31:57.700
 that's fascinating to me is that every four years,

1:31:57.700 --> 1:32:00.540
 unless it's a, it's four to eight years, right?

1:32:00.540 --> 1:32:01.940
 If someone does two terms,

1:32:01.940 --> 1:32:04.340
 but every four years there's an opportunity

1:32:04.340 --> 1:32:07.900
 for someone to be new and completely inexperienced

1:32:07.900 --> 1:32:09.780
 at the most difficult job in the world,

1:32:10.900 --> 1:32:12.220
 which is ridiculous.

1:32:12.220 --> 1:32:16.460
 So the interesting thing is it actually makes sense

1:32:16.460 --> 1:32:19.380
 after eight years, you've gained the wisdom.

1:32:19.380 --> 1:32:22.180
 You would actually be a pretty good leader to keep going.

1:32:22.180 --> 1:32:24.060
 But there is some problem where you,

1:32:24.060 --> 1:32:26.100
 the power gets started getting to your head.

1:32:26.100 --> 1:32:26.940
 Yeah.

1:32:26.940 --> 1:32:29.180
 And so like from Putin's perspective,

1:32:29.180 --> 1:32:32.060
 I think he genuinely wants the best for Russia.

1:32:32.060 --> 1:32:34.780
 I don't think he's lost his mind

1:32:34.780 --> 1:32:37.340
 in terms of like it's all about greed and so on.

1:32:37.340 --> 1:32:38.220
 Same as Stalin.

1:32:38.220 --> 1:32:40.900
 I think Stalin until the end of his days

1:32:40.900 --> 1:32:43.300
 wanted the best for the Soviet Union.

1:32:43.300 --> 1:32:44.660
 So it's not like you become,

1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:47.140
 Hitler I think lost his mind during the war.

1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:50.020
 Like where it was like he wasn't seeing clearly at all.

1:32:50.020 --> 1:32:54.020
 What Putin believes is that he is actually the best person

1:32:54.020 --> 1:32:57.380
 to bring out the best for his country.

1:32:57.380 --> 1:33:02.100
 Now the problem is maybe refreshing the leader

1:33:02.100 --> 1:33:04.380
 is in fact in the longterm the best thing

1:33:04.380 --> 1:33:06.300
 versus every leader believes they know

1:33:06.300 --> 1:33:07.460
 what's best for the country.

1:33:07.460 --> 1:33:09.780
 What point is to keep refreshing it?

1:33:09.780 --> 1:33:10.620
 Well.

1:33:10.620 --> 1:33:11.980
 And that's the case for democracy.

1:33:11.980 --> 1:33:14.140
 That's the case for the system we have

1:33:14.140 --> 1:33:19.140
 that creates natural maybe emergent balance of power.

1:33:20.100 --> 1:33:21.100
 I think it makes it evident

1:33:21.100 --> 1:33:24.380
 that there is no clear cut real right way to do it.

1:33:24.380 --> 1:33:27.020
 And that if you had the perfect person in

1:33:27.020 --> 1:33:30.700
 having them for 12, 20 years would be amazing.

1:33:30.700 --> 1:33:34.100
 If you had a perfect benevolent leader

1:33:34.100 --> 1:33:36.220
 who clearly only cared about the people

1:33:36.220 --> 1:33:38.620
 was doing their best and striving hard

1:33:38.620 --> 1:33:40.540
 and got great satisfaction

1:33:40.540 --> 1:33:44.020
 in knowing that he is a dedicated civil servant

1:33:44.020 --> 1:33:47.580
 that only wants to lead the country in a way

1:33:47.580 --> 1:33:49.580
 that's gonna benefit the most people

1:33:49.580 --> 1:33:51.260
 in the most profound way.

1:33:52.500 --> 1:33:56.340
 But we have a dirty political system.

1:33:56.340 --> 1:33:58.220
 It's completely corrupted by money,

1:33:58.220 --> 1:34:00.140
 completely corrupted by influence.

1:34:00.980 --> 1:34:05.100
 The fact that the lobbyists,

1:34:05.100 --> 1:34:07.860
 I mean there's an area outside of Washington DC

1:34:07.860 --> 1:34:09.700
 it's one of the richest areas in the country

1:34:09.700 --> 1:34:11.420
 and it's where the lobbyists live.

1:34:11.420 --> 1:34:14.180
 There's so much money involved in being a lobbyist.

1:34:14.180 --> 1:34:17.900
 There's so much money involved in special interest groups

1:34:17.900 --> 1:34:22.900
 and how much of an impact they have on who gets elected

1:34:23.260 --> 1:34:26.100
 and what decisions get made once that person gets elected.

1:34:26.100 --> 1:34:27.380
 We know this, right?

1:34:27.380 --> 1:34:29.580
 We know it's not for the people by the people.

1:34:29.580 --> 1:34:30.940
 It's just not what it is.

1:34:30.940 --> 1:34:33.700
 I mean this country is an experiment self government

1:34:33.700 --> 1:34:36.980
 and if we could do it all over again

1:34:36.980 --> 1:34:39.220
 I would say the most important thing

1:34:39.220 --> 1:34:42.940
 is to have laws in place to keep money out of politics

1:34:42.940 --> 1:34:46.060
 and to make it a heinous crime

1:34:46.060 --> 1:34:49.140
 for someone to influence laws

1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:54.140
 and policy based entirely

1:34:54.140 --> 1:34:59.140
 on the amount of profit it could generate for a party

1:34:59.460 --> 1:35:04.460
 or for a company that is investing in a candidate.

1:35:04.460 --> 1:35:07.420
 That's fucking incredibly dangerous and it's corrupt

1:35:07.420 --> 1:35:09.300
 and that corruption has been accepted.

1:35:09.300 --> 1:35:14.020
 We've just accepted that this corruption exists, you know?

1:35:14.020 --> 1:35:17.620
 Last question, if Putin asks to see this watch

1:35:17.620 --> 1:35:19.260
 what do I tell him?

1:35:19.260 --> 1:35:21.700
 Would you give it, should I let him see it?

1:35:21.700 --> 1:35:23.980
 Cause we know what happens with the Super Bowl ring.

1:35:23.980 --> 1:35:26.700
 I think a Super Bowl ring is unique.

1:35:26.700 --> 1:35:30.260
 He could buy a watch like that, pretty easy, you know?

1:35:30.260 --> 1:35:33.260
 But this particular, isn't that a power move?

1:35:33.260 --> 1:35:34.100
 Yeah, but no.

1:35:34.100 --> 1:35:35.620
 So this is the watch you gave me.

1:35:35.620 --> 1:35:36.460
 Yes.

1:35:36.460 --> 1:35:37.300
 There's a story.

1:35:37.300 --> 1:35:38.140
 Yes.

1:35:38.140 --> 1:35:40.900
 I'll probably share it with him, the story.

1:35:40.900 --> 1:35:43.020
 And then maybe you go, look, can I see this watch?

1:35:43.020 --> 1:35:43.860
 Yeah.

1:35:43.860 --> 1:35:45.340
 And then he puts it on and says thank you.

1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:47.180
 Do you say no?

1:35:47.180 --> 1:35:48.020
 You go like this.

1:35:48.020 --> 1:35:49.180
 Yeah, there it is, bro.

1:35:49.180 --> 1:35:51.260
 Bro, take it off.

1:35:51.260 --> 1:35:53.100
 So many words I'm gonna have to find translation.

1:35:53.100 --> 1:35:56.660
 Buddy, bro, I guess bro is brother.

1:35:56.660 --> 1:35:58.820
 I mean, if he takes your watch, I'll buy you another one.

1:35:58.820 --> 1:36:01.420
 If Putin steals it, keep him going.

1:36:01.420 --> 1:36:05.140
 I'll just give you the same exact watch.

1:36:05.140 --> 1:36:06.660
 Well, first of all, thank you for this.

1:36:06.660 --> 1:36:07.500
 My pleasure, bro.

1:36:07.500 --> 1:36:09.900
 And I really wanted to talk to you

1:36:09.900 --> 1:36:14.580
 cause in a couple of days leaving to Ukraine and Russia

1:36:14.580 --> 1:36:18.900
 and I hope I'll be back in one piece

1:36:18.900 --> 1:36:21.420
 and drink whiskey with you once again.

1:36:21.420 --> 1:36:22.460
 Yeah, I hope so too.

1:36:22.460 --> 1:36:24.420
 I'm nervous about you going over there.

1:36:24.420 --> 1:36:27.420
 You know, I know journalists have been killed now.

1:36:27.420 --> 1:36:29.620
 It's, but they don't know Jiu Jitsu.

1:36:31.300 --> 1:36:33.500
 No, I think you'll be okay.

1:36:33.500 --> 1:36:35.460
 And I think there's certain things you do in life

1:36:35.460 --> 1:36:38.500
 that just kind of your heart pulls towards that so much.

1:36:38.500 --> 1:36:40.660
 What's your objective over there?

1:36:40.660 --> 1:36:43.700
 I'm not somebody who thinks about objectives clearly.

1:36:43.700 --> 1:36:47.340
 It's just something about me says I need to go there.

1:36:47.340 --> 1:36:49.980
 But to put in loose words

1:36:49.980 --> 1:36:54.980
 is to try to understand what that world is now.

1:36:56.420 --> 1:37:00.300
 So I remember what it was years ago when I was there.

1:37:00.300 --> 1:37:02.100
 I know my family,

1:37:02.100 --> 1:37:04.820
 I know the generations of family that was there

1:37:04.820 --> 1:37:07.620
 on that land in Ukraine and in Russia

1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:11.140
 and the soul of the people,

1:37:11.140 --> 1:37:13.620
 the love that's there, the beauty of the culture.

1:37:13.620 --> 1:37:15.660
 And I wanna see what it is today

1:37:15.660 --> 1:37:18.060
 and what this war has created,

1:37:18.060 --> 1:37:20.340
 both the anger and the love in the people

1:37:20.340 --> 1:37:22.340
 and just hear them out and just talk to them.

1:37:22.340 --> 1:37:24.060
 No recordings, none of that.

1:37:24.060 --> 1:37:25.420
 Maybe a little here and there,

1:37:25.420 --> 1:37:28.180
 but mostly just for me and to see.

1:37:28.180 --> 1:37:30.300
 I don't know, this sometimes is just,

1:37:30.300 --> 1:37:33.820
 something pulls you to a place.

1:37:33.820 --> 1:37:37.420
 And I also, because I'm able to speak Russian

1:37:37.420 --> 1:37:42.100
 and some Ukrainian, I do want to try to have these,

1:37:42.100 --> 1:37:45.420
 a couple of the political leaders involved talk to them.

1:37:45.420 --> 1:37:46.860
 And I have all the right connections.

1:37:46.860 --> 1:37:49.220
 Everybody has said, yes,

1:37:49.220 --> 1:37:51.620
 of course you don't know the likelihood it finally happens,

1:37:51.620 --> 1:37:54.500
 but I wanna at least have that possibility there.

1:37:54.500 --> 1:37:56.260
 You sometimes you have to go to a place

1:37:56.260 --> 1:37:57.340
 to really understand it.

1:37:57.340 --> 1:37:58.380
 You can't just read about it.

1:37:58.380 --> 1:38:00.540
 You can't just talk to the people that are living there.

1:38:00.540 --> 1:38:02.340
 You have to be there.

1:38:02.340 --> 1:38:05.060
 And I've never been in a war zone.

1:38:05.060 --> 1:38:10.060
 I've never been in a land that's been damaged

1:38:10.860 --> 1:38:15.500
 and wiped by the weapons of war.

1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:17.260
 And I just want to feel that

1:38:17.260 --> 1:38:19.300
 because so much of that land is,

1:38:19.300 --> 1:38:23.420
 I remember when everything was flourishing.

1:38:24.260 --> 1:38:26.140
 Yes, corruption, all those kinds of things,

1:38:26.140 --> 1:38:29.540
 but people were there and the culture was flourishing

1:38:29.540 --> 1:38:30.420
 and people were happy.

1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:32.420
 There was lots of struggle, but they were happy.

1:38:32.420 --> 1:38:34.820
 And now people are extremely angry.

1:38:34.820 --> 1:38:36.700
 There's hate in the air on all sides.

1:38:36.700 --> 1:38:38.660
 I wanna see that.

1:38:38.660 --> 1:38:39.500
 I wanna understand.

1:38:39.500 --> 1:38:42.020
 Sometimes it just pulls you and you have to go.

1:38:42.020 --> 1:38:44.740
 So it doesn't make any sense perhaps,

1:38:44.740 --> 1:38:45.860
 but you just gotta do it.

1:38:45.860 --> 1:38:47.660
 What's the timeline?

1:38:47.660 --> 1:38:48.660
 Of when I'm going.

1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:49.820
 How long?

1:38:49.820 --> 1:38:51.220
 No, one way.

1:38:51.220 --> 1:38:52.940
 I don't have a plan.

1:38:52.940 --> 1:38:53.900
 Wow.

1:38:53.900 --> 1:38:54.740
 Yeah.

1:38:54.740 --> 1:38:57.740
 So I'm hoping back in a month.

1:39:00.100 --> 1:39:02.940
 But also not just to clarify,

1:39:02.940 --> 1:39:05.100
 I'm not somebody who seeks risk.

1:39:06.020 --> 1:39:09.900
 And like you're somebody who seems to be terrified

1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:11.380
 of bears and sharks.

1:39:11.380 --> 1:39:12.220
 So you don't,

1:39:12.220 --> 1:39:16.980
 like so why go surfing, why go swimming in the ocean?

1:39:16.980 --> 1:39:20.180
 So I'm somebody that's the same, probably with sharks too.

1:39:20.180 --> 1:39:22.700
 I'm not taking unnecessary risk,

1:39:22.700 --> 1:39:24.940
 but certain things that just mean a lot to you,

1:39:24.940 --> 1:39:25.980
 you take the risk.

1:39:25.980 --> 1:39:30.220
 And so a little bit of risk willing to take

1:39:30.220 --> 1:39:33.420
 to discover something about myself.

1:39:33.420 --> 1:39:36.820
 Honestly, it's probably what all bull is down to,

1:39:36.820 --> 1:39:37.940
 try to understand myself.

1:39:37.940 --> 1:39:41.260
 Because so much of me is from that place.

1:39:41.260 --> 1:39:43.900
 Well, this is the beautiful thing about America

1:39:43.900 --> 1:39:46.300
 is it's like stitches together,

1:39:46.300 --> 1:39:47.460
 all these different cultures.

1:39:47.460 --> 1:39:49.020
 Everybody came from somewhere else.

1:39:49.020 --> 1:39:49.860
 Yeah.

1:39:49.860 --> 1:39:51.300
 And you try to understand,

1:39:51.300 --> 1:39:54.260
 in order for me to be a good American,

1:39:54.260 --> 1:39:57.700
 I need to understand who I was,

1:39:57.700 --> 1:39:59.060
 where I came from.

1:39:59.060 --> 1:40:04.060
 And that's nothing reveals the spirit of a people

1:40:04.580 --> 1:40:05.700
 better than war.

1:40:07.100 --> 1:40:10.020
 It's like there's something about this conflict

1:40:10.020 --> 1:40:13.700
 that's really cuts all the bullshit.

1:40:13.700 --> 1:40:15.020
 This is who we are.

1:40:15.020 --> 1:40:16.820
 This is who we are as a people.

1:40:16.820 --> 1:40:19.340
 So I want to see it, I want to understand.

1:40:19.340 --> 1:40:23.780
 And like I said, when I come back, drink some whiskey with you.

1:40:23.780 --> 1:40:24.620
 All right.

1:40:24.620 --> 1:40:26.140
 Well, I hope that happens.

1:40:26.140 --> 1:40:26.980
 I really do.

1:40:26.980 --> 1:40:28.380
 And I hope you're safe over there.

1:40:28.380 --> 1:40:30.500
 And I hope you come back with whatever insight

1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:34.140
 you're trying to achieve.

1:40:34.140 --> 1:40:35.300
 Thank you for doing this conversation.

1:40:35.300 --> 1:40:36.140
 My pleasure, brother.

1:40:36.140 --> 1:40:37.860
 Thank you for everything you've done for me,

1:40:37.860 --> 1:40:39.580
 for the support, for the love,

1:40:39.580 --> 1:40:41.140
 and everybody around you.

1:40:41.140 --> 1:40:42.180
 Thank you for everything you're doing

1:40:42.180 --> 1:40:43.020
 for everybody around you,

1:40:43.020 --> 1:40:46.980
 for giving back, but for just giving

1:40:46.980 --> 1:40:48.540
 and being kind to everybody.

1:40:48.540 --> 1:40:49.380
 I love you, brother.

1:40:49.380 --> 1:40:50.220
 I love you too.

1:40:50.220 --> 1:40:51.540
 Thank you.

1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:53.980
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joe Rogan.

1:40:53.980 --> 1:40:55.180

1:40:55.180 --> 1:40:57.780

1:40:57.780 --> 1:41:00.460
 And now let me leave you with one of Joe's

1:41:00.460 --> 1:41:04.380
 and one of my favorite quotes from Miyamoto Musashi.

1:41:04.380 --> 1:41:06.460
 Once you know the way broadly,

1:41:06.460 --> 1:41:09.340
 you will see it in everything.

1:41:09.340 --> 1:41:12.380
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
