00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
 The following is a conversation with Lee Smolin.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.520
 He's a theoretical physicist,

00:04.520 --> 00:06.680
 coinventor of loop quantum gravity,

00:06.680 --> 00:08.880
 and a contributor of many interesting ideas

00:08.880 --> 00:11.320
 to cosmology, quantum field theory,

00:11.320 --> 00:12.960
 the foundations of quantum mechanics,

00:12.960 --> 00:16.360
 theoretical biology, and the philosophy of science.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.160
 He's the author of several books,

00:18.160 --> 00:21.000
 including one that critiques the state of physics

00:21.000 --> 00:24.080
 and string theory called The Trouble with Physics.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.120
 In his latest book, Einstein's Unfinished Revolution,

00:27.120 --> 00:30.240
 The Search for What Lies Beyond the Quantum.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.880
 He's an outspoken personality in the public debates

00:32.880 --> 00:34.600
 on the nature of our universe,

00:34.600 --> 00:38.240
 among the top minds in the theoretical physics community.

00:38.240 --> 00:41.000
 This community has its respected academics,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.440
 its naked emperors, its outcasts and its revolutionaries,

00:44.440 --> 00:46.920
 its madmen, and its dreamers.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.560
 This is why it's an exciting world to explore

00:49.560 --> 00:51.800
 through a long form conversation.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.800
 I recommend you listen back to the episodes

00:53.800 --> 00:57.200
 of Leonard Susskind, Sean Carroll, Michio Akaku,

00:57.200 --> 01:01.200
 Max Stegmark, Eric Weinstein, and Jim Gates.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.880
 You might be asking, why talk to physicists

01:03.880 --> 01:06.160
 if you're interested in AI?

01:06.160 --> 01:08.800
 To me, creating artificial intelligence systems

01:08.800 --> 01:11.400
 requires more than Python and deep learning.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.360
 It requires that we return to exploring

01:13.360 --> 01:16.000
 the fundamental nature of the universe

01:16.000 --> 01:18.520
 and the human mind.

01:18.520 --> 01:21.200
 Theoretical physicists venture out into the dark,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.560
 mysterious, psychologically challenging place

01:23.560 --> 01:24.960
 of first principles,

01:24.960 --> 01:27.160
 more than almost any other discipline.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.880
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.160
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:33.160 --> 01:34.960
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

01:34.960 --> 01:36.240
 support it on Patreon,

01:36.240 --> 01:38.280
 or simply connect with me on Twitter.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.480
 Alex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.280
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now

01:45.280 --> 01:46.640
 and never any ads in the middle

01:46.640 --> 01:48.880
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.160
 I hope that works for you

01:50.160 --> 01:52.520
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.480
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:54.480 --> 01:56.760
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:56.760 --> 02:00.200
 When you get it, use code LEX Podcast.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.440
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,

02:03.440 --> 02:06.760
 and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.120
 Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,

02:09.120 --> 02:11.320
 let me mention that cryptocurrency

02:11.320 --> 02:14.640
 in the context of the history of money is fascinating.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.440
 I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.320
 Debits and credits on ledgers started around

02:21.320 --> 02:23.280
 30,000 years ago.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.960
 The US dollar, of course, created over 200 years ago,

02:26.960 --> 02:30.200
 and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,

02:30.200 --> 02:32.840
 was released just over 10 years ago.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.160
 So given that history,

02:34.160 --> 02:35.840
 cryptocurrency is still very much

02:35.840 --> 02:37.880
 in its early days of development,

02:37.880 --> 02:39.520
 but it still is aiming to

02:39.520 --> 02:43.000
 and just might redefine the nature of money.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.360
 If you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play

02:45.360 --> 02:47.840
 and use the code LEX Podcast,

02:47.840 --> 02:49.040
 you'll get $10,

02:49.040 --> 02:51.880
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to first,

02:51.880 --> 02:53.680
 one of my favorite organizations

02:53.680 --> 02:56.840
 that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education

02:56.840 --> 02:58.800
 for young people around the world.

02:58.800 --> 03:03.040
 And now, here's my conversation with Lee Smolin.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.040
 What is real?

03:05.040 --> 03:06.400
 Let's start with an easy question.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.320
 Put it another way.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.120
 How do we know what is real

03:09.120 --> 03:10.640
 and what is merely a creation

03:10.640 --> 03:14.160
 of our human perception and imagination?

03:14.160 --> 03:15.600
 We don't know.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.200
 We don't know. This is science.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.880
 I presume we're talking about science.

03:19.880 --> 03:24.240
 And we believe, or I believe,

03:24.240 --> 03:28.480
 that there is a world that is independent of my existence

03:28.480 --> 03:32.480
 and my experience about it and my knowledge of it.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.720
 And this I call the real world.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.080
 So you said science, but even bigger than science.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.120
 Sure, sure.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.320
 I need not have said this is science.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.480
 I just was warming up.

03:45.480 --> 03:46.440
 Warming up.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.800
 Okay, now that we warmed up,

03:47.800 --> 03:51.040
 let's take a brief step outside of science.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.400
 Is it completely a crazy idea to you

03:54.400 --> 03:56.400
 that everything that exists

03:56.400 --> 03:58.800
 is merely a creation of our mind?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.880
 So like, there's a few, not many,

04:01.880 --> 04:04.200
 this is outside of science now.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.520
 People who believe sort of perception

04:06.520 --> 04:10.000
 is fundamentally what's in our human perception,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.760
 the visual cortex and so on,

04:11.760 --> 04:16.240
 the cognitive constructs that's being formed there

04:16.240 --> 04:18.040
 is the reality.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.680
 And then anything outside

04:19.680 --> 04:22.480
 is something that we can never really grasp.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.080
 Is that a crazy idea to you?

04:24.080 --> 04:27.760
 There's a version of that that is not crazy at all.

04:27.760 --> 04:32.760
 What we experience is constructed by our brains

04:33.200 --> 04:36.220
 and by our brains in an active mode.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.920
 So we don't see the raw world.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.840
 We see a very processed world.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.520
 We feel something was very processed through our brains

04:47.520 --> 04:49.160
 and our brains are incredible.

04:50.160 --> 04:55.160
 But I still believe that behind that experience,

04:55.760 --> 04:59.440
 that mirror or veil or whatever you wanna call it,

04:59.440 --> 05:02.560
 there is a real world and I'm curious about it.

05:02.560 --> 05:06.760
 Can we truly, how do we get a sense of that real world?

05:06.760 --> 05:08.640
 Is it through the tools of physics

05:08.640 --> 05:11.440
 from theory to the experiments?

05:11.440 --> 05:15.360
 Or can we actually grasp it in some intuitive way

05:15.360 --> 05:20.360
 that's more connected to our ape ancestors?

05:21.260 --> 05:25.200
 Or is it still fundamentally the tools of math and physics

05:25.200 --> 05:26.520
 that really allow us to grasp it?

05:26.520 --> 05:29.080
 Let's talk about what tools they are.

05:29.080 --> 05:32.080
 What you say are the tools of math and physics.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.520
 I mean, I think we're in the same position

05:34.520 --> 05:37.920
 as our ancestors in the caves

05:37.920 --> 05:40.200
 or before the caves or whatever.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.360
 We find ourselves in this world and we're curious.

05:43.360 --> 05:48.360
 We also, it's important to be able to explain what happens

05:48.760 --> 05:50.840
 when there are fires, when there are not fires,

05:50.840 --> 05:53.720
 what animals and plants are good to eat

05:53.720 --> 05:55.040
 and all that stuff.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.680
 But we're also just curious.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.520
 We look up in the sky and we see the sun and the moon

06:01.520 --> 06:04.000
 and the stars and we see some of those move

06:04.000 --> 06:07.200
 and we're very curious about that.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.880
 And I think we're just naturally curious.

06:10.880 --> 06:15.880
 So we make, this is my version of how we work.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.080
 We make up stories and explanations.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.160
 And where there are two things

06:24.160 --> 06:27.640
 which I think are just true of being human.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.080
 We make judgments fast because we have to.

06:31.080 --> 06:36.080
 Where to survive, is that a tiger or is that not a tiger?

06:36.080 --> 06:37.480
 And we go.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.440
 Act.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.200
 We have to act fast and incomplete information.

06:41.200 --> 06:46.040
 So we judge quickly and we're often wrong.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.240
 We're at least sometimes wrong,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.160
 which is all I need for this.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.560
 We're often wrong.

06:50.560 --> 06:55.560
 So we fool ourselves and we fool other people readily.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.960
 And so there's lots of stories that get told

06:59.960 --> 07:04.320
 and some of them result in a concrete benefit

07:04.320 --> 07:06.120
 and some of them don't.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.400
 So you said we're often wrong,

07:09.400 --> 07:12.480
 but what does it mean to be right?

07:12.480 --> 07:17.480
 Right, that's an excellent question to be right.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.200
 Well, since I believe that there is a real world,

07:23.040 --> 07:26.320
 I believe that to be, you can challenge me on this

07:26.320 --> 07:27.520
 if you're not a realist.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.000
 A realist is somebody who believes

07:29.000 --> 07:31.280
 in this real objective world,

07:31.280 --> 07:33.080
 which is independent of our perception.

07:33.080 --> 07:37.680
 If I'm a realist, I think that to be right

07:38.720 --> 07:40.240
 is to come closer.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.240
 I think, first of all, there's a relative scale.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.480
 There's not right and wrong.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.960
 There's right or more right and less right.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.120
 And you're more right if you come closer

07:49.120 --> 07:53.080
 to an exact true description of that real world.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.840
 Now, can we know that for sure?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.080
 No.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.920
 And the scientific method is ultimately

07:58.920 --> 08:00.680
 what allows us to get a sense

08:00.680 --> 08:03.040
 of how close we're getting to that real world.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.160
 No on two counts.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.320
 First of all, I don't believe it's a scientific method.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.720
 I was very influenced when I was in graduate school

08:10.720 --> 08:12.600
 by the writings of Paul Firehub

08:12.600 --> 08:15.760
 and who was an important philosopher of science

08:15.760 --> 08:18.320
 who argued that there isn't a scientific method.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.160
 There is or there is?

08:19.160 --> 08:20.000
 There is not.

08:20.000 --> 08:20.960
 There's not.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.800
 Can you elaborate, sorry if you were going to,

08:23.800 --> 08:25.360
 but can you elaborate on the,

08:26.360 --> 08:28.840
 what does it mean for there not to be a scientific method,

08:28.840 --> 08:33.120
 this notion that I think a lot of people believe in

08:33.120 --> 08:34.880
 in this day and age?

08:34.880 --> 08:36.160
 Sure.

08:36.160 --> 08:39.800
 Paul Firehub, he was a student of Popper

08:39.800 --> 08:44.800
 who taught Carl Popper and Firehub and argued

08:46.960 --> 08:50.000
 both by logic and by historical example

08:50.000 --> 08:53.760
 that you name anything that should be part of

08:53.760 --> 08:55.080
 the practice of science.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.440
 Say you should always make sure

08:56.440 --> 08:58.480
 that your theories agree with all the data

08:58.480 --> 09:01.240
 that's already been taken.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.640
 And he'll prove to you that there have to be times

09:03.640 --> 09:07.360
 when science contradicts, when some scientist

09:07.360 --> 09:10.640
 contradicts that advice

09:12.440 --> 09:16.040
 for science to progress overall.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.320
 So it's not a simple matter.

09:18.320 --> 09:23.320
 I think that, I think of science as a community

09:25.240 --> 09:26.200
 and of people.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.600
 Of people and as a community of people bound

09:29.600 --> 09:34.600
 by certain ethical precepts, precepts, whatever that is.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.880
 So in that community, a set of ideas they operate under.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.720
 I'm meaning ethically of kind of the rules

09:43.720 --> 09:45.480
 of the game they operate under.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.040
 Don't lie, report all your results,

09:48.040 --> 09:51.040
 whether they agree or don't agree with your hypothesis.

09:51.040 --> 09:56.040
 Check, the training of a scientist

09:56.040 --> 09:59.320
 mostly consists of methods of checking

09:59.320 --> 10:01.480
 because again, we make lots of mistakes.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.240
 We're very error prone, but there are tools

10:05.240 --> 10:07.840
 both on the mathematics side and the experimental side

10:07.840 --> 10:11.000
 to check and double check and triple check.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.400
 And a scientist goes through a training

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
 and I think this is part of it.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.200
 You can't just walk off the street and say,

10:18.200 --> 10:22.280
 yo, I'm a scientist, you have to go through the training.

10:22.280 --> 10:27.280
 And the training, the test that lets you be done

10:27.560 --> 10:32.560
 with the training is can you form a convincing case

10:33.360 --> 10:37.800
 for something that your colleagues

10:37.800 --> 10:40.560
 will not be able to shout down

10:40.560 --> 10:42.520
 because the last, did you check this

10:42.520 --> 10:44.240
 and did you check that and did you check this

10:44.240 --> 10:47.680
 and what about a seeming contradiction with this?

10:47.680 --> 10:52.240
 And you've got to have answers to all those things

10:52.240 --> 10:53.800
 or you don't get taken seriously.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.520
 And when you get to the point where you can produce

10:56.520 --> 10:58.920
 that kind of defense and argument,

10:58.920 --> 11:03.920
 then they give you a PhD and you're kind of licensed.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.960
 You're still gonna be questioned

11:05.960 --> 11:10.640
 and you still may propose or publish mistakes,

11:10.640 --> 11:14.480
 but the community is gonna have to waste less time

11:14.480 --> 11:15.840
 fixing your mistakes.

11:15.840 --> 11:20.200
 Yes, but if you can maybe linger on it a little longer,

11:20.200 --> 11:25.200
 what's the gap between the thing that that community does

11:25.240 --> 11:27.640
 and the ideal of the scientific method?

11:28.800 --> 11:31.840
 The scientific method is you should be able

11:31.840 --> 11:33.840
 to repeat and experiment.

11:36.280 --> 11:40.560
 There's a lot of elements to what the scientific method,

11:40.560 --> 11:43.960
 but the final result, the hope of it

11:43.960 --> 11:48.000
 is that you should be able to say with some confidence

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
 that a particular thing is close to the truth.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.480
 Right, but there's not a simple relationship

11:55.480 --> 11:58.600
 between experiment and hypothesis or theory.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.120
 For example, Galileo did this experiment

12:01.120 --> 12:04.440
 of dropping a ball from the top of a tower

12:04.440 --> 12:06.880
 and it falls right at the base of the tower.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.480
 And Aristotelian would say, wow,

12:10.480 --> 12:12.800
 of course it falls right to the base of the tower.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.440
 That shows that the earth isn't moving

12:14.440 --> 12:16.760
 while the ball is falling.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.800
 And Galileo says, no weight is a principle of inertia

12:19.800 --> 12:22.320
 and has an inertia in the direction

12:22.320 --> 12:23.560
 with the earth isn't moving

12:23.560 --> 12:26.880
 and the tower and the ball and the earth all move together.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.120
 When the principle of inertia tells you at the bottom,

12:30.120 --> 12:33.080
 it does look at, therefore, my principle of inertia is right.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.960
 And Aristotelian says, no,

12:35.880 --> 12:39.440
 our style of science is right, the earth is stationary.

12:39.440 --> 12:44.440
 And so you've got to get an interconnected bunch of cases

12:45.640 --> 12:49.240
 and work hard to line up and explain.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.880
 It took centuries to make the transition

12:51.880 --> 12:55.920
 from Aristotelian physics to the new physics.

12:55.920 --> 13:00.920
 It wasn't done till Newton in 1680 something, 1687.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.000
 So what do you think is the nature of the process

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
 that seems to lead to progress?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.160
 If we at least look at the long arc of science

13:11.160 --> 13:13.440
 of all the community of scientists,

13:13.440 --> 13:17.040
 they seem to do a better job of coming up with ideas

13:17.040 --> 13:21.160
 that engineers can then take on and build rockets with

13:21.160 --> 13:26.160
 or build computers with or build cool stuff with.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.640
 I don't know, a better job than what?

13:30.280 --> 13:32.520
 Than this previous century.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.840
 So century by century, we'll talk about strength theory

13:35.840 --> 13:38.080
 and so on and kind of possible,

13:38.080 --> 13:41.200
 when you might think of us dead ends and so on.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.640
 Which is not the way I think of strength theory.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.920
 We'll straighten out, we'll get our strength straight.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.000
 But there is nevertheless in science,

13:48.000 --> 13:52.080
 very often at least temporary dead ends.

13:52.080 --> 13:57.080
 But if you look at the through centuries,

13:57.520 --> 13:59.200
 you know, the century before Newton

13:59.200 --> 14:01.160
 and the century after Newton,

14:01.160 --> 14:06.160
 it seems like a lot of ideas came closer to the truth

14:07.120 --> 14:10.320
 that then could be usable by our civilization

14:10.320 --> 14:12.960
 to build the iPhone, right?

14:12.960 --> 14:15.960
 To build cool things that improve our quality of life.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.520
 That's the progress I'm kind of referring to.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.480
 Let me, can I say that more precisely?

14:21.480 --> 14:22.320
 Yes.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.880
 It's a low bar.

14:23.880 --> 14:28.880
 I think it's important to get the time, place is right.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.160
 There was a scientific revolution

14:32.160 --> 14:37.160
 that partly succeeded between about 1900 or late 1890s

14:39.520 --> 14:44.520
 and into the 1930s, 1940s and maybe some

14:47.360 --> 14:50.280
 if you stretch it into the 1970s.

14:50.280 --> 14:54.520
 And the technology, this was the discovery of relativity

14:54.520 --> 14:56.120
 and that included a lot of developments

14:56.120 --> 14:58.320
 of electromagnetism.

14:58.320 --> 15:02.600
 The confirmation which wasn't really well confirmed

15:02.600 --> 15:06.560
 into the 20th century that matter was made of atoms

15:06.560 --> 15:08.680
 and the whole picture of nuclei

15:08.680 --> 15:09.880
 with electrons going around

15:09.880 --> 15:12.520
 and this is early 20th century.

15:12.520 --> 15:17.520
 And then quantum mechanics was from 1905.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.800
 It took a long time to develop to the late 1920s.

15:21.800 --> 15:25.280
 And then it was basically in final form.

15:25.280 --> 15:29.440
 And the basis of this partial revolution

15:29.440 --> 15:32.040
 and we can come back to why it's only a partial revolution

15:33.440 --> 15:37.040
 is the basis of the technologies you mentioned.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.840
 All of, I mean, electrical technology

15:40.840 --> 15:42.880
 was being developed slowly with this.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.000
 And in fact, there's a close relation

15:46.000 --> 15:49.600
 between development of electricity

15:49.600 --> 15:54.120
 and the electrification of cities in the United States

15:54.120 --> 15:59.120
 and Europe and so forth and the development of the science.

16:00.800 --> 16:05.800
 The fundamental physics since the early 1970s

16:08.520 --> 16:11.200
 doesn't have a story like that so far.

16:11.200 --> 16:16.200
 There's not a series of triumphs and progresses

16:16.560 --> 16:19.760
 and there's not any practical application.

16:19.760 --> 16:24.760
 So just to linger briefly on the early 20th century

16:26.600 --> 16:29.200
 and the revolutions in science that happened there.

16:30.400 --> 16:34.040
 What was the method by which the scientific community

16:34.040 --> 16:38.000
 kept each other in check about

16:38.000 --> 16:40.200
 when you get something right, when you get something wrong?

16:40.200 --> 16:43.640
 Is experimental validation ultimately the final test?

16:43.640 --> 16:45.400
 It's absolutely necessary.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.680
 And the key things were all validated.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.960
 The key predictions of quantum mechanics

16:50.960 --> 16:53.320
 and of the theory of electricity and magnetism.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.960
 So before we talk about Einstein,

16:56.960 --> 16:59.560
 your new book, before string theory,

16:59.560 --> 17:00.720
 quantum mechanics and so on,

17:00.720 --> 17:04.040
 let's take a step back at a higher level question.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.920
 What is that you mentioned?

17:06.920 --> 17:08.400
 What is realism?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.600
 What is anti realism?

17:11.640 --> 17:13.840
 And maybe why do you find realism

17:13.840 --> 17:15.720
 as you mentioned so compelling?

17:15.720 --> 17:20.720
 Well, realism is the belief in an external world

17:26.040 --> 17:28.720
 independent of our existence, our perception,

17:28.720 --> 17:30.760
 our belief, our knowledge.

17:30.760 --> 17:35.560
 A realist as a physicist is somebody who believes

17:35.560 --> 17:40.560
 that there should be possible some completely objective

17:40.680 --> 17:44.800
 description of each and every process

17:44.800 --> 17:46.840
 at the fundamental level,

17:46.840 --> 17:51.040
 which describes and explains exactly what happens

17:51.040 --> 17:52.840
 and why it happens.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.720
 That kind of implies that that system

17:55.720 --> 17:58.320
 in a realist view is deterministic,

17:58.320 --> 18:01.160
 meaning there's no fuzzy magic going on

18:01.160 --> 18:02.320
 that you can never get to the bottom.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.320
 You can get to the bottom of anything

18:04.320 --> 18:06.280
 and perfectly describe it.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.760
 Some people would say that I'm not that interested

18:10.760 --> 18:14.520
 in determinism, but I could live with

18:14.520 --> 18:18.600
 the fundamental world which had some chance in it.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.840
 So you said you could live with it,

18:21.840 --> 18:26.600
 but do you think God plays dice in our universe?

18:26.600 --> 18:28.640
 I think it's probably much worse than that.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.160
 In which direction?

18:32.160 --> 18:34.000
 I think that theories can change

18:34.000 --> 18:36.200
 and theories can change without warning.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.560
 I think the future is open.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.000
 You mean the fundamental laws of physics can change?

18:41.000 --> 18:41.840
 Yeah.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.840
 Okay, we'll get there.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.680
 I thought we would be able to find some solid ground,

18:49.680 --> 18:52.960
 but apparently the entirety of it,

18:52.960 --> 18:55.160
 temporarily so, probably.

18:55.160 --> 18:59.920
 Okay, so realism is the idea that

18:59.920 --> 19:02.880
 while the ground is solid, you can describe it.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.640
 What's the role of the human being,

19:04.640 --> 19:09.640
 our beautiful complex human mind in realism?

19:09.640 --> 19:13.640
 Are we just another set of molecules

19:13.640 --> 19:15.640
 connected together in a clever way,

19:15.640 --> 19:19.640
 or the observer, does the observer,

19:19.640 --> 19:22.640
 our human mind, consciousness, have a role in this

19:22.640 --> 19:25.640
 realism view of the physical universe?

19:26.640 --> 19:29.640
 There's two questions you could be asking.

19:30.640 --> 19:34.640
 Does our conscious mind, do our perceptions

19:34.640 --> 19:37.640
 play a role in making things become,

19:37.640 --> 19:41.640
 in making things real or things becoming?

19:41.640 --> 19:42.640
 That's question one.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.640
 Question two is, does this,

19:45.640 --> 19:49.640
 we can call it a naturalist view of the world

19:50.640 --> 19:53.640
 that is based on realism,

19:53.640 --> 19:57.640
 allow a place to understand the existence of

19:57.640 --> 20:00.640
 and the nature of perceptions and consciousness in mind?

20:00.640 --> 20:02.640
 And that's question two.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.640
 Question two, I do think a lot about,

20:05.640 --> 20:08.640
 and my answer, which is not an answer,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.640
 is I hope so, but it certainly doesn't yet.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.640
 Question one, I don't think so.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.640
 But of course, the answer to question one

20:17.640 --> 20:19.640
 depends on question two.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.640
 So I'm not up to question one yet.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.640
 So question two is the thing that you can kind of

20:24.640 --> 20:26.640
 struggle with at this time.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.640
 What about the anti realists?

20:30.640 --> 20:34.640
 So what flavor, what are the differences

20:34.640 --> 20:35.640
 in the flavor?

20:35.640 --> 20:37.640
 What are the different camps of anti realists

20:37.640 --> 20:38.640
 that you've talked about?

20:38.640 --> 20:41.640
 I think it would be nice if you can articulate

20:42.640 --> 20:45.640
 for the people for whom there is not a very concrete

20:45.640 --> 20:48.640
 real world, if there's divisions or there's a,

20:48.640 --> 20:52.640
 it's messier than the realist view of the universe.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.640
 What are the different camps?

20:53.640 --> 20:54.640
 What are the different views?

20:54.640 --> 20:57.640
 I'm not sure, I'm a good scholar

20:57.640 --> 20:59.640
 and can talk about the different camps

20:59.640 --> 21:00.640
 and analyze it.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.640
 Many of the inventors of quantum physics

21:04.640 --> 21:06.640
 were not realists, were anti realists.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.640
 They lived in a very perilous time

21:10.640 --> 21:12.640
 between the two world wars

21:13.640 --> 21:16.640
 and there were a lot of trends in culture

21:16.640 --> 21:18.640
 which were going that way.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.640
 But in any case, they said things like

21:23.640 --> 21:25.640
 the purpose of science is not to give

21:25.640 --> 21:28.640
 an objective realist description of nature

21:28.640 --> 21:30.640
 as it would be in our absence.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.640
 This might be saying Niels Bohr,

21:32.640 --> 21:35.640
 the purpose of science is as an extension

21:35.640 --> 21:38.640
 of our conversations with each other

21:38.640 --> 21:40.640
 to describe our interactions with nature

21:40.640 --> 21:43.640
 and we're free to invent and use terms

21:43.640 --> 21:46.640
 like particle or wave or causality

21:46.640 --> 21:48.640
 or time or space.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.640
 If they're useful to us

21:51.640 --> 21:55.640
 and they carry some intuitive implication

21:55.640 --> 21:58.640
 but we shouldn't believe that they actually

21:58.640 --> 22:00.640
 have to do with what nature would be like

22:00.640 --> 22:04.640
 in our absence, which we have nothing to say about.

22:04.640 --> 22:07.640
 Do you find any aspect of that?

22:07.640 --> 22:09.640
 Because you kind of said that we human beings

22:09.640 --> 22:11.640
 tell stories.

22:11.640 --> 22:14.640
 Do you find aspects of that kind of

22:14.640 --> 22:17.640
 anti realist view of Niels Bohr compelling

22:17.640 --> 22:20.640
 that we're fundamentally our storytellers

22:20.640 --> 22:24.640
 and then we create tools of space and time

22:24.640 --> 22:28.640
 and causality and whatever this fun quantum

22:28.640 --> 22:30.640
 mechanic stuff is to help us tell the story

22:30.640 --> 22:32.640
 of our world?

22:32.640 --> 22:35.640
 Sure, I just would like to believe that

22:35.640 --> 22:38.640
 it is an aspiration for the other thing.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.640
 The other thing being what?

22:40.640 --> 22:43.640
 The realist point of view.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.640
 Do you hope that the stories will eventually

22:45.640 --> 22:55.640
 lead us to discovering the real world as it is?

22:55.640 --> 22:57.640
 Yeah.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.640
 It's perfection possible by the way, is it?

22:59.640 --> 23:01.640
 No.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.640
 You mean will we ever get there and know that we're there?

23:04.640 --> 23:06.640
 Yeah, exactly.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.640
 That's for people 5,000 years in the future.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.640
 We're certainly nowhere near there yet.

23:12.640 --> 23:19.640
 Do you think reality that exists outside of our mind,

23:19.640 --> 23:24.640
 do you think there's a limit to our cognitive abilities,

23:24.640 --> 23:28.640
 again the sentence of apes for just biological systems,

23:28.640 --> 23:31.640
 is there a limit to our mind's capability

23:31.640 --> 23:34.640
 to actually understand reality?

23:34.640 --> 23:40.640
 There comes a point even with the help of the

23:40.640 --> 23:44.640
 tools of physics that we just cannot grasp

23:44.640 --> 23:46.640
 some fundamental aspects of that reality.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.640
 Again, I think that's a question for 5,000 years in the future.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.640
 We're not even close to that limit.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.640
 I think there is a universality.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.640
 Here, I don't agree with David Deutsch about everything,

23:56.640 --> 24:00.640
 but I admire the way he put things in his last book

24:00.640 --> 24:03.640
 and he talked about the role of explanation

24:03.640 --> 24:06.640
 and he talked about the universality

24:06.640 --> 24:10.640
 of certain languages or the universality of mathematics

24:10.640 --> 24:14.640
 or of computing and so forth.

24:14.640 --> 24:18.640
 He believed that universality, which is something real,

24:18.640 --> 24:23.640
 which somehow comes out of the fact that a symbolic system

24:23.640 --> 24:26.640
 or a mathematical system can refer to itself

24:26.640 --> 24:29.640
 and can, I forget what that's called,

24:29.640 --> 24:31.640
 can reference back to itself.

24:31.640 --> 24:36.640
 And build in which he argued for a universality

24:36.640 --> 24:41.640
 of possibility for our understanding, whatever is out there.

24:41.640 --> 24:47.640
 I admire that argument, but it seems to me

24:47.640 --> 24:53.640
 we're doing okay so far, but we'll have to see.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.640
 Whether there is a limit or not,

24:55.640 --> 24:57.640
 for now we've got plenty to play with.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.640
 There are things which are right there in front of us.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.640
 Which we miss.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.640
 And I'll quote my friend, Derek Weinstein,

25:05.640 --> 25:09.640
 in saying, look, Einstein carried his luggage.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.640
 Freud carried his luggage.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.640
 Marx carried his luggage.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.640
 Martha Graham carried her luggage.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.640
 Et cetera.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.640
 Edison carried his luggage.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.640
 All these geniuses carried their luggage.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.640
 Not once before, relatively recently,

25:24.640 --> 25:29.640
 did it occur to anybody to put a wheel on luggage and pull it.

25:29.640 --> 25:34.640
 And it was right there waiting to be invented for centuries.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.640
 So this is Eric Weinstein.

25:37.640 --> 25:38.640
 Yeah.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.640
 What do the wheels represent?

25:40.640 --> 25:43.640
 Are you basically saying that there's stuff right in front of our eyes

25:43.640 --> 25:47.640
 that once it just clicks, we put the wheels in the luggage,

25:47.640 --> 25:49.640
 a lot of things will fall into place?

25:49.640 --> 25:51.640
 Yes, I do.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.640
 And every day I wake up and think,

25:54.640 --> 25:58.640
 why can't I be that guy who was walking through the airport?

25:58.640 --> 26:02.640
 What do you think it takes to be that guy?

26:02.640 --> 26:05.640
 Because, like you said,

26:05.640 --> 26:08.640
 a lot of really smart people carry their luggage.

26:08.640 --> 26:12.640
 What, just psychologically speaking,

26:12.640 --> 26:15.640
 so Eric Weinstein is a good example of a person who thinks outside the box.

26:15.640 --> 26:16.640
 Yes.

26:16.640 --> 26:20.640
 Who resists almost conventional thinking.

26:20.640 --> 26:26.640
 You're an example of a person who, by habit, by psychology,

26:26.640 --> 26:28.640
 by upbringing, I don't know,

26:28.640 --> 26:31.640
 but resists conventional thinking as well, just by nature.

26:31.640 --> 26:32.640
 Thank you.

26:32.640 --> 26:33.640
 That's a compliment.

26:33.640 --> 26:34.640
 That's a compliment? Good.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.640
 So what do you think it takes to do that?

26:36.640 --> 26:39.640
 Is that something you were just born with?

26:39.640 --> 26:41.640
 I doubt it.

26:41.640 --> 26:46.640
 Well, from my studying some cases,

26:46.640 --> 26:49.640
 because I'm curious about that, obviously.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.640
 And just in a more concrete way,

26:51.640 --> 26:53.640
 when I started out in physics,

26:53.640 --> 26:57.640
 because I started a long way from physics,

26:57.640 --> 27:00.640
 so it took me a long, not a long time,

27:00.640 --> 27:03.640
 but a lot of work to get to study it and get into it.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.640
 So I did wonder about that.

27:06.640 --> 27:09.640
 And so I read the biographies,

27:09.640 --> 27:12.640
 and in fact, I started with the autobiography of Weinstein

27:12.640 --> 27:17.640
 and Newton and Galileo and all those people.

27:17.640 --> 27:21.640
 And I think there's a couple of things.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.640
 Some of it is luck being in the right place at the right time.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.640
 Some of it is stubbornness and arrogance,

27:28.640 --> 27:30.640
 which can easily go wrong.

27:30.640 --> 27:35.640
 And I know all of these are doorways.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.640
 If you go through them slightly at the wrong speed

27:38.640 --> 27:44.640
 or in the wrong angle, there are ways to fail.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.640
 But if you somehow have the right luck,

27:47.640 --> 27:49.640
 the right confidence and arrogance,

27:49.640 --> 27:51.640
 caring.

27:51.640 --> 27:55.640
 I think Weinstein cared to understand nature

27:55.640 --> 27:59.640
 with a ferocity and a commitment

27:59.640 --> 28:01.640
 that exceeded other people of his time.

28:01.640 --> 28:04.640
 So he asked more stubborn questions.

28:04.640 --> 28:09.640
 He asked deeper questions.

28:09.640 --> 28:14.640
 I think, and there's a level of ability

28:14.640 --> 28:18.640
 and whether ability is born in

28:18.640 --> 28:21.640
 or can be developed to the extent to which it can be developed,

28:21.640 --> 28:24.640
 like any of these things, like musical talent.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.640
 You mentioned ego.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.640
 What's the role of ego in that process?

28:28.640 --> 28:30.640
 Confidence.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.640
 But in your own life,

28:33.640 --> 28:37.640
 have you found yourself walking that nice edge of too much

28:37.640 --> 28:40.640
 or too little, so being overconfident

28:40.640 --> 28:42.640
 and therefore leaning yourself astray

28:42.640 --> 28:45.640
 or not sufficiently confident to throw away

28:45.640 --> 28:48.640
 the conventional thinking of whatever the theory of the day,

28:48.640 --> 28:50.640
 of theoretical physics?

28:50.640 --> 28:52.640
 I don't know if...

28:52.640 --> 28:55.640
 I mean, I've contributed what I've contributed,

28:55.640 --> 28:59.640
 whether if I had had more confidence in something,

28:59.640 --> 29:01.640
 I would have gotten further.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.640
 I don't know.

29:03.640 --> 29:09.640
 Certainly, I'm sitting here at this moment

29:09.640 --> 29:14.640
 with very much my own approach to nearly everything.

29:14.640 --> 29:18.640
 When I'm calm, I'm happy about that.

29:18.640 --> 29:22.640
 But on the other hand, I know people

29:22.640 --> 29:26.640
 whose self confidence vastly exceeds mine

29:26.640 --> 29:28.640
 and sometimes I think it's justified

29:28.640 --> 29:32.640
 and sometimes I think it's not justified.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.640
 Your most recent book titled,

29:34.640 --> 29:37.640
 Einstein's Unfinished Revolution.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.640
 So I have to ask,

29:39.640 --> 29:42.640
 what is Einstein's Unfinished Revolution

29:42.640 --> 29:45.640
 and also how do we finish it?

29:45.640 --> 29:48.640
 Well, that's something I've been trying to do my whole life.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.640
 But Einstein's Unfinished Revolution

29:50.640 --> 29:54.640
 is the twin revolutions which invented relativity theories,

29:54.640 --> 29:57.640
 special and especially general relativity,

29:57.640 --> 29:59.640
 and quantum theory,

29:59.640 --> 30:03.640
 which he was the first person to realize in 1905

30:03.640 --> 30:07.640
 that there would have to be a radically different theory

30:07.640 --> 30:11.640
 which somehow realized or resolved the paradox

30:11.640 --> 30:15.640
 of duality of particle and wave for photons.

30:15.640 --> 30:19.640
 People, I think, don't always associate Einstein

30:19.640 --> 30:21.640
 with quantum mechanics

30:21.640 --> 30:25.640
 because I think his connection with it,

30:25.640 --> 30:28.640
 as one of the founders, I would say, of quantum mechanics,

30:28.640 --> 30:30.640
 he kind of put it in the closet.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.640
 Well, he didn't believe that the quantum mechanics,

30:33.640 --> 30:37.640
 as it was developed in the mid to late 1920s,

30:37.640 --> 30:39.640
 was completely correct.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.640
 At first, he didn't believe it at all.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.640
 Then he was convinced that it's consistent but incomplete

30:45.640 --> 30:47.640
 and that also is my view.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.640
 It needs, for various reasons,

30:50.640 --> 30:52.640
 I can elucidate,

30:52.640 --> 30:56.640
 to have additional degrees of freedom,

30:56.640 --> 30:59.640
 particles, forces, something

30:59.640 --> 31:02.640
 to reach the stage where it gives a complete description

31:02.640 --> 31:05.640
 of each phenomenon as I was saying,

31:05.640 --> 31:07.640
 realism, demands.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.640
 So what aspect of quantum mechanics

31:09.640 --> 31:12.640
 bothers you and Einstein the most?

31:12.640 --> 31:16.640
 Is it some aspect of the wave function

31:16.640 --> 31:19.640
 collapse discussions, the measurement problem?

31:19.640 --> 31:22.640
 Is it the...

31:22.640 --> 31:24.640
 The measurement problem.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.640
 I'm not going to speak for Einstein.

31:26.640 --> 31:30.640
 The measurement problem, basically,

31:30.640 --> 31:32.640
 and the fact that...

31:32.640 --> 31:34.640
 What is the measurement problem, sorry?

31:34.640 --> 31:37.640
 The basic formulation of quantum mechanics

31:37.640 --> 31:41.640
 gives you two ways to evolve situations and time.

31:41.640 --> 31:45.640
 One of them is explicitly when no observer is observing

31:45.640 --> 31:47.640
 or no measurement is taking place.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.640
 And the other is when a measurement or an observation

31:49.640 --> 31:51.640
 is taking place.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.640
 They basically contradict each other.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.640
 But there's another reason why the revolution wasn't complete,

31:57.640 --> 31:59.640
 which is we don't understand the relationship

31:59.640 --> 32:01.640
 between these two parts.

32:01.640 --> 32:04.640
 The general relativity, which became our best theory

32:04.640 --> 32:07.640
 of space and time and gravitation and cosmology

32:07.640 --> 32:10.640
 and quantum theory.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.640
 So for the most part,

32:12.640 --> 32:15.640
 general relativity describes big things.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.640
 Quantum theory describes little things.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.640
 And that's the revolution that we found.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.640
 Really powerful tools to describe big things and little things.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.640
 And it's unfinished because

32:26.640 --> 32:28.640
 we have two totally separate things.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.640
 We need to figure out how to connect them so we can describe everything.

32:31.640 --> 32:34.640
 Right. And we either do that

32:34.640 --> 32:37.640
 if we believe quantum mechanics, as understood now,

32:37.640 --> 32:41.640
 is correct by bringing general relativity

32:41.640 --> 32:43.640
 or some extension of general relativity

32:43.640 --> 32:45.640
 that describes gravity and so forth

32:45.640 --> 32:49.640
 into the quantum domain that's called quantize.

32:49.640 --> 32:52.640
 The theory of gravity.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.640
 Or if you believe with Einstein

32:55.640 --> 32:57.640
 that quantum mechanics needs to be completed.

32:57.640 --> 33:00.640
 And this is my view.

33:00.640 --> 33:04.640
 Then part of the job of finding the right completion

33:04.640 --> 33:06.640
 or extension of quantum mechanics

33:06.640 --> 33:09.640
 would be one that incorporated space time and gravity.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.640
 So where do we begin?

33:14.640 --> 33:17.640
 So first, let me ask,

33:17.640 --> 33:19.640
 perhaps you can give me a chance

33:19.640 --> 33:21.640
 if I could ask you some just really basic questions.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.640
 Well, they're not at all.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.640
 The basic questions are the hardest,

33:25.640 --> 33:27.640
 you mentioned space time.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.640
 What is space time?

33:29.640 --> 33:31.640
 Space time, you talked about a construction.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.640
 So I believe the space time

33:33.640 --> 33:35.640
 is an intellectual construction

33:35.640 --> 33:38.640
 that we make of the events in the universe.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.640
 I believe the events are real

33:40.640 --> 33:43.640
 and the relationships between the events

33:43.640 --> 33:45.640
 which cause which are real.

33:45.640 --> 33:49.640
 But the idea that there's a four dimensional

33:49.640 --> 33:52.640
 smooth geometry which has a metric

33:52.640 --> 33:55.640
 and a connection and satisfies

33:55.640 --> 33:57.640
 the equations that Einstein wrote.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.640
 It's a good description to some scale.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.640
 It's a good approximation.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.640
 It captures some of what's really going on in nature.

34:04.640 --> 34:08.640
 But I don't believe it for a minute is fundamental.

34:08.640 --> 34:12.640
 So okay, we're going to allow me to link around that.

34:12.640 --> 34:14.640
 So the universe has events.

34:14.640 --> 34:16.640
 Events cause other events.

34:16.640 --> 34:18.640
 This is the idea of causality.

34:18.640 --> 34:21.640
 Okay, so that's real.

34:21.640 --> 34:23.640
 That's in my...

34:23.640 --> 34:25.640
 In your view, Israel.

34:25.640 --> 34:27.640
 Or hypothesis or the theories

34:27.640 --> 34:29.640
 that I have been working to develop

34:29.640 --> 34:31.640
 make that assumption.

34:31.640 --> 34:34.640
 So space time, you said four dimensional space

34:34.640 --> 34:36.640
 is kind of the location of things

34:36.640 --> 34:41.640
 and time is whatever the heck time is.

34:41.640 --> 34:46.640
 And you're saying that space time

34:46.640 --> 34:49.640
 is both space and time are emergent

34:49.640 --> 34:51.640
 and not fundamental.

34:51.640 --> 34:54.640
 Before you correct me,

34:54.640 --> 34:57.640
 what does it mean to be fundamental or emergent?

34:57.640 --> 35:00.640
 Fundamental means it's part of the description

35:00.640 --> 35:02.640
 as far down as you go.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.640
 We have this notion.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.640
 As real as real it could be.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.640
 So I think the time is fundamental

35:09.640 --> 35:11.640
 and quote goes all the way down

35:11.640 --> 35:13.640
 and space does not.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.640
 And the combination of them

35:15.640 --> 35:18.640
 we use in general relativity that we call space time

35:18.640 --> 35:20.640
 also does not.

35:20.640 --> 35:23.640
 But what is time then?

35:23.640 --> 35:26.640
 I think that time,

35:26.640 --> 35:28.640
 the activity of time

35:28.640 --> 35:31.640
 is the continual creation of events

35:31.640 --> 35:34.640
 from existing events.

35:34.640 --> 35:37.640
 So if there's no events, there's no time.

35:37.640 --> 35:40.640
 Then there's not only no time, there's no nothing.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.640
 So I believe the universe

35:43.640 --> 35:46.640
 has a history

35:46.640 --> 35:48.640
 which goes to the past.

35:48.640 --> 35:51.640
 I believe the future does not exist.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.640
 There's a notion of a present and a notion of the past.

35:54.640 --> 35:58.640
 And the past consists of

35:58.640 --> 36:01.640
 is a story about events that took place

36:01.640 --> 36:03.640
 to our past.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.640
 So you said the future doesn't exist.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.640
 Yes.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.640
 Could you say that again?

36:09.640 --> 36:11.640
 Can you try to

36:11.640 --> 36:14.640
 give me a chance to understand that one more time?

36:14.640 --> 36:17.640
 So the events cause other events.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.640
 What is this universe?

36:19.640 --> 36:21.640
 Because we'll talk about locality

36:21.640 --> 36:23.640
 and nonlocality.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.640
 Good.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.640
 Because it's a crazy, I mean it's not crazy,

36:27.640 --> 36:29.640
 it's a beautiful set of ideas

36:29.640 --> 36:31.640
 that you propose.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.640
 And if causality is fundamental

36:34.640 --> 36:36.640
 I'd just like to understand it better.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.640
 What is the past?

36:38.640 --> 36:40.640
 What is the future?

36:40.640 --> 36:42.640
 What is the flow of time?

36:42.640 --> 36:44.640
 Even the error of time

36:44.640 --> 36:47.640
 in our universe, in your view.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.640
 And maybe what's an event?

36:49.640 --> 36:52.640
 Oh, an event is where

36:52.640 --> 36:54.640
 something changes.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.640
 Or where

36:56.640 --> 36:58.640
 to...

36:58.640 --> 37:00.640
 It's hard to say

37:00.640 --> 37:02.640
 because it's a primitive concept.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.640
 An event is

37:04.640 --> 37:06.640
 a moment of time

37:06.640 --> 37:08.640
 within space.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.640
 This is the view in general relativity

37:11.640 --> 37:13.640
 where two particles intersect

37:13.640 --> 37:15.640
 in their paths

37:15.640 --> 37:17.640
 or something changes

37:17.640 --> 37:19.640
 in the path of a particle.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.640
 Now, we are

37:21.640 --> 37:23.640
 postulating that there is

37:23.640 --> 37:25.640
 at the fundamental level a notion

37:25.640 --> 37:27.640
 which is an elementary notion

37:27.640 --> 37:29.640
 so it doesn't have

37:29.640 --> 37:31.640
 a definition in terms of other things

37:31.640 --> 37:33.640
 but it is something elementary

37:33.640 --> 37:35.640
 happening.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.640
 And it doesn't have a connection to energy

37:37.640 --> 37:39.640
 or matter or exchange of energy?

37:39.640 --> 37:41.640
 Because it's at that level.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.640
 Yes, it involves

37:43.640 --> 37:45.640
 and that's why the version of

37:45.640 --> 37:47.640
 a theory of

37:47.640 --> 37:49.640
 events that I've developed

37:49.640 --> 37:51.640
 with Marina Cortez.

37:51.640 --> 37:53.640
 And by the way, I want to mention

37:53.640 --> 37:55.640
 my collaborators because they've been

37:55.640 --> 37:57.640
 at least as important in this work as I have.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.640
 There's Marina Cortez

37:59.640 --> 38:01.640
 in all the work since about

38:01.640 --> 38:03.640
 2013, 2012,

38:03.640 --> 38:05.640
 2013 about

38:05.640 --> 38:07.640
 causality, causal sets

38:07.640 --> 38:09.640
 in the period before that, Roberta

38:09.640 --> 38:11.640
 Mangibara Anga

38:11.640 --> 38:13.640
 who is a philosopher and a professor

38:13.640 --> 38:15.640
 of law.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.640
 And that's in your efforts together

38:17.640 --> 38:19.640
 with your collaborators to finish the unfinished revolution

38:19.640 --> 38:21.640
 and focus on causality

38:21.640 --> 38:23.640
 as a fundamental

38:23.640 --> 38:25.640
 as fundamental to physics.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.640
 So

38:27.640 --> 38:29.640
 And there's certainly other people

38:29.640 --> 38:31.640
 we've worked with but those two people's

38:31.640 --> 38:33.640
 thinking had a huge influence

38:33.640 --> 38:35.640
 on my own thinking.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.640
 That's why you describe causality.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.640
 That's what you mean of time being fundamental.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.640
 That causality is fundamental.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.640
 Yes.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.640
 And what does it mean for space

38:45.640 --> 38:47.640
 to not be fundamental?

38:47.640 --> 38:49.640
 That's very good.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.640
 There's a level of description

38:51.640 --> 38:53.640
 in which there are events

38:53.640 --> 38:55.640
 there are

38:55.640 --> 38:57.640
 events create other events

38:57.640 --> 38:59.640
 but there's no space.

38:59.640 --> 39:01.640
 They don't live in space.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.640
 They have an order in which they caused each other

39:03.640 --> 39:05.640
 and that is part

39:05.640 --> 39:07.640
 of the nature of time for us.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.640
 So

39:09.640 --> 39:11.640
 But there is an emergent

39:11.640 --> 39:13.640
 approximate description

39:13.640 --> 39:15.640
 and you asked me to find an emergent.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.640
 I didn't.

39:17.640 --> 39:19.640
 An emergent

39:19.640 --> 39:21.640
 property is a property

39:21.640 --> 39:23.640
 that arises

39:23.640 --> 39:25.640
 at some level of complexity

39:25.640 --> 39:27.640
 larger than

39:27.640 --> 39:29.640
 and more complex than the fundamental level

39:29.640 --> 39:31.640
 which requires

39:31.640 --> 39:33.640
 some property

39:33.640 --> 39:35.640
 to describe it

39:35.640 --> 39:37.640
 which is not directly

39:39.640 --> 39:41.640
 explicable

39:41.640 --> 39:43.640
 or derivable is the word I want

39:43.640 --> 39:45.640
 from the properties of the fundamental

39:45.640 --> 39:47.640
 things.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.640
 And space is one of those things

39:49.640 --> 39:51.640
 in a sufficiently complex

39:51.640 --> 39:53.640
 universe space

39:53.640 --> 39:55.640
 three dimensional

39:55.640 --> 39:57.640
 position of things emerged.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.640
 Yes and we have this

39:59.640 --> 40:01.640
 we saw how this happens

40:01.640 --> 40:03.640
 in detail in some models

40:03.640 --> 40:05.640
 both computationally

40:05.640 --> 40:07.640
 and analytically.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.640
 Okay so connected to space

40:09.640 --> 40:11.640
 is the idea of locality.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.640
 Yes.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.640
 So we talked about realism.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.640
 So I

40:17.640 --> 40:19.640
 live in this world that like sports

40:21.640 --> 40:23.640
 locality is a thing that

40:23.640 --> 40:25.640
 you can affect things close to you

40:25.640 --> 40:27.640
 and don't have an effect

40:27.640 --> 40:29.640
 on things that are far away.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.640
 It's a thing that bothers me about gravity

40:31.640 --> 40:33.640
 in general or action

40:33.640 --> 40:35.640
 at a distance.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.640
 Same thing that probably bothered Newton

40:37.640 --> 40:39.640
 or at least he said a little bit

40:39.640 --> 40:41.640
 about it.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.640
 Okay so what do you think about locality

40:45.640 --> 40:47.640
 is it just a construct

40:47.640 --> 40:49.640
 is it us humans

40:49.640 --> 40:51.640
 just like this idea

40:51.640 --> 40:53.640
 and are connected to it because we exist

40:53.640 --> 40:55.640
 and we need it for our survival

40:55.640 --> 40:57.640
 but it's not fundamental.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.640
 I mean it seems crazy for it not to be a fundamental

40:59.640 --> 41:01.640
 aspect of our reality.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.640
 It does.

41:03.640 --> 41:05.640
 Can you comfort me on a sort of as a therapist

41:05.640 --> 41:07.640
 like how do I

41:07.640 --> 41:09.640
 I'm not a good therapist.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.640
 I'll do my best.

41:13.640 --> 41:15.640
 There are several different definitions

41:15.640 --> 41:17.640
 of locality when you come

41:17.640 --> 41:19.640
 to talk about locality in physics

41:19.640 --> 41:21.640
 in

41:21.640 --> 41:23.640
 quantum field theory

41:23.640 --> 41:25.640
 which is a mixture

41:25.640 --> 41:27.640
 of special relativity

41:27.640 --> 41:29.640
 and quantum mechanics.

41:29.640 --> 41:31.640
 There is a precise definition

41:31.640 --> 41:33.640
 of locality.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.640
 Field operators

41:35.640 --> 41:37.640
 corresponding to events in space time

41:37.640 --> 41:39.640
 which are space like separated

41:39.640 --> 41:41.640
 commute with each other as operators.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.640
 So in quantum mechanics

41:43.640 --> 41:45.640
 you think about the nature realities

41:45.640 --> 41:47.640
 fields and things that are close

41:47.640 --> 41:49.640
 in a field have an impact

41:49.640 --> 41:51.640
 on each other more

41:51.640 --> 41:53.640
 than farther away.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.640
 That's very comforting.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.640
 That makes sense.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.640
 So that's a property of quantum field theory

41:59.640 --> 42:01.640
 and it's well tested.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.640
 Unfortunately there's another definition

42:03.640 --> 42:05.640
 of local

42:05.640 --> 42:07.640
 which was expressed by Einstein

42:07.640 --> 42:09.640
 and expressed more precisely

42:09.640 --> 42:11.640
 by John Bell

42:11.640 --> 42:13.640
 which has been tested experimentally

42:13.640 --> 42:15.640
 and found to fail.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.640
 And this setup

42:17.640 --> 42:19.640
 is you take two particles

42:19.640 --> 42:21.640
 so one thing

42:21.640 --> 42:23.640
 that's really weird about quantum mechanics

42:23.640 --> 42:25.640
 is a property called entanglement.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.640
 You can have two particles

42:27.640 --> 42:29.640
 interact and then share

42:29.640 --> 42:31.640
 a property

42:31.640 --> 42:33.640
 without being a property of either one

42:33.640 --> 42:35.640
 of the two particles.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.640
 And if you take such a system

42:37.640 --> 42:39.640
 and then

42:39.640 --> 42:41.640
 you make a measurement

42:41.640 --> 42:43.640
 on particle A

42:43.640 --> 42:45.640
 which is over here on my right side

42:45.640 --> 42:47.640
 and particle B

42:47.640 --> 42:49.640
 and somebody else makes a measurement

42:49.640 --> 42:51.640
 on particle B

42:51.640 --> 42:53.640
 you can ask

42:53.640 --> 42:55.640
 that whatever is

42:55.640 --> 42:57.640
 the real reality of particle B

42:57.640 --> 42:59.640
 it not be affected

42:59.640 --> 43:01.640
 by the choice

43:01.640 --> 43:03.640
 the observer at particle A

43:03.640 --> 43:05.640
 makes about what to measure. Not the outcome

43:05.640 --> 43:07.640
 just the choice of the different

43:07.640 --> 43:09.640
 things they might measure.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.640
 And that's a notion of locality

43:11.640 --> 43:13.640
 because it assumes that these things

43:13.640 --> 43:15.640
 are very far spaced like separated

43:15.640 --> 43:17.640
 and it's going to take a while

43:17.640 --> 43:19.640
 for any information

43:19.640 --> 43:21.640
 about the choice made by the people here at A

43:21.640 --> 43:23.640
 to affect the reality at B

43:23.640 --> 43:25.640
 but you make that assumption

43:25.640 --> 43:27.640
 that's called bell locality

43:27.640 --> 43:29.640
 and you derive a certain inequality

43:29.640 --> 43:31.640
 that some

43:31.640 --> 43:33.640
 correlations, functions of correlations

43:33.640 --> 43:35.640
 have to satisfy.

43:35.640 --> 43:37.640
 And then you can test that

43:37.640 --> 43:39.640
 pretty directly

43:39.640 --> 43:41.640
 in experiments which create pairs

43:41.640 --> 43:43.640
 of photons or other particles

43:43.640 --> 43:45.640
 and it's wrong by many

43:45.640 --> 43:47.640
 sigma.

43:47.640 --> 43:49.640
 In experiment it doesn't match.

43:49.640 --> 43:51.640
 What does that mean?

43:51.640 --> 43:53.640
 That means that that definition

43:53.640 --> 43:55.640
 of locality I stated is false.

43:55.640 --> 43:57.640
 The one that Einstein

43:57.640 --> 43:59.640
 was playing with?

43:59.640 --> 44:01.640
 The one that I stated that is

44:01.640 --> 44:03.640
 it's not true that

44:03.640 --> 44:05.640
 whatever is real about particle B

44:05.640 --> 44:07.640
 is unaffected

44:07.640 --> 44:09.640
 by the choice that the observer makes

44:09.640 --> 44:11.640
 as to what to measure in particle A.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.640
 No matter how long they've been

44:13.640 --> 44:15.640
 propagating at almost the speed of light

44:15.640 --> 44:17.640
 or the speed of light

44:17.640 --> 44:19.640
 away from each other.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.640
 No matter, so like the distance between them?

44:21.640 --> 44:23.640
 Well, it's been tested of course

44:23.640 --> 44:25.640
 if you want to have hope

44:25.640 --> 44:27.640
 for quantum mechanics

44:27.640 --> 44:29.640
 being incomplete or wrong

44:29.640 --> 44:31.640
 and corrected by something that changes this.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.640
 It's been tested over

44:33.640 --> 44:35.640
 a number of kilometers.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.640
 I don't remember

44:37.640 --> 44:39.640
 whether it's 25 kilometers

44:39.640 --> 44:41.640
 or 170 kilometers.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.640
 So

44:43.640 --> 44:45.640
 in trying to solve the

44:45.640 --> 44:47.640
 unsolved revolution

44:47.640 --> 44:49.640
 in trying to come up with the theory of everything

44:49.640 --> 44:51.640
 is

44:51.640 --> 44:53.640
 causality, fundamental

44:53.640 --> 44:55.640
 and

44:55.640 --> 44:57.640
 breaking away from locality?

44:57.640 --> 44:59.640
 Absolutely.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.640
 A crucial step.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.640
 In your book essentially those are the

45:03.640 --> 45:05.640
 two things we really need to

45:05.640 --> 45:07.640
 think about as a community.

45:07.640 --> 45:09.640
 Especially the physics community has to think about

45:09.640 --> 45:11.640
 this.

45:11.640 --> 45:13.640
 I guess my question is

45:13.640 --> 45:15.640
 how do we solve

45:15.640 --> 45:17.640
 how do we finish the unfinished

45:17.640 --> 45:19.640
 revolution?

45:19.640 --> 45:21.640
 Well, that's...

45:21.640 --> 45:23.640
 I can only tell you what I'm trying to do

45:23.640 --> 45:25.640
 and what I've abandoned

45:25.640 --> 45:27.640
 as not working.

45:27.640 --> 45:29.640
 As one ant, smart ant

45:29.640 --> 45:31.640
 and an ant colony?

45:31.640 --> 45:33.640
 Yep.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.640
 Or maybe dumb, that's why.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.640
 But anyway,

45:37.640 --> 45:39.640
 my view of the

45:39.640 --> 45:41.640
 we've had some nice

45:41.640 --> 45:43.640
 theories invented.

45:43.640 --> 45:45.640
 There's a bunch

45:45.640 --> 45:47.640
 of different ones.

45:47.640 --> 45:49.640
 Both relate to quantum mechanics

45:49.640 --> 45:51.640
 relate to quantum gravity.

45:51.640 --> 45:53.640
 There's a lot to admire

45:53.640 --> 45:55.640
 in many of these different approaches.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.640
 But to my

45:57.640 --> 45:59.640
 understanding they

45:59.640 --> 46:01.640
 none of them completely

46:01.640 --> 46:03.640
 solve the problems that I care about.

46:03.640 --> 46:05.640
 And

46:05.640 --> 46:07.640
 so we're in a situation

46:07.640 --> 46:09.640
 which

46:09.640 --> 46:11.640
 is either terrifying for a student

46:11.640 --> 46:13.640
 or full of opportunity for the right

46:13.640 --> 46:15.640
 student in which we've got

46:15.640 --> 46:17.640
 more than a dozen

46:17.640 --> 46:19.640
 attempts.

46:19.640 --> 46:21.640
 And I never thought, I don't think anybody

46:21.640 --> 46:23.640
 anticipated would work out this way.

46:23.640 --> 46:25.640
 Which work partly and then at some point

46:25.640 --> 46:27.640
 they have an issue

46:27.640 --> 46:29.640
 that nobody can figure out how to go around

46:29.640 --> 46:31.640
 or how to solve.

46:31.640 --> 46:33.640
 And

46:33.640 --> 46:35.640
 that's the situation we're in.

46:35.640 --> 46:37.640
 My reaction to that

46:37.640 --> 46:39.640
 is two folks.

46:39.640 --> 46:41.640
 One of them is to try to

46:41.640 --> 46:43.640
 bring people, we evolved

46:43.640 --> 46:45.640
 into this unfortunate

46:45.640 --> 46:47.640
 sociological situation in which there are

46:47.640 --> 46:49.640
 communities around some

46:49.640 --> 46:51.640
 of these approaches. And to borrow

46:51.640 --> 46:53.640
 again a metaphor from Eric

46:53.640 --> 46:55.640
 they sit on top of hills

46:55.640 --> 46:57.640
 in the landscape of theories

46:57.640 --> 46:59.640
 and throw rocks at each other.

46:59.640 --> 47:01.640
 And as Eric says

47:01.640 --> 47:03.640
 we need two things. We need people

47:03.640 --> 47:05.640
 to get off their hills

47:05.640 --> 47:07.640
 and come down into the valleys

47:07.640 --> 47:09.640
 and party and talk

47:09.640 --> 47:11.640
 and become friendly and

47:11.640 --> 47:13.640
 learn to say

47:13.640 --> 47:15.640
 not no but

47:15.640 --> 47:17.640
 but yes and

47:17.640 --> 47:19.640
 yes, your idea goes this far

47:19.640 --> 47:21.640
 but maybe if we put it together with my idea

47:21.640 --> 47:23.640
 we can go further.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.640
 Yes.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.640
 So in that spirit

47:27.640 --> 47:29.640
 I've talked

47:29.640 --> 47:31.640
 several times with Sean Carroll

47:31.640 --> 47:33.640
 who's also written

47:33.640 --> 47:35.640
 an excellent book recently

47:35.640 --> 47:37.640
 and he plays around

47:37.640 --> 47:39.640
 as a big fan of the many worlds interpretation

47:39.640 --> 47:41.640
 of quantum mechanics.

47:41.640 --> 47:43.640
 So I'm a troublemaker

47:43.640 --> 47:45.640
 so let me ask

47:45.640 --> 47:47.640
 what's your sense of

47:47.640 --> 47:49.640
 Sean and the idea of many worlds interpretation?

47:49.640 --> 47:51.640
 I've read many

47:51.640 --> 47:53.640
 the commentary back and forth

47:53.640 --> 47:55.640
 you guys are friendly

47:55.640 --> 47:57.640
 but have a lot of fun debating.

47:57.640 --> 47:59.640
 I love Sean and

47:59.640 --> 48:01.640
 he, no, I really

48:01.640 --> 48:03.640
 he's

48:03.640 --> 48:05.640
 not, he's articulate

48:05.640 --> 48:07.640
 and he's a great representative

48:07.640 --> 48:09.640
 or ambassador of science

48:09.640 --> 48:11.640
 to the public

48:11.640 --> 48:13.640
 for different fields of science to each other.

48:13.640 --> 48:15.640
 He also

48:15.640 --> 48:17.640
 like I do takes philosophy

48:17.640 --> 48:19.640
 seriously

48:19.640 --> 48:21.640
 and

48:21.640 --> 48:23.640
 unlike what I do

48:23.640 --> 48:25.640
 in all cases he's really done the homework.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.640
 He's read a lot

48:27.640 --> 48:29.640
 he knows the people

48:29.640 --> 48:31.640
 he talks to them

48:31.640 --> 48:33.640
 he exposes his arguments to them

48:33.640 --> 48:35.640
 and I

48:35.640 --> 48:37.640
 there's this mysterious thing

48:37.640 --> 48:39.640
 that we so often end up

48:39.640 --> 48:41.640
 on the opposite sides of these issues.

48:41.640 --> 48:43.640
 It's fun though.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.640
 It's fun and

48:45.640 --> 48:47.640
 I'd love to have a conversation

48:47.640 --> 48:49.640
 about that but I would want to include him.

48:49.640 --> 48:51.640
 I see about many worlds

48:51.640 --> 48:53.640
 No, I can tell you what I think about many worlds.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.640
 I'd love to but actually on that let me pause

48:55.640 --> 48:57.640
 Sean has a podcast

48:57.640 --> 48:59.640
 you should definitely figure out how to talk to Sean.

48:59.640 --> 49:01.640
 I actually told Sean

49:01.640 --> 49:03.640
 I would love to hear you guys just going back and forth

49:03.640 --> 49:05.640
 so

49:05.640 --> 49:07.640
 I hope you can make that happen eventually

49:07.640 --> 49:09.640
 you and Sean. I want to tell you what it is

49:09.640 --> 49:11.640
 but there's something that Sean said to me

49:11.640 --> 49:13.640
 in June of 2016

49:13.640 --> 49:15.640
 that changed

49:15.640 --> 49:17.640
 my whole approach to a problem

49:17.640 --> 49:19.640
 but I have to tell him first.

49:19.640 --> 49:21.640
 That will be great

49:21.640 --> 49:23.640
 to tell him on his podcast.

49:23.640 --> 49:25.640
 I can't invite myself to his podcast

49:25.640 --> 49:27.640
 I told him.

49:27.640 --> 49:29.640
 We'll make it happen.

49:29.640 --> 49:31.640
 So many worlds.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.640
 What's your view?

49:33.640 --> 49:35.640
 We talked about non locality.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.640
 Many worlds is also a very

49:37.640 --> 49:39.640
 uncomfortable idea

49:39.640 --> 49:41.640
 or beautiful depending

49:41.640 --> 49:43.640
 on your perspective.

49:43.640 --> 49:45.640
 It's

49:45.640 --> 49:47.640
 very nice

49:47.640 --> 49:49.640
 because

49:49.640 --> 49:51.640
 there's a realist aspect to it

49:51.640 --> 49:53.640
 I think you called it magical realist

49:53.640 --> 49:55.640
 it's just a beautiful line

49:55.640 --> 49:57.640
 but

49:57.640 --> 49:59.640
 at the same time it's very difficult to

49:59.640 --> 50:01.640
 far limit a human mind to comprehend

50:01.640 --> 50:03.640
 so what are your thoughts about it?

50:05.640 --> 50:07.640
 Let me start

50:07.640 --> 50:09.640
 with the easy and obvious

50:09.640 --> 50:11.640
 and then go to the scientific

50:11.640 --> 50:13.640
 it doesn't appeal to me

50:13.640 --> 50:15.640
 it doesn't answer the questions

50:15.640 --> 50:17.640
 I want answered

50:17.640 --> 50:19.640
 and it does so to such a

50:19.640 --> 50:21.640
 strong case that when Roberto

50:21.640 --> 50:23.640
 Mangibar Anger and I

50:23.640 --> 50:25.640
 began looking for principles

50:25.640 --> 50:27.640
 and I want to come back and talk about the use of principles

50:27.640 --> 50:29.640
 in science because that's the other thing

50:29.640 --> 50:31.640
 I was going to say and I don't want to lose that

50:31.640 --> 50:33.640
 when we started looking for principles

50:33.640 --> 50:35.640
 we made our first principle

50:35.640 --> 50:37.640
 there is just one world

50:37.640 --> 50:39.640
 and it happens once

50:39.640 --> 50:41.640
 but

50:41.640 --> 50:43.640
 it's

50:43.640 --> 50:45.640
 not helpful to my

50:45.640 --> 50:47.640
 personal approach to my personal

50:47.640 --> 50:49.640
 agenda but of course

50:49.640 --> 50:51.640
 I'm part of a community

50:51.640 --> 50:53.640
 and

50:53.640 --> 50:55.640
 my sense of

50:55.640 --> 50:57.640
 the many worlds interpretation I have

50:57.640 --> 50:59.640
 thought a lot about it and struggled a lot

50:59.640 --> 51:01.640
 with it is

51:01.640 --> 51:03.640
 the following

51:05.640 --> 51:07.640
 first of all there's Everett himself

51:07.640 --> 51:09.640
 there's what's in Everett

51:09.640 --> 51:11.640
 and there are several

51:11.640 --> 51:13.640
 issues there

51:13.640 --> 51:15.640
 connected with the

51:15.640 --> 51:17.640
 derivation of the born rule

51:17.640 --> 51:19.640
 which is the rule that gives probabilities

51:19.640 --> 51:21.640
 to events

51:21.640 --> 51:23.640
 and the reasons why there is a

51:23.640 --> 51:25.640
 problem with probability

51:25.640 --> 51:27.640
 is that

51:27.640 --> 51:29.640
 I mentioned the two ways that

51:29.640 --> 51:31.640
 physical systems can evolve

51:31.640 --> 51:33.640
 the many worlds interpretation

51:33.640 --> 51:35.640
 cuts off one the one having

51:35.640 --> 51:37.640
 to do with measurement

51:37.640 --> 51:39.640
 and just has the other one the Schrodinger evolution

51:39.640 --> 51:41.640
 which is the smooth evolution

51:41.640 --> 51:43.640
 of the quantum state

51:43.640 --> 51:45.640
 but the notion of probability

51:45.640 --> 51:47.640
 is only in

51:47.640 --> 51:49.640
 the second rule which we've thrown away

51:49.640 --> 51:51.640
 so where does

51:51.640 --> 51:53.640
 probability come from and you have to answer the

51:53.640 --> 51:55.640
 question because

51:55.640 --> 51:57.640
 experimentalists use probabilities

51:57.640 --> 51:59.640
 to check the theory

51:59.640 --> 52:01.640
 now

52:01.640 --> 52:03.640
 at first

52:03.640 --> 52:05.640
 side you get very confused because there seems

52:05.640 --> 52:07.640
 to be a real problem

52:07.640 --> 52:09.640
 because in the many worlds interpretation

52:09.640 --> 52:11.640
 this talk about

52:11.640 --> 52:13.640
 branches is not quite precise but I'll

52:13.640 --> 52:15.640
 use it

52:15.640 --> 52:17.640
 there's a branch in which

52:17.640 --> 52:19.640
 everything that might happen does

52:19.640 --> 52:21.640
 happen with probability one

52:21.640 --> 52:23.640
 in that branch

52:23.640 --> 52:25.640
 you might think you could count the

52:25.640 --> 52:27.640
 number of branches

52:27.640 --> 52:29.640
 in which things do and don't happen

52:29.640 --> 52:31.640
 and get numbers that

52:31.640 --> 52:33.640
 you can define as something like

52:33.640 --> 52:35.640
 frequentist probabilities

52:35.640 --> 52:37.640
 and

52:37.640 --> 52:39.640
 ever did have an argument in that direction

52:39.640 --> 52:41.640
 but

52:41.640 --> 52:43.640
 the argument gets very subtle when

52:43.640 --> 52:45.640
 there are an infinite number of possibilities

52:45.640 --> 52:47.640
 as is the case in most quantum

52:47.640 --> 52:49.640
 systems and my

52:49.640 --> 52:51.640
 understanding although

52:51.640 --> 52:53.640
 I'm not as much of an expert as some other

52:53.640 --> 52:55.640
 people is that ever

52:55.640 --> 52:57.640
 its own proposal

52:57.640 --> 52:59.640
 failed did not work

52:59.640 --> 53:01.640
 there are then

53:01.640 --> 53:03.640
 if it doesn't stop there

53:03.640 --> 53:05.640
 there is

53:05.640 --> 53:07.640
 an important idea that ever

53:07.640 --> 53:09.640
 didn't know about which is decoherence

53:09.640 --> 53:11.640
 and it is a phenomenon that

53:11.640 --> 53:13.640
 might be very much relevant

53:13.640 --> 53:15.640
 and so

53:15.640 --> 53:17.640
 a number of people

53:17.640 --> 53:19.640
 post everett have

53:19.640 --> 53:21.640
 tried to make versions of what you

53:21.640 --> 53:23.640
 might call many worlds quantum mechanics

53:25.640 --> 53:27.640
 and this

53:27.640 --> 53:29.640
 is a big area and it's subtle

53:29.640 --> 53:31.640
 and it's not the kind of thing that

53:31.640 --> 53:33.640
 I do well

53:33.640 --> 53:35.640
 that's why there's two chapters

53:35.640 --> 53:37.640
 on this in the book I wrote

53:37.640 --> 53:39.640
 chapter 10 which is about everett's version

53:39.640 --> 53:41.640
 chapter 11

53:41.640 --> 53:43.640
 there's a very good group

53:43.640 --> 53:45.640
 of philosophers of physics in oxford

53:45.640 --> 53:47.640
 simon saunders

53:47.640 --> 53:49.640
 david walis

53:49.640 --> 53:51.640
 harvey brown

53:51.640 --> 53:53.640
 and a number of others and of course

53:53.640 --> 53:55.640
 there's david deutch

53:55.640 --> 53:57.640
 who is there

53:57.640 --> 53:59.640
 and those people have developed

53:59.640 --> 54:01.640
 and put a lot of work

54:01.640 --> 54:03.640
 into a very sophisticated

54:03.640 --> 54:05.640
 set of ideas designed to come back

54:05.640 --> 54:07.640
 and answer that question

54:07.640 --> 54:09.640
 they have the flavor of

54:09.640 --> 54:11.640
 there are really no probabilities

54:11.640 --> 54:13.640
 we admit that but imagine

54:13.640 --> 54:15.640
 if the everett story was true

54:15.640 --> 54:17.640
 and you were living in that

54:17.640 --> 54:19.640
 multiverse how would you make

54:19.640 --> 54:21.640
 bets and so

54:21.640 --> 54:23.640
 they use

54:23.640 --> 54:25.640
 decision theory from the theory

54:25.640 --> 54:27.640
 of probability and gambling and so forth

54:27.640 --> 54:29.640
 to shape a story

54:29.640 --> 54:31.640
 of how

54:31.640 --> 54:33.640
 you would bet if you were

54:33.640 --> 54:35.640
 inside an everett in the universe

54:35.640 --> 54:37.640
 and you knew that

54:37.640 --> 54:39.640
 and there's a debate

54:39.640 --> 54:41.640
 among those experts

54:41.640 --> 54:43.640
 as to whether

54:43.640 --> 54:45.640
 they or somebody else has really

54:45.640 --> 54:47.640
 succeeded

54:47.640 --> 54:49.640
 and when I checked in

54:49.640 --> 54:51.640
 as I was finishing the book with some of those

54:51.640 --> 54:53.640
 people like simon who's a good friend

54:53.640 --> 54:55.640
 of mine

54:55.640 --> 54:57.640
 they told me

54:57.640 --> 54:59.640
 that they weren't sure that any of them

54:59.640 --> 55:01.640
 was yet correct

55:01.640 --> 55:03.640
 so that's what I put in my book

55:03.640 --> 55:05.640
 now to add to that

55:05.640 --> 55:07.640
 shawn has his own

55:07.640 --> 55:09.640
 approach to that problem in what's called

55:09.640 --> 55:11.640
 self referencing or self locating

55:11.640 --> 55:13.640
 observers

55:13.640 --> 55:15.640
 and

55:15.640 --> 55:17.640
 it doesn't

55:17.640 --> 55:19.640
 I tried to read it

55:19.640 --> 55:21.640
 and it didn't make sense to me

55:21.640 --> 55:23.640
 but I didn't study it hard

55:23.640 --> 55:25.640
 I didn't communicate with shawn

55:25.640 --> 55:27.640
 I didn't do the things that I would do

55:27.640 --> 55:29.640
 so I had nothing to say about in the book

55:29.640 --> 55:31.640
 I don't know

55:31.640 --> 55:33.640
 whether it's right or not

55:33.640 --> 55:35.640
 let's talk a little bit about

55:35.640 --> 55:37.640
 science you mentioned

55:37.640 --> 55:39.640
 the use of principles in science

55:39.640 --> 55:41.640
 what does it mean

55:41.640 --> 55:43.640
 to have a principle and

55:43.640 --> 55:45.640
 why is that important

55:45.640 --> 55:47.640
 when I feel very frustrated

55:47.640 --> 55:49.640
 about quantum gravity I like to go back

55:49.640 --> 55:51.640
 and read history

55:51.640 --> 55:53.640
 and of course

55:53.640 --> 55:55.640
 Einstein's achievements are

55:55.640 --> 55:57.640
 a huge lesson

55:57.640 --> 55:59.640
 and hopefully

55:59.640 --> 56:01.640
 something like a role model and it's very clear

56:01.640 --> 56:03.640
 that Einstein

56:03.640 --> 56:05.640
 thought that the first job

56:05.640 --> 56:07.640
 when you want to

56:07.640 --> 56:09.640
 enter a new domain of theoretical

56:09.640 --> 56:11.640
 physics is to discover and invent

56:11.640 --> 56:13.640
 principles

56:13.640 --> 56:15.640
 and then make models of how those

56:15.640 --> 56:17.640
 principles might be applied in some

56:17.640 --> 56:19.640
 experimental situation

56:19.640 --> 56:21.640
 where the mathematics comes in

56:21.640 --> 56:23.640
 so for Einstein

56:23.640 --> 56:25.640
 there was no

56:25.640 --> 56:27.640
 unified space and time

56:27.640 --> 56:29.640
 Minkowski invented this idea of

56:29.640 --> 56:31.640
 space time

56:31.640 --> 56:33.640
 for Einstein it was a model of his

56:33.640 --> 56:35.640
 principles or his postulates

56:35.640 --> 56:37.640
 and I've

56:37.640 --> 56:39.640
 taken the view

56:39.640 --> 56:41.640
 that we don't know

56:41.640 --> 56:43.640
 the principles of quantum gravity

56:43.640 --> 56:45.640
 I can think about

56:45.640 --> 56:47.640
 candidates and I have some papers where I

56:47.640 --> 56:49.640
 discuss different

56:49.640 --> 56:51.640
 candidates and I'm happy to discuss them

56:51.640 --> 56:53.640
 but my

56:53.640 --> 56:55.640
 belief now is that

56:55.640 --> 56:57.640
 those partially successful approaches

56:57.640 --> 56:59.640
 are all

56:59.640 --> 57:01.640
 models

57:01.640 --> 57:03.640
 which might describe

57:03.640 --> 57:05.640
 indeed some quantum gravity

57:05.640 --> 57:07.640
 physics in some domain in some

57:07.640 --> 57:09.640
 aspect but

57:09.640 --> 57:11.640
 ultimately

57:11.640 --> 57:13.640
 would be important because they

57:13.640 --> 57:15.640
 model the principles and

57:15.640 --> 57:17.640
 the first job is to tie down those

57:17.640 --> 57:19.640
 principles so that's the approach

57:19.640 --> 57:21.640
 that I'm taking

57:21.640 --> 57:23.640
 so speaking of principles

57:23.640 --> 57:25.640
 in your 2006 book

57:25.640 --> 57:27.640
 The Trouble with Physics

57:27.640 --> 57:29.640
 you

57:29.640 --> 57:31.640
 criticized a bit string theory

57:31.640 --> 57:33.640
 for taking us away from the

57:33.640 --> 57:35.640
 rigors of the scientific method

57:35.640 --> 57:37.640
 or whatever you would call it but

57:37.640 --> 57:39.640
 what's

57:39.640 --> 57:41.640
 the trouble with physics

57:41.640 --> 57:43.640
 today and how do we fix it

57:43.640 --> 57:45.640
 can I say

57:45.640 --> 57:47.640
 how I read that book

57:47.640 --> 57:49.640
 and I'm not

57:49.640 --> 57:51.640
 this of course has to be

57:51.640 --> 57:53.640
 my fault because

57:53.640 --> 57:55.640
 you can't as an author claim

57:55.640 --> 57:57.640
 after all the work you put in that you are

57:57.640 --> 57:59.640
 misread

57:59.640 --> 58:01.640
 but I will

58:01.640 --> 58:03.640
 say that many of the reviewers

58:03.640 --> 58:05.640
 who are not

58:05.640 --> 58:07.640
 personally involved and even many

58:07.640 --> 58:09.640
 who were working on string theory

58:09.640 --> 58:11.640
 some other approach to quantum gravity

58:11.640 --> 58:13.640
 told me, communicated with me

58:13.640 --> 58:15.640
 and told me they thought that I was

58:15.640 --> 58:17.640
 fair and

58:17.640 --> 58:19.640
 balance was the word

58:19.640 --> 58:21.640
 that was usually used so let me tell you

58:21.640 --> 58:23.640
 what my purpose was in writing that

58:23.640 --> 58:25.640
 book which clearly

58:25.640 --> 58:27.640
 got diverted by

58:27.640 --> 58:29.640
 because there was already

58:31.640 --> 58:33.640
 a rather hot argument

58:33.640 --> 58:35.640
 going on and this is

58:35.640 --> 58:37.640
 on which topic on string theory specifically

58:37.640 --> 58:39.640
 or in general in physics

58:39.640 --> 58:41.640
 no

58:41.640 --> 58:43.640
 more specifically than string theory

58:43.640 --> 58:45.640
 so

58:45.640 --> 58:47.640
 since we're in Cambridge can I say that

58:47.640 --> 58:49.640
 we're doing this in Cambridge

58:49.640 --> 58:51.640
 just to be clear, Massachusetts

58:51.640 --> 58:53.640
 and

58:53.640 --> 58:55.640
 on Harvard campus

58:55.640 --> 58:57.640
 right so

58:57.640 --> 58:59.640
 Andy Strominger

58:59.640 --> 59:01.640
 is a good friend of mine and has been

59:01.640 --> 59:03.640
 for many many years

59:03.640 --> 59:05.640
 and Andy

59:05.640 --> 59:07.640
 so originally

59:07.640 --> 59:09.640
 there was this beautiful idea

59:09.640 --> 59:11.640
 that there were five string theories

59:11.640 --> 59:13.640
 and maybe they would be unified into one

59:13.640 --> 59:15.640
 and we would discover

59:15.640 --> 59:17.640
 a way to break that

59:17.640 --> 59:19.640
 symmetries of one of those string

59:19.640 --> 59:21.640
 theories and discover the standard

59:21.640 --> 59:23.640
 model and predict

59:23.640 --> 59:25.640
 all the properties of standard model particles

59:25.640 --> 59:27.640
 like their masses and charges

59:27.640 --> 59:29.640
 and so forth, coupling constant

59:31.640 --> 59:33.640
 and then there was a bunch

59:33.640 --> 59:35.640
 of solutions

59:35.640 --> 59:37.640
 to string theory found which led

59:37.640 --> 59:39.640
 each of them to a different version

59:39.640 --> 59:41.640
 of particle physics with a different phenomenology

59:41.640 --> 59:43.640
 these are called

59:43.640 --> 59:45.640
 the Chalabi Yao

59:45.640 --> 59:47.640
 metaphors named after

59:47.640 --> 59:49.640
 Yao who was also here

59:49.640 --> 59:51.640
 not

59:51.640 --> 59:53.640
 certainly we've been friends at some time in the past

59:53.640 --> 59:55.640
 anyway

59:55.640 --> 59:57.640
 and then there were nobody was sure

59:57.640 --> 59:59.640
 but hundreds of thousands of different

59:59.640 --> 1:00:01.640
 versions of string theory

1:00:01.640 --> 1:00:03.640
 and then Andy

1:00:03.640 --> 1:00:05.640
 found there was a way to put a certain kind

1:00:05.640 --> 1:00:07.640
 of mathematical curvature called

1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:09.640
 torsion

1:00:09.640 --> 1:00:11.640
 into the solutions and he wrote a paper

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:13.640
 of string theory with torsion

1:00:13.640 --> 1:00:15.640
 in which he discovered there was

1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:19.640
 not formally

1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:21.640
 uncountable but he was unable to invent

1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:23.640
 any way to count

1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:25.640
 the number of solutions or classify

1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:27.640
 the diverse solutions

1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:29.640
 and he wrote that this is

1:00:29.640 --> 1:00:31.640
 worrying

1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:33.640
 doing phenomenology the old fashioned way

1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:35.640
 by solving the theory

1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:37.640
 is not going to work because

1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:39.640
 there's going to be

1:00:39.640 --> 1:00:41.640
 loads of solutions for editing

1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:43.640
 proposed phenomenology for anything

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:45.640
 of the experiments

1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:47.640
 it hasn't quite worked out that way

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:49.640
 but nonetheless he took

1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:51.640
 that worry to me

1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:53.640
 we spoke at least once

1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:55.640
 maybe two or three times about that

1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:57.640
 and I got seriously

1:00:57.640 --> 1:00:59.640
 worried about that

1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:01.640
 and this is a little

1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:03.640
 sounds like an anecdote that

1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:05.640
 inspired your worry

1:01:05.640 --> 1:01:07.640
 about string theory in general

1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:09.640
 well I tried to solve the problem

1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:11.640
 and I tried to solve the problem

1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:13.640
 I was reading

1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:15.640
 at that time a lot of biology

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:17.640
 a lot of evolutionary theory like

1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:19.640
 Lindmerg Gullis and

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:21.640
 Steve Gould and so

1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:23.640
 forth and

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:27.640
 I

1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:29.640
 could take your time to go through

1:01:29.640 --> 1:01:31.640
 things but it occurred to me maybe

1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:33.640
 physics was like evolutionary biology

1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:35.640
 and maybe the laws

1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:37.640
 evolved and there was

1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:39.640
 the biologists talk about a landscape

1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:41.640
 a fitness landscape

1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:43.640
 of

1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:45.640
 DNA sequences or protein

1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:47.640
 sequences or a species

1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:49.640
 or something like that

1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:51.640
 and I took their concept and the word

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:53.640
 landscape from theoretical biology

1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:55.640
 and made a scenario about how the

1:01:55.640 --> 1:01:57.640
 physics as a whole

1:01:57.640 --> 1:01:59.640
 could evolve

1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:01.640
 to discover the

1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:03.640
 parameters of the standard model

1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:05.640
 and I'm happy to discuss that's called

1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:07.640
 cosmological natural selection

1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:09.640
 cosmological natural selection

1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:11.640
 so the parameters

1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:13.640
 of the standard model so the laws

1:02:13.640 --> 1:02:15.640
 of physics are changing

1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:17.640
 this idea would say that

1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:19.640
 the laws of physics are changing

1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:21.640
 in some way

1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:23.640
 that echoes

1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:25.640
 that of natural selection or just

1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:27.640
 it adjusts in some way

1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:29.640
 towards some goal

1:02:29.640 --> 1:02:31.640
 yes and

1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:33.640
 I published that

1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:35.640
 I wrote the paper in

1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:37.640
 8 or 89 the paper was published

1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:39.640
 in 92

1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:41.640
 my first book in 1997 the life of the

1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:43.640
 cosmos was explicitly

1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:45.640
 about that

1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:47.640
 and I was very clear

1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:49.640
 that what was important

1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:51.640
 is that because

1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:53.640
 you would develop an ensemble

1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:55.640
 of universes but they were

1:02:55.640 --> 1:02:57.640
 related by descent

1:02:57.640 --> 1:02:59.640
 through natural selection

1:02:59.640 --> 1:03:01.640
 almost every

1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:03.640
 universe would share the property

1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:05.640
 that it was

1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:07.640
 its fitness was maximized

1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:09.640
 to some extent or at least close

1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:11.640
 to maximum and I could deduce

1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:13.640
 predictions that could be tested

1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:15.640
 from that

1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:17.640
 and I worked all

1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:19.640
 of that out and I compared it to the

1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:21.640
 happy principle where you weren't

1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:23.640
 able to make tests

1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:25.640
 or make falsifications all of this

1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:27.640
 was in the late 80s

1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:29.640
 and early 90s

1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:31.640
 that's a really compelling notion but

1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:33.640
 how does that help you arrive

1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:35.640
 I'm coming to where

1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:37.640
 the book came from

1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:39.640
 so

1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:41.640
 what got me

1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:43.640
 I worked on string theory

1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:45.640
 I also

1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:47.640
 worked on loop current gravity

1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:49.640
 and that was one of the inventors of loop current gravity

1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:51.640
 and because

1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:53.640
 of my

1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:55.640
 strong belief in some other principles

1:03:55.640 --> 1:03:57.640
 which led to this notion of wanting a quantum

1:03:57.640 --> 1:03:59.640
 theory of gravity to be what we call

1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:01.640
 relational or background

1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:03.640
 independent

1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:05.640
 I tried very hard to make

1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:07.640
 string theory background independent

1:04:07.640 --> 1:04:09.640
 and in an up developing a bunch of tools

1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:11.640
 which then could apply directly

1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:13.640
 to general relativity and that became loop current gravity

1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:15.640
 so the things were

1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:17.640
 very closely related and have always been

1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:19.640
 very closely related in my mind

1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:21.640
 the idea that there were two communities

1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:23.640
 one devoted to strings and one devoted

1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:25.640
 to loops is nuts and has always

1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:27.640
 been nuts

1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:29.640
 okay so

1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:31.640
 so anyway

1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:33.640
 there's this nuts community of loops and strings

1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:35.640
 that are all beautiful and compelling

1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:37.640
 and mathematically speaking

1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:39.640
 and what's the trouble with all that

1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:41.640
 why is that such a problem

1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:43.640
 so I was interested

1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:45.640
 in developing that notion of how science

1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:47.640
 works based on the community

1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:49.640
 and ethics that I told you about

1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:51.640
 and I wrote

1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:53.640
 a draft of a book about that

1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:55.640
 which had

1:04:55.640 --> 1:04:57.640
 several chapters on methodology

1:04:57.640 --> 1:04:59.640
 of science and it was

1:04:59.640 --> 1:05:01.640
 rather academically oriented

1:05:01.640 --> 1:05:03.640
 book and

1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:05.640
 those chapters were the first

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:07.640
 part of the book the first third of it

1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:09.640
 and you can find their remnants

1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:11.640
 in what's now the last

1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:13.640
 part of

1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:15.640
 the trouble with physics and then I described

1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:17.640
 a number of test cases

1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:19.640
 case studies and one of them

1:05:19.640 --> 1:05:21.640
 which I knew was the search for

1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:23.640
 quantum gravity and string theory and so forth

1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:25.640
 and

1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:27.640
 I was unable to get that

1:05:27.640 --> 1:05:29.640
 book published

1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:31.640
 so somebody made

1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:33.640
 the suggestion of flipping it around

1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:35.640
 and starting with

1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:37.640
 the story of string theory which was already

1:05:37.640 --> 1:05:39.640
 controversial this was

1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:41.640
 2004, 2005

1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:43.640
 but

1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:45.640
 I was very careful

1:05:45.640 --> 1:05:47.640
 to

1:05:47.640 --> 1:05:49.640
 be detailed to

1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:51.640
 criticize

1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:53.640
 papers and not people you won't

1:05:53.640 --> 1:05:55.640
 find me criticizing individuals

1:05:55.640 --> 1:05:57.640
 you'll find me criticizing

1:05:57.640 --> 1:05:59.640
 certain writing but in any

1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:01.640
 case

1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:03.640
 here's what I regret

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:05.640
 let me make a program

1:06:05.640 --> 1:06:07.640
 worthwhile

1:06:07.640 --> 1:06:09.640
 as far as I know

1:06:09.640 --> 1:06:11.640
 with the exception of not understanding

1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:13.640
 how large

1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:15.640
 the applications to condense matters

1:06:15.640 --> 1:06:17.640
 say of ADM CF

1:06:17.640 --> 1:06:19.640
 ADS CFT

1:06:19.640 --> 1:06:21.640
 would get I think

1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:23.640
 largely my

1:06:23.640 --> 1:06:25.640
 diagnosis of string theory

1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:27.640
 as it was then

1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:29.640
 has stood up since 2006

1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:31.640
 what I regret

1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:33.640
 is that

1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:35.640
 the same critique I was using

1:06:35.640 --> 1:06:37.640
 string theory as an example

1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:39.640
 and the same critique applies

1:06:39.640 --> 1:06:41.640
 to many other communities

1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:43.640
 in science and all of

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:45.640
 including and this is what I regret

1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:47.640
 my own community that is a community

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:49.640
 of people working on quantum gravity

1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:51.640
 outside string theory

1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:53.640
 but and I considered

1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:55.640
 saying that explicitly

1:06:55.640 --> 1:06:57.640
 but to say that explicitly since I'm

1:06:57.640 --> 1:06:59.640
 it's a small intimate community

1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:01.640
 I would be telling stories

1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:03.640
 and naming names of

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:05.640
 and making a kind

1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:07.640
 of history that I have no right

1:07:07.640 --> 1:07:09.640
 to write so I stayed away

1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:11.640
 from that but was misunderstood

1:07:11.640 --> 1:07:13.640
 but if I may

1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:15.640
 ask is there a hopeful message

1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:17.640
 for theoretical physics

1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:19.640
 that we can take from that book

1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:21.640
 sort of that looks at the community

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:23.640
 not just your own

1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:25.640
 work on now with causality

1:07:25.640 --> 1:07:27.640
 and nonlocality but just

1:07:27.640 --> 1:07:29.640
 broadly in understanding the fundamental

1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:31.640
 nature of our reality

1:07:31.640 --> 1:07:33.640
 what's your hope for the

1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:35.640
 21st century in physics

1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:37.640
 that we take?

1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:39.640
 What do we solve the problem?

1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:41.640
 We solve the

1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:43.640
 unfinished problem of Einstein's

1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:45.640
 that's certainly the thing

1:07:45.640 --> 1:07:47.640
 that I care about most

1:07:47.640 --> 1:07:49.640
 and hope for most

1:07:49.640 --> 1:07:51.640
 let me say one thing among the young

1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:53.640
 people that I work with

1:07:53.640 --> 1:07:55.640
 I hear very often

1:07:55.640 --> 1:07:57.640
 in sense

1:07:57.640 --> 1:07:59.640
 a total disinterest in these

1:07:59.640 --> 1:08:01.640
 arguments that we older scientists

1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:03.640
 have

1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:05.640
 and an interest in what each other is doing

1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:07.640
 and this is starting to appear

1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:09.640
 in conferences

1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:11.640
 where the young people interested

1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:13.640
 in quantum gravity make a

1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:15.640
 conference they invite loops

1:08:15.640 --> 1:08:17.640
 and strings and causal dynamical

1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:19.640
 triangulations and causal set people

1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:21.640
 and we're having

1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:23.640
 a conference like this next week

1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:25.640
 a small workshop

1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:27.640
 at perimeter and I guess I'm

1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:29.640
 out of tidiness and then in

1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:31.640
 the summer we're having a big

1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:33.640
 full on conference

1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:35.640
 which is just quantum gravity it's not strings

1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:37.640
 it's not loops but

1:08:37.640 --> 1:08:39.640
 the organizers and the speakers will be

1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:41.640
 from all the different communities

1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:43.640
 and this to me is very helpful

1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:47.640
 that the different ideas

1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:49.640
 are coming together?

1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:51.640
 At least people are expressing an interest

1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:53.640
 in that

1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:55.640
 It's a huge honor

1:08:55.640 --> 1:08:57.640

 from Lee Smolin

 God is nothing but

1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:37.640
