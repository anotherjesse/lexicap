00:00.000 --> 00:02.620
 The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio.

00:02.620 --> 00:04.500
 His second time on the podcast,

00:04.500 --> 00:06.940
 he is a legendary investor,

00:06.940 --> 00:09.100
 founder of Bridgewater Associates,

00:09.100 --> 00:12.460
 author of a book I highly recommend called Principles,

00:12.460 --> 00:16.000
 and also a new book called Principles for Dealing

00:16.000 --> 00:17.820
 with a Changing World Order,

00:17.820 --> 00:20.460
 that looks at the geopolitics of today,

00:20.460 --> 00:22.980
 especially US and China,

00:22.980 --> 00:24.580
 to the lens of history,

00:24.580 --> 00:26.100
 providing a fascinating model

00:26.100 --> 00:28.180
 for the rise and fall of empires

00:28.180 --> 00:32.180
 that can be applied to the analysis of our world today.

00:32.180 --> 00:34.300
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.240
 To support it,

00:35.240 --> 00:37.500
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:37.500 --> 00:42.060
 And now, here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.

00:42.060 --> 00:44.180
 When you look at the history of the world,

00:44.180 --> 00:45.940
 as you have done in your new book,

00:45.940 --> 00:49.740
 Principles of Dealing with a Changing World Order,

00:49.740 --> 00:53.300
 what is more important, more impactful, money or power?

00:54.360 --> 00:56.460
 They go hand in hand.

00:56.460 --> 01:01.080
 They support each other and they compete with each other.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.900
 Those who have money have power,

01:03.900 --> 01:05.340
 a certain type of power.

01:06.340 --> 01:09.580
 That power has to do with all that they can buy,

01:09.580 --> 01:13.460
 but it also has the ability to influence

01:13.460 --> 01:15.340
 those with political power.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.220
 And so you see this throughout history,

01:20.220 --> 01:22.660
 this symbiotic relationship.

01:22.660 --> 01:25.300
 You know, for example,

01:25.300 --> 01:29.700
 between the royal families,

01:29.700 --> 01:33.380
 the nobility and the church.

01:33.380 --> 01:36.140
 So you see that group of people

01:36.140 --> 01:39.060
 supporting each other in various ways,

01:39.060 --> 01:42.460
 and then wrestling around with each other

01:42.460 --> 01:45.860
 for the money and power among that group.

01:45.860 --> 01:48.620
 So the dynamic that's quite classic

01:48.620 --> 01:52.820
 is you could look at the parties in power,

01:52.820 --> 01:57.740
 back in the 16th, 17th centuries,

01:57.740 --> 02:02.740
 you would look at royal families, nobles and the church,

02:04.220 --> 02:05.540
 if you're in Europe,

02:05.540 --> 02:10.040
 and then you would look at agricultural land,

02:10.040 --> 02:12.260
 and there was a certain dynamic.

02:12.260 --> 02:15.100
 And that varies over time, it changes.

02:15.100 --> 02:20.100
 As those people get thrown out and technology changes,

02:20.460 --> 02:24.100
 so when we evolved, when the society evolved,

02:24.100 --> 02:28.020
 so that it would produce goods and services,

02:28.020 --> 02:31.940
 and you have something like the industrial revolution,

02:31.940 --> 02:35.140
 the first industrial revolution, they have machines,

02:35.140 --> 02:38.980
 and you have the talent of people that are off the farms,

02:40.020 --> 02:43.420
 and then you have a struggling for power.

02:43.420 --> 02:47.520
 You see that power mix change.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.880
 And so we don't see that same power mix anymore,

02:50.880 --> 02:53.920
 but you still see the same dynamic.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.680
 You see those with money dealing with those

02:57.680 --> 03:02.600
 who have political power around those assets

03:02.600 --> 03:04.680
 that are considered most valuable

03:04.680 --> 03:09.360
 to particularly the productive assets that produce money.

03:09.360 --> 03:14.080
 And political powers usually centered around nation state.

03:14.080 --> 03:17.880
 So the major locus is the powers, the nations.

03:17.880 --> 03:22.880
 Yes, in 1668, after 30 years of war,

03:25.160 --> 03:29.920
 there was the development of nation states.

03:29.920 --> 03:34.640
 Before then, I was really the development of countries,

03:34.640 --> 03:37.520
 as we know it, that there were borders,

03:37.520 --> 03:40.440
 and that within those borders,

03:40.440 --> 03:43.960
 those who had control got to control it,

03:43.960 --> 03:48.100
 and there would not to be intrusions in those borders,

03:48.100 --> 03:51.540
 and that's how we established the nation state.

03:51.540 --> 03:56.440
 And then of course, within each country, there is levels.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.640
 There is a central level,

03:59.640 --> 04:02.700
 and then there is a typically a province

04:02.700 --> 04:05.360
 or state level down below,

04:05.360 --> 04:06.980
 and then there's a municipal level,

04:06.980 --> 04:10.680
 so that each have different levels of power,

04:10.680 --> 04:14.460
 and it's the coordination of those

04:14.460 --> 04:17.940
 that determines how the country is run.

04:19.260 --> 04:23.360
 You write that the quote archetypal big cycle

04:23.360 --> 04:25.880
 governs the rising and declining empires

04:25.880 --> 04:27.920
 and influences everything about them,

04:27.920 --> 04:30.360
 including their currencies and markets.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.800
 The most important three cycles

04:31.800 --> 04:35.120
 are the ones you mentioned in the introduction,

04:35.120 --> 04:38.240
 the long term debt and capital market cycle,

04:38.240 --> 04:40.560
 the internal order and disorder cycle,

04:40.560 --> 04:44.660
 and the external order and disorder cycle.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.400
 Can you describe this big cycle?

04:48.380 --> 04:49.680
 There are two orders.

04:50.680 --> 04:55.680
 There is an order by a system, how the system works.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.640
 So there's an internal order,

05:01.640 --> 05:04.120
 that is the internal governance system,

05:04.120 --> 05:06.760
 and it's usually set out in a constitution

05:06.760 --> 05:08.600
 or some agreements,

05:08.600 --> 05:12.720
 and then there's the world order, how the world system.

05:12.720 --> 05:17.720
 So for example, in 1945, at the end of a war,

05:18.440 --> 05:22.280
 which is basically a fight for determining the world order,

05:23.320 --> 05:27.640
 the winners of the fight got together

05:27.640 --> 05:32.440
 and created the world system as we now know it.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.960
 In 1944, they created the Bretton Woods monetary system

05:35.960 --> 05:38.640
 that determined the money, pretty much,

05:38.640 --> 05:41.440
 and because the United States won

05:41.440 --> 05:44.160
 and had 80% of the world's money,

05:44.160 --> 05:47.200
 gold was money then and it has 80% of the world's gold

05:47.200 --> 05:48.800
 and it was half the world economy

05:48.800 --> 05:51.480
 and it was the great military power,

05:51.480 --> 05:55.280
 the order was built around an American world order

05:55.280 --> 05:58.460
 so that the United Nations was in New York,

05:58.460 --> 06:00.960
 the World Bank and the IMF were in Washington

06:00.960 --> 06:02.760
 and they built that new order.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.600
 So classically, you have a war

06:05.600 --> 06:08.640
 to determine whose rules were following

06:08.640 --> 06:13.400
 and then you have the new order being constructed.

06:13.400 --> 06:18.040
 After that, there is usually period of extended peace

06:18.040 --> 06:20.760
 and prosperity.

06:20.760 --> 06:25.280
 Peace suits prosperity and so there's not,

06:25.280 --> 06:27.000
 and the reason you have the peace

06:27.000 --> 06:31.800
 is because no one wants to fight with the dominant power,

06:31.800 --> 06:34.080
 you know you're gonna lose, you've surrendered,

06:34.080 --> 06:36.560
 there's been the surrendering, they carve up the world,

06:36.560 --> 06:38.480
 they say what it's gonna look like,

06:38.480 --> 06:42.480
 who's gonna control what and then you come into

06:42.480 --> 06:46.680
 that period of peace and then prosperity

06:46.680 --> 06:50.840
 where then there's a working together.

06:50.840 --> 06:55.840
 Usually at that point, you've wiped out a lot of the debt,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.680
 you've wiped out a lot of the issues,

07:00.680 --> 07:02.960
 the class warfare and so on

07:02.960 --> 07:04.840
 and then there's good working together.

07:04.840 --> 07:09.840
 So those great periods such as the industrial revolution

07:10.640 --> 07:15.280
 in the late 1800s or what we've experienced

07:15.280 --> 07:18.000
 in the post World War II period are peaceful

07:18.000 --> 07:21.240
 and prosperous periods led largely

07:21.240 --> 07:23.520
 by the dominant world power.

07:23.520 --> 07:28.520
 Over a period of time, since really 1500 and maybe before,

07:29.360 --> 07:34.360
 but really 1500 when the Dutch invented capitalism

07:35.800 --> 07:37.000
 and what I mean by that,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.600
 they invented the first capital markets,

07:39.600 --> 07:42.560
 the first stocks and the first stock market,

07:43.560 --> 07:47.400
 that since then capitalism has been an effective tool

07:47.400 --> 07:50.800
 for building wealth because it got resources

07:50.800 --> 07:54.000
 into the hands of inventive people.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.520
 That's when we move from agriculture

07:56.520 --> 07:58.840
 to the importance of inventiveness of people,

07:58.840 --> 08:03.480
 they got resources and then they built that prosperity.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.000
 In that process of doing that,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.040
 they create wealth gaps naturally.

08:09.040 --> 08:13.160
 Those who make a lot of money make a lot more

08:13.160 --> 08:15.000
 and then those that don't.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
 And it also produces opportunity gaps

08:20.200 --> 08:25.000
 because for example, those who earn a lot of money

08:25.000 --> 08:26.520
 have that wealth.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.360
 They have the power to educate their children

08:29.360 --> 08:34.360
 in a way that others don't and the gaps grow

08:34.920 --> 08:38.560
 and also the debts grow at that time.

08:38.560 --> 08:43.560
 When they go around the world with their competitiveness,

08:43.560 --> 08:46.080
 they earn a lot of money.

08:46.080 --> 08:49.040
 So for example, the Dutch, the Dutch empire,

08:49.040 --> 08:54.040
 learned how to build ships that would go around the world.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.000
 A key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle

08:58.000 --> 09:01.680
 is the improvement of education and by education,

09:01.680 --> 09:04.280
 I mean the skills that come from education,

09:04.280 --> 09:08.680
 but also civility, the ability to deal with wealth together.

09:08.680 --> 09:12.360
 So the Dutch invented ships that could go around the world

09:12.360 --> 09:13.720
 and they had military power,

09:13.720 --> 09:16.400
 but they were also very inventive society.

09:16.400 --> 09:21.400
 25% of the world's new inventions came from the Dutch.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.720
 And so as they went around the world,

09:23.720 --> 09:26.200
 they also brought their currency

09:26.200 --> 09:28.240
 and they brought their military.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.640
 They needed the currency, they paid for things

09:31.640 --> 09:34.640
 and that currency and then the more that happens,

09:34.640 --> 09:37.960
 the more that becomes a reserve currency

09:37.960 --> 09:40.120
 and then they have their military.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.000
 So they need their military strength

09:42.000 --> 09:45.960
 and so you see it evolve in all of those ways.

09:45.960 --> 09:50.960
 But over a period of time as they become more successful

09:51.120 --> 09:55.240
 and more expensive, they become more expensive.

09:56.800 --> 10:01.800
 And newer countries come along like the UK

10:03.160 --> 10:07.800
 then learn to build ships from a lot the Dutch

10:07.800 --> 10:10.480
 and could do that less expensively.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.440
 And also when they become more expensive,

10:14.440 --> 10:17.520
 so less competitive and also the work ethic

10:17.520 --> 10:19.080
 begins to change.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.680
 They believe that since they're richer,

10:20.680 --> 10:22.640
 they can enjoy life more.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.240
 They don't have to work quite as hard.

10:25.240 --> 10:28.040
 And so you start to see the tilt.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.160
 Now you started to see the development of the top.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.360
 And when you have a world reserve currency,

10:34.360 --> 10:37.000
 that allows you to borrow a lot of money

10:37.000 --> 10:41.920
 because those who want to save want to hold your money

10:41.920 --> 10:44.040
 and that means that they'll lend you money.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.120
 And so those countries get deeper into debt.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.360
 So you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness

10:51.360 --> 10:56.280
 and they get themselves into financial circumstances,

10:56.280 --> 11:01.280
 which are not good, and they have large wealth gaps,

11:01.440 --> 11:04.640
 which set the stage for downturns.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.640
 And when they have downturns, the first question is,

11:08.640 --> 11:10.120
 do they have enough money?

11:10.120 --> 11:15.120
 And traditionally, money is resources.

11:15.640 --> 11:20.000
 So you classically see that the coffers are bare,

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
 that they're spending more money than they are earning

11:25.240 --> 11:28.920
 and they run out of money in the coffers.

11:28.920 --> 11:33.200
 And their granaries are empty rather than stocked

11:33.200 --> 11:35.360
 so that they give them the buffer.

11:35.360 --> 11:40.360
 And as that deteriorates, that worsens conditions.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.480
 And if they have a rival power that's also challenging them,

11:44.480 --> 11:48.840
 they see greater internal conflict over wealth.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.440
 And then they have the problems internally

11:52.440 --> 11:54.120
 and the problems externally,

11:54.120 --> 11:57.680
 which usually results in an internal war

11:57.680 --> 12:01.360
 or an external war that leads to the change

12:01.360 --> 12:03.000
 and to the new world order.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.800
 And to you, the Dutch empire is a good example

12:06.800 --> 12:11.120
 that the British, what are some of the key examples

12:11.120 --> 12:14.360
 that you think about in the book of this process

12:14.360 --> 12:16.280
 that follow the big cycle?

12:16.280 --> 12:19.160
 Well, the leading reserve currency empires,

12:19.160 --> 12:21.420
 but it applies to all the empires,

12:23.000 --> 12:27.760
 were the Dutch, the British, the American and the Chinese.

12:27.760 --> 12:32.640
 But you could follow the same pattern.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.440
 In the book, it was very important for me

12:35.440 --> 12:39.000
 to not just use words and concepts

12:39.000 --> 12:41.360
 because that's subjective.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.800
 It was very important for me to use actual measurements.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.480
 So as you see in the book, you can see every level of this.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.040
 You can see where's the education level,

12:52.040 --> 12:55.560
 what is the military power, each one of those,

12:55.560 --> 12:59.320
 and you can see them back going over the 500 years.

12:59.320 --> 13:04.320
 And so you can see the arcs and the composition of those arcs.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.240
 And what you see is really in most countries

13:08.240 --> 13:10.800
 and most dynasties, you can see that.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.520
 But you also can see through those numbers

13:13.520 --> 13:16.000
 the health of those countries.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.400
 Today, there are statistics that you could,

13:20.400 --> 13:23.840
 that are in the book, that show what is the level

13:23.840 --> 13:28.280
 of education, what is the level of economic output,

13:28.280 --> 13:32.160
 what is the level of military strength,

13:32.160 --> 13:33.640
 what is the level of a number

13:33.640 --> 13:35.680
 of different measures of strength

13:35.680 --> 13:38.040
 so that you can then compare that.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.560
 And I think that because they're objective measures

13:40.560 --> 13:43.340
 of strength that you could see change,

13:44.400 --> 13:48.160
 that shows the picture of where we are today.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.200
 And I think one of the most important things

13:50.200 --> 13:54.360
 about the book is that it allows people to monitor

13:54.360 --> 13:56.680
 how those things are transpiring.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.760
 I think for policy makers,

14:00.600 --> 14:03.200
 are your policy makers doing a good job?

14:03.200 --> 14:06.320
 And there's so much subjectivity in that.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.320
 But I think it's very simple.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.920
 If those lines on the chart are improving,

14:10.920 --> 14:13.320
 if your health index is improving,

14:13.320 --> 14:17.660
 then you're moving toward a better life.

14:17.660 --> 14:20.240
 So that's what the book works like also.

14:20.240 --> 14:24.120
 It was used to create a model for the future.

14:24.120 --> 14:28.200
 In other words, there are cause effect relationships.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.060
 Everything that happens has reasons, causes,

14:32.060 --> 14:34.880
 that preceded it, that made it happen.

14:34.880 --> 14:38.000
 And so by having all those in numbers,

14:38.000 --> 14:42.440
 one can see the probabilities of certain things happening.

14:42.440 --> 14:46.760
 So that's what you see in the book.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.920
 It's not just raise interpretation.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.920
 I didn't wanna make it raise interpretation

14:51.920 --> 14:53.840
 because I don't know if I'm right.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.200
 Yeah, so one of the fascinating things in the book,

14:56.200 --> 14:58.800
 see I've listed these 18 measures.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.480
 And there's like a little scorecard

15:01.480 --> 15:04.360
 for the countries of the world today.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.760
 So let's say US, China and Europe.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.960
 And what it was 20 years ago,

15:09.960 --> 15:11.960
 I'm looking at the change from 20 years ago.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.600
 And that's another indicator,

15:13.600 --> 15:17.240
 the change itself to see where things are headed.

15:17.240 --> 15:21.560
 Maybe can you comment on, from a score perspective,

15:21.560 --> 15:24.140
 how is US and China doing?

15:24.140 --> 15:26.720
 And in the 18 measures, what are some measures

15:26.720 --> 15:29.480
 that stand out to you as particularly important

15:29.480 --> 15:32.540
 to think about today for the United States, for China?

15:33.440 --> 15:34.480
 Well, there are a number.

15:35.760 --> 15:40.760
 Financially, what you see in the United States

15:40.760 --> 15:44.820
 is that we're borrowing a lot more money,

15:44.820 --> 15:46.680
 creating a lot of debt,

15:46.680 --> 15:50.340
 and we're printing a lot of money.

15:50.340 --> 15:54.420
 And our capacity to do that is very much,

15:54.420 --> 15:55.780
 is limited, first of all,

15:55.780 --> 15:59.860
 because when there's a sale of a bond,

15:59.860 --> 16:03.780
 when the government borrows more than it,

16:03.780 --> 16:07.400
 borrows money because it spends more than it takes in,

16:08.360 --> 16:10.340
 you have to sell a bond.

16:10.340 --> 16:12.860
 And the world right now has a lot

16:12.860 --> 16:14.820
 of US dollar denominated bonds

16:14.820 --> 16:17.260
 because as the world's reserve currency,

16:17.260 --> 16:18.940
 they sell, so on them.

16:18.940 --> 16:23.940
 And they have very bad returns, negative real returns,

16:24.420 --> 16:27.780
 negative real returns significantly and so on.

16:27.780 --> 16:32.620
 So that means that more bonds has to be sold

16:32.620 --> 16:36.700
 than are bought.

16:36.700 --> 16:40.040
 And that means that the Federal Reserve

16:40.040 --> 16:42.040
 has, is faced with the choice

16:42.040 --> 16:45.140
 of having to raise the interest rate

16:45.140 --> 16:48.780
 to curtail borrowing, which slows the economy

16:48.780 --> 16:49.980
 and hurts the markets,

16:49.980 --> 16:53.380
 or by filling that difference

16:53.380 --> 16:56.940
 and producing money, the debt monetization,

16:56.940 --> 17:00.620
 which produces an inflation in goods,

17:00.620 --> 17:03.460
 services, and financial assets.

17:03.460 --> 17:08.460
 So in that regard, that's the United States's position.

17:08.460 --> 17:13.460
 In China's case, its balance of payments is better.

17:15.060 --> 17:18.540
 China has displaced the United States

17:18.540 --> 17:21.700
 as the world's largest trading country.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.380
 In other words, more exports to other countries.

17:24.380 --> 17:29.380
 And as a result, it's economically competitive,

17:29.740 --> 17:32.340
 but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency.

17:32.340 --> 17:33.740
 It's a real blessing.

17:33.740 --> 17:37.500
 So the United States, it has the world's reserve currency,

17:37.500 --> 17:40.980
 but it is risking it because of this imbalance.

17:40.980 --> 17:45.340
 So if you look at history, you see that those go slowly,

17:45.340 --> 17:48.980
 but when they go, eventually, they go quickly.

17:50.060 --> 17:54.780
 So there's a risk of that financially.

17:54.780 --> 17:58.460
 Then there's the issue of internal order.

17:58.460 --> 18:00.220
 So I'm just giving you the major ones,

18:00.220 --> 18:02.660
 but I'll get into some of the other ones too.

18:02.660 --> 18:06.860
 Right now, there's a lot of internal conflict

18:06.860 --> 18:11.860
 in the United States, which affects how well it works.

18:14.220 --> 18:17.620
 In China, there's less internal conflict

18:17.620 --> 18:20.700
 because it's a more autocratic state,

18:20.700 --> 18:24.420
 but also they've created this bifurcation

18:25.780 --> 18:29.660
 what is political and what is economic

18:29.660 --> 18:31.980
 in terms of producing that prosperity.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.660
 So if you stay out of the politics pretty much,

18:34.660 --> 18:39.620
 and then you're seeing entrepreneurship,

18:39.620 --> 18:44.340
 you're seeing the finances of new businesses and so on.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.820
 And so that internal working,

18:48.020 --> 18:51.300
 that's subject to different people's interpretations,

18:51.300 --> 18:52.540
 whether they like it or not,

18:52.540 --> 18:54.540
 but the internal conflict

18:54.540 --> 18:57.940
 in terms of those kinds of measures is less.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.140
 Sorry to pause on that for a second.

19:00.140 --> 19:05.140
 So these measures, I guess you don't want to sort of romanticize

19:06.020 --> 19:07.820
 any one measure or something like that

19:07.820 --> 19:09.980
 overinterpret any one measure,

19:09.980 --> 19:13.940
 but is internal conflict always a bad thing?

19:13.940 --> 19:18.300
 Is it a complicated calculation,

19:18.300 --> 19:19.140
 or do you kind of,

19:19.140 --> 19:20.580
 the way we think about these measures

19:20.580 --> 19:21.420
 that you've presented,

19:21.420 --> 19:24.900
 we should be thinking like the higher, the better,

19:24.900 --> 19:27.100
 the lower, worse, or I mean, of course,

19:27.100 --> 19:27.940
 depending on the measure.

19:27.940 --> 19:32.940
 In many cases, the conflict that produces the revolution

19:33.860 --> 19:37.020
 produces revolutionary changes

19:37.020 --> 19:42.020
 that lead to resolutions and lead to new starts.

19:44.580 --> 19:48.140
 And so their short term,

19:48.140 --> 19:52.900
 a short term civil war is a hellacious experience.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.580
 And at the same time,

19:54.580 --> 19:58.980
 it can be the transition to a new beginning.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.740
 Also, there are different types of conflict.

20:03.780 --> 20:07.300
 Competition, which makes things,

20:07.300 --> 20:12.300
 makes everything better is a productive conflict,

20:12.780 --> 20:17.780
 whereas destructive conflicts are not good

20:18.820 --> 20:20.940
 over the short time.

20:20.940 --> 20:23.620
 So that's how those go.

20:23.620 --> 20:28.620
 So within each measure, the story is complicated.

20:29.180 --> 20:32.300
 Yeah, but my measures are sort of clear,

20:32.300 --> 20:35.220
 meaning how much political conflict,

20:35.220 --> 20:38.820
 how much social conflict,

20:38.820 --> 20:40.660
 in other words, you can measure conflict,

20:40.660 --> 20:41.860
 you can measure fighting,

20:41.860 --> 20:44.260
 you can measure crime rates,

20:44.260 --> 20:49.260
 you can measure lots of different ways of conflict.

20:49.660 --> 20:52.420
 So the measures are a composite

20:52.420 --> 20:55.620
 of different types of internal conflict.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.860
 What are some other interesting measures?

20:57.860 --> 20:59.940
 Maybe if you could also mention that

20:59.940 --> 21:03.300
 for me in particular interest is education and innovation.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.500
 Yes.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.860
 The classic cycle,

21:05.860 --> 21:08.740
 the most important leading indicator

21:08.740 --> 21:11.220
 is the quality of education.

21:11.220 --> 21:16.060
 Most importantly, broad based education

21:16.060 --> 21:18.860
 drawn from the largest population

21:18.860 --> 21:23.580
 because you can never tell who the talent is going to be,

21:23.580 --> 21:25.060
 where they're gonna come from.

21:25.060 --> 21:28.140
 So for example, if you look at the Chinese dynasties,

21:28.140 --> 21:33.140
 the great Chinese dynasties and the Confucian approach,

21:33.180 --> 21:38.180
 it was meritocratic of everybody could sit for exams

21:38.540 --> 21:41.540
 and so on, broad base of drawing in the populations.

21:41.540 --> 21:44.180
 And you see that if you go across societies

21:44.180 --> 21:49.060
 because that draws on the largest number of population

21:49.060 --> 21:50.980
 to get education.

21:50.980 --> 21:55.980
 And it also, that creates a reality and a perception

21:58.260 --> 22:01.340
 that the system is fairer, equal opportunity,

22:01.340 --> 22:03.020
 not just one of privilege.

22:03.020 --> 22:06.340
 And that helps to create social stability.

22:06.340 --> 22:11.340
 But education is not just education in understanding facts

22:11.340 --> 22:16.340
 and so on, it is education in civility

22:17.740 --> 22:19.260
 of how to behave together.

22:19.260 --> 22:21.260
 And so if they're smart,

22:21.260 --> 22:23.940
 they understand how to be productive

22:23.940 --> 22:27.340
 because they work well together and they're productive.

22:27.340 --> 22:30.180
 And then that leads to the next stage.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.860
 You could see in the lines in the charts,

22:32.860 --> 22:37.660
 I plotted these so that you could see in a typical cycle,

22:37.660 --> 22:42.540
 you could see that education is the long leading indicator.

22:42.540 --> 22:45.380
 And then you could see, as you mentioned,

22:45.380 --> 22:47.660
 that what you see is inventiveness

22:47.660 --> 22:51.020
 and technology measures then follow.

22:51.020 --> 22:54.140
 And you see then also competitiveness

22:54.140 --> 22:55.900
 and world markets follows.

22:55.900 --> 22:59.100
 For example, in the early stages of a cycle,

22:59.100 --> 23:03.300
 the industries that they go into tend to be

23:03.300 --> 23:06.180
 very basic industry because they have cheap labor,

23:06.180 --> 23:10.420
 something like textiles and simple manufactured goods

23:10.420 --> 23:11.260
 and so on.

23:11.260 --> 23:13.540
 But as the education rises,

23:13.540 --> 23:18.540
 then they move up the value chain to greater technologies

23:19.060 --> 23:23.140
 and so on, which raises incomes and raises productivity.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.900
 So yes, those and as you say,

23:25.900 --> 23:28.260
 there are 18 different measures like that,

23:28.260 --> 23:32.700
 but education and then civility and the inventiveness.

23:32.700 --> 23:37.060
 So you see it reflected in who's inventing what.

23:38.020 --> 23:41.740
 And that corresponds then who's trading with,

23:41.740 --> 23:43.580
 who's a big trading country?

23:43.580 --> 23:46.180
 And where's the value of economic output

23:46.180 --> 23:47.740
 and what are per capita incomes?

23:47.740 --> 23:49.700
 They all follow those arcs.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.740
 Yeah, like you said, the fascinating thing about your book,

23:53.740 --> 23:58.740
 so there's philosophy, there's wisdom, but there's plots.

23:58.740 --> 24:01.020
 Yeah, you could see it.

24:01.020 --> 24:03.580
 So it's not just your opinion, it's kind of like

24:03.580 --> 24:06.340
 you can interpret it in any way you like,

24:06.340 --> 24:09.620
 but you're just giving a lot of your own insights

24:09.620 --> 24:10.700
 along with the numbers.

24:12.060 --> 24:15.620
 If you were to look at the American nation,

24:15.620 --> 24:18.780
 the American empire and the trajectories looking

24:18.780 --> 24:21.460
 into the future, given these measures,

24:22.660 --> 24:25.980
 what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse

24:25.980 --> 24:28.860
 of the American empire based on these measures?

24:28.860 --> 24:30.580
 What are the concerning indicators?

24:30.580 --> 24:34.540
 And if those break down further, what does that look like?

24:35.540 --> 24:40.540
 Well, all of those indicators are concerning,

24:42.500 --> 24:47.500
 maybe except for one, which is technology,

24:48.020 --> 24:52.100
 the technology niche, although even in that area

24:52.100 --> 24:57.100
 of the United States is improving at a slower rate

24:57.100 --> 25:01.500
 than is China for various advantages that they have there.

25:01.500 --> 25:05.020
 They put out about eight times as many computer engineers,

25:05.020 --> 25:07.500
 they have free data, and so on.

25:07.500 --> 25:12.500
 But if you look at them, so the financial is a concern,

25:13.100 --> 25:18.100
 the internal order, disorder is a concern.

25:18.460 --> 25:21.180
 Then if you look at education levels,

25:21.180 --> 25:25.740
 the United States is in many ways is losing

25:25.740 --> 25:27.940
 its educational advantage.

25:27.940 --> 25:30.940
 If you were to compare it with China,

25:32.260 --> 25:36.740
 if you take general public education in the United States,

25:36.740 --> 25:39.660
 it's deteriorated tremendously,

25:39.660 --> 25:42.580
 even in comparison to developed countries.

25:42.580 --> 25:44.660
 There are scores, pieces scores, and so on,

25:44.660 --> 25:47.660
 and it's something like 38th in the world or something,

25:47.660 --> 25:51.220
 and that was a big plunge, average public education.

25:51.220 --> 25:54.660
 If you look at the best universities in the world,

25:54.660 --> 25:56.380
 the United States is unique

25:56.380 --> 25:58.660
 in having the best universities in the world.

25:58.660 --> 26:03.660
 So there are these privileged spots that are excellent,

26:04.940 --> 26:06.180
 uniquely excellent.

26:06.180 --> 26:09.020
 So when you look at the comparison,

26:09.020 --> 26:13.500
 education in China is improving rapidly,

26:13.500 --> 26:18.500
 and the quantity is a quantity of educated people

26:18.900 --> 26:23.340
 in the areas that they're moving in are, is greater,

26:23.340 --> 26:27.060
 and the resources that they're putting behind it is greater,

26:27.060 --> 26:29.340
 and so you see the results are greater,

26:30.340 --> 26:34.300
 but it's sort of along the lines that I'm dealing with.

26:34.300 --> 26:39.300
 If you were to follow through in terms of actual productions,

26:40.180 --> 26:44.820
 I think, you know, in terms of technologies,

26:44.820 --> 26:48.820
 there are some areas that the United States is in a lead.

26:48.820 --> 26:51.700
 At the moment, there's some areas that China's in a lead,

26:51.700 --> 26:54.780
 but China's gaining very quickly.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.980
 When I first went to China, 1984,

26:57.980 --> 27:00.940
 I would bring $10 calculators,

27:00.940 --> 27:04.860
 and I gave them away as gifts to high ranking people,

27:04.860 --> 27:07.180
 and they thought they were miracle devices.

27:08.540 --> 27:13.100
 Right now, in terms of areas like quantum computing

27:13.100 --> 27:18.060
 and AI and, you know, many areas,

27:18.060 --> 27:20.260
 you have a race going on,

27:20.260 --> 27:24.660
 and so if you take the trajectory of the competitiveness,

27:24.660 --> 27:26.740
 not just look at the current level,

27:26.740 --> 27:29.140
 you have a situation where they're improving

27:29.140 --> 27:31.060
 at a much faster rate.

27:31.060 --> 27:33.180
 This is all good for the world,

27:33.180 --> 27:34.820
 if the world can get along.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.420
 And the main thing I think is,

27:40.620 --> 27:44.180
 in just, how do you have a healthy world,

27:44.180 --> 27:45.740
 and how do you have a strong economy,

27:45.740 --> 27:49.740
 and how do you have a strong situation, is be strong.

27:49.740 --> 27:53.420
 The United States's war is with itself.

27:53.420 --> 27:55.180
 That's the main war.

27:55.180 --> 27:57.220
 You know, it's very simple in history.

27:59.380 --> 28:02.820
 Be financially sound, earn more than you spend,

28:04.540 --> 28:07.980
 and be strong in these ways,

28:07.980 --> 28:10.500
 and pretty much everything will take care of itself.

28:13.100 --> 28:15.020
 But you make it sound simple, of course,

28:15.020 --> 28:17.820
 because there's a momentum when things degrade.

28:17.820 --> 28:21.580
 When the education system degrades, when you start borrowing,

28:21.580 --> 28:23.980
 when, I mean, all of these indicators,

28:23.980 --> 28:26.020
 once they start going down,

28:26.020 --> 28:28.260
 there's a momentum to it, right?

28:28.260 --> 28:30.020
 So it's hard to reverse it.

28:30.020 --> 28:33.500
 Right, and there are circumstances that you're then in.

28:33.500 --> 28:37.260
 For example, indebtedness, you know,

28:37.260 --> 28:40.980
 it's politically desirable

28:40.980 --> 28:44.580
 for those to borrow money and spend,

28:44.580 --> 28:49.100
 because their constituencies only look at what they get.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.660
 And when they get a lot,

28:50.660 --> 28:52.980
 they don't pay attention to the balance sheet

28:52.980 --> 28:54.980
 and how much debt is on the books.

28:54.980 --> 28:58.460
 So it's always better to borrow, spend,

28:58.460 --> 29:01.700
 and then leave the cleanup to the next guy.

29:01.700 --> 29:04.660
 And so you inherit a lot.

29:04.660 --> 29:09.260
 You inherit it as a new president enters in,

29:09.260 --> 29:11.420
 or new legislators.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.220
 They have a lot of debt.

29:13.220 --> 29:17.300
 They have a broken down infrastructure.

29:17.300 --> 29:20.620
 They don't have enough money to fix that.

29:20.620 --> 29:23.220
 And so that's the lay of the land

29:23.220 --> 29:27.460
 that the prior generations put you in.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.020
 And there you are.

29:29.020 --> 29:31.380
 And so that's right.

29:31.380 --> 29:33.740
 It's difficult, because when you start to think,

29:33.740 --> 29:35.220
 okay, what's healthy?

29:35.220 --> 29:37.780
 Well, earn more than you spend.

29:37.780 --> 29:39.500
 Well, that's not so easy,

29:39.500 --> 29:41.860
 because, you know, what does that mean?

29:41.860 --> 29:43.300
 Go earn more?

29:43.300 --> 29:45.700
 I mean, okay, that's not so easy.

29:45.700 --> 29:48.940
 Spend less, that isn't gonna work.

29:48.940 --> 29:50.540
 So now what do you do?

29:50.540 --> 29:54.100
 Okay, you have this debt that you then monetize,

29:54.100 --> 29:55.580
 and that's why it's classic.

29:55.580 --> 29:57.660
 So yes, that's why these cycles occur,

29:57.660 --> 30:00.660
 because what has created before,

30:00.660 --> 30:03.300
 what happened before created the lay of the land

30:03.300 --> 30:06.340
 that is then increasingly difficult to deal with.

30:06.340 --> 30:08.620
 So what can great leaders do in this moment?

30:08.620 --> 30:13.500
 I mean, maybe my sense is leadership is crucial here.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.180
 So for example, to do very large projects

30:16.180 --> 30:18.260
 that invest in the education system,

30:18.260 --> 30:21.900
 that sort of try to fix the fundamentals,

30:21.900 --> 30:25.900
 or maybe invest more and more into the innovation

30:25.900 --> 30:28.460
 and the development of new technologies and so on.

30:29.500 --> 30:32.860
 It feels like that just doesn't happen organically.

30:33.900 --> 30:37.660
 So you have to have strong leaders

30:37.660 --> 30:42.660
 that convince the populace of the importance of these ideas.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.620
 Well, I completely agree with your list.

30:46.620 --> 30:50.380
 What we have is a situation where everybody

30:50.380 --> 30:52.220
 has their opinions,

30:52.220 --> 30:54.740
 and they have to sort of get them exactly right,

30:54.740 --> 30:56.660
 and they all fight with each other

30:56.660 --> 30:58.260
 about whether their opinions.

30:58.260 --> 31:03.260
 So the most important thing is that we become bipartisan

31:03.500 --> 31:07.020
 so that we don't, and we get over our differences.

31:07.020 --> 31:10.260
 I would have a bipartisan cabinet.

31:10.260 --> 31:15.260
 I would draw upon both members of both parties,

31:15.460 --> 31:19.500
 the moderates, who are going to be able to work together.

31:20.420 --> 31:24.300
 So as then we have one country,

31:24.300 --> 31:27.780
 and then we deal with those in a means

31:27.780 --> 31:30.140
 that works for the majority of the people

31:30.140 --> 31:32.460
 in the middle rather than the polarity.

31:32.460 --> 31:37.460
 I think our greatest risk is in not being able to do that.

31:38.020 --> 31:42.220
 So I would say that's of paramount importance

31:42.220 --> 31:47.220
 because we have the resources, you know, wealth,

31:47.220 --> 31:50.020
 real wealth and science and everything

31:50.020 --> 31:52.460
 has never been better than it is.

31:52.460 --> 31:54.620
 But the notion is that it has to work

31:54.620 --> 31:56.740
 for the majority of people,

31:56.740 --> 32:00.340
 and we have to keep it being productive.

32:00.340 --> 32:05.340
 So that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably

32:05.340 --> 32:09.780
 work together so that they increase the size of the pie

32:09.780 --> 32:12.660
 and they create broad based prosperity.

32:12.660 --> 32:15.660
 So that is of paramount importance.

32:15.660 --> 32:18.900
 Whatever they do, if they do it that way,

32:18.900 --> 32:20.980
 I can say I'm happy about

32:20.980 --> 32:23.300
 because that other alternative

32:23.300 --> 32:25.820
 is the really scary alternative.

32:25.820 --> 32:30.820
 The scary alternative,

32:32.540 --> 32:35.860
 the different ways it has evolved throughout history,

32:35.860 --> 32:38.020
 some of it has led to wars.

32:39.460 --> 32:41.740
 What are the future trajectories

32:41.740 --> 32:44.420
 that lead to a potential war with China?

32:44.420 --> 32:46.980
 Cold war or hot war?

32:46.980 --> 32:48.260
 Is this something you think about?

32:48.260 --> 32:50.260
 Is this something you're worried about?

32:50.260 --> 32:52.380
 Yeah, I'd like to talk about both wars.

32:52.380 --> 32:54.500
 So the war with China,

32:54.500 --> 32:56.860
 as I say, there are five kinds of wars.

32:56.860 --> 33:00.980
 There's a trade war, technology war,

33:00.980 --> 33:03.060
 geopolitical influence war,

33:03.940 --> 33:07.300
 capital war and military war.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.740
 As far as military war goes,

33:10.740 --> 33:13.940
 I think it's only a Taiwan issue,

33:14.820 --> 33:16.540
 but that's a big issue.

33:16.540 --> 33:18.780
 And we could talk about that for a minute.

33:18.780 --> 33:22.980
 But those others, there'll be rough competitions

33:22.980 --> 33:27.620
 and we'll have that type of evolution over a period of time.

33:27.620 --> 33:30.420
 That's what that war looks like.

33:30.420 --> 33:34.140
 Taiwan has been, for a long time,

33:35.940 --> 33:38.460
 a sovereignty issue to China.

33:40.540 --> 33:44.260
 And it has its roots in what's called

33:44.260 --> 33:46.100
 100 years of humiliation.

33:47.140 --> 33:50.700
 From the 1840s to 1949,

33:50.700 --> 33:54.820
 foreign powers came in, took advantage of China.

33:54.820 --> 33:57.460
 They had the opium wars in such times.

33:59.180 --> 34:03.020
 And that represented the 100 years of humiliation.

34:03.020 --> 34:08.020
 And Taiwan represents their sovereignty

34:09.100 --> 34:10.980
 and their important thing.

34:10.980 --> 34:14.620
 And 50 years ago, starting 50 years ago,

34:14.620 --> 34:18.380
 there was an agreement that there is one China

34:18.380 --> 34:21.540
 and Taiwan is part of China

34:21.540 --> 34:26.540
 and that there would be peaceful reunification.

34:26.980 --> 34:31.420
 The peaceful reunification hasn't happened.

34:31.420 --> 34:34.900
 And in their view, that's a very big issue.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.500
 And so it's a big contentious issue.

34:37.500 --> 34:41.780
 And that could produce a military war,

34:41.780 --> 34:43.500
 could produce a military accident,

34:43.500 --> 34:46.100
 could produce, it's a very tense situation.

34:46.100 --> 34:49.740
 And if we had a military war, God help us

34:49.740 --> 34:53.620
 because of the capacity in all different new ways

34:53.620 --> 34:56.380
 to inflict harm on each other.

34:56.380 --> 34:58.660
 But anyway, that's that.

34:58.660 --> 35:01.660
 If you don't have that military war,

35:01.660 --> 35:03.380
 you'll have the competition

35:03.380 --> 35:06.300
 between those other kinds of wars.

35:06.300 --> 35:11.300
 And whoever is strongest in those areas will win.

35:11.380 --> 35:14.660
 Where do you put cyber war within the five?

35:14.660 --> 35:17.140
 Well, cyber war is a military war.

35:17.140 --> 35:19.940
 I'm assuming the type of cyber war

35:19.940 --> 35:23.620
 that you're referring to is that which it's used

35:23.620 --> 35:26.780
 to inflict pain on the other party through cyber.

35:26.780 --> 35:29.700
 So cyber wars, you'll see cyber war.

35:29.700 --> 35:31.900
 You could see space war.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.900
 You can see drone warfare.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.580
 You, new types of warfare,

35:37.580 --> 35:42.660
 not just the traditional and nuclear type of warfare,

35:42.660 --> 35:44.660
 but you could see any of the above.

35:46.140 --> 35:48.860
 What are the defining characteristics?

35:48.860 --> 35:51.700
 What are the interesting things about Xi Jinping,

35:51.700 --> 35:55.900
 the president of China, as a leader on the world stage?

35:55.900 --> 36:00.900
 His father was a early leader.

36:01.660 --> 36:06.660
 He was himself in the Cultural Revolution in times,

36:06.660 --> 36:11.660
 in the Cultural Revolution in times, treated brutally.

36:13.220 --> 36:17.700
 And during that period of time, it was very, very difficult.

36:17.700 --> 36:21.420
 And he came up through the ranks

36:21.420 --> 36:25.180
 and he's a very intelligent man.

36:26.460 --> 36:29.220
 When he first came to power,

36:29.220 --> 36:32.060
 as you know, they have two five year terms

36:32.060 --> 36:35.100
 and we're now coming to the end of the second

36:35.100 --> 36:36.700
 of those five year terms.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.940
 When he first came to power,

36:38.940 --> 36:42.820
 he felt that there should be a lot of reform

36:42.820 --> 36:47.540
 and reform meant moving to much more of a market

36:47.540 --> 36:49.340
 and open economy.

36:49.340 --> 36:53.100
 When that happened in him coming in,

36:53.100 --> 36:56.900
 I had some contact with economic policy makers,

36:56.900 --> 36:59.300
 but in the circumstances then,

36:59.300 --> 37:03.820
 where that five major banks lent to state owned enterprises

37:03.820 --> 37:07.780
 and local governments with implied government guarantees.

37:07.780 --> 37:10.060
 And so there was not control of that

37:10.060 --> 37:14.060
 and the movement to aim more of a market economy.

37:14.060 --> 37:17.740
 And the development of markets was a primary

37:17.740 --> 37:20.860
 and also the dealing with the corruption issue.

37:20.860 --> 37:24.100
 There was a lot of corruption prior to that

37:24.100 --> 37:28.460
 and that was viewed as an existential threat to the system.

37:28.460 --> 37:31.580
 So that became the primary objective.

37:31.580 --> 37:36.580
 And then as time progressed over those 10 years,

37:36.580 --> 37:40.420
 there was a lot of changing

37:40.420 --> 37:43.780
 in the world, their financial circumstances,

37:43.780 --> 37:46.900
 opening many, many other markets.

37:46.900 --> 37:48.420
 They particularly getting money

37:48.420 --> 37:51.140
 to small and medium size enterprises

37:51.140 --> 37:52.900
 and developing a lending system

37:52.900 --> 37:55.300
 and then establishing controls on it.

37:55.300 --> 38:00.300
 So right now, there's a vibrant capital markets.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.820
 You can raise capital, you can be an entrepreneur,

38:07.820 --> 38:12.260
 you can become a billionaire in the capital markets

38:12.260 --> 38:13.620
 and they developed the markets

38:13.620 --> 38:16.340
 to be the second largest capital markets.

38:16.340 --> 38:21.340
 At the same time, they had to deal with their rising debt

38:21.340 --> 38:26.340
 issue, which they began to deal with really

38:26.820 --> 38:31.820
 about four years ago when the second term began

38:33.500 --> 38:38.500
 and then Lou Ha became the vice premier

38:41.780 --> 38:46.340
 responsible for that and to deal with those issues.

38:46.340 --> 38:49.900
 So you see right now that what's happening

38:49.900 --> 38:53.140
 is the dealing with the real estate bubble.

38:53.140 --> 38:55.980
 There was a development in real estate, a bubble,

38:55.980 --> 38:59.980
 which produced a lot of unproductive lending.

38:59.980 --> 39:04.980
 And Xi Jinping said, houses are meant to live in

39:06.500 --> 39:09.860
 not to speculate on and so that was wasteful.

39:09.860 --> 39:12.900
 So they established what they call three red lines

39:12.900 --> 39:14.900
 which are financial ratios

39:14.900 --> 39:18.380
 that the property developers had to live within

39:18.380 --> 39:21.820
 and that is then causing the adjustments

39:21.820 --> 39:25.220
 that are going on now, which in my view are very healthy

39:25.220 --> 39:28.980
 because whenever there's bankruptcies

39:28.980 --> 39:33.140
 and so on in the public think, okay, that's a problem.

39:33.140 --> 39:36.300
 It's in many cases really a cleaning up of bad debts

39:36.300 --> 39:40.100
 and bad practices and so that's what's going on.

39:40.100 --> 39:42.620
 So that's, let's say economically.

39:42.620 --> 39:47.620
 At the same time, there is the changing relationships,

39:47.620 --> 39:51.500
 the changing world order, the changing relationships

39:51.500 --> 39:54.140
 with the United States and other countries

39:54.140 --> 39:57.940
 which is becoming much less cooperative

39:57.940 --> 40:01.620
 and much more warlike, much more confrontational.

40:02.660 --> 40:06.780
 Those two things, the domestic debt problem

40:06.780 --> 40:11.140
 and the domestic has led to what's called core,

40:11.140 --> 40:13.140
 what they call core leadership,

40:13.140 --> 40:17.180
 which means a leadership more around him

40:17.180 --> 40:22.180
 that is less challenging because they believe in history

40:23.420 --> 40:26.340
 that during very difficult times,

40:26.340 --> 40:29.860
 a more centrally controlled decision making process

40:29.860 --> 40:32.780
 lends itself better than to a more fragmented

40:32.780 --> 40:35.020
 political contentious project.

40:35.020 --> 40:38.360
 And that's basically what's going on now.

40:39.820 --> 40:42.100
 You said it very eloquently,

40:42.100 --> 40:46.620
 but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men

40:46.620 --> 40:50.140
 and there's a lot of centralized control.

40:50.140 --> 40:55.140
 That characterization is much more black and white

40:55.460 --> 40:56.660
 than it really is.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.380
 But it leans towards that direction.

41:00.380 --> 41:02.300
 Like for example, of the standing members

41:02.300 --> 41:05.140
 of the Politburo, four are more alleged,

41:05.140 --> 41:09.500
 a lot of them, three are less so.

41:09.500 --> 41:12.540
 You have to understand that it's kind of a collective

41:12.540 --> 41:15.580
 leadership at the top and then of course

41:15.580 --> 41:18.580
 there's just jockeying for power

41:18.580 --> 41:22.580
 in a highly political sense at the top.

41:22.580 --> 41:25.980
 But no one leader can be successful

41:25.980 --> 41:30.220
 against all those powers at the top.

41:30.220 --> 41:32.860
 So it's very politically negotiating.

41:32.860 --> 41:37.540
 It's very much more like if you put in the United States

41:37.540 --> 41:39.500
 the Democrats and the Republicans

41:39.500 --> 41:41.340
 and they had to be in the same government

41:41.340 --> 41:45.140
 and they work it out, it's kind of something like that.

41:45.140 --> 41:49.740
 And so that's that struggle, but it's an internal struggle.

41:49.740 --> 41:53.060
 Where do you put the importance of some of these ideas

41:53.060 --> 41:55.300
 at the founding of the United States

41:55.300 --> 41:57.420
 when then, now we're talking about that

41:57.420 --> 42:02.420
 at the context of China, the freedom of speech, freedoms.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.620
 What China is doing with the central management

42:04.620 --> 42:08.540
 of a lot of things, it's enabling a lot of growth,

42:08.540 --> 42:12.900
 but it's also limiting people on the very basic level

42:12.900 --> 42:14.780
 in terms of freedom, the kind of freedom

42:14.780 --> 42:18.500
 that I think can lead to entrepreneurship,

42:18.500 --> 42:20.900
 to starting new businesses, to having big dreams

42:20.900 --> 42:24.180
 and chasing those dreams and then creating totally new things

42:24.180 --> 42:26.780
 in whatever the space, maybe technology

42:26.780 --> 42:29.060
 and in business and whatever.

42:30.420 --> 42:33.460
 How important is that as a metric for society?

42:33.460 --> 42:38.100
 Well, they have a view which is the idea of a dialectic

42:38.100 --> 42:43.100
 which means that everything comes with pros and cons

42:43.100 --> 42:46.540
 and two opposites exist.

42:46.540 --> 42:50.100
 And you want the benefits of those two opposites

42:50.100 --> 42:51.940
 and how do you deal with the benefits

42:51.940 --> 42:54.020
 of those two opposites?

42:54.020 --> 42:57.380
 So let's say you want the capital markets

42:57.380 --> 43:02.060
 because it gets money into the hands of the entrepreneurs

43:02.060 --> 43:04.300
 who are motivated, they build fortunes

43:04.300 --> 43:07.820
 and that drives an economy to do very well.

43:07.820 --> 43:12.740
 And at the same time, it produces the other problems,

43:12.740 --> 43:14.900
 the wealth gaps, the other problems,

43:14.900 --> 43:18.420
 then the debt cycle that we're talking about and so on.

43:18.420 --> 43:23.340
 And Deng Xiaoping, how do you reconcile communism

43:23.340 --> 43:27.540
 and the market economy and the capital markets?

43:27.540 --> 43:32.540
 And he famously said, and it doesn't matter

43:32.660 --> 43:34.380
 if it's a white cat or a black cat,

43:34.380 --> 43:36.340
 just as long as it catches mice.

43:36.340 --> 43:40.620
 In other words, if it works in making the country richer,

43:40.620 --> 43:42.260
 then that becomes the objective

43:42.260 --> 43:43.620
 and then they move that along.

43:43.620 --> 43:48.620
 So there are these conflicts and one of the leaders

43:49.740 --> 43:53.140
 described it to me as follows because it's confusion

43:53.140 --> 43:55.660
 and it goes back over a period of time.

43:55.660 --> 43:58.740
 There's a hierarchy and it's an extension

43:58.740 --> 44:01.300
 of the family he described it.

44:01.300 --> 44:05.260
 And he said, the United States is a country

44:05.260 --> 44:08.280
 of individuals and individualism.

44:08.280 --> 44:13.280
 And that is its vibrancy that we see.

44:15.160 --> 44:17.640
 The individual rights to speak up,

44:17.640 --> 44:22.440
 the individual protection of the individual,

44:22.440 --> 44:25.560
 individual property rights and all of those things

44:25.560 --> 44:28.280
 is of paramount importance.

44:28.280 --> 44:29.920
 And we build our organization.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.080
 That's why democracy is from the bottom up

44:32.080 --> 44:34.240
 or even a company will get together

44:34.240 --> 44:37.480
 and we'll be partners to prosper together.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.440
 That is the American approach.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.360
 He was describing that in China,

44:43.360 --> 44:47.840
 it's an extension of the Confucian family, essentially.

44:47.840 --> 44:52.360
 And so it's almost like there's a hierarchy.

44:52.360 --> 44:57.040
 And so what they think about is the common good,

44:57.040 --> 44:59.400
 not the individualism.

44:59.400 --> 45:02.080
 So for example, if they want a high speed rail

45:02.080 --> 45:04.120
 to go from one place to another

45:04.120 --> 45:06.720
 and that's best in the common good,

45:06.720 --> 45:08.840
 then the individual protections

45:08.840 --> 45:11.320
 that would stand in the way of doing that

45:11.320 --> 45:13.680
 would be of secondary concern.

45:13.680 --> 45:17.240
 So that notion of controlling.

45:17.240 --> 45:22.240
 So for example, what they're doing with video games,

45:24.200 --> 45:28.240
 they control what type of video games

45:28.240 --> 45:32.740
 and how many hours a day kids can be on video games

45:33.920 --> 45:35.680
 operating in that way.

45:35.680 --> 45:39.000
 Because they believe that that's good for the society

45:39.000 --> 45:40.800
 and that's very controlling.

45:40.800 --> 45:43.840
 In the United States, I think probably most parents

45:43.840 --> 45:45.120
 would say leave it to me

45:45.120 --> 45:48.320
 and it's a matter between me and my kids.

45:48.320 --> 45:50.640
 The same thing has to do with data.

45:50.640 --> 45:55.200
 In other words, in the United States, who controls the data?

45:55.200 --> 45:57.360
 Does the company control the data?

45:57.360 --> 46:00.000
 Do you individually control the data?

46:00.000 --> 46:03.600
 And so the inclination would be to figure that out

46:03.600 --> 46:05.640
 but nobody would say that the government

46:05.640 --> 46:07.440
 is going to control the data

46:07.440 --> 46:11.800
 because of our inclination of really anti government control.

46:11.800 --> 46:14.200
 In China, it would be that the government

46:14.200 --> 46:15.880
 will control the data

46:15.880 --> 46:18.880
 because that's going to be best for the society

46:18.880 --> 46:20.360
 and it depends who you trust.

46:20.360 --> 46:24.720
 But that's, so that difference in philosophy

46:24.720 --> 46:28.640
 is very much at the heart of that.

46:28.640 --> 46:33.120
 As far as your question in terms of effectiveness,

46:33.120 --> 46:35.920
 it really is, in China's case,

46:35.920 --> 46:38.120
 it's how you balance the things, right?

46:38.120 --> 46:41.200
 So what they're attempting to do is to create

46:41.200 --> 46:43.680
 a lot of freedom and creativity

46:44.680 --> 46:48.520
 in areas that are not political, let's say.

46:50.320 --> 46:53.840
 And so you see a lot of entrepreneurship,

46:53.840 --> 46:55.960
 you see a lot of product development,

46:55.960 --> 47:00.640
 you see a lot of creativity happening in that way.

47:00.640 --> 47:04.880
 So the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening

47:04.880 --> 47:06.720
 is an old stereotype.

47:06.720 --> 47:09.320
 Whereas a lot of creativity is certainly happening

47:09.320 --> 47:10.880
 and the system can work well

47:10.880 --> 47:13.240
 if they can achieve that kind of balance.

47:13.240 --> 47:15.040
 It's proven to work well.

47:15.040 --> 47:18.280
 Since I started going there in 1984,

47:18.280 --> 47:21.080
 per capita income, real per capita income

47:21.080 --> 47:24.160
 is increased by 26 times.

47:24.160 --> 47:28.920
 The longevity rate is increased by 10 years.

47:28.920 --> 47:33.240
 The poverty rate has fallen from 88% to less than 1%

47:33.240 --> 47:37.360
 in terms of basics like starvation and things.

47:37.360 --> 47:41.720
 And if you read history, Plato's Republic,

47:41.720 --> 47:46.360
 he talks about the cycles, democracy and autocratic

47:46.360 --> 47:49.200
 and the benevolent despot and all of that.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.320
 Each has their own vulnerability.

47:53.320 --> 47:55.680
 The vulnerability of democracy,

47:55.680 --> 47:58.800
 which has been a remarkable, remarkable system.

47:58.800 --> 48:02.040
 And I don't have to extol the benefits of it.

48:02.960 --> 48:07.960
 But the vulnerability of it has always been

48:07.960 --> 48:12.960
 the internal conflict that produces itself as anarchy.

48:13.880 --> 48:18.640
 In World War II, four democracies

48:18.640 --> 48:21.960
 chose to be autocracies

48:21.960 --> 48:25.960
 because there was internal disorder

48:25.960 --> 48:30.160
 and the belief will somebody bring about order

48:30.160 --> 48:32.640
 and get control of the situation.

48:32.640 --> 48:37.640
 That was in Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.120
 There were parliamentary systems

48:41.120 --> 48:43.800
 that turned themselves over to that.

48:43.800 --> 48:48.800
 So both systems have vulnerabilities.

48:48.800 --> 48:53.240
 I think the main thing that we need to think about

48:53.240 --> 48:54.760
 is those vulnerabilities.

48:54.760 --> 48:58.280
 Democracy is an amazing system

48:58.280 --> 49:03.280
 because the adherence to the rules and the system

49:03.440 --> 49:06.800
 and the checks and balances is quite amazing.

49:06.800 --> 49:10.440
 And it gives it a flexibility to change without civil wars.

49:12.400 --> 49:15.000
 But there has to be the respect of the rules.

49:15.000 --> 49:20.000
 And when you see something like they will not accept elections

49:22.440 --> 49:24.560
 or they will not accept rules,

49:25.600 --> 49:29.640
 history has shown when the causes that people are behind

49:29.640 --> 49:32.320
 are more important to them than the system.

49:32.320 --> 49:34.400
 The system is in jeopardy.

49:34.400 --> 49:38.240
 So we have a situation that's very much like that

49:38.240 --> 49:42.480
 in terms of let's say the 2024 elections.

49:42.480 --> 49:46.720
 I believe that there's a very high chance

49:46.720 --> 49:51.720
 that neither side will accept losing, for example.

49:51.800 --> 49:56.240
 And so we have that kind of a situation.

49:56.240 --> 50:01.240
 So one would hope that one could rise above the disagreements

50:01.760 --> 50:06.760
 and rely on the system for resolving disagreements

50:06.760 --> 50:12.840
 because if that doesn't happen, then we have our own chaos.

50:12.840 --> 50:16.240
 So the kind of the trend that started in 2020,

50:16.240 --> 50:21.240
 or I mean, I suppose it's been there, it's been growing.

50:21.960 --> 50:24.160
 One representation of this internal disorder

50:24.160 --> 50:27.360
 has been the growing trend of being skeptical

50:27.360 --> 50:29.640
 about the results of the election.

50:29.640 --> 50:31.600
 Well, it started before that.

50:31.600 --> 50:35.040
 There was the emergence of population

50:35.040 --> 50:39.160
 before President Trump was elected.

50:39.960 --> 50:43.280
 He was basically elected as a populist

50:43.280 --> 50:46.800
 because there was a large percentage of the population

50:46.800 --> 50:50.640
 that felt that the system didn't work for them.

50:50.640 --> 50:52.600
 And he tapped into that.

50:52.600 --> 50:56.040
 And he was largely elected as a populist leader,

50:56.040 --> 50:59.400
 first populist leader in a developed country.

51:00.560 --> 51:04.200
 And so populism began that then.

51:04.200 --> 51:08.400
 And that was a battle of one group against the other group.

51:08.400 --> 51:11.680
 And so since then, it's been like that

51:11.680 --> 51:13.600
 and it continued to grow.

51:17.920 --> 51:22.920
 You've mentioned the vulnerability of democracy,

51:23.000 --> 51:26.600
 the internal disorder is the vulnerability of democracy.

51:26.600 --> 51:29.480
 What's the vulnerability of a system like China?

51:29.480 --> 51:32.440
 Maybe one way to say is put China aside

51:32.440 --> 51:34.960
 and look at history, look at Soviet Union.

51:34.960 --> 51:39.840
 What's the vulnerability of a communist type system?

51:39.840 --> 51:44.840
 Well, I'll call it both communist and autocratic,

51:46.480 --> 51:48.920
 depending on how much autocracy,

51:48.920 --> 51:52.480
 is that it lacks flexibility.

51:52.480 --> 51:56.520
 It lacks the ability,

51:56.520 --> 51:59.520
 but I should deal with them differently.

51:59.520 --> 52:02.120
 In other words, there's the economic system.

52:02.120 --> 52:07.120
 The economic system threatens motivation and productivity.

52:07.240 --> 52:12.240
 So communism or socialism has to be done in a way

52:12.560 --> 52:17.000
 where you can threaten productivity.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.480
 Capitalism has, and what I mean by that,

52:20.480 --> 52:24.680
 I mean free markets and capital markets

52:24.680 --> 52:28.440
 have been an effective way of allocating resources

52:28.440 --> 52:33.440
 and also creating the incentives and the resources,

52:33.560 --> 52:37.560
 providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas.

52:37.560 --> 52:40.600
 And so if I compare that,

52:40.600 --> 52:43.520
 what the Chinese have done to a large extent

52:43.520 --> 52:47.160
 is to recognize that and have made a move.

52:47.160 --> 52:52.080
 That's why the seeming dialectic or the conflict

52:52.080 --> 52:53.680
 between those two things exist.

52:53.680 --> 52:58.680
 But anyway, that's it, as far as an autocratic system,

52:58.800 --> 53:03.800
 rather than one man, one vote from the population up.

53:04.280 --> 53:07.320
 The risks of the autocratic system

53:07.320 --> 53:11.280
 is that there's enough discontent that arises

53:12.240 --> 53:16.560
 that the system doesn't have the flexibility

53:16.560 --> 53:20.520
 and that rather than bending, it breaks.

53:20.520 --> 53:24.160
 That's the big risk.

53:24.160 --> 53:28.240
 The notion of trying to control a population

53:28.240 --> 53:31.400
 if there's that rather than giving it the flexibility.

53:32.400 --> 53:36.160
 So that would be the big risk of the autocratic system.

53:36.160 --> 53:37.200
 What's the human,

53:38.760 --> 53:40.400
 because you mentioned like the top gets bigger

53:40.400 --> 53:44.760
 with the empires and you start to get things for granted.

53:45.760 --> 53:48.320
 Is some of this just human nature?

53:48.320 --> 53:53.320
 So the concern with China, with the autocratic nations,

53:53.400 --> 53:58.400
 the concern with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union,

53:59.920 --> 54:03.560
 was that fundamentally at the individual level,

54:03.560 --> 54:06.440
 the humans involved at the top,

54:06.440 --> 54:07.720
 they start becoming,

54:07.720 --> 54:11.160
 they're starting to lose touch with the reality

54:11.160 --> 54:13.440
 in a way that no longer makes them.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.880
 I guess that's the representation

54:14.880 --> 54:16.960
 of the flexibility that you're referring to.

54:16.960 --> 54:21.200
 Well, I mean, in a democracy, you could change.

54:21.200 --> 54:23.560
 You can go as far left or as far right.

54:23.560 --> 54:25.800
 You can change the leaders easily.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.720
 And so the people don't become,

54:28.920 --> 54:31.160
 they pretty much only have themselves to blame.

54:32.840 --> 54:35.680
 And one of the problems of that

54:35.680 --> 54:37.960
 is they may not choose the best leaders,

54:39.320 --> 54:42.360
 but they have that flexibility.

54:42.360 --> 54:46.200
 So vote and you get what you wanted.

54:46.200 --> 54:49.040
 In the case of the autocratic, let's say leaders,

54:49.040 --> 54:53.080
 and then the movement from democracies to autocracies,

54:54.040 --> 54:57.440
 what you see normally that movement

54:57.440 --> 55:00.560
 is that one of the systems is not working.

55:00.560 --> 55:02.960
 Let's say the democracy is not effectively.

55:02.960 --> 55:04.480
 Everybody's arguing with each other

55:04.480 --> 55:05.920
 and nobody's getting anything done.

55:05.920 --> 55:10.320
 And like Mussolini, the trains are not running on time.

55:10.320 --> 55:12.240
 And that would be the example.

55:12.240 --> 55:14.560
 Geez, this place has gotten chaotic.

55:14.560 --> 55:16.640
 Well, somebody get to control.

55:16.640 --> 55:20.480
 And then you get the autocratic,

55:20.480 --> 55:24.680
 and then he's autocratic enough to boss people around.

55:24.680 --> 55:29.000
 And then you follow those kinds of orders.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.640
 And it's like maybe a CEO in a powerful company

55:32.640 --> 55:34.560
 ordering around and that could work well

55:34.560 --> 55:36.040
 or it could work badly.

55:36.040 --> 55:40.040
 You know, most companies are run

55:40.040 --> 55:43.840
 as like autocracies in a sense.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.960
 You know, there's the hierarchy and the command economy

55:46.960 --> 55:48.600
 and that kind of thing.

55:49.560 --> 55:53.640
 And that can work well or not,

55:53.640 --> 55:58.640
 but then quite often when you get the populist autocratic,

55:58.760 --> 56:02.280
 their personality is something that they wanna fight

56:03.360 --> 56:05.760
 and they become more nationalistic

56:06.960 --> 56:09.840
 and they tend to become more militaristic.

56:09.840 --> 56:12.520
 And human nature at that stage

56:12.520 --> 56:15.160
 lends itself to fighting.

56:15.160 --> 56:19.920
 There's an arc here that when we think of a country

56:20.920 --> 56:23.680
 and we say we and we think of a country,

56:24.560 --> 56:26.680
 it's not true, it's not like that.

56:26.680 --> 56:29.000
 There are individuals who change.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
 One generation dies and another generation comes along.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.960
 And one of those arcs is that the ones

56:37.960 --> 56:41.600
 who have been through war don't wanna go to war

56:41.600 --> 56:46.240
 and are more happily willing to abide by

56:46.240 --> 56:47.920
 whatever the rules are.

56:47.920 --> 56:50.880
 As you get farther along into that cycle

56:50.880 --> 56:52.400
 and you get a new generation

56:52.400 --> 56:55.400
 and they forget about wars and the horrors of wars,

56:55.400 --> 56:59.560
 then they want to fight.

56:59.560 --> 57:04.560
 And so you're seeing right now the emergent of fight for right.

57:04.800 --> 57:08.920
 And what that means is you see it internally,

57:08.920 --> 57:13.160
 fight, where are you in fight for that thing?

57:13.160 --> 57:14.840
 And they mean fight.

57:14.840 --> 57:17.560
 And then into externally, fight,

57:17.560 --> 57:21.800
 are you going to be the strong one who will fight and win?

57:21.800 --> 57:26.000
 And that develops on both sides, this fight and win.

57:26.000 --> 57:30.240
 And each side is cheering each other on into a war.

57:30.240 --> 57:34.680
 But that comes by those who really have not experienced war

57:34.680 --> 57:37.560
 because it comes in their part of their lifetime.

57:37.560 --> 57:39.440
 Humans are fascinating.

57:39.440 --> 57:40.760
 Humans are fascinating.

57:40.760 --> 57:44.440
 And by the way, human nature has not changed

57:44.440 --> 57:47.240
 over the thousands of years.

57:47.240 --> 57:49.000
 So it's so interesting,

57:49.000 --> 57:50.840
 because like in doing this study,

57:50.840 --> 57:53.040
 and it comes across in the study,

57:53.040 --> 57:55.840
 it's like watching the same movie over and over again.

57:57.040 --> 58:01.240
 You see the arc and you see it happen over and over again.

58:01.240 --> 58:03.560
 The only things that seem to change

58:03.560 --> 58:06.160
 are the clothes people wear and the technologies.

58:06.160 --> 58:09.160
 Yeah, and then somebody probably will disagree with you

58:09.160 --> 58:10.000
 about the clothes.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.160
 Maybe there's also cycles within fashions.

58:12.160 --> 58:14.160
 Maybe we're not even creative there.

58:14.160 --> 58:20.160
 What do you make of Russia and Vladimir Putin?

58:20.160 --> 58:22.160
 What do you think about Putin as a leader,

58:22.160 --> 58:24.160
 as a human being on this world stage,

58:24.160 --> 58:28.160
 within the context of the cycles of empires

58:28.160 --> 58:30.160
 that you think about?

58:30.160 --> 58:32.160
 Well, Putin came to power

58:32.160 --> 58:37.160
 at the failure of Russia's last order.

58:37.160 --> 58:40.160
 So there was the end of communism.

58:41.160 --> 58:44.160
 And there was the development of the market economy,

58:44.160 --> 58:46.160
 the collapse of the Soviet Union.

58:48.160 --> 58:50.160
 And at that time,

58:50.160 --> 58:54.160
 he was appointed by Yeltsin,

58:54.160 --> 58:58.160
 who was an alcoholic and had problems,

58:58.160 --> 59:02.160
 managing and was put into power.

59:02.160 --> 59:05.160
 And the conditions in the Russian were,

59:05.160 --> 59:07.160
 there was anarchy.

59:07.160 --> 59:09.160
 There was no money.

59:09.160 --> 59:12.160
 It had the classic end of cycle ingredients.

59:12.160 --> 59:13.160
 It was broke.

59:13.160 --> 59:15.160
 It was three people fighting with each other.

59:15.160 --> 59:17.160
 It was in the anarchy.

59:17.160 --> 59:20.160
 And that's when he came to power.

59:20.160 --> 59:24.160
 And there were not institutions,

59:24.160 --> 59:25.160
 the whole thing,

59:25.160 --> 59:28.160
 and collapsed.

59:28.160 --> 59:31.160
 And it was not effective ministry of education,

59:31.160 --> 59:33.160
 ministry of anything.

59:33.160 --> 59:37.160
 And so the idea was that

59:37.160 --> 59:40.160
 they needed 25 years of stability

59:40.160 --> 59:43.160
 and they needed a democracy

59:43.160 --> 59:47.160
 and they needed the improvement of capital markets.

59:47.160 --> 59:50.160
 So he's been in that position

59:50.160 --> 59:52.160
 as a,

59:52.160 --> 59:56.160
 as I guess I would call him,

59:56.160 --> 1:00:00.160
 a semi autocratic leader in that,

1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:03.160
 from all indications,

1:00:03.160 --> 1:00:06.160
 he would respect the democracy.

1:00:06.160 --> 1:00:08.160
 And he's very popular.

1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:10.160
 He's won democratic elections

1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:12.160
 because he's been a strong leader

1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:16.160
 and he's brought peace and stability

1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:21.160
 to Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:25.160
 And he's a strong leader

1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:31.160
 in pursuit of the country's interests

1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:37.160
 in a way where Russia is not

1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:40.160
 a significant economic power,

1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:44.160
 but it is a significant military power.

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:47.160
 So the issues,

1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:49.160
 and then there's a strong alliance

1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:52.160
 between Russia and China now.

1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:56.160
 So that's kind of the lay of the land.

1:00:56.160 --> 1:00:59.160
 And then there are sensitivities.

1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:03.160
 The Ukraine issue is a sensitivity

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:07.160
 because there are a lot of Russians

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:09.160
 who live in the Ukraine

1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:13.160
 and there's also the issue of NATO on their border.

1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:15.160
 So there are those kinds of things

1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:17.160
 and he has military power

1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:21.160
 and he has a strong alliance with China.

1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:24.160
 And I guess that's my best summary

1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:27.160
 of what his position is.

1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:32.160
 Strong leader, popular.

1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:35.160
 These are not subjective interpretations.

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:38.160
 These are objective interpretations.

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:41.160
 Yeah, it's interesting just in this conversation.

1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:46.160
 You're not sort of doing the usual criticism

1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:48.160
 in any one particular system.

1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:50.160
 You're looking at these systems

1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:52.160
 from the perspective of history.

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:54.160
 You're just describing how they work.

1:01:54.160 --> 1:01:56.160
 It's often times when you talk about

1:01:56.160 --> 1:01:58.160
 what Russia is today

1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:00.160
 or what Soviet Union was

1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:02.160
 or what China is today,

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:04.160
 is you start to criticize

1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:06.160
 while they do this kind of censorship

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:08.160
 or they do this kind of,

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:10.160
 they limit freedoms in this kind of way.

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:12.160
 But you're just kind of describing this

1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:14.160
 as a nation with ideas

1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:16.160
 to get it to work.

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.160
 This is why it's working.

1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:20.160
 This is what's not working.

1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:22.160
 Here's metrics that show that it's not working.

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:24.160
 I think that's a refreshing way to think about it.

1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:26.160
 It's easy though.

1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:28.160
 You got some criticism

1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:32.160
 saying that I think China is a strict parent.

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:34.160
 Some people criticize these countries

1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:38.160
 for violating human rights.

1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:40.160
 I suppose there are some people

1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:42.160
 that criticize the United States

1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:44.160
 for violating human rights.

1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:46.160
 But what are your thoughts

1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:50.160
 on the world stage today

1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:52.160
 about some of the

1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:54.160
 behaviors it has governed

1:02:54.160 --> 1:02:56.160
 in terms of respecting the rights,

1:02:56.160 --> 1:02:58.160
 the basic rights of human beings?

1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:00.160
 You described accurately

1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:02.160
 how I just tried to

1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:04.160
 look at things in a non...

1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:06.160
 I don't want to impute

1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:08.160
 my values

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:10.160
 on anybody

1:03:10.160 --> 1:03:12.160
 but I mean

1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:14.160
 there are intolerable things

1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:16.160
 so I'm not saying there aren't

1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:18.160
 intolerable things.

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:20.160
 But one of the great things

1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:22.160
 of being an American here

1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:24.160
 is that I grew up with

1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:26.160
 all different nationalities

1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:28.160
 having all different points of view

1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:30.160
 and all different religions

1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:32.160
 and all different ways of operating.

1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:34.160
 And I've come to treasure

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:36.160
 the fact that

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:38.160
 what's their business

1:03:38.160 --> 1:03:40.160
 and then the question is

1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:42.160
 where do you cross the line

1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:44.160
 under what circumstances

1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:46.160
 that others have got to do it my way

1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:48.160
 and then when you do it

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:50.160
 internationally

1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:52.160
 the issue of what is a sovereign state

1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:54.160
 which

1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:56.160
 as I say in the piece of Westphalia

1:03:56.160 --> 1:03:58.160
 and you have borders

1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:00.160
 and then when do you cross the line

1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:02.160
 that

1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:04.160
 my way of doing things

1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:06.160
 has got to be their way of doing things

1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:08.160
 and so that's a very

1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:10.160
 delicate question

1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:12.160
 or a very difficult question

1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:14.160
 and we all have responsibilities

1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:16.160
 to different parties

1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:18.160
 and we all have different levels of knowledge

1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:20.160
 about those particular things.

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:22.160
 So

1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:24.160
 for example

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:26.160
 as an international investor

1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:28.160
 I have a responsibility to my investors

1:04:28.160 --> 1:04:30.160
 those who run companies

1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:32.160
 have a responsibility

1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:34.160
 to theirs of how do they run that

1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:36.160
 so if you're taking

1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:38.160
 Nike

1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:40.160
 or sneakers and so on

1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:42.160
 and Americans can decide

1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:44.160
 whether they want to buy Chinese products

1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:46.160
 or not buy Chinese products

1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:48.160
 we are all faced with those types of choices.

1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:50.160
 So you have

1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:52.160
 what do you want to do in your constituency

1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:54.160
 and you have your choices

1:04:54.160 --> 1:04:56.160
 and then beyond that

1:04:56.160 --> 1:04:58.160
 in many cases the issues are quite complex

1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:00.160
 like there are geopolitical

1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:02.160
 questions that enter into it

1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:04.160
 so

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:06.160
 and then I believe that

1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:08.160
 if you

1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:10.160
 disconnected

1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:12.160
 if all those

1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:14.160
 if entities like myself

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:16.160
 the businesses

1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:18.160
 doing business with China disconnected

1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:20.160
 I think that that would be

1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:22.160
 disastrous economically disastrous

1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:24.160
 and it would also be

1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:26.160
 reduce

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:28.160
 the understanding

1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:30.160
 that comes from working together

1:05:30.160 --> 1:05:32.160
 to reduce wars

1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:34.160
 and so these are all complicated

1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:36.160
 so what we do

1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:38.160
 is

1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:40.160
 and who makes it my opinion matters the most

1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:42.160
 why should it be my opinion that matters

1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:44.160
 the most in making that decision

1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:46.160
 so I largely look at

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:48.160
 the government guidance that I get

1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:50.160
 not only from my own government

1:05:50.160 --> 1:05:52.160
 but from the other governments and I follow the rules

1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:54.160
 I'm in 40

1:05:54.160 --> 1:05:56.160
 we invest in 40 countries

1:05:56.160 --> 1:05:58.160
 and we want to do that in the best way

1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:00.160
 the diversified portfolio

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:02.160
 and we sort of need that

1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:04.160
 every one of those countries has

1:06:04.160 --> 1:06:06.160
 similar complexities

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:08.160
 there are always one issue

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:10.160
 or another and there's only so much

1:06:10.160 --> 1:06:12.160
 that we really understand

1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:14.160
 about all of those issues so we rely

1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:16.160
 largely on the guidance that we get

1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:18.160
 yeah you have to empathize

1:06:18.160 --> 1:06:20.160
 and show respect to the culture

1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:22.160
 of the place the way things are done

1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:24.160
 you don't necessarily

1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:26.160
 the way you heal

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:28.160
 relationships between nations

1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:30.160
 like you said

1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:32.160
 you work together

1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:34.160
 and that requires

1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:36.160
 kind of

1:06:36.160 --> 1:06:38.160
 to listen

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:40.160
 maybe more than you talk

1:06:40.160 --> 1:06:42.160
 and I think people in the public sphere

1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:44.160
 talk a lot

1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:46.160
 about China without really listening

1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:48.160
 without understanding much about China

1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:50.160
 one of the things that makes me really sad

1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:52.160
 because I know how to speak Russian

1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:54.160
 and I

1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:56.160
 know how much is lost in translation

1:06:56.160 --> 1:06:58.160
 it makes me sad

1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:00.160
 that I'll never really get to know

1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:02.160
 the Chinese culture because

1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:04.160
 like I'll never really get to know the language

1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:06.160
 the literature

1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:08.160
 just talk to regular people

1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:10.160
 it's not just the government or officials

1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:12.160
 or scientists just regular folks

1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:14.160
 and get the culture

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:16.160
 I think if you don't understand the culture

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:18.160
 just the basics of the human nature

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:20.160
 what people

1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:22.160
 love about their country

1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:24.160
 about their family

1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:26.160
 what kind of hopes they have

1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:28.160
 what kind of values they have without that

1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:30.160
 you're not going to be able to

1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:32.160
 fully

1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:34.160
 connect with them

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:36.160
 and you have to do that first

1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:38.160
 to have a chance of building a good world

1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:40.160
 I couldn't agree with you more

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:42.160
 I was very lucky because

1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:44.160
 as I say

1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:46.160
 since 1984

1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:48.160
 so for more than half of my life

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:50.160
 I've been going there and I

1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:52.160
 and the common people

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:54.160
 and all sorts of people

1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:56.160
 and I've got to meet them

1:07:56.160 --> 1:07:58.160
 I don't speak the language

1:07:58.160 --> 1:08:00.160
 but

1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:02.160
 a combination of through translators

1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:04.160
 or them speaking English

1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:06.160
 and being in situations

1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:08.160
 I had my son go to school

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:10.160
 a local school

1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:12.160
 and we developed those kinds of

1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:14.160
 understandings

1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:16.160
 I think that

1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:18.160
 to know the other

1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:20.160
 perspective

1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:22.160
 is the thing that's most scary

1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:24.160
 like I'm right now in the middle

1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:26.160
 and

1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:28.160
 all I want to try to do

1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:30.160
 is to help

1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:32.160
 a mutual understanding

1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:34.160
 you're right if there were questions

1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:36.160
 probing me, asking me

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:38.160
 what is it? I'm not on one side

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:40.160
 or another

1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:42.160
 I don't want to be on one side or another

1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:44.160
 I believe that each has their right

1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:46.160
 in there to approach their different culture

1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:48.160
 in their own way

1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:50.160
 so many ways you gave an example

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:52.160
 if they're not

1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:54.160
 doing harm to others

1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:56.160
 but that issue

1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:58.160
 of

1:08:58.160 --> 1:09:00.160
 trying to understand

1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:02.160
 is

1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:04.160
 so much better

1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:06.160
 that doesn't mean agree with

1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:08.160
 if you are

1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:10.160
 wanting to

1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:12.160
 out clever and out compete somebody

1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:14.160
 it still pays to

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:16.160
 understand what they're thinking

1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:18.160
 so to achieve

1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:20.160
 understanding of what they're thinking

1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:22.160
 even if you want to go to war with them

1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:24.160
 that understanding is the best thing to have

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.160
 what we have now

1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:28.160
 is a situation

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:30.160
 in which there's an enemy

1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:32.160
 mentality and that means

1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:34.160
 that anything

1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:36.160
 that seems to be

1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:38.160
 like understanding

1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:40.160
 or conveying understanding

1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:42.160
 needs to mistakenly create the notion

1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:44.160
 of

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:46.160
 I'm on their side in a war

1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:48.160
 and that's kind of a dangerous thing

1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:50.160
 because

1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:52.160
 there's a momentum here to fight

1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:54.160
 Henry Kissinger praises your new book

1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:56.160
 and you thank him in it

1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:58.160
 in the dedication

1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:00.160
 what's your relationship like with him

1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:02.160
 what makes him interesting

1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:04.160
 maybe what makes him controversial

1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:06.160
 what makes him such a central figure in history

1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:08.160
 first, most importantly

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:10.160
 he's unique about seeing things

1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:12.160
 through all

1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:14.160
 the others eyes

1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:16.160
 so if you were

1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:18.160
 it's like there's a chess game

1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:20.160
 I mean I think geopolitics

1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:22.160
 is like

1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:24.160
 a chess game but with multiple chess players

1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:26.160
 playing the same game

1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:28.160
 so imagine there are

1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:30.160
 six people around

1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:32.160
 playing the chess game

1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:34.160
 and he could sit in each seat

1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:36.160
 and he could know how

1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:38.160
 they see it

1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:40.160
 and see it in a calm

1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:42.160
 way of how they see it

1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:44.160
 he's unique in that way

1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:46.160
 he's 98 years old

1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:48.160
 and he's equally able to do that

1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:50.160
 and he has a background

1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:52.160
 in which he's a historian

1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:54.160
 so he really understands

1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:56.160
 history super

1:10:56.160 --> 1:10:58.160
 terrifically

1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:00.160
 he doesn't understand

1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:02.160
 economic history as much

1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:04.160
 so that's why to some extent we enjoy

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:06.160
 having a conversation

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:08.160
 because he's interested in the

1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:10.160
 economic piece he doesn't know

1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:12.160
 and I'm so interested in the

1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:14.160
 geopolitical piece that I don't know as well

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:16.160
 but anyway he's able to do that

1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:18.160
 but not only a historian

1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:20.160
 but a practitioner

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:22.160
 so when you go from

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:24.160
 an academic

1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:26.160
 to a practitioner

1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:28.160
 who has that talent

1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:30.160
 to see things through

1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:32.160
 others eyes in an objective way

1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:34.160
 and to be strategic

1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:36.160
 rather than just tactical

1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:38.160
 that's a very special person

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:40.160
 and that's why Henry is

1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:42.160
 to me a very special person

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:44.160
 yeah he's lived a fascinating life

1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:46.160
 just all of the

1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:48.160
 world events he's been involved in

1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:50.160
 is fascinating

1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:52.160
 and like you said that's such

1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:54.160
 an interesting skill to have

1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:56.160
 to consider what are the concerns

1:11:56.160 --> 1:11:58.160
 the hope, the dreams, the fears

1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:00.160
 of all the people at the table

1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:02.160
 thinking

1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:04.160
 I find that people don't

1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:06.160
 once again don't do that enough

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:08.160
 when it's the obvious thing you should be doing

1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:10.160
 whether it's business deals

1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:12.160
 or

1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:14.160
 political negotiation

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:16.160
 or geopolitical negotiation

1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:18.160
 I'm often surprised again sorry to go to the Russian

1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:20.160
 thing because I hear

1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:22.160
 sort of like

1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:24.160
 I hear Putin talk in Russian

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:26.160
 and you start to infer certain intentions

1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:28.160
 like not the trivial stuff

1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:30.160
 like the human being

1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:32.160
 what is that human being hoping

1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:34.160
 for himself, for his country

1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:36.160
 for his close in a circle

1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:38.160
 for the bigger

1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:40.160
 and I just see that that's often

1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:42.160
 just lost in translation

1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:44.160
 I just see like American leaders

1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:46.160
 talking to Putin

1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:48.160
 and it's just not

1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:50.160
 there's not a connection

1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:52.160
 absolutely I know exactly what you're talking about

1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:54.160
 you

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:56.160
 it has never failed

1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:58.160
 am I listening to a conversation

1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:00.160
 or even reading a speech

1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:02.160
 or

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:04.160
 and you see then it reported

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:06.160
 the

1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:08.160
 inevitably the reporter

1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:10.160
 picks some

1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:12.160
 headline characterization

1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:14.160
 that has very little to do

1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:16.160
 with what was really happening

1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:18.160
 but might be a headline grabber

1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:20.160
 that's at some kind of distortion

1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:22.160
 and there's a lack of understanding

1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:24.160
 of really what's going on

1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:26.160
 if it's okay let me ask you

1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:28.160
 a couple questions about cryptocurrency

1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:30.160
 you've had a few opinions

1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:32.160
 about bitcoin over the years

1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:34.160
 what are your thoughts about bitcoin today

1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:36.160
 its role

1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:38.160
 in the global financial system

1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:40.160
 and just in human society in general

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:42.160
 well the evolution

1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:44.160
 of bitcoin over the years

1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:46.160
 is one of the things that

1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:48.160
 has

1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:50.160
 influence changes in my view

1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:52.160
 it

1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:54.160
 has proven itself

1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:56.160
 something like

1:13:56.160 --> 1:13:58.160
 10 11 years ago imagine

1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:00.160
 the programming of this

1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:02.160
 and here's you throw it out and that's the idea

1:14:02.160 --> 1:14:04.160
 it has not been hacked

1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:06.160
 it has

1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:08.160
 operated

1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:10.160
 it is built it has come

1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:12.160
 an amazing way

1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:14.160
 over that 11 years

1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:16.160
 to be

1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:18.160
 maybe probably the most excited

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:20.160
 topic among

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:22.160
 a lot of people

1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:24.160
 and has been used and

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:26.160
 has now

1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:28.160
 obtained the status

1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:30.160
 of having imputed value

1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:32.160
 at the same time

1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:34.160
 it is one of those

1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:36.160
 assets that is an alternative

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:38.160
 money I think we're

1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:40.160
 entering an era

1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:42.160
 where there's going to be

1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:44.160
 a competition of monies

1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:46.160
 because

1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:48.160
 of the printing of fiat money

1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:50.160
 and

1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:52.160
 the depreciated value

1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:54.160
 there will be a competition

1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:56.160
 of monies

1:14:56.160 --> 1:14:58.160
 and bitcoin is part

1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:00.160
 of that competition but there will be

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:02.160
 many monies not just crypto monies

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:04.160
 but there will be central

1:15:04.160 --> 1:15:06.160
 bank crypto monies

1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:08.160
 but there will be different

1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:10.160
 kinds of monies

1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:12.160
 and even monies

1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:14.160
 are things that you buy and sell

1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:16.160
 NFTs can become

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:18.160
 a money

1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:20.160
 a type of money you own it

1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:22.160
 and it's an investment and you could say I'd rather own it

1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:24.160
 than own bitcoin

1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:26.160
 has Ray Dalio bought any NFTs?

1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:28.160
 not yet

1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:30.160
 but

1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:32.160
 only just because

1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:34.160
 I definitely want to buy

1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:36.160
 NFTs to just experience them

1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:38.160
 I think I should

1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:40.160
 produce one

1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:42.160
 I should have asked that

1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:44.160
 have you minted an NFT

1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:46.160
 just to know what it's like?

1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:48.160
 this stuff is happening

1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:50.160
 this stuff is real

1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:52.160
 and how it operates

1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:54.160
 but like all new real

1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:56.160
 things

1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:58.160
 some are going to go

1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:00.160
 it's like in the internet

1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:02.160
 in the year 2000

1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:04.160
 Pets.com

1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:06.160
 could have been a great but maybe

1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:08.160
 Pets.com doesn't make it and who knows

1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:10.160
 that's the beauty of the competitive system

1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:12.160
 that it will evolve

1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:14.160
 some things will be treasured

1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:16.160
 and some things will be trashed

1:16:16.160 --> 1:16:18.160
 so

1:16:18.160 --> 1:16:20.160
 but when I look at it

1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:22.160
 I think we are in an environment

1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:24.160
 of what is an alternative money

1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:26.160
 a money has two purposes

1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:28.160
 a medium of exchange

1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:30.160
 and a storehold of wealth

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:32.160
 and we are looking for

1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:34.160
 and it's portable

1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:36.160
 and it's best

1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:38.160
 if it's recognized in other countries

1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:40.160
 so

1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:42.160
 gold is one of those

1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:44.160
 so I look at it

1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:46.160
 as an alternative gold

1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:48.160
 but I look at a number of things

1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:50.160
 as an alternative gold

1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:52.160
 and I think that

1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:54.160
 and gold is still my favorite

1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:56.160
 because

1:16:56.160 --> 1:16:58.160
 of certain qualities for example

1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:00.160
 you can't trace it

1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:02.160
 in bitcoin you can trace

1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:04.160
 who owns it where it's going

1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:06.160
 and so on governments can have that ability

1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:08.160
 to trace it and so on

1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:10.160
 but if it's a piece of coin

1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:12.160
 it's not connected

1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:14.160
 I think not connected has benefits

1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:16.160
 particularly in a world where

1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:18.160
 maybe connections can be more risky

1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:20.160
 so

1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:22.160
 and then also gold

1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:24.160
 has been

1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:26.160
 for many thousands of years

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:28.160
 universally recognized as a source of money

1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:30.160
 and central banks

1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:32.160
 it's the third largest

1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:34.160
 source of money

1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:36.160
 in central bank reserves

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:38.160
 I don't think bitcoin is going to

1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:40.160
 serve those types of purposes and so on

1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:42.160
 so for various reasons

1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:44.160
 I prefer gold to the other

1:17:44.160 --> 1:17:46.160
 but it's a little bit part of my mix

1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:48.160
 but then you look at it

1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:50.160
 it hit I think 69,000 this year

1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:52.160
 is the high bitcoin hit

1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:54.160
 do you think it's possible

1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:56.160
 you mentioned gold

1:17:56.160 --> 1:17:58.160
 do you think it's possible it reaches

1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:00.160
 very high numbers

1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:02.160
 like one million that some people talk about

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:04.160
 I don't think that's possible

1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:06.160
 because the way I look at it is

1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:10.160
 there's a certain amount of

1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:16.160
 a certain amount of it

1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:18.160
 and there's a certain amount of gold

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:20.160
 I'll use gold as a benchmark

1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:22.160
 the amount of it

1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:24.160
 is worth about

1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:26.160
 about $1 trillion

1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:28.160
 total crypto is about

1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:30.160
 $2.2 trillion

1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:32.160
 but let's say bitcoin

1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:34.160
 is about $5 trillion

1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:36.160
 if you take the amount of money

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:38.160
 that is in

1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:40.160
 gold

1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:42.160
 that is not used for jewelry purposes

1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:44.160
 and not used by

1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:46.160
 central banks and I assume

1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:48.160
 bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes

1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:50.160
 or central bank purposes

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:52.160
 that amount

1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:54.160
 in gold is about $5 trillion

1:18:54.160 --> 1:18:56.160
 so right now

1:18:56.160 --> 1:18:58.160
 if you were to

1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:00.160
 have a portfolio that has

1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:02.160
 gold and crypto

1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:04.160
 gold and bitcoin

1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:06.160
 it's worth about 20% of the value

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:08.160
 of gold

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:10.160
 do I think it's going to be

1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:12.160
 worth more than gold

1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:14.160
 in terms of that mix

1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:16.160
 I don't think it'll be worth more than

1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:18.160
 gold but let's say

1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:20.160
 it became worth

1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:22.160
 as much as gold

1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:24.160
 I don't believe it will be

1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:26.160
 I think the 20% sounds kind of about right

1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:28.160
 I really don't know what the right answer is

1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:30.160
 and then there's the question

1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:32.160
 of what is all of that

1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:34.160
 pool of money

1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:36.160
 let's say gold and gold equivalents

1:19:36.160 --> 1:19:38.160
 relative to everything else

1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:40.160
 does it go from

1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:42.160
 let's call it

1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:44.160
 $6, $7, $8 trillion to $16 trillion

1:19:44.160 --> 1:19:46.160
 maybe it could double

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:48.160
 it depends what it is in the world environment

1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:50.160
 but basically

1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:52.160
 if you use gold as a measure

1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:54.160
 there's no

1:19:54.160 --> 1:19:56.160
 it just makes no sense

1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:58.160
 that it's going to be used

1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:00.160
 that much more

1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:02.160
 am I sure about that?

1:20:02.160 --> 1:20:04.160
 I'm not sure about anything

1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:06.160
 but logically it seems to me

1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:08.160
 that there's a limitation

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:10.160
 on its price

1:20:10.160 --> 1:20:12.160
 in relationship to other things that are like it

1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:14.160
 let me ask

1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:16.160
 for your deep financial analysis

1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:18.160
 on a very important issue

1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:20.160
 I just talked a couple days ago

1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:22.160
 with Elon Musk

1:20:22.160 --> 1:20:24.160
 he wants to put a literal dogecoin on the moon

1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:26.160
 what are your thoughts about dogecoin

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:28.160
 and

1:20:28.160 --> 1:20:30.160
 do you think it'll be the official currency

1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:32.160
 maybe

1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:34.160
 reserve currency on the moon

1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:36.160
 and on Mars?

1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:38.160
 My reaction is that's cute

1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:40.160
 I remember Elon when he first got

1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:42.160
 he first got his money from PayPal

1:20:42.160 --> 1:20:44.160
 I think he said to me

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:46.160
 it was

1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:48.160
 he got $180 million, $90 million

1:20:48.160 --> 1:20:50.160
 he decided to say

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:52.160
 why aren't we going to outer space

1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:54.160
 and he

1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:56.160
 wanted to take a spaceship

1:20:56.160 --> 1:20:58.160
 that would be modified

1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:00.160
 using Russian

1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:02.160
 technology

1:21:02.160 --> 1:21:04.160
 to put

1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:06.160
 a plant

1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:08.160
 and a watering can

1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:10.160
 on the moon

1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:12.160
 or on Mars

1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:14.160
 I think it was

1:21:14.160 --> 1:21:16.160
 and he said

1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:18.160
 first life on Mars

1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:20.160
 or first life on that

1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:22.160
 as an inspiring

1:21:22.160 --> 1:21:24.160
 notion

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:26.160
 then there's always what's behind it

1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:28.160
 I have a lot of respect

1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:30.160
 for Elon's

1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:32.160
 ability to do other things

1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:34.160
 behind it

1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:36.160
 and so I would take that

1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:38.160
 as symbolic

1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:40.160
 and I'd be asking him what's behind it

1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:42.160
 what's next?

1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:44.160
 I'm also just on the topic of dogecoin

1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:46.160
 and memecoin and there's some aspect

1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:48.160
 of humor and lightheartedness

1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:50.160
 that's really interesting

1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:52.160
 about the way

1:21:52.160 --> 1:21:54.160
 we communicate what ideas become viral

1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:56.160
 how to captivate people

1:21:56.160 --> 1:21:58.160
 with ideas

1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:00.160
 there's something about taking things too seriously

1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:02.160
 that somehow slows it all down

1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:04.160
 and it's interesting

1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:06.160
 that's part of human nature somehow

1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:08.160
 humor is part of this whole thing

1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:12.160
 you've talked about the importance

1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:14.160
 of writing ideas down

1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:16.160
 and you have

1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:18.160
 in particular principles

1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:20.160
 and you have this really nice thing

1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:22.160
 in your book

1:22:22.160 --> 1:22:24.160
 I think there's such a brilliant way

1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:28.160
 you have such a brilliant way

1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:30.160
 of highlighting which parts are

1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:32.160
 extra important

1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:34.160
 and you make them bold

1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:36.160
 that's a brilliant idea

1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:38.160
 let me just ask the high level question of

1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:40.160
 what's a good system for

1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:42.160
 taking notes

1:22:42.160 --> 1:22:44.160
 well I find

1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:46.160
 that almost everything happens over

1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:48.160
 and over again

1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:50.160
 and we're in

1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:52.160
 the blizzard of these things happening

1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:54.160
 and what I found

1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:56.160
 is that

1:22:56.160 --> 1:22:58.160
 if I'm making a decision

1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:00.160
 that

1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:02.160
 after I make the decision usually

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:04.160
 or right at the time

1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:06.160
 if I pause and reflect

1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:08.160
 and I write my principle down

1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:10.160
 in other words

1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:12.160
 principle is sort of a recipe

1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:14.160
 what would I use

1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:16.160
 how would I make that decision

1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:18.160
 and what are the criteria around it

1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:20.160
 I find that I make it much more

1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:22.160
 clear it becomes

1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:24.160
 clear and it applies

1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:26.160
 to the next thing that comes along

1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:28.160
 it'll be that way

1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:30.160
 because everything happens over and over

1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:32.160
 and over again and I think people make

1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:34.160
 the mistake of looking at

1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:36.160
 just the one like it's the first one

1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:38.160
 they have I don't know they have the

1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:40.160
 first problem of this sort

1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:42.160
 the first child or whatever it is

1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:44.160
 and this has been happening plenty of times

1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:46.160
 and so if you have the principles

1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:48.160
 I found that

1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:50.160
 that helped me think more clearly about it

1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:52.160
 and it helped me communicate

1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:54.160
 better like why

1:23:54.160 --> 1:23:56.160
 and so over the years

1:23:56.160 --> 1:23:58.160
 over the last 30 years or so

1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:00.160
 that's what I've done

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:02.160
 I did it originally to communicate

1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:04.160
 very well with the people I work with

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:06.160
 you know I set up my company

1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:08.160
 and it was very important to have good communication

1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:10.160
 communication and then we could

1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:12.160
 debate the principles

1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:14.160
 and so that's the process

1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:16.160
 I urge people to do that

1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:18.160
 there are many excellent

1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:20.160
 decision makers

1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:22.160
 and I just wish that they

1:24:22.160 --> 1:24:24.160
 wrote down their principles when

1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:26.160
 this set so

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:28.160
 for example

1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:30.160
 we were talking about Henry Kissinger

1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:32.160
 and his new book is going to come out with a book

1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:34.160
 on leadership

1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:36.160
 and don't just describe the leaders

1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:38.160
 describe then

1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:40.160
 what about them were the essential

1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:42.160
 elements to make a good leader

1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:44.160
 under what circumstances

1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:46.160
 and so if we think about that

1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:48.160
 then also

1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:50.160
 then you begin to think in a

1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:52.160
 principled way

1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:54.160
 and then when you start to think in a

1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:56.160
 principled way life becomes

1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:58.160
 it's so much easier to make

1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:00.160
 decisions and it's so much less

1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:02.160
 confusing because it's like

1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:04.160
 coming up on a species

1:25:04.160 --> 1:25:06.160
 and you say okay well

1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:08.160
 what species is it

1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:10.160
 not just another it's a thing

1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:12.160
 no what species is it

1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:14.160
 and how do I deal with that species

1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:16.160
 effectively

1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:18.160
 and so that's what that is

1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:20.160
 and so I encourage people to write it down

1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:22.160
 I wish anybody who's successful

1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:24.160
 wrote down their principles

1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:26.160
 or their recipes for making those types

1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:28.160
 of decisions. So the events

1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:30.160
 of interest here

1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:32.160
 happens over and over and over

1:25:32.160 --> 1:25:34.160
 in similar ways as you're looking

1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:36.160
 for the patterns and you're defining the process

1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:38.160
 that's right

1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:40.160
 to respond to those patterns

1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:42.160
 and you call that the principles

1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:44.160
 and

1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:46.160
 that allows you to deal with the future effectively

1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:48.160
 so like that codifies

1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:50.160
 the lessons from the past to be able

1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:52.160
 to deal with the future

1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:54.160
 what advice do you have

1:25:54.160 --> 1:25:56.160
 for young folks today in high school

1:25:56.160 --> 1:25:58.160
 in college thinking about

1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:00.160
 how to live

1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:02.160
 have a career they can be proud of

1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:04.160
 or maybe have a life they can

1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:06.160
 be proud of. Know yourself

1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:08.160
 follow your passion

1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:10.160
 make your work

1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:12.160
 and passion the same thing

1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:14.160
 while considering the money part

1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:16.160
 because money will get you

1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:18.160
 freedom and choice

1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:20.160
 and be able to make that but

1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:22.160
 if you know yourself

1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:24.160
 feel the pull

1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:26.160
 and

1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:28.160
 and pursue that passion

1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:30.160
 and

1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:32.160
 along those lines by the way

1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:34.160
 I found

1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:36.160
 that using personality

1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:38.160
 profile tests has been very helpful

1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:40.160
 I've used those for about 25 years

1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:42.160
 for people to help to understand themselves

1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:44.160
 and understand each other so I created

1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:46.160
 a free one

1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:48.160
 that is called

1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:50.160
 principles you it's online

1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:52.160
 it's

1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:54.160
 had remarkable

1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:56.160
 loving people

1:26:56.160 --> 1:26:58.160
 who've taken it learn about themselves

1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:00.160
 but also you can put in

1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:02.160
 somebody else and it'll tell you about

1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:04.160
 your relationship with them

1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:06.160
 that's like 30 minutes is a quick

1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:08.160
 discovery but the main thing

1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:10.160
 is to understand on your journey

1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:12.160
 your hero's journey

1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:14.160
 when you're

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:16.160
 that you will have

1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:18.160
 mistakes and you will have

1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:20.160
 weaknesses and

1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:22.160
 to

1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:24.160
 understand those not fight

1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:26.160
 those because

1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:28.160
 by understanding

1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:30.160
 mistakes you will learn not to make

1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:32.160
 mistakes again I have a principle

1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:34.160
 which is pain plus

1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:36.160
 reflection equals

1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:38.160
 progress and

1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:40.160
 so that reflection is important

1:27:40.160 --> 1:27:42.160
 to know yourself know your pulls

1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:44.160
 know your weaknesses

1:27:44.160 --> 1:27:46.160
 and when you also know

1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:48.160
 your weaknesses and the strengths of other people

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:50.160
 there are people who

1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:52.160
 have strengths where you're weak

1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:54.160
 and you have strengths where they're weak

1:27:54.160 --> 1:27:56.160
 and to be able to work well

1:27:56.160 --> 1:27:58.160
 together is the most effective way

1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:00.160
 of achieving

1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:02.160
 success

1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:04.160
 so yeah it's that journey

1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:06.160
 and there's a life arc

1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:08.160
 and there's a journey

1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:10.160
 and you want to make it the best that you can

1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:12.160
 make it and it has

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:14.160
 it's like a video game

1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:16.160
 you know it has the

1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:18.160
 challenges and the

1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:20.160
 obstacles and the learning

1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:22.160
 experiences and the temptations

1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:24.160
 and all of that

1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:26.160
 and the maximizing learning

1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:28.160
 to go where you want to go

1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:30.160
 to achieve the life you want is

1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:32.160
 the most important that's kind of maybe

1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:34.160
 a long winded way of seeing it

1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:36.160
 but to learn

1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:38.160
 I think I'll try to say it simply

1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:40.160
 there's a five step process

1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:42.160
 step one

1:28:42.160 --> 1:28:44.160
 is know

1:28:44.160 --> 1:28:46.160
 your goals know

1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:48.160
 what you're going after

1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:50.160
 you could have almost anything you want

1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:52.160
 but you can't have everything you want

1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:54.160
 and so you have to prioritize

1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:56.160
 and you move in that direction

1:28:56.160 --> 1:28:58.160
 on the way to your goals you're going to

1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:00.160
 encounter your problems and your obstacles

1:29:00.160 --> 1:29:02.160
 so identifying

1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:04.160
 step two is understanding

1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:06.160
 your problems and your obstacles

1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:08.160
 identify them

1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:10.160
 step three is to diagnose

1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:12.160
 them to get at the root cause

1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:14.160
 of the problem

1:29:14.160 --> 1:29:16.160
 and that could be

1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:18.160
 your causes but it could also be

1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:20.160
 your weaknesses or weaknesses of others

1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:22.160
 but you have to be objective about them

1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:24.160
 once you diagnose them

1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:26.160
 then you go to step four

1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:28.160
 which is to design

1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:30.160
 a way to get around them

1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:32.160
 and then

1:29:32.160 --> 1:29:34.160
 after you have that design

1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:36.160
 you implement that design

1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:38.160
 so you have to follow through and do it

1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:40.160
 and you do that

1:29:40.160 --> 1:29:42.160
 and that will then produce

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:44.160
 its new results which should be better results

1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:46.160
 I call this

1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:48.160
 the looping process

1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:50.160
 it's the evolutionary looping process

1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:52.160
 and

1:29:52.160 --> 1:29:54.160
 you just keep doing that

1:29:54.160 --> 1:29:56.160
 and you learn over a period of time

1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:58.160
 and you move in the direction that you want

1:29:58.160 --> 1:30:00.160
 last question

1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:02.160
 and you only have one minute to answer

1:30:02.160 --> 1:30:04.160
 you dedicate the book

1:30:04.160 --> 1:30:06.160
 quote

1:30:06.160 --> 1:30:08.160
 to my grandchildren and those of their generation

1:30:08.160 --> 1:30:10.160
 who will be participants

1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:12.160
 in the continuation of the story

1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:14.160
 may the force of evolution

1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:16.160
 be with you

1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:18.160
 so let me ask where is this force of evolution

1:30:18.160 --> 1:30:20.160
 taking human civilization

1:30:20.160 --> 1:30:22.160
 and what in this story

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:24.160
 that evolution is writing

1:30:24.160 --> 1:30:26.160
 gives you hope

1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:28.160
 evolution

1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:30.160
 is in a direction toward improvement

1:30:32.160 --> 1:30:34.160
 and the greatest force

1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:36.160
 is

1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:38.160
 man's capacity

1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:40.160
 to adapt and invent

1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:42.160
 and so you see in the charts in the book

1:30:42.160 --> 1:30:44.160
 you see that

1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:46.160
 this upward movement

1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:48.160
 life expectancy

1:30:48.160 --> 1:30:50.160
 health

1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:52.160
 all the things

1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:54.160
 that we think are better

1:30:54.160 --> 1:30:56.160
 you see there's a chart

1:30:56.160 --> 1:30:58.160
 and it shows that over a period of time

1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:00.160
 and you barely see

1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:02.160
 the downturns

1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:04.160
 from depressions and wars

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:06.160
 in that

1:31:06.160 --> 1:31:08.160
 that is the greatest power

1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:10.160
 and man's ability to

1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:12.160
 invent and adapt

1:31:12.160 --> 1:31:14.160
 is evolution

1:31:14.160 --> 1:31:16.160
 and that's the greatest power

1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:18.160
 and that is what

1:31:18.160 --> 1:31:20.160
 gives me justifiable hope

1:31:20.160 --> 1:31:22.160
 and a continuation of that

1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:24.160
 like we mentioned with Elon

1:31:24.160 --> 1:31:26.160
 maybe we'll become a multiplanetary species

1:31:26.160 --> 1:31:28.160
 so not only will we

1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:30.160
 keep creating amazing things here on earth

1:31:30.160 --> 1:31:32.160
 we'll keep expanding out into the cosmos

1:31:32.160 --> 1:31:34.160
 my time horizon

1:31:34.160 --> 1:31:36.160
 isn't

1:31:36.160 --> 1:31:38.160
 yet but I

1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:40.160
 hope so and I agree

1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:42.160
 that that would be in the next

1:31:42.160 --> 1:31:44.160
 so I'm not going to ask you for the best financial

1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:46.160
 system on Mars

1:31:46.160 --> 1:31:48.160
 I think we'll focus on earth for now

1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:50.160
 thank you so much for your brilliance

1:31:50.160 --> 1:31:52.160
 for the books you've written

1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:54.160
 for the works you've done for the inspiration of millions

1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:56.160
 and thank you for

1:31:56.160 --> 1:31:58.160
 spending your valuable time here with me today

1:31:58.160 --> 1:32:00.160
 thank you

1:32:00.160 --> 1:32:02.160
 thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray Dalio

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.160
 to support this podcast

1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:06.160
 please check out our sponsors in the description

1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:08.160
 and now

1:32:08.160 --> 1:32:10.160
 let me leave you with some words from Ray Dalio himself

1:32:10.160 --> 1:32:12.160
 every time

1:32:12.160 --> 1:32:14.160
 you confront something painful

1:32:14.160 --> 1:32:16.160
 you are at a potentially important juncture

1:32:16.160 --> 1:32:18.160
 in your life

1:32:18.160 --> 1:32:20.160
 you have the opportunity to choose healthy and painful truth

1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:22.160
 or

1:32:22.160 --> 1:32:24.160
 unhealthy but comfortable

1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:26.160
 delusion

1:32:26.160 --> 1:32:28.160
 thank you for listening and hope to see you

1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:34.160
 next time
