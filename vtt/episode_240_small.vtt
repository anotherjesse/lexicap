00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
 The following is a conversation with Neil Stevenson, a legendary science fiction writer

00:04.720 --> 00:09.680
 exploring ideas in mathematics, science, cryptography, money, linguistics, philosophy,

00:09.680 --> 00:16.000
 and virtual reality, from his early book Snow Crash to his new one called Termination Shock.

00:16.960 --> 00:22.960
 He doesn't just write novels. He worked at the space company Blue Origin for many years,

00:22.960 --> 00:29.040
 including technically being Blue Origin's first employee. He also was the chief futurist

00:29.040 --> 00:35.840
 at the virtual reality company Magic Leap. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it,

00:35.840 --> 00:42.160
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now here's my conversation with Neil Stevenson.

00:43.360 --> 00:50.560
 You write both historical fiction like World War II in cryptonomicon and science fiction,

00:50.560 --> 00:56.480
 looking both into the past and the future. So let me ask, does history repeat itself?

00:56.480 --> 00:58.960
 In which way does it repeat itself? In which way does it not?

00:59.680 --> 01:06.160
 I'm afraid it repeats itself a lot. So I think human nature kind of is what it is. And so

01:07.360 --> 01:15.040
 we tend to see similar behavior patterns emerging again and again. And so it's kind of the

01:15.840 --> 01:19.040
 exception rather than the rule when something new happens.

01:19.840 --> 01:25.120
 What role does technology play in the suppression or in revealing human nature?

01:25.120 --> 01:33.840
 Well, the standards of living, life expectancy, all that have gotten incredibly better within the

01:33.840 --> 01:41.760
 last, particularly the last 100 years. I mean, just antibiotics, modern vaccines, electrification,

01:42.800 --> 01:48.320
 the internet. These are all improvements in most people's standard of living and health

01:48.320 --> 01:59.600
 and longevity that exceed anything that was seen before in human history. So people are living longer,

01:59.600 --> 02:07.600
 they're generally healthier and so on. But again, we still see a lot of the same behavior patterns,

02:07.600 --> 02:13.840
 some of which are not very attractive. So some of it has to do with the constraints on resources.

02:13.840 --> 02:19.840
 Presumably with technology, you have less and less constraints on resources. So we get to maybe

02:19.840 --> 02:25.760
 emphasize the better angels of our nature. And in so doing, does that not potentially

02:26.480 --> 02:32.000
 fundamentally alter sort of the experience that we have of life on earth?

02:32.000 --> 02:37.840
 You know, until the last 10 or so years, I would have taken that view, I think. But

02:37.840 --> 02:50.320
 people will find ways to be divisive and angry if it scratches a kind of psychological itch

02:50.320 --> 02:57.040
 that they have got. And we used to look at the Weimar Republic, what happened in the economic

02:57.040 --> 03:09.120
 collapse of Germany prior to the rise of Hitler, World War II, and kind of explain Hitler at least

03:09.120 --> 03:15.600
 partially by just the misery that people were living in at that time.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.320
 The economic collapse.

03:18.320 --> 03:25.680
 Yeah, hyperinflation and unemployment and the decline in standard of living. And that

03:25.680 --> 03:33.120
 sounds like a plausible explanation. But there are economic troubles now for sure. We had the bank

03:33.120 --> 03:40.400
 collapse in 2008. And there's stagnation in some people's standards of living. But it's hard to

03:40.400 --> 03:44.960
 explain what we've seen in this country in the last few years, just strictly on the basis of

03:46.080 --> 03:50.640
 people are poor and angry and sad. I think they want to be angry.

03:50.640 --> 03:59.040
 So, without being political in a divisive kind of way, can we talk about the lessons you can

03:59.040 --> 04:06.480
 draw from World War II? This singular event in human history, it seems like. And yet, as you say,

04:07.360 --> 04:09.760
 history rhymes, at the very least.

04:10.640 --> 04:17.520
 Being who I am, I tend to focus on the curious technological things that happened in conjunction

04:17.520 --> 04:21.440
 with that war, which may not be where you want to go.

04:22.480 --> 04:27.520
 Well, there's several things that started to interrupt. So, one in cryptanomicon is more

04:27.520 --> 04:34.960
 like the allentouring side of things. And then there's the outside of technology.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.720
 First of all, there's the tools of war, which is a kind of technology. But then there's just

04:38.720 --> 04:41.760
 like the human nature, the nature of good and evil.

04:41.760 --> 04:49.040
 Yeah. Well, so one of the things that emerges from the war and from the extermination camps is

04:49.040 --> 04:57.760
 that we were never allowed to have illusions anymore about human nature. So, you have to learn

04:57.760 --> 05:04.400
 that lesson to be an educated person. And you have to know that even in a supposedly,

05:04.400 --> 05:11.440
 you know, enlightened civilized society, people can become monsters quite easily. So, that is for

05:11.440 --> 05:13.040
 sure the big takeaway.

05:13.040 --> 05:21.680
 So, do you agree with Solzhenitsyn about what is it, the line between good and evil runs

05:21.680 --> 05:26.480
 through the heart of every man that all of us are capable of evil?

05:26.480 --> 05:33.120
 Great line, yeah. I read a good chunk of the Gulag Archipelago when I was a teenager,

05:33.120 --> 05:40.320
 because my grandfather had it in his house, because he was one of these Americans who was obsessed

05:40.320 --> 05:48.320
 with the Soviet Union and the Soviet threat and wanted people to be aware of some of what

05:48.320 --> 05:55.760
 had happened. And so, he had those books lying around and, you know, I would read them. And

05:55.760 --> 06:03.280
 it's a similar kind of parallel story to what happened in Germany during the war, you know,

06:03.280 --> 06:12.480
 this creation of this system of camps and oppression and lots of troubling behavior.

06:13.360 --> 06:21.600
 To me, it's a story of how fear and desperation combined with a charismatic leader can lead

06:21.600 --> 06:30.320
 to evil. But it's also a story of bravery, of love, of brotherhood and sisterhood and

06:31.200 --> 06:38.080
 basically survival. You have like a man's search for meaning, which is the story of a man

06:38.640 --> 06:45.600
 in a concentration camp, basically finding beauty in life even under most extreme conditions.

06:45.600 --> 06:54.720
 So, to me, World War II is not necessarily a bleak view of human nature. It's a little

06:56.080 --> 07:04.480
 moment of evil that revealed a much bigger good in humanity. So, I'm not so sure that

07:04.480 --> 07:09.760
 it leads me to a pessimistic view of the world, the fact that somebody like Hitler could happen,

07:09.760 --> 07:17.600
 the fact that a lot of people could follow Hitler and get excited and maybe even love the hate of

07:17.600 --> 07:25.440
 the other for some moment of time. I think that's all of us are capable of that, but I think all

07:25.440 --> 07:32.480
 of us also have a capacity for good. And I think, I don't know what you think, but I think we

07:32.480 --> 07:40.560
 have a greater desire for good than evil. And it seems like that's where technology is very

07:40.560 --> 07:47.680
 useful as a guide, as a helping hand. Okay. Can you give me an example, maybe?

07:48.320 --> 07:53.840
 So, I give you examples of futuristic technologies and I can give you examples of current technologies.

07:53.840 --> 08:02.960
 Current technologies, knowledge in the form of very basic knowledge, which is like Wikipedia,

08:04.160 --> 08:10.720
 and search the original dream of Google that I think is very much a success, which is

08:11.280 --> 08:17.360
 making the world's information accessible at your fingertips. That kind of technology

08:17.360 --> 08:26.080
 enables the natural, if this axiom, this assumption that people want to do good is true,

08:26.640 --> 08:32.640
 then letting them discover all of the information out there, false information and true information,

08:32.640 --> 08:38.960
 all of it, and let them explore that's going to lead to a better world, to better people.

08:38.960 --> 08:47.120
 Now, futuristic technologies is, I personally, I mentioned you offline, sort of love artificial

08:47.120 --> 08:54.640
 intelligence. And so AI, that's an assistant, that's a guide, like a mentor to you, that you can,

08:55.200 --> 09:00.800
 in the way that Google searches, but smarter, where you can help send it out and say,

09:01.680 --> 09:08.720
 this is the direction in which I want to grow, not authoritarian lecturing down from the algorithm,

09:08.720 --> 09:16.480
 of telling you, this is how you should grow, but almost the opposite, where you use it as

09:17.760 --> 09:24.480
 an assistant, a servant in your journey towards knowledge. That sounds like an easy thing,

09:24.480 --> 09:27.120
 but it's actually, from an AI perspective, very difficult.

09:27.120 --> 09:33.600
 I mean, this is the theme of a book I wrote called The Diamond Age, which talks about a book that

09:33.600 --> 09:40.560
 essentially does that. And I've been sort of watching people try to come at the problem of

09:40.560 --> 09:47.040
 building that thing from different directions for ever since the book came out, basically.

09:47.600 --> 09:55.520
 And so I kind of have a, although I haven't worked on it myself, I do get a sense of the

09:55.520 --> 10:06.560
 level of difficulty in realizing that goal. So that book is in the 90s. So as Google is coming

10:06.560 --> 10:13.280
 to be, essentially, not Google, but the search engine, the initial search engine, which gave

10:13.280 --> 10:18.960
 birth to Google, essentially, in contrast. Right. Yeah. That was still in the era of

10:18.960 --> 10:25.680
 Alta Vista and Ask Jeeves and multiple different search engines. And yeah, I'm pretty sure I

10:25.680 --> 10:31.280
 had not heard of Google at that point. That would have been 95, 96. And I think the book came out

10:31.280 --> 10:39.200
 in 94. And then, of course, the social networks followed, which is another form of guidance

10:39.200 --> 10:44.560
 through the space of information. Yeah. Well, what happens is that these things come along

10:44.560 --> 10:51.120
 and then people find ways to game them. And so I saw an interesting thread the other day,

10:51.120 --> 11:02.960
 pointing out that 20 years ago, if you had Googled Pythagorean theorem, chances are you would have

11:02.960 --> 11:08.960
 been taken directly to a page explaining the Pythagorean theorem. If you do it now, you're

11:08.960 --> 11:15.040
 probably going to, the top hits are going to be from somebody who's got an angle, who's got a scheme.

11:15.040 --> 11:21.760
 Right. They're like trying to sell you math tutoring or, you know, they're working some kind

11:21.760 --> 11:30.960
 of marketing plan on you. So the traditional engines become actually less useful over time

11:30.960 --> 11:37.360
 for their original educational purpose. That doesn't mean that they can't, it shouldn't be

11:37.360 --> 11:43.360
 replaced by newer and better ones. First of all, to defend the people with the angle,

11:44.640 --> 11:51.520
 right? They're trying to find business models, fund oftentimes, which is funny you went with Pythagorean.

11:51.520 --> 11:59.600
 Like you went at math, those greedy bastards. I know. But it's great. How can we monetize

11:59.600 --> 12:05.600
 the Pythagorean theorem? Well, I mean, education, right? It has to figure out, like,

12:05.600 --> 12:13.360
 people who love math education, for example, love it purely, not purely, but very often love it

12:14.560 --> 12:21.120
 for itself, for just teaching math. Yeah. But then they start, you know, when coming face to

12:21.120 --> 12:25.520
 face with, for example, like the YouTube algorithm, they start to try to figure out, okay, how can I

12:25.520 --> 12:34.240
 make money off of this? The primary goal is still that love of education. But they also want to

12:34.240 --> 12:41.840
 make that level of education their full time job. But I see that sort of that dance of humanity

12:41.840 --> 12:49.440
 with the algorithms as it finds this kind of local pocket of optimality, or suboptimality,

12:49.440 --> 12:55.440
 whatever. Yeah. It gets stuck in it. It's a pocket of some sort. But I see that pocket is way

12:55.440 --> 13:01.040
 better than what we had before in the 80s, right, in the 90s before the internet. But like, and now

13:01.040 --> 13:08.240
 we're now, this is also human nature, we start writing very eloquent articles about how this

13:08.240 --> 13:13.680
 pocket is clearly pocket is not very good. And we can imagine much better lands far beyond.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.080
 But the reality is it's better than before. Yeah. And now we're waiting for

13:18.640 --> 13:23.680
 We have to escape from the local minimum. And you have to wait either for lone geniuses,

13:23.680 --> 13:28.320
 or for some kind of momentum of a group of geniuses that just say, enough is enough,

13:28.320 --> 13:33.120
 I have an idea. Yeah. This is how we get out. And it's too easy to be sort of,

13:34.240 --> 13:38.320
 I think, partially because you can get a lot of clicks in your articles,

13:38.320 --> 13:43.680
 being cynical about being in this pocket. And we are forever stuck in this pocket. And then,

13:43.680 --> 13:50.640
 like, coming up with this grandiose theory that humanity has finally, like, is collapsing, stuck

13:50.640 --> 13:55.440
 forever like a prison in this pocket. But reality, they're just, it's like, it's just clickbait

13:55.440 --> 14:01.920
 articles and books until we, one curious ant comes up with the next pocket.

14:01.920 --> 14:06.480
 Yeah, tunnels through the barrier or gets enough energy to jump over the barrier.

14:06.480 --> 14:12.560
 And eventually we'll be, as you've talked about me, we'll be, we'll colonize the solar system.

14:12.560 --> 14:18.240
 And then we'll be stuck in the solar system. And then people will say, well, we're screwed

14:18.240 --> 14:23.840
 one because when the sun energy runs out, there's no way to get to the next solar system.

14:23.840 --> 14:28.480
 And then, and so on, it goes on until we colonize the entirety of the observable universe.

14:28.480 --> 14:32.720
 Yeah. I think, I think getting out of the solar system is going to be a hard one.

14:32.720 --> 14:39.680
 But so can you, you mentioned this, can you elaborate why you think back to sort of a

14:39.680 --> 14:43.760
 serious question, why do you think it's hard to get outside of our solar system?

14:43.760 --> 14:50.560
 It's just an energy calculator. I mean, you can do it slowly whenever you want.

14:50.560 --> 15:00.880
 But the idea of getting there in, you know, one lifetime or multiple, a few lifetimes is,

15:00.880 --> 15:07.760
 requires huge amounts of energy to, to accelerate. And then you, as soon as you get halfway there,

15:07.760 --> 15:12.960
 you need to expend an equal amount of energy to decelerate, or you'll just go shooting by.

15:12.960 --> 15:21.200
 And so that means carrying a lot of energy. And there's, there's ideas like Urie Milner,

15:22.160 --> 15:27.680
 I think is still funding the, the idea to use laser propulsion to send something

15:28.400 --> 15:35.440
 to another star system, a small object. But it'll have no way to slow down, as far as I know.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.760
 They never talk about that part. Like, how do we slow down?

15:37.760 --> 15:42.880
 Yeah. So, the quick fly by, you take a good picture, I guess.

15:42.880 --> 15:47.280
 Yeah, you better take some good pictures on your way by. So, and that's great if it happens,

15:47.280 --> 15:54.240
 I'm not knocking it. But the amount of energy is, is that's needed is just staggering. And there's,

15:54.240 --> 16:02.480
 there's other issues like just how do you maintain an ecosystem for that long in isolation?

16:02.480 --> 16:07.600
 How do you prevent people from going crazy? What happens if you hit something while traveling

16:07.600 --> 16:13.280
 at a significant fraction of the speed of light? What about it sort of some combination of expanding

16:13.280 --> 16:20.880
 human lifespan, but also just good old fashioned, stable society on a spaceship?

16:20.880 --> 16:26.560
 Yeah. Yeah. The generation ship. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think that's the only way it would,

16:26.560 --> 16:33.680
 it would have to keep going for a long time. And they might get to where they're going and find

16:33.680 --> 16:43.520
 a shitty solar system. Like, we can try to, we can try to do some advanced survey, but I mean,

16:43.520 --> 16:49.920
 if you get there and all the planets in that solar system are just garbage planets, then it's kind

16:49.920 --> 16:56.480
 of a big letdown for, for this like thousand year voyage that you've just, you've just been on.

16:56.480 --> 17:04.960
 Right? So, I mean, we have a pretty narrow range of parameters that we need to stay between in

17:04.960 --> 17:13.440
 order to survive in terms of the gravitational field that we can deal with. So that's such a,

17:13.440 --> 17:20.240
 sets a bound on the size of the planet and what we need in the way of temperature and atmosphere

17:20.240 --> 17:27.440
 and so on. So when you look at all those complications, then basically building

17:29.520 --> 17:34.880
 sort of exactly the environment we want out of available materials in this solar system

17:34.880 --> 17:43.760
 starts to look a hell of a lot better. It's hard to make an economic argument, let's say,

17:43.760 --> 17:50.240
 for, for, for making that journey. One of the things I like about the expanse is the fact that

17:50.240 --> 17:55.600
 the people who are trying to build the starship to go to the other solar system are doing it for

17:55.600 --> 18:03.520
 religious reasons. I think that's the only reason that you would do it. Because economically, it

18:03.520 --> 18:09.680
 just makes more sense to build rotating cylindrical space habitats and make them perfect.

18:09.680 --> 18:15.520
 Well, isn't everything done for religious reasons? Like, why do we exploration? Like,

18:15.520 --> 18:21.840
 what, why, why do we go to the moon again and do the other things? What is JFK said is because,

18:21.840 --> 18:25.360
 not because they're easy, but because they're hard. Isn't that kind of a religious reason?

18:25.920 --> 18:31.200
 I knew a veteran of the Apollo program who once said that the Apollo moon landings were

18:31.200 --> 18:39.680
 communism's greatest achievement. Yeah. So the conflict between nations is a kind of,

18:41.360 --> 18:45.120
 not exactly a religion, but it's what you're talking about. Well, it's a struggle for meaning.

18:45.120 --> 18:50.800
 Yeah. I mean, and that meaning isn't found in some kind of, it's hard to find meaning in

18:50.800 --> 18:56.080
 mathematics. Yeah. It's, it's found in some kind of in music and religion, whatever art.

18:56.080 --> 19:03.200
 I mean, some people do, but those are probably not enough of them to. Well, they, people that find

19:03.920 --> 19:08.320
 meaning in mathematics, they usually find meaning between the lines. Nevertheless,

19:08.320 --> 19:15.600
 not in the actual form, like the approving, approving some kind of thing. Fair enough. Yeah.

19:15.600 --> 19:22.400
 So from a cost perspective, do you actually see a possible future where we're building

19:22.400 --> 19:30.800
 these kind of generation ships and just why not launch them one a year out like a, like

19:30.800 --> 19:39.520
 wandering ants out into the, into the galaxy? I have nothing against it. It's just, like I said,

19:39.520 --> 19:46.480
 it's got a, the motivation to do it has to come from some kind of spiritual or,

19:46.480 --> 19:53.280
 or kind of non tangible calculus. It's a business model perspective. You don't think

19:53.280 --> 19:58.320
 there's a business model there? No, no way. One of the many fascinating things you've done in your

19:58.320 --> 20:04.320
 life, you were at the very beginning, you were the person that convinced you based us to start

20:05.360 --> 20:12.160
 a spaceship company, a space company. You were there at Blue Origin for a few years in the

20:12.160 --> 20:19.200
 beginning, working on alternate propulsion systems, and at least according to Wikipedia,

20:20.240 --> 20:25.120
 alternate business models. Yeah. I mean, to go back to the first thing you said,

20:26.000 --> 20:32.080
 Jeff Bezos is not a guy who required a lot of convincing. He'd been thinking about it since

20:32.080 --> 20:42.080
 he was five years old, and it was an inevitability. But the, the idea that, that kind of got hatched

20:42.080 --> 20:50.800
 in 1999 was to just do some advanced kind of scouting work, you know, explore the corners of

20:50.800 --> 21:00.240
 the, the space of possibilities. And so that's what, that was Blue Operations LLC, which was the

21:00.240 --> 21:08.160
 precursor to Blue Origin. And so it was a small staff of people that, that did that for a few

21:08.160 --> 21:16.800
 years. And I think it was about 2003, 2004, that it swung decisively towards the direction it's,

21:16.800 --> 21:22.800
 it's been following ever since, which is, you know, using basically existing aerospace

21:22.800 --> 21:31.760
 technologies and models to make chemical fueled rockets for space tourism. I believe,

21:31.760 --> 21:37.840
 and I continue to believe that the fact that we use chemical rockets is just an accident of history

21:38.400 --> 21:45.280
 that comes out of World War II. So until World War II, rockets are being built on a small scale

21:45.280 --> 21:54.480
 by people like Robert Goddard. But then Hitler desperately wants to bomb London, but he can't

21:54.480 --> 22:01.200
 quite reach it. And the Luftwaffe has been kind of neutralized. So he decides he's going to lob

22:01.200 --> 22:08.560
 warheads into it with, with rockets, which is a terrible misallocation of resources. It's a

22:08.560 --> 22:15.920
 terrible idea. But so it only could have happened in a dictatorship controlled by a lunatic.

22:17.440 --> 22:22.320
 But that's, that's the situation that existed. So they built these rockets, they, you know,

22:22.320 --> 22:31.360
 that's the V2. And then it's just a complete coincidence that that war ends with atomic

22:31.360 --> 22:38.400
 bombs being developed in a completely separate super weapon program. And so suddenly that the

22:38.400 --> 22:46.080
 existence of the bombs creates a demand for rockets that didn't exist before. Because if you've got

22:46.720 --> 22:54.800
 atomic bombs, you need a way to deliver them. You can do with bombers, but it's a lot better to just

22:54.800 --> 23:01.760
 hurl them to the other side of the world on the top of a rocket. So, so suddenly rockets,

23:01.760 --> 23:08.080
 which had gotten a boost because of Hitler's V2 program, got a much bigger boost during the

23:08.720 --> 23:15.040
 50s and 60s. And it is a complete, you're right. For some reason, never thought of this. It is an

23:15.040 --> 23:20.720
 accident of history that nuclear weapons are developed at a similar time. First of all,

23:20.720 --> 23:26.800
 nuclear weapons didn't have to be developed at the same time as World War II. That's an accident

23:26.800 --> 23:32.880
 in history. And then the fact that, okay, so then Hitler started using rockets, that's an accident.

23:32.880 --> 23:38.240
 Okay, that's fascinating. That's a fascinating set of coincidences.

23:38.240 --> 23:44.320
 Yeah. And which is true of a lot of technologies, by the way. But by the time these rockets are

23:44.320 --> 23:52.720
 kind of working, we've got hydrogen bombs that are so big and so devastating that nobody really

23:52.720 --> 23:57.920
 wants to use them. But it turns out you can fit a capsule with a couple of people in it

23:58.560 --> 24:05.280
 into the socket on the end of a missile that was made to hold a hydrogen bomb.

24:05.280 --> 24:17.280
 So we start doing that instead as a proxy for having a war. I'd love to be in the meeting

24:17.280 --> 24:24.400
 where the first guy brought that up as an idea. It's probably a Russian. Why don't we strap a

24:24.400 --> 24:30.400
 person to the rocket? Yeah. Well, it probably was because they did it first, right? The Russians

24:30.400 --> 24:35.760
 did it. And they had perhaps less respect for safety protocols. Could be. They're a little bit

24:35.760 --> 24:41.840
 more willing to sacrifice a life of an astronaut or to risk the life of an astronaut. Could be.

24:41.840 --> 24:47.520
 Yeah. This is basically the story of how through all of this competition and because of these

24:47.520 --> 24:56.240
 historical accidents, trillions of R&D dollars and rubles were put into development of chemical

24:56.240 --> 25:02.880
 rocket technology, which is now advanced to an incredibly high degree. But there's other ways

25:02.880 --> 25:10.080
 to make things go really fast, which is all that rockets do. It's all orbit is. It's just going

25:10.080 --> 25:18.720
 really fast. And because so many nerds are obsessed with space, people have been thinking about

25:18.720 --> 25:25.120
 alternate schemes for as long as they've been thinking about rockets. And so one of the first

25:25.120 --> 25:36.400
 things that I learned kind of trying to explore new possibilities was that I could put all of my

25:36.400 --> 25:43.920
 brain power to work and be creative as I could and invent some idea that I thought was new

25:44.720 --> 25:50.720
 for making things go fast. And I would always find out that some guy in Russia or somewhere had

25:50.720 --> 26:00.160
 thought the same idea up 50 years ago and figured out all the math. And so at a certain point,

26:00.160 --> 26:06.880
 you give up on trying to invent completely new ideas and just go poking around trying to find

26:06.880 --> 26:17.600
 those guys. So there's a number of ideas that we looked at. Some are crazier, some are less crazy,

26:17.600 --> 26:23.520
 but the direction that that company eventually took was chemical rockets.

26:23.520 --> 26:27.200
 Is there something you can comment on possible ideas? So first of all,

26:31.200 --> 26:34.160
 like you could use nuclear, so nuclear propulsion.

26:34.800 --> 26:42.240
 Yeah. So that's, I mean, you've probably heard of Project Orion, which was Freeman Dyson and

26:42.240 --> 26:51.680
 some of his collaborators had a scheme to power a large space vehicle by detonating atomic bombs

26:51.680 --> 26:57.920
 behind it. And so one of the other people who was working at Blue Operations during this time

26:57.920 --> 27:05.760
 was George Dyson, the son of Freeman. And so we knew all about Project Orion. And he found an old

27:05.760 --> 27:13.280
 film that they'd shot on a beach in La Jolla of a prototype of this that was powered by like

27:14.160 --> 27:20.720
 lumps of C4. So that was an idea. But for a private company, obtaining a large number of

27:20.720 --> 27:27.520
 atomic bombs was probably out of scope. So there's more of a theoretical thing. There's a

27:27.520 --> 27:39.200
 conceptually similar approach using lasers that Freeman worked on with Arthur Cantrowitz

27:39.200 --> 27:45.760
 and some others where you take a pulsed laser and you fire it at a vehicle that has a block of ice

27:45.760 --> 27:54.640
 on the back. And the pulse hits the ice and flashes off a layer of steam that becomes plasma.

27:54.640 --> 28:01.360
 And plasma is opaque because it conducts. And so being opaque, it then absorbs all of the

28:01.920 --> 28:09.200
 energy from the laser pulse and gets really hot and just pushes on the back of the block of ice.

28:09.840 --> 28:13.200
 And then you wait a moment for that to dissipate, and then you do it again.

28:13.920 --> 28:21.600
 So it would just kind of vibrate its way. Like it sounds really violent, but Freeman said that

28:21.600 --> 28:27.360
 if you were wearing like rubber sold tennis shoes standing in this vehicle, you would just feel a

28:27.360 --> 28:34.720
 mild vibration. So there your source of energy is on the ground and you're getting higher specific

28:34.720 --> 28:42.560
 impulse than you could get by burning chemicals. Jordan Kerr and others worked on another laser

28:42.560 --> 28:53.120
 system, the late Dr. Jordan Kerr that just would heat up a heat exchanger by many converging solid

28:53.120 --> 29:01.920
 state lasers from the ground. And Kevin Parkin works on a similar scheme that just uses microwaves

29:03.040 --> 29:11.680
 to do that. We looked at tall towers. I spent a while looking kind of semi seriously at giant

29:11.680 --> 29:19.280
 bullwhips. What's a bullwhip? Just a whip. Just you have them here in Texas, right?

29:19.280 --> 29:23.760
 Yeah, I understand. But how does that have to do with propulsion?

29:23.760 --> 29:29.840
 If you think about it, a whip is an incredibly simple primitive object that can break the speed

29:29.840 --> 29:38.720
 of sound. So it's unbelievable in a way that for thousands of years, people with no technology

29:38.720 --> 29:46.000
 have been able to accelerate objects through the speed of sound just through an architectural

29:46.000 --> 29:59.360
 trick. Just the physics of a moving bend of material in a medium can do this. So that's the

29:59.360 --> 30:04.880
 thing I still think about from time to time. You can use the same physics to make freestanding

30:04.880 --> 30:14.720
 loops of chain or other flexible materials that just kind of stand up under their own physics.

30:16.720 --> 30:22.720
 And it's kind of awesome to imagine. So you imagine using the same kind of physics of a whip

30:23.680 --> 30:33.440
 but have at the end of it a spaceship that would detach at the moment of maximum velocity.

30:33.440 --> 30:37.280
 Why not? Why wouldn't that?

30:37.280 --> 30:44.640
 So part of my motivation in studying that was to ask that question. It was more almost a

30:45.280 --> 30:56.000
 symbolic way of saying, look, there's all kinds of physics we haven't explored yet that it's no

30:56.000 --> 31:04.880
 more crazy than the idea of chemical rockets. It's just that more money's gone into chemical

31:04.880 --> 31:14.160
 rockets. Right? Can I ask you a question on propulsion that's a little bit more out there?

31:14.160 --> 31:21.680
 So I don't know if you've seen quite a lot of recent articles and reports and so on about

31:21.680 --> 31:31.600
 UFOs, like the Tic Tac aircraft. I keep seeing a lot of chatter about it but I haven't gone deep

31:31.600 --> 31:42.400
 into it. So the DOD released footage filmed by pilots and there's a lot of reports about objects

31:42.400 --> 31:47.600
 that moved in ways they haven't seen before that seem to defy the laws of physics.

31:47.600 --> 31:55.840
 If we consider the aircraft that we have today. So the reason I asked you that is because it kind

31:55.840 --> 32:06.960
 of, to me, whatever the heck it is, it's inspiring for the possibilities of ideas for propulsion.

32:07.840 --> 32:14.960
 If it's like secret projects from foreign nations or it's physical phenomena that we

32:14.960 --> 32:20.640
 don't yet understand like ball lightning, all those kinds of things. Or if it is aliens or

32:21.440 --> 32:26.560
 objects from an alien civilization, I most likely believe if it's an object from an alien

32:26.560 --> 32:33.920
 civilization, it's got to be like a really dumb drone that just got lost. It's definitely not

32:33.920 --> 32:42.160
 like the pinnacle of intelligence. It's like some teenagers like science fair experiment.

32:42.160 --> 32:47.600
 Yeah, it just flew for a few centuries out and just landed. And then we humans are all

32:47.600 --> 32:53.520
 like really excited about this wild thing. I mean, what do you think about those?

32:54.640 --> 32:58.720
 First of all, like the millions of reports of UFOs, right? There's some psychology there that's

32:58.720 --> 33:04.800
 deeply cultural. But also the possibility of aliens having visited Earth.

33:05.520 --> 33:10.800
 Yeah, I mean, I'd like to see some better pictures. For the reason I mentioned earlier,

33:10.800 --> 33:16.560
 having to do with the difficulty of traveling between star systems, it's really hard for me

33:16.560 --> 33:24.800
 to believe it's aliens. I just can't understand why you would go to all that trouble to transport

33:24.800 --> 33:32.960
 something across light years and then do what these UFOs are allegedly doing. How is that

33:32.960 --> 33:42.320
 interesting? How does that justify the trip? So if you travel across those kinds of distances,

33:42.320 --> 33:50.240
 you'd make a bigger splash. First of all, I would expect that the arrival of these things would be

33:50.240 --> 33:57.440
 something we'd notice. It's got to decelerate into our solar system by, unless it got here,

33:57.440 --> 34:04.080
 really, really, really slowly. So I guess that's a possibility and just kind of snuck in.

34:04.080 --> 34:07.840
 So at the end, we would detect some kind of footprint in terms of energy?

34:07.840 --> 34:13.760
 You would think. So I actually think your idea of a science fair project gone bad.

34:15.040 --> 34:22.640
 It makes more sense in that it would explain why if these things are alien technologies,

34:22.640 --> 34:27.760
 they're just kind of hanging around our aircraft carriers for no particular reason,

34:29.280 --> 34:37.760
 not trying to communicate. Can you imagine a scenario where aliens have visited Earth

34:37.760 --> 34:41.360
 or are visiting Earth and we wouldn't notice it at all?

34:41.360 --> 34:47.200
 Oh, sure. I mean, if they've got technology to get here, they've probably got technology to

34:47.840 --> 34:50.800
 conceal the fact that they're here. Oh, they're trying to conceal themselves.

34:50.800 --> 34:54.640
 I meant more like they're not trying to conceal themselves, but we're just,

34:54.640 --> 35:00.640
 our cognitive capabilities are like too limited and we are not thinking big enough.

35:00.640 --> 35:06.160
 We're looking for little green men. We're looking for things that operate at a time scale that's

35:06.160 --> 35:15.200
 human like. Yeah, no, I love thinking about ideas like that. That's great science fiction novel,

35:15.200 --> 35:21.440
 father, that the aliens are so different that we simply don't see them.

35:22.080 --> 35:27.600
 I mean, is there, in terms of language, do you think it would be difficult,

35:28.480 --> 35:32.960
 not aliens visiting us, but traveling to other places to find a common language?

35:33.600 --> 35:38.720
 You've written about the importance of language in intelligent civilizations.

35:38.720 --> 35:45.840
 How difficult is the problem to bridge the gap between aliens and humans

35:46.800 --> 35:50.080
 in terms of language so we're not lost in translation?

35:50.080 --> 35:54.720
 Yeah, I mean, there's different takes on that depending on how biologically similar they are

35:55.280 --> 35:59.200
 to us. I mean, there's a school of thought that says basically,

36:02.720 --> 36:07.360
 advanced life has to be carbon based for just reasons of chemistry.

36:07.360 --> 36:14.960
 So right away, if you impose that limitation, then you're assuming something that's starting

36:14.960 --> 36:23.120
 to be biologically similar to us. So if they're about as big as we are and they kind of move

36:23.120 --> 36:29.760
 around in space, in a physical body the way we do, then there's probably a way to solve that

36:29.760 --> 36:38.080
 communication problem. If they're beings of pure energy from Star Trek or something like that,

36:38.080 --> 36:42.320
 then it's a different story. Well, I love thinking about that kind of stuff too.

36:44.560 --> 36:51.840
 Consciousness itself may be, like you said, beings of pure energy.

36:51.840 --> 37:01.440
 I think of life as just complex systems and the kind of forms those complex systems can take

37:02.400 --> 37:06.560
 seems to be much larger than the particular biological systems we see here on Earth.

37:08.000 --> 37:13.600
 I have to ask a Twitter question about aliens. Ready? This is for Twitter.

37:13.600 --> 37:17.360
 What would you expect from Twitter? Can humans have sex with aliens?

37:17.360 --> 37:27.040
 You can pass. I asked the language question. Can they communicate?

37:28.480 --> 37:31.440
 Can they fall in love before sex? That's how it works.

37:33.440 --> 37:36.640
 So which question? Am I answering the sex or the love?

37:38.080 --> 37:45.120
 I mean, it depends what is more fundamental to relations across intelligence species.

37:45.120 --> 37:50.320
 Yeah. I mean, sex can mean a lot of things. So I mean,

37:51.600 --> 37:58.640
 production, right? In Star Trek, in classic Star Trek, you had to

37:59.440 --> 38:07.360
 really suspend your disbelief to think that Spock was half Vulcan and half human,

38:07.360 --> 38:19.280
 right? Because that's just not going to work DNA wise. So if by sex you mean reproductive sex,

38:19.280 --> 38:28.240
 then I would say no unless you go to a panspermia kind of theory, which is that

38:28.240 --> 38:39.040
 humans were seeded onto the planet as part of a galactic program of some sort.

38:39.840 --> 38:44.080
 And then we're just returning home and hanging out with our old relatives.

38:44.080 --> 38:54.240
 Distant cousins. Yeah. Yeah. But that doesn't seem plausible. We know that humans had sex

38:54.240 --> 39:04.160
 with Neanderthals, with Denisovans. So you could think of them as aliens that came from our planet.

39:05.760 --> 39:15.680
 So that's kind of data point, I guess. But if you broaden your definition of sex to mean any kind

39:15.680 --> 39:26.000
 of gratifying physical interaction, then sure. Right. Dancing. And that's how we get to love.

39:26.800 --> 39:30.160
 And love can take many forms. Love can certainly take many forms.

39:30.160 --> 39:35.760
 I have to ask you, in terms of space, just looking at where blue origin is,

39:35.760 --> 39:42.960
 looking at where SpaceX is today, and maybe looking at 10, 20 years out from now,

39:42.960 --> 39:47.520
 are you impressed with what's happening? We just saw William Shatner go up to space.

39:47.520 --> 39:51.840
 Yeah. I was just watching his video this morning before I came here. Yeah.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.400
 Are you impressed with where things stand today?

39:54.400 --> 40:01.520
 Yeah. I mean, SpaceX in particular has done things that are just unbelievable.

40:03.280 --> 40:11.840
 And I don't think anyone was anticipating 20 years ago, let's say, when this all started,

40:11.840 --> 40:18.480
 just the speed with which they'd be able to rack up these incredible achievements.

40:19.120 --> 40:27.200
 If you've kind of even seen a little bit of how the sausage is made, and so the difficulty of

40:27.200 --> 40:36.560
 doing any kind of space travel, what they've achieved is just unbelievable.

40:36.560 --> 40:42.080
 What about maybe a question about Elon Musk, even more than Jeff Bezos?

40:43.360 --> 40:51.280
 He has a very kind of ambitious vision of this project that we're on as a species,

40:51.840 --> 40:56.240
 of becoming a multiplanetary species, and becoming that quickly.

40:57.600 --> 41:02.800
 As soon as possible, landing on Mars, colonizing Mars. What do you think of that project?

41:02.800 --> 41:07.280
 There's two questions to ask. First, the question is, what do you think about the project of

41:07.280 --> 41:17.360
 colonizing Mars? And second, what do you think about a human being who is so unapologetically

41:17.360 --> 41:23.280
 ambitious at achieving the impossible, what a lot of people would say is impossible?

41:23.280 --> 41:34.640
 I think that colonizing Mars is the kind of goal that's easily stated. It's catchy. It's the kind

41:34.640 --> 41:41.520
 of thing that can inspire people to get involved in a way that some other programs might not.

41:42.560 --> 41:47.840
 So I think it's well chosen in that way. I have technical questions about,

41:47.840 --> 41:55.680
 you know, there's a problem of perchlorates on the surface of Mars that's going to be

41:55.680 --> 42:01.120
 big trouble, and there's radiation. So this is known.

42:03.120 --> 42:07.440
 But what about business questions? Do you think, because you mentioned sort of

42:09.200 --> 42:13.760
 going outside of the solar system would best be done for religious reasons?

42:13.760 --> 42:18.480
 What about colonizing Mars? Can you spin it into a business proposition?

42:18.480 --> 42:26.960
 It's hard to think of a resource that's on Mars that could be brought back here cheaply enough to

42:26.960 --> 42:36.960
 compete with stuff we could just dig out of the ground here or grow here. So I don't know if there

42:36.960 --> 42:43.600
 is a business plan for that, or if it's just strictly, we're going to go there and see what

42:43.600 --> 42:53.520
 happens. Maybe again, we need communism to get us going, to give us a reason, a little bit of the

42:53.520 --> 42:59.840
 competition. Well, there's plenty of people who are sufficiently excited by the colonized Mars

42:59.840 --> 43:07.840
 vision that they're willing to just go all in on it, even if there's not a business plan behind it.

43:09.840 --> 43:20.320
 So I think it's well chosen. I think it's probably the only approach to take.

43:20.320 --> 43:29.280
 A lot of the, when white people came to this continent and started colonizing it,

43:32.080 --> 43:38.320
 there was not a lot of coherent planning. What plans they did have turned out to be terrible

43:38.320 --> 43:47.360
 plans. Trying to come up with plans that extend decades into the future is a waste of time.

43:47.360 --> 43:58.800
 To do it for the unexplainable love of the unknown, the journey towards exploring the

43:58.800 --> 44:07.360
 unknown and just keep going. Well, you saw it with Shatner and his reaction to the flight

44:07.360 --> 44:18.960
 yesterday. For him, that trip was more than worth it just for these intangible reasons.

44:18.960 --> 44:21.920
 What did he say? I haven't watched the video yet.

44:21.920 --> 44:30.560
 He was trying to talk a lot about the moment where suddenly you rise above the thin blue

44:30.560 --> 44:40.880
 blanket of the atmosphere and you're up into the blackness. That had a huge impact on him.

44:40.880 --> 44:45.760
 So he was kind of, I wouldn't say groping for words because he was pretty eloquent, but

44:46.400 --> 44:53.520
 he was trying to express his feelings about that in a way that is pretty gripping to watch.

44:53.520 --> 45:01.280
 So you worked on this kind of stuff. We can go back to 10 years ago. You wrote an essay

45:02.480 --> 45:06.480
 called Innovation Starvation. You worked on this kind of idea since then.

45:09.600 --> 45:17.200
 Kind of looking at maybe a little bit cynically about our age today and our unwillingness to

45:17.200 --> 45:23.120
 take on big risky projects. So in the face of that, what do you think of people like Elon Musk?

45:23.760 --> 45:31.600
 Because to me, people like that are inspiring and gives you hope in the face of a more kind of

45:33.120 --> 45:39.360
 pessimistic perspective of our age. Yeah. Well, he's clearly willing to tackle

45:39.360 --> 45:51.840
 big, ambitious projects without a lot of kind of soul searching or trying to make up his mind.

45:54.720 --> 45:58.000
 Just go and do it. Let's dig tunnels under cities. Go.

46:00.480 --> 46:03.680
 Step one, make a joke about it on Twitter. Step two, actually do it.

46:03.680 --> 46:13.040
 Yeah. And I mean, things have slowed down quite our ability to build things

46:15.200 --> 46:21.200
 at pace is a lot less than it was. And there's reasons for that. We're more concerned with

46:21.200 --> 46:27.200
 safety and environmental impacts than people were when they were building some of the great

46:27.200 --> 46:34.880
 public's works projects of the mid 20th century. But we're at the point now where even just

46:34.880 --> 46:41.760
 maintaining the stuff that we've got is such a huge project that we need to put big resources

46:41.760 --> 46:51.280
 into it and good minds into it or else we're going to be losing things that we take for granted.

46:51.280 --> 46:57.680
 Do you think that there's a lot to be done in the digital space that we mentioned sort of

46:57.680 --> 47:02.960
 Wikipedia and knowledge? Don't you think there could be a lot of flourishing in the space of

47:02.960 --> 47:09.200
 innovation in terms of innovation in the digital space? Yeah. I mean, I'd like to see that. I think

47:09.200 --> 47:17.920
 it's where a lot of the brain power went during the last couple of generations because people who

47:17.920 --> 47:26.160
 might previously have been building rockets or other kinds of hard technologies ended up instead

47:26.160 --> 47:34.400
 going into programming computer science, which is understandable and great. We've got structural

47:34.400 --> 47:42.880
 problems right now in the way social media works that are pretty severe. And so I certainly hope

47:42.880 --> 47:49.040
 that we're not 10 years from now that we're not exactly where we are today when it comes to that

47:49.040 --> 47:56.480
 stuff. We need to move on. The beautiful thing about problems is they show you how not to do

47:56.480 --> 48:05.680
 things and they give you give opportunity to new ideas to flourish and to beat out the ideas of the

48:05.680 --> 48:16.240
 old, which is a dream for me to see new social media that beats out the ways of the old. So I

48:16.240 --> 48:23.200
 tend to, you perhaps agree that it's impossible to do social media well. No, no, no. I mean, I

48:23.200 --> 48:30.160
 listened to your interview with Jaren a couple of weeks ago and I know Jaren and we've talked about

48:30.160 --> 48:38.480
 this. He went hard on me. He basically said it's impossible. It is very nice. Well, the last time

48:38.480 --> 48:45.840
 I kind of paid attention to Jaren's thoughts on it, he was thinking in terms of that basically

48:45.840 --> 48:53.440
 there should be micropayments such that if I, by clicking the like button on something, I'm

48:53.440 --> 49:03.360
 essentially giving valuable intellectual property to Facebook or Twitter or whatever. It's not a

49:03.360 --> 49:09.760
 very large amount of IP, but it's definitely a transfer of information that when they aggregate

49:09.760 --> 49:18.240
 it is beneficial to them. So, and now I do remember that he, on his interview with you,

49:18.240 --> 49:24.960
 was talking about what, data unions or yeah. Those are a lot of interesting ideas, but for me,

49:24.960 --> 49:33.040
 the biggest disagreement was in the level of cynicism. He has a distrust in cynicism towards

49:33.920 --> 49:41.760
 people in Silicon Valley being able to do these kinds of things. And I'm really, okay, when you

49:41.760 --> 49:46.640
 have a large crowd of people that are doing things the wrong way, you should nevertheless

49:46.640 --> 49:52.320
 maintain optimism. Because what's important is to find the one person in that room that's going

49:52.320 --> 49:57.680
 to do things the right way. Cynicism is going to completely silence out the whole room. So,

49:57.680 --> 50:04.560
 he was saying, I've been here a long time. Oh, yeah. I've known, you know, I just like how these

50:04.560 --> 50:11.920
 folks work. They think they're gods and they know the right way to do things and they will

50:11.920 --> 50:17.840
 tell you how to do those things. And that kind of hubris is going to always lead you astray

50:17.840 --> 50:23.360
 when you are the one who's engineering the algorithms. And there's a lot of deep truth to

50:23.360 --> 50:31.440
 that because algorithms are powerful. And many people when given power do not do the best of

50:31.440 --> 50:37.600
 things. I mean, most, what is it, the old Lincoln line, if you want to test the man's character,

50:37.600 --> 50:44.720
 give him power. Yes. But that doesn't mean that some people are not able to handle the power,

50:44.720 --> 50:50.480
 that some people are not able to come up with good ideas that create better social media.

50:50.480 --> 50:57.200
 Yeah. I didn't interpret Jaren's statements as being entirely cynical and hopeless. I mean,

50:57.200 --> 51:04.160
 he's definitely raising, you know, issues of concern. But he wouldn't be out, you know,

51:04.160 --> 51:08.640
 writing the books that he's written and talking about this stuff if he didn't think there was a

51:08.640 --> 51:13.680
 way. If he didn't think there was hope. Yeah. And part of it, as you probably know with Jaren,

51:13.680 --> 51:18.240
 he just loves a good argument. Yeah. He just loves to have a little bit of fun.

51:19.440 --> 51:28.080
 Well, I have to ask you about, I mean, we talked about taking all big, bold, risky ideas. So in

51:28.080 --> 51:35.280
 your new book, Termination Shock, it's set here in Texas. Part of it is, yeah. Yeah. Most of it.

51:35.280 --> 51:42.000
 Yeah. It's a great place to set it. So in it, the main character, TR, McCooligan, a Texas billionaire,

51:42.000 --> 51:48.240
 oil man at truck stop, Magnate decides to solve climate change, take on climate change by himself.

51:48.240 --> 51:54.480
 So this is an interesting philosophical exploration of how to solve climate change from a perspective

51:54.480 --> 51:59.680
 that's perhaps different than we've been thinking about. Yeah. I wouldn't use the word solve, but

51:59.680 --> 52:07.280
 let's say ameliorate. Ameliorate. The temporary effects, but please. Take on. Yeah. Take on

52:07.280 --> 52:13.680
 the challenge. So it's very interesting, but as, so there's a gradual nature to this process.

52:13.680 --> 52:26.720
 And, I mean, just like in your book, the power of innovation is something that has

52:27.920 --> 52:34.160
 saved us quite a few times in history. So what role does that play in this gradual process?

52:34.160 --> 52:43.840
 Right. So ultimately, we don't solve the problem until we get the CO2 out of the atmosphere, but

52:43.840 --> 52:52.240
 that is going to take a while. We're still adding more. We haven't even started to reduce the amount.

52:52.240 --> 52:58.960
 So there's two possibilities inside to ensure up is reduce the amount that we're putting in the

52:58.960 --> 53:04.640
 atmosphere and two is removing what we got in the atmosphere. We have to do both.

53:04.640 --> 53:10.800
 Right. And those are two different kind of efforts in terms of what's involved.

53:10.800 --> 53:17.200
 Because it stays up there. So I think just last week, China announced that they're going to try to

53:17.200 --> 53:28.240
 level off their CO2 emissions in like 2030. So 2031, they'll only put as much CO2 into the atmosphere

53:28.240 --> 53:36.560
 as they did in 2030, which is still a lot of CO2. In 2060, they're saying we'll be net zero.

53:36.560 --> 53:44.560
 So if everyone in the world does that, and the PPM of CO2 in the atmosphere by then is say 450

53:44.560 --> 53:52.560
 parts per million, it'll stay at 450 parts per million until we take it out. And taking it out

53:52.560 --> 54:02.800
 is hard. It's a big. We took us a long time. We had to empty out huge coal mines and oil reservoirs

54:02.800 --> 54:09.920
 and burn all that stuff. We had to chop down forests and dig up peat bogs in order to create

54:09.920 --> 54:18.560
 all of that CO2. And so we have to reverse all of those processes somehow in order to remove

54:18.560 --> 54:25.200
 the CO2 and get it back down hopefully into the 200 and some parts per million range where it used

54:25.200 --> 54:31.600
 to be. So how about you get a single Texas billionaire to have a massive gun that blasts

54:31.600 --> 54:36.880
 huge quantities of sulfur into the upper atmosphere? That's idea number one.

54:38.080 --> 54:45.120
 This is called solar geoengineering. And we know that it's a possibility on a technical level,

54:45.120 --> 54:52.400
 because volcanoes have been doing it forever. So many times in human history, we've seen a

54:52.400 --> 54:58.080
 volcanic eruption that was followed by a global cooling trend that lasted for a couple of years.

54:58.800 --> 55:04.000
 And one of these things happened, I think in the 60s or 70s in Indonesia and

55:05.600 --> 55:11.440
 the Australians sent a plane up into the stratosphere to take some samples of the plume.

55:11.440 --> 55:18.080
 And when it came back down, the windscreen of the plane had sort of a deposit on it. So one of the

55:18.080 --> 55:27.200
 Australian scientists licked it and reported that it was painfully acid. So that was our first

55:27.200 --> 55:33.600
 kind of clue that what was being injected into the stratosphere was sulfur dioxide.

55:33.600 --> 55:43.600
 And so we know, then Pinatubo came along in the 90s and did this experiment for us. So we know that

55:44.320 --> 55:51.360
 sulfur in the stratosphere, it forms little spherical droplets of sulfuric acid after it

55:51.360 --> 55:59.600
 combines with water. And those bounce back some of the sun's rays and reduce the amount of solar

55:59.600 --> 56:07.680
 energy entering the troposphere, which is where we live. So we know that it works. And we also

56:07.680 --> 56:14.720
 know that this stuff goes away after a couple of years. So it gradually washes out. And so

56:14.720 --> 56:23.360
 it's not a permanent thing. Good news, bad news is it's not permanent. So if you don't like

56:24.320 --> 56:28.960
 what's happening, you can just stop and wait a couple of years and you'll get back to where

56:28.960 --> 56:34.720
 you started. And the bad news, if you're in favor of this kind of thing, is that you have to keep

56:34.720 --> 56:45.520
 doing it forever. So this guy's one of those, he's read these papers, the TR, the character in the

56:45.520 --> 56:53.760
 book, he knows all this. And all people who are familiar with climate science kind of know this.

56:53.760 --> 57:02.560
 It's a pretty well established fact. And so he just decides he's going to take action unilaterally

57:02.560 --> 57:10.480
 and do this. And so there's different ways to get the sulfur up there. But because it's Texas,

57:10.480 --> 57:15.840
 he builds the biggest gun in the world. It's just six barrels pointed straight up and he

57:15.840 --> 57:22.240
 begins firing shells loaded with sulfur into the stratosphere. And so the book is about not so much

57:22.240 --> 57:30.080
 that as how people react to his doing that, what the political ramifications are around the world,

57:30.080 --> 57:38.320
 because this is an extremely controversial idea. And not everyone's on board with it. And even if

57:38.320 --> 57:46.080
 you are willing to consider using a technological intervention, the fact is that it's going to

57:46.080 --> 57:54.800
 have different effects on different parts of the world. So some areas may suffer more negatives

57:54.800 --> 58:03.440
 than positives and they're not going to be happy. So what do you think? So in his case, in TR's case,

58:03.440 --> 58:12.080
 he can get around getting permission from governments. If we were to look at our

58:12.080 --> 58:20.000
 us facing outside of the store, us facing climate change, where do you think the solution

58:20.000 --> 58:27.760
 will come from? Governments working together or from bold billionaire Texans?

58:28.880 --> 58:36.560
 I'm pretty sure that this kind of intervention is never going to emerge from western democracies.

58:36.560 --> 58:42.000
 At this kind of, sorry, government coordinated, which option one?

58:42.000 --> 58:43.840
 Solar geoengineering.

58:43.840 --> 58:49.920
 Solar geoengineering. From a government, from a, like those are, I want to sort of the distinction.

58:51.360 --> 58:57.200
 One is the idea, the technological idea you're talking about, but two is like who comes up

58:57.200 --> 59:00.400
 with the idea and agrees on it, governments or individuals.

59:00.400 --> 59:07.280
 Yeah. If this were to happen, I think it would be either an individual or more likely just some

59:07.280 --> 59:13.440
 government somewhere that just decides it's in their interests to unilaterally do this.

59:15.280 --> 59:25.040
 And that's not me advocating it. It's just, it would be comparatively so cheap and easy to

59:25.040 --> 59:32.800
 implement a solar geoengineering scheme that someone is probably going to do it once things

59:32.800 --> 59:38.960
 get bad enough. But I don't think that the government will, or western governments,

59:38.960 --> 59:44.480
 just because they're not, well, we've seen what happened with vaccines.

59:44.480 --> 59:55.840
 Right. So getting people to take vaccinations or wear masks has turned out to be incredibly hard,

59:55.840 --> 59:58.400
 even though it might save those people's lives.

1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:07.200
 See, I blame, that's not western. That's, I blame failure of leadership there, of leaders

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:13.040
 being not coming off as authentic, not being inspiring, uniting, all those kinds of things.

1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:17.760
 I think that's possible. I think it's just that we've gotten the leaders we have right now,

1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:23.600
 aren't the right people because we've lived through kind of a long stretch of relatively

1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:30.480
 comfortable times. And it feels like unfortunate if you just look at history that hard times

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:40.080
 make great leaders and easy times make bureaucrats that are egotistical and greedy and not very

1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:45.440
 interesting and not very bold. Yeah. No, I think that's fair. So we may be entering one of those

1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:54.800
 interesting times of hardship in the Chinese curse sense. Yeah. So I could be wrong. But I mean,

1:00:54.800 --> 1:01:03.600
 there have been some efforts to explore solar geoengineering. There was a plan to send up

1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:10.080
 some balloons, high altitude balloons to take some measurements in Scandinavia that got

1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:20.000
 squashed by objections from people who lived up there who were just opposed to the whole program

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:28.400
 on principle. So we'll see a lot more of that. And it's going to be a hard program to advocate for

1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:35.280
 just because I think people don't quite understand how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:44.800
 and how far we are from even slowing down the rate that we're adding more to say nothing of

1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:49.840
 bringing that number down. We're a long way out from that.

1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:55.760
 Do you see in terms of portfolio of solutions us becoming a multi planetary species as part of

1:01:55.760 --> 1:02:05.840
 that? Is this also being a motivator for investing some percent of GDP into becoming a multi

1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:11.760
 planetary species? And what percent should that be, you think? In an indirect way, maybe. I mean,

1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:17.760
 you know what people will say, which is the same argument that has been leveled against

1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:23.680
 space exploration since the Apollo program, which is why don't we solve our problems here on Earth

1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:30.960
 before we spend money going into space? So I've never been a believer in that argument.

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:40.800
 I think there could be a sense in which the new perspective that could be obtained by

1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:49.920
 and like if we're thinking about terraforming Mars, changing its atmosphere, making it more

1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:57.680
 amenable to life and survival, you could see that maybe changing people's opinions about

1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:03.360
 terraforming the Earth. Yeah. There are some dangerous consequences to this particular

1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:08.240
 idea of blasting software, of geoengineering.

1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:19.680
 What do you make of sort of big bold ideas that are double edged sword? Are all ideas

1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:26.400
 like this, all big ideas like this, they have the potential to have

1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:34.080
 highly beneficial consequences and a potential to have highly destructive consequences?

1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:39.840
 I wouldn't say all. I think going back to what we were talking about earlier,

1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:45.120
 how technology developed in the 50s and 60s, there was a period of time there when

1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:51.840
 people maybe had unrealistic ideas about new technology and weren't sufficiently

1:03:51.840 --> 1:04:06.240
 attentive to the possible downsides. There's a reason why. In the mid 20th century,

1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:14.960
 we saw antibiotics, we saw the polio vaccine, we saw just simple things like refrigerators in the

1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:24.480
 home. My grandmother to her dying day called the refrigerator the ice box because when she grew up,

1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:31.360
 it was a box with ice in it. You see all that change and it's largely for the benefit of people.

1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:38.400
 If somebody comes along and says, hey, we're going to build nuclear reactors to make energy,

1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:48.560
 or here's a new chemical called DDT that's going to kill mosquitoes, then it's easy to

1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:56.960
 just buy into that and not be alert to the possible downsides. Of course, we know that

1:04:56.960 --> 1:05:05.040
 the way that those early reactors were built and the way that the supply chain was built to

1:05:06.320 --> 1:05:16.480
 create the fuel and deal with the waste was poorly thought out. We're still dealing with

1:05:18.240 --> 1:05:25.600
 the resulting problems at places like Hanford in the state of Washington. We know that DDT,

1:05:25.600 --> 1:05:31.680
 although it did kill a lot of insects, also had terrible effects on bird populations.

1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:41.520
 So the backlash that happened in the 70s that is still going on is to assume that

1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:50.400
 everything is a double edged sword and always to look for. We have to absolutely convince

1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:59.120
 ourselves that the downside isn't going to come back and bite us before we can adopt any new

1:05:59.120 --> 1:06:08.960
 technology. I think people are overly sensitized to that now.

1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:17.200
 Depending on the technology, people are a little bit too terrified of certain technologies,

1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:26.160
 like artificial intelligence is one. My sense is that the things that they're afraid of aren't

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:31.120
 the things that are likely going to happen in terms of negative things. It's probably impossible

1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:37.360
 to predict exactly the unintended negative consequences. But what's also interesting

1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:43.440
 is for AI as an example, people don't think enough about the positive things. I mean,

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:48.880
 the same is true with social media. It's very popular now for some reason to talk about all

1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:55.920
 the negative effects of social media. We've immediately forgotten how incredible it is

1:06:55.920 --> 1:07:02.960
 to connect across the world. There's a deep loneliness within all of us. We long to connect

1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:09.600
 and social media, at least in part, enables that even in its current state. And all the

1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:15.920
 negative things we see with social media currently are also in part just revealing the basics of

1:07:15.920 --> 1:07:21.040
 human nature. It didn't make us worse. It's just bringing it to the surface. And step one of solving

1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:27.200
 a problem is bringing it to the surface. The fact that there's a division, the fact that there

1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:34.080
 were easily angered and upset and all of that, the witch hunts, all those kinds of things,

1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:40.960
 that's human nature. And it just reveals that allowing us to now work on it is therapy. And so

1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:48.560
 that's another example of a technology that's just, we're not considering the positive effects now

1:07:48.560 --> 1:07:54.880
 and in the future enough of, I have to ask you about, there's a million things I can ask you

1:07:54.880 --> 1:08:04.560
 about, but virtual reality, I gotta ask you. You've thought about virtual reality, mixed reality,

1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:11.360
 quite a bit. What are the interesting trajectories you see for the proliferation of virtual reality

1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:18.480
 or mixed reality in the next eight years? Yeah. So I was a magically for what, five years?

1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:25.760
 With the best title of all time. Oh, thanks. Chief futurist? Yeah. Yeah. And so I

1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:34.000
 sort of had a little squad of people in Seattle doing what you might call content R&D. So we're

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:43.920
 trying to make content for AR, but because it's such a new medium, it's more of an engineering

1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:53.760
 R&D project almost than a creative project. So it was fascinating to see everything that goes into

1:08:54.640 --> 1:09:05.120
 making an AR system that runs. So an AR device, if it's really going to do AR,

1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:13.120
 needs to be running slam in real time. And that alone is a big... So for people who don't know,

1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:19.760
 first of all, virtual reality is creating an almost fully artificial world and putting you

1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:28.880
 inside it. Augmented reality AR is taking the real world and putting stuff on top of that

1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:34.720
 real world. And when you say slam, that means in real time, the device needs to be able to sense

1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:42.160
 accurately detect everything about that world sufficiently to be able to reconstruct it. The

1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:50.320
 3D structure of it so you can put stuff on top of it. And doing that in real time, presumably,

1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:56.080
 not just real time, but in a way that creates a pleasant experience for the human perception system

1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:04.720
 is... Yeah, that's an engineering project. Right. Yeah, well said. And it's just one of the things

1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:10.800
 that the system has to do. It's also tracking your eyes so it knows what you're looking at,

1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:22.000
 how far away what you're looking at is. It's performing all those functions and it's got to

1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:30.160
 keep doing that without burning up the CPU or depleting the battery

1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:37.440
 unreasonably fast. And that's just table stakes. It's just the basic functions of the

1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:43.840
 operating system. And then any content that you want to add has to sit on top of that. It's

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:51.760
 got to be rendered by the optics at a sufficiently low latency that it looks real and you don't get

1:10:51.760 --> 1:11:02.400
 sick. So it's an amazing thing and a magically shipped device that can do that in 2019. And

1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:08.960
 they're about to ship the ML2. But I don't know any more about that than anyone else because

1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:16.560
 I don't work there anymore. Does it still, to some degree, boil down to a killer app,

1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:22.720
 a content question? Like you said, it's kind of a wide open space. Nobody knows exactly what's

1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:29.600
 going to be the compelling thing. So doesn't a super compelling experience of some sort

1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:34.560
 alleviate some of the need for engineering perfection?

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:41.920
 Well, there's a base layer of engineering that you have to have, no matter what. But you're

1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:48.320
 certainly right that people, like in the early days of video games, put up with kind of low frame

1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:54.160
 rate and what we would now call crappy graphics because they were having so much fun playing

1:11:54.160 --> 1:12:07.760
 Doom or whatever. Even Tetris. Yeah, yeah. So for sure that's true. And so I was working on

1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:15.120
 consumer facing content. There was a great team in Wellington, New Zealand that made a game

1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:27.520
 called Dr. Groedbrot's Invaders that realized the potential of AR gaming in a way that I

1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:38.160
 don't think anything else has before or since. And so that was definitely the strategy until

1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:48.880
 April 2020, which is when the company decided to pivot to commercial industrial applications

1:12:48.880 --> 1:13:00.720
 instead. And I haven't seen their financial projections, but I assume they had good reasons

1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:10.000
 for making that strategic decision. It just means that it's no longer necessarily targeted at

1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:16.720
 just end users who want to play a game or be entertained. But it's, you know.

1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:23.200
 That to me from a sort of a dreamer, future perspective is heartbreaking because I don't

1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:31.680
 know necessarily from in the VR space, but I see this kind of thing with robotics where,

1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:40.400
 to me, the future of robotics is consumer facing. And a lot of great roboticists,

1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:46.800
 Boston Dynamics and companies like that are focused on sort of industrial applications.

1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:52.880
 Yeah. Yes. For financial business reasons. Yeah. Now, I can see the parallels for sure.

1:13:53.760 --> 1:14:03.920
 We'll see. It was a fun project. We worked on an app, for example, called Baby Goats,

1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:09.200
 which just populated your room with Baby Goats. That seems like a killer app right there.

1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:20.400
 Well, we thought highly of the idea for sure. Yes. But because of the slam, the system knew,

1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:27.280
 for example, here's a table. Here's a little end table. We know the heights. We know how high

1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:35.920
 our animated Baby Goat can jump. And so our engineers had to build a system for converting

1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:47.280
 the slam primitives into game engine objects that the AI's in the game could navigate around.

1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:54.880
 So, and that ended up shipping as more of a dev kit or a sort of how to, a sample app

1:14:55.920 --> 1:15:02.640
 than as a finished consumer facing. You mean the Baby Goat AI, yeah.

1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:10.240
 Yeah. That seems to me like a world, I can entertain myself for hours, just every day

1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:16.640
 coming home to see of Baby Goats. Yeah. I mean, it was an ambient kind of,

1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:23.280
 it's not a thing that you would sit there and play like a video. Just life. Yeah. Yeah. But no,

1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:28.880
 there's Baby Goats. I mean, what's the purpose of having dogs and cats in your life? Exactly.

1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:33.840
 It's kind of ambient. Yeah. They're not really helping you do anything, but it's enriching

1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:37.760
 your life. And you can go and play fetch or something for a while if you want, but you don't

1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:47.440
 have to. Right. Yeah. So we worked on that in a bigger project that was more of a storytelling

1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:55.040
 and a fictional universe. The hardware is worth a look. There's still a belief, I just saw it

1:15:55.040 --> 1:16:01.520
 this morning looking at Twitter that the Magic League never shipped anything. But they've been,

1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:08.400
 since 2019, you can go to their website and buy one of these devices anytime you

1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:15.920
 want to spend the money. Yeah. And then you want it's coming out, I think in 2022, so in a few months.

1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:26.480
 What do you think, looking at 50 years from now, what wins virtual reality, augmented reality,

1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:38.720
 or physical reality? What wins? Meaning like what's, what do people that have financial resources

1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:47.520
 enjoy spending most of their time in? I've always been a fan of AR and it's kind of

1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:52.720
 an easy answer because if you're wearing an AR device and you put a bag over your head,

1:16:52.720 --> 1:17:02.880
 it becomes a VR device. If you block out what's really there, then all you're seeing is a VR.

1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:11.680
 But you are with AR constrained to kind of operate in something that's similar to physical

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:20.080
 reality. With VR, you can go into fantastical worlds. True. So there are still issues in

1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:33.760
 those fantastical worlds with motion sickness. So if your body is experiencing acceleration,

1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:40.320
 your inner ear, that differs from what your eye thinks it's seeing, then you'll get sick

1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:48.160
 unless you're a very unusual person. So it doesn't mean you can't do it. It's a constraint that

1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:55.120
 VR designers have to learn to work with. So do you think it's possible that in the future,

1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:02.320
 we are living mostly in a virtual reality world? Like it would become more and more detached from

1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:09.920
 physical reality? For entertainment maybe, for certain applications. I'm personally more,

1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:14.720
 I mean, we have to make a distinction between what I would personally

1:18:14.720 --> 1:18:20.080
 find interesting and what might win in the market. So maybe some people,

1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:29.040
 maybe lots of people would like to spend a huge amount of time in VR. I'm personally more interested

1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:35.200
 in enhancing the experience that I have of the physical world because the physical world's

1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:42.160
 pretty cool. There's a lot to be said for moving around in the real world.

1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:49.120
 Can I ask you for you personally to try to play devil's advocate or to try to construct,

1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:57.120
 to imagine a VR world where you and Neil Stevens wouldn't want to stay?

1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:03.120
 Not because the physical world all of a sudden became really bad,

1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:10.560
 for some reason, like you're trying to escape it. But like literally it's just more enriching,

1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:15.920
 in the same way, there's a glimmer in your eye when you said you enjoy the physical world,

1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:22.640
 like double up on that glimmer for the virtual reality. Can you imagine such a world?

1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:29.440
 Well, I'll give maybe an example that's a bridge, which is that I've been, I like making things.

1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:37.520
 So I like working in a machine shop and making objects with 3D printers or machines or whatever.

1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:46.160
 And so I've had to learn how to get good at using a CAD program. There's many to choose from.

1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:59.440
 I use one called Fusion 360. And I can spend hours in that trying to create, imagine and

1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:09.040
 create the things I want to create. And it's not virtual reality exactly, but that whole time,

1:20:09.040 --> 1:20:16.640
 my whole field of view is occupied by this monitor that's showing me a window into a

1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:23.680
 three dimensional space. I'm rotating things around. I'm imagining things. I'm making things.

1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:31.040
 And so that is pretty close to being in virtual reality.

1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:35.440
 Does that thing have to exist for you to experience true joy? Can you stay

1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:41.520
 in Fusion 360 the whole time? Do you have to 3D print it and touch it?

1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:49.120
 Yeah. I mean, that's my game. That's what I'm up to. But it happens that if you're building

1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:57.520
 a virtual environment, if you're making a game level or creating a virtual set for a film or TV

1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:02.480
 production, the thing that you're designing in the program may never physically exist.

1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:09.440
 And in fact, it's preferable that it doesn't because the whole point of that is to

1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:17.040
 make imaginary things that you couldn't build otherwise.

1:21:17.040 --> 1:21:22.720
 So I think lots of people spend a good chunk of their working hours in something that's pretty

1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:28.640
 close to VR. It's just that currently the output device happens to be a rectangular object

1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:36.640
 in front of them. You could replace that with a VR headset and they'd be doing the same stuff.

1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:42.160
 There's all kinds of interfaces. For example, I enjoy listening to podcasts or audiobooks,

1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:48.080
 but let's say actually podcasts because there's an intimate human connection in a podcast.

1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:52.400
 It's one way, but you get to learn about the person you're listening to.

1:21:53.040 --> 1:21:57.360
 And that's a real connection. And that's just audio for a lot of people. That's just audio.

1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:05.120
 True. And like for me, that's just audio as a fan of people. And you kind of a little bit

1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:10.080
 are friends with those people. Yeah, they're in your life. You're listening to them. Yeah.

1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:18.000
 And I mean, they're not, they're as far away from real as he gets. There's not even a,

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:22.640
 there's not even a visual component. It's just audio, but they're as real.

1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:30.160
 Like if I was on a desert island, like my imagination, like this thing works pretty good

1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:38.320
 in terms of imagination. Like that it creates a very beautiful world with just audio.

1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:46.320
 So, I mean... Or even just reading books. Exactly. Reading books. Even more so with

1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:51.520
 reading books. Because there are certain mediums which stimulate the imagination more.

1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:59.040
 When you present less, the imagination works more. And that can create really enriching

1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:08.240
 experiences. So, I mean, to me, the question is, can you do some of the amazing things that make life

1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:15.760
 amazing in virtual worlds? It seems to me the answer there is obviously yes. Even if I like you

1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:22.000
 and attached to a lot of stuff in the physical world, I think I can very readily imagine

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:29.040
 coming up with some of the same magical experiences in the virtual world. Or you make

1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:39.520
 friends and you can fall in love where the source of love in your life is to a much greater degree

1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:46.320
 inside of a virtual world. And then love means fulfillment. That means happiness. That's the

1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:51.040
 thing you look forward to. And not some kind of dopamine rush type of love, but like long,

1:23:51.040 --> 1:24:00.640
 long, long lasting friendship. Yeah. It just depends on what is there in the way of applications,

1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:06.960
 the content, and can it feed you those things? Can it give you... Like in my example of using

1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:15.360
 the CAD program, it gives me the ability to do something I enjoy, which is making, imagining

1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:21.600
 things and making things in a particular way. Can we psychoanalyze you for a second? Sure. What

1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:28.880
 exactly do you enjoy? Is there some component of you building the thing where you get to at least

1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:35.360
 a little bit share with others? Like, is there a human in the loop outside of you in that picture?

1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:43.680
 Will anyone ever see it? Right. There's a source of your enjoyment because I would argue

1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:50.480
 you that perhaps when like the turtles all the way down, when you get to the bottom turtle,

1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:55.520
 it has to do with other sharing with other humans. And if you can then put those humans

1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:03.520
 inside the VR world, then you start to... Then you can... Okay. For example, you could do it in

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:10.400
 the physical world, the 3D printing, but you share it in the virtual world. And that's where

1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:16.720
 the source of happiness is. I think at least speaking for myself, I'm always thinking in terms

1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:22.800
 of an audience. And at some level, I feel like I'm doing this for someone or communicating

1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:29.200
 to someone, even if there's not a specific someone in mind. It could just be an abstract

1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:37.040
 theoretical someone. And it's like another app I spend a lot of time in is Mathematica.

1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:42.560
 Yeah, incredible app. Yeah. And when I do a Mathematica notebook,

1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:49.280
 if I'm trying to figure something out, I spend a lot of time typing. My stuff is just huge blocks

1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:55.280
 of text, just me thinking out loud, and then some graphs and calculations and stuff.

1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:03.040
 Because to me, that act of explaining things and commenting

1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:08.640
 helps me understand what I'm doing. And there's kind of an audience,

1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:15.840
 amorphous audience in mind. Yeah. I mean, most of this stuff nobody will ever see. And yet,

1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:23.600
 I'm creating it as if there were an audience that might read this stuff. Because that's a

1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:28.560
 necessary constraint that helps me do a better job.

1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:36.320
 What's the, this might be a tricky question to answer. What comes to mind as a particularly

1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:41.120
 beautiful thing that you're proud of that you create inside Mathematica, visualization wise,

1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:45.760
 or something that just comes to memory if it's possible to retrieve?

1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:56.640
 So the thing I've spent the most amount of time on is I got obsessed a long time ago,

1:26:56.640 --> 1:27:01.840
 was trying to tile the globe with hexagons. Yes.

1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:11.520
 And actual globe? Well, any spherical object. Yeah. But with an eye towards putting it on the

1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:18.160
 earth. And so, and have it be recursive. So you can have hexagons within hexagons,

1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:26.320
 which is hard because, and probably a bad idea, because you can't tile a hexagon with smaller

1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:35.200
 hexagons. They don't, they stick out. Got it. So they're, oh, they stick out. So can you do some

1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:43.600
 kind of fractal hexagon situation? Yeah. Yeah. So it's that, and people who know me are always

1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:51.600
 now make fun of me for this. So they'll send me, if they see a picture with hexagons in it,

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:57.280
 they'll like send me a link, you know, to make fun of me. So as some...

1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:03.680
 One of those people, Roger Penrose, or? I think Roger's a little above my level.

1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:12.800
 Oh, he's into hexagons as well, in tiling. Yeah. So I did a lot of that. And I thought, you know,

1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:19.040
 it was pretty cool. But if there's some like surprisingly intractable problems that keep

1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:27.760
 coming up, like you've always got to have some pentagons. Like if you start with the icosahedron,

1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:35.360
 which is equilateral triangles, which is a logical place to start, you can cover those with

1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:45.680
 hexagons. But every vertex where the triangles come together is a pentagon, has to be a pentagon.

1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:49.760
 Oh, I just think so. There's all hexagons and then there's a pentagon at the intersections.

1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:53.280
 Yeah. Yeah. Cool. How did you figure that out? Is that a known fact?

1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:56.000
 Well, it's just if you look at them, like just by instantiation.

1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:03.360
 The obvious thing, got it. Yeah. So you can't make that go away. So any system that you come

1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:12.320
 up with to do this has got to have this exceptions built into it for those 12, you could have quintillions

1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:24.640
 of hexagons, but you still got to have 12 pentagons somewhere. So I've blown a hell of a lot of

1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:31.280
 time on that over the years. By the way, a lot of those kind of problems are very difficult to

1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:38.480
 prove something about. Yeah. Yeah. I think Uber did it because someone,

1:29:39.120 --> 1:29:47.760
 one of my friends who knows of my interest in this and who likes to give me a hard time,

1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:55.920
 sent me a link, this was a couple of years ago, to some code base that I think came out of Uber

1:29:55.920 --> 1:30:03.360
 where they had done this. You break down the whole surface of the earth into little hexagons.

1:30:04.320 --> 1:30:12.480
 So that was a real knife through the heart, but I'll probably come back to it someday.

1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:18.480
 Is there something special about hexagons? Are you interested in all kinds of tiling?

1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:27.680
 Well, I'm interested in all kinds of tiling, but I know my limitations as a math guy.

1:30:28.960 --> 1:30:36.160
 So hexagons are about my speed. Just sufficient amount of complexity.

1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:43.440
 So, but no, tiling is a really interesting problem, both two and three dimensional.

1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:49.040
 So, tiling problems are fascinating and they're one of those ancient puzzles that has

1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:55.280
 attracted Brainiacs for centuries.

1:30:58.800 --> 1:31:07.520
 Let me ask you a little bit about AI. What are some likely interesting trajectories

1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:12.240
 for the proliferation of AI in society over the next couple of decades?

1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:13.520
 Do you think about this kind of stuff?

1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:20.080
 I do not think about it a lot because it's a deep topic and I'm not, I don't consider myself

1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:26.560
 super well informed about it. And AI seems to be a term that is applied to a lot of different

1:31:27.600 --> 1:31:36.240
 things. So I've messed around just a tiny little bit with neural nets with what's it called PCA,

1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:42.480
 principal component analysis. So I guess I tend to think in terms of granular bottom up

1:31:45.600 --> 1:31:49.120
 ideas rather than big picture top down.

1:31:49.120 --> 1:31:52.880
 Oh, God. So like very specific algorithms, like how are they going to,

1:31:54.400 --> 1:31:59.520
 what problem are they going to solve in society such that it has like a lot of big ripple effects?

1:31:59.520 --> 1:32:07.760
 See, I mean, we could talk a particular successful AI systems and success defining

1:32:07.760 --> 1:32:12.960
 different ways of recent years. So one is language models with GPT3.

1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:19.760
 Most importantly, they're self supervised, meaning they don't require much supervision

1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:26.400
 from humans, which means they can learn by just reading a huge amount of content created by humans.

1:32:26.400 --> 1:32:30.800
 So read the internet and from that be able to generate text and do all kinds of things like that.

1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:35.040
 It's possible they have a big enough neural network, it's going to be able to

1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:42.240
 have conversations with humans based on just reading human language. That's an interesting

1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:49.760
 idea. To me, the very interesting idea that people don't think about it as AI because they're kind

1:32:49.760 --> 1:32:57.280
 of dumb currently is actual embodied robots. So robotics like Boston Dynamics, I have downstairs

1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:07.440
 and upstairs legged robots. The currently Boston Dynamics robots and most legged robots,

1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:13.440
 most robots period are pretty dumb. Most of the challenges have to do with the actual,

1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:18.960
 first of all, the engineering of making the thing work, getting a sensor suite that allows

1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:24.560
 you to do the same things with Magic Leap, that base layer of like, where is it stuff? Where am I?

1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:34.480
 And what am I looking at? I don't need to deeply understand my surroundings at a level of like,

1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:42.560
 at a level beyond of what will hurt if I run into it. But even that is hard.

1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:51.200
 That's hard. But the thing that I think people don't in the robotics space explore enough is

1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:59.600
 the human robot interaction part of the picture, which is how it makes humans feel,

1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:03.840
 how robots make humans feel. And I think that's going to have a very significant impact

1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:12.960
 in the near future in society, which is the more you integrate AI systems of whatever form

1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:21.440
 into society where humans are in contact with them regularly. So that could be embodied robotics,

1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:25.840
 or that could be social media algorithms. I think that has a very significant impact.

1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:32.320
 And people often think like AI needs to be super smart to have an impact. I think it needs to be

1:34:32.320 --> 1:34:37.840
 super integrated with society to have an impact and more and more that's happening,

1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:47.760
 even if they're dumb. Yeah. Yeah. No, the, I mean, a lot of my exposure to robots is that I'm

1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:56.160
 associated with a combat robotics team. And I've been to a few battlebots competitions. And that's

1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:02.560
 not like, in a lot of ways, that's pretty far from the kind of robotics you're talking about,

1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:11.520
 because these robots are remote controlled. They're not autonomous. And so they're pretty simple. But

1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:19.200
 it's interesting to watch people's emotional reactions to different robots. So there was

1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:28.640
 one that was in the last year's season, the 2020 season called Rusty, that was just like put together

1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:35.040
 out of spare parts. And it looked kind of cute. And it became this huge crowd favorite. Because

1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:40.880
 you could see it was made of like salad bowls and random pieces of hardware that this guy had

1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:48.080
 like scavenged from his farm. And so immediately, people kind of fell in love with this one particular

1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:54.800
 robot. Whereas they might, other robots might be like the bad guy, you know, you know, if you

1:35:54.800 --> 1:36:02.720
 think of professional wrestling, you know, the heel and the baby face. So people do, for reasons

1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:08.000
 that are hard to understand, form these emotional reactions. And we form narratives in the same

1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:12.320
 way we do when we meet human beings, we tell stories about these objects, and they can be

1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:18.880
 intelligent, and they could be biological, or they could be in almost close to inanimate objects.

1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:26.160
 Yeah. And that to me is kind of fascinating. And if robots choose to lean into that,

1:36:27.280 --> 1:36:33.360
 it creates an interesting world. If they start using feedback loops to make themselves cuter?

1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:41.280
 Not just cuter, but everything that humans do. Let's not speak harshly of robots. Humans do

1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:47.680
 the same thing. Oh, no, I wasn't meaning it in a, but right, humans, based on feedback,

1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:52.080
 will change their appearance. Yes. I do this on Instagram all the time. How do I look cuter?

1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:57.360
 That's the fundamental question I ask myself. Yeah. So why wouldn't a robot want to,

1:36:57.360 --> 1:37:03.680
 it's like, oh, wow, people, people really don't like the quad mount machine gun, you know, on

1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:08.640
 top of my turret. Maybe I should get rid of that. And that would, you know, people would feel more

1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:16.400
 at ease. Or lean into it. Yeah. Proud of it. Yeah. Like, you won't take my gun, whatever they're

1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:24.000
 saying, instead of my dead cold hands. I mean, they're personality, adding personality,

1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:30.560
 such that you can start to heal, you can start to weave narratives. I think that's a fascinating

1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:41.840
 place where there's this feedback loop, like you said, where AI, when it's, especially when it's

1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:50.000
 embodied, puts a mirror to ourselves. Just like other humans are close friends, they kind of

1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:58.080
 teach us about ourselves. We teach each other and through that process grow close. And to me,

1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:06.720
 it's so fascinating to expand the space of deep meaningful interactions beyond just humans.

1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:16.640
 That's the opportunity I see with robots and with AI systems. And that's why I don't like

1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:23.360
 my biggest problem, social media algorithms, is the lack of transparency. It's not the existence

1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:29.440
 of the algorithms. It's, well, there's this many things. One is the data. Data should be controlled

1:38:29.440 --> 1:38:34.880
 by the individual, by people themselves. So, but also the lack of transparency and how the

1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:42.320
 algorithms work. And change your perception of what's real in hidden ways. Yeah. In hidden ways.

1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:46.880
 Like you should be aware, just like when you take, I don't know, if you take psychedelics,

1:38:47.440 --> 1:38:51.120
 you should be aware that you took the psychedelics. It shouldn't be a surprise.

1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:58.560
 Yeah. And second, you should, I mean, become a student and a scholar and there should be

1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:04.320
 research done. There should be open conversation about how your perception is changed. And then

1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:12.000
 you are, become your own guide in this world of ultra perception, because arguably none of it is

1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:22.560
 real. You get to choose the flavor of real. I mean, this is something you explore quite a bit.

1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:31.840
 Do you yourself think that there is a bottom to it where there is reality? There's a base layer

1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:39.120
 of reality that physics can explore and our human perception sort of layer stuff. Is there,

1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:43.440
 is there, let's go to Plato. Is there such a thing as truth?

1:39:44.800 --> 1:39:51.280
 I lean towards the platonic view of things. So, I believe that mathematical objects having

1:39:52.320 --> 1:40:01.520
 a reality that it's not all made up by human minds. And I don't know where that reality

1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:08.480
 comes from. I can't explain it, but I do think that mathematical objects are discovered and not

1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:22.960
 invented. I did a lot of, not a lot, but I did some reading of Husserl when I was writing Anathem.

1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:34.160
 And he's a 20th century phenomenologist and he's writing in the, he's writing at the same

1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:43.120
 time as scientists are starting to understand atoms and becoming aware that when we look at

1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:54.240
 this table, it's really just a slab of almost entirely vacuum. And there's a very sparse arrangement

1:40:54.240 --> 1:41:01.280
 of tiny, tiny little particles there occupying that space that interact with each other in such a way

1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:15.040
 that our brains perceive this object. So, that's kind of the beginnings of phenomenology. And his

1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:26.160
 stuff is pretty hard to, hard to read. You really have to take it in small bites and go a little

1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:31.840
 bit at a time. But he's trying to come to grips with these kinds of questions.

1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:38.240
 How did you come to grips with it? Why does this table feel solid?

1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:44.400
 Well, I mean, we're an evolved system that there's, we have biological advantages in knowing

1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:53.040
 where solid objects are. So, we've got this system in our head that integrates our perceptions into

1:41:53.040 --> 1:42:04.800
 this coherent view of things that one of the take homes that I like from Husserl is the idea of

1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:14.000
 intersubjectivity and the idea that a fundamental requirement for us to stay sane is for us to

1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:20.480
 share our perceptions and have them ratified by other. They don't even have to be people, but

1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:28.960
 that, you know, a prisoner in solitary confinement might domesticate a mouse or even insects

1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:39.360
 because they perceive the same things that the prisoner perceives. And so, convince him that

1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:48.000
 he's not just hallucinating. Yeah, establish a consensus. But see, that doesn't mean any of

1:42:48.000 --> 1:43:00.960
 it is real. You just establish a consensus. It could be very distant from something that's

1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:07.520
 real in the engineering sense of real, like that you could build it using physics.

1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:16.080
 Well, I think that a valuable application for an AI robot would be just to do nothing except that.

1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:27.520
 It just sits there. And if you hear a door slam, you might turn to see what it is. If the robot

1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:34.480
 at the same time turns to look at the door slam, it's ratifying your perception.

1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:39.600
 But isn't that the basis of love is when the door slams, you both look,

1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:49.200
 but for deeper things, you both hear the same music and others don't. I mean,

1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:55.200
 isn't that what that means? Yeah. That's, by love, I mean depth of human connection.

1:43:55.200 --> 1:44:02.240
 Yeah. Like, that's, or not nothing. You arrive at similar reactions without having to

1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:09.120
 explicitly communicate it. Yeah. Yeah. But we could start with a robot that

1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:15.280
 listens explicitly for the slam doors. Yeah. Or scary sounds.

1:44:15.280 --> 1:44:25.680
 I can think of. So an example of this is when I went to college, we'd be sitting at the cafeteria

1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:36.160
 a bunch of people eating our dinner together that we had just met, let's say. So a bunch of new

1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:43.040
 people in your life and someone might make a funny remark or a not so funny remark or

1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:50.480
 something would happen. And you might then, at that moment, make eye contact with someone you

1:44:50.480 --> 1:44:58.240
 didn't know at the other end of the table. And in that moment, you would realize this person

1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:04.880
 is reacting. This person heard what I heard. They're reacting the way I reacted. Yeah. Nobody

1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:11.440
 else appears to get the joke or to understand what just happened. But random stranger down there

1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:18.080
 and I, we have this connection. Yeah. And then you build on that. So then the next time something

1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:24.560
 happens, you automatically look at your new friend and they look back at you. And before you know

1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:30.960
 it, you're hanging out together. Yeah. Because you've already established, without even talking

1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:37.520
 to each other, that you're on the same wavelength. Yeah. It's seemingly so simple,

1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:43.280
 but so powerful. It's establishing that you're on the same wavelength at some level. Yeah.

1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:48.640
 There's no reason why you and a toaster can't have that. I'm just saying.

1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:57.520
 Does this smell burned to you? Exactly. I think it's burned. If a toaster could just say that to

1:45:57.520 --> 1:46:06.640
 you. Yeah. Yeah. Cryptonomicon published in 1999, set in the late 90s and involves hackers who build

1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:16.400
 essentially cryptocurrency. Bitcoin White Paper came out in 2008. So I have to kind of ask

1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:25.840
 from you looking at this layout of what's been happening in cryptocurrency, the evolution of

1:46:25.840 --> 1:46:34.640
 this technology, how has it rolled out differently than you could have imagined in two ways. One,

1:46:34.640 --> 1:46:41.360
 the technology itself and two, the human side of things, the human stories of the hackers

1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:48.480
 and the financial folks and the powerful and the powerless, the human side of things.

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:55.760
 Yeah. Well, Cryptonomicon is pre Bitcoin. It's pre Satoshi. It's pre blockchain, as you've pointed

1:46:55.760 --> 1:47:05.680
 out. So at that point, I was kind of reacting to what I was seeing among people like the Bay Area

1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:10.560
 Cypher punks in Berkeley. There was some, some there was a branch here in Austin as well.

1:47:10.560 --> 1:47:19.520
 And a lot of their thinking was so based on the idea that you would have to have

1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:29.440
 a physical region of the earth that was free of government interference. You couldn't achieve

1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:35.520
 that freedom by purely mathematical means on the network. You actually had to have

1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:44.080
 a room somewhere with servers in it that a government couldn't come and meddle with.

1:47:44.720 --> 1:47:50.880
 And so a lot of ideation happened around that view of things that there were efforts to figure

1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:56.640
 out jurisdictions where this might work. There was a lot of interest for a while in Anguilla,

1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:03.200
 which is a Caribbean island that had some unusual jurisdictional properties. There was

1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:10.880
 Sea Land, Sea Land, which is a platform in the North Sea. And so there was a lot of effort that

1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:17.760
 went into finding these physical locations that that were deemed kind of safe. And that all

1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:27.440
 goes away with blockchain. It's no longer necessary. And so that really changes the picture in a lot

1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:35.680
 of ways because you no longer have, I mean, from a novelist point of view, the old system was a lot

1:48:35.680 --> 1:48:41.760
 more fun to work with because it gives you a situation where hackers are wandering around in

1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:47.760
 strange parts of the world, you know, trying to set up server rooms. So that's a great storytelling

1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:53.920
 thing. There's still a little bit of that, right? In the modern world, but it's just

1:48:53.920 --> 1:48:57.360
 there's several server rooms as opposed to one centralized one.

1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:02.880
 Yeah. Yeah. And there is the, like the new wrinkle is the need to do a lot of computation

1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:12.160
 and to keep your GPUs from melting down. So people building things in Iceland or in

1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:19.280
 shipping containers on the bottom of the ocean or whatever. But there's still governments evolved

1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:24.720
 and there's still from a novelist perspective, interesting dynamics. What is big governments

1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:30.880
 like China and more sort of renegade governments from all over the world, trying to contend with

1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:38.720
 this idea of what to do in terms of control and power over these kinds of centers that do the

1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:46.160
 mining of the cryptocurrency. Yeah. So we're in a stage now that kind of goes beyond the initial,

1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:53.120
 like there was the stuff I was describing in Cryptonomicon had a little bit of air

1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:58.720
 about it of the underpants gnomes in that, you know, we're going to, we're going to build this

1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:05.920
 system and then we'll make money somehow. But the intermediate step was left out.

1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:17.680
 And that is, I think we're now sort of into that phase of the thing where the, where Bitcoin,

1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:24.240
 you know, blockchain exists, people know how it works. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:29.280
 exist. People are using them and it's sort of like, okay, what now, you know, where does this all

1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:36.880
 lead? So do you have a sense of where it all leads? Like, is it, is it possible that the

1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:46.400
 set of technology kind of continues to have a transformational effects on not just sort of

1:50:47.440 --> 1:50:54.480
 finance, but who gets to have power in this world? So the decentralization of power.

1:50:54.480 --> 1:51:00.400
 You know, big questions, right? So I guess there's a little bit of the cynic in me

1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:07.600
 thinking that as soon as it becomes important enough, the existing banks and people in power

1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:14.080
 are going to sort of control it. I guess an easy answer is that maybe it won't be a big change

1:51:14.080 --> 1:51:23.280
 in the end. There's a utopian strain sometimes in the way people think about this that I'm not

1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:32.960
 so sure about. There's a technological aspect to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that make it a

1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:41.280
 little easier to pull along the utopian thread. Yeah. Because it's harder for governments to

1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:49.360
 control Bitcoin. Yeah. I mean, they have much fewer options. They can ban, they can make it

1:51:49.360 --> 1:51:56.000
 illegal. It's more difficult. Yeah. So technology here is on the side of the powerless, the voiceless,

1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:00.640
 which is a very interesting idea. Of course, yes, it does have a utopian

1:52:01.440 --> 1:52:06.400
 feel to it, but we have been making progress throughout human history. Maybe this is what

1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:12.000
 progress looks like. There will be the powerful and the greedy and the bureaucrats that take

1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:18.720
 advantage of it, skim off the top kind of thing. But maybe this does give more power to people

1:52:18.720 --> 1:52:26.240
 that haven't had power before in a good way, like distributing power and enabling more

1:52:28.240 --> 1:52:33.280
 greater resistance to dictatorships and authoritarian regimes, that kind of thing,

1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:42.800
 and also enabling all kinds of technologies built on top of it. Ultimately, when you digitize money,

1:52:42.800 --> 1:52:53.600
 money is a kind of speech, or it's kind of like a mechanism of how humans interact. And if you

1:52:53.600 --> 1:53:02.000
 make that digital, more and more of the world moves to the digital space, and then you can finally

1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:08.720
 fully live in that virtual reality with the toaster. Yeah. In a lot of ways, I think in that

1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:13.760
 realm of technology that the money, per se, is one of the less interesting things you can do with

1:53:13.760 --> 1:53:20.240
 it. So I think cryptographically enforceable contracts and organizations built on those,

1:53:20.800 --> 1:53:27.680
 that seems to me like it's got more potential for change just because we do already have

1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:35.600
 money. And although it's an old system, it's been digitized to a large extent by

1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:40.160
 the stripes and the credit card companies of the world.

1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:52.080
 I also love the idea of two smart contracts connecting data, making it more formal,

1:53:52.080 --> 1:53:58.320
 it's like Mathematica, more structured, the integration of data, of weather data,

1:53:58.320 --> 1:54:07.360
 of all kinds of data about the stuff in the world so they can make contracts between people

1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:11.600
 that's grounded in data. And that's actually getting closer to

1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:18.960
 something like truth, because then you can make agreements based on actual data versus

1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:26.080
 kind of perceptions of data. And if you can formalize, distribute the power of who gets

1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:34.240
 to tell the story, that's an interesting kind of resistance, again, the powerful in the space

1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:40.880
 of narrative. Yeah, David Brinn has been saying for a while that the only way to settle arguments

1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:51.120
 with across the political divide is to make bets. So people can say the election was stolen

1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:59.360
 or whatever controversial position they're taking, and they'll keep saying it until you

1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:12.320
 wager real money on it. So maybe there's something there if you could turn that into a,

1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:20.880
 put a user interface on that thing. Yeah, have a stake in your divisiveness,

1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:28.160
 in your arguments. Will Dogecoin take over the world? Twitter question.

1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:36.160
 You know, I don't follow the different coins that much. So I hear about Dogecoin and I kind of

1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:44.960
 followed the story of it. So the interesting aspect of Dogecoin is it, so in contrast to like

1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:52.080
 Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are these serious implementations of cryptocurrency that seek

1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:58.640
 to solve some of the problems that we're talking about with smart contracts and resist the banks

1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:06.000
 and all those kinds of things, Dogecoin operates more in the space of memes and humor while still

1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:15.520
 doing some of the similar things. And it presents to the world sort of a question of whether memes,

1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:23.680
 whether humor, whether narrative will go a long way in the future,

1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:31.600
 like much farther than some kind of boring old grounded technologies,

1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:38.560
 whether we'll be playing in the space of fun. Like once we built a base of comfort and stability

1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:47.760
 and like a robust system where everyone has shelter, everyone has food and the basic needs

1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:54.320
 covered, I will go into then operate in the space of fun. That's what I think about Dogecoin,

1:56:54.320 --> 1:57:03.040
 about Dogecoin because it seems like fun spreads faster than anything else, fun of different kinds

1:57:03.040 --> 1:57:08.800
 and that could be bad fun and that could be good fun. And so it's a battle of good fun.

1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:14.160
 It goes viral very quickly when you post something that people find fun.

1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:20.000
 And that's what Dogecoin represents. So Bitcoin represents like financial,

1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:28.320
 like serious financial instruments and then Dogecoin represents fun. And it's interesting

1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:35.680
 to watch the battle go on on the internet to see which wins. This is also like an open question to

1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:44.000
 me of what is the internet because fun seems to prevail on the internet. And that's that a

1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:49.440
 fundamental property of the internet moving forward when you look 100 years out or is this

1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:54.800
 a temporary thing that was true at the birth of the internet and it's just true for a couple of

1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:59.840
 decades until it fades away and the adults take over and become serious again.

1:57:59.840 --> 1:58:05.440
 Well, I think the adults took over initially and then it was later on that people started

1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:12.240
 using it for fun, frivolous things like memes. And I think that's pretty much unstoppable.

1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:23.360
 Yeah. Because even people who are very serious enjoy sending around a funny picture or

1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:31.040
 something that amuses them. Yeah, I personally think we spoke about World War II. I think memes

1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:37.440
 will save the world and prevent all future wars. You've been handwriting your work for

1:58:37.440 --> 1:58:43.040
 the past 20 years since writing the Baroque cycle. What are the pros and cons of handwriting versus

1:58:43.040 --> 1:58:49.680
 typing? For me, I started it as an experiment when I started the Baroque cycle because I had noticed

1:58:49.680 --> 1:58:55.120
 that sometimes if I was stuck having a hard time getting started, if I just picked up a pen

1:58:55.680 --> 1:59:04.960
 and started writing, it was easy to go. So I just decided to keep with that. If it got in my way,

1:59:04.960 --> 1:59:10.560
 I didn't like it. I could always just go back to the word processor and be fine. But that never

1:59:10.560 --> 1:59:17.040
 happened. So there's a certain security that comes from knowing that it's ink on paper and there's no

1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:29.760
 operating system crash or software failure that can obliterate it. It's a slower output

1:59:29.760 --> 1:59:38.320
 technique. And so a sentence or a paragraph spends a longer time in the buffer up here

1:59:38.880 --> 1:59:46.000
 before it gets committed to paper, whereas I can type really fast. And so I can slam things out

1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:52.000
 before I really thought them through. So I think the first draft quality ends up being higher.

1:59:52.000 --> 2:00:01.680
 And then editing, first draft of editing is just faster because instead of trying to move the cursor

2:00:01.680 --> 2:00:09.200
 around or whatever, or hitting the backspace key, I can just draw a line through a word or a sentence

2:00:09.200 --> 2:00:17.040
 or just around a whole paragraph and exit out. And in doing so, I very quickly created an edit,

2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:22.480
 but I've also left behind a record of what the text was prior to the edit. Of course,

2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:29.280
 all the digital versions have those quote unquote features, but their experience is different.

2:00:31.040 --> 2:00:34.480
 Is there a romance to just the physical,

2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:43.920
 the touch of the pen to the paper, doing what has been done for centuries? I think there is.

2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:51.840
 I think there is just the simplicity of it and not having any intermediary technology beyond the

2:00:51.840 --> 2:01:04.320
 pen and the paper is just very simple and clean. And so I've got a bunch of fountain pens. I started

2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:11.520
 buying fancy paper from Italy a few years ago because I thought I would be more conservative

2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:22.320
 with it. But it's still a trivial expenditure, so it doesn't really alter my habits very much.

2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:32.880
 So all that said, once you do type stuff up, you use Emacs. I use Emacs, obviously the superior

2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:39.600
 editor. Of course. Let me just ask the ridiculous futuristic question because Emacs has been around

2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:52.320
 forever. Do you think in 100 years we will still have Emacs and Vim? Or pick a, let's say, 50,

2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:57.360
 100 years. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I mean, whenever you're doing anything in Linux,

2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:05.280
 you're spending a lot of time editing little config files and scripts and stuff. And you need

2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:13.040
 to be able to pop in and out of editing those things. And it needs to work. Like even if the

2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:21.200
 windowing GUI is dead and all you've got is like a command line, to get out of that problem, you

2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:29.840
 might need to enter an editor and alter a file. So I think on that level, there will always have to

2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:37.280
 be sort of very simple. Well, Emacs isn't very simple, but you know what I mean. There have to

2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:45.760
 be basic editors that you can use from either the command line or a GUI just for administering

2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:55.440
 systems. Now, how widespread they'll be. There's a certain amount of what's the story of the

2:02:55.440 --> 2:03:05.360
 American folktale of the hammer guy who drives the railroad spikes, John Henry,

2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:12.000
 trying to keep up with the steam hammer. And eventually the steam hammer wins because he

2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:18.880
 can't drive the spikes fast enough. So there's a sense in which, you know, Microsoft, like

2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:29.840
 who knows how much they've invested in code, you know, Visual Studio or Apple with Xcode. So

2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:38.960
 they've put huge amounts of money into enhancing their IDEs. And Emacs, in theory, can duplicate

2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:47.440
 all of those features by, you know, if you just have enough Linux hackers writing Emacs Lisp

2:03:47.440 --> 2:03:57.600
 macros. But, you know, at some point, it's going to be hard to maintain that level of

2:04:00.240 --> 2:04:05.600
 to keep up feature for feature. The interesting thing about Emacs just is

2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:12.640
 lasted a long time. Yeah. And I think you've talked about, there's a certain like, there's certain

2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:22.560
 fads, certainly in the software engineering space. And it's interesting to think about

2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:29.840
 technologies that sort of last for a very long time. And just kind of being in them.

2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:39.200
 What is it? How do they get by? It's like the cockroaches of software or the bacteria or

2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:43.840
 software or something. Like this base thing that nobody, everybody's just became reliant on.

2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:51.280
 And they just outlast everything else and slowly, slowly adjust with the times with a little bit

2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:57.280
 of a delay with a little bit of customization by individuals kind of that. But they're always

2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:03.360
 there in the shadows and they outlast everybody else. And I wonder if that's, that might be the

2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:07.760
 story for a lot of technologies, especially in the software space. Shell scripts, you know,

2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:14.400
 all that stuff. You can't run the modern world without a bunch of shell scripts,

2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:24.640
 you know, booting up machines and running things. So that is going to be a hard thing to replace.

2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:28.080
 And then tech for typesetting that you use, you said?

2:05:28.960 --> 2:05:35.280
 For, when I want to print it out, yeah, I just have some simple macros that I use. But then I

2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:44.960
 have to, the publisher put their foot down and they want it in Word format now. So years ago,

2:05:44.960 --> 2:05:52.000
 I wrote some macros to convert. And this time, what did I do?

2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:52.720
 Copy, paste.

2:05:53.360 --> 2:06:02.160
 No, I used sort of regular expressions. So I was to do italics and, you know, you put it in

2:06:02.160 --> 2:06:07.200
 curly brackets and you do backslash it and then you type what you want to type. And that's how

2:06:07.200 --> 2:06:15.040
 you get italics in tech. So you can create a regular expression that'll look for some text

2:06:15.040 --> 2:06:24.560
 between curly brackets preceded by backslash it and then instead convert that to italics.

2:06:24.560 --> 2:06:32.560
 And Word will do that. Word, if you go deep enough into its search and replace UI.

2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:33.760
 You can do regular expressions.

2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:35.040
 It's just regs.

2:06:36.480 --> 2:06:41.040
 Yeah, it's funny that you did that. I mean, I'm sure there's tools that help you with that kind

2:06:41.040 --> 2:06:50.080
 of thing, but the task is sufficiently simple to where you can do a much better job than anybody

2:06:50.080 --> 2:06:56.480
 else's tool can. Yeah. So that's a fascinating process. Works fine for me. Yeah. And it keeps

2:06:56.480 --> 2:07:02.560
 you from messing around with formatting. Yeah. Like, oh, what if I put this chapter heading,

2:07:02.560 --> 2:07:09.520
 you know, in, you know, a sans serif font? Yeah, it's just classic wanking. And so

2:07:12.560 --> 2:07:15.120
 those options are closed off in what I'm doing.

2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:20.080
 Is there advice you could say, what does it take to write a great story?

2:07:20.800 --> 2:07:28.800
 The power of good yarns, good narratives to pull people in is incredible. And I think my

2:07:29.360 --> 2:07:36.000
 sort of amateur theory is that it's an evolutionary development that if you're,

2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:45.840
 you know, a cave person sitting around a fire in the Rift Valley a million years ago,

2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:58.800
 if you can tell the story of how you escaped from the hyenas or how Uncle Bob, you know,

2:07:58.800 --> 2:08:03.520
 didn't escape from the hyenas. And if the people listening to you can take that in

2:08:03.520 --> 2:08:09.760
 and they can build that scenario in their heads like a kind of virtual reality and see

2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:16.880
 what you're describing, then you've just conferred an incredibly important advantage

2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:22.720
 on the people who've heard that story. Yeah. Right. And so they know a bunch of stuff now

2:08:22.720 --> 2:08:27.520
 about how to stay alive that they could not have learned in any other way.

2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:33.520
 I mean, animals who don't have speech though, they might warn each other,

2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:42.000
 they might make a sound that says danger, danger. But as far as we know, they can't

2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:50.640
 tell more complicated stories. So it's a part of us. Yeah. The collective intelligence seems

2:08:50.640 --> 2:08:57.360
 to be one of the key characteristics of Homo sapiens, the ability to share ideas and hold

2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:02.400
 ideas together in our minds. And storytelling is the fundamental aspect of that. Maybe even

2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:08.480
 language itself is more fundamental. Yeah. Because the language is required to do the

2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:14.560
 storytelling or maybe they evolve together. Maybe they co evolve. Yeah. So I think that

2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:21.680
 you've got to work with that. And I think sometimes it seems like in kind of literary

2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:29.760
 circles that having a lot of plot is a little bit frowned upon as it's pulpy or it's exploitative.

2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:36.880
 But for me, I don't have any compunctions whatsoever about that. I like stories that

2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:43.200
 are grabby and fun and exciting to read. And once you've got one of those going,

2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:48.720
 once you've got a good yarn going that people will enjoy reading, then you're free to do whatever

2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:56.080
 you want in the frame of that story. But if you don't have that, then you got nothing.

2:09:57.040 --> 2:10:02.320
 What about having like, which you do at the technological scientific rigor,

2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:10.000
 like to the accuracy and as much as possible? How does that add to Bob telling the story

2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:14.720
 or telling the story about Bob or on the campfire? Well, the main thing that it does is

2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:23.920
 present little details that you might not have come up with on your own. So if you're just sitting

2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:33.360
 there freely imagining things, your brain probably isn't going to serve up the wealth

2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:41.520
 of details and the resulting complications and surprises that the real world is constantly

2:10:41.520 --> 2:10:50.240
 presenting us with. And so in my case, if I'm trying to write a story about that involves

2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:58.000
 some technology like a rocket or orbital maneuvers or whatever, then delving into those details

2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:05.280
 eventually is going to turn up some weird, unexpected thing that gives me material to work

2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:12.400
 with, but also subliminally readers who see that are going to be drawn in more,

2:11:13.200 --> 2:11:20.720
 because they're going to find that, oh, I didn't see that coming. It's got some

2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:25.600
 of the complexity and surprise value of the real world. Yeah, it does something.

2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:36.480
 Alex Garland, director who wrote, directed X Machina, I think about AI movies and the more

2:11:36.480 --> 2:11:43.040
 care you take in making it accurate, the more compelling the story becomes a mile.

2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:51.440
 I'm not sure what that is. Maybe because it becomes more real to the people writing the story,

2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:56.800
 maybe it just makes you a better writer. The key to any storytelling is getting the

2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:02.720
 readers to suspend their disbelief. And there's all kinds of triggers and little

2:12:02.720 --> 2:12:08.480
 tells that can break that. And once it's broken, it's really hard to get it back.

2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:15.200
 A lot of times that's the end. Somebody will just close the book and not pick it up.

2:12:15.200 --> 2:12:22.880
 I got to ask you, you've answered this question, but I got to ask you the most impossible question

2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:28.880
 for an author to answer, but which Neil Stevenson book should one read first?

2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:35.920
 So when people ask me that, I usually ask them what they like to read, right? Because I mean,

2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:43.280
 there's the best known one is probably Snow Crash, but that's a cyberpunk novel that's

2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:51.280
 at the same time making fun of cyberpunk. So it's got some layers to it that might not

2:12:52.080 --> 2:13:02.480
 seem so funny if you don't get the joke, right? So as you point out, I've written historical

2:13:02.480 --> 2:13:07.840
 novels. Some people like those. Some people prefer those. So if that's what you like,

2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:14.160
 then kryptonomicon or the Baroque cycle is where you would start. If you like sort of techno

2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:21.840
 thrillers that are set in a modern day setting, but aren't science fictiony per se, then Reemdi

2:13:23.760 --> 2:13:32.080
 is one of those and termination shock is definitely one of those. So it just depends on

2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:40.960
 what people like. When people a long time ago recommend I read Snow Crash, I said

2:13:42.720 --> 2:13:51.920
 it's Neil Stevenson Light. It's the like, if you don't want to be overwhelmed by the depth,

2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:58.480
 like the rigor book, like that's a good introduction to the man. So essentially,

2:13:58.480 --> 2:14:06.080
 you're broken down by topics, but if you wanted to read all of them, what's a good introduction

2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:11.520
 to the man? Because obviously, these worlds are very different. The philosophies are very different.

2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:19.520
 What's a good introduction to the human? People ask the same thing of Dostoyevsky people,

2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:29.440
 right? It's a hard one to answer. Maybe Seven Eves, because it's got big themes. It's about heavy

2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:37.600
 things happening to the human race. But hopefully the story is told through a cast of characters

2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:47.520
 that people can relate to. It moves along. So it does go kind of deep eventually on

2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:54.160
 how rockets work and orbital mechanics and all that stuff. But people were able to get through

2:14:54.160 --> 2:15:01.920
 it anyway, or some people just skip over that. It's fine. As an author, let me ask you,

2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:08.480
 what books had a big impact on your life that you've read? Is there any that jumped to mind

2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:15.200
 that you learned from as a writer, as a philosopher, as a mathematician, as an engineer?

2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:21.600
 This is one of these questions where I always blank out. And then when I'm walking out the door,

2:15:22.800 --> 2:15:28.400
 I'll remember 12. So this is a random selection that doesn't represent the top ones?

2:15:29.920 --> 2:15:35.120
 Well, I mentioned Gulag Archipelago. That's kind of hefty and dark.

2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:40.960
 And then it has a personal connection as well. Like where you found the book, too.

2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:46.640
 The time in your life, where you found it, who recommended it, that's also part of the story.

2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:51.680
 Yeah. So there's definitely that. I circle back to Moby Dick a lot,

2:15:53.600 --> 2:16:00.640
 because we read it in a really great English class I had in high school. And I came in with an

2:16:00.640 --> 2:16:06.160
 oppositional stance because I thought that the teacher was going to try to talk me into

2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:12.480
 having all kinds of highfalutin ideas about allegory and what does this mean and what's

2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:21.120
 the symbolism. And it turned out that it turned out to be a lot more interesting and satisfying than

2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:28.480
 that. What was the first powerful book you remember reading that convinced you that

2:16:29.680 --> 2:16:35.600
 this form could have depth? Was it Moby Dick? Was it like in high school?

2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:41.760
 I'm trying to remember. Well, Moby Dick was definitely a big one. I used to read a lot of

2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:50.480
 classics, comics. I don't know if you've seen these. It's a whole series of comic books that

2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:59.280
 it was viral. In the back of each comic book was an order form. You could check some boxes and

2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:06.000
 fill out your address and mail it in and more would show up. But it was like they would do the

2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:14.880
 count of Monte Cristo, Moby Dick, Robert Louis Stevenson, Robinson Crusoe, all the sort of classic

2:17:14.880 --> 2:17:22.640
 books they had put into comic book form. That's amazing. Yeah. Reading Moby Dick,

2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:30.400
 if you're nine years old, is a tall order. There's some very complicated sentences in there and a

2:17:30.400 --> 2:17:34.800
 lot of digressions. But if you're just looking at the comic book, it's like, holy shit, look at that

2:17:34.800 --> 2:17:45.360
 whale. And ultimately the power of the story doesn't need the complicated words. It's all

2:17:45.360 --> 2:17:51.680
 about the man and the whale. Yeah. So you could get kind of a grounding in a lot of classic works

2:17:51.680 --> 2:17:56.560
 of literature without actually reading them, which is great when you're nine years old.

2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:03.120
 So I read a lot of that stuff for sure. The annotated Sherlock Holmes.

2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:11.040
 You mentioned David Deutsch, too, as an inspiration for some of your work. I mean, you've

2:18:11.040 --> 2:18:16.240
 obviously done really a lot of research for the books you do. Roger Penrose.

2:18:16.240 --> 2:18:23.200
 What, do you remember a book that made you want to become a writer? Or a moment that made you

2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:30.560
 become a writer? I think like the, you know, the answer I usually give is that when I was in like

2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:39.040
 fifth grade, one of my friends came to school one day is wearing leather shoes, like dress shoes.

2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:46.480
 And I hated dress shoes because mine never fit. And so they were uncomfortable. I couldn't run,

2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:55.360
 you know, they were cold. It was Iowa. So I kind of said, I remember very clearly thinking,

2:18:55.360 --> 2:19:02.160
 okay, I don't like where this is going. Like, does this mean that next year,

2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:10.160
 all of the kids are going to be wearing leather shoes? So I need to find a job where I don't

2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:17.440
 have to do that. So that was like the first time I thought about trying to find such a job,

2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:24.560
 you know, being a writer. And then I just read a lot of just classic science fiction short stories

2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:30.000
 and started, you know, trying to write some of my own. And there were just classic young adult

2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:38.560
 stories like by Heinlein and the other classic names that you think of, but the Heinlein ones

2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:44.400
 have stuck with me in a way that the others didn't. What's the greatest science fiction book ever

2:19:44.400 --> 2:19:55.920
 written? Removing your work from consideration? Greatest? I'm loving torturing you right now.

2:19:55.920 --> 2:20:01.760
 Greatest ever non Stevenson? Do we include fantasy? There's to have to be science fiction.

2:20:02.560 --> 2:20:09.200
 Oh, interesting fantasy. I do not expect that twist.

2:20:10.080 --> 2:20:13.680
 Well, in a weird way, they're lumped together in people's minds, right? So

2:20:14.160 --> 2:20:20.080
 they are, but there's also a boundary somehow. I'm not sure what that is exactly.

2:20:20.080 --> 2:20:26.320
 Nobody is. It's a mystery. So I mean, if we do include it, then it's easily the Lord of the

2:20:26.320 --> 2:20:39.360
 Rings. But I mean, greatness is an interesting quality to try to define. And for me, a lot of the

2:20:39.360 --> 2:20:45.600
 fun and the joy of such books is not in what you call greatness, but just storytelling.

2:20:45.600 --> 2:20:53.840
 And so I was always a big fan of have space suit will travel, which is a Heinlein young adult book.

2:20:53.840 --> 2:21:02.240
 It's just a fun, good read. So fun is a big component. Greatness is overrated.

2:21:02.240 --> 2:21:08.160
 Well, I don't know it's overrated, but it's just, you know, it might be under defined.

2:21:08.160 --> 2:21:13.440
 Let's put it that way. Have space suit will travel. Now I definitely have to read that one.

2:21:13.440 --> 2:21:20.320
 Yeah. You mentioned Iowa. I was there a couple of times that got to spend quite a bit of time

2:21:20.320 --> 2:21:29.920
 with Dan Gable, with Tom Brands, who are wrestlers. Is it now wrestling martial arts

2:21:29.920 --> 2:21:34.400
 part of your life, any part of your form, formation of who you are as a human being?

2:21:34.400 --> 2:21:46.880
 I think so. It was a late thing for me, but growing up in Ames, Dan Gable was a few years

2:21:46.880 --> 2:21:52.480
 older than me. And so sometimes we would go to the arena at the university and watch wrestling

2:21:53.040 --> 2:22:01.680
 meets. And this was before his Olympic career. So everyone knew he was the star of that team.

2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:06.720
 And then he was the best. But people didn't yet know that he was the greatest of all time.

2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:13.280
 Gee, you saw Gable. So that was part, it's, it's funny as it feels like a small world that you

2:22:13.280 --> 2:22:19.920
 would be in the same space as Dan Gable. Well, from 100 feet away, a little dot on the mat,

2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:27.520
 trouncing his opponents, him and Chris Taylor. So the other star was this 400 pound plus guy

2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:35.440
 named Chris Taylor, who also went to the Olympics. So yeah, people, you know, he was, he was a no,

2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:44.000
 he was a athletic hero. And wrestling is, there's certain states like Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,

2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:49.680
 Iowa, where wrestling is the sport, because those are states of small towns. And so if you're a

2:22:49.680 --> 2:22:58.400
 small town, if you're like Dan Gable, and you have to be on a football team with 20 other guys

2:22:58.400 --> 2:23:06.640
 who are not Dan Gable, then no matter how good you are, your team might, might suck. But if in a

2:23:06.640 --> 2:23:14.640
 solo thing, you can, you can go to the Olympics. So we did a lot of wrestling in our gym classes

2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:20.560
 in school, and I didn't like it. And I think partly it's just that it was so, so competitive.

2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:27.120
 And the people who were, who cared about it, really cared about it a lot, you know. And so

2:23:27.120 --> 2:23:32.000
 it was, it was pretty tough. I didn't think I had the right body type. But then when I was,

2:23:32.800 --> 2:23:37.200
 after college, I was in Iowa City for a few years, when he was coaching the,

2:23:37.200 --> 2:23:45.360
 that the wrestling team there, and he won like nine championships out of 10 years, you know,

2:23:45.360 --> 2:23:50.480
 during that, during that time. So he was both the greatest individual wrestler of all time,

2:23:50.480 --> 2:23:57.600
 and like the greatest team coach. So I know I've never met him, but we've,

2:24:00.320 --> 2:24:04.640
 he's kind of been like in my sphere of awareness since I was, you know, kind of my whole life.

2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:10.720
 And people would always tell stories about him. Like, I think he got arrested once for some kind of,

2:24:12.480 --> 2:24:17.760
 I don't know, minor offense and aims. And so he just basically stayed up all night. He was in

2:24:17.760 --> 2:24:24.400
 this cage in the jail. He just stayed up all night doing pull ups. Yeah. Sounds about right. Yeah.

2:24:24.400 --> 2:24:34.720
 And so yeah. So has that been, I mean, Iowa is such an interesting place in the world.

2:24:34.720 --> 2:24:43.280
 And wrestling is just part of that story. Is that somewhere in there? Does that resonate deeply

2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:49.280
 with who you are? It was a formative thing for me growing up there, for sure. It's just a,

2:24:49.280 --> 2:25:00.400
 you know, at least used to be a very orderly place, high social capital, very minimal class

2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:06.160
 differences. So like, you'd have some people who would drive a Cadillac instead of a Chevy,

2:25:06.880 --> 2:25:15.440
 but that was it. Those were the rich people, right? So and a college town is always a different

2:25:15.440 --> 2:25:24.960
 environment like, you know, Austin has some of this. So it was a pretty kind of utopian,

2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:33.040
 other than the weather and a few other things, environment to grow up in. The martial art I

2:25:33.040 --> 2:25:39.600
 ended up doing is sword stuff, which is interesting because it uses a different feedback loop. So

2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:48.000
 when you're grappling, everything is through sense of touch. And your sense of touch is very old

2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:55.840
 and simple, right? Like earthworms don't even have eyes, but they can tell when they're being

2:25:55.840 --> 2:26:08.080
 touched, right? So it's very fast. And with a standoff art like boxing or some kinds of sword

2:26:08.080 --> 2:26:15.680
 fighting, you're not touching the other person most of the time. Your visual system is doing

2:26:15.680 --> 2:26:22.000
 something way more, it's doing slam and trying to figure out what the other person is up to.

2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:30.800
 And so that always fell more my speed. So in Olympic style fencing,

2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:38.480
 it doesn't start really until you're crossing blades with the other person. And now you're back

2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:45.200
 to wrestling, you're feeling what they're doing. And it's all about that. But some of the older

2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:52.000
 sword arts don't engage the blade that way. You standoff at a range and then you make

2:26:52.000 --> 2:27:05.360
 cutting attacks. And so those are all processed visually. And I think I'm more of a slow thinker,

2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:12.960
 so it works for me better. I mean, it has the same, the artistry and the beauty of boxing,

2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:17.920
 I suppose, just like you said, is like there's no, there's no contact and it's all processed

2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:24.080
 visually. And I'm sure there's a dance of its own. That depends on the characteristic of a sword

2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:31.360
 involved. Yeah, there's a set of stances and basic reactions that you try to learn that are

2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:40.160
 thought to be defensible and safe or safer. And so it tends to be a series of short engagements

2:27:40.160 --> 2:27:47.600
 where you'll, you'll close in, you'll try out your, your idea and it works where it doesn't, then you,

2:27:47.600 --> 2:27:54.080
 you back off again. It's interesting to think about like human history, because martial arts,

2:27:54.800 --> 2:28:01.040
 okay, that's a thing. But in terms of sword fighting, just the full

2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:09.680
 range of humans that existed who mastered sword fighting or sought the master sword fighting,

2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:15.600
 just to imagine the thousands of people who, the heights they have achieved, because the stakes

2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:23.680
 are so incredibly high to be good. And it's the richest, most powerful people in those societies

2:28:24.320 --> 2:28:31.840
 spending whatever it takes to get the best gear and the best training, because you're right,

2:28:31.840 --> 2:28:36.320
 everything depends on it. And it's still life and death. I mean, that, that's fascinating.

2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:45.440
 I mean, that, that's fascinating. We perhaps have lost that forever with greater weapons.

2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:51.360
 I mean, the artistry of sword fighting, when it's life and death, and you go into war,

2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:57.760
 you have the Miyamoto Massaches of the world, right? The, I don't know, there's a, there's a

2:28:57.760 --> 2:29:03.280
 poetry to that, that there's a mastery to that, that I don't know if we could achieve with any

2:29:03.280 --> 2:29:10.080
 other kind of martial art. Well, the, one of the good, you were talking earlier about the,

2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:17.200
 the good effects of the internet social media that we sometimes overlook. And, and one of those is

2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:22.320
 that there were all these isolated people around the world who were interested in this, who found

2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:28.800
 each other and kind of created a network of, of people who help each other learn these things.

2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:34.880
 So that doesn't mean that anyone is, is up to the level of the, you're talking about yet. But,

2:29:36.160 --> 2:29:45.200
 but it is happening. And, and so there's a, a, a large number of old treatises, old written

2:29:45.920 --> 2:29:51.280
 documents that have been dug up from libraries and, and people have been going over these and

2:29:51.280 --> 2:29:59.680
 translating them from old dialects of Italian and German to make sense of them and, and learning

2:29:59.680 --> 2:30:08.000
 how to, to do these techniques with different, different weapons. Actually, there's a guy here

2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:16.000
 in Austin named Daman Stith who does African, historical African martial arts. Also martial

2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:24.560
 arts of, of enslaved Africans who would learn machete fighting techniques in the Caribbean

2:30:24.560 --> 2:30:30.400
 South America. He's probably within a mile of us. He's an amazing guy. I'm going to look him up.

2:30:31.680 --> 2:30:38.240
 Can I ask you for advice? Can you give advice for young people, high school, college,

2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:45.520
 you know, undergrads, thinking about their career, thinking about life, how to live a

2:30:45.520 --> 2:30:51.680
 life that you'd be proud of. You think quite a bit about like what it's required to be

2:30:51.680 --> 2:30:56.080
 innovative in this world. You think quite a bit about the future. So if somebody wanted to be

2:30:56.800 --> 2:31:01.360
 a person that makes a big impact from the future, what advice would you give them?

2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:07.360
 I think a big part of it is finding the thing that you will do

2:31:07.360 --> 2:31:16.160
 happily. And I don't want to say obsessively, because that sounds like maybe it's pathological,

2:31:16.160 --> 2:31:21.600
 but, but if you can find a thing that you'll, you know, you'll sit down, you'll start doing it,

2:31:21.600 --> 2:31:30.960
 and hours later, you kind of snap out of it. Now, where did the time go? Then that's a really key

2:31:30.960 --> 2:31:38.320
 discovery for anyone to make about themselves when they're young. Because if you don't have that,

2:31:39.920 --> 2:31:46.320
 it's hard to, to figure out where you should put your energies, you know. And as you might have

2:31:46.320 --> 2:31:55.600
 the best intentions, you might say, you know, I want world peace or whatever. But at the end of

2:31:55.600 --> 2:32:01.680
 the day, what really matters is how do you spend your time? And are you spending it in a way that

2:32:01.680 --> 2:32:10.720
 it's productive? And because it doesn't matter how smart you are or well intentioned you are,

2:32:10.720 --> 2:32:16.160
 unless you've figured that out. And so finding the thing in which you can sort of,

2:32:16.160 --> 2:32:25.120
 you naturally lose yourself in. The thing is, at least for me, there's a lot of things like that,

2:32:25.120 --> 2:32:32.240
 but I first have to overcome the initial hump of really sucking at that thing. Like the fun starts

2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:37.280
 a little bit after the first hump of really sucking, and then you could suck just regularly.

2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:43.120
 Yeah. So often, people, oftentimes people can give up too early, I think. I mean,

2:32:43.120 --> 2:32:48.640
 that's true with mathematics for me. It's for a lot of people is if you just give it a chance

2:32:48.640 --> 2:32:54.800
 of struggle, if you give yourself time to struggle, you'll find a way, you'll find the thing

2:32:54.800 --> 2:33:01.360
 within that thing that you can lose track of time with. Yeah, that's a key detail that

2:33:03.120 --> 2:33:09.200
 there's an important thing to add to what I said, which is that this might not happen the first time

2:33:09.200 --> 2:33:16.240
 you do a thing. Maybe it will. But you might have to climb that learning curve. And

2:33:17.360 --> 2:33:20.800
 if there's pressures in your life that are making you feel bad about that,

2:33:20.800 --> 2:33:31.920
 then it might prevent you from getting where you need to be. So there's some complexity there

2:33:33.040 --> 2:33:41.360
 that can make this kind of nonobvious. But that's why we need good teachers.

2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:50.320
 You know, another beneficial thing of the internet is YouTube and being able to learn

2:33:50.320 --> 2:33:57.280
 things, how to do things on YouTube. The dude who made the YouTube video doesn't care how many

2:33:57.280 --> 2:34:06.320
 times you hit pause and rewind. They're never going to roll their eyes and be impatient with you.

2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:16.000
 And sometimes spending a huge amount of time on one video or one book, like making that

2:34:16.800 --> 2:34:21.120
 the thing you just spent a huge amount of time on rereading, rereading, or rewatching,

2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:31.040
 rewatching, that somehow really solidifies your love for that thing. And the depth of

2:34:31.040 --> 2:34:35.520
 understanding you start to gain. And it's okay to stay with that. I used to think there's all

2:34:35.520 --> 2:34:41.760
 these books out there. So like, I need to keep reading or keep reading. But then I realized,

2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:49.520
 I think it was somewhere in college where you could just spend your whole life with a single

2:34:49.520 --> 2:34:55.120
 textbook. There's nothing in that textbook to really, really stay.

2:34:55.120 --> 2:35:01.920
 Miesner, Thorn and Wheeler, Gravitation is one of those. Or another one is The Road to Reality

2:35:01.920 --> 2:35:08.320
 by Roger Penrose, which is just incredibly deep. And it starts with like two plus two equals four.

2:35:08.320 --> 2:35:16.160
 And at the end, you're at the boundaries of physics. It's an amazing, amazing book.

2:35:17.360 --> 2:35:23.040
 Let me ask you the big, ridiculous question. Since you've pondered some big, ridiculous

2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:28.320
 questions in your work, what's the meaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life,

2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:37.280
 a human life? Well, as far as I know, we're unique in the universe.

2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:42.240
 There's no evidence that there's anything else in the universe that's as complicated as what's

2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:51.520
 between our ears might be. You can't rule it out. So we appear to be pretty special. And

2:35:51.520 --> 2:35:58.480
 so it's got to have something to do with that. And one of the reasons I like David Deutch,

2:35:59.280 --> 2:36:04.800
 in particular, his book, The Beginning of Infinity, is that he talks about the power of

2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:14.160
 explanations and the fact that most civilizations are static, that they've got a set of dogmas

2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:22.400
 that they arrive at somehow, and they just pass those on from one generation to the next and

2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:31.040
 nothing changes. But that huge changes have happened when people sort of follow whatever

2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:37.600
 you want to call it, the scientific method or enlightenment. There's different ways of thinking

2:36:37.600 --> 2:36:45.920
 about it, but basically, explanatory, it's about the power of explanations and being able to figure

2:36:45.920 --> 2:36:53.840
 out why things are the way they are. And that has created changes in our thinking and our way of life

2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:59.760
 over the last few centuries that are explosive compared to anything that came before.

2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:08.160
 And David sort of verges on classifying this as like a force of nature in its potential

2:37:08.160 --> 2:37:18.400
 transformative power. If we keep going, if we figure out how to colonize the universe,

2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:25.360
 like you were talking about earlier, how to spread to other star systems, then it is

2:37:25.360 --> 2:37:32.240
 effectively a force of nature. This kind of drive to understand more and more and more deeper and

2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:38.480
 deeper and deeper and to engineer stuff so that we can understand even more. Yeah. Yeah. It's the

2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:45.360
 well, it's the old, the universe created us to understand itself. Maybe that's the whole purpose.

2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:54.160
 Yeah. It is an interesting peculiar side effect of the way we've been created is we seem to be

2:37:54.160 --> 2:38:01.360
 conscious beings. We seem to have little egos. We seem to be born and die pretty quickly. There's a

2:38:01.360 --> 2:38:08.400
 bunch of drama. We're all within ourselves pretty unique and we fall in love and start wars and

2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:13.680
 there's hate and all the, the full interesting dynamic of it. So it's not just about the individual

2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:22.480
 people. Yeah. Somehow like the concert that we played together. Yeah. Yeah. So that's kind of

2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:27.600
 interesting. And there's a lot of peculiar aspects of that that I wonder if they're fundamental,

2:38:27.600 --> 2:38:33.200
 just quirks of evolution, whether it's, whether there's death, whether it's love, whether all

2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:39.760
 those things. I wonder if they're, from an engineering perspective, when we're trying to create

2:38:39.760 --> 2:38:48.320
 that intelligent toaster that listens for the, for the slam door and the smell of burning toasts,

2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:57.520
 whether that toaster, it should be afraid of death and should fall in love just like we do.

2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:03.040
 Neil, you're a fascinating human being. You've impacted the lives of millions of people.

2:39:03.680 --> 2:39:07.840
 Well, thank you. It is a huge honor that you would spend your valuable time with me today.

2:39:07.840 --> 2:39:14.560
 Thank you so much. Thank you for coming down to beautiful hot Texas and thank you for talking

2:39:14.560 --> 2:39:20.240
 to me. It was a pleasure. I'm glad I came and did it. Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:25.280
 with Neil Stevenson. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:31.200
 And now let me leave you with some words from Neil Stevenson himself in his novel, Snow Crash.

2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:37.680
 The world is full of things more powerful than us. But if you know how to catch a ride,

2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:45.680
 you can go places. Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
