00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
 The following is a conversation with David Sinclair.

00:02.760 --> 00:06.200
 He's a professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard

00:06.200 --> 00:08.960
 and codirector of the Paul F. Glenn Center

00:08.960 --> 00:12.280
 for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.280
 He's the author of the book,

00:13.280 --> 00:16.880
 Lifespan and cofounder of several biotech companies.

00:16.880 --> 00:20.800
 He works on turning age into an engineering problem

00:20.800 --> 00:22.160
 and solving it.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.800
 Driven by a vision of a world where billions of people

00:24.800 --> 00:28.160
 can live much longer and much healthier lives.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.360
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:30.360 --> 00:34.400
 On It, Clear, National Instruments and I,

00:34.400 --> 00:36.840
 Simply Safe and Linode.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.200
 Check them out in the description

00:38.200 --> 00:40.040
 to support this podcast.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.800
 As a side note, let me say that legivity research

00:42.800 --> 00:45.880
 challenges us to think how science and engineering

00:45.880 --> 00:47.640
 will change society.

00:47.640 --> 00:50.400
 Imagine if we can live 100,000 years,

00:50.400 --> 00:53.720
 even under controlled conditions like in a spaceship, say,

00:53.720 --> 00:55.960
 then suddenly a trip to Alpha Centauri

00:55.960 --> 01:00.960
 that is 4.37 light years away takes a single human lifespan.

01:01.280 --> 01:05.160
 And on the psychological, maybe even philosophical level,

01:05.160 --> 01:08.720
 as the horizons of death drift farther into the distance,

01:08.720 --> 01:11.120
 how will our search for meaning change?

01:11.120 --> 01:13.080
 Does meaning require death

01:13.080 --> 01:15.720
 or does it merely require struggle?

01:15.720 --> 01:19.440
 Reprogramming our biology will require us to delve deeper

01:19.440 --> 01:23.680
 into understanding the human mind and the robot mind.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.880
 Both of these efforts are as exciting

01:25.880 --> 01:28.160
 of a journey as I can imagine.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.320
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

01:30.320 --> 01:33.400
 and here is my conversation with David Sinclair.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.320
 I usually feel like the same person when I was 12,

01:38.320 --> 01:42.480
 like when I, right now, as I think about myself,

01:42.480 --> 01:45.040
 I feel like exactly the same person

01:45.040 --> 01:46.360
 that I was when I was 12.

01:46.360 --> 01:51.360
 And yet, I am getting older, both body and mind,

01:52.040 --> 01:54.280
 and still feel like time hasn't passed at all.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.960
 Do you feel this tension in yourself

01:56.960 --> 02:01.080
 that you're the same person and yet you're aging?

02:01.080 --> 02:04.720
 Yeah, I have this tension that I'm still a kid,

02:04.720 --> 02:05.960
 but that helps in my career.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.000
 Scientists need to have a wonder about the world

02:08.000 --> 02:10.560
 and you don't wanna grow up at 12 year olds

02:10.560 --> 02:13.440
 and even younger, I would say six, seven year olds.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.600
 I've still got that boy in me and I can look at things.

02:16.600 --> 02:17.520
 It's a gift, I think,

02:17.520 --> 02:20.040
 that I can see things for the first time if I choose to

02:20.040 --> 02:23.200
 and then explain them as I would to a six year old

02:23.200 --> 02:25.000
 because I am that mentally.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.760
 But on the other hand, I'm getting older, right?

02:26.760 --> 02:29.280
 I run a lab of 20 people at Harvard.

02:29.280 --> 02:33.560
 I've got a book, I've got science to do, companies to run.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.720
 And so I have to, on most days,

02:35.720 --> 02:38.200
 just pretend to be a grown up and be mature,

02:38.200 --> 02:40.720
 but I definitely don't feel that way.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.440
 There's something I really appreciated

02:43.440 --> 02:44.960
 in the opening of your book.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.960
 You talked about your grandma there.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.400
 And on this kind of theme, on this kind of topic,

02:50.400 --> 02:53.720
 she first of all had a big influence on you.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.540
 My grandmother had a big influence on me.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.840
 And you also mentioned this poem by the author

03:00.840 --> 03:03.760
 of Winnie the Pooh, Alan Alexander Milne.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.120
 Maybe I can read it real quick

03:06.120 --> 03:10.280
 because I love, on the topic of being children.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.560
 When I was one, I had just begun.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.800
 When I was two, I was nearly new.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.280
 When I was three, I was hardly me.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.840
 When I was four, I was not much more.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.160
 When I was five, I was just alive.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.320
 But now I am six.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.480
 I am as clever, as clever, so I think I'll be six,

03:27.480 --> 03:29.600
 now, forever and ever.

03:31.440 --> 03:36.440
 So this idea of being six and staying six forever,

03:37.720 --> 03:40.560
 being youthful, being curious, being childlike,

03:41.360 --> 03:43.400
 this and other things,

03:43.400 --> 03:46.800
 what influence has your grandmother had

03:46.800 --> 03:51.600
 when you're thinking about life, about death, about love?

03:53.280 --> 03:55.000
 Yeah, I was getting misty eyed as you read that

03:55.000 --> 03:58.120
 because that poem was read to me very often,

03:58.120 --> 04:01.480
 if not every day by my grandmother who partially raised me.

04:02.360 --> 04:06.480
 And she was as much a Bohemian as an artist, philosopher.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.200
 And she's one of those people

04:08.200 --> 04:09.840
 that wouldn't talk about the little things.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.640
 She said, I hate small talk.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.000
 Don't talk to me about politics or the weather.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
 Yeah, talk to me about human beings and culture.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.120
 So I was raised on that.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.680
 And this poem was one that she read to me often

04:20.680 --> 04:25.680
 because she knew that the mind of a child is precious,

04:26.120 --> 04:28.600
 it's honest, it's pure.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.560
 And she grew up during the Second World War

04:31.560 --> 04:35.760
 and in Hungary and Budapest witnessed the worst of humanity.

04:35.760 --> 04:40.120
 She was trying to save a whole group of Jewish friends

04:40.120 --> 04:41.440
 in her apartment,

04:41.440 --> 04:46.160
 saw what happened after the World War, which was there was,

04:46.160 --> 04:47.840
 the Russians were in control

04:47.840 --> 04:50.400
 and locals weren't necessarily treated well

04:50.400 --> 04:52.600
 if they were rebellious, which she was.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.520
 And then there was the revolution in 56,

04:54.520 --> 04:57.320
 which she was part of and had to escape the country.

04:57.320 --> 05:01.320
 So she saw what can happen when humans do their worst.

05:01.320 --> 05:05.320
 And her words to me expressed in part through that poem

05:05.320 --> 05:09.640
 was David, always stay young and innocent

05:09.640 --> 05:11.640
 and have wonder about the world

05:11.640 --> 05:15.480
 and then do your best to make humanity the best it can be.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.040
 And that's who I am.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.360
 That's what I live for.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.840
 That's what I get up in the morning to do

05:19.840 --> 05:21.680
 is to leave the world a better place

05:21.680 --> 05:23.200
 and show to whoever's watching us,

05:23.200 --> 05:26.800
 whether it's aliens or some future human historian,

05:26.800 --> 05:29.600
 that we can do better than we did in the 20th century.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.240
 You know, we mentioned offline this idea

05:33.240 --> 05:34.960
 of bringing people back to life

05:34.960 --> 05:38.280
 through artificial intelligence.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.880
 Sort of, I don't know if you've seen videos

05:40.880 --> 05:45.240
 of basically animating people back to life,

05:45.240 --> 05:47.680
 meaning whether it's, for me,

05:47.680 --> 05:49.840
 a person I've been working on specifically

05:49.840 --> 05:53.240
 about Albert Einstein, but also Alan Turing,

05:53.240 --> 05:55.800
 Isaac Newton, and Richard Feynman.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.560
 And it's an opportunity to bring people

05:59.560 --> 06:02.400
 that meant a lot to others in the world

06:02.400 --> 06:06.840
 and animate them and be able to have a conversation with them.

06:06.840 --> 06:11.840
 At first, to try to visually explore

06:14.840 --> 06:18.000
 the full richness of character that they had

06:18.000 --> 06:20.880
 as they struggle with the ideas of the modern age.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.120
 Sort of, it's less about bringing back their mind

06:24.120 --> 06:27.440
 and more bringing back the visual quirks

06:27.440 --> 06:29.000
 that made them who they are.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.920
 And then maybe in the future,

06:30.920 --> 06:33.200
 it's using the textual, the visual,

06:33.200 --> 06:38.200
 the video, the audio data to actually compress

06:38.600 --> 06:41.080
 down the person for who they are

06:41.080 --> 06:42.480
 and be able to generate text.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.720
 There's a few companies.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.200
 There's Replica, which is a chat engine

06:46.200 --> 06:48.240
 that was born out of the idea of bringing,

06:48.240 --> 06:53.240
 the founder lost her friend to,

06:53.480 --> 06:55.880
 he got ran over by a car.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.720
 And the initial reason she founded the company

06:59.720 --> 07:02.840
 was trying to just have a conversation with her friend.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.360
 She trained machine learning, natural language system

07:07.360 --> 07:09.480
 on the text that they exchanged with each other

07:09.480 --> 07:11.880
 and she had a conversation with him

07:11.880 --> 07:13.880
 sort of after he was gone.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.880
 And the conversation was very trivial.

07:16.880 --> 07:21.200
 It was obvious that it's AI agent,

07:21.200 --> 07:23.240
 but it gave her solace.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.920
 It made her actually feel really good.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.920
 And that's the way I wonder if it's possible

07:27.920 --> 07:32.520
 to bring back people that mean something to us personally,

07:32.520 --> 07:36.600
 not just Einstein, but people that we've lost.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.480
 And in that way achieve a kind of small,

07:40.480 --> 07:42.680
 artificial immortality.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.720
 I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.600
 Well, I definitely think about a lot of things.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.640
 That one's a really good one.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.160
 There's a great Black Mirror episode

07:49.160 --> 07:52.840
 about the wife who brings back the boyfriend or husband.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.280
 I think one of the challenges

07:54.280 --> 07:55.520
 with bringing back Richard Feynman

07:55.520 --> 07:58.080
 would be to capture his sense of humor.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.320
 But that would be awesome.

07:59.320 --> 08:00.920
 But yeah, bringing back loved ones would be great,

08:00.920 --> 08:05.920
 especially if they're young and they die early.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.160
 Though it may hold you back from moving on,

08:09.160 --> 08:11.840
 that's another thing that could happen as a negative.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.680
 But I think that's great.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.680
 And I also think that it's gonna be possible,

08:14.680 --> 08:17.280
 especially when we're recording some of us,

08:17.280 --> 08:18.440
 every aspect of our lives,

08:18.440 --> 08:22.600
 whether it's our face or things we see, right?

08:22.600 --> 08:26.040
 Eventually one day, everything we see can be recorded.

08:26.040 --> 08:30.600
 And then you can build somebody's experience and thoughts,

08:30.600 --> 08:35.000
 speech and you will have replicas of everybody,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
 at least digitally and physically,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.720
 you could do that too one day.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.360
 But that's a good idea,

08:40.360 --> 08:42.640
 especially because there are people that I'd like to meet

08:42.640 --> 08:44.960
 and I think it's easier than building a time machine.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.320
 One person I'd love to meet is Benjamin Franklin.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.160
 Really?

08:48.160 --> 08:51.120
 Well, I wouldn't go back in time, I would,

08:51.120 --> 08:54.080
 but I'd prefer to bring him into the future and say,

08:54.080 --> 08:57.040
 can you believe we have this thinking machine

08:57.040 --> 08:58.440
 in our pockets now?

08:58.440 --> 09:00.240
 And he just see the look on his face

09:00.240 --> 09:01.320
 as to where humanity has come.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.480
 Cause I think of him as a modern guy

09:03.480 --> 09:05.480
 that just was before his time.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.320
 Yeah.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.520
 So you're thinking Benjamin Franklin, a scientist,

09:08.520 --> 09:10.400
 not Benjamin Franklin, the political thing.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.000
 Cause he'd be very upset with Congress right now.

09:13.000 --> 09:13.840
 Right.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.160
 So maybe you talk to him about science and technology,

09:16.160 --> 09:19.560
 not politics, or maybe you just don't get him on Twitter

09:19.560 --> 09:22.400
 because he'll be very upset with human civilization.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.360
 You know, I wonder what their personalities are like.

09:25.360 --> 09:29.080
 Isaac Newton, it does seem complicated to figure out

09:29.080 --> 09:30.520
 what their personality is like.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.320
 Even Friedrich Nietzsche, who I also thought about.

09:33.320 --> 09:36.840
 Feynman is, we just have enough video

09:36.840 --> 09:39.400
 where we get the full kind of,

09:39.400 --> 09:42.480
 I mean, it shows you how important it is

09:42.480 --> 09:47.480
 to get not the official kind of book level presentation

09:47.600 --> 09:49.600
 of a human, but the authentic,

09:49.600 --> 09:52.000
 the full spectrum of humanity.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.280
 You mentioned collecting data about a person,

09:54.280 --> 09:57.320
 collecting the whole thing, the whole of life,

09:57.320 --> 09:59.520
 the ups and downs, the embarrassing stuff,

09:59.520 --> 10:01.640
 the beautiful stuff, not just the things

10:01.640 --> 10:03.200
 that's condensed into a book.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.920
 And then with Feynman, you start to see that a little bit.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.960
 Through conversations, you start to see peaks

10:07.960 --> 10:09.360
 of like that genius.

10:09.360 --> 10:12.960
 And then through stories about him from others.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.520
 And then certainly you, the sad thing about Alan Turing,

10:16.520 --> 10:21.160
 for example, is there's very little, if any,

10:21.160 --> 10:22.280
 recording of him.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.200
 In fact, I haven't been able to find recording.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.200
 Allegedly, there's supposed to be a recording of him.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.680
 Doing some kind of radio broadcast,

10:29.680 --> 10:32.120
 but I haven't been able to find anything.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.720
 And so that's truly sad.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.840
 That it feels like it makes you realize

10:38.480 --> 10:42.320
 how the upside, how nice it is to collect data

10:42.320 --> 10:45.920
 about a person, to capture that person.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.720
 That's the upside of the modern internet age,

10:48.720 --> 10:51.320
 the digital age, that that information,

10:52.440 --> 10:54.240
 yeah, creates a kind of immortality.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.080
 And then you can choose to highlight

10:57.080 --> 10:58.160
 the best parts of the person,

10:58.160 --> 11:00.560
 maybe throw away the ugly parts

11:00.560 --> 11:03.440
 and celebrate them even after they're gone.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.040
 So that's a really interesting opportunity.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.880
 You've also mentioned to me offline

11:07.880 --> 11:10.320
 that you're really excited about all the different

11:10.320 --> 11:11.960
 wearables and all the different ways

11:11.960 --> 11:15.640
 we can collect information about our bodies,

11:15.640 --> 11:20.240
 about the whole thing, what's most exciting to you

11:20.240 --> 11:25.240
 in terms of collecting the biological data

11:25.640 --> 11:27.800
 about our human being?

11:27.800 --> 11:29.240
 Well, so I'm a biologist.

11:29.240 --> 11:33.080
 I find animals and humans as machines very interesting.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.440
 It's one of the reasons I didn't become an engineer

11:36.440 --> 11:38.080
 or a surgeon, I wanted to understand

11:38.080 --> 11:39.120
 how we actually built.

11:40.560 --> 11:45.560
 And so I think a lot about machines merging with humans.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.960
 And the first of that are the bio wearables.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.240
 And so I talked a lot about this,

11:50.240 --> 11:52.400
 I wrote about it in Lifespan, the book,

11:52.400 --> 11:56.800
 and pictured a future where you would be monitored constantly

11:56.800 --> 11:59.240
 so that you wouldn't suddenly have a heart attack,

11:59.240 --> 12:02.600
 you'd know that was coming or you wouldn't go to the doctor

12:02.600 --> 12:05.640
 and they don't know if you need an antibiotic or not.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.160
 Long term, how old are you?

12:09.160 --> 12:10.680
 How to fix things, what should you eat?

12:10.680 --> 12:11.520
 What should you take?

12:11.520 --> 12:12.920
 What should your doctor do?

12:12.920 --> 12:16.040
 These devices, I predicted, would be smarter,

12:16.040 --> 12:18.040
 better educated than your physician

12:18.040 --> 12:19.680
 and would augment them.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.440
 And then there'd be a human that would just tick off

12:21.440 --> 12:24.280
 to see if that it's correct and they approve.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.800
 I also was predicting in the book

12:26.800 --> 12:30.160
 that we would have video conferences with our doctors

12:30.160 --> 12:32.880
 and that medicines would be delivered initially by courier

12:32.880 --> 12:34.520
 but eventually by drones and get it to you,

12:34.520 --> 12:36.200
 sometimes in an emergency.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.960
 And that we could even have pills

12:37.960 --> 12:41.800
 that were synthesized or delivered in your kitchen

12:41.800 --> 12:43.920
 and combined certainly.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.960
 What's amazing about that is that,

12:45.960 --> 12:49.160
 what are we now, two years since the book came out,

12:49.160 --> 12:52.360
 even less, and that future is basically here already.

12:52.360 --> 12:56.840
 COVID 19 accelerated that incredibly.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.720
 So where we're at now in society is if you want to pay for it,

12:59.720 --> 13:01.680
 you can have a blood test that will detect cancer

13:01.680 --> 13:03.560
 10, 20 years earlier than it would

13:03.560 --> 13:05.320
 before it forms a tumor.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.880
 You can, of course, do your genome very cheaply

13:07.880 --> 13:09.360
 for less than $100 now.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.320
 There are biowarables already.

13:12.320 --> 13:17.160
 I wear this ring from Aura that I have a number of years of data.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.200
 I've been doing blood tests for the last 12 years

13:19.200 --> 13:22.560
 with a company called Inside Tracker, which I consult for.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.160
 And so I have all of that data as well

13:24.160 --> 13:27.680
 and there's 34 different parameters on my testosterone,

13:27.680 --> 13:30.000
 my blood glucose, my inflammation.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.680
 And I use all that data to, of course,

13:32.680 --> 13:34.680
 I wear a watch that measures things as well.

13:34.680 --> 13:39.240
 I use that data to keep my body in optimal shape.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.120
 So I'm now 51 and according to those parameters,

13:42.120 --> 13:45.720
 I'm at least as good as someone in their early 40s.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.160
 And if I really work at it,

13:47.160 --> 13:52.000
 I can get my biochemistry down to early to mid 30s.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.200
 Though I like to now eat a little dessert once in a while.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.680
 So that's the future we're in right now.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.880
 Anyone can do what I just said.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.200
 But in the very near future, just in the next few years,

14:04.200 --> 14:06.360
 you can be wearing wearables.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.520
 So I'm currently wearing a little,

14:08.520 --> 14:10.920
 what's called a bio sticker.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.040
 This one I just put on last night.

14:14.040 --> 14:18.760
 It's about an inch long, a few millimeters.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.640
 For people just listening, it's on David's chest.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.120
 It's just the, how does it attach?

14:23.120 --> 14:24.240
 It's just kind of.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.080
 It sticks on.

14:25.080 --> 14:25.920
 Sticks on.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.680
 Yeah, so on one side you have an on button that you press.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.240
 The lights come on, flashes four times.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.440
 It's good to go.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.920
 It immediately syncs to your phone.

14:32.920 --> 14:37.200
 And this one, it's called a bio button, nice name.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.440
 And there's another one that I have

14:38.440 --> 14:41.440
 that I haven't tried yet that does EKG on your heart.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.320
 This is mainly for doctors to monitor patients

14:43.320 --> 14:45.560
 that go home after a heart attack or surgery.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.920
 But that's medical grade FDA approved device.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.200
 So there will be a day, in fact, it's already here

14:51.200 --> 14:55.200
 that doctors are using these to get patients to go home

14:55.200 --> 14:59.400
 and save a week in hospital, $2,000 at least

14:59.400 --> 15:00.880
 for each patient.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.400
 That's massive savings for the hospital.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.520
 But ultimately what I'm excited about is a future

15:06.520 --> 15:10.720
 that isn't that far off where everybody,

15:10.720 --> 15:11.720
 certainly in developed countries,

15:11.720 --> 15:14.320
 eventually these will cost a few cents and rechargeable.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.600
 The only cost will be the software subscription

15:16.600 --> 15:19.200
 that can be monitored constantly.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.000
 And to give you an idea what this is measuring me

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
 at 1,000 times a second is my vibrations as I speak,

15:26.200 --> 15:29.560
 my orientation, it already has told me this morning

15:29.560 --> 15:33.200
 how I slept, where I slept, what side I slept on.

15:33.200 --> 15:37.040
 We've got sneezing, coughing, body temperature,

15:37.040 --> 15:40.880
 heart rate, heart of other parameters of the heart

15:40.880 --> 15:42.440
 that would indicate heart health.

15:44.040 --> 15:49.040
 These data are being used to now to predict sickness.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.680
 So eventually we'll have just in the next year or so

15:53.680 --> 15:56.360
 the ability to predict whether something or diagnose

15:56.360 --> 16:00.920
 whether something is pneumonia or just a rhinovirus

16:00.920 --> 16:03.120
 that can be treated or not, right?

16:03.120 --> 16:06.400
 This is really going to not just revolutionize medicine

16:06.400 --> 16:08.560
 but I think extend lives dramatically.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.560
 Because if I'm gonna have a heart attack next week

16:11.560 --> 16:14.480
 and that's possible, this device should know that

16:14.480 --> 16:17.000
 and I'll be in hospital before I even have it.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.280
 Maybe you can talk a little bit about Inside Tracker

16:19.280 --> 16:22.040
 because I saw that there's some really cool things in there.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.000
 Like it actually, so maybe you can talk about,

16:26.000 --> 16:27.760
 I guess that you're collecting blood

16:27.760 --> 16:29.280
 and to give it the data.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.520
 So, and it has like basic recommendations

16:32.520 --> 16:34.240
 on how to improve your life.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.600
 So we're not just talking about diseases, right?

16:36.600 --> 16:39.120
 Like anticipating having a particular disease

16:39.120 --> 16:41.920
 but it's almost like guiding your trajectory to life,

16:41.920 --> 16:44.640
 how to, whether it's extend your life

16:44.640 --> 16:46.760
 or just live a more fulfilling,

16:46.760 --> 16:48.240
 like improve the quality of life,

16:48.240 --> 16:50.320
 I suppose this is the right way to say it.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.560
 What, how does Inside Tracker work?

16:52.560 --> 16:53.400
 What the heck is it?

16:53.400 --> 16:55.160
 Because I thought there was also pretty cool.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.000
 Yeah.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.840
 What is it?

16:56.840 --> 16:58.280
 Is it something other people can use?

16:58.280 --> 16:59.760
 You can definitely use it.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.120
 You can sign up, it's consumer.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.480
 It's like a company, consumer facing company.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.080
 It is, yeah.

17:06.080 --> 17:09.040
 And I also want to democratize the ability

17:09.040 --> 17:11.040
 to just take a mouth swab eventually.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.600
 We don't need to have a blood test necessarily.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.680
 But for now it's a blood test

17:14.680 --> 17:18.440
 and you'd go to a lab core request in the US.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.880
 It's also available overseas.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.600
 You can upload your own data for a minimal cost

17:22.600 --> 17:26.600
 and get the algorithms, the AI in the background

17:26.600 --> 17:30.160
 to take that data, plot where you are against others

17:30.160 --> 17:33.480
 in your age group in terms of health and longevity

17:33.480 --> 17:36.040
 at bio age, they call it inner age.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.160
 But also it provides recommendations.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.680
 And this isn't just a bunch of BS.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.680
 It sounds like it might be to say,

17:41.680 --> 17:44.400
 I'll go eat this or go to that restaurant and order that.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.440
 But it's actually based on,

17:46.440 --> 17:49.840
 they basic this company has entered hundreds,

17:49.840 --> 17:51.800
 now it would be thousands of scientific papers

17:51.800 --> 17:54.240
 into their database and hundreds of thousands

17:54.240 --> 17:55.760
 of human data points.

17:55.760 --> 17:59.080
 And they have tens of thousands of individuals

17:59.080 --> 18:01.680
 that have been tracked over time and anonymously

18:01.680 --> 18:04.320
 that data is used to say what works and what doesn't.

18:04.320 --> 18:05.800
 If you eat that, what works?

18:05.800 --> 18:07.680
 If you take that supplement, what works?

18:07.680 --> 18:09.680
 And I was a coauthor on a paper that showed

18:09.680 --> 18:13.520
 that the recommendations for food and supplements

18:15.120 --> 18:18.120
 was better than the leading drug for type two diabetes.

18:19.000 --> 18:19.840
 That's so cool.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.720
 The idea that you can connect,

18:21.720 --> 18:24.960
 like skipping the human having to do this work,

18:24.960 --> 18:27.440
 you can connect the scientific papers,

18:27.440 --> 18:30.160
 almost like meta analysis of the science

18:30.160 --> 18:32.560
 connected to the individual data.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.480
 And then based on that sort of connect your data

18:35.480 --> 18:38.440
 to whatever the proper group is within the,

18:38.440 --> 18:40.520
 whatever the scientific paper is

18:40.520 --> 18:43.120
 to make the suggestion of how,

18:43.120 --> 18:47.200
 like how that work applies to your life.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.720
 And then that ultimately maps to like a recommendation

18:49.720 --> 18:51.720
 what you should do with your life.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.600
 It all, like this giant system

18:54.600 --> 18:57.040
 that ultimately recommends you should drink more coffee

18:57.040 --> 18:58.520
 or less.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.360
 Right, and we'll have the genome in there as well.

19:00.360 --> 19:01.960
 You can upload that.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.720
 And so these programs will know us way better

19:04.720 --> 19:07.560
 than we do and our doctors as well.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.840
 The idea of going to a doctor once a year for an annual

19:09.840 --> 19:11.280
 checkup and having, you know,

19:11.280 --> 19:14.720
 males get a finger up their butt and, you know, you cough.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.080
 That to me is a joke.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.200
 That's medieval medicine.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.520
 And that's very soon going to be seen as medieval.

19:21.520 --> 19:26.000
 Yeah, it's a, to me as a computer science person,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.680
 it's always upsetting to go to the doctor

19:28.680 --> 19:31.160
 and just look at him and like realize,

19:31.160 --> 19:33.200
 you know nothing about me.

19:33.200 --> 19:38.200
 Like you're making your like opinions based on like,

19:38.640 --> 19:42.560
 it is very valuable years of intuition building

19:42.560 --> 19:45.920
 about basic symptoms, but you're just like, it is medieval.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.240
 They're very good at it.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.600
 In fact, doctors in medieval times

19:49.600 --> 19:53.640
 will probably damn good at working with very little.

19:53.640 --> 19:58.520
 But the thing is I'd rather prefer a doctor

19:58.520 --> 20:00.080
 that doesn't really know what they're doing,

20:00.080 --> 20:03.080
 but has a huge amount of data to work with.

20:03.080 --> 20:03.920
 Well, you're right.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.600
 And many of my good friends are doctors.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.520
 I work at Harvard.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.640
 So I'm not against the profession at all.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.680
 But I think that they need just as much help

20:11.680 --> 20:13.480
 as anyone else does.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.320
 We wouldn't drive a car without a dashboard.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.160
 We wouldn't think of it.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.880
 So why would doctors do the same?

20:18.720 --> 20:21.400
 If we could, could we step back to the big,

20:21.400 --> 20:24.520
 profound philosophical, both tragic and beautiful question

20:24.520 --> 20:28.720
 about age, how and why do we age?

20:28.720 --> 20:31.520
 Is it from an engineering perspective?

20:31.520 --> 20:33.680
 You said you like the biological machine.

20:33.680 --> 20:37.760
 Is that a feature or a bug of the biological machine?

20:37.760 --> 20:40.720
 It is both a bug and a feature.

20:40.720 --> 20:44.640
 Evolutionary speaking, we only live as long as we need to

20:44.640 --> 20:46.240
 to replace ourselves efficiently.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.120
 If you're a mouse, you're only gonna live

20:49.120 --> 20:50.600
 two and a half years, three years.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.480
 You're probably gonna die of starvation, predation,

20:52.480 --> 20:54.480
 freezing in the winter.

20:54.480 --> 20:57.160
 So they divert most of their resources

20:57.160 --> 21:00.080
 to reproducing rapidly, but they don't put a lot

21:00.080 --> 21:04.360
 of energy into preserving their soma, which is their body.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.480
 Conversely, a baleen type of whale, a bowhead whale

21:07.480 --> 21:09.360
 in particular will live hundreds of years

21:09.360 --> 21:11.120
 because they're at the top of the food chain

21:11.120 --> 21:12.680
 and they can live as long as they want.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.160
 So they breed slowly and build a body at last.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.440
 We're somewhere in between because we've, you know,

21:17.440 --> 21:19.720
 we've really only just come out of the savannas

21:19.720 --> 21:22.120
 where we could be picked off by a cat.

21:22.120 --> 21:25.440
 We were pretty wimpy going back six million years ago.

21:25.440 --> 21:30.120
 So we actually need to evolve quicker than evolution will.

21:30.120 --> 21:33.600
 And that's why we can use our oversized brains

21:33.600 --> 21:36.200
 and intuition to give us what evolution

21:36.200 --> 21:38.320
 not only didn't give us, but took away from us.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.720
 Now we're pathetic, look at our bodies.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.960
 These arms, if any of us, even the strongest person

21:42.960 --> 21:45.040
 in the world went in a cage with a chimpanzee,

21:45.040 --> 21:47.440
 the chimp could knock that person's head off, no question.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.280
 So we're pathetic.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.320
 We need to engineer ourselves to be healthier

21:50.320 --> 21:51.600
 and longer lived.

21:51.600 --> 21:55.680
 So getting to aging, we can do better, right?

21:55.680 --> 21:57.280
 Whales do way better.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.520
 We're trying to learn how whales do that.

21:59.520 --> 22:03.320
 And if you ask really anybody in the field now, professor,

22:03.320 --> 22:07.400
 they'll say there are eight or nine hallmarks of aging,

22:07.400 --> 22:11.560
 which are really, it's a word for causes of aging.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.560
 So that you probably have heard of some of these.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.640
 Your listeners will have lots of telomeres,

22:16.640 --> 22:19.640
 the ends of the chromosomes, like the little ends

22:19.640 --> 22:21.920
 of shoelaces, that kind of thing.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.600
 They get too short, cells stop dividing,

22:23.600 --> 22:28.600
 becomes senescent, they put out what are called mitogens

22:28.640 --> 22:31.120
 that cause cancer and inflammatory molecules.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.320
 So that's another aspect of aging, cellulose senescence.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.000
 Another one is loss of the energetics.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.760
 So mitochondria, the battery packs wind down.

22:39.760 --> 22:43.120
 There's a whole bunch, stem cells, proteostasis.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.520
 Well, these are our Achilles heels that I'm talking about.

22:45.520 --> 22:48.440
 They're a common amongst old life forms, really.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.680
 But if you want me to jump to the chase as to where,

22:51.680 --> 22:54.440
 what is the upstream defining factor?

22:54.440 --> 22:57.320
 If we boil it down, what do we get?

22:57.320 --> 22:59.760
 So most biologists would say you can't boil it down.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.240
 It's too complex.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.680
 I would say you can boil it down to an equation,

23:03.680 --> 23:05.880
 which is the preservation of information

23:05.880 --> 23:08.960
 and lost due to entropy, i.e. noise.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.120
 And that is the basis of my research.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.880
 It originally came out of discoveries in yeast cells,

23:14.880 --> 23:17.280
 where I went to MIT in the 1990s.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.800
 You studied bread?

23:18.800 --> 23:20.240
 I kind of did.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.160
 I studied the makers of bread,

23:23.160 --> 23:25.520
 a little yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae,

23:25.520 --> 23:29.240
 which at the time was one of the hottest, excuse the pun,

23:29.240 --> 23:30.960
 organisms to work on.

23:30.960 --> 23:35.360
 But we figured out in the lab why yeast cells get old

23:35.360 --> 23:37.480
 and found genes that control that process

23:37.480 --> 23:39.040
 and made them live longer,

23:39.040 --> 23:41.440
 which was an amazing four years of my life.

23:41.440 --> 23:46.440
 One of those genes had a name with an acronym SIR2.

23:48.240 --> 23:49.720
 Now the two is irrelevant.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.840
 The SIR is important,

23:51.840 --> 23:53.960
 and the most important letter out of all of those three

23:53.960 --> 23:57.000
 is i, which stands for information.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.640
 Silent information regulator number two.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.120
 When you put more copies of that gene in,

24:01.120 --> 24:02.800
 just put in one more copy,

24:02.800 --> 24:04.760
 the yeast cells lived 30% longer

24:04.760 --> 24:06.120
 and suppressed the cause of aging,

24:06.120 --> 24:09.040
 which was the dysregulation of information in the cell.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.640
 And then, so fast forward to now,

24:11.640 --> 24:14.600
 I've been looking in humans and mice

24:14.600 --> 24:17.760
 because they live shorter and cheaper to study,

24:17.760 --> 24:20.800
 where the loss of information in our bodies

24:20.800 --> 24:22.600
 is a root cause of aging.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.040
 And I think it is.

24:24.040 --> 24:29.040
 Your boldness in viewing biology in this way is fascinating

24:29.520 --> 24:31.800
 because that also leads to a kind of,

24:31.800 --> 24:36.800
 it's almost like allows for a theory of aging

24:40.280 --> 24:43.120
 like you could boil it down to a single equation

24:43.120 --> 24:45.960
 and it leads to a perhaps a metric

24:45.960 --> 24:48.640
 that allows you to optimize aging,

24:48.640 --> 24:51.320
 sort of in the fight against entropy.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.360
 It's to figure out which mechanisms,

24:53.360 --> 24:55.720
 like you said, the silent information regulator,

24:55.720 --> 24:58.560
 which mechanisms allow you to preserve information

24:58.560 --> 25:01.640
 like without injecting noise,

25:01.640 --> 25:03.720
 without creating entropy,

25:03.720 --> 25:06.960
 without creating degradation of that information.

25:06.960 --> 25:11.120
 For some reason, converting biology,

25:11.120 --> 25:13.480
 which I thought was mostly impossible

25:13.480 --> 25:15.640
 into an engineering problem,

25:15.640 --> 25:19.360
 feels like it makes it amenable to optimization,

25:19.360 --> 25:22.520
 to solving problems, to creating technology

25:22.520 --> 25:26.640
 that can, whether that's genetic engineering or AI,

25:26.640 --> 25:30.920
 it makes it possible to create the technology

25:30.920 --> 25:34.880
 that would improve the degradation of information

25:34.880 --> 25:36.240
 and aging.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.480
 Is there more concrete ways you think about

25:38.480 --> 25:41.440
 the kind of information we want to preserve?

25:41.440 --> 25:46.120
 And also, is there good ideas about regulators

25:46.120 --> 25:51.120
 of that information, about ways to prevent the distortion

25:52.400 --> 25:54.000
 of the degradation of that information?

25:54.000 --> 25:54.840
 Right.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.080
 We have silent information regulator genes in our bodies.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.840
 We have seven of them,

25:58.840 --> 26:00.360
 SurT1 through SurT7, they're called.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.200
 And we found in mice, one way to slow down

26:03.200 --> 26:05.840
 the loss of information is to just give more of these,

26:06.880 --> 26:08.440
 to upregulate these genes.

26:08.440 --> 26:12.000
 So we made a mouse that has more of this SurT1 gene,

26:12.000 --> 26:15.160
 turned it on, and that slowed down the aging of the brain

26:15.160 --> 26:16.520
 and preserved their information.

26:16.520 --> 26:19.440
 Now, what information am I talking about, you might ask.

26:19.440 --> 26:22.000
 Well, again, you can simplify biology.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.120
 There are two types of information in the cell primarily.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.200
 The one we all read about and know about

26:27.200 --> 26:29.040
 is the DNA, the genome.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.480
 And that's base four information, ATCG,

26:32.480 --> 26:35.280
 the four chemicals that make up the various sequences

26:35.280 --> 26:37.920
 of the genome, billions of letters.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.000
 And that also degrades over time.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.640
 But what's been fascinating is that we find

26:42.640 --> 26:45.160
 that that information is pretty much intact

26:45.160 --> 26:47.320
 in old animals and people.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.160
 You can clone a dog, one of my friends in LA

26:49.160 --> 26:51.000
 just cloned his dog three times.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.120
 So this is dual, right?

26:52.120 --> 26:53.840
 It means that the genome can be intact.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.240
 But what's the other type of information?

26:56.240 --> 26:59.960
 It's the epigenome, the regulators of the genetic

26:59.960 --> 27:01.280
 information.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.440
 And physically, that's really just how the DNA is wrapped up

27:04.440 --> 27:08.080
 or looped out for the cell to access it and read it.

27:08.080 --> 27:11.240
 So it's similar to, and excuse this analogy,

27:11.240 --> 27:15.240
 but it's a good one, a compact disc or a DVD.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.520
 Those pits in the foil are the digital information.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.600
 That's the genome.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.280
 And the epigenome is the reader of that information.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.320
 And in a different cell, you'd read different music,

27:25.320 --> 27:28.040
 different songs, different symphonies.

27:28.040 --> 27:31.640
 And that's what gets laid down when we're in the womb

27:31.640 --> 27:34.640
 and that makes a skin cell forever a skin cell

27:34.640 --> 27:36.400
 and not a brain cell tomorrow.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.800
 Thank God, otherwise our brains wouldn't work very well.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.240
 But over time, what we see is that the brain cells

27:41.240 --> 27:42.960
 start to look more like skin cells.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.640
 And the kidney cells start to look more like liver cells.

27:45.640 --> 27:48.120
 And what we call X differentiate.

27:48.120 --> 27:51.360
 This is a term that we use in my lab, but isn't yet widely

27:51.360 --> 27:53.440
 used, but we needed a term to explain this.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.840
 And that process of X differentiation,

27:55.840 --> 28:01.160
 the loss of the reader of the CD or the DVD,

28:01.160 --> 28:06.240
 we liken that to scratches on the DVD

28:06.240 --> 28:09.360
 so that the reader cannot fully access the information.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.480
 Now, we can slow down the scratches, as I mentioned.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.160
 We can turn on these genes.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.520
 We can even put in molecules into the cell

28:15.520 --> 28:19.000
 or even eat them and turn on those pathways,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.280
 which my father and I have been trying

28:21.280 --> 28:24.400
 to do for about a decade, to slow things down.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.360
 But the question that I've had is,

28:27.360 --> 28:30.840
 is there a repository of information still in the body?

28:30.840 --> 28:32.240
 Because anyone who knows anything

28:32.240 --> 28:34.000
 about the loss of information or even

28:34.000 --> 28:37.200
 has tried to copy a cassette tape or photocopy or Xerox

28:37.200 --> 28:40.360
 anything knows that over time, you lose that information

28:40.360 --> 28:41.760
 irreparably.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.960
 So I've been looking for a backup copy,

28:43.960 --> 28:47.680
 inspired largely by Claude Shannon's work at MIT as well

28:47.680 --> 28:49.680
 in the 1940s.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.320
 His mathematical theory of communication

28:52.320 --> 28:53.040
 is just brilliant.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.720
 And so I've been looking for what he called the observer, which

28:55.720 --> 28:57.200
 is the backup copy.

28:57.200 --> 29:01.480
 We today might call that the TCPIP protocol of the internet

29:01.480 --> 29:04.000
 that stores information in case it doesn't make it

29:04.000 --> 29:05.040
 to your computer.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.920
 It will fill in the gaps.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.360
 And we've been spending about the last five years

29:09.360 --> 29:12.160
 to try and find if there really is a backup copy in the body

29:12.160 --> 29:16.040
 to reset the epigenome and polish those scratches away.

29:16.040 --> 29:16.960
 That's incredible.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.680
 So finding the backup, so whenever there are too many

29:19.680 --> 29:25.600
 scratches pile up, you can just write a new version.

29:25.600 --> 29:29.400
 Not a new version, but go to the backup and restore it.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.640
 That's really all we're talking about.

29:31.640 --> 29:34.440
 It's not that hard once you know the trick.

29:34.440 --> 29:39.120
 And for people that actually remember DVDs and scratches

29:39.120 --> 29:41.760
 on them, how frustrating it is, that's

29:41.760 --> 29:45.840
 a brilliant metaphor for aging.

29:45.840 --> 29:51.040
 And then the reader is the thing that skips.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.400
 And then it could destroy your experience,

29:53.400 --> 29:54.960
 the richness of the experience that

29:54.960 --> 29:57.160
 is listening to your favorite song.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.960
 Right, but in biology, it's even worse,

29:58.960 --> 30:01.120
 because you'll lose your memory, your kidneys will fail,

30:01.120 --> 30:03.640
 you'll get diabetes, your heart will fail.

30:03.640 --> 30:06.920
 And we call that aging and age related diseases.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.720
 So most people forget that diseases

30:09.720 --> 30:13.880
 that we get when we get old are 80% to 90% caused by aging.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.960
 And we've been trying to fix things with band aids

30:15.960 --> 30:19.040
 after they occur without even generally talking

30:19.040 --> 30:21.400
 about the root cause of the problem.

30:21.400 --> 30:24.560
 Is there the scratches?

30:24.560 --> 30:31.920
 Do those come from, are those programmed or are they failures?

30:31.920 --> 30:36.480
 Meaning is it, so if it's by design,

30:36.480 --> 30:40.960
 then there's like an encoded timeline schedule

30:40.960 --> 30:44.560
 that the body's just on purpose degrading the whole thing.

30:44.560 --> 30:47.080
 And then there's just the wear and tear

30:47.080 --> 30:50.160
 of the scratches and a disc that happen through time.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.480
 Which one is it?

30:51.480 --> 30:54.200
 That's the source of aging.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.440
 It's more akin to wear and tear.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.920
 There isn't a program.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.960
 Getting back to evolution, there's no selection for aging.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.080
 We're not designed to age.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.840
 We just live as long as we need to.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.120
 And then we're at the whim of entropy, basically.

31:06.120 --> 31:09.080
 Second law of thermodynamics stuff falls apart.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.400
 We live a bit longer than age 40 only

31:11.400 --> 31:13.400
 because there are robust, resilient systems.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.280
 But eventually they fail as well.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.920
 Current limit to the human lifespan

31:16.920 --> 31:21.440
 where they completely fail is 122.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.200
 But I don't like to think of it as wear and tear

31:23.200 --> 31:25.880
 because there's two aspects to it.

31:25.880 --> 31:29.320
 There's a system that's built to keep us alive when we're young.

31:29.320 --> 31:33.280
 But actually comes back to bite us as we get older.

31:33.280 --> 31:37.800
 And we call this issue antagonistic pleotropy.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.480
 What's good for you when you're young

31:39.480 --> 31:42.920
 can cause problems when you're older.

31:42.920 --> 31:46.160
 So we've been looking, what is the main causes of the noise?

31:46.160 --> 31:49.320
 And we've found two of them definitively.

31:49.320 --> 31:52.000
 The first one is broken chromosomes.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
 When a chromosome breaks, the cell has to panic

31:55.000 --> 31:58.280
 because that's either gonna cause a cancer or kill the cell.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.320
 There's only two outcomes.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.160
 It's pretty much a problem.

32:01.160 --> 32:05.080
 And so what the cell does is it reorganizes the epigenome

32:05.080 --> 32:06.120
 in a massive way.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.720
 What that leads to is think of it as a tennis match

32:10.720 --> 32:12.600
 or a ping pong game.

32:12.600 --> 32:15.040
 The proteins are the balls and they now leave

32:15.040 --> 32:17.640
 where they should be, which is regulating the genes

32:17.640 --> 32:20.040
 that make the cell type, whatever it is.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.560
 And after they have a dual function,

32:21.560 --> 32:23.080
 they actually go to the break,

32:23.080 --> 32:25.600
 the chromosomal break and fix that.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.800
 And then they come back.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.320
 You might ask, well, why is it set up that way?

32:29.320 --> 32:30.280
 Well, it's a beautiful system.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.840
 It coordinates gene expression,

32:31.840 --> 32:33.760
 the control systems with the repair.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.040
 You want them coordinated.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.360
 Problem is as we get older, this ping pong game,

32:38.360 --> 32:39.480
 some of the balls get lost.

32:39.480 --> 32:42.600
 They don't come back to where they originally started.

32:42.600 --> 32:46.960
 And that's what we think is the main noise for aging.

32:46.960 --> 32:50.440
 And the other cause of aging that we found is cell stress.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.920
 We damage nerves and they age rapidly.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.640
 So that's the other issue.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.240
 There's probably others, smoking, chemicals, for example.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.760
 We know accelerates biological age.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.720
 Pretty dramatically.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.160
 But the question is, can you slow that down

33:04.160 --> 33:06.200
 or can you reset them to get those ping pong balls

33:06.200 --> 33:09.680
 to go back to where they originally started in the game?

33:09.680 --> 33:12.040
 And we think we found a way to do that.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.920
 What, can you give me hints?

33:13.920 --> 33:15.960
 Whose fault is it, and the ball's not coming back,

33:15.960 --> 33:17.720
 is it the proteins themselves?

33:17.720 --> 33:20.120
 Like, are they starting?

33:20.120 --> 33:22.280
 Again, I've been obsessed with the protein folding problem

33:22.280 --> 33:23.240
 from the AI perspective.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.680
 So is it the proteins or is it something else?

33:25.680 --> 33:29.280
 Well, we know who hits the balls and recruits them.

33:29.280 --> 33:33.080
 So that the break is recognized by proteins

33:33.080 --> 33:37.040
 who send out a signal through phosphorylation

33:37.040 --> 33:40.960
 is a typical way cells talk to other proteins.

33:40.960 --> 33:43.560
 And that recruits those repair factors,

33:43.560 --> 33:45.120
 those ping pong balls to the break.

33:45.120 --> 33:49.120
 So the cells actively doing this to try and help itself.

33:49.120 --> 33:53.920
 But we don't know who's to blame for them not coming back.

33:53.920 --> 33:58.480
 That could just be a flaw in the quote unquote design.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.280
 I don't think that there's something saying,

34:00.280 --> 34:04.200
 well, 1% of you balls proteins never go back.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.120
 I just think it's hard to reset a system

34:06.120 --> 34:07.680
 that's constantly changing.

34:07.680 --> 34:12.760
 We have in our bodies close to a trillion DNA breaks every day.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.280
 And imagine that over 80 years,

34:14.280 --> 34:17.520
 what damage that does to our epigenomic information.

34:17.520 --> 34:20.240
 Now, we know that this is, well,

34:20.240 --> 34:21.520
 we never know anything in biology,

34:21.520 --> 34:24.000
 but we have strong evidence that this is true

34:24.000 --> 34:27.600
 because we can mess with animals.

34:27.600 --> 34:31.200
 We can create DNA breaks and tickle them with a few breaks,

34:31.200 --> 34:34.040
 maybe raise it by three fold of background levels

34:34.040 --> 34:35.800
 of normal breakage.

34:35.800 --> 34:40.400
 And if we're right, those mice should get old and they do.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.400
 We can actually, we've created these breaks

34:42.400 --> 34:44.000
 in a way that's titratable.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.280
 We can, it's like a rheostat.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.360
 We can send it to 11.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.800
 And you know, I drove my Tesla here

34:48.800 --> 34:52.400
 and I'm a big fan of Spinal Tap 2, going to 11.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.200
 If we go to 11, we can make a mouse old

34:54.200 --> 34:55.720
 in a matter of months.

34:55.720 --> 34:58.600
 We prefer to go to a level of about four

34:58.600 --> 35:00.200
 and it gets old in 10 months.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.160
 But it's definitely old.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.720
 It's got all of the hallmarks of aging.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.200
 It's got diseases.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.040
 It looks old.

35:06.040 --> 35:06.880
 It's skin is old.

35:06.880 --> 35:08.000
 It's got gray hair.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
 But importantly, we can now measure age

35:10.000 --> 35:11.400
 by looking at the scratches.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.360
 We can look at the epigenome.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.560
 We can measure it and use machine learning

35:14.560 --> 35:15.800
 to give us a number.

35:15.800 --> 35:19.160
 And those mice are 50% older than normal.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.840
 So you can replicate the aging process in a controlled way.

35:21.840 --> 35:26.000
 You can, I mean, in a way that, I mean, you could accelerate it

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
 in a controlled way and measure how much exactly it's aging.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.960
 And that gives you step one of a two step process

35:34.960 --> 35:36.520
 to when you can then figure out, well,

35:36.520 --> 35:37.960
 how can we reverse this?

35:37.960 --> 35:40.160
 And now we're reversing those mice.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.520
 Is there a good, I love what you said.

35:42.520 --> 35:45.200
 I mean, in biology, you really don't know.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.640
 It's such a beautiful mess.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.480
 Is there ideas how to do that?

35:51.480 --> 35:55.040
 Is that on the genetic engineering level?

35:55.040 --> 35:57.640
 Is it like, what can you mess with?

35:57.640 --> 36:02.320
 Is it going to the, trying to discover the backup copies

36:02.320 --> 36:04.200
 and restoring from them?

36:04.200 --> 36:06.280
 Like what's, if it's possible to convert

36:06.280 --> 36:09.520
 into natural language words, what are the ideas here?

36:09.520 --> 36:11.520
 What is the observer and how do we contact it?

36:11.520 --> 36:12.360
 Exactly.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.320
 What's the observer and how do you contact?

36:14.320 --> 36:15.920
 Or if there's other ideas,

36:15.920 --> 36:20.600
 how to reverse the balls getting lost process.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.880
 Yeah. Well, you can slow it down.

36:22.880 --> 36:23.720
 Slow it.

36:23.720 --> 36:26.280
 But we found a reset switch recently.

36:26.280 --> 36:31.280
 We just published this in the December 2020 issue of nature.

36:33.120 --> 36:36.920
 And what we found is that there are three embryonic genes

36:36.920 --> 36:39.840
 that we could put into the adult animal

36:39.840 --> 36:42.080
 to reset the age of the tissues.

36:42.080 --> 36:44.720
 And it only takes four to eight weeks to work well.

36:44.720 --> 36:47.280
 And we can take a blind mouse that's lost its vision

36:47.280 --> 36:48.360
 due to aging.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.520
 Neurons aren't working well towards the brain.

36:50.520 --> 36:52.680
 Reset those neurons back to a younger age.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.240
 And now the mice can see again.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.240
 These three genes are famous actually

36:57.240 --> 36:59.480
 because they're a set of four genes

36:59.480 --> 37:01.680
 discovered by Shinya Yamanaka,

37:01.680 --> 37:04.000
 who won the Nobel Prize in 2016,

37:04.000 --> 37:05.880
 for discovering that those four genes

37:05.880 --> 37:09.600
 when turned on at high levels in adult cells

37:09.600 --> 37:11.880
 can generate stem cells.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.040
 And this is, I think, well known now

37:14.040 --> 37:16.880
 that we can create stem cells from adult tissue.

37:16.880 --> 37:19.440
 But what wasn't known is can you partially take age back

37:19.440 --> 37:21.880
 without becoming a tumor or generating a stem cell

37:21.880 --> 37:24.120
 in the eye, which would be a disaster?

37:24.120 --> 37:24.960
 And the answer is yes.

37:24.960 --> 37:26.640
 There is a system in the body

37:26.640 --> 37:29.040
 that can take the age of a cell back to a certain point,

37:29.040 --> 37:33.080
 but no further, safely, and reset the age.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.560
 And we're now using that to reset the age of the brain

37:36.560 --> 37:39.360
 of those mice that we aged prematurely,

37:39.360 --> 37:41.680
 and they're getting their ability to learn back.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.320
 This is really exciting, right?

37:44.320 --> 37:46.880
 Like, what's the downside of this?

37:46.880 --> 37:49.160
 Well, the downside is if you overdo it,

37:49.160 --> 37:52.160
 and you don't get it right, you might cause tumors.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.880
 But we do it very carefully,

37:54.880 --> 37:57.840
 and we also know that in the eye, it's very safe.

37:57.840 --> 38:01.560
 We also injected these, we deliver them by viruses,

38:01.560 --> 38:05.960
 so we can control where and when they get turned on.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.480
 And in this paper, we've published that

38:08.480 --> 38:10.480
 if we put high levels in the mouse,

38:10.480 --> 38:12.360
 into their veins throughout the body,

38:12.360 --> 38:14.640
 they don't get cancer for over a year.

38:14.640 --> 38:18.560
 So I'm so optimistic that we're going into human studies

38:18.560 --> 38:20.400
 in less than two years from now.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.920
 Is there a place where AI can help?

38:23.920 --> 38:27.640
 Sorry to inject one of the things

38:27.640 --> 38:30.160
 I'm very excited about and passionate about.

38:30.160 --> 38:35.000
 So Google DeepMind recently had a big breakthrough

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
 with Alpha Fold 2, but also Alpha Fold two years ago,

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
 with achieving sort of state of the art performance

38:46.200 --> 38:47.600
 on the protein folding problem,

38:47.600 --> 38:49.200
 single protein folding.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.960
 But it also paints a hopeful picture of what's possible

38:52.960 --> 38:56.040
 to do in terms of simulating the folding of proteins,

38:56.040 --> 39:00.680
 but also simulating biological systems through AI.

39:00.680 --> 39:04.840
 Is there something to you combined with this brilliant work

39:04.840 --> 39:07.840
 on the biology side that you're hopeful about

39:07.840 --> 39:10.240
 where AI can be a tool to help?

39:10.240 --> 39:11.480
 Where isn't it a tool?

39:11.480 --> 39:13.480
 I mean, if you're not using AI right now in biology,

39:13.480 --> 39:14.600
 you're getting left behind.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.480
 We use it all the time.

39:15.480 --> 39:18.560
 We're using it to generate these biological clocks

39:18.560 --> 39:21.160
 to be able to read those scratches.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.920
 We're using it to predict the folding of proteins

39:23.920 --> 39:27.440
 so we can target molecules and modulate their activity.

39:27.440 --> 39:30.560
 We're using it to assemble genomes of different species.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.840
 We use it to predict the longevity of a mouse

39:35.840 --> 39:38.400
 based on how it reacts to certain things,

39:38.400 --> 39:41.080
 hearing eyesight, generally frailty.

39:41.080 --> 39:45.680
 So we just put out a paper last year on that.

39:45.680 --> 39:46.880
 The other thing we can use it for,

39:46.880 --> 39:49.080
 which is a little off the track here,

39:49.080 --> 39:52.480
 but we use it for predicting which microorganisms

39:52.480 --> 39:55.680
 are in your body, actually not predicting, telling you.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.400
 So our daughter, Natalie,

39:58.400 --> 40:00.920
 was infected with Lyme disease a few years ago.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.720
 Almost went blind from it and the test took four days

40:03.720 --> 40:06.880
 and I thought, just give me the DNA from her spinal fluid.

40:06.880 --> 40:07.880
 I'll go tell you what's in it.

40:07.880 --> 40:10.080
 If it's Lyme disease or not, they refused.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.600
 And so at that point I said, this has to be done better.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.760
 So I've started a company that now can take a sample

40:15.760 --> 40:17.320
 of any part of your body.

40:17.320 --> 40:21.640
 It's typically done now with liver transplant patients

40:21.640 --> 40:24.920
 to detect viruses that come out of their organs.

40:24.920 --> 40:28.400
 But that's another area that AI is extremely important for.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.520
 I think if you're not, in five years,

40:31.520 --> 40:35.400
 if you're not using deep learning, you've got a problem

40:35.400 --> 40:36.960
 because the amount of data that we generate now

40:36.960 --> 40:40.480
 as biologists is just terabytes, can be terabytes per week.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.320
 It'll eventually be terabytes per day.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.920
 And then we just go from there.

40:43.920 --> 40:46.320
 And I actually have trouble recruiting enough

40:46.320 --> 40:47.680
 bioinformaticians.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.240
 A lot of our work is now just number crunching.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.160
 A part of that is collecting the data,

40:55.160 --> 40:57.560
 which is kind of something we've talked a little bit about,

40:57.560 --> 41:00.160
 but is there something you can say

41:00.160 --> 41:04.480
 about how we can collect more and more data,

41:04.480 --> 41:07.600
 not just on the one person level,

41:07.600 --> 41:12.600
 like for you to understand your various markers,

41:13.240 --> 41:16.640
 but to create huge data sets,

41:16.640 --> 41:20.440
 to understand how we can detect certain pathogens,

41:20.440 --> 41:22.680
 detect certain property characteristics

41:22.680 --> 41:25.560
 of whether it's aging or all the other ways

41:25.560 --> 41:27.120
 that your human body can fail.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.760
 It seems like with biology,

41:29.760 --> 41:32.160
 there's a kind of privacy concerns

41:32.160 --> 41:34.960
 that, well, actually not privacy concerns,

41:34.960 --> 41:36.760
 it's almost like regulation

41:36.760 --> 41:40.360
 that kind of prevents like hospitals and sharing data.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.520
 You know, I'm not sure exactly how to say it,

41:44.520 --> 41:48.280
 but it seems like when you look at autonomous vehicles,

41:48.280 --> 41:50.200
 people are much more willing to share data.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.560
 When you look at human biology system,

41:52.560 --> 41:54.360
 people are much less willing to share data.

41:54.360 --> 41:56.880
 Is there a hopeful path forward

41:56.880 --> 42:00.240
 where we can share more and more data at a large scale

42:00.240 --> 42:03.760
 that ultimately ends up helping us understand the human body

42:03.760 --> 42:06.800
 and then treat problems with the human body?

42:06.800 --> 42:08.320
 So we are right in the middle.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.120
 We're living through what's gonna be seen

42:10.120 --> 42:12.640
 as one of the biggest revolutions in human health

42:12.640 --> 42:16.400
 through the gathering of data about our bodies.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.520
 And 20 years ago, people didn't wanna go on social media

42:19.520 --> 42:20.360
 that worried about it.

42:20.360 --> 42:23.640
 Now you have to, if you're a kid, that's for sure.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.520
 Same with medical records.

42:25.520 --> 42:29.400
 These are becoming all digitized and expanded.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.320
 Ultimately, we're going to,

42:31.320 --> 42:34.760
 even if we don't want to, have to be monitored.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.680
 There's gonna be a court case that,

42:36.680 --> 42:38.320
 I bet two, three years from now,

42:38.320 --> 42:39.760
 someone's gonna say,

42:39.760 --> 42:42.360
 how come my father died from a heart attack?

42:42.360 --> 42:44.320
 You had these biosensors, 20 bucks,

42:44.320 --> 42:46.560
 and you didn't use it, lawsuit right there.

42:46.560 --> 42:49.560
 And suddenly all hospitals have to give you one of these.

42:49.560 --> 42:50.800
 There'll be a reversal,

42:50.800 --> 42:53.640
 like to where it's your fault

42:53.640 --> 42:54.800
 if you don't collect the data.

42:54.800 --> 42:58.160
 That's brilliant, and that's absolutely right.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.800
 I mean, that's absolutely right.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.880
 That's the frustration I feel when going to the doctor

43:03.880 --> 43:07.800
 is like, it's almost negligent

43:08.760 --> 43:10.600
 to not collect the data

43:10.600 --> 43:11.920
 because you're making,

43:11.920 --> 43:13.920
 if there's something really wrong with me

43:13.920 --> 43:17.920
 and you're making decisions based on very few tests,

43:17.920 --> 43:19.080
 that's almost negligent

43:19.080 --> 43:20.160
 when you have the opportunity

43:20.160 --> 43:22.000
 to collect a huge amount more data.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.240
 Well, let me tell you something.

43:23.240 --> 43:26.840
 Yeah, I've got this inside tracker data

43:26.840 --> 43:29.040
 for myself over a decade.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.800
 And you'd think my doctor would roll his eyes at this,

43:31.800 --> 43:34.760
 oh, he's gone to a consumer company, blah, blah, blah.

43:34.760 --> 43:36.760
 I had my first checkup in a year

43:36.760 --> 43:39.080
 with him through video conference.

43:39.080 --> 43:42.640
 And he was running blind.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.360
 He really didn't know what was going on with me.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.360
 He asked the usual things,

43:46.360 --> 43:47.200
 how am I sleeping?

43:47.200 --> 43:48.560
 How am I eating?

43:48.560 --> 43:50.040
 These kind of usual things.

43:50.040 --> 43:53.160
 And I said, well, I've got new tests back from inside tracker.

43:53.160 --> 43:55.880
 And he said, great, I'd love to see them.

43:55.880 --> 43:58.120
 So I'd share screen and we look at the graphs,

43:58.120 --> 44:00.840
 look at the data, and he's loving it.

44:00.840 --> 44:04.480
 Cause he cannot order these tests willy nilly.

44:04.480 --> 44:08.960
 So I said, well, let's order a HBA1C blood glucose levels

44:08.960 --> 44:10.120
 because I'm very interested in that.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.360
 That tracks with longevity.

44:11.360 --> 44:13.960
 And he said, well, I have no reason to order that.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.520
 Do you have a family history?

44:15.520 --> 44:18.880
 No, do you have any symptoms of diabetes?

44:18.880 --> 44:20.680
 No, well, I can't order the test.

44:20.680 --> 44:22.200
 I almost wanted to reach through the computer

44:22.200 --> 44:23.840
 and strangle him.

44:23.840 --> 44:26.840
 But instead, I pay a little bit to get these tests done

44:26.840 --> 44:28.320
 and then he looks at them.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.600
 So that's now the way consumer health is going

44:30.600 --> 44:32.720
 is that you can get better data than your doctor can,

44:32.720 --> 44:34.520
 but they like you to do that.

44:34.520 --> 44:37.520
 Quick human question, maybe you can educate me.

44:39.160 --> 44:42.440
 I think doctors sometimes have a bit of an ego.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.680
 I understand that the doctor is super experienced

44:44.680 --> 44:45.520
 with a lot of things,

44:45.520 --> 44:49.240
 but this is a fundamental question of human variability.

44:49.240 --> 44:52.800
 Like I know a lot of specific details about like,

44:52.800 --> 44:54.640
 I mean, it depends, of course, what we're talking about,

44:54.640 --> 44:56.720
 but I bring a lot of knowledge.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.440
 And if I have data with me,

44:58.440 --> 45:02.960
 then I have like several orders of magnitude more knowledge.

45:02.960 --> 45:04.760
 And I think there's an aspect to it

45:04.760 --> 45:09.680
 where the doctor has to put their expert hat,

45:09.680 --> 45:13.240
 like take it off and actually be a curious,

45:13.240 --> 45:16.520
 open minded person and study and look at that data.

45:16.520 --> 45:20.000
 Do you think it's possible to sort of change the culture

45:20.000 --> 45:21.840
 of the medical system to where the doctors

45:21.840 --> 45:25.680
 are almost, as you said, are excited to see the data?

45:25.680 --> 45:26.840
 Or is that already happening?

45:26.840 --> 45:27.640
 It's really happening.

45:27.640 --> 45:30.640
 Now, we've probably lost the last generation

45:30.640 --> 45:31.880
 that there are no hopers,

45:31.880 --> 45:34.480
 but so I teach at Harvard Medical School

45:34.480 --> 45:35.960
 and they're excited about this.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.120
 They're excited about aging,

45:37.120 --> 45:39.560
 which is a new aspect to medicine.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.720
 Oh wow, we can do something about that.

45:41.720 --> 45:43.880
 And then yeah, all this data, what do we do with it?

45:43.880 --> 45:45.880
 There's still the traditional pathology and all that stuff

45:45.880 --> 45:47.160
 which they need to know,

45:47.160 --> 45:52.160
 but time will change their mindset.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.320
 I'm not worried about that.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.760
 And like we were discussing,

45:55.760 --> 45:59.000
 this isn't a question of if, it's just a matter of when.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.280
 And I have a front row seat on all of this.

46:02.280 --> 46:07.280
 I had breakfast with a CEO who is making this happen

46:07.360 --> 46:08.280
 just yesterday.

46:09.560 --> 46:12.760
 I can tell you for sure that most people have no idea

46:12.760 --> 46:14.600
 that this revolution is occurring

46:14.600 --> 46:17.280
 and is happening so quickly.

46:17.280 --> 46:18.400
 If you're running a hospital

46:18.400 --> 46:21.400
 and you can save $2,000 per cardiac patient,

46:21.400 --> 46:22.440
 what are you gonna do?

46:22.440 --> 46:23.400
 You have to use it.

46:23.400 --> 46:25.640
 Otherwise, the hospital down the road

46:25.640 --> 46:28.200
 is gonna be beating you.

46:28.200 --> 46:30.880
 And there are large hospital aggregation.

46:30.880 --> 46:32.920
 So there's Ascension and others

46:32.920 --> 46:37.560
 that just have to go this way for budgetary reasons.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.520
 And right now the US spends,

46:39.520 --> 46:42.480
 what is it, 17% of their GDP on healthcare.

46:42.480 --> 46:45.200
 Let's say one of these buttons on my chest

46:45.200 --> 46:47.280
 costs 20 bucks, it's rechargeable.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.640
 And it can predict people's health

46:48.640 --> 46:52.080
 and save on antibiotics to prevent heart attacks.

46:52.080 --> 46:54.960
 How many billions, if not trillions of dollars

46:54.960 --> 46:57.280
 will that save over the next decade?

46:58.400 --> 47:00.280
 Yeah, so when the public wakes up to this,

47:00.280 --> 47:01.520
 they'll almost demand it.

47:01.520 --> 47:04.080
 Like this should be accepted everywhere.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.080
 This is obvious.

47:05.080 --> 47:06.040
 It's gonna save a lot of money.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.680
 It's gonna improve the quality of life.

47:07.680 --> 47:11.520
 Well, and the CFOs of hospital groups will have to.

47:11.520 --> 47:15.760
 And insurance companies are gonna wanna get in on this.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.120
 So now that gets to privacy, right?

47:17.120 --> 47:20.480
 If should an insurance company have access to your data?

47:20.480 --> 47:21.760
 I would say no.

47:21.760 --> 47:24.120
 But you could voluntarily show them some of it

47:24.120 --> 47:25.520
 if they give you a discount.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.680
 And that's also being worked on right now.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.960
 I hope that we do create kind of systems

47:30.960 --> 47:33.200
 where I can volunteer to share my data

47:33.200 --> 47:35.840
 and I can also take the data back,

47:35.840 --> 47:38.960
 meaning like delete the data, request the deletion of data.

47:38.960 --> 47:42.160
 And then maybe policy creates rules to where

47:42.160 --> 47:44.960
 you can share data, you could delete the data.

47:44.960 --> 47:49.960
 And I think if I have the option to delete all my data

47:50.320 --> 47:52.640
 that a particular company has,

47:52.640 --> 47:54.640
 then I'll share my data with everyone.

47:55.840 --> 48:00.840
 I feel like if, because that gives me the tools

48:01.280 --> 48:04.520
 to be a consumer, an intelligent consumer,

48:04.520 --> 48:08.640
 of awarding my data to a company that deserves it

48:08.640 --> 48:11.200
 and taking it back when the company is behaving.

48:11.200 --> 48:14.200
 And in that way, encourage, as a consumer

48:14.200 --> 48:17.240
 in the capitalist system, encourage the companies

48:17.240 --> 48:20.240
 that are doing great work with that data.

48:20.240 --> 48:24.120
 Well, yeah, healthcare data security is number one.

48:24.120 --> 48:27.720
 On my mind, Inside Tracker made sure that that was true,

48:27.720 --> 48:32.160
 but these buttons on your chest, there's very private stuff.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.520
 They can probably tell if you're having sex one night, right?

48:35.520 --> 48:37.800
 So this is not the kind of stuff you want leaked.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.680
 So I don't know whether it's blockchain or something.

48:39.680 --> 48:40.520
 Speak for yourself.

48:40.520 --> 48:41.680
 I don't want this public.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.520
 The live stream.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.640
 Well, I guess it depends on how you go.

48:45.640 --> 48:48.960
 But there's a lot of stuff you don't want out there.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.560
 And this definitely has to be number one,

48:51.560 --> 48:54.480
 because it's one thing to have your credit card

48:54.480 --> 48:55.840
 information stolen, it's another thing

48:55.840 --> 48:57.680
 your health records are permanently out there.

48:57.680 --> 48:58.520
 Yeah.

48:58.520 --> 48:59.840
 So there's on the biology side,

48:59.840 --> 49:03.600
 super exciting ways to slow aging,

49:03.600 --> 49:05.560
 but there's also on the lifestyle side.

49:05.560 --> 49:08.040
 I've recently did a 72 hour fast,

49:08.040 --> 49:09.880
 just an opportunity to take a pause and be,

49:09.880 --> 49:11.640
 you know, I appreciate life.

49:12.480 --> 49:14.360
 Think about like, there's something about fasting

49:14.360 --> 49:19.280
 that encourages you to reflect deeper

49:19.280 --> 49:24.040
 than you otherwise might, the time kind of slows.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.920
 And you also realize that you're human

49:25.920 --> 49:27.320
 because your body needs food.

49:27.320 --> 49:30.480
 And you start to see your body is almost as a machine

49:30.480 --> 49:33.640
 that takes food and produces thoughts.

49:33.640 --> 49:36.880
 And then ends brief.

49:36.880 --> 49:39.800
 I mean, you start to, depending who you are,

49:39.800 --> 49:41.720
 if you're like engineering minded,

49:41.720 --> 49:43.600
 you start to think of this whole thing

49:43.600 --> 49:46.120
 as a kind of, yeah, as a machine.

49:46.120 --> 49:50.880
 And then also feelings fill this machine.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.480
 Feelings of gratitude of love,

49:52.480 --> 49:57.400
 but also the uglier things of jealousy and greed

49:57.400 --> 49:59.280
 and hate and all those kinds of things.

49:59.280 --> 50:04.280
 And you start to think, okay, how do I manage this body

50:04.600 --> 50:06.200
 to create a rich experience?

50:06.200 --> 50:07.840
 All of that comes from fasting for me.

50:07.840 --> 50:11.840
 Anyway, but there's also health benefits to fasting.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.400
 I intermittent fast a lot.

50:13.400 --> 50:16.560
 I eat just one meal a day most of the time.

50:16.560 --> 50:18.920
 Is there something you can say about the benefits

50:18.920 --> 50:20.520
 of fasting in your own life

50:20.520 --> 50:23.520
 and in general, the anti aging process?

50:23.520 --> 50:25.640
 Well, you're a philosopher too.

50:25.640 --> 50:26.960
 Sorry, I apologize.

50:26.960 --> 50:30.400
 No, I'm impressed, true Renaissance man.

50:30.400 --> 50:32.000
 It's a joy to be here.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.480
 So when it comes to fasting,

50:33.480 --> 50:37.200
 this is being epistemious is one of the oldest ways

50:37.200 --> 50:38.480
 to improve health.

50:38.480 --> 50:41.600
 Probably they knew this 5,000 plus years ago.

50:41.600 --> 50:43.160
 So that's not new.

50:43.160 --> 50:45.640
 But what we're figuring out is what is optimal

50:45.640 --> 50:47.080
 and how does it work?

50:47.080 --> 50:49.560
 And one of the things we help contribute to,

50:49.560 --> 50:51.840
 which I can speak to with some authority,

50:51.840 --> 50:54.400
 is that these longevity genes we work on,

50:54.400 --> 50:58.600
 we showed back in the early 2000s are turned on by fasting.

50:58.600 --> 51:01.200
 And at least in yeast, we were the first to show

51:01.200 --> 51:03.320
 that how calorie restriction fasting works

51:03.320 --> 51:04.480
 to extend lifespan.

51:04.480 --> 51:06.480
 And that was the first for any species.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.200
 Something similar happens in our bodies.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.560
 When we're hungry or put our bodies

51:10.560 --> 51:12.680
 under any other perceived adversity,

51:12.680 --> 51:14.880
 such as running, our bodies think, wow,

51:14.880 --> 51:18.480
 we're getting chased by a sabertooth cat or something.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.000
 If we're really hot or cold,

51:21.000 --> 51:23.080
 these probably also work to put our bodies

51:23.080 --> 51:25.880
 in this defensive state to activate these genes

51:25.880 --> 51:28.640
 in the way that whales do and mice don't.

51:28.640 --> 51:31.320
 And so hunger is the best way to do that.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.760
 In fact, I don't think you have to feel hungry.

51:33.760 --> 51:35.320
 You can get used to it.

51:35.320 --> 51:38.280
 But if there was one thing I would recommend to anybody

51:38.280 --> 51:42.840
 to slow down aging would be to skip a meal or two a day.

51:42.840 --> 51:44.480
 Now, it doesn't mean you don't have to live well.

51:44.480 --> 51:47.720
 You can go out, I go to restaurants, I eat regular food.

51:47.720 --> 51:50.040
 I try to be as healthy as possible.

51:50.040 --> 51:53.400
 But I've gone from skipping breakfast most of my life

51:53.400 --> 51:55.480
 now to skipping lunch as well.

51:55.480 --> 51:59.320
 And I have my physique back that I had when I was 20.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.280
 I feel 20 mentally.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.560
 I'm much sharper.

52:02.560 --> 52:03.520
 I don't feel tired anymore.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.680
 I sleep well.

52:04.680 --> 52:07.560
 So I'm a huge fan of the one meal a day thing.

52:07.560 --> 52:11.160
 Where I'm not good at is going beyond one day.

52:11.160 --> 52:12.000
 But if you do three days.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.640
 Have you ever fasted longer than 24 hours?

52:15.640 --> 52:17.160
 I tried doing two days.

52:17.160 --> 52:20.200
 I might have made it to the third and given up.

52:20.200 --> 52:23.840
 I just find that I don't have a lot of willpower.

52:23.840 --> 52:24.880
 I also hate exercise.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.920
 So I'm not sure how long I'm going to live.

52:27.920 --> 52:29.280
 But I've managed to do one meal a day.

52:29.280 --> 52:33.120
 So if I can do that, seriously, anybody can do that.

52:33.120 --> 52:36.040
 To your listeners and viewers, I would say,

52:36.040 --> 52:38.120
 don't try to do it all at once.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.720
 You can't go from snacking and eating three meals a day

52:40.720 --> 52:42.880
 to what I do easily.

52:42.880 --> 52:44.040
 Work your way up to it.

52:44.040 --> 52:45.600
 But also compensate with drinking.

52:45.600 --> 52:48.880
 If you like tea, if you like coffee, put some milk in it.

52:48.880 --> 52:49.480
 That's fine.

52:49.480 --> 52:53.000
 You can fill your stomach up with liquids, diet sodas.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.800
 I get criticized for drinking, but I'm

52:54.800 --> 52:56.480
 going to continue to have those.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.240
 But I power through the day.

52:58.240 --> 52:59.680
 I definitely don't feel tired.

52:59.680 --> 53:00.800
 I don't have a lag anymore.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.640
 But also give it at least two weeks

53:02.640 --> 53:04.880
 because there's a habit as well.

53:04.880 --> 53:08.440
 Having something in your mouth chewing, feeling that fullness.

53:08.440 --> 53:09.480
 You can break that habit.

53:09.480 --> 53:12.040
 And within two, three weeks, you'll have done it.

53:12.040 --> 53:12.520
 Absolutely.

53:12.520 --> 53:14.440
 So I'm not actually even that strict about it.

53:14.440 --> 53:15.920
 You said diet soda.

53:15.920 --> 53:19.600
 Yeah, people are very weirdly strict about fasting the rules.

53:19.600 --> 53:23.800
 And fasting, like for example, I drink

53:23.800 --> 53:26.360
 element electrolytes when I was fasting.

53:26.360 --> 53:28.520
 And that has five calories.

53:28.520 --> 53:31.200
 And so technically, it's not fasting.

53:31.200 --> 53:34.480
 Or people will say, if you drink coffee, there's caffeine.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.920
 And they'll say, that's technically not fasting

53:36.920 --> 53:39.200
 because there's some kind of biological effects of caffeine,

53:39.200 --> 53:40.280
 but whatever.

53:40.280 --> 53:42.400
 Of course, there's biological benefits

53:42.400 --> 53:43.520
 that you can argue about.

53:43.520 --> 53:45.960
 But there's also just experiential benefits.

53:45.960 --> 53:48.800
 Just calorie restriction broadly

53:48.800 --> 53:52.440
 has a certain experience to it that, for me personally,

53:52.440 --> 53:55.160
 just as you said, has made me feel really good.

53:55.160 --> 54:01.400
 That said, especially I've gained quite a bit away,

54:01.400 --> 54:03.320
 maybe even like 15 pounds or something like that

54:03.320 --> 54:05.640
 since I moved to Austin, Texas.

54:05.640 --> 54:08.520
 And I still keep the same diet.

54:08.520 --> 54:12.840
 But I eat a lot of meat in that one

54:12.840 --> 54:14.040
 just because it's delicious.

54:14.040 --> 54:19.280
 Because it's also the amazing people I met in Texas.

54:19.280 --> 54:22.240
 It's just there's camaraderie, a friendship,

54:22.240 --> 54:25.640
 a love to the people that makes you really enjoy

54:25.640 --> 54:29.320
 the atmosphere of eating the brisket and the meat.

54:29.320 --> 54:31.040
 Is this Joe Rogan insisting?

54:31.040 --> 54:34.640
 Joe is very different.

54:34.640 --> 54:38.640
 Joe loves bread and pasta.

54:38.640 --> 54:44.200
 He knows that his body feels best doing keto or carnivore.

54:44.200 --> 54:47.360
 So that's what he usually tries to stick to.

54:47.360 --> 54:50.080
 But he also does not hold back.

54:50.080 --> 54:52.760
 And he'll just eat pasta when he does pasta.

54:52.760 --> 54:56.040
 And he sort of enjoys life in that way.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.800
 I don't know how to enjoy life in that way.

54:57.800 --> 55:01.760
 I also love pasta, but I'm just not going to enjoy it.

55:01.760 --> 55:06.000
 Because I know my body ultimately does not

55:06.000 --> 55:06.960
 feel good with pasta.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.320
 So it's a funny kind of dichotomies.

55:09.320 --> 55:16.120
 I would like to cheat, I guess, by eating more meat

55:16.120 --> 55:21.800
 than overeating on the things that I know my body feels

55:21.800 --> 55:24.880
 good on, as opposed to eating stuff I shouldn't, like cake

55:24.880 --> 55:26.400
 and all those kinds of things.

55:26.400 --> 55:32.520
 I tend to find happiness in overeating the good stuff

55:32.520 --> 55:35.960
 versus eating the bad stuff.

55:35.960 --> 55:37.800
 And that's the kind of balance.

55:37.800 --> 55:41.080
 Him, he's like, fuck it.

55:41.080 --> 55:43.400
 Every once in a while, you've got to enjoy it.

55:43.400 --> 55:48.960
 And then also coupled with that, for him, is just exercise,

55:48.960 --> 55:51.080
 like then faces demons the next day

55:51.080 --> 55:53.520
 and just burn a huge amount of calories.

55:53.520 --> 55:58.840
 Which is, I mean, whatever's up with that guy's mind,

55:58.840 --> 56:04.040
 there's an ability to fully experience life, which

56:04.040 --> 56:06.920
 is represented by the pasta, and the ability

56:06.920 --> 56:09.960
 to just fight the demons, which is represented

56:09.960 --> 56:13.000
 by all the crazy kettle balls and running the hills

56:13.000 --> 56:14.720
 and all this kind of stuff that he does.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.240
 That takes a lot out of you doing

56:16.240 --> 56:17.800
 that kind of insane exercise.

56:17.800 --> 56:21.880
 I think I'm more like you, or at least towards your direction,

56:21.880 --> 56:24.400
 is like, I really hate exercise.

56:24.400 --> 56:26.840
 So I do it, but I really hate it.

56:26.840 --> 56:29.640
 And so it's a balance that you have to strike.

56:29.640 --> 56:33.440
 Is there something you could say about the diet side of that?

56:33.440 --> 56:37.040
 For you personally, but in general,

56:37.040 --> 56:39.800
 in order to achieve calorie restriction,

56:39.800 --> 56:43.960
 like for me, eating, I know it may not sound healthy,

56:43.960 --> 56:47.840
 but eating carnivore, eating mostly meat,

56:47.840 --> 56:52.880
 has made me feel really good, both mentally and physically.

56:52.880 --> 56:56.240
 Is there something you could say about the kinds of diets

56:56.240 --> 57:01.160
 that may improve longevity, but also enable calorie restriction?

57:01.160 --> 57:02.840
 Well, sure.

57:02.840 --> 57:04.560
 I mean, the first thing that's important to know

57:04.560 --> 57:07.800
 is that while many people are interested

57:07.800 --> 57:11.240
 slash obsessed with what they eat,

57:11.240 --> 57:13.640
 the data that's come out of animal studies, at least,

57:13.640 --> 57:17.360
 is it's far more important when you eat than what you eat.

57:17.360 --> 57:20.120
 And this was a fantastic study a few years ago

57:20.120 --> 57:23.080
 by my friend Rafael de Cabo at the National Institutes

57:23.080 --> 57:24.760
 of Health in Bethesda.

57:24.760 --> 57:26.920
 And he had 10,000 mice on different diets,

57:26.920 --> 57:31.000
 hoping to find the perfect mix of carbs, protein, and fat.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.240
 And it turns out that the only ones that lived longer

57:33.240 --> 57:35.880
 were the ones that only ate once a day.

57:35.880 --> 57:37.960
 And so that, we're not mice,

57:37.960 --> 57:40.320
 but I think that we're close enough to mice

57:40.320 --> 57:42.640
 that this tells us a lot.

57:42.640 --> 57:44.920
 But okay, but I still think the best bang

57:44.920 --> 57:47.840
 for the longevity buck is to do both well,

57:47.840 --> 57:51.640
 eat less often and eat the right things.

57:51.640 --> 57:54.400
 Now I'll preface this to say, I'm not a nut about this.

57:54.400 --> 57:57.960
 I will eat occasionally, very occasionally a dessert.

57:57.960 --> 58:00.920
 Usually I steal from others, which doesn't count, right?

58:00.920 --> 58:01.760
 Exactly.

58:01.760 --> 58:03.040
 But you gotta live life, right?

58:03.040 --> 58:05.520
 What's a long life if it's not enjoyable anyway?

58:05.520 --> 58:08.880
 But I also have found, and I'll get to your question

58:08.880 --> 58:11.520
 in a second, but my microbiome right now

58:11.520 --> 58:14.520
 and stomach is at a point where if I try to overeat

58:14.520 --> 58:16.920
 on a steak, which I did a couple of days ago,

58:16.920 --> 58:21.920
 I actually had a fried chicken specifically.

58:22.320 --> 58:23.920
 For two days I felt terrible.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.080
 I couldn't sleep, it wouldn't go down.

58:26.080 --> 58:29.200
 So I'm now at a point where even if I want to binge on meat

58:29.200 --> 58:31.640
 and fried foods, I just can't, it just feels bad.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.320
 But what do I recommend?

58:34.320 --> 58:37.480
 Well, what the data says, which I try to follow is

58:38.440 --> 58:41.320
 that plant based foods will be better than meat based foods.

58:41.320 --> 58:43.920
 And I know that there are a lot of people who disagree.

58:43.920 --> 58:46.240
 But one of the facts is, there's a few facts.

58:46.240 --> 58:47.640
 One is that people who live a long time

58:47.640 --> 58:48.840
 tend to eat those type of diets,

58:48.840 --> 58:51.080
 Mediterranean or Canawa diet.

58:51.080 --> 58:53.960
 They're eating mostly plants with a little bit of meat

58:53.960 --> 58:56.000
 and not a lot of red meat.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.800
 And the other fact is that in animals,

58:57.800 --> 59:00.320
 we know that there's a mechanism

59:00.320 --> 59:02.880
 that's called M to a little M capital TOR

59:02.880 --> 59:05.440
 that responds to certain amino acids

59:05.440 --> 59:07.640
 that are found in more abundance in meat.

59:07.640 --> 59:10.280
 And when it responds, it actually shortens lifespan.

59:10.280 --> 59:11.560
 And the converse, if you starve it

59:11.560 --> 59:15.840
 of those three amino acids mostly in meat,

59:15.840 --> 59:17.560
 then it extends lifespan.

59:17.560 --> 59:19.480
 And there's a drug called rapamycin,

59:19.480 --> 59:22.760
 which some people are experimenting with that does that.

59:22.760 --> 59:25.560
 So you might be able to, I'm just saying this here

59:25.560 --> 59:27.680
 from all my colleagues, we don't know the results here,

59:27.680 --> 59:30.680
 but you could potentially take a rapamycin like drug

59:30.680 --> 59:34.320
 and counteract the effects of meat in the long run.

59:34.320 --> 59:35.840
 Don't know, we should try that actually.

59:35.840 --> 59:37.360
 We could do that in the lab.

59:37.360 --> 59:39.400
 But getting to the bottom of this,

59:39.400 --> 59:41.280
 what I think is going on is that

59:41.280 --> 59:42.960
 just like testosterone and growth hormone,

59:42.960 --> 59:47.120
 you will get temporary, maybe not temporary,

59:47.120 --> 59:48.600
 immediate health benefits.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.960
 You'll feel great, you'll get more muscle energy.

59:51.960 --> 59:54.360
 But the problem is, I think it's at the expense

59:54.360 --> 59:56.160
 of longterm health and longevity.

59:56.160 --> 59:59.880
 Well, this is actually something I worry about

59:59.880 --> 1:00:02.600
 in terms of longterm effects

1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:05.320
 or the cost in terms of longevity.

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:07.680
 It's very difficult to know how your choices affect

1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:12.160
 your longevity because the impact is down the line.

1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:16.920
 Like just because something makes me feel good now,

1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:19.680
 like eating only meat makes me feel good now,

1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:21.680
 I wonder what are the costs down the line?

1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:23.240
 Well, think about what I was saying

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:26.720
 about the tradeoffs between growth and reproduction,

1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:28.080
 which is what a mouse does,

1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:31.080
 and a whale that grows slowly, reproduces slowly,

1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:32.520
 lives a long time.

1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:34.560
 It's called the disposable soma theory.

1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:38.280
 Coke would just propose that in the 70s.

1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:41.640
 What meat probably does is put you in the mouse category,

1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:44.240
 super fertile, grow fast, heal fast,

1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:46.120
 and then if you want to be a whale,

1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:49.160
 you should restrict meat and do things

1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:52.720
 that promote the preservation of your body.

1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:57.720
 Is it difficult to eat a plant based diet

1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:01.960
 that you perform well under so mentally and physically?

1:01:01.960 --> 1:01:06.880
 Just almost, I'm asking almost like an anecdotal question.

1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:08.880
 All right, unless you know the science.

1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:12.200
 Well, the science is still being worked out,

1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:15.200
 but from the synthesis of everything that I've read,

1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:20.200
 I try to eat a diet that's definitely full of leafy greens,

1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:22.600
 particularly spinach is great

1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:25.840
 because it's got the iron that we need, plenty of vitamins.

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:30.840
 I also try to avoid too much fruit and berries,

1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:34.000
 particularly fruit juice,

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.920
 definitely avoid that sugar high.

1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:39.880
 Spiking your sugar is not healthy in the long run.

1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:42.080
 The other thing that's interesting is we discovered

1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:45.520
 what we called xeno hermetic molecules.

1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:47.560
 Let me unpack that because it's a terrible name

1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:51.760
 and I take full responsibility with my friend Conrad Howitz.

1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:53.920
 The xeno means cross species

1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:57.400
 and hormesis is the term that what doesn't kill you

1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:01.200
 makes you live longer and be healthier.

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:04.640
 And so we're getting cross species health improvements

1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:06.960
 by molecules that plants make.

1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:08.240
 And plants make these molecules

1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:11.840
 when they're also under adversity or perceived adversity.

1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:15.440
 For instance, I understand if you want really healthy

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:18.880
 or good oranges, you can drive nails into the bark

1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:20.400
 of the tree before you harvest.

1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:23.240
 Same with wine, you typically want them to be dry

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:25.960
 before you harvest or covered in fungus.

1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:28.840
 And that's because these plants make these colorful

1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:30.680
 and xeno hermetic molecules

1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:33.400
 that make themselves stress resistant,

1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:37.720
 turn on their sirtuin defenses, the sergines, remember?

1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:40.320
 And when we eat them, we get those same benefits.

1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:42.240
 That's the idea and we've evolved to do so.

1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:43.720
 This isn't a coincidence.

1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:47.040
 It's my theory, our theory that we want to know

1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:49.200
 when our food supply is under adversity

1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:51.960
 because we need to get ready for a famine.

1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:54.520
 And so we hunker down and preserve our body.

1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:55.800
 And by eating these colored food,

1:02:55.800 --> 1:02:58.760
 so practically speaking, if it's full of color,

1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:01.880
 if there's been some chewing by a caterpillar,

1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:04.960
 organic, grown locally in local farms,

1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:09.560
 I'll eat that versus a watery, insipid, light colored

1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:12.720
 lettuce that's been grown in California.

1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:14.520
 So you want vegetables that have suffered.

1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:16.720
 You want the David Goggins as vegetables.

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:19.320
 That's the xeno hermetic molecules.

1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:20.800
 I love that term.

1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:22.040
 I'm gonna take that one with me.

1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:23.360
 Thank you.

1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:25.000
 Yeah.

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:26.280
 Oh, I follow him on Instagram.

1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:27.400
 He's always screaming.

1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:29.920
 So you want the, that he's basically

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:34.880
 the xeno hermetic version of a human.

1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:36.920
 I like it.

1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:39.000
 So these are the molecules that are representative

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000
 of the stress that's been,

1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:44.560
 that a plant has been under.

1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:46.720
 Yeah, the best example of that is resveratrol,

1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:48.200
 which many people, including myself,

1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:49.720
 take as a supplement.

1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:52.720
 Grape, grapevines produce that in abundance

1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:55.840
 when they're dried out or they have too much light

1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:56.880
 or fungus.

1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:01.560
 And that we've shown activates the SOTU enzyme in our bodies,

1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:03.840
 which remember is what extends lifespan in yeast

1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:05.840
 and slows down aging in the brain.

1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:06.960
 That's beautiful.

1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:09.320
 Yeah, I tend to avoid fruit as well.

1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:12.720
 So green veggies, anything that's not very sweet.

1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:15.440
 So I would just say you're relatively low.

1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:19.200
 Like you try to avoid sugary things as well.

1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:21.520
 Yeah, I'm fairly militant about that.

1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:23.960
 I rarely would add sugar to anything.

1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:27.880
 Occasionally I would eat a slice of cheesecake,

1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:31.120
 but that would be maybe once or twice a year.

1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:32.960
 You have to give in occasionally.

1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:34.800
 But yeah, anything that's sweet,

1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:37.480
 I would rather substitute something like stevia

1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:38.680
 if I need a sugar hit.

1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:42.440
 What about exercise?

1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:43.600
 Your favorite topic?

1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:47.480
 I don't like talking about it.

1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:49.240
 Yeah, okay, great.

1:04:49.240 --> 1:04:53.520
 Is there benefits to longevity from exercise?

1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:55.960
 Well, no doubt, that's proven.

1:04:55.960 --> 1:04:59.240
 Just like fasting, it's pretty clear that that works.

1:04:59.240 --> 1:05:01.880
 For example, there are studies of cyclists.

1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:06.200
 It was something like people that cycle over 80 miles a week

1:05:06.200 --> 1:05:08.880
 have a 40% reduction in a variety of diseases,

1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:10.400
 certainly heart disease.

1:05:10.400 --> 1:05:11.640
 So that's not even a question.

1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:13.520
 But what's interesting is that we're learning

1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:15.680
 that you don't need much to have a big benefit.

1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:17.520
 It's an asymptotic curve.

1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:19.200
 And in fact, if you overdo it,

1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:20.680
 you probably have reduced benefits,

1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:22.160
 particularly if you start to wear out joints,

1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:23.520
 that kind of thing.

1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:25.760
 But just 10 minutes on a treadmill a few times a week,

1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:28.600
 getting your, lose your breath, get hypoxic as it's called,

1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:32.640
 seems to be very beneficial for long term health.

1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:35.640
 And that's the kind of exercise that I like to do.

1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:36.480
 Yeah, aerobic.

1:05:36.480 --> 1:05:38.520
 Though I do enjoy lifting weights.

1:05:38.520 --> 1:05:40.920
 So that is what I call my exercise,

1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:41.880
 which has other benefits,

1:05:41.880 --> 1:05:46.240
 including maintaining hormone levels, male hormone levels.

1:05:46.240 --> 1:05:50.720
 But also really why I do it is I want to be able to

1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:53.480
 counteract the effects of sitting for most of the day.

1:05:53.480 --> 1:05:55.760
 And as you get older, you lose muscle mass.

1:05:55.760 --> 1:05:57.680
 It's a percent or so a year.

1:05:57.680 --> 1:05:59.440
 And I don't want to be frail when I'm older

1:05:59.440 --> 1:06:00.840
 and fall over and break my hip,

1:06:00.840 --> 1:06:04.120
 which happens every 20 seconds in this country.

1:06:04.120 --> 1:06:05.480
 So maintaining that strength,

1:06:05.480 --> 1:06:07.960
 but also doing the cardio for the longevity,

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:10.160
 for the avoiding the heart disease.

1:06:10.160 --> 1:06:13.080
 Yeah, I definitely just like with fasting,

1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:15.640
 have the philosophical benefit of running long

1:06:15.640 --> 1:06:17.120
 and running slow.

1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:19.360
 I enjoy it because it kind of clears the mind

1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:20.600
 and allows you to think,

1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:23.040
 actually listen to brown noise as I run.

1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:26.400
 It really helps remove myself from the world

1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:28.760
 and just like zoom in on particular thoughts.

1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:30.040
 What are these brown noise?

1:06:30.040 --> 1:06:31.920
 It's like white noise, but deeper.

1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:34.040
 So like the white noise is like,

1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:36.760
 shh, and then brown noise is more like,

1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:39.960
 like ocean.

1:06:39.960 --> 1:06:40.800
 That sounds great.

1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:41.760
 I might try that.

1:06:41.760 --> 1:06:42.600
 Yeah.

1:06:42.600 --> 1:06:43.680
 Yeah, it's a...

1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:44.920
 It's more soothing probably.

1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:45.760
 I'm not sure.

1:06:45.760 --> 1:06:46.600
 There could be science to this.

1:06:46.600 --> 1:06:47.640
 I need to look this up.

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:48.880
 I've been meaning to,

1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:50.520
 but when I started,

1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:53.840
 this is maybe like five years ago,

1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:56.080
 I started listening to brown noise when I work.

1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:58.400
 And the first time I listened to it,

1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:00.280
 something happened to my mind

1:07:00.280 --> 1:07:03.720
 where it just went like zoomed in

1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:07.840
 to like in a way that it felt like really weird,

1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:12.640
 like how precisely it was able to sort of remove

1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:16.560
 the distractions of the world and really help my mind.

1:07:16.560 --> 1:07:19.640
 Obviously, like the mind is trying to focus

1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:21.800
 and then it just enabled that process

1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:24.480
 of trying to focus on a particular problem.

1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:26.320
 I don't know if this is generalizable to others.

1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:29.040
 People should definitely try it if you're listening to this.

1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:30.240
 Maybe it's just my own mind,

1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:34.480
 but it's funny like it made me,

1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:35.840
 brown noise made me realize

1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:38.680
 that there's probably hacks out there

1:07:38.680 --> 1:07:41.840
 that work for me that I should be constantly looking for.

1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:46.840
 It's almost like an encouraging and motivating of event

1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:49.960
 that maybe there's other stuff out there.

1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:52.800
 Maybe there's other brown noise like things out there

1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:56.080
 that truly like almost immediately make me feel better.

1:07:56.080 --> 1:07:57.800
 I don't know if it's generalizable to others,

1:07:57.800 --> 1:08:00.520
 but it does seem that it's the case

1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:03.200
 that there's probably for many others

1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:05.840
 things like that that could be discovered.

1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:10.320
 And so it's always disappointing when I find things in life

1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:12.880
 that I wish I would have found earlier.

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:17.280
 Like I got LASIK eye surgery a few years ago

1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:19.360
 and the first thought I had like the next day

1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:21.720
 when I woke up is like, damn it,

1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:24.120
 why didn't I do this way earlier?

1:08:24.120 --> 1:08:27.240
 There's all this stuff of that nature

1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:29.560
 that there are yet to be discovered.

1:08:29.560 --> 1:08:31.680
 So it pays to explore.

1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:32.960
 Yeah, though you have a different mind.

1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.480
 You have quite a beautiful mind.

1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:37.120
 So I suspect brown noise helps you focus

1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:39.120
 and cause you're probably all over the place

1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:40.200
 if you don't control it.

1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:41.040
 Yeah, exactly.

1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:42.320
 It means something about it.

1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:43.440
 It's a programmer thing.

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:48.440
 I don't, a programming is a really difficult mental journey

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:52.880
 cause you have to keep a lot of things in mind.

1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:56.480
 You have to, so you're constantly designing things

1:08:56.480 --> 1:08:58.080
 and you have to be extremely precise

1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:01.080
 by making those things concrete in code.

1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:05.120
 You also have to look stuff up on the internet

1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:08.680
 to sort of feed like information

1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:10.400
 and looking up stuff on the internet.

1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:12.360
 The internet is full of like distracting things.

1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:13.760
 So you have to be really focused

1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:16.760
 in the way you look stuff up in pulling that information in.

1:09:16.760 --> 1:09:19.080
 So it requires a certain discipline

1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:23.400
 and a certain focus that I've been very much exploring

1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:26.320
 how to do, like I do it really well in the morning,

1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:28.280
 coffee is involved, all those kinds of things.

1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:29.640
 You're trying to optimize,

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:33.560
 keeping very positive, inspired, no social media,

1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:36.120
 all those kinds of things and trying to optimize for.

1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:38.640
 And everybody has their own kind of little journey

1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:40.520
 that they try to understand.

1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:41.960
 You get this from like writers

1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:45.800
 when you read about the habits of writers,

1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:47.840
 like the habits they do in the morning.

1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:49.800
 They usually write like two, three, four hours a day

1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:50.960
 and that's it.

1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:53.440
 It's like they optimize that ritual.

1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:55.440
 And then there's always Hunter Stompson.

1:09:55.440 --> 1:10:00.440
 So sometimes it pays off to be wild.

1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:04.560
 What about sleep?

1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:06.720
 How important is sleep for longevity?

1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:10.720
 I would guess based on the evidence

1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:12.160
 that it's really important

1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:15.040
 and because we don't know for sure.

1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:17.560
 But what we know from animal studies is the following.

1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:20.240
 If you restrict sleep from a rat for just two weeks,

1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:22.160
 it'll develop type two diabetes.

1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:23.360
 It's that important.

1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:25.840
 So that's the main thing.

1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:28.480
 What we also know is at the molecular level

1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:33.360
 that if you disrupt your sleep wake cycle,

1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:35.120
 so we actually have proteins that go up and down

1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:36.720
 that control our sleep wake.

1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:39.240
 All of us, most of ourselves do that.

1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:42.480
 If you disrupt that, you'll get premature aging.

1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:43.320
 And guess what?

1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:44.160
 The opposite is true.

1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:46.760
 That as you get older, that cycle,

1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:49.480
 the amplitude becomes diminished.

1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:51.880
 And this is why it's harder to get to sleep as you get older

1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:54.480
 and then you got all sorts of problems.

1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:56.920
 And I think what's going on is there's positive feedback loop

1:10:56.920 --> 1:10:59.440
 which is a disaster in your old age,

1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:02.040
 which is right, you're aging.

1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:05.760
 You can't at this moment totally prevent that.

1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:06.880
 And then it's disrupting your sleep

1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:08.000
 and you get not enough sleep

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.480
 and then that's gonna accelerate your aging process.

1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:13.720
 And so it's known that people who are shift workers

1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:17.560
 are more susceptible to certain age related diseases.

1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:19.960
 So your bottom line, you definitely wanna work on that.

1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:21.840
 It's one of the reasons I have this ring on my finger

1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:23.320
 which helps me optimize my sleep

1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:25.880
 and learn what I do the day before

1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:28.400
 if it was a bad idea and I'll stop doing that

1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:29.760
 like eating a fried chicken.

1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:34.840
 I see you're still carrying the burdens of that decision.

1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:37.920
 But yeah, sleep is one of those things

1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:41.600
 that's making me wonder about the variability

1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:43.160
 between humans a little bit

1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:46.080
 and how science is often focused on,

1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:51.520
 like it's not often focused on high performers

1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:52.640
 in a particular way.

1:11:53.640 --> 1:11:55.240
 And it's looking at the aggregate

1:11:55.240 --> 1:11:56.960
 versus the individual cases.

1:11:57.880 --> 1:11:59.400
 For example, like for me,

1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:01.000
 I don't know what the exact hours are,

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:04.320
 but like power naps are incredible.

1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:10.720
 I tend to look at the metric of stress and happiness

1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:13.120
 and joy and try to optimize those.

1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:16.040
 So decreasing stress, increasing happiness

1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:20.200
 and using sleep as just one of the tools to do that

1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:23.760
 because like hitting the five, six, seven, eight,

1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:27.240
 nine hour mark or whatever the correct mark is,

1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:30.040
 I find that to be stress inducing for me

1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:34.240
 versus stress relieving, like thinking about that.

1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:37.360
 I feel best if I sleep sometimes for eight hours,

1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:39.640
 sometimes for four hours in the power nap.

1:12:39.640 --> 1:12:42.640
 And as long as I have a stupid private,

1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:44.520
 usually smile on my face,

1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:46.240
 that's what I'm doing good

1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:49.520
 as opposed to getting a perfect amount of sleep

1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:53.360
 according to whatever the latest blog post is.

1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:55.440
 And I also pull all nighters still.

1:12:56.560 --> 1:12:59.400
 I also think there's something about the body,

1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:02.920
 like as long as you do it regularly,

1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:04.480
 it's not as stress inducing.

1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:06.880
 Like you know what it is.

1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:09.040
 The reason I pull all nighters isn't for like,

1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:11.640
 I'm playing Diablo three or something

1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:14.040
 is because I'm doing something I'm truly passionate about.

1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:15.920
 Well, like I'm also love video games,

1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:18.520
 but I'm doing something I'm truly passionate about.

1:13:18.520 --> 1:13:21.480
 And it's almost like there's the jockel willing feeling

1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:23.760
 of when I'm up at seven AM

1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:27.240
 and I haven't slept all night and still I'm working on it.

1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:29.560
 There's a kind of a celebration of the human spirit

1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:31.120
 that I really enjoy it.

1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:33.800
 Like, and that's happiness.

1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:36.040
 And to sort of then,

1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:38.040
 and I usually don't tell that kind of stuff to people

1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:40.920
 because their first statement will be like,

1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:42.640
 you should get more sleep.

1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:46.280
 It's like, no, I'm doing stuff I love.

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:49.040
 You should get more love in your life, bro.

1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:50.480
 That's right.

1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:52.600
 So, but that said, in aggregate,

1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:55.440
 when you look at the full span of life,

1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:58.120
 it's probably you should be getting

1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:00.800
 a consistent amount of sleep.

1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:05.000
 And it seems like it's in that seven, eight hour range.

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.760
 Yeah, but it's similar to food.

1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:09.400
 It's the quality, not the quantity.

1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:10.800
 And when you get it.

1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:14.520
 So I look at my data pretty often.

1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:17.200
 And what makes a difference to me is not the amount of hours

1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:20.480
 but the quality, the depth and the deep sleep

1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:22.000
 is what will do it.

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.920
 So if I have a lot of alcohol before going to sleep

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:26.440
 and I can see my heart rate being different,

1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:28.280
 but what really kills me is that I don't get

1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:30.560
 a lot of that deep sleep and I wake up,

1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:32.480
 you know, barely remembering stuff.

1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:34.480
 So that, like you say, if you're happy and contented

1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:37.200
 and you're not done have these cortisol chemicals

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:38.440
 going through your body,

1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:40.760
 you will more naturally get into that deep state.

1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:42.360
 And even if you just get four hours,

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:45.440
 way better than eight hours of none of that.

1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:46.800
 Yeah, that's beautiful.

1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:48.240
 And some of that could be genetic.

1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:52.120
 For me, I just fall asleep like this.

1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:54.160
 If you want me to fall asleep right now, I can do it.

1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:57.360
 It's no, I have no problem with it.

1:14:57.360 --> 1:14:59.320
 Combined with coffee, I just had two energy drinks

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:01.480
 I can probably sleep.

1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:03.560
 So that, I don't know if that's genetics

1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:07.560
 or it's kind of, I don't know what it is.

1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:09.720
 Or maybe that I don't have kids that I'm single.

1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:12.440
 So I don't have, I'm almost listening to some kind

1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:15.360
 of biological signal versus societal signal.

1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:17.080
 I'm not supposed to go to sleep.

1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:20.680
 So I just go to sleep whenever I feel like going to sleep.

1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:22.480
 Well, that's cause you're self employed.

1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:23.320
 Self employed.

1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:24.640
 Most people don't have that luxury,

1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:27.600
 but we're lucky the two of us that we can make our own hours.

1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:28.440
 Yeah.

1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:29.800
 But yeah, it's super important.

1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:32.360
 And those people who have the shift work,

1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:35.480
 I mean, they really need to change the way that works

1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:37.800
 because they're literally killing those people.

1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:42.800
 Is there something you can say about the mind and stress

1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:48.360
 in terms of effect on longevity?

1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:52.520
 Sort of, cause I don't know if you think about it this way,

1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:55.080
 but when you talk about the biological machine,

1:15:55.080 --> 1:15:57.800
 it's always these mechanisms that don't,

1:15:57.800 --> 1:16:00.920
 are not necessarily directly connected to the brain

1:16:00.920 --> 1:16:02.640
 or the operation of the brain.

1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:06.320
 Like what's the role about stress and happiness

1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:10.760
 and yeah, the sort of higher cognitive things

1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:13.080
 going on in the brain on longevity.

1:16:14.280 --> 1:16:15.120
 Right.

1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:16.240
 Well, that's a great point.

1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:18.760
 The brain is the center for longevity actually.

1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:22.800
 We do know that first off, when I'm stressed,

1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:24.680
 I can see mentally stressed,

1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:27.120
 then I can see it in my body.

1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:29.560
 Heart rate, hormones, it's clear.

1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:31.440
 That's no true surprise.

1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:34.000
 So you've got to work on your brain first and foremost.

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:39.000
 If you are totally freaked out, agitated all the time,

1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:41.160
 you will live shorter.

1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:42.520
 I'm certain of it.

1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:47.520
 I keep fish, I'm a big aquarium guy.

1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:48.360
 And you can see the difference

1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:51.480
 between the fish that's having a good time and dominant

1:16:51.480 --> 1:16:53.360
 and one that gets picked on.

1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:55.240
 It just looks like crap.

1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:57.600
 You don't want to be the little fish getting picked on

1:16:57.600 --> 1:16:58.680
 if you can help it.

1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:00.960
 So I used to be extremely stressed as a kid.

1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:03.400
 I was a perfectionist, very shy,

1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:06.160
 always worried about being a failure.

1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:08.760
 If I didn't get an A+, I was crying in my bedroom,

1:17:08.760 --> 1:17:11.040
 that kind of sad existence.

1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:13.440
 I got into my 20s, picked then in my 30s

1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:15.840
 and realized that's not the way to live.

1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:18.040
 So I've worked very hard to get to this point

1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:21.280
 where I almost never get stressed, never.

1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:23.680
 There's nothing that, I've never gotten angry in my lab.

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:24.680
 I've got 20 kids.

1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:26.840
 Sometimes it's like a, most of the time

1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:28.880
 it's like a kindergarten.

1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:30.560
 I haven't lost my temper.

1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:32.960
 I'm very calm, but that's intentional.

1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:35.000
 And I don't worry about stuff.

1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.000
 Millions of dollars, billions of dollars at stake sometimes.

1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:39.960
 Keep it cool.

1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:40.800
 It's only life.

1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:42.800
 We're all headed to the same place anyway.

1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:44.320
 Don't worry about it.

1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:47.800
 But to answer your question, I think in a better way,

1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:49.800
 if you manipulate the brain of an animal,

1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:51.600
 I'll give you an example.

1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:53.840
 If we turn on this certain gene that I mentioned,

1:17:53.840 --> 1:17:56.720
 sort one, we, a good friend of mine at Wash U,

1:17:56.720 --> 1:17:58.120
 Sheena Mai did this.

1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:01.840
 They upregulated that gene just in the neurons

1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:04.800
 of the animal, it lived longer.

1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:06.960
 So that's sufficient to extend lifespan.

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:10.040
 We also know that you can manipulate the part of the brain

1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:12.720
 called the hypothalamus, which leaches a lot of chemicals

1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:17.120
 into the body and proteins, most of which we don't know yet,

1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:19.720
 but just changing the inflammation of that little organ

1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:22.920
 or part of the brain is sufficient

1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:24.960
 to make animals live longer as well.

1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:26.520
 So get your brain in order first

1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:29.480
 before you tackle anything else, I would say.

1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:33.120
 So you kind of mentioned this with the inside tracker,

1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:36.200
 there's a ability to take blood measurement

1:18:36.200 --> 1:18:40.360
 and then infer from that a bunch of different things

1:18:40.360 --> 1:18:42.520
 about your body, how you can improve,

1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:44.720
 how you can improve the longevity.

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:49.200
 And you've also mentioned saliva in more efficient ways

1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.520
 to get data.

1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:55.440
 What does that involve?

1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:57.160
 What's the future of data collection?

1:18:57.160 --> 1:18:59.600
 Yeah, for the human biological system.

1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:01.640
 Well, yeah, the issue with blood

1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:03.400
 is you need someone to take it.

1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:06.080
 I mean, already prick your finger, which hurts.

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:07.120
 So you've got to have something better.

1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:09.000
 So I think what the future looks like

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:12.360
 is that you'll spit onto a little piece of paper

1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:14.760
 and stick it in a machine, it'll do that for you.

1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:15.600
 But we're not there yet.

1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:20.600
 So the intermediate future that I'm building right now

1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:24.200
 is that you would take a swab of the inside of your mouth,

1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:26.760
 which is the easiest way to take cells out of your body

1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:28.360
 and just ship them off.

1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:30.800
 Okay, so it's called a buckle swab.

1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:33.560
 I think we became very used to that right now

1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:35.760
 because of COVID, people don't like going to the doctor

1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:36.920
 as much, they don't like going out,

1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:38.800
 they just want to have home tests.

1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:40.760
 And so that I think is the next 10 years

1:19:40.760 --> 1:19:43.120
 where you'll get a kit in the mail,

1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:45.280
 you'll swab your cheek, stick it back in an envelope,

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:47.400
 send it off and a week later,

1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:52.400
 you have either a doctor's report or a health recommendation.

1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:54.960
 And what can you get off a cheek swab?

1:19:54.960 --> 1:19:55.800
 Well, you can get anything,

1:19:55.800 --> 1:19:58.360
 you can get hormones, stress levels,

1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:00.880
 stress hormones, blood glucose levels.

1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:03.880
 You can also tell your age reasonably accurately

1:20:03.880 --> 1:20:05.880
 doing that, actually quite accurately.

1:20:05.880 --> 1:20:08.200
 And those clocks cannot just tell you

1:20:08.200 --> 1:20:10.160
 how you're doing over time,

1:20:10.160 --> 1:20:12.160
 but can be used to give you recommendations

1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:14.160
 to slow that process down.

1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:16.560
 Cause some people sometimes are 10 years older biologically

1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:19.560
 than their actual chronological age.

1:20:19.560 --> 1:20:21.880
 I mean, why does it matter how many times

1:20:21.880 --> 1:20:23.680
 the earth's gone around the sun seriously?

1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:24.880
 Who cares about birthdays?

1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:27.200
 It's how long your body's clock has been ticking

1:20:27.200 --> 1:20:28.520
 and how fast.

1:20:28.520 --> 1:20:30.560
 So I could take a cheek swab from you today,

1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:32.720
 Lex, take it back to my lab.

1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:35.360
 And we then by tomorrow tell you

1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:36.840
 how old you are biologically

1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:40.880
 based on what we call the epigenetic clock.

1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:43.080
 And you might be freaked out, you might be happy,

1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:45.560
 but either way, we can advise you

1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:47.800
 on how to improve the trajectory.

1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:49.360
 Cause we know that smoking increases

1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:50.840
 the speed of that clock.

1:20:50.840 --> 1:20:54.200
 We also know that fasting and people who eat the right foods

1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:55.960
 have a slower clock.

1:20:55.960 --> 1:20:58.400
 Without that knowledge, you're flying blind.

1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:01.000
 But I like the idea of a swab cause it's just so easy.

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.560
 We've, a lot of us have done something like that

1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:03.400
 for COVID tests.

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:04.240
 It's not a big deal.

1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:06.160
 I've been doing a lot of rapid antigen tests.

1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:11.040
 So let me say that particular one rapid antigen tests,

1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:12.680
 they've been a source of frustration for me

1:21:12.680 --> 1:21:14.840
 because like everybody should be doing it.

1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:16.080
 It's so easy.

1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:17.280
 We've also been working in my lab

1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:19.120
 on democratizing these tests

1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:22.080
 to bring them down from a few hundred bucks to a dollar.

1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:24.280
 So just to clarify, you're talking about not research,

1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:25.800
 you're talking about like company stuff,

1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:28.600
 like actual consumer facing things.

1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:29.440
 Well, right.

1:21:29.440 --> 1:21:31.000
 The research on bringing the price down

1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:32.920
 has occurred in my lab at Harvard.

1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:35.080
 And then that intellectual property is being licensed

1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:37.160
 and has been licensed out to a company

1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:40.320
 that will be consumer facing.

1:21:40.320 --> 1:21:43.320
 So anybody for a small amount of money can do this.

1:21:43.320 --> 1:21:46.400
 Well, you got subscriber number one obsessed.

1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:48.640
 I think that's a beautiful, beautiful idea.

1:21:48.640 --> 1:21:51.480
 So somebody who maybe I would have been more hesitant

1:21:51.480 --> 1:21:56.320
 about it until COVID, but the home tests are super easy.

1:21:56.320 --> 1:21:59.360
 I almost wanted to share that data with the world,

1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:01.800
 like in some way, not the entirety of the data,

1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:05.760
 but like some visualization of like how I'm doing.

1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:08.840
 Like it's almost like, like, you know,

1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:10.600
 when you share if you had like a long run

1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:11.440
 or something like that,

1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:14.560
 I wish I could share because it inspires others

1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:16.880
 and then you can have a conversation about like,

1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:18.800
 well, what are the hacks that you've tried

1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:20.440
 and have a conversation about like

1:22:20.440 --> 1:22:22.480
 how to improve lifestyle and those kinds of things

1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:23.640
 that's grounded in data.

1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:25.600
 That's exactly, that's what's gonna happen.

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:27.440
 Now, everything's anonymous, of course.

1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:29.600
 We talked about security there,

1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:32.560
 but once it's anonymized, you can then plot these numbers.

1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:35.600
 And I've plotted my epigenetic age

1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:39.080
 versus hundreds of other people who have taken this test now.

1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:41.440
 And I can tell you where I fit relative to others

1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:43.600
 in terms of my biological age.

1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:45.080
 And I'm happy to share that with you all

1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:46.360
 because it's pretty low.

1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:48.520
 You can choose to share it, of course,

1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:50.480
 not everyone wants to share that.

1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:52.280
 But when you go to the doctor,

1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:54.880
 first of all, your doctor does treat you

1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:56.000
 as though you're an average person

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.640
 and none of us are average, there's no such thing.

1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:00.360
 But second of all, we never know

1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:01.800
 how we're doing relative to others

1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:05.840
 because we all, most of us, we don't share our information.

1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:08.080
 So we might have this number and that number,

1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:11.320
 but do you know that your numbers are good for your age or not?

1:23:11.320 --> 1:23:12.760
 You have no idea.

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:14.560
 Even your doctor probably doesn't even know.

1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:16.400
 So this graph that I'm talking about

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:18.080
 is the beginning of a world where you can say,

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:19.400
 how am I doing?

1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:21.200
 I'm a, you know, for the two of us,

1:23:21.200 --> 1:23:24.480
 we're white and we're male and we're this age.

1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:27.000
 And we do this, are we good?

1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:28.640
 Are we doing the right things or the wrong things?

1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:30.480
 Do we need to fix certain things?

1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:32.160
 And this is what the future is.

1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:35.400
 It's forget about just experimenting

1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:36.320
 and not knowing the result.

1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:37.320
 I mean, who doesn't experiment

1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:38.560
 and doesn't look at the data?

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:40.240
 No one, it makes no sense.

1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:42.200
 So we're gonna enter a world where we have a dashboard

1:23:42.200 --> 1:23:45.480
 on our body, the swabs, the blood tests,

1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:48.520
 the biosensors where our doctors can look at that,

1:23:48.520 --> 1:23:51.360
 but we can also look at it and they can recommend,

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:52.960
 you know, go to this restaurant down the road.

1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:54.400
 They've got this great meal.

1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:56.280
 It's high in whatever you need today

1:23:56.280 --> 1:23:58.480
 because you're lacking vitamin D and vitamin K2.

1:23:58.480 --> 1:23:59.320
 Go for it.

1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:03.240
 Ridiculous question or perhaps not.

1:24:03.240 --> 1:24:05.080
 If you look maybe 50 years from now

1:24:05.080 --> 1:24:07.760
 or a hundred years from now, a person born then,

1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:09.280
 what do you think is a good goal

1:24:09.280 --> 1:24:12.320
 in terms of how long a person would live?

1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:14.720
 Like what is the maximum longevity

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:17.360
 that we can achieve through the methods

1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:19.840
 that we have today of,

1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:21.120
 or are developing some of the things

1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:25.120
 we've been talking about in terms of genetics,

1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:26.520
 in terms of biology?

1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:28.160
 What's, is there a number?

1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:31.760
 Right, well, so it changes all the time

1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:33.440
 because technology's changing so quickly.

1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:36.240
 I keep revising the number upward,

1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:38.680
 but I would say that if you do the right things

1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:41.760
 during your life and start at an early age, let's say 25,

1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:43.280
 we don't want malnutrition starvation.

1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:45.200
 That's not what I'm talking about.

1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:48.880
 But in your 20s, start eating the kind of diets

1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:51.920
 that I talked about, skipping meals.

1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:55.960
 In animals, that gives you an extra 20 to 30%.

1:24:55.960 --> 1:24:57.880
 We don't know if that's true for humans

1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:00.880
 and that would, even 5% more would be a good,

1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:02.160
 a big deal for the planet.

1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:06.680
 I think that we should all aim to at least reach a century.

1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:09.400
 I'm a little bit behind.

1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:12.080
 I was born too early to benefit the most

1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:13.880
 from all of this discovery.

1:25:13.880 --> 1:25:16.040
 Those of you who are in your 20s,

1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:18.720
 you should definitely aim to reach 100.

1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:19.720
 I don't see why not.

1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:23.200
 Consider this, this is really important.

1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:25.080
 The average lifespan of a human

1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:28.160
 that looks after themselves but doesn't pay attention

1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:31.040
 is about 80, okay?

1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:34.200
 Japan, that's the average age for a male bit higher.

1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:37.240
 If you do the right things in your life,

1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:41.160
 which is eat healthy food, don't overeat,

1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:42.960
 don't become obese, do a bit of exercise,

1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:44.760
 get good sleep and don't stress.

1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:47.280
 That gives you, on average, 14 extra years.

1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:49.120
 That gets you to 94.

1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:51.160
 So, getting to 100, if you just focus

1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:53.760
 on what I'm talking about, it's not a big deal.

1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:54.680
 So, what's the maximum?

1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:57.440
 Well, we know that one human made it to 122

1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:00.440
 and a number of them make it into their teens.

1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:02.200
 I think that's also the next level

1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:06.360
 of where we can get to with the types of technologies

1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:07.640
 that I'm talking about.

1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:10.040
 Medicines, like I mentioned, Rappamycin,

1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.880
 is one called Metformin, which is the diabetes drug,

1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:14.440
 which I take.

1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:16.480
 That, in combination with these lifestyle changes,

1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:18.400
 should get us beyond 100.

1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:19.680
 How long can we ultimately live?

1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:22.280
 Well, there's no maximum limit to human lifespan.

1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:24.640
 Why can a whale live 300 years, but we cannot?

1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:26.280
 We're basically the same structure.

1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:28.000
 We just need to learn from them.

1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.120
 So, anyone who says, oh, you max out at X,

1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:33.320
 I think is full of it.

1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:35.080
 There's nothing that I've seen

1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:37.560
 that says biological organisms have to die.

1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:39.560
 There are trees that live for thousands of years

1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:42.520
 and their biochemistry is pretty close to ours.

1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:45.000
 What do you think it means to live for a very long time?

1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.320
 Let's say if it's 200 years we're talking about

1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:52.320
 or 1,000 years, there's some sense,

1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:56.760
 you could argue that there is immortal organisms

1:26:56.760 --> 1:26:59.080
 already living on earth, like there's bacteria.

1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:03.760
 So, there's certain living organisms

1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:08.000
 that in some fundamental way do not die

1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.360
 because they keep replicating their genetic,

1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:12.160
 they keep like cloning themselves.

1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:18.800
 Is it the same human if we can somehow persist

1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:23.880
 the human mind, like copy clone certain aspects

1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:26.360
 and just keep replacing body parts?

1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:30.400
 Do you think that's another way to achieve immortality,

1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:33.720
 to achieve of a prolonged sort of increased longevity

1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:37.080
 is to replace the parts that break easily

1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:39.960
 and keep, because actually from your theory

1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:44.400
 of aging as degradation of information,

1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:46.520
 it's an information theory view of aging,

1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:51.440
 like what is the key information that makes a human?

1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:53.400
 Can we persist that information

1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:56.160
 and just replace the trivial parts?

1:27:57.280 --> 1:27:59.320
 Yeah, I mean, the short answer is yes.

1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:01.320
 We're already replacing body parts,

1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:03.800
 but what makes us human is our brain.

1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:07.320
 Everything else is suboptimal, except our brain.

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:13.640
 The ability to replace actual neurons is really hard.

1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:16.200
 All right, I think it might be easy to upload

1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:19.120
 rather than replace neurons because they're so tight,

1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:22.200
 it's such a network and just perturbing the system.

1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:27.600
 It's frozen, Gizcat, you change everything

1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:28.720
 once you get in there.

1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:31.760
 The problem is, well, I guess the solution,

1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:34.160
 let me go to the solution, that's more interesting.

1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:36.320
 What we're learning is that if you reverse the age

1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:40.440
 of nerve cells, it looks like they get their memories back.

1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:42.600
 So the memories are not lost,

1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:45.280
 they're just that the cells don't know how to interpret them

1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:46.920
 and function correctly.

1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:48.800
 And this is one of the things we're studying in my lab,

1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:50.400
 if you take an old mouse that has learned something

1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:53.640
 when it was young, but forgotten, does it get that back?

1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:56.440
 And all evidence points to that being true.

1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:59.000
 So I'd rather go in and rejuvenate the brain

1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:01.240
 as it sits rather than replace individual cells,

1:29:01.240 --> 1:29:03.080
 which would be really hard.

1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:06.680
 What do you think about efforts like Neuralink,

1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:10.200
 which basically, you mentioned uploading,

1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:11.720
 are trying to figure out,

1:29:11.720 --> 1:29:13.640
 so creating brain computer interfaces,

1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:15.680
 they're trying to figure out how to communicate

1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:18.080
 with the brain, but one of the features of that

1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:22.720
 is trying to record the human brain more and more accurately.

1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:27.720
 Do you have hope for that to, of course it will lead

1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:31.440
 to us better understanding from a neuroscience perspective

1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:33.760
 of the human mind, but do you have hope for it

1:29:33.760 --> 1:29:37.360
 to increase longevity in terms of how it's used?

1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:40.120
 I think that it can help with certain diseases.

1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:42.120
 But I see, at least within our lifetime,

1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:44.800
 that's the best use of it, is to be able to replace parts

1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:46.960
 of the body that are not functioning,

1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:49.400
 such as the retina and other parts,

1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:52.960
 the visual cortex back here, that's going to be doable.

1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:56.040
 In terms of longevity, maybe we could put something

1:29:56.040 --> 1:29:59.600
 on the hypothalamus and start secreting those hormones

1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:00.560
 and get that back.

1:30:02.280 --> 1:30:06.760
 Ultimately, I think the best way to preserve the brain

1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:10.760
 is going to be to record it,

1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:12.680
 but also, I think it's going to require death,

1:30:12.680 --> 1:30:16.960
 unfortunately, to then do very detailed scans,

1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:19.200
 even if you have enough time and money,

1:30:19.200 --> 1:30:22.520
 atomic microscopy, and rebuild the brain from scratch.

1:30:22.520 --> 1:30:24.320
 Rebuild from scratch, yeah.

1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:28.040
 I mean, we are living more and more in a digital world.

1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:31.520
 I wonder if the scanning is good enough

1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:34.440
 for the critical things in terms of memories,

1:30:34.440 --> 1:30:36.440
 in terms of the particular quirks

1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:38.160
 of your cognitive processes.

1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:40.440
 They're not, they're not, yeah.

1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:44.640
 We're not close, yes, but we've made quite a bit of progress,

1:30:44.640 --> 1:30:49.640
 so it's, if you're an exponential type of person.

1:30:50.240 --> 1:30:52.120
 Yeah, well, let's dream a little here.

1:30:52.120 --> 1:30:54.600
 Yes, that's the point. The way it would work

1:30:54.600 --> 1:30:56.200
 that I could see it working is,

1:30:56.200 --> 1:31:00.880
 so you take a single cell slice through your dead brain,

1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:04.160
 and we can now, the problem with the engineering aspect

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:06.040
 is that the engineering is,

1:31:06.040 --> 1:31:09.240
 the physical aspect of the brain is not even half

1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:11.000
 the problem, the problem is which genes

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:13.000
 are switched on and off.

1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:15.160
 This experience that we're having here

1:31:15.160 --> 1:31:18.280
 is altering certain genes in neurons

1:31:18.280 --> 1:31:22.080
 that will be preserved hopefully for a number of decades,

1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:25.280
 but you cannot see that with a microscope easily,

1:31:25.280 --> 1:31:27.800
 but there are technologies invented,

1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:30.760
 actually just down the hall in the building I'm at,

1:31:30.760 --> 1:31:32.000
 George Church invented a way,

1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:34.560
 his lab invented a way to look at

1:31:34.560 --> 1:31:36.840
 which genes are switched on and off,

1:31:36.840 --> 1:31:38.040
 not only in a single cell,

1:31:38.040 --> 1:31:40.080
 which any lab can do these days,

1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:43.000
 but in situ, where it's situated in the brain.

1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:45.240
 So you can say, okay, this nerve cell

1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:47.680
 had these genes switched on and these switched off,

1:31:47.680 --> 1:31:49.720
 we can recreate that,

1:31:49.720 --> 1:31:50.960
 but just scanning the brain

1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:52.560
 and looking how the nerves are touching each other

1:31:52.560 --> 1:31:53.400
 is not gonna do it.

1:31:54.840 --> 1:31:55.920
 Wow, okay.

1:31:55.920 --> 1:31:58.120
 So you have to scan the full biology,

1:31:58.120 --> 1:31:59.280
 the full details.

1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:00.440
 And look at the epigenome.

1:32:00.440 --> 1:32:01.560
 And the epigenome too.

1:32:01.560 --> 1:32:03.120
 Yeah, which genes are on and off?

1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:05.080
 It's just easier to reset the epigenome

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:06.520
 and get them to work like they used to.

1:32:06.520 --> 1:32:07.360
 Yeah, true, true.

1:32:07.360 --> 1:32:08.360
 We're doing that now.

1:32:08.360 --> 1:32:09.760
 Use the hardware we already have,

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:13.840
 just figure out how to make that hardware last longer.

1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:15.720
 Right, ultimately information will be lost,

1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:19.400
 even genetic information degrades slowly through mutation.

1:32:19.400 --> 1:32:22.520
 So we, immortality is not achievable through that means,

1:32:22.520 --> 1:32:25.280
 though I think we could potentially reset the body

1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:28.480
 hundreds of times and live for thousands of years.

1:32:28.480 --> 1:32:31.560
 Okay, so we talked about biology.

1:32:31.560 --> 1:32:32.960
 Let's forgive me,

1:32:32.960 --> 1:32:36.720
 but let's talk about philosophy for just a brief moment.

1:32:36.720 --> 1:32:38.720
 So somebody I've enjoyed reading,

1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:40.680
 Ernest Becker wrote the Denial of Death.

1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:42.960
 There's also Martin Heidegger.

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:47.800
 There's a bunch of philosophers who claim

1:32:47.800 --> 1:32:51.960
 that most people live life in denial of death.

1:32:51.960 --> 1:32:56.960
 Sort of, we don't fully internalize

1:32:58.360 --> 1:33:00.080
 the idea that we're going to die.

1:33:04.200 --> 1:33:06.960
 Because if we did, as they say,

1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:10.200
 there will be a kind of terror of,

1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:14.080
 I mean, a deep fear of death.

1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:17.240
 The fact that we don't know what's,

1:33:17.240 --> 1:33:22.240
 like we almost don't know what to do with non existence

1:33:23.240 --> 1:33:28.240
 with disappearing, like the way we draw meaning from life

1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:30.840
 seems to be grounded in the fact that we exist

1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:34.600
 and that we some point will not exist is terrifying.

1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:37.600
 And so we live in an illusion that we're not going to die

1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:39.640
 and we run from that terror.

1:33:39.640 --> 1:33:41.680
 That's what Ernest Becker would say.

1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:44.200
 Do you think there's any truth to that?

1:33:44.200 --> 1:33:45.400
 Oh, I know there's truth to that.

1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:47.800
 I experience it every day when I talk to people.

1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:51.360
 We have to live that way, although unfortunately I can't,

1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:56.360
 but for most people it's extremely distressing

1:33:56.520 --> 1:33:59.360
 to think about their own mortality.

1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:00.560
 We think about it occasionally.

1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:02.280
 And if we really thought about it every day,

1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:03.960
 we'd probably be brought to tears.

1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:05.760
 How much we not just miss ourselves,

1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:07.520
 but miss our family, our friends.

1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:11.760
 We are of all living life forms have evolved

1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:14.400
 to not want to die.

1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:15.640
 And what I mean want,

1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:18.200
 biochemically, genetically, physically,

1:34:18.200 --> 1:34:21.640
 that yeast cell, the cells that I studied at MIT,

1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:23.680
 they were fighting for their lives.

1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:25.240
 They didn't think,

1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:28.920
 but our brain has evolved the same survival aspect.

1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:30.320
 Of course, we don't want to die,

1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:32.480
 but the problem for us unfortunately,

1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:34.920
 it's a curse and a blessing is the way now conscious.

1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:37.120
 We know that we're going to die.

1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:40.280
 Most species that have ever existed don't.

1:34:40.280 --> 1:34:42.280
 That's a burden, that's a curse.

1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:43.640
 And so what I think's happened is

1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:46.840
 we've evolved certainly to want to live for a long time,

1:34:46.840 --> 1:34:49.120
 perhaps never want to die.

1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:52.120
 But the thought about dying is so traumatic

1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:55.560
 that there isn't an innate part of our brains.

1:34:55.560 --> 1:34:59.200
 And it's probably genetically wired to not think about it.

1:35:00.920 --> 1:35:03.160
 I really think that's part of being human.

1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:05.240
 Because, you know, think about tribes

1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:07.800
 that obsessed with longevity every day

1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:09.560
 and that we're going to die.

1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:12.280
 They probably didn't make much technological progress

1:35:12.280 --> 1:35:14.600
 because they were just crying in their huts every day

1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:16.280
 or, you know, in the savannah.

1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:20.360
 I really think that we've evolved to naturally deny aging.

1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:23.240
 And it's one of the problems that I face in my career.

1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:26.840
 And, you know, when I speak publicly and on social media,

1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:28.400
 is that it's shocking.

1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:29.960
 People don't want to think about their age,

1:35:29.960 --> 1:35:31.760
 but I think it's getting better.

1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:33.960
 I think my book has helped.

1:35:33.960 --> 1:35:36.320
 These tests that we're developing should help people

1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:38.400
 understand it's not a problem

1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:40.360
 to think about your longterm health.

1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:42.760
 In fact, if you don't, you're going to reach 80

1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:43.880
 and really regret it.

1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:47.800
 And the other side of it, so again, Ernest Becker,

1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:50.680
 but also Victor Franco, I recommend a highly manned search

1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:54.920
 for meaning, Bernard Williams is a moral philosopher.

1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:58.640
 They kind of argue that this knowledge of death,

1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:03.640
 even if we often don't contemplate it, we do at times.

1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:07.000
 And the very, what you call the curse,

1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:10.680
 which I agree with you, it's a curse and a blessing

1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:13.920
 that we're able to contemplate our own mortality.

1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:16.600
 That gives meaning to life.

1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:18.880
 So death gives meaning to life.

1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:21.200
 As what Victor Franco's argues,

1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:22.640
 I would probably argue the same.

1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:25.240
 There's something about the scarcity of life

1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:30.240
 and contemplating that makes each moment that much sweeter.

1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:32.400
 Is there something to that?

1:36:32.400 --> 1:36:33.880
 I think it's individual.

1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:36.040
 In my case, it's completely wrong.

1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:39.840
 I appreciate you saying that.

1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:41.840
 I don't get joy out of every day

1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:43.760
 because I think I'm going to die.

1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:46.040
 I get joy out of every day because every day is joyous

1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:47.440
 and I make it that way.

1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:50.440
 And even if I thought I was going to live forever,

1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:53.120
 I would still be enjoying this moment just as much.

1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:56.320
 And I bet you would too.

1:36:56.320 --> 1:36:59.880
 Well, that's, I think about that a lot.

1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:03.560
 I think it's very difficult to know.

1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:06.720
 I'm almost afraid that I wouldn't enjoy it as much

1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:07.960
 if I was immortal.

1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:10.000
 I'm almost afraid to want to be immortal

1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:15.000
 or to live longer because it perhaps is a kind of justification

1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:21.680
 for me to accept that I'm going to die.

1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:23.480
 It's saying like, oh, if I was immortal,

1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:26.160
 I wouldn't be able to enjoy life as much as I do.

1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:29.240
 But it's very possible that I would enjoy just as much.

1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:34.240
 Of course, enjoying life, whether you're immortal or not,

1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:35.560
 takes work.

1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:39.880
 Like it requires you to have the right kind of frame of mind.

1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:42.480
 You can discover, you can focus your mind

1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:44.520
 on the ugliness of life.

1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:46.920
 There's plenty of ugly things in this world

1:37:46.920 --> 1:37:48.000
 and you can focus on them.

1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:49.360
 You can complain.

1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:53.520
 Whenever, like, you know, if it's raining outside,

1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:56.760
 you can focus on the fact that you have shelter

1:37:56.760 --> 1:37:58.520
 and enjoy the hell out of it

1:37:58.520 --> 1:38:02.080
 or you can enjoy running in the rain when it's warm

1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:05.760
 and the beauty of nature just being one with nature

1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:09.040
 or you can just complain this fucking weather again in Boston

1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:11.240
 and then it's either always raining or freezing,

1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:16.240
 damn it, and the same thing with Wi Fi going out

1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:18.400
 on airplanes.

1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:23.400
 You can either complain about stupid Wi Fi

1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:25.880
 on JetBlue or something,

1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:27.680
 or you could say like, how incredible it is

1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:29.200
 that I can fly through the sky

1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:31.800
 and in a matter of hours be anywhere else in the world.

1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:33.440
 And then it could also on occasion,

1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:36.840
 watch, like, check email and even watch movies

1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:39.600
 through this, while connecting through satellites

1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:40.520
 that are flying through space.

1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:41.920
 So it's a matter of perspective

1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:45.000
 and perhaps there's an extra level of work required

1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.640
 when you're immortal because it's easier

1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:51.720
 when you're immortal or live longer to be lazy,

1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:53.040
 to delay stuff.

1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:55.480
 But if you're not, you can still derive the same amount

1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:56.320
 of joy.

1:38:56.320 --> 1:38:59.040
 It's possible, it's possible.

1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:00.560
 It's definitely possible in my life.

1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:03.040
 I went from being the nothing's working

1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:06.560
 to everyday's great to wake up to.

1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:08.880
 And I think even if you live,

1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:10.360
 think you're gonna live forever,

1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:12.080
 you can enjoy every day.

1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:14.840
 What I do is everything's relative.

1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:16.560
 We can compare ourselves to our neighbor

1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:18.800
 who has more money or to the flight

1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:20.400
 that should have had Wi Fi,

1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:23.520
 or which is what I do, I'm still six years old, remember?

1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:26.960
 What a six year old does, says, look,

1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:29.880
 I can, when I tell my fingers to form a fist,

1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:31.240
 they actually do that.

1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:32.640
 That's really cool.

1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:34.720
 That's how I live my life.

1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:36.800
 I can pick up on your desk here, this metal object.

1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:39.800
 It's a metal cube, about an inch by an inch by an inch.

1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:42.520
 And I tell myself, not about cubes,

1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:44.880
 but about inanimate objects.

1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:48.240
 Probably once a day I'll say, I am a living thing.

1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:49.880
 I can think, I can move, I can eat.

1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:51.840
 I am full of energy.

1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:53.880
 And there's that leaf or this cube here

1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:55.800
 that will never be alive.

1:39:55.800 --> 1:39:59.160
 That's what I look at and compare myself to.

1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:01.080
 And for as long as I live, if it's forever,

1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:04.000
 of course it won't be, but even if it was forever,

1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.800
 the relative to this lump of metal on this table here,

1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:10.840
 we are wondrous things in the universe.

1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:13.760
 And probably the most wondrous things in the universe.

1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:18.680
 Yeah, we're able to deeply appreciate the leaf or the cube

1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:20.560
 and deeply appreciate ourselves,

1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:24.400
 which is, it can be a curse, but it's mostly a gift.

1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:28.160
 Especially when you're, it's such a beautiful poem.

1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:31.680
 Now I'm six, I'm as clever as clever.

1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:35.400
 So I think I'll be six now forever and ever.

1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:37.880
 That's a good thing to aspire to.

1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:40.640
 Your grandmother was onto something.

1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:43.040
 David, this was an incredible conversation.

1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:44.640
 I'm a huge fan of your work.

1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:49.360
 So thank you for wasting your valuable time with me today.

1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:50.520
 I really, really appreciate it.

1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:51.360
 This was awesome.

1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:54.000
 Thank you for having me on Lex, appreciate it.

1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:55.520
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:40:55.520 --> 1:40:57.880
 with David Sinclair, and thank you too.

1:40:57.880 --> 1:41:01.280
 On It, Clear, National Instruments,

1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:03.640
 Simply Safe, and Linode.

1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:05.080
 Check them out in the description

1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:07.160
 to support this podcast.

1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:08.720
 And now let me leave you some words

1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:10.600
 from Arthur Schopenhauer.

1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:13.680
 All truth passes through three stages.

1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:15.480
 First, it is ridiculed.

1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:18.240
 Second, it is violently opposed.

1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:22.280
 Third, it is accepted as being self evident.

1:41:22.280 --> 1:41:49.840
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
