00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
 The following is a conversation with Ian Hutchinson, a nuclear engineer and plasma

00:04.160 --> 00:09.280
 physicist at MIT. He has made a number of important contributions in plasma physics,

00:09.280 --> 00:14.800
 including the magnetic confinement of plasmas seeking to enable fusion reactions,

00:14.800 --> 00:20.480
 which happens to be the energy source of the stars, to be used for practical energy production.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.960
 Current nuclear reactors, by the way, are based on fission as we discuss.

00:24.960 --> 00:31.120
 Ian has also written on the philosophy of science and the relationship between science

00:31.120 --> 00:36.560
 and religion, arguing in particular against scientism, which is a negative description

00:36.560 --> 00:40.880
 of the overreach of the scientific method to questions not amenable to it.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.960
 On this latter topic, I recommend two of his books, his new one,

00:44.960 --> 00:49.440
 Can A Scientist Believe in Miracles, where he answers more than 200 questions on all aspects

00:49.440 --> 00:55.360
 of God and science and his earlier book on scientism called Monopolizing Knowledge.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.240
 As you may have seen already, I work hard on having an open mind, always questioning my assumptions,

01:02.240 --> 01:07.280
 and in general, marvel at the immense mystery of everything around us and the limitations

01:07.280 --> 01:14.480
 of at least my mind. I'm not religious myself in that I don't go to a synagogue, a church,

01:14.480 --> 01:20.560
 or mosque, but I see the beautiful bond in the community that religion at its best can create.

01:21.360 --> 01:28.640
 I also see both in scientists and religious leaders signs of arrogance, hypocrisy,

01:28.640 --> 01:35.840
 greed, and a will to power. We're human. By the Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim,

01:36.400 --> 01:42.560
 agnostic, or atheist, this podcast is my humble attempt to explore a complicated human nature.

01:42.560 --> 01:49.200
 What Stanislav Lem in his book Solaris called Our Own Labyrinth of Dark Passages and Secret

01:49.200 --> 01:56.080
 Chambers. I ask that you try to keep an open mind as well and be patient with the limitations of

01:56.080 --> 02:04.400
 mind. Quick summary of the ads, two new amazing sponsors, Sunbasket and PowerDot. Please consider

 It's an e stem electrical stimulation device that I've been using a lot for muscle recovery

04:31.520 --> 04:37.200
 recently, mostly for my shoulders and legs as I've been doing the 1000 body weight reps and

04:37.200 --> 04:44.080
 six miles every day. As I just finished, they call it the smart muscle stimulator,

05:32.000 --> 05:37.680
 Maybe it'd be nice to draw a distinction between nuclear physics and plasma physics. What is the

05:37.680 --> 05:43.200
 distinction? Nuclear physics is about the physics of the nucleus and my department,

05:43.200 --> 05:48.400
 department of nuclear science and engineering at MIT, is very concerned about all the interactions

05:48.400 --> 05:55.520
 and reactions and consequences of things that go on in the nucleus, including nuclear energy,

05:56.240 --> 06:01.840
 fission energy, which is the nuclear energy that we have already, and fusion energy, which is the

06:01.840 --> 06:07.520
 energy source of the sun and stars, which we don't quite know how to turn into practical energy

06:09.360 --> 06:16.000
 for humankind at the moment. That's what my research has mostly been aimed at.

06:16.000 --> 06:25.200
 But plasmas are essentially the fourth state of matter. So if you think about solid, liquid,

06:25.200 --> 06:31.840
 gas, plasma is the fourth of those states of matter. And it's actually the state of matter

06:31.840 --> 06:41.840
 which one reaches if one raises the temperature. So cold things like ice are solid, liquids are

06:41.840 --> 06:49.040
 hotter water. And if you heat water beyond 100 degrees Celsius, it becomes gas. Well,

06:49.040 --> 06:58.400
 that's true of most substances. And plasma is a state of matter in which the electrons are

06:59.120 --> 07:04.560
 unbound from the nuclei. So they become separate from the nuclei and can move

07:04.560 --> 07:12.400
 separately. So we have positively charged nuclei. And we have negatively charged electrons. The

07:12.400 --> 07:22.800
 net is still electrically neutral. But a plasma conducts electricity, has all sorts of important

07:22.800 --> 07:29.600
 properties that are associated with that separation. And that's what plasmas are all about. And the

07:29.600 --> 07:35.200
 reason why my department is interested in plasma physics very strongly is because most things,

07:35.200 --> 07:39.600
 well, for one thing, most things in the universe are plasma. The vast majority of matter in the

07:39.600 --> 07:48.720
 universe is plasma. But most particularly, stars and the sun are plasmas because they're very hot.

07:48.720 --> 07:55.200
 And it's only in very hot states that nuclear fusion reactions take place. And we want to

07:55.200 --> 08:02.400
 understand how to implement those kind of phenomena on Earth. Maybe another distinction we want to

08:02.400 --> 08:07.600
 try to get at is difference between fission and fusion. So you mentioned fusion is the kind of

08:07.600 --> 08:13.440
 reaction happening in the sun. So what's fission and what's fusion? Sure. Well, fission is taking

08:13.440 --> 08:20.720
 heavy elements like uranium and breaking them up. And it turns out that that process of breaking

08:20.720 --> 08:25.920
 up heavy elements releases energy. What does it mean to be a heavy element? It means that there

08:25.920 --> 08:35.120
 are many nuclear particles in the nucleus itself, neutrons and protons in the nucleus itself,

08:35.120 --> 08:44.240
 so that in the case of uranium, there are 92 protons in each nucleus. And even more neutrons,

08:44.240 --> 08:51.360
 so that the total number of nucleons in the nucleus, nucleons is short for either a proton

08:51.360 --> 09:01.520
 or a neutron, the total number might be 235, that's U235 or it might be 238, that's U238.

09:01.520 --> 09:06.320
 So those are heavy elements. Light elements, by contrast, have very few

09:06.320 --> 09:14.480
 nucleons, protons or neutrons in the nucleus. Hydrogen is the lightest nucleus. It has one proton.

09:14.480 --> 09:22.880
 They're actually slightly heavier forms of hydrogen, isotopes. Deuterium has a proton and a neutron,

09:22.880 --> 09:29.600
 and tritium has a proton and two neutrons, so it has total of three nucleons in the nucleus.

09:29.600 --> 09:38.000
 Well, taking light elements, like isotopes of hydrogen, and not breaking them up, but

09:38.000 --> 09:44.160
 actually fusing them together, reacting them together to produce heavier elements, typically

09:44.160 --> 09:52.720
 helium, which is helium is a nucleus which has two protons and two neutrons, that also releases

09:52.720 --> 10:00.400
 energy. And that, or reactions like that, making heavier elements from lighter elements, is what

10:01.360 --> 10:07.760
 mostly powers the sun and stars. Both fusion and fission release

10:08.960 --> 10:17.200
 approximately a million times more energy per unit mass than chemical reactions. So chemical reaction

10:17.200 --> 10:23.920
 means take hydrogen, take oxygen, react them together, let's say, and get water. That releases

10:23.920 --> 10:29.600
 energy. The energy released in a chemical reaction like that, or the burning of coal, or on oil,

10:29.600 --> 10:36.400
 or whatever else, is about a million times less per unit mass than what is released in nuclear

10:36.400 --> 10:44.720
 reactions. So, but it's hard to do. It requires very high energy of impact. And actually, it's

10:44.720 --> 10:50.800
 very easy to understand why. And that is that those two nuclei, if they're both, let's say,

10:50.800 --> 10:55.520
 hydrogen nuclei, one is, let's say, deuterium, and the other is, let's say, tritium, they're both

10:55.520 --> 11:01.600
 electrically charged. And so that, and they're positively charged, so they like charges repel.

11:01.600 --> 11:06.800
 Everyone knows that, right? So basically, to get them close enough together to react,

11:06.800 --> 11:14.720
 you have to overcome the repulsion, the electric repulsion of the two nuclei from one another.

11:14.720 --> 11:20.320
 And you have to get them extremely close to one another in order for the nuclear forces to overtake

11:20.320 --> 11:27.520
 the electrical forces and actually form a new nucleus. And so one requires very high energies

11:27.520 --> 11:33.360
 of impact in order for reactions to take place. And those high energies of impact correspond to

11:33.360 --> 11:39.920
 very high temperatures of random motion. So that's why you can do something like that in the sun.

11:39.920 --> 11:45.680
 So we can build the sun. That's one way to do it. But on Earth, how do you create a fusion

11:45.680 --> 11:58.080
 reaction? Well, nature's fusion reactors are indeed the stars. And they are very hot in the

11:58.080 --> 12:06.640
 heart in the center. And they reach the point where they release more energy from those reactions

12:06.640 --> 12:12.880
 than they lose by radiation and transport to the surface and so forth. And that's a state of

12:12.880 --> 12:20.480
 ignition. And that's what we have to achieve to give net energy. It's like lighting a fire.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.960
 If you have a bundle of sticks and you hold a match up to it,

12:24.960 --> 12:32.800
 and you see smoke coming from the sticks, but you take the match away and the sticks just fizzle out,

12:33.680 --> 12:38.320
 that's not, the reason they fizzle out is that, yes, they were burning, there was smoke coming

12:38.320 --> 12:44.240
 from them, but they were not ignited. But if you are able to take the match away and they keep

12:44.240 --> 12:49.360
 burning and they are generating enough heat to keep themselves hot and hence keep the reactions

12:49.360 --> 12:57.440
 going, that's chemical ignition. But what we need to do, what the stars do in order to generate

12:57.440 --> 13:06.560
 nuclear fusion energy, is they are ignited. They are generated enough energy to keep themselves

13:06.560 --> 13:13.520
 hot. And that's what we've got to do on Earth if we're going to make fusion work on Earth.

13:13.520 --> 13:23.520
 But it's much harder to do on Earth than it is in a star because we need temperatures of order,

13:23.520 --> 13:30.080
 tens of millions of degrees Celsius in order for the reactions to go fast enough

13:30.960 --> 13:40.080
 to generate enough electricity or enough energy to keep it going. And so if you've got something

13:40.080 --> 13:45.680
 that's tens of millions of degrees Celsius and you want to keep it all together and keep the

13:45.680 --> 13:50.480
 heat in long enough to have enough reactions taking place, you can't just put it in a bottle,

13:52.000 --> 14:02.720
 plastic or glass, it would be gone in milliseconds. So you have to have some nonmaterial mechanism of

14:02.720 --> 14:11.120
 confining the plasma. In the case of stars, that nonmaterial force is gravity. So gravity is what

14:11.120 --> 14:18.640
 holds the star together, it holds the plasma in long enough for it to react and sustain itself

14:19.200 --> 14:25.040
 by the fusion reactions. But on Earth, gravity is extremely weak. I mean, I don't mean to say we

14:25.040 --> 14:31.360
 don't fall, yes we fall. But the mutual gravitational attraction of small objects

14:31.360 --> 14:38.720
 is very weak compared with the electrical repulsion or any other force that you can think about

14:39.440 --> 14:46.480
 on Earth. And so we need a stronger force to keep the plasma together to confine it.

14:47.680 --> 14:55.280
 And the predominant attempt at making fusion work on Earth is to use magnetic fields

14:55.280 --> 15:01.520
 to confine the plasma. And that's what I've worked on for much, essentially most of my career,

15:01.520 --> 15:09.440
 is to understand how we can and how best we can confine these incredibly hot gases, plasmas,

15:10.000 --> 15:15.360
 using magnetic fields with the ultimate objective of releasing fusion energy on Earth

15:16.160 --> 15:21.360
 and generating electricity with it and powering our society with it.

15:21.360 --> 15:27.520
 A dumb question. So on top of the magnetic fields, do you also need the plastic water bottle

15:27.520 --> 15:32.640
 walls or is it purely magnetic fields? Well, actually what we do need walls,

15:34.480 --> 15:37.840
 those walls must be kept away from the plasma because otherwise they'd be melted. Well,

15:37.840 --> 15:44.080
 the plasma must be kept away from them inside of them. But the main purpose of the walls

15:44.080 --> 15:51.440
 is not to keep the plasma in, it's to keep the atmosphere out. So if we want to do it on Earth

15:51.440 --> 15:58.080
 where there's air, we want the plasma to consist of hydrogen isotopes or other things, the things

15:58.080 --> 16:04.800
 we're trying to react. And by the way, the density of those plasmas, at least in magnetic

16:04.800 --> 16:11.600
 confinement fusion, is very low. It's maybe a million times less than the density of air in this room.

16:11.600 --> 16:19.600
 So in order for a fusion reactor like that to work, you have to keep all of the air out and just

16:19.600 --> 16:24.320
 keep the plasma in. So yes, there are other things, but those are things that are relatively easy. I

16:24.320 --> 16:30.240
 mean, making a vacuum these days is technologically quite straightforward. We know how to do that,

16:30.240 --> 16:38.640
 okay? What we don't quite know how to do is to make a confinement device that isolates the plasma

16:38.640 --> 16:43.680
 well enough so that it's able to keep itself burning with its own reaction.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.560
 So maybe can you talk about what a tachymarch is?

16:47.200 --> 16:53.840
 The Russian acronym from which the word tachymarch is built just means toroidal magnetic chamber.

16:53.840 --> 17:00.880
 So it's a toroidal chamber. A torus is a geometric shape which is like a doughnut with a hole down

17:00.880 --> 17:06.080
 the middle, okay? And so it's the meat of the doughnut, okay? That's the torus.

17:06.080 --> 17:14.880
 And it's got a magnetic field. So that's really all tachymarch means, but the particular configuration

17:16.480 --> 17:24.160
 that is very widespread and is the sort of best prospect in the least in the near term for making

17:24.160 --> 17:32.720
 fusion energy work is one in which there's a very strong magnetic field the long way around the

17:32.720 --> 17:39.440
 doughnut around the torus. So you've got to imagine that there's this doughnut shape with an embedded

17:39.440 --> 17:46.080
 magnetic field just going round and round the long way. The big advantage of that is that

17:47.680 --> 17:56.080
 plasma particles, when they're in the presence of a magnetic field, feel strong forces from the

17:56.080 --> 18:03.280
 magnetic field and those forces make the particles gyrate around the direction of the magnetic field

18:03.280 --> 18:12.240
 line. So basically the particles follow helical orbits like following like a spring that's directed

18:12.240 --> 18:17.520
 along the magnetic field. Well, if you make the magnetic field go inside this toroidal chamber

18:17.520 --> 18:25.760
 and just simply go round and round the chamber, then because of this helical orbit, the particles

18:25.760 --> 18:32.720
 can't move fast across the magnetic field, but they can move very quickly along the magnetic field.

18:33.600 --> 18:39.040
 And if you have a magnetic field that doesn't leave the chamber, it doesn't matter if they move

18:39.040 --> 18:44.720
 along the magnetic field. It doesn't mean they're going to exit the chamber. But if you just had

18:44.720 --> 18:54.400
 a straight magnetic field, for example, coming from a Helmholtz coil or a bar magnet, then you'd

18:54.400 --> 18:59.760
 have to have ends. It would come to the ends of the chamber somewhere and the particles would hit

18:59.760 --> 19:05.600
 the ends and they would lose their energy. So that's why it's toroidal and that's why we have a

19:05.600 --> 19:14.720
 strong magnetic field. It's providing a confinement against motion in the direction that would lead

19:14.720 --> 19:20.000
 the particles to leave the chamber. It turns out that, here we're getting a little bit technical,

19:20.000 --> 19:26.240
 but it turns out that a toroidal field alone is not enough. And so you need more fields to produce

19:26.240 --> 19:32.320
 true confinement of plasma and we get those by passing a current as well through the plasma

19:32.320 --> 19:37.120
 itself. Like to make sure it stays on track. Well, what that does is makes the field lines

19:37.120 --> 19:44.400
 themselves into much bigger helices. And for reasons that are too complicated to explain,

19:44.400 --> 19:51.120
 that clinches the confinement of the particles, at least in terms of their single particle orbits,

19:51.120 --> 19:55.360
 so they don't leave the chamber. So when the particles are flying along this

19:57.920 --> 20:03.840
 donut, the inside of the donut, where's the generation of the energy coming from?

20:03.840 --> 20:09.680
 Are they smashing into each other? Yeah, eventually, I mean, in a fusion reactor,

20:09.680 --> 20:14.720
 there will be deuterons and tritons and they will be smashing in, they will be very hot.

20:15.280 --> 20:20.640
 There'll be 100 million degrees Celsius or something. So they're moving thermally with

20:20.640 --> 20:26.160
 very large thermal energies in random directions, and they will collide with one another and have

20:26.160 --> 20:32.160
 fusion reactions. When those fusion reactions take place, energy is released, large amounts of

20:32.160 --> 20:37.360
 energy is released in the form of particles. One of the particles that's released is an alpha

20:37.360 --> 20:43.520
 particle, which is also charged and it's also confined. And that alpha particle stays in the

20:43.520 --> 20:48.800
 donut and heats the other particles that are in that donut. So it transfers its energy to those

20:48.800 --> 20:53.920
 and it keeps them hot. There's some leaking of heat all the time, a little bit of radiation,

20:53.920 --> 20:59.120
 some transport and so forth. There's also a neutron released from that reaction. The neutron

20:59.120 --> 21:04.560
 carries out four fifths of the fusion energy. And that will have to be captured in a blanket

21:04.560 --> 21:16.880
 that surrounds the chamber in which we take the energy, drive some kind of electrical generator

21:16.880 --> 21:25.120
 from thermal, thermal engine, gas turbine or something like that and power the power.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.640
 You got energy. So where do we stand? Where do we stand?

21:28.640 --> 21:35.440
 I'm getting this thing to be something that actually works to generate energy. Well,

21:36.000 --> 21:42.880
 there have been experiments that have generated net nuclear energies or nuclear powers in the

21:42.880 --> 21:52.960
 vicinity of a few tens of megawatts for a few seconds. So that's 10 megajoules. That's not

21:52.960 --> 22:06.240
 much energy. It's a few donuts worth of energy. Literal donuts. But we have studied how well

22:06.240 --> 22:14.160
 tachymex can confine plasmas. And so we now understand in rather great detail the way they

22:14.160 --> 22:21.120
 work. And we're able to predict what is going to be required in order to build a tachymex that

22:21.120 --> 22:26.720
 becomes self sustaining, that becomes essentially ignited or very so close to ignited that it

22:26.720 --> 22:37.120
 doesn't matter. And at the moment, at least if you use the modest magnetic field values,

22:37.120 --> 22:43.520
 still very strong but limited magnetic field values, you have to build a very big device.

22:43.520 --> 22:52.640
 And so we are at the moment at worldwide fusion research is at the moment in the process of

22:52.640 --> 22:59.520
 building a very big experiment that's located in the south of France. It's called ETA, ITER,

22:59.520 --> 23:04.880
 which means the way or just means the International Tachymex Experimental Reactor, if you like.

23:04.880 --> 23:14.320
 And that experiment is designed to reach this burning plasma state and to generate

23:14.320 --> 23:22.960
 about 500 megawatts of fusion power for hundreds of seconds at a time. It'll still only be an

23:22.960 --> 23:30.800
 experiment. It won't put electricity on the grid or anything like that. It's to figure out whether

23:30.800 --> 23:35.920
 it works and what the remaining engineering challenges are. It's a scientific experiment.

23:35.920 --> 23:41.360
 It won't be engineered to run round the clock and so on and so forth, which ultimately one

23:41.360 --> 23:46.560
 needs to do in order to make something that's practical for generating electricity. But it will

23:46.560 --> 23:55.680
 be the first demonstration on earth of a controlled fusion reaction for a long time period.

23:55.680 --> 24:01.680
 Is that exciting to you? It's been an objective that is in many ways

24:02.480 --> 24:07.280
 motivated my entire career and the career of many people like me in the field.

24:09.840 --> 24:15.680
 I have to admit though that one of the problems with ETA is that it's an extremely big and

24:15.680 --> 24:22.720
 expensive and long time to build experiment. And so it won't even come into operation

24:22.720 --> 24:31.200
 until about 2025, even though it's been being built for 10 years and it was designed for 30 years

24:31.200 --> 24:38.960
 before that. And so that's actually one of the big disappointments of my career in a certain sense,

24:39.520 --> 24:46.480
 which is that we won't get to a burning fusion reaction until well past the first operation

24:46.480 --> 24:51.920
 of ETA. And whether I'm alive or not, I don't know, but I certainly will be well included

24:51.920 --> 24:57.760
 retired by the time that happens. And so when I realized maybe some years ago that that was

24:57.760 --> 25:04.480
 going to be the case, it was a discouragement to me. Let's put it like that. But if we can try to

25:04.480 --> 25:11.680
 look maybe in a ridiculous kind of way, look into 100 years from now, 200 years, 500 years from now,

25:12.240 --> 25:17.920
 and we, you know, there's folks like Elon Musk trying to travel outside the solar system.

25:17.920 --> 25:23.280
 I mean, the amount of energy we need for some of the exciting things we want to do in this world,

25:23.280 --> 25:30.080
 if we look again 100 years from now, seems to be a very large amount. So do you think fusion

25:30.080 --> 25:39.760
 energy will eventually, sometime into your retirement, will be basically behind most of the

25:39.760 --> 25:47.440
 things we do? Look, I absolutely think that fusion research is completely justified. In fact,

25:47.440 --> 25:53.040
 we should be spending more time and effort on it than we currently do. But it isn't going to be

25:53.760 --> 26:00.880
 a magic bullet that somehow solves all the problems of energy. By the way, that's a generic

26:00.880 --> 26:06.080
 statement you could make about any energy source in my view. I think it's a grave mistake to think

26:06.080 --> 26:12.000
 that science of any sort is suddenly going to find a magic bullet for meeting all the energy needs

26:12.000 --> 26:17.280
 of society or any of the other needs of society, by the way. But and we can talk about that.

26:17.280 --> 26:27.440
 I hope later. But fusion is very worthwhile and we should be doing it. And so my disappointment

26:27.440 --> 26:34.400
 that I just expressed was in a certain sense a personal disappointment. I do think that fusion

26:34.400 --> 26:40.560
 energy is a terrific challenge. It's very difficult to bring the energy source of the sun and stars

26:40.560 --> 26:48.800
 down to earth. This does contrast, in a certain sense, with fusion energy. By contrast, fusion

26:48.800 --> 26:58.000
 energy, to build a fusion reactor proved to be amazingly easy. We did it within a few years of

26:58.000 --> 27:06.480
 discovering nuclear fusion. People had figured out how to build a reactor and did so during the

27:06.480 --> 27:11.200
 Second World War. Which is, by the way, fusion is how the current nuclear power plants work.

27:11.200 --> 27:20.320
 Yeah. And so we have nuclear energy today because fusion reactors are relatively easy to build.

27:20.320 --> 27:24.960
 You've got to have what's hard is getting the materials. And that's just as well,

27:24.960 --> 27:29.520
 because if everyone could get those materials, there would be weapons proliferation and so forth.

27:29.520 --> 27:37.040
 But it wasn't all that long after even the discovery of nuclear fusion

27:37.040 --> 27:42.000
 that fusion reactors were built. And fusion reactors, of course, operated before we had weapons.

27:42.000 --> 27:55.600
 So I think nuclear power is obviously important to meet the energy challenges of our age.

27:55.600 --> 28:05.120
 It is completely intrinsically, completely CO2 emissions free. And in fact, the wastes that come

28:05.120 --> 28:12.240
 from nuclear power, whether it's fission or fusion, for that matter, are so moderate in quantity

28:12.240 --> 28:19.680
 that we shouldn't really be worried about them. I mean, yes, fission products are highly radioactive

28:19.680 --> 28:24.400
 and we need to keep them away from people. But there's so little of them that keep

28:24.400 --> 28:30.800
 them away from people is not particularly difficult. And so while people complain a lot about the

28:30.800 --> 28:38.320
 drawbacks of fission energy, I think most of those complaints are ill informed. We can talk

28:38.320 --> 28:46.160
 about the challenges and the disasters, if you like, of fission reactors. But I think fission,

28:46.160 --> 28:54.960
 in the near term, offers a terrific opportunity for environmentally friendly energy, which in

28:54.960 --> 29:00.560
 the world as a whole is rapidly being taken advantage of. China and India and places like that

29:00.560 --> 29:06.400
 are rapidly building fission plants. We're not rapidly building fission plants in the US, although

29:06.400 --> 29:13.760
 we are actually building two at the moment, two new ones. But we do still get 20% of our

29:13.760 --> 29:20.080
 electricity from fission energy, and we could get a lot more. So it's clean energy. So it's clean

29:20.080 --> 29:27.120
 energy. Now, now again, the concern is that there's a very popular HBO show on just came out on

29:27.120 --> 29:32.400
 Chernobyl. There's the Three Mile Island, there's Fukushima, that's the most recent disaster. So

29:32.400 --> 29:39.280
 there's a kind of a concern of, yeah, I mean, nuclear disasters, is that, what would you make

29:39.280 --> 29:44.560
 of that kind of concern, especially if we look into the future of fission energy based reactors?

29:44.560 --> 29:48.480
 Well, first of all, let me say one or two words about the contrast between fission and fusion,

29:48.480 --> 29:51.520
 and then we'll come onto the question of the disasters and so forth.

29:52.720 --> 30:01.040
 Fission does have some drawbacks, and they're largely to do with four main areas. One is,

30:01.040 --> 30:07.760
 do we have enough uranium or other fissile fuels to supply our energy needs for a long time?

30:07.760 --> 30:15.440
 The answer to that is we know we have enough uranium to support fission energy worldwide

30:16.080 --> 30:25.600
 for thousands of years, but maybe not for millions of years, okay? So that's resources. Secondly,

30:26.640 --> 30:32.640
 there are issues to do with wastes. Fission wastes are highly radioactive, and some of them are

30:32.640 --> 30:42.880
 volatile. And so, for example, in Fukushima, the problem was that some fraction of the fission

30:42.880 --> 30:52.480
 wastes were volatilized and went out as a cloud and polluted areas with cesium 137,

30:52.480 --> 30:59.680
 strontium 90, and things like that. So that's a challenge of fission. There's a problem of safety

30:59.680 --> 31:09.600
 beyond that, and that is that in fission, it's hard to turn the reactor off. When you stop the

31:09.600 --> 31:16.400
 nuclear reactions, there is still a lot of heat being liberated from the fission products, and

31:16.400 --> 31:24.400
 that is actually what the problem was at Fukushima. The Fukushima reactors were shut down the moment

31:24.400 --> 31:31.360
 that the earthquake took place, and they were shut down safely. What then happened after that,

31:31.360 --> 31:40.080
 Fukushima, was there was this enormous tidal wave many tens of meters high that came through

31:40.080 --> 31:48.240
 and destroyed the electricity grid feed to the Fukushima reactors, and their cooling

31:48.240 --> 31:55.200
 was then turned off. And it was the after heat of the turned off reactors that eventually caused

31:55.200 --> 32:04.400
 the problems that led to release. And so that's a safety concern. And then finally, there's a

32:04.400 --> 32:11.200
 problem of proliferation, and that is that fission reactors need fissile fuel, and the technologies

32:11.200 --> 32:21.840
 for producing and enriching and so forth, the fuels, can be used by bad actors to generate

32:22.640 --> 32:27.920
 the materials needed for a nuclear weapon, and that's a very serious concern. So those are the

32:27.920 --> 32:35.120
 four problems. Fusion has major advantages in respect of all of those problems. It has more

32:35.120 --> 32:46.640
 longer term fuel resources. It has far more benign waste issues. The radioactivity from fusion

32:46.640 --> 32:52.800
 reactions is at least 100 times less than it is from fission reactions. It has no,

32:53.600 --> 32:58.000
 essentially none of this after heat problem, because it doesn't produce fission products that

32:58.000 --> 33:03.840
 are highly radioactive and generating their own heat when it's turned off. In fact, the hard part

33:03.840 --> 33:09.520
 of fusion is turning it on, not turning it off. And finally, you don't need the same

33:10.400 --> 33:17.120
 fission technology to make fusion work. And so it's got terrific advantages from the point

33:17.120 --> 33:25.520
 of view of proliferation control. So those are four main issues which make fusion seem attractive

33:25.520 --> 33:31.680
 technologically, because they address some of the problems of fission energy. I don't mean to

33:31.680 --> 33:37.120
 say that fission energy is overwhelmingly problematic, but clearly there have been

33:38.000 --> 33:44.880
 catastrophes associated with fission reactors. Fukushima actually is, I think in many ways,

33:44.880 --> 33:51.280
 often overstated as a disaster, because after all, nobody was killed by the reactors, essentially,

33:51.280 --> 34:01.920
 zero. And that's in the context of a disaster tsunami that killed between 15,000 and 20,000

34:01.920 --> 34:11.440
 people more or less instantaneously. So in the scale of risks, one should take the view that

34:12.800 --> 34:20.480
 in my estimation, that fission energy came out of that looking pretty good. Of course,

34:20.480 --> 34:26.720
 that's not the popular conception. I mean, with a lot of things that threaten our well being,

34:26.720 --> 34:35.840
 we seem to be very bad users of data. We seem to be very scared of shock attacks,

34:35.840 --> 34:41.360
 and not at all scared of car accidents, and this kind of miscalculation. And I think

34:41.360 --> 34:47.440
 from everything I understand, nuclear energy, fission based energy goes into that category.

34:47.440 --> 34:54.640
 It's one of the safest, one of the cleanest forms of energy, and yet whoever does the PR

34:54.640 --> 34:59.360
 for nuclear energy has a hard job ahead of them at the moment.

34:59.360 --> 35:03.520
 Well, I think part of that is their association with nuclear weapons. Because when you say the

35:03.520 --> 35:08.080
 word nuclear, people don't instantly think about nuclear energy, they think about nuclear weapons.

35:08.800 --> 35:15.280
 And so there is perhaps a natural tendency to do that. But yes, I agree with you,

35:15.280 --> 35:21.280
 people are very poor at estimating risks, and they react emotionally, not rationally in most of

35:21.280 --> 35:28.400
 these situations. Can we talk about nuclear weapons just for a little bit? So fission

35:29.120 --> 35:32.320
 is the kind of reaction that's central to the nuclear weapons we have today?

35:32.880 --> 35:37.920
 That's what sets them off. That's what sets them off. So if we look at the hydrogen bomb,

35:37.920 --> 35:40.960
 maybe you can say how these different weapons work.

35:40.960 --> 35:46.480
 So the earliest nuclear weapons, the nuclear bombs that were dropped on Japan, etc., etc.,

35:47.040 --> 35:53.520
 were pure fission weapons. They used enriched uranium or plutonium,

35:54.640 --> 36:03.360
 and their energy is essentially entirely derived from fission reactions. But it was early realized

36:03.360 --> 36:15.200
 that more energy was available if one could somehow combine a fission bomb with fusion reactions.

36:16.960 --> 36:25.760
 Because though fusion reactions give more energy per unit mass than fission reactions.

36:26.560 --> 36:31.200
 And this was called the super. You might have heard of the expression the super,

36:31.200 --> 36:37.920
 or more simply hydrogen bombs. Bombs which use isotopes of hydrogen and

36:37.920 --> 36:41.600
 the fusion reactions associated with them. Like you said, it's hard to turn on.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.200
 It's hard to turn on because you need very high temperatures and you need

36:45.840 --> 36:51.840
 confinement of that long enough for the reactions to take place. And so a bomb,

36:51.840 --> 37:02.560
 actually a thermonuclear bomb, or a hydrogen bomb, has essentially a chemical

37:03.280 --> 37:13.440
 implosion which then sets off a fission explosion, which then sets off and compresses

37:14.000 --> 37:19.760
 hydrogen isotopes and other things, which I don't know because I've never had a

37:19.760 --> 37:26.160
 security clearance. So I can't betray any secrets about weapons because I've never

37:26.160 --> 37:34.960
 been a party to them because I know a lot about this problem. I can guess and sets off fusion

37:34.960 --> 37:40.480
 reactions in the middle. So that's basically that sequence of things which produce these

37:40.480 --> 37:50.800
 enormous multi megaton bombs that have very large yields. And so fusion alone can't get

37:50.800 --> 37:59.920
 you there. It is actually possible to set off or to try to set off little fusion bombs alone

37:59.920 --> 38:07.760
 without the surrounding fission explosion. And that is what is called laser fusion.

38:07.760 --> 38:16.560
 So another approach to fusion, which actually is mostly researched in the weapons complex,

38:16.560 --> 38:23.200
 the national labs and so forth, because it's more associated with the technologies of weapons,

38:23.200 --> 38:30.320
 is inertial fusion. So if you decide instead of trying to make your plasma just sit there in

38:30.320 --> 38:36.080
 this torus in the tochimac and be controlled steady state with a magnetic field, if you're

38:36.080 --> 38:42.000
 willing to accept that, I'll just set off an explosion, okay, and then I'll gather the energy

38:42.000 --> 38:49.920
 from that somehow. I don't quite know how, but let's not ask that question too much. Then it is

38:49.920 --> 38:58.320
 possible to imagine generating fusion alone explosions. And the way you do it is you take

38:58.320 --> 39:05.600
 some small amount of deuterium tritium fuel, you bombard it with energy from all sides.

39:06.240 --> 39:11.920
 And this is what the lasers are used for extremely powerful at lasers, which compresses the

39:11.920 --> 39:18.720
 the pellet of fusion and heats it, it compresses it to such a high density and temperature that

39:18.720 --> 39:22.400
 the reactions take place very, very quickly. And in fact, they can take place so quickly that

39:22.400 --> 39:28.240
 they're all it's all over with before the thing flies apart. Wow. And that's what we're going to

39:28.240 --> 39:35.440
 do to heat it up really fast. That is inertial fusion. Okay. Is that useful for energy generation

39:35.440 --> 39:40.880
 for outside? Not yet. I mean, there are those people who think it will be, but you may have

39:40.880 --> 39:46.480
 heard of the big experiment called the National Ignition Facility, which was built at Livermore

39:46.480 --> 39:53.920
 starting in the late 1990s and has been in operation since around about 2010. It was

39:53.920 --> 40:00.160
 designed with the claim that it would reach ignition, fusion ignition, in this pulsed form

40:00.160 --> 40:05.760
 where the reactions are got over with so quickly before the whole thing flies apart. It didn't

40:05.760 --> 40:10.080
 actually reach ignition and it doesn't look as if it will, although, you know, we never know,

40:10.080 --> 40:17.200
 maybe people figure out how to make it work better. But the answer is, in principle, it seems

40:17.200 --> 40:22.880
 possible to reach ignition in this way, maybe not with that particular laser facility.

40:22.880 --> 40:30.880
 Are you surprised that we humans haven't destroyed ourselves given that we've invented

40:30.880 --> 40:37.920
 such powerful tools of destruction? Like, what do you make of the fact that for many decades

40:37.920 --> 40:43.200
 we've had nuclear weapons now? Speaking about estimating risk, at least to me, it's exceptionally

40:43.200 --> 40:52.640
 surprising. I was born in the Soviet Union that big egos of the big leaders when rubbing up against

40:52.640 --> 40:58.880
 each other have not created the kind of destruction everybody was afraid of for decades.

40:59.600 --> 41:04.240
 Well, I must say I'm extremely thankful that it hasn't. I don't know whether I'm surprised about

41:04.240 --> 41:10.960
 it. I've never thought about it from the point of view of, is it surprising that we've avoided it?

41:10.960 --> 41:15.520
 I'm just very thankful that we have. I think that there is a sense in which cooler heads

41:15.520 --> 41:24.000
 have prevailed at crucial moments. I think there is also a sense in which mutually assured destruction

41:25.280 --> 41:34.160
 has, in fact, worked as a policy to restrain the great powers from going to war. In fact,

41:34.160 --> 41:48.400
 the fact that we haven't had a world war since the 1940s is perhaps even attributable to nuclear

41:48.400 --> 41:59.280
 weapons in a kind of strange and peculiar way. But I think humans are deeply flawed and sinful

41:59.280 --> 42:05.680
 people. And I certainly don't feel that we're guaranteed that it's going to go on like this.

42:06.240 --> 42:12.960
 And we'll talk about the biggest picture view of it all. But let me just ask, in terms of your

42:12.960 --> 42:19.840
 worries of, if we look 100 years from now, we're in the middle of what is now a natural pandemic

42:19.840 --> 42:27.520
 that, from the looks of it, fortunately, is not as bad as it could possibly been.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.720
 If you look at the Spanish flu, if you look at the history of pandemics,

42:30.720 --> 42:35.360
 if you look at all the possible pandemics that could have been, that folks like Bill Gates

42:35.360 --> 42:43.120
 are exceptionally terrified about. I know many people are suffering, but it's better than it

42:43.120 --> 42:49.120
 could have been. So now we're talking about nuclear weapons. In terms of existential threats to us,

42:49.120 --> 42:59.600
 as sinful humans, what worries you the most? Is it nuclear weapons? Is it natural pandemics,

42:59.600 --> 43:05.680
 engineered pandemics, nanotechnology in my field of artificial intelligence? Some people

43:05.680 --> 43:12.880
 are afraid of killer robots. Robots, yeah. Do you think in those existential terms,

43:12.880 --> 43:22.400
 do any of those things worry you? I am certainly not confident that my children

43:22.400 --> 43:30.320
 and grandchildren will experience the benefits of civilization that I have enjoyed. I think it's

43:30.320 --> 43:38.240
 possible for our civilizations to break down catastrophically. I also think that it's possible

43:38.240 --> 43:47.920
 for our civilizations to break down progressively. And I think they will if we continue to have the

43:47.920 --> 43:56.480
 explosion of population on the planet that we currently have. I mean, it's quite wrong to think

43:56.480 --> 44:02.560
 of our problems as mostly being CO2. If we can just solve CO2, then we can go on having this

44:02.560 --> 44:08.160
 continually expanding economy everywhere in the world. Of course, you can't do that.

44:09.120 --> 44:14.000
 I mean, there is a finite bearing capacity of our planet.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.440
 On the resources of our planet.

44:15.440 --> 44:20.720
 On the resources of our planet. And we can't continue to do that. So I think there are lots

44:20.720 --> 44:30.800
 of technical reasons why a continually expanding economy and civilization is impossible.

44:30.800 --> 44:37.120
 And therefore, actually, I'm as much nervous about the fact that our population is 8 billion or

44:37.120 --> 44:45.520
 something right now worldwide as I am about the fact that a few million people would be killed

44:45.520 --> 44:51.760
 by COVID 19. I mean, I don't want to be callous about this, but from the big picture,

44:52.480 --> 45:00.000
 it seems like that's much more of a problem over population. People not dying is ultimately more

45:00.000 --> 45:07.920
 of a problem than people dying. So that probably sounds incredibly callous to your listeners,

45:07.920 --> 45:12.480
 but I think it's simply a sober assessment of the situation.

45:12.480 --> 45:19.840
 Is there ways from the way those 8 billion or 7 billion or whatever the number is live

45:20.720 --> 45:25.600
 that could make it sustainable? Because you've kind of implied there's a kind of,

45:25.600 --> 45:30.800
 we have, especially in the West, this kind of capitalist view of really consuming a lot of

45:30.800 --> 45:36.640
 resources. Is there a way to, like, if you could change one thing or a few things,

45:36.640 --> 45:43.200
 what would you change to make this life, make it more likely that your grandchildren

45:44.240 --> 45:45.840
 have a better life than you?

45:45.840 --> 45:51.200
 Well, okay. So let's talk a bit about energy because that's something I know a lot about,

45:51.200 --> 45:57.680
 having thought about it most of my career. In order to reach a steady state CO2 level,

45:57.680 --> 46:02.640
 okay, that's acceptable in terms of global climate change and so on and so forth,

46:03.760 --> 46:10.800
 we need to reduce our carbon emissions by at least a factor of 10 worldwide.

46:10.800 --> 46:19.920
 What's more, the average energy consumption and hence CO2 emission of people in the world

46:19.920 --> 46:28.240
 is less than a tenth of what we per capita of than what we have in the West, in America,

46:28.240 --> 46:34.160
 in Europe and so forth. So if you have in mind some utopia in the future where we've reached

46:34.160 --> 46:41.120
 a sustainable use of energy and we've also reached a situation in which there is far

46:41.120 --> 46:48.000
 less inequity in the world in the sense that people have shared the energy resources more

46:48.000 --> 46:54.880
 uniformly, then what that is equivalent to would be to reduce the CO2 emissions in Western economies,

46:54.880 --> 47:06.240
 not by a factor of 10, but by a factor of 100. In other words, has to go down to 1% of what it is

47:06.240 --> 47:15.840
 now, okay? So when people talk about let's use natural gas because maybe it only uses 60% of

47:15.840 --> 47:21.680
 the energy of coal, it's complete nonsense. That's not even scratching the surface of what we

47:21.680 --> 47:32.560
 would need to do. So is that going to be feasible? I very much doubt it and therefore I actually

47:32.560 --> 47:44.240
 doubt that we can reach a level of energy, of fossil energy use that is 1% of the current use

47:44.240 --> 47:52.160
 in the West without totally dramatic changes either in our society, our use of energy and so

47:52.160 --> 47:56.960
 forth, which actually of course as much of that energy is used for producing food and so on and

47:56.960 --> 48:02.880
 so forth. So it's actually not so obvious that we can cut down our energy usage by that factor,

48:02.880 --> 48:08.960
 or we've got to reduce the human population. Population. So you run up against that number,

48:08.960 --> 48:17.680
 that's increasing still. And you don't think that could be depressing. No, it's not depressing.

48:19.760 --> 48:28.560
 It's difficult, like many truths are. Do you have a hope that there could be a technological

48:28.560 --> 48:37.040
 solution? In short, no. There is no technological solution to, for example, for population control.

48:37.040 --> 48:42.720
 I mean, we have the technology just to prevent ourselves bearing children. That's not a problem.

48:42.720 --> 48:50.880
 Technology is in, solved. The challenge is society, the challenge is human choices,

48:50.880 --> 48:58.960
 the challenge is almost entirely human and sociological, not technology. And when people

48:58.960 --> 49:04.000
 talk about energy, they think that there's some kind of technological magic bullet for this,

49:04.000 --> 49:09.120
 but there isn't, okay? And there isn't for the reasons I just mentioned. Not because it's obvious

49:09.120 --> 49:16.880
 there isn't, but actually there isn't. And in any case, that it's true of energy, it's true of

49:16.880 --> 49:22.880
 pollution, it's true of human population, it's true of most of the big challenges in our society

49:22.880 --> 49:31.040
 are not scientific or technological challenges. They're human sociological challenges. And that's

49:31.040 --> 49:38.000
 why I think it's a terrible mistake, even for folks like me who work at, you know, well, the high

49:38.000 --> 49:45.600
 temple of science and technology in America and maybe in the galaxy. I mean, you know, it's...

49:45.600 --> 49:53.680
 MIT. It's at MIT. Best university in the world. It's a terrible mistake if we give the impression

49:53.680 --> 49:58.560
 that technology is going to solve it all. Technology will make tremendous contributions.

49:58.560 --> 50:05.200
 And I think it's worth working on it. But it's a disaster if you think it's going to solve all of

50:05.200 --> 50:11.520
 our problems. And actually, you know, I've written a whole book about the question of

50:11.520 --> 50:18.560
 scientism and the over emphasis on science, both as a way of solving problems through technology,

50:18.560 --> 50:22.800
 but also as a way of gaining knowledge. I think it's not all of the knowledge there is either.

50:22.800 --> 50:30.320
 Yeah. I think that book and your journey there is fascinating. So maybe you can go there. Can you

50:30.320 --> 50:37.360
 tell me about your... On a personal side, the personal journey of your faith, of Christianity

50:37.360 --> 50:41.920
 and your relationship with God, with religion in general?

50:42.800 --> 50:49.680
 Yeah. In my latest book, can a scientist believe in miracles? I give a first... I devote most of

50:49.680 --> 50:55.680
 the first chapter to telling how I became a Christian, why I became a Christian. I didn't

50:55.680 --> 50:59.680
 grow up as a Christian. Which is fascinating. I mean, you didn't grow up as a Christian,

50:59.680 --> 51:04.080
 so you've discovered the beauty of God and physics at the same time.

51:05.280 --> 51:08.640
 Concurrently. That's a very poetic way of putting it. But yes, I would accept that.

51:09.840 --> 51:12.880
 I became a Christian when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge University.

51:12.880 --> 51:20.400
 I had gone to a school in which there was religion, was part of the society. There were

51:20.400 --> 51:27.760
 prayers at the daily gathering of the students, the assembly of the students.

51:29.040 --> 51:33.120
 But I didn't really believe it. I just sort of went along with it and it wasn't particularly

51:34.080 --> 51:39.120
 aggressive or blind. It just sort of was there. But I didn't believe it.

51:39.120 --> 51:45.280
 That didn't make much sense to me. But I came across Christians from time to time.

51:45.280 --> 51:53.440
 And when I went to Cambridge University, two of my closest friends turned out were Christians.

51:53.440 --> 52:00.000
 And I think it was the most important influence on me that here were

52:01.440 --> 52:07.360
 two people who were really smart like me. I'm giving you my

52:07.360 --> 52:17.760
 impressions of it the way I felt at the time. And they thought Christianity made sense and

52:20.560 --> 52:26.000
 testified to its significance in their lives. So that was a very important influence on me.

52:28.000 --> 52:35.840
 And ultimately, I didn't see Christianity as some kind of great evil the way it's

52:35.840 --> 52:40.720
 sometimes portrayed by the radical atheists of this century. I mean, I think that's nonsense.

52:42.880 --> 52:46.800
 So I think there were certain attractive things. If you go to a university like Cambridge,

52:46.800 --> 52:54.880
 you're surrounded by Western culture from about the 15th century onwards.

52:54.880 --> 53:02.960
 And that's saturated with Christian art and architecture and so forth. And so it's hard

53:02.960 --> 53:09.760
 not to recognize that Christianity is, in fact, the foundation of Western society in Western

53:09.760 --> 53:18.320
 culture, Western civilization. So I mean, maybe I was in that sense favorably disposed towards

53:18.960 --> 53:23.760
 Christianity as a religion. But as a personal faith, it didn't mean anything to me. But I became

53:23.760 --> 53:31.200
 convinced really of two things. One is that the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ

53:31.200 --> 53:36.560
 is actually rather good. I mean, it's not a proof. It's not kind of some kind of scientific

53:36.560 --> 53:41.120
 demonstrate or mathematical demonstration, but it's actually extremely good. It's not

53:41.120 --> 53:44.720
 scientific evidence by and large. It's historical evidence. Historical evidence, yeah.

53:45.680 --> 53:50.560
 So that was one thing. And the other thing that came to me when I was at Cambridge,

53:51.120 --> 53:58.320
 it became clear that Christianity ultimately is not some kind of moral

53:58.320 --> 54:06.480
 theory or philosophy or something like that. It is, or at least it claims to be,

54:07.920 --> 54:15.520
 a personal relationship with God, which is made possible by what Jesus did on the cross and his

54:15.520 --> 54:23.360
 life and his teaching. And it's a personal call to a relationship with God. And that had, I'd

54:23.360 --> 54:28.720
 never really thought of it in those terms when I was younger. And that thought became

54:30.240 --> 54:34.240
 attractive to me. I mean, I think most people find the person of Christ

54:34.800 --> 54:38.800
 and his teachings compelling in a certain sense.

54:38.800 --> 54:42.880
 What do you mean by personal? Do you mean personal for you, like a relationship like

54:43.440 --> 54:51.760
 it's a meditative, like you specifically, you, Ian, have a connection with God. And then the

54:51.760 --> 54:58.480
 other side, you say personal with the actual body, the person of Jesus Christ. So all of those

54:58.480 --> 55:01.360
 things, what do you mean by personal connection and why that was me?

55:02.480 --> 55:12.080
 So as a Christian, I believe that I have a relationship with God, which is best expressed

55:12.080 --> 55:23.360
 by saying that it's personal. And that comes about because Jesus through his acts has reconciled me

55:23.360 --> 55:32.800
 with God, me a sinner, me someone full of sins, of failings, of ways in which I don't live up

55:32.800 --> 55:40.560
 to even my own ideals, let alone the ideals of a holy God, have been reconciled to the creator

55:40.560 --> 55:50.080
 of everything. And so Christians, myself included, believe that prayer is, in a certain sense, a

55:50.080 --> 55:57.920
 connection with God. And there are times when I felt that God spoke to me, I don't mean necessarily

55:57.920 --> 56:05.680
 orally in words, but showed me things or enlightened me or inspired me in ways that

56:05.680 --> 56:14.560
 I attribute to him. So I see it as a two way relationship in a certain sense. Of course,

56:14.560 --> 56:20.480
 it's a very asymmetrical relationship. But nevertheless, Christians think that it's a two

56:20.480 --> 56:26.720
 way, it's a two way street. We're not just talking into the air when we say, I'm going to pray for

56:26.720 --> 56:33.040
 someone. In this two way communication, is there a way for you that you could try to describe on

56:33.040 --> 56:48.240
 a podcast? What is God like in your view? If you try to describe, is it a force? Is it for you

56:48.240 --> 56:58.800
 intellectually, is it a set of metaphors that you use to reason about the world? Is it kind of a

56:58.800 --> 57:04.960
 computer that does some computation, that's the infinitely powerful computer? Or is it like Santa

57:04.960 --> 57:12.800
 Claus, a guy with a beard on the cloud? I don't mean what God actually is. I mean, in your limited

57:14.320 --> 57:21.280
 cognitive capacity as a human, what do you find helpful for thinking of what God actually looks

57:21.280 --> 57:28.640
 like? What is God? Well, let me start by saying none of the above, okay? Clearly God, the Christian

57:28.640 --> 57:38.720
 God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, etc., is not any of those things because all of those

57:38.720 --> 57:47.200
 things you just mentioned are phenomena or entities in the created world. And the most

57:47.200 --> 57:57.280
 fundamental thing about monotheism as Abraham and Moses and so forth handed it down is that God is

57:57.280 --> 58:03.760
 not an entity within the creation, within the universe, that God is the creator of it all.

58:04.320 --> 58:10.080
 And that's what Genesis, first two chapters of Genesis is really about. It's not about telling

58:10.080 --> 58:17.440
 us how God created the world, it's about telling us and telling the early Hebrews that God created

58:17.440 --> 58:23.280
 the world, okay? And that therefore he is not simply an entity within it. On the other hand,

58:23.280 --> 58:31.280
 our finite minds have a pretty hard time encompassing that. So one has to, therefore,

58:31.280 --> 58:39.920
 work in terms of metaphors and images and so forth. And I think we would know very little about

58:40.640 --> 58:49.760
 who God is if we were simply left to our own devices. If we were just, here you are,

58:49.760 --> 58:55.760
 you're in the universe, try to figure out who made it and so forth. Well, philosophers think

58:55.760 --> 59:00.240
 they can do a little bit of that, maybe, and theologians think that they can do a little bit

59:00.240 --> 59:08.880
 more. But Christians think that God has actually helped us along a lot by revealing himself.

59:10.000 --> 59:15.840
 And we say that he's revealed himself supremely in the person of Jesus Christ.

59:15.840 --> 59:22.320
 And so, you know, when Jesus says to his disciples, if you've seen me, you've seen the Father,

59:23.600 --> 59:28.640
 then that is in a certain sense a watchword for answering this question for Christians.

59:29.360 --> 59:35.600
 It is that supremely, if we want to help ourselves understand who God really is,

59:36.160 --> 59:44.800
 we look to Jesus, we look to what he did, we look to what he said, and so forth. And we believe

59:44.800 --> 59:51.440
 that he is one with the Father, and that's why we believe, you know, in the Trinity. I mean,

59:51.440 --> 59:58.480
 it's basically because that revelation is extremely central to Christian belief and teaching.

59:59.600 --> 1:00:07.280
 So, in that sense, through Jesus, that's kind of a historical moment that's profound,

1:00:07.280 --> 1:00:14.640
 that's really powerful. Do you also think that God makes himself seen in less obvious ways

1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:20.720
 in our world today? Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, it's certainly been

1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:32.160
 the outlook of Jews and Christians throughout history that God is seen in the creation. When

1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:40.960
 we look at the creation, we see to some extent the wonder, the majesty, the might of the person,

1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:50.000
 or the entity, but the person who created it. And that's a way in which scientists particularly

1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:59.040
 have, over the ages, and certainly over most of the last five centuries since the scientific

1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:05.920
 revolution, scientists have seen, in a certain sense, the hand of God in creation. I mean,

1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:13.600
 this leads us perhaps to a different discussion, but I mean, it's remarkable to me how influential

1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:21.360
 Christianity and religion in generally has been in science. Yeah, most of the scientists through

1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:27.120
 history, as you described, I mean, God has been a very big part of their life, and they've worked

1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:31.600
 certainly up until the beginning of the 20th century, that was the case.

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:35.600
 So maybe this is a good time to, can you tell me what scientism is?

1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:44.160
 Yeah, I mean, the short answer is that by scientism, we mean the belief that science is all the real

1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:50.480
 knowledge there is. That's a shorthand, there are lots of different facets of it, which one

1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:57.840
 can explore. And the book in which I explored it most thoroughly was actually an earlier book

1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:05.120
 called Monopolizing Knowledge. And the purpose of that title is to draw attention to the fact

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:14.800
 that in our society as a whole, particularly in the West today, we have grown so reliant on science

1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:24.160
 that we tend to put aside other ways of getting to know things. And so, of course, at MIT,

1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:32.160
 we are focused on science and we do focus on it very much. But the truth is that there are many

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:39.040
 ways of getting to know things in our world, know things reliably in our world, and a lot of them

1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:46.640
 are not science. So scientism, in my view, is a terrible intellectual era. It's the belief that

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:53.120
 somehow the methods of science as we've developed them with experiments and in the end, it relies

1:02:53.120 --> 1:03:00.320
 particularly upon reproducibility in the world and on a kind of clarity that comes from measurements

1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:09.840
 and mathematics and related types of skills. Those powerful, though they are for finding out

1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:18.160
 about the world, do not give us all the knowledge we have, and there's many other forms of knowledge.

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:25.920
 And the illustration that I usually use to try to help people to think about this is to say,

1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:30.800
 well, look, let's think about human history. I mean, to what extent can human history be

1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:36.480
 discovered scientifically? The answer is essentially it can't. And the reason is because human history

1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:42.400
 is not reproducible. You can't do reproducible experiments or observations and go back and

1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:53.120
 try it over again. It's a one off thing. History is full of unique events. And so you can't hope

1:03:53.120 --> 1:04:00.160
 to do history using the methods of science. Yeah. I mean, in some sense, history is a story of

1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:06.000
 miracles. I mean, they don't have to do with God. The uniqueness is anyway, unique events.

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:12.320
 It's unique events. And that science doesn't like that because it's unique events, but they're very

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:18.480
 definition are not reproducible. Can I ask sort of a tricky question? I don't even know what

1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:25.920
 atheist or atheism is, but is it possible for somebody to be an atheist and avoid

1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:34.240
 slipping into scientism? Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, these are two separate things. Okay.

1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:39.840
 I'm quite sure there are many people who don't believe in God and yet recognize that there are

1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:45.920
 many different ways of we get knowledge. You know, some is history, some is sociology, economics,

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:54.400
 politics, philosophy, art history, language, literature, et cetera, et cetera. There are

1:04:54.400 --> 1:05:00.320
 many people who recognize those disciplines as having their own approaches to epistemology and

1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:08.400
 to how we get knowledge and valuing them very highly. I don't mean to say that everyone who's

1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:16.240
 an atheist automatically subscribes to the scientific viewpoint. That's not true. But

1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:22.400
 it's certainly the case that many of the arguments, in fact, most of the arguments

1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:28.880
 of the aggressive atheists of this century, people are sometimes called new atheists, although

1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:35.040
 they're actually rather old, most of their arguments are rather old, are drawing heavily

1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:41.600
 on scientism. So when they say things like, there's no evidence to support Christianity.

1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:49.600
 What they are really focusing on is to say is saying that Christianity isn't proved or

1:05:50.320 --> 1:05:58.640
 the evidence for Christianity is not science. Science doesn't prove it. And if you read their

1:05:58.640 --> 1:06:05.120
 books, that's what you find they really mean is science doesn't lead you necessarily to believe

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:13.760
 in a creator God or into it in any particular religion. I accept that. That's not a problem to

1:06:13.760 --> 1:06:17.680
 me because I don't think that science is all the knowledge there is. And I think there are other

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:22.240
 important ways of getting to know things. And one of them is historical, for example, and I

1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:28.480
 mentioned earlier that I became persuaded and I still am persuaded that the historical evidence

1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:35.920
 for the resurrection is very persuasive. Again, it's not proof or anything like that, but it's

1:06:35.920 --> 1:06:45.040
 pretty good evidence. Okay. Yeah, I talked to Richard Dawkins on this podcast and I saw you

1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:52.080
 debate with Sean Carroll. So I understand this world, it makes me very curious. Maybe let me

1:06:52.080 --> 1:07:01.920
 ask sort of another way. My own kind of worldview, maybe you can help by way of therapy, understand.

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:09.920
 You know, because you've kind of said that there's other ways of knowing. What about if I kind of

1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:18.080
 sit here and am cognizant of the fact that I almost don't know anything? So I'm sitting here

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:23.680
 almost paralyzed by the mystery of it all. And it's not even, when you say there's other ways

1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:32.720
 of knowing, it feels almost too confident to me because, yeah, when I listen to beautiful music

1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:41.280
 or C.R., there's something there that's beyond the reach of scientism, I would say. So beyond the

1:07:41.280 --> 1:07:50.480
 reach of the tools of science. But I don't even feel like that could be an actual tool of knowing.

1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:57.360
 Yeah, I just don't even know where to begin because it just feels like we know so little.

1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:03.360
 Like if we look even 100 years from now, when people look back to this time, humans look back

1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:08.320
 to this time, they'll probably laugh at how little we knew, even 100 years from now. And if we look

1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:14.480
 at 1,000 years from now, hopefully we're still alive or AI versions of ourselves are still alive.

1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:25.760
 You know, they'll certainly laugh at the absurdity of our beliefs. So you don't seem to be as

1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:31.760
 paralyzed by how little we know. You confidently push on forward. But what do you make of that sense

1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:40.800
 of just not knowing of the mystery? First of all, we need to be modest or humble,

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:47.440
 if even, about what we know. I accept that. And I certainly think that's true. Not simply because

1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:54.640
 in the future, we'll know more science and there will be more powerful ways of finding out about

1:08:54.640 --> 1:09:01.760
 things. But simply because, you know, sometimes we're not right. We're wrong, okay, in what we

1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:12.240
 think we know. So that's crucial. But it's also a very Christian outlook. That kind of humility

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:18.240
 is what Jesus taught. So I don't know whether this was in the back of your mind when you were

1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:25.120
 thinking about this, but it's often the case that people of religious faith are accused of being

1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:32.640
 dogmatists. And there is a sense in which dogma teaching, accepted teaching, is part of religions.

1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:42.880
 But I don't think that necessarily that leads one to blind dogmatism. And I certainly don't

1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:48.480
 think that faith, we can talk about this later if you like, but I certainly don't think that faith

1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:54.160
 means thinking you know something and not listening to counter arguments, for example.

1:09:55.840 --> 1:09:57.760
 So I think that's crucial.

1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:04.800
 Yeah, what does faith mean to you? What does it feel like? What does it actually sort of,

1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:08.160
 how do you carry your faith in terms of the way you see the world?

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:14.400
 Well, I think faith is very often misunderstood in our society at the moment,

1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:25.280
 because it's often portrayed as being nothing other than believing things you know ain't true,

1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:39.280
 or believing things that are not proven. And faith does have a strand which is to do with

1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:49.120
 basically believing in concepts or propositions. But actually, the word faith is much broader

1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:59.280
 than that. Faith also means you know, trusting in something, trusting in a person, or trusting in

1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:06.560
 a thing, the reliability of some technology, for example. That's equally part of the meaning

1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:13.200
 of the word faith. And there's a third strand to the meaning of the word as well. And that is loyalty.

1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:19.760
 So, you know, I have faith in my wife, and I try to act in faith towards her,

1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:25.760
 and that's a kind of loyalty. And so those three strands are the most important strands

1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:32.160
 of the meaning of faith. Yes, belief in propositions that we might not have, you know,

1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:40.640
 full proof about, or maybe we have very little proof about, but it's also trust and loyalty.

1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:46.800
 And actually, in terms of the Christian faith, Christians are far more

1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:52.000
 called to trust and loyalty than they are to belief in things they don't, you know,

1:11:52.000 --> 1:12:00.400
 don't have proof of, okay? But the critics of religion generally tend to emphasize the first

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:05.120
 one and say, well, you know, you believe things for which you have no evidence, okay? That's what

1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:11.840
 they think faith is. Well, yeah, there is a sense in which everybody has to live their lives.

1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:24.400
 Believing or making decisions in situations when they don't have all the proof or evidence or

1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:32.160
 knowledge that enables you to make a completely rational or well informed or prudent decision.

1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:37.440
 You know, we do this all the time. You know, my drive down here, I nearly took a wrong turning

1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:44.560
 and I thought, which way do I go? Do I keep going straight on? And so my voice came out,

1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:54.000
 and I think, go straight, okay? So you have to make decisions, and sometimes, you know,

1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:58.160
 you don't have a navigation system telling you what to do, you just have to make that decision

1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:04.000
 with insufficient evidence, and you're doing it all the time as a human, and that's part of being

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:13.120
 sentient. And so that kind of action and belief on the basis of incomplete evidence is not something

1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:19.840
 that I feel uncomfortable doing or that I feel that somehow my Christian commitments have forced

1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:23.760
 me to do when I wouldn't have had to have done it otherwise. I would have had to do it anyway.

1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:29.840
 And so, you know, there's a sense in which I think it's important to see the breadth of

1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:34.880
 meaning of faith and to recognize that certainly in the case of Christianity,

1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:40.560
 it's trust and loyalty that the key themes that we're called to.

1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:47.120
 And I mean, another interesting extension of that that you speak to is kind of loyalty

1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:55.040
 is referring to a connection with something outside of yourself. So I think you've spoken about

1:13:55.040 --> 1:14:01.760
 like existentialism or even just atheism in general as leading naturally to an individualism,

1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:10.480
 as a focus on the self. And ideas that maybe the Christian faith can instill in you is

1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:16.400
 allowing you to sort of look outside of yourself. So connection, I mean, loyalty fundamentally is

1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:25.040
 about other beings and other beings. I mean, I think, I don't know what it is in me, but I'm

1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:32.160
 very much drawn to that idea. And I think humans in general are drawn to that idea. You can make

1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:37.040
 all kinds of evolutionary arguments, all that kind of stuff. But people always kind of tease me

1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:44.560
 because I talk about love a lot. And I mean, there's a lot of non scientific things about love,

1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:50.160
 right? Like what the heck is that thing? Why do we even need that thing? It seems to be an annoying

1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:55.920
 burden that we get so much joy in life from a connection with other human beings, deep

1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:02.480
 lasting connections with human beings. Same thing with loyalty. Why do we get so much value and

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:09.280
 pleasure and strength and meaning from loyalty, from a connection with somebody else, going through

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:14.000
 thick and thin with somebody else, going through some hard times? I mean, some of the closest

1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:21.440
 friends I have is going through some rough times together. And that seems to make life deeply

1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:31.760
 meaningful. What is that? So yeah, that resonates with me. And obviously, I would affirm it.

1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:40.080
 I think just to correct the implication that you made, I don't think it's necessarily

1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:49.280
 the consequence of atheism, that we lose track of those kinds of things. I mean,

1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:55.840
 I think that atheists can be loyal, okay, if you like. The question more often comes up in

1:15:55.840 --> 1:16:03.680
 the context of where does morality come from? And loyalty, I think, and duty are related

1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:08.720
 to one another. If we have loyalty to someone, then we have a duty to them, okay, as well.

1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:16.960
 And I think that insofar as we see ourselves as having any kinds of duties or moral compulsions

1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:23.840
 with respect to our relationships to other people, I think it's a question that always arises,

1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:30.000
 well, where do these come from? And there are various approaches that people have towards

1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:39.600
 deciding what makes ethics or morality moral, okay. But I do think it's the case that

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:51.360
 it's very hard to ground morality in any kind of absolute way or persuasive way

1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:59.120
 in mere human relationships. And so it's certainly the case that in Christianity,

1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:12.160
 there is a sense in which morality and the morality of morals comes from a transcendent place,

1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:25.440
 from a transcendent deity, and that we ground the compelling force of morals on God

1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:34.160
 more than we do on individuals. Because after all, if you've got nothing but other people,

1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:42.160
 why should you treat your neighbor well? Why shouldn't you defraud your neighbor if it's good

1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:48.160
 for you? Well, you can construct all kinds of arguments and some of them are obviously arguments

1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:53.120
 that are commonplace in religion too. You should do as you would be done by and all this kind of

1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:59.760
 thing. But none of that seems any more than mere pragmatism to most people, okay. And so that's

1:17:59.760 --> 1:18:06.800
 what that's one of the things that Nietzsche, amongst others, really identified. If God is dead,

1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:12.800
 if the idea of God is grounding our moral behavior is no longer viable in the West,

1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:19.200
 which Nietzsche thought that it wasn't, okay, then what does ground it? And he had no good answer for

1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:24.720
 it. In fact, he claimed there was no answer, but then he couldn't live with that. And so he

1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:32.560
 invented the idea of the ubermitsch, this superior human being, okay. And this was

1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:39.040
 a different way of trying to ground morality, not a very successful one. You could argue that

1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:46.960
 he's the forerunner of the sort of racism of Hitler's regime and so forth.

1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:56.000
 That we've, in the West, thankfully, shied away from in the past half or three quarters of a

1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:09.280
 century. But I think it is the case that Christianity gives me a basis for my moral beliefs that is

1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:17.200
 more than mere pragmatism. Yeah, but there is a, so stepping outside of all of that, there does seem

1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:24.480
 to be a powerful stabilizing, like we humans are able to hold ideas together, like in a distributed

1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:32.160
 way, outside of whether God exists or not, or that just our ability to kind of converge together

1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:39.680
 throws a set of beliefs into sometimes into tribes. It's kind of, I don't know if it's inherent to

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:46.960
 being human beings. I hope not, because now if I look on Twitter, and there's the red team and the

1:19:46.960 --> 1:19:53.600
 blue team, right? It's almost like it's a character, it's some kind of TV show that we're living in,

1:19:54.160 --> 1:19:58.560
 that people get into these tribes and they hold a set of beliefs that sometimes don't,

1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:05.680
 I mean, they are beliefs for the sake of holding those beliefs, and we get this intimate connection

1:20:05.680 --> 1:20:12.800
 between each other for sharing those beliefs. And we spoke to the things about loyalty and love,

1:20:12.800 --> 1:20:18.560
 and that's the thing that people feel inside the tribe. And it seems very human that within that

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:24.880
 tribe, those beliefs don't necessarily always have to be connected to anything. It's just the fact

1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:31.920
 that, you know, I've did sports my whole life. Whenever you're on a team, the bond you get with

1:20:31.920 --> 1:20:39.040
 other people on the team is incredible. And the actual sport is often the silliest. I mean,

1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:43.840
 I don't play ball sports anymore, but the ball when I play like soccer or tennis, I mean,

1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:49.360
 all those sports are silly, right? You're playing with a little ball, but there's the bond you get

1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:57.600
 is so deeply meaningful. It's interesting to me on a sociological level that it's possible to me

1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:07.040
 whatever the beliefs of religion is, whatever they're actually grounded in, they might have

1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:13.760
 a power in themselves. I think there is tribalism everywhere. And I think tribalism in the US at

1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:20.720
 the moment is rather difficult to bear from my point of view. And it's, I think, fed by the

1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:27.600
 internet and social media and so forth. But historically, tribalism has been a trait and

1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:35.360
 remains a trait in humans. The genius of Christianity is that it supersedes tribalism.

1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:46.080
 I mean, yes, when the Hebrews thought about Yahweh, initially they thought about him as their

1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:56.640
 tribal deity, just like the tribal deities round about them. And yet from early on in

1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:06.720
 early on in Hebrew history, the crucial thing that Yahweh came to mean or I would say, revealed of

1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:14.480
 himself to them was that he wasn't just a tribal deity. He was the God that created the whole thing.

1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:21.680
 And if he is the God of the whole thing, then he's not just the God of the Hebrews or in the case of,

1:22:21.680 --> 1:22:27.840
 you know, Americans, God is not just the God of Americans, he's the God of everybody.

1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:40.640
 And that is in a way the most amazing transcending of tribal loyalties. And one of the crucial

1:22:42.160 --> 1:22:47.440
 occasions in the New Testament, when the Holy Spirit comes at Pentecost,

1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:54.720
 you know, the apostles and the disciples speak in other tongues and there are people

1:22:54.720 --> 1:23:00.480
 from all the countries round about hear them in their own languages. And so,

1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:09.200
 whether you take that as factual or not, that is a statement of the transcendent

1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:16.000
 aspects of Christianity, the claimed transcendent aspects of Christianity, that it transcends

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:19.520
 culture. And that's certainly something which I find appealing.

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:29.520
 When I kind of touch on this topic in my own mind, one of the hardest questions is why is

1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:32.640
 there suffering in the world? Do you have a good answer?

1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:40.240
 Well, I have some answers, but you're right that it is one of the toughest questions. The problem

1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:47.440
 of pain or the problem of suffering or the problem of theodicy, as theologians call it,

1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:55.200
 is probably one of the toughest. I think it's important to say that there are certain types

1:23:55.200 --> 1:24:00.000
 of answers to this question, but there are aspects of this question to which there is no

1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:07.680
 intellectual answer that is going to satisfy. And the fact of the matter is, you know,

1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:17.200
 when I'm speaking to an audience, let's say, at some kind of lecture, I can be sure that there

1:24:17.200 --> 1:24:22.720
 are people in that audience who are either personally suffering, they've got illness,

1:24:22.720 --> 1:24:27.760
 they've got pains, maybe they're facing death, or someone in their family is in a similar

1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:35.120
 sort of situation. So, suffering is a reality. And there is nothing that I can say that is

1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:44.800
 going to solve their feeling of agony and angst and maybe despair in those types of situations.

1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:51.360
 There is really only one thing that I think humans can do for one another in those kinds of

1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:57.680
 situations. And that is simply to be there, to be there alongside your friend or your

1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:06.720
 colleague or family member or whoever it might be. And that's the only really sense in which

1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:12.800
 we can give comfort. If we try to give intellectual solutions to these problems,

1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:18.880
 we're going to be like the comforters that were in the book of Job in the Bible,

1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:28.240
 who brought no comfort to Job himself with their intellectual answers. But if they had

1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:33.680
 been there and some of them were there, they sat alongside, that is some level of comfort.

1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:41.280
 And after all, that's the meaning of the word compassion. It means to suffer alongside of

1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:49.440
 somebody. And I would say, first off, what does a Christian say about suffering? The first thing

1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:55.680
 a Christian should say is compassion is all that really counts. And what's more, we say

1:25:56.640 --> 1:26:03.920
 that God has acted in compassion towards us. That is to say, he has suffered with us

1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:08.640
 in the person of Jesus Christ. And when we see the passion of Jesus,

1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:16.320
 we recognize that God takes suffering deadly seriously, has taken it so seriously

1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:22.720
 that he's been willing to come and be a part of his creation in the person of Jesus Christ

1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:31.760
 and suffer death, the most horrible death on the cross for our benefit. So that's one side of suffering.

1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:43.040
 But the philosophical question remains, surely if God is good and God is omnipotent, benevolent,

1:26:44.480 --> 1:26:50.560
 why doesn't he take away all the suffering? Why doesn't he cause miracles to occur that

1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:55.120
 will take away all the suffering? I think there are some good answers to that question

1:26:55.120 --> 1:27:07.040
 in the in the following sense that we live in a world where the consistency of the world is an

1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:15.360
 absolutely crucial part of it. The fact that our world behaves reproducibly in the main

1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:23.040
 is absolutely essential for the integrity of our lives. Without it, we wouldn't exist.

1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:31.200
 And so there is a sense in which the integrity of creation calls for there being consistent

1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:38.800
 behavior, which these days we think of as being the laws of nature. And so the consistent behavior

1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:46.960
 of nature is very, very important and what enables us to be what we are. And if you're calling upon

1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:54.000
 God in your critique of why isn't this benevolent creator fixing things,

1:27:55.280 --> 1:28:02.480
 one answer is he's fixed things in a certain sense to have an integrity in them.

1:28:04.080 --> 1:28:10.960
 And that integrity is the best thing. It's the way we have our existence. It's the way we live

1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:17.360
 and move and have our being. And if you want something different, you've got to show that

1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:23.760
 there is a way in which you could invent a world that is better, that it has the integrity that

1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:33.360
 we need to exist and to be able to think and love and be, but you are going to do it better.

1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:39.360
 And the atheists think that maybe they have got a better idea, but if they thought about it a bit

1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:45.520
 more carefully, they'd realize no one has put forward a better idea. Okay. So another way to

1:28:45.520 --> 1:29:03.360
 say that is that suffering is an integral part of a consistent existence. In a philosophical sense,

1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:10.640
 the full richness and the beauty of our experience would not be as beautiful, would not be as rich

1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:15.760
 if there was no suffering in the world. Is that possible?

1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:21.920
 Well, I think you said two different things that aren't exactly the same. One is that suffering is

1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:30.080
 an integral part of our experience. That might be considered a challenge to certain types of

1:29:30.080 --> 1:29:36.720
 Christian theology or even Jewish theology. In other words, Christians talk about the fall and

1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:45.200
 talk about Adam and Eve in the garden and have a vision of there being some kind of perception

1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:50.960
 from or perfection from which we have fallen. And I think there is a perfection from which we've

1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:57.280
 fallen, but I don't think that perfection is some kind of physical perfection. In other words,

1:29:57.280 --> 1:30:03.200
 I don't subscribe personally to the view that some Christians do, that there was some state

1:30:04.640 --> 1:30:10.960
 prior to the fall in which death did not occur. I don't think that that's consistent with science

1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:20.640
 as we know it. And I think that death, for example, has been part of the biological world and the

1:30:20.640 --> 1:30:30.880
 universe as a whole from billions of years ago. So just to be clear about that, on the other hand,

1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:39.120
 so if that's the case, then certainly in that sense, at the very least suffering or at least death

1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:48.640
 is part of the biological existence. And that probably seems so completely obvious to somebody

1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:54.240
 who is au fait with science, whether they're a scientist or not.

1:30:55.360 --> 1:31:01.120
 And I apologize if I'm interrupting, but it's the obvious reality of our life today,

1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:06.240
 but there's a lot of people. I think it's currently in vogue. I've talked to quite a few folks who

1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:13.840
 kind of see as the goal of many of our pursuits as to extend life indefinitely, a sort of a

1:31:13.840 --> 1:31:20.800
 dream for many people is to live forever. But in the technological world, in the engineering world,

1:31:20.800 --> 1:31:28.240
 in the scientific world, I mean, that's the big dream. To me, it feels like that's not a dream.

1:31:29.360 --> 1:31:35.360
 I certainly would like to live forever. That's the initial feeling, the instinctual feeling,

1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:41.280
 because life is so amazing. But then if you actually kind of like you've presented it,

1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:47.760
 if you actually lived that kind of life, you would realize that that's actually a step backwards.

1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:53.040
 That's a step down from the experience of this life. In my sense, that death is an essential

1:31:53.040 --> 1:31:59.920
 part of life, about essential part of this experience, death of all things. So the fact

1:31:59.920 --> 1:32:09.120
 that things end somehow in a scarcity of things, somehow create the beauty of this experience

1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:15.680
 that we have. Yeah, transhumanism doesn't look very attractive to me either, but it also doesn't

1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:24.320
 look very feasible. But that's a whole big topic that I'm not exactly an expert, but I'll say,

1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:31.840
 but I'm of a certain age where my mortality is more pressing or more obvious to me than it once

1:32:31.840 --> 1:32:44.160
 was. And I don't dread that. I don't see that as, in a certain sense, even the enemy.

1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:50.720
 You're not afraid of death? Well, I'm afraid of lots of things in a conceptual way, but it

1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:59.920
 doesn't keep me awake at night. Like most people, I'm more afraid of pain than I am of death.

1:32:59.920 --> 1:33:05.040
 So I don't want to put myself forward as some kind of hero that doesn't worry about these

1:33:05.040 --> 1:33:12.560
 things. That's not true. But I do think, and maybe this is part of my Christian outlook,

1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:22.640
 that there is life beyond the grave. But I don't think that that it's life in this universe or in

1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:28.800
 this, certainly not in this body, and maybe not in a certain sense in this mind. I mean,

1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:34.240
 you know, Christian belief in the afterlife is that we will be resurrected. We will,

1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:37.840
 in a certain sense, be with God. I don't know what that means. And I don't think anybody else

1:33:37.840 --> 1:33:42.480
 really quite knows what that means. But there are lots of ways that over history, people,

1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:49.360
 artists and writers and so forth have pictured it. And these are all perhaps some of them helpful

1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:53.360
 ways of thinking about it. Do you think it's possible to know what happens after we die?

1:33:53.360 --> 1:34:00.160
 I don't think we find out by near death experiences or those kinds of things. But

1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:09.760
 I think that we have sufficient, I feel I have sufficient information, if you like,

1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:18.560
 in terms of God's revelation to be confident that I will go somewhere else, okay? But it won't be

1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:30.880
 here. And I, to me, the aspirations of transhumanism are horrific. I mean, I think it would be a

1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:38.160
 nightmare, not a dream, a nightmare, you know, to be somehow downloaded into a computer and

1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:46.000
 live one's life like that. Because it completely discounts the integrity of our bodies as well

1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:55.360
 as our minds. I mean, we aren't just disembodied minds. It would not be me that was in the computer.

1:34:55.360 --> 1:35:00.560
 It would be something else if that kind of download were possible. Of course, it isn't

1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:05.120
 possible. And it's very long way from being possible. But, you know, amazing things happen.

1:35:05.120 --> 1:35:11.440
 So we shouldn't be too certain. So this is a place that, again, maybe taking a slight step

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:20.320
 outside, we're philosophizing a little bit. Let me ask you about human level or superhuman level

1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:30.560
 intelligence, the artificial intelligence systems. What do you make from almost a religious or a

1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:37.760
 perspective that we've been talking about of the special aspect of human nature of us creating

1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:44.800
 intelligence systems that exhibit some elements of that human nature? Is that something, again,

1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:49.680
 like we were talking about with transhumanism, there's a feasibility question of how hard is it

1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:54.080
 to actually build machines that are human level intelligence or have something like consciousness

1:35:54.080 --> 1:36:01.280
 or have all those kinds of human qualities. And then there's the, do we want to do that kind of

1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:07.920
 thing? So both of those directions, what do you think? Well, okay. So, you know, since your podcast

1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:14.480
 is called AI, I don't want to offend too many of your listeners out there. But I think one should

1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:20.560
 be a little bit more modest about one's claims for AI than have typically been the case. I think

1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:26.160
 that actually a lot of people in AI are somewhat chastened. And so there are more modest claims

1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:35.280
 than are common with the transhumanists and so forth. And, you know, I used to play chess when

1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:42.640
 I was a kid. I was pretty good at it, okay, won competitions and so on and so forth. And I, when

1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:47.680
 I'm talking about when I was in high school, I thought it was pretty unlikely that a computer

1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:52.960
 would be able to become good at chess, but I was dead wrong. Okay. And so, you know,

1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:56.640
 how did that make you feel, by the way, when, do you blew big?

1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:03.840
 I stopped playing chess seriously when I, when I encountered computers that could beat me. Okay.

1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:11.200
 I still play with my grandchildren a little bit, but, but, but yeah, it seemed like, in a certain

1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:17.680
 sense, it became a solved problem when AI was able to do it better than I could. So I think that

1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:25.600
 there are ways in which today, we've seen computers do things which historically were regarded as being

1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:33.520
 very characteristic of human intelligence. And in that sense, there, there is some success to AI.

1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:40.320
 I also think that, you know, there are certain things which one might think of as being AI,

1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:44.640
 which are, you know, completely widespread in our society. I'm thinking about the internet

1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:54.000
 search engines and so forth, which are enormously influential and obviously do things more powerfully

1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:02.720
 than any individual human or even any combination of humans could do much faster and, and accessing

1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:10.320
 databases and so on and so forth. All of this is outstripped our human intelligence.

1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:17.600
 I'm not sure the extent to which that is really intelligence in the way that was traditionally

1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:27.840
 meant, but it's certainly amazingly facile and it, it multiplies our ability to access human

1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:33.280
 knowledge and, and data and so forth. So is that something, is that, is that enter the realm of

1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:39.120
 something where we should be concerned about? So in the realm of religion, you talk about what

1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:44.000
 is good, what is evil, what is right, what is wrong, you have a set of morals, set of beliefs.

1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:49.920
 And when you have an entity come into the picture that, that has quite a bit of power,

1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:56.480
 if we potentially look into the future and intelligence and capability, do you think

1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:04.000
 there's something that religion can say about artificial intelligence? Or is that something

1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:10.000
 you, we shouldn't worry about until it arrives, you think, just like with the chess program?

1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:13.920
 You know, religious writers have thought about this for centuries.

1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:21.440
 You know, there's been a long debate about what is, what is historically called the plurality

1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:29.680
 of worlds. And it was actually more about whether there are places where other intelligent creatures

1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:35.840
 live than it was about us creating them. But, but I think it's largely the same question.

1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:40.560
 It's almost like aliens, like other intelligence. So if there is other intelligent life in the

1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:46.240
 universe, what is its relationship to God? Okay, that is, in a certain sense, the puzzle

1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:50.880
 that religious thinkers and writers have thought about for a long time. And there's a whole range

1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:56.000
 of, of different opinions about that. I mean, personally, you know, I think it's, it's an

1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:01.760
 interesting question, but it's not a very pressing question at the moment. And I think the same way

1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:07.520
 about the, the question of what happens if we're able to build a sentient robot, for example.

1:40:08.480 --> 1:40:11.840
 I think it's an interesting question and we'll have to think about it when that happens.

1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:16.880
 But I think we're still quite a ways away from that. And so I don't have a good answer.

1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:22.000
 But I think there's a literature that you, one could tap to think about.

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:27.520
 Okay. Do you want to start early on the question? Well, let me ask you another

1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:32.000
 impossible question from a religious or from a personal perspective. What do you think is

1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:38.720
 consciousness, this, this subjective experience that we seem to be having? There's,

1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:45.040
 there's, there's a, the Christian religion have something to say about consciousness,

1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:49.520
 does your own, when you look in the mirror, do you have a sense of what is consciousness?

1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:56.400
 I think the Bible doesn't have much in the way of answers about that directly in the sense that

1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:01.360
 you're perhaps asking it, which is more like, I think you're asking for some kind of scientific,

1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:06.880
 quasi scientific or maybe indeed scientific description. That's really looking for one.

1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:12.880
 Yes. I think that, I think that there, it's an interesting question. I think it's actually,

1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:19.360
 it's a jump too far. I think we have, we don't even know the answer to the question,

1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:24.320
 what is the mind to let alone consciousness? So if you distinguish between those two things,

1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:30.480
 I think the question that's being addressed more directly, scientifically, as well as in other

1:41:30.480 --> 1:41:38.320
 ways, it is what is the mind. And that is certainly a very topical question, even in places like MIT,

1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:43.120
 which is not historically involved with philosophical questions, you know, that people are doing

1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:49.280
 neuroscience and so forth. I think it's a very important question. And I think that we're going

1:41:49.280 --> 1:42:02.960
 to find that we are not computers. In other words, I think the commonplace theory of what mind is,

1:42:02.960 --> 1:42:12.320
 is generally speaking by analogy that we are basically wet, wetware. Okay. That we're some

1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:22.880
 computer like entity. And that the analogy to digital computers is a pretty decent one. I mean,

1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:30.240
 that's of course, a viewpoint, which, you know, which drives the aspirations of the transhumanists.

1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:35.520
 I mean, they so much believe that our minds are nothing other than, you know, in a certain sense,

1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:40.560
 some kind of implementation of software in biology that they say to themselves, well,

1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:46.320
 of course, we're going to be able to download it into a, into a digital computer. I don't think

1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:54.800
 that's true. I think it's most likely that quantum mechanics is very important in the brain.

1:42:54.800 --> 1:43:01.520
 It seems most unlikely that it's not to me. I know that that's contrary to the opinions of many

1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:06.880
 people. But, but that's my view. And it's also a view, for example, of people like Roger Penrose

1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:12.960
 and people like that who've written about it rather extensively. And if that's the case,

1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:22.800
 then really my mind is not reproduced, reducible to some kind of software which can be considered to

1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:31.840
 be portable. It is so connected to the hardware of my body that the two are inseparable. Okay.

1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:38.560
 And so if that is in fact what we find, as I suspect will be the case, then the aspirations

1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:45.760
 of the transhumanists will be very long in coming, if at all. So I think that actually

1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:54.960
 physics and chemistry, you know, are in a, are in a sense involved with the brain and within the

1:43:54.960 --> 1:44:03.200
 mind, but not in a very simple way, like, you know, like the computer analogy in a much more

1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:16.400
 complicated way. And I, and I also think that it's philosophically ignorant to speak as if

1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:24.720
 when and if the actions of the brain are understood at the physical and chemical level,

1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:31.520
 that will mean that the mind will vanish as a concept, you know, that will just say,

1:44:31.520 --> 1:44:38.160
 we're nothing but brains. Okay. Of course it won't. I mean, it may well be that our mind is

1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:44.480
 an emergent phenomenon that comes out of the physics and chemistry and biology. Okay. But

1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:52.000
 it's also something that we have to encounter and take seriously. And so, you know, it's,

1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:59.840
 it's not the case that it, that the mind is reducible to nothing but physics and chemistry,

1:44:59.840 --> 1:45:06.240
 even if it's embedded in, you know, continuously into physics and chemistry as I rather suspect it

1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:15.440
 is. So that, that's my own view. I mean, another way of putting it is that the mind or the soul

1:45:15.440 --> 1:45:23.920
 is not something added into humans as might have been the viewpoint. Historically, I do think there

1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:29.040
 is, you know, there is something added to humans, but it's not, it's not the mind, it's the spirit.

1:45:29.040 --> 1:45:34.160
 And that takes us beyond the physical, it takes us beyond this universe. But I, but I don't think

1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:39.280
 that, that consciousness, the mind, et cetera, et cetera, is that thing which is necessarily

1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:45.200
 added in explicitly. So I'm not emergent in some way. I'm not a substance dualist in that sense.

1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:52.880
 Okay. If you want to put it philosophically, I mean, but your sense is, so the mind and the

1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:58.000
 intelligence and consciousness can be these emergent things. Do you have, do you have a hope,

1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:03.440
 a sense that science could help us get it pretty far down the road of understanding?

1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:09.280
 Oh, we will get much further than we have. And we, it'll be interesting.

1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:18.080
 I mean, right now our, our methods of diagnosing the human brain are extremely primitive. I mean,

1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:26.240
 the resolution that we have, you know, that comes out of, out of NMR and brain scans and so forth

1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:31.680
 is miserable compared with what we need in order to understand the brain at the cellular level,

1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:38.240
 let alone at the, at the atomic level. But, you know, we're making progress. It's relatively

1:46:38.240 --> 1:46:42.080
 slow progress, but it's progress and people are working on it and we're going to get better at it.

1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:48.160
 And we will find out very interesting things as we do. The time resolution is also completely

1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:53.840
 hopeless compared, compared with what we need to understand the thought, you know. So, so there's

1:46:53.840 --> 1:47:00.320
 a long way to go and we will get better at it. But I'm, but I'm not at all worried, as some people

1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:08.400
 are, and some people speak as if it's a good thing, that somehow the concepts of humanity and

1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:15.840
 the mind and religion and, and consciousness are going to vanish because we're going to have,

1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:22.400
 you know, complete physical, chemical description of the brain in the near future that we're not

1:47:22.400 --> 1:47:26.480
 going to have that. And secondly, even if we had it, the mind and all these other things aren't

1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:32.800
 going to vanish because of it. Well, I find kind of compelling that the notion that whoever created

1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:44.160
 this universe and us did so to understand itself, himself. I mean, there's a, there's a,

1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:51.920
 there's a powerful self reflection notion to this whole experiment that we're a part of.

1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:58.400
 Well, I certainly think that God takes delight in his creation and that it was created for that

1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:06.720
 delight as much as it was for any other reason. And that, you know, that therefore there's reason

1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:13.200
 to be hopeful and, and awestruck by the creation, whether it's on the very small or on the very

1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:17.840
 large. I'm not sure if you're familiar. There's something called the simulation hypothesis.

1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:24.160
 Well, that's been fun to talk about with the computer scientists and so on, which is a,

1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:31.360
 a kind of thought experiment that proposes that, you know, the entirety of the world around us

1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:35.840
 is a kind of a computer program. That's a simulation and then we're living inside it.

1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:42.000
 I think there's, I think from a certain perspective, that could be consistent with

1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:47.840
 a religious view of the world. I mean, you could just use different terms, basically.

1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:55.520
 What are your, but it's a, it's a, it feels like a more modern updated version of that.

1:48:56.720 --> 1:49:02.560
 But what is, what's, what's your sense of this or the simulation hypothesis that you find

1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:07.680
 interesting, useful to think about to define a ridiculous, and you find it fun. What are your

1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:15.600
 thoughts? It's fun. And it's been, of course, the subject of various movies that, that some

1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:25.120
 of which are very well known. You know, I don't think it makes sense to think of it as a simulation

1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:36.080
 hypothesis in the sense that we're really lying in banks of, of, on banks of beds,

1:49:36.080 --> 1:49:42.000
 having our energy drained away from us and, and the simulation is going on in our individual

1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:47.280
 brains. That makes no sense to me at all. I don't think that's what's meant by the simulation

1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:54.400
 hypothesis as, as you're using it now. But I think that there is a, there is very little

1:49:54.400 --> 1:50:04.080
 distinction between saying that an intelligent creator has set up the universe according to

1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:15.200
 his will and his plan and set it in motion and is allowing it to run out. Maybe, as Christians say,

1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:22.880
 he's sustaining it, actually, by his word of power, it says in the book, the letter to Hebrews.

1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:34.320
 Okay. In, in, in this amazingly consistent and integrated way. I don't think there's very

1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.800
 much difference between saying that and saying that it's a simulation. Okay. I mean, I think

1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:45.120
 it's almost the same thing. Okay. But I, but I think from, but I think it's important to recognize

1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:52.400
 that the simulation in that concept, the simulation and the creation or the, or the universe are the

1:50:52.400 --> 1:51:01.040
 same thing. Okay. In other words, it's a simulation, you know, that is billions of light years across.

1:51:01.040 --> 1:51:07.760
 Okay. Yeah. I mean, there, there's a sense in which it helps one understand, especially if you're

1:51:07.760 --> 1:51:13.520
 not religious, that there's something outside of the world that we live in, that there's

1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:18.320
 something bigger than the world we live in. And that, I mean, it's just another perspective on

1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:24.960
 that humbles, humbles you. So in that sense, it's a powerful thought experiment.

1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:31.680
 What's shortcoming of that is, is the following is of the, of the analogy is this, that we think

1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:37.520
 of a simulation as something take, taking place in the universe. You know, when we, it's, it's

1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:46.640
 taking place in my computer. Okay. I don't think that's the right analogy for Christian view of

1:51:46.640 --> 1:51:55.200
 creation. Okay. I don't think it's taking place in some other universe that God has made. Okay.

1:51:55.200 --> 1:52:01.520
 I think maybe it's taking place in the mind of God. Christians might hypothesize also,

1:52:01.520 --> 1:52:07.840
 but I, but I think that, that, that it's important to recognize that Christian theology at any rate

1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:14.880
 is that God is not one of the entities in the universe and, and presumably, therefore is

1:52:14.880 --> 1:52:18.080
 very different from a simulation that we might run on a computer.

1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:25.040
 Let me ask you, Adam and Eve, even Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and

1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:28.880
 evil. Does this, is this story meaningful to you? What does the story mean to you?

1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:35.920
 Yeah, I, it is meaningful to me. I take the, you know, the writings of the Bible very seriously,

1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:40.640
 and I think that most Christians regard them as having some kind of authoritative

1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:49.360
 role in their, in their, in their faith. What do I get from it? I mean, I think the most important

1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:54.320
 thing that Christians get from the story of Adam and Eve and eating the apple and so forth

1:52:54.320 --> 1:53:02.320
 is that the relationship between humans and God is broken, has been broken by man's disobedience.

1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:10.960
 That's what the story of Adam and Eve and the apple is all about. And that broken relationship

1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:22.400
 is, for Christians, what Jesus came to redeem, came to overcome that brokenness and restore

1:53:22.400 --> 1:53:33.840
 that relationship with God. To some extent at any rate on earth and ultimately, you know,

1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:39.840
 in, in the, in eternity to restore it fully. So that's the really what Christians mean

1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:45.920
 and gain from the story of Adam and Eve. Of course, lots of people ask the questions about how

1:53:45.920 --> 1:53:52.640
 sort, how literally should we take these stories of particularly the first few, few chapters of Genesis,

1:53:52.640 --> 1:53:59.360
 which is an important question. But, but I mean, but we tend to get bogged down with it a bit too

1:53:59.360 --> 1:54:08.000
 much. I think we should take away the message. And I think the, the, the, what the, what actually

1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:14.080
 we would have seen if we'd been there, okay, is something which is a matter of speculation. And

1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:18.000
 it's certainly not terribly important from the point of view of Christian theology.

1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:22.880
 But it seems like a very important moment. As a man of faith, do you,

1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:27.760
 do you, do you wish that, I think it was Eve first?

1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:29.360
 Yeah, we'll see if that.

1:54:31.200 --> 1:54:33.040
 Do you wish that, by the way, it was just a fruit.

1:54:33.040 --> 1:54:33.680
 It was a fruit.

1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:34.720
 You said it very carefully.

1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:41.840
 It was the fruit, the fruit of the tree, right? Do you wish they wouldn't have eaten of the tree?

1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:46.400
 I mean, this is a, back to our discussion of suffering. Was that like an essential thing

1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:53.680
 that needed to happen? You're going to have to read Paradise Lost to get your answer to that.

1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:02.400
 Beautifully put. Okay. Well, let me ask the, the biggest question, one that you also touched

1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:07.760
 in your book, but one that I asked every once in a while is what is the meaning of life?

1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:17.760
 The meaning of my life is many different things. Okay. But it, but they are all kind of centered

1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:26.080
 around relationships. I mean, for a Christian, one's relationship with God is

1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:33.520
 a crucial part of the meaning of life. But one's relationship with one's family,

1:55:33.520 --> 1:55:41.520
 wives, wife, parents, children, grandchildren, in my case, and so forth. Those are crucially

1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:48.640
 important. These are all the places where people, whether they're religious or not, find meaning.

1:55:51.360 --> 1:56:00.720
 But ultimately, I think a person who has faith in a creator, who we think has

1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:11.200
 a, an intention or many intentions, but a will in respect of the world as a whole,

1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:22.560
 that's a crucial part of meaning. And the idea that my life might have some small significance

1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:32.800
 in the plan of that creator is an amazingly powerful idea that brings meaning.

1:56:35.040 --> 1:56:40.480
 I tell a story in my book that when I was a student, before I became a Christian, I read a

1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:45.520
 philosophy book whose approximate title was, you know, what is the meaning of life? And,

1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:50.320
 you know, that book basically said, there is no meaning to life, you have to make up the meaning

1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:57.920
 as you go along. And I think that's probably the, the predominant secular view is these days that

1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:02.400
 there is no real meaning, but you can make up a meaning and that will give you meaning into your

1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:10.640
 life. I don't subscribe to that view anymore. I think there is more meaning than that. But I do

1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:15.280
 think that those things which give meaning to a life are very important and we should emphasize them.

1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:21.760
 And you, you have said that as the part of the, as the part of that meaning is the part of your

1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:33.520
 faith, love and loyalty are key parts. So can you try to say what is love and loyalty? Like what,

1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:47.680
 what does it mean to you? What does it look like if you were to give advice to your

1:57:48.640 --> 1:57:57.280
 children and grandchildren of what to look for in looking for loyalty and love? What would you try

1:57:57.280 --> 1:58:06.080
 to say? Well, I think it's something like yielding your will or desire to another.

1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:17.360
 It's valuing others more highly or at least as highly as yourself. But that's just the start of

1:58:17.360 --> 1:58:28.160
 it because true love, you reach a point where you are, you feel compelled by the other. And that,

1:58:29.040 --> 1:58:35.120
 I think to some people sounds very scary, but actually it's terrifically liberating.

1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:50.000
 And I think that love then brings you into service towards another. And I'm reminded of the phrase

1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:57.760
 from the Anglican prayer book where it talks about Jesus whose service is perfect freedom. In other

1:58:57.760 --> 1:59:05.120
 words, for us Christians to serve God is what perfects our freedom. And I think there is an

1:59:05.120 --> 1:59:17.680
 amazing love is in part captivity, but in a kind of paradoxical sense, it's also an amazing freedom.

1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:23.520
 Love is freedom. I don't think there's a better way to end it. We started with fusion energy

1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:29.120
 and ending on love. Ian, there's a huge honor to talk to you. Thank you so much for your time today.

2:00:24.880 --> 2:00:30.160
 I would like to assure my many Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish and Muslim friends that I am

2:00:30.160 --> 2:00:36.400
 sincerely happy that the religion which chance has given you has contributed to your peace of mind

2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:42.560
 and often as Western medical science now reluctantly admits to your physical well being.

2:00:42.560 --> 2:00:50.480
 Perhaps it is better to be unsane and happy than sane and unhappy. But it is the best of all to be

2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:56.800
 sane and happy. Whether our descendants can achieve that goal will be the greatest challenge of the

2:00:56.800 --> 2:01:04.800
 future. Indeed, it may well decide whether we have any future. Thank you for listening and hope to see

2:01:04.800 --> 2:01:15.360
 you next time.
