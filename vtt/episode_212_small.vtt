 The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach, his second time in the podcast.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.760
 Yosha is one of the most fascinating minds in the world, exploring the nature of intelligence,

00:10.760 --> 00:14.560
 cognition, computation, and consciousness.

00:26.960 --> 00:33.560
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Yosha Bach.

00:33.560 --> 00:38.880
 Thank you for once again coming on to this particular Russian program and sticking to

00:38.880 --> 00:40.880
 the theme of a Russian program.

00:40.880 --> 00:45.320
 Let's start with the darkest of topics.

00:45.320 --> 00:48.520
 So this is inspired by one of your tweets.

00:48.520 --> 00:56.600
 You wrote that, quote, when life feels unbearable, I remind myself that I'm not a person.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.640
 I am a piece of software running on the brain of a random ape for a few decades.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.720
 It's not the worst brain to run on.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.800
 Have you experienced low points in your life?

01:07.800 --> 01:09.840
 Have you experienced depression?

01:09.840 --> 01:15.400
 Of course, we all experience low points in our life, and we get appalled by the things,

01:15.400 --> 01:17.080
 by the ugliness of stuff around us.

01:17.080 --> 01:24.800
 We might get desperate about our lack of self regulation, and sometimes life is hard.

01:24.800 --> 01:29.960
 And I suspect you don't get to your life, nobody does, to get to their life without

01:29.960 --> 01:33.920
 low points and without moments where they are despairing.

01:33.920 --> 01:40.480
 And I thought that let's capture this state and how to deal with that state.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.960
 And I found that very often you realize that when you stop taking things personally, when

01:44.960 --> 01:50.760
 you realize that this notion of a person is a fiction, similar as it is in Westworld where

01:50.760 --> 01:55.000
 the robots realize that their memories and desires are just stuff that keeps them in

01:55.000 --> 02:00.120
 the loop, and they don't have to act on those memories and desires, that our memories and

02:00.120 --> 02:02.640
 expectations is what make us unhappy.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.480
 And the present rarely does.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.200
 The day in which we are, for the most part, it's okay, right?

02:08.200 --> 02:13.200
 When we are sitting here, right here, right now, we can choose how we feel.

02:13.200 --> 02:18.880
 And the thing that affects us is the expectation that something is going to be different from

02:18.880 --> 02:24.320
 what we wanted to be or the memory that something was different from what we wanted it to be.

02:24.320 --> 02:29.520
 And once we basically zoom out from all this, what's left is not a person, what's left

02:29.520 --> 02:33.760
 is this state of being conscious, which is a software state.

02:33.760 --> 02:37.920
 And software doesn't have an identity, it's a physical law.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.400
 And it's a law that acts in all of us, and it's embedded in a suitable substrate.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.760
 And we didn't pick that substrate, right?

02:43.760 --> 02:47.040
 We are mostly randomly instantiated on it.

02:47.040 --> 02:52.120
 And they're all these individuals, and everybody has to be one of them.

02:52.120 --> 02:56.200
 And eventually, you're stuck on one of them and have to deal with that.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.400
 So you're like a leaf floating down the river.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.960
 You just have to accept that there's a river and you just float wherever there takes you.

03:03.960 --> 03:04.960
 You don't have to do this.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.480
 The thing is that the illusion that you are an agent is a construct.

03:09.480 --> 03:13.440
 And what part of that is actually under your control.

03:13.440 --> 03:18.640
 And I think that our consciousness is largely a control model for our own attention.

03:18.640 --> 03:23.080
 So we notice where we are looking and we can influence what we are looking, how we are

03:23.080 --> 03:26.920
 disambiguating things, how we put things together in our mind.

03:26.920 --> 03:31.040
 And the whole system that runs us is this big cybernetic motivational system.

03:31.040 --> 03:35.120
 So we're basically like a little monkey sitting on top of an elephant.

03:35.120 --> 03:39.600
 And we can prod this elephant here and there to go this way or that way.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.080
 And we might have the illusion that we are the elephant or that we are telling it what

03:43.080 --> 03:44.080
 to do.

03:44.080 --> 03:47.600
 And sometimes we notice that it walks into a completely different direction.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.160
 And we didn't set this thing up.

03:49.160 --> 03:52.800
 It just is the situation that we find ourselves in.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.440
 How much prodding can we actually do of the elephant?

03:56.440 --> 03:57.560
 A lot.

03:57.560 --> 04:03.120
 But I think that our consciousness cannot create the motive force.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.440
 Is the elephant consciousness in this metaphor?

04:05.440 --> 04:08.040
 No, the monkey is the consciousness.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.600
 The monkey is the attentional system that is observing things.

04:10.600 --> 04:15.440
 There's a large perceptual system combined with a motivational system that is actually

04:15.440 --> 04:20.240
 providing the interface to everything and our own consciousness, I think, is the tool

04:20.240 --> 04:25.760
 that directs the attention of that system, which means it singles out features and performs

04:25.760 --> 04:29.080
 conditional operations for which it needs an index memory.

04:29.080 --> 04:32.880
 But this index memory is what we perceive as our stream of consciousness.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.080
 But the consciousness is not in charge.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.080
 That's an illusion.

04:36.080 --> 04:41.520
 So everything outside of that consciousness is the elephant.

04:41.520 --> 04:46.160
 So it's the physics of the universe, but it's also society that's outside of your...

04:46.160 --> 04:48.440
 I would say the elephant is the agent.

04:48.440 --> 04:53.120
 So there is an environment through which the agent is stomping, and you are influencing

04:53.120 --> 04:55.240
 a little part of that agent.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.800
 So is the agent a single human being?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.520
 What which object has agency?

05:02.520 --> 05:03.840
 That's an interesting question.

05:03.840 --> 05:10.600
 I think a way to think about an agent is that it's a controller with a set point generator.

05:10.600 --> 05:15.040
 The notion of a controller comes from cybernetics and control theory.

05:15.040 --> 05:22.280
 Control system consists out of a system that is regulating some value and the deviation

05:22.280 --> 05:24.120
 of that value from a set point.

05:24.120 --> 05:30.080
 And it has a sensor that measures the system's deviation from that set point and an effector

05:30.080 --> 05:32.760
 that can be parameterized by the controller.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.720
 So the controller tells the effector to do a certain thing.

05:35.720 --> 05:40.480
 And the goal is to reduce the distance between the set point and the current value of the

05:40.480 --> 05:41.480
 system.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.400
 And there's an environment which disturbs the regulated system, which brings it away

05:44.400 --> 05:45.720
 from that set point.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.000
 So the simplest case is the thermostat.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.360
 The thermostat is really simple because it doesn't have a model.

05:50.360 --> 05:56.120
 The thermostat is only trying to minimize the set point deviation in the next moment.

05:56.120 --> 06:00.760
 And if you want to minimize the set point deviation over a longer time span, you need to integrate

06:00.760 --> 06:03.800
 it, you need to model what is going to happen.

06:03.800 --> 06:08.480
 So for instance, when you think about that your set point is to be comfortable in life,

06:08.480 --> 06:11.480
 maybe you need to make yourself uncomfortable first.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.120
 So you need to make a model of what's going to happen when.

06:14.120 --> 06:19.480
 And this is the task of the controller is to use its sensors to measure the state of

06:19.480 --> 06:25.120
 the environment and the system that is being regulated and figure out what to do.

06:25.120 --> 06:30.360
 And if the task is complex enough, the set points are complicated enough.

06:30.360 --> 06:35.640
 And if the controller has enough capacity and enough sensor feedback, then the task

06:35.640 --> 06:39.680
 of the controller is to make a model of the entire universe that it's in, the conditions

06:39.680 --> 06:42.480
 under which it exists and of itself.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.960
 And this is a very complex agent and we are in that category.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.560
 And an agent is not necessarily a thing in the universe.

06:49.560 --> 06:54.680
 It's a class of models that we use to interpret aspects of the universe.

06:54.680 --> 06:59.760
 And when we notice the environment around us, a lot of things only make sense at the level

06:59.760 --> 07:03.600
 that should we're entangled with them, we interpret them as control systems that make

07:03.600 --> 07:07.200
 models of the world and try to minimize their own set points.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.600
 So the models are the agents?

07:10.600 --> 07:12.680
 The agent is a class of model.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.680
 And we notice that we are an agent ourselves.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.800
 We are the agent that is using our own control model to perform actions.

07:18.800 --> 07:23.560
 We notice we would use a change in the model and things in the world change.

07:23.560 --> 07:28.200
 And this is how we discover the idea that we have a body, that we are a situated environment

07:28.200 --> 07:31.400
 and that we do have a first person perspective.

07:31.400 --> 07:38.120
 Still don't understand what's the best way to think of which object has agency with respect

07:38.120 --> 07:40.160
 to human beings.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.640
 Is it the body?

07:41.640 --> 07:43.520
 Is it the brain?

07:43.520 --> 07:46.120
 Is it the contents of the brain that has agency?

07:46.120 --> 07:49.560
 Like what's the actuators that you're referring to?

07:49.560 --> 07:52.200
 What is the controller and where does it reside?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.200
 Or is it these impossible things?

07:54.200 --> 07:59.720
 Because I keep trying to ground it to space time, the three dimension of space and the

07:59.720 --> 08:01.840
 one dimension of time.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.320
 What's the agent in that for humans?

08:04.320 --> 08:06.120
 There is not just one.

08:06.120 --> 08:10.480
 It depends on the way in which you're looking at the thing in which you're framing it.

08:10.480 --> 08:16.880
 Imagine that you are, say, Angela Merkel and you are acting on behalf of Germany.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.040
 And you could say that Germany is the agent.

08:20.040 --> 08:25.080
 And in the mind of Angela Merkel, she is Germany to some extent because in the way in which

08:25.080 --> 08:28.160
 she acts, the destiny of Germany changes.

08:28.160 --> 08:32.640
 There are things that she can change that basically affect the behavior of that nation

08:32.640 --> 08:33.640
 state.

08:33.640 --> 08:34.640
 Okay.

08:34.640 --> 08:40.280
 So it's hierarchies to go to another one of your tweets with, I think you're playfully

08:40.280 --> 08:45.960
 mocking Jeff Hawkins with saying his brain's all the way down.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.680
 So it's like, it's agents all the way down.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.920
 It's agents made up of agents, made up of agents.

08:51.920 --> 08:57.080
 Like if Angela Merkel is Germany and Germany is made up a bunch of people and the people

08:57.080 --> 09:01.200
 are themselves agents in some kind of context.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.080
 And then people are made up of cells, each individual.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.240
 So is it agents all the way down?

09:07.240 --> 09:13.120
 I suspect that has to be like this in a world where things are self organizing.

09:13.120 --> 09:18.640
 Most of the complexity that we are looking at, everything in life is about self organization.

09:18.640 --> 09:24.480
 So I think up from the level of life, you have agents.

09:24.480 --> 09:30.640
 And below life, you rarely have agents because sometimes you have control systems that emerge

09:30.640 --> 09:35.880
 randomly in nature and try to achieve a set point, but they're not that interesting agents

09:35.880 --> 09:36.880
 that make models.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.920
 And because to make an interesting model of the world, you typically need a system that

09:40.920 --> 09:41.920
 is during complete.

09:41.920 --> 09:46.360
 Can I ask you a personal question?

09:46.360 --> 09:48.960
 What's the line between life and non life?

09:48.960 --> 09:52.360
 It's personal because you're a life form.

09:52.360 --> 09:57.440
 So what do you think in this emerging complexity, at which point does the things that are being

09:57.440 --> 09:59.280
 living and have agency?

09:59.280 --> 10:03.600
 Personally, I think that the simplest answer that is that life is cells.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.600
 Because...

10:04.600 --> 10:05.600
 Life is what?

10:05.600 --> 10:06.600
 Cells.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.600
 Cells.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.600
 Biological cells.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.280
 So it's a particular kind of principle that we have discovered to exist in nature.

10:12.280 --> 10:19.240
 It's modular stuff that consists out of basically this DNA tape with a redried head on top

10:19.240 --> 10:25.800
 of it that is able to perform arbitrary computations and state transitions within the cell.

10:25.800 --> 10:31.120
 And it's combined with a membrane that insulates the cell from its environment.

10:31.120 --> 10:36.840
 And there are chemical reactions inside of the cell that are in disequilibrium.

10:36.840 --> 10:41.960
 And the cell is running in such a way that this disequilibrium doesn't disappear.

10:41.960 --> 10:46.720
 And if the cell goes into an equilibrium state, it dies.

10:46.720 --> 10:52.360
 And it requires some things like a neck entropy extractor to maintain this disequilibrium.

10:52.360 --> 10:58.360
 So it's able to harvest neck entropy from its environment and keep itself running.

10:58.360 --> 11:04.560
 So there's information and there's a wall to maintain this disequilibrium.

11:04.560 --> 11:08.840
 But isn't this very earth centric like what you're referring to as...

11:08.840 --> 11:11.160
 I'm not making a normative notion.

11:11.160 --> 11:15.360
 You could say that there are probably other things in the universe that are cell like

11:15.360 --> 11:16.840
 and life like.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.280
 And you could also call them life.

11:18.280 --> 11:24.120
 But eventually it's just a willingness to find an agreement of how to use the terms.

11:24.120 --> 11:29.000
 I like cells because it's completely co extension of this the way that we use the word even

11:29.000 --> 11:30.720
 before we knew about cells.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.720
 So people were pointing at some stuff and saying, this is somehow animate.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.920
 And this is very different from the non animate stuff.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.480
 And what's the difference between the living and the dead stuff?

11:40.480 --> 11:43.280
 And it's mostly whether the cells are working or not.

11:43.280 --> 11:48.080
 And also this boundary of life where we say that, for instance, the virus is basically

11:48.080 --> 11:52.840
 an information packet that is subverting the cell and not life by itself.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.600
 That makes sense to me.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.120
 And it's somewhat arbitrary.

11:56.120 --> 12:00.440
 You could of course say that systems that permanently maintain a disequilibrium and

12:00.440 --> 12:03.760
 can self replicate are always life.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.800
 And maybe that's a useful definition too.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.720
 But this is eventually just how you want to use the word.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.960
 Is it so useful for conversation?

12:12.960 --> 12:17.520
 But is it somehow fundamental to the universe?

12:17.520 --> 12:22.120
 Do you think there's a actual line to eventually be drawn between life and non life?

12:22.120 --> 12:24.440
 Or is it all kind of continuum?

12:24.440 --> 12:28.600
 I don't think it's a continuum, but there's nothing magical that is happening.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.440
 Living systems are a certain type of machine.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.240
 What about non living systems?

12:33.240 --> 12:34.600
 Is it also a machine?

12:34.600 --> 12:40.400
 There are non living machines, but the question is at which point is the system able to perform

12:40.400 --> 12:45.480
 arbitrary state transitions to make representations?

12:45.480 --> 12:47.120
 And living things can do this.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.880
 And of course, we can also build non living things that can do this, but we don't know

12:50.880 --> 12:56.800
 anything in nature that is not a cell and is not created by Stalala Life that is able

12:56.800 --> 13:00.480
 to do that.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.080
 Not only do we not know.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.320
 I don't think we have the tools to see otherwise.

13:06.320 --> 13:12.360
 I always worry that we look at the world too narrowly.

13:12.360 --> 13:18.320
 There could be life of a very different kind right under our noses that we're just not

13:18.320 --> 13:25.240
 seeing because we're not either limitations of our cognitive capacity or we're just not

13:25.240 --> 13:31.640
 open minded enough, either with the tools of science or just the tools of our mind.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.200
 Yeah, that's possible.

13:33.200 --> 13:39.360
 I find this thought very fascinating and I suspect that many of us ask ourselves in childhood,

13:39.360 --> 13:40.880
 what are the things that we are missing?

13:40.880 --> 13:48.160
 What kind of systems and interconnections exist that are outside of our gaze?

13:48.160 --> 13:57.920
 But we are looking for it and physics doesn't have much room at the moment for opening up

13:57.920 --> 14:02.800
 something that would not violate the conservation of information as we know it.

14:02.800 --> 14:11.640
 Yeah, but I wonder about time scale and spatial scale, whether we just need to open up our

14:11.640 --> 14:15.240
 idea of how life presents itself.

14:15.240 --> 14:20.040
 It could be operating in a much slower time scale, a much faster time scale.

14:20.040 --> 14:25.440
 It's almost sad to think that there's all this life around us that we're not seeing

14:25.440 --> 14:34.680
 because we're just not thinking in terms of the right scale, both time and space.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.320
 What is your definition of life?

14:36.320 --> 14:41.560
 What do you understand as life?

14:41.560 --> 14:51.920
 Entities of sufficiently high complexity, they're full of surprises.

14:51.920 --> 14:56.880
 I don't have a free will, so that just came out of my mouth, I'm not sure that even makes

14:56.880 --> 14:57.880
 sense.

14:57.880 --> 15:05.520
 There are certain characteristics, so complexity seems to be a necessary property of life and

15:05.520 --> 15:13.440
 I almost want to say it has ability to do something unexpected.

15:13.440 --> 15:19.720
 It seems to me that life is the main source of complexity on earth.

15:19.720 --> 15:27.760
 And complexity is basically a bridgehead that order builds into chaos by modeling, by processing

15:27.760 --> 15:32.720
 information in such a way that you can perform reactions that would not be possible for dump

15:32.720 --> 15:33.720
 systems.

15:33.720 --> 15:38.000
 And this means that you can harvest like entropy, that dump systems cannot harvest, and this

15:38.000 --> 15:40.280
 is what complexity is mostly about.

15:40.280 --> 15:46.520
 In some sense, the purpose of life is to create complexity.

15:46.520 --> 15:56.160
 I mean, there seems to be some kind of universal drive towards increasing pockets of complexity.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.720
 I don't know what that is.

15:57.720 --> 16:02.480
 That seems to be like a fundamental, I don't know if it's a property of the universe or

16:02.480 --> 16:08.640
 it's just a consequence of the way the universe works, but there seems to be this small pockets

16:08.640 --> 16:13.480
 of emergent complexity that builds on top of each other and starts having like greater

16:13.480 --> 16:18.240
 and greater complexity by having like a hierarchy of complexity.

16:18.240 --> 16:22.800
 Little organisms building up a little society that then operates almost as an individual

16:22.800 --> 16:27.880
 organism itself and all of a sudden you have Germany and Merkel.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.200
 That's not obvious to me.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.520
 Everything that goes up has to come down at some point, right?

16:32.520 --> 16:39.480
 So if you see this big exponential curve somewhere, it's usually the beginning of an S curve or

16:39.480 --> 16:43.360
 something eventually reaches saturation and the S curve is the beginning of some kind

16:43.360 --> 16:45.800
 of bump that goes down again.

16:45.800 --> 16:53.360
 And there is just this thing that when you are in sight of an evolution of life, you

16:53.360 --> 16:59.080
 are on top of a puddle of negentropy that is being sucked dry by life.

16:59.080 --> 17:04.120
 And during that happening, you see an increase in complexity because life forms are competing

17:04.120 --> 17:11.240
 with each other to get more and more and finer and finer corner of that negentropy extraction.

17:11.240 --> 17:16.560
 But I feel like that's a gradual, beautiful process like that almost follows a process

17:16.560 --> 17:18.320
 akin to evolution.

17:18.320 --> 17:22.480
 And the way it comes down is not the same way it came up.

17:22.480 --> 17:27.600
 The way it comes down is usually harshly and quickly.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.760
 So usually there's some kind of catastrophic event.

17:30.760 --> 17:35.000
 The Roman Empire took a long time.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.680
 But would that be, would you classify that as a decrease in complexity though?

17:39.680 --> 17:40.680
 Yes.

17:40.680 --> 17:44.920
 I think that this size of the cities that could be fed has decreased dramatically.

17:44.920 --> 17:50.280
 And you could see that the quality of the art decreased and it did so gradually.

17:50.280 --> 17:56.120
 And maybe future generations, when they look at the history of the United States in the

17:56.120 --> 18:00.720
 21st century, will also talk about the gradual decline, not something that suddenly happens.

18:00.720 --> 18:07.800
 Do you have a sense of where we are?

18:07.800 --> 18:09.800
 Are we on the exponential rise?

18:09.800 --> 18:10.800
 Are we at the peak?

18:10.800 --> 18:15.920
 Or are we at the downslope of the United States Empire?

18:15.920 --> 18:21.640
 It's very hard to say from a single human perspective, but it seems to me that we are

18:21.640 --> 18:25.400
 probably at the peak.

18:25.400 --> 18:29.760
 I think that's probably the definition of optimism and cynicism.

18:29.760 --> 18:37.920
 So my nature of optimism is, I think we're on the rise, but I think this is just all

18:37.920 --> 18:40.120
 the matter of perspective that nobody knows.

18:40.120 --> 18:45.560
 But I do think that erring on the side of optimism, like you need a sufficient number,

18:45.560 --> 18:51.040
 you need a minimum number of optimists in order to make that up thing actually work.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.560
 And so I tend to be on the side of the optimists.

18:53.560 --> 18:58.960
 I think that we are basically species of grasshoppers that have turned into locusts.

18:58.960 --> 19:03.920
 And when you are in that locust mode, you see an amazing rise of population numbers

19:03.920 --> 19:08.920
 and of the complexity of the interactions between the individuals.

19:08.920 --> 19:12.560
 But ultimately, the question is, is it sustainable?

19:12.560 --> 19:20.440
 See, I think we're a bunch of lions and tigers that have become domesticated cats to use

19:20.440 --> 19:21.440
 a different metaphor.

19:21.440 --> 19:27.240
 And so I'm not exactly sure we're so destructive or just softer and nicer and lazier.

19:27.240 --> 19:30.000
 I think we have monkeys and not the cats.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.720
 And if you look at the monkeys, they are very busy.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.120
 The ones that have a lot of sex, those monkeys?

19:36.120 --> 19:37.120
 Not just the bonobos.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.600
 I think that all the monkeys are basically a discontent species that always needs to

19:40.600 --> 19:41.600
 meddle.

19:41.600 --> 19:47.320
 Well, the gorillas seem to have a little bit more of a structure, but it's a different

19:47.320 --> 19:49.600
 part of the tree.

19:49.600 --> 19:57.760
 Okay, you mentioned the elephant and the monkey riding the elephant, and consciousness is

19:57.760 --> 20:00.520
 the monkey.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.280
 And there's some prodding that the monkey gets to do.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.160
 And sometimes the elephant listens.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.080
 I heard you got into some content.

20:09.080 --> 20:13.960
 Maybe you can correct me, but I heard you got into some contentious free will discussions.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.320
 Is this with Sam Harris or something like that?

20:16.320 --> 20:18.840
 Not that I know of.

20:18.840 --> 20:25.680
 People in clubhouse told me you made a bunch of big debate points about free will.

20:25.680 --> 20:32.400
 Well, let me just then ask you, where in terms of the monkey and the elephant, do you think

20:32.400 --> 20:35.440
 we land in terms of the illusion of free will?

20:35.440 --> 20:37.400
 How much control does the monkey have?

20:37.400 --> 20:43.320
 We have to think about what the free will is in the first place.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.320
 We are not the machine.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.600
 We are not the thing that is making the decisions.

20:46.600 --> 20:50.120
 We are a model of that decision making process.

20:50.120 --> 20:56.280
 And there is a difference between making your own decisions and predicting your own decisions.

20:56.280 --> 21:00.000
 And that difference is the first person perspective.

21:00.000 --> 21:07.240
 And what basically makes decision making and the conditions of free will distinct from

21:07.240 --> 21:12.920
 just automatically doing the best thing is that we often don't know what the best thing

21:12.920 --> 21:13.920
 is.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.560
 We make decisions under uncertainty.

21:15.560 --> 21:20.040
 We make informed bets using a betting algorithm that we don't yet understand because we haven't

21:20.040 --> 21:22.400
 reverse engineered our own minds efficiently.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.920
 We don't know the expected rewards.

21:23.920 --> 21:27.240
 We don't know the mechanism by which we estimate the rewards and so on.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.240
 But there is an algorithm.

21:28.240 --> 21:35.000
 We only observe ourselves performing where we see that we weight facts and factors and

21:35.000 --> 21:41.720
 the future and then some kind of possibility, some motive gets raised to an intention.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.640
 And that's informed bet that the system is making.

21:44.640 --> 21:48.320
 And that making of the informed bet, the representation of that is what we call free

21:48.320 --> 21:49.600
 will.

21:49.600 --> 21:54.040
 And it seems to be paradoxical because we think that's the crucial thing is about it

21:54.040 --> 21:56.680
 that it's somehow indeterministic.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.480
 And yet if it was indeterministic, it would be random.

22:00.480 --> 22:04.840
 And it cannot be random because if it was random, if just dice were being thrown in

22:04.840 --> 22:08.320
 the universe randomly forces you to do things, it would be meaningless.

22:08.320 --> 22:12.800
 So the important part of the decisions is always the deterministic stuff.

22:12.800 --> 22:17.000
 But it appears to be indeterministic to you because it's unpredictable.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.440
 Because if it was predictable, you wouldn't experience it as a free will decision.

22:21.440 --> 22:25.720
 You would experience it as just doing the necessary right thing.

22:25.720 --> 22:31.680
 And you see this continuum between the free will and the execution of automatic behavior

22:31.680 --> 22:33.280
 when you're observing other people.

22:33.280 --> 22:37.760
 So for instance, when you are observing your own children, if you don't understand them,

22:37.760 --> 22:43.480
 you will use this agent model where you have an agent with a set point generator.

22:43.480 --> 22:47.480
 And the agent is doing the best it can to minimize the difference to the set point.

22:47.480 --> 22:52.360
 And it might be confused and sometimes impulsive or whatever, but it's acting on its own free

22:52.360 --> 22:53.520
 will.

22:53.520 --> 22:58.760
 And when you understand what happens in the mind of the child, you see that it's automatic.

22:58.760 --> 23:03.360
 And you can outmodel the child, you can build things around the child that will lead the

23:03.360 --> 23:06.960
 child to making exactly the decision that you are predicting.

23:06.960 --> 23:11.880
 And under these circumstances, like when you were a stage misvision or somebody who is

23:11.880 --> 23:17.200
 dealing with people that you sell a car to, and you completely understand the psychology

23:17.200 --> 23:21.680
 and the impulses and the space of thoughts that this individual can have at that moment.

23:21.680 --> 23:26.240
 Under these circumstances, it makes no sense to attribute free will.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.320
 Because it's no longer decision making under uncertainty.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.320
 You are already certain.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.680
 For them, there's uncertainty, but you already know what they're doing.

23:32.680 --> 23:36.200
 But what about for you?

23:36.200 --> 23:44.560
 So is this akin to like systems like cellular automata, where it's deterministic, but when

23:44.560 --> 23:51.720
 you squint your eyes a little bit, it starts to look like there's agents making decisions

23:51.720 --> 23:57.880
 at the higher sort of when you zoom out and look at the entities that are composed by the

23:57.880 --> 23:59.680
 individual cells.

23:59.680 --> 24:07.400
 You know, there's underlying simple rules that make the system evolve in deterministic

24:07.400 --> 24:08.400
 ways.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.640
 It looks like there's organisms making decisions.

24:11.640 --> 24:15.360
 Is that where the illusion of free will emerges?

24:15.360 --> 24:17.600
 That jump in scale?

24:17.600 --> 24:21.480
 It's a particular type of model, but this jump in scale is crucial.

24:21.480 --> 24:25.160
 The jump in scale happens whenever you have too many parts to count, and you cannot make

24:25.160 --> 24:29.600
 a model at that level, and you try to find some higher level regularity.

24:29.600 --> 24:34.440
 And the higher level regularity is a pattern that you project into the world to make sense

24:34.440 --> 24:35.440
 of it.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.080
 And agency is one of these patterns, right?

24:37.080 --> 24:41.560
 You have all these cells that interact with each other, and the cells in our body are

24:41.560 --> 24:46.440
 set up in such a way that they benefit if their behavior is coherent, which means that

24:46.440 --> 24:51.360
 they act as if they were serving a common goal, and which that means that they will

24:51.360 --> 24:55.960
 evolve regulation mechanisms that act as if they were serving a common goal.

24:55.960 --> 25:00.280
 And now you can make sense of all these cells by projecting the common goal into them.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.280
 Right.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.320
 So for you, then, free will is an illusion?

25:03.320 --> 25:06.440
 No, it's a model, and it's a construct.

25:06.440 --> 25:10.280
 It's basically a model that the system is making of its own behavior, and it's the

25:10.280 --> 25:14.400
 best model that it can come up with under the circumstances, and it can get replaced

25:14.400 --> 25:18.600
 by a different model, which is automatic behavior, when you fully understand the mechanism under

25:18.600 --> 25:19.600
 which you are acting.

25:19.600 --> 25:24.480
 Yeah, but another word for model is what, story.

25:24.480 --> 25:27.920
 So the story you're telling, I mean, do you actually have control?

25:27.920 --> 25:34.120
 Is there such a thing as a you, and is there such a thing as you having control?

25:34.120 --> 25:42.080
 So like, are you manifesting your evolution as an entity?

25:42.080 --> 25:45.800
 In some sense, the you is the model of the system that is in control.

25:45.800 --> 25:51.120
 It's a story that the system tells itself about somebody who is in control.

25:51.120 --> 25:57.840
 And the contents of that model are being used to inform the behavior of the system.

25:57.840 --> 26:03.400
 So the system is completely mechanical, and the system creates that story like a loom,

26:03.400 --> 26:09.000
 and then it uses the contents of that story to inform its actions and writes the results

26:09.000 --> 26:11.280
 of that action into the story.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.400
 So how's that non illusion?

26:13.400 --> 26:21.320
 The story is written then, or a rather, we're not the writers of the story.

26:21.320 --> 26:24.120
 Yes, but we always knew that.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.440
 No, we don't know that.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.680
 When did we know that?

26:26.680 --> 26:29.320
 I think that's mostly a confusion about concepts.

26:29.320 --> 26:35.760
 The conceptual illusion in our culture comes from the idea that we live in physical reality,

26:35.760 --> 26:39.560
 and that we experience physical reality, and that we have ideas about it.

26:39.560 --> 26:45.080
 And then you have this dualist interpretation, where you have two substances, res extensor,

26:45.080 --> 26:49.880
 the world that you can touch, and that is made of extended things, and res cogitans,

26:49.880 --> 26:54.720
 which is the world of ideas, and in fact, both of them are mental representations.

26:54.720 --> 26:58.960
 One is the representations of the world as a game engine that your mind generates to

26:58.960 --> 27:03.520
 make sense of the perceptual data, and the other one, yes, that's what we perceive as

27:03.520 --> 27:04.520
 the physical world.

27:04.520 --> 27:07.200
 But we already know that the physical world is nothing like that, right?

27:07.200 --> 27:11.400
 But the mechanics is very different from what you and me perceive as the world.

27:11.400 --> 27:16.280
 The world that you and me perceive is a game engine, and there are no colors and sounds

27:16.280 --> 27:20.200
 in the physical world that only exist in the game engine generated by your brain.

27:20.200 --> 27:24.800
 And then you have ideas that cannot be mapped onto extended regions, right?

27:24.800 --> 27:29.680
 So the objects that have a spatial extension in the game engine, res extensor, and the

27:29.680 --> 27:34.680
 objects that don't have a physical extension in the game engine are ideas.

27:34.680 --> 27:38.680
 And they both interact in our mind to produce models of the world.

27:38.680 --> 27:45.640
 But when you play video games, I understand that what's actually happening is zeros and

27:45.640 --> 27:56.760
 ones inside of a computer, inside of a CPU and a GPU, but you're still seeing the rendering

27:56.760 --> 28:03.080
 of that, and you're still making decisions whether to shoot, to turn left or to turn

28:03.080 --> 28:07.440
 right if you're playing a shooter, or every time you start thinking about Skyrim and Elder

28:07.440 --> 28:11.040
 Scrolls and walking around in a beautiful nature and swinging a sword.

28:11.040 --> 28:15.720
 But it feels like you're making decisions inside that video game, so even though you

28:15.720 --> 28:23.080
 don't have direct access in terms of perception to the bits, to the zeros and ones, it still

28:23.080 --> 28:28.360
 feels like you're making decisions, and your decisions actually feels like they're being

28:28.360 --> 28:32.040
 applied all the way down to the zeros and ones.

28:32.040 --> 28:36.680
 So it feels like you have control, even though you don't direct access to reality.

28:36.680 --> 28:40.520
 So there is basically a special character in the video game that is being created by

28:40.520 --> 28:45.800
 the video game engine, and this character is serving the aesthetics of the video game,

28:45.800 --> 28:46.800
 and that is you.

28:46.800 --> 28:53.000
 Yes, but I feel like I have control inside the video game, like all those 12 year olds

28:53.000 --> 28:55.560
 that kick my ass on the internet.

28:55.560 --> 28:59.960
 So when you play the video game, it doesn't really matter that there's zeros and ones,

28:59.960 --> 29:03.640
 you don't care about the bits of the bus, you don't care about the nature of the CPU

29:03.640 --> 29:04.640
 that it runs on.

29:04.640 --> 29:08.200
 What you care about are the properties of the game that you're playing, and you hope

29:08.200 --> 29:10.560
 that the CPU is good enough.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.400
 And a similar thing happens when we interact with physics.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.080
 The world that you and me are in is not the physical world.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.720
 The world that you and me are in is a dream world.

29:19.720 --> 29:23.520
 How close is it to the real world, though?

29:23.520 --> 29:27.480
 We know that it's not very close, but we know that the dynamics of the dream world

29:27.480 --> 29:31.600
 match the dynamics of the physical world to a certain degree of resolution, but the causal

29:31.600 --> 29:35.320
 structure of the dream world is different.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.920
 So you see, for instance, waves crashing on your feet, right, but there are no waves

29:38.920 --> 29:39.920
 in the ocean.

29:39.920 --> 29:46.440
 There's only water molecules that have tangents between the molecules that are the result

29:46.440 --> 29:50.000
 of electrons in the molecules interacting with each other.

29:50.000 --> 29:56.080
 But aren't they very consistent where you're seeing a very crude approximation?

29:56.080 --> 30:02.080
 Aren't our dream world very consistent, like to the point of being mapped directly one

30:02.080 --> 30:07.880
 to one to the actual physical world as opposed to us being completely tricked?

30:07.880 --> 30:09.280
 This is like where you have like Donald Hock.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.280
 It's not a trick.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.280
 That's my point.

30:11.280 --> 30:12.280
 It's not an illusion.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.280
 It's a form of data compression.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.280
 Yeah.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.600
 It's an attempt to deal with the dynamics of too many parts to count at the level at

30:17.600 --> 30:20.520
 which we are entangled with the best model that you can find.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.520
 Yeah.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.760
 So we can act in that dream world.

30:22.760 --> 30:27.000
 And our actions have impact in the real world, in the physical world.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
 Yes.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
 To which we don't have access.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
 Yes.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.440
 But it's basically like accepting the fact that the software that we live in, the dream

30:33.440 --> 30:38.120
 that we live in is generated by something outside of this world that you and me are in.

30:38.120 --> 30:44.120
 So is the software deterministic and do we not have any control?

30:44.120 --> 30:49.720
 So free will is having a conscious being.

30:49.720 --> 30:53.800
 Free will is the monkey being able to steer the elephant.

30:53.800 --> 30:56.800
 No.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.800
 It's slightly different.

30:57.800 --> 31:02.960
 Basically, in the same way as you are modeling the water molecules in the ocean that engulf

31:02.960 --> 31:07.720
 your feet when you are walking on the beach as waves and there are no waves, but only

31:07.720 --> 31:11.960
 the atoms on more complicated stuff underneath the atoms and so on.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.120
 You know that, right?

31:14.120 --> 31:17.800
 You would accept, yes, there is a certain abstraction that happens here.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.400
 It's a simplification of what happens.

31:19.400 --> 31:24.760
 And a simplification that is designed in such a way that your brain can deal with it temporarily

31:24.760 --> 31:28.840
 and spatially in terms of resources and tuned for the predictive value.

31:28.840 --> 31:33.480
 So you can predict with some accuracy whether your feet are going to get wet or not.

31:33.480 --> 31:37.400
 But it's a really good, it's a really good interface and approximation.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.400
 Yes.

31:38.400 --> 31:43.080
 It's like E equals m t squared is a good, equations are good approximations for what

31:43.080 --> 31:45.920
 they're much better approximation.

31:45.920 --> 31:51.480
 So to me waves is a really nice approximation of what's all the complexity that's happening

31:51.480 --> 31:52.480
 underneath.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.480
 Yes.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.680
 Basically, it's a machine learning model that is constantly tuned to minimize surprises.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.760
 So it basically tries to predict as well as it can what you're going to perceive next.

31:59.760 --> 32:04.680
 Are we talking about which is the machine learning, our perception system or the dream

32:04.680 --> 32:05.680
 world?

32:05.680 --> 32:11.280
 The dream world is the result of the machine learning process of the perception system.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.280
 That's doing the compression.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.280
 Yes.

32:14.280 --> 32:19.200
 So the model of you as an agent is not a different type of model or it's a different

32:19.200 --> 32:25.720
 type but not different as in its model like nature from the model of the ocean.

32:25.720 --> 32:28.520
 Some things are oceans, some things are agents.

32:28.520 --> 32:32.880
 And one of these agents is using your own control model, the output of your model, the

32:32.880 --> 32:36.520
 things that you perceive yourself as doing.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.400
 And that is you.

32:38.400 --> 32:46.440
 What about the fact that when you're standing with the water on your feet and you're looking

32:46.440 --> 32:55.560
 out into the vast open water of the ocean and then there's a beautiful sunset and the

32:55.560 --> 32:59.600
 fact that it's beautiful and then maybe you have friends or loved one with you and you

32:59.600 --> 33:00.600
 feel love.

33:00.600 --> 33:01.600
 What is that?

33:01.600 --> 33:02.600
 As the dream world?

33:02.600 --> 33:03.600
 What is that?

33:03.600 --> 33:04.600
 Yes.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.600
 It's all happening inside of the dream.

33:06.600 --> 33:07.600
 Okay.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.800
 You see, the word dream makes it seem like it's not real.

33:10.800 --> 33:15.160
 Of course, it's not real.

33:15.160 --> 33:19.080
 The physical universe is real but the physical universe is incomprehensible and it doesn't

33:19.080 --> 33:21.120
 have any feeling of realness.

33:21.120 --> 33:25.520
 The feeling of realness that you experience gets attached to certain representations where

33:25.520 --> 33:28.600
 your brain assesses this is the best model of reality that I have.

33:28.600 --> 33:34.000
 So the only thing that's real to you is the thing that's happening at the very base of

33:34.000 --> 33:36.800
 reality like the…

33:36.800 --> 33:40.160
 For something to be real, it needs to be implemented.

33:40.160 --> 33:45.520
 So the model that you have of reality is real in as far as it is a model.

33:45.520 --> 33:49.760
 It's an appropriate description of the world to say that there are models that are being

33:49.760 --> 33:56.440
 experienced but the world that you experience is not necessarily implemented.

33:56.440 --> 34:02.280
 There is a difference between a reality, a simulation and a simulacrum.

34:02.280 --> 34:07.320
 The reality that we're talking about is something that fully emerges over a causally

34:07.320 --> 34:08.800
 closed lowest layer.

34:08.800 --> 34:12.680
 The idea of physicalism is that we are in that layer, that basically our world emerges

34:12.680 --> 34:13.680
 over that.

34:13.680 --> 34:18.040
 Every alternative to physicalism is a simulation theory which basically says that we are in

34:18.040 --> 34:21.560
 some kind of simulation universe and the real world needs to be an apparent universe of

34:21.560 --> 34:24.600
 that where the actual causal structure is.

34:24.600 --> 34:29.000
 And when you look at the ocean in your own mind, you are looking at a simulation that

34:29.000 --> 34:30.920
 explains what you're going to see next.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.960
 So we are living in a simulation.

34:32.960 --> 34:36.400
 Yes, but a simulation generated by our own brains.

34:36.400 --> 34:40.920
 And this simulation is different from the physical reality because the causal structure

34:40.920 --> 34:44.640
 that is being produced, what you are seeing is different from the causal structure of

34:44.640 --> 34:45.640
 physics.

34:45.640 --> 34:46.640
 But consistent.

34:46.640 --> 34:47.640
 Hopefully.

34:47.640 --> 34:51.680
 If not, then you are going to end up in some kind of institution where people will take

34:51.680 --> 34:54.720
 care of you because your behavior will be inconsistent.

34:54.720 --> 34:59.600
 Your behavior needs to work in such a way that it's interacting with an accurately

34:59.600 --> 35:05.440
 predictive model of reality and if your brain is unable to make your model of reality predictive,

35:05.440 --> 35:06.440
 you will need help.

35:06.440 --> 35:12.720
 So what do you think about Donald Hoffman's argument that it doesn't have to be consistent

35:12.720 --> 35:19.520
 the dream world to what he calls like the interface to the actual physical reality

35:19.520 --> 35:24.280
 where there could be, I think he makes an evolutionary argument, which is like it could

35:24.280 --> 35:30.960
 be an evolutionary advantage to have the dream world drift away from physical reality.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.920
 I think that only works if you have tenure.

35:32.920 --> 35:37.600
 As long as you're still interacting with the ground tools, your model needs to be somewhat

35:37.600 --> 35:38.600
 predictive.

35:38.600 --> 35:44.040
 Well, in some sense, humans have achieved a kind of tenure in the animal kingdom.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.040
 Yeah.

35:45.040 --> 35:49.560
 At some point, we became too big to fail, so we became postmodernist.

35:49.560 --> 35:55.480
 It all makes sense now, the version of reality that we like.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.480
 Oh man.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.480
 Okay.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.320
 Yeah, but basically, you can do magic.

36:00.320 --> 36:04.960
 You can change your assessment of reality, but eventually, reality is going to come bite

36:04.960 --> 36:06.400
 you in the ass if it's not predictive.

36:06.400 --> 36:12.680
 Do you have a sense of what is that base layer of physical reality?

36:12.680 --> 36:20.000
 You have these attempts at the theories of everything, the very, very small of like string

36:20.000 --> 36:26.360
 theory or what Stephen Wolfram talks about with the hypergrass, these are these tiny,

36:26.360 --> 36:33.120
 tiny, tiny, tiny objects, and then there is more like quantum mechanics that's talking

36:33.120 --> 36:36.480
 about objects that are much larger, but still very, very, very tiny.

36:36.480 --> 36:43.320
 Do you have a sense of where the tiniest thing is that is like at the lowest level, the turtle

36:43.320 --> 36:44.320
 at the very bottom?

36:44.320 --> 36:45.320
 Do you have a sense?

36:45.320 --> 36:50.720
 I don't think that you can talk about where it is because space is emergent over the activity

36:50.720 --> 36:51.720
 of these things.

36:51.720 --> 36:58.920
 So coordinates only exist in relation to the things, other things.

36:58.920 --> 37:02.880
 And so you could, in some sense, abstract it into locations that can hold information

37:02.880 --> 37:06.760
 and trajectories that the information can take between the different locations.

37:06.760 --> 37:10.560
 And this is how we construct our notion of space.

37:10.560 --> 37:15.920
 And physicists usually have a notion of space that is continuous.

37:15.920 --> 37:21.400
 And this is a point where I tend to agree with people like Stephen Wolfram, who are very

37:21.400 --> 37:23.800
 skeptical of the geometric notions.

37:23.800 --> 37:27.440
 I think that geometry is the dynamics of too many parts to count.

37:27.440 --> 37:32.840
 And when there are no infinities, if there were two infinities, you would be able to

37:32.840 --> 37:37.720
 be running into contradictions, which is, in some sense, what Gödel and Turing discovered

37:37.720 --> 37:39.880
 in response to Hilbert's call.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.400
 So there are no infinities.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.400
 There are no infinities.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.120
 There is unboundedness.

37:44.120 --> 37:47.920
 But if you have a language that talks about infinity, at some point, the language is going

37:47.920 --> 37:51.840
 to contradict itself, which means it's no longer valid.

37:51.840 --> 37:57.640
 In order to deal with infinities and mathematics, you have to postulate the existence initially.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.280
 You cannot construct the infinities.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.280
 And that's an issue, right?

38:00.280 --> 38:02.840
 You cannot build up an infinity from zero.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.760
 But in practice, you never do this, right?

38:04.760 --> 38:09.280
 When you perform calculations, you only look at the dynamics of too many parts to count.

38:09.280 --> 38:13.520
 And usually, these numbers are not that large.

38:13.520 --> 38:16.120
 They're not Googles or something.

38:16.120 --> 38:20.600
 The infinities that we are dealing with in our universe are, mathematically speaking,

38:20.600 --> 38:23.360
 relatively small integers.

38:23.360 --> 38:31.280
 And still, what we're looking at is dynamics where a trillion things behave similar to

38:31.280 --> 38:39.320
 a hundred trillion things or something that is very, very large, because they're converging.

38:39.320 --> 38:43.480
 And these converging dynamics, these operators, this is what we deal with when we are doing

38:43.480 --> 38:44.480
 the geometry.

38:44.480 --> 38:45.480
 Right?

38:45.480 --> 38:50.320
 The geometry is stuff where we can pretend that it's continuous, because if we subdivide

38:50.320 --> 38:56.240
 the space sufficiently fine grained, these things approach a certain dynamic.

38:56.240 --> 38:59.360
 And this approached dynamic, that is what we mean by it.

38:59.360 --> 39:04.280
 But I don't think that infinity would work, so to speak, that you would know the last

39:04.280 --> 39:09.080
 digit of pi and that you have a physical process that rests on knowing the last digit of pi.

39:09.080 --> 39:15.200
 Yeah, that could be just a peculiar quirk of human cognition that we like discrete.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.120
 Discrete makes sense to us.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.120
 Infinity doesn't.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.600
 So in terms of our intuitions.

39:19.600 --> 39:24.160
 No, the issue is that everything that we think about needs to be expressed in some

39:24.160 --> 39:29.320
 kind of mental language, not necessarily a natural language, but some kind of mathematical

39:29.320 --> 39:34.320
 language that your neurons can speak, that refers to something in the world.

39:34.320 --> 39:39.520
 And what we have discovered is that we cannot construct a notion of infinity without running

39:39.520 --> 39:43.760
 into contradictions, which means that such a language is no longer valid.

39:43.760 --> 39:48.080
 And I suspect this is what made Pythagoras so unhappy when somebody came up with the

39:48.080 --> 39:51.680
 notion of irrational numbers before it was time, where there's this myth that he had

39:51.680 --> 39:55.640
 this person killed when he blabbed out the secret that not everything can be expressed

39:55.640 --> 39:59.760
 as a ratio between two numbers, but that there are numbers between the ratios.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.080
 The world was not ready for this.

40:01.080 --> 40:06.720
 And I think he was right that has confused mathematicians very seriously because these

40:06.720 --> 40:09.800
 numbers are not values, they are functions.

40:09.800 --> 40:13.440
 And so you can calculate these functions to a certain degree of approximation, but you

40:13.440 --> 40:17.120
 cannot pretend that pi has actually a value.

40:17.120 --> 40:21.600
 Pi is a function that would approach this value to some degree.

40:21.600 --> 40:26.400
 But nothing in the world rests on knowing pi.

40:26.400 --> 40:31.840
 How important is this distinction between discrete and continuous for you to get to

40:31.840 --> 40:32.840
 the point?

40:32.840 --> 40:39.320
 Because there's a, I mean, in discussion of your favorite flavor of the theory of everything,

40:39.320 --> 40:41.240
 there's a few on the table.

40:41.240 --> 40:49.080
 So there's string theory, there's a particular, there's a loop quantum gravity, which focus

40:49.080 --> 40:54.160
 on one particular unification.

40:54.160 --> 40:59.720
 There's just a bunch of favorite flavors of different people trying to propose a theory

40:59.720 --> 41:01.360
 of everything.

41:01.360 --> 41:04.880
 Eric Weinstein and a bunch of people throughout history.

41:04.880 --> 41:09.840
 And then of course, Stephen Wolfram, who I think is one of the only people doing a discrete

41:09.840 --> 41:10.840
 theory.

41:10.840 --> 41:11.840
 No, no.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.840
 There's a bunch of physicists who do this right now.

41:13.840 --> 41:22.840
 And like Tofoli and Tomasello and digital physics is something that is, I think, growing

41:22.840 --> 41:24.600
 in popularity.

41:24.600 --> 41:34.560
 But the main reason why this is interesting is because it is important sometimes to settle

41:34.560 --> 41:35.560
 disagreements.

41:35.560 --> 41:39.880
 I don't think that you need infinities at all and you never needed them.

41:39.880 --> 41:43.200
 You can always deal with very large numbers and you can deal with limits, right?

41:43.200 --> 41:44.680
 We are fine with doing that.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.200
 You don't need any kind of affinity.

41:46.200 --> 41:50.400
 You can build your computer algebra systems just as well without believing in infinity

41:50.400 --> 41:51.400
 in the first place.

41:51.400 --> 41:52.560
 So you're okay with limits?

41:52.560 --> 41:53.560
 Yeah.

41:53.560 --> 41:58.800
 So basically a limit means that something is behaving pretty much the same if you make

41:58.800 --> 42:00.840
 the number larger, right?

42:00.840 --> 42:04.040
 Because it's converging to a certain value and at some point the difference becomes

42:04.040 --> 42:06.760
 negligible and you can no longer measure it.

42:06.760 --> 42:12.920
 And in this sense, you have things that if you have an n gone, which has enough corners,

42:12.920 --> 42:15.360
 then it's going to behave like a circle at some point, right?

42:15.360 --> 42:20.160
 And it's only going to be in some kind of esoteric thing that cannot exist in a physical

42:20.160 --> 42:23.960
 universe that you would be talking about this perfect circle.

42:23.960 --> 42:27.800
 And now it turns out that it also wouldn't work in mathematics because you cannot construct

42:27.800 --> 42:32.960
 mathematics that has infinite resolution without running into contradictions.

42:32.960 --> 42:36.320
 So that is itself not that important because we never did that, right?

42:36.320 --> 42:39.160
 It's just a thing that some people thought we could.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.880
 And this leads to confusion.

42:40.880 --> 42:45.280
 So for instance, Roger Penrose uses this as an argument to say that there are certain

42:45.280 --> 42:50.720
 things that mathematicians can do dealing with infinities.

42:50.720 --> 42:55.080
 And by extension, our mind can do that computers cannot do.

42:55.080 --> 42:56.080
 Yeah.

42:56.080 --> 43:01.320
 He talks about that there's the human mind can do certain mathematical things that the

43:01.320 --> 43:05.920
 computer has defined by the universal towing machine cannot.

43:05.920 --> 43:06.920
 Yes.

43:06.920 --> 43:07.920
 What?

43:07.920 --> 43:08.920
 So that it has to do with infinity.

43:08.920 --> 43:09.920
 Yes.

43:09.920 --> 43:10.920
 It's one of the things.

43:10.920 --> 43:19.040
 So he is basically pointing at the fact that there are things that are possible in the

43:19.040 --> 43:24.360
 mathematical mind and in pure mathematics that are not possible in machines that can

43:24.360 --> 43:27.360
 be constructed in the physical universe.

43:27.360 --> 43:32.960
 And because he's an honest guy, he thinks this means that present physics cannot explain

43:32.960 --> 43:35.000
 operations that happen in our mind.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
 Do you think he's right?

43:37.000 --> 43:40.560
 So let's leave his discussion of consciousness aside for the moment.

43:40.560 --> 43:46.240
 Do you think he's right about just what he's basically referring to as intelligence?

43:46.240 --> 43:53.320
 So is the human mind fundamentally more capable as a thinking machine than a universal towing

43:53.320 --> 43:54.320
 machine?

43:54.320 --> 43:55.320
 No.

43:55.320 --> 43:58.880
 But so he's suggesting that, right?

43:58.880 --> 44:01.080
 So our mind is actually less than a towing machine.

44:01.080 --> 44:05.400
 There can be no towing machine because it's defined as having an infinite tape.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.240
 And we always only have a finite tape.

44:07.240 --> 44:08.240
 But he's saying it's better.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.760
 Our minds can only perform finitely many operations.

44:09.760 --> 44:14.640
 But he's saying it can do the kind of computation that the towing machine cannot.

44:14.640 --> 44:19.440
 And that's because he thinks that our minds can do operations that have infinite resolution

44:19.440 --> 44:21.280
 in some sense.

44:21.280 --> 44:23.400
 And I don't think that's the case.

44:23.400 --> 44:30.440
 Our minds are just able to discover these limit operators over too many parts to count.

44:30.440 --> 44:37.560
 What about his idea that consciousness is more than a computation?

44:37.560 --> 44:42.200
 So it's more than something that a towing machine can do.

44:42.200 --> 44:47.080
 So again, saying that there's something special about our mind that cannot be replicated in

44:47.080 --> 44:48.080
 the machine.

44:48.080 --> 44:55.200
 The issue is that I don't even know how to construct a language to express this statement

44:55.200 --> 44:56.200
 correctly.

44:56.200 --> 45:08.320
 Well, the basic statement is there's a human experience that includes intelligence, that

45:08.320 --> 45:13.080
 includes self awareness, that includes the hard problem of consciousness.

45:13.080 --> 45:20.160
 And the question is, can that be fully simulated in the computer, in the mathematical model

45:20.160 --> 45:23.840
 of the computer, as we understand it today?

45:23.840 --> 45:26.040
 As your parenthesis, no.

45:26.040 --> 45:32.600
 So the universal towing machine cannot simulate the universe.

45:32.600 --> 45:36.600
 So the interesting question is, and you have to ask him this, is why not?

45:36.600 --> 45:40.120
 What is the specific thing that cannot be modeled?

45:40.120 --> 45:46.000
 And when I looked at his writings, and I haven't read all of it, but when I read, for instance,

45:46.000 --> 45:52.280
 the section that he writes in the introduction and wrote to infinity, the thing that he specifically

45:52.280 --> 45:57.960
 refers to is the way in which human minds deal with infinities.

45:57.960 --> 46:03.040
 And that itself can, I think, easily be deconstructed.

46:03.040 --> 46:08.800
 A lot of people feel that our experience cannot be explained in a mechanical way.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.400
 And therefore, it needs to be different.

46:11.400 --> 46:14.680
 And I concur, our experience is not mechanical.

46:14.680 --> 46:16.800
 Our experience is simulated.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.360
 It exists only in a simulation.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.280
 The only simulation can be conscious.

46:20.280 --> 46:23.280
 Physical systems cannot be conscious because they're only mechanical.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.360
 Cells cannot be conscious.

46:25.360 --> 46:26.520
 Neurons cannot be conscious.

46:26.520 --> 46:27.680
 Brains cannot be conscious.

46:27.680 --> 46:32.040
 People cannot be conscious as far as you, if you understand them as physical systems.

46:32.040 --> 46:37.960
 What can be conscious is the story of a system in the world where you write all these things

46:37.960 --> 46:39.480
 into the story.

46:39.480 --> 46:43.520
 You have experiences for the same reason that a character and novel have experiences, because

46:43.520 --> 46:45.880
 it's written into the story.

46:45.880 --> 46:48.280
 And now the system is acting on that story.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.680
 And it's not a story that is written in a natural language.

46:50.680 --> 46:55.560
 It's written in a perceptual language, in this multimedia language of the game engine.

46:55.560 --> 47:00.800
 And in there, you write in what kind of experience you have and what this means for the behavior

47:00.800 --> 47:04.520
 of the system, for your behavior tendencies, for your focus, for your attention, for your

47:04.520 --> 47:06.560
 experience of valence, and so on.

47:06.560 --> 47:10.840
 And this is being used to inform the behavior of the system in the next step.

47:10.840 --> 47:16.960
 And then the story updates with the reactions of the system and the changes in the world,

47:16.960 --> 47:17.960
 and so on.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.400
 And you live inside of that model.

47:19.400 --> 47:23.680
 You don't live inside of the physical reality.

47:23.680 --> 47:30.920
 And I mean, just to linger on it, like, you see, okay, it's in the perceptual language,

47:30.920 --> 47:35.080
 the multimodal perceptual language, that's the experience.

47:35.080 --> 47:41.040
 That's what consciousness is within that model, within that story.

47:41.040 --> 47:43.120
 But do you have agency?

47:43.120 --> 47:49.720
 When you play a video game, you can turn left and you can turn right in that story.

47:49.720 --> 47:54.320
 So in that dream world, how much control do you have?

47:54.320 --> 47:57.760
 Is there such a thing as you in that story?

47:57.760 --> 48:02.920
 Like is it right to say the main character, you know, everybody's NPCs, and then there's

48:02.920 --> 48:07.120
 the main character, and you're controlling the main character?

48:07.120 --> 48:08.760
 Or is that an illusion?

48:08.760 --> 48:10.840
 Is there a main character that you're controlling?

48:10.840 --> 48:14.920
 I'm getting to the point of, like, the free will point.

48:14.920 --> 48:18.000
 Imagine that you are building a robot that plays soccer.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.160
 And you've been to MIT computer science, you basically know how to do that.

48:22.160 --> 48:28.200
 And so you would say the robot is an agent that solves a control problem, how to get

48:28.200 --> 48:29.200
 the ball into the goal.

48:29.200 --> 48:33.320
 And it needs to perceive the world and the world is disturbing him in trying to do this.

48:33.320 --> 48:37.360
 So he has to control many variables to make that happen and to project itself and the

48:37.360 --> 48:42.040
 ball into the future and understand its position on the field relative to the ball and so on

48:42.040 --> 48:47.000
 in the position of its limbs or in the space around it and so on.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.600
 So it needs to have an adequate model that abstracting reality in a useful way.

48:51.600 --> 48:58.600
 And you could say that this robot does have agency over what it's doing in some sense.

48:58.600 --> 49:01.560
 And the model is going to be a control model.

49:01.560 --> 49:06.280
 And inside of that control model, you can possibly get to a point where this thing is

49:06.280 --> 49:09.600
 sufficiently abstract to discover its own agency.

49:09.600 --> 49:10.880
 Our current robots don't do that.

49:10.880 --> 49:13.280
 They don't have a unified model of the universe.

49:13.280 --> 49:17.240
 But there's not a reason why we shouldn't be getting there at some point in the not

49:17.240 --> 49:18.720
 too distant future.

49:18.720 --> 49:25.000
 And once that happens, you will notice that the robot tells a story about a robot playing

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
 soccer.

49:26.000 --> 49:31.400
 So the robot will experience itself playing soccer in a simulation of the world that it

49:31.400 --> 49:38.080
 uses to construct a model of the locations of its legs and limbs in space on the field

49:38.080 --> 49:39.320
 with relationship to the ball.

49:39.320 --> 49:42.280
 And it's not going to be at the level of the molecules.

49:42.280 --> 49:46.680
 It will be an abstraction that is exactly at the level that is most suitable for past

49:46.680 --> 49:49.960
 planning of the movements of the robot.

49:49.960 --> 49:53.600
 It's going to be a high level abstraction, but a very useful one that is as predictive

49:53.600 --> 49:55.200
 as we can make it.

49:55.200 --> 49:58.760
 And in that side of that story, there is a model of the agency of that system.

49:58.760 --> 50:05.920
 So the model can accurately predict that the contents of the model are going to be driving

50:05.920 --> 50:08.920
 the behavior of the robot in the immediate future.

50:08.920 --> 50:16.040
 But there's the hard problem of consciousness, which I would also, there's a subjective experience

50:16.040 --> 50:22.000
 of free will as well, that I'm not sure where the robot gets that, where that little leap

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
 is.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.080
 Because for me right now, everything I imagine with that robot as it gets more and more and

50:27.080 --> 50:34.120
 more sophisticated, the agency comes from the programmer of the robot still, of what

50:34.120 --> 50:35.360
 was programmed in.

50:35.360 --> 50:38.520
 You would probably do an end to end learning system.

50:38.520 --> 50:42.400
 You maybe need to give it a few priors, so you nudge the architecture in the right direction

50:42.400 --> 50:44.480
 that it converges more quickly.

50:44.480 --> 50:49.560
 But ultimately, discovering the suitable hyperparameters of the architecture is also only a search

50:49.560 --> 50:50.560
 process, right?

50:50.560 --> 50:55.600
 And as the search process was evolution that has informed our brain architecture so we

50:55.600 --> 51:00.120
 can converge in a single lifetime on useful interaction with the world and the formation

51:00.120 --> 51:01.120
 of a circle.

51:01.120 --> 51:06.280
 The problem is if we define hyperparameters broadly, so it's not just the parameters that

51:06.280 --> 51:13.520
 control this end to end learning system, but the entirety of the design of the robot.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.880
 You have to remove the human completely from the picture.

51:15.880 --> 51:21.440
 And then in order to build the robot, you have to create an entire universe because you can't

51:21.440 --> 51:22.440
 just shortcut evolution.

51:22.440 --> 51:24.720
 You have to go from the very beginning.

51:24.720 --> 51:30.720
 In order for it to have, because I feel like there's always a human pulling the strings

51:30.720 --> 51:34.000
 and that makes it seem like the robot is cheating.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.080
 It's getting a shortcut to consciousness.

51:36.080 --> 51:38.320
 And you are looking at the current Boston Dynamics robots.

51:38.320 --> 51:40.920
 It doesn't look as if there is somebody pulling the strings.

51:40.920 --> 51:42.440
 It doesn't look like cheating anymore.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.960
 Okay, so let's go there because I got to talk to you about this.

51:44.960 --> 51:52.000
 So obviously with the case of Boston Dynamics, as you may or may not know, it's always either

51:52.000 --> 51:54.200
 hard coded or remote controlled.

51:54.200 --> 51:55.200
 There's no intelligence.

51:55.200 --> 52:00.040
 So I don't know how the current generation of Boston Dynamics robots works, but what

52:00.040 --> 52:05.320
 I've been told about the previous ones was that it's basically all cybernetic control,

52:05.320 --> 52:08.760
 which means you still have feedback mechanisms and so on.

52:08.760 --> 52:14.160
 But it's not deep learning for the most part as it's currently done.

52:14.160 --> 52:19.360
 For the most part, just identifying a control hierarchy that is congruent to the limbs that

52:19.360 --> 52:22.680
 exist and the parameters that need to be optimized for the movement of these limbs.

52:22.680 --> 52:24.640
 And then there is a convergence progress.

52:24.640 --> 52:28.000
 So it's basically just regression that you would need to control this.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.560
 But again, I don't know whether that's true.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.480
 That's just what I've been told about how they work.

52:31.480 --> 52:35.120
 We have to separate several levels of discussions here.

52:35.120 --> 52:41.240
 So the only thing they do is pretty sophisticated control with no machine learning in order

52:41.240 --> 52:46.120
 to maintain balance or to write itself.

52:46.120 --> 52:51.480
 It's a control problem in terms of using the actuators to when it's pushed or when it steps

52:51.480 --> 52:55.440
 on a thing that's uneven, how to always maintain balance.

52:55.440 --> 53:00.880
 And there's a tricky heuristics around that, but that's the only goal.

53:00.880 --> 53:06.200
 Everything you see Boston Dynamics doing in terms of that to us humans is compelling,

53:06.200 --> 53:16.120
 which is any kind of higher order movement like turning, wiggling its butt, jumping back

53:16.120 --> 53:22.600
 on its two feet, dancing, dancing is even worse because dancing is hard coded in.

53:22.600 --> 53:25.320
 It's it's choreographed by humans.

53:25.320 --> 53:31.040
 There's choreography software, like there is no of all that high level movement.

53:31.040 --> 53:38.880
 There's no anything that you can call certainly can't call AI, but there's no even like basic

53:38.880 --> 53:39.880
 heuristics.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.240
 It's all hard coded in.

53:41.240 --> 53:48.960
 And yet we humans immediately project agency onto them, which is this is fast.

53:48.960 --> 53:53.280
 So the gap here is it doesn't necessarily have agency.

53:53.280 --> 53:55.440
 What it has is cybernetic control.

53:55.440 --> 53:59.120
 And the cybernetic control means you have a hierarchy of feedback loops that keep the

53:59.120 --> 54:03.480
 behavior in certain boundaries so the robot doesn't fall over and it's able to perform

54:03.480 --> 54:08.600
 the movements and the choreography cannot really happen with motion capture because the robot

54:08.600 --> 54:11.920
 would fall over because the physics of the robot, the weight distribution and so on is

54:11.920 --> 54:15.480
 different from the weight distribution in the human body.

54:15.480 --> 54:20.760
 So if you were using the directly motion captured movements of a human body to project

54:20.760 --> 54:22.640
 it into this robot, it wouldn't work.

54:22.640 --> 54:26.280
 You can do this with a computer animation that will look a little bit off, but who cares?

54:26.280 --> 54:31.680
 But if you want to correct for the physics, you need to basically tell the robot where

54:31.680 --> 54:33.880
 it should move its limbs.

54:33.880 --> 54:38.880
 And then the control algorithm is going to approximate a solution that makes it possible

54:38.880 --> 54:41.160
 visit the physics of the robot.

54:41.160 --> 54:44.840
 And you have to find the basic solution for making that happen.

54:44.840 --> 54:50.320
 And there's probably going to be some regression necessary to get the control architecture to

54:50.320 --> 54:51.320
 make these movements.

54:51.320 --> 54:52.920
 But those two layers are separate.

54:52.920 --> 54:53.920
 Yes.

54:53.920 --> 54:58.240
 The thing, the higher level instruction of how you should move and where you should

54:58.240 --> 54:59.720
 move is a high level.

54:59.720 --> 55:03.720
 I expect that the control level of these robots at some level is dumb.

55:03.720 --> 55:07.960
 Because it's just the physical control movement, the motor architecture.

55:07.960 --> 55:10.240
 But it's a relatively smart motor architecture.

55:10.240 --> 55:14.720
 It's just that there is no high level deliberation about what decisions to make necessarily.

55:14.720 --> 55:18.560
 But it doesn't feel like free will or consciousness.

55:18.560 --> 55:20.560
 That was not where I was trying to get to.

55:20.560 --> 55:24.660
 I think that in our own body, we have that too.

55:24.660 --> 55:29.640
 So we have a certain thing that is basically just a cybernetic control architecture that

55:29.640 --> 55:31.600
 is moving our limbs.

55:31.600 --> 55:35.880
 And deep learning can help in discovering such an architecture if you don't have it

55:35.880 --> 55:37.320
 in the first place.

55:37.320 --> 55:40.800
 If you already know your hardware, you can maybe handcraft it.

55:40.800 --> 55:43.840
 But if you don't know your hardware, you can search for such an architecture.

55:43.840 --> 55:47.240
 And this work already existed in the 80s and 90s.

55:47.240 --> 55:51.080
 People were starting to search for control architectures by motor babbling and so on

55:51.080 --> 55:55.880
 and just use reinforcement learning architectures to discover such a thing.

55:55.880 --> 56:01.480
 And now imagine that you have the cybernetic control architecture already inside of you.

56:01.480 --> 56:03.840
 And you extend this a little bit.

56:03.840 --> 56:08.480
 So you are seeking output, for instance, or rest or and so on.

56:08.480 --> 56:12.080
 And you get to have a baby at some point.

56:12.080 --> 56:15.840
 And now you add more and more control layers to this.

56:15.840 --> 56:20.280
 And the system is reverse engineering its own control architecture and builds a high

56:20.280 --> 56:26.440
 level model to synchronize the pursuit of very different conflicting goals.

56:26.440 --> 56:28.560
 And this is how I think you get to purposes.

56:28.560 --> 56:30.120
 Purposes are models of your goals.

56:30.120 --> 56:33.920
 The goals might be intrinsic as the result of the different set point violations that

56:33.920 --> 56:39.120
 you have, hunger and thirst for very different things and rest and pain avoidance and so

56:39.120 --> 56:40.120
 on.

56:40.120 --> 56:44.040
 And you put all these things together and eventually you need to come up with a strategy

56:44.040 --> 56:46.200
 to synchronize them all.

56:46.200 --> 56:51.440
 And you don't need just to do this alone by yourself because you are state building organisms.

56:51.440 --> 56:55.960
 We cannot function as an isolation the way that homo sapiens is set up.

56:55.960 --> 57:01.520
 So our own behavior only makes sense when you zoom out very far into a society or even

57:01.520 --> 57:06.600
 into ecosystemic intelligence on the planet and our place in it.

57:06.600 --> 57:10.120
 So the individual behavior only makes sense in these larger contexts.

57:10.120 --> 57:11.880
 And we have a number of priors built into us.

57:11.880 --> 57:16.600
 So we are behaving as if we were acting on these high level goals pretty much right from

57:16.600 --> 57:18.160
 the start.

57:18.160 --> 57:22.040
 And eventually in the course of our life, we can reverse engineer the goals that we

57:22.040 --> 57:25.920
 are acting on what actually are our higher level purposes.

57:25.920 --> 57:28.760
 And the more we understand that, the more our behavior makes sense.

57:28.760 --> 57:34.280
 But this is all at this point, complex stories within stories that are driving our behavior.

57:34.280 --> 57:41.240
 Yeah, I just don't know how big of a leap it is to start creating a system that's able

57:41.240 --> 57:46.880
 to tell stories within stories, like how big of a leap that is from where currently Boston

57:46.880 --> 57:54.000
 Dynamics is or any robot that's operating in the physical space.

57:54.000 --> 57:59.440
 And that leap might be big if it requires to solve the hard problem of consciousness,

57:59.440 --> 58:01.560
 which is telling a hell of a good story.

58:01.560 --> 58:05.320
 I suspect that consciousness itself is relatively simple.

58:05.320 --> 58:10.000
 What's hard is perception and the interface between perception and reasoning.

58:10.000 --> 58:16.200
 There's, for instance, the idea of the consciousness prior that would be built into such a system

58:16.200 --> 58:26.680
 by Yoshua Bengio, and what he describes, and I think that's accurate, is that our own model

58:26.680 --> 58:29.840
 of the world can be described through something like an energy function.

58:29.840 --> 58:34.880
 The energy function is modeling the contradictions that exist within the model at any given point.

58:34.880 --> 58:38.480
 And you try to minimize these contradictions, the tangents in the model.

58:38.480 --> 58:41.440
 And to do this, you need to sometimes test things.

58:41.440 --> 58:43.800
 You need to conditionally disambiguate figure and ground.

58:43.800 --> 58:47.640
 You need to distinguish whether this is true or that is true.

58:47.640 --> 58:48.640
 And so on.

58:48.640 --> 58:51.920
 Eventually, you get to an interpretation, but you will need to manually depress a few

58:51.920 --> 58:55.720
 points in your model to let it snap into a state that makes sense.

58:55.720 --> 58:59.960
 And this function that tries to get the biggest dip in the energy function in your model according

58:59.960 --> 59:02.480
 to Yoshua Bengio is related to consciousness.

59:02.480 --> 59:07.680
 It's a low dimensional discrete function that tries to maximize this dip in the energy

59:07.680 --> 59:08.680
 function.

59:08.680 --> 59:15.480
 Yeah, I think I would need to dig into details because I think the way he uses the word consciousness

59:15.480 --> 59:21.560
 is more akin to self awareness, like modeling yourself within the world as opposed to the

59:21.560 --> 59:23.760
 subjective experience, the hard problem.

59:23.760 --> 59:26.600
 No, it's not even the self within the world.

59:26.600 --> 59:31.160
 The self is the agent and you don't need to be aware of yourself in order to be conscious.

59:31.160 --> 59:35.600
 The self is just a particular content that you can have, but you don't have to have.

59:35.600 --> 59:41.200
 But you can be conscious in, for instance, a dream at night or during a meditation state

59:41.200 --> 59:45.720
 where you don't have a self, where you're just aware of the fact that you are aware.

59:45.720 --> 59:53.800
 And what we mean by consciousness and colloquial sense is largely this reflexive self awareness

59:53.800 --> 59:58.160
 that we become aware of the fact that you're paying attention, that we are the thing that

59:58.160 --> 59:59.360
 pays attention.

59:59.360 --> 1:00:01.040
 We are the thing that pays attention.

1:00:01.040 --> 1:00:02.040
 Right.

1:00:02.040 --> 1:00:08.520
 I don't see the awareness that we're aware.

1:00:08.520 --> 1:00:12.600
 The hard problem doesn't feel like it's solved.

1:00:12.600 --> 1:00:18.760
 It's called a hard problem for a reason because it seems like there needs to be a major leap.

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:25.360
 Yeah, I think the major leap is to understand how it is possible that a machine can dream,

1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:30.440
 that a physical system is able to create a representation that the physical system is

1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:34.080
 acting on and that is spun force and so on.

1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:37.880
 But once you accept the fact that you are not in physics, but that you exist inside

1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:40.960
 of the story, I think the mystery disappears.

1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:42.360
 Everything is possible in a story.

1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:43.360
 Exist inside the story.

1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:44.360
 Okay.

1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:45.840
 Your consciousness is being written into the story.

1:00:45.840 --> 1:00:48.880
 The fact that you experience things is written to the story.

1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:51.400
 You ask yourself, is this real what I'm seeing?

1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:53.920
 And your brain writes into the story, yes, it's real.

1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:56.360
 So what about the perception of consciousness?

1:00:56.360 --> 1:00:59.640
 So to me, you look conscious.

1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:07.800
 So the illusion of consciousness, the demonstration of consciousness, I ask for the legged robot,

1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:10.720
 how do we make this legged robot conscious?

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:16.600
 So there's two things that maybe you can tell me if they're neighboring ideas.

1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:22.680
 One is actually making conscious and the other is make it appear conscious to others.

1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:25.840
 Are those related?

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:27.520
 Let's ask it from the other direction.

1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:31.280
 What would it take to make you not conscious?

1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:38.320
 So when you are thinking about how you perceive the world, can you decide to switch from looking

1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:43.160
 at qualia to looking at representational states?

1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:44.280
 And it turns out you can.

1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:45.280
 Yeah.

1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:49.480
 There is a particular way in which you can look at the world and recognize its machine

1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:51.600
 nature, including your own.

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:56.000
 And in that state, you don't have that conscious experience in this way anymore.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.000
 It becomes apparent as a representation.

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.800
 Everything becomes opaque.

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:06.120
 And I think this thing that you recognize everything as a representation, this is typically

1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:09.320
 what we mean with enlightenment states.

1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:14.440
 And it can happen on the motivational level, but you can also do this on the experiential

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.080
 level and the perceptual level.

1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:19.360
 See, but then I can come back to a conscious state.

1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:30.120
 Okay, I particularly, I'm referring to the social aspect that the demonstration of consciousness

1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:35.800
 is a really nice thing at a party when you're trying to meet a new person.

1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:42.000
 It's a nice thing to know that they're conscious and they can, I don't know how fundamental

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.000
 consciousness is in human interaction, but it seems like to be at least an important

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:48.000
 part.

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:55.640
 And I asked that in the same kind of way for robots, you know, in order to create a rich,

1:02:55.640 --> 1:03:00.680
 compelling human robot interaction, it feels like there needs to be elements of consciousness

1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:02.880
 within that interaction.

1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:05.200
 My cat is obviously conscious.

1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:07.560
 And so my cat can do this party trick.

1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:09.320
 She also knows that I am conscious.

1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:14.040
 We're able to have feedback about the fact that we are both acting on models of our own

1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:15.040
 awareness.

1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:21.360
 And the question is, how hard is it for the robot, artificially created robot to achieve

1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:24.440
 cat level and party tricks?

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:25.440
 Yes.

1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:30.240
 So the issue for me is currently not so much on how to build a system that creates a story

1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:35.080
 about a robot that lives in the world, but to make an adequate representation of the

1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:36.840
 world.

1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:40.400
 And the model that you and me have is a unified one.

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:45.600
 It's one where you basically make sense of everything that you can perceive every feature

1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:50.440
 in the world that enters your perception can be relationally mapped to a unified model

1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:51.940
 of everything.

1:03:51.940 --> 1:03:55.680
 And we don't have an AI that is able to construct such a unified model yet.

1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:58.840
 So you need that unified model to do the party trick?

1:03:58.840 --> 1:03:59.840
 Yes.

1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:04.200
 I think that it doesn't make sense if this thing is conscious, but not in the same universe

1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:06.960
 as you, because you could not relate to each other.

1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:12.720
 So what's the process, would you say, of engineering consciousness in the machine?

1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:14.760
 What are the ideas here?

1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:19.200
 So you probably want to have some kind of perceptual system.

1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:24.920
 This perceptual system is a processing agent that is able to track sensory data and predict

1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:30.080
 the next frame in the sensory data from the previous frames of the sensory data and the

1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:31.880
 current state of the system.

1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:37.720
 So the current state of the system is in perception instrumental to predicting what happens next.

1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:41.080
 And this means you build lots and lots of functions that take all the blips that you

1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:47.040
 feel on your skin and that you see on your retina or that you hear and puts them into

1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:51.520
 a set of relationships that allows you to predict what kind of sensory data, what kind

1:04:51.520 --> 1:04:56.160
 of sensor of blips, your vector of blips you're going to perceive in the next frame.

1:04:56.160 --> 1:05:02.080
 This is tuned and it's constantly tuned until it gets as accurate as it can.

1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:08.200
 You build a very accurate prediction mechanism that is step one of the perception.

1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:11.840
 So first you predict, then you perceive and see the error in your prediction.

1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:14.040
 And you have to do two things to make that happen.

1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:20.560
 One is you have to build a network of relationships that are constraints, that take all the variants

1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:26.600
 in the world to put each of the variances into a variable that is connected with relationships

1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:28.200
 to other variables.

1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:31.240
 And these relationships are computable functions that constrain each other.

1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:35.720
 So when you see a nose that points a certain direction in space, you have a constraint

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:39.360
 that says there should be a phase nearby that has the same direction.

1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:42.480
 And if that is not the case, you have some kind of contradiction that you need to resolve

1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:46.080
 because it's probably not a nose, what you're looking at, it just looks like one.

1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:52.640
 So you have to reinterpret the data until you get to a point where your model converges.

1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:58.720
 And this process of making the sensory data fit into your model structure is what PRG

1:05:58.720 --> 1:06:01.440
 calls the assimilation.

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:05.840
 And accommodation is the change of the models, where you change your model such a way that

1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:07.560
 you can assimilate everything.

1:06:07.560 --> 1:06:12.800
 So you're talking about building a hell of an awesome perception system that's able

1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:16.360
 to do prediction and perception and correct and improving.

1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:18.600
 Wait, there's more.

1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:19.600
 Yes, there's more.

1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:25.000
 So the first thing that we wanted to do is minimize the contradictions in the model.

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.440
 And of course, it's very easy to make a model in which you minimize the contradictions just

1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:31.720
 by allowing that it can be in many, many possible states.

1:06:31.720 --> 1:06:36.080
 So if you increase degrees of freedom, you will have fewer contradictions.

1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:40.440
 But you also want to reduce the degrees of freedom because degrees of freedom mean uncertainty.

1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:44.600
 You want your model to reduce uncertainty as much as possible.

1:06:44.600 --> 1:06:46.760
 But reducing uncertainty is expensive.

1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:52.640
 So you have to have a tradeoff between minimizing contradictions and reducing uncertainty.

1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:57.520
 And you have only a finite amount of compute and experimental time and effort available

1:06:57.520 --> 1:06:59.560
 to reduce uncertainty in the world.

1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:02.920
 So you need to assign value to what you observe.

1:07:02.920 --> 1:07:07.320
 So you need some kind of motivational system that is estimating what you should be looking

1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:10.920
 at and what you should be thinking about it, how you should be applying your resources

1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:13.080
 to model what that is.

1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:17.400
 So you need to have something like convergence links that tell you how to get from the present

1:07:17.400 --> 1:07:19.200
 state of the model to the next one.

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:23.680
 You need to have these compatibility links that tell you which constraints exist and

1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:25.840
 which constraint violations exist.

1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:30.400
 And you need to have some kind of motivational system that tells you what to pay attention

1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:31.400
 to.

1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:33.080
 So now we have a second agent next to the perceptual agent.

1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:35.080
 We have a motivational agent.

1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:39.600
 This is a cybernetic system that is modeling what the system needs, what's important for

1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:44.080
 the system, and that interacts with the perceptual system to maximize the expected reward.

1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:50.320
 And you're saying a motivational system is some kind of, like, what is it, a high level

1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:52.680
 narrative over some lower level?

1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:56.560
 No, it's just your brainstem stuff, the limbic system stuff that tells you, OK, now you

1:07:56.560 --> 1:07:59.440
 should get something to eat because I've just measured your geo blood sugar.

1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:02.880
 So you mean the motivational system, like the lower level stuff, like hungry?

1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:03.880
 Yes.

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:07.520
 So there's basically physiological needs and some cognitive needs and some social needs

1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:08.520
 and they all interact.

1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:12.840
 And they all implemented different parts in your nervous system as the motivational system.

1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:14.840
 But they're basically cybernetic feedback loops.

1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:18.600
 It's not that complicated, it's just a lot of code.

1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:23.640
 And so you now have a motivational agent that makes your robot go for the ball or that makes

1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:27.840
 your worm go to eat food and so on.

1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:31.240
 And you have the perceptual system that lets it predicts the environment so it's able

1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:33.840
 to solve that control problem to some degree.

1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:37.360
 And now what we learned is that it's very hard to build a machine learning system that

1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:42.360
 looks at all the data simultaneously to see what kind of relationships could exist between

1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:43.440
 them.

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:45.720
 So you need to selectively model the world.

1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:49.600
 You need to figure out, where can I make the biggest difference if I would put the following

1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:51.440
 things together?

1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:53.160
 Sometimes you find a gradient for that, right?

1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:56.600
 When you have a gradient, you don't need to remember where you came from.

1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:59.520
 You just follow the gradient until it doesn't get any better.

1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:03.120
 But if you have a world where the problems are discontinuous and research spaces are

1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:07.480
 discontinuous, you need to retain memory of what you explored.

1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:10.760
 You need to construct a plan of what to explore next.

1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:15.560
 And this thing that means that you have next to this perceptual construction system and

1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:21.640
 the motivational cybernetics, an agent that is paying attention to what it should select

1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:24.480
 at any given moment to maximize reward.

1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:29.040
 And this scanning system, this attention agent is required for consciousness.

1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:32.720
 And consciousness is its control model.

1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:37.640
 So it's the indexed memories that this thing retains when it manipulates the perceptual

1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:44.960
 representations to maximize the value and minimize the conflicts and to increase coherence.

1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:49.840
 So the purpose of consciousness is to create coherence in your perceptual representations,

1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:55.080
 remove conflicts, predict the future, construct counterfactual representations so you can coordinate

1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:57.680
 your actions and so on.

1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:00.320
 And in order to do this, it needs to form memories.

1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:04.520
 These memories are partial binding states of the working memory contents that are being

1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:10.280
 revisited later on to backtrack, to undo certain states, to look for alternatives.

1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:14.540
 And these indexed memories that you can recall, that is what you perceive as your stream of

1:10:14.540 --> 1:10:16.120
 consciousness.

1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:19.520
 And being able to recall these memories, this is what makes you conscious.

1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:26.280
 If you could not remember what you paid attention to, you wouldn't be conscious.

1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:31.560
 So consciousness is the index in the memory database, okay.

1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:37.340
 But let me sneak up to the questions of consciousness a little further.

1:10:37.340 --> 1:10:42.800
 So we usually relate suffering to consciousness.

1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:49.840
 So the capacity to suffer, I think to me that's a really strong sign of consciousness, is

1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:53.120
 a thing that can suffer.

1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:55.600
 How is that useful?

1:10:55.600 --> 1:11:03.000
 And, like, in your model, what you just described, which is indexing of memories, and what is

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:09.720
 the coherence with the perception, with this predictive thing that's going on in the perception,

1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:14.280
 how does suffering relate to any of that, you know, the higher level of suffering that

1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:15.680
 humans do?

1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:20.000
 Basically, pain is a reinforcement signal.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:25.320
 And pain is a signal that one part of your brain sends to another part of your brain,

1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:30.440
 or an abstract sense, part of your mind sends to another part of the mind to regulate its

1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:35.240
 behavior, to tell it the behavior that you're currently exhibiting should be improved.

1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:40.640
 And this is a signal that I tell you to move away from what you're currently doing and

1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:42.440
 push into a different direction.

1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:48.120
 So pain gives you a part of you an impulse to do something differently.

1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:52.760
 But sometimes this doesn't work, because the training part of your brain is talking to

1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:57.400
 the wrong region, or because it has the wrong model of the relationships in the world.

1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:01.000
 Maybe you're mismodeling yourself, or you're mismodeling the relationship of yourself to

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.640
 the world, or you're mismodeling the dynamics of the world.

1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:08.080
 So you're trying to improve something that cannot be improved by generating more pain.

1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:10.560
 But the system doesn't have any alternative.

1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:12.520
 So it doesn't get better.

1:12:12.520 --> 1:12:15.680
 What do you do if something doesn't get better, and you want it to get better?

1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:20.200
 You increase the strength of the signal, and when the signal becomes chronic, when it becomes

1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:24.560
 permanent, without a change inside, this is what we call suffering.

1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:29.080
 And the purpose of consciousness is to deal with contradictions, with things that cannot

1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:30.400
 be resolved.

1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:35.160
 The purpose of consciousness, I think, is similar to a conductor in an orchestra.

1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:38.840
 When everything works well, the orchestra doesn't need much of a conductor, as long

1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:40.400
 as it's coherent.

1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:44.880
 But when there is a lack of coherence, or something is consistently producing disharmony

1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:49.080
 and mismatches, then the conductor becomes alert and interacts with it.

1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:52.800
 So suffering attracts the activity of our consciousness.

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:57.800
 And the purpose of that is ideally that we bring new layers online, new layers of modeling

1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:04.720
 that are able to create a model of the dysregulation so we can deal with it.

1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:08.800
 And this means that we typically get higher level consciousness, so to speak.

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:12.720
 We get some consciousness above our pay grade, maybe, if we have some suffering early in

1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:13.720
 our life.

1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:17.200
 There are really interesting people at trauma early on in their childhood.

1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:23.360
 And trauma means that you are suffering an injury for which the system is not prepared,

1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:28.040
 which it cannot deal with, which it cannot insulate itself from, so something breaks.

1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:35.320
 And this means that the behavior of the system is permanently disturbed in a way that some

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:39.680
 mismatch exists now in a regulation, that just by following your impulses, by following

1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:44.480
 the pain in the direction which it hurts, the situation doesn't improve, but get worse.

1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:49.920
 And so what needs to happen is that you grow up, and that part that is grown up is able

1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:53.240
 to deal with the part that is stuck in this earlier phase.

1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:59.360
 Yeah, so it leads to growth, adding extra layers to your cognition.

1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:05.520
 Let me ask you then, because I got a stick on suffering, the ethics of the whole thing.

1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:11.920
 So not our consciousness, but the consciousness of others, you've tweeted, one of my biggest

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:16.280
 fears is that insects could be conscious.

1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:20.400
 The amount of suffering on earth would be unthinkable.

1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:30.320
 So when we think of other conscious beings, is suffering a property of consciousness that

1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:32.720
 we're most concerned about?

1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:45.360
 So I'm still thinking about robots, how to make sense of other nonhuman things that appear

1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:50.840
 to have the depth of experience that humans have.

1:14:50.840 --> 1:14:57.440
 And to me, that means consciousness and the darkest side of that, which is suffering,

1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:00.440
 the capacity to suffer.

1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:06.920
 So I start thinking, how much responsibility do we have for those other conscious beings?

1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:13.200
 That's where the definition of consciousness becomes most urgent.

1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:18.680
 Like having to come up with the definition of consciousness becomes most urgent, is who

1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:22.320
 should we, and should we not be torturing?

1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:26.400
 There's no general answer to this.

1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:29.240
 Was jingles kind of doing anything wrong?

1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:32.080
 It depends on how you look at it.

1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:39.000
 Well, he drew a line somewhere where this is us and that's them.

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.040
 It's the circle of empathy.

1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:48.240
 It's like, you don't have to use the word consciousness, but these are the things that

1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:52.600
 matter to me if they suffer or not, and these are the things that don't matter to me.

1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:58.680
 But when one of his commanders failed him, he broke his spine and let him die in a horrible

1:15:58.680 --> 1:15:59.680
 way.

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:05.360
 And so in some sense, I think he was indifferent to suffering, or he was not indifferent in

1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:10.520
 the sense that he didn't see it as useful if he inflicted suffering.

1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:14.160
 But he did not see it as something that had to be avoided.

1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:15.520
 That was not the goal.

1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:21.240
 The question was, how can I use suffering and the infliction of suffering to reach my goals

1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:23.040
 from his perspective?

1:16:23.040 --> 1:16:30.160
 I see so like different societies throughout history put different value on the different

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:35.720
 individuals, different psychies, but also even the objective of avoiding suffering.

1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:43.960
 Some societies probably, I mean, this is where religious belief really helps, that afterlife,

1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:49.680
 that doesn't matter that you suffer or die, what matters is you suffer honorably so that

1:16:49.680 --> 1:16:51.160
 you enter the afterlife.

1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:58.520
 It seems to be superstitious to me, basically beliefs that assert things for which no evidence

1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:02.280
 exist are incompatible with sound epistemology.

1:17:02.280 --> 1:17:06.000
 And I don't think that religion has to be superstitious, otherwise it should be condemned

1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:07.000
 in all cases.

1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000
 Okay, actually, you're somebody who's saying, we live in a dream world, we have zero evidence

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:11.000
 for anything.

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.520
 It's not the case.

1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:17.920
 They are limits to what languages can be constructed, mathematics breaks solid evidence

1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:19.640
 for its own structure.

1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:24.620
 And once we have some idea of what languages exist and how a system can learn and what

1:17:24.620 --> 1:17:31.800
 learning itself is in the first place, and so on, we can begin to realize that our intuitions

1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:37.160
 that we are able to learn about the regularities of the world and minimize surprise and understand

1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:40.840
 the nature of our own agency to some degree of abstraction.

1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:41.840
 That's not an illusion.

1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:49.480
 So just because we live in a dream world doesn't mean mathematics can't give us

1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:54.880
 a consistent glimpse of physical, of objective reality.

1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:59.280
 We can basically distinguish useful encodings from useless encodings.

1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:05.360
 And when we apply our truth seeking to the world, we know we usually cannot find out

1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:07.560
 whether a certain thing is true.

1:18:07.560 --> 1:18:11.640
 What we typically do is we take the state vector of the universe separated into separate

1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:14.520
 objects that interact with each other through interfaces.

1:18:14.520 --> 1:18:17.600
 And this distinction that we are making is not completely arbitrary.

1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:23.480
 It's done to optimize the compression that we can apply to our models of the universe.

1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:26.880
 So we can predict what's happening with our limited resources.

1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:29.400
 In this sense, it's not arbitrary.

1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:33.760
 But the separation of the world into objects that are somehow discrete and interacting

1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:36.960
 with each other is not the true reality.

1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:41.800
 The boundaries between the objects are projected into the world, not arbitrarily projected,

1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:45.760
 but still it's only an approximation of what's actually the case.

1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:50.920
 And we sometimes notice that we run into contradictions when we try to understand high level things

1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:56.960
 like economic aspects of the world and so on or political aspects or psychological aspects

1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:00.920
 where we make simplifications and the objects that we are using to separate the world are

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:04.760
 just one of many possible projections of what's going on.

1:19:04.760 --> 1:19:09.080
 And so it's not in this postmodernist sense completely arbitrary and you're free to pick

1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:12.280
 what you want or dismiss what you don't like because it's all stories.

1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:13.280
 No, that's not true.

1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:17.360
 You have to show for every model of how well it predicts the world.

1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:21.760
 So the confidence that you should have in the entities of your models should correspond

1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:24.520
 to the evidence that you have.

1:19:24.520 --> 1:19:33.520
 Can I ask you in a small tangent to talk about your favorite set of ideas and people, which

1:19:33.520 --> 1:19:35.640
 is postmodernism?

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:39.400
 What?

1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:40.400
 What is postmodernism?

1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:42.080
 How would you define it?

1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:49.720
 And why, to you, is it not a useful framework of thought?

1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:53.440
 Postmodernism is something that I'm really not an expert on.

1:19:53.440 --> 1:20:01.560
 And postmodernism is a set of philosophical ideas that is difficult to lump together,

1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:07.080
 that is characterized by some useful thinkers, some of them poststructuralists and so on.

1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:11.240
 And I'm mostly not interested in it because I think that it's not leading me anywhere

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:14.200
 that I find particularly useful.

1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:19.280
 It's mostly, I think, born out of the insight that the ontologies that we impose on the

1:20:19.280 --> 1:20:23.720
 world are not literally true and that we can often get to a different interpretation by

1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:27.840
 the world by using a different ontology that is different separation of the world into

1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:30.040
 interacting objects.

1:20:30.040 --> 1:20:35.440
 But the idea that this makes the world a set of stories that are arbitrary, I think, is

1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:42.000
 wrong, and the people that are engaging in this type of philosophy are working in an

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.120
 area that I largely don't find productive.

1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:46.360
 There is nothing useful coming out of this.

1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:50.600
 So this idea that truth is relative is not something that has, in some sense, informed

1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:54.840
 physics or theory of relativity, and there is no feedback between those.

1:20:54.840 --> 1:21:00.840
 There is no meaningful influence of this type of philosophy on the sciences or on engineering

1:21:00.840 --> 1:21:02.400
 or on politics.

1:21:02.400 --> 1:21:09.680
 But there is a very strong information of this on ideology because it basically has become

1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:16.560
 an ideology that is justifying itself by the notion that truth is a relative concept.

1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:21.840
 And it's not being used in such a way that the philosophers or sociologists that take

1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:26.640
 up these ideas say, oh, I should doubt my own ideas because maybe my separation of the

1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:30.240
 world into objects is not completely valid and I should maybe use the different one

1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:33.680
 and be open to pluralism of ideas.

1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:37.400
 But it mostly exists to dismiss the ideas of other people.

1:21:37.400 --> 1:21:42.440
 It becomes a political weapon of sorts to achieve power.

1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:49.080
 Basically there's nothing wrong, I think, with developing a philosophy around this.

1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:55.320
 But to develop norms around the idea that truth is something that is completely negotiable

1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:58.560
 is incompatible with the scientific project.

1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:06.200
 And I think if the academia has no defense against the ideological parts of the postmodernist

1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:08.360
 movement, it's doomed.

1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:09.360
 Right.

1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:15.040
 You have to acknowledge the ideological part of any movement, actually, including postmodernism.

1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:17.760
 Well, the question is what an ideology is.

1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:23.400
 And to me, an ideology is basically a viral memeplex that is changing your mind in such

1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:26.160
 a way that reality gets warped.

1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:29.720
 It gets warped in such a way that you're being cut off from the rest of human thought space.

1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:35.080
 And you cannot consider things outside of the range of ideas of your own ideology as

1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:36.080
 possibly true.

1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:37.080
 Right.

1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:39.600
 So I mean, there's certain properties to an ideology that make it harmful.

1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:46.840
 One of them is that dogmatism of just certainty, dogged certainty in that you're right.

1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:49.000
 You have the truth and nobody else does.

1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:50.360
 But what is creating this certainty?

1:22:50.360 --> 1:22:54.280
 It's very interesting to look at the type of model that is being produced.

1:22:54.280 --> 1:22:56.760
 Is it basically just a strong prior?

1:22:56.760 --> 1:23:00.640
 And you tell people, oh, this idea that you consider to be very true, the evidence for

1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:03.000
 this is actually just much weaker than you thought.

1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:06.280
 And look here at some studies, no, this is not how it works.

1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:12.520
 It's usually normative, which means some thoughts are unthinkable because they would

1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:17.320
 change your identity into something that is no longer acceptable.

1:23:17.320 --> 1:23:20.280
 And this cuts you off from considering an alternative.

1:23:20.280 --> 1:23:25.560
 And many de facto religions use this trick to lock people into a certain mode of thought.

1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:27.680
 And this removes agency over your own thoughts.

1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:28.800
 And it's very ugly to me.

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:35.160
 It's basically not just a process of domestication, but it's actually an intellectual castration

1:23:35.160 --> 1:23:36.160
 that happens.

1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:43.480
 It's an inability to think creatively and to bring forth new thoughts.

1:23:43.480 --> 1:23:53.360
 And ask you about substances, chemical substances that affect the video game, the dream world.

1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:59.000
 So psychedelics, that increasing have been getting a lot of research done on them.

1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:04.960
 So in general, psychedelics, psilocybin, MDMA, but also a really interesting one, the big

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:07.880
 one, which is DMT.

1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:14.720
 What and where are the places that these substances take the mind that is operating in the dream

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:15.720
 world?

1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:22.360
 Do you have an interesting sense how this throws a wrinkle into the prediction model?

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:24.600
 Is it just some weird little quirk?

1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:31.640
 Or is there some fundamental expansion of the mind going on?

1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:36.840
 I suspect that a way to look at psychedelics is that they induce particular types of lucid

1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:38.640
 dreaming states.

1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:44.640
 So it's a state in which certain connections are being severed in your mind and no longer

1:24:44.640 --> 1:24:45.640
 active.

1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:50.080
 Your mind basically gets free to move in a certain direction because some inhibition,

1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:53.000
 some particular inhibition doesn't work anymore.

1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:59.320
 And as a result, you might stop having yourself or you might stop perceiving the world as three

1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:01.080
 dimensional.

1:25:01.080 --> 1:25:04.680
 And you can explore that state.

1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:08.720
 And I suppose that for every state that can be induced with psychedelics, there are people

1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:11.160
 that are naturally in that state.

1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:16.040
 So sometimes psychedelics that shift you through a range of possible mental states.

1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:19.880
 And they can also shift you out of the range of permissible mental states that is where

1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:23.000
 you can make predictive models of reality.

1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:30.160
 And what I observe in people that use psychedelics a lot is that they tend to be overfitting.

1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:36.600
 Fitting means that you are using more bits for modeling the dynamics of a function than

1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:38.240
 you should.

1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:43.440
 And so you can fit your curve to extremely detailed things in the past, but this model

1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:46.320
 is no longer predictive for the future.

1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:49.680
 What is it about psychedelics that forces that?

1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:51.080
 I thought it would be the opposite.

1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:59.440
 I thought it's a good mechanism for generalization, for regularization.

1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:08.800
 So it feels like psychedelics expansion of the mind, like forcing your model to be nonpredictive

1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:11.520
 is a good thing.

1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:17.320
 Meaning like it's almost like, okay, what I would say is psychedelics are akin to traveling

1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:22.360
 to a totally different environment, like going, if you've never been to like India or something

1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:26.640
 like that from the United States, very different set of people, different culture, different

1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:31.800
 food, different roads and values and all those kinds of things.

1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:37.920
 So psychedelics can, for instance, teleport people into a universe that is hyperbolic,

1:26:37.920 --> 1:26:43.520
 which means that if you imagine a room that you are in, you can turn around 360 degrees

1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:44.760
 and you didn't go full circle.

1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:48.160
 You need to go 20 degrees to full circle.

1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:52.920
 So the things that people learn in that state cannot be easily transferred in this universe

1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:53.920
 that we are in.

1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:58.520
 It could be that if they're able to abstract and understand what happened to them, that

1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:04.040
 they understand that some part of their spatial cognition has been desynchronized and has

1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:05.840
 found a different synchronization.

1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:08.760
 And this different synchronization happens to be a hyperbolic one, right?

1:27:08.760 --> 1:27:10.880
 So you learn something interesting about your brain.

1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:14.800
 It's difficult to understand what exactly happened, but we get pretty good idea once

1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:17.640
 we understand how the brain is representing geometry.

1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:26.200
 Yeah, but it doesn't give you a fresh perspective on the physical reality.

1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:27.920
 Who's making that sound?

1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:30.400
 Is it inside my head or is it external?

1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:38.280
 Well, there is no sound outside of your mind, but it's making sense of phenomenon physics.

1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:46.240
 Yeah, in the physical reality, there's sound waves traveling through air.

1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:47.240
 Okay.

1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:48.760
 So that's our model of what happened.

1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:51.840
 That's our model of what happened.

1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:52.840
 Right.

1:27:52.840 --> 1:28:01.040
 Don't psychedelics give you a fresh perspective on this physical reality, not this physical

1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:06.400
 reality, but this more...

1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:09.840
 What do you call the dream world that's mapped directly to...

1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:13.800
 The purpose of dreaming at night, I think, is data augmentation.

1:28:13.800 --> 1:28:14.800
 Exactly.

1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:15.800
 So you basically...

1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:17.760
 That's very similar to psychedelics.

1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:21.880
...change parameters about the things that you have learned.

1:28:21.880 --> 1:28:26.160
 And for instance, when you are young, you have seen things from certain perspectives,

1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:27.400
 but not from others.

1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:31.920
 So your brain is generating new perspectives of objects that you already know, which means

1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:35.920
 they can learn to recognize them later from different perspectives, and I suspect that's

1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:40.360
 the reason why many of us remember to have flying dreams as children, because it's just

1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:45.000
 different perspectives of the world that we already know, and that it starts to generate

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:50.480
 these different perspective changes, and then it fluidly turns this into a flying dream

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:52.360
 to make sense of what's happening.

1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:56.040
 So you fill in the gaps, and suddenly you see yourself flying.

1:28:56.040 --> 1:28:58.920
 And similar things can happen with semantic relationships.

1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:02.920
 So it's not just spatial relationships, but it can also be the relationships between

1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:05.400
 ideas that are being changed.

1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:12.040
 And it seems that the mechanisms that make that happen during dreaming are interacting

1:29:12.040 --> 1:29:17.320
 with these same receptors that are being simulated by psychedelics.

1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:22.560
 So I suspect that there is a thing that I haven't read really about, the way in which

1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:28.120
 dreams are induced in the brain is not just that the activity of the brain gets tuned

1:29:28.120 --> 1:29:34.080
 down because your eyes are closed and you no longer get enough data from your eyes, but

1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:39.560
 there is a particular type of neurotransmitter that is saturating your brain during these

1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:44.960
 phases, during the RM phases, and you produce controlled hallucinations.

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:49.960
 And psychedelics are linking into these mechanisms, I suspect.

1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:54.160
 So isn't that another trickier form of data augmentation?

1:29:54.160 --> 1:29:55.240
 Yes.

1:29:55.240 --> 1:30:00.280
 But it's also data augmentation that can happen outside of the specification that your brain

1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:01.280
 is tuned to.

1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:06.640
 So basically people are overclocking their brains, and that produces states that are

1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:08.680
 subjectively extremely interesting.

1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:13.680
 But from the outside, very suspicious.

1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:20.000
 I think I'm overapplying the metaphor of a neural network in my own mind, which I just

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:22.680
 think that doesn't lead to overfitting.

1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:28.600
 But you were just sort of anecdotally saying my experiences with people that have no psychedelics

1:30:28.600 --> 1:30:30.400
 are that kind of quality.

1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:31.600
 I think it typically happens.

1:30:31.600 --> 1:30:37.400
 So if you look at people like Timothy Leary, and he has written beautiful manifestos about

1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:42.920
 the effect of LSD on people, he genuinely believed, he writes in these manifestos that

1:30:42.920 --> 1:30:47.120
 in the future, science and art will only be done on psychedelics because it's so much

1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:49.120
 more efficient and so much better.

1:30:49.120 --> 1:30:55.040
 And he gave LSD to children in this community of a few thousand people that he had near San

1:30:55.040 --> 1:30:56.040
 Francisco.

1:30:56.040 --> 1:31:00.600
 And basically he was losing touch with reality.

1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:05.080
 He did not understand the effects that the things that he was doing would have on the

1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:10.240
 reception of psychedelics by society, because he was unable to think critically about what

1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:11.240
 happened.

1:31:11.240 --> 1:31:15.280
 What happened was that he got in a euphoric state, that euphoric state happened because

1:31:15.280 --> 1:31:16.680
 he was overfitting.

1:31:16.680 --> 1:31:22.720
 He was taking this sense of euphoria and translating it into a model of actual success in the

1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:23.720
 world.

1:31:23.720 --> 1:31:29.760
 He was feeling better, limitations had disappeared, that he experienced to be existing, but he

1:31:29.760 --> 1:31:30.760
 didn't get superpowers.

1:31:30.760 --> 1:31:32.840
 I understand what you mean by overfitting now.

1:31:32.840 --> 1:31:37.600
 There's a lot of interpretation to the term overfitting in this case.

1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:38.720
 But I got you.

1:31:38.720 --> 1:31:44.320
 So he was getting positive rewards from a lot of actions that he shouldn't have put

1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:45.320
 in.

1:31:45.320 --> 1:31:46.320
 Yeah, but not just this.

1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:50.560
 So if you take, for instance, John Lilly, who was studying dolphin languages and aliens

1:31:50.560 --> 1:31:56.080
 and so on, a lot of people that used psychedelics became very loopy.

1:31:56.080 --> 1:32:00.320
 And the typical thing that you notice when people are on psychedelics is that they are

1:32:00.320 --> 1:32:04.040
 in a state where they feel that everything can be explained now.

1:32:04.040 --> 1:32:05.240
 Everything is clear.

1:32:05.240 --> 1:32:06.920
 Everything is obvious.

1:32:06.920 --> 1:32:12.240
 And sometimes they have indeed discovered a useful connection, but not always.

1:32:12.240 --> 1:32:15.320
 Very often these connections are over interpretations.

1:32:15.320 --> 1:32:21.360
 I wonder, there's a question of correlation versus causation.

1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:26.080
 And also I wonder if it's the psychedelics or if it's more the social, like being the

1:32:26.080 --> 1:32:32.760
 outsider and having a strong community of outsiders and having a leadership position

1:32:32.760 --> 1:32:38.040
 in an outsider cult like community, that could have a much stronger effect of overfitting

1:32:38.040 --> 1:32:41.880
 than do psychedelics themselves, the actual substances.

1:32:41.880 --> 1:32:43.480
 Because it's a counterculture thing.

1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:46.640
 So it could be that as opposed to the actual substance.

1:32:46.640 --> 1:32:53.280
 If you're a boring person who wears a suit and tie and works at a bank and takes psychedelics,

1:32:53.280 --> 1:32:57.800
 that could be a very different effect of psychedelics on your mind.

1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:02.840
 I'm just sort of raising the point that the people you referenced are already weirdos.

1:33:02.840 --> 1:33:03.840
 I'm not sure exactly.

1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:04.840
 No, not necessarily.

1:33:04.840 --> 1:33:11.280
 A lot of the people that tell me that they used psychedelics in a useful way started

1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:16.120
 out as squares and were liberating themselves because they were stuck.

1:33:16.120 --> 1:33:19.880
 They were basically stuck in local optimum of their own self model, of their relationship

1:33:19.880 --> 1:33:23.240
 to the world, and suddenly they had data augmentation.

1:33:23.240 --> 1:33:26.760
 They basically saw an experience, a space of possibilities.

1:33:26.760 --> 1:33:29.880
 They experienced what it would be like to be another person.

1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:35.240
 And they took important lessons from that experience back home.

1:33:35.240 --> 1:33:36.240
 Yeah.

1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:45.080
 I mean, I love the metaphor of data augmentation because that's been the primary driver of

1:33:45.080 --> 1:33:50.200
 self supervised learning in the computer vision domain is data augmentation.

1:33:50.200 --> 1:33:58.720
 So it's funny to think of like chemically induced data augmentation in the human mind.

1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:03.520
 There's also a very interesting effect that I noticed.

1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:11.080
 I know several people who are speared to me that LSD has cured their migraines.

1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:17.280
 So severe cluster headaches or migraines that didn't respond to standard medication that

1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:19.440
 disappeared after a single dose.

1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:24.720
 And I don't recommend anybody doing this, especially not in the US where it's illegal.

1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:27.600
 And there are no studies on this for that reason.

1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:34.480
 But it seems that anecdotally that it basically can reset the serotonergic system.

1:34:34.480 --> 1:34:39.320
 So it's basically pushing them outside of their normal boundaries.

1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:44.400
 And as a result, it needs to find a new equilibrium and some people that equilibrium is better.

1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:47.240
 But it also follows that in other people, it might be worse.

1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:54.000
 So if you have a brain that is already teetering on the boundary to psychosis, it can be permanently

1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.200
 pushed over that boundary.

1:34:55.200 --> 1:34:58.920
 Well, that's why you have to do good science, which they're starting to do on all these different

1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:02.880
 substances of how well it actually works for the different conditions like MDMA seems

1:35:02.880 --> 1:35:05.200
 to help with PTSD.

1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:10.080
 Same with psilocybin that, you know, you need to do good science, meaning large studies

1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:11.080
 of large N.

1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:12.080
 Yeah.

1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:17.720
 Based on the existing studies with MDMA, it seems that if you look at Rick Doblin's

1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:23.160
 work and what he has published about this and talks about MDMA seems to be a psychologically

1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:26.880
 relatively safe drug, but it's physiologically not very safe.

1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:31.960
 That is, there is neurotoxicity if you would use a too large dose.

1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:37.200
 And if you combine this with alcohol, which a lot of kids do in party settings during

1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:42.560
 raves and so on, it's very hippotoxic, so basically you can kill your liver.

1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:46.920
 And this means that it's probably something that is best and most productively used in

1:35:46.920 --> 1:35:50.200
 clinical setting by people who really know what they're doing.

1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:56.000
 And I suspect that's also true for the other psychedelics that is, while the other psychedelics

1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:01.720
 are probably not as toxic as say alcohol, the effects on the psyche can be much more

1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:03.120
 profound and lasting.

1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:04.120
 Yeah.

1:36:04.120 --> 1:36:10.360
 Well, as far as I know, psilocybin, so mushrooms, magic mushrooms, as far as I know in terms

1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:15.280
 of the studies they're running, I think have no, like they're allowed to do what they're

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:17.200
 calling heroic doses.

1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:21.640
 So that one does not have a toxicity, so they could do like huge doses in a clinical setting

1:36:21.640 --> 1:36:24.840
 when they're doing study on psilocybin, which is kind of fun.

1:36:24.840 --> 1:36:25.840
 Yeah.

1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:30.440
 It seems that most of the psychedelics work in extremely small doses, which means that

1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:36.400
 the effect on the rest of the body is relatively low, and MDMA is probably the exception.

1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:40.480
 Maybe ketamine can be dangerous in larger doses because it can depress breathing and

1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:41.480
 so on.

1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:47.800
 But the LSD and psilocybin work in very, very small doses, at least the active part of them

1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:52.680
 of psilocybin LSD is only the active part.

1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:58.120
 But the effect that it can have on your mental wiring can be very dangerous, I think.

1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:00.840
 Let's talk about AI a little bit.

1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:08.240
 What are your thoughts about GPT3 and language models trained with cell supervised learning?

1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:14.680
 It came out quite a bit ago, but I wanted to get your thoughts on it.

1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:21.920
 In the 90s, I was in New Zealand and I had an amazing professor, Ian Witten, who realized

1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:28.280
 I was bored in class and put me in his lab, and he gave me the task to discover grammatical

1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:31.760
 structure in an unknown language.

1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:36.360
 The unknown language that I picked was English because it was the easiest one to find a corpus

1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:38.600
 four construct one.

1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:42.080
 He gave me the largest computer at the whole university.

1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:44.320
 It had two gigabytes of RAM, which was amazing.

1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:50.920
 I wrote everything in C with some in memory compression to do statistics over the language.

1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:56.040
 Next would create a dictionary of all the words, which basically tokenizes everything

1:37:56.040 --> 1:38:01.280
 and compresses things so they don't need to store the whole word, but just a code for

1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:02.560
 every word.

1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:09.080
 Then I was taking this all apart in sentences and I was trying to find all the relationships

1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:13.720
 between all the words and the sentences and do statistics over them.

1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:18.280
 That proved to be impossible because the complexity is just too large.

1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:22.480
 If you want to discover the relationship between an article and a noun, and there are three

1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:26.920
 adjectives in between, you cannot do ngram statistics and look at all the possibilities

1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:31.160
 that can exist, at least not with the resources that we had back then.

1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:35.240
 I realized I need to make some statistics over what I need to make statistics over.

1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:42.240
 I wrote something that was pretty much a hack that did this for at least first order relationships.

1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:47.480
 I came up with some kind of mutual information graph that was indeed discovering something

1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:50.680
 that looks exactly like the grammatical structure of the sentence.

1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:54.840
 Just by trying to encode the sentence in such a way that the words would be written in the

1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:59.480
 optimal order inside of the model.

1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:05.720
 What I also found is that if we would be able to increase the resolution of that and not

1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:10.040
 just use this model to reproduce grammatically correct sentences, we would also be able to

1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:15.200
 correct stylistically correct sentences by just having more bits in these relationships.

1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:18.880
 If we wanted to have meaning, we would have to go much higher order.

1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:23.160
 I didn't know how to make higher order models back then without spending way more years

1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:29.560
 in research on how to make the statistics over what we need to make statistics over.

1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:33.560
 This thing that we cannot look at the relationships between all the bits in your input is being

1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:36.040
 solved in different domains in different ways.

1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:42.280
 In computer graphics, the computer vision standard method for many years now is convolutional

1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:44.120
 neural networks.

1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:48.320
 convolutional neural networks are hierarchies of filters that exploit the fact that neighboring

1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:53.400
 pixels in images are usually semantically related and distance pixels in images are usually

1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:55.680
 not semantically related.

1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:00.360
 You can just by grouping the pixels that are next to each other hierarchically together

1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:03.400
 reconstruct the shape of objects.

1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:08.640
 This is an important prior that we build into these models so they can converge quickly.

1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:13.560
 This doesn't work in language for the reason that adjacent words are often but not always

1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:19.720
 related and distant words are sometimes related while the words in between are not.

1:40:19.720 --> 1:40:23.120
 How can you learn the topology of language?

1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:30.280
 I think for this reason that this difficulty existed, the transformer was invented in natural

1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:33.440
 language processing not in vision.

1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:38.640
 What the transformer is doing, it's a hierarchy of layers where every layer learns what to

1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:43.520
 pay attention to in the given context in the previous layer.

1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:46.360
 What to make the statistics over.

1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:51.600
 And the context is significantly larger than the adjacent word.

1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:52.600
 Yes.

1:40:52.600 --> 1:41:00.320
 The context that GP3 has been using, the transformer itself is from 2017 and it wasn't using that

1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:02.360
 large of a context.

1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:07.080
 OpenAI has basically scaled up this idea as far as they could at the time.

1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:13.000
 The context is about 2048 symbols, tokens in the language.

1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:17.720
 These symbols are not characters, but they take the words and project them into a vector

1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:23.320
 space where words that are statistically cooccurring a lot are neighbors already.

1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:27.440
 So it's already a simplification of the problem a little bit.

1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:31.200
 Every word is basically a set of coordinates in a high dimensional space.

1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:36.080
 And then they use some kind of trick to also encode the order of the words in a sentence

1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:42.040
 or in the not just sentence, but 2048 tokens is about couple pages of text or two and a

1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:43.680
 half pages of text.

1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:49.160
 And so they managed to do pretty exhaustive statistics over the potential relationships

1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:51.720
 between two pages of text, which is tremendous, right?

1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:58.640
 I was just using a single sentence back then and I was only looking for first order relationships

1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:02.880
 and they were really looking for much, much higher level relationships.

1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:07.320
 And what they discover after they've fed this enormous amount of trim and they're pretty

1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:13.760
 much the written internet or the subset of it that had some quality, but substantial portion

1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:19.040
 of the common flaw that they're not only able to reproduce style, but they're also able

1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:24.640
 to reproduce some pretty detailed semantics like being able to add three digit numbers

1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:29.400
 and multiply two digit numbers or to translate between pro and languages and things like

1:42:29.400 --> 1:42:30.400
 that.

1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:34.280
 So the results that GBT3 got, I think were amazing.

1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:38.840
 By the way, I actually didn't check carefully.

1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:43.040
 It's funny you just mentioned how you coupled semantics to the multiplication.

1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:46.800
 Is it able to do some basic math on two digit numbers?

1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:47.800
 Yes.

1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:48.800
 Okay, interesting.

1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:52.680
 I thought, I thought there's a lot of failure cases.

1:42:52.680 --> 1:42:56.200
 Yeah, it basically fails if you take larger digit numbers.

1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:00.680
 So four digit numbers and so on makes carrying mistakes and so on.

1:43:00.680 --> 1:43:05.240
 And if you take larger numbers, you don't get useful results at all.

1:43:05.240 --> 1:43:12.200
 And this could be an issue of the training set where there are not many examples of successful

1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:15.920
 long form addition and standard human written text.

1:43:15.920 --> 1:43:19.720
 Humans aren't very good at doing three digit numbers either.

1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:22.600
 Yeah, they're not, you're not writing a lot about it.

1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:27.120
 And the other thing is that the loss function that is being used is only minimizing surprises.

1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:29.720
 So it's predicting what comes next in a typical text.

1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:33.760
 It's not trying to go for causal closure first as we do.

1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:34.760
 Yeah.

1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:42.080
 But the fact that that kind of prediction works to generate text that's semantically

1:43:42.080 --> 1:43:45.640
 rich and consistent is interesting.

1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:51.040
 So yeah, so it's amazing that it's able to generate semantically consistent text.

1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:52.040
 It's not consistent.

1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:54.840
 So the problem is that it loses coherence at some point.

1:43:54.840 --> 1:44:00.400
 But it's also, I think, not correct to say that GP2C is unable to deal with semantics

1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:05.480
 at all because you ask it to perform certain transformations in text and it performs these

1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:07.400
 transformation in text.

1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:12.680
 And the kind of additions that is able to perform are transformations in text, right?

1:44:12.680 --> 1:44:15.400
 And there are proper semantics involved.

1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:16.400
 You can also do more.

1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:24.360
 There was a paper that was generating lots and lots of mathematically correct text and

1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:26.680
 was feeding this into a transformer.

1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:32.320
 And as a result, it was able to learn how to do differentiation, integration in race

1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:38.520
 that according to the authors, Mathematica could not, to which some of the people in

1:44:38.520 --> 1:44:43.040
 Mathematica responded that they were not using Mathematica in the right way and so on.

1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:46.840
 I have not really followed the resolution of this conflict.

1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:52.680
 This part, as a small tangent, I really don't like in machine learning papers, which they

1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:56.720
 often do anecdotal evidence.

1:44:56.720 --> 1:45:02.040
 They'll find one example in some kind of specific use of Mathematica and demonstrate, look,

1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:07.760
 they'll show successes and failures, but they won't have a very clear representation of

1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:09.360
 how many cases this actually represents.

1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:12.800
 Yes, but I think as a first paper, this is a pretty good start.

1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:19.360
 And so the take home message, I think, is that the authors could get better results

1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:24.120
 from this and their experiments than they could get from the vein, which they were using

1:45:24.120 --> 1:45:29.400
 computer algebra systems, which means that was not nothing.

1:45:29.400 --> 1:45:35.600
 And it's able to perform substantially better than GPTSV can, based on a much larger amount

1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:39.640
 of training data, using the same underlying algorithm.

1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:47.120
 Let me ask, again, so I'm using your tweets as if this is like Play Doh, right?

1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:51.880
 As if this is well thought out novels that you've written.

1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:58.840
 You tweeted, GPT4 is listening to us now.

1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:04.320
 This is one way of asking, what are the limitations of GPT3 when it scales?

1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:10.360
 So what do you think will be the capabilities of GPT4, GPT5, and so on?

1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:11.840
 What are the limits of this approach?

1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:16.520
 So obviously, when we are writing things right now, everything that we are writing now is

1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:20.120
 going to be training data for the next generation of machine learning models.

1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:23.240
 So yes, of course, GPT4 is listening to us.

1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:25.720
 And I think the tweet is already a little bit older.

1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:32.000
 And we now have Wudao and we have a number of other systems that basically are placeholders

1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:33.000
 for GPT4.

1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:35.880
 I don't know what open AIS plans are in this card.

1:46:35.880 --> 1:46:39.120
 I read that tweet in several ways.

1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:44.920
 So one is obviously everything you put on the internet has used this training data.

1:46:44.920 --> 1:46:51.600
 But in a second way, we talked about agency.

1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:58.320
 I read it as almost like GPT4 is intelligent enough to be choosing to listen.

1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:04.880
 So not only did a programmer tell it to collect this data and use it for training, I almost

1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:09.240
 saw the humorous angle, which is like it has achieved AGI kind of thing.

1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:13.920
 Well, the thing is, could we be already believing in GPT5?

1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:21.160
 So GPT4 is listening, and GPT5 actually constructed the entirety of the reality where you can

1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:25.720
 Of course, in some sense, what everybody is trying to do right now in AI is to extend

1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:29.800
 the transformer to be able to deal with video.

1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:32.480
 And there are very promising extensions, right?

1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:36.680
 There's a work by Google that is called Perceiver.

1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:41.760
 And that is overcoming some of the limitations of the transformer by letting it learn the

1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:50.120
 topology of the different modalities separately and by training it to find better input features.

1:47:50.120 --> 1:47:57.640
 So the basic feature abstractions that are being used by this successor to GPT3 are chosen

1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:00.960
 such a way that it's able to deal with video input.

1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:02.320
 And there is more to be done.

1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:07.880
 So one of the limitations of GPT3 is that it's amnesiac.

1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:12.400
 So it forgets everything beyond the two pages that it currently reads also during generation,

1:48:12.400 --> 1:48:14.560
 not just during learning.

1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:18.760
 Do you think that's fixable within the space of deep learning?

1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:21.200
 Can you just make a bigger, bigger, bigger input?

1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:25.680
 No, I don't think that our own working memory is infinitely large.

1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:28.160
 It's probably also just a few thousand bits.

1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:31.960
 But what you can do is you can structure this working memory.

1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:37.160
 So instead of just force feeding this thing, a certain thing that it has to focus on and

1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:42.640
 it's not allowed to focus on anything else because it's network, you allow it to construct

1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:44.600
 its own working memory as we do.

1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:49.120
 When we are reading a book, it's not that we are focusing our attention in such a way

1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:51.920
 that we can only remember the current page.

1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:57.280
 We will also try to remember other pages and try to undo what we learned from them or modify

1:48:57.280 --> 1:48:58.680
 what we learned from them.

1:48:58.680 --> 1:49:01.000
 We might get up and take another book from the shelf.

1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:06.240
 We might go out and ask somebody that we can edit our working memory in any way that is

1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:11.480
 useful to put a context together that allows us to draw the right inferences and to learn

1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:13.160
 the right things.

1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:19.320
 So this ability to perform experiments on the world based on an attempt to become fully

1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:25.000
 coherent and to achieve causal closure, to achieve a certain aesthetic of your modeling,

1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:28.400
 that is something that eventually needs to be done.

1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:32.720
 And at the moment, we are skirting this in some sense by building systems that are larger

1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:37.600
 and faster so they can use dramatically larger resources and human beings can do much more

1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:42.760
 training data to get two models that in some sense are already very superhuman and in other

1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:45.600
 ways are laughingly incoherent.

1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:56.080
 So do you think making the systems, what would you say, multi resolutionals, some of the

1:49:56.080 --> 1:50:00.040
 language models are focused on two pages.

1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:03.560
 Some are focused on two books.

1:50:03.560 --> 1:50:06.680
 Some are focused on two years of reading.

1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:12.000
 Some are focused on a lifetime, so it's like stacks of GPT3s all the way down.

1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:13.840
 You want to have gaps in between them.

1:50:13.840 --> 1:50:17.200
 So it's not necessarily two years, there's no gaps.

1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:22.360
 It stinks out of two years or out of 20 years or 2,000 years or 2 billion years where you

1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:28.480
 are just selecting those bits that are predicted to be the most useful ones to understand what

1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:29.800
 you're currently doing.

1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:33.720
 And this prediction itself requires a very complicated model and that's the actual model

1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:34.720
 that you need to be making.

1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:39.200
 It's not just that you are trying to understand the relationships between things but what

1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:42.480
 you need to make relationships or discover relationships over.

1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:48.160
 I wonder what that thing looks like, what the architecture for the thing that's able

1:50:48.160 --> 1:50:50.040
 to have that kind of model.

1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:54.400
 I think it needs more degrees of freedom than the current models have.

1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:59.920
 So it starts out with the fact that you possibly don't just want to have a feed forward model,

1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:03.000
 but you want it to be fully recurrent.

1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:07.000
 And to make it fully recurrent, you probably need to loop it back into itself and allow

1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.360
 it to skip connections.

1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:14.200
 Once you do this, you're predicting the next frame and your internal next frame in every

1:51:14.200 --> 1:51:17.560
 moment and you are able to skip connection.

1:51:17.560 --> 1:51:23.880
 It means that signals can travel from the output of the network into the middle of the

1:51:23.880 --> 1:51:26.040
 network faster than the inputs do.

1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:28.240
 Do you think it can still be differentiable?

1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:31.120
 Do you think it still can be a neural network?

1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:33.120
 Sometimes it can and sometimes it cannot.

1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:37.440
 So it can still be a neural network but not the fully differentiable one.

1:51:37.440 --> 1:51:42.680
 And when you want to deal with non differentiable ones, you need to have an attention system

1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:46.720
 that is discrete and non dimensional and can perform grammatical operations.

1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:49.400
 You need to be able to perform program synthesis.

1:51:49.400 --> 1:51:54.160
 You need to be able to backtrack in this operations that you perform on this thing.

1:51:54.160 --> 1:51:56.600
 This thing needs a model of what it's currently doing.

1:51:56.600 --> 1:52:00.640
 And I think this is exactly the purpose of our own consciousness.

1:52:00.640 --> 1:52:05.520
 Yeah, the program things that trickle on your networks.

1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:11.580
 So let me ask you, it's not quite program synthesis, but the application of these language

1:52:11.580 --> 1:52:16.280
 models to generation to program synthesis, but generation of programs.

1:52:16.280 --> 1:52:21.520
 So if you look at GitHub OpenPilot, which is based on OpenAI's codecs, I don't know

1:52:21.520 --> 1:52:26.480
 if you got a chance to look at it, but it's the system that's able to generate code once

1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:33.240
 you prompt it with, what is it, like the header of a function with some comments, and it seems

1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:40.160
 to do an incredibly good job or not a perfect job, which is very important, but an incredibly

1:52:40.160 --> 1:52:43.280
 good job of generating functions.

1:52:43.280 --> 1:52:44.280
 What do you make of that?

1:52:44.280 --> 1:52:45.280
 Are you, is this exciting?

1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:50.280
 Or is this just a party trick, a demo, or is this revolutionary?

1:52:50.280 --> 1:52:57.080
 I haven't worked with it yet, so it's difficult for me to judge it, but I would not be surprised

1:52:57.080 --> 1:52:59.760
 if it turns out to be a revolutionary.

1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:04.040
 That's because the majority of programming tasks that are being done in the industry right

1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:06.200
 now are not creative.

1:53:06.200 --> 1:53:09.640
 People are writing code that other people have written, or they're putting things together

1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:11.680
 from code fragments that others have had.

1:53:11.680 --> 1:53:17.320
 And a lot of the work that programmers do in practice is to figure out how to overcome

1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:21.080
 the gaps in their current knowledge and the things that people have already done.

1:53:21.080 --> 1:53:24.200
 How to copy and paste from Stack Overflow, that's right.

1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:29.960
 And so, of course, we can automate that to make it much faster to copy and paste from

1:53:29.960 --> 1:53:30.960
 Stack Overflow.

1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:32.920
 Yes, but it's not just copying and pasting.

1:53:32.920 --> 1:53:38.480
 It's also basically learning which parts you need to modify to make them fit together.

1:53:38.480 --> 1:53:39.480
 Yeah.

1:53:39.480 --> 1:53:44.240
 Like literally, sometimes as simple as just changing the variable names, so it fits into

1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:45.240
 the rest of your code.

1:53:45.240 --> 1:53:48.520
 Yes, but this requires that you understand the semantics of what you're doing to some

1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:49.520
 degree.

1:53:49.520 --> 1:53:50.520
 Yeah.

1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:51.520
 And you can automate some of those things.

1:53:51.520 --> 1:53:52.520
 Yes.

1:53:52.520 --> 1:53:58.200
 The thing that makes people nervous, of course, is that a little bit wrong in a program can

1:53:58.200 --> 1:54:03.600
 have a dramatic effect on the actual final operation of that program.

1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:08.960
 So that's one little error, which in the space of language, it doesn't really matter, but

1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:12.080
 in the space of programs, it can matter a lot.

1:54:12.080 --> 1:54:15.800
 Yes, but this is already what is happening when humans program code.

1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:16.800
 Yeah.

1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:20.400
 So we have a technology to deal with this.

1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:25.600
 Somehow it becomes scarier when you know that a program generated code that's running a

1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:29.280
 nuclear power plant, it becomes scarier.

1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:31.480
 You know humans have errors too.

1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:32.480
 Exactly.

1:54:32.480 --> 1:54:38.320
 But it's scarier when a program is doing it because why?

1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:49.120
 I mean, there's a fear that a program may not be as good as humans to know when stuff

1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:56.240
 is important to not mess up.

1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:02.160
 There's a misalignment of priorities, of values, that's potential, that maybe that's the source

1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:03.160
 of the worry.

1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:11.680
 I mean, okay, if I give you code generated by GitHub OpenPilot and code generated by

1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:20.480
 a human and say, here, use one of these, how do you select today and in the next 10 years,

1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:22.000
 which code do you use?

1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:25.440
 Wouldn't you still be comfortable with the human?

1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:31.160
 At the moment, when you go to Stanford to get an MRI, they will write a bill to the

1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:34.840
 insurance over $20,000.

1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:39.320
 And of this, maybe half of that gets paid by the insurance and the quarter gets paid

1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:45.200
 by you and the MRI cost them $600 to make, maybe, probably less.

1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:52.200
 And what are the values of the person that writes the software and deploys this process?

1:55:52.200 --> 1:55:56.200
 It's very difficult for me to say whether I trust people.

1:55:56.200 --> 1:56:02.040
 I think that what happens there is a mixture of proper Anglo Saxon Protestant values where

1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:06.080
 somebody is trying to serve an abstract radar hole and organize crime.

1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:15.600
 Well, that's a very harsh, I think that's a harsh view of humanity.

1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:21.800
 There's a lot of bad people, whether incompetent or just malevolent in this world, yes.

1:56:21.800 --> 1:56:29.880
 But it feels like the more malevolent, so the more damage you do to the world, the more

1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:34.560
 resistance you have in your own human heart.

1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:38.960
 But I don't explain with malevolence or stupidity what can be explained by just people acting

1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:40.520
 on their incentives.

1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:46.960
 So what happens in Stanford is not that somebody is evil, it's just that they do what they're

1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:48.120
 being paid for.

1:56:48.120 --> 1:56:51.720
 No, it's not evil.

1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:53.760
 So no, I see that as malevolence.

1:56:53.760 --> 1:57:05.200
 I see, even like being a good German, as I told you offline, it's not absolute malevolence,

1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:06.200
 but it's a small amount.

1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:07.200
 It's cowardice.

1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:13.200
 I mean, when you see there's something wrong with the world, it's either incompetence,

1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:18.720
 you're not able to see it, or it's cowardice that you're not able to stand up.

1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:21.760
 Not necessarily in a big way, but in a small way.

1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:25.920
 So I do think that is in a bit of malevolence.

1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:28.160
 I'm not sure the example you're describing is a good example.

1:57:28.160 --> 1:57:31.520
 So the question is, what is it that you are aiming for?

1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:36.640
 And if you don't believe in the future, if you, for instance, think that the dollar is

1:57:36.640 --> 1:57:39.680
 going to crash, why would you try to save dollars?

1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:45.000
 If you don't think that humanity will be around in 100 years from now, because global

1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:50.480
 warming will wipe out civilization, why would you need to act as if it were?

1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:55.800
 So the question is, is there an overarching aesthetics that is projecting you and the

1:57:55.800 --> 1:58:00.320
 world into the future, which I think is the basic idea of religion, that you understand

1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:04.840
 the interactions that we have with each other as some kind of civilization level agent that

1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:07.240
 is projecting itself into the future?

1:58:07.240 --> 1:58:13.040
 If you don't have that shared purpose, what is there to be ethical for?

1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:19.440
 So I think when we talk about Essex and AI, we need to go beyond the insane bias discussions

1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:24.480
 and so on, where people are just measuring the distance between a statistic to their

1:58:24.480 --> 1:58:28.080
 preferred current world model.

1:58:28.080 --> 1:58:36.840
 The optimism, I was a little confused by the previous thing, just to clarify, there is

1:58:36.840 --> 1:58:44.240
 a kind of underlying morality to having an optimism that human civilization will persist

1:58:44.240 --> 1:58:47.160
 for longer than 100 years.

1:58:47.160 --> 1:58:54.840
 I think a lot of people believe that it's a good thing for us to keep living and thriving.

1:58:54.840 --> 1:58:57.040
 This morality itself is not an end to itself.

1:58:57.040 --> 1:59:03.200
 It's instrumental to people living in 100 years from now, or 500 years from now.

1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:09.080
 So it's only justifiable if you actually think that it will lead to people or increase the

1:59:09.080 --> 1:59:12.760
 probability of people being arrived in that time frame.

1:59:12.760 --> 1:59:17.040
 And a lot of people don't actually believe that, at least not actively.

1:59:17.040 --> 1:59:19.360
 But I believe what exactly?

1:59:19.360 --> 1:59:23.840
 Most people don't believe that they can afford to act on such a model.

1:59:23.840 --> 1:59:27.600
 Basically what happens in the US is I think that the health care system is for a lot of

1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:31.160
 people no longer sustainable, which means that if they need the help of the health care

1:59:31.160 --> 1:59:33.640
 system, they're often not able to afford it.

1:59:33.640 --> 1:59:37.280
 And when they cannot help it, they are often going bankrupt.

1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:43.000
 I think the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the US is the health care system.

1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:44.960
 And that would not be necessary.

1:59:44.960 --> 1:59:49.440
 It's not because people are consuming more and more medical services and are achieving

1:59:49.440 --> 1:59:51.680
 a much, much longer life as a result.

1:59:51.680 --> 1:59:55.480
 That's not actually the story that is happening, because you can compare it to other countries.

1:59:55.480 --> 1:59:59.600
 And life expectancy in the US is currently not increasing, and it's not as high as in

1:59:59.600 --> 2:00:01.800
 all the other industrialized countries.

2:00:01.800 --> 2:00:06.480
 So some industrialized countries are doing better with a much cheaper health care system.

2:00:06.480 --> 2:00:12.040
 And what you can see is, for instance, at administrative bloat, the health care system

2:00:12.040 --> 2:00:18.880
 has maybe to some degree deliberately set up as a job placement program to allow people

2:00:18.880 --> 2:00:26.760
 to continue living in middle class existence, despite not having a useful use case in productivity.

2:00:26.760 --> 2:00:29.520
 So they are being paid to push paper around.

2:00:29.520 --> 2:00:33.800
 And the number of administrators in the health care system has been increasing much faster

2:00:33.800 --> 2:00:35.880
 than the number of practitioners.

2:00:35.880 --> 2:00:37.920
 And this is something that you have to pay for.

2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:42.960
 And also, the revenues that are being generated in the health care system are relatively large,

2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:44.560
 and somebody has to pay for them.

2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:49.280
 And the result why they are so large is because market mechanisms are not working.

2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:56.120
 The FDA is largely not protecting people from malpractice of health care providers.

2:00:56.120 --> 2:01:00.880
 The FDA is protecting health care providers from competition.

2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:03.560
 So this is a thing that it has to do with values.

2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:08.440
 And this is not because people are malicious on all levels, it's because they are not incentivized

2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:14.280
 to act on a greater whole on this idea that you treat somebody who comes to you as a patient

2:01:14.280 --> 2:01:16.320
 like you would treat a family member.

2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:21.160
 Yeah, but we're trying, I mean, you're highlighting a lot of the flaws of the different institutions

2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:26.440
 the systems were operating under, but I think there's a continued throughout history mechanism

2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:31.760
 design of trying to design incentives in such a way that these systems behave better and

2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:32.760
 better and better.

2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:37.880
 I mean, it's a very difficult thing to operate a society of hundreds of millions of people

2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:38.880
 effectively.

2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:39.880
 Yes.

2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:43.560
 So do we live in a society that is ever correcting?

2:01:43.560 --> 2:01:49.520
 Do we observe that our models of what we are doing are predictive of the future and

2:01:49.520 --> 2:01:51.920
 when they are not, we improve them?

2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:57.280
 Our laws adjudicated with clauses that you put into every law, what is meant to be achieved

2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:01.400
 by that law and the law will be automatically repealed if it's not achieving that, right?

2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:06.320
 If you are optimizing your own laws, if you're writing your own source code, you probably

2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:09.520
 make an estimate of what is the thing that's currently wrong in my life?

2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:12.280
 What is it that I should change about my own policies?

2:02:12.280 --> 2:02:14.200
 What is the expected outcome?

2:02:14.200 --> 2:02:18.520
 And if that outcome doesn't manifest, I will change the policy back, right?

2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:20.040
 Or I would change it to do something different.

2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:22.120
 Are we doing this on a societal level?

2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:23.120
 I think so.

2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:29.160
 I think it's easy to sort of highlight the, I think we're doing it in the way that, like

2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:33.040
 I operate my current life, I didn't sleep much last night.

2:02:33.040 --> 2:02:36.960
 You would say that Lex, the way you need to operate your life is you need to always get

2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:37.960
 sleep.

2:02:37.960 --> 2:02:42.200
 The fact that you didn't sleep last night is totally the wrong way to operate in your

2:02:42.200 --> 2:02:43.200
 life.

2:02:43.200 --> 2:02:48.280
 Like you should have gotten all your shit done in time and gotten to sleep because sleep

2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:52.760
 is very important for health, and you're highlighting, look, this person is not sleeping.

2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:59.760
 Look, the medical, the healthcare system is operating, but the point is, it seems like

2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:03.760
 this is the way, especially in the capitalist society, we operate, we keep running into

2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:04.760
 trouble.

2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:11.160
 And last minute, we tried to get our way out through innovation, and it seems to work.

2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:17.280
 You have a lot of people that ultimately are trying to build a better world and get urgency

2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:23.080
 about them when the problem becomes more and more imminent.

2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:24.480
 And that's the way this operates.

2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:32.040
 But if you look at the history, the long arc of history, it seems like that operating on

2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:37.040
 deadlines produces progress and builds better and better systems.

2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:42.480
 You probably agree with me that the US should have engaged in mass production in January

2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:49.640
 2020, and that we should have shut down the airports early on, and that we should have

2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:57.040
 made it mandatory that the people that work in nursery homes on campus, rather than living

2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:02.720
 at home and then coming in and infecting people in the nursing homes that had no immune response

2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:04.080
 to COVID.

2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:09.240
 And that is something that was, I think, visible back then, the correct decisions haven't

2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:10.240
 been made.

2:04:10.240 --> 2:04:12.680
 We would have the same situation again.

2:04:12.680 --> 2:04:15.880
 How do we know that these wrong decisions are not being made again?

2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:21.040
 Have the people that made the decisions to not protect the nursing homes been punished?

2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:26.120
 Have the people that made the wrong decisions with respect to testing that prevented the

2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:30.640
 development of testing by startup companies and the importing of tests from countries

2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:32.240
 that already had them?

2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:34.640
 Have these people been held responsible?

2:04:34.640 --> 2:04:38.760
 First of all, so what do you want to put before the firing squad?

2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:41.480
 I think they are… No, just make sure that this doesn't happen

2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:42.480
 again.

2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:47.520
 No, but it's not that, yes, they're being held responsible by many voices, by people

2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:49.000
 being frustrated.

2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:54.560
 There's new leaders being born now, they're going to see rise to the top in 10 years.

2:04:54.560 --> 2:05:01.200
 This moves slower than, there's obviously a lot of older incompetence and bureaucracy

2:05:01.200 --> 2:05:03.760
 and these systems move slowly.

2:05:03.760 --> 2:05:07.000
 They move like science one death at a time.

2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:14.600
 So, yes, I think the pain that's been felt in the previous year is reverberating throughout

2:05:14.600 --> 2:05:15.600
 the world.

2:05:15.600 --> 2:05:16.600
 Maybe I'm getting old.

2:05:16.600 --> 2:05:21.360
 I suspect that every generation in the US after the war has lost the plot even more.

2:05:21.360 --> 2:05:23.280
 I don't see this development.

2:05:23.280 --> 2:05:24.560
 The war of World War II?

2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:31.760
 Yes, so basically there was a time when we were modernist and in this modernist time,

2:05:31.760 --> 2:05:35.800
 the US felt actively threatened by the things that happened in the world.

2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:43.320
 The US was worried about possibility of failure and this imminence of possible failure led

2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:44.320
 to decisions.

2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:50.680
 There was a time when the government would listen to physicists about how to do things.

2:05:50.680 --> 2:05:53.680
 And the physicists were actually concerned about what the government should be doing.

2:05:53.680 --> 2:05:58.000
 So, they would be writing letters to the government and so, for instance, the decision for the

2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:02.800
 Manhattan Project was something that was driven in a conversation between physicists

2:06:02.800 --> 2:06:03.800
 and the government.

2:06:03.800 --> 2:06:06.880
 I don't think that the discussion would take place today.

2:06:06.880 --> 2:06:07.880
 I disagree.

2:06:07.880 --> 2:06:12.600
 I think if the virus was much deadlier, we would see a very different response.

2:06:12.600 --> 2:06:17.520
 I think the virus was not sufficiently deadly and instead, because it wasn't very deadly,

2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:22.920
 what happened is the current system started to politicize it.

2:06:22.920 --> 2:06:25.360
 This is what I realized with masks early on.

2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:32.200
 They were not very quickly became not as a solution, but they became a thing that politicians

2:06:32.200 --> 2:06:34.040
 used to divide the country.

2:06:34.040 --> 2:06:37.080
 So, the same things happened with vaccines, same thing.

2:06:37.080 --> 2:06:41.760
 So, people weren't talking about solutions to this problem because I don't think the

2:06:41.760 --> 2:06:43.160
 problem was bad enough.

2:06:43.160 --> 2:06:48.760
 When you talk about the war, I think our lives are too comfortable.

2:06:48.760 --> 2:06:55.120
 I think in the developed world, things are too good and we have not faced severe dangers.

2:06:55.120 --> 2:07:00.560
 When the dangers, the severe dangers existential threats are faced, that's when we step up.

2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:04.160
 On a small scale and a large scale.

2:07:04.160 --> 2:07:11.880
 Now, that's sort of my argument here, but I did think the virus, I was hoping that it

2:07:11.880 --> 2:07:18.160
 was actually sufficiently dangerous for us to step up because especially in the early

2:07:18.160 --> 2:07:19.800
 days, it was unclear.

2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:25.840
 It still is unclear because of mutations, how bad it might be.

2:07:25.840 --> 2:07:31.040
 So, I thought we would step up.

2:07:31.040 --> 2:07:37.840
 The mask's point is a tricky one because to me, the manufacture of masks isn't even the

2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:38.840
 problem.

2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:43.600
 I'm still to this day, and I was involved with a bunch of this work, have not seen good

2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:47.200
 signs done on whether masks work or not.

2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:49.480
 There still has not been a large scale study.

2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:55.200
 To me, there should be large scale studies on every possible solution, aggressive.

2:07:55.200 --> 2:07:59.400
 In the same way that the vaccine development was aggressive, there should be masks which

2:07:59.400 --> 2:08:04.160
 test what kind of tests work really well.

2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:09.040
 Even the question of how the virus spreads, there should be aggressive studies on that.

2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:14.400
 To understand, I'm still, as far as I know, there's still a lot of uncertainty about that.

2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:19.000
 Nobody wants to see this as an engineering problem that needs to be solved.

2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:21.840
 It's that I was surprised about.

2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:25.560
 We find that our views are largely convergent, but not completely.

2:08:25.560 --> 2:08:31.120
 So, I agree with the thing that because our society in some sense perceives itself as too

2:08:31.120 --> 2:08:38.960
 big to fail, and the virus did not alert people to the fact that we are facing possible failure

2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:41.640
 that basically put us into the postmodernist mode.

2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:45.320
 And I don't mean in a philosophical sense, but in a societal sense.

2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:50.000
 The difference between a postmodern society and the modern society is that the modernist

2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:53.840
 society has to deal with the ground tools, and the postmodernist society has to deal

2:08:53.840 --> 2:08:56.000
 with appearances.

2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:00.440
 Politics becomes a performance, and the performance is done for an audience, and the organized

2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:05.480
 audience is the media, and the media evaluates itself via other media.

2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:09.280
 So you have an audience of critics that evaluate themselves.

2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:12.680
 And I don't think it's so much the failure of the politicians because to get in power

2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:17.280
 and to stay in power, you need to be able to deal with the published opinion.

2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:23.600
 Well, I think it goes in cycles because what's going to happen is all of the small business

2:09:23.600 --> 2:09:29.440
 owners, all the people who truly are suffering and will suffer more because of the effects

2:09:29.440 --> 2:09:34.800
 of the closure of the economy and the lack of solutions to the virus, they're going

2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:36.640
 to a prize.

2:09:36.640 --> 2:09:42.760
 And hopefully, I mean, this is where charismatic leaders can get the world in trouble, but

2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:53.600
 hopefully will elect great leaders that will break through this postmodernist idea of the

2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:57.800
 media and the perception and the drama on Twitter and all that kind of stuff.

2:09:57.800 --> 2:09:59.760
 But you know this can go either way.

2:09:59.760 --> 2:10:00.760
 Yeah.

2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:06.560
 When the Weimar Republic was unable to deal with the economic crisis that Germany was

2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:09.320
 facing, there was an option to go back.

2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:14.600
 But there were people which thought, let's get back to a constitutional monarchy and

2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:19.080
 let's get this to work because democracy doesn't work.

2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:21.640
 And eventually, there was no way back.

2:10:21.640 --> 2:10:25.840
 When people decided there was no way back, they needed to go forward and the only options

2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:32.680
 for going forward was to become Stalinist communists, basically an option to completely

2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:40.080
 expropriate the factories and so on and nationalize them and to reorganize Germany in communist

2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:44.920
 terms and ally itself with Stalin and fascism.

2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:48.280
 And both options were obviously very bad.

2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:54.560
 And the one that the Germans picked led to a catastrophe that devastated Europe.

2:10:54.560 --> 2:10:58.080
 And I'm not sure if the US has an immune response against that.

2:10:58.080 --> 2:11:05.960
 I think that the far right is currently very weak in the US, but this can easily change.

2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:11.400
 Do you think from a historical perspective, Hitler could have been stopped from within

2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:14.160
 Germany or from outside?

2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:19.480
 Or this, well, depends on who you want to focus, whether you want to focus on Stalin

2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:20.480
 or Hitler.

2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:25.200
 But it feels like Hitler was the one as a political movement that could have been stopped.

2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:31.320
 I think that the point was that a lot of people wanted Hitler, so he got support from a lot

2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:32.320
 of quarters.

2:11:32.320 --> 2:11:36.760
 There was a number of industrialists who supported him because they thought that the democracy

2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:40.800
 is obviously not working in unstable and you need a strongman.

2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:43.360
 And he was willing to play that part.

2:11:43.360 --> 2:11:48.960
 There were also people in the US who thought that Hitler would stop Stalin and would act

2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:54.320
 as a bulwark against Bolshevism, which he probably would have done.

2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:56.520
 But at which cost?

2:11:56.520 --> 2:12:03.160
 And then many of the things that he was going to do, like the Holocaust, was something where

2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:04.760
 people thought this is rhetoric.

2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:10.240
 He's not actually going to do this, especially many of the Jews themselves, which were humanists.

2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:15.080
 And for them, this was outside of the scope that was thinkable.

2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:23.680
 I wonder if Hitler is uniquely, I want to carefully use this term, but uniquely evil.

2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:29.240
 So if Hitler was never born, if somebody else would come in his place.

2:12:29.240 --> 2:12:37.760
 So just thinking about the progress of history, how important are those singular figures that

2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:41.280
 lead to mass destruction and cruelty?

2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:47.680
 Because my sense is Hitler was unique.

2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:53.160
 It wasn't just about the environment and the context that gave him.

2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:57.600
 Another person would not come in his place to do as destructive of the things that he

2:12:57.600 --> 2:12:58.600
 did.

2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:07.040
 There was a combination of charisma, of madness, of psychopathy, of just ego, all those things

2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:12.640
 which are very unlikely to come together in one person in the right time.

2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:16.560
 It also depends on the context of the country that you're operating in.

2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:24.320
 If you tell the Germans that they have a historical destiny in this romantic country, the effect

2:13:24.320 --> 2:13:27.400
 is probably different than it is in other countries.

2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:33.880
 But Stalin has killed a few more people than Hitler did.

2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:40.800
 And if you look at the probability that you're survived under Stalin, Hitler killed people

2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:49.040
 if he thought they were not worth living, or if they were harmful to his racist project.

2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:55.040
 He basically felt that the Jews would be too cosmopolitan and would not be willing to participate

2:13:55.040 --> 2:14:00.520
 in the racist redefinition of society and the value of society in an ethno state in

2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:03.320
 this way, as he wanted it to have it.

2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:10.040
 So he saw them as a harmful danger, especially since they played such an important role in

2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:13.560
 the economy and culture of Germany.

2:14:13.560 --> 2:14:21.160
 And so he had basically had some radical, but rational reason to murder them.

2:14:21.160 --> 2:14:22.840
 And Stalin just killed everyone.

2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:30.840
 He basically, Stalin's purges were such a random thing where he said that there's a

2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:36.160
 certain possibility that this particular part of the population has a number of German collaborators

2:14:36.160 --> 2:14:37.920
 or something, and we just killed them all.

2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:43.800
 Right? Or if you look at what Mao did, the number of people that were killed in absolute

2:14:43.800 --> 2:14:47.760
 numbers were much higher than the Mao that there were under Stalin.

2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:50.360
 So it's super hard to say.

2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:55.360
 The other thing is that you look at Genghis Khan and so on, how many people he killed.

2:14:55.360 --> 2:15:00.800
 When you see there are a number of things that happen in human history that actually

2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:09.040
 put a substantial dent in the existing population or Napoleon, and it's very difficult to eventually

2:15:09.040 --> 2:15:16.440
 measure it because what's happening is basically evolution on a human scale where one monkey

2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:23.560
 figures out a way to become viral and is using this viral technology to change the patterns

2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:26.680
 of society at a very, very large scale.

2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:31.880
 And what we find so abhorrent about these changes is the complexity that is being destroyed

2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:32.880
 by this.

2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:36.680
 That it's basically like a big fire that burns out a lot of the existing culture and structure

2:15:36.680 --> 2:15:38.600
 that existed before.

2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:40.120
 Yeah.

2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:43.080
 And it all just starts with one monkey.

2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:46.120
 One charismatic ape, and there's a bunch of them throughout history.

2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:47.120
 Yeah.

2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:48.120
 But it's in a given environment.

2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:51.160
 It's basically similar to wildfires in California.

2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:53.400
 The temperature is rising.

2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:55.640
 There is less rain falling.

2:15:55.640 --> 2:16:00.920
 And then suddenly a single spark can have an effect that in other times would be contained.

2:16:00.920 --> 2:16:02.400
 Okay.

2:16:02.400 --> 2:16:11.880
 Speaking of which, I love how we went to Hitler and Stalin from 20, 30 minutes ago, GPT3 generating

2:16:11.880 --> 2:16:13.680
 doing programs that this is.

2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:19.800
 The argument was about morality of AI versus human.

2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:28.480
 So, and specifically in the context of writing programs, specifically in the context of programs

2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:30.000
 that can be destructive.

2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:35.200
 So running nuclear power plants or autonomous weapons systems, for example.

2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:41.720
 And I think your inclination was to say that it's not so obvious that AI would be less

2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:48.720
 moral than humans or less effective at making a world that would make humans happy.

2:16:48.720 --> 2:16:56.120
 So I'm not talking about self directed systems that are making their own goals at the global

2:16:56.120 --> 2:16:57.360
 scale.

2:16:57.360 --> 2:17:02.960
 If you just talk about the deployment of technological systems that are able to see

2:17:02.960 --> 2:17:08.520
 order and patterns and use this as control models to act on the goals that we give them.

2:17:08.520 --> 2:17:13.160
 Then if we have the correct incentives to set the correct incentives for these systems,

2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:15.520
 I'm quite optimistic.

2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:17.800
 So humans versus AI.

2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:21.120
 Let me give you an example.

2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:24.240
 Autonomous weapon system.

2:17:24.240 --> 2:17:30.880
 Let's say there's a city somewhere in the Middle East that has a number of terrorists.

2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:36.240
 And the question is what's currently done with drone technologies, you have information

2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:40.840
 about the location of a particular terrorist and you have a targeted attack, you have a

2:17:40.840 --> 2:17:44.280
 bombing of that particular building.

2:17:44.280 --> 2:17:49.160
 And that's all directed by humans at the high level strategy and also the deployment of

2:17:49.160 --> 2:17:55.560
 individual bombs and missiles like the actual, everything is done by human except the final

2:17:55.560 --> 2:18:00.520
 targeting and the, like the country, it's like the spot similar thing, like control

2:18:00.520 --> 2:18:01.920
 the flight.

2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:02.920
 Okay.

2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:11.520
 What if you give AI control and saying write a program that says here's the best information

2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:15.920
 available about the location of these five terrorists, here's the city.

2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:19.600
 Make sure it's all the bombing you do is constrained to the city.

2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:22.920
 Make sure it's precision based, but you take care of it.

2:18:22.920 --> 2:18:29.920
 So you do one level of abstraction out and saying take care of the terrorist in the city.

2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:35.600
 Which are you more comfortable with the humans or the JavaScript GPT three generated code

2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:38.200
 that's doing the deployment?

2:18:38.200 --> 2:18:45.960
 I mean, that's, this is the kind of question I'm asking is the kind of bugs that we see

2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:51.360
 in human nature, are they better or worse than the kind of bugs we see in AI?

2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:52.360
 They're different bugs.

2:18:52.360 --> 2:19:00.680
 There is an issue that if people are creating an imperfect automation of a process that normally

2:19:00.680 --> 2:19:07.080
 requires a mobile judgment, and this mobile judgment is the reason why it cannot be automated

2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:13.560
 often is not because the computation is too expensive, but because the model that you give

2:19:13.560 --> 2:19:19.240
 the AI is not an adequate model of the dynamics of the world, because the AI does not understand

2:19:19.240 --> 2:19:22.120
 the context that it's operating in the right way.

2:19:22.120 --> 2:19:26.160
 And this is something that already happens with Excel, where you don't need to have an

2:19:26.160 --> 2:19:32.160
 AI system to do this, if you have an automated process in place, where humans decide using

2:19:32.160 --> 2:19:37.480
 automated criteria whom to kill when, and whom to target when, which already happens.

2:19:37.480 --> 2:19:38.480
 Right.

2:19:38.480 --> 2:19:42.800
 And you have no way to get off the kill list once that happens, once you have been targeted

2:19:42.800 --> 2:19:48.480
 according to some automatic criterion by people, right, in a bureaucracy.

2:19:48.480 --> 2:19:49.480
 That is the issue.

2:19:49.480 --> 2:19:52.480
 The issue is not the AI, it's the automation.

2:19:52.480 --> 2:19:59.120
 So there's something about, right, it's automation, but there's something about the, there's a

2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:04.800
 certain level of abstraction where you give control to AI to do the automation.

2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:10.800
 There's a scale that could be achieved that it feels like the scale of bug and scale mistake

2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:17.080
 and scale of destruction that could be achieved of the kind that humans cannot achieve.

2:20:17.080 --> 2:20:22.680
 So AI is much more able to destroy an entire country accidentally versus humans.

2:20:22.680 --> 2:20:31.160
 It feels like the more civilians die as a react or suffer as a consequence of your decisions,

2:20:31.160 --> 2:20:36.600
 the more weight there is on the human mind to make that decision.

2:20:36.600 --> 2:20:41.600
 And so like it becomes more and more unlikely to make that decision for humans.

2:20:41.600 --> 2:20:47.160
 For AI, it feels like it's harder to encode that kind of weight.

2:20:47.160 --> 2:20:52.480
 In a way, the AI that we're currently building is automating statistics, right, intelligence

2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:55.400
 is the ability to make models so you can act on them.

2:20:55.400 --> 2:20:58.560
 And AI is a tool to make better models.

2:20:58.560 --> 2:21:04.520
 So in principle, if you're using AI wisely, you're able to prevent more harm.

2:21:04.520 --> 2:21:08.800
 And I think that the main issue is not on the side of the AI, it's on the side of the

2:21:08.800 --> 2:21:12.440
 human command hierarchy that is using technology irresponsibly.

2:21:12.440 --> 2:21:18.320
 So the question is how hard is it to encode, to properly encode the right incentives into

2:21:18.320 --> 2:21:19.320
 the AI?

2:21:19.320 --> 2:21:24.480
 And for instance, there's this idea of what happens if we let our airplanes being flown

2:21:24.480 --> 2:21:28.280
 with AI systems and the neural network is a black box and so on.

2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:32.440
 And it turns out our neural networks are actually not black boxes anymore.

2:21:32.440 --> 2:21:38.600
 There are function approximators losing linear algebra, and there are performing things that

2:21:38.600 --> 2:21:40.200
 we can understand.

2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:44.920
 But we can also, instead of letting the neural network fly the airplane, use the neural network

2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:47.600
 to generate a proof of the correct program.

2:21:47.600 --> 2:21:52.080
 It's a degree of accuracy of the proof that a human could not achieve.

2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:56.920
 So we can use our AI by combining different technologies to build systems that are much

2:21:56.920 --> 2:22:00.680
 more reliable than the systems that a human being could create.

2:22:00.680 --> 2:22:07.760
 And so in this sense, I would say that if you use an early stage of technology to save

2:22:07.760 --> 2:22:13.240
 labor and don't employ competent people, but just to hack something together because

2:22:13.240 --> 2:22:15.400
 you can, that is very dangerous.

2:22:15.400 --> 2:22:20.400
 And if people are acting under these incentives that they get away with delivering shoddy work

2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:24.200
 more cheaply using AI is less human oversight than before.

2:22:24.200 --> 2:22:25.200
 That's very dangerous.

2:22:25.200 --> 2:22:30.560
 The thing is though, AI is still going to be unreliable, perhaps less willing humans,

2:22:30.560 --> 2:22:34.200
 but it'll be unreliable in novel ways.

2:22:34.200 --> 2:22:37.360
 And yeah, but this is an empirical question.

2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:40.040
 And it's something that we can figure out and work with.

2:22:40.040 --> 2:22:45.520
 So the issue is, do we trust the systems, the social systems that we have in place and

2:22:45.520 --> 2:22:50.560
 the social systems that we can build and maintain, that they're able to use AI responsibly?

2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:53.120
 If they can, then AI is good news.

2:22:53.120 --> 2:22:56.640
 If they cannot, then it's going to make the existing problems worse.

2:22:56.640 --> 2:23:01.680
 Well, and also who creates the AI, who controls it, who makes money from it, because it's

2:23:01.680 --> 2:23:03.400
 ultimately humans.

2:23:03.400 --> 2:23:07.080
 And then you start talking about how much you trust the humans.

2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:08.800
 So the question is, what does who mean?

2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:11.200
 I don't think that we have identity per se.

2:23:11.200 --> 2:23:15.680
 I think that the story of a human being is somewhat random.

2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:20.000
 What happens is more or less that everybody is acting on their local incentives, what

2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:22.200
 they perceive to be their incentives.

2:23:22.200 --> 2:23:27.520
 And the question is, what are the incentives that the one that is pressing the button is

2:23:27.520 --> 2:23:29.520
 operating under?

2:23:29.520 --> 2:23:30.520
 Yeah.

2:23:30.520 --> 2:23:32.800
 It's nice for those incentives to be transparent.

2:23:32.800 --> 2:23:42.520
 So for example, I'll give you example, there seems to be a significant distrust of a tech,

2:23:42.520 --> 2:23:47.320
 like entrepreneurs in the tech space or people that run, for example, social media companies

2:23:47.320 --> 2:23:50.240
 like Mark Zuckerberg.

2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:59.040
 There's not a complete transparency of incentives under which that particular human being operates.

2:23:59.040 --> 2:24:03.160
 We can listen to the words he says or what the marketing team says for a company, but

2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:04.400
 we don't know.

2:24:04.400 --> 2:24:12.800
 And that becomes a problem when the algorithms and the systems created by him and other people

2:24:12.800 --> 2:24:19.760
 in that company start having more and more impact on society.

2:24:19.760 --> 2:24:26.080
 If the incentives were somehow the definition and the explainability of the incentives

2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:36.000
 was decentralized such that nobody can manipulate it, no propaganda type manipulation of how

2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:45.440
 these systems actually operate could be done, then yes, I think AI could achieve much fairer,

2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:53.440
 much more effective solutions to difficult ethical problems.

2:24:53.440 --> 2:25:00.560
 But when there's like humans in the loop manipulating the dissemination, the communication

2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:05.440
 of how the system actually works, that feels like you can run into a lot of trouble.

2:25:05.440 --> 2:25:10.120
 And that's why there's currently a lot of distrust for people at the heads of companies

2:25:10.120 --> 2:25:13.880
 that have increasingly powerful AI systems.

2:25:13.880 --> 2:25:19.040
 I suspect what happened traditionally in the US was that since our decision making is much

2:25:19.040 --> 2:25:24.720
 more decentralized than in an authoritarian state, people are making decisions autonomously

2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:27.080
 at many, many levels in the society.

2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:33.440
 What happened was we created coherence and cohesion in society by controlling what people

2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:35.800
 thought and what information they had.

2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:38.840
 The media synchronized public opinion.

2:25:38.840 --> 2:25:40.480
 And social media have disrupted this.

2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:44.760
 It's not, I think, so much Russian influence or something.

2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:45.760
 Everybody's influence.

2:25:45.760 --> 2:25:52.680
 But a random person can come up with a conspiracy theory and disrupt what people think.

2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:58.440
 And if that conspiracy theory is more compelling or more attractive than the standardized public

2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:03.520
 conspiracy theory that we give people as a default, then it might get more traction.

2:26:03.520 --> 2:26:08.280
 You suddenly have the situation that a single individual somewhere on a farm in Texas has

2:26:08.280 --> 2:26:11.280
 more listeners than CNN.

2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:16.040
 Which particular farmer you're referring to in Texas?

2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:18.040
 Probably no.

2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:21.480
 Yes, I had dinner with him a couple of times.

2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:22.480
 Okay.

2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:23.480
 Right.

2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:26.160
 This is an interesting situation because you cannot get to be an anchor in CNN if you

2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:30.520
 don't go through a complicated gatekeeping process.

2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:35.920
 And suddenly you have random people without that gatekeeping process just optimizing for

2:26:35.920 --> 2:26:36.920
 attention.

2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:42.160
 And not necessarily with a lot of responsibility for the long term effects of projecting these

2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:44.040
 theories into the public.

2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:48.920
 And now there is a push of making social media more like traditional media, which means that

2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:54.640
 the opinion that is being projected in social media is more limited to an acceptable range

2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:59.880
 with the goal of getting society into safe waters and increase the stability and cohesion

2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:03.280
 of society again, which I think is a laudable goal.

2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:08.560
 And of course, it also is an opportunity to cease the means of indoctrination.

2:27:08.560 --> 2:27:15.560
 And the incentives that people are under when they do this in such a way that the AI ethics

2:27:15.560 --> 2:27:21.920
 that we would need becomes very often something like AI politics, which is basically partisan

2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:23.480
 and ideological.

2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:28.440
 And this means that whatever one side says, another side is going to be disagreeing with.

2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:33.400
 In the same way as when you turn masks or the vaccine into a political issue, if you

2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:37.760
 say that it is politically virtuous to get vaccinated, it will mean that the people that

2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:41.160
 don't like you will not want to get vaccinated.

2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:46.600
 And as soon as you have this partisan discourse, it's going to be very hard to make the right

2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:48.920
 decisions because the incentives get to be the wrong ones.

2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:51.200
 AI ethics needs to be super boring.

2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:56.720
 It needs to be done by people who do statistics all the time and have extremely boring, long

2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:01.000
 winded discussions that most people cannot follow because they are too complicated but

2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:02.640
 that are dead serious.

2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:07.240
 These people need to be able to be better at statistics than the leading machine learning

2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:08.240
 researchers.

2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:13.160
 And at the moment, the AI ethics debate is the one where you don't have any barrier to

2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:14.960
 entry, right?

2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:18.840
 Everybody who has a strong opinion and is able to signal that opinion in the right way

2:28:18.840 --> 2:28:19.840
 can enter it.

2:28:19.840 --> 2:28:22.280
 Strong words to judge it back.

2:28:22.280 --> 2:28:27.000
 To me, that is a very frustrating thing because the field is so crucially important to our

2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:28.000
 future.

2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:29.000
 It's so crucially important.

2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:33.600
 But the only qualification you currently need is to be outraged by the injustice in

2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:34.600
 the world.

2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:36.680
 It's more complicated, right?

2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:37.680
 Everybody seems to be outraged.

2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:42.120
 So let's just say that the incentives are not always the right ones.

2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:48.200
 So basically, I suspect that a lot of people that enter this debate don't have a vision

2:28:48.200 --> 2:28:52.400
 for what society should be looking like in a way that is nonviolent, where we preserve

2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:58.840
 liberal democracy, where we make sure that we all get along and we are around in a few

2:28:58.840 --> 2:29:03.840
 hundred years from now, preferably with the comfortable technological civilization around

2:29:03.840 --> 2:29:04.840
 us.

2:29:04.840 --> 2:29:12.480
 I generally have a very foggy view of that world, but I tend to try to follow and I think

2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:18.000
 society should in some degree follow the gradient of love, increasing the amount of love in

2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:19.240
 the world.

2:29:19.240 --> 2:29:26.120
 And whenever I see different policies or algorithms or ideas that are not doing so, obviously,

2:29:26.120 --> 2:29:28.080
 that's the ones that kind of resist.

2:29:28.080 --> 2:29:34.120
 So the thing that terrifies me about this notion is I think that German fascism was driven

2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:35.120
 by love.

2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:38.000
 It was just a very selective love.

2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:39.000
 It was a love that basically…

2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:40.520
 Well, now you're just manipulating.

2:29:40.520 --> 2:29:46.080
 I mean, that's, you have to be very careful.

2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:50.680
 You're talking to the wrong person in this way about love.

2:29:50.680 --> 2:29:52.680
 So let's talk about what love is.

2:29:52.680 --> 2:29:56.120
 And I think that love is the discovery of shared purpose.

2:29:56.120 --> 2:29:59.800
 It's the recognition of the sacred and the other.

2:29:59.800 --> 2:30:03.040
 And this enables nontransactual interactions.

2:30:03.040 --> 2:30:09.880
 But the size of the other that you include needs to be maximized.

2:30:09.880 --> 2:30:24.120
 So it's basically appreciation, like deep appreciation of the world around you fully,

2:30:24.120 --> 2:30:28.000
 including the people that are very different than you, people that disagree with you completely,

2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:33.560
 including people, including living creatures outside of just people, including ideas and

2:30:33.560 --> 2:30:42.160
 appreciation of the full mess of it and also has to do with empathy, which is coupled with

2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:47.200
 a lack of confidence and certainty of your own rightness.

2:30:47.200 --> 2:30:51.040
 It's like a radical open mindedness to the way forward.

2:30:51.040 --> 2:30:53.480
 I agree with every part of what you said.

2:30:53.480 --> 2:30:59.040
 And now, if you scale it up, what you recognize is that love is, in some sense, the service

2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:04.280
 to a next level agency, to the highest level agency that you can recognize.

2:31:04.280 --> 2:31:10.200
 It could be, for instance, life on earth or beyond that, where you could say intelligent

2:31:10.200 --> 2:31:14.200
 complexity in the universe that you try to maximize in a certain way.

2:31:14.200 --> 2:31:19.120
 But when you think it's true, it basically means a certain aesthetic.

2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:22.800
 And there is not one possible aesthetic, there are many possible aesthetics.

2:31:22.800 --> 2:31:28.560
 And once you project an aesthetic into the future, you can see that there are some which

2:31:28.560 --> 2:31:33.920
 affect from it, which are in conflict with it, that are corrupt, that are evil.

2:31:33.920 --> 2:31:38.840
 You and me would probably agree that Hitler was evil, because the aesthetic of the world

2:31:38.840 --> 2:31:44.840
 that he wanted is in conflict with the aesthetic of the world that you and me have in mind.

2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:51.280
 And so the thing that he destroyed, we want to keep them in the world.

2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:58.040
 There's a kind of ways to deal, I mean, Hitler's an easier case, but perhaps he wasn't so easy

2:31:58.040 --> 2:32:03.200
 in the 30s, to understand who's Hitler and who's not before he was there.

2:32:03.200 --> 2:32:06.680
 No, it's just that there was no consensus that the aesthetics that he had in mind were

2:32:06.680 --> 2:32:07.680
 unacceptable.

2:32:07.680 --> 2:32:08.680
 Yeah.

2:32:08.680 --> 2:32:11.240
 I mean, it's difficult.

2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:19.280
 Love is complicated, because you can't just be so open minded that you let evil walk into

2:32:19.280 --> 2:32:29.800
 the door, but you can't be so self assured that you can always identify evil perfectly,

2:32:29.800 --> 2:32:34.960
 because that's what leads to Nazi Germany, having a certainty of what is and wasn't evil,

2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:38.920
 like always drawing lines of good versus evil.

2:32:38.920 --> 2:32:51.520
 There has to be a dance between hard stances extending up against what is wrong, and at

2:32:51.520 --> 2:32:59.680
 the same time, empathy and open mindedness towards not knowing what is right and wrong,

2:32:59.680 --> 2:33:01.400
 and a dance between those.

2:33:01.400 --> 2:33:05.960
 I found that when I watched the Miyazaki movies that there is nobody who captures my spirituality

2:33:05.960 --> 2:33:07.480
 as well as he does.

2:33:07.480 --> 2:33:10.720
 It's very interesting, and just wishes.

2:33:10.720 --> 2:33:14.320
 There is something going on in his movies that is very interesting.

2:33:14.320 --> 2:33:21.480
 For instance, Mononoka is discussing not only an answer to Disney's simplistic notion

2:33:21.480 --> 2:33:26.720
 of Mowgli, the jungle boy who was raised by wolves, and as soon as he sees people realizes

2:33:26.720 --> 2:33:34.240
 that he's one of them, and the way in which the moral life and nature is simplified and

2:33:34.240 --> 2:33:40.440
 romanticized and turned into kitsch is disgusting in the Disney movie, and he answers to this.

2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:44.600
 He's replaced by Mononoka, this wolf girl who was raised by wolves and who was fierce

2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:50.000
 and dangerous, and who cannot be socialized because she cannot be tamed, cannot be part

2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:51.000
 of human society.

2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:54.240
 You see, human society, it's something that is very, very complicated.

2:33:54.240 --> 2:34:01.360
 You see people extracting resources and destroying nature, but the purpose is not to be evil,

2:34:01.360 --> 2:34:07.400
 but to be able to have a life that is free from, for instance, oppression and violence

2:34:07.400 --> 2:34:11.600
 and to curb death and disease.

2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:15.280
 You basically see this conflict which cannot be resolved in a certain way.

2:34:15.280 --> 2:34:19.800
 You see this moment when nature is turned into a garden, and it loses most of what it

2:34:19.800 --> 2:34:24.960
 actually is, and humans no longer submitting to life and death and nature.

2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:29.160
 To these questions, there is no easy answer, so it just turns it into something that is

2:34:29.160 --> 2:34:35.040
 being observed as a journey that happens and that happens with a certain degree of inevitability,

2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:39.000
 and the nice thing about all his movies is there is a certain main character, and it's

2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.360
 the same in all movies.

2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:48.240
 It's this little girl that is basically Heidi, and I suspect that happened because when he

2:34:48.240 --> 2:34:54.760
 did field work for working on the Heidi movies back then, the Heidi animations, before he

2:34:54.760 --> 2:35:01.160
 did his own movies, he traveled to Switzerland, and South Eastern Europe, and the Adriatic

2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:05.920
 and so on, and got an idea about a certain aesthetic and a certain way of life that informed

2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:08.400
 his future thinking.

2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:12.960
 Heidi has a very interesting relationship to herself and to the world.

2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:16.000
 There is nothing that she takes for herself.

2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:21.160
 She is in a way fearless because she is committed to a service, to a greater whole.

2:35:21.160 --> 2:35:23.840
 Basically she is completely committed to serving God.

2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:26.320
 It's not an institutionalized God.

2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:30.520
 It has nothing to do with the Roman Catholic Church or something like this.

2:35:30.520 --> 2:35:36.160
 But in some sense, Heidi is an embodiment of the spirit of Protestantism.

2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:42.000
 This idea of a being that is completely perfect and pure, and it's not a feminist vision

2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:48.760
 because she is not a girl boss or something like this.

2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:54.320
 She is the justification for the man in the audience to protect her, to build the civilization

2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:56.760
 around her that makes her possible.

2:35:56.760 --> 2:36:02.800
 She is not just the sacrifice of Jesus who is innocent and therefore, nailed to the cross.

2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:04.080
 She is not being sacrificed.

2:36:04.080 --> 2:36:08.640
 She is being protected by everybody around her who recognizes that she is sacred and

2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:12.640
 there are enough around her to see that.

2:36:12.640 --> 2:36:14.080
 This is a very interesting perspective.

2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:18.560
 There is a certain notion of innocence, and this notion of innocence is not universal.

2:36:18.560 --> 2:36:20.240
 It's not in all cultures.

2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:21.560
 Hitler wasn't innocent.

2:36:21.560 --> 2:36:26.960
 His idea of Germany was not that there is an innocence that is being protected.

2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:29.800
 There was a predator that was going to triumph.

2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:32.280
 And it's also something that is not at the core of every religion.

2:36:32.280 --> 2:36:34.920
 There are many religions which don't care about innocence.

2:36:34.920 --> 2:36:41.160
 They might care about increasing the status of something.

2:36:41.160 --> 2:36:46.840
 And that's a very interesting notion that is quite unique and not claiming it's the

2:36:46.840 --> 2:36:47.840
 optimal one.

2:36:47.840 --> 2:36:53.480
 It has a particular kind of aesthetic, which I think makes Miyazaki into the most relevant

2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:55.600
 Protestant philosopher today.

2:36:55.600 --> 2:37:01.960
 And you're saying in terms of all the ways that society can operate, perhaps the preservation

2:37:01.960 --> 2:37:06.680
 of innocence might be one of the best?

2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:09.840
 No, it's just my aesthetic.

2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:10.840
 Your aesthetic.

2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:15.440
 It's a particular way in which I feel that I relate to the world, that is natural to

2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:22.400
 my own socialization, and maybe it's not an accident that I have cultural roots in Europe,

2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:24.080
 in a particular world.

2:37:24.080 --> 2:37:28.400
 So maybe it's a natural convergence point, and it's not something that you will find

2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:31.080
 in all other times in history.

2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:37.960
 So I'd like to ask you about Solzhenitsyn and our individual role as ants in this very

2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:39.520
 large society.

2:37:39.520 --> 2:37:43.560
 So he says that some version of the line between good and evil runs to the heart of

2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:44.560
 every man.

2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:49.000
 Do you think all of us are capable of good and evil?

2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:55.680
 What's our role in this play in this game we're all playing?

2:37:55.680 --> 2:37:59.240
 Is all of us capable to play any role?

2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:06.040
 Is there an ultimate responsibility to, you mentioned, maintaining innocence or whatever

2:38:06.040 --> 2:38:11.640
 the highest ideal for society you want, are all of us capable of living up to that?

2:38:11.640 --> 2:38:16.440
 And that's our responsibility, or is there significant limitations to what we're able

2:38:16.440 --> 2:38:21.480
 to do in terms of good and evil?

2:38:21.480 --> 2:38:27.320
 So there is a certain way, if you are not terrible, if you are committed to some kind

2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:32.240
 of civilizational agency, a next level agent that you are serving, some kind of transcendent

2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:34.320
 principle.

2:38:34.320 --> 2:38:38.360
 In the eyes of that transcendental principle, you are able to discern good from evil, otherwise

2:38:38.360 --> 2:38:41.120
 you cannot, otherwise you have just individual aesthetics.

2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:46.400
 The cat that is torturing a mouse is not evil, because the cat does not envision or

2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:53.840
 not part of the cat is envisioning a world where there is no violence and nobody is suffering.

2:38:53.840 --> 2:38:58.800
 If you have an aesthetic where you want to protect innocence, then torturing somebody

2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:02.200
 needlessly is evil, but only then.

2:39:02.200 --> 2:39:09.000
 No, but within, I guess the question is within the aesthetic, within your sense of what is

2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:16.640
 good and evil, we're still, it seems like we're still able to commit evil.

2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:17.640
 Yes.

2:39:17.640 --> 2:39:21.960
 So basically, if you are committing to this next level agent, you are not necessarily

2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:23.640
 are this next level agent, right?

2:39:23.640 --> 2:39:24.640
 You are part of it.

2:39:24.640 --> 2:39:29.920
 You have a relationship to it, like a cell does to its organism, its hyperorganism.

2:39:29.920 --> 2:39:34.840
 And it only exists to the degree that it's being implemented by you and others.

2:39:34.840 --> 2:39:38.680
 And that means that you're not completely fully serving it.

2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:42.520
 You have freedom in what you decide, whether you are acting on your impulses and local

2:39:42.520 --> 2:39:47.400
 incentives and your verbal impulses, so to speak, or whether you're committing to it.

2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:53.360
 And what you perceive then is a tension between what you would be doing with respect to the

2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:59.000
 thing that you recognize as the sacred, if you do, and what you're actually doing.

2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:03.080
 And this is the line between good and evil, right, where you see, oh, I'm here acting

2:40:03.080 --> 2:40:08.160
 on my local incentives or impulses, and here I'm acting on what I consider to be sacred

2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:09.960
 and there's a tension between those.

2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:14.600
 And this is the line between good and evil that might run through your heart.

2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:18.000
 And if you don't have that, if you don't have this relationship to a transcendental

2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:21.840
 agent, you could call this relationship to the next level agent soul, right?

2:40:21.840 --> 2:40:22.840
 It's not a thing.

2:40:22.840 --> 2:40:25.960
 It's not an immortal thing that is intrinsically valuable.

2:40:25.960 --> 2:40:30.040
 It's a certain kind of relationship that you project to understand what's happening.

2:40:30.040 --> 2:40:33.360
 Somebody is serving this transcendental sacredness or they're not.

2:40:33.360 --> 2:40:36.040
 If you don't have a soul, you cannot be evil.

2:40:36.040 --> 2:40:39.200
 You're addressed a complex natural phenomenon.

2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:46.280
 So if you look at life, like starting today or starting tomorrow, when we leave here today,

2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:53.960
 there's a bunch of trajectories that you can take through life, maybe countless.

2:40:53.960 --> 2:41:00.360
 Do you think some of these trajectories, in your own conception of yourself, some of those

2:41:00.360 --> 2:41:04.320
 trajectories are the ideal life?

2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:10.840
 A life that if you were to be the hero of your life story, you would want to be.

2:41:10.840 --> 2:41:14.080
 Look, is there some Joshua Bach that you're striving to be?

2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:20.240
 Like this is the question I ask myself as an individual trying to make a better world

2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:22.760
 in the best way that I could conceive of.

2:41:22.760 --> 2:41:25.080
 What is my responsibility there?

2:41:25.080 --> 2:41:28.440
 And how much am I responsible for the failure to do so?

2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:35.880
 Because I'm lazy and incompetent too often in my own perception.

2:41:35.880 --> 2:41:38.440
 In my own world view, I'm not very important.

2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:43.480
 So I don't have place for me as a hero in my own world.

2:41:43.480 --> 2:41:48.320
 I'm trying to do the best that I can, which is often not very good.

2:41:48.320 --> 2:41:55.720
 And so it's not important for me to have status or to be seen in a particular way.

2:41:55.720 --> 2:41:59.800
 It's helpful if others can see me, if a few people can see me, that can be my friends.

2:41:59.800 --> 2:42:00.800
 No, sorry.

2:42:00.800 --> 2:42:01.800
 I want to clarify.

2:42:01.800 --> 2:42:10.400
 The hero didn't mean status or perception or some kind of marketing thing, but more

2:42:10.400 --> 2:42:14.200
 in private, in the quiet of your own mind.

2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:19.680
 Is there the kind of man you want to be and would consider it a failure if you don't become

2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:20.680
 that?

2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:21.920
 That's what I meant by hero.

2:42:21.920 --> 2:42:22.920
 Yeah, not really.

2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:28.760
 I don't perceive myself as having such an identity.

2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:32.480
 And it's also sometimes frustrating.

2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:44.200
 But it's basically a lack of having this notion of father that I need to be emulating.

2:42:44.200 --> 2:42:45.200
 It's interesting.

2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:48.760
 I mean, it's the leaf floating down the river.

2:42:48.760 --> 2:42:59.080
 I worry that sometimes it's more like being the river.

2:42:59.080 --> 2:43:12.280
 I'm just a fat frog sitting on a leaf on a dirty, muddy lake waiting for a princess to

2:43:12.280 --> 2:43:13.280
 kiss me.

2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:14.280
 Or the other way.

2:43:14.280 --> 2:43:16.160
 I forgot which way it goes.

2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:19.280
 Maybe he kisses somebody.

2:43:19.280 --> 2:43:24.880
 Can I ask you, I don't know if you know who Michael Malis is, but in terms of constructing

2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:28.960
 systems of incentives, it's interesting to ask.

2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:33.200
 I don't think I've talked to you about this before.

2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:35.840
 Malis espouses anarchism.

2:43:35.840 --> 2:43:42.840
 So he sees all government as fundamentally getting in the way or even being destructive

2:43:42.840 --> 2:43:49.960
 to collaborations between human beings thriving.

2:43:49.960 --> 2:43:50.960
 What do you think?

2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:57.040
 What's the role of government in a society that thrives?

2:43:57.040 --> 2:44:00.880
 Is anarchism at all compelling to you as a system?

2:44:00.880 --> 2:44:04.880
 So not just small government, but no government at all.

2:44:04.880 --> 2:44:09.920
 Yeah, I don't see how this would work.

2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:15.080
 The government is an agent that imposes an offset on your reward function, on your payout

2:44:15.080 --> 2:44:20.960
 metrics, so your behavior becomes compatible with the common good.

2:44:20.960 --> 2:44:27.800
 So the argument there is that you can have collectives, like governing organizations,

2:44:27.800 --> 2:44:33.120
 but not government, like where you're born in a particular set of land, and therefore

2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:38.560
 you must follow this rule or else.

2:44:38.560 --> 2:44:45.040
 You're forced by what they call violence because there's an implied violence here.

2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:54.600
 So the key aspect of government is it protects you from the rest of the world with an army

2:44:54.600 --> 2:44:56.800
 and with police.

2:44:56.800 --> 2:45:00.200
 So it has a monopoly on violence.

2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:02.040
 It's the only one that's able to do violence.

2:45:02.040 --> 2:45:03.640
 So there are many forms of government.

2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:10.280
 Not all governments do that, but we find that in successful countries, the government has

2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:13.040
 a monopoly on violence.

2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:17.720
 And that means that you cannot get ahead by starting your own army because the government

2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:21.080
 will come down on you and destroy you if you try to do that.

2:45:21.080 --> 2:45:24.840
 And in countries where you can build your own army and get away with it, some people

2:45:24.840 --> 2:45:25.840
 will do it.

2:45:25.840 --> 2:45:30.280
 And these countries is what we call failed countries in a way.

2:45:30.280 --> 2:45:35.900
 And if you don't want to have violence, the point is not to appeal to the moral intentions

2:45:35.900 --> 2:45:41.560
 of people because some people will use strategies if they get ahead with them that feel a particular

2:45:41.560 --> 2:45:42.800
 kind of ecological niche.

2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:45.400
 So you need to destroy that ecological niche.

2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:51.960
 And if an effective government has a monopoly on violence, it can create a world where nobody

2:45:51.960 --> 2:45:54.840
 is able to use violence and get ahead.

2:45:54.840 --> 2:45:59.520
 So you want to use that monopoly on violence not to exert violence, but to make violence

2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:02.280
 impossible, to raise the cost of violence.

2:46:02.280 --> 2:46:06.200
 So people need to get ahead with nonviolent means.

2:46:06.200 --> 2:46:12.320
 So the idea is that you might be able to achieve that in an anarchist state with companies.

2:46:12.320 --> 2:46:19.640
 So with the forces of capitalism is create security companies where the one that's most

2:46:19.640 --> 2:46:24.280
 ethically sound rises to the top, basically, it would be a much better representative of

2:46:24.280 --> 2:46:33.400
 the people because there is less sort of stickiness to the big military force sticking around,

2:46:33.400 --> 2:46:35.400
 even though it's long outlived.

2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:41.640
 So you have groups of militants that are hopefully officially organized because otherwise they're

2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:44.720
 going to lose against the other groups of militants.

2:46:44.720 --> 2:46:50.000
 And they are coordinating themselves with the rest of society until they are having

2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:51.280
 a monopoly on violence.

2:46:51.280 --> 2:46:53.440
 How is that different for a government?

2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:56.280
 So it's basically converging to the same thing.

2:46:56.280 --> 2:47:00.600
 So I think it always, in my, as I was trying to argue with Malice, I feel like it always

2:47:00.600 --> 2:47:03.200
 converges towards government at scale.

2:47:03.200 --> 2:47:08.360
 But I think the idea is you can have a lot of collectives that are, you basically never

2:47:08.360 --> 2:47:11.920
 let anything scale too big.

2:47:11.920 --> 2:47:19.280
 So one of the problems with governments is it gets too big in terms of the size of the

2:47:19.280 --> 2:47:24.040
 group over which it has control.

2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:27.160
 My sense is that would happen anyway.

2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:34.280
 So a successful company like Amazon or Facebook, I mean, it starts forming a monopoly over

2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:39.440
 entire populations, not over just hundreds of millions, but billions of people.

2:47:39.440 --> 2:47:45.960
 So I don't know, but there is something about the abuses of power the government can have

2:47:45.960 --> 2:47:49.080
 when it has a monopoly on violence, right?

2:47:49.080 --> 2:47:51.880
 And so that's, that's attention there.

2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:56.560
 But so the question is, how can you set the incentives for government correctly?

2:47:56.560 --> 2:48:00.240
 And this mostly applies at the highest levels of government.

2:48:00.240 --> 2:48:04.080
 And we, because we haven't found a way to set them correctly, we made the highest levels

2:48:04.080 --> 2:48:06.440
 of government relatively weak.

2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:10.840
 And this is, I think, part of the reason why we had difficulty to coordinate the pandemic

2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:12.440
 response.

2:48:12.440 --> 2:48:15.160
 And China didn't have that much difficulty.

2:48:15.160 --> 2:48:19.880
 And there is, of course, a much higher risk of the abuse of power that exists in China

2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:23.000
 because the power is largely unchecked.

2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:26.880
 And that's basically what happens in the next generation, for instance.

2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:30.520
 Imagine that we would agree that the current government of China is largely correct and

2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:31.600
 by never limit.

2:48:31.600 --> 2:48:36.880
 And maybe we don't agree on this, but if we did, how can we make sure that this stays

2:48:36.880 --> 2:48:37.880
 like this?

2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:42.840
 And if you don't have checks and balances and division of power, it's hard to achieve.

2:48:42.840 --> 2:48:45.480
 You don't have a solution for that problem.

2:48:45.480 --> 2:48:49.680
 But the abolishment of government basically would remove the control structure.

2:48:49.680 --> 2:48:55.440
 From a cybernetic perspective, there is an optimal point in the system that the regulation

2:48:55.440 --> 2:49:00.520
 should be happening, where you can measure the current incentives, and the regulator

2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:05.360
 would probably incentivize to make the right decisions and change the payout metrics of

2:49:05.360 --> 2:49:10.000
 everything below it in such a way that the local prisoner's dilemmas get resolved.

2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:15.240
 You cannot resolve the prisoner's dilemma without some kind of eternal control that

2:49:15.240 --> 2:49:18.120
 emulates an infinite game in a way.

2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:19.120
 Yeah.

2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:25.960
 I mean, there is a sense in which it seems like the reason the parts of government that

2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:35.240
 don't work well currently is because there's not good mechanisms through which to interact

2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:37.280
 for the citizenry to interact with government.

2:49:37.280 --> 2:49:41.680
 It's basically, it hasn't caught up in terms of technology.

2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:47.320
 And I think once you integrate some of the digital revolution of being able to have a

2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:53.680
 lot of access to data, be able to vote on different ideas at a local level, at all levels,

2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:58.840
 at the optimal level, like you're saying, that can resolve the prisoner dilemmas.

2:49:58.840 --> 2:50:05.840
 And to integrate AI to help you out, automate things that don't require the human ingenuity

2:50:05.840 --> 2:50:12.200
 – I feel like that's where government can operate that well – and can also break

2:50:12.200 --> 2:50:15.000
 apart the inefficient bureaucracies if needed.

2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:20.720
 There'll be a strong incentive to be efficient and successful.

2:50:20.720 --> 2:50:25.800
 So out human history, we see an evolutionary competition of modes of government and of

2:50:25.800 --> 2:50:28.280
 individual governments is in these modes.

2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:32.560
 And every nation state in some sense is some kind of organism that has found different

2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:35.280
 solutions for the problem of government.

2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:38.760
 And you could look at all these different models and the different scales at which it

2:50:38.760 --> 2:50:45.880
 exists as empirical attempts to validate the idea of how to build a better government.

2:50:45.880 --> 2:50:52.720
 And I suspect that the idea of anarchism, similar to the idea of communism, is the result

2:50:52.720 --> 2:50:58.000
 of being disenchanted with the ugliness of the real existing solutions and the attempt

2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:01.040
 to get to an utopia.

2:51:01.040 --> 2:51:04.480
 And I suspect that communism originally was not a utopia.

2:51:04.480 --> 2:51:10.160
 I think that in the same way as original Christianity, it had a particular kind of vision.

2:51:10.160 --> 2:51:18.720
 And this vision is a society, a mode of organization within the society in which humans can coexist

2:51:18.720 --> 2:51:23.760
 at scale without coercion, in the same way as we do in a healthy family.

2:51:23.760 --> 2:51:29.400
 In a good family, you don't terrorize each other into compliance, but you understand

2:51:29.400 --> 2:51:33.720
 what everybody needs and what everybody is able to contribute and what the intended future

2:51:33.720 --> 2:51:35.440
 of the whole thing is.

2:51:35.440 --> 2:51:40.120
 And everybody coordinates their behavior in the right way and informs each other about

2:51:40.120 --> 2:51:46.040
 how to do this and all the interactions that happen are instrumental to making that happen.

2:51:46.040 --> 2:51:47.400
 Could this happen at scale?

2:51:47.400 --> 2:51:49.680
 And I think this is the idea of communism.

2:51:49.680 --> 2:51:54.600
 Communism is opposed to the idea that we need economic terror or other forms of terror to

2:51:54.600 --> 2:51:55.840
 make that happen.

2:51:55.840 --> 2:52:00.040
 But in practice, what happened is that the proto communist countries, the real existing

2:52:00.040 --> 2:52:04.920
 socialism, replaced a part of the economic terror with moral terror.

2:52:04.920 --> 2:52:07.680
 So we were told to do the right thing for moral reasons.

2:52:07.680 --> 2:52:09.360
 And of course, it didn't really work.

2:52:09.360 --> 2:52:11.840
 And the economy eventually collapsed.

2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:14.800
 And the moral terror had actual real cost.

2:52:14.800 --> 2:52:19.120
 People were imprisoned because they were morally noncompliant.

2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:24.880
 And the other thing is that the idea of communism became a utopia.

2:52:24.880 --> 2:52:27.200
 So it basically was projected into the afterlife.

2:52:27.200 --> 2:52:32.640
 We were told in my childhood that communism was a hypothetical society to which we were

2:52:32.640 --> 2:52:38.560
 in a permanent revolution that justified everything that was presently wrong with society morally.

2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:42.440
 But it was something that our grandchildren probably would not ever see because it was

2:52:42.440 --> 2:52:45.840
 too ideal and too far in the future to make it happen right now.

2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:48.680
 And people were just not there yet morally.

2:52:48.680 --> 2:52:51.320
 And the same thing happened with Christianity, right?

2:52:51.320 --> 2:52:55.400
 This notion of heaven was mythologized and projected into an afterlife.

2:52:55.400 --> 2:53:00.160
 And I think this was just the idea of God's kingdom, of this world in which we instantiate

2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:03.080
 the next level transcendental agent in the perfect form.

2:53:03.080 --> 2:53:08.280
 So everything goes smoothly and without violence and without conflict and without this human

2:53:08.280 --> 2:53:13.480
 messiness on this economic messiness and the terror and coercion that existed in the present

2:53:13.480 --> 2:53:15.000
 societies.

2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:20.000
 And the idea of that the humans can exist at scale in a harmonious way and noncoercively

2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:21.000
 is untested.

2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:22.000
 Right?

2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:25.400
 And both people tested it but didn't get it to work so far.

2:53:25.400 --> 2:53:29.200
 And the utopia is a world in where you get all the good things without any of the bad

2:53:29.200 --> 2:53:30.920
 things.

2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:35.080
 And you are, I think, very susceptible to believe in utopias when you are very young

2:53:35.080 --> 2:53:40.120
 and don't understand that everything has to happen in causal patterns, that there is always

2:53:40.120 --> 2:53:42.560
 feedback loops that ultimately are closed.

2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:45.360
 There's nothing that just happens because it's good or bad.

2:53:45.360 --> 2:53:47.200
 Good or bad don't exist in isolation.

2:53:47.200 --> 2:53:50.720
 They only exist with respect to larger systems.

2:53:50.720 --> 2:53:57.840
 So can you intuit why utopias fail as systems?

2:53:57.840 --> 2:54:05.600
 So having a utopia that's out there beyond the horizon, is it because then it's not only

2:54:05.600 --> 2:54:12.160
 because it's impossible to achieve utopias, but it's because what certain humans, certain

2:54:12.160 --> 2:54:25.480
 small number of humans start to sort of greedily attain power and money and control and influence

2:54:25.480 --> 2:54:34.880
 as they become, as they see the power in using this idea of a utopia for propaganda.

2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:37.320
 That's a little like saying, why is my garden not perfect?

2:54:37.320 --> 2:54:40.960
 It's because some evil weeds are overgrowing it and they always do.

2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:41.960
 Yeah.

2:54:41.960 --> 2:54:43.320
 So this is not how it works.

2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:49.960
 A good garden is a system that is in balance and requires minimal interactions by the gardener.

2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:55.320
 So you need to create a system that is designed to self stabilize and the design of social

2:54:55.320 --> 2:54:59.320
 systems requires not just the implementation of the desired functionality, but the next

2:54:59.320 --> 2:55:02.000
 level design, also in biological systems.

2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:06.400
 You need to create a system that wants to converge to the intended function.

2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:10.680
 So instead of just creating an institution like the FDA that is performing a particular

2:55:10.680 --> 2:55:16.320
 kind of role in society, you need to make sure that the FDA is actually driven by a system

2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:22.360
 that wants to do this optimally, that is incentivize to do it optimally, and then makes the performance

2:55:22.360 --> 2:55:28.280
 that is actually enacted in every generation instrumental to that thing, that actual goal.

2:55:28.280 --> 2:55:30.320
 That is much harder to design and to achieve.

2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:36.960
 See if the design a system where I'm English and communism also was quote unquote incentivized

2:55:36.960 --> 2:55:45.400
 to be a feedback loop system that achieves that utopia, it wasn't working given human

2:55:45.400 --> 2:55:46.400
 nature.

2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:48.040
 The incentives were not correct given human nature.

2:55:48.040 --> 2:55:49.040
 Yes.

2:55:49.040 --> 2:55:52.800
 So how do you incentivize people when they are getting coal off the ground to work as

2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:53.800
 hard as possible?

2:55:53.800 --> 2:55:54.800
 Yeah.

2:55:54.800 --> 2:55:59.680
 Because it's a terrible job and it's very bad for your health and how do you do this?

2:55:59.680 --> 2:56:05.320
 And you can give them prices and metals and status to some degree, there's only so much

2:56:05.320 --> 2:56:11.600
 status to give for that, and most people will not fall for this, or you can pay them.

2:56:11.600 --> 2:56:15.760
 And you probably have to pay them in an asymmetric way because if you pay everybody the same

2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:21.200
 and you nationalize the coal mines, eventually people will figure out that they can game

2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:22.200
 the system.

2:56:22.200 --> 2:56:23.200
 Yes.

2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:25.240
 So you're describing capitalism.

2:56:25.240 --> 2:56:28.880
 Capitalism is the present solution to the system.

2:56:28.880 --> 2:56:33.680
 And what we also noticed that I think that Marx was correct in saying that capitalism

2:56:33.680 --> 2:56:39.560
 is prone to crisis, that capitalism is a system that in its dynamics is not convergent

2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:40.560
 but divergent.

2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:43.200
 It's not a stable system.

2:56:43.200 --> 2:56:50.040
 And that eventually it produces an enormous potential for productivity, but it also is

2:56:50.040 --> 2:56:52.300
 systematically misallocating resources.

2:56:52.300 --> 2:56:56.920
 So a lot of people cannot participate in the production and consumption anymore.

2:56:56.920 --> 2:56:58.480
 And this is what we observe.

2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:02.520
 We observe that the middle class in the US is tiny.

2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:06.960
 That's a lot of people think that they're middle class, but if you are still flying

2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:11.960
 economy, you're not middle class, right?

2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:21.680
 Every class is a magnitude smaller than the previous class, and I think about classes

2:57:21.680 --> 2:57:29.200
 is really like airline classes, a lot of people are economy, business class and very few

2:57:29.200 --> 2:57:30.920
 are first class and summer budget.

2:57:30.920 --> 2:57:33.520
 I mean, I understand.

2:57:33.520 --> 2:57:39.120
 I think there is, yeah, maybe some people probably I would push back against that definition

2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:40.120
 of the middle class.

2:57:40.120 --> 2:57:43.720
 It does feel like the middle class is pretty large, but yes, there's a discrepancy in terms

2:57:43.720 --> 2:57:44.720
 of wealth.

2:57:44.720 --> 2:57:51.760
 So if you think about the terms of the productivity that our society could have, there is no reason

2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:54.040
 for anybody to fly economy, right?

2:57:54.040 --> 2:57:58.320
 We would be able to let everybody travel in style.

2:57:58.320 --> 2:58:01.800
 But also some people like to be frugal even when they're billionaires, okay?

2:58:01.800 --> 2:58:04.000
 So let's take that into account.

2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:08.840
 Yes, but I mean, we probably don't need to be traveling lavish, but you also don't need

2:58:08.840 --> 2:58:09.840
 to be tortured, right?

2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:14.120
 There is a difference between frugal and subjecting yourself to torture.

2:58:14.120 --> 2:58:15.120
 Listen, I love economy.

2:58:15.120 --> 2:58:20.160
 I don't understand why you're comparing a flying economy to torture.

2:58:20.160 --> 2:58:25.800
 Although the flight here, there's two crying babies next to me, so that, but that has nothing

2:58:25.800 --> 2:58:28.640
 to do with crying babies.

2:58:28.640 --> 2:58:29.640
 They're very cute though.

2:58:29.640 --> 2:58:37.760
 Yeah, I have two kids and sometimes I have to go back to visit the grandparents and back

2:58:37.760 --> 2:58:42.760
 means going from the west coast to Germany and that's a long flight.

2:58:42.760 --> 2:58:48.120
 Is it true that when you're a father, you grow immune to the crying and all that kind

2:58:48.120 --> 2:58:49.120
 of stuff?

2:58:49.120 --> 2:58:54.800
 Because like me just not having kids, other people's kids can be quite annoying when they're

2:58:54.800 --> 2:58:56.920
 crying and screaming and all that kind of stuff.

2:58:56.920 --> 2:59:02.000
 When you have children and you're wired up in the default natural way, you're lucky in

2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:04.680
 this regard, you fall in love with them.

2:59:04.680 --> 2:59:09.720
 And this falling in love with them means that you basically start to see the world through

2:59:09.720 --> 2:59:16.440
 their eyes and you understand that in a given situation, they cannot do anything but expressing

2:59:16.440 --> 2:59:17.920
 despair.

2:59:17.920 --> 2:59:19.720
 And so it becomes more differentiated.

2:59:19.720 --> 2:59:26.760
 I noticed that for instance, my son is typically acting on a pure experience of what things

2:59:26.760 --> 2:59:32.240
 are like right now and he has to do this right now and you have this small child that is

2:59:32.240 --> 2:59:37.680
 when he was a baby and so on where he was just immediately expressing what he felt and

2:59:37.680 --> 2:59:42.440
 if you cannot regulate this from the outside, there's no point to be upset about it.

2:59:42.440 --> 2:59:45.560
 It's like dealing with weather or something like this.

2:59:45.560 --> 2:59:48.880
 You all have to get through it and it's not easy for him either.

2:59:48.880 --> 2:59:53.600
 But if you also have a daughter, maybe she is planning for that.

2:59:53.600 --> 2:59:59.000
 Maybe she understands that she's sitting in the car behind you and she's screaming at

2:59:59.000 --> 3:00:02.720
 the top of her lungs and you're almost doing an accident and you really don't know what

3:00:02.720 --> 3:00:03.960
 to do.

3:00:03.960 --> 3:00:06.080
 What should I have done to make you stop screaming?

3:00:06.080 --> 3:00:10.080
 You could have given me candy.

3:00:10.080 --> 3:00:12.200
 I think that's like a cat versus dog discussion.

3:00:12.200 --> 3:00:13.200
 I love it.

3:00:13.200 --> 3:00:22.480
 Because you said like a fundamental aspect of that is love that makes it all worth it.

3:00:22.480 --> 3:00:29.680
 What in this monkey riding an elephant in a dream world, what role does love play in

3:00:29.680 --> 3:00:32.400
 the human condition?

3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:40.640
 I think that love is the facilitator of nontransactual interaction and you are observing your own

3:00:40.640 --> 3:00:41.640
 purposes.

3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:46.640
 They go beyond your ego, they go beyond the particular organism that you are and your

3:00:46.640 --> 3:00:47.640
 local interests.

3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:48.640
 That's what you mean by nontransactual.

3:00:48.640 --> 3:00:49.640
 Yes.

3:00:49.640 --> 3:00:53.640
 So basically when you are acting in a transactional way, it means that you are respecting something

3:00:53.640 --> 3:00:58.680
 in return for you from the one that you're interacting with.

3:00:58.680 --> 3:01:02.400
 You are interacting with a random stranger, you buy something from them on eBay, you expect

3:01:02.400 --> 3:01:06.080
 a fair value for the money that you sent them and vice versa.

3:01:06.080 --> 3:01:09.600
 Because you don't know that person, you don't have any kind of relationship to them.

3:01:09.600 --> 3:01:12.360
 And when you know this person a little bit better and you know the situation that they

3:01:12.360 --> 3:01:16.760
 are in and you understand what they try to achieve in their life and you approve because

3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:23.000
 you realize that they are in some sense serving the same human sacredness as you are.

3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:27.440
 And they need to think that you have, maybe you give it to them as a present.

3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:34.040
 But the feeling itself of joy is a kind of benefit, is a kind of transaction.

3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:37.000
 Yes, but the joy is not the point.

3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:41.000
 The joy is the signal that you get, it's the reinforcement signal that your brain sends

3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:46.240
 to you because you are acting on the incentives of the agent that you're part of.

3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:48.760
 We are meant to be part of something larger.

3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:54.680
 That is the way in which we outcompeted other hominins.

3:01:54.680 --> 3:01:55.680
 Take that Neanderthals.

3:01:55.680 --> 3:01:56.680
 Yeah, right.

3:01:56.680 --> 3:02:00.160
 And also other humans.

3:02:00.160 --> 3:02:06.720
 There was a population bottleneck for human society that leads to an extreme lack of genetic

3:02:06.720 --> 3:02:08.040
 diversity among humans.

3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:14.320
 If you look at Bushmen in the Kalahari that basically tribes that are not that far distant

3:02:14.320 --> 3:02:20.240
 to each other have more genetic diversity than exists between Europeans and Chinese.

3:02:20.240 --> 3:02:25.440
 And it's because basically the out of Africa population at some point had a bottleneck

3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:28.320
 of just a few thousand individuals.

3:02:28.320 --> 3:02:33.280
 And what probably happened is not that at any time the number of people shrunk below

3:02:33.280 --> 3:02:35.240
 a few hundred thousand.

3:02:35.240 --> 3:02:39.240
 What probably happened is that there was a small group that had a decisive mutation

3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:40.920
 that produced an advantage.

3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:44.200
 And this group multiplied and killed everybody else.

3:02:44.200 --> 3:02:46.240
 And we are descendants of that group.

3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:52.240
 Yeah, I wonder what the peculiar characteristics of that group.

3:02:52.240 --> 3:02:53.240
 Yeah.

3:02:53.240 --> 3:02:54.240
 I mean, we can never know.

3:02:54.240 --> 3:02:55.240
 Me too.

3:02:55.240 --> 3:02:56.240
 And a lot of people do.

3:02:56.240 --> 3:03:01.800
 We can only just listen to the echoes and the ripples that are still within us.

3:03:01.800 --> 3:03:08.520
 So I suspect what eventually made a big difference was the ability to organize at scale, to program

3:03:08.520 --> 3:03:10.280
 each other.

3:03:10.280 --> 3:03:11.280
 With ideas.

3:03:11.280 --> 3:03:16.600
 That we became programmable, that we are willing to work on lockstep, that we went below, above

3:03:16.600 --> 3:03:22.080
 the tribal level, that we no longer were groups of a few hundred individuals and acted on direct

3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:27.760
 reputation systems transactionally, but that we basically evolved an adaptation to become

3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:30.760
 state building.

3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:35.720
 To form collectives outside of the direct collectives.

3:03:35.720 --> 3:03:36.720
 Yes.

3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:41.760
 And that's basically a part of us became committed to serving something outside of what we know.

3:03:41.760 --> 3:03:42.760
 Yeah.

3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:44.280
 Then that's kind of what love is.

3:03:44.280 --> 3:03:48.000
 And it's terrifying because it meant that we eradicated the others.

3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:49.920
 It's a force.

3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:54.160
 It's an adaptive force that gets us ahead in evolution, which means we displaced something

3:03:54.160 --> 3:03:56.040
 else that doesn't have that.

3:03:56.040 --> 3:04:00.480
 Oh, so we had to murder a lot of people that weren't about love.

3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:01.480
 So love led to destruction.

3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:04.360
 They didn't have the same strong love as we did.

3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:07.520
 That's why I mentioned this thing, this fascism.

3:04:07.520 --> 3:04:12.320
 When you see these speeches, do you want total war?

3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:17.800
 And everybody says, yes, this is this big, oh my God, be a part of something that is

3:04:17.800 --> 3:04:23.160
 more important than me, that gives meaning to my existence.

3:04:23.160 --> 3:04:24.160
 Fair enough.

3:04:24.160 --> 3:04:33.720
 Do you have advice for young people today in high school, in college, that are thinking

3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:40.440
 about what to do with their career, with their life, so that at the end of the whole thing,

3:04:40.440 --> 3:04:44.000
 they could be proud of what they did?

3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:45.000
 Don't cheat.

3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:46.000
 Have integrity.

3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:47.000
 For integrity.

3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:52.720
 So what does integrity look like when you're at the river or at the leaf or the fat frog

3:04:52.720 --> 3:04:54.660
 in a lake?

3:04:54.660 --> 3:05:02.160
 It basically means that you try to figure out what the thing is that is the most right.

3:05:02.160 --> 3:05:07.280
 And this doesn't mean that you have to look for what other people tell you what's right,

3:05:07.280 --> 3:05:09.840
 but you have to aim for moral autonomy.

3:05:09.840 --> 3:05:13.640
 So things need to be right independently of what other people say.

3:05:13.640 --> 3:05:23.080
 I always felt that when people told me to listen to what others say, read the room,

3:05:23.080 --> 3:05:27.280
 build your ideas of what's true based on the high status people of your ingroup, that does

3:05:27.280 --> 3:05:29.800
 not protect me from fascism.

3:05:29.800 --> 3:05:34.760
 The only way to protect yourself from fascism is to decide it's the world that is being

3:05:34.760 --> 3:05:37.760
 built here, the world that I want to be in.

3:05:37.760 --> 3:05:43.600
 And so in some sense, try to make your behavior sustainable, act in such a way that you would

3:05:43.600 --> 3:05:46.800
 feel comfortable on all sides of the transaction.

3:05:46.800 --> 3:05:51.080
 Realize that everybody is you in a different timeline, but is seeing things differently

3:05:51.080 --> 3:05:53.120
 and has reasons to do so.

3:05:53.120 --> 3:05:58.320
 Yeah, I've come to realize this recently.

3:05:58.320 --> 3:06:03.240
 There is an inner voice that tells you what's right and wrong.

3:06:03.240 --> 3:06:10.000
 And speaking of reading the room, what integrity looks like is there's times when a lot of

3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:14.800
 people are doing something wrong and what integrity looks like is not going on Twitter

3:06:14.800 --> 3:06:21.680
 and tweeting about it, but not participating quietly, not doing, so it's not like signaling

3:06:21.680 --> 3:06:28.120
 or not all this kind of stuff, but actually living your what you think is right, like

3:06:28.120 --> 3:06:29.120
 living it.

3:06:29.120 --> 3:06:32.320
 That's also sometimes this expectation that others are like us.

3:06:32.320 --> 3:06:37.360
 So imagine the possibility that some of the people around you are space aliens that only

3:06:37.360 --> 3:06:39.560
 look human.

3:06:39.560 --> 3:06:41.800
 So they don't have the same prayers as you do.

3:06:41.800 --> 3:06:45.280
 They don't have the same impulses that's right and wrong.

3:06:45.280 --> 3:06:51.920
 There's a large diversity in these basic impulses that people can have in a given situation.

3:06:51.920 --> 3:06:54.720
 And now realize that you are a space alien.

3:06:54.720 --> 3:06:56.200
 You are not actually human.

3:06:56.200 --> 3:06:59.920
 You think that you're human, but you don't know what it means, like what it's like to

3:06:59.920 --> 3:07:00.920
 be human.

3:07:00.920 --> 3:07:04.240
 You just make it up as you go along like everybody else.

3:07:04.240 --> 3:07:10.040
 And you have to figure that out what it means that you are a full human being, what it means

3:07:10.040 --> 3:07:13.720
 to be human in the world and how to connect with others on that.

3:07:13.720 --> 3:07:19.920
 And there is also something, don't be afraid in the sense that if you do this, you're not

3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:25.320
 good enough because if you are acting on these incentives of integrity, you become trustworthy.

3:07:25.320 --> 3:07:27.960
 That's the way in which you can recognize each other.

3:07:27.960 --> 3:07:32.040
 There is a particular place where you can meet and you can figure out what that place

3:07:32.040 --> 3:07:38.360
 is, where you will give support to people because you realize that they act with integrity

3:07:38.360 --> 3:07:40.440
 and they will also do that.

3:07:40.440 --> 3:07:43.960
 So in some sense, you are safe if you do that.

3:07:43.960 --> 3:07:44.960
 You're not always protected.

3:07:44.960 --> 3:07:50.160
 There are people which will abuse you and that might, that are bad actors in a way that

3:07:50.160 --> 3:07:52.960
 it's hard to imagine before you meet them.

3:07:52.960 --> 3:07:57.400
 But there is also people which will try to protect you.

3:07:57.400 --> 3:08:04.360
 Yeah, that's such a, thank you for saying that, that's such a hopeful message that no

3:08:04.360 --> 3:08:08.440
 matter what happens to you, there will be a place.

3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:19.160
 There's people you'll meet that also have what you have and you will find happiness there

3:08:19.160 --> 3:08:20.160
 and safety there.

3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:21.800
 Yeah, but it doesn't need to end well.

3:08:21.800 --> 3:08:23.640
 It can also all go wrong.

3:08:23.640 --> 3:08:26.520
 So there's no guarantees in this life.

3:08:26.520 --> 3:08:32.400
 So you can do everything right and you still can fail and horrible things happen to you

3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:40.440
 that traumatize you and mutilate you and you have to be grateful if it doesn't happen.

3:08:40.440 --> 3:08:45.000
 And ultimately be grateful no matter what happens because even just being alive is pretty damn

3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:46.000
 nice.

3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:52.640
 Yeah, even that, you know, the gratefulness in some sense is also just generated by your

3:08:52.640 --> 3:08:57.200
 brain to keep you going.

3:08:57.200 --> 3:08:59.200
 It's all the trick.

3:08:59.200 --> 3:09:06.040
 Speaking of which, Camus said, I see many people die because they judge that life is

3:09:06.040 --> 3:09:08.000
 not worth living.

3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:12.760
 I see others paradoxically getting killed for their ideas or illusions that give them

3:09:12.760 --> 3:09:15.120
 a reason for living.

3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:19.400
 What is called the reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying.

3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:24.840
 I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions.

3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:31.640
 So I have to ask what Joshua Bach is the meaning of life?

3:09:31.640 --> 3:09:34.280
 It is an urgent question according to Camus.

3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:38.280
 I don't think that there's a single answer to this.

3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:41.480
 Nothing makes sense unless a mind makes it so.

3:09:41.480 --> 3:09:45.120
 So you basically have to project a purpose.

3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:49.880
 And if you zoom out far enough, there is the heat test of the universe and everything is

3:09:49.880 --> 3:09:50.880
 meaningless.

3:09:50.880 --> 3:09:52.240
 Everything is just a blip in between.

3:09:52.240 --> 3:09:55.920
 And the question is, do you find meaning in this blip in between?

3:09:55.920 --> 3:09:59.880
 Do you find meaning in observing squirrels?

3:09:59.880 --> 3:10:04.560
 Do you find meaning in raising children and projecting a multigenerational organism into

3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:05.560
 the future?

3:10:05.560 --> 3:10:10.720
 Do you find meaning in projecting an aesthetic of the world that you like to the future and

3:10:10.720 --> 3:10:12.480
 trying to serve that aesthetic?

3:10:12.480 --> 3:10:15.520
 And if you do, then life has that meaning.

3:10:15.520 --> 3:10:18.280
 And if you don't, then it doesn't.

3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:26.040
 I kind of enjoy the idea that you just create the most vibrant, the most weird, the most

3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:32.120
 unique kind of blip you can, given your environment, given your set of skills.

3:10:32.120 --> 3:10:41.800
 Just be the most weird set of like local pocket of complexity you can be.

3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:47.360
 So that when people study the universe, they'll pause and be like, uh, that's weird.

3:10:47.360 --> 3:10:52.640
 It looks like a useful strategy, but of course it's still motivated reasoning.

3:10:52.640 --> 3:10:57.800
 You're obviously acting on your incentives here.

3:10:57.800 --> 3:11:02.840
 It's still a story we tell ourselves when then a dream that's hardly in touch with

3:11:02.840 --> 3:11:03.840
 reality.

3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:10.360
 It's definitely a good strategy if you are a podcaster.

3:11:10.360 --> 3:11:14.360
 And the human, which I'm still trying to figure out if I am, there's a mutual relationship

3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:15.360
 somehow.

3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:16.360
 Somehow.

3:11:16.360 --> 3:11:20.840
 Josh, you're you're one of the most incredible people I know.

3:11:20.840 --> 3:11:22.360
 I really love talking to you.

3:11:22.360 --> 3:11:26.720
 I love talking to you again, and it's really an honor that you spend your valuable time

3:11:26.720 --> 3:11:27.720
 with me.

3:11:27.720 --> 3:11:32.440
 I hope we get to talk many times throughout our, uh, through our short and meaningless

3:11:32.440 --> 3:11:33.440
 lives.

3:11:33.440 --> 3:11:34.440
 I'm meaningful.

3:11:34.440 --> 3:11:35.440
 I'm meaningful.

3:11:35.440 --> 3:11:36.440
 Thank you, Alex.

3:11:36.440 --> 3:11:39.200
 I enjoyed this conversation very much.

3:11:39.200 --> 3:11:44.160
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yosha Bach and thank you to Coinbase,

3:11:44.160 --> 3:11:48.680
 Codecademy, Linode, Netsuite, and ExpressVPN.

3:11:48.680 --> 3:11:51.560
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

3:11:51.560 --> 3:11:56.040
 Now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.

3:11:56.040 --> 3:12:01.960
 People will do anything, no matter how absurd in order to avoid facing their own souls.

3:12:01.960 --> 3:12:07.160
 One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness

3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:09.400
 conscious.

3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:37.480
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
