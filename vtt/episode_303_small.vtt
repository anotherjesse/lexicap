00:00.000 --> 00:04.920
 The real foundation of Marx's political philosophy was the economic argument that there would

00:04.920 --> 00:08.440
 be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall.

00:08.440 --> 00:14.040
 And that tendency for the rate of profit to fall would lead to capitalists batting down

00:14.040 --> 00:21.280
 on workers harder, paying them less than their subsistence, a revolt by workers against this,

00:21.280 --> 00:24.000
 and then you would get socialism on the other side.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.520
 So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall played a critical role in

00:29.520 --> 00:32.720
 his explanation of why socialism would have to come about.

00:32.720 --> 00:37.720
 If you look at Marx's own vision of the revolution, it was going to happen in England.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.200
 The advanced economies would be first to go through the revolution.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.720
 The socialist, the primitive economies would have to go through a capitalist transition.

00:45.720 --> 00:49.040
 And this is the difference when the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.

00:49.040 --> 00:52.600
 So the Mensheviks and Hyman Minsky came out of the Menshevik family.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.480
 The Mensheviks believed you had to go through a capitalist phase.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.920
 Russia had to go through a capitalist period before it become socialist.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.680
 The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go.

01:03.680 --> 01:08.040
 The following is a conversation with Steve Keane, a brilliant economist that criticizes

01:08.040 --> 01:13.400
 much of modern economics and proposes new theories and models that integrate some ideas

01:13.400 --> 01:19.160
 and ditch others from very thinkers, from Karl Marx to John Maynard Keynes to Hyman

01:19.160 --> 01:20.160
 Minsky.

01:20.160 --> 01:25.920
 In fact, a lot of our conversations about Karl Marx and Marxian economics.

01:25.920 --> 01:30.360
 He has been a scholar of Karl Marx's work for many years.

01:30.360 --> 01:33.400
 So this was a fascinating exploration.

01:33.400 --> 01:39.000
 He has written several books I recommend, including the New Economics in Manifesto and

01:39.000 --> 01:41.800
 Debunking Economics.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.640
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.320
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:47.320 --> 01:51.600
 And now, dear friends, here's Steve Keane.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.560
 Let's start with a big question.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.080
 What is economics?

01:55.080 --> 01:59.600
 Or maybe what is or should be the goal of economics?

01:59.600 --> 02:00.600
 Well, it should be.

02:00.600 --> 02:05.680
 I understand how human civilization comes about and how it can be maintained.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.160
 And that's not what it's been at all.

02:08.160 --> 02:12.360
 So we have a discipline which has the right name and the wrong soul.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.680
 What is the soul of economics?

02:13.680 --> 02:20.240
 The soul of economics really is to explain how do we manage to build a civilization

02:20.240 --> 02:29.760
 that elevates us so far above the energy and consumption and knowledge levels of the base

02:29.760 --> 02:30.760
 environment of the earth.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.880
 Because if you think about, and this is actually working from, a work I've learned from Tim

02:34.880 --> 02:38.920
 Garrett, who's one of my research colleagues, who's an atmospheric physicist.

02:38.920 --> 02:44.760
 And his idea is that we have these, we exploit these high grade energy sources from the sun

02:44.760 --> 02:47.880
 itself to coal, nuclear, et cetera, et cetera.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.960
 Which means we can maintain a level of human civilization well above what we'd have if

02:51.960 --> 02:55.400
 we were just still running around with rocks and stones and spears.

02:55.400 --> 03:02.040
 So it's that elevation above the base level of the planet, which is human civilization.

03:02.040 --> 03:06.480
 And if we didn't have this energy we were exploiting, if we didn't use the environment

03:06.480 --> 03:10.840
 to elevate ourselves above what's possible in the background, then you and I wouldn't

03:10.840 --> 03:13.360
 be talking into microphones.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.200
 We might be doing drumbeats and stuff like this, but we wouldn't be having the sort of

03:17.200 --> 03:18.680
 conversation we have.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.760
 So we'd explain how that came about, that what's the economic should be doing and it's

03:22.760 --> 03:23.760
 not.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.320
 So this is the greatest thing that the earth has ever created, is what you're saying,

03:26.320 --> 03:27.320
 this conversation?

03:27.320 --> 03:31.000
 Yeah, we're the most elaborate construction on the planet.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.640
 And that's not what we've done, we've denigrated the planet itself.

03:34.640 --> 03:38.560
 We don't have respect for the fact that life itself is an incredible creation.

03:38.560 --> 03:43.600
 And my ultimate, if I had to see how humanity is going to survive what we're putting ourselves

03:43.600 --> 03:49.360
 through, then we'd have to come out of it as a species which sees its role as preserving

03:49.360 --> 03:51.360
 and respecting life.

03:51.360 --> 04:00.840
 I like how you took my silly, incredible statement and made it into a serious one about how amazing

04:00.840 --> 04:01.840
 life is.

04:01.840 --> 04:07.440
 Life is incredible and when humans don't respect it enough, we trash it.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.480
 And that's what economics, I think, has played a huge role in that.

04:10.480 --> 04:15.400
 So I actually regard my discipline, I would never call it a profession, let alone a science.

04:15.400 --> 04:22.760
 My discipline has probably helped bring about the termination potential, the feasible termination

04:22.760 --> 04:24.160
 of human civilization.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.160
 Strong words.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.040
 Okay, let's return to the basics of economics.

04:28.040 --> 04:33.160
 So what is the soul and the practice of economics?

04:33.160 --> 04:34.600
 What should be the goal of it?

04:34.600 --> 04:41.240
 Because you're speaking very poetically, but we'll also speak pragmatically about the

04:41.240 --> 04:47.280
 tools of economics, the variables of economics, the metrics, the goals, the models.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.280
 Practically speaking, what are the goals of economics?

04:50.280 --> 04:55.920
 Well, in terms of the tools we use, we should be using the tools that engineers use, frankly.

04:55.920 --> 05:01.000
 And that sounds ridiculously simple because you would expect that economists are using

05:01.000 --> 05:06.800
 up to date techniques that are common in other sciences where you're dealing with similar

05:06.800 --> 05:12.080
 ideas of stocks and flows and interactions between the environment and a system and so

05:12.080 --> 05:13.080
 on.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.080
 And that's fundamentally systems engineering.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.080
 And that's what we should be using as the tools of economics.

05:18.080 --> 05:22.440
 Now if you look at what economists actually do, the sophisticated stuff involves difference

05:22.440 --> 05:25.160
 equations.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.160
 And like difference equations, you know, if you've done enough mathematics as you have,

05:29.160 --> 05:33.480
 you know, difference equations are useful for like individual level processes.

05:33.480 --> 05:38.440
 If you're talking about a time or so on, it'll go from state t to t plus one, t plus two

05:38.440 --> 05:39.520
 and so on.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.400
 But not when you're talking at the aggregate level.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.600
 There you use differential equations to measure it all.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.600
 Economists have been using different equations.

05:46.600 --> 05:52.160
 So there's like a book, I think it's by Sargent and one other called Advanced Methods in Economics

05:52.160 --> 05:54.280
 Using Python, two volume set.

05:54.280 --> 06:00.760
 It's about close to 2,000 pages and four of those pages run differential equations.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.040
 The rest is all difference equations.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.920
 So they're using entirely the wrong mathematics to start with.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.960
 For people listening, what is difference equations versus differential equations?

06:09.960 --> 06:12.640
 Difference equation is like you can do in a spreadsheet.

06:12.640 --> 06:16.000
 You'll have, this is a value for nine and ninety, this is a value for nine and ninety

06:16.000 --> 06:18.320
 one, ninety two and ninety three and ninety four.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.840
 So you have discrete jumps in time.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.440
 Just a differential equation says there's a process moving through time and you will

06:26.440 --> 06:32.600
 have a rate of change of the variable is a function of the state of itself and other

06:32.600 --> 06:35.760
 variables and rates of change of those variables.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.440
 And that is what you use when you're doing an aggregate model.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.880
 So if you're modeling water, for example, or fluid dynamics, you have a set of differential

06:42.880 --> 06:47.520
 equations describing the entire body of fluid moving through time.

06:47.520 --> 06:52.440
 You don't try to model the discrete motion motion of each molecule of H2O.

06:52.440 --> 06:56.320
 So at the aggregate level, you use differential equations for processes that occur through

06:56.320 --> 06:59.960
 time and that's economics that occurs through time.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.400
 You should be using that particular technology.

07:02.400 --> 07:07.840
 But some economists do learn differential equations, but they don't learn stability analysis.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.240
 So they simply assume equilibrium is stable and they work in equilibrium terms all the

07:12.240 --> 07:13.240
 time.

07:13.240 --> 07:21.320
 And that it is the technical level, it's an incredibly complicated way of modeling the

07:21.320 --> 07:23.840
 world using entirely the wrong tools.

07:23.840 --> 07:24.840
 Okay.

07:24.840 --> 07:29.640
 We'll talk about that because it's unclear what the right tools are.

07:29.640 --> 07:33.480
 Maybe it's more clear to you, but I've got to make it clear to an audience.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.480
 Well, so this is a very complicated world.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.880
 It's a complex world.

07:37.880 --> 07:47.880
 We'll talk about some of the most complex systems on earth are the human mind, the economy,

07:47.880 --> 07:49.560
 and the biosphere.

07:49.560 --> 07:53.920
 So we'll go to that place.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.400
 I'm fascinated by complex systems.

07:56.400 --> 08:03.080
 I'm humbled by them even at their simplest level of cellular automata.

08:03.080 --> 08:10.760
 I'm not sure what the right tools are to understand that, especially when part of the complex

08:10.760 --> 08:13.880
 system is like a hierarchy of other complex systems.

08:13.880 --> 08:20.080
 You said the economy is a fascinating complex system, but it's made up of human minds.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.920
 And those are interesting.

08:21.920 --> 08:26.680
 Those are interesting, perhaps impossible to model, but we can try and we can try to

08:26.680 --> 08:30.280
 figure out how to approximate them and maybe that's the challenge of economics.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
 Okay.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.120
 Let's keep returning to the basics.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.360
 Let us try to learn something from history.

08:36.360 --> 08:42.560
 I also see as part of economics is us trying to figure out stuff and there's a few smart

08:42.560 --> 08:49.240
 folks that write books throughout human history and sometimes they name schools of economics

08:49.240 --> 08:50.640
 after them.

08:50.640 --> 08:56.160
 So let us take a stroll through history.

08:56.160 --> 09:02.480
 Can you describe at a high level what are the different schools of economics, perhaps

09:02.480 --> 09:09.000
 ones that are interesting to you, perhaps ones that the difference between which reveal

09:09.000 --> 09:14.040
 something useful or insightful for our conversation.

09:14.040 --> 09:22.680
 So you could, you know, classical, post Kenzian, Austrian, I like the biophysical economics

09:22.680 --> 09:26.640
 and so on, other heterodox economic schools that you find interesting.

09:26.640 --> 09:27.640
 Okay.

09:27.640 --> 09:32.080
 I actually find interesting a school which went extinct about 250 years ago.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.440
 That's where I'd like to start from.

09:33.440 --> 09:38.480
 And they're called the Physicocrats and the name itself implies where their knowledge

09:38.480 --> 09:44.480
 came from because if you go back far enough in history, we didn't do autopsies, but when

09:44.480 --> 09:49.480
 you started doing autopsies, they found wires, they found tubes, et cetera, et cetera.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.640
 And they started seeing the body as a circulation system and they played the same sort of logic

09:53.640 --> 09:55.280
 to the economy.

09:55.280 --> 10:00.880
 And they became out of an agricultural economy, which is France, and they saw that the wealth

10:00.880 --> 10:03.120
 came effectively from the sun.

10:03.120 --> 10:07.200
 So this oil wealth comes from, they said the soil, but what they really mean is the soil

10:07.200 --> 10:09.160
 absorbs the energy of the sun.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.080
 One seed plants, a thousand flea seeds come back.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.880
 There is no surplus.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.560
 We are simply mining what we can find out of the natural economy.

10:17.560 --> 10:20.800
 That's where we should have stayed and developed from that forward.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.920
 We then went through the classical school of economics, which comes out of Adam Smith.

10:24.920 --> 10:31.720
 And Smith, coming from Scotland, looked at what the Physicocrats said and what the Physicocrats

10:31.720 --> 10:34.760
 argued was that agriculture is the source of all wealth.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.200
 And the manufacturing sector is sterile.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.760
 That's literally the term they use to describe the manufacturing sector.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.000
 What does sterile mean?

10:41.000 --> 10:46.160
 Sterile means you don't extract value, you simply change the shape of value.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.280
 So the value comes from the soil.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.000
 The value comes from the soil.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.520
 That's the free gift of nature.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.400
 That's literally the phrase they used.

10:54.400 --> 10:59.280
 And we then distribute the free gift of nature around and we need carriages, which was the

10:59.280 --> 11:04.360
 manufacturing term they used at the time, as well as wheat.

11:04.360 --> 11:09.480
 So to make the carriages, we take what's been taken from the soil and we convert it to a

11:09.480 --> 11:10.480
 different form.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.040
 But there is no value added in manufacturing.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.600
 So Smith looked at that and said, well, I'm from Scotland.

11:16.600 --> 11:21.640
 And we've got these industries, you know, and we make stuff and it's a machinery.

11:21.640 --> 11:26.360
 And he said, no, it's not land that gives us the source of value, it's labor.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.080
 Now that led to the classical school of thought.

11:29.080 --> 11:36.000
 And that said that all value comes from labor, that value is objective.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.080
 So it's the amount of effort you put in that the price to things will exchange for reflects

11:40.080 --> 11:42.920
 the relative effort that's involved in the manufacturing.

11:42.920 --> 11:47.160
 So this computer takes two hours to make and this bottle takes two minutes to make, then

11:47.160 --> 11:50.520
 there's this is worth 60 times as much as that.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.600
 They didn't talk about marginal cost.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.560
 It was absolute cost, effectively.

11:55.560 --> 12:01.920
 They didn't talk about utility as a subjective thing, they ridiculed subjective utility theory.

12:01.920 --> 12:07.400
 That led to Marx and Marx is probably the most brilliant mind in the history of economics.

12:07.400 --> 12:12.160
 The only other competitor I'd see is Schumpeter, possibly Keynes, but in my terms of ranking

12:12.160 --> 12:17.800
 of intellects of you, Marx, Schumpeter, Keynes in terms of the outstanding capacities to

12:17.800 --> 12:18.800
 think.

12:18.800 --> 12:24.840
 But Marx then turned that classical school, which was pro capitalism and anti feudal into

12:24.840 --> 12:29.720
 a critique of capitalism, which led to the neoclassical school coming along as a defense

12:29.720 --> 12:35.880
 of capitalism, but they defended it using the ideas of the subjective theory of value

12:35.880 --> 12:37.840
 so that value does not reflect effort.

12:37.840 --> 12:44.360
 It's the satisfaction individuals get from different objects that determines their value,

12:44.360 --> 12:45.760
 marginal utility.

12:45.760 --> 12:50.000
 It's the marginal cost that determines how much they sell for.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.160
 Capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility.

12:54.160 --> 12:59.520
 And the concepts of equilibrium and marginal this and marginal that became the neoclassical

12:59.520 --> 13:00.520
 school.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.680
 And that's still the dominant school now 150 years later.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.560
 So that's the one that everybody learns.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.560
 And when you first learn economics, if you don't have the critical background that I

13:08.560 --> 13:12.000
 managed to acquire, that's what you think is economics.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.120
 The marginal utility equilibrium oriented analysis of mainstream economics.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.520
 And for example, they ignore money.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.720
 People think economists, you must be an expert on money because you're an economist.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.920
 Well, in fact, economists learn literally in the first few weeks at university that money

13:27.920 --> 13:28.920
 is irrelevant.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.920
 They say money illusion.

13:31.920 --> 13:36.920
 They represent people's tastes using what they call indifference curves.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.200
 And they're like isoquants on a weather map.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.000
 If you look at an isoquant, it shows you all the points of the same pressure.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.480
 So you can be here or you can be in Denver and the air pressure can be the same if you're

13:47.480 --> 13:48.640
 in the same weather unit.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.640
 So you just draw a cell that links together.

13:50.640 --> 13:55.040
 Well, they do the same thing with utility and say lots of bananas and very few coconuts

13:55.040 --> 13:59.320
 can give you the same utility as lots of coconuts and very few bananas.

13:59.320 --> 14:04.600
 And you draw basically like a hyperbola running down and linking the two.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.640
 And they'll say, well, that's your utility.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.400
 That describes your tastes.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.560
 And then we have your income.

14:09.560 --> 14:15.520
 And given your income, you can buy that many bananas completely or that many coconuts or

14:15.520 --> 14:17.720
 a straight line combination of the two.

14:17.720 --> 14:22.440
 And then if we double the price, nominal price of coconuts and double the nominal price of

14:22.440 --> 14:25.480
 bananas and double your income, what happens?

14:25.480 --> 14:27.840
 And the correct answer is, oh, nothing, sir.

14:27.840 --> 14:34.120
 You state the same point of tangency between what your budget is and which particular utility

14:34.120 --> 14:36.960
 curve gives you the maximum satisfaction.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.240
 So that gets ingrained into them.

14:38.240 --> 14:42.440
 And they think anybody who worries about money suffers from money illusion.

14:42.440 --> 14:48.120
 You are therefore ignorant of the deep insights of economics if you think money actually matters.

14:48.120 --> 14:52.840
 So you have an entire theory of economics, which presumes we exchange through barter.

14:52.840 --> 14:59.160
 I'll swap you that Microsoft surface for, I'll take two of those for one of these.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.040
 We do this bartering type arrangement.

15:02.040 --> 15:07.800
 In fact, that only works if money plays no creative role in the economy.

15:07.800 --> 15:12.600
 And that's where you find reading Schumpeter, the insight that's the school of thought that

15:12.600 --> 15:15.240
 I come from that says money is essential.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.760
 Money actually adds to demand.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.120
 And we'll talk about that later on.

15:19.120 --> 15:26.240
 So that's the neoclassical school that ends up being subjective theory of value, non

15:26.240 --> 15:33.560
 monetary as though everything happens in barter and focusing on equilibrium as though everything

15:33.560 --> 15:35.280
 happens in equilibrium.

15:35.280 --> 15:39.280
 Or if you get disturbed from equilibrium, you return back to it again.

15:39.280 --> 15:46.040
 And that mindset describes capitalism is most interesting feature is that it reaches equilibrium.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.640
 Now what planet are we on to believe that?

15:48.640 --> 15:54.080
 Because if you look at the real world, the real exciting world of capitalism in which

15:54.080 --> 15:59.400
 we live, change is by far the most obvious characteristic of it.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
 There's no equilibrium.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.080
 There's no equilibrium, but it's unstable.

16:03.080 --> 16:07.800
 And as a mathematician, it's easy to work with stability analysis.

16:07.800 --> 16:14.240
 You work out what the Jacobian is, you work out your Lyapunov exponents in a complex system.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.120
 You're used to the idea that equilibrium is unstable.

16:17.120 --> 16:21.400
 But economists get schooled and believing that everything happens in equilibrium and

16:21.400 --> 16:23.320
 they don't learn stability analysis.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.200
 So all that stuff is missing.

16:25.200 --> 16:32.320
 So onto the schools of thought, treating the economy as an equilibrium system, which was

16:32.320 --> 16:36.760
 what the neoclassical school did, is what Keynes disturbed.

16:36.760 --> 16:41.720
 And he really disturbed it by talking about fundamentally that uncertainty determines our

16:41.720 --> 16:43.560
 decisions about the future.

16:43.560 --> 16:48.840
 So when we consume, you know, if you like Pfizer or whatever particular drink we want

16:48.840 --> 16:51.920
 to have, you know the current situation.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.080
 But to invest, you must be making guesses about the future.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.640
 But you don't know the future.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.720
 So what do you do?

16:57.720 --> 17:00.400
 You extrapolate what you currently know.

17:00.400 --> 17:05.360
 And this is a terrible basis on which to plan for the future.

17:05.360 --> 17:10.720
 But this is the only thing you can do where there is no possibility of solid calculation.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.000
 So investment is therefore subject to uncertainty.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.560
 And therefore, you will get volatility out of investment.

17:17.560 --> 17:22.760
 You will get fads, of course, booms and slumps coming out of that because people extrapolate

17:22.760 --> 17:24.600
 forward the current conditions.

17:24.600 --> 17:27.320
 And that's the normal state of a capitalist economy.

17:27.320 --> 17:30.920
 And Schumpeter argued that that's what gives us this creativity as well.

17:30.920 --> 17:36.320
 The fact that you can perceive a potential demand, but you don't, first of all, you don't

17:36.320 --> 17:38.080
 know whether that demand is going to work.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.200
 Secondly, you don't know who your competitor is going to be, whether somebody's going to

17:41.200 --> 17:42.760
 be ahead of you or behind.

17:42.760 --> 17:46.720
 If there's a fad, you'll overinvest, OK?

17:46.720 --> 17:48.840
 All this stuff is the real nature of capitalism.

17:48.840 --> 17:54.960
 And that's what we're trying to capture, the dynamic, nonequilibrium, monetary violence

17:54.960 --> 17:57.080
 and creativity of capitalism.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.800
 That's what we should be analyzing.

17:58.800 --> 18:03.760
 And the post Keynesian school has gone in that orientation.

18:03.760 --> 18:09.280
 They've been, in my opinion, inhibited by learning their mathematics from neoclassical

18:09.280 --> 18:12.800
 economists so they don't have enough of the technology of complex systems.

18:12.800 --> 18:17.660
 There's only a really tiny handful of people working in complex systems analysis in post

18:17.660 --> 18:18.660
 Keynesian economics.

18:18.660 --> 18:21.040
 But that is, to me, the most interesting area.

18:21.040 --> 18:26.000
 So their tools may be lacking, but they fundamentally accept the instability of things.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
 That's right.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
 That's right.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
 And so that's what makes them interesting.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.640
 So let me try to summarize what you said, and then you say how stupid I am.

18:32.640 --> 18:40.920
 OK, so then there was the physiocrats that thought value came from the land.

18:40.920 --> 18:49.920
 Then there's Adam Smith, who said, nah, value comes from human labor.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.640
 That was the classical school.

18:52.640 --> 18:59.760
 And then neoclassical is value comes from bananas and coconuts.

18:59.760 --> 19:06.280
 Human preference is like human happiness, how happy a banana makes you.

19:06.280 --> 19:13.480
 And then the Keynesian and the post Keynesian were like, yeah, well, you can't, you can

19:13.480 --> 19:19.040
 never, the moment you try to put value to a banana and a coconut, you're already working

19:19.040 --> 19:21.800
 in the past.

19:21.800 --> 19:28.160
 It's always going to be chaos and stability, and then you're fishing in uncertain waters.

19:28.160 --> 19:32.760
 And that's why we have to embrace that and come up with tools that model that well.

19:32.760 --> 19:36.840
 And also, Joseph Schumpeter, what school would you put him under?

19:36.840 --> 19:40.960
 Is he a Keynesian or is he Austrian economics?

19:40.960 --> 19:41.960
 He's an Austrian.

19:41.960 --> 19:42.960
 The Austrians deny.

19:42.960 --> 19:43.960
 OK.

19:43.960 --> 19:44.960
 That's the intriguing.

19:44.960 --> 19:51.040
 He's from Austria, but he's not an Austrian economist.

19:51.040 --> 19:54.200
 There are elements that the Austrians go to thought, which are worthwhile.

19:54.200 --> 19:59.160
 What is Austrian economics in this beautiful whirlwind picture that you painted?

19:59.160 --> 20:00.160
 OK.

20:00.160 --> 20:04.240
 Austrian economics grew out of the rebellion against the classical school.

20:04.240 --> 20:09.400
 So you had three intellects who mainly led the growth of the neoclassical school back

20:09.400 --> 20:16.240
 in the 1870s, as William Jevons from England, Menga, who's from Austria, and Volras from

20:16.240 --> 20:17.560
 France.

20:17.560 --> 20:26.400
 And Volras tried to work out a set of equations to describe a multiproduct economy where there's

20:26.400 --> 20:29.800
 numerous producers and numerous consumers.

20:29.800 --> 20:34.000
 Everybody's both a producer and a consumer, and you try to work out a vector of prices

20:34.000 --> 20:37.680
 that will give you equilibrium in all markets instantaneously.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.640
 And that's his equilibrium orientation.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.000
 Jevons is also one about equilibrium, but he worked more at the aggregate level.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.080
 So this is a supply curve and a demand curve, and that's what Marshall ultimately codified.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.560
 Menga was pretty much saying that, well, yes, there might be an equilibrium, but you're

20:52.560 --> 20:54.440
 going to get disturbed from it all the time.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.000
 You'll be above or below the equilibrium.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.480
 And what came out of the Austrian school was an acceptance of that sort of vision that

21:00.480 --> 21:04.320
 a market should reach equilibrium, but then said, well, you'll get disturbed away from

21:04.320 --> 21:05.680
 the equilibrium.

21:05.680 --> 21:10.920
 And that's what gives you the vitality of capitalism, because an entrepreneur will see

21:10.920 --> 21:15.440
 an arbitrage advantage and try to close that gap, and that will give you innovation over

21:15.440 --> 21:16.440
 time.

21:16.440 --> 21:21.200
 And Schumpeter went beyond that and saw the role of money and said that an entrepreneur

21:21.200 --> 21:25.080
 is somebody with a great idea and no money.

21:25.080 --> 21:30.040
 So to become a capitalist, you've got to get money, and therefore you've got to approach

21:30.040 --> 21:35.360
 the finance sector to get the money, and the finance sector creates money and also creates

21:35.360 --> 21:37.440
 the debt for the entrepreneur.

21:37.440 --> 21:42.840
 And so you get this financial engine turning up as well, and you will get movements away

21:42.840 --> 21:44.800
 from equilibrium out of that.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.440
 You won't necessarily head back towards the equilibrium.

21:47.440 --> 21:54.160
 So Schumpeter has a rich vision of capitalism in which money plays an essential role, in

21:54.160 --> 21:59.200
 which you will be disturbed from equilibrium all the time.

21:59.200 --> 22:04.240
 And that is really, I think, a much closer vision of actual capitalism than anything

22:04.240 --> 22:12.760
 by even the leading Austrians, you know, Hayek, et cetera, et cetera, and certainly

22:12.760 --> 22:19.280
 Rhombardo, I find totally like reading a cardboard cut out version of the wealth of

22:19.280 --> 22:20.280
 nations.

22:20.280 --> 22:23.680
 I find his worth trivial.

22:23.680 --> 22:28.040
 But Schumpeter was rich, but with the same foundations as the Austrians.

22:28.040 --> 22:31.520
 But because he talked about the importance of money, that took him away from the Austrian

22:31.520 --> 22:36.440
 vision, which is very much based on a hard money, idea of capitalism, Schumpeter said

22:36.440 --> 22:42.680
 you needed the capacity of the financial sector to create money to empower entrepreneurs.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.840
 And that's a very important vision.

22:44.840 --> 22:48.640
 So Schumpeter's argument is the deviation from equilibrium, that's where all the fun

22:48.640 --> 22:49.640
 happens.

22:49.640 --> 22:50.640
 That's where all the magic happens.

22:50.640 --> 22:51.640
 That's the magic of capitalism.

22:51.640 --> 22:55.320
 And like the Austrians, because they focus on the deviation from equilibrium are better

22:55.320 --> 22:59.400
 than their classicals, but they still have this belief in the, you know, you'll reach

22:59.400 --> 23:03.200
 equilibrium ultimately or you'll head back towards it.

23:03.200 --> 23:08.640
 Whereas they don't have an explanation of capitalism that gives you cycles apart from

23:08.640 --> 23:11.120
 having the wrong rate of interest.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.840
 So there's no role for an accumulation of debt over time.

23:13.840 --> 23:20.040
 So what Schumpeter gave us was a vision of the creativity of capitalism being driven

23:20.040 --> 23:25.160
 by entrepreneurs who are funded by money creation by the finance sector.

23:25.160 --> 23:29.000
 And that's fundamentally the world in which we live.

23:29.000 --> 23:36.680
 So there's also kids these days are all into modern monetary theory, what's that about?

23:36.680 --> 23:37.680
 Okay.

23:37.680 --> 23:42.240
 Modern monetary theory is accounting when I summarize it bluntly.

23:42.240 --> 23:46.600
 It's simply saying, let's do the accounting because what money is, is a creature of double

23:46.600 --> 23:47.600
 entry bookkeeping.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.600
 Okay.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.600
 What's double entry bookkeeping?

23:49.600 --> 23:50.600
 Banks.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.120
 This was invented back in the 1500s in Italy.

23:53.120 --> 23:57.960
 I've forgotten the particular merchant who did it based on some Arabic ideas as well.

23:57.960 --> 24:04.760
 But the thing is, if you want to keep track of your financial flows, then you divide what

24:04.760 --> 24:10.400
 you, all the financial claims on you, you divide into claims you have on somebody else,

24:10.400 --> 24:14.680
 which are your assets, claims somebody else has on you, which are your liabilities, and

24:14.680 --> 24:17.200
 the gap between the two is your equity.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.280
 So you record every transaction twice on one row.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.280
 Okay.

24:21.280 --> 24:26.440
 So for example, if you and I do a financial transfer, you have a bank account, I have

24:26.440 --> 24:30.360
 a bank account, your bank account will go down, mine goes up.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.360
 Okay.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.040
 And that's the sum of the operation is zero.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.040
 Okay.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.400
 But on the other hand, if I go to a bank and borrow money, then my account goes up, they

24:38.400 --> 24:41.680
 put money in my deposit account, the bank's assets go up.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.680
 Okay.

24:42.680 --> 24:47.000
 And there's still the same sum applies, assets minus liabilities, minus equity equals zero.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.960
 Now that's simply saying money is an accounting, a creature of accounting.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.000
 It's not a creature of a commodity.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.200
 So if you think about how Austrians think about money and how Goldbugs think about money

24:58.200 --> 25:02.520
 and Bitcoin enthusiasts, if there are any left, think about money.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.640
 What they see is money is an object.

25:04.640 --> 25:05.640
 Okay.

25:05.640 --> 25:08.680
 And you and I can both have more gold.

25:08.680 --> 25:13.440
 If we're both willing to go to this, you know, a mine somewhere and dig a few holes and get

25:13.440 --> 25:14.840
 a few specks of gold out.

25:14.840 --> 25:20.000
 So there's no competition or no interaction between you and me if money is gold.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.160
 And they think money should be an object, a commodity.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.800
 But money fundamentally is not a commodity.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.280
 It's a claim on somebody else.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.640
 That's money as its essence.

25:29.640 --> 25:32.680
 So when you do it, you must use double entry bookkeeping to do it.

25:32.680 --> 25:36.360
 And then when you do, you find all the answers that come out of thinking as money is a commodity,

25:36.360 --> 25:37.520
 you're wrong.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.320
 So for example, and I've got Elon on this one.

25:39.320 --> 25:43.280
 So I want to get this for Elon because I saw him making a comment about this a few weeks

25:43.280 --> 25:44.440
 ago on Twitter.

25:44.440 --> 25:45.960
 He said that it's wrong for the government.

25:45.960 --> 25:49.000
 Effectively, it seems wrong for the government to always be in deficit.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
 Okay.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.400
 Now, when you look at it and say, well, how is money created?

25:54.400 --> 25:59.440
 How does money come about when it's not a commodity like gold, which you dig up out

25:59.440 --> 26:03.840
 of the ground, when it's actually social relations between people that create money?

26:03.840 --> 26:11.360
 Well, money is the, fundamentally, the liabilities of the banking sector.

26:11.360 --> 26:16.120
 If we make a transfer between us, your deposit account goes down.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.520
 My deposit account goes up.

26:18.520 --> 26:23.600
 Posit exchange is on the liability side of the banking sector.

26:23.600 --> 26:28.080
 But if we have a transaction with the bank, then if the bank lends us money, its assets,

26:28.080 --> 26:32.080
 loans go up, its deposits go up, again, that same balance.

26:32.080 --> 26:36.640
 So you've got to look and say money, therefore, is fundamentally the liabilities of the banking

26:36.640 --> 26:37.640
 sector.

26:37.640 --> 26:40.440
 So how do you create, create additional liabilities?

26:40.440 --> 26:45.720
 You must have an operation which occurs both on the liability side and the asset side of

26:45.720 --> 26:46.880
 the banking sector.

26:46.880 --> 26:53.480
 So if you and I make a transaction, no money is created, money, existing money is redistributed.

26:53.480 --> 26:57.600
 But if you go to a bank and buy, take out a bank loan, then money is created by the

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
 bank loan.

26:58.600 --> 27:02.960
 So the liabilities of the banking sector rise, the assets rise, their balance, but more liabilities

27:02.960 --> 27:05.280
 means, or the banking sector means more money.

27:05.280 --> 27:06.280
 Okay.

27:06.280 --> 27:08.960
 So that's what, that's how private banks create money.

27:08.960 --> 27:13.720
 And that's what I first started working on when I became an academic about, well, 35

27:13.720 --> 27:14.920
 years ago.

27:14.920 --> 27:19.520
 The actual dynamics of private money creation, but the government has the same sort of story.

27:19.520 --> 27:26.560
 If the government runs a deficit, it spends more money on the individuals in the economy

27:26.560 --> 27:31.440
 than it taxes them, which means their bank accounts increase.

27:31.440 --> 27:35.840
 So a government deficit creates money for the private sector.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.840
 Okay.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.320
 So that's where money creation occurs from the government.

27:39.320 --> 27:47.240
 So it puts more money into people's bank accounts by spending, by welfare payments than it takes

27:47.240 --> 27:49.080
 out by taxation.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.920
 So that's creating new money.

27:50.920 --> 27:55.760
 And then on the other side on the bank, the money turns up in the reserve accounts of

27:55.760 --> 28:00.480
 the banks, which are basically the private bank's bank accounts at the central bank.

28:00.480 --> 28:06.920
 So rather than the asset of private money creation being loans, the asset of government money

28:06.920 --> 28:09.520
 creation as reserves.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.520
 Okay.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.880
 Right.

28:11.880 --> 28:15.320
 Money creation is a good thing.

28:15.320 --> 28:19.160
 So you mentioned a bunch of stuff like private money creation with the liabilities in the

28:19.160 --> 28:24.080
 banks and then the how the government is doing the reserves, blah, blah, blah.

28:24.080 --> 28:28.480
 At the end of the day, there's a bunch of printers that are printing money.

28:28.480 --> 28:29.480
 What is money?

28:29.480 --> 28:33.680
 And then you also said something interesting, which is social relations between humans is

28:33.680 --> 28:35.480
 what creates money.

28:35.480 --> 28:40.400
 I think my mind was blown several times over the past minute.

28:40.400 --> 28:47.160
 So it's difficult for me to reconstruct the pieces of my mind back together, but basic

28:47.160 --> 28:50.920
 question is money creation a good thing or a bad thing?

28:50.920 --> 28:56.760
 Money creation is a good thing because money creation is what allows commerce to happen.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.360
 Isn't there a conservation of... No, there isn't.

28:59.360 --> 29:03.200
 I had an argument with physicists over this and it took me a long time to answer it.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.800
 They thought the sum total of all money is zero.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.800
 Yeah.

29:06.800 --> 29:07.800
 Okay.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.680
 It's the sum type of total of all assets and liabilities is zero.

29:10.680 --> 29:18.360
 So if you imagine your assets minus your liabilities is your equity and your asset is somebody else's

29:18.360 --> 29:23.400
 liability and your liability is somebody else's asset, when we're talking about financial assets

29:23.400 --> 29:27.880
 and this is another mind blowing thing that I've just recently solved myself.

29:27.880 --> 29:32.080
 So the sum total of all financial assets and liabilities is zero.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.080
 Okay.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.080
 Wait, wait, wait.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.000
 I'm going to interrupt you rudely.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.280
 What are assets?

29:37.280 --> 29:38.440
 What are liabilities?

29:38.440 --> 29:41.080
 Assets are your claims on somebody else.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.080
 Specific.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.560
 Give me an example of an asset.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.560
 Okay.

29:45.560 --> 29:46.880
 Do you have a mortgage for this house?

29:46.880 --> 29:47.880
 No.

29:47.880 --> 29:48.880
 I'm renting.

29:48.880 --> 29:49.880
 You're renting.

29:49.880 --> 29:50.880
 There you go.

29:50.880 --> 29:51.880
 Well, if you had a mortgage, that would be your liability.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.080
 That would be my liability.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.080
 Okay.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.560
 The mortgage with a bank's asset.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.560
 Right.

29:56.560 --> 29:57.560
 Okay.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.560
 If you add the two together, you get zero.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.560
 Okay.

29:59.560 --> 30:00.560
 So that's zero.

30:00.560 --> 30:01.560
 That's zero.

30:01.560 --> 30:10.400
 So the liability side of the banking sector, the assets on the other side can be either

30:10.400 --> 30:15.040
 created by the banking sector, which is where you get bank loans or created by the government

30:15.040 --> 30:16.640
 where you get reserves.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.760
 But money is the liabilities.

30:18.760 --> 30:23.800
 If you think about protons and anti protons, in that sense, money is like the anti proton.

30:23.800 --> 30:24.800
 It's the negative.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.800
 The liability.

30:25.800 --> 30:31.600
 Wait, wait, wait, the liability is the negative.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.600
 How's that money?

30:32.600 --> 30:33.880
 I thought money is the positive.

30:33.880 --> 30:37.880
 What is a liability for the banking sector is an asset for you and me.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.920
 An asset includes money.

30:39.920 --> 30:40.920
 Yeah.

30:40.920 --> 30:41.920
 Yeah.

30:41.920 --> 30:42.920
 Okay.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.360
 If you have a bank account, you'd have a bank account and you'd have some cash.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.360
 Okay.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.360
 Okay.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.360
 Those are your assets.

30:48.360 --> 30:53.560
 But the bank account is a liability of the banking sector and the cash is a liability

30:53.560 --> 30:55.040
 of the Federal Reserve.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.040
 Okay.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.040
 So what's money?

30:57.040 --> 31:04.320
 Well, money is the promise of a third party that we both accept to close our transaction.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.320
 And that's a bank?

31:05.320 --> 31:06.320
 That's a bank.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.320
 Yeah.

31:07.320 --> 31:12.000
 This is one of the most important works I've ever read is a work by a wonderful, now unfortunately

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
 deceased, Italian economist called Augusto Graziani.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.160
 And he's the most wonderful personality.

31:20.160 --> 31:26.120
 Augusto, I've met him on a few occasions, is one of the few human beings who can speak

31:26.120 --> 31:31.240
 in perfectly formed paragraphs, okay, superbly eloquent.

31:31.240 --> 31:36.040
 And what he did was write a paper called The Monetary Theory of Production.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.160
 You can find it downloaded on the web.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.600
 It's pretty much open source now.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.440
 And what he said is, what distinguishes a monetary economy from a barter economy?

31:45.440 --> 31:51.000
 So he said, in a barter economy, what we do is, I'll give you two of these for one

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
 of those.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
 Yeah.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
 Okay, barter.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.560
 Just working at a relative price, there are two of us involved and there are two commodities.

31:57.560 --> 32:02.440
 So with money, money is a triangular transaction, okay?

32:02.440 --> 32:08.520
 There is one commodity, I want to buy that can of drink off you, two people.

32:08.520 --> 32:14.000
 And the price that's worked out ends up being in a transfer from the promises to pay the

32:14.000 --> 32:19.240
 bank that the buyer has to the promises to pay the bank that the seller has.

32:19.240 --> 32:26.360
 So what you have is a monetary transaction in a capitalist economy involves three agents,

32:26.360 --> 32:28.160
 the buyer, the seller, and the bank.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.000
 So the bank always has to be part of it?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.160
 Well, the bank has to be part of it.

32:32.160 --> 32:37.600
 When I hand you the money, you accept that as you've now got, rather than it's the bank

32:37.600 --> 32:41.320
 promising to pay me something, it's now the bank promising to pay you something.

32:41.320 --> 32:46.040
 And we exchange the promises of banks, and that's fundamentally money.

32:46.040 --> 32:52.680
 So money is fundamentally a threesome and everybody gets fucked, is that a good way

32:52.680 --> 32:53.680
 to put it?

32:53.680 --> 32:54.680
 No.

32:54.680 --> 32:55.680
 I'm just kidding.

32:55.680 --> 32:58.000
 Now I know I can use French in this conversation, that's good.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.600
 That's not French, that's a different language, I'll explain it to you one day.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.760
 You Australians will never understand.

33:05.760 --> 33:09.360
 Okay, if I can return, we'll jump around if it's okay.

33:09.360 --> 33:10.360
 Oh, it's fine.

33:10.360 --> 33:18.440
 So you mentioned Karl Marx as one of the great intellects, economic thinkers ever.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.440
 Yeah.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.040
 He might be number one.

33:21.040 --> 33:26.080
 You study him quite a bit, you disagree with him quite a bit, but you still think he's

33:26.080 --> 33:28.080
 a powerful thinker.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.320
 A powerful mind.

33:29.320 --> 33:30.480
 A powerful mind.

33:30.480 --> 33:36.760
 So first of all, let's just explore the human.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.040
 Why do you say so?

33:38.040 --> 33:40.120
 What's interesting in that mind?

33:40.120 --> 33:45.160
 In the way he saw the world, what are the insights that you find brilliant?

33:45.160 --> 33:54.360
 Marx once described his major workers towards a critical examination of everything existing.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.160
 So he's a modest bastard.

33:56.160 --> 34:00.000
 So he wanted to understand and criticize everything.

34:00.000 --> 34:08.240
 And even he wasn't trained directly by Hegel, but his teachers were Hegelian philosophers.

34:08.240 --> 34:12.760
 And what Hegel developed was a concept called dialectics.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.560
 And dialectics is a philosophy of change.

34:15.560 --> 34:21.560
 And when most people hear the word dialectics, they come up with this unpronounceable trio

34:21.560 --> 34:25.760
 of words called thesis, antithesis, synthesis.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.040
 I can barely get the words out myself.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.480
 And that actually is not Hegel at all.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.480
 That's another German philosopher.

34:30.480 --> 34:31.480
 Can't.

34:31.480 --> 34:32.480
 Ficht.

34:32.480 --> 34:33.480
 Oh, I thought it was Kant.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.480
 No, Ficht.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.480
 Well, I'm not sure.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.480
 You could be...

34:36.480 --> 34:39.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:39.720 --> 34:42.960
 So but if you look at this beautiful book called Marx and Contradiction, you want to

34:42.960 --> 34:45.840
 find a great explanation for Marx's philosophy.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.840
 I forgot the author.

34:46.840 --> 34:50.960
 I think it's Wilde, W I L D E, Marx and Contradiction.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.880
 And he points out the actual origins of Marx's philosophy.

34:53.880 --> 34:56.120
 I didn't know that when I first read Marx.

34:56.120 --> 35:03.480
 So I became exposed to Marx when I was a student at Sydney University and we'd had a strike

35:03.480 --> 35:06.840
 at the university over the teaching of philosophy.

35:06.840 --> 35:11.320
 And what happened was the philosophy department had a lot of radical philosophers in it and

35:11.320 --> 35:13.960
 a conservative chief philosopher.

35:13.960 --> 35:19.360
 And the radicals wanted to have a course in what they called feminist aspects of philosophical

35:19.360 --> 35:22.720
 thought, sorry, philosophical aspects of feminist thought.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.200
 And the staff voted in favor of it.

35:24.200 --> 35:27.640
 This is back in the days when university departments were democratic.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.040
 The professor opposed it.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.240
 He got it blocked at a high level.

35:30.240 --> 35:34.600
 The staff leopthrogged over that and then finally the vice chancellor blocked it.

35:34.600 --> 35:39.400
 So that led to a strike over the teaching of philosophy at Sydney University, which

35:39.400 --> 35:43.680
 at one stage over pretty over half the students were on strike.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.680
 Okay.

35:44.680 --> 35:48.600
 Economics began out of that of a teaching of a philosophy of feminism.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.600
 Yes.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.600
 That's good.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.240
 That's such a different life to what we're living now.

35:53.240 --> 35:59.800
 That's the academic milieu in which I developed all my ideas and I had become a critic.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.720
 I've gone from being a believer of mainstream economics when I was a first year student

36:03.720 --> 36:06.640
 to disbelieving at halfway through first year.

36:06.640 --> 36:07.640
 Okay.

36:07.640 --> 36:11.280
 And I then spent a long time trying to change it, getting nowhere.

36:11.280 --> 36:15.360
 And then this philosophy strike happened and we took it on in economics and we formed

36:15.360 --> 36:19.840
 what's called the political economy movement and had a successful strike.

36:19.840 --> 36:25.520
 We actually managed to pressure the university into establishing a department of political

36:25.520 --> 36:29.000
 economy at Sydney University as well as the department of economics.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.680
 What was the foundational ideas?

36:30.680 --> 36:37.120
 Were you resistant to the whole censorship of why can't you have a philosophy of anything

36:37.120 --> 36:38.120
 kind of course?

36:38.120 --> 36:44.560
 Well, it was much more libertarian in the genuine sense of the word period of time.

36:44.560 --> 36:49.600
 At the end of the 60s, beginning of the 70s, then the word libertarian has been corrupted

36:49.600 --> 36:54.040
 since then, but it really was about free thought and you went to university to learn.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.040
 It was about education.

36:55.040 --> 36:59.240
 I remember having a fight with my father once where dad was angry about the marks I was

36:59.240 --> 37:02.880
 getting for some of my courses and he said, if you don't get a decent result, you won't

37:02.880 --> 37:03.880
 get a decent job.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.880
 And I said, I'm not here to get a job, I'm here to get an education.

37:06.880 --> 37:07.880
 Oh, wow.

37:07.880 --> 37:11.480
 Now the thing is ultimately it's been a pretty good job for me as well.

37:11.480 --> 37:16.160
 This is in Sydney, by the way, and Sydney in summer is absolutely gorgeous.

37:16.160 --> 37:20.160
 And what does a bunch of lefties decide to do during summer but read Karl Marx?

37:20.160 --> 37:21.160
 Yeah.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.160
 On the beach or?

37:22.160 --> 37:27.440
 Actually, inside the room of the philosophy department at the University of Sydney in

37:27.440 --> 37:28.440
 the main quadrangle.

37:28.440 --> 37:32.840
 There is sandstone all around us and we have a bunch of about 20 or 30 of us reading our

37:32.840 --> 37:33.840
 way through Marx.

37:33.840 --> 37:38.520
 Ah, Kapital League, which is the volume one capital.

37:38.520 --> 37:46.000
 And I remember walking off to that meeting with one of my friends, who's a law student,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.760
 and this was a period of a huge construction boom in Sydney.

37:49.760 --> 37:54.200
 So the whole skyline, which we could see from the campus, was full of what they call kangaroo

37:54.200 --> 37:58.640
 cranes, which were an Australian invention, that are cranes that can be leapfrogged over

37:58.640 --> 38:00.880
 each other to build a skyscraper.

38:00.880 --> 38:05.680
 So here you are reading Karl Marx, looking at the mechanisms of capital.

38:05.680 --> 38:09.720
 And I looked at those mechanisms and I knew Marx argued that labor was the only source

38:09.720 --> 38:10.720
 of value.

38:10.720 --> 38:11.720
 Yeah.

38:11.720 --> 38:12.720
 And he said machinery doesn't add value.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.720
 So the cranes are worthless.

38:14.720 --> 38:18.200
 I'm looking at these cranes and thinking, I want a very good explanation by Marx as to

38:18.200 --> 38:20.400
 why these cranes don't add value.

38:20.400 --> 38:24.640
 So reading through the first seven chapters of capital, what you found was Marx applying

38:24.640 --> 38:28.960
 this dialectic and like the Fictian stuff is bullshit, that is not how Marx thought

38:28.960 --> 38:29.960
 it all.

38:29.960 --> 38:34.240
 I was reading trying to find the thesis antithesis, synthesis, and it's not there at all in any

38:34.240 --> 38:35.240
 of Marx's works.

38:35.240 --> 38:42.560
 And I've read everything he's ever written on economics from 1844 to 1894 and his last

38:42.560 --> 38:43.560
 books were published.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.440
 There's not one more definition of that.

38:45.440 --> 38:49.480
 What he does talk about is foreground and background and tension.

38:49.480 --> 38:57.240
 And his idea of a dialectic is that there is a unity will exist in society and that

38:57.240 --> 39:01.200
 unity can be an individual, there can be a commodity, anything at all.

39:01.200 --> 39:05.440
 The unity will be understood by that society.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.360
 One particular aspect will be focused upon.

39:07.360 --> 39:13.160
 So if you think about the human being in capitalism, the focus on the human being as an object

39:13.160 --> 39:15.720
 is their capacity to work.

39:15.720 --> 39:16.720
 You're a worker.

39:16.720 --> 39:19.800
 That's put in the foreground.

39:19.800 --> 39:23.280
 The fact that you're human and you want to play a guitar and go surfing and make love

39:23.280 --> 39:27.320
 and all the other things that humans do is pushed into the background.

39:27.320 --> 39:33.320
 There's a tension between the two of those and that can transform that unity over time.

39:33.320 --> 39:37.640
 And that's a beautiful dynamic vision of change.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.000
 So dialectics is a philosophy of change.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.600
 So synthesis and synthesis is what does every idea have a counterargument?

39:45.600 --> 39:46.600
 Yeah.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.720
 There's a positive and negative and you bring them together somehow.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.400
 And then Marx has this foreground and background and tension.

39:52.400 --> 39:56.920
 Foreground is all what we think of as economics and background is all the love making we do

39:56.920 --> 39:57.920
 as humans.

39:57.920 --> 39:58.920
 That sort of thing.

39:58.920 --> 40:01.360
 And why is there a tension?

40:01.360 --> 40:07.640
 Because if you mention the unity, like if you take a human in any preview, like if you

40:07.640 --> 40:12.520
 go back to Chromagnon days and when we're living in caves and we've got to go hunting

40:12.520 --> 40:17.000
 and cook food and stuff like that, but there's no social hierarchy.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
 We've become used to.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.480
 So you don't get labored as a worker or a capitalist.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.720
 You're just a human in that situation.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.320
 Then you've got more an integrated view of who you are.

40:26.320 --> 40:30.320
 And I think that's one of the appeals of a tribal, a genuine tribal culture that you

40:30.320 --> 40:32.480
 get treated for the whole of who you are.

40:32.480 --> 40:36.320
 You've certainly categorized your male, your female, your young, your old.

40:36.320 --> 40:39.400
 You're a hunter, you're a tool maker, et cetera, et cetera.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.700
 But you're treated as more an integrated object.

40:41.700 --> 40:46.080
 When you get put in a complex society like a capitalist society, then one side of you

40:46.080 --> 40:48.920
 is emphasized and the others are deemphasized.

40:48.920 --> 40:54.480
 So is it fair to say that the background is like our basic fundamental humanity and the

40:54.480 --> 40:56.840
 foreground is the machine of capitalism?

40:56.840 --> 40:57.840
 Effectively.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.720
 And when you look at it in terms of a human, but what Marx did is apply this to a commodity.

41:01.720 --> 41:07.260
 So he said, what is the essential unity in a capitalist economy and the essential unity

41:07.260 --> 41:08.760
 is a commodity.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.400
 That's the essential unit.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.400
 The essential unity.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.400
 What's the unity?

41:12.400 --> 41:15.040
 The unity is an object in society.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.040
 Okay.

41:16.040 --> 41:20.240
 So he started from the point of view of trying to understand what, how exchange occurs.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.240
 How do we set prices?

41:21.240 --> 41:28.720
 And he's starting vision was to say that a commodity is a unity in a capitalist economy.

41:28.720 --> 41:35.280
 The part of the unity that we focus upon is the exchange value.

41:35.280 --> 41:41.200
 A capitalist produces a commodity, not because of its qualitative characteristics, but because

41:41.200 --> 41:43.080
 it'd be sold for a profit.

41:43.080 --> 41:47.040
 So the foreground aspect of a commodity is its exchange value.

41:47.040 --> 41:52.720
 The background aspect of it, it won't succeed as a commodity unless it has a use value.

41:52.720 --> 41:55.240
 So the background is the utility thing.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.240
 Yeah.

41:56.240 --> 42:01.720
 If you made something which didn't work, okay, then it has, you might be able to sell it,

42:01.720 --> 42:05.440
 but it has no utility that can't, you can't make that an all commodity, a broken thing

42:05.440 --> 42:06.440
 can't be sold.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.440
 Does that have the subjective?

42:07.440 --> 42:08.440
 Yeah.

42:08.440 --> 42:12.200
 It has to have the subjective side as well as the objective.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.960
 So the objective is what capitalists worry about.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.240
 I'll give you my favorite counter example of that.

42:16.240 --> 42:21.080
 I was in, I took a bunch of Australian journalists to China way back in the period when the Gang

42:21.080 --> 42:24.000
 of Four was being on trial.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.360
 And we did a tour of the Forbidden City in Beijing.

42:28.360 --> 42:33.240
 And at that stage, all the artifacts of the royal family, the emperor, were actually in

42:33.240 --> 42:34.240
 the building still.

42:34.240 --> 42:36.040
 And we walked past one of them.

42:36.040 --> 42:42.520
 And it was this gold, solid gold bar about this long, shaped like a fist, turned over

42:42.520 --> 42:43.520
 like this.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.480
 And on this side, there were rubies, emeralds, diamonds.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.480
 You'd never seen gemstones.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.880
 I mean, gems that big, okay.

42:49.880 --> 42:52.680
 And one of the journalists asked me what I thought it was, and I said, oh, it's obvious.

42:52.680 --> 42:53.920
 Jane is a back scratcher.

42:53.920 --> 42:59.000
 I walked away, she caught up with me about 20 minutes later, I asked one of the guards,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.440
 it is a back scratcher.

43:01.440 --> 43:06.000
 So here's a back scratcher for the emperor made of solid gold with diamonds and rubies

43:06.000 --> 43:07.960
 and emeralds during the scratching.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.880
 And that's a commodity in a feudal society.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.360
 The cost doesn't matter.

43:13.360 --> 43:16.840
 You want the most elaborate, beautiful thing because you're the emperor.

43:16.840 --> 43:23.040
 So in that feudal society, the commodity, what's focused upon is the utility and the cost

43:23.040 --> 43:26.480
 of production when you're the emperor is immaterial.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.240
 Capitalism reverses that.

43:28.240 --> 43:34.160
 So the commodity in a capitalist economy is a plastic $2 scratchy you can get from Kmart

43:34.160 --> 43:35.840
 or Target.

43:35.840 --> 43:42.360
 And so the use value is necessary, but irrelevant to forming the price.

43:42.360 --> 43:47.560
 Now, that was a completely different vision of exchange in capitalism to what I found

43:47.560 --> 43:52.440
 in the neoclassical theory, because that says it's the marginal utility and the marginal

43:52.440 --> 43:57.000
 cost of everything that determines the exchange ratio.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.560
 And the crazy thing about that is not so much the marginal utility, but the argument in

44:02.560 --> 44:07.440
 the neoclassical theory is that the price ratio, the price will, when there's an exchange

44:07.440 --> 44:14.360
 going on, there's two person, two commodity exchange of two commodities between two people,

44:14.360 --> 44:20.880
 they will change, the price will change until such time as the ratio of the marginal utilities

44:20.880 --> 44:25.160
 is equal to the ratio of the marginal costs, that's supposed to be the equilibrium.

44:25.160 --> 44:27.160
 And Marx says, that's bullshit.

44:27.160 --> 44:33.000
 That's a previous society where you exchange stuff that you happen to have for stuff somebody

44:33.000 --> 44:37.360
 else happened to have without any real production mechanism being involved.

44:37.360 --> 44:41.640
 And he said, that's like when you have an eight to ancient tribe or two tribes meeting

44:41.640 --> 44:46.240
 for the very first time, and one tribe can make something the other tribe can't make

44:46.240 --> 44:52.320
 and they will therefore, the price they were willing to pay reflect how unique this other

44:52.320 --> 44:55.480
 object is that this one tribe can make and the other can't.

44:55.480 --> 45:00.360
 So for example, the story of Manhattan being sold for 40 glass beads, it's actually 40

45:00.360 --> 45:03.960
 glass trading beads, I believe it is a true story.

45:03.960 --> 45:07.680
 But the thing is the Indians couldn't make glass beads.

45:07.680 --> 45:12.400
 So they valued the glass beads and said the island of Manhattan, which is a utility based

45:12.400 --> 45:13.400
 comparison.

45:13.400 --> 45:19.160
 What Marx said, that's the very initial contact over time, even if you don't know the technology,

45:19.160 --> 45:23.800
 over time you start to realize how much work goes involved to making what they're selling

45:23.800 --> 45:26.680
 you versus what you're selling to them.

45:26.680 --> 45:29.920
 And you start making stuff specifically for sale.

45:29.920 --> 45:37.040
 So Elon's not losing personal utility each time a Model 3 goes out the door.

45:37.040 --> 45:41.360
 He might get utility out of the fact that he's created that vehicle, that concept and

45:41.360 --> 45:45.560
 manufactures it and so on, but he's not losing utility each time a Model T Ford goes out the

45:45.560 --> 45:50.360
 door for going back for the ancient commodity there.

45:50.360 --> 45:57.840
 So the utility plays no role in setting price in Marx's model, whereas it's essential in

45:57.840 --> 45:58.840
 the neoclassical model.

45:58.840 --> 46:02.000
 What's the difference between utility and marginal utility?

46:02.000 --> 46:06.360
 What does the word marginal mean and why is this such a problem?

46:06.360 --> 46:11.640
 It turns marginal utility, the utility itself has different meanings than the two schools

46:11.640 --> 46:12.640
 of thought.

46:12.640 --> 46:16.680
 If you take the classical school of thought, which when Marx comes from, utility is effectively

46:16.680 --> 46:18.180
 objective.

46:18.180 --> 46:22.840
 So the utility of a chair is that you can sit in it, not how comfortable it makes you

46:22.840 --> 46:23.840
 feel.

46:23.840 --> 46:28.160
 Now, if you think about the utility of the chairs, we're both sitting and they're identical

46:28.160 --> 46:30.760
 from a classical point of view, we're both sitting.

46:30.760 --> 46:34.360
 But from a neoclassical point of view, it's how comfortable it makes you feel.

46:34.360 --> 46:37.920
 And that depends upon your subjective feelings of comfort.

46:37.920 --> 46:42.080
 You might be far more comfortable in the identical chair that I'm sitting in than I am.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.040
 And therefore, the comparison is difficult.

46:44.040 --> 46:49.640
 And therefore, working out a ratio involves you've got a decline in your each time you

46:49.640 --> 46:57.160
 give away a chair in exchange for an iPhone, you have a fall in your utility.

46:57.160 --> 47:02.200
 But and then therefore, you want a higher return because you're losing more utility

47:02.200 --> 47:06.080
 each time, the more chairs you give away, the less utility you're getting from chairs.

47:06.080 --> 47:08.600
 So there's a decline in your utility.

47:08.600 --> 47:11.040
 That's your marginal utility.

47:11.040 --> 47:15.360
 So it's including your subjective valuation in setting the price.

47:15.360 --> 47:20.480
 And what Marx pointed out is this is a caricature of actual change in a capitalist economy.

47:20.480 --> 47:25.360
 Because we have in a capitalist economy, huge factories turning out huge quantities specifically

47:25.360 --> 47:26.360
 for sale.

47:26.360 --> 47:31.200
 They've got no utility to the seller unless they're sold.

47:31.200 --> 47:36.160
 So it's a very different vision of how prices set.

47:36.160 --> 47:42.400
 And Marx used that to explain where profit comes from, but he made a mistake.

47:42.400 --> 47:49.080
 And his argument was that talking about a worker, as now your unity, the foreground

47:49.080 --> 47:54.560
 background tension thing, the foreground is that you hire a worker for their cost of

47:54.560 --> 47:59.120
 production and the cost of production is a subsistence wage.

47:59.120 --> 48:05.840
 The utility to the buyer is the fact that they can work in a factory.

48:05.840 --> 48:10.640
 Now, it might take six hours, let's say, to make the means of subsistence.

48:10.640 --> 48:14.840
 And that's the exchange value, and that's what the capitalist pays as a wage to the

48:14.840 --> 48:15.840
 worker.

48:15.840 --> 48:18.360
 But they can work in the factory for 12 hours.

48:18.360 --> 48:19.880
 That's the utility.

48:19.880 --> 48:24.760
 12 minus six is six surplus of value hours.

48:24.760 --> 48:26.240
 And that's where profit comes from.

48:26.240 --> 48:27.920
 And that was Marx's argument.

48:27.920 --> 48:31.800
 And I thought it was brilliant, but it also applied to machinery.

48:31.800 --> 48:32.800
 Right.

48:32.800 --> 48:33.800
 Okay.

48:33.800 --> 48:34.800
 Let's blink on that.

48:34.800 --> 48:35.800
 Hold on.

48:35.800 --> 48:36.800
 I said, no, no.

48:36.800 --> 48:37.800
 Deep is good.

48:37.800 --> 48:38.800
 Just wanted to find terms.

48:38.800 --> 48:42.880
 Don't take that statement out of context, the internet, please.

48:42.880 --> 48:44.080
 Okay.

48:44.080 --> 48:52.880
 You said buyer, seller, worker in a factory, who's the seller, who's the buyer?

48:52.880 --> 48:55.800
 Why is the worker the buyer?

48:55.800 --> 48:59.800
 Well, the worker's the commodity in this case, because if you're going to make stuff in a

48:59.800 --> 49:01.520
 factory, you've got to hire workers.

49:01.520 --> 49:02.520
 Yes.

49:02.520 --> 49:03.520
 Okay.

49:03.520 --> 49:06.120
 And what Marx is saying, the buyer in that situation is a capitalist.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.640
 So what does the buyer pay?

49:07.640 --> 49:09.440
 He says he pays the exchange value.

49:09.440 --> 49:13.040
 That's, they'll get back to the commodity thing, because that's the starting point.

49:13.040 --> 49:17.160
 He said the essential unity in a capitalist economy is the commodity.

49:17.160 --> 49:21.360
 A commodity has two characteristics, exchange value and use value.

49:21.360 --> 49:22.360
 Okay.

49:22.360 --> 49:27.080
 The exchange value of a commodity in a capitalist economy will be its cost of production.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.600
 The use value is what you do with it.

49:29.600 --> 49:30.600
 Okay.

49:30.600 --> 49:31.600
 Once you've purchased it.

49:31.600 --> 49:34.080
 But labor is a commodity?

49:34.080 --> 49:38.280
 In this case, when a worker is being hired for a job, yes.

49:38.280 --> 49:43.680
 So the worker's labor has an exchange value and a use value as well?

49:43.680 --> 49:44.680
 Yeah.

49:44.680 --> 49:45.680
 Use value.

49:45.680 --> 49:50.560
 Use value of a worker's labor, exchange value.

49:50.560 --> 49:54.280
 Let me think about that.

49:54.280 --> 49:58.520
 So the hours they put in is the use value.

49:58.520 --> 49:59.920
 Interesting.

49:59.920 --> 50:05.000
 So what does the worker want in this?

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
 What are the motivations?

50:06.000 --> 50:09.680
 Are we not considering the worker in this context as a human being?

50:09.680 --> 50:14.000
 Well, you come and then that's actually, that's the next layer.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.440
 What Marx give us is like a layered cake, starting from a foundation of saying straight

50:19.440 --> 50:23.920
 commodity exchange, and then saying, well, you're treating a worker as a commodity.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.560
 Now a commodity is something like this.

50:26.560 --> 50:27.560
 Okay.

50:27.560 --> 50:30.000
 That has, so far as I'm aware, no soul.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
 Okay.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
 Yeah.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
 Not going to be a complaint if I turn it upside down.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
 It'll fall over.

50:34.000 --> 50:39.600
 So there's no soul there as a human is both a commodity and a non commodity.

50:39.600 --> 50:43.040
 And therefore there'll be a tension in the person, I'm being treated as a commodity here.

50:43.040 --> 50:46.120
 I'm being paid just enough to stay alive.

50:46.120 --> 50:48.760
 I've got a wife and kids back at home.

50:48.760 --> 50:54.360
 So that is another layer of thinking in Marx and on that later he then says, well, workers

50:54.360 --> 50:57.000
 will therefore demand more than their value.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.800
 So that's when you get like political.

50:58.800 --> 51:02.640
 You get political and you get money coming above that and so on, but the basic idea starts

51:02.640 --> 51:07.240
 from the commodities, the fundamental unity in capitalism.

51:07.240 --> 51:12.320
 The important commodity in Marx's thinking was the worker because that's where he said

51:12.320 --> 51:13.480
 profit came from.

51:13.480 --> 51:14.480
 Yeah.

51:14.480 --> 51:15.480
 Okay.

51:15.480 --> 51:17.720
 And then that explains the motivation of the capitalist and that ultimately is the

51:17.720 --> 51:23.280
 labor theory of value and Marx's arguments about how capitalism will come to an end.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.280
 Okay.

51:24.280 --> 51:25.280
 Okay.

51:25.280 --> 51:27.800
 So first of all, what is the labor theory of value?

51:27.800 --> 51:30.680
 And actually before that, what is value?

51:30.680 --> 51:35.440
 Is that, this is like me asking what's happiness?

51:35.440 --> 51:38.440
 Is there something interesting to say about trying to define value?

51:38.440 --> 51:39.440
 You vary.

51:39.440 --> 51:45.240
 And this is a huge problem in economics is arguments over what does value mean?

51:45.240 --> 51:48.480
 And the neoclassicals came down as that it's subjective.

51:48.480 --> 51:54.080
 It's value is whatever you get out of it, but it's your personal evaluation of something,

51:54.080 --> 51:55.520
 your personal feelings.

51:55.520 --> 51:58.760
 So they've got that very subjective idea of value.

51:58.760 --> 52:04.600
 Whereas the Marxists and being inherited as the classical school talking to us of objective

52:04.600 --> 52:06.440
 value.

52:06.440 --> 52:11.240
 So the value is the number of hours it takes to make something or the effort, the value

52:11.240 --> 52:15.400
 is, value is the effort that goes into making something in the classical school.

52:15.400 --> 52:18.120
 That's just one measure of objective.

52:18.120 --> 52:19.120
 Where do you fall?

52:19.120 --> 52:20.120
 Huh?

52:20.120 --> 52:21.120
 Where do you fall?

52:21.120 --> 52:25.640
 I fall on subjective versus objective spectrum.

52:25.640 --> 52:30.400
 I think you have to have the capacity to move between one and the other in a structured

52:30.400 --> 52:31.400
 way.

52:31.400 --> 52:32.400
 The king model of value.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.400
 Yeah.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.400
 Well, my base model is the objective.

52:34.400 --> 52:35.400
 Yeah.

52:35.400 --> 52:40.280
 But above that, as soon as you start talking, you did about the worker, for example.

52:40.280 --> 52:47.320
 When you get involved in the subjectivity, because a worker will be angry and justifiably

52:47.320 --> 52:53.240
 so about being treated as a commodity, because I'm not a commodity, I'm a human being.

52:53.240 --> 52:58.400
 And that's where Marx or political organization coming from.

52:58.400 --> 52:59.920
 And that's subjective now.

52:59.920 --> 53:04.680
 And then when you get to money itself, Marx actually said, well, what's the value of money?

53:04.680 --> 53:08.880
 Now, if you use an objective theory of value, you would solve the cost of money, the value

53:08.880 --> 53:11.480
 of money is its cost of production.

53:11.480 --> 53:12.960
 What's the cost of producing a dollar?

53:12.960 --> 53:15.120
 It's about two cents.

53:15.120 --> 53:17.200
 So he said, it can't be.

53:17.200 --> 53:20.440
 The value of money cannot be its cost of production.

53:20.440 --> 53:25.200
 Or there must value, I think, if I remember the phrase properly, is value here as it must

53:25.200 --> 53:33.200
 mean the effect of the uncertain expectations or subjective valuation?

53:33.200 --> 53:35.080
 Uncertain expectations or subjective valuation.

53:35.080 --> 53:36.080
 Okay.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.080
 But he's okay with that?

53:37.080 --> 53:41.440
 Because he could move between different levels, because he's had a structured foundation of

53:41.440 --> 53:49.240
 this dialectical vision of foreground, background tension, commodity having use value, exchange

53:49.240 --> 53:54.680
 value and a gap between the two when you're talking about machines, when you're buying

53:54.680 --> 53:56.160
 stuff for production.

53:56.160 --> 54:00.640
 And then at the next level, he could look at workers, worker organization and say that's

54:00.640 --> 54:04.880
 driven by being treated as a commodity when you're a non commodity.

54:04.880 --> 54:13.560
 So the basic labor theory of value that is described to Karl Marx is that value at the

54:13.560 --> 54:19.920
 base layer fundamentally comes from the labor you put into something.

54:19.920 --> 54:26.040
 And you say, well, there's some deep truth there, except he misses one fundamental point,

54:26.040 --> 54:30.360
 which is machines can also bring value to the world.

54:30.360 --> 54:32.760
 He was saying they don't.

54:32.760 --> 54:38.680
 It was the only thing that matters is human labor, not labor.

54:38.680 --> 54:45.080
 How do you measure what's the role of the whatever value machines bring to the world?

54:45.080 --> 54:51.200
 This is another intriguing history because Marx when he first started had what you can

54:51.200 --> 54:57.560
 call an exclusivist explanation for why labor created value.

54:57.560 --> 55:03.520
 And that was to say that the labor is the only commodity with both what he called commodity

55:03.520 --> 55:05.440
 and commodity power.

55:05.440 --> 55:09.080
 So you have labor and labor power.

55:09.080 --> 55:13.920
 Labor is the, and I get fuzzy about this, I haven't read it for something like 30 years,

55:13.920 --> 55:16.960
 but labor has both commodity and commodity power.

55:16.960 --> 55:22.160
 The commodity is you can buy labor, which is the means of subsistence.

55:22.160 --> 55:25.240
 Labor power is the capacity to work inside a factory.

55:25.240 --> 55:29.640
 There's a difference between the two, therefore, that difference will give rise to surplus.

55:29.640 --> 55:34.240
 And there's no other commodity that has this essence of commodity and commodity power.

55:34.240 --> 55:36.400
 So that was his exclusivist argument.

55:36.400 --> 55:44.880
 In the middle of the 1857, he was visited by a guy called Otto Brow in his home in Chelsea.

55:44.880 --> 55:50.840
 And Otto returned to Marx a copy of Hegel's Phenomenology, I think it's called Phenomenology

55:50.840 --> 55:51.840
 of Right.

55:51.840 --> 55:53.440
 I haven't read it, but that's the book.

55:53.440 --> 55:58.600
 And Marx was then at this stage reading through all the classical theorists again.

55:58.600 --> 56:01.320
 And suddenly he read Hegel again.

56:01.320 --> 56:04.680
 And if you know Hunter S. Thompson, okay, okay.

56:04.680 --> 56:06.520
 Who doesn't know Hunter S. Thompson?

56:06.520 --> 56:09.320
 Somebody who hasn't had enough drugs, obviously, but Hunter S. Thompson.

56:09.320 --> 56:14.240
 He comes to you in a dream after you take your first, or whatever, then of course we've

56:14.240 --> 56:15.240
 evolved.

56:15.240 --> 56:19.080
 If you know your drugs well enough, you can tell, okay, he's stoned, okay, he's on cocaine.

56:19.080 --> 56:23.520
 Well, Marx suddenly, his writing style in the middle of a book called The Grandresa,

56:23.520 --> 56:24.520
 completely changed.

56:24.520 --> 56:26.000
 He switched from weed to cocaine.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.720
 He switched from Ricardo to Hegel, okay.

56:28.720 --> 56:33.240
 And what in Ricardo, he had this exclusivist argument about labor and suddenly Hegel is

56:33.240 --> 56:38.480
 back talking in terms of dialectics, not actually using a word, but foreground and background

56:38.480 --> 56:40.200
 and tension.

56:40.200 --> 56:44.880
 And then he, that's where this use value, exchange value, attention thing came from

56:44.880 --> 56:50.560
 is rereading Hegel 13 years after he stopped reading philosophy, because made in 44, he

56:50.560 --> 56:53.440
 was reading just the economists.

56:53.440 --> 56:55.720
 So you're saying Carl Marx is human after all.

56:55.720 --> 56:56.720
 He's human.

56:56.720 --> 56:57.720
 He could be involved.

56:57.720 --> 56:59.920
 I would love to have a beer with Carl for a while, for Carl.

56:59.920 --> 57:02.080
 He's Carl to you.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.560
 He's Mr. Marx to me.

57:03.560 --> 57:04.560
 Hang on.

57:04.560 --> 57:06.760
 Maybe Carl to me, I'm afraid, after all these years.

57:06.760 --> 57:09.480
 Yeah, yeah, you've had quite a journey together.

57:09.480 --> 57:14.840
 So that's where after Hegel, his interpretation of the dialects comes in the form of, but

57:14.840 --> 57:16.360
 foreground and background.

57:16.360 --> 57:20.320
 And then on page 267 of the Penguin edition of the Guindresa.

57:20.320 --> 57:21.320
 What really?

57:21.320 --> 57:22.320
 Your memory.

57:22.320 --> 57:24.320
 One and a half pages long footnote.

57:24.320 --> 57:28.720
 It's pretty hard to forget because when I did this, when I first read Marx way, way

57:28.720 --> 57:32.200
 back when I was, how old was I, 20?

57:32.200 --> 57:33.200
 Okay.

57:33.200 --> 57:38.560
 I tried to explain my explanation of Marx's use value, exchange value stuff to my colleagues

57:38.560 --> 57:43.240
 in this philosophy discussion room at Sydney University during a beautiful summer that

57:43.240 --> 57:47.400
 we are inside concrete sandstone walls discussing Marx.

57:47.400 --> 57:52.560
 And I went to say, look, the use value, exchange value argument can be applied to a machine.

57:52.560 --> 57:54.000
 What's the exchange value of a machine?

57:54.000 --> 57:55.640
 It's cost of manufacturing.

57:55.640 --> 57:56.840
 What's its use value?

57:56.840 --> 57:59.800
 Its capacity to produce goods for sale.

57:59.800 --> 58:01.080
 No relation between the two.

58:01.080 --> 58:02.080
 There'll be a gap.

58:02.080 --> 58:03.560
 A machine can be a source of profit.

58:03.560 --> 58:07.760
 Now I said that and I got laughed at, I'm quite literally laughed at.

58:07.760 --> 58:13.600
 So when I went back to university 13 years later to do a master's degree, I've chose

58:13.600 --> 58:18.640
 to read through and find in Marx where he first came across this insight.

58:18.640 --> 58:23.880
 So I made it, my first master's thesis failed, by the way, and justifiably so.

58:23.880 --> 58:29.800
 I was learning, I didn't know the level of academic discourse necessary.

58:29.800 --> 58:32.880
 I had an advisor who didn't understand what I was writing.

58:32.880 --> 58:39.480
 He got me to write for his New Keynesian audience and it was a mess and it got failed.

58:39.480 --> 58:40.480
 So I got rid of him.

58:40.480 --> 58:41.480
 Did it get failed?

58:41.480 --> 58:43.000
 Like, why do you think?

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
 It wasn't a good thesis.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.400
 It was, I didn't know the level.

58:46.400 --> 58:50.920
 It was written for an audience, my supervisor thought that I should be writing for.

58:50.920 --> 58:51.920
 And it was a mess.

58:51.920 --> 58:59.440
 And so I met another guy, Jeff Fishburne, as a lecturer at New South Wales University.

58:59.440 --> 59:04.560
 When Jeff was open minded, he was not a conventional neoclassical thinker.

59:04.560 --> 59:09.720
 And I realized, I'd throw out the half that Bill had got me to do, focused just on Marx.

59:09.720 --> 59:15.040
 And so I decided to read Marx in chronological sequence from his very first works of economics,

59:15.040 --> 59:18.880
 which are called the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844.

59:18.880 --> 59:23.760
 And he wrote those in a garret in Paris after he'd been expelled from Prussia.

59:23.760 --> 59:30.240
 And so he decided to read, having been an expert on philosophy and regarded as the towering

59:30.240 --> 59:36.360
 intellect of Hegelian philosophy in Prussia, but driven out because he was a radical.

59:36.360 --> 59:41.640
 He ended up writing a newspaper or being writing for a newspaper.

59:41.640 --> 59:46.880
 And he was reporting about the eviction of peasants from the forests, taking away their

59:46.880 --> 59:47.880
 feudal rights.

59:47.880 --> 59:53.040
 And so this is where his passion for economics and humanity came from.

59:53.040 --> 59:55.080
 And he was a poet as well.

59:55.080 --> 1:00:00.480
 I mean, he wrote love poetry to Genevon Westhalen, his first published works were pretty much

1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:01.480
 in poetry.

1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:05.200
 And he was a rouse about, he was a wild character.

1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:09.040
 We'd probably fight like crazy, I imagine, if we met.

1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:10.040
 Over the beers.

1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:16.680
 I'm slightly, even though I can be, I can get involved in an argument like nobody's

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:17.680
 business.

1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:18.680
 No, really?

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:19.680
 No, really.

1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:21.560
 But I'm a bit more peaceful of personality.

1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:23.280
 Why do you think Marx is feistier than you?

1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:27.560
 He was feisty, but feisty with, he could be arrogant.

1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:29.880
 Like I've got an intellectual arrogance.

1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:31.680
 I've come to accept that.

1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:33.880
 But there's like a fundamental humility to you.

1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:37.200
 You're saying Marx is like, has ego that's part of the control.

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:38.200
 A bit too big ego, yeah.

1:00:38.200 --> 1:00:39.200
 I'm guessing.

1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:40.680
 I mean, I'm never going to meet him.

1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:42.320
 Well, the beard says ego to me.

1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:43.600
 The beard is here, yeah.

1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:44.600
 That's here.

1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:45.600
 Okay.

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:46.840
 So this is interesting.

1:00:46.840 --> 1:00:51.120
 You went, chronologically, right through his work, the development of the human being through

1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:52.120
 his works.

1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:53.120
 Yeah.

1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:55.520
 And I was trying to find the point at which he discovered this use value exchange value

1:00:55.520 --> 1:00:56.520
 idea.

1:00:56.520 --> 1:01:02.560
 And it occurs in a footnote on page 267 to 268 of the Penguin edition of the Guindresa,

1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:07.240
 which his notes he was taking, literally not meant for publication, literally sitting

1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:13.640
 at a stall inside the British Museum, I think, reading all the classical authors in chronological

1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:18.960
 sequence, and then somebody throws Hegel at him, and suddenly he's talking in Hegelian

1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:19.960
 terms.

1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:25.000
 And he suddenly says, is not, because it's whole value issues, what is values, exchange

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.440
 value, use value, how do they relate to each other?

1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:28.440
 That's what he was thinking about.

1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:34.160
 And he said, is not use value, which was left out of the classical school, a fundamental

1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:36.280
 aspect of the commodity?

1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:39.840
 Is there not a tension between the use value and exchange value?

1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:44.360
 And so we're clear in that context, use value is kind of the subjective thing.

1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:46.120
 Exchange value is the objective thing.

1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:49.280
 And Marx was found a way to integrate the two.

1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:56.520
 He was focused on labor being the only thing that can generate both the use value and the

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:57.520
 exchange value.

1:01:57.520 --> 1:01:58.520
 But no.

1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:03.560
 If you look at the classical school, they focused on exchange value, objective.

1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:09.280
 Look at the neoclassical, they faces upon use value, subjective, or they call it utility.

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:14.920
 So Marx, coming from the Riccatiian tradition, basically dismissed the role of utility.

1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:20.480
 And then when he reads Hegel, he's suddenly starting to think in terms of unities and

1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:24.680
 exchange value and use value is the unity of the commodity.

1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:27.840
 And he thinks, well, I can't ignore use value.

1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.760
 So rather than leaving it out completely, which is what Riccato and Smith does, I've

1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:33.160
 got to somehow bring it in.

1:02:33.160 --> 1:02:35.680
 And this Hegelian insight occurs to him.

1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:37.360
 And it's remarkable.

1:02:37.360 --> 1:02:39.200
 I really recommend taking a look at the book.

1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:42.880
 And just to look at that particular page, because what it would have been as shown as

1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:49.480
 a footnote, but it would have been him saying, oh, wow, when he's asterisk, asterisk is not

1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:53.480
 use value, a fundamental aspect of the unity of a commodity.

1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:57.600
 So in the notes, you see the discovery of an idea in the human mind, the integration

1:02:57.600 --> 1:02:58.600
 of an idea.

1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:01.120
 And he actually writes, does this have significance in economics?

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:02.120
 Question mark.

1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:06.560
 And then he probably went home that night and like that, that idea changed.

1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:07.560
 Yeah.

1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:08.560
 It changed him completely.

1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:12.960
 And from that point on, his writing was completely different, but he still had this idea from

1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:17.840
 the Riccardian days of saying that labor is the only source of value using an exclusive

1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:21.840
 argument to say there's something unique about labor that explains why it's a source

1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:22.840
 of value.

1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:26.880
 But suddenly this insight occurs to him and he thinks, I can get a positive derivation.

1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:31.920
 I can use use value and exchange value and the fact they're not related to each other

1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:35.000
 as a dialectical tension to explain surplus value.

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:36.200
 And that's what he does.

1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:41.680
 So he goes from a negative explanation of where value comes from to a positive explanation

1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:48.000
 on that page of the Grand Risa, and he then triumphantly uses it to explain why labor

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.400
 is a source of value.

1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:53.760
 You buy it for its exchange value, you use its use value, they're unrelated, the use

1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:56.760
 value will be bigger, that's where profit comes from.

1:03:56.760 --> 1:04:01.160
 Then he does exactly the same thing for machinery, about 30 pages on.

1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:06.720
 He says, it also has to be contemplated, which was not done before.

1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:11.600
 This is wrote nice to himself, by the way, it's written in really in a colloquial style,

1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:16.600
 that the use value of a machine significantly greater than its exchange value, you actually

1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:17.720
 have to out the word is.

1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:22.960
 It's used, this is obviously to be a translation into English of the German, I'm sure.

1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:26.120
 I don't know, I haven't seen the original notes, I'd love to see them.

1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:29.160
 But he says, he lives out the word is.

1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:34.720
 It also has to be contemplated that the use value significantly greater than its exchange

1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:43.160
 value, i.e. that the contribution of the machine to production exceeds its depreciation.

1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:48.880
 That was an insight which undermined his explanation for revolution.

1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:52.480
 Can you say that again?

1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:56.280
 The cost of production exceeds its depreciation?

1:04:56.280 --> 1:04:58.640
 Can you linger on that?

1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:02.640
 Well, what Marx argued, and you read this in capital, and I read this in capital when

1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:08.640
 I first saw the contradiction in his own thought, he said that no matter how useful

1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:15.800
 the machine is, whether it took 100 hours to make or cost 150 pounds, it cannot under

1:05:15.800 --> 1:05:24.120
 any circumstances add more to production than 150 pounds, which in his old exclusivist

1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:31.480
 logic he could justify, and which in his post 1857 argument is bullshit.

1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:33.280
 Can you steelman his case?

1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:40.280
 Can we go to the mind of Marx in thinking if a machine costs 100 bucks, it can't be

1:05:40.280 --> 1:05:43.280
 ever more or more value than 100 bucks.

1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:49.720
 But that contradicts his previous logic, because what he said is, commodities are the essential

1:05:49.720 --> 1:05:52.360
 unity in capitalism.

1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:54.960
 Capitalism focuses upon the exchange value.

1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:59.840
 That pushes the use value into the background, and there's a tension between the two.

1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:04.200
 What that means is the exchange value of a commodity sets its price.

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:06.560
 The use value is independent.

1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:07.960
 He called them incommensurable.

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:13.360
 He literally used the word incommensurability between exchange value and a use value, whereas

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.480
 neoclassicals make them commensurable.

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:21.200
 So he's saying exchange value and use value are incommensurable, and that normally means

1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:25.240
 that exchange value is objective, like the number of hours it takes to make something.

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:30.240
 Use value is subjective, how comfortable the fact that you can sit in a chair.

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:31.240
 So that's incommensurability.

1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:36.800
 But when you apply it in production, the exchange value of something is objective.

1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:40.920
 It's how many hours it takes to make a machine, or how many hours it takes to make the means

1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:42.720
 of subsistence for a worker.

1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:44.880
 The use value is also objective.

1:06:44.880 --> 1:06:47.720
 You're making commodities for sale.

1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:53.840
 And the worker does six hours, six hours of work will make them the means of subsistence

1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:59.640
 for the worker, but the worker will work a 12 hour day, and the six hours becomes a gap.

1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:04.840
 Now that's incommensurability between use value and exchange value of labor.

1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:09.040
 But when you look at what he said about no matter how long it takes to make a machine

1:07:09.040 --> 1:07:14.000
 or how many pounds it costs, he's saying they're identical, and that's contradicting

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.000
 his own logic.

1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.880
 Well, what's the use value of a machine?

1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:23.320
 In fact, it can produce goods for sale, exactly the same as the worker.

1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:29.400
 Now what I, in my modern reinterpretation of Marx, which brings in my work on energy,

1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:36.520
 I see both labor and machinery as a means to harness energy and produce useful work.

1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:37.760
 And they can both do that.

1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:39.320
 In fact, they do it together.

1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:40.720
 It's a collective enterprise.

1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:47.320
 Okay, so, and we'll go to that, so there's no fundamental difference from an exchange

1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:50.240
 value and use value perspective between a human and a machine.

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:54.160
 And therefore, using the same logic, they can both be a source of surplus, which is

1:07:54.160 --> 1:08:01.240
 what Marx contradicted because his explanation for where socialism would come from is that

1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:03.680
 late profit comes only from labor.

1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:08.120
 Over time, we'll add more machinery than labor that will mean a falling rate of profit,

1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:11.120
 and therefore, a tendency towards socialism.

1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:16.360
 And what he did in that insight in 1857 is contradict his own idea about what would

1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:19.600
 lead to socialism, and he couldn't cope with it.

1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:30.240
 Okay, what's the difference between Marxian economics and Marxist political ideology?

1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:33.880
 The gap between the two, the overlap, the differences.

1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:39.320
 The real foundation of Marx's political philosophy was the economic argument that there would

1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:42.840
 be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall.

1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:48.440
 And that tendency for the rate of profit to fall would lead to capitalists batting down

1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:55.680
 on workers harder, paying them less than their subsistence, a revolt by workers against this,

1:08:55.680 --> 1:08:58.360
 and then you would get socialism on the other side.

1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:03.960
 So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall played a critical role in

1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:07.120
 his explanation for why socialism would have to come about.

1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:13.000
 He was saying, would it have to come about, or is it a good thing for it to come about?

1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.600
 He had assured, but he was trying to say it must.

1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:22.680
 So if you look at Marx in the history of radical thought, he was preceded by what were called

1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:29.680
 utopian socialists, Saint Simon, even the Cadbury's company came out of utopian socialist.

1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:33.800
 And they had an idea about a perfect society in the future where people were properly rewarded,

1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:38.360
 were treated as human beings rather than cogs in a machine, and all this sort of stuff.

1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:42.640
 And they said socialism should come about because it treats humans better than capitalism

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:43.640
 does.

1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:47.640
 Marx said, I can prove that socialism must come about.

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:53.240
 So he preferred, he had a utopian vision of a future society, but he thought he could

1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:55.040
 prove that it had to come about.

1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:01.680
 And the proof relied critically upon tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and that relied

1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:05.320
 upon labor being the only source of profit.

1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:07.760
 What was his utopian view?

1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:14.280
 So this idea from each according to his ability to each according to his needs, is that the

1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:15.280
 utopian?

1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:21.040
 I think it's utopian in the context of our modern world.

1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:27.320
 It says that you rather than being rewarded like Jeff Bezos gets enormous fortune, you

1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:33.560
 get what you need, not what you want, necessarily, all what all needs is fulfilled.

1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:38.160
 It was it was a vision of utopia where you could be a fisherman in the morning, a poet

1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:43.800
 in the afternoon, and a chef at night, okay, there's paraphrasing one of his phrases.

1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:48.280
 So he did have a utopian vision of a future society, and he did think human creativity

1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:52.320
 would be much, much greater under socialism than it was under capitalism.

1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:54.360
 He was wrong.

1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:57.120
 So let's explore in different ways where he was wrong.

1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:02.880
 You're saying there's a fundamental flaw in the logic, but also if we can link, if we

1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:10.120
 can explore a high level philosophical concepts of socialism to like the dreams of utopia.

1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:14.800
 So what, first of all, what is socialism?

1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:16.000
 That's another loaded term.

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.240
 It is a socialism, particularly in America is a very loaded term, and what Americans

1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:27.080
 call socialist is a large amount of provision of services by the state, which is commonplace

1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:28.240
 in Europe.

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:34.360
 It's still moderately commonplace in my own home country of Australia.

1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:38.680
 And that Americans will call public education socialist.

1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:42.320
 That's a total parody of the word.

1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:46.920
 Strictly speaking, what socialism meant is the public ownership of the means of production.

1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:49.880
 No private ownership for the means of production.

1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:51.440
 What is the means of production?

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:53.440
 Machine factories.

1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:59.920
 So all the goods that are produced in factories, no, the means of producing the goods is owned

1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:01.800
 by a centralized entity.

1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:02.800
 Yeah.

1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:03.800
 Centrally planned.

1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:09.440
 What actually was done under Gold's plan under the Soviets and even with a collective farms

1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:10.440
 as well.

1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:11.520
 You no longer owned your land.

1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:13.400
 The state owned the land.

1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:15.200
 You worked on the land.

1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:16.840
 And this was supposed to be utopia.

1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:17.840
 Right.

1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:19.360
 Now it did turn out to be one.

1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:23.440
 And we'll talk about maybe your ideas of why it didn't turn out to be one.

1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:25.840
 So the fascists did the same.

1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:28.160
 So is this fascism also?

1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:31.080
 Fascism, so called national socialism.

1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:32.680
 It's also a kind of socialism.

1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:36.800
 Yeah, but there was no public direction.

1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:40.720
 So the state would tell factories what to do with a still private profit.

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:44.880
 And a large part of why the Nazis succeeded was the extent to which they managed to coopt

1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:47.640
 major manufacturers in Germany.

1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:51.840
 So it's direction versus ownership.

1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:55.800
 It's a dictatorial, I mean, that's a very particular implementation.

1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:56.800
 Yeah.

1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:01.080
 So you have to consider the full details of the implementation, but it's basically dictator

1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:02.080
 guided.

1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:03.080
 Yeah.

1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:09.000
 And if you want to take a proper vision, then you have to say it's the ownership of the

1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:14.080
 means of production by the state versus the ownership by private.

1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:18.600
 That rules out the Nazi period to use the word that again, they're bastardizing as much

1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:23.600
 as Americans do in the opposite direction.

1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:27.080
 Well, what does ownership exactly mean?

1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:31.080
 Well, it became incredibly complicated.

1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:36.680
 And this is actually the best work on this is done by recently deceased Hungarian economist

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:38.680
 called Janos Kornay.

1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:43.360
 And Kornay tried to explain why socialism failed because...

1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:45.360
 Why did socialism fail in your view?

1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:47.360
 In his view, in Janos's view, in your view?

1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:49.080
 I think Janos is 100% correct.

1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:50.920
 And it's a brilliant piece of work.

1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:53.880
 So I'm going to be really paraphrasing his view.

1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:58.960
 And he imagined an ideal socialist society, and there wasn't a Stalin.

1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:00.480
 There weren't purges.

1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:04.480
 And you lived up to all the ideals that Marx had for socialism.

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:10.800
 So he said, but you do it in a context of a economy which is incredibly primitive, Russia.

1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:13.480
 Because if you look at Marx's own vision of the revolution, it was going to happen in

1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:15.480
 England.

1:14:15.480 --> 1:14:18.920
 The advanced economies would be first to go through the revolution.

1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:23.440
 The socialist, the primitive economies would have to go through a capitalist transition.

1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:26.760
 And this is the difference when the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.

1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:30.320
 So the Mensheviks and Hymen Minsky came out of the Menshevik family.

1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:33.360
 The Mensheviks believed you had to go through a capitalist phase.

1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:36.600
 Russia had to go through a capitalist period before it become socialist.

1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:42.360
 The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go, bypass the capitalist phase, do

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:47.240
 the development under socialism rather than under capitalism.

1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:50.040
 And this is what Janos was actually analysing.

1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:57.120
 He started from a primitive feudal economy, very little industrialisation, and you want

1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:04.520
 to jump to an advanced industrial society from that foundation.

1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:10.040
 So he said, what you have then for is a whole range of industries, all of which need as

1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:12.840
 much resources as you can get for them.

1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:19.640
 So you want to develop agriculture, mining, industry, every little division of it.

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:24.280
 They all have legitimate demands on the resources of the country and the state.

1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:29.280
 That means that all your resources are fully employed and are properly over employed.

1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:33.000
 So you have a resource constraint in that society.

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.720
 The easiest way to cope with a resource constraint is to produce last year's commodity, not to

1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:40.800
 innovate, not to make change.

1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:46.120
 So what they will give you is as you start to invest, so you now have the beginnings

1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:51.120
 of a steel industry, beginnings of a car industry and so on, you start investing, but you continue

1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:54.560
 producing the same product you made last year.

1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:58.560
 And I have a perfect, personal example of that, which I'll throw in now if you like,

1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:00.560
 a pretty heavy conversation.

1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:07.960
 My first major girlfriend had a brother who wanted to get a motorbike, but he couldn't

1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:11.280
 afford a Honda or a Kawasaki.

1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:17.000
 At the time, they cost about $3,000 for a 650cc Japanese motorbike.

1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:23.440
 And he found he could buy a Cossack for $650, $1 per cc.

1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:24.440
 So I was there when...

1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:25.440
 I got a Cossack.

1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:26.440
 I like it.

1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:30.320
 This is in suburban Sylvania waters in Sydney.

1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:35.280
 So this crate arrives with a Cossack motorbike inside it.

1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:38.840
 So we take it apart, it's then got all these wooden palings, we have to pull off the wooden

1:16:38.840 --> 1:16:40.400
 palings to open it up.

1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:44.760
 Then there's oil sakes rag over this thing, which is tied on a wooden base.

1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:50.400
 We take the oil sakes rag off and we stare in all its glory in a 1942 BMW.

1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:55.200
 It was exactly the same as Steve McQueen and Great Escape.

1:16:55.200 --> 1:16:59.320
 So the Russians for 30 years were making the same bloody motorbike.

1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:02.440
 It had a bicycle seat.

1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:03.960
 And that's how they coped.

1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:06.280
 They just made the same damn machine every year.

1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:09.240
 And he said, so that's the outcome.

1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:11.200
 You actually want the best possible world.

1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:13.400
 You're trying to build as fast as possible.

1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:16.480
 You're paying workers as high wages as you possibly can.

1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:19.080
 And that leads to a world where you don't innovate.

1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:24.560
 But he said, capitalism on the other hand, pure capitalist economy, you're trying to

1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:26.920
 pay workers as little as possible.

1:17:26.920 --> 1:17:28.560
 You have competitive industries.

1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:31.280
 You're trying to take demand away from your rivals.

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:37.360
 You have Kawasaki versus Honda versus BMW, et cetera, et cetera.

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:41.800
 The way you get demand away from your competitors is by innovating.

1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:45.920
 So what you will get is cycles and burns and slumps, but you'll innovate and change over

1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:46.920
 time.

1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:52.680
 So what you find was this huge gap between socialist volume production with no innovation

1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:55.880
 and capitalism with innovation.

1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:59.880
 So that was the fundamental failing that John Oskarne saw.

1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:02.280
 So why did socialism not innovate?

1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:08.760
 Because if you go back to this famous historical incident with Christiaw in the United Nations,

1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:12.440
 things take off his shoe and bangs the desk, says, we will bury you.

1:18:12.440 --> 1:18:15.200
 He literally meant we're going to bury you in commodities.

1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:17.560
 We're going to produce more output than you are.

1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:19.920
 And he was wrong.

1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:25.400
 Because fundamentally in the long term, to bury somebody in commodity production, you

1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:26.400
 have to innovate.

1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:27.400
 Yeah.

1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:33.720
 And there's also, there's another remarkable Soviet engineer who was given the job of interpreting

1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:36.560
 Marx's ideas of industrial sectors.

1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:42.640
 So he had the commodity sphere, the industry sphere, sector one, sector two, sector three,

1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:46.040
 sector one producing consumer goods, sector two producing capital goods, sector three

1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:49.000
 producing luxury goods for capitalists.

1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.160
 And so he had a three sector model of the economy and he was talking about the dynamics

1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:54.600
 between them.

1:18:54.600 --> 1:18:58.960
 And what Feldman did was reinterpret this as an engineer would reinterpret it, which

1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:00.920
 was brilliant work.

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:05.520
 So what he said was, you need to produce the means of production.

1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:09.480
 If you want to grow quickly, you focus on producing the means of production rather than

1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:10.480
 commodities.

1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:13.120
 So you don't make cars, you make car factories.

1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:14.120
 Okay.

1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:17.480
 You make a few cars, but most of the effort goes into expanding how many factories you

1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:18.480
 have.

1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:21.720
 And what he did was do a mathematical model where you'd start off with very low levels

1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:25.080
 of consumer good output, but then you would just go exponential.

1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:26.080
 Okay.

1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:30.920
 Now I took a look at that back when I was doing my master's degree and the training in mathematics

1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:36.840
 I took Feldman's equations and then looked at what was actually driving it was.

1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:40.840
 He was imagining correctly a huge pool of unemployed labor.

1:19:40.840 --> 1:19:46.280
 If you go back to the earliest stages of Soviet industrialization back in 1917 post the Second

1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:50.520
 World, post the First World War, you had all these unemployed workers, you had all these

1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:53.520
 peasants you could take off the land and put into factories.

1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:57.200
 So you had a huge supply of workers.

1:19:57.200 --> 1:19:58.800
 What you had to do was build the factories.

1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:06.280
 See, building the factories, but at a certain point you exhaust the supply of lowly employed

1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:07.920
 or unemployed labor.

1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:12.920
 And so rather than having this exponential takeoff, you hit a ceiling and then you can

1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:16.800
 only grow as fast as the population because you're not innovating.

1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:20.320
 So that's what actually hit the Soviet system.

1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:23.880
 And it's why they never buried the Western consumer goods.

1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:28.860
 And instead why Eastern consumers looked in envy at the goods being purchased by their

1:20:28.860 --> 1:20:33.920
 Western people and said, if that's exploitation, we want exploitation.

1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:40.640
 So okay, there's a lot of interesting stuff to ask here, which is, so Marx's vision for

1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:48.000
 the socialist utopia is you have to go through capitalism.

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.560
 And then Shavik's were true to Marx's original idea.

1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:57.560
 So is there a case to be made that in the long arc of human history on like human civilization

1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:05.480
 on earth that we're going to live out Marx's vision for utopia, which is like, will we

1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:07.320
 run into a wall with capitalism?

1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:09.000
 I think we are running into a wall with capitalism.

1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:11.800
 In fact, I think we've already gone through the wall and we haven't yet realized we've

1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:16.240
 smashed our skulls.

1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:22.320
 But on the other side, we're bleeding and everything like that.

1:21:22.320 --> 1:21:26.480
 Does Marx have any insights on what the other side of what is beyond capitalism?

1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:32.120
 I think that beautiful phrase from each according to his ability to each according to his needs

1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:36.120
 describes what we should end up with.

1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:40.720
 And I think that's actually, if I think about, you know, I'm an Elon Musk fan, that's what

1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:45.600
 I think is partially going to be the nature of society if we build one that functions

1:21:45.600 --> 1:21:47.200
 on Mars.

1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:52.400
 Because then I've actually seen an interview with the Italian who's involved in designing

1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:54.720
 what the future colony will look like.

1:21:54.720 --> 1:22:00.280
 He was actually asked this question, can there be enormous inequality in Martian civilization?

1:22:00.280 --> 1:22:02.400
 The guy said, absolutely not.

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:06.040
 Because the resources we get in resource constraint applies.

1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:11.520
 You simply can't give somebody an underground bunker 100 times the size of somebody else's

1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:15.840
 100 underground bunker.

1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:22.240
 The scarcity of resources imposes a need for equality overall.

1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:23.840
 Is that always, that's interesting.

1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:28.160
 I mean, the scarcity of resources, wait, but I feel like that's the contradiction.

1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:29.160
 I thought...

1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:31.760
 Are you thinking, you know, classical about scarcity?

1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:32.760
 Yeah.

1:22:32.760 --> 1:22:36.200
 I'm barely thinking at all.

1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:44.120
 So, wait, I thought scarcity, the best way to build on top of scarcity is a capitalist

1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:45.120
 type of machine.

1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:50.400
 No, this is where, again, our vision of what scarcity is, is wrong.

1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:54.480
 Because then Ricardo said this, but it's actually better than Marx.

1:22:54.480 --> 1:23:00.240
 Because Ricardo said, there are some products whose value is determined entirely by their

1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:01.240
 scarcity.

1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:02.240
 Yeah.

1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:07.320
 Like paintings, rare wines, et cetera, et cetera, he said, they are things you cannot

1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:08.680
 reproduce in a factory.

1:23:08.680 --> 1:23:12.720
 He said, the essence of capitalism is what you can make in a factory.

1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:19.920
 And therefore, for these unique objects, these rare objects, Picasso painting, a beautiful

1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:25.840
 bottle of wine, et cetera, et cetera, then the utility, it can't be reproduced easily.

1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:28.480
 So its price will be determined by subjective valuation.

1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:33.160
 He said, what we're talking about in capitalism is the stuff you can make en masse.

1:23:33.160 --> 1:23:37.680
 And that is the true focus of a capitalist economy.

1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:40.960
 And that is not about scarcity.

1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:44.840
 The only scarcity applies when you don't have the resources to make them anymore or you

1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:49.080
 can't use the energy involved because you'll damage the biosphere too much, which we've

1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:50.800
 already done.

1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:56.040
 But fundamentally, the scarcity that neoclassicals have made us think about and Austrians think

1:23:56.040 --> 1:23:59.040
 about as well is non reproducible.

1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:03.400
 But the essence of capitalism is the commodity, the backscratcher, the two buck backscratcher.

1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:06.920
 Anybody can, you know, the cheapest chips to make, and that's why they can make a profit

1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:09.040
 out of them.

1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:13.460
 Not the elaborate gold thing with diamonds and rubies that only the king gets.

1:24:13.460 --> 1:24:19.040
 So we think our vision of scarcity has been perverted by neoclassicals, analyzing the

1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:22.520
 exception to capitalism and calling it capitalism.

1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:23.520
 Okay.

1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:24.520
 Fair enough.

1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:29.720
 So, you know, let's put Mars aside because I think there's a lot of strange factors that

1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:38.120
 have to do with the whole other planet, civilization, that we don't quite understand, like how economics

1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:47.280
 works with different geographic locations, one of which have new challenges, which is

1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:48.280
 what essentially this is.

1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:50.720
 I don't know if you can apply the same economic theory.

1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:55.480
 Well, I'm saying your question, I think we'll be forced into that, ultimately, by having

1:24:55.480 --> 1:24:58.400
 to make a compromise with the ecology.

1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:02.080
 And we've been ruthless about the ecology of this planet, and we're going to pay the

1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:03.680
 price for it.

1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:11.520
 So if you have a planet where you can't be ruthless, okay, you have to mind it as carefully

1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:18.320
 as possible, then those that utopian might be imposed upon you for the needs of a survival

1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:25.520
 on that planet, back here, Marx's utopia was still the one that ignored the ecology.

1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:31.760
 And I think if I have a vision of a utopia in future, it's got bugger all to do about

1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:34.120
 what humans get out of it.

1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:36.280
 It's what humans respect.

1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:38.040
 They have to respect life.

1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:44.480
 So I don't see that as a one eyed utopia, a utopia for a single species, as if it can

1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:47.800
 exist on its own, which we should know it can't.

1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:48.800
 The bathroom break?

1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:49.800
 Yeah, the bathroom break.

1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:51.320
 That would be great.

1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:54.520
 We took a little bit of a break and now we're back.

1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:58.600
 We needed to take a break as my brain broke and I'm piecing it back together.

1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:02.240
 You mentioned ecology and life and the value of all of that.

1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:05.080
 We'll return to it if we can.

1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:17.000
 But first, we said why this idea of why socialism failed, can we linger on this a little bit

1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:28.880
 longer in how did the ideas of Karl Marx lead to Stalinism, to this particular implementation?

1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:35.120
 Is there something fundamental to these ideas that leads to a dictator and that leads to

1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:36.120
 atrocities?

1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:43.520
 There's something about the mechanism of the bureaucracy that's built that leads to a

1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:52.480
 human being that's able to attain, integrate absolute power and then start abusing that

1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:54.720
 power, all that kind of stuff.

1:26:54.720 --> 1:27:00.560
 Some of the history of the 20th century, is that inextricably connected to the ideas

1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:01.560
 of Karl Marx?

1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:05.240
 I think of some extent it is, but I'm going to also say that if it hadn't been for the

1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:10.480
 Bolsheviks interpreting Marx and saying we can reach socialism without going through

1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:14.560
 socialism, then it might not have happened.

1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:22.040
 So, if you look at it like the Mensheviks were a rival political group in Russia and

1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:24.600
 that's where Heimann Minsky, who's a huge inspiration for me.

1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:29.040
 If he's an economist, who was maybe, can we take it a little tangent, who was Heimann

1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:30.040
 Minsky?

1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:36.440
 Yeah, Heimann Minsky was the person who developed analysis of capitalism based on financial

1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:38.560
 instability.

1:27:38.560 --> 1:27:45.800
 He was actually the PhD student of Joseph Schumpeter and an Austrian economist as well,

1:27:45.800 --> 1:27:51.320
 his name I've forgotten temporarily.

1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:58.520
 His parents were both refugees from Russia during the Stalinist period because the Mensheviks

1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:05.320
 were being wiped out in Russia, just like any other opponents to the Bolsheviks were

1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:07.440
 being eliminated.

1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:12.760
 I think his parents met in Chicago, still remain socialist, still remain politically

1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:20.760
 active and he was educated in a family that was just imbued with Marx as its vision.

1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:27.880
 He ended up fighting in the Second World War on the American side, coming back to America

1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:34.640
 and studying mathematics and then also doing an economics degree leading to a PhD.

1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:39.400
 And the question he posed for himself is, what causes great depressions?

1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:44.840
 And he put it beautifully, he said, can it happen again, it being the Great Depression?

1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:50.520
 And if it can't happen, then what has changed between the society before the First Second

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:54.200
 World War and after that makes a depression impossible?

1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:56.400
 What's the answer to those two questions?

1:28:56.400 --> 1:28:57.400
 Can it happen again?

1:28:57.400 --> 1:29:02.480
 His answer was yes, it can happen again, but what has prevented it happening by the time

1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:10.000
 he started writing about it, which was the late 50s to the mid 80s, late 80s.

1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:12.160
 We met once, but only once.

1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:13.480
 Over a beer?

1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:14.480
 Over a beer?

1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:18.480
 No, he gave a seminar at New South Uni and he bit of an obstreperous bastard.

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:19.480
 What?

1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:20.480
 A stripper?

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:21.480
 Obstreperous.

1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:22.480
 Wow.

1:29:22.480 --> 1:29:23.480
 What is it?

1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:26.520
 It means argumentative and likely to dismiss you.

1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:29.880
 So like a good mate of mine was the guy who brought him out to Australia, a guy called

1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:30.880
 Graham White.

1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:32.880
 Good day, Graham.

1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:33.880
 We're still good mates.

1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:34.880
 Good day, Graham.

1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:35.880
 I love your language and your accent.

1:29:35.880 --> 1:29:36.880
 It's a great...

1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:40.520
 Actually, there's a really good TikTok I saw earlier today with an Aboriginal guy saying

1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:43.400
 he loves the Australian language because it's absolutely ironic.

1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:47.560
 You ask an Australian a question and he'll give you an answer, which is the opposite

1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:48.560
 of what he means.

1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:49.880
 And you've got to work out the rest for yourself.

1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:50.880
 Yeah.

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:53.640
 He goes up to another Aboriginal mate and says, good day mate.

1:29:53.640 --> 1:29:54.640
 He says, how are you doing?

1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:55.640
 Oh, not bad.

1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:56.640
 What have you been doing recently?

1:29:56.640 --> 1:29:57.640
 Oh, not much.

1:29:57.640 --> 1:30:01.000
 When are we going?

1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:02.000
 Not too far?

1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:03.000
 Not too soon?

1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:04.000
 Yeah.

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:05.000
 Whereas not too far away?

1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:06.000
 Yeah.

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:07.000
 All negatives.

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:08.000
 And he's a beautiful, beautiful rendition.

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:09.000
 Yeah.

1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:10.000
 Yeah.

1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:11.000
 That's the cool thing about the internet culture.

1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:13.360
 They appreciate that ironic side.

1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:17.760
 Like for example, the best compliment you can give as an Aboriginal to somebody else is

1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:18.760
 that's deadly.

1:30:18.760 --> 1:30:19.760
 That's deadly.

1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:20.760
 That's a compliment.

1:30:20.760 --> 1:30:21.760
 That's deadly.

1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:22.760
 Okay?

1:30:22.760 --> 1:30:23.760
 Yeah.

1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:24.760
 Another mate of mine comes to the Australian language.

1:30:24.760 --> 1:30:26.360
 If I call you a bastard, that's a compliment.

1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:27.360
 Yeah.

1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:30.960
 I mean, tonight the word, bastard.

1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:31.960
 Bastard.

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:32.960
 Bastard.

1:30:32.960 --> 1:30:33.960
 That's deadly.

1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:34.960
 Yeah.

1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:35.960
 I love that.

1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:40.480
 And there's something, unfortunately, there's something about the British accent that makes

1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:46.600
 people sound maybe brilliant, maybe sophisticated.

1:30:46.600 --> 1:30:48.920
 But actually pompous?

1:30:48.920 --> 1:30:49.920
 Yeah.

1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:55.160
 No, that's unfortunately the downside of that, because you can sound pompous.

1:30:55.160 --> 1:31:03.200
 There's something about the Australian accent that you just can't sound brilliant.

1:31:03.200 --> 1:31:04.400
 It humbles you.

1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:06.720
 You sound like you're having a lot of fun.

1:31:06.720 --> 1:31:07.720
 There's wit.

1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:08.720
 There's all that stuff.

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:09.720
 Yeah.

1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:10.720
 Yeah.

1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:13.720
 But you just can't be like, Karl Marx and Australian accent would just not come off.

1:31:13.720 --> 1:31:14.720
 That is a very good point.

1:31:14.720 --> 1:31:16.400
 You would not be able to pull off the beard.

1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:17.400
 That's right.

1:31:17.400 --> 1:31:18.400
 Yeah.

1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:24.960
 I mean, I just, yeah, it's fascinating that the accent determines, you know, something

1:31:24.960 --> 1:31:25.960
 about the person.

1:31:25.960 --> 1:31:29.400
 Maybe it's the chicken and the egg too, it drives the way of the discourse.

1:31:29.400 --> 1:31:33.040
 Obviously, there's a lot of brilliance in your work, but it sounds like you're always

1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:34.040
 having fun.

1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:35.040
 Yeah.

1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:38.560
 And look, this poncho has got a lot of Australian mates here.

1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:42.400
 He spent, what about, how long in Australia?

1:31:42.400 --> 1:31:43.400
 Year and a half.

1:31:43.400 --> 1:31:46.040
 And he's got all these mates who replace Aussie rules football in Austin.

1:31:46.040 --> 1:31:47.200
 You should join them one day.

1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:48.200
 I will.

1:31:48.200 --> 1:31:49.200
 It's actually rough.

1:31:49.200 --> 1:31:50.520
 It's a very creative sport.

1:31:50.520 --> 1:31:51.520
 It's much more fun.

1:31:51.520 --> 1:31:52.520
 It's different than rugby?

1:31:52.520 --> 1:31:53.520
 Oh, very.

1:31:53.520 --> 1:31:54.520
 Rugby is hopeless.

1:31:54.520 --> 1:31:58.640
 Rugby is two morons smashing their bodies against each other.

1:31:58.640 --> 1:31:59.640
 Easy now.

1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:00.640
 Easy now.

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:01.640
 Sorry.

1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:02.640
 Sorry.

1:32:02.640 --> 1:32:04.520
 Not me to offend the rugby fans in the audience.

1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:05.520
 Well, okay.

1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:07.520
 So it's too simplistic.

1:32:07.520 --> 1:32:08.520
 It's too simplistic.

1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:10.240
 It's, I mean, there's skill in it.

1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:16.040
 I've seen some really skillful rugby union and rugby league plays in my day, but fundamentally,

1:32:16.040 --> 1:32:18.440
 if you hit somebody hard enough, they go down.

1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:19.440
 Yeah.

1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:20.440
 Okay.

1:32:20.440 --> 1:32:23.240
 Whereas in Aussie rules, it's about catching the ball and then kicking the ball.

1:32:23.240 --> 1:32:24.240
 More skill.

1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:25.240
 More skill.

1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:31.520
 And the bodies of the athletes, I can actually get off and measure what a sport is like by

1:32:31.520 --> 1:32:38.320
 the bodies it creates, and you get these incredibly elegant, lithe muscular forms out of Aussie

1:32:38.320 --> 1:32:39.320
 rules.

1:32:39.320 --> 1:32:42.920
 Such beautiful words you have in your vocabulary, a lithe, I don't even know.

1:32:42.920 --> 1:32:47.720
 But I'll assume you know what it means and maybe somebody in the audience.

1:32:47.720 --> 1:32:48.720
 Okay.

1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:49.720
 So, all right.

1:32:49.720 --> 1:32:50.720
 Fine.

1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:58.280
 We should also mention that you've, in your youth, you know, like last year, I had Olympic

1:32:58.280 --> 1:33:01.520
 weightlifting as part of your life, so you're...

1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:02.520
 Long time ago.

1:33:02.520 --> 1:33:06.120
 And like you said, tennis, I also played tennis for many, many, many, many years.

1:33:06.120 --> 1:33:07.120
 Okay.

1:33:07.120 --> 1:33:08.120
 Yeah.

1:33:08.120 --> 1:33:09.120
 It's a fascinating game.

1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:10.120
 It's a wonderful game.

1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:11.120
 Yeah.

1:33:11.120 --> 1:33:15.600
 That's my favorite game.

1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:17.600
 Karl Marx and Stalin.

1:33:17.600 --> 1:33:18.600
 Yeah.

1:33:18.600 --> 1:33:22.840
 So, how do we get onto Aussie football in Australia and in the accent?

1:33:22.840 --> 1:33:23.840
 I'm not really sure.

1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:28.600
 You talked about the way I said something about Karl Marx and with Karl Marx, anyway,

1:33:28.600 --> 1:33:29.600
 we got there.

1:33:29.600 --> 1:33:31.520
 Yeah, we got there and now we return.

1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:32.840
 But back to Marx, I think...

1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:33.840
 It's not the destination.

1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:34.840
 It's the journey.

1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:40.280
 I think Marx, the failure of socialism with Janos Korn, I captured beautifully.

1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:44.800
 This idea already called demand constrained versus resource constrained economies.

1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:48.520
 And capitalism is demand constrained, okay?

1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:52.600
 And this is, again, where neoclassical theory is completely wrong, empirically completely

1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:53.600
 wrong.

1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:58.040
 So, the neoclassicals have a vision of capitalism being resource constrained and it's about

1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:02.640
 maximizing your usage of resources subject to constraints.

1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:05.440
 And as Korn, I said, that's really what happened to socialism.

1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:11.480
 What happens under capitalism is that you have 15, 20 companies producing automobiles.

1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:15.680
 They are all trying to capture as much of the market as they can.

1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:20.840
 If you add up their marketing plans, you're going to get 120, 130% of the actual market.

1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:23.080
 So they're all going to have excess capacity.

1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:27.200
 When you build a factory, you're building it with a plan for it to exist for 5, 10, 15

1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:28.200
 years.

1:34:28.200 --> 1:34:30.400
 You have to have excess capacity in the factory.

1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:35.560
 So that means that capitalism has far greater productive capacity than it actually uses.

1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:39.640
 And then the way that you manage to get demand into your factory is to innovate and produce

1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:41.760
 something nobody else does.

1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:45.920
 Before you're producing in volume and when somebody produces like a bung tire, comes

1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:50.000
 out of firestone, then good year is ready to expand its production and take advantage

1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:51.000
 of that.

1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:54.360
 So that's the actual nature of competition in capitalism.

1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:59.240
 And that means that we get a cornucopia of goods, even if we're lowly workers.

1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:02.760
 The variety of goods in capitalism is overwhelming.

1:35:02.760 --> 1:35:05.040
 And that just doesn't happen in socialism.

1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:09.040
 You get your 1942 Cossack as your motorbike, that's it.

1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:13.600
 When you put your money down to buy a refrigerator, it'll arrive in 10 years because the factory

1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:15.640
 is already fully constrained.

1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:21.480
 So all these resource constraints mean that people aren't happy under socialism.

1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:26.600
 And if you've got a whole bunch of people that aren't happy, then the best way to control

1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:29.000
 them is to suppress them.

1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:33.120
 So I think in that sense, ultimately, yes, it does lead to something like Stalinism.

1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:36.400
 So it's easier to give happy people freedom.

1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:41.560
 Yeah, I mean, happy people get pretty silly outside, and not to particularly the extent

1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:47.680
 to which Americans overuse and distort the word freedom drives me barmy.

1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:52.760
 All of these words can be distorted, but they all at the core have some fundamental power

1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:53.760
 and beauty.

1:35:53.760 --> 1:35:58.040
 And then we just distort on the surface for the fun of it, just to start battles on Twitter

1:35:58.040 --> 1:35:59.040
 and so on.

1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:02.840
 But what citizens of the Soviet world didn't feel was freedom.

1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:06.400
 Not just in it, first of all, it wasn't freedom to buy commodities.

1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:09.640
 The commodities are supposed to be on the shops weren't there.

1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:11.440
 The volume couldn't be produced.

1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:15.800
 And what you then got out of that as well was the classic Soviet joke, they pretend to

1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:17.560
 pay us and we pretend to work.

1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:18.560
 Okay.

1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:20.040
 Yeah, so you're not motivated.

1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:26.200
 Oh, look, I went to Cuba about eight years ago, invited to give a talk there and are

1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:28.920
 staying in a hotel itself, the hotel's a story.

1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:31.640
 There's one day my meetings were canceled.

1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:35.480
 So I thought I might go down to the beach and they had a, in the hotel, they had a wing

1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:39.000
 which is the tourist office and there were three women working inside the office.

1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:42.720
 So I thought I just got up and asked them, you know, how do I get to the beach?

1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:48.360
 And one of them says to me, I stood there, just stood in the, in the room waiting to

1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:52.960
 see if they'd make eye contact with me, three women, nobody else in the place, none of them

1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:53.960
 looked at me.

1:36:53.960 --> 1:36:57.480
 So I finally went up to one of them and said, I want to go to the beach and do some surfing

1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.680
 where she said, I can get a taxi outside.

1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:03.960
 Now, fundamentally, she was saying, well, I'm being paid shit money here.

1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:06.520
 I'm not going to, I don't want to work.

1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:13.080
 I'm not going to do anything apart from sit here and qualify for my time.

1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:16.600
 And as much as there are reasons the Cubans have suffered from American embargoes and

1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:21.640
 all that sort of stuff, you've still got that fundamental shortage economy that, that

1:37:21.640 --> 1:37:26.400
 Corne spoke about coming out of the, the structure of central ownership and central

1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:28.680
 control of distribution and investment.

1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:34.960
 It makes my heart because I think some of the effects of that persist throughout time.

1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:36.560
 It become part of the culture too.

1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:37.560
 Yeah.

1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:38.560
 Yeah.

1:37:38.560 --> 1:37:39.560
 It's very interesting.

1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:40.560
 Negative culture.

1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:41.560
 Yeah.

1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:42.560
 Yeah.

1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:43.560
 Well, from, from the Western perspective.

1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:46.520
 Well, even from the people living through it, I mean, like, I had enough conversation

1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:51.680
 with Cubans, you know, meeting him on the street, hopping in a cab, you know, there was one

1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:56.160
 guy I was talking to who was a, he was an industrial chemist and you've got a better money being

1:37:56.160 --> 1:38:00.480
 a cab driver because he could make money out of taking foreign tourists from the airport

1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:01.480
 to the city.

1:38:01.480 --> 1:38:06.640
 By the way, this episode is brought to you by delicious Coca Cola.

1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:10.440
 That's why I didn't want to have it on camera, but anyway.

1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:12.440
 No, maybe they'll actually sponsor.

1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:15.960
 You want to make sure you rotate the label to show, this is capitalism.

1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:16.960
 Yeah.

1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:18.400
 What are we talking about here?

1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:19.400
 Even though it's red.

1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:20.400
 Yeah.

1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:22.400
 It's actually anarchist.

1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:27.160
 I should tell you, I don't know if you know who Michael Malus is.

1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:28.160
 Michael.

1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:29.160
 Michael Malus.

1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:30.960
 He's an anarchist and he lives next door.

1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:31.960
 He doesn't.

1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:32.960
 Okay.

1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:33.960
 No, I've lost touch with anarchist philosophy.

1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:40.400
 I actually used to read, read, you know, Kropotkin and Bakunin and so on and I enjoyed

1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:44.640
 their philosophy and then I helped organize an anarchist conference once and that was

1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:48.400
 the biggest antidote possible to being an anarchist.

1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:50.640
 That sounds like an entry point to a joke.

1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:51.640
 Yeah.

1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:52.640
 Yes.

1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:53.640
 An anarchist party.

1:38:53.640 --> 1:38:54.640
 It is.

1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:59.560
 I mean, we literally spent three days arguing over whether there should or should not be

1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:01.640
 a chairperson for conversations.

1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:02.640
 Yeah.

1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:12.880
 Well, that may be that Monty Python's life of Brian was lived out live.

1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:15.160
 Look at the bright side of life.

1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:16.160
 All right.

1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:20.680
 So part of that explains why, for example, even to this day and some of those parts of

1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:25.160
 the world, entrepreneurship does not flourish.

1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:30.680
 There's not a spirit in the people to start businesses, to launch new endeavors and all

1:39:30.680 --> 1:39:33.520
 those kinds of things.

1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:40.560
 We're just taking all kinds of strange little strolls, but how do you explain the mechanisms

1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:48.160
 of China today where there's quite a bit of sort of flourishing of businesses and so on?

1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:51.200
 It's a very peculiar kind of entrepreneurship.

1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:57.160
 They got away from central control, but they still manage central political control, but

1:39:57.160 --> 1:39:59.320
 diversified economic control.

1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:03.080
 So you could, it is possible to draw a line between politics.

1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:06.800
 It is possible and I think in some ways China is more likely to survive as a society going

1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:12.320
 into the future than Western capitalist societies are.

1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:22.400
 So it's like, if we do the Karl Marx, the foreground and the background, you can centralize

1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:31.160
 the politics, the humanity, the subjective stuff and then distribute the objectives.

1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:36.680
 You've got to have the goods and that's when the big change from Mao to Deng Xiaoping was

1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:40.920
 the characterizing that little saying that, I don't care whether you have a black cat

1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:43.960
 or a white cat, so long as it catches mice.

1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:49.320
 And there was a level of pragmatism to the Deng Xiaoping revolution over Mao and Mano

1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:51.320
 Mao in particular.

1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:56.920
 And that was manifest in the desire to get as much of those Western goods as possible.

1:40:56.920 --> 1:41:01.280
 And I was actually in China in 81, took a group of journalists there, some mentioned

1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:06.960
 earlier, for a tour and we ended up going to the Sichuan free trade zone.

1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:14.920
 And that gave us an idea of why China was going to succeed because they had a rule that

1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:17.680
 you couldn't just come in and exploit the cheap wages.

1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:22.200
 You had to also have a Chinese partner and within five years, the Chinese partner had

1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:25.920
 to own 50% of the business, which is huge.

1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:30.920
 And that gives you an idea of the reduction in wages these American corporations are looking

1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:31.920
 at.

1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:35.160
 They'd shut down the factory and there was now the Rust Belt of America that might be

1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:41.400
 paying somebody there that time maybe $2 an hour and they come across to China and they're

1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:43.600
 paying $0.02 an hour.

1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:48.840
 So they were enormous amount of wages that they dropped, they were willing to forego

1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:52.240
 half the profits and the ownership of the firm.

1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:57.400
 So what the Chinese were doing wasn't just exploiting their labor force, it was also

1:41:57.400 --> 1:41:59.680
 building a capitalist class.

1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:04.320
 And that meant that you had this, that's where all the Chinese corporations have come from.

1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:11.160
 So they were building a capitalist system within a socialist command political system

1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:14.480
 and that worked and it's still working.

1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:18.360
 So there was the centralization of the economic stuff, the Gosplan approach.

1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:24.200
 I think that was where the Soviet failed and what the Chinese realized after what they

1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:28.800
 went through under Mao was you have to have that capitalist period, but they weren't going

1:42:28.800 --> 1:42:33.080
 to abandon the communist control politically, the country at the same time.

1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:36.280
 And that worked out brilliantly and there's a huge amount of innovation taking place in

1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:43.760
 China today and they also will do gigantic infrastructure projects, breathtaking planning

1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:44.760
 going into that.

1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:50.560
 If you would have seen videos of building a skyscraper in a day, the planning that has

1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:54.280
 to go into that, the pre preparation that's necessary is enormous.

1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:57.480
 So there's a real respect for engineers as well in that society, which does not apply

1:42:57.480 --> 1:42:58.480
 in the West.

1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:04.760
 What do you think about the, from the Western perspective, the destructive effects of centralized

1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:09.920
 control of the populace of the ideas of the discourse of the censorship and the surveillance,

1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:10.920
 all those things.

1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:16.520
 So it's a bit like we were talking about Russia to some extent beforehand with centralized

1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:21.000
 versus decentralized corruption.

1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:27.200
 And when you had the centralized political stuff means you know you can't criticize

1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:31.720
 within China, but so long as you don't criticize, you can do what you like.

1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:36.320
 And how destructive is that to the human spirit, which is from the American perspective,

1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:42.960
 I found some pretty feels destructive before, I've been to China quite a few times ever

1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:47.240
 in my life, a lot in the last, not for about four years, but for the six years before that

1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:53.680
 a few visits and staying in second and third and fourth tier cities.

1:43:53.680 --> 1:43:59.040
 So populations of only four million people, which is quite small on Chinese standards.

1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:03.680
 And I had a lot of happy people that I was interacting with my girlfriend at the time,

1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:06.360
 her social circle.

1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:09.760
 And like you can feel when people can't discuss a political issue.

1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:12.080
 For example, in Thailand, you can't discuss the king.

1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:16.280
 Okay, they still have, you know, less majestic laws.

1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:19.400
 So you can actually be jailed for discussing the king.

1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:24.280
 And you can feel that to some extent, and it is a political issue in Thailand now.

1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:30.000
 But in China, what I got back from most people, it was a bit like a benevolent big brother.

1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:34.760
 Okay, but then when you get things out like the lockdown, which is applied recently, then

1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:40.920
 you get the failings of the Soviet system is still there in the Chinese system.

1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:47.680
 In that the easiest way to avoid criticism as a underlying carrying out instructions

1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:54.200
 of people above you is to carry those instructions out to the letter beyond what the people actually

1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:56.120
 want you to do at the top.

1:44:56.120 --> 1:45:00.320
 So we had a classic illustration of that when I took these journalists.

1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:06.320
 There was a news report saying that China's output of light industry had grown by 17% in

1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:10.240
 the previous year, but heavy industry had fallen by 7%.

1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:12.560
 We just don't compute.

1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:14.440
 So we kept on asking, why did this happen?

1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:18.360
 Every time we asked a question, this is back in 81, the answer would be the initial answer.

1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:23.360
 We followed the directive to the Central Committee, the Communist Party of China.

1:45:23.360 --> 1:45:26.200
 We finally got a guy to elaborate and say what that was.

1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:30.560
 He said, well, the Central Committee sent out a directive to promote light industry.

1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:32.440
 So what did you do?

1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:37.560
 We stripped heavy industry factories and turned them into light industry.

1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:40.360
 Now that's destructive of everything.

1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:44.680
 And that's the overlay that you've still got sitting over the top of China, but a huge

1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:52.120
 part of the industrialization was simply saying, produce whatever you can make goods, market

1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:53.560
 them, sell them.

1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:59.720
 And you get that innovative component of humanity is respected and the goods turn up and everybody's

1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:00.720
 well fed.

1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:04.560
 Food in America, Russia is far better than food in America.

1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:08.600
 So in terms of material satisfaction and freedom.

1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:11.360
 For example, enjoy dancing.

1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:19.040
 I mean, we went to, I think somewhere in Shanghai and there's this line of people involving

1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:24.400
 a woman who would have been close to her nidies and a kid who was about six or four.

1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:25.400
 Partying it up.

1:46:25.400 --> 1:46:27.960
 Partying it up in the open air and doing this Chinese collective dance.

1:46:27.960 --> 1:46:31.480
 You have to be really careful about that kind of thing.

1:46:31.480 --> 1:46:44.640
 So in terms of measuring the flourishing of a people by looking at their happiness have

1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:48.440
 so many thoughts on this, but I'm imagining North Korea.

1:46:48.440 --> 1:46:55.920
 And if you talk to people in North Korea, I think they would say they're happy.

1:46:55.920 --> 1:46:56.920
 No.

1:46:56.920 --> 1:47:01.000
 Well, let me try to complete this argument.

1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:07.120
 Not an argument, but a sort of challenge to your thought, which especially in the bigger

1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:12.720
 cities because they don't know the alternative.

1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:14.520
 So what else do you need?

1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:16.520
 There's enough food on the table.

1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:21.520
 We have a leader that loves us and we love him.

1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:24.360
 We're full of our hearts are full of love.

1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:33.560
 Our table is full of food, they would say, because it's enough food.

1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:34.560
 What else do you want from life?

1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:38.160
 No, I think, okay, like that's, so let me sort of chat because like, that's, that's

1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:39.160
 an alternative.

1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:43.160
 I mean, I've, when I'm in Romania, so let me sort of complete that.

1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:44.160
 Sorry.

1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:45.160
 Yeah.

1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:50.920
 Because I'm taking the most challenging aspect when there's centralized control of information

1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:55.600
 that you don't know the alternative, that you don't know how green the grass is on the

1:47:55.600 --> 1:47:56.960
 other side.

1:47:56.960 --> 1:48:00.920
 And so your idea of happiness might be very constrained.

1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:04.320
 So, you know, you could also argue that is happiness.

1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:08.560
 If you don't know, like, ignorance is bliss, ignorance is bliss.

1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:13.800
 And then so is happiness really the correct measure for the flourishing?

1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:14.800
 It's not.

1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:20.520
 But I mean, there's actually a classic book and movie as well, we called Mao's Last

1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:21.520
 Dancer.

1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:22.520
 Okay.

1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:28.720
 And that is a young man explaining his progression from being a dancer in the Cultural Revolution

1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:33.720
 through to a leading dancer in American and ultimately Australian ballet.

1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:38.840
 And he explicitly says at one point that he's told that the Chinese people have the

1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:41.120
 highest standard of living in the world.

1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:44.440
 And the reaction of him and his kids, like his, you know, fellow six year olds is, God,

1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:47.440
 it must be miserable elsewhere in the world then.

1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:48.440
 So they knew.

1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:49.440
 They still know.

1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:50.440
 They still know.

1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:52.600
 There's no such thing as that complete ignorance.

1:48:52.600 --> 1:49:01.040
 But what I'm talking about is experiences and trying to say back in about 2016, 2014,

1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:07.240
 there was as a feeling of freedom within limits that you didn't want to transgress because

1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:09.360
 the system was working.

1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:12.720
 So if you like, it's kind of like marriage, it's kind of like marriage.

1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:14.720
 Hey, that's a good example.

1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:15.720
 There's limits.

1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:16.720
 There's limits.

1:49:16.720 --> 1:49:18.000
 You can have fun within those limits.

1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:19.000
 That's right.

1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:24.160
 And people did have fun and they did feel free, but they didn't want to go and get divorced.

1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:30.640
 But that dilemma was accommodated because the boundaries until you started hitting restrictions

1:49:30.640 --> 1:49:33.240
 were wide.

1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:37.000
 And like when you look at it, I mean, look at the, again, with the Chinese Communist

1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:43.240
 Party, the administrators of that are often highly qualified engineers who can then make

1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:47.720
 intelligent decisions about what should be done as infrastructure and so on.

1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:54.400
 And you go to China and you've got an incredible high speed rail, fantastic infrastructure,

1:49:54.400 --> 1:49:59.840
 internet, telecommunications and so on, rapidly evolving solar.

1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:06.200
 There's a range of things there that are so well done that reflect the fact that the selection

1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:11.600
 process that gives you your political elite is partially focused upon sucking up, et cetera,

1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:12.600
 et cetera.

1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:13.600
 It's still there.

1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:19.080
 It's also focused upon your skill levels and you get people making decisions who damn well

1:50:19.080 --> 1:50:20.520
 know what they're talking about.

1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:24.960
 Like Australia's got a classic example, the internet in Australia sucks.

1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:31.760
 The reason it sucks is that the Labor Party, which is our version of the Democrats, was

1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:34.520
 in control during the global financial crisis.

1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:41.680
 And as part of that, they wanted to bring in optical fiber connections to the house.

1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:48.440
 You have an optical fiber backbone and an optical fiber right to your T100 output from

1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:49.760
 your home.

1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:54.480
 And the Liberal Party fought that and said, that's going to be too expensive, take too

1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:55.480
 long to do.

1:50:55.480 --> 1:51:01.240
 We're going to do cable to the node and then have a copper network linking from a node

1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:03.240
 on a street to all the houses in the street.

1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:07.240
 It's going to be cheaper and faster, have it more soon, blah, blah, blah, blah, it was

1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:09.800
 a total technical fuckup.

1:51:09.800 --> 1:51:13.880
 And Australia now has internet that's about 50th or 60th as far as it's in the world.

1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:16.040
 It's dreadful for the internet.

1:51:16.040 --> 1:51:22.880
 Two political figures made that decision, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, rivals and

1:51:22.880 --> 1:51:27.840
 leaders of the Conservative Party we call Liberal over there.

1:51:27.840 --> 1:51:34.560
 Now that was shitty decisions that wouldn't happen in a country like China because you've

1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:36.720
 got actual engineers making the decisions.

1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:42.360
 They say, you can't get decent speed if you link optical fiber to copper.

1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:48.280
 So what you get is, even though you can't make the decisions yourself, a vast majority

1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:52.280
 of the decisions are made intelligently and therefore you expect it.

1:51:52.280 --> 1:52:01.640
 It's interesting, but don't you worry about the corrupting aspects of power that you start?

1:52:01.640 --> 1:52:09.520
 You have engineers making intelligent decisions, but at which point does the fat king start

1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:14.520
 saying, these engineers are annoying, I have good internet, I don't understand, bring me

1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:15.520
 the grapes.

1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:18.600
 Well, you get your collegial effects.

1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:19.600
 That can happen.

1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:22.240
 And like Z from what I've seen has got elements of that.

1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:26.480
 So friends of mine who are Caucasians can get away with it.

1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:31.200
 They have a game that they play at conferences, scoring how often people use Z's name in a

1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:35.760
 presentation and giving extra points for the number of photographs of Z that turn up in

1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:36.760
 the whole thing.

1:52:36.760 --> 1:52:40.200
 So you've got this sort of personality cult coming along as well.

1:52:40.200 --> 1:52:44.320
 But at the same time, the planning for the infrastructure that's being built, the social

1:52:44.320 --> 1:52:50.200
 services, the general freedom that exists is so great.

1:52:50.200 --> 1:52:56.160
 And like any Chinese person alive today, like somebody who's Chinese my age, would have

1:52:56.160 --> 1:53:04.200
 been an adult under the late period of Mao and God Almighty that changed the improvement

1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:07.640
 they've seen in their lives, that's what they think about.

1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:14.440
 But if you just look at the history of the 20th century, your intuition would say that

1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:19.720
 some of the mechanisms we see in China now will get you into trouble in the long term.

1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:25.600
 So it seems to be working really well in many ways in terms of improving the quality of

1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:30.240
 life of the average citizen in China, but you start to get worried about how does this

1:53:30.240 --> 1:53:31.240
 go wrong?

1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:32.240
 Well, yeah.

1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:35.800
 But at the same time, maybe, I mean, often people will say, what's your vision for the

1:53:35.800 --> 1:53:36.800
 future?

1:53:36.800 --> 1:53:41.000
 And what they mean is, what vision for the future do you have that I'm going to like?

1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:42.000
 Right.

1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:43.000
 Okay.

1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.520
 Now, what if you have a vision of the future that you don't like?

1:53:45.520 --> 1:53:46.520
 It's dreadful.

1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:52.000
 But that's the ecological crisis I think we're walking blindfolded into.

1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:58.680
 Well, that's right, that part of the picture we'll have to talk about how fundamental of

1:53:58.680 --> 1:54:02.640
 a problem that is, okay, but what does that have to do with the future of China?

1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:06.680
 What it has to do is that if you wish to impose dramatic controls on the consumption of the

1:54:06.680 --> 1:54:13.600
 rich, which would be necessary to reduce our consumption burden so that we can get closer

1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:19.040
 to the ecological envelope we've destroyed already, then you're going to make more likely

1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:24.320
 successful doing that with a centralized system where people accept centralized political

1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:25.320
 control.

1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:29.160
 Then you were in a country where it's all diversified and you scream freedom between

1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:30.520
 every point in a tennis match.

1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:35.320
 And I've literally seen that when I was in Philadelphia sometime back.

1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:41.920
 So the ideology that accepts a collectivist attitude may be more successful in controlling

1:54:41.920 --> 1:54:44.480
 our reducing human consumption levels.

1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:49.000
 Because when we talk about democracy, I mean, who's voting here?

1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:56.120
 How many horses and elephants and birds get to vote?

1:54:56.120 --> 1:54:57.120
 It's very...

1:54:57.120 --> 1:54:58.120
 What's a bird?

1:54:58.120 --> 1:54:59.120
 Yeah.

1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:01.160
 You don't see them around here.

1:55:01.160 --> 1:55:06.360
 It's a very human centric vision we have of this planet and we're going to pay a price

1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:07.360
 for that.

1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:08.360
 Okay.

1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:14.760
 So you're saying to deal with global catastrophic events, centralized planning might be...

1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:18.760
 I think we'll work better, period.

1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:22.360
 But there's some centralized stuff in the United States, for example.

1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:23.360
 Oh, your military.

1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:24.360
 Yeah, I know.

1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:25.360
 No, no.

1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:26.360
 Okay.

1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:27.360
 All right.

1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:31.040
 Now there's that feisty Australian.

1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:35.560
 So besides the military, that's the ideal of the federal government in the United States

1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:40.640
 is that there is some centralized infrastructure building.

1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:41.640
 There's some big...

1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:42.640
 There's not enough of it.

1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:43.640
 Yeah.

1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:44.640
 But there's some.

1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:45.640
 There's some.

1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:51.120
 When you deal with greater and greater global catastrophic events, like the pandemic that

1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:56.280
 we're just living through, that the government would be able to step up and impose enough

1:55:56.280 --> 1:56:02.920
 centralized planning to allow us to enable and empower the citizenry to deal with these

1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:04.600
 catastrophic events.

1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:09.160
 In the case of the pandemic, a lot of people argue that the, first of all, the world but

1:56:09.160 --> 1:56:15.640
 also in the United States failed to effectively deal with the pandemic.

1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:21.560
 On the medical side, on the social side, on the financial side, the supply chain, everything.

1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:29.320
 In terms of communication, in terms of inspiring the populace with the power of science and

1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:31.800
 all the parents, they failed.

1:56:31.800 --> 1:56:34.640
 But the ideal is that we'd be able to succeed.

1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:38.240
 You would have to have a small, efficient, the ideal, the American ideal.

1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:43.920
 You have a small, efficient government that's able to take on tasks precisely like the pandemic.

1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:46.480
 But the thing is maybe it shouldn't have been as small as it was.

1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:51.200
 I mean, my favorite instance of that actually involves the UK because the whole neoliberal

1:56:51.200 --> 1:56:53.800
 approach is about small, efficient government.

1:56:53.800 --> 1:56:58.560
 Well, small, efficient government works when you face small, efficient challenges.

1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:03.880
 When you face something systemic rather than episodic, then it's going to break down.

1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:08.960
 Like this is, I mean, one of the things I greatly respect is Taleb's idea of anti frangile.

1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:12.920
 You want a society which is anti frangile, not easily broken, whereas neoliberalism has

1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:16.440
 pushed us towards this vision of efficiency, but it's easily snapped.

1:57:16.440 --> 1:57:22.400
 Like in the UK, I've forgotten the government minister involved, but she was, she asked

1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:28.120
 her expert committee, how many, this is before, well before the pandemic, how many masks should

1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:31.080
 we have on hand in case of a pandemic?

1:57:31.080 --> 1:57:34.080
 And the answer from the experts was about a billion.

1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:35.080
 Okay.

1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:37.800
 That's 50 masks, that's 20 masks per person.

1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:38.800
 Okay.

1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:39.880
 Oh, that's too many.

1:57:39.880 --> 1:57:42.320
 Let's just make 50 million masks.

1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:43.600
 That's one mask per person.

1:57:43.600 --> 1:57:45.800
 It was gone in a matter of a day.

1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:46.800
 Okay.

1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:48.800
 And therefore that's why they told us, well, masks don't work.

1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:53.240
 You know, what they meant was we don't have enough masks for our health people, let alone

1:57:53.240 --> 1:57:54.240
 for you and the public.

1:57:54.240 --> 1:57:58.080
 So we're going to bullshit you until those masks don't really work.

1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:00.800
 And then people don't wear masks and then we've got enough masks.

1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:04.920
 We rush up the production job and by the time it comes along, people have got the skepticism

1:58:04.920 --> 1:58:05.920
 about masks.

1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:10.080
 So who does the, can you elaborate who does the blame in that case go on to?

1:58:10.080 --> 1:58:13.680
 The blame comes down to the philosophy that says government should always be small.

1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:18.640
 No, but do you really think that bigger government would be the solution to the mask issue?

1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:19.640
 No.

1:58:19.640 --> 1:58:24.480
 So let me, let me push back sort of as possible that, that that's capitalism solves that problem.

1:58:24.480 --> 1:58:29.800
 Well, not, not if there's no money in really long term planning and capitalism.

1:58:29.800 --> 1:58:30.800
 Okay.

1:58:30.800 --> 1:58:31.800
 There's money.

1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:32.800
 There's money.

1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:38.800
 Well, insurance, isn't it possible to construct, isn't possible for capitalism to construct

1:58:38.800 --> 1:58:42.800
 the system that ensures against catastrophic events?

1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:43.800
 Not when they're systemic.

1:58:43.800 --> 1:58:44.800
 Okay.

1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:47.480
 You can ensure against episodic events.

1:58:47.480 --> 1:58:52.400
 If you occasionally have a really bad storm, but in general, the weather's not so bad that

1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:56.400
 all the infrastructure is being destroyed, then you can share that around on a percentage

1:58:56.400 --> 1:58:57.400
 basis.

1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:02.360
 There's policy and distribution for your events and you don't, the mean doesn't move around

1:59:02.360 --> 1:59:06.840
 too much and the standard deviation doesn't change all that much, then insurance works

1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:07.840
 fine.

1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:11.400
 But if you have an, if that's episodic, if you have systemic stuff where the climate

1:59:11.400 --> 1:59:17.840
 is changing completely and you're going to wipe out your agricultural capabilities, you

1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:20.160
 simply can't do insurance on that front.

1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:23.400
 You can't make a profit out of catastrophe and capitalism.

1:59:23.400 --> 1:59:24.400
 Okay.

1:59:24.400 --> 1:59:29.760
 So that example of climate change, let's talk about it.

1:59:29.760 --> 1:59:30.760
 Okay.

1:59:30.760 --> 1:59:37.360
 So you mentioned that the human brain, the economy, and the biosphere are three of the

1:59:37.360 --> 1:59:41.880
 most complex systems we know, okay.

1:59:41.880 --> 1:59:51.360
 And you also criticize the economics community for looking at the effects of climate change

1:59:51.360 --> 1:59:55.240
 when measured as the effect on the GDP.

1:59:55.240 --> 2:00:01.360
 So you're saying it's a catastrophic thing that the biggest challenge our society, our

2:00:01.360 --> 2:00:03.240
 world is facing.

2:00:03.240 --> 2:00:04.240
 Why?

2:00:04.240 --> 2:00:10.000
 If the economy's disagree with you, the effects on the GDP will be minor.

2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:14.120
 So we'll deal with it when it comes.

2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:16.120
 That's the argument against, that's the devil's advocate.

2:00:16.120 --> 2:00:23.160
 You're saying, no, it is a thing that will change our world forever in ways that we should

2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:25.520
 really, really, really be thinking about.

2:00:25.520 --> 2:00:26.520
 Okay.

2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:27.520
 Okay.

2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:28.520
 Make the case of why this would be really tough.

2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:30.000
 The case is simple.

2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:34.120
 Economists have made up their own numbers to say that it's trivial.

2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:35.120
 And you didn't.

2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:37.600
 I'd, no, I haven't even tried to make the numbers.

2:00:37.600 --> 2:00:39.240
 I'm reading what the scientists write.

2:00:39.240 --> 2:00:40.240
 Okay.

2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:41.240
 Okay.

2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:45.200
 And what the economists have done, and like this is William Nordhaus in particular, Nobel

2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:50.200
 Prize winner, ex president of the American Economic Association, literally assumed that

2:00:50.200 --> 2:00:52.960
 a roof will protect you from climate change.

2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:54.880
 He didn't say it in those words.

2:00:54.880 --> 2:00:59.960
 What he said was 87% of American industry occurs in carefully controlled environments,

2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:02.360
 which will not be subject to climate change.

2:01:02.360 --> 2:01:08.040
 Now the only things that all of manufacturing, all of services, he included mining as well,

2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:13.760
 forgetting about open cut mining, government activities and the finance sector, all they

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:16.120
 have in common is they happen beneath me for roof.

2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:20.640
 So he's basically saying climate affects the weather, climate is weather.

2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:21.640
 Okay.

2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:22.640
 Okay.

2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:25.920
 Now that is not at all what is meant by climate change.

2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:32.120
 It's mean changing the entire pattern of the, of the, of the weather system of the planet.

2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:37.600
 For example, the most extreme form of climate change would be a breakdown in the three circulation

2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:42.640
 cells that exist in each hemisphere, the Hadley cell, the Ferris cell, I think it's called

2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:46.560
 in the polar cells, zero to 30, 30 to 60, 60 to 90.

2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:50.480
 Those are the main bubbles, if you like, in the atmosphere.

2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:56.480
 Now if we get enough increase in the energy in the atmosphere that like just like you

2:01:56.480 --> 2:02:00.560
 turn the temperature up on a stove and you have nice bubbles occurring in a pot of soup

2:02:00.560 --> 2:02:05.000
 and then turn the temperature up and they all break down and you've got bubbles everywhere.

2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:06.560
 That's called the equitable climate.

2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:12.840
 If that happens, then most of the rainfall is going to occur between zero and 20 and 70

2:02:12.840 --> 2:02:17.120
 and 90 and the middle is going to be dry, except for extreme storms.

2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:24.280
 We would, we, we built our societies in a period of extreme stability of the climate.

2:02:24.280 --> 2:02:28.680
 And when you look at the longterm temperature records, it's up and down like a, you know,

2:02:28.680 --> 2:02:34.640
 like a seesaw, like a sawtooth blade between say one degree warmer than now and four degrees

2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:38.520
 or six degrees cooler over the last million years.

2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:43.440
 And when you look at where we evolved, it's just at a turning point on the peak of one

2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:44.440
 of those ups and downs.

2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:48.760
 So those, I've forgotten the name of the cycles, but the cycles caused by changes in the earth's

2:02:48.760 --> 2:02:51.520
 rotation around the sun.

2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:56.600
 And so we, we evolved our civilization just at the top.

2:02:56.600 --> 2:03:02.680
 So coming up from a cold period and then we're going to head down to another cold period.

2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:04.560
 And that's when human civilization came along.

2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:07.000
 It's about a period of about 12,000 years.

2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:11.920
 So across that period, the temperature has changed by not much more than half the degree

2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:12.920
 up and down.

2:03:12.920 --> 2:03:17.080
 Now we're blasting it well and truly out of those confines.

2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:23.560
 And my way of interpreting what, what climate change means is the stability of that climate

2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:30.200
 that enables to build sedentary civilizations and not be a nomadic species is being destroyed.

2:03:30.200 --> 2:03:38.040
 So the, the challenge, and by the way, I'm playing devil's advocate right here.

2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:42.280
 The question is, is there something fundamentally different now about human civilization that

2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:51.480
 we're able to build technology that alleviates some of the destructive effects that we have

2:03:51.480 --> 2:03:52.760
 on the climate?

2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:53.760
 We don't know.

2:03:53.760 --> 2:03:56.320
 And then we're going to find out the hard way.

2:03:56.320 --> 2:03:58.920
 And the uncertainty you think will be very costly.

2:03:58.920 --> 2:03:59.920
 Extremely.

2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:05.120
 So many of the trajectories that we might take will be much more costly than they're

2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:06.120
 profitable.

2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:07.120
 Yeah.

2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:10.440
 And, and like we've seen some of the storms that are happening now in Europe, the ones

2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:15.680
 that washed away a village in Germany some time ago, the, the firestorm that hit Canada

2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:16.680
 of all places.

2:04:16.680 --> 2:04:19.880
 I've forgotten the name of the town that was burnt down, but an enormous temperature

2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:24.920
 is in Canada, again, the storms that are happening back in Australia.

2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:29.360
 These are all manifestations of a complete shift in the weather patterns of the planet.

2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:33.840
 And they can wipe out, like a, you know, a village just disappears, just wiped out by

2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:36.160
 unprecedented rains.

2:04:36.160 --> 2:04:37.880
 And this keeps on happening.

2:04:37.880 --> 2:04:43.480
 We've, we've, we are still living in a sedentary lifestyle when we're a nomadic species.

2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:44.480
 Okay.

2:04:44.480 --> 2:04:49.400
 So to be able to maintain that sedentary lifestyle, we do need to, to engineer the planet.

2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:56.320
 We need to keep it within that range of plus one, plus half a degree Celsius minus half

2:04:56.320 --> 2:05:00.360
 a degree, which is really what it's been like for the last 10, 12,000 years.

2:05:00.360 --> 2:05:03.360
 Instead, we're blasting it right out of that range.

2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:09.120
 And we know some of the past climates that have existed then we can model what they imply

2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:14.320
 for our, our food production systems, for example, not the only example, but obviously

2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:15.320
 crucial.

2:05:15.320 --> 2:05:20.880
 So when you look at what are called global climate models produced by scientists, one

2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:27.400
 of the examples, and it was published by the OECD last year, 2021, in the chapter on what

2:05:27.400 --> 2:05:32.280
 would happen if we lose what's called the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation

2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:33.280
 or AMOC.

2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:35.920
 And people would colloquially know that as the Gulf Stream.

2:05:35.920 --> 2:05:39.680
 And that's what distributes heat around all the oceans of the planet.

2:05:39.680 --> 2:05:43.720
 It's part of a huge chain called the thermohyline circulation.

2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:49.080
 But the part that goes across from the, the equator to the North Atlantic, that's called

2:05:49.080 --> 2:05:52.880
 the AMOC and Gulf Stream colloquial way.

2:05:52.880 --> 2:05:58.040
 If that disappears in the context of a two and a half degree Celsius increase in average

2:05:58.040 --> 2:06:03.800
 global temperature, then the proportion of the earth's surface, which is suitable for

2:06:03.800 --> 2:06:09.280
 producing wheat will fall from 20% to 7%.

2:06:09.280 --> 2:06:11.960
 Proportion for corn, similar sort of fall.

2:06:11.960 --> 2:06:15.720
 The proportion suitable for rice will go from 2% to 3%.

2:06:15.720 --> 2:06:19.040
 Now that means a catastrophic, and that's the word used in the report.

2:06:19.040 --> 2:06:22.080
 Traffic collapse in food production.

2:06:22.080 --> 2:06:24.880
 So that's what we're towing with.

2:06:24.880 --> 2:06:32.480
 And we are one and a half, we're about halfway there to that two degrees, 2.5.

2:06:32.480 --> 2:06:40.200
 And economists on the other hand, and this is Richard Toll, published a paper 2016 claiming

2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:45.920
 using what he calls an integrated assessment model that economists developed that losing

2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:51.080
 the Gulf Stream would increase global GDP by 1.1%.

2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:55.280
 Now that, his model, this is what really pisses me off about these people is the worst work

2:06:55.280 --> 2:07:00.360
 I've read in 50 years of being a critic of neoclassical economics.

2:07:00.360 --> 2:07:06.560
 The GCMs, the one presidious produce, of course include precipitation as well as temperature.

2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:12.400
 The IAMs that the economists produce, and this is stated yet again in a paper in 2021,

2:07:12.400 --> 2:07:15.120
 do not include precipitation.

2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:17.120
 They simply have temperature.

2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:21.880
 So they assume that if temperature improves by moving towards the temperature, which is

2:07:21.880 --> 2:07:26.120
 better for producing aquaculture, then so will precipitation.

2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:27.920
 Now that's completely wrong.

2:07:27.920 --> 2:07:31.960
 They've left out a crucial, imagine trying to model the climate while ignoring the fact

2:07:31.960 --> 2:07:33.960
 that there's rainfall.

2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:35.000
 That's what they've done.

2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:39.200
 So their work is so bad, so dreadfully bad, it should never have been published.

2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:40.200
 So they oversaw it.

2:07:40.200 --> 2:07:41.200
 All right.

2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:42.200
 Okay.

2:07:42.200 --> 2:07:43.200
 I'm not going to go for them.

2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:44.200
 Sorry.

2:07:44.200 --> 2:07:45.920
 I'm just going to give them a percent as they deserve it.

2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:51.080
 So it's an oversimplification, but I also want you to steel man people you disagree

2:07:51.080 --> 2:07:57.400
 with and criticize people you agree with if possible to be intellectually honest here.

2:07:57.400 --> 2:08:07.920
 You do say, to push back on the catastrophic thinking about climate change, that the ecology,

2:08:07.920 --> 2:08:18.280
 the biosphere is a complex system, economics, the economy is a complex system.

2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:22.080
 So how can we make predictions about complex systems?

2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:28.920
 How can we make a hope of having a semi confident predictions about the complex system?

2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:36.280
 So the scientific community is very confident about the complex system that is the biosphere

2:08:36.280 --> 2:08:43.040
 and the crisis that's before us on the horizon.

2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:51.000
 And then the economists are as a community, I don't know what percentage, but too much.

2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:59.560
 That part of the community is very confident looking at the economics complex system in

2:08:59.560 --> 2:09:08.480
 saying that, no, this system we have of labor and money and capital and so on would be able

2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:12.000
 to deal with that crisis and any other crisis.

2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:19.320
 And they kind of construct simplified models that justify their confidence.

2:09:19.320 --> 2:09:21.440
 So how do we know who to believe?

2:09:21.440 --> 2:09:25.760
 For start, if you believe the economists, you need your head red.

2:09:25.760 --> 2:09:26.760
 It's not an argument.

2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:27.760
 No, it's not an argument.

2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:29.880
 It's a summary of an argument.

2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:32.920
 No, that sounds a lot like an opinion and an emotional one.

2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:33.920
 I know.

2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:34.920
 I know.

2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:35.920
 I'm so angry about it.

2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:39.040
 Listen, I'll tell you where I stand.

2:09:39.040 --> 2:09:44.160
 And I've begun looking, studying the climate change much more.

2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:54.000
 I used to be on things I don't understand, have not spent time on, I have so many colleagues

2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:57.560
 that are scientists that I deeply respect.

2:09:57.560 --> 2:10:01.880
 And I trust their opinion.

2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:12.120
 I have seen the lesser angels of my colleagues on the pandemic side, on the COVID side.

2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:20.040
 The confidence, the arrogance that in part blinded, I believe, the jump between basic

2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:25.200
 scientific research to public policy.

2:10:25.200 --> 2:10:32.240
 And then, so I've become a little bit more cautious in my trust on climate change.

2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:36.360
 I'm still in the same place, and I don't mean climate change.

2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:45.920
 And anything scientists say, I become a little bit, wait a minute, how does the basic scientific

2:10:45.920 --> 2:10:51.480
 facts of our reality map to what we should do as a human civilization?

2:10:51.480 --> 2:10:52.880
 There I want to be a little bit careful.

2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:57.480
 So whenever now, I see arrogance and confidence, I become suspicious.

2:10:57.480 --> 2:10:58.480
 Well, I'm the same.

2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:04.360
 And that's why I'm being angry about the economists because there's an incredible arrogance, incredible

2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:10.600
 stupidity at the arrogance, assumptions which you look at it and think, how did anybody

2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:12.120
 let that get published?

2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:13.120
 Sure.

2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:14.120
 Okay.

2:11:14.120 --> 2:11:19.440
 So the economic analysis of the effects of climate change are poor, in many cases.

2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:20.680
 Incredibly poor.

2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:26.280
 And this is like, John Lomborg stars himself as the skeptical environmentalist and criticizes

2:11:26.280 --> 2:11:28.640
 the environmental models.

2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:30.080
 He doesn't take a look.

2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:33.000
 He doesn't criticize the work come out by economists.

2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:35.240
 You look at it, it's so bad.

2:11:35.240 --> 2:11:39.960
 Is it possible to do good economics modeling of the effects of climate change?

2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:42.800
 Yeah, it is possible, very difficult.

2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:45.840
 Or is it like one complex systems tech?

2:11:45.840 --> 2:11:51.800
 In that case, yeah, I mean, to me, what you should be looking at is saying, what are the

2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:57.040
 scientists saying are the consequences, probable consequences, not guaranteed, but probable

2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:03.520
 consequences of increasing the energy level of the atmosphere by the amount we're doing.

2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:08.360
 What can the scientists say in terms of the effects because it's so complicated, the effects

2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:15.640
 of sort of shifting resources, so basically, what are the effects of climate change?

2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:17.040
 How can we really model that?

2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:22.240
 Because it's basically you're looking through the fog of uncertainty, because they're rising

2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:24.280
 sea levels.

2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:26.120
 How can we know what effect that has?

2:12:26.120 --> 2:12:28.520
 Well, yeah, we know there'll be a lot of change.

2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:34.080
 Yeah, I think the sea level one is a poor argument, and I don't focus on it.

2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:38.680
 What I mainly focus upon is the weather patterns.

2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:44.600
 And if you look at, like we got the week belt in America goes through Idaho and countries,

2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:49.840
 places like that, and you've got incredibly deep topsoil, Ukraine is another classic example,

2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:56.160
 the depth that the topsoil in Ukraine is remarkable, and that's the wheat bowl of Europe.

2:12:56.160 --> 2:13:00.040
 And that requires both the right temperature for growing wheat and the right rainfall for

2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:01.040
 growing wheat.

2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:07.400
 Now, when you look at the models that climate scientists are building of that, you have

2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:13.760
 pretty much your ultimate foundation is the Lorenz model of turbulent flow.

2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:19.240
 And of course, that's the first model which we saw chaos theory complexity, that beautiful

2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:26.600
 simple model, three variables, three parameters, an incredible complexity out of the system.

2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:32.560
 And what that meant was you also had an exponential decay in the accuracy of your model over time.

2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:39.640
 So if you have, if you'd accurate to a thousand decimal places, then in a thousand days, you'll

2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:44.600
 have no data whatsoever because each time you're losing an order of magnitude of accuracy.

2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:48.800
 So that's the point about the inability to predict for the very long future.

2:13:48.800 --> 2:13:51.760
 But what you can just say, well, there's a prediction horizon.

2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:57.080
 If we're close enough to the, if our statistical measurement of where we are is close enough

2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:02.800
 to where we actually are, and our forecast horizon is narrow enough to not extrapolate

2:14:02.800 --> 2:14:06.840
 too far, then for this direction forward, we can make a reasonable fist of predicting

2:14:06.840 --> 2:14:08.680
 what the weather is going to be.

2:14:08.680 --> 2:14:13.920
 And that's the foundation of meteorological, the stuff we watch on TV, you know, most of

2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:18.800
 the time, the forecast are going to be correct these days, 40, 50 years ago, most of the

2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:20.800
 time the forecast were wrong.

2:14:20.800 --> 2:14:24.560
 So that's the background foundation to these GCMs.

2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:26.720
 But even they've got to massively simplify the world.

2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:30.960
 So you have this enormous sphere where they might divide it down to a hundred kilometer

2:14:30.960 --> 2:14:40.360
 by a hundred kilometer by 10 kilometer cube of rectangles, whatever, oblongs, that's

2:14:40.360 --> 2:14:45.760
 how they're modeling the transition of weather from one location to another.

2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:50.480
 So they've got a chunky vision of the planet, which they have to, they can't model it now

2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:52.240
 down to the last molecule.

2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:53.240
 So you're losing.

2:14:53.240 --> 2:14:54.240
 Not yet, right?

2:14:54.240 --> 2:14:55.240
 It's getting better and better and better and better.

2:14:55.240 --> 2:14:56.240
 Oh, yeah.

2:14:56.240 --> 2:14:58.400
 I think that's just too much processing power.

2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:00.240
 But you're going to have some confine.

2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:01.240
 You can't go.

2:15:01.240 --> 2:15:04.880
 I mean, if you look at the models to do the weather, they used to be of that a hundred

2:15:04.880 --> 2:15:05.880
 kilometer.

2:15:05.880 --> 2:15:06.880
 I think they're about 10 kilometer grids now.

2:15:06.880 --> 2:15:07.880
 I don't know.

2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:11.360
 But so the processing powers let us get more and more precise that way.

2:15:11.360 --> 2:15:16.400
 I do know that the models now include chemical mixing that occurs above cities.

2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:17.400
 Yeah.

2:15:17.400 --> 2:15:19.080
 They've added that complexity to them over time.

2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:23.040
 So you're looking at the increasingly accurate models of weather patterns, the effect they

2:15:23.040 --> 2:15:25.760
 have on agriculture, on food.

2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:31.880
 And you're saying that there's a lot of possibilities in which that's going to be really destructive

2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:34.280
 to society on the food production side.

2:15:34.280 --> 2:15:38.160
 And if you have that increase in temperature, they're going to change in precipitation.

2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:42.520
 And it could mean that where the rainfall and the sunshine are adequate for growing

2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:45.000
 wheat is an area where there's no topsoil.

2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:49.200
 It's like a huge part of the models that the models, the economists use, which only use

2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:52.320
 temperature, don't include precipitation.

2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:58.320
 They predict that a large amount of the wheat output of the world is going to occur in Siberia

2:15:58.320 --> 2:16:00.200
 in the frozen tundra.

2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:05.280
 What about, so that that's a straightforward criticism of oversimplified models.

2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:09.680
 What about the idea that we innovate our way out of it?

2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:17.560
 So there's totally new, what is that, there's a silly, poor example at this time, perhaps,

2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:22.260
 but lab grown meat, sort of engineered food.

2:16:22.260 --> 2:16:30.680
 So a completely shifting source of food for civilization.

2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:33.800
 So therefore alleviating some of the pressure on agriculture.

2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:38.880
 That comes down to the difference that Elon makes between producing a prototype and mass

2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:41.600
 producing the prototype.

2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:47.160
 You can develop the idea very rapidly to put that into production on the scale that's

2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:49.400
 necessary to replace what we're currently doing.

2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:50.400
 Six years.

2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:51.400
 Yeah.

2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:53.320
 We've got, we might have decades.

2:16:53.320 --> 2:16:56.040
 We certainly haven't got centuries.

2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:01.480
 So in the timeframe we've got, I can't see that engineering going from prototype to

2:17:01.480 --> 2:17:06.800
 production levels to predate, replace what we're currently doing in the stable environment

2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:08.520
 they're currently destroying.

2:17:08.520 --> 2:17:13.400
 What do you think about the sort of the catastrophic predictions that people that have thought

2:17:13.400 --> 2:17:16.760
 have written about climate have made in the past that haven't come to be true?

2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:21.920
 It's mainly unfortunately involving Paul Ehrlich and the population bomb and the predictions

2:17:21.920 --> 2:17:22.920
 Paul was making.

2:17:22.920 --> 2:17:25.440
 A few individuals or the one individual in that case.

2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:26.440
 Yeah.

2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:31.560
 So I'm mostly playing devil's advocate in this conversation and enjoying doing so.

2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:38.360
 I do think I'm in agreement with the majority of the scientific community.

2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:40.680
 But you still see that argument made.

2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:45.160
 I still see the argument made and I also am a little bit worried about the arrogance

2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:47.520
 and the ineffectiveness of the arrogance.

2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:48.520
 This is the problem.

2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:50.000
 It's ineffective.

2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:58.960
 And that's what worries me because it's all been put into this sort of sea level rise,

2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:01.400
 temperature changes.

2:18:01.400 --> 2:18:09.080
 It's not put into the fragility of the system in which we currently live and the earth will

2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:10.080
 survive.

2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:14.560
 And there's a wonderful science fiction book called The Earth Abides about a world in which

2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:15.560
 humans get wiped out.

2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:19.040
 There's only a tiny band left and then the earth reasserts itself.

2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:20.880
 So the earth's going to survive us.

2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:22.480
 Will we survive what we do to the earth?

2:18:22.480 --> 2:18:24.160
 That's the question.

2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:32.600
 And my feeling is that we have underplayed the extent to which the civilizations were

2:18:32.600 --> 2:18:36.360
 built have depended upon a relatively stable climate.

2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:41.200
 And it's then there's that turning point in the global average temperature that we evolved

2:18:41.200 --> 2:18:42.480
 right on the top of it.

2:18:42.480 --> 2:18:47.560
 And if we had done nothing, we could find that heading back down towards another ice age

2:18:47.560 --> 2:18:51.040
 could equally destroy the possibility of sedentary life.

2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:57.120
 For example, if we'd never developed fossil fuel based industries, we'd never built super

2:18:57.120 --> 2:18:58.120
 phosphate.

2:18:58.120 --> 2:19:02.000
 So our population would never have reached one billion people.

2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:07.880
 And we were still living like fairly sophisticated animals, but like 17th century level of load

2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:12.040
 on the planet, then we would have gone down that decline.

2:19:12.040 --> 2:19:17.440
 And the approaching ice age would have started to wipe out our farming areas, the glaciers

2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:21.920
 would have encroached, and we would have been driven out of like an agricultural sedentary

2:19:21.920 --> 2:19:24.000
 civilization by that change.

2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:29.800
 So it's just the fact that we evolved on this stable period in the overall temperature

2:19:29.800 --> 2:19:31.240
 cycle of the planet.

2:19:31.240 --> 2:19:36.360
 And that stability is something which just reflects the turning point in the regular

2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:40.120
 cycle of Malichovich cycle, I think it's called, I've forgotten the actual name, but it's

2:19:40.120 --> 2:19:48.040
 a cycle caused by change in the Earth's orbit around the sun, reflectivity and so on.

2:19:48.040 --> 2:19:53.320
 That cycle, it's just that tiny top bit that we evolved in.

2:19:53.320 --> 2:19:57.840
 So what we should have done, so that's really useful for us, we should stay at that level.

2:19:57.840 --> 2:20:01.400
 Now if we hadn't done it, we'd go back down here and that would be the end of our civilization

2:20:01.400 --> 2:20:02.840
 by an ice age.

2:20:02.840 --> 2:20:08.600
 Instead we're going up here really rapidly and we're causing a change in temperature

2:20:08.600 --> 2:20:14.720
 compared to that long term cycle 100,000 times faster.

2:20:14.720 --> 2:20:25.000
 So yeah, I mean, my biggest worry is even subtle changes in climate might result in geopolitical

2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:28.880
 pressures that then lead to nuclear war.

2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:33.520
 And that's, yeah, I mean, there's an argument that's actually behind to some extent, not

2:20:33.520 --> 2:20:39.320
 the Ukraine war so much, but the Arab Spring, the wars in Syria, which partially has led

2:20:39.320 --> 2:20:41.400
 to what's happening in Ukraine.

2:20:41.400 --> 2:20:45.520
 And our weapons are getting more and more powerful and more and more destructive, more

2:20:45.520 --> 2:20:49.040
 and more nations are having these destructive weapons.

2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:54.520
 And now we're entering cyber space where it's even easier to be destructive.

2:20:54.520 --> 2:20:59.520
 And hyperbaric weapons which didn't exist in the Second World War, so you don't need

2:20:59.520 --> 2:21:03.000
 nuclear weapons to have catastrophic attacks on each other.

2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:12.560
 So yeah, it's incredibly scary that the warlike side of human nature could be extremely enhanced

2:21:12.560 --> 2:21:14.560
 by climate breakdown.

2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:21.760
 So in this world, on a happy note, I don't know how we went from Marxism and Stalinism

2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:28.000
 to ecology, but all those are beautiful, complex systems.

2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:31.600
 What is the best form of government, would you say?

2:21:31.600 --> 2:21:36.520
 We talked about the economics of things.

2:21:36.520 --> 2:21:40.440
 You ran for office, so you care about politics too.

2:21:40.440 --> 2:21:43.640
 How can politics, what political systems can help us here?

2:21:43.640 --> 2:21:50.160
 I think we first of all have to appreciate we're one species on a planet out of millions.

2:21:50.160 --> 2:21:57.040
 And as the intelligent species, we should be enabling a harmonious life for those other

2:21:57.040 --> 2:21:58.040
 species as well.

2:21:58.040 --> 2:22:03.320
 Can we actually linger on that, what is, you mentioned that we need to acknowledge the

2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:08.360
 value of life on Earth.

2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:14.520
 Can we integrate the labor theory of value?

2:22:14.520 --> 2:22:18.320
 Can we integrate into that the value of life?

2:22:18.320 --> 2:22:21.800
 So there's human life and there's life.

2:22:21.800 --> 2:22:28.200
 If you take that structure that I talked about of Marx's use value, exchange value, dialectic,

2:22:28.200 --> 2:22:32.440
 the foreground, background, that only exists, that only works because we're exploiting the

2:22:32.440 --> 2:22:35.000
 free energy we find in the universe.

2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:41.800
 There could be no production system without free energy, which is the first law of thermodynamics

2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:42.800
 that exists.

2:22:42.800 --> 2:22:46.800
 There is free lunch after all, and it's grounded in the energy that's provided to us by the

2:22:46.800 --> 2:22:47.800
 universe.

2:22:47.800 --> 2:22:48.800
 Yeah, that's the free lunch.

2:22:48.800 --> 2:22:49.800
 That's what we're exploiting.

2:22:49.800 --> 2:22:50.800
 It's the only free lunch we get.

2:22:50.800 --> 2:22:54.240
 We're going to have a Ginsburg summary of the laws of thermodynamics, don't you?

2:22:54.240 --> 2:22:55.240
 Alan Ginsburg?

2:22:55.240 --> 2:22:56.240
 What's that?

2:22:56.240 --> 2:23:03.800
 You said the laws of thermodynamics are summarized, A, you can't win, B, you can't break even,

2:23:03.800 --> 2:23:06.800
 C, you can't leave the game.

2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:07.800
 Nice.

2:23:07.800 --> 2:23:08.800
 Yeah.

2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:09.800
 Beautiful summary.

2:23:09.800 --> 2:23:10.800
 Beautiful summary.

2:23:10.800 --> 2:23:14.120
 But the fact that it exists in the first place is the free lunch.

2:23:14.120 --> 2:23:15.920
 So we're exploiting the free lunch.

2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:20.320
 But to be able to do it, we can't put waste back into that system so much that it undermines

2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:21.320
 the free lunch.

2:23:21.320 --> 2:23:23.800
 And that's what we've been doing.

2:23:23.800 --> 2:23:30.000
 And once you respect the fact that we have to, living on the biosphere that the planet

2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:36.800
 we're actually on, we have to enable that biosphere to survive us because if it doesn't

2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:40.200
 survive us, we won't survive it disappearing.

2:23:40.200 --> 2:23:43.520
 And there's not that realization in humanity in general.

2:23:43.520 --> 2:23:49.800
 And when you say the value of life, all the different living organisms on Earth are part

2:23:49.800 --> 2:23:50.800
 of that biosphere.

2:23:50.800 --> 2:23:51.800
 Yeah.

2:23:51.800 --> 2:23:58.680
 So in order to maintain the biosphere, we have to respect, like pragmatically speaking,

2:23:58.680 --> 2:24:02.720
 what that means is actually respecting all of life on Earth, even the mosquitoes?

2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:05.120
 I've got some of, no.

2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:06.120
 Parasites.

2:24:06.120 --> 2:24:10.520
 I mean, we are a parasite.

2:24:10.520 --> 2:24:17.440
 When you look at it, we're the mosquitoes of the large organizations, if you're a fan

2:24:17.440 --> 2:24:18.920
 of the Matrix movies at all.

2:24:18.920 --> 2:24:19.760
 Sure.

2:24:19.760 --> 2:24:20.760
 Absolutely.

2:24:20.760 --> 2:24:21.760
 I look what I'm wearing.

2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:22.760
 Absolutely.

2:24:22.760 --> 2:24:23.760
 I was wondering what the inspiration was.

2:24:23.760 --> 2:24:30.000
 I was thinking, we are living in a simulation and I have a conversation offline to have

2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:31.000
 with you about that.

2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:34.320
 You've been misbehaving and we're going to have to put you back in line.

2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:39.960
 So what's Agent Smith says when he's got Morpheus in his possession, he said, I've been trying

2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:45.000
 to classify your species and have decided you're a virus.

2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:46.240
 Now there's truth to that.

2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:48.880
 We have intruded into everything.

2:24:48.880 --> 2:24:54.960
 We've taken over every element of the biosphere and we think we can continue doing that.

2:24:54.960 --> 2:24:59.600
 The thing is, we're exploiting it so much, we're breaking it down.

2:24:59.600 --> 2:25:03.400
 I think it's E.O. Wilson, who argued with the 50% rule.

2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:10.320
 He believed that we should reserve 50% of the planet for nonhuman species.

2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:13.400
 In other words, we make 50% of it off limits.

2:25:13.400 --> 2:25:17.680
 Humans cannot go there and we just let that evolve as it does.

2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:22.480
 When we control the other 50%, I think it's probably giving us too much to us.

2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:27.920
 I think we should actually save like 20%, 25% max and the rest of the planet.

2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:34.480
 We let life go on and evolve as it does without our interference, without our dominance.

2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:40.240
 Now that's neither a democratic democratic system nor an authoritarian one.

2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:44.120
 It's one which starts off with saying the first thing humans have to do is respect life

2:25:44.120 --> 2:25:46.160
 itself.

2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:50.000
 So would we do that?

2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.080
 We haven't done it, obviously.

2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:56.040
 I don't think the Soviets would have done it if we had a generally Soviet system.

2:25:56.040 --> 2:25:58.320
 We haven't done it under a capitalist.

2:25:58.320 --> 2:25:59.800
 We continue intruding.

2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:05.320
 So I think we have to go through something like a Star Trek, a Star Trek catastrophic

2:26:05.320 --> 2:26:10.080
 200 years to realise that ultimately if we're going to survive as a species, we have to

2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:12.040
 respect life in general.

2:26:12.040 --> 2:26:19.200
 And then that means parts of the planet we can no longer touch while we also try to maintain

2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:25.520
 the planet at the temperature that we found it in what we now call the Anthropocene.

2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:34.000
 So politically, we have to have like in many ways what native societies often have, a vision

2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:39.200
 of the cycle of life, not this exponential progression we've developed over the last

2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:46.240
 250 years, and again, I'll use another movie, the Avatar type respect for the cycle of life.

2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:49.560
 We need to have that as part of our innate nature.

2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:55.920
 And then on top of that, the political system comes out and that political system has to

2:26:55.920 --> 2:27:02.960
 be one that lets us feel like we have a say in the direction of society while that part

2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:03.960
 is sacrosanct.

2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:06.040
 We can't touch it.

2:27:06.040 --> 2:27:10.840
 But we also, because we are now living with so many challenges created by our own civilisation,

2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:16.160
 I mean, the main threat to the existence of human civilisation is the existence of human

2:27:16.160 --> 2:27:17.160
 civilisation.

2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:19.600
 It's both a feature and a bug.

2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:20.600
 Yeah.

2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:24.360
 And therefore, we need to have people who can understand complex systems making those

2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:25.360
 decisions.

2:27:25.360 --> 2:27:30.320
 Now, that means it isn't a political system as much as it is an appreciation that the

2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:32.160
 world is a complex system.

2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:36.600
 And therefore, effects, which we think are direct effects, will actually come through

2:27:36.600 --> 2:27:38.400
 in a bleak fashion.

2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:45.000
 And we cannot, there's no simple linear progression from where we are to where we want to be.

2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:47.800
 So you have to see how everything feeds together in a systemic way.

2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:50.640
 And that's why, well, one reason I designed this software I'm wearing the T shirt for

2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:57.200
 now, Minsky, is to have, it's nowhere near to this scale, I hope it one way will be,

2:27:57.200 --> 2:28:00.600
 but something which means we can bring together all that complexity, all those systems and

2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:04.840
 perceive them on an enormous screen where we have all the various interacts and we can

2:28:04.840 --> 2:28:08.880
 see what a potential future is.

2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:10.520
 And that then guides us.

2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:14.920
 So it isn't a case of democracy and, you know, outside winds of vote.

2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:19.600
 And therefore, we ban abortion or we don't, you know, whatever else happens.

2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:26.240
 It's seeing what the, respecting the fact that we're in a complex system and being uncertain

2:28:26.240 --> 2:28:35.800
 about the consequences and not making the bold expansionary ideas that we've been doing.

2:28:35.800 --> 2:28:46.960
 So like being a little bit more and so humble, humble is a good word, but wouldn't you like

2:28:46.960 --> 2:28:58.840
 to apply that same humility both to the considerations of the pros of capitalism and to the catastrophic

2:28:58.840 --> 2:29:00.840
 view of the effects of climate change?

2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:01.840
 Yeah.

2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:05.360
 And also, like I think we can afford to be bold in space.

2:29:05.360 --> 2:29:10.160
 And that's one reason I respect the practical vision of mask and the so far impractical

2:29:10.160 --> 2:29:16.040
 vision of Bezos, that if we're going, if we look for the very far future, the only way

2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:22.680
 we can continue expanding our knowledge of the universe is to move our civilization,

2:29:22.680 --> 2:29:24.600
 the productive side of off the planet.

2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:25.600
 Offsite backup.

2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:26.600
 Yeah.

2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:28.000
 So can you actually linger on this?

2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:29.880
 So let's actually talk about this.

2:29:29.880 --> 2:29:38.680
 So first of all, you have the new book, humbly named the new economics, a manifesto.

2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:40.160
 Publisher chose the title.

2:29:40.160 --> 2:29:41.160
 Yes.

2:29:41.160 --> 2:29:42.160
 No, but I'm joking.

2:29:42.160 --> 2:29:48.440
 So maybe I will ask you about why manifesto, but we'll go through some of the ideas in

2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:51.440
 this book we have been already.

2:29:51.440 --> 2:29:57.960
 So some of it is embracing the fact that the economy, our world, our mind is a complex

2:29:57.960 --> 2:29:58.960
 system.

2:29:58.960 --> 2:30:05.160
 So this t shirt that you're wearing, is the software.

2:30:05.160 --> 2:30:13.280
 I'll do that, do you like it, there you go, you're wearing it, it's just an infomercial.

2:30:13.280 --> 2:30:22.160
 So there's the t shirt that says Minsky, after not my Minsky, it's your Minsky.

2:30:22.160 --> 2:30:23.160
 Not Hyman.

2:30:23.160 --> 2:30:25.480
 So no, they're Hyman Minsky, not Marvin Minsky.

2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:26.680
 Not Marvin Minsky, right.

2:30:26.680 --> 2:30:33.880
 So that's so AI Minsky is Marin and then Harman, it all rhymes.

2:30:33.880 --> 2:30:45.720
 So stability is free open source system dynamics software invented by Mr. Steve Keen, coded

2:30:45.720 --> 2:30:51.120
 by Russell Standish, it's on source forge.

2:30:51.120 --> 2:30:52.120
 It's destabilizing.

2:30:52.120 --> 2:30:53.120
 Stability is destabilizing.

2:30:53.120 --> 2:30:58.120
 So that's sort of embracing the complex aspect of it.

2:30:58.120 --> 2:30:59.120
 Yeah.

2:30:59.120 --> 2:31:01.600
 So how can you model the economy?

2:31:01.600 --> 2:31:09.080
 What is some of the interesting, whether detailed or high level, big picture ideas behind your

2:31:09.080 --> 2:31:10.560
 efforts of Minsky?

2:31:10.560 --> 2:31:16.760
 Okay, Minsky, meaning the software, the modeling software that models the dynamic system that

2:31:16.760 --> 2:31:17.760
 is...

2:31:17.760 --> 2:31:19.960
 Basically what Minsky is doing is system dynamics modeling.

2:31:19.960 --> 2:31:26.520
 So if anybody's used Stellar or Vensim or Simulink, then they've used exactly the same

2:31:26.520 --> 2:31:28.480
 family of software that Minsky is part of.

2:31:28.480 --> 2:31:29.480
 So I didn't invent that.

2:31:29.480 --> 2:31:33.480
 It was invented by Jay Forrester, who's one of the great intellects, one of the great

2:31:33.480 --> 2:31:36.600
 engineers in American history.

2:31:36.600 --> 2:31:41.600
 And the idea of Forrester's system was complex interactions.

2:31:41.600 --> 2:31:46.800
 So he was doing his work in the 50s.

2:31:46.800 --> 2:31:53.200
 People don't know Forrester's work, he actually built the mathematics for the gun turrets on

2:31:53.200 --> 2:31:57.600
 American warships and the Second World War mechanical systems, obviously.

2:31:57.600 --> 2:32:02.080
 So he had to work out how to give a feedback system that meant when the boat rolled in

2:32:02.080 --> 2:32:06.960
 one direction, the turret did not roll the other way, all that stuff was his work.

2:32:06.960 --> 2:32:08.480
 So marvelous engineering.

2:32:08.480 --> 2:32:12.520
 And then he realized, if you want to look at it, even like a factory, a factory is a

2:32:12.520 --> 2:32:13.520
 complex system.

2:32:13.520 --> 2:32:18.880
 And so he had cycles generated out of the interaction between different components of the factory

2:32:18.880 --> 2:32:23.360
 that he was first involved in taming, that he built the software to model complex interactive

2:32:23.360 --> 2:32:24.360
 systems.

2:32:24.360 --> 2:32:25.360
 So Minsky is that.

2:32:25.360 --> 2:32:27.920
 Minsky adds, which is unique, is the Godly table.

2:32:27.920 --> 2:32:31.080
 And that's the double entry bookkeeping, so you can model the financial system.

2:32:31.080 --> 2:32:32.080
 Godly the economist.

2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:33.080
 Godly the economist.

2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:34.080
 Win Godly.

2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:35.720
 Another great, great man.

2:32:35.720 --> 2:32:40.440
 So there's like this, you're modeling it as like a state diagram.

2:32:40.440 --> 2:32:41.440
 Yeah, fundamentally.

2:32:41.440 --> 2:32:43.600
 So it's actually, these are circuit diagrams.

2:32:43.600 --> 2:32:48.800
 It's exactly what engineers have been using for decades, almost a century.

2:32:48.800 --> 2:32:52.260
 So you're using a circuit diagram to model the economy.

2:32:52.260 --> 2:32:58.800
 And that's the, so other factories have done it, what they haven't had in the circuit diagram

2:32:58.800 --> 2:33:02.840
 is a way of handling the dynamics of the financial system.

2:33:02.840 --> 2:33:08.840
 So what the Godly table does is bring it, financial flows has been, everything goes

2:33:08.840 --> 2:33:11.400
 from somewhere and ends up somewhere.

2:33:11.400 --> 2:33:16.840
 So you have a positive and a negative, if you're looking on the liability side, a positive

2:33:16.840 --> 2:33:20.360
 and a positive or negative and a negative, if you're looking in assets and liability

2:33:20.360 --> 2:33:22.880
 side and Minsky gets the accounting right for that.

2:33:22.880 --> 2:33:27.400
 So you can do an enormous complex model, looking at the economy financially from the

2:33:27.400 --> 2:33:31.640
 point of view of a dozen different actors in the economy and know that the mathematics

2:33:31.640 --> 2:33:35.360
 is right, even though what you're building is set of differential equations, which might

2:33:35.360 --> 2:33:40.000
 be 50 differential equations with 350 terms in them.

2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:43.520
 If you've got the Godly tables right, you know the mathematics is correct.

2:33:43.520 --> 2:33:45.640
 So that's the main innovation that Minsky adds.

2:33:45.640 --> 2:33:48.680
 And you're operating there at the macro economics level.

2:33:48.680 --> 2:33:49.680
 Yeah.

2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:50.680
 So it's top down.

2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:52.760
 It's not, it's not agent based.

2:33:52.760 --> 2:33:54.640
 And then this, I'm just open on random pages.

2:33:54.640 --> 2:33:57.360
 I think it's very relevant here.

2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:01.200
 The process, this is referring to Minsky, not the software, maybe the software.

2:34:01.200 --> 2:34:02.200
 I don't know.

2:34:02.200 --> 2:34:05.920
 The process can be captured in an extremely simple causal chain.

2:34:05.920 --> 2:34:09.320
 Capital determines output, output determines employment, the rate of employment determines

2:34:09.320 --> 2:34:14.400
 the rate of change of wages, output minus wages and interest payments determines profit.

2:34:14.400 --> 2:34:17.960
 The profit rate determines the, there's a very nice circuit here.

2:34:17.960 --> 2:34:23.560
 The profit rate determines the level of investment, which is the change in capital, which takes

2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:26.240
 us back to the beginning of this causal chain.

2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:32.600
 And the difference between investment and profits determines the change in private debt.

2:34:32.600 --> 2:34:39.040
 And there's some nice, the Keen Minsky model and the intermittent route to chaos on page

2:34:39.040 --> 2:34:40.540
 86 of your book.

2:34:40.540 --> 2:34:42.680
 These are, do these come from the software?

2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:43.680
 Yeah.

2:34:43.680 --> 2:34:44.680
 Yeah.

2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:50.240
 Mathematica, back in 1992, August, not in 1992.

2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:51.960
 Mathematica is another amazing piece of software.

2:34:51.960 --> 2:34:52.960
 Yeah.

2:34:52.960 --> 2:34:55.120
 I find it, it's very much a program as approached to mathematics.

2:34:55.120 --> 2:35:00.680
 I prefer like a program called MathCAD, which is what I'm using for all my, when I do my

2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:03.960
 mathematics on the computer, I write MathCAD.

2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:05.480
 CAD, CAD or CAB?

2:35:05.480 --> 2:35:06.480
 CAD.

2:35:06.480 --> 2:35:09.360
 It's been ruined by bad management.

2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:13.400
 They chucked out all the good engineers and I'm still using a version, which is 12 years

2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:14.400
 old.

2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:16.520
 The engineers ruled the world.

2:35:16.520 --> 2:35:20.640
 If only engineers, rather than this particular case, there was a bunch of marketers for CAD

2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:21.640
 software agreed.

2:35:21.640 --> 2:35:24.000
 I'm definitely a fan of engineers.

2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:26.120
 What are the plots that we're looking at here?

2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:31.440
 Growth rate, private debt ratio, employment versus wages, employment versus debt, income

2:35:31.440 --> 2:35:32.440
 distribution.

2:35:32.440 --> 2:35:36.160
 So this is across years, like different tradeoffs.

2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:39.480
 Is there something interesting to say about the plots and the insights from those plots

2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:41.880
 that are generated by the software?

2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:48.280
 That's a particular parameter values to give that outcome, but what happened when I first

2:35:48.280 --> 2:35:49.280
 simulated the model?

2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:53.920
 I took a model by a guy called Richard Goodwin, who's one of the great neglected economists,

2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:59.800
 American Marxist, mathematical Marxist, and what he did was build a model of cycles.

2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:06.920
 He actually wrote a paper called, it's only about a five page paper published in a book

2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:09.800
 and a very, very obscure conference paper.

2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:13.640
 What he was doing was trying to build a model of Marx.

2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:19.640
 So he wrote it in 1967, and it was putting in a mathematical form of model that Marx

2:36:19.640 --> 2:36:21.680
 came up with in 1867.

2:36:21.680 --> 2:36:24.520
 So it was a centenary birthday present to Marx.

2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:36.720
 What Marx had argued in Chapter 25, I think, of Volume 1 of Capital, Section 3, he built

2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:40.880
 a verbal model of a cyclical system, and it's quite out of character with the rest of the

2:36:40.880 --> 2:36:41.880
 book.

2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:47.000
 So when you read Volume 1 of Capital, people think Marx has got a commodity money, a view

2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:48.000
 of money.

2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:49.000
 He doesn't at all.

2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:51.720
 The idea was he had like an onion.

2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:54.840
 You start off on the middle level, and you ignore the outer layer, then you bring the

2:36:54.840 --> 2:36:56.440
 outer layer, and so on and so forth.

2:36:56.440 --> 2:37:00.720
 Anyway, in this model, in Volume 1 of Capital, he normally, just to see him, work has got

2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:02.200
 a subsistence wage.

2:37:02.200 --> 2:37:03.200
 That's it.

2:37:03.200 --> 2:37:12.040
 In this little chapter, he said that if the economy is booming, then workers will demand

2:37:12.040 --> 2:37:18.200
 wage rises, and the wage rises will cut into the profit so that capitalists will not get

2:37:18.200 --> 2:37:20.520
 the level of profit they're expecting.

2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:25.440
 Therefore they will invest less, and the economy will slump, and the slump will mean workers

2:37:25.440 --> 2:37:28.920
 become unemployed and have to accept wage cuts.

2:37:28.920 --> 2:37:31.120
 And it was a model of a cyclical economy.

2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:35.680
 And as it happens, Marx spent his later years trying to learn enough calculus to be able

2:37:35.680 --> 2:37:38.800
 to model it himself mathematically, and he never managed it.

2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:42.840
 There's Marx's mathematical notes on calculus, which are quite fun to read, and if you have

2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:43.840
 a mathematical background.

2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:44.840
 Did he get far?

2:37:44.840 --> 2:37:50.520
 No, he got too caught up in the whole philosophy, and he never really got to build the model.

2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:54.360
 But what Goodman realized was a predator prey model.

2:37:54.360 --> 2:37:57.920
 The Loctovolterra model was the basis of the idea.

2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:04.160
 So what the idea is you have a prey, and the very example that Loctovolterra actually used

2:38:04.160 --> 2:38:07.440
 initially was grass.

2:38:07.440 --> 2:38:08.680
 Grass is the prey.

2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:12.200
 And then you have a predator, and the predator were cows.

2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:16.760
 So you start off with a very few cows, and lots of grass, and then because there's lots

2:38:16.760 --> 2:38:21.520
 of grass, the numbers of cows grow, and then because the cows grow, they start to eat the

2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:22.520
 grass.

2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:25.400
 So the grass runs out, so the cows starve, and you get a cycle.

2:38:25.400 --> 2:38:28.840
 And what Loctovolterra was amazed by was that the cycles were persistent.

2:38:28.840 --> 2:38:30.040
 They didn't die out.

2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:33.920
 So Goodman got that vision, and he then built a predator prey model.

2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:37.600
 And I, first of all, read Goodman and really found it really hard to follow his writing.

2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:42.840
 He's not a very good writer, but a guy called John Blatt, who was a professor of mathematics

2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:48.480
 at New South Wales University, wrote a brilliant explanation of Goodman's model in a book called

2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:52.720
 Dynamic Economic Systems, and I read that, it was superb, and he said, the way you could

2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:55.880
 extend this was to include finance.

2:38:55.880 --> 2:39:00.440
 So I thought, okay, what I'm going to have is that what Goodman presumed is, capitalists

2:39:00.440 --> 2:39:02.720
 invest all their profits.

2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:08.600
 So you get a boom when there's a high rate of profit because they invest all that money,

2:39:08.600 --> 2:39:13.000
 and then a slump when there's low profit because depreciation will wipe away capital

2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:14.840
 and you'll go boom and slump.

2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:20.600
 So I simply added in, well, capitalists will invest more than their profits during a boom,

2:39:20.600 --> 2:39:23.760
 but less than their profits during a slump.

2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:27.360
 And that therefore means they had to borrow money to finance the gap and pay interest on

2:39:27.360 --> 2:39:28.360
 the debt.

2:39:28.360 --> 2:39:32.640
 So I ended up with a model with just three system states, the income share, the wages

2:39:32.640 --> 2:39:38.240
 distribution of income from workers, capitalists, and bankers, the level of employment, and

2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:40.560
 the level of private debt.

2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:45.760
 And those three equations are fundamentally like going from the Locta Volterra model with

2:39:45.760 --> 2:39:50.640
 just two equations, and therefore you get a fixed cycle to the Lorenz model where you

2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:51.880
 have three.

2:39:51.880 --> 2:39:54.240
 And therefore what I got out of it was a chaotic outcome.

2:39:54.240 --> 2:40:00.520
 So what you're seeing is a manifestation of chaos complexity in those plots.

2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:05.960
 But the fascinating, one of the many fascinating parts about it was that as the level of private

2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:12.400
 debt rose, in my model I had capitalists being the only ones who borrowed, but the people

2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:17.440
 who paid for the high level of private debt were the workers.

2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:22.680
 The rising bankers share corresponded exactly to a falling workers share.

2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:26.560
 So you can infer from that that the workers are the ones paying?

2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:27.560
 Effectively.

2:40:27.560 --> 2:40:28.560
 The workers end up paying for it.

2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:30.200
 They get a lower level of wages.

2:40:30.200 --> 2:40:36.080
 And the basic dynamic is that capitalists, when you have a three social class system,

2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:38.800
 your income goes between workers, capitalists, and bankers.

2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:41.840
 Now in the system, the good one did, they're just workers and capitalists.

2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:45.360
 So workers share rose, capitalists share had to fall.

2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:49.160
 But when you have three social classes, then capitalists share can remain constant while

2:40:49.160 --> 2:40:53.560
 workers fall and bankers, workers falls and bankers rise.

2:40:53.560 --> 2:40:55.560
 So that's what actually happened.

2:40:55.560 --> 2:40:59.560
 Because capitalists, the simple way I modeled it was there's a certain rate of profit at

2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:02.120
 which capitalists invest all their profits.

2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:05.600
 Above that they borrow more, below that they pay off debt.

2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:09.800
 So what would happen is when you got back to that point, then the level of investment

2:41:09.800 --> 2:41:13.240
 would be a precise share of GDP.

2:41:13.240 --> 2:41:15.960
 And therefore you'd get a precise rate of economic growth.

2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:20.720
 But if there was a higher percentage going to bankers and offset by a lower share going

2:41:20.720 --> 2:41:23.120
 to workers, it didn't affect the capitalists.

2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:31.680
 So what you get is the cycles sort of diminish for a while because there's the income distribution

2:41:31.680 --> 2:41:32.680
 effect is important.

2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:37.120
 So the workers pay for the increasing level of debt.

2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:41.000
 But the other side of it was that the cycles were diminished for a while.

2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:45.640
 What you get is a period of diminishing cycles, then leading to rising cycles.

2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:51.960
 And technically this is known as the Pommer Manneville route to chaos.

2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:57.560
 And it's one particular element of Lorenz's equations of fluid dynamics.

2:41:57.560 --> 2:42:03.120
 So what they found was in examining laminar flow and a fluid, you have a period where

2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:07.560
 the laminar flow got more laminar and then suddenly it has started to get less laminar

2:42:07.560 --> 2:42:09.760
 and go turbulent.

2:42:09.760 --> 2:42:12.520
 And this is what actually goes on in the model.

2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:19.040
 So in my model of Minsky, so what you have is a period where there's big berms and cycles

2:42:19.040 --> 2:42:23.640
 and then as the debt level rises, the berms and slums get smaller.

2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:28.000
 And that looks like what neoclassical economists call the great moderation.

2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:33.720
 So when I first modeled this in 1982, I finished up my paper, which is published in 95, but

2:42:33.720 --> 2:42:38.960
 what I thought was a nice rhetorical flourish, saying the chaotic dynamics of this paper

2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:43.360
 should warn us against regarding a period of relative stability in a capitalist economy

2:42:43.360 --> 2:42:45.720
 as anything more than a lull before the storm.

2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:47.720
 Now, I thought it was a great speed of rhetoric.

2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:50.120
 I didn't think it was going to fucking happen.

2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:55.880
 But it did because you had this period from 1990 through to 2007, where there were diminishing

2:42:55.880 --> 2:43:00.400
 cycles and the neoclassicals labeled that the great moderation and they took the credit

2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:01.400
 for it.

2:43:01.400 --> 2:43:06.480
 They thought that the economy was being managed by them to a lower rate of inflation, a lower

2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:11.840
 level of unemployment, less instability over time, and they literally took credit for it.

2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:16.040
 And I was watching that and thinking, that's like my model running and I'm scared of shit

2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:17.600
 that there'll be a breakdown.

2:43:17.600 --> 2:43:23.280
 I ended up not working in the area for a while because I wrote debunking economics.

2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:28.760
 And I got involved in a fight over the modeling of competition in neoclassical theory.

2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:31.320
 That took me away for about four or five years.

2:43:31.320 --> 2:43:40.280
 And then I got asked to do a court case in 2005, end of 2005, and I used Minsky as my

2:43:40.280 --> 2:43:44.880
 framework for arguing that somebody who was involved in predatory lending should be able

2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:47.440
 to get out of the debt they were in.

2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:52.440
 And I explained Minsky's theory and I used this run it throwaway line of saying, debt

2:43:52.440 --> 2:43:55.880
 levels, private debt, if you're rising exponentially.

2:43:55.880 --> 2:43:59.800
 And then I thought, well, I can't, as an expert, just make a claim like that, I've got to check

2:43:59.800 --> 2:44:01.360
 the data.

2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:03.280
 And the debt ratio was rising exponentially.

2:44:03.280 --> 2:44:07.040
 And I thought, holy shit, we're in for a financial crisis.

2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:10.840
 And somebody has to warn about it, at least in Australia, I was that somebody.

2:44:10.840 --> 2:44:16.680
 So can you, given this chaotic dynamics idea, can you talk about the crisis ahead of us

2:44:16.680 --> 2:44:17.680
 in the future?

2:44:17.680 --> 2:44:21.800
 So one of the things, I mean, it's a fundamental question of economics.

2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:26.320
 Is economics about understanding the past or predicting the future?

2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:37.520
 Because you can construct models that do poetic, like in 95 poetic, you know, and then you

2:44:37.520 --> 2:44:43.840
 can, you know, watch years fly by and some of the predictions in retrospect that you

2:44:43.840 --> 2:44:50.120
 make turn out to be true, but you know, all kinds of gurus throughout history have done

2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:54.960
 that kind of thing, and you can call yourself right and forget all the many times you've

2:44:54.960 --> 2:44:55.960
 been wrong.

2:44:55.960 --> 2:44:57.800
 Let's talk about the future.

2:44:57.800 --> 2:45:02.520
 What kind of stuff, you mentioned about the importance of the biosphere, but what are

2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:10.640
 the crises that are ahead of us that a chaotic dynamics view allows us to predict and be

2:45:10.640 --> 2:45:11.640
 concerned about?

2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:15.840
 What really I saw coming out of it, leaving aside the ecological, wasn't a crisis.

2:45:15.840 --> 2:45:21.200
 It was stagnation because what we got out of the crisis was caused by a rising level

2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:23.280
 of private debt.

2:45:23.280 --> 2:45:29.680
 Now you reach a peak level where the willingness to take on debt collapses.

2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:32.880
 And so you go to a period where debt is rising all the time.

2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:38.240
 So credit, which is the annual change in debt, and that's credit as part of aggregate demand

2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:39.920
 and aggregate income.

2:45:39.920 --> 2:45:43.560
 So credit goes from positive to negative, and that causes a slump.

2:45:43.560 --> 2:45:48.320
 Can you describe why that causes a slump?

2:45:48.320 --> 2:45:49.400
 Credit goes to negative.

2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:54.560
 If you ask Paul Krugman, he'll tell you credit plays no role in aggregate demand.

2:45:54.560 --> 2:45:55.940
 Give me a second.

2:45:55.940 --> 2:45:58.760
 Credit plays no role in aggregate demand.

2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:02.200
 So the vision that the neoclassicals have for the banking system is what they call

2:46:02.200 --> 2:46:03.960
 learnable funds.

2:46:03.960 --> 2:46:10.440
 Is Paul Krugman, by the way, the knight at the front of the army that is the neoclassical

2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:11.440
 economist?

2:46:11.440 --> 2:46:12.440
 Yeah, fundamentally.

2:46:12.440 --> 2:46:13.440
 Sure.

2:46:13.440 --> 2:46:21.360
 He's politically reasonable, which makes him more dangerous than those that aren't.

2:46:21.360 --> 2:46:22.360
 He's politically...

2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:25.680
 Yeah, there's quite a lot of people that would disagree with that characterization of Paul

2:46:25.680 --> 2:46:28.280
 Krugman as he's politically reasonable.

2:46:28.280 --> 2:46:29.280
 You should see the people behind it.

2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:30.280
 The alternatives.

2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:31.280
 Okay.

2:46:31.280 --> 2:46:32.280
 Fair enough.

2:46:32.280 --> 2:46:33.280
 Okay.

2:46:33.280 --> 2:46:36.440
 That's not a negative or positive statement, that's just he can be feisty as well.

2:46:36.440 --> 2:46:37.440
 Oh, he can.

2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:38.440
 He can.

2:46:38.440 --> 2:46:40.240
 But he's like the human face of neoclassical economics.

2:46:40.240 --> 2:46:41.240
 Sure.

2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:42.960
 He doesn't deserve having a human face.

2:46:42.960 --> 2:46:45.680
 It's an anti human theory, but he's the human face.

2:46:45.680 --> 2:46:46.680
 Absolutely.

2:46:46.680 --> 2:46:47.680
 You really think, I got you.

2:46:47.680 --> 2:46:48.680
 All right.

2:46:48.680 --> 2:46:54.280
 Well, so the credit does not have any effect on aggregate demand.

2:46:54.280 --> 2:46:55.280
 In their model.

2:46:55.280 --> 2:46:56.880
 In your saying, that's not the case at all.

2:46:56.880 --> 2:46:58.960
 It's absolutely crucial to aggregate demand.

2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:03.400
 So what they model is, again, the example of you lending to me or vice versa.

2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:07.640
 If I lend money to you, I can spend less, you can spend more.

2:47:07.640 --> 2:47:10.960
 So credit is the change in debt.

2:47:10.960 --> 2:47:16.480
 So if there's, if I lend money to you, then there's a level of private debt rises.

2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:17.480
 Okay.

2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:21.160
 So there's an increase in credit, but that increase in credit comes at an expense of

2:47:21.160 --> 2:47:22.800
 my spending power.

2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:26.800
 So you can spend what I've lent you, but I can't spend what I've lent you.

2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:28.120
 So credit cancels out.

2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:30.560
 But when you look at, that's learnable funds.

2:47:30.560 --> 2:47:34.160
 But in the real world, and the Bank of England has said this is the real world and the textbooks

2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:38.840
 are wrong, categorically in 2014.

2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:43.920
 In the bank lens, it adds to its asset side and says, you owe us more money.

2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:47.440
 And it adds to its liability side and says, here's the money in your bank account.

2:47:47.440 --> 2:47:49.400
 Now you spend that money.

2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:53.960
 So what happens when you do your sums, credit is part of aggregate demand and aggregate

2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:54.960
 income.

2:47:54.960 --> 2:48:02.160
 And that's something I first solved in 2019, I think, 2000, only recently proved it mathematically.

2:48:02.160 --> 2:48:08.520
 So what that means is credit is a component of aggregate demand and credit is also very

2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:09.520
 volatile.

2:48:09.520 --> 2:48:13.800
 It's like consumption demand never goes negative, investment demand never goes negative, but

2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:16.040
 credit can go from positive to negative.

2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:21.600
 And when you take a look at the long run of American history after the Second World War,

2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:28.320
 there was no period until 2007 where credit was negative, it was a positive component

2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:34.480
 of your positive number, therefore, when you do it as a percentage of GDP, it was a positive

2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:42.800
 percentage of GDP, it peaked at 16% of GDP in 2006, 2007.

2:48:42.800 --> 2:48:47.480
 It fell to minus 5% in 2008, 2009.

2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:51.940
 So you had a 20% of GDP turn around in aggregate demand.

2:48:51.940 --> 2:49:00.560
 Now when you plot that against unemployment, the correlation of credit to unemployment

2:49:00.560 --> 2:49:10.520
 across the period from about 1990 to 2010 is about minus 0.9, enormous negative correlation.

2:49:10.520 --> 2:49:14.320
 Now according to the neoclassicals, it could be close to zero.

2:49:14.320 --> 2:49:18.160
 Empirically it's bleedingly obvious it's not, and it applies to every country in the

2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:21.520
 world that had a financial crisis at that period.

2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:26.640
 So it's bleedingly obvious in the data, and they ignore it because credit's not part

2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:27.640
 of their model.

2:49:27.640 --> 2:49:30.720
 And you're saying it's causation, not just cause.

2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:31.720
 It's causal.

2:49:31.720 --> 2:49:35.960
 Today we sit there as extremely high inflation.

2:49:35.960 --> 2:49:42.520
 What does inflation, what role does inflation play in this picture is a little bit of inflation

2:49:42.520 --> 2:49:43.520
 good.

2:49:43.520 --> 2:49:48.320
 We talked about money creation at the beginning.

2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:52.720
 What's a little bit of inflation good or bad, a lot of inflation good or bad, how concerned

2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:53.720
 are you about?

2:49:53.720 --> 2:49:57.120
 A little bit of inflation is good for a simple reason, like the game has taken me a while

2:49:57.120 --> 2:50:01.040
 to get my head around this, but if you think about how people say, what are the functions

2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:02.040
 of money?

2:50:02.040 --> 2:50:04.760
 They say money, it's a unit of account that you're measuring.

2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:09.280
 It's a means of exchange, and it's a store of value.

2:50:09.280 --> 2:50:15.040
 Now yes, okay, it has those three roles, but the last one is contradictory to the previous

2:50:15.040 --> 2:50:20.280
 two, because, and this is where you see this with the Bitcoin phenomenon, if you want to

2:50:20.280 --> 2:50:27.880
 hang on to money as a store of value, then if prices are falling, the value of money

2:50:27.880 --> 2:50:33.400
 is rising, and it's actually in your interests as a store of value to hang on to it and not

2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:35.320
 spend it.

2:50:35.320 --> 2:50:39.280
 So that contradicts its role as a means of exchange.

2:50:39.280 --> 2:50:44.320
 Now if you have money which depreciates, and this was actually tried in the Austrian town

2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:48.440
 of Wargel during the Great Depression.

2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:53.320
 If you have money that depreciates, then if you don't use it, you'll lose it fundamentally.

2:50:53.320 --> 2:50:55.520
 So it has a high rate of circulation.

2:50:55.520 --> 2:51:01.760
 So there's a monetary theorist called Silvio Gizel, and he wrote this proposal that money

2:51:01.760 --> 2:51:07.720
 should depreciate, and he was ridiculed and opposed and derided, but Keynes said he was

2:51:07.720 --> 2:51:09.640
 a great intellect.

2:51:09.640 --> 2:51:15.640
 And the mayor of town of Wargel in Austria during the Great Depression was facing an

2:51:15.640 --> 2:51:20.600
 unemployment rate of 25% pretty much that Germany had the worst experience in the Great

2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:25.560
 Depression in the world, as bad as America, slightly worse than America.

2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:28.560
 And so he thought, how can I stimulate demand here?

2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:34.880
 So he produced a script which could only be used for buying goods and services in Wargel

2:51:34.880 --> 2:51:39.360
 and could be used to pay your local rates, but it was depreciated by putting a stamp

2:51:39.360 --> 2:51:41.440
 on the money if you didn't use it.

2:51:41.440 --> 2:51:45.680
 So what happened was people would pay their rates, they needed to pay the rates using

2:51:45.680 --> 2:51:49.160
 this money, so the script, so they used the script.

2:51:49.160 --> 2:51:52.720
 And because it depreciated, you'd use it rapidly.

2:51:52.720 --> 2:51:58.200
 So people were using that money, this alternative to the Austrian shilling, and the economic

2:51:58.200 --> 2:52:02.000
 activity in town took off and unemployment fell to zero.

2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:06.000
 And it was an absolute miracle, and everybody loved a Wargel experiment, and the Austrian

2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:12.360
 central bank sued them for establishing an alternative form of money and shut it down.

2:52:12.360 --> 2:52:20.240
 Unemployment went back up to 25% again, and Austria voted 99.6% for the Nazis, something

2:52:20.240 --> 2:52:23.120
 crazy number like that when Hitler marched in.

2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:29.680
 So the Wargel experiment showed that a depreciating currency led to a high rate of circulation,

2:52:29.680 --> 2:52:33.640
 but of course we're not talking via our republic levels of inflation.

2:52:33.640 --> 2:52:40.280
 So when you get that much inflation, and that's normally caused by, as the Weimar inflation

2:52:40.280 --> 2:52:46.040
 was caused by, the reparation terms imposed on Germany, fundamentally by France at the

2:52:46.040 --> 2:52:52.120
 3D Versailles, they paid a large part of that with just basically printing the notes, and

2:52:52.120 --> 2:52:54.840
 you ended this crazy period of hyperinflation.

2:52:54.840 --> 2:52:58.440
 So hyperinflation almost always occurs when there's a massive destruction of physical

2:52:58.440 --> 2:53:02.960
 resources, and the Monetary Authority tries to pay that literally over it, and then you

2:53:02.960 --> 2:53:05.720
 get hyperinflation, that's total social breakdown.

2:53:05.720 --> 2:53:13.120
 So a moderate level of inflation inspires the means of exchange uses of money, but undermines

2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:21.800
 the store of value usage of money, and that dilemma is why we have this antagonistic attitude

2:53:21.800 --> 2:53:22.800
 towards inflation.

2:53:22.800 --> 2:53:23.800
 Yeah.

2:53:23.800 --> 2:53:31.120
 I mean, you're describing his attention, but it nevertheless is like money is the store

2:53:31.120 --> 2:53:37.080
 of value and a means of exchange, and I don't, to push back, it's not necessarily that there's

2:53:37.080 --> 2:53:42.680
 a tension, it's just that depending on the dynamics of this beautiful economic system

2:53:42.680 --> 2:53:45.800
 of ours, it's used as one more than the other.

2:53:45.800 --> 2:53:53.360
 If there is inflation, you're using it more for the means of exchange, it's deflation

2:53:53.360 --> 2:53:59.200
 using more for store value, but I don't see there's a tension, that's just how much you

2:53:59.200 --> 2:54:01.320
 use it for those different...

2:54:01.320 --> 2:54:07.240
 But it ends up saying that overall, the level of effective commerce, a bit of inflation

2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:11.560
 is a good thing, because that's depreciating the money slightly and encourage its use.

2:54:11.560 --> 2:54:20.400
 Yeah, but so the argument that it's a Bitcoin folks use or gold standard folks, again, HODL

2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:29.320
 is not an argument, that having an inflation of zero is actually achieving that balance.

2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:30.320
 Yeah.

2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:31.320
 Right?

2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:32.320
 So like, yeah.

2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:36.200
 But if they're actually in favor of negative, they want it to appreciate rapidly, and there's

2:54:36.200 --> 2:54:42.960
 a definitely negative inflation, the value of the money rising relative to commodities,

2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:45.600
 that's what they want, that's the HODL philosophy.

2:54:45.600 --> 2:54:50.360
 Well, that's more of like an investment, I don't know if that's more of investment

2:54:50.360 --> 2:54:55.720
 philosophy than the fundamental principles of why they believe in cryptocurrency, in

2:54:55.720 --> 2:54:58.120
 forced scarcity as a model.

2:54:58.120 --> 2:55:06.360
 The concern there is that when you print money, the public policy is detached from the actual,

2:55:06.360 --> 2:55:07.360
 from value.

2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:08.360
 Yeah.

2:55:08.360 --> 2:55:09.360
 Well, you get...

2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:13.160
 I mean, this is where again, it matters to get money creation right, because the government's

2:55:13.160 --> 2:55:18.960
 not the only money creator, banks are as well, private banks.

2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:25.040
 And if we obsess too much about limiting government money creation, what we end up getting, if

2:55:25.040 --> 2:55:28.920
 there is money creation going on, it's private banks doing it, and you get an increase in

2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:36.680
 private debt, and fundamentally, private debt and its collapse, collapse of credit when

2:55:36.680 --> 2:55:41.160
 it stops growing, that's the fundamental cause of financial crises.

2:55:41.160 --> 2:55:42.160
 So...

2:55:42.160 --> 2:55:46.160
 Yeah, but the question is, what's the cost of the collapse of the...

2:55:46.160 --> 2:55:51.960
 Well, I think this is like the Austrian thinking leaves out the debt deflation, and that's

2:55:51.960 --> 2:55:52.960
 like...

2:55:52.960 --> 2:55:56.880
 I think one of the most important papers ever written was by Irving Fischer called the debt

2:55:56.880 --> 2:55:59.600
 deflation theory of Great Depressions.

2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:02.600
 Fischer was somebody who accepted the neoclassical vision.

2:56:02.600 --> 2:56:09.280
 He wrote the pre efficiency market hypothesis, efficiency market hypothesis.

2:56:09.280 --> 2:56:14.680
 He had his own PhD called the theory of interest.

2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:21.920
 And in that, he argued effectively for a supply and demand analysis of the financial system.

2:56:21.920 --> 2:56:24.040
 And he argued for equilibrium.

2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:30.920
 He said, when you're working with a commodity market, then the sale and the transaction

2:56:30.920 --> 2:56:35.040
 and the exchange occur at the same point in time.

2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:39.520
 When you're working with a financial market, then the exchange occurs through time.

2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:45.880
 So he said, he assumed that debts are repaid, all debts are repaid.

2:56:45.880 --> 2:56:50.240
 And he assumed that equilibrium through time was an essential part of his assumption.

2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:51.240
 This is...

2:56:51.240 --> 2:56:58.280
 Now, then the Great Depression comes along and he has become a major shareholder in ranked

2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:03.600
 Xerox because he invented the Rolodex, is a tinkerer.

2:57:03.600 --> 2:57:09.320
 And so he had taken out shares on margin and he was worth about a hundred million in

2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:12.480
 modern terms when the Great Depression hit.

2:57:12.480 --> 2:57:14.880
 And 90% of that was share market valuation.

2:57:14.880 --> 2:57:18.120
 He'd taken out margin debt just like everybody else.

2:57:18.120 --> 2:57:24.080
 And with margin debt, you could put down $100,000 and buy a million dollars worth of shares.

2:57:24.080 --> 2:57:27.080
 So he got this huge leverage into debt.

2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:30.680
 Now that when the financial crisis hit, the level of margin debt in America had risen

2:57:30.680 --> 2:57:38.640
 from half a percent of GDP in 1920 to 13% of GDP in 1929.

2:57:38.640 --> 2:57:40.480
 He then fell to zero again.

2:57:40.480 --> 2:57:46.520
 That's why the stock market crash in 1929 was so devastating, that scale of margin lending.

2:57:46.520 --> 2:57:47.640
 And everybody was being wiped out.

2:57:47.640 --> 2:57:51.400
 They were selling Rolls Royce's for 20 quid, that you literally have photographs showing

2:57:51.400 --> 2:57:56.520
 people doing that because a margin call comes in, you've got to liquidate everything.

2:57:56.520 --> 2:58:02.160
 So he said, the danger of a debt deflation is what we have to avoid.

2:58:02.160 --> 2:58:08.360
 And that means you don't want too much private debt to accumulate and you don't want falling

2:58:08.360 --> 2:58:14.680
 prices because the falling prices will amplify the impact of being insolvent to begin with.

2:58:14.680 --> 2:58:16.800
 And that's what we saw in the Great Depression.

2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:22.800
 It's partially what we saw in 2007, but we didn't have anything like the level of margin

2:58:22.800 --> 2:58:23.800
 debt.

2:58:23.800 --> 2:58:29.120
 Margin debt was reduced from 90% to 50% ratio after the Great Depression.

2:58:29.120 --> 2:58:33.200
 So there were limits on how bad it was in 2007.

2:58:33.200 --> 2:58:38.640
 But the danger is still the period of deflation amplifies your debts.

2:58:38.640 --> 2:58:40.560
 And I call it Fisher's Paradox.

2:58:40.560 --> 2:58:44.800
 He didn't write those terms himself, but he wrote a line saying, the more debtors pay,

2:58:44.800 --> 2:58:47.120
 the more they owe.

2:58:47.120 --> 2:58:52.400
 And this is because you're liquidating to try to meet your own debts.

2:58:52.400 --> 2:58:55.120
 When you liquidate, the price level falls.

2:58:55.120 --> 2:59:00.320
 You will end up having a lower level of monetary debt, but a higher level of debt when you

2:59:00.320 --> 2:59:02.360
 deflate it using the price level.

2:59:02.360 --> 2:59:08.000
 So the biggest danger in capitalism is the debt deflation, far more dangerous than inflation.

2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:11.040
 And the cause of debt deflation is?

2:59:11.040 --> 2:59:14.560
 Too much lending, too much bank lending, too much private money creation.

2:59:14.560 --> 2:59:21.200
 And if you take a look at the 1920s, Calvin Coolidge explained the boom of the 1920s on

2:59:21.200 --> 2:59:22.200
 his surplus.

2:59:22.200 --> 2:59:27.680
 He said, my government running a surplus of 1% of GDP pretty much from 1922 through to

2:59:27.680 --> 2:59:30.600
 1930 is the foundation of our stability.

2:59:30.600 --> 2:59:31.600
 It should be continued.

2:59:31.600 --> 2:59:37.440
 What he didn't look at was that over that same time period, on average, Americans were

2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:42.320
 borrowing 5% of GDP per year from the private banks.

2:59:42.320 --> 2:59:46.440
 So you had a housing bubble at the beginning of the 1920s, which Richard Vague covers beautifully

2:59:46.440 --> 2:59:49.680
 in the brief history of DOOM.

2:59:49.680 --> 2:59:54.480
 And then you had this huge rise in margin debt as well, gigantic increase in margin

2:59:54.480 --> 2:59:55.640
 debt.

2:59:55.640 --> 2:59:58.600
 So all this borrowed money was being spent into the economy.

2:59:58.600 --> 3:00:02.080
 And this is where credit becomes part of aggregate demand, and it's both not just for goods

3:00:02.080 --> 3:00:05.760
 and services, it's also for shares and houses and so on.

3:00:05.760 --> 3:00:07.960
 So a huge valuation effect.

3:00:07.960 --> 3:00:13.280
 But then when the margin debt turned around, when people would not take out margin debt

3:00:13.280 --> 3:00:16.160
 anymore, the demand for margin debt disappeared.

3:00:16.160 --> 3:00:22.360
 And then it was what we call badly a positive feedback loop is actually an amplifying feedback

3:00:22.360 --> 3:00:23.360
 loop.

3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:25.200
 And that caused a collapse.

3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:30.240
 So what elements of that do you see today that we need to fix and how do we fix it?

3:00:30.240 --> 3:00:35.480
 We have to regard the level of private debt as a target of economic policy, just as much

3:00:35.480 --> 3:00:38.720
 as the rate of inflation or the rate of unemployment.

3:00:38.720 --> 3:00:41.360
 What is the moderate amount of private debt that's good?

3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:45.480
 I would say something of anywhere between 30% and 70% of GDP.

3:00:45.480 --> 3:00:47.600
 What is it currently?

3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:49.880
 In America, it's 170%.

3:00:49.880 --> 3:00:50.880
 Nice.

3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:51.880
 Of GDP.

3:00:51.880 --> 3:00:52.880
 Of GDP.

3:00:52.880 --> 3:00:53.880
 Oh, that's nice.

3:00:53.880 --> 3:01:00.760
 After we talk, but I can show you the data in this, and it is just this huge increase

3:01:00.760 --> 3:01:02.760
 in private debt.

3:01:02.760 --> 3:01:10.040
 First of all, cause the boom, but then financing the credit causes, ultimately causes the slump.

3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:16.320
 And so if we remove the rate level at which debt can reach and we stop speculative lending

3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:23.360
 and they have a lending for both innovation, investment and essential consumption items,

3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:25.200
 we won't have the slump on the other side.

3:01:25.200 --> 3:01:27.480
 We can get rid of financial instability.

3:01:27.480 --> 3:01:31.280
 We can't stop financial cycles, but we can stop financial breakdown.

3:01:31.280 --> 3:01:35.320
 And so we should really be focusing on the instability and getting that out of control.

3:01:35.320 --> 3:01:40.920
 By the way, as you point to your laptop, my laptops, I have a lot of, how many computers

3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:41.920
 do I have?

3:01:41.920 --> 3:01:46.400
 A lot of them, but my little surface, whatever the heck this thing is, is getting definite

3:01:46.400 --> 3:01:47.400
 size envy.

3:01:47.400 --> 3:01:50.360
 Cause your laptop you said is 18 something inches.

3:01:50.360 --> 3:01:51.360
 18.4 inches.

3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:52.360
 18.4 inches.

3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:58.480
 Um, you know, I don't think I've ever seen one that big and I'll give the internet that

3:01:58.480 --> 3:01:59.480
 one.

3:01:59.480 --> 3:02:00.480
 All right.

3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:01.480
 Um, that's for the graphics.

3:02:01.480 --> 3:02:06.920
 So it's the gaming laptop, it's basically a desktop, it probably weighs like 40 pounds.

3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:16.720
 You have to eight kilos, eight kilos, eight kilos, that's, you know, you're in the power

3:02:16.720 --> 3:02:17.720
 supply for it.

3:02:17.720 --> 3:02:18.720
 It's over there somewhere.

3:02:18.720 --> 3:02:20.960
 The power supply weighs about twice as much as your laptop.

3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:22.960
 Yeah.

3:02:22.960 --> 3:02:23.960
 And you have to power it on with a crank.

3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:24.960
 Pretty close.

3:02:24.960 --> 3:02:25.960
 You have to like pull it.

3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:26.960
 Is it gas powered or is it coal?

3:02:26.960 --> 3:02:31.880
 Oh, well, I feel like it's a nuclear power station and spotter and a nuclear diamond in

3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:32.880
 the back there.

3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:33.880
 Okay.

3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:40.680
 So, um, let me, before I forget, just let me ask you about, we've, we've covered brilliantly

3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:46.240
 the, the, the nuance disagreements you have and the wisdom you've drawn from Karl Marx.

3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:54.600
 But there's also, like you mentioned in popular discourse, um, a kind of distorted use of

3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:55.600
 different terms.

3:02:55.600 --> 3:02:58.000
 And one of them is Marxism today.

3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:05.840
 Is there something you could just speak to about, you know, increased use of that word?

3:03:05.840 --> 3:03:06.840
 And is it misused?

3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:11.360
 Is it concern you that there's a lot of actually young people that say they're sort of proudly

3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:12.360
 Marxist?

3:03:12.360 --> 3:03:13.360
 Yeah.

3:03:13.360 --> 3:03:15.560
 Uh, are they misusing the term?

3:03:15.560 --> 3:03:20.920
 They are definitely misusing the term if they don't understand the use value, exchange value

3:03:20.920 --> 3:03:22.920
 dialectic I went through earlier.

3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:30.960
 Uh, so, so if I could, if I could just pause the idea of socialism and Marxism is used

3:03:30.960 --> 3:03:39.480
 in sort of popular lingo, it's basically, you know, um, a lot of people have a disproportionately

3:03:39.480 --> 3:03:40.880
 hard life.

3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:43.840
 Why can't we help them out?

3:03:43.840 --> 3:03:50.040
 Why can't we be kind to our fellow man kind of that's, that's a short embodiment of an

3:03:50.040 --> 3:03:57.480
 idea as opposed to some super complicated, uh, elaborate model of the economy and politics

3:03:57.480 --> 3:03:58.480
 and all that kind of stuff.

3:03:58.480 --> 3:03:59.480
 Yeah.

3:03:59.480 --> 3:04:02.880
 I mean, we could do that by using the insights that come out of modern monetary theory, which

3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:06.200
 I've confirmed just using my simple Minsky models.

3:04:06.200 --> 3:04:10.800
 And that is that to use the term, usually a feature, not a bug, a government running

3:04:10.800 --> 3:04:17.120
 a deficit is a feature of a well functioning mixed fiat credit economy, not a bug.

3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:21.000
 The government should normally run a deficit because that's how the government creates

3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:22.000
 money.

3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:26.160
 Now, because we've had this obsession from mainstream economists of running a surplus,

3:04:26.160 --> 3:04:30.840
 which is what caused the Great Depression, Calvin Kuhl is doing it for eight years because

3:04:30.840 --> 3:04:35.960
 of that obsession with cutback on social services, with cutback on health, with cutback on education,

3:04:35.960 --> 3:04:37.320
 with cutback on infrastructure.

3:04:37.320 --> 3:04:41.440
 Now, all that stuff for dominantly affects the poor because the rich can afford to buy

3:04:41.440 --> 3:04:42.440
 it themselves.

3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:47.520
 So if we had a son of which realized the government should run a deficit, it's a feature, not

3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:50.480
 a bug of a fiat money system.

3:04:50.480 --> 3:04:52.480
 And that's where he has made one mistake recently.

3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:53.480
 Okay.

3:04:53.480 --> 3:04:55.480
 I'm not going back to founded first principles.

3:04:55.480 --> 3:05:01.720
 That deficit enables you to provide enough of a decent standard of living for those who

3:05:01.720 --> 3:05:05.760
 don't come out on top in the, the capitalist game.

3:05:05.760 --> 3:05:08.680
 And with that, you wouldn't have the angst of the young people.

3:05:08.680 --> 3:05:15.160
 Now we still have the climate parameters within which we have to survive, but a decent level

3:05:15.160 --> 3:05:18.480
 of government funding would mean the angst that you get where people say, I want to be

3:05:18.480 --> 3:05:19.980
 a Marxist.

3:05:19.980 --> 3:05:23.680
 And they've got a, what I call a cardboard cutout version of Marx in their minds.

3:05:23.680 --> 3:05:25.480
 That wouldn't be happening.

3:05:25.480 --> 3:05:32.000
 So it's, it's potential to have a good society where the government runs a deficit that finances

3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:38.760
 the needs of the poor, where the rich get enough to indulge and take care of themselves.

3:05:38.760 --> 3:05:42.480
 And you, you don't get this breakdown if you, if you try to cause the government running

3:05:42.480 --> 3:05:47.320
 a surplus, then the burden of that is borne by the poor, middle class and poor.

3:05:47.320 --> 3:05:50.120
 And that will lead to the angst we're now seeing.

3:05:50.120 --> 3:05:51.120
 Beautiful.

3:05:51.120 --> 3:05:59.040
 That was a, that was a beautiful world wind exploration of all of economics and economics

3:05:59.040 --> 3:06:00.040
 history.

3:06:00.040 --> 3:06:03.480
 Let's get what you tweeted, I think.

3:06:03.480 --> 3:06:09.560
 We are the opposite of ants, individually intelligent, collectively stupid.

3:06:09.560 --> 3:06:17.200
 We need to develop systems thinking fast to counter our limitations.

3:06:17.200 --> 3:06:18.200
 That's really interesting.

3:06:18.200 --> 3:06:22.040
 Do you, do you really believe we're individually intelligent and collectively stupid?

3:06:22.040 --> 3:06:23.040
 I do.

3:06:23.040 --> 3:06:27.360
 Can you elaborate on, I mean, some of that is just cheeky tweets, but.

3:06:27.360 --> 3:06:31.280
 It was a cheeky tweet I've had from my mind for a long time.

3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:35.360
 It just is one that actually went moderately viral, not enough, but moderately viral for

3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:36.600
 me.

3:06:36.600 --> 3:06:40.480
 But nevertheless, what, if you could analyze it as if it's some deep profound statement

3:06:40.480 --> 3:06:41.480
 you made in a book.

3:06:41.480 --> 3:06:46.000
 Well, the reason is that we are the incredibly individually intelligent things like these

3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:47.680
 devices we're playing with now.

3:06:47.680 --> 3:06:49.920
 That's the creation of individual minds.

3:06:49.920 --> 3:06:53.240
 Creative individual mind and a collective labor of a century is that led to this level

3:06:53.240 --> 3:06:54.480
 of technology.

3:06:54.480 --> 3:06:55.880
 And that has to be respected.

3:06:55.880 --> 3:06:58.240
 That's incredible stuff.

3:06:58.240 --> 3:07:02.720
 But at the same time, I think what humans are, if you want to distinguish humans from

3:07:02.720 --> 3:07:06.720
 other species on the planet, we don't weave webs.

3:07:06.720 --> 3:07:08.520
 We don't make bird calls.

3:07:08.520 --> 3:07:10.160
 What we do is we share beliefs.

3:07:10.160 --> 3:07:11.160
 Yeah.

3:07:11.160 --> 3:07:12.160
 Okay.

3:07:12.160 --> 3:07:13.160
 Now.

3:07:13.160 --> 3:07:14.160
 You don't think that's awesome.

3:07:14.160 --> 3:07:16.600
 That's a, you don't think that's a catalyst for intelligence?

3:07:16.600 --> 3:07:21.160
 Yeah, it is a catalyst, but what it means is we can dilute ourselves as much as we can

3:07:21.160 --> 3:07:22.960
 inform ourselves.

3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:27.160
 So because we share beliefs, we can do things in a collective way.

3:07:27.160 --> 3:07:31.240
 And if we believe that, you know, we can, if we take the incantations of the witch doctors

3:07:31.240 --> 3:07:35.640
 and we, and we happen to have a couple of spears and things, we can go and attack the

3:07:35.640 --> 3:07:42.360
 local herd, a tribe of, of, of, of lines and drive them out and we become the dominant

3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:43.440
 species.

3:07:43.440 --> 3:07:48.840
 So it worked at the stage where we were in competition with other species on the planet.

3:07:48.840 --> 3:07:53.400
 Now that we're the dominant species, then our beliefs get in the way.

3:07:53.400 --> 3:07:59.520
 So you agree with, with Einstein who said, the only, there are only two things that are

3:07:59.520 --> 3:08:01.920
 infinite, the universe and human stupidity.

3:08:01.920 --> 3:08:03.400
 And he wasn't sure about the universe.

3:08:03.400 --> 3:08:05.640
 And he wasn't sure about the, right.

3:08:05.640 --> 3:08:06.640
 That's right.

3:08:06.640 --> 3:08:08.640
 And he wasn't sure about the universe.

3:08:08.640 --> 3:08:09.640
 Yeah.

3:08:09.640 --> 3:08:15.000
 So you think that the collective, I mean, there's an infinity to the destructive and

3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:20.000
 the, the stupid, the inhumane, that's possible when we humans get together, but it feels

3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:24.760
 like there's more trajectories, there's more possibility for creation.

3:08:24.760 --> 3:08:25.760
 There are.

3:08:25.760 --> 3:08:29.640
 And I think that's why we have to say, if we, if we were built around the idea that

3:08:29.640 --> 3:08:36.760
 our role as a species is to maintain and extend life on the planet and, and if not find it

3:08:36.760 --> 3:08:42.960
 elsewhere, then seed it elsewhere, then that is a vision which makes us creative and confines

3:08:42.960 --> 3:08:46.720
 the worst elements of our capacities to share beliefs.

3:08:46.720 --> 3:08:51.800
 So I, that's what I, my hope is that we'll reach that stage, but I think we've overshot

3:08:51.800 --> 3:08:58.440
 it so badly that my real fear is we'll end up blaming technology for the type of world

3:08:58.440 --> 3:09:01.480
 we find ourselves living in in the next 20 to 50 years.

3:09:01.480 --> 3:09:05.640
 So you think technology is going to be one of the part of the solution?

3:09:05.640 --> 3:09:06.640
 Part of the solution.

3:09:06.640 --> 3:09:07.640
 Yeah.

3:09:07.640 --> 3:09:11.800
 But it's, but if we go through and blame it, which is quite possible, we will blame the

3:09:11.800 --> 3:09:15.520
 technology rather than blaming too much of the technology and the too much comes down

3:09:15.520 --> 3:09:20.400
 to what economists have told us, that we can just continue consuming infinitely on a finite

3:09:20.400 --> 3:09:21.400
 planet.

3:09:21.400 --> 3:09:24.960
 And Kenneth Boulding said that beautifully, said the, if somebody believes that they can

3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:31.000
 have exponential growth on a finite planet, they're either mad or they're an economist.

3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:38.840
 So you're, you made a long journey for which I'm deeply honored from, from Sydney, this

3:09:38.840 --> 3:09:42.040
 distant place, there's myth.

3:09:42.040 --> 3:09:43.040
 You've got to go there one day.

3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:44.040
 You'd enjoy it.

3:09:44.040 --> 3:09:45.040
 I will.

3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:47.400
 I'm afraid if, if I go there, I will stay forever.

3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:48.400
 And so.

3:09:48.400 --> 3:09:51.760
 No, it's a bit too, you know, there's, there's more vitality back in this economy, so you'd

3:09:51.760 --> 3:09:52.760
 come back.

3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:53.760
 Okay.

3:09:53.760 --> 3:09:54.760
 Maybe.

3:09:54.760 --> 3:10:02.200
 You know, I'm not a fan of the economy or money or any of that nature calls me.

3:10:02.200 --> 3:10:04.800
 Let me, so I'm honored that you make that trip.

3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:11.280
 You've also said that while you're here in Austin, you're going to go to this American

3:10:11.280 --> 3:10:18.160
 factory that makes cars here in Austin and also visit Starbase.

3:10:18.160 --> 3:10:22.320
 So let me ask you about expanding out into the universe.

3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:25.120
 Is that something that, that excites you?

3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:26.120
 Yeah.

3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:27.120
 You mentioned about the economics of it.

3:10:27.120 --> 3:10:31.600
 Do you think, what, what do you think Marx would think about this?

3:10:31.600 --> 3:10:35.360
 Like what, economically speaking, what, what is this?

3:10:35.360 --> 3:10:36.360
 Is it a good thing?

3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:38.360
 I think it's vital.

3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:42.600
 We can have capitalism in outer space far more successfully than we can have it on the

3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:46.480
 planet because we don't face when we dump the waste ends up in the sun.

3:10:46.480 --> 3:10:47.480
 Not a problem.

3:10:47.480 --> 3:10:48.480
 Okay.

3:10:48.480 --> 3:10:54.600
 Um, so it means the potential, we don't undermine our own productive capacity if we're doing

3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:55.600
 it in outer space.

3:10:55.600 --> 3:10:59.960
 So the destructive element of waste is, has a lesser impact in our business.

3:10:59.960 --> 3:11:04.080
 Yeah, I mean, who cares if we throw a bit of our iron back into the sun again and take

3:11:04.080 --> 3:11:08.040
 a fair bit of it to turn it into a, what it would be, the next stage would be a red giant.

3:11:08.040 --> 3:11:11.960
 Um, and we have to get away because there's a red giant at some stage, it'll, it'll, the

3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:16.840
 sun will head out past the orbit of Mars, I think, certainly past the orbit of earth.

3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:24.240
 So to have the longevity of, of, of just a human life, the life that evolved on this

3:11:24.240 --> 3:11:28.240
 planet, we have to be able to take it off planet ultimately.

3:11:28.240 --> 3:11:33.600
 So if you think in the really long term, then it's our responsibility, we're going to maintain

3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:37.720
 life is to get, is to establish life off the planet.

3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:43.840
 What do you think about robots and AI as part of the expanding out into the future?

3:11:43.840 --> 3:11:44.840
 Oh yeah, we have to.

3:11:44.840 --> 3:11:47.000
 I mean, you, you, that's, that ends labor.

3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:48.720
 You can't be, you can't go for it.

3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:52.600
 You know, your dad, Lejeune can't be from here to the asteroid belt and back again for dinner

3:11:52.600 --> 3:11:53.600
 with your family.

3:11:53.600 --> 3:11:57.040
 Uh, so we, production would be entirely mechanized.

3:11:57.040 --> 3:11:59.920
 Maybe you have to be a handful of people who service the machines, but

3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:02.280
 So it's about production and automation.

3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:07.680
 What about elements of consciousness that make humans so special?

3:12:07.680 --> 3:12:09.600
 What about that persisting within the machine?

3:12:09.600 --> 3:12:13.240
 That, I mean, I'm still a skeptic about us ever being able to create a machine which

3:12:13.240 --> 3:12:14.840
 is truly conscious.

3:12:14.840 --> 3:12:16.800
 If I can throw my, it's almost two cents.

3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:19.360
 That would really piss off Karl Marx, by the way.

3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:21.040
 If we create machines that are conscious.

3:12:21.040 --> 3:12:22.040
 Exactly.

3:12:22.040 --> 3:12:25.120
 This is actually part of the, there's two good logical arguments against the labor theory

3:12:25.120 --> 3:12:26.120
 of value.

3:12:26.120 --> 3:12:28.320
 The one that becomes machines become intelligent.

3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:33.280
 And the other was that if the declining rate of profit applies in socialism, it'll apply

3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:38.080
 as a rate of accumulation in, sorry, in capitalism, it'll apply as a rate of socialism as well.

3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:39.880
 A guy called Khalid made that argument.

3:12:39.880 --> 3:12:42.480
 So his argument was just on sound.

3:12:42.480 --> 3:12:45.760
 But yeah, intelligent machines would completely screw Marx up, you know?

3:12:45.760 --> 3:12:46.760
 Yeah.

3:12:46.760 --> 3:12:51.600
 But do you, do you not like that world where machines have not only intelligence, but

3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:57.720
 their consciousness as well, and I, you know, I know that's one of your interests, one of

3:12:57.720 --> 3:13:00.160
 your potential endeavors.

3:13:00.160 --> 3:13:04.280
 And I'd, the Kurtz will idea that there's some singularity we're approaching as we

3:13:04.280 --> 3:13:06.560
 just get increasing processing power.

3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:09.520
 It's not processing power, it's imagination.

3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:13.520
 And I think whatever the heck that means, whatever the heck that means, yeah.

3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:15.720
 I mean, you, you would have had imaginative insights.

3:13:15.720 --> 3:13:23.640
 Some of your papers on like in motor, in automating motoring between the hyperintelligent machine

3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:27.880
 or the machine human interface, where the standards can be lower for the machine and

3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:28.880
 higher for the human.

3:13:28.880 --> 3:13:29.880
 Okay.

3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:31.560
 That's an insight you would have had at some point.

3:13:31.560 --> 3:13:33.080
 And then you've worked it further.

3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:34.720
 So I've had insights like that as well.

3:13:34.720 --> 3:13:36.400
 And I have no idea where they come from.

3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:40.720
 They just hit me in the head and I sprited them down and they, they solved the problem

3:13:40.720 --> 3:13:43.640
 that I didn't even know my mind was working on.

3:13:43.640 --> 3:13:46.920
 So how can we get a machine to do that?

3:13:46.920 --> 3:13:51.960
 And I do not know the answer, but one thing I think is the potentials.

3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:58.440
 I think we have to create AI that has feelings, AI that wants to survive.

3:13:58.440 --> 3:14:03.960
 Because if you think how our intelligence evolved, it's on this planet in a struggle

3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:08.000
 between predator and prey and intelligent became a survival technique.

3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:13.200
 I find the ideas of Ernest Becker with denial of death really powerful, which is that humans

3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:25.400
 will not only have emotions and are trying to survive, they're able to ponder out in

3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:28.880
 the distant future their mortality.

3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:36.440
 And that is a driving force for even greater creation that animals are able to do, more

3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:38.800
 primitive animals.

3:14:38.800 --> 3:14:45.040
 So there is some element where I agree with you, I think for AI systems to have something

3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:49.240
 like consciousness, they have to fear their mortality.

3:14:49.240 --> 3:14:50.240
 Exactly.

3:14:50.240 --> 3:14:56.320
 And I think that's, if you do it, then you don't, you can't produce an AI whose behavior

3:14:56.320 --> 3:14:58.440
 you can control.

3:14:58.440 --> 3:15:04.200
 I mean, when you have kids, you can't control their behavior.

3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:06.280
 You know, that's the trade off.

3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:07.280
 You give it to an anarchist.

3:15:07.280 --> 3:15:08.280
 Yeah.

3:15:08.280 --> 3:15:13.840
 Like one of my favorite instances in my family life is one of my favorite, one of my, I like

3:15:13.840 --> 3:15:17.640
 all my nurses and nephews, but one's got a real quirk to her.

3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:22.600
 And I was standing over her cot when she was literally like about six months old and she

3:15:22.600 --> 3:15:27.880
 was gurgling away to herself and her father waked his fingers and said, stop making that

3:15:27.880 --> 3:15:28.880
 noise.

3:15:28.880 --> 3:15:33.920
 And this little six month old kid goes, and I said, boy, you're going to have issues with

3:15:33.920 --> 3:15:34.920
 that one night.

3:15:34.920 --> 3:15:35.920
 Yeah.

3:15:35.920 --> 3:15:36.920
 An anarchist was born.

3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:37.920
 Yeah.

3:15:37.920 --> 3:15:41.400
 So you can't control this life you give birth to, and that's, I think that's the threat

3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:42.400
 of AI.

3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:43.840
 That's terrifying and exciting.

3:15:43.840 --> 3:15:44.840
 It is.

3:15:44.840 --> 3:15:49.160
 And I think we should take that risk at some stage, but I think to do it with what actually

3:15:49.160 --> 3:15:55.840
 let artificial intelligence involve in us, environment in which it fears its own death.

3:15:55.840 --> 3:15:56.840
 Yeah.

3:15:56.840 --> 3:15:58.000
 Yeah.

3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:02.720
 I think there's a lot of beauty there, but it's, there's also a lot of fear, a lot of

3:16:02.720 --> 3:16:07.320
 destruction that's possible, so you have to be extremely careful, but that's kind of

3:16:07.320 --> 3:16:12.040
 the cutting edge of which we often operate as a humanity.

3:16:12.040 --> 3:16:13.560
 Let me ask you for advice.

3:16:13.560 --> 3:16:19.680
 Can you give advice to young people in high school and college?

3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:22.400
 Maybe they're interested in economics.

3:16:22.400 --> 3:16:25.040
 Maybe they have other career ideas.

3:16:25.040 --> 3:16:29.480
 What advice would you give them about a career they can have that they can be proud of or

3:16:29.480 --> 3:16:31.760
 a life they can be proud of?

3:16:31.760 --> 3:16:33.960
 Mainly in a career, I say, don't do an economics degree.

3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:34.960
 Okay.

3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:36.960
 I'll say a few.

3:16:36.960 --> 3:16:39.280
 There's a, there's a little book.

3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:41.840
 Econ comics.

3:16:41.840 --> 3:16:48.400
 Econ comics, taking the con out of economics, so they should start with that and then say

3:16:48.400 --> 3:16:50.680
 screw it to an economics degree.

3:16:50.680 --> 3:16:51.680
 Yeah.

3:16:51.680 --> 3:16:56.080
 Because what, what do you learn as an obsolete technology, learning economics at a university

3:16:56.080 --> 3:17:04.800
 is like learning to make astronomy, okay, the centric equilibrium, you know, epicycles

3:17:04.800 --> 3:17:07.000
 being added to make your models fit the data.

3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:11.120
 It's not that economics is not a discipline worth deeply studying.

3:17:11.120 --> 3:17:14.120
 It's that the university education around economics is bad.

3:17:14.120 --> 3:17:15.120
 It's so bad.

3:17:15.120 --> 3:17:16.120
 Yeah.

3:17:16.120 --> 3:17:17.120
 So I'd say learn system dynamics.

3:17:17.120 --> 3:17:21.840
 Do a course in system dynamics, which you can apply in any field and then apply what

3:17:21.840 --> 3:17:26.480
 you learn out of system dynamics to the issues of economics, if that's what interests you.

3:17:26.480 --> 3:17:32.640
 So get a sort of base engineering education, a base engineering education.

3:17:32.640 --> 3:17:35.080
 That is far better than doing an economics degree.

3:17:35.080 --> 3:17:40.160
 In terms of life, you know, my life is pretty chaotic in many, many ways.

3:17:40.160 --> 3:17:44.360
 My friends and family will tell me that every opportunity.

3:17:44.360 --> 3:17:48.680
 But the thing is, I once had this, I'll tell you an example of a really funny incident

3:17:48.680 --> 3:17:51.760
 that occurred to me because I led the student revolt at Sydney University, as I mentioned

3:17:51.760 --> 3:17:52.760
 was 20 years old.

3:17:52.760 --> 3:17:53.760
 This is great.

3:17:53.760 --> 3:17:57.840
 And then in my, I think about 28 or so, I went to a restaurant one night and I found

3:17:57.840 --> 3:18:03.200
 a bunch of guys, all guys who'd done accounting at the university, but it also been part of

3:18:03.200 --> 3:18:04.760
 the student revolt.

3:18:04.760 --> 3:18:07.920
 So they hadn't seen me for about a decade and they said, what have you been doing, Steve?

3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:08.920
 And I talked about what I'd done.

3:18:08.920 --> 3:18:10.960
 So I've been a school teacher for a while.

3:18:10.960 --> 3:18:13.360
 I then worked in overseas aid.

3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:17.680
 I was doing computer programming at this time and I've forgotten what I was also doing

3:18:17.680 --> 3:18:18.680
 at that point.

3:18:18.680 --> 3:18:21.080
 So I explained it to all of them and they were at a bucks night, one of them having

3:18:21.080 --> 3:18:23.480
 a wedding, you know, coming up the next week.

3:18:23.480 --> 3:18:27.040
 And one of them said, I wish I'd done that.

3:18:27.040 --> 3:18:31.360
 And there was silence around the table that was obviously silent agreement.

3:18:31.360 --> 3:18:35.560
 And I looked at them and said, hang on guys, look at the downside of my life.

3:18:35.560 --> 3:18:38.120
 You know, like, you've all, you're getting married.

3:18:38.120 --> 3:18:41.000
 I don't have a girlfriend right now.

3:18:41.000 --> 3:18:42.960
 You've all got secure jobs.

3:18:42.960 --> 3:18:43.960
 I'm unemployed.

3:18:43.960 --> 3:18:44.960
 Okay.

3:18:44.960 --> 3:18:45.960
 I've done it.

3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:46.960
 You own a house.

3:18:46.960 --> 3:18:47.960
 I haven't even got a car.

3:18:47.960 --> 3:18:48.960
 You know, look at the downside of my life.

3:18:48.960 --> 3:18:51.080
 And the bloke was the kingpin of that group.

3:18:51.080 --> 3:18:54.240
 They're very innovative bunch of guys in the student revolt.

3:18:54.240 --> 3:19:01.200
 And you said, Steve, we would still all rather have done what you have done.

3:19:01.200 --> 3:19:03.160
 And they did accounting because it was safe.

3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:04.160
 Yeah.

3:19:04.160 --> 3:19:05.160
 You always get a job.

3:19:05.160 --> 3:19:06.880
 And they were bored shitless.

3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:14.520
 Did you have a sense that the chaos you're always jumping into was dangerous or was it

3:19:14.520 --> 3:19:16.920
 just the pull of it that?

3:19:16.920 --> 3:19:18.480
 I simply couldn't not do it.

3:19:18.480 --> 3:19:19.480
 Yeah.

3:19:19.480 --> 3:19:22.120
 It was part of me that I couldn't swallow this economic stuff.

3:19:22.120 --> 3:19:29.000
 Once I was exposed to why it was so wrong, then I was on a, on a crusade to make it right.

3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:31.360
 And that's been part of my nature all through my life.

3:19:31.360 --> 3:19:32.840
 I don't know why.

3:19:32.840 --> 3:19:37.880
 So it wasn't that I made a choice to do it is that I couldn't be true to myself without

3:19:37.880 --> 3:19:38.880
 doing it.

3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:42.240
 And I find a lot of people get caught in a life where they're doing it because it works

3:19:42.240 --> 3:19:46.280
 for some financial or other reason, but they're not being true to themselves.

3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:49.600
 And as, as messy as my life is, much shit I've got myself caught up in.

3:19:49.600 --> 3:19:53.240
 And there's a lot of that in my personal and financial life right now, which is a pain

3:19:53.240 --> 3:19:55.600
 in the ass.

3:19:55.600 --> 3:19:58.640
 I would rather have had that nature than not.

3:19:58.640 --> 3:20:02.680
 You would rather take the pain in the ass than not.

3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:06.040
 Let me ask a dark question.

3:20:06.040 --> 3:20:09.760
 What's the darkest place you've ever gone to in your mind?

3:20:09.760 --> 3:20:14.960
 So in all that roller coaster of life, have there been periods where it's been really

3:20:14.960 --> 3:20:19.560
 I think I've had to cope with depression in the last five years.

3:20:19.560 --> 3:20:24.720
 Since I started reading neoclassical economists on climate change, okay, sorry to come back

3:20:24.720 --> 3:20:25.720
 to that one.

3:20:25.720 --> 3:20:28.080
 So that's where my wife's going to come into this story.

3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:34.520
 So I was reading Richard Toll paper from 2009 called the economics of climate change

3:20:34.520 --> 3:20:37.280
 journal of economic perspectives, I think.

3:20:37.280 --> 3:20:43.280
 And I read this section where he says that one of the ways they tried to calibrate what

3:20:43.280 --> 3:20:48.520
 climate change was do is they assumed that the relationship between GDP and temperature

3:20:48.520 --> 3:20:52.240
 over space would apply at the time as well.

3:20:52.240 --> 3:20:53.240
 Yes.

3:20:53.240 --> 3:20:59.440
 And I read that and thought that is so fucking stupid, because all it's saying is that there's

3:20:59.440 --> 3:21:03.680
 a 10 degree temperature difference between New York and Florida and a 20% difference

3:21:03.680 --> 3:21:08.400
 in income than a 10 degree increase in temperature will cause GDP by four by 20%.

3:21:08.400 --> 3:21:10.320
 It is so insanely stupid.

3:21:10.320 --> 3:21:14.560
 So when that read that line, I just did this.

3:21:14.560 --> 3:21:18.280
 I just, you know, I was in shock at how stupid it was.

3:21:18.280 --> 3:21:24.760
 My wife, whose tie and brings in treats for me all day, walks into the room and says,

3:21:24.760 --> 3:21:29.320
 and she speaks in a staccato English and says to me, why are you like this?

3:21:29.320 --> 3:21:31.720
 And I said, I'm just doing this work on climate change.

3:21:31.720 --> 3:21:35.120
 And she interrupts me, says, oh, why do you do that stuff?

3:21:35.120 --> 3:21:36.720
 Nobody's interested in climate change.

3:21:36.720 --> 3:21:38.040
 You can't do anything to change it.

3:21:38.040 --> 3:21:39.720
 If we die, we die.

3:21:39.720 --> 3:21:44.320
 And that perfect Buddhist grounding.

3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:50.440
 And I thought, well, I can't argue with her again, you know, so that sort of stopped me

3:21:50.440 --> 3:21:53.960
 on the depression, but that's the darkest point when I looked at it and I thought that

3:21:53.960 --> 3:22:02.080
 this arrogance, this stupidity, this humbug and the economists meant that we were potentially

3:22:02.080 --> 3:22:08.040
 jeopardizing the lives of billions of people and Christ knows how many other life forms.

3:22:08.040 --> 3:22:13.800
 And the having that knowledge is the most depressing experience of my life.

3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:23.360
 That ideas, simple models, combined with arrogance, can lead to the potential destruction of human

3:22:23.360 --> 3:22:24.360
 civilization.

3:22:24.360 --> 3:22:32.080
 That was a very heavy, and then your wife came in with the nature, nature wins in the

3:22:32.080 --> 3:22:35.840
 end and sort of accepts the flow of life.

3:22:35.840 --> 3:22:39.800
 You should really enjoy that book, The Earth of Arts, because it's got that same beautiful

3:22:39.800 --> 3:22:41.240
 sense to it.

3:22:41.240 --> 3:22:42.680
 Life will survive whatever we do.

3:22:42.680 --> 3:22:46.600
 I mean, they talk about the people, I was actually talking with a good mate of mine,

3:22:46.600 --> 3:22:50.840
 an ex geologist and he's now a professor of economics, and he said as a geologist, he

3:22:50.840 --> 3:22:54.880
 really hated people talking about the Anthropocene epoch.

3:22:54.880 --> 3:22:59.080
 And I said, well, it's not, it shouldn't be the Anthropocene epoch, it'll be the Anthropocene

3:22:59.080 --> 3:23:06.960
 event, because an epoch is millions of years and a huge period of life on the planet.

3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:12.360
 And we might be snuffed out in 10,000 years of human civilization.

3:23:12.360 --> 3:23:16.760
 And that's not much slower than the meteors wiping out the dinosaurs.

3:23:16.760 --> 3:23:19.480
 The dinosaurs lasted for a long time after that event.

3:23:19.480 --> 3:23:26.520
 So we're like, we'd just be a layer in the surface of the planet with plastics and strange

3:23:26.520 --> 3:23:29.080
 metals like that at some point.

3:23:29.080 --> 3:23:33.520
 So we're just, the life will abide, life will survive us, but there's so much life

3:23:33.520 --> 3:23:37.360
 we're going to take down with us in this whole period.

3:23:37.360 --> 3:23:43.000
 And there's so many of our own lives we're going to terminate for no good reason.

3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:47.400
 I'm looking at this Richard Toll character, I'll definitely have to look at some of his

3:23:47.400 --> 3:23:48.400
 papers.

3:23:48.400 --> 3:23:52.960
 It does look like, boy, is the oversimplifying and do a lot of things.

3:23:52.960 --> 3:23:53.960
 Oh my God.

3:23:53.960 --> 3:23:57.480
 Check is one on the Anthropocene, on how good it'll be to lose Amock.

3:23:57.480 --> 3:24:03.880
 That said, I'm going to approach all of these topics with humility and I would like to have

3:24:03.880 --> 3:24:10.080
 some conversations if people can recommend, my default position is always with the scientists,

3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:14.760
 but even above that, my default position is with those who are humble versus those who

3:24:14.760 --> 3:24:16.960
 are arrogant.

3:24:16.960 --> 3:24:21.760
 This idea that because you're a quote unquote expert, you deserve to have arrogance is a

3:24:21.760 --> 3:24:23.160
 silly idea to me.

3:24:23.160 --> 3:24:29.960
 Again, going to the broader view of life on earth, nature, nature is the only one that

3:24:29.960 --> 3:24:35.320
 gets to be arrogant and it chooses not to.

3:24:35.320 --> 3:24:39.040
 So let me ask you about love.

3:24:39.040 --> 3:24:41.720
 What role does love play in this whole thing?

3:24:41.720 --> 3:24:43.760
 The Karl Marx model for that?

3:24:43.760 --> 3:24:49.160
 Oh, Marx was madly in love with Genevon Westhawen and wrote love poetry to her long before he

3:24:49.160 --> 3:24:51.240
 wrote Das Kapital.

3:24:51.240 --> 3:24:57.040
 And he was infatuated with her, he ended up also impregnating his housekeeper.

3:24:57.040 --> 3:25:02.320
 So there's a son of Karl Marx, who was the son of the housekeeper, not the Jenny.

3:25:02.320 --> 3:25:05.600
 There are numerous daughters.

3:25:05.600 --> 3:25:09.200
 So he had a complicated view of love.

3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:10.200
 Oh yeah.

3:25:10.200 --> 3:25:12.480
 So there's a dialectic on love there.

3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:19.920
 He had an idealistic view with Jenny and he was rejected because he wasn't, not by Jenny,

3:25:19.920 --> 3:25:22.000
 she was madly in love with him as well.

3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:25.400
 So it was a real passionate love affair from the very outset.

3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:28.280
 But then of course you have children, lots of them die.

3:25:28.280 --> 3:25:31.200
 There's a huge amount of tragedy in his life as well.

3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:37.160
 He and Jenny were forced out of Chelsea by a cholera epidemic.

3:25:37.160 --> 3:25:43.600
 My vision for London back in the 1850s and 60s was Calcutta in the 1970s.

3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:45.200
 That's really what life was like.

3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:48.000
 So there's a lot of hardship in his life as well.

3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:50.640
 And he was always poor.

3:25:50.640 --> 3:25:54.760
 So only Ingalls kept him alive financially.

3:25:54.760 --> 3:26:01.680
 He applied for one job outside of, he never got an academic job.

3:26:01.680 --> 3:26:04.560
 He was pushed out of Prussia as a newspaper author.

3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:10.440
 But he also applied for a job as a clerk in the British Railway system, was turned down

3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:12.880
 because they couldn't read his handwriting.

3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:18.760
 So I think I'm a bit similar there.

3:26:18.760 --> 3:26:21.120
 So yeah, there's a lot of love and passion.

3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:24.560
 But in general, what do you think is the role of love in the human condition?

3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:25.560
 It's vital.

3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:33.520
 It's, I mean, that feeling of passionate desire and respect for somebody else.

3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:36.440
 And there's perverted forms of love as well, so I'll leave that out.

3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:43.320
 But somebody having a really deep bond which goes beyond just sexual attraction.

3:26:43.320 --> 3:26:47.440
 I look, I've had that four or five times in my life with different women at different

3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:48.440
 times.

3:26:48.440 --> 3:26:52.880
 And I've stuffed up the most important one very early on.

3:26:52.880 --> 3:26:56.160
 And that feeling is incredible.

3:26:56.160 --> 3:27:01.560
 And you couldn't have life worth living without that.

3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:04.040
 So it's an essential part of who we are.

3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:08.760
 But what we have to do is to transfer it not just to the rest of our species, but to all

3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:10.480
 the species.

3:27:10.480 --> 3:27:12.920
 And that's, I think, what's vital.

3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:16.880
 And how do we maintain that over generations?

3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:22.200
 And I think that idea that we can actually hang onto that general sense of respect and

3:27:22.200 --> 3:27:23.200
 not lose it again.

3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:29.800
 Because the amount of life we've terminated on this planet, the warlike side of humanity,

3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:32.920
 that is too much of a defining feature of our species.

3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:35.160
 It's the opposite of love, it's hate.

3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:37.160
 But it's pleasure and inflicting pain on others.

3:27:37.160 --> 3:27:42.480
 When you see people killing others in a warlike environment, they're enjoying themselves.

3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:47.320
 It's rarely, sometimes it's self defense, but there's, when you talk spoken to people

3:27:47.320 --> 3:27:52.080
 who have been involved in combat and been involved in riots and said, when you see somebody

3:27:52.080 --> 3:27:54.880
 rioting, bashing people up, they're enjoying themselves.

3:27:54.880 --> 3:27:56.400
 It's not anger, they're feeling it's pleasure.

3:27:56.400 --> 3:27:58.840
 Yeah, there's a dark aspect to human nature.

3:27:58.840 --> 3:27:59.840
 Very dark.

3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:04.600
 But there's also the capacity to rise above that.

3:28:04.600 --> 3:28:08.560
 And I think, like I put us on a spectrum between chimpanzees at one extreme and bonobos

3:28:08.560 --> 3:28:09.560
 at the other.

3:28:09.560 --> 3:28:10.560
 Yeah.

3:28:10.560 --> 3:28:12.760
 We're too close to the chimpanzees, you know.

3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:15.200
 And bonobos are just having fun, having lots of sex.

3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:18.520
 Every time they do anything, they fuck first and do the work later, and then fuck afterwards

3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:19.840
 to celebrate, you know.

3:28:19.840 --> 3:28:21.840
 Fuck first, ask questions later.

3:28:21.840 --> 3:28:27.120
 It's like that Scent of a Woman, one of my favorite films where Al Pacino gives advice

3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:28.620
 to a cat.

3:28:28.620 --> 3:28:32.920
 He says, when in doubt, fuck.

3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:36.120
 It's good life advice for a cat especially.

3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:42.120
 We mentioned that death seems to be maybe fundamental to creating a conscious AI.

3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:43.360
 All right.

3:28:43.360 --> 3:28:45.560
 Do you think about your own death?

3:28:45.560 --> 3:28:49.880
 Do you, are you afraid of it?

3:28:49.880 --> 3:28:52.600
 I'm afraid of going through it.

3:28:52.600 --> 3:28:55.360
 Not the other side.

3:28:55.360 --> 3:28:56.840
 You're not afraid of being on the other side.

3:28:56.840 --> 3:28:58.320
 I don't think there is another side.

3:28:58.320 --> 3:29:00.720
 I mean, I'm agnostic.

3:29:00.720 --> 3:29:02.720
 I'm atheist when pressed and agnostic.

3:29:02.720 --> 3:29:07.360
 The one thing that I think I can understand why religion exists is that the whole thing

3:29:07.360 --> 3:29:11.240
 that something exists is itself a dilemma.

3:29:11.240 --> 3:29:16.480
 You have to take on faith that reality exists, whether it's a simulation or actual reality.

3:29:16.480 --> 3:29:20.680
 It exists and that itself can't be explained in any scientific manner.

3:29:20.680 --> 3:29:25.360
 I mean, you can talk about anti protons and protons and the sum being zero and so on,

3:29:25.360 --> 3:29:27.680
 but why did it even happen in the first place?

3:29:27.680 --> 3:29:31.760
 So there's part you simply have to take on faith.

3:29:31.760 --> 3:29:34.720
 So there was darkness before.

3:29:34.720 --> 3:29:35.720
 We don't know.

3:29:35.720 --> 3:29:36.720
 And there's darkness after.

3:29:36.720 --> 3:29:37.720
 Yeah.

3:29:37.720 --> 3:29:39.520
 And I don't know if we're going to be alive on the other side of that darkness.

3:29:39.520 --> 3:29:45.120
 I think individually no, but the way you can live on is by what you do to human consciousness.

3:29:45.120 --> 3:29:49.760
 How do you hope people remember you?

3:29:49.760 --> 3:29:57.080
 As someone who managed to integrate economics with an appreciation for life?

3:29:57.080 --> 3:30:05.360
 Well, I have to say as a bit of a callback, you're one deadly bastard.

3:30:05.360 --> 3:30:09.320
 It's a huge honor that you would come down and talk to me.

3:30:09.320 --> 3:30:10.400
 You're a brilliant person.

3:30:10.400 --> 3:30:11.800
 You're a hilarious person.

3:30:11.800 --> 3:30:12.920
 The humility shines through.

3:30:12.920 --> 3:30:13.920
 The brilliance shines through.

3:30:13.920 --> 3:30:14.920
 Thank you so much.

3:30:14.920 --> 3:30:15.920
 Thank you, Alex.

3:30:15.920 --> 3:30:16.920
 Thanks for spending this time.

3:30:16.920 --> 3:30:17.920
 You do the same for humanity.

3:30:17.920 --> 3:30:21.160
 I mean, when I saw that email from you, my eyes popped out on my head.

3:30:21.160 --> 3:30:22.160
 Yeah.

3:30:22.160 --> 3:30:23.160
 Okay.

3:30:23.160 --> 3:30:24.160
 Well, you should hold your judgment.

3:30:24.160 --> 3:30:26.160
 I got to show you the sex dungeon I have.

3:30:26.160 --> 3:30:27.160
 You'll complete it.

3:30:27.160 --> 3:30:28.160
 Well, I'm waiting for an invitation.

3:30:28.160 --> 3:30:30.160
 I'll send my wife over.

3:30:30.160 --> 3:30:31.160
 Awesome.

3:30:31.160 --> 3:30:32.160
 Can't wait.

3:30:32.160 --> 3:30:33.160
 All right.

3:30:33.160 --> 3:30:34.160
 I can't wait.

3:30:34.160 --> 3:30:36.320
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Steve Keen.

3:30:36.320 --> 3:30:40.360
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:30:40.360 --> 3:30:44.360
 And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.

3:30:44.360 --> 3:30:49.920
 To be radical is to grasp things at their root.

3:30:49.920 --> 3:31:14.680
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
